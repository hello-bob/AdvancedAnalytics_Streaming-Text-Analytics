Governor Kathy Hochul recently struck a\nbudget deal with leaders in the state legislature that includes a program to\nboost residential construction. At the same time, Mayor Eric Adams is pushing\nhis \u201cCity of Yes\u201d plan, loaded with zoning tweaks meant to sprinkle new\nconstruction around all five boroughs. Even before anyone had a chance to\nanalyze the specific measures, anti-density artillery was being rolled out to\nshoot down both proposals, or at least riddle them with exceptions. Months\nago, the Adams proposal was already taking heat at public hearings in\nBrooklyn. The organization Equality for Flatbush warned in an Instagram post\nthat \u201cRezonings ARE ALWAYS about corporate greed, gentrification and the\ndisplacement of New Yorkers. @nycplanning [the Department of City Planning\u2019s]\nsole purpose is to gentrify #NYC.\u201d More recently, Paul Graziano, a Queens-\nbased urban-planning consultant, has been trying to mobilize Queens with a\npresentation aimed at killing both state and local proposals. It\u2019s titled\n\u201cCity of Yes and Housing Opportunity: How These Two Packages Are an Extinction\nEvent for Our Communities in Queens and Beyond.\u201d On this issue, Gen-Z Black\nLives Matter activists and middle-aged mortgage holders who live in single-\nfamily homes stand shoulder to shoulder.\n\nAnd yet everyone knows that New York needs more apartments: affordable, market\nrate, small, big, cheap, luxurious \u2014 whatever. Just more. And many New Yorkers\nwould love to see new housing get built, so long as it\u2019s the right kind in the\nright place, which is to say somewhere they don\u2019t have to look at it \u2014\nsomewhere new residents won\u2019t compete for their parking spaces, jam their\nsubways, overload their sewers, or threaten the precious character of their\nneighborhoods. Suburbanites and conservatives have long been candid about why\nthey oppose greater density in quiet residential areas: It brings the wrong\nkind of (poor) people, disturbs the local (racial) equilibrium, and depresses\nproperty values. Anti-gentrification progressives oppose new development in\ncities for reasons that are both similar and opposite: It brings the wrong\nkind of (rich) people, disturbs the local (racial) equilibrium, and boosts\nproperty values. The upshot is a severe housing shortage that has spread out\nfrom grotesquely distorted markets like New York, Boston, and San Francisco to\nhit smaller cities and heartland towns.\n\nIn a persuasive new article published by Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing\nStudies, the urban historian Jacob Anbinder traces that strange consensus, and\nthe crisis it birthed, to a shift in liberal New York politics in the late\n1960s. As the city suffered and the middle class fled, many urban liberals\nblamed the previous generations\u2019 top down, blunt-instrument housing policies.\nThe strategies of mass demolition, urban renewal, public housing, and highway\nconstruction had done nearly as much damage to American cities as American\nbombers had to the physical structure of German cities during World War II.\nThe New Leftists felt that the only way to reverse the raze-it-all approach to\nurbanism was to smash the pols\u2019 monopoly on control and scatter it to ordinary\npeople who knew what their block needed and what was worth protecting. Norman\nMailer conducted a rabble-rousing campaign for mayor on the slogan \u201cPower to\nthe Neighborhoods!\u201d He hoped to unseat the more even-keeled Establishment\nfigure John Lindsay, who floated a similar idea of peppering the metropolis\nwith \u201clittle city halls.\u201d That kind of talk emboldened residents of Forest\nHills to fight the big City Hall and try to block Lindsay\u2019s plan for a new\npublic-housing project there. None of those warriors got much traction. Mailer\ngot creamed in the election. Lindsay could barely hold on in a city that was\nspinning out of control, and Forest Hills had to swallow the new project.\n\nThe 1968 campaign flier for Norman Mailer\u2019s mayoral campaign with running mate\nJimmy Breslin on a neighborhood-empowerment platform.\n\nStill, the idea of giving ordinary New Yorkers a louder voice in local affairs\nproved popular and enduring, and it eventually embedded itself in the\ninstitutions of governance. It also established a standard, more or less\ndemocratic procedure to approve zoning changes and variances: the Uniform Land\nUse Review Process. ULURP (pronounced You-lerp by those in the know) codified\nneighborhood consultation as part of the development process. A revised city\ncharter in 1975 gave community boards, made up of part-time appointees, an\nexplicit role in deciding what, how, and where to build. Consequently,\ndevelopers who need some concession from the city on a new project \u2014 a taller\ntower, say, or an affordable-housing subsidy \u2014 begin by trying to win over the\ncommunity board, or, in Anbinder\u2019s terminology, a \u201chandful of unelected\nneighborhood notables.\u201d Well-run community boards perform plenty of crucial\ntasks, mediating between the municipal technocracy and locals\u2019 deeper\nunderstanding of the urban terroir. But one of their principal tasks remains\nto challenge plans, balk at development, and demand more public benefits, a\nprocess that inevitably slows the pace of new housing and raises its costs.\nAnbinder argues that the movement he calls the New Neighborhoodism amounted to\nhanding out vetoes over new construction of all kinds with predictable\nresults. He quotes an aide to Mayor Ed Koch complaining about the politics of\nresistance in 1982: \u201cSanitation garages, methadone centers, halfway houses.\nYou name it. People don\u2019t want it.\u201d That attitude effectively meant\nprioritizing the protective urges of each small enclave over citywide needs \u2014\nwith results that have become clear half a century later. \u201cThe restrictions on\nurban development that marked the era of neighborhood liberalism set the stage\nfor the severe housing shortages that New York and similar cities would\nexperience in the twenty-first century,\u201d Anbinder writes. If you can\u2019t find an\napartment under $4,000 a month today, you have Mailer, Lindsay, and the Forest\nHills protesters to thank. The Adams administration\u2019s plan consists mostly of\na package of common-sense rule changes that have been adopted in other parts\nof the country without causing skies to fall. It allows small apartment\nbuildings near transit stops, gets rid of requirements to build unnecessary\nparking structures, and makes it easier to convert fallow office towers into\nresidential buildings. But the details don\u2019t matter much when you\u2019re primed to\nsay no.\n\nAnbinder sees opposition to new housing as an ideology, the kind that cherry-\npicks justifications, tunes out discordant data, and cultivates dramatic\nrhetoric. (Stop the bulldozers!) It anoints an enemy \u2014 developers, in this\ncase \u2014 and endows them with powers amplified by collusion with elected\nofficials. It\u2019s a philosophy of rejection, specific in its aims and adaptable\nin its rationales. \u201cIn order for an ideology to be widely embraced by diverse\ngroups of people, you need to provide multiple entry points,\u201d Anbinder says.\n\u201cFor leftists, that\u2019s community self-determination. For a white-collar\naestheticist, it\u2019s historic preservation.\u201d\n\nOf course, YIMBYism is an ideology, too, predicated on the proposition that\ndensity is a self-evident good. Cities, the argument goes, should provide\nshelter to as many people as possible on the smallest possible expanse of\nland. (Ideal density would liberate acreage from sprawl and return it to\nnature.) That imperative must preempt any special pleading or sentimental\nallegiance to the way things used to be. Both philosophies have their\nfundamentalist extremes, but NIMBYism has been more sweepingly influential for\ndecades. That\u2019s partly, Anbinder suggests, because it offers a more\nstraightforward narrative and a clearer path to success. \u201cAnti-growthers draw\na visceral connection between what\u2019s happening around them and social issues,\u201d\nhe says: New and bigger buildings breed crime and drugs, for instance; or new\nand bigger buildings will force you out of your home. \u201cYIMBYs haven\u2019t figured\nout how to do that as well. The reality of how to fix the housing crisis is\ncomplicated. You might argue that you\u2019ve successfully cut the rate of price\ngrowth from 10 percent to 5 percent, say, but it\u2019s hard to sell that as a\nvictory.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, the Power to the Neighborhoods! program produced the opposite\nof its ambitions: a city that is less affordable, less democratic, and less\nnimble \u2014 a city where a 23-year-old married ex-GI with literary ambitions\nwould never find his first walk-up apartment in Brooklyn Heights, as Mailer\ndid. \u201cThe antigrowth revolt was a very understandable reaction to a very dire\nsituation\u201d in the \u201960s and \u201970s, Anbinder says. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of people who\nwere bold enough to see changes that needed to be made and made them. But it\u2019s\nalso a tragic story of how those well-intentioned changes sowed the seeds of\nthe housing crisis. Those reactions were understandable in their time. Today,\nwe face a new set of challenges.\u201d\n\n## Related\n\n  * How a New York City Councilwoman Lost Her Job for Doing the Right Thing\n  * A Basement Housing Bill Killed by Conspiracists\n  * Long Island NIMBYs May Be Winning Housing Fight\n\nSee All\n\n### Tags:\n\n  * street view\n  * nimbyism\n  * neighborhoods\n  * ulurp\n  * housing supply\n  * yimby\n  * community boards\n  * norman mailer\n  * john lindsay\n  * jacob anbinder\n  * More\n\nShow 5 Comments / 5 New Leave a Comment\n\nWhere NIMBYs Got Their Veto Power\n\nEvery product is independently selected by editors.
