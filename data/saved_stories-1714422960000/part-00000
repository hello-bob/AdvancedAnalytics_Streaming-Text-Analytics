With the\nintroduction of online multiplayer, among many other changes and improvements,\nit marked a pivotal moment in the history of the game.\n\nAfterwards, it was decided to commit to a policy of version compatibility:\ninstead of making breaking changes that would prevent online play between\ndifferent 1.x versions or would make it impossible to compare records between\nversions, game mechanics and tracks have been kept functionally identical,\nwith very few exceptions (such as expanding some checklines).\n\nInstead, the focus of development has been centered on improving all the other\naspects of the STK experience. Releases from 1.1 to 1.4 have featured,\nalongside numerous bugfixes and UI improvements, many significant\nenhancements.\n\nSome of these were very visible, such as the release of new arenas and kart\nmodels, all tracks included inside mobile releases, the introduction of render\nresolution scaling, a basketball minimap indicator, a brand new cartoon skin,\ncustomizable font size, new respawn animations of track items, etc.\n\nOthers have been more discreet but no less important, such as support for IPv6\nservers or the adoption of SDL2 (improving compatibility with gamepads,\nsimplifying ports to new platforms and more). The overall changelog contains\nmore details.\n\n# SuperTuxKart 1.5 is coming this summer\n\nA year and a half after the release of version 1.4, SuperTuxKart 1.5 is\nfinally around the corner. The list of changes that will be included is not\nyet finalized, but it brings some notable improvements, such as:\n\n  * Allow to configure STK\u2019s maximum FPS within the game\u2019s options, instead of being limited to a maximum of 120 (30 for Android). The game\u2019s physics, running independently from the framerate, remain at 120FPS.\n  * New LoD (Level of Detail) settings to reduce \"popping\" for a minor performance cost. As STK is fairly easy to run on modern systems, this is an appreciable quality improvement.\n  * A new benchmark mode\n  * Finer control of the game\u2019s audio levels\n  * And of course the usual minor bugfixes and improvements\n\nThe new framelimiter configuration and integrated benchmark  \n---  \n  \nThere are always many further enhancements and fixes that we would like to see\nin the next release, but the STK team wants to bring all the existing\nimprovements to the players sooner than later: the release of STK 1.5 is\nexpected this summer.\n\nBut this is not the most significant announcement in this blog post.\n\n# SuperTuxKart 2.0: an ambitious project\n\nAfter the release of 1.5, development efforts will officially switch towards\nSuperTuxKart 2.0, featuring major gameplay changes and more significant track\nupdates than any single STK release in the last fifteen years.\n\nA 1.6 release featuring some backported bugfixes and improvements may happen,\nbut providing a new major release will be the project\u2019s priority.\n\nThe 2.0 version will feature a minimum of five new high-quality standard\ntracks, improved versions of all existing tracks, alongside considerable\nchanges and improvements to all the elements of gameplay.\n\nA substantial proportion of these changes already exist in an experimental\nbranch I created at the end of 2023, coming back from a long break, to start\nimplementing and testing them. This branch, which will be merged in the main\ndevelopment codebase after the release of 1.5, already features major\nrevisions, such as three brand new powerups and a new kart class. Future blog\nposts will elaborate on the various changes and features coming for 2.0.\n\nAn early showcase of one of the new powerups  \n---  \n  \nOn the track-making side, efforts are led by Sven Andreas Belting, our lead\nartist and designer of Black Forest. He is working on several new track\nprojects (many already quite advanced), as well as updates to several tracks,\nbe they graphical or, in coordination with myself, related to gameplay.\nTyphon306 is also providing significant help.\n\nA preview of two of the new tracks  \n---  \n  \nOur aim is to significantly raise the standard of visual quality for tracks\nincluded in SuperTuxKart 2.0, while also providing improved polish and\ngameplay.\n\nAs versions following STK 2.0 will also follow the compatibility principle, we\naim for a particularly high-quality for everything that will remain the same\nin 2.1 and other 2.x releases. Beyond the kart properties, physics, powerups,\nand obviously standard tracks, this includes things such as a new AI, more fun\nto play against, and a brand new Story Mode. Nonetheless, we would also like\nto lift other parts of the game; for example better performance from the\nengine and progress on the Vulkan renderer, improvement of non-racing modes,\nrefreshing the GUI, featuring some new musics, or an improved addons system.\n\n# A labor of love\n\nWe are very excited for this, in the genuine sense of the word exciting, that\nsoulless corporate-speak sometimes makes us forget. It is difficult, however,\nto provide a solid estimate for when this major release will happen. The\nSuperTuxKart project is alive, has a clear vision and is moving towards some\nimportant milestones, but it is also a project of passion carried by a small\nteam.\n\nIt is still moving forward because contributors (most having spent more time\nplaying the game than we would like to admit) want it to become better. Its\nfree software licensing allows interested people to contribute.\n\nBut this also means that, unlike commercial games, the STK project cannot pay\ndedicated full-time developers and artists. It often feels better to do\nsomething for free, willingly, for the sake of a work well done, than to do it\nfor a paltry amount of money; and recruiting freelancers to do some things\nwhile key contributors investing much more time get nothing also seems wrong.\nRaising enough funds from the community to truly change this approach has\nalways seemed too far-fetched.\n\nThe story of STK is that of the successes of free software games, but also of\ntheir struggles.\n\nHence, to make SuperTuxKart a better game and to reach the 2.0 release sooner,\nthe most important thing we need are new contributors, be they helping with a\nfew specific things or with many. Artists who could contribute new textures,\n3D modelling, music, icons; developers who could implement features, fix bugs,\nimprove the code structure or work on the engine; contributors willing to\nimprove documentation, create content advertising the game or meticulously\nreport bugs: there is no shortage of things that could help.\n\n# Final words\n\nThis blog featured no updates since 1.4\u2019s release, as the activity around the\nproject slowed down until my comeback, and other contributors of the project\nwere not inspired to write. We want to avoid such a hiatus happening again.\n\nI will try to provide in this blog, every one or two months, an update on\nSuperTuxKart\u2019s progress: future plans, detailed presentation of a new feature,\netc.\n\nPosted by Alayan at 10:20 PM\n\n#### 3 comments:\n\n  1.
