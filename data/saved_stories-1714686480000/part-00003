The subject, whose name is redacted in the complaint, is a public\nfigure, so some information about him is online, but his date of birth is not.\nChatGPT, therefore, had a go at inferring it but returned the wrong date.\n\nThe subject then filed a request to have the incorrect data erased, according\nto noyb's complaint, which alleges there was no way to prevent an inaccurate\ndate of birth from being returned without blocking all information held on the\nsubject.\n\n  * Jensen Huang and Sam Altman among tech chiefs invited to federal AI Safety Board\n  * Meta's value plummets as Zuckerberg admits AI needs more time and money\n  * EU tells Meta it can't paywall privacy\n  * The UK Digital Information Bill: Brexit dividend or data disaster?\n\nAccording to the complaint: \"The controller does not seem to have any option\nto actually correct false information, but can only 'hide' at the final output\nstage of the processing.\" In this case, the data controller it is referring to\nis OpenAI.\n\nThis situation is less than ideal where European data protection law the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is concerned. The law is quite clear\non the matter \u2013 personal data must be accurate, and individuals have a right\nto have it changed if it is inaccurate.\n\nMaartje de Graaf, data protection lawyer at noyb, said: \"Making up false\ninformation is quite problematic in itself. But when it comes to false\ninformation about individuals, there can be serious consequences.\n\n\"It's clear that companies are currently unable to make chatbots like ChatGPT\ncomply with EU law when processing data about individuals. If a system cannot\nproduce accurate and transparent results, it cannot be used to generate data\nabout individuals. The technology has to follow the legal requirements, not\nthe other way around.\"\n\nThis is not the first run-in AI models have had with privacy laws. A 2023\npaper highlighted the issue, and it has been noted that Large Language Models,\nsuch as the ones on which ChatGPT is based, have difficulties staying\ncompliant due to how they process and store information. Earlier in 2023,\nItaly imposed a temporary restriction on the use of ChatGPT over data privacy\nconcerns.\n\nA spokesperson for noyb told The Register that the complaint had been filed in\nAustria as that was where the complainant lives. However, the group expected\nit to be forwarded to the Irish authority since OpenAI is located there.\n\nA fine is also a possibility, as is a request that authorities order OpenAI to\ncomply with the complainant's access request. The noyb spokesperson said: \"We\nwould expect the sanction to be 'effective, proportionate and dissuasive,' as\nrequested by the GDPR. The assessment of the amount of the fine should also\ntake into account OpenAI's worldwide turnover.\"\n\nUnder GDPR's fine framework, an org may be given a penalty of up to four\npercent of its total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, depending\non the severity of the breach.\n\nThe Register contacted OpenAI to get its opinion on the complaint, and the Sam\nAltman-run super lab has yet to respond. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * GDPR\n  * OpenAI\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * GDPR\n  * OpenAI\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * ChatGPT\n  * cookies\n  * Copilot\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Max Schrems\n  * Schrems I and Schrems II\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Data Protection\n  * European Union\n\n#### More about\n\n107 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * GDPR\n  * OpenAI\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * GDPR\n  * OpenAI\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * ChatGPT\n  * cookies\n  * Copilot\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Max Schrems\n  * Schrems I and Schrems II\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Data Protection\n  * European Union\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### More big city newspapers drag Microsoft, OpenAI hard in copyright lawsuit\n\nPublishers want ChatGPT models destroyed after ML tech trained 'unlawfully' on\narticles\n\nAI + ML2 days | 15\n\n#### Microsoft's FOMO after seeing Google AI drove investment in OpenAI\n\nHistorical email in antitrust case shows execs 'very, very worried' about\ncapability gaps\n\nAI + ML24 hrs | 1\n\n#### ChatGPT Plus remembers everything you forgot you told it to remember\n\nUnless you live in Europe or Korea\n\nAI + ML2 days | 6\n\n#### Easing the cloud migration journey\n\nHuawei\u2019s Net5.5G converged IP network can improve cloud performance,\nreliability and security, says the company\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Jensen Huang and Sam Altman among tech chiefs invited to federal AI\nSafety Board\n\nStacking the deck \u2013 we've heard of it\n\nAI + ML6 days | 5\n\n#### Watchdog tells Dutch govt: 'Do not use Facebook if there is uncertainty\nabout privacy'\n\nMeta insists it's just misunderstood and it's safe to talk to citizens over FB\n\nSecurity10 days | 9\n\n#### OpenAI launches Asian operations in Tokyo to avoid being lost in\ntranslation\n\nLocal customers get early access to Japanese-language GPT-4\n\nAI + ML16 days | 3\n\n#### How to coax ChatGPT into making better predictions: Get it to tell tales\nfrom the future\n\n'Something is stopping it, even though it clearly can do it'\n\nAI + ML18 days | 16\n\n#### AI gold rush continues as Microsoft invests $1.5B in UAE's G42\n\nCan regulators keep up?\n\nAI + ML16 days | 3\n\n#### OpenAI CEO wants UAE into his plan for a global AI cabal\n\nAsking for emir few billion bucks to pay for lots of fabs, datacenters, and\nnuclear power plants\n\nAI + ML21 days | 7\n\n#### MPs ask: Why is it so freakin' hard to get AI giants to pay copyright\nholders?\n\nAgreement on consent and compensation has failed to materialize\n\nAI + ML21 days | 58\n\n#### OpenAI claims its software can clone your voice from 15 seconds of you\ntalking\n\nSuper lab loves to big up things it says it couldn't possibly let loose on the\nworld for now\n\nAI + ML1 month | 19\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
