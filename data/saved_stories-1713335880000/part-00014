There are really super roadmaps and coursework for\nthose career paths elsewhere (see https://roadmap.sh/ for more info).\n\nThere is a lot to learn in a university Computer Science program, but only\nknowing about 75% is good enough for an interview, so that's what I cover\nhere. For a complete CS self-taught program, the resources for my study plan\nhave been included in Kamran Ahmed's Computer Science Roadmap:\nhttps://roadmap.sh/computer-science\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n### The Study Plan\n\n  * What is it?\n  * Why use it?\n  * How to use it\n  * Don't feel you aren't smart enough\n  * A Note About Video Resources\n  * Choose a Programming Language\n  * Books for Data Structures and Algorithms\n  * Interview Prep Books\n  * Don't Make My Mistakes\n  * What you Won't See Covered\n  * The Daily Plan\n  * Coding Question Practice\n  * Coding Problems\n\n### Topics of Study\n\n  * Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis\n  * Data Structures\n\n    * Arrays\n    * Linked Lists\n    * Stack\n    * Queue\n    * Hash table\n  * More Knowledge\n\n    * Binary search\n    * Bitwise operations\n  * Trees\n\n    * Trees - Intro\n    * Binary search trees: BSTs\n    * Heap / Priority Queue / Binary Heap\n    * balanced search trees (general concept, not details)\n    * traversals: preorder, inorder, postorder, BFS, DFS\n  * Sorting\n\n    * selection\n    * insertion\n    * heapsort\n    * quicksort\n    * mergesort\n  * Graphs\n\n    * directed\n    * undirected\n    * adjacency matrix\n    * adjacency list\n    * traversals: BFS, DFS\n  * Even More Knowledge\n\n    * Recursion\n    * Dynamic Programming\n    * Design Patterns\n    * Combinatorics (n choose k) & Probability\n    * NP, NP-Complete and Approximation Algorithms\n    * How computers process a program\n    * Caches\n    * Processes and Threads\n    * Testing\n    * String searching & manipulations\n    * Tries\n    * Floating Point Numbers\n    * Unicode\n    * Endianness\n    * Networking\n  * Final Review\n\n### Getting the Job\n\n  * Update Your Resume\n  * Find a Job\n  * Interview Process & General Interview Prep\n  * Be thinking of for when the interview comes\n  * Have questions for the interviewer\n  * Once You've Got The Job\n\n\\---------------- Everything below this point is optional ----------------\n\n### Optional Extra Topics & Resources\n\n  * Additional Books\n  * System Design, Scalability, Data Handling (if you have 4+ years experience)\n  * Additional Learning\n\n    * Compilers\n    * Emacs and vi(m)\n    * Unix command line tools\n    * Information theory\n    * Parity & Hamming Code\n    * Entropy\n    * Cryptography\n    * Compression\n    * Computer Security\n    * Garbage collection\n    * Parallel Programming\n    * Messaging, Serialization, and Queueing Systems\n    * A*\n    * Fast Fourier Transform\n    * Bloom Filter\n    * HyperLogLog\n    * Locality-Sensitive Hashing\n    * van Emde Boas Trees\n    * Augmented Data Structures\n    * Balanced search trees\n\n      * AVL trees\n      * Splay trees\n      * Red/black trees\n      * 2-3 search trees\n      * 2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)\n      * N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees\n      * B-Trees\n    * k-D Trees\n    * Skip lists\n    * Network Flows\n    * Disjoint Sets & Union Find\n    * Math for Fast Processing\n    * Treap\n    * Linear Programming\n    * Geometry, Convex hull\n    * Discrete math\n  * Additional Detail on Some Subjects\n  * Video Series\n  * Computer Science Courses\n  * Papers\n\n## Why use it?\n\nIf you want to work as a software engineer for a large company, these are the\nthings you have to know.\n\nIf you missed out on getting a degree in computer science, like I did, this\nwill catch you up and save four years of your life.\n\nWhen I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know\nBig-O anything, or anything about trees, or how to traverse a graph. If I had\nto code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it would have been terrible. Every\ndata structure I had ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know\nhow they worked under the hood at all. I never had to manage memory unless a\nprocess I was running would give an \"out of memory\" error, and then I'd have\nto find a workaround. I used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and\nthousands of associative arrays, but I never created data structures from\nscratch.\n\nIt's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of\nthis already it will take you a lot less time.\n\n## How to use it\n\nEverything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from\ntop to bottom.\n\nI'm using GitHub's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to track\nprogress.\n\n  * More about GitHub-flavored markdown\n\n### If you don't want to use git\n\nOn this page, click the Code button near the top, then click \"Download ZIP\".\nUnzip the file and you can work with the text files.\n\nIf you're open in a code editor that understands markdown, you'll see\neverything formatted nicely.\n\n### If you're comfortable with git\n\nCreate a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the\nbrackets: [x]\n\n  1. Fork the GitHub repo: https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university by clicking on the Fork button.\n\n  2. Clone to your local repo:\n    \n        git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/coding-interview-university.git cd coding-interview-university git remote add upstream https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university.git git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE # so that you don't push your personal progress back to the original repo\n\n  3. Mark all boxes with X after you completed your changes:\n    \n        git commit -am \"Marked personal progress\" git pull upstream main # keep your fork up-to-date with changes from the original repo git push # just pushes to your fork\n\n## Don't feel you aren't smart enough\n\n  * Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough.\n  * The following videos may help you overcome this insecurity:\n\n    * The myth of the Genius Programmer\n    * It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech\n\n## A Note About Video Resources\n\nSome videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. These\nare called MOOCs. Sometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait\na couple of months, so you have no access.\n\nIt would be great to replace the online course resources with free and always-\navailable public sources, such as YouTube videos (preferably university\nlectures), so that you people can study these anytime, not just when a\nspecific online course is in session.\n\n## Choose a Programming Language\n\nYou'll need to choose a programming language for the coding interviews you do,\nbut you'll also need to find a language that you can use to study computer\nscience concepts.\n\nPreferably the language would be the same, so that you only need to be\nproficient in one.\n\n### For this Study Plan\n\nWhen I did the study plan, I used 2 languages for most of it: C and Python\n\n  * C: Very low level. Allows you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures and algorithms in your bones. In higher-level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day-to-day work, that's terrific, but when you're learning how these low-level data structures are built, it's great to feel close to the metal.\n\n    * C is everywhere. You'll see examples in books, lectures, videos, everywhere while you're studying.\n    * The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition\n\n      * This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.\n      * You don't need to go super deep in the book (or even finish it). Just get to where you're comfortable reading and writing in C.\n  * Python: Modern and very expressive, I learned it because it's just super useful and also allows me to write less code in an interview.\n\nThis is my preference. You do what you like, of course.\n\nYou may not need it, but here are some sites for learning a new language:\n\n  * Exercism\n  * Codewars\n  * HackerEarth\n  * Scaler Topics (Java, C++)\n\n### For your Coding Interview\n\nYou can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the\ninterview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:\n\n  * C++\n  * Java\n  * Python\n\nYou could also use these, but read around first. There may be caveats:\n\n  * JavaScript\n  * Ruby\n\nHere is an article I wrote about choosing a language for the interview: Pick\nOne Language for the Coding Interview. This is the original article my post\nwas based on: Choosing a Programming Language for Interviews\n\nYou need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable.\n\nRead more about choices:\n\n  * Choose the Right Language for Your Coding Interview\n\nSee language-specific resources here\n\n## Books for Data Structures and Algorithms\n\nThis book will form your foundation for computer science.\n\nJust choose one, in a language that you will be comfortable with. You'll be\ndoing a lot of reading and coding.\n\n### C\n\n  * Algorithms in C, Parts 1-5 (Bundle), 3rd Edition\n\n    * Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching, and Graph Algorithms\n\n### Python\n\n  * Data Structures and Algorithms in Python\n\n    * by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser\n    * I loved this book. It covered everything and more.\n    * Pythonic code\n    * my glowing book report: https://startupnextdoor.com/book-report-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python/\n\n### Java\n\nYour choice:\n\n  * Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser\n\n    * Data Structures and Algorithms in Java\n  * Sedgewick and Wayne:\n\n    * Algorithms\n    * Free Coursera course that covers the book (taught by the authors!):\n\n      * Algorithms I\n      * Algorithms II\n\n### C++\n\nYour choice:\n\n  * Goodrich, Tamassia, and Mount\n\n    * Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, 2nd Edition\n  * Sedgewick and Wayne\n\n    * Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals, Data Structure, Sorting, Searching\n    * Algorithms in C++ Part 5: Graph Algorithms\n\n## Interview Prep Books\n\nYou don't need to buy a bunch of these. Honestly \"Cracking the Coding\nInterview\" is probably enough, but I bought more to give myself more practice.\nBut I always do too much.\n\nI bought both of these. They gave me plenty of practice.\n\n  * Programming Interviews Exposed: Coding Your Way Through the Interview, 4th Edition\n\n    * Answers in C++ and Java\n    * This is a good warm-up for Cracking the Coding Interview\n    * Not too difficult. Most problems may be easier than what you'll see in an interview (from what I've read)\n  * Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition\n\n    * answers in Java\n\n### If you have tons of extra time:\n\nChoose one:\n\n  * Elements of Programming Interviews (C++ version)\n  * Elements of Programming Interviews in Python\n  * Elements of Programming Interviews (Java version) - Companion Project - Method Stub and Test Cases for Every Problem in the Book\n\n## Don't Make My Mistakes\n\nThis list grew over many months, and yes, it got out of hand.\n\nHere are some mistakes I made so you'll have a better experience. And you'll\nsave months of time.\n\n### 1\\. You Won't Remember it All\n\nI watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was\nmuch I didn't remember. I spent 3 days going through my notes and making\nflashcards, so I could review. I didn't need all of that knowledge.\n\nPlease, read so you won't make my mistakes:\n\nRetaining Computer Science Knowledge.\n\n### 2\\. Use Flashcards\n\nTo solve the problem, I made a little flashcard site where I could add\nflashcards of 2 types: general and code. Each card has a different formatting.\nI made a mobile-first website, so I could review on my phone or tablet,\nwherever I am.\n\nMake your own for free:\n\n  * Flashcards site repo\n\nI DON'T RECOMMEND using my flashcards. There are too many and most of them are\ntrivia that you don't need.\n\nBut if you don't want to listen to me, here you go:\n\n  * My flash cards database (1200 cards):\n  * My flash cards database (extreme - 1800 cards):\n\nKeep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly\nlanguage and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics. It's way too\nmuch for what's required.\n\nNote on flashcards: The first time you recognize you know the answer, don't\nmark it as known. You have to see the same card and answer it several times\ncorrectly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper\nin your brain.\n\nAn alternative to using my flashcard site is Anki, which has been recommended\nto me numerous times. It uses a repetition system to help you remember. It's\nuser-friendly, available on all platforms, and has a cloud sync system. It\ncosts $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms.\n\nMy flashcard database in Anki format: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560\n(thanks @xiewenya).\n\nSome students have mentioned formatting issues with white space that can be\nfixed by doing the following: open the deck, edit the card, click cards,\nselect the \"styling\" radio button, and add the member \"white-space: pre;\" to\nthe card class.\n\n### 3\\. Do Coding Interview Questions While You're Learning\n\nTHIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.\n\nStart doing coding interview questions while you're learning data structures\nand algorithms.\n\nYou need to apply what you're learning to solve problems, or you'll forget. I\nmade this mistake.\n\nOnce you've learned a topic, and feel somewhat comfortable with it, for\nexample, linked lists:\n\n  1. Open one of the coding interview books (or coding problem websites, listed below)\n  2. Do 2 or 3 questions regarding linked lists.\n  3. Move on to the next learning topic.\n  4. Later, go back and do another 2 or 3 linked list problems.\n  5. Do this with each new topic you learn.\n\nKeep doing problems while you're learning all this stuff, not after.\n\nYou're not being hired for knowledge, but how you apply the knowledge.\n\nThere are many resources for this, listed below. Keep going.\n\n### 4\\. Focus\n\nThere are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and\nconcentration are hard. Turn on some music without lyrics and you'll be able\nto focus pretty well.\n\n## What you won't see covered\n\nThese are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan:\n\n  * Javascript\n  * HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies\n  * SQL\n\n## The Daily Plan\n\nThis course goes over a lot of subjects. Each will probably take you a few\ndays, or maybe even a week or more. It depends on your schedule.\n\nEach day, take the next subject in the list, watch some videos about that\nsubject, and then write an implementation of that data structure or algorithm\nin the language you chose for this course.\n\nYou can see my code here:\n\n  * C\n  * C++\n  * Python\n\nYou don't need to memorize every algorithm. You just need to be able to\nunderstand it enough to be able to write your own implementation.\n\n## Coding Question Practice\n\n    \n    \n    Why is this here? I'm not ready to interview.\n\nThen go back and read this.\n\nWhy you need to practice doing programming problems:\n\n  * Problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in\n  * Gathering requirements for the problem\n  * Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview\n  * Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer\n  * Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions (see Big-O below)\n  * Testing your solutions\n\nThere is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem-solving in an\ninterview. You'll get this from the programming interview books, too, but I\nfound this outstanding: Algorithm design canvas\n\nWrite code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample\ninputs. Then type it and test it out on a computer.\n\nIf you don't have a whiteboard at home, pick up a large drawing pad from an\nart store. You can sit on the couch and practice. This is my \"sofa\nwhiteboard\". I added the pen in the photo just for scale. If you use a pen,\nyou'll wish you could erase. Gets messy quickly. I use a pencil and eraser.\n\nCoding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming\nproblems.\n\n## Coding Problems\n\nDon't forget your key coding interview books here.\n\nSolving Problems:\n\n  * How to Find a Solution\n  * How to Dissect a Topcoder Problem Statement\n\nCoding Interview Question Videos:\n\n  * IDeserve (88 videos)\n  * Tushar Roy (5 playlists)\n\n    * Super for walkthroughs of problem solutions\n  * Nick White - LeetCode Solutions (187 Videos)\n\n    * Good explanations of the solution and the code\n    * You can watch several in a short time\n  * FisherCoder - LeetCode Solutions\n\nChallenge/Practice sites:\n\n  * LeetCode\n\n    * My favorite coding problem site. It's worth the subscription money for the 1-2 months you'll likely be preparing.\n    * See Nick White and FisherCoder Videos above for code walk-throughs.\n  * HackerRank\n  * TopCoder\n  * Codeforces\n  * Codility\n  * Geeks for Geeks\n  * AlgoExpert\n\n    * Created by Google engineers, this is also an excellent resource to hone your skills.\n  * Project Euler\n\n    * very math-focused, and not really suited for coding interviews\n\n## Let's Get Started\n\nAlright, enough talk, let's learn!\n\nBut don't forget to do coding problems from above while you learn!\n\n## Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis\n\n  * Nothing to implement here, you're just watching videos and taking notes! Yay!\n  * There are a lot of videos here. Just watch enough until you understand it. You can always come back and review.\n  * Don't worry if you don't understand all the math behind it.\n  * You just need to understand how to express the complexity of an algorithm in terms of Big-O.\n  * Harvard CS50 - Asymptotic Notation (video)\n  * Big O Notations (general quick tutorial) (video)\n  * Big O Notation (and Omega and Theta) - best mathematical explanation (video)\n  * Skiena (video)\n  * UC Berkeley Big O (video)\n  * Amortized Analysis (video)\n  * TopCoder (includes recurrence relations and master theorem):\n\n    * Computational Complexity: Section 1\n    * Computational Complexity: Section 2\n  * Cheat sheet\n  * [Review] Analyzing Algorithms (playlist) in 18 minutes (video)\n\nWell, that's about enough of that.\n\nWhen you go through \"Cracking the Coding Interview\", there is a chapter on\nthis, and at the end there is a quiz to see if you can identify the runtime\ncomplexity of different algorithms. It's a super review and test.\n\n## Data Structures\n\n  * ### Arrays\n\n    * About Arrays:\n\n      * Arrays CS50 Harvard University\n      * Arrays (video)\n      * UC Berkeley CS61B - Linear and Multi-Dim Arrays (video) (Start watching from 15m 32s)\n      * Dynamic Arrays (video)\n      * Jagged Arrays (video)\n    * Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing):\n\n      * Practice coding using arrays and pointers, and pointer math to jump to an index instead of using indexing.\n      * New raw data array with allocated memory\n\n        * can allocate int array under the hood, just not use its features\n        * start with 16, or if the starting number is greater, use power of 2 - 16, 32, 64, 128\n      * size() - number of items\n      * capacity() - number of items it can hold\n      * is_empty()\n      * at(index) - returns the item at a given index, blows up if index out of bounds\n      * push(item)\n      * insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right\n      * prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0\n      * pop() - remove from end, return value\n      * delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left\n      * remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)\n      * find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found\n      * resize(new_capacity) // private function\n\n        * when you reach capacity, resize to double the size\n        * when popping an item, if the size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half\n    * Time\n\n      * O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update\n      * O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere\n    * Space\n\n      * contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance\n      * space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)\n  * ### Linked Lists\n\n    * Description:\n\n      * Linked Lists CS50 Harvard University - this builds the intuition.\n      * Singly Linked Lists (video)\n      * CS 61B - Linked Lists 1 (video)\n      * CS 61B - Linked Lists 2 (video)\n      * [Review] Linked lists in 4 minutes (video)\n    * C Code (video) - not the whole video, just portions about Node struct and memory allocation\n    * Linked List vs Arrays:\n\n      * Core Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)\n      * In The Real World Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)\n    * Why you should avoid linked lists (video)\n    * Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge: (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points) This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.\n\n      * Pointers to Pointers\n    * Implement (I did with tail pointer & without):\n\n      * size() - returns the number of data elements in the list\n      * empty() - bool returns true if empty\n      * value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)\n      * push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list\n      * pop_front() - remove the front item and return its value\n      * push_back(value) - adds an item at the end\n      * pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value\n      * front() - get the value of the front item\n      * back() - get the value of the end item\n      * insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so the current item at that index is pointed to by the new item at the index\n      * erase(index) - removes node at given index\n      * value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at the nth position from the end of the list\n      * reverse() - reverses the list\n      * remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value\n    * Doubly-linked List\n\n      * Description (video)\n      * No need to implement\n  * ### Stack\n\n    * Stacks (video)\n    * [Review] Stacks in 3 minutes (video)\n    * Will not implement.

A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations to move any accessed key to the root.\" - Skiena\n\n    * Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code\n\n      * Splay tree: insert, search, delete functions If you end up implementing a red/black tree try just these:\n      * Search and insertion functions, skipping delete\n    * I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets\n\n    * Self-balancing binary search tree\n\n    * AVL trees\n\n      * In practice: From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be: The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly balanced than red\u2013black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter)\n      * MIT AVL Trees / AVL Sort (video)\n      * AVL Trees (video)\n      * AVL Tree Implementation (video)\n      * Split And Merge\n      * [Review] AVL Trees (playlist) in 19 minutes (video)\n    * Splay trees\n\n      * In practice: Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors, data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory, networking and file system code) etc\n      * CS 61B: Splay Trees (video)\n      * MIT Lecture: Splay Trees:\n\n        * Gets very mathy, but watch the last 10 minutes for sure.\n        * Video\n    * Red/black trees\n\n      * These are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below).\n      * In practice: Red\u2013black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time. Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures that provide worst-case guarantees; for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red-black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red\u2013black trees. In version 8 of Java, the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used\n      * Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 4 (link jumps to the starting point) (video)\n      * Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 5 (video)\n      * Red-Black Tree\n      * An Introduction To Binary Search And Red Black Tree\n      * [Review] Red-Black Trees (playlist) in 30 minutes (video)\n    * 2-3 search trees\n\n      * In practice: 2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).\n      * You would use 2-3 trees very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red-Black trees.\n      * 23-Tree Intuition and Definition (video)\n      * Binary View of 23-Tree\n      * 2-3 Trees (student recitation) (video)\n    * 2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)\n\n      * In practice: For every 2-4 trees, there are corresponding red\u2013black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red\u2013black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an important tool for understanding the logic behind red-black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce 2-4 trees just before red\u2013black trees, even though 2-4 trees are not often used in practice.\n      * CS 61B Lecture 26: Balanced Search Trees (video)\n      * Bottom Up 234-Trees (video)\n      * Top Down 234-Trees (video)\n    * N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees\n\n      * note: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)\n      * binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2\n      * 2-3 trees are 3-ary\n      * K-Ary Tree\n    * B-Trees\n\n      * Fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor).\n      * In Practice: B-trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block address into a disk block (or perhaps to a cylinder head sector) address\n      * B-Tree\n      * B-Tree Datastructure\n      * Introduction to B-Trees (video)\n      * B-Tree Definition and Insertion (video)\n      * B-Tree Deletion (video)\n      * MIT 6.851 - Memory Hierarchy Models (video) - covers cache-oblivious B-Trees, very interesting data structures - the first 37 minutes are very technical, and may be skipped (B is block size, cache line size)\n      * [Review] B-Trees (playlist) in 26 minutes (video)\n  * ### k-D Trees\n\n    * Great for finding a number of points in a rectangle or higher-dimensional object\n    * A good fit for k-nearest neighbors\n    * kNN K-d tree algorithm (video)\n  * ### Skip lists\n\n    * \"These are somewhat of a cult data structure\" - Skiena\n    * Randomization: Skip Lists (video)\n    * For animations and a little more detail\n  * ### Network Flows\n\n    * Ford-Fulkerson in 5 minutes \u2014 Step by step example (video)\n    * Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (video)\n    * Network Flows (video)\n  * ### Disjoint Sets & Union Find\n\n    * UCB 61B - Disjoint Sets; Sorting & selection (video)\n    * Sedgewick Algorithms - Union-Find (6 videos)\n  * ### Math for Fast Processing\n\n    * Integer Arithmetic, Karatsuba Multiplication (video)\n    * The Chinese Remainder Theorem (used in cryptography) (video)\n  * ### Treap\n\n    * Combination of a binary search tree and a heap\n    * Treap\n    * Data Structures: Treaps explained (video)\n    * Applications in set operations\n  * ### Linear Programming (videos)\n\n    * Linear Programming\n    * Finding minimum cost\n    * Finding maximum value\n    * Solve Linear Equations with Python - Simplex Algorithm\n  * ### Geometry, Convex hull (videos)\n\n    * Graph Alg.
