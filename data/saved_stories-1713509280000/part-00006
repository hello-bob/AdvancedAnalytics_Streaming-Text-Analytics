Governments,\nmedia organisations and educational institutions have long been the\ncontrollers of information, but nowadays the biggest controller of all is\ntechnology companies. These entities work together far more than most realise.\nThe revolving door is no doubt doing its thing, and not just in the USA.\n\nThe power over information always mattered of course, but in 2024 with 64\ncountries heading to the polls, there is a lot at stake. It is quite\nremarkable therefore, how little is mentioned about the influence that search\nengines have on elections. Even more remarkable when Google has over 90% of\nglobal market share.\n\n## The Influence of Search\n\nActually the influence of search engines on elections has been commented on\nsince the early 2000s. Books may have been written, and yet little academic\nresearch seems to have been done. It may seem remarkable, unless you think\nabout it.\n\nAn exception is Robert Epstein, a researcher now outside the academic\nmainstream, who has been publishing about the effects of search on elections\nsince 2015, based on very extensive data collection. His paper from back then\n\u201cThe search engine manipulation effect (SEME) and its possible impact on the\noutcomes of elections\u201d concluded that:\n\n  * biased search rankings can shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20% or more,\n  * the shift can be to 80% in some demographic groups, and\n  * such rankings can be masked so that people show no awareness of the manipulation.\n\nEpstein also wrote in 2015: \u201cResearch I have been directing in recent years\nsuggests that Google, Inc., has amassed far more power to control\nelections\u2014indeed, to control a wide variety of opinions and beliefs\u2014than any\ncompany in history has ever had.\u201d Indeed so.\n\nPredictably his research has been labelled a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d by Google.\nUndeterred Epstein continues his research today and has made testimony to\nCongress.\n\n## From Media to Digital\n\nIt can\u2019t be news to anyone that the mainstream media has had, and still has,\nan enormous influence on elections. To cite two examples: in \"News: The\nPolitics of Illusion\", Lance Bennett gave a critical examination of the news\nmedia's role in American democracy, arguing that the news media act as a\nfilter that shapes and distorts the political reality that reaches the\naudience. And in \"Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass\nMedia,\" Herman and Chomsky detail an international \"propaganda model\" and\nargue that mass media serve the interests of elite groups, affecting\neverything from public discourse to election results. As they point out:\n\n> \u201cthe mass media are drawn into a symbiotic relationship with powerful\n> sources of information by economic necessity and reciprocity of interest.\u201d\n\nWell we all know this, if and when we stop to think about it.\n\nManufacturing Consent first published in 1988, one year before the invention\nof the Web, does not cover the influence of digital platforms today. But the\nextension of this model into the digital age, was covered by Robert\nMcChesney's book \"Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism is Turning the Internet\nAgainst Democracy\" in 2013. McChesney argues that the Internet, initially\ncelebrated as a tool that would enhance democracy by enabling free\ncommunication and access to information, has instead been co-opted by\ncorporate and capitalist forces.\n\nIt is interesting to note that behaviours for accessing news varies on the\nWeb, varies very significantly across different countries, according to\nresearch undertaken in 2019 by the Reuters Institute. To illustrate this shown\nbelow are the answers to the question: \u201cWhich of these was the MAIN way in\nwhich you came across news in the last week?\u201d where the study noted that there\nwas a pattern of four types of behaviour:\n\n## Scapegoats 2024?\n\nYou can bet that the post-election analyses of votes this year will have all\nmanner of theories about who is to blame for outcomes. Social media will get a\nbashing again, no doubt. In the US, much of the recent news has been about the\ninfluence of TikTok. And the influence of Facebook has regularly been\ndiscussed and battled over in elections across the world, in the last 8 years\nat least.\n\nWe can expect much to be written about deep fakes. AI is already coming under\nscrutiny and we can expect a lot more. Disinformation will be an overused\nword, drowning out mention of that other word, propaganda.\n\nWill search engines get a mention? Will the influence of Google on elections\nget a mention in the mainstream news? Don\u2019t hold your breath. Anyway, what do\nyou think Mojeek?.\n\ncolin\n\n18 April 2024\n\n2 min\n\n  * Search\n  * Values\n\n## Get the latest\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter and receive Mojeek news and articles by email.\n\nSubscribe\n\n  * All posts\n  * Archive\n\n  * Mojeek\n  * About\n  * Privacy\n\n", "frontpage": true}
