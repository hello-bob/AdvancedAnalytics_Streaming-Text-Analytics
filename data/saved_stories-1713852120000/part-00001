Departing from the typical frenzy of\njumping and strafing, it champions style and precision, drawing inspiration\nfrom the gritty intensity of the works of John Woo and the Hong Kong Blood\nOperas.In this vision, the emphasis is on how you kill, not just how many. If\nyou've ever wanted to dive over the counter of a bar, twin Berettas in hand,\nif you've dreamt about somersaulting over your enemies head, before blowing\nthem away with your shotgun, if you've longed for the ability to back-flip of\nwalls and kick people through a plate-glass window, you should care.This TC is\nfor people who prefer brains to brawn. Style to endless amounts of lead. Not\njust getting another frag, but looking good while you do it.\n\n  * Mods/\n    * Action.zip (link)\n    * The-Opera.zip (link)\n  * Servers/\n    * Action Half-Life (Last Man Standing)(IP)\n    * Action Half-Life (Teamplay w/ rounds) (IP)\n    * The Opera(Deathmatch) (IP)\n    * The Opera(Dueling Berettas) (IP)\n    * The Opera(2 player & 3 player Last Man Standing) (IP)\n    * The Opera(Mookmatch) (IP)\n\nDueling Berettas:| ~  \n---  \n  \nGo back\n\n", "frontpage": false}
