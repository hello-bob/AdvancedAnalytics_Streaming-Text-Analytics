Since 2003\n\n# ARD/ZDF plan joint open-source streaming OS\n\nMay 6, 2024 08.52 Europe/London By J\u00f6rn Krieger\n\nGerman public broadcasters ARD and ZDF want to put their streaming services on\na uniform technical basis through a joint operating system (OS).\n\nThe plan will be realised through the creation of an open-source initiative\nand a joint subsidiary operating their streaming services. The move marks the\nnext step in an approach by ARD and ZDF to collaborate more closely in the\nstreaming area.\n\n\u201cWe are pooling our strengths as much as possible, jointly creating a service\nthat combines journalistic quality, editorial diversity and public service\nvalues. In this way, we are jointly positioning ourselves against the\ncommercial big tech players as a value-based, transparent streaming provider\ncommitted to German society,\u201d said ARD Chairman Kai Gniffke.\n\nThe technical components of the streaming OS are to be developed and used\njointly. This applies, for example, to the player, the recommendation system\nand the design system. There will also be close cooperation between ARD and\nZDF on comprehensive personalisation and the mutual exchange of data, for\nexample to improve the cross-offer user experience.\n\nZDF Director General Dr Norbert Himmler added: \u201cWith one of the largest open-\nsource initiatives in Germany, we are making premium technology available to\neveryone. We are also increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the\ndevelopment and operation of the streaming services. To this end, we are\ncooperating closely with ARD and taking a major step in our transparency\noffensive.\u201d\n\nParts of ARD and ZDF\u2019s streaming OS are to be made available to the general\npublic to enable active participation. For example, cultural institutions as\nwell as platform providers in Germany and abroad will be able to use the\nexpertise and technology of the two public broadcasters.\n\nARD and ZDF are setting up a joint office for their streaming OS. This office\nwill manage the tasks and resources of both organisations and represent the\nproject externally, for example to potential partners. ZDF will be in charge\nof this. A joint subsidiary is to be founded for technical operations,\nhandling the IP distribution of the streaming services and administration. ARD\nwill take the lead for this unit.\n\nThe exact structure of the two institutions will be worked out in the coming\nmonths. A legal basis is also required for joint ventures. The aim is to set\nup the units in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIn contrast to commercial platforms, there will be a recommendation system for\nregistered users based on transparent public service algorithms as well as\ncareful and prudent handling of data, the broadcasters stress in a joint\nstatement. In conjunction with intelligent dialogue solutions, new ways of\nparticipation are also to be opened up. ARD and ZDF see themselves as\n\u201cenablers\u201d for the market and society. With the streaming OS, cultural\ninstitutions, but also smaller commercial players, have the opportunity to\nbuild or further develop their own platforms more easily than before,\naccording to the broadcasters.\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\n#### ARD and ZDF offering joint recommendations\n\nARD and ZDF\u2019s streaming services are now offering recommendation from key\ngenres across each other\u2019s content.
