Even when\neverything is as carefully organized as can be things start to break down as\nthese groups grow:\n\n  * With five conversations going on at the same time you\u2019re not quite sure anymore who\u2019s talking with whom\u2014it\u2019s impossible to keep track of.\n  * You want to talk about this one topic somebody mentioned five hours ago but the message is now 15 pages up and nobody knows what you\u2019re talking about anymore. Don\u2019t even get me started on topics from days or even, gasp, weeks ago!\n  * This is amplified by the fact that searching and linking to old messages is often a pain. Many times valuable and interesting conversations are lost forever, or the knowledge is trapped in the tool itself, never to be discovered from the outside.\n\nBased on my own experience, and all those groups I have approached, we\napproached the problem hands-on and built Spek diffently, tailor made for the\npurpse:\n\n  * All conversations in communities which are public are search engine indexable which makes it so all the valuable information is not lost behind the walls of the platform but accessible to the whole internet to use.\n\n  * Every conversation on Spek starts as a thread, its own place to provide rich context for the conversation ahead. Once a thread is published others can join the conversation.\n\n  * Conversations in threads are modeled after real-time chat applications. It feels more present than a static list of threaded comments, and when multiple people are online talking at the same time it feels like any other chat app you know.\n\n  * Because Spek is a platform, you are able to join all of your favorite communities with one profile, one login, one set of notifications and direct messages.\n\n  * By having all of your communities in one place, you get a single feed of all the things that you\u2019re interested in, sorted by where the most active conversations are taking place right now.\n\n### Contributing\n\nI've have been working on this project since mid-march but I don't work on the\nproject full-time yet and I been mainly implementing the core functionality\nfor the whole platform and the next step for the project is now to start doing\na redesign because currently the UI does not tell you immediately that this is\na billion dollar idea. so if you are a designer or a developer the project is\n- Open source. so join me in this journey of transforming public communities\nfor developers\n\n\ud83d\udcbb\n\nThe backend is written in Elixir and PostgresQL for the database and for the\nfrontend it's obviously Nextjs because you know Nextjs is the king and React\nis the kingdom \ud83d\ude01\n\n", "frontpage": false}
