SmallBASIC includes\ntrigonometric, matrices and algebra functions, a built in IDE, a powerful\nstring library, system, sound, graphic commands and communication via serial\nor sockets along with structured programming syntax.\n\n    \n    \n    ' Example for using functions in SmallBASIC s = AddStrings(\"My\", \"String\") print s func AddStrings(a, b) return a + b end\n\n## Programming Made Easy for All\n\nSmallBASIC is available for various operating systems, including Windows,\nLinux, and Android. You can even build it from source to run on many other\nPOSIX-compliant systems, such as Raspberry Pi OS for the Raspberry Pi. With\nits built-in Integrated Development Environment (IDE), you can write programs\non your Android-powered tablet or mobile phone and run them instantly. If you\nwant to get started, you can download SmallBASIC from our (Downloads) page.\n\nSmallBASIC makes it easy to bundle your program with all the necessary\nlibraries, creating executable files for Windows (exe-files) or Linux\n(AppImage). For Android, you can create a signed package (pkg) and distribute\nit through platforms like Google Play. Learn more about distributing your\nprogram on our (Distribution) page.\n\nIf you prefer an online experience, you can start programming with the web-\nbased version of SmallBASIC in your browser right now. Just click on Start\nonline to begin coding.\n\n## Editors, IDE and SmallBASIC versions\n\nSmallBASIC comes in three different flavors for the desktop. The SDL version\noffers a simple but efficient IDE and is perfect for working with graphics.\nThe FLTK version has a great IDE. The console version doesn\u2019t offer an IDE and\nis text-only but works perfect with plugins like raylib or nuklear\n(Downloads).\n\nNo matter which SmallBASIC version you prefer, external editors like Visual\nStudio Code, Geany, Sublime Text or KDE Kate can be setup for syntax\nhighlighting or code execution (Setup external editors).\n\nInstructions on how to use the editor in the SDL and Android version can be\nfound in the article Android\n\n## Units\n\nUnits are sets of functions, procedures and constants bundled in a BASIC-\nlibrary and can be imported in your program. Units use their own namespace and\ntherefore are separated from your program.\n\n    \n    \n    ' Example for importing the CSS color-name unit Import crgb as c Color c.Black, c.Tomato Print \" Standard CSS Tomato background color \" Color c.Black, c.LightSteelBlue Print \" Standard CSS LightSteelBlue background color \" rect 200, 200, 400, 400 COLOR c.DeepPink filled\n\n## Plugins\n\nPlugins are libraries written in C which extent the functionality of\nSmallBASIC. SmallBASIC offers an API to write your own plugins. The following\nplugins are part of the release version of SmallBASIC: raylib (2D and 3D game\ndevelopment), nuklear (GUI programming), clipboard, gifencoder and WebSockets.\nYou can also import a plugin for the Raspberry Pi to use the GPIO ports and\nsome additional hardware like displays or temperature sensors.\n\n    \n    \n    ' Example how to use raylib to open a window and print text. import raylib as rl import raylibc as c const screenWidth = 800 const screenHeight = 450 rl.InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, \"raylib [core] example - basic window\") rl.SetTargetFPS(60) while (!rl.WindowShouldClose()) rl.BeginDrawing() rl.ClearBackground(c.RAYWHITE) rl.DrawText(\"Congrats! You created your first window!\", 190, 200, 20, c.LIGHTGRAY) rl.EndDrawing() wend rl.CloseWindow()\n\n## More information\n\nRead more in the short user guide or in the SmallBASIC handbook.
