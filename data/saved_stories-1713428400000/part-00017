Humane raised nearly $250m in funding to develop it.\n\nIt does not have a screen but can project images onto the hand of the wearer\nand comes with some basic gesture control.\n\nIt does have a phone number but it cannot sync with an existing smartphone and\nit has no bespoke apps.\n\nReviewers said the pin's laser ink display projections, demonstrated above at\nthe Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, were less visible in bright\nlight.\n\nThose who have got their hands on the device have been wince-inducingly\ncritical of it.\n\n  * What is AI, how does it work and what can it be used for?\n\nDavid Pierce, writing on tech site The Verge, said: \u201cAfter many days of\ntesting, the one and only thing I can truly rely on the AI Pin to do is tell\nme the time\u201d.\n\nSeveral reviewers mentioned seemingly poor battery life requiring multiple\ncharges throughout the day.\n\nJoanna Stern from the Wall Street Journal was among those who said she could\nfeel the pin getting hot as she was wearing it.\n\nHumane has not responded to the BBC's request for comment but Sam Sheffer,\nhead of new media at Humane, accepted on X (formerly Twitter) that the\nsoftware \u201cwas not where it needs to be\u201d.\n\n\u201cFeedback is a gift. we reflect and we listen and we learn and we continue\nbuilding,\u201d he wrote in response to Mr Brownlee\u2019s review.\n\nThe Pin is being so closely watched in case it offer answers to two of the\nmost burning questions in tech: can any device truly challenge the smartphone,\nand will the AI revolution create a new generation of hardware?\n\nFrancisco Jeronimo, analyst at market research firm IDC, told the BBC the Pin\nwas \u201ca very interesting device\" but \"makes no sense\u201d from the end user\nperspective.\n\nHe said he feared that might also be the case for similarly hyped AI gadgets,\nsuch as the Rabbit R1 assistant.\n\nHe said while these devices hinted at what intelligent products could offer us\nin the future, they had not delivered it yet.\n\nHumane, which laid off staff at the start of the year, says further updates\nwill be made to the device in the summer.\n\nWriting on X, Humane co-founder Bethany Bongiorno acknowledged that there was\na lot of hard work to do, but was adamant her firm would not be daunted by the\nunfavourable press.\n\n\"If you're a builder - don't stop, don't give up - keep going,\" she wrote.\n\nRead more\n\n## Regulator fears big tech firms' power in AI market\n\n## Google using AI to create search answers in UK trial\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nRelated\n\n## 'AI helps me to make wine for younger drinkers'\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## Can AI take teaching 'out of the Victorian ages'?\n\n20 hrs ago\n\nEngland\n\n## Creating sexually explicit deepfakes to be offence\n\n2 days ago\n\nUK\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
