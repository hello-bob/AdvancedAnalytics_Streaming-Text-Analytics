That leaves today, April\n16, as my last chance to mark a tin anniversary: ten years ago Stratechery\nadded a subscription option, making this my full-time job.\n\nIt was, for the record, a miserable day: I had a convoluted plan to offer\ndifferent site experiences for subscribers and non-subscribers: the former\nwould receive daily linked-list updates (a la Daring Fireball) while the\nlatter would still have access to longer-form Articles; I scrapped the concept\ntwo days later in favor of simply sending subscribers a daily email, and so\nthe paid newsletter model was born.\n\nThat accident of history ended up being why this anniversary is actually more\nmeaningful to me: while I am most well-known for Stratechery, I am equally\nproud of the paid newsletter model \u2014 services like Substack were based on\nStratechery \u2014 and gratified that so many writers are making a living\nconnecting directly with readers.\n\nOf course newsletters aren\u2019t the only medium where this happens (and, in fact,\nI\u2019ve never viewed Stratechery as a newsletter; it\u2019s a blog that you can read\nvia email); there are also podcasts (which Stratechery has expanded into) and\nYouTube (like and subscribe to the Stratechery and Sharp Tech channels!). The\nking of the latter, at least when it comes to tech, is Marques Brownlee, aka\nMKBHD.\n\n### The Humane AI Pin\n\nHumane introduced the wearable AI Pin at a TED Talk 11 months ago, painting\nthe vision of a future without screens, powered by AI. I was, for the record,\npretty skeptical: most new tech categories layer on top of what came before,\nas opposed to outright replacing them; Humane\u2019s proposal of a wearable device\nthat was completely independent of the phone in your pocket seemed unlikely to\nsucceed. Still, I was cheering for them: I applaud any company trying to build\nsomething new, and AI provides the opening for new experimentation.\n\nUnfortunately, last week the reviews of the AI Pin came out and they were\nuniversally terrible; The Verge\u2019s headline summed up the sentiment: Humane AI\nPin review: not even close. David Pierce wrote:\n\n> I came into this review with two big questions about the AI Pin. The first\n> is the big-picture one: is this thing... anything? In just shy of two weeks\n> of testing, I\u2019ve come to realize that there are, in fact, a lot of things\n> for which my phone actually sucks. Often, all I want to do is check the time\n> or write something down or text my wife, and I end up sucked in by TikTok or\n> my email or whatever unwanted notification is sitting there on my screen.\n> Plus, have you ever thought about how often your hands are occupied with\n> groceries / clothes / leashes / children / steering wheels, and how annoying\n> / unsafe it is to try to balance your phone at the same time? I\u2019ve learned I\n> do lots of things on my phone that I might like to do somewhere else. So,\n> yeah, this is something. Maybe something big. AI models aren\u2019t good enough\n> to handle everything yet, but I\u2019ve seen enough glimmers of what\u2019s coming\n> that I\u2019m optimistic about the future.\n>\n> That raises the second question: should you buy this thing? That one\u2019s easy.\n> Nope. Nuh-uh. No way. The AI Pin is an interesting idea that is so\n> thoroughly unfinished and so totally broken in so many unacceptable ways\n> that I can\u2019t think of anyone to whom I\u2019d recommend spending the $699 for the\n> device and the $24 monthly subscription.\n\nBrownlee agreed; he said at the start of his YouTube review:\n\n> So this is the Humane AI Pin. It is a brand new product in a really\n> interesting new form factor of an ultra-futuristic wearable computer. In a\n> time of all these crazy gadgets and Vision Pro and wearable glasses, it\u2019s so\n> sick that we get so many genuinely new first generation products like this\n> to give a shot.\n>\n> Unfortunately it\u2019s also the new worst product I think I\u2019ve ever reviewed in\n> its current state. There\u2019s just so many things bad about it. It\u2019s so bad, in\n> fact, that I actually think it\u2019s kind of distracting to understand what the\n> point of the device is as we go through it, so I\u2019m going to have to separate\n> it out for this video. First, I\u2019m going to tell you what it is and what it\u2019s\n> supposed to do, and then I\u2019ll tell you what my experience has actually been\n> using it.\n\nBrownlee proceeded to do just that: he presented Humane\u2019s vision, detailed how\npoorly it lived up to it (including the probably fatal flaw inherent in its\ndecision to pretend smartphones don\u2019t exist), and granted that future software\nupdates might improve the experience. I thought it was a fair,\n\n^1 if brutal, review, but what had some people up in arms was the title and\nthumbnail:\n\n> I find it distasteful, almost unethical, to say this when you have 18\n> million subscribers.\n>\n> Hard to explain why, but with great reach comes great responsibility.\n> Potentially killing someone else\u2019s nascent project reeks of carelessness.\n>\n> First, do no harm. pic.twitter.com/xFft3u2LYG\n>\n> \u2014 Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) April 15, 2024\n\nI don\u2019t tweet much these days \u2014 if you want one of my tips for lasting over a\ndecade, that is one of them, for my own peace of mind more than anything \u2014 but\nVassallo\u2019s sentiment bothered me enough to fire off a response:\n\n> Marques\u2019 reach is a function of telling the truth. He didn\u2019t always have 18\n> million subscribers, but he had his integrity from the beginning. Expecting\n> him to abandon that is the only thing that is \u201cdistasteful, almost\n> unethical\u201d. https://t.co/UysMnuIctS\n>\n> \u2014 Ben Thompson (@benthompson) April 15, 2024\n\nI honestly think I had this anniversary on my mind: I remember when I first\nstarted, with only a few hundred followers on Twitter, armed with nothing but\nmy honest takes about tech; my only hope was that those takes would be\noriginal enough and valuable enough to build an audience. That they were\ndidn\u2019t diminish the desire to be honest; indeed, one of the biggest challenges\ncreators face as they grow is retaining their edge even when they know people\nare actually paying attention to what they have to say.\n\n### MKBHD\u2019s Responsibility\n\nThe more interesting Vassallo tweet, though, and the one that inspired this\nArticle, was this exchange in response to his original tweet:\n\n> MKBHD is not the market. He *significantly* influences the market.\n>\n> If a single person can affect the stock price of a company, we usually\n> restrict what they can say or when. MK should be cognizant of the\n> unconstrained power he has (for now).\n>\n> \u2014 Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) April 15, 2024\n\nIgnore the vaguely threatening \u201cfor now\u201d ; Vassallo is touching on something\nprofound about Brownlee, that I myself understand intimately: what the\nInternet has made uniquely possible is total loyalty to your customers, and\nthat is threatening.\n\nLet me start with myself: every dollar of income I have comes from my\nsubscribers,\n\n^2 all of whom pay the same price.\n\n^3 If someone doesn\u2019t like what I write, I make it easy to unsubscribe; if\nthey accuse me of writing for favor or illegitimate profit I am happy to\nunsubscribe them myself, and refund their money. After all, to use Brownlee\u2019s\nreponse to Vassallo:\n\n> We disagree on what my job is\n>\n> \u2014 Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) April 15, 2024\n\nMy job is to make my subscribers happy, and the best way I\u2019ve found to do that\nis to stay as true as I can to what I set out to do in the beginning: write\nthings that are original and valuable. When I succeed I\u2019m happy, and the\nnumbers take care of themselves; when I publish something I\u2019m not happy with,\nI have trouble sleeping. When tech companies or investors or anyone else is\nmad, I am free to not pay them any attention.\n\nBrownlee, though, is, to Vassallo\u2019s point, something else entirely: 18 million\nsubscribers is an incredible number, even if only \u2014 \u201conly\u201d \u2014 3.5 million\npeople have viewed his Humane video. If Humane\u2019s AI Pin wasn\u2019t already dead in\nthe water, it\u2019s fair to say that @levelsio is right:\n\n> MKBHD just delivered the final blow to the Humane pin\n> pic.twitter.com/cW9CnRkdPF\n>\n> \u2014 @levelsio (@levelsio) April 15, 2024\n\nWho, though, is to blame, and who benefited? Surely the responsibility for the\nHumane AI Pin lies with Humane; the people who benefited from Brownlee\u2019s\nhonesty were his viewers, the only people to whom Brownlee owes anything. To\nthink of this review \u2014 or even just the title \u2014 as \u201cdistasteful\u201d or\n\u201cunethical\u201d is to view Humane \u2014 a recognizable entity, to be sure \u2014 as of more\nworth than the 3.5 million individuals who watched Brownlee\u2019s review.\n\nThis is one of the challenges of scale: Brownlee has so many viewers that it\nis almost easier to pretend like they are some unimportant blob. Brownlee,\nthough, is successful because he remembers his job is not to go easy on\nindividual companies, but inform individual viewers who will make individual\ndecisions about spending $700 on a product that doesn\u2019t work. Thanks to the\nInternet he has absolutely no responsibility or incentive to do anything but.\n\n### Media and the Internet\n\nWhile Stratechery mostly covers tech, I also spend a lot of time on media; in\nthe early days of Stratechery, this mostly meant newspapers, and my argument\nwas that was in fact a particularly useful angle on the impact of technology\nbroadly: the fact that newspapers were text meant that they felt the impact of\nthe Internet almost immediately, effects that would, as devices became more\npowerful and ubiquitous, and broadband faster and more reliable, impact\neverything. And, of course, Stratechery was a written product, so I had a\nstake in the game.\n\nTo that end, I wrote a series of Articles in the run-up to April 16, 2014,\nlaying the groundwork for why I thought my subscription offering would work.\nThe last of these was entitled Newspapers Are Dead; Long Live Journalism,\nwhere I wrote:\n\n> Remember how the New York Times was started as a means of making money?\n> After the first year the paper had a circulation of 26,000 in a city of over\n> half a million, but had incurred up-front capital costs of $50,000, and\n> first-year expenses of $78,000 (In 1851 dollars; the modern equivalent would\n> be $1.4 million and $2.2 million respectively). Compare that to this blog\n> (which, by happy coincidence, turns one year old tomorrow, making this\n> comparison timely): FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average, the first\n> article in this series, has been read by over 30,000 people; meanwhile, I\u2019ve\n> spent less than $2,000. More readers, way less money.\n>\n> You may consider the comparison unfair \u2014 an entire newsroom putting out a\n> daily edition as compared to a solo blogger posting one Article \u2014 but the\n> unfairness is the point. No one shared my article because it was from\n> Stratechery, but then again, no one shares an article today just because\n> it\u2019s from the New York Times; all that matters is the individual article and\n> its worth to the reader and potential sharer. As a writer, this is amazing.\n> When it comes to reader attention, I am competing on an equal footing with\n> The New York Freaking Times! Unfortunately for The New York Times, when it\n> comes to making money they\u2019re competing with Google and Facebook. Most\n> distressingly, though, when it comes to costs, they\u2019re competing with the\n> last 150 years. Everything from printing presses to sales and marketing is\n> deadweight if advertising is not a sustainable model.\n\nThe New York Times has, to its immense credit, figured out how to go direct to\nreaders; most other newspapers have struggled: cost structures that were\npredicated on owning printing presses and delivery trucks simply don\u2019t make\nsense in a world where distribution is free.\n\nFree distribution, meanwhile, made Stratechery possible: I just needed to\nwrite compelling content on my own website. Brownlee, meanwhile, got his free\ndistribution from YouTube (and, to the extent you want to complain about his\naccurate but attention-grabbing headline, the realities of the YouTube\nalgorithm, the one non-viewer incentive Brownlee needs to respond to, looms\nlarge). The key point is that he could do everything else on his own, starting\nwith the webcam on his HP Pavilion laptop that he used to record his first\nvideo:\n\nToday Brownlee has a top-of-the-line studio and a staff, but the fundamental\nprinciple remains: in media one person can do it all, and build a thriving\nbusiness that makes everyone from Humane to Apple care deeply about what he or\nshe has to say \u2014 far more than they care about any traditional publication.\n\n### AI and Intelligence\n\nI mentioned at the beginning that last year I wrote about ChatGPT Gets a\nComputer in lieu of an anniversary post; that Article, which was built around\nOpenAI\u2019s announcement of (now-discontinued) ChatGPT plugins, was about the\nnature of the brain and how large learning models did or did not compare.\n\n> Computers are deterministic: if circuit X is open, then the proposition\n> represented by X is true; 1 plus 1 is always 2; clicking \u201cback\u201d on your\n> browser will exit this page. There are, of course, a huge number of\n> abstractions and massive amounts of logic between an individual transistor\n> and any action we might take with a computer \u2014 and an effectively infinite\n> number of places for bugs \u2014 but the appropriate mental model for a computer\n> is that they do exactly what they are told (indeed, a bug is not the\n> computer making a mistake, but rather a manifestation of the programmer\n> telling the computer to do the wrong thing).\n>\n> I\u2019ve already mentioned Bing Chat and ChatGPT; on March 14 Anthropic released\n> another AI assistant named Claude: while the announcement doesn\u2019t say so\n> explicitly, I assume the name is in honor of the aforementioned Claude\n> Shannon. This is certainly a noble sentiment \u2014 Shannon\u2019s contributions to\n> information theory broadly extend far beyond what Dixon laid out above \u2014 but\n> it also feels misplaced: while technically speaking everything an AI\n> assistant is doing is ultimately composed of 1s and 0s, the manner in which\n> they operate is emergent from their training, not proscribed, which leads to\n> the experience feeling fundamentally different from logical computers \u2014\n> something nearly human \u2014 which takes us back to hallucinations; Sydney was\n> interesting, but what about homework?\n\nI added in an August Update:\n\n> The point of that Article was that ChatGPT\u2019s plugin architecture gave\n> hallucinating creative LLMs access to determinative computers to ascertain\n> truth, not dissimilar to the way a creative being like you or I might use a\n> calculator to solve a math problem. In other words, the LLM is the interface\n> to the source of truth, not the source of truth itself.\n>\n> That is exactly what this \u201ccoming soon\u201d feature is all about: you don\u2019t make\n> an LLM useful for your business by adding your business\u2019s data to the LLM;\n> that is simply a bit more text in a sea of it. Rather, you leverage the LLM\n> as an interface to \u201ccomputers\u201d that deterministically give you the right\n> answer. In this case, those computers will be \u201cconnecting the applications\n> you already have\u201d, which sounds to me an awful lot like enterprise-specific\n> plug-ins.\n\nThe specifics of product implementations are not the point, but rather the\ndistinction between a natural language interface based on probabilities and\ncomputers based on deterministic calculations; I think using the former to\naccess the latter will remain one of the most important applications of large\nlanguage models.\n\nThere is, though, one more piece: who actually tells the AI what to do, such\nthat it needs access to a computer of its own? In ChatGPT Gets a Computer,\nwhich analogized large language models to Jeff Hawkin\u2019s theory of the brain, I\nexpressed hope that the beliefs he expressed about the nature of intelligence\nin A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence extended to large language\nmodels. Hawkins writes:\n\n> Intelligence is the ability of a system to learn a model of the world.\n> However, the resulting model by itself is valueless, emotionless, and has no\n> goals. Goals and values are provided by whatever system is using the model.\n> It\u2019s similar to how the explorers of the sixteenth through the twentieth\n> centuries worked to create an accurate map of Earth. A ruthless military\n> general might use the map to plan the best way to surround and murder an\n> opposing army. A trader could use the exact same map to peacefully exchange\n> goods. The map itself does not dictate these uses, nor does it impart any\n> value to how it is used. It is just a map, neither murderous nor peaceful.\n> Of course, maps vary in detail and in what they cover. Therefore, some maps\n> might be better for war and others better for trade. But the desire to wage\n> war or trade comes from the person using the map.\n>\n> Similarly, the neocortex learns a model of the world, which by itself has no\n> goals or values. The emotions that direct our behaviors are determined by\n> the old brain. If one human\u2019s old brain is aggressive, then it will use the\n> model in the neocortex to better execute aggressive behavior. If another\n> person\u2019s old brain is benevolent, then it will use the model in the\n> neocortex to better achieve its benevolent goals. As with maps, one person\u2019s\n> model of the world might be better suited for a particular set of aims, but\n> the neocortex does not create the goals.\n\nTo the extent this is an analogy to AI, large language models are intelligent,\nbut they do not have goals or values or drive. They are tools to be used by,\nwell, anyone who is willing and able to take the initiative to use them.\n\n### AI and the Sovereign Individual\n\nI don\u2019t think either Brownlee or I particularly need AI, or, to put it another\nway, are overly threatened by it. Yes, ChatGPT would have written several\nthousands words far more quickly than the hours it took me to write this\nArticle, but I am (perhaps foolishly) confident that they would not be\noriginal and valuable enough to take away my audience; I think it\u2019s the same\nfor Brownlee.\n\nThe connection between us and AI, though, is precisely the fact that we\nhaven\u2019t needed it: the nature of media is such that we could already create\ntext and video on our own, and take advantage of the Internet to \u2014 at least in\nthe case of Brownlee \u2014 deliver finishing blows to $230 million startups.\n\nHow many industries, though, are not media, in that they still need a team to\nimplement the vision of one person? How many apps or services are there that\nhaven\u2019t been built, not because one person can\u2019t imagine them or create them\nin their mind, but because they haven\u2019t had the resources or team or\ncoordination capabilities to actually ship them?\n\nThis gets at the vector through which AI impacts the world above and beyond\ncost savings in customer support, or whatever other obvious low-hanging fruit\nthere may be: as the ability of large language models to understand and\nexecute complex commands \u2014 with deterministic computing as needed \u2014 increases,\nso too does the potential power of the sovereign individual telling AI what to\ndo. The Internet removed the necessity \u2014 and inherent defensibility \u2014 of\ncomplex cost structures for media; AI has the potential to do the same for a\nfar greater host of industries.\n\nBrownlee\u2019s 2nd most popular video is only two months old: it\u2019s his overview of\nthe Apple Vision Pro; it\u2019s not, if fiction is our guide, an accident that Meta\nis developing the Quest and Apple has released the Vision Pro just as AI seems\npoised to threaten an ever-increasing number of jobs. This was the world\npainted by Pixar\u2019s Wall-E:\n\nIt\u2019s funny, because before I looked up this photo, I could have sworn the\nhumans in the film, lulled to insouciance by an AI that addressed all of their\nphysical needs, were wearing headsets; I guess Pixar overestimated our ability\nto build space-faring cruise ships and underestimated the relentless\nprogression of consumer electronics.\n\nMy suspicion, however, is that Pixar got it wrong, and this famous photo of\nMark Zuckerberg at Mobile World Congress in 2016 is closer to the truth of the\nmatter.\n\nWall-E erred by assuming that every human was the same, all gleefully enslaved\nby AUTO, the ships AI. In fact, though, I suspect humanity will be distributed\nbi-modally, with the vast majority of people happily wearing their Vision Pros\nor watching their streaming service or viewing their TikTok videos, while\nincreasingly sovereign individuals, aided by AI, pilot the ship.\n\nThat may sound extreme, but again, this is why it is useful to look to media\nfirst: Brownlee \u2014 one man, who started out by reviewing a media center remote\non his HP laptop \u2014 does in fact hold the fate of entire companies and products\nin his hand. My bet is not that AI replaces Brownlee, but that AI means\nBrownlee\u2019s for everything, not just media.\n\nAs for me, I plan on documenting it every step of the way, thanks to every\nperson who has supported Stratechery over the last 10 years, and to whom I\nalone owe accountability, and gratitude.\n\n  1. Actually, the deference Brownlee gave the vision and the potential of future upgrades was arguably generous\n\n  2. I previously spoke for pay, and even more previously offered consulting, and even more previously than that had ads; however, I ended ads in 2014, consulting in 2015, and haven\u2019t accepted any paid speaking opportunities since 2017. This is all covered on my about page.\n\n  3. $12/month or $120/year for the last five years, increasing to $15/month and $150/year on April 22\n\n### Share\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n\n### Related\n\nPassportThursday, June 3, 2021\n\nFree Daily Update: An Interview with Patreon CEO Jack Conte and Memberful CEO\nDrew StrojnyWednesday, August 8, 2018\n\nSharp Tech and Stratechery PlusTuesday, September 20, 2022\n\n# By Ben Thompson\n\nAbout Ben Follow via Email/RSS Twitter\n\n# Stratechery Plus\n\nAbout Stratechery Plus Subscribe Member Forum\n\n# Account\n\n  * Member\n\n  * Delivery Preferences\n  * Manage Account\n  * Sign Out\n\n  * Log In\n  * Sign Up\n\nLoading\n\n# Explore Stratechery\n\n  * Concepts\n  * Companies\n  * Topics\n\n# Archives\n\n  * Articles\n  * Updates\n  * Interviews\n  * Years in Review\n\n# Subscriber\u2019s Daily Update\n\nMonday, April 15, 2024\n\n# Intel\u2019s Modular Vision, Meta MTIA 2, Google Axion\n\nThursday, April 11, 2024\n\n# An Interview with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian About Google\u2019s Enterprise\nAI Strategy\n\nTuesday, April 9, 2024\n\n# Personal Day\n\nMonday, April 8, 2024\n\n# The Status of Just Walk Out, TSMC Gets CHIPS Act Grant\n\nOn the business, strategy, and impact of technology. \u00a9 Stratechery LLC 2024 | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy\n\n# Search results\n\nFiltersShow filters\n\nSort by:\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\n## No results found\n\n## Filter options\n\nSearch powered by Jetpack\n\n", "frontpage": true}
