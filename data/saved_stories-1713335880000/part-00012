It said that sales had risen since it created\nprice parity between meat and plant-based alternatives in October 2023. As\npart of its effort to encourage customers to choose plant-based, it also began\nplacing vegan products next to animal-based versions in stores.\n\nLidl has been at the forefront of the transition to plant-based protein among\nmajor food retailers. In February 2023 it announced it would reduce the amount\nof animal products it sells while expanding its vegan range. Lidl\u2019s chief\nbuyer Christoph Graf said at the time that there is \u201cno alternative\u201d if we\ngoing to \u201cfeed ourselves within planetary limits.\u201d\n\n## Healthier and more sustainable\n\nLidl Lidl sells animal-based and plant-based products side by side\n\nLidl launched its own-brand plant-based range Vemondo across Europe in 2021.\nIt includes around 50 products such as oat milk, pizza, cheese, tofu, and\nmince. Lidl says the products are carbon neutral. In 2022, Vemondo won PETA\u2019s\nVegan Food Award for Best Vegan Private Label.\n\nRead more: Lidl Named Cheapest UK Supermarket To Buy Vegan Christmas Food\n\nAs well as lowering prices for plant-based alternatives, Lidl maintains low\nprices for fruits and vegetables as part of its Healthy Eating Pledge. It aims\nto increase sales of fresh fruit and veg by 35 percent by 2026.\n\n## Change in Germany\n\nGermany is a fitting location for an event \u2013 which included politicians,\nbusinesspeople, and scientists \u2013 focused on transitioning to sustainable\nsources of protein. The country\u2019s newly published dietary guidelines recommend\nthat people eat at least 75 percent plant-based. The German government also\nrecently committed millions of euros to help boost development of plant-based\nproteins.\n\nRead more: Tesco Says It\u2019s In Its \u2018Second Phase\u2019 Of Plant-Based Growth\n\nMeat eating has hit a record low in Germany, with around 10 percent of people\nliving there now thought to follow a vegetarian diet. In addition, around 55\npercent of the population identify as \u201cflexitarian,\u201d meaning they already\nmostly eat plant-based foods.\n\nShare\n\nTagged\n\ngermany\n\nlidl\n\nplant-based products\n\n#### Join The Plant Based Newsletter and we will plant a tree!\n\nWe plant a tree for every signup.
