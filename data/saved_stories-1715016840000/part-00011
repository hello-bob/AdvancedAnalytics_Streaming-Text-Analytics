[Listener: Dikran\nKaragueuzian; date recorded: 2006] TRANSCRIPT: During the summer, between...\nbetween Case in Cleveland and Caltech in Pasadena, I had a summer job of\nwriting... writing compilers, this algebraic... this... this software that\nconverts algebraic language into machine language. I had a job writing a\ncompiler for Burroughs Corporation. Burroughs was headquartered in Pasadena \u2013\nI mean the Burroughs Division that... that was dealing with software was\nheadquartered in Pasadena \u2013 and Case had recently installed a Burroughs\ncomputer that I liked very much, during my senior year. Some people from\nThompson Ramo Wooldridge approached me and said, \u2018Don, we understand that you\ncan write compilers. We're going to put in a proposal to Burroughs to write a\ncompiler for their machine ( the... the Burroughs 205) for a language called\nALGOL\u2019, which was just... just being invented at that time \u2013 the ALGOrithmic\nLanguage an international standard, that was supposed to replace FORTRAN, the\nmost popular language at the time. And so Thompson Ramo Wooldridge was... made\na proposal to Burroughs for I believe it was $70,000, to create a ALGOL\ncompiler for the Burroughs 205. The people who made this proposal really,\nthough, were clueless about how to write compilers, so they hired me, a... a\nCase Senior, to... to do the job, because they had heard that I knew how to do\nit. I had done this RUNCIBLE and a... and a couple of versions of... of other\nsoftware at Case. So spring of my Senior year, they... they are showing me...\nthey're... they\u2019re showing me about this... this machine that Burroughs had,\nand I... and I started playing around with the.. with the computer, and I had\nlearned... got interested in the... in the project, but Burroughs turned them\ndown; they didn't give them the contract. So after Burroughs said, no, they\nweren't going to do it with Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, well I...I said, well,\nwait a minute, I've, maybe I'll write to Burroughs on my own, and I sent them\na letter and said, I'll, you know, for $5000 I can write you an ALGOL\ncompiler. Now $5000 was a huge amount of money in 1959... in 1960. I... I mean\na... a college professor was making $8000 a year or something like this. So\nI... I thought $5000 was... was an incredibly rich thing, you know, to... to\ndo. I said to Burroughs... no, I... except that... I can do it in the summer,\nexcept I won't have time to... to implement all of this ALGOL, I'll... I\u2019ll be\nable to do everything except procedures. I'll be able to, you know... which is\nactually the hardest thing to do in a compiler... which is of subroutines, the\nability to extend the language. Well, they wrote back saying you... we can't\nhave ALGOL without procedures, you've got to put procedures in too. And so I\nthought about it and said... and figured out, oh yeah... \u2018Okay, I see how I\ncan do it, but you'll... you\u2019ll have to pay me $5500, instead of $5000\u2019. So\nthey said, \u2018Okay\u2019. So I spent the summer of 1960, that's after... after\ngraduating from Case, I spent the summer writing this compiler for... for\nALGOL, for the Burroughs 205. And... and I wrote it... but really I... I had\nit only in pencil and paper, I didn't have it... I didn\u2019t have it ready to go,\nand... and then I would take it with me as I went out to Pasadena, and work on\nit there when I was at the Burroughs plant in Pasadena. So on my... on my way\nout West I had a little Volkswagen, that my ... I had gotten from my parents,\nand I drove 100 miles a day, and got a motel, and sat down, and wrote code,\nwrote software, and... and took 30 days to drive from Milwaukee to... to\nPasadena, every day writing a little bit of this software. Then I got to\nPasadena, and... and had all my code... had all my notes, and started putting\nit on to punched cards, and you know, debugging it and by Christmas time I had\ntheir compiler for them, and... and it was a machine that didn't sell very\nwell, so there weren't too many places in the world, but I... I heard for the\nnext 10 years that people in Brazil were still using it a lot, and... and so\nit was a... it was an interesting experience for me, but the most important,\nfrom my point of view, was I had $5500, which was enough to get married. And\nso... so in the summer of '61 Jill and I got married, and... and it paid for\nour honeymoon trip in Europe, which was our first time seeing... seeing the\nworld.\n\nShow less Show more\n\n##\n\nChapters\n\n#### Introduction\n\n#### Introduction\n\n0:00\n\n#### Introduction\n\n0:00\n\n#### Thomson Reuters\n\n#### Thomson Reuters\n\n1:10\n\n#### Thomson Reuters\n\n1:10\n\n#### Burroughs\n\n#### Burroughs\n\n1:40\n\n#### Burroughs\n\n1:40\n\n#### Burroughs compiler\n\n#### Burroughs compiler\n\n3:30\n\n#### Burroughs compiler\n\n3:30\n\n### Web of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People\n\n55.1K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\n## Comments 9\n\nTop comments\n\nNewest first\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# Donald Knuth - Writing a compiler for the Burroughs Corporation (27/97)\n\nWeb of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People\n\nWeb of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People\n\n55.1K subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n6.7K views 8 years ago\n\n6,774 views \u2022 Mar 3, 2016\n\nShow less\n\nTo listen to more of Donald Knuth\u2019s stories, go to the playlist: \u2022 Donald\nKnuth (Computer scientist) Donald Knuth (b. 1938), American computing pioneer,\nis known for his greatly influential multi-volume w ......more\n\n...more\n\n##\n\nChapters\n\n#### Introduction\n\n#### Introduction\n\n0:00\n\n#### Introduction\n\n0:00\n\n#### Thomson Reuters\n\n#### Thomson Reuters\n\n1:10\n\n#### Thomson Reuters\n\n1:10\n\n#### Burroughs\n\n#### Burroughs\n\n1:40\n\n#### Burroughs\n\n1:40\n\n#### Burroughs compiler\n\n#### Burroughs compiler\n\n3:30\n\n#### Burroughs compiler\n\n3:30\n\n### Web of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People\n\n55.1K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nShow less\n\n# Donald Knuth - Writing a compiler for the Burroughs Corporation (27/97)\n\n6,774 views6.7K views\n\nMar 3, 2016\n\nDownload\n\n### 1963 Timesharing: A Solution to Computer Bottlenecks\n\nComputer History Museum\n\nComputer History Museum\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n168K views 14 years ago\n\n### The Most Famous Computer Science Books In The World\n\nThe Math Sorcerer\n\nThe Math Sorcerer\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n159K views 1 year ago\n\n### Network Diagrams and More With Draw.io - An Open Source Drawing\nApplication\n\nSYNACK Time\n\nSYNACK Time\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n246 views 2 days ago\n\nNew\n\n97 videos Now playing\n\n### Donald Knuth (Computer scientist)\n\nWeb of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People \u00b7 Playlist\n\nWeb of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People \u00b7 Playlist\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n### Donald Knuth - Feeling the need to prove myself (9/97)\n\nWeb of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People\n\nWeb of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n14K views 8 years ago\n\n### 1963 Burroughs Computer History Archives: Datatron, ElectroData, B5000,\nB270 UNISYS VIPclub\n\nComputer History Archives Project (\"CHAP\")\n\nComputer History Archives Project (\"CHAP\")\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n34K views 6 years ago\n\n### Parser and Lexer \u2014 How to Create a Compiler part 1/5 \u2014 Converting text\ninto an Abstract Syntax Tree\n\nBisqwit\n\nBisqwit\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n400K views 6 years ago\n\n### Digital DEC PDP-11 - Disc Packs, Tape Drives and Terminals!\n\nThe Centre for Computing History\n\nThe Centre for Computing History\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n29K views 7 years ago\n\n### \"C\" Programming Language: Brian Kernighan - Computerphile\n\nComputerphile\n\nComputerphile\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n1.8M views 8 years ago\n\n### Donald Knuth - The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm (92/97)\n\nWeb of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People\n\nWeb of Stories - Life Stories of Remarkable People\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n12K views 8 years ago\n\n### AT&T Archives: The UNIX Operating System\n\nAT&T Tech Channel\n\nAT&T Tech Channel\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n1.9M views 12 years ago\n\n### Why flat earthers scare me\n\nSabine Hossenfelder\n\nSabine Hossenfelder\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n221K views 1 day ago\n\nNew\n\n### Stan Lee - The Elements of a Page Turner\n\nAuthor Learning Center\n\nAuthor Learning Center\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n22K views 12 years ago\n\n### 1964 Burroughs Computers Computer History (B5000, B280, BUIC D825;
