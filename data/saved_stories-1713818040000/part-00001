We agreed that the current version was indeed a\nturd!\n\nMy colleague wanted a full rewrite; I was pushing for TheeSeeShipping, an\niterative approach.\n\nShould we build a new report with a new UI, or reskin (frost) the original\nreport and iterate?\n\nShould we tell customers that something new is coming, or show our progress\nand solicit their feedback?\n\nWhen you have knowingly served turd to your customers, what are the odds that\nyou can pick the right frosting and cupcake flavor?\n\nHow many turds are you willing to serve while you figure it out?\n\nFrost the turd every time!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### jeffpsherman\n\n### Post Navigation\n\nPrevious Post:\n\n#### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Fifty, Fulfilling Friday \u2013 Saving\nCustomers Millions\n\n### Related Posts:\n\n#### Phase 1 is a Millstone not a Milestone\n\nJanuary 10, 2024 jeffpsherman\n\n#### Smile And Dial CRM \u2013 Part 3 \u2013 Invisible Shipping\n\nJuly 25, 2023 jeffpsherman\n\n#### TheeSeeShip \u2013 The Opposite of a Rewrite\n\nApril 18, 2023 jeffpsherman\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n### Site Sidebar\n\n#### Categories\n\n  * crm\n  * Cross Post\n  * dev teams\n  * iterative delivery\n  * podcast\n  * software design\n  * Uncategorized\n\n#### Recent Posts\n\n  * ##### Frosting A Turd And Iterating To A Cupcake\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n  * ##### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Fifty, Fulfilling Friday \u2013 Saving Customers Millions\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n  * ##### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Forty-Nine, Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Projects Part 2\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n  * ##### Fixing All The Bugs Won\u2019t Solve All The Problems \u2013 Deming\u2019s Path Of Frustration\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n  * ##### The Never Rewrite Podcast, Episode Forty-Eight, Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Projects\n\nApril 6, 2024\n\n#### Tags\n\n#batr #best-alternative-to-a-total-rewrite #development #neverrewrite #SaaS\nadvice ai always be releasing automation batr best-alternative-to-a-total-\nrewrite crm iterative delivery never rewrite podcast programming queues SaaS\nsame but better scaling software architecture software development team\ndynamics Tenancy Model testing TheeSeeShip\n\n### Site Footer\n\n## Discover more from Sherman On Software\n\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\nContinue reading\n\n%d\n\n", "frontpage": false}
