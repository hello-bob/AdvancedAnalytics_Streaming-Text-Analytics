She is also the host of\nHell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and\nAudible Originals.\n\nMay 1, 2024, 12:00 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nWastewater pipes at a reclamation plant in California on Wednesday, August 4,\n2021.\n\nGetty Images\n\naBig brands are paying startup Vaulted Deep $58.3 million to shoot poop and\nother organic waste products into underground wells as a way to fight climate\nchange.\n\nThe deal was brokered by a group called Frontier Climate, which Stripe,\nAlphabet, Meta, Shopify, and McKinsey Sustainability launched in 2022 to\nsupport emerging climate tech. Specifically, Frontier is interested in trying\nto remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They connect buyers with\nstartups like Vaulted Deep that are developing ways to capture CO2 and\nsequester it underground so that it doesn\u2019t heat up the planet.\n\nVaulted Deep\u2019s strategy is to gather sewage, manure, and agricultural and\npaper mill waste and inject it deep underground to keep carbon in the waste\nfrom rising into the atmosphere as it decomposes. On top of Frontier\u2019s\nfounding companies, Autodesk, H&M Group, JPMorgan Chase, Workday, and other\nbrands are also part of the deal Frontier announced today. Vaulted Deep agreed\nto sequester 152,480 tons of carbon dioxide by 2027 as part of the deal.\nThat\u2019s equivalent to taking around 36,000 gas-guzzling cars off the road for a\nyear.\n\nIt\u2019s Frontier\u2019s biggest agreement yet and a big endorsement of Vaulted Deep\u2019s\ntechnology\n\nIt\u2019s Frontier\u2019s biggest agreement yet and a big endorsement of Vaulted Deep\u2019s\ntechnology that the startup says will allow it to scale up a lot faster than\nits competitors in the growing carbon removal industry.\n\nVaulted Deep says its advantage is that it is built on technology that\u2019s\nalready been used for decades to get rid of sludge from oil and gas fracking.\nHydraulic fracturing \u2014 aka fracking \u2014 is a particularly messy way to extract\nfossil fuels. Companies needed to find a way to dispose of all the rock and\nfluids leftover from drilling that might carry heavy metals like arsenic and\nradioactive materials like uranium.\n\nOmar Abou-Sayed, Vaulted Deep\u2019s executive chairman, says his father and his\ncolleagues developed the technology to inject the nasty stuff deep underground\nwhile working for Arco. His dad went on to become a consultant to other\ncompanies that needed to comply with rules established under the 1972 Clean\nWater Act.\n\nThe trick is to find a way to inject solid waste underground without plugging\nup the well (Abou-Sayed compares the problem to grounds building up on a\ncoffee filter). He adopted his dad\u2019s technology to do the same with carbon-\nrich organic waste, injecting it with enough pressure to open up fissures and\npores in rock.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no technology magic that has to happen. It\u2019s not a science fair\nexperiment. So our coming down the cost curve is not [like other companies]\nwhere they have to invent science to do the thing they\u2019re doing more\nefficiently,\u201d says Abou-Sayed. \u201cOurs is more like the McDonald\u2019s problem of\nwhat\u2019s the best intersection to put the McDonald\u2019s to get the most car\ntraffic.\u201d\n\nCarbon dioxide removal is an umbrella term for a suite of technologies being\ndeveloped to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. These technologies\ncould potentially help slow climate change by trapping some of the pollution\nfossil fuels have already released over the years. There are still concerns\nabout its costs, safety, and potential to delay a transition from fossil fuels\nto carbon pollution-free energy. Experts say carbon removal is no substitute\nfor preventing greenhouse gas emissions in the first place.\n\nA flurry of other companies have opened up shop to suck carbon dioxide out of\nthe air or water, but it\u2019s still an exorbitantly expensive endeavor. The US\nmight need to spend roughly $100 billion a year on these kinds of technologies\nin order to scale up to a level that would help the country meet its climate\ngoals, according to one recent report.\n\nThe company operating the largest facility filtering CO2 out of the air today\ncharges customers (including Microsoft, Stripe, and Shopify) roughly $600 per\nton of captured CO2. Frontier\u2019s deal with Vaulted Deep breaks down to around\n$382 per ton, although the industry goal is still to get to under $100 per ton\nto make it a feasible tool for tackling climate change. Vaulted Deep says\nit\u2019ll reach that goal in large part by siting its wells closer to where it\u2019s\ngetting the waste it pumps underground. The deal with Frontier is supposed to\nenable the company to commission three new wells in the US (if it can get the\npermits for them, of course).\n\nVaulted Deep already takes about 20 percent of Los Angeles\u2019 sewage sludge, for\nexample. That might be a better feedstock for this technology than manure or\nfarm waste that could be reused as fertilizer in regenerative agriculture. \u201cIt\njust seems like a lot of good stuff along with some bad stuff that\u2019s going to\ngo down into a hole forever,\u201d says Brian Roe, a professor of farm management\nat Ohio State University. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have more tools in the toolbox. I\u2019m\njust kind of fascinated to figure out where this is going to work.\u201d\n\nTo have a positive environmental impact, Vaulted Deep will have to prove in\nits carbon accounting that it\u2019s actually avoiding CO2 emissions. If a farm\ngives up manure that it otherwise would have used to add nutrients back to the\nsoil, for instance \u2014 what are the environmental costs of that farm potentially\nturning to synthetic fertilizers instead? Vaulted Deep says it\u2019s taking these\nkinds of questions into account and is working with a carbon removal registry\ncalled Isometric to vet its process.\n\nVaulted Deep just spun off from waste management company Advantek, where Abou-\nSayed is also executive chairman, in September. But its mature technology\nmeans \u201cthat we were sort of born a teenager,\u201d says Vaulted Deep CEO Julia\nReichelstein, who was an investor at climate VC fund Piva Capital before she\nhopped on board. \u201cWhen I met Omar ... there was an aha moment,\u201d she says, and\nFrontier\u2019s backing now is, \u201creally huge.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Elon Musk goes \u2018absolutely hard core\u2019 in another round of Tesla layoffs\n\n  2. ## Automatic emergency braking at speeds up to 90mph required under new rule\n\n  3. ## Turns out the Rabbit R1 was just an Android app all along\n\n  4. ## Razer made a million dollars selling a mask with RGB, and the FTC is not pleased\n\n  5. ## Binance founder\u2019s sentencing hearing\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Science\n\n  * ### Even Walmart thinks American healthcare is too expensive\n\n  * ### A new intergovernmental group will try to stem abuses tied to critical mineral mining\n\n  * ### Razer made a million dollars selling a mask with RGB, and the FTC is not pleased\n\n  * ### They turned cattle ranches into tropical forest \u2014 then climate change hit\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
