The two amplitude-modulated\ncomponents are known as the in-phase component (I, thin blue, decreasing) and\nthe quadrature component (Q, thin red, increasing).\n\nA sinusoid with modulation can be decomposed into, or synthesized from, two\namplitude-modulated sinusoids that are in quadrature phase, i.e., with a phase\noffset of one-quarter cycle (90 degrees or \u03c0/2 radians). All three sinusoids\nhave the same center frequency. The two amplitude-modulated sinusoids are\nknown as the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components, which describes their\nrelationships with the amplitude- and phase-modulated carrier.^[A]^[2]\n\nOr in other words, it is possible to create an arbitrarily phase-shifted sine\nwave, by mixing together two sine waves that are 90\u00b0 out of phase in different\nproportions.\n\nThe implication is that the modulations in some signal can be treated\nseparately from the carrier wave of the signal. This has extensive use in many\nradio and signal processing applications.^[3] I/Q data is used to represent\nthe modulations of some carrier, independent of that carrier's frequency.\n\n## Orthogonality[edit]\n\nSee also: List of trigonometric identities \u00a7 Linear combinations\n\nIn vector analysis, a vector with polar coordinates A, \u03c6 and Cartesian\ncoordinates x = A cos(\u03c6), y = A sin(\u03c6), can be represented as the sum of\northogonal components: [x, 0] + [0, y]. Similarly in trigonometry, the angle\nsum identity expresses:\n\n    sin(x + \u03c6) = sin(x) cos(\u03c6) + sin(x + \u03c0/2) sin(\u03c6).\n\nAnd in functional analysis, when x is a linear function of some variable, such\nas time, these components are sinusoids, and they are orthogonal functions. A\nphase-shift of x \u2192 x + \u03c0/2 changes the identity to:\n\n    cos(x + \u03c6) = cos(x) cos(\u03c6) + cos(x + \u03c0/2) sin(\u03c6),\n\nin which case cos(x) cos(\u03c6) is the in-phase component. In both conventions\ncos(\u03c6) is the in-phase amplitude modulation, which explains why some authors\nrefer to it as the actual in-phase component.\n\n## Narrowband signal model[edit]\n\nIn an angle modulation application, with carrier frequency f, \u03c6 is also a\ntime-variant function, giving:^[1]^: eqs.(4.45)&(7.64)\n\n    (Eq.1)  \n---  \n  \nWhen all three terms above are multiplied by an optional amplitude function,\nA(t) > 0, the left-hand side of the equality is known as the amplitude/phase\nform, and the right-hand side is the quadrature-carrier or IQ form.^[B]\nBecause of the modulation, the components are no longer completely orthogonal\nfunctions. But when A(t) and \u03c6(t) are slowly varying functions compared to\n2\u03c0ft, the assumption of orthogonality is a common one.^[C] Authors often call\nit a narrowband assumption, or a narrowband signal model.^[4]^[5]\n\n## I/Q data[edit]\n\nA stream of information about how to amplitude-modulate the I and Q phases of\na sine wave is known as the I/Q data.^[6] By just amplitude-modulating these\ntwo 90\u00b0-out-of-phase sine waves and adding them, it is possible to produce the\neffect of arbitrarily modulating some carrier: amplitude and phase.\n\nA phasor for I/Q, and the resultant wave which is continually phase shifting,\naccording to the phasor's frequency. Note that since this resultant wave is\ncontinuously phase shifting at a steady rate, effectively the frequency has\nbeen changed: it has been frequency modulated.\n\nAnd if the IQ data itself has some frequency (e.g. a phasor) then the carrier\nalso can be frequency modulated. So I/Q data is a complete representation of\nhow a carrier is modulated: amplitude, phase and frequency.\n\nFor received signals, by determining how much in-phase carrier and how much\nquadrature carrier is present in the signal it is possible to represent that\nsignal using in-phase and quadrature components, so IQ data can get generated\nfrom a signal with reference to a carrier sine wave.\n\nIQ modulation and demodulation. LO is the local oscillator - the carrier sine\nwave being modulated I(t) and Q(t) are the time-series data for the in-phase\nand quadrature components. S is the signal\n\nIQ data has extensive use in many signal processing contexts, including for\nradio modulation, software-defined radio, audio signal processing and\nelectrical engineering.\n\nI/Q data is a two-dimensional stream. Some sources treat I/Q as a complex\nnumber;^[1] with the I and Q components corresponding to the real and\nimaginary parts. Others treat it as distinct pairs of values, as a 2D vector,\nor as separate streams.\n\nWhen called \"I/Q data\" the information is likely digital. However, I/Q may be\nrepresented as analogue signals.^[7] The concepts are applicable to both the\nanalog and digital representations of IQ.\n\nThis technique of using I/Q data to represent the modulations of a signal\nseparate to the signal's frequency is known as equivalent baseband signal,\nsupported by the \u00a7 Narrowband signal model. It is sometimes referred to as\nvector modulation.\n\nThe data rate of I/Q is largely independent to the frequency of the signal\nbeing modulated. I/Q data can be generated at a relatively slow rate (e.g.\nmillions of bits per second), perhaps generated by software in part of the\nphysical layer of a protocol stack. I/Q data is used to modulate a carrier\nfrequency, which may be faster (e.g. Gigahertz, perhaps an intermediate\nfrequency).^[8]\n\nAs well as within a transmitter, I/Q data is also a common means to represent\nthe signal from some receiver. Designs such as the Digital down converter\nallow the input signal to be represented as streams of IQ data, likely for\nfurther processing and symbol extraction in a DSP. Analog systems may suffer\nfrom issues, such as IQ imbalance.\n\nI/Q data may also be used as a means to capture and store data used in\nspectrum monitoring.^[3] Since I/Q allows the representation of the modulation\nseparate to the actual carrier frequency, it is possible to represent a\ncapture of all the radio traffic in some RF band or section thereof, with a\nreasonable amount of data, irrespective of the frequency being monitored. E.g.\nif there is a capture of 100 MHz of Wi-Fi channels within the 5 GHz U-NII\nband, that IQ capture can be sampled at 200 million samples per second\n(according to Nyquist) as opposed to the 10,000 million samples per second\nrequired to sample directly at 5 GHz.\n\nA vector signal generator will typically use I/Q data alongside some\nprogrammed frequency to generate its signal.^[8] And similarly a vector signal\nanalyser can provide a stream of I/Q data in its output. Many modulation\nschemes, e.g. quadrature amplitude modulation rely heavily on I/Q.\n\n## Alternating current (AC) circuits[edit]\n\nThe term alternating current applies to a voltage vs. time function that is\nsinusoidal with a frequency f. When it is applied to a typical (linear time-\ninvariant) circuit or device, it causes a current that is also sinusoidal. In\ngeneral there is a constant phase difference \u03c6 between any two sinusoids. The\ninput sinusoidal voltage is usually defined to have zero phase, meaning that\nit is arbitrarily chosen as a convenient time reference. So the phase\ndifference is attributed to the current function, e.g. sin(2\u03c0ft + \u03c6), whose\northogonal components are sin(2\u03c0ft) cos(\u03c6) and sin(2\u03c0ft + \u03c0/2) sin(\u03c6), as we\nhave seen. When \u03c6 happens to be such that the in-phase component is zero, the\ncurrent and voltage sinusoids are said to be in quadrature, which means they\nare orthogonal to each other. In that case, no average (active) electrical\npower is consumed. Rather power is temporarily stored by the device and given\nback, once every 1/2f seconds. Note that the term in quadrature only implies\nthat two sinusoids are orthogonal, not that they are components of another\nsinusoid.\n\n  * When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to either a simple capacitor or inductor, the resultant current that flows is \"in quadrature\" with the voltage.\n\n  * IQ phasor diagram\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Analytic signal\n  * IQ imbalance\n  * Constellation diagram\n  * Negative frequency\n  * Phasor\n  * Polar modulation\n  * Quadrature amplitude modulation\n  * Single-sideband modulation\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ The low-frequency modulating waveforms are also referred to as the I and Q components.^[1]^: p.82\n  2. ^ The negative sign in Eq.1 can be associated with either the quadrature carrier or its amplitude modulation. In the former case, Q-carrier leads I-carrier by cycle. Otherwise, it lags by cycle. The distinction is not important, but it can be confusing.\n  3. ^ Orthogonality is important in many applications, including demodulation, direction-finding, and bandpass sampling.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Franks, L.E.
