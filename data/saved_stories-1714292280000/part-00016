Beeching/Ludes et al., 2024\n\n#### reader comments\n\n68\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the remains of three women in a Neolithic tomb\nin France, with the positioning of two of the bodies suggesting they may have\nbeen ritualistically murdered by asphyxia or self-strangulation, according to\na recent paper published in the journal Science Advances.\n\n(WARNING: graphic descriptions below.)\n\nFrance's Rh\u00f4ne Valley is home to several archaeological sites dating to the\nend of the Middle Neolithic period (between 4250 and 3600/3500 BCE in the\nregion); the sites include various storage silos, broken grindstones, imported\nceramics, animal remains (both from communal meals and sacrifices), and human\nremains deposited in sepulchral pits. Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch\u00e2teaux is one such\nsite.\n\nAccording to Bertrand Ludes of the Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9 and his co-authors,\nthe remains of the three women were found in Pit 69, a structure aligned with\nthe summer and winter solstices, as was often the case in ancient agrarian\nsocieties. But the body positioning was decidedly atypical. One woman (No. 1),\naround age 50, was in the center of the pit, reclining on her side with a vase\nnear her head. The other two bodies were just beneath an overhang. Woman No. 2\nwas on her back, legs bent, with a piece of grindstone placed on her skull.\nWoman No. 3 was in a prone position, knees bent, with her neck on the thorax\nof Woman No. 2 and two chunks of grindstone placed on her back.\n\nThe unusual positions imply a forceful, deliberate placement, according to the\nauthors, suggesting they died in the pit rather than being tossed in after\ndeath. As for the cause of death, the archaeological evidence combined with\nrecent forensic studies suggests \"homicidal ligature strangulation\" and\n\"forced positional asphyxia\"\u2014at least for two of the three women. Woman No. 2,\nfor example, would have struggled to breathe on her back, especially with the\nweight of Woman No. 3 pressing down on her neck (positional asphyxia), further\nexacerbated by the placement of the grindstone fragment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch\u00e2teaux and the area surrounding pits 69 and 70.\n\nLudes et al., Sci. Adv. 10, eadl3374 (2024)\n\nWoman No. 3's prone position would mean she also would have struggled to\nbreathe, and the volume of blood pumped by the heart would have sharply\ndecreased, leading to cardiac arrest, a form of positional asphyxia now known\nas \"prone restraint cardiac arrest.\" All these clinical terms don't quite\ncapture the horrifically cruel nature of the manner of death. Given the\nplacement of the woman's knees\u2014bent at more than a 90-degree angle, making the\nlegs almost vertical\u2014it's possible she was tied up lying on her stomach, with\nthe ligature connecting her ankles to her neck (similar to being hog-tied). In\nthis position, \"self-strangulation becomes inevitable,\" the authors wrote,\nparticularly if the mouth and nose are obstructed or there is cervical\ncompression\u2014say, from the strategic placement of grindstone fragments.\n\nThis form of torture, known as incaprettamento, has been used by the Italian\nMafia, per Ludes et al., often to punish traitors, and dates as far back as\nthe Italian Mesolithic era, \"suggesting a highly ancient origin within\nceremonial sites.\" Sometimes, the victim would be strangled and the body tied\nup postmortem before the remains were disposed of. Ludes et al. believe Woman\nNo. 3 would probably have been placed in the burial pit and tied up while\nstill alive before self-strangling to death.\n\n  * Reconstruction of the remains, blocked under the overhang of the wall of the storage pit lined with straw.\n\nLudes et al., Sci. Adv. 10, eadl3374 (2024)\n\n  * Reconstruction of skeletal remains for Woman No. 2 positioned on her back with bent knees.\n\nLudes et al., Sci. Adv. 10, eadl3374 (2024)\n\n  * Reconstruction of skeletal remains for Woman No. 3 in a prone position on her stomach with bent knees. The feet are behind the pelvis/toward the lower back, and the hands are tied behind the back.\n\nLudes et al., Sci. Adv. 10, eadl3374 (2024)\n\n  * Mesolithic rock art scene from the Addaura Cave is believed to depict ritual sacrifice by ligature strangulation (bolded figure).\n\nB. Ludes et al., 2024\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nIn fact, one scene from Mesolithic rock art found in the Addaura Cave in\nSicily, Italy, seems to depict a ritual sacrifice by ligature strangulation.\nThere are 11 human figures and the figure of a slain deer. Nine of the human\nfigures form a circle, within which are the other two human figures (male,\njudging by the erect genitalia). Those figures are shown lying on their\nstomachs in a prone position, legs folded beneath them, with a rope stretched\nbetween their ankles and necks. The erect male genitalia, and one figure drawn\nwith his tongue hanging out, are both signs of strangulation or hanging, per\nthe authors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is notoriously difficult to distinguish between a merely violent death and\none with ritualistic overtones when it comes to prehistoric remains. So Ludes\net al. combed through existing literature for reports of similar cases. They\nfound 20 cases of probable ligature strangulation or positional asphyxia in\ntotal across 14 different archaeological sites in Eastern Europe and\nCatalonia, spanning nearly 2,000 years. The individuals were found lying on\ntheir backs or sides, lower limbs flexed until the feet aligned with the\npelvis, indicating hip extension. The oldest remains were found at sites in\nthe Czech Republic and date back to between 5400 and 4800 BCE; the three women\nfound at Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch\u00e2teaux are the most recent.\n\nThe latter site in particular has elements that \"suggest a profound\ninterconnection between religious systems and power structure in an\nagricultural society,\" the authors concluded\u2014namely, various structures\naligned with summer and winter solstices indicative of an agricultural cycle\nand the placement of two women facing the central woman. It's unclear why the\nwomen were sacrificed, the authors added, but such ritualistic sacrifice\nlikely developed across central and southern Europe sometime in the Mesolithic\nand evolved over the course of two millennia before culminating in the late\nMiddle Neolithic.\n\nScience Advances, 2024.
