The contract, a \u201cdirect to phase 2\u201d SBIR award, is in partnership with\nSpace Systems Command\u2019s Space Safari Program Office.\n\nGravitics, based near Seattle, is developing modules for use on future\ncommercial space stations. One concept, called StarMax, is a cylindrical\nmodule with an aluminum full 7.6 meters in diameter and offers 400 cubic\nmeters of volume, about 40% of the volume of the entire International Space\nStation.\n\nThe company said it will apply those technologies for tactically responsive\nspace, or TacRS, applications. \u201cGravitics\u2019 commercial space station modules\ncan support a wide range of military and civilian applications, including in-\nspace rapid response applications,\u201d the company said in a statement about the\nSBIR award.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at all options to meet the mission on tactically relevant\ntimelines. The Gravitics space station module offers an unconventional and\npotentially game-changing solution for TacRS,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jason Altenhofen,\ndirector of operations for Space Safari, a part of Space Systems Command\nleading work on tactically responsive space applications, in the statement.\n\nThe company did not elaborate on the specific work it will be doing under the\nSBIR or how its module technologies would be used for tactically responsive\nspace. A source familiar with the effort said that the award covered work on\narchitectures, requirements and initial hardware development.\n\nSpaceWERX organized a TacRS Space Challenge last year to seek concepts from\nindustry in space and ground systems to support tactically responsive space.\nAltenhofen said last fall that the challenge was intended to \u201csend a demand\nsignal\u201d to industry about tactically responsive space, offering SBIR awards\nand opportunities for future work.\n\nGravitics said it is working with Rocket Lab, True Anomaly, Space Exploration\nEngineering and Eta Space on its contract. Rocket Lab and True Anomaly won\nSpace Force contracts April 11 to develop the Victus Haze tactically\nresponsive space mission. Space Exploration Engineering does work in the\ndesign, planning and operations of space missions. Eta Space is developing\ncryogenic fluid technologies and has a NASA contract to perform a flight test\nof a liquid oxygen fluid management system.\n\nThe company says the Space Force contract does not represent a change in\ndirection. \u201cDeveloping and manufacturing commercial space station modules will\ncontinue to be at the core of our company mission,\u201d Colin Doughan, chief\nexecutive of Gravitics, said in a statement. \u201cGravitics is thrilled to have\nthe opportunity to offer these commercial capabilities to the Department of\nDefense.\u201d\n\n### Related\n\n#### Max Space announces plans for inflatable space station modules\n\nMax Space has unveiled plans to develop inflatable modules that the company\nbelieves can be made larger and less expensive than alternatives\n\n#### The paradox of U.S. government R&D funding: Barriers for non-U.S. owned\nfirms\n\nThe U.S. government craves innovation but sets barriers via ownership\nstipulations, contrasting with other nations open to R&D funding with less\nstringent conditions.\n\n#### Danti gets U.S. Space Force contract for data search engine\n\nDanti, a startup that developed a geospatial data search engine, was awarded a\n$1.2 million contract by the U.S. Space Force to further develop its AI-\nenabled technology.\n\nTagged: Gravitics, SpaceWERX, TacRS, U.S. Space Force\n\n## Jeff Foust\n\nJeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for\nSpaceNews.
