However, Israel has yet to provide\nsupporting evidence of this,\u201d according to the 54-page final report,\nIndependent review of mechanisms and procedures to ensure adherence by UNRWA\nto the humanitarian principle of neutrality.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General, who received the final report at the weekend, had\nappointed the independent review group days after Israel announced the\nallegations against UNRWA, which employees 30,000 people and serves 5.9\nmillion Palestine refugees in the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and war-\ntorn Gaza.\n\nThe much-awaited final report found that UNRWA, established by the General\nAssembly in 1949, has extensive tools in place to ensure it remains unbiased\nin its work and routinely provides Israel with employee lists and \u201cthe Israeli\nGovernment has not informed UNRWA of any concerns relating to any UNRWA staff\nbased on these staff lists since 2011.\u201d\n\n## UNRWA has \u2018most elaborate\u2019 rules within UN system\n\n\u201cThe set of rules and the mechanisms and procedures in place [at UNRWA] are\nthe most elaborate within the UN system, precisely because it is such a\ndifficult issue to work in such a complex and sensitive environment,\u201d\nCatherine Colonna, former French foreign minister and head of the review\ngroup, told journalists at UN Headquarters following the report\u2019s launch.\n\u201cWhat needs to be improved will be improved. I\u2019m confident that implementing\nthese measures will help UNRWA deliver on its mandate.\u201d\n\nStrongly encouraging \"the international community to work side by side with\nthe agency so it can perform its mission and overcome the challenges when they\nare there\", she said \u201cthis is the purpose of the review.\u201d\n\nIn its nine-week-long review of existing mechanisms, the group conducted more\nthan 200 interviews, met with Israeli and Palestinian authorities and directly\ncontacted 47 countries and organisations, presenting a set of 50\nrecommendations on issues ranging from education to fresh vetting processes\nfor recruiting staff.\n\n\u00a9 UNRWA/Mohammed Hinnawi\n\nFlour is distributed in Rafah, Gaza.\n\n## Report steers new UN action plan\n\nThe report\u2019s recommendations include creating a centralised \u201cneutrality\ninvestigations unit\u201d, rolling out an updated Code of Ethics and associated\ntraining to all staff, and identifying and implementing additional ways to\nscreen UNRWA applicants at an early stage of the recruitment process.\n\nThe report also suggested exploring the possibility of third-party monitoring\nfor sensitive projects and establishing a framework with interested donors to\nensure transparency.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Spokesperson said the UN\nchief accepts the recommendations contained in Ms. Colonna\u2019s report. He has\nagreed with Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini that UNRWA, with the\nSecretary-General\u2019s support, will establish an action plan to implement the\nrecommendations contained in the final report.\u201d\n\n## Claims financially hobbled UNRWA\n\nAccording to the review group\u2019s final report, Israel\u2019s claims against UNRWA\ntriggered the suspension of funding amounting to around $450 million.\n\nThe direct impact of Israel\u2019s allegations swiftly hobbled UNRWA\u2019s ability to\ncontinue its work. Operating solely on voluntary donations, UNRWA saw major\ndonors, including the United States, cancelling or suspending funds for the\nagency.\n\nIn April, Washington banned funding for UNRWA until at least 2025, but other\ndonors have pledged additional funding or restored their donations.\n\nThe new report recommended increasing the frequency and strengthening the\ntransparency of UNRWA\u2019s communication with donors on its financial situation\nand on neutrality allegations and breaches. The review group suggested regular\nupdates and \u201cintegrity briefings\u201d for donors interested in supporting UNRWA on\nintegrity and related issues.\n\n## Findings on UNRWA schools\n\nThe UN agency delivers on its obligation to ensure neutrality of its 1,000\ninstallations, including schools, healthcare centres and warehouses, according\nto the report, which also stated that \u201csecurity and capacity challenges may\nhamper\u201d existing due diligence mechanisms.\n\nThe review group said UNRWA \u201chas consistently worked on ensuring neutrality in\neducation\u201d as it provides elementary and preparatory education for 500,000\npupils in 706 schools with 20,000 educational staff, including in Gaza, where\nright now all children are out of school following attacks destroying the\nenclave\u2019s education system amid the ongoing conflict.\n\nZiad Abu Khousa\n\nUNRWA's office in Gaza.\n\n## Claims of anti-Semitic textbooks\n\nInvestigating \u201csustained criticism, mainly from Israel\u201d, about the alleged\npresence of hate speech, incitement to violence and anti-Semitism in\nPalestinian Authority educational material, the review group examined three\nmajor international assessments and studies.\n\nThe new report showed that two identified bias and non-compliant content, but\ndid not provide evidence of anti-Semitic reference. A third, the Eckert\nreport, identified two examples that displayed anti-Semitic content, but noted\nthat one had already been removed and the other significantly altered.\n\nAs such, the report recommended several actions, including the review of the\ncontent of all textbooks with host countries, Israel and the Palestinian\nAuthority.\n\n## UNRWA remains a pivotal \u2018lifeline\u2019 for Palestine\n\nThe report stated that \u201cin the absence of a political solution between Israel\nand the Palestinians, UNRWA remains pivotal in providing lifesaving\nhumanitarian aid and essential social services, particularly in health and\neducation, to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the\nWest Bank\u201d and is \u201cirreplaceable and indispensable to Palestinians\u2019 human and\neconomic development\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn addition, many view UNRWA as a humanitarian lifeline,\u201d according to the\nreport.\n\nThe UN chief on Monday said he counted on the cooperation of the donor\ncommunity, the host countries and the staff to fully cooperate in the\nimplementation of the new report\u2019s final recommendations, the UN Spokesperson\nsaid.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, the Secretary-General appeals to all stakeholders to actively\nsupport UNRWA, as it is a lifeline for Palestine refugees in the region,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nOther top UN officials have voiced strong support for the agency, calling on\ndonors to reverse funding cuts and allow UNRWA to perform its work, especially\nin Gaza.\n\nIn late March, Israel announced it would reject UNRWA\u2019s requests to deliver\naid into northern Gaza, where a famine is unfolding as Israeli authorities\ncontinue to block or severely delay lifesaving aid shipments, according to UN\nofficials, who launched an appeal last week for emergency funding.\n\n\u00a9 UNRWA\n\nThe UN continues to provide humanitarian aid in Gaza.\n\n## First of two investigations\n\nFollowing Israel\u2019s allegations against UNRWA in late January, the UN agency\nimmediately fired the staff members in question and requested a swift,\nimpartial investigation. The UN chief ordered two.\n\nDays later, the Secretary-General appointed an independent review team, led by\nMs. Colonna and researched by Raoul Wallenberg Institute in Sweden, the\nMichelsen Institute in Norway and the Danish Institute for Human Rights, to\ninvestigate the UNRWA\u2019s process of ensuring neutrality in its work.\n\nAt the same time, the UN chief ordered the UN\u2019s top watchdog, the Office of\nInternal Oversight (OIOS), to investigate the veracity of Israel\u2019s claims\nagainst the 12 UNRWA staff members.\n\nAt the outset, OIOS investigators reached out to Member States concerned,\nvisited UNRWA headquarters in Jordan and reviewed initial information received\nby the agency from Israeli authorities and from a variety of sources,\nincluding that released through the media and other public outlets.\n\nThat investigation is ongoing.\n\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\n\n  * UNRWA\n\n## Related Stories\n\n### UN chief praises impact of Palestine refugee agency as \u2018our common\nsuccess\u2019, at key pledging conference\n\n### Donors come to UN agency\u2019s aid with extra $118 million to help Palestine\nrefugees\n\n### Dramatic funding shortages a \u2018severe catastrophe\u2019 for people of Gaza: UN\nCoordinator\n\n## News Tracker: Past Stories on This Issue\n\n### Guterres upholds UNRWA as a 'lifeline' following receipt of independent\npanel's report\n\n22 April 2024\n\nPeace and Security\n\nUN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres issued an appeal on Monday to \u201cactively support\u201d the\nUN agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, adding that he accepted the final findings\nof an independent probe into the organization, launched amid serious\nunconfirmed allegations of UNRWA collusion with Hamas fighters and as part of\nefforts to assess whether the agency was doing everything within its power to\nensure neutrality.\n\n### Humanitarians locked in aid delivery \u2018dance\u2019 to avert famine in Gaza\n\n16 April 2024\n\nHumanitarian Aid\n\nScaling up assistance in Gaza remains a challenge in the face of continued\naccess denials, delays and other impediments, the head of the UN humanitarian\naffairs office (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territories said on Tuesday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Print Email\n\n", "frontpage": false}
