Microsoft and IBM have joined forces to open-source the 1988\noperating system MS-DOS 4.0 under the MIT License. Why? Well, why not?\n\nAs Scott Hanselman, Microsoft's VP of the developer community, and Jeff\nWilcox, head of Microsoft's Open Source Programs Office, recount in\nMicrosoft's Open Source Blog, \"a young English researcher named Connor\n'Starfrost' Hyde corresponded recently with former Microsoft Chief Technical\nOfficer Ray Ozzie\" about the relationship between DOS 4, Multitasking DOS (MT-\nDOS), and what would become IBM and Microsoft's OS/2.\n\nAlso: Ubuntu 24.04: This great new Linux distro isn't just fast - it's a\nfortress\n\nThat got Hanselman and Wilcox digging into the Microsoft archives. The blog\npost continues: \"While they were unable to find the full source code for MT-\nDOS, they did find MS-DOS 4.00, which we're releasing today, alongside these\nadditional beta binaries, PDFs of the documentation, and disk images.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Microsoft has released MS-DOS source code. Back in\n2014, Microsoft open-sourced the MS-DOS source code for versions 1.25 and 2.0\nvia the Computer History Museum.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nOther DOS versions have also been open-sourced over the years. PC-MOS/386, a\nmulti-user MS-DOS clone by Norcross, GA-based The Software Link, was open-\nsourced in 2017. It ran most standard DOS and 386's protected mode\napplications.\n\nIndeed, it was a better DOS operating system than MS-DOS 4.0. For those of you\nwho weren't running it in 1988 -- when The Cosby Show and Roseanne were the\nmost popular TV shows in the States and Joe Montanna was leading the San\nFrancisco 49ers to their third Super Bowl win -- MS-DOS 4.0 was an awful\noperating system.\n\nAlso: If all kernel bugs are security bugs, how do you keep your Linux safe?\n\nHow awful? Popular programs of the day -- such as WordPerfect 5.1, Lotus\n1-2-3, and Doom -- always broke on it. You'd be in the middle of a task, and,\nbang, your program would freeze completely. Long before we got to know and\nhate Windows' Blue Screen of Death, MS-DOS 4.0 horrified PC users.\n\nThat was mainly because MS-DOS 4.0 used an enormous 92KB of RAM. Today, you\nwouldn't notice that much RAM being used on your watch. But back in the day,\nwhen 640K was what you got on a high-end PC, it was a big deal. It used more\nmemory than any other version of DOS before or since.\n\nPC users either returned to MS-DOS 3.3, which I recommended at the time, or\nmoved to Digital Research's DR-DOS 3.41.\n\nHow bad was MS-DOS 4? DR-DOS version numbers had started off mimicking MS-DOS\nversion numbers to show that the former would work just like the latter. But\nthere was no DR-DOS 4.0. Instead, Digital Research named its new 1989 version\nDR-DOS 5.0 to prevent anyone from thinking that it had any connection with MS-\nDOS 4.0.\n\nAlso: When Windows 10 support runs out, you have 5 options but only 2 are\nworth considering\n\nIndeed, perhaps one reason so many people were ready to try a new Unix-like\noperating system, Linux, in 1991 was that MS-DOS 4.0 had annoyed so many\nusers.\n\nToday, you can download the MS-DOS 4.0 source code and run it for yourself on\nan original IBM PC XT (surely someone has one still running somewhere), a\nnewer Pentium, and with the open-source PCem and 86box emulators. It might\nalso work with Oracle VirtualBox or the old Linux MS-DOS virtual machine\nDOSEMU, but I haven't had a chance to check it.\n\n#### More Microsoft\n\nThe best Windows laptop models: Comparing Dell, Samsung, Lenovo, and more\n\nWindows 11's big new update is full of AI and rolling out today - here's\nwhat's in it\n\nHow to upgrade Windows Home edition to Pro\n\n5 Microsoft Edge settings to change for more secure browsing than Chrome\noffers\n\nHere's the best way to upgrade to Windows 11 Pro, and why you should\n\n  * The best Windows laptop models: Comparing Dell, Samsung, Lenovo, and more\n\n  * Windows 11's big new update is full of AI and rolling out today - here's what's in it\n\n  * How to upgrade Windows Home edition to Pro\n\n  * 5 Microsoft Edge settings to change for more secure browsing than Chrome offers\n\n  * Here's the best way to upgrade to Windows 11 Pro, and why you should\n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment Community Guidelines\n\nx\n\nplayer version| 3.2.1  \n---|---  \nplayback state| -1  \ntransition state| start  \n  \n00:00 00:00 Live\n\nLearn More\n\n### Related\n\n### Don't like your Linux desktop?
