For such an\nentity, dubbed \u201cLaplace\u2019s demon\u201d by subsequent commentators, there would be no\nmystery about what had happened in the past or what would happen at any time\nin the future. According to the clockwork universe described by Isaac Newton,\nthe past and future are exactly determined by the present.\n\nLaplace\u2019s demon was never supposed to be a practical thought experiment; the\nimagined intelligence would have to be essentially as vast as the universe\nitself. And in practice, chaotic dynamics can amplify tiny imperfections in\nthe initial knowledge of the system into complete uncertainty later on. But in\nprinciple, Newtonian mechanics is deterministic.\n\nA century later, quantum mechanics changed everything. Ordinary physical\ntheories tell you what a system is and how it evolves over time. Quantum\nmechanics does this as well, but it also comes with an entirely new set of\nrules, governing what happens when systems are observed or measured. Most\nnotably, measurement outcomes cannot be predicted with perfect confidence,\neven in principle. The best we can do is to calculate the probability of\nobtaining each possible outcome, according to what\u2019s called the Born rule: The\nwave function assigns an \u201camplitude\u201d to each measurement outcome, and the\nprobability of getting that result is equal to the amplitude squared. This\nfeature is what led Albert Einstein to complain about God playing dice with\nthe universe.\n\nResearchers continue to argue over the best way to think about quantum\nmechanics. There are competing schools of thought, which are sometimes\nreferred to as \u201cinterpretations\u201d of quantum theory but are better thought of\nas distinct physical theories that give the same predictions in the regimes we\nhave tested so far. All of them share the feature that they lean on the idea\nof probability in a fundamental way. Which raises the question: What is\n\u201cprobability,\u201d really?\n\n## Quantized Columns\n\nA regular column in which top researchers explore the process of discovery.\nThis month\u2019s columnist, Sean Carroll, is a research professor of theoretical\nphysics at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nSee all Quantized Columns\n\nLike many subtle concepts, probability starts out with a seemingly\nstraightforward, commonsensical meaning, which becomes trickier the closer we\nlook at it. You flip a fair coin many times; whether it comes up heads or\ntails on any particular trial is completely unknown, but if we perform many\ntrials we expect to get heads 50% of the time and tails 50% of the time. We\ntherefore say that the probability of obtaining heads is 50%, and likewise for\ntails.\n\nWe know how to handle the mathematics of probability, thanks to the work of\nthe Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov and others. Probabilities are real\nnumbers between zero and one, inclusive; the probabilities of all independent\nevents add up to one; and so on. But that\u2019s not the same as deciding what\nprobability actually is.\n\nThere are numerous approaches to defining probability, but we can distinguish\nbetween two broad classes. The \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201cphysical\u201d view treats\nprobability as a fundamental feature of a system, the best way we have to\ncharacterize physical behavior. An example of an objective approach to\nprobability is frequentism, which defines probability as the frequency with\nwhich things happen over many trials, as in our coin-tossing example.\n\nAlternatively, there are \u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cevidential\u201d views, which treat\nprobability as personal, a reflection of an individual\u2019s credence, or degree\nof belief, about what is true or what will happen. An example is Bayesian\nprobability, which emphasizes Bayes\u2019 law, a mathematical theorem that tells us\nhow to update our credences as we obtain new information. Bayesians imagine\nthat rational creatures in states of incomplete information walk around with\ncredences for every proposition you can imagine, updating them continually as\nnew data comes in. In contrast with frequentism, in Bayesianism it makes\nperfect sense to attach probabilities to one-shot events, such as who will win\nthe next election, or even past events that we\u2019re unsure about.\n\nInterestingly, different approaches to quantum mechanics invoke different\nmeanings of probability in central ways. Thinking about quantum mechanics\nhelps illuminate probability, and vice versa. Or, to put it more\npessimistically: Quantum mechanics as it is currently understood doesn\u2019t\nreally help us choose between competing conceptions of probability, as every\nconception has a home in some quantum formulation or other.\n\nLet\u2019s consider three of the leading approaches to quantum theory. There are\n\u201cdynamical collapse\u201d theories, such as the GRW model proposed in 1985 by\nGiancarlo Ghirardi, Alberto Rimini and Tullio Weber. There are \u201cpilot wave\u201d or\n\u201chidden variable\u201d approaches, most notably the de Broglie-Bohm theory,\ninvented by David Bohm in 1952 based on earlier ideas from Louis de Broglie.\nAnd there is the \u201cmany worlds\u201d formulation suggested by Hugh Everett in 1957.\n\nEach of these represents a way of solving the measurement problem of quantum\nmechanics. The problem is that conventional quantum theory describes the state\nof a system in terms of a wave function, which evolves smoothly and\ndeterministically according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. At least, it does\nunless the system is being observed; in that case, according to the textbook\npresentation, the wave function suddenly \u201ccollapses\u201d into some particular\nobservational outcome. The collapse itself is unpredictable; the wave function\nassigns a number to each possible outcome, and the probability of observing\nthat outcome is equal to the value of the wave function squared. The\nmeasurement problem is simply: What constitutes a \u201cmeasurement\u201d? When exactly\ndoes it occur? Why are measurements seemingly different from ordinary\nevolution?\n\nCarroll\u2019s most recent book is Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the\nEmergence of Spacetime.\n\nDynamical-collapse theories offer perhaps the most straightforward resolution\nto the measurement problem. They posit that there is a truly random component\nto quantum evolution, according to which every particle usually obeys the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, but occasionally its wave function will spontaneously\nlocalize at some position in space. Such collapses are so rare that we would\nnever observe one for a single particle, but in a macroscopic object made of\nmany particles, collapses happen all the time. This prevents macroscopic\nobjects \u2014 like the cat in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s infamous thought experiment \u2014 from\nevolving into an observable superposition. All the particles in a large system\nwill be entangled with each other, so that when just one of them localizes in\nspace, the rest are brought along for the ride.\n\nProbability in such models is fundamental and objective. There is absolutely\nnothing about the present that precisely determines the future. Dynamical-\ncollapse theories fit perfectly into an old-fashioned frequentist view of\nprobability. What happens next is unknowable, and all we can say is what the\nlong-term frequency of different outcomes will be. Laplace\u2019s demon wouldn\u2019t be\nable to exactly predict the future, even if it knew the present state of the\nuniverse exactly.\n\nPilot-wave theories tell a very different story. Here, nothing is truly\nrandom; the quantum state evolves deterministically, just as the classical\nstate did for Newton. The new element is the concept of hidden variables, such\nas the actual positions of particles, in addition to the traditional wave\nfunction. The particles are what we actually observe, while the wave function\nserves merely to guide them.\n\nIn a sense, pilot-wave theories bring us back to the clockwork universe of\nclassical mechanics, but with an important twist: When we\u2019re not making an\nobservation, we don\u2019t, and can\u2019t, know the actual values of the hidden\nvariables. We can prepare a wave function so that we know it exactly, but we\nonly learn about the hidden variables by observing them. The best we can do is\nto admit our ignorance and introduce a probability distribution over their\npossible values.\n\nProbability in pilot-wave theories, in other words, is entirely subjective. It\ncharacterizes our knowledge, not an objective frequency of occurrences over\ntime. A full-powered Laplace demon that knew both the wave function and all\nthe hidden variables could predict the future exactly, but a hobbled version\nthat only knew the wave function would still have to make probabilistic\npredictions.\n\nThen we have many-worlds. This is my personal favorite approach to quantum\nmechanics, but it\u2019s also the one for which it is most challenging to pinpoint\nhow and why probability enters the game.\n\nMany-worlds quantum mechanics has the simplest formulation of all the\nalternatives. There is a wave function, and it obeys Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation,\nand that\u2019s all. There are no collapses and no additional variables. Instead,\nwe use Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation to predict what will happen when an observer\nmeasures a quantum object in a superposition of multiple possible states. The\nanswer is that the combined system of observer and object evolves into an\nentangled superposition. In each part of the superposition, the object has a\ndefinite measurement outcome and the observer has measured that outcome.\n\nEverett\u2019s brilliant move was simply to say, \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay\u201d \u2014 all we need to\ndo is recognize that each part of the system subsequently evolves separately\nfrom all of the others, and therefore qualifies as a separate branch of the\nwave function, or \u201cworld.\u201d The worlds aren\u2019t put in by hand; they were lurking\nin the quantum formalism all along.\n\nThe idea of all those worlds might seem extravagant or distasteful, but those\naren\u2019t respectable scientific objections. A more legitimate question is the\nnature of probability within this approach. In many-worlds, we can know the\nwave function exactly, and it evolves deterministically. There is nothing\nunknown or unpredictable. Laplace\u2019s demon could predict the entire future of\nthe universe with perfect confidence. How is probability involved at all?\n\nAn answer is provided by the idea of \u201cself-locating,\u201d or \u201cindexical,\u201d\nuncertainty. Imagine that you are about to measure a quantum system, thus\nbranching the wave function into different worlds (for simplicity, let\u2019s just\nsay there will be two worlds). It doesn\u2019t make sense to ask, \u201cAfter the\nmeasurement, which world will I be on?\u201d There will be two people, one on each\nbranch, both descended from you; neither has a better claim to being \u201creally\nyou\u201d than the other.\n\nBut even if both people know the wave function of the universe, there is now\nsomething they don\u2019t know: which branch of the wave function they are on.\nThere will inevitably be a period of time after branching occurs but before\nthe observers find out what outcome was obtained on their branch. They don\u2019t\nknow where they are in the wave function. That\u2019s self-locating uncertainty, as\nfirst emphasized in the quantum context by the physicist Lev Vaidman.\n\nYou might think you could just look at the experimental outcome really\nquickly, so that there was no noticeable period of uncertainty. But in the\nreal world, the wave function branches incredibly fast, on timescales of\n10^\u221221 seconds or less. That\u2019s far quicker than a signal can even reach your\nbrain. There will always be some period of time when you\u2019re on a certain\nbranch of the wave function, but you don\u2019t know which one.\n\nCan we resolve this uncertainty in a sensible way? Yes, we can, as Charles\nSebens and I have argued, and doing so leads precisely to the Born rule: The\ncredence you should attach to being on any particular branch of the wave\nfunction is just the amplitude squared for that branch, just as in ordinary\nquantum mechanics. Sebens and I needed to make a new assumption, which we\ncalled the \u201cepistemic separability principle\u201d: Whatever predictions you make\nfor experimental outcomes, they should be unaltered if we only change the wave\nfunction for completely separate parts of the system.\n\nSelf-locating uncertainty is a different kind of epistemic uncertainty from\nthat featured in pilot-wave models. You can know everything there is to know\nabout the universe, and there\u2019s still something you\u2019re uncertain about, namely\nwhere you personally are within it. Your uncertainty obeys the rules of\nordinary probability, but it requires a bit of work to convince yourself that\nthere\u2019s a reasonable way to assign numbers to your belief.\n\nYou might object that you want to make predictions now, even before branching\nhappens. Then there\u2019s nothing uncertain; you know exactly how the universe\nwill evolve. But included in that knowledge is the conviction that all the\nfuture versions of yourself will be uncertain, and they should use the Born\nrule to assign credences to the various branches they could be on. In that\ncase, it makes sense to act precisely as if you live in a truly stochastic\nuniverse, with the frequency of various outcomes given by the Born rule.\n(David Deutsch and David Wallace have made this argument rigorous using\ndecision theory.)\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### New Quantum Paradox Clarifies Where Our Views of Reality Go Wrong\n\n  2. ### Why the Many-Worlds Interpretation Has Many Problems\n\n  3. ### Famous Experiment Dooms Alternative to Quantum Weirdness\n\n  4. ### Quantum Theory Rebuilt From Simple Physical Principles\n\n  5. ### A Private View of Quantum Reality\n\nIn one sense, all of these notions of probability can be thought of as\nversions of self-locating uncertainty. All we have to do is consider the set\nof all possible worlds \u2014 all the different versions of reality one could\npossibly conceive. Some such worlds obey the rules of dynamical-collapse\ntheories, and each of these is distinguished by the actual sequence of\noutcomes for all the quantum measurements ever performed. Other worlds are\ndescribed by pilot-wave theories, and in each one the hidden variables have\ndifferent values. Still others are many-worlds realities, where agents are\nuncertain about which branch of the wave function they are on. We might think\nof the role of probability as expressing our personal credences about which of\nthese possible worlds is the actual one.\n\nThe study of probability takes us from coin flipping to branching universes.\nHopefully our understanding of this tricky concept will progress hand in hand\nwith our understanding of quantum mechanics itself.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nBy Sean Carroll\n\nContributing Columnist\n\nSeptember 9, 2019\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nmany worldsphysicspilot-wave theoryprobabilityQuantized Columnsquantum\ninterpretationsquantum physicsAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Physics\n\nfundamental physics\n\n### Hopes of Big Bang Discoveries Ride on a Future Spacecraft\n\nBy Elise Cutts\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\ngeometry\n\n### Geometers Engineer New Tools to Wrangle Spacecraft Orbits\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\nThe Joy of Why\n\n### Can Information Escape a Black Hole?\n\nBy Janna Levin\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
