Congratulations! But what do you actually do?\n\nIt often goes like this: it\u2019s day one and you\u2019re pumped. You have that fancy\noffice/conf room! But as you go through meetings, your mood changes. You find\nthat the organization is large and complex. Multiple teams and leads are vying\nfor your attention and you can\u2019t even keep their names straight. You\u2019re are\nalso detecting whiffs of trouble: projects in trouble and people who don\u2019t\nlike each other. A sister organization seems to be eyeing your turf. Your CEO\nchecks in with you at the end of the day \u2013 \u201cHow are things? All good? Super\nexcited you\u2019re here.\u201d. You nervously type out a \u201cAll good!\u201d but you\u2019re\nsecretly worried whether you\u2019ll survive your first three months.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick playbook I\u2019ve compiled over the years on how to make the most\nof your first month. A lot of this is from personal experience and advice from\nleaders who have done this well.\n\nFirst, relax! Every senior leader I\u2019ve met has been through a similar\nexperience when they\u2019ve been promoted into a new role. These jobs are not easy\nand every single person struggles with impostor syndrome.\n\nSecond, meet everyone. Spend your first two weeks doing only 1:1 meetings and\nbeing a quiet observer in team meetings. In every meeting, cover these three\ntopics and do as less talking as possible:\n\n  * understand that person and how they fit into the org\n  * three things they feel are going well and three that are not going well/need fixing\n  * At the very end of the meeting, ask for a couple of names for people you should meet\n\nWhen you walk out of the 1:1, write up what you heard and set up meetings with\nthe people they suggested, even if they\u2019re outside your org.\n\nYou\u2019ll quickly build a mental map of common themes that emerge. Project X and\nY which seem to be in trouble. Person Z who everyone thinks is awesome but is\njust some junior data scientist in title and should probably be promoted.\nCompensation issues. Space issues. Within two weeks you should have a list of\nthree things the org needs to change and three things the org needs to double\ndown on/accelerate.\n\nYou\u2019re also laying the ground work for relationships and information flow\nacross the org which will be critical later on where the same people may not\nbe as open with you as they are with a new person.\n\nThird, make obvious people changes quickly.\n\nWithin the first few weeks, it should be apparent which parts of your team are\nworking and which aren\u2019t. If you need to make an obvious change and ask\nsomeone to leave or change their role, it\u2019s better to do it early and quickly.\nYou\u2019ll find people expect you to do this with your fresh slate than having to\ndo it eight months later.\n\nThis can feel very hard. You have barely gotten started and you may not even\nknow the other person well. However, you\u2019ll always find that these situations\nare obvious and the org is almost expecting you to do it (and will judge your\nstandards if you don\u2019t).\n\nFourth, build key relationships.\n\nThere are three sets of key relationships you\u2019ll need and in the first few\nweeks, spend time on all of these: Your direct reports, your peers and your\nmanager. Your directs come first \u2013 they rely on you for their career\nprogression and are your biggest responsibility. Take them to dinner, have\ncoffee with them. Get to know them as people and not just in the confines of\ntheir role.\n\nThe most important however is your boss: the CEO or someone reporting to\nhim/her usually. Check in with them at all times. Pass on your observations\nand get theirs in return. Calibrate whether this resonates with them and more\nimportantly, get to alignment on what they think success in your job looks\nlike. Ideally you\u2019re chatting every few days. Most new exec failures are\nbecause there\u2019s no early alignment.\n\nFifth, pick a crisis/early win\n\nI can\u2019t emphasize this enough. One of the most crucial things for new leaders\nis having an early \u201cwin\u201d where the team sees you roll up your sleeves and in\naction. This could mean any number of things \u2013 close that sale yourself,\nhandle that incoming press/PR kerfuffle, personally get involved in that site\noutage. Whatever it is, it is key that people get to see you engage \u2013 your\nstyle, how you actually do the work and add value.\n\nI\u2019ve seen many senior execs hope for a good crisis where they can help the\nteam. The easiest thing to do IMO is pick a quick/small project (not something\nthat will take months) where you can have a visible win/outcome and justify\nyour role as opposed to being just another layer of management.\n\nIn many cases, I\u2019ve seen people form their impression of leaders for years\nbased on this first impression.\n\nDon\u2019t mess it up.\n\nSixth, communicate.\n\nEvery single week, write out an update to your entire org on the people you\u2019ve\nmet and some high level observations. Write about yourself and your journey.\nPeople want to hear from their leaders and you\u2019ll be surprised how little they\nknow of what you actually do all day. Writing is by far the best way to get\nthem to know you.\n\nThe key here is consistency. Send it to the same google group/alias at the\nsame time of week with the same structure.\n\nFinally, at the end of the month, write up a document on everything you\nobserved from step two and send it to the org along with a few themes you want\nto focus on. This can feel uncomfortable \u2013 most execs aren\u2019t used to being\ntransparent so broadly. However, there\u2019s real value here. The org gets to see\nhow you work transparently but also have a mirror shined back on them from an\nunbiased source. I often find these docs are valuable years after the fact and\ngood ones are the key to changing org behavior and culture.\n\nAnd...that\u2019s it! These can sound trivial but you\u2019ll be surprised at how\nrepeatable and applicable this playbook is across job types and industries.\nRemember \u2013 these jobs are hard but you\u2019ve earned it for a reason. Trust\nyourself, have fun. And send me a note on how it goes!\n\nThere are many people who have given me advice on this over the years but in\nparticular I want to thank: Boz, Adam Bain and Gokul Rajaram. The book \u201cFirst\n90 Days\u201d has also been a huge help\n\n## Discover more from Sriram Krishnan\n\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\nContinue reading\n\n", "frontpage": false}
