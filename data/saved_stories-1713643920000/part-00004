In\ndoing so, we encountered the inevitable think pieces about how \u2018data is the\nnew oil\u2019. In fact, the phrase continues to appear in government consultations\nand Parliament to this day. In this piece we dive into why the analogy is\nmisleading.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to brush this off, language matters, and the forms of short-\nhand we use have an outsized impact on how we perceive the world.\n\nThis is only heightened when we approach the new and the unfamiliar. The\nnumber of AI-related analogies has exploded considerably in the past few\nyears. At the same time, advances in capabilities have created a new\ngeneration of AI-first companies that are fighting to position themselves in\nemerging markets.\n\nBoth these trends shed some light on the promise and perils of analogies and\nprovide lessons for policymakers and entrepreneurs alike.\n\n###\n\nOil, parrots, and Shoggoth\n\nComparisons between data and oil have been used to make points about a range\nof issues from geopolitics and antitrust through to the environmental impact\nof AI and the value of data.\n\nThe analogy never made much sense. Unlike oil, the following is true of data\n(and by extension AI):\n\n  * It\u2019s a growing, not an expendable resource;\n\n  * Its routinely reused;\n\n  * Synthetic variants are easy to generate in a scalable way thanks to LLMs;\n\n  * Obtaining or creating it is not a high risk, capital intensive business. Moving or copying it has little marginal cost;\n\n  * The price has only ever trended downwards, due to growth in supply, lowered storage and transmission costs, and cheaper compute;\n\n  * The geopolitical advantage remains hypothetical.\n\nAs well as being a bad analogy in and of itself, it conjured up a number of\nunhelpful associations from a policy standpoint.\n\nFirstly, a scarcity mindset. Data became innately precious, a source of\nstrategic advantage in and of itself, to be guarded through localisation laws.\nIn the UK, government and activist groups began assigning implausibly high\nvalue to the data held by the country\u2019s National Health Service, contributing\nto a reluctance to share it with potential private technology parties.\n\nSecondly, it fuelled a number of distorted but influential assumptions about\nAI and geopolitics. Kai-Fu Lee emerged as the leader of this camp, arguing\nthat as the \u201cSaudi Arabia of data\u201d, China had an innate advantage in the AI\nrace. This analogy was always shaky. Oil gives Saudi Arabia leverage, but not\nglobal leadership, and much of this lies in its ability to control supply (to\nprint money). This clearly is not the case with China and data. However, these\nsnappy arguments drowned out the more sophisticated voices pointing out the\nrelationship between volume of data and advantage in specific domains of\nstrategic importance isn\u2019t always clear cut.\n\nThe challenge with these phrases is that they simultaneously sound meaningful\n(they trigger associations), while lacking any specific stable meaning (the\nassociations are largely subjective). When the data scientist Clive Humby\nfirst said \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d at a marketing summit in 2006, he was making\na relatively banal point about how data needed to be refined before it was\nuseful. The dozens of permutations and interpretations all came later.\n\nIn a similar way, we often see the phrase \u2019stochastic parrot\u2019 thrown around by\npeople expressing skepticism about the capabilities or significance of LLMs.\nAt a recent event, a senior member of the national security community actually\ntold us that the government didn\u2019t need to engage closely with the technology\nas \u201cit\u2019s just a stochastic parrot\u201d. As well as being a poor analogy that\ndoesn\u2019t account for emergent capabilities, it\u2019s been routinely ... parroted\nwith little regard for its origins. The authors of the original stochastic\nparrot paper never argued that LLMs lacked power or relevance, the concern was\nthat their lack of reasoning ability made them actively dangerous, precisely\nbecause they were powerful.\n\nWhen we get to the frontier and increasingly think ahead to hypothetical\nfuture capabilities, the lure of colorful shorthand becomes even stronger.\nWhile few people in the AI world were sad to see the death of the 2016-2019\nera Terminator comparisons, its successors weren\u2019t improvements and have\ncontributed to an irrational, vibes-driven conversation about safety. \u2018God-\nlike AI\u2019, which helped fuel x-risk panic in the corridors of power, fell into\nthe category of sounding meaningful but lacking specificity. Whereas, on\ncloser inspection, \u2018Shoggoth\u2019 memes appear to be a darker manifestation of\n\u2018stochastic parrots\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing this play out in the governance debate, with calls for an\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for AI\u2019 implicitly evoking\ncomparisons between advanced AI and nuclear. Not only is the way AI developed\ncompletely different (highly decentralized, overwhelmingly by private actors),\nit places a hypothetical armageddon at the center of the conversation. This\ndoes not frame the discussion in a balanced or constructive way.\n\n###\n\nDoes it matter?\n\nMatthijs Maas of the Centre for Law & AI published a paper last year that\npersuasively made the case that popular metaphors had shaped policymakers\u2019\nresponse to technology throughout history. The framing of the internet as\n\u2018cyberspace\u2019 led the US military to view it as another \u2018domain\u2019 of conflict,\nalong with the land, sea, air, and space and was used to support the creation\nof US Cyber Command.\n\nOn the legal front, tech companies have fought off calls to hold them\nresponsible for the content they host by arguing that, like newspapers\u2019\neditorial choices, they are protected speech. We\u2019re currently seeing a fresh\n\u2018battle of the analogies\u2019 taking off in copyright disputes around generative\nmodels, with Stable Diffusion and Midjourney being accused of building\n\u201csophisticated collage tools, with the output representing nothing more than a\nmash-up of training data\u201d.\n\nFrom law through to military strategy, it turns out words matter very much.\n\n###\n\nChatGPT for analogies\n\nThe temptation of the easy analogy isn\u2019t just a challenge for policy-makers.\nIt\u2019s equally dangerous for entrepreneurs.\n\nIn our line of work, we encounter thousands of ideas a year - whether it\u2019s a\npitch deck, a LinkedIn profile, or a snatched conversation at a meet-up (our\nevents page is here). The single most lackluster thing anyone can say is that\nthey\u2019re building a \u201cChatGPT for X\u201d.\n\nDefining what you\u2019re building by reference to somebody else\u2019s product is a\nsign to investors and customers that you lack confidence. By definition,\nyou\u2019re starting a conversation by saying what you\u2019re not working on. It also\nties perceptions of your company to someone else\u2019s brand, which by definition\nyou cannot control. If GPT-5 disappoints an expectant world, while Claude 4\nstuns us, do you hurriedly re-do your elevator pitch?\n\nThere is precedent for this. Many readers will remember the 2016-2018\nenthusiasm for the \u201cUber for X\u201d model of positioning that followed on from the\nlong-forgotten \u201cFacebook for X\u201d era.\n\nIn fact, when we look back at Uber\u2019s original pitch deck from 2008, they fell\ninto the same trap:\n\nIf Uber had launched as \u201cthe NetJets of Limos\u201d we would likely never have\nheard from it again. Fortunately, they went in a different direction and\npositioned themselves boldly, without reference to the incumbents they were\ndisrupting:\n\nIf we consider the companies we admire, they never do this. Lambda Automata\ndon\u2019t describe themselves as the \u2018BAE Systems for AI\u2019 or \u2018Anduril but\nEuropean\u2019. Similarly, our friends at Profluent don\u2019t tell the world they\u2019re\nbuilding the ChatGPT for proteins.\n\nIn much the same way that hazy reasoning distorts policy, it can also lead to\nbad strategy. The \u201cUber for X\u201d businesses largely failed, whether it was Uber\nfor meal ingredients, laundry, parking spaces, car washes or home repairs.\nThis was partly down to market conditions, but also I believe because the\nsnappy shorthand obscured what made Uber successful. Many interpreted the Uber\nformula as \u201cservice people find useful but on an app\u201d. This skipped out\nmultiple layers of complexity.\n\nUber took something:\n\n  * That was a commodity, where there\u2019s only limited variation in skill or user need - taxi rides;\n\n  * Where immediacy was genuinely important - no one likes missing a flight or being stood in the rain;\n\n  * Where the existing market was inefficient - demand spikes weren\u2019t consistently matched with under-utilized supply.\n\nInstead, many of these start-ups focused on more specialized services, where\nuser need or the skill of the provider genuinely varied, or targeted non-real\npain points. They\u2019d not understood Uber at all.\n\n###\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nAbolishing all short-hand would be both impossible and profoundly undesirable.\nIt\u2019s incredibly useful to be able to refer to a complex or unfamiliar concept\nby reference to something known. However, policymakers, investors,\nentrepreneurs, and others would be better served by doing this more\nselectively.\n\nThis could mean using analogies or comparisons for individual features, while\navoiding lazy totalising short-hand. In the policy world, it involves\naccepting that there isn\u2019t a comprehensive or perfect analogy for advanced AI.\nSome future capabilities might seem \u2018God-like\u2019 while Shoggoth can remind us\nthat reinforcement learning from human feedback should be approached with\ncaution.\n\nYou may not want to call your product \u201cChatGPT for X\u201d, but it\u2019s perfectly\nreasonable to say that, for instance, users would see a familiar ChatGPT-style\ninterface. Alongside help with hiring, marketing, and product, we work closely\nwith founders on story-telling precisely because these nuances matter. Either\nway, a founder should be the chief evangelist for their company, which means\nhaving the courage to chart their own course, simplify the complex, and\nconvince other people that it matters.\n\nShare\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Data, oil, Uber and the peril of easy analogies\n\npress.airstreet.com\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n1 Comment\n\nZaphod BeelbebroxApr 11Shoggoths, are less a darker manifestation of\nstochastic parrot, and more a digital incarnation of an actively malicious\nactor.Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nData acquisition strategies for AI-first start-ups\n\nBack in 2016, I came across a prescient guide on data acquisition strategies\nfor AI startups written by Moritz Mueller-Freitag, then co-founder of...\n\nApr 4 \u2022\n\nAir Street Capital\n\n,\n\nNathan Benaich\n\n,\n\nMoritz Mueller-Freitag\n\n, and\n\nAlex Chalmers\n\n11\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Data acquisition strategies for AI-first start-ups\n\npress.airstreet.com\n\n2\n\nThe State of State of AI Report\n\nIntroduction The State of AI Report is our comprehensive round-up of the most\nimportant developments of the year in AI research, industry, safety, and...\n\nFeb 1 \u2022\n\nAir Street Capital\n\nand\n\nNathan Benaich\n\n10\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The State of State of AI Report\n\npress.airstreet.com\n\nThe Case for Open Source AI\n\nArm the rebels\n\nFeb 8 \u2022\n\nAir Street Capital\n\n,\n\nNathan Benaich\n\n, and\n\nAlex Chalmers\n\n15\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Case for Open Source AI\n\npress.airstreet.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Air Street Capital Management Ltd.\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
