Now, thanks to a\nnew, immersive visualization produced on a NASA supercomputer, viewers can\nplunge into the event horizon, a black hole\u2019s point of no return.\n\nIn this visualization of a flight toward a supermassive black hole, labels\nhighlight many of the fascinating features produced by the effects of general\nrelativity along the way. Produced on a NASA supercomputer, the simulation\ntracks a camera as it approaches, briefly orbits, and then crosses the event\nhorizon \u2014 the point of no return \u2014 of a monster black hole much like the one\nat the center of our galaxy.

Powell\n\nView the plunge in 360 video on YouTube\n\n\u201cPeople often ask about this, and simulating these difficult-to-imagine\nprocesses helps me connect the mathematics of relativity to actual\nconsequences in the real universe,\u201d said Jeremy Schnittman, an astrophysicist\nat NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who created the\nvisualizations. \u201cSo I simulated two different scenarios, one where a camera \u2014\na stand-in for a daring astronaut \u2014 just misses the event horizon and\nslingshots back out, and one where it crosses the boundary, sealing its fate.\u201d\n\nThe visualizations are available in multiple forms. Explainer videos act as\nsightseeing guides, illuminating the bizarre effects of Einstein\u2019s general\ntheory of relativity. Versions rendered as 360-degree videos let viewers look\nall around during the trip, while others play as flat all-sky maps.\n\nTo create the visualizations, Schnittman teamed up with fellow Goddard\nscientist Brian Powell and used the Discover supercomputer at the NASA Center\nfor Climate Simulation. The project generated about 10 terabytes of data \u2014\nequivalent to roughly half of the estimated text content in the Library of\nCongress \u2014 and took about 5 days running on just 0.3% of Discover\u2019s 129,000\nprocessors. The same feat would take more than a decade on a typical laptop.\n\nThe destination is a supermassive black hole with 4.3 million times the mass\nof our Sun, equivalent to the monster located at the center of our Milky Way\ngalaxy.\n\n\u201cIf you have the choice, you want to fall into a supermassive black hole,\u201d\nSchnittman explained. \u201cStellar-mass black holes, which contain up to about 30\nsolar masses, possess much smaller event horizons and stronger tidal forces,\nwhich can rip apart approaching objects before they get to the horizon.\u201d\n\nThis occurs because the gravitational pull on the end of an object nearer the\nblack hole is much stronger than that on the other end. Infalling objects\nstretch out like noodles, a process astrophysicists call spaghettification.\n\nThe simulated black hole\u2019s event horizon spans about 16 million miles (25\nmillion kilometers), or about 17% of the distance from Earth to the Sun. A\nflat, swirling cloud of hot, glowing gas called an accretion disk surrounds it\nand serves as a visual reference during the fall. So do glowing structures\ncalled photon rings, which form closer to the black hole from light that has\norbited it one or more times. A backdrop of the starry sky as seen from Earth\ncompletes the scene.\n\nTour an alternative visualization that tracks a camera as it approaches, falls\ntoward, briefly orbits, and escapes a supermassive black hole.

Powell\n\nView the flyby explainer on YouTube\n\nAs the camera approaches the black hole, reaching speeds ever closer to that\nof light itself, the glow from the accretion disk and background stars becomes\namplified in much the same way as the sound of an oncoming racecar rises in\npitch. Their light appears brighter and whiter when looking into the direction\nof travel.\n\nThe movies begin with the camera located nearly 400 million miles (640 million\nkilometers) away, with the black hole quickly filling the view. Along the way,\nthe black hole\u2019s disk, photon rings, and the night sky become increasingly\ndistorted \u2014 and even form multiple images as their light traverses the\nincreasingly warped space-time.\n\nIn real time, the camera takes about 3 hours to fall to the event horizon,\nexecuting almost two complete 30-minute orbits along the way. But to anyone\nobserving from afar, it would never quite get there. As space-time becomes\never more distorted closer to the horizon, the image of the camera would slow\nand then seem to freeze just shy of it. This is why astronomers originally\nreferred to black holes as \u201cfrozen stars.\u201d\n\nAt the event horizon, even space-time itself flows inward at the speed of\nlight, the cosmic speed limit. Once inside it, both the camera and the space-\ntime in which it's moving rush toward the black hole's center \u2014 a one-\ndimensional point called a singularity, where the laws of physics as we know\nthem cease to operate.\n\n\u201cOnce the camera crosses the horizon, its destruction by spaghettification is\njust 12.8 seconds away,\u201d Schnittman said. From there, it\u2019s only 79,500 miles\n(128,000 kilometers) to the singularity. This final leg of the voyage is over\nin the blink of an eye.\n\nIn the alternative scenario, the camera orbits close to the event horizon but\nit never crosses over and escapes to safety. If an astronaut flew a spacecraft\non this 6-hour round trip while her colleagues on a mothership remained far\nfrom the black hole, she\u2019d return 36 minutes younger than her colleagues.\nThat\u2019s because time passes more slowly near a strong gravitational source and\nwhen moving near the speed of light.\n\n\u201cThis situation can be even more extreme,\u201d Schnittman noted. \u201cIf the black\nhole were rapidly rotating, like the one shown in the 2014 movie\n\u2018Interstellar,\u2019 she would return many years younger than her shipmates.\u201d\n\nDownload high-resolution video and images from NASA\u2019s Scientific Visualization\nStudio\n\nBy Francis Reddy NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\n\nMedia Contact: Claire Andreoli 301-286-1940 claire.andreoli@nasa.gov NASA\u2019s\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\n\n## Share\n\n## Details\n\nLast Updated\n\nMay 06, 2024\n\nEditor\n\nFrancis Reddy\n\nLocation\n\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\n## Related Terms\n\n  * Astrophysics\n  * Black Holes\n  * Galaxies, Stars, & Black Holes\n  * Galaxies, Stars, & Black Holes Research\n  * Goddard Space Flight Center\n  * Supermassive Black Holes\n  * The Universe\n\n## Explore More\n\n10 min read\n\n### Ken Carpenter: Ensuring Top-Tier Science from Moon to Stars\n\nToday, Ken Carpenter is a scientist for NASA\u2019s Hubble and Roman space\ntelescopes, but in 1967 he was just a teenager at his local library out to\nfact-check a \u201cStar Trek\u201d episode.
