Siberia will become one of the safest places on\nEarth\u2014which is yet another reason \u201cthe Anglo-Saxon elites\u201d want to capture the\nregion from Russia.\n\nSo says Nikolai Patrushev, the second-most powerful man in Moscow. Currently\nthe head of Russia\u2019s Security Council, Patrushev has been a colleague of\nVladimir Putin\u2019s since the two served in the Leningrad KGB in the 1970s and is\nnow the president\u2019s confidant and top adviser. A general of the army and a\nformer director of the FSB\u2014the successor agency to the Soviet KGB\u2014Patrushev is\nalso the de facto overlord of the country\u2019s other secret services. Among\nKremlin courtiers, he alone appears licensed to speak for Putin on strategic\nmatters, including nuclear weapons, the war in Ukraine, and Russia\u2019s view of\nthe U.S., Europe, and NATO.\n\nFollowing Putin\u2019s lead, many top Russian bureaucrats compete in conjuring up\nmonstrous conspiracy theories. Yet even in this cracked-up crowd, Patrushev\nstands out for the luridness and intensity of his anti-West\u2014and especially\nanti-U.S.\u2014animus. The hyperbole of his comments would make the Soviet\npropagandists of my youth blush: His prominence is a reminder that, if Putin\nwere to lose power tomorrow, his potential successors could be more warlike\nand expansionist, not less. Americans should worry about how much Patrushev\u2019s\noutlook reinforces his boss\u2019s\u2014and about how his delusional, more-belligerent-\nthan-Putin fulminations in long interviews with top-circulation Russian\nnewspapers become the party line, which deafening propaganda then inculcates\nin the mind of millions of Russians.\n\nIn Patrushev\u2019s telling, the West has been maligning and bullying Russia for\nhalf a millennium. As early as the 16th century, \u201cRussophobic\u201d Western\nhistorians besmirched Russia\u2019s first czar, Ivan IV\u2014a mass murderer and sadist\nbetter known as Ivan the Terrible. Patrushev insists that Ivan is merely a\nvictim of a concocted \u201cblack legend\u201d that \u201cportrayed him as a tyrant.\u201d\n\nTo the Security Council chief, the West\u2019s 20th-century siege of Russia had\nnothing to do with communism and the Cold War. In fact, the fall of the mighty\nSoviet Union made the country a softer target for the Western plotters, and\nthe United States strove to exploit the opportunity by forcing Russia to give\nup its \u201csovereignty, national consciousness, culture, and an independent\nforeign and domestic policy.\u201d The conspiracy\u2019s final objectives are Russia\u2019s\ndismemberment, the elimination of the Russian language, the country\u2019s removal\nfrom the geopolitical map, and its confinement to the borders of the Duchy of\nMuscovy, a small medieval realm.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n  * ### Why Don\u2019t More Men Take Their Wives\u2019 Last Names?\n\nCaroline Kitchener\n\n  * ### The Bleak Truth Behind My \u2018Inspiring\u2019 Path From Oakland to Yale\n\nAkintunde Ahmad\n\n  * ### Can a Dolphin Really Commit Rape?\n\nAdam Rutherford\n\nEliot A. Cohen: The shortest path to peace\n\nIn Patrushev\u2019s world, the U.S. invents new viruses in biological-weapons labs\nto annihilate the peoples of \u201cobjectionable states,\u201d and the COVID-19 virus\n\u201ccould have been created\u201d by the Pentagon with the assistance of several of\nthe largest transnational pharmaceutical firms and the \u201cClinton, Rockefeller,\nSoros, and Biden foundations.\u201d\n\nPatrushev\u2019s greatest current fixation is \u201call this story with Ukraine\u201d\u2014a\nconfrontation supposedly \u201cengineered in Washington.\u201d In 2014, by his account,\nthe U.S. plotted the Maidan Revolution in Kyiv\u2014a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d\u2014that pushed out\na pro-Moscow president and sought to fill Ukrainians with \u201cthe hatred of\neverything Russian.\u201d Today, Ukraine is no more than a testing ground for aging\nU.S. armaments as well as a place whose natural resources the West would\nprefer to exploit mercilessly\u2014and \u201cwithout the indigenous population.\u201d\nPreserving Ukraine as a sovereign state is not in America\u2019s plans, Patrushev\nclaims. Afraid of attacking Russia directly, \u201cNATO instructors herd Ukrainian\nboys to certain death\u201d in the trenches. Indeed, the West is essentially\nperpetrating an \u201cannihilation\u201d of the Ukrainians, whereas Russia\u2019s goal is to\n\u201cput an end to the West\u2019s bloody experiment to destroy the fraternal people of\nUkraine.\u201d\n\nThis is the picture of the world that Patrushev serves up to Putin. The\nadviser provides \u201ca framework\u201d for the Russian president\u2019s vision, the\nprominent Russian political sociologist Nikolai Petrov has argued.\n\nRepeated and internalized by its audience, propaganda captures and imprisons\nthe propagandist. Patrushev said last May that Western special services were\ntraining terrorists and saboteurs for \u201ccommitting crimes on the territory of\nour country.\u201d Russian civilians have suffered because of that view. Weeks\nbefore Islamic State terrorists attacked a music hall in a Moscow suburb late\nlast month, U.S. intelligence officials told the Russian government about a\nthreat to the venue. Putin dismissed the U.S.\u2019s warning as \u201cobvious blackmail\u201d\nand a \u201cplot to scare and destabilize our society.\u201d\n\nWhile furnishing his compatriots with elaborately paranoid interpretations of\nthe world, Patrushev vigorously participates in shaping it. More and more a\npolicy maker in his own right, he frequently stands in for Putin in essential\nnegotiations with top allies, reducing Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to\nceremonial duties and the signing of meaningless treaties. As the exiled\nRussian journalist Maxim Glikin has pointed out, Patrushev is where foreign\npolicy meets war. This nexus expands inexorably.\n\nAfter Russia\u2019s drubbing in Ukraine in the summer and fall of 2022, Patrushev\nflew to Tehran in November of that year to negotiate the sale of Iranian\ndrones. He has traveled to Latin America to meet with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\nof Venezuela and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. With Cuban President\nMiguel D\u00edaz-Canel, Patrushev discussed \u201cAmerica-orchestrated color\nrevolutions,\u201d the \u201cdestructive activities\u201d of nongovernment organizations, and\nthe dispatching of Cuban troops to Belarus \u201cfor training.\u201d\n\nPatrushev works the darker side of Putin\u2019s policies as well. He was likely\ninvolved in the 2006 poisoning in London of the FSB defector Alexander\nLitvinenko. The attempted killing in Salisbury, England, of the former double\nagent Sergei Skripal 12 years later would have required his sign-off.\nPatrushev is also plausibly suspected of firsthand involvement in last\nAugust\u2019s killing of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the rebellious commander of the Wagner\nmercenary group. The judicial murder of the prominent regime opponent Alexei\nNavalny, too, could not have happened without Patrushev\u2019s approval. Indeed, as\nthe Russian-opposition essayist Alexander Ryklin has pointed out, the only\nofficials who could have authorized the slow execution of Navalny were Putin\nand Patrushev.\n\nPerhaps most chilling, Patrushev has some sway over Russia\u2019s nuclear strategy.\nIn October 2009, he announced in an interview with the national newspaper\nIzvestia that Russian nuclear weapons were not just for use in a \u201clarge-scale\u201d\nwar. Contrary to the restriction spelled out in the 2000 version of Russian\nmilitary doctrine, Patrushev proposed that Russia\u2019s nukes could be deployed in\na conventional regional conflict or even a local one. He also thought that in\na \u201ccritical situation,\u201d a preventive strike against an aggressor \u201cmay not be\nexcluded.\u201d Four months later, Putin signed a revision of the doctrine. As\nPatrushev had suggested, a conflict would no longer have to be \u201clarge-scale\u201d\nfor Russia to reach for its atomic bombs and missiles. (Patrushev\u2019s agitation\nfor preventive nuclear attacks has yet to make the text of the doctrine, but\nPutin\u2019s blunt nuclear blackmail in the past two years suggests that Patrushev\nmay eventually get his wish.)\n\nIn its efforts to understand Russia\u2019s intentions, the United States has tried\nto get to know Patrushev better. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan\u2019s\nfirst call to Patrushev was on January 25, 2021, five days after Joe Biden\u2019s\ninauguration. Sullivan and Patrushev would go on to speak on the phone five\nmore times, in addition to meeting in Reykjavik in May of that year. After\ntheir conversation in November, according to The New York Times, Patrushev\nreported discussing ways of \u201cimproving the atmosphere of Russian-American\nrelations.\u201d A joint statement indicated that Sullivan and Patrushev had\ndiscussed \u201cincreasing trust between the two countries.\u201d\n\nAnna Nemtsova: Putin\u2019s \u2018rabble of thin-necked henchmen\u2019\n\nThirteen weeks later, Russia invaded Ukraine. One of no more than a handful of\nofficials who\u2019d known about Putin\u2019s plan\u2014and reportedly a driving force behind\nit\u2014Patrushev presumably enjoyed weaving a web of dezinformatsiya around his\nAmerican counterpart.\n\nThis would have been all the more gratifying because of the Kremlin\u2019s\nconviction that time was on Russia\u2019s side. In Patrushev\u2019s view, the West is\nslowly expiring. European civilization has no future, he has said. Its\npolitics are in the \u201cdeepest moral and intellectual decline\u201d; it is headed for\nthe \u201cdeepest economic and political crisis.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s downfall is also nigh, portended not only by ashes at Yellowstone\nbut by the nation\u2019s basic geography. The United States is but \u201ca patchwork\nquilt\u201d that could \u201ceasily come apart at the seams.\u201d Furthermore, Patrushev\ntold the main government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the American South\ncould be drifting toward Mexico, whose lands the U.S. grabbed in 1848: \u201cBeyond\ndoubt,\u201d America\u2019s \u201csouthern neighbors\u201d will reclaim the stolen lands, and a\npassive U.S. citizenry will do nothing to preserve the \u201cwholeness\u201d of the\ncountry.\n\nIn this and many other ways, Patrushev\u2019s worldview will seem utterly alien to\nmost Americans. But his enormous influence underscores that Putin is far from\nthe only force preventing Russian politics from reorienting toward a more\nliberal regime.\n\nThe pendulum of Russian history has generally oscillated between brutal,\nbellicose regimes and softer, less repressive autocracies that retreat from\nconfrontation with the West. But this pattern may not hold for the post-Putin\nfuture. After a quarter century under Putin, Russia\u2019s secret services, the\nfoundation of his regime, have degraded all other institutions and monopolized\npower. Patrushev, who turns 73 in July, is a year older than the president.\nYet should he survive Putin, Patrushev is certain to deploy his secret army to\nhelp guide the transition and may well have a shot at coming out on top. As he\nlikes to say, truth is on his side.\n\nLeon Aron is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
