While carbon dioxide is released naturally, sulphur hexafluoride\nis a man-made gas that traps heat very effectively.\n\nIn 2019 the UK became the first major economy to pass into law a commitment to\nnet zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp\n\nKeep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following\nSky News\n\nTap here\n\nRead more on Sky News: Scottish government ditches flagship climate change\ntarget 'Net zero isn't woke, it's a serious thing' An uncomfortable truth\nabout climate targets\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelp of artificial intelligence\n\nResearchers used computer simulations to accurately predict how molecules\nwould assemble themselves into the new material, which Dr Little said could be\nfurther enhanced in future through the use of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHe added that with the help of AI an \"unprecedented supply of new materials\"\nthat can assist in solving the most pressing challenges could be created,\nwithout the need for them to be made in a lab.\n\nSpreaker This content is provided by Spreaker, which may be using cookies and\nother technologies.
