The efficiency at that time was around 6%. A lot has happened\nsince then.\n\nApril 25, 2024 pv magazine\n\n  * Technology\n  * Technology and R&D\n  * United States\n\nSolar cells developed in 1976\n\nImage: John Marton, Wikimedia Commons\n\n#### Share\n\nFrom pv magazine Germany\n\nExactly 70 years ago today, scientists at Bell Labs in New Jersey presented\nthe first practical \u201csolar battery\u201d to the public. The New York Times reported\nat the time that \u201cthis invention could mark the beginning of a new era \u2013 the\nharnessing of the almost limitless solar energy for human civilization.\u201d\n\nHowever, it took several decades for this vision to become tangible. The\nglobal growth of PV has only really gained momentum in the last 10 years.\nWhile 1 GW of PV power was installed worldwide throughout 2004, by 2010 it was\nat 1 GW per month. Five years later, installation reached 1 GW per week and\nmost recently, around 1 GW per day, according to Carsten Pfeiffer, head of\nstrategy at Germany\u2019s Bundesverband Neue Energiewirtschaft association, in a\nrecent Twitter thread. \u201cWe will probably see an annual increase of 1 TW within\nthis decade,\u201d he stated.\n\nU.S. scientists Daryl Chapin, Gerald Pearson and Calvin Fuller initially only\nhad the task of developing a reliable energy source for remote telephone\nsystems where conventional batteries had been ineffective. Solar cells made\nfrom the semiconductor material selenium had already been developed, but their\nefficiency was too low for useful applications.\n\nSystematic, months-long development of a silicon solar cell produced the\nfunctioning prototype for the first usable solar module, which was presented\non April 25, 1954. The efficiency at the time was only 6%. This initially\nincreased slowly in the following decades. Only over the last two decades, due\nto the industrialization of PV production and accelerated technical progress,\nhas this increased to around 25%, which is close to the physical limit\nestablished for silicon solar cells.\n\nEven today, Bell Labs \u2013 which was then part of AT&T and now operates under\nNokia Bell Labs \u2013 calls \u201cthe solar cell\u201d one of its \u201cgreatest innovations.\u201d\nThe three scientists were posthumously honored for their invention in 2008 by\nbeing inducted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2004, the US Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory\n(NREL) published an article celebrating the cell\u2019s 50th birthday.\n\nAuthor: Thomas Seltmann\n\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.
