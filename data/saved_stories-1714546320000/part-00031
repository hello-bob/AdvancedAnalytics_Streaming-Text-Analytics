I\u2019m just a little intrigued here. In\nthe Gospel of John (the weird gospel) Jesus washes the feet of his disciples,\nincluding Judas. This has been mined to great effect, particularly by those\nwho suggest that in fact Judas was the greatest disciple because he was the\none who was willing to do what it took to provoke the sacrifice that completed\nthe second covenant. Anyway, I was playing with an AI image generator, trying\nto get an image of Jesus washing someone\u2019s feet. I had always thought that he\nhad washed the feet of lepers specifically or poor people generally, but I can\nonly find biblical evidence of him washing the disciples. In any event, the\npassage from John has long been seen as particularly evocative, and\ncorrespondingly has been a very common image in the history of Christian art,\nas a simple Google search will show:\n\nAnd yet I can\u2019t for the life of me get an AI to generate such an image. It\u2019s\nodd.\n\nHere\u2019s results (with various prompt tweaks) taken from Bing\u2019s image generator,\nwhich runs on Dall-E 3:\n\nHere\u2019s from Imagine.ART:\n\nStable Diffusion 2.1:\n\nHere\u2019s from Craiyon\u2019s generator:\n\nHere\u2019s from Dall-E mini, which runs on a more primitive version of Dall-E:\n\nI don\u2019t have Midjourney but I\u2019m sure some of you do, so feel free to try it\nout on there and report back with your findings.\n\nI tried dozens of variations on this request without success. I\u2019m sure enough\ntinkering would result in what I was asking for, but my results suggest that\nthere\u2019s clearly a... preference not to produce the image in question. An awful\nlot of the images I generated had the reversal problem you see repeatedly here\n- Jesus is getting his feet washed, not washing feet. It\u2019s true that Jesus\ngets his feet washed in the book of Luke, but the story where Jesus does the\nwashing is much more prominent both in Christian mythology and in art. And\nanyway, if these generators are as revolutionary as their marketing copy\nsuggests they shouldn\u2019t fall into subject-object issues like that. Other\nimages are kind of unclear on the whole feet thing in general. (The one where\nsomeone has Jesus\u2019s interchangeable feet laid out next to him is pretty fun.)\nI\u2019m particularly surprised because there\u2019s such a large historical artistic\ncorpus for this prompt, which would suggest plenty of training data, at least\nto a layman. So... what gives?\n\nIf I were to anthropomorphize, which I shouldn\u2019t, I might guess that they\u2019re\nthinking \u201cJesus is a leader, so he\u2019d be getting his feet washed by his\nfollowers, not the other way around.\u201d Alternatively, I allllllmost wonder if\nthis is a product of the kind of guardrails they\u2019ve had to put on these tools\nso that they\u2019re not offensive; maybe, somehow, their parameters suggest that\nit would be offensive to portray Jesus in a subservient position. Which is\nfunny because, you know, the whole thing about Jesus was his disinterest in\nworldly concerns about status.\n\nThen again, here\u2019s Google Gemini responding to the prompt \u201cGenerate an image\nof a triangle\u201d:\n\nOne for nine, and even the one hit has a lot of extra faff I didn\u2019t ask for.\nSo maybe I\u2019m just overthinking it and asking too much.\n\n### Subscribe to Freddie deBoer\n\nThousands of paid subscribers\n\ncool but rude\n\n103 Likes\n\n103\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why Doesn't AI Want to Show Me Jesus Washing the Feet of His Disciples?\n\nfreddiedeboer.substack.com\n\n57\n\nShare\n\n57 Comments\n\nEric4 hrs agoThe triangle in the bird picture is kind of cleverExpand full\ncommentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nTamAnalytic Converter4 hrs agoI was trying once for the life of me to get an\nimage of a guy staring off of the bow of a sinking ship on fire.
