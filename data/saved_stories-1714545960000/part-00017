Here\u2019s Why That Could Be An Engineering Challenge\n\n  * By Thomas Hundal\n  * April 30, 2024\n  * 1:59 pm\n  * 39 Comments\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNew regulations for automatic emergency braking have been bandied about for\nyears, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration finally made\nthem official this week. Come Sept. 1, 2029, almost all new cars sold in\nAmerica must have automatic emergency braking that can come to a complete stop\nand avoid a stopped vehicle ahead from 62 mph. It\u2019s an aggressive target, and\nwhile well-intentioned, it\u2019s a challenge that comes with a few strange\nexemptions and potential pitfalls.\n\nSee, these rules won\u2019t quite apply to all vehicles. Some vehicles will see\ndelayed introductions, some vehicles are exempt, and some vehicles will have\nvarying ways of disabling automatic emergency braking. First, low-volume\nmanufacturers get an extra year, until Sept. 1, 2030, to implement this new\ntech.\n\nDavid Goes To The XPEL Expo\n\nNext, these regulations don\u2019t apply to any vehicle with a gross vehicle weight\nrating of more than 10,000 pounds. GMC Hummer EVs, certain heavy-duty pickup\ntrucks, semi trucks, and basically anything with \u201cFinal Destination\u201d levels of\nmass is exempt from these regulations. Finally, there both will and won\u2019t be\nways to defeat these future automatic emergency braking systems. I\u2019ll let\nNHTSA explain.\n\n> NHTSA includes in this final rule an explicit prohibition against\n> manufacturers installing a control designed for the sole purpose of\n> deactivating the AEB system but allows for controls that have the ancillary\n> effect of deactivating the AEB system (such as deactivating AEB if the\n> driver has activated \u201ctow mode\u201d and the manufacturer has determined that AEB\n> cannot perform safely while towing).\n\nSo, if you\u2019re expecting a hard button to turn off automatic emergency braking,\ngood luck, but such a function may be bundled into track mode on performance\ncars, towing mode on trucks, certain off-road modes on SUVs, low-range 4X4, or\neven disabling stability control.\n\nAt speeds of up to 62 mph, these next-generation automatic emergency braking\nsystems must avoid a collision with a vehicle stopped on the roadway ahead.\nSounds great, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that braking distance is\nproportional to the square of the initial speed. Essentially, a car will need\nfour times the distance to stop from 60 mph than it would from 30 mph, and\ngiven what we\u2019ve seen from current automatic emergency braking systems, that\nwill certainly present a challenge.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRecently, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety revised its automatic\nemergency braking testing to include a motorcycle and a semi-trailer, and to\nup speeds from 18 and 25 mph to 31, 37, and 43 mph. Four of the ten compact\ncrossovers tested under the revised procedures scored the institute\u2019s lowest\nrating of \u201cPoor,\u201d and the Chevrolet Equinox provides a textbook example. As\nper an IIHS media release: \u201cWith the passenger car target, it slowed modestly\nin the 31 mph tests, and with the motorcycle target it barely reduced speed at\nall.\u201d\n\nNote that \u201cslowed modestly\u201d doesn\u2019t equal stopping. A number of systems on the\nmarket today fail testing at half the speed the new regulations, and these new\nregulations give automakers just over four years to get their systems up to\nspeed. Unsurprisingly, automakers are unsure whether this is possible, but\ncarmakers aren\u2019t the only ones.\n\nTake automotive supplier Bosch, which has an interest in supplying automakers\nwith better and more expensive sensor suites because that\u2019s how money is made.\nIn theory, this company should be all for stricter automatic emergency braking\nrequirements, but during comment period, the firm raised some concerns. As per\nNHTSA:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n> Bosch stated that its testing shows that when the speed reaches\n> approximately 75 km/h, there are reproducibility challenges with multi-\n> sensor fusion of the object in time to initiate AEB and avoid the\n> obstruction, and considerations should be made on how these requirements\n> align with current functional safety requirements.\n\nTranslation? Higher speeds affect the reliability of obstacle detection. Now,\nNHTSA has gone with a no-contact rule in testing under these new regulations,\nand the way to fudge for margin of error on that is to increase the envelope\nof what constitutes an automatic emergency braking event. However, phantom\nbraking can be just as dangerous as not coming to a stop due to creating a\nspeed delta, and NHTSA\u2019s upcoming tests false positive braking events aren\u2019t\nentirely confidence-inspiring.\n\nOne test involved driving between two parked cars, and that should be easy\nenough. Another involves driving over a steel trench plate, which is fairly\nstandard by now. Note the absence of glare testing for camera-based systems;\ntesting that incorporates lane shifting like in a construction zone; or\ntesting for excessive sensitivity while following a vehicle. Oh, and did I\nmention that NHTSA\u2019s phantom braking tests still allow some amount of braking\nof less than 0.25g higher peak deceleration than manual braking would entail?\nAgain, not ideal.\n\nLegislating stronger automatic emergency braking comes with great intentions,\nbut it\u2019s yet to be seen whether these beefed-up systems can function reliably\nand meet regulations. Given how long product stays on sale these days, 2029\nmay be less than one model cycle away for some vehicles, so automakers are\nlikely already trying to crack this challenge. Whatever happens, it\u2019s going to\nbe interesting.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n(Photo credits: Bosch, IIHS)\n\nSupport our mission of championing car culture by becoming an Official\nAutopian Member.\n\n  * #### Your Automatic Emergency Braking System Might Be Worse Than You Thought\n\n  * #### Here\u2019s Why Automatic High Beams Keep Getting Confused By Road Signs\n\n  * #### Ford Will Save $10 Million A Year Just By Ditching Its Slow Parallel Parking Assist System\n\n  * #### The Advanced Driving Assist System (ADAS) Pissing Contest In China Is Huge And Complicated So Here Is Your Comprehensive Guide And Ranking\n\nGot a hot tip?

Bad enough cars dinging and ringing\nabout everything. Between car features and your phone its no wonder everyone\nis losing their minds. Constantly distracted from everything but the task at\nhand. Sorry for the rant, but its just getting insufferable.\n\n2\n\nAutomotiveflux\n\n1 hour ago\n\nSafety features are great and I\u2019m glad that manufactures are required to have\nevery car be up to a certain standard but I wonder with things like this where\nthe line of diminishing returns starts. Automatic breaking is expensive to\ndevelop and will likely raise the price of the bottom end of the car spectrum\nyet again. So the question is, does the benefit outweigh the expense?\n\n1\n\n86-GL\n\n16 minutes ago\n\nReply to Automotiveflux\n\nIdk, these features in their current form are already available standard on\nsome very entry level vehicles, so I\u2019d say that bridge has has already been\ncrossed.\n\n0\n\nDanny Zabolotny\n\n1 hour ago\n\nGreat, more safety measures to reward people for not paying attention. I\nanticipate this will cause more accidents than it prevents, because it\u2019s not\nlike every single car will be brand new with this feature, so you\u2019ll have\nnewer cars suddenly slamming their brakes in front of older cars.\n\nI know a person that uses their automatic braking system as an everyday\nfeature rather than as a last resort... they\u2019re a menace to society in their\nlarge SUV.\n\n0\n\nSpikersaurusrex\n\n1 hour ago\n\nReply to Danny Zabolotny\n\nI\u2019d venture to say they\u2019d be a menace in a Miata, if that\u2019s how they drive.\n\n0\n\nTyler Durden\n\n1 hour ago\n\nThis is one more reason why new cars are too expensive.\n\n2\n\nMr Sarcastic\n\n1 hour ago\n\nI remember decades ago people were picked for important government positions\nbased on their knowledge and experience.

Not saying they weren\u2019t toadies but at least they had industry\nknowledge.\n\n0\n\nSpikersaurusrex\n\n2 hours ago\n\nWell, I can only hope that the technology is better in 2029 than it was in\n2019, but I\u2019m not optimistic. My 2019 Mercedes doesn\u2019t have automatic braking,\nbut it does beep at me incessantly when I\u2019m going around a tight turn with a\nwall on the outside. Sometimes even a dark shadow is enough to set it off.\nWith AEB, it would be slamming on the brakes, probably causing accidents.\n\n2\n\nJambles Hamblepants\n\n1 hour ago\n\nReply to Spikersaurusrex\n\nMine (2023 integra 6mt) engaged in a similar situation getting on the ferry\nlast weekend. Sharpish left turn up a very steep incline with a wall just to\nthe side. Woke me right up. Curiously I was able to drive right through it,\nthankfully not getting stopped on the ramp with the car behind me against my\nbumper. I guess it was only locking up the rear brakes.\n\n0\n\nMan With A Reliable Jeep\n\n2 hours ago\n\nJust throw us in personal transportation pods already.

Any safety\nincrease will also likely be offset by malfunctioning systems and people\npaying less attention than they do now.\n\n0\n\nScottingham\n\n2 hours ago\n\nReply to Spikersaurusrex\n\nYou\u2019re probably right. Maybe when most cars are level 4+ autonomous I can get\nback on the roads. Until then, I guess it\u2019s sleeper e bikes and dreams of\nrokons for me.\n\n0\n\nMr Sarcastic\n\n1 hour ago\n\nReply to Spikersaurusrex\n\nGood point on most roads people follow close enough to create warnings. Will\nthese vehicles be able to differentiate between close moving vehicles and\nstopped vehicles?\n\n0\n\nSam Hoffman\n\n2 hours ago\n\nIs this yet another nail in the coffin of the manual transmission?\n\n0\n\nWidgetsltd\n\n2 hours ago\n\nReply to Sam Hoffman\n\nPossibly. It\u2019s notable that the 2024 Subaru WRX and BRZ with manual\ntransmission are equipped with the Eyesight safety system for the 2024 model\nyear. Previously, Eyesight was not available on manual transmission equipped\nvehicles.\n\n0\n\nSam Hoffman\n\n1 hour ago\n\nReply to Widgetsltd\n\nDo those have automatic braking? It seems to me that the car would either have\nto have a clutch override or just kill the engine, both of which could be\nproblematic.\n\n0\n\nJambles Hamblepants\n\n1 hour ago\n\nReply to Sam Hoffman\n\nMy integra 6mt has it, so no. It engages too easily. See my comment above\nthough. I was able to ignore it when it incorrectly engaged last weekend.\n\n0\n\nJTilla\n\n33 minutes ago\n\nReply to Jambles Hamblepants\n\nCan you turn it off?\n\n0\n\nMr Sarcastic\n\n1 hour ago\n\nReply to Sam Hoffman\n\nNope just keep the old stuff running, they are more fun and use the 20 year\nold rule to import them.\n\n1\n\nTheCrank\n\n2 hours ago\n\nSpring and summer of 2029 should be good for new car sales.\n\n1\n\nRidesBicyclesButLovesCars\n\n2 hours ago\n\nI wish we could post memes.\n\nInsert Oprah handing out \u201cPhantom Braking for All!\u201d gif.\n\n0\n\nV10omous\n\n2 hours ago\n\nThis strikes me as well-intentioned but not ideal.\n\nHow will it handle dirty or icy sensors? Or for that matter an icy road?\nSlamming on the brakes at full power could be the opposite of what\u2019s needed\nthere.\n\n1\n\n86-GL\n\n2 hours ago\n\nReply to V10omous\n\nI would guess much the same as vehicles currently do. If there is dirt or snow\non any of the sensors on our 2021 F150, it gives you a warning that the\nfeature is inactive, which you must hit \u2018OK\u2019 on the steering wheel to accept.\nSeems reasonable.\n\nGiven that this will functionally still be an advanced ADAS feature- with the\ndriver assumed to be in legal control of the vehicle- I would imagine there\nwill be some regulatory tolerance for the system not functioning in adverse\nconditions. Especially if they\u2019re already willing to make allowances for\ntowing, driving modes, etc.\n\nProvided these systems are engineered to be reasonable in their functionality\nand not cause new safety issues, this is one situation where I am okay with\nnot letting perfect be the enemy of good, unlike true autonomy. Even if this\nimproved AEB is only 50% effective in the real world, it could still save a\nlot of collisions.\n\n1\n\nV10omous\n\n2 hours ago\n\nReply to 86-GL\n\nThe situation I\u2019m concerned with is a false positive (an unnecessary braking\nevent) and any circumstance that could allow that to happen.\n\nI\u2019m not usually a Luddite, in fact I usually enjoy laughing at the most\nextreme examples of that tendency in this comment section. I\u2019m a bit more\nconcerned at the ability of the car to take control *in spite* of driver\naction here. Even self-driving has to be actively turned on.\n\n1\n\n86-GL\n\n1 hour ago\n\nReply to V10omous\n\nI agree, I would hope the systems are tuned on the conservative side to\neliminate false positives.\n\nI think the systems will have to be lenient- I\u2019m no lawyer, but AEB failing to\nstop a collision that *would have happened anyways* due to justifiable\ncircumstances seems more legally defensible than over zealous AEB causing an\nunnecessary collision.\n\n1\n\nMr Sarcastic\n\n1 hour ago\n\nReply to V10omous\n\nOr a bug right before it slams into a sensor. \u201c40 car pile upon the Tri Boro\nBridge tonite due to a dragonfly being mistaken for a UPS truck\u201d alas Doug\ncan\u2019t get home to Carrie tonite.\n\n0\n\nIRegertNothing, Esq.\n\n2 hours ago\n\nMandatory for everything except giant fucking SUVs and pickups.
