It\u2019s why OKRs work, and why being\ndata-driven is no longer optional for everyone in business.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing\u2014\n\nWhat about what you don\u2019t measure? More specifically, what about what you\ncan\u2019t measure?\n\nThese days we like to pretend we can measure anything with surveys, but Peter\nDrucker\u2019s quote still rings true: \u201cWhat\u2019s measured improves.\u201d\n\nIf you are measuring survey responses, you can improve survey responses.\nThere\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019re actually improving, say, customer satisfaction, no\nmatter how many times you declare that this survey response represents\ncustomer satisfaction.\n\nBut things get even more complicated from here: what if we think beyond\ncustomer satisfaction and think about human misery? How do we know our\nproducts are not creating that? or other bad things like loneliness,\ndisconnection, or grief?\n\nThink about the cup holder: a mainstay in American cars, one I always took for\ngranted.\n\nOnce I moved to Europe, I went on a trip in a borrowed car, and, as is typical\nin Europe, the car did not have cupholders. I was in the passenger seat, and\nbecause of the absence of this feature, I was essentially the driver\u2019s\ncupholder. Research and surveys, and even common sense could tell you this was\ninconvenient. It would be even more inconvenient if the driver didn\u2019t have a\npassenger next to them. But I realized something strange while holding my\nhusbands water, coffee, or whatever else\u2014 I realized that I liked being of\nservice to the driver. Because he would have to ask me to grab it, it made us\ntalk more during the drive. I couldn\u2019t help but think that the cupholder\nfeature impacts us in complex ways, and in ways I didn\u2019t particularly like. It\ncan isolate us from our fellow carmates. The absence of the cupholder makes\nthe front-seat passenger more of a crewmember rather than a passenger. A\nhelper. The cupholder would eliminate this warm social act of service.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, I guess this feels insignificant, but I don\u2019t\nthink it is. As things become more and more convenient, we become more and\nmore independent. Nobody is tracking how this is happening, and nobody really\ncares.\n\nThe product is meant to make things convenient. It\u2019s tested for convenience.\nThe metrics say it\u2019s 90% more convenient.\n\nWe can\u2019t expect product designers or businesses to track every impact of their\nproducts. But anyone who is putting something out there, I think, should think\nabout it.\n\nThe effects of products scale, especially products we use daily or weekly. We\ndeal with these unintended consequences regularly, and they begin to impact\nour lives, often negatively. No matter how mild these externalities, they are\nreal, compounding, and changing life as we know it.\n\nAnother story: My ceramics professor spotted me putting a misshaped cup on the\nrack to be fired. He asked me if I really wanted that fired, if it was good in\nmy eyes. I said no, but I \u201cmight as well.\u201d He took it off, handed it to me and\ninstructed me to start over. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, \u201cSomeone in 2,000 years\nmight discover this and judge our entire civilization on it. You have a\nresponsibility to make things good.\u201d\n\n\u2013 November 25, 2023February 24, 2024\n\n### Leave a Comment Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
