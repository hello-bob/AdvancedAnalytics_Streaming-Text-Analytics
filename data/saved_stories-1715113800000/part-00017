Gone is stuff like encouraged password sharing and risk-\ntaking programming. In its place is endless price hikes, weird efforts to\nnickel-and-dime users, lower-quality programming, annoying new consumer\nrestrictions, and layoffs.\n\nOne of the favorite tweaks of sectors that have run out of ideas is\nconsolidation and megamergers. Such deals almost always result in layoffs,\nlower-quality product, large debt loads, price hikes, and consumer\ndissatisfaction. But such deals also goose stock price, generate big tax\nbreaks, and let fail-upward brunchlord executives put \u201csavvy big boy\ndealmaker\u201d on their resumes, so they continue apace.\n\nAs predicted, with the streaming sector all out of fresh ideas and Wall Street\ndemanding impossible quarterly revenue growth at any cost, it\u2019s time for a\nbunch of pointless consolidation. The first wave was the disastrous AT&T\u2014>Time\nWarner Cable\u2014>Discovery megadeals, which resulted in wave upon wave of chaos,\nlayoffs, price hikes, and pissed off creators.\n\nNow Paramount (CBS) is looking to follow suit. First the company discussed\npotentially merging with Time Warner Discovery, but once that idea was laughed\nout of the room they moved on to a potential deal with Skydance Media. But\nthat deal also appears to have fallen apart, with a $26 billion acquisition by\nSony looking like the most likely outcome.\n\nAs the New York Times notes, there\u2019s some dwindling concerns about a Japanese\ncompany owning an American broadcaster (CBS), given that what\u2019s left of our\nmedia consolidation regulations still restricts foreign ownership of a major\nbroadcaster (for now!). So it\u2019s probably going to be a joint-purchase between\nSony and U.S.-based Apollo Global Management:\n\n> \u201cAny deal between the Sony group and Paramount faces hurdles. Government\n> regulations restrict foreign ownership of broadcast networks and could\n> prevent Sony\u2019s parent company, based in Japan, from owning CBS outright. The\n> bidding group would probably push for Apollo, which is based in the United\n> States, to hold the rights to the CBS broadcast license, according to two\n> people familiar with their strategy.\n\nAt the heart of this dysfunction sits Wall Street\u2019s need for improved\nquarterly growth at any cost. It\u2019s not just good enough to provide a\nprofitable, high quality product, people like. The need for impossible,\nunlimited quarterly growth inevitably results in a sort of corporate\ncannibalism, most recently popularized by Cory Doctorow\u2019s term\nenshittification.\n\nWhat interests me as a media and consolidation critic is that absolutely none\nof the press coverage (Deadline, Axios, Variety, The New York Times) can\nmuster so much as a single mention of the long, long history of harmful media\nconsolidation, or how such deals almost always result in rampant layoffs,\nlower quality product, price hikes, endless distraction, cancelled programs,\nand tons of debt.\n\nEven with the downright comical Time Warner Discovery megadeal right there in\nthe rear view mirror (which, if we\u2019re being honest, extends back to the\npointless and somehow even more disastrous AOL Time Warner merger), these\noutlets just genuinely don\u2019t think any of that history is useful reader\ncontext. The harm of mindless consolidation is just completely memory holed in\nthe industry\u2019s coverage of itself.\n\nThat said, I imagine Sony would be a better caretaker of the CBS family of\nbrands than many suitors, given that (unlike, say, AT&T), they\u2019re at least\nfamiliar with running a media company. But it\u2019s still painfully obvious that\nthis sort of consolidation never really benefits employees, consumers, or the\noverall health and quality of the company and brands. It\u2019s just a game of\npointless brunchlord patty cake.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t expect a consolidated media sector to linger too long on the\nharmful history of \u201cgrowth for growth\u2019s sake\u201d consolidation when covering\nitself, but an occasional, fleeting nod at history and factual reality might\nbe nice.\n\nFiled Under: competition, consolidation, layoffs, media, megadeals, mergers,\nstreamingg Companies: cbs, paramount, sony\n\n6 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Three Cities Sue Axon; Claim It Has A Monopoly On Body Cams, Electronic Weapons\n  * Was There A Trojan Horse Hidden In Section 230 All Along That Could Enable Adversarial Interoperability?\n  * Discovery CEO Zaslav Gets A Big Fat Raise Despite Being Terrible At His Job\n  * Net Neutrality Is Back!

I bet if they charged US$10 a\nmonth for commercial free and offered a free version that had 1 minute of\ncommercials at the start of each show/movie, they would get a lot of\nsubscribers.\n\nI know that\u2019s hardly original but it\u2019s just crazy enough that it might work.\nAnd if it doesn\u2019t they could license their content to some other streaming\nservice and just rake in free cash from their library of old shows and movies.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nStrawb (profile) says:\n\nMay 7, 2024 at 6:13 am\n\n# Re:\n\nGet out of here with your reasonable and potentially popular ideas!
