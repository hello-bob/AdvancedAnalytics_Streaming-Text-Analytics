Paul Gertler,\nSebastian Galiani and Mauricio Romero surveyed economics journals to find out\nhow to fix it.\n\nBy\n\n  * Paul Gertler^0,\n  * Sebastian Galiani^1 &\n  * Mauricio Romero^2\n\n  1.

That is not necessarily\nbecause funding is unavailable \u2014 it is because the current system makes\noriginal authors and replicators antagonists. Focusing on the fields of\neconomics, political science, sociology and psychology, in which ready access\nto raw data and software code are crucial to replication efforts, we survey\ndeficiencies in the current system.\n\n## Access options\n\nAccess through your institution\n\nChange institution\n\nBuy or subscribe\n\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n24,99 \u20ac / 30 days\n\ncancel any time\n\nLearn more\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\nReceive 51 print issues and online access\n\n199,00 \u20ac per year\n\nonly 3,90 \u20ac per issue\n\nLearn more\n\nRent or buy this article\n\nPrices vary by article type\n\nfrom$1.95\n\nto$39.95\n\nLearn more\n\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n\nNature 554, 417-419 (2018)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-02108-9\n\nThis work was funded by the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social\nSciences and by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.\n\n### Updates & Corrections\n\n  * Correction 22 March 2018: An earlier version of this Comment stated that only authors of non-replicated articles from the 3ie project described antagonism.
