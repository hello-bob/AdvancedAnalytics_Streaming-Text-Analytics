AMD's MI200 series AI accelerators utilize TSMC's\n5 and 6nm processes. AMD uses both System-on-Integrated-Chips (SoIC) advanced\npackaging to integrate CPU and GPU dies as well as CoWoS for high bandwidth\nmemory (HBM) products.\n\nTSMC is expected to produce CoWoS at a monthly rate of between 45,000 to\n50,000 units by the end of the year, and SoIC between 5,000 and 6,000 a month\nin the same time frame. TSMC's SoIC is predicted to hit 10,000 a month by the\nend of 2025.\n\nThe Register asked TSMC to confirm the report and will update if a substantial\nreply materializes.\n\nOn last month's earnings call, neither AMD or Nvidia were mentioned by name.\nDan Nystedt, an analyst who focuses on semiconductor companies, has estimated\nthat Nvidia accounted for 11 percent of TSMC's revenue in 2023, and Apple, its\nbiggest customer, 25 percent. Nysted claimed that \"TSMC's top 10 customers\naccounted for 91 percent of net revenue\" in 2023, up from 82 percent in 2022.\"\nHe added that AMD was also in the top 10.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan asked the company last month: \"I know ...\nyour CoWoS capacity has been very tight, very strategic. But I'm wondering how\nyou're going to judge the demand and allocate the capacity to all the\ndifferent type of AI semi customers. Because we're hearing your major customer\nis demanding 2x capacity next year. \"I'm wondering how you're going to\nallocate, so I mean, will you still reserve a certain percentage for some\nsmaller or strategic customers no matter if it's ASIC or smaller GPU vendors?\nSo what is the kind of benchmark you're going to allocate those capacity to\ncustomers?\"\n\nJeff Su, TSMC director of Investor Relations responded in the call: \"So\nCharlie... notes that the CoWoS capacity, the demand is very strong today and\nalso into 2025. So the capacity is very tight. So his question is, how does\nTSMC decide on how to allocate the capacity to customers, where we have large\ncustomers, but will we reserve capacity to support smaller customers as well?\n\n\"Let me say it again, the demand is very, very strong, and we have done our\nbest where we put all the effort to increase the capacity. It's probably more\nthan double this year as compared with last year. However, it's still not\nenough to meet the customers' demand, and we leverage our OSAT partners to\ncomplement... TSMC's capacity to fulfill our customers' need.\"\n\n  * Dell shaves months off lead times for GPU-powered AI servers\n  * TSMC sees semiconductor bounce as Q1 revenues rise 16.5%\n  * TSMC says first 1.6nm chips coming in 2026\n  * SK hynix's high bandwidth memory buffet fully booked till 2025\n\nThe chip giant suffered damage to its CoWoS plant when an earthquake hit last\nmonth. The company said that its chip supply was not dented from the event,\nalthough its capex may be.\n\nAnalyst TrendForce said on Tuesday that after the earthquake, the memory\nindustry as a whole experienced increased prices in both DRAM, including HBM,\nand NAND flash that were \"larger than initially expected.\" It forecast a Q2\nincrease in contract price for DRAM flash of 13-18 percent and 15-20 percent\nfor NAND flash.\n\nFurthermore, TrendForce reported that \"manufacturers are wary of potential\ncrowding out effects on HBM capacity.\"\n\nThe market research firm also predicted on Monday that HBM demand will grow\n200 percent this year, and double again in 2025. Prices are projected to rise\nas well, between five and ten percent, in 2025.\n\nSouth Korean memory maker SK hynix boasts a HBM market share of 90 percent or\nmore. Earlier this month, TSMC and SK hynix partnered to collaborate on HBM4\ndevelopment and next-generation packaging technology. HBM4 is slated to be\nmass produced from 2026. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * DRAM\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Taiwan\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * DRAM\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Taiwan\n  * TSMC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Kioxia\n  * NVMe\n  * SSD\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Semiconductor\n  * Storage\n\n#### More about\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n#### More about\n\n  * DRAM\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Taiwan\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * DRAM\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Taiwan\n  * TSMC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Kioxia\n  * NVMe\n  * SSD\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Semiconductor\n  * Storage\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### SK hynix breaks Q1 revenue records on back of AI boom\n\nMemory biz ditches NAND production plans to make more crucial HBM tech\n\nStorage12 days |\n\n#### SK hynix's high bandwidth memory buffet fully booked till 2025\n\nMicron also riding the AI wave with 128 GB DDR5 RDIMMs\n\nStorage5 days | 1\n\n#### TSMC says first 1.6nm chips coming in 2026\n\nWatch out Intel ...
