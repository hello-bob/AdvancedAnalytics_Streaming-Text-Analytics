I\nreally should have done this years ago when that XKCD was first published.The\nfollowing code compiles in gcc and runs in the way that anyone who wants to\nwrite such code would want it to run. The hover text in the XKCD comic is\ncorrect. You could have a style guide for such programming, store error\nmessages in the doctor and nurse emoji for example.\n\n    \n    \n    #include <stdio.h> int main() { int = 1, = 2; printf(\"=%d, =%d\\n\", , ); return 0; }\n\nTo get this to display correctly in Debian you need to install the fonts-noto-\ncolor-emoji package (used by the KDE emoji picker that runs when you press\nWindows-. among other things) and restart programs that use emoji. The Konsole\nterminal emulator will probably need it\u2019s profile settings changed to work\nwith this if you ran Konsole before installing fonts-noto-color-emoji. The\nKitty terminal emulator works if you restart it after installing fonts-noto-\ncolor-emoji.This web page gives a list of HTML codes for emoji [2]. If I start\nwriting real code with emoji variable names then I\u2019ll have to update my source\nto HTML conversion script (which handles <>\" and repeated spaces) to convert\nemoji.I spent a couple of hours on this and I think it\u2019s worth it. I have\nfiled several Debian bug reports about improvements needed to issues related\nto emoji.\n\n  * [1] https://xkcd.com/1513/\n  * [2] https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_emojis.asp\n\nRelated posts:\n\n  1.

(That is a compliment in case it wasn\u2019t clear.)\n  * Gunnar WolfApril 25, 2024 at 02:47I suggest you pair this post with a terminal such as Kitty. Being Kitty scriptable, it is loaded with several \u201ckittens\u201d; I have a keybinding with Ctrl-Alt-U to trigger the \u201cunicode-input\u201d kitten, where you can easily search the Unicode character space by hex code or description, or choose from either your recorded favorite characters or the preset emoticons.My Unicode usage has spiked since I switched to Kitty ?\n\n### Leave a Reply\n\n|\n\n### Archives\n\n### Email and RSS\n\nRSS Feed of Articles RSS Feed of Comments Subscribe to etbe by Email\n\n", "frontpage": false}
