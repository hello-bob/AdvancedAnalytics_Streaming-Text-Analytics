As analyzed by American experts, the video, released by a Twitter\naccount known as OSINTtechnical, distinctly displays this modern integration.\n\nVideo screenshot\n\n  * 7 NATO aircraft were scanning Crimea for Russian air-defense sites\n  * Will UK Typhoons deployed in Poland provide scanning for AFU\n  * China\u2019s spy satellite snoops US Navy\u2019s Norfolk naval station\n\nSince the war began in February 2022, a myriad of Soviet-origin Ukrainian\nfighter jets have been upgraded with various Western systems, including\nmissiles. The exact process of how the tablet integrates with the missile\nlaunch system, however, remains a mystery, according to US analysts who\nscrutinized the somewhat obscure video footage.\n\nDr. William LaPlante, the US Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and\nSustainment, provided some perspective. In an April 24th interaction with\nreporters, he affirmed that numerous Western weapons had been successfully\nmodified for use on Ukrainian aircraft. \u201cWorking together with the Ukrainians,\nwe\u2019ve managed to outfit their planes with a range of Western weapons,\nessentially operated via an iPad in the cockpit. What\u2019s most impressive is the\nrapid adaptability, with the newly equipped planes being flown into conflict\njust a week after receiving the updated systems,\u201d he disclosed.\n\n> Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 Flanker Wild Weasel operations, seen here\n> conducting multiple low level standoff strikes against Russian radars with\n> US-supplied AGM-88 HARMs. pic.twitter.com/7CosjXFNkO\n>\n> \u2014 OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) April 21, 2024\n\nFrom the snapshot captured in the released video, we can only glean a modest\nportion of the entire story. It seems to depict an iPad or a similar device,\nthe screen of which exhibits an extensive geographic area\u2014the intended flight\npath of the missile to a target several kilometers distant. The device screen\nalso presents a cascade of puzzling data arranged in a table at its top, along\nwith more complex information along its left and bottom edges.\n\nLike a moth drawn to a flame, a recent video piqued our interest. It urged us\nto reevaluate the long-abandoned notion of \u201cthat\u2019s simply not possible\u201d. As we\ndelved deeper and consulted an expert well-versed in military C4ISR systems,\nthe seemingly improbable idea of utilizing an iPad or a similar device as a\nremote controller for a missile from a fighter jet began to take the shape of\nplausibility. The cornerstone of this audacious concept is the development of\na bespoke app or software equipped to exchange commands with the missile\u2019s\nonboard systems. Such software must be sophisticated enough to dispatch\ndirectives to the missile, retrieve feedback, and present this information in\nan easily comprehensible manner on the device screen.\n\nThe transmission of information between the iPad and the missile would\npresumably be initiated via a secure wireless connection, possibly a shielded\nWi-Fi or Bluetooth link. Through this connection, the device could issue\ncommands to be processed by the missile\u2019s onboard computer systems. These\ncommands could range from initiating a launch to adjusting trajectory, and\neven triggering detonation.\n\nPhoto credit: Yandex\n\nImagine the possibility of an iPad relaying real-time data from a missile\u2019s\nonboard sensors during flight. This could include crucial details such as the\nmissile\u2019s speed, altitude, and positioning, among other pertinent data. Such\ninformation could be instantaneously displayed to the user, enabling them to\nclosely track the missile\u2019s trajectory and implement any necessary adjustments\non the go.\n\nDespite these exciting prospects, several challenges suggest that the answers\nmay not be as straightforward. Incorporating consumer electronics within\nmilitary frameworks brings its own set of challenges, with security being a\nparamount concern. Any system that can remotely control a missile must have\nsuperior security measures in place, to prevent chances of unauthorized access\nor disruption.\n\nFurthermore, the harsh physical conditions under which the fighter jet\noperates greatly differ from the usual environments for which consumer\nelectronics like tablets are designed. The device should be robust enough to\nendure high G-forces, fluctuating temperature changes, and potentially survive\nin the face of gunfire. This necessitates a major overhaul of the tablet\u2019s\ndesign or the creation of a specialized instrument.\n\nPhoto credit: Wikipedia\n\nUndeniably, there\u2019s a possibility that the tablet may serve as the plane\u2019s\nnavigational system in this context. This carries significant importance,\nconsidering that Ukrainian Su-27 Flankers, for instance, have not seen an\nupgrade with original manufacturer components and systems in over ten years.\n\nThough notably advanced in the 1980s, today\u2019s standards render the Su-27\u2019s\nnavigation system somewhat obsolete. This system relies on terrestrial\nnavigation aids, augmented by onboard inertial navigation mechanisms. Despite\ntheir reliability, these systems don\u2019t offer the accuracy or real-time updates\ncharacteristic of modern, GPS-based systems.\n\nIn contrast, the iPad utilizes a combination of GPS, GLONASS [the Russian GPS\ncounterpart], Galileo [the EU\u2019s global navigation satellite system], and\nBeiDou [China\u2019s satellite navigation system] to determine positioning. This\nmultifaceted approach enhances accuracy, providing a redundancy feature.\nFurthermore, the iPad receives real-time satellite data updates regarding\nweather conditions, terrain, and other navigational factors.\n\nVideo screenshot\n\nContinually updated with the latest in software advancements and satellite\ndata, the iPad navigation system ensures the most accurate, up-to-the-minute\ninformation is always on hand. In stark contrast, updates to the Su-27\u2019s\nnavigation system require physical alterations to the aircraft, a process that\nis both cost-intensive and time-consuming.\n\nExpanding on the video clip in question, we are led to ask: is the iPad\ndirectly controlling the AGM-88 HARM missile, or does it simply serve as an\nauxiliary tool for the pilot? The notion that the HARM missile is controlled\nby an iPad might seem a bit of a stretch, considering it is primarily\nregulated by the fighter jet\u2019s built-in computer system. However, devices like\nan iPad can play a significant role in mission planning and control\nprocedures. Military personnel could use a tablet to operate mission planning\nsoftware, input objective coordinates, and transfer this information to the\nmissile\u2019s integrated computer ahead of launch.\n\nIn addition, the iPad can function as a receiver and display live data from\nthe missile\u2019s onboard sensors. This enables mission controllers to monitor the\nmissile\u2019s status and refine the mission plan as necessary in real-time. Yet,\nthis doesn\u2019t imply that the missile itself is directly under the control of an\niPad.\n\n***\n\nFollow us everywhere and at any time.
