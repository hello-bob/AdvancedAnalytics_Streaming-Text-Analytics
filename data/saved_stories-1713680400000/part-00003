After a solid start to the year when mortgage rates pulled back from\n23-year highs, existing home sales fell 4.3% in March. A reversal in borrowing\ncosts has kept affordability in the tank at the same time that other housing-\nrelated costs\u2014insurance, taxes, maintenance\u2014are soaring. Sales remain below\nyear-ago levels and about 20% below long-run norms; this after 2023 marked an\neven worse year than the Great Recession.  \n---  \n  \nSoft demand is taking the steam out of rising prices, which are still up\nnearly 5% in the past year due to a low supply of listings. While 30-year\nmortgage rates above 7% are curbing demand, it\u2019s the sub-3% and 4% rates of\ntwo years ago that are choking supply by keeping owners locked into current\nloans and homes. Sellers might also be waiting for new rules on realtor fees\nto take effect in July which promise to reduce commissions, while buyers might\nbe waiting to see if prices slip in response.Weak demand isn\u2019t lost on home\nbuilders. They started almost 15% fewer units in March than in February,\nholding below year-ago levels. Despite faster population growth, starts have\nfallen more than 20% since the Fed started tightening. And sagging building\npermits aren\u2019t pointing to a snappy comeback. In fact, the NAHB housing market\nindex is barely above breakeven levels in April.Also dissuading buyers is a\nsoft rental market. An earlier surge in apartment construction has lifted\napartment vacancy rates to 6.7% in March from under 4% in 2021. Though not\nhigh historically, vacancy rates are now modestly above pre-pandemic levels.\nAs a result, rent growth has moderated from earlier dizzying heights. After\nsoaring almost 16% y/y in early 2022, Zillow\u2019s Observed Rent Index cooled to a\n3.6% pace in March. According to Apartment List, the median rent paid for new\napartment leases has fallen modestly in the past year. Softer rents will help\non the inflation front, while also weighing on sales. It's cheaper to rent\nthan own a home. CBRE estimates that average new mortgage payments are 38%\nabove average apartment rents as of late 2023. The wide affordability gap\nfavouring renters didn\u2019t exist before prices went berserk in the pandemic.A\nstruggling housing market suggests restrictive monetary policy is working to\ncool demand\u2014at least for the 4% of GDP tied to residential construction. But\nunless the remaining 96% of the economy loses resiliency, as we suspect it\nwill, policy rates could stay high for longer, hurting those trying to get a\nleg up on the housing ladder.  \n---  \n  \nYou might also be interested in\n\n# General Disclosures\n\nBMO Capital Markets is a trade name used by BMO Financial Group for the\nwholesale banking businesses of Bank of Montreal, BMO Bank N.A.
