When asking Siri \"what time is\nit?\" Siri is unable to answer and directs users to the iPhone.\n\n\"I found some web results, I can show them if you ask again from your iPhone,\"\nis Siri's full response to the time question. If you ask what time it is in a\nspecific location, Siri is able to respond, and Siri on iPhone, iPad, and Mac\nprovides the time as usual when asked.\n\nThis is a bug that Apple will be able to fix server side, so it will likely be\naddressed quickly. In the meantime, to get the time from Siri on the HomePod\nwithout having to swap to an iPhone, include your location.\n\nSiri has long been ridiculed for failing to understand requests and not\nproviding the expected information, and small bugs like this are a bit\nembarrassing as Apple prepares for a major AI update.\n\nFor the last several months, Siri has also been struggling with HomeKit\ncommands, and there have been many complaints from smart home users. Asking\nSiri to \"turn off the lights in the living room,\" for example, often results\nin the lights being turned on or turned off in another room entirely.\nHopefully some of these issues will be solved with a Siri overhaul in iOS 18\nand its sister updates.\n\nUpdate: Apple seems to have fixed the issue somewhat. Asking \"what time is\nit?\" provides the time, but Siri is still not able to give the time if you ask\n\"what's the time?\" or \"can you tell me the time?\"\n\n(Thanks, Ben!)\n\nRelated Roundups: HomePod, HomePod mini\n\nTag: Siri Guide\n\nBuyer's Guide: HomePod (Buy Now), HomePod Mini (Neutral)\n\nRelated Forum: HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology\n\n[ 186 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nPlerf\n\n18 hours ago at 09:29 am\n\nIt\u2019s astonishing how incapable Siri still is.\n\nScore: 41 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nsw1tcher\n\n18 hours ago at 09:29 am\n\niPhone alarm doesn't work ('https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/apple-\nworking-on-fix-for-iphone-alarm-issue/'), locked out of Apple account\n('https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/27/apple-id-accounts-logging-out-users/'),\nSiri on HomePod can't tell you the time,....
