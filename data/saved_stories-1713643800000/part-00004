He does\nstreet interviews with Gen Z\u2019s.\n\nI was watching one of his most popular videos and I realised towards the end\nthat it was actually an ad. It blended in so well that I needed to write a\npost!\n\nThe video in question:\n\n> @johnrusanov\n>\n> How many did you get correct? @gauthofficial\n>\n> #gauth\n>\n> #ai\n>\n> #college\n>\n> #schoolhack\n>\n> #studyhack\n>\n> \u266c original sound - John Rusanov\n\nTake note that the video predominantly follows the same pattern as his prior\nones. It\u2019s only in the closing segments where he introduces the sponsored app.\nThat way, viewers are hooked onto the video, and will now want to watch to its\nconclusion.\n\nProduct selection is key. Gauth\u2019s target audience is the same as John\u2019s - Gen\nZ\u2019s who are either in school or university.\n\nThe transition to the sponsored content is very smooth as well. Why? Because\nJohn chose the right topic for this video - math and history quizzes, which is\nexactly what the app helps with.\n\nThe result - 74 million views, an engaged audience, and a happy sponsor.\n\nHiya!
