That changed the day I finally\nrealised that what they say is true: you only live once.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a passionate person. I knew exactly what I wanted, and I knew\nthe challenges and sacrifices I was willing to make to achieve my ultimate\ngoal. I knew I wanted to be a CFO; it had been my dream job since I started\nworking in the corporate world, probably even before that. I joined Microsoft\nwhen I was 26 years old, and for 12 years, I gave it my all while also having\nthe time of my life. I had finally reached my final destination and was having\na blast. For a time, it felt like I was on top of the world, and I could have\nprobably kept on being the CFO at Microsoft Portugal for quite some time. But\nwhen you have experienced loss, the greatest of losses, you realise every\nmoment counts.\n\n> Today, I know I\u2019m no longer a CFO and don\u2019t want to return to being a CFO.\n> I\u2019ve completely accepted and embraced the fact that this chapter of my life\n> is over, and I\u2019m extremely happy with the place I am at.\n\nI was about 24 years old when I first saw what it was like to lose it all in\nthe blink of an eye as I watched a football player fall, lifeless, during a\nmatch. He never got up again. That was the first step for me to realise that\nsomething in my life had to change. Two years after that, at 27, I lost my\nfather. That traumatic experience made it clear that my life, my family, my\nhobbies and above all else, achieving financial independence to leave the\ncorporate world was a must. So, I started planning.\n\nI understood that I would have to retire at the age of 50 to be able to enjoy\nthe time I had with the people I loved and do the things that brought me joy\nwhile I still had the health to be able to experience them fully. I came up\nwith a plan to achieve financial independence, which meant a lot of savings,\nnot a lot of spending, but also a lot of investments that would secure my\nfinancial well-being. I continued to forge my path and worked across the world\nto get there, developing new skills and competences, growing my career and\nalways aiming for the next big move until I got to the place I wanted to be.\n\nAs a CFO, I had all the necessary resources at my disposal. I had the power to\ninfluence how things would happen, design strategies, and decide where we\nwould move first. When you\u2019re sitting at a table with the Board of Directors,\nand they ask you what to do, that\u2019s an amazing feeling, right? But after five\nyears, it was time to consider a change. But not the change some would expect.\n\nWhen I considered my next career shift, I looked at my career development\nplan, it said enter a larger market like Asia-Pacific. I started considering\nmy options until one day, I kept thinking to myself, \u201cAm I doing this just to\ncheck a list? What competencies will I develop here that I haven\u2019t got yet?\u201d,\nand the more I thought about it, the more I knew it wouldn\u2019t bring me any\nhappiness, not anymore. If I had Microsoft\u2019s CEO telling me I could choose any\njob in the world, and it would be mine, I wouldn\u2019t be able to pick one. And\nfor me, that was a problem. If I couldn\u2019t even fathom the idea of choosing any\njob Microsoft had to offer in the world, maybe that meant my next step was\nout.\n\nI discussed it with my family, and we collectively agreed that it was finally\ntime to settle down after a life of travelling across the world for our\ncareers. At this point, at 44 years old, I knew all my efforts had paid off,\nas I had already achieved my financial independence. I knew that if I left the\ncorporate world, I still had the means to sustain myself and the people I love\nmost, to maintain my lifestyle and, most importantly, I could finally take\ncontrol of my time. And so, I did. Working in the corporate world wasn\u2019t\nmaking me smile anymore, therefore I just had to realise that it was a hell of\na run, but no longer what I wanted.\n\nI was lucky to have the best support system. Everyone around me knew what I\nhad been through, and it was no secret that I wanted to retire earlier. It\ndidn\u2019t stop them from asking if I was sure I was making the right decision and\nif this was what I wanted. Well, that and my daughter asking if we were going\nto be poor now that I wouldn\u2019t have a job anymore. It\u2019s funny to see how kids\u2019\nminds work and how they apply the values we instilled in them. Throughout her\nlife, my child always knew it was important to have a job that would bring you\nhappiness but also a good salary, to look at money not as something you should\nbe afraid of, but to talk about it and manage it correctly. She knew that not\nhaving a job meant you would be in financial trouble. When she became\nconcerned, I used Monopoly as a comparison, so, for her, Mommy is playing\nreal-life Monopoly now.\n\n> If I had Microsoft\u2019s CEO telling me I could choose any job in the world, and\n> it would be mine, I wouldn\u2019t be able to pick one. And for me, that was a\n> problem.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, there were a lot of mixed feelings. When I\njoined as the CFO of Microsoft Portugal, I made it very clear that I would\nretire at 50, and on the one hand, some people would tell me that I would\neventually change my mind, that I was too young to retire and I wouldn\u2019t be\nable to leave the corporate world behind. While others would show their full\nsupport and say, \u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t sound like such a bad idea. Maybe I\nshould do the same!\u201d.\n\nWhen I came forward and told my manager I planned on retiring earlier than\nexpected, she stood by my side until the very last day. We worked on a\nsuccession plan together, ensuring all loose ends were tied and the transition\nwould be a smooth sailing experience for everyone involved. Then, it was time\nto set a date: July 17th would be my last day at Microsoft Portugal, my last\nday as a CFO, and the start of my second life.\n\nI chose that date as it was the day we planned to have our all-employee\u2019s year\nend meeting. Having everyone together in the same meeting allowed me the\nopportunity to say goodbye to the team, thank them for their support and show\nhow happy I had been to work alongside such a great group of inspiring\nindividuals. I even bought some champagne bottles. And the best gift I got\nthat day was a standing ovation from everyone in the room. More than any gift,\nflowers, or anything I could have gotten, seeing a room full of people\nstanding up, clapping, and cheering for my new chance at life was surreal.\nIt\u2019s a moment I\u2019ll cherish forever.\n\nI went through the motions of finishing everything I still needed to do, and\nit felt just like any other day. I had meetings in the morning and prepared\nthe pitch for the presentation. Right before closing my laptop, I sent an\nemail to the team, which I had been drafting for six months. I wanted to thank\neveryone, and it was really overwhelming when you consider all the people you\ncrossed paths with over 18 years. In the end, I didn\u2019t mention any names, but\neveryone in general, as I truly believed each and everyone had made a\ndifference in my journey, somehow. I also wanted to ensure I had the right\ntone to make people understand that my decision was for personal reasons, not\nbecause I didn\u2019t love my job or the company. Microsoft is the best company to\nwork for, I just didn\u2019t want to work anymore.\n\n> There was this one time when someone asked me what my title was, and that\u2019s\n> probably the moment I first realised things had changed.\n\nAfter that, it was time to go. I finally closed my laptop for the last time\nand dropped it off alongside my badge, car keys and even my phone. It was\nprobably around that time that I started to consider how things were about to\nchange. As I left the building for the last time, I was also taking the very\nfirst step into my second life, and I remember thinking, \u201cI need to leave with\nmy right foot ahead\u201d and so I did. A sense of freedom washed over me as I\nwalked through those glass doors. I didn\u2019t dwell a lot on it because this\nwasn\u2019t a time to be sad but about celebrating all the hard work and\nperseverance it took to get here. There\u2019s always a sense of nostalgia, but\nwhenever I felt it, I knew it was about saying goodbye to the past and\nembracing the future and this new adventure I was about to start.\n\nBut not everything in life is just sunshine and rainbows, and while I\u2019ve known\nfor most of my career that this day was about to come, there were times when\nfear and uncertainty crept in. You start wondering if the pros outweigh the\ncons if you\u2019re up for it, and, most importantly, what you are going to do\nafterwards. And we have society and our culture to thank for that.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that being a CFO carries a lot of weight. There\u2019s a lot of\nresponsibility but also a great status, and when you know you\u2019re about to lose\nit, it feels like you\u2019re going through a break, like you are distancing from\nsomeone you loved, but you have grown apart. In the months I was planning my\nexit, it was hard to manage those emotions, anticipating what would happen and\nhow those around me would perceive me after I stopped being a CFO. I wondered\nhow I would have to act, if society would still find me relevant, if people\nwould be happy to see me or if, up until then, they had just been friendly\nbecause of my position.\n\n> The question of purpose is also a hard pill to swallow. What happens when\n> you\u2019re back home with no job, routine, or idea of what to do next?\n\nThere was this one time when someone asked me what my title was, and that\u2019s\nprobably the moment I first realised things had changed. I was no longer Rita\nPi\u00e7arra, CFO at Microsoft Portugal, so what should I be? Ex-CFO, Former CFO? I\nwas now a mother, surfer, traveller, public speaker, and writer. But was that\nenough for others? Was any of these a good enough title to be accepted in\nsociety?\n\nThe question of your purpose is also a hard pill to swallow. I knew my\nimmediate plans: I would be on vacation with my family, but what then? What\nhappens when you\u2019re back home with no job, routine, or idea of what to do\nnext? I knew I wanted to help people somehow, but no one needed me, right? No\none needed me to approve budgets or do an ROI analysis, so would they need me\nfor anything else?\n\nThe months leading up to this decision and my resignation were probably the\nhardest I experienced. It became especially harder when I talked about it with\nclose friends who had also retired and ended up severely depressed due to\ntheir lack of purpose. I didn\u2019t want that for myself. I didn\u2019t want to retire\nand take the stress of the corporate world off my shoulders just to become\nanxious and depressed.\n\nSo, I started doing therapy, which helped me understand how to deal with these\nquestions and shift my focus from the things I was losing to the ones I was\ngaining. I had to distance myself from the Rita I was before and focus on\neverything this new version of Rita was now free to do. I also understood that\nthe day you leave, there will be someone there doing your job the next day,\nprobably even better than you, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard acceptance because I\u2019ve always been very ambitious. To say, \u201cThis\nis it, the end of your journey,\u201d is a huge step, especially for those in the\ncorporate world. So, it wasn\u2019t something I could decide and adapt to in 3\nseconds, like choosing an ice cream flavour you don\u2019t like but must suck it up\nand deal with the consequences. This was a major life decision, so it took me\na while to reach the right mindset and take that step to start this new\nchapter of my story. And now I know, without a doubt, it was the best decision\nI could have made.\n\n> I also understood that the day you leave, there will always be someone there\n> doing your job the next day, probably even better than you, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t expect my life to take the turn it did. Right after I returned\nfrom vacation at the end of August, I was invited by Expresso, a Portuguese\nnewspaper, to be a guest in one of their podcasts. At first, I wanted to say\nno, as the title was \u201cO CEO \u00e9 o limite\u201d, which in English stands for something\nlike \u201cThe CEO is the limit\u201d, and I was not a CEO, I didn\u2019t want to be known as\none, I had just retired, I just wanted to be Rita, the mother, the traveller,\nthe surfer, for a minute. It took a while, but the journalist finally\nconvinced me to tell my story. Little did I know...\n\nWhen I woke up, I discovered that the interview had gone viral. This event\nseemed to have shifted the world around me. Even though my friends and family\nremained the same, people started behaving differently. Now, I am the one who\nretired at the age of 44, even though I am still the same person. People just\nlook at me differently, which is still a bit weird. Following that instead of\nfalling into a depression, I almost drowned in the tsunami of messages and\ninvitations I received, and at one point, it felt like I was working more than\nwhen I was at Microsoft.\n\nBut even though I don\u2019t love the public exposure I\u2019ve gotten from it, I\u2019m\nwilling to pay that price, as it has guided me on to my new purpose in life.\nGuiding and inspiring people to take control over their lives, careers and\nfinances to ensure they\u2019re working but also enjoying everything life has to\noffer. I still don\u2019t know, to this day, if I\u2019ll stay in the spotlight, but I\nknow that the moment I leave, my voice won\u2019t reach as many people as I wish\nto, so I need to strike that balance.\n\nToday, I know I\u2019m no longer a CFO and don\u2019t want to return to being a CFO.\nI\u2019ve completely accepted and embraced the fact that this chapter of my life is\nover, and there won\u2019t be any more 9 to 5 jobs on my horizon, and I\u2019m extremely\nhappy with the place I am today. Because I know that if I ever went back, even\nfor a short period of time and a great compensation, I wouldn\u2019t be happy. For\nnow, all I want is to go back to surfing, having fun, travelling, helping\nothers, and being in full control of my agenda.\n\n## Like this story?\n\n### Share it with the world\n\n## Related posts\n\n2023-09-25\n\nLeadership\n\n### Beyond Balance Sheets: Roy Hefer's Innovative Journey as a CFO\n\nAna Gordo\n\nEditorial Writer @Rydoo\n\nDeep dive into modern finance by exploring Roy Hefer\u2019s CFO journey at\nTravelPerk, from evolving roles and AI\u2019s influence to IPO insights.\n\n2023-09-25\n\n2023-09-19\n\nLeadership + Operations\n\n### The new era of talent retention: cutting costs while putting people first\n\nAna Gordo\n\nEditorial Writer @Rydoo\n\nRedefining cost-saving with a people-centric approach, discover how the modern\ndynamics of talent nurture and retention take centre stage.\n\n2023-09-19\n\n2023-09-13\n\nLeadership + Strategy\n\n### Beyond the Rule of 40: go profitable or go home\n\nSebastien Marchon\n\nCEO @Rydoo\n\nFrom tulip bubbles to AI: Navigating the era where \u2018go profitable or go home\u2019\ndefines investment beyond the Rule of 40.\n\n2023-09-13\n\nSee more\n\n### Share\n\nYour go-to resource for finance topics.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rydoo\n\nLess admin.
