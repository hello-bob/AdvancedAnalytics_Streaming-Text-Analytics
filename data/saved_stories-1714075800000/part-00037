Its own\nbill for landmark trials of a four-drug combination treatment for drug-\nresistant tuberculosis came to \u20ac34m (\u00a329m).\n\nCurrent estimates for research and development of new medicines range from\n\u20ac40m to \u20ac3.9bn. The extortionate cost of trials is used to justify high prices\nof new medicines, but companies do not publish either the topline or a\nbreakdown of their spending. MSF says this opacity should end. It has produced\na toolkit for drug trialists, which categorises each item of expenditure and\nallows the costs to be collated throughout the process, which can last for\nyears.\n\nMSF\u2019s trial, called TB Practecal, has transformed prospects for people with\ndrug-resistant forms of TB, which have high mortality rates and in some\ncountries have been untreatable because of the high price of the few drugs\nthat still work.\n\nDr Bern-Thomas Nyang\u2019wa, MSF\u2019s medical director and the chief investigator of\nthe trial, said: \u201cWe hope that our disclosure of clinical trial costs for\nidentifying an improved regimen for drug-resistant tuberculosis will serve as\na clarion call for other public and nonprofit actors to join us and publicly\nshare their clinical trial costs to ensure broader transparency in medical R&D\ncosts.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe encourage clinical trial sponsors and implementors to try our\nTransparency Core toolkit, and to build on it as a guide to facilitate the\npublication of cost data. While transparency in R&D expenditure remains\nlargely elusive, transparency in clinical trial costs is a transformative step\ntowards exposing what medical innovation actually costs and building a future\nwhere access to medicines and medical tools is not hindered by high prices.\u201d\n\nThe MSF says it hopes its disclosure will act as a \u2018clarion call\u2019 for the\nindustry.

The\noutlook for patients with drug-resistant TB has been bleak in middle and low-\nincome countries. Even if alternative drugs were available, they had to be\ntaken regularly for an entire year.\n\nBedaquiline, a new drug with a different mechanism against drug-resistant TB,\nwas developed by Johnson & Johnson and, in 2012, became the first TB drug to\nbe approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US in 40 years. But the\ncost was prohibitive for many of the worst-affected countries. It took a long\nbattle by campaigners to get the price reduced. The cost of R&D was a key\nfactor. Eventually, it was revealed by academics that the drug was developed\nthanks to public funding, which was five times more than private investment.\n\nMSF trialled the use of a combination of four oral drugs, including\nbedaquiline, against drug-resistant TB. Its success led to the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) recommending six months\u2019 treatment with the combination for\nrifampicin-resistant TB. It is now in use in 40 countries.\n\nRoz Scourse, a policy adviser with MSF\u2019s Access Campaign, said: \u201cThe global\nmovement that pushed for a significant price reduction of the lifesaving TB\ndrug bedaquiline demonstrated that transparency of R&D costs can lead to\nincreased access to medical tools and help save more lives.\n\nSouth Africans take on big pharma for access to \u2018miracle\u2019 cystic fibrosis drug\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cThe unsubstantiated yet dominant narrative that high prices are needed to\nrecoup high R&D costs can no longer remain an evidence-free zone \u2013 this\ninformation is a critical piece of the policy puzzle that can inform the price\nof medical products, and who gets access.\u201d\n\nMSF\u2019s paper, presented Thursday at a WHO conference on medicines pricing,\nshowed it was possible to collect good data on spending in trials, Scourse\nsaid. She urged public disclosure, so that governments and communities can\nhave the evidence they need to discuss pricing and work towards access for all\nthose who need the medicines.\n\nAlthough MSF\u2019s trials took place in middle-income countries, the costs were\nnot low, said Scourse, because they had to invest substantial sums to upgrade\ninfrastructure \u2013 such as TB clinics \u2013 to be able to conduct high-quality\nresearch.\n\nStaff at a clinic in Uzbekistan where the MSF\u2019s TB Pracetcal treatment was\ntrialled.

This can only be achieved by recognising the\nvalue of medicines, while engaging in dialogue on how to make innovations more\naffordable and accessible to all.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Global development\n  * Fair Access\n  * Global health\n  * Health\n  * Pharmaceuticals industry\n  * Tuberculosis\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
