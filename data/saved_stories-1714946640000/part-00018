All punctuation, including\napostrophes, shall be avoided.\u2019\n\nLast year book retailer Waterstones sparked considerable debate after removing\nthe punctuation from its brand name.\n\n## Sign Up for News Updates\n\n### Get your need-to-know latest news, feel-good stories, analysis and more\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nShare this article via whatsappShare this article via twitterCopy linkShare\nthis article via facebook\n\n##### Share this with\n\nShare this article via messengerShare this article via emailShare this article\nvia smsShare this article via flipboard\n\nComment\n\nShare this article via commentCommentShare this article via twitterShare this\narticle via whatsapp\n\nMORE\n\nBizarre\n\n  * ### Maps show how much the Conservatives were battered across UK local elections\n\n  * ### Schoolgirl, 10, dies in house fire as police give major update on Bradford blaze\n\n  * ### Travel chaos for Bank Holiday revellers heading home from weekend getaways\n\n  * ### 'Hero' dad who protected family from Hainault sword attacker reunited with daughter\n\nMust read\n\n  1. ## Boy, 14, dead after man goes on sword rampage against random people\n\n'The King has asked to be kept fully informed as details of the incident\nbecome clearer.'\n\n  2. ## Kate shares new photo of smiling Charlotte to celebrate her ninth birthday\n\nKate Middleton took a new picture of her daughter Princess Charlotte to mark\nher birthday.\n\n  3. ## Man found partially buried dies after being allegedly tortured at a farm\n\nNow two people have been charged with murder.\n\n  4. ## Drivers are getting their knickers in a twist over the width of this new cycle path\n\nApparently it's bad that a single road lane is narrower than a multi-user path\nwhich allows both pedestrians and cyclists to travel in two directions.\n\n  5. ## This new period swimwear can hold the equivalent of eight tampons\n\nHas your period landed on your sunshine holiday?
