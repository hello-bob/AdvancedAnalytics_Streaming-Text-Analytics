Discovery\n\nWatch on\n\nby do son \u00b7 April 11, 2024\n\nA critical vulnerability has been identified in popular versions of Apache\nKafka, the widely used open-source event streaming platform. This flaw\n(CVE-2024-27309) could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data during the\nprocess of migrating a Kafka cluster from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode,\npotentially impacting numerous large-scale enterprises.\n\nThe CVE-2024-27309 Vulnerability Explained\n\nNormally, Apache Kafka relies on Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage\npermissions and secure resources. However, this vulnerability triggers a\nscenario where ACLs aren\u2019t always enforced correctly during the migration\nprocess. Under specific conditions, the removal of an ACL could lead Kafka to\nincorrectly treat a resource as having fewer ACL restrictions than it actually\ndoes.\n\nWho\u2019s Affected\n\nThis critical vulnerability exists in the following Apache Kafka versions:\n\n  * 3.5.0, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.6.0, 3.6.1\n\nImportantly, thousands of companies around the world, including over 80% of\nFortune 100 companies, rely on Apache Kafka for data-intensive applications.\n\nThe Consequences\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability depends heavily on the specific ACLs an\norganization has configured. Here\u2019s the potential fallout:\n\n  * Availability Issues: If only \u201cALLOW\u201d ACLs were in use, the biggest concern may be unauthorized users causing disruptions.\n  * Data Confidentiality Breach: If \u201cDENY\u201d ACLs were in place, a more serious consequence is possible. Unauthorized parties might gain access to sensitive data that should have been restricted.\n  * Data Integrity at Risk Depending on how sensitive data is used within the Kafka system, a malicious attacker could even potentially manipulate data, undermining its integrity.\n\nThe Fix\n\nOrganizations using the affected Kafka versions are strongly urged to patch\ntheir systems immediately. Fortunately, the fix appears relatively\nstraightforward, and the vulnerability can also be mitigated by ensuring\ncertain conditions are met during the migration.\n\nA Call to Action\n\nThis vulnerability highlights the importance of timely patching, even for\nwidely trusted software like Apache Kafka. Businesses must remain vigilant and\ntake swift action to safeguard their data from potential exploits.\n\nTags: Apache KafkaCVE-2024-27309\n\n  * Previous story Bitdefender Patches Critical Vulnerabilities in GravityZone and Endpoint Security\n\nFollow:\n\n### Search\n\n  * Popular Posts\n  * Tags\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\nCVE-2024-27309: Major Apache Kafka Flaw Could Expose Sensitive Data in Popular\nEnterprises\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\nSAP Security Patch Day: CVE-2024-22127 \u2013 Critical Vulnerability Demand\nImmediate Action\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\nNo More Patches: D-Link DIR-822 Vulnerable to Remote Takeovers\n(CVE-2024-25331)\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\nCVE-2024-22144: Critical Flaw in Popular WordPress Security Plugin Exposes\n200,000+ Sites\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\n  * Malware\n\nVCURMS: New Java RATs Unleashed in Sophisticated Phishing Scheme\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\n  * active directory android Apple backdoor BurpSuite chrome CISA cisco cyberattack Data Breach facebook gitlab google google chrome hacker kali linux Linux Linux Kernel malware metasploit Microsoft nmap OSINT penetration testing Pentesting PoC powershell privilege escalation Python ransomware shodan sqli sql injection sqlmap ssh Ubuntu vmware Vulnerability web app webapp pentest webshell windows wireless wordpress XSS\n\nReward\n\n### Brilliantly\n\nSAFE!\n\nsecurityonline.info\n\n### Content & Links\n\nVerified by Sur.ly\n\n2022\n\n### Website\n\n  1.
