Delta launched Wednesday as one of\nthe first officially approved iOS apps to emulate Nintendo consoles from the\nNES through the N64 and the Game Boy through the Nintendo DS (though\nunofficial options have snuck through in the past).\n\n### Further Reading\n\nApple removes the first iOS Game Boy emulator released under new App Store\nrules\n\nDelta is an outgrowth of developer Riley Testut's earlier sideloadable GBA4iOS\nproject, which recently had its own unauthorized clone removed from the App\nStore. Before Wednesday, iOS users could load Delta onto their devices only\nthrough AltStore, an iOS marketplace that used a Developer Mode workaround to\nsideload apps from a self-hosted server. European users can now get that\nAltStore directly on their iOS devices (for a small 1.50 euro/year fee), while\nNorth American users can simply download Delta for free from the iOS App\nStore, with no ads or user tracking to boot.\n\nAll that history means Delta is far from a slapdash app quickly thrown\ntogether to take advantage of Apple's new openness to emulation. The app is\nobviously built with iOS in mind and already integrates some useful features\ndesigned for the mobile ecosystem. While there are some updates we'd like to\nsee in the future, this represents a good starting point for where Apple-\napproved game emulation can go on iOS.\n\n## Get a real controller\n\nThe biggest issue with Delta\u2014as with practically any other smartphone-based\nretro emulator\u2014is trying to control the emulation with touchscreen controls.\nTapping on a flat, undifferentiated screen can provide a passable experience\nwhen playing turn-based RPGs or tactical sims, we suppose. But any game that\nrequires even the faintest hint of reflexes suffers greatly without the\nimmediate tactile feedback you get from physical buttons, d-pads, and analog\nsticks.\n\n  * A cute pink default skin for the Nintendo DS.\n\nDelta\n\n  * It's a bit awkward having the DS' two screens next to each other in landscape mode, but it works alright.\n\nDelta\n\n  * Pretty sure a portable SNES was something I literally dreamed about as a child.\n\nDelta\n\n  * The on-screen buttons can't help but be a little distracting.\n\nDelta\n\n  * The purple of my youth.\n\nDelta\n\n  * The opacity of the on-screen buttons can be modified in the menu.\n\nDelta\n\n  * That is one crowded control surface.\n\nDelta\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nTo its credit, Delta does its best to ameliorate this inherent issue. The use\nof Haptic Touch (on supported iOS devices) provides a subtle vibration every\ntime your thumb finds a new virtual \"button\" on the touch screen, which helps\nat least a little bit when blindly hunting during action sequences. Delta's\nmenus also include the (somewhat buried) ability to automatically hold down\nspecifics buttons without physical input, which can be especially useful for\nracing game accelerators or run buttons in platform games. We'd love to see\nthis feature expanded even further to support an auto-fire option for shoot-\nem-ups and other games that require a lot of repetitive button presses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when it come to aesthetics, Delta lets users download a number of\ncommunity-made \"controller skins\" to jazz up the default look of the on-screen\ncontrollers (which even work in landscape mode). It's a cute feature, but we'd\nhave much preferred an option to physically move the on-screen buttons to\ndifferent areas of the screen, which could help a lot for some specific games.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nGuidemaster: Game controllers to turn your smartphone into a mobile gaming\nmachine\n\nDespite these kinds of touch-control features, by far the best experience you\ncan have with Delta is with some sort of external, physical controller.\nLuckily, iOS now supports a wide range of custom MFi controllers or generic\nbluetooth console controllers with a minimum of hassle.\n\nEnlarge / If you can use a controller like this with Delta, do so.\n\nKyle Orland\n\nWhen I plugged a PS5 DualSense controller into my iPad with a USB cable, Delta\ndetected it automatically and removed the on-screen control overlay instantly.\nOddly, though, the default button mapping settings were not set to correctly\nmatch the appropriate SNES face buttons to the corresponding PS5 buttons. I\nhad to dive deep into the settings menus to remap the controls and do so again\nafter I hooked up an Xbox One gamepad via bluetooth.\n\nOnce that was done, though, the external controllers felt appropriately snappy\nand natural. With a cheap phone mount snapped to the controller, Delta can\nturn your iPhone into a pretty convenient and capable retro machine.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n31\n\nKyle Orland Kyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica\nsince 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind\nvideo games.
