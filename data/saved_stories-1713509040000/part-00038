But the\nclock was ticking for Intuitive Machines' Odysseus spacecraft after touching\ndown on February 22 near the Moon's south pole.\n\nEach day and night on the Moon lasts two weeks. When the Sun sets, a solar-\npowered lunar lander like Odysseus is starved of energy. Temperatures during\nthe lunar night plummet, bottoming out at around minus 280\u00b0 Fahrenheit (minus\n173\u00b0 Celsius).\n\nOver the course of two weeks, these cold temperatures can damage sensitive\nspacecraft equipment, killing a lander even if it could start generating power\nagain at lunar sunrise. Surviving the night requires heat and electricity, and\nNASA officials say nuclear power is one of the most attractive solutions to\nthis problem.\n\n## Freezing to death\n\n\u201cWe do anticipate having to deploy nuclear systems on the lunar surface,\" said\nJay Jenkins, program executive for NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services\n(CLPS) program.\n\n\"Honestly, it\u2019s not unrealistic that we\u2019ll want to do be able to do this\nwithin five years or less. We are starting to buy payloads that are meant for\ninvestigations that go beyond one lunar day,\" Jenkins said during a Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission conference earlier this month.\n\nThe commercial Odysseus lander was part of CLPS. Intuitive Machines had a $118\nmillion contract with NASA to deliver science and tech demo payloads to the\nlunar surface.\n\nAs expected, Intuitive Machines declared the end of the Odysseus mission last\nmonth when ground teams confirmed that the lander did not make it through the\nnight. Just in case it woke up, engineers tried listening for a signal from\nthe spacecraft, nicknamed Odie, but didn't hear back.\n\n\"This confirms that Odie has permanently faded after cementing its legacy into\nhistory as the first commercial lunar lander to land on the Moon,\" Intuitive\nMachines posted on X.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause of the extreme temperatures through the lunar night, typically, you\ndon\u2019t come back to life,\" said Peter McGrath, chief operating officer of\nIntuitive Machines, before the launch of Odysseus last month. \"The batteries\ndon\u2019t survive, the boards crack on the computers and the avionics boxes, and\neven though you may be able to collect power through the solar arrays, you\nreally don\u2019t have anything that functions, so we\u2019ve been looking at how to\nkeep landers alive.\u201d\n\nIndia's Chandrayaan 3 lander also didn't make it past its first lunar day\nafter it arrived on the Moon last August. There are exceptions, though.\nJapan's SLIM lander touched down on the Moon in January and is still alive,\neven though Japanese engineers expected it would succumb to cold temperatures\nduring its first lunar night. Japan's space agency said some temperature\nsensors and unused battery cells on SLIM are starting to malfunction, but the\n\"majority of functions\" have survived so far.\n\nThe first phase of America's return to the Moon, initially consisting of\nrobotic commercial missions and then larger human-rated landers, will have the\nsame limitations as Odysseus. The next series of commercial landers set to\nlaunch to the Moon under contract with NASA are all designed to operate for\none lunar day. The first human landing on the Moon under NASA's Artemis\nprogram, Artemis III, will spend up to six days on the lunar surface. The\nastronauts won't stay the night.\n\nEnlarge / Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lander is shown shortly before touching\ndown on the Moon.\n\nIntuitive Machines\n\nNASA's long-term goal is to build a sustainable presence on the lunar surface.\nMission lifetimes of one or two weeks won't cut it for a Moon base.\n\n\"Right now, all the CLPS deliveries basically land at lunar morning and they\nend at lunar evening,\" Jenkins said. \"That\u2019s very very limiting, especially\nfor experiments that we would like to go for a very long time, for months or\nyears, in order to monitor geophysical properties, or in order to monitor\nvarious other aspects of the Moon.\"\n\nNASA also wants to venture into permanently shadowed craters at the Moon's\nsouth pole. The bottoms of these craters haven't seen sunlight for billions of\nyears, and observations from orbit suggest these cold traps harbor water ice,\na valuable resource for future lunar explorers.\n\n\u201cSo survive-the-night capability, or STN, is very highly desirable,\" Jenkins\nsaid.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n162\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
