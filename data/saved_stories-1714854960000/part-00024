Hundreds of\nthousands of fake brand named sport shoes were reportedly among the seized\nparcels.\n\nThe investigation into Pandabuy, first publicised by World Trademark Review,\nreportedly began last November with the cooperation of City of London police\nand several intellectual property protection firms including Corsearch, Rouse,\nand Rouse\u2019s China-based strategic partner Lusheng Law Firm.\n\nThe UK involvement is reportedly under the police intellectual property crime\nunit\u2019s long-running Operation Ashiko, which focuses on online intellectual\nproperty crime and counterfeit sales.\n\nPandabuy logo\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that collaboration between brand owners, law\nenforcement, law firms and service providers across the world has resulted in\naction against a counterfeit shopping agent of this scale,\u201d Detective\nInspector Andrew Masterson told World Trademark Review.\n\nChina-based IPP firm Cantoop separately said it had alerted police in\nNovember, on behalf of unnamed brand owners, and provided 70 investigators to\nassist with the probe.\n\n\u201cAfter six months of diligent work, it was discovered that the infringing\nactivities of Pandabuy extended to five cities in China, involving over 2,200\nemployees, with warehouses spanning 100,000 square metres, equivalent to\nnearly 20 football stadiums,\u201d Cantoop alleged.\n\nAn officer at a Shanghai police economic crime desk the raid had taken place\nbut declined to give the Guardian further details, only saying that \u201cnot so\nmany\u201d people had been arrested.\n\nPandabuy is a shopping agent platform, acting as a conduit between sellers and\nbuyers, providing sales and marketing assistance, and shipping processes. It\ndoes not make the items, but has become famous as a source of cheap and\nallegedly fake designer goods. Influencers and customers regularly post videos\nof their Pandabuy \u201chauls\u201d on TikTok, Discord, and other social media\nplatforms.\n\nPandabuy\u2019s website claims to have 200,000 customers, however a major data leak\nin March reportedly included details for more than 1.3 million customers.\nPandabuy apologised for the leak, which it blamed on criminal hackers, and\nsaid people\u2019s financial information was not accessed.\n\nPandabuy has been contacted for comment. The website\u2019s public alert notices\nhave not been updated since 1 April, but an autogenerated email reply suggests\nthe company is still operating in a limited capacity.\n\n\u201cRecently, our company has encountered legal issues related to our services,\nas our senior management is actively cooperating with the police\ninvestigation,\u201d the reply said.\n\n\u201cCurrently, we are fully collaborating with the relevant authorities to ensure\nthat all our business activities comply with legal regulations ... In the\nmeantime, our team and the authorities are taking every necessary measure to\nprotect your rights and ensure data security.\u201d\n\nSome customers who say they are awaiting packages have posted online claiming\nthey have been given conflicting messages by customer service about whether\nshipments ordered prior to the raids will be sent out. Cantoop\u2019s statement\nsuggested authorities expected to spend months inspecting the contents of the\nraided warehouses.\n\n\u201cAll infringing products will be confiscated and stored in warehouses\ndesignated by law enforcement agencies,\u201d it said.\n\nUK police told Bloomberg further action was expected against UK assets of\nPandabuy, which lists a mail drop business centre address in London as its\nheadquarters.\n\nChi Hui Lin contributed to this report\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * China\n  * Intellectual property\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
