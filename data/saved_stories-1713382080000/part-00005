English is\nconsidered a major target as well. The design tries to enforce the alternating\nusage of both hands to increase typing speed. It is based on ideas from de-\nergo and other ergonomic layouts. The high frequency keys are placed in the\nhome row. The current layout Neo 2.0 has unique features not present in other\nlayouts, making it suited for many target groups such as programmers,\nmathematicians, scientists and LaTeX authors.^[4] Neo is grouped in different\nlayers, each designed for a special purpose.\n\nMost special characters inherit the meaning of the lower layers\u2014the \u27e8\u00bf\u27e9\ncharacter is one layer above the \u27e8?\u27e9, or the Greek \u27e8\u03b1\u27e9 is above the \u27e8a\u27e9\ncharacter. Neo uses a total of six layers with the following general\nuse:^[5]^[6]\n\n  1. Lowercase characters\n  2. Uppercase characters, typographical characters\n  3. Special characters for programming, etc.\n  4. WASD-like movement keys and number block\n  5. Greek characters\n  6. Mathematical symbols and Greek uppercase characters\n\n## Concept[edit]\n\n### Facilitating Ten Finger Writing[edit]\n\nNeo keyboard, produced 2017\n\nOn the basis of the statistical distribution of letters of the German language\nand research on ergonomics, the neo-keyboard layout aims to shorten the finger\nmovements during writing. The most common letters are therefore on the\nbaseline and the fast index and middle fingers. This allows more words to be\nwritten without leaving the baseline compared to other keyboard layouts.\n\nFor an average German-language text 63% of all letters can be typed from the\nbaseline with fingers on the home row - in contrast to 25% in the usual\nQWERTZ-layout.^[7]\n\nIn addition, using Neo the hands shall alternate as often as possible during\nwriting and their use be evenly distributed - the QWERTY keyboard layout is\nvery left-heavy.\n\nThe drafting of the letter positions took into account the experience from\nother keyboard layout reforms. Instead of pursuing a purely mathematical or\nexperimental path, Neo combines the insights of both paths with the goal of\nimproving both the ergonomics and memorization of the keyboard layout.\n\n### Layers[edit]\n\nNeo 2 has a total of six levels. The first two levels correspond to the German\nlowercase and uppercase letters and can be reached by switching as usual\nlayouts. The third level can be reached via the Mod3 , which under QWERTZ\ncorresponds to the Caps Lock key and the # key, and contains common\npunctuation and special characters. Binary and trigrams, which are commonly\nused in programming, in wikis, when chatting, or in the command line of common\noperating systems, have been taken into account in the design of this level.\n\nThe fourth level can be reached via Mod4 , which under QWERTZ corresponds to\nthe Alt Gr key and the < key, contains a numeric keypad and important\nnavigation keys, so you do not have to take your hands off the main field to\nnavigate in a text document. By making the navigation buttons accessible on\nthe main panel, Neo also encounters the criticism expressed in reform\nkeyboards that text editors like Vim would be more difficult to use. This\nlevel can be locked just like the second one.\n\nThe levels five ( Shift + Mod3 ) and six ( Mod3 + Mod4 ) finally contain small\nand capital letters in Greek as well as other mathematical and scientific\nsigns.\n\n### Character variety and typography[edit]\n\nNeo allows the writing of virtually all languages with Latin-based alphabet,\nin particular because of the dead keys and additional Compose combinations, of\nwhich Neo brings many of its own. The dead keys are located at the top left\nand right and allow combining the following characters with the corresponding\ndiacritic when hitting the key.\n\nThus, not only grave, acute and circumflex, but also many other diacritics\nsuch as the ring, breve and macron are possible, including the novel dead\nbutton \"turning\" \u21bb , for example, from the sign a one can create an \u0250.\nTogether with the fifth level, Neo can be used to create Greek as well as\ninternational phonetic alphabet symbols. Nevertheless Neo is clearly designed\nfor the German language; for others a change in programming is necessary.\n\nFurthermore, meaningful Unicode characters were placed on the keyboard for\nwhich otherwise a character table would have to suffice, or which would\notherwise not be so easy to achieve. These characters include the common\nquotes (\"...\"), the dash (-), the real apostrophe (') and the chevrons\ncommonly used in books and newspapers (\u00ab \u00bb). In addition, the Capital \u1e9e,\nstandardized in June 2008, is also available.\n\n### Mathematics and special characters[edit]\n\nOn the levels five and six one reaches the Greek letters and numerous\ncharacters required for the formula theorem, for example symbols for sets ( ,\n, \u2229 , \u222a , \u2282 ), logic ( \u00ac , \u2228 , \u2227 , \u21d4 ), derivatives ( \u2202 , \u2207 ), and many more.\nBy means of the Compose key, for example, the sequence Compose + = + \u2282 can be\nused to generate the subset symbol, \u2286 ', which also contains the equality.\n\nIn addition, the following characters are available with the keyboard layout:\nbiological characters ( \u2640 , \u2642 , \u26a5 ), arrows (\u21a6, \u2190), physical constants ( \u0127 )\nand graphic symbols (\u2714, \u2718, \u263a).\n\n## Genesis[edit]\n\nThe initial version 1 was introduced in 2004 by Hanno Behrens on the mailing\nlist of the de ergo keyboard. The name Neo is a recursive acronym and\noriginally stood for NEO Ergonomic Oops , so \"NEO\", later the interpretation\nwas set to Neo ergonomically optimized .\n\nConsidered were experiences of the Dvorak keyboard layout (around 1932), the\nergonomic layout of Helmut Meier (1954) and some later investigations as well\nas attempts to have an ideal occupancy calculated by algorithms alone. Instead\nof treading only a purely mathematical or purely experimental way, as is the\ncase with previous ergonomic layouts, Neo takes both findings into account and\ncombines these with consideration of the ergonomics and the quickly memorable\narrangement of the keys. Thus, Neo relies on the one hand on statistical\nsurveys, in particular the distribution of letters in German and other\nlanguages, and on the other hand on studies on ergonomics by Walter Rohmert,\nthe MARSAN Institute (1979) or Malt (1977).\n\nIn 2005, Neo 1.1 started thinking about how to arrange the keys that are often\nneeded when programming. In it are brackets and special characters on the main\nfield with the help of the key Mod3 , which corresponds to the Qwerty caps\nlock key and the # button and the button Mod4 , which under QWERTY the key Alt\nGr and the key < corresponds to reach.\n\n### Neo 2[edit]\n\nRelease 2, released on March 29, 2010, introduced these changes:\n\n  * In the main level, the keys X, J and Q were swapped cyclically. The X was placed on the left hand so that the frequently used key combinations Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V for the commands \"Cut\", \"Copy\" and \"Paste\" are on one hand. ^[7]\n  * The special character level 3 was completely reworked, as the corresponding shift keys are more accessible.\n  * The higher levels 4-6 were introduced.\n\n## Platforms[edit]\n\nSince late 2006, Neo has been included in Linux as a variant of the German\nkeyboard layout for the X Window System X.Org in all current distributions.\n\nDrivers are downloadable on the project page for common platforms, including\nLinux, Windows, Mac OS, BSD and Solaris. In addition, free learning software\nis available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS. The neo-learning software is an\nofficial part of the KTouch project.\n\nUnder ChromeOS, Neo can be found in the German language settings.\n\nGoogle's Gboard Keyboard for Android supports Neo2.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Neo layout, Neo users group, archived from the original on 2010-09-22\n  2. ^ \"IPA mit Neo\".
