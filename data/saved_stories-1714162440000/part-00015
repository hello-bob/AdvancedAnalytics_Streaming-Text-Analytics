In turn,\nthose drives would infect any new machine they connected to, a capability that\nallowed the malware to spread without requiring any end-user interaction.\nResearchers who have tracked PlugX since at least 2008 have said that the\nmalware has origins in China and has been used by various groups tied to the\ncountry\u2019s Ministry of State Security.\n\n## Still active after all these years\n\nFor reasons that aren\u2019t clear, the worm creator abandoned the one and only IP\naddress that was designated as its command-and-control channel. With no one\ncontrolling the infected machines anymore, the PlugX worm was effectively\ndead, or at least one might have presumed so. The worm, it turns out, has\ncontinued to live on in an undetermined number of machines that possibly\nreaches into the millions, researchers from security firm Sekoia reported.\n\nThe researchers purchased the IP address and connected their own server\ninfrastructure to \u201csinkhole\u201d traffic connecting to it, meaning intercepting\nthe traffic to prevent it from being used maliciously. Since then, their\nserver continues to receive PlugX traffic from 90,000 to 100,000 unique IP\naddresses every day. Over the span of six months, the researchers counted\nrequests from nearly 2.5 million unique IPs. These sorts of requests are\nstandard for virtually all forms of malware and typically happen at regular\nintervals that span from minutes to days. While the number of affected IPs\ndoesn't directly indicate the number of infected machines, the volume\nnonetheless suggests the worm remains active on thousands, possibly millions,\nof devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe initially thought that we will have a few thousand victims connected to\nit, as what we can have on our regular sinkholes,\u201d Sekoia researchers Felix\nAim\u00e9 and Charles M wrote. \u201cHowever, by setting up a simple web server we saw a\ncontinuous flow of HTTP requests varying through the time of the day.\u201d\n\nThey went on to say that other variants of the worm remain active through at\nleast three other command-and-control channels known in security circles.\nThere are indications that one of them may also have been sinkholed, however.\n\nAs the image below shows, the machines reporting to the sinkhole have broad\ngeographic disbursement:\n\nEnlarge / A world map showing country IPs reporting to the sinkhole.\n\nSekoia\n\nA sample of incoming traffic over a single day appeared to show that Nigeria\nhosted the largest concentration of infected machines, followed by India,\nIndonesia, and the UK.\n\nEnlarge / Graph showing the countries with the most affected IPs.\n\nSekoia\n\nThe researchers wrote:\n\n> Based on that data, it\u2019s notable that around 15 countries account for over\n> 80% of the total infections. It\u2019s also intriguing to note that the leading\n> infected countries don\u2019t share many similarities, a pattern observed with\n> previous USB worms such as RETADUP which has the highest infection rates in\n> Spanish spelling countries. This suggests the possibility that this worm\n> might have originated from multiple patient zeros in different countries.\n\nOne explanation is that most of the biggest concentrations are in countries\nthat have coastlines where China\u2019s government has significant investments in\ninfrastructure. Additionally many of the most affected countries have\nstrategic importance to Chinese military objectives. The researchers\nspeculated that the purpose of the campaign was to collect intelligence the\nChinese government could use to achieve those objectives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers noted that the zombie worm has remained susceptible to\ntakeover by any threat actor who gains control of the IP address or manages to\ninsert itself into the pathway between the server at that address and an\ninfected device. That threat poses interesting dilemmas for the governments of\naffected countries. They could choose to preserve the status quo by taking no\naction, or they could activate a self-delete command built into the worm that\nwould disinfect infected machines. Additionally, if they choose the latter\noption, they could elect to disinfect only the infected machine or add new\nfunctionality to disinfect any infected USB drives that happen to be\nconnected.\n\nBecause of how the worm infects drives, disinfecting them risks deleting the\nlegitimate data stored on them. On the other hand, allowing drives to remain\ninfected makes it possible for the worm to start its proliferation all over\nagain. Further complicating the decision-making process, the researchers noted\nthat even if someone issues commands that disinfect any infected drives that\nhappen to be plugged in, it\u2019s inevitable that the worm will live on in drives\nthat aren\u2019t connected when a remote disinfect command is issued.\n\n\u201cGiven the potential legal challenges that could arise from conducting a\nwidespread disinfection campaign, which involves sending an arbitrary command\nto workstations we do not own, we have resolved to defer the decision on\nwhether to disinfect workstations in their respective countries to the\ndiscretion of national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), Law\nEnforcement Agencies (LEAs), and cybersecurity authorities,\u201d the researchers\nwrote. \u201cOnce in possession of the disinfection list, we can provide them an\naccess to start the disinfection for a period of three months. During this\ntime, any PlugX request from an Autonomous System marked for disinfection will\nbe responded to with a removal command or a removal payload.\u201d\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n40\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
