He loves to travel\nand thinks that if libraries were the center of American society, many things\nwould improve overnight. You can hit him up at hilordcastleton@gmail.com.\n\nA few years ago, my oldest child applied to colleges. We did the whole\ncircuit, trying to support him and be the type of informed, helpful parents\nwho made the college application process less stressful rather than more\nstressful.\n\nBut applying to college is difficult, and we quickly had a baptism by fire. As\na parent, you want to set your child up to be in the best possible place for\nthem, but what does that mean?\n\nWe did the dance and helped him paint the most flattering picture of himself,\nand he ended up getting into a few schools.\n\n## Accepted Student Days\n\nThen you have to decide where to go, especially when you don\u2019t get into your\ntop choice(s). That\u2019s when you embark on the trek of something called\n\u201caccepted student days,\u201d where a college or university sets aside a few key\nspring days to close the deal. These are the students they\u2019ve decided meet\nwhatever their criteria is, and now they need to get them to sign on the\ndotted line and pay their deposit.\n\nSo you go around, school to school, and invariably you hear from the president\nof each one. They generally sound the same. For the most part, they all have a\nshrink-wrapped message designed to highlight the finer points of their\nrespective institutions and they\u2019re utterly forgettable.\n\nThis happened over and over to us until we got to Bard College, where we met\npresident Leon Botstein. He\u2019s now approaching his fiftieth \u2013 you read that\nright \u2013 50th year as president of Bard College. When we met him, the guy had\nforgotten more about higher education than most of us ever know and after\nroughly a half century behind the president\u2019s desk, he had no need to impress\nanyone.\n\nHe began with this line:\n\n> \u201cLet me just say a few things to start with. One is that this whole process\n> of getting into college is irrational and dishonest and it\u2019s very hard to\n> play ethically and well in a dishonest system.\u201d\n\nMy jaw dropped and the place erupted with the applause of grateful parents and\nstudents who finally felt they weren\u2019t being lied to or sold a bill of goods.\n\nPresident Botstein went on to talk about the process, answer questions from\nthe crowd, and generally give a lifetime of insight into what is a deeply\nmisguided process. I always direct friends and relatives to this particular\nspeech. It\u2019s unlisted on YouTube, which is a shame because it\u2019s excellent. Of\nthe listed views I\u2019d bet 80% of them are people I sent the link to.\n\nThanks in large part to this speech, my son found the best college for him,\nand it didn\u2019t end up being Bard. I suggest listening to the whole thing, or at\nthe very least, the first few minutes as President Botstein sums up the\napplication process. Below, I\u2019ve pulled out some excerpts that you can hear\nfor yourself in the video or read at your leisure. It really is worth the\ntime.\n\nHere\u2019s the speech, which is chock full of sage advice. Enjoy!\n\n## Bard President Leon Botstein\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Americans are deeply confused about why to go to college and\nwhere to go to college because it\u2019s all about some kind of branding and false\ninformation about the impact of college on work life and incomes and it\nstrangely has very little to do with what the intellectual and academic\nexperience on the ground, and what the impact of going to college is\nultimately after people graduate.\n\n> The good news is that there are many more places people can go to college\n> and get a good education. Ninety percent of what happens to a student in\n> college is from the students\u2019 initiative. So the student has to feel\n> comfortable where they are and they have to feel inspired. And it is as\n> important whom they go to college with as who\u2019s in front of the classroom.\n\nTeaching makes a difference. Teaching makes a difference, and there are many\nplaces with fancy names that are absolutely, catastrophically poor in their\nteaching and don\u2019t pay attention to undergraduates. They\u2019re the low people on\nthe totem pole which starts with postdocs and graduate students and so forth.\nThere are a lot of ridiculous cliches about colleges being \u201cgood at that, not\ngood at other things.\u201d Most American undergraduate programs are pretty\nversatile.\n\nPeople apply to Johns Hopkins because they think they want to go to medical\nschool. It\u2019s completely ignorant. The fact is, Johns Hopkins doesn\u2019t want to\ntake its own undergraduates into medical school. You\u2019re better off going to\nMacAlester College if you want to go to Johns Hopkins for medical school than\ngoing to Johns Hopkins. But Johns Hopkins is a great university and has great\nfaculty and great programs in the social sciences \u2013 all through the sciences \u2013\nand the humanities. But that\u2019s not what it\u2019s known for, so it has a bias in\nits applicant pool to pre-meds. So, if you want to get into Johns Hopkins: say\nyou want to be a Greek and Latin major.\n\n> So every institution has this kind of reputation and those reputations\n> aren\u2019t necessarily accurate.\n\nThe other thing is that the worst part about the admissions process is not\nonly that there is an undue emphasis on where people go to college and not\nenough emphasis on what happens to you in college. There\u2019s misinformation\nabout how important it is to go to a \u201cname brand\u201d place of a certain kind.\nLet\u2019s say the Ivy League is a good example.\n\nAre there advantages? There are probably some advantages but they\u2019re marginal.\nVery marginal, and just going there isn\u2019t good enough. You have to go there\nand excel. And some people have figured out if you excel in a place that\u2019s\nless populated by arrogant, already-conceited achievers, you might actually\nget ahead of the game in the sense that those environments are not necessarily\nthe best for everyone.\n\n> The other thing, of course, is that who gets admitted who doesn\u2019t get\n> admitted, it\u2019s not based on a level playing field and it\u2019s not transparent.\n> And it can\u2019t be transparent and no one should have said it was transparent.\n> People don\u2019t get into places because they deserve to get in.\n\n> Institutions control admissions for their own purposes, not for you.\n\nAnd their purpose is \u2013 some are noble \u2013 so let\u2019s go back to Johns Hopkins or\nBard. We have faculty in every discipline so we could have an entire college\npopulated by students who want to work in the film world. The entire college.\nBut that\u2019s not the faculty [we have]. We\u2019re not a film school. We need\nstudents who are interested in chemistry and biology. We need students who are\ninterested in the social sciences and in economics in Greek and Latin. We have\na very strong Classics program so we\u2019re looking for students to match what we\nhave. We also want students of a certain, very wide range of geographic\nbackground and a kind of cosmopolitan community. Since most people go to\ncollege within 100 miles of their home that is already an ambition. So if you\napply to a very selective institution from Mars, you\u2019d have an undue\nadvantage. So it\u2019s not a level playing field, and the institutions have needs.\n\nWe don\u2019t particularly fall into this category but there are institutions with\nvery heavy sports investments and they need to fill the team \u2013 and all teams \u2013\nand what that has to do with the purposes of universities has never been clear\nto me but it is absolutely necessary for the institution. I think sports is a\nterrific thing, a terrific experience for undergraduates, but it shouldn\u2019t\noverwhelm the fact that America knows more about Duke because of its\nbasketball team. It\u2019s not something to be proud of. Duke is a great university\nthat has a basketball team and that has participated in something that\u2019s\ncalled the \u201cFinal Four\u201d which seems slightly like Sherlock Holmes to me, but\nI\u2019ve never understood what it meant (but I\u2019ve figured it out). I mean that\u2019s\nnice, it\u2019s great, but that\u2019s not what we should be worried about.\n\n> But that affects admissions and of course there are legacies and there\u2019s no\n> way that these legacies can be avoided in institutions because they\u2019re\n> crucial to the financial well-being of the institution.\n>\n> So, for a student to enter this process (and the parent) you have to know\n> that it\u2019s just a lottery whose rules are fixed and whether you got the\n> ticket you wanted or didn\u2019t has nothing to do with you.\n\n## additional Excerpts from the speech:\n\n> No parent should make a young person feel that they somehow goofed.\n\n\u201cIf you had only worked harder in that summer school program you would have\ngotten into school X...\u201d No, no. I assure you, for all of you who have gotten\nrejection letters \u2013 my children got rejection letters too. What that tells\nthem is that there\u2019s somebody just like them and not as good as them that got\nin ahead because the institution had a reason to take them over you. There was\neven a famous institution that has never taken any member of my family out of\na deep-seated animus for which they are not themselves responsible. You follow\nme.\n\n> And so, it\u2019s a terrible experience. An unnecessary experience. You can get a\n> good education anywhere.\n\nWe happen to like this place, those of us who work here and are very admiring\nof the student body and the faculty and of the culture of the institution. And\nwe\u2019re thrilled that people want to come here and we\u2019d like to make sure that\nthe fit is right and students of all types succeed here.\n\nThe final thing I want to say is that this is not as important an event as it\nmight seem. People believe that a good institution is one where a high\npercentage of its students, which is true at Bard, graduate within four or\nfive years of entering college. The important question is not whether they\ngraduate from Bard but whether they graduate from college. Some of our most\nsuccessful interventions with young people are people who, after moderation,\ndecided \u201cyou know, I want to become an interior designer and I want to go to a\ndesign school for an undergraduate design degree\u201d and we help them transfer.\nYou follow me? It\u2019s not a failure. It\u2019s a success.\n\n> Institutions go to great lengths to keep the students because there are\n> these nonsensical ranking systems which are run by second-rate news\n> organizations and they have no idea what they\u2019re doing. And they\u2019re playing\n> a game which has to rescue their failing enterprise but has absolutely\n> nothing to do with higher education.\n\nSomebody once asked you know: what I think of it. I said, \u201cWell, I think\nactually if I were the owners of these ranking organizations I would enter a\nnew business which is ranking churches and develop a set of criteria about how\nchurches should be ranked and I might even have one which is how often god\nappears.\u201d\n\n> Anyway it\u2019s nonsensical. Truly nonsensical, and they don\u2019t have any\n> way...you could possibly measure the intellectual rigor or the helpfulness\n> of the teaching or the impact or the value-added in terms of a student\u2019s\n> growth. We could do that possibly. They don\u2019t.\n\nSo that\u2019s kind of the way they think about higher education. Something that I\njust want to assure you: holding on to the student body till the end is\nconsidered a virtue. They could easily rank by tracking every entering student\nof whether that person graduated after four or five years from some other\nplace. That should be credited to all the institutions.\n\nSo Barack Obama started at Occidental College and finished at Columbia\nUniversity. Is that a demerit for Occidental? No. Something happened to him in\nthe first two years at Occidental which gave him ambition, you know, and he\nrealized he wanted a bigger name-brand to graduate from, and wanted to be not\non the west coast but on the east coast and he transferred to Colombia. I\nthink Occidental should be proud, right? Not the opposite.\n\n> Many institutions are prisoners of their own success. Especially wealthy\n> ones. They\u2019re banks and then they\u2019re educational institutions. What comes\n> first is the preservation of their endowment and their resources and then\n> you know they\u2019ll be happy to provide funds for other things. I\u2019m\n> exaggerating of course but not that much, unfortunately.\n\nSo institutions are very conservative and we saw an opportunity in trying to\nrespond to things that needed doing and those included really integrating the\narts into the world of the university. The making of art, not only the study\nof art. The extension of the liberal arts to populations that are normally\nexcluded, so the Bard High Schools, the Prison Initiative, for example.\n\nBringing the liberal arts in a collaborative way abroad to places. We have the\nlargest Palestinian-American collaboration, academic collaboration. We are\npartners and really guiding partners in the American University in Central\nAsia and Bishkek. We had \u2013 until we were thrown out by Putin for being\n\u201ctreasonous\u201d \u2013 we had for 25 years a fantastic liberal arts college embedded\ninside the University of St. Petersburg and we were the first victims of\nPutin\u2019s quick shift to the right.\n\nSo that was the international sphere. I think the way my attitude has changed\nis that I discovered that you can actually have an impact more than you think\nif you\u2019re willing to take a risk to do it. I was and I am privileged to have\ncolleagues in the institution who believed that was the right thing to do, so\nthe more you had success in doing that, the greater your appetite. We sent a\nnote out yesterday: Jonathan Becker is the vice-president of Academic Affairs\nwho does a lot of these programs. Bard is responsible for two pieces of\nlegislation in New York state. One is the restoration of tap to incarcerate\nthe tuition assistance plan to incarcerated prisoners in the state and the\nothers with the first state to grant the right to vote to residents of\ncampuses with enrollment over 300. We pioneered both of those. Now that\u2019s an\nexample of how an institution can function.\n\nIn the public space, most institutions really don\u2019t care about that and one of\nthe great advantages of the college is that it\u2019s not driven by a kind of\nmythical memory of its own great past, you follow me?\n\n> Most institutions are living in a shadow of a historical monument to\n> themselves which they built.\n\nIt\u2019s a bizarre form of behavior so I think my attitude is that, you know \u2013\nparents do this. I do it as a parent myself so we worry about our children. We\nworry about what\u2019s going to become of them. You know, are they going to be\nable to take care of themselves? Are they going to have to earn a living? Are\nthey going to be happy and all those kinds of things.\n\nI\u2019m an immigrant, so my parents were frightened. This was a strange country\nwith strange ways and they didn\u2019t know anybody. They had no connections so the\nmessage was: you have to excel up to ten times better than the person next you\notherwise you\u2019re gonna be in the street right? And very conservative about\nviews of careers and very conservative about being frightened for their\nchildren. I appreciated that they were frightened for me, you know, at least I\nwas assured they liked me. I wasn\u2019t sure they had a lot of confidence in me,\nbut nonetheless they cared if something happened.\n\nWe often traffic in long-range planning, you know? People will sell you\ninsurance and say: you know you need insurance because the only thing I\u2019m\ncertain about is that yes that I\u2019m mortal, but I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to\nhappen. But people have a belief you can long-range plan and institutions love\nto do this and that\u2019s one thing that I did learn when I came here (I didn\u2019t\nreally think I\u2019d be here as long as I have been and it partly is because\nnobody else would hire me. That\u2019s possible.)\n\nBut no, I really, in all seriousness, I fell in love with the place and the\npossibility but that was renewed. You follow me? I didn\u2019t have a plan, just a\nvague idea. It\u2019s also a function of the institution successfully doing things.\nWe\u2019ve had our failures as well but I don\u2019t think my attitude has changed so\nmuch. The most important thing I do is recruit people and try to hold on to\nthem and prevent other places from poaching.\n\n~~~~~\n\n> \u201cThe most consistent factor in the development of of a successful college\n> career for a student and most of us who\u2019ve had successful college\n> experiences ourselves can confirm this is developing a supportive\n> relationship with an adult who\u2019s not a member of your family whom you\n> respect who has shown confidence in you for professional reasons because of\n> your talent because of your interest and that\u2019s a very important dynamic.\n\nIt was a transformative dynamic for me and I\u2019m sure of all the faculty that we\nall remember. There is a moment in college whether it\u2019s in a chemistry lab or\nwhether it\u2019s in an English class or in a rehearsal room, that an adult \u2013 now\nyou have to understand all of you parents, right? We all know that most of the\npopulation doesn\u2019t like adolescents. Nobody goes to bed with a partner and\nsays \u201choney let\u2019s have an adolescent.\u201d They say \u201clet\u2019s have a baby.\u201d\n\n> The gift of teaching is partly to give confidence and self-confidence to\n> people who are at the brink of adulthood or in the early stages of adulthood\n> and that is the key ingredient of a successful college career. It\u2019s a boost\n> in the self-confidence and ambition that a young person can have and it has\n> to be given by teachers and faculty whom the young people admire.\n\n\u201cWe have a country which is deeply, deeply polarized in which the desire or\ncapacity to communicate across belief lines is very, very, very weak. What we\nstand for is to think for yourself and to learn to use language and therefore\nthoughts that you own and create and believe in. And to resist conformity and\nto listen to the other person and not to rush to judgment. Even if you rush to\njudgment, not to rush to vengeance, retribution, and moral condemnation.\n\n> Good people can be wrong and bad people can be right. On political issues\n> this agreement doesn\u2019t necessarily mean moral or ethical inferiority.\n\nDo we do a good job of it? Probably not, but better than the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so obvious but [once upon a time] people often went to colleges to\nchallenge their beliefs. You know, they were church-going teenagers and\nthey\u2019re part of youth group and they went to a philosophy class in which the\nphilosopher showed the enormous weight of arguments against the existence of\ngod and the irrationality of religious belief and the idea was that if you\ncannot \u2013 and certainly Jesus believed this \u2013 that you need to overcome the\nchallenge of doubt.\n\nYou don\u2019t sustain the faith in god by hiding the truth or the difficulties of\nlife or the paradoxes. That\u2019s the meaning of the Book of Job, right? So that\nwas going to college. Today, it\u2019s a little different. People seem to want to\ngo to a place where their prejudices are already confirmed, but they won\u2019t\ntolerate something being said that challenges a set of sacred beliefs. We try\nto fight against that. We try to fight against the idea that if you really\nbelieve in something you have to understand why people don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have\nto justify, but you have to understand it.\u201d\n\n> We must live in a pluralist world. We must live in a world where we seem\n> different, look different, think differently, and we need to embrace that\n> difference without resorting to violence. That\u2019s the business we\u2019re in.\n\nI grew up wanting to understand as best one could the nature of the modern\npredicament. The modern predicament, as I saw it from the perspective of\ngrowing up in the generation I did, was the conflict between progress and\nscience and technology and the increasing barbarism and violence that was to\nmy generation evidenced by the bombing of Hiroshima and the concentration\ncamps.\n\n> How could civilized, so-called progressive modern [people] that had modern\n> medicine, technology, science \u2013 why there was no parallel progress in\n> ethical and political life? And there was, in fact, a modernization and\n> bureaucratization of violence at a scale that was unknown so that\u2019s the\n> paradox.\u201d\n\n  * How can we bring the country together to extend freedom and justice without retribution?\n  * How can we go down the path that was once visible in the work of Nelson Mandela?\n  * How can we confront our own history and injustices with a mixture of progress and forgiveness?\n  * How can we actually seek to feel pleasure at retribution?\n  * Why do we have the large number of incarcerated people?\n  * Why do we deal with failure the way we do?\n  * Why do we tolerate the incredible inequality of wealth in a country?\n  * How is it possible that a single individual should be richer than a sovereign nation? That can\u2019t be right. It can\u2019t be right, smart as Jeff Bezos is, it\u2019s not right, and why is our government so ineffective?\n  * Why do generations of republicans and democrats let the industrial transformation of America result in the evisceration, destruction of millions of lives in the rust belt of America?\n  * Whose bidding were they doing?\n\nSo we all share some responsibilities, so as an undergraduate I would be\ninterested in those questions whether I studied economics or history. The\nother thing is that I\u2019m a musician and I love music because it is utterly\nhuman and totally useless but I mean that seriously: its uselessness is its\npower.\n\nIt\u2019s not about what it can do, but for me it\u2019s a matter of life and death. If\nI were unable to make music as the center of my life, I would lose my will to\nlive.\n\n> You can\u2019t make a mistake. I want to tell the parents: don\u2019t be too nervous,\n> and show interest. The one thing people sometimes mistake is that, don\u2019t\n> overdo the interest, but don\u2019t undercook it either. They miss you as much as\n> you miss them, even though they don\u2019t act that way.\n\nThor Benander Author\n\nThor Benander is the Editor-in-Chief of The Antagonist and a father of four.\nHe\u2019s a lover of ancient history, Greek food, and sports.
