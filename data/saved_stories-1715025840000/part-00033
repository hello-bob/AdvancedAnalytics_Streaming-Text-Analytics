We only use them once we find an available booking, and only to secure a\nbooking for you. We can't access sensitive payment information on Resy (even\nif we wanted to).\n\n#### Do you guarantee a reservation?\n\nWe don't guarantee reservations because sometimes they never become available.\nWe do however take pride in having a high success rate at getting you the\nreservation you are looking for!\n\n#### Can I cancel a reservation once its booked?\n\nIf the restaurant allows cancellations, sure! You can cancel by logging into\nResy. Be sure to check the restaurant's cancellation policy on Resy before\ncancelling to avoid fees.\n\n#### Restaurant X is not supported yet. Can you add it?\n\nEmail us at hello@autores.io with your request. We are constantly adding\nrestaurants and are open to adding more spots as long as they are in high\ndemand :).\n\n#### I tried to sign up but can't, why?\n\nWe may place you on a waitlist if we have too many active users to prevent\nusers from competing for reservations. We will most likely grant you access\nwithin a 1-2 weeks.\n\n#### Are others on AutoRes are looking for the same time slot?\n\nThey could be, but AutoRes shows you how many users are looking at each time\nslot, so pick one that's less competitive to have the highest chance of\nsnagging the reservation.\n\n#### Why are some time slots not shown for a specific restaurant?\n\nSome of the more exclusive restaurants only release reservations for specific\ntimes, and keep prime time tables for recurring guests. We only show you time\nslots that we know we can book.\n\n#### Can I unlink my Resy account once I've added it?\n\nYes! Currently you can email us at support@autores.io to unlink your account.\nWe'll be adding functionality to allow you to do this on your own shortly.\n\n### App Integrations\n\nStart your free account and upgrade anytime.\n\nSee all Integration\n\n\u201cI recommend software to everyone who interested in running a online business\u201d\n\nMichael G.
