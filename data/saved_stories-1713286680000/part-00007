Amongst the proposals was the revised CO2 Act,\nwhich set out Switzerland\u2019s climate policy and the measures the Alpine nation\nwould adopt to maintain its emission reduction targets as instructed by the\nParis Agreement. New measures included, inter alia, a tax on air travel and a\ncar fuel levy, alongside greater investment in green technology such as\nelectric vehicle charging stations. By a margin of 52 to 48 percent (yes, that\nagain!), the Swiss electorate rejected the proposal, and the government duly\nwent back to the drawing board. Another successful execution of Switzerland\u2019s\nunique system of popular initiatives \u2014 vox populi, vox Dei.\n\nThen, last week, a verdict was reached at the European Court of Human Rights\nafter four Swiss individuals and a Swiss association representing older women\nbrought a claim against their government, arguing that the Swiss authorities\nhad violated their human rights by failing to take sufficient action to\nmitigate the effects of climate change. The Court ruled in their favour on\naccount of Article 8 \u2014 the right to respect for private and family life \u2014\nwhich was interpreted as encompassing \u201ca right to effective protection by the\nState authorities from the serious adverse effects of climate change on lives,\nhealth, well-being and quality of life\u201d.\n\n> In essence, the Court ruled that by following through on the referendum\n> result ... the Swiss state had violated its own population\u2019s human rights\n\nThe Court acknowledged that Switzerland\u2019s climate strategy had been disrupted\nby the people rejecting the CO2 Act in the 2021 referendum and stated that a\n\u201clegislative lacuna\u201d had followed. A revised Act, which was confirmed in a\nreferendum in June 2023, sets out \u201cgeneral objectives and targets but [not]\nthe concrete measures to achieve those targets\u201d. The Court concluded that in\nfailing to devise, develop, and implement a relevant legislative and\nadministrative framework, the Swiss authorities were not meeting the \u201cpositive\nobligations derived from Article 8\u201d, and were therefore in violation of the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights. In essence, the Court ruled that by\nfollowing through on the referendum result and dumping the CO2 Act\u2019s measures,\nthe Swiss state had violated its own population\u2019s human rights.\n\nProminent British lawyer Jessica Simor KC, who represented the applicants,\nshared her delight following the verdict in a TV interview. She argued that\nSwitzerland is \u201cparticularly problematic because they have referendums\u201d, which\npose an issue in relation to human rights due to \u201cthe conflict between this\nidea of democracy as just what the people choose, and democracy as entailing\nsome fundamental and universal rights\u201d. Simor is unambiguous on what side of\nthe conflict she supports, adding: \u201cdemocracy is not merely rule of the\nmajority; it is also rule of the majority subject to some fundamental norms\u201d.\n\nThe description of democracy given by Simor is by no means novel; the conflict\nbetween the majority will and the protection of minority rights and civil\nliberties has been a feature of liberal democracy since inception. It is not\nconstitutionally unprecedented to have tension between judicial decisions and\ndemocratic verdicts. In legalese, it is known as the counter-majoritarian\ndifficulty \u2014 the conflict that arises when judicial review contradicts an\nexpressed majority will. But under the surface of Simor\u2019s innocuous\npronunciations on the importance of \u201cfundamental norms\u201d is a pernicious\npolitical tendency that aims to stop issues from being legitimately contested\nin a democracy, thereby disempowering electorates.\n\nSpearheaded by a cadre of well-known lawyers and their supporters, this\ntendency seeks to use the courts, rather than electoral politics, as the\nvehicle for delivering social change. In a technique dubbed lawfare, groups\nsuch as the Good Law Project use litigation as a \u201ctool for positive change\u201d.\nSome issues are so complex and important that only the expert class, which\nthey conveniently hold themselves to be a part of, should decide on them. It\nengages in a form of post-politics that posits there to be objectively correct\ncourses of action, as dictated by the experts, where opposition is motivated\nby ignorance and emotion. Contentious political issues are reduced to\ntechnical matters; \u201cHow can you reasonably be opposed to a car fuel levy when\nthe experts have concluded that it is good?\u201d.\n\nThis worldview was directly attacked in Michael Gove\u2019s infamous quip that \u201cthe\npeople in this country have had enough of experts from organisations with\nacronyms saying that they know what is best\u201d. Rather than heed the resonance\nof Gove\u2019s statement as a sign that the balance between the expert class and\npublic sentiment had been knocked out of kilter, the statement was mocked and\nvilified as an example of the pernicious threat the public could be to good\ngovernance. The subsequent victory of Gove\u2019s Vote Leave campaign was not met\nwith humility and introspection, but a doubling down on rule by the experts.\n\nFor Simor and her ilk, the lesson of Brexit was that the public were\nirredeemably prejudiced, ignorant, and above all, dangerous. Susceptible to\nmisinformation as they were (remember the red bus?), the public could not be\ntrusted to make such deeply consequential decisions, so attempting to persuade\nthe peons of the righteousness of a given cause was a waste of time. Simor\nherself then took part in a concerted campaign to frustrate and thwart Brexit\nthrough the courts. In one such judicial appeal, the presiding Lord Justice\nHickinbottom noted that the applicants \u201cclearly oppose the UK leaving the EU\u201d,\nadding that \u201cthe debate which the claimant seeks to promote belongs firmly in\nthe political arena, not the courts\u201d, He reiterated that \u201c[j]udicial review is\nnot, and should not be regarded as, politics by another means\u201d.\n\nSimor took no notice. In her view, \u201cthere is no bright line between politics\nand law\u201d and \u201c[judicial powers] are necessarily political because their proper\napplication ensures the maintenance of freedom that forms the bedrock of a\ntrue democracy\u201d.\n\nWith Brexit now largely a closed chapter, climate change is the latest cause\nc\u00e9l\u00e8bre to be taken from a democratically contested issue and elevated to a\ntechnical issue to be dealt with by experts. By its nature, climate change\nseems like the ideal problem to be solved through scientific objectivity and\npolitical neutrality, above the corruption, prejudices, and ignorance of\ndemocratic politics.\n\nYet even if we assume that the scientists are correct in their prognosis, that\ntheir models of various future climate scenarios are accurate, it does not\nfollow that there is only one scientific and apolitical course of action to be\ntaken. Like any issue which encompasses so many aspects of life, there exist\nvarious legitimate competing interests that dictate what policies ought to be\nimplemented. One might conclude that European states must reach emission\nneutrality within a few decades regardless of the high financial cost, or\nequally that the relatively minor contribution of European states to global\nemissions (the EU27 are responsible for 6.7 percent of global emissions, and\nSwitzerland just 0.1 percent) means that trying to retard climate change is\nfutile, with money being more effectively spent on mitigation measures.\nElderly Swiss women may be better served if their government rolled out a\nprogram of free air conditioning units rather than disincentivising air\ntravel, for example.\n\n> ... what is democracy now except a government of, by, and for old Swiss\n> women?\n\nWhile the Swiss allowed their electorate to weigh up the pros and cons of any\nclimate measures and conclude by democratic agreement, this latest ECHR\nruling, based on a spurious reading of Article 8, means that it will now be\nthe exclusive domain of the expert class, where the electorate have no\ndemocratic recourse to change path. Simor celebrated this as a victory for\ndemocracy and entrenchment of a fundamental and universal right, but what is\ndemocracy now except a government of, by, and for old Swiss women?\n\nShare\n\n## Enjoying The Critic online?
