It is\nunlikely that any other species, including our close genetic cousins the\nNeanderthals, ever had language, and so-called sign \u2018language\u2019 in Great Apes\nis nothing like human language. Language evolution shares many features with\nbiological evolution, and this has made it useful for tracing recent human\nhistory and for studying how culture evolves among groups of people with\nrelated languages. A case can be made that language has played a more\nimportant role in our species\u2019 recent (circa last 200,000 years) evolution\nthan have our genes.\n\n## What is special about human language?\n\nHuman language is distinct from all other known animal forms of communication\nin being compositional. Human language allows speakers to express thoughts in\nsentences comprising subjects, verbs and objects\u2014such as \u2018I kicked the\nball\u2019\u2014and recognizing past, present and future tenses. Compositionality gives\nhuman language an endless capacity for generating new sentences as speakers\ncombine and recombine sets of words into their subject, verb and object roles.\nFor instance, with just 25 different words for each role, it is already\npossible to generate over 15,000 distinct sentences. Human language is also\nreferential, meaning speakers use it to exchange specific information with\neach other about people or objects and their locations or actions.\n\n## What is animal \u2018language\u2019 like?\n\nAnimal \u2018language\u2019 is nothing like human language. Among primates, vervet\nmonkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) produce three distinct alarm calls in\nresponse to the presence of snakes, leopards and eagles [1]. A number of\nparrot species can mimic human sounds, and some Great Apes have been taught to\nmake sign language gestures with their hands. Some dolphin species seem to\nhave a variety of repetitive sound motifs (clicks) associated with hunting or\nsocial grouping. These forms of animal communication are symbolic in the sense\nof using a sound to stand in for an object or action, but there is no evidence\nfor compositionality, or that they are truly generative and creative forms of\ncommunication in which speakers and listeners exchange information [2].\n\nInstead non-human animal communication is principally limited to repetitive\ninstrumental acts directed towards a specific end, lacking any formal\ngrammatical structure, and often explainable in terms of hard-wired evolved\nbehaviours or simple associative learning [2]. Most ape sign language, for\nexample, is concerned with requests for food. The trained chimpanzee Nim\nChimpsky\u2019s longest recorded \u2018utterance\u2019, when translated from sign language,\nwas \u2018give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me\nyou\u2019 [3]. Alarm calls such as observed in the vervet monkeys often evolve by\nkin-selection to protect one\u2019s relatives, or even selfishly to distract\npredators away from the caller. Hunting and social group communications can be\nexplained as learned coordinating signals without \u2018speakers\u2019 knowing why they\nare acting as they are.\n\n## When did human language evolve?\n\nNo one knows for sure when language evolved, but fossil and genetic data\nsuggest that humanity can probably trace its ancestry back to populations of\nanatomically modern Homo sapiens (people who would have looked like you and\nme) who lived around 150,000 to 200,000 years ago in eastern or perhaps\nsouthern Africa [4,5,6]. Because all human groups have language, language\nitself, or at least the capacity for it, is probably at least 150,000 to\n200,000 years old. This conclusion is backed up by evidence of abstract and\nsymbolic behaviour in these early modern humans, taking the form of engravings\non red-ochre [7, 8].\n\nThe archaeological record reveals that about 40,000 years ago there was a\nflowering of art and other cultural artefacts at modern human sites, leading\nsome archaeologists to suggest that a late genetic change in our lineage gave\nrise to language at this later time [9]. But this evidence derives mainly from\nEuropean sites and so struggles to explain how the newly evolved language\ncapacity found its way into the rest of humanity who had dispersed from Africa\nto other parts of the globe by around 70,000 years ago.\n\n## Could language be older than our species?\n\nAncient DNA reveals us to be over 99% identical in the sequences of our\nprotein coding genes to our sister species the Neanderthals (Homo\nneanderthalensis) [10]. The Neanderthals had large brains and were able to\ninhabit much of Eurasia from around 350,000 years ago. If the Neanderthals had\nlanguage, that would place its origin at least as far back as the time of our\ncommon ancestor with them, currently thought to be around 550,000 to 750,000\nyears ago [10, 11].\n\nHowever, even as recently as 40,000 years ago in Europe, the Neanderthals show\nalmost no evidence of the symbolic thinking\u2014no art or sculpture for\nexample\u2014that we often associate with language, and little evidence of the\ncultural attainments of Homo sapiens of the same era. By 40,000 years ago,\nHomo sapiens had plentiful art, musical instruments and specialized tools such\nas sewing needles. Neanderthals probably didn\u2019t even have sewn clothing,\ninstead they would have merely draped themselves with skins [12]. And, despite\nevidence that around 1\u20135% of the human genome might be derived from\nhuman\u2013Neanderthal matings [13], the Neanderthals went extinct as a species\nwhile we flourished.\n\n## Can genetic evidence help to decide when language evolved?\n\nYes. Modern humans and Neanderthals share a derived version of a transcription\nfactor gene known as FOXP2 that differs from the chimpanzee version by two\namino acid replacements [14]. FOXP2 influences the fine-motor control of\nfacial muscles required for the production of speech. Indeed, inserting this\nderived form into mice causes them to squeak differently [15]! However, in\nspite of having identical primary sequences to Neanderthals, modern humans\nhave acquired changes to the regulation of their FOXP2 genes that seem likely\nto cause their FOXP2 to be expressed differently to that of the Neanderthals\n[16], and these expression differences are pronounced in brain neurons.\nCombining these genetic hints with the differences in symbolic and cultural\nbehaviour that are evident from the fossil record suggests language arose in\nour lineage sometime after our split from our common ancestor with\nNeanderthals, and probably by no later than 150,000 to 200,000 years ago.\n\n## Was there a single origin of language?\n\nThis question has parallels in biological evolution. Did life evolve once or\nmany times? The presence of the same RNA and DNA in all organisms and\nhomologies in the machinery of DNA transcription and translation suggest that\nat least all current life on Earth has a common origin. It is possible that\nlife evolved more than once but all descendants of these other origins went\nextinct and left no fossil or other traces.\n\nWith language the inference is harder to make because features such as\nvocabulary and grammar change too rapidly to be able to link all of the\nworld\u2019s languages to a common original mother tongue. On the other hand, all\nhuman languages rely on combining sounds or \u2018phones\u2019 to make words, many of\nthose sounds are common across languages, different languages seem to\nstructure the world semantically in similar ways [17], all human languages\nrecognize the past, present and future and all human languages structure words\ninto sentences [18]. All humans are also capable of learning and speaking each\nother\u2019s languages (some phones are unique to some language families\u2014such as\nthe famous \u2018click\u2019 sound of some San languages of Southern Africa\u2014but these\nare probably within the capability of all human speakers if they are exposed\nto learning that sound at the right time of life).\n\nThese considerations suggest that the anatomical, neurological and\nphysiological underpinnings of language are shared among all of humanity. If\nthe capacity for language did evolve more than once, all traces of it seem to\nhave been lost. This conclusion is buttressed by the FOXP2 evidence (all\nhumans share the same derived gene) and by the fact that genetic data point to\nall modern humans descending from a common ancestor [19].\n\n## Is language evolution like biological evolution?\n\nDarwin observed that \u201cThe formation of different languages and of distinct\nspecies, and the proofs that both have been developed through a gradual\nprocess, are curiously the same\u201d (page 59 in [20]). He also asserted that \u201cThe\nsurvival and preservation of certain favoured words in the struggle for\nexistence is natural selection.\u201d (pages 59\u201360 in [20]).\n\nDarwin was right on both counts. Linguists have known from at least the late\n18th century [21]\u2014about 100 years before Darwin\u2014that languages predominantly\nevolve by a process of descent with modification from earlier ancestral\nlanguages, just as biological species descend from earlier ancestral forms. An\nexample is differences observed between the ancient Greek vocabulary in\nHomer\u2019s Iliad from around 750 BCE and modern Greek vocabulary (Table 1) [22]:\nsome words have merely changed their pronunciation while others have been\nreplaced by new unrelated words.\n\nTable 1 Linguistic descent with modification spanning nearly three millennia^a\n\nFull size table\n\nRegarding Darwin\u2019s assertions that certain words are favoured in the \u2018struggle\nfor existence\u2019, it is useful to remember that there is seldom any connection\nbetween a sound (a word) and its meaning. This means that selection is\nreasonably free to choose among words and so features of the words we actually\nuse might reveal its actions. The simplest example is that words that are used\nmore often\u2014such as I, he, she, it, the, you\u2014tend to be shorter, and\nconsequently easier to pronounce, than less frequently used words, such as\nobstreperous or catafalque [23]. This is an example of a form of natural\nselection except here instead of biological individuals competing in the\nphysical environment to survive and reproduce, words compete for space in the\nenvironment of the human mind. Our minds give preference to shorter versions\nof the frequently used words, presumably to reduce effort [23]. This pressure\nis relaxed among the less frequently used words, allowing them to be longer.\nIt might also be the case that once the frequently used words have occupied\nthe space of possible short words, there are fewer opportunities for the less\nfrequently used words [24].\n\n## Is it possible to reconstruct the history of a group of languages like we\ndo with species?\n\nYes. Using common lists of words that are found in all or nearly all\nlanguages, linguists can identify shared sets of cognate words\u2014words that\ndescend from common ancestral words\u2014 just as it is possible to identify\nhomologous genes that share a common ancestral gene. For instance the Spanish\nmano (\u2018hand\u2019) and the French main descend from the earlier Latin manus, while\nthe English and German words hand do not. A cognate set identifies groups of\nrelated languages. In the example here mano and main identify the so-called\nRomance languages (Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese) and hand and hand\nidentify the Germanic languages (Fig. 1). By combining the information in many\ndifferent cognate sets with appropriate statistical models [25, 26], it is\npossible to infer detailed family histories or phylogenetic trees of language\nfamilies, such as has been done for the Indo-European languages (Fig. 1).\nThese phylogenies are directly analogous to phylogenies of biological species.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nPhylogenetic tree of a small subset of the approximately 400 or so Indo-\nEuropean languages. Words that the languages use for the meaning \u2018hand\u2019 are\ncolour-coded to identify cognate classes. Rectangles along the branches\nidentify regions of the tree where new cognate classes might have arisen. Here\nthe French and Spanish languages share cognate forms for \u2018hand\u2019 derived from\nan earlier Latin form \u2018manus\u2019. French and Spanish are part of the familiar\ngrouping of Romance languages. By comparison, the word \u2018hand\u2019 is cognate\nbetween English and German and this cognate class identifies part of the\nGermanic grouping of languages. The words for \u2018hand\u2019 in Greek and in the\nextinct Anatolian languages Hittite and Tocharian form two additional cognate\nsets. Combining many different cognate sets from many different vocabulary\nitems allows investigators to draw detailed phylogenetic trees of entire\nlanguage families (see text)\n\nFull size image\n\n## What other evolutionary features do genes and language share?\n\nLinguistic and biological evolution share features beyond descent with\nmodification and selection, including mechanisms of mutation and replication,\nspeciation, drift and horizontal transfer (Table 2). At a deeper level, both\ngenes and languages can be represented as digital systems of inheritance,\nbuilt on the transmission of discrete chunks of information\u2014genes in the case\nof biological organisms, and words in the case of language. Genes in turn\ncomprise combinations of the four bases or nucleotides (A, C, G, T) while\nwords can be modelled as comprising combinations of discrete sounds or phones\n(in fact, phones or sounds vary in a continuous space but languages are\ncommonly represented as expressing a particular set of discrete phonemes).\n\nTable 2 Some parallels between biological and linguistic evolution\n\nFull size table\n\nThese similarities mean that we can\u2014and should\u2014think of language as a system\nfor the transmission of information that is tantamount to \u2018aural DNA\u2019. Even\nthe peculiar phenomenon of concerted evolution in genetics\u2014where a nucleotide\nreplacement at a specific site in one gene is quickly followed by the same\nnucleotide replacement at the same site in other, typically related, genes\u2014is\nalso observed in language. Known as regular sound change, a specific phone or\nsound changes over a relatively short period of time to the same other phone\nin many words in the lexicon [27, 28]. A well-known example is the p \u2192 f sound\nchange in the Germanic languages where an older Indo-European p sound was\nreplaced by an f sound, such as in pater \u2192 father; or pes, pedis \u2192 foot.\n\n## Can changes to language be used to trace human history?\n\nThere are currently about 7000 languages spoken around the world, meaning\nthat, oddly, most of us cannot communicate with most other members of our\nspecies! Even this number is probably down from the peak of human linguistic\ndiversity that was likely to have occurred around 10,000 years ago, just prior\nto the invention of agriculture [29]. Before that time, all human groups had\nbeen hunter-gatherers, living in small mobile tribal societies. Farming\nsocieties were demographically more prosperous and group sizes were larger\nthan among hunter-gatherers, so the expansion of agriculturalists likely\nreplaced many smaller linguistic groups. Today, there are few hunter-gatherer\nsocieties left so our linguistic diversity reflects our relatively recent\nagricultural past.\n\nPhylogenies of languages can be used in combination with geographical\ninformation or information on cultural practices to investigate questions of\nhuman history, such as the spread of agriculture. Phylogenies of language\nfamilies have been used to study the timing, causes and geographic spread of\ngroups of farmers/fishing populations, including the Indo-Europeans\n[30,31,32,33]; the pace of occupation of the Pacific by the Austronesian\npeople [34]; and the migration routes of the Bantu-speaking people through\nAfrica [35, 36].\n\nLinguistic phylogenies are also used to investigate questions of human\ncultural evolution, including the evolution and spread of dairying [37,38,39],\nrelationships between religious and political practices [40], changing\npolitical structures [41] and the age of fairy tales [42], and have even\nsupplied a date for Homer\u2019s Iliad [22].\n\n## What role has language played in our species\u2019 success?\n\nLanguage has played a prominent and possibly pre-eminent role in our species\u2019\nhistory. Consider that where all other species tend to be found in the\nenvironments their genes adapt them to, humans can adapt at the cultural\nlevel, acquiring the knowledge and producing the tools, shelters, clothing and\nother artefacts necessary for survival in diverse habitats [12, 43]. Thus,\nchimpanzees are found in the dense forests of Africa but not out on the\nsavannah or in deserts or cold regions; camels are found in dry regions but\nnot in forests or mountaintops, and so on for other species. Humans, on the\nother hand, despite being a species that probably evolved on the African\nsavannahs, have been able to occupy nearly every habitat on Earth. Our\nbehaviour is like that of a collection of biological species [43]. Why this\nstriking difference?\n\nIt is probably down to language. Possessing language, humans have had a high-\nfidelity code for transmitting detailed information down the generations.\nMany, if not most, of the things we make use of in our everyday lives rely on\nspecialized knowledge or skills to produce. The information behind these was\nhistorically coded in verbal instructions, and with the advent of writing it\ncould be stored and become increasingly complex.\n\nPossessing language, then, is behind humans\u2019 ability to produce sophisticated\ncultural adaptations that have accumulated one on top of the other throughout\nour history as a species. Today as a result of this capability we live in a\nworld full of technologies that few of us even understand. Because culture,\nriding on the back of language, can evolve more rapidly than genes, the\nrelative genetic homogeneity of humanity in contrast to our cultural diversity\nshows that our \u2018aural DNA\u2019 has probably been more important in our short\nhistory than genes.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
