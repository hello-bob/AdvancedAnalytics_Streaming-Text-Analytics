Persuasiveness? It\u2019s no longer a distraction,\nit\u2019s an addiction, it\u2019s everywhere, and its aggressive promotion and passive\nacceptance is driving me crazy.\n\nI\u2019m walking around on campus where students don\u2019t look up while walking but\ndown\u2014desperately trying to catch every single glimpse of their backlit screen.\nIts usage in and around classrooms is detrimental to their learning.\n\nI\u2019m trying to order dinner at a restaurant but can\u2019t find the menu unless I\nscan a QR code while I purposely left my phone at home to enable social\ninteraction, not massive distraction.\n\nI receive emails written in smartphone-mode where not only questions are\nbarely understandable thanks to hip abbreviations but punctuation and correct\naddressing guidelines seemed to never have existed. Sent from iPhone. Please\nexcuse typos and brevity.\n\nI browse through paper ads\u2014you know, the ones dumped in your real mailbox\u2014and\nagain have to pull out my phone because leaflets are too lazy to put in\nopening hours or details and instead simply print QR codes with redirect links\nthat have a 99% chance of fingerprinting.\n\nI put on a local soap show and literally have to watch people typing away on\ntheir smartphone while an overlay interface for the viewer sees their texts.\nThen, during a break, I have to watch ads for faster and always-on internet\nand 5G mobile networks, because, 100% connectivity is what we all want. Bed\nsheet ads end with a woman in bed seemingly happily scrolling away to promote\ntheir always-open webshop. Food ordering services want you to install their\napp because their users have clearly become happier, snappier, and can manage\nmore in life.\n\nI want to take the bus to the station but don\u2019t know their schedule. App,\nright? Or QR code? Why not both, as long as we make sure that the printed\ninformation on the bus stops is out of date so that people who actually use\nthat service are confused.\n\nI walk around in a store but people keep on bumping into me, mumbling sorry!\nbecause they prefer watching YouTube videos and scrolling through Yet Another\nSocial Media Feed instead of just being present and trying to avoid collision\nwith others.\n\nI bike to work and have to listen to school kids\u2019 boom boxes a.k.a. their\nsmartphones. That\u2019s not so bad (depending on the music), right? What about\ntexting and biking next to the local canal? Or what about scrolling and speedy\ne-biking?\n\nI talk to colleagues at the water cooler but halfway the conversation the\ncolleague keeps on looking at the time giving me the impression that I\u2019m\nboring them. Of course that watch is a smart watch and that incoming event is\nmore important than actually talking to people. You were saying? Never mind. I\ncan\u2019t count the number of conversations I\u2019ve had with distracted people thanks\nto their \u201csmart\u201d things.\n\nI try to facilitate a meeting and see people alternating between trying very\nhard to focus and pay attention, and the next minute digging up their\nsmartphone from their pockets and scrolling. When I ask them a question, they\nmight put it aside for a moment, but the answer is never a qualitative one.\n\nI wonder out loud what kind of weather it would be tomorrow, or who that actor\nof that film we\u2019re watching worked with before. Before I know it, someone has\nlooked up the answer and proudly presented me the result. My wondering wasn\u2019t\nlooking for answers but just wondering, but clearly, the instant Let Me Google\nThat For You feedback system is more important.\n\nI walk the dog and cross other dogs\u2014happily sniffling and looking around\u2014and\ntheir owners\u2014depressingly scrolling on their phones because of course you\ncan\u2019t leave that device unattended at home for fifteen minutes.\n\nI take the stairs connecting the garage and the office spaces at work and\ncross people with their hands completely fused with their phones, refusing to\nlet go in order to more easily open the door. A few minutes later, I cross\nthem again at the coffee machine, still clutching onto their oversized gadget\nlike Tolkien\u2019s Gollum and his precious.\n\nI propose to go to a new restaurant and want to let the menu surprise me but\nfind my companions partially ruining the fun by immediately retrieving the\nmenu online thanks to their super-connected phone and ridiculous data usage\nsubscriptions.\n\nI want to read a book and see my wife scrolling on her phone without paying\nattention to the TV, who, as soon as I reach for the remote to turn it off and\nhave a bit of head space, starts complaining that she really was watching that\nshow.\n\nI stop at a red light on the way to the supermarket and notice other drivers\nnext to me automatically reaching for their phones because they have two\nseconds to spare that apparently absolutely need to be spend on more\ndistraction/addiction feeding.\n\nI want to sell toys our daughter no longer plays with on an online second hand\nmarket platform but regularly fail to close the deal because others expect me\nto answer within 2 minutes while I check the platform once or twice a day,\npreferably without using the app.\n\nI hate this digital world we\u2019re suddenly living in.\n\n### You Might Also Like...\n\n  * Email Etiquette 12 Jan 2024\n  * ChatGPT Is Worse For Students Than Stack Overflow 05 Oct 2023\n  * The Modern QR Code Life 13 Jun 2022\n  * An Ad Leaflet QR Design Mistake 10 Mar 2022\n\n### Bio and Support\n\nI'm Wouter Groeneveld, a Brain Baker, and I love the smell of freshly baked\nthoughts (and bread) in the morning.
