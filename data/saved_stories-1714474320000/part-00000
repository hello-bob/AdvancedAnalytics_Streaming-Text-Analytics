Then silence. Our\nnew friend will usually go on to say they either hated or did terribly in\nchemistry at school.\n\nOr, depending on what\u2019s been in the news lately, they might start talking\nabout parabens in shampoo, or BPA in plastic poisoning our dogs, or the\n\u201cforever chemicals\u201d PFAS in everything.\n\nChemistry, it must be admitted, has an image problem.\n\n## Chemistry\u2019s image problem\n\nBy the age of six, many children already have negative feelings about the word\n\u201cchemical\u201d.\n\nAsk the average person what a chemical is, and they\u2019re likely to tell you it\u2019s\nsomething bad. Products advertise themselves as \u201cchemical-free\u201d \u2013 an assertion\nthat makes no scientific sense (since everything in the world is made of\nchemicals) but resonates with the consumer.\n\nThe media often doesn\u2019t help chemistry\u2019s image. Positive news stories about\nscience are often about a breakthrough cure for some disease, years before it\nmight eventually be approved for use in patients, or the latest nifty-looking\nthing we\u2019ve noticed up in space.\n\nStories about chemistry, on the other hand, are often negative: toxic chemical\nspill from train derailment; ammonia leak sparks evacuation; residents told to\nstay inside as warehouse fire spreads toxic smoke.\n\n## The modern world is built on chemistry\n\nHowever, everyone in the world owes much of their present standard of living\nto advances made by chemists. Without the Haber-Bosch process for creating\nfertiliser from nitrogen in the air, half the world\u2019s population would not\nhave enough to eat. All modern medicines, from aspirin to RNA vaccines, owe\ntheir discovery to chemistry.\n\nThe lithium batteries that enable so many portable electronic devices \u2013 yep,\nchemistry. We could go on.\n\nAnd indeed we will.\n\nThe chemical fertiliser that lets modern agriculture grow enough food to feed\nthe world? That\u2019s chemistry.

The\nsynthesis of lightweight plastics, polymers and composites is chemistry. The\npurification of silicon, enabling the computer and internet revolution, not to\nmention solar panels, is chemistry. Energy-efficient lighting due to white\nLEDs owes its development to yet more chemistry.\n\nChemistry has itself been enabled by advances in other disciplines, notably\nphysics. The discovery of quantum mechanics in the early twentieth century\nadvanced our theoretical understanding of chemistry, and many chemical\nreactions and behaviours can now be predicted using sophisticated computer\nprograms.\n\nAt the same time, chemists\u2019 study of molecules and atoms provided crucial data\nto physicists looking for that deeper understanding.\n\n## Chemistry and the future\n\nChemists are also working on solutions for the future.\n\nTake batteries. The lithium on which today\u2019s rechargeable batteries run is a\nscarce element. It is difficult to isolate, and its extraction is not without\nenvironmental drawbacks. Many chemists are working on alternatives. The\nbatteries of the future might be based on sodium, for example, or some other\nchemistry yet to be developed.\n\nThe next generation of solar cells needs new materials. These are being\nsynthesised by chemists, and rapidly tested in devices. Chemists have\ndiscovered materials that can work with silicon to pull more usable energy\nfrom sunlight, and that can make solar cells extremely lightweight and\nflexible.\n\nRead more: Green chemistry is key to reducing waste and improving\nsustainability\n\nIf we are to produce hydrogen as a clean fuel, we will need new catalysts to\nmake the required chemical reactions faster.\n\nChemists continue to work hand in hand with clinicians on solutions to\ntreating diseases, from rare conditions to unfortunately common cancers. We\nare developing new antibiotics, and antimicrobial coatings for medical\ndevices.\n\nChemists also study the natural world, and how we affect it. Climate change\nmight have its roots in chemical reactions releasing CO2 into the atmosphere,\nbut stabilising the climate will also require chemists to invent new ways to\ncapture and store CO2, or convert it to something else.\n\n## The central science\n\nEven leaving aside the countless crucial applications of chemistry,\nfundamental chemical research born from pure curiosity is of vital importance.\nThis work leads to solutions for problems we don\u2019t yet know we are going to\nhave.\n\nChemistry is sometimes seen as an \u201cold\u201d science: one that\u2019s taught in high\nschool but doesn\u2019t prepare students for jobs in the real world. At best,\nchemistry is often seen as something that will get you a job in a horribly\npolluting industry.\n\nBut not always. At a kid\u2019s birthday party the other day, a couple of GPs asked\none of us what we did. Instead of the usual response to the mention of\nchemistry, the reply came as a pleasant surprise: \u201cYou enable the whole field\nof medicine,\u201d they said.\n\nAs we have seen, chemistry is a subject that is at the core of past and future\nadvances in society. It is still the central science.\n\n  * Chemistry\n  * Science\n  * Public understanding of science\n  * Materials science\n  * PFAS\n  * Toxic chemicals\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Executive Dean, Faculty of Health\n\n  * ##### Regional Engagement Officer - Shepparton\n\n  * ##### Lecturer/Senior Lecturer, Earth System Science (School of Science)\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
