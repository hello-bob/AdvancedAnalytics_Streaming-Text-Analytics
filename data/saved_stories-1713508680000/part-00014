The\ndeal was worth well over $70 billion once closed, and gave Microsoft control\nover Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and various other billion-dollar\nfranchises. Microsoft also now owns Bethesda, who recently launched hit TV\nshow Fallout in partnership with Amazon. It owns Minecraft, which remains one\nof, if not the biggest game in the world. Microsoft also owns the greatest\ngame of all time, DOOM, which can run on literally anything. Okay, you get the\npoint.\n\nIn any case, Microsoft has focused its efforts on its key strengths, notably\nsoftware and throwing money around. And to that end, it has effectively become\none of, if not the biggest player on PlayStation, in a stunning turn around\nnobody would have foreseen ten years ago.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM windowscentral\n\n> Microsoft currently has more games on the PlayStation Store's top 25 best-\n> sellers list than Sony does.The list includes 2x Fallout games and 2x first-\n> party Microsoft titles that were previously only available on Xbox\n> consoles.https://t.co/wE2trMBy0yApril 18, 2024\n\nSee more\n\nIn analysis from Strickland, seven of the top 20 most-purchased games on\nPlayStation as of right now are all Microsoft-owned franchises. Call of Duty\nsits at the top as you might expect, followed by, Overwatch 2, Sea of Thieves,\nFallout 4, Minecraft, Fallout 76, and Grounded.\n\nFallout 4 and Fallout 76 are enjoying a massive bump from the hit TV series\nthat just hit Amazon Prime. Sea of Thieves is launching on PlayStation for the\nfirst time after casting off its console-exclusive shackles. Overwatch 2 just\ngot a new season, with some much-needed changes. And, well, Call of Duty and\nMinecraft are just Call of Duty and Minecraft.\n\nIt represents a bold new world for Microsoft, where the price of ballooning\ncosts and runaway inflation and sticky silicon prices have seen it break\ntraditions in order to find more growth. None of this means it's getting out\nof developing its own hardware mind, since Microsoft learned the hard way with\nWindows Phone what happens when you completely remove yourself from the\nplatform equation. Indeed, Microsoft confirmed repeatedly over the last year\nthat it is working on new Xbox hardware to compete with PlayStation, which\nwill now, at least in part, be subsidized by selling games on PlayStation's\nown store.\n\n## Get the Windows Central Newsletter\n\nAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n## The gaming landscape is changing\n\nValve is now selling its own \"console\" hardware, complete with \"exclusives\"\nfrom both Xbox and PlayStation, rendering the console exclusivity argument\nkind of redundant.

The\n\"console exclusive\" Sea of Thieves was running side by side against the\n\"console exclusive\" God of War on the Steam Deck, which in some ways, renders\nthe whole console war redundant. Indeed, Microsoft has been teasing its intent\nto open up Xbox itself to similar policies, allowing competing stores onto the\nXbox platform in much the same way the Steam Deck can run Battle.net and the\nGenshin Impact launcher if you're willing to do some tweaking.\n\nIncreasingly, as margins in console gaming get squeezed by mobile and PC\ngaming, closed platform holders are rethinking their approaches \u2014 particularly\ngiven the unfavorable regulatory landscape across the U.S. and EU, as both\nregions battle Apple to open up its platform to competitors. It seems\nMicrosoft is ahead of the curve here in some respects. Will we eventually see\nPlayStation games running on Xbox console hardware via Steam some day? Maybe\nnot, but honestly, crazier things are happening in gaming right now.\n\nToday's best gaming deals\n\nRecompile - Sony...Recompile - Sony PlayStation 5 - Action/Abenteuer - PEGI 12\n\n\u20ac9.63\n\nView\n\nat Proshop DE\n\nSony Die After...Sony Die After Sunset - PS5 - Plattform: Playstation 5 Genre:\nShooter USK-Einstufung: Freigegeben ab 12 Jahren (447104)\n\n\u20ac29.25\n\nView\n\nat JACOB Elektronik DE\n\nSONY Media...SONY Media Controller - PlayStation 5\n\n\u20ac39\n\nView\n\nat Amazon\n\nXbox, Series S -...Xbox, Series S - 1TB Carbon Black\n\n\u20ac329.99\n\nView\n\nat OTTO DE\n\nXbox Series X...Xbox Series X (1TB) Bundle inkl.
