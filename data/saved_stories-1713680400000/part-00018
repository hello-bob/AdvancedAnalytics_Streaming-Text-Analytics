Whether it\u2019s old personal computer platforms, vending machines,\nrobot arms, or educational kits based on retro platforms, you will need to\nwork with parallel EEPROM chips at some point. [Anders Nielsen] was about to\ndo just that, when he found out that a TL866, a commonly used programmer kit\nfor such ROMs, would cost entire $70 \u2013 significantly raising the budget of any\nparallel ROM-involving hacking. After months of work, he is happy to bring us\na project \u2013 the Relatively Universal ROM Programmer, an open-source parallel\nROM programmer board that you can easily assemble or buy.\n\nDesigned in the Arduino shield format, there\u2019s a lot of care and love put into\nmaking this board as universal as reasonably possible, so that it fits any of\nthe old flash chips you might want to flash \u2013 whether it\u2019s an old UV-erasable\nROM that wants a voltage up to 30 V to be written, or the newer 5 V-friendly\nchips. You can use ICs with pin count from 24 to 32 pins, it\u2019s straightforward\nto use a ZIF socket with this board, there\u2019s LED indication and silkscreen\nmarkings so that you can see and tweak the programming process, and it\u2019s\nmasterfully optimized for automated assembly.\n\nYou can breadboard this programmer platform as we\u2019ve previously covered, you\ncan assemble our own boards using the open-source files, and if you don\u2019t want\nto do either, you can buy the assembled boards from [Anders Nielsen] too! The\nsoftware is currently work in progress, since that\u2019s part of the secret sauce\nthat makes the $70 programmers tick. You do need to adjust the programming\nvoltage manually, but that can be later improved with a small hardware fix. In\ntotal, if you just want to program a few ROM chips, this board saves you a\nfair bit of money.\n\nPosted in Repair Hacks, Retrocomputing, Tool HacksTagged 6502, 65uino, eeprom,\nprogrammer, rom, W27C512\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.\n(Comment Policy)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
