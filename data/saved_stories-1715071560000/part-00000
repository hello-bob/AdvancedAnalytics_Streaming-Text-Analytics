But gradually an addiction to silence turned into a craving for the\nhermit's life ...\n\nSara Maitland\n\nSat 8 Nov 2008 01.01 CET\n\nShare\n\nI have lived a very noisy life. As a matter of fact we all live very noisy\nlives. But for everyone who complains about RAF low-flying training exercises,\nbackground music in public places, loud neighbours and drunken brawling on the\nstreets, there are hundreds who know they need a mobile phone, who choose to\nhave incessant sound pumping into their homes and their ears, and who feel\nuncomfortable or scared when they have to confront real silence.\n\"Communication\" (which always means talk) is the sine qua non of \"good\nrelationships\". \"Alone\" and \"lonely\" have become almost synonymous; worse,\nperhaps, \"silent\" and \"bored\" seem to be moving closer together, too.\n\nMy life has also been noisy in a more specific way. I was born in 1950, the\nsecond child in a family of six. My parents were deeply sociable and the house\nwas constantly filled by their and our friends. Introspection, solitude,\nsilence or any withdrawal from the herd were not allowed. Later, I was sent to\nboarding school, a place where the entire ethos depended on no one ever being\nallowed any silence or privacy except as a punishment, and where the constant\ndin created by 200 young women was amplified by bare corridors and echoing\nrooms. From school I went to Oxford, where to speak out (and, to be honest,\nshout down the opposition) was not only permissible, it was virtuous. In 1972\nI married an Anglican vicar: a vicarage is the least quiet place imaginable -\na house that is never your own and never empty or silent.\n\nI liked my noisy life. All that talking. I love talking. I used to say that if\nI were ever in Who's Who I would put down deipnosophy as my hobby. Deipnosophy\nmeans the \"love of, or skill of, dinner-table conversation\". And it was an\nextremely happy life. I achieved my personal ambitions. I had two beautiful\nchildren. I felt respected and useful and satisfied.\n\nThen, at the very end of the 80s, that well ran dry. My marriage\ndisintegrated. As a writer, I ran out of steam. In the early years of the 90s,\nI was suddenly living on my own for the first time in my life, in a small\nvillage in Northamptonshire. The entirely unexpected thing was that I loved\nit.\n\nI discovered the silent joy of gardening: cells divide, sap flows, bacteria\nmultiply, energy runs thrilling through the earth, but without a murmur.\nGardening gave me a way to work with silence; not \"in silence\" but \"with\nsilence\" - it was a silent creativity. Another of the things I started to do\nduring this time was what Buddhists normally call \"meditation\" or, in\nChristian terms, \"contemplative prayer\". It began to supersede deipnosophy as\nmy favourite hobby.\n\nThe most important thing that happened was that I got interested in silence\nitself. All our contemporary thinking about silence sees it as an absence or a\nlack of speech or sound - a totally negative condition. But I was not\nexperiencing it like that. Instead I increasingly identified an interior\ndimension to silence, a sort of stillness of heart and mind which is not a\nvoid but a rich space.\n\nSilence resists attempts to explain it. Indeed, ineffability is one of the key\ntests of mystical experience. I might even say that the \"best\" hermits are\nthose who have least to say about it. The only thing Tenzin Palmo, a British\nBuddhist nun who spent three years high in the Himalayas in radical silence,\nseems ever to have said - at least publicly - about her personal experience\nis, \"Well, it wasn't boring.\"\n\nI decided to forge a life with silence at the very centre of it, but it was\nclear that this could not happen in Northamptonshire. Oddly enough, village\nlife, although peaceful and often tranquil, is one of the least silent ways of\nliving. You can be alone in the wild, and invisible in a city; in a village\nyou are known and seen and involved. What called to me was space, wide, wild\nspace - the \"huge nothing\" of the high moorlands. I wanted to live there in\nsilence.\n\nPeople asked me why. People still ask me why. Why leave the south where you\nhave been happy for so long, where your friends and your children and your\nwork are? Ladylike retirement for rural peace and quiet makes sense, but why\ngo to such extremes? Sometimes I would joke, \"It's a tough job, but somebody\nhas to do it,\" or say - like Mallory - \"Because it's there.\" But in honesty I\nwas serious.\n\nI was encouraged by other individuals who had sought out extreme solitude.\nRichard Byrd, a US admiral and polar explorer, said about his decision to\nspend a winter alone in the Antarctic: \"I wanted to go for experience's sake:\none man's desire to know that kind of experience to the full, to be by himself\nfor a while and to taste the peace and quiet and solitude long enough to find\nout how good they really are... I wanted something more than just privacy in\nthe geographical sense. I should be able to live exactly as I chose, obedient\nto no necessities but those imposed by wind and night and cold, and to no\nman's laws but my own.\"\n\nI was looking for something similar. If I had said to people, \"I am in love\nwith someone and we are going to live on an isolated moor\", I doubt anyone\nwould have said \"Why?\" in quite the same way. But I was falling in love with\nsilence, and like most people with a new love, I became increasingly obsessed\n- wanting to know more, to go further, to understand better. So in the summer\nof 2000 I moved north to County Durham, to a house on a moor high above\nWeardale. I started to walk a good deal. I felt increasingly pared down, lean,\nfit and quiet, shacked up, as it were, with the wind and the silence and the\ncold.\n\nHowever, I also began to realise that Richard Byrd had been right when he\nspeculated that \"no man can hope to be completely free who lingers within\nreach of familiar habits and urgencies\". In the contemporary western world it\nis difficult to be silent for long - people phone, they come to visit, to\ncanvass your vote, the postman needs a signature, Jehovah's Witnesses knock\npolitely, someone has to read the meter, you run out of milk and have to go\nand buy some more, and the woman in the village shop starts to chat. In fact,\nit is impossible. Moreover, there are what Byrd calls \"urgencies\" - the\neconomic urgency of making a living, and the emotional urgency of love and\nfriendship. I was living more silently than before, but I still was only\ndabbling on the margins of that deep ocean I sensed was there. I decided that\nI would go away and spend some time doing nothing except being silent and\nthinking about it. Forty days seemed a suitable amount of time.\n\nI rented a cottage on Skye: small, isolated, with no TV. In late October, my\ncar laden with foul-weather gear and six weeks' worth of food, I left my\nsister's house near St Andrews and drove east to west across Scotland. It was\na long drive, and all the time I had a growing sense of moving away - the\nroads getting narrower, the houses less frequent, the towns more like villages\nand the villages tiny. I was exhausted by the time I had arrived and settled\nin, but I also had a powerful sense of excitement and optimism. I was at the\nbeginning of an adventure. I felt oddly foxy - I'd slipped my leash and got\naway.\n\nAt one level, Allt Dearg was never completely silent. The wind roared down\nfrom the mountains more or less incessantly. When it rained, which it did a\ngreat deal, I could hear it lashing on the roof-light windows upstairs. Even\nwhen the wind and rain paused, the burn did not. Just behind the house, it\ndescended sharply in a series of small waterfalls, and they sounded like\ndistant aeroplane engines. Yet my sense was that none of these noises\nmattered; they did not break up the silence, which I could listen for and hear\nbehind them.\n\nFor the first few days I wallowed in freedom: no phone calls, no emails, no\nneighbours. I tried to settle into the silence and somehow lower my own\nexpectations - to plan, scheme, rule, manage the days as little as possible.\nUnlike sound, which crashes against your ears, silence is subtle. The more and\nthe longer you are silent, the more you hear the tiny noises within the\nsilence, so that silence itself is always slipping away like a timid wild\nanimal.\n\nPeople ask me what I did all day. I prayed and meditated. I read a bit. I\nwalked a good deal, but I was restricted by the vileness of the weather and\nthe very early nightfall that far north in November and December. I worked on\nsome very intricate sewing. And I listened to the silence, and I listened to\nmyself.\n\nThe first effect that I noticed, towards the end of the first week, was an\nextraordinary intensification of physical sensation. My sense of body\ntemperature became more acute - if I was wet, or cold, or warm, I experienced\nthis very directly and totally. I have never been so physically tired, so\naware of weather, of sound, and of the variety of colour in the wild\nenvironment. Before long my emotions also swelled into monumental waves of\nfeeling - floods of tears, giggles, excitement or anxiety, often entirely\ndisproportionate to the occasion. It felt normal. These were not new or\ninexplicable feelings; they were the old ones felt more strongly.\n\nI was quite shocked to find how quickly and easily I abandoned many of the\ndaily activities I'd assumed were \"natural\" or necessary, like washing, or\nbrushing my hair. It was curious to discover how far I had internalised\nprohibitions on things like shouting, laughing, singing, farting, taking all\nyour clothes off, picking your nose while eating and so on. These inhibitions\nfell away at various rates. I felt as though the silence unskinned me. I\nstepped back into infancy, into the wild, \"beyond the pale\". I found myself,\nfor example, overwhelmed by bizarre sexual fantasies and vengeful rages of\nkinds that I had never dared admit.\n\nAlmost every account of prolonged silence I have ever read contains mentions\nof \"hearing voices\", whether these come in the form of divine intervention or\ntongues of madness. In my journal I repeatedly recorded my sense that I could\nhear singing. One evening I heard a male-voice choir singing Latin plainsong\nin the bedroom. Almost immediately I realised that this was ridiculous; the\nacoustics were all wrong. But I could hear singing, and I could pick up\noccasional words.\n\nOn one unusually radiant day, I took a walk up the burn above the house and\ninto a steep-sided corrie. It was sheltered there and magnificent - mountains\non both sides, and below, tiny stands of water which looked like handfuls of\nshiny coins tossed down. I sat on a rock and ate cheese sandwiches. And there,\nquite suddenly, I slipped a gear. There was not me and the landscape, but a\nkind of oneness: as though the molecules and atoms I am made of had reunited\nthemselves with the molecules and atoms that the rest of the world is made of.\nIt was very brief, but I cannot remember feeling that extraordinary sense of\nconnectedness since I was a small child.\n\nAs the six weeks went by, I found it harder to maintain a sense of time\npassing. This is clearly something that a lot of people in silence and\nsolitude find difficult. Over and over again I found accounts of people\nfinding ways to replace clocks and diaries - marking each day as it passes\nwith a notch on a stick or a stone on a cairn, inventing or at least\ncontriving \"tasks\". However, I enjoyed this sensation; it gave me a sense of\nfreedom coupled with a sort of almost childlike naughtiness.\n\nLater, I had a series of very strange experiences when I stopped being able to\ndistinguish easily between what was happening in my mind and what was\nhappening \"outside\". One, in my fourth week, stands out: I heard a vehicle\ncome up the track and a white van crossed the window. Then nothing happened. I\nwas furious at the interruption. But nothing happening was strange - no knock\non the door, no sound outside. Then there was a series of piercing whistles. I\nwas hiding from any intrusion in the bedroom and, looking out the window, I\nsaw a sheepdog on the far bank of the burn. I pulled on my jacket and went out\n- the wind was howling and the rain lashing down. I stood at the door. The\nsheepdog had four sheep huddled on the far side of the burn, and on my side\nwas a shepherd, a scruffy bloke in a blue woolly hat. When he saw me he called\nthe dog, who let the sheep go and came splashing back across the burn. The\nshepherd smiled at me and said, \"I was looking for a stray.\" Then I went back\ninto the house and he got back into the white van (which had a large dent in\nthe driver-side door) and drove away. I never said anything.\n\nThe scary bit is that I am not sure whether this actually happened, or whether\nI imagined it. I attempted a \"reality check\": my jacket was bone dry - but\nthen I had not left the shelter of the doorway. If it was a hallucination, it\nwas both bizarrely mundane and ridiculously detailed. But why would anyone\nchase a stray in this weather - or, having decided to do so, abandon the\nproject so quickly?\n\nReading my journal, I realise with what insouciance I seem to have regarded\nsuch episodes, which in my pre-silence life would have terrified me as signs\nof incipient lunacy. I had only one seriously frightening experience while I\nwas on Skye. One morning I decided I would take a walk from Luib to Loch\nSlapin - from sea to sea along a well-marked track between the mountains. It\nwas a strange day, very still with no wind. I left the car and walked up the\npath, and after a couple of hundred yards it turned round a knoll and I walked\ninto a tight, steep-sided glen that I could not see out of. Nowhere. No one.\nNothing. The path was boggy and hard work. I came to a little loch with reeds\nstanding in the perfectly clear water, which reflected the hills rising\nsharply either side. At first I was enchanted, then, abruptly, I was spooked.\n\nIn the silence and the mist, I found myself becoming increasingly uneasy. I\nbecame convinced I was being watched. There were two black shapes on the hill\nabove me. I thought, or rather I felt, that they were alive, although\nrationally, I decided that they must be rocks. I felt the silence stripping me\ndown. I could hear the silence screaming. Adventurer Augustine Courtauld, who\nspent six months alone in a tent in the Arctic, recorded strange and\ninexplicable screaming noises and said, afterwards, that it was the only thing\nthat really frightened him.\n\nI ran and stumbled out of the valley, as though there were something dark in\npursuit. Back at the car I found I was soaked to the skin and covered in mud,\nalthough I had no memory of falling. The sane me said, \"This is silly\" but I\nwas also at the mercy of the sensation. One part of me was delighted and\nreassured that that was as bad as it got on Skye - obviously silence suited\nme. At another level, I felt somehow slightly cheated. I wanted to experience\nthe whole of silence: the dark disintegration, the howling emptiness, the\ndemons of the desert hermits.\n\nThen, that winter, back home in Weardale, I got snowed in. Early in 2001 there\nwas a major outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. It was horrible. The markets\nwere closed, people did not want to visit other farms or have people on\ntheirs. The moors, like the rest of the countryside, were closed to walkers.\n\nIn late March there was severe snow and blizzards. The rural roads of County\nDurham are normally snowploughed by farmers, but they were confined to their\nfarms by the outbreak, so the road to and from my house soon became\nimpassable. With little preparation, I was alone and locked into an\ninvoluntary period of silence. The telephone lines were down, and with no\nradio or television I had no idea what was going on in the \"real world\" or how\nthe epidemic was spreading. I became increasingly scared. Some of the anxiety\nwas realistic - would I eventually run out of food (or more seriously, in my\ncase, of cigarettes)? What would happen if the weather did not improve? Was my\nfamily all right? But more of it was emotional - despite the fact that I was\nsupposedly longing for quiet, I increasingly felt invaded.\n\nI realised that snow produces a peculiar acoustic effect: it mutes nearby\nnoises but causes distant sounds to carry farther, with startling clarity. In\naddition, the snow flattens everything visually. The effect is disorientating.\nOne day, walking to my gate, the collar of my jacket blew up against the back\nof my head and I screamed aloud, convinced I had been attacked from behind. It\nwas baffling. Why had six whole weeks far from home, and in almost equally\nunfavourable weather, filled me with delight - even ecstasy - while barely 10\ndays in my own home with my own things around me reduced me to semi-hysteria?\nI now believe that the determining factor in whether a silence ends up feeling\npositive or negative is whether or not it was freely chosen. Chosen silence\ncan be creative and generate self-knowledge, integration and profound joy;\nbeing silenced can drive people mad.\n\nMy assumption had been that silence was monotone; that it would be very pure,\nvery beautiful but somehow flat, undifferentiated. But the more silences I\nencountered, the more silent places I inhabited, the more I became aware that\nthere were dense, interwoven strands of different silences. Silence can be\ncalm or frightening, lonely or joyful, deep or thin. There is religious\nsilence; a self-emptying silence, and romantic silence - what Wordsworth\ncalled the \"bliss of solitude\".\n\nAfter the whiteout, I decided to move house again. I wanted more silence, I\ndid not want such immediate neighbours nor so much space. What I needed was a\nhermitage.\n\nHow much stuff did I really need to live happily? First I got rid of things\nthat made noises. I never had a mobile phone, the television had long gone,\nlikewise the radio. The sound-generating programmes on the computer went next.\nI kept the car radio for longer, but eventually it broke and I have not\nreplaced it.\n\nSoon I discovered that a person living alone in the country does not need a\ndoorbell or a microwave oven, and certainly has no use for a tumble dryer.\nSome modern inventions, however, make silence a great deal simpler. Email is a\nwonderfully non-intrusive communication tool, an answering machine means that\nI can unplug the phone without inconveniencing anyone, and online shopping\nresolves a great many dilemmas. Above all, in my case, a computer goes a very\nlong way to solving the financial difficulties of living in extreme rural\nsolitude: I live now mainly by teaching creative writing online.\n\nGradually, I began to be clear about what I was trying to do. I am not a \"back\nto nature\" survivalist. I do not want to grow all my own vegetables, live\nwithout cigarettes or coffee, knit or weave my own clothes, or write with a\nquill pen. I do not want to struggle each day to milk my goat, or forage for\nwood. And even if I did, there would still be council tax. What I want to do\nis live in as much silence as is possible at this point in our history.\n\nI spent months looking for my house in the Scottish Borders. I knew what I\nwanted: a small house with a big room. I wanted to integrate living, working\nand praying into a single whole, and I did not want any rooms that I did not\nuse. I also wanted a very particular landscape: high moorland, a huge and\nsilent nothing of peat bog, rough grass, bracken, broken walls enclosing no\nfields and the harsh cry of curlew. I would need a kitchen and a bathroom. My\nasceticism does not run to cold-water strip-downs.\n\nA derelict little shepherd's house finally came up for sale. Empty for nearly\nhalf a century, it had no roof, no water supply, two feet of sheep dung on the\nfloor and a tree growing out the front wall. Of course I bought it.\n\nThe glorious intensity of those six weeks in Skye is not, in the long term,\nsustainable. But you can do a surprising number of things without speaking.\nOne of the seldom mentioned advantages of supermarkets is that you can shop\nwithout exchanging a word, smiling at the staff's mechanical greetings and\nfixing your eyes on your list in order to avoid eye contact with anyone.\nHowever, there is something bogus about that, and rude.\n\nSay I am walking alone and high on a narrow track. The day has been silent\nexcept for the sound of streams and a distant caw from a crow - and lo and\nbehold, coming towards me is a group of cheerful walkers. I know they will say\n\"Hello\" and what do I do? Duck behind a rock? Increase my pace and smile\nswiftly as I pass? It is less \"noisy\" and more rational to say \"Hello\" back.\n\nThe questions have really become about how much everyday silence I can create.\nAt the moment I am aiming for 80%. Two days a week I unplug the phone and with\nit the internet and email. I try to limit all social activities to a maximum\nof six days a month, but it can be tricky because unexpected things happen,\nand people other than I have needs and desires.\n\nI pray for about three hours a day. I earn my keep, I walk, I read, I do my\nsewing. I am extremely happy in my little house, but I still find silence\ndeeply mysterious - certainly not an absence but in many instances something\nstrongly positive. There is the intimacy between mother and infant at the end\nof the night feed. There are those awed responses to the \"natural\" world, in\nwhich words fail or rather step back from the experience. There is the\npositive psychoanalytic silence that seems to allow a new kind of self-\nknowing. There is the aftermath of seriously good sex. There is the silence of\nmystical experience. There is the particular silence in some sorts of reading\nwhere writer and reader work at meaning-making together. There is the silence\nin listening to music.\n\nSilence does not seem to be a loss or lack of language; it does not even seem\nto be the opposite of language. I have found it to be a whole world in and of\nitself, alongside language and culture, but independent of it. It comes from a\ndifferent place altogether.\n\nSo here I am, sitting on my doorstep in the sunshine, looking out at my huge\nnothing. I don't feel worried about falling over the edge of a bottomless\nchasm, but rather I have a sense of moving up a level, into some finer,\ncleaner air.\n\n\u00a9 Sara Maitland, 2008\n\nThis is an edited extract from A Book Of Silence, by Sara Maitland, published\nby Granta on November 13 at \u00a317.99.
