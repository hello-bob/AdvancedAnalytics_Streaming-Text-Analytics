And every person who\nlives in one.\n\nAhead of today, we\u2019ve transferred over 240 projects, standards, drivers, and\nlibraries\u2014Home Assistant, ESPHome, Zigpy, Piper, Improv Wi-Fi, Wyoming, and so\nmany more\u2014to the Open Home Foundation. This is all about looking into the\nfuture. We\u2019ve done this to create a bulwark against surveillance capitalism,\nthe risk of buyout, and open-source projects becoming abandonware. To an\nextent, this protection extends even against our future selves\u2014so that smart\nhome users can continue to benefit for years, if not decades. No matter what\ncomes.\n\nBut the work of the Open Home Foundation doesn\u2019t stop there. Through close\npartnership with Nabu Casa, the foundation funds, directs resources to, and\ncollaborates on the development of critical external projects like Z-Wave JS,\nWLED, Rhasspy, and Zigbee2MQTT. Our main requirements are that the projects\nremain open to everyone, and aligned with our core principles.\n\nThis is what we\u2019ve already done.\n\n## Our ambitions go further\n\nOur aim is to have the resources to be an active political advocate. Serving\nto educate the public, public servants, and the companies making smart home\ndevices and services, about the importance of open standards, open-source\nprojects, and privacy, choice, and sustainability when it comes to the future\nof smart homes.\n\nHere\u2019s how we understand these principles:\n\n### Privacy\n\nPrivacy means you control your data. Nobody, and no company or organization,\nhas a right to know what you do in your home, with whom you meet or associate,\nor how you choose to live\u2014without your explicit permission. You should only\nshare this information if you freely make the choice to do so without external\npressure. That\u2019s why your devices need to work locally. It\u2019s OK for a product\nto offer a cloud connection\u2014but its main functionality should work without the\ncloud. And the use of cloud services should always be opt-in and clearly\ndescribed.\n\nYou should never have to worry about being yourself to avoid being tracked or\nclassified by an algorithm. You should be able to live your life\u2014because\nnobody is watching.\n\n### Choice\n\nChoice means you have the freedom to use any device, with any other, from any\nmanufacturers, any way you like\u2014for as long as you want. To make this\npossible, vendors must not arbitrarily limit the interoperability of their\ndevices with the rest of your smart home. Control of those devices, and\nmanagement of data they gather, should operate via open standards and local\nAPIs.\n\nYou should be able to design your personal smart home\u2014the way you imagine it.\n\n### Sustainability\n\nSustainability means being able to use and repurpose old appliances, smart\ndevices, and other durable hardware beyond commercially-limited lifetimes as\nyour smart home evolves. But it also means having the tools to limit your\nenvironmental impact by tracking, automating, and reducing waste and\nemissions.\n\nYou should be able to embrace the convenience of a smart home without\ncompromising your ability to cut utility bills\u2014and your carbon footprint.\n\n## Getting here didn\u2019t follow a linear path\n\nAs many people in this community already know, the Home Assistant Journey\nstarted over 10 years ago when Paulus Schoutsen wrote a few lines of Python to\ntake control of his Philips Hue smart lights. His motivation was greater\ncontrol over the devices he\u2019d purchased\u2014rather than letting a corporate giant\ndecide what was best for his home.\n\nThis act struck such a chord that over the coming years, thousands of mostly\nvolunteer contributors transformed that first script into a leading smart home\nplatform. They also built an entire ecosystem of projects around it.\n\nBut two other critical trends also took place, one far more troubling: The\nsmart home landscape grew dominated by companies whose purpose was to sell you\nnew devices on a schedule to please their shareholders\u2014while siphoning off\nyour personal data for financial gain.\n\nThe other trend was Schoutsen and others approaching burn-out as they tried to\nkeep their various projects thriving\u2014doing most of their coding after coming\nhome from their real jobs, on weekends, and when bugs needed squashing.\n\nTo address this, Schoutsen, Ben Bangert, and Pascal Vizeli founded Nabu Casa\nin 2018 as a for-profit company. The goal was to stabilize Home Assistant, and\nbolster its longevity, by injecting predictable funding for future\ndevelopment. Nabu Casa also bought ESPHome, with the same purpose in mind.\n\nEarly on, some people questioned whether starting a for-profit company was an\naltruistic move. But over the following years, Nabu Casa established a clear\nand accountable track record. This included practicing what it preached:\nSpeaking up to protect open-source ideals when other developers came under\nthreat; directing full-time employees to devote their days to open-source,\ncommunity-driven, smart home projects; and joining organizations like the\nConnectivity Standards Alliance and Z-Wave Alliance, and the general fight for\ncritical open standards like Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter.\n\nBy 2021, Schoutsen and others defined a concept called the open home, built\naround the principles of privacy, choice, and sustainability. But Home\nAssistant and other open home projects were still floating in a kind of\nundefined space between a for-profit entity and an open-source repository on\nGithub.\n\nSo in 2023, this core group of smart home developers decided to codify and\nprotect their ideals. And to create a formal home for the projects they and so\nmany other contributors had poured their souls, beliefs, and shared code into.\n\nIndividual efforts needed to be united. And in 2024, the Open Home Foundation\nwas created to unite them\u2014with a special, rules-bound, inaugural partner in\nNabu Casa to provide the majority of the funding.\n\n## Going forward will be a journey\n\nShare your ideas. Speak up. Contribute. Subscribe. Support. Tell us where we\ncan do better. Champion our cause.\n\nWe see this as a living project, in fitting with the mosaic threads of DNA\nthat represent our past.\n\nWe\u2019ve always stood for open-source, creativity, and taking initiative. And we\nhave no doubt that this organization will evolve over the years. We will\nremain true to our principles of privacy, choice, and sustainability for the\nsmart home. And always open to finding the best way to achieve our goals.\n\nWe hope you\u2019ll join us.\n\nPaulus Schoutsen, Guy Sie, Pascal Vizeli, J.
