This latest\nrelease in the MuseScore 4 series is the first to use the new MuseScore Studio\nbranding that we announced earlier this year. This version contains numerous\nfixes and improvements, including a new sound flags feature that provides\nadvanced control over score playback with Muse Sounds.\n\nMuseScore Studio remains free and open source under GPL version 3.\n\n## Watch the release video\n\nHaving trouble viewing this video? Click here to watch it on YouTube.\n\n## How to get MuseScore Studio 4.3 and Muse Sounds\n\n### I already have MuseScore 4\n\nIf you already have MuseScore 4 or later then you\u2019ll see a message about the\n4.3 update next time you launch the app. If you don\u2019t see the message, go to\nHelp > Check for update, or download the app manually instead.\n\nTo get the latest Muse Sounds, you\u2019ll need to use the Muse Hub utility\n(Windows and Mac) or Muse Sounds Manager (Linux). You can download this from\nmusehub.com if you don\u2019t have it already. Muse Hub can also be used to update\nor install MuseScore Studio.\n\n### I\u2019m new to MuseScore 4\n\nHead over to the Download page to see the available options.\n\nWindows and macOS: The main download option gives you the Muse Hub utility,\nwhich you can use to install MuseScore Studio and Muse Sounds. There's also\nthe option to download MuseScore Studio without Muse Hub if you prefer.\n\nLinux: The main download option will just give you MuseScore Studio; you\u2019ll\nalso need to download and install Muse Sounds Manager if you want to get the\nnew sounds. You can find additional builds on our GitHub Releases page,\nincluding a portable Windows EXE, as well as AppImages for 32- and 64-bit ARM\nLinux. Please note that Muse Sounds Manager is not currently available for ARM\nLinux.\n\n## New features in 4.3\n\n### Sound flags\n\nSound flags appear as a 'speaker' icon to the left of Stave Text elements.\nClicking this icon reveals a list of playback options that can be used to\ncontrol an instrument's sound from that point onwards in the score.\n\nAt present, the playback aspect of sound flags only works with Muse Sounds,\nnot SoundFont or VST. However, when you share a score that contains sound\nflags, stave text entered via the sound flags popup will still be visible to\nother users even if they don't have Muse Sounds installed.\n\n### Engraving\n\nNew options in Format > Style to:\n\n  * Hide clef and key signature after the first system\n  * Show ties and repeat fret numbers for tied notes in tablature\n\nPlus Various other improvements.\n\n### Version history\n\nFor those of you that choose to save scores to the cloud or publish to\nMuseScore.com, you'll find that MuseScore.com now offers the ability to back\nup and restore from previous versions of your scores.\n\n### MuseScore Studio branding\n\nThe new name helps to distinguish the desktop program from other MuseScore\nproducts, such as the MuseScore.com and mobile apps.\n\nWhile the name has changed to \"MuseScore Studio\", for compatibility reasons\nmany files and folders relating to the desktop program are still called\n\"MuseScore 4\".\n\n### Privacy policy\n\nWe had to update the privacy policy to reflect the name change to MuseScore\nStudio, so we also took this opportunity to clarify some of the wording around\ndata collected during error reporting (e.g. if MuseScore crashes). The actual\ndata being collected and stored on our servers has not changed; only the\nwording of the privacy policy has changed. Data is anonymized as soon as it is\ncollected. We do not store any personal information.\n\n### Other fixes & improvements\n\nSee completed tasks in the 4.3 project for the full list of changes.\n\n  * Reply\n\n#### Comments\n\nmeferris7\n\n\u2022 May 7, 2024 - 11:54\n\nWhere is the download? When I open 4.2.1 and \"Check for Latest version\" it\ntells me I'm up to date.

One thing I've been wanting is muted trumpet. That is, with a\nstraight mute, not a Harmon mute. When you apply the mute symbol (+) to\ntrumpets, it still applies a Harmon mute. This sound is very different from a\nstraight mute. Is there any plan to support a straight mute?\n\nReply\n\nhamsandwichnow\n\n\u2022 May 7, 2024 - 14:51\n\nIn reply to So I had high hopes for some... by meferris7\n\nI assume, with sound flags, this would be much easier. idk\n\nReply\n\nbradleykunda\n\n\u2022 May 7, 2024 - 15:03\n\nIn reply to So I had high hopes for some... by meferris7\n\nYeah, so the options you see in the \"sound flag\" popups are all taken from the\nsound libraries themselves. As we continue to expand the libraries, more\noptions will become available (without us needing to even update MuseScore\nStudio). I can confirm that different brass mutes are being worked on as we\nspeak :-)\n\nReply\n\nmeferris7\n\n\u2022 May 7, 2024 - 15:12\n\nIn reply to Yeah, so the options you see... by bradleykunda\n\nThank you, this enhancement would be HUGE!\n\nReply\n\nhamsandwichnow\n\n\u2022 May 7, 2024 - 14:58\n\nYay!!
