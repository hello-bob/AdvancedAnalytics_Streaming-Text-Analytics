The following day, wheeled vehicles immobilized by the\ntire-deflating caltrops became sitting ducks for subsequent air or artillery\nstrikes. Even an immobilized vehicle that gets recovered is at least\ntemporarily rendered unavailable and taxes maintenance capacity.\n\nPerhaps the best indication that Ukraine\u2019s caltrop tactic is proving effective\nis that Russian social media posts are complaining about it:\n\n\u201cNow the Armed Forces of Ukraine are actively dropping such \u2018thorns\u2019 on the\nroads used by our troops. According to their plan, after a puncture, the car\nstops and is destroyed by artillery fire or kamikaze drones.\u201d\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * Air Force\u2019s Combat Drone Saga Has Taken a Turn\n\nThe poster says that his Tiger infantry mobility vehicle ran over caltrops,\nbut managed to remain useable even with one tire completely destroyed.\n\nView full post on X\n\nAnother Russian, seemingly a mechanic, bemoans in a social media video:\n\n\u201cOur favorite Gaz truck. First mission, first combat loss. [The caltrop]\ndestroyed the wheel, they barely managed to get out. They drop these things\nfrom drones. Two URALs [most likely Ural-4320 6x6 medium trucks] with no\nwheels, and a GAZ-66 [4x4 truck] with no wheels arrived today.\u201d Pointing to\none of the Urals, he continued \u201cThis was supposed to be our warhorse, our\nsavior. Two wheels lost in two missions.\u201d\n\nView full post on X\n\nSeveral other Russian posts show use of caltrops to damage Russian tires.\n\nView full post on X\n\nView full post on X\n\nUkrainian use of caltrops dates back to the early days of the war. In one\nnotable example, blacksmiths working for \u2018Art of Steel\u2019\u2014a company specialized\nin fabricating medieval armor for reenactors\u2014began mass-producing caltrops\npresumably deployed by traditional terrestrial means. These caltrops with six-\ninch nails were chained together, making them easier to remove if needed.\n\nView full post on X\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * Rome Subway Construction Uncovers Military Home\n\nGiant caltrops were also seen being concealed under soft soil in ditches to\nimpede potential Russian attacks along Ukraine\u2019s border.\n\nThe idea to combine vertical-lift drones with caltrops appears to predate\nUkraine\u2019s battlefield use by five years when a civilian DJIA Matrice 600 drone\nwas showcased spraying caltrops at a Chinese exhibition in 2019.\n\nView full post on X\n\nBeside the traditional iron spike caltrops, Ukrainian forces also employ\ncaltrops made of twisted rebar, and may even use a configuration made of two\ncross-cutting triangles.\n\n## Caltrops: ancient weapons with modern uses\n\nCaltrops are typically made of conjoined iron spikes\u2014usually, they have three\npoints balancing against the ground with the fourth oriented upwards to pierce\nthe foot (or hooves, or tires) of unsuspecting enemies. Historical records\nshow that they have been used in warfare for at least 2,500 years. And due to\ntheir simplicity, armies that fell afoul of caltrops were quick to adopt their\nuse in subsequent conflicts.\n\nEarly caltrops had wooden spherical cores through which four spikes protruded.\nTheir primary purpose was to help infantry disable the mobility and momentum\nadvantage of cavalry, chariots, and even war elephants. The hooves of cavalry\nwere particularly susceptible to harm, but sandal-wearing infantry were at\nrisk as well. Besides the immediate hobbling effect, piercing injuries\ninflicted by caltrops are likely to become dangerously infected absent the\nintervention of modern medicine.\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * The Most Important Battles of World War II\n\nThe first recorded use of caltrops is the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BCE,\nduring which Persian King Darius III allegedly strewed the ground with \u2018crow\u2019s\nfeet\u2019 to foil the forces of Alexander the Great\u2014at least, as claimed in a\nhistory written five centuries later. Thereafter, various Greek principalities\nused caltrops as defensive obstacles to deter enemy attacks, a device copied\nby the Romans. The Greeks and Romans called them tribolos or tribulum\nrespectively. Roman writer Vegetius described caltrops as being a highly\neffective counter to formerly feared scythed chariots.\n\nCaltrops again played a major role in the Battle of Nisibis (217 AD), in which\nthe Roman forces of inexperienced Emperor Macrinus battled a Parthians army\nseeking to avenge a treacherous attack by Macrinus\u2019s predecessor. When\nMacrinus\u2019s javelin-armed light infantry was compelled to fall back by Parthian\nheavy cataphract cavalry (supported by horse archers), they left behind a\ndense field of caltrops that broke up the Parthian cavalry charge. This\nallowed Roman infantry to bog down the Parthian cavalry in three days of\nfighting, which concluded with a truce and financial concession by the Roman\nforce.\n\nCaltrops impaired another Persia-based force in the Battle of Jalula in the\nyear 634. This time, the Sashanids under Yazdgard III used caltrops to block\npassage to and from the Arab-held fortress of Jalula. Arab forces pretended to\nflee\u2014and then pounced as the Sashanid troops began clearing lanes through the\ncaltrops. The routed Sashanids suffered heavy casualties fleeing through their\nown caltrop fields.\n\nDiagram by Mohkum Shabbir//Wikimedia Commons\n\nDiagram showing how Persian forces deployed a barricade of caltrops and\ntrenches to bottle beseiged Muslim forces near Jalula. Ironically, the\nPersians were ambushed while passing through a clear lane in the caltrop field\nwith disastrous results.\n\nBy the Middle Ages, caltrops had spread from the Middle East to Europe and\nEast Asia, with the English coining the term \u2018caltrop\u2019 in reference to the\nthorny star thistle plant. The design was simplified by removing the central\nwooden ball in favor of hammering together two twisted strips of iron. They\nproved an important method for helping infantry and archers stave off elite\nheavy cavalry.\n\nJack Slimp Jr. (CCA-SA3)//Wikimedia Commons\n\nBarbed iron caltrop brought back from Vietnam War in 1968 by 1st Lt. Jack\nSlimp. Note the simpler modern construction involving two inter-twisted iron\nspikes.\n\nAt the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Scottish forces under Robert Bruces used\na combination of spiked pit traps and caltrops to break the momentum of Edward\nII\u2019s charging English knights. The maimed, disoriented and even dismounted\nshock cavalry was then dispatched by Scottish pike formations known as\nschiltrons. Bruce\u2019s victory ultimately forced the English king to recognize\nScottish independence.\n\nBruce had been advised to use caltrops by clan leader Malcom Drummond\u2014leading\nto the Drummond clan incorporating caltrops in its coat of arms. Indeed, the\ncaltrop\u2019s military significance led it to be adopted in the heraldry of noble\nhouses like Stirling, and even modern military units (notably the U.S. 3^rd\nMarine Division and the U.S. Army\u2019s III Corps.)\n\nThe English learned from the experiences, and deployed a barrage of caltrops\nto shield their longbowmen from charging French knights in the Battle of\nCrecy, then began stringing together caltrops on nets for use against each\nother in the War of the Roses\u2014particularly the first major battle at St.\nAlbans (1455).\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nPainting by Joseph Zimmermann depicting German Black Forest peasants at\nSch\u00f6nau throwing \u2019crow\u2019s feet\u2019 (caltrops) to impede attacking Swedish cavalry\nin 1634 during the devastating 30 Year\u2019s War. This image was then repainted in\n1771 to portray French attackers.\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * The Evolution of the American Tank\n\nChina\u2019s Chin dynasty purportedly deployed a 30-mile-deep belt of caltrops in\nfront of Pei Kou fort to stop Genghis Khan\u2019s Golden Horde in 1213. However, a\nMongol blockade successfully starved the garrison to eventual defeat. The\nsubsequent Yuan and Ming dynasties devised \u2018exploding caltrops\u2019\u2014spiky balls\nfilled with gunpowder.\n\nJapanese armies also employed both iron caltrops (makibishi) and \u2018organic\u2019\ntennenbishi adapted from dessicated water chestnut seed pods\u2014also known as\n\u2018water caltrops.\u2019\n\nDragos Negoita / 500px//Getty Images\n\nA dessicated water caltrop seed pod-used historically as a weapon in similar\nfashion to iron spike caltrops.\n\nSubsequent centuries saw sporadic use of caltrops; for example, Leonardo Da\nVinci drew schematics for catapult artillery to launch containers intended to\nspray caltrops in front of enemy armies. English colonists sailed to Jamestown\nwith caltrops in anticipation of hostilities with Native Americans. In India,\nlarge caltrops were devised specifically to injured war elephants. Caltrops\nwere also deployed by Russian troops against British cavalry during the Battle\nof Balaclava (1854), and even at sea, caltrops were employed to give boarding\nparties a nasty surprise.\n\nIronically, the gradual motorization of land armies in the 20^th century\nactually gave caltrops a new lease on life: sabotaging the tires of wheeled\nvehicles. Thus, U.S., British, and German special operations forces in World\nWar II all employed caltrops as sabotage weapons. Caltrops devised by the\nU.S.\u2019s OSS intelligence service had a hollow openings in the pins so the\nspikes didn\u2019t self-seal the puncture holes in tires.\n\nBritish Government//Wikimedia Commons\n\nGerman crow\u2019s foot caltrop, typically packed into air-dropped containers and\nsprayed over Allied roads and airfields during World War II.\n\nCaltrops also had applications with\u2014and against\u2014aircraft. German warplanes\n(Stuka, He-111, Ju-88 and Me-110) bombed Allied airfields and roads with cargo\nmunitions stuffed with 1,000 to 1,500 pyramidal \u2018crow\u2019s feet\u2019.\n\nIntended to always fall with a point upwards, in practice, one of the sharp\ntips often burrowed into the ground and leaves the flat base pointing upward.\nBut they were not wholly ineffective. In a letter to the Washington Post, U.S.\nArmy Air Force pilot L. Prouty recalled encountering caltrops while landing at\nAlgiers in a Model 18 passenger transport in November 1943:\n\nAs I circled the small base, the control tower called my attention to the fact\nthat an aircraft was burning on the side of the active runway and that I would\nhave to land on the other edge. There were fire trucks and an ambulance near\nthe burning plane. I chose my touchdown point carefully and slowed the\nLockheed Lodestar to its landing speed. I had not yet touched the ground when\nthe right tire exploded. We had hit the razor-sharp tip of a caltrop just at\ntouchdown. With the bad wheel on the sandy edge of the runway and the left\nwheel on the tarmac, I got the plane stopped without too much more trouble.\u201d\n\nThe emergency crews had their hands full and could see that we were not in big\ntrouble. One of the officers came out and informed us that on the previous\nnight a few German bombers had covered the base with the small metallic\nweapons.\u201d\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * The Century Weapons\n\nThe air-dropping delivery method attracted U.S. military interest. For\nOperation Tack on Feb. 4, 1951, U.S. C-47 cargo planes flying at dangerously\nlow altitude (10-20 feet high) at night sprayed eight tons of 1.5\u201d roofing\nnails and caltrops with tire-puncturing barbs (known as \u2018tetrahedrons\u2019) over\nmajor highways used by Chinese and North Korean supply trucks. The following\nday, warplanes blasted 28 trucks immobilized by the caltrops and nails (though\na news report claims a higher toll of 65 vehicles). This compelled Communist\nforces to send scouts on foot ahead of vehicle convoys to detect caltrops,\nslowing those convoys down.\n\nUSAF//Wikimedia Commons\n\nExhibit at U.S. Air Force Museum depicting air-dropped caltrops and their\naffects on vehicle tires. Note the hollow points intended to ensure deflation\nof tires after penetration.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how frequently this method was used again, however. A U.S. Air\nForce museum exhibit states this \u201c...concept proved to be impractical and was\ndiscontinued.\u201d Yet the same method was employed against Viet Cong and\nVietnamese supply lines on the Ho Chi Minh trail during the Vietnam War.\nVietnamese guerillas were also known to deploy caltrops to sabotage airbases\nand bring convoys screeching to a halt for ambushes.\n\nCaltrops also re-emerged as anti-personnel, deployed by UN forces to hinder\nChinese human wave attacks during the Korean War. And more recently, caltrops\n(or \u201cjack rocks\u201d) have been used by civilians barring access to factories in\nlabor disputes, and by protesters or criminals seeking to disable law\nenforcement vehicles (a tactic portrayed in the gangster film Heat.)\n\nThe caltrop\u2019s physical configuration is also observable in anti-tank\nobstacles, like the \u2018Czech Hedgehogs\u2019 arrayed at Normandy during the D-Day\nlanding. But while they serve an area denial role, such easily-spotted\nobstacles function in a fundamentally different way than a caltrop.\n\nScience & Society Picture Library//Getty Images\n\nTire Deflation Device used by British police for use as rapid-deployable\nvehicle barricades.\n\nMore comparable in function, but not in form, are the \u2018spike strips\u2019 (or Tire\nDeflation Devices) used by modern militaries in vehicular barricades or\ncheckpoints. Spike strips have the advantage of being easier to safely recover\nthan caltrops liberally sprayed over a wide area, which pose a similar long-\nterm \u2018contamination\u2019 problem to land mines.\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * How the M2 Became the U.S. Military\u2019s Favorite Gun\n\nUkraine\u2019s use of drone-dropped caltrops in the 21^st century reflects a new\nand more offensive deployment method, much as drones and rocket artillery are\nalso being used in the war to reactively deploy minefields on supply roads\nwell behind enemy lines. Rocket-launching ISDM Zemledeliye remote minelaying\nsystems, each of which can scatter up to 600 anti-personnel mines in across a\nfootball-field sized area up to 9 miles away, appear to have substantially\nimpeded Ukraine\u2019s 2023 counteroffensive by re-mining corridors that had just\nbeen cleared of mines.\n\nBoevaya mashina (CCA-SA3)//Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe 50 rocket-launching barrels of an ISDM Zemledeliye remote mining system\n(mounted on 8x8 KamAZ truck) on display in 2022. The ability of these systems\nto create minefields behind enemy lines apparently proved effective in\ndisrupting Ukraine\u2019s 2023 counter offensive.\n\nWhile caltrops aren\u2019t as deadly as mines, Russian complaints offer compelling\nanecdotal evidence that they can cause extensive damage and delays to motor\ntransport\u2014particularly now that drones and artillery are more capable than\never at finishing off exposed, immobilized vehicles.\n\nS\u00e9bastien Roblin\n\nContributor\n\nS\u00e9bastien Roblin has written on the technical, historical, and political\naspects of international security and conflict for publications including\n19FortyFive, The National Interest, MSNBC, Forbes.com, Inside Unmanned Systems\nand War is Boring.
