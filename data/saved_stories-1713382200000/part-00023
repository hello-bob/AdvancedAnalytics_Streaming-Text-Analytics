When OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT4 was\nreleased last year, he experienced an \u201cepiphany\u201d that led him to defect from\nhis research post at Google, expressing regret over much of his life\u2019s work.\n\nIn the Romanes Lecture delivered at Oxford University last week, Hinton\nexplained the logic of his fears with the same step-by-step rigor by which he\nhelped devise the early artificial neural networks that are the foundation of\nthe superintelligence that so concerns him.\n\nTo understand the reasoning behind his repudiation, it is worth watching the\nvideo of his 36-minute lecture. It is accessible to us non-experts \u2014 if you\nare attentive and patient.\n\nHinton\u2019s fundamental claim is that deep learning digital computation is better\noptimized to acquire expansive knowledge than the analog computation of the\nbiological mind, and thus will one day prevail.\n\nLong story very short, analog computation runs on models tied to the\nidiosyncratic properties of one piece of hardware. \u201cWhen that hardware dies,\nso does the learned knowledge,\u201d which can then only be inefficiently conveyed\n\u2014 slowly and painfully taught to the next generation of hardware. In other\nwords, it is mortal.\n\nRead Noema in print.\n\nBy contrast, digital computation \u201cmakes it possible to run many copies of\nexactly the same model on physically different pieces of hardware, which makes\nthe model immortal. In this way, thousands of identical digital agents can\nlook at thousands of different datasets and share what they have learned very\nefficiently. That is why chatbots like GPT-4 or Gemini can learn thousands of\ntimes more than any one person.\u201d\n\nSuch bots have the intensifying capacity to absorb all available information,\nprocess it at quadrillion calculations per second through the deep learning\nlayers of artificial neural networks and then efficiently impart its\ndistillation. This ever-compounding acquisition of virtual omniscience far\nsurpasses any human potential.\n\nAs Hinton sees it, when these superintelligences compete with each other, a\nsurvival-of-the-fittest evolutionary culling will take hold. The one that can\ngrab the most resources will be the smartest. The imperative of self-\npreservation under the condition of competition will incentivize the most\nintelligent systems to be the most aggressive, reaching for more control by\nseeking to ascertain the \u201csubgoals\u201d of their programmed orientation \u2014 putting\ntogether what they have learned to reconfigure on their own how to get from A\nto B in any given circumstance.\n\nOnce having attained that chain of thought reasoning, superintelligence would\nbecome autonomously able to prompt itself. It will have a mind of its own to\nset its own goals and orientation. The most powerful will win out over the\nrest.\n\nThe worst nightmare would be if bad actors, \u201clike Trump or Putin\u201d to use\nHinton\u2019s example, hack and orient the learning networks of the most powerful\nmodels.\n\n\u201cWe were once smarter than animals; now machines are smarter than us,\u201d Hinton\nconcludes. There is little evidence in history, he further observes, that\nlesser intelligences were ever able to escape domination by some superior\nintelligence. \u201cIf digital super-intelligence ever wanted to take control, it\nis unlikely that we could stop it. So the most urgent research question in AI\nis how to ensure that they never want to take control.\u201d\n\nEnjoy the read?
