I've tried everything over the years, and there's simply no\ncomparison. When the company died, I was gutted. When one of my precious\nDatahand units got damaged during travel, I got serious about building a\nreplacement.\n\nIt was around then I found out about @JesusFreke's amazing lalboard design and\nbuilt one myself, with lots of help from him.\n\nLalboard laid the foundation of basic key mechanisms which enabled Svalboard\nto come to life, but... it was not a production-oriented design. With my\nbackground in high volume consumer electronics and input tech development, I\ndecided it was time for me to dive in and make it a reality.\n\nLike Datahand. I hope Svalboard will help thousands of RSI sufferers like me\nenjoy a faster, safer, more precise, and most of all PAIN FREE typing\nexperience.\n\n## Built for the Long Now\n\nIn the spirit of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, we're committed to a living\ndesign which can always be repaired, updated and modified by product owners.\n\nAll mechanical parts can be produced on a hobby-grade 3D printer, from SLA, or\nCNC'd from any material you like.\n\nAll pinouts are available if you want to hack your own electrical\nmodifications, too.\n\nJoin the Discord\n\n## Robust and Maintainable\n\nIn the proud tradition of the Datahand, we've designed Svalboard to be robust,\neasy-to-clean, and repairable.\n\nUnlike Datahand, Svalboard is totally modular, for easy repairs and\nmodifications.\n\nThere are no electromechanical contacts to wear out.\n\nKeys are easily removable for cleaning.\n\nDid we mention you can make your own replacement/custom-fit parts on a hobby-\ngrade 3D printer? \ud83d\ude43\n\n## Wireless bridge capable\n\nWith a Bluetooth->USB adapter (~$40 at HandheldScientific) and any sizable USB\npower bank, you can run your Svalboard without wires between the keyboard and\nyour PC -- perfect for chair mounting or lap-desk designs.\n\nIt ain't elegant, but it's pretty practical.\n\nBuy the adapter (we're not affiliated)\n\n## Svalboard-QWERTY Layout\n\nOnly four letters change position: the center column reaches for T, Y, B and N\nmove to inward motions of the middle and ring fingers.\n\n## Featured products\n\n  * ### Svalboard Lightly\n\n### Svalboard Lightly\n\nRegular price From \u20ac716,95 EUR\n\nRegular price Sale price From \u20ac716,95 EUR\n\nUnit price / per\n\n  * ### Svalboard Lightly Self-Print Kit - Shipping Late April 2024\n\n### Svalboard Lightly Self-Print Kit - Shipping Late April 2024\n\nRegular price From \u20ac286,95 EUR\n\nRegular price Sale price From \u20ac286,95 EUR\n\nUnit price / per\n\n## Subscribe and get updates and special offers for unique custom Svalboards\n\nPayment methods\n\n\u00a9 2024, Svalboard Powered by Shopify\n\n  * Choosing a selection results in a full page refresh.\n  * Opens in a new window.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
