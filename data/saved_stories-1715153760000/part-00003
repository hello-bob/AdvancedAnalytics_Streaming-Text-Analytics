Yet, despite its\npopularity for boosting alertness and physical performance, caffeine, a\npowerful stimulant, can lead to dependence and exacerbate health issues.\n\nA new study highlights the importance of moderation, noting caffeine\u2019s\nsimilarities to stronger stimulants and its effects on the central nervous\nsystem. With the FDA recommending a limit of 400 milligrams per day,\nunderstanding caffeine\u2019s impact is crucial for both consumers and providers of\ncaffeinated products.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. Economic Impact: The coffee industry employed 2.2 million people and generated over $100 billion in wages in 2022.\n  2. Health Implications: While caffeine can enhance focus and physical performance, excessive intake can induce anxiety, insomnia, and complicate existing health conditions.\n  3. Legal Concerns: The risks associated with high caffeine intake have led to severe health incidents and legal actions, such as the lawsuits faced by Panera Bread over their highly caffeinated drinks.\n\nSource: Texas A&M\n\nWhether it\u2019s brewing a cup of coffee at home, ordering a specialty $6 latte\nfrom a local coffee shop or cracking open a Red Bull on the way to the gym,\nthe consensus is clear: The prevalence of the caffeinated beverage industry\ncontinues to grow.\n\nAccording to the National Coffee Association\u2019s Coffee Impact Report, the\ncoffee industry employed 2.2 million people and generated more than $100\nbillion in wages in 2022.\n\nCaffeine\u2014most commonly found in and associated with coffee, black and green\nteas, energy drinks and some dietary supplements\u2014is ingested with the goals of\nincreasing energy levels and boosting alertness along with motivation.\n\nHowever, regularly ingesting high amounts of caffeine has the potential to\ndevelop into a dependence and can induce feelings of anxiety as well as\ninsomnia while also exacerbating some mental illness symptoms.\n\nBeing aware of personal limits and a drink\u2019s caffeine level are two simple but\neffective ways to reap the benefits of caffeinated drinks while avoiding the\nfeelings of jitteriness and anxiety that often accompany them. Credit:\nNeuroscience News\n\nDr. Sherecce Fields, a clinical psychologist and professor in the Department\nof Psychological and Brain Sciences at Texas A&M University, says it\u2019s\nimportant to remember that caffeine is classified as a stimulant drug and\nshould be ingested in moderation and with caution.\n\n\u201cCaffeine is in a similar class as drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine and\nbehaves in a way that increases activity in dopamine neurons,\u201d Fields said.\n\u201cAll of the things that are related to how it improves things like cognition\nand memory are related to its stimulant effects.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Library of Medicine, stimulant drugs function by\nincreasing the activity of the central nervous system. Specifically, they\nactivate neural pathways connecting the brain and the body, contributing to\nfeelings of euphoria and focus and creating a cognitive edge.\n\nAt the correct dosages, caffeine can provide benefits to athletes and students\nby respectively increasing muscle speed and improving levels of focus.\n\n\u201cCaffeine is very popular with athletes because it can increase things like\nmuscle speed, muscle efficiency and can reduce fatigue as it stimulates the\nperipheral nervous system to get up and get out,\u201d Fields said.\n\n\u201cA lot of individuals with undiagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD) will also use caffeine to help them focus because it acts in a\nsimilar way to some ADHD medications.\u201d\n\nDespite these benefits, caffeine is a substance that should be ingested and\nmonitored carefully, and should never exceed the daily amount of 400\nmilligrams, as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cFor individuals who consume quite a bit of caffeine, when they stop, they\nusually have increased anxiety or a depressed mood,\u201d Fields said.\n\n\u201cFor someone who is suffering from a mood disorder like major depressive\ndisorder or a generalized anxiety disorder, it can certainly exacerbate those\nfeelings.\u201d\n\nFields notes it becomes especially dangerous for individuals with underlying\nhealth issues like high blood pressure and inadequate heart health, as highly\ncaffeinated beverages consumed without a level of caution can cause health\ncomplications.\n\nThese instances can even make their way into a courtroom, as in the case of\nPanera Bread\u2019s three lawsuits surrounding their highly caffeinated \u201ccharged\nlemonades.\u201d These drinks contain more caffeine than a 12-ounce Red Bull and\n16-ounce Monster energy drink combined.\n\nAfter consuming multiple refills of the drinks, two individuals died, while a\nthird faced permanent health complications. Each had underlying health\nproblems that made them sensitive to caffeine.\n\nThe multifaceted question of whether Panera Bread should be held liable for\nthe deaths of these individuals is not easily answered. Fields emphasizes the\nimportance of being a good consumer of information and the ethicality of\naccurate advertising.\n\n\u201cAs a consumer, I try to encourage my students and my own son to be good\nconsumers of information,\u201d Fields said.\n\n\u201cIn Panera\u2019s instance, it is important to understand that 390 milligrams of\ncaffeine is pushing the limit, and if you have more than that, it can be quite\ndangerous, especially if you have hypertension or some other cardiovascular\ndisease.\u201d\n\nBeing aware of personal limits and a drink\u2019s caffeine level are two simple but\neffective ways to reap the benefits of caffeinated drinks while avoiding the\nfeelings of jitteriness and anxiety that often accompany them.\n\n\u201cSomebody drinking two to three cups of coffee a day exceeds the recommended\nmaximum amount, which can have detrimental effects on your fight-or-flight\nsystem, your heart and your digestion,\u201d Fields said.\n\n\u201cAt low doses, caffeine can improve behavior and focus, so the most important\nthing to consider is finding balance and having the correct dosage for your\nspecific needs.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that caffeine reactions differ significantly from person to\nperson and can provide both health benefits and detriments, depending on the\namount. So before ordering that third cup of coffee, remember that more\ndoesn\u2019t always mean better.\n\n## About this caffeine and neuroscience research news\n\nAuthor: Emily Chan Source: Texas A&M Contact: Emily Chan \u2013 Texas A&M Image:\nThe image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nTags\n\nanxietyattentionbrain researchCaffeineHealthinsomniamental\nhealthneurobiologyNeurosciencePsychologySleepTexas A&M\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
