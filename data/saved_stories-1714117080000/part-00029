These include ticketing\nof all commencement events taking place on May 8-11 and directing all campus\naccess through specific points of entry.\n\nWe are in the process of finalizing details, and all schedules, ticketing\nprocesses, and additional materials will be posted on our commencement website\nby Tuesday, April 30, 2024. Once posted, we will do our best to minimize\nchanges so as not to disrupt your planning.\n\nEvents and Schedules:\n\nAs in previous years, the university will be hosting dozens of commencement\nevents, including all the traditional individual school commencement\nceremonies where students cross the stage, have their names announced, are\nphotographed, and receive their diplomas. In keeping with tradition, we will\nbe hosting all doctoral hooding ceremonies, special celebrations, and\ndepartmental activities and receptions.\n\nWith the new safety measures in place this year, the time needed to process\nthe large number of guests coming to campus will increase substantially. As a\nresult, we will not be able to host the main stage ceremony that traditionally\nbrings 65,000 students, families, and friends to our campus all at the same\ntime and during a short window from 8:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.\n\nWe understand that this is disappointing; however, we are adding many new\nactivities and celebrations to make this commencement academically meaningful,\nmemorable, and uniquely USC, including places to gather with family, friends,\nfaculty, and staff, the celebratory releasing of the doves, and performances\nby the Trojan Marching Band.\n\nTicketing and Safety Measures:\n\n1\\. Tickets will be required to access campus and all commencement events\ntaking place on May 8-11, 2024. Graduating students will be able to reserve,\nfree of charge, tickets for themselves and up to eight named guests. Tickets\nwill not be transferrable. There will be an appeal process if more tickets are\nneeded. We will begin reserving tickets early next week.\n\n2\\. Prior to entering commencement events, we will screen people and bags,\nusing security measures similar to those for attending athletic events at the\nColiseum and before entering many other large venues.\n\n3\\. Please note, we will have a clear bag policy.\n\n4\\. You should allow more time \u2014 to park, go through security, enjoy campus,\nand get seated at the various ceremonies. Commencement ceremonies take place\nat different times and various locations on or adjacent to our campus. Guests\nand graduates will be able to plan their arrival times to meet their own\nneeds. There will be hospitality areas, a variety of places to sit, rest, and\nhydrate in the shade before and after your ceremony.\n\nConferring of Degrees:\n\nThe most important part of commencement is the presentation of degrees, which\nwill take place at our individual school ceremonies. For those who have never\nattended a graduation (like many students this year), we\u2019ve created a gallery\nof photos from ceremonies of previous years so you can see how joyful and\nspecial these are.\n\nFurther Information:\n\nFurther information, including detailed maps, parking instructions, ADA\naccommodations, public transportation, ticketing information, and our code of\nconduct and expectations, can be found at the 2024 Commencement website.\nDemonstration and free speech zone policies will be posted, as well, so\neveryone understands how we will ensure a safe and orderly commencement. This\nis a one-stop site that will be updated regularly.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and understanding as we make our arrangements for\na celebratory and significant experience for our 2024 Trojan graduates.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\n\nUniversity Park Campus Los Angeles, CA 90007\n\nCONTACT US\n\ncommunications@usc.edu\n\n  * University of Southern California\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Notice of Non-Discrimination\n  * Digital Accessibility\n\n", "frontpage": false}
