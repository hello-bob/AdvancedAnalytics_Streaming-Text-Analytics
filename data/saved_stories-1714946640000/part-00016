Maybe the\ncycle of mountains and valleys is important, socially?\u201d stood unanswered.\n\nI\u2019ve become ever-more-convinced over the last nearly-decade that boom-and-bust\ncycles are mandatory for a healthy economic environment.\n\nMost aspects of your life happen in boom-and-bust cycles (learning, muscle\nbuilding, relationships, and on and on).\n\nEspecially after watching the craziness of the covid19 responses over the last\nyear+, I believe I can say with 100% certainty that organizations like central\nbanks trying to drive the economy with monetary policy anf interest rate hi-\njinks is universally bad.\n\nMy economics professor years ago described the Fed\u2019s job as \u201coperating a bus\nby lying on the floor, looking at a mirror on the ceiling, watching out the\nback window \u2013 telling the driver to go \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 based on how far away\nfrom the double-yellow line you were 9 months ago\u201d.\n\nAl Van Derzee was a smart man.\n\nblih, commentary Tags:economics, gold\n\n## More Related Articles\n\nafter \u201cthe cloud\u201d commentary\n\nwhy i won\u2019t \u2013 can\u2019t \u2013 vote for obama commentary\n\nwho wants an \u201call-star team\u201d anyway? commentary\n\nmy tech predictions for 2015 commentary\n\nassume formlessness \u2013 law 48 \u2013 #48laws by robert greene books\n\nhealth care \u201creform\u201d? commentary\n\nJanuary 2024S| M| T| W| T| F| S  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6  \n7| 8| 9| 10| 11| 12| 13  \n14| 15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20  \n21| 22| 23| 24| 25| 26| 27  \n28| 29| 30| 31  \n  \nRSS Error: A feed could not be found at `https://paragraph.cf/feed`; the\nstatus code is `503` and content-type is `text/html; charset=iso-8859-1`\n\n### Books\n\n  * Debugging and Supporting Software Systems\n  * Storage Series\n\n### External\n\n  * Backblaze\n  * Cirkul\n  * Digital Ocean\n  * Fundrise\n  * Great Big Purple Sign\n  * Password Generator\n  * PayPal\n  * Tech News Channel on Telegram\n  * Vultr\n  * Wish List\n\n### Other Blogs\n\n  * Abiding in Hesed\n  * Chris Agocs\n  * Eric Hydrick\n  * Jay Loden\n  * Paragraph\n  * skh:tec\n  * Tech News Channel on Telegram\n  * Veritas Equitas\n\n### Profiles\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Server Fault\n  * Stack Overflow\n  * Super User\n  * Telegram\n  * Twitter\n\n### Resume\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Resume (PDF)\n\n### Services\n\n  * Datente\n  * IP check\n  * Password Generator\n  * Tech News Channel on Telegram\n\n### Support\n\n  * Backblaze\n  * Built Bar\n  * Cirkul\n  * Digital Ocean\n  * Donations\n  * Fundrise\n  * PayPal\n  * Robinhood\n  * Vultr\n  * Wish List\n\n35-questions 48laws adoption automation blog blogging books business career\ncentos cloud community development documentation email encryption facebook\ngoogle history how-to hpsa ifttt linux money networking politics prediction\nproxy review security social social-media splunk ssl startup storage sun-tzu\ntutorial twitter virtualization vmware wordpress work writing zombie\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 antipaucity.\n\nPowered by PressBook Green WordPress theme\n\n", "frontpage": false}
