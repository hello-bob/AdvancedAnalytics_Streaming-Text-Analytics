The process, however, is labor-intensive and expensive. The\n> emergence of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by GPT-4,\n> presents an unprecedented opportunity to revolutionize and automate the\n> intricate process of data annotation. While existing surveys have\n> extensively covered LLM architecture, training, and general applications,\n> this paper uniquely focuses on their specific utility for data annotation.\n> This survey contributes to three core aspects: LLM-Based Data Annotation,\n> Assessing LLM-generated Annotations, and Learning with LLM-generated\n> annotations. Furthermore, the paper includes an in-depth taxonomy of\n> methodologies employing LLMs for data annotation, a comprehensive review of\n> learning strategies for models incorporating LLM-generated annotations, and\n> a detailed discussion on primary challenges and limitations associated with\n> using LLMs for data annotation. As a key guide, this survey aims to direct\n> researchers and practitioners in exploring the potential of the latest LLMs\n> for data annotation, fostering future advancements in this critical domain.\n> We provide a comprehensive papers list at \\url{this https URL}.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2402.13446 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2402.13446v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.13446arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zhen Tan [view email] [v1] Wed, 21 Feb 2024 00:44:04 UTC (7,583 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Large Language Models for Data Annotation: A\nSurvey, by Zhen Tan and 9 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2402\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
