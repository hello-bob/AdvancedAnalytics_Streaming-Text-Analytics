You have a\nquestion to ask. Where do you go?\n\nProbably, it depends.\n\nIf you need to ask, \u201cHow long is the flight from New York to LA?\u201d, then Google\nwould do.\n\nIf you need to ask, \u201cHow to repair a broken dishwasher?\u201d then YouTube would be\ngreat.\n\nIf you need to ask, \u201cWhat are the top tools for product management?\u201d then\nChatGPT would handle that.\n\nBut what if your question falls outside of the mainstream? What if you\u2019re\nlooking for an underground rap song, a niche JS library, or an honest review\nof crypto wallets?\n\nThen you would probably chat with your friends. Or ask on some specialized\nforum. Or open Google and type in \u201c{keyword} reddit\u201d.\n\nYou would be looking for answers from humans. You would be looking for answers\nfrom the Niche Internet.\n\n##\n\nWhat\u2019s Niche Internet\n\nWhat\u2019s Niche Internet? Let\u2019s start with the Internet itself.\n\nWe can look at it as two networks connected with each other: (1) content\nnetwork that lets us read and react to content such as social media posts,\nblogs, and videos, (2) community network that lets us connect with people\nthrough chat, follows, and likes.\n\nOn the Mainstream Internet, the content is focused on subjects you might\ndiscuss at a family dinner, such as the economy, presidential elections, or\nthe Super Bowl. The community there consists of celebrities, sports figures,\nBig Tech CEOs, and normal people.\n\nNiche Internet, on the other hand, is focused on deep interest in one\nparticular subject. These smaller-scale communities can talk all day about\nrationality, mathematics, or geo investigations. Although the Niche Internet\ncreators might have some local fame, if you mention their (nick)name to your\nnormie friends, they\u2019d have no idea who these people are.\n\nNiche Internet has its own influencers\n\nI believe that - in the last few years - Niche Internet has faced significant\nproblems.\n\nOur digital space has been dominated by Big Tech, where Google, Facebook, and\nTwitter algorithms decide what content to surface and what content to hide.\n\nBig Tech leans into the mainstream content at the expense of the niche since\nthis is where they can make the most money. It means that niches have less\ndistribution, and it\u2019s hard for these small communities to reach new people.\n\nBut there\u2019s hope.\n\nI believe that - thanks to recent changes in tech & business models - the\nNiche internet can return stronger than ever.\n\nAnd just like Netscape\u2019s bundling and unbundling and Packy\u2019s centralization\nand decentralization trends don\u2019t repeat but rhyme, so does Mainstream & Niche\ndominance of the Internet\n\nSo, I\u2019d like to invite you to examine the past, present, and future of the\nInternet through this lens and see what the future might hold.\n\nLet\u2019s start from the beginning so we can understand how we got here.\n\n##\n\nRise of the Niche Internet\n\nIn the early days, the Internet was a very niche place. It was full of\nacademics, Department of Defense employees, and hardcore geeks.\n\nIf 80s Internet users wanted to find some content, they typically asked their\nfriends or strangers for advice (Do you remember sending emails with\ninteresting links and jokes, anon?). And if they wanted to find some people to\nchat with and maintain their digital friendships, they typically used Usenet &\nemail.\n\nLater on, after we got the world\u2019s first website, people could also \u201cbrowse\nthe web\u201d by reading websites and clicking links that took them to other,\nsometimes very obscure and niche websites.\n\nThe Niche Internet was growing, and people - via e-mails, Usenet, or personal\nwebsites - were natural brokers of the content.\n\n***\n\nThe years passed, but the Internet was still in its early stages. It also\nbecame more popular, as did interactive services such as IRC, forums, and web\nchats.\n\nThose tools made it easy to find people with similar interests, and instead of\nwriting electronic letters, we could have a more back-and-forth conversation.\n\nIRC, forums, and web chats were typically subject-oriented (cat lovers, PC\ngeeks, football fans) or location-oriented (NYC, US, Europe). That meant that,\nby joining a forum, people naturally segmented themselves into these niches,\nso it was easy to have a focused conversation.\n\nThese were also places where we exchanged interesting content to consume or\neven programs to test. The Internet was still pretty niche, and we still\nlearned about new content, primarily from people who were geeking out on a\nparticular subject.\n\n***\n\nBut the Internet grew, and we needed to find our way around it.\n\nPlay Video\n\nSo, two Stanford students started curating a list of the most interesting\nwebsites:\n\n> \u201cThere were no commercial search engines back in 1993. But a Stanford\n> student named David Filo compiled a list of his 200 favorite websites.\n>\n> His buddy Jerry Yang helped turn this into an online list. They called it\n> \u201cJerry\u2019s Guide to the Worldwide Web.\u201d Filo and Yang added new websites every\n> day to their list\u2014and classified them according to categories.\n>\n> This turned into Yahoo.\u201d\n\nYahoo main page in 1996\n\nIt has been a great place to discover interesting websites. And although we\nlearned about new websites from a service, not from individual users like in\nthe Usenet/chat/e-mail era, it still had a strong human touch and \u201cbrowsing\nthe web\u201d experience.\n\nFilo and Yang even included a \u201cSearch only in Forums\u201d option.\n\nYahoo page in 1996 - within four clicks from the main page, I could find niche\narchitecture forums\n\nBut as Yahoo grew and became the Internet\u2019s wunderkind, it needed more users.\n\nSo they did what all businesses do when they need to grow\u2014they turned to\nbigger markets and showed more mainstream content and websites to generate\nmore traffic and sell more ads.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Jerry sharing the coolest websites anymore. If you look at their\nwebsite from 2003, it also looks very different from the 1996 Niche Internet-\nYahoo.\n\nThe Mainstream Internet was on the rise.\n\nYahoo's main page in 2003. News, auctions, NBA. But still some space for niche\nstuff.\n\n***\n\nAnd then, as the Internet grew even bigger, a new way to find content gained\npopularity.\n\nFound by two other Stanford (PhD) students, Google allowed us to find websites\nfaster than ever. Instead of asking a friend or even Yahoo for a\nrecommendation, we started asking Google. If we did otherwise, it was even\nsometimes ridiculed (\u201cJust Google it!\u201d), and people\u2019s role in content\ndiscovery became even more limited than in the Yahoo era.\n\nSince the World Wide Web was much smaller and less SEO-optimized then, we\ncould use Google to find both mainstream and niche content. Niche, interest-\nbased communities were easier to discover and, as a consequence, got many new\nmembers.\n\nThere were even Yahoo-like Directories and Groups back then.\n\nGoogle website in 2003\n\nEarly 2000s Google was how I found most places I hung out online back then.\nThanks to its search I found the Jedi Knight II game forum to look for new\nStar Wars comic books and spent time on Wolfenstein-related IRC channels to\nlearn about the new metal songs.\n\nSo, although the websites were not picked by Yahoo employees and users but by\nGoogle\u2019s algorithm - it was pretty easy to find niches. The Mainstream\nInternet was growing, but the Niche Internet was doing fine.\n\n2003 Google even had Yahoo-like categories\n\n##\n\nMarginalization of the Niche Internet\n\nThen, social media entered the chat.\n\nMySpace was something between the old websites and the new ones.\n\nYou could customize the look and feel of your pages like on old, personal\nwebsites. And there were many conversations on forums and blogs, creating a\nnew, tight social network.\n\nMySpace forums in 2006\n\nBut if you look closely, there\u2019s a subtle difference here. MySpace didn\u2019t\npoint to external forums & blogs. They wanted to have all the content on their\nwebsite. And these tactics worked - their engagement was skyrocketing.\n\nAt some point, MySpace got so dominant that Google paid $900M to provide\nsearch results and ads, and some journalists started asking if MySpace\nmonopoly could ever be broken.\n\nAlthough MySpace was a much more centralized solution than a myriad of old-\nschool forums, it was still a pretty good way to discover interesting content\nfrom real people. Primarily because - for the first time ever - we had so many\npeople in one place.\n\nSoon after MySpace\u2019s peak, Facebook took over. Back then, their feed was also\na good source of content. Yes, sometimes my feed was focused on what my\nfriends had for lunch, but I could also discover tons of interesting stuff.\n\nAn obscure YouTube love song that my friend posted so that her crush \u201cjust get\nit.\u201d A niche blog post about the 2008 financial crisis that generated heated\ndebates. Or a DeviantArt gallery by my amateur photographer friend.\n\nSince my friends were there, it was pretty easy to find niche content - I\ncould just check the wall of a friend who was into a particular subject or DM\nthem.\n\nAlthough MySpace and Facebook started to gate content and centralize Internet\nengagement, the Niche Internet was doing fine.\n\nThis was primarily because these networks created a space for millions of\npeople to discuss things they found interesting and share links to articles,\nwebsites, and videos related to these subjects. Once again, people were\nbrokers of content, creating a counterbalance to algorithm-driven Google.\n\nUntil something changed.\n\n***\n\nSoon, social media executives started receiving memos from the investors. The\nmessage was simple: \u201cYou need to finally start making real money.\u201d\n\nSince their platforms earned money by distributing ads to their users, almost\nall social media decided to limit the reach of external links. The goal was\nsimple - make people stay longer in the app so they watch more ads, so social\nmedia would make more money.\n\nSo, if you posted your thoughts on Facebook instead of linking to your blog\npost, you reached more people. This is what some users started doing, and the\nera of \u201csocial media influencers\u201d went into full swing.\n\nThis move had a subtle but important consequence.\n\nWhen you think about all the previous eras - e-mail, IRC, Yahoo, Google - it\nwas all about helping you find some external content. Even early MySpace and\nFacebook were full of links.\n\nNow, these social networks have closed the gates and stopped being a good tool\nfor discovering external content. In the meantime, Google search results got\nmore populated by ads and SEO-optimized content. That meant that many niche\nwebsites, blogs, and forums couldn't be found as easily as before.\n\nAnd in this new era, people didn't explore the Internet the way the 80s & 90s\nusers did. 2010s users relied on Google and social media, which was like\ntaking a guided tour through a huge, wild Internet forest. They were only\nshown what the Big Tech algorithm guides wanted them to see, missing the\nvastness and diversity off the beaten path.\n\nIn other words, Niche Internet became marginalized. But there was one way to\nreclaim its spotlight.\n\n##\n\nLinks to the rescue\n\nOne lesson we learned from Yahoo, MySpace, and Facebook stories is that ad-\nbased business models have one thing in common. When companies relying on ads\nneed to grow, they look to bigger and more profitable markets. In other words,\nthey lean more into the mainstream.\n\nAnd that makes economic sense.\n\nConsumer brands with the biggest budgets, such as P&G, Mercedes, or Emirates\nAirlines, must reach millions of people to achieve their marketing goals. So,\nif a tech platform wants a share of this budget, it needs to provide access to\nmillions of people.\n\nAnd although niche ads can generate a lot of money - that\u2019s how podcasters\nmake a living - it\u2019s not enough for a $100B+ business (it's one of the reasons\nwhy Reddit\u2019s revenue is 150X smaller than Meta\u2019s).\n\nRelying on displaying ads to the mainstream population has a pretty\npredictable outcome. As we said before, when ads become the platform\u2019s primary\nsource of revenue, it needs users to stay on its platform to show them more\nads. That means it\u2019ll eventually have to penalize external links, just like\nmost major social platforms did before.\n\nWe said that penalizing links can make it harder for niche websites to get\ndiscovered, but it has much more far-fetched consequences.\n\nNiche communities - by definition - are looking for depth. Whether the niche\nis focused on fishing, IT security, or New York restaurants, people are\nlooking for specialized knowledge that can\u2019t be found on the first Google\npage.\n\nAnd niches often move fast. There is always a new fishing rod, new malware, or\na new small restaurant opening in NYC.\n\nIn other words, niche communities rely on people who have a deep understanding\nof the subject and stay up-to-date with these ever-changing domains. These\npeople are rare and are typically scattered across different social media,\nblogs, forums, and group chats.\n\nThe chances of getting them all on one platform are probably not much higher\nthan Google or Microsoft employing all the brightest engineers in the world.\nAs Bill Joy said: \u201cNo matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for\nsomeone else.\u201d\n\nIf we wanted to adapt Joy\u2019s law to social networks, we could say: \"No matter\nwhat platform you are, most of the smartest niche people don\u2019t publish there.\u201d\n\nThis means that to reach a satisfying depth of conversation, the niche\ncommunity can\u2019t rely only on content published on one platform, such as\nFacebook or Twitter. The community needs links. Links to the best tools,\nvideos, blogs, or websites covering a certain subject that can enrich the\nconversation and provide more depth.\n\nSo, if you run social media and you want to serve niches, you can\u2019t penalize\nlinks because the niches will eventually run away, looking for deeper\nconversation in a place where links are welcome.\n\nAnd there\u2019s one social platform that got it.\n\n##\n\nReturn of the Niche Internet\n\nWhen other social platforms got a memo about making more money through ads,\nthere was one rebellious enough not to sacrifice its links. It was geeky and\nsometimes even weird. And it was as close to Internet culture as it got. This\nplatform was Reddit.\n\nWhat made Reddit different from Facebook or Instagram was its long-tail\nstrategy, with thousands of niche subreddits.\n\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Distribution-of-the-number-of-\nsubscribers-of-subreddits-The-largest-subreddits-in-the_fig2_333085087\n\nReddit understood niches inside out and knew that penalizing links would be\nthe beginning of the end for them. So, they kept them intact, and many online\ncommunities migrated there.\n\nThey also remained the only major social network on which you don\u2019t need to\nlog in to read the content. It soon turned into a symbiotic relationship with\nGoogle, where we started adding \u201cReddit\u201d to our keywords to find niche\nanswers. And - although Reddit sells ads - they try to fund themselves with\nalternative sources such as Reddit Premium, Gold, or Collectibles.\n\nBut Reddit isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, and Niche Internet growth wasn't\nconfined to one platform. So, in that era, it felt as if Niche Internet plants\nstarted growing in all parts of the Internet forest.\n\nNiche content stormed podcasts, YouTube videos, group chats, and newsletters.\nSome STEM-oriented communities were growing on StackExchange, which welcomed\nworld-class scientists, including Nobel prize & Fields medal winners. Some\nculture-oriented communities were growing on Wikia (a.k.a. Fandom), where they\nlearned about books, movies, and video game lore.\n\nNew platforms also became more open to exploring business models that are not\nad-reliant. Partially thanks to Netflix, Substack, and Patreon, which taught\nconsumers that not all content on the Internet is free.\n\nIn addition, Substack revived the Niche Internet idea of people, not\nalgorithms, recommending content. And it worked\u2014some newsletters like Lenny\u2019s\nget 70% of their growth through recommendations from other writers.\n\nPatreon, on the other hand, gave birth to countless Slack, Telegram, and\nFacebook groups for niche-obsessed users who pay $10/month just to be a part\nof the community.\n\nAlso, our casual group chats on Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram became the\nnext incarnations of the mailing list. And since the chat and messaging apps\nare not feed-driven, they don\u2019t penalize link sharing.\n\nNiche communities are a way to satisfy many of our needs :)\n\nIn the same period, we got the podcast boom.\n\nFew people would read three-hour-long materials about gardening, martial arts,\nor parenting. But listening to a three-hour-long niche podcast? No problem, it\njust makes the workout or a traffic jam more pleasant. What's made the\npodcasts even better is that they rely on RSS feeds, which means the\ndistribution is less centralized.\n\nYouTube was also helping the cause. Although it is centralized like Facebook\nor Twitter, its wildly efficient discovery algorithms and generous ad revenue\nsplit with creators helped niche content creators reach the right audience.\n\nAll these things together made the tech community dive deep (again) into the\nideas of the creator economy and 1,000 true fans. I think it\u2019s fair to say\nthat the Niche Internet has returned to the public consciousness.\n\nThere's still one barrier in front of us, though.\n\n##\n\nBut how to find Niche Internet content\n\nYouTube, Reddit, and Substack are great for niches, but they are still\ncentralized platforms. This means that if they decide to bet more on the\nmainstream content, it can come at the expense of the niches. To make Niche\nInternet more independent, we need better discovery.\n\nHow do we discover niche content today? Typically, we ask a friend or an\nInternet stranger who\u2019d tell us, \u201cThis community/podcast/newsletter is really\ncool; you should check it out.\u201d\n\nAlthough this idea of people being manual brokers of content has a nice retro\nvibe, it doesn\u2019t feel optimal that our content discovery in 2024 works as if\nit were 1994.\n\nSo what could we do?\n\n1) The most battle-tested idea is link aggregators.\n\nHackerNews has been around for over 15 years, and it\u2019s still the prime source\nof tech-related news. Although there is some mainstream news there, you can\nalso find obscure blogs, niche GitHub repos, and eccentric websites.\n\nI believe that more niches should adopt this way of discovering interesting\ncontent. This idea is close to my heart because Kiwi - the project I\u2019ve been\nworking on with Tim for almost a year - is about aggregating links. We curate\ntop content and discussions in the same way HackerNews does, so we can keep\nthe discussion quality high, like on old-school forums.\n\nThe difference is that our product is decentralized, which means that if you\ndon't like our app, you can build an alternative app with your own moderation\ndesign and algorithm. And it can access all links, upvotes, and comments that\nwe display in our app, so you don't need to build the content & community from\nscratch.\n\nAt this point, the content is focused on crypto, but we plan to scale\nhorizontally and, in the future, cover other subjects in a subreddit-like\nmanner.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about it, here's a good link to check.\n\n2) The second idea I find interesting is boutique search engines.\n\nThese engines are focused on a particular niche. For example, we use DoorDash\nto find a good restaurant, Airbnb to find a good place to stay, and Behance to\nfind a good graphic designer. What makes these engines different from Google\nis that they combine search with curation, typically through likes and 5-star\nreviews.\n\nSo, the idea is to use the same concept but for different niches like\nprogramming, parenting, or gardening.\n\nOf course, the examples provided above are centralized in the sense that you\ncan\u2019t use Airbnb to find hotels on Booking. And these marketplaces make money\nby selling products and services, which might not be the perfect model for an\nopen search engine. But this is definitely an interesting idea to explore,\nespecially given the recent advancements in AI and Chatbots in general.\n\n3) The last idea is SaaS-based social media.\n\nI think it has the potential because of my old Facebook experience, which I\nrecalled before\u2014my feed was a source of different links from the niches my\nfriends were interested in.\n\nOne fast-growing project in this area is Farcaster, which uses Reddit-like\nchannels to segment people into niches. Since it charges users and not\nadvertisers, it doesn\u2019t penalize links, which means that some of these\nchannels are good sources of high-quality information.\n\nThere are also other projects, such as Mastodon, Nostr, and BlueSky, that are\neven more popular than Farcaster. From what I know, they don't use SaaS-based\npricing and rely on hobbyists and donations, but I have to admit I haven't\nchecked them in a while.\n\n***\n\nAll these three methods have their superpowers and limitations. Some of them\ncan also be combined (e.g., link aggregator & boutique search engine), and I\nthink we have just scratched the surface of what's possible.\n\nSo, generally speaking, the future of the Niche Internet is bright (if we do\nthe work to make it bright).\n\n##\n\nNiche Internet matters\n\nThis has been a longish post. We started by examining Internet history through\nthe lens of Mainstream and Niche.\n\nFor decades, these worlds grew harmoniously. Mainstream products, such as\nYahoo, Google, and early social media, supported the discoverability of niche\ncontent and communities. In the last few years, the Mainstream Internet has\nstarted growing at the expense of its Niche counterpart.\n\nSince most users learn new content and people via search or social media,\nGoogle, Meta, and Twitter have gained huge power over niche creators. As these\nplatforms relied on ads, they eventually had to limit the external links'\nreach, which decreased the potential of niche communities.\n\nHappily, we saw the renaissance of the Niche Internet, with Reddit, Substack,\nPatreon, and many others helping niche creators and communities blossom. One\nbig challenge is discoverability, which I believe can be solved via link\naggregators, boutique search engines, and SaaS-driven social media. There are\nalready some promising projects in these areas, and I think we are on the\nright track to reclaim the attention that was taken by Big Tech's algorithms.\n\nAnd I believe it's an important problem to solve.\n\nNiches are what make the world go round. Hardcore geeks and enthusiasts are\nthe ones who explore new ideas and move their domains forward. Eventually -\nonce their ideas reach mainstream - we all can reap the rewards of the new\ntechnologies, frameworks, and methods these people came up with.\n\nSo, let's keep pushing to give niche communities their own spaces that can be\neasily found by anyone who's interested. If we do it right, everyone gets to\nfind their tribe and share what they love, making the internet - and the world\n- a cooler place for all of us.\n\nThanks to Tim Daub & freeatnet for feedback on the early drafts of this text\n\nPS: If you'd like to chat about this post, I'd also happily discuss this with\nyou in the Kiwi comments.\n\nPS2: I'd also highly appreciate all likes and retweets of the Twitter thread\nversion of this post.\n\nPS3: If you'd like to dig into the Niche Internet lore, here are the articles\nand talks I recommend (in no particular order):\n\n1) \"Boutique search engines\" by Saria Zout\n\n2) \"What happened to my search engine\" by Honest Broker\n\n3) \"Why do news aggregator apps keep failing\" by Baekdal\n\n4) \"The human medium is the human message\" by Simon de la Rouviere\n\n5) \"The Balkanization & Babelification of the Internet\" by Ruby Justice Thelot\nand Rue Yi\n\n6) \"The tyranny of the marginal user\" by Ivan Vendrov\n\n7) \"Content Liquidity and Protocol Lock\" by rafa\n\n8)\"The Internet's distribution problem\" by Kyle Chayka\n\n9) \"Death of the follower\" by Jack Conte\n\nCollect this post to permanently own it.\n\nSubscribe to kanfa [by Mac Budkowski] and never miss a post.\n\n### What's your email?\n\nSubscribe to never miss a post.\n\nOver 100 subscribers\n\nNo thanks\n\nTwitter\n\nRSS\n\n\u00a9 2024 kanfa [by Mac Budkowski]\n\n### kanfa [by Mac Budkowski]\n\nPerspectives on web3 & startups\n\nNo thanks\n\n### kanfa [by Mac Budkowski]\n\nPerspectives on web3 & startups\n\nNo thanks\n\n", "frontpage": false}
