(reported by Hraban Luyat, thanks to Nicolas Martyanoff)\n  * minor incompatible change: when looking for its core file, the system checks the validity of whatever is pointed to by /proc/self/exe, and assesses argv[0] if /proc/self/exe is invalid. (thanks to Philipp Marek)\n  * minor incompatible change: the system no longer provides type names on the standard (CL) symbols ARRAY-RANK, ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE, PATHNAME-HOST, PATHNAME-TYPE, PATHNAME-DIRECTORY, FLOAT-RADIX or FLOAT-DIGITS. (#2045559)\n  * platform support:\n\n    * the mark-region parallel garbage collector can be enabled on arm64. (Thanks to Hayley Patton)\n    * fix build on modern FreeBSDs.

Users may define methods on this generic function.\n  * enhancement: external formats for unibyte encodings and utf-8 now support newline variants.\n  * enhancement: character decoding and encoding errors signalled by stream or octet functions now provide a USE-VALUE restart for handlers to provide replacement input or output.\n  * enhancement: READ-SEQUENCE and WRITE-SEQUENCE support user-defined sequences; the default implementation proceeds element-by-element, reading or writing single bytes or characters to or from the stream as appropriate.\n  * bug fix: OCTETS-TO-STRING using unibyte external formats with unallocated codepoints (e.g. iso-8859-3) correctly signal or use replacements rather than taking bits from the address of NIL and converting those bits to a character.\n  * bug fix: FILE-STRING-LENGTH now returns NIL if the input datum is not encodable in the stream's external format.\n  * bug fix: table-based multibyte external formats (EUC-JP, Shift-JIS, GBK) now honour a replacement character (in the external format or through restarts) when encoding to octets.\n  * bug fix: converting from octets using the UCS-2, UCS-4 and UTF-32 external formats no longer reads past the end of an octet array with a non-integral number of two- or four-byte units.\n  * bug fix: converting from octets using the UCS-2, UCS-4, UTF-16 or UTF-32 external formats now returns a simple string, as required by the type declaration of OCTETS-TO-STRING.\n  * bug fix: providing an invalid external format argument to OPEN or WITH-OPEN-FILE (or the internal MAKE-FD-STREAM) no longer leaks a file descriptor.\n  * bug fix: SB-ROTATE-BYTE recognizes out-of-relevant-range BYTE specifications for integers before attempting to cons up enormous bignums for masking and shifting. (#2042937)\n  * bug fix: fix type derivation on compiling SB-ROTATE-BYTE forms with non-zero POSITION in the byte specifier.

(#2042452)\n  * optimization: external formats with :REPLACEMENT no longer bind handlers for coding errors around conversion functions, and so should cons less and be faster.\n  * optimization: when the :EXTERNAL-FORMAT argument to STRING-TO-OCTETS or OCTETS-TO-STRING is a compile-time constant, the external format is resolved at load time rather than on each call.\n  * optimization: the compiler is able to constrain the types of inputs to some functions given a derived or asserted type of the function's return value.\n  * optimization: the compiler performs fewer redundant type checks in ASSOC, GETF and similar functions.\n\n## New in version 2.3.10, 2023-10-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: The compiler now allows stack allocating vectors of any size on all safety levels, not just those which it can prove are of sub-page sizes. It can do this because it now inserts code to check for stack overflow explicitly on higher safety levels.\n  * enhancements to the disassembler:\n\n    * on arm64, x86-64, DISASSEMBLE annotates references to static symbols.\n  * bug fix: calls to generic functions now detect erroneous keywords (in the sense of CLHS 7.6.5) passed as arguments even when auxiliary methods are applicable.\n  * bug fix: the standard method on SB-MOP:COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-METHOD no longer inserts calls to implementation-defined local macros. (reported by Daniel Kochma\u0144ski)\n  * bug fix: compiler error from state-machine-like LABELS forms in some circumstances. (#2037318)\n  * bug fix: fix compile-time error in constant-folding RATIONAL on literal float infinities.

Rodriguez)\n  * bug fix: inability to dump a literal displaced array containing copies of its displacement target. (#2038233, reported by James Kalenius)\n  * bug fix: compiler error in LOGBITP type derivation. (#2038241)\n  * bug fix: compiler error in AREF type derivation. (#2038659)\n  * bug fix: compiler internal consistency failure in overflow type checks. (#2038736)\n  * bug fix: work around an infinite loop in type simplification by not providing such types from the compiler. (#2038980, reported by Richard Holcombe)\n  * bug fix: spurious run-time argument count errors from generic function calls on arm64. (#2039006, reported by fiddlerwoaroof)\n  * bug fix: errors in SCALE-FLOAT on floating-point infinities. (#2039613)\n  * bug fix: ROOM is slightly more robust to incompletely-initialized instances at the point of running ROOM. (Reported by Andreas Franke)\n  * bug fix: finalizers saved through SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE and subsequently executed do not trigger memory faults. (Reported by Bohong Huang)\n  * optimization: improvements to type derivation for ISQRT, INTEGER-LENGTH, LOGCOUNT, LOG, DENOMINATOR.\n\n## New in version 2.3.9, 2023-09-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: stack allocation via DYNAMIC-EXTENT now applies to all values that a variable can take on (for example via SETQ), not just the initial binding. This permits for example building complex or recursive structures on the stack more easily via iteration. See the updated manual entry for more details.\n  * minor incompatible change: some interfaces in the SB-POSIX contrib module adhere to the spec that a NULL result from the C library is an error if and only if errno was altered by the call. SYSCALL-ERROR will be signaled if so.\n  * enhancement: the SB-POSIX contrib module provides DO-PASSWDS and DO-GROUPS to allow users to iterate over password and group databases safely.\n  * platform support:\n\n    * support for Darwin on x86 and PowerPC has been restored. (#2033287, thanks to Kirill A. Korinsky, Sergey Fedorov and barracuda156)\n  * bug fix: miscompilation due to erroneous type derivation in the presence of multiplication of fixnums by ratios. (#2033695, reported by Patrick Dussud)\n  * bug fix: compiler error when compiling signed- and unsigned 64-bit type checks in some cases. (#2033997, reported by Eric Smith)\n  * bug fix: compiler error when the :INITIAL-CONTENTS argument to MAKE-ARRAY is a constant non-sequence. (#2037328)\n  * bug fix: compiler error when constant-folding sequence functions with :TEST or :KEY functions erroring on the given sequence.

(#1883745)\n\n## New in version 2.0.5, 2020-05-31\n\nBack to top\n\n  * platform support:\n\n    * experimental support for ARM32 and ARM64 on OpenBSD\n    * better musl libc support. (#1768368, thanks to Eric Timmons)\n    * more correct use of futexes on 64-bit Linux. (#1876825, reported by Ilya Perminov)\n    * restore building on current Solaris. (#1881393, thanks to Shawn Ellis)\n  * enhancement: CMUCL-style START-BLOCK and END-BLOCK declarations are now supported for block compiling forms at a sub-file granularity.\n  * enhancement: IPv6 support in sb-bsd-sockets is enabled on Windows.\n  * minor change: *compile-print* now makes it more clear what block compilation is actually doing. The default output is now slightly more verbose as a result.\n  * bug fix: number keys in EQUALP hash tables are correctly hashed. (#1878653, reported by Syll)\n  * bug fix: EQness is better preserved given partial sharing of list contents in the file compiler. (#1583753, reported by Denis Budyak)\n  * bug fix: the peephole pass neglected to preserve jump table labels.

(#1865336, reported by il71)\n  * bug fix: sb-introspect's function-lambda-arglist is better at extracting default values of nested macro arguments. (#1876194)\n  * bug fix: RESTART-BIND's body is an implicit progn, and so does not accept declarations.

Unlike other ports, its backend is entirely shared with 64-bit RISC-V.\n    * native threads are now supported on RISC-V.\n    * fix and add some x86-64 vector instructions. (reported by Shubhamkar Ayare)\n    * improve pointer representation on ppc64 for low-level performance improvement.\n    * threads are more stable on big-endian ppc64\n  * enhancement: forward-referenced type tests can now be open-coded by using block compilation. The result is that mutually referential defstructs are now efficiently compiled in block compilation mode, superseding a lighter mechanism that worked in fewer contexts. However, that lighter mechanism has been removed, so for now, users who want to efficiently compile mutually referential defstructs must explicitly opt-in using block compilation.\n  * bug fix: defstructs with empty initforms in the sbcl source are now explicitly intiialized with NIL, as that is undefined behavior under ANSI. This helps cross compilation hosts which do not implicitly initialize empty initform slots to NIL.

It has been documented in a new section of the manual entitled \"Advanced Compiler Use and Efficiency Hints\". In particular, users of block compilation will find a large speedup for numerical code, as functions which call or return floating point values will keep everything unboxed.\n  * bug fix: in CHANGE-CLASS, handle non-standard slot-value-using-class for :INSTANCE and :CLASS slots better. (reported by Shinmera on #sbcl)\n  * bug fix: REMHASH in an EQUAL or EQUALP hash-table works correctly on a key for which EQUAL (respectively EQUALP) is reduced to EQ. (#1865094)\n  * bug fix: do not emit a warning for DEFCLASS slots with mismatched :TYPE and :INITFORM when the class has a non-standard metaclass.\n  * bug fix: DISASSEMBLE on SPARC is less likely to spuriously annotate code sequences as error traps.\n\n## New in version 2.0.1, 2020-01-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: some symbols have been removed from *FEATURES* based on a determination of which should be impermissible to examine via #+ and #- reader macros in user-written code.\n  * optimization: DEFSTRUCT copiers including COPY-STRUCTURE are able to stack-allocate the result when declared dynamic-extent.\n  * bug fix: loop analysis code more robust. In particular, loop nesting depth is computed more accurately, improving the register allocation around loops.\n\n## New in version 2.0.0, 2019-12-29\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: heap relocation now works on Windows. Since this feature now works on all platforms, it is enabled unconditionally and the :RELOCATABLE-HEAP symbol no longer appears on *FEATURES* in any builds. (Thanks to Lu\u00eds Borges de Oliveira)\n  * enhancement: malformed type specifiers and occurrences of deprecated types in :TYPE initargs of DEFCLASS and DEFINE-CONDITION slot specifications are detected and result in compile-time errors and warnings respectively.\n  * enhancement: parallel contrib building, controlled by SBCL_MAKE_JOBS=-jX the same as for the C runtime.\n  * bug fix: add a walker template for WITH-SOURCE-FORM.\n  * bug fix: start the summary of a compilation unit on a fresh line. (Thanks to Zach Beane)\n  * bug fix: on Windows, PARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING produces an absolute directory when parsing a bare drive name and :AS-DIRECTORY is specified. (Thanks to Lu\u00eds Borges de Oliveira)\n  * bug fix: on RISCV, the runtime is linked with libz if the core compression feature is requested. (Thanks to Andreas Schwab)\n  * bug fix: ADJOIN using an EQL test and a KEY function only transforms into an EQ test if the key function returns values for which EQ and EQL are guaranteed to be the same.\n  * optimizations:\n\n    * the instruction sequence for multiple-value calls is more efficient on x86-64.\n    * the direction flag is now unused on x86 and x86-64 when handling an unknown number of return values. (Thanks to Fanael Linithien)\n    * the x86-64 backend is better able to use memory operands for arithmetic operations.\n    * compilation of TYPECASE to a jump table is enabled when all the types being tested are frozen.\n    * compilation of CASE and ECASE into a jump table has been implemented on 32- and 64-bit powerpc platforms.\n    * the implementation of Unicode normalization has been sped up.\n    * pretty-printing dispatch on conses is faster, particularly with the standard pretty-print dispatch table. Deeply-nested forms should also pretty-print faster.\n\n## New in version 1.5.9, 2019-11-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * platform support:\n\n    * a message intended to be more helpful will be displayed for an mmap failure on OpenBSD.\n    * the soft-float ABI on ARM32 is better supported, in particular in returning double floats from calls into C.\n  * optimizations:\n\n    * CASE and ECASE with symbols as keys may be optimized into a vector lookup if all result forms are quoted or self-evaluating objects.\n    * CASE and ECASE can be optimized into a jump table on the x86[-64] backends with arbitrary result forms provided that the clause keys are either all fixnums, all characters, or all symbols.\n    * a number of forms are converted to use CASE in circumstances where that makes sense, including calls to POSITION, MEMQ and MEMBER, and TYPECASE where the types are MEMBER/EQL types.\n    * POSITION of a variable symbol in a constant sequence of symbols is converted to CASE and thence to a jump table.\n    * TYPECASE of a variable where the clauses are member types is converted to CASE and thence to a jump table.\n    * a number of slow instructions are no longer used on x86 and x86-64 machines.

(#1799719)\n  * bug fix: DESCRIBE on functions not named by extended function designators no longer signals a type error.

(#309068)\n  * bug fix: pathnames with a directory component of the form (:absolute {:up,:wild,:wild-inferiors}) no longer fail to unparse. (#1738775)\n  * bug fix: more reliable signal handling on macOS.\n\n## New in version 1.4.2, 2017-11-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: SB-EXT:QUIT is no longer marked as deprecated and behaves like SB-EXT:EXIT.\n  * enhancement: ASDF updated to 3.3.1. The ASDF release is dedicated to the late Elias Pipping who put enormous amounts of work into it despite his terminal illness. Thank you and rest in peace. (#1681201)\n  * enhancement: alien routines compiled with '-fsanitize=thread' and/or '-fsanitize=memory' cause fewer false positives in error reporting.\n  * optimization: fewer instances of consing float constants at runtime.\n  * bug fix: a number of compiler bugs detected by Paul F. Dietz' randomized tester. (#1731503, #1730699, #1723993, #1730434, #1661911, #1729639, #1729471, #1728692)\n  * bug fix: better errors from NAMESTRING and friends on pathnames with no namestrings. (#792154)\n  * bug fix: EQUAL and EQUALP compiler transforms were too confident in deriving a result. (#1732277, #1732225)\n  * bug fix: FILL sometimes returned the underlying data vector rather than the given array. (#1732553)\n  * bug fix: SEARCH returned the wrong answer in some cases. (#1732952)\n  * bug fix: the type (COMPLEX INTEGER) behaves more as specified by Function TYPEP, which has stronger constraints than System Class COMPLEX. (Reported by Eric Marsden, #1733400)\n\n## New in version 1.4.1, 2017-10-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * optimization: faster foreign callbacks.\n  * enhancement: complex arrays can be stack allocated.\n  * enhancement: PROCESS-KILL now exists on win32 and PROCESS-PID actually returns the PID.\n  * optimization: the register allocation method used by the compiler when optimizing for speed is now faster for functions with large bodies.\n  * bug fix: SB-INTROSPECT:ALLOCATION-INFORMATION works on big-endian CPUs (fixes #490490 for real rather than by disabling a test)\n  * bug fix: code objects and bignums of large enough size to be placed on GC pages without any other object no longer cause accidental copying during garbage collection. (gencgc only)\n  * bug fix: sb-fasteval failure with 0-argument lambdas (#1722715)\n  * bug fix: RUN-PROGRAM doesn't leak handles on win32 and PROCESS-CLOSE doesn't crash. (#1724472)\n\n## New in version 1.4.0, 2017-09-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: DESTRUCTURING-BIND treats non-toplevel () as nested empty pattern. This seems to be what the standard mandates, so conforming code should not be affected.\n  * ehancement: (GC :GEN 7) with gencgc will zero-fill dead pseudo-static objects so that they do not spuriously cause reachability of objects that would have been otherwise dead.\n  * enhancement: PROCESS-STATUS now tracks stopped and continued processes properly (also fixes #1624941, based on patch by Elias Pipping).\n  * bug fix: INSPECT handles errors signaled while printing slot values. (#454682)\n  * bug fix: DESCRIBE works on classes like it used to.\n  * bug fix: *LOAD-PATHNAME* and *LOAD-TRUENAME* are bound to pathnames when processing a sysinit or userinit file\n  * bug fix: save-lisp-and-die is able to collect more garbage on non-x86oid gencgc targets.\n  * bug fix: fixed out-of-bounds array read in optimized POSITION on bit-vectors\n  * bug fix: signal emulation respects the 128-byte stack red zone on x86-64 macOS.\n\n## New in version 1.3.21, 2017-08-31\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: the CLOBBER-IT restart for defstruct redefintion has been removed after a 15 year deprecation cycle. Use the new name, RECKLESSLY-CONTINUE. Note also that this restart is hidden if deemed unsafe due to altered placement of untagged slots in the structure.\n  * enhancement: the assignment of -DSBCL_PREFIX= in src/runtime/GNUmakefile can be removed as a local patch, which results in an sbcl executable that finds its core file relative to itself by looking in \"../lib/sbcl\".\n  * enhancement: backends using the generational GC are able to relocate dynamic space anywhere the operating system places it. This feature can be disabled by removing :relocatable-heap from the build configuration. Not supported on Windows.\n  * enhancement: DEFMETHOD no longer signals IMPLICIT-GENERIC-FUNCTION-WARNING.\n  * enhancement: better type conflict detection for high order functions, e.g. (find x \"123\" :test #'=)\n  * enhancement: the tabular output of ROOM is aligned dynamically, preventing misaligned tables for larger sizes or counts.\n  * enhancement: ROOM reports on immobile space if applicable.\n  * optimization: optimized external-format routines.\n  * bug fix: SB-INTROSPECT:ALLOCATION-INFORMATION returns :IMMOBILE instead of :FOREIGN for objects in immobile space.\n  * bug fix: dotted lists in special forms and function call forms signal an appropriate error\n  * bug fix: EQUALP hash tables with pathname keys now ignore internal slots. (#1712944, reported by Jason Miller)\n\n## New in version 1.3.20, 2017-07-31\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: DEF{GENERIC,METHOD} no longer accept some illegal lambda lists such as (defgeneric bar (foo &key foo)) or (defgeneric baz (t)) that were accepted before.\n  * optimization: a valueless &AUX binding in a BOA constructor does not force all slots reads in safe code to perform a full type check.\n  * optimization: ATOMIC-PUSH and ATOMIC-POP generate better code\n  * bug fix: the low-level debugger would erroneously print - or not print as the case may be - \"(bad-address)\" for some objects depending whether the --dynamic-space-size argument was used at Lisp startup\n  * bug fix: a DEFCONSTANT with a non non-eql-comparable object as the value could cause miscompilation if that constant appeared as the default expression for an &OPTIONAL binding\n  * bug fix: generic function lambda lists are now checked for repeated and otherwise illegal entries. (#1704114)\n  * bug fix: setting gencgc_verbose = 1 could cause deadlock in fprintf() depending on the platform's stdio implementation. The relevant code has been changed to use snprintf() and write() instead.\n\n## New in version 1.3.19, 2017-06-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: specialized arrays can be printed readably without using *read-eval*\n  * enhancement: SB-DEBUG:PRINT-BACKTRACE truncates huge string arguments. The full string remains available for inspection via (SB-DEBUG:ARG).\n  * bug fix: backtracing from several threads at once could fail\n  * bug fix: floating-point infinities could not be used as keys in EQUALP hash tables. (#1696274)\n  * bug fix: random sb-fasteval failures. (#1642708)\n  * bug fix: align the stack in callback wrappers to defend against C compiler over-aggressive use of SIMD. (#1697528)\n  * bug fix: don't try to find the class when reporting that a class does not exist for a primitive type. (#1697226)\n\n## New in version 1.3.18, 2017-05-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: existing values of CFLAGS, ASFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and LINKFLAGS will be incorporated into C compiler invocations when building from source.\n  * minor incompatible change: the result of WRITE-TO-STRING may be a BASE-STRING if all characters written are of type BASE-CHAR.\n  * minor incompatible change: the broadcast stream with no output streams is a singleton object. That object satisfies OPEN-STREAM-P regardless of how many times CLOSE is invoked on it.\n  * enhancement: x86[-64] backends contain an experimental feature which aids in demonstrating reachability of any object starting from a tenured object or a thread stack by producing a proof as a sequence of pointers to follow. The file \"tests/traceroot.test.sh\" contains an example usage.\n  * enhancement: if the alien symbol \"gc_coalesce_string_literals\" is set to 1 prior to SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE, then similar string constants loaded from different fasl files may be collapsed to one object. If the variable is set to 2, then additionally strings which are STRING= in code resulting from COMPILE can be coalesced. For instance, two functions returning the literal string \"HI\" might return EQ strings after collapsing, which may be undesired in a particular use. The flag pertains to gencgc only.\n  * enhancement: SXHASH values on pathnames are better distributed\n  * bug fix: MAKE-PATHNAME removes empty strings as components of a directory, as is permitted: \"Whenever a pathname is constructed the components may be canonicalized if appropriate.\"\n  * optimization: various printer and FORMAT performance enhancements.\n  * bug fix: GET-FOREGROUND no longer fails in case all other interactive threads exit (#1682671, reported by Syll)\n  * bug fix: RELEASE-FOREGROUND always removes the current thread from the list of interactive threads. (#1682867, reported by Syll)\n\n## New in version 1.3.17, 2017-04-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: memory overhead from the garbage collector's metadata is reduced on 64-bit architectures; no change for 32-bit.\n  * enhancement: further garbage collector speedups affecting pinned objects on conservative backends, and simple-vectors.\n  * enhancement: on Linux a custom handler for SIGSEGV can be called for page faults outside of dynamic space by changing the C symbol \"sbcl_fallback_sigsegv_handler\".\n  * bug fix: sb-cover does not lose source positions for AND/OR/COND.\n  * bug fix: random disassembler failures. (#1527931)\n  * The bundled sb-md5 contrib has been updated to release 2.0.4 which is licensed under Creative Commons CC0 per author's statement https://github.com/pmai/md5/commit/fd134e71b71a10ab78905833a7cb9d4d6817c589 (Refer to NEWS and COPYING in the contrib/sb-md5 subdirectory)\n\n## New in version 1.3.16, 2017-03-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * optimization: various small tweaks give around 5% faster garbage collection\n  * bug fix: better detection of when an impossible code path does not need a warning. (#1668619)\n  * bug fix: stronger attempts to disable position-independent executable building. (#1668986, patch from Mark Wright)\n  * bug fix: OPEN :IF-EXISTS NIL signalled a condition on Windows. (#1674437, reported by Jan Idzikowski)\n\n## New in version 1.3.15, 2017-02-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: the reader will when feasible create new symbols using a BASE-STRING for the print name. Additionally, string literals can favor the base-string type if desired, though the default is to always return UTF-32 strings for compatibility. A preference for base-string does not disable reading Unicode. The choice is controlled via (SETF READTABLE-BASE-CHAR-PREFERENCE). If Unicode was disabled at build time, this setting does nothing.\n  * enhancement: SBCL generates more debug information by default.\n  * enhancement: type errors provide context information, such as which variable is being bound, which slot of which structure is being set.\n  * enhancement: if #+immobile-symbols is in build-time *FEATURES* (not enabled by default), then symbols will never be moved in memory except by SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE. Immobility has helpful implications for code generation as well as interaction with foreign routines. This feature can only be enabled if #+immobile-space is enabled.\n  * enhancement: undefined function errors can be restarted on x86-64, to either retry calling the function again or call a user supplied function.\n  * enhancement: sb-ext:restrict-compiler-policy accepts an upper bound in addition to a lower bound.\n  * enhancement: #+immobile-code improves the speed of function calling. Some delay may be noticed when redefining an existing function from a saved core file however.\n  * defaults change: sb-ext:*disassemble-annotate* default to NIL, due to its poor reliability.\n  * new feature: SB-LINKABLE-RUNTIME, allowing linking with extra object files to help with delivery of executables. (Thanks to Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau)\n  * bug fix: data race in GENTEMP fixed - it can no longer return the same interned symbol to multiple threads if called concurrently\n  * bug fix: interrupting LOADing of FASLs does not leave functions without source locations. (#540276)\n  * bug fix: DYNAMIC-EXTENT-declared results of NOTINLINE local functions were treated as if they were actually stack allocated (#1659964)\n  * bug fix: correctly handle the case of a non-local exit within a function terminating the extent of dynamic-extent, dynamic-bound variables in the presence of multiple-values (#1655011)\n  * bug fix: handling of SB-SYS:WITH-PINNED-OBJECTS in the interpreters (both sb-eval and sb-fasteval) now actually pins objects on gencgc.\n  * bug fix: AVX registers are preserved during exceptions on x86-64 macOS.\n  * bug fix: (directory \"SOMETHING/*/**/MORE\") is no longer equivalent to (directory \"SOMETHING/**/MORE\")\n  * bug fix: better console IO on Windows (#1660906)\n\n## New in version 1.3.14, 2017-01-22\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: the SB-PCL walker no longer recognizes macros expanding into a DECLARE expression. This is not a language change, since ANSI forbids such usage (X3J13 issue DECLARE-MACROS:FLUSH).\n  * enhancement: for several macros such as MULTIPLE-VALUE-{BIND,SETQ}, COND, DO{,*,LIST}, {RESTART,HANDLER}-{BIND,CASE}, *CASE, conditions signaled during macroexpansion point to the form that caused the problem more accurately.\n  * enhancement: the \"--noinform\" command-line option inhibits output from save-lisp-and-die in addition to removing the startup banner.\n  * bug fix: PROCESS-KILL failed to return errno if the system call failed\n  * optimization: slightly more comprehensive treatment of the keyword arguments to MAKE-ARRAY in compiler transformations.\n\n## New in version 1.3.13, 2016-12-31\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: SET triggers package locks on undefined variables. (#1645152)\n  * enhancement: new Windows specific option to run-program, :escape-arguments (#1503496)\n  * enhancement: recompiling a MAKE-INSTANCE form with an initarg :INITARG CONSTANT where CONSTANT names a constant variable picks up the new value of CONSTANT in case it has been redefined. (#1644944)\n  * optimization: faster TYPEP on undefined at compile-time types and upcoming class definitions. (#1082967)\n  * optimization: memory consumption of each STANDARD-OBJECT instance is reduced by 2 words if the compact-instance-header feature is enabled.\n  * optimization: CONDITION instances are quicker to allocate.\n  * optimization: unoptimized calls to FILL on specialized vectors are now just as fast as T vectors.\n  * bug fix: get-timezone returns corret DST on 64-bit Windows. (#1641058)\n  * bug fix: cross reference information in fasls is no longer incompatible between different cores (#1648186)\n\n## New in version 1.3.12, 2016-11-29\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: on x86-64, compiled functions loaded from fasl files can not be moved, but can be freed, by GC. Additionally, COMPILE will produce immobile code if SB-C::*COMPILE-TO-MEMORY-SPACE* is set to :IMMOBILE. (Caution: the flag is experimental and subject to change.) The benefits are better physical separation of code from data, and potentially easier examination of live images by external tools.\n  * enhancement: the docstring for SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE has been amended to say that the :ROOT-STRUCTURES parameter is not meaningless on gencgc, depending on the platform.\n  * bug fix: calling a named function (e.g. a DEFUN) concurrently with redefining that same function could lead to execution of random bytes.\n  * bug fix: yes-or-no-p accepts formatter functions (#1639490)\n  * bug fix: better handling of exceptions on macOS.\n\n## New in version 1.3.11, 2016-10-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: SB-EXT:*INTEXP-MAXIMUM-EXPONENT* is removed.\n  * enhancement: TRACE ... :REPORT {TRACE,NIL} now work as advertised in the documentation string (based on patch by Patrick Stein)\n  * enhancement: support unboxed signed-word structure slots on x86, x86-64 and ARM64. (#377616)\n  * optimization: faster logical bit-array operations on multidimensional arrays.\n  * optimization: better GC performance in the presence of many threads. (patch by Ilya Perminov, #1339924)\n  * optimization: multiple-value-call is optimized with multiple argument forms, not just one. (#753803)\n  * bug fix: MAKE-ALIEN-STRING returns the number of allocated bytes as a second value as advertised (reported by Johann 'Myrkraverk' Oskarsson)\n  * bug fix: when TO-READTABLE is supplied to COPY-READTABLE, it will contain only the macros in FROM-READTABLE and no others. (#1631506)\n  * enhancement: gencgc has been modified for x86-64 on Linux and macOS to a support mark-and-sweep as well as the traditional copying strategy. It is conceivable that some applications might be adversely affected. Please see ':immobile-space' in 'base-target-features.lisp-expr' for further details, and possible reasons to disable this feature.\n  * enhancement: x86-64 supports shrinking the fixed overhead in a structure from 2 words to 1 word, reducing memory consumption in applications which create many small structures.\n\n## New in version 1.3.10, 2016-09-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: more compact low-level error signaling code\n  * enhancement: more compact encoding of cross-reference information\n  * optimization: faster out of line fixnum-float comparisons.\n  * optimization: filling a known simple-vector with a constant value is about as fast in unoptimized code as in code compiled with (SPEED 3), and the x86-64 implementation is able to use SSE instructions.\n  * bug fix: correctly handle the case of a non-local exit within a function terminating the extent of dynamic-extent functions and variables in the presence of multiple-values (#1563127)\n  * bug fix: restore builds on the latest OSX with the latest Xcode (#1470996)\n\n## New in version 1.3.9, 2016-08-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: NAMESTRING prefers to return a BASE-STRING instead of (ARRAY CHARACTER (*)) when possible.\n  * enhancement: cached make-instance/allocate-instance constructors can now get garbage collected.\n  * optimization: better performance for some unoptimized operations on complex numbers.\n  * bug fix: using the options :LOCAL-NICKNAMES and :LOCK in the same DEFPACKAGE form no longer signals a bogus error\n\n## New in version 1.3.8, 2016-07-31\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: the system now understands that the CONDITION type is disjoint with many other system types.\n  * minor incompatible change: argument types in condition report functions are now declared (in combination with the above change, this can result in early detection of erroneous code).\n  * enhancement: simple arrays of any rank can be stack-allocated on platforms supporting stack allocation of vectors.\n  * optimization: improved type derivation for FIND, POSITION, COUNT, SEARCH, MISMATCH and other array and sequence functions.\n  * optimization: ALLOCATE-INSTANCE is now as fast as MAKE-INSTANCE.\n  * optimization: more efficient CHANGE-CLASS.\n  * bug fix: versions of getresuid() and getresgid() in SB-POSIX no longer cause memory faults, and should work properly (#1603806, reported by Kieran Grant)\n  * bug fix: handle ENOENT from getprotobyname() (#1596043, reported by Stephen Hassard)\n\n## New in version 1.3.7, 2016-06-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * bug fix: preserve the name of the destructive function for the destroyed constant and important result warnings, even when declared NOTINLINE.\n  * optimization: faster operations on list-sets.\n  * optimization: better type derivation of set functions.

It can be nil, as is permissible by the standard.\n  * enhancement: ported to ARM64 Linux.\n  * enhancement: a new interpreter is included which has many benefits over sb-eval. It is disabled by default. See src/interpreter/README for instructions to enable it, and further details.\n  * bug fix: calling COMPILE when SB-EXT:*EVALUATOR-MODE* was :INTERPRET would fail to perform \"normal semantic processing such as macro expansion\" as stipulated by X3J13 issue LOAD-TIME-EVAL.\n  * bug fix: SB-UNICODE:CONFUSABLE-P no longer treats \"<\" and the empty string as confusable. (#1504739)\n  * bug fix: (ASSERT (COMPUTE-IT ...)) would expand incorrectly if COMPUTE-IT was a local macro that shadowed a global function.\n  * bug fix: SB-POSIX:CFSETISPEED and SB-POSIX:CFSETOSPEED now work properly on platforms that use only the minimum specified set of fields in struct termios (verified on Linux, still known not to work on FreeBSD and NetBSD, very probably others).

(#1489590)\n  * bug fix: MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM enforces that :ELEMENT-TYPE is a subtype of CHARACTER.\n  * bug fix: an EQL method specializer no longer causes garbage retention if there are no extant methods using the specializer. (#492851)\n\n## New in version 1.2.15, 2015-08-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * new feature: DEPRECATION declaration for functions, variables and types causes {EARLY,LATE,FINAL}-DEPRECATION-WARNING to be signaled when subject of the declaration is used. Integrated with DESCRIBE, DOCUMENTATION and SB-CLTL2:{VARIABLE,FUNCTION}-INFORMATION. Documented in the \"Deprecation\" section of the manual.\n  * enhancement: ASDF updated to 3.1.5. (#1476867)\n  * enhancement: definitions within PROGN get proper source locations when compiled (needs latest Slime to take advantage of this). (#1473147)\n  * enhancement: source locations for DEFCLASS slots now point directly to the slot definitions, not the whole DEFCLASS form.\n  * bug fix: better source location in the presence of quoted forms. (#1370561)\n  * bug fix: better source locations inside backqoute. (#1361502)\n  * bug fix: HANDLER-BIND requires that the handler-function be a function designator at the time of binding establishment. (#1480679)\n  * bug fix: inlined functions surrounded by nested macrolets are properly inlined. (#309123)\n\n## New in version 1.2.14, 2015-07-29\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: The name of a compiled anonymous lambda as returned by the third value of FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION can have a lambda-list-like list following the introductory LAMBDA that is not in general a syntactically valid lambda list. Specifically, it won't retain default values, supplied-p variables, or &KEY or &AUX bindings.\n  * enhancement: DESTRUCTURING-BIND has been totally reimplemented from scratch to address a handful of performance and correctness issues. Some minor behavioral differences exist regarding order of evaluation of default forms for unsupplied &OPTIONAL and &KEY arguments when nested destructuring patterns are involved. (#707556, #707573, #707578, #708051)\n  * enhancement: DEFCONSTANT and DEFSTRUCT respect package locks. (#1186238, #1036716)\n  * enhancement: sb-unicode:normalize-string has a new optional argument, FILTER, a callback which controls which decomposed characters are collected. Useful for stripping away diacritics more efficiently.\n  * bug fix: (TYPE-OF ARRAY) for a non-simple array is subject to change after a call of ADJUST-ARRAY. (#1333731)\n  * bug fix: Dynamic-extent allocation with a loop between allocating a value and the start of its environment no longer discards the allocated data when the loop is taken. (#1472785)\n  * bug fix: Variable-reference elimination no longer generates incorrect code under certain circumstances. (#1446891)\n  * bug fix: variables with EQL types are no longer treated as constants by VOPs, which caused problems with closures being allocated for such variables, but they remained unused. (#1390149)\n  * bug fix: Windows installer generates registry key name correctly. (#1476447)\n\n## New in version 1.2.13, 2015-06-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: on success, TRY-SEMAPHORE and WAIT-ON-SEMAPHORE return the new count\n  * enhancement: WAIT-ON-SEMAPHORE accepts a decrement parameter\n  * enhancement: JOIN-THREAD allows distinguishing timeout vs. abort in all situations\n  * enhancement: On Windows DBG_PRINTEXCEPTION_C is handled and its message is printed. (#1437947)\n  * bug-fix: TRUENAME works properly on broken symlinks presented as directories. (#1400003)\n  * bug fix: Inlined DPB and DEPOSIT-FIELD don't interfere with left-to-right order of argument evaluation. (#1458190)\n  * bug fix: (SETF (LDB (BYTE 1 2 JUNK) X) 0) is rightly rejected.\n  * bug fix: DEFSETF lambda lists should not permit argument destructuring.\n  * bug fix: calls to (SETF SLOT-VALUE) on a missing slot would in certain situations incorrectly return the result of a SLOT-MISSING method instead of always returning the new value. (#1460381)\n  * bug fix: a DEFMACRO occurring not at toplevel and capturing parts of its lexical environment (thus being a closure) caused expressions involving the macro name to cause corruption in the pretty-printer due to faulty introspection of the lambda list of a closure.\n  * bug fix: out of line MAP/MAP-INTO check that the results produced by the function are of the matching sequence type. (#1459581)\n  * bug fix: pretty-printing of '(LET `((,X ,Y)) :B) is handled correctly.\n\n## New in version 1.2.12, 2015-05-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: the SB-C::*POLICY* variable is no longer a list. Code which manipulated it as such (including but not limited to non-bundled releases of ASDF) will need to be revised.\n  * enhancement: The input stream for COMPILE-FILE implements STREAM-LINE-COLUMN.\n  * enhancement: EVAL errors that occur by way of LOAD report the starting line and column number of the erring toplevel form. (#565247)\n  * optimization: better MAP and MAP-INTO on known vector result types.\n  * bug fix: Read/modify/write macros accessing a place which is a composition of CAR+CDR operations, such as (SHIFTF (CADR X) (ELT V 0)), do not access subforms more than once. (#1450968)\n  * bug fix: short form of DEFSETF no longer allows trailing junk.\n  * bug fix: DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO respects the provisions of CLHS 5.1.3 regarding argument evaluation order. (#1452539)\n  * bug fix: POP works as specified in CLHS if the setter for its argument has a side-effect on the existing CAR value. (#1454021)\n  * bug fix: Reading \"#()\" with a positive numeric argument signals a reader error. As specified, reading \"#1()\" has undefined consequences, so correct portable code should be indifferent to this. (#1252100)\n  * bug fix: Malformed reader conditionals such as \"(#-no-such-feature)\" and \"(#+sbcl)\" no longer parse as NIL. (#1454400)\n\n## New in version 1.2.11, 2015-04-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: SET-PPRINT-DISPATCH will warn when given an expression in which any part is unrecognizable as a legal type-specifier. The dispatch table will be altered, but the new entry is disabled. Subsequent type-defining forms will cause pprint-dispatch tables to re-examine whether any disabled entries should be enabled. (#1429520)\n  * enhancement: Loading code containing calls to a deprecated function will, under most circumstances, signal warnings similar to compiling such code. The usual caveat holds about not detecting calls through a computed name, as in (funcall (intern \"DEPRECATED-FUN\" \"SB-EXT\")).\n  * enhancement: (SB-EXT:COMPILE-FILE-LINE) is a new macro that expands to a constant (VALUES integer integer) indicating the source line/column from which it was read, intended for logging Lisp runtime errors in a style similar to that afforded by the C preprocessor __LINE__ macro. Similarly (SB-EXT:COMPILE-FILE-POSITION) returns a position in characters.\n  * enhancement: improved source locations for VOPs, alien types and declarations.\n  * bug fix: functions in :FINAL deprecation have the correct docstring. No visible change, as no such functions presently exist. (#1439151)\n  * bug fix: (SETF (FDEFINITION this) (FDEFINITION OTHER)) signals an error if OTHER names either a macro or special-operator. (#1439921)\n\n## New in version 1.2.10, 2015-03-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: all SOCKINT::WIN32-* functions have been deprecated with EARLY deprecation state\n  * minor incompatible change: performing introspection via the system-internal SB-INT:INFO function could expose that :TYPE :TRANSLATOR is not necessarily a function, as it always was before. (Affects swank-fancy-inspector)\n  * enhancement: The value of SXHASH on bit-vectors of length equal to the word size now depends on the vector's contents instead of being constant; its value on bit-vectors of length divisible by the word size now depends also on the contents of the vector's last word.\n  * bug-fix: sb-bsd-sockets on win32 uses proper C function declarations. (#1426667)\n  * bug fix: A new dead code elimination phase removes dead code loops that confuse stack analysis. (#1255782, #308914)\n  * bug fix: A toplevel form which was simple enough to bypass the main compiler in COMPILE-FILE, and which contained an empty SETQ or PROGN would produce an invalid fasl file. (#1427050)\n  * bug fix: The compiler no longer signals an internal error when encountering invalid FUNCTION forms like (function 1)\n  * bug fix: express proper dependencies in the ASDF contrib, to support systems where make runs in parallel. (#1434768; thanks to Nikhil Benesch)\n\n## New in version 1.2.9, 2015-02-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change and bug fix: unboxed numeric constants on x86oids are arranged in memory differently, and the disassembler does not show them separately in DISASSEMBLE, but does if DISASSEMBLE-CODE-COMPONENT is used. (#1421987)\n  * optimization: The compiler's treatment of type specifiers makes it slightly faster and more memory-efficient. Portable code should be indifferent to this change, however, users of SB-INTROSPECT:FUNCTION-TYPE might notice that (MEMBER T NIL) and (MEMBER NIL T) are both internally collapsed to the former, so that the latter can never be obtained as part of an FTYPE.\n  * optimization: a TYPEP call in which the second argument is not a QUOTE form but nevertheless recognized as a compile-time constant might open-code the test. One scenario for this involves backquote, such as (TYPEP x `(my-type ,some-arg)). Code which relied upon deferring until runtime should declare (NOTINLINE TYPEP). [Due to the sematic constraints of DEFTYPE etc in in CLHS 3.2.2.3, code requiring delayed evaluation could be unportable though.]\n  * enhancement: unused variables at the top-level are now reported. (#492200)\n  * bug fix: DEFCLASS handles cyclic {super,meta}class relations better (#1418883)\n  * bug fix: compiler no longer signals an error when compiling certain function calls. (#1416704, #404441, #1417822, #1234919)\n  * bug fix: compiler doesn't stumble on a LOGIOR transform. (#1389433)\n  * bug fix: more robust debugger and backtraces. (#1413850, #1099500, #1412881, #945261, #1419205, #1409402)\n  * bug fix: files larger than 4GB can now be compiled.\n  * bug fix: x86 truncated results from 64-bit foreign functions to 32 bits.\n  * bug fix: file-position didn't work on large files on win32. (#1271545)\n  * bug fix: callbacks from foreign threads can work without enabling sb-safepoint.\n  * bug fix: sb-introspect:function-lambda-list works properly on interpeted macros. (#1387404)\n  * bug fix: ADJUST-ARRAY properly handles non-adjustable arrays. (#886418)\n  * bug fix: compiler no longer fails to dump a multidimensional array constant involving a circular reference to itself\n  * bug fix: conditional and nested DX allocation no longer confuse the compiler in STACK analysis. (#1044465)\n  * bug fix: sb-rotate-byte constant folding bug fixed. (#1423682)\n\n## New in version 1.2.8, 2015-01-31\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: better error and warning messages. (#1314767, #736383)\n  * enhancement: backtrace for invalid argument count produces the exact supplied arguments including the extra ones, on x86, x86-64 and ARM.\n  * enhancement: a STYLE-WARNING is signaled for DEFSTRUCT accessors which are used before the structure is defined; similarly for the predicate.\n  * optimization: FORMAT NIL with only ~a and string arguments is transformed into CONCATENATE.\n  * optimization: POSITION and FIND when inlined into code that is compiled with qualities of safety < 2 and speed > space will no longer signal an error on circular lists, but will potentially loop forever if given no :END constraint. As was always the case, calls that are not inlined are safe regardless of lexical policy.\n  * bug fix: CLOS methods compiled with (OPTIMIZE (DEBUG 0)) no longer cause debugger failure when printing a backtrace\n  * bug fix: more resilience to deleted code. (#1308328, #1390544)\n  * bug fix: the CLHS example of MAKE-LOAD-FORM involving TREE-WITH-PARENT did not work, and now it does.\n\n## New in version 1.2.7, 2014-12-31\n\nBack to top\n\n  * optimization: returning constant values refers to preboxed constants more reliably. (#1398785)\n  * enhancement: a STYLE-WARNING is produced if a compiler-macro is defined for a function after at least one ordinary (not inlined) call to that function was compiled, indicating a likely compilation order problem. Likewise a warning ensues if a call is compiled to a function that is subsequently proclaimed INLINE.\n  * enhancement: always lose() when something goes wrong while saving a core (instead of just printing an error on stderr in some situations).\n  * enhancement: frames in the debugger are now restartable by default.\n  * bug fix: restore error handling on Windows x86.\n  * bug fix: MAKE-SEQUENCE detects type errors in its :INITIAL-ELEMENT at compile-time when possible. (#330299)\n  * bug fix: parsing of malformed type specifiers no longer results in a memory-fault-error.\n  * bug fix: LOOP properly destructures nested lists in WITH.\n  * bug fix: MACROEXPANDing the redefinition of an alien structure type no longer signals the wrong error.\n  * bug fix: PROGV doesn't get confused by forced DEBUG 3 (#1405456).\n\n## New in version 1.2.6, 2014-11-29\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: SERVE-EVENTS uses the poll() system call in lieu of select() if the OS has the former. Previously poll() was used only if waiting on exactly one file descriptor.\n  * enhancement: efficiency of access to untagged structure slots is improved on x86-64, and the order of slots in memory is exactly as specified by defstruct, simplifying use of structures as arguments to foreign calls.\n  * bug fix: SB-DEBUG:ARG now works in all TRACE options which evaluate forms. (#1357826)\n  * bug fix: GC memory corruption during internal memory handling.\n  * bug fix: duplicate effective-slot-definition objects as compared by EQ on name could be present in CLASS-SLOTS of a class whose metaclass was structure-class or condition-class. (#1049423)\n  * bug fix: HANDLER-BIND with empty bindings works again; regression in 1.2.5. (#1388707)\n  * bug fix: ATOMIC-INCF works on structure slots in interpreted code. (#1381867)\n  * bug fix: MAKE-ARRAY properly handles character types like (eql #\\a) and (member #\\a #\\c). (#1392068)\n  * bug fix: READ sometimes accidentally preserved a whitespace character after a token when it should not have. (#327790)\n\n## New in version 1.2.5, 2014-10-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: sb-bsd-sockets now has basic support for IPv6\n  * enhancement: An sb-unicode package has been added, containing many functions related to handling Unicode text\n  * enhancement: The reader now normalizes symbols to Normalization Form KC (NFKC). This behavior can be disabled with SB-EXT:READTABLE-NORMALIZATION\n  * enhancement: a style-warning is signaled if OPTIMIZE declarations multiply specify a quality with differing values. (#310267)\n  * bug fix: conservatively pointed to pages wipe out unused dwords so that they cannot act as false roots in turn.\n  * bug fix: the walker's handling of lexical variable and symbol-macro bindings is improved (#375326, #1368305)\n  * bug fix: HANDLER-{BIND,CASE} no longer drop into ldb when a clause contains an undefined condition type; regression in 1.1.19 (#1378939)\n  * bug fix: in interpreted code, inequality predicates did not type-check arguments that weren't examined, and a 1-argument use of MIN or MAX accepted a complex number. (#1373702)\n  * bug fix: APROPOS and APROPOS-LIST handle inherited symbols correctly. (#1364413, thanks to Zach Beane)\n\n## New in version 1.2.4, 2014-09-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: the sequence functions MAP, CONCATENATE and MERGE now call the new generic functions SEQUENCE:MAP, SEQUENCE:CONCATENATE and SEQUENCE:MERGE respectively when the specified result type designates an extended sequence.\n  * bug fix: Wrong binding order of supplied-p parameters in macro lambda lists. (#721135)\n  * bug fix: VALIDATE-SUPERCLASS returns T when the superclass is the universal superclass (#1332983)\n  * bug fix: reading an uninterned symbol whose print name has the syntax of an integer signals an error. (#310062)\n  * bug fix: the walker is less likely to be confused when walking LET* forms with special bindings and use of those bindings and others of the same name.\n  * bug fix: a rare bug affecting 32-bit platforms resulting in a fatal condition with the message \"Globaldb rehash failure\" has been fixed.\n\n## New in version 1.2.3, 2014-08-29\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: DOCUMENTATION works on instances of FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS\n  * enhancement: ASSERT reports arguments of calls to lexical functions in additional to global functions.\n  * enhancement: ASDF updated to 3.1.3\n  * enhancement: UIOP can be loaded without ASDF.\n  * bug fix: some methods on CHANGE-CLASS did not finalize the new class before accessing its class-precedence list.\n  * bug fix: CHANGE-CLASS no longer fails on unbound slots in the source object.\n  * bug fix: CHANGE-CLASS signals an appropriate error when the destination class is a FORWARD-REFERENCED-CLASS.\n  * bug fix: CHANGE-CLASS no longer signals bogus TYPE-ERRORs for slots for which initargs have been supplied.\n  * bug fix: saving cores on ARM was broken since the introduction of GENCGC. (#1349795)\n  * bug fix: macroexpanding a backquoted expression involving \",.\" outside of the compiler failed. (#1354623)\n\n## New in version 1.2.2, 2014-07-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: the #\\\\` (\"backquote\") reader macro was reimplemented to support robust pretty-printing. Reading a form involving #\\\\` produces an invocation of the QUASIQUOTE ordinary macro which may contain subforms that are not lists. Code that unportably attempts operations on un-evaluated forms resulting therefrom, e.g. (SUBST a b (read-from-string \"`(x (,y))\")) might generate incorrect results and/or errors.\n  * enhancement: support for GNU/kFreeBSD x86.\n  * enhancement: ATOMIC-INCF and ATOMIC-DECF can operate on (CAR x), (CDR x) and DEFGLOBAL variables of type fixnum.\n  * enhancement: arithmetic constant reduction is now performed on defconstant constants too. (#1337069).\n  * bug fix: certain ftype proclamations containing &optional t &rest t no longer cause subsequent definitions to signal bogus style-warnings.\n  * bug fix: #\\Bell and #\\Bel now read to different characters.

(#673625)\n  * enhancement: SB-EXT:DEFINE-LOAD-TIME-GLOBAL. (#1253688)\n  * enhancement: Loading fasls with symbols from an undefined package includes the name of the symbol in the error message.\n  * bug fix: problems when redefining classes and doing TYPEP on classes concurrently.

(#1276282)\n  * bug fix: pathnames with :back in their directory component are succeffully resolved.\n  * bug fix: the deterministic profiler now uses ENCAPSULATE functionality to wrap functions around. (#309086)\n\n## New in version 1.1.15, 2014-01-29\n\nBack to top\n\n  * new feature: the iterative spilling/coloring register allocator developed by Alexandra Barchunova during Google Summer of Code 2013 is now merged in. By default, it only activates for functions that optimize with (speed 3) and (> speed compilation-speed), but setting sb-regalloc:*register-allocation-method* to :iterative forces its execution. The previous behaviour can be obtained by instead setting that variable to :greedy. Thanks again to Google for their support, and, more crucially, to Alexandra Barchunova for her hard work.\n  * optimization: make-array with known element-type and unknown dimensions is much faster.\n  * optimization: make-array with unknown element-type is faster as well. (#1004501)\n  * enhancement: sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die on Windows now accepts :application-type argument, which can be :console or :gui. :gui allows having GUI applications without an automatically appearing console window.\n  * enhancement: reduced conservativism on GENCGC platforms: conservative roots must be valid-looking tagged pointers or point within a code object, not merely point to within the allocated part of a page, in order to pin a page.\n  * enhancement: support for \"Mac Roman\" external format.\n  * enhancement: encapsulation of named generic functions now happens without altering the identity of the function bound to the name.\n  * bug fix: Windows applications without the console window no longer misbehave. (patch by Wilfredo Velazquez, #1256034).\n  * bug fix: modular arithmetic optimizations do not stumble on dead branches with bad constants. (reported by Douglas Katzman)\n  * bug fix: CLISP can be used again as a cross-compilation host. (Thanks to Vasily Postnicov, #1261451)\n  * bug fix: run-program crashed with :directory nil.

(#985904)\n  * enhancement: errors during compiler-macro expansion no longer cause runtime errors, only a compile-time warning, otherwise behaving as if the compiler macro had declined to expand.\n  * optimization: On x86-64, code alignment of block headers is done with multi-byte NOPs now instead of repetitions of the single-byte NOP.\n  * optimization: MAP-INTO is substantially faster when the target sequence is of unknown type; mapping into lists is no longer O(N^2). (#1001043, thanks to James M. Lawrence)\n  * optimization: the compiler no longer heap-conses to check exits in cases where the exit function is dynamic extent, or when it can prove the exit function cannot escape. (#1002534)\n  * optimization: SB-SEQUENCE:DOSEQUENCE is faster on vectors of unknown element type, and vectors that aren't SIMPLE-ARRAYs.\n  * optimization: CL:SORT and CL:STABLE-SORT are more efficient in execution speed (around 1/3 the time in some cases), and a little better in terms of comparison calls. (Thanks to Takeru Ohta)\n  * bug fix: On SPARC, a limitation on the number of code constants emittable by the compiler has been lifted, allowing certain long functions to compiled and assembled which had previously been unsupported; fixes cl-bench on this ISA (#1008996).\n  * bug fix: potential for infinite recursion during compilation of CLOS slot typechecks when dependency graph had loops. (#1001799)\n  * bug fix: error forms reported with some program-errors were not escaped properly.\n  * bug fix: functions from EVAL are now on more equal footing with functions from COMPILE. (#1000783, #851170, #922408)\n  * bug fix: ENSURE-GENERIC-METHOD-COMBINATION accepts method combination objects as its :METHOD-COMBINATION argument, not just lists designating method combinations.

(Previously some values could be about 0.1 % more probable than others in the worst case.) (#309467)\n    * RANDOM on large integer arguments is generally faster and conses less than before; this is visible for fixnums above a length of about 24 bits, but extremely so for bignums: the old implementation used time and space quadratical in the size of the argument there, the new one is linear.\n  * enhancement: redesigned protocol for quitting SBCL. SB-EXT:EXIT is the new main entry point, SB-EXT:QUIT is deprecated.\n  * enhancement: additions to the SB-THREAD API: RETURN-FROM-THREAD, ABORT-THREAD, MAIN-THREAD-P, and MAIN-THREAD.\n  * enhancement: FASL loading no longer grabs the world-lock.\n  * enhancement: GENCGC reclaims space more aggressively when objects being allocated are a large fraction of the total available heap space.

(#924276)\n  * bug fix: ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST now works when *default-pathname-defaults* contains NAME or TYPE components.\n  * bug fix: PPRINT couldn't print improper lists with CARs being some symbols from CL package, e.g. (loop . 10).\n  * bug fix: run-program with existent or non-existent files for :output or :input when :if-output-exists or :if-input-does-not-exist are NIL properly returns NIL instead of signalling an obscure error.\n  * bug fix: fix miscompilation of some logand forms with large constant arguments.

(#975528)\n  * bug fix: copy-tree caused stack exhaustion on long linear lists, and now it's also slightly faster. (#998926)\n  * bug fix: better error messages for malformed declarations. (#1000239)\n  * bug fix: define-condition didn't return the name of the defined condition.\n  * documentation:\n\n    * improved docstrings: REPLACE (#965592)\n\n## New in version 1.0.56, 2012-04-12\n\nBack to top\n\n  * bug fix: fix copy-structure.

(Mainly useful for building 32-bit SBCL's on x86-64 hosts, not full-blows cross-compilation.)\n  * enhancement: extended package prefix syntax <pkgname>::<form-in-package> which allows specifying name of the default interning package for the whole form.\n  * enhancement: when *READ-EVAL* is true, arrays with element type other than T can be printed readably using #.-based syntax. (Thanks to Robert Brown)\n  * enhancement: MAKE-ALIEN signals a storage-condition instead of returning a null alien when malloc() fails. (#891268)\n  * enhancement: SB-EXT:PRINT-UNREADABLY restart for PRINT-NOT-READABLE conditions can be conveniently accessed through function with the same name, analogously to CONTINUE.\n  * enhancement: SB-EXT:*SUPPRESS-PRINT-ERRORS* can be used to suppress errors from the printer by type, causing an error marker to be printed instead. (Thanks to Attila Lendvai)\n  * enhancement: BACKTRACE and DESCRIBE now bind *PRINT-CIRCLE* to T, and generally behave better when errors occur during printing.\n  * enhancement: the test runner now takes a --report-skipped-tests argument to report the individual tests skipped as well as the number of skipped tests.\n  * enhancement: undefined functions now appear in backtraces as (\"undefined function\") instead of (\"bogus stack frame\") on x86oids.\n  * enhancement: detected deadlocks no longer cause stderr to be spammed, and deadlock errors are reported in an easier-to-decipher manner.\n  * enhancement: DESCRIBE on type designators reports the expansion in more cases.\n  * enhancement: SBCL now provides either an explicit :BIG-ENDIAN or :LITTLE-ENDIAN in *FEATURES*, instead of :BIG-ENDIAN being implied by lack of the :LITTLE-ENDIAN feature. (Thanks to Lu\u00eds Oliveira, #901661)\n  * enhancement: better disassembly of segment-prefixes on x86 and other instruction prefixes (e.g. LOCK) on x86 and x86-64.\n  * optimization: FIND and POSITION on bit-vectors are orders of magnitude faster (assuming KEY and TEST are not used, or are sufficiently trivial.)\n  * optimization: SUBSEQ on vectors of unknown element type is substantially faster.

Now a single deadlock is reported exactly once.\n  * bug fix: interval-arithmetic division during type derivation did not account for signed zeros.\n  * bug fix: compiler error when typechecking a call to a function with non-constant keyword arguments.\n  * bug fix: misoptimization of TRUNCATE causing erratic behaviour.\n  * bug fix: condition slot accessors no longer cause undefined function style-warnings when used in the :REPORT clause of the DEFINE-CONDITION form that defines them.

Default is megabytes as before.\n    * on GENCGC targets, the default dynamic space size is now 512Mb for 32-bit systems, and 1Gb for 64-bit systems. (OpenBSD/x86-64 is the only exception, defaulting to mere 444Mb to fit under default ulimits.) The new defaults are in place to prevent hitting swap on low-end systems. Use build-time option --dynamic-space-size to build an SBCL with another default, or the runtime option to adjust the size at startup: a good size is at most equal to the amount of physical memory the system has.\n    * on GENCGC targets, nursery and generation sizes now default to 5% of dynamic-space size.\n    * on GENCGC targets, SB-KERNEL:MAKE-LISP-OBJ no longer categorically refuses to create SIMPLE-FUN objects.\n    * on 64-bit GENCGC targets, setting the nursery size above 4Gb now works.

(Thanks to Lutz Euler, #894498)\n  * bug fix: on 64-bit targets, atomic-incf/aref does index computation correctly, even on wide-fixnum builds. (#887220)\n  * bug fix: (DIRECTORY \"foo/*/*.*\") did not follow symlinks in foo/ that resolved to directories.\n  * bug fix: type mismatch when assigning to lexical variables no longer result in fasl-dumping internal type objects.

(#504575)\n  * optimization: CALL-NEXT-METHOD using explicit arguments is faster, especially in safe code when none of the required arguments have changed their identities.\n  * bug fix: blocking reads from FIFOs created by RUN-PROGRAM were uninterruptible, as well as blocking reads from socket streams created with for which :SERVE-EVENTS NIL. (regression from 1.0.42.43)\n  * bug fix: SET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR now removes dispatch-macro character syntax from the to-char if the from-char is not a dispatch-macro character.\n  * bug fix: references to undefined variables in function calls that are optimized away now signal a runtime error.

(regression from 1.0.45.18)\n  * bug fix: INITIALIZE-INSTANCE :AROUND methods supplying initargs via CALL-NEXT-METHOD work correctly. (regression from 1.0.45.19)\n  * bug fix: several foreign functions accepting string also accepted NIL and consequently caused a memory fault at 0 now signal a type-error instead. (#721087)\n  * bug fix: under rare circumstances, constraint propagation could rewrite a variable reference to refer to a variable not in scope, causing an error during physical environment analysis when attempting to close over the variable.

(reported by Leslie Polzer)\n  * bug fix: uses of slot accessors on specialized method parameters within the bodies of SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS methods no longer triggers a type error while finalizing the class. This fix may cause classes with slot accessors to be finalized later than previously.

(regression from 1.0.30.38, reported by Samium Gromoff)\n  * bug fix: inspecting closures is less likely to fail with a type error.\n  * bug fix: no timer starvation when setting the system clock back. (launchpad bug #460283)\n  * bug fix: WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX now binds *PRINT-PPRINT-DISPATCH* to the standard pprint dispatch table as specified by CLHS.\n  * bug fix: give CLISP a hint about a type declaration to enable it to build the cross-compiler without warnings. (thanks to Josh Elasser; launchpad bug #396597)\n  * bug fix: correctly dump literal objects in defaulting forms of arglists. (reported by Attila Lendvai; launchpad bug #310132)\n  * bug fix: distinguish in type specifiers between arrays that might be complex and arrays that are definitely complex. (launchpad bug #309129)\n  * bug fix: SUBTYPEP knows that the SYMBOL type is not SUBTYPEP the KEYWORD type. (reported by Levente M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros; launchpad bug #485972)\n  * bug fix: setting the value of a symbol-macro within a method in the presence of type declarations works properly again.

(reported by Time Tossavainen)\n  * bug fix: some forms of AND, OR, and COND resulted in expansions that could result in their subforms being treated as top level forms. (reported by James Knight)\n  * bug fix: On x86/x86-64 alien functions declared to return integers shorter than a machine register could leave garbage in the high bits of the result register (bug 316325).\n  * bug fix: disable address space randomization Linux/x86-64 as well, not just x86-64. (reported by Ken Olum)\n  * bug fix: Attempting to DEREF an (ALIEN (* T)) would produce a WARNING and generate incorrect code.\n  * bug fix: #201; type inference for CONS and ARRAY types could derive wrong results in the presence of eg.

(thanks to Josh Elsasser)\n  * new port: support added for x86-64 Solaris. (thanks to Alex Viskovatoff)\n  * improvement: the system either recovers from stack exhaustion or dies properly as opposed to leaving the user uncertain of whether the handler trampled on some random memory next to the stack or having to rely on --lose-on-corruption (which is still a good idea to use in production because stack exhaustion can happen in signal handlers which will likely lead to hangs.)\n  * bug fix: fix gc related interrupt handling bug on ppc (regression from 1.0.25.37, reported by Harald Hanche-Olsen)\n  * bug fix: work around signal delivery bug in darwin (regression from 1.0.25.44, reported by Sidney Markowitz)\n  * bug fix: fix ERROR leaking memory (reported by David Thompson)\n\n## New in version 1.0.26, 2009-03-01\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: an interruption (be it a function passed to INTERRUPT-THREAD or a timer function) runs in an environment where interrupts can be enabled. The interruption can use WITH-INTERRUPTS or WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS as it sees fit. Use WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS to avoid nesting of interruptions and potentially running out of stack. Keep in mind that in the absence of WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS some potentially blocking operation such as acquiring a lock can enable interrupts.\n  * incompatible change: GC-OFF and GC-ON are removed, as they were always unsafe. Use WITHOUT-GCING instead.\n  * new feature: runtime option --disable-ldb\n  * new feature: runtime option --lose-on-corruption to die at the slightest hint of possibly non-recoverable errors: running out of memory, stack, alien stack, binding stack, encountering a memory fault, etc. In the absence of --lose-on-corruption a warning is printed to stderr.\n  * enhancement: detect binding stack exhaustion\n  * enhancement: detect alien stack exhaustion on x86/x86-64\n  * improvement: generally more stable and reliable interrupt handling\n  * improvement: there is a per thread interruption queue, interruptions are executed in order of arrival\n  * improvement: a repeating timer reschedules itself when the it has finished, but expiration times are spaced equally. If an expiration time is in the past it will trigger after a short grace period that may give a chance to other things to run.\n  * optimization: slightly faster gc on multithreaded builds\n  * optimization: faster WITHOUT-GCING\n  * bug fix: when JOIN-THREAD signals an error, do it when not holding important locks so that the debugger/handler doesn't produce recursive errors or deadlock.\n  * bug fix: real-time signals are not used anymore, so no more hanging when the system wide real-time signal queue gets full.\n  * bug fix: INTERRUPT-THREAD on a dying thread could produce memory fault.\n  * bug fix: finalizers, gc hooks never run in a WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS\n  * bug fix: fix random memory faults related to interrupts on alpha\n  * bug fix: fix random memory faults related to interrupts on sparc\n  * bug fix: fix deadlocks related to starting threads\n  * bug fix: fix deadlines on locks on futex platforms\n  * bug fix: restore errno in signal handlers\n  * bug fix: fix deadlocks related to hash tables\n  * bug fix: fix deadlocks in pcl\n\n## New in version 1.0.25, 2009-02-03\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: SB-INTROSPECT:FUNCTION-ARGLIST is deprecated, to be removed later.

(thanks to Luis Oliveira)\n  * bug fix: errors from invalid fill-pointer values to (SETF FILL-POINTER) are signalled correctly. (thanks to Stas Boukarev)\n  * bug fix: SET-MACRO-CHARACTER accepts NIL as the readtable designator. (thanks to Tobias Rittweiler)\n  * bug fix: SET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER accepts NIL as the readtable designator, and returns T instead of the function. (thanks to Tobias Rittweiler)\n  * bug fix: direct superclasses of STANDARD-CLASS and FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS now default to STANDARD-OBJECT and FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-OBJECT as required by AMOP.\n  * bug fix: compiling a call to SLOT-VALUE with a constant slot-name when no class with the named slot yet exists no longer causes a compile-time style-warning.\n  * bug fix: :ALLOCATION :CLASS slots are type-checked properly in safe code.

(thanks to Harald Hanche-Olsen)\n  * optimization: COPY-SEQ, FILL, and SUBSEQ are 30-80% faster for strings and vectors whose element-type or simplicity is not fully known at compile-time.\n  * optimization: STRING-TRIM and related functions no longer allocate a new string when no trimming needs to be performed. These functions are also faster than before when the input string has been declared as a simple-string.\n  * optimization: READ-SEQUENCE on simple-strings is up to 80% faster.\n  * optimization: READ-LINE is significantly faster for files containing long lines.\n  * optimization: non-open coded uses of character comparison operators (e.g. char=) no longer cons when called with more than one parameter on platforms supporting dynamic-extent allocation.\n  * bug fix: READ-SEQUENCE on composite stream wrapping a Gray stream with STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) signalled an error.\n  * bug fix: COPY-SEQ on lists did not signal a type-error on improper lists in safe code.\n  * bug fix: some sequence functions elided bounds checking when SPEED > SAFETY.\n  * bug fix: too liberal weakening of union-type checks when SPEED > SAFETY.\n  * bug fix: more bogus fixnum declarations in ROOM implementation have been fixed.\n\n## New in version 1.0.12, 2007-11-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * new feature: MAKE-HASH-TABLE now experimentally accepts a :SYNCHRONIZED argument, which makes the hash-table safe for concurrent accesses (but not iteration.) See also: SB-EXT:WITH-LOCKED-HASH-TABLE, and SB-EXT:HASH-TABLE-SYNCHRONIZED-P.\n  * optimization: CONCATENATE on strings is an order of magnitude faster in code compiled with (> SPEED SPACE).\n  * optimization: SUBSEQ is ~50% faster on lists.\n  * bug fix: bug 417 fixed -- source location reporting is now more robust.\n  * bug fix: SUBSEQ on a list will now correctly signal an error if if END is smaller then START.\n  * bug fix: SB-PROFILE will no longer report extra consing for nested calls to profiled functions.\n  * bug fix: ROOM implementation had bogus fixnum declarations which could cause type-errors when calling ROOM on large images.\n  * bug fix: if file compilation is aborted, the partial fasl is now deleted, and COMPILE-FILE returns NIL as the primary value.\n  * bug fix: number of thread safety issues relating to SBCL's internal hash-table usage have been fixed.\n  * bug fix: SB-SYS:WITH-PINNED-OBJECTS could cause garbage values to be returned from its body when the values were being returned using unknown-values return convection and the W-P-O was wrapped inside an UNWIND-PROTECT.\n  * bug fix: sb-posix should now compile again under Windows, enabling slime to work again.\n\n## New in version 1.0.11, 2007-10-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: hash-table accessor functions are no longer automatically protected by locks. Concurrent accesses on the same hash-table from multiple threads can give inconsistent results or even corrupt the hash-table completely. Multi-threaded applications should do their own locking at the correct granularity. In the current implementation it is still safe to have multiple readers access the same table, but it's not guaranteed that this property will be maintained in future releases.\n  * minor incompatible change: (SETF MUTEX-VALUE) is not longer supported, and will signal an error at runtime.\n  * enhancement: SB-THREAD package now exports a semaphore interface.\n  * enhancement: CONS can now stack-allocate on x86 and x86-64.

(thanks to Luis Oliviera)\n  * new feature: SB-CLTL2 contrib module now implements FUNCTION-INFORMATION. (thanks to Larry D'Anna)\n  * optimization: scavenging weak pointers is now more efficient, requiring O(1) instead of O(N) per weak pointer to identify scanvenged vs. unscavenged pointers. (thanks to Paul Khuong)\n  * optimization: typechecking (SETF SLOT-VALUE) is now ~5x faster in method bodies using constant slot-names when the first argument is a specializer parameter for the method.\n  * optimization: SLOT-VALUE &co are now ~50% faster for variable slot names, when the class of the instance is a direct instance STANDARD-CLASS or FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS (making them only 3x as slow as the constant slot-name case.)\n  * optimization: member type construction is now O(N) instead of O(N^2).\n  * optimization: UNION and NUNION are now O(N+M) for large inputs as long as the :TEST function is one of EQ, EQL, EQUAL, or EQUALP.\n  * enhancement: DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO lambda-list information is now more readable in environments like Slime which display it. (thanks to Tobias C. Rittweiler)\n  * bug fix: SB-EXT:COMPARE-AND-SWAP was non-atomic unless the compiler was able to infer the correct argument type for the object on which the CAS operation was being performed.\n  * bug fix: copy propagation interfered with parallel assignment semantics in local calls. (reported by Paul Khuong)\n  * bug fix: the signed modular fixnum shift compiled to wrong code on x86 and x86-64. (spotted by a slight modification to some of PFD's random tests)\n\n## New in version 1.0.9, 2007-08-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: SB-SYS:OUTPUT-RAW-BYTES is deprecated.\n  * enhancement: SB-EXT:FINALIZE accepts a :DONT-SAVE keyword argument, indicating the finalizer should be cancelled when SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE is called.\n  * enhancement: default PRINT-OBJECT methods for classes, slot-definitions, and generic function now print the object identity for anonymous instances. (thanks to Attila Lendvai)\n  * enhancement: as an extension to MOP, SBCL now supports SETF of STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS and FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS. (thanks to Attila Lendvai)\n  * enhancement: sb-cover has an alternate annotation mode which puts the form annotations at the car of the form, instead of annotating it completely. The benefit of this mode is that it shows better which forms were instrumented by the compiler.\n  * bug fix: new compiler transforms for MEMBER and ASSOC were affected by printer control variables. (reported by Dan Corkill)\n  * bug fix: system leaked memory when delayed output was performed by the OS in smaller chunks then expected. (thanks to David Smith)\n  * bug fix: system leaked memory when file streams were not closed properly.\n  * bug fix: large objects written to slow streams that were modified after the write could end up with the modified state written to the underlying file descriptor.\n  * bug fix: multiple threads operating in parallel on the same stream could cause buffer-overflows.\n  * bug fix: source location information is stored correctly (broken since 1.0.6). This bug would generally show up as the Slime debugger highlighting the wrong form when the sldb-show-source command was used.\n  * bug fix: Branch forms are again annotated as branches in the sb-cover annotations.\n  * bug fix: GCD on MOST-NEGATIVE-FIXNUM no longer causes an infinite loop on x86-64. (reported by Gregory Vanuxem)\n  * bug fix: EQUALP could return wrong results for structures with raw slots (slots with a :TYPE of SINGLE-FLOAT, DOUBLE-FLOAT, or a machine word). (reported by Vjacheslav Fyodorov)\n  * bug fix: sb-sprof sampling didn't work on non-x86oid platforms. (patch by Pierre Mai)\n\n## New in version 1.0.8, 2007-07-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: experimental macro SB-EXT:COMPARE-AND-SWAP provides atomic compare-and-swap operations on threaded platforms.\n  * enhancement: experimental function SB-EXT:RESTRICT-COMPILER-POLICY allows assigning a global minimum value to optimization qualities (overriding proclamations and declarations).\n  * enhancement: closed over variables can be stack-allocated on x86 and x86-64.\n  * performance bug fix: GETHASH and (SETF GETHASH) are once again non-consing.\n  * optimization: slot definition lookup is now O(1).

In other cases a specialized version is selected.\n  * bug fix: using obsoleted structure instances with TYPEP and generic functions now signals a sensible error.\n  * bug fix: threads waiting on GET-FOREGROUND can be interrupted. (reported by Kristoffer Kvello)\n  * bug fix: backtrace construction is now more careful when making lisp-objects from pointers on the stack, to avoid creating bogus objects that can be seen by the GC.\n  * bug fix: defaulting of values in contexts expecting more than 7 variables now works on x86-64.

(reported by Sascha Wilde)\n\n## New in version 1.0.7, 2007-06-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * MOP improvement: support for user-defined subclasses of SB-MOP:SPECIALIZER has been enhanced. The experimental interface function SB-PCL:MAKE-METHOD-SPECIALIZERS-FORM, called as part of the expansion of DEFMETHOD, is responsible for generating a form which creates a list of specializers when evaluated. Additional functions SB-PCL:[UN]PARSE-SPECIALIZER-USING-CLASS provide debugging and introspective support.\n  * minor incompatible change: the (unsupported) spinlock interface has changed: free spinlock now has the value NIL, and a held spinlock has the owning thread as its value.\n  * enhancement: WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS now binds ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS and WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS as local macros. Refer to documentation string for details.\n  * enhancement: name of a socket-stream is now \"a socket\" instead of \"a constant string\".\n  * enhancement: SB-POSIX now supports lockf().

(thanks to Kevin Reid)\n  * improvement: macos/x86 and macos/x86-64 now use mach exception handlers for dealing with illegal instructions (for trapping and error handling) and memory protection violations (for GC).\n\n## New in version 1.0.4, 2007-03-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * new platform: experimental support for x86-64/darwin (MacOS).\n  * incompatible change: the thread-safe (on most platforms) getaddrinfo and getnameinfo sockets functions are used instead of gethostbyaddr and gethostbyname, on platforms where the newer functions are available. As a result, the ALIASES field of HOST-ENT will always be NIL on these platforms.\n  * change: runtimes with embedded cores (i.e. saved with :EXECUTABLE T) don't print the startup banner, but behave as if --noinform was passed as a command line argument.

This makes the class-precedence-lists of GENERIC-FUNCTION and STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION comply with the requirement of ANSI 1.4.4.5.\n  * minor incompatible change: the default stream external format on non-unicode SBCL is no longer detected from the locale, but is always ISO-8859-1\n  * new feature: Add a version of evaluator that uses an interpreter instead of the compiler. EVAL still uses the compiler by default, to switch it to use the interpreter, set the value of the variable SB-EXT:*EVALUATOR-MODE* to :INTERPRET.\n  * minor incompatible change: the single-stepper REPL has been merged with the normal debugger (see the \"Stepping\" heading of the debugger help for more details). The debugger command STEP will no longer switch to the single-stepper REPL.\n  * bug fix: ENOUGH-NAMESTRING on pathnames with no name and a pattern for a type now works.\n  * bug fix: loading of default sysinit file works. (thanks to Leonid Slobodov)\n  * bug fix: better detection of circularities in the file-compiler.

(reported by Bruno Haible and Pascal Costanza)\n  * fixed bug #339(c): if there are applicable methods not part of any long-form method-combination group, call INVALID-METHOD-ERROR. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * fixed bug #361: the :FUNCTION initarg in the protocol for initialization of methods can now be used to override internally-produced optimized functions. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * bug fix: extensions of MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA which wrap the system-provided lambda expression no longer cause warnings about unbound #:|pv-table| symbols.\n  * bug fix: improved the handling of type declarations and the detection of violations for keyword arguments with non-constant defaults.\n  * bug fix: potentially erronous calls to PATHNAME and MERGE-PATHNAMES were being flushed in some cases. (reported by Richard Kreuter)\n  * bug fix: compiled calls to TYPEP were mishandling obsolete instances. (reported by James Bielman and Attila Lendvai)\n  * bug fix: format strings with ~> without matching ~< no longer trigger an AVER, but signal an understandable error instead. (reported by Antonio Martinez)\n  * bug fix: specifying an output-file without a pathname-type for COMPILE-FILE or COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME resulted in using the type of input-file instead of \"fasl\". (reported by Robert Dodier)\n  * bug fix: compiler-macro lambda-list parsing of FUNCALL forms. (reported by James Y Knight).\n  * bug fix: compiler-macros-function did not consider the environment argument for shadowing by local functions.\n  * bug fix: compiler-macros expansion was inhibited by local INLINE declarations.\n  * bug fix: inline expansions of known functions were subject to step-instrumentation in high debug policies, leading to problems with type-inference.\n  * bug fix: compiler failed to differentiate between different CONS types in some cases.\n  * bug fix: fixed input, output and error redirection in RUN-PROGRAM for win32. (thanks to Mike Thomas and Yaroslav Kavenchuk)\n  * bug fix: #368: incorrect use of expressed vs. upgraded array element type.\n  * bug fix: #306a: more precise unions of array types.\n  * thread-safety improvements:\n\n    * CONDITION-WAIT could return early on Linux, if the thread was interrupted and subsequently continued with SIGCONT.\n    * STABLE-SORT and ADJUST-ARRAY were not reentrant.\n\n## New in version 0.9.15\n\nBack to top\n\n  * added support for the ucs-2 external format. (contributed by Ivan Boldyrev)\n  * minor incompatible change: pretty printing of objects of type (cons symbol) is, in the default pprint-dispatch-table, now sensitive to whether the symbol satisfies FBOUNDP. (thanks to Marcus Pearce)\n  * minor incompatible change: SB-MOP:FINALIZE-INHERITANCE is now called later in a class's lifetime, possibly as late as when the first instance of the class is created. Previously, SB-MOP:FINALIZE-INHERITANCE was called by the system as soon as a class became finalizeable.\n  * fixed bug: FILE-POSITION sometimes returned inconsistent results for multibyte external-format streams. (thanks to \"vbzoli\")\n  * fixed bug: CHANGE-CLASS would fail to preserve the values of slots with :ALLOCATION :CLASS inherited from superclasses of the original class.\n  * fixed bug: anonymous classes can now be created using the :NAME initarg and MAKE-INSTANCE / REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE, as specified by AMOP.

(reported by Pascal Costanza)\n  * fixed bug: FINALIZE-INHERITANCE is called from REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE on classes when the class has previously been finalized, as required by AMOP.\n  * minor code generation optimizations:\n\n    * better register allocation in CLOS dispatching functions\n    * overflow detection when coercing signed bytes to fixnums on x86-64\n    * is now implemented with one IMUL instruction instead of three shifts\n    * more efficient bit-vector access on x86 and x86-64\n    * more efficient access to raw structure slots on x86 and x86-64\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST.8: ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST must return its argument.\n\n## New in version 0.9.14, 2006-06-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * feature: thread support on Solaris/x86, and experimental thread support on OS X/x86.\n  * feature: SBCL now tries to signal a STORAGE-CONDITION when running out of heap.\n  * feature: SBCL now provides USE-VALUE and STORE-VALUE restarts in the default method for SLOT-UNBOUND.\n  * minor incompatible change: prevent the user from specializing the new-value argument to SB-MOP:SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS. It's somewhat counter to the intent of the protocol, I (CSR) think, and additionally it just doesn't work in SBCL as currently implemented, thanks to optimizations (that are always valid for the other three SLOT-VALUEish functions, but not for the setter).\n  * minor incompatible change: the :SB-LDB feature is now enabled by default, and DISABLE-DEBUGGER and ENABLE-DEBUGGER also affect the low-level debugger.\n  * enchancement: RUN-PROGRAM is now able to extract the file-descriptor from SYNONYM-STREAM and TWO-WAY-STREAM provided they can be decomposed down to an SB-SYS:FD-STREAM, allowing direct communication in more cases. Temporary files and pipes are still used as a fallback strategy.\n  * thread-safety: DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME & GET-DECODED-TIME depended on the non-reentrant C functions localtime(3) and gmtime(3).\n  * bug fix: global optimization policy was not visible in LOCALLY and MACROLET forms.\n  * bug fix: class objects can be used as specializers in methods. (reported by Pascal Costanza)\n  * bug fix: native unparsing of pathnames with :DIRECTORY NIL failed with a type error. (reported by blitz_ on #lisp)\n  * bug fix: unparsing logical pathnames with :NAME :WILD :TYPE NIL failed with a type error. (reported by Pascal Bourguignon)\n  * bug fix: merging pathnames against defaults with :DIRECTORY starting with '(:RELATIVE :BACK) should preserve the :BACK. (reported by James Y Knight)\n  * bug fix: saving large (>2GB) cores on x86-64 now works\n  * bug fix: a x86-64 backend bug when compiling (setf aref) with a constant index and a (simple-array (signed-byte 32)) array\n  * bug fix: NAME-CHAR on an invalid symbol no longer signals an error (patch by Robert J. Macomber)\n  * feature: TIME now displays the amount of run-time spent in GC\n  * bug fix: The debugger now does a better job of respecting (PUSH '(*PRINT-CIRCLE* .

(This is a debugger-only workaround for bug 403.)\n  * bug fix: floating point exception handling now works on FreeBSD (thanks to NIIMI Satoshi)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * MISC.641: LET-conversion were not supposed to work in late compilation stages.\n  * improvements to the Win32/x86 port:\n\n    * GET-INTERNAL-RUN-TIME implemented, thanks to Frank Buss.\n    * improved SB-BSD-SOCKETS support, thanks to Timothy Ritchey.\n\n## New in version 0.9.13, 2006-05-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * new feature: source path information is generated for macro-expansion errors for use in IDE's like Slime (thanks to Helmut Eller)\n  * bug fix: calls to the compiler no longer modify *RANDOM-STATE*\n  * bug fix: compiler does not loop forever on an invalid type in TYPEP.\n  * improvement: compilation of most CLOS applications is significantly faster\n  * optimization: added a limited bytecode compiler for simple toplevel forms, speeding up compilation and FASL loading\n  * bug fix: the statistical profiler now properly distinguishes anonymous functions\n\n## New in version 0.9.12, 2006-04-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: in sbcl-0.9.11 (but not earlier versions) SB-MOP:FINALIZE-INHERITANCE would recursively descend into subclasses of the finalized class. Now user calls to FINALIZE-INHERITANCE finalize just the one class, and calls by the system return before any subclasses are finalized.\n  * minor incompatible change: The reader no longer ignores errors regarding non-existent packages in #+ and #- feature tests.\n  * new feature: command line options --no-sysinit, --no-userinit to inhibit loading the corresponding init files\n  * new feature: add a generic function SOCKET-SEND to SB-BSD-SOCKETS, for sending data through UDP sockets (thanks to Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau)\n  * minor incompatible change: SIGPIPE is ignored and \"Broken pipe\" error is signalled instead (thanks to Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau)\n  * minor incompatible change: Error signalling behaviour of lexical operations violating package locks has changed slightly. Refer to documentation on package locks for details.\n  * enhancement: EVAL can process IF-expressions without resorting to the compiler.\n  * bug fix: Some operations involving SIN, COS, or TAN weren't being constant-folded properly due to missing out-of-line functions. (reported by Mika Pihlajam\u00e4ki)\n  * bug fix: LISTEN sometimes returned T even in cases where no data was immediately available from the stream\n  * fixed bug: types of the last two arguments to SET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR were reversed.

(reported by Utz-Uwe Haus)\n  * bug fix: derivation of float boundaries from numbers outside the appropriate float range (reported by John Wiseman)\n  * bug fix: MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS accepts en empty slot name list.\n  * bug fix: precomputing cache entries for generic functions with some subclasses of specializers as yet invalid does not attempt to fill a cache line with a negative offset. (reported by Levente M\u00e9sz\u00e1roz)\n  * improvements to DOCUMENTATION for TYPE and STRUCTURE doc-types: allow condition class objects as arguments to DOCUMENTATION and (SETF DOCUMENTATION); only find and set documentation for structure names for the STRUCTURE doc-type. (suggested by Gary King)\n  * improvements to the Win32/x86 port:\n\n    * (user-homedir-pathname) and default initialization file locations now know about the user's \"Documents and Settings\" directory (thanks to Yaroslav Kavenchuk)\n    * run-program is implemented (thanks to Mike Thomas)\n    * sockets support (thanks to Timothy Ritchey)\n    * better backtrace support (thanks to Alastair Bridgewater)\n    * sb-grovel supported\n    * asdf-install and sb-posix work somewhat\n    * capable of running Slime using SWANK:*COMMUNICATION-STYLE* NIL\n  * improvements to the Solaris/x86 port:\n\n    * works on Solaris 11/Solaris Express\n    * floating-point exception handling support\n    * support for the breakpoint-based TRACE :ENCAPSULATE NIL facility\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * REMOVE-METHOD returns its generic function argument even when the method is not one of the generic functions' methods.\n    * objects declared as MEMBER types can be admissible arguments to structure accessors.\n    * printing characters should simply be printed by the FORMAT ~:C directive.\n    * compiler failure when compiling functions with hairy constant defaults for optional parameters.\n    * compiler produces wrong code when MAYBE-INLINE-expanding a function, which is already optimized.\n\n## New in version 0.9.11, 2006-03-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * new platform: experimental support for SBCL x86/Darwin, including MacOS X 10.4.5 on Intel.\n  * new feature: Unicode character names are now known to the system (through CHAR-NAME and NAME-CHAR).\n  * new feature: the filesystem location of SBCL's core file is exposed to lisp through the variable SB-EXT:*CORE-PATHNAME*.\n  * minor incompatible change: the contrib modules SB-POSIX and SB-BSD-SOCKETS no longer depend on stub C libraries; the intent of this change is to make it easier to distribute location-independent binaries.\n  * bug fix: as implied by AMOP, standardized classes no longer have slots named by external symbols of public packages. (reported by Pascal Costanza)\n  * optimization: calling functions via constant symbols -- as in (FUNCALL 'FOO) -- is now roughly as efficient as calling them via the function object as in (FUNCALL #'FOO).\n  * optimization: on x86 and x86-64, the calling convention for the case of dealing with an unknown number of values has been altered to be friendlier to the prediction heuristics implemented, particularly with reference to CALL and RET pairing. (thanks to Alastair Bridgewater)\n  * optimization: on x86, the code for access to thread-local symbol values and binding/unbinding of thread-local symbols is smaller. (thanks to Alastair Bridgewater)\n  * enhancement: CONSTANTP is now able to determine constantness of more complex forms, including calls to constant-foldable standardized functions and some special forms beyond QUOTE.\n  * fixed bug: occasional GC crashes on Solaris/x86\n  * optimization: x86-64 supports stack allocation of results of simple calls of MAKE-ARRAY, bound to variables, declared DYNAMIC-EXTENT\n  * enchancement: the PROCESS-INPUT and -OUTPUT streams created by SB-EXT:RUN-PROGRAM can be used for both character and byte IO (thanks to James Knight)\n  * fixed bug: CL:LISTEN always returns NIL at end of file, as required by the standard (thanks to Stephen Compall)\n\n## New in version 0.9.10, 2006-02-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * new feature: new SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE keyword argument :EXECUTABLE can be used for bundling the runtime and the core file into one executable binary. This feature is not currently supported on all SBCL platforms. (thanks to James Bielman and NIIMI Satoshi)\n  * new feature: a generational or ephemeral garbage collector is now the default on the PowerPC platform (both Linux and Darwin). The old Cheney (stop and copy) collector is a build-time option. (thanks to Cyrus Harmon, after Raymond Toy)\n  * minor incompatible change: the method by which SBCL finds its contributed modules has changed; it no longer relies on symbolic links from an $SBCL_HOME/systems directory, but searches directly in the subdirectories of $SBCL_HOME.\n  * enhancement: the dynamic heap size on the Linux/PPC platform is markedly larger, even using the older Cheney garbage collector.\n  * fixed bug #399: full call to DATA-VECTOR-REF in accesses to certain complicated string types. (reported by Gary King)\n  * fixed bug: STRING-TO-OCTETS and OCTETS-TO-STRING did not convert character codes. (thanks to Yaroslav Kavenchuk and Ivan Boldyrev)\n  * fixed bug: DOCUMENTATION on structures no longer signals an error if no structure type of the right name exists.

(reported by Kevin Reid)\n  * fixed bug: metacircle resolution in cases where methods have slots added before the slots from STANDARD-METHOD. (reported by Jean Bresson)\n  * fixed bug: the Power PC assembly code for calling into lisp sometimes computed its return address wrongly (depending on the 15th bit of the address, fixed at link time). This used to manifest itself in a segmentation violation while building PCL. (reported by Kevin Rosenberg, Eric Marsden, Lars Brinkhoff and many others over the years)\n  * fixed bug: ROOM no longer reports silly numbers for stack usage if the stack pointer (treated as a signed integer) is negative. (thanks to Peter van Eynde)\n\n## New in version 0.9.9, 2006-01-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * new platform: experimental support for the Windows operating system has been added.

(thanks to NIIMI Satoshi)\n\n## New in version 0.9.8, 2005-12-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: (SETF CLASS-NAME) and (SETF GENERIC-FUNCTION-NAME) are generic functions once more (reverting the change in the 0.9.7 release). (SETF CLASS-NAME) is specified by ANSI as a generic function, and for consistency (SETF GENERIC-FUNCTION-NAME) is treated likewise.\n  * fixed bug #233.b: make constraint propagation notice when a variable value is changed after it is referenced but before it is used\n  * fixed bug #296: no more arbitrary behaviour from filenames with odd characters as --load arguments. (reported by Adam Warner)\n  * fixed bug #390: :CHARACTER-SET pathname components now work as expected. (reported by Tim Daly Jr)\n  * fixed bug #391: complicated :TYPE intersections in slot definitions no longer cause an error in PCL internals.\n  * fixed bug #392: plugged a hole in the obsolete-instance protocol.\n  * bug fix: FILE-STRING-LENGTH is now external-format sensitive, returning the number of octets which would be written to the file-stream.

As a consolation, however, the SBCL implementation of these functions now calls REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE as specified by AMOP.\n  * bug fix: slot-definition documentation is propagated as per ANSI 7.6.2 to EFFECTIVE-SLOT-DEFINITIONS. COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-SLOT-DEFINITION now receives a :DOCUMENTATION argument, as do eslotd initialization methods. (from Pascal Costanza's \"Closer\" project)\n  * bug fix: REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE on generic functions calls COMPUTE-DISCRIMINATING-FUNCTION (almost) unconditionally, as specified by AMOP.\n  * bug fix: it is now possible to have more than one subclass of STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION without causing stack overflow. (reported by Bruno Haible, Pascal Costanza and others)\n  * bug fix: the dependent update protocol now works for generic functions.

(expt 2 10000000). (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * fixed bug #302: better primitive-type selection for intersection types.\n  * fixed bug #308: non-graphic characters now all have names, as required. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * bug fix: redefining a class with different superclasses now correctly removes it from the direct-subclasses of its previous superclasses. (reported by David Morse)\n  * bug fix: (SETF FIND-CLASS) using a FORWARD-REFERENCED-CLASS as the new value now works. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * bug fix: correct canonicalization of multiple non-standard slot options in DEFCLASS as per AMOP 5.4.2. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * bug fix: SB-MOP:CLASS-PROTOTYPE now signals an error if the class is not yet finalized, as required by AMOP. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * bug fix: SB-MOP:ALLOCATE-INSTANCE method for instances of BUILT-IN-CLASS now exists, an signals an error.\n  * bug fix: duplicate LOOP variable bindings now signal PROGRAM-ERROR during macroexpansion for non-iteration variables as well. (reported by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)\n  * bug fix: Cyclic structures and unprintable objects in compiler messages no longer cause errors. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * bug fix: READ, READ-PRESERVING-WHITESPACE, READ-DELIMITED-LIST, and READ-FROM-STRING all now return a primary value of NIL if *READ-SUPPRESS* is true. (reported by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)\n  * bug fix: Default value of EOF-ERROR-P in READ-FROM-STRING is true. (reported by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)\n  * bug fix: ERROR now signals a TYPE-ERROR if the arguments to ERROR do not designate a condition. (reported by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)\n  * bug fix: UNINTERN, USE-PACKAGE, IMPORT and EXPORT all signal an SB-EXT:NAME-CONFLICT condition (subtype of PACKAGE-ERROR) in the name conflict situations in CLHS 11.1.1.2.5, and provide a restart permitting resolution in favour of any of the conflicting symbols. (reported by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)\n  * bug fix: EQUAL compiler optimizations is less aggressive on strings which can potentially compare true despite having distinct specialized array element types.\n  * bug fix: unit enumerations can be defined without dividing by zero. (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)\n  * FORMAT compile-time argument count checking has been enhanced. (report from Bruno Haible for CMUCL)\n  * a partial workaround for the bug 262: the compiler does not try to inline-expand a local function doing RETURN-FROM from a deleted BLOCK. (thanks to Peter Denno for the bug report and to David Wragg for the simple test case)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * RENAME-PACKAGE allows all package designators as new package names.\n    * constraint propagation and lambda variable substitution are more cautious in dealing with partially deleted code.\n    * compiler sometimes lost reoptimization passes.\n    * CERROR, given a condition as condition designator, passes its remaining arguments to the continue format control without complaint.\n    * Case-altering FORMAT directives work correctly on non-ASCII characters.\n    * The REAL type specifier handles bounds outside the floating point ranges without signalling FLOATING-POINT-OVERFLOW.\n    * Functions with IR1-transformations can create intercomponent references to global functions.\n    * NIL parameter to the FORMAT directive ~^ means `unsupplied parameter'.\n    * FORMAT ~R treats a nil value for its first parameter correctly.\n\n## New in version 0.8.16, 2004-10-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * enhancement: saving cores with foreign code loaded is now supported on x86/NetBSD and sparc/Linux in addition to the previously supported platforms.\n  * bug fix: on some platforms repeated installations caused multiple copies of HTML documentation to be installed -- should not happen any more. (reported by Stefan Scholl)\n  * bug fix: parsing self-recursive alien record types multiple times no longer causes infinite recursion. (reported by Thomas F. Burdick, original patch by Helmut Eller for CMUCL)\n  * bug fix: stack-exhaustion detection works now on NetBSD as well. (thanks to Richard Kreuter)\n  * bug fix: defining classes whose accessors are methods on existing generic functions in other (locked) packages no longer signals bogus package lock violations. (reported by Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 Rideau)\n  * bug fix: special variables as DEFMETHOD parameters no longer have associated bogus type declarations. (reported by David Wragg and Bruno Haible)\n  * bug fix: read-write consistency on streams of element-type (SIGNED-BYTE N) for N > 32\\. (reported by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)\n  * bug fix: redefiniton of the only method of a generic function with no DEFGENERIC no longer emits a full WARNING. In addition, redefinition of generic functions with no DEFGENERIC to an incompatible lambda list now signals an error. (thanks to Zach Beane)\n  * bug fix: DEFGENERIC now works even when there's a function of the same name in an enclosing lexical environment. (thanks to Zach Beane)\n  * fixed compiler failure, caused by instrumenting code during IR1-optimization. (Debian bug report #273606 by Gabor Melis)\n  * optimization: added loop analysis and improved register allocation\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * POSITION on displaced vectors with non-zero displacement returns the right answer.\n    * (SIMPLE-STRING) is a valid type specifier for sequence creators.\n    * *PRINT-LEVEL* handling for slotless structures is pedantically correct.\n    * PPRINT-INDENT accepts a request for an indentation of any REAL.\n    * PPRINT-TAB (and the FORMAT ~T directive) now indent by the correct amounts.\n    * The justification version of the FORMAT ~< directive treats non-zero minpad parameter correctly.\n\n## New in version 0.8.15, 2004-09-29\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: SB-INT:*BEFORE-SAVE-INITIALIZATIONS* and SB-INT:*AFTER-SAVE-INITIALIZATIONS* have been renamed SB-EXT:*SAVE-HOOKS* and SB-EXT:*INIT-HOOKS*, and are now part of the supported interface.\n  * new feature: Single-stepping of code compiled with DEBUG 2 or higher and (> DEBUG (MAX SPACE SPEED)) is now possible.\n  * new feature: saving cores with foreign code loaded is now supported on x86/FreeBSD, x86/Linux, and sparc/SunOS. (based on Timothy Moore's work for CMUCL)\n  * bug fix: DEFTYPE lambda-list parsing now binds unsupplied keyword parameters to * instead of NIL if no initform is supplied. (reported by Johan Bockgaard)\n  * bug fix: DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO lambda-list parsing now binds correctly when FUNCALL appears as the car of the form. Note: despite this FUNCALL forms are not currently subject to compiler-macro expansion. (port of Raymond Toy's fix for the same from CMUCL, reported by Johan Bockgaard)\n  * bug fix: FOR ... ON ... -clauses in LOOP now work on dotted lists (thanks for Teemu Kalvas)\n  * bug fix: in FORMAT ~^ inside ~:{ now correctly steps to the next case instead of terminating the iteration (thanks for Julian Squires, Sean Champ and Raymond Toy)\n  * bug fix: incorrect expansion of defgeneric that caused a style warning. (thanks for Zach Beane)\n  * bug fix: slot accessor effective method computation works properly for classes with multiple non-standard applicable methods on SB-MOP:SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS. (reported by Ralf Mattes)\n  * on x86 compiler supports stack allocation of results of LIST and LIST*, bound to variables, declared DYNAMIC-EXTENT. (based on CMUCL implementation by Gerd Moellmann)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * FORMAT strings with both the ~<~:;~> form of the justification directive and pretty-printing directives cause an error.\n\n## New in version 0.8.14, 2004-08-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: the internal functions SB-KERNEL:32BIT-LOGICAL-FOO, intended for providing efficient logical operations on (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) values, have been renamed to SB-KERNEL:WORD-LOGICAL-FOO. Modular arithmetic should be used instead of the old functions.\n  * new feature: on platforms where \"dladdr\" is available foreign function names now appear in backtraces. (based on Helmut Eller's work for CMUCL)\n  * documentation: documentation for SB-BSD-SOCKETS, SB-GRAY, SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS, and SB-PROFILE have been integrated into the user manual.\n  * documentation: ASDF manual is now distributed with SBCL.\n  * bug fix: SBCL can now load its contributed modules with REQUIRE even if the system-provided entries have been removed from ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*. Infinite recursion in REQUIRE is also detected.\n  * bug fix: backtraces involving undefined functions or assembly routines are more informative. (thanks to Brian Downing)\n  * bug fix: mutually referent alien structures now work correctly. (reported by Rick Taube)\n  * bug fix: structures defined by WITH-ALIEN can be referred to within other definitions in the same WITH-ALIEN.\n  * bug fix: division operators (MOD, TRUNCATE and the like) with constant zero divisors and integer dividends no longer generate left shifts.\n  * bug fix: provide default methods for INPUT-STREAM-P and OUTPUT-STREAM-P specialized on SB-GRAY:FUNDAMENTAL-STREAM.\n  * bug fix: improve the detection and resolution of MOP metacycles (where effective method computation depends on the generic function having its effective method computed). (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * bug fix: pass the right initargs to :BEFORE or :AFTER methods on SHARED-INITIALIZE or INITIALIZE-INSTANCE in optimized MAKE-INSTANCE constructors. (reported by Axel Schairer for cmucl)\n  * bug fix: pathnames with relative directory components can be represented relative to default pathnames.\n  * optimization: in taking the GCD of bignums, reduce the two bignums to approximately the same size (using Euclid's algorithm) before applying the more sophisticated binary GCD. (thanks to Juho Snellman)\n  * optimization: COUNT on bitvectors now operates word-at-a-time.\n  * optimization: ASH with a positive, but not necessarily constant, (leftwards) shift, when in a modular context, is compiled to a hardware shift.\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * FORMAT variable parameters (\"~V<char>\") are defaulted properly if the corresponding argument is NIL.\n    * FORMAT directives accepting a minpad parameter treat negative values as 0.\n    * literal commas as character parameters to FORMAT directives are parsed correctly.\n    * literal spaces directly after ~<Newline> directives within a format-logical-block (~:< ~@:>) do not induce :FILL-style conditional newlines.\n    * PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT inserts spaces as specified (and only as specified: it no longer includes conditional newlines).\n    * PRINC-TO-STRING binds *PRINT-READABLY* to NIL (as well as *PRINT-ESCAPE*).\n    * PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK signals a TYPE-ERROR if its :PREFIX or :PER-LINE-PREFIX argument does not evaluate to a string.\n\n## New in version 0.8.13, 2004-07-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * new feature: SB-PACKAGE-LOCKS. See the \"Package Locks\" section of the manual for details; for now, package locks can be disabled by removing :SB-PACKAGE-LOCKS in customize-target-features.lisp, but if no major problems are found then it is likely that they will be compiled in unconditionally.\n  * major incompatible change: LOAD-FOREIGN and LOAD-1-FOREIGN are now unsupported operators on all platforms. To load a shared library into SBCL, use SB-ALIEN:LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT. To load a non-shared object file, link it into a shared library outside of SBCL and load it using SB-ALIEN:LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT. (incidentally fixes bug #79)\n  * bug workaround: ROOM T and the GC were not working together reliably, because invariants expected by the SB!VM:INSTANCE-USAGE reporting facility aren't preserved. That reporting has been disabled, so now until and unless someone figures out how to make it work reliably with the current GC, (ROOM T) is equivalent to (ROOM).\n  * minor incompatible change: as threatened around sbcl-0.8.0, the home package of MOP-related symbols is now SB-MOP, not SB-PCL. The symbols are also exported from SB-PCL for backwards compatibility, but more so than before SB-PCL should be treated as an implementation-internal package.\n  * fasl format changed: SBCL 0.8.13 fasls are incompatible with those of earlier versions\n  * the SB-SPROF contrib now works on (most) non-x86 architectures. It is known as of this release not to work on the Alpha, however.\n  * fixed bug #167: errors signalled due to illegal syntax in method bodies are now more legible.\n  * fixed bug #338: instances of EQL-SPECIFIER are now valid type designators and can hence be used with TYPEP.\n  * fixed bug #333: CHECK-TYPE now ensures that the type error signalled, if any, has the right object to be accessed by TYPE-ERROR-DATUM. (reported by Tony Martinez)\n  * fixed bug #340: SETF of VALUES obeys the specification in ANSI 5.1.2.3 for multiple-value place subforms. (reported by Kalle Olavi Niemetalo)\n  * fixed bug #334: programmatic addition of slots using specialized methods on SB-MOP:COMPUTE-SLOTS works for :ALLOCATION :INSTANCE and :ALLOCATION :CLASS slots.\n  * fixed bug #269: SCALE-FLOAT scales floats by any integer, not just float exponents. (rereported by Peter Seibel)\n  * fixed a bug: #\\Space (and other whitespace characters) are no longer considered to be macro characters in standard syntax by GET-MACRO-CHARACTER.\n  * fixed bug: initialization of condition class metaobjects no longer causes an instance of the condition to be created. (reported by Marco Baringer)\n  * fixed bug: it is now possible to have slots such that SB-MOP:SLOT-DEFINITION-ALLOCATION of the effective slot description is neither :INSTANCE nor :CLASS.\n  * fixed bug: the ctor optimization of MAKE-INSTANCE now respects user-defined methods on SLOT-BOUNDP-USING-CLASS and (SETF SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS), and no longer causes errors with non-standard SLOT-DEFINITION-ALLOCATION values.\n  * fixed bugs: various race conditions handling exiting threads. CL-PPCRE's thread torture test now passes.\n  * fixed arguably-a-bug: GC time proportional to number of threads in system even when most of them are idle\n  * optimization: improved performance of BIT and SBIT on bit-vectors.\n  * .fasl file incompatibility: The fasl file version number has been incremented because of changes associated with package locks.\n\n## New in version 0.8.12, 2004-06-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: the system no longer provides optimization hints (conditions which are TYPEP SB-EXT:COMPILER-NOTE) for conforming code in default compilation mode; these hints are still emitted when higher SPEED optimization is requested.\n  * new contrib module: a sampling profiler (profiling by statistical sampling, rather than by instrumenting functions) is available as the SB-SPROF contrib. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann and Juho Snellman)\n  * the behaviour of the standard function ED is now customizeable by third parties through a hook variable: see ED's documentation string for information on the protocol.\n  * the compiler no longer emits efficiency notes for (FUNCALL X) when the type of X is uncertain under default optimization settings.\n  * fixed bug 276: mutating a binding of a specialized parameter to a method to something that is not TYPEP the specializer is now possible.\n  * fixed bugs 45d and 118: DOUBLE-FLOAT[-NEGATIVE]-EPSILON now exhibit the required behaviour on the x86 platform. (thanks to Peter van Eynde, Eric Marsden and Bruno Haible)\n  * fixed bug 335: ATANH now computes the inverse hyperbolic tangent even for difficult arguments. (reported by Peter Graves)\n  * fixed bug 141a: the backquote printer now descends quoted structure.\n  * fixed another bug in backquote printing: no more destructive modification of the form's list structure. (reported by Brian Downing)\n  * fixed bug in INTERRUPT-THREAD: pin the function, so that it cannot move between its address being taken and the call to interrupt_thread, fixing a crashing race condition.\n  * the SB-POSIX contrib implementation has been adjusted so that it no longer exhibits ridiculously poor performance when constructing instances corresponding to C structs.\n\n## New in version 0.8.11, 2004-06-07\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: the sb-grovel contrib now treats C structures as alien (in the sense of SB-ALIEN) objects rather than as undistinguished (simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))s. This has implications for memory management of client code (sb-grovel-returned objects must now be manually managed) and for type safety (alien objects now have full types).\n  * new feature: the SB-EXT:MUFFLE-CONDITIONS declaration should be used to control emission of compiler diagnostics, rather than the SB-EXT:INHIBIT-WARNINGS OPTIMIZE quality. See the manual for documentation on this feature. The SB-EXT:INHIBIT-WARNINGS quality should be considered deprecated.\n  * install.sh now installs the user manual as well\n  * (not quite a new documentable feature, but worth considering in the light of the new SB-EXT:MUFFLE-CONDITIONS declaration): the beginnings of a semantically meaningful condition hierarchy is under development, for use in SB-EXT:MUFFLE-CONDITIONS and by IDEs.\n  * fixed bug: PARSE-NAMESTRING now accepts any valid pathaname designator as the defaults argument.\n  * fixed bug: Displaced arrays whose displaced-to array has become too small now cause ARRAY-DIMENSION to signal an error, providing for safer bounds-checking. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * fixed bug: DEFCLASS slot definitions with identical :READER and :WRITER names now signal a reasonable error. (reported by Thomas Burdick)\n  * fixed bug: CLOSE :ABORT T on appending stream no longer causes file deletion.\n  * fixed bug: Invalid slot specification errors now print correctly. (thanks to Zach Beane)\n  * fixed bug 320: Shared to local slot value transfers in class redefinitions now happen corrently from superclasses as well. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * fixed bug 316: SHIFTF now accepts VALUES forms. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * fixed bug 322: DEFSTRUCT :TYPE LIST type predicates now handle improper lists correctly. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * fixed bug 313: source-transform for <fun-name> was erroneously applied to a call of a value of a variable with name <fun-name>. (reported by Antonio Menezes Leitao)\n  * fixed bug 307: The obsolete instance protocol ensures that subclasses are properly obsoleted. (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * fixed bug 298, revealed by Paul F. Dietz' test suite: SBCL can remove dead unknown-values globs from the middle of the stack.\n  * added a new restart to *BREAK-ON-SIGNALS* handling to make it easier to resume long computations after using *BREAK-ON-SIGNALS* to diagnose and fix failures. (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * fixed bug reported by PFD in lisppaste #747 (and Bruno Haible from CLISP test suite): WRITE-TO-STRING is not constant-foldable.\n  * fixed bugs in COMPLEX type specifier: UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE is now consistent with (COMPLEX <x>); bugs in treatment of COMPLEX MEMBER and UNION types have likewise been fixed. (thanks to Bruno Haible)\n  * fixed a (fairly theoretical) bug in string printing: if *PRINT-READABLY* is true, signal PRINT-NOT-READABLE if the string does not have array-element-type equal to the most general string type.\n  * fixed bug: SET-PPRINT-DISPATCH does not immediately resolve function name. (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * fixed bug: compile-time format string checker failed on non-closed ~{. (reported by Thomas F Burdick)\n  * fixed bug: as reported by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo on #lisp IRC, don't warn on legal loop code involving more than one aggregate boolean. (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * fixed bug: as reported by Peter Graves on #lisp IRC, passing a NIL in keyword position to MAKE-PACKAGE was not being reported as invalid.\n  * fixed bug: as reported by Juan Ripoll on cmucl-imp, MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND should be able to lexically bind lambda list keywords.\n  * fixed bugs 280 and 312: the checking for multiple definitions in a file is less likely to become confused by uses of inline functions.\n  * fixed bug: the #S reader macro performs the keyword coercion specified for slot names. (reported by Kalle Niemitalo)\n  * fixed bug: lambda lists may contain symbols whose names start with & but are not lambda-list-keywords; their occurrence triggers a STYLE-WARNING.\n  * fixed bug 321: define-method-combination argument lambda lists do not cause invalid code to be generated when &optional or &aux variables have default values. (reported by Bruno Haible)\n  * fixed bug 327: system subclasses of STRUCTURE-OBJECT or CONDITION have CLOS classes; this appears also to have fixed reported instability in stack exhaustion detection.\n  * fixed bug: the CONTROL-ERROR from ABORT, CONTINUE and MUFFLE-WARNING when no associated restart is present is now printable.\n  * optimization: rearranged the expansion of various defining macros so that each expands into only one top-level form in a :LOAD-TOPLEVEL context; this appears to decrease fasl sizes by approximately 10%.\n  * optimization: used a previously little-used slot in symbols to cache SXHASH values, yielding a 5-10% compiler speedup. (thanks to Juho Snellman)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * MAKE-INSTANCES-OBSOLETE returns the class name when called with a symbol.\n    * Fixed an optimization bug related to inheritance of initforms from local to shared slots.\n    * FILE-POSITION works as specified on BROADCAST-STREAMs.\n    * CAST optimizer forgot to flush argument derived type.\n    * print/read consistency on floats is now orders of magnitude more likely. (thanks also to Bruno Haible for a similar report and discussions)\n    * removed stack cleaning in the cleanup part of UNWIND-PROTECT.\n    * IMAGPART is specified (infelicitously) to return (* 0 <thing>) for objects of type REAL. Make it so.\n    * SXHASH is specified (infelicitously) to respect similarity, which means that (SXHASH 0.0) must equal (SXHASH -0.0). Make it so. (thanks to Markus Ziegler)\n    * on the Alpha, the compiler succeeds in compiling functions returning a known number of arguments greater than 63.\n    * fixed handling of invalid NIL arguments in keyword position in local calls.\n    * fixed non-pretty printing of arrays with *PRINT-RADIX* being true.\n    * provided a readably-printable representation for RANDOM-STATE objects.\n    * ensured that pathnames, where they have a namestring, always print using #P\"...\" syntax.\n\n## New in version 0.8.10, 2004-04-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * Support for the forthcoming 2.0 version of the NetBSD kernel running on x86 hardware has been added. (thanks to Perry E. Metzger most immediately, and others for their past work)\n  * SBCL now runs on OpenBSD 3.4. (Thanks to Scott Parish; 3.4 is the current release version; SBCL's OpenBSD support had been broken since about the time of OpenBSD's switch to ELF binary format.)\n  * [placeholder for DX summary]\n\n    * user code with &REST lists declared dynamic-extent, under high speed or space and low safety and debug optimization policy.\n  * The manual has been converted to Texinfo format and the debugger chapter from the cmucl manual has been added.\n  * A facility has been added to extract documentation strings from sbcl and store them as Texinfo-formatted snippets for inclusion in the manual (via Texinfo's @include directive)\n  * bug fix: compiler emitted division in optimized DEREF. (thanks for the test case to Dave Roberts)\n  * bug fix: multidimensional simple arrays loaded from FASLs had fill pointers. (reported by Sean Ross)\n  * bug fix: PROFILE output is printed nicely even for large numerical values. (thanks to Zach Beane)\n  * bug fix: streams with element-type (SIGNED-BYTE <N>) for <N> greater than 32 handle EOF correctly.\n  * bug fix: on X86 an immediate argument of the IMUL instruction is correctly printed in disassembly. (thanks to Lutz Euler)\n  * bug fix: class slots in redefined classes preserve their old values. (thanks to Bruno Haible and Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * bug fix: compilation of funcalls of CXX+R (e.g. CDDR) now succeeds. (reported by Marco Baringer)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * READ-SEQUENCE now works on ECHO-STREAMs.\n    * RATIONALIZE works more according to its specification. (thanks to Bruno Haible)\n\n## New in version 0.8.9, 2004-03-24\n\nBack to top\n\n  * deprecation of old extension: *DEBUG-PRINT-LEVEL* and *DEBUG-PRINT-LENGTH* are now deprecated in favor of the new, more general SB-DEBUG:*DEBUG-PRINT-VARIABLE-ALIST* mechanism. (This should matter to you only if you rebind the printer control variables and then find you want different bindings in the debugger than in the ordinary execution of your program.)\n  * The runtime build system has been tweaked to support building (on SPARC/SunOS) using a C compiler which invokes Sun's own assembler and linker. (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * Unbound, undefined, undeclared variables now trigger full WARNINGs, not just STYLE-WARNINGs, on the assumption that this is more often programmer error than deliberate exploitation of undefined behaviour.\n  * optimization: the hash algorithm for strings has changed to one that is less vulnerable to spurious collisions. (thanks to Juho Snellman)\n  * optimization: VECTOR-POP, VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND and REPLACE do less needless bounds checking. (thanks to Juho Snellman)\n  * optimization: implemented multiplication as a modular (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) operation on the PPC backend.\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * ADJUST-ARRAY now copies the datum in a zero rank array if required.\n    * ADJUST-ARRAY no longer adjusts non-adjustable arrays.\n    * MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM accepts NIL as a value for :END.\n    * MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM functions correctly for strings with element-type NIL.\n    * CLEAR-INPUT accepts NIL and T for its (optional) stream argument.\n    * Ratios can now be printed correctly with *PRINT-BASE* bound to 2, 8 or 16.\n    * ECHO-STREAMs no longer attempt to echo the end of file value to their output stream on EOF from read.\n    * CONCATENATED-STREAM-STREAMS discards constituent streams which have been read to end-of-file.\n    * CLOSE works as expected on the null CONCATENATED-STREAM, and on STRING-STREAMS.\n    * Printing symbols with *PRINT-CASE* :CAPITALIZE respects the description of determination of which consecutive characters constitute a word.\n    * Printing the \"Space\" character with escaping on now yields \"#\\\\\\ \", rather than \"#\\\\\\Space\", as mandated by ANSI 22.1.3.2.\n    * Reading floating-point numbers with *READ-BASE* set to a number less than 10 works correctly.\n    * Reading floating-point numbers with *READ-BASE* set to a number more than 10 works correctly.\n    * Printing with *PRINT-READABLY* targets the standard readtable, not the readtable currently in effect.\n\n## New in version 0.8.8, 2004-02-24\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: parsing of namestrings on a physical (Unix) host has changed; numbers after the final #\\\\. in a namestring are no longer interpreted as a version field. This is intented to be largely invisible to the user, except that the meaning of the namestring \"*.*.*\" has changed: it now refers to a pathname with :TYPE :WILD :NAME #<pattern \"*.*\">. This namestring should usually be replaced by (make-pathname :name :wild :type :wild :version :wild) with the added benefit that this is more likely to be portable. As a consequence of this change, the :IF-EXISTS :NEW-VERSION option to OPEN now signals an error if the file being opened exists; this may have an impact on existing code.\n  * fixed bug 190: RUN-PROGRAM should now work properly, respecting signals received, on the PowerPC platforms (both Linux and Darwin). (thanks to Pierre Mai for pointing out the location of the error)\n  * several fixes on OS X: The system now builds and runs cleanly on Panther (10.3), and works around sigreturn bug (no more SIGFPEs). (thanks to Brian Mastenbrook)\n  * bug fix: DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME now accepts timezone arguments with second-resolution: integer multiples of 1/3600 between -24 and 24. (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)\n  * bug fix: functions =, /=, <, <=, >, >= did not check the argument type when called with 1 argument; PEEK-CHAR checked type of PEEK-TYPE only after having read first character from a stream. (reported by Peter Graves)\n  * bug fix: the garbage collector now has much better locality behaviour, and in particular no longer treats all memory as being exhausted when many small objects point to each other in a deeply recursive manner.\n  * bug fix: arrays specialized on (UNSIGNED-BYTE 15) are now recognized as being TYPEP their class.\n  * bug fix: the PUSHNEW documentation string has been corrected. (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)\n  * bug fix: defaulting of the value for the last of an atypically large number of multiple values being bound was not being performed correctly on the Alpha or PPC platforms\n  * optimization: implemented multiplication as a modular (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) operation on the x86 backend.\n  * optimization: SEARCH on simple-base-strings can now be open-coded. (see also contrib/compiler-extras.lisp for inspiration for teaching the compiler about the Boyer-Moore algorithm).\n  * value, returned by MAX (and MIN) called with several EQUALP, but not EQL, arguments now does not depend on compiler settings.\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * in stack analysis liveness information is propagated from non-local entry points.\n    * pathwise CAST removing failed when the CAST node did not start a block.\n    * INPUT-STREAM-P, OUTPUT-STREAM-P, STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE and OPEN-STREAM-P signal a TYPE-ERROR if their argument is not a stream.\n    * LOAD-LOGICAL-PATHNAME-TRANSLATIONS returns NIL if the logical host is already defined.\n    * RENAME-FILE works on streams instead of signalling an internal type error.\n    * PEEK-CHAR uses the current readtable when determining whether or not a character is whitespace.\n    * MERGE-PATHNAMES handles the case when the pathname does not specify a name while the default-pathname specifies a version.\n    * Pathnames now stand a better chance of respecting print/read consistency.\n    * Attempting to use standardized file system operators with a pathname with invalid :DIRECTORY components signals a FILE-ERROR.\n    * OPEN :DIRECTION :IO no longer fails to work on non-existent files.\n    * DIRECTORY on logical pathnames is more correct.\n    * CLEAR-INPUT, CLEAR-OUTPUT, FINISH-OUTPUT and FORCE-OUTPUT signal a TYPE-ERROR if their argument is not a stream.\n    * READ-BYTE and WRITE-BYTE signal a TYPE-ERROR if their stream designator argument does not designate a stream.\n    * OPEN-STREAM-P and INPUT-STREAM-P on synonym streams work by examining the synonym.\n    * STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE and FRESH-LINE on broadcast-streams now work as specified.\n    * OPEN and WITH-OPEN-STREAM allow opening streams with element-type larger than ([UN]SIGNED-BYTE 32).\n\n## New in version 0.8.7, 2003-12-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * When built with the :SB-FUTEX feature, threaded builds now take advantage of the \"fast userspace mutex\" facility in Linux kernel 2.6 for faster/more reliable mutex and condition variable support.\n  * Incompatible change (but one you probably shouldn't have been using anyway): the interface and code for arbitrating between multiple threads in the same user session has been redesigned.\n  * bug fix: GET-SETF-EXPANSION no longer throws an internal type error when called without an explicit environment argument. (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * bug fix: buffered :DIRECTION :IO streams are less likely to become confused about their position. (thanks to Adam Warner and Gerd Moellmann)\n  * bug fix: Pretty printing backquoted forms with unquotations in the argument list position of various code constructs such as LAMBDA now works correctly. (reported by Paul Dietz)\n  * bug fix: Pretty printing unquotations no longer loses all stream position information.\n  * optimization: performance of string output streams is now less poor for multiple small sequence writes.\n  * optimization: performance of CSUBTYPEP in the presence of complex expressions involving CONS and NOT many times has been improved. (reported by Paul Dietz)\n  * ASDF-INSTALL bug fix: now parses *PROXY* properly. (thanks to Sean Ross)\n  * SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS enhancement: simple-streams can now be used as streams for the REPL, for the debugger, and so on. (thanks to David Licteblau)\n  * DEFINE-CODITION is more efficient. (thanks to Brian Mastenbrook)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * the value of the :REHASH-THRESHOLD argument to MAKE-HASH-TABLE is ignored if it is too small, rather than propagating through to cause DIVIDE-BY-ZERO or FLOATING-POINT-OVERFLOW errors.\n    * extremely complex negations of CONS types were not being sufficiently canonicalized, leading to inconsistencies in SUBTYPEP.\n    * VALUES tranformer lost derived type.\n\n## New in version 0.8.6, 2003-11-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * fixed a bootstrapping bug: the build process no longer assumes that the various BOOLE-related constants have the same value in host and target lisps. (noted by Paul Dietz' test suite on an SBCL binary built from CLISP)\n  * The system can now be dynamically linked on the MIPS platform, which enables dynamic loading of foreign code from Lisp. (thanks to Ralf Baechle for discussions on the MIPS ABI)\n  * The system now records debugging information for its own source files in a filesystem-position-independent manner, relative to the \"SYS\" logical host.\n  * fixed a compiler bug: MV-LET convertion did not check references to the \"max args\" entry point. (reported by Brian Downing)\n  * tweaked disassembly notes to be less confident about proclaiming some instruction as an LRA. (thanks to Brian Downing)\n  * contrib update: SB-ACLREPL is now threadsafe; multiple listeners now each have their own history, command character, and other characteristics. (thanks to David Lichteblau)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * compiler failure in compiling LOGAND expressions including a constant 0\n    * Implementation of ASH-MOD32 on X86 and PPC did not work for the shift greater than 32.\n    * FLUSH-DEST did not mark blocks for type check regeneration.\n    * HANDLER-CASE failed to accept declarations in handler clauses in some circumstances.\n\n## New in version 0.8.5\n\nBack to top\n\n  * New code in contrib/sb-introspect (still probably not entirely stable yet) provides some support for smart Lisp development environments like SLIME.\n  * The conditions signalled for errors occurring when loading .fasl files have been systematized (inheriting from SB-EXT:INVALID-FASL) in a way which should help ASDF recover gracefully.\n  * The REQUIRE/PROVIDE behavior of *MODULE-PROVIDER-FUNCTIONS* stuff has been cleaned up. If you code contrib/ stuff, this might affect you, and you can look at contrib/README, contrib/STANDARDS, and/or the 0.8.4.27 diff to check.\n  * In full calls the compiler now does not generate checks for declared argument types for all arguments.\n  * various threading fixes\n\n    * and some experimental patches which didn't make it into the main tree for this release, but which are shipped in contrib/experimental-thread.patch as a possible fix for some failures (deadlock, spinning...) in GC-intensive multithreaded applications.\n  * fixed PPC build problem (source code incompatibility of different library versions): added offsetof() hackery which attempts to divine where glibc maintainers put uc_mcontext today\n  * fixed bug 282: compiler does not trust type assertions while passing arguments to a full call.\n  * fixed bug 261: compiler allows NIL or \"no value\" to be accepted for &OPTIONAL VALUES type parameter.\n  * fix bug 214: algorithm for noting rejected templates is now more similar to that of template seletion. (also reported by rydis on #lisp)\n  * fixed bug 141b: printing backquoted information readably and prettily inserts a space where necessary.\n  * bug fix: obviously wrong type specifiers such as (FIXNUM 1) or (CHARACTER 10) are now reported as errors, rather than propagated as unknown types. (reported by piso on #lisp)\n  * bug fix: the :IF-EXISTS argument to OPEN now behaves correctly with values NIL and :ERROR. (thanks to Milan Zamazal)\n  * fixed bug 191c: CLOS now does proper keyword argument checking as described in CLHS 7.6.5 and 7.6.5.1.\n  * bug fix: LOOP forms using NIL as a for-as-arithmetic counter no longer raise an error; further, using a list as a for-as-arithmetic counter now raises a meaningful error.\n  * fixed bug 213a: even fairly unreasonable CONS type specifiers are now understood by sequence creation functions such as MAKE-SEQUENCE and COERCE.\n  * fixed bug 46k: READ-BYTE now signals an error when asked to read from a STRING-INPUT-STREAM.\n  * compiler enhancement: SIGNUM is now better able to derive the type of its result.\n  * type declarations inside WITH-SLOTS are checked. (reported by salex on #lisp)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * incorrect optimization of TRUNCATE for a positive first argument and negative second.\n    * compiler failure in let-convertion during flushing dead code.\n    * compiler failure while deriving type of TRUNCATE on an interval, containing 0.\n    * ASH of a negative bignum by a negative bignum count now returns -1, not 0.\n    * intersection of CONS types now canonicalizes properly, fixing inconsistencies in SUBTYPEP.\n\n## New in version 0.8.4, 2003-10-02\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: The --disable-debugger command line option now clobbers the debugger at a more fundamental level, by redefining #'INVOKE-DEBUGGER instead of by rebinding *DEBUGGER-HOOK*. The main difference is that BREAK is specified by ANSI to ignore *DEBUGGER-HOOK* and INVOKE-DEBUGGER regardless. Under the old system, BREAK would enter the debugger REPL and then suffer recursive errors because *DEBUG-IO* is also messed up in --disable-debugger mode; while under the new system, BREAK in --disable-debugger mode terminates the system just as an unhandled error would.\n  * fixed compiler performance when processing loops with a step >1;\n  * bug fix: DOCUMENTATION now retrieves generic function documentation. Also, DOCUMENTATION and (SETF DOCUMENTATION) support has been systematized, and now supports the methods specified by ANSI, along with a default method and a method for slot documentation. (reported by Nathan Froyd)\n  * bug fix: effective methods associated with a generic function are no longer cached over a change of that generic function's method combination. (reported by Andreas Fuchs)\n  * bug fix: RUN-PROGRAM now does not fail if some element in $PATH names a non-existent directory. (thanks to Andreas Fuchs)\n  * bug fix: ROUND and TRUNCATE could, under certain circumstances on the PPC platform, lead to stack corruption; this has been fixed. (reported by Rainer Joswig)\n  * bug fix: ASH on an (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) with a shift of -32 or lower no longer ever returns 1 instead of 0. (thanks to Lars Brinkhoff)\n  * fixed bug 285: TRUNCATE on bignum arguments, and indeed bignum arithmetic in general, is now much more reliable on the PPC platform.\n  * bug fix: LOGCOUNT on (UNSIGNED-BYTE 64) objects on the Alpha platform now returns the right answer.\n  * optimization: restored some effective method precomputation in CLOS (turned off by an ANSI fix in sbcl-0.8.3); the amount of precomputation is now tunable.\n  * optimization: compiler-internal data structure use has been reviewed, and changes have been made that should improve the performance of the compiler by about 20%.\n  * optimization: performance of FILL (and :INITIAL-ELEMENT) on simple-base-strings and simple-bit-vectors is improved.\n  * optimization: the optimization of 32-bit logical and arithmetic functions introduced in version 0.8.3 on the x86 has been implemented on the mips, ppc and sparc platforms; an implementation of the same facility, but for 64-bit arithmetic, has been added for the alpha.\n  * microoptimization: the compiler is better able to make use of the x86 LEA instruction for multiplication by constants.\n  * bug fix: in some situations compiler did not report usage of generic arithmetic in (SPEED 3) policy.\n  * bug 145b fix: compiler used wrong type specifier while converting MEMBER-types to numeric.\n  * bug fix: COMPILE-FILE must bind *READTABLE*. (reported by Doug McNaught)\n  * bug fix: (SETF AREF) on byte-sized-element arrays with constant index argument now works properly on the Alpha platform.\n  * bug fix: floating point exception treatment on the Alpha platform is improved.\n  * bug fix: FILE-POSITION works much better on string input and output streams. (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * bug fix: many threading/garbage collection symptoms sorted. SB-THREAD:INTERRUPT-THREAD now safe to call on a thread that might be pseudo-atomic.\n  * internal change: Stopping for GC is now done with signals not ptrace. GC is now done in whichever thread wanted it, instead of in the parent.\n  * bug fix: GC hooks (missing since 0.8) reinstated, so finalizers work again.\n  * bug fix: result form in DO is not contained in the implicit TAGBODY.\n  * incompatible change: ICR structure is changed; the value part of CONTINUATION is now called LVAR; corresponding functions are renamed (e.g. SB-C::CONTINUATION-TYPE has become SB-C::LVAR-TYPE).\n  * added type deriver for ISQRT (thanks to Robert E. Brown).\n  * bug fix: better support for loading from the command line when an initialization file sets (READTABLE-CASE *READTABLE*). (thanks to Adam Warner)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * the RETURN clause in LOOP is now equivalent to DO (RETURN ...).\n    * ROUND and FROUND now give the right answer when given very small float arguments.\n    * (FLOAT X) for X of type DOUBLE-FLOAT now returns X in all circumstances.\n    * optimizer for (EXPT X 0) did not work for X not of type FLOAT.\n    * (GCD 0 <negative-integer>) returned <negative-integer>.\n    * LCM should return a non-negative integer.\n    * PARSE-INTEGER returned the index of a terminator instead of the upper bounding index of a substring in case :JUNK-ALLOWED NIL.\n    * PARSE-INTEGER returned an incorrect index being applied to a displaced string.\n    * LCM with two arguments of 0 returns 0 rather than signalling DIVISION-BY-ZERO.\n    * unsigned addition of a 32-bit constant with the high bit set no longer causes an internal compiler error on the x86.\n    * LOGBITP accepts a non-negative bignum as its INDEX argument.\n    * compiler incorrectly derived types of DPB and DEPOSIT-FIELD with negative last argument.\n    * byte specifiers with zero size and position no longer cause an error during type derivation.\n    * bignum multiplication on the Alpha platform now returns the right answer.\n  * porting: The system now builds on SuSE AMD64, although it still generates a 32-bit binary.\n  * .fasl file incompatibility: The fasl file version number has been incremented (because of the changes to internal compiler data structures referred to above).\n\n## New in version 0.8.3, 2003-08-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * SBCL now builds and runs on MacOS X (version 10.2), or perhaps more accurately, on the Darwin kernel running on PowerPC hardware. (thanks to Brian Mastenbrook, Pierre Mai and Patrik Nordebo)\n  * Compiler code deletion notes now signal a condition of type SB-EXT:CODE-DELETION-NOTE (a subtype of SB-EXT:COMPILER-NOTE) with an associated MUFFLE-WARNING restart.\n  * The compiler now performs limited argument count validation of constant format strings in FORMAT, and where appropriate in ERROR, CERROR and WARN. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * New ASDF-INSTALL contrib can be used for automatic download and installation of third-party Lisp code from CCLAN or other sites via CLiki.\n  * Threaded builds (:SB-THREAD) now support SB-THREAD:INTERRUPT-THREAD, which forces another thread to execute a function supplied by the caller.\n  * bug 75 fix: WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING (and MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM) now accept and act upon their :ELEMENT-TYPE keyword argument. (reported by Martin Atzmueller, Edi Weitz)\n  * bug fix: FILE-POSITION now accepts position designators up to ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT or the extreme of the off_t range, whichever is the greater. (thanks to Patrik Nordebo)\n  * bug fix: MAKE-ARRAY ignored :INITIAL-CONTENTS NIL. (reported by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo)\n  * bug fix: the CLASS-PROTOTYPE of the GENERIC-FUNCTION class is now printable. (reported by Eric Marsden)\n  * bug fix in sb-posix: mmap() now works on systems with a 64-bit off_t, including Darwin and FreeBSD. (thanks to Andreas Fuchs)\n  * x86 bug fix in control stack exhaustion checking: now shows backtrace\n  * bug fix in WITH-TIMEOUT: now the body can have more than one form. (thanks to Stig Sandoe)\n  * bug fix in READ-SEQUENCE: READ-SEQUENCE following PEEK-CHAR or UNREAD-CHAR now correctly includes the unread character in the target sequence. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * bug fix in threaded builds: the system can now be suspended and resumed by shell job control with minimal disruption.\n  * bug fixes in times and timezones >2038AD\n  * better handling of \"where is GNU make?\" problem in build scripts (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * new optimization: inside a named function any reference to a function with the same name is considered to be a self-reference; this behaviour is controlled with SB-C::RECOGNIZE-SELF-CALLS optimization quality.\n  * new optimization on x86: logical functions and + now have optimized (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) versions, which are automatically used when the result is truncated to 32 bits.\n  * VALUES declaration is partially enabled.\n  * fixes in SB-GROVEL (thanks to Andreas Fuchs)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * The system now obeys the constraint imposed by UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE that the upgraded array element types form a lattice under type intersection.\n    * FFLOOR, FTRUNCATE, FCEILING and FROUND work with integers.\n    * ASSOC now ignores NIL elements in an alist.\n    * CEILING now gives the right answer with MOST-NEGATIVE-FIXNUM and (1+ MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM) answers.\n    * The addition of a method with invalid qualifiers to a generic function does not cause an error to be signalled immediately; a warning is signalled, and the error is generated only on calling the generic function.\n  * changed .fasl file version number, in part to add type codes for new array subtypes UNSIGNED-BYTE 7, 15, 29, and 31 mandated by obscure ANSI requirements\n\n## New in version 0.8.2, 2003-07-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * fixed bug 148: failure to inline-expand a local function left garbage, confusing the compiler.\n  * fixed bugs 3cd: structure slot readers perform type check if the slot can have an invalid value (i.e. it is either not initialized or can be written with a less specific slot writer).\n  * bug fix: the compiler now traps array references to elements off the end of an array; previously, the bounds checking in some circumstances could go off-by-one.\n  * improved MACHINE-VERSION, especially on Linux (thanks to Lars Brinkhoff)\n  * type declarations for array element types now obey the description on the CLHS page \"Declaration TYPE\", as per discussions on sbcl-help around 2003-05-08. This means that a declaration (TYPE (ARRAY FOO) BAR) means that, within the scope of the declaration, all references to BAR will be asserted or assumed (with THE, so dependent on compiler policy) to involve objects of type FOO. Note that no such declaration is implied in (MAKE-ARRAY .. :ELEMENT-TYPE 'FOO).\n  * declared types of functions from the \"Conditions\" chapter. (reported by Paul Dietz)\n  * bug fix: CERROR accepts a function as its first argument.\n  * bug fix: NTH an NTHCDR accept a bignum as index arguments. (reported by Adam Warner)\n  * optimization: character compare routines now optimize comparing against a constant character. (reported by Gilbert Baumann)\n  * bug fix: (SETF AREF) on byte-sized-element arrays with constant index argument now works properly on the MIPS platform.\n  * fixed compiler failure on (TYPEP x '(NOT (MEMBER 0d0))).\n  * repeated evaluation of the same DEFSTRUCT, a slot of which is declared to have a functional type, does not cause an error anymore.\n  * fixed bug: sometimes MAKE-INSTANCE did not work with classes with many :DEFAULT-INITARGS. (reported by Istvan Marko)\n  * fixed bug: if last continuation of a deleted block has a destination, this destination should be deleted too. (reported by ohler on #lisp)\n  * fixed a bug in the bootstrap process: the host compiler's values of ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT and ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT no longer leak into the newly-built SBCL. (reported by Eric Marsden on #lisp, test case from Patrik Nordebo)\n  * improved the ability of the disassembler on the PPC platform to provide helpful disassembly notes.\n  * SB-MOP:CLASS-PROTOTYPE on built-in-classes returns an instance of the class in more cases than previously.\n  * bug fix: FILE-POSITION now understands :START and :END for STRING-INPUT-STREAMs. (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * bug fix: (SIGNED-BYTE 8) streams no longer return (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) data. (thanks to David Lichteblau)\n  * bug fix: it is possible to add a method to a generic function without lambda list.\n  * bug fix: reader failed to signal END-OF-FILE inside an object representation. (reported by Nikodemus Siivola)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * LAST and [N]BUTLAST should accept a bignum.\n    * condition slot accessors are methods.\n    * (VECTOR NIL) is a subtype of STRING.\n\n## New in version 0.8.1, 2003-06-22\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: some nonsensical specialized lambda lists (used in DEFMETHOD) which were previously ignored now signal errors.\n  * minor incompatible change: the system is now aware of the types of variables in the COMMON-LISP package, and will signal errors for most violations of these type constraints (where previously they were silently accepted).\n  * minor incompatible change: COMPILE-FILE now uses the freedom afforded (ANSI 3.2.2.3) to use derived function types for functions defined in the same file. This also permits the system to warn on static type mismatches and function redefinition. (Currently it does not work with high DEBUG level.)\n  * minor incompatible change: VALUES declaration is disabled.\n  * When issuing notes, the compiler now signals a condition of type SB-EXT:COMPILER-NOTE, and provides an associated MUFFLE-WARNING restart for use in user handlers. It is expected that the COMPILER-NOTE condition will eventually become a condition supertype to a hierarchy of note types, which will then be handleable in a similar fashion. However, at the moment, no such note subtypes yet exist. (SB-INT:SIMPLE-COMPILER-NOTE exists, but it's an implementation detail, not a classification for the purpose above.)\n  * Changes in type checking closed the following bugs:\n\n    * type checking of unused values (192b, 194d, 203);\n    * template selection based on unsafe type assertions (192c, 236);\n    * type checking in branches (194bc).\n  * A short form of VALUES type specifier has ANSI meaning (it has increased the number of situations when SBCL cannot perform type checking).\n  * fixed bug in DEFSTRUCT: once again, naming structure slots with keywords or constants is permissible.\n  * STREAM-READ-SEQUENCE and STREAM-WRITE-SEQUENCE now have methods defined on the relevant FUNDAMENTAL-BINARY-{INPUT,OUTPUT}-STREAM classes. (thanks to Antonio Martinez)\n  * improved ANSIness in DESCRIBE: The DESCRIBE function no longer outputs FRESH-LINE or TERPRI, and no longer converts its stream argument to a pretty-print stream. Instead, it leaves any such operations to DESCRIBE-OBJECT methods.\n  * bug fix: APROPOS now respects the EXTERNAL-ONLY flag. (reported by Teemu Kalvas)\n  * bug fix: NIL is now a valid destructuring argument in DEFMACRO lambda lists. (thanks to David Lichteblau)\n  * bug fix: Defining a generic function with a :METHOD-CLASS being a subclass of STANDARD-METHOD no longer causes stack exhaustion. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * fixed bug 246: increased compilation speed of long MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (and likewise of NTH-VALUE with a constant integer argument)\n  * a contributed module implementing COMPILER-LET and MACROEXPAND-ALL has been included.\n  * DEFCONSTANT now throws a condition of type SB-EXT:DEFCONSTANT-UNEQL if it is being asked to redefine a constant to a non-EQL value; CONTINUE and ABORT restarts respectively change and preserve the value.\n  * fixed bug 63: The code walker, part of the implementation of CLOS, is now better at handling symbol macros.\n  * bug fix: There is no longer an internal implementation type named CL:LENGTH. (reported by Raymond Toy)\n  * bug fix: In macro-like defining macros/special operators the implicit block does not enclose the lambda list.\n  * fixed bugs 10 and 43: Bare VALUES, AND, OR and MEMBER symbols (not enclosed in parentheses) are not suitable as type specifiers, and their use properly signals an error now.\n  * bug fix: An argument count mismatch for a type specifier in code being compiled no longer causes an unhandled error at compile time, but signals a compile-time warning.\n  * fixed simple vector readable printing\n  * bug fix: DESCRIBE takes more care over whether the class precedence list slot of a class is bound before accessing it. (reported by Markus Krummenacker)\n  * bug fix: FORMATTER can successfully compile pretty-printer format strings which use variants of the ~* directive inside.\n  * bug fix: SEARCH now applies its TEST predicate to the elements of the arguments in the correct order. (thanks to Wolfhard Buss)\n  * fixed bug 235b: The compiler uses return types of MAPCAR and friends in type inference. (thanks to Robert E. Brown)\n  * bug fix: Reading in symbols with an explicit package name of \"\" (e.g. '||::FOO) now works correctly. (reported by Henrik Motakef)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * NIL is now allowed as a structure slot name.\n    * Arbitrary numbers, not just REALs, are allowed in certain circumstances in LOOP for-as-arithmetic clauses.\n    * Multiple class redefinitions before slot access no longer causes a type error.\n    * (SETF FIND-CLASS) now accepts NIL as an argument to remove the association between the name and a class.\n    * Generic functions with non-standard method-combination and over five methods all of which return constants no longer return NIL after the first few invocations. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n    * CALL-NEXT-METHOD with no arguments now passes the original values of the arguments, even in the presence of assignment.\n    * Functions [N]SUBST*, LAST, NRECONC, [N]SUBLIS may return any object.\n    * DISASSEMBLE works with closures and funcallable instances.\n    * ADD-METHOD now returns the generic function, not the new method.\n    * FIND-METHOD signals an error if the lengths of the specializers is incompatible with the generic function, even if the ERRORP argument is true.\n    * TYPE-OF returns recognizeable subtypes of all built-in-types of which its argument is a member.\n    * DEFCLASS only redefines the class named by its class-name argument if that name is the proper name of the class; otherwise, it creates a new class.\n    * SLOT-UNBOUND now correctly initalizes the CELL-ERROR-NAME slot of the UNBOUND-SLOT condition to the name of the slot.\n    * (SETF (AREF bv 0) ...) did not work for bit vectors.\n    * SLOT-UNBOUND and SLOT-MISSING now have their return values treated by SLOT-BOUNDP, SLOT-VALUE, (SETF SLOT-VALUE) and SLOT-MAKUNBOUND in the specified fashion.\n\n## New in version 0.8.0, 2003-05-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * SBCL now builds using CLISP (version of late April 2003 from CVS) as cross-compilation host. As a consequence, we can now bootstrap our way up to SBCL starting with a bare gcc toolchain and human-readable source code (first the source to CLISP, then the source to SBCL).\n  * A contributed module containing a partial implementation of the simple-streams interface has been included. (thanks to Rudi Schlatte)\n  * A contributed module implementing the RFC1321 Message Digest Algorithm, known as MD5, has been included.\n  * minor incompatible change: The :NEGATIVE-ZERO-IS-NOT-ZERO feature no longer has any effect, as the code controlled by this feature has been deleted. (As far as we know, no-one has ever built using this feature, and its semantics were confused in any case).\n  * minor incompatible change: As a consequence of making SLOT-EXISTS-P work on conditions (as required by the ANSI specification), SLOT-VALUE, (SETF SLOT-VALUE) and SLOT-BOUNDP likewise have the expected behaviour on conditions. Users should note, however, that such behaviour is not required by the ANSI specification, and so use of this behaviour may render their code unportable.\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * the GENERIC-FUNCTION type is no longer disjoint from FUNCTION types.\n    * &ENVIRONMENT parameter in macro lambda list is bound first.\n    * SXHASH on condition objects no longer returns NIL.\n    * :ALLOCATION :CLASS slots are better treated; their values are updated on class redefinition, and initforms inherited from superclasses are applied.\n    * REMOVE-METHOD returns its generic function argument even when no method was removed.\n    * SHARED-INITIALIZE now initializes the values of the requested slots, including those with :ALLOCATION :CLASS.\n    * ALLOCATE-INSTANCE now works on structure classes defined via DEFSTRUCT (and not just by those from DEFCLASS :METACLASS STRUCTURE-CLASS).\n    * SLOT-EXISTS-P now works on conditions, as well as structures and CLOS instances.\n    * MAKE-LOAD-FORM now has the required methods on STRUCTURE-OBJECT, CONDITION and STANDARD-OBJECT.\n    * MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS no longer returns a special keyword, and now implements the SLOT-NAMES argument.\n    * methods with &OPTIONAL arguments no longer allow too many arguments to be passed in the call without error.\n    * DEFGENERIC now checks that the :ARGUMENT-PRECEDENCE-ORDER option is consistent with the required arguments of the generic function lambda list.\n  * bug fix: REQUIRE accepts a string designator. (Thanks to Antonio Martinez.)\n  * bug fix: SB-MOP:DIRECT-SLOT-DEFINITION-CLASS and SB-MOP:EFFECTIVE-SLOT-DEFINITION-CLASS now have the specified-by-AMOP lambda list of (CLASS &REST INITARGS).\n  * bug fix: The compiler now checks for duplicated variables in macro lambda lists.\n  * bug fix: SETQ on globals returns the correct value.\n  * fixed bug 47.d: (DEFGENERIC IF (X)) now signals a PROGRAM-ERROR, not a COMPILER-ERROR (followed by some other strange error on choosing the CONTINUE restart).\n  * bug fix: make.sh and friends are now more consistent in the way that they look for GNU \"make\".\n\n## New in version 0.8alpha.0, 2003-04-30\n\nBack to top\n\n  * experimental native threads support (on x86 Linux >=2.4 only). This is not compiled in by default: you need to add :SB-THREAD to the target features. See the \"Beyond ANSI\" chapter of the manual for details.\n  * fix for longstanding nonANSIism: The old distinction between CL:CLASS objects and SB-PCL:CLASS objects has been eliminated. The return value from CL:FIND-CLASS is now a CLOS class, and likewise that of CL:CLASS-OF; CL:BUILT-IN-CLASS, CL:STRUCTURE-CLASS and CL:STANDARD-CLASS name CLOS classes.\n  * An interface to the MetaObject Protocol, as described in Kiczales, des Rivieres and Bobrow's \"The Art of the Metaobject Protocol\", MIT Press, 1991, is available from the SB-MOP package.\n  * incompatible change: the SB-PCL package should now be considered a private implementation detail, and no longer a semi-private MOP interface.\n  * minor incompatible change: due to rearrangement for threads, the control stack and binding stack are now allocated at arbitrary addresses instead of being hardcoded per-port. Users affected by this probably have to be doing advanced things with shared libraries, and will know who they are.\n  * minor incompatible change: Previously, all --eval forms used were processed with READ before any of them were processed with EVAL. Now each --eval form is processed with both READ and EVAL before the next --eval form is processed. (Thus package operations like sbcl --eval \"(defpackage :foo)\" --eval \"(print 'foo::bar)\" now work as the user might reasonably expect.)\n  * minor incompatible change: *STANDARD-INPUT* is now only an INPUT-STREAM, not a BIDIRECTIONAL-STREAM. (thanks to Antonio Martinez)\n  * minor incompatible change: Y-OR-N-P is now character-oriented, not line oriented. Also, YES-OR-NO-P now works without errors. (thanks to Antonio Martinez)\n  * sb-aclrepl module improvements: an integrated inspector, added repl features, and a bug fix to :trace command.\n  * Known functions, which cannot be open coded by the backend, are considered to be able to check types of their arguments. (fixing a bug report by Nathan J. Froyd)\n  * fixed a bug in computing method discriminating functions: It is now possible to define methods specialized on classes which have forward-referenced superclasses. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * fixed evaluation order in optional entries (reported by Gilbert Baumann)\n  * SB-MOP:ENSURE-CLASS-USING-CLASS now takes its arguments in the specified-by-AMOP order of (CLASS NAME &REST ARGS &KEY).\n  * SB-MOP:COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-SLOT-DEFINITION now takes the required-by-AMOP NAME argument, as well as CLASS and DIRECT-SLOT-DEFINITIONS. (thanks to Kevin Rosenberg)\n  * fixed bug 20: DEFMETHOD can define methods using names that are not the proper names of classes to designate class specializers.\n  * bug fix: INTERACTIVE-STREAM-P now works on streams associated with Unix file descriptors, instead of blowing up. (thanks to Antonio Martinez)\n  * Garbage collection refactoring: user-visible change is that a call to the GC function during WITHOUT-GCING will not do garbage collection until the end of the WITHOUT-GCING. If you were doing this you were probably losing anyway.\n  * fixed bug in MEMBER type: (MEMBER 0.0) is not the same as (SINGLE-FLOAT 0.0 0.0), because of the existence of -0.0 which is TYPEP the latter but not the former.\n  * The compiler issues a full WARNING for calls to undefined functions with names from the CL package.\n  * MAP-INTO for a vector destination is open coded. (reported by Brian Downing on c.l.l)\n  * bug fix: the long form of DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION now accepts a documentation string.\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * COPY-ALIST now signals an error if its argument is a dotted list.\n    * Condition slots are now accessed more correctly in the presence of multiple initargs for a given slot.\n    * The USE-VALUE, CONTINUE and STORE-VALUE functions now correctly exclude restarts of the same name associated with a different condition.\n    * DEFCLASS of forward-referenced classes with another forward-referenced class in the superclasses list no longer causes an error.\n    * Condition slots are now initialized once each, not multiple times. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n    * CONVERT-MORE-CALL failed on a lambda list (&KEY). (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n    * &WHOLE and &REST arguments in macro lambda lists are patterns.\n    * NSET-EXCLUSIVE-OR does not return extra elements when its arguments contain duplicated elements.\n    * RESTART-CASE understands local macros.\n    * RESTART-CASE associates exactly its own restarts with a condition.\n    * ENDP in safe mode checks its argument to be of type LIST.\n    * COPY-SYMBOL in a threaded build no longer fails when the symbol in question is unbound.\n    * Optimized MAKE-INSTANCE functions no longer cause internal assertion failures in the presence of duplicate initargs.\n    * SLOT-MAKUNBOUND returns the instance acted upon, not NIL.\n    * Side-effectful :DEFAULT-INITARGS have their side-effects propagated even in the ctor optimized implementation of MAKE-INSTANCE.\n    * :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS NIL is now accepted in an initarg list.\n\n## New in version 0.7.14, 2003-03-24\n\nBack to top\n\n  * a better implementation of SXHASH on (simple) bit vectors, measured both in execution speed and in distribution of results over the positive fixnums, has been installed. Likewise, a better implementation of EQUAL for simple bit vectors is now available.\n  * fixed CEILING optimization for a divisor of form 2^k.\n  * fixed bug 240 (emitting extra style warnings \"using the lexical binding of the symbol *XXX*\" for &OPTIONAL arguments). (reported by Antonio Martinez)\n  * fixed SXHASH, giving different results for NIL depending on type declarations (SYMBOL or LIST). (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * fixed bug in DEFPARAMETER and DEFVAR: they could assign a lexical variable. (found by Rolf Wester)\n  * SBCL does not ignore type declarations for special variables. (reported by rif on c.l.l 2003-03-05)\n  * some bug fixes in contrib/sb-aclrepl/\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * a bug in the CONS type specifier, whereby the CAR and CDR types got intertwined, has been fixed;\n    * the type system is now able to reason about the interaction between INTEGER and RATIO types more completely;\n    * APPEND, [N]REVERSE and NRECONC check that those their arguments, which must be proper lists, are really so;\n    * An array specialized to be unable to hold elements has been implemented, as required -- yes, really -- by ANSI;\n    * GETF and GET-PROPERTIES throw a TYPE-ERROR, not a SIMPLE-ERROR, on malformed property lists;\n\n## New in version 0.7.13, 2003-02-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible packaging change: in line with Unix convention, SBCL now looks for its core file in /usr/{local/,}lib/sbcl/sbcl.core if it's not in $SBCL_HOME. It also sets SBCL_HOME to match.\n  * REQUIRE and PROVIDE are now optionally capable of doing something useful. See the documentation string for REQUIRE.\n  * infrastructure for a managed SBCL contrib system: contributed modules in this release include:\n\n    * the ASDF system definition facility;\n    * an interface to the BSD Sockets API;\n    * an ACL-like convenience interface to the repl; (thanks to Kevin Rosenberg)\n    * an implementation of ROTATE-BYTE, with efficient implementation on x86 hardware;\n  * fixed a bug in LOG, so that LOG of a rational argument near 1 now gives a closer approximation to the right answer than previously. (thanks to Raymond Toy)\n  * fixed bug 157: TYPEP, SUBTYPEP, UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE and UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE now take (ignored, in all situations) optional environment arguments, as required by ANSI.\n  * fixed bugs in other functions taking environment objects, allowing calls with an explicit NIL environment argument to be compiled without error.\n  * fixed bug 228: primary return values from FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION are either NIL or suitable for input to COMPILE or FUNCTION.\n  * fixed a bug in DEFSTRUCT: predicates for :NAMED structures with :TYPE will no longer signal errors on innocuous objects.\n  * fixed bug 231b: SETQ is better at respecting type declarations in the lexical environment.\n  * fixed a bug in DEFCLASS: classes named by symbols with no or unprintable packages can now be defined.\n  * fixed a bug in RESTART-BIND: The :TEST-FUNCTION option had been carelessly renamed to :TEST-FUN. (thanks to Robert E. Brown)\n  * fixed compiler failure related to checking types of functions. (reported by Robert E. Brown)\n  * the compiler is now much more consistent in its error-checking treatment of bounding index arguments to sequence functions: in (SAFETY 3) code, errors will be signalled in almost all cases if invalid sequence bounding indices are passed to functions defined by ANSI to operate on sequences.\n  * fixed a bug in the build procedure: documentation of SBCL-specific packages is now preserved and available in the final Lisp image.\n  * lifted FDEFINITION lookup out of loops in the implementation of many list operations. (thanks to Robert E. Brown)\n  * fixed a bug in the reader: the #n# reader macro now works for objects of type STANDARD-OBJECT. (reported by Tony Martinez)\n  * the compiler is now aware that SYMBOL-FUNCTION returns a FUNCTION and that READ-DELIMITED-LIST returns a LIST. (thanks to Robert E. Brown and Tony Martinez respectively)\n  * PCL is now smarter about SLOT-VALUE, (SETF SLOT-VALUE) and SLOT-BOUNDP: in particular, it is now able to optimize them much better, and is now not vulnerable to having packages renamed. Furthermore, a compliance bug has been fixed: SLOT-MISSING is now always called when a slot is not present in an instance. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * fixed a bug related to CONCATENATED-STREAMs: PEEK-CHAR will no longer signal an error on unreading a character following EOF on the previous constituent stream. (thanks to Tony Martinez)\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * ARRAY-IN-BOUNDS-P now allows arbitrary integers as arguments, not just nonnegative fixnums;\n    * the logical bit-array operators such as BIT-AND now accept an explicit NIL for their \"opt-arg\" argument (to indicate a freshly-consed result bit-array);\n    * ELT now signals an error on an invalid sequence index in safe code;\n    * the type system is now cleverer about negations of numeric types, and consequently understands the BIGNUM and RATIO types better;\n    * the type system is now cleverer about the interaction between INTEGER and RATIO types: while bugs still remain, many more cases are accurately computed;\n    * in TYPECASE, OTHERWISE now only introduces an otherwise-clause if it is in the last clause;\n    * CONSTANTLY now correctly returns a side-effect-free function in all cases;\n    * DECLARE is no longer treated as a special-operator; in particular, SPECIAL-OPERATOR-P no longer returns T for DECLARE;\n  * incremented fasl file version number due to the change in the DEFSTRUCT-SLOT-DESCRIPTION structure.\n\n## New in version 0.7.12, 2003-01-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: code processed by the \"interpreter\" or EVAL now has a compilation optimization policy of (DEBUG 2) (changed from (DEBUG 1)) to improve debuggability of interactive development, and to allow the use of the debug RETURN command in such code.\n  * an experimental implementation of the RETURN command for the debugger has been included. (thanks to Frederik Kuivinen)\n  * fixed bug 62: constraints were not propagated into a loop.\n  * fixed bug in embedded calls of SORT (reported and investigated by Wolfgang Jenkner).\n  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * printing and reading of arrays with some dimensions having length 0 (thanks to Gerd Moellmann);\n    * BOA constructor with &AUX argument without a default value does not cause a type error;\n    * CONSTANTP now returns true for all self-evaluating objects.\n\n## New in version 0.7.11, 2002-12-31\n\nBack to top\n\n  * fixed bug 127: DEFSTRUCT now does not clobber old structure accessors that are related by inheritance, as specified in the :CONC-NAME section of the specification of DEFSTRUCT. (thanks to Valtteri Vuorikoski)\n  * The compiler is now able to inline functions that were defined in a complex lexical environment (e.g. inside a MACROLET).\n  * fixed bug in DESCRIBE, which now works on rank-0 arrays. (thanks to Lutz Euler)\n  * Support for the upcoming FreeBSD-5.0 release has been included. (thanks to Dag-Erling Smorgrav)\n  * fixed bug 219: DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO no longer has compile-time effect when it is not in a toplevel context.\n  * fixed bug 222: DEFMETHOD and SYMBOL-MACROLET interactions now stand a better chance of being correct. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * fixed bug in COERCE, which now signals an error on coercing a rational to a bounded real type which excludes the expected answer.\n  * The compiler is now able to derive types more accurately from the COERCE and COMPILE functions.\n  * fixed bug 223: functional binding is considered to be constant only for symbols in the CL package.\n  * fixed bug 231: SETQ did not check the type of a variable being set (reported by Robert E. Brown)\n  * A new optimization for MAKE-INSTANCE has been included, fixing various bugs (including relating to :ALLOCATION :CLASS slots and :DEFAULT-INITARGS over-eager evalueation). (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * fixed some LOOP bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * As required by ANSI, LOOP now disallows anonymous collection clauses such as COLLECT I in conjunction with aggregate boolean clauses such as THEREIS (= I 1);\n    * LOOP now signals an error when any variable is reused in the same loop (including the potentially useful construct analogous to WITH A = 1 WITH A = (1+ A);\n    * IT is only a special loop symbol within the first clause of a conditional loop clause;\n    * LOOP with a typed iteration variable over a hashtable now signals a type error iff it should.\n  * fixed some other bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * FILE-STREAM now names the class previously known as FD-STREAM;\n    * in DEFSTRUCT, a bare :CONC-NAME (or a :CONC-NAME with no argument) no longer signals an error;\n    * likewise in DEFSTRUCT, :CONC-NAME NIL now respects the package of the slot symbol, rather than using the current package ((:CONC-NAME \"\") continues to intern the slot's name in the current package);\n  * incremented fasl file version number, because of the incompatible change to the DEFSTRUCT-DESCRIPTION structure, and again because of the new implementation of DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO.\n\n## New in version 0.7.10, 2002-11-27\n\nBack to top\n\n  * Support for building SBCL for MIPS platforms running in little-endian mode has now been checked in, and basic functionality on said platforms verified.\n  * minor incompatible change: PCL now records the pathname of a file in which methods and the like are defined, rather than its truename.\n  * minor incompatible change: TRUENAME now considers the truename of a file naming a directory to be the pathname with :DIRECTORY component indicating that directory.\n  * minor incompatible change: a NAMED clause in the extended form of LOOP no longer causes a BLOCK named NIL to surround the LOOP. The reason for the previous behaviour is unclear.\n  * more systematization and improvement of CLOS and MOP conformance in PCL (thanks to Gerd Moellman and Pierre Mai):\n\n    * the standard ANSI CL generic function NO-NEXT-METHOD is now implemented;\n    * DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION no longer signals an error for primary methods with no specializers;\n    * the MOP generic function GENERIC-FUNCTION-DECLARATIONS is now implemented;\n    * the Readers for Class Metaobjects methods CLASS-DIRECT-SLOTS and CLASS-DIRECT-DEFAULT-INITARGS have been implemented for FORWARD-REFERENCED-CLASSes; error reporting on CLASS-DEFAULT-INITARGS, CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST and CLASS-SLOTS has been improved;\n    * SXHASH on CLOS instances now uses a slot internal to the instance to return different numbers on distinct instances, while preserving the same return value through invocations of CHANGE-CLASS;\n    * DEFMETHOD signals errors when methods with longer incongruent lambda lists are added to generic functions;\n    * COMPUTE-CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST now has a method specialized on CLASS, as specified in AMOP;\n    * COMPUTE-SLOTS :AROUND now assigns locations sequentially based on the order returned by the primary method for classes of class STANDARD-CLASS;\n    * DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION now works with the :ARGUMENTS option.\n  * fixed some bugs shown by Paul Dietz' test suite:\n\n    * DOLIST puts its body in TAGBODY;\n    * SET-EXCLUSIVE-OR sends arguments to :TEST function in the correct order;\n    * MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ evaluates side-effectful places before value producing form;\n    * if more variables are given to PROGV than values, extra variables are bound and made to have no value;\n    * NSUBSTITUTE on list arguments gets the right answer with :FROM-END;\n    * ELT signals an error of type TYPE-ERROR when the index argument is not a valid sequence index;\n    * LOOP signals (at macroexpansion time) an error of type PROGRAM-ERROR when duplicate variable names are found;\n    * LOOP supports DOWNTO and ABOVE properly; (thanks to Matthew Danish)\n    * FUNCALL of special-operators now cause an error of type UNDEFINED-FUNCTION;\n    * PSETQ now works as required in the presence of side-effecting symbol-macro places;\n    * NCONC accepts any object as its last argument;\n    * :COUNT argument to sequence functions may be BIGNUM; (thanks to Gerd Moellman)\n    * loop-for-as-package does not require a package to be explicitely specified;\n    * LOOP WITH now treats NIL in the d-var-spec correctly as an ignored binding.\n  * fixed bug 166: compiler preserves \"there is a way to go\" invariant when deleting code.\n  * fixed bug 172: macro lambda lists with required arguments after &REST arguments now cause an error to be signalled. (thanks to Matthew Danish)\n  * fixed Entomotomy PEEK-CHAR-WRONGLY-ECHOS-TO-ECHO-STREAM bug. (thanks to Matthew Danish)\n  * fixed bug 225: STRING-STREAM is now a class. (reported by Gilbert Baumann)\n  * fixed bug 136: CALL-NEXT-METHOD no longer gets confused when arguments are lexically rebound. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann and Pierre Mai)\n  * fixed bug 194: error messages are now more informative when there is no primary method applicable in a call to a generic function. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * fixed bug in command line argument checking (thanks to Julian Fondren)\n  * fixed bug in COUNT-IF, making it handle :FROM-END correctly (thanks to Matthew Danish)\n  * incremented fasl file version number, because of the SXHASH-related changes in the layout of CLOS data structures\n\n## New in version 0.7.9, 2002-10-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * minor incompatible change: The runtime (the Unix executable named \"sbcl\") is now much pickier about the .core files it will load. Essentially it now requires .core files to descend from the same build (not just the same sources or LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION) as the runtime does. (The intent is to prevent the crashes which can occur, and which can even be reported as mysterious failures, when people patch the sources or change the build parameters without changing LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION, then mix and match sbcl and .core files.)\n  * fixed bug: VALUES-LIST is no longer optimized away.\n  * fixed bug 142: The FFI conversion of C string values to Lisp string values no longer conses excessively. (thanks to Nathan Froyd porting Raymond Toy's fix to CMU CL)\n  * began to systematize and improve MOP conformance in PCL (thanks to Nathan Froyd, Gerd Moellman and Pierre Mai):\n\n    * SLOT-DEFINITION-ALLOCATION now returns :CLASS, not the class itself;\n    * GENERIC-FUNCTION-ARGUMENT-PRECEDENCE-ORDER is now implemented;\n    * FINALIZE-INHERITANCE is now called on class finalization;\n    * DOCUMENTATION and (SETF DOCUMENTATION) now have the correct argument precedence order.\n  * fixed bug 202: The compiler no longer fails on functions whose derived types contradict their declared type.\n  * DEFMACRO is implemented via EVAL-WHEN instead of IR1 translation, so it can be non-toplevel.\n  * The fasl file version number has changed (because of the new implementation of DEFMACRO).\n  * (mostly) fixed bugs 46b and 46c: sequence functions now check, in safe code, that any length requirement by their type-specifier argument is valid. The exceptions to this are described in bug 213.\n  * fixed bugs 46h and 46i: TWO-WAY- and CONCATENATED-STREAM creation functions now check the types of their inputs as required by ANSI.\n  * fixed bug 48c: SYMBOL-MACROLET signals PROGRAM-ERROR when an introduced symbol is DECLAREd to be SPECIAL.\n  * fixed reading of (COMPLEX DOUBLE-FLOAT) literals from fasl files\n  * fixed bug: :COUNT argument to sequence functions may be negative\n  * fixed bug: body of DO-SYMBOLS may contain declarations\n  * fixed bug: PUSHNEW now evaluates its arguments from left to right (reported by Paul F. Dietz, fixed by Gerd Moellman)\n  * fixed bug: PUSH, PUSHNEW and POP now evaluate a place given by a symbol macro only once\n  * fixed printing of call frame when argument list is unavailable\n  * fixed bug: :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS is an allowed keyword name\n  * compiler no longer signals WARNING on unknown keyword :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS\n\n## New in version 0.7.8, 2002-09-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * A beta-quality port to the mips architecture running Linux, based on the old CMUCL backend, has been made. It has been tested on a big-endian kernel, and works sufficiently well to be able to rebuild itself; it has not been tested in little-endian mode.\n  * fixed an inconsistency between gencgc.c and purify.c which made dumping/loading .core files unreliable\n  * fixed bug 120a: The compiler now deals correctly with IFs where the consequent is the same as the alternative, instead of misderiving the return type. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)\n  * fixed bug 113: Logical pathnames are now dumpable (the logical host is resolved at load-time, throwing an error if it is not found).\n  * fixed bug 174: FORMAT's error message is slightly clearer when a non-printing character is used in a format directive.\n  * fixed several bugs in compiler checking of type declarations, i.e. violations of the Python \"declarations are assertions\" principle (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)\n  * fixed several bugs in PCL's error checking (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)\n  * fixed bug: printing of FILE-ERROR (thanks to Antonio Martinez-Shotton)\n  * fixed bug in compilation of functions as first class values (thanks to Antonio Martinez-Shotton)\n  * The compiler's handling TYPE-ERRORs which it can prove will inevitably happen at runtime has been cleaned up and corrected in several ways. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)\n  * improved argument type checking for various basic arithmetic operations (MAX, +, LOGXOR, etc.) which have had so much TLC lavished on them in the past that they can be compiled in many ways in different special cases\n  * fixed bug 181: compiler checks validity of user supplied type specifiers\n  * cleaned up code flushing in optimization: Function calls which should signal errors for safety purposes (e.g. which ANSI says should signal errors when their arguments are of incorrect type) are no longer optimized away.\n  * added new extension: SB-DEBUG:BACKTRACE-AS-LIST\n  * incremented fasl file version number, because changes in the implementation of sequence functions like COERCE caused internal utility functions like COERCE-TO-SIMPLE-VECTOR (used in old inline expansions) to become undefined. (Actually these changes were later undone, so we might very well be binary compatible with 0.7.7 after all, but leaving the version number incremented seemed like the simplest and most conservative thing to do.)\n\n## New in version 0.7.7, 2002-08-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * An alpha-quality port to the parisc architecture running Linux, based on the old CMUCL backend, has been made. This, even more so than the other backends, should be considered still a work in progress; known problems include that the Linux kernel in 64-bit mode does not propagate the correct sigcontext structure to userspace, and consequently SBCL on a parisc64 kernel will not work yet.\n  * fixed bug 189: The compiler now respects NOTINLINE declarations for functions declared in FLET and LABELS. (I.e. \"LET conversion\" is suppressed.) Also now that the compiler is looking at declarations in the environment, it checks optimization declarations as well, and suppresses inlining when (> DEBUG SPEED).\n  * More fixes have been made to treatment of floating point exception treatment and other Unix signals. In particular, floating point exceptions no longer cause Bus errors on the SPARC/Linux platform.\n  * The detection and handling of control stack exhaustion (infinite or very deeply nested recursion) has changed. Stack exhaustion detection is now done by write-protecting pages at the OS level and applies at all optimization settings; when found, a SB-KERNEL:CONTROL-STACK-EXHAUSTED condition (subclass of STORAGE-CONDITION) is signalled, so stack exhaustion can no longer be caught using IGNORE-ERRORS.\n  * Bugs 65, 70, and 109 fixed: The compiler now preserves invariants correctly when transforming recursive LABELS functions to LETs. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)\n  * Bug 48a./b. fixed: SYMBOL-MACROLET now refuses to bind symbols that are names of constants or global variables.\n  * Bug fix: DEFINE-ALIEN-ROUTINE now declaims the correct FTYPE for alien routines with docstrings.\n  * Bug 184 fixed: Division of ratios by the integer 0 now signals an error of type DIVISION-BY-ZERO. (thanks to Wolfhard Buss and Raymond Toy)\n  * Bug fix: Errors in PARSE-INTEGER are now of type PARSE-ERROR. (thanks to Eric Marsden)\n  * Bug fix: COERCE to (COMPLEX FLOAT) of rationals now returns an object of type (COMPLEX FLOAT). (thanks to Wolfhard Buss)\n  * Bug fix: The SPARC backend can now compile functions involving LOGAND and stack-allocated arguments. (thanks to Raymond Toy)\n  * Bug fix: We no longer segfault on passing a non-FILE-STREAM stream to a functions expecting a PATHNAME-DESIGNATOR.\n  * Bug fix: DEFGENERIC now enforces the ANSI restrictions on its lambda lists. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)\n  * Bug fix: changed encoding of PCL's internal MAKE-INSTANCE functions so that EXPORTing the name of the class doesn't cause MAKE-INSTANCE functions from earlier DEFCLASSes to get lost (thanks to Antonio Martinez for reporting this)\n  * Bug 192 fixed: The internal primitive DATA-VECTOR-REF can now be constant-folded without failing an assertion. (thanks to Einar Floystad Dorum for reporting this)\n  * Bugs 123 and 165 fixed: array specializations on as-yet-undefined types are now dealt with more correctly by the compiler.\n  * Minor incompatible change: COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME now merges its OUTPUT-FILE argument with its INPUT-FILE argument, resulting in behaviour analogous to RENAME-FILE. This puts its behaviour more in line with ANSI's wording on COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME. (thanks to Marco Antinotti)\n  * The fasl file version number has changed again. (because of the bug fix involving the names of PCL MAKE-INSTANCE functions)\n\n## New in version 0.7.6, 2002-07-23\n\nBack to top\n\n  * bug fix: Floating point exceptions are treated much more consistently on the x86/Linux and PPC/Linux platforms.\n  * Array initialization with :INITIAL-ELEMENT is now much faster for cases when the compiler cannot open code the array creation, but does know what the UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE will be. General array accesses have also seen a speed increase.\n  * bug fix: LOAD :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST NIL now works when file type is specified. (This was at the root of some bad interactions between SBCL and ILISP: thanks to Gregory Wright for diagnosing this and reporting the bug.)\n  * bug fix: Internal error arguments for undefined functions are now computed correctly on the PPC/Linux platform.\n  * bug fix: Bad &REST syntax is now checked correctly. (thanks to Raymond Toy's patch for CMU CL)\n  * Support for the Solaris 9 operating environment has been included (thanks to Daniel Merritt)\n  * A very ugly but hopefully complete draft of the missing FFI chapter of the manual has been created by reformatting the corresponding CMU CL manual chapter into (currently very ugly and incoherent) DocBook and bringing it up to date for SBCL behavior. Thus, the manual is now essentially complete, at least by my extreme once-and-only-once standards, whereby it's acceptable to refer to the doc strings of SB-EXT functions as the primary documentation.\n  * The fasl file version number has changed again, due to cleanup of (user-invisible) bitrotted stuff. (E.g. *!INITIAL-FDEFN-OBJECTS* is no longer a static symbol.)\n\n## New in version 0.7.5, 2002-06-23\n\nBack to top\n\n  * SBCL now builds with OpenMCL (version 0.12) as the cross-compilation host; also, more progress has been made toward bootstrapping under CLISP.\n  * SBCL now runs on the Tru64 (aka OSF/1) operating system on the Alpha architecture.\n  * bug 158 fixed: The compiler can now deal with integer loop increments different from 1; fixing this turned out also to fix bug 164.\n  * bug 169 fixed: no more bogus warnings about using lexical bindings despite the presence of perfectly good SPECIAL declarations (thanks to David Lichteblau)\n  * bug 175 fixed: CHANGE-CLASS is now more ANSI-conforming, accepting initargs. (thanks to Espen Johnsen and Pierre Mai)\n  * bug 179 fixed: DIRECTORY can now deal with filenames with pattern characters in them.\n  * bug 180 fixed: Method combination specifications no longer ignore the :MOST-SPECIFIC-LAST option. (thanks to Pierre Mai)\n  * bug fix: Structure type predicate functions now check their argument count as they should.\n  * bug fix: Classes with :METACLASS STRUCTURE-CLASS now print correctly. (thanks to Pierre Mai)\n  * minor incompatible change: The --noprogrammer option is deprecated in favor of the new --disable-debugger option, which is very similar. (The major difference is that it takes effect at a slightly different time at startup, causing handling of errors in --sysinit and --userinit files will be affected differently.) The SB-EXT:DISABLE-DEBUGGER and SB-EXT:ENABLE-DEBUGGER functions have been added to allow this functionality to be controlled from ordinary Lisp code. (ENABLE-DEBUGGER should help people like the Debian maintainers, who might want to run non-interactive scripts to build SBCL cores which will later be used interactively.)\n  * minor incompatible change: The LOAD function no longer, when given a wild pathname to load, loads all files matching that pathname. Instead, an error of type FILE-ERROR is signalled.\n\n## New in version 0.7.4\n\nBack to top\n\n  * bug 147 fixed: The compiler preserves its block link/count invariants more correctly now so that it doesn't crash. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)\n  * Dynamic loading of object files in OpenBSD is now supported. (thanks to Pierre Mai)\n  * COMPILE now works correctly on macros. (thanks to Matthias Hoelzl)\n  * GET-MACRO-CHARACTER and SET-MACRO-CHARACTER now represent no-value-for-this-character as NIL (as specified by ANSI).\n  * HOST-NAMESTRING on physical pathnames now returns a string that is valid as a host argument to MERGE-PATHNAMES and to MAKE-PATHNAME. (thanks to Christophe Rhodes)\n  * The Alpha port handles icache flushing more correctly. (thanks to Dan Barlow)\n  * More progress has been made toward bootstrapping under CLISP. (thanks to Christophe Rhodes)\n  * The fasl file format has changed again, because dynamic loading on OpenBSD (which has non-ELF object files) motivated some cleanups in the way that foreign symbols are transformed and passed around.\n  * minor incompatible change: The ASCII RUBOUT character, (CHAR-CODE 127), is no longer treated as whitespace by the reader, but instead as an ordinary character. Thus e.g. (READ-FROM-STRING \"AB\") returns |AB|, instead of A as it used to.\n\n## New in version 0.7.3\n\nBack to top\n\n  * ANSI's DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO is now supported. (thanks to Nathan Froyd porting CMU CL code originally by Douglas Thomas Crosher)\n  * SBCL now runs on the PPC archtiecture under Linux. It actually did this as of 0.7.1.45, but was left out of the previous news section (thanks to Dan Barlow)\n  * SBCL now runs on the Solaris operating system on SPARC architectures (thanks to Christophe Rhodes's port of the CMUCL runtime)\n  * cleanups to the runtime on SPARC, both Linux and Solaris, and for gcc>=3 (thanks to Nathan Froyd and Ingvar Mattsson)\n  * SPARC backend cleanups, allowing builds of cores optimized for V8 and V9 SPARCS, and also emission of code targeted to a particular backend chosen at runtime (thanks to Christophe Rhodes and Raymond Toy)\n  * SBCL is closer to bootstrapping under CLISP, thanks to various fixes by Christophe Rhodes.\n  * The fasl file format has changed again, to allow the compiler's INFO database to support symbol macros.\n  * The user manual (in doc/) is formatted into HTML more nicely. (thanks to coreythomas)\n  * The system is smarter about SUBTYPEP relationships, especially those involving NOT types (including types such as ATOM which are represented internally using NOT types). Thus SUBTYPEP is less likely to return (VALUES NIL NIL) in general, and in particular bugs 58 and (the remaining bits of) bug 50 are fixed. (thanks to Christophe Rhodes)\n  * The fasl file format has changed again, because the internal representation of types now includes a new slot to support the new SUBTYPEP-of-NOT-types logic.\n  * (not a change in the main branch of SBCL, but a related prototype which can hopefully be merged into the main branch of SBCL in the future:) Brian Spilsbury has produced a Unicode-enabled variant of sbcl-0.7.0, available as a patch against sbcl-0.7.0 at <http://designix.com.au/brian/SBCL/sbcl-0.7.0-unicode.p0.gz>.\n  * Bug 151 fixed: GET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHAR now returns NIL for undefined dispatch macro character combinations. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)\n  * Bugfix in PARSE-NAMESTRING: we now correctly parse unix namestrings that superficially look like logical namestrings correctly.\n  * USER-HOMEDIR-PATHNAME now returns a (physical) pathname that SBCL can deal with.\n  * Bugfix in DEFSTRUCT: BOA constructor lambda lists now accept (name default supplied-p) for &optional and &key arguments. (thanks to Martin Atzmueller)\n\n## New in version 0.7.2, 2002-03-24\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: The compiler is now less aggressive about tail call optimization, doing it only when (> SPACE DEBUG) or (> SPEED DEBUG). (This is an incompatible change because there are programs which relied on the old CMU-CL-style behavior to optimize away their unbounded recursion which will now die of stack overflow.)\n  * minor incompatible change: The default BYTES-CONSED-BETWEEN-GCS for non-GENCGC systems has been increased to 20M (since that seems much closer to the likely performance optimum for modern systems than the old 4M value was)\n  * minor incompatible change: new larger values for *DEBUG-PRINT-LENGTH* and *DEBUG-PRINT-LEVEL*\n  * SBCL runs on SPARC systems now. (thanks to Christophe Rhodes' port of CMU CL's support for SPARC, and various endianness and other SBCL portability fixes due to Christophe Rhodes and Dan Barlow)\n  * new syntactic sugar for the Unix command line: --load foo.bar is now an alternate notation for --eval '(load \"foo.bar\")'.\n  * bug fixes:\n\n    * The system now detects stack overflow and handles it gracefully, at least for (OR (> SAFETY (MAX SPEED SPACE)) (= SAFETY 3)) optimization settings. (This is a good thing in general, and its introduction in this version should be particularly timely for anyone whose code fails because of suppression of tail recursion!)\n    * The system now hunts for the C variable \"environ\" in a more devious way, to avoid segfaults when the C library version differs between compile time and run time. (thanks to Christophe Rhodes)\n    * INTEGER-valued CATCH tags now work. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka, and also to Christophe Rhodes for porting the fix to non-X86 CPUs)\n    * The compiler no longer issues bogus style warnings for undefined classes in the same source file as the DEFCLASSes which defined them. (thanks to Stig E Sandoe for reporting and Martin Atzmueller for fixing this)\n    * fixes in CONDITION class precedence list for undefined function errors (thanks to Alexei Dejneka)\n    * *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* is used more consistently and correctly. (thanks to Dan Barlow)\n    * portability fixes aiming at bootstrapping under CLISP (thanks to Dave McDonald and Christophe Rhodes)\n    * FORMAT fixes (thanks to Robert Strandh and Dan Barlow)\n    * fixes in type translation and and type inference (thanks to Christophe Rhodes)\n    * fixes to optimizer internal errors (thanks to Alexei Dejneka)\n    * various fixes in the new ports (thanks to Dan Barlow)\n  * several changes related to debugging:\n\n    * suppression of tail recursion, as noted above\n    * stack overflow detection, as noted above\n    * The default implementation of TRACE has changed. :ENCAPSULATE T is now the default. (For some time encapsulation has been more reliable than the breakpoint-based :ENCAPSULATE NIL implementation, at least on X86 systems; and I just noticed that encapsulation also seems closer to the spirit of the ANSI specification.)\n\n## New in version 0.7.1, 2002-01-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * mostly bug fixes:\n\n    * SB-ALIEN:LOAD-FOREIGN and SB-ALIEN:LOAD-1-FOREIGN are set up properly again. (There was a packaging bug in 0.7.0 which left their definitions in SB-SYS::LOAD-FOREIGN and SB-SYS::LOAD-1-FOREIGN. LOAD-FOREIGN and LOAD-1-FOREIGN are vital for most things which interface to C-level interfaces, like extensions working with sockets or databases or Perl-compatible regexes or whatever, and the need to fix this bug is the main reason that 0.7.1 was released so soon after 0.7.0.)\n    * DEFGENERIC is now choosier about the methods it redefines, so that reLOADing a previously-LOADed file containing DEFGENERICs does the right thing now. Thus, the Lispy edit/reLOAD-a-little/test cycle now works as it should. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)\n    * Bug 106 (types (COMPLEX FOO) where FOO is an obscure type) was fixed by Christophe Rhodes. (He actually submitted this patch months ago, and I delayed until after 0.7.0.)\n    * Bug 111 (internal compiler confusion about runtime checks on FUNCTION types) was fixed by Alexey Dejneka.\n  * Some internal cleanups (getting rid of variables which aren't needed now that the byte interpreter is gone) caused the fasl file format number to change again.\n\n## New in version 0.7.0, 2002-01-19\n\nBack to top\n\n  * major incompatible change: The default fasl file extension, i.e. the default extension for files produced by COMPILE-FILE, has changed to \".fasl\", for all architectures. (No longer \".x86f\" and \".axpf\".)\n  * compiler changes:\n\n    * There are many changes in the implementation of the compiler. SBCL is now essentially a compiler-only implementation of ANSI Common Lisp. EVAL still \"interprets\" a few special cases, but almost all the interesting cases are handled by creating a LAMBDA expression, calling COMPILE on it, then calling FUNCALL on the result.\n    * The EVAL-WHEN code has been rewritten to be ANSI-compliant, and various related bugs (IR1-1, IR1-2, IR1-3, IR1-3a) have gone away. Since the code is newer, there might still be some new bugs (though not as many as before Martin Atzmueller's fixes:-). But the new code is substantially simpler and clearer, and hopefully any remaining bugs will be simpler, less fundamental, and more fixable then the bugs in the old code.\n    * The revised compiler is still a little unsteady on its feet. In particular,\n\n      * The debugging information it produces (particularly the names of FUNCTION objects) is sometimes much less useful than what the old compiler produced.\n      * The support for inlining FOO when you (DECLAIM (INLINE FOO)) then do (DEFUN FOO ..) in a non-null lexical environment (e.g. within a MACROLET) has been temporarily weakened.\n    * There are new compiler optimizations for various functions:\n\n      * the sequence functions FIND, POSITION, FIND-IF, POSITION-IF, FIND-IF-NOT, POSITION-IF-NOT, and FILL\n      * the math functions TRUNCATE, FLOOR, and CEILING\n      * the function-of-all-trades COERCE Mostly these should be transparent, but there's one potentially-annoying problem (bug 117): when the compiler inline-expands a function and does type analysis on the result, it can create control paths which have type mismatches, and when it can't prove that those control paths aren't taken, it will issue WARNINGs about the type mismatches. This is a particular problem in practice for the new sequence functions. It's not clear how this should be fixed, and for now, a workaround is given in the entry for 117 in the BUGS file.\n    * (Because of the interaction between the two previous items -- occasional inlining problems and new inline expansions -- some of the new sequence function optimizations won't really kick in completely until debugging information, and then inlining, are straightened out in some future version.)\n  * minor incompatible changes:\n\n    * As part of a bug fix by Christophe Rhodes to DIRECTORY behavior, DIRECTORY no longer implicitly promotes NIL slots of its pathname argument to :WILD. In particular, when you ask for the contents of a directory (which you used to be able to do without explicit wildcards, e.g. (DIRECTORY \"/tmp/\")) you now need to use explicit wildcards, e.g. (DIRECTORY \"/tmp/*.*\").\n    * changes in behavior that ANSI explicitly defines to be implementation dependent:\n\n      * The new compiler-only implementation still conforms with ANSI, but acts a little different than before. Besides the obvious changes in performance tradeoffs (that the cost per form passed to EVAL has gone up, and the cost per form executed by EVAL has gone down), the behavior of the system changes a little because there are no longer any interpreted function objects. COMPILED-FUNCTION-P is now synonymous with FUNCTIONP, and e.g. doing COMPILE on the output of interactive DEFUN is now a no-op.\n      * The value of INTERNAL-TIME-UNITS-PER-SECOND has been increased from 100 to 1000.\n      * The default for the USE list in MAKE-PACKAGE and DEFPACKAGE has changed from (:CL) to NIL.\n      * The CHAR-NAME of unprintable ASCII characters which, unlike e.g. #\\Newline and #\\Tab, don't have names specified in the ANSI Common Lisp standard, is now based on their ASCII symbolic names (#\\Nul, #\\Soh, #\\Stx, etc.) The old CMU-CL-style names (#\\Null, #\\^a, #\\^b, etc.) are still accepted by NAME-CHAR, but are no longer used for output.\n    * changes in internal implementation constants:\n\n      * The default value of *BYTES-CONSED-BETWEEN-GCS* has doubled, to 4 million. (If your application spends a lot of time GCing and you have a lot of RAM, you might want to experiment with increasing it even more.)\n    * The SB-C-CALL package has been merged into the SB-ALIEN package. However, almost all old code should still continue to work without immediate update, as SB-C-CALL is now a (deprecated) nickname for SB-ALIEN.\n    * Old operator names in the style DEF-FOO are now deprecated in favor of new corresponding names DEFINE-FOO, for consistency with the naming convention used in the ANSI standard (DEFSTRUCT, DEFVAR, DEFINE-CONDITION, DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO..). This mostly affects internal symbols, but a few supported extensions like SB-ALIEN:DEF-ALIEN-FUNCTION are also affected. (So e.g. DEF-ALIEN-FUNCTION becomes DEFINE-ALIEN-FUNCTION.)\n    * The debugger prompt sequence now goes \"5]\", \"5[2]\", \"5[3]\", etc. as you get deeper into recursive calls to the debugger command loop, instead of the old \"5]\", \"5]]\", \"5]]]\" sequence. (I was motivated to do this when squabbles between ILISP and SBCL left me very deeply nested in the debugger. In the short term, this change will probably provoke more ILISP/SBCL squabbles, but hopefully it will be an improvement in the long run.)\n    * SB-ALIEN:DEFINE-ALIEN-FUNCTION (also known by the old deprecated name DEF-ALIEN-FUNCTION) now does DECLAIM FTYPE for the defined function, since declaiming return types involving aliens is (1) annoyingly messy to do by hand and (2) vital to efficient compilation of code which calls such functions.\n    * SB-ALIEN:LOAD-FOREIGN and SB-ALIEN:LOAD-1-FOREIGN are no longer reexported by the SB-EXT package. They're solely useful for alien code, so it seems more logical that you should get them from the SB-ALIEN package, not in SB-EXT.\n    * :SB-CONSTRAIN-FLOAT-TYPE, :SB-PROPAGATE-FLOAT-TYPE, and :SB-PROPAGATE-FUN-TYPE are no longer considered to be optional features. Instead, the code that they used to control is always built into the system.\n  * many other bug fixes\n\n    * DEFSTRUCT and DEFCLASS have been substantially updated to take advantage of the new EVAL-WHEN stuff and to clean them up in general, and they are now more ANSI-compliant in a number of ways. Martin Atzmueller is responsible for a lot of this.\n    * Besides the cleanups discussed above, Martin Atzmueller fixed several other bugs:\n\n      * fixes in READ-SEQUENCE and WRITE-SEQUENCE\n      * correct ERROR type for various file operations\n      * some fixes for Lisp streams\n      * DEFMETHOD syntax checking\n      * changing old weird representation of debug information as strings (which, among their other deficiencies, don't transform correctly when you rename packages, and don't change their print representation when you change things like *PACKAGE* and *PRINT-LENGTH*) to symbols and lists of symbols He also made several improvements and fixed several bugs in DESCRIBE.\n    * Alexey Dejneka fixed many bugs, including classic bugs and bugs he discovered himself:\n\n      * misbehavior of WRITE-STRING/WRITE-LINE\n      * LOOP over keys of a hash table, LOOP bugs 49b and 81 and 103, and several other LOOP problems as well\n      * DIRECTORY when similar filenames are present\n      * DEFGENERIC with :METHOD options\n      * bug 126, in (MAKE-STRING N :INITIAL-ELEMENT #\\SPACE))\n      * bug in the optimization of ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE\n      * argument ordering in FIND with :TEST option\n      * mishandled package designator argument in APROPOS-LIST\n      * various problems in the backquote readmacro\n      * a bug in APROPOS\n      * probably some others that I'm not describing very well here, since the CVS log documents them by reference to sbcl-devel messages, and the SourceForge archives aren't working well.:-(\n    * Dan Barlow improved the Alpha port (and is making progress on the PPC port, for those of you who think different).\n    * Besides the DIRECTORY fixes and changes mentioned elsewhere, Christophe Rhodes cleaned up the system self-test scripts (in tests/*), contributed the optimization of FIND-IF-NOT and POSITION-IF-NOT, and continues to work on the SPARC port (for those of you in a position to look down upon our little PC-compatible boxes from a great height).\n    * PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK now copies the *PRINT-LINES* value on entry and uses that copy, rather than the current dynamic value, when it's trying to decide whether to truncate output. Thus e.g. (let ((*print-lines* 50)) (pprint-logical-block (stream nil) (dotimes (i 10) (let ((*print-lines* 8)) (print (aref possiblybigthings i) stream))))) should now truncate the logical block only at 50 lines, instead of often truncating it at 8 lines, as it did before.\n  * The doc/cmucl/ directory, containing old CMU CL documentation from the time of the fork, is no longer part of the base system. SourceForge has shut down its anonymous FTP service, and with it my original plan for distributing the old CMU CL documentation there. For now, if you need these files you can download an old SBCL source release and extract them from it.\n  * The fasl file version number changed again, for dozens of reasons, some of which are apparent above.\n\n## New in version 0.6.13, 2001-08-06\n\nBack to top\n\n  * a port to the Compaq/DEC Alpha CPU, thanks to Dan Barlow\n  * Martin Atzmueller ported Tim Moore's marvellous CMU CL DISASSEMBLE patch, so that DISASSEMBLE output is much nicer.\n  * The code in the SB-PROFILE package now seems reasonably stable. I still haven't decided what the final interface should look like (I'd like PROFILE to interact cleanly with TRACE, since both facilities use function encapsulation) but if you have a need for profiling now, you can probably use it successfully with the current CMU-CL-style interface.\n  * Pathnames and *DEFAULT-DIRECTORY-DEFAULTS* are much more ANSI-compliant, thanks to various fixes and tests from Dan Barlow. Also, at Dan Barlow's suggestion, TRUENAME on a dangling symbolic link now returns the dangling link itself, and for similar reasons, TRUENAME on a cyclic symbolic link returns the cyclic link itself. (In these cases the old code signalled an error and looped endlessly, respectively.) Thus, DIRECTORY now works even in the presence of dangling and cyclic symbolic links.\n  * Compiler trace output (the :TRACE-FILE option to COMPILE-FILE) is now a supported extension again, since the consensus on sbcl-devel was that it can be useful for ordinary development work, not just for debugging SBCL itself.\n  * The default for SB-EXT:*DERIVE-FUNCTION-TYPES* has changed to NIL, i.e. ANSI behavior, i.e. the compiler now recognizes that currently-defined functions might be redefined later with different return types.\n  * Hash tables can be printed readably, as inspired by CMU CL code of Eric Marsden and SBCL code of Martin Atzmueller.\n  * better error handling in CLOS method combination, thanks to Martin Atzmueller porting Pierre Mai's CMU CL patches\n  * more overflow fixes for >16Mbyte I/O buffers\n  * A bug in READ has been fixed, so that now a single Ctrl-D character suffices to cause end-of-file on character streams. In particular, now you only need one Ctrl-D at the command line (not two) to exit SBCL.\n  * fixed bug 26: ARRAY-DISPLACEMENT now returns (VALUES NIL 0) for undisplaced arrays.\n  * fixed bug 107 (reported as a CMU CL bug by Erik Naggum on comp.lang.lisp 2001-06-11): (WRITE #*101 :RADIX T :BASE 36) now does the right thing.\n  * The implementation of some type tests, especially for CONDITION types, is now tidier and maybe faster, due to CMU CL code originally by Douglas Crosher, ported by Martin Atzmueller.\n  * Some math functions have been fixed, and there are new optimizers for deriving the types of COERCE and ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE, thanks to Raymond Toy's work on CMU CL, ported by Martin Atzmueller.\n  * (There are also some new optimizers in contrib/*-extras.lisp. Those aren't built into sbcl-0.6.13, but are a sneak preview of what's likely to be built into sbcl-0.7.0.)\n  * A bug in COPY-READTABLE was fixed. (Joao Cachopo's patch to CMU CL, ported to SBCL by Martin Atzmueller)\n  * DESCRIBE now gives more information in some cases. (Pierre Mai's patch to CMU CL, ported to SBCL by Martin Atzmueller)\n  * Martin Atzmueller and Bill Newman fixed some bugs in INSPECT.\n  * There's a new slam.sh hack to shorten the edit/compile/debug cycle for low-level changes to SBCL itself, and a new :SB-AFTER-XC-CORE target feature to control the generation of the after-xc.core file needed by slam.sh.\n  * minor incompatible change: The ENTRY-POINTS &KEY argument to COMPILE-FILE is no longer supported, so that now every function gets an entry point, so that block compilation looks a little more like the plain vanilla ANSI section 3.2.2.3 scheme.\n  * minor incompatible change: SB-EXT:GET-BYTES-CONSED now returns the number of bytes consed since the system started, rather than the number consed since the first time the function was called. (The new definition parallels ANSI functions like CL:GET-INTERNAL-RUN-TIME.)\n  * minor incompatible change: The old CMU-CL-style DIRECTORY options, i.e. :ALL, :FOLLOW-LINKS, and :CHECK-FOR-SUBDIRS, are no longer supported. Now DIRECTORY always does the abstract Common-Lisp-y thing, i.e. :ALL T :FOLLOW-LINKS T :CHECK-FOR-SUBDIRS T.\n  * Fasl file version numbers are now independent of the target CPU, since historically most system changes which required version number changes have affected all CPUs equally. Similarly, the byte fasl file version is now equal to the ordinary fasl file version.\n\n## New in version 0.6.12, 2001-05-05\n\nBack to top\n\n  * incompatible change: The old SB-EXT:OPTIMIZE-INTERFACE declaration is no longer recognized. I apologize for this, because it was listed in SB-EXT as a supported extension, but I found that its existing behavior was poorly specified, as well as incorrectly specified, and it looked like too much of a mess to straighten it out. I have enough on my hands trying to get ANSI stuff to work..\n  * many patches ported from CMU CL by Martin Atzmueller, with half a dozen bug fixes in pretty-printing and the debugger, and half a dozen others elsewhere\n  * fixed bug 13: Floating point infinities are now supported again. They might still be a little bit flaky, but thanks to bug reports from Nathan Froyd and CMU CL patches from Raymond Toy they're not as flaky as they were.\n  * The --noprogrammer command line option is now supported. (Its behavior is slightly different in detail from what the old man page claimed it would do, but it's still appropriate under the same circumstances that the man page talks about.)\n  * The :SB-PROPAGATE-FLOAT-TYPE and :SB-PROPAGATE-FUN-TYPE features are now supported, and enabled by default. Thus, the compiler can handle many floating point and complex operations much less inefficiently. (Thus e.g. you can implement a complex FFT without consing!)\n  * The compiler now detects type mismatches between DECLAIM FTYPE and DEFUN better, and implements CHECK-TYPE more correctly, and SBCL builds under CMU CL again despite its non-ANSI EVAL-WHEN, thanks to patches from Martin Atzmueller.\n  * various fixes to make the cross-compiler more portable to ANSI-conforming-but-different cross-compilation hosts (notably Lispworks for Windows, following bug reports from Arthur Lemmens)\n  * A bug in READ-SEQUENCE for CONCATENATED-STREAM, and a gross ANSI noncompliance in DEFMACRO &KEY argument parsing, have been fixed thanks to Pierre Mai's CMU CL patches.\n  * fixes to keep the system from overflowing internal counters when it tries to use i/o buffers larger than 16M bytes\n  * fixed bug 45a: Various internal functions required to support complex special functions have been merged from CMU CL sources. (When I was first setting up SBCL, I misunderstood a compile-time conditional #-OLD-SPECFUN, and so accidentally deleted them.)\n  * improved support for type intersection and union, fixing bug 12 (e.g., now (SUBTYPEP 'KEYWORD 'SYMBOL)=>T,T) and some other more obscure bugs as well\n  * some steps toward byte-compiling non-performance-critical parts of the system, courtesy of patches from Martin Atzmueller\n  * Christophe Rhodes has made some debian packages of sbcl at <http://www-jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/ftp/pub/debian/lisp>. From his sbcl-devel e-mail of 2001-04-08 they're not completely stable, but are nonetheless usable. When he's ready, I'd be happy to add them to the SourceForge \"File Releases\" section. (And if anyone wants to do RPMs or *BSD packages, they'd be welcome too.)\n  * new fasl file format version number (because of changes in internal representation of (OR ..) types to accommodate the new support for (AND ..) types, among other things)\n\n## New in version 0.6.11, 2001-02-25\n\nBack to top\n\n  * Martin Atzmueller pointed out that bugs #9 and #25 are gone in current SBCL.\n  * bug 34 fixed by Martin Atzmueller: dumping/loading instances works better\n  * fixed bug 40: TYPEP, SUBTYPEP, UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE, and UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE now work better with of compound types built from undefined types, e.g. '(VECTOR SOME-UNDEF-TYPE).\n  * DESCRIBE now works on structure objects again.\n  * Most function call argument type mismatches are now handled as STYLE-WARNINGs instead of full WARNINGs, since the compiler doesn't know whether the function will be redefined before the call is executed. (The compiler could flag local calls with full WARNINGs, as per the ANSI spec \"3.2.2.3 Semantic Constraints\", but right now it doesn't keep track of enough information to know whether calls are local in this sense.)\n  * Compiler output is now more verbose, with messages truncated later than before. (There should be some supported way for users to override the default verbosity, but I haven't decided how to provide it yet, so this behavior is still controlled by the internal SB-C::*COMPILER-ERROR-PRINT-FOO* variables in src/compiler/ir1util.lisp.)\n  * Fasl file format version numbers have increased again, because support for the Gray streams extension changes the layout of the system's STREAM objects.\n  * The Gray subclassable streams extension now works, thanks to a patch from Martin Atzmueller.\n  * The full LOAD-FOREIGN extension (not just the primitive LOAD-FOREIGN-1) now works, thanks to a patch from Martin Atzmueller.\n  * The default behavior of RUN-PROGRAM has changed. Now, unlike CMU CL but like most other programs, it defaults to copying the Unix environment from the original process instead of starting the new process in an empty environment.\n  * Extensions which manipulate the Unix environment now support an :ENVIRONMENT keyword option which doesn't smash case or do other bad things. The CMU-CL-style :ENV option is retained for porting convenience.\n  * LOAD-FOREIGN (and LOAD-1-FOREIGN) now support logical pathnames, as per Daniel Barlow's suggestion and Martin Atzmueller's patch\n\n## New in version 0.6.10, 2001-01-14\n\nBack to top\n\n  * A patch from Martin Atzmueller seems to have solved the SIGINT problem, and as far as we know, signal-handling now works cleanly. (If you find any new bugs, please report them!)\n  * The system no longer defaults Lisp source file names to types \".l\", \".cl\", or \".lsp\", but only to \".lisp\".\n  * The compiler no longer uses special default file extensions for byte-compiled code. (The ANSI definition of COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME seems to expect a single default extension for all compiled code, and there's no compelling reason to try to stretch the standard to allow two different extensions.) Instead, byte-compiled files default to the same extension as native-compiled files.\n  * Fasl file format version numbers have increased again, because a rearrangement of internal implementation packages made some dumped symbols in old fasl files unreadable in new cores.\n  * DECLARE/DECLAIM/PROCLAIM logic is more nearly ANSI in general, with many fewer weird special cases.\n  * Bug #17 (differing COMPILE-FILE behavior between logical and physical pathnames) has been fixed, and some related misbehavior too, thanks to a patch from Martin Atzmueller.\n  * Bug #30 (reader problems) is gone, thanks to a CMU CL patch by Tim Moore, ported to SBCL by Martin Atzmueller.\n  * Martin Atzmueller fixed several filesystem-related problems, including bug #36, in part by porting CMU CL patches, which were written in part by Paul Werkowski.\n  * More compiler warnings in src/runtime/ are gone, thanks to more patches from Martin Atzmueller.\n  * Martin Atzmueller pointed out that bug 37 was fixed by his patches some time ago.\n\n## New in version 0.6.9, 2000-11-28\n\nBack to top\n\n  * DESCRIBE now works on CONDITION objects.\n  * The debugger now handles errors which arise when trying to print *DEBUG-CONDITION*, so that it's less likely to fall into infinite regress.\n  * The build system now uses an additional file, customize-target-features.lisp, to allow local modifications to the target *FEATURES* list. (The point of this is that now I can set up a custom configuration, e.g. with :SB-SHOW debugging features enabled, without having to worry about propagating it into everyone's system when I do a \"cvs update\".) When no customize-target-features.lisp file exists, the target *FEATURES* list should be constructed the same way as before.\n  * fixed bugs in DEFCONSTANT ANSI-compatibility:\n\n    * DEFCONSTANT now tests reassignments using EQL, not EQUAL, in order to warn about behavior which is undefined under the ANSI spec. Note: This is specified by ANSI, but it's not very popular with programmers. If it causes you problems, take a look at the new SB-INT:DEFCONSTANT-EQX macro in the SBCL sources for an example of a workaround which you might use to make portable ANSI-standard code which does what you want.\n    * DEFCONSTANT's implementation is now based on EVAL-WHEN instead of on pre-ANSI IR1 translation magic, so it does the ANSI-specified thing when it's used as a non-toplevel form. (This is required in order to implement the DEFCONSTANT-EQX macro.)\n    * (DEFCONSTANT X 1) (DEFVAR X) (SETF X 2) no longer \"works\".\n    * Unfortunately, non-toplevel DEFCONSTANT forms can still do some funny things, due to bugs in the implementation of EVAL-WHEN (bug #IR1-3). This probably won't be fixed until 0.7.x. (Fortunately, non-toplevel DEFCONSTANTs are uncommon.)\n  * The core file version number and fasl file version number have been incremented, because the old noncompliant DEFCONSTANT behavior involved calling functions which no longer exist, and because I also took the opportunity to chop an unsupported slot out of the DEBUG-SOURCE structure.\n  * fixed bug 1 (error handling before read-eval-print loop starts), and redid debugger restarts and related debugger commands somewhat while doing so:\n\n    * The QUIT debugger command is gone, since it did something rather different than the SB-EXT:QUIT command, and since it never worked properly outside the main toplevel read/eval/print loop. Invoking the new TOPLEVEL restart provides the same functionality.\n    * The GO debugger command is also gone, since you can just invoke the CONTINUE restart directly instead.\n    * The TOP debugger command is also gone, since it's redundant with the FRAME 0 command, and since it interfered with abbreviations for the TOPLEVEL restart.\n  * The system now recovers better from non-PACKAGE values of the *PACKAGE* variable.\n  * The system now understands compound CONS types (e.g. (CONS FIXNUM T)) as required by ANSI. (thanks to Douglas Crosher's CMU CL patches, with some porting work by Martin Atzmueller)\n  * Martin Atzmueller reviewed the CMU CL mailing lists and came back with a boatload of patches which he ported to SBCL. Now that those have been applied,\n\n    * The system tries to make sure that its low-priority messages are prefixed by semicolons, to help people who like to use syntax highlighting in their ILISP buffer. (This patch was originally due to Raymond Toy.)\n    * The system now optimizes INTEGER-LENGTH better, thanks to more patches originally written by Raymond Toy.\n    * The compiler understands coercion between single-value and multiple-VALUES type expressions better, getting rid of some very weird behavior, thanks to patches originally by Robert MacLachlan and Douglas Crosher.\n    * The system understands ANSI-style non-KEYWORD &KEY arguments in lambda lists, thanks to a patch originally by Pierre Mai.\n    * The system no longer bogusly warns about \"abbreviated type declarations\".\n    * The compiler gets less confused by inlining and RETURN-FROM, thanks to some patches originally by Tim Moore.\n    * The system no longer hangs when dumping circular lists to fasl files, thanks to a patch originally from Douglas Crosher.\n  * Martin Atzmueller also fixed ROOM, so that it no longer fails with an undefined function error.\n  * gave up on fixing bug 3 (forbidden-by-ANSI warning for type mismatch in structure slot initforms) for now, documented workaround instead:-|\n  * fixed bug 4 (no WARNING for DECLAIM FTYPE of slot accessor function)\n  * fixed bug 5: added stubs for various Gray stream functions called in the not-a-CL:STREAM case, so that even when Gray streams aren't installed, at least appropriate type errors are generated\n  * fixed bug 8: better reporting of various PROGRAM-ERRORs\n  * fixed bug 9: IGNORE and IGNORABLE now work reasonably and more consistently in DEFMETHOD forms.\n  * removed bug 21 from BUGS, since Martin Atzmueller points out that it doesn't seem to affect SBCL after all\n  * The C runtime system now builds with better optimization and many fewer warnings, thanks to lots of cleanups by Martin Atzmueller.\n\n## New in version 0.6.8, 2000-10-26\n\nBack to top\n\n  * The system is now under CVS at SourceForge (instead of the CVS repository on my home machine).\n  * The new signal handling code has been tweaked to treat register contents as (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32), as the old CMU CL code did, instead of (SIGNED-BYTE 32), as the C header files have it. (Code downstream, e.g. in debug-int.lisp, has implicit dependencies on the unsignedness of integer representation of machine words, and that caused the system to bomb out with infinite regress when trying to recover from type errors involving signed values, e.g. (BUTLAST '(1 2 3) -1).)\n  * (BUTLAST NIL) and (NBUTLAST NIL) now return NIL as they should. (This was one of the bugs Peter Van Eynde reported back in July.)\n  * The system now uses code inspired by Colin Walters' O(N) implementation of MAP (from the cmucl-imp@cons.org mailing list, 2 September 2000) when it can't use a DEFTRANSFORM to inline the MAP operation, and there is more than one sequence argument to the MAP call (so that it can't just do ETYPECASE once and for all based on the type of the single sequence argument). (The old non-inline implementation of the general M-argument sequence-of-length-N case required O(M*N*N) time when any of the sequence arguments were LISTs.)\n  * The QUIT :UNIX-CODE keyword argument has been renamed to QUIT :UNIX-STATUS. (The old name still works, but is deprecated.)\n  * Raymond Wiker's patches to port RUN-PROGRAM from CMU CL to SBCL have been added.\n  * Raymond Wiker's patches to port dynamic loading from Linux to FreeBSD have been added.\n  * The BUGS file is now more nearly up to date, thanks in large part to Martin Atzmueller's review of it.\n  * The debugger now flushes standard output streams before it begins its output (\"debugger invoked\" and so forth).\n  * The core version number and fasl file version number have both been incremented, because of incompatible changes in the layout of static symbols.\n  * FINISH-OUTPUT is now called more consistently on QUIT. (It used to not be called for a saved Lisp image.)\n  * Martin Atzmueller's version of a patch to fix a compiler crash, as posted on sbcl-devel 13 September 2000, has been installed.\n  * Instead of installing Martin Atzmueller's patch for the compiler transform for SUBSEQ, I deleted the compiler transform, and transforms for some similar consing operations.\n  * A bug in signal handling which kept TRACE from working on OpenBSD has been fixed.\n  * added enough DEFTRANSFORMs to allow (SXHASH 'FOO) to be optimized away by constant folding\n  * The system now defines its address space constants in one place (in the Lisp sources), and propagates them automatically elsewhere (through GENESIS and the sbcl.h file). Therefore, patching the address map is less unnecessarily tedious and error-prone. The Lisp names of address space constants have also been systematized.\n  * CVS tags like dollar-Header-dollar have been removed from the sources, because they have never saved me trouble and they've been source of trouble working with patches and other diff-related operations.\n  * fixed the PROG1-vs.-PROGN bug in HANDLER-BIND (reported by ole.rohne@cern.ch on cmucl-help@cons.org 2000-10-25)\n\n## New in version 0.6.7\n\nBack to top\n\n  * The system has been ported to OpenBSD.\n  * The system now compiles with a simple \"sh make.sh\" on the systems that it's supported on. I.e., now you no longer need to tweak text in the target-features.lisp-expr and symlinks in src/runtime/ by hand, the make.sh takes care of it for you.\n  * The system is no longer so grossly inefficient when compiling code involving vectors implemented as general (not simple) vectors (VECTOR T), so code which dares to use VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND and FILL-POINTER, or which dares to use the various sequence functions on non-simple vectors, takes less of a performance hit.\n  * There is now a primitive type predicate VECTOR-T-P to test for the (VECTOR T) type, so that e.g. (DEFUN FOO (V) (DECLARE (TYPE (VECTOR T) V)) (AREF V 3)) can now be compiled with some semblance of efficiency. (The old code turned the type declaration into a full call to %TYPEP at runtime!)\n  * AREF on (VECTOR T) is still not fast, since it's still compiled as a full call to SB-KERNEL:DATA-VECTOR-REF, but at least the ETYPECASE used in DATA-VECTOR-REF is now compiled reasonably efficiently. (The old version made full calls to SUBTYPEP at runtime!)\n  * (MAKE-ARRAY 12 :FILL-POINTER T) is now executed less inefficiently, without making full calls to SUBTYPEP at runtime. (Some analogous efficiency issues for non-simple vectors specialized to element types other than T, or for non-simple multidimensional arrays, have not been addressed. They could almost certainly be handled the same way if anyone is motivated to do so.)\n  * The changes in array handling break binary compatibility, so *BACKEND-FASL-FILE-VERSION* has been bumped to 4.\n  * (TYPEP (MAKE-ARRAY 12 :FILL-POINTER 4) 'VECTOR) now returns (VALUES T) instead of (VALUES T T).\n  * By following the instructions that Dan Barlow posted to sbcl-devel on 2 July 2000, I was able to enable primitive dynamic object file loading code for Linux. The full-blown CMU CL LOAD-FOREIGN functionality is not implemented (since it calls ld to resolve library references automatically, requiring RUN-PROGRAM for its implementation), but a simpler SB-EXT:LOAD-1-FOREIGN (which doesn't try to resolve library references) is now supported.\n  * The system now flushes the standard output streams when it terminates, unless QUIT is used with the RECKLESSLY-P option set. It also flushes them at several other probably-convenient times, e.g. in each pass of the toplevel read-eval-print loop, and after evaluating a form given as an \"--eval\" command-line option. (These changes were motivated by a discussion of stream flushing issues on cmucl-imp in August 2000.)\n  * The source transform for TYPEP of array types no longer assumes that an array whose element type is a not-yet-defined type is implemented as an array of T, but instead punts, so that the type will be interpreted at runtime.\n  * There is now some support for cross-compiling in make.sh: each of the phases of make.sh has its own script. (This should be transparent to people doing ordinary, non-cross-compile builds.)\n  * Since my laptop doesn't have hundreds of megabytes of memory like my desktop machine, I became more motivated to do some items on my to-do list in order to reduce the size of the system a little:\n\n    * Arrange for various needed-only-at-cold-init things to be uninterned after cold init. To support this, those things have been renamed from FOO and *FOO* to !FOO and *!FOO* (i.e., all symbols with such names are now uninterned after cold init).\n    * Bind SB!C::*TOP-LEVEL-LAMBDA-MAX* to a nonzero value when building fasl files for cold load.\n    * Remove the old compiler structure pooling code (which used to be conditional on the target feature :SB-ALLOC) completely.\n    * Redo the representation of some data in cold init to be more compact. (I also looked into supporting byte compiled code at bootstrap time, which would probably reduce the size of the system a lot, but that looked too complicated, so I punted for now.)\n  * The maximum signal nesting depth in the src/runtime/ support code has been reduced from 4096 to 256. (I don't know any reason for the very large old value. If the new smaller value turns out to break something, I'll probably just bump it back up.)\n  * PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK is now pickier about the types of its arguments, as per ANSI.\n  * Many, many bugs reported by Peter Van Eynde have been added to the BUGS list; some have even been fixed.\n  * While enabling dynamic object file loading, I tried to make the code easier to understand, renaming various functions and variables with less ambiguous names, and changing some function calling conventions to be Lispier (e.g. returning NIL instead of 0 for failure).\n  * While trying to figure out how to do the OpenBSD port, I tried to clean up some of the code in src/runtime/. In particular, I dropped support for non-POSIX signal handling, added various comments, tweaked the code to reduce the number of compilation warnings, and renamed some files to increase consistency.\n  * To support the new automatic configuration functionality in make.sh, the source file target-features.lisp-expr has been replaced with the source file base-target-features.lisp-expr and the machine-generated file local-target-features.lisp-expr.\n  * fixed a stupid quoting error in make.sh so that using CMU CL \"lisp -batch\" as cross-compilation host works again\n\n## New in version 0.6.6\n\nBack to top\n\n  * DESCRIBE no longer tries to call itself recursively to describe bound/fbound values, so that it no longer fails on symbols which are bound to themselves (like keywords, T, and NIL).\n  * DESCRIBE now works on generic functions.\n  * The printer now prints less-screwed-up representations of closures (not naively trying to bogusly use the %FUNCTION-NAME accessor on them).\n  * A private symbol is used instead of the :EMPTY keyword previously used to mark empty slots in hash tables. Thus (DEFVAR *HT* (MAKE-HASH-TABLE)) (SETF (GETHASH :EMPTY *HT*) :EMPTY) (MAPHASH (LAMBDA (K V) (FORMAT T \"~&~S ~S~%\" K V))) now does what ANSI says that it should. (You can still get similar noncompliant behavior if bang on the hash table implementation with all the symbols you get back from DO-ALL-SYMBOLS, but at least that's a little harder to do.) This breaks binary compatibility, since tests for equality to :EMPTY are wired into things like the macroexpansion of WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR in FASL files produced by earlier implementations.\n  * There's now a minimal placeholder implementation for CL:STEP, as required by ANSI.\n  * An obscure bug in the interaction of the normal compiler, the byte compiler, inlining, and structure predicates has been patched by setting the flags for the DEFTRANSFORM of %INSTANCE-TYPEP as :WHEN :BOTH (as per Raymond Toy's suggestion on the cmucl-imp@cons.org mailing list).\n  * Missing ordinary arguments in a macro call are now detected even when the macro lambda list contains &KEY or &REST.\n  * The debugger no longer complains about encountering the top of the stack when you type \"FRAME 0\" to explicitly instruct it to go to the top of the stack. And it now prints the frame you request even if it's the current frame (instead of saying \"You are here.\").\n  * As specified by ANSI, the system now always prints keywords as #\\: followed by SYMBOL-NAME, even when *PACKAGE* is the KEYWORD package.\n  * The default initial SIZE of HASH-TABLEs is now smaller.\n  * Type information from CLOS class dispatch is now propagated into DEFMETHOD bodies, so that e.g. (DEFMETHOD FOO ((X SINGLE-FLOAT)) (+ X 123.0)) is now basically equivalent to (DEFMETHOD FOO ((X SINGLE-FLOAT)) (DECLARE (TYPE SINGLE-FLOAT X)) (+ X 123.0)) and the compiler can compile (+ X 123.0) as a SINGLE-FLOAT-only operation, without having to do run-time type dispatch.\n  * The macroexpansion of DEFMETHOD has been tweaked so that it has reasonable behavior when arguments are declared IGNORE or IGNORABLE.\n  * Since I don't seem to be making big file reorganizations very often any more (and since my archive of sbcl-x.y.zv.tar.bz2 snapshots is overflowing my ability to conveniently back them up), I've finally checked the system into CVS. (The CVS repository is on my home system, not at SourceForge -- putting it on SourceForge might come later.)\n  * SB-EXT:*GC-NOTIFY-STREAM* has been added, to control where the high-level GC-NOTIFY-FOO functions send their output. (There's still very little control of where low-level verbose GC functions send their output.) The SB-EXT:*GC-VERBOSE* variable now controls less than it used to -- the GC-NOTIFY-FOO functions are now under the control of *GC-NOTIFY-STREAM*, not *GC-VERBOSE*.\n  * The system now stores the version string (LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION) in only one place in the source code, and propagates it automatically everywhere that it's needed. Thus e.g. when I bump the version from 0.6.6 to 0.6.7, I'll only need to modify the sources in one place.\n  * The C source files now include boilerplate legalese and documentation at the head of each file (just as the Lisp source files already did).\n  * At Dan Barlow's suggestion, the hyperlink from the SBCL website to his page will be replaced with a link to his new CLiki service.\n\n## New in version 0.6.5\n\nBack to top\n\n  * Raymond Wiker's patches to port the system to FreeBSD have been merged.\n  * The build process now looks for GNU make under the default name \"gmake\", instead of \"make\" as it used to. If GNU make is not available as \"gmake\" on your system, you can change this default behavior by setting the GNUMAKE environment variable.\n  * Replace #+SB-DOC with #!+SB-DOC in seq.lisp so that the system can build without error under CMU CL.\n\n## New in version 0.6.4\n\nBack to top\n\n  * There is now a partial SBCL user manual (with some new text and some text cribbed from the CMU CL manual).\n  * The beginnings of a profiler have been added (starting with the CMU CL profiler and simplifying and cleaning up). Eventually the main interface should be through the TRACE macro, but for now, it's still accessed through vaguely CMU-CL-style functions and macros exported from the package SB-PROFILE.\n  * Some problems left over from porting CMU CL to the new cross-compilation bootstrap process have been cleaned up:\n\n    * DISASSEMBLE now works. (There was a problem in using DEFMACRO instead of SB!XC:DEFMACRO, compounded by an oversight on my part when getting rid of the compiler *BACKEND* stuff.)\n    * The value of *NULL-TYPE* was screwed up, because it was being initialized before the type system knew the final definition of the 'NULL type. This screwed up several key optimizations in the compiler, causing inefficiency in all sorts of places. (I found it because I wanted to understand why GET-INTERNAL-RUN-TIME was consing.)\n  * fixed a bug in DEFGENERIC which was causing it to overwrite preexisting PROCLAIM FTYPE information. Unfortunately this broke binary compatibility again, since now the forms output by DEFGENERIC to refer to functions which didn't exist in 0.6.3.\n  * added declarations so that SB-PCL::USE-CACHING-DFUN-P can use the new (as of 0.6.3) transform for SOME into MAP into inline code\n  * changed (MOD 1000000) type declarations for Linux timeval.tv_usec slot values to (INTEGER 0 1000000), so that the time code will no longer occasionally get blown up by Linux returning 1000000 microseconds\n  * PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT has been tweaked to make the spacing of its output conform to the ANSI spec. (Alas, this makes its output uglier in the :TYPE T :IDENTITY NIL case, but them's the breaks.)\n  * A full call to MAP NIL with a single sequence argument no longer conses.\n  * fixes to problems pointed out by Martin Atzmueller:\n  * The manual page no longer talks about multiprocessing as though it were currently supported.\n  * The ILISP support patches have been removed from the distribution, because as of version 5.10.1, ILISP now supports SBCL without us having to maintain patches.\n  * added a modified version of Raymond Toy's recent CMU CL patch for EQUALP comparison of HASH-TABLE\n\n## New in version 0.6.3\n\nBack to top\n\n  * The system still can't cross-compile itself with *TYPE-SYSTEM-INITIALIZED* (and all the consistency checks that entails), but at least it can compile more of itself that way than it used to be able to, and various buglets which were uncovered by trying to cross-compile itself that way have now been fixed.\n  * This release breaks binary compatibility again. This time at least I've incremented the FASL file format version to 2, so that the problem can be detected reliably instead of just causing weird errors.\n  * various new style warnings:\n\n    * using DEFUN, DEFMETHOD, or DEFGENERIC to overwrite an old definition\n    * using the deprecated EVAL/LOAD/COMPILE situation names in EVAL-WHEN\n    * using the lexical binding of a variable named in the *FOO* style\n  * DESCRIBE has been substantially rewritten. It now calls DESCRIBE-OBJECT as specified by ANSI.\n  * *RANDOM-STATE* is no longer automatically initialized from (GET-UNIVERSAL-TIME), but instead from a constant seed. Thus, the default behavior of the system is to repeat its behavior every time it's run. If you'd like to change this behavior, you can always explicitly set the seed from (GET-UNIVERSAL-TIME); whereas under the old convention there was no comparably easy way to get the system to repeat its behavior every time it was run.\n  * Support for the pre-CLTL2 interpretation of FUNCTION declarations as FTYPE declarations has been removed, in favor of their ANSI interpretation as TYPE FUNCTION declarations. (See p. 228 of CLTL2.)\n  * The quantifiers SOME, EVERY, NOTANY, and NOTEVERY no longer cons when the types of their sequence arguments can be determined at compile time. This is done through a new open code expansion for MAP which eliminates consing for (MAP NIL ..), and reduces consing otherwise, when sequence argument types can be determined at compile time.\n  * The optimizer now transforms COERCE into an identity operation when it can prove that the coerced object is already of the correct type. (This can be a win for machine generated code, including the output of other optimization transforms, such as the MAP transform above.)\n  * Credit information has been moved from source file headers into CREDITS.\n  * Source file headers have been made more standard.\n  * The CASE macro now compiles without complaining even when it has no clauses.\n\n## New in version 0.6.2\n\nBack to top\n\n  * (Note that the way that the PCL macroexpansions were rewritten to accommodate the change in DEFGENERIC below breaks binary compatibility. That is, fasl files compiled under sbcl-0.6.1 may not run under sbcl-0.6.2. Once we get out of alpha releases, i.e. hit release 1.0.0, we'll probably try to maintain binary compatibility between maintenance releases, e.g. between sbcl-1.4.3 and sbcl-1.4.4. Until then, however, it might be fairly common for maintenance releases to break binary compatibility.)\n  * A bug in the calculation of WARNINGS-P and FAILURE-P in COMPILE-FILE has been fixed.\n  * The reporting of unhandled signals has been changed to print some explanatory text as well as the report form. (Previously only the report form was printed.)\n  * The macroexpansion for DEFGENERIC now DECLAIMs the function that it defines, so that the compiler no longer issues undefined function warnings for compiled-but-not-yet-loaded generic functions.\n  * The CLTL-style \"LISP\" and \"USER\" nicknames for the \"COMMON-LISP\" and \"COMMON-LISP-USER\" packages have been removed. Now only the \"CL\" and \"CL-USER\" standard nicknames from the \"11.1.2 Standardized Packages\" section of the ANSI spec are supported.\n  * The \"\" nickname for the \"KEYWORD\" package has been removed. The reader still handles symbol tokens which begin with a package marker as keywords, but it doesn't expose its mechanism for doing so in the (PACKAGE-NICKNAMES (FIND-PACKAGE \"KEYWORD\")) list.\n  * The system now issues STYLE-WARNINGs for contradictory TYPE proclamations. (Warnings for contradictory FTYPE proclamations would be nice too, but those can't be done usefully unless the type system is made smarter about FUNCTION types.)\n  * The names of source files \"*host-*.lisp\" and \"*target-*.lisp\" have been systematized, so that \"*target-*.lisp is supposed to exist only on the target and imply that there's a related file which exists on the host, and *host-*.lisp is supposed to exist only on the host and imply that there's a related file which exists on the target. This involves a lot of renaming. Hopefully the acute confusion caused by the renaming will be justified by the reduction in chronic confusion..\n\n    * runtime-type.lisp -> early-target-type.lisp\n    * target-type.lisp -> late-target-type.lisp\n    * early-host-format.lisp -> early-format.lisp\n    * late-host-format.lisp -> late-format.lisp\n    * host-error.lisp -> misc-error.lisp\n    * early-error.lisp -> early-target-error.lisp\n    * late-error.lisp -> late-target-error.lisp\n    * host-defboot.lisp -> early-defboot.lisp\n    * code/misc.lisp -> code/target-misc.lisp\n    * code/host-misc.lisp -> code/misc.lisp\n    * code/numbers.lisp -> code/target-numbers.lisp\n    * code/early-numbers.lisp -> numbers.lisp\n    * early-host-type.lisp -> early-type.lisp\n    * late-host-type.lisp -> late-type.lisp\n    * host-typep.lisp -> typep.lisp\n    * load.lisp -> target-load.lisp\n    * host-load.lisp -> load.lisp\n    * host-disassem.lisp -> disassem.lisp\n    * host-insts.lisp -> insts.lisp\n    * byte-comp.lisp -> target-byte-comp.lisp\n    * host-byte-comp.lisp -> byte-comp.lisp\n    * host-signal.lisp -> signal.lisp\n    * host-defstruct.lisp -> defstruct.lisp\n    * late-target-type.lisp -> deftypes-for-target.lisp Furthermore, several other previously target-only files foo.lisp (e.g. hash-table.lisp and random.lisp) have been split into a target-and-host foo.lisp file and a target-only target-foo.lisp file, with their key type definitions in the target-and-host part, so that the cross-compiler will know more about target types.\n  * DEFSTRUCT BACKEND, and the BACKEND-valued *BACKEND* variable, have gone away. In their place are various *BACKEND-FOO* variables corresponding to the slots of the old structure.\n  * A bug which caused the SB-COLD bootstrap-time package to be propagated into the target SBCL has been fixed.\n  * The chill.lisp system for loading cold code into a running SBCL now works better.\n  * Support for the CMU CL \"scavenger hook\" extension has been removed. (It was undocumented and unused in the CMU CL sources that SBCL was derived from, and stale in sbcl-0.6.1.)\n  * Various errors in the cross-compiler type system were detected by running the cross-compiler with *TYPE-SYSTEM-INITIALIZED* (enabling various consistency checks). Many of them were fixed, but some hard problems remain, so the compiler is back to running without *TYPE-SYSTEM-INITIALIZED* for now.\n  * As part of the cross-compiler type system cleanup, I implemented DEF!TYPE and got rid of early-ugly-duplicates.lisp.\n  * I have started adding UNCROSS calls throughout the type system and the INFO database. (Thus perhaps eventually the blanket UNCROSS on cross-compiler input files will be able to go away, and various kludges with it).\n  * CONSTANTP now returns true for quoted forms (as explicitly required by the ANSI spec).\n\n## New in version 0.6.1\n\nBack to top\n\n  * changed build optimization from (SAFETY 1) to (SAFETY 3) as a short-term fix for various type-unsafety bugs, e.g. failures with (LENGTH 123) and (MAKE-LIST -1). In the longer term, it ought to become true that declarations are assertions even at SAFETY 1. For now, it's not quite true even at SAFETY 3, but it's at least more nearly true.. (Note that this change seems to increases the size of the system by O(5%) and to decrease the speed of the compiler by 20% or more.)\n  * changed ALIEN printing to be much more abbreviated, as a short-term fix for the problem of printing dozens of lines of distracting information about low-level system machinery as part of the top stack frame on entry to the debugger when an undefined function was called.\n  * tweaked the debugger's use of WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX so that *PACKAGE* is not reset to COMMON-LISP-USER.\n  * Compilation of stuff related to dyncount.lisp has been made conditional on the :SB-DYNCOUNT target feature, so that the ordinary core system is smaller. The various dyncount-related symbols have been moved into a new \"SB-DYNCOUNT\" package.\n  * tty-inspect.lisp has been renamed to inspect.lisp.\n  * unix-glibc2.lisp has been renamed to unix.lisp, and the :GLIBC2 feature has gone away. (When we eventually port to other flavors of libc and/or Unix, we'll try to make the differences between flavors invisible at the user level.)\n  * Various other *FEATURES* tags, and/or their associated conditionals, have been removed if obsolescent, or given better documentation, or sometimes given more-mnemonic names.\n\n## New in version 0.6.0\n\nBack to top\n\n  * tidied up \"make.sh\" script\n  * tidied up system directory structure\n  * better \"clean.sh\" behavior\n  * added doc/FOR-CMUCL-DEVELOPERS\n  * many many small tweaks to output format, e.g. removing possibly-confusing trailing #\\\\. character in DESCRIBE-INSTANCE\n  * (EQUALP #\\A 'A) no longer signals an error.\n  * new hashing code, including EQUALP hashing\n  * tidied up Lisp initialization and toplevel\n  * initialization files (e.g. /etc/sbclrc and $HOME/.sbclrc)\n  * command line argument processing\n  * added POSIX-GETENV function to deal with Unix-ish environment variables\n  * more-Unixy handling of *STANDARD-INPUT* and other Lisp streams, e.g. terminating SBCL on EOF\n  * non-verbose GC by default\n  * There is no more \"sbcl\" shell script; the sbcl file is now the C runtime executable (just like CMU CL).\n  * removed some unused fops, e.g. FOP-UNIFORM-VECTOR, FOP-CHARACTER, and FOP-POP-FOR-EFFECT\n  * tweaked debug-info.lisp and debug-int.lisp to make the debugger store symbol and package information as Lisp native symbol and package objects instead of strings naming symbols and strings naming packages. This way, whenever packages are renamed (as in warm init), debug information is transformed along with everything else.\n  * tweaked the optimization policy declarations which control the building of SBCL itself. Now, among other things, the system no longer saves source location debugging information. (This helps two problems at once by reducing SBCL size and by keeping SBCL from trying to look for its sources -- which may not exist -- when reporting errors.)\n  * added src/cold/chill.lisp, to let SBCL read its own cold sources for debugging and testing purposes\n  * cleaned up printing, making the printer call PRINT-OBJECT for instances, and using PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT for most PRINT-OBJECT methods, giving nearly-ANSI behavior\n  * converted almost all special variables to use *FOO* naming convention\n  * deleted PARSE-TIME functionality, since it can be done portably\n  * moved some files out of cold init into warm init\n  * deleted DEFUN UNDEFINED-VALUE, replaced (UNDEFINED-VALUE) forms with (VALUES) forms\n  * regularized formatting of source files\n  * added an install.sh script\n  * fixed ridiculous memory usage of cross-compiler by making compiler/alloc.lisp not try to do pooling unless it can hook itself into the GC of the cross-compilation host. Now the system builds nicely on my old laptop.\n  * added :SB-ALLOC in target-features.lisp-expr\n  * deleted mention of :ANSI-DOC from target-features.lisp-expr (since it was not implemented)\n  * re-did condition handling and note reporting in the compiler. Notes are no longer handled by signalling conditions. Style warnings and warnings are handled more correctly and reported in such a way that it's easy to find one or the other in your output (so that you can e.g. figure out which of many problems caused COMPILE-FILE to return FAILURE-P).\n  * changed the severity of several compiler warnings from full WARNING to STYLE-WARNING in order to conform with the ANSI spec; also changed compiler note reporting so that it doesn't use the condition system at all (and hence affects neither FAILURE-P nor WARNINGS-P in the COMPILE-FILE command)\n  * made PROCLAIM and DECLAIM conform to ANSI. PROCLAIM is now an ordinary function. As a consequence, START-BLOCK and END-BLOCK declarations are no longer supported, since their implementation was deeply intertwingled with the magical, non-ANSI treatment that PROCLAIM received in CMU CL.\n  * removed bogus \"support\" for compiler macros named (SETF FOO), and removed the compiler macro for SETF INFO (but only after making a fool of myself on the cmucl-imp mailing list by posting a bogus patch for DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO..)\n  * Compiled files containing forms which have side effects on the Lisp reader (such as DEFPACKAGE forms) are now handled more correctly. (Compiler queuing of top level lambdas has been suppressed by setting *TOP-LEVEL-LAMBDA-MAX* to 0. )\n  * deleted various currently-unused source files, e.g. gengc.lisp. They may be added back at some point e.g. when porting to other architectures, but until they are it's distracting to distribute them and to try to maintain them.\n  * deleted \"UNCROSS couldn't recurse through..\" style warnings, since there were so many of them they're just distractions, and UNCROSS is known to be able to handle the current sources\n  * moved PROFILE functionality into TRACE, so that it will be clear how the wrapping and unwrapping of functions when you profile them interacts with the wrapping and unwrapping of functions when you trace them. (Actually, the functionality isn't there yet, but at least the interface specification is there. Hopefully, the functionality will arrive with some future maintenance release.)\n  * removed host-oops.lisp\n  * changed signature of QUIT function to allow UNIX-CODE argument\n  * fixed READ-SEQUENCE bug\n  * tweaked verbose GC output so that it looks more like the progress output that ANSI specifies for functions like LOAD\n  * set up the system on sourceforge.com, with home pages, mailing lists, etc.\n  * added <http://sbcl.sourceforge.com> to the banner information printed by the sbcl executable\n\n", "frontpage": false}
