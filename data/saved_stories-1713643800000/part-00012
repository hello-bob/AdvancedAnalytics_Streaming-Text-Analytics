Back in 2022, the space launch operator added a new subsidiary called\nStarshield to develop an additional orbital fleet designed for government use.\n\nThis is built with the same basic technology as its Starlink constellation\nthat provides consumer broadband services from low Earth orbit, but with extra\ncapabilities focused on three areas; Earth observation, communications, and\nhosted payloads.\n\nIt is understood that Starshield is the subsidiary working with Northrop\nGrumman, which is said to be involved because Washington wants to avoid\nputting too much control of a highly sensitive intelligence program in the\nhands of one contractor. Especially a contractor whose owner is known to be\nunpredictable and - at times - petulant, we suspect.\n\n  * Starlink clashes with Telecom Italia over frequency data sharing\n  * The last mile's at risk in our hostile environment. Let\u2019s go the extra mile to fix it\n  * Is Russia using Starlink in Ukraine? Congress demands answers\n  * Square Kilometre Array precursor looks to filter out satellite interference\n\nNorthrop Grumman is reportedly providing the sensor payloads for the\nsatellites, with imaging features designed to offer superior clarity when\ncompared to existing intelligence gathering systems. It is unclear if other\ncontractors are also involved in the project.\n\nEarlier this month, the US Space Force (USSF) unveiled a strategy focused on\nmaking the most of the operational capability and capacity offered by\nAmerica\u2019s commercial space sector in order to stay ahead of opponents such as\nRussia and China.\n\nHowever, this situation could be risky for SpaceX, which could see its space\nhardware come to be regarded as a legitimate target by adversaries such as\nRussia and China.\n\nBack in 2022, Russia accused the US of \"provocative use of civilian\nsatellites\" over the deployment of Starlink to aid Ukraine, and warned the\nUnited Nations that commercial space systems were at risk of becoming military\nobjects for retaliation.\n\nChina has also hit back at the latest news. The official newspaper of China\u2019s\nmilitary has accused the US of \u201cmilitarising space,\u201d and said that the\nStarshield satellite constellation \u201cposed huge challenges to information and\nspace asset security of other countries,\u201d according to South China Morning\nPost.\n\nThe Starshield project would allow the US government and military to \u201cquickly\nspot potential targets almost anywhere on the globe,\u201d it complained.\n\nRussia and China are both believed to have anti-satellite weapon systems.\nWashington accused Moscow of developing a \"troubling\" new anti-satellite\nweapon earlier this year, while USSF chief General Chance Salzman highlighted\nthe danger posed by China\u2019s anti-satellite (ASAT) missile tech last year. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Military\n  * SpaceX\n  * United States Armed Forces\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Military\n  * SpaceX\n  * United States Armed Forces\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * F-35\n  * Starlink\n  * United States Navy\n  * United States Space Force\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Aerospace\n  * Elon Musk\n  * United States of America\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Military\n  * SpaceX\n  * United States Armed Forces\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Military\n  * SpaceX\n  * United States Armed Forces\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * F-35\n  * Starlink\n  * United States Navy\n  * United States Space Force\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Aerospace\n  * Elon Musk\n  * United States of America\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Space Force boss warns 'the US will lose' without help from Musk and\nBezos\n\nChina, Russia have muscled up, and whoever wins up there wins down here\n\nSecurity9 days | 41\n\n#### US Air Force says AI-controlled F-16 fighter jet has been dogfighting\nwith humans\n\nVideo Robo-plane was made to restrain itself so as not to harm pilot or\nairframe\n\nAI + ML2 days | 56\n\n#### China scientists talk of powering hypersonic weapon with cheap Nvidia\nchip\n\nAnalysis Jetson module can efficiently process computational fluid dynamics\nmodels\n\nSystems4 days | 5\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### US Air Force secretary so confident in AI-controlled F-16s, he'll fly in\none\n\nWith a pilot as backup of course \u2013 VENOM is still emerging tech\n\nAI + ML10 days | 34\n\n#### Psst, hey.
