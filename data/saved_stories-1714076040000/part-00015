I am, in a way,\nabout to live forever, thanks to the AI video startup Synthesia. For the past\nseveral years, the company has produced AI-generated avatars, but today it\nlaunches a new generation, its first to take advantage of the latest\nadvancements in generative AI, and they are more realistic and expressive than\nanything I\u2019ve ever seen. While today\u2019s release means almost anyone will now be\nable to make a digital double, on this early April afternoon, before the\ntechnology goes public, they\u2019ve agreed to make one of me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally arrive at the company\u2019s stylish studio in East London, I am\ngreeted by Tosin Oshinyemi, the company\u2019s production lead. He is going to\nguide and direct me through the data collection process\u2014and by \u201cdata\ncollection,\u201d I mean the capture of my facial features, mannerisms, and\nmore\u2014much like he normally does for actors and Synthesia\u2019s customers.\n\nIn this AI-generated footage, synthetic \"Melissa\" gives a performance of\nHamlet's famous soliloquy.\n\nSYNTHESIA\n\nHe introduces me to a waiting stylist and a makeup artist, and I curse myself\nfor wasting so much time getting ready. Their job is to ensure that people\nhave the kind of clothes that look good on camera and that they look\nconsistent from one shot to the next. The stylist tells me my outfit is fine\n(phew), and the makeup artist touches up my face and tidies my baby hairs. The\ndressing room is decorated with hundreds of smiling Polaroids of people who\nhave been digitally cloned before me.\n\nApart from the small supercomputer whirring in the corridor, which processes\nthe data generated at the studio, this feels more like going into a news\nstudio than entering a deepfake factory.\n\nI joke that Oshinyemi has what MIT Technology Review might call a job title of\nthe future: \u201cdeepfake creation director.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe like the term \u2018synthetic media\u2019 as opposed to \u2018deepfake,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle but, some would argue, notable difference in semantics. Both\nmean AI-generated videos or audio recordings of people doing or saying\nsomething that didn\u2019t necessarily happen in real life. But deepfakes have a\nbad reputation. Since their inception nearly a decade ago, the term has come\nto signal something unethical, says Alexandru Voica, Synthesia\u2019s head of\ncorporate affairs and policy. Think of sexual content produced without\nconsent, or political campaigns that spread disinformation or propaganda.\n\n\u201cSynthetic media is the more benign, productive version of that,\u201d he argues.\nAnd Synthesia wants to offer the best version of that version.\n\nUntil now, all AI-generated videos of people have tended to have some\nstiffness, glitchiness, or other unnatural elements that make them pretty easy\nto differentiate from reality. Because they\u2019re so close to the real thing but\nnot quite it, these videos can make people feel annoyed or uneasy or icky\u2014a\nphenomenon commonly known as the uncanny valley. Synthesia claims its new\ntechnology will finally lead us out of the valley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Related Story\n\nThe viral AI avatar app Lensa undressed me\u2014without my consent\n\nMy avatars were cartoonishly pornified, while my male colleagues got to be\nastronauts, explorers, and inventors.\n\nThanks to rapid advancements in generative AI and a glut of training data\ncreated by human actors that has been fed into its AI model, Synthesia has\nbeen able to produce avatars that are indeed more humanlike and more\nexpressive than their predecessors. The digital clones are better able to\nmatch their reactions and intonation to the sentiment of their scripts\u2014acting\nmore upbeat when talking about happy things, for instance, and more serious or\nsad when talking about unpleasant things. They also do a better job matching\nfacial expressions\u2014the tiny movements that can speak for us without words.\n\nBut this technological progress also signals a much larger social and cultural\nshift. Increasingly, so much of what we see on our screens is generated (or at\nleast tinkered with) by AI, and it is becoming more and more difficult to\ndistinguish what is real from what is not. This threatens our trust in\neverything we see, which could have very real, very dangerous consequences.\n\n\u201cI think we might just have to say goodbye to finding out about the truth in a\nquick way,\u201d says Sandra Wachter, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute,\nwho researches the legal and ethical implications of AI. \u201cThe idea that you\ncan just quickly Google something and know what\u2019s fact and what\u2019s fiction\u2014I\ndon\u2019t think it works like that anymore.\u201d\n\nTosin Oshinyemi, the company\u2019s production lead, guides and directs actors and\ncustomers through the data collection process.\n\nDAVID VINTINER\n\nSo while I was excited for Synthesia to make my digital double, I also\nwondered if the distinction between synthetic media and deepfakes is\nfundamentally meaningless. Even if the former centers a creator\u2019s intent and,\ncritically, a subject\u2019s consent, is there really a way to make AI avatars\nsafely if the end result is the same? And do we really want to get out of the\nuncanny valley if it means we can no longer grasp the truth?\n\nBut more urgently, it was time to find out what it\u2019s like to see a post-truth\nversion of yourself.\n\n### Almost the real thing\n\nA month before my trip to the studio, I visited Synthesia CEO Victor\nRiparbelli at his office near Oxford Circus. As Riparbelli tells it,\nSynthesia\u2019s origin story stems from his experiences exploring avant-garde,\ngeeky techno music while growing up in Denmark. The internet allowed him to\ndownload software and produce his own songs without buying expensive\nsynthesizers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a huge believer in giving people the ability to express themselves in the\nway that they can, because I think that that provides for a more meritocratic\nworld,\u201d he tells me.\n\nHe saw the possibility of doing something similar with video when he came\nacross research on using deep learning to transfer expressions from one human\nface to another on screen.\n\n\u201cWhat that showcased was the first time a deep-learning network could produce\nvideo frames that looked and felt real,\u201d he says.\n\n## Related Story\n\nThree things we learned about AI from EmTech Digital London\n\nBetter AI avatars and agents are coming.\n\nThat research was conducted by Matthias Niessner, a professor at the Technical\nUniversity of Munich, who cofounded Synthesia with Riparbelli in 2017,\nalongside University College London professor Lourdes Agapito and Steffen\nTjerrild, whom Riparbelli had previously worked with on a cryptocurrency\nproject.\n\nInitially the company built lip-synching and dubbing tools for the\nentertainment industry, but it found that the bar for this technology\u2019s\nquality was very high and there wasn\u2019t much demand for it. Synthesia changed\ndirection in 2020 and launched its first generation of AI avatars for\ncorporate clients. That pivot paid off. In 2023, Synthesia achieved unicorn\nstatus, meaning it was valued at over $1 billion\u2014making it one of the\nrelatively few European AI companies to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat first generation of avatars looked clunky, with looped movements and\nlittle variation. Subsequent iterations started looking more human, but they\nstill struggled to say complicated words, and things were slightly out of\nsync.\n\nThe challenge is that people are used to looking at other people\u2019s faces. \u201cWe\nas humans know what real humans do,\u201d says Jonathan Starck, Synthesia\u2019s CTO.\nSince infancy, \u201cyou\u2019re really tuned in to people and faces. You know what\u2019s\nright, so anything that\u2019s not quite right really jumps out a mile.\u201d\n\nThese earlier AI-generated videos, like deepfakes more broadly, were made\nusing generative adversarial networks, or GANs\u2014an older technique for\ngenerating images and videos that uses two neural networks that play off one\nanother. It was a laborious and complicated process, and the technology was\nunstable.\n\nBut in the generative AI boom of the last year or so, the company has found it\ncan create much better avatars using generative neural networks that produce\nhigher quality more consistently. The more data these models are fed, the\nbetter they learn. Synthesia uses both large language models and diffusion\nmodels to do this; the former help the avatars react to the script, and the\nlatter generate the pixels.\n\nDespite the leap in quality, the company is still not pitching itself to the\nentertainment industry. Synthesia continues to see itself as a platform for\nbusinesses. Its bet is this: As people spend more time watching videos on\nYouTube and TikTok, there will be more demand for video content. Young people\nare already skipping traditional search and defaulting to TikTok for\ninformation presented in video form. Riparbelli argues that Synthesia\u2019s tech\ncould help companies convert their boring corporate comms and reports and\ntraining materials into content people will actually watch and engage with. He\nalso suggests it could be used to make marketing materials.\n\nHe claims Synthesia\u2019s technology is used by 56% of the Fortune 100, with the\nvast majority of those companies using it for internal communication. The\ncompany lists Zoom, Xerox, Microsoft, and Reuters as clients. Services start\nat $22 a month.\n\nThis, the company hopes, will be a cheaper and more efficient alternative to\nvideo from a professional production company\u2014and one that may be nearly\nindistinguishable from it. Riparbelli tells me its newest avatars could easily\nfool a person into thinking they are real.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re 98% there,\u201d he says.\n\nFor better or worse, I am about to see it for myself.\n\n## Related Story\n\nHow Meta and AI companies recruited striking actors to train AI\n\nHollywood actors are on strike over concerns about the use of AI, but for as\nlittle as $300, Meta and a company called Realeyes hired them to make avatars\nappear more human.\n\n### Don\u2019t be garbage\n\nIn AI research, there is a saying: Garbage in, garbage out. If the data that\nwent into training an AI model is trash, that will be reflected in the outputs\nof the model. The more data points the AI model has captured of my facial\nmovements, microexpressions, head tilts, blinks, shrugs, and hand waves, the\nmore realistic the avatar will be.\n\nBack in the studio, I\u2019m trying really hard not to be garbage.\n\nI am standing in front of a green screen, and Oshinyemi guides me through the\ninitial calibration process, where I have to move my head and then eyes in a\ncircular motion. Apparently, this will allow the system to understand my\nnatural colors and facial features. I am then asked to say the sentence \u201cAll\nthe boys ate a fish,\u201d which will capture all the mouth movements needed to\nform vowels and consonants. We also film footage of me \u201cidling\u201d in silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe more data points the AI system has on facial movements, microexpressions,\nhead tilts, blinks, shrugs, and hand waves, the more realistic the avatar will\nbe.\n\nDAVID VINTINER\n\nHe then asks me to read a script for a fictitious YouTuber in different tones,\ndirecting me on the spectrum of emotions I should convey. First I\u2019m supposed\nto read it in a neutral, informative way, then in an encouraging way, an\nannoyed and complain-y way, and finally an excited, convincing way.\n\n\u201cHey, everyone\u2014welcome back to Elevate Her with your host, Jess Mars. It\u2019s\ngreat to have you here. We\u2019re about to take on a topic that\u2019s pretty delicate\nand honestly hits close to home\u2014dealing with criticism in our spiritual\njourney,\u201d I read off the teleprompter, simultaneously trying to visualize\nranting about something to my partner during the complain-y version. \u201cNo\nmatter where you look, it feels like there\u2019s always a critical voice ready to\nchime in, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be garbage, don\u2019t be garbage, don\u2019t be garbage.\n\n\u201cThat was really good. I was watching it and I was like, \u2018Well, this is true.\nShe\u2019s definitely complaining,\u2019\u201d Oshinyemi says, encouragingly. Next time,\nmaybe add some judgment, he suggests.\n\nWe film several takes featuring different variations of the script. In some\nversions I\u2019m allowed to move my hands around. In others, Oshinyemi asks me to\nhold a metal pin between my fingers as I do. This is to test the \u201cedges\u201d of\nthe technology\u2019s capabilities when it comes to communicating with hands,\nOshinyemi says.\n\nHistorically, making AI avatars look natural and matching mouth movements to\nspeech has been a very difficult challenge, says David Barber, a professor of\nmachine learning at University College London who is not involved in\nSynthesia\u2019s work. That is because the problem goes far beyond mouth movements;\nyou have to think about eyebrows, all the muscles in the face, shoulder\nshrugs, and the numerous different small movements that humans use to express\nthemselves.\n\nThe motion capture process uses reference patterns to help align footage\ncaptured from multiple angles around the subject.\n\nDAVID VINTINER\n\nSynthesia has worked with actors to train its models since 2020, and their\ndoubles make up the 225 stock avatars that are available for customers to\nanimate with their own scripts. But to train its latest generation of avatars,\nSynthesia needed more data; it has spent the past year working with around\n1,000 professional actors in London and New York. (Synthesia says it does not\nsell the data it collects, although it does release some of it for academic\nresearch purposes.)\n\nThe actors previously got paid each time their avatar was used, but now the\ncompany pays them an up-front fee to train the AI model. Synthesia uses their\navatars for three years, at which point actors are asked if they want to renew\ntheir contracts. If so, they come into the studio to make a new avatar. If\nnot, the company will delete their data. Synthesia\u2019s enterprise customers can\nalso generate their own custom avatars by sending someone into the studio to\ndo much of what I\u2019m doing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe initial calibration process allows the system to understand the subject's\nnatural colors and facial features.\n\nDAVID VINTINER\n\nSynthesia also collects voice samples. In the studio, I read a passage\nindicating that I explicitly consent to having my voice cloned.\n\nDAVID VINTINER\n\nBetween takes, the makeup artist comes in and does some touch-ups to make sure\nI look the same in every shot. I can feel myself blushing because of the\nlights in the studio, but also because of the acting. After the team has\ncollected all the shots it needs to capture my facial expressions, I go\ndownstairs to read more text aloud for voice samples.\n\nThis process requires me to read a passage indicating that I explicitly\nconsent to having my voice cloned, and that it can be used on Voica\u2019s account\non the Synthesia platform to generate videos and speech.\n\n### Consent is key\n\nThis process is very different from the way many AI avatars, deepfakes, or\nsynthetic media\u2014whatever you want to call them\u2014are created.\n\nMost deepfakes aren\u2019t created in a studio. Studies have shown that the vast\nmajority of deepfakes online are nonconsensual sexual content, usually using\nimages stolen from social media. Generative AI has made the creation of these\ndeepfakes easy and cheap, and there have been several high-profile cases in\nthe US and Europe of children and women being abused in this way. Experts have\nalso raised alarms that the technology can be used to spread political\ndisinformation, a particularly acute threat given the record number of\nelections happening around the world this year.\n\nSynthesia\u2019s policy is to not create avatars of people without their explicit\nconsent. But it hasn\u2019t been immune from abuse. Last year, researchers found\npro-China misinformation that was created using Synthesia\u2019s avatars and\npackaged as news, which the company said violated its terms of service.\n\nSince then, the company has put more rigorous verification and content\nmoderation systems in place. It applies a watermark with information on where\nand how the AI avatar videos were created. Where it once had four in-house\ncontent moderators, people doing this work now make up 10% of its 300-person\nstaff. It also hired an engineer to build better AI-powered content moderation\nsystems. These filters help Synthesia vet every single thing its customers try\nto generate. Anything suspicious or ambiguous, such as content about\ncryptocurrencies or sexual health, gets forwarded to the human content\nmoderators. Synthesia also keeps a record of all the videos its system\ncreates.\n\nAnd while anyone can join the platform, many features aren\u2019t available until\npeople go through an extensive vetting system similar to that used by the\nbanking industry, which includes talking to the sales team, signing legal\ncontracts, and submitting to security auditing, says Voica. Entry-level\ncustomers are limited to producing strictly factual content, and only\nenterprise customers using custom avatars can generate content that contains\nopinions. On top of this, only accredited news organizations are allowed to\ncreate content on current affairs.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t claim to be perfect. If people report things to us, we take quick\naction, [such as] banning or limiting individuals or organizations,\u201d Voica\nsays. But he believes these measures work as a deterrent, which means most bad\nactors will turn to freely available open-source tools instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI put some of these limits to the test when I head to Synthesia\u2019s office for\nthe next step in my avatar generation process. In order to create the videos\nthat will feature my avatar, I have to write a script. Using Voica\u2019s account,\nI decide to use passages from Hamlet, as well as previous articles I have\nwritten. I also use a new feature on the Synthesia platform, which is an AI\nassistant that transforms any web link or document into a ready-made script. I\ntry to get my avatar to read news about the European Union\u2019s new sanctions\nagainst Iran.\n\nVoica immediately texts me: \u201cYou got me in trouble!\u201d\n\nThe system has flagged his account for trying to generate content that is\nrestricted.\n\nAI-powered content filters help Synthesia vet every single thing its customers\ntry to generate. Only accredited news organizations are allowed to create\ncontent on current affairs.\n\nCOURTESY OF SYNTHESIA\n\nOffering services without these restrictions would be \u201ca great growth\nstrategy,\u201d Riparbelli grumbles. But \u201cultimately, we have very strict rules on\nwhat you can create and what you cannot create. We think the right way to roll\nout these technologies in society is to be a little bit over-restrictive at\nthe beginning.\u201d\n\nStill, even if these guardrails operated perfectly, the ultimate result would\nnevertheless be an internet where everything is fake. And my experiment makes\nme wonder how we could possibly prepare ourselves.\n\nOur information landscape already feels very murky. On the one hand, there is\nheightened public awareness that AI-generated content is flourishing and could\nbe a powerful tool for misinformation. But on the other, it is still unclear\nwhether deepfakes are used for misinformation at scale and whether they\u2019re\nbroadly moving the needle to change people\u2019s beliefs and behaviors.\n\n## Related Story\n\nThree ways we can fight deepfake porn\n\nTaylor Swift was recently subject to a vicious nonconsensual deepfake porn\ncampaign. These tools and policies could help us stop it happening again.\n\nIf people become too skeptical about the content they see, they might stop\nbelieving in anything at all, which could enable bad actors to take advantage\nof this trust vacuum and lie about the authenticity of real content.\nResearchers have called this the \u201cliar\u2019s dividend.\u201d They warn that\npoliticians, for example, could claim that genuinely incriminating information\nwas fake or created using AI.\n\nClaire Leibowicz, the head of the AI and media integrity at the nonprofit\nPartnership on AI, says she worries that growing awareness of this gap will\nmake it easier to \u201cplausibly deny and cast doubt on real material or media as\nevidence in many different contexts, not only in the news, [but] also in the\ncourts, in the financial services industry, and in many of our institutions.\u201d\nShe tells me she\u2019s heartened by the resources Synthesia has devoted to content\nmoderation and consent but says that process is never flawless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Riparbelli admits that in the short term, the proliferation of AI-\ngenerated content will probably cause trouble. While people have been trained\nnot to believe everything they read, they still tend to trust images and\nvideos, he adds. He says people now need to test AI products for themselves to\nsee what is possible, and should not trust anything they see online unless\nthey have verified it.\n\nNever mind that AI regulation is still patchy, and the tech sector\u2019s efforts\nto verify content provenance are still in their early stages. Can consumers,\nwith their varying degrees of media literacy, really fight the growing wave of\nharmful AI-generated content through individual action?\n\n### Watch out, PowerPoint\n\nThe day after my final visit, Voica emails me the videos with my avatar. When\nthe first one starts playing, I am taken aback. It\u2019s as painful as seeing\nyourself on camera or hearing a recording of your voice. Then I catch myself.\nAt first I thought the avatar was me.\n\nThe more I watch videos of \u201cmyself,\u201d the more I spiral. Do I really squint\nthat much? Blink that much? And move my jaw like that? Jesus.\n\nIt\u2019s good. It\u2019s really good. But it\u2019s not perfect. \u201cWeirdly good animation,\u201d\nmy partner texts me.\n\n\u201cBut the voice sometimes sounds exactly like you, and at other times like a\ngeneric American and with a weird tone,\u201d he adds. \u201cWeird AF.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. The voice is sometimes me, but in real life I umm and ahh more.\nWhat\u2019s remarkable is that it picked up on an irregularity in the way I talk.\nMy accent is a transatlantic mess, confused by years spent living in the UK,\nwatching American TV, and attending international school. My avatar sometimes\nsays the word \u201crobot\u201d in a British accent and other times in an American\naccent. It\u2019s something that probably nobody else would notice. But the AI did.\n\nMy avatar\u2019s range of emotions is also limited. It delivers Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cTo\nbe or not to be\u201d speech very matter-of-factly. I had guided it to be furious\nwhen reading a story I wrote about Taylor Swift\u2019s nonconsensual nude\ndeepfakes; the avatar is complain-y and judgy, for sure, but not angry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve made myself a test subject for new AI. Not too\nlong ago, I tried generating AI avatar images of myself, only to get a bunch\nof nudes. That experience was a jarring example of just how biased AI systems\ncan be. But this experience\u2014and this particular way of being immortalized\u2014was\ndefinitely on a different level.\n\nCarl \u00d6hman, an assistant professor at Uppsala University who has studied\ndigital remains and is the author of a new book, The Afterlife of Data, calls\navatars like the ones I made \u201cdigital corpses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks exactly like you, but no one\u2019s home,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be the\nequivalent of cloning you, but your clone is dead. And then you\u2019re animating\nthe corpse, so that it moves and talks, with electrical impulses.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s kind of how it feels. The little, nuanced ways I don\u2019t recognize myself\nare enough to put me off. Then again, the avatar could quite possibly fool\nanyone who doesn\u2019t know me very well. It really shines when presenting a story\nI wrote about how the field of robotics could be getting its own ChatGPT\nmoment; the virtual AI assistant summarizes the long read into a decent short\nvideo, which my avatar narrates. It is not Shakespeare, but it\u2019s better than\nmany of the corporate presentations I\u2019ve had to sit through. I think if I were\nusing this to deliver an end-of-year report to my colleagues, maybe that level\nof authenticity would be enough.\n\nAnd that is the sell, according to Riparbelli: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is more like\nPowerPoint than it is like Hollywood.\u201d\n\nOnce a likeness has been generated, Synthesia is able to generate video\npresentations quickly from a script.\n\nSYNTHESIA\n\nThe newest generation of avatars certainly aren\u2019t ready for the silver screen.\nThey\u2019re still stuck in portrait mode, only showing the avatar front-facing and\nfrom the waist up. But in the not-too-distant future, Riparbelli says, the\ncompany hopes to create avatars that can communicate with their hands and have\nconversations with one another. It is also planning for full-body avatars that\ncan walk and move around in a space that a person has generated. (The rig to\nenable this technology already exists; in fact it's where I am in the image at\nthe top of this piece.)\n\nBut do we really want that? It feels like a bleak future where humans are\nconsuming AI-generated content presented to them by AI-generated avatars and\nusing AI to repackage that into more content, which will likely be scraped to\ngenerate more AI. If nothing else, this experiment made clear to me that the\ntechnology sector urgently needs to step up its content moderation practices\nand ensure that content provenance techniques such as watermarking are robust.\n\nEven if Synthesia\u2019s technology and content moderation aren\u2019t yet perfect,\nthey\u2019re significantly better than anything I have seen in the field before,\nand this is after only a year or so of the current boom in generative AI. AI\ndevelopment moves at breakneck speed, and it is both exciting and daunting to\nconsider what AI avatars will look like in just a few years. Maybe in the\nfuture we will have to adopt safewords to indicate that you are in fact\ncommunicating with a real human, not an AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that day is not today.\n\nI found it weirdly comforting that in one of the videos, my avatar rants about\nnonconsensual deepfakes and says, in a sociopathically happy voice, \u201cThe tech\ngiants? Oh! They\u2019re making a killing!\u201d\n\nI would never.\n\n### by Melissa Heikkil\u00e4\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n### Deep Dive\n\n### Artificial intelligence\n\n### Large language models can do jaw-dropping things.
