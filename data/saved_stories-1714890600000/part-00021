It was discovered by Rolf Hagedorn. The\nHagedorn temperature exists because the amount of energy available is high\nenough that matter particle (quark\u2013antiquark) pairs can be spontaneously\npulled from vacuum. Thus, naively considered, a system at Hagedorn temperature\ncan accommodate as much energy as one can put in, because the formed quarks\nprovide new degrees of freedom, and thus the Hagedorn temperature would be an\nimpassable absolute hot. However, if this phase is viewed as quarks instead,\nit becomes apparent that the matter has transformed into quark matter, which\ncan be further heated.\n\nThe Hagedorn temperature, T_H, is about 150 MeV/k_B or about 1.7\u00d710^12 K,^[1]\nlittle above the mass\u2013energy of the lightest hadrons, the pion.^[2] Matter at\nHagedorn temperature or above will spew out fireballs of new particles, which\ncan again produce new fireballs, and the ejected particles can then be\ndetected by particle detectors. This quark matter has been detected in heavy-\nion collisions at SPS and LHC in CERN (France and Switzerland)^[citation\nneeded] and at RHIC in Brookhaven National Laboratory (USA)^[citation needed].\n\nIn string theory, a separate Hagedorn temperature can be defined for strings\nrather than hadrons. This temperature is extremely high (10^30 K) and thus of\nmainly theoretical interest.^[3]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe Hagedorn temperature was discovered by German physicist Rolf Hagedorn in\nthe 1960s while working at CERN. His work on the statistical bootstrap model\nof hadron production showed that because increases in energy in a system will\ncause new particles to be produced, an increase of collision energy will\nincrease the entropy of the system rather than the temperature, and \"the\ntemperature becomes stuck at a limiting value\".^[4]^[5]\n\n## Technical explanation[edit]\n\nHagedorn temperature is the temperature T_H above which the partition sum\ndiverges in a system with exponential growth in the density of states.^[4]^[6]\n\nBecause of the divergence, people may come to the incorrect conclusion that it\nis impossible to have temperatures above the Hagedorn temperature, which would\nmake it the absolute hot temperature, because it would require an infinite\namount of energy. In equations:\n\nThis line of reasoning was well known to be false even to Hagedorn. The\npartition function for creation of hydrogen\u2013antihydrogen pairs diverges even\nmore rapidly, because it gets a finite contribution from energy levels that\naccumulate at the ionization energy. The states that cause the divergence are\nspatially big, since the electrons are very far from the protons. The\ndivergence indicates that at a low temperature hydrogen\u2013antihydrogen will not\nbe produced, rather proton/antiproton and electron/antielectron. The Hagedorn\ntemperature is only a maximum temperature in the physically unrealistic case\nof exponentially many species with energy E and finite size.\n\nThe concept of exponential growth in the number of states was originally\nproposed in the context of condensed matter physics. It was incorporated into\nhigh-energy physics in the early 1970s by Steven Frautschi and Hagedorn. In\nhadronic physics, the Hagedorn temperature is the deconfinement temperature.\n\n## In string theory[edit]\n\nIn string theory, it indicates a phase transition: the transition at which\nvery long strings are copiously produced. It is controlled by the size of the\nstring tension, which is smaller than the Planck scale by some power of the\ncoupling constant. By adjusting the tension to be small compared to the Planck\nscale, the Hagedorn transition can be much less than the Planck temperature.\nTraditional grand unified string models place this in the magnitude of 10^30\nkelvin, two orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck temperature. Such\ntemperatures have not been reached in any experiment and are far beyond the\nreach of current, or even foreseeable technology.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Heat\n  * Thermodynamic temperature\n  * Non-extensive self-consistent thermodynamical theory\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Ga\u017adzicki, Marek; Gorenstein, Mark I.
