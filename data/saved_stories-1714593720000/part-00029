Amazon profit more than triples, topping Wall Street expectations\n\nPublished Tue, Apr 30 202412:01 PM EDTUpdated 5 hours ago\n\nAnnie Palmer@in/annierpalmer/\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Amazon shares rose in extended trading after the company reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings.\n  * Advertising revenue grew 24% in the first quarter, outpacing retail and cloud computing.\n  * Amazon Web Services also reported results that topped estimates.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * AMZN+3.12 (+1.78%)\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks at the Bloomberg Technology Summit in San\nFrancisco on June 8, 2022.\n\nDavid Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAmazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first\nquarter, driven by growth in advertising and cloud computing. The stock ticked\nhigher in extended trading.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did:\n\n  * Earnings per share: 98 cents vs. 83 cents expected by LSEG\n  * Revenue: $143.3 billion vs. $142.5 billion expected by LSEG\n\nWall Street is also looking at these key numbers:\n\n  * Amazon Web Services: $25 billion vs. $24.5 billion in revenue, according to StreetAccount\n  * Advertising: $11.8 billion vs. 11.7 billion in revenue, according to StreetAccount\n\nOperating income soared more than 200% in the period to $15.3 billion, far\noutpacing revenue growth, the latest sign that the company\u2019s cost-cutting\nmeasures and focus on efficiency is bolstering its bottom line. AWS accounted\nfor 62% of total operating profit. Net income also more than tripled to $10.4\nbillion, or 98 cents a share, from $3.17 billion, or 31 cents a share, a year\nago.\n\nSales increased 13% from $127.4 billion a year earlier.\n\nAmazon expects a continued jump in profitability for the second quarter but at\na more measured pace. The company said operating income will be $10 billion to\n$14 billion, up from $7.7 billion a year earlier.\n\nRevenue in the current quarter is expected to be in the $144 billion to $149\nbillion range, Amazon said, representing growth of 7% to 11%. Analysts were\nexpecting growth of 12% to $150.1 billion, according to LSEG.\n\nSales at AWS accelerated 17% in the first quarter to $25 billion, topping Wall\nStreet\u2019s forecast for sales growth of 12% to $24.5 billion. For the past year,\ngrowth in AWS has slowed, as businesses trimmed their cloud spend. But Amazon\nexecutives have said they\u2019re seeing cost optimizations taper off, and they\u2019ve\nindicated that demand for generative artificial intelligence can be a boon for\nits cloud business.\n\nAmazon\u2019s earnings growth has been driven in part by widespread cost-cutting,\ntweaks to its fulfillment operations, and the stabilizing of cloud spending.\nCEO Andy Jassy has become more disciplined in the company\u2019s spending, while\ngrowing profitable services like advertising, cloud computing, Prime\nmemberships and its third-party marketplace.\n\nThe company has laid off more than 27,000 employees since late 2022, with the\ncuts bleeding into 2024. During the first quarter, Amazon let go hundreds of\nstaffers in its health and AWS businesses.\n\nAmazon\u2019s advertising unit saw sales surge 24%, just ahead of consensus\nestimates. It\u2019s the first report since Amazon started running ads in Prime\nVideo, a move analysts predict could generate significant revenue over time.\n\nThe company\u2019s ad business, which grew faster than retail or cloud computing,\nhas become an increasingly important profit driver for Amazon and has emerged\nas a main player in online advertising.\n\nThat market overall started growing again after a brutal 2022, when brands\nreeled in spending to cope with inflation and rising interest rates. Meta,\nSnap and Google parent Alphabet all reported first-quarter results last week\nand showed better-than-expected revenue growth, which was primarily driven by\nimprovements across their ad businesses.\n\nRevenue from third-party seller services, which includes commissions collected\nby Amazon, fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, continued to surge.\nSales in the unit grew 16% year over year to $34.5 billion.\n\nAmazon remains a standout among mega-cap internet companies in that it\u2019s yet\nto implement a quarterly dividend, even as cash and equivalents jumped to\n$73.9 billion in the quarter from $54.3 billion a year earlier. Meta announced\nits first dividend in February at 50 cents a share, and Alphabet followed,\ntelling investors last week that it will start paying a dividend of 20 cents a\nshare. Those companies also announced plans to buy back tens of billions of\ndollars in stock.\n\nThis story is developing.
