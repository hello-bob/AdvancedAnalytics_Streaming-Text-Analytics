From 1940 to 1943, Gregg was in the US Navy. He attended Kansas\nState University from 1945 to 1947 and then transferred to the University of\nSouthern California from which he received his Bachelor of Science in\nElectrical Engineering in 1950. He then continued his postgraduate education\nat the Case Institute of Technology and also back at the University of\nSouthern California. Like many students at the time, Gregg worked throughout\nthe time of his postgraduate studies. In 1956, Gregg began working at Westrex\n(a Western Electric subsidiary). In 1958, he was experimenting with a shellac\ndisc where he\u2019d encoded audio with FM signals in pits and ridges and then read\nthe information with a laser. Gregg\u2019s employers wanted to own the patent for\nthis work, and Gregg refused leading to his termination in 1960. Undeterred,\nGregg went to work for Mincom (a subsidiary of 3M) who was a direct competitor\nof Westrex. He further developed the technology there with Wayne Johnson and\nDean De Moss and he gained the patent for his work in 1962 as an electron beam\nrecording and reproducing system. This work at Mincom covered recording and\nreading discs as well as a method for displaying the decoded data on a\ntelevision. While there are patents for this work filed by 3M, Gregg refused\nto give up full control of his invention. He was fired yet again. David Paul\nGregg was an indefatigable individual, and he chose to start his own company,\nGauss Electrophysics, to further the development of optical video and audio\nstorage. Gregg cited a technical description gracing his desk in 1956 as the\ninspiration for his work, and given that timing, the most likely work was that\nof Antonio Rubbiani from Modena, Italy. He developed a plexiglass disc that\nhad actual images on its surface with light and magnification in the\nturntable. The earliest versions of this had trouble with reproduction due to\ninterference from the electric motor in the turntable, but it was enough to\npublish his results.\n\nThe two Gauss Electrophysics trademarks I could find\n\nAn interesting note is that while Gregg was continuing his work on optical\nstorage and playback, the company\u2019s trademark was filed for the business of\nmagnetic tape recording and duplicating machines, and many of his patents did\nmention using electron beams and lasers for the reading of magnetic tape. As\nfor Gregg\u2019s disc technology, he called it VIDEODISK. It was an analog optical\ndisc with video and two audio tracks. The disc was transparent and light\npassing through the disc was read by a sensor on the side opposite the laser.\n\nIn 1967, Gregg reached out to Philips Electronics to have them either license\nor purchase the technology, but Philips wasn\u2019t interested. MCA, on the other\nhand, most certainly was and they purchased Gauss Electrophysics in 1968 along\nwith all of Gregg\u2019s patents. With this acquisition, MCA created MCA\nLaboratories in Torrance, California. Within just a few years, this became MCA\nDiscoVision, and on the 12th of December in 1972, this research arm of MCA\nheld a press conference at Universal Studios to demonstrate their Disco-Vision\nsystem to the world. As far as I can tell, this was the first public\ndemonstration of a technology of this sort using lasers, reflection, and\nspinning disks. On the MCA discs, video and audio information was encoded as\nvariable distances between the edges of pits in a spiral track, as the laser\npassed over the track during the discs\u2019s rotation these pit variations\nreproduced a frequency-modulated analog signal. These discs were made of thin\nsheets of mylar, and in the demonstration, a single Disco-Vision disc played\nseven minutes of video and audio clipped from twenty two different movies.\nHowever, according to MCA, these discs could hold up to twenty minutes of\nvideo on a single disc with constant angular velocity at eighteen hundred RPM.\nEach track on the disc then contained one video frame, permitting thirty six\nthousand individual frames. An alternative format MCA pursued was the constant\nlinear velocity disc which could hold forty minutes of playback per side, but\nthese discs didn\u2019t allow arbitrary frame access; in other words, the original\nMCA discs could be either twenty minutes for forty minutes, but the forty\nminute discs would not allow a user to randomly access data. These formats\nwere improved over time with CAV eventually offering thirty minutes for NTSC\nand thirty six minutes for PAL on a single side of a disc. CLV was eventually\nimrpoved to allow sixty minutes per side for NTSC and sixty four minutes for\nPAL.\n\nWhile MCA was attempting to make ready its DiscoVision for the mass market,\nPhilips was pursuing an extremely similar technology in the Netherlands.\nRepresentatives from Philips had attended the press conference in December\n1972, and while they\u2019d not wished to work with Gauss previously, they were\napparently impressed by the demonstration, and they contacted MCA Disco-Vision\nimmediately. While the two companies\u2019 technologies were truly close to one\nanother, Disco-Vision did have the distinct advantage of being able to\nreplicate discs, and play from those discs. There is some conflicting\ninformation about Philips\u2019 optical technologies. The most commonly cited\norigin of the work at Philips is with James T. Russell working at the Battelle\nMemorial Institute, completely independently of David Paul Gregg, where his\nwork was viewed by both Philips and Sony. I am sure Russell\u2019s work was\nextremely influential over the years, but I believe that it was the work of\nPiet Kramer who led Philips\u2019 optical research group, Klaas Compaan who caried\nout much of the practical work, and Gijs Bouwhuis working on optics which\nultimately produced Philips\u2019 early optical storage technology. Russell\u2019s work\nbecame far more important later on with a different format. Compaan and Kramer\nbegan working black and white video recorded to a spinning glass disk in 1969,\nand they had a working prototype available in September of 1971. They\ndemonstrated the prototype to Philips\u2019 management in December, and then in\nJuly of 1972, they had a working color prototype.\n\nBy September of 1974, MCA Disco-Vision and Philips began to cooperate on\noptical disc technologies. Certainly, they wished avoid competing with one\nanother with incompatible technologies that would likely make the medium fail\ncompletely, but it also seems to me that they were likely trying to keep RCA\u2019s\nupcoming SelectaVision from becoming successful. I am sure that they were also\nworried about both VHS and BetaMax. While sharing research information and\ntechnologies, the two companies were able to accelerate development. The final\narrangement between the two was that MCA worked on disc mastering and\nreplication while Philips manufactured and distributed the consumer disc\nplayer through its Magnavox brand.\n\nMCA also wanted to tackle the industrial market and they made an agreement\nwith Pioneer to form Universal Pioneer in October of 1977 for this purpose. As\na condition of this joint venture, Pioneer was also able to build a mastering\nand pressing facility in Japan. The most famous of these early systems was the\nPR-7820 models 1, 2, and 3 which was used in video game arcade cabinets, car\ndealerships, and many more places. This model featured 1kb of memory allowing\nit to execute programs stored as data on the analog right channel. While the\nplayer had basic controls on the front panel, a full-featured programming\nremote can be used via IR or wired connectivity as well. The PR-7820 also had\na parallel port, and an optional DB-25 serial port via the UEI-232 interface\nbox.\n\nBy this point, the discs were more recognizable to all of us today. These were\ntwelve inches, reflective aluminum with clear plastic, and the laser that read\nthem was helium-neon at six hundred thirty two nanometer wavelength. The image\nquality was superior to tape and broadcast television, and audio quality was\nsimilarly good. Early discs had analog audio with poor components and\nmastering, but the encoding was far better and less lossy than alternatives\nthen available.\n\nOn the 13th of December in 1978, MCA DiscoVision (yes, no hyphen, they\nrebranded) and Philips Magnavox held a press conference at the Regency Hotel\nin New York. In the ballroom, they told all attending that they\u2019d introduce\ntheir new disc system in Atlanta, Georgia followed by Seattle, Washington. On\nthe 15th of December in 1978, MCA\u2019s discs and Magnavox\u2019s Magnavision VH-8000\nwent on sale in three stores in Atlanta. Magnavox had hoped to make fifty\nplayers available at a price of $749.00 each (about $3588 in 2024), but just\nhalf that number had made it in time. All were sold a few hours after the\nstores had opened, and discs sold well despite many of the purchasers not yet\nowning players. While MCA had hoped to have five hundred titles available at\nlaunch, by February of 1979 as the system entered Seattle stores just fifty\nwere available. The first title marketed and sold was Jaws.\n\nThis was a great debut, but things weren\u2019t actually going well at all.\nComplaints began early. These early discs and players weren\u2019t of high quality,\nsome players weren\u2019t compatible with some discs and/or features, and failure\nrates were high. Despite the trouble, sales continued and the two companies\ncontinued their rollout while Philips began investigating the complaints.\nDiscoVision engineers were also studying the problem, and their solution was\nto modify the player to allow playback of all available discs. Philips derided\nthese mods as band-aids that ameliorated discs not conforming to\nspecifcations. Much to MCA\u2019s credit, the Pioneer PR-7820 was happily playing\nevery available disc while Philips\u2019 players were not.\n\nFor 1978 and 1979, the Magnavox Magnavision VLP/DiscoVision system was alone\non the market, and by the end of 1980, full nationwide rollout was completed.\nThen, in June of 1980, Pioneer chose to introduce the VP-1000 to retail in\nMadison, Minneapolis, Dallas, and Syracuse using the name of LaserDisc. By\nChristmas, Pioneer was everywhere and they\u2019d lowered the price of their player\nto $500 (roughly $1895 in 2024), the number of titles had significantly\nincreased, and Philips was struggling to make sales.\n\nThe Pioneer VP-1000, Pioneer press image\n\nFor MCA, the situation was every bit as grim as that for Philips and even a\nbit more. The company had two existing plants for disc production, mastering,\nand duplication. One, and the first, was a small batch production and research\nfacility in Torrence, California. The second was a large mass duplication\nplant in Carson. This second plant essentially had total responsibility for\nall disc mastering and duplication. Yields were bad, cost of replication was\nhigher than expected, returns were high, and MCA needed money. In the late\n1970s and early 1980s, if you were making a data storage medium and you wanted\nhelp, to whom did you turn? IBM. A bit of information that would surprise\nabsolutely no one, IBM too had been researching optical storage media not too\ndissimilar from MCA\u2019s. On the 19th of September in 1979, MCA DiscoVision\nceased to exist. Under MCA\u2019s new agreement with IBM, a joint venture was\nformed as Discovision Associates. IBM then took charge of all research,\ndevelopment, and manufacturing of discs, and MCA supplied them with their\nknowledge while continuing to do distribution, sales, marketing, and content\nprocurement. In what appears to be a constant with IBM, their staff and that\nof MCA didn\u2019t really get on. IBM had initially expressed intent to improve the\nCarson facility, but they chose instead to build a new location in Costa Mesa.\nFor anyone thinking that this would be the end of it and that MCA\u2019s fortunes\nwould improve, I have rather bad news... that isn\u2019t at all what happened.\nInstead, Pioneer completed the construction of their facility in Kofu and\nbegan mass producing discs of exceedingly higher quality than anything MCA/IBM\ncould produce at the time. By 1981, Discovision Associates was out of money\nand going out of business. Pioneer bought half of the company, bought both\nexisting facilities, and began offering their players for rebadging. Philips\nsubsequently quit producing their own players and just resold Pioneer units.\n\nIn October 1981, LaserDisc expanded to Japan, where the format would see\ngreater success than any other single market. Shortly after this, Pioneer\nbrought the first major change to LaserDiscs, CAA. CAA stands for constant\nangular acceleration and is similar to the constant linear velocity format for\ndiscs. The difference is that CAA varies the angular rotation of the disc in\nsteps. This format became the standard over time as it improved both sound and\npicture quality. This format was updated to CAA55 in 1985. The major change\nwas that play time was reduced to fifty five minutes and five seconds per side\nto allow room for digital audio. This was then updated again in 1987 with\nCAA60 which offered sixty minutes and five seconds per side, and then CAA65\nand CAA70. These later formats had digital audio of 16-bit with a sample rate\nof 44.1 kHz.\n\nI suppose that this was an aspirational statement?\n\nLaserDisc promotional image from Pioneer\n\nWith the advent of high fidelity digital audio and embedded computers on each\nplayer, Pioneer introduced dual format players in European markets capable of\nplaying both NTSC and PAL discs. So, if you had a mate in North America,\nJapan, or South Korea and he sent a copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark to your\nflat near Leeds Met or Le Mirail, you could play the disc assuming you had one\nof these new dual format players. Most Pioneer LaserDisc players from the\nmiddle of the 1980s onward were also capable of CD audio playback, and their\ndisc trays contained small depressions for the smaller disc. This change was\naccompanied by another major change to players, infrared aluminum galluim\narsenide laser diodes replaced the helium-neon lasers.\n\nDespite LaserDisc having both superior video and superior audio when compared\nto VHS, VHS was winning the market. Much speculation can be made about why,\nbut the simplest answer is pricing and convenience. While discs were rather\ncheap ($15 to $40, though box sets and collector\u2019s editions could be\nsignificantly more expensive), and certainly cheaper to produce, the players\nwere quite expensive. For a cost example, the Pioneer LD-660 cost around $800\nin the middle 1980s when a VCR was $600 (that would be $2400 and $1800\nrespectively in 2024). This only got worse over time. As LaserDisc players\nimproved, their costs remained high while VHS player/recorders dropped to\naround $250 by the end of the decade. On the convenience front, the discs were\na foot across, about half a pound, easily damaged, and had to be flipped half\nway through a film. LaserDisc players also didn\u2019t have a recorder function\nwhile VCRs did. The VCR\u2019s recording function also served to lower media costs\nfor those willing to borrow and copy a neighbor\u2019s tape of Back to the Future.\nSo why did LaserDisc persist over time? Cinemaphiles. Just as extremely high\nend audio and video equipment can be purchased today while lower cost and\nlower fidelity options are more common, this was just as true in the 1980s and\n1990s.\n\nOwing to the nature of the market LaserDisc served, LaserDiscs often came with\nspecial features. This was especially true of deluxe home video releases by\nlabels such as the Criterion Collection. These releases were made with the\nbest possible transfers to disc, the most numerous special features, tons of\nartwork and information in the booklet shipped with the disc, and were often\nshipped on multiple discs. Some collector\u2019s editions, boxed sets, and deluxe\nreleases could cost as much as $250 on release like the Star Wars Trilogy\nDefinitive Collection.\n\nImage from Yahoo Auctions Japan\n\nImage from Yahoo Auctions Japan\n\nFor the audience of ARF, a more interesting development was computer control.\nCertainly, most LaserDisc players had embedded computers in them, but the film\nindustry (LucasFilm in particular) used LaserDiscs instead of daily prints to\nfilm with their EditDroid connected to a Sun-1.\n\nEditDroid controls and screens, image from LucasFilm\n\nThere\u2019s also the curious case of the BBC Domesday Project which used a BBC\nMaster and SCSI LaserDisc player that utilized LV-ROM. These discs contained\nsoftware, video, and audio on CAV discs with ADFS allowing for 324M of data\nper disc side.\n\nBBC Domesday system with the National disc, image from\n\nBoth DEC and Apple created systems for the education market. In Apple\u2019s case,\nthis made use of HyperCard and allowed for the creation of LaserStacks on\nMacintosh or the IIgs. This made use of the serial port and required a\nLaserDisc player capable of serial control.\n\nIn 1989, Pioneer purchased nearly all the Philips videodisc patents as well as\nover $100 million worth of patents held by Discovision Associates (but this\nwas not all of Discovision\u2019s patents). By the end of 1990, LaserDisc was in\nroughly a million homes in the USA and Canada, but it was significantly more\npopular in Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Amiga saw some games get released on LaserDisc. For these\ngames the Amiga would need to be paired with a Pioneer unit capable of\ncomputer control such as the PR-7820, LD-V1000, or LD-V2000. Most of these\nwere originally intended for use in arcades that combined an Amiga board (or\nsimilar m68k) with a Pioneer LaserDisc player and offered a light gun or\narcade joystick. Many of these titles were later ported to Sega CD, CD-i, 3DO,\nSega Saturn, or Sony Playstation. Of course, when speaking of the Amiga, a far\nmore common use of LaserDiscs was in combination with a Genlock allowing the\nLaserDisc\u2019s video to be overlaid with other video from the Amiga.\n\nOn the 20th of August in 1993, Pioneer released the LaserActive for $970. The\nLaserActive was a video game console, a CD player, a LaserDisc player, a\nkaraoke machine, and offered an add-on port which could be used to add a Sega\nGenesis or a TurboGrafx-16. The LaserActive also featured an RS-232 port\nallowing for computer control. Given the price of the LaserActive and the\nprice of the add-ons (known as PACs) the system wasn\u2019t successful, though it\nwas the single most expensive way to get a SEGA Genesis. Of course, for those\nfortunate enough to afford one, it did offer crazy versatility. I\u2019d love to\nhave one in my collection, but prices...\n\nPioneer LaserActive with the Genesis PAC\n\nThe 1990s saw the two final developments of the LaserDisc format, AC3 and DTS.\nThe first was AC-3, also known as Dolby Digital, which came to LaserDisc with\nthe release of Clear and Present Danger in 1995 providing 5.1 channel surround\nsound. DTS came to LaserDisc with the rerelease of Jurassic Park in 1997.\n\nDVD launched in 1998, and at first, LaserDisc still offered superior picture\nquality due to kind of bad artefacting on DVDs and due to encoding problems on\nearly DVDs. Yet, DVDs were far smaller and more convenient with nearly all\ntitles requiring a single side of a single disc. The status of the LaserDisc\ndidn\u2019t last either. The final LaserDisc released in the USA was Bringing Out\nthe Dead in 2000. The quality of both DVD players and discs improved quickly,\nthe prices quickly dropped, and by 2001, DVD players were outselling VCRs in\nthe USA. Despite the big disc format\u2019s demise in the States, it continued in\nJapan for some time until Pioneer announced its final batch of three thousand\nplayers on the 14th of January in 2009:\n\n> Pioneer Corporation today announces that it will cease to manufacture its\n> LaserDisc (LD) players upon completing the production of a total of\n> approximately 3,000 more players.\n>\n> In 1980, Pioneer introduced its first consumer LD player (VP-1000) in the\n> U.S. market, followed by the Japanese market in 1981 and other markets\n> accordingly. The company has seen worldwide sales of its LD players reach\n> more than 9.5 million units to date in a market that saw worldwide sales top\n> 16.8 million devices. It has contributed to the audiovisual enjoyment of so\n> many consumers all over the world. However, under the market environment in\n> which new media such as DVD and Blu-ray discs now dominate, it has become\n> difficult for Pioneer to procure the parts required to produce LD players.\n> Consequently Pioneer has been forced to terminate production of its LD\n> products.\n>\n> The final models produced by Pioneer are the DVL-919 (DVD/LD compatible\n> player), CLD-R5 (LD/CD player), DVK-900 (DVD/LD karaoke system), and\n>\n> DVL-K88 (DVD/LD compatible karaoke player).\n>\n> As for repair services, Pioneer will maintain the spare parts required to\n> restore the normal functions of Pioneer LD players during the minimum\n> storage period.\n\nToday, the majority of both LaserDisc players and LaserDiscs can be had\ncheaply, and in some cases they are the only way to watch certain films. In\nmany more cases, the special features (commentary, documentaries about the\nmaking of a film, deleted scenes, and so on) may not be available on any other\nmedium. In fewer cases, the LaserDisc may still be the best version in video,\naudio, or both due to being made from higher quality sources. Unfortunately,\njust as early CDs and DVDs are starting to have some issues, LaserDiscs are\nalso starting to die. On lower quality media, the aluminum layer slowly\noxidizes making the disc unreadable. In other cases, the glue used to bind\nthem is giving way as they weren\u2019t well stored.\n\nDiscovision Associates still exists as a patent licensing company, and they\nstill control some optical patents, which apply to nearly all optical disc\nproducts like CD, DVD, and BluRay.\n\nI now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many\nof you were present for time periods I cover.
