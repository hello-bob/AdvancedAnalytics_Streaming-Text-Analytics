We are a community-\noriented organization run by a small staff of experts and enthusiastic\nvolunteers who work to bring education and cultural understanding about\npsychedelic plant medicines to a wider audience. We promote a bridge between\nthe ceremonial use of sacred plants and psychedelic science and envisage a\nworld where plant medicines and other psychedelics are preserved, protected,\nand valued as part of our cultural identity and integrated into our social,\nlegal, and health care systems.\n\nMake A Tax Deductible Donation Now\n\nHelp us to achieve our mission! From our beginnings in 2017, we have stood\napart from other psychedelic education and advocacy organizations by\npioneering initiatives that support and provide a platform for diverse voices,\nincluding women, queer people, people of color, Indigenous people, and the\nGlobal South. In efforts to address the lack of diverse representation in the\nexpanding psychedelic landscape, we centered our mission around the\nempowerment of marginalized voices to foster cultural and political\nreflections on topics like race, gender, and sexuality in psychedelic science.\nWe believe now more than ever, given the current social and political climate,\nour work is critical to the future of psychedelic healing for humanity.\n\nPlease become a member so that you are able to help Chacruna, yourself, and\nthe world.

The CEC has settled its\nlawsuit with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Homeland\nSecurity (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA).\n\nCEC is the first non-Christian church to receive protection for its spiritual\npractices regarding Ayahuasca. Also, this is the first time in history a\nchurch\u2019s right to import and share its sacrament has been secured without\ngoing to trial. This has positive implications and paves the way for other\nIndigenous-based and syncretic religions. As part of the settlement, within\ntheir rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the CEC will receive\nreligious exemption from the United States Controlled Substances Act (CSA).\nThis settlement affirms legitimacy of Indigenous spiritual traditions within\nthe U.S. legal system by recognizing the CEC as a bona fide religious\norganization.\n\nAs part of the settlement agreement, the CEC has received Schedule 1 Permits\nallowing for importation and preparation of its sacrament, as well as\ndistribution during sacred Ayahuasca ceremony. The agreement affirms the CEC\u2019s\npractices and efforts to protect public/participant safety, and addresses the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns about the diversion of Ayahuasca. This includes\nrequiring health screening and intake procedures, secure storage of Ayahuasca,\ncareful recordkeeping regarding importation, storage, and distribution, and\nnotification of ports of entry.\n\nThe named CEC Plaintiffs, community, Board of Directors, and legal team are\npleased with the outcome. Read the full settlement here.\n\n\u201dAyahuasca ceremony is an essential sacrament for our church. Our ceremony is\nrooted in the Shipibo Amazonian tradition which has been passed down by\ncountless generations. Now, in fulfillment of the ancient Prophecy of the\nEagle and the Condor, this tradition has come to North America. I am honored\nto be an Ayahuasquero with the CEC, and bring to our ceremony the care,\nrespect, and reverence that it deserves. We are grateful for the support of\neveryone that has helped us get this far, including our legal team, our\ncommunity, those that donated to our legal process, those that prayed for us,\nand those that stood by us. Our ancestral practice will continue to support\nthe community and nourish our holistic well-being.\u201d \u2013 Joseph Tafur MD,\nAyahuasquero for CEC\n\n\u201cThis settlement reaffirms our right to practice our spirituality as we have\nalways known. It is a recognition by the U.S. government and an important\nmilestone in honoring and validating indigenous belief systems. Prior to\ncontact, indigenous peoples have used sacred plant medicines for healing and\nceremony since time immemorial. Our relationship with our plant relatives has\nalways been an extension of our worldview. This has been interrupted by the\nimposition of governmental policies that have suppressed our way of life and\ndemonstrated religious intolerance. This settlement is a significant step and\nacknowledgement of our spiritual beliefs as original peoples of the Americas.\nWe are grateful for the support of our donors, legal team, community, and\nGrandmother Ayahuasca. The Church is committed to our mission of spiritual\nunity of all people with the Creator.\u201d \u2013 Belinda P. Eriacho, Board Member\n(Din\u00e9/A:shwii lineages)\n\n\u201cThe CEC was founded on the Prophecy of The Eagle and The Condor as we saw the\nprophecy manifesting in our own lives. This legal decision is another page in\nthe telling of this story.\u201d \u2013 Rodney Garcia MD, Board Member (Pachakuti Mesa\nMedicine Carrier)\n\n\u201cThe CEC\u2019s beliefs, shaped by their vision of a universal spirituality and\nrooted in Indigenous ways, are entitled to respect by the government. The\nresolution of this case represents the government\u2019s recognition of this\ncommunity\u2019s right to exercise their religious beliefs without interference.\nTheir success is a watershed moment in the United States. Indigenous ways are\nreturning to a place of honor, respect, and care in American culture\u2013a culture\nmade more beautiful because of Indigenous ritual, art, and cosmology in which\nall of creation is family. It has been an honor to serve as counsel for the\nCEC and to help support their leaders and members achieve exactly the results\nthey sought, and I am deeply grateful to the CEC for their teachings through\nthis process.\u201d \u2013 Martha Hartney, CEC General Counsel\n\n#### About the Church of the Eagle and Condor\n\nThe CEC is a registered church in the state of Arizona birthed in 2018.
