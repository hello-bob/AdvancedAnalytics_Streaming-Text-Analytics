Medieval Sex Secrets May Hide in\nMysterious Text : ScienceAlert\n\n# Voynich Manuscript Finally Decoded? Medieval Sex Secrets May Hide in\nMysterious Text\n\nHumans17 April 2024\n\nBy Keagan Brewer, The Conversation\n\n(Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library)\n\nThe Voynich manuscript has long puzzled and fascinated historians and the\npublic.\n\nThis late-medieval document is covered in illustrations of stars and planets,\nplants, zodiac symbols, naked women, and blue and green fluids. But the text\nitself \u2013 thought to be the work of five different scribes \u2013 is enciphered and\nyet to be understood.\n\nIn an article published in Social History of Medicine, my coauthor Michelle L.\nLewis and I propose that sex is one of the subjects detailed in the manuscript\n\u2013 and that the largest diagram represents both sex and conception.\n\n## Late-medieval sexology and gynaecology\n\nResearch on the Voynich manuscript has revealed some clues about its origins.\nCarbon dating provides a 95% probability the skins used to make the manuscript\ncome from animals that died between 1404 and 1438.\n\nHowever, its earliest securely known owner was an associate of Holy Roman\nEmperor Rudolf II, who lived from 1552 to 1612, which leaves more than a\ncentury of ownership missing.\n\nCertain illustrations (the zodiac symbols, a crown design and a particular\nshape of castle wall called a swallowtail merlon) indicate the manuscript was\nmade in the southern Germanic or northern Italian cultural areas.\n\nOne section contains illustrations of naked women holding objects adjacent to,\nor oriented towards, their genitalia. These wouldn't belong in a solely herbal\nor astronomical manuscript.\n\nTo make sense of these images, we investigated the culture of late-medieval\ngynaecology and sexology \u2013 which physicians at the time often referred to as\n\"women's secrets\".\n\nManuscript 408, also called the Voynich manuscript, is held at a Yale\nUniversity library. (Yale University Library)\n\nFirst we looked at Bavarian physician Johannes Hartlieb (circa 1410\u201368), who\nlived around the time and place the Voynich manuscript was made.\n\nHartlieb wrote about plants, women, magic, astronomy and baths. He also\nrecommended the use of \"secret letters\" (such as a cipher, secret alphabet, or\nsimilar) to obscure medical recipes and procedures that may result in\ncontraception, abortion or sterility.\n\nAlthough his secret alphabet hasn't survived, analysing his work has helped us\nunderstand the attitudes that would have inspired the use of encipherment at\nthe time.\n\nFor instance, Hartlieb felt a strong apprehension about \"women's secrets\"\nbecoming widely known. He worried his writings could facilitate extramarital\nsex and that God would condemn him if this happened.\n\nIn his un-enciphered writings, he either refuses or hesitates to write about\ncertain topics, such as post-partum vaginal ointments, women's sexual\npleasure, claims of women giving birth to animals, the \"correct\" coital\npositions for conception, libido-altering dietary advice, and information\nabout poisonous, hallucinogenic, contraceptive or abortive plants.\n\nWriting for male aristocrats in vernacular Bavarian (rather than academic\nLatin), Hartlieb says such knowledge should be restricted from sex workers,\ncommoners, children, and in some cases from women themselves \u2013 who were\nbecoming increasingly literate.\n\nAs a man who valued heterosexual marriage and women's \"modesty\", and who\ncondemned lust, promiscuity and prostitution, he was perfectly conventional\nfor his milieu.\n\nWomen illustrated in the manuscript are shown holding unidentified objects\ntowards their genitalia. (Yale University Library)\n\n## Censorship\n\nIf such attitudes were widespread back then, was the censorship of women's\nsecrets also widespread? The short answer is: yes.\n\nDuring our research, we decoded a number of ciphers from this period (but none\nfrom the Voynich manuscript). The longest was a 21-line cipher from late-\nmedieval northern Italy that obscured a recipe with gynaecological uses,\nincluding abortion.\n\nWe also found many examples of authors self-censoring, or of readers erasing\nor destroying information in gynaecological and/or sexological texts. Censors\nwould often only obscure a few words, usually genital terms or plant names in\nrecipes \u2013 but sometimes they would remove entire pages or chapters.\n\nOne Bavarian manuscript includes recipes for invisibility and magic spells for\nsexually coercing women, after which two pages have been removed. The censor\nwrites this removal was done \"not without reason\".\n\n## The Rosettes\n\nBy analysing the Voynich illustrations through this lens, we propose the\nRosettes \u2013 the manuscript's largest and most elaborate illustration \u2013\nrepresents a late-medieval understanding of sex and conception.\n\nOur proposal is in keeping with the patriarchal culture of the time and\nresolves many of the manuscript's apparent contradictions. It also allows us\nto identify several of the illustration's features.\n\nThe Rosettes illustration consists of circles, tubes, dots, bulbs,\npassageways, castles and town walls. (Yale University Library)\n\nIn late-medieval times the uterus was believed to have seven chambers, and the\nvagina two openings (one external and one internal).\n\nWe believe the nine large circles of the Rosettes represent these, with the\ncentral circle representing the outer opening, and the top-left circle\nrepresenting the inner opening. The eight outer circles have smooth edges\nsince they represent internal anatomy, while the central circle has a shaped\nedge since it represents external anatomy.\n\nAbu Bakr Al-R\u0101z\u012b, a Persian physician who influenced late-medieval European\nmedicine, wrote that five small veins exist in the vaginas of virgins. We see\nthese running from the top-left circle towards the centre.\n\nThe five veins running from the top-left to the central circle. (Yale\nUniversity Library)\n\nPhysicians back then also believed a male and female component were necessary\nfor conception, and both of these were called \"sperm\". These are shown in\nyellow (male) and blue (female).\n\nWomen were thought to receive pleasure from the motion of the two sperms in\nthe uterus, which is depicted through the lines and patterns.\n\nIt was also thought the uterus had two horns or spikes, which we can see on\nthe top-right and bottom-right circles.\n\nA closeup of the bottom 'horn'. (Yale University Library)\n\nThe castles and town walls may represent wordplay on the German term schloss,\nwhich had meanings including \"castle\", \"lock\", \"female genitalia\" and \"female\npelvis\".\n\nA closeup of a castle embedded in the illustration. (Yale University Library)\n\nAnd the two suns in the far top-left and bottom-right likely reflect\nAristotle's belief that the Sun provides natural heat to the embryo during its\nearly development.\n\nAristotle thought the Sun provided natural heat to the embryo. (Yale\nUniversity Library)\n\nWhile many features of the illustration are yet to be understood, our proposal\nis worth close scrutiny. We hope future research into the manuscript will\napproach it through a similar lens. Perhaps, with enough clues, we might find\na way to finally decode this elusive text.\n\nKeagan Brewer, Research Fellow, Department of Media, Communications, Creative\nArts, Language, and Literature, Macquarie University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons\nlicense.
