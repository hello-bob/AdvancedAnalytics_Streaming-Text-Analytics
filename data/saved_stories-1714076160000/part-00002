Australia, the Americas, and the Middle East and Africa (MEA) are\nall in their sights.\n\nEurope leads the way\n\n\u201cWe tend to put money where we see a case to work,\u201d says Amir Sharifi, Chief\nInvestment Officer of Hy24.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about geography, it\u2019s a matrix between the geography and a\ncertain vertical within the hydrogen value chain.\n\n\u201cIn practice we\u2019ve started with Europe, it\u2019s the most advanced geography in\nterms of supporting regulations,\u201d he adds.\n\nHy24, a joint venture of the Paris-based private equity company Ardian and\ninvestment fund FiveT Hydrogen, manages the Clean Hydrogen Infrastructure Fund\nwith \u20ac2 bn from more than 50 investors including major industrial companies.\nRelated: Hedge Funds Dump U.S. Energy Stocks to Buy Crude Options\n\nThe fund life is 12 years from its start in 2022 with expectation of asset\nsale. Its investments have gone into countries with strong state support\nprograms, where ample wind and sunshine offer large amounts of low-cost power\nproduction in Europe\u2019s northern and southern peripheries.\n\nIt has invested in Everfuel, the Danish developer whose founder, a former\nSenior Vice President at Nel Hydrogen, is well known in the industry. Everfuel\nis working in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Germany, with a 20MW\nelectrolyser to begin operation this year.\n\nIt has also invested in start-up company H2 Green Steel, which is developing a\nfully integrated plant in Boden, Sweden, now under construction with 700MW\nelectrolysis capacity. The project offers numerous advantages, with low cost\nhydropower, proximity of iron ore mines and ports, available land, and support\nfrom the Swedish government.\n\n\u201cAll of these factors made us comfortable investing in a new steel plant, the\nfirst new plant in Europe in 50 years,\u201d says Sharifi.\n\n\u201cWe already have long-term offtakes, with \u20ac3.5bn debt to finance the\nconstruction, and \u20ac1.5bn equity, of which we have been the lead investor.\u201d\n\nIn Spain, Hy24 has taken an ownership position in Enagas Renovable, in\npartnership with gas transmission operator Enagas, with a large portfolio of\nrenewable fuels projects. They have invested in a joint venture for green\nhydrogen production with offtake by Spanish oil and gas companies including\nRepsol and CEPSA.\n\nSharifi emphasizes the importance of European regulations to make these\ninvestments feasible by creating industrial demand. These include the revised\nRenewable Energy Directive (RED III) with its binding targets for renewable\nfuels of non-biological origin in the transport and industry sectors, and the\nintroduction of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which ensures\nthat steel produced with green hydrogen will compete against imported steel\nproduced by carbon-intensive methods.\n\nLarge but limited\n\nNo\u00e9 van Hulst, who is Special Advisor for Hydrogen to the International Energy\nAgency, points to another key piece of the European hydrogen landscape now\ncoming into place. It is the Hydrogen Backbone, the repurposing of gas\npipelines and development of new pipeline infrastructure to connect the\nNetherlands\u2019 ports and main industrial clusters, now financed and under\nconstruction.\n\nThe project, led by Dutch natural gas company Gasunie, was launched last year\nat Port of Rotterdam, where a dedicated 32-km hydrogen pipeline \u2013 HyTransPort\n\u2013 is being built. The Hydrogen Backbone will eventually link to Germany and to\nBelgium.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe pipeline system under development is a key support for projects now\nplanned and under construction on the Maasvlakte, the man-made westward\nextension of the Port of Rotterdam.\n\nShell\u2019s Hydrogen Holland I project on the Maasvlakte is now under\nconstruction. A 200MW electrolysis plant, powered by electricity generated by\nthe Hollandse Kust (Noord) offshore wind farm, will produce hydrogen for the\nShell Energy and Chemicals Park through the HyTransPort pipeline. Thyssenkrupp\nUhde will fabricate the alkaline water electrolysis plant.\n\nThe German state-owned energy company Uniper is pursuing its H2Maasvlakte\nproject, with 100MW of electrolysis capacity to produce green hydrogen by\n2026, and planned expansion to 500MW by 2030. US company Plug Power Inc. will\nprovide PEM electrolyzer technology.\n\nMeanwhile in France, Air Liquide\u2019s Normand\u2019Hy project has received public\nfunding for development of a 200 MW electrolysis plant to supply renewable and\nlow-carbon hydrogen to a TotalEnergies refinery and other industrial users in\nthe Normandy industrial basin, starting from the second half of 2026 according\nto news reports.\n\nWhile these large projects are impressive, van Hulst thinks the base of active\nprojects in Europe is far too low.\n\n\u201cEurope is advancing more slowly than expected,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s still too\nmuch uncertainty about the support schemes, too much uncertainty about\nnational implementation of the European directives that have finally been\nconcluded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really need to accelerate to get closer to the EU targets.\u201d\n\nLooking afield\n\nDespite his concerns, van Hulst does see hydrogen imports to Europe as\ninevitable before 2030. He refers to Germany\u2019s H2Global auctioning system now\nunderway for offtake agreements for green ammonia, methanol and e-fuels. The\nresults of the first round of auctioning, with \u20ac900m in subsidies, are\nexpected soon. The outcome will inform subsequent rounds of auctioning with\nthe addition of \u20ac3.5bn to the program announced by the German government\nearlier this year.\n\n\"The import volumes before 2030 will be relatively small, then hopefully ramp\nup by 2030 and after with higher volumes,\u201d says van Hulst.\n\nAn additional window will open with participation of The Netherlands in a\n\u20ac600m auction, the first Dutch/German joint auction through the H2Global\nmechanism that will take place before end of year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see who is really willing to sign contracts, which companies\nand export countries,\u201d he says.\n\nApart from the auctioning mechanisms, he expects the Netherlands, Germany, and\nBelgium to develop bilateral export-import corridors and projects with\nindividual countries.\n\nLoad factor\n\nHy24 is looking beyond Europe, with approximately 50% of the fund devoted to\nprojects in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and the other half to\nbe split equally among the Americas and Asia-Pacific region.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt has invested in Intercontinental Energy, with projects in Oman and\nAustralia currently in pre-FID study phase. They are located in coastal desert\nregions with combined wind and solar production yielding a very competitive\nload factor of close to 70%.\n\n\u201cThe load factor is very important,\u201d says Amir Sharifi. \u201cThere are not many\nlocations in the world with the combination of a lot of available space and a\nhigh load factor.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be able to produce hydrogen at most competitive cost, it requires access\nto power that will be both very cheap on capex, which requires large scale,\nbecause balance of plant is usually a big element,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you have more volumes of assets then you have less balance of plant as a\npercentage, so you have big economies of scale.\u201d\n\nThe fund also has a team in the US seeking investment opportunities in\nanticipation of new regulations and tax incentives for green hydrogen under\nthe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nLeading regs\n\nHy24 has entered a strategic framework agreement with the Abu Dhabi-based\nclean energy company Masdar to pursue co-investment in large scale green\nhydrogen production projects worldwide.\n\nAs they look to where production can occur at most competitive cost, they must\nremain quite flexible because of the changing regulatory environment in\ndifferent regions.\n\n\u201cLooking back 18 months ago, we thought the IRA in the US would be a trigger,\u201d\nsays Florian Merz, who is Masdar\u2019s Associate Director of Business Development\nfor Europe.\n\n\u201cNow the US is working on its regs, apparently trying to get them close to\nEuropean standards, and projects are delayed waiting for this.\n\n\u201cAlso, Japan-Northeast Asia is now deciding on regulation and relevant support\nschemes.\n\n\u201cSo, after initial delay, Europe is in the lead in terms of regulatory\nclarity,\u201d he says.\n\nBy Alan Mammoser for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\n  * Should We Keep Investing in Oil and Gas?
