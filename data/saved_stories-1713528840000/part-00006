Now it\u2019s trying to flip the script by\nbeating Toyota to the holy grail of battery technology.\n\nbyJames Gilboy| PUBLISHED Apr 16, 2024 4:25 PM EDT\n\nNews\n\nNissan\n\nShare\n\n32\n\nJames GilboyView james gilboy's Articles\n\n_JamesGilboy\n\njamesgilboy\n\nNissan was once an EV pioneer; now it's playing catch-up. But instead of\ntrying to merely match its competitors, it wants to leapfrog them by being one\nof the first to bring about highly energy-dense solid-state batteries. More\nradical still, it thinks it can do so sooner than one of the battery\ntechnology's biggest proponents: Toyota.\n\nNissan declared its intent Monday in a showing of its in-progress battery\nfactory in Yokohama. The site will be where Nissan pilots a production line\nfor solid-state batteries, which it expects will become commercially available\nby financial year 2028. Nissan expects to produce its first prototype\nbatteries in March 2025, according to Reuters, which reports the automaker\nintends to produce 100 megawatt-hours of solid-state batteries monthly as of\nApril 2028.\n\nNissan Hyper Force EV concept. Nissan\n\nThis timeline is both shorter and more ambitious than that of Toyota, which is\none of the leaders of solid-state battery tech in cars. Toyota has already had\na test vehicle rolling around for years, though its commercialization plans\nare typical Toyota\u2014conservative. While Nissan aims to begin pilot production\nwithin a year, Toyota will wait at least three years until financial year\n2027. Toyota has also been cagey about its total anticipated production\ncapacity, stating only that it'll make enough batteries for 10,000 EVs or so\nin 2030.\n\nNissan meanwhile projects having 1.2 gigawatt-hours of annual production\ncapacity in four years. How many EVs that can supply varies depending on the\ntype of vehicle, as it'd be enough for 20,000 EVs with a battery the size of\nthe Leaf Plus's or 12,000 with a larger battery like the Tesla Model S's.\nEither would put Nissan ahead of Toyota, provided it can actually pull off the\nupset.\n\nSolid-state batteries have so far resisted commercialization due to\ndifficulties in making them functional and reliable in real-world conditions.\nSupposed technological breakthroughs repeatedly make headlines, but practical,\naffordable solid-state packs remain elusive. Being the first to achieve them\nwould put Nissan in an advantageous position, not to mention Honda, which is\ninterested in an EV partnership with Nissan. Its last link-up with General\nMotors didn't pan out, so more than one of Japan's top three automakers'\nfutures may yet be tied to Nissan's big promises. Now let's see if it can make\ngood on them.\n\nGot a tip or question for the author?
