Although the sophisticated steam-\nassisted sailing vessel had been originally constructed as a combat ship, her\ninstruments of war had been recently removed to make room for laboratories,\ndredging equipment, and measuring apparatuses. She and her crew of 243 sailors\nand scientists set out on a long, meandering circumnavigation of the globe\nwith orders to catalog the ocean\u2019s depth, temperature, salinity, currents, and\nbiology at hundreds of sites\u2014an oceanographic effort far more ambitious than\nany undertaken before it.\n\nFor three and a half long, dreary years the crew spent day after day dredging,\nmeasuring, and probing the oceans. Although the data they collected was\nscientifically indispensable, men were driven to madness by the tedium, and\nsome sixty souls ultimately opted to jump ship rather than take yet another\ndepth measurement or temperature reading. One day in 1875, however, as the\ncrew were \u201csounding\u201d an area near the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific,\nthe sea swallowed an astonishing 4,575 fathoms (about five miles) of measuring\nline before the sounding weight reached the floor of the ocean. The bedraggled\nresearchers had discovered an undersea valley which would come to be known as\nthe Challenger Deep. Reaching 6.78 miles at its lowest point, it is now known\nto be the deepest location on the whole of the Earth. The region is of such\nimmense depth that if Mount Everest were to be set on the sea floor at that\nlocation, the mighty mountain\u2019s peak would still be under more than a mile of\nwater.\n\nNothing was known of what organisms and formations might lurk at such depths.\nMany scientists of the day were convinced that such crevasses must be lifeless\nplaces considering the immense pressure, relative cold, total lack of\nsunlight, and presumed absence of oxygen. It would be almost a century before\na handful of inventors and explorers finally resolved to go down there and\ntake a look for themselves.\n\nThe view at Challenger Deep (artist's rendering)\n\nIn the years that followed the Challenger expedition, subsequent surveys of\nthe region ascertained that the Challenger Deep is part of a much larger\nformation, the massive Mariana Trench. This 1,580 mile-long trench is the\nresult of the Pacific tectonic plate subducting beneath the Mariana Plate, and\nthe water pressure at its floor is so difficult to comprehend that it is oft\ndescribed with incomprehensible analogies as \u201cthe weight of fifty jumbo jets,\u201d\n\u201cthe weight of 1,600 elephants on every centimeter of your body,\u201d or \u201call life\nas you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body\nexploding at the speed of light.\u201d\n\nThe first scientist with the know-how and wherewithal to seriously consider a\ndive to the bottom of the Mariana was Auguste Piccard, a Swiss professor,\nphysicist, and inventor of some repute. In the early 1930s, he had gained\nconsiderable scientific fame by constructing and piloting the world\u2019s first\nmanned stratospheric balloon, using a pressurized sphere and helium gasbag of\nhis own design to reach altitudes than no human had previously attained. From\nover 70,000 feet, he conducted experiments to measure cosmic rays, and made\nmeasurements to help prove the theories of his friend Albert Einstein.\nPiccard\u2019s wife\u2014mortified that a middle-aged man would repeatedly subject\nhimself to such risks\u2014insisted that he retire his ballooning career. Much to\nher surprise, he agreed.\n\nIt turned out that he had grander plans afoot. Piccard had realized that a\nvariation of his stratospheric balloon concept could be used as a deep-sea\ndiving apparatus, and he soon set to work constructing his first bathyscaphe\nvehicle. The contraption consisted of a high-pressure passenger sphere\nsuspended beneath a different kind of gasbag\u2014a steel float chamber filled with\ngasoline. Gasoline is much lighter than water, causing it to be buoyant; yet\nit does not compress as air would, which allowed the tank to resist crushing\neven at extreme depths. The bathyscaphe operated a bit like an underwater\nzeppelin: operators descended by using pumps to replace small portions of\ngasoline with seawater, thereby reducing buoyancy. To ascend, operators used\ncontrols to let loose some of the onboard iron pellets used as ballast,\nthereby increasing buoyancy. Small electric propellers provided horizontal\nnavigation.\n\nAuguste Piccard looking through a cone of Lucite (Plexiglass)\n\nPiccard finished his prototype in 1948, and conducted a number of unmanned\ntest dives as far as 10,000 feet. In 1950 he sold the vehicle to the French\nNavy in order to begin construction on an improved design, the bathyscaphe\nTrieste. The new vehicle\u2019s thirteen-metric-ton pressure sphere could\naccommodate two passengers\u2014albeit quite cramped\u2014and included oxygen tanks,\nrebreathers, and carbon dioxide scrubbers. Its hull was five inches thick, and\nit had a single, five-centimeter-wide window made from a thick cone of\nlucite\u2014the only transparent material capable of withstanding the depths this\nvehicle was intended to reach. After the craft had undertaken a number of\nsuccessful test dives, the US Navy purchased the Trieste and shipped it to the\nMarianas to use it in Project Nekton\u2014a series of dives into the ocean\u2019s\ndeepest, darkest recesses to gather information regarding sunlight\npenetration, underwater visibility, transmission of man-made sounds, and\nmarine geological studies of the trench.\n\nOn 23 January 1960, two men clambered aboard the Trieste for its attempt to\ndive into the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench: marine specialist\nLieutenant Don Walsh of the US Navy; and oceanographer Jacques Piccard, son of\nthe vehicle\u2019s inventor. At 76 years of age, Auguste himself was unable to take\npart personally. The two hydronauts were expected to be confined in their\nbattery-powered pressure sphere for over eight hours, including almost four\nhours each for the seven-mile descent and re-ascent. Since no manned or\nunmanned vessel had ever braved the journey to the Challenger Deep, no one was\nsure how much life, if any, would be found there. Most scientists were\nreasonably sure that microorganisms would be found, but some thought it\nunlikely that vertebrates could withstand such an inhospitable environment.\n\nThe Trieste out of water\n\nThe men engaged the pumps to fill the ballast tanks with water, and the\nTrieste slipped beneath the waves to begin its long descent. It only took\nabout sixteen minutes for the explorers to enter the aphotic zone\u2014the depth at\nwhich no light from the surface is present\u2014and the world outside the tiny\nwindow was left in utter darkness aside from the occasional faint flicker of\nphosphorescent organisms. From time to time the Trieste would slow and stop as\nshe encountered a deeper, colder thermal layer, and more gasoline had to be\npumped from the float chamber in order to continue the descent. The two men\nperiodically reported their progress via a sonar-based phone handset, however\nthere was little to report aside from the rapidly rising readings on the\npressure gauges and the falling readings on the thermometers. The warmth\ninside the uninsulated sphere steadily dwindled.\n\nPartway into their long descent, Walsh and Piccard grew alarmed when they\ndiscovered they were no longer able to raise the mother ship on the\nsonar/hydrophone communication system, even after repeated attempts. The two\nmen were thus left truly isolated from the outside world. Curled up in the\ncramped, cold, and dimly-lit sphere, the adventurers continued their hours-\nlong downward journey with only one another\u2019s voices and the occasional pop or\ngroan from the Trieste\u2019s strained hull to punctuate the anxious silence.\n\nAt approximately four hours into their descent\u2014several thousand feet above the\nsea floor\u2014a sharp clang sounded through the pressure sphere and the vehicle\nshuddered violently. Once their wincing subsided, the men did what they could\nto inspect the craft and its condition. It seemed that the water pressure at\nthis never-before-encountered depth\u2014six tons per square inch\u2014had cracked the\nouter pane of the lucite window. For the moment the vehicle itself remained\nwatertight, but the damage was worrisome. The Trieste was outfitted with a few\nsafety systems; for instance, the ballast doors were held closed by\nelectromagnets, so in the event of electrical failure the doors would fall\nopen and drop the ballast, causing the vehicle to rise to the surface. But\nsuch systems would be of no help to the men inside if the 1,000 atmospheres of\npressure crushed their delicate passenger compartment. Moreover, no other\nvehicle in existence was capable of reaching such depths, which meant that if\nher float tank became compromised there was no chance of rescue. Nevertheless,\nthe stalwart scientists opted to press on.\n\nLt. Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard inside the Trieste pressure sphere\n\nAbout three quarters of an hour later, the bathyscaphe Trieste made history as\nits hull came to a gentle rest on the silty floor of the Challenger Deep\nabyss. The Trieste and her crew had spent four hours and forty-eight minutes\nin transit. The bathyscaphe instrumentation indicated a depth of 37,798 feet\nand external pressure of 1,099 atmospheres\u2014approximately eight tons per square\ninch. The scientists flicked on the exterior lights to cast light on a patch\nof earth that had not been illuminated in millions of years, and peered out\nthrough the peephole. Through the swirling clouds of agitated silt and\nsediment the pair could make out a flatfish which had been disturbed by the\nvehicle\u2019s unexpected touchdown. They also spotted some shrimp and jellyfish\nswimming nearby. These observations proved that the water even at such depths\nwas not stagnant and stationary\u2014there was sufficient ocean current to bring in\noxygen for complex life. The mission was not equipped with cameras, however,\nso the historic exploratory moment was sadly left unphotographed.\n\nWalsh and Piccard attempted to use the sonar/hydrophone handset again, and\nfound that it had inexplicably regained function. They reported their arrival\nand observations to the mother ship, and although their voices took\napproximately seven seconds to cross the seven miles of water, they came\nthrough quiet yet clear. The hydronauts observed the \u201cdiatomaceous ooze\u201d\nthrough their tiny, cracked window, shivering in the 45F degree cold and\nmunching chocolate bars to regain lost calories. For the most part, the few\norganisms they observed were little different from those found in the miles of\nwater above them. Thirty or so minutes later, concerned that the damaged\nlucite porthole would not withstand the pressure indefinitely, the men dumped\ntwo tons of iron ballast and the vehicle slowly began to rise. Three and a\nquarter uneventful hours later, the bathyscaphe Trieste bobbed to the Pacific\nsurface, having entered the history books with a record that could never be\nbested. Walsh and Piccard had been to the abyss and back.\n\nLater the same day, the US Department of Navy issued a press release boasting\nthat \u201cthe United States now possesses the capability for manned exploration of\nthe sea down to the deepest part of its floor.\u201d Project Nekton was a success.\nJacques Piccard and Lt. Don Walsh were flown to Washington DC to receive\ndecorations from President Eisenhower, and to retell the story of their\ndescent of alternating boredom and terror.\n\nCloseup of the Trieste pressure sphere and ballast-dropping system\n\nGrand plans were hatched to do further research with the intrepid bathyscaphe,\nincluding bringing back samples of water, soil, and organisms from the abyssal\ntrench. The US Navy, however, was less enthusiastic. The millions of dollars\nthey had invested in the mission had not borne any particularly compelling\nscientific fruit aside from proving that such a dive was possible. Perhaps\nmost importantly, they had demonstrated America\u2019s deep-sea dominance to the\npesky Soviets. Moreover, the public\u2019s fickle attention was fixed rather firmly\non the developing Space Race, leaving little interest in oceanic exploration.\n\nFor a few years the Trieste continued her career as a diving vehicle, though\nnever again to such depths as the Challenger Deep. Most of her later missions\nwere pedestrian by comparison, although when the nuclear submarine USS\nThresher was lost at sea in 1963 she did participate substantially in the\nsearch efforts. Soon thereafter she was retired, and many of her systems were\nincorporated into other dive vehicles. Much of her outer hull was left intact,\nhowever, and it is currently on exhibit at the Navy Museum in Washington, DC.\nIn the 45 years since the Trieste was taken out of service, there has not been\nanother manned dive vehicle capable of reaching the floor of the Mariana.\n\nEven today, less than 5% of the Earth\u2019s oceans have been explored by humans\naccording to the US National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration. Of course\nhumanity has not entirely abandoned the exploration of the deep. In 1995 a\nrobotic probe did finally revisit the faraway floor of the Mariana trench, as\ndid another such probe in 2009. Though we must not diminish the achievements\nof those plucky remote-controlled explorers, it seems a shame that no humans\nhave ever attempted to return. There are some people who say that there is\nlittle value in sending humans to harsh places where hardier robotic proxies\ncan go in their stead; but for the indefatigable adventurer, that sort of\nstick-in-the-mud, stay-at-home complacency is unfathomable.\n\nUpdate 25 March 2012: Famed Hollywood director James Cameron has since become\nthe third human to visit Earth\u2019s deepest chasm. He\u2019s like the Pete Conrad of\nthe Mariana.\n\nUpdate 13 May 2019: A third expedition has reached the floor of the Mariana.\nVictor Vescovo found human garbage in the ocean\u2019s deepest trench.\n\n\u00a9 2009 All Rights Reserved.

With a comma, the sentence becomes a comma splice, which some persons\ncall a run-on sentence.\n\nHowever, I have seen more and more instances of the punctuation that you used,\nand I am well aware that rules of grammar, punctuation, and spelling are\nalways years behind the speakers and writers of the language. (For example,\nmost people no longer write \u201cto-morrow.\u201d) What\u2019s your opinion, based on what\nyou have seen in various publications?

Many of them were hired back out of retirement, and many others\nwere given quick training, to fix lots and lots (and lots) of old code before\nthe deadline.

If it went unchecked\nthen chaos certainly could have ensued, but it was never going to happen. The\nmedia jumped on it and sold the fear (as they do) leading everyone to think it\nwas a real threat (ie. that the problems couldn\u2019t be fixed) when in reality it\nwas huge, pain in the backside, glitch... that would be fixed by a lot of\ntedious work. Much the same as the Mayan doomsday calendar (for want of a\nbetter term)... sounds to me like the calendar ends in 2012 (like they were\ngoing to map it out forever, had to stop some time) and the conclusion has\nbeen drawn that they have predicted the end of the world. I must admit,\ncompared to most readers here I am totally green on the specifics of the Mayan\ncalendar topic, but I am commenting more on the propensity for the media (and\npeople in general) to gravitate toward the sensational side of situations in\nthe face of logic and common sense.\n\nbubaks\n\nPosted 26 July 2009 at 09:38 am\n\nIt would be interesting to read an article here on DI regarding the Y2K bug\nelucidating the measures that were taken to avoid the fiasco.\n\nKeith Henson\n\nPosted 26 July 2009 at 05:03 pm\n\nOk everyone, never posted before but I feel an imperative which must be\nanswered.
