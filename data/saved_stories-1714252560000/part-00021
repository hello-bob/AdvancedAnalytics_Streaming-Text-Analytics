What Happens Instead May Be\nFar Better. And Far Worse.\n\ncassidysteeledale.substack.com\n\n7\n\nShare\n\nCassidy Steele Dale forecasts and contextualizes the present to equip us to\nmake a better, kinder future...\n\n... and one of those ways to give you Part One of why we\u2019re not going to have\nanother Civil War.\n\nUp front: Americans are not special. We could have another Civil War. We\u2019ve\ndone it before \u2013 and we\u2019ve done worse. We\u2019ve fought one of the largest,\ndeadliest, mass-slaughter civil wars in the history of mankind, we\u2019re\nincredibly armed and we use those guns on ourselves and our fellow citizens\nevery single day, and if you\u2019ve forgotten, we\u2019re still the only nation on\nEarth that has ever detonated nuclear weapons in anger. We can \u2013 and do \u2013 go\nbad sometimes.\n\nHowever.\n\nPreviously I laid out four potential futures for American democracy between\nnow and 2040. Significant civil violence is possible in two of the four\nscenarios. The violence is perpetrated mostly by one side in one of the four\nscenarios and is perpetrated reciprocally in another.\n\n  * These four potential futures are not what most political prognosticators have been forecasting, and look further out.\n\n  * None of the scenarios \u2013 not even the two in which limited violence is likely \u2013 result in a Second American Civil War.\n\nWe are not going to have another Civil War.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n####\n\nThere is no modern circumstance in which American states will go to war with\nother American states.\n\nArmed conflict between American states is not in the cards.\n\n  * States aren\u2019t little independent mini-countries like they were in the mid-1800s.\n\n  * States\u2019 economies are interconnected now in ways they weren\u2019t in the runup to the Civil War and states don\u2019t have their own militaries. Further, no American state\u2019s economic strength is dependent upon the labor of slaves and no other American state has that as an animating objection. American states know now that inter-state warfare would amount to economic suicide immediately.\n\n  * The risk some prognosticators worried about ten or twenty years ago \u2013 that the U.S. might break up into new countries made up of economic blocs \u2013 is probably off the table as the U.S. has begun re-shoring and friend-shoring some of its industries and capacities again, which is more apt to stitch American states\u2019 economies even closer together. (Side note: those previously-forecasted economic blocs like, say, the Pacific Northwest carving itself off, California seceding, etc. were a fear rooted in globalization making parts of the U.S. face away to abandon from the main body of the United States, not face inward to conflict with other U.S. states.) Nowadays, for all the secessionist daydreaming in Texas and California nobody there is seriously considering or attempting it and not even Texans truly want to secede from the Union because Buc-ee\u2019s Beaver Nuggets gotta be shipped in from somewhere.\n\n  * Many Americans have lived in more than one state. Americans still find their identity \u2013 and invest their loyalty \u2013 in their national identity rather than their state identity. Everyone in this country thinks of themselves as an American patriot first and an Ohio patriot never at all.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no future in which Red and Blue geographic areas go to war with\neach other.\n\n  * Yes, most cities and (increasingly) most suburbs are Blue and rural areas are Red. And yes, the rural Red areas are emptying out as people migrate into Blue areas... where even Red people trend Blue over time.\n\n  * Cities don\u2019t have militias, rural militias can\u2019t take cities, and police don\u2019t know (or care about) land maneuver warfare.\n\n  * Separately-but-related: If you live in a Red state and think that Red states have meaningful leverage against Blue states economically or by, like, withholding American agriculture from Blue states or cities, forget it. Agribusiness won\u2019t sacrifice itself for Red states or Red areas. And somewhere around 88% of U.S. GDP comes from about 350 cities and municipalities (the bulk of which are Blue) and only 12% from rural areas (which are often Red). So if you think the Red states are half of the country or half of the economy and have the power to blackmail or starve out Blue areas into doing their will, you better get right with Jesus and math and do it fast.\n\nThere is no room in any building anywhere in this country where Florida and\nGeorgia are plotting to attack Virginia. There is no new Confederate States of\nAmerica being secretly organized or assembled somewhere. The South is not\nrising again. It\u2019s the wrong paradigm for our current political situation and\nnone of that crap is in the cards now.\n\n####\n\nThe National Guard forces in American states \u2014 despite that they are commanded\nby each state\u2019s governor \u2014 will not function as any state\u2019s military force on\na battlefield against other Americans.\n\nThe National Guard isn\u2019t designed for that, built for that, armed for that, or\nwilling to do it. At best it\u2019s built for short-term peacekeeping, helping\nenforce curfews, disaster relief, and a few other things; they can\u2019t incur\ninto other states. And if Governor Livid were to order his National Guard to\ninvade a neighboring state, that National Guard commander say OOPS I dropped\nthe motor pool\u2019s car keys down the grate on my way into the Governor\u2019s\nMansion, sir, I\u2019ll need the city to get down there and retrieve them. I\u2019m\nwilling to sign the forms. Whatever they are. In triplicate. On Monday. No,\nNEXT Monday.\n\n####\n\nNo, the United States military will not get involved. They will stay on base.\n\nThis was a major concern of U.S. military senior officers especially toward\nthe end of Trump\u2019s term \u2014 that Trump would order the military to help him\nconduct a self-coup to keep him in office and/or to order the military to\nattack unarmed American protesters as if they were an advancing hostile\nforeign force. The debate among many senior U.S. military officers appeared to\nbe not whether to fulfill any such order but over how to balk.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions \u2014 and how he duped many federal and local police officers and\nthe D.C. National Guard into attacking unarmed protesters in Lafayette Square\non June 1, 2020 \u2014 made many U.S. military officers blanch. Every U.S. military\nofficer is trained to the point where the following is in the blood they\nbleed: U.S. forces are not to defend, not attack Americans, and that U.S.\nforces are commanded by civilian officials \u2014 they are the arm of the will of\nthe American people. For any segment of the U.S. military to attack Americans\nwould first require a total, deep, and complete overriding of everything those\nU.S. military officers believe.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to what significant numbers of former U.S.\nmilitary officers and officials have been saying and interpolate that to\ncurrent officers (who as currently-serving professionals do not comment on\nsuch matters), you\u2019ve already noticed that mannnnnny military officers loathe\nTrump. I mean a lot of them wouldn\u2019t tactically piss on him if he were\nstrategically on fire.\n\nIf some crackpot officer tries to take his guys out to invade Vermont or\nattack the White House or the Capitol, the Secretary of the Army (or the\nrelevant senior officer) is (a) probably going to notice ahead of time and (b)\napt to Soup-Nazi him and his guys with a NO PENSION FOR YOU and COURT MARTIAL\nFOR YOU IF YOUR WHEELS HIT PAVEMENT and THE ONLY HOSPITAL NEARBY WITH A\nBULLET-TRAUMA CENTER TO TREAT YOU IS IN THAT BLUE CITY YOU\u2019RE ABOUT TO INVADE\nAND THEY DON\u2019T LIKE YOU. And if that doesn\u2019t cut off that force at the knees,\nother officers and their units will stop them.\n\n####\n\nLots of people are saying (in polls) they\u2019re afraid we\u2019re going to have\nanother civil war but no one is actually seriously arguing, organizing, or\nplanning for one. And there are no \u201carmies\u201d to fight one.\n\nSure, there are some scary polls that say that a lot of Americans think\nanother civil war is going to happen in the next decade and/or that violence\nmay be needed to fix the country somehow but hardly anyone \u2013 except a few\nClark Bars on YouTube and online \u2013 are actually trying to organize and plan\nfor a civil war.\n\nI am not worried about mass warfare between large groups of Americans in a\nbattlefield situation.\n\nFirst, other than Trump there\u2019s no living major American political figure who\ncould even halfway inspire any significant amount of violence. Think about it:\n\n  * Marjorie Taylor Greene couldn\u2019t successfully lead an insurrection out of a parking lot.\n\n  * Matt Gaetz? If he attempts to lead anything the next headline will read MAN WITH MOST PUNCHABLE FACE IN WASHINGTON GETS PUNCHED IN THE FACE IN WASHINGTON BY REPUBLICAN. The Second Civil War would end with him out cold in the Cloak Room.\n\n  * Bernie Sanders? He wants social justice, better mittens, a decent rural hospital system, and soup.\n\n  * President Biden couldn\u2019t inspire mass violence because he does not want to.\n\nSecond, not even Trump could probably do it nowadays. The \u201carmy\u201d he deployed\nagainst the Capitol on January 6 was made up of only the crowd in attendance\nthat day \u2014 and no one beyond that responded to his calls anywhere else in the\ncountry. At all. Trump\u2019s crowds now outside the courthouse for his election\ninterference trial in New York number about two dozen people who could\nprobably be defeated by an elite Waffle House night shift crew.\n\nNot even George Washington could do it these days. Think about it:\n\n  * If a Republican George Washington rose from the dead and tried to muster an army to fight Democrats TODAY, the Republicans who would deign to respond would be so disorganized and confused they\u2019d rally in the nearest Wendy\u2019s parking lot and not be able to organize their own lunch order much less a battle plan or any Baconator-centric logistics lines. (Side note: I would consider fighting if Baconators were a consistent part of the logs line.) Remember that the last time a large-ish number of armed conservatives attempted to take over anything for more than an afternoon they couldn\u2019t successfully hold (or supply themselves at) a national park.\n\n  * If a Democratic George Washington rose from the dead and tried to muster an army to fight Republicans TODAY, the Democrats who would deign to respond would more like say \u201cFight who? You mean like actually shoot-fight with guns? Why? Hey, man, you OK? You don\u2019t look so good. Come sit down over here. We have electricity in this Wendy\u2019s. And air conditioning. We invented mayonnaise while you were gone. Those guys over there with the guns love mayo. Oh, and we got rid of slavery. Baconator?\n\nIn order to have a big ol\u2019 civil war you have to have two big, mass-armed\nsides. There aren\u2019t two big, mass-armed sides and aren\u2019t going to be. And\nwhen\u2019s the last time you heard of an armed liberal militia?\n\n####\n\nBut what about Antifa? No. Just... no.\n\nAntifa doesn\u2019t actually exist \u2013 not really. It\u2019s a point of view. And it\u2019s a\n\u201cgroup\u201d that only sorta occasionally exists for a few hours at a time. It\u2019s a\nreaction \u2018force\u2019 that shows up to respond when Nazis show up in American\nstreets and it goes home when the Nazis leave. That\u2019s it.\n\n  * Antifa is short for \u201cantifascist.\u201d \u201cAntifa\u201d are just people who believe this country is where Germany was in about 1930 when Nazis won the public square by literally beating up Germans of conscience until the Germans of conscience were cowed. Antifa here sees themselves as the people who will go out into the street and thwart Neo-Nazis from taking control of the public square and of public discourse.\n\n  * This means no actual Nazis in the streets = no antifa. Don\u2019t want any antifa running around? Then don\u2019t put Nazis into the streets.\n\n  * Why haven\u2019t you seen antifa in the streets since the Trump era? No Nazis in the streets now.\n\nWhat are antifa doing when they\u2019re not in the streets shouting at, doxxing,\nand/or punching Nazis?\n\nNOTHING. There is no Secret-Antifa-Ninja-Force. There are no Secret-Antifa-\nNinja-Force al-Qaeda training camps somewhere in San Francisco where they are\nall gay-marrying each other and strategizing how to snowflake-murder-you with\navocado toast.\n\n  * Also: Secret-Antifa-Ninja-Force-That-Doesn\u2019t-Actually-Exist is NEVER coming out to your town in the country to maraud BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING OUT THERE THAT THEY WANT.\n\nYes, I\u2019m oversimplifying this... but not by much. But right now, real \u201cantifa\u201d\nis home eating Doritos.\n\nMoreso, most \u201cantifa\u201d don\u2019t even think they\u2019re antifa. Listen, right now\nsomewhere out there is some dumbass who once halfway-punched a Nazi during a\nTiki-Torch-White-Power March a few years ago who\u2019s back in the apartment and\nhe\u2019s just seen some NRA propaganda implying that Secret-Antifa-Ninja-Force is\ncoming for Hellfire, Montana and Hellfire-ians should buy as many guns as\npossible RIGHT NOW to fend off that oncoming Masked Antifa Force and he\u2019s\nwandering back into the hallway with his Doritos and saying \u201cMike! Mike! This\nthing online says we have bombs and shit and a plan or something. Do we have\nbombs and shit? Is there a group text? Are we not on it? You\u2019d tell me if\nthere was a group text with a plan, right? Do I need to wash my black hoodie?\nNot that one, the Walmart one. The one I wear to work. I have a shift at Sweet\nFrog on Thursday. I can\u2019t go do ninja shit on Thursday because Craig will get\npissed. I\u2019m going down to the laundry room. I\u2019m taking the Doritos.\u201d\n\n  * Spoiler alert to you and Doritos Boy: There is no group text. There is no antifa master plan. There are no bombs and shit. But Doritos are on sale right now at Safeway. Right there on the endcap. So Vaya con Dios.\n\n####\n\nOK, about Black Lives Matter because somebody is going to ask.\n\nNo, Black Lives Matter is not going to overthrow America or cause societal\ncollapse. When police kill an unarmed black man, the black (and the rest of\nthe human) community has said, \u201cPolice, please do not kill us\ndisproportionately to the rates you kill non-black people.\u201d When the police\nreply with \u201cWe don\u2019t see a problem here. We will kill you at the rates we\nwant. And you\u2019re just going to have to like it,\u201d the community tends to lodge\nits objections more vociferously. So police, if you don\u2019t do dumb things and\nthen dismiss, ignore, or double down on it you will not have protests. Also,\nwhen the community feels that they have not been abandoned by politicians\n(like Trump when he was in office) they do not conclude that they have been\nleft completely alone to defend their lives and rights by themselves. Anyway,\nthat\u2019s it. That\u2019s all of it. That\u2019s the whole thing.\n\n  * Looters are the ones who predatorily-piggyback off of them; they are not them.\n\n  * Anti-murder protesters have not yet learned that if/when they wind up \u2018controlling territory\u2019 because the police have backed up a few blocks that the protesters themselves must secure their \u2018territory\u2019 from looters who will swoop in from behind. Because predatory media figures will cynically claim that the looters are you and you are the looters and thereby discredit your Please-don\u2019t-murder-us-at-undue-rates message. Ironically, it will help if the public sees anti-murder protesters thwarting looters by night and protesting peacefully by day.\n\nSo to recap so far: I am not worried about a Second Civil War of the sort of\nthe First. No states against states, no militaries against militaries on\nbattlefields, and no Alliance of Mayonnaise Militias against an Antifa-Dorito-\nHorde. There\u2019s no alliances, no organizations, and no armies. While there\u2019s\nfear of another Civil War but no one is seriously arguing for one, organizing\nfor one, planning for one, or fighting one. Anywhere.\n\nI\u2019m arguing absence. What\u2019s necessary for another big-battle, mass-death,\ntotal-disaster Civil War is not present. If we as a country had decided we\nwill have another Civil War soon we would be actually building anything toward\none and we\u2019re not.\n\nI hear you, though: But that can\u2019t be right! None of this can be right! What\nabout all the militia groups? What about all the discussion and screaming\nonline and on social media?? Surely we must be about to come to blows!!\n\nMaybe people will but armies won\u2019t. And I\u2019m less worried about that than you\nmight think.\n\nBut that\u2019s the subject for next week.\n\n40 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n40\n\nShare this post\n\n#### We Are Not Going to Have Another Civil War.
