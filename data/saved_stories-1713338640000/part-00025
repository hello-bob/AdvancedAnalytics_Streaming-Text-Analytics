The decision allows the mission to progress to completion of final\ndesign, followed by the construction and testing of the entire spacecraft and\nscience instruments.\n\nArtist\u2019s concept of Dragonfly soaring over the dunes of Saturn\u2019s moon Titan.\n\nNASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Steve Gribben\n\n\u201cDragonfly is a spectacular science mission with broad community interest, and\nwe are excited to take the next steps on this mission,\" said Nicky Fox,\nassociate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in\nWashington. \"Exploring Titan will push the boundaries of what we can do with\nrotorcraft outside of Earth.\u201d\n\nIn early 2023, the mission successfully passed all the success criteria of its\nPreliminary Design Review. At that time, however, the mission was asked to\ndevelop an updated budget and schedule to fit into the current funding\nenvironment. This updated plan was presented and conditionally approved in\nNovember 2023, pending the outcome of the fiscal year 2025 budget process. In\nthe meantime, the mission was authorized to proceed with work on final mission\ndesign and fabrication to ensure that the mission stayed on schedule.\n\nWith the release of the president\u2019s fiscal year 2025 budget request, Dragonfly\nis confirmed with a total lifecycle cost of $3.35 billion and a launch date of\nJuly 2028. This reflects a cost increase of about two times the proposed cost\nand a delay of more than two years from when the mission was originally\nselected in 2019. Following that selection, NASA had to direct the project to\nreplan multiple times due to funding constraints in fiscal years 2020 through\n2022. The project incurred additional costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nsupply chain increases, and the results of an in-depth design iteration. To\ncompensate for the delayed arrival at Titan, NASA also provided additional\nfunding for a heavy-lift launch vehicle to shorten the mission\u2019s cruise phase.\n\nThe rotorcraft, targeted to arrive at Titan in 2034, will fly to dozens of\npromising locations on the moon, looking for prebiotic chemical processes\ncommon on both Titan and the early Earth before life developed. Dragonfly\nmarks the first time NASA will fly a vehicle for science on another planetary\nbody. The rotorcraft has eight rotors and flies like a large drone.\n\nDragonfly is being designed and built under the direction of the Johns Hopkins\nApplied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, which manages the\nmission for NASA. Elizabeth Turtle of APL is the principal investigator. The\nteam includes key partners at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,\nMaryland; Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado; NASA\u2019s Ames Research\nCenter in Silicon Valley, California; NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in\nHampton, Virginia; Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania; Malin\nSpace Science Systems in San Diego, California; Honeybee Robotics in Pasadena,\nCalifornia; NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California; CNES\n(Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales) in Paris; the German Aerospace Center\n(DLR) in Cologne, Germany; and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) in\nTokyo. Dragonfly is the fourth mission in NASA\u2019s New Frontiers Program,\nmanaged by NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for the\nagency\u2019s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.\n\n## Share\n\n## Details\n\nLast Updated\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nEditor\n\nWILLIAM KEETER\n\n## Related Terms\n\n  * Dragonfly\n  * Planetary Science\n  * Planetary Science Division\n  * Saturn\n  * Science & Research\n  * Science Mission Directorate\n  * The Solar System\n\nReturn to top\n\n### The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of\nhumanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\n  * About NASA's Mission\n\nJoin Us\n\n  * Home\n  * News & Events\n  * Multimedia\n  * NASA+\n  * Missions\n  * Humans in Space\n  * Earth & Climate\n  * The Solar System\n  * The Universe\n  * Science\n  * Aeronautics\n  * Technology\n  * Learning Resources\n  * About NASA\n  * NASA en Espa\u00f1ol\n\n### Follow NASA\n\n  * More NASA Social Accounts\n  * NASA Newsletters\n\n  * Sitemap\n  * For Media\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * FOIA\n  * No FEAR Act\n  * Office of the IG\n  * Budget & Annual Reports\n  * Agency Financial Reports\n  * Contact NASA\n  * Accessibility\n\n  * Page Last Updated:\n\n4 hours ago\n\n  * Page Editor:\n\nSMD Content Editors\n\n  * Responsible NASA Official for Science:\n\nDana Bolles\n\n", "frontpage": false}
