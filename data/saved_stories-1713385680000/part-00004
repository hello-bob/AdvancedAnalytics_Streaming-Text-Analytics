In keeping with our\ncommitment to open generative AI, we aim to make the model weights available\nfor self-hosting with a Stability AI Membership soon.\n\nTo learn more about deployment options please contact us here. To get started\nwith the Stable Diffusion 3 API, visit the documentation page.\n\nWe\u2019re also inviting a limited number of users to participate in the early\nrelease of our Stable Assistant Beta, featuring Stable Diffusion 3. In its\nlimited release, Stable Assistant enables content creation with Stability AI\u2019s\ncutting-edge image and language models.\n\n### Performance\n\nWe have partnered with Fireworks AI, the fastest and most reliable API\nplatform in the market, to deliver Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion 3\nTurbo.\n\nWith Fireworks AI, we will also deliver an enterprise-grade API solution that\nensures 99.9% service availability\u2014essential for enterprises relying on our\ndeveloper platform for their most important generative AI workloads. Our\ncustomers can confidently utilize our services for their mission-critical\noperations.\n\n### Safety\n\nWe believe in safe, responsible AI practices. This means we have taken and\ncontinue to take reasonable steps to prevent the misuse of Stable Diffusion 3\nby bad actors. Safety starts when we begin training our model and continues\nthroughout the testing, evaluation, and deployment. By continually\ncollaborating with researchers, experts, and our community, we expect to\ninnovate further with integrity as we continue to improve the model.\n\nWith Stable Diffusion 3, we strive to offer adaptable solutions that enable\nindividuals, developers, and enterprises to unleash their creativity, aligning\nwith our mission to activate humanity\u2019s potential.\n\nGet started with Stable Diffusion 3 on the Stability AI Developer Platform API\nhere. To learn more about enterprise deployment options, including self-\nhosting, please contact us here.\n\nTo stay updated on our progress follow us on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and\njoin our Discord Community.\n\nBryce Wilson\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## MindEye2: Shared-Subject Models Enable fMRI-To-Image With 1 Hour of Data\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Careers HPC Center Brand Resources\n\nMembership\n\nStability AI Membership Professional Membership Agreement\n\nLegal\n\nAcceptable Use Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Use Discord Terms of Service AI\nAct Suggested Amendments\n\nContact Us\n\npress@stability.ai partners@stability.ai\n\nSubmit a Support Request\n\nSocials\n\n\u00a9 STABILITY AI LTD, 2024\n\nBy using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
