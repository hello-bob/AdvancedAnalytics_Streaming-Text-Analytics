She is also the host of\nHell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and\nAudible Originals.\n\nApr 24, 2024, 12:00 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nKenneth Lobo M\u00e9ndez, director of planning and sustainability in electricity\nmanagement, and Marco Jim\u00e9nez Chavez, an engineer, at the state-run\nelectricity utility Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE).\n\nCollage by Israel Vargas | Photos by Justine Calma\n\nKenneth Lobo M\u00e9ndez, director of planning and sustainability in electricity\nmanagement, and Marco Jim\u00e9nez Chavez, an engineer, at the state-run\nelectricity utility Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE).\n\nCollage by Israel Vargas | Photos by Justine Calma\n\nWhile most of the world still runs on dirty fossil fuels, Costa Rica has\ngenerated nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources of energy for\nnearly a decade. For comparison, the US generates just over 20 percent of its\nelectricity from renewable sources.\n\nCosta Rica made global headlines in 2015 for generating 100 percent of its\nelectricity from renewable energy for 75 days in a row. Today, it consistently\ngets around 99 percent of its electricity from renewables. Even so, it\u2019s not a\nperfect system. Climate change poses new risks to the power grid, and Costa\nRica has a lot of work left to do to get more solar and wind farms online.\n\nThe Verge spoke with Kenneth Lobo M\u00e9ndez, director of planning and\nsustainability in electricity management, and Marco Jim\u00e9nez Chavez, an\nengineer who works on generation expansion planning at the state-run\nelectricity utility Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE). We wanted\nto know what\u2019s led to the country\u2019s success with renewable energy and what\nproblems it has to troubleshoot now in a warming world.\n\nWe wanted to know what\u2019s led to the country\u2019s success with renewable energy\nand what problems it has to troubleshoot now in a warming world\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity, and most of the\nconversation was interpreted from Spanish to English.\n\nCosta Rica generates around 99 percent of its electricity from renewable\nsources. How was the country able to accomplish that?\n\nKenneth Lobo M\u00e9ndez: The secret of this achievement is mainly planning.\n\nIdentify the capacity of the different energy sources so you can get the big\npicture about how different resources can work together to get a renewable\nsystem. In the winter, like a six-month period from June to December, many of\nthe hydropower plants get surplus flows. That\u2019s when we have low wind, but we\nhave more hydropower. And then in the summer, like from December to May\nperhaps, we get low hydropower, so the other sources of energy complement that\nelectricity supply \u2014 mainly wind power, biomass, and geothermal.\n\nWhy does Costa Rica rely so heavily on hydropower, which makes up 73 percent\nof electricity generation?\n\nKLB: There are two main reasons why hydropower is so important in the country.\nThe first one is because there\u2019s plenty of hydropower resources. Costa Rica\nlies in a tropical zone with heavy rainfall. And also we have good topography\n[and] elevation difference for producing power.\n\n### Related\n\n  * Want to restore a forest? Give it back to Indigenous peoples who call it home\n\nThe other one is that the founders of this utility had the vision. There was a\nlaw in 1949 [which established ICE] that states that the country should\ndevelop its natural resources for electricity supply. Hydropower was the only\nsource or the only technology that was available at the time.\n\nWith any energy project, even with clean energy, there can still be damage.\nThere has been opposition to large hydroelectric dams because they harm river\necosystems and displace people from their homes. How do you think about those\nrisks?\n\nKLB: Planning needs social and environmental aspects, it\u2019s very important.\nFrom the start of the project, we get the communities and all the stakeholders\ninvolved in the project. We know that perhaps this will be a little more\nexpensive. However, with this perspective the project will be held with lower\nrisk and we can fulfill our environmental and social requirements.\n\nKenneth Lobo M\u00e9ndez, director of planning and sustainability in electricity\nmanagement at the state-run electricity utility Instituto Costarricense de\nElectricidad (ICE). The Verge spoke with Lobo M\u00e9ndez at the Cach\u00ed dam in Costa\nRica.\n\nHow is climate change affecting electricity generation?\n\nKLB: That\u2019s a big challenge, how to manage the hydropower resource in the\nfuture.\n\nOur own studies have shown that in the short term, we won\u2019t see a significant\nimpact. In the mid term, like in 2030, in the north of the country, there will\nbe a decrease in rainfall. Most of the country\u2019s hydropower capacity is in the\nnorth. So, it will be affected.\n\nIn the long term, what we see is an increase in hydropower production \u2014 but in\nthe west and south of the country, mainly because rains will get heavier, more\nintense in that region.\n\nMarco Jim\u00e9nez Chavez: There\u2019s a hydroelectric plant called Arenal. It\u2019s one of\nthe most important plants in the country, and it\u2019s in the zone where we expect\nlower precipitation due to climate change. In the south of the country, we\nwill get heavier rainfall. However, we can\u2019t get that rainfall into our\nsystem; our plants are not ready to harness that amount of water.\n\nSo how will you prepare for that?\n\nMJC: Diversify.\n\nThe thing with a renewable energy system is that you also need to diversify so\nthat you won\u2019t be subjected to only the availability of water. You can avoid\nthat risk and share the risk with the other energy sources. Hydropower will\nstill be a great percentage of the country\u2019s energy mix, but new energy\nsources will be added to the system, for example: solar power and wind.\nAnother important source is geothermal because it\u2019s the only renewable energy\nsource that does not depend on climate variability.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a problem because hydropower does not have the same variability as\nsolar wind. So, if we get more solar and more wind, our system will have more\nvariability. So, we need to get back up to that variability. And that\u2019s where\nbatteries are also important.\n\nMarco Jim\u00e9nez Chavez, an engineer who works on generation expansion planning\nat the state-run electricity utility Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad\n(ICE). The Verge spoke with Jim\u00e9nez Chavez at the Cach\u00ed dam in Costa Rica.\n\nWhat effects did El Ni\u00f1o and drought have in 2023?\n\nKLB: There are two effects that El Nino has on the country. The first one is\non the demand side because the climate is hotter, so everybody is using the\nair conditioners and the electricity demand gets higher.\n\nThe other effect is a significant reduction in hydropower not only in Arenal\nbut also in other power plants across the country. We got a 16 percent\nreduction in inflow to our hydropower reservoirs.\n\nIn the rainy season, our reservoirs normally recover. However, they\u2019ve been\nextremely low in 2023. So, our main concern is that the hot season in 2024\nwill be a little bit complicated.\n\nDoes drought lead to burning more fossil fuels?\n\nKLB: We need to have insurance for the period when we don\u2019t have green power,\nwe don\u2019t have hydropower. So, we get a small percentage of electricity from\ndiesel thermal power plants, but only as a backup.\n\nSwitch to renewable energy. Stop deforestation. Restore ecosystems. They\u2019re\nlofty goals that more and more corporations and governments are setting for\nthemselves. If it seems too ambitious, just look to Costa Rica. It\u2019s the first\ntropical country to have reversed deforestation, and it generates nearly 100\npercent of its electricity from renewable sources of energy.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to learn from those successes and even more to gain from\nchallenges the country now has to tackle. Seasons are increasingly\nunpredictable. Could climate change upend past victories? Meanwhile,\nIndigenous leaders face violence from people trying to stop their campaigns to\nreclaim and reforest Indigenous territories. Can the country undo a history of\nland-grabbing?\n\nThe Verge explored those questions on the ground in Costa Rica, with support\nfrom the International Center for Journalists and local media organization\nPunto y Aparte, and found hard-learned lessons that cross borders.\n\nIt\u2019s suspected that diesel thermal power plant use will increase in 2024\nbecause of low hydropower. Another resource that we can tap is electricity\nfrom the regional electricity market with Central American countries. However,\nbecause we are in the same region, they also have the same problems. They\u2019ve\nalso got low hydropower; there\u2019s not a lot of resources in the region to\nshare.\n\nIn the US, we\u2019re used to many smaller private electric utilities. Does having\na national energy company like ICE make it easier to adopt renewable energy?\n\nKLB: In our perspective, yes, it\u2019s an advantage that the planning is held by a\ngovernment state company. It can make a plan for the country according to the\ngovernment\u2019s vision. We only sell what we need, and there\u2019s no interference\nfrom different stakeholders. It makes the planning process more simple.\n\nPhotography by Justine Calma / The Verge\n\nThe International Center for Journalists supported this reporting, and Punto y\nAparte contributed to the report.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Biden signs TikTok \u2018ban\u2019 bill into law, starting the clock for ByteDance to divest it\n\n  2. ## What happens after your country runs on 99 percent renewable electricity?\n\n  3. ## A morning with the Rabbit R1: a fun, funky, unfinished AI gadget\n\n  4. ## Steam will stop issuing refunds if you play two hours of a game before launch day\n\n  5. ## Framework won\u2019t be just a laptop company anymore\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Science\n\n  * ### How 14 tribes plan to use the Biden administration\u2019s solar grants\n\n  * ### Asia is officially the most \u2018disaster-prone\u2019 region in the world\n\n  * ### Anker\u2019s minimalistic home backup batteries are ready for blackout season\n\n  * ### Europe\u2019s warming up at nearly twice the global average, says new report\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
