It was launched from Johnston Atoll on July 9, 1962,\nand was the largest nuclear test conducted in outer space, and one of five\nconducted by the US in space.\n\nA Thor rocket carrying a W49 thermonuclear warhead (designed at Los Alamos\nScientific Laboratory) and a Mk. 2 reentry vehicle was launched from Johnston\nAtoll in the Pacific Ocean, about 900 miles (1,450 km) west-southwest of\nHawaii. The explosion took place at an altitude of 250 miles (400 km), above a\npoint 19 miles (31 km) southwest of Johnston Atoll. It had a yield of 1.4 Mt\n(5.9 PJ). The explosion was about 10\u00b0 above the horizon as seen from Hawaii,\nat 11 pm Hawaii time.^[1]^: 3\n\n## Operation Fishbowl[edit]\n\nMain article: Operation Fishbowl\n\nThe Starfish test was one of five high-altitude tests grouped together as\nOperation Fishbowl within the larger Operation Dominic, a series of tests in\n1962 begun in response to the Soviet announcement on August 30, 1961, that\nthey would end a three-year moratorium on testing.^[2]\n\nIn 1958, the United States had completed six high-altitude nuclear tests that\nproduced many unexpected results and raised many new questions. According to\nthe U.S. Government Project Officer's Interim Report on the Starfish Prime\nproject:^[3]\n\n> Previous high-altitude nuclear tests: YUCCA, TEAK, and ORANGE, plus the\n> three ARGUS shots were poorly instrumented and hastily executed. Despite\n> thorough studies of the meager data, present models of these bursts are\n> sketchy and tentative. These models are too uncertain to permit\n> extrapolation to other altitudes and yields with any confidence. Thus there\n> is a strong need, not only for better instrumentation, but for further tests\n> covering a range of altitudes and yields.\n\nThe Starfish test was originally planned as the second in the Fishbowl series,\nbut the first launch (Bluegill) was lost by the radar tracking equipment and\nhad to be destroyed in flight.^[4]^: 247\n\nThe initial Starfish launch attempt on June 20 was also aborted in flight,\nthis time due to failure of the Thor launch vehicle. The Thor missile flew a\nnormal trajectory for 59 seconds; then the rocket engine stopped, and the\nmissile began to break apart. The range safety officer ordered the destruction\nof the missile and warhead. The missile was between 30,000 and 35,000 feet\n(9,100 and 10,700 m) in altitude when it was destroyed. Parts of the missile\nand some radioactive contamination fell upon Johnston Atoll, nearby Sand\nIsland, and the surrounding ocean.^[4]\n\n## Explosion[edit]\n\nAnother view of Starfish Prime through thin cloud, as seen from Honolulu\n\nOn July 9, 1962, at 09:00:09 Coordinated Universal Time (11:00:09 pm on July\n8, 1962, Honolulu time), the Starfish Prime test was detonated at an altitude\nof 250 miles (400 km). The coordinates of the detonation were\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n16\u00b028\u2032N 169\u00b038\u2032W / 16.467\u00b0N 169.633\u00b0W / 16.467; -169.633.^[1]^: 4 The actual\nweapon yield came very close to the design yield, which various sources have\nset at different values in the range of 1.4 to 1.45 Mt (5.9 to 6.1 PJ). The\nnuclear warhead detonated 13 minutes 41 seconds after liftoff of the Thor\nmissile from Johnston Atoll.^[5]\n\nFrame of the Starfish Prime Nuclear Test\n\nStarfish Prime caused an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that was far larger than\nexpected, so much larger that it drove much of the instrumentation off scale,\ncausing great difficulty in getting accurate measurements. The Starfish Prime\nelectromagnetic pulse also made those effects known to the public by causing\nelectrical damage in Hawaii, about 900 miles (1,450 km) away from the\ndetonation point, knocking out about 300 streetlights,^[1]^: 5 setting off\nnumerous burglar alarms, and damaging a telephone company microwave link.^[6]\nThe EMP damage to the microwave link shut down telephone calls from Kauai to\nthe other Hawaiian islands.^[7]\n\nA total of 27 small rockets were launched from Johnston Atoll to obtain\nexperimental data from the Starfish Prime detonation. In addition, a large\nnumber of rocket-borne instruments were launched from Barking Sands, Kauai, in\nthe Hawaiian Islands.^[8]\n\nA large number of United States military ships and aircraft were operating in\nsupport of Starfish Prime in the Johnston Atoll area and across the nearby\nNorth Pacific region.\n\nA few military ships and aircraft were also positioned in the region of the\nSouth Pacific Ocean near the Samoan Islands. This location was at the southern\nend of the magnetic field line of the Earth's magnetic field from the position\nof the nuclear detonation, an area known as the \"southern conjugate region\"\nfor the test. An uninvited scientific expeditionary ship from the Soviet Union\nwas stationed near Johnston Atoll for the test, and another Soviet scientific\nexpeditionary ship was in the southern conjugate region near the Samoan\nIslands.^[9]\n\nAfter the Starfish Prime detonation, bright auroras were observed in the\ndetonation area, as well as in the southern conjugate region on the other side\nof the equator from the detonation. According to one of the first technical\nreports:^[8]\n\n> The visible phenomena due to the burst were widespread and quite intense; a\n> very large area of the Pacific was illuminated by the auroral phenomena,\n> from far south of the south magnetic conjugate area (Tongatapu) through the\n> burst area to far north of the north conjugate area (French Frigate\n> Shoals)... At twilight after the burst, resonant scattering of light from\n> lithium and other debris was observed at Johnston and French Frigate Shoals\n> for many days confirming the long time presence of debris in the atmosphere.\n> An interesting side effect was that the Royal New Zealand Air Force was\n> aided in anti-submarine maneuvers by the light from the bomb.\n\nThese auroral effects were partially anticipated by Nicholas Christofilos, a\nscientist who had earlier worked on the Operation Argus high-altitude nuclear\nshots.\n\nAccording to U.S. atomic veteran Cecil R. Coale,^[10] some hotels in Hawaii\noffered \"rainbow bomb\" parties on their roofs for Starfish Prime,\ncontradicting some reports that the artificial aurora was unexpected.\n\n\"A 'Quick Look' at the Technical Results of Starfish Prime\" (August 1962)\nstates:^[8]\n\n> At Kwajalein, 1,400 [nautical] miles [2,600 km; 1,600 mi] to the west, a\n> dense overcast extended the length of the eastern horizon to a height of 5\n> or 8 degrees. At 0900 GMT a brilliant white flash burned through the clouds\n> rapidly changing to an expanding green ball of irradiance extending into the\n> clear sky above the overcast. From its surface extruded great white fingers,\n> resembling cirro-stratus clouds, which rose to 40 degrees above the horizon\n> in sweeping arcs turning downward toward the poles and disappearing in\n> seconds to be replaced by spectacular concentric cirrus like rings moving\n> out from the blast at tremendous initial velocity, finally stopping when the\n> outermost ring was 50 degrees overhead. They did not disappear but persisted\n> in a state of frozen stillness. All this occurred, I would judge, within 45\n> seconds. As the purplish light turned to magenta and began to fade at the\n> point of burst, a bright red glow began to develop on the horizon at a\n> direction 50 degrees north of east and simultaneously 50 degrees south of\n> east expanding inward and upward until the whole eastern sky was a dull\n> burning red semicircle 100 degrees north to south and halfway to the zenith\n> obliterating some of the lesser stars. This condition, interspersed with\n> tremendous white rainbows, persisted no less than ninety minutes.\n>\n> At zero time at Johnston, a white flash occurred, but as soon as one could\n> remove his goggles, no intense light was present. A second after shot time a\n> mottled red disc was observed directly overhead and covered the sky down to\n> about 45 degrees from the zenith. Generally, the red mottled region was more\n> intense on the eastern portions. Along the magnetic north-south line through\n> the burst, a white-yellow streak extended and grew to the north from near\n> zenith. The width of the white streaked region grew from a few degrees at a\n> few seconds to about 5\u201310 degrees in 30 seconds. Growth of the auroral\n> region to the north was by addition of new lines developing from west to\n> east. The white-yellow auroral streamers receded upward from the horizon to\n> the north and grew to the south and at about 2 minutes the white-yellow\n> bands were still about 10 degrees wide and extended mainly from near zenith\n> to the south. By about two minutes, the red disc region had completed\n> disappearance in the west and was rapidly fading on the eastern portion of\n> the overhead disc. At 400 seconds essentially all major visible phenomena\n> had disappeared except for possibly some faint red glow along the north-\n> south line and on the horizon to the north. No sounds were heard at Johnston\n> Atoll that could be definitely attributed to the detonation.\n>\n> Strong electromagnetic signals were observed from the burst, as were\n> significant magnetic field disturbances and earth currents.\n\nA 2006 report described the particle and field measurements of the Starfish\ndiamagnetic cavity and the injected beta flux into the artificial radiation\nbelt.^[11] These measurements describe the explosion from 0.1 milliseconds to\n16 minutes after the detonation.\n\n## After effects[edit]\n\nThe explosion released roughly 10^29 electrons into the Earth's\nmagnetosphere.^[12] While some of the energetic beta particles followed the\nEarth's magnetic field and illuminated the sky, other high-energy electrons\nbecame trapped and formed radiation belts around the Earth. The added\nelectrons increased the intensity of electrons within the natural inner Van\nAllen radiation belt by several orders of magnitude.^[12] There was much\nuncertainty and debate^[by whom?] about the composition, magnitude and\npotential adverse effects from the trapped radiation after the detonation. The\nweaponeers became quite worried when three satellites in low Earth orbit were\ndisabled. These included TRAAC and Transit 4B.^[13] The half-life of the\nenergetic electrons was only a few days. At the time it was not known that\nsolar and cosmic particle fluxes varied by a factor of 10, and energies could\nexceed 1 MeV (0.16 pJ). In the months that followed, these man-made radiation\nbelts eventually caused six or more satellites to fail,^[14] as radiation\ndamaged their solar arrays or electronics, including the first commercial\nrelay communication satellite, Telstar, as well as the United Kingdom's first\nsatellite, Ariel 1.^[15] Detectors on Telstar, TRAAC, Injun, and Ariel 1 were\nused to measure distribution of the radiation produced by the tests.^[16]\n\nIn 1963, it was reported that Starfish Prime had created a belt of MeV\nelectrons.^[17] In 1968, it was reported that some Starfish electrons had\nremained in the atmosphere for 5 years.^[18]\n\nAs an explosion in outer space, the fallout from Starfish Prime was less than\nother above ground tests. Estimates for its health impacts and excess deaths,\nincluding from thyroid cancer, are hard to find, but the overall excess death\nimpact of thousands of above-ground tests have likely amounted to between\n10,000 and 100,000. A year later, the US and USSR signed the Partial Nuclear\nTest Ban Treaty, which banned all above-ground nuclear testing. France and\nChina continued above-ground tests for a few more decades.^[19]\n\n## Resulting scientific discoveries[edit]\n\nThe Starfish bomb contained ^109Cd as a tracer, which helped work out the\nseasonal mixing rate of polar and tropical air masses.^[20]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Starfish Prime.\n\n  * List of artificial radiation belts\n  * List of nuclear weapons tests\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Vittitoe, Charles N.
