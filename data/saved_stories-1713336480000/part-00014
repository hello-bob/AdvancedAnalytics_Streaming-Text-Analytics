This feature collects the following\ninfo into LLM prompt.\n\n  * System Info: os, hardware architecture\n  * Path Info: username, current directory, files in directory\n\n### Guess Commands (experimental)\n\nTermax can predict your next move based on your command history, workspace\ninformation, and so on \u2014 just try t guess or termax guess to generate a\nsuggested command. It's not only smart, it's fun!\n\n    \n    \n    t guess\n\nHere is an example that Termax guesses my next move:\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Caution:\n\n  * This feature automatically inserts the last 15 commands from your shell history into the LLM prompt. If your command history contains sensitive information, please refrain from using this feature to ensure your data remains secure.\n\n## Shell Plugin\n\nWe support various shells like bash, zsh, and fish. You can choose to install\nthe plugins by:\n\n    \n    \n    t install -n <plugin>\n\nThe <plugin> can be any of zsh, bash, or fish. With this plugin, you can\ndirectly convert natural language into commands using the Ctrl + K shortcut.\n\nYou can also easily uninstall the plugin by:\n\n    \n    \n    t uninstall -n <plugin>\n\nRemember to source your shell or restart it after installing or uninstalling\nplugins to apply changes.\n\n## Configuration\n\nTermax has a global configuration file that you can customize by editing it.\nBelow is an example of setting up Termax with OpenAI:\n\n    \n    \n    [general] # general configuration platform = openai # default platform auto_execute = False # execute the generated commands automatically show_command = True # show the generated command storage_size = 2000 # the command history's size, default is 2000 [openai] # platform-related configuration model = gpt-3.5-turbo # LLM model api_key = <your API key> # API key temperature = 0.7 save = False\n\nTip\n\n  * The configuration file is stored at <HOME>/.termax, so as the vector database.\n  * For other LLMs than OpenAI, you need to install the client manually.\n  * We utilize ChromaDB as the vector database. When using OpenAI, Termax calculates embeddings with OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002. For other cases, we default to Chroma's built-in model.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor developers, you can install from source code to enable the latest features\nand bug fixes.\n\n    \n    \n    cd <root of this project> pip install -e .\n\nWe are using PEP8 as our coding standard, please read and follow it in case\nthere are CI errors.\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\n\n## About\n\nTermax is an LLM agent in your terminal that converts natural language to\ncommands, enhanced by RAG\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nView license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n30 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n1 fork\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 1\n\n0.1.1 Latest\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 2\n\n  * huangyz0918 Yizheng Huang\n  * SilinMeng0510 Silin Meng\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
