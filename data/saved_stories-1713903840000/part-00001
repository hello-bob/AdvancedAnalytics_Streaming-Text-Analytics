It\u2019s not\nthat my work is particularly interesting or important, there\u2019s a kind of\ninertia that makes it easy for me to sit for extended periods. Such a routine\ncan be harmful to my eyes and may lead to other health issues like\ncardiovascular disease, obesity, back pain, and even mental health problems.\nDespite knowing this, it\u2019s still hard to motivate myself to move my ass.\nHealth issues tend to develop slowly, and taking a break doesn\u2019t provide an\nimmediate reward.\n\nI need prompts to remind me when I\u2019ve been working for too long.\n\nI\u2019ve tried the Pomodoro Technique, but it\u2019s not for me. I think the Pomodoro\nTechnique is better suited for people who are full of energy and have plenty\nof space and time to study and work quietly. My work environment is completely\nunsuitable for it, and with my limited energy, starting a Pomodoro clock feels\ndraining.\n\nI\u2019ve used many timer applications, but the issue with these reminders is that\nthey often go off at inappropriate times. For instance, I might just have\nreturned to my computer and started working for a few minutes before receiving\na reminder. While some software can pause the timer when I\u2019m not at my\ncomputer and resume when I return, the problem is the same, imagine that my\nuse of the computer is definitely not evenly balanced, there will always be\nsome times when I often leave the computer, such as discussing with people,\nworking for a few minutes, then going to the bathroom, then working for a few\nminutes, then going to get some water and so on, and then I return and have\nonly been working for a few minutes, I get a reminder that it\u2019s time to take a\nbreak, this is very thoughtful and it may be just right, but it is not for me,\nin this relatively long period of time I actually have not focused on my\ncomputer nor have I done deep thinking, but I have had plenty of activities.\n\nTiming is important, but the \u2019timing\u2019 is equally crucial.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be overly disturbed or distracted by another thing, nor do I\nwant to be constrained by any particular time management methodology. I prefer\nto follow my own flow, even though it can get a bit wild at times. Therefore,\nI need some feedback to help me make adjustments.\n\nSo, I decided to develop an application for myself. Initially, all I had was a\nmessy \u201cdo not want\u201d list:\n\n  * No need to manually start the timer.\n  * No need to manually reset the timer to adapt to my own rhythm.\n  * No timing or progress information that I can immediately see.\n  * No countdown during breaks.\n  * No \u201cpre-reminder\u201d (buffer/double reminder) to tell me that the break is about to begin.\n  * Don\u2019t disturb me when I\u2019m using certain software.\n  * Don\u2019t disturb me when I\u2019m watching a video.\n  * Don\u2019t disturb me when I\u2019m just getting into a state.\n\nIn my imagination, this application is not based on timing, I mean, it is\nstill based on timing, but on top of that, my activity level takes precedence.\nIt times only when I am active - stops timing when I am inactive - and starts\ntiming again when I am active again. Hmm - the timing is about my continuous\nactive duration on my computer - it stops and resets when I stop. So, I get a\nreminder when I\u2019ve been active for too long.\n\nThe core function is relatively simple, its working principle has only a\nslight difference from others, but in my personal view, this difference is\nsignificant enough to impact the product experience. Some people may indeed\nfeel that this application is flawed, and a lot of the time, it seems like it\ndoes not work at all. This is also the reason why I wrote this article.\n\nMy daily work routine is simple, most of the time, I\u2019m either using the\nbrowser or the terminal, I do use other applications like chat and note-taking\napplications. My coding work mostly occurs in the terminal, where I mainly use\nthe keyboard. When using the browser, there\u2019s a lot of clicking and scrolling.\nI\u2019ve noticed (the sound) that colleagues who aren\u2019t involved in coding do a\nlot of clicking as well. So I believe monitoring activity doesn\u2019t need to be\noverly complicated. However, implementing this idea took quite some time, from\nthe \u201cdo not want\u201d list to writing the first line of code was a lengthy\nprocess, and it has been half a year since the first version was developed.\n\nThis is an activity statistic function I added recently, which can roughly\nshow my activity on some Friday and how this application works (it is a macOS\napp called TotalPause):\n\nBlue is my active time, purple is TotalPause\u2019s prompts. TotalPause reminds me\nunder two conditions: one is when I am not active, and the other is when I\nhave been using the computer for too long. Here I\u2019ll explain this picture a\nbit:\n\n  * 10:14 start the day\u2019s work, my brain is empty, TotalPause prompts, then I went to get some water\n  * 10:21 still, did not get into the state immediately\n  * 10:25 start working\n  * 11:10 continuously worked for 45 minutes, TotalPause prompts, just went to the bathroom\n  * 12:06 end of the work, went to lunch\n  * 14:03 started the afternoon\u2019s work and continuously worked for 45 minutes, TotalPause prompts, went to get some water\n  * 14:52 continue the work, continuously worked for 45 minutes, TotalPause reminded me to break again, hesitated for a moment and still went to get a cup of water\n  * 15:40 worked for more than 20 minutes, I took a walk by myself, TotalPause launched a reminder when I left\n  * 16:24 continue the work for another 45 minutes, TotalPause prompts, I should have gone to the bathroom or got some water\n  * 17:13 continue the work\n  * 17:37 end of work, went to dinner, it is raining outside\n  * 17:55 continue the work, finishing up\n  * 18:02 went to some water, TotalPause prompted when I left\n  * 18:05 came back to browse the web, TotalPause reminded me 45 minutes later, went to get some water again\n  * 18:53 continue to browse the web\n  * 19:06 a short discussion with colleague\n  * 19:09 went to the gym, then TotalPause launched a reminder when I was not there\n  * 20:20 returned to my seat, still raining, tidied up and then left\n\nThis is TotalPause\u2019s prompt:\n\nThe prompt is very simple, it covers all displays in full screen. The text\nclearly states how long I have been working continuously - this duration is\nvery important. I\u2019ve found that if this duration isn\u2019t displayed, I\u2019m likely\nto quickly ignore the prompt. The prompt cannot be dismissed using shortcut\nkeys, it can only be closed by clicking the button with the mouse. Adding this\nlittle difficulty effectively makes me aware of my working time and have a\nquick debate in my head.\n\nSome people might think this doesn\u2019t look good as a screensaver, wondering\nwhat good the prompt is if you\u2019ve just left the computer.\n\nClicking the button above the text starts an animation that can be used for\nbreathing exercises (hopefully I will implement a meditation/breathing effect\nsimilar to the Apple Watch), this feature is also inspired by Sit. and One\nMinute Focus. Doing nothing and thinking nothing is quite challenging if\nyou\u2019ve ever tried it, which is why TotalPause defaults to launching a prompt\nwhen I\u2019m not active. For example, waking up the computer to start work might\nneed a buffer, and returning to the computer with the breathing exercises can\nhelp to calm down.\n\nThe last thing: the do not disturb function when watching videos might produce\nfalse positives if video websites has some animated ads or banners, leading it\nto assume you\u2019re watching videos when you\u2019re not. However, if I\u2019m inactive and\nnot actually watching videos, it is acceptable to me not to receive a prompt.\nConversely, if I have been active for a long time and just opened a\npreconfigured website with these ads, then oops, I may fix this in the future.\n\nThis application is not likely to be suitable for everyone, some might find it\na bit strange at times and think it doesn\u2019t work, this is correct, what suits\noneself is the best. Give it a try to see for yourself: TotalPause on the Mac\nApp Store (it is a one-time purchase, free until Apr 26, 2024. I believe the\ntime zone handling is managed by Apple, although I\u2019m not entirely sure how\nthat works).\n\n@damnever. All Rights Reserved. CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n", "frontpage": false}
