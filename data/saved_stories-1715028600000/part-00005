Today I\u2019m charting an\nalternative past for energy production in Germany.\n\nOn March 11, 2011, at 2:46pm, 72km east off the Japanese coast, the ocean\nfloor shook. The strongest earthquake ever recorded in Japan lasted six\nminutes. Fifty minutes later, waves 13 meters high hit the Fukushima Daiichi\nnuclear power plant, one of the biggest power plants in the world, located on\nthe coast to use the seawater to cool the reactors, designed to withstand\ntsunamis peaking at 5 meters. The reactor cooling system failed; radioacticity\nreleased, and Japanese authorities evacuated everyone within a 30km radius.\n\nThe world was in shock. On the other side of the planet, in Germany, this\nhappened:\n\nNuclear power is not a renewable energy source, but it's a clean one \u2013 in\nfacts, it's one of the cleanest energy sources (in terms of greenhouse gas\nemission), and one of the safest (1 person died from radioactivity after\nFukushima, compared to millions who die every year from air pollution caused\nby burning fossil fuels); similar to solar and wind power \u2013 but more space-\nefficient and less weather-dependent.\n\nBut Germans have never really warmed up to nuclear energy. The 1986 Chernobyl\ndisaster hit close to home, and showed the constant risk. The anti-nuclear\nmovement was strong even before that, pointing out that there's no sustainable\nlong-term solution for getting rid of the radioactive waste. Many of its\nsupporters helped found the Green Party in 1980 that is in government since\n2021. Within days of the Fukushima accident, Germans wanted to get out of\nnuclear power \u2013 and fast. The German government responded. As of last April,\nGermany doesn't produce nuclear energy anymore.\n\nBut maybe that was a mistake. Germans have been telling pollsters for years\nthat they want to get out of nuclear power, but now they are having second\nthoughts. In April 2023, the month the last nuclear reactor was shut down,\nnearly 60% of polled people said it was wrong to phase out nuclear power. (In\nthe U.S., too, more people started to support more nuclear energy production.)\n\n\"So...maybe we should go back to nuclear?\" is something that not only the\ngreen German vice chancellor and climate minister is getting asked more and\nmore in interviews.\n\nI wanted to understand where we in Germany could be now if we had never turned\nour backs on nuclear energy in the first place:\n\nIn theory, nuclear power could have completely replaced coal and lignite in\nGermany by last year, resulting in 83% clean energy (France, with its many\nnuclear reactors, produced 93% clean energy in 2023).\n\nOf course, that's an oversimplified calculation. It doesn't take into account\nthe many political, technical, and economic constraints. But like any good\nthought experiment, it gets you thinking: Was Germany's decision after\nFukushima the right one? Considering all the pros and cons, what's \"worse\":\nfossil fuels or nuclear power?\n\nNext week, look for a Weekly Chart from my coworker from the support &\ncustomer success team, Shaylee.
