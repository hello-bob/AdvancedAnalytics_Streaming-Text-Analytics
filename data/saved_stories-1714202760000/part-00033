There was a quality of alert focus that came with it, as\nwell as a gregariousness that would fuel bonding sessions with my other all-\nnight companions. After we\u2019d turned in the products of our midnight oil to our\nprofessors, we would all head out for pancakes. Then I\u2019d go home and sleep the\nmagic off.\n\nFor years, I\u2019d wondered if there was any basis for this temporary euphoria\nthat I\u2014though certainly not all my classmates\u2014experienced after those\nsleepless nights. That I should feel so expansive and goofy after skipping\nsleep while many of them turned into drowsy grouches seemed to defy logic.\nGoing without sleep isn\u2019t supposed to be a good thing, especially for folks\nwho experience depression, as I have.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

In 1818, University of Leipzig psychiatrist Johann Christian August\nHeinroth was reportedly the first to suggest that partial or total sleep\ndeprivation could be temporarily effective against \u201cmelancholia,\u201d as\ndepression was called in those days. He found this to be true only in a\ncertain subset of patients\u2014around 60 percent. More than a hundred years later,\nin the 1970s, evidence emerged that a \u201cresynchronization\u201d of disturbed\ncircadian rhythms could be responsible for the improved moods of depressed\npatients after a night without sleep. And more recently, researchers have\nfound that a neurotransmitter involved in reward known as dopamine may play a\nrole in this effect, as may neuroplasticity\u2014the nervous system\u2019s ability to\nrearrange itself in response to stimuli. But the precise neural mechanisms\nresponsible have remained unclear.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nLast summer, Philip Gehrman, a professor of clinical psychology at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, and his colleagues, published a study in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that provides further evidence\nfor the phenomenon and suggests that closer connections between certain brain\nregions may have something to do with it. The researchers found that one night\nof total lack of sleep can temporarily boost mood in some healthy and\ndepressed people, and that these individuals show greater connectivity between\nthe amygdala, which processes emotion and memory, and the anterior cingulate\ncortex, which is responsible for decision making and learning.\n\nGehrman warned me that none of us\u2014especially those suffering from\ndepression\u2014should try to self-medicate by pushing through until dawn. But he\nsays his findings could help scientists identify other forms of therapy for\nthe condition, which is so difficult to treat. \u201cWhat our results suggest is\nthat therapeutic sleep deprivation may directly target these circuits,\u201d says\nGehrman. \u201cIf we can find a way to target those circuits in ways other than\nwith sleep deprivation, it may be possible to develop treatments for\ndepression that are both rapid but more sustained than sleep deprivation.\u201d\n\nOne of these, Gehrman proposed, might be an approach known as transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation, which uses magnetic waves delivered from outside the\nskull to stimulate nerve cells in the brain involved in mood control. Thus\nfar, such treatments have been tricky to use because the magnetic waves have\nto hit very precise areas of the brain to be effective. Still, Gerhman says\nthat circuits that respond to sleep deprivation could potentially serve as\nvaluable future targets for magnetic stimulation, though this approach would\nneed to be tested in clinical trials first.\n\nFor the study, Gehrman and his team evaluated 30 people with major depressive\ndisorder while they underwent sleep deprivation. He also observed another 54\npeople without depression, 16 of whom slept normally throughout the study and\nwere used as controls. Over a five-day period, Gehrman and his colleagues\nperformed three resting-state-functional magnetic resonance imaging\u2014or RS\nfMRI\u2014scans on all participants to track blood oxygen delivery to the brain.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

The\n16 non-depressed control subjects went through the same series of scans but\nslept normally all four nights. Throughout this period, when awake, the\nparticipants completed questionnaires to assess their moods every two hours. A\nlittle less than half, or 43 percent, of the depressed participants reported a\nmood improvement after staying up all night. But most of those who didn\u2019t\nsuffer from depression said their moods got worse.\n\nJust as curious as the antidepressant effect of staying up all night is the\nfact that not everyone can experience it. Stanford neurologist Robert\nSapolsky, who has long studied the biology of depression and sleep, confessed\nin an email that the results of the Gehrman and other studies \u201cseemed\ncompletely counterintuitive to me, insofar as a wide range of chronic\nstressors (e.g., sleep deprivation) bias toward depression.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he finds the idea hard to dismiss. \u201cIt\u2019s solid and replicated,\u201d\nSapolsky wrote. \u201cI think the keys are that it is only a night\u2019s worth, isn\u2019t\nlong lasting, and only works in a subset of people. Real progress will come\nwhen people figure out what it is about that subset that matters.\u201d\n\nGehrman acknowledged that what separates those for whom therapeutic sleep\ndeprivation is effective and those who just get cranky and want to go to sleep\nis a mystery as old as Heinroth\u2019s first observations of the effect.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Even with their own findings, it\u2019s difficult to know which\ncomes first\u2014higher connectivity between the two brain regions, or improved\nmood. \u201cWe focused on the circuit-level changes, but those changes may have\noccurred because of underlying changes in dopamine activity,\u201d Gehrman says.\nEither way, he and his colleagues believe that neuroplasticity likely has\nsomething to do with it.\n\nAs I type this in the wee hours before sunrise, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about\nGehrman\u2019s findings\u2014and about the sun coming up.\n\nLead image: PODIS / Shutterstock\n\n  * ###### Charles Digges\n\nPosted on March 26, 2024\n\nCharles Digges is an environmental journalist and researcher who edits\nBellona.org, the website of the Norwegian environmental group Bellona.\n\n#### Get the Nautilus newsletter\n\nCutting-edge science, unraveled by the very brightest living thinkers.\n\nCommunication\n\nHow Whales Could Help Us Speak to Aliens\n\nPhysics\n\nMaking Light of Gravity\n\nHistory\n\nThe Age of Rebellion\n\n  * Explore\n\n## Can Chatbots Hold Meaningful Conversations?\n\n    * By Elena Kazamia\n    * April 5, 2024\n    * Technology\n\nTraining AI to read novels might help.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## What a Bronze Age Skeleton Reveals About Cavities\n\n    * By Katharine Gammon\n    * April 4, 2024\n    * History\n\nHere\u2019s a hint: He didn\u2019t eat processed foods and sugar.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## Archaeology at the Bottom of the Sea\n\n    * By David Gibbins\n    * April 2, 2024\n    * History\n\nDavid Gibbins on his 3 greatest revelations while writing A History of the\nWorld in Twelve Shipwrecks.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## How a Total Eclipse Alters Your Psyche\n\n    * By Joel Frohlich\n    * April 1, 2024\n    * Astronomy\n\nThe importance of feeling small and insignificant.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## When Bacteria Are Beautiful\n\n    * By Kristen French\n    * March 28, 2024\n    * Arts\n\nMaking art out of an invisible world that shapes human health and disease.\n\n## NAUTILUS: SCIENCE CONNECTED\n\nNautilus is a different kind of science magazine.
