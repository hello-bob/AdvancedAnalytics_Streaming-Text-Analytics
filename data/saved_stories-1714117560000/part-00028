Here is my response.\n\n(1) On the March 2019 core update claim in the piece: This is baseless\nspeculation. The March 2019 core update was designed to improve the quality of\nour search results, as all core updates are designed to do. It is incorrect to\nsay it rolled back our quality or our anti-spam protections, which we've\ndeveloped over many years and continue to improve upon.\n\nCalling this \u201cbaseless speculation\u201d is equal parts unfair and ahistorical. To\nquote Google, as quoted by Barry Schwartz of Search Engine Land, Google\u2019s\nMarch 2019 was \u201cnot the biggest update [Google has] released,\u201d and in that\narticle, Schwartz even suggests that this update might have been a case where\nGoogle \u201creverses the previous core updates,\u201d which resulted in a Google\nspokesperson saying that it was\u201cconstantly improving our algorithms and build\nforward to improve,\u201d which is most assuredly not a denial. In the event it is\na denial, Google should be clear about it.\n\nFurthermore, I linked to several sources \u2014 including Roger Monti of Search\nEngine Journal \u2014 who on March 14 2019 referred to the March 2019 core update\nas \u201cbehaving like a rollback of previous updates.\u201d Monti also quoted Brett\nTabke of WebMasterWorld, who said, and I quote, \u201cI think we may be seeing a\nrollback of a few of the last updates.\u201d Monti also published another article\ncalled \u201cData Confirms Why Google March 2019 Update Feels Like a Rollback\u201d on\nMarch 16, 2019, which referred to an indepth report from SEO tool company\nSistrix that found that \u201c75% of winners were previous losers...that means that\n75% of the websites that improved in rankings in this update were sites that\nlost rankings in previous updates of 2018.\u201d\n\nWhile Monti claims that \u201cthis may look like a rollback, it\u2019s highly unlikely,\u201d\nhe also adds that \u201cwhatever changes were made appear like a rollback.\u201d\n\nGoogle can play semantics all it wants, but if changes were made to an\nalgorithm that increased traffic to previously-suppressed sites, how does one\ninterpret these changes as anything other than a rollback, especially when\nthese sites were suppressed in previous updates?\n\nThe one party that could actually clear this up with meaningful data and\nthorough explanations is Google, and it has instead chosen to vaguely and\nunilaterally state that I was incorrect. This is both deeply offensive to the\npeople that report on the Search Engine Optimization industry for a living,\nand those affected by the opaque and mercurial updates made to Google Search.\n\nFurthermore, in another email revealed as part of the Department of Justice\u2019s\nantitrust trial, where Jerry Dischler on 5/3/2019, Jerry Dischler asks Anil\nSabharwal, then the Vice President and General Manager of Chrome on an email\nincluding Prabhakar Raghavan, Nick Fox, Ben Gomes, and several other Googlers,\nwhether it was \u201cworth reconsidering a rollback,\u201d and that he didn\u2019t want the\nmessage to be \u201cwe\u2019re doing this thing because the Ads team needs revenue\u201d in a\nsentence referring to the ads team asking the Search and Chrome teams to do\nstuff to increase revenue.\n\nIn fact, one of the previous emails that Dischler sends \u2014 specifically one\nwhere he adds Prabhakar Raghavan \u2014 refers to Google\u2019s ads division having \u201ctwo\nobjects in all of these discussions,\u201d one of them being reversing the \u201csudden\nquery-driven revenue loss that they saw in Q3\u201d of 2018.\n\nWhile these emails are to do with both Chrome and search, they show Dischler\u2019s\nwillingness to suggest rollbacks in search, and his \u2014 as part of the executive\nteam on Google\u2019s ads side \u2014 willingness to push around the search team.\n\n(2) As we have stated definitively: the organic results you see in Search are\nnot affected by our ads systems.\n\nI take several issues with this statement.\n\n  1. Google has never \u201cdefinitively\u201d stated anything about the organic results in search, and \u2014 like many tech companies \u2014 keeps a relatively tight lid on how search works.\n  2. Google is also once again playing with semantics here. While the \u201corganic results you see in search\u201d may not be affected by its ad systems, the emails revealed by the Department of Justice show that Google Search is affected, influenced and required to act at the behest of the advertising and finance divisions of Google.\n\n    1. In an email from Ben Gomes to Nick Fox and Shashi Thakur sent 11:10am on 2/6/2019, Gomes states that \u201cwe\u201d (referring to search) \u201care getting too involved with ads for the good of the product and the company.\u201d\n\n      1. In the same email, Gomes says that search was \u201cgetting too close to the money.\u201d\n    2. In the same email chain, in an email sent at 9:56PM on 2/5/2019, Nick Fox tells Gomes and Thakur that \u201c[his] guess is that all these requests aren't going to subside. Given that (a) [they are] responsible for Search, (b) Search is the revenue engine of the company, and (c) revenue is weak, it seems like this is [their] new reality of [their] jobs.\u201d The requests in question were referring to those made by Jerry Dischler, then the Vice President and General Manager of Ads for Google and Kristen Gil, then Google\u2019s Vice President Business Finance Officer.\n    3. In Gomes\u2019 drafted email to Prabhakar Raghavan from 3/23/2019, Raghavan \u2014 the head of ads at the time, talking to the head of search \u2014 says that \u201cthe full year plan is a bad miss and will need drastic steps on the query side,\u201d a statement that suggests that while Google\u2019s advertising \u201csystems\u201d may not affect results, the people in power in ads absolutely did.\n\nAs an aside, you will notice that Google\u2019s response also never once raises\nanything around Prabhakar Raghavan, the subject of the article.\n\nTestimonial Examples:\n\nI found it peculiar that Google responded with unlinked and uncited\ntestimonies \u201cfrom the DOJ trial that puts these misleading claims in context.\u201d\nI will now go through each quote.\n\nFrom Ben Gomes' testimony:\n\n\u2022 \"From my perspective, queries had always been a tricky way to measure\ngrowth, because there are changes you can make that actually reduce the number\nof queries but are good for users. So I never liked the notion of pure queries\nas a growth metric, but we also needed to agree on, like, what was the right\ngrowth metric. And so this was a discussion about exactly what could be a good\nmetric.\"\n\n\u2022 \"I think this metric of using just queries is not one that optimizes\nappropriately... Ads also wants users for the long run, they also want long\nterm business.\"\n\n\u2022 \"We have no way of growing queries directly unless we do a better job with\nsearch.\"\n\n\u2022 \"I was proposing things we would never do, like turning off spell\ncorrection. I could never imagine us doing that.\"\n\n\u2022 \"We were putting a significant effort into ideas that we thought would\nincrease the amount -- satisfy more user needs and increase the amount of\nusage we had in search. Those two things are not necessarily at odds.\"\n\nThese quotes, if anything, directly illustrate the issues that Gomes raised in\nthe emails I\u2019ve cited, specifically the concern about more queries not being a\ngood metric for Google Search to aspire to. The people asking for \u201cmore\nqueries\u201d were from the ads side of Google, and Gomes\u2019 testimony doesn\u2019t add\nany further context, other than that he \u201ccould never imagine\u201d turning off\nspell check on Google \u2014 something I did not suggest Google had done. I was, in\nfact, quoting Gomes\u2019 emails.\n\nFrom Jerry Dischler's testimony:\n\nQ: Do agree that the search team and the ads team are working together to\naccelerate monetization velocity, correct?\n\nA: \"The ads team would be accelerating monetization velocity. The search team\nis only accelerating monetization velocity to the extent that they tell the\nads team about what new research they're building.\"\n\nQ: ...by \"church and state separation,\" can you just further describe what\nthat means?\n\nA: \"What I mean is that the organic team does not take data from the ads team\nin order to affect its ranking and affect its result. The organic team\noperates independently.\"\n\nThese quotes do not refute anything I have said. The third answer, however,\nshows yet another attempt by Google to play with semantics. Dischler says that\n\u201cthe organic team does not take data from the ads team in order to affect its\nranking and affects its results,\u201d and that the \u201corganic team operates\nindependently.\u201d\n\nThis is a deliberate obfuscation of the structure of Google, and is an attempt\nto get around the truth \u2014 that Dischler and the ads side of Google have\nrepeatedly pushed around the search team, as evidenced by the previously-cited\nemail thread revealed as part of the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust trial.\n\nOn 3/5/2019, Dischler stated that he was \u201csuper proud of our pure approach at\nGoogle and don't want to poison the culture of any team, and this is why I\nhaven't pushed harder. I also don't want the message to be '\u2019we're doing this\nthing because the Ads team needs revenue.\u2019 That's a very negative message. But\nmy question to all of you is \u2014 based on above \u2014 what do we think is the best\ndecision for Google overall?\u201d\n\nDischler continues, asking the CC\u2019d Googlers whether it\u2019s \u201cworth reconsidering\na rollback\u201d and requests \u201cscrappy tactical tweaks\u201d that they \u201cknow will\nincrease queries,\u201d before suggesting a change to search that \u201cincreases the\nvertical space between the search box, icons and feed on a new tab to make\nsearch more prominent.\u201d\n\nI do not know what Google is suggesting about the \u201corganic team\u201d \u201ctaking data\nfrom the ads team.\u201d It is ahistorical \u2014 and, as the emails reveal, untrue \u2014 to\nsuggest that the organic search team \u201coperates independently.\u201d\n\nShare\n\nAbout the author\n\n### Edward Zitron\n\nView all\n\nComments\n\n## Welcome to Where's Your Ed At!\n\nSubscribe today.
