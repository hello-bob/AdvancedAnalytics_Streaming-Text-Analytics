Several\nemployees describe the situation as Elon Musk \u201cthrowing his weight around\u201d to\nsolidify his status after being mostly absent over the last year.\n\nBut he is coming in like a dangerous wrecking ball.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told Electrek that Musk was not as frequently\npresent at Tesla as he used to be over the last year and since his acquisition\nof Twitter.\n\nThat has changed over the last few weeks.\n\nMusk is now all over Tesla or at least, his presence is being felt everywhere\nat Tesla.\n\nIt started with the first wave of layoffs two weeks ago. Musk announced that\nTesla would be laying off about 10% of its workforce and used his usual excuse\nof growing the headcount too fast, resulting in hiring inefficiencies with\nduplicate jobs.\n\nHowever, when we first heard about those plans a day prior, we heard that the\nlayoffs could be closer to 20% of the workforce.\n\nSure enough, the layoffs are still ongoing.\n\nTesla started another wave of layoffs this week \u2013 including the entire\ncharging organization.\n\nNow, Electrek has learned that Musk also gutted Tesla\u2019s cathode material\nmanufacturing team in Texas.\n\nIt started with Anthony Thurston, Senior Manager, Cathode Materials &\nManufacturing at Tesla, earlier this month, but Electrek has learned that Musk\nhas now let go of most of the team.\n\nSources familiar with the matter describe a difficult situation at Tesla right\nnow. Uncertainty, confusion, and frustration are the main feelings going\naround the offices.\n\n> What I'm hearing within Tesla right now is uncertainty, confusion, and\n> frustration.\n>\n> Restructuring is never easy, and there's a good argument that Tesla, like\n> many companies, needs to restructure to face the imminent impact of AI.\n>\n> However, there's also the argument that this...\n>\n> \u2014 Fred Lambert (@FredericLambert) April 30, 2024\n\nSeveral sources confirmed that there are rumors around Tesla that the vehicle\nengineering and design departments are next.\n\nDuring Tesla\u2019s earnings call last week, Musk commented a bit more on the\nlayoffs. This time, he said it was about \u201creorganizing\u201d the company:\n\n> We\u2019ve made some corrections along the way. But it is time to reorganize the\n> company for the next phase of growth and you really need to reorganize it.\n\nAnalysts and Tesla fans are trying to understand the logic behind some of\nthese moves and the firing of almost the entire charging organization, around\n500 people, has been hard to understand for most people.\n\nMusk said that Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network but with a\nfocus on existing stations:\n\n> Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace\n> for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing\n> locations\n>\n> \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 30, 2024\n\nWe reported that Tesla has already backed out of leases for new Supercharger\nstations.\n\nSources say that Tesla will have issues continuing to grow the network without\nthe organization of Rebecca Tinucci, Tesla\u2019s former head of charging.\n\nIn the past, Tesla rehired people it fired after realizing that it couldn\u2019t\nget the work done without them.\n\nThis is raising questions about the logic behind some of the layoffs and their\nefficacy.\n\nSources familiar with the matter believe that some of the layoffs have nothing\nto do with hiring inefficiencies or restructuring, but rather with Musk\nthrowing his weight around Tesla.\n\nTwo sources told Electrek that Tinucci was fighting back pressure from Musk to\nfire a bigger percentage of her team, and the CEO decided to let go of the\nentire team as an example.\n\nMusk wrote in an email to executives on Sunday:\n\n> \u201cHopefully, these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely\n> hard-core about headcount and cost reduction. While some on exec staff are\n> taking this seriously, most are not yet doing so.\u201d\n\nThe message is clear: fire people as many people as I\u2019m asking, or you and\nyour entire team will be gone.\n\n## Electrek\u2019s Take\n\nThis is clearly about more than hiring inefficiency and restructuring. Musk is\ncleaning house. It could be that he has serious concerns about the economy and\nlack of reversal for Tesla\u2019s sales in the short term, but he didn\u2019t go into\nthat in the earnings call last week.\n\nIt could be about more than that. I don\u2019t know if I completely agree with the\ntheory that Musk is securing his leadership position at Tesla, but it is a\nviable theory.\n\nAs I previously presented, the vote on his compensation package is turning\ninto a vote of confidence in the CEO.\n\nThese layoffs are useful for him on that front. A lot of the leadership is\ngone. With every leader leaving, Musk becomes more needed at Tesla. Also, it\ndoesn\u2019t hurt that all these leaders are unloading their stocks, which won\u2019t be\nvoted against him.\n\nHowever, it raises the question: is it actually good for Tesla?\n\nThe Supercharger team did something incredible: build the only successful and\nliked fast-charging network in North America, which is critical to EV\nadoption.\n\nFiring the entire team because the head was pushing back on the number of\nlayoffs is ridiculous, especially if the plan is still to grow the network.\nTesla needs to grow the network since it is currently onboarding other\nautomakers on it. Even if Tesla sees its own sales slowing down, the\nSupercharger network will need a capacity increase.\n\nEveryone I talked to at Tesla says that it is a complete mess. Contractors for\nmost ongoing Supercharger projects lost their point of contact at Tesla.\nAgain, many suspect Tesla will try to rehire some of the workers fired.\n\nTesla has hiring inefficiencies leading to layoffs and layoffs inefficiencies\nleading to new hires.\n\nIt\u2019s not a good look.\n\n## Top comment by Les Inanchy\n\nLiked by 52 people\n\nIn 60 years of buying cars, I don\u2019t think I gave 2 seconds of thought to the\nCEOs of the company\u2019s that made these cars. I bought cars that fit my\nlifestyle and taste, since there were not that many differences in technology.\nI didn\u2019t care about the CEOs families - wives, mothers, children, or\ngirlfriends - or their Politics, which they typically kept quiet about.\n\nOur Tesla was the first American Made car I purchased in all those years. It\nwas also the first car I bought for the technology, not to mention we liked\nthe styling.\n\nFor me, although I can appreciate Elon\u2019s contribution to the auto and space\nindustries, he has gotten to be a distraction. I worry that all the progress\nmade in the transformation of the auto industry will be negatively affected by\nhis actions.\n\nView all comments\n\nThe only way I can get behind Musk on this is if Tesla\u2019s financials are really\nin the dumpster. It doesn\u2019t look that bad right now based on the financial\nstatements, but it\u2019s not impossible that Tesla has internal numbers, like\norders coming in, that look awful.\n\nSome of this reminds me of Tesla in 2019. Things were looking pretty good, but\nTesla launched a huge cost-cutting effort. We later learned that Tesla was on\nthe verge of bankruptcy because it didn\u2019t anticipate how costly it would be to\nlaunch Model 3 in high volume in Europe.\n\nThe long transit time put a lot of financial pressure on Tesla, and the cost-\ncutting effort was intended to compensate for that \u2013 Musk didn\u2019t communicate\nto shareholders until later.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s something similar going on that we don\u2019t know about, but at the\nsame time, Tesla is in a completely different situation right now, sitting on\n$27 billion in cash.\n\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
