The Double Life of Former Wirecard Executive Jan\nMarsalek\n\nSince the collapse of Wirecard, Jan Marsalek has been on the run and is one of\nthe most wanted men in the world. A DER SPIEGEL investigation has revealed how\nhe went underground and that he's a Russian spy.\n\nBy J\u00f6rg Diehl, Roman Dobrokhotov, Christo Grozev, Martin Hesse, Roman H\u00f6fner,\nMartin Knobbe, Christoph Giesen, Roman Lehberger, Friederike R\u00f6hreke, Fabian\nSchmid, Fidelius Schmid, Marcel Rosenbach, Thomas Schulz, Sandra Sperber und\nFinn Starken\n\n05.03.2024, 14.49 Uhr\n\n  * X.com\n  * Facebook\n  * E-Mail\n  * Messenger\n  * WhatsApp\n\n  * E-Mail\n  * Messenger\n  * WhatsApp\n\nIt\u2019s the middle of summer in Nice, and the Mediterranean is lapping gently\nagainst the walls of the quay. A man with shortly trimmed dark hair in a black\nsuit and a radiant white shirt is striding briskly toward a cutter. A second\nman is carrying his case. An attractive woman \u2013 tall and blond, her summer\ndress fluttering in the wind \u2013 is pacing on the aft deck of the Poseidon III,\nlaughing nervously. Her name is Natalya Zlobina, and she is the Russian lover\nof Jan Marsalek, one of the most-wanted men in Europe.\n\nDER SPIEGEL 10/2024\n\nThe article you are reading originally appeared in German in issue 10/2024\n(March 2nd, 2024) of DER SPIEGEL.\n\nSPIEGEL International\n\nThe scene, recorded by a camera at the Port of Nice, becomes a bit blurry. The\nman in the black suit climbs down a ladder to the Poseidon III and greets the\nwoman with a kiss. She laughs; he seems annoyed. Now, it's possible to\nrecognize his face, well-known these days from the wanted posters plastered on\nthe walls of train stations and airports: It is Jan Marsalek himself, the\nformer COO of Wirecard, which was once listed on Germany\u2019s blue-chip stock\nindex, the DAX. He has been on the run since June 2020.\n\nThe moment hardly lasts a minute, and it can be seen in the video that the\nwoman quickly makes it clear to him that the cutter is just part of a little\nprank. The real ship is rocking in the waves one slip over \u2013 a luxurious mega-\nyacht, of course, where a group of laughing men is waiting. Later, Zlobina\nwill celebrate her 30th birthday here. It is July 6, 2014, the day on which\nJan Marsalek\u2019s life will change. The day on which he will meet a man with\nexcellent ties to the Russian military secret service agency GRU, and on which\nhe will apparently begin his second life as a spy.\n\nMarsalek\u2019s story has thus far been more of a financial thriller, already an\nalmost unbelievable tale of fraud, lies and deception. A story of a school\ndropout rising to become the COO of the financial company Wirecard, a firm\nconsidered for a time as one of the most powerful newcomers to the German\neconomy in decades, courted by government ministers and premiers. But\nWirecard\u2019s success, as would become clear, was a sham. Billions of euros in\naccount balances evaporated, almost 6,000 people lost their jobs and top\nexecutives were arrested.\n\nThe drama is now taking a bizarre turn, the plot gets even crazier. Suddenly,\nthe financial thriller has become a spy thriller. And the main character is no\nlonger a charismatic trickster, but a villain straight out of a James Bond\nmovie, cynical and dangerous. A man who is still on the run today. But where\nis he? And how has he managed to escape the authorities all this time?\n\nJoint reporting by DER SPIEGEL, German public broadcaster ZDF, the Austrian\nnewspaper Der Standard and the Russian investigative platform The Insider has\nnow found some answers. On the basis of confidential documents, mobile phone\ndata, travel records, lab results, investigation files, emails and chats,\nMarsalek\u2019s story can now be told in its entirety. Marsalek isn\u2019t just the main\ncharacter in one of Germany\u2019s largest ever financial scandals. He is also \u2013 so\nit would seem from interviews with secret service agents, police investigators\nand people from his orbit \u2013 a spy working for the Kremlin. A man whose\nactivities in his role as an agent endangers lives. Marsalek has apparently\ncommissioned Bulgarian accomplices to track Moscow\u2019s critics across all of\nEurope, spy on them and possibly even eliminate them. The plot was uncovered\nat the last moment by the British domestic intelligence agency MI5.\n\nMarsalek\u2019s ties to Russian secret service agencies go back an entire decade.\nIt seems that he was initially recruited by the GRU, but he is also thought to\nhave worked for the KGB\u2019s successor agency, the FSB, in recent years. Zlobina,\nhis girlfriend, is also in touch with men from the security services. Over the\nseveral years Marsalek spent as the head of a DAX-listed company, he was\napparently able to quietly expand his spying network, traveling to Russia on\nmore than 60 occasions and using six Austrian passports and a diplomatic\ndocument to do so.\n\nThere are plenty of indications that Marsalek also involved Wirecard in\nRussian intelligence activities \u2013 that money was laundered and mercenaries\nwere paid through the company. Was Marsalek using Germany\u2019s model company to\nhelp an adversarial power? Did a DAX-listed company assist in the waging of\nwar? How did all this take place without German intelligence officials taking\nnotice?\n\nJan Marsalek\u2019s tracks lead into a shrill parallel world that feels at times\nlike a poorly lit B movie. At others, it slips into the horror genre. It\nincludes scenes with flights in MiG fighter jets and rocket-propelled grenades\nare fired in Syria. And others with champagne parties on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur and\nmercenary armies are recruited in Libya. Characters include agents, nude\nmodels, mercenaries, politicians, psychopaths and murderers.\n\nAnd a Russian priest who has astounding similarities to Jan Marsalek.\n\n### THE PRIEST\n\nHalfway between Moscow and Rostov-on-Don lies the city of Lipetsk. Founded in\nthe early 18th century by Peter the Great, it is home to half a million\nresidents today. At a traffic circle on the way into the center of town is a\ncharming, 200-year-old chapel with a golden dome and a fa\u00e7ade colored brightly\nin yellow, blue and white. Twice a day except for Tuesdays, a priest named\nKonstantin Bayazov holds services there. He has a dark beard and shortly\ntrimmed hair. If you watch the priest during his services, you start seeing\nsimilarities to Marsalek, and the two men\u2019s birthdays are also just a single\nyear apart. The parallels were also apparently noticed by Russian secret\nservice agents.\n\nMarsalek's Russian passport, passport file, Pastor Konstantin Bayazov\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Fotos: DER SPIEGEL (3)\n\nBayazov \u2013 the real Bayazov \u2013 hasn\u2019t used his own passport since September\n2020. Because since then, there has been a second Bayazov, a fake one. The\npassport file was changed on September 5, 2020, and a new passport was issued\nwith the number 763391844. Both the file and the travel document now include\nthe scowling image of Jan Marsalek.\n\nFrom the passport files of Konstantin Bayazov: Photos of the priest and of the\nfugitive Marsalek\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Fotos: DER SPIEGEL (4)\n\nA contact person is also included in the file, complete with a telephone\nnumber: Evgeniya Kurochkina. She is thought to provide assistance to the\nRussian domestic intelligence agency FSB. According to leaked information from\nRussia, Kurochkina has regularly telephoned and traveled with a Moscow-based\nagent of the authority.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the only moment in the course of this story that feels like\nyou\u2019ve suddenly landed in a spy novel by John le Carr\u00e9.\n\n### MARSALEK, THE GAMBLER\n\nMarsalek established his first ties to Russia in 2010. Shortly before that, he\nhad become a member of the executive board of the financial services provider\nWirecard, a company that was largely unknown at the time. Wirecard\u2019s main line\nof business was taking care of the technical processing of credit card\npayments for online vendors. Early on, that consisted primarily of porno and\ngambling sites. But the head of the company, Markus Braun, was looking for\nmore. A native of Vienna, Braun saw himself as an intellectual visionary and\nwas fond of wearing black turtle-neck sweaters like Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs. And\nhe, too, wanted to lead a global company.\n\nMarsalek, who is also Austrian, was Braun\u2019s right-hand man. He had started\nworking for Wirecard \u2013 called Wire Card at the time \u2013 when he was 20 as\n\"Director Technology\" for a starting monthly salary of 9,000 deutsche marks \u2013\nnot bad for someone who had just dropped out of school. But Marsalek was good\nat programming and understood the new network technology. That was enough to\nimpress the founder of Wirecard.\n\nBraun and Marsalek would prove to be a dream team, they were ambitious and\nbrash. Their goal was global expansion, envisioning telecom companies,\nairlines and retailers all taking care of their digital payments through\nWirecard. The company\u2019s stock price climbed continuously, even if its revenues\nand profits didn\u2019t keep pace early on. In February 2010, Marsalek was promoted\nto chief operating officer.\n\nThe two were also interested penetrating the Russian market, and their door\nopener was Florian Stermann, the enigmatic and somewhat shady president of the\nAustrian-Russian Friendship Society. With his assistance, Wirecard began\nnegotiating with the Russian telecommunications company Megafon in 2011.\nWirecard was hired to provide prepaid credit cards for mobile phone customers,\nbut the project failed. The company got a second chance to secure a\nsignificant deal in Russia though \u2013 by processing transactions for the Moscow\nsubway, with its 7 million passengers per day.\n\nIt was up to Marsalek to usher the deal to completion, and he began making\nfrequent trips to Russia. It was a life he quickly took to \u2013 the world of the\ninternational executive, complete with luxury hotels and gourmet restaurants.\nIt was a validation for him, a school dropout with no advanced degree who had\nalways wanted to prove everyone wrong and leave all those behind who just\nseemed to get in his way. Including his mother.\n\nMarsalek was born in Vienna on March 15, 1980, and grew up just a few\nkilometers away in the town of Klosterneuburg. He went to a French private\nschool before attending the local high school. He was a good student, quite\ntalented. \"Eloquent,\" with a \"great aptitude for computer sciences,\" say\nformer teachers.\n\nBut he was also a child who always had a hard time with rules and conventions,\nas his mother told DER SPIEGEL with a shake of her head just a few weeks after\nMarsalek\u2019s disappearance. The interview took place in July 2020 in an old\nfarmhouse not far from Vienna. She reverted to her birth name years ago and\nasked that it not be used in print. She said she hadn\u2019t been in touch with her\nson for quite some time. She calls him a \"arrogant showoff.\"\n\nA few old photos from his childhood still exist. One of them shows him wearing\na gray coat and a floppy hat that is far too big for him, looking like the\nclich\u00e9 of a secret agent. His father was hardly ever at home during the week\ndue to his job as the managing director of a company in the Czech Republic.\nBack home, says his mother, arguments were frequent.\n\nChildhood photos of Jan Marsalek\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Fotos: DER SPIEGEL (2)\n\nIn June 1999, she says, her son suddenly moved out after a fight. For a long\ntime, the only indications that he was alive came in the form of mobile phone\nbills and past-due notices, she recalls. She kept track of his career through\nthe media. \"I was always suspicious of Wirecard. The fact that Jan rose so\nquickly in the company without a diploma, how is that possible?\"\n\n\"Charisma,\" is the response given by almost all former Wirecard employees when\nasked that question. Former teachers, past lovers and former friends agree.\nEven as a 20-year-old, Marsalek exuded self-confidence and intelligence. \"You\nimmediately see him as a successful person who knows what he is talking about\nand what he is doing,\" says Pav Gill, the former chief legal officer for\nWirecard in Asia. \"A genius salesman who attracts people,\" says a former\nconfidant. \"He is eloquent, charming and extremely intelligent,\" says J\u00f6rn\nLeogrande, the former head of innovation for Wirecard.\n\nIt was an impression reinforced by Marsalek\u2019s lifestyle, which included\nparties in Saint Tropez and 15,000-euro dinners in the Mandarin Oriental in\nMunich, including several 2,500-euro bottles of champagne and Remy Martin\nLouis XIII cognac to wash it down.\n\nMarsalek's girlfriend Zlobina\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Foto: DER SPIEGEL\n\nBut he was also erratic. Before long, the deal with the Moscow metro ran into\ndifficulties and Marsalek seemed to lose interest in Russia. It was at this\nmoment that Natalya Zlobina made her appearance. The dubious Russian\nbusinessman Sergey Lee, say people who were present at the time, recommended\nher with the warmest of words. Zlobina, he told Marsalek, citing her excellent\ncontacts in the Moscow administration, could save the metro deal.\n\nSurprisingly good contacts for a 29-year-old who had, to that point, primarily\nmade a name for herself as an online erotic model. In the horror sex film \"Red\nLips 2 \u2013 Blood Lust,\" she plays a Russian secret agent who kills her victims\nwith a neurotoxin. Being an agent was apparently a role she was comfortable\nwith \u2013 also, it seems, in real life.\n\nOne clue is the fact that her personal information is closely protected.\nAccess to her passport file in an official database was temporarily blocked,\nwith officials instead providing information for a completely different woman.\nSomeone also deleted Zlobina\u2019s travel data from a police system. Such security\nmeasures are frequently used by Russian secret service agencies to protect\ntheir operatives.\n\nZlobina was also likely acting as a \"honey trap\" for Marsalek, a term used in\nthe agency world for attracting a target with a romantic liaison.\n\nThe subway deal between Moscow and Wirecard never actually materialized, but\nthe relationship between Marsalek and Zlobina quickly deepened beyond mere\nprofessional interests. They took quick trips together to places like\nBarcelona and Santorini, with Marsalek picking up his new girlfriend in Moscow\nwith a private jet. These and dozens of other trips can be retraced with the\nhelp of confidential flight and border-crossing databases, internal emails,\nchats and reports from acquaintances.\n\nZlobina, vacation photos from Jan Marsalek\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Fotos: DER SPIEGEL (3)\n\nThe two of them were looking for adventure, sources close to them say when\ndescribing their relationship. Marsalek apparently called her \"Zebra,\" and she\nallegedly had an animal nickname for him as well.\n\nIn September 2013, the couple took a trip to the Chechnyan capital of Grozny,\napparently to meet relatives of the dictator Ramzan Kadyrov, according to\nwitnesses. Kadyrov\u2019s clan, the witnesses say, had parked around $100 million\nin accounts in Hong Kong and were looking for a way to get the money to\nWestern Europe, laundered.\n\nZlobina allegedly introduced Marsalek as the one who could solve the problem.\nWirecard was taking care of large financial transactions every day. Perhaps\nnobody would notice a few extra million?\n\nWitness accounts in combination with trips taken by both Zlobina and by a\nKadyrov confidant show that people involved met later on two occasions, once\nin Vienna and once in Asia. Whether a deal ever actually took shape is\nunclear. But Marsalek apparently proved his worth in one way or the other.\n\nA couple of months later, in summer 2014, on that warm July evening in the\nPort of Nice, it was time for the next, decisive step. A special guest was in\nattendance for Zlobina\u2019s birthday party. According to the recollections of\nother guests at the party, she introduced him to Marsalek as \"Stas,\" saying he\nwas a \"general.\"\n\nHis complete name is Stanislav Petlinsky, a figure from the shady world of the\nRussian security apparatus who is as illustrious as he is indistinct. In the\n1990s, he worked for the Russian special forces unit Spetsnaz and was later\npart of the Presidential Administration of Russia in the Kremlin, according to\npeople close to him. After that, his rank and his role become less clear.\nWestern agents believe Petlinsky works for several Russian secret service\nagencies.\n\nMarsalek, in any case, was smitten from the very beginning, say those who\nwitnessed the early days of their friendship. Others say you can see Marsalek\nfrom two perspectives: Marsalek before Stas, and Marsalek after Stas.\n\nMarsalek wined and dined his friend Stanislav Petlinsky for the latter's\nbirthday at the high-end Munich restaurant Tantris.\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Foto: DER SPIEGEL\n\nMarsalek had an interest in weapons? Stas offered to arrange a shooting\ntraining session for him. Yan had questions about the underground world of\nRussian secret service agencies? Stas seemed to have all the answers.\n\nPetlinsky would later tell some that he handed Marsalek off to the GRU after\ntheir first meeting. That would mean that starting in summer 2014, Marsalek\nwas a tool of Russian secret service agencies, a view shared by Western\nintelligence officials.\n\nZlobina knew that Marsalek was an adrenalin junky, and they took a flight\ntogether in a fighter jet. One photo shows Marsalek sitting in a MiG-29\nwearing a pilot\u2019s helmet and oxygen mask, giving the thumbs up. A \"Top Gun\"\nfever dream.\n\nZlobina and Marsalek in a MiG fighter jet\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Fotos: DER SPIEGEL (3)\n\nPetlinsky guided Marsalek into the world of the Russian secret service.\nCompanions say that Marsalek even presented himself as an agent during this\nperiod. Others recall his interest over the years in the art of disappearing\nwithout a trace, in fake identities and escape routes. \"It was a constant\ntopic, almost an obsession,\" says one person close to Marsalek.\n\nPetlinsky also introduced Marsalek to a brawny man who occasionally wore a\nHells Angels sweatshirt. He called him \"Vladimir, my mercenary.\" In Moscow, he\nwas known as \"Biker,\" likely because of his predilection for rocker gang gear.\nHis real name is Anatoly Karazy. He is thought to have served as an officer\nwith the GRU special forces together with Petlinsky in Chechnya. After leaving\nthe military, Karazy joined the notorious mercenary army Wagner Group, a\nparamilitary organization so powerful that it has its own secret service \u2013 of\nwhich Karazy had taken over leadership by 2017, at the latest.\n\nOn May 5, 2017, the Wagner secret service chief Karazy flew from Moscow to\nMunich for a meeting with Marsalek. The two traveled onward together in a\nprivate jet to Beirut, where they met Petlinsky. From there, the trip took\nthem across the mountains to the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra, where the\nRussian army, Wagner mercenaries and troops from Syrian dictator Bashar\nAssad\u2019s military were fighting against Islamic State and against insurgents.\nAt around this time, Wagner members were involved in torturing civilians to\ndeath in the area.\n\nMarsalek and his two Russian companions stayed for several days. Photos show\nthe Wirecard executive wearing aviator sunglasses, a bulletproof vest and a\ncombat helmet. In one photo, a rapid-fire rifle can be seen. In another, the\nancient Roman theater of Palmyra.\n\nMarsalek and Petlinsky in Syria, Petlinsky with rocket-propelled grenade\nlauncher\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Fotos: DER SPIEGEL (2)\n\nSome say that Marsalek fired at Islamist fighters. Anatoly Karazy did not\nrespond to a request for comment about his past and about Marsalek.\n\nWas the trip to Syria just another example of Marsalek\u2019s addiction to\nadrenaline? Or were the Russians, was Petlinsky, interested in getting\nMarsalek to do things for which he could later be blackmailed?\n\nDER SPIEGEL received a tip: Those interested in finding Stanislav Petlinsky\nwould be advised to have a look in Dubai, on the terrace of the hotel\nrestaurant Al Mandhar at the five-star beach resort Jumeirah al-Naseem. Guests\nthere are served champagne and beluga caviar among the palms and pools. In the\nbackground is the shimmering Persian Gulf and the Dubai trademark Burj Al\nArab. This, apparently, is where Petlinsky likes to meet his business\ncontacts.\n\nOn a Friday in mid-February, the terrace is full of young Russian women\ndressed in luxury labels and accompanied by muscular men wearing olive green\nT-shirts. The oligarch Alexander Lebedev, a former secret service officer, can\nbe seen sitting in one of the pavilions next to his wife, a model and\ninfluencer with 2.7 million followers on Instagram. The news is just spreading\non the internet that the Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has died\nin prison.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long before Petlinsky actually does appear on the terrace. In\nhis early 60s, he is wiry and muscular, a physique clearly visible from his\nfitted, light-gray pinstriped suit and tight black T-shirt. On his left wrist,\nhe is wearing a silver Rolex, his eyes are hidden behind mirrored aviator\nsunglasses, and his hair is shorn close. He nods to the oligarch Lebedev, who\nnods back.\n\nYes, he says, he met Marsalek back on that yacht in the South of France. \"You\nknow what? I was in love with him from the very first moment,\" Petlinsky says\nwith a laugh.\n\nWhy?\n\n\"He has such a wonderful spirit,\" Petlinsky says. \"I always think so small, in\nterms of what\u2019s possible. Jan always thinks big \u2013 really, really big.\"\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nPetlinsky says that the office of German chancellor would probably be too\nmeaningless for his friend. A big project like leading Europe, China and\nRussia together as a counterbalance to the United States, he says \u2013 that\u2019s the\nkind of thing that would interest Jan.\n\nSo he\u2019s a star-gazer?\n\nPetlinsky doesn\u2019t want to say anything bad about his friend Jan. \"Jan always\nhad himself under control.\" He wanted his brain to be working at maximum\ncapacity. \"Jan wasn\u2019t addicted to anything,\" says Petlinsky, \"except perhaps\nto power.\"\n\nMarsalek is \"a nerd,\" always \"super precise, a bit autistic really.\" And then\nPetlinsky, who has excellent contacts with mercenary leaders, says: \"Human\nrelationships are not Jan\u2019s biggest strength. He lacks empathy.\"\n\nThe skyline of Dubai, Marsalek in a Learjet\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Fotos: DER SPIEGEL; Kamran Jebreili / AP\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to tell that this conversation is lasting longer than he\nwants. A couple of tables away, a man in mirrored glasses and golfing shorts\nis waiting. A young woman comes by looking for attention. \"Moscow people,\"\nsays Petlinsky.\n\nDoes Marsalek work for Russian intelligence services?\n\nNo, but he is \"obsessed with the world of espionage,\" says Petlinsky.\n\nDid Petlinsky introduce him to a lot of people in Russia?\n\nYes, including \"high-ranking decision-makers,\" some of them members of the\nDuma, Russia\u2019s parliament.\n\nIncluding agents?\n\nPetlinsky changes the subject. He is apparently well-versed in laying false\ntrails and interweaving truth with fiction.\n\nIs Petlinsky himself currently with the GRU, and in what rank?\n\nThere is no evidence for this, he responds. Petlinsky claims to be a \"security\nconsultant,\" only to later talk about personal encounters with President\nVladimir Putin. And about how he once tracked a corrupt FSB officer around the\nworld, catching up to him in Montenegro. He complains about how unprofessional\nthe Berlin Tiergarten park murder was, referring to the 2019 murder of a\nGeorgian enemy in the German capital committed by an FSB killer who was then\ncaptured. Petlinsky makes clear that he would have liked to kill the murder\nvictim himself \u2013 and would have then spit on the body.\n\nTattooed, militaristic-looking men show up on the terrace, some of whom drop\nby for a chat. He shakes hands with some. A \"hero,\" he says on one occasion,\nindicating a brawny mercenary who, says Petlinsky, has 3,000 men under his\ncommand in Ukraine. Petlinsky seems to know almost everybody here. The hotel\nterrace in Dubai appears to be something of a hub for Russian mercenaries,\nbusinesspeople and much, much younger women.\n\n\"What was it like in Syria?\"\n\nHe apparently finds the subject unobjectionable and freely confirms it. The\ntrip with the Wagner commander, he says, had been a dream of Jan\u2019s that he was\nable to fulfil.\n\nAnd what about Marsalek\u2019s boasts that he had been allowed to shoot at\nIslamists?\n\nPetlinsky smiles. Jan, he says, had likely imagined flying in a helicopter\nwith the side door open, loud music and Ray-Ban sunglasses. He says he quickly\ntook a hand grenade away from Jan.\n\nAnd what about firing at people. What weapons did he use?\n\nPetlinsky is silent for a moment. Then he uses the abbreviation RPG, rocket-\npropelled grenade. It had been \"cool for Jan,\" he says, when someone\ninstructed him on the correct way to position his legs when shooting from a\nlying position. \"We may have also told him roughly in which direction the\nfront was.\" Later, Petlinsky will write in a message to DER SPIEGEL that\nfirearms training was \"a standard part of preparing to travel to crisis\nareas.\"\n\nPetlinsky now wants to bring our conversation to an end, perhaps because it\nwas taking an uncomfortable turn: After Marsalek disappeared, an employee of\nPetlinsky\u2019s arranged a Russian passport for him \u2013 after which he and Jan\napparently spent time together traveling in Russia.\n\n\"Who told you that?\" Petlinsky wants to know. \"I have great respect for your\nwork, but you might also make mistakes.\"\n\nWhat about the spy ring that Marsalek had apparently established, and the\nallegedly planned kidnappings and assassinations that Western agencies were\nable to foil.\n\nThat was alarming, says Petlinsky. But murders were certainly never part of\nthe plan, that was falsely interpreted. Petlinsky smiles.\n\nYou can insist over and over again that he is clearly lying, that there is\nevidence for certain things. But Petlinsky just draws down the corners of his\nmouth and shrugs. He has to go, and politely declines when asked about being\nphotographed. Sorry guys.\n\n### MARSALEK\u2019S TWO LIVES\n\nMany of those who encountered Marsalek in Munich in summer 2017 shortly after\nhis return from Syria describe him as having been \"completely exhilarated.\" At\nWirecard headquarters on the outskirts of Munich, meanwhile, the mood was\njubilant. The company was expanding rapidly \u2013 to Africa, Australia, Asia and\nNorth America. The hype was immense. After a wait of several decades, Germany\nhad finally produced another global player, a company that appeared to be in\nthe big leagues \u2013 at a time when German banks, even years after the financial\ncrisis, still hadn\u2019t returned to health. Commerzbank was almost broke and\nDeutsche Bank was but a shadow of its former self.\n\nAt Wirecard, though, it seemed that the future of banking was taking shape,\nwith software solutions for the kind of payment transactions that made online\nshopping possible in the first place. According to company records, Wirecard\nwas processing payments for 279,000 clients per year, including the\nsupermarket chain Aldi and travel company TUI.\n\nBut rumors were swirling. People were saying that Wirecard was inventing\nprofits and cooking the books, that the company was sleazy. Money laundering\nwas mentioned.\n\nIn 2015, Munich prosecutors searched Wirecard offices on behalf of U.S.\nauthorities. Additional investigations took place in the U.S. It remained\nunclear what they found.\n\nBraun and Marsalek responded to the accusations with irritation. Everything\nwas just malicious attempts at stock price manipulation by hedge funds and\njournalists, they said. They had naysayers shadowed and threatened by private\ndetectives.\n\nIn 2018, Wirecard became part of the DAX, the German blue-chip index that\nincluded, at the time, the 30 most valuable and most important companies in\nthe country. With more than 270,000 customers, Wirecard processed 125 billion\neuros in transactions and generated 560 million euros in revenues that year.\nAt least according to the balance sheet. Later, it would be declared void.\nEither many of the declared sales didn\u2019t actually exist, which is what\nprosecutors believe. Or they were funneled by Marsalek through dark channels,\nas claimed by Braun, who has been in investigative custody for three years and\ndenies all of the accusations leveled against him. At the time, though, nobody\nsaw what was going on. In fact, Braun and Marsalek were even planning a\ntakeover of Deutsche Bank, an operation they had codenamed \"Panther.\"\n\nMarsalek\u2019s main job was to make Wirecard even bigger, and to do so as rapidly\nas possible. Increasingly, though, he became something of a phantom at\nWirecard headquarters, largely invisible even for senior managers. \"Nobody\nreally knew what he did,\" says a colleague. For several years toward the end,\nMarsalek only rarely stepped into his 110-square-meter (1,180-square-foot)\noffice on company premises on the outskirts of Munich.\n\nInstead, he built up his own center of operations around 10 kilometers away in\nthe center of Munich. It was here where his two lives \u2013 the official and the\nsecret \u2013 would merge.\n\nThe four-story, art nouveau villa at Prinzregentenstrasse 61 is one of the\nmost exclusive addresses in the Bavarian capital, a property of more than\n1,600 square meters filled with Italian furniture, bronze sculptures and\npaintings of historic battles. Acquired in 1903 by Prince Alfons of Bavaria as\na prestigious aristocratic residence, it was later inhabited by Conrad\nR\u00f6ntgen, the discoverer of x-rays. Starting in 2016, the villa served the\nWirecard executive as a hub for his secret operations. At least some of the\n680,000 euros in annual rent was covered through back channels by Wirecard. At\nthe time, the Russian consulate was located on the other side of the street.\n\nMarsalek's headquarters on Prinzregentenstrasse in Munich, photos from his\noffice there\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Fotos: DER SPIEGEL (2); Robert Haas / picture\nalliance / SZ Photo\n\nMarsalek set up his office on the first floor, receiving his visitors in an\nelegantly furnished meeting room. Leaning against a wall of the office was the\nframed Austrian declaration of war against Sardinia from 1859. The room was\nfrequented by politicians, bankers and agents. The visitors included a former\nLibyan intelligence chief, a former senior domestic security official from\nAustria \u2013 and, on one occasion, a former chief of staff from Helmut Kohl\u2019s\nChancellery, Bernd Schmidbauer. And Petlinsky, of course, often.\n\n\"People were coming in and out all the time,\" says a woman who worked closely\nwith Marsalek for many years. She was already at his side when he first made\nit onto the Wirecard board of executives in 2010. For this story, we have\nchosen to refer to her as Johanna Singer; she requested anonymity as a\ncondition for being interviewed for this story.\n\nShe also got to know Petlinsky in the Prinzregentenstrasse villa. \"I thought\nhe was really nice,\" she says, adding that he talked about his grandchildren.\nSinger arranged a birthday party for him in the gourmet restaurant Tantris in\nMunich. A photo shows him laughing at a table together with Marsalek, a star-\nshaped birthday cake between them.\n\nSinger says she only learned later from state prosecutors about the many other\nshady characters who frequented the villa. Did she really think things were\ncompletely normal? That Marsalek equipped the villa with medical supplies,\nhospital beds and gas masks? That he invited a security expert in from Israel\nto inspect the place for surveillance devices? \"As I now know today, Jan had a\nnumber of different personalities.\"\n\nShe paints the picture of an erratic man who liked to live life on the edge, a\nman who, after leaving work, would go to the cinema in tailor-made Brioni\nsuits to watch spy films. An adrenaline junky with a tendency for hypochondria\nfor whom she would quickly fly over to London just to buy his favorite cough\nsyrup.\n\nSome investigators raise their eyebrows when Johanna Singer is mentioned. She\nhas been questioned several times \u2013 as a witness, not as a suspect,\ninvestigators emphasize. But it is also just as true, they say, that Singer is\nlikely holding back information. She has been too close to Marsalek for too\nlong, they say.\n\nIt is hard to believe, for example, that in all these years she never noticed\nwho had turned into of the most important regulars in Prinzregentenstrasse.\nFor Singer, he is just \"a former civil servant from Austria\" who is now\n\"working as a consultant in the private sector.\" But Martin Weiss wasn't just\nany civil servant. For years, he had headed Department II at the Austrian\nFederal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism\n(BVT), the Austrian domestic intelligence service. There, he had been\nresponsible for gathering information, conducting investigations and analyzing\nintelligence. A top agent in charge of the core operational business of the\nintelligence service. All intelligence information collected by the BVT ended\nup in the department he oversaw. That includes all information sent to Vienna\nby partner services such as the CIA, the German Office for the Protection of\nthe Constitution or Israel's Mossad.\n\nAfter Weiss officially left the Office for the Protection of the Constitution,\nMarsalek hired him as a \"consultant.\" But the two had probably known each\nother since at least 2015. It appears that Marsalek needed Weiss mainly as a\nhenchman for dirty agent work and not really for Wirecard business.\n\nFor example, to investigate people of interest to Marsalek and the Kremlin in\nparticular. It was an easy game for Weiss, with his network in Western\nintelligence services. Weiss had searches conducted of more than two dozen\npeople in internal databases to find out what the authorities knew about them.\nThey included Marsalek's own family and Petlinsky, as well as journalists\nliving in Europe and a Kazakh opposition activist.\n\nWeiss would later admit some of it following his arrest in interrogations with\nthe special investigation unit of the Austrian Interior Ministry.\n\nAccording to documents from the investigation, it was \"conspicuous\" that\npeople, \"apparently in the interests of the Russian Federation,\" were\ninvestigated with particular frequency. Also striking was the fact that it\ntook quite some time before the Austrian intelligence service took notice of\nMarsalek. A Viennese special investigation unit called AG Fama, which was\ninvestigating possible Russian moles in the BVT, only came across him after\nMarsalek's escape. Today, the investigation file comprises thousands of pages.\nThe investigation came to the conclusion that Weiss and Marsalek were part of\nan \"intelligence cell whose capacities and capabilities were used by Russian\nintelligence services.\"\n\n### IN THE KREMLIN'S SIGHTS\n\nMarsalek's activities could have been discovered earlier, in part because yet\nanother agent also belonged to the cell: A brawny, cagey veteran of the BVT\nwith the mellifluous name Egisto Ott, a controversial figure in the Austrian\nintelligence scene for some time. As early as 2017, foreign intelligence\nservices \u2013 presumably the American CIA and the British MI6 \u2013 had sounded the\nalarm. Ott, they said, had repeatedly sent data from his official e-mail\naddress at BVT to his private account. The foreign intelligence services\npresumed that he was spying for the Russians. His superior at BVT at the time\nwas Martin Weiss.\n\nOtt was suspended, but his network continued to function. He used it to gather\nsensitive information on target persons for Weiss and Marsalek. To that end,\nhe apparently employed informants at home and abroad to make inquiries for him\non official service computers. Weiss allegedly paid Ott thousands of euros for\nhis work, as investigators would later determine. Ott has denied the\nallegations.\n\nDespite the severity of the accusations, he was released after a short period\nin custody. It takes a bit of looking around in Austria these days if you want\nto talk to him. Neighbors haven't seen him at his apartment in Vienna for some\ntime. But in Ott's home region of Carinthia, in a valley near W\u00f6rthersee lake,\na beautiful estate lies shimmering in the winter sun.\n\nA few hours later, Mr. and Mrs. Ott emerge to walk their dog. Ott, a stocky\nman with a green quilted jacket and a firm handshake, agrees to a walk with\nthe DER SPIEGEL reporter.\n\n\"You can tell that I'm a Russian spy just by the fact that I still have my old\nmobile phone number,\" he jokes. He says the accusations are baseless, a vast\nconspiracy by influential opponents in politics and the intelligence service \u2013\nbecause he knew too much. In long monologues, Ott tells outlandish stories\nabout ransom money that allegedly disappeared during hostage rescues and ended\nup in the pockets of his enemies. \"I never took part in breaking the rules,\nbut always did an excellent job,\" says Ott. He claims they just wanted to shut\nhim down.\n\nMountains of investigation files on Ott's activities cast a few doubts on his\naccount. How the flow of information appears to have worked, through various\nchannels and connections, is demonstrated by the screenshot of a chat that Ott\nsaved on his iPhone 8 on September 10, 2019. In the message, Petlinsky turns\nto his friend Marsalek with a problem. The mistress of Russian billionaire\nArkady Rotenberg and her sister were constantly having trouble when crossing\nborders into Europe. Marsalek, at the time still a Wirecard board member,\nforwarded the message to his helper Martin Weiss and asked \"whether we could\nprovide support in the matter.\" Petlinsky confirmed the instance, but said\nthat the request had just been a favor for the two women.\n\nIt fell to Ott to actually take care of the task. As further text messages\nsuggest, Ott apparently asked a police colleague in Italy for discreet help.\nThe Italian returned two weeks later after uncovering some information. The\nwomen, he found, had an entry in the European border search system SIS that\nhad been issued by Latvia for undercover checks on the grounds of \"terrorism.\"\nIn this manner, sensitive data found its way to Petlinsky and thus to Moscow.\n\nA question to Ott during the walk: How could this assignment have had a work-\nrelated purpose? His answer: \"I didn't make an inquiry with us. This is\nverifiable: There is nothing.\"\n\nThe probes carried out by Ott and Weiss could sometimes be extremely\nthreatening for those affected, as shown by the case of a journalist who was\nspied on. Christo Grozev has spent many years investigating the machinations\nof Russian intelligence services. Grozev was head of the renowned research\nplatform Bellingcat and now works for DER SPIEGEL. He contributed to this\narticle.\n\nGrozev's investigative reporting has revealed the most terrible secrets of the\nRussian state, uncovering the intelligence ties of the killer of Georgian\nnational Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in Berlin's Tiergarten park in August 2019.\nReports from Bellingcat about the secret service men who poisoned the now\ndeceased politician Alexei Navalny in 2020 caused a global sensation. Jan\nMarsalek was also the focus of Grozev's attention on several occasions: One\nDER SPIEGEL article traced his escape route to Minsk in Belarus and revealed\nfor the first time dozens of trips to Russia made by the former executive in\nprevious years.\n\nAccordingly, Grozev has long held a high position on the Kremlin's wanted\nlist. Early last year, Western security authorities gave the journalist, who\nwas living in Vienna at the time, a sudden warning that he should leave\nAustria as soon as possible. He says he was told that they had concrete\nknowledge of attack plans by Russian services. Grozev relocated.\n\nAround two years earlier, on December 15, 2020, Weiss had sent an encrypted\nmessage to Ott. It read: \"Could we make a query in Austria about a Mr. Christo\nGrozev?\" In a later message, Weiss wrote to Ott: Grozev is supporting an\noperation \"against the cause.\" Ott then provided the address of Grozev's\nprivate apartment.\n\nOtt confirms the interaction during our walk with him in Carinthia. \"All I did\nwas go to the Registration Office and pay 3.40 euros to find out where he\nlives.\" He says he also may have taken a few photos of Grozev's building.\nThat's not illegal, he adds. Why was Weiss so keen to know where Grozev lived?\nDid the assignment come from Marsalek? Ott claims he never gave it any\nthought. He denies that he may have helped Putin's spies locate an enemy. \"I\nalways fought the Russian intelligence service throughout my career,\" he says.\n\nIn any case, he says, the investigations into his activities were sloppy and\nnot conducted in accordance with the rule of law. This is one reason why he\nwas released from custody, he says. And it is true that despite years of\ninvestigation, the Public Prosecutor's Office has yet to bring charges, as is\nalso the case in the investigation into Weiss. This has prompted suspicions\namong high-ranking officials that someone in Vienna is stepping on the brakes.\nIs the influence of Marsalek's network in Austria still so strong that\ninvestigations into suspected collaborators are fizzling out?\n\nIn the meantime, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution has been\nreformed, renamed and most of its personnel replaced. But there isn't enough\nevidence against some agents who were considered close to Marsalek and Weiss\nto remove them from office, one intelligence officer complains. The danger is\nreal that Marsalek is still spying on Austrian authorities, politicians and\ncompanies on behalf of Russian services, the intelligence officer says.\n\n### WIRECARD, A RUSSIAN ENTITY?\n\nWhy was Moscow interested in recruiting Marsalek in the first place? There is\nmuch to suggest that it was his position as Wirecard's chief operating officer\nthat sparked Moscow's interest.\n\nAn agent in a company that is involved in global payment transactions: how\npractical.\n\nAll kinds of sensitive information wound up at Wirecard headquarters, all the\nmore so once the company joined the DAX index of blue-chip German companies.\nDozens of international companies processed some of their financial\ntransactions through Wirecard. Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office was\nalso a customer and regularly used the company's payment technology. At one\npoint, Marsalek instructed subordinates to compile a year's worth of customer\ndata \u2013 allegedly, as he said, for the BND, Germany's foreign intelligence\nagency. It would later turn out that the BND had never actually requested the\ndata. Instead, it's possible that the confidential information wound up in\nMoscow.\n\nAlso extremely useful was the fact that Wirecard organized its business in\nAsia through so-called third-party partners. Billions in transactions for\ncustomers were processed outside of Wirecard, but the revenues were credited\nto the company and the supposed commission income was booked to escrow\naccounts. Even for the auditors, the cash flows were extremely difficult to\nunderstand. Hardly surprising then that it took quite some time before it was\ndiscovered that billions of euros in Wirecard funds were not in the accounts\nwhere they were purported to be held. The whole structure seemed like it had\nbeen designed for money laundering.\n\nSome in intelligence circles even allege that Marsalek helped to pay agents\nand informants of the Russian GRU through Wirecard, a claim that has thus far\nnot been verified.\n\nSeveral sources did, however, confirm that Marsalek likely used Wirecard funds\nto buy his own mercenary company through proxies, to be deployed in crisis\nzones.\n\nApparently, Marsalek wanted to make himself more and more useful to his\nRussian friends. What could he do? According to people close to him, Petlinsky\nhad a few ideas, and pointed out that war-torn Libya needs to be rebuilt.\nRussia has a great interest in the North African country, which is rich in oil\nand gas reserves \u2013 and is also in a position to manage refugee flows to\nEurope. Petlinsky is said to have suggested getting involved in the business\nof cement, which would ultimately be needed for reconstruction. The sources\nclaim that Marsalek promptly invested in cement factories.\n\nThe people close to Petlinsky also say he made Marsalek aware of an\nexperienced Russian company operating in the gray area between mercenary\noperations and security service called the RSB Group. The company, Petlinsky\nallegedly told Marsalek, had experience in counter-terrorism missions,\nproviding protection against pirate attacks and, most importantly, a license\nfor mine clearing. Marsalek was impressed, but he didn't just hire the outfit\nfor a mission in Libya, he apparently immediately bought the entire company.\nMarsalek now apparently owned his own mercenary company through a murky\nconstruct. Petlinsky denies having advised Marsalek to make the investments.\n\nAn RSB mercenary in Libya, the logo of the Wagner Group\n\n[M] Lea Rossa / DER SPIEGEL; Foto: DER SPIEGEL\n\nAnd Marsalek had even bigger plans. On June 28, 2017, he described them to\ncrisis expert Kilian Kleinschmidt, who had worked for the United Nations for\nmany years, at K\u00e4fer-Sch\u00e4nke, an upscale restaurant in Munich.\n\nKleinschmidt was commissioned with completing a study for Marsalek, for\n200,000 euros, on how Libya could be rebuilt. The invoice, as Kleinschmidt\nnotes today, was to be sent to the \"Russian-Libyan Cultural Institute\" in\nMoscow. Initially, he says he thought the goal was to make Libya a better\nplace for people to live.\n\nBut at a second meeting, this time at the villa on Prinzregentenstrasse,\nMarsalek dismissed the first proposals from Kleinschmidt's team as \"childish\"\nand revealed his real idea: a military \"conversion program\" that would train\n15,000 to 20,000 Libyan militiamen. According to this idea, the private army\nwas to control Libya's southern border and thus the migration flows.\n\nKleinschmidt wanted nothing to do with it and was disconcerted. Also because\nduring a coffee break Marsalek had raved about the new equipment that\nmercenaries were wearing in the field. And of \"cool bodycams\" that produced\nvideos in top quality. Behind it all was a gruesome idea that Marsalek also\npresented to Petlinsky: Wagner mercenaries could use these cameras attached to\ntheir uniforms to broadcast their fight against the Islamists on the Internet.\nThey could livestream their murder and pillaging. Viewers who liked what they\nsaw should be given the opportunity to donate to the militia in return. The\nonly problem, Marsalek reportedly said, is that the existing Wagner videos\n\"cannot be used as advertising because the boys shoot all their prisoners.\"\n\nKleinschmidt wanted nothing more to do with the project, and the two sides\nended their collaboration. Of the 200,000 euros that had been promised,\nKleinschmidt ultimately only received 80,000 euros.\n\nAnd the German security authorities? Why hadn't they sent a swarm of agents\nafter Marsalek by that point? From their perspective, they say in Berlin,\nMarsalek was just a businessman. They simply had no reason to suspect that he\nwas working for Russian intelligence services. In any case, they could hardly\nstart monitoring board members of DAX companies who were flying to Moscow,\nthey claim, saying it really wasn't their job.\n\nAn official statement from the Chancellery offers a similar tone. There were\n\"no indications\" that \"would have justified the intelligence services to take\naction,\" it reads.\n\nPart of the problem is that the counterintelligence department inside the\nOffice for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's domestic intelligence\nagency, is small. Meanwhile, the BND is only now starting to rebuild its\ncounter-intelligence operations. Since the end of the Cold War, German\nsecurity authorities have been focused on terrorists, not spies. Some Berlin\nagents also complain that they are now being so strictly controlled and\nregulated that they are barely able to do their work.\n\nThe officers concentrate on monitoring registered agents in embassies,\nalthough Marsalek probably never even had anything to do with them. He met his\nintelligence service contacts in Moscow, on the C\u00f4te d'Azur or in Tripoli, far\naway from German observers.\n\nFurthermore, many politicians were vying for the attention of executives at\nWirecard. That also likely contributed to a broader unwillingness to take a\ncloser look at the company. On the contrary.\n\nWhen Wirecard entered the Chinese market for digital payment processing in\n2019, the consulting firm of former German Economics and Defense Minister\nKarl-Theodor zu Guttenberg helped with support at the highest political\nlevels. Close advisors to Chancellor Angela Merkel were also involved. In\nSeptember 2019, when Merkel traveled to Beijing, she put in a good word for\nWirecard in China.\n\nThe German Finance Ministry, then led by current Chancellor Olaf Scholz, also\nlent a helping hand. And all this even as the allegations of fraud and money\nlaundering against Wirecard were growing louder.\n\nAccording to sources close the chancellor, Scholz never met with Wirecard\nexecutives during his time as finance minister. They say that Wirecard did not\nreceive any more international support from the German government than other\nGerman companies.\n\nThat could be true. At the same time, \"other German companies\" weren't\nsuspected of fraud.\n\n### MARSALEK'S NEW IDENTITY\n\nBarely nine months after Merkel's trip to China, Wirecard AG filed for\ninsolvency on June 25, 2020, because almost 2 billion euros had disappeared\nfrom escrow accounts. Or it never existed in the first place. Marsalek went\ninto hiding. The ID of one of Petlinsky's business partners was used to rent a\nprivate jet, and a contact of former agent Weiss organized two trustworthy\npilots. False tracks were then laid towards Asia, and Philippine immigration\nofficials were even bribed to fake Marsalek's entry.\n\nIn reality, Marsalek landed in Belarus on the night of June 20 and then\ncontinued by car toward Moscow, according to confidants of Marsalek who were\ninvolved in the escape plans. They claim his escape had been organized by a\npolitical functionary who is otherwise in charge of Russian-Libyan relations.\nIn addition to Russian citizenship, the man also holds a passport from\nBelarus. And he is, how could it be otherwise, a close acquaintance of\nPetlinsky.\n\nThen there was silence for several weeks. Marsalek had to wait for his new\nRussian identity, taking the name of the priest Konstantin Bayazov. On\nSeptember 5, the document was picked up, and the Petlinsky confidant and\nsuspected FSB aide Evgeniya Kurochkina rented a minibus and drove with\nMarsalek to Crimea. This can be seen by the location data of her mobile phone\nnumber, which was obtained by The Insider, and other evidence. Petlinsky was\nmost likely with them. Whether Natalya Zlobina joined them as well is unclear.\n\nOn the evening of September 8, Kurochkina's mobile phone was logged in\nSevastopol, Crimea. The peninsula annexed by Russia seems to be popular among\nthose who need to disappear quickly. Barely a year earlier, in August 2019,\nthe family of the man who killed the Georgian in Berlin's Tiergarten park was\nhidden here as well, accompanied by an FSB agent.\n\nNow, it was Marsalek and his friends who showed up. The next morning, on\nSeptember 9, the group ordered several taxis, according to leaked phone data,\nand scoured hotels on the southern coast of Crimea. Marsalek apparently\nchecked into one of the overnight accommodations. There, he presented his new\npassport for registration and an employee scanned it. DER SPIEGEL has seen the\ndocument. It is the passport of the priest Bayazov with Jan Marsalek's photo.\n\nThere are indications that Marsalek later assumed the identity of Alexander\nSchmidt in Moscow, and probably also that of a second Russian priest, Vitaly\nMalkin.\n\nThe group initially stayed in Crimea for a few days. Petlinsky chartered a\nprivate jet from Simferopol airport in Crimea back to Moscow on September 12,\naccording to booking data. But there was apparently a problem and he didn\u2019t\nboard the flight. Petlinsky ultimately returned to the Russian capital one day\nlater. And that's the point where the trail to Marsalek is lost.\n\nPetlinsky confirmed to DER SPIEGEL that he was in the area at the time and\nthat he flew back on a private jet. But he denied having helped Marsalek\nescape. When asked about the allegations, Evgeniya Kurochkina, the passport\ncourier, said that interactions between strangers should be \"beneficial for\nboth sides\" \u2013 in other words, she would only provide information for money.\nNatalya Zlobina left a request for comment about all the accusations\nunanswered. When asked about Marsalek over the phone, the priest Bayazov said\nthat he couldn't say anything about it. \"Why do you refuse to understand\nthat?\" Marsalek's defense attorney left an extensive list of questions\nunanswered.\n\nDid this also mark the end of Jan Marsalek's career as an agent? No. Marsalek\napparently continued looking for other ways to make himself useful to his\nRussian masters. Ways that were even more extreme. The trail leads to a\ncourtroom in Britain.\n\nIt's raining in London on this gray autumn day in October 2023 \u2013 what else\nmight you expect in a spy thriller? Inside: A wood-paneled hall, the judge in\na robe and wig is enthroned on an upholstered seat. \"My Lord,\" the barristers\nsay when addressing him. The benches, the chairs, the stairs: Everything\nsqueaks and creaks in the Old Bailey, Britain's most famous criminal court.\nThree men and two women follow the preliminary hearing via video link from\ndifferent prisons with grim expressions on their faces.\n\nThe accusations of the public prosecutor's office weigh as heavily as the air\nis thick in the hall. They claim that Jan Marsalek conspired with the\ndefendants between August 30, 2020, and February 8, 2023, to gather\ninformation that is directly or indirectly useful to an enemy and thus harmful\nto the interest and security of the state, according to a court document.\n\nBritish agents and criminal investigators claim that Marsalek commissioned the\ngang to spy on people disliked by the Kremlin, follow them across Europe \u2013 and\npresumably kidnap or even eliminate them in the end. London police arrested\nthe Bulgarian defendants in February 2023 on suspicion of espionage. The\ndomestic intelligence service MI5 had been monitoring them for some time.\n\nIn addition to the group's forged passports and masses of travel data, around\n80,000 chat messages serve as key evidence, the public prosecutor's office\nsays. According to the prosecutors, the spying was part of kidnapping or\nassassination plans by Russian agencies. The exact instructions for the\nBulgarians allegedly came via Telegram messages from Marsalek. They were\napparently paid by cryptocurrency and in cash through an intermediary.\n\nIt is not known exactly how the group came to the attention of\ncounterintelligence. But they apparently hit the right target. Investigators\nallegedly found electronic surveillance equipment and 19 forged documents,\nincluding press cards and clothing labeled \"Discovery Channel\" and \"National\nGeographic.\" Apparently, some of the suspects had posed as journalists during\ntheir clandestine operations.\n\nBusinessman Orlin Roussev, 46, a surveillance specialist, is believed to be\nthe ringleader of the group of agents. The British investigators likely\ntracked down Marsalek through Roussev, an old acquaintance of his from the\nWirecard days. As emails between him and Marsalek show, he seemingly provided\nthe executive with specially secured mobile phones several years ago. Roussev\nonce wrote to Marsalek that he knew a Chinese provider who was \"more than\ncapable\" of delivering \"customized solutions\" for smartphones and other\nelectronic devices.\n\nIn early February, the German authorities revealed just how seriously they now\ntake the danger posed by Marsalek. The key witness in the Wirecard trial,\nOliver Bellenhaus, was released from custody on conditional release after\naround three and a half years. The former Dubai representative of Wirecard\nheavily incriminated Braun and Marsalek in the trial.\n\nSince then, Bellenhaus has been escorted to and from the high-security Munich\ncourtroom two heavy vehicles. Because of articles published by DER SPIEGEL and\nother media on the agents allegedly led by Marsalek and operating out of\nLondon, the public prosecutor's office and the police consider it necessary to\nprovide Bellenhaus with a security detachment.\n\nThe trial in London against the Bulgarian spy ring is due to begin at the end\nof this year. Some of the targets are still in danger to this day because\nMoscow has them in its crosshairs.\n\nThe alleged principal and ringleader Jan Marsalek will most likely not be in\nthe dock. He remains missing, well hidden by his Russian protectors, largely\ninvisible.\n\nIt's a bit like the Loch Ness Monster: Allegedly spotted again and again, but\nnever caught. Some sources believe he is in Thailand, others say India. And\nthen digital tracks point to Caracas in Venezuela. The Kremlin has written to\nthe German judiciary suggesting that they ask around in Kazakhstan. And the\nWall Street Journal has reported that Marsalek is in Dubai.\n\nThat's also where Petlinsky happens to be.\n\nWhat does he say when asked where Marsalek can be found? \"I don't know, we\nlost contact because of the pandemic,\" Petlinsky said on a warm February day\nin the desert sun of Dubai.\n\nHe smiles. \"Probably somewhere nice.\"\n\nWith additional reporting by Kate Manchester\n\n### Mehr lesen \u00fcber\n\nGerman Economy Banking and Finance Crime Russia\n\nKostenlose Online-Spiele\n\nmehr Spiele\n\n  * Kreuzwortr\u00e4tsel\n  * Solit\u00e4r\n  * Sudoku\n  * Mahjong\n  * Bubble-Shooter\n  * Jackpot\n  * Snake\n  * Exchange\n  * 2048\n  * Doppel\n  * Rushtower\n  * Sudoken\n  * Street\n  * Wortblitz\n  * Fibonacci\n  * Gumblast\n  * Wimmelbild\n  * Skiracer\n  * Trivial Pursuit\n\nServiceangebote von SPIEGEL-Partnern\n\nGutscheine\n\nAnzeige\n\nOTTO Gutscheine\n\nTchibo Gutsheine\n\nBis zu 40% Rabatt\n\n15\u20ac Gutschein\n\nTop Gutscheine Alle Shops\n\n  * Bu\u00dfgeldrechner\n  * Firmenwagenrechner\n\n  * Brutto-Netto-Rechner\n  * Jobsuche\n  * Kurzarbeitergeld-Rechner\n  * Studienf\u00e4cher erkl\u00e4rt\n\n  * Gehaltsvergleich\n  * Versicherungen\n  * W\u00e4hrungsrechner\n  * Unternehmen\n\n  * B\u00fccher bestellen\n  * Eurojackpot\n  * Ferientermine\n\n  * Gl\u00fccksSpirale\n  * Gutscheine\n  * LOTTO 6aus49\n\n  * Seniorenportal\n  * Spiele\n  * Streaming Guide\n\n  * Das t\u00e4gliche Quiz\n\nAlle Magazine des SPIEGEL\n\n  * DER SPIEGEL\n  * SPIEGEL GESCHICHTE\n  * SPIEGEL COACHING\n  * SPIEGEL WISSEN\n  * Dein SPIEGEL\n  * SPIEGEL BESTSELLER\n  * SPIEGEL CHRONIK\n  * SPIEGEL SPEZIAL\n  * SPIEGEL START\n  * SPIEGEL GELD\n  * S-Magazin\n  * SPIEGEL EDITION\n\nSPIEGEL Gruppe\n\nAbo Abo k\u00fcndigen Shop manager magazin Harvard Business manager 11FREUNDE\nWerbung Jobs MANUFAKTUR SPIEGEL Akademie SPIEGEL Ed\n\nImpressum Datenschutz Nutzungsbedingungen Teilnahmebedingungen Cookies &\nTracking Newsletter Kontakt Hilfe Text- & Nutzungsrechte\n\nFacebook Instagram Wo Sie uns noch folgen k\u00f6nnen\n\n", "frontpage": false}
