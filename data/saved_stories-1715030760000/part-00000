For teams to solve incidents quickly\nand effectively, responders need to be able to trust each other and\nstakeholders have to trust the responders. This level of trust is hard to\ncultivate if your organization doesn\u2019t have a significant amount of\npsychological safety.\n\nWhat is psychological safety\n\nThe term psychological safety was coined in the 1950s by psychologist Carl\nRogers. It\u2019s been applied in various ways to different types of environments\nand organizations, including manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace.\nThe direct impact of psychological safety on technology teams has been\npublished and popularized by Harvard professor Amy Edmondson, author of Right\nKind of Wrong: The Science of Failing Well and other books about\norganizational learning.\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard of psychological safety, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve encountered Dr.\nEdmondson\u2019s definition:\n\n> A belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with\n> ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes, and that the team is safe for\n> interpersonal risk-taking.\n\nFolks who have worked in organizations with low psychological safety will\nrecognize what this can mean: punishment for asking too many questions; firing\nfor making mistakes. These negative outcomes derail or prevent the kind of\norganizational learning we want from incidents, and can hamper incident\nresponse itself.\n\nHow psychological safety contributes to incident response\n\nLooking at the definition of psychological safety specifically as it relates\nto incident response hopefully brings some things to mind. The main one you\nmay already be fearing is being fired from your job for \u201ccausing\u201d or\ncontributing to an incident. The fear of losing a job has caused a lot of\nissues in various industries, and has led to some psychological safety horror\nstories.\n\nIf you are included as a responder, incident commander, or other participant\nin an incident, you want to be able to share ideas and speak freely about the\ncurrent state of the environment. Responders who aren\u2019t able, or are too\nfearful to speak up during an incident call can\u2019t help. Their knowledge is\nsequestered away from the responders, and it might be needed.\n\nSimilarly with asking questions \u2013 in most environments, but especially in\nmodern, distributed environments, responders need to be able to ask questions\nwithout judgment and ridicule. It\u2019s common for folks to not know exactly how\ndeep the dependent systems go, how they are used, or which of the many\ndatabases or other resources are acting up. Asking questions during an\nincident call is crucial so everyone on the call knows the impacts and\nramifications of what is going on.\n\nWe also want everyone to be comfortable expressing their concerns. One of the\npractices we recommend for incident commanders is to gain consensus about any\nactions taken during an incident that might change the state of the system. We\nask \u201care there any strong objections?\u201d and we expect anyone on the call who\ndoes have objections or concerns to speak up.\n\nWe also want to incorporate psychological safety into the entire incident\nprocess, including the post-incident review. You may already be familiar with\nthe concept of blamelessness. We want to approach the post-incident review\nwith an open mind and by first acknowledging that complex systems are hard to\nreason about. Mistakes can be made! What\u2019s more, the transient nature of\nmodern systems means that an action that worked fine last month might have\nactually been a contributing cause to an incident this month.\n\nHow to build a more safe team\n\nWhat can or should you do if you feel like your team or organization isn\u2019t as\npsychologically safe as it needs to be to respond to incidents effectively?\nThere are some practices that can help, even as an individual contributor.\n\n  * Encourage open communication and question asking. Engage with your team, your peers, and others in the organization. Make sure you are asking questions when you need to \u2013 be an example.\n  * Foster a learning environment and mindset. Set aside blame when things go wrong. Ask how the system can be improved to better support the humans that work on it. Acknowledge your own mistakes and talk through them with your team.\n  * Be curious and experiment. Find the methods and practices that work for your organizational culture. Stretch your mindset and try new things if what you have isn\u2019t serving you well.\n\nAll of these things will benefit your team in your day-to-day work, not just\nduring incidents. It can take time to build the foundations you\u2019ll need.\nAdditionally, a major incident in a distributed environment might require\ninvolvement from more than one functional team to get to a resolution. Your\nentire organization should be working towards more psychological safety to\nproduce better outcomes during incidents.\n\nResources\n\nIf this all sounds challenging, don\u2019t worry!
