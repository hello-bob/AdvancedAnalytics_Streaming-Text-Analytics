With this, the main obstacle is the limited exogenous uptake by\nthe central nervous system (CNS), making creatine only effective over a long-\nterm diet of weeks. Thus far, only repeated dosing of creatine over weeks has\nbeen studied, yielding detectable changes in CNS levels. Based on the\nhypothesis that a high extracellular creatine availability and increased\nintracellular energy consumption will temporarily increase the central\ncreatine uptake, subjects were orally administered a high single dose of\ncreatinemonohydrate (0.35 g/kg) while performing cognitive tests during sleep\ndeprivation. Two consecutive ^31P-MRS scans, ^1H-MRS, and cognitive tests were\nperformed each at evening baseline, 3, 5.5, and 7.5 h after single dose\ncreatine (0.35 g/kg) or placebo during sub-total 21 h sleep deprivation (SD).\nOur results show that creatine induces changes in PCr/Pi, ATP, tCr/tNAA,\nprevents a drop in pH level, and improves cognitive performance and processing\nspeed. These outcomes suggest that a high single dose of creatine can\npartially reverse metabolic alterations and fatigue-related cognitive\ndeterioration.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Preserved wake-dependent cortical excitability dynamics predict cognitive\nfitness beyond age-related brain alterations\n\nArticle Open access 03 December 2019\n\n### Effects of exercise training on brain metabolism and cognitive functioning\nin sleep apnea\n\nArticle Open access 08 June 2022\n\n### Impact of sleep duration on executive function and brain structure\n\nArticle Open access 03 March 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe modern lifestyle and work pressure favor sleep deprivation (SD), leading\nto more accidents, reduced performance, and chronic diseases. To diminish\nthese negative consequences, psychoactive substances such as caffeine gained\nimmense popularity in recent decades. The sports community appreciates\ncreatine in an ergogenic sense, to enhance physical peak performance.\nProtective effects in cell culture and ex vivo studies^1 and cognitive\nimprovements^2,3,4, motivated studies of creatine supplementation in\nneurodegenerative diseases^5,6,7,8. In sleep disorders and SD, changes in\ncreatine-related metabolites were observed using ^1H-MRS or ^31P-MRS in\nhumans^9,10,11,12,13,14 and enzymatic assays or high pressure liquid\nchromatography (HPLC) in animals^10,15.\n\nUp to now, studies about a prolonged diet of oral creatine supplementation\nover a minimum period of 1 week observed an increase in neural total CR (tCr)\nand PCr, a decrease in ATP and glutamate (Glu), and improvements in cognitive\nperformance^2,6,16,17,18,19. All are metabolites that are inversely affected\nby SD and sleep disorders.\n\nCreatine is of low water solubility, poor and delayed bioavailability, and\ndoes not diffuse passively through cell membranes. Its uptake into the CNS is\nassured and limited by the creatine transporter CreatT (SLC6A8) operating near\nsaturation and expressed in the endothelial cell layer of the blood\u2013brain\nbarrier (BBB) but not in its layer of astrocyte feet^20. Furthermore, the\nsynthetic pathway comprises the arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT)\nfollowed by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT). AGAT and GAMT were\ndetected in all brain cell types, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes,\nbut rarely co-expressed in the same cell. CNS uptake of exogenous creatine\nfrom the periphery is marginal and takes a long time. Therefore, most studies\ninvestigating the effect of creatine supplementation on cerebral metabolites,\nrequire a minimum period of 1 week or longer. A study by^21, starting with\nearly measurements after 3 days of Cr supplementation, found no significant\nchange in cerebral tCr level in the brain. Nevertheless, the kinetics of\ncreatine serum levels in humans have been extensively studied also after a 20\ng single oral dose, reaching a maximum at 2.5 h (T_max) and decreasing to\nhalf-maximum at 5 h^22. Perasso et al.^23 showed the uptake of [^14C] creatine\ninto rat brain reaching a plateau after 2.5 h and lasting for 9 h after\nintraperitoneal 160 mg/kg creatine. Other studies have found increased\ncreatine levels when supplemented in a modified form or mixed with additional\ncomponents^8,24. These results indicate that intracellular creatine uptake on\na short time scale is possible under certain conditions. The study aimed to\nprove whether a high extracellular availability of creatine can compensate for\nmetabolic changes and cognitive impairment during sleep deprivation.\n\nHence, the kinetics of cerebral phosphate-metabolites and cognitive\nperformance has been studied in a time range of 8 h after acute single dose\ncreatine (0.35 g/kg) versus placebo during the first two-thirds of a night\nwithout sleep using ^1H-MRS, ^31P-MRS, and cognitive tasks at four-time\npoints.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Study participants\n\nFifteen healthy subjects (8 females, aged 23 \u00b1 2 years, range 20\u201328, 13 right\nhanded) participated. None had signs of sleep disorders, psychiatric or\nneurological diseases, alcohol or drug abuse, were smokers, or took any\nmedication. To rule out symptoms of sleep problems, a seven-item questionnaire\nInsomnia Severity Index (ISI) of two last weeks were performed. Caffeine and\noccasional alcohol intake were stopped at least 48 h before the measurement\nnights and not resumed in between. Subjects were requested to sleep every\nnight at 11 p.m., wake up at 7 a.m. in the morning, and record their\nsleep/wake time 2 weeks before and between the sessions. The study was in\naccordance with the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics\ncommittee of the Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University. Informed consent\nwas obtained from all subjects for the study.\n\n### Experimental procedure\n\nThis trial was a double-blind, randomized, prospective with balanced cross-\nover design. Verum (creatinemonohydrate, AlzChem, Trostberg) and placebo (corn\nstarch, Caelo GmbH) were prepared, blinded, and arranged in pair-wise\nrandomized, balanced order by the university hospital pharmacy Mainz. Every\nsubject was measured at two nights (Fig. 1A) with a minimum interval of 5 days\n(max. 27, mean 10 \u00b1 6 days) in between. The study was conducted at the\nUniversity Hospital RWTH Aachen, Germany. Throughout both sessions, subjects\nstayed in a lab room next to the MRI scanner in a dimly lit and quiet\nenvironment under consistent and constant conditions. They were not allowed to\nsleep, permanently supervised, optically monitored, and spoken to whenever\ninitial signs of falling asleep occurred. No cognitively stressful activities\nsuch as working on a laptop, watching movies, or playing games were permitted,\nwhile the consumption of drinks, and light foods such as nonmeat snacks were\nallowed. At one night, 0.35 g/kg creatine was administered, at the other, 0.35\ng/kg placebo. A positive and negative affect schedule PANAS^25 was acquired\nonce initially per session. Karolinska Sleepiness Scores (KSS, ranged from 1\nto 10) and fatigue score (FAT, ranged from 1 to 20) were performed before and\nafter each run. FAT was the 10-item inverted version of the Samn and Perelli\nFatigue score^26,27.\n\nFigure 1\n\n(A) Study design. Subjects were administered creatine at 8:30 p.m. in one\nsession and placebo in another, spaced at least five days in random order.\nSeven participants completed the verum and eight the placebo as the first\ncondition. Cognitive and metabolic parameters were acquired in four runs,\nbaseline starting at 6 p.m., the other at 0 a.m., 2 a.m., and 4 a.m. Each\nsession took 1 h:35 min and comprised two ^31P-MRS-, three ^1H-MRS\nmeasurements, followed by fatigue scores, psychomotor vigilance tests (PVT),\nand other cognitive tasks (Cog.Test). (B) Positioning of three single voxel\n^1H-MR-spectroscopy (PRESS) voxels (left, red) and two 8 \u00d7 8 ^31P-MRS CSI\ngrids (right, white) in coronal, transversal and sagittal view. Isotropic\nvoxel size was (25 mm)^3 except for the frontal PRESS-voxel of double volume.\nExemplary spectra are given with some signals assigned. Signals exploited in\nthis study were of ^31P-MRS Pi at \u22485 ppm, PCr set at 0 ppm and the ATP-\u03b2-\nsignal at \u2212 16.3 ppm, of ^1H-MRS the CH_3-signal at 3.2 ppm, and the\nCH_2-signal at 3.92 ppm of creatine (total creatine, tCr), N-acetyl-aspartate\n(NAA) at 2.0 ppm and signals of glutamate (Glu) at 2.35 (C3, C4-protons) and\nglutamine or glutamate (Glx) at 3.75 ppm (C2-proton).\n\nFull size image\n\nAfter the baseline measurement run which started at 6:10 p.m. (\u00b1 15 min),\nsubjects were orally administered with 0.35 g/kg creatine or 0.35 g/kg placebo\nat 8:28 p.m. (\u00b1 12 min) and measured in subsequent runs at 11:33 p.m. (\u00b1 14\nmin), 1:39 a.m. (\u00b1 14 min) and 3:44 a.m. (\u00b1 14 min), from now on referred to\nas 0 a.m., 2 a.m., 4 a.m. The 3 time points were chosen to follow the course\neffect of creatine, which according to Schedel et al.^22, extends a time range\nof up to 7 h in plasma and reaches a maximum level of 3 h after injection.\n\nEach run comprised two ^31P-MRS measurements, three ^1H-MRS measurements, and\na neuropsychological test battery outside the scanner (Fig. 1A,B). Only in the\nbaseline session cognitive performance tests were carried out before MRS\nmeasurements. The aim of exchanging the order at baseline was to prevent a\ncognitive performance associated fatigue compensation in metabolic changes\nwhen creatine was orally administered. Including preparing, adjustments and\nshimming, the average duration of a MRS measurement was 1 h:15 min (\u00b1 10 min).\nSubjects had to fix a spot with open eyes in the scanner, were equipped with a\npulse oximeter, and were permanently monitored. After MRS, subjects did\ncognitive tasks lasting 18 min:54 s. (\u00b1 1 min).\n\n#### Cognitive scores and tasks\n\nThe test battery consisted of a Psychomotor Vigilance test (PVT, 6 min \u00b1 10\ns), Word Memory Test (WMT, 2 min \u00b1 42 s), forward memory digit span test\n(SPAN, 30 s \u00b1 7 s), spatial N-Back (3-Back) (2 min:25 s \u00b1 8 s) and multiple-\nchoice tasks in language (2 min:30 s \u00b1 8 s), logic (3 min:27 s \u00b1 60 s) and\nnumeric (2 min:40 s \u00b1 47 s). The processing time of each task was recorded.\nBefore beginning the study, each subject completed a training run of all\ntasks.\n\nThe PVT^28 measuring and immediately indicating reaction time was carried out\non a Pocket PC hp jornada 560 Microsoft. In a dark environment, subjects had\nto press a button upon the appearance of a green light LED. Trials lasting\nlonger than 850ms were classified as lapses.\n\n##### Memory tasks\n\nWord Memory Test (WMT) and SPAN were programmed with Visual Basic Application\n6.0 (VBA) in Microsoft Excel. The WMT, adapted from^29,30 consisted of 22\npairs of German nouns (e.g., climate\u2014storm). 4 additional dummy word pairs at\nthe beginning and the end were used to avoid the primacy and recency effect.\nEach word pair was presented for 5 s. In the recall phase, subjects had to\ntype the second word of the pair upon presentation of the first word without\ntime pressure. SPAN contained 12 random single-digit numbers that were\ndisplayed for 5 s. Thereafter subjects were requested to type the number in\nthe same order without time pressure. A total of 8 different lists for 8\nsessions were prepared for both tasks. The order of the lists, word pairs, and\nnumbers within each list was randomized for each subject. The spatial triple\nN-back (3-back) was provided with the Brain workshop software^31 Version\n4.8.4. Two consecutive tests were performed each lasting 72 s (24 trials each\n3 s). In a sequence, squares appeared on a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix and the button had to\nbe pressed if the actual square presentation matched the third before. Correct\nand wrong answers were counted.\n\n##### Cognitive multiple-choice tests\n\nCovered were the categories language (21 tasks), logic (17 tasks), and numeric\n(8 tasks), chosen from the IQ-Test training^32. Language sub-categories\ncomprised finding analogies (5 tasks), arranging 5 letters to one word (7\ntasks), finding words with common generic terms (4 tasks) and those not\nmatching to a list (5 tasks). Logical tasks were the completion of figure\npatterns (8 tasks), mental rotation such as rotating and flipping figures (4\ntasks), mapping and folding figures (3 tasks), and turning and tilting of dice\n(2 tasks). Numeric tasks were completing number sequences by finding the\npattern (4 tasks) and addition of numbers (4 tasks). A total of 8 different\nbatteries were prepared for 8 runs and divided into series A and B (each\ncontaining 4 batteries) for the two measurement nights. The order of both\nseries was randomized and balanced over subjects.\n\n### MRI/MRS measurement\n\nA 3.0 Tesla Magnetom Prisma Scanner (Siemens) was equipped with a double tuned\n^31P-^1H head coil from Rapid biomedical (W\u00fcrzburg, Germany). Subjects had to\nfix a spot with open eyes and were permanently monitored via mirrors, camera,\nand pulse oximeter. Anatomical reference images were acquired using\nT_1-weighted 2D Flash sequences.\n\n#### ^31P and ^1H MRS sequences\n\nAfter shimming (5 min), two 2D chemical shift imaging (CSI) ^31P-MRS sequences\nwere applied to acquire axial grids of 8 \u00d7 8 voxels (25 mm)^3 over 22 min\neach, first in a middle plane centered onto the thalamus, second above the\ncorpus callosum (Fig. 1B). The first axial CSI slice was positioned in the\nisocenter of the scanner, with its row No. 5 centered mid-sagittally in the\nthalamus region and tilted parallel to the ac-pc plane. Manual shimming was\nperformed to ensure FWHM \u2264 25 Hz. Parameters were: field of view (FOV) = 20 cm\n\u00d7 20 cm, echo time (TE) = 2.3 ms, repetition time (TR) = 3500 ms, averages =\n43, acquisition time (TA) = 22.35 min, tip angle = 90\u00b0, complex points = 1.024\nand bandwidth (BW) = 2 kHz. The second CSI grid was placed adjacent above the\ncorpus callosum (Fig. 1B) using the same parameters and manual shimming. Each\nof the very silent CSI-sequences was applied over 20 min. Acquisition of the\nmiddle CSI-grid was started 20 min after stopping ad libitum activity and\npositioning in the scanner and only 5 min after ending the noise and\nvibrations of the preceding 2D flash sequence, respectively. The upper CSI-\ngrid was acquired immediately after that.\n\nThen, in one (50 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 25 mm^3) frontal\u2014and two (25 mm)^3 medial parietal\nsingle voxels, ^1H-spectroscopy was carried out (Fig. 1B) using a PRESS (WS)\nsequence with the parameters: repetition time (TR) = 3000 ms, echo time (TE) =\n80.0 ms averages = 45, acquisition time (TA) = 2.21 min, tip angle = 90\u00b0,\ncomplex points = 2.048 and bandwidth (BW) = 2 kHz.\n\n### MRS data analysis\n\nIn vivo as well as phantom DICOM ^31P-MRS and ^1H-MRS data were analyzed with\nTARQUIN 4.3.10^33 resulting in single or combined peak integrals. All data\nunderwent a Fourier transformation as well as zero and first order phase\ncorrection.\n\n#### ^31P-CSI\n\nFrom two 8 \u00d7 8 CSI grids, spectra of 2 \u00d7 9 voxels, each, were evaluated\n(listed in Tables S2\u2013S6, 2). Voxels not entirely containing brain tissue were\nexcluded. All data were fitted as linear combinations of the simulated\nmetabolic basis set including PCr, ATP-\u00df, Pi, PE, TCho, GPC, and GPE. While\nPCr, Pi, PE, GPC, and GPE appear as singlet Lorentzian peak, signals from the\n\u03b1- and \u03b3 phosphor atoms in ATP were modeled as doublet and ATP-\u00df as triplet\naccounting for the homonuclear j-coupling (16 Hz) with one or two neighbors\nrespectively. Since the in vivo signals at the ATP-\u00df chemical shift position\noriginate exclusively from ATP, only these were considered to evaluate ATP\nlevels, referred to as NTP by others. As by convention, PCr was set at 0 ppm\nas spectral reference. In addition, all ^31P spectra were ^1H decoupled. The\nk-space filter required for CSI-MRS was switched on resulting in a voxel size\nof 25 mm^3. Regarding fitting parameters, the initial \u00df value, which\ndetermines the mixing ratio of Lorentzian and Gaussian (Voigt) line shape, was\nchosen 600 Hz^2 for the middle and 1000 Hz^2 for the upper CSI slice. The max.\nmetabolite\u2014as well as the max. broad shift, both were set at 3.0 ppm.\nRegarding the post processing, a zero-filling factor of 2 and a line\nbroadening of 10 Hz were used. Figures 1B, 2 shows an individual ^31P spectrum\nof one CSI voxel covering the left thalamus (row 5, column 5) and one ^1H\nspectrum, located in the left superior parietal region acquired at 6 p.m.\n\nFigure 2\n\nPlots of ^1H and ^31P spectra over time, including processed signal, fit (in\ngreen), baseline and residual of left parietal voxel (PRESS), and from one CSI\nvoxel (R5C4) located in the middle grid.\n\nFull size image\n\nFor this study, the ratio to total phosphorus signal of the Tarquin reliable\ndata, including the sum of the signal integral of PCr, ATP-\u00df, Pi, PE, and TCho\n(declared ^31P) was chosen to assess changes within each metabolite.\n\n#### ^1H-PRESS\n\nVoxel signals were fitted as linear combinations of the simulated basis set\nincluding tCr, tNAA, Cho, Glx and GABA for ^1H-MRS. Pre water shift and lipid\nfilter were switched on and fit parameter were chosen: \u00df = 200 Hz^2, water\nattenuation = 0.7, metabolite shift = 1.0, broad shift = 1.0 ppm. Regarding\nthe post processing, a zero-filling factor of 2 and a line broadening of 5 Hz\nwere used.\n\n#### pH calculations\n\nThe pH values were calculated from the chemical shift of Pi, according to the\nderivation of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation^34\n\n$$pH=6.66+{\\text{log}}\\frac{\\delta pi-3.08}{5.57-\\delta pi}$$\n\n(1)\n\nBefore pH means were calculated, the logarithmic pH values were transformed to\nlinear [H_3O] concentrations and thereafter back-transformed to the pH scale.\n\n### Statistics and evaluation\n\nSince the study was longitudinal, the within subject version of the two tailed\nT-test was applicable for the comparison of means in results of MRS and\ncognitive performances. For the intraindividual comparison, a chosen\nstatistical power of 0.90 and effect size of 1.33 (mean difference = 0.04,\npooled standard deviation = 0.025) required a minimum sample size of n = 12\ncalculated by statistical power tool G*Power (Version 3.1.9.7, HHU-\nD\u00fcsseldorf).\n\nChanges versus baseline in cognitive and metabolic parameters in each voxel\nwere calculated by the mean difference between BL (6 p.m.) and another session\n(0 a.m., 2 a.m. or 4 a.m.). Regarding metabolic changes, SD-related variations\nin the spectral quality between time points were included as a weighting\nfactor to allow a more robust and precise analysis (Supp. 2.5). Changes versus\nplacebo were calculated as the difference between the changes (\\\\({\\Delta\n}_{iCr}\\\\)-\\\\({\\Delta }_{iPl}\\\\)) in the creatine and placebo condition. Due\nto the limited sample size, possible false Type error II results have to be\nconsidered. Significance thresholds were adjusted for multiple testing\naccording to the Bonferroni approach. As measurements were carried out at\neight conditions (k = 8, 2 sessions each 4 runs), the \u03b1 thresholds were\nadjusted to \u03b1 = 0.05/8 = 0.0063.\n\nCorrelations in changes of metabolic parameters and cognitive scores were\nanalyzed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient (r) (Supp. 2.5).\n\n### Segmentation, reproducibility and calibration\n\nThe composition of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal\nfluid CSF were segmented (Supp. 2.6, Table S8), and the contribution of signal\nchanges for each voxel due to the spatial displacement between the time points\nwas calculated (Supp. 2.7, 3.4, Tables S9\u2013S12). Furthermore, subject\nvariability across all regions, conditions, and baseline differences between\nboth conditions were compared. Multiple phantom measurements on different\nnights were performed to calculate the signal drifts from the baseline of each\ntime point (Supp. 3.5).\n\n## Results\n\nThe Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) resulted in ISI = 4.6 \u00b1 1.6 (ISI_max \u2264 6).\nThe requested sleep time schedule revealed an average sleep/wake up time of\n11:25 p.m. (\u00b1 33 min) and 7:12 a.m. (\u00b1 53 min) with an average sleep duration\nof 07 h:54 min (\u00b1 43 min) for subjects starting with placebo and 07 h:39 min\n(\u00b1 31min) for those with creatine. Differences in sleep duration between the\nfirst and the second session revealed a nonsignificant deviation of + 8 min (\u00b1\n45 min, p = 0.62, t = 0.53) for the placebo and + 14 min (\u00b1 37 min, p = 0.34,\nt = 1.07) for the creatine group. All 15 subjects completed the study. The SD\nwas effective, significantly impacting established parameters. Nobody fell\nasleep during scans and sessions. Creatine was well tolerated. No gastric\ndiscomfort or other physical complaint was signalized. Wakefulness was\nsteadily confirmed by monitoring responsiveness.\n\nCognitive parameters and mean within changes versus baseline in both\nconditions are given in Tables 1, S1, Figs. 4, S3, S4. Baseline-related\nchanges in cognitive parameters of creatine versus placebo are given in Figs.\n5, S5 and are presented in \u201cCognitive and metabolic response of creatine\nversus placebo\u201d.

Correlations of cognitive and\nmetabolic response are shown in Table S7a\u2013d, Fig. S6. PANAS did not differ\nsignificantly between sessions, with positive and negative subscales amounting\nto 3.2 \u00b1 0.1 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 in the placebo and 3.1 \u00b1 0.2 and 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 in the\ncreatine session.

S3, 3). Decrease in PCr/Pi revealed regional at all timepoints (0\np.m., 2 a.m., 4 a.m.) and in the averaged middle grid (\u2212 4.7 \u00b1 1.0%, p_43 <\n0.00005, t_43 = \u2212 4.53) when pooled at all 3 time points (Table S3, Fig. 4).\npH level of 7.03 (95% Cl 7.00 \u2212 7.07) dropped here significantly by 0.026 \u00b1\n0.03, p_13 = 0.004, t_13 = \u2212 3.43 (95% Cl 7.03 \u2212 6.98) at 2 a.m. and 0.032 \u00b1\n0.029, p_13 = 0.001, t_13 = \u2212 4.19 (95% Cl 7.03 \u2212 6.97) at 4 a.m. (Table S4,\nFigs. 3, 4).\n\nPositive correlations was found in the right hemisphere between cognitive\nperformance (SPAN, PVT, numeric and logic task) and metabolic response in\nPCr/Pi and ATP-\u00df/^31P shown in Table S7a,b, Fig. S6.\n\n### Cognitive and metabolic response to SD after creatine administration\n\nUnder Creatine KSS and FAT progressively increased terminally at 4 a.m. by 145\n\u00b1 9.9% and 122 \u00b1 25%, significant at each versus every preceding time point\n(p_12 < 0.009 vs. baseline and all other comparisons, t_12 > 3.1, Table 1).\nSignificant improvements versus baseline revealed in processing time in\nnumeric task at 0 p.m. (24.5 \u00b1 4.3%, t_13 = 5.0, p_13 = 0.0003) (Table 1, Fig.\nS4) . Further improvements revealed in the language (5.6 \u00b1 2.0%, t_43 = 2.9,\np_43 = 0.003) and numeric (9.6 \u00b1 3.2%, t_43 = 3.2, p_43 = 0.001) task and in\nprocessing time in language (10.6 \u00b1 1.7%, t_43 = 3.1, p_43 = 0.002), logic\n(13.7 \u00b1 2.8%, t_43 = 4.8, p_43 = 0.00001) and numeric (18.4 \u00b1 3.0%, t_43 =\n5.9, p_43 = 2.8 \u00d7 10^\u20137) task when pooled at all 3 time points (Fig. 4).\n\nSupplemented creatine yielded significant increase of cerebral tCr/tNAA versus\nbaseline in the left medial parietal region at 2 a.m. (5.3 \u00b1 4.1%, t_12 = 4.1,\np_12 = 0.003) and when pooled at all 3 time points (4.2 \u00b1 1.4%, t_42 = 2.9,\np_42 = 0.006) (Table S3, Fig. 3, 4). Due to the challenging shimming in the\nfrontal lobe region, ^1H spectra fit values from only 6 subjects were\navailable.\n\nGlobal and regional extensive and progressive change over time revealed in the\nATP-\u00df involved metabolic parameters (Tables S2, S4, Figs. 3, 4, S4).\nSignificant declines occurred in the averaged upper grid in ATP-\u00df/^31P (\u2212 10.9\n\u00b1 2.6%, p_13 = 0.002 at 0 p.m., \u2212 12.8 \u00b1 3.0%, p_13 = 0.002, t_13 = \u2212 3.87 at\n4 a.m.) and ATP-\u00df/PCr (\u2212 12.4 \u00b1 3.1%, p_13 = 0.002, t_13 = \u2212 3.89 at 0 p.m., \u2212\n14.9 \u00b1 3.0%, p_13 = 0.001, t_13 = \u2212 4.45 at 4 a.m.) (Fig. 3).\n\nPositive correlations were found between cognitive performance (WMT, SPAN, PVT\nand numeric) and response in HEP. ATP-\u00df/^31P also revealed a negative\ncorrelation between logic task (Table S7c,d, Fig. S6).\n\n### Cognitive and metabolic response of creatine versus placebo\n\nCreatine significantly reduced fatigue in terms of FAT by 8 \u00b1 7% (Wilcoxon\u2019s\nZ_26 = \u2212 2.84, p = 0.002) at 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. pooled.\n\nSignificant improvements revealed in WMT (10.3 \u00b1 3.8%, t_43 = 2.7, p_43 =\n0.005) and speed in processing time in WMT (17.7 \u00b1 6.0%, t_43 = 3.0, p_43 =\n0.002), language (29.1 \u00b1 5.3%, t_43 = 5.3, p_43 = 2.0 \u00d7 10^\u20136), logic (16.0 \u00b1\n4.0%, t_43 = 3.9, p_43 = 0.0002) and numeric (24.0 \u00b1 4.9%, t_43 = 4.8, p_43 =\n1.02 \u00d7 10^\u20135) task when pooled at all 3 time points (Fig. 5).\n\nCreatine prevented the SD-induced changes in PCr/Pi and pH level. The\nprevention effect was regionally most pronounced in Pi/^31P by a decline\nversus placebo in capsulo-thalamic (right \u2212 8.5 \u00b1 2.8%, t_43 = \u2212 3.63, p_43 =\n0.001; left \u2212 9.6 \u00b1 2.8%, t_43 = \u2212 2.34, p_43 = 0.001), right corpus callosum\n(\u2212 8.3 \u00b1 2.6%, t_43 = \u2212 3.26, p_43 = 0.002) and increase in PCr/^31P in the\nleft medial motor (4.2 \u00b1 1.1%, t_43 = 3.87, p_43 = 0.0005) and left motor (5.7\n\u00b1 1.3%, t_43 = 4.44, p_43 = 0.0001) region when pooled at all 3 time points\n(Fig. 5).\n\nGlobal and regional extensive and progressive change over time revealed in the\nATP-\u00df involved metabolic parameters (Fig. 5, Table 2). Significant declines\nwere reached in the upper grid when pooled at all 3 time points (ATP-\u00df/^31P: \u2212\n8.5 \u00b1 2.8%, p_43 = 0.004, t = \u2212 3.00; ATP-\u00df/PCr: \u2212 11.3 \u00b1 3.9%, p_43 = 0.006,\nt = \u2212 2.88). The declines in ATP-\u00df/^31P were regionally most pronounced in the\nright lateral premotor (ATP-\u00df/^31P: \u2212 15.6 \u00b1 4.9%, t_43 = \u2212 3.21, p_43 =\n0.003; ATP-\u00df), left posterior F1 (ATP-\u00df/^31P: \u2212 13.2 \u00b1 4.0%, t_13 = \u2212 3.32,\np_43 = 0.001), left medial central (ATP-\u00df/^31P: \u2212 11.5 \u00b1 3.5%, t_43 = \u2212 3.29,\np_43 = 0.002), left lateral premotor (ATP-\u00df/^31P: \u2212 18.4 \u00b1 6.2%, t_13 = \u2212\n4.23, p_43 = 0.0001), left motor (ATP-\u00df/^31P: \u2212 18.2 \u00b1 4.4%, t_43 = \u2212 4.12,\np_43 = 0.0002) and left medial premotor (left: ATP-\u00df/^31P \u2212 14.0 \u00b1 3.0%, t_43\n= \u2212 4.67, p_43 = 0.00003) region. Declines in ATP-\u00df/PCr occurred in the same\nextent and degree and are shown in (Table S4, Fig. 5).\n\nPositive correlation revealed between improvements in numeric tasks and\nregional increase in PCr/Pi while in turn improvemnts in PVT were associated\nwith regional decreases in ATP-\u00df (Fig. S6).\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this randomized, controlled, double-blinded cross-over trial, we studied\nthe response of cerebral PCr, ATP, Pi, tCr, Glu levels, and cognitive\nperformance (i) to partial sleep deprivation (SD) versus baseline and (ii) to\na single high dose of creatine versus baseline and placebo during SD. The SD\nled to a profound cognitive and metabolic response. Acute creatine was bio-\navailable to the brain as suggested by increased tCr/tNAA and reduced\nsubjective fatigue compared to the placebo condition. Creatine alleviated\nchanges in phosphates, pH levels and fading of cognitive performance evoked by\nSD. Creatine induced increases in PCr/Pi, declines in ATP, and improvements in\ncognitive perfomance and processing speed exceeding wake baseline.\n\n### Origin of MRS signals and neurochemical aspects\n\nThe measured signals in our study originate from metabolites involved in CK-BB\nin the cytosol. Due to the low viscosity, the resulting high mobility, and\nassociated short correlation time of PCr, ATP, Cr, and Pi, most observed\n^31P-MRS and ^1H signals are restricted to this location. With this, the total\ncreatine tCr, as measured by ^1H-MRS can be considered the sum of Cr and PCr\nsignals. In energy demand, ATPase induces the exergonic breakdown of ATP to\nADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The ATP deficit, in turn, is mainly\ncompensated by the ADP-to-ATP conversion via CK-BB. In this process, the\nphosphate donor PCr brakes down to Cr, leading to a transient decline of PCr.\n\n$${\\text{PCr}} + {\\text{ADP}} + {\\text{H}}^{ + } \\underset{{{\\text{CK-\nMT}}1{\\text{a}}}}{\\overset{{\\text{CK-BB}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}}{\\text{Cr}} +\n{\\text{ATP}}$$\n\n(2)\n\nHence, a temporary decrease of PCr associated with an increase in inorganic\nphosphate (Pi) is a well-established indicator of enhanced cellular energy\nconsumption.\n\n### Cognitive and metabolic response to sleep deprivation\n\nThe partial SD of this study significantly fatigued the subjects (by a factor\nof 3.2 in terms of FAT and KSS), effectively compromised the subject\u2019s\nvigilance (PVT), and deteriorated short-term memory performance in digit SPAN\nand Word Memory Test (WMT). These are tasks known to be sensitive to sleep\ndeprivation.\n\nThe observed decreases in PCr/Pi and pH levels during sleep deprivation in our\nstudy agree with outcomes previously reported by others^10,12,13,15. The quiet\nwake state supine in the scanner during ^31P-MRS did not bring PCr/Pi back to\nbaseline as did a longer period of rest or recovery sleep^10,35. Apparently,\nin contrast to muscular tissue, a longer time and deeper rest are required in\nbrain tissue to regain baseline levels, respectively.\n\nThe changes in PCr/Pi in the right hemisphere showed a performance-related\ndependency between higher levels of PCr/Pi in the temporal region, and scores\nin PVT (0.1 percentile) and SPAN task (Fig. S6). SD and alertness-related\nstudies showed a right hemisphere dependency in neuronal activation in the\nright hemisphere^36,37,38,39,40.\n\nThese results along partial SD of 21 h considerably add to existing knowledge\nsince ^31P-MRS in humans had only been acquired after 36 and 40 h of SD^12,13.\nData on shorter SD only relay on ex vivo studies in animals ^35.\n\n### Cognitive and metabolic response to creatine during SD\n\nCognitive and metabolic effects of creatine could be observed starting from\nthe first time point 3.5 h after creatine administration, well after reaching\nthe reported plateau of serum levels^22.The observed effects lasted or were\naugmented until the last measurement run ending 9 h after administration.\n\nCreatine alleviated SD-induced fatigue and improved short-term memory tasks\n(WMT, SPAN) and reaction speed in PVT after oral creatine administration. In\ncognitive tests, processing time appears to be improved particularly in\nnumeric and language performance 4 h after creatine administration.\nImprovements in complex deductive and executive tasks, memory tasks such as\ndigit span, and reaction speed after SD are well-established effects of sub-\nchronical creatine^2,4,19.\n\nThe high single dose of creatine in the oral formulation chosen was readily\nbioavailable to the brain, as suggested by increased tCr/tNAA in the left\nmedial parietal region until 5.5 h after ingestion.\n\nThe observation was restricted to this region due to the limited voxel\nselection and thus could also occur elsewhere. However, a boosting effect here\nmay have been caused by the higher demand due to the cognitive tests. This is\nsupported by a positive correlation between a higher PCr/Pi level in the left\nantero.-lateral and posterior lateral parietal region and SPAN score at 2 a.m.\n\nIn the global average, except for an increase in some regions, PCr was similar\nto the placebo condition, while Pi and ATP showed significant differences\nversus placebo throughout the 3 time points assessed. Sleep deprivation-\ninduced decreases in PCr/Pi were absent or alleviated in most regions. At the\nlast time point, regional enhancements of PCr versus placebo were observed,\namounting to up to 7% in the medial central and medial premotor region\nsuggesting a progression of accumulation over time.\n\nCreatine-induced decreases of Pi and ATP at relatively constant PCr are also\nwell established for muscular tissue. 5 g creatine/day for 9 days at resting\nstate reduced ATP by 9.1% and increased PCr by 6.6% at constant Pi, while\nunder mild exercise (32% maximal), Pi was decreased by 32% and increased by\n22% under intense exercise (79% maximal) versus un-supplemented baseline^41.\n\nThe responses of PCr/Pi and ATP-\u03b2 to creatine and SD differed on the average\nof the upper and middle CSI-grid, respectively. As this study was double-\nblinded and placebo-controlled, technical artifacts can be ruled out as a\ncause. We conclude that the differential responses of ^31P-signals in the\nupper and middle grid reflect different biological states of the probed\nbrains.\n\nAs with the placebo, the SD-sensitive tasks (WMT, SPAN, and PVT) also showed a\nperformance dependency with higher levels of PCr/Pi after creatine\nadministration. This time, it shows a positive correlation between the PCr/Pi\nlevels in the left parietal region and SPAN. A negative correlation of\nATP-\u00df/^31P in PVT versus placebo indicates a higher high-boosting effect in\nthis region.\n\nAll outcomes above indicate an increased creatine uptake^16,17,18. In an\nequilibrium process, externally added creatine will shift the equilibrium of\ncreatine kinases (Eq. 2) toward less ATP^18. The equation of the law of mass\naction illustrates the quantitative relations:\n\n$$K=\\left(\\frac{PCr}{ATP}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{ADP}^{*}H}{free Cr}\\right)$$\n\n(3)\n\nIncreasing total creatine will enable more transport of available ATP to sites\nof consumption. Regions close to equilibrium will yield increases upon\nexternal addition of free Cr, while regions not at equilibrium due to\ncomparatively high energy demand might show decreases of PCr/ATP throughout\nthe time points assessed. In line with^18 was the observation of increasing\nATP-\u00df in regions with low ATP-\u00df/PCr and a decrease in regions with high\nATP-\u00df/PCr baseline levels. This becomes evident in (Fig. 6) by following the\ninverse course of ATP-\u00df and PCr/ATP after creatine throughout the creatine\nsession (red lines in ATP-\u00df vs. PCr/ATP), as well as comparing placebo versus\ncreatine-associated changes in ATP-\u00df and PCr/ATP separately (black vs. red\nlines in ATP-\u00df, black vs. red lines in PCr/ATP). Based on the mechanism above,\ncreatine appears to compensate for reduced ATP-\u00df. Since the changes in ATP-\u00df\nare higher than in PCr and tCr, it cannot be ruled out that the circadian\neffect contributes as an additional factor to the amount of creatine and leads\nto a more substantial ATP decrease.\n\nFigure 6\n\nTime course of percentual changes from baseline of PCr/^31P, ATP-\u00df/^31P and\nPCr/ATP in selected voxels from left hemisphere at 0 a.m., 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.\nversus baseline 6 p.m. after creatine (red lines) and placebo (black lines).\n\nFull size image\n\nIn contrast to placebo, creatine causes a substantial decrease in ATP-\u00df in the\nleft relative to the right hemisphere at 2 a.m., indicating increasing energy\ndemand in this hemisphere during the session.\n\nFurther evidence for the increased Cr uptake is the observed stabilization or\ndecrease of Pi and a prevented drop of the pH level during SD. Increased Pi,\nsuch as in the case of increased cellular energy consumption, is a robust\nindicator of increased acidity in the cytosol. An effect of creatine\npreventing acidification was reported by Rico-Sanz et al.^41.\n\nThe increase in creatine uptake in such a short period of time is remarkable.\nGiven the absence of SLC6A8 in astrocytic feet\u2019s surrounding the blood\u2013brain-\nbarrier (BBB) and the resulting very limited import from the periphery,\ncreatine in CNS is mainly ensured by the endogenous synthesis driven by AGAT\nand GAMT^42,43. This explains why CNS creatine replenishment takes a long time\nin patients with AGAT or GAMT deficiency treated with creatine. Hence, the\nbrain is resistant and less reliant on exogenous creatine ingestion.\n\nIn view of these results, the question arises of what mechanism caused the\nincrease in intracellular creatine uptake in our study. We suggest the SD\ncondition combined with cognitive activity as a crucial factor triggering\nmultiple mechanisms. SD has been reported to increase cerebral ammonia\nlevels^44, induce abnormalities in adenosine and metabolic response in\nHyperammonemia^45, and lead to altered expression and activity changes of\ngenes involved in AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8^42. An excess of ammonia, such as in\nhyperammonemia, induces an increase in creatine transport^46 and activates the\nSLC6A8 expression in astrocytes, leading to an increased Cr uptake in\nmicrocapillary endothelial cells (MCEC)^42. The SD in our study would induce\nan increased SLC6A8 expression in astrocytes, thus preparing a condition for\nan increased Cr uptake to prevent ammonia toxicity, provided there is a high\nextracellular availability. This is ensured by the administration of a high\ndose creatine. The property of protecting the brain from excess ammonium is\nwhy creatine has been proposed as a suitable candidate for treating\nhyperammonemia patients to protect their developing CNS^20.\n\nA further explanation for the increased Cr uptake concerns the cerebral\nintra\u2014or extracellular activity. Changes in intra\u2014or extracellular creatine\nconcentrations were investigated by Loike et al., Perasso et al.^23,47. The\npassage of creatine against the concentration gradient between plasma and\nbrain cells is assured by active transport via the Na^+\u2014and insulin-dependent\ncreatine transporter creaT (SLC6A8)^48. Hence, it can be assumed that creatine\nuptake is more effective at higher transmembrane Na^+/K^+ gradient and higher\ninsulin. We suggest that increased acidification triggers higher activity in\nsodium hydrogen antiporter protein (NHE and NHE-1), which has the main aim to\ntransport the excess protons into the extracellular space^49,50,51,52. This\nmechanism, in turn, will increase the ATPase-related Na^+-K^+ electrochemical\ngradient, a crucial condition for an increased Na^+ dependent creatine influx.\nAccording to Baldini et al.^49, higher acidification-induced NHE activity has\nalso the potential to release more insulin, a further condition for an\nincreased creatine uptake.\n\nIn conclusion, administering a high dose of creatine has been shown to reverse\npartially cellular stress-induced effects caused by sleep deprivation. Our\nstudy showed a maximum effect 4 h after administration.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur outcomes show that administering a high single dose of creatine can\npartially reverse metabolic alterations and fatigue-related cognitive\ndeterioration. The results revise the established assumption that creatine\nsupplementation only works over a longer period. The crucial factor appears to\nbe the increased energy demand of the neuronal cells in combination with an\nincreased extracellular creatine availability. This condition could overcome\nthe main obstacle, namely the marginal intracellular creatine uptake. It can\nbe concluded that creatine has the potential to be used in prolonged cognitive\nactivity during sleep deprivation. Our study showed the effect of a high dose\nof creatine against sleep deprivation-induced deterioration in cognitive\nperformance, lasting up to 9 h and showing its maximum cognitive effect at 4 h\nafter oral administration. Future research needs to investigate the\nappropriate dose and determine more accurately the time point at which\ncreatine reaches its maximum effect.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data associated with this study are present in the paper.
