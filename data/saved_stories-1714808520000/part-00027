There's over 100,000 of issues filed in our\nissue database, filed by more than 35,000 people over the years (the exact\nnumber is hard to pin down because people sometimes delete their GitHub\naccounts; about 700 issues have been filed by people who have since deleted\ntheir account). Many more people still have used the \"thumbs-up\" reaction to\nindicate that an issue matters to them, with almost 165,000 thumbs up from\nabout 45,000 people. All of these people are valuable contributors to Flutter.\n\nUsually, when pressed, people try to clarify by asking about \"the core team\".\nAgain though it's hard to say exactly what that means, but let's assume they\nmean \"people with commit access\". That is, people we trust enough to have\nadded to the GitHub repo as collaborators. This includes people who work on\nFlutter for companies like Google, Canonical, or Nevercode, and it includes\npeople like me who are self-employed and/or contribute to Flutter on a\nvolunteer basis. Currently that's about 280 people. So is that the answer?\nWell, no, not really. Some people have commit access but aren't active (maybe\nthey got access because of their employer, but were then reassigned to work on\nanother project, and the bureaucracy hasn't caught up with them yet \u2014 we only\naudit the membership occasionally because it's rather tedious to do). Some\npeople have been very active recently but don't have commit access (e.g.\nbecause they were just laid off and a bot automatically removed their access;\nthey might even resume working on Flutter in the future, as a volunteer or\nfunded by another company).\n\nSo what's the answer?\n\nI recently drilled down through our data to see if I could answer this. I will\ncaveat the following numbers by saying that this changes all the time. We\nadded a new team member just today (hi Nate!) who is not counted as a team\nmember in the following numbers because we collected the data a few weeks ago\n(it takes literally days to scrape all the data from GitHub, and then hours to\nexplore the resulting very large and very slow spreadsheet). Also, some of my\ndefinitions are a bit arbitrary, and slightly tweaking the limits would\nprobably change the numbers noticeably.\n\nFirst, I collected a list of everyone who has ever created an issue, commented\non an issue, put an emoji reaction on the first comment of an issue, or\nsubmitted a PR, excluding bots and people who deleted their GitHub account.\n(Actually Piinks did the actual data collection. Thanks!) I limited this to a\nsubset of the GitHub repos of the flutter org that is relatively inclusive but\ndoes not count everything (we have a lot of historical repositories and so\nforth). This finds about 94,357 people. (So there you go. The Flutter team is\nabout a hundred thousand people!)\n\nTo avoid padding the numbers with people who left the project long ago, and to\navoid counting \"drive-by\" contributors who came, did a bunch of work, and then\nleft, I then limited the data set to people who contributed over a period of\nmore than 180 days, and who last contributed sometime in 2024. Because of the\ndefinition of \"contributed\" described above, that means that someone who added\na thumbs-up to an issue in December 2020 and then filed an issue in January\n2024, and did nothing else, is included, but someone who submitted two PRs in\nMarch 2024 is not. Like I said, this is a bit arbitrary. Anyway, that leaves\n3,839 people, of which 182 currently have commit access, 27 once had commit\naccess but don't currently (these are mainly people who either got laid off\nrecently and had their commit access revoked by an automated process, or\npeople who were once team members, left, lost access from inactivity long ago,\nand then later came to comment on issues or file new issues \u2014 it's\nsurprisingly common for people who once worked on Flutter full time to stick\naround even when their employment changes), and about 3,627 people who have\nnever had commit access.\n\nOf those who have never had commit access, 2,407 have filed at least one issue\nor submitted at least one PR (accounting for a total of 12,383 issues and\n2,613 PRs). Of those, 341 have filed 5 to 9 issues (2,242 issues total), and\n296 have filed 10 or more issues in their lifetime (7,021 total issues).\nSimilarly, of the \"never had commit access\" cohort, 73 people have sent 5 to 9\npull requests in their lifetime (458 total PRs) and 47 have sent 10 or more\n(1,321 PRs total). (For context, 4,663 people have ever submitted a pull\nrequest, and 429 have ever submitted more than 10 PRs.)\n\nOf the people who currently have commit access, 98 people have submitted more\nthan one PR every 3 weeks on average since they first got involved (accounting\nfor 49,173 PRs), 75 people have closed at least one issue every 3 weeks\n(accounting for 48,490 total issue closures), of which 10 are not in the first\ngroup (mostly that's our triage team), and 150 people have commented at least\nonce every 3 weeks.\n\nA follow-up question a lot of people ask is \"do they all work for Google?\".\n\nThis is a surprisingly hard question to answer. There are a lot of weird edge\ncases. For example, one person worked on Flutter for a company that Google\nhired to work on Flutter, but then quit that company, asked for their commit\nprivileges to be removed, but continued to be active in the community. Several\npeople who have quit Google (such as myself), or been laid off by Google, have\ncontinued to be active in one sense or another (I think I submit more code to\nFlutter now than I did in my last year at Google).\n\nIt's also hard to answer because a lot more people at Google contribute to\nFlutter than just those on Google's Flutter team, and a lot of people on\nGoogle's Flutter team contribute in ways that don't show up on GitHub (e.g.\nproduct management, marketing, developer relations, internal tooling).\n\nOf the 98 people who have commit access, have been active for more than 180\ndays, have contributed at least once this year, and have submitted more than\none PR every 3 weeks on average for the entire time they've been contributing,\nI estimate (based on what I know of people's employment and so forth) that\nabout 85% are Googlers or somehow get their funding from Google, and about 15%\nare currently independent of Google. (This is by no means the entirety of the\nGoogle team contributing to Flutter; as I mentioned earlier, many folks at\nGoogle working on Flutter don't appear in these statistics.)\n\nI'm not sure what conclusion to draw from this; it's both more people than I\nexpected to see funded by Google, which is great, and fewer people that aren't\nfunded by Google, which is less great. On the other hand, it's still a\nsignificant number of non-Google-funded people.\n\nIs it enough? I think that really depends on what your goals are. I think if\nyour goal is for Flutter to be an order of magnitude better than other UI\nframeworks, then frankly no, it's not enough. There is a ton of work to be\ndone to get there. We know what it would take, but we don't have the people to\ndo it today. On the other hand if your goal is to be a great framework, on par\nwith others, then it's probably adequate. It would certainly be difficult to\ncontinue to be great with fewer people today. Of course, that may change as we\ncomplete big efforts, or as we take on new ones, or as the landscape changes,\nit's all hard to predict.\n\nThat said, I would love to see more direct contributions from non-Google\nsources, if for no other reason but to end this silly \"will Google cancel\nFlutter\" line of questioning that has followed the project since its\ninception. It's a dumb question. Flutter's an open source UI framework. It\nwill never die. It will become old and something else will shine brighter one\nday, just as happens with literally every other UI framework ever. That's just\nhow our industry works. There's no reason to believe that'll happen any time\nsoon though, and certainly no reason for it to happen earlier for Flutter than\nany other modern UI framework.\n\nHome - Index - RSS - Log In\n\nCarbon Neutral Hosting by DreamHost\n\n", "frontpage": false}
