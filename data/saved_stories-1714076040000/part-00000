The four most popular apps\u2014built\nby major internet companies like Baidu, Tencent, and iFlytek\u2014basically account\nfor all the typing methods that Chinese people use. Researchers also looked\ninto the keyboard apps that come preinstalled on Android phones sold in China.\n\nWhat they discovered was shocking. Almost every third-party app and every\nAndroid phone with preinstalled keyboards failed to protect users by properly\nencrypting the content they typed. A smartphone made by Huawei was the only\ndevice where no such security vulnerability was found.\n\nIn August 2023, the same researchers found that Sogou, one of the most popular\nkeyboard apps, did not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) when transmitting\nkeystroke data to its cloud server for better typing predictions. Without TLS,\na widely adopted international cryptographic protocol that protects users from\na known encryption loophole, keystrokes can be collected and then decrypted by\nthird parties.\n\n\u201cBecause we had so much luck looking at this one, we figured maybe this\ngeneralizes to the others, and they suffer from the same kinds of problems for\nthe same reason that the one did,\u201d says Jeffrey Knockel, a senior research\nassociate at the Citizen Lab, \u201cand as it turns out, we were unfortunately\nright.\u201d\n\nEven though Sogou fixed the issue after it was made public last year, some\nSogou keyboards preinstalled on phones are not updated to the latest version,\nso they are still subject to eavesdropping.\n\nThis new finding shows that the vulnerability is far more widespread than\npreviously believed.\n\n## Related Story\n\nThe fascinating evolution of typing Chinese characters\n\nFrom Wubi to Zhineng ABC, here are the different ways Chinese people have\ntyped their language over the years.\n\n\u201cAs someone who also has used these keyboards, this was absolutely\nhorrifying,\u201d says Mona Wang, a PhD student in computer science at Princeton\nUniversity and a coauthor of the report.\n\n\u201cThe scale of this was really shocking to us,\u201d says Wang. \u201cAnd also, these are\ncompletely different manufacturers making very similar mistakes independently\nof one another, which is just absolutely shocking as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe massive scale of the problem is compounded by the fact that these\nvulnerabilities aren\u2019t hard to exploit. \u201cYou don\u2019t need huge supercomputers\ncrunching numbers to crack this. You don\u2019t need to collect terabytes of data\nto crack it,\u201d says Knockel. \u201cIf you\u2019re just a person who wants to target\nanother person on your Wi-Fi, you could do that once you understand the\nvulnerability.\u201d\n\nThe ease of exploiting the vulnerabilities and the huge payoff\u2014knowing\neverything a person types, potentially including bank account passwords or\nconfidential materials\u2014suggest that it\u2019s likely they have already been taken\nadvantage of by hackers, the researchers say. But there\u2019s no evidence of this,\nthough state hackers working for Western governments targeted a similar\nloophole in a Chinese browser app in 2011.\n\nMost of the loopholes found in this report are \u201cso far behind modern best\npractices\u201d that it\u2019s very easy to decrypt what people are typing, says\nJedidiah Crandall, an associate professor of security and cryptography at\nArizona State University, who was consulted in the writing of this report.\nBecause it doesn\u2019t take much effort to decrypt the messages, this type of\nloophole can be a great target for large-scale surveillance of massive groups,\nhe says.\n\nAfter the researchers got in contact with companies that developed these\nkeyboard apps, the majority of the loopholes were fixed. But a few companies\nhave been unresponsive, and the vulnerability still exists in some apps and\nphones, including QQ Pinyin and Baidu, as well as in any keyboard app that\nhasn\u2019t been updated to the latest version. Baidu, Tencent, iFlytek, and\nSamsung did not immediately reply to press inquiries sent by MIT Technology\nReview.\n\nOne potential cause of the loopholes\u2019 ubiquity is that most of these keyboard\napps were developed in the 2000s, before the TLS protocol was commonly adopted\nin software development. Even though the apps have been through numerous\nrounds of updates since then, inertia could have prevented developers from\nadopting a safer alternative.\n\nThe report points out that language barriers and different tech ecosystems\nprevent English- and Chinese-speaking security researchers from sharing\ninformation that could fix issues like this more quickly. For example, because\nGoogle\u2019s Play store is blocked in China, most Chinese apps are not available\nin Google Play, where Western researchers often go for apps to analyze.\n\nSometimes all it takes is a little additional effort. After two emails about\nthe issue to iFlytek were met with silence, the Citizen Lab researchers\nchanged the email title to Chinese and added a one-line summary in Chinese to\nthe English text. Just three days later, they received an email from iFlytek,\nsaying that the problem had been resolved.\n\n### by Zeyi Yang\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
