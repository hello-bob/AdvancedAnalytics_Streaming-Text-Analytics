Whilst it should\n> be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of machine learning\n> techniques, it was originally written for research students, and focuses on\n> issues that are of particular concern within academic research, such as the\n> need to do rigorous comparisons and reach valid conclusions. It covers five\n> stages of the machine learning process: what to do before model building,\n> how to reliably build models, how to robustly evaluate models, how to\n> compare models fairly, and how to report results.\n\nComments:| 28 pages  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2108.02497 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2108.02497v4 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2108.02497arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Michael Lones [view email] [v1] Thu, 5 Aug 2021 10:15:17 UTC (18 KB)\n[v2] Tue, 6 Sep 2022 15:14:17 UTC (20 KB) [v3] Thu, 9 Feb 2023 15:13:01 UTC\n(2,996 KB) [v4] Wed, 3 Jan 2024 15:35:30 UTC (3,113 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled How to avoid machine learning pitfalls: a guide\nfor academic researchers, by Michael A.
