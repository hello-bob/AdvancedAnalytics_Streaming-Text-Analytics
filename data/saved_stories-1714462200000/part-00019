Now, thanks to advances in generative\nartificial intelligence (AI), they might be able to design these systems with\nthe push of a button.\n\nThis week, researchers published details of how they used a generative AI tool\ncalled a protein language model \u2014 a neural network trained on millions of\nprotein sequences \u2014 to design CRISPR gene-editing proteins, and were then able\nto show that some of these systems work as expected in the laboratory^1.\n\nAnd in February, another team announced that it had developed a model trained\non microbial genomes, and used it to design fresh CRISPR systems, which are\ncomprised of a DNA or RNA-cutting enzyme and RNA molecules that direct the\nmolecular scissors as to where to cut^2.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just scratching the surface. It\u2019s showing that it\u2019s possible to\ndesign these complex systems with machine-learning models,\u201d says Ali Madani, a\nmachine-learning scientist and chief executive of the biotechnology firm\nProfluent, based in Berkeley, California. Madani\u2019s team reported what it says\nis \u201cthe first successful editing of the human genome by proteins designed\nentirely with machine learning\u201d in a 22 April preprint^1 on bioRxiv.org (which\nhasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed).\n\nAlan Wong, a synthetic biologist at the University of Hong Kong, whose team\nhas used machine learning to optimize CRISPR^3, says that naturally occurring\ngene-editing systems have limitations in terms of the sequences that they can\ntarget and the sort of changes that they can make. For some applications,\ntherefore, it can be a challenge to find the right CRISPR. \u201cExpanding the\nrepertoire of editors, using AI, could help,\u201d he says.\n\n## Trained on genomes\n\nWhereas chatbots such as ChatGPT are designed to handle language after being\ntrained on existing text, the CRISPR-designing AIs were instead trained on\nvast troves of biological data in the form of protein or genome sequences. The\ngoal of this \u2018pre-training\u2019 step is to imbue the models with insight into\nnaturally occurring genetic sequences, such as which amino acids tend to go\ntogether. This information can then be applied to tasks such as the creation\nof totally new sequences.\n\nMadani\u2019s team previously used a protein language model they developed, called\nProGen, to come up with new antibacterial proteins^4. To devise new CRISPRs,\nhis team retrained an updated version of ProGen with examples of millions of\ndiverse CRISPR systems, which bacteria and other single-celled microbes called\narchaea use to fend off viruses.\n\nBecause CRISPR gene-editing systems comprise not only proteins, but also RNA\nmolecules that specify their target, Madani\u2019s team developed another AI model\nto design these \u2018guide RNAs\u2019.\n\nThe team then used the neural network to design millions of new CRISPR protein\nsequences that belong to dozens of different families of such proteins found\nin nature. To see whether AI-designed CRISPRs were bona fide gene editors,\nMadani\u2019s team synthesized DNA sequences corresponding to more than 200 protein\ndesigns belonging to the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 system that is now widely used in the\nlaboratory. When they inserted these sequences \u2014 instructions for a Cas9\nprotein and a \u2018guide RNA\u2019 \u2014 into human cells, many of the gene editors were\nable to precisely cut their intended targets in the genome.\n\nThe most promising Cas9 protein \u2014 a molecule they\u2019ve named OpenCRISPR-1 \u2014 was\njust as efficient at cutting targeted DNA sequences as a widely used bacterial\nCRISPR\u2013Cas9 enzyme, and it made far fewer cuts in the wrong place. The\nresearchers also used the OpenCRISPR-1 design to create a base editor \u2014 a\nprecision gene-editing tool that changes individual DNA \u2018letters\u2019 \u2014 and found\nthat it, too, was as efficient as other base-editing systems, as well as less\nprone to errors.\n\nAnother team, led by Brian Hie, a computational biologist at Stanford\nUniversity in California, and by bioengineer Patrick Hsu at the Arc Institute\nin Palo Alto, California, used an AI model capable of generating both protein\nand RNA sequences. Their model, called EVO, was trained on 80,000 genomes from\nbacteria and archaea, as well as other microbial sequences, amounting to 300\nbillion DNA letters. Hie and Hsu\u2019s team has not yet tested its designs in the\nlab. But predicted structures of some of the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 systems they designed\nresemble those of natural proteins. Their work was described in a preprint^2\nposted on bioRxiv.org, and has not been peer-reviewed.\n\n## Precision medicine\n\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d says Noelia Ferruz Capapey, a computational biologist at\nthe Molecular Biology Institute of Barcelona in Spain. She\u2019s impressed by the\nfact that researchers can use the OpenCRISPR-1 molecule without restriction,\nunlike with some patented gene-editing tools. The ProGen2 model and \u2018atlas\u2019 of\nCRISPR sequences used to fine-tune it are also freely available.\n\nThe hope is that AI-designed gene-editing tools could be better suited to\nmedical applications than are existing CRISPRs, says Madani. Profluent, he\nadds, is hoping to partner with companies that are developing gene-editing\ntherapies to test AI-generated CRISPRs. \u201cIt really necessitates precision and\na bespoke design. And I think that just can\u2019t be done by copying and pasting\u201d\nfrom naturally-occurring CRISPR systems, he says.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01243-w\n\n## References\n\n  1.
