Supported by decades of visionary\nrobotics innovation and years of practical experience, Boston Dynamics is\ntackling the next commercial frontier.\n\nThis week we announced the retirement of our hydraulic Atlas and unveiled what\ncomes next\u2014a fully electric Atlas robot designed for real-world applications.\nThe next generation of the Atlas program builds on decades of research and\nfurthers our commitment to delivering the most capable, useful mobile robots\nsolving the toughest challenges in industry today: with Spot, with Stretch,\nand now with Atlas.\n\nA decade ago, we were one of the only companies putting real R&D effort into\nhumanoid robots. Now the landscape in the robotics industry is very different.\nOur customers have seen success with Spot and Stretch and they are eager to\ntackle the next challenge with Atlas. Given our track record of successful\ncommercialization, we are confident in our plan to not just create an\nimpressive R&D project, but to deliver a valuable solution.\n\nThis journey will start with Hyundai\u2014in addition to investing in us, the\nHyundai team is building the next generation of automotive manufacturing\ncapabilities, and it will serve as a perfect testing ground for new Atlas\napplications. In the months and years ahead, we\u2019re excited to show what the\nworld\u2019s most dynamic humanoid robot can really do\u2014in the lab, in the factory,\nand in our lives.\n\n0:31\n\n## The Journey with Atlas\n\nHaving a meaningful impact outside of the lab requires collaboration beyond\nour walls. Following the commercial deployment of both Spot and Stretch, we\nknow how to deliver real value for customers. Similar to our Stretch rollout,\nwe will be partnering with a small group of innovative customers, beginning\nwith Hyundai, to test and iterate Atlas applications over the next few years.\nThis is the first look at a real product, but it certainly isn\u2019t the last.\n\nThe electric version of Atlas will be stronger, with a broader range of motion\nthan any of our previous generations. For example, our last generation\nhydraulic Atlas (HD Atlas) could already lift and maneuver a wide variety of\nheavy, irregular objects; we are continuing to build on those existing\ncapabilities and are exploring several new gripper variations to meet a\ndiverse set of expected manipulation needs in customer environments.\n\n1:38\n\nMoreover, a capable robot is only one of the pieces required for a successful\ncommercial solution. Scaled autonomous mobile robot deployments are part of\nthe broader digital transformation ecosystem, requiring IT infrastructure,\nemployee buy-in, connectivity, workflows, safety standards, and operational\nprocesses for the robots and the data they generate and rely on. With over\n1,500 deployments, Spot is already teaching hundreds of companies how to work\nalongside autonomous mobile robots. We believe that humanoids will be most\neffective if they are deployed with in-depth models of a facility and lots and\nlots of data about how it operates. You can start creating these types of\ndigital twins with Spot today, using Spot, Stretch, and Boston Dynamics to\nfacilitate this operational sea change for your organization.\n\nAnd we are not just delivering industry-leading hardware. Some of our most\nexciting progress over the past couple of years has been in software. In\naddition to our decades of expertise in simulation and model predictive\ncontrol, we have equipped our robots with new AI and machine learning tools,\nlike reinforcement learning and computer vision to ensure they can operate and\nadapt efficiently to complex real-world situations.\n\nWe also recently launched our OrbitTM software, which provides a centralized\nplatform to manage your entire robot fleet, site maps, and digital\ntransformation data. Today it\u2019s available for Spot, but Stretch and Atlas will\nalso be integrated into this enterprise solution. With a robust team of ML\nexperts shaping our products, we are prepared to bring impactful AI to market\nimmediately\u2014we\u2019ve already started with Spot, and it will get even better and\nfaster with Atlas.\n\n## The Role of a Humanoid Robot\n\nThis latest iteration of the Atlas robot builds on a long history of\ninnovation and R&D pushing the limits of whole-body mobility and bimanual\nmanipulation. From PETMAN testing protective clothing to the recently retired\nHD Atlas performing parkour, we have spent over a decade moving the state of\nthe art forward with humanoid robotics.\n\nTraditionally, we have focused on legged robots because we wanted to build\nrobots that could balance and move dynamically\u2014robots that could navigate\nunstructured, unknown, or antagonistic terrain with ease. The humanoid form\nfactor is a useful design for robots working in a world designed for people.\n\nHowever, that form factor doesn\u2019t limit our vision of how a bipedal robot can\nmove, what tools it needs to succeed, and how it can help people accomplish\nmore. We designed the electric version of Atlas to be stronger, more\ndexterous, and more agile. Atlas may resemble a human form factor, but we are\nequipping the robot to move in the most efficient way possible to complete a\ntask, rather than being constrained by a human range of motion. Atlas will\nmove in ways that exceed human capabilities. Combining decades of practical\nexperience with first principles thinking, we are confident in our ability to\ndeliver a robot uniquely capable of tackling dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks\nin real applications.\n\nCommercialization takes great engineering, but it also takes patience,\nimagination, and collaboration. Boston Dynamics has proven that we can deliver\nthe full package with both industry-leading robotics and a complete ecosystem\nof software, services, and support to make robotics useful in the real world.\n\nShare on Social\n\nRecent Blogs\n\n  * Trends in Robotics\n\n8 min read\n\nEmbracing Change with Agile Mobile Robots\n\n  * Safety\n\n7 min read\n\nSpot to the Rescue\n\n  * Innovation\n\n9 min read\n\nStarting on the Right Foot with Reinforcement Learning\n\n###### Subscribe for More Insights\n\n## Featured Resources\n\nView All Resources\n\nInspection\n\nWebinar\n\n\u202245 min watch\n\nStarting Strong: How to Deploy Mobile Robots for Industrial Inspection\n\nInnovation\n\nBlog\n\n\u20229 min read\n\nPicking Up Momentum\n\nWarehouse Robotics\n\nBlog\n\n\u20225 min read\n\nWhat Does It Take to Get a Robot into the Field?\n\nNAVIGATION\n\nHELPFUL LINKS\n\nRESOURCES\n\n\u00a92023 Boston Dynamics.
