(October 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)  \n---  \n  \nIn software design, web design, and electronic product design, synthetic\nmonitoring (also known as active monitoring or proactive monitoring) is a\nmonitoring technique that is done by using a simulation or scripted recordings\nof transactions. Behavioral scripts (or paths) are created to simulate an\naction or path that a customer or end user would take on a site, application,\nor other software (or even hardware). Those paths are then continuously\nmonitored at specified intervals for performance, such as functionality,\navailability, and response time measures.\n\nSynthetic monitoring enables a webmaster or an IT/Operations professional to\nidentify problems and determine if a website or application is slow or\nexperiencing downtime before that problem affects actual end users or\ncustomers. This type of monitoring does not require actual traffic, thus the\nname synthetic, so it enables companies to test applications 24x7, or test new\napplications prior to a live customer-facing launch.^[1]^[2]\n\nBecause synthetic monitoring is a simulation of typical user behavior or\nnavigation through a website, it is often best used to monitor commonly\ntrafficked paths and critical business processes. Synthetic tests must be\nscripted in advance, so it is not feasible to measure performance for every\npermutation of a navigational path an end user might take. This is more suited\nfor passive monitoring.\n\nSynthetic testing is useful for measuring uptime, availability, and response\ntime of critical pages and transactions (how a site performs from all\ngeographies) but doesn't monitor or capture actual end user interactions, see\nWebsite monitoring.^[3]\n\nSynthetic monitoring will report myriad metrics, and it's up to the a\nwebmaster or an IT/Operations professional to identify which ones are most\nimportant. Common metrics from synthetic website monitoring includes Time to\nFirst Byte, Speed Index, Time to Interactive, and Page Complete.^[4]\n\nDemand for synthetic monitoring has grown exponentially corresponding to the\nunderlying growth in websites/applications. IT/Operations staff need\nmechanisms to identify health and performance issues in advance of their\ncustomers identifying and reporting them to avoid customer satisfaction\nissues. To accomplish this they can write custom simulation scripts, or\nleverage the growing number of commercial synthetic monitoring solutions.\nExample include:\n\n  * New Relic's Synthetics\n  * F5's Distributed Cloud Synthetic Monitoring\n  * Data Dog's Automated Synthetic Monitoring\n  * Powerhouse Nudge Synthetic Monitoring by Atakama Technologies\n\nBy implementing Synthetic Monitoring IT/Operations staffs are able to identify\napplication issues in advance of them becoming critical, and take remedial\naction. Identifying such issues can be difficult because of:\n\n  * The number of applications monitored by an average sized organization can be several hundred\n  * Issues may vary by geography; for example performance issues may be evident to users in Asia, but may not appear to users in Europe\n  * IT/Operations staff need not only to identify the fact that an issue exists, but also need diagnostic information on what is causing the identified issue\n  * IT/Operations staff often lack the historical perspective on application performance which can be helpful in diagnosing an evolving issue\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Application performance management\n  * Website monitoring\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Prioritizing Gartner's APM Model\".
