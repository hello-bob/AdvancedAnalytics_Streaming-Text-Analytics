Credit:\nPBWPIX/Alamy\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has changed how it classifies pathogens\nthat spread through the air, such as SARS-CoV-2. The redefinition has been two\nyears in the making and comes after criticism that during the COVID-19\npandemic, the WHO was too slow to acknowledge that COVID was airborne. The\nchange aims to provide clarity during pandemics, but some researchers are not\nconvinced.\n\nVirologists now acknowledge that SARS-CoV-2 spreads mostly by airborne\ntransmission of small particles that are inhaled and that can remain in the\nair for hours \u2014 a method that was previously called \u2018aerosol\u2019 transmission. It\nalso spreads by larger \u2018droplets\u2019 of virus-containing particles on surfaces,\nincluding hands, or ejected over short distances.\n\nWhy the WHO took two years to say COVID is airborne\n\nHowever WHO didn\u2019t publicly acknowledge the importance of airborne\ntransmission until October 2020, a decision that outgoing chief scientist\nSoumya Swaminathan said in November 2022 said should have been made much\nearlier based on the available evidence. It didn\u2019t amend its official document\non COVID-19 transmission to include airborne transmission until December 2021.\nAs a result, early infection control and prevention advice focused mainly on\nsurface cleaning, hand-washing and social distancing, rather than mask-wearing\nand improved ventilation.\n\nSome researchers say earlier recognition of airborne transmission by the WHO\ncould have saved lives, noting mounting evidence that pointed to airborne\ntransmission before its official acknowledgement.\n\n## Technical report\n\nTo clarify the distinction between airborne, droplet and aerosol, the WHO\nreleased a technical report on 18 April after more than two years of\nconsultation with more than 100 experts from a range of scientific\ndisciplines. The report does away with the division between \u2018droplets\u2019 and\n\u2018aerosols\u2019 used during the pandemic to distinguish between particles above or\nbelow five micrometres in diameter. Instead, it proposes the term \u2018infectious\nrespiratory particles\u2019 to describe all such particles, regardless of size.\n\nHowever the report still shies away from describing all pathogens that spread\nthrough the air as \u2018airborne\u2019. Instead, the document uses the umbrella term\n\u2018through the air\u2019 to describe any mode of transmission that \u201cinvolves the\npathogen travelling through or being suspended in the air\u201d. That is then\nfurther broken down into two categories: \u2018airborne transmission/inhalation\u2019 is\nwhen infectious respiratory particles are inhaled from the air into the\nrespiratory tract; while \u2018direct deposition\u2019 is when those particles travel\nover short range to land directly on the mouth, nose or eyes of another\nperson.\n\nUnder this terminology, COVID-19 would be recognized as spreading through the\nair by airborne/inhalation transmission, with a much smaller risk of\ntransmission by direct deposition.\n\n## Up in the air\n\nIt\u2019s a mixed result for many scientists. \u201cThe positive thing which I see of\nthis report is the fact that the report removes this division of five\nmicrometres between aerosols and droplets,\u201d says Lidia Morawska, an aerosol\nscientist at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia.\nThat distinction was the justification for emphasis on hand-washing,\ndistancing and surface-cleaning, rather than mask-wearing and ventilation \u2014 a\ndistinction Morawska says was unscientific. It was also the distinction that\njustified WHO\u2019s March 2020 assertion that COVID-19 was not airborne.\n\nBut that achievement of the report has been tarnished for some by the\nclassification of \u2018through the air\u2019, instead of airborne.\n\n\u201cThe simplest and clearest way to describe it is to call it airborne\ntransmission,\u201d says Linsey Marr, environmental engineer at Virginia Tech in\nBlacksburg, United States, whose research focuses on the transmission of\ninfectious disease via aerosols and who was involved in the report. \u201cWe talk\nabout waterborne transmission, blood-borne transmission, vector-borne\ntransmission; it seems very logical and simple to me that we would call this\nairborne transmission.\u201d\n\nWHO Chief Scientist Jeremy Farrar says \u2018through the air\u2019 allows for\nrecognition of both airborne transmission in which infectious respiratory\nparticles are inhaled, and the less common transmission via direct deposition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a dichotomy of mutually exclusive transmission routes,\u201d he says. The\nrecognition of both \u2018airborne\u2019 and \u2018direct deposition\u2019 under the umbrella of\n\u2018through the air\u2019 avoided going back to the divide between aerosols and\ndroplets, Farrar says. \u2018Through the air\u2019 is comparable with vector-borne and\nwaterborne, he says, but acknowledges that \u201cthere is a direct deposition\nelement, even if that is not the major way it transmits.\u201d\n\nJulian Tang, a clinical virologist at the University of Leicester, UK, who was\nalso involved with the report, says there was vigorous debate among experts\nabout the term airborne and what it conveys. Some of the scientists on the\nteam that prepared the report argued that it would be problematic to use\n\u2018airborne\u2019 for all pathogens that spread through the air. \u201cThey think it\u2019s too\nscary, too frightening, has too many connotations and it will cause panic, so\nthey chose \u2018through the air\u2019,\u201d Tang says.\n\nFarrar says he has no reticence to use the term \u2018airborne\u2019. He stresses that\nthis technical report is merely the \u2018base camp\u2019 of an ongoing process to\nrefine terminology and its practical applications. \u201cI'm not saying everybody\nis happy, and not everybody agrees on every word in the document, but at least\npeople have agreed this is a baseline terminology.\u201d\n\nBut Morawska, who also consulted on the report, argues that division between\nairborne and direct deposition is not justified. \u201cIt is just confusing the\nissues,\u201d she says.\n\nEven the co-chair of the group that developed the document, environmental\nengineer Yuguo Li from the University of Hong Kong, says he prefers the term\n\u2018airborne\u2019 to \u2018through the air\u2019. However, he says what\u2019s important is how the\nconcept is applied in practice. \u201cIn theory, airborne is a perfect umbrella\nterm as waterborne and vector-borne, but it means different things to\ndifferent people,\u201d Li says. \u201cThe issue is not only about terminologies, it\u2019s\nabout the need to work with public health experts, medical experts to\nunderstand those responses.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 rarely spreads through surfaces. So why are we still deep cleaning?\n\nTang says the document sets an important benchmark for how the world responds\nto the next pandemic. \u201cThe next pandemic will most likely be a respiratory\nvirus again because that\u2019s normally the pathogen that mutates the fastest,\u201d he\nsays. The report\u2019s clarity around transmission will help public health\nproviders to respond appropriately. \u201cThey will then consider masking early,\nthey\u2019ll consider ventilation early, they\u2019ll consider all these precautions\nearly because a precedent has been set already.\u201d\n\nThe report notes that measures to address through-the-air transmission must\ntake into account both the risk posed by the infection itself \u2014 for example,\ndisease severity \u2014 and the resources available, which may be limited in low or\nmiddle-income countries.\n\nFarrar believes this new definition could save lives in future pandemics.\n\u201cWhat's needed now is moving on from base camp to now understanding actually,\nthe non-pharmacological interventions that really matter, and if they work,\nand the evidence of it.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01173-7\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * WHO declares end to COVID-19\u2019s emergency phase\n\n  * How much virus does a person with COVID exhale?
