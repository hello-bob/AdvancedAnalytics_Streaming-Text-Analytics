As I recall, it was pretty magical. I can...\n\nListen now\n\n13 days ago \u00b7 2 likes \u00b7 Stephen Moore\n\nI barely use it. There are only a handful of sites I read, a small number of\nwebsites I use, and a few platforms I am logged into. And each year, that\nnumber dwindles further.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to begin. A post on Reddit by jalousiee is a good\nstarting point;\n\n> \u201cThe Internet these days just feels like we\u2019ve been relegated to a\n> McDonald\u2019s play place. You have to sit in the sticky, plastic chairs that\n> everyone else has sat in while you eat your shitty double cheeseburger. It\u2019s\n> hot, it\u2019s stuffy, it\u2019s gross, and you want to leave but you can\u2019t because\n> all your friends seem perfectly fine putting up with this dogshit. And\n> because you don\u2019t want to become a social pariah, you have to sit there too\n> and pretend like you\u2019re okay with it.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s tear down this shitty new internet.\n\n###\n\nMy dislike of the current internet is multifaceted\n\nThe internet is polluted with ads of every form, type and size \u2014 popups,\nbanners, baked-in ads on videos, sponsored posts \u2014 and they are now invasive\nto the point they have harmed the internet experience. They are everywhere.\nWorse, we\u2019re tracked around the internet (thank you cookies) in an attempt to\nmake these ads more \u2018relevant\u2019; instead, they\u2019re just creepy and have\nconvinced huge swathes of the internet-using population that their computers\nare listening to them. No ad is a good ad, and while it\u2019s been an acceptable\npayoff to use the internet, the reward is no longer worth the infuriation it\ncauses. Even ad blockers, which have been my saving grace for years, are now\nstruggling to free me from the clutter.\n\nThanks in part to these ads, most websites are bordering on unusable. The\nfirst whiff of money, and everyone got greedy. Click off an advert here, only\nto have a new one pop up as you scroll. Huge areas of white space that are\nreally video ads struggling to load. Then, a chatbot pops up to ask if you\nneed help (and if you engage with them, the advice is the opposite of\nhelpful). The popup windows offering you shitty PDF guides in return for your\nemail address. Then, there is a post that is just a disguised sponsored post.\nPages stuffed with affiliate links (DON\u2019T GET ME STARTED ON RECIPE WEB PAGES.)\nOr the pay-gating, which has made most news and media websites barely\nfunctional and is becoming more aggressive in a desperate attempt to keep\nthese businesses alive. As someone who writes on tech and business, I can only\nread a small percentage of websites now (and I can\u2019t afford to subscribe to\nthem all).\n\nThen there is search, a once glorious feature that allowed us to find almost\nany information, video or image we could think up with the typing of a few\nwords. The top of Google results back then had authority and trust. And for a\nwhile, it was glorious. Then came SEO gurus, growth-hacking, and paying for\npositions. Then Google itself started playing dirty tricks or manipulating\nsearch results, and the whole thing has become a shit show\u2014Google\u2019s\nmonopolistic powers over what is seen and what isn\u2019t have resulted in lower-\nquality search results. Search sucks so bad that people now think asking an\nA.I. chatbot questions (which just pulls info from the same website anyways)\nis a better alternative. Says it all.\n\nOne of the most damaging shifts is the move to engagement as the priority\nmetric. This came with the rise of social media, also known as Web 2.0. Forget\nthe quality of content, accessibility, site design or speed/ease of use.\nEverything is about views and clicks \u2014 the attention economy mind rot. It has\nresulted in the explosion of clickbait, hate bait, engagement bait and endless\nforms of awful, copy-and-paste content designed to \u201chack\u201d growth. Every forum\nor tweet or social post, or comment section is filled with hate, sexism,\nextreme political views, OnlyFans porn previews, triggering replies and more,\nall for the sake of views. Everything is systematically designed and curated\nto generate anger, tribalism and polarization. Whatever it takes to get your\neyeballs fixed on that screen, it\u2019s fair game. The tech industry turned the\ninternet into a dopamine machine, and they are doing everything they can to\nget you hooked on the nasty shit.\n\nWorse, a lot of the drivel isn\u2019t even produced by humans. As the internet\nexpanded, so did the realization that it could be farmed for engagement. Enter\nthe bots. Some platforms (looking at your Twitter X) have been destroyed by\nbots. P U S S Y I N B I O. But these bots do more than slide into your DMs or\nrespond with the same auto-generated nonsense. They also work in tandem to\ndeploy campaigns of disinformation. And as we saw with the elections, this is\nscarily effective, especially on the older generations who still don\u2019t\nunderstand that everything you see online isn\u2019t real. Really, it\u2019s time that\npenny dropped.\n\nWeb 2.0 also brought us algorithms, which has led to what I like to call the\nvanilla internet. Why try anything else when you can get the same shit fed to\nyou day in and day out? Algorithms have been so well designed and executed\n(think TikTok) that they\u2019ve removed the need to explore. They\u2019ve taken away\nthe desire to widen horizons. That\u2019s where the curiosity drained away. It\u2019s\nall paint by numbers (and we\u2019re the numbers). These algorithms have infested\nevery platform and have forced us to become more insular and develop tunnel\nvision. We\u2019ve seen the polarizing consequences of this time and time again.\n\nMore recently, we\u2019ve found ourselves on the cusp of another big shift, perhaps\neven another age of the internet \u2014 the era of A.I. generated sludge. Every\nplatform, every comment section, every social post and now many reputable (or\nformerly so) media sites are filled with A.I.-generated content, responses and\nreplies. Social sites are polluted with A.I.-generated images that the\nuntrained eyes (read: social users aged 40 and above) cannot tell are fake,\ngenerating ungodly volumes of clicks. Not only is the internet harder to\nnavigate now, it\u2019s harder to tell what is real and what isn\u2019t. The way A.I.\nhas been implemented to date shows the suckiness of the internet is only going\nto get worse. A lot worse. It will amplify every one of these problems.\n\nShare\n\n###\n\nPerhaps this was all inevitable\n\nThe internet is still a relatively new technology in the context of time, and\nit may only have been a more blissful place in those early years because\npeople hadn\u2019t clocked on to how it could be monetized, farmed, controlled or\nbent to their will.\n\nAlas, we are where we are \u2014 on the verge of ruining it completely.\n\nThe question is where to point the blame. That\u2019s a hard one to answer. As the\nusers of the internet, we\u2019re all accountable for how we use it, what services\nwe use, and what models we are happy to engage with. If you learn that\nFacebook was stealing your data to sell to Big Advertising, and you still use\nthe platform, you\u2019re complicit. If you hate that Google isn\u2019t playing fair\nwith search but still use Google, you\u2019re complicit (I\u2019m guilty of this one).\nIf you hate that media sites have adopted A.I. to turn out sludge, and you\nstill read them, you\u2019re complicit.\n\nBut a lot of blame also falls on tech overlords and venture capitalists, who\nhave been destroying the experience in the pursuit of turning it into an\nattention-farming system because, as we all now know, clicks drive advertiser\nmoney. Venture capitalist money and its control over media, platforms, and\nsocial companies have forced them to design not for customer value but for\nshareholder value. Every update, every pivot, every decision is made to drive\nthat line higher.\n\nI wish I could end this on a more positive note.\n\nI thought about offering solutions, but I don\u2019t have any. The internet is\ncontrolled by a handful of monopolies, which are resistant to change because\nchange lowers their stock price. Many users are resistant, too; either they\ndon\u2019t care that it got shitty or they are in too deep and have accepted it for\nit is. Those who have sold their souls to plunder the internet for a living\nwith shitty courses and growth-hacking guides certainly don\u2019t care. Scariest\nof all, many of us are addicted and don\u2019t even come to the internet for joy,\nknowledge or connection anymore\u2014 we just do it because we are 100% wired into\nthe machine and can\u2019t break the cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty bleak.\n\nWhat we need is a giant reset and a chance to start over.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that will come anytime soon.\n\n###\n\nOn the Trend Mill this week\n\n  * Sam Bankman-Not-Freed \u2014 Big news came last week, with the disgraced founder of the FTX crypto exchange and the Alameda Research trading firm sentenced to a 25-year prison sentence for his role in the collapse of the company, which led to billions of investor money being burned. But the industry is doomed to repeat the same mistakes. As crypto critic Molly White writes, \u201cThere have been no changes that would prevent a new crypto mania just as devastating as the last.\u201d\n\n  * Reddit and weep\u2014 On March 21, Reddit finally went public. Within a matter of days, shares plunged over 25%, and it was revealed that the CEO had been cashing out, with Steve Huffman selling $16 million of stock. While it\u2019s fair enough the founder is selling (he\u2019s been holding these stocks a long time), it never sends a strong market signal. It often does the opposite. Is it a case of \u2018get out while you can?\u2019\n\n  * Apple now developing AR/VR AppleCar home robots \u2014 Apple has teams investigating a push into personal robotics, which the company believes has the potential to become one its \u201cnext big things.\u201d It sounds a little dumb to me, but, as someone who is desperate to see the company get back to innovating and less about following industry trends, who knows. Maybe this could be that spark.\n\nIf you enjoyed this edition of Trend Mill, subscribe for weekly takes and\naudio editions of the newsletter (as read by me)\n\n69 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n18 Restacks\n\n69\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I Kinda Hate The Internet Now\n\nwww.trend-mill.com\n\n33\n\nShare\n\n33 Comments\n\nKaren SmileyAgile Analytics and BeyondApr 6Liked by Stephen MooreA lot of this\nresonates, Stephen.

My\nsolution to this problem so far is to avoid everything that is closely related\nto tech giants, or at least what I consider better alternatives:\\- I use\nFirefox\\- I use Perplexity and DuckDuckGo for search\\- AdBlock and uBlock are\nboth installed, as well a uBlacklist\\- And I switched all my email and\ncalendar away from Google\\- I never had a FB account, and deleted Twitter 2\ndays ago\\- I pay for Youtube Premium, it's a life saver.Honestly, I rarely see\nan ads. The only ads are the \"sponsors\". I also have many other things to do\nin my life than consulting the media, or news. One has to be careful what they\nput in their mind and have the will to break free from the addiction.For some\nof these, I literally see zero reason not to switch. Like using Firefox isn't\ngoing to change anything in someone's life, and DuckDuckGo actually still\nprovide relevant responses, and no ads.Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n3 replies by Stephen Moore and others\n\n31 more comments...\n\nSelling Our Souls for A.I.
