Paterson, ETH Zurich\n\n##### Abstract\n\nNextcloud is a leading cloud storage platform with more than 20 million users.\nNextcloud offers an end-to-end encryption (E2EE) feature that is claimed to be\nable \u201cto keep extremely sensitive data fully secure even in case of a full\nserver breach\u201d. They also claim that the Nextcloud server \u201chas Zero Knowledge,\nthat is, never has access to any of the data or keys in unencrypted form\u201d.\nThis is achieved by having encryption and decryption operations that are done\nusing file keys that are only available to Nextcloud clients, with those file\nkeys being protected by a key hierarchy that ultimately relies on long\npassphrases known exclusively to the users. We provide the first detailed\ndocumentation and security analysis of Nextcloud's E2EE feature. Nextcloud's\nstrong security claims motivate conducting the analysis in the setting where\nthe server itself is considered malicious. We present three distinct attacks\nagainst the E2EE security guarantees in this setting. Each one enables the\nconfidentiality and integrity of all user files to be compromised. All three\nattacks are fully practical and we have built proof-of-concept implementations\nfor each. The vulnerabilities make it trivial for a malicious Nextcloud server\nto access and manipulate users' data. We have responsibly disclosed the three\nvulnerabilities to Nextcloud. The second and third vulnerabilities have been\nremediated. The first was addressed by temporarily disabling file sharing from\nthe E2EE feature until a redesign of the feature can be made. We reflect on\nbroader lessons that can be learned for designers of E2EE systems.\n\n##### Metadata\n\nAvailable format(s)\n\n    PDF\nCategory\n\n    Attacks and cryptanalysis\nPublication info\n\n    Published elsewhere. 9th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy, Euro S&P 2024\nKeywords\n\n    Real-world cryptographyEnd-to-end encryptionAttacksCloud storageNextcloud\nContact author(s)\n\n    martinralbrecht @ googlemail com mbackendal @ inf ethz ch daniele coppola @ inf ethz ch kenny paterson @ inf ethz ch\nHistory\n\n    2024-04-10: approved\n    2024-04-08: received\n    See all versions\nShort URL\n\n    https://ia.cr/2024/546\nLicense\n\n    CC BY\n\nBibTeX\n\n    \n    \n    @misc{cryptoeprint:2024/546, author = {Martin R.
