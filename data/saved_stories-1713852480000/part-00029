However, mosquitoes have become\nincreasingly resistant to the chemical.\n\nDuring clinical trials when a net was coated with the insecticides\npyriproxyfen or chlorfenapyr, alongside pyrethroid, malaria transmissions were\nreduced by between 20% and 50%.\n\nTomnjong, a father of two, puts up a dual insecticide-treated mosquito net in\nhis home in Cameroon.

The organisation expects the rollout of the new\nproduct will continue at scale in the 17 states that took part in the pilot\nand will further expand to other countries.\n\nWorld first: malaria vaccine rollout begins in Cameroon\n\nRead more\n\nThe Global Fund is providing the new nets for under $3 (\u00a32.40), which it says\nis comparable to the cost of older products. The organisation estimates that\ncountries could save up to $30m (\u00a324m) by adopting the new nets.\n\nIn January, the rollout of the first malaria vaccine began in Cameroon.\nAnother 19 African countries are expected to introduce the RTS,S vaccine this\nyear, including Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which took part in the\nbed net trials.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Global development\n  * Fair Access\n  * Malaria\n  * Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria\n  * Africa\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
