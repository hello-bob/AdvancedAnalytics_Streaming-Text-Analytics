Bowers College of Computing and Information Science\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nFacebookTwitterEmailShare\n\nIt takes a village to nurture social robots.\n\nResearchers who develop social robots \u2013 ones that people interact with \u2013 focus\ntoo much on design features and not enough on sociological factors, like\nhuman-to-human interactions, the contexts where they happen and cultural norms\ninvolving robots, according to an award-winning paper from Cornell and Indiana\nUniversity scholars who specialize in human-robot interaction.\n\n\u201cIf we want to understand what makes a robot social, we have to look at the\nbroader scope of the communities around robots and people\u2019s interactions with\neach other,\u201d said Malte Jung, co-author and associate professor of information\nscience in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information\nScience and the Nancy H. \u201962 and Philip M. \u201962 Young Sesquicentennial Faculty\nFellow. \u201cSociality is constructed through interactions people have with each\nother around the machine. It\u2019s not just about programming a better character\nfor the robot, making it respond better to human social features, making it\nlook cuter or behaving more naturally.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s paper, \u201cConstructing a Social Life with Robots: Shifting Away From\nDesign Patterns Towards Interaction Ritual Chains,\u201d won Best Paper at the\nHuman-Robot Interaction conference, which was held March 11-14 in Boulder,\nColorado. The research was based on field work by Waki Kamino, a doctoral\nstudent in the field of information science and the paper\u2019s lead author, who\nspent months immersed in Tokyo\u2019s robot-friendly culture.\n\nIn Tokyo, social robots offer owners the opportunity to interact with each\nother and have fun, Kamino said. Three social robots in particular \u2013 Sony\u2019s\naibo, SHARP\u2019s RoBoHoN, and Groove X\u2019s LOVOT \u2013 each have expansive communities\nof like-minded owners who regularly meet up and host social events involving\nthe robots. Owners have \u201cadded robots into their social rituals,\u201d Kamino said.\nThey meet up for coffee or throw birthday parties for their robots.\n\n\u201cThese people are sometimes portrayed as isolated, eccentric or lonely but in\nfact have rich friend connections,\u201d she said, \u201cand sometimes these connections\nare facilitated by robots.\u201d\n\nKamino visited homes, robot stores, caf\u00e9s and conventions, and interviewed\npeople about their robot-accompanied lifestyles. Her work informed one of the\npaper\u2019s primary findings: In Japan, manufacturers and robot owners together\nhelped establish new norms for robots as social agents. Companies incorporated\nfamiliar designs into their robots and brought owners together by hosting\nsponsored events, while owners made their robots part of everyday interactions\nwith friends and met up regularly in public spaces, robots in tow.\n\nRobots also provide emotional support, Kamino found.\n\nIn interviews, she heard from a couple that chose a robot over a living pet\nbecause there was less \u201cemotional risk\u201d and even planned for their robot\u2019s\nfuture care when the couple died. Kamino learned another family\u2019s robot was\noften their late mother\u2019s only companion while she was hospitalized during the\npandemic.\n\nThe research team calls on the field of human-robot interaction (HRI) to\nconsider a broader sociological view when designing and building robot\ncompanions.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, HRI research has always looked at just this one interaction\nbetween one person and one robot,\u201d Jung said. \u201cWe really have to look at the\nbroader scope of the communities around people's interactions with each other\nand take all of this into consideration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaki\u2019s research shows that using robots doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re isolating\nyourself with the robot,\u201d said Selma \u0160abanovi\u0107, professor in the Luddy School\nof Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University and a paper\nco-author. \u201cInteracting with robots is actually a social practice that you do\ntogether with others.\u201d\n\nLouis DiPietro is a writer for the Cornell Ann S.
