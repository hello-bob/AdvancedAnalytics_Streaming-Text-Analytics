The resulting images give an ultra high\nresolution glimpse into the brain, which will help us better understand the\nnature of consciousness and treat neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nDeveloped by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission\n(CEA), the Iseult MRI machine packs a magnetic field strength of 11.7 Teslas\n(T). By comparison, conventional MRI machines in wide use in hospitals today\nare usually 1.5 or at most 3 T.\n\nMore Stories\n\nScience\n\n19,000-year-old biosphere with links to Mars discovered beneath desert\n\nMedical\n\nAnti-aging biopharma company raises $40 million to begin human tests\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nI consent to the use of Google Analytics and related cookies across the\nTrendMD network (widget, website, blog).

In just four minutes, Iseult can capture\nimages down to 0.2 mm (0.008 in) of brain tissue horizontally, in 'slices'\njust 1-mm (0.04-in) thick. That volume is the equivalent of a few thousand\nneurons at a time.\n\nFor conventional MRI machines to take images of this resolution, patients\nwould need to lie perfectly still for more than two hours \u2013 the slightest\nmovement would blur the shot. That of course just isn\u2019t feasible.\n\nAlso boosting comfort is the 90-cm (35.4-in) wide 'hole' for patients to stick\ntheir heads in. That might not seem like a huge increase over the usual\n60-to-70 cm (23.6-to-27.6 in), but the extra headroom can help make the\nexperience less claustrophobic.\n\nComparison images of the human brain captured with the new Iseult MRI machine\nat different power levels \u2013 3 Teslas (T), 7 T and 11.7 T.

The stunning images\ndemonstrate the potential for the new MRI technology to reveal previously\nunattainable information about how the brain works, including how it encodes\nmental representations, and which neuronal signatures are associated with\nconsciousness itself.\n\nBesides those existential questions, Iseult should also help scientists\nunderstand, diagnose and treat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and\nParkinson\u2019s. It should be able to detect chemical signatures that are usually\ntoo weak to be seen with regular MRI scans, including molecules like glucose\nand glutamate, which are involved in brain metabolism and disorders of which\ncan be involved in conditions like gliomas and neurodegeneration. It will also\nbe able to track the distribution of lithium in the brain, which is used to\ntreat bipolar disorders.\n\nThanks to its complexity, Iseult is far larger than other MRI machines. It\nmeasures 5 m (16.4 ft) long and wide, weighs 132 tons and is made with 182 km\n(113 miles) of superconducting wires. To keep the magnets cooled to the\nrequired -271.35 \u00b0C (-456.43 \u00b0F) takes some 7,500 liters (1,981 gallons) of\nliquid helium. That size, complexity and no doubt cost might limit where the\nIseult MRI machine can be used, but hopefully it will be beneficial enough to\ngo into service in some specialty facilities soon.\n\nThe team discusses the tech in the video below.\n\nA world premiere: the brain revealed as never before thanks to the world\u2019s\nmost powerful MRI machine\n\nSource: CEA\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.

It is not restricted to specimens, small animals or small human parts.\nThe Ontario system has a bore diameter of 11 cm. The Iseult MRI system has a\nbore diameter of 60 cm.\n\nThe Iseult project started in 2004, the design was mostly complete by 2010,\nwith construction starting in 2013, installation taking place during 2017, the\nmachine reached full magnetic field strength in 2019, and commissioning took\nuntil 2023 before the system was ready for scientific use.\n\nBecause building this huge machine has been a 20 year endeavour, the\ntechnology has moved on during the development. In particular, this system\nuses conventional niobium-titanium alloy low temperature superconductor (LTS)\nwith immersion cooling in liquid helium. This necessitates a very large\ncryostat (5m diameter x 5m length, 132 tonne weight), as well as approximately\n1000 kg of liquid helium.\n\nLTS technology has the advantage of being well understood, with considerable\nindustrial experience. However, high temperature superconductors are\ncommercially available, with solutions available to some of the major\ndifficulties of building magnets with these materials (e.g. wire joints have\nproven extremely difficult with HTS conductors).\n\nRadboud University in the Netherlands, has recently commenced a project to\nbuild a 14 T whole body MRI system using HTS technology. The Radboud machine\nis expected to be 1.5m in diameter, 2m long and weigh 15 tonnes, and use \"dry\"\ncooling (no liquid helium).\n\nasninsp April 3, 2024 06:50 PM\n\n\"which will help us better understand the nature of consciousness\" .. this is\njust plain stupid.\n\nThe brain is physical and consciousness is meta-physical.\n\nThere isn't a scientist alive that can prove how consciousness arises from\nmolecules that comprise cells that make up brain tissue.\n\nRead \"Irreduicable Mind\".\n\nRick O April 5, 2024 08:12 AM\n\nDealing with Cryogenic vacuum pumps fairly regularly, the amount of LIQUID\nHelium stated here just blows my mind. How do they keep it liquid in such a\nhigh volume? That would be insanely dangerous as well. Most cryogenic systems\nusing helium use a closed gas loop that runs like a refrigerator. Compressed\nhigh pressure gas, then expanded to create the cooling effect in the proper\nlocation. If you ever get an MRI, you'll hear the cryo head pulsing like a\nsteady, non stop \"pshh pshh pshh pshh\" sound. As far as I'm aware it's not in\na liquid state in current machines.\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
