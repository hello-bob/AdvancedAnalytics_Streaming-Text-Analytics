From blog\ncomments to HackerNews threads to full blown heavyweight throwdowns on Reddit.\n\nI saw a huge divide and some interesting insights between people who think\nthey are a game changer and people who think they are nothing but a glorified\nform of basic common sense metrics that don\u2019t deserve the pedestal they\u2019ve\nbeen put on.\n\nWell, I\u2019m your chef today and my job is to create a beautiful DORA dish for\nyou that lets you taste the sweet and savory of this heavy debate.\n\nNow, you probably can guess already what side we are on, right?\n\nI will take you through all the points from DORA haters out there and also\ntouch on how to mitigate these.\n\n## The Illusion of Precision\n\nOn the surface, the appeal of DORA is clear: hard data to measure the\nperformance of something as notoriously difficult to quantify as software\ndelivery.\n\n\u201cThis reductionist approach obscures the nuances and often unpredictable\ndynamics of the software delivery pipeline\u201d\n\nGreat point, however here is our question: Why do you think DORA metrics\nencompass everything? They don\u2019t claim to do so, right?\n\nI'll highlight a few points being made further in the article.\n\n### Success Is Not Just Release Counts\n\nYes, frequent deployments can be a good sign, but what if those constant\nchanges are filled with bugs or frustrating user experience regressions? User\nsatisfaction and the actual impact of new features are absent from standard\nDORA calculations.\n\n### DORA Metrics Ignore Complexity\n\nDORA doesn't differentiate between a minor CSS fix and a complex refactor of\ncore architecture. This makes it difficult to compare teams, and can create\nincentives to avoid those necessary-but-risky projects for the sake of short-\nterm metrics.\n\n### Are Metrics the Goal?\n\nA common point across multiple Reddit discussions I found is \u201cIt\u2019s easy to\ngame these metrics, especially in a distributed large org\u201d\n\nFocusing just on hitting DORA targets can lead to devs taking shortcuts. Devs\nmay split tasks into artificially small pieces for deployment padding, or skip\nthorough testing to reduce lead times. It's gaming the system that ultimately\nsacrifices software quality for the illusion of progress.\n\n### Solution\n\n  1. DORA metrics are not everything, so just relying on the 4 DORA metrics doesn\u2019t cut it. Teams are made up of human beings and we are dynamic, you need to expand your horizons.\n  2. Rohit Khatana, VP of Eng at Qoala was a speaker at our recent event, The Middle Ground and he shared that he divides DORA into two categories when it comes to the software delivery team.\n\n     * Quality/Reliability indicators: CFR & MTTR\n     * Speed/Velocity indicators: Lead Time & Deployment Frequency\n\nAs you can guess, optimizing for just one of these would mean disaster sooner\nor later. For example: If you optimize just for CFR & MTTR, your team won\u2019t be\nable to meet demands on time losing user trust and brand value.\n\n## The Missing Human Element in DORA\n\nSoftware development isn't just about lines of code. We both agree on this,\nright?\n\n\u201cDORA provides zero visibility into the factors that truly make or break\nteams\u201d Well, to this I won\u2019t say these factors alone \u201ctruly\u201d make or break\nteams, but yes these are extremely important.\n\nEngineers are a breed that likes to solve problems while staying away from as\nmuch bureaucracy as possible. So as an engineering leader we are anyways\nrequired to leverage frameworks as DORA but then also other things to make\nsure that our developers get what they want and need to be the best developers\n& solve problems!\n\nHere are a few points and possible ways to think about them.\n\n### Team Morale\n\nA software delivery team overwhelmed by burnout can artificially inflate their\nDORA metrics through back to back all nighters.\n\nYet, the low morale is a huge threat to sustained software delivery success.\nIt's essential to recognize that DORA metrics alone may not signal this\nimpending crisis.\n\nAs a leader you must understand your team\u2019s motivation levels, morale and of\ncourse also remember they are humans and need rest!\n\n### Toxic Culture\n\nA blame-heavy toxic culture where mistakes are hidden instead of addressed can\nlook amazing by DORA standards.\n\nThat is, until everything catches fire.\n\nDORA won\u2019t make you a better engineering leader who facilitates great culture,\nthat is subjective and you must take ownership.\n\n### Baseline & Benchmark Metrics\n\nDORA benchmarks developed for a Silicon Valley startup experimenting with\nbleeding-edge tech are irrelevant to a team maintaining a legacy financial\nsystem under strict regulatory compliance.\n\nNuance and understanding of context is crucial to leverage DORA properly.\n\nBlanket advice/metrics don\u2019t work well for anyone.\n\nThis is where it\u2019s essential to sometimes ignore the benchmark reports and\nrather focus on your own baseline and process improvement on top of that.\n\n## Finding the Middle Ground\n\nDORA isn't inherently evil, but it's a tool with limitations, easily misused,\neasily misunderstood.\n\nHere are a few ideas that can help you strike a healthy balance.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis is Key\n\nAnother consistent theme I saw while going through tons of comments was \"these\nmetrics make it easy to throw blame when the devs might not be the ones to\nblame at all\"\n\nIdeally sudden changes in your DORA metric trends should ignite an\ninvestigation, not automatic blame.\n\nFor example increased lead times might signal a knowledge gap that can be\nsolved with training.\n\nOr an uptick in your CFR might highlight a testing deficiency. The key is to\ncompare the metrics to your baseline then based on metric changes you can spot\nthings one by one and try to find the root cause.\n\n### Track DORA Alongside Other Metrics\n\nI\u2019ve probably said this at least 5 times already in this article, but I\u2019ll say\nit again.\n\nDORA metrics provide valuable signals but should never be your sole source of\ntruth for engineering team health.\n\nYou can correlate DORA trends with customer satisfaction metrics such as NPS,\nCSAT, feature adoption rates, or conversion metrics.\n\nFor example, did that rapid deployment pace actually make users happier, or\ncause confusing UX regressions?\n\nIdeally you would need to track code coverage alongside DORA. If deployment\nfrequency rises, but test coverage goes down, you're accumulating technical\ndebt that will harm future velocity.\n\n### Leadership Should Set the Tone\n\nA common pushback I see from developers around developer productivity is \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want everything I do getting tracked by my manager\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want to\nget micromanaged\u201d\n\nWell, the culture and expectations are to be set by the leadership. For\nexample, DORA doesn\u2019t really give you much about individual devs, but it gives\nyou team health.\n\nSo the call might be to first explore training and education within the team\nso everyone is on the same page and aligned to get the product and business\nmoving forward.\n\nAlso, DORA's success hinges on leadership understanding its strengths and\nlimitations.\n\nAs the engineering leader your job is to communicate clearly that DORA is a\ndiagnostic tool to spark conversations, not a tournament leaderboard to spark\ncompetition between teams or people.\n\nOne example would be to publicly recognize efforts to improve metrics, not\njust the highest absolute numbers.\n\nYou can recognize engineers who identify workflow flaws, showing that system\nfunctionality trumps over temporary metric boosts.\n\nEncourage sustainable practices over unsustainable efforts.\n\nKeep things transparent by sharing DORA data openly, addressing fluctuations,\nand prioritizing system improvement in retrospectives even when things might\nnot be going your way.\n\n## The DORA Hate is Good\n\nThe ever so passionate arguments around DORA highlight one thing: Measuring\nsoftware engineering productivity is a tough & complex task.\n\nIt's a sign that we want to make data driven decisions as engineering leaders\nbut we yet don\u2019t have a broader engineering management manual in place that\ntakes everything into account!\n\nDORA metrics are a very important piece of the puzzle, but they\u2019re not the\nwhole picture.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n## Secrets of high performing Software Engineering teams right in your inbox\n\nThank you!
