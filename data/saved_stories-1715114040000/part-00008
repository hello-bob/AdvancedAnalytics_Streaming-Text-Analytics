The new iPad Pro makes the leap to the M4 chip, the\nnext-generation of Apple silicon, for improved performance. Apple touted its\nnew Neural Engine to stress the artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nThe new tablets feature OLED displays, offering richer contrast and\nbrightness, housed in a new thinner industrial design that is significantly\nsmaller and lighter; the 11-inch is 5.3mm thin and the 13-inch is 5.1mm thin,\nwhich Apple says makes it the thinnest product they have ever created. The new\n11-inch model starts at a higher $999 price point, and the 13-inch model\nstarts at $1299.\n\nThe new iPad Pro OLED display offers up to 1600 peak HDR brightness, with\nbrighter highlights and deeper blacks compared to the old mini-LED panels.\nApple is calling this the \u2018Ultra Retina XDR display\u2019.\n\nThe OLED panel component is thinner and lighter, enabling the new overall\nindustrial design. Apple is also offering an anti-glare nano-texture glass\noption for the first time on iPad.\n\nThe M4 chip includes a new display controller that helps drive the OLED\ndisplay, as well as the CPU and GPU advancements that you would expect. The\nnew 10-core CPU offers up to 50% CPU performance compared to the previous M2\niPad Pro. M4 is built on a second-generation 3 nanometer fabrication process.\n\nThe new GPU brings hardware ray tracing and mesh shading to iPad for the first\ntime, with overall up to 4x faster rendering performance compared to M2. The\nnew Neural Engine and CPU machine learning accelerators makes the M4 chip an\n\u201coutrageously powerful chip for AI\u201d, according to Apple.\n\nAdditionally, the new industrial design improves the thermals of the device by\nup to 20%, leading to an overall 4x performance boost compared to the\nprevious-generation iPad Pro.\n\nApple has also upgraded the camera modules in the new iPad Pro to take better\nimages, and an adaptive flash improves capture for document scanning tasks.\nThe front facing camera moves to the landscape edge, allowing for a better\nperspective for FaceTime calls.\n\nThe new iPad Pro is also compatible with the new versions of the Magic\nKeyboard and Apple Pencil accessories.\n\nThe new iPad Pro starts at 256 GB, an increase on the base storage. The\n11-inch is priced starting at $999 and the new 13-inch model starts at $1299.\nThey are available to order starting today.\n\nFollow Benjamin: @bzamayo on Threads and Twitter.\n\nAdd 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
