Taming Silicon Valley,\nwhich I finished yesterday, was the fastest, written with urgency, in rage and\nin fear.\n\nThe premise of the book is that Silicon Valley is increasingly controlling our\nlives, and indeed the entire world, and that Washington (seat of the US\ngovernment) is too much in their thrall to stand up tall enough against it.\nAnd that we need to act, now.\n\nI don\u2019t want to see what Ian Bremmer calls a \u201ctechnopolar\u201d world, dominated by\na few big tech companies, because I don\u2019t have enough faith in Silicon Valley\nto do well by us, especially after how they have handled social media.\nWashington is supposed to be a counterweight, to keep the captain of\nindustries honest. So far, they haven\u2019t done enough.\n\nA lot of my books are about science and technology; this one is mostly about\ntechnology policy, and how Silicon Valley is running the table. One of the\nchapters in the book is called \u201cThe moral descent of Silicon Valley\u201d, another\nchapter is about how Silicon Valley manipulates public opinion. Still another\nis about how they are playing Washington. Another whole section is about what\nwe should actually be doing.\n\nNovels often having \u201cinciting incidents\u201d that lead their characters on a\nquest. The book itself had an inciting incident: my own growing sense that\nWashington was not going to get us to where we need to be.\n\nFrom my time testifying at the Senate I know Washington wants to do the right\nthing here. But I no longer feel confident that they will.\n\nDisillusionment began when the White House had its first big meeting/photo\nopportunity around AI, in May, 2023. VP Harris and (briefly) President Biden\ngrinned along with a bunch of tech CEO\u2019s; skeptical scientists were nowhere to\nbe seen.\n\nWhat the tech industry wants, in their ideal world, is \u201cself-regulation\u201d, in\nwhich they are pretty much free to do what they want. That\u2019s basically what\u2019s\nhappened with social media, and it\u2019s been a disaster.\n\nI really really don\u2019t want to see that happen with AI. But if the White House\ntreats tech CEOs like rock stars, those rock stars are going to call the\nshots.\n\nThe queasiness I felt after the White House photo op increased in September,\nwith an event organized by Senator Schumer, arguably the single most important\nplayer at the moment, since as Majority Leader he decides what legislation\naround AI might be voted on. In something of a replay of that May White House\nmeeting, Schumer held a widely publicized but closed-to-the-public meeting on\nAI, again treating the tech CEOs as rock stars, and again largely leaving out\nindependent scientists.\n\nMarietje Schaake, a former member of the European Parliament, wrote some harsh\nwords at the time:\n\nDeb Raji, a spectacular Berkeley PhD student who works on AI policy, is the\nonly one I would recognize there as an independent scientist. Literally nobody\nwho had spent decades researching the technical side AI was invited. That\ndidn\u2019t sit well with me.\n\nParticularly since Silicon Valley is prone to hype, Washington needs\nindependent scientists in the room.\n\n\u00a7\n\nEventually a series of incidents like that \u2013 combined with inaction from\nSchumer, who controls what AI legislation if any is actually voted on \u2013 led me\nto write the book. I grew more and more frustrated that when it came to AI, we\njust weren\u2019t going to get the legislation we needed.\n\nThe book is about what legislation we need, but more than that, it\u2019s a call to\narms, an exhortation to citizens to get involved, and to demand what we need.\n(It\u2019s also a detailed analysis of what we need, and how we got to where we\nare.)\n\nAlthough the White House did everything in its power with its AI Executive\nOrder, the White House doesn\u2019t have enough power to write laws; that\u2019s not how\nour constitution works. They aren\u2019t allowed to write laws. The legislative\nbranch has to write laws. Schumer has had something like nine closed door\nmeetings on AI, but (to my knowledge) yet to bring a single AI-related piece\nof legislation to the Senate floor. If he doesn\u2019t, we are sitting ducks.\n\nTo take but one example, I have been warning for years, in all capital\nletters, that things were about to get bad with misinformation and elections\n(e.g. in my December 2022 essay here about LLM\u2019s being AI\u2019s Jurassic Park\nmoment, for example). But nobody did anything about it. Over a year ago in The\nAtlantic, I urged that we come up with laws and new technological responses to\nblunt the impact of AI-generated misinformation. So far almost nothing has\nbeen done.\n\nThis morning The Washington Post reported, exactly as I warned, that \u201cAI\ndeepfakes threaten to upend global elections. No one can stop them. As more\nthan half the global population heads to the polls in 2024, AI-powered audio,\nimages and videos are sowing confusion and clouding the political debate\u201d. We\nwaited too long.\n\n\u00a7\n\nOne of the major themes of Taming Silicon Valley is the need for independent\noversight; as the old proverb so rightly puts it, the fox can\u2019t guard the\nhenhouse. I talk, for example, about how Washington often gets co-opted by\nlobbyists, and stress the need for independent scientists to be at the table,\nboth as we develop policy and as we make sure that our new technologies are\nsafe.\n\nSo it was mega-weird yesterday to finish reviewing the copy-edited manuscript\nof my book (pretty much the last chance to make significant changes) and see\nat exactly that moment yet another vivid example of Washington sucking up too\nmuch to Silicon Valley: a new blue-ribbon commission, largely overlapping with\nthe one that Schaake rightly criticized, in large part made up of the same\ntech CEOs. One legit scientist that I respect was added \u2013 Fei Fei Li. But\nbasically it\u2019s regulatory capture all over again. Technologist/activist Ed\nNewton-Rex said it nicely in a X post that mirrors Schaake\u2019s from August:\n\nWhen I groused about this yesterday to a friend who is well-connected in\nWashington, the friend reminded me that part of the problem is the revolving\ndoor: \u201cEveryone who is in [Washington] and wants to leave [after the election]\nwants to go to an AI company.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to envision the independence we might need when nobody\nin Washington knows where they will be come January, and pots of gold await in\nthe Bay Area. Especially when essentially everyone in Washington is underpaid.\n\n\u00a7\n\nIt\u2019s hard to write about technology these days, with things moving so swiftly.\nSometimes I worried, from a personal perspective, that the book would seem\nobsolete by the time it came out in September.\n\nIn the best case, the book would be obsolete for the best of reasons: somehow\nWashington would get it together, and protect us from disinformation,\naccidental misinformation, cybercrime, deepfake porn, and all the many other\nAI-related risks I discuss, finally standing up to Silicon Valley, finally\nincorporating a cadre of independent scientists as a counterweight to big\ntech, entirely obviating the need for my book.\n\nWe should all be so lucky. Washington remains in Silicon Valley\u2019s thrall, our\nelections are under siege, deepfake scams are everywhere, and not one law has\npassed.\n\nEvery one of us should be worried.\n\nGary Marcus desperately wants to see a thriving, AI-positive world, but\ndoesn\u2019t know how to get there unless Washington stands up to Silicon Valley.\nAll profits from Taming Silicon Valley will be donated to charity.\n\n85 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n9 Restacks\n\n85\n\nShare this post\n\n#### We can\u2019t trust the fox to guard the henhouse, especially when it comes to\nAI\n\ngarymarcus.substack.com\n\n69\n\nShare\n\n69 Comments\n\nClariceApr 27Liked by Gary MarcusI am an artist and a mother, and I am feeling\nextremely worried about the current state of the world.

First...\"Amazed, I went back to look\nat the other results only to realise almost all of them had to be brand new AI\nspam sites pumped up in the results by SEO tactics, or perhaps copying other\nwebsites' metadata to displace them as I recalled seeing a CEO mentioned as\ndoing (probably from this publication). It was not long ago every result was\nwritten by a human; now, I could scarcely find a single search result that\nwas.I had slightly more luck looking for a vacuum cleaner finding human\nreviews. On the other hand, I was looking for some new cat toys and found AI\ncats (of course never labelled) mixed into video results and marketing images\n(formerly photos).What is the world coming to when there is so much junk AI\n\"information\" to wade through making everyday purchases? And if businesses can\nso quickly pollute the Internet with junk on things that don't matter that\nmuch, what are the better motivated like states, intelligence, their\nstakeholders, and other political actors doing that I haven't noticed? If\nbusiness is doing it, they must be.The consequences of LLMs are not a future\nissue but a present one, and the way they're being used is mortifying,\ndrowning the Internet in a sea of crap.Expand full commentLike (14)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies\n\n67 more comments...\n\nThings are about to get a lot worse for Generative AI\n\nA full of spectrum of infringment\n\nDec 29, 2023 \u2022\n\nGary Marcus\n\n237\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Things are about to get a lot worse for Generative AI\n\ngarymarcus.substack.com\n\n161\n\nWhat if Generative AI turned out to be a Dud?\n\nSome possible economic and geopolitical implications\n\nAug 13, 2023 \u2022\n\nGary Marcus\n\n299\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What if Generative AI turned out to be a Dud?\n\ngarymarcus.substack.com\n\n134\n\nChatGPT has gone berserk\n\nNot a joke\n\nFeb 21 \u2022\n\nGary Marcus\n\n137\n\nShare this post\n\n#### ChatGPT has gone berserk\n\ngarymarcus.substack.com\n\n88\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Gary Marcus\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
