Grab it while it\u2019s hot!\n\nSome highlights:\n\n  * Welcome Screen\n  * New Filepicker\n  * Pipes\n  * Open Floating Panes at Specific Coordinates\n  * Rearrange Tabs\n  * Disconnect other Clients\n  * Plugin Aliases\n  * New Possible Keys to Bind\n  * Start session in the background\n  * Performance Improvements\n  * Do you like Zellij? \u2764\ufe0f\n\n## Welcome Screen\n\nThis new release introduces the \u201cwelcome screen\u201d. The welcome screen is a\nfriendly menu, intended to be run on terminal startup and allow users to\neither:\n\n  1. Start a new session (optionally with a specific name or in a chosen folder)\n  2. Attach to a running session\n  3. Resurrect an exited session\n\nLearn more about session management.\n\n## New Strider / Filepicker\n\nThis release includes a complete rework of Zellij\u2019s built-in filepicker,\nStrider. The filepicker allows users to quickly browse through their\nfilesystem, opening files in their default editor in new Zellij panes or\nopening a terminal in a specific location.\n\nWith the help of pipes, one can use this filepicker to interactively choose a\nfile or folder in the filesystem and pipe the result to another command\nthrough a traditional shell pipe. For example:\n\n    \n    \n    zpipe filepicker | xargs -i cp {} my-chosen-file\n\nBash\n\nThe filepicker can also be used from within other plugins to offload\nfilepicking functionality rather than have the plugin implement it on its own.\nIn fact, this is exactly what the welcome screen does in the example at the\ntop of this post.\n\nLearn more about the filepicker.\n\n## Pipes\n\nZellij pipes are a new way to send messages to plugins and allow plugins to\ncommunicate with each other.\n\nMessages can be sent to plugins through the CLI: (eg. zpipe my-plugin hi!),\nfrom a keybinding or indeed from another plugin. A destination plugin that\ndoes not exist will be loaded on the first pipe message.\n\nPipes also integrate seamlessly with existing shell pipes, providing flow\ncontrol and giving plugin authors the ability to visualize data from the\ncommand line, allow users to pause a command line pipe mid-stream on certain\nmessages or on a keystroke. We believe this functionality will help utilize\nthe full 2 dimensions of the terminal window as never before, popping up\nfloating panes in certain conditions and creating a many-to-many windowed\npipeline. We look forward to seeing what plugin authors come up with!\n\nLearn more about Pipes\n\n## Open Floating Panes at Specific Coordinates\n\nA much requested feature after the introduction of floating panes, was to be\nable to open floating panes at specific coordinates and at specific sizes. Ths\nis now possible from the CLI, from plugins or from a keybinding (either with\nfixed numbers or percentage of the viewport):\n\n    \n    \n    zellij run --floating --width 50 --height 20% -x 10% -y 50% -- htop\n\nSh\n\n## Rearrange Tabs\n\nThanks to a community contribution, it\u2019s now possible to change the position\nof tabs. One can move the active tab left or right, by default with Alt i or\nAlt o.\n\n## Disconnect other Clients\n\nZellij, as a true multiplayer application, allows more than one user to attach\nto a running session. When this happens, each user gets their own cursor and\nthe UI indicates in which pane or tab they are focused.\n\nSince by necessity the smallest screen width/height is used in such cases, it\nis sometimes desirable to log out other users from the session.\n\nThis is now possible through the session-manager: Ctrl o to open the session\nmanager, and then Ctrl x to disconnect other users.\n\n## Plugin Aliases\n\nThis version introduces \u201cPlugin Aliases\u201d which are a way to shorten the long\nplugin URLs (eg. https://example.com/my-plugin.wasm, or\nfile:/home/aram/code/plugin/my-plugin.wasm) to something more memorable (eg.\nfilter or filepicker). These aliases can be defined in the configuration file,\nand used wherever plugin URLs can be used: to launch plugins from the CLI,\nfrom layouts or from other plugins.\n\nAliases can also be a convenient way to swap in the built-in plugins for a\ncustom implementation (eg. using the excellent zjstatus, instead of the built-\nin compact bar). Indeed, the filepicker described above is an internal alias\nfor the built-in Strider plugin, and can be swapped out for a custom\nimplementation of the filepicker using the same contract.\n\nRead more about Plugin Aliases.\n\n## New Possible Keys to Bind\n\nThanks to some community contributions, it is now possible to bind Ctrl/Alt +\nFunction keys (eg. Ctrl F1), as well as Ctrl Space. We as Zellij maintainers\nare aware that colliding keybindings are a big problem for many users and\nintend to fully and finally address this issue in the next version after this\none.\n\n## Start session in the background\n\nnother much requested feature was added in this release: it\u2019s now possible to\nstart a new Zellij session in the background with the new zellij attach\n--create-background flag.\n\n## Performance Improvements\n\nThis version introduces two major performance improvements:\n\n  * Line wrapping of extremely long (10M+) lines is now significantly faster thanks to a community contribution.\n  * Rendering of full-screen terminal applications is now much smoother thanks to the implementation of CSI 2026 (synchronized renders) in those terminals that support it.\n\n## Do you like Zellij? \u2764\ufe0f\n\nMe too! So much so that I spend 100% of my time developing and maintaining it\nand have no other income.\n\nZellij will always be free and open-source. Zellij will never contain ads or\ncollect your data.\n\nSo if the tool gives you value and you are able, please consider a recurring\nmonthly donation of 5-10$ to help me pay my bills. There are Zellij stickers\nin it for you!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
