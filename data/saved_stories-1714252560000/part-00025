Now, they make inferior products and treat their\nworkers terribly. This is not coincidental. It is a prime example of\nenshittification, a term I coined in 2022 to describe the process through\nwhich monopolistic tech platforms decay in the absence of any checks on their\nleaders\u2019 worst impulses.\n\nHistorically, tech companies have been disciplined by four forces: competition\n(the fear that users might switch to rival services); regulation (the fear\nthat government penalties will exceed the profits the firm expects to realize\nfrom questionable practices); self-help (the fear of aftermarket\nmodifications, such as ad blockers or third-party clients, which undermine the\nfirm\u2019s ability to profit from users, perhaps permanently); and the firm\u2019s\nworkers \u2013 specifically, the fear that key personnel would quit rather than\nobey certain directives.\n\nThese forces are interlinked. A truly competitive industry, with dozens or\nhundreds of firms aggressively nipping at each other\u2019s profit margins, is less\nable to capture its regulators. A concentrated industry dominated by a handful\nof firms can easily align on policy priorities and present a unified front to\nregulators, judges, and lawmakers. But an industry constituted as a swarm of\ncompeting firms would find it nearly impossible to accomplish such unity.\n\nhttps://prosyn.org/8cqE4xV\n\n## To continue reading, register now.
