The application was made \"without notice to the Husband's solicitors \u2013\nthe Wife's solicitors considered at the time that this was the correct\napproach given that the Final Order itself had been made without notice.\"\n\nIn the ensuing legal melee, Mr Williams, previously unaware of his sudden\nsingle status, received a letter sent by HMCTS the same day as the accidental\ndivorce, stating that he was no longer married. But it was not until October\n11, a week later, that he was formally informed of his bachelorhood by his ex-\nwife's solicitors. Meanwhile, his solicitors entered the fray, demanding that\nthe case be brought before the President of the Family Division to sort out\nthis matrimonial muddle.\n\nAs the courts attempted to untangle this knot, a directionless decree by\nDeputy District Judge Underhill seemed to resolve the issue by setting aside\nthe divorce order. However, this order was marred by vague wording and\nquestionable legality, leading to further disputes about whether Mr and Mrs\nWilliams were indeed married or divorced.\n\n  * Sleuths who cracked Zodiac Killer's cipher thank the crowd\n  * Rancher faces prison for trying to breed absolute unit of a sheep\n  * 'Chemical cat' on the loose in Japanese city\n  * Olympic-level server tossing contest seeks entrants \u2013 warranty voiding guaranteed\n\nThus it was over to McFarlane, who agreed with the husband's lawyers that\nthere was no authority for setting aside a decree absolute where there had\nbeen complete procedural regularity.\n\nHe ruled that it was \"in the public interest that a final order of divorce\nshould be unimpeachable when 'granted by a court with competent jurisdiction\nand after compliance with the correct procedural requirements'. A final order\nmade without procedural irregularity should stand for all the world.\"\n\nHe further advised: \"If the Wife has a remedy for what has occurred, it is\nthrough an action for negligence against her solicitors and not by seeking to\nset aside the final order.\"\n\nAyesha Vardag, head of the law firm, took issue with the ruling, reportedly\ntelling the BBC that the judge's decision boiled down to \"the computer says\nno, you're divorced.\"\n\nShe described the verdict as a \"bad decision\" and that the state \"should not\nbe divorcing people on the basis of a clerical error,\" insisting there has to\nbe \"intention\" on the part of the person divorcing.\n\n\"When a mistake is brought to a court's attention, and everyone accepts that a\nmistake has been made, it obviously has to be undone,\" she said. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Legal\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Legal\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Discrimination\n  * Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965\n  * Software License\n  * Telecommunications Act of 1996\n\n#### More about\n\n19 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Legal\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Legal\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Discrimination\n  * Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965\n  * Software License\n  * Telecommunications Act of 1996\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Cloud server host Vultr rips user data licensing clause from ToS amid web\n'confusion'\n\nUpdated We know the average customer doesn't have a law degree, CEO tells us\n\nPaaS + IaaS19 days | 27\n\n#### SAP accused of age discrimination, retaliation by US whistleblower\n\nComplainant moved to 'retire in place' role after Sarbanes Oxley Act report,\nfiling alleges\n\nSaaS1 month | 10\n\n#### Congress votes unanimously to ban brokers selling American data to\nenemies\n\nAt least we can all agree on something\n\nSecurity26 days | 19\n\n#### Reducing the cloud security overhead\n\nWhy creating a layered defensive strategy that includes security by design can\nhelp address cloud challenges\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### UK tech titan Mike Lynch's US fraud trial begins today\n\n13-year saga continues as jury set to hear claims on both sides of HP's\nAutonomy acquisition disaster\n\nApplications29 days | 10\n\n#### Rancher faces prison for trying to breed absolute unit of a sheep\n\nEwe-nique endeavor aimed to create Jurassic Baaa-rk experience for hunters\n\nBootnotes1 month | 110\n\n#### Filing NeMo: Nvidia's AI framework hit with copyright lawsuit\n\nClaims allegedly pirated content from Books3 dataset trawled by its models\n\nAI + ML1 month | 8\n\n#### Judge slaps down law firm using ChatGPT to justify six-figure trial fee\n\nUse of AI to calculate legal bill 'utterly and unusually unpersuasive'\n\nAI + ML2 months | 87\n\n#### Ransomware ban backers insist thugs must be cut off from payday\n\nIncreasingly clear number of permanent solutions is narrowing\n\nCyber-crime1 month | 22\n\n#### Legal eagles demand $6B in Tesla stock after overturning Musk's mega pay\npackage\n\n'Criminal,' says CEO\n\nOffbeat1 month | 58\n\n#### Nikola founder faces ranch forfeiture following fraud conviction\n\nTrevor Milton bought it for cash and stock options, and he wants the cash back\n\nLegal2 months | 13\n\n#### Palo Alto investor sues over 28% share tumble\n\nUpdated Lawsuit alleges it misled investors with claims new AI products were\n'facilitating greater platformization' and more\n\nSecurity2 months | 23\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
