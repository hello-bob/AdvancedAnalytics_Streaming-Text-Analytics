Nowadays, it\u2019s a fairly\nmundane thing. 97% of Americans own one. But if you showed it to a computer\nscientist 70 years ago, it would be regarded as unfathomably powerful and\nmiraculous. The number of transistors, the basic building blocks of modern\ncomputing power, has grown exponentially since the 50s, when the world\u2019s first\ntransistor was developed.1\n\nBuilt in 1945, the ENIAC, the world\u2019s first electronic digital computer, had\nthe equivalent of 25,000 transistors (before transistors, computers used\nvacuum tubes and diodes for computing power). Deep Blue, the famous IBM\nsupercomputer that beat chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997, had a total\nof roughly 900 million transistors. Today\u2019s average smartphone has over 10\nbillion. Your average laptop and desktop computers have even more. In the 79\nyears since the world\u2019s first computer, the average transistor count has\nincreased by a factor of 4 million\n\nWikipedia\n\nEven more remarkable is the cost of computing. The ENIAC cost the Federal\ngovernment $487,000 to build, or roughly 7 million dollars in 2024 dollars.\nThe average cost of a smartphone in 2024 is just about 1,000 dollars. The\nsmartphone you have in your hand is 400,000x more powerful than the ENIAC for\n0.014% of the cost. Even more amazingly, the ENIAC took up 1800 square feet on\nthe ground floor of a building at the University of Pennsylvania. The average\nsmartphone is just over 13 square inches of area. So not only is your\nsmartphone 400,000x more powerful, its footprint is also 20,000x smaller. That\nis absolutely mindboggling.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the ENIAC was originally used to calculate the\nballistic trajectories of artillery pieces and the program to build it came\nout of military exigencies of WWII, the most traumatic and violent war ever\nfought. Any comparison of present day life to any other period of time in\nhistory is going to be an extremely lopsided affair. Life as we know it in\n2024 is nothing short of miraculous, and with each full rotation of the Earth,\nall of us rely on a series of miracles to get us through the day.\n\nIt Doesn\u2019t Stop At the Supercomputer in Your Pocket\n\nNowadays it\u2019s fashionable to complain about increases in the price of food.\nBut when you go to the supermarket and look at the produce aisle, what do you\nsee? Oranges, apples, pineapples, blueberries, strawberries, lettuce,\ntomatoes, carrots, and dozens of other fruits and vegetables available all day\nevery day throughout the year.\n\nIn other words, there is no such thing as seasonal foods anymore. Modern\nsupply chains stretch across the world, so that whenever the growing season\nends in one region, it begins in another. You can buy any kind of fresh\nproduce at any time of the year, and at a price that you can afford. We may\ngrumble about inflation, but these prices are still much lower than at any\nother point in history. Before the 20th century, the vast majority of the\nworld spent the majority of their income solely on food.\n\nMasters of the Air\n\nGoing back to WWII, I recently watched the show Masters of the Air2. In one\nscene, an airman preparing to drop humanitarian supplies to the starving Dutch\nremarks on how it would have been years since the average Dutch would have\nseen a fresh orange. If you\u2019ve ever seen an old fashioned juice glass and\nwondered why it was so small (most are between 4-5 fluid ounces in capacity),\nit\u2019s because juice was so expensive for much of its existence, only consumed\nregularly by the elite of society. Nowadays, anyone can afford it.\n\nIn the 18th century, it was common for the British middle class to rent\npineapples purely for decorative display, as they were far too expensive\n(roughly $14,000 today) for them to actually eat. Nowadays, I can go into\nKroger and buy one for less than 5 dollars at any day of the year. The very\nnotion of renting food for the purpose of showing it off is utterly\nbewildering nowadays.\n\nOr the Foods You See at the Supermarket\n\nPeople are living longer and healthier lives. Infectious diseases, the most\ncommon cause of death for the vast majority of human existence, now barely\nregisters as a major cause of death. Even during the COVID pandemic, roughly 7\nmillion people died between December 2019 and May 2023 due to the coronavirus,\nbut even that is a small portion of the ~160 million people who died of any\ncause during that same period.\n\nAntibiotics, a modern medicinal miracle, and vaccines have saved countless\nlives from so many deadly diseases. Antiretroviral drugs and therapies changed\nHIV from a death sentence to a condition more manageable than diabetes. We\nhave gene therapies that can cure previously fatal congenital diseases and\nconditions. There are so many lifechanging and lifesaving medicines available\nnow that couldn\u2019t be had at any price even just 50 years ago.\n\nTravel used to be extremely dangerous and time consuming. Most people would\nspend the vast majority of their lives within 10 miles of where they were\nborn. Air travel has only been commercially available for a century, and for\nmuch of its history, used only by the very wealthy and powerful. Now anyone\ncan fly across the country for a few hundred dollars. Automobile ownership is\ncommonplace through all segments of society, and people now routinely travel\n10+ miles every day safely, quickly, cheaply, and comfortably.\n\nWho\u2019s Got it Better Than Us?\n\nIn Voltaire\u2019s Candide, Dr. Pangloss, Candide\u2019s tutor, routinely insists to\nCandide that \u201call is for the best in this best of all possible worlds\u201d as the\ncharacter experiences tragedy after tragedy in his travels throughout the\nworld. Voltaire portrays Pangloss as an educated fool, utterly out of his\ndepth as the common cruelties and tragedies of the 18th century are inflicted\nupon the main characters in every chapter.\n\nBut even as Pangloss improbably hangs onto his belief that everything works\nout in the end, the ending of Candide does have (admittedly a far more\ncynical) Candide and his companions (Pangloss included) on a peaceful farm,\ncontent in their existence if not exactly happy.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how well that parallels with the present day. Modern\nday life is incredible, in every sense of the word. And yet, anxiety, fear,\nand distrust seem to dominate the headlines while optimism is hard to find. In\nthe real world, Pangloss should be beating his chest and taking a victory lap.\nBut everyone around him is just tired of his shit.\n\nMake no mistake, I am not saying life is perfect and great for everyone. A\ntenth of the global population still lives in extreme poverty. But by those\nsame standards, just about all of humanity lived in extreme poverty a few\ncenturies ago, and were far more likely to die of pestilence, hunger, and war.\nBut in those intervening centuries, society has progressed by leaps and bounds\nand now the common person enjoys things today that would be considered\nimpossible luxuries not too long ago.\n\nAnd Yet...\n\n16 years ago, the playwright David Mamet wrote a piece in the Village Voice\ntitled \u201cWhy I Am No Longer a Brain Dead Liberal\u201d ahead of the upcoming\nelection, about his change in ideology from liberal to some sort of\nconservative/libertarian hybrid. In his essay, he writes that, generally\nspeaking, his life is going pretty well and so are the lives of people around\nhim. But even so:\n\n> there is such a thing as liberalism, and it may be reduced to these saddest\n> of words: \u201d . . . and yet . . . \u201c\n\nLife is great. Unfathomably great. And yet it can always be better. That\ndriving impulse, to seek out a newer, better way of doing things never goes\naway, and it\u2019s why humanity currently enjoys its newfound superabundance of\nmaterial prosperity. Conversely, it becomes easy to fixate and well on the\nremaining inequities and tragedies that still exist in the world.\n\nAdam Smith once remarked that \u201cthere is a great deal of ruin in a nation\u201d.\nEven in a country as safe and as prosperous as ours, a country of 330 million\npeople will always have some amount of ruin and tragedy. It\u2019s perhaps ironic\nthat our material prosperity and technological progress has made it incredibly\neasy to fixate on the negative, as younger generations report increasing\nanxiety as they\u2019re doomscrolling through the worst of what\u2019s happening\nthroughout the world.\n\nMy unsolicited advice to everybody, but to younger people in particular, is to\ntake a deep breath, find ways to be grateful for what you do have, learn more\nabout the world (and don\u2019t just fixate on the negative) to gain a better sense\nof perspective, and then move intentionally and expeditiously towards the\nthings you want. Modern life is a miracle, make it your miracle.\n\nThanks for reading The Unabashed Observer!

In any case, it\u2019s far better than The Pacific.\n\nShare this post\n\n#### In This Best of All Possible Worlds\n\nunabashedobserver.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nAre You in a Virtuous or Destructive Cycle?\n\nThe organizing principle behind living life well\n\nJan 26 \u2022\n\nJay Sun\n\n5\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Are You in a Virtuous or Destructive Cycle?\n\nunabashedobserver.substack.com\n\nThe Right Person in the Right Place at the Right Time\n\nHow people's lives can change in an instant\n\nMar 1 \u2022\n\nJay Sun\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Right Person in the Right Place at the Right Time\n\nunabashedobserver.substack.com\n\nStarted From the Bottom and Now We're Lost\n\nEarly adulthood was always difficult, but it's challenging now in a way it's\nnever been\n\nFeb 16 \u2022\n\nJay Sun\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Started From the Bottom and Now We're Lost\n\nunabashedobserver.substack.com\n\n2\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Jay Sun\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
