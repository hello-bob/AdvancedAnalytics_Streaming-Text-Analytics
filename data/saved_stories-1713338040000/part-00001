But during the last 15 years or so, that wasn't always the case.\nToday, we resurface our look at the greatest MP3 player that was\u2014Winamp. This\npiece originally ran on June 24, 2012 (and Winamp finally called it quits in\nNovember 2013).\n\nMP3s are so natural to the Internet now that it\u2019s almost hard to imagine a\ntime before high-quality compressed music. But there was such a time\u2014and even\nafter \"MP3\" entered the mainstream, organizing, ripping, and playing back\none's music collection remained a clunky and frustrating experience.\n\nEnter Winamp, the skin-able, customizable MP3 player that \"really whips the\nllama's ass.\" In the late 1990s, every music geek had a copy; llama-whipping\nhad gone global, and the big-money acquisition offers quickly followed. AOL\nfamously acquired the company in June 1999 for $80-$100 million\u2014and Winamp\nalmost immediately lost its innovative edge.\n\nWinamp's 15-year anniversary is now upon us, with little fanfare. It\u2019s almost\nas if the Internet has forgotten about the upstart with the odd slogan that\nlooked at one time like it would be the company to revolutionize digital\nmusic. It certainly had the opportunity.\n\n\u201cThere's no reason that Winamp couldn\u2019t be in the position that iTunes is in\ntoday if not for a few layers of mismanagement by AOL that started immediately\nupon acquisition,\u201d Rob Lord, the first general manager of Winamp, and its\nfirst-ever hire, told Ars.\n\n### Further Reading\n\n\u201cOprah\u201d for indie bands: Apple once loved unknown acts\u2014what changed?\n\nJustin Frankel, Winamp's primary developer, seems to concur in an interview he\ngave to BetaNews. (He declined to be interviewed for this article.) \u201cI'm\nalways hoping that they will come around and realize that they're killing\n[Winamp] and find a better way, but AOL always seems too bogged down with all\nof their internal politics to get anything done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe problems began early, since Nullsoft wasn't interested in being a\ntraditional corporate unit. For instance, in 2000, just a year after the\nacquisition, Frankel released (and open sourced) Gnutella, a new \u201cheadless\u201d\npeer-to-peer file-sharing protocol that understandably steamed the bigwigs at\nAOL corporate headquarters in Dulles, Virginia.\n\nBy early 2004, Rolling Stone dubbed Nullsoft\u2019s founder the \u201cworld\u2019s most\ndangerous geek\u201d\u2014but companies like AOL aren't good fits for dangerous geeks.\nThat same year, Frankel resigned, writing on his website a few lines that were\nlater removed: \"For me, coding is a form of self-expression. The company\ncontrols the most effective means of self-expression I have. This is\nunacceptable to me as an individual, therefore I must leave.\"\n\nToday, Winamp continues to be updated; AOL released its first Android version\nin 2010 and a Mac version in 2011. Amazingly, given all the time elapsed, AOL\nstill makes a decent amount of money on the site and on the program\u2014while the\ncompany has declined to release official figures, former employees who worked\non Winamp estimate its current revenue at around $6 million annually. And\nWinamp still has an estimated user base of millions worldwide, a small\nfraction of which live in the United States.\n\nHowever, references to the application\u2019s storied history, both good and bad,\nhave been scrubbed or omitted from the Winamp current site\u2014it\u2019s just a big\nblank page. (Update: An Ars reader points out that the history page has moved,\nbut the link to the alumni page still reverts back to the home page.) So how\nexactly did Winamp squander the incredible head start it had on most other\nInternet music businesses? Here's how.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWinamp lives\u2014AOL released a version for Android in 2011.\n\nAOL\n\n## Out of the desert\n\nLike most companies, Winamp was created to solve a \u201cpain problem.\u201d That\nproblem? Two decades ago, it was pretty difficult to organize and play\ncompressed music, which had just started to enter mainstream usage.\n\nThe German scientists behind the MP3 format released their first encoder in\nJuly 1994, but for the next three years, it remained difficult to share and\nfind the resulting music files. Frankel has always created software \u201cbecause\nit was software that I wanted to be able to use,\u201d as he told the Digital Tools\nblog in 2008. \u201cWinamp grew out of wanting a good, enjoyable way to listen to\nMP3s on a computer. It wasn\u2019t the first MP3 player, but the MP3 players around\nbefore it were hard for me to want to use.\u201d\n\nPrior to Winamp, there wasn\u2019t much available beyond Windows Media Player or\nRealPlayer. But none of those players could, in the mid-1990s, do something as\nbasic as playlists, much less visualizations and custom skins, nor were they\nas tightly and efficiently programmed as Winamp. Even today, the Mac version\nof the Winamp installer is only 4.2MB; by comparison, the iTunes Mac installer\ncomes in at a whopping 170MB.\n\nThe Windows Advanced Multimedia Products (WinAMP) player was released to the\nworld on April 21, 1997. The next year, when its parent company Nullsoft\nformally incorporated, Winamp became $10 shareware. But no one pays for\nshareware, right? Wrong.\n\n\u201cNothing ever was broken [if you didn\u2019t pay], there was no feature that was\nunlocked,\u201d Rob Lord told Ars. \u201cIn that year before we were acquired, we were\nbringing in $100,000 a month from $10 checks\u2014paper checks in the mail!\u201d\n\nAt the time, Lord already had staked his first claim to fame: co-founding the\n(recently revived) Internet Underground Music Archive, the world\u2019s first\nonline legal music repository, while he was a student at the University of\nCalifornia, Santa Cruz. Today, Rob Lord works for his own startup, Sherpa.io,\nbased in the Hatchery, a SoMa (South of Market) co-working space in San\nFrancisco, just a five-minute walk from Twitter\u2019s original offices, alongside\na plethora of tech and tech media companies. Developers and entrepreneurs rub\nshoulders on sunny days in South Park, an adjacent outdoor space that features\na gourmet grilled cheese outfit, a taqueria, and a French restaurant with\nkiller quiches. In short, it\u2019s a long way from Sedona, Arizona, Frankel\u2019s\nhometown and the birthplace of Nullsoft.\n\nSeated on a couch in a Hatchery conference room and dressed in a T-shirt,\nshorts and sandals, Lord told me about his role at Nullsoft that began in May\n1999.\n\n\u201cMy title was director of online strategy, although we didn't know what that\nmeant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a lot of strategic and tactical decisions, around\neverything except the coding of the app itself. Justin was the one coding on\nit and he was the only one who had access to source code. I was being helpful\nby [looking at] product features [on a] business level\u2014I initiated the first\nmonetizing of the website.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was Lord\u2019s job to figure out how to make the company money. Like most 1990s\nstartups, the plan involved banner ads and possible partnership deals with\nother startups. Lord, then in his late 20s, moved from California to join the\n18-year-old Frankel, still living at his parents\u2019 home in Sedona,\nArizona\u2014where his father, attorney Charles Frankel, acted as the company\u2019s\ncounsel and chief financial officer.\n\nThis 10,000-person community in the Arizona desert attracts millions of\ntourists per year, and for decades has been home to people seeking to enjoy\nthe state\u2019s natural beauty and to take in the \u201cspiritual\u201d side of the place.\n\n\u201cYou have this rugged individualism and a very rugged spiritual set and\n[Frankel] came from that,\u201d Lord said. The Sedona ethos came through while\nmaking business decisions; Lord recalled one moment when there wasn\u2019t enough\ninformation to confidently come to a decision. \u201c'We'll just do x and let the\nuniverse decide,'\u201d he recalled Frankel saying. \u201cI think it describes the mode\nwe were in\u2014things happen for a reason.\u201d\n\nEnlarge / Rob Lord was Nullsoft's first hire, and worked with Justin Frankel\nin Sedona and San Francisco.\n\nScott Beale\n\n## Finding a buyer\n\nThe universe decided that Winamp was awesome. In the first two years that Lord\nworked with Nullsoft, Winamp\u2019s user base quadrupled from 15 million to 60\nmillion users\u2014and the acquisition offers arrived. \u201cThere was no meeting that\nwas ever turned down,\u201d Lord recalled.\n\nFew companies said it outright, but they would couch their queries in phrases\nlike, \u201cDo you guys have future plans?\u201d Before long it became hard to resist\nvaluation offers in the neighborhood of $100 million.\n\nIn June 1999, Nullsoft was acquired alongside Spinner (in a deal worth $400\nmillion for both), a streaming media player startup based in San Francisco.\nCharles Frankel, Justin\u2019s father, took in the second largest portion of the\nAOL acquisition deal, receiving around $15 million in stock at the time.\nFrankel himself got AOL stock worth nearly $60 million at the time.\n\nLord now says Nullsoft was \u201cacquired at the sweet spot of insanity,\u201d less than\na year before the January 2000 merger announcement of AOL and Time Warner,\nwhich eventually failed in spectacular fashion.\n\nAOL consolidated both properties into Spinner's offices, a single warehouse-\nturned-office on Alabama Street in the Mission District. The move to San\nFrancisco certainly provided a change of pace for tiny Nullsoft. \u201cI felt this\njuxtaposition of [our new environment] with [previously being in Sedona with\nFrankel and] operating out of his bedroom and us having meetings at his dad's\noffices, on the one road in town,\u201d Lord said.\n\nEveryone involved in the deal expected big things to result.\u201cThe thesis at\nthat time was that AOL could be really big in music, create within its four\nwalls the next MTV\u2014and that meant something in music in the 90s,\u201d Fred\nMcIntyre told Ars last month. McIntyre started off as a vice president at\nSpinner in 1998 and worked directly with Winamp until 2004, staying on at AOL.\nHe returned to Winamp in 2007.\n\n\u201cThe general logic was that Spinner had built a service and had a pretty well\nseasoned management team in place,\u201d McIntyre added. \u201cWinamp had built a\nproduct and a platform that was capable of generating meaningful user\nadoption.\u201d\n\n\u201cAOL, without telling either of us, bought us both,\u201d recalls Josh Felser.\nFelser was co-founder and president of Spinner from late 1997 until mid-1999,\nand later became an AOL vice president in charge of both units. Today, he's a\nventure capitalist at Freestyle Capital. \u201cThey threw us together and I was in\ncharge of both brands. It was obvious that our cultures were different, but it\nwasn't obvious that they would clash.\u201d\n\nAt first, Winamp kept riding high. \u201c[Winamp.com] was doing hundreds of\nmillions of page views a month in late 1990s,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cWe were just\npushing display ads through those. That was in and of itself a lucrative\nbusiness\u2014not a sexy business, but a lucrative business nonetheless.\u201d\n\nBut problems quickly became apparent.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n421\n\nCyrus Farivar Cyrus is a former Senior Tech Policy Reporter at Ars Technica,\nand is also a radio producer and author.
