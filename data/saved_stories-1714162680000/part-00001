In\nSeptember, the Lina Khan\u2013run FTC filed a historic suit against Amazon, arguing\nthat the Jeff Bezos\u2013founded company has illegally maintained a monopoly and\nartificially raised prices for consumers through policies and practices\nrelated to the treatment of its hundreds of thousands of Amazon sellers.\nAmazon has said the suit is meritless and that it will fight it in court; a\ntrial is not slated to begin until October 2026.\n\nIn the fall, the FTC alleged that Amazon executives destroyed evidence by\nusing Signal for communications for several years after the agency had\ninformed the company in 2019 that it was under investigation and should\npreserve all relevant documents and correspondence. The agency has said that\nexecutives, including Bezos and current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, used Signal,\nwhich includes a disappearing-message feature that can permanently delete\nmessages if the user turns it on.\n\n\u201cAmazon executives deleted many Signal messages during plaintiffs\u2019 pre-\ncomplaint investigation, and Amazon did not instruct its employees to preserve\nSignal messages until over 15 months after Amazon knew that plaintiffs\u2019\ninvestigation was underway,\u201d the FTC claims in the new filing. \u201cIt is highly\nlikely that relevant information has been destroyed.\u201d\n\nAmazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement: \u201cThe FTC has a complete\npicture of Amazon\u2019s decision-making in this case including 1.7 million\ndocuments from sources like email, internal messaging applications, and\nlaptops (among other sources), and over 100 terabytes of data.\u201d\n\nWhen the FTC\u2019s original allegations about evidence destruction went public in\nthe fall, Amazon called them \u201cbaseless\u201d and argued that Amazon had\n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d disclosed the use of Signal to the agency and turned over\nmessages that hadn\u2019t automatically been deleted.\n\nBut in the new filing, the FTC claims that Amazon only did so six days before\na news report noted the use of Signal by company executives.\n\nSubscribe to Data Sheet, our daily newsletter about the business of tech.
