With the arrival of 4K video, for example, developers\nquickly became aware that existing video codecs like H264 were no longer going\nto cut it. To that extent, AV1 has started to become the popular standard for\ndecoding and encoding on devices. Now, Google is ready to adapt to the\nchanging times, and it will soon be reflected on YouTube.\n\nRelated\n\n##### YouTube's 1080p enhanced bitrate option is now widely available on the\nweb\n\nAndroid device owners will have to wait a bit longer\n\nArif Dikici, who is a part of the Android Video and Image Codecs team at\nGoogle, recently announced on LinkedIn that Android will now use an AV1\ndecoder known as \u201clibdav1d,\u201d which was created by the team behind VLC. As\nspecified, all devices dating back to Android 12 will have native software\nsupport for the codec once they've received the March 2024 Google Play System\nUpdate.\n\n## YouTube going AV1 by default adds a wrinkle to the rollout\n\nWhile the update will bring improved AV1 codec support to a huge number of\nAndroid phones, it doesn't activate the new codec by default \u2014 instead, the\nexisting AV1 decoder, libgav1, is used, unless an app specifically requests to\nuse the newer dav1d decoder to process video. That's exactly what YouTube\nstarted doing immediately after this rollout began, and it's causing\ncontroversy among some Android users.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the codec is that it helps maintain video quality\nduring compression and decoding, so many users are excited about the potential\nfor higher quality AV1 video. However, not everyone is happy with the change \u2014\nparticularly those with older devices and midrange phones. It's mostly newer\nhigher-end phones that have hardware decoding support for AV1, so those with\nmidrange devices and older flagships may have to rely on software decoding now\nthat YouTube has opted in to the libdav1d decoder. Many of these Android users\nhave expressed concern over how the change will impact their battery life if\nit means a move away from hardware-accelerated decoding.\n\nWhile there are valid reasons to be concerned, it\u2019s worth noting that Google\nisn\u2019t the first to bring about such a change to a widely used service like\nYouTube. Back in 2020, Netflix did something similar for its Android app\nusers, making AV1 its new standard. Prior to this change, Netflix confirmed\nthat it had been using VP6 codec for its Android app. With the upgrade, it\nstarted to allow subscribers to stream content and also enabled the \u201cSave\ndata\u201d feature while leveraging mobile service. It doesn\u2019t seem like there was\nas much uproar over Netflix\u2019s move compared to what Android users are\ncurrently saying \u2014 perhaps time will ease the worries that emerged with\nGoogle\u2019s recent news.\n\nThanks: Armando\n\nReaders like you help support Android Police.
