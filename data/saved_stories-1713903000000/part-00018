As of publication, the company\u2019s\nadvisory still made no mention of the in-the-wild targeting. Windows users\nfrequently prioritize the installation of patches based on whether a\nvulnerability is likely to be exploited in real-world attacks.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s emergency patch fails to fix critical \u201cPrintNightmare\u201d\nvulnerability\n\nExploiting CVE-2022-38028, as the vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers\nto gain system privileges, the highest available in Windows, when combined\nwith a separate exploit. Exploiting the flaw, which carries a 7.8 severity\nrating out of a possible 10, requires low existing privileges and little\ncomplexity. It resides in the Windows print spooler, a printer-management\ncomponent that has harbored previous critical zero-days. Microsoft said at the\ntime that it learned of the vulnerability from the US National Security\nAgency.\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft revealed that a hacking group tracked under the name\nForest Blizzard has been exploiting CVE-2022-38028 since at least June\n2020\u2014and possibly as early as April 2019. The threat group\u2014which is also\ntracked under names including APT28, Sednit, Sofacy, GRU Unit 26165, and Fancy\nBear\u2014has been linked by the US and the UK governments to Unit 26165 of the\nMain Intelligence Directorate, a Russian military intelligence arm better\nknown as the GRU. Forest Blizzard focuses on intelligence gathering through\nthe hacking of a wide array of organizations, mainly in the US, Europe, and\nthe Middle East.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince as early as April 2019, Forest Blizzard has been exploiting\nCVE-2022-38028 in attacks that, once system privileges are acquired, use a\npreviously undocumented tool that Microsoft calls GooseEgg. The post-\nexploitation malware elevates privileges within a compromised system and goes\non to provide a simple interface for installing additional pieces of malware\nthat also run with system privileges. This additional malware, which includes\ncredential stealers and tools for moving laterally through a compromised\nnetwork, can be customized for each target.\n\n\u201cWhile a simple launcher application, GooseEgg is capable of spawning other\napplications specified at the command line with elevated permissions, allowing\nthreat actors to support any follow-on objectives such as remote code\nexecution, installing a backdoor, and moving laterally through compromised\nnetworks,\u201d Microsoft officials wrote.\n\nGooseEgg is typically installed using a simple batch script, which is executed\nfollowing the successful exploitation of CVE-2022-38028 or another\nvulnerability, such as CVE-2023-23397, which Monday's advisory said has also\nbeen exploited by Forest Blizzard. The script is responsible for installing\nthe GooseEgg binary, often named justice.exe or DefragmentSrv.exe, then\nensuring that they run each time the infected machine is rebooted.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n34\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
