It is\n> well known that by evaporating silicon from commercial electronics grade\n> silicon carbide crystals an epitaxial graphene layer forms on the surfaces\n> [2]. The first epigraphene layer to form on the silicon terminated face,\n> known as the buffer layer, is insulating. It is chemically bonded to the SiC\n> and spectroscopic measurements [3] have identified semiconducting signatures\n> on the microscopic domains. However, the bonding to the SiC is disordered\n> and the mobilities are small. Here we demonstrate a quasi-equilibrium\n> annealing method that produces macroscopic atomically flat terraces covered\n> with a well ordered epigraphene buffer layer that has a 0.6 eV bandgap. Room\n> temperature mobilities exceed 5000 cm2/Vs which is much larger than silicon\n> and 20 times larger than the phonon scattering imposed limit of current 2D\n> semiconductors. Critical for nanotechnology, its lattice is aligned with the\n> SiC substrate, it is chemically, mechanically, and thermally robust, and it\n> can be conventionally patterned and seamlessly connected to semimetallic\n> epigraphene making semiconducting epigraphene ideally suited for\n> nanoelectronics.\n\nComments:| Text and figures + supplemental information  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2308.12446 [cond-mat.mes-hall]  \n(or arXiv:2308.12446v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.12446arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Walt Deheer [view email] [v1] Wed, 23 Aug 2023 21:57:01 UTC (7,092 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Ultra-high mobility semiconducting epitaxial\ngraphene on silicon carbide, by Jian Zhao and 14 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncond-mat.mes-hall\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2308\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncond-mat\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
