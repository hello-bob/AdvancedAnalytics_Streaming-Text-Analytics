The Squarial was a flat plate satellite antenna,\nbuilt to be unobtrusive and unique. BSB were counting on the form factor of\nthe antenna to clearly differentiate themselves from their competitors at the\ntime. At the time of development, satellite installations usually required a\n90 cm dish in order to receive a clear signal from the transmitting satellite.\nThe smaller antenna was BSB's unique selling point and was heavily advertised\nin order to attract customers to their service.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe Squarial was launched at a high-profile event in Marco Polo House, BSB's\nheadquarters. The media were invited to a demonstration to see how much better\nMAC pictures could be than PAL. But MAC took a back seat when BSB unveiled the\nmock up Squarial, to replace the dish aerials usually needed for satellite\nreception. The Squarial was a surprise to everyone, including the four\ncompanies which had signed to manufacture the receivers which would have to\nwork with the new aerial. The Squarial deal, with British company Fortel, had\nbeen struck only hours before the London event. BSB was itself surprised at\nthe press reaction.\n\nThe media were apparently so excited by the new antenna that they failed to\nask whether there was a working prototype, and there wasn't. All that existed\nat this point was a wood-and-plastic dummy. Believing that someone would be\nable to make the Squarial work as well as a much larger dish, BSB built a\nwhole advertising campaign on the Squarial. STC in Paignton was the first\ncompany to make a British Squarial. These were a little bigger, 38 cm across,\nto provide adequate reception throughout the UK, and more expensive than a\ndish.^[citation needed] Due to production delays and limited availability of\nthe STC squarial and to save face at launch, BSB sourced already available\nSquarials from Matsushita (now called Panasonic) in Japan who were producing\nthem in quantity for the Japanese market. Industry rumours at the time of\nlaunch suggested that BSB were buying the squarials from Matsushita for\nseveral hundred pounds each and heavily subsidising the cost to the four\nmanufacturers of DMAC receiver. The Matsushita squarial was of a slightly\nbetter quality construction compared to the STC design and was used by\nFerguson, Philips and Tatung while ITT-Nokia supplied the STC squarial.\nHowever all offered the 30 cm traditional mini dish for a slightly lower price\n(several dish manufacturers were used including Lenson Heath and Channel\nMaster).\n\nThe Squarial became obsolete in 1993, when the Marcopolo satellites, which the\nSquarial received, stopped broadcasting signals from BSkyB, which had carried\nthe Sky channels over the D-Mac system for a period.\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\nA photo of all three BSB dishes available, the squarial, a Sky dish for\ncomparison, the round BSB dish, and the square BSB dish.\n\nUnlike a normal satellite dish, which uses a parabolic reflector to focus the\nradio waves on a single feed horn antenna, the Squarial was a phased array\nantenna, a common design in which multiple small antennas work together to\nreceive the waves.^[1] The Squarial consisted of a planar array of either 144\nor 256 resonant cavity antennas spaced 0.9 wavelength apart, all embedded in\nplastic. Each antenna element was a tiny open-ended metal box in which the\nmicrowave downlink radio waves excited standing waves, with a wire probe\nprojecting in which received the radio waves and conducted them to an integral\nlow-noise block converter (LNB) amplifier. The feed network combined the radio\ncurrents from the separate elements with the correct phase so that radio waves\nfrom the desired direction would be in phase and add together, while radio\nwaves from other directions would be out of phase and cancel.\n\nSince the microwaves had to pass through the plastic surface to reach the\nantennas, special low-loss plastic was used. Three of these plastic sheets\nwere stacked upon each other, padded with polystyrene layers to add rigidity\nto the unit. All this was engineered into a 38 cm white plastic body with the\nBSB logo at the bottom. The low-noise block converter mounted in the center,\nbehind the layers, was a standard unit similar to those in other satellite\ndishes, which converts the frequencies from the satellite down to a lower\nfrequency band around 800 MHz and transmits it through a coaxial cable into\nthe building to the set-top box at the TV. It was manufactured by Matsushita\nand rated as a 10 GHz standard unit.\n\nThe Squarial's small size was possible thanks to the high power of the two\nMarcopolo DBS satellites, which simulcast the same channels on the same\nfrequencies. The broadcast power was 59 dBW, with a 0.05 degree accuracy.^[2]\n\nManufacturers of the DMAC receivers used with the Squarial included, Ferguson,\nPhillips, Nokia and Tatung.\n\n## Modification[edit]\n\nThe Squarial was a specialized antenna designed specifically for operation on\nthe Marco Polo satellites' frequency range. The LNB could only tune a limited\nrange of frequencies and when utilised in modern circumstances the frequency\nis subsequently offset by around 100 MHz.\n\nSome owners modified the squarial to operate with the Thor satellite system\n(formerly BSB's own satellites, Marcopolo) after the decline of BSB. This was\ndue in large part to the highly discounted price of the unit during the final\nmonths of BSB's existence. D2-MAC programmes could be picked up from the\nScandinavian satellites during the early 1990s and viewed using modified\nreceivers. Once transmissions ceased from these satellites, Squarials could be\nused to receive broadcasts from the French terrestrial relay satellites at\n5.0\u00b0W.\n\nBSB's alternative dishes were also successfully used to receive analogue\ntransmissions from the Astra and Hot Bird satellites.\n\n## Design and brand[edit]\n\nBSB placed the Squarial at the heart of its advertising campaign, using the\ndiamond shape throughout all of its channel logos and on screen presentation.\nThis square/diamond image extended down to BSB's corporate logo and even\nprinted and televisual advertising mediums. This led to the company's slogan\n(used throughout the company's existence) \"It's smart to be square\".^[3]\n\nThe unique appearance was a design first for satellite antennae, its flat\nplate measured only a few millimetres thick and the LNB unit protruded another\n3 cm from the rear. It was built to a very high standard, featuring good\nquality plastics, weather resistant coatings and stainless steel mounting arm.\nCompared with the Amstrad-manufactured dishes offered by Sky \u2014 made from cheap\nmetal \u2014 the Squarial offered a much more attractive, upmarket appearance.\n\n## Alternatives[edit]\n\nBSB offered two alternatives to the squarial, the cheaper more conventional\nlooking mini-dish format and the rounded-rectangle format dish.\n\nThe first revision was in the shape of a vertical ellipse of roughly 30 cm in\ndiameter. The design employed a short LNB arm with a 'spike' design LNB\noperating at a frequency of 10 GHz. Essentially this design could be\nconsidered the forerunner to BSkyB's minidish. The second revision took on the\nappearance of a perfectly circular dish (around 25 cm in diameter), using a\nstandard LNB at 10 GHz. In essence both function like a normal satellite dish,\nonly scaled down.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Lewis, Geoffrey E. (2014).
