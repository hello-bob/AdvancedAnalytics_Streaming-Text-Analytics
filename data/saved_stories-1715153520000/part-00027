It\u2019s\nenough already.\u201d \u201cI want nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not unusual for technological innovation to be met with\ncriticism. Many scoffed at the iPhone when it first came on the market in\n2007. Skeptical of the iPhone\u2019s multiple functions, an Apple executive and\nfuture CEO of Palm asked, \u201cIs there a toaster that also knows how to brew\ncoffee?\u201d New technology is also frequently met with so-called \u201cmoral panics.\u201d\nIn the 1920s, for example, the New York Times worried that listening to the\nradio too much could make children sick because the body could not \u201cbe kept up\nat the jazz rate forever.\u201d\n\nBut much of the negativity about the Vision Pro is neither skepticism about\nits utility nor panic about its likely effects, but rather a wary\nresignation\u2014like that of a lab rat tired of all the experiments but aware it\nwon\u2019t be able to resist another bite of cheese. We mostly take it for granted\nthat digital technology comes with serious social and developmental drawbacks,\neven if these may not justify outright panic. As a result, most of us now look\non our devices and the industry that makes them with a kind of dependent\ncontempt. We\u2019ve become reliant on some of their functions and addicted to\nothers. We feel compelled to carry a trap around with us in our pockets.\n\nThe latest dubious convenience, suggested\u2014but still only suggested\u2014by the\nVision Pro, would integrate the trap directly into our visual field, relieving\nus of the burden of taking out a device and looking at it.\n\nIn essence, the Vision Pro is noise-cancelling headphones for your eyes. It\u2019s\na pair of virtual-reality goggles that uses eight outward-facing cameras to\ncapture and track external reality and re-present it to you. This\n\u201cpassthrough\u201d technology, like transparency mode on AirPods, allows you to\nsense and navigate the world with something approximating normal aptitude. It\nalso means that you can impose apps and windows from the Vision Pro\u2019s\noperating system on the \u201creal\u201d world outside the device. You can, in other\nwords, \u201caugment\u201d reality with the digital ghosts of your choice. A dial on the\ntop of the device allows you to fine-tune the immersion: all the way up and\nyou\u2019re completely in a virtual environment; all the way down and you\u2019re pretty\nmuch in the real world, just twelve milliseconds behind and with a pair of\nbulky metallic ski goggles strapped to your head. Meanwhile, the device\u2019s eye-\nand hand-tracking sensors allow you to navigate its apps and settings without\nany keyboards or controllers. Essentially, your eyes are a mouse cursor and\nyou click, scroll, and swipe through menus and apps with various hand\ngestures.\n\nIn full immersion, the device\u2019s performance is compelling. Photos and videos\nfeel uncomfortably real. At one point in the demo offered at Apple Stores,\nyou\u2019re placed inside a 3D home movie of a child\u2019s birthday party that is so\nlife-like it feels invasive. Slight constraints on peripheral vision still\nkeep you at a remove, but your body is telling you that you should be able to\nmove around these environments even if your brain knows you can\u2019t. Though\ntechnologically impressive, these experiences are at the same time lonely and\nalmost elegiac. You\u2019re inserted into a kind of lost world or memory that you\ncan\u2019t share with anyone else. There\u2019s also something creepy about them; they\nturn you into a paralyzed peeping Tom, lurking in a world you can\u2019t affect.\nOne shudders at the possibility of AI one day generating these worlds for us\non command.\n\nMuch of the negativity about the Vision Pro is neither skepticism about its\nutility nor panic about its likely effects, but rather a wary resignation.\n\nBut this kind of immersive virtual reality had already established itself as a\nproduct category before the Vision Pro, albeit a rather niche one. What the\nVision Pro has advanced, though not invented, is \u201cmixed\u201d or \u201caugmented\nreality\u201d (AR)\u2014Apple calls it \u201cspatial computing\u201d\u2014which allows users to\nintegrate various digital functions directly into their experience of the real\nworld. Apple is marketing the Vision Pro as a supercharged hybrid device\nmixing iPhone with computer with gaming console with movie theater. It can be\nused to get work done, Facetime with friends and family (as a video-game\nversion of yourself), guide you as you cook, and distract you while you\u2019re\nfolding clothes\u2014all without isolating you from the world and people around\nyou\u2014or so Apple tries to assure us. The Vision Pro even tries to create a\nsense of presence by projecting an image of your eyes onto the front of the\ndevice, which is as weird as it sounds.\n\nTo be fair, Apple is aware that this version of the technology is not ready\nfor widespread consumer adoption. The $3,500 price tag seems as much a way of\nkeeping it in the hands of developers and the tech-obsessed few as a\nreflection of its actual cost. Apple\u2019s strategy is instead to offer a proof of\nconcept\u2014to show that this field is viable, that Apple should now be considered\nits leader, and that AR developers should focus their talents on developing\nuseful applications for Apple\u2019s visionOS operating system. It is positioning\nitself for a future when the tech becomes better, cheaper, less obtrusive, and\nperhaps also capable of what\u2019s called \u201coptical AR\u201d\u2014which would integrate\nvirtual projections directly into our actual visual perception of the world\ninstead of a camera-mediated version of it (something more like Alphabet\u2019s\nfailed Google Glass).\n\nNone of these advances, however, will change the basic facts about a device\nthat is fundamentally isolating\u2014occluding certain aspects of the real world in\nfavor of a personalized \u201cme-world\u201d that can\u2019t be shared with others. It\u2019s\nfitting that you look like such an idiot while wearing it, since it\neffectively makes you into what the ancient Greeks called an \u201cidi\u014dt\u0113s,\u201d a\nprivate person incapable of participating in public life. \u201cSpatialized\ncomputing\u201d is another step in the effort, begun in earnest by the smartphone\nand earbuds (and echoed in the privatized politics of the neoliberal era), to\nmake public life more private.\n\nIn his magnum opus Being and Nothingness, the existentialist philosopher Jean-\nPaul Sartre offers two examples to try to illuminate the basic character of\nintersubjectivity. In the first, he describes the experience of being alone in\na park and suddenly seeing a man in the distance. The lawns and trees that\njust a moment ago were, in some sense, mine\u2014an environment that seemed to\npresent itself to me alone\u2014are now shared. I\u2019m aware of the man as a subject\nlike me, someone who also has a perceptual claim upon \u201cmy\u201d world. \u201cSuddenly an\nobject has appeared which has stolen the world from me,\u201d Sartre writes. \u201cIt\nappears that the world has a kind of drain hole in the middle of its being and\nthat it is perpetually flowing off through this hole.\u201d Importantly, seeing\nthis man as an object who is also a subject is irreducibly connected to the\nfact that I am both object and subject for him as well. For Sartre, my own\nsubjectivity is inextricably tied to my sense that he senses it.\n\nNone of these advances, however, will change the basic facts about a device\nthat is fundamentally isolating.\n\nThis comes through even more clearly in Sartre\u2019s second example. Here, I\u2019m\npeering through a keyhole and pressing my ear to a door to try to find out\nwhat\u2019s going on inside when I suddenly hear footsteps in the hall behind me.\nWithout even seeing the other person, I\u2019m suddenly and shamefully aware that I\nand my subjectivity have become an object for another person.\n\nSartre uses these examples to make two main points. One is to dissolve a\nphilosophical problem about the existence of other minds: How can I know for\nsure that other people are genuine subjects like me and not some kind of AI\nautomaton? Sartre turns the question on its head. He shows that its\npremise\u2014individual subjectivity\u2014already presumes the existence of other minds.\nI get a sense of my own subjectivity through the (sometimes distressing)\nawareness of others\u2019 subjectivity. In short, there is no subjectivity without\nintersubjectivity. Sartre\u2019s second, less convincing point is that\nintersubjectivity always involves an antagonism between perspectives. \u201cThe\nessence of the relations between consciousnesses,\u201d he writes, \u201cis conflict.\u201d\n\nIf Sartre is right about these ever-warring perspectives, the Vision Pro is a\nnew weapon in the fight. My world no longer needs to \u201cdrain away\u201d toward\nanother\u2019s person\u2019s world. I can mold reality to my own specifications and live\nin a world that is mine alone, inaccessible to anyone else. Meanwhile, the\nelements of our shared world can become mere items on a menu, to be ordered on\ndemand and forced to compete for my attention with virtual projections\nunburdened by physical constraints. No longer will we have to retreat to the\ncozy private worlds of our screens as a refuge against the public; we can now\nproject our own worlds directly onto the world out there, while still\nremaining secure in the fact that no one else can see them. We can, in effect,\nbecome unashamed peeping Toms, able to curate our view as we like with no fear\nof being exposed ourselves.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much imagination to foresee profoundly antisocial\nconsequences. The videos of early adopters who\u2019ve taken the Vision Pro out\nonto the street already offer some rudimentary indications: everyday\ninteractions are overrun by virtual dinosaurs and YouTube videos, while fellow\nhuman beings are turned into images on the same level as a Twitter feed. To a\ntroubling extent, the Vision Pro makes it possible to actualize a\nphilosophically mistaken understanding of what it means to be a human being.\n\nEarly critiques have tended to focus on the device\u2019s lack of utility. It\u2019s not\nclear what need this device actually serves. But this is a little like\ncriticizing heroin because it doesn\u2019t increase productivity. The tech\nindustry, ever since Apple helped reimagine its place in our lives with the\niPod and the iPhone, doesn\u2019t aim at utility exactly. It aims at\naddiction\u2014creating products so well attuned to human instinct and perception\nthat they become indispensable even if they seem, at least at first, as\nuseless as a coffee-brewing toaster.\n\nOf course, these devices seek to become indispensable not only so we buy them\nbut also so that, once we\u2019re captive to their \u201cecosystems,\u201d value can be\nsystematically scraped from us. For the tech industry, every instance of\nunmanipulated or untracked human attention represents lost value. Headsets\nlike the Vision Pro promise to help capture that value. They present\ndevelopers and advertisers with enticing new opportunities to track, steer,\nand monopolize our attention. If you think apps like TikTok and Instagram\nalready addle and addict their users, distort personalities and relationships,\nand violate privacy norms, imagine them in ever-present immersive 3D tracking\nyour every eye movement.\n\nThe Vision Pro may or may not be successful; it still has many hurdles to\nclear, both technologically and in terms of social acceptance. But it clearly\nsignals that the tech industry will keep trying to strip-mine human\nconsciousness for value no matter the consequences for individual well-being\nor the common good. This is technological innovation aimed not at satisfying\nour considered desires\u2014or even our basest impulses\u2014but at hijacking and\nexploiting our animal instincts.\n\nA stock phrase has emerged among the tech cheerleaders touting the Vision Pro:\n\u201cAnd just imagine,\u201d they marvel, \u201cthis is the worst this technology will ever\nbe.\u201d If only. I\u2019m afraid it will get much worse.\n\nAlexander Stern is Commonweal\u2019s features editor.\n\n##### Also by this author\n\n##### Biden & Bibi\n\nPlease email comments to letters@commonwealmagazine.org and join the\nconversation on our Facebook page.\n\nPublished in the May 2024 issue: View Contents\n\nTopics\n\nCulture\n\nTechnology\n\n  * ##### Previous Story\n\n##### The Invisible Owners\n\n  * ##### Next Story\n\n##### Distorting the Gospel\n\n#### Headfirst Downslide\n\nBy Carmen M.
