It now goes to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk to become law.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden \u201cwill swiftly\nsign the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the nick of time, we are reauthorizing FISA right before it expires at\nmidnight,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said when voting on final\npassage began 15 minutes before the deadline. \u201cAll day long, we persisted and\nwe persisted in trying to reach a breakthrough and in the end, we have\nsucceeded.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials have said the surveillance tool, first authorized in 2008 and\nrenewed several times since then, is crucial in disrupting terror attacks,\ncyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence\nthat the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing\nof al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nUS says a UN agency has agreed to help in distribution of aid to Gaza via sea\nroute\n\nSeeking \u2018the right side of history,\u2019 Speaker Mike Johnson risks his job to\ndeliver aid to Ukraine\n\nThe US attempts a new military deal with Niger in a last ditch effort to stay\n\n\u201cIf you miss a key piece of intelligence, you may miss some event overseas or\nput troops in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate\nIntelligence Committee, said. \u201cYou may miss a plot to harm the country here,\ndomestically, or somewhere else. So in this particular case, there\u2019s real-life\nimplications.\u201d\n\nThe proposal would renew the program, which permits the U.S. government to\ncollect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside\nthe country to gather foreign intelligence. The reauthorization faced a long\nand bumpy road to final passage Friday after months of clashes between privacy\nadvocates and national security hawks pushed consideration of the legislation\nto the brink of expiration.\n\nThough the spy program was technically set to expire at midnight, the Biden\nadministration had said it expected its authority to collect intelligence to\nremain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier\nthis month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives\nsurveillance applications.\n\nStill, officials had said that court approval shouldn\u2019t be a substitute for\ncongressional authorization, especially since communications companies could\ncease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse.\n\nHouse before the law was set to expire, U.S. officials were already scrambling\nafter two major U.S. communication providers said they would stop complying\nwith orders through the surveillance program, according to a person familiar\nwith the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private\nnegotiations.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland praised the reauthorization and reiterated\nhow \u201cindispensable\u201d the tool is to the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cThis reauthorization of Section 702 gives the United States the authority to\ncontinue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-U.S. persons\nlocated outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important\nreforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of\nAmericans\u2019 privacy and civil liberties,\u201d Garland said in a statement Saturday.\n\nBut despite the Biden administration\u2019s urging and classified briefings to\nsenators this week on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in\nprotecting national security, a group of progressive and conservative\nlawmakers who were agitating for further changes had refused to accept the\nversion of the bill the House sent over last week.\n\nThe lawmakers had demanded that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer allow votes on\namendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as\ncivil liberty loopholes in the bill. In the end, Schumer was able to cut a\ndeal that would allow critics to receive floor votes on their amendments in\nexchange for speeding up the process for passage.\n\nThe six amendments ultimately failed to garner the necessary support on the\nfloor to be included in the final passage.\n\nOne of the major changes detractors had proposed centered around restricting\nthe FBI\u2019s access to information about Americans through the program. Though\nthe surveillance tool only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also\ncollects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those\ntargeted foreigners. Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, had\nbeen pushing a proposal that would require U.S. officials to get a warrant\nbefore accessing American communications.\n\n\u201cIf the government wants to spy on my private communications or the private\ncommunications of any American, they should be required to get approval from a\njudge, just as our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution,\u201d\nDurbin said.\n\nIn the past year, U.S. officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes\nby FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for\ninformation about Americans or others in the U.S., including a member of\nCongress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan.\n6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nBut members on both the House and Senate intelligence committees as well as\nthe Justice Department warned requiring a warrant would severely handicap\nofficials from quickly responding to imminent national security threats.\n\n\u201cI think that is a risk that we cannot afford to take with the vast array of\nchallenges our nation faces around the world,\u201d Democratic Sen. Mark Warner,\nchair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Friday.\n\n## __\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker contributed to this report.\n\nFARNOUSH AMIRI\n\nFarnoush is a congressional reporter.\n\ntwitter\n\nmailto\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to\nfactual reporting.
