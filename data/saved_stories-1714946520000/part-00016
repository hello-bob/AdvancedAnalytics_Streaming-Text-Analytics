How do you cause people to\n> believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism?\n> First, you never admit that the order is imagined.\n>\n> \u2015 Yuval Noah Harari\n\nTake a minute to think of what a nation is. Let\u2019s say the United States of\nAmerica. What makes someone American? Is it their physique, genetic traits,\nfamily lineage, pheromones? No, it\u2019s a concept in their head, which stems from\na mix of identity, ideology, personal gains from abiding to that concept (say,\ngaining currency via a job or a company, that allows you to acquire things you\ndesire), perceived protection and support from peers because they believe you\nare commonly aligned on core beliefs / concepts.\n\nThe same can be said of a company. A company is not a physical being, it\u2019s a\nshared idea in our imagination. As Yuval mentions in Sapiens, Peugeot does not\nreally exist, except in our minds. It doesn\u2019t have a body, mind, anything. We\nhave the common belief that Peugeot exists, because we also have the common\nbelief of what a company means, we are aligned on how it should be represented\nand who can represent it, we recognize it as an entity with rights and duties,\nand which laws it should abide by.\n\nLaws, as well, are worth nothing if only one person believes in them. They are\npowerful because a large group of people believe in them, and they expect\nothers to do so as well. That\u2019s why we have courts, prisons, and educational\nsystems for that matter. They are ways to punish, format, and incentivise for\nthe entire group to have the required level of consistency, and keep rowing in\nthe same direction.\n\nThat\u2019s why complete anarchy loses its edge on a large scale. It extinguishes\nthe biggest thing Humans have going for them: the ability for large numbers of\npeople to rally in common goals, even though they don\u2019t know personally most\nof their fellow believers.\n\nAs N. K. Humphrey suggests, these ideas, behaviors, or styles that spread by\nmeans of imitation from person to person within a culture, also known as\nmemes, could even be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically.\nThe generational propagation of a meme outweighs the lifespan of the Human who\ncreated it, so in a way, \u201cwe are living inside the dreams of dead people\u201d, as\nYuval puts it.\n\nThat being said, how do we align on a common concept or belief?\n\n## Stories\n\nWe\u2019ve seen from above how powerful and valuable having a broad range of\nconcepts aligned within a group of people. They bring value to the whole, but\nalso to the individual.\n\nYou can force someone to abide to a given concept via force (coercion,\nblackmailing, etc), but since they see little value going on for them, they\ndon\u2019t have the incentive to grow that concept inside them, or to propagate\nthat concept to others\n\nStories however, allow you to describe a world to others that they can\ninterpret in their head, and they can see by themselves how it would benefit\nthem, and the ones around them. It\u2019s an information passage mechanism that\nallows Humans to communicate and agree on a given concept, and they are\neverywhere:\n\n  * Children\u2019s bedtime stories - notice how several of these transmit moral values, this is, expectations of how one should behave in a given situation to be in alignment with the overall grpup / society\n  * Novels, biographies, movies\n  * When interviewees tell you a story of their childhood, how they created their company, how they achieved X, what happened during their struggles, etc\n  * When a leader, such as a CEO, convinces others of their vision / story, and that future prospects that would derive from working in a certain direction\n  * When meeting someone, when you talk about your background and your goals\n  * When you sell you employee skills to an employers, giving a summary of your professional trajectory\n  * When politicians portray their vision on how they want to improve their nation\n  * The lore of a nation, tribe, family, and their laws / duties / rights\n\n### Being a good storyteller is a powerful skill\n\nAs a species, one of our biggest distinguishing factors is that we are able to\ngoal on highly abstract concepts that only exist in our minds, such as the\nconcept of a company, a nation, a mission, an ideology, an intellectual\nrelationship, the concept of money. As Yuval puts it, \u201cWe are the only species\nwith the ability to use language\u2014not just to describe things we can see,\ntaste, and touch, but also to invent stories about things that don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nA magical thing happens when a group of people interpret and value that\nconcept in the same way, and are highly aligned on it. Narrative is the first\nand most crucial step for leaders who want to solve big problems and shape the\nworld for the better. After all, a person can have the greatest idea in the\nworld, but if they fail to rally others to make that idea come alive, nothing\ngets done.\n\nPosted by Pedro Lopes May 5th, 2024\n\n\u00ab Banishing mobile phones from bedroom\n\n# Recent Posts\n\n  * Let me tell you a story\n  * Banishing mobile phones from bedroom\n  * Minimalist Onyx BOOX Note Air3 B/W Setup\n  * Musk's biography: why it's interesting\n  * Project Planning Framework\n\n# GitHub Repos\n\n  * Status updating...\n\n@lopespm on GitHub\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 - Pedro Lopes - Powered by Octopress.
