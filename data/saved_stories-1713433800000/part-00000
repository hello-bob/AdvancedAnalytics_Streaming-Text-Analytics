The U.S., he said,\nwould run the risk of following in the footsteps of Latin American cautionary\ntales like Argentina that saw their economies sink as their leaders embraced\nsimilarly populist policies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cArgentina was going to be one of those really successful natural resource\ncountries like Canada and New Zealand and Australia, and instead it lost 14\nzeros from its currency because of successive hyper inflations and suffered\nnearly a double digit number of defaults and became an angry and unsettled\nsociety,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the risk that\u2019s at stake here. And you know, it\u2019s\nworrying for me.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone critical difference\u201d Summers said, is that the \u201cworld order never\nhinged on Argentina and the world order does hinge on the United States of\nAmerica.\u201d\n\n### Know More\n\nSummers, who spent much of the Biden administration sounding warnings about\nconsumer prices, has been doing something of a victory lap in recent months as\ninflation has proven more stubborn than expected. He said he was still \u201ca bit\nmore worried than the consensus\u201d about the current direction of inflation,\nadding that he thought \u201cit was odd for the Fed to be holding out on the\nprospect that there\u2019d be seven cuts this year.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe also had some sharp words for the Biden administration, arguing it has \u201cnot\nbeen business friendly enough in its rhetoric and some of its actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSilly me, I think in a world of global competition and where we\u2019re competing\nwith China... when I first think of our large technology companies, I think of\nnational champions assuring American leadership, not rapacious monopolists\nthat need to be cut down to scale so they won\u2019t have a chance of competing\nagainst China,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite sticky inflation, he suggested the White House had enjoyed some major\neconomic success. \u201cA lot of the problems are not so much related to things\nthat are being done on an ongoing basis, but I do think if we had been more\nrestrained at the time of the stimulus, we would have had a more restrained\noutcome.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n", "frontpage": false}
