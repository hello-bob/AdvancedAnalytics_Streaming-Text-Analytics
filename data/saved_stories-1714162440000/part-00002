The second took\nplace days later, with the transplant of a genetically modified pig kidney and\nthe pig's thymus gland -- which makes white blood cells to help the immune\nsystem fight disease -- to help prevent rejection.\n\nThe patient is 54-year-old Lisa Pisano, from New Jersey, who was facing heart\nfailure and end-stage kidney disease, NYU Langone said Wednesday. Due to\nseveral chronic conditions, including being on dialysis, she was not a\ncandidate for a heart transplant or a kidney transplant, the hospital said.\n\n### MORE: 2 patients receive double-lung transplants due to rare 'flipped\norgans' condition\n\nAdditionally, Pisano has high levels of antibodies harmful to human tissue\nthat would make it difficult to find a match for a human kidney transplant,\naccording to the hospital. However, these antibodies were not harmful to gene-\nedited pig organs.\n\n\"All I want is the opportunity to have a better life,\" Pisano said in a\nstatement. \"After I was ruled out for a human transplant, I learned I didn't\nhave a lot of time left. My doctors thought there may be a chance I could be\napproved to receive a gene-edited pig kidney, so I discussed it with my family\nand my husband.\"\n\nLisa Pisano with granddaughter Olivia Pisano suffered from heart and\nkidne...Show more ---\n\nCourtesy Lisa Pisano and family\n\nThe NYU team says it believes this is the first documented case of a patient\nwith a mechanical heart pump receiving an organ transplant of any kind. What's\nmore, this is just the second case of a gene-edited pig kidney transplanted\ninto a living person, and the first with the thymus combined, according to the\nhospital.\n\nThe first case occurred last month when a surgical team at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital connected the pig kidney's blood vessels and ureter with\nthose of 62-year-old Richard Slayman, a man living with end-stage kidney\ndisease. The hospital has said he continues to recover well.\n\nPisano's two procedures were performed by separate surgical teams about nine\ndays apart. The first, on April 4, involved the surgical insertion of a device\ncalled a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which helps pump blood from\nthe lower left heart chamber to the rest of the body.\n\nNYU Langone says it typically is used in patients who are waiting for a heart\ntransplant or are ineligible to receive a transplant. The hospital added that\nPisano would only have days or weeks to live without the LVAD.\n\nAlthough end-stage kidney disease typically rules out patients from receiving\nan LVAD, the novel approach of using a gene-edited pig kidney helped get her\napproved for the procedure, according to doctors.\n\n### MORE: US records milestone 1 millionth organ transplant\n\n\"Without the possibility of a kidney transplant, she would not have been\neligible as a candidate for an LVAD due to the high mortality in patients on\ndialysis with heart pumps,\" said Dr. Nader Moazami, chief of the division of\nheart and lung transplantation and mechanical circulatory support for the\ndepartment of cardiothoracic surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who\nwas one of the doctors who performed the LVAD surgery\n\n\"This unique approach is the first time in the world that LVAD surgery has\nbeen done on a dialysis patient with a subsequent plan to transplant a kidney.\nThe measure for success is a chance at a better quality of life and to give\nLisa more time to spend with her family,\" Moazami continued.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n### She was too sick for a traditional transplant.

Studies have shown that\nremoving alpha-gal helps prevent rejection of xenotransplanted, or non-human,\norgans.\n\n\"By using pigs with a single genetic modification, we can better understand\nthe role one key stable change in the genome can have in making\nxenotransplantation a viable alternative,\" Dr. Robert Montgomery, who led the\ntransplant surgery and is chair of the department of surgery and director of\nthe NYU Langone Transplant Institute, said in a statement.\n\n\"Since these pigs can be bred and do not require cloning like more complex\ngene edits, this is a sustainable, scalable solution to the organ shortage. If\nwe want to start saving more lives quickly, using fewer modifications and\nmedications will be the answer,\" Montgomery said.\n\nDaughter Brittany Harvill and Lisa Pisano_1 Lisa Pisano, 54, has become\nth...Show more ---\n\nCourtesy Lisa Pisano and family\n\nPisano's two-step procedure required clearance by NYU Langone's institutional\nreview board and approval from the Food and Drug Administration under its\n\"compassionate use\" program, which often allows non-traditional methods to be\nused when a patient has a serious or life-threatening condition.\n\nThe xenotransplantation was performed on April 11 and Pisano continues to\nrecover well, the hospital said.\n\nLast year, researchers at NYU Langone Health in New York Cityconducteda two-\nmonth study of a genetically engineered pig kidney that had been transplanted\ninto a 58-year-old man who had been declared brain-dead, with his family's\nconsent. The team observed only mild rejection that required intensifying\nimmunosuppression medication to reverse it.\n\nExperts have expressed hope that being able to transfer animal organs into\nhuman patients will help the future of the organ supply.\n\nCurrently, more than 103,000 men, women and children are on the national\ntransplant waiting list, according to theHealth Resources and Services\nAdministration (HRSA), an agency of the Department of Health and Human\nServices. Each day, 17 people die waiting for a transplant and, every eight\nminutes, someone is added to the transplant list, according to the HRSA.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Stern, assistant professor in the department of surgery at NYU\nG...Show more ---\n\nJoe Carrotta for NYU Langone Health\n\nWhat's more, many donor organs -- including kidneys -- are needlessly\ndiscarded every year, research shows. If these types of transplants for\nkidneys prove to work and be safe -- this could one daymake dialysis\nunnecessary for the more than 500,000 people in the United States who require\nit to live, according to the National Kidney Foundation.\n\n\"It is incredible to consider the scientific achievements that have led to our\nability to save Lisa's life, and what we are endeavoring to do as a society\nfor everyone in need of a life-saving organ,\" Montgomery said.\n\nHowever, the edited animal organs bring up questions about if they will work\nlong term, if they are safe and if it is ethical raising animals for human\norgan transplantation.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n### She was too sick for a traditional transplant.
