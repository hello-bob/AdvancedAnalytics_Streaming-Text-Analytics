She spent 5 years covering\ntech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation\nreform.\n\nApr 22, 2024, 1:30 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nCath Virginia / The Verge | Photo from Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden faces the camera, casually dressed for a US president in khaki\nslacks and a quarter zip. He jovially answers a series of questions about the\nSuper Bowl happening that day: Chiefs or Niners? Jason Kelce or Travis Kelce?\nAnd finally: Trump or Biden?\n\n\u201cAre you kidding? Biden,\u201d the president says with a smile.\n\nThat video marked the presidential reelection campaigns\u2019 debut on TikTok, the\nmassively popular video app that\u2019s captured the attention of 170 million\nAmericans. As of April, the video has more than 10.5 million views.\n\nStill, just weeks after that launch, Biden would pledge to sign a bill that\ncould oust the app from the US unless it finds a way to separate from its\nChinese parent company in six months once it takes effect. As of Saturday,\nthat bill looks one step closer to becoming law, after it cleared the House a\nsecond time as part of a foreign aid package, making it more difficult for the\nSenate to ignore. The push comes from US policymakers\u2019 fears that ByteDance,\nwhich owns TikTok, could be compelled by the Chinese government to hand over\ndata on US users. TikTok has repeatedly said it does not store US user\ninformation in China.\n\n### Related\n\n  * TikTok ban: all the news on attempts to ban the video platform\n  * How the House quietly revived the TikTok ban bill before most of us noticed\n\nWhile TikTok users might be surprised by the incongruity, campaign\nprofessionals have mostly shrugged off the cognitive dissonance. To them,\nwhat\u2019s most important is being where their voters are. Even so, TikTok\u2019s\nprohibition on political ads and relative newness to the election scene means\nit\u2019s not yet indispensable for campaigns in the way that strongholds like\nFacebook are, after proving to be reliable for fundraising over several\ncycles.\n\nBut many strategists also still recognize opportunity \u2014 if limited \u2014 on the\nplatform, for as long as it exists in its current form. Bradley Tusk, a\nventure capitalist and political strategist, who served as Mike Bloomberg\u2019s\ncampaign manager in his 2009 mayoral race, compared candidates\u2019 attitudes\ntoward the TikTok ban to how they might treat proposals to amend campaign\nfinance laws.\n\n\u201cWhen you see proposals to change them, every member says, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll live by\nwhatever the rules are, but I\u2019m not going to unilaterally disarm until that\nhappens,\u2019\u201d says Tusk. \u201cSo I think every campaign that is using TikTok ... is\ngoing to use it until the day the platform goes away or changes hands or\nwhatever happens, if anything. But I think that no one is going to\npreemptively not use TikTok.\u201d\n\n### When policy conflicts with politics\n\nHypocrisy in politics is far from novel. But TikTok\u2019s passionate user base has\nbeen particularly vocal about candidates who voted for the TikTok bill and yet\nembrace the platform.\n\nTake North Carolina Rep. Jeff Jackson (D), who built a large following on\nTikTok discussing his thoughts on congressional news but rapidly lost 100,000\nof them after his vote for the bill that would force TikTok\u2019s divestment or\nelse ban it.\n\n\u201cWITHOUT TIKTOK YOUR NOTHING!!!,\u201d one TikToker commented at the time. His\nposts have been riddled with comments like a series of tomato emoji and \u201cHow\nmuch did they pay you to vote yes on the ban?\u201d Some comments seem to suggest\nthat Jackson\u2019s vote was swayed by money from the American Israel Public\nAffairs Committee (AIPAC), as some lawmakers have pointed with concern to\nwidespread pro-Palestinian messages on the app and suggested China could put\nits thumb on the scales of what messages American users see. After Jackson\ndeleted his video explaining his vote rationale, one viewer commented on\nanother video, \u201cdeleting it doesn\u2019t make what u did go away \ud83d\ude02 how\u2019s that aipac\nmoney?\u201d (Jackson\u2019s campaign received just $8,000 from AIPAC in the 2022 cycle,\naccording to OpenSecrets, and he\u2019s running for North Carolina attorney\ngeneral, rather than reelection to Congress, this go around.)\n\nTusk said he\u2019s not too worried \u2014 he thinks the loudest voices on TikTok are\nunlikely to be voters in the primaries anyway. Unless a candidate is truly in\na swing district where the fight comes down to the general election, primary\nvoters are really the ones congressional candidates are trying to reach, he\nsaid. \u201cIf I were that member of Congress, and I was getting all this shit from\npeople on TikTok, my assumption would be it doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest.\nIt\u2019s going to have no impact on my primary,\u201d Tusk said.\n\n\u201cEven though, arguably, as a statement of principle, if you voted to\neffectively ban it, you should not be using it, I can\u2019t imagine anybody\u2019s\ndoing that,\u201d he added.\n\nRep. Jackson\u2019s TikTok profile has three new videos since he voted on the\ndivest-or-ban bill, including an apology video for deleting the video that was\nposted immediately after the bill passed the House.\n\n\u201cIf campaigns see a benefit to it, I would be very surprised if they stopped\nusing it based on political climate\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not the first time candidates have had to grapple with the message\nthey could send by campaigning on a platform that they\u2019re simultaneously\nattacking in policy spaces. When the Cambridge Analytica data scandal came to\nlight in 2018, revealing that data from millions of Facebook profiles had been\nharvested without users\u2019 consent by a political analytics firm, campaigns\nstill relied heavily on the platform for their fundraising and messaging\nefforts. Although Facebook banned political advertising after the 2020\nelection, it lifted the ban only a year later, in time for the following\nelection cycle. Some political advertisers shifted spend from the platform in\nthe 2022 midterm elections, but many pointed to other reasons for the change,\nlike new privacy policies on the iPhone that made it harder to target users.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was a dent in political advertising [on Facebook] after\nCambridge Analytica,\u201d said Jon Jones, founder and CEO of advocacy firm\nRelation Agency, who served as the first digital strategist to Barack Obama\u2019s\n2008 presidential campaign. \u201cAs much discussion and debate that there was ...\nI didn\u2019t see any downtick in activity on the platforms for political\ncampaigns.\u201d\n\nJust as with Facebook then, Jones said that when it comes to TikTok, \u201cif\ncampaigns see a benefit to it, I would be very surprised if they stopped using\nit based on political climate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough political reality,\u201d said Eric Wilson, senior vice president at\nstrategic advisory firm Bullpen Strategy Group, who led the digital team for\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, \u201cwhere good policy\nand good politics conflict.\u201d\n\n### A partisan divide in incentives\n\nThe calculus can be different for different candidates \u2014 whether Republican or\nDemocrat or political newcomer versus incumbent.\n\nIncumbents, for instance, have an opportunity to grow TikTok audiences over\ntime and leverage them during campaign season. But political newcomers may not\nfind TikTok worthwhile, says Jones, the former Obama digital strategist. \u201cIf\nyou don\u2019t already have that TikTok audience built up, it is very hard to build\none up in time to take advantage of it before Election Day.\u201d\n\nBut more importantly, there\u2019s a partisan divide on what candidates have to\ngain from TikTok. Some of this is obvious: TikTok\u2019s user base skews young, and\nyounger Americans tend to be more liberal. Republicans can still reliably\nreach their base by advertising on cable and Facebook.\n\n\u201cFacebook is still the 300, 500-pound gorilla in terms of audience,\u201d says\nTyler Brown, founder of digital public affairs firm Hadron Strategies, who\npreviously worked as director of digital strategy at the Republican National\nCommittee. But Democrats, says Brown, who need to turn out all the voters they\nhad in 2020, can\u2019t afford to pass up on opportunities.\n\nWilson agreed but also said there\u2019s some compelling evidence that Republican\nvoters are on TikTok. He said that based on a survey through his Center for\nCampaign Innovation in 2022, \u201cabout one in five MAGA Republicans were using\nthe TikTok platform.\u201d\n\n### Campaign strategists weigh their options\n\nThe reality is that despite TikTok\u2019s enormous reach and particular pull with\nyoung users, it is nowhere near the indispensable tool that Meta has become\nfor political campaigns. TikTok\u2019s prohibition on political advertising can\nmake it less attractive to campaigns, who operate with limited resources and\ngenerally prefer to stick to tried and true methods they know will result in\ncampaign dollars or voter turnout. Plus, having a full-fledged TikTok strategy\ndoesn\u2019t feel top priority to many campaign professionals when they know many\nof the same users are still using other platforms, too.\n\n\u201cWhile TikTok continues to have such a high number of users, the audiences\nthat are on TikTok are already very much online on other platforms as well,\u201d\nexecutive director of progressive group Priorities USA Danielle Butterfield\nsaid in an email to The Verge. Butterfield cited the group\u2019s internal research\non likely voters in battleground states, which found that even among\nrespondents who reported using TikTok more than any other platform in the last\nweek, 71 percent also used YouTube, 76 percent used Facebook, 62 percent used\nInstagram and 46 percent used Snapchat.\n\nEven so, campaign veterans shudder at the idea of leaving votes on the table\nby failing to take advantage of a large platform available to reach their\nbase.\n\n\u201cThe signal it sends if you\u2019re not [on TikTok] is bad, which is, you\u2019re old,\nyou\u2019re out of touch\u201d\n\nAmy Kelleher, senior director at progressive strategic communications agency\nBully Pulpit International, says that while it\u2019s an option for campaigns to\nleave access to the TikTok audience on the table, \u201cin most cases, it does\ncampaigns a disservice.\u201d She added that despite its reputation as being\npopular with Gen Z, many other groups of voters also show up on the platform,\nincluding Millennials and Gen Xers. TikTok is where Kelleher says she sees \u201ca\nlot of initial focal points of the election happening.\u201d\n\nTusk said that even if some campaigns don\u2019t really care to invest in TikTok,\n\u201cthe signal it sends if you\u2019re not [on the platform] is bad, which is, you\u2019re\nold, you\u2019re out of touch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe campaigns that I\u2019ve run, the thesis is: just do everything you can on\nevery single front you can imagine,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how you win. You\ndon\u2019t leave a stone unturned if you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nTo Wilson, the former Rubio digital operative, using TikTok as a campaign tool\nwhile opposing its ownership structure ultimately isn\u2019t all that different\nfrom advertising on any other platform a candidate generally disagrees with.\n\u201cYou may not like MSNBC, but sometimes you need to run ads there,\u201d Wilson\nsays. (On the other hand, no one in Congress is accusing MSNBC of being a tool\nof the Chinese Communist Party or is trying to ban government employees from\nwatching MSNBC.)\n\nIn the end, the mixed messaging being sent by voting one way on TikTok and\nthen continuing to campaign on the platform isn\u2019t deterring politicians from\ndoing exactly that. \u201cThe upside of the fact that opinions of Congress and\nWashington are so low is that no one expects them to be anything other than\nhypocrites,\u201d reflected Tusk.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## The little smart home platform that could\n\n  2. ## Why is Windows 11 so annoying?\n\n  3. ## The future of AI gadgets is just phones\n\n  4. ## This is Tesla\u2019s riveting fix for recalled Cybertruck accelerator pedals\n\n  5. ## The invisible seafaring industry that keeps the internet afloat\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from this stream TikTok ban: all the news on attempts to ban the video\nplatform\n\n  * ### TikTok \u2018ban\u2019 passes in the House again, moving to the Senate in foreign aid package\n\nApr 20, 2024, 5:25 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Apple ordered to remove WhatsApp, Threads, Signal, and Telegram from the App Store in China.\n\nApr 19, 2024, 4:31 AM UTC\n\n  * ### TikTok\u2019s infamous algorithm and its link to a failed real estate app.\n\nApr 18, 2024, 10:34 PM UTC\n\n  * ### TikTok divest-or-ban legislation could suddenly be fast-tracked in the Senate\n\nApr 18, 2024, 4:00 PM UTC\n\nSee all 102 stories\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
