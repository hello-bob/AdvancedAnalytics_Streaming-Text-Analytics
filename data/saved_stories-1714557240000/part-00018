What does this mean in practice?\n\nFirstly, all of the app\u2019s functions have been simplified and placed into more\nintuitive groupings. Secondly, the redesign better surfaces and explains all\nof the app\u2019s features. Finally, we\u2019ve also focused on making advanced\nfeatures, like Custom Rule creation, more accessible. Read on to see how this\nwas achieved.\n\n### Exploring the challenges\n\nIn the 4 years since our last major visual change to Magic Lasso, the app has\ngrown and evolved considerably. Many new features have been added such as\nYouTube ad blocking, Custom Rule creation and Adblock Performance Insights.\n\nWhile valuable, each of these additions were layered onto the existing user\ninterface. Whenever a new feature was added, design challenges kept arising.\nWhere should the new feature be placed in the existing top-level groupings?\nHow could it fit elegantly on the currently designed screens?\n\nParallel implementations were also required across two different UI\nframeworks. Once for the iPhone and iPad that utilised UIKit and once again\nfor the Mac app that utilised AppKit.\n\nThe end result was an app that was slowly becoming more complex, requiring\nincreased engineering time and slowing delivery of improvements to end-users.\nWith this technical and design debt, the rationale for a redesign was clear.\n\n### Powerfully simple\n\nFrom the start of the re-design process, we knew that we wanted to retain and\nlean-in to the app\u2019s existing design values. Despite the redesign, Magic Lasso\nshould continue to feel like an \u201cad blocker made for you\u201d. An ad blocker that\nis easy to setup, easy to keep up to date and with Pro features available if\nyou need them.\n\nIt should be simple for new users to quickly dive in. The new UI should also\nhelp to surface more advanced functionality, irregardless of a user\u2019s\ntechnical know-how.\n\nWith the redesign, everyone should be able to see how easy it is to block\nannoying elements on a page with Tap to Block. Or, view the amount of energy\nand carbon reduction that using an ad blocker delivers.\n\nAll of this was summed up by the \u201cpowerfully simple\u201d mantra that became our\nredesign\u2019s goal and north star.\n\n### Key design highlights\n\nThe easiest way to see the new redesign is to experience it yourself.\nNevertheless we\u2019ve touched on some of the key improvements that have been made\nin the redesign below.\n\n#### See the difference ad blocking makes\n\nWith Insights, in the updated Overview, you can easily see the data and energy\nsaved, along with the average speed increase and total number of ads blocked\nsince you enabled Magic Lasso. Insights on the Overview tab supplements\nPerformance Insights which may be viewed for each individual site via the\nMagic Lasso Safari toolbar button.\n\n#### Simplified ad, tracker and annoyance blocking\n\nIt\u2019s now even easier to specify which ads, trackers and annoyances are blocked\nby Magic Lasso. The redesigned Rules tab shows each option clearly, with a\nsimple toggle to enable or disable the feature.\n\n#### Customise rules your way\n\nCreate your own custom rules to allow or block JavaScript, Media, Cookies and\npage elements. And with Tap to Block, you can simply tap any element on a web\npage and watch it disappear from your view, ensuring it never disturbs your\nbrowsing again.\n\n#### Faster future improvements\n\nUnder the covers, Magic Lasso has been re-architected using SwiftUI which\nenables a shared but tailored UI implementation across the iPhone, iPad and\nMac apps.\n\nThe move to SwiftUI delivers improved user accessibility including complete\nsupport for variable type sizing and Dark mode. In the future, multilingual\nsupport will also be considerably easier to rollout.\n\nOver 95% of the app\u2019s UI is now written in SwiftUI, an increase from less than\n30% this time last year. Using SwiftUI also means new UI features will now\nhave to be implemented only once, removing the need for separately built iOS\nand macOS implementations.\n\n### Thoughts and feedback\n\nFrom the very start of building Magic Lasso, we\u2019ve been open to hearing from\nour users. Feedback, both negative and positive, is the wisdom that keeps an\napp like ours improving.\n\nWith the new design we hope existing users appreciate the improvements that\nhave been delivered. For new users, we hope it helps them to more easily\nexperience the benefits of ad blocking.\n\nEither way, feel free to send us an email with your thoughts. Let us know what\nyou like or perhaps don\u2019t like about the redesign. Also, if you\u2019re interested\nin posts like this, you might want to explore further with our Magic Lasso\nAdblock Year in Review series of posts from 2018 or 2023.\n\nAnd, if you\u2019ve never used an ad blocker on your iPhone, iPad or Mac you may\nwant to give Magic Lasso Adblock a try. It\u2019s the best way to see the redesign\nyourself and experience a cleaner, faster web \u2013 withouts ads.\n\n## Insights\n\nThoughts on privacy, tracking and advertising on the internet.\n\n#### View all insights\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Improvements to YouTube ad blocking\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Digital Advertising May Be Causing Almost 2% of Global Carbon Emissions\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Introducing Adblock Performance Insights\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Introducing Tap to Block, Custom Rules and Strict Mode\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Magic Lasso Adblock 2023 Year in Review\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Apple Should End Their Google Search Partnership\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Safari's Dangerous Defaults\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Is Chrome the new IE?\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### The Triumph of Safari\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### The Tragedy of Safari\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Introducing best in class YouTube ad blocking\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Magic Lasso: Adblock that doubles your battery life\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Introducing Magic Lasso Adblock 2.0\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### \u201cHey Google, stop tracking me\u201d\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Is advertising immoral?\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Google\u2019s attempts to undermine ad blockers\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### What difference does an adblocker really make?\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Magic Lasso Adblock 2018 Year in Review\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Why use an adblocker?\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### The problem with internet ads and the inevitable rise of adblocking\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n## Stay up-to-date\n\nSign-up to our newsletter to receive special offers, news and insights.\n\n###### Magic Lasso Adblock\n\n###### Why Magic Lasso?\n\n###### Features\n\n###### Insights\n\n###### Download Magic Lasso\n\n###### Adblock for iPhone\n\n###### Adblock for iPad\n\n###### Adblock for Mac\n\n###### Support\n\n###### Twitter\n\n###### Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
