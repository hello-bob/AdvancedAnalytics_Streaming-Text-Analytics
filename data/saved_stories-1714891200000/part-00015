Asked why he\nlisted that amount, the report says he told investigators: \u201cI just randomly\nput it in to see what I could get; I wanted to try my business again and\nwanted to go mobile with it.\u201d\n\nAnother DHS employee who claimed to have six-figure income from a beauty salon\nbusiness later told investigators she had only ever made $20 to $40 per month\ndoing hair for friends and family and did not consider it a business.\n\nThe woman told investigators she \u201cdid what everyone else was doing at the time\nin order to get money,\u201d the IG reports said. \u201cShe said that she did not use\nloan proceeds for any kind of business expenses because she does not have any\nbusiness expenses.\u201d\n\nThose cases are two of the 275 instances in which the inspector general found\nPPP wrongdoing, the alleged thefts totaling more than $7 million in public\nfunds, according to the IG\u2019s April newsletter. Department of Human Services\nemployees accounted for 175 of those cases. The Department of Corrections was\nthe next highest, with 31 cases.\n\nWhile the state IG provided updates on PPP investigations last year, the\nspecifics of the alleged fraud weren\u2019t made public until the state\u2019s Executive\nEthics Commission in recent weeks published about a dozen reports \u2014 all except\none regarding Department of Human Services\u2019 workers \u2014 detailing how they say\nstate employees fraudulently received loans of $20,000 or more.\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nPLAYTop Stories 01:00 Video Settings Full Screen About ConnatixV477139 Former\nChicago Bears QB Bob Avellini, who helped theteam make the playoffs in 1977,\nhas died at 70\n\nAll employees in these cases were later fired, according to records posted by\nthe ethics commission.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office refers cases with alleged loss greater than\n$5,000 to the Illinois attorney general\u2019s office for possible further action,\nsaid Neil Olson, general counsel at the OEIG. The AG can launch its own\ncriminal investigation or pass the cases to a state\u2019s attorney or federal\nprosecutors, he said.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office is reviewing all of the referrals it receives\nand several investigations have been opened, spokesperson Jamey Dunn-Thomason\nsaid in an email.\n\n\u201cAttorney General (Kwame) Raoul is committed to holding accountable\nindividuals who viewed the COVID pandemic as an opportunity for personal\nenrichment,\u201d Dunn-Thomason said, while declining to comment further on pending\ninvestigations.\n\nWhile state agencies have \u201cconsistently\u201d followed the inspector general\u2019s\nrecommendations to fire workers accused of PPP fraud, the process for\nterminating state employees can be lengthy, Olson said.\n\nSince the federal pandemic-era program took effect, many government employees\nhave been linked to PPP fraud. Cook County\u2019s independent watchdog last year\nfound more than a dozen county employees fraudulently obtained federal\npandemic loans, intended to keep small businesses afloat. And dozens of\nemployees of Cook County Clerk Iris Martinez resigned or were fired amid a PPP\nfraud probe last year, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.\n\nThe program was often misused, as were other pandemic-era efforts to quickly\ndisperse financial relief. A report from the U.S. Small Business\nAdministration\u2019s inspector general last year said some $64 billion in PPP\nloans may have been improperly doled out nationwide.\n\nA Department of Human Services spokesperson in a statement emphasized that\nemployees have been terminated over the inspector general\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cWhile the vast majority of IDHS\u2019 roughly 14,000 state employees are hard-\nworking people of strong character who work tirelessly to help the most\nvulnerable, it is deeply concerning any time an employee takes advantage of\npublic programs,\u201d spokesperson Daisy Contreras said in an email.\n\nSeveral of the 13 state employees on whom investigative reports have been made\npublic said they paid an outside individual to fill out the PPP application\nforms on their behalf. All claimed they had close to $100,000 in small\nbusiness income to appear eligible for loans of about $20,000, according to\nthe inspector general\u2019s investigative reports.\n\nIn each case, \u201cthe OEIG determined that there was reasonable cause to believe\u201d\nthe employee had violated state and agency rules \u201cby obtaining PPP loans based\non falsified information,\u201d according to the office.\n\nMany said they used the money for everyday expenses such as food and gas, the\nreports said. Other employees told the watchdog they spent the money on\nexpenses related to a business, but admitted their businesses earned only a\nfraction of the money they claimed on their PPP application forms.\n\nAn employee of the state\u2019s Department of Healthcare and Family Services who\nreceived a $20,000 loan for a beauty salon later told investigators that\nbusiness was fictitious, according to an OEIG report. Another employee who\nreceived a loan of about the same size told OEIG she had thought about\nstarting a hair-braiding business, but never did.\n\nYet another state employee, who said she paid a friend to fill out an\napplication on her behalf, received a $20,000 loan for a \u201clivestock merchant\nwholesaler\u201d business and later said she didn\u2019t know where the information on\nthe application came from, a report said. This employee also received a\nsecond, smaller PPP loan for a part-time babysitting business, which she told\ninvestigators was real.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker last year signed a law to extend the statute of limitations\nfor theft and fraud prosecutions related to COVID-19 relief.\n\nFBI Special Agent David Nanz, who is in charge of the bureau\u2019s Springfield\noffice, said last June that the scope of fraud involving pandemic stimulus\nmoney is likely massive.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest theft of money in the history of the world,\u201d Nanz said.\n\u201cThere is nothing that comes close when you look at all of the programs under\nthe CARES Act,\u201d he added, referring to the federal legislation that included\nthe PPP program.\n\nSeveral state employees also violated rules on disclosing secondary\nemployment, the OEIG found.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the ease of procuring these PPP funds, this was not free money\nfor the taking,\u201d the OEIG said. \u201cThese loans, as with any other, required\ntruthful information as a basis for approval.\u201d\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share a free article with a friend\n\n###### GIFT THIS ARTICLE\n\n###### What is article sharing?\n\nSubscribers are entitled to 10 gift sharing articles each month.
