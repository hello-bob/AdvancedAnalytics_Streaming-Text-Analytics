By combining several of these images, the authors were able\nto observe atoms behaving like waves. (Image credit: Verstraten et al.)\n\nFor the first time ever, physicists have captured a clear image of individual\natoms behaving like a wave.\n\nThe image shows sharp red dots of fluorescing atoms transforming into fuzzy\nblobs of wave packets and is a stunning demonstration of the idea that atoms\nexist as both particles and waves \u2014 one of the cornerstones of quantum\nmechanics.\n\nThe scientists who invented the imaging technique published their findings on\nthe preprint server arXiv, so their research has not yet been peer reviewed.\n\n\"The wave nature of matter remains one of the most striking aspects of quantum\nmechanics,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. They add that their new\ntechnique could be used to image more complex systems, giving insights into\nsome fundamental questions in physics.\n\nFirst proposed by the French physicist Louis de Broglie in 1924 and expanded\nupon by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger two years later, wave particle duality states that\nall quantum-sized objects, and therefore all matter, exists as both particles\nand waves at the same time.\n\nRelated: Tweak to Schr\u00f6dinger's cat equation could unite Einstein's relativity\nand quantum mechanics, study hints\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's famous equation is typically interpreted by physicists as\nstating that atoms exist as packets of wave-like probability in space, which\nare then collapsed into discrete particles upon observation. While bafflingly\ncounterintuitive, this bizarre property of the quantum world has been\nwitnessed in numerous experiments.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nTo image this fuzzy duality, the physicists first cooled lithium atoms to\nnear-absolute zero temperatures by bombarding them with photons, or light\nparticles, from a laser to rob them of their momentum. Once the atoms were\ncooled, more lasers trapped them within an optical lattice as discrete\npackets.\n\nWith the atoms cooled and confined, the researchers periodically switched the\noptical lattice off and on \u2014 expanding the atoms from a confined near-particle\nstate to one resembling a wave, and then back.\n\nA microscope camera recorded light emitted by atoms in the particle state at\ntwo different times, with atoms behaving like waves in between. By putting\ntogether many images, the authors built up the shape of this wave and observed\nhow it expands with time, in perfect agreement with Schr\u00f6dinger's equation\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014Otherworldly 'time crystal' made inside Google quantum computer could change\nphysics forever\n\n\u2014China claims fastest quantum computer in the world\n\n\u2014Bizarre particle that can remember its own past created inside quantum\ncomputer\n\n\"This imaging method consists in turning back on the lattice to project each\nwave packet into a single well to turn them into a particle again \u2014 it is not\na wave anymore,\" study co-author Tarik Yefsah, a physicist at the French\nNational Centre for Scientific Research and the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in\nParis, told Live Science. \"You can see our imaging method as a way to sample\nthe wavefunction density, not unlike the pixels of a CCD camera.\" A CCD camera\nis a common type of digital camera that uses a charge-coupled device to\ncapture its images.\n\nThe scientists say this image is just a simple demonstration. Their next step\nwill be using it to study systems of strongly interacting atoms that are less\nwell understood.\n\n\"Studying such systems could improve our understanding of strange states of\nmatter, such as those found in the core of extremely dense neutron stars, or\nthe quark-gluon plasma that is believed to have existed shortly after the Big\nBang,\" Yefsah said.\n\nBen Turner\n\nStaff Writer\n\nBen Turner is a U.K. based staff writer at Live Science.
