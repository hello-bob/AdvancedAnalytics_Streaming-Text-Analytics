With the v0.0.26 release, ten more tests from\nthe GNU Test Suite for Coreutils is passing -- now at a 72.3% pass rate. Six\nfewer tests are also being skipped over but a failure increase of four for\nthis new version.\n\nIn addition to chipping away at better GNU Coreutils compatibility, the\nv0.0.26 release also starts working on AIX platform support, automated builds\nof new releases, and various other changes.\n\nDownloads and more details on the uutils Coreutils 0.0.26 release via GitHub.\n\n20 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nServo Web Engine Now Passing Acid2 Layout Engine Test\n\nSovereign Tech Fund Makes New Investments Into GNOME & PHP, Bug Bounty For\nsystemd\n\nLlamafile 0.8 Releases With LLaMA3 & Grok Support, Faster F16 Performance\n\nNginx 1.26 Released With Experimental HTTP/3 Support\n\nTow-Boot 2023.07 U-Boot Distribution Released With New Board Support\n\nValkey Celebrates Its First Stable Release As Open-Source Redis Fork\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
