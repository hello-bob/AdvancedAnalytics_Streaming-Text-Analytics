As we kneel\nbefore the altar of the \"ha ha, you can't control what your documents look\nlike in HTML\" philosophy, you, dear sinner (nay, blasphemer), can but take\nsolace in the fact that Mosaic is putting a blank line at the start of all\ntoplevel lists, including yours, entirely on purpose. (Why? Primarily because\nwe thought that looked the best for most documents on the Web at the time, as\nI remember.)\n\nWhat can you do about it? Probably nothing. Isn't that cheery news? I think\nso. In fact, it has been a constant source of delight for me over the past\nyear to get to continually tell hordes (literally) of people who want to --\nstrap yourselves in, here it comes -- control what their documents look like\nin ways that would be trivial in TeX, Microsoft Word, and every other common\ntext processing environment: \"Sorry, you're screwed.\"\n\nAh well, live and learn. Or not.\n\nCheers, Marc\n\n    \n    \n    -- Marc Andreessen Enterprise Integration Technologies Palo Alto, California marca@eit.com\n\n  * Next message: Stefan Karlsson: \"Re: Please, NO !!!! 8-o\"\n  * Previous message: Paul : \"Indented <MENU>s\"\n  * Next in thread: dolesa@smtp-gw.spawar.navy.mil: \"Re: Indented <MENU>s\"\n\n", "frontpage": false}
