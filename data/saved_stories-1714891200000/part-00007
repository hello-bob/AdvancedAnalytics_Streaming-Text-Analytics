Here are some examples of jobs scams and advice on how to avoid\nthem.\n\n  * Examples of Job Scams\n  * How To Avoid a Job Scam\n  * Advice on Finding a Job\n  * What To Do If You Paid a Scammer\n  * Report Job Scams to the FTC\n\n> Looking for a business opportunity?

Scammers know this, so\nthey place ads, often online, claiming that they have jobs where you can make\nthousands of dollars a month working from home with little time and effort.\nThe job could be anything from reshipping products to selling things to people\nyou know. Sometimes the scammers try to get you interested by saying that you\ncan be your own boss, start your own business, or set your own schedule.\n\nBut instead of making money, you end up paying for starter kits, so-called\ntraining, or certifications that are useless. You might also find that your\ncredit card is charged without your permission, or you get caught up in a fake\ncheck scam, where you deposit a check from your new employer, the employer\nthen asks you to send some money back due to \u201coverpayment,\u201d but the check will\nultimately bounce, and the bank will want you to repay the full amount of the\nfake check, while the scammers keep the real money you sent them.\n\nIf someone offers you a job and claims that you can make a lot of money in a\nshort period of time with little work, that\u2019s almost certainly a scam.\n\nHere are some examples of work-from-home job scams:\n\n  * Reshipping scams. If you\u2019re searching for a job online, you might see positions advertised for quality control managers or virtual personal assistants that have been placed by scammers. But here\u2019s how you can tell it\u2019s a reshipping scam: once you\u2019re \u201chired,\u201d the company says that your \u201cjob\u201d is to receive packages at home, throw away the original packaging and receipts, repackage the products, and then reship them to an address they give you.\n\nSometimes the address is overseas. The products are often high-priced goods,\nlike name-brand electronics, bought using stolen credit cards. Reshipping\ngoods is never a real job. That\u2019s simply being part of a scam. Sometimes the\ncompany tells you it will send your first paycheck after you work for a month,\nbut the paycheck never arrives. And when you try to contact the company,\nyou\u2019ll find that the phone number is often no longer connected and the website\nis deactivated. This \u201cjob\u201d is a scam, and if you gave your personal\ninformation thinking it was for payroll, you may now have an identity theft\nproblem.\n\n  * Reselling merchandise scams. In this scam, you may get a call out of the blue from a stranger offering you a job opportunity. Or you may see an ad online or in your local newspaper. They say you can make money buying brand-name luxury products for less than retail prices, and resell those products for a profit. But after you pay for the products, the package never arrives or, if it does, it\u2019s usually junk.\n\n### Nanny, caregiver, and virtual personal assistant job scams\n\nScammers post fake job ads for nannies, caregivers, and virtual assistants on\njob sites. Or they may send emails that look like they\u2019re from someone in your\ncommunity. The message might also seem to come from someone who is part of an\norganization you know, like your college or university. If you apply, the\nperson who hires you might send you a check. They\u2019ll tell you to deposit the\ncheck, keep part of the money for your services, and send the rest to someone\nelse. That\u2019s a scam. A legitimate employer will never ask you to do that. The\ncheck is fake and will bounce, and the bank will want you to repay the full\namount of the fake check, while the scammer keeps the real money you sent\nthem. So: if you get an offer that includes depositing a check and then using\nsome of the money for any reason, that\u2019s a scam. Walk away.\n\n### Mystery shopper scams\n\nGetting paid to shop sounds like a dream job \u2014 especially if you\u2019re going to\nschool full-time or looking for a side job. But while some mystery shopping\njobs are honest, many are scams. Honest mystery shopping companies won\u2019t ask\nyou to pay for certifications, directories of jobs, or job guarantees. If\nsomeone asks you to pay to get a job, that\u2019s a scam. And if they want you to\ndeposit a check and send money back, stop. That\u2019s a sign of a fake check scam.\nRead Mystery Shopping Scams to learn more.\n\n### Job placement service scams\n\nWhile many staffing agencies, temporary agencies, headhunters, and other\nplacement firms may deliver honest job search services, others lie about what\nthey will do for you, promote outdated or fake job openings, and charge fees\nfor so-called services. Honest placement firms do not typically charge a fee\nto job candidates. Instead, the hiring company pays them a fee to find\nqualified candidates. If a placement firm asks you for a fee \u2014 especially one\nyou have to pay in advance \u2014 walk away. You\u2019re probably dealing with a scam.\n\n### Government and postal jobs scams\n\nInformation about job openings with the federal government or U.S. Postal\nService is free and available to everyone. And it\u2019s always free to apply for a\nfederal or postal job. Never respond to an ad that promises jobs with the\nfederal government or postal service. And don\u2019t pay a fee to get the job.\nThose are scams. Use official government websites to find and apply for a job\nwith the federal government at USAJobs.gov, or visit usps.com/employment to\nfind jobs with the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n## How To Avoid a Job Scam\n\nBefore you accept a job offer, take these steps to avoid common job scams:\n\n  * Search online. Look up the name of the company or the person who\u2019s hiring you, plus the words \u201cscam,\u201d \u201creview,\u201d or \u201ccomplaint.\u201d See if others say they\u2019ve been scammed by that company or person. No complaints? It doesn\u2019t guarantee that a company is honest, but complaints can tip you off to possible problems.\n\n  * Talk to someone you trust. Describe the offer to them. What do they think? This also helps give you vital time to think about the offer.\n  * Don't pay for the promise of a job. Honest employers, including the federal government, will never ask you to pay to get a job. Anyone who does is a scammer.\n  * Never bank on a \u201ccleared\u201d check. No honest potential employer will ever send you a check to deposit and then tell you to send on part of the money, or buy gift cards with it. That\u2019s a fake check scam. The check will bounce, and the bank will want you to repay the amount of the fake check.\n\n## Advice on Finding a Job\n\nWhen you\u2019re searching for a job, start with safe and reliable sources:\n\n  * USAJobs.gov \u2014 This is the federal government\u2019s official site with job openings nationwide.\n  * CareerOneStop \u2014 Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, CareerOneStop lists hundreds of thousands of jobs.
