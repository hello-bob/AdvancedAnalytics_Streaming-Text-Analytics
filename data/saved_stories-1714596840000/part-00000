Altman\n\nJoe Rosenberg, a keen observer of financial markets and the longtime chief\ninvestment officer at Loews, died Monday at 91.\n\nRosenberg, who was born in Eschwege, Germany, and emigrated to the U.S. in\n1939, spent more than 50 years on Wall Street, most of them at Loews, the\nconglomerate controlled by the Tisch family.\n\nRosenberg\u2019s relationship with Barron\u2019s went back to 1963, when he contributed\nan opinion article on Trans World Airlines that resulted in a jump in the\nstock. He was interviewed numerous times in Barron\u2019s, mostly recently in late\n2022.\n\nRosenberg began his investment career as an airline analyst in the early\n1960s. He joined Loews as chief investment officer and transitioned late in\nhis career to chief investment strategist. He was an advisor to the Tisch\nfamily, including current Loews CEO James Tisch, and his father, Laurence\nTisch, who hired Rosenberg.\n\nHe was also a director for more than 20 years of CNA Financial , the property\nand casualty insurer controlled by Loews.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\n\u201cJoe was the consummate investor, proficient in investing in commodities,\nfixed income, currencies, or stocks. He was constantly fixated on finding the\nbest value, wherever it may be. One day it was copper, another day drug stocks\n\u2013 then tech stocks, and then oil. In the late \u201970s and early \u201980s it was\n30-year government bonds,\u201d James Tisch wrote in an email to Barron\u2019s.\n\n\u201cJoe was a global thinker. He had a nose for value, and much more often than\nnot his nose led to great investments.\u201d\n\nRosenberg retired from Loews at the end of 2018 and continued to invest\nactively, following the markets closely from his home in Maplewood, N.J., with\nthe help of a Bloomberg terminal. He also penned periodic missives to friends\nin the investment business, sharing his wide-ranging views about markets.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nRosenberg could be prickly and intimidating, but once someone gained his\nconfidence, he was generous with his time and insights.\n\nWhen Jim Tisch hosted a party for Rosenberg in 2012 at the \u201921\u2019 Club in\nManhattan to mark Rosenberg\u2019s 50th anniversary on Wall Street, the room was\npacked with investment luminaries, including Leon Cooperman, David Tepper, Dan\nOch, Robert Rubin, and Stan Druckenmiller. Even Michael Bloomberg, who was\nmayor at the time, made an appearance.\n\nRosenberg made some well-timed calls on the markets and individual stocks. In\nlate 2011, he compared Microsoft favorably to IBM, which had then drawn a big\ninvestment from Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cWarren Buffett came pretty late to the\nIBM party,\u201d he said.\n\nIBM has badly underperformed the S&P 500 since then. Berkshire has exited its\nIBM holding while Microsoft\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nis up more than tenfold.\n\nRosenberg made a prescient bullish call on stocks in late 2011, when the\nmarket had been depressed by worries over sovereign debt in Europe and the S&P\n500 traded around 1200, compared with more than 5000 today. \u201cI feel like a kid\nin a candy store,\u201d he told Barron\u2019s. \u201cThe best companies in the world are now\nsome of the cheapest stocks.\u201d\n\nIn his final interview with Barron\u2019s around Thanksgiving 2022, Rosenberg was\nbullish on Alphabet and Pfizer . The Alphabet call was a good one as the stock\nwas trading below $100. It is now around $165. \u201cI look at companies whose\nstocks are down a lot this year, and none has as wide a moat as Alphabet,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nPfizer, however, has since fallen nearly 50%; Rosenberg was too optimistic\nabout the company\u2019s Covid-19 franchise. He was critical of CEO Albert Bourla,\nwho he felt was spending too much on acquisitions to bolster the drug maker\u2019s\npipeline.\n\nRosenberg was bearish on U.S. Treasuries for much of the past decade when\nyields were 2% or lower. He felt the Federal Reserve was making a mistake in\nkeeping short rates close to zero.\n\nRosenberg wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal in 2016, when Sen. Bernie\nSanders had gained traction against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary\nrace with anti Wall Street rhetoric. As usual, Rosenberg got right to the\npoint, writing \u201dIt takes an immigrant like me to parse the poison that Bernie\nSanders is peddling to the naive youth of this country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nRosenberg noted that as an \u201cidealistic\u2019\u2019 18-year-old in the early 1950s, he\nworked on a kibbutz in Israel and saw firsthand the pitfalls of collectivism\nand socialism.\n\nAfter returning to the U.S. and serving for two years in the U.S. Army,\nRosenberg said, he realized that \u201cmy future lay in the capitalist U.S., not in\nIsrael.\u201d He went to night school in the late 1950s to get a finance degree and\nan MBA and then began his career on Wall Street.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders and I are poster children for what poor Jews from Brooklyn or\nGermany can accomplish in this great land of opportunity,\u201d he concluded his\nJournal article. \u201cSo I ask him: Please stop tearing down the country that has\nbeen so good to both of us.\u201d\n\nWrite to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com\n\nAd\n\n#### Most Popular Today\n\nSee more\n\nAd\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\nCookie Notice\n\nLimit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n\nCopyright Policy\n\nData Policy\n\nYour Ad Choices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
