As we\nmove toward a future defined by on-device generative AI processing, we must be\nable to evaluate the performance, accuracy and efficiency with which compute\nplatforms can run AI models. Today, one of the leading ways of measuring a\nprocessor\u2019s AI performance is trillions of operations per second (TOPS). TOPS\nis a measurement of the potential peak AI inferencing performance based on the\narchitecture and frequency required of the processor, such as the Neural\nProcessing Unit (NPU). We will dive into that below.\n\n#### What is the NPU?\n\nBefore diving into the specifics of TOPS, let's examine the NPU\u2019s importance.\nFor on-device AI processing, the NPU plays a pivotal role in driving\nefficiency and enabling innovative application experiences for individual\nusers and companies. Assessing the performance of these specialized processors\nrequires a comprehensive understanding of the metrics that underpin their\ncapabilities.\n\nThe evolution of the NPU has transformed how we approach computing.\nTraditionally, the CPU was responsible for executing AI algorithms. As the\ndemands for processing performance skyrocketed, dedicated NPUs emerged as a\nspecialized solution for handling software and applications leveraging AI.\nThese processors are designed to efficiently handle the complex mathematical\ncomputations required for AI tasks, offering unparalleled efficiency,\nperformance and power savings.\n\n#### What does AI TOPS mean?\n\nAt the heart of NPU performance measurement lies TOPS, a metric that\nillustrates the sheer computational power of these units.\n\nTOPS quantifies an NPU's processing capabilities by measuring the number of\noperations (additions, multiplies, etc.) in trillions executed within a\nsecond.\n\nThis standardized measurement strongly indicates an NPU's performance, serving\nas a crucial yardstick for comparing AI performance across different\nprocessors and architectures. Because TOPS serves as a cornerstone performance\nmetric for NPUs, exploring the parameters that make up the TOPS equation and\nhow they can dictate performance is essential. Doing so can offer a deeper\nunderstanding of an NPU's capabilities.\n\nA multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation executes the mathematical formulas at\nthe core of AI workloads. A matrix multiply consists of a series of two\nfundamental operations: multiplication and addition to an accumulator. A MAC\nunit can, for example, run one of each per clock cycle, meaning it executes\ntwo operations per clock cycle. A given NPU has a set number of MAC units that\ncan operate at varying levels of precision, depending on the NPU's\narchitecture.\n\nFrequency dictates the clock speed (or cycles per second) at which an NPU and\nits MAC units (as well as a CPU or GPU) operate, directly influencing overall\nperformance. A higher frequency allows for more operations per unit of time,\nresulting in faster processing speeds. However, increasing frequency also\nleads to higher power consumption and heat generation, which impacts battery\nlife and user experience. The TOPS number quoted for processors is generally\nat the peak operating frequency.\n\nPrecision refers to the granularity of calculations, with higher precision\ntypically correlating with increased model accuracy at the expense of\ncomputational intensity. The most common high-precision AI models are 32-bit\nand 16-bit floating point, whereas faster, low-precision, low-power models\ntypically use 8-bit and 4-bit integer precision. The current industry standard\nfor measuring AI inference in TOPS is at INT8 precision.\n\nTo calculate TOPS, start with OPS, which equals two times the number of MAC\nunits multiplied by their operating frequency. TOPS is the number of OPS\ndivided by one trillion, making it simpler to list and compare, that is,\n\nTOPS = 2 \u00d7 MAC unit count \u00d7 Frequency / 1 trillion.\n\n#### TOPS and real-world performance\n\nWhile TOPS provides valuable insights into NPU capabilities, we must still\nbridge the gap between theoretical metrics and real-world applications.\n\nAfter all, a high TOPS number alone does not guarantee optimal AI performance;\nit\u2019s the culmination of various factors working in tandem that genuinely\ndefine an NPU\u2019s prowess.\n\nThis means considering aspects such as memory bandwidth, software optimization\nand system integration when evaluating NPU performance. Benchmarks can help us\nlook beyond the numbers and understand how NPUs perform in real-world\nscenarios, where latency, throughput and energy efficiency matter more than\never.\n\nThe Procyon AI benchmark uses real workloads to help translate the theoretical\nTOPS measurement to the responsiveness and processing capabilities a user can\nexpect in real applications that use AI inferencing. It runs six models at\nmultiple precisions, giving detailed insights into how various NPUs perform.\nSimilar models to these are increasingly common in productivity, media,\ncreator and other applications. Faster performance in Procyon AI and other\nbenchmarks correlates to faster inferencing and better user experiences.\n\nTo this end, analyzing real-world performance provides valuable insights into\nan NPU's capabilities and limitations. Performance metrics must be scrutinized\nthrough the lens of practicality and pragmatism.\n\n#### The future of NPU performance metrics\n\nAs technology continues to advance at a rapid pace \u2014 and as the demands of\ndigital transformation continue to shape diverse industries \u2014 the landscape of\nNPU performance metrics is poised for further evolution. While emerging trends\nare reshaping the way we conceptualize and evaluate NPU performance and\ncomputing more broadly, TOPS is a great indicator of performance, and there's\nno reason to think it's going away any time soon.\n\nAs various new AI technologies gain traction in the coming years and redefine\ncountless industries, the need for robust performance metrics that capture\ntheir unique characteristics will become increasingly pronounced.\nAdaptability, scalability and relevance to real-world applications will define\nthe future of NPU performance metrics.\n\n#### Evaluating NPU performance for your needs\n\nNavigating the rapidly changing world of NPU performance measurements may seem\ndaunting at first, but understanding the intricacies of TOPS is vital for\nindustries and individuals alike as digital transformation \u2014 especially in the\nAI space \u2014 continues at this pace.\n\nUltimately, selecting the right system on a chip (SoC) depends on you, your\ncustomer or your organization's workload and priorities \u2014 and your decision\nmight very well depend on the SoC's NPU.\n\nWhether you prioritize raw computational power, energy efficiency or model\naccuracy, Snapdragon X Series Platforms are equipped with the world\u2019s fastest\nNPU for laptops at up to 45 TOPS to supercharge your PC and deliver real-world\nAI experiences into your workflow.\n\nExplore more topics, insights and trends in on-device generative AI within our\nAI on the Edge series\n\nRead more AI on the Edge posts\n\nLearn more about Snapdragon AI for compute\n\nAIPC\n\nOpinions expressed in the content posted here are the personal opinions of the\noriginal authors, and do not necessarily reflect those of Qualcomm\nIncorporated or its subsidiaries (\"Qualcomm\").
