So without further ado we\u2019re proud to announce\nRISC OS 5.30 is now available for the seven platforms that met or exceeded\nbenchmark.\n\n### It\u2019s a bumper edition\n\nThe gestation time has allowed a bumper crop of 347 improvements to the\n\u2018HardDisc4\u2019 image and applications, and for the main operating system \u2018ROM\u2019\nimage around 329 improvements, the exact figure depends on which hardware you\nhave.\n\nContributions came from far and wide, not least:\n\n  * Improvements from 6 currently active (or running during the period) bounties\n  * The army of 27 developers contributing to the Open Source held in GitLab\n  * Over 100 hours spent by ROOL coordinating the release activities\n  * Bernard, Stuart, Chris, John, David, Sprow, and Tank for picking over the User Guide for typos\n  * And not least the RISC OS community for testing (and sometimes breaking!) the intermediate nightly builds\n\nFor the first time, the OMAP5, most commonly used with the IGEPv5 hardware\ndesign, has switched to a stable release after resolving a previously blocking\nissue with its video driver. Nicely done!\n\n### Some serious bug squashing\n\nEach new release of RISC OS 5 keeps building on the previous solid\nfoundations. Along the way the following 76 tickets were resolved 630, 627,\n626, 625, 621, 616, 615, 613, 611, 606, 604, 603, 601, 594, 593, 590, 585,\n584, 583, 582, 581, 580, 577, 576, 574, 573, 572, 570, 568, 567, 566, 564,\n563, 560, 559, 558, 556, 555, 554, 552, 551, 550, 549, 546, 545, 543, 541,\n540, 539, 535, 533, 532, 531, 530, 525, 524, 519, 516, 515, 514, 513, 512,\n510, 509, 508, 507, 505, 498, 497, 493, 480, 468, 459, 448, 378, 295, the\noldest of which dated back to 2011.\n\n### RISC OS Pi also refreshed\n\nFor many new users the low cost Raspberry Pi computer is their first inroad\ninto using RISC OS. The ready made SD card image has been refreshed to\ninclude:\n\n  * Ovation Pro desktop publishing application courtesy of David Pilling\n  * Out of the box WiFi support for those models which have the chip on board (3B, 3A+, 3B+, 4B, 400, Compute Module 4, Zero W and Zero 2W)\n  * The full read/write edition of SparkFS, now integrated into the standard distribution across all platforms\n  * Updates across the entire collection of applications which were previously bundled on RISC OS Pi\n  * The latest version 3.11 of the Open Source web browser NetSurf\n  * Toolbox example source code for developers to dig into\n  * Improved welcome instructions for those not familiar with RISC OS\u2019 way of doing things\n\n### Getting installed\n\nWe recommend installing the HardDisc4 elements first, including updating the\n!Boot application. Once you\u2019re happy that has gone smoothly it\u2019s time to\nswitch over the main operating system too.\n\nIf starting fresh, we also offer pre-imaged micro SD cards for Pi,\nBeagleboard, and Pandaboard, plus physical ROMs for the Risc PC/A7000/A7000+.\n\n### Want to read more?\n\nA new edition of the User Guide has now been published to coincide with the\nrelease of RISC OS 5.30. Order your printed copy today spanning some 57\nchapters on everything from formatting an NVMe drive to using the tinted brush\ntool in Paint.\n\nPosted in Web site, New product, Community | 7 comments\n\n#### Comments\n\nComment on this article\n\n  1. nukeedit\n\nJulie Stamp (8365) said about 2 hours later:\n\nAmazing and fantastic news! Well done everybody :-D\n\n  2. nukeedit\n\nRichard Walker (2090) said about 5 hours later:\n\nCongratulations and thanks to all those involved.\n\nA nice touch to refresh RISC OS Pi, and very interesting that it includes WiFi\nsupport. I didn\u2019t see that sneak into the daily builds!\n\n  3. nukeedit\n\nPaolo Fabio Zaino (28) said about 6 hours later:\n\nGreat news! Congrats :)\n\nQuick note: the link above to the HardDisc4 elements returns a 404 at the\nmoment, JFYI.\n\n  4. nukeedit\n\nChris Mahoney (1684) said about 11 hours later:\n\nI think this article may have jumped the gun a bit. It\u2019s not just HardDisc4:\nas far as I can tell, none of the downloads are actually available.\n\n  5. nukeedit\n\nSprow (202) said about 12 hours later:\n\nRaspberry Pi imager has the full SD card image if you can\u2019t wait for the\nindivdual downloads to appear on this site.\n\n  6. nukeedit\n\nChris Mahoney (1684) said about 12 hours later:\n\nIt looks like things are being updated as we speak: HD4 is now available and\nthe 5.28 Pi ROM has been removed.\n\n  7. nukeedit\n\nSteve Pampling (1551) said about 21 hours later:\n\nStill in progress perhaps?\n\nThe IOMD download page only has the 5.31 beta.
