Five years went\nby before a determined reporter would unravel the mystery of her\ndisappearance.\n\nby Lona Manning\n\n> \"There is no God. There's no heaven. There's no hell. There are no angels.\n> When you die, you go in the ground, the worms eat you.\"\n>\n> \\-- Madalyn Murray O'Hair\n\nWhen David Travis arrived for work on Aug. 28, 1995 at the headquarters of\nAmerican Atheists in Austin, Tex., he knew something was wrong: The door was\nlocked and a note was posted on it: \"The Murray-O'Hair family has been called\nout of town on an emergency basis. We do not know how long we will be gone at\nthe time of the writing of this memo.\"\n\nAs Travis, a 50-ish former Army sergeant, stood there reading the note, he\nfelt the anger welling up. He couldn't say he was surprised that his employers\nwere gone, and by the looks of things, so was his job as a proofreader. He'd\nbeen suspicious that the Murray-O'Hairs were up to something ever since he had\nopened a letter from New Zealand last spring and discovered a bank statement\nfor an account he had never heard of, for almost a million dollars. And this\nwas when Madalyn Murray O'Hair, his cantankerous boss, was always crying the\nblues about money and warning him that she might not be able to meet payroll.\n\nO'Hair was always extremely secretive about the financial affairs of American\nAtheists, which she had founded in 1963 and dominated ever since. All\nfinancial records were kept locked up in a little room away from prying eyes.\nRecently, a seven- foot chain linked fence, topped with cyclone wire, had been\nbuilt around the property, a fitting emblem of O'Hair's siege mentality.\nAccording to her, the world was a hostile place, particularly toward atheists.\nShe and her family had been persecuted for 35 years for their courageous stand\nfor the separation of church and state. But lately, as her health declined,\nand with it her energy and combative spirit, O'Hair had been known to talk\nabout getting away from it all.\n\nAs August turned into September, there was still no sign of the Murray\nO'Hairs: the grandmother and matriarch of the clan, Madalyn Murray O'Hair, her\nson Jon Garth Murray, 40, and her granddaughter Robin, 30. (Robin was the\ndaughter of another son, Bill Murray, who hadn't spoken with his mother,\nbrother or his daughter in years.) The American Atheist organization was\nheaded by a five-person board of directors, but the day-to-day operations had\nbeen entirely in the hands of the O'Hair trio of mother, son and\ngranddaughter, who were lifetime members of the board and who alternated the\nroles of president, secretary and treasurer. When board members Spike Tyson, a\nVietnam veteran, and Ellen Johnson, a Vermont housewife and O'Hair loyalist,\nvisited the offices and the O'Hairs' home, the mystery deepened.\n\nAt the house the Murray-O'Hairs all shared, there were no signs of violence,\nno burglary, no forced entry -- yet it was clear that they had left abruptly.\nBreakfast dishes were sitting on the table. Madalyn O'Hair's diabetes\nmedication was on the kitchen counter. And most telling of all, their three\nlittle ankle-biting dogs, to which they were devoted, had been left behind\nwith no one to care for them.\n\nThe Murray-O'Hairs' lives revolved around the atheist movement and each other.\nThey lived together, ate together, vacationed together, and worked together.\nNow they had disappeared together.\n\nAmerica's Most Hated Woman\n\nOf all the media descriptions of Madalyn O'Hair written when news of her\ndisappearance came to light, she would have been most angered by the\nsuggestion that she had slid into \"obscurity\" since her heyday in the early\n'60s. The reports noted that O'Hair was brash, profane and vulgar, that she\nhad a reputation for being abrasive and turning friends and allies into\nenemies, that she was notoriously tight-fisted and always looking for ways to\nenrich her empire -- all of those things she might have agreed with. But the\nidea that she had been passed over, forgotten, returned to anonymity after her\nbrush with fame and destiny -- that would have rankled. She was \"America's\nmost hated woman,\" as she liked to remind herself and others, and she\npreferred being hated to being a forgotten has-been.\n\nShe became America's most hated woman in 1963, when her lawsuit protesting\nschool prayer reached the U. S. Supreme Court. Photographs show Madalyn\nstanding on the steps of the high court with her two sons, Jon Garth, then 9,\nand Bill, 16. She is smiling, hovering lovingly over her boys, and respectably\nattired with a demure hat and gloves. But the conventional-looking matron was\n-- unthinkably for the early '60s -- a divorcee and an avowed Communist with\ntwo illegitimate sons, sired by two different fathers.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision banning prayer in school enabled Madalyn to throw\noff the bondage of poverty and anonymity and gave her life a direction and a\npurpose. First though, she had to settle that bit of legal trouble with the\nBaltimore police -- she was accused of assaulting five officers when they came\nto her home to retrieve a runway teenager. (The teen was a girlfriend of\nMadalyn's oldest son, Bill). Madalyn and her family escaped to Hawaii, then\nMexico. After successfully resisting an extradition order to Maryland, she\nsettled in Texas, where she preached the gospel of the separation of church\nand state.\n\nAlong the way, she created her own persona -- the atheist crusader who\nsuffered persecution at the hands of Christians and the government. She blamed\nher father's fatal heart attack on the constant vandalism, the threatening\nphone calls, and the abusive mail the family received. But her fame brought\nher a platform and an unexpected source of income. Her admirers and supporters\nstarted sending her checks and she became a provocative talk-show guest, her\nradical utterances causing Johnny Carson's jaw to drop.\n\nAtheists, she explained, believed in the rational powers of mankind, not in\nsome superstitious mumbo-jumbo that taught people to be content with the\nstatus quo. An atheist, O'Hair said, \"accepts that a hospital should be built\ninstead of a church. An atheist accepts that a deed must be done instead of a\nprayer said.\" She knew the Bible better than many Christians and enjoyed\npointing out the cruelty and caprices of the Old Testament Jehovah, as well as\nthe sideshow carnival nature of Jesus' supposed miracles. Why did the\nChristian God, she asked, merit anyone's respect or reverence?\n\nBut Madalyn, always combative, didn't stop there. She delighted in insulting\nChristians and Christianity and preaching free love and open sexuality for\nall. She described nuns, for example, as \"poor old dried-up women lying there\non their solitary pallets yearning for Christ to come to them in a vision some\nnight and take their maidenheads. By the time they realize he's not coming,\nit's no longer a maidenhead; it's a poor, sorry tent that nobody would be able\nto pierce -- even Jesus with his wooden staff. It's such a waste.\" Her\nunabashed vulgarity was too much for some of her fellow atheists, who\npreferred a more diplomatic approach. But not Madalyn. \"I love a good fight,\"\nshe said. \"I guess fighting God and God's spokesmen is sort of the ultimate,\nisn't it?\"\n\nBut in 1980, on Mother's Day, there came a horrible blow -- her oldest boy\nBill \"came out\" as a Christian. And not a nominal, go-to-church-at-Easter\nChristian, either, but a foursquare, evangelical, come-to-Jesus, pass-the-\nplate, full-gospel Baptist. As a child, he wanted what all children want, his\nmother's love and approval. As an adult, battling an alcohol and drug problem,\nhe realized that Madalyn was unfortunately one of those people who couldn't\neven conceive of her children as separate human beings in their own right. Her\nchildren were merely extensions of her ego, and her regard for him, or for\nanyone, depended on how completely they obeyed her every command.\n\nFor years, Madalyn had referred to Bill as the reason she picked up the\ncudgels to banish prayer from the schoolroom. She wrote heart-rending articles\nabout how the other kids beat Bill up at school and ostracized him because of\nhis beliefs. But looking back, Bill Murray felt that when he stood there on\nthe Supreme Court steps, he was just being used as a prop in his mother's\nbattles against everything she hated in bourgeois America. It took all of his\npent-up anger to wrench himself free of her orbit and having done so, all\ncommunication between them ceased. His prediction that his mother would sever\nall ties with him was abundantly fulfilled -- O'Hair cast him into the void\nwith this cutting remark: \"One could call this a postnatal abortion on the\npart of a mother, I guess; I repudiate him entirely and completely for now and\nall times...He is beyond human forgiveness.\" This denouncement demonstrated\nhow she almost viewed herself as the god of her own universe; it was her\nprerogative to grant her children absolution, or even life itself.\n\nTo the evangelical movement, Bill Murray's conversion must have seemed --\nliterally -- heaven-sent. Many Christians and conservatives believe that the\nbanning of school prayer marked the beginning of America's decline into\nimmorality and crime and Murray, from his vantage point at the center of the\ndrama, agreed with them. \"In the three decades since this landmark case, the\nnation has lost its moral center,\" he wrote. \"Violent crime has increased from\n16.1 to 75.8 incidents per 10,000 population. Juvenile violent crime arrest\nrates have increased from 13.7 to 40 per 10,000 population. Teen pregnancy has\nalmost tripled from 15.3 to 43.5 per 1,000 teenage girls. Almost half of these\npregnancies end in abortion. For a startling 28 percent of all live births in\nAmerica today, the mothers are unwed. The teenage suicide rate has increased\n400 percent since 1963.\"\n\n\"I was part of the family that kicked God out of America,\" Murray tells his\naudiences today at his evangelical fundraising events. \"I know the truth\nbetter than any man in America. That is why God picked me to tell it.\"\n\nIn an atheist universe, there are no gods to roll around on the floor of\nOlympus or Valhalla, laughing at irony. Madalyn Murray O'Hair carried on\nwithout her son Bill and relied on her younger son Jon Garth Murray and her\ngranddaughter Robin to carry the atheist torch. Unfortunately, Jon Garth\nMurray was not well liked by the American Atheist headquarters staff or others\nhe came into contact with. Some diplomatically recalled that he lacked social\nskills. The undiplomatic said he was a neurotic, immature, mama's boy with a\npenchant for screaming abuse at people, and that he was generally despised.\n\n\"I almost quit my first week there when I heard Jon screaming at his mother\nwith a bunch of profanity,\" employee Travis recalled. \"I just wasn't brought\nup to talk to my mother that way, but I later came to realize he talked that\nway because that's the way she taught him to talk.\"\n\nRobin, too, lived in her powerful grandmother's shadow. She had been given up\nby Bill Murray (her mother was never mentioned) when he was a drug addict, and\nO'Hair had legally adopted her. Observers say that although Robin was more\npleasant in general than her Uncle Jon, she was seldom happy and that she,\ntoo, tended to belittle the staff, just like O'Hair. This is one reason, her\nestranged son Bill Murray suggested, that Madalyn O'Hair sometimes hired ex-\ncons to do the office work; they were anxious to find work anywhere and\ntherefore were more liable to put up with the sarcasm, the verbal abuse, and\nthe low pay.\n\nA Fateful Hire\n\nOr maybe O'Hair, a rebel herself, was drawn to those who lived outside the\nlaw. Whatever the reason, she hired ex-con David Waters in 1993, and at first\nit looked like a good choice for both of them.\n\nWaters, in his 40s, was a slick-looking man with the piercing eyes of a fox.\nO'Hair knew he had a criminal record but she later claimed she didn't know\njust how bad it was. At first the O'Hairs only knew that their new office\nmanager was obviously intelligent and well spoken and capable of more than\nworking as a $7 dollar-an-hour typesetter. By the spring of 1995 he served as\ntheir office manager. During his tenure, an expensive computer went missing.\nLater, some valuable bonds were stolen from the office safe. The O'Hairs\nsuspected that the thefts were an inside job, but still, they entrusted Waters\nwith the bank accounts and the keys while they went to California for a long-\nrunning legal dispute with another atheist organization.\n\nWhen they returned, they discovered their office manager had laid off all the\nstaff, closed the office, and emptied their bank accounts -- over $50,000\ndollars. Furious, the O'Hairs pressed charges, and waited impatiently for the\ncase to come to trial. Meanwhile, as O'Hair explained in her newsletter:\n\n> > On May 2, Mr. Waters executed an affidavit which was delivered to law\n> enforcement officials. The Murray-O'Hairs were not advised about this\n> affidavit for months \u2014 until August 23, 1994. Meanwhile, it had been\n> accepted at face value by all concerned. This was, actually, an incredible\n> document. It stated that Jon Murray had called Mr. Waters from San Diego,\n> advised that the trial was very adverse to American Atheists, and instructed\n> Mr. Waters to steal up to $100,000 by cashing the organizations' checks,\n> retain $15,000 for his \"services,\" and put $40,000 in cash in the office\n> safe for Mr. Murray. The absurdity of the affidavit should have been\n> immediately apparent to all; after all, the San Diego hearing had been\n> decided favorably for American Atheists and the Murray-O'Hairs. It did,\n> however, bring out the true nature of the police and judicial system of the\n> city of Austin, the county of Travis, and the state of Texas. An accusation\n> had been made against a nationally known Atheist (Jon Garth Murray) and,\n> simply because he was an Atheist, the accusation was seen to be plausible\n> immediately, by everyone. The defense plan...was obvious: use the hatreds\n> inherent in a Christian political system to smear the Atheist victim of a\n> crime \u2014 and go free...If Mr. Waters had stolen this amount of money from any\n> church, or had invaded the home of any minister, he would have been arrested\n> within hours, tried and convicted within days, and would even now be serving\n> a term in the Texas state penitentiary.\n\nAnd, considering Waters's extensive and serious criminal record, there seemed\nto be no urgency on the part of the prosecutors to bring him to trial. As\nMadalyn O'Hair recounted:\n\n>   * On July 21 (1994), the case was set for hearing in the 147th District\n> Court of Travis County:\n>   * called, then postponed to August 22,\n>   * called, then reset for September 9,\n>   * called, then reset to September 15,\n>   * called, then reset to October 3,\n>   * called, then reset to October 17,\n>   * called, then reset to November 7,\n>   * called, then reset to December 5,\n>   * called, then reset to January 23, 1995,\n>   * called, then reset to February 6,\n>   * called, then reset to March 13,\n>   * called, then reset to April 10,\n>   * called, then reset to April 24,\n>   * called, then reset to May 18,\n>   * called, then reset to May 22.\n>\n\n>\n> On two of these occasions, Mr. Waters's attorney did not even bother to come\n> in to court, but the trial was set over each time anyway.\n\nUnhappy with the lenient sentence Waters ultimately received -- probation and\nan order to pay back the money -- Madalyn O'Hair decided to expose him by\nwriting a lengthy article in her atheist newsletter (quoted in part above).\nShe indulged her anger with a lengthy diatribe, laying out Waters's criminal\nrecord and revealing him to be a cold-blooded animal. She reported that while\nhe was still a teenager that he had killed another boy by beating him with a\npost and leaving him in a ditch. Once out of jail, he turned on his own\nmother, beating her, screaming abuse at her, and finally urinating in her\nface. More convictions for theft, assault and fraud followed. O'Hair concluded\nthat Waters was a dangerous person and that the courts were indifferent to\nprosecuting him as he deserved to be -- because he had stolen from atheists.\n\nThe Phone Contact Stops Abruptly\n\nWhen American Atheists board members Spike Tyson and Ellen Johnson finally\nmade contact with Jon Garth Murray in San Antonio via his cell phone in early\nSeptember a few days after their disappearance, he repeated that the family\nhad been called away on urgent business, but refused to provide details. Robin\nthen got on the phone; she was worried about the family dogs but reassured\nJohnson that all was well. Johnson could tell that on the contrary, something\nwas horribly wrong. During the next few weeks, more phone calls passed between\nthe O'Hairs and various members of the organization. Finally, during her last\nphone call, Robin was so distraught she could barely speak to Johnson. Her\nlast words were, \"I know you will do the right thing.\"\n\nThen, on Sept. 28, they stopped answering the phone.\n\nNo one phoned the police and in fact, the American Atheists sought to dispel\nthe rumors, already in circulation, that O'Hair was dead.\n\n\"I can tell you categorically that Madalyn is alive,\" an American Atheist\nspokesman was quoted as saying the same day the cell phone went unanswered. I\ncan't tell you exactly what is happening. She's safe, and that's all I can\ntell you.\"\n\nThe months went by. Ellen Johnson and the remaining American Atheists picked\nup the pieces of the organization. They started to fill the backlogged book\norders, revive the members' newsletter, expand the cable-access television\nshow, plan for a national convention, and continued to deny that anything was\nwrong. Johnson, who had assumed the president's position at AA, told reporters\nthat no organization funds were missing. \"We just don't suspect foul play,\"\nshe added. \"And I cannot tell you all the reasons why. We just -- we just\ndon't.\"\n\nTheories of the Disappearance\n\nSeveral theories were in circulation. One was that the Murray-O'Hairs had\ntaken the money and run. This was what David Travis, the disgruntled former\nemployee, believed. He knew about the New Zealand money and suspected there\nmight be other offshore accounts. But there was more. He and another employee\nhad seen letters and notes from Jon, going back several years, in which Jon\nwrote about emigrating to New Zealand. The main reason the Murray-O'Hairs\nwanted to get away is because of a lawsuit that had gone sour and eaten up a\nlot of money and what remained of their reputations, as well. Madalyn had\nattempted a strong-arm takeover of another atheist organization called The\nTruthseekers. (Her son Bill Murray accused her of printing up phony stock\ncertificates as part of the takeover ploy.) Truthseekers fought back\nvigorously, and the Murray-O'Hairs feared that they could lose their entire\norganization in court. (Eventually, after a costly legal struggle,\nTruthseekers maintained its autonomy).\n\nAnother possibility that was seriously discussed was that Madalyn had\ndisappeared to die in peace. She had frequently expressed the fear that when\nshe died, Christians, or \"Christers,\" as she called them, would try to pray\nover her and she wanted no part of a deathbed repentance scene.\n\nAs for Jon Garth and Robin, they might have grown tired of their utter\ndependence on the imperious grande dame of the family and the suffocating\nlives they led together. Jon had complained that he was sick of the \"family\nbusiness\" and wanted to chuck it all and start over somewhere else. Robin,\nsensitive, shy and heading into spinsterhood, doubtless wanted a lot of things\nthat she would never achieve as long as she lived in the shadow of her\nformidable grandmother. (When Gannon and Shannon, the cocker spaniels\nbelonging to Jon Garth and Robin, disappeared in December 1995 from the fenced\ncompound behind the Atheist building, it added fuel to the speculation that\nJon and Robin were alive and well and in hiding -- with or without their\nmother.)\n\nAnother theory was that they had met with foul play. It had to be admitted\nthat O'Hair had made a lot of enemies in her career. Reporters covering the\ncase found many ex-supporters, ex-allies, and ex-employees. \"She went through\npeople like popcorn,\" said one. Her son Bill accused her of preying on the\nlonely, the confused, and the misfits -- as long as they had money -- with the\nsame kind of remorseless hypocrisy that some evangelical Christians are\naccused of. She was the atheist flip side of the religious con artist: \"She\nwas just evil. She stole huge amounts of money. She misused the trust of\npeople. She cheated children out of their parents' inheritance. She cheated on\nher taxes and even stole from her own organizations.\" But what to make of the\nmonth of September, during which the Murray-O'Hairs made and received numerous\nphone calls? If they were kidnapped, why wasn't there a ransom demand or\nsomething?\n\nFinally, there were whispers that perhaps the Christian and government\npersecutions that O'Hair had complained of for years had turned out to be more\nsinister than anyone imagined. \"If you think we are being paranoid,\" opined a\nCanadian atheist newsletter, \"the religious and government harassment suffered\npersonally by this founding family of American atheism is well recorded, along\nwith FBI and CIA infiltration of their organizations.\" \"Off the wall, I think\nthe Vatican did it,\" said a supporter. \"The Vatican or the CIA. Someone with\nenough clout to cover it up.\"\n\nO'Hair herself told Life magazine back in 1963 that it would only take one\ncrazy person to end her life: \"These death threats are no picnic...I think\nsooner or later some night some nut is going to get a message from Jesus\nChrist and I'm going to have had it. But as long as I'm still round I'm going\nto keep on being a squeaking wheel.\"\n\nWhen the Murray-O'Hairs disappeared, they left several projects hanging. They\nhad planned to picket the Pope when he visited New York City. They had just\nordered a new printing press. Was this proof that they had been abducted, or\nwas it all part of an elaborate scheme to distract their board and employees\nwhile they disappeared? Were they just pretending to carry on with business as\nusual while spiriting money out of the country and quietly packing away their\nchief asset, a large library of atheist literature? As a bewildered Ellen\nJohnson put it: \"the Murray-O'Hairs left behind the entire contents of the\noffice building, one car, all their personal belongings, their pets, their own\nbank accounts (which they have not touched) and the remainder of the office\nbank accounts and trust fund moneys. This is hard to reconcile with the idea\nthat they were robbing the till so they could escape to Shangri-La.\"\n\nIn addition to the rumors, there were also sightings: O'Hair or her children\nwere said to have been seen in Texas, in Mexico, in New Zealand, and\nelsewhere. Their presence could be felt haunting the empty halls of American\nAtheists headquarters, and in cyberspace as well. One of the most persistent\nurban legends is the story that Madalyn Murray O'Hair is petitioning the FCC\nto ban all religious programming. This warning is passed along by e-mail and\nthrough church bulletins and no matter how many times the American Atheists\nand the FCC deny the truth of the rumor, it won't die. The FCC reportedly has\nreceived millions of letters of protest and continues to receive them.\n(www.truthorfiction.com)\n\nIndifference to the Disappearance as the Months Pass\n\nNot every atheist was horror-stricken at the O'Hairs' disappearance. Frankly,\nsome -- those who disapproved of Madalyn O'Hair's combative and vulgar style\n-- were relieved that she was no longer atheism's most visible and vocal\nspokesperson. A Texan atheist wrote:\n\n> > The disappearance of the O'Hairs in September 1995 gave hope that more\n> positive atheist initiatives might develop...That's why atheists should\n> worry about the revival of Madalyn's American Atheists, Inc. under the\n> leadership of Ellen Johnson, who assumed the office of President in a\n> questionable Board of Directors meeting. Ellen Johnson is also a die-hard\n> Madalyn fan who continues to present Madalyn as an atheist heroine. What\n> atheism doesn't need is a continuation of Madalyn's negativity.\n\nBy the time Bill Murray learned that his mother, estranged daughter and half-\nbrother had vanished, board member Tyson was living in the O'Hairs' home.\nInstead of sharing their concerns and assisting each other in the search,\nMadalyn's son and the American Atheists traded insults in the media. Each\naccused the other of caring nothing for the O'Hairs, and seeking only to make\nhay out of the disappearance for the publicity it would bring. \"One of my\nmother's employees moved into her house...and began to sleep in her bed. Her\nclose \"confidant,\" Ellen Johnson, immediately flew to Texas from New Jersey\nand set up a new board of directors to take over the property and bank\naccounts of the family's atheist organizations. Not a single \"friend\" reported\nany of the three missing to the police,\" said Murray.\n\nBill Murray predicted, correctly, that when he filed a missing-persons report\non his own family, that he would be accused of \"fortune-hunting or ghoulish\nopportunism.\" That's just what happened when, a full year after the\ndisappearance and because of the mounting public clamor, Murray filed a report\nwith the Austin police. \"He has said over and over and over again that he\nwants nothing to do with them. Why is he doing it now? Publicity. He needs\nmoney for his organization,\" Tyson said of Murray. \"He hated his mother with a\npassion.\" And the filing accomplished little, anyway. The Austin police said\nthere was no evidence of foul play, and \"it is not against the law in Texas to\nbe missing.\"\n\nAs the Atheists delved into the secrets of Madalyn's empire, it was not to\ntheir advantage to publicize what they learned. O'Hair had always claimed that\nher American Atheists organization had over 50,000 members or more. There were\nin fact fewer than 2,400 addresses on the mailing list. The Murray-O'Hairs\nwere in trouble with the IRS for non-payment of income taxes, and there were\nalso questions about whether the Murray-O'Hairs had treated the organization's\nmoney as their own. Questions about financial credibility were bad news for\nthe organization, and the remaining directors tried to put the best face on\nthings. Johnson, an attractive blonde, was a considerable contrast to the\nlumpen-looking Murray-O'Hairs. Spike Tyson continued to deny that anything was\nwrong: It was \"absurd,\" he said, to suppose that the Murray-O'Hairs had stolen\nmoney. \"We know where every bank account is. Every penny is accounted for.\"\n\nA Mystery Corpse\n\n> > \"In 1986, O'Hair wrote an essay for the American Atheist about her hopes\n> that nothing special would happen to her body. She didn't want any \"dirty\n> Christers\" to get their hands on her corpse. Instead, she advised that if\n> the atheists lived nearer the coast, it would be better if Jon and Robin\n> \"could fling the carcass into the water,\" where the fish could feed on it. A\n> dead body, O'Hair wrote, was nothing more than \"a fallen leaf from a tree, a\n> dog killed on the highway, a fish caught in a net.\"\n>>\n\n>> \\-- journalist Robert Bryce\n\nThe male body found on a riverbank east of Dallas in early October of 1995,\nlying on its back, stripped naked and abandoned among the weeds and the\ngarbage, was like that -- like a leaf, a dog, a fish on the riverbank.\nDetective Robert Bjorklund wanted to find the \"cocky bastards\" who killed him,\nmutilated him and tossed him away. \"The way they laid him out was like, 'Come\nand find us.'\" Bjorklund checked over 200 missing-persons cases, but couldn't\nfind the corpse's identity. The corpse did not offer much in the way of clues.\n\nThere were no clothes. No tattoos. Very little blood. No distinctive scars. No\nhands.\n\nNo head.\n\nSo the body was photographed, sampled, and given a pauper's burial. But\nBjorklund didn't forget about the mystery corpse.\n\nA Reporter and a Private Eye Search for the Missing Murray-O'Hairs\n\nFall turned into winter, winter to spring, and summer returned again to the\nTexas plains, with no word of the Murray-O'Hairs.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, a San Antonio reporter by the name of John MacCormack\nwas assigned the Murray-O'Hair story for the one-year anniversary of the\ndisappearance. MacCormack had more than 20 years of journalism experience and\nthe face of a friendly bulldog. If a story interested him, he would lock on to\nit and not let go. He interviewed the American Atheist board members but found\nthem to be tight-lipped, even denying that anything was amiss.\n\nA few months later, a tip led McCormack to one of the few indisputable facts\nhe could work with: The American Atheists finally admitted, in its 1995 tax\nreturns, that a large sum of money was missing, and all the evidence pointed\nto Jon Garth Murray as the thief. He had arranged for the transfer and\nwithdrawal of a large amount of money -- over $600,000, last September,\nshortly before his disappearance. In addition, he had sold his Mercedes\nthrough a classified ad.\n\nThis is the kind of information that captures the interest of the IRS, who\nrevoked the American Atheists' tax exempt status pending an investigation, and\nfinally the wheels started to turn on the O'Hair case. But it was not death\nthat interested the federal agency; it was that other inevitability, taxes.\nThe Murray-O'Hairs owed a considerable tax bill. In February 1997, the IRS\nseized the Murray-O'Hairs' house and property, evicting Spike Tyson. The\nAmerican Atheists had a vested interest in whatever the Murray-O'Hairs had\nleft behind, as President Ellen Johnson told the members, so the organization\nalso was \"active...in legal proceedings to recover missing funds taken by Jon\nMurray.\"\n\nSignificantly, when the revelations about the missing money came to light, no\none who knew the O'Hairs came forward to say, \"They couldn't possibly have\ndone this. I know them. They couldn't have stolen this money.\" Instead, Arnold\nVia, who described himself as a friend of the O'Hairs said, \"If they misled\nus, abandoned us and stole money, they are crooks.\"\n\nReporter MacCormack hitched up with a private investigator named Tim Young,\nwho had decided that the search for one of America's most famous women and her\nfamily looked intriguing. Young obtained Jon Garth's cell phone records for\nthat last, mysterious month in San Antonio. Together, MacCormack and Young\nstarted checking every phone number on the phone logs. Before September 1995,\nJon Garth didn't use his cell phone much, but during that last month, over 200\nphone calls were made to financial institutions, jewelers, overseas long-\ndistance services, travel agencies -- all tending to confirm the idea that the\nO'Hairs had been planning to flee the country.\n\nMcCormack explained, \"We went door-to-door to all the places that (Jon Garth)\ncalled. We knocked on one door, and found where the $600,000 went.\"\n\nDuring that mysterious month of September 1995, Jon Garth had contacted a\njewelry store in San Antonio and asked to purchase $600,000 worth of gold\ncoins. The jeweler instructed him to wire money to the jeweler's account and\nthe order was placed on his behalf. The only time the jeweler met his customer\nwas when Jon Garth came in on Friday, September 29, to pick up his 1,500\ncoins. The jeweler, Cory Ticknor, remembered that Jon Garth was inexperienced\nat handling gold coins and seemed like he badly needed a shower, but did not\nappear nervous or distraught. He was escorted to his car by a police officer\nmoonlighting as a security guard. Then he was gone. Ticknor was the last\nperson known to have seen Jon Garth Murray alive.\n\nMacCormack's discovery only deepened the mystery and the speculation, but the\nevidence continued to point to some dishonesty on the part of Jon Garth, if\nnot all of the Murray-O'Hairs.\n\nVanity Fair Duped\n\nEx-con David Waters, the former office manager, was as willing as anyone to\nspeculate on their disappearance. In fact, he had been a principal source for\nan investigative article in Vanity Fair magazine, published in the spring of\n1997, in which reporter Mimi Swartz concluded that the Murray-O'Hairs had\nabsconded to New Zealand.\n\nSwartz found abundant evidence to show that the Murray-O'Hairs might have been\nplanning to liquidate American Atheist assets and flee the scene. Some of the\ndocuments and letters she relied on were given to her by Waters, who had\npurloined them from the American Atheists office during his tenure there. They\nproved the O'Hairs had been discussing a move to New Zealand for years. For\nexample, a 1985 letter written by Jon Garth stated: \"Should it become\nnecessary for us to flee this country, we would like to have some funds on\ndeposit outside the United States so that we would not be leaving in an\nentirely destitute condition.\" Waters also claimed that Madalyn and Jon Garth\nhad framed him for the theft of the money from American Atheists because he\nwas on to their money-laundering scheme and their preparations for their\nflight out of the country. Waters even suggested that the Murray-O'Hairs were\nbehind the mysterious, unsolved thefts of the computer and the bearer bonds.\nHe was working on a book about the whole thing.\n\nAlthough more than one reporter was tantalized by Waters's documents and his\ntheory -- he enjoyed talking to reporters -- Bill Murray grew increasingly\nskeptical as the months turned to years, that his mother, half-brother and\ndaughter were still alive. For one thing, his mother would be unable to resist\nthe publicity her disappearance had generated. The most dangerous place to be\nwas in between Madalyn O'Hair and a camera, he pointed out.\n\nMurray also stated flatly that the world, big as it was, was not big enough to\nhide the O'Hairs. \"You have these three obese people. Robin requires two\nairline seats wherever she goes. My mother uses the f-word in virtually every\nsentence that comes out of her mouth. Just singularly, they would be\nremembered. Together, it's like waving a red flag in front of a bull.\" By the\nsecond anniversary of their disappearance, Bill Murray was convinced that his\nfamily had been murdered, and murdered for money. While he did not pretend to\nbe grief-stricken at his loss, Murray did conscientiously attempt to interest\nvarious law enforcement agencies in investigating the disappearance, to little\navail, and always against the unvarying hostility of the American Atheists.\n\nThe Tip That Breaks the Case\n\nJohn MacCormack continued his interest in the case and came to be recognized\nas a leading authority on the O'Hair disappearance. In June 1998, after he'd\nbeen interviewed for a major television newsmagazine piece on the mystery, he\nwas at his desk at the San Antonio newspaper where he worked, when he got an\nanonymous phone call. The caller told MacCormack that the disappearance of a\nsmall-time con artist, Danny Fry, might be linked to the disappearance of the\nMurray-O'Hairs. The caller was close to Fry and knew that he had traveled from\nFlorida to Texas in the summer of 1995 to stay with none other than David\nWaters, then had disappeared at the end of September -- the same time as the\nMurray-O'Hairs.\n\nMacCormack was intrigued. He knew that Waters, who still lived in a ramshackle\napartment in Austin, had been promoting the theory that the Murray-O'Hairs had\nabsconded with American Atheists funds.\n\nBut the anonymous voice on the other end of the phone line was telling\nMacCormack that Waters knew precisely what had happened to the Murray-O'Hairs\n-- because Waters had kidnapped and murdered them. And the caller was afraid\nthe same fate had befallen Fry.\n\nFry's fianc\u00e9e confirmed that her man was susceptible to get-rich-quick\nschemes. \"Danny was not the type of person to make $300 or $500 a week. He\nwanted to make a lot of money, and he kept telling me there was a big, big\nbacker, a big construction thing, (in Texas).\"\n\nInitially, Fry called his fianc\u00e9e and his daughter back in Florida every day,\nbut toward the end of September, he grew terse and evasive. His fianc\u00e9e\nrecalled, \"I started wondering and asking him questions and he got real angry\nwith me. He said, 'Don't ask.'\"\n\n\"The last day he called, I said, 'Danny, please come home,' and he said, 'I've\ngot one more thing to do. Then I'll come home,' \" she said.\n\nBut he never did. Danny Fry had joined the Murray-O'Hairs to become one of the\napproximately 100,000 missing persons in the United States. Fear of David\nWaters had kept Fry's family from going public, but MacCormack's investigation\nhad given them hope that the truth might come out.\n\nMacCormack pondered the possibilities. Madalyn O'Hair fires an ex-con for\nstealing money from the American Atheists. Danny Fry, as it turned out, served\nprison time with Waters. Fry leaves his family and travels to Texas. He\ndisappears the same weekend the O'Hairs do -- right after the purchase of half\na million dollars of gold coins.\n\nThings had taken a decidedly sinister twist, but there was no hard evidence.\nAnd David Waters could look a reporter straight in the eyes and say, \"I am in\nno way connected with their disappearance, demise, relocation to a sunny clime\nor anything else that has to do with (the Murray-O'Hairs).\" He complained that\nMacCormack was his \"nemesis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Austin police were still saying that there was no indication\nthat a crime had been committed. \"I'm of the opinion that they are not dead\nand that there was no foul play involved. I still have that feeling,\" said the\nlead investigator on the case. \"If somebody wants to show me a body or a crime\nscene, I'll be glad to have my opinion changed.\"\n\nBy then, the O'Hairs had been missing for three years.\n\nWhen MacCormack obtained Fry's long-distance bills he saw that Waters had been\nlying when he claimed that he and Fry had been casual acquaintances who had\nseen each other briefly in Texas. When Fry was still in Florida in the summer\nof 1995, Waters had phoned him and they had held lengthy conversations. Fry\ntraveled to Austin and lived in Waters's apartment, but in September, at the\nsame time the Murray-O'Hairs disappeared, Fry started phoning his family from\nSan Antonio. Some calls were placed from a pay phone that overlooked the\nswimming pool at the Warren Inn in Northwest San Antonio. Finally, in the last\nfew days before his disappearance, Fry was back in Austin.\n\nMacCormack also published the fact that David Waters was in San Antonio in\nSeptember of 1995, buying a white Cadillac with $13,000 cash. This was at the\nsame time that Jon Garth and Robin's credit card records showed that they were\nmaxing out their cards with cash advances.\n\nThe Headless Corpse Gets a Name\n\n> > All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to\n> the wicked; to the good and to the clean; and to the unclean; to him that\n> sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the\n> sinner, and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.\n>>\n\n>> This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is\none event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil,\nand madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the\ndead.\n\n>>\n\n>> Ecclesiastes, 9:2-3\n\nA few months after the phone call about Danny Fry, in the fall of 1998,\nMacCormack was reading the morning wire stories on his computer when a short\nitem out of Dallas caught his attention. It was the third-year anniversary of\nthe appearance on the banks of the Trinity River of a male corpse, minus head\nand hands. Dallas police were stumped.\n\nMacCormack contacted the Dallas police department and explained there might be\na connection between their headless corpse and three missing atheists and a\npile of gold coins. The police thought the killing had all the earmarks of a\ndrug murder, but luckily, they were willing to test MacCormack's theory. Fry's\nfamily cooperated by providing DNA samples.\n\nA few months later, they had their answer.\n\n\"It is confirmed, \"said Detective Robert Bjorklund, \"that our homicide victim\nis Danny Fry. The probability is.... 99.99 percent.\"\n\nMacCormack courageously continued to write articles about the damning\ncircumstantial evidence against Waters, even as it became apparent to him that\nWaters was a cold-blooded killer and an extremely dangerous man. A third ex-\ncon entered the picture, as well: Gary Karr was another alumni of the prison\nsystem and had also served time with David Waters. Karr, in his early 50s, was\na tough-looking brute who had convictions for rape and kidnapping, and had\nonly been out of prison a few months. He was also in Texas, staying at David\nWaters's apartment, at the time of the Murray-O'Hairs' disappearance. Waters\ncontinued to meet with reporters, coolly denying any involvement in the\ndisappearance of the Murray-O'Hairs and Fry.\n\nBut, at long last, law enforcement authorities were taking notice. Three\nmonths after MacCormack published his scoop about Danny Fry's murder, federal\nagents served search warrants on Karr's home in Michigan and David Waters's\napartment in Texas. Much of their information came from Karr's ex-wife and\nWaters's ex-girlfriend, both of whom had known about mysterious happenings\nback in 1995, but had kept their mouths shut for three and a half years.\nMacCormack's revelations, however, and questioning by law enforcement, had\ndone wonders in awakening their consciences.\n\nIn short order, both Karr and Waters found themselves back in jail on\nunrelated charges. Rounds of ammunition were found in Waters's apartment, a\nviolation of his parole. Karr was locked up on firearms charges as well. Using\nthe evidence seized, including financial records and a bow saw, the FBI was\nable to piece together the story of the O'Hairs' last month on earth.\n\"Initially, I was looking at Jon Murray for money laundering and I ended up\nwith four dead people,\" said Ed Martin, lead agent for the IRS.\n\nWhat Happened to the Murray-O'Hairs\n\nThe Murray-O'Hairs had been held for a month. There is no evidence that any of\nthem tried to escape or summon help during that time, which mystifies some\nobservers. Madalyn O'Hair had been the most closely confined, at the Warren\nInn Apartments in Northeast San Antonio, and Robin was probably her companion.\nTheir principal guard was Fry, who had no serious criminal record and was\nregarded as a good-natured charmer with a gift of gab. He must have been\nrecruited by Waters for these qualities -- to keep the Murray-O'Hairs quiet\nand cooperative while Waters tried to extract all the wealth he could from\nthem. Jon Garth had the most \"freedom.\" In addition to various banking errands\naround San Antonio, he even traveled to New Jersey with Gary Karr to\nfacilitate the money transfer to buy the gold coins. Bill Murray speculates\nthat Jon Garth's acquiescence was purchased with threats to the safety of his\nmother and niece. Perhaps Jon Garth held out hope to the very end that the\nMurray-O'Hairs would be allowed to live.\n\nWater's ex-girlfriend later testified that Waters was so angry when Madalyn\nO'Hair wrote her article denouncing him in her newsletter, that he fantasized\nabout torturing her and pulling off her toes with pliers. For a cold-blooded\npsychopath like Waters, merely robbing from the O'Hairs was not revenge enough\nfor losing his job and being exposed by the article. He probably relished\ntelling Madalyn O'Hair, face to face, precisely how the O'Hairs contributed to\ntheir own disaster -- how he had letters, written by them, detailing their\nplanned move to New Zealand. As the days of captivity went by, he might have\nmocked them. Who was looking for them? Nobody. Who cared enough about them to\nlook for them? Nobody. Nobody at all in this world. Just as he brutalized his\nown mother, he probably brutalized Madalyn O'Hair. Taunting her with the fact\nthat her own secrecy about her financial affairs, her own imperious conduct,\nmeant that no one would question her disappearance. \"I know you'll do the\nright thing,\" Robin cryptically told the American Atheists board members\nbefore she disappeared. But to the American Atheists, doing the right thing\nhad always meant doing as Madalyn told them to do.\n\nMadalyn O'Hair, however, must have faced Waters with her customary courage,\nbecause Waters apparently never learned about the other New Zealand bank\naccounts in Jon Garth's name, because they were untouched, nor about a bank\naccount in San Antonio that contained $23,000. Waters got only the Mercedes,\nthe cash advances from the credit cards, and half a million dollars in gold\ncoins. In fact, there was another, second delivery of $100,000 in gold coins\nthat was not picked up from the jeweler's.\n\nThe end of September must have been a significant deadline for Waters --\nperhaps the difficulty of holding, or secretly transporting, three people in\nthe middle of a small city was proving to be too difficult and dangerous. At\nany rate, the O'Hairs met their end on or shortly after September 29, 1995.\nThey were either murdered, probably by strangulation at Waters's hands, in the\nmotel, or were transported, either dead or alive, to a storage locker rented\nby another associate of Waters, \"Chico\" Osborne. Inside the locker, Waters and\npossibly Karr and Fry carried out the grisly task of sawing the bodies into\npieces. Later, they were dumped into barrels, and transported 120 miles to a\nremote ranch. The O'Hairs were dumped into a shallow grave, where they\nremained undiscovered for over five years.\n\nFry survived the O'Hairs by one or two days at most -- then he, too, was gone,\nprobably shot in the head, and dismembered.\n\nAfter Waters cleaned out the storage locker with a spray of water and bleach,\nhe and his girlfriend checked into a hotel for several days of serious\npartying. Waters and Karr bought the best suits money could buy, ordered\nchampagne, and flashed around their newly acquired Rolex watches. Most of the\nmoney was stashed in a storage locker rented by Waters's girlfriend, but they\nmade a serious dent in the $80,000 they had on hand.\n\nIn an atheist universe, there is no revengeful god, or even a Nemesis to exact\nretribution. But a few days after killing the O'Hairs and Fry, Waters returned\nto the locker to discover that the lock was open and the money was gone. All\nof it. For his months of planning and effort, all he had left was revenge and\nthe knowledge that he had committed probably the perfect crime. Or had he? Who\nknew about those gold coins?\n\nPostscripts\n\n> > For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope; for a living\n> dog is better than a dead lion.

His only response was to roll his eyes in amazement.\"\n\nKarr was brought to trial in May 2000, where the jury heard the story of a\ncold-blooded murder. Without any bodies, though, the jury did not convict Karr\nfor murder, but his convictions for extortion and money laundering were enough\nto send the career criminal back to jail for life.\n\nDavid Waters never faced trial for the kidnapping and murder of the Murray-O\n'Hairs. In March of 2001, he was sentenced to 20 years (in addition to earlier\nsentences of 60 and 25 years). As a result of a plea bargain he revealed the\nlocation of the Murray-O'Hairs' bodies. Waters died of lung cancer in January\nof 2003 in a federal prison hospital in North Carolina.\n\nIn addition to solving the murders of the O'Hairs and Danny Fry, agents were\nfinally able to track down the missing gold coins. It turned out that a group\nof thieves from San Antonio, who had a master key to the type of lock Waters\nused, came across his storage locker. To their utter amazement, they had found\na suitcase full of gold coins, which they promptly fell to spending. Only one\ncoin was recovered by police. The theft of the coins seems so bizarre, so\nimprobable, that merely calling it \"coincidence\" or \"chance\" seems too feeble,\nbut federal agents and the thieves themselves swear that this is precisely\nwhat happened.\n\nThe missing cocker spaniels Gannon and Shannon have not been seen since they\ndisappeared from a locked compound at the American Atheist headquarters.\n\nIn January 2001, a full five and a half years after they were last seen, the\nMurray-O'Hairs were finally found on a sprawling ranch near the little town of\nCamp Wood, Tex. (The owner of the ranch was not implicated in their deaths.)\nFederal agents, led to the scene by David Waters, found skulls, scorched\ncloth, severed bones, and a metal hip belonging to Madalyn O'Hair. As Bill\nMurray told his supporters in his website: http://www.wjmurray.com/\n\n> > One federal agent at the scene told me of how gruesome the situation was.\n> The bodies had been dismembered and then burned...That same agent also told\n> me that he had offered a prayer over the bodies when they were first\n> discovered. He told me, \"No one deserves this, no one.\"\n\nThe feud between American Atheists and Bill Murray continued. Johnson, the\norganization's president, denied that Bill Murray could possibly have any\nclaim or interest in the remains of people he evidently despised, even if they\nwere his kin, his own mother, half-brother and daughter. Murray countered that\nJohnson only wanted to use the remains as a relic for fund-raising purposes.\n\nAfter the identification of the remains was confirmed, they were given to Bill\nMurray for burial, and he announced that, in accordance with his own beliefs\nand his late mother's wishes, he would not pray at the burial site.\n\n> > As an evangelical, I do not pray for the dead. Baptists believe that upon\n> death the fate of the soul is sealed. The deceased person is in Glory with\n> God, or in Hell. In either event, prayer is fruitless at that point....

The details of the last days and hours of my mother, brother and\ndaughter were so brutal that even men accustomed to violence were emotionally\nshaken.\n\nOf the many ironies involved in the O'Hair story, one is that Madalyn O'Hair\nbattled the government all her life and conscientiously avoided paying taxes.\nShe was especially suspicious of the FBI, believing Hoover's organization to\nbe the malevolent agent of the evil theocracy that was the United States. But\nit was the FBI and the IRS who finally avenged her murder. And some of those\nagents involved in the case, those who searched for her, found her, and\nattended her burial, expressed the deepest sorrow over the horrors that she\nand her family had endured at the hands of David Waters, Gary Karr and Danny\nFry.\n\n> > ''I hope I live my life in such a manner that when I die, someone cares -\n> even if it is only my dogs.
