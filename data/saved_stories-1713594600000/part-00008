As we begin 2021, we wanted to send one last note to our friends and supporters at the SecurityFocus BugTraq mailing list. As many of you know, assets of Symantec were acquired by Broadcom in late 2019, and some of those assets were then acquired by Accenture in 2020 (https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-completes-acquisition-of-broadco ms-symantec-cyber-security- services-business.htm). SecurityFocus assets were included in this transition, and the mailing list has not been updated since the work to transition to Accenture began. The SecurityFocus assets, including the BugTraq mailing list, has a long history of providing timely information on the latest vulnerabilities, security vendor announcements, and exploit information. We are forever grateful to those who created, maintained, and contributed to the archive - many of us have connected and learned from each other through these lists. The history of the list and the sharing of the information has contributed to ensuring that we are building the information security community to be something stronger. Community contribution is one of the foundations to building a stronger Information Security force. At this time, resources for the BugTraq mailing list have not been prioritized, and this will be the last message to the list. The archive will be shut down January 31st, 2021. For similar information, please refer to some of the following links: https://www.defcon.org/html/links/mailing-lists.html https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/ This is where the appropriate geek-like reference and farewell comes in, something like \u00e2So long, and thanks for all the fish\u00e2, but that seems too cavalier for this. So thank you, for your support, wisdom, and willingness to share \u00e2 whether you are a contributor, reader, or lurker on the list. All of you have made a difference. Be well, and keep up the good work!\n\nBy Date\n\nBy Thread\n\n### Current thread:\n\n  * BugTraq Shutdown alias (Jan 15)\n\n    * <Possible follow-ups>\n    * Re: BugTraq Shutdown tommypickle (Jan 16)\n\n## Nmap Security Scanner\n\n  * Ref Guide\n  * Install Guide\n  * Docs\n  * Download\n  * Nmap OEM\n\n## Npcap packet capture\n\n  * User's Guide\n  * API docs\n  * Download\n  * Npcap OEM\n\n## Security Lists\n\n  * Nmap Announce\n  * Nmap Dev\n  * Full Disclosure\n  * Open Source Security\n  * BreachExchange\n\n## Security Tools\n\n  * Vuln scanners\n  * Password audit\n  * Web scanners\n  * Wireless\n  * Exploitation\n\n## About\n\n  * About/Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Advertising\n  * Nmap Public Source License\n\n", "frontpage": false}
