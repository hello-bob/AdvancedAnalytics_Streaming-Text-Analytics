Leave it to the Hamptons to figure out a way to turn riding the bus\ninto something fancy.\n\nIn today's big story, we examine how tough the job market is for the well-paid\nemployee.\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\n  * Markets: The brutal reality of life as a first-year investment banking analyst.\n\n  * Tech: Elon Musk secures a big win for Tesla in China.\n\n  * Business: Higher-for-longer interest rates aren't going anywhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut first, the plight of the upper middle class.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\n### The big story\n\n## High pay, low vibes\n\nGetty Images; Alyssa Powell/BI\n\nMore money; more problems.\n\nThat's the current job trend, as higher-paid employees are having trouble\nfinding work despite a historically strong labor market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's creating what Business Insider's Aki Ito describes as a \"white-collar\nrecession.\" The hiring rate for workers making less than $55,000 annually\n(1.5%) is well above the rate for those making more than $96,000 (0.5%).\n\nIt's true not many people need work, so the lack of open roles isn't critical\nto the economy. But not everyone is happy at their job.\n\nThe dearth of hiring for higher-paying jobs has created a \"trapped in place\"\neconomy, a concept previously highlighted by BI's Emily Stewart.\n\nThere are worse problems than making six figures at a job you don't\nparticularly like. Especially considering the number of Americans struggling\nto afford basic necessities but making too much to get help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Aki points out, white-collar workers' issues could be a sign of bad\ntimes to come for everyone. Companies' hesitancy to hire expensive talent\nmight be about preparing for a market downturn.\n\niStock; Rebecca Zisser/BI\n\nThe so-called white-collar recession could also have a lasting impact on the\njob market for high earners.\n\nIt comes as high-paying jobs have faced some recent headwinds. Last year saw\nthe demise of middle managers.\n\nAnd the long-term impact of AI on white-collar roles remains an ongoing\nquestion. For example, a key job for aspiring Wall Streeters \u2014 investment\nbanking analyst \u2014 might face a hiring pullback thanks to the benefits of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt speaks to the broader theme of efficiency Big Tech companies have touted\nfor the better part of a year.\n\nThere's still money to be made in corporate America, to be sure. AI\nspecialists remain a sought-after asset for most businesses. Cybersecurity is\nanother good bet, as firms are investing big in the space.\n\nBut for the rest of us, the era of cushy jobs with healthy salaries and light\nresponsibilities might be ending.\n\nMaybe that's why Gen Z is going through its own divide. While some young\nworkers are quickly looking to climb the corporate ladder, others have\ncompletely disconnected from work or school.\n\n## 3 things in markets\n\nChristine Ji/Kenneth Tan, Alexander Spatari/Getty Images, Abanti Chowdhury/BI\n\n  1.
