This is the lowest annual figure in recorded history\nover the last 300 years, exacerbating an already dire population catastrophe\nfacilitated by economic turmoil and war.\n\nUkraine's demographic crisis dates back to the Soviet collapse in 1991, when\nthe country\u2019s population stood at 51.9mn. Economic crises and labour migration\nsaw the country\u2019s total fertility rate plummet to 1.4 births per woman (well\nbelow the replacement level of 2.1) by 2022 and possibly as low as .7 by the\nfollowing year, according to Ukraine\u2019s Institute of Demography and Social\nStudies.\n\nAs bne IntelliNews reported, Emerging Europe is already suffering from a\ndemographic crisis that will take population levels back to the early 20th\ncentury in the coming decade. Germany has a fertility rate of 1.6 in 2023.\nUkraine\u2019s population fell behind that of Poland for the first time as an\nelectronic census revealed the number of citizens had dropped by some 5mn\npeople to 37.289mn in 2020 since the last census in 2000. By contrast, a UN\nstudy found the populations in Central Asia are booming and are all expected\nto grow in the next few decades.\n\nThanks to the relative prosperity that Russians enjoyed following the end of\nthe recession in the middle of this decade, plus a pro-birth government\npolicies, Russian fertility rates recovered to 1.8 in 2023 \u2013 one of the\nhighest in Europe \u2013 from record lows in the middle of the decade when the\nfertility rate fell to a record low 1.5.\n\nThe size of Ukraine\u2019s population had been a matter of speculation for several\nyears. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy promised to hold a census in\n2020 as part of his election manifesto but cut some corners and held an\nelectronic census last year instead. The size of the population also shrank by\nsome 4mn after Russia annexed the Crimea in 2014.\n\nBut even ignoring these problems, the demographic curve shows that Ukraine\u2019s\npopulation has been in an uninterrupted decline since 1991, and took an even\nsharper downward step in 2014 following the 2014 Revolution of Dignity.\n\nThe introduction of visa-free travel by the EU in 2017, while hailed as a\nlandmark reform, has precipitated a mass labour outflow, further exacerbating\nUkraine's demographic woes. The exodus of millions to Central European\ncountries in search of better opportunities has further strained the country's\npopulation dynamics.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has spurred another mass exodus, with millions seeking\nrefuge in neighbouring countries. Estimates suggest that approximately 8mn\nrefugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, with Russia\nbeing the largest recipient. Tatyana Moskalkova, Russia\u2019s human rights\nombudswoman, has claimed that over 5mn Ukrainians have come to Russia \u201cseeking\nsafety from Ukrainian shelling and bombing.\u201d This staggering exodus of\ncitizens has helped Uzbekistan (with 34.9mn people last year) overtake Ukraine\nto become the second most populous country in the former Soviet Union since\nlast year.\n\nA study conducted last year by Ukraine\u2019s Institute for the Future counted only\n29mn souls in modern-day Ukraine, with many refugees abroad showing no intent\nto return home. Compounded with catastrophically low fertility levels and\nongoing conflict, these factors do not bode well for the country\u2019s demographic\nfuture.\n\n#Ukraine #demographics\n\nRead in IntelliNews Pro\n\nGet IntelliNews Pro\n\n# Related Content\n\n# Russia is producing weapons at a record pace, and Ukraine\u2019s partners are\ntrying to increase support\n\n# Lithuanian leaders back sending 29,000 military-age men back to Ukraine\n\n# Startup Defence Builder to build drones and technology requested by the army\n\nRussia is producing weapons at a record pace, and Ukraine\u2019s partners are\ntrying to increase support\n\nLithuanian leaders back sending 29,000 military-age men back to Ukraine\n\nStartup Defence Builder to build drones and technology requested by the army\n\n# Data\n\n# Polish CPI picks up growth to 2.4% y/y in April, flash estimate shows\n\n## Polish CPI grew 2.4% year on year in April (chart), just below the\nconsensus line of 2.5% y/y and 0.4pp above the March reading, a flash estimate\nfrom Poland\u2019s statistical office GUS showed on April 30.\n\n# Preliminary Q1 GDP data shows Hungarian economy posts modest rebound\n\n## GDP grew 1.1% year on year in Q1 and by 1.7% when adjusted for calendar\neffects.\n\n# Russia\u2019s Economic Ministry issues bleak economic stress test scenario\n\n## Russia's Finance Ministry ran an extreme stress test on the economy for\nthis year that assumes zero growth, a weakening ruble and falling oil and gas\nrevenues in the worst-case scenario.\n\n# Moldova\u2019s industrial output shows signs of recovery in February\n\n## More abundant and cheaper gas this year creates opportunity for resumption\nof industrial activity in Moldova.\n\n# Russia\u2019s CBR maintains key rate at 16%\n\n## The board of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) resolved to keep the key\ninterest rate unchanged at 16% at the policy meeting on April 26, making a\nthird meeting in a row that the rate is maintained flat.\n\nPolish CPI picks up growth to 2.4% y/y in April, flash estimate shows\n\n11 hours ago\n\nPreliminary Q1 GDP data shows Hungarian economy posts modest rebound\n\n20 hours ago\n\nRussia\u2019s Economic Ministry issues bleak economic stress test scenario\n\n2 days ago\n\nMoldova\u2019s industrial output shows signs of recovery in February\n\n2 days ago\n\nRussia\u2019s CBR maintains key rate at 16%\n\n4 days ago\n\n### Follow Us On\n\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Telegram Flipboard Feedly\n\n### Most Read\n\n  * Day\n  * This week\n  * This month\n\n  1.
