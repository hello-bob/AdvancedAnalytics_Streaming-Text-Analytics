But it can be useful if you really need a lot of digits\nfor some reason (e.g. a large number of digits of mathematical constants are\nsometimes incorporated into cryptographic algorithms), or as a cross-check on\nother calculating systems.\n\nFor more information, read the manual online, which includes some examples of\nthe sort of thing spigot can do.\n\nspigot is named after its core algorithm, which is Jeremy Gibbons's unbounded\nspigot algorithm for the digits of \u03c0, enhanced to support more output modes\nand a lot more input numbers.\n\n## Licence\n\nspigot is distributed under the MIT licence, so it is free to copy,\nredistribute, use and reuse.\n\nFor more details, see the file called LICENCE in the distribution archive, or\nthe licence appendix in the documentation.\n\n## Download\n\nA Unix source archive of spigot is available here:\n\n> spigot-20240202.10bd0ca.tar.gz\n\nspigot can run on Windows too. A pre-compiled Windows executable is here:\n\n> spigot.exe\n\nIf you want to see the latest state of development, you can check the\ndevelopment sources out from my git repository:\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://git.tartarus.org/simon/spigot.git\n\nAlternatively, you can browse the repository on the web, here.\n\n## Feedback\n\nPlease report bugs to anakin@pobox.com.\n\nYou might find it helpful to read this article before reporting a bug.\n\nPatches are welcome.\n\n(comments to anakin@pobox.com) (thanks to chiark for hosting this page) (last\nmodified on Fri Feb 2 02:42:56 2024)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
