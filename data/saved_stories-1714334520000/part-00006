Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage\nresources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest.\n\nInspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor\nLords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform\ngameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in\nfavor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic,\ncolorful, and believable.\n\nManor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of\nplacement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real\nmedieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape\ninfluenced how settlements formed and developed.\n\n  * Spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth.\n  * Assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly.\n  * Build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes \u2013 they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide.\n  * Guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter.\n\nFrom boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety\nof goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed\ninto finished products through production chains, and you must balance the\nbasic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to\nensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor\nto aid in your conquests.\n\n  * Resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket?\n  * Unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation.\n  * Establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples\u2019 homes, import goods you can\u2019t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers.\n\nYours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing\nambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead\nyour people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but\nas your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering.\n\n  * Train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead?\n  * Command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely \u2013 a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well.\n  * Feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city.\n\nThis game is a passion project started by a solo developer. You can reach out\nto me and share your opinions, ideas, and criticisms - I listen to your\nfeedback.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n## System Requirements\n\nMinimum:\n\n    * Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system\n    * OS: Windows\u00ae 10 (64-bit)\n    * Processor: Intel\u00ae CoreTM i5-4670 (quad-core) / AMD\u00ae FX-SeriesTM FX-4350 (quad-core)\n    * Memory: 8 GB RAM\n    * Graphics: NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GTX 1050 (2 GB) / AMD\u00ae RadeonTM RX-460 (4 GB) / Intel\u00ae ArcTM A380 (6 GB)\n    * DirectX: Version 12\n    * Storage: 15 GB available space\n\nRecommended:\n\n    * Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system\n    * OS: Windows\u00ae 10 (64-bit)\n    * Processor: Intel\u00ae CoreTM i5-7600 (quad-core) / AMD\u00ae RyzenTM 3 2200G (quad-core)\n    * Memory: 12 GB RAM\n    * Graphics: NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GTX 1060 (6 GB) / AMD\u00ae RadeonTM RX 580 (8 GB) / Intel\u00ae ArcTM A580 (8 GB)\n    * DirectX: Version 12\n    * Storage: 15 GB available space\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSee all\n\n## More from Hooded Horse\n\n#### Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic\n\n-35%\n\n39,99\u20ac\n\n25,99\u20ac\n\n#### Against the Storm\n\n29,99\u20ac\n\n#### Empires of the Undergrowth\n\n-35%\n\n29,99\u20ac\n\n19,49\u20ac\n\n#### Terra Invicta\n\n-30%\n\n39,99\u20ac\n\n27,99\u20ac\n\n#### Clanfolk\n\n-40%\n\n29,99\u20ac\n\n17,99\u20ac\n\n#### Xenonauts 2\n\n39,99\u20ac\n\n#### Old World\n\n39,99\u20ac\n\n#### Sons of Valhalla\n\n19,99\u20ac\n\n#### NEBULOUS: Fleet Command\n\n29,99\u20ac\n\n#### Old World - Wonders and Dynasties\n\n19,99\u20ac\n\n#### Old World - Pharaohs of the Nile\n\n9,99\u20ac\n\n#### Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic - Help for Ukraine\n\n4,99\u20ac\n\nSee all\n\n## More like this\n\n#### RimWorld\n\n31,99\u20ac\n\n#### Pioneers of Pagonia\n\n-15%\n\n29,99\u20ac\n\n25,49\u20ac\n\n#### Farthest Frontier\n\n-15%\n\n29,50\u20ac\n\n25,07\u20ac\n\n#### Going Medieval\n\n-20%\n\n24,49\u20ac\n\n19,59\u20ac\n\n#### Stronghold: Definitive Edition\n\n14,99\u20ac\n\n#### Of Life and Land\n\n24,50\u20ac\n\n#### Songs of Syx\n\n24,50\u20ac\n\n#### Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition\n\n-50%\n\n19,99\u20ac\n\n9,99\u20ac\n\n#### Laysara: Summit Kingdom\n\n19,50\u20ac\n\n#### Frostpunk\n\n-80%\n\n29,99\u20ac\n\n5,99\u20ac\n\n#### Infection Free Zone\n\n24,99\u20ac\n\n#### The Wandering Village\n\n-25%\n\n24,99\u20ac\n\n18,74\u20ac\n\nView all\n\n## What Curators Say\n\n117 Curators have reviewed this product.
