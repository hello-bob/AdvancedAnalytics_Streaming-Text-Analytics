And I say that\nwith a great deal of respect. He is the kind of programmer who is hard at work\nbuilding the future, and making useful things so that people can do stuff. He\nis the guy you want on your team building go-carts, because he has two\nfavorite tools: duct tape and WD-40. And he will wield them elegantly even as\nyour go-cart is careening down the hill at a mile a minute. This will happen\nwhile other programmers are still at the starting line arguing over whether to\nuse titanium or some kind of space-age composite material that Boeing is using\nin the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nWhen you are done, you might have a messy go-cart, but it\u2019ll sure as hell fly.\n\nI just read an interview with Jamie in the book Coders at Work, by Peter\nSeibel. Go buy it now. It\u2019s a terrific set of interviews with some great\nprogrammers, including Peter Norvig, Guy Steele, and Donald Knuth. This book\nis so interesting I did 60 minutes on the treadmill yesterday instead of the\nusual 30 because I couldn\u2019t stop reading. Like I said, go buy it.\n\nGo! I\u2019ll wait.\n\nHere is why I like duct tape programmers. Sometimes, you\u2019re on a team, and\nyou\u2019re busy banging out the code, and somebody comes up to your desk, coffee\nmug in hand, and starts rattling on about how if you use multi-threaded COM\napartments, your app will be 34% sparklier, and it\u2019s not even that hard,\nbecause he\u2019s written a bunch of templates, and all you have to do is multiply-\ninherit from 17 of his templates, each taking an average of 4 arguments, and\nyou barely even have to write the body of the function. It\u2019s just a gigantic\nlist of multiple-inheritance from different classes and hey, presto, multi-\napartment threaded COM. And your eyes are swimming, and you have no friggin\u2019\nidea what this frigtard is talking about, but he just won\u2019t go away, and even\nif he does go away, he\u2019s just going back into his office to write more of his\nclever classes constructed entirely from multiple inheritance from templates,\nwithout a single implementation body at all, and it\u2019s going to crash like\ncrazy and you\u2019re going to get paged at night to come in and try to figure it\nout because he\u2019ll be at some goddamn \u201cDesign Patterns\u201d meetup.\n\nAnd the duct-tape programmer is not afraid to say, \u201cmultiple inheritance\nsucks. Stop it. Just stop.\u201d\n\nYou see, everybody else is too afraid of looking stupid because they just\ncan\u2019t keep enough facts in their head at once to make multiple inheritance, or\ntemplates, or COM, or multithreading, or any of that stuff work. So they\nsheepishly go along with whatever faddish programming craziness has come down\nfrom the architecture astronauts who speak at conferences and write books and\narticles and are so much smarter than us that they don\u2019t realize that the\nstuff that they\u2019re promoting is too hard for us.\n\nHere\u2019s what Zawinski says about Netscape: \u201cIt was decisions like not using C++\nand not using threads that made us ship the product on time.\u201d\n\nLater, he wrote an email client at Netscape, but the team that was responsible\nfor actually displaying the message never shipped their component. \u201cThere was\njust this big blank rectangle in the middle of the window where we could only\ndisplay plain text. They were being extremely academic about their project.\nThey were trying to approach it from the DOM/DTD side of things. \u2018Oh, well,\nwhat we need to do is add another abstraction layer here, and have a delegate\nfor this delegate for this delegate. And eventually a character will show up\non the screen.\u2019\u201d\n\nPeter asked Zawinski, \u201cOverengineering seems to be a pet peeve of yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cAt the end of the day, ship the fucking thing! It\u2019s great to\nrewrite your code and make it cleaner and by the third time it\u2019ll actually be\npretty. But that\u2019s not the point\u2014you\u2019re not here to write code; you\u2019re here to\nship products.\u201d\n\nMy hero.\n\nZawinski didn\u2019t do many unit tests. They \u201csound great in principle. Given a\nleisurely development pace, that\u2019s certainly the way to go. But when you\u2019re\nlooking at, \u2018We\u2019ve got to go from zero to done in six weeks,\u2019 well, I can\u2019t do\nthat unless I cut something out. And what I\u2019m going to cut out is the stuff\nthat\u2019s not absolutely critical. And unit tests are not critical. If there\u2019s no\nunit test the customer isn\u2019t going to complain about that.\u201d\n\nRemember, before you freak out, that Zawinski was at Netscape when they were\nchanging the world. They thought that they only had a few months before\nsomeone else came along and ate their lunch. A lot of important code is like\nthat.\n\nDuct tape programmers are pragmatic. Zawinski popularized Richard Gabriel\u2019s\nprecept of Worse is Better. A 50%-good solution that people actually have\nsolves more problems and survives longer than a 99% solution that nobody has\nbecause it\u2019s in your lab where you\u2019re endlessly polishing the damn thing.\nShipping is a feature. A really important feature. Your product must have it.\n\nOne principle duct tape programmers understand well is that any kind of coding\ntechnique that\u2019s even slightly complicated is going to doom your project. Duct\ntape programmers tend to avoid C++, templates, multiple inheritance,\nmultithreading, COM, CORBA, and a host of other technologies that are all\ntotally reasonable, when you think long and hard about them, but are,\nhonestly, just a little bit too hard for the human brain.\n\nSure, there\u2019s nothing officially wrong with trying to write multithreaded code\nin C++ on Windows using COM. But it\u2019s prone to disastrous bugs, the kind of\nbugs that only happen under very specific timing scenarios, because our brains\nare not, honestly, good enough to write this kind of code. Mediocre\nprogrammers are, frankly, defensive about this, and they don\u2019t want to admit\nthat they\u2019re not able to write this super-complicated code, so they let the\nbullies on their team plow away with some godforsaken template architecture in\nC++ because otherwise they\u2019d have to admit that they just don\u2019t feel smart\nenough to use what would otherwise be a perfectly good programming technique\nFOR SPOCK. Duct tape programmers don\u2019t give a shit what you think about them.\nThey stick to simple basic and easy to use tools and use the extra brainpower\nthat these tools leave them to write more useful features for their customers.\n\nOne thing you have to be careful about, though, is that duct tape programmers\nare the software world equivalent of pretty boys... those breathtakingly good-\nlooking young men who can roll out of bed, without shaving, without combing\ntheir hair, and without brushing their teeth, and get on the subway in\nyesterday\u2019s dirty clothes and look beautiful, because that\u2019s who they are.\nYou, my friend, cannot go out in public without combing your hair. It will\nfrighten the children. Because you\u2019re just not that pretty. Duct tape\nprogrammers have to have a lot of talent to pull off this shtick. They have to\nbe good enough programmers to ship code, and we\u2019ll forgive them if they never\nwrite a unit test, or if they xor the \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cprev\u201d pointers of their\nlinked list into a single DWORD to save 32 bits, because they\u2019re pretty\nenough, and smart enough, to pull it off.\n\nDid you buy Coders at Work yet?
