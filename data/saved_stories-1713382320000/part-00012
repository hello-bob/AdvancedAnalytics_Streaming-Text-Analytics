The word has some nuanced additional meanings (including as a\nloanword into English). Traditionally depicted as male, a fl\u00e2neur is an\nambivalent figure of urban affluence and modernity, representing the ability\nto wander detached from society with no other purpose than to be an acute\nobserver of industrialized, contemporary life. Fl\u00e2nerie is the act of\nstrolling, with all of its accompanying associations. A near-synonym of the\nnoun is boulevardier.\n\nThe fl\u00e2neur was first a literary type from 19th-century France, essential to\nany picture of the streets of Paris. The word carried a set of rich\nassociations: the man of leisure, the idler, the urban explorer, the\nconnoisseur of the street. However, the fl\u00e2neur's origins are to be found in\njournalism of the Restoration, and the politics of post-revolutionary public\nspace.^[1] Drawing on the work of Charles Baudelaire who described the fl\u00e2neur\nin his poetry and 1863 essay \"The Painter of Modern Life\", Walter Benjamin\npromoted 20th-century scholarly interest in the fl\u00e2neur as an emblematic\narchetype of urban, modern (even modernist) experience.^[2] Following\nBenjamin, the fl\u00e2neur has become an important symbol for scholars, artists,\nand writers. The classic French female counterpart is the passante, dating to\nthe works of Marcel Proust, though a 21st-century academic coinage is\nfl\u00e2neuse, and some English-language writers simply apply the masculine fl\u00e2neur\nalso to women. The term has acquired an additional architecture and urban\nplanning sense, referring to passers-by who experience incidental or\nintentional psychological effects from the design of a structure.\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\nCharles Baudelaire\n\nFl\u00e2neur derives from the Old Norse verb flana, \"to wander with no\npurpose\".^[3]\n\nThe terms of fl\u00e2nerie date to the 16th or 17th century, denoting strolling,\nidling, often with the connotation of wasting time. But it was in the 19th\ncentury that a rich set of meanings and definitions surrounding the fl\u00e2neur\ntook shape.^[4]\n\nThe fl\u00e2neur was defined in 1872 in a long article in Pierre Larousse's Grand\ndictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle. It described the fl\u00e2neur in ambivalent\nterms, equal parts curiosity and laziness, and presented a taxonomy of\nfl\u00e2nerie: fl\u00e2neurs of the boulevards, of parks, of the arcades, of caf\u00e9s;\nmindless fl\u00e2neurs and intelligent ones.^[5]\n\nBy then, the term had already developed a rich set of associations. Sainte-\nBeuve wrote that to fl\u00e2ne \"is the very opposite of doing nothing\".^[5] Honor\u00e9\nde Balzac described fl\u00e2nerie as \"the gastronomy of the eye\".^[5]^[6] Ana\u00efs\nBazin wrote that \"the only, the true sovereign of Paris is the fl\u00e2neur\".^[5]\nVictor Fournel, in Ce qu'on voit dans les rues de Paris (What One Sees in the\nStreets of Paris, 1867), devoted a chapter to \"the art of fl\u00e2nerie\". For\nFournel, there was nothing lazy in fl\u00e2nerie. It was, rather, a way of\nunderstanding the rich variety of the city landscape; it was like \"a mobile\nand passionate photograph\" (\"un daguerr\u00e9otype mobile et passion\u00e9\") of urban\nexperience.^[7]\n\nWith Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Man of the Crowd\", the fl\u00e2neur entered\nthe literary scene. Charles Baudelaire discusses \"The Man of the Crowd\" in\n\"The Painter of Modern Life\";^[8] it would go on to become a key example in\nWalter Benjamin's essay \"On Some Motifs in Baudelaire\", which theorizes the\nrole of the crowd in modernity.^[9] In the 1860s, in the midst of the\nrebuilding of Paris under Napoleon III and the Baron Haussmann, Charles\nBaudelaire presented a memorable portrait of the fl\u00e2neur as the artist-poet of\nthe modern metropolis:^[10]\n\n> The crowd is his element, as the air is that of birds and water of fishes.\n> His passion and his profession are to become one flesh with the crowd. For\n> the perfect fl\u00e2neur, for the passionate spectator, it is an immense joy to\n> set up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the ebb and flow of\n> movement, in the midst of the fugitive and the infinite. To be away from\n> home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home; to see the world, to be at\n> the centre of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world\u2014impartial\n> natures which the tongue can but clumsily define. The spectator is a prince\n> who everywhere rejoices in his incognito. The lover of life makes the whole\n> world his family, just like the lover of the fair sex who builds up his\n> family from all the beautiful women that he has ever found, or that are or\n> are not\u2014to be found; or the lover of pictures who lives in a magical society\n> of dreams painted on canvas. Thus, the lover of universal life enters into\n> the crowd as though it were an immense reservoir of electrical energy. Or we\n> might liken him to a mirror as vast as the crowd itself; or to a\n> kaleidoscope gifted with consciousness, responding to each one of its\n> movements and reproducing the multiplicity of life and the flickering grace\n> of all the elements of life.\n\nBut Baudelaire's association of the fl\u00e2neur with artists and the world of art\nhas been questioned.^[11]\n\nDrawing on Fournel, and on his analysis of the poetry of Baudelaire, Walter\nBenjamin described the fl\u00e2neur as the essential figure of the modern urban\nspectator, an amateur detective and investigator of the city. More than this,\nhis fl\u00e2neur was a sign of the alienation of the city. ^[clarification needed]\nFor Benjamin, the fl\u00e2neur met his demise with the triumph of consumer\ncapitalism.^[12]\n\nIn these texts, the fl\u00e2neur was often juxtaposed and contrasted with the\nfigure of the badaud, the gawker or gaper. Fournel wrote: \"The fl\u00e2neur must\nnot be confused with the badaud; a nuance should be observed there .... The\nsimple fl\u00e2neur is always in full possession of his individuality, whereas the\nindividuality of the badaud disappears. It is absorbed by the outside world\n... which intoxicates him to the point where he forgets himself. Under the\ninfluence of the spectacle which presents itself to him, the badaud becomes an\nimpersonal creature; he is no longer a human being, he is part of the public,\nof the crowd.\"^[13]^[2]\n\nIn the decades since Benjamin, the fl\u00e2neur has been the subject of a\nremarkable number of appropriations and interpretations. The figure of the\nfl\u00e2neur has been used\u2014among other things \u2013 to explain modern, urban\nexperience, to explain urban spectatorship, to explain the class tensions and\ngender divisions of the nineteenth-century city, to describe modern\nalienation, to explain the sources of mass culture, to explain the postmodern\nspectatorial gaze.^[14] And it has served as a source of inspiration to\nwriters and artists.\n\n## Female counterparts[edit]\n\nThe historical feminine rough equivalent of the fl\u00e2neur, the passante (French\nfor 'walker', 'passer-by'), appears in particular in the work of Marcel\nProust. He portrayed several of his female characters as elusive, passing\nfigures, who tended to ignore his obsessive (and at times possessive) view of\nthem. Increasing freedoms and social innovations such as industrialization\nlater allowed the passante to become an active participant in the 19th century\nmetropolis, as women's social roles expanded away from the domestic and the\nprivate, into the public and urban spheres.\n\nTwenty-first-century literary criticism and gender studies scholarship has\nproposed fl\u00e2neuse for the female equivalent of the fl\u00e2neur, with some\nadditional feminist re-analysis.^[15]^[16]^[17]^[18]^[19] This proposal\nderives from the argument that women conceived and experienced public space\ndifferently from men in modern cities. Janet Wolff, in The Invisible Fl\u00e2neuse:\nWomen and the Literature of Modernity (1985), argues that the female figure of\nthe fl\u00e2neuse is absent in the literature of modernity, because public space\nhad been gendered in modernity, leading, in turn, women's exclusion from\npublic spaces to domestic spaces and suburbs.^[17] Elizabeth Wilson, on the\nother hand, in The Sphinx in the City: Urban Life, the Control of Disorder,\nand Women (1991), points out women's diverse experiences in public space in\nthe modern metropolises such as London, Paris, Vienna, Berlin, discussing how\nthe modern city was conceived as a place of freedom, autonomy, and pleasure,\nand how women experienced these spaces.^[18] Linda McDowell, in Gender,\nIdentity and Place: Understanding Feminist Geographies (1999), expands this\nunderstanding to explain how public space was not experienced as a homogeneous\nand fixed space, and how women used particular public spaces such as beaches,\ncaf\u00e9s, and shopping malls to experience this autonomy.^[19] Departing from\nWilson's approach, Lauren Elkin's Fl\u00e2neuse: Women Walk the City in Paris, New\nYork, Tokyo, Venice, and London (2017) traces a number of fl\u00e2neuse women in\nhistory, such as Agn\u00e8s Varda, Sophie Calle, Virginia Woolf, Martha Gellhorn,\nfocusing on their particular relationships with particular cities.^[15]\n\nIn less academic contexts, such as newspaper book reviews, the grammatically\nmasculine fl\u00e2neur is also applied to women (including modern ones) in\nessentially the same senses as for the original male referents, at least in\nEnglish-language borrowings of the term.^[20] However, as these feminist\nscholars have argued, the word 'fl\u00e2neuse' implies women's distinctive\nmodalities of conceiving, interacting, occupying, and experiencing space.\n\n## Urban life[edit]\n\nGustave Caillebotte. Paris Street, Rainy Day, 1877. Art Institute of\nChicago.Gustave Caillebotte, Le Pont de l'Europe, oil on canvas, 1876. Mus\u00e9e\ndu Petit Palais, Geneva.\n\nWhile Baudelaire characterized the fl\u00e2neur as a \"gentleman stroller of city\nstreets\",^[21] he saw him as having a key role in understanding, participating\nin, and portraying the city. A fl\u00e2neur thus played a double role in city life\nand in theory, that is, while remaining a detached observer. This stance,\nsimultaneously part of and apart from, combines sociological, anthropological,\nliterary, and historical notions of the relationship between the individual\nand the greater populace.^[22]\n\nIn the period after the French Revolution of 1848, during which the Empire was\nreestablished with clearly bourgeois pretensions of \"order\" and \"morals\",\nBaudelaire began asserting that traditional art was inadequate for the new\ndynamic complications of modern life. Social and economic changes brought by\nindustrialization demanded that the artist immerse himself in the metropolis\nand become, in Baudelaire's phrase, \"a botanist of the sidewalk\".^[21] David\nHarvey asserts that \"Baudelaire would be torn the rest of his life between the\nstances of fl\u00e2neur and dandy, a disengaged and cynical voyeur on the one hand,\nand man of the people who enters into the life of his subjects with passion on\nthe other\".^[23]\n\nThe observer\u2013participant dialectic is evidenced in part by the dandy culture.\nHighly self-aware, and to a certain degree flamboyant and theatrical, dandies\nof the mid-nineteenth century created scenes through self-consciously\noutrageous acts like walking turtles on leashes down the streets of Paris.\nSuch acts exemplify a fl\u00e2neur's active participation in and fascination with\nstreet life while displaying a critical attitude towards the uniformity,\nspeed, and anonymity of modern life in the city.\n\nThe concept of the fl\u00e2neur is important in academic discussions of the\nphenomenon of modernity. While Baudelaire's aesthetic and critical visions\nhelped open up the modern city as a space for investigation, theorists such as\nGeorg Simmel began to codify the urban experience in more sociological and\npsychological terms. In his essay \"The Metropolis and Mental Life\", Simmel\ntheorized that the complexities of the modern city create new social bonds and\nnew attitudes towards others. The modern city was transforming humans, giving\nthem a new relationship to time and space, inculcating in them a \"blas\u00e9\nattitude\", and altering fundamental notions of freedom and being:^[24]\n\n> The deepest problems of modern life derive from the claim of the individual\n> to preserve the autonomy and individuality of his existence in the face of\n> overwhelming social forces, of historical heritage, of external culture, and\n> of the technique of life. The fight with nature which primitive man has to\n> wage for his bodily existence attains in this modern form its latest\n> transformation. The eighteenth century called upon man to free himself of\n> all the historical bonds in the state and in religion, in morals and in\n> economics. Man's nature, originally good and common to all, should develop\n> unhampered. In addition to more liberty, the nineteenth century demanded the\n> functional specialization of man and his work; this specialization makes one\n> individual incomparable to another, and each of them indispensable to the\n> highest possible extent. However, this specialization makes each man the\n> more directly dependent upon the supplementary activities of all others.\n> Nietzsche sees the full development of the individual conditioned by the\n> most ruthless struggle of individuals; socialism believes in the suppression\n> of all competition for the same reason. Be that as it may, in all these\n> positions the same basic motive is at work: the person resists being leveled\n> down and worn out by a social-technological mechanism. An inquiry into the\n> inner meaning of specifically modern life and its products, into the soul of\n> the cultural body, so to speak, must seek to solve the equation which\n> structures like the metropolis set up between the individual and the super-\n> individual contents of life.\n\nWriting in 1962, Cornelia Otis Skinner suggested that there was no English\nequivalent of the term: \"there is no Anglo-Saxon counterpart of that\nessentially Gallic individual, the deliberately aimless pedestrian,\nunencumbered by any obligation or sense of urgency, who, being French and\ntherefore frugal, wastes nothing, including his time which he spends with the\nleisurely discrimination of a gourmet, savoring the multiple flavors of his\ncity.\"^[25]\n\n## Architecture and urban planning[edit]\n\nThe concept of the fl\u00e2neur has also become meaningful in the psychogeography\nof architecture and urban planning, describing people who are indirectly and\n(usually) unintentionally affected by a particular design they experience only\nin passing.\n\nIn 1917, the Swiss writer Robert Walser published a short story called \"Der\nSpaziergang\" (\"The Walk\"),^[26] a veritable outcome of the fl\u00e2neur literature.\n\nWalter Benjamin adopted the concept of the urban observer both as an\nanalytical tool and as a lifestyle. From his Marxist standpoint, Benjamin\ndescribes the fl\u00e2neur as a product of modern life and the Industrial\nRevolution without precedent, a parallel to the advent of the tourist. His\nfl\u00e2neur is an uninvolved but highly perceptive bourgeois dilettante. Benjamin\nbecame his own prime example, making social and aesthetic observations during\nlong walks through Paris. Even the title of his unfinished Arcades Project\ncomes from his affection for covered shopping streets.^[27]\n\n> The crowd was the veil from behind which the familiar city as phantasmagoria\n> beckoned to the fl\u00e2neur. In it, the city was now landscape, now a room. And\n> both of these went into the construction of the department store, which made\n> use of fl\u00e2nerie itself in order to sell goods. The department store was the\n> fl\u00e2neur's final coup. As fl\u00e2neurs, the intelligentsia came into the market\n> place. As they thought, to observe it \u2013 but in reality it was already to\n> find a buyer. In this intermediary stage ... they took the form of the\n> boh\u00e8me. To the uncertainty of their economic position corresponded the\n> uncertainty of their political function.\n\nIn the context of modern-day architecture and urban planning, designing for\nfl\u00e2neurs is one way to approach the psychological aspects of the built\nenvironment.^[28]\n\n## Photography[edit]\n\nThe fl\u00e2neur's tendency toward detached but aesthetically attuned observation\nhas brought the term into the literature of photography, particularly street\nphotography. The street photographer is seen as one modern extension of the\nurban observer described by nineteenth century journalist Victor Fournel\nbefore the advent of the hand-held camera:^[29]^[page needed]\n\n> This man is a roving and impassioned daguerreotype that preserves the least\n> traces, and on which are reproduced, with their changing reflections, the\n> course of things, the movement of the city, the multiple physiognomy of the\n> public spirit, the confessions, antipathies, and admirations of the crowd.\n\nAn application of fl\u00e2neur to street photography comes from Susan Sontag in her\n1977 collection of essays, On Photography. She describes how, since the\ndevelopment of hand-held cameras in the early 20th century, the camera has\nbecome the tool of the fl\u00e2neur:^[30]\n\n> The photographer is an armed version of the solitary walker reconnoitering,\n> stalking, cruising the urban inferno, the voyeuristic stroller who discovers\n> the city as a landscape of voluptuous extremes. Adept of the joys of\n> watching, connoisseur of empathy, the fl\u00e2neur finds the world \"picturesque.\"\n\n## Other uses[edit]\n\nThe fl\u00e2neur concept is not limited to someone committing the physical act of a\nperipatetic stroll in the Baudelairian sense, but can also include a \"complete\nphilosophical way of living and thinking\", and a process of navigating\nerudition as described by Nassim Nicholas Taleb's essay \"Why I Do All This\nWalking, or How Systems Become Fragile\".^[31] Taleb further set this term with\na positive connotation referring to anyone pursuing open, flexible plans, in\nopposition to the negative \"touristification\", which he defines as the pursuit\nof an overly orderly plan.^[32] Louis Menand, in seeking to describe the poet\nT. S. Eliot's relationship to English literary society and his role in the\nformation of modernism, describes Eliot as a fl\u00e2neur.^[33] Moreover, in one of\nEliot's well-known poems, \"The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock\", the\nprotagonist takes the reader for a journey through his city in the manner of a\nfl\u00e2neur.\n\nUsing the term more critically, in \"De Profundis\", Oscar Wilde wrote from\nprison about his life regrets, stating: \"I let myself be lured into long\nspells of senseless and sensual ease. I amused myself with being a flaneur, a\ndandy, a man of fashion. I surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the\nmeaner minds.\"^[34]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Aestheticism\n  * Decadent movement\n  * D\u00e9rive\n  * The Idler (1993)\n  * Mopery\n  * People-watching\n  * Vagrancy - Drifter, a person who moves or drifts from place to place\n  * Wandervogel\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Richard Wrigley, \u2018The fl\u00e2neur in the Restoration, or the politics of strolling\u2019, Annales Benjamin Constant, 41, 2016, pp. 119-30\n  2. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Shaya 2004.\n  3. ^ \"flaneur\".
