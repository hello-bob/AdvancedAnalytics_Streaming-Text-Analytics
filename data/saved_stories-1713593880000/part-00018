These groups have so far been less active during the\ncurrent election cycle than they were during previous ones, likely because of\na less contested primary season.\n\n## Stoking divisions\n\nOver the past 45 days, the groups have seeded a growing number of social media\nposts and fake news articles that attempt to foment opposition to US support\nof Ukraine and stoke divisions over hot-button issues such as election fraud.\nThe influence campaigns also promote questions about President Biden\u2019s mental\nhealth and corrupt judges. In all, Microsoft has tracked scores of such\noperations in recent weeks.\n\nIn a report published Wednesday, the Microsoft analysts wrote:\n\n> The deteriorated geopolitical relationship between the United States and\n> Russia leaves the Kremlin with little to lose and much to gain by targeting\n> the US 2024 presidential election. In doing so, Kremlin-backed actors\n> attempt to influence American policy regarding the war in Ukraine, reduce\n> social and political support to NATO, and ensnare the United States in\n> domestic infighting to distract from the world stage. Russia\u2019s efforts thus\n> far in 2024 are not novel, but rather a continuation of a decade-long\n> strategy to \u201cwin through the force of politics, rather than the politics of\n> force,\u201d or active measures. Messaging regarding Ukraine\u2014via traditional\n> media and social media\u2014picked up steam over the last two months with a mix\n> of covert and overt campaigns from at least 70 Russia-affiliated activity\n> sets we track.\n\nThe most prolific of the influence-peddling groups, Microsoft said, is tied to\nthe Russian Presidential Administration, which according to the Marshall\nCenter think tank, is a secretive institution that acts as the main gatekeeper\nfor President Vladimir Putin. The affiliation highlights \u201cthe increasingly\ncentralized nature of Russian influence campaigns,\u201d a departure from campaigns\nin previous years that primarily relied on intelligence services and a group\nknown as the Internet Research Agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEach Russian actor has shown the capability and willingness to target\nEnglish-speaking\u2014and in some cases Spanish-speaking\u2014audiences in the US,\npushing social and political disinformation meant to portray Ukrainian\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy as unethical and incompetent, Ukraine as a\npuppet or failed state, and any American aid to Ukraine as directly supporting\na corrupt and conspiratorial regime,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nAn example is Storm-1516, the name Microsoft uses to track a group seeding\nanti-Ukraine narratives through US Internet and media sources. Content,\npublished in English, Russian, French, Arabic, and Finnish, frequently\noriginates through disinformation seeded by a purported whistleblower or\ncitizen journalist over a purpose-built video channel and then picked up by a\nnetwork of Storm-1516-controlled websites posing as independent news sources.\nThese fake news sites reside in the Middle East and Africa as well as in the\nUS, with DC Weekly, Miami Chronicle, and the Intel Drop among them.\n\nEventually, once the disinformation has circulated in subsequent days, US\naudiences begin amplifying it, in many cases without being aware of the\noriginal source. The following graphic illustrates the flow.\n\nEnlarge / Storm-1516 process for laundering anti-Ukraine disinformation.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWednesday\u2019s report also referred to another group tracked as Storm-1099, which\nis best known for a campaign called Doppelganger. According to the\ndisinformation research group Disinfo Research Lab, the campaign has targeted\nmultiple countries since 2022 with content designed to undermine support for\nUkraine and sow divisions among audiences. Two US outlets tied to Storm-1099\nare Election Watch and 50 States of Lie, Microsoft said. The image below shows\ncontent recently published by the outlets:\n\nEnlarge / Storm-1099 sites.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWednesday\u2019s report also touched on two other Kremlin-tied operations. One\nattempts to revive a campaign perpetuated by NABU Leaks, a website that\npublished content alleging then-Vice President Joe Biden colluded with former\nUkrainian leader Petro Poroshenko, according to Reuters. In January, Andrei\nDerkoch\u2014the ex-Ukrainian Parliamentarian and US-sanctioned Russian agent\nresponsible for NABU Leaks\u2014reemerged on social media for the first time in two\nyears. In an interview, Derkoch propagated both old and new claims about Biden\nand other US political figures.\n\nThe other operation follows a playbook known as hack and leak, in which\noperatives obtain private information through hacking and leak it to news\noutlets.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n138\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
