Due to long-standing issues\nwith sudo, Lennart wrote of run0:\n\n> There's a new tool in systemd, called \"run0\". Or actually, it's not a new\n> tool, it's actually the long existing tool \"systemd-run\", but when invoked\n> under the \"run0\" name (via a symlink) it behaves a lot like a sudo clone.\n> But with one key difference: it's *not* in fact SUID. Instead it just asks\n> the service manager to invoke a command or shell under the target user's\n> UID. It allocates a new PTY for that, and then shovels data back and forth\n> from the originating TTY and this PTY. Or in other words: the target command\n> is invoked in an isolated exec context, freshly forked off PID 1, without\n> inheriting any context from the client (well, admittedly, we *do* propagate\n> $TERM, but that's an explicit exception, i.e. allowlist rather than\n> denylist).\n>\n> One could say, \"run0\" is closer to behaviour of \"ssh\" than to \"sudo\", in\n> many ways. ... The tool is also a lot more fun to use than sudo. For\n> example, by default it will tint your terminal background in a reddish tone\n> while you are operating with elevated privileges. That is supposed to act as\n> a friendly reminder that you haven't given up the privileges yet, and marks\n> the output of all commands that ran with privileges appropriately\n\nThose wishing to learn more about systemd's run0 as a sudo alternative can see\nmore of Lennart's commentary on Mastodon.social.\n\n40 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nSystemd 256-rc1 Brings A Huge Number Of New Features\n\nsystemd In 2023 Added Windows-Inspired \"Blue Screen Of Death\" & macOS-Inspired\nT.D.M.\n\nsystemd 255 Released With A \"Blue Screen of Death\" For Linux Systems\n\nsystemd 255-rc1 Brings \"Blue Screen of Death\" Support & New Tool To Spawn VMs\n\nSystemd Working On \"Storage Target Mode\" Feature - Inspired By Apple macOS\n\nsystemd's All Systems Go Conference Returns Next Week\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
