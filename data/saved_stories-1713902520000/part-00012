Since 2020, residential rates of the two largest investor-owned\nutilities \u2013 PG&E and Southern California Edison \u2013 have risen, respectively, by\n38% and 40% after adjusting for inflation. Inflation adjusted rates of San\nDiego Gas & Electric, the third largest, have only risen 11% during that time,\nbut SDG&E was already the most expensive in 2020. The prices of all three are\nnow more than double the national average. (There are going to be a lot of\nnumbers in this post. If you want the details behind them, this link has a\ndata appendix with the data and code for my calculations.)\n\n(Source)\n\nThere\u2019s also been a lot of finger-pointing about the cause of these increases.\nSome have said it\u2019s the greedy utilities. Others have pointed to the huge\ncosts of addressing the impacts of climate change on California, particularly\nincreased wildfire risk. Still others suggest that a major part of\nCalifornia\u2019s strategy to slow climate change \u2013 decarbonizing our grid \u2013 is\nturning out to be exorbitantly expensive, though there is scant evidence of\nthis.\n\n\u2014\n\nA rate increase multiplier\n\nRegardless of what is driving utility costs higher, their impact on rates is\nmultiplied when customers install their own generation and buy fewer\nkilowatts-hours from the grid. That\u2019s because those households \u2013 whether they\nare customers of the utility or of a community choice aggregator \u2013 contribute\nless towards all of the fixed costs in the system, such as vegetation\nmanagement, grid hardening, distribution line undergrounding, EV charging\nstations, subsidies for low income customers, energy efficiency programs, and\nthe poles and wires that we all rely on whether we are taking electricity off\nthe grid or putting it onto the grid from our rooftop PV systems.\n\nSince those fixed costs still need to be paid, rates go up, shifting costs\nonto the kWhs still being bought from the grid. This will be less true for\nsystems registered after last April when compensation for new systems was made\nsomewhat less generous, but that applies to almost none of the systems\ninstalled before 2024, which are the ones I am studying here.)\n\n\u2014\n\nA decade ago, this was a small concern, because rooftop solar was barely a\nblip in the total supply picture. In 2014, the homes served by these three\nIOUs got less than 2% of their electricity off their roofs. Today they get\nabout 20%. As fewer kWhs are sold from the grid, retail rates must rise even\nmore in order to recover the fixed costs of the system.\n\nThe problem has become particularly acute in the last four years. During that\ntime, solar capacity on houses has more than doubled at the same time that the\nutilities\u2019 fixed costs have escalated dramatically due in large part to\nwildfires and the need for grid hardening against them.\n\n\u2014\n\nFiguring the rooftop solar cost shift\n\nWhat has this done to rates? That takes a lot of calculations, which I detail\nin the available data appendix. But it turns out that three numbers are the\nmajor determinants: the total revenue the utility is permitted to collect from\nresidential customers to cover its operating and fixed costs (known as the\nrevenue requirement), the utility savings from selling a customer fewer kWhs\n(known as the avoided cost), and the amount of solar on rooftops that is\nleading to those lower sales.\n\nSince 2020, the real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) revenue requirements of the\nutilities have increased about 25% for residential customers and rooftop solar\nhas grown 114%, but the avoided cost from each kWh coming off those panels has\nhardly changed. So, as higher and higher electricity prices have meant\ncustomers would save more and more for each solar panel installed, the system\nhasn\u2019t been saving any more money per panel when they do, and those extra\ncosts have been shifted onto customers who don\u2019t have solar.\n\n\u2014\n\nCompared to the case in which residential rooftop solar were treated like\nactual producers and paid the competitive value of their generation, my\nanalysis concludes that PG&E residential customers with solar in 2024 will\nshift slightly more than $2 billion of costs to customers paying the utility\nfor their power. For Southern California Edison, it\u2019s around $1.3 billion, and\nfor SDG&E the cost shift will be about $0.5 billion. My findings are largely\nin line with a separate analysis done by the independent Public Advocates\nOffice of the CPUC. (Their headline number \u2013 $6.5 billion for the total cost\nshift \u2013 differs largely because they include commercial and industrial (C&I)\ncustomers\u2019 solar, which makes up about one-third of distributed solar\ncapacity, and because I use a somewhat more generous avoided cost than their\nanalysis does.)\n\nThe cost shift impact on rates\n\nWhile it might be tempting to compare these astonishing figures to the\nrevenues collected from residential customers, that would implicitly assume\nthat all of these costs are shifted onto the residential price of electricity.\nIn reality, some costs are shifted onto C&I customers. How much? That\u2019s hard\nto know. It depends on which costs are allocated to specific customer classes\n(e.g., the cost of distribution lines in residential neighborhoods) and which\nare considered systemwide costs (e.g., the cost of billing systems,\ntransmission lines, etc.).\n\nOne thing we do know is that residential rates have increased faster than C&I\nrates in the last decade. In 2014, PG&E residential rates averaged about 7%\nabove C&I, but by 2024, they were 15% higher. SCE went from a 15% differential\nto a 47% differential over the same time period, while SDG&E\u2019s differential\njumped from 2% to 19%. This suggests that the costs that have been going up\nlately, and the increasing cost shift from distributed solar, have been\nallocated in higher proportion to residential customers. That\u2019s not surprising\ngiven that a lot of the cost increases in the last few years have been\ndefensive investments to harden distribution systems \u2013 which are\ndisproportionately associated with residential customers \u2013 and because homes\nhave two-thirds of the distributed solar.\n\nTo get a feel for the impact, let\u2019s assume that 60%-80% of the cost shift from\nresidential solar goes onto the bills of other residential customers. If so,\nthen 5.7-7.0 cents of the price of each kWh (for customers not on the CARE\nlow-income rate), or 12%-15% of PG&E\u2019s full residential price in 2024, is due\nto the rooftop solar cost shift. For SCE it is 3.2-4.0 cents or 9%-11% of the\nprice. And for SDG&E it is 7.4-8.8 cents or 19%-22% of the price.\n\nIn 2018, Lucas Davis wrote a blog post titled \u201cWhy Am I Paying $65/year for\nYour Solar Panels?\u201d The question is still with us today, except now it\u2019s more\nlike \u201cWhy Am I Paying $300/year for Your Solar Panels?\u201d\n\nGetting to a sustainable energy system\n\nI\u2019m not presenting this analysis in order to demonize solar adopters or to\nmake them feel guilty about their choice. It\u2019s not their responsibility to do\nthis sort of analysis. People are busy and utility bills are a burden for\nmany. I don\u2019t blame them for jumping at an opportunity to save money, without\nworking through where those savings come from. The problem is not in our\nhousehold decision makers, but in our policies. The 2023 change in how new\nsolar installations are compensated was a small step in the right direction,\nbut not a solution.\n\nNor is the solar cost shift the only problem facing California\u2019s electricity\nsystem. Adapting to increased wildfire risk and other impacts of climate\nchange, challenges of maintaining reliability with increased renewables,\ndysfunctional regulation, inefficient utility operations, and excessive\nreturns on capital investments are all contributing to increased rates. All of\nthese issues \u2013 including the exploding solar cost shift \u2013 need honest\ndiscussions among legislators and policymakers if California is going to\nsuccessfully navigate today\u2019s unsustainable rate trends.\n\n\u2014\n\nI am posting frequently these days on Bluesky @severinborenstein\n\nFollow us on Bluesky and LinkedIn, as well as subscribe to our email list to\nkeep up with future content and announcements.\n\nSuggested citation: Borenstein, Severin. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s Exploding Rooftop Solar\nCost Shift\u201d Energy Institute Blog, April 22, 2024,\nhttps://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2024/04/22/californias-exploding-rooftop-\nsolar-cost-shift/\n\nCategories\n\nUncategorized\n\nTags\n\nelectricity, energy efficiency, featured, solar\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Print\n  * More\n\n  * Pocket\n  * Pinterest\n  * Reddit\n  * Tumblr\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\n#### What Put California at the Top of Residential Solar?\n\nSteeply tiered rates likely provided more incentive than the California Solar\nInitiative.
