A recent\naddition to Tecan\u2019s offerings is the Phase Separator, a pipetting utility of\nthe Air Flexible Channel Arm on Tecan\u2019s flagship liquid handling platform, the\nFluent Automation Workstation. This combination of technologies can increase\nthe speed and accuracy of liquid separation applications in liquid biopsy and\nbiobanking applications. For example, the platform can extract plasma from 24\ntubes of centrifuged blood in 10 minutes.\n\nThe progress in laboratory automation could be one of the most consistent\nchanges in research in the life sciences and biomedicine over the past 30\nyears. The evolution of this field borders on the miraculous. That\nperspective, though, comes from someone who is old enough to remember\npipetting with a rubber bulb and analyzing data with a calculator\u2014laboratory\ntasks that used to be common but are seldom performed by today\u2019s scientists.\nTo get a modern angle on the advances in laboratory automation, GEN reached\nout to a group of experts.\n\nThese experts describe a range of challenges that drive today\u2019s laboratory\nautomation landscape and how they are being solved. Not surprisingly, a rubber\nbulb is not part of any of today\u2019s solutions. Instead, companies create\nsystems of automation, often supported by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n#### Automation in an ecosystem\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s key to understand that automation can\u2019t function in isolation,\u201d says\nCarola Schmidt, general manager of automated robotic systems, Revvity. \u201cTrue\nautomation in laboratory workflows requires seamless integration of the\nrelevant instrumentation technology and the associated software, reagents, and\nconsumables. Integrated automation that connects multiple steps in the\nlaboratory\u2019s workflow enables a reduction in manual workload and frees up time\nfor the scientists to focus on research and innovation.\u201d\n\nCollaboration is central to automating laboratory processes effectively. \u201cThe\nconcept of collaboration goes beyond merely offering automated services and\ntools,\u201d Schmidt explains. \u201cIt also requires growing with the evolution of a\ncompany or laboratory to better meet its needs. For instance, we acquired\nOxford Immunotec, which is now rebranded into Revvity and plays a global role\nin fighting tuberculosis.\u201d With that acquisition and Revvity\u2019s expertise in\nautomation, the company, Schmidt says, is \u201cable to provide customers with\nfully automated workflows for tuberculosis testing.\u201d She adds that such\nworkflows could bring advanced tuberculosis testing to more people around the\nworld.\n\nOther diagnostic technologies also move ahead with automation. For example,\nthe UNIQO 160 from Revvity\u2019s EUROIMMUN business fully automates indirect\nimmunofluorescence diagnostics. \u201cIt\u2019s traceable with barcodes and can process\nup to 160 primary samples and 18 slides,\u201d Schmidt asserts. \u201cMoreover, it can\nbe processed in one run on the compact benchtop device, which generates high-\nquality images and enables reliable AI-based results.\u201d\n\nIn fact, AI can improve laboratory automation in many ways. As examples,\nSchmidt mentions rule-based decision making, pattern recognition, and image\nanalysis. \u201cIn its more advanced forms, AI capabilities built into laboratory\nsoftware and instrumentation can aid in sample handling and other manual\nprocesses carried out by robotic systems,\u201d she says. \u201cAI can offer guidance,\npropose a workflow, and reduce errors, but at the end of the day, a human\ndetermines the outcome.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, liquid handling makes up the heart of laboratory automation.\nLast summer, Revvity launched the Fontus Automated Liquid Handling\nWorkstation. According to Schmidt, this platform is \u201csuited for a range of\nliquid-handling applications and will be especially valuable in this climate\nwhere the supply of talented laboratory personnel is limited\u2014even though more\nwork needs to be accomplished in a timely manner.\u201d\n\n#### Addressing underutilization\n\nAll laboratories hope to make the most of their assets, but doing so is\nchallenging. Turnovers and shortages in personnel create key challenges.\n\n\u201cSome laboratories lack the trained personnel required to operate their\nsystems, leading to underutilization of automation solutions,\u201d says Hal\nWehrenberg, head of product management, Tecan. \u201cUsability directly impacts the\nability to quickly train teams and redeploy resources.\u201d Consequently,\nWehrenberg points out that usability is crucial to clearing the\nunderutilization hurdle.\n\nTecan continually enhances its Fluent Automation Workstation with more\nflexible features, such as the improved Air FCA (Flexible Channel Arm) with\nMultiSense technology, which provides AI-based pressure monitor pipetting\n(PMP-AI). \u201cPMP-AI uses neural networks to interpret pressure curves, helping\nto identify pipetting anomalies and mitigate the risk presented with\nchallenging samples like whole blood,\u201d Wehrenberg explains. In addition, this\nplatform\u2019s Phase Separator \u201cis a unique, pressure-based capability of the\npipetting arm, which works across all eight pipetting channels in parallel,\nindependently detecting the interfaces between liquid layers while\naspirating,\u201d Wehrenberg notes. \u201cThis is an ideal solution for workflows like\nplasma separation from centrifuged blood samples.\u201d\n\nTecan used machine learning in the development of the new Air FCA. For\nexample, \u201cthe Phase Separator technology uses advanced data analysis\ntechniques,\u201d Wehrenberg says. \u201cBy continually monitoring pressure measurements\nduring aspiration, it is possible to automate the identification and the\nseparation of liquid fractions based on their different viscosities.\u201d\n\nTecan\u2019s Fluent platforms also include DeckCheck, which Wehrenberg describes as\n\u201ca camera-enabled feature that helps avoid errors that could impact a run.\u201d To\ndo this, he says, \u201cit displays discrepancies, such as missing plates or\nincorrectly loaded tip boxes, allowing the operator to correct the error,\navoiding the risk of failed runs.\u201d\n\nThe company also applied machine learning to DeckCheck. \u201cThe goal was simple:\nimprove the end user experience and eliminate failed runs,\u201d Wehrenberg\ndeclares. \u201cThis required large amounts of data, including data in the form of\nimages of our Fluent systems with various segments, labware, and runners in a\nwide range of lighting conditions.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the system \u201ccan compare a live image with a reference image,\nidentify discrepancies, and alert the user to act,\u201d Wehrenberg says. \u201cThis\nlive image analysis feature would not have been possible without the\nadvancements and proper implementation of AI in our product development\nprogram.\u201d\n\n#### Seeking sustainable solutions\n\n\u201cOne of today\u2019s biggest challenges in advancing laboratory automation revolves\naround integrating sustainable practices and reducing environmental impact\nwhile maintaining efficiency and accuracy,\u201d says Thomas Deutschmann, vice\npresident of product development life sciences instruments at QIAGEN.\n\u201cTraditional laboratories often face issues like wastage of reagents, single-\nuse plastics, and high water and energy consumption.\u201d\n\nIn November, QIAGEN launched its QIAcuity Digital PCR kits. These kits can be\nused in QIAGEN\u2019s QIAcuity systems, which can be applied in applications from\ncell and gene therapy production to food safety assurance. For example, the\nQIAcuity Mycoplasma Quant kit detects contaminants in the production of cell\nand gene therapies.\n\nQIAGEN takes on the sustainability challenges in several ways. For example,\nQIAGEN has developed a portfolio of purification kits called QIAwave. \u201cThese\nkits,\u201d Deutschmann says, \u201creduce the use of plastics by up to 62% and\ncardboard by up to 58% compared to QIAGEN standard kits.\u201d Nonetheless, all of\nthese kits use the same chemistry and provide the same performance. The\nQIAwave kits, though, consist of fewer components. Waste tubes are made from\n100% recycled plastic, and bottles containing suitable buffer concentrates are\nsmaller. Deutschmann notes, \u201cWith more compact kits and innovative packaging\nmethods, we can reduce cardboard consumption.\u201d Plus, these kits can be\nautomated.\n\nOn the analytical side, Deutschmann mentions the challenges of automating\nimage analysis associated with digital PCR: \u201cQIAGEN\u2019s QIAcuity Digital PCR\nsystem serves as an example of the complexity that image analysis must manage\nwithin this technology. On a single microplate, the system can process up to\n96 wells, each containing 8,500 partitions.\u201d That\u2019s a lot of imaging to\nanalyze. Accordingly, Deutschmann observes, \u201cEnsuring accurate and efficient\nimage analysis is essential, given the minute scale and complexity of the\nsamples.\u201d\n\nTo take on complex imagery, QIAGEN applied advanced algorithms. \u201cAs we strive\nto continuously improve image analysis, one approach involves training neural\nnetworks to differentiate between valid and invalid partitions,\u201d Deutschmann\nemphasizes. \u201cThis allows for accurate analysis of photographic images of the\nfilled nanoplates, ensuring that all partitions are correctly identified and\nthat potential artifacts, such as dust, are excluded.\u201d\n\n#### Expanding access and integration\n\n\u201cDespite the many modern advancements made in laboratory automation,\naffordable automation is still inaccessible for many laboratories,\u201d says Susan\nMagdaleno, PhD, director of research and translational R&D, sample preparation\ntechnologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific. \u201cThe low-cost sample prep instruments\ncurrently available on the market do not offer a fully automated user\nexperience.\u201d\n\nSo, Thermo Fisher developed advances in its economical liquid handling\nplatforms that \u201callow for low-throughput, walkaway automation from sample to\nquantitation to assay setup to help streamline workflows,\u201d Magdaleno says. \u201cBy\nautomating individual sample handling wherever possible, this reduces user\nerror and removes the tedious workflow steps for the user.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Magdaleno notes that automation-related information could be\nbetter integrated with laboratory information management systems and\nelectronic laboratory notebook systems. Here, she says, Thermo Fisher is\nworking on \u201cfully integrating sample preparation and data capturing of lot\nnumber, quantitation, method, etc.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce information for a sample is entered, it is assigned a barcode and\ntracked from entering the laboratory through sample prep to storage and\ndownstream applications,\u201d Magdaleno says. \u201cIn a perfect world, all instruments\nwould update each sample\u2019s data files with its data/results.\u201d\n\nMagdaleno expects AI to play an increasing role in automation ahead: \u201cFor\nexample, AI could come into play to help interpret video images\u2014like how we\nuse the human eye to ensure we are delivering liquid to a tube with a manual\npipette.\u201d AI can help ensure that liquids are dispensed in the right volumes\nwhere needed.\n\nMagdaleno sees AI coming into automation at the earliest stages of analytical\nprocesses. \u201cThe integration of AI and machine learning into sample prep\ninstruments could really improve the instrument\u2019s ability to detect sample\ntype, optimize extraction protocols, and troubleshoot errors in real time,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cThis could improve the precision and reliability of the process.\u201d\n\n#### Today and tomorrow\n\nAs shown here, laboratory automation continues to provide a range of advances,\nfrom accuracy and asset utilization to productivity and sustainability. As\nSchmidt puts it: \u201cWithout question, automation and data management are making\nroom for innovations, bringing lifesaving therapies to people at a rapid rate\nwithout compromising on quality or accuracy. We are only just scratching the\nsurface.\u201d\n\nInsightsArtificial intelligenceAutomationData managementMachine\nlearningPolymerase chain\nreactionRoboticsSoftwareTuberculosisQiagenRevvityThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nShare\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedin\n\nReddIt\n\nEmail\n\nPrevious articleLaboratory Automation Reaches Every Stage of Drug Development\n\nNext articleShape-Shifting Protein Study Could Lead to Development of New\nDrugs\n\nKathy Vuksanaj\n\n#### Read the Digital Edition\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * About GEN\n  * Contact GEN\n  * GEN Staff\n  * Editorial Guidelines\n  * Reprints and Permissions\n  * Scientific Advisory Board\n\n#### Advertise\n\n  * Media Kit and Planning Calendar\n  * Advertising Terms and Conditions\n\n#### Resources\n\n  * Get the GEN Magazine\n  * Get the GEN Email Newsletter\n  * Inside Precision Medicine\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News.
