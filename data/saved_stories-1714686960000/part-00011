A gaki condemned to shit-eating\nwatches a child wearing geta and holding a ch\u016bgi, c. 12th century.\n\nShit stick means \"a thin stake or stick used instead of toilet paper\" for anal\nhygiene and was a historical item of material culture introduced through\nChinese Buddhism and Japanese Buddhism. A well-known example is\ng\u0101nsh\u01d0ju\u00e9/kanshiketsu (lit. \u4e7e\u5c4e\u6a5b \"dry shit stick\") wato from the Chan/Zen\ng\u014dng'\u00e0n/k\u014dan in which a monk asked \"What is buddha?\" and Master Yunmen/Unmon\nanswered \"A dry shit stick\".\n\n## History[edit]\n\nJapanese ch\u016bgi from the Nara period (710\u2013784), shown with modern toilet paper\nfor size comparison\n\nPeople have used many different materials in the history of anal cleansing,\nincluding leaves, rags, paper, water, sponges, corncobs, and sticks.\n\nAccording to the historians of Chinese science Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-\ndjen,\n\n> In very ancient times, instruments of bamboo, possibly spatulas ([c\u00e8ch\u00f3u]\n> \u5ec1\u7c4c, [c\u00e8b\u00ec] \u5ec1\u7be6, or [c\u00e8ji\u01cen] \u5ec1\u7c21), may have been used with the assistance of\n> water in cleaning the body after defecation. At other times and places, it\n> seems that pieces of earthenware or pottery were so used. Undoubtedly one\n> material which found employment in this respect was waste silk rag.^[1]\n\nWhen monks and missionaries introduced Buddhism into China and Japan, they\nalso brought the Indian custom of using a \u015bal\u0101k\u0101 \"small stake, stick, or rod\"\nfor wiping away excrement. Translators rendered this Sanskrit word into a\nnumber of different neologisms such as Chinese c\u00e8ch\u00f3u \u5ec1\u7c4c and Japanese ch\u016bgi\n(\u7c4c\u6728), and the custom of using shit sticks became popular. They had advantages\nof being inexpensive, washable, and reusable.\n\nThe Chinese invented paper around the 2nd century BCE, and toilet paper no\nlater than the 6th century CE, when Yan Zhitui noted, \"Paper on which there\nare quotations or commentaries from the Five Classics or the names of sages, I\ndare not use for toilet purposes\".^[2]\n\nThe earliest Japanese flush toilets date from the Nara period (710\u2013784), when\na drainage system was constructed in the capital at Nara, with squat toilets\nbuilt over 10\u201315 cm (3.9\u20135.9 in) wide wooden conduits that users would\nstraddle. Archaeological excavations in Nara have also found numerous ch\u016bgi\nwooden sticks that were used for fecal cleansing.^[3] Matsui et al. explain\nthat Japanese archeologists have discovered comparatively few toilets because\n\"the decisive factors in identifying toilets were fly maggots and flat sticks\ncalled chugi used as a toilet paper\", but preservation of such artifacts\nrequires the environment of a wetland site where organic remains are\nconstantly soaked with groundwater.^[4]\n\nArcheologists discovered 2,000-year-old shit sticks in a latrine at\nXuanquanzhi \u60ac\u6cc9\u7f6e, in the town of Dunhuang, Gansu. Xuanquanzhi was a Han dynasty\nmilitary base and relay station (111 BCE \u2013 CE 109) at the eastern end of the\nSilk Road. Analysis of preserved fecal matter found on cloth covers wrapped\naround the ends of sticks revealed the remains of roundworm (Ascaris\nlumbricoides), whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), tapeworm (Taenia solium), and\nChinese liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis).^[5]^[6]^[7]\n\n## Terminology[edit]\n\nThe Chinese and Japanese lexicons have various words meaning \"shit stick\".\nThey are divisible into compounds of ch\u00f3u or ch\u016b \u7c4c \"small stake or stick\", ju\u00e9\nor ketsu \u6a5b \"short stake or stick\", and other terms.\n\n### Chou or Ch\u016b[edit]\n\nMing dynasty Xuande Emperor playing touhu, 15th century\n\nChinese ch\u00f3u or Japanese ch\u016b \u7c4c \"small stake; stick; chip; tally; counter;\ntoken\" is used in the \"shit stick\" terms and ch\u00f3um\u00f9 or ch\u016bgi \u7c4c\u6728 (with \u6728 \"tree;\nwood\") and c\u00e8ch\u00f3u \u5ec1\u7c4c (with \u5ec1 \"toilet\").\n\nCh\u00f3u or ch\u016b was used to translate the polysemous Buddhist Sanskrit term \u015bal\u0101ka\nor \u015bal\u0101k\u0101 (Pali: sal\u0101k\u0101).\n\n> \u015bal\u0101k\u0101 any small stake or stick, rod (for stirring [etc]), twig (smeared\n> with lime for catching birds), rib (of an umbrella), bar (of a cage or\n> window), chip, splinter, splint, pencil (for painting or applying\n> collyrium).\n>\n>   * (1) a piece of bamboo (borne as a kind of credential by mendicants and\n> marked with their name).\n>   * (2) the quill of a porcupine.\n>   * (3) an oblong quadrangular piece of ivory or bone (used in playing a\n> partic[ular] game).\n>   * (4) a peg, pin, arrow-head, needle, a probe (used in surgery and\n> sometimes taken as the N[ame] of this branch of, surgery), any pointed\n> instrument.\n>   * (5) a sprout, sprig, shoot of any kind.\n>   * (6) a ruler.\n>   * (7) a toothpick or tooth-brush.\n>   * (8) a match or thin piece of wood (used for ignition by friction).\n>   * (9) a bone.\n>   * (10) a finger, toe.\n>   * (11) a porcupine.\n>   * (12) a partic[ular] thorny shrub, Vanguieria Spinosa.\n>   * (13) the S\u0101rik\u0101 bird, Turdus salica (syn.

Salaka-Grahapaka was the elected\n\"collector of votes\" in the Santhagara \"general assembly hall used for\nvoting\". The Jain cosmological term salakapurusa \"illustrious or worthy\nperson\" compounds salaka \"stick used for voting\" and purusa \"person\".\n\nChou \u7c4c originally meant \"arrow used in t\u00f3uh\u00fa (ancient drinking game decided by\nthe number of arrows thrown into a pot)\" or \"tally stick (used in counting)\",\nand by extension came to mean \"plan; prepare; collect\".^[11] Ch\u00f3u \u7c4c \"shit\nstick\" was first chronicled around the 3rd century CE. The Jin dynasty\n(266\u2013420) Yulin \u8a9e\u6797 by Pei Qi \u88f4\u555f has stories about the especially ostentatious\nbathrooms of wealthy merchant Shi Chong \u77f3\u5d07 (249\u2013300),^[1] including one about\nShi mocking the politician Liu Shi \u5289\u5bd4 (220\u2013310) for being unfamiliar with the\nperfumed shit sticks offered by two female washroom attendants.^[12]\n\nC\u00e8ch\u00f3u \u5ec1\u7c4c was first recorded in the (c. 659) History of the Northern\nDynasties, when Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi (r. 550\u2013560) said that getting\nYang Yin to serve as Prime Minister was as difficult as making him present\nshit sticks.^[13]\n\nThe Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (2001) defines ch\u016bgi (\u7c4c\u6728) or ch\u016b (\u7c4c) as \"chips of\nwood anciently used instead of toilet paper\", and cites the earliest recorded\nusage of ch\u016bgi \u3061\u3046\u304e in Ono Ranzan's \u5c0f\u91ce\u862d\u5c71 (1847) J\u016btei honz\u014d k\u014dmoku keim\u014d\n(\u91cd\u8a02\u672c\u8349\u7db1\u76ee\u5553\u8499, \"Illuminated Compendium of Materia Medica\"). Modern Japanese\ndialect pronunciations of ch\u016bgi include chy\u014di or ch\u016bge in Hida (region) and\nts\u016b in Iwate Prefecture.\n\nTranslations in English dictionaries of Buddhism include:\n\n  * \u7c4c To calculate, devise, plan; a tally.^[14]\n  * Ch\u016b \u7c4c \u015bal\u0101k\u0101. 1.

A thin piece of wood used for wiping away excrement.^[16]\n\n### Jue or Ketsu[edit]\n\nChinese ju\u00e9 or Japanese ketsu \u6a5b \"short wooden stake; stick; peg; post\" is\ncompounded with shi or sh\u01d0 \u5c4e (written with \u5c38 \"body\" and \u7c73 \"rice\") \"shit;\nexcrement; dung\" into Japanese shiketsu or Chinese sh\u01d0ju\u00e9 \u5c4e\u6a5b \"shit stick\".\n\nThe famous term g\u0101nsh\u01d0ju\u00e9 or kanshiketsu \u4e7e\u5c4e\u6a5b \"dry shit stick\", modified with\ng\u0101n or kan \u4e7e \"dry, dried; hollow\", occurs in a famous Chan g\u014dng'\u00e0n or Zen k\u014dan\nrecorded in The Gateless Gate (see below).\n\nDefinitions in English dictionaries of Buddhism include:\n\n  * \"\u4e7e\u5c4e\u6a5b A stick used in India as 'toilet paper', in China paper, straw, or bamboo.\"^[17]\n  * \"Kan-shiketsu \u4e7e\u5c4e\u6a5b Excrement-wiping spatula.

While most\nJapanese \"shit stick\" words have Sino-Japanese on'yomi readings, such as ch\u016bgi\nfrom ch\u00f3um\u00f9 \u7c4c\u6728, both kuso \u7cde \"shit; crap\" (cf. internet slang kuso) and hera \u7b86\n\"spatula; scoop\" are native Japanese kun'yomi pronunciations of these kanji\n(which would be read funhei \u7cde\u7b86 in Sino-Japanese).\n\nChinese cebi \u5ec1\u7b86 \"toilet spatula\" is first recorded in Buddhabhadra's (c. 419)\nMohe sengqi l\u00fc \u6469\u8a36\u50e7\u7947\u5f8b translation of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika version Vinaya Pitaka\nmonastic rules; the toilet etiquette section (\u660e\u5a01\u5100\u6cd5\u4e4b\u4e00) says inside toilets\nshould have privacy partitions, with cebi shit-sticks placed at the side.^[13]\n\n### Other terms[edit]\n\nChinese c\u00e8ji\u01cen \u5ec1\u7c21 or \u5395\u7b80 \"toilet stick\" is a synonym of c\u00e8ch\u00f3u \u5ec1\u7c4c (above) using\nthe word ji\u01cen \u7c21 \"bamboo and wooden slips used for writing; letter; select;\nchoose; simple; brief\". C\u00e8ji\u01cen was first recorded in the (c. 1105) Book of\nSouthern Tang \"Biographies of Buddhists\" section. During the time of Queen\nZhou the Elder (r. 961\u2013964), a monk used a sharpened toilet stick to remove a\ntumor.^[13] Jabamukhi salaka (also from Sanskrit \u015bal\u0101k\u0101) was \"a curved needle\n(used in traditional Indian cataract surgery)\".\n\n### English counterparts[edit]\n\nThe English language has some shit(e) stick lexical parallels to these Asian\nlanguage terms. The Oxford English Dictionary (s.v. shit, shite n.) quotes two\nearly shit-stick examples: \"a hard chuffe, a shite-sticks\" (1598) and \"a\nshite-sticks, a shite-rags, that is to say, a miserable pinch-pennie\" (1659);\nand (s.v. poop n.^2) defines poop-stick as \"a fool, ineffectual person\", with\nthe earliest usage in 1930. Shit-sticks is metaphorically parallel to shit-\nrags.^[21] In modern usage, Atcheson L. Hench suggests calling someone a shit-\nstick may combine the ideas of shit and stick-in-the-mud.^[22]\n\nThe lexicographer Eric Partridge lists three slang terms.^[23]\n\n  * shit-stick \"a despised person\" (US 1964)\n  * shit sticks! \"used as a mildly profane expression of disappointment\" (US 1964)\n  * shit(ty) end of the stick \"an unfair position to be in; inequitable treatment\" (UK 1974)\n\n## Textual usages[edit]\n\nWords meaning \"shit stick\" are associated with the Chan/Zen school of\nBuddhism. Victor Mair explains that most great masters in this school \"did not\ndirectly state what they wanted to say, but used a conclusive shout or a knock\non the head with a rod, or yet spoke such words as 'dry shit stick' that are\nsituated somewhere between comprehensibility and incomprehensibility in order\nto make a suggestion that would enable their students to partake of\nenlightenment\".^[24]\n\n### The Gateless Gate[edit]\n\nThe Gateless Gate is the Song dynasty Chan master Wumen Huikai's (c. 1228)\ncompilation of 48 k\u014dans. Case 21 is titled Yunmen (kan)shiketsu \u96f2\u9580(\u4e7e)\u5c4e\u6a5b\"\n\"Master Yunmen's (Dried) Shit Stick\", referring to the Tang dynasty Chan\nmaster Yunmen Wenyan (c. 862\u2013949 CE).\n\n> THE CASE\n>\n> A monk asked Y\u00fcn-men, \"What is Buddha?\" [\u96f2\u9580\u56e0\u50e7\u554f\u5982\u4f55\u662f\u4f5b]\n>\n> Y\u00fcn-men said, \"Dried shitstick.\" [\u9580\u4e91\u4e7e\u5c4e\u6a5b]\n>\n> WU-MEN'S COMMENT\n>\n> It must be said of Y\u00fcn-men that he was too poor to prepare even the plainest\n> food and too busy to make a careful draft. Probably people will bring forth\n> this dried shitstick to shore up the gate and prop up the door. The Buddha\n> Dharma is thus sure to decay.\n>\n> WU-MEN'S VERSE^[25]\n>\n> A flash of lightning, sparks from flint; if you blink your eyes, it's\n> already gone.\n\nAitken explains \"dried shitstick\" as \"a soft stick that was used the way our\nancestors used a corncob in their outhouses\".^[26] Jack Kerouac paraphrased\n\"The Buddha is a dried piece of turd\".^[27]\n\nOwing to the ambiguities of Classical Chinese, the word g\u0101nsh\u01d0ju\u00e9 or\nkanshiketsu \u4e7e\u5c4e\u6a5b can be parsed as \"dried shit-stick\" or \"dried-shit stick\".\nEnglish translations include:\n\n  * \"Dried dung.\"^[28]\n  * \"A shit-wiping stick.\"^[29]\n  * \"Kanshiketsu! (a dried shit-stick).\"^[30]\n  * \"Kanshiketsu!\"^[31]\n  * \"Dry shit on a stick!\"^[32]^[33]\n\nSekida and Grimstone note: \"Kanshiketsu. A shiketsu, or 'shit-stick' (kan,\ndry; shi, shit; ketsu, stick), was used in old times instead of toilet paper.\nIt is at once both private and polluted. But in samadhi there is no private or\npublic, no pure or polluted.\"\n\n### Record of Linji[edit]\n\nThe L\u00ednj\u00ec l\u00f9 or Rinzai roku \u81e8\u6fdf\u9304 \"Record of Linji\" contains the compiled\nsayings of the Tang dynasty Chan master Linji Yixuan or Rinzai Gigen (d. 866\nCE). In one famous example of so-called dharma combat, Linji uses the word\nganshijue as an epithet, comparable to \"You shithead!\".^[26]\n\n> The master, taking the high seat in the hall, said, \"On your lump of red\n> flesh is a true man without rank who is always going in and out of the face\n> of every one of you. Those who have not yet confirmed this, look, look!\"\n>\n> Then a monk came forward and asked, \"What about the true man without rank?\"\n>\n> The master got down from his seat, seized the monk, and cried, \"Speak,\n> speak!\"\n>\n> The monk faltered.\n>\n> Shoving him away, the master said, \"The true man without rank\u2014what kind of\n> dried piece of shit is he!\" Then he returned to his quarters.^[34]\n\nIn an editorial note, Kirchner^[35] says Ruth Fuller Sasaki originally\ntranslated Chinese ganshijue \u4e7e\u5c4e\u6a5b as \"shit-wiping stick\", saying that the term\nliterally means a \"cleaning-off-dung-stick\", a smooth stick of bamboo used in\nplace of toilet paper, with \u4e7e being the verb \"to clean\". However, Sasaki\nchanged this to \"dried piece of shit\", following the interpretation of Iriya\nYoshitaka,^[36] an authority on Tang-dynasty slang, that it means \"stick-\nshaped piece of dung\". A comparable usage occurs in the record of Song dynasty\nChan master Dahui Zonggao, Dahui Pujue Chanshi yulu \u5927\u6167\u666e\u89ba\u79aa\u5e2b\u8a9e\u9304, where the two\ncharacters \u5c4e\u9ebc form a noun-compound: \"I say to [such stupid monks], 'You're\nbiting on the dung-sticks of others. You\u2019re not even good dogs!'.\" Sasaki's\nother collaborator, Yanagida Seizan,^[37] interprets the term \u4e7e\u5c4e\u6a5b to mean\n\"useless dung stick\", explaining that \u4e7e does not have its usual meaning of\n\"dry\", but is synonymous with the homophonous \u9591 \"useless\".\n\nTh\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh comments,\n\n> Scholars still aren't sure if the phrase \"a stick of dry fecal matter\" means\n> the fecal matter dries and becomes very hard like a stick or that the monks\n> there used sticks as toilet paper. The Zen master expressed his\n> disappointment but at the same time used an image opposite of the one we\n> have of the true person. We tend to think of a true person as pure and\n> noble, someone extraordinary, so the Zen master uses this image of a dry\n> piece of fecal matter or dried excrement on a stick to neutralize our view.\n> If we have a set view about what our true person is, then that view has no\n> more value than a piece of dry fecal matter.^[38]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Toilets in Japan\n  * Xylospongium\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  * The Gateless Barrier: The Wu-Men Kuan (Mumonkan).
