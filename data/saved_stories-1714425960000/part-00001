If no action is sent within this period, other players\ndo not announce their actions to that player and ignore any action that\narrives too late.\n\n## Asynchronous lockstep protocol[edit]\n\nTo overcome the obvious drawback of the simple lockstep protocol, an\nasynchronous variant of the protocol exists wherein players advance in time\nfree of any negotiations with other players until interaction between players\nexists, known as a \"lockstep mode.\" This mode may be defined by a certain area\naround a player, such as a sphere, in which the game world may be affected by\nthe player.\n\nSuch an interaction can only occur when, for example, the areas of influence\nsurrounding two players intersect.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n  * 1500 Archers on a 28.8, a comprehensive write-up by Mark Terrano and Paul Bettner, who developed the lock-step protocol for Age of Empires.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Algorithms and Networking for Computer Games, Jouni Smed and Harri Hakonen\n  2. ^ \"Cheat-Proof Playout for Centralized and Distributed Online Games\", Baughman and Levine, 2001\n\nRetrieved from\n\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lockstep_protocol&oldid=1153705983\"\n\nCategories:\n\n  * Cheating in video games\n  * Network protocols\n\nHidden categories:\n\n  * Wikipedia articles needing rewrite from August 2017\n  * All articles needing rewrite\n  * Articles needing additional references from May 2016\n  * All articles needing additional references\n  * Articles with multiple maintenance issues\n\n  * This page was last edited on 7 May 2023, at 21:13 (UTC).\n  * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0; additional terms may apply.
