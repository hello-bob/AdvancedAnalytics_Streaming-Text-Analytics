Last week\nwas a new type of challenging audience: 2nd graders.\n\nI spoke to three different 2nd grade classes at my 7 year old daughter\u2019s\nelementary school. For the event I created a presentation and an AI powered\nwebsite for the kids to create their own stories in a safe manner. The kids\nseemed to have a great time, with one kid even shouting out \u201cI love AI!\u201d\n\nYou can access the full presentation here: 2nd Grade AI Presentation. If you\nhappen to have a similar audience for this topic, this material should\nfunction as a nice starting point.\n\nI had three main goals in mind when mapping out what I wanted to cover:\n\n  * Keep the material short (9 total slides) and engaging (lots of fun pictures and animations)\n\n  * Get the kids working hands on and in pairs by doing several exercises with their classroom Chromebooks\n\n  * Direct students interested in AI to first focus on education and computer fundamentals: reading, writing, math, critical thinking and using computers to create things (but without using AI).\n\nHere are a few highlights from the presentation:\n\nI prompted several AI chatbots (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude Opus) to \u201cdescribe AI to\na 7 year old\u201d as a starting point and then heavily modified the details from\nthere. The image is from the movie Short Circuit, and while it is an old\ncomedy movie the general depiction of a computer consuming large amounts of\ndata to learn is sound.\n\nHighlighting various everyday examples of AI in our lives:\n\n  * Video recommendations on YouTube\n\n  * Audio assistants such as Alexa and Google Home\n\n  * Augmented reality features in popular social apps\n\n  * AI opponents in video and computer games\n\n  * Self driving cars\n\n  * Images: This is the same image I used for the presentation title page background. Created with DALL-E 3.\n\n  * Music: I created this song by prompting Udio with a music genre and school specific lyrics (the school\u2019s name and several teacher\u2019s names).\n\n  * Video: This example video was taken from the Google Lumiere project page\n\nTeachable machine is great because it is free to use with no login required.\nStudents worked in pairs, so having one student pose while the other takes the\npicture and vice versa worked well. Navigating the interface was slightly\ntricky for 7 year olds, so this might be ideally suited for children just a\nfew years older.\n\nAfter trying a few different existing options for kids storytelling\napplications I decided to create this website. You can find the open source\ncode to deploy yourself on my GitHub project:\nhttps://github.com/brettdidonato/Kids-AI-Story-Creator. It uses Google Gemini\nPro for creating the story and DALL-E 3 for generating the story related\nimage.\n\nHere is the input form:\n\nAnd here is example output:\n\n> In the vast expanse of outer space, two unlikely friends embarked on an\n> unforgettable adventure. Ada, a curious 7-year-old guinea pig, and Nina, a\n> playful 7 -year-old dog, found themselves stranded on a distant planet.\n>\n> Ada's tiny paws scurried across the strange rocks, her whiskers twitching\n> with excitement. Nina barked cheerfully, her tail wagging like a propeller.\n> As they explored, they came across a peculiar spaceship shaped like a giant\n> carrot.\n>\n> With a squeak of delight, Ada hopped inside, followed by Nina. Buttons and\n> dials sparkled all around them, inviting them to play. They pushed and\n> pulled levers, sending the spaceship zooming through the stars.\n>\n> Suddenly, the spaceship began to shake violently. Ada and Nina squealed in\n> fear as they were tossed about. They crashed into walls and bumped into each\n> other, their laughter mixing with their panicked cries.\n>\n> Finally, the spaceship came to a stop with a loud thunk. Ada and Nina\n> tumbled out, giggling uncontrollably. They had survived their wild ride\n> through outer space and returned safely to their newfound friendship.\n\nMany other equivalent websites require logging in and are paid. I also found a\nshocking lack of safety controls, with curse words and adult subject matter\nbeing very easy to generate.\n\nThe kids had a great time making stories and were amazed at the pictures. The\npictures are not always representative of the kids themselves, but that is not\neasily solved without asking for gender and demographic information, which is\nsomething I wanted to avoid.\n\nI directed students interested in AI to first focus on education and computer\nfundamentals: reading, writing, math, critical thinking and using computers to\ncreate things (but without using AI). This, along with getting the kids\nexcited about technology in general, is the most important takeaway.\n\n### Subscribe to Brett DiDonato\n\nLaunched a month ago\n\nLet's talk about the present and future of AI\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Teaching AI to 2nd Graders\n\nbrettdidonato.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nOpenAI Sora: Are we all seeing the same thing?\n\nOne of the most hyped AI announcements this year was when OpenAI announced\ntheir proprietary video generation model Sora last month.
