Yet in this\nhigh-noise, high-uncertainty era of quantum computing it seems fair to say\nthat the advantage part is a bit of a stretch. Most recently an anonymous\npaper (PDF, starts at page 199) takes IBM\u2019s claims with its 127-bit Eagle\nquantum processor to its ludicrous conclusion by running the same Trotterized\nIsing model on the ~1 MHz MOS 6510 processor in a Commodore 64. (Worth noting:\nthis paper was submitted to Sigbovik, the conference of the Association for\nComputational Heresy.)\n\nWe previously covered the same claims by IBM already getting walloped by\nanother group of researchers (Tindall et al., 2024) using a tensor network on\na classical computer. The anonymous submitter of the Sigbovik paper based\ntheir experiment on a January 2024 research paper by [Tomislav Begu\u0161i\u0107] and\ncolleagues as published in Science Advances. These researchers also used a\nclassical tensor network to run the IBM experiment many times faster and more\naccurately, which the anonymous researcher(s) took as the basis for a version\nthat runs on the C64 in a mere 15 kB of RAM, with the code put on an Atmel\nAT28C256 ROM inside a cartridge which the C64 then ran from.\n\nThe same sparse Pauli dynamics algorithm was used as by [Tomislav Begu\u0161i\u0107] et\nal., with some limitations due to the limited amount of RAM, implementing it\nin 6502 assembly. Although the C64 is ~300,000x slower per datapoint than a\nmodern laptop, it does this much more efficiently than the quantum processor,\nand without the high error rate. Yes, that means that a compute cluster of\nCommodore 64s can likely outperform a \u2018please call us for a quote\u2019 quantum\nsystem depending on which linear algebra problem you\u2019re trying to solve.\nQuantum computers may yet have their application, but this isn\u2019t it, yet.\n\nThanks to [Stephen Walters] and [Pio] for the tip.\n\nPosted in ScienceTagged commodore 64, Ising model, quantum computing\n\n## 8 thoughts on \u201cTrolling IBM\u2019s Quantum Processor Advantage With A Commodore\n64\u201d\n\n  1. Truth says:\n\nApril 21, 2024 at 12:07 am\n\n\u201cOf course, science is only valuable if it is replicable, so to support any\nreplication studies of this work, source code will be available upon\nreasonable request to the author. In the spirit of SIGBOVIK, you may request\neither a copy handwritten on papyrus, a slideshow of blurry screenshots\nrecorded on a VHS tape, or that I dictate it to you personally over the\nphone.\u201d\n\nI love all three options for access to the source code.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. elwing says:\n\nApril 21, 2024 at 12:22 am\n\ngiven the size, the dictate option is most likely the best option...\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    2. . says:\n\nApril 21, 2024 at 12:28 am\n\nAre these people living under a rock?

They each share a common property,\nperhaps the most common property possible: they don\u2019t exist. For fans it means\nthey can do anything. In the real world it means they don\u2019t exist. That said,\nI do enjoy the rock\u2019n\u2019roll the young people are listening to these days.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  3.

I am reminded of Microsound by Curtis Roads\nwhom speaks of audio and its magnitudes of scale in the temporal domain.\nAlgorithms are similar, ask not whether we should, but ask if it would be\nilluminating or at least interesting to do so.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.
