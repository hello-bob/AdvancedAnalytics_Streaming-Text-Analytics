Even though it\u2019s called High Speed 2,\nthe core purpose of the line is (or was supposed to be) to increase capacity.\nIf we can relieve the congested West Coast Mainline that connects London with\nBirmingham and Manchester, then more people and more freight can travel via\nrail.\n\nPresumably though, at some point it was decided that \u201ccapacity\u201d isn\u2019t a very\nsexy selling point, hence the messaging emphasis on the minutes the line would\nsave when travelling on it.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame really, as capacity is probably more important when running a\ntransport system. Higher capacity means more customers served and a more\nreliable service.\n\nFor example, the Elizabeth Line in London will get you from Paddington to\nLiverpool Street faster than the alternatives, but it would still be useless\nif it only ran once an hour. The real value is that it has 24 trains-per-hour,\neach capable of carrying 1500 people. And that it means you don\u2019t need to\ntravel on the horrible Central Line.\n\nSo from a transport network design perspective, capacity and the throughput of\npassengers matters, and it is definitely something to worry about, because\ncapacity bottlenecks can have network-wide downstream consequences.\n\nTake the below map for instance. On paper, and in the fevered imagination of\nevery spoddy man inside the M25, it seems obvious that Transport for London\n(TfL) should connect up the mainline Clapham Junction Station with the Tube\u2019s\nNorthern Line. As now the Northern terminates at the new Battersea Power\nStation redevelopment, it is painfully close to joining up1 with the UK\u2019s\nbusiest interchange station2.\n\nHowever, the reason it hasn\u2019t been done is because connecting directly with\nClapham would overload the Tube. It would direct thousands more commuters on\nto the Northern Line, and there simply isn\u2019t the capacity to cope with the\nextra influx.\n\nAnd what makes this connection an even more unlikely possibility is that\nuntangling this capacity crunch would itself be a nightmare.\n\nIn theory, there is a way to do it. It\u2019s could be possible to run more trains\non the Northern Line by splitting it in half. Londoners reading will be aware\nit\u2019s a strange line as it contains two almost completely separate branches \u2013\nwith one half running into the City of London, and the other half through the\nWest End, with the lines converging at Camden Town \u2013 before splitting again to\nhead on two different branches into North London.\n\nSo in principle, the almost-completely-separate two branches could be severed\ncompletely into two separate Tube lines, meaning that trains can run on both\nmore frequently \u2013 increasing the line\u2019s capacity.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t easy to do either, because of another capacity issue: If the\nline was fully split, Camden Town station \u2013 where the two branches meet \u2013\nwould be similarly overloaded with passengers interchanging from one branch to\nthe other. So this means that before Clapham Junction and Battersea Power\nStation in South London can be connected, you first need to bulldoze and\nrebuild a major station in North London.\n\nIn other words, its capacity bottlenecks all the way down. And the elephant in\nthe room is obviously money: The reason these are bottlenecks is because\nrebuilding and enlarging stations hugely expensive.\n\nFor example, when Bank was enlarged a few years ago to create more space on\nthe Northern Line platforms for passengers to wait, it cost around \u00a3700m. And\nupgrading Camden is estimated to cost a similar amount.\n\nSo the obvious question to ask is: Is there any way to upgrade station\ncapacity without an expensive rebuild? If we can squeeze more people through\nthe existing stations, that\u2019s better for everyone \u2013 from passengers wanting a\ncomfortable journey to TfL\u2019s Chief Finance Officer not wanting to have an\naneurism.\n\nExcitingly, I\u2019m pleased to say there is \u2013 at least, to an extent.\n\nUsing the Freedom of Information Act, I\u2019ve obtained some internal TfL\ndocuments that reveal how Tube station throughput \u2013 literally the number of\npeople passing through one common station bottleneck \u2013 could be increased,\nmeaning that conceivably more people could be squeezed in across the Tube\nnetwork.\n\nTo be clear, this likely isn\u2019t going to be a world-changing capacity\nimprovement. This isn\u2019t like how adding the Elizabeth Line singlehandedly\nadded 10% to Tube\u2019s capacity. It will not make it possible to connect Clapham\nand Battersea. Nothing will beat bricks and mortar for that. We still need to\nKeep Building Stuff.\n\nBut this is a very cool incremental gain that, if TfL were to roll it out,\ncould squeeze that little bit of extra juice out of the existing Tube network.\n\nSo let\u2019s dig in and find out what it is.\n\nIf you enjoy nerdy stuff like this, then subscribe (for free!) to get my takes\non politics, policy, media, tech, and \u2013 of course \u2013 transport, direct to your\ninbox:\n\n##\n\nThe intelligent gateline\n\nOur story begins at Blackhorse Road Tube Station, at the northern end of the\nVictoria Line in Walthamstow. It\u2019s primarily a commuter station serving a\nresidential area \u2013 and every day the passenger flow is what you\u2019d expect. In\nthe morning, most people are heading into the station, en route to work. And\nin the evening, it\u2019s the reverse.\n\nOn their way in passengers will, of course, have to pass through one of the\nseven ticket barriers - or the \u201cgateline\u201d, to use TfL jargon.\n\nTypically gatelines are a major chokepoint in a station, as everyone has to\npass through a gate one at a time, tapping their Oyster card or phone on the\nway.\n\nRemember these seven gates as they will become important in a minute.\n\nTo get as many people through the gates as possible, they are designed to be\nconfigurable. Station staff can choose which are open and in which direction.\nThis means that, for example, you can have more entry barriers in the morning,\nand more exit barriers in the evening to match demand.\n\nHowever, changing the direction of barriers is not something that typically\nhappens very often. Staff might switch them over at a set time of day. Or if\nthey notice a build up of people queuing, perhaps they\u2019ll switch a gate over\nmanually. But as things stand, judging by the documents I\u2019ve obtained, it is\nnot a particularly dynamic process.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve all been there, silently swearing at the tourist ahead of us, as\nthey fumble with their phones and stop dead right at the barrier.\n\nSo you can probably guess where this is going: What if the gateline was more\nresponsive to real time conditions in the station? What if it could\nautomatically swap the direction of gates based on where the crowds are coming\nfrom? If the gates could flip at the right times, that means increased station\nthroughput \u2013 and thus more capacity for passengers inside the station and\nacross the network. How much more efficient could that make the Tube?\n\nThis was what TfL set out to find out, enlisting transport tech company Cubic\nand the University of Portsmouth to help.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t subscribed yet and have read this far into an article about the\nefficiency of ticket gates then what on earth are you doing? You\u2019re clearly\npart of my core demographic.\n\n##\n\nHow it works\n\nTo make it all work, TfL first needed to figure out which direction passengers\nwere coming from. To do this, it used cameras3 made by a company called Xovis\nthat are designed to track and count people, figure out the direction they are\ntravelling, and how long it takes to queue4.\n\nHere\u2019s what one of the cameras saw:\n\nAnd here\u2019s a representation of how the cameras turn images into data: You can\nsee where all of the individuals in the ticket hall are (the blobs), and the\npaths they have taken to get there (the lines trailing). The yellow boxes are\nwhere queues may build up.\n\nMost boring Metal Gear Solid VR mission ever.\n\nNext it was then simply a case of... letting the AI take control of the gates.\nBut here, TfL took an ultra-cautious approach.\n\nFor example, as far as I can tell from the docs, the two extra-wide gates at\neither side were kept on manual mode for the duration. It was only one gate \u2013\nnumber 42 on the diagram above \u2013 that was ever operated in fully autonomous\nmode, switching automatically based on what the sensors were saying.\n\nThe other four (40, 41, 43 and 44) were operated in \u201csupervisor mode\u201d. This\nwas where the Cubic system would decide when directional changes were needed,\nbut instead of just flipping the gates over, it would first send a request to\na tablet held by a member of staff \u2013 who could then accept or decline the\nchange.\n\nAction shot of a member of staff using a tablet to change direction.\n\nSo in essence, the actual hardware deployment was relatively simple. Though\nbehind the scenes there was a lot of hidden complexity.\n\nFor example, TfL and Cubic enlisted the help of the University of Portsmouth\nto figure out the optimal mathematical model for triggering changes to the\ngateline. Here\u2019s some complex-looking probability calculations5 that gave me\nanxiety flashbacks to A-level maths:\n\nThe model was also apparently designed to be agnostic on the type of sensors\nused too \u2013 it\u2019s conceivable the same monitoring could be achieved by, for\nexample, sniffing out bluetooth signals from passengers\u2019 phones instead of\nusing AI cameras, or by plugging into existing CCTV (a bit like the later TfL\nSmart Station trial). But these other techniques were not tested6.\n\nAnd one other interesting technical tidbit is that the sensors were also set\nup to have a safety break: The cameras also kept watch of the top of the\nescalators (that\u2019s the big yellow box on the diagram above), and it would\nalert the staff to close all of the gates if it was getting particularly busy,\nto help manage the crowds.\n\nThis is clever as it shows two things: First, the potential safety benefits\nfrom a system like this, but also why improving throughput is important:\nBecause apparently in just the two weeks the hardware was tested at Blackhorse\nRoad, apparently there were eleven \u201cescalations\u201d with the safety alert,\nsuggesting stations can become dangerously busy with relative ease.\n\n##\n\nLooking at the numbers\n\nGiven how it was designed, with most of the gates merely in supervised mode,\nit was a relatively timid trial. If I were in charge, I\u2019d have recklessly set\nall of the gates to automatic \u2013 but I guess TfL is more responsible than I am.\n\nBut even given these limitations, the results are striking. To work out the\nreal impact this tech could have, TfL fed the real world data into a lab-based\nsimulation model, which assumed all of the gates were controlled\nautomatically. And it reveals that the impact could be significant.\n\nFor example, the study found that this AI could reduce queuing times by\nsomething like 75.6% or even 89.63%, depending on which mathematical queuing\nmodel was used (hence the complex maths above).\n\nAnd for residential stations like Blackhorse Road, the study concluded that it\ncould increase passenger throughput at the gateline by around 30%7. That seems\npretty dramatic to me! Think of all of the extra passenger capacity that could\nbe squeezed out of the existing Tube system \u2013 especially during peak times.\n\n##\n\nBarriers to adoption\n\nGiven the apparent advantages of using AI like this, you might think that the\nnext obvious step would be to role out the technology across the Tube network.\n\nFor a relatively small, fixed-cost investment in each station, TfL could scale\nthis efficiency gain across the five million passengers journeys a day on the\nTube network, which adds up to a network with more capacity, fewer\nbottlenecks, and fewer annoyances during rush hour.\n\nAnd what might surprise you is that TfL has had plenty of time to do this: The\ntrial took place between 2017 and 2019. That\u2019s ages ago now \u2013 for context,\nback when the project began, Peter Capaldi was still Doctor Who, Elizabeth\nHolmes and Sam Bankman-Fried were still inspiring business leaders, and I\nstill had a full head of hair.\n\nHowever, since testing at Blackhorse Road, nothing has happened. According\nTfL\u2019s response to my request, \u201csince the completion of the trial in 2019 we\nhave not progressed the project further.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately I\u2019ve no further information on why TfL has left this compelling\nstudy just sitting there, but if I had to speculate, I\u2019d bet that it\u2019s a\ncombination of the extreme financial pressure that TfL is currently under, and\nthe fact that just a few months after the trial concluded, whoever was\nchampioning it at TfL presumably had bigger, pandemic-related things to worry\nabout8.\n\nIn any case, this seems like a missed opportunity not to do something further\nwith it9.\n\nIn the longer term it seems likely to me that even if passenger numbers\nhaven\u2019t quite recovered from the pandemic yet, there is a structural\ninevitability that at some point in the future, capacity could become an even\nbigger issue for London\u2019s transport network.\n\nWhy? Because pick any Tube station at random and chances are you\u2019ll see some\npretty dense residential development in the immediate vicinity10. For all of\nthe NIMBY problems, London is still steadily building new homes near Tube\nstations, and this means more people to squeeze into the existing Tube system.\n\nSo it\u2019s inevitable that capacity will continue to be an issue. And while we\ncontinue to dream of the day we can one day take the Northern Line to Clapham\nJunction, this at least seems like a pretty neat way of making more of what\nwe\u2019ve already got.\n\nPhew!

Go read it!\n\n1\n\nThis is completely irrelevant and tangential but another really satisfying bit\nof Tube-map-joining-up would be to extend the DLR west from Bank. Imagine if\nit were to go all the way to the old Jubilee Line platforms at Charing Cross\n(where the Jubilee terminated before it was extended south of the river in\n1999). You could even have extra stops at the old abandoned Strand/Aldwych\nstation, and City Thameslink, finally putting that latter station on the Tube\nmap. Sadly, however, even if money were no object it wouldn\u2019t make much sense,\nas it would just mean that by the time trains got to Bank they were already be\noverloaded \u2013 defeating the point of a railway designed to take people from the\nCity to the Docklands.\n\n2\n\nI understand from talking to men in anoraks that the developers of Battersea\nPower Station have even constructed the new station in such a way that it\nwould make one day building the extension more viable.\n\n3\n\nIn my experience covering these things, the companies that make these sorts of\ndevices are very, er, sensitive, about their tech being referred to as a\n\u201ccamera\u201d for obvious \u201cinviting people to complain about privacy\u201d reasons. So\nI\u2019m sure the company and others like them would rather I call it a \u201csensor\u201d \u2013\nand to be fair, there are some differences: Though there is an optical sensor\n(like a camera), images are processed on device, and though I\u2019m not sure\nexactly which model of sensor used in this trial, it appears that Xovis\ndevices are configurable to not share images, and only spit out data.\n\n4\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the capability existed in the cameras used in the TfL trial \u2013\nthis was a few years ago \u2013 but the cameras the company currently sells are\napparently capable of tracking which way customers are looking. In other\nwords, as you look around the supermarket shelves, this technology can figure\nout what products are catching your eye. Crazy.\n\n5\n\nWell done inevitable smug man in the comments who intuitively understands\nthis, have a pat on the head.\n\n6\n\nWhen the trial was first designed, there was a plan to test some of these\nother technologies at Marylebone station \u2013 though this was apparently\nabandoned because of the complexity of installing the necessary kit in a\nlisted building.\n\n7\n\nApply this model to other types of station, such as big mainline terminals or\nstations in business areas may be different \u2013 or was at least out of scope of\nthis model.\n\n8\n\nAnd I\u2019d bet that it hasn\u2019t been picked up again not just because of the\naforementioned financial pressure, but also because it isn\u2019t clear yet how\nlong term Tube usage/commuting patterns will have changed. Tube usage is still\nonly at around 75-80% of what it was pre-pandemic, so perhaps throughput\nsimply isn\u2019t as pressing an issue.\n\n9\n\nIt is possible to imagine how there could be even more efficiencies lurking in\nthe data too if they continued to build on it. For example, imagine if the\ngateline was plugged into real time transit data. When a bus parks up outside\nor when a train pulls into a platform, the gateline could quietly configure a\nfew extra gates to prepare for the brief glut of foot-traffic that will be\nquickly approaching.\n\n10\n\nFor example, take a look at Tottenham Hale and Bromley-by-Bow, which are both\nresidential stations that are seeming nearby former industrial land turned\ninto flats. Over the last few years Finsbury Park has transformed too, with a\nmajor residential development almost directly on top of the station. And\nElephant and Castle is the same.\n\n### Subscribe to Odds and Ends of History\n\nBy James O'Malley \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nWhy that thing you retweeted is probably wrong.\n\n21 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n21\n\nShare this post\n\n#### This TfL AI experiment reveals how Tube station capacity could be\nincreased \u2013 without building anything new\n\ntakes.jamesomalley.co.uk\n\n13\n\nShare\n\n13 Comments\n\nGordon BarrMay 1Liked by James O'MalleyVery interesting thanks - I'm curious\nif how often gates are direction switched is a factor too - if they switch\nthem back and forward too often that could decrease the efficiency - it's also\nvery annoying if the gate you're waiting to go through suddenly turns from\ngreen to red and you have to move across to another one, screwing up the\nqueueing algorithms!Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by James O'Malley\n\nRichard GadsdenRichard\u2019s SubstackMay 1Liked by James O'MalleyJust to really\nemphasize how important capacity and frequency are:I got the bus to the\nhospital today (routine blood tests). There's a direct bus (the 53), that runs\nfrom outside my front door to literally outside the hospital, and it only\ntakes 10 minutes. Or I can get any of an 86/253/256 and change onto a\n41/42/43/141/142/143; this takes about 15 minutes as I have to cross the road\nbetween bus stops when changing bus.The 53 runs every half-hour, so I\ngenerally just change buses, as the combined service on both routes is more\nfrequent than every 5 minutes. A single return journey is \u00a34, a day pass is\n\u00a35, so it's only a quid extra and I can get any bus I like.Expand full\ncommentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n11 more comments...\n\nNo, Captain Tom wasn\u2019t raising money for the NHS\n\nIt was for NHS Charities, and the difference matters.\n\nFeb 4, 2021 \u2022\n\nJames O'Malley\n\n9\n\nShare this post\n\n#### No, Captain Tom wasn\u2019t raising money for the NHS\n\ntakes.jamesomalley.co.uk\n\n18\n\nTfL's AI Tube Station experiment is amazing and slightly terrifying\n\nMind the Orwellian Surveillance Apparatus\n\nFeb 12 \u2022\n\nJames O'Malley\n\n40\n\nShare this post\n\n#### TfL's AI Tube Station experiment is amazing and slightly terrifying\n\ntakes.jamesomalley.co.uk\n\n16\n\n\"Woke\" is a new ideology and its proponents should admit it\n\nWhen a new thing is created it needs a name\n\nDec 14, 2022 \u2022\n\nJames O'Malley\n\n48\n\nShare this post\n\n#### \"Woke\" is a new ideology and its proponents should admit it\n\ntakes.jamesomalley.co.uk\n\n32\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 James O'Malley\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
