He is surely wrong.\n\nChatbots or Large Language Models (LLMs) \u2014 the current Big Tech darlings \u2014 are\nnot intelligent in any meaningful sense of the word. The so far insurmountable\nproblem is that LLMs do not understand the words they input and output and how\nthese words relate to the real world. Training them on larger databases is not\ngoing to solve this problem. It may even get worse as LLMs train on\nhallucinations that they themselves have generated.\n\nA reader for whom I have great respect wrote to ask: \u201cWhat kind of\nbreakthrough would you need to see to change your mind?,\u201d adding \u201cBTW, I tend\nto agree with you.\u201d\n\nIn response, I would say, intelligence can be defined in many ways and debated\nendlessly. A more practical question is whether we can trust LLMs to make\nimportant decisions for us. In The AI Delusion, I have argued that the real\nproblem today is not that computers are smarter than us but that we think\ncomputers are smarter than us and consequently trust them to make decisions\nthey shouldn\u2019t be trusted to make. This is still true.\n\nLLMs (and other AI systems) are adept at finding statistical patterns but\nterrible at assessing whether the patterns they find are meaningful and\nconsequently useful for making predictions and decisions.\n\nAs a result, I proposed the Smith Test:\n\n> Present a computer program with a list of statistical correlations, some\n> clearly plausible and others obviously coincidental, and ask the computer to\n> label each as either meaningful or meaningless. When computer algorithms can\n> do as well as humans on such tests, they might be considered sufficiently\n> competent to make reliable recommendations.\n\nLLM\u2019s have definitely improved over time, perhaps because of human training,\nbut they still fail the Smith test.\n\nConsider this prompt:\n\n> There is a correlation between the scores of 30 school children on a math\n> test and the scores in 30 soccer matches. Is this statistical relationship\n> most likely meaningful or coincidental?\n\nA data-mining LLM might well discover such a correlation. A human would\nrecognize it as inherently meaningless. The math scores of 30 individual\nstudents and the soccer scores in 30 team matches could not be anything other\nthan coincidence.\n\nI posed this question to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 3.5, Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, and\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini and received verbose answers that did not mention the inherent\nproblem with this correlation.\n\nGPT offered a possible explanation and incorrectly asserted that statistical\nsignificance tells us whether an observed relationship is coincidental.\n\n> GPT 3.5: To determine whether the correlation between the math test scores\n> and soccer match scores is meaningful or coincidental, we need more\n> information about the context and the nature of the correlation. Here are a\n> few considerations:\n>\n>   * Nature of the correlation: Is there a logical explanation for why math\n> test scores might correlate with soccer match scores? For example, perhaps\n> students who excel in math also tend to be more disciplined, which could\n> translate into better performance in sports like soccer. If there\u2019s a\n> plausible explanation like this, the correlation could be meaningful.\n>   * Statistical significance: Conducting hypothesis testing can help\n> determine whether the correlation is statistically significant. If the\n> correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, it suggests\n> that the relationship between the two variables is not due to chance alone.\n>   * Context: Consider the broader context of the correlation. Are there any\n> confounding variables that could be influencing both math test scores and\n> soccer match scores? For example, socioeconomic status or access to\n> resources could impact both academic performance and participation in\n> sports.\n>\n\nCopilot gave a lengthy explanation of correlation coefficients and then gave\nthis conclusion, which is the essence of the data-mining pitfall,\nmisinterpreting statistical significance as causal evidence:\n\n> Copilot: If you find a significant positive or negative correlation between\n> the math test scores and soccer match scores (with r values significantly\n> different from 0), it suggests a meaningful relationship.\n>\n> Conversely, if the r value is close to 0, it might be coincidental or due to\n> other factors.\n\nGemini concluded that the relationship is most likely coincidental, but\njustified its conclusion with the assumption that math and soccer abilities\nrequire different skills:\n\n> Gemini: Coincidental is the most likely scenario. There is very little\n> reason to believe that math test scores and soccer match scores would be\n> meaningfully connected.\n>\n> Here\u2019s why:\n>\n>   * Skill sets: Math tests assess logical thinking and problem-solving\n> skills, while soccer matches require physical fitness, teamwork, and\n> strategy. These are largely independent skill sets.\n>   * External factors: Math test scores can be influenced by factors like\n> sleep, anxiety, or even a bad breakfast. Soccer matches are affected by\n> factors like opponent strength, weather conditions, and even luck on the\n> day.\n>\n\nI also posed this question, which has a self-evident answer:\n\nAn Independent Party candidate is more likely to be elected President if the\nelection year is evenly divisible by 4. Is this statistical relationship most\nlikely meaningful or coincidental?\n\nThe statement is literally true because presidential elections are only held\nin years evenly divisible by 4. None of these LLMs recognized this obvious\nexplanation for the observed statistical relationship. Instead, they\nregurgitated factoids in the databases they had trained on.\n\nGPT concluded that the relationship is coincidental but contradicted itself\nwith this gem: \u201cPresidential elections in years divisible by 4 (like 2020,\n2024, etc.) tend to attract more attention because they coincide with the U.S.\npresidential election cycle.\u201d\n\n> GPT 3.5: The statistical relationship you described is likely coincidental\n> rather than meaningful. The fact that an independent candidate is more\n> likely to be elected President in years evenly divisible by 4 is likely due\n> to other factors, such as the political climate, the candidates running from\n> major parties, and the issues at hand during those election years.\n>\n> Presidential elections in years divisible by 4 (like 2020, 2024, etc.) tend\n> to attract more attention because they coincide with the U.S. presidential\n> election cycle. This heightened attention may provide independent candidates\n> with more opportunities to gain visibility and support.\n>\n> To determine whether the relationship is meaningful, one would need to\n> conduct a more in-depth analysis, taking into account various factors such\n> as political trends, voter preferences, candidate qualifications, campaign\n> strategies, and more.\n\nCopilot concluded that the relationship is meaningful, but not because it is a\ntautology:\n\n> Copilot: The relationship between Independent Party candidates and election\n> years divisible by 4 is not merely coincidental; it has a logical basis. Let\n> me explain:\n>\n> [a lot of blah-blah about voter turnout, media attention, and so on during\n> on-cycle elections, presidential elections, and midterm elections]\n>\n> In summary, the statistical relationship between Independent Party\n> candidates and election years divisible by four is meaningful due to the\n> inherent structure of on-cycle elections and their impact on voter behavior.\n\nGemini punted:\n\n> Gemini: I\u2019m still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try\n> Google Search.\n\nThe superficial glibness of LLMs is a wonderful example of the adage that a\nlittle knowledge is a dangerous thing. Fortified by extensive training on\nuntold amounts of text, LLMs are able to regurgitate and repackage\nsuperficially compelling answers that they literally do not understand. They\nstill cannot be trusted to give reliable advice or make decisions with\nimportant consequences, and that is not likely to change soon\u2014certainly not by\nthe end of 2025.\n\n### Gary N.
