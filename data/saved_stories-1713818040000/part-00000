Traba runs one of the startup world\u2019s most unique, unapologetic cultures. The $200 million staffing platform modeled its standards on China\u2019s \u201c9-9-6\u201d schedule, which expects employees to work from 9 AM to 9 PM, six days a week. While it has relaxed its policies as it has grown, Traba still counts an \u201cOlympian work ethic\u201d as a key cultural value.\n\n  * Attacking a broken market. If you were designing a market ripe for disruption, it would look quite like global staffing. It is valued at around $600 billion, highly fragmented, and slow to adopt technology. CEO Mike Shebat recognized the opportunity in the space while working at McMaster-Carr and saw the poor reliability existing staffing companies provided. Traba is attacking the opportunity, bringing a tech-first approach to the light industrial staffing segment.\n\n  * A pragmatic product. CTO Akshay Buddiga\u2019s team has built a functional, intelligent platform serving businesses in need of workers and the workers themselves. Traba\u2019s technology seems to offer a step-change improvement over incumbents, providing greater visibility, control, and reliability. It also benefits workers, who can discover jobs and get paid much faster.\n\n  * Hitting fast forward. Traba\u2019s solution has found a ready market. In a little over three years, it has approached $7 million in annualized revenue, growing 465% year-over-year. Impressively, it has managed to increase its contribution margins while doing so, hitting 66.2% at the end of last year. There\u2019s a reason why elite investors like Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures have capitalized the startup.\n\n  * Trillion-dollar dreams. Mike Shebat does not want to build a billion-dollar startup. He says, almost as a statement of fact, that Traba will become a trillion-dollar company, joining the ranks of players like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Nvidia. It is an audacious claim with slim odds, but one that says much about the company\u2019s ambition.\n\n###\n\nBrought to you by Airwallex\n\nAirwallex was built with a single purpose in mind \u2013 to create a world where\nall businesses can operate without borders and restrictions, and by doing so,\npropel the growth of the global digital economy.\n\nWith our proprietary infrastructure, we take the friction out of global\npayments and financial operations, empowering businesses of all sizes to\nunlock new opportunities and grow beyond borders.\n\nOver 100,000 businesses globally including brands such as Brex, Rippling,\nNavan, Qantas, SHEIN, and many more use our software and APIs to manage\neverything from global payments, treasury, and spend management to embedded\nfinance.\n\nFor more information on how Airwallex can help you simplify your global\npayments and financial operations, get in touch with our team today.

I told this friend, the founder of a\nsuccessful New York based company, what was keeping us from steak frites, bone\nmarrow, and perhaps a vodka martini.\n\n\u201cI am writing this case study on a company called Traba that implements a\nChinese-style 996 schedule,\u201d I texted, explaining that I was slated for a\nlate-night office visit at the same time as our dinner.\n\nHe responded quickly: \u201cThere\u2019s no way this is possible in NYC.\u201d\n\nThat disbelief was the very reason I\u2019d been keen to study Traba, after hearing\nCEO Mike Shebat on a podcast. Speaking to 20VC\u2019s Harry Stebbings, Shebat had\nproudly championed his startup\u2019s long hours, \u201cOlympian\u201d work ethic, and\nmission to build a $1 trillion business. Despite having no previous interest\nin Traba\u2019s market of light industrial staffing nor familiarity with Shebat\u2019s\ncareer, I found myself intrigued by his rhetoric. He was saying something\nprofoundly obvious in one respect \u2013 that building an extraordinary company\ntakes extraordinary work \u2013 but also transgressive. There are few more\nefficient routes to an internet argument than to eulogize the 80-hour week.\n\nIn 1997, McKinsey published \u201cThe War for Talent,\u201d an assessment of the\nincreasing competition for skilled workers. In the 27 years since its release,\nthe contest has intensified, with the fiercest fighting taking place among\ntech\u2019s ping-pong tables and cereal bars. We may call it a war, but it is a\ncombat defined not by hardship and deprivation but inducements and abundance.\nThe Apple engineer biking along velvet lawns, the Google PM puttering away in\ntheir \u201c20% time,\u201d the Meta designer enjoying a bowl of lightly candied ginger\n\u2013 these are the images piped to us from tech\u2019s frontline. Though perhaps\nexaggerated, they reflect the consensus strategy of the past decade: to win\nthe best talent, you must offer the most luxurious perks and best \u201cwork-life\nbalance.\u201d Demand too much and you risk losing the cerebration and sweat of the\nemployee you worked so hard to convert.\n\nTraba is taking a different approach. While peers and forebearers emulate the\ndecadence of a banal, patronizing Rome, Shebat is aiming for something closer\nto Sparta. Intensity, effort, sweat \u2013 these are not the unsavory byproducts of\nbuilding a company; they are the end, in and of themselves. \u201cThe purpose of\nlife is to be defeated by greater and greater things,\u201d the poet Ranier Marie\nRilke wrote. Above all, this seems to be Traba\u2019s pitch: tech\u2019s best talent\nwants a mountain to climb, not a nap pod.\n\nIt has invited its fair share of criticism. Any time Traba\u2019s culture is\nmentioned on social media, a catalog of outraged commentary follows. The more\nhysterical suggest that Traba\u2019s expectations are \u201cbordering slavery\u201d \u2013 a great\naffront to those actually forced to work against their volition rather than by\nchoice in a decent if unflashy Broadway office. Others insist Shebat\u2019s\nmethodology must lead to unhappy employees, high turnover, and burnout, as if\nit were a law of the natural world.\n\nAs someone who spent a miserable, braindead year working 60-plus hour weeks at\na law firm (a light jog by investment banking standards), I, too, felt some\nskepticism. Could a startup promising punishing hours attract and retain great\ntalent? Could they convince employees to sit at a desk 12 hours a day\nsurrounded by the world\u2019s most hyperactive city? How much of Shebat\u2019s patter\nwas a marketing ruse, a sort of machismo, the commercial equivalent of a\ncollege classmate that brags about the number of all-nighters they pulled\nduring finals week?\n\nBeneath any apprehension, however, was another sensation: excitement. Even\namong the startup world\u2019s many bold CEOs, Shebat stood out for his brazenness\nand audacity. As much as his declamations might have been the signs of a\nskilled showman, they could have just as easily portended a founder with the\nuncommon ambition and grit needed to build something truly special. I had to\nfind out which of those stories were true.\n\nOn a bank holiday Monday in February at 7:00 PM, I stepped off an elevator and\ninto Traba\u2019s office.\n\n##\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that was humanly possible.\u201d\n\nOver the past quarter of a century, few have had as successful an operating\nand investing career as Keith Rabois. Since starting at PayPal as an Executive\nVice President at the turn of the millennium, the Khosla Ventures partner has\nfounded, managed, and invested in a slew of billion-dollar businesses,\nincluding LinkedIn, Square, Faire, Opendoor, OpenStore, Affirm, Ramp, and\nDoorDash. It is a track record that marks Rabois as one of the most gifted\npickers of his generation.\n\nAs a result, when Rabois says that Mike Shebat might be the most persistent\nperson he\u2019s ever met, my ears prick up. This is a man who has counted Elon\nMusk and Vinod Khosla as co-workers. He has invested in Patrick and John\nCollison, Max Levchin, and Tony Xu. None are renowned for their wilting\npersonalities or Wonderbread spines.\n\nWhy? I ask Rabois. What is it about Mike?\n\nMike Shebat was born in Northern Virginia, straight into a competition. \u201cI\nhave a twin brother, Chris. He was six minutes older, so he\u2019s the eldest son\nand I\u2019m the second eldest,\u201d Shebat said. Though just a few hundred seconds\nseparated him from his brother, Mike spent much of his childhood feeling like\nhe trailed by a much greater distance. \u201cMy brother was very good at any sport\nhe did, he got into the Gifted & Talented program in elementary before I did.\nMy parents put us into basketball, soccer, baseball, football \u2013 all the sports\n\u2013 and he always outshone me. As a young child, I developed a chip on my\nshoulder.\u201d\n\nTalking to Shebat in the present day, such stories seem incongruous with his\nimposing, broad-shouldered presence. Though he is quick to smile and easy to\nspeak with, he has an aura of inherent competence that makes him seem like a\ncharacter lifted from an Ayn Rand book \u2013 Hank Rearden with an Equinox\nmembership. It is impossible to imagine him struggling, especially\nathletically.\n\nThe one place Mike stepped out of his brother\u2019s shadow was the swimming pool.\nHis success owed at least as much to his desire to surpass Chris as natural\naptitude. \u201cMy dad brought me to the YMCA one time and he was like, \u2018Oh, you\ncould actually be a good swimmer.\u2019 So I basically went all in on swimming. I\nwas waking up at 4 AM before school, swimming constantly. I became a really\ngood swimmer and broke records on my summer league team.\u201d\n\nEven that narrow spotlight, earned with endless laps, didn\u2019t last. Though Mike\neclipsed his marginally older brother in the pool, his younger brother soon\nsurpassed him. \u201cI was well regarded as a pretty great swimmer. But then my\nlittle brother became an amazing swimmer.\u201d John Shebat would go on to become\nan NCAA champion at the University of Texas and compete at the Olympic Trials.\n\nThough Mike Shebat\u2019s brothers provided direct competition, his parents\nprovided the need to compete in the first place. \u201c[Mike\u2019s drive] does derive\nfrom his family, primarily through his mother,\u201d Rabois said. \u201cShe set the\nfoundation very strongly when he was young that there\u2019s a right and wrong way\nto do things. There\u2019s a Shebat family way to do things.\u201d If a young Mike\nforgot to make his bed in the morning, his mother wouldn\u2019t let it sit until he\ngot home. \u201cI have memories of my mom literally coming into school and taking\nme out of class to go make it,\u201d Mike told me.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Shebat\u2019s father was a soft touch. Mike described him as\ndelivering a \u201chard edge\u201d and demanding \u201cvery high standards.\u201d Afternoons were\nfilled with one hour of piano practice, one hour of reading, and zero hours of\nscreen time. From an early age, the Shebat children were expected to take care\nof their laundry and help clean. \u201cI was raised with no excuses,\u201d Shebat says.\n\u201cIt was a very disciplined environment.\u201d\n\nUpstaged by his siblings athletically, Mike directed his competitive energy\ntoward school. While that helped him stand out in high school, receiving\nadmission to the University of Virginia, he hit his stride during his years in\nCharlottesville. After recreating the rigid schedule of his childhood, Shebat\nfound scholastic success naturally followed. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, I can get\nstraight As if I just put in the inputs and focus.\u2019\u201d For Shebat, it validated\na broader philosophy: \u201cInputs drive outputs. You don\u2019t just get outputs in a\nmiraculous way. You have to do things consistently, not give up, and\neventually, you can outwork the competition.\u201d\n\nIf industry was the central premise of Shebat\u2019s outlook, it was swiftly\nfollowed by uncompromising ambition. When it came to his professional goals,\nShebat showed an unwillingness to take no for an answer and a talent for\nfinding alternate routes to his desired destination. As a junior at UVA\u2019s Arts\nand Sciences school, he was dismayed to discover that his dream employer,\nGoldman Sachs, didn\u2019t recruit for its investment banking practice at his\nschool. Rather than look at other companies, Shebat learned of a Goldman trip\nto hire from the university\u2019s Commerce School, finagling himself an interview.\n\nGetting in the room was the easy part; the real challenge would be out-\ncompeting the many business undergraduates who had spent weeks preparing. \u201cI\ncould just tell by the lay of the land that I had to find a way to get\nnoticed,\u201d Shebat recalled. \u201cI also know that in highly competitive\nenvironments \u2013 like getting an internship or building a startup \u2013 you have to\nbe different than the middle of the Bell Curve to stand out. When you leave an\ninterview, [recruiters] can probably say three sentences about you, and if\nthey\u2019re very similar, you\u2019re just going to blend in.\u201d\n\nYears later, that lesson would stand him in good stead.\n\nTo separate himself from the pack, Shebat put his economics major to good use,\ndiscussing the differences between the discipline\u2019s Austrian and Keynesian\nphilosophies. He sealed his pitch by emphasizing that if Goldman bet on him,\nthey wouldn\u2019t regret it. \u201cBefore I left the room, I was like, \u2018Look, if I were\nto leave you with something, it\u2019s that I promise you I will deliver. I\u2019ve\ndelivered in anything that I do. I will do whatever it takes to succeed\nhere.\u2019\u201d Shebat spent his summer on Wall Street.\n\nIn the end, Shebat didn\u2019t last long in high finance. He joined Blackstone\nafter graduation but quickly yearned for a more hands-on career. \u201cI was like,\n\u2018Ok, in order to develop as a high-potential leader, I need to learn how to\nmanage people, I need to learn how to motivate and inspire people.\u2019 I wanted\nan environment that was heavily operational, where I could learn all the\ndifferent parts of the company. That\u2019s when McMaster-Carr reached out.\u201d\n\nMcMaster-Carr is one of the quiet giants of American industry. Though\nunheralded in tech, the 123-year-old private firm sells 700,000 products, from\npens and paper to air-powered nail guns and welding torches. As much as\nMcMaster boasts an impressive breadth of supply, its depth is even more\nremarkable. It does not simply sell screws; it sells 78,576 \u201cFastening and\nJoining\u201d items, searchable by thread size, length, material, finish, head\ntype, hardness, tensile strength, and about a dozen other dimensions.\n\nShebat\u2019s stint at McMaster gave him a taste of what it meant to be a builder,\nalbeit at a larger, less nimble incumbent. More importantly, it introduced him\nto the light industrial staffing market. When an enterprise customer placed a\nlarge order with McMaster, the supplier spun up temporary teams to manage the\nfulfillment process from packing and labeling to lifting and loading. Rather\nthan try to find short-term workers themselves, McMaster relied on staffing\nagencies.\n\nIn theory, these companies should quickly and reliably source laborers and\nplace them at companies that need them. In practice, Shebat discovered a\ndifferent story. These businesses were neither fast nor reliable. It was\nroutine for agencies to take seven days to hire a team, making it difficult\nfor clients like McMaster to respond to customer demand swiftly. When agencies\nfinally managed to assemble a team, it was usually heavily understaffed, with\nan industry-wide \u201cfill rate\u201d of just 46%. Meaning that if McMaster was looking\nfor a hundred workers, the data suggested they would receive just 46 of them\nfor the job.\n\nIn the years to come, Shebat would learn that industrial staffing\u2019s\ndeficiencies ran down to the bedrock. \u201cThere\u2019s no system of record,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to invite back workers, there\u2019s no way to vet the workers'\nskills. Can they stack fifty-pound boxes? Or are they more attentive to detail\nand want to do more labeling and things like that.\u201d The market was broken, but\nMcMaster-Carr wasn\u2019t the company to fix it.\n\nBy 2016, Shebat was ready for a new challenge. Ever since taking an\nundergraduate class at UVA that encouraged students to build \u201ca fake company,\u201d\nhe knew he wanted to start a firm of his own. But for the first time in a\nwhile, he wasn\u2019t sure of the best next step. Should he go to business school\nand expand his network? Or try his hand at a faster growth startup?\n\nThough unsure of his desire to get an MBA, Shebat threw himself into the\nprocess with trademark intensity. When I asked Keith Rabois why the Traba CEO\nwas the most persistent person he\u2019d ever met, this was the anecdote he pointed\nto first. \u201cHe took the GMAT seven times,\u201d Rabois said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know\nthat was humanly possible,\u201d chuckling as he shared the anecdote.\n\nAs it turns out, Rabois was wrong. Mike Shebat didn\u2019t take the GMAT seven\ntimes, searching for his best possible score. He took it eight. According to\nShebat and several test prep websites, that is the lifetime limit. \u201cI got a\nbetter score every time!!\u201d Shebat said via text. \u201cWent up over 250 points from\nstart to finish. Leave everything on the field and pull every single lever\npossible to succeed. That way no regrets.\u201d As Rabois said of Shebat\u2019s GMAT\nprep, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much how he approaches everything. Once you see that\ncharacteristic, you start seeing it everywhere.\u201d\n\nIf you were a hyper-intense Blackstone alum with a minor in ambition, there\nwere few better places to go in 2016 than Uber. If you had to choose a year as\nUber\u2019s pinnacle, this was it. This was the Uber of Travis Kalanick and toe-\nstepping; the Uber that courted Saudi Arabia and left with $3.5 billion; the\nUber slated to win food delivery and autonomous driving; the Uber before\n#DeleteUber, the Holder investigation, and Dara Khosrowshahi. It was, simply\nput, the Uberiest version of Uber. For a brief moment, it seemed the best way\nto traverse the globe was by black car.\n\nWhen a recruiter reached out to Shebat, he quickly jumped aboard, joining the\ninsurgent Uber Eats division. Over the next five and a half years, Shebat\nwitnessed the company\u2019s hard-charging culture, operational excellence, and\nmanagement of extreme turbulence. He delivered iPads in the Texas heat to try\nand onboard restaurants to the Eats program, moved to Mexico and Brazil to\nlaunch international markets, and learned to set his sights ever higher. \u201c[I\nremember when I met] Travis Kalanick, I asked, \u2018What kind of books are you\nreading?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, I\u2019m reading about Rockefeller.\u2019 I was like, \u2018That\u2019s\nso inspiring, he\u2019s dreaming big.\u2019\u201d\n\nShebat worked relentlessly. \u201cI love what I do, I don\u2019t really see it as work.\nEven when I was at Uber, I worked all the time. Because I enjoy it, I enjoy\ntrying to get better.\u201d Shebat\u2019s enjoyment extended to the most stressful\naspects of the job. \u201cWhat better way to learn than to be thrown in and have to\nsolve problems every day. Kind of like a math professor \u2013 a math professor\nwithout any problems to solve is not a very happy math professor.\u201d\n\nA variable compensation package spurred his drive. \u201cFrom Travis, another thing\nI learned is I remember being so motivated by knowing you can either make no\nbonus or like a crazy high number. It was all meritocratic,\u201d he said,\ndescribing how Uber reviewed performance data to categorize employees in one\nof six zones. \u201cIf you get slotted in zone six, you could make real numbers,\nlike six-figures. Zone five, it was a big drop to like $30,000. Then zone\nfour, it\u2019s like $15,000, then zone three \u2013 then it goes into almost nothing,\nlike $5,000 or $2,000. That\u2019s a huge spread. But because of that, everyone\nwanted a zone six and would work really hard for zone six.\u201d\n\nWhile Shebat ultimately didn\u2019t introduce that system at Traba (\u201cwe don\u2019t have\nhuge numbers of people...and that system did have its flaws\u201d), it provided an\ninteresting lesson on aligning and motivating a large workforce. By 2020, he\nwas ready to take those lessons and apply them to a challenge of his own\nmaking.\n\n##\n\n\u201cMay I have the definition, please?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlopecoid?\u201d\n\nStanding in front of the microphone is a boy in a white polo emblazoned with\nthe National Spelling Bee badge. He is thirteen but looks three years younger.\n\n\u201cAlopecoid,\u201d a man in a tan suit intones toward the stage.\n\n\u201cMay I have the definition, please?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a fox, vulpine. Alopecoid.\u201d\n\nThe child ponders, glancing at his feet. \u201cAlopecoid. May I have the language\nof origin?\u201d\n\nThe boy is Akshay Buddiga, an eighth grader from Colorado Springs. He has come\nto the Grand Hyatt in Washington, DC, not merely to compete but to win. Since\nseeing his older brother seize the title two years prior, he has sworn to\nhimself that he will equal the feat. After finishing a disappointing eighth in\nhis state the year before, this is his last chance.\n\nAgonizing pauses punctuate that question and those that follow. Then something\nhappens. Buddiga\u2019s eyes go wide and suddenly he is pitching to his left, out\nof shot, tumbling onto the stage floor. \u201cOh my god!\u201d a worried voice exclaims.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this before,\u201d the announcer says, \u201cThe poor gentleman, the\nyoung man, apparently has fainted on stage.\u201d\n\nBuddiga cuts short concerns, rising quickly and stepping back to the\nmicrophone. He begins to spell: \u201cA-l-o-p-e-c-o-i-d. Alopecoid.\u201d\n\nTwenty years on, Akshay Buddiga reflected on that moment and what was going\nthrough his mind. \u201cI was going back and forth between two ways to spell it,\u201d\nTraba\u2019s Chief Technical Officer said. \u201cAnd I ended up locking my knees and\nfainting. I fell down, I got back up, and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m just gonna go and\nspell it. Whatever happens happens.\u2019 So I went back up and spelled and they\ndidn\u2019t ring the buzzer, so I knew it was right.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the end, Buddiga would finish second in the tournament, falling short of\nhis goal. But in the years since, his fall and recovery have become a part of\nSpelling Bee lore, re-airing on ESPN and attracting hundreds of thousands of\nYouTube views. It also neatly encapsulates Traba\u2019s other founder. Though\nBuddiga cuts a milder figure than Shebat, there is no doubt he shares similar\nintensity and perseverance.\n\nDuring my early interactions with Traba\u2019s founders, Buddiga said little and\nyet there was a kind of eloquence in his silence. When he spoke, he did so\nwith the poise of someone who spent much of their life studying the English\nlanguage\u2019s long tail. Though much of Traba\u2019s previous coverage focuses on\nShebat and his ambitious goals, Buddiga is indispensable. He is a \u201cgenius\u201d by\nhis co-founder\u2019s estimation, and the key to ensuring Traba succeeds as a true\ntech business rather than a modernized staffing firm.\n\nBuddiga\u2019s journey from Spelling Bee sensation to tech CTO followed the path of\nmany an overachiever. He attended Duke University after shining in high\nschool, beginning his time in Durham as a biomedical engineering major. At\nleast in part, that focus was an attempt to carve a career distinct from his\nfather, an experienced network engineer. The slowness of the younger Buddiga\u2019s\nchosen field eventually dissuaded him from pursuing life in a laboratory,\nguiding him toward the more rapid, iterative world of software. A Master\u2019s in\nManagement Science & Engineering at Stanford allowed Buddiga to strengthen his\nskills and add business acumen.\n\nA Product Operations role at Zenefits followed, where he got to experience the\nbenefits and drawbacks of hockey stick growth. \u201cThe company had just raised a\nSeries B and was scaling insanely fast,\u201d Buddiga recalled. \u201cAt the time, it\nwas the fastest-growing B2B company in Silicon Valley history or something\nlike that. It was a boot camp for hyper-growth, essentially.\u201d His 16 months\nunder founder and then-CEO Parker Conrad left him with an appreciation for\nstartups and the intensity it took to win. \u201cAfter that experience, I was like,\n\u2018Startups are great.\u2019 They\u2019re a kind of insane experience to go through.\u201d\n\nIf Zenefits was about speed, Buddiga\u2019s five years at Fanatics focused on\nscale. He joined the sports apparel manufacturer and retailer to help it\nrebuild its tech stack from scratch to enable global scale. \u201cIt was a really\ninteresting technical opportunity,\u201d Buddiga said, though he knew it wouldn\u2019t\nbe a permanent resting place. When the CTO asked Buddiga during the\nrecruitment process where he hoped to be in five years, Buddiga responded, \u201cI\nwant to start a company.\u201d\n\nBy 2020, he and his team succeeded in their mission. \u201cWe accomplished all the\ngoals we set out to do \u2013 we went global, did multi-language and multi-\ncurrency, launched in Europe and Japan, did all that stuff,\u201d he said.\nBuddiga\u2019s successes at Fanatics set him up to take the entrepreneurial leap\nhe\u2019d forecasted in his interviews. It is an indication of his methodical\nnature that he did not rush to take that next step.\n\nIn late fall that year, Buddiga took a solo hike in Marin County, an idyllic\npatch on the west side of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge. He used the walk\nto clear his head and ask himself what he wanted from his life. \u201cI journaled\nand wrote some stuff down,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI basically thought about it from\nthe regret minimization perspective. [I asked myself,] \u2018If I look back five or\nten years from now, or even from my deathbed, which of these options am I\ngoing to regret more? If I start a company and it fails, am I going to regret\nnot working at an early-stage startup somewhere?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Not really,\nbecause I\u2019ll just join another one.\u2019\u201d It was November 3, 2020 \u2013 election day\nin America. A day of decisions.\n\nTraba's founders Akshay Buddiga and Mike Shebat in Miami (Traba)\n\nBecoming an entrepreneur is not as simple as choosing to be one. If Buddiga\nwere going to fulfill his ambitions, he would need an idea and, perhaps, a\nbusiness partner. To accelerate the process, he joined On Deck, an online\naccelerator and provider of virtual courses. It immediately delivered. In the\ndays leading up to the program\u2019s kick-off events, participants were encouraged\nto post introductions in Slack, outlining their professional backgrounds and\nambitions. \u201cEveryone is writing these long, amazing breakdowns,\u201d Buddiga\nremembered. \u201cAll these super talented people \u2013 crazy backgrounds, amazing\nexperiences. People that have started a company, sold companies.\u201d As Buddiga\nscrolled, his fiance watched over his shoulder, silently assessing. When he\nreached a post written by someone named Mike Shebat, she stopped him: \u201cThis\nguy\u2019s a winner. You should definitely talk to him.\u201d\n\n##\n\n\u201cThe whole space is literally broken.\u201d\n\nShebat didn\u2019t rush his departure from Uber. Before taking a swing at\nentrepreneurship, he would ensure he was as prepared as possible. During the\nsourdough and sweatpants days of the pandemic, Shebat decided it was time he\nlearned about venture capital. \u201cI took a Kauffman Fellows class. And then I\nalso read a book called Venture Deals. Honestly, I think there was probably\ntoo much detail in both of those.\u201d\n\nHe also began digging into the market he\u2019d observed at McMaster-Carr. Was the\nindustrial staffing process really as broken as it had appeared to be? And\neven if it was, could a generational company be built to address its many\nostensible problems? The more Shebat learned, the greater his conviction grew.\n\nHe discovered that hiring was, indeed, a large and acute problem. In 2022, the\nglobal staffing market was estimated at $648 billion. Despite some dips, the\nsegment grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4.2% between 2008 and 2022.\n(The available figures for 2023 appear slightly more variable and less\nreliable.) The US market was estimated to be worth $219 billion in 2022, with\nthe industrial segment pegged at $37.1 billion. In the years before the\npandemic, staffing supplied job opportunities for 16 million Americans \u2013\nexperiencing a downturn during lockdown.\n\nCompanies like McMaster-Carr spent millions of dollars a year on temporary\nindustrial workers, relying on legacy providers. He found a slew of staffing\nagencies clearing a billion dollars or more in annual revenue, indicating the\nmarket\u2019s size and fragmentation. An independent report suggests that as many\nas 60 companies earned $100 million or more in revenue from US operations. The\nindustry\u2019s three biggest players \u2013 Randstad, Adecco, and Manpower \u2013 comprise a\nmere 12% of the market.\n\nIn Shebat\u2019s view, these companies had managed to clip nine-figure earnings\nwith sub-standard offerings, failing to meet customer demand and\ninsufficiently vetting workers. \u201cThe real thing that makes you good or bad [at\none of these jobs] is like, \u2018Can you show up to work on time? Can you actually\nwork hard while you\u2019re in the facility? Can you not get in fights with people?\nCan you be polite, have a good attitude? Can you lift heavy things? Do you\nhave attention to detail?\u2019 [There\u2019s] a lack of control and transparency.\u201d\n\nThe system worked little better for the temps themselves. \u201cThere used to be a\ndynamic in the United States where you go work for Pepsi-Cola and you\u2019re there\nfor 30 years and you get a pension, you can retire. That\u2019s just not how things\nwork anymore,\u201d Shebat said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really a career path. You\u2019re stacking\nboxes until you don\u2019t. And then maybe you can manage others.\u201d\n\nThe lack of information about temporary workers hurts not only businesses but\nalso the workers themselves. An excellent reputation putting in the hours at\none warehouse isn\u2019t transferred to another, making it difficult to rise\nthrough the ranks or earn rewards for your efforts. It\u2019s also difficult to\nknow what a given environment will be like before showing up. \u201cSay you find\nout this warehouse facility down the block pays more, you show up, and you\u2019re\nlike, \u2018Oh my god, it\u2019s so hot in here.\u2019 They don\u2019t turn on the air\nconditioning, the supervisor\u2019s selling drugs, someone is doing shady things.\nIt\u2019s really hard. Long story short, the whole space is literally broken.\u201d Mike\nShebat joined the On Deck program in 2021 to bring his idea for a tech-forward\nlight industrial staffing platform to life. He would call it Traba.\n\nAfter meeting in the early days of the On Deck program, Shebat and Akshay\nBuddiga approached the possibility of partnering up with reasonable caution.\nBuoyed by the adrenaline of a new idea, it is easy for founders to pair off\ntoo quickly, jumping into a marriage doomed to fail from the beginning. To\nreduce their chances of a future divorce, the pair talked through their\ndifferent ambitions, working styles, and decision-making processes. They\nwalked through potential black swan episodes and edge cases \u2013 how would they\nhandle them?\n\nIn the course of their dating process, the topic of work ethic arose. What did\nthey expect of each other? What did they expect of themselves? \u201cBoth of us\nwere very much aligned that this [business] was going to be the primary focus\nof our lives,\u201d Buddiga said. \u201cIn order to build something massive that\u2019s going\nto make a huge impact on the world, you need to put everything into it.\u201d\nThough they didn\u2019t have neat slogans to summarize their commitment, the\nmessage was clear: Shebat and Buddiga would build a generational business or\nburn themselves to cider trying.\n\nIt was finally time for Shebat to leave Uber and Traba to raise a seed round.\nWith typical farsightedness, Shebat had begun wooing venture capitalists\nmonths earlier. After downloading an Airtable listing of active investors in\nhis new hometown of Miami, he started reaching out to them, setting up\nmeetings. Not all were productive.\n\n\u201cI did meet with a lot of investors before I met with Keith and a lot of them\nwere not that nice,\u201d Shebat recalled. \u201cI\u2019d meet with one of them, he\u2019d give me\nhomework to do, it was a weird environment. Then he'd whisk away in his BMW\ndown to Brickell.\u201d\n\nShebat\u2019s outreach to Rabois, then at Founders Fund, proved much more\nproductive. It also offers an example of what a good cold outreach strategy\nlooks like. \u201cI went to Keith\u2019s Twitter,\u201d Shebat said. \u201cTop of funnel for any\nsale is, \u2018Who is my customer?\u2019 I saw that he\u2019s really into Barry\u2019s and I\u2019m\nreally into Barry\u2019s too. So I reached out to him on LinkedIn and instead of\nbeing like, \u2018Let\u2019s get coffee\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m sure he gets reached out to for coffee\nevery day \u2013 I was like, \u2018Let\u2019s do a Barry\u2019s class.\u2019 And, of course, he would\nsay yes because he goes every single day.\u201d\n\nAfter sweating through squats and bicep curls, Rabois and Shebat went to a\ncoffee shop to talk. The then-Uber employee played the long game. \u201cI never\nreally mentioned Traba, I just talked broadly like, \u2018Hey, what do you do for\nwork?\u2019 Just getting to know him better. I never really pitched Traba until\nlike six months later.\u201d\n\nOver the following months, Shebat built a friendship with Rabois and broadened\nhis venture network, attending industry events in Miami. \u201cI was at the right\nplace at the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was early 2021, Miami was open and a\nlot of venture capitalists and people were in Miami. That\u2019s how I met\nKatherine Boyle (then an investor at General Catalyst, today a General Partner\nat a16z). Then I was invited to Peter Thiel\u2019s house for dinner at some point.\nI got to know these people at a high level without really pitching.\u201d\n\nShebat with investor and advisor Peter Thiel (Traba)\n\nWhat would Shebat say at these events if he didn\u2019t discuss his idea? \u201cWhen I\nwas introducing myself to people, I was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m in product at Uber,\nbut I\u2019m going to be building something big eventually. I\u2019m not going to talk\nabout it right now. But that\u2019s basically where my head\u2019s at.\u2019\u201d\n\nShebat\u2019s preparation meant that when it was time to raise, the process moved\nswiftly. Rabois remembered his response when Shebat walked through Traba\u2019s\ndeck at their next coffee meeting. \u201cMy first reaction was a great sigh of\nrelief,\u201d Rabois said. \u201cYou\u2019re friends with somebody and they\u2019re alluding to\nstarting a company and hopefully they're going to work on something\ninteresting. But you don\u2019t always know.\u201d Thankfully for both of them, that\nwasn\u2019t the case. \u201cThe first draft was extremely strong.\u201d\n\nFour points in particular resonated with Rabois, outside of the tenacity and\nseriousness he\u2019d already observed in Shebat. Firstly, Traba was attacking a\nlarge market \u2013 \u201csignificantly larger than my intuition or anyone\u2019s intuition,\u201d\nhe said. Secondly, large businesses had been built in the space, but all\nseemed \u201cdefective or broken down.\u201d Thirdly, none of those players had\nsignificant market share. And finally, Shebat\u2019s time at McMaster-Carr and Uber\nmeant he had the ideal resum\u00e9. \u201cAs soon as he connected the dots for me, I was\nlike, \u2018Ok, this is a great market opportunity and you\u2019re very well suited to\ndo this.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn July 2021, Traba raised a $3.6 million seed, co-led by Founders Fund and\nGeneral Catalyst. Not long after, Shebat and Buddiga enjoyed a moment of sweet\nrevenge. The venture capitalists with the BMW that had strung them along for\nmonths arrived at the Founders Fund office one day to find the pair ensconced\nin their work. \u201cHe walks in and he\u2019s like, \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Shebat recalled.\n\u201cAnd Akshay and I are like, \u2018Oh, yeah we got an investment from Founders\nFund.\u2019\u201d Faced with an obstacle in his path, Shebat had found another, better\nside door.\n\n##\n\n\u201cDream Big\u201d\n\nBefore I can even get into the elevator, someone from Traba has introduced\nthemselves. They\u2019re returning to work after a short trip to grab food or\nperhaps a final boost of caffeine. We chat for a moment as we ride up to the\nfourth floor.\n\nIt is 7:00 PM on President\u2019s Day and the office is full. Employees sit or\nstand at their desks, gently illuminated by a purple neon \u201cTraba\u201d sign. I do\nnot want to oversell it. It is not some frenetic, boiling cauldron of\nHufflepuff energy, sales team striking a gong, engineers arguing over a\nvertical monitor, a sole product manager karate chopping through a stack of\nbricks. It is an ordinary scene, except for the hour. People are working,\nthere is brisk chatter, meetings fill a few of the rooms.\n\nI am in the place for no more than thirty seconds before several employees\ncome up and introduce themselves, full of friendly energy. For a moment, this\nthrows me. Why are they so prepared? Has Traba constructed this tableau for my\nbenefit? Have I walked into a Potemkin startup?\n\nSuch is the writer\u2019s ego. There are no signs of trick walls, and if this is a\nperformance, the performance seems to be: build a great startup for the next\ntwenty years or more.\n\nFor the next two hours, I sit in a conference room and talk with Mike Shebat\nand Akshay Buddiga. We walk through their latest board deck, cultural tenets,\nand stories up to this point. We discuss the investors they have worked with\nand how they rely on them. They are frank with their numbers and how they\noperate. For fifteen minutes, Shebat recounts a recent all-hands meeting in\nwhich he explained why Traba had let a few underperforming team members go. In\nseveral of these moments, I am struck by how crisp a communicator Shebat seems\nto be, finding a way to compress complicated trade-offs into clear, persuasive\nlanguage.\n\nTraba's office celebrating hitting $5 million in annualized revenue (Traba)\n\nAfterward, I am given free rein to wander through the rows of desks. The\nengineering team walks me through a few products; I speak with them about\ntheir journeys to and at Traba. At 9:30 PM, I leave, the antithesis of a Traba\nemployee: last in, first out.\n\nThough Buddiga and Shebat committed to work at maximum intensity when starting\nthe project, they didn\u2019t have to define Traba\u2019s cultural values until it was\ntime to make their first hire. Once again, Founders Fund served as the\nlocation, though this time, Traba\u2019s leadership brainstormed from the firm\u2019s\nSan Francisco office. \u201cBefore we put up a job description, we needed to align\non our values,\u201d Buddiga said. \u201cThe values we\u2019re going to set for the company\nand that the people we\u2019re going to hire need to actually commit to. And that\u2019s\nwhen we wrote them down.\u201d\n\nThey decided on four primary values:\n\n  1. Dream Big\n\n  2. Olympian\u2019s Work Ethic\n\n  3. Growth Mindset\n\n  4. Customer Obsession\n\nIf you are a naturally skeptical person, this will not strike you as a\nparticularly inspired quartet. None would be out of place on a motivation\nposter from the 1980s, set in front of a stunning mountain vista or soaring\neagle. You can imagine a senile self-help guru muttering these phrases to\nhimself in his old age, right after telling the toaster to buck up its ideas.\n\nTraba's controversial \"Big Four\" values (Traba)\n\nBut the mark of a good cultural value isn\u2019t originality or elegant wording.\nIt\u2019s how it sets norms and drives behavior. By this measure, Traba\u2019s values\nmay be the most successful of any company I have studied at this stage. Shebat\nand Buddiga have found language that galvanizes action, promotes hard work and\nbig swings, attracts investors and deters poor cultural fits. Who cares if\nthey aren\u2019t novel?\n\nAs much as Traba\u2019s values matter, the expectations and ambitions that come\nwith them count just as much. Each of the company\u2019s Big Four ladder down into\nclear tenets, explanations for why they matter, and examples of aligned\nbehavior. To have an \u201cOlympian\u2019s Work Ethic,\u201d it is not enough to simply work\nhard; you must \u201cplay for the front of the jersey,\u201d \u201cmove fast by nature,\u201d and\n\u201cput the time in \u2013 especially in-person.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this final tenet that has attracted most attention. In Traba\u2019s early\ndays, the company explicitly asked new hires to commit to a \u201c9-9-6\u201d schedule,\nmeaning team members worked from 9 AM to 9 PM, six days a week. It has\nintroduced greater flexibility in the three years since without losing much of\nits intensity. Today, employees are expected to work in-office for at least 60\nhours a week, arriving no later than 9:15 AM. However, if you want to head out\nearly one day to meet up with friends and stay late the next, that is no\nlonger verboten. If travel keeps you from hitting the 60-hour threshold one\nweek, you should plan on working 12+ hour days to catch up afterward.\n\nThese requirements have proved controversial. As tech\u2019s talent war has heated\nup over the past couple of decades, workers have begun to expect greater\nflexibility and fewer demands. While \u201cwork-life balance\u201d is a concept that\nholds little weight in high finance, management consulting, white-collar law\nfirms, or medical residencies, it is something of a sacred cow at large tech\ncompanies and even some startups. Candidates at Google, Meta, or the latest\nhot Series B recipient are wooed by the promise of good perks and reasonable\nhours. Though there are undoubtedly very hard-working people at these\ncompanies (I know several), there also seems to be more space for well-\neducated loafers, surfing the surplus of time, space, and snacks. HBO show\nSilicon Valley went as far as to build a character around this stereotype:\nNelson \u201cBig Head\u201d Bighetti, who spends his days drinking Big Gulps on his\nemployer\u2019s empty roof.\n\nNelson Bighetti, a symbol of Silicon Valley's sloth (HBO)\n\nThe result is that any time a company challenges these norms, it faces an\ninevitable backlash on social media, cries of slave-driving and soul-crushing.\nOn its face, this is a strange response to the reality of building a startup.\nBy definition, startups are the most fragile of enterprises. The odds are that\nthey will die. Only through ingenuity, sweat, and luck do some stay alive. Why\nshould that process require fewer than a litigator learning their craft or a\nsurgeon in training?\n\nIt becomes even odder when Silicon Valley\u2019s culture of employee ownership is\nfactored in. While the McKinsey consultant may clip a significantly better\nsalary than the PM at a Series A startup, only one has a stake in a business\nthat might appreciate 1,000x and whose work directly impacts the likelihood of\nthat happening. The odds may be against you, but if you are optimizing for\nupside, there are fewer better opportunities. As Ryan Delk, founder of edtech\nPrimer and friend of Shebat\u2019s, said, \u201cAnyone that says you don\u2019t have to work\nhard to build a startup \u2013 they\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\nStartups were not always seen as relaxed landing spots. For several years,\nrenowned investors like Mike Moritz have been calling attention to the\ndeclining working standards in Silicon Valley. In a 2018 Financial Times op-\ned, he exhorted American startups to emulate the work ethic and frugality of\ntheir Chinese peers. \u201cIn recent months, there have been complaints about the\npolitical sensibilities of speakers invited to address a corporate audience;\ndebates over the appropriate length of paternity leave or work-life balances;\nand grumbling about the need for a space for musical jam sessions,\u201d Moritz\nwrites, recapping various Silicon Valley gripes. \u201cThese seem like the concerns\nof a society that is becoming unhinged. These topics are absent in China\u2019s\ntechnology companies, where the pace of work is furious.\u201d Coming from someone\nwho closely observed the ascendance of many of the Valley\u2019s great businesses,\nthose words have particular weight.\n\nThough Moritz\u2019s alarm arrived in 2018, Keith Rabois believes the rot set in\nsometime around the mid-2010s and the release of the Social Network, David\nFincher\u2019s film chronicling the Machiavellian rise of a young Mark Zuckerberg.\nIn the wake of that movie and the broader industry changes at play, becoming a\nfounder and working in tech became \u201ccool,\u201d bringing in tourists lacking the\noddball fanaticism of previous generations. \u201cWe\u2019ve regressed as an American\nculture in terms of willingness to pursue ambition, generally speaking across\nsociety,\u201d Rabois said. The result is that Traba represents an outlier in the\ncurrent environment but less so when compared to the great companies of\nprevious years \u2013 PayPal, for example. \u201cOn an absolute scale, Traba\u2019s work\nethic might be slightly below that of PayPal. [PayPal was] in the top 1%, but\n[Mike\u2019s] in the top ten basis points [today], because the culture has\nchanged.\u201d\n\nThe result of Traba\u2019s anomalous standards is that it is explicitly not a fit\nfor everyone. Every job has trade-offs and these are theirs: you will earn\nless than you might have among the Fortune 500 but receive generous equity\ngrants, you will work with highly motivated peers but have little to no social\nlife, you will get little structure but considerable responsibility, you will\ngive it everything you have but that may still not be enough. If that sounds\nlike the life you want, fantastic. If not, no judgment.\n\nRather than convincing candidates to embrace its intense work ethic, Traba\ndoes the opposite. \u201cWe anti-sell them when we give an offer,\u201d Shebat said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to anti-sell you really hard, I\u2019m going to tell\nyou why you shouldn\u2019t join.\u201d By being unapologetic about the company\u2019s culture\nand walking through its trade-offs, Traba keeps attrition low. \u201cIf you join,\nevery single person here ends up loving our offices. They\u2019re like, \u2018Great! The\npeople are a lot smarter than I thought they would be, everyone\u2019s really\ncollaborative and really good.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor people like Head of Finance Jessica Xu, Shebat\u2019s warning about long hours\nwas exactly what she wanted to hear. Before joining Traba, Xu worked as an\ninvestment associate at Softbank and at South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang\nas CFO of its food delivery division. After those high-octane experiences, Xu\nsought a startup with the same intensity as the Asian leaders she had backed\nor helped build. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is awesome.\u2019 I\u2019m a very intense worker and\nI think over the last few years, I\u2019ve just come to accept that I\u2019m a little\nbit of a workaholic. And so when I work with people, especially at a startup,\nyou want to work with people who all want to win.\u201d\n\nProduct manager Owen Mahoney had a similar response after hearing about\nTraba\u2019s expectations. \u201cFor me, it was definitely attractive. And I think if\nyou talk to a lot of members of our team, it is one of the things that is very\nattractive. It\u2019s a kind of self-selection of \u201cAlright, I want to work hard.\u2019\u201d\n\nNaturally, Traba does have some turnover. \u201cWe did have people that joined \u2013\nnot that many, a couple \u2013 being like, \u2018[Working like an Olympian] sounds good\nto me, but I\u2019ve never done it before. Let\u2019s give it a shot.\u2019 And then they\u2019d\nbe like, \u2018Oh, everyone actually works a lot. It's a huge commitment, and\nthat\u2019s not going to work with me,\u2019\u201d Shebat recounted. \u201cSo we did have a couple\npeople decide in the beginning [to leave]. The sooner you find that out, the\nbetter for both parties. That person can go look for another job.\u201d\n\nI wondered: who tended to be a fit for Traba\u2019s culture? Had Shebat or Buddiga\nobserved any patterns? \u201cPeople that like the American flag tend to do well in\nenvironments like this,\u201d Shebat said, pointing to the massive flag draped\nacross the red brick of a Traba meeting room.\n\nReally? \u201cIt\u2019s actually a bigger thing with Varda and Flexport. Ryan Petersen\nand Delian [Asparouhov] have also said they put huge American flags [in their\noffices] and it's like garlic for the worst types of people. I don\u2019t know what\nit is,\u201d Shebat admits. \u201cMaybe some people see it and think \u2018Oh, that means the\nAmerican Dream \u2013 if I work hard, I can do something.\u2019 And whether [other]\npeople look at it and they\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s an unfair system\u2019 \u2013 like it almost\nbleeds into how they think about their job. I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n\nTraba's American Flag, a subtle hiring filter (Traba)\n\nAs well as warding off international vampires, Traba\u2019s culture attracts former\nfounders. \u201cWe definitely have a few people who have either started a company\npreviously or were early at a company,\u201d Buddiga said. \u201cThey\u2019re attracted to\nTraba because they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this is a rocket ship taking off. I want to\njoin and be a part of that journey. Because it didn't work out for me on what\nI tried before but I still have that fire.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese facets amount to a culture provocative enough to capture attention,\ndifferentiated enough to filter talent, and sufficiently magnetic to its\ntarget audience. Ryan Delk summarized the genius of Traba\u2019s approach: \u201cMike\nrealized he could build a brand that was contrarian among the masses, but\nconsensus among the top 1% performers.\u201d\n\n##\n\n\u201cJust go do it.\u201d\n\nA couple of days after my evening visit, I returned to the office for a\nproduct tour. By then, I understood the problem Traba was solving and the\nimprovements it offered compared to traditional staffing firms. Using Buddiga\nand Shebat\u2019s platform, manufacturers like American Nitrile \u2013 a maker of blue\nrubber gloves used by medical professionals \u2013 accessed vetted talent faster\nand more transparently. Rather than limping by with half the workers they\u2019d\nasked for after a seven-day wait, Traba averaged a 96% fill rate with a\nturnaround time of just 6 hours. How?\n\nTraba operates three core products, each playing a role in delivering\nimpressive, superior service:\n\n  1. An ops console\n\n  2. A business portal\n\n  3. A worker app\n\nThe best way to understand the impact of these applications is to telescope\ninwards, telling the story of a market, a company, and a worker.\n\nBecause Traba deals with real workers in the physical world, it opens up\nmarkets geographically. To operate effectively in Texas, it must recruit\nbusinesses with staffing needs and workers looking for shifts. To deliver on\nits promises, Traba specifically needs a surplus of reliable laborers, enough\nto fill a shift at close to 100% capacity in 6 hours or less. It\u2019s\nstructurally similar to how companies like Uber have expanded.\n\nTo start, Traba gets to work securing demand. While existing clients from one\nstate may have operations in another, smoothing the path, much relies on cold\noutreach and hard graft. Read Egger, Traba\u2019s Head of Growth, led the Texas\nexpansion. He outlined how they moved into the market and some of the lessons\nlearned in the process. It illustrates Traba\u2019s culture in action and the\nupstream work required to make a successful shift happen.\n\n\u201cWe just flew to Austin, started knocking on doors and cold calling people. I\nclosed my first business honestly from dumb luck,\u201d he said. After securing\nthat business, Traba\u2019s growth in the state stalled, prompting a discussion\nbetween Egger, Mike Shebat, and Luis De La Lastra, Head of Operations. \u201cIt was\nlike, \u2018You need to step it up, and why aren\u2019t you selling more,\u2019\u201d Egger\nrecalled. \u201cOf course, my first reaction was, \u2018I\u2019m not a fucking seller.\u2019 I\ndidn\u2019t say that. But then I was like, \u2018Ok, that\u2019s bullshit. Just go do it.\u2019\u201d\nOver the following weeks, Egger retooled Traba\u2019s sales process. \u201cI decided the\nway we pitched was absolute trash.\u201d\n\nHe realized that because of the low trust businesses had for traditional\nstaffing firms, the benefits Traba promised \u2013 100% fill rates, no lock-ins,\n24/7 support, top 1% of the workforce \u2013 came across as another pie-in-the-sky\nfantasy, a pitch not to be taken seriously. \u201cOur sell went from being a\nsales-y sell to an operations sell. The other thing sounds like everything\nelse. I realized I just need to talk to these people and tell them like I\u2019m an\nengineer, \u2018Here\u2019s how I\u2019m going to work with their business.\u2019\u201d The switch\nworked, with eight new customers joining the next month \u2013 three of whom are\nnow among Traba\u2019s top ten clients.\n\nTraba's fill rate (Traba, HRZone)\n\nIn tandem with securing demand, Traba signs up supply. \u201c[We look on] every\ntype of job board you can think of,\u201d Egger said. \u201cCalling workers, asking them\nif they have family or friends that want to work. Getting them to refer to\nother workers. Going to different events and seeing if people want to sign up\nfor Traba. We have some targeted Google ads that are really good for that too,\nlooking for light industrial workers. It\u2019s all these levers. [But] you\u2019ve got\nto call every single person if you want to [convert people.]\u201d\n\nLaunching a new market can be a grueling process but exciting for a certain\ntype of person. \u201cI made the choice that I did not want any help [launching\nTexas]. I wanted to do it completely alone,\u201d Egger said. \u201c[The process] made\nme realize that I am not too good for any task on this planet, including\ncalling workers convincing them to go to a job, processing pay at two in the\nmorning, setting an alarm for 4 AM to drive to an event center. I was working\n120 hours per week.\u201d\n\nAs Traba\u2019s tech has developed, the process has become easier. Egger witnessed\nthat change part way through running the Texan gauntlet. \u201cI got to see our\ntech develop. It went from the second month where I was near tears on four\nhours of sleep seven days a week, borderline manic. And there was one where I\nwas sleeping 50 to 60 minutes a night. And then, all of a sudden, a couple of\nmonths in they started pushing out new updates to our tech and it started\nbecoming more doable, more possible.\u201d\n\nThough improvements to all three of Traba\u2019s core products helped lift Egger\u2019s\nload, the ops console was particularly important. As the company has matured,\nit has added tooling to programmatically vet, coordinate, and contact workers.\n\nFor example, Traba uses an AI bot to talk to workers and ensure they meet the\nrequirements of a given job. In the past, those calls would have been made\ndirectly by someone like Egger. If a client needed more workers at the last\nminute, he also would have had to call around directly. Now, Traba relies on a\ntool called \u201cBugle\u201d that makes it easy to segment the worker base and send an\nSMS blast, push notification, or automated phone call to the most suitable\ncandidates.\n\nTraba's ops console helps automate the staffing process (Traba)\n\nTraba uses AI voice startup ElevenLabs to make its calls sound as human as\npossible, as Akshay Buddiga explained. \u201cWe generate a voice message that pulls\nin information about the company, the role, everything else. It\u2019ll say, \u201cWe\nhave a role at Drop Foods as a production laborer that starts at 6 AM. If\nyou\u2019re interested, we can send you more information, just press \u20181.\u2019 It\u2019s\ntrained on one of our operations folks so it\u2019s more of a human-sounding\nmessage, almost like a voicemail.\u201d\n\nThe improvement in Traba\u2019s technology has given it increasing leverage. While\nit took Traba a year to fill its first 100-worker shift, Egger shared how,\nwhen launching Arizona, the team successfully filled a 150-worker shift just\nfour days after entering the market. In that same time frame, Traba signed up\n2,500 workers. Not that it came easy. \u201cI locked myself in an Airbnb for four\ndays, just hammering Celsius and candy,\u201d Egger said.\n\nThis is how a new market is made: through sleepless nights, energy drinks,\ncold calls, and scaling technology. Stories like Egger\u2019s either ignite your\nblood or send you sprinting to touch grass. Whatever your response, this is\nhow Traba\u2019s business begins.\n\nOnce Traba signs a client, it doesn\u2019t take them long to onboard onto the\nbusiness portal. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty fast,\u201d Buddiga said. \u201cYou go through the signup\nprocess, you tell us your location, what type of work you do. You know, \u2018Am I\na product facility? Am I a 3PL? Am I cold storage?\u2019 Once you enter all of\nthat, you create your account. You can invite your teammates to your account\nto get set up. And from there, I can just go ahead and book a shift.\u201d\n\nAs part of setting up a shift, employers will share more information about the\nfacility and job requirements. The range of companies that rely on temporary\nlabor means there can be considerable variability in environment and staffing\nneeds. \u201cFor example, we work with a customer that bakes all the biscuits for\nPopeye\u2019s,\u201d Buddiga said. \u201cMillions of biscuits a week. So one of their\nfacilities is pretty hot because it\u2019s industrial baking. And then the other\nfacility is actually pretty cold because it's doing all the deserts and stuff\nlike that.\u201d Including these kinds of insights, alongside details like language\nrequirements, the necessity to lift heavy objects, or experience using certain\nequipment ensures a good match between business and worker.\n\nOnce those details are added, Traba works to staff the necessary shift. The\nbusiness can participate in this process if it likes, inviting workers it\u2019s\n\u201cfavorited\u201d previously. Otherwise, Traba will push a job posting out to its\nworker base, starting from the most suitable and highest-rated workers. The\nresult is that a business automatically gets the best available workers for\nthe job at hand.\n\nAs a shift approaches, the client can send messages to scheduled workers\nasking questions or sharing further information. Chat between businesses and\nworkers is time-gated, available only for a short period before and during a\nshift.\n\nOn the morning of a shift, businesses can monitor the number of confirmed\nworkers and their location. Are they heading to the facility? Does their\ncurrent ETA put them on time or late? Do you need to put out a blast for last-\nminute replacements? Knowing this information can make a considerable\ndifference, allowing the client to adjust how they tackle the job in question.\nTraditional staffing agencies offer none of this visibility.\n\nOnce workers arrive, they check in via a kiosk, with their app, or directly\nwith a supervisor. During a shift, businesses and on-site supervisors can\ntrack where workers are within the facility, reducing the likelihood of\ntruancy.\n\nThe business portal empowers customers to book shifts and monitor workers\n(Traba)\n\nAt the end of the shift, supervisors rate each worker and provide free-form\ncommentary. Traba uses this feedback to make better matches going forward. If\na company wishes, it can \u201cblock\u201d a particular worker, ensuring that they won\u2019t\nbe matched to one of its shifts in the future. Traba uses computer vision to\npull data from timesheets directly into the portal, automatically detecting\nany discrepancies in need of review.\n\nClients can see upcoming shifts with a neat calendar view and book new ones as\nneeded. They can also review high-level worker metrics. How many shifts has\nsomeone worked for you? How does that translate into hours? What is their\noverall rating? For customers like American Nitrile, this information is\ninvaluable. \u201cWe track our metrics very closely every week,\u201d CFO Andy Roos\nsaid. \u201cOvertime was always a problem for us. We didn\u2019t really have any ability\nto manage that with [other] agencies.\u201d The result was that American Nitrile\nended up with too many temps working at a higher hourly rate. They\u2019d only\ndiscover the issue at the end of the month when reviewing the bill from their\nstaffing agency.\n\nOne of Traba's customers, American Nitrile, a maker of rubber gloves (American\nNitrile)\n\nOnce they implemented Traba, American Nitrile could monitor workers\u2019 hours and\nperformance much more closely, changing their staffing process. \u201c[We just\nmade] it more rule-based upfront. Like, \u2018Hey guys, if great people are\nstarting to look like they\u2019re going to hit that 40-hour peak \u2013 but they\u2019re\nloving it and we\u2019re loving their work \u2013 then let us know. And maybe we can\ngive them a full-time offer because they\u2019re probably a great worker. But\nrather than paying them time and a half, let\u2019s supplement them with a second\nperson. [With Traba] we can do that \u2013 set those rules up front and then see on\na daily basis in the app that it\u2019s in compliance, rather than getting it in an\ninvoice a month later.\u201d\n\nAdding even greater visibility is a focus for Traba, especially as it looks to\nwin more enterprise customers. \u201cThe biggest thing that we\u2019re pushing for this\nyear is going further upmarket, so we\u2019re closing larger customers and bigger\ndeals,\u201d Buddiga explained. \u201cPart of that means these customers have different\nneeds. If you\u2019re more like, \u2018Hey I\u2019m operating in Houston and I have three\nfacilities, a few supervisors, and an AP person\u2019 \u2013 Ok, that\u2019s fine. But now\nit\u2019s like, we\u2019re closing a national deal, and you\u2019re across eight different\nstates and 12 different locations. And you\u2019ll need 25 people accessing this\nand you have different types of personas. It\u2019s like, \u2018I have my VP of\nOperations that wants to analyze what my productivity and labor spend is in\nTexas versus Florida.\u2019\u201d Soon, Traba hopes to offer businesses a way to track\noutput per facility, feedback on supervisors, workforce quality, workforce\nretention, and perhaps a dozen other metrics. \u201cOne of the bigger things we\u2019ll\nbe building out in the next few months is reporting and analytics\nfunctionality. Because that\u2019s what some of these larger customers with more\ncomplex needs want to see.\u201d\n\nTraba\u2019s worker app appears to be its most fully featured product. It is a one-\nstop shop for finding shifts, managing them, and getting paid.\n\nPotential workers start by downloading the app and filling out their profile.\nThat includes adding details about their skills and experience and available\nequipment. They also agree to a background check via Checkr. Workers can add\nrelevant certifications, such as a forklift driving license, to supplement\ntheir profile and make themselves more attractive to employers. If they plan\non applying to jobs that require lifting, they can record a video of\nthemselves lifting a heavy item to demonstrate their suitability.\n\nAn in-app \u201cTraining Center\u201d offers modules detailing \u201cGood Manufacturing\nPractices\u201d or particular packing techniques. Though not a formal\ncertification, Buddiga noted that clients frequently prefer workers with \u201cGMP\u201d\ntraining.\n\nOnce onboard, workers see available shifts and can sign up for them, provided\nthey meet the requirements. If a shift is full, they can sign up as a \u201cpaid\nbackup.\u201d Backups stay available in case of a last-minute cancellation. If a\nshift stays full \u2013 no problem, you get paid $35. It\u2019s a nifty innovation from\nTraba that keeps fill rates high and serves both customers and workers.\n\nWorkers can find shifts and get paid through Traba's app (Traba)\n\nBefore attending a shift, Traba provides the worker with the exact location\nand several reminders. The morning of, workers receive a push notification\nasking for final confirmation, which activates location tracking. As long as a\nworker has a good reputation on the platform and there aren\u2019t any unusual\nbehaviors during the shift (for example, leaving the facility for an extended\nperiod), Traba pays workers minutes after they clock off.\n\nAny anomalies are detected using Traba\u2019s fraud detection feature, \u201cWarden.\u201d\n\u201cIt basically takes a lot of the past data we\u2019ve accumulated and the cases\nwe\u2019ve done things that are abnormal, like they\u2019ve left the site or one worker\nhas a significantly different clock in or clock out time than the other\nworkers on the shift,\u201d Buddiga explained. \u201cIt\u2019s basically taking all these\nsignals and saying, \u2018Is this abnormal? Should this be flagged for review?\u2019\nBecause of all that data, we can get an extremely high level of accuracy to\nsay, \u2018This person should be paid out, this person should not paid out.\u2019\u201d\nBuddiga hopes an upgrade named \u201cSuperWarden\u201d will increase Traba\u2019s accuracy\neven further.\n\nThis \u201cInstant Pay\u201d is a huge benefit for workers and strongly incentives them\nto remain in good standing, arriving on time and earning positive reviews from\nemployers. Workers who show up late, receive poor reviews, or wander off lose\naccess to \u201cInstant Pay\u201d but can earn it back.\n\nTo further incentivize useful behavior, the app includes a \u201cBonus Center.\u201d\nWorkers receive a bonus every time they refer someone who completes three\nshifts. It\u2019s proven to be an extremely effective channel for acquiring high-\nquality laborers. \u201cIf you are a Tier 1 worker and you refer someone, it\u2019s four\ntimes more likely that person will be a Tier 1 worker as well,\u201d Buddiga said.\nHistorically, Traba has also offered bonuses for arriving on time consistently\n(a nice way to ensure a new customer has a great experience) or for completing\na certain number of shifts with one client.\n\nAfter walking through the sweep of Traba\u2019s product with Buddiga, I was\nimpressed by its scope, efficiency, and pragmatism. It will not win a design\naward any time soon \u2013 there are no trendy gradients, bespoke fonts, or elegant\nillustrations. But it has been thoughtfully, intelligently put together.\nEverything has a clear purpose, fulfills a real job, meets a demand. The proof\nis in the numbers.\n\n##\n\n\u201cHow do you scale the cult?\u201d\n\n\u201cI definitely think the first time I heard it, I was a little surprised.\nBecause I\u2019ve actually never heard any entrepreneur just state so boldly that\nthey\u2019re going to become a trillion dollar company.\u201d\n\nIf you were to pick someone who might have heard a CEO make such a daring\nclaim, Jessica Xu would make a good bet. Her former employer, the Softbank\nVision Fund, was notorious for soliciting (and financing) the world\u2019s most\noutrageous, audacious startups, from Uber to DoorDash to Flexport to WeWork.\n\u201c[I had people] trying to pitch very big, but this was another level,\u201d Xu\nsaid.\n\nThe entrepreneur in question was Mike Shebat. Almost as frequently as Shebat\nspeaks about his company\u2019s outspoken work culture, he states with deadpan\ninevitability that Traba will crash the trillion-dollar club. In some sense,\nthis is the yin to Traba\u2019s cultural yang, the carrot that justifies the stick.\nYes, you will give up your nights and weekends, the message seems to be. But\nknow this\u2014we are swinging for nothing less than the moon.\n\nAt the start of my research, this was one of my main questions: How seriously\nshould I take Shebat\u2019s claim that Traba will be a trillion-dollar business? Is\nthis a real possibility or a clever marketing ruse? I wanted to ask this of\nShebat, Buddiga, Traba\u2019s employees, investors, and myself.\n\nBefore evaluating the possibility of Traba reaching a thirteen-figure\nvaluation, let\u2019s assess where the business is today. Traba\u2019s last round, a $22\nmillion Series A-2 led by Founders Fund, valued it at $200 million.\n\nIt was significant for a couple of reasons.\n\nExternally, it functioned as an anointing. Historically, Founders Fund has\nchosen one company in which it has particularly high conviction to kick off a\nnew vintage. Past selections include Facebook, Affirm, Rippling, and Anduril.\nThat the firm chose to launch \u201cFF8\u201d by reinvesting in Traba put it in elite\ncompany and marked it as a breakout. \u201cTraba is our best portfolio company,\u201d\nPeter Thiel said as part of the announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be massive so we\nare tripling-down.\u201d\n\nInternally, it validated Mike Shebat\u2019s fortitude and competitive streak.\nThough he is keen to stress that he and Traba have excellent relations with\nall of their major investors, the Series A briefly tested those bonds. It\nstarted with a nice dinner, during which Founders Fund floated the idea of a\npre-emptive financing round.\n\n\u201cI went to this lavish dinner with Brian Chesky. And Brian was like, \u2018Keith\u2019s\nthe man.\u2019 Then, I was told a valuation like, \u2018If you raise, you could probably\nget to like an $80 million valuation.\u2019 Which I thought was egregious for our\nrevenue at the time. But I agreed with it, then at the last minute they were\nlike \u2018Actually, $50 million.\u2019 I was upset by that because I thought it was a\nwaste of my time as a founder.\u201d\n\nWhy did that happen? \u201cFor a variety of reasons, I abstracted myself [from the\nfundraising process],\u201d Rabois said. \u201cBecause Mike and I are very close, I\ndidn\u2019t want to get in the middle of negotiating the investment \u2013 it\u2019s just a\nfool\u2019s errand. So I deferred to other colleagues at Founders Fund about what\nthe appropriate terms would be.\u201d Founders Fund provided no further comment on\nthe matter.\n\nAround the time Founders Fund revised its offer, Rabois introduced Shebat to\nSamir Kaul, a General Partner at Khosla Ventures. Rabois explained why he\u2019d\nmade the connection to begin with. \u201cI was actually having a board dinner with\nSamir about a different company, OpenStore, and Samir was complaining about\nhow the culture had changed and people generally in their twenties were too\nentitled, they didn\u2019t really want to work. They don\u2019t have dedication, they\u2019re\nall focused on what\u2019s in it for them. As he was explaining his animosity\ntoward a whole generation of people, I said, \u2018You know Samir, I\u2019ve got just\nthe founder for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt proved a savvy match. \u201cI met him at the Setai in Miami, we had breakfast\ntogether,\u201d Shebat recalled. \u201cI could tell he was really knowledgeable, an\nincredible investor. He would definitely look at things from a different angle\nthan the current cap table. So when he gave me an offer, I was like, \u2018This is\na great offer.\u2019\u201d It didn\u2019t hurt that it demonstrated to Founders Fund that if\nthe firm wished to change its terms, Traba had other options available to it.\nThough the Founders Fund encounter ignited Shebat\u2019s strategic thinking and\ncompetitive energy, he emphasizes that it didn\u2019t reduce the esteem with which\nhe held the firm and its partners. Founders Fund participated in Series A, led\nby Khosla Ventures, at a valuation of $120 million.\n\n#### Letters to a Young Founder: Vinod Khosla\n\nMario Gabriele\n\n\u00b7\n\nApr 9\n\nRead full story\n\nWhen it was time to kick off FF8, Founders Fund moved quickly to rectify its\nmistake, albeit at a price. \u201cFounders Fund didn\u2019t have the ownership target\nthey wanted,\u201d Shebat said. \u201cSo they ended up paying $200 million when they\ncould have paid $80 million.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it is a testament to Shebat that he stood fast when it would have\nbeen easier to accept a subpar offer, and it is to Founders Funds\u2019 credit that\nthey recognized their misstep and quickly corrected it.\n\nThe encounter doesn\u2019t seem to have left either side with scars. \u201cMike has\nexcellent investors \u2013 Khosla Ventures and Founders Fund being the most\nimportant and material investors and the most active,\u201d Rabois said. \u201cBoth\nfunds are ecstatic to be working with Traba, with Mike and Akshay.\u201d The bond\nbetween Rabois and Shebat is especially tight, with each of them calling the\nother a close friend.\n\nAs for the Founders Fund team, Shebat holds no ill will. \u201cI personally respect\neverything they represent. They are all brilliant investors, and I consider\nthem close friends. It\u2019s just business. In the same way that they want the\nlowest price, I want the best terms for my employees.\u201d\n\nTraba\u2019s $200 million valuation is impressive for a company yet to reach its\nfourth birthday. Its traction goes some way to explaining that figure. In Q4\n2023, Traba logged $1.73 million in revenue, up 465% year-over-year and 72%\nquarter-over-quarter. That put it on pace to approach $7 million in annualized\nrevenue.\n\nTraba has scaled revenue fast (Traba)\n\nAs Traba has grown, it\u2019s also increased its contribution margin, scaling it\nfrom below 0% to 66% in 18 months. (Because of the methodology Traba uses to\ncalculate this figure, Shebat said its gross margins are actually even\nhigher.) When Jessica Xu first saw these metrics during the recruiting\nprocess, she was stunned. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of marketplaces, given that I\ninvested into a lot of e-commerce businesses back in the day, then also\nrunning a food delivery business where you\u2019re operating a three-sided\nmarketplace. The margins are so thin. There\u2019s really not that much margin\navailable to go around. So when I saw Traba\u2019s margins, I\u2019m like, \u2018Are these\nreal? This is pretty insane, even for a mature company. To see it a Series A\nstartup is a little bit unbelievable.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter joining, Xu quickly learned that the numbers were, indeed, as good as\nthey looked \u2013 and getting better at a rapid clip. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there are\nmore skeletons in the closet. This is a real business model. The money is\nthere.\u201d\n\nMaintaining these margins is critical to Traba\u2019s trillion-dollar quest. The\nmarket cap for large staffing companies like Randstad or Adecco tends to be a\nfraction of their revenue because of their lower profit margins and high\noperational intensiveness. Randstad has a $9.1 billion market cap from $24.4\nbillion in 2023 revenue; Adecco\u2019s market cap is $5.3 billion from $24 billion\nover the same period. If Traba plans to eclipse these businesses by orders of\nmagnitude, it must justify being valued more like a tech company. Naturally,\nits margins are critical in making that case.\n\nThere are other encouraging signs. In addition to adding new customers, Traba\nis increasing the revenue earned from existing buyers. The average customer\ndelivers 5x their initial revenue after a year of using the platform and 10x\nafter two years. This is a sign of a business in rude health, rapidly becoming\na one-stop shop for buyers and growing enough to meet their demand. There is a\nreason why, according to Shebat, his investors from Founders Fund and Khosla\nhave informed him Traba is in the \u201ctop 1%\u201d of Series A companies.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean a $1 trillion valuation is even vaguely in sight, of course.\nA $200 million valuation is impressive for a Series A firm, but it is just\n0.02% of the way to Traba\u2019s ultimate goal.\n\nTo get there, Traba will need to expand upwards and outwards. It is already\nmoving upmarket, seducing enterprise clients like Red Bull, but it represents\na relatively new motion. As Buddiga mentioned, these customers have more\ncomplex requirements and take more time to close. Traba will need to keep\nexpanding its feature set and strengthening its core.\n\nExpanding geographically will be critical to serving big enterprises. So far,\nTraba has pushed into 13 states, with more on the way. It has refined a\nplaybook that seems to be working extremely well \u2013 Rabois noted that new\nmarkets are \u201con par or exceeding previous cohorts.\u201d\n\nIn time, it intends to operate internationally, a challenge that will draw on\nShebat\u2019s experience spinning up Latin American markets at Uber Eats. Winning\nforeign business is far from impossible, but it is also not easy, requiring\ncompliance with different cultural, regulatory, and business norms.\n\nWhile Traba seems intent on winning the world, it also wants to move beyond\nlight industrial staffing into other segments. Businesses like Randstad, for\nexample, offer their services across hospitality, retail, call centers, and\nmany other sectors. There is plenty of road before Traba needs to decide which\nsegment to attack next, but it will have its eyes open to these opportunities.\n\nGiven the product they\u2019ve built to date, there are also clear ancillary\nrevenue streams available. Currently, Traba primarily earns money by placing a\npremium on the workers companies hire \u2013 typically around 37%. If a client\nwants to use Traba\u2019s tech platform and hire from another staffing firm, Traba\napplies approximately a 15% markup on those outside hires.\n\nShebat notes that Traba doesn\u2019t seek to undercut competitors. \u201cWe actually win\nover customers despite not competing on price,\u201d he said. A slide from a recent\nboard deck showed how Traba had gone head-to-head with a competitive firm for\nthree clients. Each time, Traba had won despite charging a higher price. It\nindicates that customers recognize the unique value Traba provides and are\nwilling to pay for it. \u201cIt\u2019s more important for [clients] to complete their\ntasks and get the product out of the facility than to nickel and dime on\nstaffing,\u201d Shebat said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather pay for a superior experience than have\na low fill rate because they were too stingy.\u201d\n\nOver time, Traba may be able to add SaaS and payments revenue to the mix. Its\nbusiness portal is increasingly powerful and offers impressive visibility to\nclients. It\u2019s easy to imagine an enterprise-grade tier that involves a\nreasonable subscription fee, delivering a reliable source of revenue. Because\nTraba is in the flow of funds and has granular information on businesses and\nworkers, it is also positioned to offer financing products and other financial\nservices. These may distract from Traba\u2019s core but are good options.\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge Traba faces as it scales is retaining its\nunique culture. \u201cEvery super intense culture is going to have some micro\nexplosions at some point,\u201d Founders Fund General Partner Trae Stephens said.\n\u201cYou have to control those micro explosions and channel them into further\ngrowth.\u201d\n\nKeith Rabois shared a similar sentiment, referencing a theory from Peter\nThiel\u2019s book Zero To One. In that book, Thiel argues that \u201cThe best startups\nmight be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults.\u201d Traba, with its\nfanatical work ethic and quasi-numinous belief in becoming a $1 trillion\ncompany, fits the bill. \u201cSo, you have a cult,\u201d Rabois said. \u201cThe question is:\nhow do you keep scaling the cult every 10x? Because you have to keep the\ntenets of the cult, you have to have the correct selection. That tends to get\nharder to preserve as the company scales.\u201d\n\nFor now, at least, Rabois isn\u2019t worried. \u201cMike and Akshay \u2013 they\u2019re very\nintentional about what they\u2019re building. They\u2019re constantly thinking about how\nto refine what they do. So it\u2019s not just, \u2018What we did last year we\u2019re going\nto do more of.\u2019 They\u2019re constantly thinking, \u2018How do we evolve the company?\nHow do we evolve our culture? How do we evolve our ambition to hit the next\nset of milestones?\u2019\u201d\n\nWill all of Traba\u2019s big dreams, Olympian work ethic, and varied opportunities\namount to $1 trillion?\n\nThe matter is painted in broad strokes in discussions with leadership,\nemployees, and investors. They refer to the colossal size of the market, the\nextent of its brokenness, the quality of the team, the uniqueness of its\nculture, and the speed of its growth. We discuss the importance of having a\nmountain to climb, a star to chase. Elon Musk tells the world SpaceX will\n\u201cOccupy Mars.\u201d Is this so different? And given the many valuable stops on the\nway, does it matter? SpaceX has yet to touch down on the Red Planet, but a\nrecent secondary sale still valued it at $180 billion. If Traba reaches that\ndizzying height \u2013 or even a fraction of it \u2013 investors and employees will have\nplenty to cheer.\n\nThe vagueness of the trillion-dollar discussion is not a criticism. Given\nTraba\u2019s stage, it would be more concerning if Shebat unveiled a fine-tuned\nmasterplan: add 20% of the staffing market, $50 billion in SaaS revenue, a\ndollop of financial services, a pinch of in-app purchases, and voil\u00e1! A\ntrillion-dollar company. There is such a thing as false precision.\n\nBusinesses of such size are not born that way. They rely on skill, strategy,\nand effort \u2013 but also luck and timing. Jeff Bezos could not have predicted his\nonline bookseller would become a cloud computing giant, nor could Jensen Huang\nknow his graphics chips would be used to power the artificial intelligence\nrevolution. These companies reached their current height by constantly\nadapting, innovating, finding the next great opportunity before their peers.\n\nAbove all, this is what Traba seems to be saying about itself: we are not\nafraid to try. There is a little madness in saying so, a little religion. But\nit is a virtuous madness, hubris laced with honey. By believing it is\npossible, it becomes more so. You aim your sights higher, push harder, settle\nfor less. You work until the offices around you close their doors, until even\nNew York\u2019s coffee shops have shut for the evening, until the elevator requires\na key to operate and the hallway gets a lonely feeling, and you walk out into\nthe late, blue city night.\n\nThe world has no quota for trillion-dollar businesses. More can and will be\nmade. And it is no crime to believe you can build one.\n\nThe Generalist\u2019s work is provided for informational purposes only and should\nnot be construed as legal, business, investment, or tax advice.
