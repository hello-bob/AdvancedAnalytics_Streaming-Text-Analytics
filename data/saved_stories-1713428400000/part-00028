However, Dr Singh said producing\ngraphite to be used in these batteries can be polluting, requiring harsh\nchemicals, such as Hydrofluoric acid (HF).\n\n\u201cOne eco-friendly, carbon-rich source that is abundant and readily available\neverywhere is human hair,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly clean source right through the entire process with very\nminimal pollutants or negative outputs.\u201d\n\nSustainable Salons, a for-purpose organisation dedicated to diverting salon\nwaste from landfill, collects hair clippings from salons and pet groomers\nacross Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSince 2020, Sustainable Salons Co-Founder Mr Paul Frasca has been supplying\nhair clippings for Dr Singh to conduct his research.\n\n\u201cWe envision a future where hair transcends its conventional status as waste\nand emerges as a sustainable resource of immense potential,\u201d Mr Frasca said.\n\n\u201cWhat sets hair apart is that it is an infinite resource - hair is constantly\ngrowing!\n\n\u201cThe prospect of harnessing hair to power our electric vehicles demonstrates\nthat a sustainable future is limitless when we embrace the circular economy.\u201d\n\nUsing human hair as a form of sustainable energy has already been proven\neffective in Dr Singh\u2019s prior research, where it was transformed into hair-\nderived carbon dots.\n\n\u201cWe have essentially been able to fabricate flexible light-emitting diodes\n(LEDs), which are used in so many technological products today, but instead of\nheavy metals the active material is ingeniously derived from discarded strands\nof human hair,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis could totally revolutionise how we achieve emission reduction goals in\nthe future.\u201d\n\nFurther information on the research can be found here.\n\nENDS\n\n##### Media Note:\n\nFor more information or to arrange an interview with Dr Amandeep Singh Pannu,\ncontact Trease Clarke at Charles Sturt Media on mobile 0409 741 789 or via\nnews@csu.edu.au\n\nPhoto caption:\n\nDr Amandeep Singh Pannu, Research Fellow in the Charles Sturt University Rural\nHealth and Research Institute in front of a tube furnace.\n\n###\n\nShare this article\n\nshare\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nEmail\n\nShare\n\nPrint\n\nlocal_offer All Local News Charles Sturt University Rural and Regional Health\nResearch Institute Science Society and Community Sustainability\n\n### More Latest news articles\n\nLATEST NEWS 17 Apr 2024\n\nshare\n\n#### Endangered species could be saved by linking water management and bittern\nbreeding activities\n\nlocal_offer Charles Sturt University Gulbali Institute Research\n\nLATEST NEWS 16 Apr 2024\n\nshare\n\n#### Time to celebrate!
