I think it\u2019s more beautiful than\nmany other places in the world.\n\nIt definitely has beautiful parts. From a geographical stand point the USA is\nunambiguously one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Consider the\nRockies in Colorado, the Badlands of South Dakota, the dense Everglades in\nFlorida. Venture through the Mojave in Arizona, the vast Great Lakes, or\nescape entirely to California, Alaska, Hawaii. The coasts touch both the\nPacific and Atlantic, offering endless vistas.\n\nEven the often-overlooked Ohio and Kentucky have understated charm. Driving\nNebraska's great plains remains one of my most vivid experiences. And then\nthere's the iconic American landscapes: the Smokies, Grand Canyon, Yosemite,\nDeath Valley, Niagara Falls, the Bayou.\n\nBut southern Utah? It may be my personal favorite. Stretching down to the\nnorthern rim of the Grand Canyon, it's possibly the pinnacle of American\nbeauty.\n\nBut generally, too much of America is marred by strip malls, parking lots, and\nareas designed for driving through than for enjoying.\n\n### What Makes America Ugly?\n\nWe've abandoned beauty and now prioritize for efficiency and\nfunctionality\u2014areas where America dominates. You can buy anything, anywhere,\nanytime. It\u2019s a trade-off. Beauty for convenience.\n\n> The entire distance of I-35 between Austin and San Antonio is one,\n> uninterrupted string of every drive thru or fast casual chain imaginable.\n>\n> Made me want to take a road trip with @NNNIncome where he just points out\n> everything that stands out to him along the way.\n>\n> \u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) Mar 18, 2024\n\n1) Consider the Strip Mall\n\nThe quintessential American architectural experience for many on a daily\nbasis. In American culture, the strip mall often draws derision, epitomizing\nthe tacky postwar suburbia and the disposable culture it fostered. Often\nlabeled as ugly and tacky, strip malls lack charm, elegance, or distinctive\narchitectural features. They stand as generic, expendable backdrops.\n\n2) New Urban Condos Look the Same\n\nMany American cities hold beauty, but that's a legacy from times past when\npublic aesthetics mattered. Today, new constructions are visually unappealing\nand graceless, with a sameness that erases any local architectural identity.\n\n3) America is Filled with Stroads\n\nStroads merge the worst features of streets and roads, resulting in a\nconfused, identity-lacking design. They aim to accommodate both fast traffic\nand local access, failing to excel at either. The lack of cohesive design not\nonly makes them functionally problematic but also visually unappealing.\n\n4) America is an Inside Culture\n\nOne of America's issues is its indoor-centric lifestyle \u2014 people spend their\ntime inside homes, cars, offices, or malls. In contrast, Japan emphasizes\nliving outdoors, with public spaces designed to offer both adventure and\ncomfort.\n\nMost Americans are an inside people. Not outside.\n\n> The purpose of the American life is to have a nice house with cool stuff in\n> it. That's it. The more you revolt against this, the more miserable you will\n> be.\n>\n> \u2014 ev (@_evFM) Apr 6, 2024\n\nThis means public spaces aren't valued for beauty\u2014we simply overlook them. In\ncontrast, our homes shine; we're obsessed with updating kitchens, constantly\nenhancing our private sanctuaries.\n\n> The kitchen flex is unmistakenly part of American culture. Once you see it\n> you can't unsee it\n>\n> \u2014 LindyMan (@PaulSkallas) Mar 8, 2024\n\n### There is Hope\n\nBut a recent video inspired me: we don't have to give up. We can work to\nrestore America's beauty, and it won't cost trillions to do it.\n\n> TIL that marble bust at Stripe Sessions was made @Monumental_Labs, which\n> builds \"AI-enabled robotic stone carving factories to unleash a renaissance\"\n>\n> Pricing is 85% less than hand-carved: Life-sized bust: $6k Life-sized\n> figure: $32k Monumental Figure: $95k\n>\n> \u2014 Sheel Mohnot (@pitdesi) Apr 25, 2024\n\nWe've stopped beautifying highways, strip malls, and the spaces in between\nwhere we travel. I believe this is a mistake. We spend considerable time in\npublic and shouldn't just view it as time to \"get somewhere else.\"\n\nThere are affordable methods to enhance the beauty of our public spaces now.\nWe won't recreate the splendid cities of yesteryear, nor will we dismantle the\nUS highway system or demolish the suburbs.\n\nInstead, we must integrate beauty into our current surroundings. Fortunately,\ntechnology is on our side to aid in this transformation.\n\n### In This Newsletter\n\n1) Put Beautiful Sculptures Everywhere: Place captivating sculptures in strip\nmalls, parking lots, and other under-decorated areas to enhance their\naesthetic appeal.\n\n2) The Case for Returning Street Lights to an Orange Color. Modern LED\nstreetlights emit a harsh white light, robbing the night of its enchantment.\nAdvocates for visual elegance are pushing to return street lights to the cozy,\namber radiance of traditional bulbs, aiming to recapture an inviting and\nvisually appealing ambiance.\n\n3) Vertical Gardens and Green Walls: Use vertical gardens as barriers and\nnoise reducers along highways. These gardens not only cut down on pollutants\nand noise but also transform bland stretches of road into vibrant green\nspaces.\n\n### Put Beautiful Sculptures Everywhere\n\n## Subscribe to Premium Membership to read the rest.\n\nBecome a paying subscriber of Premium Membership to get access to this post\nand other subscriber-only content.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready a paying subscriber?
