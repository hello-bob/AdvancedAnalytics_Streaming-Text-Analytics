In this\ncontext, this paper proposes to equip vibrating assets like machinery with\npiezoelectric sensors, used to set up energy self-sufficient sensing platforms\nfor hard-to-reach positions. Preliminary measurements as well as extended\nlaboratory tests are proposed to understand the behavior of commercial\npiezoelectric sensors when employed as energy harvesters. First, a general\narchitecture for a vibration-powered LoRaWAN-based sensor node is proposed.\nFinal tests are then performed to identify an ideal trade-off between sensor\nsampling rates and energy availability. The target is to ensure continuous\noperation of the device while guaranteeing a charging trend of the storage\ncomponent connected to the system. In this context, an Ultra-Low-Power Energy-\nHarvesting Integrated Circuit plays a crucial role by ensuring the correct\nregulation of the output with very high efficiency.\n\nKeywords:\n\nenergy harvesting; piezoelectric; vibration; Industrial Internet of Things;\nLoRaWAN\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nThe rapid growth of wireless sensing technologies in the Internet of Things\n(IoT) domain has made energy consumption a critical challenge. Many Wireless\nSensor Nodes (WSNs) still rely on batteries, which require constant human\nintervention, increasing costs and limiting the scalability of many\napplications. To overcome this challenge, energy harvesting offers a promising\nsolution by eliminating the need for frequent battery replacements, which\nreduces maintenance costs and improves the scalability of WSN deployments.\nThis approach involves new technologies capable of scavenging small amounts of\nenergy from various environmental phenomena, bringing the research closer to\nthe world of renewable energies. One of the most significant advantages of\nthis method is the ability to power electronic devices without relying on\ntraditional sources like batteries or electrical outlets. This eliminates the\nneed for constant human intervention, significantly expanding the potential\napplication areas for these devices.\n\nDue to the continuous growth of technologies in this field, new devices now\noffer the possibility to harvest energy from an increasingly wider range of\nsources, allowing for further scaling application scenarios of WSNs. This\npaper focuses on piezoelectric energy harvesting, which utilizes piezoelectric\nmaterials to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. These robust\nand durable devices can generate electric charge from various sources,\nincluding vibrations in footsteps, buildings (like bridges), or industrial\nmachinery, making them suitable for harsh environments. Overall, piezoelectric\nenergy harvesting is a promising technology within the IoT domain and in\nindustrial automation in particular: it can be employed for Industrial\nInternet of Things (IIoT) devices and may be used to power remote sensors by\nscavenging energy from industrial vibrations.\n\nIn this context, the aim of this study is to demonstrate the usability of low-\ncost off-the-shelf piezoelectric sensors as energy harvesters for ultra-low-\npower sensing applications. The industrial context proves to be ideal since in\nthis scenario many vibration sources can be found, but the results presented\nin this paper are thought to be as general as possible, and thus also\nexploitable for applications to be deployed in other contexts any time there\nis the presence of vibrating items.\n\nIn the proposed experimental setup, piezoelectric transducers are combined\nwith a dedicated power management integrated circuit (IC) to guarantee the\nenergy independence of a generic low-power IoT application. In order to keep\nthe outputs of the tests independent of the specific applications, only the\ncore elements of a generic IoT node are integrated into the experimental\nsetup, assuming that data transmission is in general the most power-hungry\nactivity. Indeed, demonstrating the successful functionality of a generic low-\npower sensor node serves to illustrate the versatility of piezoelectric\nsensors across various application contexts.\n\nSimilar to numerous other distributed IoT systems, transmission is achieved by\nusing the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology. The LoRaWAN\nprotocol, which utilizes Long Range (LoRa) modulation, overcomes two critical\nrequirements for IoT sensor nodes: minimal power usage and wide communication\nrange. Consequently, it stands out as one of the most suitable\ntelecommunication technologies among the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks\n(LPWANs).\n\nIn this context, this paper aims to investigate the possibility of using\npiezoelectric sensors for powering an ultra-low-power IoT node. The final goal\nis to define suitable conditions by establishing a proper balance between the\ndata acquisition and transmission frequency and the charging capacity of the\nstorage component integrated into the system. The rest of this paper is\norganized as follows: Section 2 explores related studies, whereas Section 3\nelaborates on the system\u2019s architecture. Section 4 examines the power\nconsumption of the device. Laboratory tests are presented and discussed in\nSection 5 and Section 6, whereas Section 7 presents the conclusions.\n\n## 2\\. Related Works\n\nIn recent years, energy harvesting has assumed a fundamental role in\naddressing the continuous growth of low-power applications [1]. A wide variety\nof alternative sources have been explored and adapted to supply many systems,\nenabling the deployment of new IoT nodes in increasingly remote scenarios [2].\n\nCurrently, harvesting energy from physical phenomena is a well-established\ntechnology, with many power sources such as heat, solar energy, or even wave\nmotion extensively characterized. For example, authors in [3,4] provide\ndetailed characterizations of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and their\nutilization in highly energy-demanding IIoT applications. Their work\ndemonstrates that, in the presence of a reliable heat source, these devices\nare capable of fully supporting a consuming application. Other authors, such\nas Olzhabay et al. [5], have described an indoor IoT sensor node based on\nperovskite solar cells, demonstrating their ability to power low-power\napplications even under conditions of very low irradiance. Bruzzi et al. [6]\nhave investigated a typical LoRaWAN-based sensor node powered by dye-\nsensitized solar cells (DSSCs) under challenging conditions, showcasing the\ncapacity of these devices to adequately supply power to the system even on\ncloudy days.\n\nIn addition to the advancements in IoT sensor nodes powered by well-known\nenergy sources, there has been significant progress in the field of vibration\nenergy harvesting. Vibrations are indeed common in many environments, such as\nin buildings, bridges, vehicles, and machines, and can be caused by various\nsources, such as traffic, wind, and the operation of machinery. Vibration\nenergy-harvesting technology uses piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and\nelectrostatic transducers or triboelectric nanogenerators to convert the\nmechanical energy of the vibrations into electrical energy. Electromagnetic\nvibration energy harvesters (EMEHs) [7] operate based on Lenz and Faraday\u2019s\nlaws, exploiting magnetic induction. By connecting a magnet to the vibrating\nsource and allowing it to move within a coil, a current is generated\nproportionally to the variation in the concatenated flux of the magnetic field\nwith the surface of the coil. Electrostatic vibration energy harvesters\n(ESEHs) [8,9] convert mechanical energy into electrical energy by exploiting\nthe movement of electrons between the charged plates of a capacitor. One\nplate, connected to the vibrating source, induces relative motion with the\nother plate, causing a variation in total capacitance and leading to the\ngeneration of a static current. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) [10] rely\non the triboelectric effect, which involves the generation of an electric\ncharge when two dissimilar materials come into contact and then separate.\nTENGs exploit this effect by using materials with different triboelectric\nproperties to generate electric charges through repeated contact and\nseparation, typically induced by mechanical motion. TENGs can harvest energy\nfrom a variety of mechanical sources, including friction, vibration, and\nmotion.\n\nPiezoelectric harvesters (PEHs), as seen before, exploit the piezoelectric\neffect, which can be direct or inverse [11,12]. The direct one refers to the\npossibility to generate electric charges from mechanical stress or pressure,\nwhereas the inverse one describes the ability of these materials to convert\nelectrical energy into a mechanical one. The former is the one we are\nanalyzing in this paper, whereas the latter is mostly used to generate sound\nwaves (such as in buzzers and speakers). PEHs have been used in a variety of\napplications, like, for instance in [13], where the purpose was to power a\nwearable device exploiting upper limb movements. Furthermore, other parts of\nthe body have been studied and proven efficient for these types of\napplications. As Shenck and Paradiso performed in [14], using specific\npiezoelectric materials to build shoes\u2019 insoles, they were able to activate\nwhile walking with an RF tag, which transmitted a short-range wireless\nidentification code. Indeed, as suggested in [15], a 68 kg man can indeed\ngenerate about 67 W by simply walking at a speed of two steps per second.\nRemaining in human body-related applications [16], medical devices like\npacemakers have been integrated with flexible piezoelectric materials to\nextend their life.\n\nA different application field is, for instance, the monitoring of buildings\nand infrastructures, like in [17], where the study was based on the generation\nof energy by applying piezoelectric material under a bridge, considering that\nwhen a car passes, a strain on the bridge is caused. Or again, Ref. [18]\ndemonstrated the possibility of harvesting low-frequency vibrations obtained\nfrom the vehicles passing over speed bumps, and Ref. [19] analyzed a road\nenergy harvester that could extract power from a roadway. A notable recent\napplication is presented in the work by Dziadak et al. [20]. The authors\ndeveloped a power supply system for a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) node\ndesigned for monitoring the temperature of axle boxes and bearings in railroad\nwagons. To tackle the challenge of operating in harsh environments with\nlimited power sources, they designed a piezoelectric energy harvester\ncomprising three piezoelectric elements placed on a double-arm pendulum beam.\nTheir research demonstrated the efficacy of a compact pendulum harvester,\nshowcasing its ability to significantly extend the operational lifespan of the\nmeasurement node, even at low vibration frequencies. The literature, as\nreferenced in [21], illustrates the different range of piezoelectric materials\navailable and their mounting structures, highlighting the remarkable\nadaptability of these devices to various environments. Recent studies, such as\n[22], have explored the utilization of piezoelectric devices in wind energy\nharvesting, showcasing their versatility and potential applications in\nrenewable energy generation. These research efforts evaluate the key factors\ninfluencing the performance of energy-harvesting systems and provide valuable\nrecommendations for further optimization. The focus of the article is to\nhighlight modeling techniques for Piezoelectric Wind Energy Harvesters\n(PWEHs), analyzing their structural functionality and assessing their efficacy\nin harnessing wind energy through phenomena such as vortex-induced vibration,\nflutter, and galloping. Additionally, this paper offers insights into future\ntrends in PWEH development and discusses recent advancements in wind energy-\nharvesting strategies utilizing piezoelectric materials. It analyzes various\npiezoelectric materials addressing existing challenges in wind energy\nharvesting, outlines potential routes for future development, and provides\nrecommendations for further research in this field.\n\nThe literature extensively covers various contributions in the field of\npiezoelectric energy harvesting. However, this paper introduces a more\nstraightforward and potentially cost-effective method for energy harvesting\ncompared to the systems typically discussed, such as the one outlined in [23];\nwhereas Ref. [23] utilizes a complex bimorph configuration with PZT material,\nthis work focuses on readily available, single-layer PVDF sensors (LDT0-028K\nfrom TE connectivity), making the design more practical and potentially more\naffordable. The aim of this paper is to advance existing piezoelectric energy\nharvesters by showcasing the feasibility of utilizing sensor-purposed\npiezoelectric transducers, not traditionally considered energy generators, for\nenergy-harvesting purposes. This novel approach enables the development of\nsmaller energy harvesters compared to conventional ones, addressing the\nincreasingly stringent limitations in size and cost for WSN applications. To\nfurther dive into the components employed in our design and the measuring\nsetup, the subsequent section proposes a general overview of the system\narchitecture.\n\n## 3\\. System Architecture\n\nThis section provides a detailed analysis of the system architecture,\noutlining the functionalities of each component and their interconnections.\nThe entire system architecture is outlined in the schematic diagram reported\nin Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. System architecture\u2019s block scheme. The figure represents both the\nfront and side views of the mounting setup. The signal generator outputs a 50\nHz, 1 V_pp sinusoidal waveform, which, after the amplification stage, reaches\nthe body shaker. The latter generates a vibration that excites the\npiezoelectric sensor. Its harvested energy is processed and stored in\ncapacitors. This allows to power the WSN.\n\n#### 3.1. Vibrating Source and Harvesting-Related Architecture\n\nThe system initiates with the generation of a controlled vibration using a\nsignal generator, which produces a precisely defined sine wave. This waveform\nis subsequently transmitted to a dedicated amplifier for signal amplification.\nThe chosen amplifier model is the Nobsound TPA3116D2 based on the TPA31xxD2\nseries from Linear technology [24]. The amplified signal then drives the\nRockwood BS301-L body shaker, which is mounted on the underside of a wooden\ntable. Piezoelectric sensors, positioned on the top surface of the table in\nclose proximity to the vibration source, are responsible for converting the\nphysical vibrations into electrical energy. The chosen model for these sensors\nis the LDTM-028K [25]. This placement minimizes the potential for frequency\nalterations during vibration transmission through the wood. The central\nsection of the table is designed to allow for free vibration, whereas the\ncorners remain fixed to ensure stability and prevent unwanted resonances.\nAdhesive tape secures the piezoelectric sensors to the tabletop. Finally, the\nsensors are connected in parallel, and their combined electrical output,\nrepresenting the harvested energy, is directed towards the energy harvester\nfor further processing. Although a cantilever beam structure for energy\nharvesting is usually quite demanding in terms of needed space, the used\ntransducers have very small dimensions, being 13 mm \u00d7 25 mm. In the system\nproposed in this paper, as a result of a trade-off between the generated power\nand the occupied volume (which could be important in a remote sensing node),\nfive sensors have been mounted over the wooden table as better highlighted in\nFigure 2. The complete subsystem is shown in Figure 3, highlighting the shaker\nand piezoelectric sensors.\n\nFigure 2. Top view of the vibrating plane with 5 piezoelectric transducers\nmounted. As better highlighted here, the vibrating region is the middle one,\nwhereas the sides are fixed to the table supports.\n\nFigure 3. Complete setup: vibrating subsystem, signal generation and\namplification subsystem, harvester and storage capacitor, end device with\nultrasonic sensor embedded.\n\nThe outputs of the piezoelectric sensors, which generate sinusoidal signals at\nthe same frequency as the vibration signal, are connected to the PZ1 and PZ2\ninputs of the energy harvester. The energy harvester is a pre-built board that\nincorporates the Analog Devices chip LTC 3588-1 [26]. This component proves\nideal for extracting energy from sources such as vibrations (piezoelectric) or\nAC power. It transforms incoming AC signals into DC for storage, regulates the\noutput voltage to a selectable level, and employs a nanopower, highly\nefficient synchronous buck regulator. The harvester\u2019s input stage incorporates\nan internal full bridge rectifier, generating a DC voltage that charges the\nstorage capacitor connected to the pin. This DC voltage is internally clamped\nat 20 V and controls the UVLO (Under Voltage Lock Out) section, which\ndetermines when the buck should be enabled or disabled.\n\nA noteworthy feature of the harvester is the use of a hysteretic voltage\nalgorithm to regulate the output, utilizing internal feedback from the sense\npin. In this process, the output capacitor is charged beyond the desired\nregulated voltage through the inductor connected to pin , as depicted in\nFigure 4. The PMOS switch is turned on during this charging phase, enabling a\ngradual current increase up to 260 mA (dependent on input voltage, output\nvoltage, and inductor value). Once the voltage slightly exceeds the regulation\npoint, the PMOS switch is turned off. Under load current, the output capacitor\ndischarges until the voltage falls below the regulation point. At this point,\nthe regulator activates, and the NMOS switch is turned on, facilitating energy\nflow from the inductor to the output capacitor to maintain the desired output\nvoltage. This cycle efficiently repeats during light loads due to minimal\nlosses associated with hysteretic control.\n\nFigure 4. Internal schematic of the proposed harvester [26]. Numbers\ncorrespond to the ports of the components according to its physical layout.\n\nDuring periods of inactivity in regulation (i.e., when the output capacitor\nsupplies the load current), the buck converter enters a sleep state tracked by\na sleep comparator. In sleep mode, the NMOS switch remains on even when the\ninductor current reaches zero, preventing unnecessary losses that would occur\nif the current freewheeled through the body diode of the NMOS. One of the most\nimportant components is the storage element to be used in conjunction with the\nharvester. On the input side of the IC, we have connected a large capacitor\nbetween VIN and GND to store excess energy generated by the piezoelectric\nsensors. Due to the specific characteristics of this harvester, it is not\nfeasible to use a standard rechargeable battery. The circuit has a hysteresis\nthreshold that requires the input voltage to exceed before regulating the\nconnected load. This voltage threshold is not compatible with a standard 3.7 V\nLi-Po battery and prevents the rapid discharge of the storage component by\ndelaying the regulation of the output until sufficient energy has accumulated\non the input side.\n\nConsidering the overall system efficiency, although the buck converter\nconsumes more power during active switching, this duration is very short\ncompared to the sleep time when harvesting energy. This design proves ideal\nfor applications like the one in this paper, where the energy source provides\nsmall amounts of power.\n\n#### 3.2. Wireless Sensor Node\u2019s Architecture\n\nThe harvester\u2019s generated power serves as the energy source for the IoT node.\nThe sensor node comprises two primary components: a Microcontroller Unit (MCU)\nand a LoRaWAN module. A basic LoRaWAN network is established between the end\nnode and a private gateway positioned a short distance from the measurement\nlocation. The design incorporates an RFM95 LoRaWAN transceiver from HopeRF\n[27], facilitating transmissions at very low power levels. To manage the\nLoRaWAN module, an ATTiny84 MCU was selected due to its advantageous balance\nbetween simplicity, power consumption, and performance. In this application,\nno specific sensors were integrated into the system, assuming that the\nperiodic transmission bursts dominate the overall power consumption. However,\nthis concept will be further analyzed in subsequent sections, where an HC-SR04\nultrasonic sensor will be integrated into the system to demonstrate the\nversatility of the application when utilizing standard, low-energy-demanding\nsensors.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the output voltage of the harvester can be adjusted to\nmeet specific requirements. Despite the fact that both the MCU and the LoRaWAN\ntransceiver can operate with a supply voltage of 1.8 V, we have set the output\nvoltage to 3.3 V in our setup. This ensures compatibility with the MCU,\nLoRaWAN module, and a wide range of sensors available in the market. This\nvoltage level is regulated by the buck converter inside the harvester, which\nmaintains the output voltage at 3.3 V once sufficient energy is stored in the\ninput capacitor. It is important to note that this regulation is independent\nof the voltage across the piezoelectric transducers\u2019 electrodes. The voltage\nacross the electrodes affects only the amount of energy harvested from the\nenvironment and, consequently, the charging speed of the input capacitor, but\nnot the output regulation level. Theoretical analyses subsequently assume a\nstandard voltage of 3.3 V as a result. The complete setup, including the\nmeasuring subsystem, is reported in Figure 3. In the next section, these\ntheoretical aspects will be used to further analyze the power consumption of\nthe components present in the design.\n\n## 4\\. Power Consumption Analysis\n\nSimilar to many other low-power applications, the operation of the device has\nbeen divided into two main phases: an active phase where the system queries\nthe sensors to collect new data and transmit them, and a power-down phase\nduring which harvested energy is stored in the input capacitor to support\nsubsequent transmission bursts. Ensuring the proper functioning of the device\nrequires a careful analysis of both phases, as this enables optimization of\nboth firmware and hardware, resulting in optimal performance in terms of\nmaximum transmission rate. To do so, by using a 6.5-digit Keysight\nTechnologies (Santa Rosa, CA, USA) 34461a Digital Multimeter and a Keysight\nTechnologies DSOX3024T oscilloscope, we tested the current drawn by all the\ncomponents during both the operating modes of the device. The results are\nsummarized in Table 1, which presents the currents drawn during both the\noperating modes and the active time of each component.\n\nTable 1. Current consumption and active time for all the system components.\n\nThe results clearly highlight that the transmission burst represents the main\ncontribution to the power consumption during the device\u2019s active phase. This\npaper\u2019s objective is indeed to demonstrate the operational capability of a\nversatile IoT application integrating standard sensors. In this setup, the\npower consumption of these sensors remains relatively low compared to the peak\nenergy demand observed during a transmission burst. It is important to notice\nthat whereas our focus is on scenarios with low-power sensors, similar\nbehavior can be expected in applications requiring high-energy-demanding\nsensors. However, analyzing power consumption in such instances necessitates\naccounting for these distinct factors.\n\nLaboratory tests were carried out with a spreading factor (SF) of 7 and a\nbandwidth (BW) of 125 kHz. These settings enabled transmissions with data\nlengths ranging from 1 to 6 bytes to be completed in approximately 50 ms.\nAdditionally, to effectively manage power consumption, the transmission power\nof the LoRaWAN transceiver was set to 2 dB. This level is typically adequate\nto cover distances of a few hundred meters that are well aligned with many\nindustrial environments. By using these configurations, significant reductions\nin device power consumption were achieved, thereby facilitating the charging\nof the capacitor integrated into the system.\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the operational cycle of the device in a scenario where\nno sensors were integrated. As depicted, the operation alternates between two\ndistinct modes: a power-down mode, where energy consumption is minimized to\nfacilitate the charging process of the storage capacitor, and an active phase\nwhere both the MCU and LoRaWAN module turn on to execute a transmission.\nDuring the active phase, the device undergoes a sequence of events. Initially,\nthere is a phase lasting approximately 20 ms where only the MCU operates at\nvery low power consumption to initialize the transceiver. Subsequently, a peak\ncurrent of 40 mA is observed, lasting almost 50 ms, signaling the completion\nof the transmission burst. Conversely, in the sleep mode, both the MCU and\nLoRaWAN module transition into a power-down routine, significantly reducing\nconsumption to just a few hundred nanoamperes.\n\nFigure 5. System power consumption during the active phase when no sensors are\nemployed.\n\nAlthough the nanopower buck converter\u2019s datasheet indicates minimal parasitic\nterms, it is worth briefly discussing these factors more in detail. The\nresults from testing the nanopower buck converter are presented in the second\nrow of Table 1. Here, the measured current reflects residual parasitic terms\nwithin the converter, requiring, in any case, careful examination as even\nminor currents could significantly impact the available energy. Indeed, during\nthe piezoelectric vibration, we observed a current flow ranging from 10 to 14\ninto the input capacitor. According to the datasheet, the ultra-low quiescent\ncurrent undervoltage lockout (UVLO) feature sets the harvester in two\noperating modes. When low energy levels are detected at the input, the buck\nconverter shuts off, resulting in a loss of load regulation and draw.\nConversely, if the input voltage exceeds the threshold, the buck converter\nregulates the output voltage to the programmed level, activating the load. In\nthis scenario, under open load conditions, a parasitic term of approximately\nis drawn from the output capacitor. During the active phase, the converter\u2019s\nefficiency also plays a role, although this aspect will be further explored in\nthe subsequent section. For what concerns the parasitics of the harvester, we\nconsidered the current draw to be given that in an ideal scenario the output\nnever loses the regulation state during both the active and sleep mode of the\ndevice.\n\nThe second test campaign was conducted by integrating an HC-SR04 ultrasonic\nsensor into the system to assess the impact of a relatively power-hungry\nsensor on device power consumption. The last row of Table 1 reports the\ncorresponding values tested for this sensor. To meet the sensor\u2019s voltage\nrequirement of 4 V to properly operate, a 5 V DC-DC step-up converter was\nadded to the system. However, this setup served as an additional way to\ndemonstrate the device\u2019s adaptability under more demanding conditions induced\nby the increased energy consumption of the step-up converter. During the\nactive phase, the sensor exhibited an average current of , with a peak\nreaching during the measuring phase. An additional BJT transistor was used to\nmanage the sensor\u2019s activation and deactivation, effectively minimizing its\npower consumption to negligible levels during sleep mode. A sample of the\nactivation of the device is depicted in Figure 6. Here, only the sensor\u2019s\nactivation is superimposed on the previous trace, as the transmission burst\nremained almost identical regardless of whether the sensor was present. The\nsample shows that even with the integration of a standard sensor into the\nsystem, the transmission burst continues to dominate the energy consumption of\nthe device, as evidenced by the integral of the previous plot, and whereas the\ninclusion of a sensor may marginally reduce the capacitor\u2019s charging speed,\nthe overall performance remains consistent in a general context. Consequently,\nsubsequent tests are conducted with the sensor excluded from the system,\nthereby maintaining a more comprehensive overview of the application. This\napproach ensures adaptability to various environments and working conditions.\nThanks to these achievements, further testing was possible. In particular, the\nfollowing paragraphs report few considerations about the piezoelectric devices\nused here, a set of sizing equations and laboratory results performed to test\nthe operation of the system.\n\nFigure 6. System power consumption during the active phase when an ultrasonic\nsensor is included in the system.\n\n## 5\\. System Tests\n\n#### 5.1. Piezo Mounting Considerations\n\nThis paper investigates the potential of the LDTM-028K piezoelectric\ntransducer (TE Connectivity) for energy-harvesting applications. It is\ntypically used as a sensor for triggering circuits or for acceleration\nmeasurement. The datasheet suggests the transducer may be better suited for\ndetecting impacts, static pressure changes, or vibrations rather than energy\nconversion. However, this research explores its potential in the latter\napplication. For optimal performance, mounting considerations need to be\nconducted. The resonant frequency of the transducer is indeed highly dependent\non the applied tip mass and on the \u201cfree\u201d length after the clamped section.\nThe chosen model incorporates a 0.72 g tip mass to adapt the sensor to lower\nfrequencies.\n\nThe datasheet lacks information on the relationship between the \u201cfree\u201d length\nand the resonant frequency of this transducer, which is therefore derived in\nhere through the FEA (Finite Element Analysis) software ANSYS Student 2024 R1.\nIn this way, it is shown how, through simple mounting considerations, these\nsensors can adapt to broad frequency ranges and how, in every condition, they\nare able to generate the necessary energy to power the considered IoT node. A\n3D model of the piezoelectric transducer was first created in Solidworks using\ninformation from the datasheet. Unluckily, the manufacturer has chosen not to\ndisclose certain specifications, such as thicknesses and material properties,\nin the datasheet. Consequently, the model was constructed using the given\nknowledge and has undergone multiple revisions to achieve the closest possible\nresemblance to the actual sensor. The final structure is reported in Figure 7\nalong with Table 2, which describes the mechanical parameters of each one of\nthe component\u2019s materials.\n\nFigure 7. Piezoelectric transducer (LDTM-028K) layers stack.\n\nTable 2. Piezoelectric sensor\u2019s materials and their main mechanical\nparameters.\n\nSince the 3D model, as previously mentioned, does not fully correspond to the\nreal structure because of the missing details, there was the need to validate\nit through a simulation. This simulation compared the resonant frequency of\nthe first mode with the commercially available version of the transducer from\nTE Connectivity LDT0-028K (without tip mass) for which the resonant frequency\ndependence on \u201cfree\u201d length is provided.\n\nThe ANSYS model comprises a stack of various solid elements. Starting from the\nbase, there is a coating material that extends onto the sides of the bottom\nelectrode, effectively incorporating the electrode within the external\ncoating. Next is the PVDF material layer, upon which the top electrode is\nprinted. Surrounding all the sides and the top of the top electrode layer is a\n5 mil Mylar layer. The exploded view of this structure (with tip masses\nomitted for image clarity) is depicted in Figure 7. Each layer is connected to\nits nearest layers through a bounded connection type. To mesh the structure, a\nbody sizing of 0.35 mm has been selected specifically for this material\u2019s\nstack. The mesh density can be seen in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8. First mode shape of the LDTM-028K piezoelectric transducer (maximum\nand minimum displacements are shown respectively in red and blue).\n\nThe results showed good agreement, with the resonant frequency starting at f =\n180 Hz for the maximum \u201cfree\u201d length (20 mm) and increasing exponentially\ntowards higher frequencies. There was a slight discrepancy at high\nfrequencies, where even minor model variations could lead to significant\nerrors. This is likely due to the lack of detailed information about material\nproperties, thicknesses, and their specific characteristics in the datasheet.\nHowever, the validation process proved beneficial. It allowed for the\nsubsequent simulation of the device with the added tip mass. Both the\nsimulation results are shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9. Simulated relation between resonant frequency and \u201cfree\u201d length for\nthe Piezoelectric transducers. The blue trace reports results when no tip mass\nis used, whereas the red trace represents the case in which 0.72 g mass is\napplied.\n\nAs expected from the datasheet, the resonant frequency for around 0.7 g tip\nmasses is about 40 Hz. Reducing the \u201cfree\u201d length of the cantilever beam\nstructure, the resonant frequency increases. For the application of this paper\n(i.e., sinewave at 50 Hz), the best mounting configuration can be expected to\nhave a \u201cfree\u201d length of around mm. Figure 8 shows an ANSYS environment image,\ndetailing how the first mode shape appears for the chosen cantilever beam\nstructure.\n\nFrom a mathematical perspective, the same results can be derived according to\nthe Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam theory. Indeed, referring to the equations that rule\nfree vibrations, it is possible to derive analytically the modal frequencies\nof a cantilever beam. Of course, it is necessary to impose the boundary\nconditions (i.e., where it is fixed and where it is free) and then solve the\nresulting equation. It is important to derive the second moment of inertia (or\narea moment of inertia) of the cantilever with respect to its neutral axis and\nto know its elastic modulus. Since in this paper there is a stack of materials\nwith different moments of inertia and different elastic moduli, the structure\nhas been approximated as a rectangular parallelepiped with a thickness\nequalling the sum of all the thicknesses of the layers, which is equal to m.\nMoreover, the elastic modulus was considered equal to GPa, which is slightly\nlower than that of the highest stack to also consider the less rigid\nlayers.The equation that determines the displacement for each mode for a beam\nwithout tip mass is as follows:\n\nThe value of , where n refers to the nth mode, is given as follows:\n\nTherefore, solving Equation (1) after imposing the boundary conditions, it is\npossible to derive the values of and to finally extract , given that E is the\ncantilever elastic modulus, I is its second moment of inertia, and is the\nbeam\u2019s mass per unit length.\n\nThe second moment of inertia of the beam was calculated as the following:\n\nwhere b is the beam width and t its thickness.\n\nImposing the boundary conditions and solving the above written equations, the\nfirst resonant frequency is found to be equal to the following:\n\nwhere is the free length, is the total cantilever length (equal to m), is the\ntotal mass (equal to kg), E is equal to 9 GPa, and I results equal to m^4.\n\nThe results obtained through this final equation are almost identical to the\nones obtained through simulation for the LDT0-028K sensor, and allow a better\nunderstanding of how ANSYS solves the modal analysis.\n\n#### 5.2. Preliminary Tests\n\nTo initiate preliminary tests, the sizing of the main components was\ndetermined based on the evaluation of power requirements and energy\navailability. First of all, the input capacitor was sized, exploiting the\nloading currents reported in Table 1. From the power consumption analysis, the\ntotal energy required by the load during a transmission burst can be\ncalculated following Equation (5), where represents the buck converter output\nvoltage, is the average current draw during a burst and is the total active\ntime required to complete a transmission.\n\nIn a similar way, we can express the energy variation on the input side as\ndescribed in Equation (6), where is the voltage drop observed across the\ncapacitor when subjected to an energy variation\n\nConsidering that was configured to , looking at the harvester\u2019s datasheet\nreveals the hysteresis cycle of the UVLO, with and . To prevent the load from\nshutting off, the maximum voltage drop across the input capacitor should be\nless than the hysteresis amplitude (). This implies that the energy variation\nresulting from load activation, factoring in the buck converter\u2019s efficiency\n(approximately ), must be within the allowed energy variation at the input\nside. Furthermore, it is important to notice that the sizing equations are\nderived by using the worst-case condition. Indeed, from the harvester\u2019s\ndatasheet, the efficiency is guaranteed to be at least greater than , possibly\nup to . Given that these results are directly provided by the National\nInstruments harvester, additional tests into this aspect were considered\nredundant. The following equation can therefore be used to properly size the\ncapacitor.\n\nFrom which the final capacitance value was estimated to be as follows:\n\nThe values of and were determined based on the characteristics observed in the\ntransmission burst reported in Figure 5. To provide some margin of safety, we\ncalculated , assuming a value of 70 ms, under the assumption that the entire\nload activation occurs at the maximum current draw. To be safe, was used,\nresulting in a slightly oversized capacitor.\n\nHaving determined a suitable capacitor size, we then needed to consider the\noverall power consumption of the system to establish some preliminary\nconsiderations about transmission timings. This helped in determining the\nminimum transmission rate which could guarantee a correct system\u2019s\nfunctioning. Indeed, it is possible to express the voltage variation across\nthe input capacitor as follows:\n\nBy recalling that at the input a constant current equal to 14\u201315 A was tested\nand that when the load is sleeping A are absorbed at the output, the total net\ncurrent flowing into the input capacitor is given by the following:\n\nFrom which, by recalling that in a worst-case condition the activation of the\nload causes a voltage drop equals to the amplitude of the hysteresis cycle, it\nfollows that:\n\nTherefore, in a worst-case condition, where the load causes a voltage drop of\n1 V, a transmission period of 10 min should be large enough to charge the\ninput capacitor to a level sufficient to sustain a new transmission burst.\nHowever, laboratory tests showed that the activation of the load never causes\na voltage drop larger than 0.4\u20130.5 V; therefore, we were also able to test\nhigher transmission rates.\n\nAs a final preliminary test, a characterization was conducted to examine the\npeak-to-peak voltage versus frequency, given a fixed free length of 17 mm,\naiming to validate its proximity to the simulation expectations. The resulting\nplot is illustrated in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10. Tested peak-to-peak voltage for the piezoelectric device clamped at\n17 mm.\n\nSeveral noteworthy observations can be made regarding this plot. First, it is\nevident that the curve does not resemble a \u2018Gaussian\u2019 shape, but rather\nexhibits various small peaks for lower frequencies than the resonant one. This\ndeviation from the expected shape may be attributed to the experimental setup\nutilized in this study, which involves a wooden table as the medium for\nvibration propagation. The table likely possesses internal resonances and may\nrespond differently to various stimuli. Consequently, it is possible that the\nvibration reaching the base of the piezoelectric transducer undergoes slight\nfrequency alterations under different excitations. Such characteristics are\nreflective of more realistic environments, where perfectly sinusoidal\nvibrations generated by a shaker are unattainable.\n\nAlthough the structure may indeed introduce some alterations to the\ncharacteristic, the primary peak remains distinctly visible and occurs around\n54 Hz. This finding deviates slightly from the simulation outcome, which\nyielded a resonant frequency of Hz for a 17 mm free length. The minor variance\ncan once more be attributed to the approximations inherent in the 3D model.\n\nHowever, rather than focusing solely on the best-case scenario, which is often\nchallenging to replicate in real-world environments, the subsequent section\ndeliberately analyzes the system\u2019s power consumption and its charging trends\nunder a 50 Hz vibration. Given that the peak-to-peak voltage at 50 Hz is\nsignificantly smaller compared to the resonant frequency one, assessing the\nsystem\u2019s ability to harvest sufficient energy at this frequency is crucial. If\nthe system can indeed achieve satisfactory energy harvesting at 50 Hz, it\nsuggests that piezoelectric sensors such as the LDTM-028K can be effectively\nutilized even without perfect tuning to the resonant frequency. These tests\ndemonstrate the sensors\u2019 capability to provide adequate energy in different\nenvironments, highlighting their practical value in real-world applications.\n\n#### 5.3. Power Consumption Tests\n\nOne last series of tests was conducted to analyze the overall behavior of the\nsystem, including both the transmission subsystem and the harvesting\ncomponent. The final goal was to observe the device\u2019s operation over extended\nworking periods to establish whether the piezoelectric transducers could\nensure energy self-sufficiency for a given transmission rate. To evaluate the\ndevice\u2019s behavior, a Keysight Technologies 34461A Digital Multimeter was\nconfigured to sample the voltage across the input capacitor. This specific\nmultimeter exploits an internal memory capable of storing samples for\nobservation periods lasting up to two hours. Hence, this feature was used to\ntest the system over longer observation intervals. The tests were carried out\nafter allowing sufficient time for the vibrations of the vibrating plane to\nstabilize. However, as observed in the subsequent voltage trends, minor\nfluctuations persist over extended periods, resulting in variable charging\nrates. Nonetheless, the objective of this study is to demonstrate that\nproperly excited piezoelectric transducers can support a general-purpose IoT\napplication. Thus, as long as a positive trend is evident across the storage\ncapacitor, the design specifications are met, despite the lack of constancy\nover time. As previously mentioned, to face the low currents flowing into the\ninput capacitor, five piezoelectric sensors were connected in parallel. Their\ncompact size enables the placement of multiple piezos on the same vibrating\nsurface without significant space wastage, thereby increasing the energy\nharvested and allowing for heavier load conditions.\n\nAn initial transmission period of 20 min was employed, and from this starting\npoint, the system was pushed into progressively more demanding conditions by\nincreasing the transmission rate. The MCU unit and the LoRaWAN module were\nprogrammed to wake up only for the time necessary to complete the packet\ntransmission. All trends are depicted in Figure 11, where all traces are\noverlapped to facilitate comparison.\n\nFigure 11. Capacitor voltage trend for different transmission rates over\n40-min observation interval.\n\nNotably, focusing on the green trace, which represents a transmission every 20\nmin, the downward peaks align with RFM95 transceiver activation. Although\nthese peaks decelerate the charging process, they do not significantly impact\nthe overall trend. At the end of the 40-min observation interval, there\nremains a margin of almost . As previously noted, the charging speed gradually\nslows towards the end of the observation period, attributed to variations in\nthe vibrating plane and the decreased performance of the power amplifier due\nto heating. Although the introduction of a few cooling fans mitigated the\nlatter effect, since the overall trend remains positive, further investigation\ninto this aspect was not necessary.\n\nFollowing the observed margin in the initial test, the transmission rate was\nincremented to one transmission every 10 min, and subsequently, to a radio\ntransmission every 5 min. The voltage trends obtained are depicted in Figure\n11 in red and blue. Once more, a positive trend was noted, with an overall\nvoltage gain inversely correlated with the transmission rate. Focusing on the\nfirst transmission observed in all the traces depicted in Figure 11, an\nimportant observation arises. It is observable that the charging slope before\nthe first transmission is slightly higher than the slope immediately following\nthe initial downward peak. This observation aligns with the theoretical\nanalysis, as before the first peak, the buck converter has not yet reached\nregulation, and thus, no load is connected to the system. Conversely, when the\ninput voltage crosses the input hysteresis threshold, the load reaches\nregulation status, initiating the first transmission and placing the MCU into\na sleep state, awaiting a new burst. As noted previously, during this phase,\ndespite being in a low-power mode, the MCU displays residual consumption,\nwhich slows down the capacitor\u2019s charging phase.\n\nBecause the voltage level barely increases, we can say that this setup (one\ncollection and transmission every 5 min) is the minimum for the system to\nwork. However, this rate is nearly the same as the recommended channel\noccupancy limit for LoRaWAN transmissions, which is about 3 min for the\nsettings used. Therefore, we can affirm that the piezos, when utilized as\nharvesters, can sustain the system\u2019s operation. Another noteworthy\nobservation, evident from comparing the three traces, is the variable slope of\nthe charging phase between two transmission peaks. Notably, the red trace,\ncorresponding to a lower transmission rate compared to the blue one, exhibits\na smaller slope during the initial twenty-minute observation interval. This\nbehavior appears inconsistent with theoretical expectations, as lower\ntransmission rates typically coincide with faster charging trends. However,\nthis discrepancy can be attributed to the inherent instability of the\nvibrating setup, which may require extended intervals to stabilize. This\ninstability is particularly evident in the latter twenty minutes, where the\nred trace surpasses the blue one. Despite this unexpected effect, the positive\ntrend is still present, demonstrating the effectiveness of the charging\nprocess even in not ideal conditions.\n\nBuilding upon the findings from the power consumption tests, the subsequent\ndiscussion chapter explores the implications of the results and explores\npotential further research and development.\n\n## 6\\. Discussion\n\nThe studies performed on the proposed architecture reported interesting\nresults. An array of five piezoelectric transducers was tested, demonstrating\nits capability to sustain a general low-power IoT application by harvesting\nenergy from vibrations. In the final test campaign, which monitored the system\nduring many transmission bursts within a 40-min timeframe, it was demonstrated\nthat the piezoelectric transducers can provide energy autonomy for\ntransmissions occurring at intervals of no less than 5 min. Although\nindividual transducers generated relatively low currents, their small size and\nlow cost make them suitable for parallel connection. This configuration can\nsignificantly increase overall harvesting efficiency, which proves useful in\npractical applications where high-power sensors might be integrated. In such\nscenarios, the ease of adding multiple transducers allows the system to\nharvest enough energy to support quasi real-time data transmission.\nFurthermore, the addition of multiple piezoelectric sensors can be beneficial,\nmostly in real-world environments, particularly where vibrations are not\nstrictly sinusoidal and occur across a wide frequency range. Unlike sinusoidal\nfunctions, which are confined to specific frequencies, random vibrations span\na continuous spectrum with fluctuating amplitudes and phases over time. Such\nvibrations are prevalent in applications such as vehicle dynamics and\nindustrial machinery. As demonstrated in this paper, employing small\npiezoelectric sensors like the LDTM-028K enables easy adaptation of harvesting\nsystems to various frequencies. By mounting multiple transducers with\ndifferent free lengths (and therefore assigning specific frequency ranges to\neach), energy can be harvested from a diverse range of frequencies. This\nversatility is facilitated by the compact dimensions of these sensors and\ncould not be obtained with the piezoelectric energy-harvesting systems\nanalyzed up to now in the literature. Consider the scenario where there is a\nneed to harvest energy from a car\u2019s vibrations across various road types.\nTypically, with harvesters available in the literature, it is challenging to\nconsistently extract sufficient energy because they are tuned to specific\nfrequencies. However, by adhering to vibrational limits set by standards\n(e.g., ISO 16750-3 [32] for road vehicle equipment), it is feasible to extract\nthe frequency range within which a specific car component must vibrate. By\nmounting multiple small piezoelectric sensors with different free lengths, one\ngains the flexibility to consistently extract the necessary energy. This\napproach ensures that regardless of the road type, sufficient energy can be\nharvested. Moreover, the calculation of the necessary free length becomes\nstraightforward once an equation like (4) is available.\n\nTo this end, this paper deliberately explores the behavior of piezoelectric\nsensors when subjected to a frequency different from their \u201cbuilt-in\u201d one,\nwith the aim of demonstrating the feasibility of creating fully operational\nharvesting systems under diverse environmental conditions. The tests were\nindeed conducted at 50 Hz, whereas the maximum harvested energy occurs around\n54\u201355 Hz for a fixed free length of 17 mm. Remarkably, a positive charging\ntrend was observed despite the setup not operating under ideal conditions.\nThis observation highlights the adaptability of these devices to harvest\nenergy from the environment, even without being finely tuned to a specific\nworking frequency. Additionally, the selection of the 50 Hz frequency was\nbased on its proximity to the most prevalent frequencies in industrial\nvibrations. In industrial settings, vibration frequencies are often regulated\naccording to standards such as ISO 10816 [33], which provides guidelines for\nevaluating machine vibration by measuring vibration severity. These standards\ntypically present Power Spectral Density (PSD) curves, outlining a profile of\nacceleration versus frequency for random vibrations. These curves are valuable\nfor easily determining the operating spectrum of industrial machinery\nvibrations.\n\nThe next section summarizes these insights into practical recommendations and\noutlines the significance of this study\u2019s outcomes.\n\n## 7\\. Conclusions\n\nThis paper aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of using commercially\navailable piezoelectric transducers, typically used as standard sensors, to\ngenerate enough power to serve as an alternative energy source for low-power\ndata transmission in an IoT application. The LoRaWAN architecture was chosen\ndue to its good adaptability for low-power sensor nodes. We proposed a WSN\nspecifically designed for low-power applications, where any sensor with\ndominant power consumption during a transmission burst can be integrated into\nthe system. Piezoelectric transducers can nowadays be employed in a wide\nvariety of environments; however, in an industrial scenario, they can easily\nbe employed to harvest energy from many vibrating surfaces with very little\ncost and good scalability.\n\nAlthough the proposed energy-harvesting architecture shows good results, there\nis room for improvement when integrating practical sensors. We plan to conduct\nextended day-long tests. In the current tests, observation time was limited by\nour vibration generation method. Cooling fans were used to manage heat buildup\nin the amplifier and body shaker, but this limited vibration amplitude and\nshortened tests.\n\nAs future work, real implementations of the solution are expected to be\ndeveloped. Indeed, this work aimed at providing general-purpose results: this\nmeans that no specific sensor was chosen when conducting the tests. However,\nin order to fully validate the technology, a real implementation of a sensing\nsystem is expected to be carried out. To this aim, a possible scenario may\nforesee the implementation of an environmental monitoring solution to be\ndeployed in a construction site. Indeed, in this application scenario,\nmachines generating vibrations are relatively common and may be thus equipped\nwith the piezoelectric harvesters powering the sensing platforms. Moreover,\nenvironmental monitoring proves to be an especially challenging test bench,\nsince the measurement of air-related parameters (Carbon Dioxide, Carbon\nMonoxide, Particulate Matter, etc.) requires, in general, extremely power-\nhungry sensors.\n\nAnother exciting future development involves a monitoring sensor node with a\nrechargeable battery to back up the system during temporary harvesting\noutages. Although the storage capacitor worked during transmission bursts, its\ninternal resistance resulted in quick energy dissipation when the harvesting\nsource was temporally disconnected from the harvester. This limits deployment\nin critical scenarios like alarm systems where reliable power is essential.\n\nFinally, another aspect that may be investigated in the near future concerns\nthe utilization of hybrid harvesting solutions. Indeed, harvesters embedded\nwithin IoT devices are in general of small dimensions and are thus able to\ngenerate a limited amount of energy. However, more than one energy source may\nbe present in the deployment location. For example, within the industrial\ncontext, together with vibrations, heat sources may also be available,\nsuggesting the combination of TEGs and piezoelectric sensors. Such a promising\napproach, which may foresee the combination of more than one energy source,\nmay be especially suitable in all those applications featuring a relatively\nhigh energy requirement.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, F.R. and A.P.; methodology, F.R., M.M. and A.P.; software,\nF.R.; validation, F.R. and M.M.; formal analysis, F.R. and M.M.;\ninvestigation, F.R., M.M. and A.P.; resources, A.P.; data curation, F.R. and\nM.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.R. and M.M.; supervision, A.P.
