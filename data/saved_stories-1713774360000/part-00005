(July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nTraffic Message Channel (TMC) is a technology for delivering traffic and\ntravel information to motor vehicle drivers. It is digitally coded using the\nALERT C or TPEG protocol into Radio Data System (RDS)^[1] carried via\nconventional FM radio broadcasts. It can also be transmitted on Digital Audio\nBroadcasting or satellite radio. TMC allows silent delivery of dynamic\ninformation suitable for reproduction or display in the user's language\nwithout interrupting audio broadcast services. Both public and commercial\nservices are operational in many countries. When data is integrated directly\ninto a navigation system, traffic information can be used in the system's\nroute calculation.\n\nA Radio Data System \u2013 Traffic Message Channel (RDS-TMC) receiver (left)\nattached to a TomTom navigation system via a USB cable. The other side of the\nreceiver is connected to a car charger via an antenna-power combination\ncable.^[2]\n\n## Development[edit]\n\nDetailed technical proposals for an RDS-TMC broadcasting protocol were first\ndeveloped in the European Community's DRIVE programme^[3] research project\nRDS-ALERT, a partnership of the BBC, Philips, Blaupunkt, TRRL and CCETT led by\nCastle Rock Consultants (CRC).^[4] The main goal of the project was to develop\nand build consensus upon a draft standard for broadcasting RDS-TMC traffic\nmessages in densely coded digital form.^[5]\n\nAn initial proposal for defining RDS-TMC data fields had been made to the\nEuropean Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) in Madrid, based on a\nscheme developed by CCETT and Philips in the Eureka-sponsored CARMINAT\nresearch project.^[6] This proposal required the use of at least two 104-bit\nRDS data groups for each message. Within these RDS Groups, 32 bits per group\nwould be used for traffic data, giving a total traffic message length of 64\nbits. A second proposal, by Bosch-Blaupunkt and the German Road Research\nInstitute BASt, sought to use just a single RDS Group per traffic message.\nThen, in 1987, the CEC invited Castle Rock Consultants to lead a joint team\nthat would take TMC development a stage further.^[7] CRC produced a proposal\nfor a modified BASt/Blaupunkt single group message definition, which became\nknown as the ALERT A coding scheme. Tests also continued at CCETT and BBC on\nthe CARMINAT approach, which formed the basis of an alternative ALERT B coding\nproposal.\n\nA major question addressed in the Alert A scheme was the total number of\ntraffic event locations to be coded. Initial estimates suggested that, in\nEurope, a maximum of 65,000 significant junctions might be needed for the\nFederal Republic of Germany. An efficient coding system would require only 16\nbits to code these, simply by numbering each intersection from 1 to 65535.\nCalculations for France, Britain and elsewhere suggested that around 30,000 to\n40,000 locations should be enough for most European national or U.S. statewide\nsystems. A standard 16-bit location code was, therefore, adopted for inter-\nurban networks. The Madrid proposal of 1987, by comparison, had required 33\nbits to code problem location, with separate fields for road number, road\nclass, area of the country, etc. These 33 bits gave a theoretical total of 8.5\nbillion location codes, most of which could never be used.^[8]\n\nAfter consultation with ECMT, a combined approach was developed called the\nALERT C Protocol that aimed to combine the best features of each approach.\nALERT A and C replaced the CARMINAT message categories cause, effect and\nadvice with a single 11-bit basic message code. This permits up to 2048 basic\nmessage phrases to be broadcast. The new ALERT protocols significantly\nincreased the efficiency of message coding, shortening the basic message\ncontent from 18 to 11 bits. In conjunction with the revised location codes,\nwhich saved 17 of the 33 bits previously assigned, this allowed the great\nmajority of traffic messages to be broadcast using a single TMC data sequence.\nIn 1991, ECMT recommended moving forward with further testing of the\nprotocols.^[9] The work continued with a larger consortium including Volvo and\nFord Motor Company in the European Commission's DRIVE II project ATT-\nALERT.^[10]\n\n## Operation[edit]\n\nEach traffic incident is binary-encoded and sent as a TMC message. Each\nmessage consists of an event code, location code, expected incident duration,\naffected extent and other details.\n\nThe message contains a list of up to 2048 event phrases defined by 11 binary\nbits (of which 1402 were in use as of 2007) that can be translated by the\nreceiver into the user's language. Some phrases describe individual situations\nsuch as a crash, while others cover combinations of events such as\nconstruction causing long delays.\n\nIn Europe, location code tables are maintained on a national level. Those\nlocation tables are integrated in the maps provided by in-vehicle navigation\nsystem companies such as HERE Technologies and TomTom and by vehicle\nmanufacturers such as Volvo. In other countries, such as the U.S. and Canada,\nprivate companies maintain the location tables and market TMC services\ncommercially.\n\nSources of traffic information typically include police, traffic control\ncenters, camera systems, traffic speed detectors, floating car data, winter\ndriving reports and roadwork reports.\n\n## Coordination[edit]\n\nTMC-Forum, a non-profit organization whose members included service providers,\nreceiver manufacturers, car manufacturers, map vendors, broadcasters (public\nand private), automobile clubs, and public authorities, was a forum to discuss\ntraffic information related matters. It maintained the TMC-Standard (ISO\n14819). On 11 November 2007, the TMC-Forum and the TPEG-Forum merged into the\nTraveller Information Services Association (TISA).^[11] TISA has taken over\nall of TMC-Forum's activities and responsibilities.^[12]\n\n## Functionality[edit]\n\nRDS-TMC is a low-bandwidth system. Each RDS-TMC traffic message comprises 37\ndata bits sent at most 1\u20133 times per second, using a low capacity data channel\nprimarily designed for FM radio station name identification and tuning.\nCompressing traffic incident descriptions in multiple languages into 16 bits\nfor a location, 11 bits for an event description code, plus 3 bits for the\nevent's extent and a few extra bits for the duration/system management was\nnecessary due to pre-existing constraints in the RDS standard. Almost all the\nother broadcast data bits were already assigned from each 104-bit RDS Group.\n\nA major design challenge of RDS-TMC was to find a way of describing traffic\nevent locations across an entire state or country.^[8] Such a system could not\nconvey precise latitude-longitude data (available 25 years later using GPS in\napplications such as Waze). Instead, RDS-TMC relies on the use of location\ntables that point only to significant highway junctions. The precision of each\ntraffic event's location is low compared to that of modern smartphone devices.\nThe user's navigation system locates a driver to about 3 metres (10 feet), but\nonly knows, for example, that a crash took place between Exit 3 and Exit 4,\nnorthbound on a particular motorway. This limitation requires that traffic\nevents (accidents, congestion, burst water mains, faulty traffic lights, etc.)\nhave to be superimposed onto maps by mapping the reported location to the TMC\nlocation table. If the nearest location table point lies at some distance from\nthe exact position of the incident, then the report appears on a section of\nmain road between two junctions instead of at its exact location. The limited\nprecision can make a significant difference as to how navigation devices\ninterpret the incident, potentially leading to an occasional poor route\nchoice.\n\nIn the US and elsewhere, systems such as CARS (Condition Acquisition and\nReporting System)^[13]^[14] can pinpoint event locations or their start and\nend points with one-metre precision. These real-time data are published in XML\nfor access by companies such as Google and TomTom.^[15] These incident reports\ncan be delivered to mobile phones and handheld devices in vehicles.^[16]^[17]\nHowever, major real-world traffic incidents usually spread from hundreds of\nmetres up to many kilometres, once traffic backups have developed. On\nmotorways and other major roads, there are typically few or no detours\navailable between significant junctions, which are all included in the TMC\nlocation tables. Many traffic report locations are only approximate, and as\nqueues grow, locations can change swiftly. So GPS-based systems are more\nprecise, but are not necessarily more accurate.\n\n## Security[edit]\n\nIn April 2007, two Italian security researchers presented research about RDS-\nTMC^[18] at the CanSecWest^[19] security conference. The presentation,\nentitled \"Unusual Car Navigation Tricks\", raised the point that RDS-TMC is a\nwireless cleartext protocol and showed how to build a receiver and transmitter\nwith inexpensive electronics capable of injecting false and potentially\ndangerous messages.^[18]\n\nDetailed instructions and schematics were published in Issue No. 64 of Phrack\nhacking magazine.^[20]\n\nThe TMC Forum responded by stating that the effects of any 'pirate' TMC\nbroadcasts would be non-existent on users not on routes affected by fake\nobstruction messages and that such broadcasts would directly interfere with\nthat country's TMC carrier station, which would lead to criminal or civil\nliability. They stated that it was therefore unlikely that such activity would\ntake place.^[21]\n\nActual RDS-TMC attacks have been known to occur, for instance in Belgium in\n2019 where road users were warned of \"air raids on the E40 road\" in March and\nthat \"firefights broke out on the E17\" in August .^[22] Official government\nadvice was to ignore these messages, local police services admitted that\nlocating the source of the transmissions was going to be difficult and that \u2013\neven though clearly communication laws were broken \u2013 arrests or convictions\nwere unlikely.\n\n## Devices and navigation programs[edit]\n\nAn RDS-TMC receiver is a special FM radio tuner that can decode TMC data.\nSatellite TMC receivers use a dedicated data channel that is broadcast as part\nof much larger broadcast digital audio channels. TMC data is decoded by\nmatching event and location codes against look-up tables of phrases and\nlocations. The results can be translated into audio or visually displayed on a\nSat nav device. The look-up tables must be implemented in a service-specific\ndatabase mapped to geographic routes and intersections. As with the navigation\nsystems themselves, periodic upgrades are needed as the road system changes.\nThis provides opportunities for vendors to generate revenue.^[23]\n\nThe technical concepts of RDS-TMC originated about 30 years ago, initially by\nBlaupunkt and Philips. With European Commission funding, the BBC, Transport\nResearch Laboratory and CCETT came together in a team led by Castle Rock\nConsultants to develop the standard. More recently, personal navigation\ndevices (PND) have emerged as an alternative way to deliver traffic\ninformation via mobile devices employing GPS.^[24]^[25]\n\nAutomobile companies continue to roll out RDS-TMC products. One reason is that\nthe use of mobile devices is attracting legislative attention due to concerns\nabout driver distraction. Like car radios, in-vehicle navigation systems have\nnot so far generated the same concerns and may continue to outsell handheld\nsolutions.\n\nHigher-end models of personal navigation assistants come with a built-in TMC\nreceiver,^[26] and depending on the country, the service is available in\nEclipse, Garmin, iPhone (Navigon), Navman, Navway, Mio, Pioneer, TomTom and\nUniden navigation systems, as well as in Volvo, BMW and Ford Falcon navigation\nsystems, among many others.\n\nTMC adapters can extend mobile navigation systems with integrated GPS\nreceivers with TMC functionality. They can include a bluetooth or USB\nconnection. The adapter passes traffic messages to the navigation software for\nroute calculations. The adapters generally include a connector for FM/TMC, an\nantenna (2,5mm phone jack or MCX jack 50 Ohm). Compatible navigation programs\ninclude AvMap, Destinator PN, Falk Navigator TMC Edition (special version for\nMyGuide Navigator 6500XL TMC Bundle), GoPal, iGO, Mireo, Navigon MN5, Route\n66, and Sygic.^[27]^[28]^[29]\n\n## Coverage[edit]\n\nIn some places, TMC coverage is smaller than that of the radio programme\ncarrying the TMC service, therefore white spots exist. For example, in the US,\none of the two TMC commercial services is run by Clear Channel Communications,\nwhose 95 FM station urban markets typically have some level of traffic\ninformation service. Another is Sirius Satellite Radio, which covers all of\nNorth America, including sparsely-populated rural areas and near-empty\ndeserts. Although vendors are beginning^[citation needed] to make arrangements\nwith information systems such as CARS, operated by state police and state\ndepartments of transportation, coverage is likely to remain sketchy in some\nstates during the next few years.\n\n## Operation worldwide[edit]\n\nThe following countries provide a TMC service:\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\nIntelematics Australia^[30] broadcasts a national encrypted RDS-TMC service\nfocused initially on urban Australia under the brand 'SUNA Traffic Channel'.\nThe service reaches around 85% of urban Australia, using commercial FM\nbroadcasters in seven cities, as well as via XML for online and smartphone\napplications. The service is available on GPS navigation systems including\nNavman, Mio, Uniden, iPhone (Navigon & Sygic), Eclipse, Pioneer, Alpine and\nClarion. SUNA Traffic Channel is also available in Ford, Holden, Honda,\nToyota, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, and many other navigation systems.^[31] SUNA is\ncurrently the only source of comprehensive, metropolitan congestion monitoring\ncontent in Australia \u2013 proprietary technology interfaces to traffic light\ncontrol systems. The SUNA broadcast service is fully compliant with both RDS\nand TMC. However, since the broadcast is encrypted it does not work on in-car\nGPS navigation systems that do not have a commercial arrangement with SUNA.\n\n### Austria[edit]\n\nIn Austria, ORF broadcasts a free service on radio channels \u00d61, \u00d62 (9 regional\nchannels), Hitradio \u00d63 and FM4. It is supported by the Federal Ministry for\nTraffic, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT). ASFINAG is responsible for the\nlocation table, currently version 2.1, which received updates to handle\nincreased use during Euro 2008. Its location table contains around 8,000\ncodes.\n\n### Baltic region[edit]\n\nMediamobile Nordic plans to broadcast traffic information in the Baltic\nregion.^[32] As of 2014, no service is reportedly available in Latvia,\nLithuania or Estonia,^[33] although location tables (maintained by Destia)\nwere certified by TISA in 2008.^[34] As of 2017, an unencrypted TMC service is\navailable on Viker Raadio in Estonia. Mediamobile has a traffic information\ncenter in Estonia for the Nordic region.\n\n### Belgium[edit]\n\nBelgium hosts TMC services: TMOBILIS in Belgium, TIC-VL in Flanders and RTBF\nin Wallonia and Brussels. Except for TMOBILIS, they are all currently open\nservices.\n\nTMOBILIS is provided by Be-Mobile and Touring Mobilis. It is the only fully\nBelgian service. It combines all Belgian sources from the Flemish, Walloon and\nBrussels government, police stations, a national Floating Car Data system\nbased on GPS positions from vehicles and the Touring Mobilis call center. It\nis nationally broadcast by both VRT on Studio Brussel for Flanders and RTBF on\nClassic 21 in Wallonia and Brussels.\n\nTIC-VL is broadcast by VRT on Radio 2 and uses content from the Vlaams\nVerkeerscentrum.^[35] Coverage of content and transmissions is limited to\nFlanders.\n\nIn Wallonia and Brussels, CLASS.21 is broadcast by RTBF on Classic 21. The\nservice is from the Centre PEREX of the Service public de Wallonie (SPW,\nformerly MET) in collaboration with TMC4U. Coverage of transmissions and\ncontent are limited to Wallonia and Brussels.\n\nTechnum creates the location tables by order of the regional communities.\nSince December 2004 broadcast messages use location table version 1.4b, which\nadded N-roads. The latest version is 2.9 (^[36]).\n\n### Bulgaria[edit]\n\nA national TMC service for Bulgaria started beta testing in December 2010. The\nservice is provided by TrafficNav,^[37] a Budapest based traffic information\ncompany in cooperation with the broadcast hardware manufacturer Kvarta.^[38]\nData sources include real time traffic information provided by tix.bg,^[39]\npresently for Sofia. The service can be accessed by most Garmin navigation\ndevices and will soon be supported in several factory car navigation devices.\n\n### Colombia[edit]\n\nLegislation does not allow the insertion of external digital data into\nanalogue FM transmissions and the use of RDS-TMC technology is also banned.\n\n### Czechia[edit]\n\nTMC developments in the Czech Republic are coordinated by CEDA, which is\nresponsible for the location table. Its current version is 4.1, containing\nmore than 16,000 records.\n\nThere were 3 providers of TMC service in Czech republic:\n\nJSDI \u2013 transmitted on \u010cesk\u00fd rozhlas Radio\u017eurn\u00e1l \u2013 is a free TMC service\nprovided by the Czech Road Motorway Directorate (\u0158SD \u010cR). Content consists of\nclosures, road restrictions and winter maintenance across the country,\naccident information from rescue services and detailed content from TIC\nPrague. In December 2022, service moved from FM network of \u010cesk\u00fd rozhlas\nVltava to \u010cesk\u00fd rozhlas Radio\u017eurn\u00e1l due to much better country coverage.\n\nDIC PRAHA \u2013 transmitted on frequency of \u010cesk\u00fd rozhlas Plus \u2013 92.6 MHz,\nprovided detailed traffic information for Prague only\n\nCloesed TMC services:\n\nTELEASIST \u2013 (TMC service switched off in 2017) was transmitted on radio\nnetwork of \u010cesk\u00fd rozhlas Radio\u017eurn\u00e1l and available countrywide.

The current version is 11.1 and contains\naround 10,000 location codes.\n\n### Finland[edit]\n\nV-Traffic, the commercial service in Finland, is provided by MediaMobile since\n2007. The service covers the largest cities and roads 1\u2013999, covering the\nwhole country. TMC messages are broadcast nationally on Yle Radio Suomi.\nV-Traffic uses several information sources to broadcast validated traffic\ndata, including floating car data as well as data from public authorities,\ntraffic cameras, radio stations, road users and several partnership companies.\nThe service is encrypted, based on specifications set by the TISA. The service\nis available on the majority of navigation units sold in new cars, such as\nVolkswagen, Audi, Seat, Opel, Volvo, Toyota, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru,\nSuzuki and Skoda, as well as portable navigation devices from Garmin.\n\nThe location table is public and provided by Finnish Traffic Agency.^[40] The\nlatest version, V2.1, contains approximately 28.000 locations points.\n\n### France[edit]\n\nOnly commercial RDS-TMC traffic broadcast services are available in France.\n\nThe commercial service V-Traffic is provided by Mediamobile, a subsidiary of\nTDF, with two shareholders: Renault and Vinci. The traffic service provides\nreal-time information on 185,000 km of main roads in France, including all\nhighways (11 800 km). It is transmitted on the frequencies of France Inter and\nis received nationally (99% national coverage). The service is not encrypted,\nbut restricts access using different location table numbers. In 2010 the\ncompany signed a partnership with M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France for a common road weather\nhazard service.\n\nAnother commercial service is provided by ViaMichelin and Carte Blanche\nConseil, transmitted by the Towercast network (NRJ group). In September 2005\nPSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn signed a partnership with ViaMichelin.\n\nA free TMC service was offered by Autoroute FM but discontinued in 2012.\n\nLocation tables are released by the government agency SETRA.

Navteq Maps\neditions since Q3/2011 now provide TMC coverage for Portugal. There are now\nthree TMC channels in Portugal.^[56]\n\nRecently, Summer Blast^[57] radio was included in the TMC providing coverage\nfor Portugal.\n\n### Romania[edit]\n\nStarting 30 May 2012, TMC service is available in Romania, on private radio\nstation (ProFM). The service is provided by TrafficNav.^[58]\n\nTraficOK was the first TMC system tested and implemented in Romania. The\nsystem uses a location table of over 11,500 entries, which provides nearly\nfull coverage of the Romanian road infrastructure. The table was developed by\nAROBS and certified by TISA \u2013 Traveller Information Services Association. Data\non traffic flow, events, weather warnings, road repairs and traffic jams is\ncollected from several sources. The TraficOK project was developed by AROBS\nTransilvania Software^[59] and Be-Mobile.^[60] Messages are sent via Europa FM\nradio stations (in FM bandwidth) to various hardware equipment (navigation\nsystems, mobile phones, etc.) equipped with TMC modules.\n\nTraficOK was planned to be available in Bucharest, Ploie\u0219ti, Pite\u0219ti,\nConstan\u021ba, Bra\u0219ov, Cluj-Napoca, T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, Oradea, Arad, Timi\u0219oara, Ia\u0219i and\nBac\u0103u.\n\n### Singapore[edit]\n\nIn June 2006, GEWI Europe GmbH & Co. KG^[45] released the first TISA certified\nTMC Location Table for Singapore. Its Singapore company, GEWI Asia Pacific\nPte. Ltd. offered the service. The latest location table version 1.3, updated\nand certified in March 2014, includes the Marina Coastal Expressway, more than\n150 car park locations within the Central Business District and downtown\nareas. GEWI's traffic services are available on several models of Smartphones,\nPAPAGO!, Garmin and TomTom navigation devices, Honda and Toyota in-car\nnavigation systems.\n\nIn Nov 2010, the Land Transport Authority announced the release of the\nLocation Table for Singapore. Quantum Inventions offers a traffic data service\nbased on this location table and includes traffic incidents information,\ntraffic speeds, parking availability, weather, road closures, etc. Various\nbrands of GPS systems using the Galactio software provide these dynamic data\nin the navigation system.\n\n### Slovakia[edit]\n\nThere are two RDS-TMC services running in Slovakia.\n\n\"SSC RTVS\" \u2013 is a free public TMC service transmitting on the network of\nSlovensky Rozhlas \u2013 Radio Slovensko. Transmitted content consist mainly of\nstatic information \u2013 roadworks and closures. Information transmitted in this\nservice are shown also on web www.zjazdnost.sk of Slovenska sprava ciest.\n\n\"DECELL (SK)\" \u2013 is a paid service, which was launched in May 2013. Messages\nare transmitted countrywide on the private station Fun Radio. Information\nconsists of current traffic situation provided by CE-Traffic a.s and is\navailable exclusively for owners of Garmin navigation devices.\n\nIn September 2018, a new version 4.0 of location tables was issued, covering\nall highways and all important roads. This version replaced older version 3.2\nreleased in 2014.\n\n### Slovenia[edit]\n\nA national TMC-service became available in June 2009. The service is provided\nby TrafficNav,^[37] the Budapest traffic information company and is available\non two national FM networks of Radiotelevizija Slovenija, Slovenia's National\nPublic Radio (ARS and Radio SI). The service can be accessed by most Garmin,\nNavigon and Navo navigation devices^[44] and will soon be featured in several\nfactory fitted car navigation devices. The service is based on V3.0 of the\nSlovenia location table.\n\nThe Motorway Company in the Republic of Slovenia prepared a new location table\nDARS 702\u201335, V1.1 which is freely available^[61] for integration in maps. The\nservice is also transmitted on two national FM networks of Radiotelevizija\nSlovenija, Slovenia's National Public Radio (Prvi and Radio Val 202).\n\n### South Africa[edit]\n\nGarmin was first to offer the service in South Africa, in time for the FIFA\nSoccer World Cup in 2010. Navigon coming on board shortly thereafter.\n\nTMC services in South Africa have been available since late 2009, a service\nprovided by Altech Netstar.^[62] In partnership with INRIX,^[63] Altech\nNetstar broadcasts their Premium Traffic Service throughout Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu\nNatal and Western Cape Peninsula. The company planned to launch in Orange Free\nState, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga in 2012. Altech Netstar offers a commercial\nservice to its OEM and Commercial Customers. Altech Netstar broadcasts XML\nservices to their device partners and wholesale customers.\n\n### Spain[edit]\n\nA TMC service is available in Spain on RNE 3. It is provided by SCT as the\noperator of traffic management in Catalonia Autonomous Community, DT in the\nBasque Country Autonomous Community and DGT (Traffic General Directorate) for\nthe rest of the country.\n\nRoad network coverage is the motorways, national roads and first level roads\nthat belong to the Autonomous Communities. RACC^[64] is working on urban\nservices, starting with Seville and Barcelona to broadcast on RNE 2.\n\nLocation tables are provided by DGT, Direcci\u00f3n General de Tr\u00e1fico. The current\nversion is 2.1 and contains about 7.750 entries.\n\n### Sweden[edit]\n\nThe most used^[citation needed] TMC service in Sweden is run by Mediamobile\nunder the name V-Traffic Premium RDS-TMC. It is a fully encrypted service with\nfocus on congestions, slippery road warnings and other safety related messages\nfor the driver.\n\nA public service was available in Sweden. Swedish Transport Administration, or\nTrafikverket,^[65] was responsible for the location tables. Version v2.3\ncontained about 17337 data points, and covered 1138000 km of the Sweden road\nnetwork.\n\nThe public service has not been developed since 2009 when the government\ndecided to stop distribution of end user services. The service ended in August\n2022.\n\nSweden is divided into 8 broadcasting zones to avoid transmitting traffic\ninformation that is not useful at that location. They cover the European,\nnational and major county highways. The service is broadcast on Sveriges Radio\nP3 radio station and covers 98 percent of Sweden.\n\nSwedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) has an information page for\nTrafikverket RDS-TMC^[66] in Swedish.\n\n### Switzerland[edit]\n\nA TMC service is available in Switzerland. The broadcaster is SRG SSR id\u00e9e\nsuisse or Swiss Broadcasting Corporation who transmits TMC on FM chain 1 and\nFM chain 3 all over Switzerland.\n\n  * In German speaking areas: Radio SRF 1 (G) / Radio SRF 3 (G) / La 1\u00e8re (F) / Rete Uno (I) partly\n  * In French speaking areas: La 1\u00e8re (F) / Couleur 3 (F) / Radio SRF 1 (G) / Rete Uno (I) partly\n  * In Italian speaking areas: Rete Uno (I) / Rete Tre (I) / Radio SRF 1 (G) / La 1\u00e8re (F)\n\nDaughter company Viasuisse operates the service.\n\nLocation codes are the responsibility of the Swiss Federal Roads Authority\nFEDRO but B+S Ingenieur (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Strassen) distributes the location\ntables. Version 5.5 contains around 10,000 codes.\n\n### Taiwan[edit]\n\nThe Taiwanese police radio station and Ministry of Transportation and\nCommunication (MOTC) both broadcast RDS-TMC traffic data. It is currently\navailable for TomTom, Garmin, Panasonic, PaPaGo and Mio devices.\n\n### Turkey[edit]\n\nTurkey has 3 RDS TMC services. 1: HERE (previously NAVTEQ) has the broadest\nRDS-TMC service in Turkey, covering the largest 11 cities in the country:\nIstanbul, Ankara, Adana, Bursa, Mersin, Izmir, Eskisehir, Antalya, Konya,\nKayseri and Gaziantep. The service was launched in July 2012. 2: TMC service\nin Turkey has been published by Basarsoft and TrafficNav in 2012. RDS TMC is\navailable only in the cities where the traffic congestions are a big problem\nfor the people. Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Antalya, Bursa are the cities where\nbroadcasting is being done. 3: TMC service in Turkey was published by Be-\nMobile and Infotech in 2012. The RDS TMC service is available in Istanbul,\nAnkara, Izmir, Bursa and Antalya.\n\nAll 3 Turkish TMC services are paid services and users can have it in\nNavigation devices. Both PND and Automotive products are using TMC service in\nTurkey.\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\nThe INRIX^[67] provides a commercial TMC service, iTMC in the United Kingdom.\nIt is broadcast nationally on Classic FM and other commercial radio stations.\nThe BBC Charter prohibits it from carrying a commercial service. ITIS provides\ntraffic data on RDS-TMC to major automotive companies (BMW, Mercedes, Toyota,\nFord, Renault, Jaguar Land Rover and others). The price of the service is\nincluded in the price of the car or navigation system.\n\nThis system uses Floating Vehicle Data, which include positional information\nfrom over 160,000 fleet vehicles fitted. The data is complemented by\njournalistic or \"Incident\" data provided by Trafficlink. Trafficlink is owned\nby ITIS and provides traffic and travel bulletins to BBC Radio and to over 95%\nof the UK commercial radio stations. Incident data includes road works,\naccidents and closures.\n\nTrafficmaster, a Teletrac Navman brand, operated a national service using\nlocal and regional radio broadcaster Global Radio which provided reception\nacross mainland Britain. This system used road-side infrastructure to measure\nvehicle travel time between sensors placed a few miles apart, and used number\nplate recognition technology. Data sources used by Teletrac Navman included\nFloating Vehicle data from fitted telematics devices, 8500 under-road\ninductance loops, over 1800 CCTV cameras, Congestion Zone charging cameras,\nPolice control rooms plus a proprietary network of ANPR and IR sensors cameras\nacross the road network. Teletrac Navman provided traffic data on RDS-TMC to\nmajor automotive OEM brands including VW, Audi, Skoda, Mazda, Chrysler, Honda,\nSeat and Vauxhall. Teletrac Navman also supplies the Department for Transport\nwith historical traffic data for modelling purposes which is used by central\nand local governments and their sub-contractors when analyzing road network\nimprovement opportunities. The Trafficmaster service via RDS-TMC was\nwithdrawin at the end of March 2023.\n\nBoth services maintain their own location tables. The current location table\nversion of ITIS is 5.1. The last location table version of Trafficmaster was\n3.1.^[citation needed]\n\n### United States and Canada[edit]\n\nIn the United States of America, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio\nprovide TMC service all over the US. Navteq provides traffic data to both\nproviders. Navteq Traffic delivers traffic information and related advertising\nvia RDS and HD signals to navigation devices nationwide. Navteq also provided\ntraffic data sourced from sensors, probes and other technologies in 10+\ncountries as of December 2009. INRIX, Inc. fuses TMC data with real-time flow\ninformation from its crowd-sourced network of floating cars and mobile devices\nwith information from other public and private sources to deliver real-time\nand predictive traffic information.\n\niHeartMedia and Tele Atlas have a TMC service called Total Traffic Network\n(TTN) (also iHeartMedia's branding for traffic and weather reporting), using\nFM RDS in 77 US cities and three Canadian metropolitan areas.^[68] These\nservices are both offered by subscription and were initially available to many\nin-car navigation units via an expansion module purchased separately.\n\nThe TomTom RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver acquires information through an FM signal\nbroadcast by Clear Channel's regional providers. By connecting a compatible\nTomTom navigation device to the RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver, users receive\ntraffic information via the TMC connection. Traffic alerts appear in the\ntraffic bar on the right side of the screen. Tapping the traffic bar reveals\nfurther information, such as accident or traffic delays. The RDS-TMC Traffic\nReceiver is compatible with the TomTom VIA series, GO 920, TomTom GO 720,\nTomTom ONE XL and TomTom ONE 3rd edition. It integrates RDS-TMC Traffic\ninformation with TomTom GO and ONE products.\n\nIn addition to these after-market services, six major motor manufacturers\noffer RDS-TMC as standard in their U.S. vehicles, including Volvo and BMW.\n\niBiquity HD Radio provides a TMC service based on RDS-TMC.\n\n### Other areas[edit]\n\nIn the Netherlands, a map of current and planned TMC service is available from\nthe Traffic Message Channel.^[69]\n\nIn Luxembourg, no service is currently planned.\n\nA location table for UAE v4.0 has been certified.\n\nIn Turkey, various location tables are available.\n\nIn China, investigations are ongoing to choose a technology for its traffic\ninformation system. The main candidates are the Japanese system VICS and the\nEuropean TMC. A TMC Location table version 1.0 has already been certified.\nFollowing the advancement of 4G/5G and IoT, China is actively planning in\nusing 5G to broadcast traffic message and Hong Kong is also in the path.\nSeveral consultations in ITIS and Electric Vehicle are proceeding in 2019.\n\nIn Serbia, an RDS-TMC system along A1 highway started in July 2019, however\nwith limitations.^[70]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Bluetooth\n  * Google Maps\n  * Intelligent transportation system\n  * Yahoo!
