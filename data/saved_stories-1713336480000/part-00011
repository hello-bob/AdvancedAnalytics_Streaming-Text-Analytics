Vaughan-Nichols\n\nVOXPOP\n\nTry our new 5 second poll. It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTech Conferences: Does Your Employer Pay?\n\nDoes your employer pay for you to attend tech conferences?\n\nYes, registration and travel are comped.\n\nYes, just registration but not travel expenses.\n\nYes, travel expenses but not registration.\n\nOnly virtual conferences.\n\nNo reimbursement.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 SPDX, the open standard for \u201cSystem\u201d Bill of Materials, takes a\nmajor step forward.\n\nFor years, we needed a standard way for companies to standardize their license\nand component information (metadata) in software bills of material (SBOM) to\nease the discovery and labeling of open source components in their products.\n\nThe answer to that problem is Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX), aka the\nInternational Standards Organization (ISO) standard: ISO/IEC 5962:2021. Now,\nat Open Source Summit North America in Seattle, the latest version, SPDX 3.0,\nhas made its appearance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d been a six-year slog, but SPDX now lays out not just the format for a\nsoftware bill of materials but for everything,\u201d said Bob Martin, senior\nprincipal software and supply chain assurance engineer at the Mitre\nCorporation.\n\nThus, going forward, SPDX will now be called System Package Data Exchange \u2014\nindicating its usefulness beyond just software.\n\nHow does the new System Package Data Exchange encompass \u201ceverything\u201d? By\nadding SPDX profiles. It starts with a core SPDX profile that includes all\nprograms, hardware projects, AI, Software as a Service, you name it. Above it\nare profiles for additional metadata for security, licensing and build\ninformation.\n\nSPDX has become much more useful with SPDX profiles. It offers subsets of\ninformation finely tuned for popular use cases such as security, precise\nlicensing, AI model training and more. This enhancement streamlines the use of\nSPDX, empowering stakeholders across the development, security, data science\nand legal sectors.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. Who's Using Ruby on Rails Now and Is It AI Panacea for Devs?\n  2. C# Compiler Lead Jared Parsons on 20 Years at Microsoft\n  3. Golang 1.22 Redefines the For Loop for Easier Concurrency\n  4. Introduction to Zig, a Potential Heir to C\n  5. A Review of Warp, Another Rust-Based Terminal\n\nIf that sounds great but complicated, well, you\u2019re right. To make it easier to\nput SPDX 3.0 to work it Includes ready-to-use profile templates. This will\nsimplify adoption and implementation for developers and end-users.\n\n## Seeking Adoption by Developers\n\nGitHub is also going out of its way to make it easy for programmers to adopt\nit. \u201cWe added SPDX exports to GitHub\u2019s dependency graph to make it easy for\ndevelopers to meet regulatory requirements, and we\u2019ve seen enthusiastic\nadoption from the community in response,\u201d said Justin Hutchings, GitHub\u2019s\nsenior director of product management.\n\n\u201cIncreasing the transparency in the software supply chain is an important\nfoundation to building a more secure world.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s important because SPDX isn\u2019t just a good idea; it\u2019s the law \u2014 at least\nin the United States. Executive Order 14028 requires a \u201cformal record\ncontaining the details and supply chain relationships of various components\nused in building software,\u201d similar to food ingredient labels on the\npackaging. In short, an SBOM.\n\nAn SBOM doesn\u2019t need to use SPDX. There are other standard SBOM formats, such\nas CycloneDX and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE). However, as an ISO\nstandard and with profiles extending SPDX to essentially any platform or\nprocess, SPDX seems to be a safe bet for becoming the dominant standard.\n\nAs Melissa Evers, Intel\u2019s vice president of its software and advanced\ntechnology group, said, \u201cIntel embraces open international standards that help\nprovide transparency and disclosure of security information, complying with\nemergent regulations.\n\n\u201cThe release of SPDX version 3 is an important milestone, as its modular\ndesign allows for the recording of multiple facets of information on software\ncomponents, including security and licensing.\u201d\n\nWith support from numerous other software and security companies and\norganizations, it seems a sure bet that SPDX 3.0 will be the SBOM standard in\nthe years ahead.\n\nSteven J.
