I offer an explanation for this puzzling divergence: the\ncreativity embodied in US patents has dropped dramatically over time. To\nseparate creative from derivative patents, I develop a novel, text-based,\nmeasure of patent creativity: the share of technical terminology that did not\nappear in previous patents. I show that only creative and not derivative\npatents are associated with significant improvements in firm level\nproductivity. Using the measure, I show that inventors on average file\ncreative patents upon entry, and file derivative patents with more experience.\nI embed this life-cycle of creativity in a growth model with endogenous\ncreation and imitation of technologies. In this model, falling population\ngrowth explains 27% of the observed decline in patent creativity, 30% of the\nslowdown in productivity growth, and 64% of the increase in patenting.\n\nKeywords: Creativity, innovation, productivity, patents, text-as-data,\ndemographics\n\nJEL Classification: O11, O31, O34, O47\n\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\n\nKalyani, Aakash, The Creativity Decline: Evidence from US Patents (March 12,\n2024).
