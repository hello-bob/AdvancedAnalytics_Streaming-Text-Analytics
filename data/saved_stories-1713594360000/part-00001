She was elected to the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives as a Republican from Montana in 1916 for one term, then was\nelected again in 1940. Rankin remains the only woman ever elected to Congress\nfrom Montana.^[1]^[2]\n\nEach of Rankin's congressional terms coincided with the initiation of U.S.\nmilitary intervention in one of the two world wars. A lifelong pacifist, she\nwas one of 50 House members who opposed the declaration of war on Germany in\n1917. In 1941, she was the sole member of Congress to vote against the\ndeclaration of war on Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nA suffragist during the Progressive Era, Rankin organized and lobbied for\nlegislation enfranchising women in several states, including Montana, New\nYork, and North Dakota. While in Congress, she introduced legislation that\neventually became the 19th Constitutional Amendment, granting unrestricted\nvoting rights to women nationwide. She championed a multitude of diverse\nwomen's rights and civil rights causes throughout a career that spanned more\nthan six decades.\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\nRankin was born on June 11, 1880, near Missoula in Montana Territory, nine\nyears before the territory became a state, to school teacher Olive (n\u00e9e\nPickering) and Scottish-Canadian immigrant John Rankin, a wealthy mill\nowner.^[3] She was the eldest of six children, including five sisters (one of\nwhom died in childhood) and a brother, Wellington, who became Montana's\nattorney general and later, a justice on the Montana Supreme Court.^[4]^[5]\nOne of her sisters, Edna Rankin McKinnon, became the first Montana-born woman\nto pass the bar exam in Montana and was an early social activist for access to\nbirth control.\n\nAs an adolescent on her family ranch, Rankin had many tasks, including\ncleaning, sewing, farm chores, outdoor work, and helping care for her younger\nsiblings. She helped maintain the ranch machinery and once single-handedly\nbuilt a wooden sidewalk for a building her father owned so it could be\nrented.^[6] Rankin later recorded her childhood observation that while women\nof the 1890s western frontier labored side by side as equals with men, they\ndid not have an equal political voice\u2014nor a legal right to vote.^[7]\n\nRankin graduated from high school in 1898. She studied at the University of\nMontana and, in 1902, received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology. Before\nher political and advocacy career, she explored a variety of careers,\nincluding dressmaking, furniture design, and teaching.^[7]^[8] After her\nfather died in 1904, Rankin took on the responsibility of caring for her\nyounger siblings.^[9]\n\n## Activism and suffrage movement[edit]\n\nJeannette Rankin, Representative from Montana\n\nAt the age of 27, Rankin moved to San Francisco to take a job in social work,\na new and developing field.^[1] Confident that she had found her calling, she\nenrolled in the New York School of Philanthropy in New York City^[a] from 1908\nto 1909.^[10] After a brief period as a social worker in Spokane,\nWashington,^[1] Rankin moved to Seattle to attend the University of\nWashington, and became involved in the women's suffrage movement. In November\n1910, Washington voters approved an amendment to their state constitution to\npermanently enfranchise women, the fifth state in the Union to do so.^[11]\nReturning to New York, Rankin became one of the organizers of the New York\nWoman Suffrage Party,^[12] which joined with other suffrage organizations to\npromote a similar suffrage bill in that state's legislature.^[13] During this\nperiod, Rankin also traveled to Washington to lobby Congress on behalf of the\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).^[3]^[13]\n\nRankin returned to Montana and rose through the ranks of suffrage\norganizations, becoming the president of the Montana Women's Suffrage\nAssociation and the national field secretary of NAWSA.^[14] In February 1911,\nshe became the first woman to speak before the Montana legislature, arguing in\nsupport of enfranchisement for women in her home state.^[15] In November 1914,\nMontana became the seventh state to grant women unrestricted voting\nrights.^[3]^[16] Rankin coordinated the efforts of a variety of grassroots\norganizations to promote her suffrage campaigns in New York and Montana (and\nlater in North Dakota as well).^[13] Later, she would draw from the same\ngrassroots infrastructure during her 1916 congressional campaign.^[17]\n\nRankin later compared her work in the women's suffrage movement to promoting\nthe pacifist foreign policy that defined her congressional career. She\nbelieved, as did many suffragists of the period, that the corruption and\ndysfunction of the United States government resulted from a lack of women's\nparticipation. At a disarmament conference during the interwar period, she\nsaid, \"The peace problem is a woman's problem.\"^[17]\n\nJeannette Rankin speaking from the balcony of the National American Woman\nSuffrage Association on April 2, 1917\u2014the same day that President Wilson\ndeclared, \"The world has to be made safe for democracy.\"\n\n## House of Representatives[edit]\n\n### First congressional term[edit]\n\nRankin's campaign for one of Montana's two at-large House seats in the\ncongressional election of 1916 was financed and managed by her brother\nWellington, an influential member of the Montana Republican Party. She\ntraveled long distances to reach the state's widely scattered population.\nRankin rallied support at train stations, street corners, potluck suppers on\nranches, and remote one-room schoolhouses.^[7] She ran as a progressive,\nemphasizing her support of suffrage, social welfare, and prohibition.^[3]^[18]\n\nIn the Republican primary, Rankin received the most votes of the eight\nRepublican candidates.^[19] In the at-large general election on November 7,\nthe top two vote-getters won the seats. Rankin finished second in the voting,\ndefeating Frank Bird Linderman, among others, to become the first woman\nelected to Congress.^[7]^[20]^[b] During her victory speech, she said, \"I am\ndeeply conscious of the responsibility resting upon me\" as the only woman in\nthe nation with voting power in Congress.^[3] Her election generated\nconsiderable nationwide interest, including, reportedly, several marriage\nproposals.^[21]\n\nShortly after her term began, Congress was called into an extraordinary April\nsession in response to Germany declaring unrestricted submarine warfare on all\nAtlantic shipping.^[3] On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson, addressing\na joint session, asked Congress to \"make the world safe for democracy\" by\ndeclaring war on Germany. After intense debate, the war resolution came to a\nvote in the House at 3:00 am on April 6;^[22] Rankin cast one of 50 votes in\nopposition. \"I wish to stand for my country,\" she said, \"but I cannot vote for\nwar.\"^[23] Years later, she would add, \"I felt the first time the first woman\nhad a chance to say no to war, she should say it.\"^[24] Although 49 male\nRepresentatives and six Senators also voted against the declaration, Rankin\nwas singled out for criticism.^[25] Some considered her vote a discredit to\nthe suffragist movement and her authority in Congress; but others applauded\nit, including Alice Paul of the National Woman's Party and Representative\nFiorello La Guardia of New York.^[3]\n\nRankin used her office to push for better working conditions for\nlaborers.^[26] On June 8, 1917, the Speculator Mine disaster in Butte left 168\nminers dead. Workers called a massive protest strike over working conditions.\nRankin tried to intervene, but mining companies refused to meet with her or\nthe miners, and her proposed legislation to end the strike was\nunsuccessful.^[15] She had greater success pushing for better working\nconditions in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Rankin listened to the\ngrievances of federal workers in the bureau, which included long hours and an\nexcessively demanding work pace. She hired investigative reporter Elizabeth\nWatson to investigate. As a result of her efforts to draw attention to the\nworking conditions of the bureau, Treasury Secretary William McAdoo convened\nhis own investigation and ultimately limited the work day to eight hours.^[26]\n\nBy 1917, women had been granted some form of voting rights in about forty\nstates. Rankin continued to lead the movement for unrestricted universal\nenfranchisement. She was instrumental in the creation of the Committee on\nWoman Suffrage and became one of its founding members.^[3] In January 1918,\nthe committee delivered its report to Congress,^[27] and Rankin opened\ncongressional debate on a Constitutional amendment granting universal suffrage\nto women. The resolution passed in the House but was defeated by the Senate.\nThe following year\u2014after Rankin's congressional term had ended\u2014the same\nresolution passed both chambers.^[c] After ratification by three-fourths of\nthe states, it became the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution.^[28]\n\nDuring Rankin's term, Montana's state legislature voted to replace the state's\ntwo at-large Congressional seats with two single-member districts.^[29] With\nlittle chance of reelection in the overwhelmingly Democratic western district,\nRankin chose instead to run for the Senate in 1918. After losing the\nRepublican primary to physician Oscar M. Lanstrum, she accepted the nomination\nof the National Party and finished third in the general election behind\nLanstrum and incumbent Democrat Thomas J. Walsh.^[15]\n\n### Between terms[edit]\n\nRankin arguing against the fortification of Guam before the House Naval\nAffairs Committee in 1939\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Rankin worked as a field secretary for the National\nConsumers League and as a lobbyist for various pacifist organizations. She\nargued for the passage of a Constitutional amendment banning child labor and\nsupported the Sheppard\u2013Towner Act, the first federal social welfare program\ncreated explicitly for women and children.^[3] The legislation was enacted in\n1921 but repealed eight years later,^[30] though many of its key provisions\nwere incorporated into the Social Security Act of 1935.^[31]\n\nIn 1924, Rankin bought a small farm in Georgia. She lived a simple life there,\nwithout electricity or plumbing,^[32] although she also maintained a residence\nin Montana.^[33] Rankin made frequent speeches around the country on behalf of\nthe Women's Peace Union and the National Council for the Prevention of War\n(NCPW). In 1928 she founded the Georgia Peace Society, which served as\nheadquarters for her pacifism campaign until its dissolution in 1941, on the\neve of the U.S. involvement in World War II.^[7]\n\nIn 1937, Rankin opposed President Franklin Roosevelt's proposals to intervene\non the British side against Germany and its allies, arguing that both sides\nwished to avoid a second European war and would pursue a diplomatic solution.\nShe testified before multiple Congressional committees in opposition to\nvarious preparedness measures. When it became clear that her lobbying efforts\nwere largely ineffective, Rankin resigned from her NCPW position and declared\nher intention to regain her seat in the House of Representatives.^[33]\n\n### Second congressional term[edit]\n\nJeannette Rankin\n\nRankin began her campaign for Congress in 1939 with a tour of high schools in\nMontana. She arranged to speak in 52 of the First Congressional District's 56\nhigh schools to reestablish her ties to the region after years of spending\nmuch of her time in Georgia. Once again, Rankin enjoyed the political support\nof her well connected brother Wellington, even though the siblings had\nincreasingly divergent lifestyles and political views.^[34]\n\nIn the 1940 race, Rankin\u2014at age 60\u2014defeated incumbent Jacob Thorkelson, an\noutspoken antisemite, in the July primary,^[35] and former Representative\nJerry J. O'Connell in the general election.^[36] She was appointed to the\nCommittee on Public Lands and the Committee on Insular Affairs. While members\nof Congress and their constituents had been debating the question of U.S.\nintervention in World War II for months, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\non December 7, 1941, galvanized the country and silenced virtually all\nopposition.^[15]\n\nOn December 8, Rankin was the only member of either chamber of Congress to\nvote against the declaration of war on Japan.^[37] Hisses could be heard in\nthe gallery as she cast her vote; several colleagues, including Rep. (later\nSenator) Everett Dirksen, asked her to change it to make the resolution\nunanimous\u2014or at very least, to abstain\u2014but she refused. \"As a woman I can't go\nto war,\" she said, \"and I refuse to send anyone else.\"^[38]\n\nAfter the vote, a crowd of reporters pursued Rankin into a cloakroom. There,\nshe was forced to take refuge in a phone booth until Capitol Police arrived to\nescort her to her office,^[39]^[40] where she was inundated with angry\ntelegrams and phone calls. One cable from her brother read, \"Montana is 100\npercent against you\".^[41] A wire-service photo of Rankin sequestered in the\nphone booth, calling for assistance, appeared the following day in newspapers\nacross the country.^[42]^[43]\n\nWhile her action was widely ridiculed in the press, Progressive leader William\nAllen White, writing in the Kansas Emporia Gazette, acknowledged her courage\nin taking it:\n\n> Probably a hundred men in Congress would have liked to do what she did. Not\n> one of them had the courage to do it. The Gazette entirely disagrees with\n> the wisdom of her position. But Lord, it was a brave thing! And its bravery\n> someway discounted its folly. When, in a hundred years from now, courage,\n> sheer courage based upon moral indignation is celebrated in this country,\n> the name of Jeannette Rankin, who stood firm in folly for her faith, will be\n> written in monumental bronze\u2013 not for what she did but for the way she did\n> it.^[44]^[45]\n\nThree days later, a similar war declaration against Germany and Italy came to\na vote; Rankin abstained. With her political career effectively over, she did\nnot run for reelection in 1942.^[7] Asked years later if she ever regretted\nher action, Rankin replied, \"Never. If you're against war, you're against war\nregardless of what happens. It's a wrong method of trying to settle a\ndispute.\"^[46]^[47] John F. Kennedy would write about Rankin's decisions, \"Few\nmembers of Congress have ever stood more alone while being true to a higher\nhonor and loyalty.\"^[48]\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\nOver the next twenty years, Rankin traveled the world, frequently visiting\nIndia, where she studied the pacifist teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.^[49] She\nmaintained homes in both Georgia and Montana.^[3]\n\nRankin in 1973\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, a new generation of pacifists, feminists, and civil\nrights advocates found inspiration in Rankin and embraced her efforts in ways\nthat her generation had not. She mobilized again in response to the Vietnam\nWar. In January 1968, the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, a coalition of women's\npeace groups, organized an anti-war march in Washington, D.C.\u2014the largest\nmarch by women since the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913.^[50] Rankin led 5,000\nparticipants from Union Station to the steps of the Capitol Building, where\nthey presented a peace petition to House Speaker John McCormack.^[3]^[15]\nSimultaneously, a splinter group of activists from the women's liberation\nmovement created a protest within the Brigade's protest by staging a \"Burial\nof True Womanhood\" at Arlington National Cemetery to draw attention to the\npassive role allotted to women as wives and mothers.^[51] In 1972, Rankin\u2014by\nthen in her nineties\u2014considered mounting a third House campaign to gain a\nwider audience for her opposition to the Vietnam War,^[3] but longstanding\nthroat and heart ailments forced her to abandon that final project.^[52]\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\nRankin never married and never had children. Rankin's biographers generally\nagree that she was too consumed by her work to pursue committed personal\nrelationships.^[53]\n\n## Death and legacy[edit]\n\nRankin's monument in the National Statuary Hall, Washington, D.C., by Terry\nMimnaugh (1985)\n\nRankin died on May 18, 1973, at age 92, in Carmel, California.^[54] There is a\nmemorial stone dedicated to her in the Missoula Cemetery.^[55] She bequeathed\nher estate, including the property in Watkinsville, Georgia, to help \"mature,\nunemployed women workers\". Her Montana residence, known as the Rankin Ranch,\nwas added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.^[12]^[56] The\nJeannette Rankin Foundation (Jeannette Rankin Women's Scholarship Fund), a\n501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, awards annual educational scholarships to\nlow-income women 35 and older across the United States.^[57] Beginning with a\nsingle $500 scholarship in 1978, the fund has since awarded more than $1.8\nmillion in scholarships to more than 700 women.^[58]\n\nA statue of Rankin by Terry Mimnaugh, inscribed \"I Cannot Vote For War\", was\nplaced in the United States Capitol's Statuary Hall in 1985. At its\ndedication, historian Joan Hoff-Wilson called Rankin \"one of the most\ncontroversial and unique women in Montana and American political\nhistory\".^[38] A replica stands in Montana's capitol building in Helena.^[7]\nIn 1993, Rankin was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.^[59]\n\nIn 2004, peace activist Jeanmarie Simpson produced and starred in the one-\nwoman play A Single Woman, based on the life of Rankin, to benefit peace\norganizations.^[60] Simpson also starred in a film adaptation that was\ndirected and produced by Kamala Lopez, narrated by Martin Sheen, and featuring\nmusic by Joni Mitchell.^[61]\n\nOpera America commissioned a song cycle about Rankin called Fierce Grace that\npremiered in 2017.^[62] In 2018, the Kalispell Brewing Company commissioned a\nmural on the side of its building in Kalispell, Montana, featuring a Rankin\ncaricature and quotation.^[63]\n\nRankin is the subject of the musical We Won't Sleep (formerly Jeannette) with\nmusic and lyrics by Arianna Afsar and a book by Lauren Gunderson. Under the\ntitle Jeannette, the musical was part of the 2019 summer series at the\nNational Music Theater Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in\nConnecticut.^[64]\n\nAlthough her legacy rests almost entirely on her pacifism, Rankin told the\nMontana Constitutional Convention in 1972 that she would have preferred\notherwise. \"If I am remembered for no other act\", she said, \"I want to be\nremembered as the only woman who ever voted to give women the right to\nvote.\"^[38]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * History of the Republican Party (United States)\n  * List of peace activists\n  * Women's International League for Peace and Freedom\n  * Women in the United States House of Representatives\n  * Barbara Lee, the only member of Congress to vote against American military response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks\n  * A Single Woman (2004 play)\n  * A Single Woman (2008 film)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ The school later became part of Columbia University School of Social Work\n  2. ^ Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution requires a representative to live in the \"state in which he shall be chosen.\" In spite of the use of a male pronoun in the Constitution, the House of Representatives decides for itself whether someone is qualified to become a Member, and Rankin was seated without an issue.^[21]\n  3. ^ No woman was serving in Congress when the resolution that would become the 19th Amendment passed. Rankin would later point out that she was, therefore, \"the only woman who ever voted to give women the right to vote\".^[21]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Greenspan, Jesse (November 2, 2016). \"7 Things You May Not Know About Jeannette Rankin \u2013 History Lists\".
