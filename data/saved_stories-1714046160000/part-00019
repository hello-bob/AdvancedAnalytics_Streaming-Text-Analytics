(Airman Keagan Lee/U.S. Air\nForce)\n\nIn February 2017, then-Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Dave Goldfein issued a\nwarning.\n\nSpeaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,\nGoldfein rattled off all the missions the Air Force must undertake: defending\nthe U.S. against attack, operating two legs of the nation\u2019s nuclear triad,\nprojecting air power around the globe and, at the time, defeating the militant\ngroup known as the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cEvery one of those missions is a growth area,\u201d Goldfein said. \u201cAnd while\nthese missions have been growing, our Air Force has been getting smaller. ...\nWe\u2019re actually the smallest Air Force we\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the service had about 5,500 aircraft in its inventory. Since\nthen, it has shrunk further and is now on track to get smaller still.\n\nThe Air Force expects its fleet of fighters, bombers, tankers, cargo planes,\ndrones and other aircraft to dip below 5,000 in fiscal 2025, as retirements of\nolder, worn down and outdated airframes outpace procurement of their\nreplacements. Indeed, the fleet could drop to 4,903 total aircraft next year,\nbut it may yet fall further.\n\n\u201cRight now, the Air Force is as big as it will be,\u201d Maj. Gen. Dave Tabor,\ndirector of programs for the service\u2019s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for\nPlans and Programs, said in a March 21 interview. \u201cIn light of the budget\nuncertainties, it\u2019s really difficult to predict exactly what size [the fleet]\nwill be, next year or five years from now.\u201d\n\nThe fleet already totals less than one-fifth of its size during its fiscal\n1956 peak, when the service had 26,104 aircraft, according to the Mitchell\nInstitute for Aerospace Studies. During that period, the number of F-84\nThunderjet and F-86 Sabre fighters alone exceeded 6,400, far greater than the\nAir Force\u2019s entire combined fleet of 5,032 airframes in fiscal 2024.\n\nFour F-15E Strike Eagles fly by an F-86 Sabre on display during a 2016 even in\nGoldsboro, N.C. (Airman 1st Class Ashley Williamson/U.S. Air Force)\n\nThe workforce is smaller as well. The Air Force in fiscal 2025 aims to fall to\n320,000 active duty jobs, dropping by about 13,000 billets over the previous\nfive fiscal years. The roles of those airmen are shifting, too, as the service\ntries to bolster non-flying missions like cyber offense and defense that are\nkey to modern warfare.\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s fleet is now 52% bigger than the Navy and Marine Corps\u2019\ncombined inventory of 3,308 aircraft.\n\nThe current Air Force chief of staff, Gen. David Allvin, and other top service\nofficials point to exponential increases in capability among the remaining\naircraft \u2014 such as striking targets with firepower and precision far beyond\nthat of previous generations \u2014 to assuage concerns over the declining number\nof aircraft.\n\nBut the shrinking fleet worries some lawmakers and observers.\n\nTodd Harrison, a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute think\ntank, said that while modern aircraft do offer more speed, range, stealth and\nother advantages over previous generations of technology, \u201cthe reality is that\none plane can only be in one place at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the credibility of our deterrence and our force posture, size still\nmatters,\u201d Harrison told Defense News. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re coming up short.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn F-35 deployed over in the Indo-Pacific region is not doing anything to\nhelp you in [Europe],\u201d he added.\n\nHeather Penney, a former F-16 pilot and senior resident fellow at the Mitchell\nInstitute for Aerospace Studies, said the Air Force\u2019s fleet dipping below\n5,000 is \u201cabsolutely a noteworthy number,\u201d with worrying implications for\nnational security and the service\u2019s ability to project power. Once it drops\nbelow that mark, she said, it will be harder for the service to argue in favor\nof bringing it back up.\n\n\u201cThe Air Force has reached a critical danger point in my mind regarding its\ncapacity and ability to fulfill what the nation expects of it, and what the\nother services depend on,\u201d Penney said.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t limited to the service\u2019s strike assets. Lawmakers routinely\nraise concerns about whether commanders around the globe will lose vital\nrefueling, reconnaissance, battlefield coordination and more capabilities as\nthe Air Force phases out high-demand fleets. Congress has even barred the\nservice from retiring certain airframes until the military proves it can\novercome those capability gaps.\n\nIn an April 9 hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee\u2019s defense\npanel, ranking member Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed her own concerns\ngiven the geopolitical environment. She pointed to Ukraine\u2019s experience over\nthe last two years \u2014 fighting off Russia\u2019s invasion with a paltry fleet of a\nfew dozen fighters \u2014 and questioned whether the U.S. Air Force will have\nenough aircraft to counter and deter threats across the globe.\n\n\u201cIt seems clear to me that not only is quality obviously extremely important,\nand capability, but quantity matters also, particularly when we\u2019re facing as\nmany threats in such diverse places as we are,\u201d she said.\n\n## The trade-offs\n\nToday\u2019s Air Force fleet, while smaller, can carry out missions like precision-\nguided airstrikes and electronic warfare operations that generals during World\nWar II and the Korean War could only dream of. Tabor said that ability allows\nthe service to \u201chedge a little bit\u201d on its capacity.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, other branches of the U.S. military and America\u2019s allied and\npartner nations in some cases have capabilities similar to the Air Force,\nTabor added, potentially making it easier to cover more regions.\n\nAdvancements in precision targeting have rendered obsolete the mid-20th\ncentury tactics of sending wave after wave of first- and second-generation\nbombers against a target, raining down scores of munitions with the hope that\none will hit the mark. Instead, a single B-2 Spirit \u2014 or even in years to\ncome, an in-the-works B-21 Raider, touted by manufacturer Northrop Grumman as\nthe first sixth-generation aircraft \u2014 can travel long distances and destroy a\ntarget that previously would have required multiple fighters and bombers\nworking in concert.\n\nImprovements in range, coupled with the stealth capabilities of the F-35 Joint\nStrike Fighter, F-22 Raptor, B-2 and the eventual B-21, have also\nrevolutionized the Air Force\u2019s ability to safely hit targets worldwide. And\nleaps forward in satellite technology, among other platforms that provide\nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, have reduced the need for spy\nplanes that once streaked across hostile airspace at Mach speed, snapping\nphotos along the way.\n\nThe Air Force plans to retire 250 aircraft in FY25, which would exceed the\nnumber of aircraft it plans to bring on, resulting in a reduction of 129\naircraft.\n\nThose old and outdated aircraft slated for retirement include the A-10\nThunderbolt II and older F-15 Eagle fighters, which the service believes would\nnot be suited for a war against an advanced adversary such as China. The\nservice is also eyeing some F-22s for retirement, among other aircraft types,\ngiven they would cost too much to prepare for combat. The service expects its\ndownsizing measures will free up money and resources for more modern aircraft.\n\n\u201cThey were phenomenal aircraft in their time,\u201d Tabor said of the A-10 and\nF-15C. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go very far to find someone who will talk about the\neffects of A-10s on the battlefield. But the reality is, they\u2019re simply no\nlonger viable in today\u2019s fight, and certainly not in tomorrow\u2019s \u2014 particularly\nat the cost associated with keeping them.\u201d\n\nAn airman directs an A-10 Thunderbolt II pilot to a parking location on Oct.\n27, 2023, within U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, which spans\nnortheast Africa and across the Middle East to Central and South Asia.\n(Courtesy of the U.S. Air Force)\n\nThe Air Force also wants to dial back its planned purchase of F-35A and F-15EX\nEagle II fighters, as it focuses its spending in FY25 on the research and\ndevelopment of future advanced aircraft, such as the Next Generation Air\nDominance program. That effort seeks to craft an even more capable fighter,\nplus artificial intelligence-powered drones known as collaborative combat\naircraft.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re forced to make a choice between two things: We can either maintain\nlegacy force structure, and ultimately what that means is maintaining units\nand maintaining basing in any location that you want to pick, or modernizing,\u201d\naccording to the deputy chief of staff for plans and programs, Lt. Gen.\nRichard Moore. \u201cUnfortunately, what\u2019s happening is we\u2019re trying to do both.\u201d\n\nBut congressional reluctance about the Air Force\u2019s planned retirements have\nprevented the service from shifting to the modernization effort it wants, he\nsaid in April at an Air and Space Forces Association event.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being restricted from divesting legacy force structure,\u201d Moore said,\nadding that the service is \u201chaving to slow down modernization.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one reason the Air Force struck six F-35As and six F-15EXs from its\nplanned purchase in FY25, he noted, as well as reducing its buy of MH-139 Grey\nWolf patrol helicopters.\n\n\u201cTo maintain legacy force structure and try and modernize, we\u2019re hollowing out\nthe force,\u201d Moore said.\n\n## \u2018Modernization death spiral\u2019\n\nHarrison, the analyst at AEI, said the fleet\u2019s reduction is similar to that\noccurring among other armed services, even as defense budgets grow larger each\nyear. Much of those budgetary increases go to rising costs for personnel,\noperations and maintenance, he added.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got recruiting and retention challenges, your force becomes more\nexpensive,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got older aircraft still in the\ninventory \u2014 KC-135 [tankers], B-52s that are older than 90% of the people in\nthe Air Force \u2014 those are going to cost more to operate and maintain as they\nage. When you replace those old systems, those advanced aircraft often cost\neven more to operate and maintain.\u201d\n\nBudgetary restrictions are also pinching the Air Force; Congress last year\npassed the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which capped the Defense Department\u2019s\nFY25 budget and forced the Air Force \u201cto make some hard choices,\u201d service\nSecretary Frank Kendall said, such as buying fewer F-35s and F-15EXs.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force's two experimental F-15EX Eagle II fighters return from a\ntest mission over the Gulf of Mexico on Aug. 2, 2023. (Tech. Sgt. John\nMcRell/U.S. Air Force)\n\nIn addition, a long-overdue \u201cbow wave\u201d of modernization is crashing down as\nthe Air Force seeks to simultaneously upgrade its fighters, bombers, tankers\nand intercontinental ballistic missiles, Harrison said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to continue all of these new development programs,\u201d Harrison\nsaid. \u201cThe reality is, it\u2019s just squeezing the budget, and there\u2019s not at much\nleft at the end to procure these things in quantity.\u201d\n\nOver the last two decades, Penney said, the Air Force\u2019s modernization\nrequirements took a backseat to the need to fund the wars in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. During this time, the service heavily flew aircraft such as the\nB-1B Lancer, curtailed the F-22 program earlier than expected, and delayed an\neffort to build a new bomber that eventually became the B-21 Raider.\n\n\u201cThat forced the Air Force into ... all these service-life extensions, and\nlimping along [with] the fleet that it had until it got [to] today, where\neverything\u2019s breaking at the same time,\u201d Penney said.\n\n\u201cIt is a crisis that we should have anticipated,\u201d she added. \u201cThe Air Force\nneeds to not only recapitalize, but it has to grow its force, and the demand\nsignal on it is enormous.\u201d\n\nThe result, Harrison said, is that the Air Force is in danger of falling into\na \u201cmaintenance and modernization death spiral.\u201d\n\nIn such a spiral, he explained, the fleet is aging, stretched thin and in dire\nneed of modernization. Because the service has to keep its existing fleet\nflying \u2014 to avoid a capabilities gap \u2014 it must spend its limited money on\nmaintaining and extending the life of those older aircraft. But then, he\nadded, the Air Force has less money to buy the new replacement planes it\nsorely needs.\n\n\u201cHow do you pull out of a death spiral?\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge\nfor the Air Force over the rest of this decade.\u201d\n\nAnd as the number of planes in the Air Force decreases, Penney said, the\nservice may struggle to retain experienced pilots. If they aren\u2019t getting the\ncockpit time they need because there aren\u2019t enough planes, she added, they\nmight leave and take higher-paying jobs in the private aviation industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a slippery slope that the Air Force is already in because ... they just\ncan\u2019t retain pilots,\u201d Penney said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pilots, it\u2019s the maintainers,\nit\u2019s the [logistics airmen], it\u2019s the intel ops [at risk of leaving the Air\nForce]. The entire ecosystem that surrounds a combat capability \u2014 you lose all\nof that knowledge.\u201d\n\nHarrison said the upcoming drop below 5,000 aircraft worries him less than the\npattern it represents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the trend line that matters, more so than the absolute number itself,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cAnd the trend line is not sustainable.\u201d\n\nAbout Stephen Losey\n\nStephen Losey is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.
