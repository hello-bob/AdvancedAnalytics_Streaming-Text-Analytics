You can thank Tailwind\nfor that.\n\nSince its release in 2017 it\u2019s become a favorite CSS framework among devs. And\nit\u2019s currently used by companies like OpenAI, Shopify, Netflix, and basically\nevery indie developer.\n\nBut what is it?\n\nTailwind is a CSS framework. At its core it\u2019s just one big CSS file with pre-\nbuilt classes. But it\u2019s unique in that the classes are utility classes.\nMeaning each class does one thing.\n\nIn traditional CSS, you define classes that hold a bunch of attributes \u2013 like\ncolor, size, what happens on hover etc. And you assign a chunk of html to that\nclass.\n\nIn utility classes, each class has a single job. For example the text-white\nclass will turn the text color white. And then you string together these\nutility classes in HTML to get the look and behavior you want.\n\n## How it started\n\nAdam Wathan, the guy behind Tailwind, was building other companies from\n2015-2017. He built them in public, either through tweeting or live streaming.\n\nOne of them was called KiteTail (Tailwind was actually named from). The\nproduct died, but his followers would keep asking him to open source the CSS\nsystem he used.\n\n(Adam has said if it wasn\u2019t for building in public tailwind wouldn\u2019t exist!)\n\nEventually he did open source and release it, and the reception was\nphenomenal. In its first year it got 670k installs, 8k Github stars, and 10k\nfollowers.\n\nThat\u2019s what we in the biz like to call \u201creally fast growth\u201d.\n\n## Business Model\n\nAt it\u2019s core Tailwind UI\u2014the commercial arm of Tailwind\u2014is a product business.\nThey sell a digital product. Similar to a course, or a book.\n\nTheir strategy is pretty textbook for open source software:\n\n#### 1\\. Create open source software that gains large adoption\n\nKeep it open source to gain trust and adoption. Make the software as robust as\nyou can, and get the community involved. Active contributors will become\nadvocates for it, spurring on more adoption.\n\n#### 2\\. Become an authority figure on the software\n\nThis should be easy, since you built it.\n\n#### 3\\. Sell\n\nThere are a 4 common ways open source software can monetize these days. Two of\nthe more popular ones are:\n\nSelling templates\n\nThis is a classic move for frontend OSS. You offer premium code templates that\nbuild on your framework. For example, Bootstrap, Material-UI, and others have\nbeen doing this long before Tailwind.\n\nIt\u2019s basically a freemium model \u2013 the basics are free, and advanced stuff is\nextra.\n\nIn the open source world they call it \u201cOpen Core\u201d \u2013 the core of the code is\nfree, advanced usage of it is premium.\n\nSelling hosting services\n\nThis is how companies like Mongo DB, Vercel, Redis have become profitable. By\nbeing experts in the software, you\u2019re well positioned to create hosting\nsolutions tailor-made for that software.\n\nThis is a more complex route to take, but can be far more profitable if\nenterprises start to build and use your hosting service. For example MongoDB\u2019s\nrevenue is a whopping $458M.\n\nThe major ways OSS monetizes (not including things like sponsorships,\ndonations etc)\n\nTailwind uses the \u201cOpen-Core\u201d model and charges a one time fee of $300 to\naccess all premium components and templates.\n\nSo how profitable has this been for them?\n\nIn their first 2 years they earned $2 million. And that was in 2020. They\nhaven\u2019t reported revenue since, but with an increasing user base, it\u2019s a safe\nbet their revenue has grown too.\n\n## Now\n\nThe team has grown to 6 members. And they\u2019re focused on improving the software\nusability and speed.\n\nAs Adam puts it, the nice profitability has allowed the team to enjoy their\nwork and maintain a good work-life balance.\n\nSo, it\u2019s safe to say things are going pretty well for the Tailwind crew.\n\n### Time to level up.
