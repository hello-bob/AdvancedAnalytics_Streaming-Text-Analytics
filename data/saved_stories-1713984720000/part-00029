You can access the standard here.\n\nAs an active contributor to the development of GQL standard version 1, I\u2019ve\nwitnessed the entire journey from its inception to its high-quality final\npublication. I can attest that this marks a significant milestone in the\nhistory of databases. Thanks to the GQL editor Stefan Plantikow and Stephen\nCannan, editing tooling support from Jim Melton, the convenor of WG3 Keith\nHare, and the original author of the GQL manifesto Alastair Green. This\nelegant standard is developed with a strong international team including both\nacademia and industry query language experts. A non-exhaustive contributor\nlist can be found on these two SIGMOD papers 1, 2.\n\nIn this blog, I\u2019m going to share my personal enthusiasm on GQL and invite you\nto start learning it.\n\n### What is GQL?\n\nGQL, or Graph Query Language, is an ISO standard defined for property graph\ndatabases. It stands as the first sibling database language emerging from the\nISO standard committee for databases since the initial publication of the SQL\nstandard in 1986.\n\nGQL aims to become the de facto query language standard for property graph\ndatabases, addressing the growing demand for such databases.\n\nLet\u2019s revisit some background knowledge on property graph databases.\n\nFirstly, property graph databases utilize property graph data modeling, where\nvertices and edges serve as the fundamental units to represent data elements.\nIn contrast, the traditional relational data model relies on tables for data\nrepresentation. Intuitively, the property graph model offers greater\nflexibility and aligns more closely with real-world interactions between\nobjects.\n\nSecondly, there are various storage formats tailored to support the property\ngraph data model. Native graph databases distinguish themselves from non-\nnative counterparts primarily through their storage format. In a native graph\ndatabase, vertices and edges are treated as first-class citizens within the\nstorage layer, resulting in superior performance, particularly in path\ntraversal and iterative graph algorithms. This performance boost stems from\nthe native graph database\u2019s inherent structure as a gigantic object index.\nDuring graph traversal, one navigates from an active vertex set to another via\ntheir connecting edges, circumventing the need for costly runtime joins (as\nrelational databases do) to reconnect data elements. In my opinion, native\ngraph database\u2019s graph storage format is the key differentiator to other\ndatabases. TigerGraph falls in the category of native graph database.\n\n### Why GQL and Why Now?\n\nAs the graph database industry evolves, it becomes the third canonical\ndatabase, alongside relational databases and key-value store databases. In the\npast decade, the burgeoning graph database industry has witnessed a plethora\nof vendors offering their own graph database products, each accompanied by\ntheir proprietary graph query language. Examples include Neo4j\u2019s Cypher,\nTigerGraph\u2019s GSQL, Oracle\u2019s PGQ, LDBC\u2019s G-core, and Gremlin, among others. For\na comprehensive overview of the graph query language landscape, I recommend\nreferring to Peter Boncz\u2019s insightful survey slide from CWI.\n\nAmidst this thriving ecosystem, GQL emerged to address the growing demand for\na standardized graph query language. Its publication establishes a solid\nfoundation and drives the prosperity of graph databases in the coming years,\nakin to what SQL did for relational databases\n\n### Scratching the GQL Surface\n\nAt its core, GQL uses pattern matching syntax to declaratively ask queries\nagainst graph databases, similar to SQL for relational databases.\n\nThe building blocks of a pattern are (1) vertex pattern and (2) edge pattern,\nillustrated below.\n\n  * MATCH (x:Account WHERE x.isBlocked=\u2019no\u2019)\n\n    * x binds to a vertex in the graph. () is a node pattern.\n  * MATCH \u2212[e:Transfer WHERE e.amount>5M]\u2212>\n\n    * e binds to an edge in the graph. -[]-> is an edge pattern.\n\nWith the above building blocks, you can have a longer pattern by alternating\nthe node and edge patterns.\n\n  * MATCH (x:Account)-[:SignInWithIP]->(y:IP) -[:Associated]->(p:Phone)\n\nEach matched pattern provides a table. You can filter, group by, aggregate,\nand project the columns of the table, as you do in SQL.\n\nGQL has two syntax flavors: one is Cypher, and the other is SQL. However, both\nflavors share the same core pattern matching part.\n\nIf you\u2019re coming from the SQL world, you\u2019ll use something like this.\n\n  * SELECT x.age, y.ip FROM g MATCH (x:Account)-[:SignInWithIP]-(y:IP) WHERE x.name == \u201cJohn\u201d\n\nNote: TigerGraph is the main contributor and advocate for the SQL flavor in\nGQL because we firmly believe that SQL users will have a much easier time\nlearning GQL with the SQL dialect.\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the Cypher world, you\u2019ll use something like the\nexample below.\n\n  * MATCH (x:Account)-[:SignInWithIP]-(y:IP) WHERE x.name == \u201cJohn\u201d RETURN x.age, y.ip\n\nFurthermore, GQL supports linear composition of pattern match statements,\nmeaning that each MATCH statement\u2019s generated result table columns can be used\nto drive the next MATCH statement. This linear composition can be illustrated\nby the two flavors:\n\n  * SQL flavor\n\n{\n\nSELECT expression_list FROM g MATCH graph_pattern1 WHERE xxx\n\nNEXT\n\nSELECT expression_list FROM g MATCH graph_pattern2 WHERE yyy\n\nNEXT\n\nSELECT expression_list FROM g MATCH graph_pattern3 WHERE zzz\n\n}\n\n  * Cypher flavor\n\n{\n\nUSE g MATCH graph_pattern1 WHERE xxx YIELD expression_list\n\nNEXT\n\nUSE g MATCH graph_pattern2 WHERE yyy YIELD expression_list\n\nNEXT\n\nUSE g MATCH graph_pattern2 WHERE zzz RETURN expression_list\n\n}\n\nBesides the query syntax, GQL also supports a Linux file system-style\ndirectory hierarchy to host graph schemas and their catalog objects. This\nphysical design of the catalog layout is to adapt to the flexibility of two-\nlevel property graph modeling, where a graph is a logical container and\nvertices and edges are the base containers. This design was initially\ninformally discussed between TigerGraph and Neo4j, as we were first inspired\nby our multi-graph modeling product offering\u2014multiple graphs can share a\nsubset of the base vertex and edge containers. After multi-round constructive\ndiscussions, we agree that graph schemas will evolve freely under this catalog\nlayout, especially for cross graph sharing and joining.\n\nThere are many other gems in the GQL standard; interested readers can purchase\nand study the standard.\n\n### How To Learn It?\n\nMany TigerGraph users have asked me how to learn GQL or have an early peek.\nHere is my suggested approach for a quick ramp-up:\n\n  1. Study the core pattern matching design: get familiar with the Pattern Match syntax by reading this SIGMOD paper. It lays the foundation for understanding pattern matching nuances and design philosophy.\n  2. Study existing LDBC-SNB BI benchmark queries written in Cypher and GSQL. They bear many similarities to GQL syntax.\n  3. Dive into the Standard: read the 628-page ISO GQL standard (cost: 217 CHF) for a comprehensive understanding of the language\u2019s specifications.\n\nLast and the most important thing, start writing!\n\n### What\u2019s Next for GQL?\n\nGQL version 1 marks just the beginning of an ongoing journey. As the industry\nevolves, there are still challenges to address, including graph view support,\ntrigger support, enhanced graph algorithm capabilities, and join graphs and\ntables, among others. At TigerGraph, we\u2019re actively implementing GQL to\nchampion this standard, maintaining our unwavering commitment to both\nopenCypher and GQL.\n\nReflecting on our journey, Alin Deutsch, Yu Xu, and I began inventing GSQL in\nthe summer of 2015 in Mountain View, CA, drawing inspiration from both the SQL\nstandard and pattern matching literature. Alin and I implemented the initial\nversion of GSQL that summer, burning many night candles. Throughout this\nprocess, we\u2019ve contributed our best practices and real-world experiences back\nto the ISO GQL standard. We\u2019re continuing this journey with the ISO standard\ncommittee, actively shaping the future versions of GQL. Along the way, we\u2019ve\nforged numerous friendships within the global graph community, collectively\ndelivering this beautiful standard. We hope you\u2019ll recognize the dedication\nand passion this community has poured into this endeavor and take the time to\nlearn, appreciate the design, and, most importantly, start using it.\n\nIn conclusion, GQL represents a significant leap forward in standardizing\ngraph query languages. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned database professional or new\nto graph databases, now is the time to start learning GQL and embrace the\nfuture of graph data management. Stay tuned for exciting developments in the\nworld of GQL!\n\nIf you want to learn more about TigerGraph and GQL contact us at\ninfo@tigergraph.com.\n\n## You Might Also Like\n\n#### Creating LLM-Friendly Definitions for TigerGraph CoPilot\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n#### Understanding Graph Embeddings\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\n#### Enhanced Data Analytics: Integrating NVIDIA Rapids...\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\n### Introducing TigerGraph 3.0\n\nJuly 1, 2020\n\n### Everything to Know to Pass your TigerGraph Certification Test\n\nJune 24, 2020\n\n### Neo4j 4.0 Fabric \u2013 A Look Behind the Curtain\n\nFebruary 7, 2020\n\n### Mingxi Wu\n\n# TigerGraph Blog\n\n* Categories\n\n  * blogs\n\n    * About TigerGraph\n    * Benchmark\n    * Business\n    * Community\n    * Compliance\n    * Customer\n    * Customer 360\n    * Cybersecurity\n    * Developers\n    * Digital Twin\n    * eCommerce\n    * Emerging Use Cases\n    * Engineers\n    * Entity Resolution\n    * Finance\n    * Fraud / Anti-Money Laundering\n    * GQL\n    * Graph Database Market\n    * Graph Databases\n    * GSQL\n    * Healthcare\n    * Machine Learning / AI\n    * Podcast\n    * Supply Chain\n    * TigerGraph\n    * TigerGraph Cloud\n  * Graph AI On Demand\n\n    * Analysts and Research\n    * Customer 360 and Entity Resolution\n    * Customer Spotlight\n    * Development\n    * Finance, Banking, Insurance\n    * Graph + AI\n    * Graph Algorithms\n    * Keynote\n    * Session\n  * RulesEngine\n  * Video\n\n#### Recent Posts\n\n  * The Rise of GQL: A New ISO Standard in Graph Query Language\n  * Creating LLM-Friendly Definitions for TigerGraph CoPilot\n  * Understanding Graph Embeddings\n  * Enhanced Data Analytics: Integrating NVIDIA Rapids cuGraph with TigerGraph\n  * TigerGraph CoPilot Enters Public Alpha Release\n\n#### Product\n\n#### SOLUTIONS\n\n#### customers\n\n#### RESOURCES\n\n#### start for free\n\n###### TIGERGRAPH DB\n\n  * Overview\n  * Features\n  * GSQL Query Language\n\n###### GRAPH DATA SCIENCE\n\n  * Graph Data Science Library\n  * Machine Learning Workbench\n\n###### TIGERGRAPH CLOUD\n\n  * Overview\n  * Cloud Starter Kits\n  * Login\n  * FAQ\n  * Pricing\n  * Cloud Marketplaces\n\n###### USEr TOOLS\n\n  * GraphStudio\n  * TigerGraph Insights\n  * Application Workbenches\n  * Connectors and Drivers\n  * Starter Kits\n  * openCypher Support\n\n###### SOLUTIONS\n\n  * Why Graph?\n\n###### industry\n\n  * Advertising, Media & Entertainment\n  * Financial Services\n  * Healthcare & Life Sciences\n\n###### use cases\n\n  * Benefits\n  * Product & Service Marketing\n  * Entity Resolution\n  * Customer 360/MDM\n  * Recommendation Engine\n  * Anti-Money Laundering\n  * Cybersecurity Threat Detection\n  * Fraud Detection\n  * Risk Assessment & Monitoring\n  * Energy Management\n  * Network & IT Management\n  * Supply Chain Analysis\n  * AI & Machine Learning\n  * Geospatial Analysis\n  * Time Series Analysis\n\n###### success stories\n\n  * Customer Success Stories\n\n#### Partners\n\n###### Partner program\n\n  * Partner Benefits\n  * TigerGraph Partners\n  * Sign Up\n\n###### LIBRARY\n\n  * Resources\n  * Benchmark\n  * Webinars\n\n###### Events\n\n  * Trade Shows\n  * Graph + AI Summit\n  * Million Dollar Challenge\n\n###### EDUCATION\n\n  * Training & Certifications\n\n###### Blog\n\n  * TigerGraph Blog\n\n###### DEVELOPERS\n\n  * Developers Hub\n  * Community Forum\n  * Documentation\n  * Ecosystem\n\n#### COMPANY\n\n###### Company\n\n  * Overview\n  * Careers\n  * News\n  * Press Release\n  * Awards\n  * Legal Terms\n  * Patents\n  * Security and Compliance\n  * Contact\n\n###### Get Started\n\n  * Start Free\n  * Compare Editions\n  * Online Demo - Test Drive\n  * Request a Demo\n\n#### Product\n\n  * Overview\n  * TigerGraph 3.0\n  * TIGERGRAPH DB\n  * TIGERGRAPH CLOUD\n  * GRAPHSTUDIO\n  * TRY NOW\n\n#### customers\n\n  * success stories\n\n#### RESOURCES\n\n  * LIBRARY\n  * Events\n  * EDUCATION\n  * BLOG\n  * DEVELOPERS\n\n#### SOLUTIONS\n\n  * SOLUTIONS\n  * use cases\n  * industry\n\n#### Partners\n\n  * partner program\n\n#### company\n\n  * Overview\n  * news\n  * Press Release\n  * Awards\n\n#### start for free\n\n  * Request Demo\n  * take a test drive\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n  * Anti-Money Laundering Analytics with Graph DB\n  * Graph database solutions\n  * Expero toolkits\n\n  * SUPPORT\n  * COMMUNITY\n  * CONTACT\n\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2024 TigerGraph\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n  * Linkedin\n  * Twitter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 TigerGraph | Privacy Policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 TigerGraph Privacy Policy\n\n  * SUPPORT\n  * COMMUNITY\n\n  * COMPANY\n  * CONTACT\n\n  * Linkedin\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 TigerGraph\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
