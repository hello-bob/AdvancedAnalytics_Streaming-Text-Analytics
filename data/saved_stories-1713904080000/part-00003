And we\nknow what feels right in the given context. But have we challenged that\ncontext enough? Have we dug deep enough and asked how the medium we\u2019re\nengaging with has affected the very properties of the typeface\u2019s design? Its\nbase form. The \u2018standards\u2019 or expectations of that genre, style or language.\n\nAbove\n\nRajshree Saraf: Typespace (Copyright \u00a9 Rajshree Saraf, 2022)\n\n> \u201c[It\u2019s] an exciting frontier in type design, where technology and creativity\n> converge to redefine how we perceive and engage with typography.\u201d\n>\n> Rozi Zhu\n\nIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s been interrogated enough; however, it was first\nproposed in 1996\u2019s The World\u2019s Writing Systems \u2013 edited by Peter T. Daniels\nand William Bright \u2013 that the distinctive cursive and rotund forms of multiple\nSoutheast Asian and South Indian scripts are a result of material letterforms\nwere first inscribed on. For the case of Balinese, Devanagari, Telugu, Tamil\nor Odia, to name but a few, different forms of leaves were used as the\nplatform in which to write \u2013 for example, scratching messages into dried palm\nleaves before applying and whipping back an ink-like substance to reveal the\n\u2018printed\u2019 letters. It\u2019s argued that these Southeast Asian and South Indian\nscripts opted for rounder forms as more angular lines damaged the leaf\nsurface, making both the medium and the message beyond repair.\n\nMeanwhile, Western Latin scripts opted for angular, more linear forms as\nstandard, with the typical applications of lettering being carved into stone.\nIn fact, as Timothy Samara\u2019s Typography Workbook suggests, the structured\nstrokes and serifs of Roman lettering came from the stone carvers, who\nintroduced these small feet at the terminals of type forms to tidy up their\nappearance. Now, this lineage can be seen on screen, a long, long way from\ntheir engraved legacy, despite the drastic shift in medium.\n\nAbove\n\nDetail of a preserved palm leaf (borassus flabellifer) manuscripts showing\nwritings about ayurvedic medicines in old Malayalam script from Kerala, India\n\nThe surface of typographic usage has not greatly changed over the past few\ndecades since digital screens; however, we\u2019ve found ourselves at a fascinating\ncrossroads of technical and cultural interplay, whereby new spaces emerge for\ntype to exist. With Apple\u2019s VisionPro hitting the shelves, alongside other\nwell-established VR brands that continue to push the tech at different price\nbrackets \u2013 and AR's long-promised integration into daily life becoming\nincreasingly a reality \u2013 now art, type, and design face new avenues to\nconsider. And with it, new restrictions for practitioners to interrogate \u2013 the\nbasis for original, inventive and expressive creativity.\n\n\u201cWorking with new media is about navigating the technical restrictions and\nmaking a lot of design decisions around it,\u201d explains designer, researcher,\ncreative technologist and artist Rajshree Saraf, suggesting that the\nrestrictions on type for new tech \u2013 such as AR and VR \u2013 can be both\ncomputation and skill-based. \u201cMost days I spend wondering if the tech is the\nproblem or if I am the problem,\u201d she details; however, she utilises this to\nher advantage as an excuse to push herself creatively. \u201cThe output is rarely\nwhat I initially envisioned, but the restrictions are what makes the process\nof working with tech so rewarding for me.\u201d Rajshree is excited about the\n\u201cliteral physical restrictions\u201d that AR affords her as a designer. \u201cThe\nceiling might be too low, or the carpet is the wrong shape, or perhaps it\u2019s\njust too dark out,\u201d she contextualises, \u201cit\u2019s a lot of balancing those\nphysical restrictions with the technical restrictions in real-time \u2013 it\u2019s a\nnightmare, but honestly, it\u2019s just so fun... restrictions are fun.\u201d\n\n1 of 4\n\nRajshree Saraf: Typespace (Copyright \u00a9 Rajshree Saraf, 2022)\n\n1 of 4\n\nRajshree Saraf: Typespace (Copyright \u00a9 Rajshree Saraf, 2022)\n\n/\n\nAbove\n\nRight: Malmesbury Bible (link) Author: Gerard Brils, Vulgate manuscript: Book\nof Numbers 1:24-26.

Niteesh believes, as with any\nother design domain, the restrictions offer a direction to projects. \u201cStarting\nwith a blank canvas can feel overwhelming at times and I feel restriction in\nthat scenario helps in putting guardrails around the design process,\u201d he says,\n\u201cthe medium for me always plays a vital role in laying out its specific needs\nand that is where the creative journey starts.\u201d In doing so, raising the\nchallenge of how one can exploit the technical limitations of the medium to\nget the outcome that\u2019s needed, as well as ultimately asking how the medium\nphysically and technically affects the design of type forms.\n\nNiteesh believes AR technology is still in the evolutionary phase.\u201cThe\nresolution is lower than today\u2019s standards, and that, coupled with the\nbehaviour of light which tends to soften the edges, creates a lot of\nlegibility challenges in the medium,\u201d posing quite a challenge to type\ndesigners. \u201cTo overcome this behaviour and medium-specific limitation, I\ndesigned features like flaring at the ends,\u201d he explains, accommodating the\nmissing pixels in lower resolution and, in doing so, shaping a better\nletterform, leading to the creation of an entirely new design consideration.\n\u201cI introduced the \u2018Augmented Reality Retinal Resolution\u2019 axis that allows the\nuse of the same typeface for different headsets,\u201d he details, allowing one to\nadjust the typeface depending on its resolution.\n\n1 of 6\n\nNiteesh Yadav: Dehradun (Copyright \u00a9 Niteesh Yadav, 2023)\n\n1 of 6\n\nNiteesh Yadav: Dehradun (Copyright \u00a9 Niteesh Yadav, 2023)\n\n/\n\nAbove\n\nRozi Zhu: Bubble Type (Copyright \u00a9 Rozi Zhu, 2021)\n\n> \u201cWhat works for me is thinking of lettering in AR as designing mini-\n> experiences, not just simple extrusions of 2D type restricted to four\n> corners.\u201d\n>\n> Rajshree Saraf\n\n\u201cPhysically, the medium and existing technologies dictate the form, size, and\ndesign of the typeface,\u201d explains NYC-based multidisciplinary designer Rozi\nZhu. \u201cTechnically, different materials require specific techniques and\ntechnologies,\u201d and \u2013 as for our intrepid trio \u2013 this often necessitates the\ncreation of new approaches, processes and software. \u201cTalking about designing\ntypefaces for scripts like Devanagari for AR interfaces,\u201d Niteesh notes, \u201cthe\ninfluence of the medium becomes very clear where a lot of design decisions are\nbased on the rendering of text,\u201d due to the overlaps and junctions innate to\nDevanagari. \u201cIt requires careful consideration of where to add weight and\nwhere to reduce it,\u201d perhaps to a greater extent than Latin, again\nhighlighting the disparity in design considerations between Latin and\nSoutheast Asian scripts, even within the same digital space.\n\nRajshree\u2019s Typespace font deals with such issues, having been crafted\nexplicitly for AR with the aim of leveraging the unique \u201cspatial affordance\u201d\nthat the specific digital realm offers. \u201cI wanted to be able to customise AR\ntype to the environment in real-time,\u201d she recalls, \u201cmaking it fit weird\ncorners, stairs, water fountains and more,\u201d a feat that comes with its fair\nshare of techy challenges. \u201cI wanted it to look a little more stylistic but\nevery added vertex made processing much more burdening,\u201d she explains, making\nthe whole thing crash. Turning to early digital fonts for inspiration,\nRajshree opted for a more low-fi approach, taking technology a step back to\npush forward, using \u201cprimitive 3D cubes\u201d to construct the lettering, making it\ncomputationally efficient. \u201cHistorically, every media has had an impact on how\nthe type looks, and if this low-fi pixel aesthetic was AR\u2019s, so be it,\u201d she\ntells us, \u201cthe tech is evolving so fast, it\u2019s only a matter of time before it\nchanges.\u201d Adding, Rajshree explans, \u201cI realised how AR\u2019s capability elevated\nthe dated pixel look,\u201d noting, \u201cAR gave the humble cubes the flexibility to be\nscalable and variable in all dimensions\u201d; utilising the spatial capability of\nits context, fighting its technical challenges, and shaping its own style in\nthe process.

After\nall, these are the typographic forms we (in theory) could be facing, using and\ndealing with on a daily basis \u2013 especially if Apple\u2019s spatial visions become a\nreality. \u201cThere are no blank canvases in AR,\u201d Rajshree continues, \u201cphysical\ncontexts become important in AR for conceptual and emotional considerations,\u201d\na fact long ignored with AR\u2019s general aesthetic being trendy, shiny and 3D.\n\u201cIt is hard to convey complex emotions beyond the form of the letters,\u201d she\nadds, but considering the AR environment as something experiential goes quite\na distance. \u201cWhat works for me is thinking of lettering in AR as designing\nmini-experiences, not just simple extrusions of 2D type restricted to four\ncorners,\u201d Rajshree details. \u201cIt means thinking beyond the form and the\ntexture; we should also think about the spatial composition,\u201d considering\ninteractivity and integration within the physical world. \u201cTech applications\nfeel more devoid of emotions,\u201d Niteesh adds, paying attention to user\nexpectations across his design process. \u201cIn tech, quirkiness is not that\nwidespread, so most of the time I focus on the functional aspects,\u201d he\ncontinues, focusing again on experience, \u201chowever, on lettering projects, I\ntend to go more experimental and emotion-heavy approach.\u201d\n\nHere, both the medium of the message and the material of the message play\nsignificant roles in expressing character, something that, up until this\npoint, was limited mostly by ink colours, foils and the like. \u201cDifferent\nmediums lead to varying tools and techniques for creation, each with its own\nset of possibilities and limitations,\u201d Rozi explains, \u201cand each medium evokes\nunique visual effects and emotional resonance,\u201d referencing her own lettering\nas examples. \u201cBubbles suggest transience, crystals convey strength, and\nferrofluids offer playful fluidity,\u201d she says \u201cThis intertwines the choice of\nmedium with conceptual and emotional aspects of typeface design,\u201d shaping the\noverall aesthetic and distilling qualities reflective of the chosen medium\u2019s\npersonality. She adds, \u201ceach medium brings its own unique properties,\ninfluencing both the conceptual and emotional,\u201d something that will become all\nthe more critical when we look towards the future development of type design,\nmoving to emerging and developing spaces.\n\nAbove\n\nRozi Zhu: Crystal Type (Copyright \u00a9 Rozi Zhu, 2022)\n\nAbove\n\nRight: Rajshree Saraf: Typespace (Copyright \u00a9 Rajshree Saraf, 2022)\n\nAbove\n\nRozi Zhu: Bubble Type (Copyright \u00a9 Rozi Zhu, 2021)\n\nAs the reading experience moves beyond flat surfaces to hyper-immersive\nenvironments, it will ultimately affect how type is engaged and interacted\nwith \u2013 going from a more passive relationship to an active one. Alongside the\ndevelopment of new tools for type design, Rozi suggests that there is great\npotential for accessible typefaces, giving a braille font as an example.\n\u201cBraille necessitates tactile engagement,\u201d she explains, \u201cleveraging\nadvancements in spatial computing, it\u2019s conceivable to integrate tactile\nelements into digital interfaces,\u201d Rozi concludes. \u201cWhile these changes won\u2019t\noccur overnight, they represent an exciting frontier in type design, where\ntechnology and creativity converge to redefine how we perceive and engage with\ntypography.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re headed in an era of experimental typography,\u201d Rajshree adds,\n\u201cnew media means there are no old rules to feel bound by,\u201d noting that there\nis no \u2018right way\u2019 to do things, especially right now. \u201cAR has a whole new\ndimension and physicality attached to it that\u2019s not limited to our screens,\u201d\nshe continues, with the simple extrusion of 2D fonts into 3D media not being\nenough. \u201cThere might be a lot more explorations in 3D-first typefaces,\u201d\nRajshree suggests, raising, challenging and asking questions of the user\nexperience, such as \u2018How should the type change based on the reader\u2019s viewing\nangle?\u2019 Or \u2018how can we make typography responsive so that it adapts to the\nsurroundings?\u2019 All considered within the realm of restrictions. \u201cI think the\nevolution of spatial computing and AR/VR technologies means an era of crazy\nexperimental typography,\u201d Rajshree concludes, \u201cand I am here for it.\u201d\n\nAbove\n\nAbove\n\nRozi Zhu: Ferrofluid Logo Motion for Qie Media (Copyright \u00a9 Rozi Zhu, 2021)\n\n\u201cThe bigger change will be expectations of highly adaptable typefaces,\u201d\nNiteesh remarks, as, within these digital spaces, the users, rather than the\ndesigners, have control of the typefaces. \u201cThere are countless variables like\never-changing backgrounds, brightness of the environments,\u201d he adds, \u201creading\nthe text outdoors on a typical day in London that in Delhi is quite different,\nfor example. To design for such scenarios, typefaces that can adapt to\ndifferent aspects, using the wide array of sensor data from the AR devices,\nare going to be the way ahead,\u201d \u2013 meaning many more variable axes, including\nones yet to be invented. Whichever way the medium heads, it looks like the\nform of the message will be dedicated to one thing more than ever before \u2013 the\nexperience. With it inevitably being more personalised than ever, perhaps we\nshould be asking, how can the message\u2019s medium reinforce the message itself?\nAnd how can this help culture moving forward?\n\n### Hero Header\n\nRozi Zhu: Crystal Type (Copyright \u00a9 Rozi Zhu, 2022)\n\n### Share Article\n\n### Further Info\n\nniteeshyadav.com rozi.design rajshreesaraf.com\n\n### About the Author\n\nHarry Bennett\n\n\u2014\n\nHailing from the West Midlands, and having originally joined It\u2019s Nice That as\nan editorial assistant in March 2020, Harry is a freelance writer and designer\n\u2013 running his own independent practice, as well as being one-half of the\nStudio Ground Floor.\n\nView more from\n\nTypography\n\n### Type knitter R\u00fcdiger Schl\u00f6mer makes fonts for screens and jumpers\n\n5 hours ago\n\n  * Work\n\n  * Graphic Design\n\n  * ...\n\n### Elizabeth Goodspeed on how signs remind us of design beyond the screen\n\n6 days ago\n\n  * Work\n\n  * Graphic Design\n\n  * ...\n\n### This minimalist yet playful festival identity honours the artisanal crafts\nof the Canary Islands\n\n7 days ago\n\n  * Work\n\n  * Graphic Design\n\n  * ...\n\n### Identity for Talbott & Arding emphasises the gourmet in graphic design\n\n12 days ago\n\n  * Work\n\n  * Graphic Design\n\n  * ...\n\nView more from\n\nTechnology\n\n### Tired of messy workflows and moving deadlines?
