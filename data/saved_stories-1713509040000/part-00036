Jones\n\n4 hours ago\n\n5 min read\n\n1\n\nThe Deep Space Station 43 radio antenna, located at the Canberra Deep Space\nCommunication Complex in Australia, keeps open the line of communication\nbetween humans and probes during NASA missions.\n\nCarole Lloyd/Alamy\n\nieee history nasa space antenna ieee milestone ieee history center type:ti\n\nFor more than 50 years, Deep Space Station 43 has been an invaluable tool for\nspace probes as they explore our solar system and push into the beyond. The\nDSS-43 radio antenna, located at the Canberra Deep Space Communication\nComplex, near Canberra, Australia, keeps open the line of communication\nbetween humans and probes during NASA missions.\n\nToday more than 40 percent of all data retrieved by celestial explorers,\nincluding Voyagers, New Horizons, and the Mars Curiosity rover, comes through\nDSS-43.\n\n\u201cAs Australia\u2019s largest antenna, DSS-43 has provided two-way communication\nwith dozens of robotic spacecraft,\u201d IEEE President-Elect Kathleen Kramer said\nduring a ceremony where the antenna was recognized as an IEEE Milestone. It\nhas supported missions, Kramer noted, \u201cfrom the Apollo program and NASA\u2019s Mars\nexploration rovers such as Spirit and Opportunity to the Voyagers\u2019 grand tour\nof the solar system.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d she said, \u201cit is the only antenna remaining on Earth capable of\ncommunicating with Voyager 2.\u201d\n\n## Why NASA needed DSS-43\n\nMaintaining two-way contact with spacecraft hurtling billions of kilometers\naway across the solar system is no mean feat. Researchers at NASA\u2019s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif., knew that communication with\ndistant space probes would require a dish antenna with unprecedented accuracy.\nIn 1964 they built DSS-42\u2014DSS-43\u2019s predecessor\u2014to support NASA\u2019s Mariner 4\nspacecraftas it performed the first-ever successful flyby of Mars in July\n1965. The antenna had a 26-meter-diameter dish. Along with two other antennas\nat JPL and in Spain, DSS-42 obtained the first close-up images of Mars. DSS-42\nwas retired in 2000.\n\nNASA engineers predicted that to carry out missions beyond Mars, the space\nagency needed more sensitive antennas. So in 1969 they began work on DSS-43,\nwhich has a 64-meter-diameter dish.\n\nDSS-43 was brought online in December 1972\u2014just in time to receive video and\naudio transmissions sent by Apollo 17 from the surface of the moon. It had\ngreater reach and sensitivity than DSS-42 even after 42\u2019s dish was upgraded in\nthe early 1980s.\n\nThe gap between the two antennas\u2019 capabilities widened in 1987, when DSS-43\nwas equipped with a 70-meter dish in anticipation of Voyager 2\u2019s 1989\nencounter with the planet Neptune.\n\nDSS-43 has been indispensable in maintaining contact with the deep-space probe\never since.\n\nThe dish\u2019s size isn\u2019t its only remarkable feature. The dish\u2019s manufacturer\ntook great pains to ensure that its surface had no bumps or rough spots. The\nsmoother the dish surface, the better it is at focusing incident waves onto\nthe signal detector so there\u2019s a higher signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nDSS-43 boasts a pointing accuracy of 0.005 degrees (18 arc seconds)\u2014which is\nimportant for ensuring that it is pointed directly at the receiver on a\ndistant spacecraft. Voyager 2 broadcasts using a 23-watt radio. But by the\ntime the signals traverse the multibillion-kilometer distance from the\nheliopause to Earth, their power has faded to a level 20 billion times weaker\nthan what is needed to run a digital watch. Capturing every bit of the\nincident signals is crucial to gathering useful information from the\ntransmissions.\n\nThe antenna has a transmitter capable of 400 kilowatts, with a beam width of\n0.0038 degrees. Without the 1987 upgrade, signals sent from DSS-43 to a\nspacecraft venturing outside the solar system likely never would reach their\ntarget.\n\n## NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network\n\nThe Canberra Deep Space Complex, where DSS-43 resides, is one of three such\ntracking stations operated by JPL. The other two are DSS-11 at the Goldstone\nDeep Space Communications Complex near Barstow, Calif., and DSS-63 at the\nMadrid Deep Space Communications Complex in Robledo de Chavela, Spain.\nTogether, the facilities make up the Deep Space Network, which is the most\nsensitive scientific telecommunications system on the planet, according to\nNASA. At any given time, the network is tracking dozens of spacecraft carrying\nout scientific missions. The three facilities are spaced about 120 degrees\nlongitude apart. The strategic placement ensures that as the Earth rotates, at\nleast one of the antennas has a line of sight to an object being tracked, at\nleast for those close to the plane of the solar system.\n\nBut DSS-43 is the only member of the trio that can maintain contact with\nVoyager 2. Ever since its flyby of Neptune\u2019s moon Triton in 1989, Voyager 2\nhas been on a trajectory below the plane of the planets, so that it no longer\nhas a line of sight with any radio antennas in the Earth\u2019s Northern\nHemisphere.\n\nTo ensure that DSS-43 can still place the longest of long-distance calls, the\nantenna underwent a round of updates in 2020. A new X-band cone was installed.\nDSS-43 transmits radio signals in the X (8 to 12 gigahertz) and S (2 to 4 GHz)\nbands; it can receive signals in the X, S, L (1 to 2 GHz), and K (12 to 40\nGHz) bands. The dish\u2019s pointing accuracy also was tested and recertified.\n\nOnce the updates were completed, test commands were sent to Voyager 2. After\nabout 37 hours, DSS-43 received a response from the space probe confirming it\nhad received the call, and it executed the test commands with no issues.\n\nDSS-43 is still relaying signals between Earth and Voyager 2, which passed the\nheliopause in 2018 and is now some 20 billion km from Earth.\n\n[From left] IEEE Region 10 director Lance Fung, Kevin Furguson, IEEE\nPresident-Elect Kathleen Kramer, and Ambarish Natu, past chair of the IEEE\nAustralian Capital Territory Section at the IEEE Milestone dedication ceremony\nheld at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex in Australia. Furguson\nis the director of the complex.Ambarish Natu\n\n## Other important missions\n\nDSS-43 has played a vital role in missions closer to Earth as well, including\nNASA\u2019s Mars Science Laboratory mission. When the space agency sent Curiosity,\na golf cart\u2013size rover, to explore the Gale crater and Mount Sharp on Mars in\n2011, DSS-43 tracked Curiosity as it made its nail-biting seven-minute descent\ninto Mars\u2019s atmosphere. It took roughly 20 minutes for radio signals to\ntraverse the 320-million km distance between Mars and Earth, and then DSS-43\ndelivered the good news: The rover had landed safely and was operational.\n\n\u201cNASA plans to send future generations of astronauts from the Moon to Mars,\nand DSS-43 will play an important role as part of NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network,\u201d\nsays Ambarish Natu, an IEEE senior member who is a past chair of the IEEE\nAustralian Capital Territory (ACT) Section.\n\nDSS-43 was honored with an IEEE Milestone in March during a ceremony held at\nthe Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex.\n\n\u201cThis is the second IEEE Milestone recognition given in Australia, and the\nfirst for ACT,\u201d Lance Fung, IEEE Region 10 director, said during the ceremony.\nA plaque recognizing the technology is now displayed at the complex. It reads:\n\nFirst operational in 1972 and later upgraded in 1987, Deep Space Station 43\n(DSS-43) is a steerable parabolic antenna that supported the Apollo 17 lunar\nmission, Viking Mars landers, Pioneer and Mariner planetary probes, and\nVoyager\u2019s encounters with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Planning for\nmany robotic and human missions to explore the solar system and beyond has\nincluded DSS-43 for critical communications and tracking in NASA\u2019s Deep Space\nNetwork.\n\nAdministered by the IEEE History Center and supported by donors, the Milestone\nprogram recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world.
