This gave rise to CADuntu.\n\nThe project was known as CADuntu only for a couple of months before the\ncommunity decided that the name was inappropriate. After some discussion\nwithin the community and research on existing names, CADuntu was renamed to\nLibreCAD.\n\nPorting the rendering engine to Qt4 proved to be a large task, so LibreCAD\ninitially still depended on the Qt3 support library. The Qt4 porting was\ncompleted eventually during the development of 2.0.0 series, thanks to our\nmaster developer Rallaz, and LibreCAD has become Qt3 free except in the 1.0.0\nseries.\n\nMeanwhile, for LibreCAD 2.2.0 series, Qt5 is mandatory.\n\n# LibreCAD Features\n\nLibreCAD is a feature-packed and mature 2D-CAD application with some really\ngreat advantages:\n\n## Completely and Utterly Free\n\nNo worries about trials, subscriptions, license costs or annual fees.\n\n## Open Source and GPLv2\n\nDeveloped by an experienced team and supported by an awesome community,\nLibreCAD is also free to hack and copy.\n\n## No Language Barriers\n\nIt's available in over 30 languages with cross-platform support for macOS,\nWindows, and Linux.\n\n# LibreCAD Download\n\n## macOS\n\nHelp is needed for macOS deployment.\n\nfrom SourceForge Find latest stable DMG packages there.\n\nfrom GitHub Find latest stable DMG packages there.\n\n## Windows\n\nfrom SourceForge Find latest stable EXE installer there.\n\nfrom GitHub Find latest stable EXE installer there. Also special prerelease\ninstaller for beta testing versions.\n\n## Linux\n\nCheck your distributions preferred package manager, if LibreCAD is available\nthere. But the version may be a bit older.\n\nfrom GitHub Find latest binary AppImage packages there.\n\n## Build from source\n\nThis is an option for all platforms.\n\nIf we don't have the binary installer you are looking for, you can try to\nbuild LibreCAD from source code. How this works for each platform can be read\nin our manual .\n\nSource code could be downloaded from GitHub as ZIP archive.\n\nOr you can clone or fork our repository, which is recommended if you plan to\ncontribute.\n\n# Join LibreCAD Community\n\nThe LibreCAD team is a small group of dedicated people. Lots of things have\nbeen worked out, but plenty of bugs and features are still waiting to be\nsolved. How can you help? We need all the skills in the community as coders,\nwriters, testers or translators.\n\nAn open source community is a dynamic thing; people come and go as their\nprivate situation drives or stops them contributing. So, it will always help\nif you have existing resources we can use, know what other projects do in\nspecific areas, or, most importantly, do what you do best and have fun doing\nit!\n\nYou don't have to sign a lifetime contract to contribute. Whether you can help\nothers in the forum, garden the wiki, or apply one or many patches, our broad\nuser base will appreciate your work.\n\nCome join our community, and contribute in any way you like.\n\n## Develop\n\nIf you are an outstanding developer in C++ or a beginner we can use your help.\nWith a bit of determination, the IRC channel, Zulip chat and the Libre-CAD-dev\nmailing list, we can help you get started and make progress. All you need is\nlinked in download section and top links above.\n\n## Document\n\nDevelopers usually make bad documentation for users, so if you like making\ndocumentation, great! There are continuous GUI changes in LibreCAD that need\nto be documented.\n\n## Translate\n\nHelp localize LibreCAD, we currently support over 30 languages. Our\ntranslation server is over here: translate.librecad.org/ . You can complete\nnew languages, or request creating translations for a new language in the\nforum .\n\n# LibreCAD Friends & Sponsors\n\nAs a non-profit, community driven open source project LibreCAD is dependent on\nhaving good relationships with friends and sponsors.\n\n## Friends\n\n### BRL-CAD\n\nBRL-CAD is a powerful open source cross-platform solid modelling system that\nincludes interactive geometry editing, high-performance ray-tracing for\nrendering and geometric analysis, a system performance analysis benchmark\nsuite, geometry libraries for application developers, and more than 30 years\nof active development.\n\nBRL-CAD and LibreCAD collaborate in Google programs. We participate under the\numbrella of BRL-CAD in Google Code-in and Google Summer of Code where we\nmentor school pupils and students in participating in open source projects.\n\n## Sponsors\n\n### Weblate\n\nWeblate is an open-source, web-based, contiuous localization platform. They\ngenerously provide us with a free hosted instance for LibreCAD localization.\n\n### Zulip\n\nZulip is an open-source modern team chat app designed to keep both live and\nasynchronous conversations organized. They generously provide us with a free\nhosted instance for LibreCAD community conversation.\n\nA big thank you also goes to all the supporters on Open Collective and GitHub\nSponsors . With their donations they make an important contribution to\nmaintaining our community.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all text and images on this website are licensed\nunder the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (CC BY 4.0).
