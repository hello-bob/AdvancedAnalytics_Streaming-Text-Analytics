One of the devices I mentioned\nwas the Humane AI Pin, which has just been the recipient of one of the biggest\nroast reviews I\u2019ve ever seen [2], good work Marques Brownlee! As an aside I\nwas once given a product to review which didn\u2019t work nearly as well as I think\nit should have worked so I sent an email to the developers saying \u201csorry this\nproduct failed to work well so I can\u2019t say anything good about it\u201d and didn\u2019t\npublish a review.One of the first things that caught my attention in the\nreview is the note that the AI Pin doesn\u2019t connect to your phone. I think that\neverything should connect to everything else as a usability feature. For\nsecurity we don\u2019t want so much connecting and it\u2019s quite reasonable to turn\noff various connections at appropriate times for security, the Librem5 is an\nexample of how this can be done with hardware switches to disable Wifi etc.\nBut to just not have connectivity is bad.The next noteworthy thing is the\nexternal battery which also acts as a magnetic attachment from inside your\nshirt. So I guess it\u2019s using wireless charging through your shirt. A\nmagnetically attached external battery would be a great feature for a phone,\nyou could quickly swap a discharged battery for a fresh one and keep using it.\nWhen I tried to make the PinePhonePro my daily driver [3] I gave up and\ncharging was one of the main reasons. One thing I learned from my experiment\nwith the PinePhonePro is that the ratio of charge time to discharge time is\nsometimes more important than battery life and being able to quickly swap\nbatteries without rebooting is a way of solving that. The reviewer of the AI\nPin complains later in the video about battery life which seems to be partly\ndue to wireless charging from the detachable battery and partly due to being\nphysically small. It seems the \u201cphablet\u201d form factor is the smallest viable\npersonal computer at this time.The review glosses over what could be the\nregarded as the 2 worst issues of the device. It does everything via the cloud\n(where \u201cthe cloud\u201d means \u201ca computer owned by someone I probably shouldn\u2019t\ntrust\u201d) and it records everything. Strange that it\u2019s not getting the hate the\nGoogle Glass got.The user interface based on laser projection of menus on the\npalm of your hand is an interesting concept. I\u2019d rather have a Bluetooth\nattached tablet or something for operations that can\u2019t be conveniently done\nwith voice. The reviewer harshly criticises the laser projection interface\nlater in the video, maybe technology isn\u2019t yet adequate to implement this\nproperly.The first criticism of the device in the \u201creview\u201d part of the video\nis of the time taken to answer questions, especially when Internet\nconnectivity is poor. His question \u201cwho designed the Washington Monument\u201d took\n8 seconds to start answering it in his demonstration. I asked the Alpaca LLM\nthe same question running on 4 cores of a E5-2696 and it took 10 seconds to\nstart answering and then printed the words at about speaking speed. So if we\nhad a free software based AI device for this purpose it shouldn\u2019t be difficult\nto get local LLM computation with less delay than the Humane device by simply\nproviding more compute power than 4 cores of a E5-2696v3. How does a 32 core\n1.05GHz Mali G72 from 2017 (as used in the Galaxy Note 9) compare to 4 cores\nof a 2.3GHz Intel CPU from 2015? Passmark says that Intel CPU can do 48GFlop\nwith all 18 cores so 4 cores can presumably do about 10GFlop which seems less\nthan the claimed 20-32GFlop of the Mali G72. It seems that with the right\nsoftware even older Android phones could give adequate performance for a local\nLLM. The Alpaca model I\u2019m testing with takes 4.2G of RAM to run which is\nusable in a Note 9 with 8G of RAM or a Pixel 8 Pro with 12G. A Pixel 8 Pro\ncould have 4.2G of RAM reserved for a LLM and still have as much RAM for other\npurposes as my main laptop as of a few months ago. I consider the speed of\nAlpaca on my workstation to be acceptable but not great. If we can get FOSS\nphones running a LLM at that speed then I think it would be great for a first\nversion \u2013 we can always rely on newer and faster hardware becoming\navailable.Marques notes that the cause of some of the problems is likely due\nto a desire to make it a separate powerful product in the future and that if\nthey gave it phone connectivity in the start they would have to remove that\nlater on. I think that the real problem is that the profit motive is\nincompatible with good design. They want to have a product that\u2019s stand-alone\nand justifies the purchase price plus subscription and that means not making\nit a \u201cphone accessory\u201d. While I think that the best thing for the user is to\nallow it to talk to a phone, a PC, a car, and anything else the user wants. He\ncompares it to the Apple Vision Pro which has the same issue of trying to be a\nstand-alone computer but not being properly capable of it.One of the benefits\nthat Marques cites for the AI Pin is the ability to capture voice notes.\nDictaphones have been around for over 100 years and very few people have\nbought them, not even in the 80s when they became cheap. While almost everyone\ncan occasionally benefit from being able to make a note of an idea when it\u2019s\nnot convenient to write it down there are few people who need it enough to\ncarry a separate device, not even if that device is tiny. But a phone as a\ngeneral purpose computing device with microphone can easily be adapted to such\nthings. One possibility would be to program a phone to start a voice note when\nthe volume up and down buttons are pressed at the same time or when some other\ncondition is met. Another possibility is to have a phone have a hotkey\nfunction that varies by what you are doing, EG if bushwalking have the hotkey\nbe to take a photo or if on a flight have it be taking a voice note. On the\nMobile Apps page on the Debian wiki I created a section for categories of apps\nthat I think we need [4]. In that section I added the following list:\n\n  1. Voice input for dictation\n  2. Voice assistant like Google/Apple\n  3. Voice output\n  4. Full operation for visually impaired people\n\nOne thing I really like about the AI Pin is that it has the potential to\nbecome a really good computing and personal assistant device for visually\nimpaired people funded by people with full vision who want to legally control\na computer while driving etc. I have some concerns about the potential uses of\nthe AI Pin while driving (as Marques stated an aim to do), but if it replaces\nthe use of regular phones while driving it will make things less bad.Marques\nconcludes his video by warning against buying a product based on the promise\nof what it can be in future. I bought the Librem5 on exactly that promise, the\ndifference is that I have the source and the ability to help make the promise\ncome true. My aim is to spend thousands of dollars on test hardware and\nthousands of hours of development time to help make FOSS phones a product that\nmost people can use at low price with little effort.Another interesting review\nof the pin is by Mrwhostheboss [5], one of his examples is of asking the pin\nfor advice about a chair but without him knowing the pin selected a different\nchair in the room. He compares this to using Google\u2019s apps on a phone and\nseeing which item the app has selected. He also said that he doesn\u2019t want to\nmake an order based on speech he wants to review a page of information about\nit. I suspect that the design of the pin had too much input from people\naccustomed to asking a corporate travel office to find them a flight and not\nenough from people who look through the details of the results of flight\nbooking services trying to save an extra $20. Some people might say \u201cif you\nneed to save $20 on a flight then a $24/month subscription computing service\nisn\u2019t for you\u201d, I reject that argument. I can afford lots of computing\nservices because I try to get the best deal on every moderately expensive\nthing I pay for. Another point that Mrwhostheboss makes is regarding secret\nSMS, you probably wouldn\u2019t want to speak a SMS you are sending to your SO\nwhile waiting for a train. He makes it clear that changing between phone and\npin while sharing resources (IE not having a separate phone number and\nseparate data store) is a desired feature.The most insightful point\nMrwhostheboss made was when he suggested that if the pin had come out before\nthe smartphone then things might have all gone differently, but now anything\nthat\u2019s developed has to be based around the expectations of phone use. This is\nsomething we need to keep in mind when developing FOSS software, there\u2019s lots\nof different ways that things could be done but we need to meet the\nexpectations of users if we want our software to be used by many people.I\npreviously wrote a blog post titled Considering Convergence [6] about the\npossible ways of using a phone as a laptop. While I still believe what I wrote\nthere I\u2019m now considering the possibility of ease of movement of work in\nprogress as a way of addressing some of the same issues. I\u2019ve written a blog\npost about Convergence vs Transferrence [7].\n\n  * [1] https://etbe.coker.com.au/2024/03/13/shape-computers/\n  * [2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA\n  * [3] https://etbe.coker.com.au/2023/10/11/pinephone-status/\n  * [4] https://wiki.debian.org/MobileApps\n  * [5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O2yTG3n1Vc\n  * [6] https://etbe.coker.com.au/2023/05/29/considering-convergence/\n  * [7] https://etbe.coker.com.au/2024/04/26/convergence-vs-transference/\n\nRelated posts:\n\n  1.
