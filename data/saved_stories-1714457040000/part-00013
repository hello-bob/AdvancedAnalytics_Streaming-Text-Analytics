As of\nApril 12, more than 33,000 people have been killed in Gaza according to UN\nOCHA reports. In response to the IDF offensive the International Court of\nJustice issued interim measures to prevent genocide.\n\nSystematic and widespread attacks on civilian housing and infrastructure in\nGaza has been described as \u201cdomicide\u201d by Professor Balakrishnan Rajagopal, the\nUN\u2019s Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing. He told us \u201cEven\nwith attacks against individual buildings, every building which is bombed or\ndestroyed has got to be evaluated legally. Whether a building on this or that\ncorner of a road needed to be destroyed or not...the burden is on the IDF to\nshow that they have evidence, that they have proof and that the attack is\nproportionate and necessary\u201d. It\u2019s estimated that more than 50% of Gaza\u2019s\nbuildings have been destroyed or damaged and approximately 1.7 million people\nhave been displaced since the offensive began. Bellingcat worked with partners\nScripps News to investigate the alleged domicide in Gaza and the ongoing\nconflicts over land in the West Bank, you can watch the full documentary here.\n\nThe constant repetition of images of destruction inside Gaza, where entire\nneighbourhoods have been turned into rubble, can result in desensitisation\nabout the impact of the offensive.\n\nYet behind each ruined building, each demolished minaret, each pile of rubble,\nthere is a decision and an action which has been carried out by a specific\nunit or person.\n\nWe used social media to track a single IDF combat engineering battalion, 8219\nCommando, as they moved across Gaza, demolishing tunnels, houses, and mosques.\n\n8219 Commando is a combat engineering battalion associated with 551 Commando\nBrigade and - as one of its members asks journalists to report - part of the\n98th Division. We noticed that soldiers from 8219 openly posted about their\nexperiences inside Gaza, providing a window into military operations that\nrarely opens when looking at official sources.\n\nOne member of 8219, a captain, wrote posts about his experience in the form of\na war diary, noting where they were, and what they destroyed. These posts,\ncombined with social media posts by other members of 8219, include videos,\npictures and statements describing the unit\u2019s experience of war. We geolocated\neach video or image of a demolition, verifying exactly where it took place. We\nthen used satellite imagery from Planet Labs to determine when the demolition\nhad occurred.\n\nWe used all these sources to build up a picture of where 8219 went, what it\ndemolished and why.\n\n### November 13-14 - Building\n\n31.5008,34.4138\n\nThe first demolition we identified which 8219 participated in occurred on\nNovember 13 or 14. Members of the unit demolished a two story building\noverlooking the Mediterranean Sea. No justification for this demolition was\ngiven in the post.\n\n### November 20-23 - Residential Housing Blocks\n\n31.5056,34.4313\n\nAfter this, the pace and scale of demolitions appeared to pick up\nconsiderably. Between November 20 and 23, the battalion participated in\nmultiple demolitions of residential tower blocks immediately next to Al Quds\nHospital in the neighbourhood of Tel al-Hawa, Gaza City.\n\n31.5063,34.4319\n\n31.5050,34.4323\n\n31.5043,34.4332\n\n### November 14, 2023 - Before\n\n### November 26, 2023 - After\n\nSatellite imagery of this neighbourhood shows that at least 34 residential\nhousing blocks were either completely or partially destroyed during this time.\nAs most of these blocks were seven to ten storeys high, this meant the\ndemolition of a significant amount of homes.\n\n### On November 19, the Captain wrote about finding rockets and a UAV at one\nlocation, which matches a Times of Israel report from this time. He did not\nexplain why this discovery required the destruction of so many residential\nblocks.\n\n### December 7-10 - Building\n\n31.4849,34.4536\n\nBetween December 7 and 10, another building was demolished.\n\n### December 10-15 - Al-Islah Mosque\n\n31.4960,34.4681\n\nSometime between December 10 and 15, Al-Islah mosque and an adjacent building\nwere demolished. Religious buildings receive protected status under\nInternational Humanitarian Law. An Instagram post depicting this mosque being\nprepared for demolition claimed that \u201cEvery house, mosque and school has been\nused here for terror purposes: either as a place for terrorists, an explosives\nwarehouse or a military base\u201d.\n\nSeveral months later, on February 19 2024, the mosque\u2019s Facebook page posted\nan image of the destroyed building, its minaret collapsed into the road.\n\n### December 17-19 - Buildings Around Al-Islah Mosque\n\n31.4955,34.4659\n\nA few days after the Al-Islah mosque was destroyed, several demolitions took\nplace in the neighbourhood around it.\n\n### December 26 - January 3 - Neighbourhood in Khuza\u2019a\n\nAfter the demolitions in the North of Gaza, the focus of the unit switched to\nKhuza\u2019a, a town to the south east of Khan Younis. The Captain notes that a\nseparate unit requested the help of 8219, indicating that their chain of\ncommand changed for this operation.\n\n31.3099,34.3656\n\nThis operation included a large number of demolitions in the town of Khuza\u2019a\nand Khirbat Ikhza\u2019a. Between December 26 and January 6, the IDF bulldozed\nlarge areas and demolished buildings using explosives.\n\n31.3098,34.3634\n\n31.3105,34.3625\n\n31.3085,34.3635\n\n31.3068,34.3622\n\n### December 2, 2023 - Before\n\n### January 16, 2024 - After\n\n\u201cWe've become addicted to explosions,\u201d The Captain said in a post on December\n28. Satellite imagery shows the extent of this destruction.\n\n### Khuza\u2019a and Khirbat Ikhza\u2019a are very close to the border with Israel.\nThese demolitions appear to be part of an effort to create a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d\nbetween Gaza and Israel. However, the Captain added further details in a\nFacebook post, describing this operation as one to take and \u201cdestroy the\nvillage of the murderers\u201d.\n\n### January 12-15 - Neighbourhood in Khan Younis\n\n31.3422,34.3054\n\nThe final demolition we identified took place in the heart of Khan Younis, a\ncity in the south of the Gaza Strip, in mid January. The Captain posted at\nlength about an operation on Facebook, including claiming that they had\nreceived more than 300 mines for use in the operation. Other soldiers posted\nimages and videos from this location.\n\n### January 7, 2024 - Before\n\n### January 19, 2024 - After\n\nPlanet Labs imagery shows a large area of destroyed buildings in Khan Younis,\nnear where we geolocated the photos and videos from 8219 soldiers.\n\nA tour video from 8219 Commando claims that in 84 days of fighting they\ndestroyed 49 tunnels and 662 buildings. Our partners at Scripps News\ninterviewed a member of 8219, Yonatan Segal, who said \u201cI think we are the\nunit, at least until we left, that blew up the most amount of houses in Gaza.\u201d\n\n### The Captain himself said they destroyed \u201cthousands\u201d of buildings, noting\nin a post on January 13, 2024 that his Commanding Officer told him there is\n\u201cno precedent\u201d for this in the IDF and that they had stopped counting the\nbuildings they had destroyed.\n\n### Sometimes soldiers did not give an explanation about why they carried out\ndemolitions. Other times they listed a number of objectives or reasons for the\ndemolitions. One of these appears to be seeking revenge. For instance, one\npost from the Captain notes his company commander described the destruction of\nswathes of Khuza\u2019a as revenge for October 7 and deaths of soldiers.\n\nWhen interviewed by our partners Scripps News, 8219 member Yonatan Segal said\nhe did not post about the demolitions on social media but had videos of them\non his phone. Asked if revenge was one of the motivations behind the\ndemolitions he said: \u201cYes. But what is revenge? Revenge in terms of teaching\nthem a lesson, so to speak, so that they would never do that again.\u201d\n\nReligious elements appear to creep in. In one post regarding the demolition in\nKhan Younis the Captain talks of using 400 mines to demolish a residential\narea \u201cin honour of the Shabbat\u201d.\n\nWe asked Professor Balakrishnan Rajagopal, the UN\u2019s Special Rapporteur on\nadequate housing and the Professor of Law and Development at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology about the demolitions carried out by 8219 Commando. He\ntold us that these demolitions were relevant to the ICJ case on genocide,\nsupporting South Africa\u2019s case that Israel was, in effect, rendering Gaza\nuninhabitable. He noted that even if it was not possible to establish\ngenocidal intent, widespread destruction rendering a place uninhabitable could\nstill amount to a crime against humanity.\n\nFurther, he noted that the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d being cleared by the IDF along the\nborder with Gaza doesn\u2019t fit the definition of such zones within the Geneva\nConventions and is effectively a \u201cland-grab\u201d taking approximately 16% of\nGaza\u2019s land.\n\nMairav Zonszein, a Senior Analyst on Israel-Palestine at the International\nCrisis Group which monitors conflict, said the current conflict wasn\u2019t the\nonly example of demolitions of Palestinian homes by the IDF but it was \u201con a\nscope that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\n\nShe said there were a few reasons the demolitions were happening, ranging from\nrevenge to an extremely punitive interpretation of \u2018deradicalisation\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey have a policy of deterrence which means that if somebody fires at us,\nwe\u2019ll come back at them ten times harder\u201d, Zonszein told Bellingcat.\n\n\u201cEssentially the aim of the offensive is to take apart Hamas as an entity, but\nthey don\u2019t distinguish. Part of that is destroying infrastructure and changing\nthe urban fabric through demolitions\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to take apart a society.\u201d\n\nIn addition to clearing the \u2018buffer zone\u2019, Zonszein said areas of northern\nGaza had been largely depopulated and rendered completely uninhabitable by\nwidespread destruction.\n\n\u201cThe main thing they\u2019ve done in this war is to empty the north of its people\nand make it almost impossible to live there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is if what they\u2019re doing and have done in the North of Gaza is\npart of a longer term plan to keep that part of the strip under Israeli\noccupation.\u201d\n\nWe asked the IDF about each one of these incidents. They did not respond to\nspecific questions nor did they provide evidence showing why the buildings we\nhighlighted were demolished. They told us the IDF is \u201cdestroying terror\ninfrastructures\u201d embedded in civilian areas and said that in certain cases\nlarge parts of neighbourhoods are converted into combat complexes. They said\nthe IDF is operating in the Gaza Strip to prevent Hamas activity threatening\nIsraeli citizens and implementing a defence plan to improve security in\nsouthern Israel. IDF actions are based on military necessity and in accordance\nwith international law, they said.\n\n\u201cThere is no IDF doctrine that aims [at] causing maximal damage to civilian\ninfrastructure regardless of military necessity,\u201d they said. Adding that\nexceptional incidents occurring during the war will be examined by the General\nStaff\u2019s Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism. \u201cThe IDF addresses exceptional\nincidents that deviate from the order and expected values of IDF soldiers by\nexamining such events and implementing command and disciplinary measures as\nnecessary.\u201d\n\n### \u201cWe\u2019ve Become Addicted to Explosions\u201d The IDF Unit Responsible for\nDemolishing Homes Across Gaza\n\nImage Credits: All footage and images featured in the piece come from social\nmedia posts by members of the 8219 Commando.
