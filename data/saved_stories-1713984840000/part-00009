Don't\nban them!\n\nSaul Howard\n\nApr 24, 2024\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The kids are alright\n\nsaulhoward.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nSocial media, mobile phones, video games and now AI are among the crowning\njewels of human creation. Infinite libraries of information are in everyone's\npocket. Entertaining new formats for instruction and diversion are being\ncreated, not by media institutions, but by ordinary people in their spare\ntime. Children are no longer kept apart from each other in classrooms, but\nhave their own virtual worlds in which to create knowledge and share it.\n\nThe response from our gerontocracy is predictable: ban it.\n\nAs usual, Douglas Adams summed it up:\n\n> I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to\n> technologies:\n>\n>   1. Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary\n> and is just a natural part of the way the world works.\n>\n>   2. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is\n> new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.\n>\n>   3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order\n> of things.\n>\n>\n\nThe truth is that technology is disruptive: it changes societies. In their\ntime, movies, books and even the bicycle all instigated widespread moral\npanic. Bicycles meant that for the first time, young people could easily meet\nfriends under their own steam, the social network technology of their day.\n\nToday, teachers worry about children in their classrooms \"addicted to their\nphones\". So the children aren't paying attention to their lessons, but the\ntruth is many never were. Now instead of sitting at desks like zombies,\nthey're happily engaged in their phones because they have access to something\nthat really interests them.\n\nBut disruptive memes are spreading among children! Well why shouldn't children\nbe allowed to create and disseminate knowledge among their peers? Isn't that\nthe essence of education? Or do we think children should be passive, empty\nvessels into which we pour our approved ideas? If you disagree with the memes\nchildren are sharing, you should make an argument for your position, not shut\ndown the debate.\n\nChildren are using ChatGPT to write their essays! I'm sorry to tell you, but\nadults are using ChatGPT to write their emails and reports. Education needs to\nadapt to the reality that social media is a better way to discover new\ninterests and YouTube is simply a better way to learn basically anything.\n\nThere's another sinister undercurrent to the \"ban social media and AI\"\nplatform. In the case of AI, big tech companies (Google, Facebook, Apple etc.)\nthought at first that AI would be a \"sustaining technology\" - that is, because\nof their ability to invest billions and hire the best engineers, mastery in AI\nwould help to cement their monopolies. But recently, the CEOs have woken up to\na growing realisation that AI might well be a \"disruptive technology\" - as a\ncommodity, AI gives startup companies the ability to challenge Google in\nsearch, Facebook in social media and Apple with the idea that maybe we don't\nall need to use their phones. Their playbook is the same as any other industry\ncartel's: lobby the government to regulate their industries, because\nregulation raises the table stakes to enter the industry so effectively that\nstartups become non-starters. Facebook will happily pay the governments tax to\ncensor their social networks, as the enormous cost of doing so serves to\nprevent any challengers to their business.\n\nNote that, this isn't an argument against allowing the Chinese ownership of\nTikTok. I see real geopolitical reasons why we might not want our media\ncompanies in foreign hands. We have had similar legislation against foreign\nownership of newspapers, for example.\n\nWhile I may not agree, it's wrong to say that there's no argument for some\nregulation of AI. First we should admit that most of the scare stories and\nscenarios presented are already illegal. Why should it be more illegal for a\njudge to be racially biased if the judge is using AI, for example? The call\nfor regulations over issues already covered by existing legislation is a tell-\ntale sign of a monopoly campaigning for cartel protection. I'm told that, out\nof all AI scenarios, politicians are most worried about deepfakes, and that is\na genuinely new capability that perhaps needs oversight. However, lawmakers\nshould be aware that it may not be technically possible to ban video or audio\nthat \"sounds like Rishi Sunak\". More likely, we need to adapt to a world in\nwhich all media is suspect, and learn to use technologies for proving\nprovenance of video and audio.\n\nLawmakers should be very careful of any regulation governing such a fast\nmoving and potentially fruitful technology as AI. If we regulate it out of\nexistence, or make it so that only Google can afford to play, we will never\nknow what possible good we have lost: badly needed medical, educational,\nmilitary and productivity gains are all to play for.\n\nBan children from social media and we stultify them, lock them out of the most\nexciting new technological spaces and prevent them from educating themselves.\n\nThanks for reading 31 Seconds!
