However, these\n> corpora were not created for the quality of Japanese texts. This study\n> builds a large Japanese web corpus by extracting and refining text from the\n> Common Crawl archive (21 snapshots of approximately 63.4 billion pages\n> crawled between 2020 and 2023). This corpus consists of approximately 312.1\n> billion characters (approximately 173 million pages), which is the largest\n> of all available training corpora for Japanese LLMs, surpassing CC-100\n> (approximately 25.8 billion characters), mC4 (approximately 239.7 billion\n> characters) and OSCAR 23.10 (approximately 74 billion characters). To\n> confirm the quality of the corpus, we performed continual pre-training on\n> Llama 2 7B, 13B, 70B, Mistral 7B v0.1, and Mixtral 8x7B Instruct as base\n> LLMs and gained consistent (6.6-8.1 points) improvements on Japanese\n> benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that the improvement on Llama 2 13B\n> brought from the presented corpus was the largest among those from other\n> existing corpora.\n\nComments:| 17 pages  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.17733 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.17733v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Naoaki Okazaki [view email] [v1] Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:02:45 UTC (307 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Building a Large Japanese Web Corpus for Large\nLanguage Models, by Naoaki Okazaki and 9 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
