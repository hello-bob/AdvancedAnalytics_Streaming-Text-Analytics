If you've never seen such\na fort, imagine a series of wooden boards secured to a tree, creating a\nplatform about fifteen feet off the ground where you can sit or stand and walk\naround the tree. This one had a rope ladder we used to get up and down, a\nlength of knotted rope that was tied to the tree at the top and dangled over\nthe edge so that it reached the ground.\n\nOnce you were up in the fort, you could pull the ladder up behind you. It was\nmuch, much harder to get into the fort without the ladder. Not only would you\nneed to climb the tree itself instead of the ladder with its handholds, but\nyou would then reach the underside of the fort and essentially have to do a\npullup and haul your entire body up and over the edge instead of being able to\npull yourself up a foot at a time on the rope. Only then could you let the\nrope back down.\n\nThe rope got pulled up a lot, mostly in games or childhood arguments with each\nother or our siblings. Sometimes it got pulled up out of boredom, fiddling\nwith it or playing with the rope. Sometimes it got pulled up when we were\ntrying to be helpful; it was easier for a younger kid to hold tight to the\nrope while two older kids pulled the rope up to haul the young kid into the\ntree fort.\n\n\"Pulling the ladder up behind you\" is a metaphor for when you intentionally or\nunintentionally remove the easier way by which you reached some height.\n\n## II.\n\nQuoth Ray,\n\n> Weird fact: a lot of people I know (myself included) gained a bunch of\n> agency from running meetups.\n>\n> When I arrived in the NYC community, I noticed an opportunity for some kind\n> of winter holiday. I held the first Solstice. The only stakes were 20 people\n> possibly having a bad time.

I made mistakes, but not ones that\n> ruined anything longterm or important.\n\nI'm a something of a serial inheritor^[1] of meetups.\n\nLast year I ran the Rationalist Megameetup in New York City, which had over a\nhundred people attending and took place at a conference hotel. It's the most\ncomplicated event I've run so far, but it didn't start that way. The first\niteration of the megameetup was, as far as I know, inviting people to hang out\nat a big apartment and letting some of them crash on couches or air mattresses\nthere. That's pretty straightforward and something I can imagine a first-time\norganizer pulling off without too much stress. The first time I ran the\nmegameetup, it involved renting an apartment and taking payments and buying a\nlot of food, but I was basically doing the exact same thing the person before\nme did and I got to ask a previous organizer a lot of questions.\n\nThis means that I got to slowly level up, getting more used to the existing\ntools and more comfortable in what I was doing as I made things bigger. There\nwas a ladder there to let me climb up. If tomorrow I decided to stop having\nanything to do with the Rationalist Megameetup, I'd be leaving whoever picked\nup the torch after me with a harder climb. That problem is only going to get\nworse as the Rationalist Megameetup grows.\n\nProjects have a tendency to grow more complicated the longer they go and the\nmore successful they get. Meetups get bigger as more people join, codebases\nget larger as more features get added, companies wind up with a larger product\nline, fiction series add more characters and plotlines. That makes taking over\nthe project more and more challenging.\n\nWorse, successful projects can inadvertently suck the air out of the space\nwhere new projects would grow and thrive. Take New York City Secular Solstice:\nthere's usually only one per year, which means there's not a natural space for\na new NYC organizer to slowly level up the way Ray did. You could run a small\nSolstice in your living room, but as you tried to grow it larger you'd compete\nmore and more with the the bigger one. The existing solstice has pulled some\nof the rope ladder up behind it, which a newcomer might have used to climb the\nskill ladder.\n\nIt's not all negative, or even most! On balance I think NYC Secular Solstice\nhas actually made things easier. It left a lot of tools behind; a new\norganizer would be able to reuse the existing songs and arc from the resources\npage, they'd be able to estimate attendance based on previous years, all of\nthese are ways to leave a better ladder behind than things started with. Just\nthe existence proof is a valuable rung in the ladder, since now people know\nSecular Solstice is a thing at all and many of them enjoy it.\n\nRationalist Megameetup now, that I need to write more resources for.\n\n## III.\n\nI think about this dynamic and society at large sometimes.\n\nI used to work adjacent to manufacturing and logistics, and the international\nsupply chain is dizzying. How much would someone be able to learn from\nstudying a modern cargo ship if they had to start from scratch? I learned web\ndevelopment back in the days when a pure HTML and CSS website could pass as\nthe low-end of professional, and a little JavaScript and SQL could be added to\nmy repertoire piece by piece. React, Angular, and Vue are more powerful, but I\nlearned them on top of JavaScript! This pattern repeats itself all over the\nplace.\n\nThe best excuse I have for more people spending more time in school is that\nmany fields have gotten more complex over time. The simplest forms of many\ntrades have been out competed by more advanced forms, such that you can't\ngainfully start with the simple version and work your way up. Blacksmithing\nand hand sewn clothes are a hobby, and congratulations to Etsy for maintaining\na path for that hobby to get any income at all. This even feels true for\ngames, though games have an easier time co-existing. LLMs might not be better\nthan the best artists (yet) but they're better than the average artist I see\non Patreon or offering commissions.\n\nWhen I'm feeling pessimistic about government, I notice that nobody who built\nmy government (I'm an American) is around anymore. Each generation added more\nthan they took away, and now the version we're using is bigger than any one\nperson can comprehend. Worse, since the states are more and more alike as the\nfederal government does more and more, I suspect there's less room to practice\nand experiment on lower levels.\n\nThe simple version of government that has been recreated countless times\naround the world is \"Nobody kills anyone else or steals their stuff, or we all\nbeat them up. If there's a disagreement we all tell Chief Bob what happened\nand what Bob says goes.\" I like modern American government a lot more than\nChief Bob, but I notice if I me and my friends tried to start over with the\nChief Bob version we will get thoroughly blocked by the established justice\nsystem. There is something like a path, where you run for Student Government\nin school and then Town Council in a small town and then maybe Mayor, so there\nis a ladder. I haven't climbed it, so I don't know how good it is.\n\nChief Bob's hearings might well be public, held before the whole tribe or at\nleast include the Chief's heirs as an audience.. If that's the case, then the\nnext chief might get to spend years listening to hearings and seeing how they\nturn out before taking Bob's place. In contrast, I don't think I've ever been\npresent for an actual court case, just seen them on TV.\n\nSports leagues do this deliberately. Grade schoolers don't need to worry about\ncompeting with adults, and even college athletes have competitions sheltered\nfrom the professionals. In fencing, there were tournaments where people above\na certain rank and skill weren't allowed to participate, which meant that my\nfirst tournament I was able to win a few bouts. These easier leagues are an\nimportant part of cultivating the next generation of athletes. I actually\nexpect a grade school soccer league to benefit other sports as well; people\nmight learn to enjoy being generally athletic in soccer before shifting to\nsay, rock climbing or paintball. As Ray points out in the quote above, meetups\ncan be a place to gain agency. Nothing says that agency has to keep being\nfocused on meetups.\n\nThe bottom of the rope needs to be in easy arms reach. If there used to be\nsome obvious first step, for some reason the advanced version makes the\nobvious first step not work, and there isn't a good path to figuring out the\nnew version, then someone's gone and pulled the rope up.\n\n## IV.\n\nI think this dynamic is part of why new talent tends to show up in new fields.\n\nWhy be a punk musician in the 70s and 80s? One reason is that Rock and Roll\nwas dominated by established musicians. You might not be able to compete\ndirectly with them, and they'd plucked the low hanging fruit. Why did so many\nentrepreneurs start websites in the 90s and 00s? One reason is that you could\nmake mistakes and learn how business worked without having immediate and\nexperienced competition like you would if you'd started making automobiles.\nWhy did I enjoy playing quidditch so much in college? One reason is that not\nmany other people wanted to play; if I'd joined my college soccer team I'd\nhave probably failed the tryouts and even if I'd passed I'd be up against much\nmore competitive opponents, whereas with quidditch I got to be on the starting\nlineup.\n\nThere can be many genres of music, and people can listen to adjacent and\ngrowing genres as well as the old and established tunes. There can be many\nfiction authors, and readers might go to the bookstore looking for their\nfavourite and wind up picking up another book in the same section of the\nstore. Those are places where the ladder isn't pulled up. Political parties\ntend to squelch nearby parties or split the vote, pulling the ladder up.\n\nNew social movements or groups are an opportunity for the ambitious and\nenergetic. If you're the sort of person who wants to try running something,\nyou may have a much easier time starting your own company rather than working\nyour way up to CEO of an existing company. As Scott Alexander mentions in Can\nThings Be Both Popular and Silenced,\n\n> \"...with the institutional leaders sucking up all the status, it might be\n> harder for some woman who\u2019s just a very good writer and really in-touch with\n> the zeitgeist to say 'Yes, I am the leader of feminism, everyone please care\n> about me now'.\"\n\nThis also explains some of the tendency for groups to fracture over time; the\nnew and agentic find striking out with a splinter group more rewarding than\nworking their way slowly up the chain of command.\n\nOne summary of LessWrong is that it started as a blog for a prolific and\ninteresting writer, who spun off from another established blog. (OBNYC.) One\nsummary of Slate Star Codex and Astral Codex Ten is it started as a blog for a\nprolific and interesting writer, who spun off from another established blog.\n(LessWrong.) One difference is that the software LessWrong was running on made\nit easier for someone else to write a lot and get noticed, in a way that the\nSSC/ACX comments aren't as suited for; even there though, Naval Gazing managed\nto start out as a regular in the SSC comment threads before spinning out into\nits own blog. If someone asked me for advice on becoming widely known and\nrespected as a writer in the rationalist community, I might suggest starting\non LessWrong but I wouldn't suggest staying there indefinitely.\n\n## V.\n\nSo how do you leave a rope ladder behind you, especially if you run something\ncomplicated that you might need to pass off?\n\nThe basic answer is to think of your starting point and try to see where\npast!you would get stuck if they tried to start now. That might vary based on\nthe project and what you're like, so the following are answers for me.\n\nFirst, write down what you did. This is helpful for you (you'd be amazed how\nmuch you can forget if you're not being careful; think of surgeons and\nchecklists) and would be helpful for someone new. Even having a list of things\nthat need done with no instructions is useful, since otherwise someone might\nbe totally ignorant of something that they were expected to do. (Ask me about\nthe 2019 NYC Solstice Afterparty sometime if you want a minor ops horror\nstory.) Publishing the list widely is nice, but even a private and unedited\ngoogle doc you can easily share if someone asks you is nice.\n\nSecond, do it with people. Having someone around to shadow you is an\nundervalued method of transferring knowledge. Work in teams; even if the team\nmembers don't usually talk to each other they can if you need to step back,\nrecreating much of what's going on. That doesn't mean you need to split\ndecision making; apprentice/teacher setups get this benefit as long as the two\ntalk to each other.\n\nThird, whenever possible look for the holes your project doesn't cover and\npoint people towards them. Gaps in government can be filled by local community\norganizations, Winter Solstice need not be run by the same people as Summer\nSolstice, and many is the open source project that could have been a feature\nin a bigger project but instead is a tool the larger project can import while\ngiving the newcomer experience in maintaining a repo.\n\nOn a larger scale, if you're shepherding some vast movement or field, my\nadvice is to deliberately protect the minor leagues. Have forms and spaces\nwhere someone can get a little recognition or authority by stepping up and\nraising their hand, and watch what they do with it. Let them practice in zones\nthat don't have a lot of competition from the established and expert people in\nthe field.\n\nMore than any specific series of steps which are going to be poorly fitting\nfor any number of object level projects or fields, I want to put the concept\nof the ladder in your head. Present rate no singularity, someone will want to\nclimb the ladder after you and unless you are in a competitive business\nenvironment, you probably want them to be successful. Try not to pull the\nladder up behind you.\n\n  1. ^^\n\nA topic I mean to write about more at a later date, but; Rationalist\nMegameetup, Boston regular meetups, ACX Meetup Czar, LessWrong Community\nSurvey, plus partial credit for Boston Solstice and Berkeley ACX Everywhere. I\ndidn't start it, I don't think I would have come up with the idea\nindependently, but someone else stopped doing it and I raised my hand and now\nI've done it and I think done it decently.\n\nCommunity2\n\nCurated\n\n# 138\n\nOn Not Pulling The Ladder Up Behind You\n\n26th Apr 2024\n\n16philh\n\n11Screwtape\n\n4Algon\n\n9Screwtape\n\n2Screwtape\n\n2DiamondSolstice\n\n9Kaj_Sotala\n\n7Screwtape\n\n5Ericf\n\n4Rana Dexsin\n\n3habryka\n\n1complexmeme\n\n1Review Bot\n\nNew Comment\n\n13 comments, sorted by\n\ntop scoring\n\nClick to highlight new comments since: Today at 8:46 PM\n\n[-]philh9d1612\n\n> Ask me about the 2019 NYC Solstice Afterparty sometime if you want a minor\n> ops horror story.\n\nConsider yourself asked.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Screwtape7d110\n\nEpistemic status: memories from five years ago where I was stressed and sleep\ndeprived at the time.\n\nSo, the primary thing I thought the Megameetup did was have overnight space\nfor the people who registered for overnight and space during the day for\npeople who registered for the day. I closed registrations when I thought we\nhad as many people as the space could hold, and made most of my calculations\nand planning based on the number of people who registered. (Mostly food, but\nI'd also been asked to check that certain people the community had had\nproblems with weren't attending.) I knew Solstice was going on that weekend\nand had coordinated a little bit with the Solstice organizer, but mostly just\nto know the time and location so I knew when to send people over.\n\nDuring the weekend- if I remember correctly, this was in the early afternoon\non Saturday, so about five hours before Solstice and while the Megameetup was\nin full swing- people start pointing out that with registration closed, people\nwho just planned to go to the afterparty didn't know if they were supposed to\njust show up or what. I don't remember the exact conversation, but basically\nover the course of about fifteen minutes I realized that lots of people were\nassuming that the megameetup would host Solstice's afterparty, and that an\nunknown number of people were attending Solstice who hadn't registered at all\nwith Megameetup but expected to go to the afterparty.\n\nI have five hours to prepare for an unknown number of people to converge on\nus, when we were already at what I thought was capacity for the venue with a\nlittle safety margin, while simultaneously trying to keep the event I knew I\nwas planning on course. I could try and tell people not to, but lots of people\nincluding my co-organizers have been assuming obviously the afterparty is at\nthe Megameetup and people who went to solstice can come, even if they didn't\ntell Megameetup they were coming, and if Megameetup isn't hosting this then\nsomeone else is probably going to have to try and plan the afterparty with a\ndifferent venue and that's going to be even more complicated.\n\nWe pulled it off, in hindsight I think it was fine, I don't know if anyone who\nwasn't in the room with me when I found this out even realized I didn't plan\non having extra people from Solstice, but I was wound tighter than a drum for\nthe rest of the weekend and that's still the second worst thing that's\nhappened when running a megameetup from my perspective.\n\nThe moral of the story is, leave margins when planning occupancy and capacity\nlimits for an event, and check explicitly and clearly what the expectations\nare when inheriting an event someone else has run before you.\n\n2019's Rationalist Megameetup was. . . special and stressful in many ways,\nactually.\n\nReply1\n\n[-]Algon7d41\n\n> that's still the second worst thing that's happened when running a\n> megameetup from my perspective.\n\nYou can't just say that and not elaborate!\n\nReply\n\n[-]Screwtape7d90\n\nAttendee: knock knock Hey, is the organizer in there?\n\nMe: Yeah, what's up?\n\nAttendee: The fire department is here, and we think an attendee just left in\nan ambulance but we're not sure who or why.\n\nMe: . . . I'll be right out.\n\nAnd that's the most stressful thing that's ever happened to me as an event\norganizer.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Screwtape7d20\n\nA history of the NYC Rationalist Megameetup is in my drafts.

I like the ladder metaphor.\n\nFor events, one saving grace is that many people actively dislike events\ngetting too large and having too many people, and start to long for the\nsmaller cozier version at that point. So instead of the bigger event competing\nwith the smaller one and drawing people away from it, it might actually work\nthe other way around, with the smaller event being that one that \"steals\"\npeople from the bigger one.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Screwtape9d70\n\nThank you! You're right, \"nobody goes there, it's too crowded\" is an effect\nthat keeps the ladder unfurled, as is a kind of cohort dynamic I don't have as\ngood a conceptual handle for^[1]. This post is mostly talking about meetups\nbecause they're on my mind a lot and I had the examples handy. Ideally, the\nbig and the small and the old and the new can reinforce and help each other,\nand sometimes that works. Other times, we get the pulled up ladder.\n\n  1. ^^\n\nat a first pass description, sometimes there's no public meetup so someone\nstarts one, meets a bunch of new people who don't have connections, makes\nfriends, start having their friends over for dinner or going to museums and\nthey're too busy to run the public meetups and don't need to because they have\ntheir social needs met. Then after a year or two of no public meetups, someone\nnew starts one, and the cycle repeats, so you have multiple groups that don't\nintermix as much as one might hope.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Ericf10d50\n\nRelated content: https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=168\n\nReply\n\n[-]Rana Dexsin10d40\n\nIn less serious (but not fully unserious) citation of that particular site, it\nalso contains an earlier depiction of literally pulling up ladders (as part of\na comic based on treating LOTR as though it were a D&D campaign) that shows\noff what can sometimes result: a disruptive shock from the ones stuck on the\nlower side, in this case via a leap in technology level.\n\nReply\n\n[-]habryka12h31\n\nPromoted to curated: I liked this post.

The kind of post that on the margin I would\nlike to see a bunch more off (I wouldn't want it to be the only thing on\nLessWrong, but it feels like the kind of thing LW used to excel at, and now is\nonly dabbling in, and that seems quite sad).\n\nReply\n\n[-]complexmeme6h10\n\n> Chief Bob's hearings might well be public[...] I don't think I've ever been\n> present for an actual court case, just seen them on TV.\n\nThis seems to me like an odd example given that you're contrasting with\nAmerican government, where court hearings are almost entirely public, written\nopinions are generally freely available, and court transcripts are generally\npublic (though not always accessible for free). I guess the steelman version\nis that the contrast is a matter of geography or scale? Chief Bob's hearings\nare in your neighborhood and involve your neighbors, whereas your local court\nmight be across town during the business day and involve disputes between\npeople you don't know. But the American judicial system is a lot more\naccessible than it plausibly could be while still fulfilling its core\nfunction.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Review Bot5d10\n\nThe LessWrong Review runs every year to select the posts that have most stood\nthe test of time.
