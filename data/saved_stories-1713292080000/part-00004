He said he put his foot firmly on the brake, stopped the car and\nrealized that a rubber cover attached to the accelerator had come loose,\npinning the pedal down. He said he had the car for six days total.\n\nOver the weekend, Martinez heard that some Cybertruck deliveries had been\npaused, he said in a phone interview with NBC News. On Sunday morning, he made\na TikTok video showing the issue with his accelerator. As of Monday afternoon,\nMartinez\u2019s video had been viewed almost 2 million times on TikTok and almost 6\nmillion times on X, the social media website purchased and renamed from\nTwitter by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\n\u201cThe moment I let go of the brake, it would lurch forward at full throttle\nagain,\u201d Martinez told NBC News. \u201cI had space where I could figure out what was\ngoing on. It wasn\u2019t a situation where there were cars in front of me or a\nbuilding or a tree.\u201d\n\nVarious Tesla news sources have reported at least a weeklong pause in some\nCybertruck deliveries related to an accelerator issue. Cybertruck enthusiasts\non an owners forum have described getting calls alerting them to delays on\ntheir deliveries for an unknown amount of time related to an accelerator\nissue.\n\nTesla has not announced any official recall or pause and did not immediately\nrespond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Martinez\u2019s case, he said he found he could continue driving the Cybertruck\nwithout the accelerator cover. He said he plans to fiddle around with it more\nduring his next day off from working in car sales. Before the incident,\nMartinez said he drove the Cybertruck for more than 2,000 miles, in a trip to\nSan Francisco and back.\n\n\u201cOther than this, it\u2019s a pretty solidly built car,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI know\nsaying \u2018other than this\u2019 makes it sound like it\u2019s not major, and it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it is such a massive car, and it\u2019s got such a great amount of power,\nI do feel like things in regard to safety definitely need to be a priority in\ngetting it addressed and fixed,\u201d he added.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which\ntracks recalls, investigations and complaints, said in a statement to CNBC\nthat \"NHTSA is aware of this issue and is in contact with the manufacturer to\ngather additional information.\"\n\nTesla previously initiated a voluntary recall of its vehicles in January 2024,\nincluding the Cybertruck, in order to make the font size on their touchscreens\nmore readable.\n\nIn December, the NHTSA told CNBC that it contacted Tesla after a YouTube car\nreviewer claimed that the sharp edges on the Cybertruck cut his hand.\n\nPreviously, safety experts have raised concerns about the car\u2019s speed, weight\nand sharp edges.\n\n### Recommended\n\nBusiness News\n\n### Business NewsApple loses top phonemaker spot to Samsung as iPhone\nshipments drop, research company says\n\nTech News\n\n### Tech NewsDemocratic tech group aims to shake up Republican statehouses in\n2024\n\nThe first car accident involving a Cybertruck was reported in California in\nDecember. A Toyota Corolla crashed into a Cybertruck, and while the Tesla\ndriver sustained a minor injury, the Corolla appeared to be much more damaged\nthan the Cybertruck in photos.\n\nAt least one anonymous person previously posted on a Cybertruck owners forum\nabout an issue with their accelerator and brake, saying they crashed into a\npole. NBC News could not contact the user or independently verify their story.\nOther forum members cast doubt on their story and have expressed skepticism\nabout Martinez\u2019s TikTok video.\n\nThe Cybertruck has been marketed as extremely durable and high-performing,\ngenerating intense interest and scrutiny of the vehicle and its rollout.\n\nDuring the Cybertruck\u2019s launch event in 2019, the car\u2019s \u201cunbreakable\u201d glass\nwindow shattered. Still, the car quickly became a status symbol and object of\ncultural hype, and numerous examples of Cybertrucks on the road have made a\nsplash on social media. Some celebrities, like Kim Kardashian, have flaunted\nthem. In January, there were more than 2 million reservations to potentially\norder the Cybertruck, according to Barron's.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, I was sitting at the computer watching the reveal,\u201d Martinez\nsaid. \u201cI thought it looked cool, so I put the deposit down that same night.\u201d\n\nBut Martinez said he isn\u2019t a Tesla \u201cfanboy,\u201d adding, \u201cMy perception of Elon\nMusk a few years ago, versus my perception of him now, has changed.\u201d\n\nMartinez\u2019s video and the reported delays come at a tumultuous time for Tesla.\n\nMusk announced Monday morning that Tesla would be laying off more than 10% of\nits global headcount.\n\nIn an email sent to the company, obtained by CNBC and NBC News, Musk wrote:\n\u201cOver the years, we have grown rapidly with multiple factories scaling around\nthe globe. With this rapid growth there has been duplication of roles and job\nfunctions in certain areas. As we prepare the company for our next phase of\ngrowth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for\ncost reductions and increasing productivity.\u201d\n\nKat Tenbarge\n\nKat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News Digital.
