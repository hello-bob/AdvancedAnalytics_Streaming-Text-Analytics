Across the region as a whole the five-day temperature\nwas increased by 1.4C.\n\n\"For some, a heatwave being 1.4 or 1.5C hotter because of climate change might\nnot sound like a big increase,\" said Kiswendsida Guigma, a climate scientist\nat the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in Burkina Faso.\n\nGetty Images\n\nSenegal has a long experience of heatwaves and is seeing decreasing rainfall\nas a result of climate change\n\n\"But this additional heat would have been the difference between life and\ndeath for many people.\"\n\nWhile intense heatwaves are still relatively rare in this region, researchers\nexpect them to become more common as the climate warms.\n\nWith average global temperatures now around 1.2C warmer than pre-industrial\nlevels, scientists say events like this recent one in Mali would occur once in\n200 years. But if global temperatures breach 2C, powerful heatwaves would\nhappen every 20 years.\n\nWhile the fingerprints of humanity are on this event, it's not the same for\nthe serious drought that has hit countries in southern Africa early this year.\n\nLow rainfall saw crop failures in several countries leading to an estimated\n20m people facing hunger. Water shortages in Zambia and Zimbabwe saw outbreaks\nof cholera with states of disaster declared in both countries as well as in\nneighbouring Malawi.\n\nResearchers looked at temperature and rainfall data to determine the causes of\nthe drought.\n\nThey found that climate change did not have a significant influence on low\nrainfall during the December- February period across the region.\n\nInstead, they believe that the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon was to blame.\n\nThis upwelling of warm water in the Pacific is linked to impacts on weather in\nmany locations.\n\nThe current El Ni\u00f1o peaked in December, and researchers say it made rainfall\nacross southern Africa very scarce.\n\nWhile a warmer world would see droughts like this occur once every ten years,\nthe scientists found that droughts were twice as likely to occur in an El Ni\u00f1o\nyear.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMany countries in southern Africa have experienced a prolonged dry period in\nthe early part of this year\n\n\"Over the past year, attribution studies have shown that many extreme weather\nevents have been driven by a combination of both climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\nsaid Joyce Kimutai, a researcher at Imperial College London.\n\n\"The southern Africa drought appears to be a rarer example of an event fuelled\nprimarily by El Ni\u00f1o.\"\n\nDrought\n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\nParis climate agreement\n\nClimate\n\nRelated\n\n## Drought causes power cuts in Ecuador\n\n2 days ago\n\nLatin America & Caribbean\n\nWATCH\n\n## Colombians grapple with water cuts\n\n7 days ago\n\nLatin America & Caribbean\n\n## Four-minute showers - a parched Bogota rations water\n\n7 days ago\n\nLatin America & Caribbean\n\nMore\n\n6 hrs ago\n\n## New sea defence protects promenade, rail, and road\n\nThe huge new stone defences in the \u00a335m scheme will absorb the power of the\nroughest seas.\n\n6 hrs ago\n\nWales\n\n13 hrs ago\n\n## Scottish government scraps climate change targets\n\nThe annual and interim climate targets will be replaced with a system\nmeasuring emissions every five years.\n\n13 hrs ago\n\nScotland\n\n13 hrs ago\n\n## 2030 climate target 'out of reach', says minister\n\nScotland\u2019s net zero minister ditches the target of reducing greenhouse gas\nemissions by 75% by 2030.\n\n13 hrs ago\n\nScotland\n\n16 hrs ago\n\n## Scrapped climate target is global embarrassment - charities\n\nMinisters are expected to confirm that the aim of reducing emissions by 75% by\n2030 has been dropped.\n\n16 hrs ago\n\nScotland\n\n18 hrs ago\n\n## Nature becomes a musician, starts making royalties\n\nArtists who add natural sounds to their songs can now split the royalties with\nenvironmental causes.\n\n18 hrs ago\n\nEntertainment & Arts\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
