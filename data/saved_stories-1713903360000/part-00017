Five thousand miles away, youth from Just Stop Oil throw soup on\nthe painting \u201cSunflowers\u201d by Vincent Van Gogh at the National Gallery in\nLondon in 2022. They yell as reporters film them, \u201cWhat is more important? Art\nor life?\u201d Three hundred miles away, in 2024, activist Greta Thunberg twists in\nthe arms of the police as she and others are arrested for blocking a road to\nThe Hague to protest the Dutch government\u2019s tax giveaways to oil companies.\n\nThe climate crisis is radicalizing youth. Tech savvy and globally connected,\nGen Z and Millennial activists are becoming increasingly militant as runaway\nfossil fuel development destroys their future. They attained early victories.\nThey have put ecocide, the utter razing of nature, at the forefront of\npolitics. They drew global attention with protests. They sued governments and\nwon. The wins fly in the face of an older generation of corrupt politicians,\npaid off by the oil industry.\n\nYet the danger of environmental breakdown threatens to overwhelm their initial\nvictories. Climate refugees pour across borders. A global network of fascism\nis trying to dismantle democracy and snuff out civil society.\n\nYoung climate activists are at a turning point. Faced with an unlivable future\nand caught in a bleak present, they push and push and push. They have no\nchoice. They are fighting for their lives.\n\n## The Shadow of the Future\n\nThe kids are not alright. They are very, very scared. A worldwide survey by\nBath University showed teens and young adults look at the years ahead and\ntremble. Researchers collected over 10,000 responses across 10 countries and\nfound young people felt anxious and \u201cbetrayed by their governments.\u201d\nHelplessness and anger permeated Gen Z and Millennials from Nigeria to\nPortugal, from the Philippines to the United States. The anxiety is highest\nwhere the risk is greatest: in the Global South.\n\n### Related Story\n\nOp-Ed\n\n|\n\nEnvironment & Health\n\n## Biden\u2019s Backing of Pipelines Is a Slap in the Face to Youth Who Voted for\nHim\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s blatant hypocrisy on fossil fuel infrastructure is an insult\nto young people\u2019s intelligence.\n\nBy\n\n    Mariah Clay ,\n    Truthout\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nTruthout\n\nImagine how it feels to be 16 years old and growing up with the climate crisis\nhanging over your head. You look around and see cars and airplanes spewing\ncarbon. You see plastic bottles spill from trash cans and garbage floating in\nthe river. You hear about or directly experience catastrophic weather events\nwith each passing season. A deep hopelessness fills your heart. Everywhere you\nlook and everyone you see is racing to enjoy the good life now even though it\nis your death sentence. No one seems to care enough to stop.\n\nMany youth have been traumatized by the destruction of their homes and forced\nmigration. Driving through a wildfire is terrifying. Watching your home\nflooded and your memories wrecked is emotionally devastating. The World Bank\nestimates that by 2050, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia\nwill produce 143 million climate migrants, according to the Brookings\nInstitution. Each family that leaves their home carries more than their\nbackpacks and children \u2014 they carry the pain of being wrenched from their\nlives. A traumatized person\u2019s nervous system is like a tree ripped from the\nearth with roots exposed and raw.\n\nHow do youth replant themselves into a future that crumbles into dust? Fight.\nFight. Fight.\n\n## Getting Into the Ring\n\nYelling at the top of their lungs, youth activists blocked the road to Vice\nPresident Kamala Harris\u2019s Los Angeles home. They held bright signs that read,\n\u201cFund Climate Action! Not Genocide!\u201d referencing Israel\u2019s ongoing assault on\nGaza. Forty protesters with the Sunrise Movement chanted fiercely as cops\narrested six who sat on the road and refused to move. One said to LA Times\nreporters, \u201cMy generation is spending our teenage years organizing for climate\naction because people like Kamala Harris have failed us!\u201d\n\n> Climate activists had put more than 2,180 cases on the docket as of late\n> 2022.\n\nTransforming anxiety into action, youth across the world have surged into\nenvironmental groups from the mainstream to the militant. The umbrella\norganization Youth Climate Movement, which at first focused on school strikes\nand marches, has now scaled up to demand deep systemic change. The group needs\nfunding. They are wrestling with tactics. Some youth leaders speak at global\nconferences like the United Nations\u2019 COP28. Others grind teeth, impatient with\nyet another can-kicking summit, wanting more direct action.\n\nScrappier and more in-your-face groups like the Sunrise Movement and\nExtinction Rebellion lead the charge. Sunrise is a 501(c)(4) political action\norganization that first made headlines in 2018 by staging a sit-in at the\noffice of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It has grown into a powerhouse with\n$13 million in funding, 400 hubs across the country and a vision to get a\nGreen New Deal passed. Their activists hound Democrats, which has drawn the\nire of centrist Democrats who get huffy, with one saying anonymously, \u201cthe\nextremism ... is the reason that even a lot of moderate, thoughtful people are\nannoyed with environmentalists.\u201d Yet what drives youth climate activists is\ndesperation at a future going up in flames. Sunrise Executive Director\nVarshini Prakash sighed in despair at the failure of President Joe Biden\u2019s\nBuild Back Better, \u201cIt\u2019s like, we voted, we marched, we striked, you know?\nThere were, like, 16-year-olds doing phone banks. What more do we need to do\nto win?\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion is a United Kingdom-based group that gets rowdy in the\nstreets. Using nonviolent direct action, the group staged attention-grabbing\nprotests: occupying Greenpeace offices in 2018, blocking bridges across the\nriver Thames and, even more recently, upstaging a Broadway play, Henrik\nIbsen\u2019s \u201cAn Enemy of the People.\u201d An activist stood up in the theater and\nyelled, \u201cI am against the silencing of scientists\u201d and walked out wearing an\nExtinction Rebellion shirt. Two others disrupted the play later.\n\nMore recently, Greta Thunberg joined Extinction Rebellion for a protest at The\nHague. One of the group\u2019s co-founders, Roger Hallam, was arrested and given a\nsuspended sentence for planning to stop airplanes at Heathrow Airport using a\ndrone. The organization also recently protested at the Science Museum in\nLondon, with more actions planned for the summer.\n\nAdd to this the legal victories that youth climate activists are notching. In\n2023, a Montana judge ruled that the state violated the rights of its young\ncitizens by allowing fossil fuel companies to destroy the environment. In\nanother case called Genesis B. v. EPA, 18 teens from California sued the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency for \u201cfailing to protect them from climate\nchange.\u201d Around the world, legal cases are mounting. Climate activists had put\nmore than 2,180 cases on the docket as of late 2022. The goal is to create a\nlegal infrastructure that, alongside protest, allows civil society actors to\nstop governments and fossil fuel companies from colluding to eviscerate the\nenvironment for profit while people die.\n\nThe risk, of course, is that legal tactics can fail. In June 2023, the U.S.\nSupreme Court gutted the EPA\u2019s ability to curtail carbon emissions, and\ncontinues to roll back the agency\u2019s power. Against the legal and political\nwall, climate activists are becoming desperate. Youth go on hunger strikes.\nYouth get arrested in nonviolent protests. Youth make connections between\nclimate change and racial justice movements. Youth call and knock on doors and\nhost teach-ins and spread memes and march and go vegan and stop taking\nairplanes and get arrested again.\n\nAll of this \u2014 and yet the progress is too slow: 2023 may have been the last\nyear below the \u201ckey climate threshold\u201d of 1.5 degrees Celsius, and other\nhistorical calamities are continuing to unfold in the global environment.\n\nHints of another direction bubble up in popular media. A 2023 film, How to\nBlow Up a Pipeline based on the book of the same name by Andreas Malm, showed\na small crew of youth climate activists blowing up an oil pipeline and\npublicly taking credit. The internet is littered with hand-wringing articles\non the possibility of desperate activists turning to property destruction like\nthe Earth Liberation Front of the 1990s. Critics fear such a turn will\nalienate middle-class sympathizers and stall the movement.\n\nYouth climate activists are between a rock and a hard place. They see their\nfuture on fire. They know people are suffering and dying right now from\nclimate change. They watch as millions flee drought and monsoons, begging at\nthe borders of the Global North for safety.\n\nThey fight to save themselves. They fight to save life on Earth, the only\nplanet in the vast universe that we know harbors it. They fight by the rules\nof a rigged game. How long before they throw the rules out?\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
