Here we present a highly reactive air- and\nmoisture-stable ruthenium precatalyst [(^tBuCN)_5Ru(H_2O)](BF_4)_2, featuring\na key exchangeable water ligand. This versatile precatalyst drives an array of\ntransformations, including late-stage C(sp^2)\u2013H arylation, primary/secondary\nalkylation, methylation, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, C(sp^3)\u2013H oxidation,\nalkene isomerization and oxidative cleavage, consistently outperforming\nconventionally used ruthenium (pre)catalysts. The generality and applicability\nof this precatalyst is exemplified through the potential for rapid screening\nand optimization of photocatalytic reactions with a suite of in situ generated\nruthenium photocatalysts containing hitherto unknown complexes, and through\nthe rapid discovery of reactivities previously unreported for ruthenium. The\ndiverse applicability observed is suggestive of a generic platform for\nreaction simplification and accelerated synthetic discovery that will enable\nbroader applicability and accessibility to state-of-the-art ruthenium\ncatalysis.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Asymmetric photoredox catalytic formal de Mayo reaction enabled by\nsensitization-initiated electron transfer\n\nArticle 02 April 2024\n\nXin Sun, Yilin Liu, ...

One crucial aspect\nof these advances has been the advent of robust catalysts that can be easily\nused and that operate under mild conditions, broadening their utility and\napplicability^3,4. For example, the versatility of complexes such as palladium\nacetate or bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0), and their ability to form in situ new\ncomplexes, have been pivotal in shaping the development of palladium^5,6 and\nnickel catalysis, respectively^7,8. Ruthenium catalysts have exhibited\npowerful versatility for a broad selection of applications^9. For example, a\nvariety of synthetically powerful C\u2013H functionalization reactions has been\ndemonstrated using ruthenium catalysis^10,11. However, despite their\nwidespread utility, many of the developed protocols have necessitated either\nhigh reaction temperatures (80\u2013140 \u00b0C) or light irradiation, which has limited\noverall ease of use and their suitability for the diversification of delicate\nhigh-complexity substrates and biomolecules^12. This is a common occurrence\nwhen widely applied \u03b7^6-arene coordinated ruthenium species such as\n[(p-cymene)RuCl_2]_2 1 (ref. ^13) and benzene analogue 2 are used, as they\ntypically require additional energy to access active catalyst species (Fig.\n1a).\n\nFig. 1: Design and synthesis of an air- and moisture-stable ruthenium(II)\nprecatalyst.\n\na, Selection of ruthenium(II) precatalysts typically used for application,\ndiscovery and synthetic method development within C\u2013H functionalization\nchemistry. Broadly available air-stable precatalysts such as 1 and 2 exhibit\npoor levels of reactivity under mild reaction conditions and have high\nbarriers that must be overcome to form active catalysts. Preactivated\ncomplexes such as 4 and 5 are highly reactive and operate under mild\nconditions but are extremely air sensitive. The air-stable complex\n[(^tBuCN)_5Ru(H_2O)](BF_4)_2 (3) provides an alternative that has broad\nreactivity without the need for harsh reaction conditions. b, Left: synthesis\nof complex 3 by zinc reduction of ruthenium(III) trichloride and chloride-to-\ntetrafluoroborate metathesis.

Yield was determined by ^19F NMR using\n1,4-difluorobenzene as an internal standard. r.t., room temperature.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn 2018, we reported the development of a monocyclometallated ruthenium\ncatalyst, [(C_6H_4CH_2NMe_2)Ru(MeCN)_4]PF_6 4, that showed high activity at\nmoderate temperatures (35\u201350 \u00b0C) for the C(sp^2)\u2013H arylation of arenes^12.\nThis precatalyst allowed for the direct late-stage C(sp^2)\u2013H arylation and\nalkylation of a wide array of pharmaceuticals and other biologically relevant\nmolecules. Despite its powerful reactivity, the considerable air sensitivity\nof 4 has limited its synthetic applicability, requiring specialized storage\nand handling techniques that have prevented general adoption in most synthetic\nlaboratories and within industrial settings. Key to any broadly applicable\nsynthetic innovation is the use of operationally simple reagents and\nprecatalysts that enable use by both the specialist and non-expert scientist.\n\nConsidering these limitations, the development of air-stable precatalysts with\nsimilar transformative power as air-sensitive complexes such as 4 is critical\nfor increasing the accessibility and use of ruthenium catalysis. Therefore, we\nquestioned the feasibility of designing a synthetically accessible precatalyst\nthat would contain a balanced selection of ligands with varied labilities that\nwould be both air- and moisture-stable and possess high levels of native\nreactivity. In this article, we present the development and broad\napplicability of an air- and moisture-stable ruthenium precatalyst,\n[(^tBuCN)_5Ru(H_2O)](BF_4)_2 \u2018RuAqua\u2019 3, which displays a similar reactivity\nprofile in C(sp^2)\u2013H functionalization to air-sensitive monocyclometallated\ncomplexes 4 and 5, and does not require strict air-free handling or storage.\nImportantly, the versatility of RuAqua 3 extends to a diverse suite of\nsynthetic transformations, including C\u2013H functionalization, alkene\nisomerization, alkene oxidative cleavage and reductive transformations.\nMoreover, the labile ligand sphere allows for facile photocatalyst formation\nvia mechanochemical milling, and additionally enables the rapid screening,\noptimization and selection of photocatalysts through in situ generation of\nphotocatalyst species. The ease of use of RuAqua 3 should provide access to a\nbroad suite of ruthenium-catalysed transformations to the widest possible\nuserbase.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Design, synthesis and stability of RuAqua\n\nSuccessful realization of an air- and moisture-stable ruthenium precatalyst\nthat imparted comparable levels of reactivity to that observed for\nmonocyclometallated complexes such as 4 and 5 hinged on the design of a\nsuitably balanced ligand set. The selected ligand framework would be key to\nrender the resulting complex air- and moisture-stable but at the same time\nallow for facile access to catalytically active species in the presence of\nadded substrates or reagents. From our previous work, we mechanistically\nposited that cyclometallated complex 4 underwent precatalyst activation from\nrapid ligand exchange when excess directing group arenes were added^12. Guided\nby this hypothesis, we considered that a hexaaquaruthenium(II) complex\ncontaining six water ligands, that is, [Ru(H_2O)_6]^2+, could be a suitable\nstarting point because monodentate aqua ligands are generally more labile than\nother strongly coordinating heteroatom donors or multidentate ligand\nframeworks. Given the high exchange rate constant observed for aqua ligands\nwithin [Ru(H_2O)_6]^2+ (k = 1.8 \u00d7 10^\u22122 s^\u22121), the use of this class of\ncomplex would conceptually allow for rapid precatalyst activation by fast\nsequential ligand exchange reactions^14. However, Ludi and co-workers\npreviously reported that hexaaquaruthenium(II) complexes underwent rapid\noxidation in an aqueous solution and thus indicated that these species were\nnot stable to atmospheric oxygen^15.\n\nWe previously reported the use of an air- and moisture-stable\nhexakis(pivalonitrile)ruthenium(II) complex [Ru(^tBuCN)_6](BF_4)_2 for the C\u2013H\nfunctionalization of benzoic acid derivatives, fluoroarenes and arenes bearing\nnitrogen-based directing groups^16,17. However, in each of these applications\nthis complex required high reaction temperatures to enable precatalyst\nactivation by thermally induced ligand exchange. The necessity for elevated\nreaction temperatures is coherent with the low nitrile ligand exchange rate\nconstant observed for the analogous hexakis-acetonitrile complex\n[Ru(MeCN)_6]^2+ (k = 8.9 \u00d7 10^\u221211 s^\u22121), that is, eight orders of magnitude\nslower than that of the corresponding aqua complex^14.\n\nTo apply this knowledge, we considered an alternative precatalyst design using\na hybrid mixed ligand set that consisted of both nitrile and aqua ligands. We\nreasoned that aqua ligands contained within any complex would essentially\nserve as pseudo-vacant sites to enable rapid reactivity and provide facile\naccess to catalytically active species. Combined with the additional stability\nbestowed by nitrile ligands, this mixed ligand sphere design would confer both\nhigh levels of stability and reactivity in the presence of Lewis basic\nreactants.\n\nTo evaluate this hypothesis, we required synthetic access to a complex bearing\na hybrid combination of both nitrile and aqua ligands. Therefore, we proceeded\nto synthesize a nitrile-containing complex starting with the zinc reduction of\ncommercially available ruthenium(III) trichloride hydrate in pivalonitrile\n(^tBuCN) as a solvent to give a putative ruthenium(II) dichloride intermediate\nbearing four pivalonitrile ligands. From here, the non-isolated intermediate\nspecies was subjected to reaction with excess silver tetrafluoroborate that\nproceeded in water to give [(^tBuCN)_5Ru(H_2O)](BF_4)_2 (3) following\nmetathesis and ligand redistribution in 49% yield (Fig. 1b). Notably, this\nprocedure could be conducted on a decagramme scale to generate >26 g of\ncomplex 3. The air- and moisture-stability of complex 3 was directly compared\nwith that of cyclometallated species 4 and 5 (Fig. 1c). Whereas visible\ndegradation of solid samples of sensitive complexes 4 and 5 was observed\nwithin hours, the mixed hybrid complex 3 showed robust tolerance to air\n(stable >1 year). Similarly, while benzylamine containing cyclometallated\ncomplex 4 decomposes in oxygenated solutions at room temperature within\nminutes, 3 proved stable to the open air in acetone, dichloromethane and\nmethanol solutions (Supplementary Table 1). Additional characterization,\nincluding ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and\nthermogravimetric analysis, was conducted to further understand the physical\nproperties of complex 3 (Supplementary Information, pages 14\u201320). With the\nstability of 3 established, the second key design criteria of reactivity under\nmild conditions was tested by direct application to C(sp^2)\u2013H bond activation\n(Fig. 1d). Specifically, the reaction of 3 with phenylpyridine derivative 6\nwas achieved under mild reaction conditions (40 \u00b0C) to give biscyclometallated\nspecies 7 (80%, 4 h). Taken together, the stability of 3 and the ability to\neasily participate in C(sp^2)\u2013H bond activation without excessive applied heat\nor light irradiation was indicative of a viable and generally applicable\nalternative to many predecessor precatalysts.\n\n### RuAqua as a precatalyst for C(sp ^2)\u2013H functionalization\n\nGiven that 3 was compatible with stoichiometric C(sp^2)\u2013H bond activation, the\ntrue test of utility was the application of substoichiometric quantities of 3\nas a precatalyst to a range of synthetic transformations. Therefore, we\ninitially targeted arene C(sp^2)\u2013H arylation using aryl halide electrophiles\nas coupling partners (Table 1)^12. Direct arylation of 2-(o-tolyl)pyridine 8a\nusing 5-bromo-m-xylene 9a proceeded using 3 (5 mol%) as a precatalyst under\nmild heating (40 \u00b0C) to selectively give arylated product 10a in excellent\nyield (92%). Notably, the analogous reaction using 4-iodoanisole 9b could be\nperformed within an industrial setting (AstraZeneca) on a 5 g scale using\ndimethylcarbonate as the solvent in 78% yield (Supplementary Information,\npages 26\u201327). This reactivity underscores the practical superiority and\nadvantage of RuAqua 3 in comparison to predecessor precatalysts. Precatalyst 3\nfurther demonstrated applicability to the direct late-stage functionalization\nof 8a using a selection of biologically active molecules, including\nhaloperidol 9c, chlormezanone 9d, chlorpropham 9e and Ladasten 9f. Similarly,\nthe identity of the directing-group arene was varied to utilize the\nbenzodiazepine motif within diazepam 8b, and the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine group\nof zolimidine 8c. In both cases, 8b and 8c underwent arylation with aryl\nhalide electrophiles to give 11g and 11h in excellent yields (86% and 95%).\nThe drug\u2013drug conjugate 10i was effectively synthesized in useful yield (50%)\nthrough the direct coupling of zolpidem derivative 8d with clozapine 9h. In\neach reaction using biologically active molecules as coupling partners, the\nprocedure using 3 as a precatalyst selectively gave the coupled products in\nexcellent yields and as single regioisomers.\n\nTable 1 Precatalyst applicability for the direct C(sp^2)\u2013H bond arylation of\ndirecting-group arenes using (pseudeo)halide electrophiles under mild reaction\nconditions\n\nFull size table\n\nApplicability of 3 as a precatalyst was further extended beyond C(sp^2)\u2013H\narylation to include ortho-selective C(sp^2)\u2013H alkylation with a selection of\nboth primary and secondary halide electrophiles (Table 2, upper)^18,19. Using\nthe primary alkyl halide n-octylbromide 12a, alkylation of several unique\ndirecting-group arenes was achieved. Specifically, successful ortho-selective\nalkylation was achieved in good to excellent yields giving products including\naryl-pyridine 14a, aryl-pyrimidine 14b, aryl-isoquinoline 14c, aryl-pyrazole\n14d, diazepam 14e and aryl-ketone 14f motifs. Similar applicability was\nobserved in the ortho-selective alkylation using secondary alkyl bromides\n(Table 2, lower). A bromide derivative of oxaprozin 13a containing a bromo-\npiperidine group underwent successful alkylation of 2-(o-tolyl)pyridine 8a to\ngive 15a in good yield and as a single regioisomer. Similarly, pyrimidine 8f\nwas selectively alkylated using 4-bromotetrahydro-2H-pyran 13b to give\npyrimidine derivative 15b in excellent yield. Substrates bearing increased\nlevels of structural complexity were also applicable to secondary ortho-\nselective alkylation. For example, diazepam 8b underwent ortho-alkylation\nusing 4-bromotetrahydro-2H-pyran 13b in moderate yield giving 15c in 36%\nyield, and bromo-substituted epiandrosterone derivative 13c was coupled with\n8j in excellent yield to give 15d as a single diastereomer. Attempts to carry\nout these reactions with RuCl_3 or ruthenium complex 1 led to low or no\nreactivity under the same reaction conditions (see 10d, 14c and 15b).\n\nTable 2 Precatalyst applicability for the direct C(sp^2)\u2013H bond alkylation of\ndirecting-group arenes using halide electrophiles under mild reaction\nconditions\n\nFull size table\n\nConsidering the catalytic capability and tolerance of RuAqua 3 when applied to\nC(sp^2)\u2013H bond coupling of complex molecules containing extensive functional\ngroup diversity, it was plausible to further expand this class of reactivity.\nWe previously reported a mild synthetic strategy for the direct C(sp^2)\u2013H bond\nmethylation of arenes bearing nitrogen-based directing groups using\nN,N,N-trimethylanilinium salts^20. The developed procedure used air-sensitive\nprecatalyst 4 to achieve ortho-selective arene methylation. Therefore, RuAqua\n3 was tested as an air-stable alternative under comparable reaction conditions\nto that found optimal for 4 (Fig. 2a). Using electron-deficient anilinium\ntriflate 16 as a source of methyl-coupling partner, the direct methylation of\naryl-pyrimidine 8k (17a), aryl-pyridine 8l (17b), aryl-isoquinoline 8g (17c)\nand diazepam 8b (17d) was achieved, giving products in good yields.\nApplication to an aryl-pyridine bearing a structurally complex oestrone unit\n8m was additionally achieved in excellent yield (17e).\n\nFig. 2: RuAqua 3 as a precatalyst for selective ortho- and monoselective arene\nmethylation and applicability to distal meta-functionalization.\n\na, Ruthenium-catalysed ortho-selective C(sp^2)\u2013H methylation using\ntrimethylanilinium salt 16. b, Meta-selective C(sp^2)\u2013H functionalization\nreactions. Applicability of 3 as a precatalyst for meta-selective alkylation\nwas demonstrated using tertiary alkyl halides, an \u03b1-bromoester (to give 19b),\nKatritzky salt 20 and using tandem-radical cyclization substrate 21.

For\nexample, primary alkyl electrophiles and aryl electrophiles have shown a\nstrong bias for ortho-C(sp^2)\u2013H functionalization^12,18,19. Contrastingly,\nruthenium catalysis using tertiary alkyl halides has demonstrated a propensity\nfor meta-selective addition^21,22,23. Predominantly, this class of reactions\nhas been facilitated through the use of \u03b7^6-arene containing precatalysts such\nas [(p-cymene)RuCl_2]_2 1, and at high temperatures or under continuous light\nirradiation. We therefore queried if RuAqua 3 could serve as a suitable\nprecatalyst for meta-selective alkylation, and if this reactivity could be\nachieved under milder conditions than had been used previously (Fig. 2b).\nAccordingly, 3 was used as the precatalyst for the meta-selective coupling\nbetween 2-phenylpyridine 8n and tert-butylbromide 18a at both 40 \u00b0C or under\nblue light irradiation, which in each case gave 19a in excellent yields and as\na single regioisomer. Reactivity of this class operating under mild heating\nrepresents a meaningful improvement compared with previous reports that have\ntypically required high temperatures (for example, 100\u2013120 \u00b0C). The meta-\nselective reactivity was further exemplified using (\u2212)-menthol-derivatized\n\u03b1-bromoester 18b which required 440 nm light to generate 19b in good yield.\nAlternative nitrogen-directing groups were similarly compatible. Specifically,\naryl-pyrazole 8h and aryl-oxazoline 8o underwent successful reaction with\ntert-butylbromide 18a at 50 \u00b0C to give the meta-alkylated products 19c and 19d\nin excellent and good yields, respectively. Use of Katritzky salt 20 further\ndemonstrated the capability of RuAqua 3 to serve as a generally applicable\nprecatalyst for meta-selective alkylation reactions^24. For example, reaction\nof 2-phenylpyridine 8n with 20 using 3 as a precatalyst gave meta-alkylated\narene 19e in good yield. Use of \u03b1-bromoamide 21 bearing a pendant acrylate\nallowed for the formation of \u03b3-lactam 19f following 5-exo intramolecular ring\nclosure and subsequent meta-C(sp^2)\u2013H coupling^25.\n\nGiven the demonstrated proficiency of RuAqua 3 in facilitating C(sp^2)\u2013H\nfunctionalization reactions, it was reasonable to hypothesize the presence of\nreactive aryl-ruthenium intermediates within the reaction mechanism. If this\nwere the case, the addition of deuterium sources could potentially result in\nthe incorporation of deuterium into the reacting substrate through reversible\nC(sp^2)\u2013H activation processes. To explore this possibility, we conducted a\nseries of hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments using d_2-D_2O (Fig. 2c).\nThese tests revealed substantial deuterium incorporation at the C(sp^2)\u2013H\nactivation site within the arene. Specifically, 2-phenylpyridine 8n underwent\nhydrogen/deuterium exchange primarily at the ortho sites with remarkable\nlevels of incorporation (95%). Similarly, 1-phenylpyrazole 8h, benzoic acid 22\nand 2-phenylbenzothiazole 8p underwent C(sp^2)\u2013H activation and\nhydrogen/deuterium exchange with varying degrees of success, ranging from\nmodest to excellent incorporations.\n\n### RuAqua as a general precatalyst and synthetic precursor\n\nThe comprehensive versatility exhibited by RuAqua 3 towards several reaction\nclasses within C(sp^2)\u2013H bond functionalization suggested the possibility of\nwider generality. We recognized that the availability of an air-stable high-\nutility precatalyst that could be applied in various synthetic transformations\nwould be broadly beneficial to the scientific community. Thus, we questioned\nthe expected capabilities of a generic ruthenium precatalyst (Fig. 3).\nReaction of eugenol 23 with parts per million quantities of 3 as a precatalyst\nallowed for efficient gramme-scale alkene isomerization to give\n\u03b2-methylstyrene derivative 24 in excellent yield and with high\ndiasteroselectivity (Fig. 3a). This reactivity compares favourably with that\nof previous precedent using organometallic ruthenium complexes (that is,\nRu(\u03b7^3-methylallyl)_2(1,5-cyclooctadiene, COD)) at elevated temperatures (150\n\u00b0C) and with the lower reactivity displayed by both RuCl_3 and 1 (ref. ^26).\nRuAqua 3 further demonstrated reactivity in the anti-Markovnikov\n1,2-hydroalkynylation of phenylacetylene 25 to give enyne 26 (Fig. 3b). Direct\ntertiary-C(sp^3)\u2013H bond oxidation of adamantane 27 was achieved using 3 as the\nprecatalyst with excess sodium periodate to give both adamantan-1-ol 28a and\nadamantan-1,3-diol 28b in good overall yield (Fig. 3c)^27. Moreover, the\nCurtius rearrangement of 29 containing the 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-one unit was\nfacilitated using 3 to give isocyanate 30 in excellent yield (Fig. 3d).\nAdditionally, RuAqua 3 proved effective for the oxidative cleavage of alkenes\nusing sodium periodate (Fig. 3e)^28. For example, stilbene 31a underwent\nefficient cleavage to give benzaldehyde 32a in good yield. Similarly,\nnorbornene 31b, triprolidine 31c, lumefantrine 31d and anethole 31e were all\napplicable to RuAqua 3 catalysed oxidative cleavage to give their respective\nketone and/or aldehyde products 32b\u201332e (and 32b\u2032\u201332e\u2032). The transfer\nhydrogenation of ketones could additionally be facilitated using 3 (Fig.\n3f)^29. Specifically, we targeted the reduction of simple ketones 33a\u201333d\nusing isopropanol as the terminal reductant which gave alcohols 34a\u201334d in\nmoderate to excellent yield. Moreover, the transfer hydrogenation showed\nreactivity when directly applied to the biologically active substrate\nfenofibrate 33e, which gave the corresponding alcohol 34e, albeit in low\nyield. Importantly, the reactivity demonstrated by RuAqua 3 was either\ncomparable or far superior to that of alternative ruthenium precatalysts for\nthis range of established catalytic transformations.\n\nFig. 3: Generic applicability of RuAqua 3 for several synthetic\ntransformations.\n\na, Ruthenium precatalyst 3 is effective for the alkene isomerization of\neugenol. b, Alkyne hydroalkynylation. c, C(sp^3)\u2013H bond oxidation using 3 as a\nprecatalyst. d, Curtius rearrangement of a 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-one group. e,\nAlkene cleavage using sodium periodate catalysed by 3.

Given the established lability of the monodentate ligands\nwithin RuAqua 3, we considered the ability of multidentate ligands to occupy\nthe coordination sphere of ruthenium by displacement of the ligand set within\n3. To probe this possibility, 3 was reacted with excess bipyridine using\nmechanochemical force in a solvent-free mixer mill (36 Hz, 1 h), which gave\nthe well-established photocatalyst [Ru(bpy)_3]^2+ 35 in excellent yield\n(80%)^30. This reactivity was extended to a range of analogous bipyridine and\nphenanthroline ligands to give a structurally differentiated set of\nphotocatalyst species 36\u201340 in excellent yields in all cases (77\u201387%).\nClassically, [Ru(bpy)_3]^2+ 35 and analogous derivatives, such as 36\u201340, have\ntypically been synthesized using RuCl_3 as a precursor, under reducing\nconditions and at high temperatures^31. Therefore, the ability to rapidly form\nthis family of high-reactivity complexes within a mixer mill provides a useful\nalternative that lowers the synthetic effort required to generate wide\nphotocatalyst libraries.\n\n### RuAqua as a generic precatalyst for accelerated discovery\n\nThe established applicability of RuAqua 3 for a diverse suite of synthetic\ntransformations is indicative of a broadly useful synthetic tool. In\nparticular, the generalizability exhibited by 3 offers potential applicability\nas a baseline precatalyst for the accelerated discovery of previously\nunreported reactions through high-throughput screening. To assess this\nconcept, we applied RuAqua 3 as a precatalyst in combination with both a\nreductant and a variety of potentially reducible compounds (Fig. 4). A varied\nsubstrate pool was selected as reaction targets, including carbonyls, alkenes,\nalkynes, nitriles, strained rings, imines, heterocycles and a nitro compound\n(Fig. 4a). Separately, each substrate was simultaneously reacted with both\nphenylsilane 41 and pinacolborane 42 using 3 as a precatalyst, in the absence\nof solvent and at room temperature (Fig. 4b)^32. After 24 h, the conversions\nfor each reaction were determined by ^1H NMR spectroscopy using an internal\nstandard. Using silane reductant 41, 20 reactions showed reactivity out of 30\ntotal reactions (67% hit rate, Fig. 4c, top). Similarly, 21 reactions showed\nreactivity using borane 42 (70% hit rate, Fig. 4c, bottom). In general, using\nboth silane 41 and borane 42, carbonyl compounds (A1\u2013A3, B4\u2013B7), alkenes\n(A4\u2013A6) and alkynes (A7\u2013A9) underwent hydrosilylation and hydroboration\n(Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). Nitriles (B1, B2) and nitro compound (C10)\nproved unreactive under reaction with silane 41. However, using borane 42\nallowed for partial reaction of a nitro compound (C10). Notably, several\nheterocycles (within C1\u2013C8) showed reactivity, highlighting the possibility of\nusing RuAqua 3 as a precatalyst for heterocycle hydrofunctionalization^33,34.\nIn fact, the reaction of quinoline (C2) with borane 42 resulted in clean\nheterocycle hydrogenation to give the corresponding tetrahydroquinoline 46 in\ngood yield (58% isolated), a transformation previously unknown with\nruthenium^35,36. Reaction results were validated by selection of specific\nexamples and performing replicate reactions with product isolations (Fig. 4d).\n\nFig. 4: Use of RuAqua 3 as a platform precatalyst for discovery.\n\na\u2013d, Discovery platform for reduction reactions using 3 as the precatalyst. a,\nSelection of unsaturated compounds explored. b, Reaction set-up: reactions\nwere conducted neat and at ambient temperature (19 \u00b0C) for 24 h. c, Results:\nconversion percentages of starting materials were determined by ^1H NMR\nspectroscopy using an internal standard. d, Reactions were validated for\nselect entries for both silane and borane reductants. e\u2013h, High-throughput\nexperimentation (HTE) photocatalyst selection by in situ formation of\nRu(bpy)_3^2+ analogues applied to the XAT radical 1,4-addition. e, Ligands\nexamined during screening. f, Reaction set-up: 3 premixed with L1\u2013L15 in\nCH_3CN/CH_2Cl_2 and irradiated for 1 h; 47, 48 and NEt_3 (2.0 equiv.) were\nthen added, and the mixture was further irradiated for 18 h. g, Results:\nreaction yields were determined by gas chromatography with flame ionization\ndetection using an internal standard. h, Photocatalyst 40 (from L13) was\nisolated and used directly in the reaction and compared to\n[Ru(bpy)_3](BF_4)_2.\n\nFull size image\n\nOne powerful tenet of modern high-throughput screening and optimization\nmethods is the modularity imparted by the choice of reactants, metal salts,\nligands and solvents^37. Conceptually, multifactorial reaction optimizations\nrely on the ability to use libraries of multiple components to\ncombinatorically survey broad reaction space to find optimally efficient\nreaction conditions^38. For synthetic catalysis, these strategies have\nbenefited from the ability of available precursors to undergo in situ\ncomplexation with added ligand libraries. This allows for the rapid assessment\nof many metal (pre)catalysts without the need for prior isolation and\nscreening of each individual complex. The lability of the monodentate ligand\nsphere within RuAqua 3 therefore presented an opportunity to test if this\nconcept could be applied within ruthenium catalysis. We specifically\nquestioned if the in situ formation of ruthenium photocatalyst species would\ndemonstrate this concept and allow for simultaneous screening of large ligand\nlibraries in the optimization of Dexter energy transfer or photoredox\ncatalysis without the need to separately synthesize each photocatalyst. This\nhypothesis was explored via the halogen-atom-transfer (XAT) radical Giese-type\naddition of isopropyl iodide 47 to methyl acrylate 48 (ref. ^39). A range of\nnitrogen-based ligands, including bipyridine derivatives (L1\u2013L9),\nphenanthroline derivatives (L10\u2013L14) and terpyridine L15, were precomplexed\nwith RuAqua 3 (Fig. 4e). This process was conducted for 1 h in either\nacetonitrile or dichloromethane under blue light irradiation, followed by the\naddition of reactants 47 and 48. The reactions were sampled at 4 h and 18 h to\ncreate a reactivity map for all ligands in both solvents (Fig. 4f). The\nresults indicated that bathophenanthroline (BPhen) ligand L13 performed\noptimally in acetonitrile and phenanthroline (Phen) ligand L10 in\ndichloromethane (Fig. 4g). Importantly, commonly used bipyridine (L1) led to\npoor reactivity in both solvents. To validate these findings, the isolated\nphotocatalyst species 35 and 40 were tested in acetonitrile under the same\nreaction conditions (Fig. 4h). These results affirmed our high-throughput\nscreen, with Ru(BPhen)_3^2+ 40 delivering a product yield of 85%, vastly\noutperforming Ru(bpy)_3^2+ 35, which gave only 22%. Taken together, these\nresults illustrate the generic applicability of RuAqua 3 as a platform\nprecatalyst for the discovery of synthetic inventions and for expedited\nmultifactorial optimizations.\n\nIn summary, we have outlined the design and synthesis of an air- and moisture-\nstable ruthenium precatalyst [(^tBuCN)_5Ru(H_2O)](BF_4)_2 (3). Notably,\nsynthetic access to decagramme quantities of 3 after two short and simple\nsynthetic steps highlights the potential for ease of manufacture and\nwidespread adoption. Application of 3 as a precatalyst demonstrated a\ngenerally applicable alternative to many predecessor complexes for several\ndifferent C(sp^2)\u2013H bond functionalization reactions. Namely, 3 proved\neffective for ortho-C(sp^2)\u2013H arylation, alkylation and methylation and for\nmeta-C(sp^2)\u2013H alkylation. Further capability for a range of diverse synthetic\ntransformations was highlighted by successful demonstration of alkene\nisomerization, hydroalkynylation, C(sp^3)\u2013H oxidation, Curtius rearrangement,\nalkene cleavage and transfer hydrogenation. Moreover, the suitability for 3 to\nbe used as a generic precatalyst for discovery was exemplified through\nsuccessful application to the reduction of several classes of reducible\ncompounds. Importantly, the labile ligand environment allowed for in situ\nformation of photocatalyst species, facilitating high-throughput screening and\naccelerating reaction optimization through catalyst selection. The broad\ngenerality and operational simplicity of RuAqua 3 provides a platform for the\ndiscovery and development of widely accessible ruthenium-catalysed synthetic\ntransformations.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Preparation of RuAqua 3\n\nThe reaction was set up in an argon-filled glovebox: RuCl_3\u00b7xH_2O (1.0 equiv.,\nassuming x = 3), zinc dust (<10 \u03bcm, 4.0 equiv.) and pivalonitrile were loaded\nin an Ace pressure tube which was subsequently wrapped in Teflon tape and\nparafilm. The sealed tube was taken out of the glovebox and heated for 2 h at\n115 \u00b0C behind a blast shield. The reaction mixture was cooled to room\ntemperature and the pivalonitrile removed under reduced pressure. The\nresulting mixture was diluted with HPLC-grade water before being filtered\nthrough a small plug of Celite to remove all solids. AgBF_4 (2.5 equiv.) was\nadded and the reaction was vigorously stirred for 1 h at room temperature\nbefore filtering through a small plug of Celite and evaporating to dryness.\nThe residue was dissolved in acetone, filtered through a small plug of Celite\nand evaporated to dryness. This was then dissolved in CH_2Cl_2, filtered\nthrough a small plug of Celite and evaporated to dryness. The residue was\ndissolved in CH_2Cl_2 and precipitated with Et_2O, affording a light-yellow\nsolid. The solid was collected, dissolved in CH_2Cl_2 and precipitated with\nEt_2O. The last precipitation step was reiterated until RuAqua was obtained as\na fine, light-yellow powder.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data supporting the findings of this work are provided in the\nSupplementary Information.
