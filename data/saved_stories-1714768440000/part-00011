And while you may get mocked for your image\nplacement and content:\n\nYou are generally free to show off your new ink whenever you want \u2014 the tattoo\nis yours after all! However, things get sticky when you think about tattoos\nfrom the artist\u2019s vantage point. Sure the tattoo is on your body, but don\u2019t\nthey have some IP rights in it as the artist? Jimmy Hayden thought so, and\nwhile he lost his copyright case, there\u2019s still some colorable ambiguity about\nhow future cases will pan out. From Bloomberg:\n\nSponsored\n\n### Is The Future Of Law Distributed?

The verdict marked the third time since 2020 a\n> judge or jury declined to endorse a tattooist\u2019s claimed cut of a 2K video\n> game\u2019s profits when a real-life person depicted in the game flashed their\n> designs.\n>\n> Illinois tattoo artist Catherine Alexander fared better in 2022 when a jury\n> found \u201cWWE 2K\u201d infringed her copyrights in tattoos on pro wrestler Randy\n> Orton. But even in that case, the jury awarded Alexander just $3,750, a\n> fraction of what she sought.\n\nIts not clear what tattoo artists looking for an unexpected windfall hell bent\non protecting their copyright should do to prevent situations like this in the\nfuture. Treat the rendering and proliferation of their art as free publicity\nand call it even? Hit their clients with stronger contactual language\nrequiring them to consult the artist before each picture, video or recording\nof their likeness? No way that option would do well for their bottom line.\n\nArtists may be able to lobby together and put pressure on the ability of\ngaming companies to render player\u2019s tattoos without consulting artists, but\nthat would be a very hard hill to climb. Trust, there would be a lot of\ncomplaints if EA or 2K were forced to switch over from hyper-realistic\nrenditions of basketball players to Mii Avatars dunking:\n\n### Sponsored\n\nSponsored\n\n### The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm\n\nChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI \u2013 even for law firms.\n\nFrom THOMSON REUTERS\n\nSponsored\n\n### Is The Future Of Law Distributed?
