This information relates to a prerelease\nproduct that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft\nmakes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information\nprovided here.\n\nThis article describes some of the newest developments in Windows Server 2025,\nwhich boasts advanced features that improve security, performance, and\nflexibility. With faster storage options and the ability to integrate with\nhybrid cloud environments, managing your infrastructure is now more\nstreamlined. Windows Server 2025 builds on the strong foundation of its\npredecessor while introducing a range of innovative enhancements to adapt to\nyour needs.\n\nIf you're interested in trying out the latest features of Windows Server 2025\nbefore official release, see Get started with Windows Server Insiders Preview.\n\n## What's new\n\nThe following new features are specific to Windows Server with Desktop\nExperience only. Having both the physical devices running the operating system\nand the correct drivers readily available are required.\n\n### Active Directory Domain Services\n\nThe latest enhancements to Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Active\nDirectory Lightweight Domain Services (AD LDS) introduce a range of new\nfunctionalities and capabilities aimed at optimizing your domain management\nexperience:\n\n  * 32k database page size optional feature - AD uses an Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) database since its introduction in Windows 2000 that uses an 8k database page size. The 8k architectural design decision resulted in limitations throughout AD that are documented in AD Maximum Limits Scalability. An example of this limitation is a single record AD object, which can't exceed 8k bytes in size. Moving to a 32k database page format offers a huge improvement in areas affected by legacy restrictions, including multi-valued attributes are now able to hold up to ~3,200 values, which is an increase by a factor of 2.6.\n\nNew DCs can be installed with a 32k page database that uses 64-bit Long Value\nIDs (LIDs) and runs in an \"8k page mode\" for compatibility with previous\nversions. An upgraded DC continues to use its current database format and 8k\npages. Moving to 32k database pages is done on a forest-wide basis and\nrequires that all DCs in the forest have a 32k page capable database.\n\n  * AD schema updates - Three new Log Database Files (LDF) are introduced that extend the AD schema, sch89.ldf, sch90.ldf, and sch91.ldf. The AD LDS equivalent schema updates are in MS-ADAM-Upgrade3.ldf. For learn more about previous schema updates, see Windows Server AD schema updates\n\n  * AD object repair - AD now allows enterprise administrators to repair objects with missing core attributes SamAccountType and ObjectCategory. Enterprise administrators can reset the LastLogonTimeStamp attribute on an object to the current time. These operations are achieved through a new RootDSE modify operation feature on the affected object called fixupObjectState.\n\n  * Channel binding audit support - Events 3074 and 3075 can now be enabled for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) channel binding. When the channel binding policy was modified to a more secure setting, an administrator can identify devices in the environment that don't support or fail channel binding validations. These audit events are also available in Windows Server 2022 and later via KB4520412.\n\n  * DC-location algorithm improvements - DC discovery algorithm provides new functionality with improvements to mapping of short NetBIOS-style domain names to DNS-style domain names. To learn more, see Active Directory DC locator changes.\n\nNote\n\nWindows doesn't use mailslots during DC discovery operations as Microsoft has\nannounced the deprecation of WINS and mailslots for these legacy technologies.\n\n  * Forest and Domain Functional Levels - The new functional level is used for general supportability and is required for the new 32K database page size feature. The new functional level maps to the value of DomainLevel 10 and ForestLevel 10 for unattended installs. Microsoft has no plans to retrofit functional levels for Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022. To perform an unattended promotion and demotion of a Domain Controller (DC), see DCPROMO answer file syntax for unattended promotion and demotion of domain controllers.\n\nThe DsGetDcName Application Programming Interface (API) also supports a new\nflag DS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE_13_REQUIRED that enables location of DCs running\nWindows Server 2025. You can learn more about functional levels in the\nfollowing articles:\n\n    * Forest and Domain Functional Levels\n\n    * Raise the Domain Functional Level\n\n    * Raise the Forest Functional Level\n\nNote\n\nNew AD forests or AD LDS configuration sets are required to have a functional\nlevel of Windows Server 2016 or greater. Promotion of an AD or AD LDS replica\nrequires that the existing domain or config set is already running with a\nfunctional level of Windows Server 2016 or greater.\n\nMicrosoft recommends that all customers begin planning now to upgrade their AD\nand AD LDS servers to Windows Server 2022 in preparation of the next release.\n\n  * Improved algorithms for Name/Sid Lookups - Local Security Authority (LSA) Name and Sid lookup forwarding between machine accounts no longer uses the legacy Netlogon secure channel. Kerberos authentication and DC Locator algorithm are used instead. To maintain compatibility with legacy operating systems, it's still possible to use the Netlogon secure channel as a fallback option.\n\n  * Improved security for confidential attributes - DCs and AD LDS instances only allow LDAP add, search, and modify operations involving confidential attributes when the connection is encrypted.\n\n  * Improved security for default machine account passwords - AD now uses random generated default computer account passwords. Windows 2025 DCs block setting computer account passwords to the default password of the computer account name.\n\nThis behavior can be controlled by enabling the GPO setting Domain controller:\nRefuse setting default machine account password located in: Computer\nConfiguration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security\nOptions\n\nUtilities like Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC), Active Directory\nUsers and Computers (ADUC), net computer, and dsmod also honors this new\nbehavior. Both ADAC and ADUC no longer allow creating a pre-2k Windows\naccount.\n\n  * Kerberos AES SHA256 and SHA384 - The Kerberos protocol implementation is updated to support stronger encryption and signing mechanisms with support for RFC 8009 by adding SHA-256 and SHA-384. RC4 is deprecated and moved to the do-not-use cipher list.\n\n  * Kerberos PKINIT support for cryptographic agility - The Kerberos Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT) protocol implementation is updated to allow for cryptographic agility by supporting more algorithms and removing hardcoded algorithms.\n\n  * LAN Manager GPO setting - The GPO setting Network security: Don't store LAN Manager hash value on next password change is no longer present nor applicable to new versions of Windows.\n\n  * LDAP encryption by default - All LDAP client communication after a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) bind utilizes LDAP sealing by default. To learn more about SASL, see SASL Authentication.\n\n  * LDAP support for TLS 1.3 - LDAP uses the latest SCHANNEL implementation and supports TLS 1.3 for LDAP over TLS connections. Using TLS 1.3 eliminates obsolete cryptographic algorithms, enhances security over older versions, and aims to encrypt as much of the handshake as possible. To learn more, see Protocols in TLS/SSL (Schannel SSP) and TLS Cipher Suites in Windows Server 2022.\n\n  * Legacy SAM RPC password change behavior - Secure protocols such as Kerberos are the preferred way to change domain user passwords. On DCs, the latest SAM RPC password change method SamrUnicodeChangePasswordUser4 using AES is accepted by default when called remotely. The following legacy SAM RPC methods are blocked by default when called remotely:\n\n    * SamrChangePasswordUser\n\n    * SamrOemChangePasswordUser2\n\n    * SamrUnicodeChangePasswordUser2\n\nFor domain users that are members of the Protected Users group and for local\naccounts on domain member computers, all remote password changes through the\nlegacy SAM RPC interface are blocked by default including\nSamrUnicodeChangePasswordUser4.\n\nThis behavior can be controlled using the following Group Policy Object (GPO)\nsetting:\n\nComputer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Security Account\nManager > Configure SAM change password RPC methods policy\n\n  * NUMA support - AD DS now takes advantage of Non-uniform Memory Access (NUMA) capable hardware by utilizing CPUs in all processor groups. Previously, AD would only use CPUs in group 0. Active Directory can expand beyond 64 cores.\n\n  * Performance counters - Monitoring and troubleshooting the performance of the following counters are now available:\n\n    * DC Locator - Client and DC specific counters available.\n\n    * LSA Lookups - Name and SID lookups through the LsaLookupNames, LsaLookupSids, and equivalent APIs. These counters are available on both Client and Server SKUs.\n\n    * LDAP Client - Available in Windows Server 2022 and later via KB 5029250 update.\n\n  * Replication priority order - AD now allows administrators to increase the system calculated replication priority with a particular replication partner for a particular naming context. This feature allows more flexibility in configuring the replication order to address specific scenarios.\n\n### Azure Arc\n\nBy default, the Azure Arc setup Feature-on-Demand is installed, which offers a\nuser-friendly wizard interface and a system tray icon in the taskbar to\nfacilitate the process of adding servers to Azure Arc. Azure Arc extends the\ncapabilities of the Azure platform, allowing for the creation of applications\nand services that can operate in diverse environments. These include data\ncenters, the edge, multicloud environments, and provide increased flexibility.\nTo learn more, see Connect Windows Server machines to Azure through Azure Arc\nSetup.\n\n### Bluetooth\n\nYou can now connect mice, keyboards, headsets, audio devices, and more via\nbluetooth in Windows Server 2025.\n\n### Desktop shell\n\nWhen you sign in for the first time, the desktop shell experience conforms to\nthe style and appearance of Windows 11.\n\n### Delegated Managed Service Account\n\nThis new type of account enables migration from a service account to a\ndelegated Managed Service Account (dMSA). This account type comes with managed\nand fully randomized keys ensuring minimal application changes while disabling\nthe original service account passwords. To learn more, see Delegated Managed\nService Accounts overview.\n\n### DTrace\n\nWindows Server 2025 comes equipped with dtrace as a native tool. DTrace is a\ncommand-line utility that enables users to monitor and troubleshoot their\nsystem's performance in real-time. DTrace allows users to dynamically\ninstrument both the kernel and user-space code without any need to modify the\ncode itself. This versatile tool supports a range of data collection and\nanalysis techniques, such as aggregations, histograms, and tracing of user-\nlevel events. To learn more, see DTrace for command line help and DTrace on\nWindows for additional capabilities.\n\n### Email & accounts\n\nYou can now add the following accounts in Settings > Accounts > Email &\naccounts for Windows Server 2025:\n\n  * Microsoft Entra ID\n  * Microsoft account\n  * Work or school account\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that domain join is still required for most\nsituations.\n\n### Feedback Hub\n\nSubmitting feedback or reporting problems encountered while using Windows\nServer 2025 can now be done using the Windows Feedback Hub. You can include\nscreenshots or recordings of the process that caused the issue to help us\nunderstand your situation and share suggestions to enhance your Windows\nexperience. To learn more, see Explore the Feedback Hub.\n\n### File Compression\n\nBuild 26040 has a new compression feature when compressing an item by\nperforming a right-click called Compress to. This feature supports ZIP, 7z,\nand TAR compression formats with specific compression methods for each.\n\n### Flighting\n\nFlighting is only available for the Canary Channel release beginning in early\n2024 starting with build 26010, which allows users to receive Windows Server\nflights similar to Windows client. To enable flighting on your device, go to\nStart > Settings > Windows Update > Windows Insider Program. From there, you\ncan choose to opt into your desired Insiders release.\n\n### Pinned apps\n\nPinning your most used apps is now available through the Start menu and is\ncustomizable to suit your needs. As of build 26085, the default pinned apps\nare currently:\n\n  * Azure Arc Setup\n  * Feedback Hub\n  * File Explorer\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Server Manager\n  * Settings\n  * Terminal\n  * Windows PowerShell\n\n### Server Message Block\n\nServer Message Block (SMB) is one of the most widely used protocols in\nnetworking by providing a reliable way to share files and other resources\nbetween devices on your network. Windows Server 2025 brings the following SMB\ncapabilities.\n\nStarting with build 26090, another set of SMB protocol changes are introduced\nfor disabling QUIC, signing, and encryption.\n\n  * SMB over QUIC disablement\n\nAdministrators can disable SMB over QUIC client through Group Policy and\nPowerShell. To disable SMB over QUIC using Group Policy, set the Enable SMB\nover QUIC policy in these paths to Disabled.\n\n    * Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Network\\Lanman Workstation\n\n    * Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Network\\Lanman Server\n\nTo disable SMB over QUIC using PowerShell, run this command in an elevated\nPowerShell prompt:\n\n    \n        Set-SmbClientConfiguration -EnableSMBQUIC $false\n\n  * SMB signing and encryption auditing\n\nAdministrators can enable auditing of the SMB server and client for support of\nSMB signing and encryption. If a third-party client or server lacks support\nfor SMB encryption or signing, it can be detected. When your third-party\ndevice or software states it supports SMB 3.1.1, but fails to support SMB\nsigning, it violates the SMB 3.1.1 Pre-authentication integrity protocol\nrequirement.\n\nYou can configure SMB signing and encryption auditing settings using Group\nPolicy or PowerShell. These policies can be changed in the following Group\nPolicy paths:\n\n    * Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Network\\Lanman Server\\Audit client does not support encryption\n\n    * Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Network\\Lanman Server\\Audit client does not support signing\n\n    * Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Network\\Lanman Workstation\\Audit server does not support encryption\n\n    * Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Network\\Lanman Workstation\\Audit server does not support signing\n\nTo perform these changes using PowerShell, run these commands in an elevated\nprompt where $true is to enable and $false to disable these settings:\n\n    \n        Set-SmbServerConfiguration -AuditClientDoesNotSupportEncryption $true Set-SmbServerConfiguration -AuditClientDoesNotSupportSigning $true Set-SmbClientConfiguration -AuditServerDoesNotSupportEncryption $true Set-SmbClientConfiguration -AuditServerDoesNotSupportSigning $true\n\nEvent logs for these changes are stored in the following Event Viewer paths\nwith their given Event ID.\n\nPath| Event ID  \n---|---  \nApplications and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SMBClient\\Audit| 31998 31999  \nApplications and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SMBServer\\Audit| 3021 3022  \n  \n  * SMB over QUIC auditing\n\nSMB over QUIC client connection auditing captures events that are written to\nan event log to include the QUIC transport in the Event Viewer. These logs are\nstored in the following paths with their given Event ID.\n\nPath| Event ID  \n---|---  \nApplications and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SMBClient\\Connectivity| 30832  \nApplications and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SMBServer\\Connectivity| 1913  \n  \n  * The SMB over QUIC server feature, which was only available in Windows Server Azure Edition, is now available in both Windows Server Standard and Windows Server Datacenter versions. SMB over QUIC adds the benefits of the QUIC, which provides low-latency, encrypted connections over the internet.\n\nPreviously, SMB server in Windows mandated inbound connections to use the\nIANA-registered port TCP/445 while the SMB TCP client only allowed outbound\nconnections to that same TCP port. Now, SMB over QUIC allows for SMB\nalternative ports where QUIC-mandated UDP/443 ports are available for both\nserver and client devices. To learn more, see Configure alternative SMB ports.\n\nAnother feature that's introduced to SMB over QUIC is client access control,\nwhich is an alternative to TCP and RDMA that supplies secure connectivity to\nedge file servers over untrusted networks. To learn more, see How client\naccess control works.\n\n  * Previously, when a share was created, the SMB firewall rules would be automatically configured to enable the \"File and Printer Sharing\" group for the relevant firewall profiles. Now, the creation of an SMB share in Windows results in the automatic configuration of the new \"File and Printer Sharing (Restrictive)\" group, which no longer permits inbound NetBIOS ports 137-139. To learn more, see Updated firewall rules.\n\n  * Starting with build 25997, an update is made to enforce SMB encryption for all outbound SMB client connections. With this update, administrators can set a mandate that all destination servers support SMB 3.x and encryption. If a server lacks these capabilities, the client is unable to establish a connection.\n\n  * Also in build 25997, the SMB authentication rate limiter, which limits the number of authentication attempts that can be made within a certain time period, is enabled by default. To learn more, see How SMB authentication rate limiter works\n\n  * Starting with build 25951, the SMB client supports NTLM blocking for remote outbound connections. Previously, the Windows Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) would negotiate Kerberos, NTLM, and other mechanisms with the destination server to determine a supported security package. To learn more, see Block NTLM connections on SMB\n\n  * A new feature in build 25951 allows you to manage SMB dialects in Windows where the SMB server now controls which SMB 2 and SMB 3 dialects it negotiates compared to the previous behavior matching only the highest dialect.\n\n  * Beginning with build 25931, SMB signing is now required by default for all SMB outbound connections where previously it was only required when connecting to shares named SYSVOL and NETLOGON on AD domain controllers. To learn more, see How signing works.\n\n  * The Remote Mailslot protocol is disabled by default starting in build 25314 and may be removed in a later release. To learn more, see Features we're no longer developing.\n\n  * SMB compression adds support for industry standard LZ4 compression algorithm, in addition to its existing support for XPRESS (LZ77), XPRESS Huffman (LZ77+Huffman), LZNT1, and PATTERN_V1.\n\n### Storage Replica Enhanced Log\n\nEnhanced Logs help the Storage Replica log implementation to eliminate the\nperformance costs associated with file system abstractions, leading to\nimproved block replication performance. To learn more, see Storage Replica\nEnhanced Log.\n\n### Task Manager\n\nBuild 26040 now sports the modern Task Manager app with mica material\nconforming to the style of Windows 11.\n\n### Wi-Fi\n\nIt's now easier to enable wireless capabilities as the Wireless LAN Service\nfeature is now installed by default. The wireless startup service is set to\nmanual and can be enabled by running net start wlansvc in the Command Prompt,\nWindows Terminal, or PowerShell.\n\n### Windows containers portability\n\nPortability is a crucial aspect of container management and has the ability to\nsimplify upgrades by applying enhanced flexibility and compatibility of\ncontainers in Windows. Portability is a feature of Windows Server Annual\nChannel for container hosts that allows users to move container images, and\ntheir associated data, between different hosts or environments without\nrequiring any modifications. Users can create a container image on one host\nand then deploy it on another host without having to worry about compatibility\nissues. To learn more, see Portability for containers.\n\n### Windows Insider Program\n\nThe Windows Insider Program provides early access to the latest Windows OS\nreleases for a community of enthusiasts. As a member, you can be among the\nfirst to try out new ideas and concepts that Microsoft is developing. After\nregistering as a member, you can opt to participate in different release\nchannels by going to go to Start > Settings > Windows Update > Windows Insider\nProgram.\n\n### Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)\n\nWindows LAPS helps organizations manage local administrator passwords on their\ndomain-joined computers. It automatically generates unique passwords for each\ncomputer's local administrator account, stores them securely in AD, and\nupdates them regularly. This helps to improve security by reducing the risk of\nattackers gaining access to sensitive systems using compromised or easily\nguessable passwords.\n\nSeveral features are introduced to Microsoft LAPS that bring the following\nimprovements:\n\n  * New automatic account management feature\n\nThe latest update allows IT admins to create a managed local account with\nease. With this feature, you can customize the account name, enable or disable\nthe account, and even randomize the account name for enhanced security.\nAdditionally, the update includes improved integration with Microsoft's\nexisting local account management policies. To learn more about this feature,\nsee Windows LAPS account management modes.\n\n  * New image rollback detection feature\n\nWindows LAPS now detects when an image rollback occurs. If a rollback does\nhappen, the password stored in AD may no longer match the password stored\nlocally on the device. Rollbacks can result in a \"torn state\" where the IT\nadmin is unable to sign into the device using the persisted Windows LAPS\npassword.\n\nTo address this issue, a new feature was added that includes an AD attribute\ncalled msLAPS-CurrentPasswordVersion. This attribute contains a random GUID\nwritten by Windows LAPS every time a new password is persisted in AD and saved\nlocally. During every processing cycle, the GUID stored in msLAPS-\nCurrentPasswordVersion is queried and compared to the locally persisted copy.\nIf they're different, the password is immediately rotated.\n\nTo enable this feature, it's necessary to run the latest version of the\nUpdate-LapsADSchema cmdlet. Once complete, Windows LAPS recognizes the new\nattribute and begins using it. If you don't run the updated version of the\nUpdate-LapsADSchema cmdlet, Windows LAPS logs a 10108 warning event in the\nevent log, but continues to function normally in all other respects.\n\nNo policy settings are used to enable or configure this feature. The feature\nis always enabled once the new schema attribute is added.\n\n  * New passphrase feature\n\nIT admins can now utilize a new feature in Windows LAPS that enables the\ngeneration of less complex passphrases. An example would be a passphrase such\nas \"EatYummyCaramelCandy\", which is easier to read, remember, and type,\ncompared to a traditional password like \"V3r_b4tim#963?\".\n\nThis new feature also allows the PasswordComplexity policy setting to be\nconfigured to select one of three different passphrase word lists, all of\nwhich are included in Windows without requiring a separate download. A new\npolicy setting called PassphraseLength controls the number of words used in\nthe passphrase.\n\nWhen you're creating a passphrase, the specified number of words are randomly\nselected from the chosen word list and concatenated. The first letter of each\nword is capitalized to enhance readability. This feature also fully supports\nbacking passwords up to either Windows Server AD or Microsoft Entra ID.\n\nThe passphrase word lists used in the three new PasswordComplexity passphrase\nsettings are sourced from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's article, \"Deep\nDive: EFF's New Wordlists for Random Passphrases\". The Windows LAPS Passphrase\nWord Lists is licensed under the CC-BY-3.0 Attribution license and is\navailable for download.\n\nNote\n\nWindows LAPS doesn't allow for customization of the built-in word lists nor\nthe use of customer-configured word lists.\n\n  * Improved readability password dictionary\n\nWindows LAPS introduces a new PasswordComplexity setting that enables IT\nadmins to create less complex passwords. This feature allows you to customize\nLAPS to use all four character categories (upper case letters, lower case\nletters, numbers, and special characters) like the existing complexity setting\nof 4. However, with the new setting of 5, the more complex characters are\nexcluded to enhance password readability and minimize confusion. For example,\nthe number \"1\" and the letter \"I\" are never used with the new setting.\n\nWhen PasswordComplexity is configured to 5, the following changes are made to\nthe default password dictionary character set:\n\n    1. Don\u2019t use these letters: 'I', 'O', 'Q', 'l', 'o'\n    2. Don\u2019t use these numbers: '0', '1'\n    3. Don\u2019t use these \"special\" characters: ',', '.', '&', '{', '}', '[', ']', '(', ')', ';'\n    4. Start using these \"special\" characters: ':', '=', '?', '*'\n\nThe Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in (via Microsoft Management\nConsole) now features an improved Windows LAPS tab. The Windows LAPS password\nis now displayed in a new font that enhances its readability when shown in\nplain text.\n\n  * PostAuthenticationAction support for terminating individual processes\n\nA new option is added to the PostAuthenticationActions (PAA) Group Policy\nsetting, \u201cReset the password, sign out the managed account, and terminate any\nremaining processes\u201d located in Computer Configuration > Administrative\nTemplates > System > LAPS > Post-authentication actions.\n\nThis new option is an extension of the previous \"Reset the password and sign\nout the managed account\" option. Once configured, the PAA notifies and then\nterminates any interactive sign-in sessions. It enumerates and terminates any\nremaining processes that are still running under the Windows LAPS-managed\nlocal account identity. It's important to note that no notification precedes\nthis termination.\n\nFurthermore, the expansion of logging events during post-authentication-action\nexecution provides deeper insights into the operation.\n\nTo learn more about Windows LAPS, see What is Windows LAPS?.\n\n### Windows Terminal\n\nThe Windows Terminal, a powerful and efficient multishell application for\ncommand-line users, is available in this build. Search for \"Terminal\" in the\nsearch bar.\n\n### Winget\n\nWinget is installed by default, which is a command line Windows Package\nManager tool that provides comprehensive package manager solutions for\ninstalling applications on Windows devices. To learn more, see Use the winget\ntool to install and manage applications.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Windows Server Insiders Community discussions\n\n## Feedback\n\nComing soon: Throughout 2024 we will be phasing out GitHub Issues as the\nfeedback mechanism for content and replacing it with a new feedback system.\nFor more information see: https://aka.ms/ContentUserFeedback.\n\nSubmit and view feedback for\n\nThis product This page\n\nView all page feedback\n\n## Additional resources\n\nEnglish (United States)\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n  * Previous Versions\n  * Blog\n  * Contribute\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Trademarks\n  * \u00a9 Microsoft 2024\n\n## Additional resources\n\nEnglish (United States)\n\nYour Privacy Choices\n\n  * Previous Versions\n  * Blog\n  * Contribute\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Trademarks\n  * \u00a9 Microsoft 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
