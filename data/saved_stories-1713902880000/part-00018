We leverage recent advancements in\n> large language models (LLMs) and present a visual language model (VLM) that\n> can fulfill diverse tasks on mobile devices. Our model functions by\n> interacting solely with the user interface (UI). It uses the visual input\n> from the device screen and mimics human-like interactions, encompassing\n> gestures such as tapping and swiping. This generality in the input and\n> output space allows our agent to interact with any application on the\n> device. Unlike previous methods, our model operates not only on a single\n> screen image but on vision-language sentences created from sequences of past\n> screenshots along with corresponding actions. Evaluating our method on the\n> challenging Android in the Wild benchmark demonstrates its promising\n> efficacy and potential.\n\nComments:| ICLR 2024 workshop on Generative Models for Decision Making  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer\nVision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.08755 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.08755v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.08755arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Nicolai Dorka [view email] [v1] Fri, 12 Apr 2024 18:28:44 UTC (1,752 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Training a Vision Language Model as Smartphone\nAssistant, by Nicolai Dorka and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CV cs.HC\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
