Essays will remain free to read.\n\nSaint Sebastian by Sandro Botticelli is the first superlative nude in the\nhistory of Western painting.1 No male figure in art could be said to be more\nbeautiful than Botticelli\u2019s saint. His beauty is haunting\u2014which is to say, he\nis more than beautiful. An artwork may be supremely beautiful and utterly\nforgettable. What is it about this painting that is haunting?\n\nIt was hung on January 10, the saint\u2019s feast day, 1474, inside the church of\nSanta Maria Maggiore in Florence, a short walk from the neighbourhood where\nBotticelli was born, died, was buried, and, not counting his year in Rome\npainting the walls of the Sistine Chapel, lived his entire life. Its subject\nwas immensely popular in art throughout Europe at the time. Legend held that\nSebastian, a praetorian guard in the Roman army, was sentenced by Diocletian\nto death by arrow-fire for his faith and conversion of soldiers and prisoners\nunder his watch. The saint\u2019s cult arose in the fourth century; he would come\nto be worshipped as a protector against the plague. By the time of\nBotticelli\u2019s commission, veneration of the saint was at its peak. Thousands of\nSebastians would be painted for churches and chapels over the next two\ncenturies.\n\nA hundred years earlier, a new altarpiece at Florence Cathedral depicted the\nsaint surrounded by archers, his body\u2014wretchedly, though hardly\nrealistically\u2014pierced all over with arrows. Artists by this time were\nportraying Sebastian nude and at the scene of his martyrdom, but the\nimpersonality of the medieval saint lingers into the fourteenth century.2 In\nthe Early Renaissance, Botticelli\u2019s elders typically represent Sebastian\naccepting his persecution willfully, or passively. He gazes attentively up at\nthe Lord in the large left panel of Piero\u2019s Misericordia polyptych; in a\nfresco by Gozzoli\u2014painted, though only nine years before Botticelli\u2019s work, in\nan altogether late-Gothic style\u2014he appears unbothered, as in a Crivelli\naltarpiece; appropriate to his figurine-like body is his stunned and distant\nexpression in a triptych by the Bellinis.\n\nOf course Sebastians of the Renaissance are classically beautiful: the god\nApollo, after a long millennium, returned. The saint\u2019s physique and face now\ntake on differing characters. Typically he looks heavenward, whether in\ncontemplation (Perugino), wistfulness (Antonello), or longing (Leonardo); in\nsuffering (Mantegna\u2019s Vienna and Louvre Sebastians) or dreadful supplication\n(Signorelli, Pollaiuolo brothers, Il Sodoma). Otherwise he looks off\nelsewhere3\u2014his bearing one of terrible sadness, in Foppa; of heroic struggle,\nin Titian; of resignation, in Durer; but also, conversely, of innocent and\nelegant indifference in paintings by Cima.4 During the Counter-Reformation,\nworshippers become newly intimate with Sebastian, who suffers now in a state\nof ecstasy. He is defiant in a late Titian, wholly transcendent in a Tanzio.\nThe fact of his being tied up becomes the pretext for sensational displays of\nthe male body in works by El Greco, Rubens, and Reni.5\n\nBotticelli\u2019s saint has a quality none of these paintings share. Compared with\nthe one-man melodramas of the Baroque, his Sebastian should appear sedate.\nInstead, after those he strikes us only more intensely. Comparison with other\npaintings shows mainly what he is not. What is that unforgettable quality in\nhim? The question we should be asking is, What hand did the Muse have in Saint\nSebastian? Botticelli\u2019s drawing made in preparation for the painting reveals\nit. Looking between the artist\u2019s draft and his completed work, we see exactly\nhow the Muse guided Sandro Botticelli.\n\nLeft: Study for a Standing Man (Saint Sebastian) (c. 1473)\n\nThe study is on a sheet roughly 20 centimetres long, a tenth the size of the\ntwo-metre-tall painting. Different attributions for the drawing were proposed\nin the twentieth century; it was long thought to have been copied from Saint\nSebastian and was recognized only recently as a preparatory study by the\nartist.6 To render the figure\u2019s anatomy, Botticelli has used two materials and\ntechniques: metalpoint, for outlining the body\u2019s contours, and white-gouache\nshading, for its muscular definition. Light strikes from the left,\naccentuating the torso\u2019s vertical plane. You could mistake it for a drawing\nafter a lost Greek bronze.\n\nSaint Sebastian has a sculptural character owing to this same gorgeous\ninterplay of lighting and physique. What the painting does not share with the\ndrawing is the charge of the earlier figure\u2019s pose. From the hips down, their\nforms are similar. Above the hips, the drawn figure\u2014unlike the painted\u2014is\nstraining, possibly in pain. His wrists are held higher against his back, with\nradiating effects: The arms bend more, the back arches, the chest juts out,\nthe muscles tense, the shoulders slant at an angle, and the whole body adopts\na pronounced contrapposto. Absent any details showing the figure as bound and\nwounded, the pose is almost exhibitionistic.\n\nHere is where the Muse intervened.\n\nEverything about Botticelli\u2019s Sebastian depends on his stance not being one of\nphysical tension. Unlike almost every Saint Sebastian of the Renaissance and\nBaroque, he looks out at us directly. There is no shame in his face\u2014nor is\nthere humility, provocation, yearning, or pride. Imagine, now, that cocked\nhead on the posturing body of the drawing. His whole demeanor would shift: The\nheavy-lidded eyes and prominent jaw would appear conceited. That unreadable\nface we know, the face we cannot forget, would be suddenly legible: an\naudacious, proud face. Had the artist painted the saint\u2019s upper body as he\nsketched it, Sebastian would be another man entirely. He would be posing\nbefore an audience. Like all posers, a desire for the viewer\u2019s attention and\napproval would animate him.\n\nThe haunting figure of the painting does not perform for an imagined audience.\nIt would never occur to Sebastian to wonder what we think of him. The Muse\nunderstood this\u2014and under her direction, the artist diverged from the\nstraining pose of his earlier study. For his gaze to hold us as it does,\nSebastian could not be posturing. Only the noble body in repose could have\nbeen married to that face.7\n\nOn account of his classical beauty, Saint Sebastian has been called the first\nheir to Donatello\u2019s bronze David, sculpted some thirty or forty years\nearlier.8 I believe the nudes are equals less because they share some uncommon\nmeasure of beauty, and both manifest a reverence for the human form not seen\nsince antiquity, but more fundamentally because each is one of those\ninexplicable beings, in art as in life, that is the total embodiment of an\nattitude.\n\nBotticelli\u2019s Sebastian is the embodiment of self-possession. Every element of\nhim communicates this. He has to look us in the eye. His expression, the Muse\nknew, must be permitted to convey nothing but that quiet, passionate\nconfidence. He is not some Stoic who overcomes his suffering through\ncalculated reason, and is not distractedly indifferent like the saints of\nPiero and Cima and Perugino. Rather, he is the supreme individual who takes no\nspecial interest in the self, or the self\u2019s suffering. No other figure in art\nis more at odds with our traumatized time. Sebastian\u2019s unforgettable attitude,\ntransmitted to us through his face and comportment, is of complete self-\npossession, as like a god.\n\nThis is the first installment of a two-part essay. \u201cMuse among the Drafts:\nPart II,\u201d on Matisse, T. S. Eliot, and others, will post two weeks from today.\n\nI\u2019m turning on paid subscriptions should any of you wish to support my work\nmonetarily. Who knows when the hell I\u2019ll have a book. All essays on here will\nremain free to read.\n\n1\n\nGiven that the written record tells how panel painting was the most highly\nregarded of all artforms in ancient Greece, doubtless artists of the time\nproduced two-dimensional paintings of the human form as majestic as the nude\nsculptures, almost exclusively in marble, that have come down to us either in\nthe original or in Roman copies. Thanks to the twin destructive forces of\nnature and the human character\u2014from fires and floods; gravity and erosion;\niconoclasm and ignorance; greed, war, and the bleaching sun\u2014panel paintings,\ncategorically, have not survived. The very few remaining frescoes cannot be\nconsidered representative of ancient Greek panel painting; Athenian red-figure\nvases, glorious though they are, are less relevant still. We can only\nspeculate, dreamily, as to the aesthetic greatness those painters, like the\nsculptors of bronzes, achieved between the fifth and second centuries BC.\n\n2\n\nIn frescoes and mosaics from the Early Middle Ages, the earliest known\ndepictions of Sebastian, he is indistinguishable from other male figures but\nfor labels identifying him. For hundreds of years he appears in church\ndecorations clothed and bearded\u2014not unlike the biblical figure David, who\nwould be immortalized by Donatello and Michelangelo as a naked youth, though\nmedieval artworks by convention show him as a king in robes and crown. Later\nin the medieval period, the circumstance of Sebastian\u2019s martyrdom starts being\nalluded to in his imagery, in the form of arrows that he holds. Artists by the\nfourteenth century almost exclusively depict him at the scene of his\npersecution. For more history, see Irving L. Zupnick\u2019s Saint Sebastian in Art\nand Sheila Barker\u2019s \u201cThe Making of a Plague Saint.\u201d\n\n3\n\nIn a handful of paintings besides Botticelli\u2019s, the saint looks straight out\nat the viewer. These works are almost entirely within the Northern European\ntradition: the Sebastians of Memling, rigid and expressionless; Baldung,\nstrangely animated; and Holbein the Elder, sorrowful and meek.\n\n4\n\nCima\u2019s works are notable both because his Sebastians betray no discomfort and,\nmore generally, because the context of the saint\u2019s martyrdom has been stripped\nfrom each image. Did Diocletian\u2019s archers not bother tying him to a post or\ntree before shooting their arrow or two? These Sebastians, more than those by\nother Renaissance artists, give the impression that the saint\u2019s identity is\npurely incidental to the figure depicted. Cima has painted pretty male nudes,\nnot Saint Sebastians.\n\n5\n\nThis is the representation of Saint Sebastian taken up by gay artists and\nwriters beginning in the nineteenth century with Oscar Wilde. Guido Reni\u2019s\nSaint Sebastian in Genoa\u2014the one seen by Wilde in his early twenties and, in\nreproduction, by the young protagonist of Yukio Mishima\u2019s Confessions of a\nMask\u2014is distinctive for the sweetness of the saint\u2019s face, contrasting with\nhis mature, muscular body. On its own, the face is that of a child looking up\nat his mother.\n\n6\n\nThe painting is at the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in Berlin. The drawing is in the Louvre\ncollection and was recently exhibited at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco.\nArt historian Furio Rinaldi, who curated the landmark Botticelli Drawings\nshow, has pointed to the figure study\u2019s \u201cspontaneity of execution, absence of\npedantic detail, and creative variations on the [completed painting]\u201d as\nevidence of its preparatory nature. Rinaldi estimates that fewer than thirty\nsheets of drawings by the artist survive.\n\n7\n\nSaint Sebastian was produced during the first phase of Botticelli\u2019s\nindependent career, perhaps a decade before his first mythological painting.\nThe vast majority of his works had been of the Madonna and Child. Except for\ntwo portraits and his personification of Virtue, completed in 1470 for the\nPalazzo Vecchio, all the paintings he made before Sebastian had biblical\nsubjects. Sebastian\u2019s noble solitariness is a quality that characterizes the\nartist\u2019s later figures from classical mythology. Rinaldi has called Botticelli\na \u201cchoreographic\u201d painter\u2014a term that encompasses his figures\u2019 \u201celegant,\nballetic poses\u201d and the dance-like arrangement of those figures within his\ncompositions. I believe the analogy can be extended. Each of his mythological\nfigures, and his Sebastian like them, seem to dance to music that he or she\nalone can hear. This solitary, glyphic nature of Botticelli\u2019s figures is most\napparent in his group paintings Primavera and Birth of Venus, works in part so\ncompelling because the relation of parts to the harmonious whole\u2014of figures to\neach other, the narrative, and the landscape\u2014is so elusive. In both paintings,\neven his slim orange trees do not cohere into a grove\u2014a true garden of the\nHesperides\u2014but remain a grouping of solitary trees.\n\n8\n\nArt historians from Kenneth Clark, in The Nude (1956), to Rinaldi, in the\nrecent exhibition catalogue, have made this connection between the two Early\nRenaissance male nudes.\n\n### Subscribe to Notes of an Aesthete\n\nBy Alice Gribbin \u00b7 Launched 2 years ago\n\nEssays on contemporary arts & letters by Alice Gribbin\n\n66 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n7 Restacks\n\n66\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Muse among the Drafts: Part I\n\nwww.alicegribbin.com\n\n9\n\nShare\n\n9 Comments\n\nLily PrigionieroOver the Tuscan DirtApr 4Liked by Alice GribbinThank you so\nmuch for yet another point of view of this extraordinary artist and subject.\nI\u2019ve restored various renaissance art in Florence, and your essay has inspired\nme to look at pieces I have worked on differently \u2014 an art historian\u2019s insight\ninto aesthetics is different than an art conservator\u2019s.
