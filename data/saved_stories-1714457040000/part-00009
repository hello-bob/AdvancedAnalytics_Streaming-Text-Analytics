Excerpt:\n\n> In 2021, 44 percent of young women in the United States identified as\n> liberal compared with just 25 percent of young men \u2014 the biggest gender gap\n> in 24 years of polling.\n>\n> The [gender-equality] paradox is straightforward: Societies with higher\n> levels of wealth, political equality, and women in the workforce show larger\n> personal, social, and political differences between men and women. In other\n> words, the wealthier and more egalitarian the country, the larger the gender\n> differences.\n>\n> The pattern exists not just for political ideology but also for things like\n> academic preferences, physical aggression, self-esteem, frequency of crying,\n> interest in casual sex, and personality traits such as extraversion. In all\n> these categories, the differences have been largest in societies that have\n> gone the furthest in attempting to treat women and men the same.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> The gender-equality paradox might also help to explain why the gender gap in\n> political orientation has grown among young people. One natural explanation\n> is that young women are outpacing men in higher education, with men now\n> making up just 40 percent of college students. Some evidence suggests that\n> college tends to cultivate more liberal attitudes.\n>\n> However, even among college students, women are more left-leaning than men.\n> A Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression survey of 254 colleges and\n> universities found that 55 percent of female students identify as liberal,\n> compared with only 40 percent of male students. Interestingly, at schools\n> ranked below 200 by US News and World Report, 45 percent of women and 33\n> percent of men identify as liberal. At top 25 schools, though, the\n> difference is more pronounced, with 71 percent of women and 54 percent of\n> men identifying as liberal.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> In the most equal nations of the world, it\u2019s not harsh gender socialization\n> by parents and media, strict societal expectations, or institutional forces\n> that widen the differences between men and women. In the absence of dire\n> poverty and strict social expectations, people are in a position to express\n> their intrinsic attributes and preferences.\n>\n> The freer people are and the more fairly they are treated, the more\n> differences tend to grow rather than shrink. Thus, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised\n> that Gen Z men and women are diverging along political lines to a greater\n> extent than earlier generations did.\n\nDo read the whole thing here.\n\n###\n\nLinks and recommendations\n\n  * \"All the memories, the emotions were all still there on some level.

And in order to do that, my schedule has to be clean. My mind and my time must be free. This was how simultaneously I wrote a book, completed my PhD thesis, and built a newsletter. Each minute spent screwing around on social media or traveling on the road to another gig is a minute I\u2019m not actively thinking, reading, writing, and so on. In his biography about the Russian-British philosopher Isaiah Berlin, the author Michael Ignatieff notes that in the old days, to be a good scholar, you had to have lots of unstructured time to connect dots that most people are understandably too busy to immediately notice. You have to be a little bit selfish. The comedian Adam Carolla says \u201cI like to work really hard, but only once in a while.\u201d Many people in creative professions are like this. They kind of bob around for a while thinking about things. They do a few live events, take part in a few low-effort endeavors. And then suddenly, when the moment is right, the person devotes an enormous amount of time or energy to a passion project. This is the right job for me. I\u2019ll read a few books. Browse some academic papers. Take walks. Write notes. Hit the gym. Take a few meetings. Go to Paris for a weekend. Write some essays. Visit my sister in California. Fire off a few tweets. It\u2019s a pretty good life. But first I had to be a normal person working a series of tough jobs for a while and had to learn something about the value of real work in order to be in a position to be thankful for how things are now. At some point I\u2019ll start getting restless, talk to my agent, and maybe see about doing another book or something. But I have a lot of essays I want to write first. Which requires keeping a relatively unoccupied calendar. Jordan Peterson has described how when he was writing Maps of Meaning, the book out of which many of his other ideas grew, he had to make painful sacrifices with his time.\n\nLikewise, from the classic 1986 talk \u201cYou and Your Research,\u201d by the\nmathematician Richard Hamming:\n\n> \u201cGiven two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages\n> day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously\n> more productive over a lifetime...I don't like to say it in front of my\n> wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have\n> to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done. There's no\n> question about this...Everybody who has studied creativity is driven finally\n> to saying, \u2018creativity comes out of your subconscious.\u2019 Somehow, suddenly,\n> there it is. It just appears. Well, we know very little about the\n> subconscious; but one thing you are pretty well aware of is that your dreams\n> also come out of your subconscious. And you're aware your dreams are, to a\n> fair extent, a reworking of the experiences of the day. If you are deeply\n> immersed and committed to a topic, day after day after day, your\n> subconscious has nothing to do but work on your problem. And so you wake up\n> one morning, or on some afternoon, and there's the answer. For those who\n> don't get committed to their current problem, the subconscious goofs off on\n> other things and doesn't produce the big result. So the way to manage\n> yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let\n> anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts on\n> the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your\n> problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning,\n> free.\u201d\n\n###\n\nThree new reviews of Troubled\n\n  * No haven by Steven McGregor (The New Criterion)\n\n    * Excerpt: \u201cIt would be easy to dismiss this conclusion as the latest version of Marx\u2019s class envy...But Henderson is making a much different claim...He is attempting to defend the family rather than destroy the class system.\u201d Steve gets it.

Among previous generations, researchers often found that those engaged in\npolitical activism were happier. Yet more recent studies of young activists\nfind the opposite: those who are politically active nowadays usually have\nworse mental health. (source: The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt).\n\n2\\. Prior to age 32, each additional year of age at marriage reduces the odds\nof divorce by 11%. However, after 32 the odds of divorce increase by 5% per\nyear. For almost everyone, the late twenties seems to be the best time to tie\nthe knot. (source).\n\n3\\. From a recent paper titled \u201cNegativity drives online news consumption,\u201d\nthe authors find that each additional negative word in a headline is\nassociated with a 2.3% increase in click-through rate (source). Most frequent\nnegative words in headlines:\n\n1\\. Wrong\n\n2\\. Bad\n\n3\\. Awful\n\n4\\. Hate\n\n5\\. War\n\n6\\. Worst\n\n7\\. Sick\n\n8\\. Fight\n\n9\\. Scary\n\n10\\.

Had I\nbeen an Indian immigrant instead of being born here I might have studied a\nstem field but I felt more free to pick what I wanted to learn instead. In\nless equal countries women are likelier to study stem. When you point this out\npeople think you\u2019re being sexist. So more women go to college than men, and\nmore women study the liberal arts than men, which puts the political\ndifferences on overdrive because leftists and woman are the vast majority of\nprofessors in many of those fields. It\u2019s a snowball. And none of my single\nwomen friends realize that men\u2019s lower aggregate economic prospects and fewer\ngoing to college are major reasons they are still single. It\u2019s a shame because\nno individual woman can do anything about it, and I fear we\u2019re headed off the\ncliff of population decline because men mate horizontally and down and women\nhorizontally and up. I\u2019m not sure anyone will convince women to mate\nhorizontally and down based on educational attainment, and people of different\nclasses don\u2019t even mix.Expand full commentLike (13)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n3 replies\n\nFrank LeeSocial Misfit NewsletterApr 28\u00b7edited Apr 28There is no time in\nhistory where humanity has attempted this current Western experiment of a\nfemale dominated society. I don't think it is going very well. I think as a\nspecies we have not evolved nearly fast enough to adopt what are significantly\ndisruptive changes to almost everything. I am not optimistic about the\nfuture.In my long corporate career observing and experiencing gender\ndifferences in the workplace, there is a profound difference in how females\ntend to forge, maintain and manage relationships... and much of their tendency\nis not healthy for the work culture. I would bet that this behavior is based\non years of tribal evolution... where female interactions and behaviors have\nbeen patterned for survival and thriving in the context of their existence.\nThose impulses seem very baked-in and often at odds with how people should\nbehave to optimize outcomes.For example, I have situations with female\ncoworkers owning personal grudges never go away and they attempt to undermine\nand destroy the reputation of other people, but in a stealth mode. Typically\nfor the male employees conflict is open and direct and can be cleared up so we\ncan move on. When you add up all the unresolved conflict in a workplace with\nmany females, trust evaporates and the work culture devolves.Females tend to\nweirdly gravitate toward a collectivist model of cooperation while internally\nand individually making cooperation more difficult.I am generalizing here as\nthere are males that do the same. But there is a definite gender difference\nand I think much of the chaos we all feel in our politics and society are\nrelated to this domination of females and the backroom and underground\ncharacter assassination tendency they demonstrate.Expand full commentLike\n(5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n9 more comments...\n\nNo One Expects Young Men To Do Anything and They Are Responding By Doing\nNothing\n\nGarbage in garbage out\n\nApr 24, 2022 \u2022\n\nRob Henderson\n\n626\n\nShare this post\n\n#### No One Expects Young Men To Do Anything and They Are Responding By Doing\nNothing\n\nwww.robkhenderson.com\n\n13\n\nHow I Read\n\nNon-secrets for voracious reading\n\nNov 5, 2023 \u2022\n\nRob Henderson\n\n1,147\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How I Read\n\nwww.robkhenderson.com\n\n29\n\nBook Stores Refuse To Host An Event For My Book\n\nI\u2019m an unwelcome author\n\nJan 14 \u2022\n\nRob Henderson\n\n878\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Book Stores Refuse To Host An Event For My Book\n\nwww.robkhenderson.com\n\n88\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rob Henderson\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
