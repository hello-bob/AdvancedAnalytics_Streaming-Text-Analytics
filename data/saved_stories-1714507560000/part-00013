I'm Quitting. Here's Why.\n\nAmericans are letting education fall apart. Politicians are helping it.\n\nJessica Wildfire Apr 27, 2024\n\nPhoto by Philippe Bout on Unsplash\n\nApril 27 2024 10:36 PM 10 min read 80\n\nTweet Share Share Email\n\nMy last raise was a chocolate bar.\n\nMy dean left it in my office mailbox one December. It was one of those\nchocolate bars that looks like a thousand-dollar bill. He thought it was\nfunny. He said it was his way of showing me how much I was worth.\n\nNow a different dean has asked for my resignation.\n\nI have given it to him.\n\nHe has accepted it.\n\nSo, it's official.\n\nI'm done. I'm out. I'm giving up my tenure. I earned that tenure through\nendless nights and weekends in libraries, in front of screens, banging away at\ndeep thoughts on Bakhtin that a few dozen people would read. I earned it\ngrading countless papers and leading countless peer-review workshops. Now, for\nthe first time since my early 20s, there's no more students to shepherd. No\nmore papers to grade. No more pointless department meetings to sit through. No\nmore conferences or professional development workshops that I'm supposed to\nget reimbursed for, but never do.\n\nIt feels weird.\n\nI'm leaving because my university, like so many others out there, refuses to\nget with the times. Six months ago, my dean promised to support my bid for a\nremote teaching position. Nothing would've changed. I've been teaching online\nfor the last four years. Before asking me to quit, my dean scheduled a special\nphone call to ask if I was okay teaching a heavier course load for a lower\nsalary, in exchange for this special concession. On top of that, I was already\ndesigning a slew of new courses they desperately needed. I planned those\ncourses down to the day, and even wrote a free textbook for it along with\nvideos for other teachers to use. I was also unofficially doing administrative\nwork, and that was going to become an official job duty.\n\nObviously, I said yes to a lower salary.\n\nI agreed to do more work for less money, so I could move to a place where my\ndaughter could play outside during the summer, without having to worry about\nrecord-breaking heat domes every week. A place where we could enjoy the spring\nwithout hiding in our bathroom from tornadoes every weekend. We knew we had to\nmove now. If we waited another year, we'd get priced out of the housing market\ncompletely. We're barely hanging on as it is.\n\nI know, so you are.\n\nAren't we all?\n\nNow would be a good time to dispel some myths about college professors. So,\nlook, you know that kind of professor that wore tweed jackets and sat around\nsmoking cigars while pontificating about Robert Frost?\n\nThose dudes are long gone.\n\nThe tweed jacket types started retiring a decade ago. They were the ones who\ntaught one course a semester and went on book tours in the middle of the year.\nThey were the ones who drank bourbon in their office in the middle of the\nafternoon. They were the ones who traveled and wrote snippy book reviews and\nsaid witty things at faculty meetings.\n\nThose were my professors.\n\nBefore they left, they dumped all of their work on professors like me, who\nthought we'd get a taste of that life if we worked hard enough.\n\nDon't get me wrong...\n\nThere's still some aspiring tweed types out there. One of our associate deans\nrecently chided a friend of mine for addressing him by his first name. He\nwanted everyone to address him as Dr. So-and-So. He's trying to be like the\nprofessors of yore, but it's not working very well.\n\nThose days are over.\n\nAnyway.\n\nFor the most part, colleges and universities are run by professors like me. We\ndon't lounge around drinking wine and quoting our favorite books. We work. We\nwork hard. We work nights and weekends. We work during the summers. Everyone\nthinks we have summers off.\n\nNo, that's not how it works.\n\nWe don't get paid during the summer. We still work. We still write books and\narticles. We don't do that for fun. It's required. We edit collections and\njournals. We go to conferences. We go to professional development workshops.\nWe plan courses. We advise students. We serve on thesis committees. We do\nindependent studies, which is basically teaching a course for one or two\nstudents. Sometimes, that's even harder than a regular course.\n\nUniversities profit off that work. So do those giant companies that run the\ndatabases that charge everyone to read our research. So do the other giant\ncompanies that hire our students.\n\nWe don't profit from it.\n\nAt all.\n\nMost of my professor friends can't support themselves. That includes the fancy\ntenured professors, even at nice schools. They have sugar mamas and sugar\ndaddies. They're married to lawyers and bankers, or IT managers. If they're\nlike me, they've got a secret side hustle.\n\nHere's an irony:\n\nMy university forces everyone to disclose outside income. So if you have a\nsecond job or a side hustle, you're technically supposed to report it. You're\nsupposed to ask them for permission. They can say no.\n\nThat's right, the same university that gave me a chocolate bar for a raise\nalso says I can't take on a second job to support my family. They're worried\nit would distract me from all the free work I'm doing for them. They never say\nthis part out loud, but I also think they don't want anyone to ever build up\nany kind of financial cushion or independence. If we did that, they wouldn't\nbe able to push us around. We could actually quit.\n\nThat plan is starting to unravel now. You can only push teachers so far before\nthey've got nothing left to lose.\n\nSo, I'll tell you how much I make as a tenured professor:\n\n$54,000 a year.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI've published three academic books (under my real name). I've won writing\nawards. I've won research awards. I've got spotless teaching evaluations. I've\ngot students writing to tell me how much they enjoy my courses. I'm very, very\ngood at my job. And that's what I make. I'm one unfortunate life event away\nfrom cooking meth out in the desert.\n\nI'm not telling anyone this to solicit sympathy. A lot of people probably\nwonder what's going on with education. Why is it so bad? Why do teachers keep\nquitting? Well, that's why. It doesn't matter whether we're talking about high\nschool or college. We're in the same storm.\n\nMy university is looking at a 10 percent enrollment drop right now. We've been\nlosing anywhere from 3-7 percent of our students every year since I started\nworking here. They won't hire new faculty. They won't fill teaching lines when\nprofessors retire or move. They won't raise adjunct pay. They won't give their\noverworked staff a raise, even when they work just as many nights and weekends\nas we do. They cut programs. They close down entire schools. The money just\ndisappears into a black hole.\n\nOne of my colleagues has been harassing our upper administration for months,\ndemanding answers. Finally, a dean looked him square in the face and said.\n\"You need to drop this, for your own good.\"\n\nHe sounded like a mafia boss.\n\nIt doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out what's going on. I mean, we know\nwhere the money isn't going:\n\nThe money isn't going into classrooms. The money isn't going to faculty or\nstaff, not even to reimburse us for all the professional development we pay\nfor. The money isn't going to scholarships or financial aid. The money isn't\ngoing into better ventilation, even though the pandemic has taught us the\nimportance of clean air. That would make a difference. That would actually\nattract students and give them something in return for their tuition.\n\nWe know where the money goes:\n\nThe money goes to hire new directors of athletics. It goes toward new athletic\nfacilities. It pays for the Starbucks our vice-chancellors love so much. It\npays for the sushi bars they think will attract a \"high caliber\" of student.\nIt pays the inflated salaries of the upper administration, who make healthy\nsix figures even when they're terrible at their jobs.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nOnce someone wiggles their way into upper administration, it's very hard to\nget rid of them. Our last chancellor spent his days holding wine tastings and\nwatching soccer. Everyone hated him. Finally, the board of trustees managed to\noust him, but he left with several hundred thousand dollars in severance pay.\nThe same thing happened to a few heavyweights here.\n\nMy dean thinks a consultant can do my job. He said that if I'm not going to\nstay and physically teach students in a worn out classroom, then he might as\nwell hire a consultant and some adjuncts.\n\nThat's a thing now.\n\nIt's popular for universities to hire consultants to solve their problems. But\nthe consultants can't solve their problems. The consultants can't tell them\nwhy they keep losing students. The consultants can only give them the answers\nthey want: Build another Starbucks, and so on...\n\nConsultants can't tell them the truth:\n\nEducation is collapsing.\n\nIt's collapsing because nobody really cares about it. As a tenured professor,\nI'm not supposed to say that.\n\nIt's true.\n\nNobody really wants to admit they don't care about education. Some people get\nangry when you point out this simple fact. Everyone wants to talk about how\nmuch they care about education. They want to watch movies about great\nteachers. They want to complain about the bad ones.\n\nThey want to pretend to care.\n\nEveryone wants to say, \"You can't throw money at the problem.\" Except that's\nexactly what we do with our problems. Look at our military. All we do is throw\nmoney at them. We throw money at everyone else's military, too. There's always\nmoney for tanks and missiles.\n\nAnd robots.\n\nThere's never money for classrooms. Or textbooks. Or teachers. The schools\nthat are doing well? They're funded by rich parents.\n\nTeachers get it now.\n\nThere's been a major exodus of talent from the profession. It started with the\npandemic, and it hasn't stopped. Teachers are realizing how little they're\nappreciated. They're realizing how little anyone cares. They're tired of some\nbook or documentary casting light on their plight, only for it to fade from\npublic attention as another war or another Donald Trump story distracts\neveryone from our very serious, intractable problems.\n\nIt's nothing new.\n\nHistorically, Americans have never supported public education. I won't bore\nyou with the details, but look into it sometime. The history of education is\nsomething I've researched and published on. Do your homework, and it stands\nout. Since the pioneer days, our politicians have always funded education with\ntable scraps. They hired women and immigrants to do the job, because they\nconsidered it unimportant. They never paid teachers enough.\n\nThey never treated them well.\n\nThere's a reason for that.\n\nPoliticians and CEOs have always wanted kids to be in factories, not schools.\nFor a while, they even designed schools based on factories (and prisons). Look\naround today, and you see the same thought process coming back with a\nvengeance. Our politicians want teenagers to work in construction sites, meat\npacking plants, bars, and fast food restaurants.\n\nThey don't even hide it anymore.\n\nOf course, that's just for the poor kids. The rich kids get an actual\neducation. They get teachers and tutors. They get nice classrooms and\ntextbooks.\n\nI've seen it with my own eyes.\n\nFor a few years, part of my job was to do outreach with high school English\nteachers. So I drove around all over my state visiting high schools and\nobserving classes. The rich kid schools had tablets and chrome carts. The poor\nkid schools had textbooks so old they were falling apart.\n\nThe rich kid schools had happy, well-rested teachers. The poor kid schools had\ntired, stressed, overworked teachers.\n\nThe same thing happens in higher education.\n\nHedge fund managers and CEOs have captured the boards of trustees of most\npublic universities. They're funneling all the money to the top, away from\nsmaller satellite schools like mine and away from the arts in general. They're\ndirecting all the cash and resources to business schools and STEM programs at\ntheir flagships, and they're letting everyone else wither and die. They don't\nwant normal people to get an education, not anymore. They want normal people\nto do undesirable jobs, at least until the right robot comes along.\n\nIf you look at the history of higher education itself, all this fits. In the\nbeginning, universities were never intended for ordinary people. Higher\neducation didn't become an engine of democracy in this country until the G.I.\nBill, after WWII. Universities actually didn't want these students. They were\nalways seen as a problem to be dealt with, and at best a source of income.\n\nYou know what's really funny?\n\nConservatives complain so much about universities as bastions of liberal\nideology and propaganda. It's not really true. Universities are deeply\nconservative at heart, with a crunchy liberal outside. These liberal\nprofessors have no real power. They can't organize. They can't even get living\nwages for their adjuncts. Half the time, they can't even get a sign printed.\n\nSo how are they going to corrupt the youth, exactly?\n\nI get it, though.\n\nThe idea of a real liberal university poses a grave threat to the\nestablishment, regardless of their political affiliation. A lot of rich people\ndon't actually want an education system or the educated population that would\ncome along with it. Sure, it would be better for everyone. But it would also\nmean having to share, and these people have let their greed literally drive\nthem insane.\n\nThey don't know what's best for themselves anymore, much less what's good for\nour civilization. They're just panicking, hoarding money, and then panicking\nsome more. That's why they're all building mega yachts and moving to island\nbunkers. They know they've screwed us all, and they're deeply terrified.\n\nSo, that's why I'm quitting.\n\nUniversities aren't institutions of knowledge anymore. They're assets. They're\nrevenue streams. If they're not generating money for the top, then they only\npose a threat, and they have to be weakened and destroyed.\n\nThese days, it makes more sense to work at Chipotle than to try and become a\ntenured professor. And if that doesn't have \"social collapse\" written all over\nit, then I don't know what does.\n\nI'm 90 percent sure my daughter won't go to college. We won't be able to\nafford it. And it won't be worth it.\n\nWhat will she do?\n\nIn the best case scenario, she'll learn a skill and get a job. She won't waste\nfour years of her life sitting in lecture halls. In the worst case scenario,\nshe'll be living the plot of a Mad Max movie as our ecosystems continue to\ndeteriorate and endless war takes its toll on global industrial civilization.\n\nI'm not sure what her life is going to look like, but I know one thing:\n\nShe's definitely not going to be a professor.\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Featured\n\nSocial Health\n\n### What We Can Learn from Rich Dudes Who Vanish from Society\n\nJessica Wildfire Apr 29, 2024\n\n### Worried About Bird Flu?
