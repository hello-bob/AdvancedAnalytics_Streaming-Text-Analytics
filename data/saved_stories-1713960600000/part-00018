Older VH-3D\nSea King helicopters will continue to transport Biden from the iconic,\ntraditional South Lawn takeoff spot.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe executive-transport fleet consists of VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters, which\nare designated with the \"Marine One\" callsign when Biden is aboard. The US\nmilitary sought to replace these aging aircraft with the newer VH-92 systems\nunder the $5 billion program and has already secured 20 of them from Lockheed\nMartin, Sikorsky's parent company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe VH-92's lawn-scorching problems were first discovered in 2018 during the\nTrump administration, kick-starting an effort to resolve the issue.\n\nPresident Joe Biden boards Marine One for departure from the South Lawn of the\nWhite House on April 19, 2024, in Washington. AP Photo/Alex Brandon\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, noted in a June 2020\nreport on the matter that the military had \"yet to demonstrate that it can\nmeet the requirement to land on the White House South Lawn without causing\ndamage.\"\n\n\"Heat from the auxiliary power unit and/or engine exhaust continue to damage\nthe lawn under certain conditions,\" the GAO wrote at the time.\n\n\"The program is studying solutions,\" the GAO said, noting that those included\ncertain \"aircraft design changes, lawn surface treatments, and operational\nprocedural changes to minimize landing zone risks.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early 2021, the Department of Defense's operational testing and evaluations\noffice determined that \"the damage was found to be primarily due to engine\nexhaust, auxiliary power unit exhaust, and discharge of aircraft fluids onto\nthe grass.\"\n\nHowever, in its 2023 annual report, which was released earlier this year, the\nPentagon said the VH-92 is \"operationally effective for administrative lift\nmissions\" after the helicopter's \"voice communications\" were improved, without\nspecifically mentioning the lawn issue.\n\nA White House official told Business Insider that the respective offices\ninvolved in the program \"are working diligently to ensure a smooth, safe, and\ntimely transition\" from the current fleet of helicopters to the VH-92.\n\n\"This is an event-driven goal, not a time-driven one,\" the official said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Sikorsky spokesperson told BI that the defense contractor is working \" in\nclose collaboration with our Naval Air Systems Command customer and have an\nagreed upon landing zone solution with testing planned to validate and ensure\nthe aircraft meets that specific operational requirement.\"\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Biden joked he was \"sandbagged\" after tripping at US Air Force\nAcademy graduation\n\nWhite House Joe Biden\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
