Over my friend's at the bar, or over a\nstranger's on the subway, next to me on an airplane.Sometimes I'd get really\ninto the game I was watching and start playing it in my head, privately\ncritiquing the decisions of the player... And the thing is, whenever I found\nmyself doing this, I'd want to download the game for myself! Sometimes the\nname of the game was on the screen and other times I had to ask what the game\nwas. Whenever I asked, people were excited to tell me about what they were\nplaying and why it was so great, so I asked a lot.The more I started paying\nattention to mobile games, the more of these kinds of experiences I had... So\nwhen it came to designing my own games, I wanted to make sure they could sell\nthemselves to strangers too. I figured the best approach would be to make\ngames that presented themselves clearly and in such a way that they taught\nanyone watching how to play for themselves. Obviously that's a mouthful so\nlet's just call it making your game 'subway-legible'.Obviously no one piece of\nadvice will make you successful, but I do think finding success relies upon\nfinding the little tricks that work for you, and leveraging them as\neffectively as you can. Designing for Subway-legibility has been a very\npowerful strategy for me.The reason why is that it ends up solving three\nproblems at once. And as a solo developer, any time I can do two things at\nonce, that's a big win.. so three is fantastic.So what are those three\nthings?1\\. It makes implementing your tutorials less work. Your game will be\neasier to comprehend because it is presenting its information and state in a\nway that is designed to be naturally accessible. This means that when you sit\ndown to make a tutorial (which, wow what a nightmare these are), half the work\nhas already been done for you. And a better tutorial means more people who get\ninto your game across all skill-levels.2\\. Improves organic discovery. When\nyour game is good at teaching onlookers to play, it'll draw in more viewers,\nand every player and every streamer of your game can focus on conveying how\nawesome it is, instead of constantly answering questions about how the game\nworks3\\. Easier marketing. Your screenshots and gifs will need little to no\ncontext, which makes pitching for coverage or going viral on twitter a lot\neasier. People say a picture is worth a thousand words, but thats only true if\nthe picture makes sense.Ok I get it you're probably thinking oh zach it's\nreally easy to make games that are subway legible when you make tiny little\nindie games, what about me, with my big fancy pc/console game?well it can be\ndoneThis is a screenshot of Into the Breach, which mostly everyone regards as\na brilliant tactical strategy game, and I regard as an incredible example of\ninformation organization and UI design.This screenshot went around twitter\nbefore the game came out, and I think we can see why pretty easily. Anyone\nlooking at it can immediately tell that it: - Involves huge Mechs and giant\ncity-sized bugs (the word mech is literally written on the screenshot) - Is\nturn-based - You have a number of units. - These bugs are doing something bad\nto the cities and tanks. - Things are exciting and literally on fire - The\nkind of tile you are standing on has a tactical effect (advance wars-style) -\nIt's science fiction and involves TIME PODS (also literally written on the\nscreen, these guys are geniuses)Dang that sounds exciting. I can already\nimagine what this game is like!So how did they make that all so clear?Ok some\nof the things I cover in this talk may seem incredibly obvious, but I find the\nbest design rules are always simple and obvious. This is because they need to\nbe simple enough for you to break them sometimes, and they need to be obvious\nenough that you'll remember to do them.Back when I was in college studying\ndesign I was introduced to the principal of the Three Reads. At least that's\nwhat my brilliant design teacher Deb Hall called it, so that's what I'll call\nit when I explain it to you now.It's the key to this whole thing, and if you\ncome away from this talk with just one piece of information, make it\nunderstanding this.The easiest way to understand The Three Reads is by\nthinking about a concert poster.Say you're making a poster for an event.Lets\nthink about how posters are experienced. Generally, we see them on the street,\nwhich means a poster's audience is primarily limited by how far away it can be\nread! If you can only read it from 10' away, it's reaching a lot less people\nthan if you can read it from 20' or 30' away.That means, that we want to have\nour text be BIG! but we don't want ALL of the text to be big \u2014 that would be\nconfusing, and it would seriously limit the amount of stuff we can put on the\nposter! So what should be big? Probably the things that will convince people\nto walk closer. Essentially, we are designing our poster to pitch itself.Ok so\nFirst things first, who is performing?David Bowie (rest in peace). There's our\ntarget market, if you like David Bowie, you're probably going to approach the\nposter. If you don't like David Bowie, I don't care about you anyway.So that\nis the first read. The first thing people see when they see the poster, and\nit's meant to draw people in.The second read is for people who have approached\nand are now looking for more information! Now we don't have to worry so much\nabout how far away they are, so we can make the text smaller.Here's what would\ngo in the second readWhere is this happening? When is it happening? Will it be\nZiggy?Hopefully now the viewer is interested, they like the venue, and they're\nfree on tuesday.Now we're finally to the third read......Where we tell you how\nmuch it costs, remind you of the address, specify the time, and throw in all\nthe extra little details we need that nobody actually cares about like who is\npresenting the show.So there you go! That's the whole thing. It seems so\nsimple right?This kind of design structure works not just for rock posters,\nbut also for videogames. Let's go back to that Into The Breach Screenshot.What\ndrew our eye first?This giant grid, that feels a bit like advance wars, has\nwhat is clearly a player controlled unit, something is on fire, and there are\na bunch of bugs.What do we see next?Whoa look at all these things to think\nabout. It's turn based, I have 3 people, My health seems to be... the power\ngrid? I guess I have to survive 4 turns, I have a mech, and oh it looks like\ndepending on where I place my units there are special effects. wow so it IS\ngonna scratch the advance wars itch that it set up on the first readonto the\nthird read,oh my units have health too! And there are bonus objectives, and\nwhoa look at all this crunchy tactical data going on on the map! And Time\nPods!This screenshot takes you from \"hey is that like advance wars\" all the\nway through to \"wow this is so much more exciting than advance wars\"... Just\nby how the information is laid out!So obviously this kind of clarity can help\nwith your promotion, but how does it help us make better tutorials and improve\nword of mouth?Something you may be familiar with from making tutorials is that\ngenerally when you teach something new, you want to introduce the rules in a\nspecific order, so that players can build a mental model of how the game\nworks, starting with the broad-strokes and then moving inwards towards the\nmore specific rules.Huh. That actually sounds a lot like how the three reads\nworks.The first read pulls you in, and that's the core of your gameThe second\nread fills in key details, or big unintuitive rules.and The third read gives\nyou contextually important information (like the time of the bowie show only\nmatters if i can attend on that date) or gives you contextually important\nrules (like the what tile exactly a giant bug is targeting in Into The Breach\nonly matters if i'm considering how to handle that bug).A good tutorial\nteaches you things in the right order, and good design shows you things in the\nright order. Lets look at my game SpellTower as an example.In SpellTower\nyou're trying to keep your stacks of letters from reaching the top of the\nboard, and you do this by spelling words to remove blocks.Let's see what the\nthree reads look like here.So, the first thing players need to see and think\nabout are the letters! What words are there that I can spell?Once you're\ncomfortable finding words, you need to think about which columns are getting\nclose to the top, and which letters are special and extra helpful for reducing\nthe height of your stacks. The blue letters for example, will clear out an\nentire row if they're used.Finally, the third read, the information that is\nonly contextually important \u2014 things like what your highscore is, or which\ntiles can only be used in 4-letter or longer words.The layout reinforces how\nto approach the game, both for the player, and for someone looking over their\nshoulder.That's it for how to do the Three Reads properly, Before we move on\nto advanced concepts let's take a quick look at what this can look like when\nit goes wrong.This is slay the spire, a game I enjoy quite a lot. In fact,\nit's a game a lot of people really enjoy, and it's one that has done very well\nfor itself, so I don't feel terrible subjecting it to a tiny bit of\nconstructive criticism.Slay The Spire actually does a really great job\nteaching the player how to play it, every single thing on this screen tells\nyou what it means when you mouse-over it, and new concepts are doled out at a\nleisurely pace so by the time you end up with a screen like this, you\nunderstand every single thing.The problem comes in when someone starts\nwatching over your shoulder (or more often with a PC game like this, on\nTwitch).If you have never played Slay The Spire, you probably wouldn't guess\nthat the most important information on the screen is actually these little\nicons (circled in red). Those icons, more than the health, the armor, or the\ncards in hand, explain the state of the battle.Not only are they the tiny, but\neven if onlookers notice them, they have no idea what they mean. These should\nbe in the second read, but they've been relegated to the third.On top of that,\nthis screen has a ton of empty space on it, but it still manages to look very\nbusy. Nearly everything on this screen is a tiny icon with a number on it.What\nare all of these things? (yellow) and how can you have something but have zero\nof it? (white) Why is my health in two places, and two colors? (arrows) And\nwhat are these Decks? (white) do they really need numbers? Couldn't number of\ncards be shown by size, and you wouldn't know this from the presentation, but\nthey're actually the same deck. The right side is the discard. Shouldn't those\ncards be face up?The problem isn't that all these icons are all displayed,\nIt's that they're displayed at relatively the same scale, and that scale is\nlarger than the things that actually matter in the moment, namely the tiny\nicons i outlined in red.Here's what the reads of slay the spire look\nlike:First Read: two characters, a hand of cards, an end turn button and the\nmana. So far so good!Second Read: Almost everything else. Uh oh.Third read:\nsome small numbers and the all important status icons under the health barsSee\nhow you can barely even tell the difference between the second and third\nreads? That is a pretty big sign that the second read is really overloaded.I\njust want to remind you, I do love this game! if you worked on this and are in\nthe audience, thank you for making such a great game! Also, I should say, slay\nthe spire does actually mitigate a lot of this with really solid animations,\nthat doesn't forgive the issue, but it helps a lot. Speaking of\nanimation...Ok. Hopefully you have a sense of what the first, second, and\nthird read should look like. Now I'm going to cover some advanced stuff that\nposters can't do.Unlike traditional print design, videogames, obviously, are\ninteractive, and can move, and that provides you with a few additional options\nas a designer.One of those options is using movement and animation to\ntemporarily raise or lower the read of a game component. Blizzard does this\nreally well in their game Hearthstone.pay attention to the size changes and\nmovement in the above video, and how they draw your eye.Hearthstone is a\nconstant wave of things being brought to your attention in the first read, and\nthen fading back into the second or third reads. It's really masterful, but\nit's also a lot to consider as a designer, especially as you're just trying to\nlearn about this stuff for the first time now. There's literally so much\ninformation being conveyed in this little video that if I tried to deconstruct\nit, it would take most of this talkSo lets take a look at much smaller\nexample, in how I am trying to solve a rules comprehension problem in my game\nTypeshift.This is what a puzzle looks like in typeshift. Like SpellTower, the\nfirst read is the letters, the second is the background tile colors, and the\nthird is the menus and minor decorative elements.A longstanding issue I've had\nis that some players jump to the conclusion that their goal is to find *every\nword* in a Typeshift puzzle (because thats how most word-finding puzzles\nwork). Actually though, in Typeshift, their goal is just to use every letter\nat least one time.I tried to make this clear in the tutorial by showing that\nmaking a word turns your tiles green, and then saying that the goal is to turn\nall the tiles green, but that wasn't good enough for many players.The problem\nis that the colored tiles are on the second read, and when they change color,\nit's just as players are finding a word, so they're focusing on the idea of\nfinding words and their presumption that they have to find them all. They\ninterpret the color change as a decorative element.Click the video above to\nsee what that looks like.I'm about to launch an attempted fix that uses\nanimation to bring tile backdrops temporarily into the first read, and I'm\ndoing that animation just after they've found a word - a time when players\naren't yet focusing on finding something newSo that looks like this (video\nabove). It's a small adjustment, animating the color-change across the\nletters, instead of having it pop in, but it reinforces the importance of the\ncolor as more than decoration, because things in the first read are never\npurely decorative. I never would have come to this change, if I hadn't been\nconsidering the problem within the context of three reads. We'll see how it\nworks out.Another thing you can do in a game that you can't in a poster is\nprovide hidden, toggled, information.In really bad chess, I needed to have a\nbunch of menus on the screen to allow you to use undos, check scores, or just\nquit the game.Unfortunately, those menus are horribly distracting. The problem\nis that in chess, the pieces are little. They're the most important thing on\nthe board, but they're also very small, and very detailed, and can end up\nbeing overwhelmed by large simple shapes, like the menus. When I look at this\nscreenshot, my eye is first drawn to the menus, and then to the board.The\nproblem is that the menus have invaded the first read. Not only do they pull\nyour eye away from the board, but they are also silently telling the player:\nThese menus are the most important thing\u2014 and they aren't!So to solve this, I\nmade it so whenever you tap away from the menus, they slide out of the first\nread, and into the fourth, which is what I call the read for any hidden\ntoggled information.Now, the board, and the mode, are squarely in the first\nread, and everything looks balanced.And when you do toggle open the menus,\nwhile they are in the first read, they're also what you're looking at, so it\nall feels natural.Ok, lastly let's take a look at my game Sage Solitaire,\nprobably my most complex layout for setting up the three reads in a mobile\ngame.While designing Sage I had an issue where I had to include a lot of\nspecific extra information on the screen that could be extremely distracting.\nMy initial layout looked like this:What a mess! The first read is the cards,\nfor sure, but read two, is basically everything up top. The name of hand, the\nstack of cards, the bonus suit, the trashes. It all blends together.The\nproblem was most these things shouldn't even be in the second read.\\- the\nstack of cards is really just decorative - the bonus suit (you really only\nneed to reference it sometimes) - how many trashes remain \u2014 important, but not\nimportant all the time.Worse, there is actually something up there that you do\nneed to know constantly, and that is the name of the hand you're playing and\nhow many points it's worth.If you didn't already know how to play, this\ncertainly isn't going to help you.So, my solution was to break the screen down\ninto a big play area containing the first and second reads, and a small side-\ncolumn with all of the third read information.Let's break it down.The first\nthing you see is the cards,The second is the hand and the cash in button,and\nlast, you see the trashes, the suit, the score, a hint button, and your used\ncard pile.There's also a bit of a trick in this layout. Normally it would be\nan issue to have components that aren't always visible occupying the entirety\nof read 2. Sage would look really weird if both of these bars were gone when\nyou didn't have a hand hilighted.I deal with that by not actually getting rid\nof the top one. When a hand isn't selected in Sage, it looks like this:The\ncash in button is gone, but the big banner at the top now says 'Tap For\nHandList'. It's a giant help button.I could have made it a little icon you\ntap, and stuck it in the 3rd read. But I wanted to drive home, both to new\nplayers, and also to over-the-shoulder players, that this is a game about\nmaking hands.Usually in Solitaire you're moving cards around and making\nstacks, but Sage is about finding poker hands. Having the giant hand-list\nbutton existing as the entire second read (when you don't have a hand\nselected) prompts new players and watchers to think, \"oh, I guess this is\nabout hands\". It also gives new players who may not know the standard poker\nhands a huge help button for them to push and be comforted by.So there you go,\nnot so bad right? lets recap: You have three standard reads:The first read\npulls you in, and it explains the core of your gameThe second read fills in\nkey details, or big unintuitive rules.and The third read gives you\ncontextually important information (contextually important rules).You also\nhave a 4th read that comes from toggled informationAnd the ability to move\nthings up and down in the reads structure through movement and animationAnd if\nyou do all of this stuff correctly, you get Subway-Legibility:\\- It becomes\nmuch less work to make a great tutorial - People see your game out in the\nworld or on twitch and want to get it - and Explaining what your game is with\na screenshot or animated GIF becomes simpleI hope that was helpful! Thanks  \n---\n\n", "frontpage": false}
