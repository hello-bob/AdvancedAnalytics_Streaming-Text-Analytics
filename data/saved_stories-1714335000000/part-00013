A thick methane atmosphere enshrouded\nthe planet. The sea gleamed a metallic green, and where barren rock touched\nthe water, minerals oozed out. Estuaries, creeks, and mud flats teemed with\nmicroscopic life\u2014single-celled bacteria and archaea. This wasn\u2019t life at its\nemergence on Earth. This was life on Earth at adolescence, age 1 billion.\n\nLife thrived on the edges, where water met air and air met rock. These\norganisms carved out a living with metabolisms that drew energy from minerals\nand gases.^1 But life was a slog. Sulfur and nitrogen, the elements that\nprovided the highest energy currency at the time, were hard to come by,\nreleased slowly by weathering rocks. Hydrogen gas, another prized commodity,\nwas voraciously consumed and turned to more methane.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThen along came a rebel, a form of bacteria that discovered a way to live on\nwater and sunlight alone.\n\nOutwardly, little distinguished the mutineer from other single-celled microbes\nof its time, other than its blue-green color, which eventually gave it its\nname, cyanobacteria. But on the inside, from the abundant fuels of sunlight\nand water, cyanobacteria generated more energy than any lifeform before. This\nnew chemical process unleashed a gas that would forever change the trajectory\nof life on Earth: oxygen.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> Tiny cells, preserved for 14 percent of the entire universe\u2019s lifespan, have\n> been waiting.\n\nToday, oxygen feels synonymous with living, but to most organisms inhabiting\nadolescent Earth, it was lethal. Oxygen is highly reactive\u2014it strips electrons\noff metals and possessively attaches itself to elements like nitrogen and\nsulfur, breaking the otherwise stable molecules most microbes had relied on\nfor survival. Inadvertently, the new arrival was making the little food\navailable to microbes inedible. When not reacting with other elements, O_2 is\nso rapacious it reacts even with itself, releasing free radicals. These\nfragments of molecules are so unstable they will attack most chemical bonds\nindiscriminately, wreaking biological havoc. Exposed to high doses of such\nradicals, all living cells quickly corrode. It\u2019s a wonder cyanobacteria\nsurvived their own gas. Essentially, they were setting themselves on fire.\n\nThe first cyanobacteria might have experimented with oxygen-producing energy\nonly when they ran out of other fuel\u2014a last resort to be used in times of\ndesperation until they gradually evolved the ability to detoxify the oxygen.\nWith Earth\u2019s abundance of water and light, cyanobacteria had happened upon an\nuntapped font of energy. Once they landed on a way to oxidize water without\nself-destruction, a revolution was afoot.\n\nThat revolution was photosynthesis, harnessing power from light (\u201cphos\u201d in\nancient Greek). Cyanobacteria gathered the sun\u2019s rays and directed their force\nto split water particles. Breaking water unleashes a powerful torrent of\nenergy, which the cyanobacteria converted into energy currency, a sugar to\nstore and feast on when needed. The possibilities photosynthesis offered were\ntoo numerous compared to the setbacks; there was no putting the genie back in\nthe bottle.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe innovation of photosynthesis also opened the door for other microbes to\nprofit from the energy that cyanobacteria captured from the sun. Without this\nincendiary reaction, there never would have been enough energy in the food web\nto produce more complex life, to produce moss or millipedes or house cats or\nus. And their descendants\u2014modern cyanobacteria, as well as every light-hacking\norganism on the planet\u2014continue to thrive today, and produce the oxygen we\nbreathe.\n\nPiecing together a story of organisms that lived 3 billion years ago\u2014that were\ntoo small for our eyes to see and that lived on such a radically different\nworld\u2014itself feels a bit like mythmaking. We barely know a fraction of the\nmicrobes currently alive on Earth. How can we dare to concoct an origin story\nfor one that lived so long ago?\n\nFor centuries, the best and most direct evidence we have had for long-gone\norganisms has been fossils. And new technology has shrunk down this hunt from\ngiant dinosaur femurs to miniscule microfossils.^2 In her lab at the\nUniversity of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, biologist Emmanuelle Javaux uses electron\nmicroscopes\u2014and even chemical-tracing\u2014to search for the ancient and seemingly\nunseeable. The oldest cyanobacteria that have been identified in the fossil\nrecord date to the Proterozoic, a period some 1.9 billion years ago. The\ndiscovery boggles the mind: tiny cells, just 10 microns long, preserved for 14\npercent of the entire universe\u2019s lifespan. They have been waiting, in a layer\nat the top of a microbial mat that had turned into dense crystalline rock. It\nwas, unmistakably, a cyanobacterium. \u201cAnd the way they divide is very similar\nto some modern cyanobacteria,\u201d Javaux says.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIn a more recent find, Javaux has dissected cyanobacterial microfossils to\nreveal intricate structures within their cells\u2014small membranes that present\nthe first \u201cdirect evidence of a cell performing oxygenic photosynthesis,\u201d she\nsays.^3 The tiny cells in question are 1.75 billion years old. Additional\nchemical analysis can reveal clues about early cyanobacteria\u2019s metabolism and\nbiology. But, for Javaux, \u201cI am always amazed to find such old cells and look\nat them under the microscope ... they are treasures.\u201d Even these incredibly\nancient microfossils, however, are roughly 1 billion years too young to\nreconstruct a proper origin story of the intrepid inventors of\nphotosynthesis.^4\n\nIn the absence of ancestral fossils, other scientists are scrutinizing the\ngenomes of microbes alive today, the living descendants. \u201cBecause we\u2019re using\ngenes and phylogenies, we can work backward in time earlier than the fossil\nrecord,\u201d says Greg Fournier, professor of geobiology at MIT. Identifying\npieces of microbial genomes that are the oldest becomes scientists\u2019 first step\nto building a partial profile of the original rebel.\n\nBut tracing the evolutionary path backward using only modern cyanobacteria is\nalso difficult. \u201cWe don\u2019t have direct ancestors,\u201d Fournier says. \u201cWe have this\nbig, long branch in our tree that separates cyanobacteria from everything\nelse. Along that branch, all of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis must\nhave occurred,\u201d but the stepping-stones are unknown. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re out there\n... but we haven\u2019t found them yet,\u201d Fournier says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like\ntrying to understand something about human evolution without any knowledge of\nthe great apes,\u201d adds Woodward Fischer, professor of geobiology at Caltech.\n\nAnother intriguing way to decipher the history of these planet-changers is to\nstudy the environmental signature of their exhales. Because of oxygen\u2019s\nreactive properties, particularly the rusting effect it has on iron, oxygen\nemissions on a large scale leave a discernible trace in the rock record. A\nmajor geological turning point in our planet\u2019s history is the \u201cGreat Oxidation\nEvent\u201d\u2014or GOE for short\u2014dated to 2.4 billion years ago. It is then that oxygen\ngas for the first time reached a level of 1 to 5 percent of the atmosphere\u2019s\ncomposition (still just a gasp from today\u2019s 21 percent). Given that much of\nthe initial gas produced would have reacted with other chemicals and been\nimmediately sucked up, scientists conjecture that only sustained\ncyanobacterial effort could have led to such a dramatic buildup in the\nplanet\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

It is possible that these are either the vestiges of cyanobacterial\nexperimentation, as described by Fournier, or these emissions may have non-\nbiological sources. There are certain geological scenarios where minerals are\ndeformed under mechanical stress and forced to react with water, releasing\noxygen.^6\n\nThese might also be parallel narratives converging on a single story:\nCyanobacteria first evolved 3 billion years ago, but it took them\u2014and likely\nan assist from geological processes\u2014another 600 million years to oxidize the\nplanet. \u201cYou can divide Earth history in about half,\u201d Fischer says, \u201cthere\u2019s a\nhalf without oxygen and a half with oxygen,\u201d before and after the GOE\u2014before\nand after cyanobacteria gained steam with their revolution.\n\nThat cyanobacteria prevailed is astounding not just on the level of each\nindividual organism surviving the toxic assault of oxygen, but also given the\ncatastrophic impacts accumulated oxygen had on the climate. Some scientists\nhave dubbed the GOE the \u201cGreat Oxygen Catastrophe.\u201d Not only did it poison the\nair, but it also stripped the atmosphere of its methane blanket. Without a\nwarming mechanism, the globe spiraled into a period of deep glaciation.\nTemperatures plummeted so low, a sheet of ice stretching from the poles to the\nequator turned the Earth into a giant \u201csnowball.\u201d This ice age lasted 85\nmillion years. The survivors eked out an existence perhaps reminiscent of the\nmicrobes that live in today\u2019s polar ice.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe relentless oxygen levels, a lack of nutrients, and the cold temperatures\nwould have turned most of the places where microbes had thrived for 1 billion\nyears entirely uninhabitable. All from a single spark, a microscopic chemical\ntreachery.\n\nWith oxygen ascendent, all of Earth\u2019s previous life forms\u2014obligate anaerobes\n(bacteria and archaea that cannot tolerate even miniscule quantities of\nO_2)\u2014were forced into refuge in environments free of oxygen. They persist in\nsuch refugia today, in stagnant pools, mud pots\u2014like the bubbling acid hot\nsprings at Yellowstone National Park\u2014or near hydrothermal vents deep in the\nocean, pockets of the planet that retain echoes of what most of it once was\nlike.\n\n> Temperatures plummeted so low it turned the Earth into a giant \u201csnowball.\u201d\n\nOther organisms got creative, looping in the newly abundant compound for their\nown benefit. One spinoff was respiration, the metabolic process by which most\ncells that live exposed to oxygen break sugars to release energy. Respiration\nis an ancient metabolic invention and likely evolved just after\nphotosynthesis. But respiration can\u2019t outpace photosynthesis; to remain a\ndominant force in the atmosphere, O_2 must be continually produced.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe single, rebellious invention of exploding water to release energy has not\nbeen repeated in the 3 billion years of continuous innovation in evolution,\nsince cyanobacteria first emerged. Instead, it has passed along the tree of\nlife like a torch of Promethean flame.\n\nThe vegetation that populates our Earth, coloring our landscapes green, relies\non this ancient alchemy. Instead of inventing their own version, roughly 1.5\nbillion years ago a bacterium engulfed a cyanobacterium and incorporated its\nmetabolisms whole into its own cellular blueprints\u2014giving rise to an algal\ncell. This next-level innovation, the enslavement of cyanobacteria, was so\nprofound that oxygen concentrations rose exponentially as algae greened the\nocean. It is estimated that today algae produce roughly half of the oxygen on\nthe planet. Fast-forward another billion years, and a portion of these algae\ngradually evolved into land plants, passing the knowledge of cyanobacterial\nphotosynthesis\u2014nested within its cells\u2014upward along the tree of life.\n\nThe cyanobacteria\u2019s invention has both the simplicity and depth of a creation\nstory. On the surface, all it brings is the union of sunlight and water to\ncreate fuel\u2014and release oxygen. But scientists are still puzzling over the\ninner workings of today\u2019s cyanobacteria. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know all the tricks\nthat allow them to do this so easily,\u201d Fischer says. \u201cYou know, the best,\nfanciest chemists in the building across the quad from me, right?\u201d he\nexclaimed excitedly during our conversation, pointing outside his office\nwindow in Caltech, \u201cThey would just love to be able to do chemistry so\nelegantly, in the way that it takes place in cyanobacteria, algae, and\nplants.\u201d\n\nA single organism can, unwittingly, change the atmosphere\u2014and, with it, the\nentire planet\u2019s trajectory. And although it is difficult to conjure, as we\nlive through a climate catastrophe of our own making driven by high levels of\nCO_2, in the constant, long fluxes of time, there might also be, \u201ca future\nEarth\u2014millions and billions of years down the line\u2014where CO_2 might be so low\nthat it becomes limiting for oxygenic photosynthesis,\u201d Lyons suggests. As our\naging sun burns even brighter then, it might snuff all CO_2 out of the air,\npushing cyanobacteria and the other photosynthesizers to their twilight.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be around to see it\u2014nothing like us is going to be around\nto see it,\u201d Lyons says, but \u201cthe world may return to an anaerobic planet. We\nmay return whence we came.\u201d And the stage will be set for a new rebel.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nReferences\n\n1\\.
