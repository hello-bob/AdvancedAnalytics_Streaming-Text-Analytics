With predictions ranging from $3.8\nmillion per Bitcoin (Cathie Woods of Ark Investment) to being worthless (Jamie\nDimon of JP Morgan), the whole community is engaged in the event.\n\nWith the halving set to reduce Bitcoin\u2019s mining rewards to 3.125 BTC per\nblock, a critical shift is occurring in its economic landscape further\nflattening its supply curve and accelerating the transition from an\ninflationary to a deflationary asset. As time goes by and the scarcity of each\nBitcoin increases, natural economic forces will act to push prices upwards in\nresponse to increasing demand.\n\nAmidst a macroeconomic cultural shift, traditional investments like real\nestate, once favoured by baby boomers, are losing appeal among millennials and\nGen Zers. Instead, the new generations are increasingly turning to\ncryptocurrencies as an alternative investment. They are drawn by the perceived\nadvantages of greater flexibility, lower barriers to entry and potentially\nhigher returns.\n\nIn the following sections, we dive deep into the pivotal factors we think will\nfuel Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise post halving.\n\n  1. Increased Confidence\n\nFrom a code perspective, the protocol adjustment that will occur on block\n840,000 is a relatively minor event. In prior halvings, scepticism towards the\ntechnology and its reliability were constantly questioned. Each halving event\nis psychologically associated with a proven track record that yet again,\nBitcoin will execute against its intended purpose promised in the original\nwhitepaper back in 2008. As an asset class, Bitcoin is still in its infancy\nand halvings bring a boost of confidence to outside observers and those not\nyet invested.\n\n  2. Slowing Inflation Drives Value\n\nThe first lesson in Economics is one of supply and demand. With a reduced\nsupply and a constant or increasing demand, prices will rise in all markets.\nBitcoin is no different in this respect. Its supply is designed to reduce over\ntime and with Bitcoin\u2019s constantly being lost (this is the nature of all\ncurrencies), the only direction for the price to head is upwards.\n\n  3. Hype and Network Effects\n\nHalving events draw substantial media attention with the community actively\ndriving discussions across various platforms. The heightened visibility\ncontributes to a surge in market speculation, fueled by increased liquidity.\nConsequently, the combination of widespread awareness and heightened trading\nactivity propels Bitcoin's price upward.\n\nThe Oxford English dictionary defines a network effect as \u201ca phenomenon\nwhereby a product or service gains additional value as more people use it\u201d.\nEveryday examples of network effects are found on messaging platforms such as\nWhatsApp or Telegram, social media platforms such as Instagram or TikTok and\nonline marketplaces such as Airbnb or eBay. It's not hard to see that in these\nexamples, the greater the user base, the better the experience as a positive\nfeedback loop ensures that an increasing user base encourages and attracts\nmore participants.\n\nWith Bitcoin, as its ecosystem matures, its utility and value proposition\nincreases with each independent actor whether private holder, institutional\ninvestor or state actors begin to increase their own holdings in the\ncryptocurrency.\n\n  4. Easier Access\n\nDemand for Bitcoin has never been higher... and access to Bitcoin through\nexchanges, wallet service providers and now regulated financial instruments\nsuch as the Bitcoin ETFs has never been easier. With institutional capital now\nable to access Bitcoin through their brokers, more companies will have the\nability to park cash assets into crypto assets providing further shareholder\nvalue as we have seen with Michael Saylor\u2019s Microstrategy and Elon Musk\u2019s\nTesla, both choosing to park profits aside in the cryptocurrency.\n\n  5. A Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty\n\nIncreasing government debt over time has led to a landscape of economic\ninstability characterized by cyclical periods of boom and busts occurring\nevery 8-10 years. Amidst the macroeconomic uncertainty, currency devaluations\nare deemed an important tool establishing a gloomy backdrop. In this\nenvironment, Bitcoin is emerging as a prime hedge against uncertainty,\noffering an attractive alternative against the concerns of the current\nfinancial system.\n\n  6. Historical Price (1 year comparisons)\n\nLet\u2019s look at the history of Bitcoin\u2019s price during the halving:\n\nFirst halving happened on November 28, 2012 - BTC $12.54 Price on November 28,\n2013 - BTC $1,050 Percentage increase - 8,650%\n\nSecond halving happened on July 9, 2016 - $640.69 Price on July 9, 2017 -\n$2,565 Percentage increase - 301%\n\nThird halving happened on 11th May 2020 - $8,805.39 Price on 11th May 2021 -\n$56,413.95 Percentage increase - 540%\n\nThis historical growth suggests that Bitcoin has the potential for significant\npost-halving growth, further fueling expectations of a $200k price tag.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile historical trends cannot predict future performance, Bitcoin\u2019s past\nshows us remarkable price surges following halving events. At DefiDive our\nfounders have traded Bitcoin since 2011 and strongly hold a belief that this\ntime will be no different, in a past blog post we set a target price of\n$92,000 per Bitcoin, this year we adjust our target to a 2024 top of $200,000\nper Bitcoin. The price charts show Bitcoin\u2019s gains in the past have been\ninfluenced heavily by huge demand which in 2024 is much more significant than\never before. This moment will signify the first halving since Bitcoin became a\nregulated asset class. Instead of Bitcoiners having to constantly answer why\nwe hold Bitcoin. We\u2019re now finally entering an era of, why don\u2019t you hold\nBitcoin?\n\nCopyright DefiDive \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
