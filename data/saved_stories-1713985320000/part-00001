In return for giving more to their employer, they expect more back\n\nOliver Balch\n\nShare\n\nWhen Marisa Fern\u00e1ndez lost her husband to cancer a few years ago, her\nemployers at the Eroski hypermarket went, she says, \u201cabove and beyond to help\nme through the dark days afterwards, rejigging my timetable and giving me time\noff when I couldn\u2019t face coming in.\u201d\n\nShe had a chance to return the favour recently when the store, in Arrasate-\nMondrag\u00f3n in Spain\u2019s Basque Country, was undergoing renovations. Fern\u00e1ndez,\n58, who started on the cashier desk 34 years ago, and now manages the store\u2019s\nnon-food section, volunteered to work extra shifts over the weekend along with\nher colleagues to ensure everything was ready for Monday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s not\njust me. Everyone is ready to go the extra mile,\u201d she says.\n\nSuch harmonious employer-worker relations are the stuff of corporate dreams,\nand they are no accident here: the Eroski retail chain is part of Mondrag\u00f3n\nCorporation, the largest industrial co-op in the world. As a fully signed-up\nmember, Fern\u00e1ndez co-owns part of the supermarket chain that also employs her.\n\u201cIt feels like mine,\u201d she says. \u201cWe work hard, but it\u2019s a totally different\nfeeling from working for someone else.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s 70,000 other workers. Made up of 81\nautonomous co-operatives, the corporation has grown since its creation in 1956\nto become a leading force in the Basque economy. Eroski is one of its most\nconspicuous manifestations, with 1,645 outlets across Spain. In addition to\nfood, the chain has profitable sidelines in white goods, electronics,\ninsurance and holiday bookings.\n\nInside an Eroski supermarket in Arrasate-Mondrag\u00f3n. Photograph: Markel\nRedondo/The Guardian\n\nMore than its economic success, though, Mondrag\u00f3n has become a beacon for the\nco-operative model, as a more humane and egalitarian way of doing business\nthat puts \u201cpeople over capital\u201d. Every worker has a stake in the company\u2019s\nfortunes and a say in how it is run, and receives a share of the profits. But\nthe goal is more about creating \u201crich societies, not rich people\u201d. That means\nlooking after workers during not only the good times but the tough times, too.\n\nThe lowest point for Maite Aguirrebeitia, for example, came back in 2013,\nwhen, after 20 years\u2019 service, the Mondrag\u00f3n co-operative that she and her\nhusband were affiliated to, Fagor Electrodom\u00e9sticos, filed for bankruptcy.\nDemand for its ovens and household appliances had plummeted after the 2008\nfinancial crisis and despite help from a Mondrag\u00f3n \u201csolidarity fund\u201d, it never\nrecovered.\n\n\u201cI felt this overwhelming sense of pain and grief at the time, as if someone\nclose to me had died,\u201d the 56-year-old communications specialist recalls.\n\u201cPlus we had two kids and bills to pay and so on. The mental stress of it all\nwas huge.\u201d\n\nRather than thank the redundant workers for their service and wish them on\ntheir way, Mondrag\u00f3n committed to find alternative employment for as many of\nFagor\u2019s 1,900 or so workers as it could. After temporary stints in five\nMondrag\u00f3n co-operatives in 2022, Aguirrebeitia found a permanent placement\nwith Mondragon Assembly, a manufacturer of equipment for process automation.\n\nAlthough it has meant a shift in career \u2013 she now works part-time in human\nresources, and part-time as a receptionist \u2013 the security of having a fixed\njob is a \u201chuge relief\u201d, she says. \u201cI always felt confident that somehow I\u2019d be\nlooked after. I talked to other people who were out of work at the time and\nthey had none of that. They were out on the street, totally alone. If I\u2019d had\nto compete in the open job market against all the youngsters coming out of\nuniversity, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have ever found another job.\u201d\n\nMondrag\u00f3n\u2019s human-centric approach originated far from any business management\nschool. Its roots lie in a socially engaged form of Catholicism that gained\nground in the 1940s, during the early years of the Francoist regime. Its\ninitial champion was a Basque-born cleric named Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arizmendiarrieta,\nwho, in 1941, arrived in the small town of Arrasate-Mondrag\u00f3n, about 30 miles\n(50km) south-east of Bilbao.\n\nA statue of Mondrag\u00f3n Corporation founder Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arizmendiarrieta.\nPhotograph: Markel Redondo/The Guardian\n\nTaking it as his pastoral mission to revitalise the local economy, the\ndiocesan priest set up a technical school for young men. A few years later, he\narranged for some of them to take distance-learning degrees in industrial\nengineering. \u201cAfter graduating, they all found jobs in conventional companies\nin the town, but they felt stifled ... they wanted more of a say over their\ndestiny, but their employers thought otherwise,\u201d explains Ander Etxeberria,\nhead of Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s outreach programme.\n\nWith Arizmendiarrieta\u2019s encouragement, five of these first 11 graduates\ndecided in 1955 to set up the now defunct Fagor Electrodom\u00e9sticos. Seeking a\nmodel that reflected their Christian socialist philosophy, they turned to the\nRochdale Pioneers, a group of tradespeople from the Lancashire town who, more\nthan a century before, had established the world\u2019s first co-operative. That\nventure grew to become today\u2019s Co-operative Group, home to the UK\u2019s fifth\nbiggest food retailer and its largest provider of funeral services.\n\nMondrag\u00f3n\u2019s founders adopted wholesale many of the Pioneers\u2019 core tenets. In\ntheir modern-day headquarters, located in a renovated 14th-century tower with\na spectacular mountain backdrop, Etxeberria counts off the group\u2019s 10 \u201cbasic\nprinciples\u201d. The list ranges from the sovereignty of labour and democratic\norganisation (one member, one vote), to wage solidarity and \u201csocial\ntransformation\u201d \u2013 which includes reinvesting surpluses to create new jobs,\nsupporting local charities and community development projects, and\nstrengthening the Basque Country\u2019s Euskara language. Top of the list is\nvoluntary and open membership \u2013 namely, the opportunity for everyone to have a\npersonal stake in the enterprise where they work. As an early version of the\nprinciples reads: \u201cThe first form of elemental justice that we need to\npractise is to consider each other as free human beings.\u201d\n\nAnder Etxeberria, head of outreach programmes at the Mondrag\u00f3n Corporation.\nPhotograph: Markel Redondo/The Guardian\n\nThese values hold true into the present, Etxeberria explains. The salary\ndifferential between the highest and lowest paid workers in Mondrag\u00f3n, for\nexample, remains about six to one; for the largest 500 listed companies in the\nUS, the gap is closer to 272 to one. At the year end, members of Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s\nco-operatives also decide collectively on whether they should pay themselves\nbonuses and, if so, how much. This profit-sharing comes in addition to a base\npay rate that, on average, is 40% above Spain\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nDespite its social responsibility credentials, Mondrag\u00f3n remains a competitive\nbusiness. When Etxeberria presses \u201cplay\u201d on an introductory video, the screen\nshows not pictures of happy workers doing yoga but gleaming industrial\nfacilities and straight-faced technicians in lab coats. Overlaying these\nimages are facts and figures that would have mainstream financiers salivating:\n\u20ac10.6bn (\u00a39.1bn) in annual revenues; a dozen research and development\nfacilities; a global roster of blue-chip clients; and a diversified sector\nspread \u2013 industry, retail, finance and education.\n\nThe same no-nonsense, professional vibe is on show at Fagor Arrasate, a\nMondrag\u00f3n affiliate located on one of the many industrial estates that ring\nArrasate-Mondrag\u00f3n, a vibrant town of cafe-strewn streets and busy bars. A\nspecialist in metal presses and stamping systems, Fagor Arrasate boasts\nseveral hangar-sized workshops full of robotic machinery and giant components\nready for export. \u201cSome of the installations we make for customers can be\nthree to four storeys high, so these are massive, multimillion-euro\ninvestments,\u201d enthuses Edorta Mendieta, the venture\u2019s marketing manager.\n\nPinned to a cork noticeboard beside a busy production line are photos of a\nrecent charity run, a printout of donations to local causes (including \u20ac60,000\nfor a nearby organic food association), and a poster about a forthcoming\n\u201cwomen in science\u201d event. In the centre of the board, an A4 sheet of closely\nprinted text gives notice of the co-operative\u2019s general assembly, where next\nyear\u2019s strategy plan will be put to an all-member vote.\n\nMondrag\u00f3n in the Basque Country, where a number of Mondrag\u00f3n Corporation\u2019s\nfactories are based. Photograph: Markel Redondo/The Guardian\n\nMondrag\u00f3n\u2019s collective spirit also offers an edge with innovation. In a\nprocess that the movement refers to as \u201cinter-cooperation\u201d, co-operatives\nwithin the group frequently swap ideas between themselves and engage in joint\nresearch.\n\nOver the years, many of the best innovations have come from alliances with\nMondrag\u00f3n\u2019s homegrown university. Located on a leafy campus in Arrasate-\nMondrag\u00f3n, the university was set up with a strong practical bent to both its\nteaching and its research. So much so, in fact, that the European Commission\nrecently selected it to co-lead a major \u201cdual training\u201d programme aimed at\nblending academia with business to tackle global challenges such as the\nclimate crisis.\n\nMondrag\u00f3n\u2019s approach has proved itself profitable and resilient, so could it\nbecome a realistic alternative to the modern corporation?\n\nIt\u2019s a moot point. Despite their worker-first philosophy, the movement\u2019s\nleaders are reluctant to denounce the wealth-maximising nature of modern\nmarket capitalism. The reason is as simple as it is awkward: Mondrag\u00f3n must\nactively participate in that same capitalist system for its survival.\n\nThis tactic of being \u201cin, but not of\u201d the world of mainstream business has\nseen the Basque-based movement face charges of double standards. In\nparticular, critics highlight its outsourcing of some of its production to\nlow-wage countries with weaker labour standards, such as China and Mexico.\nMondrag\u00f3n argues that it has checks and balances in place to ensure that its\nforeign business partners uphold workers\u2019 rights, and that keeping costs low\nis part and parcel of staying competitive. \u201cFor us, workers will always come\nbefore capital. But capital is still important because without it we cannot\nfulfil our mission of social transformation,\u201d says Javier Marcos, Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s\ndirector of communications.\n\nRadical as that mission is, its focus is and always has been primarily on el\nterritorio (the local Basque region); less about rewriting the global economic\norder and more about improving co-op members\u2019 lives. That said, if others want\nto copy the Mondrag\u00f3n model, then its doors are always open, insists\nEtxeberria. In the past month alone, he has hosted large groups of\npolicymakers and business students from the Philippines, Brazil and the US.\n\u201cThey come to see if our approach works in practice,\u201d he says. \u201cThey all go\nback pleasantly surprised, I think.\u201d\n\nYoung people, in particular, are attracted to the notion of business and\nentrepreneurship going beyond just the pursuit of profit, but they \u201cdon\u2019t know\nthe co-operative possibility exists,\u201d says Ana Aguirre, a graduate of\nMondrag\u00f3n University. The 33-year-old now co-runs Tazebaez, a worker-owned\nconsultancy and education provider that she and eight fellow students created\nduring their bachelor\u2019s degree. For the few who have heard of co-operativism,\nshe adds, most relegate it in the folksy, do-gooder box. \u201cThe problem is that\nit\u2019s portrayed as something to do with charity or [philanthropic] foundations,\nrather than as a credible business model.\u201d\n\nStudents at the Mondrag\u00f3n University campus. Photograph: Markel Redondo/The\nGuardian\n\nPursuing a co-operative model is far from plain sailing, however. Numerous\nhurdles exist. For one, membership does not come cheap. To join a co-\noperative, workers typically put up a one-off payment of about \u20ac17,000 each.\nPlus, just as they are entitled to a share of any profits, so, too, are they\nliable for any losses.\n\nCommercial pressures can also prove acute, as Fagor Electrodom\u00e9sticos\u2019s\ntroubled history shows. The fact that all major investment decisions have to\nbe put to the vote can also make Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s co-operatives less agile than\ntheir conventional competitors. And finding financing can be problematic as\nthe private capital markets are effectively closed to them, admits Fagor\nArrasate\u2019s Mendieta: \u201cWe can\u2019t incorporate external capital into the co-\noperative\u2019s share capital because we are governed by the principle of \u2018one\nperson, one vote\u2019, which no capitalist investor would accept.\u201d\n\nIn some parts of the world, Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s approach just looks downright weird.\nNo one bats an eyelid at the co-operative model in countries such as Germany,\n\u201cbut with these ideas in Texas or Kansas, you\u2019re basically a communist,\u201d says\nMendieta, only half jokingly.\n\nBest bits: can co-operatives compete with big business?\n\nRead more\n\nAcross Europe, at least, the co-operative model is widespread. In Norway, for\ninstance, co-ops have a strong heritage in the social housing sector. Italy\u2019s\nEmilia-Romagna region boasts a long tradition of industrial co-operatives\nsimilar to that of the Basque Country. And, as well as the Co-operative Group,\nthe UK\u2019s almost 7,000 co-operatives include the mighty John Lewis Partnership,\nwhich has a turnover of nearly \u00a310bn. In total, the EU hosts about 250,000 co-\noperatives, providing 5.4m jobs.\n\nIncreasingly, the movement\u2019s footprint is also being seen in company law.\nGermany has long required corporate boards to have worker representatives, for\ninstance. Similarly, Spanish law allows unemployed people to lump together\ntheir unemployment benefit to set up small businesses \u2013 known as Sociedades\nLaborales \u2013 as long as they are majority owned by their employees. The rise in\nmainstream corporations now talking the language of employee autonomy,\nhorizontal management, dignified wages and similar themes suggests co-\noperativism is leaving its mark on business company practices if not \u2013 yet \u2013\non capitalist ownership\n\nBack in Mondrag\u00f3n\u2019s fort-like headquarters, Etxeberria is quietly confident\nabout the movement\u2019s prospects. Co-operativism, he says, is a little like\nzirimiri \u2013 the Eusakara word for \u201cdrizzle\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the same ideas that keep\nfalling; they\u2019ll settle eventually.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Spain\n  * Euro visions\n  * Europe\n  * Work & careers\n  * Manufacturing sector\n  * Communities\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
