By doing so, the chatbot will be able to respond to questions\nusing the information you provide.\n\n#### How do I add the chatbot to my website?\n\nYou will receive a unique URL, which you can integrate into your website as a\nchat widget, or you can directly link to it from your site.\n\n#### Can I try a demo before I sign up?\n\nYes, we have our own chatbot available on this website. You can test it and\nsee how it works by clicking on the chat icon located in the bottom right\ncorner. It\u2019s been trained using data from our website and is capable of\nanswering questions regarding Ping Parrot.\n\n#### What type of knowledge sources can I use to train the chatbot?\n\nCurrently, you can train your chatbot using your website and FAQ. Through\nwebsite training, the chatbot will crawl the pages of your site, allowing you\nto select the ones you prefer, and then it will learn from their content. For\nFAQ training, you have the option to input your own questions and answers into\nthe chatbot\u2019s knowledge base, from which it will also learn. The more\ninformation you give it, the better it will be at answering questions.\n\n#### How long does it take to train the chatbot?\n\nThe time needed to train the chatbot depends on how much data you give it.\nMore data means better answers but takes longer to train. However, you can use\nthe chatbot after adding some data, and it will keep getting better as it\nlearns more in the background, so you don\u2019t have to wait for it to be fully\ntrained to start using it.\n\n#### What if I change the content on my website after training the chatbot?\nWill you automatically retrain it?\n\nRight now, the chatbot doesn\u2019t refresh its training automatically with changes\nto your website. However, you can manually retrain it by visiting the\nknowledge section in the dashboard, selecting the pages you\u2019d like it to\nrelearn from, and pressing the retrain button. This will retrain your chatbot\nwith the latest content from those pages. We are in the process of automating\nthis task to happen periodically.\n\n#### Is there a free plan available?\n\nYes, we offer a free forever plan that allows you to create a chatbot of your\nown, train it with your data, and embed it on your website. We limit the\namount of data you can train your chatbot on and the number of conversations\nyour bot can have each month, but you can upgrade to a paid plan at any time\nto remove these limits as well as access other premium features.\n\n#### Does it work even if my website is not in English?\n\nYes, Ping Parrot supports more than 80 languages, allowing you to train your\nchatbot in whichever language you prefer. For instance, if your website is in\nSpanish, you can also train your chatbot in Spanish. It will then be capable\nof answering questions in all the 80+ languages that we support. This feature\nmakes it convenient for your customers to receive assistance in their\npreferred language.\n\n#### Can I customize the chatbot to match my brand?\n\nYes, we offer the option to customize the chat widget\u2019s colors, the chatbot\u2019s\nname, its avatar, the welcome message, and the question suggestions (should\nyou choose to include them). We are in the process of adding more\ncustomization options.\n\n#### Do you save the conversations that the chatbot has with my website\nvisitors?\n\nYes, we save all the messages exchanged between your chatbot and your\nwebsite\u2019s visitors. This information helps enhance your chatbot\u2019s performance\nand gives you analytics on its effectiveness. For instance, if you use Ping\nParrot to create a chatbot, you\u2019ll have access to all its conversations and\nadditional details about your visitors, like their location and the device\nthey used to chat with the bot. We ensure this data is stored securely and is\nonly accessible to you.\n\n#### Can I embed my chatbot on multiple websites?\n\nOf course, you can embed the chatbot on as many websites as you like with no\nadditional cost.\n\n#### Do you have an API for Ping Parrot?\n\nCurrently, we do not offer access to our API to users. However, we are\ndeveloping an API that will enable you to interact with your chatbot\nprogrammatically. This will allow you to send messages to your chatbot,\nreceive responses, and perform other actions. We will inform you as soon as\nthe API becomes available for public use.\n\n#### We need a custom integration that isn\u2019t yet supported by Ping Parrot.\nWhat should we do?\n\nIn this case, you can sign up as an enterprise customer, and we will\ncollaborate with you to create a custom pricing plan that suits your\nrequirements. Please contact us with all the details at\nenterprise@pingparrot.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n#### Can I take over the conversation when needed?\n\nCurrently, we don\u2019t provide the capability for you to manually take over the\nchatbot and converse with your website visitors in real-time. However, we are\nactively developing this feature and will notify you as soon as it is ready,\nwhich we anticipate will be in the very near future.\n\n###\n\nReady to\n\nPing\n\nthe Parrot?\n\nBuild your chatbot, train it on your data and embed it on your website as a\nchat widget \u2014 all in a few minutes.\n\nGet Started for Free\n\nNo credit card required\n\n# Ping Parrot\n\nBuild an AI powered chatbot, embed it on your website and let it help you\nhandle customer support.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Ping Parrot.
