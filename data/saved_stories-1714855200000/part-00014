Get funded by Y Combinator.  \n---  \n  \nAugust 2007\n\n(This is a talk I gave at the last Y Combinator dinner of the summer. Usually\nwe don't have a speaker at the last dinner; it's more of a party. But it\nseemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could save some of the startups from\npreventable deaths. So at the last minute I cooked up this rather grim talk. I\ndidn't mean this as an essay; I wrote it down because I only had two hours\nbefore dinner and think fastest while writing.)\n\nA couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third of the\ncompanies we funded to succeed. Actually I was being conservative. I'm hoping\nit might be as much as a half. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could achieve a\n50% success rate?\n\nAnother way of saying that is that half of you are going to die. Phrased that\nway, it doesn't sound good at all. In fact, it's kind of weird when you think\nabout it, because our definition of success is that the founders get rich. If\nhalf the startups we fund succeed, then half of you are going to get rich and\nthe other half are going to get nothing.\n\nIf you can just avoid dying, you get rich. That sounds like a joke, but it's\nactually a pretty good description of what happens in a typical startup. It\ncertainly describes what happened in Viaweb. We avoided dying till we got\nrich.\n\nIt was really close, too. When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about being\nacquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of their conference\nrooms to talk down an investor who was about to back out of a new funding\nround we needed to stay alive. So even in the middle of getting rich we were\nfighting off the grim reaper.\n\nYou may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity meeting\npreparation. You've now done the preparation. The work you've done so far has,\nin effect, put you in a position to get lucky: you can now get rich by not\nletting your company die. That's more than most people have. So let's talk\nabout how not to die.\n\nWe've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups die. About\n10 of them so far. We don't know exactly what happens when they die, because\nthey generally don't die loudly and heroically. Mostly they crawl off\nsomewhere and die.\n\nFor us the main indication of impending doom is when we don't hear from you.\nWhen we haven't heard from, or about, a startup for a couple months, that's a\nbad sign. If we send them an email asking what's up, and they don't reply,\nthat's a really bad sign. So far that is a 100% accurate predictor of death.\n\nWhereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and either sends us\nmail or shows up at YC events, they're probably going to live.\n\nI realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in both\ndirections. Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing from you, you won't\ndie.\n\nThat may not be so naive as it sounds. You've probably noticed that having\ndinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more\ndone than you would otherwise, because every dinner is a mini Demo Day. Every\ndinner is a kind of a deadline. So the mere constraint of staying in regular\ncontact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll\nbe embarrassed to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last\ntime we talked.\n\nIf this works, it would be an amazing hack. It would be pretty cool if merely\nby staying in regular contact with us you could get rich. It sounds crazy, but\nthere's a good chance that would work.\n\nA variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups. There is now a\nwhole neighborhood of them in San Francisco. If you move there, the peer\npressure that made you work harder all summer will continue to operate.\n\nWhen startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of\nmoney or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously. But I\nthink the underlying cause is usually that they've become demoralized. You\nrarely hear of a startup that's working around the clock doing deals and\npumping out new features, and dies because they can't pay their bills and\ntheir ISP unplugs their server.\n\nStartups rarely die in mid keystroke. So keep typing!\n\nIf so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging on they\ncould get rich, you have to assume that running a startup can be demoralizing.\nThat is certainly true. I've been there, and that's why I've never done\nanother startup. The low points in a startup are just unbelievably low. I bet\neven Google had moments where things seemed hopeless.\n\nKnowing that should help. If you know it's going to feel terrible sometimes,\nthen when it feels terrible you won't think \"ouch, this feels terrible, I give\nup.\" It feels that way for everyone. And if you just hang on, things will\nprobably get better. The metaphor people use to describe the way a startup\nfeels is at least a roller coaster and not drowning. You don't just sink and\nsink; there are ups after the downs.\n\nAnother feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a startup is the\nfeeling that what you're doing isn't working. The reason you can expect to\nfeel this is that what you do probably won't work. Startups almost never get\nit right the first time. Much more commonly you launch something, and no one\ncares. Don't assume when this happens that you've failed. That's normal for\nstartups. But don't sit around doing nothing. Iterate.\n\nI like Paul Buchheit's suggestion of trying to make something that at least\nsomeone really loves. As long as you've made something that a few users are\necstatic about, you're on the right track. It will be good for your morale to\nhave even a handful of users who really love you, and startups run on morale.\nBut also it will tell you what to focus on. What is it about you that they\nlove? Can you do more of that? Where can you find more people who love that\nsort of thing? As long as you have some core of users who love you, all you\nhave to do is expand it. It may take a while, but as long as you keep plugging\naway, you'll win in the end. Both Blogger and Delicious did that. Both took\nyears to succeed. But both began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and\nall Evan and Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally. Wufoo is on\nthe same trajectory now.\n\nSo when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look more\nclosely. Are there zero users who really love you, or is there at least some\nlittle group that does? It's quite possible there will be zero. In that case,\ntweak your product and try again. Every one of you is working on a space that\ncontains at least one winning permutation somewhere in it. If you just keep\ntrying, you'll find it.\n\nLet me mention some things not to do. The number one thing not to do is other\nthings. If you find yourself saying a sentence that ends with \"but we're going\nto keep working on the startup,\" you are in big trouble. Bob's going to grad\nschool, but we're going to keep working on the startup. We're moving back to\nMinnesota, but we're going to keep working on the startup. We're taking on\nsome consulting projects, but we're going to keep working on the startup. You\nmay as well just translate these to \"we're giving up on the startup, but we're\nnot willing to admit that to ourselves,\" because that's what it means most of\nthe time. A startup is so hard that working on it can't be preceded by \"but.\"\n\nIn particular, don't go to graduate school, and don't start other projects.\nDistraction is fatal to startups. Going to (or back to) school is a huge\npredictor of death because in addition to the distraction it gives you\nsomething to say you're doing. If you're only doing a startup, then if the\nstartup fails, you fail. If you're in grad school and your startup fails, you\ncan say later \"Oh yeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad\nschool, but it didn't go anywhere.\"\n\nYou can't use euphemisms like \"didn't go anywhere\" for something that's your\nonly occupation. People won't let you.\n\nOne of the most interesting things we've discovered from working on Y\nCombinator is that founders are more motivated by the fear of looking bad than\nby the hope of getting millions of dollars. So if you want to get millions of\ndollars, put yourself in a position where failure will be public and\nhumiliating.\n\nWhen we first met the founders of Octopart, they seemed very smart, but not a\ngreat bet to succeed, because they didn't seem especially committed. One of\nthe two founders was still in grad school. It was the usual story: he'd drop\nout if it looked like the startup was taking off. Since then he has not only\ndropped out of grad school, but appeared full length in Newsweek with the word\n\"Billionaire\" printed across his chest. He just cannot fail now. Everyone he\nknows has seen that picture. Girls who dissed him in high school have seen it.\nHis mom probably has it on the fridge. It would be unthinkably humiliating to\nfail now. At this point he is committed to fight to the death.\n\nI wish every startup we funded could appear in a Newsweek article describing\nthem as the next generation of billionaires, because then none of them would\nbe able to give up. The success rate would be 90%. I'm not kidding.\n\nWhen we first knew the Octoparts they were lighthearted, cheery guys. Now when\nwe talk to them they seem grimly determined. The electronic parts distributors\nare trying to squash them to keep their monopoly pricing. (If it strikes you\nas odd that people still order electronic parts out of thick paper catalogs in\n2007, there's a reason for that. The distributors want to prevent the\ntransparency that comes from having prices online.) I feel kind of bad that\nwe've transformed these guys from lighthearted to grimly determined. But that\ncomes with the territory. If a startup succeeds, you get millions of dollars,\nand you don't get that kind of money just by asking for it. You have to assume\nit takes some amount of pain.\n\nAnd however tough things get for the Octoparts, I predict they'll succeed.\nThey may have to morph themselves into something totally different, but they\nwon't just crawl off and die. They're smart; they're working in a promising\nfield; and they just cannot give up.\n\nAll of you guys already have the first two. You're all smart and working on\npromising ideas. Whether you end up among the living or the dead comes down to\nthe third ingredient, not giving up.\n\nSo I'll tell you now: bad shit is coming. It always is in a startup. The odds\nof getting from launch to liquidity without some kind of disaster happening\nare one in a thousand. So don't get demoralized. When the disaster strikes,\njust say to yourself, ok, this was what Paul was talking about. What did he\nsay to do? Oh, yeah. Don't give up.  \n  \nJapanese Translation| Arabic Translation  \n---|---\n\n", "frontpage": false}
