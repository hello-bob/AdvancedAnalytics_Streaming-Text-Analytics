Large\ndifferences between input and output images indicate potential deviations from\nthe Standard Model. (Image by CERN.)\n\nFor over two decades, the ATLAS particle detector has recorded the highest\nenergy particle collisions in the world within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nlocated at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Beams of\nprotons are accelerated around the LHC at close to the speed of light, and\nupon their collision at ATLAS, they produce a cascade of new particles,\nresulting in over a billion particle interactions per second.\n\nParticle physicists are tasked with mining this massive and growing store of\ncollision data for evidence of undiscovered particles. In particular, they\u2019re\nsearching for particles not included in the Standard Model of particle\nphysics, our current understanding of the universe\u2019s makeup that scientists\nsuspect is incomplete.\n\nAs part of the ATLAS collaboration, scientists at the U.S. Department of\nEnergy\u2019s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and their colleagues recently used\na machine learning approach called anomaly detection to analyze large volumes\nof ATLAS data. The method has never before been applied to data from a\ncollider experiment. It has the potential to improve the efficiency of the\ncollaboration\u2019s search for something new. The collaboration involves\nscientists from 172 research organizations.\n\nThe team leveraged a brain-inspired type of machine learning algorithm called\na neural network to search the data for abnormal features, or anomalies. The\ntechnique breaks from more traditional methods of searching for new physics.\nIt is independent of \u2014 and therefore unconstrained by \u2014 the preconceptions of\nscientists.\n\n> \u201cRather than looking for very specific deviations, the goal is to find\n> unusual signatures in the data that are completely unexplored, and that may\n> look different from what our theories predict.\u201d \u2014 Physicist Sergei Chekanov\n\nTraditionally, ATLAS scientists have relied on theoretical models to help\nguide their experiment and analysis in the directions most promising for\ndiscovery. This often involves performing complex computer simulations to\ndetermine how certain aspects of collision data would look according to the\nStandard Model. Scientists compare these Standard Model predictions to real\ndata from ATLAS. They also compare them to predictions made by new physics\nmodels, like those attempting to explain dark matter and other phenomena\nunaccounted for by the Standard Model.\n\nBut so far, no deviations from the Standard Model have been observed in the\nbillions of billions of collisions recorded at ATLAS. And since the discovery\nof the Higgs boson in 2012, the ATLAS experiment has yet to find any new\nparticles.\n\n\u201cAnomaly detection is a very different way of approaching this search,\u201d said\nSergei Chekanov, a physicist in Argonne\u2019s High Energy Physics division and a\nlead author on the study. \u201cRather than looking for very specific deviations,\nthe goal is to find unusual signatures in the data that are completely\nunexplored and that may look different from what our theories predict.\u201d\n\nTo perform this type of analysis, the scientists represented each particle\ninteraction in the data as an image that resembles a QR code. Then, the team\ntrained their neural network by exposing it to 1% of the images.\n\nATLAS event display for one of eight events contributing to the largest\ndeviation from Standard Model predictions found by the neural network in this\nstudy. (Image by CERN.)\n\nThe network consists of around 2 million interconnected nodes, which are\nanalogous to neurons in the brain. Without human guidance or intervention, it\nidentified and remembered correlations between pixels in the images that\ncharacterize Standard Model interactions. In other words, it learned to\nrecognize typical events that fit within Standard Model predictions.\n\nAfter training, the scientists fed the other 99% of the images through the\nneural network to detect any anomalies. When given an image as input, the\nneural network is tasked with recreating the image using its understanding of\nthe data as a whole.\n\n\u201cIf the neural network encounters something new or unusual, it gets confused\nand has a hard time reconstructing the image,\u201d said Chekanov. \u201cIf there is a\nlarge difference between the input image and the output it produces, it lets\nus know that there might be something interesting to explore in that\ndirection.\u201d\n\nUsing computational resources at Argonne\u2019s Laboratory Computing Resource\nCenter, the neural network analyzed around 160 million events within LHC Run-2\ndata collected from 2015 to 2018.\n\nAlthough the neural network didn\u2019t find any glaring signs of new physics in\nthis data set, it did spot one anomaly that the scientists think is worth\nfurther study. An exotic particle decay at an energy of around 4.8\nteraelectronvolts results in a muon (a type of fundamental particle) and a jet\nof other particles in a way that does not fit with the neural network\u2019s\nunderstanding of Standard Model interactions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to do more investigation,\u201d said Chekanov. \u201cIt is likely a\nstatistical fluctuation, but there\u2019s a chance this decay could indicate the\nexistence of an undiscovered particle.\u201d\n\nThe team plans to apply this technique to data collected during the LHC Run-3\nperiod, which began in 2022. ATLAS scientists will continue to explore the\npotential of machine learning and anomaly detection as tools for charting\nunknown territory in particle physics.\n\nThe results of the study were published in Physical Review Letters.
