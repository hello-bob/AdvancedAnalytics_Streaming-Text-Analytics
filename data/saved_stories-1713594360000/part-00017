This is great news for a retro gamer like myself. Delta is one such\nemulator that currently focuses on Nintendo platforms: NES, Game Boy, Game Boy\nColor, SNES, N64 and DS.\n\nI thought it would be fun to play my favourite Nintendo DS game: MaBoShi. This\nis an odd choice of game for a few reasons, but it really tests what Delta and\nthe melonDS emulation core can do.\n\nImmediately I noticed that the Nintendo DS emulation quality is high:\nMaBoShi\u2019s mosaic transitions are shown, whereas in other emulators such as\nDraStic or DeSmuME they are not. That\u2019s a good start!\n\nDelta's default Nintendo DS skin\u2014pretty nice! BUT\n\n## When good isn\u2019t good enough\n\nBut, we can see some odd things about MaBoShi:\n\n  * it is played with the DS rotated on its side\n  * the second screen goes mostly unused\n\nAnd there are some other things we can\u2019t see:\n\n  * it doesn\u2019t use the touch screen\n  * only the D-pad is used during play (and Start button to pause)\n\nUsually, when I play this game in an emulator I activate single screen mode\nand forgo seeing the high score, which is no big deal as the game ends at 1\nmillion and that\u2019s always my goal.\n\nSo I looked into the Delta docs and skin docs and find that the options to\nshow a single screen, or rotate it, are controlled by the skin (visual theme)\nyou are using.\n\nReading further into skins the capabilities seemed quite comprehensive, so I\nbegan to hatch a plan... maybe I can create a custom skin just for MaBoShi?\n\n## I love it when a plan comes together\n\nHere\u2019s the feature list I came up with:\n\n  1. show the main game screen\n  2. show only the score from the secondary screen\n  3. remove all controls other than the d-pad, start and delta button\n\nI achieved this goal as follows:\n\n  1. define two seperate screens to split the DS image\n  2. rotate each of the screens\n  3. overlap the screens so that only the score from the secondary screen is visible\n  4. rotate the d-pad direction controls\n  5. made the touch/game screen a big button\n  6. make empty space equivalent to nearest button\n  7. create a nice PDF to show the buttons visually\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the JSON associated with this skin, here it is on\nGitHub.\n\n## Maximum joy\n\nInstallation and download instructions are at the bottom of the page, but\nhere\u2019s the final skin:\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the skin you need to do a little bit of busy work, but boy is it\nworth it:\n\n  1. Install Delta and get it running DS games (check this video)\n  2. Create a folder called Delta in your iCloud Drive so you can easily store/retrieve some downloads\n  3. Download the following files:\n\n     * MaBoShi.nds.zip game file\n     * MaBoShi.jpg artwork\n     * MaBoShi.deltaskin custom skin\n  4. Open the .nds.zip game file in Delta\n  5. Tap and hold the game icon to show a menu\n  6. Choose \u201cChange Artwork\u201d\n  7. Select the .jpg you downloaded earlier\n  8. Choose \u201cChange Controller Skin\u201d\n  9. Select the skin using the + button and set it as the Portrait skin for the game\n\nCheck out my MaBoShi Guide at GameFAQs to learn more about the game and how to\nplay it. It\u2019s essentially a one button game so isn\u2019t affected by the lack of\nphysical buttons.\n\n\\-- Originally published: 2024-04-18 -- Enjoyed this blog post? Send blog\nthanks!
