Leonard\u2019s new book Meltdown Expected:\nCrisis, Disorder, and Upheaval at the End of the 1970s (Rutgers University\nPress).\n\nIn the predawn hours of December 4, 1969, fourteen Chicago Police Department\n(CPD) officers, claiming they were searching for illegal weapons, raided a\nfirst-floor apartment on Chicago\u2019s Monroe Street. Inside, nine members of the\nIllinois Black Panther Party (BPP) were in various phases of sleep. While\npolice claimed they were fired on, the fusillade of over ninety bullets hit\nonly Black Panthers. Two of them \u2014 Fred Hampton, the chairman of the Illinois\nPanthers, and Mark Clark, who had organized the group\u2019s Peoria chapter \u2014 were\nfatally wounded.\n\nInitially, the raid was seen as a success for the police, epitomized by the\npicture of grinning cops carrying Hampton\u2019s body out of the apartment, which\ncirculated widely in the press. However, the one-sided nature of the attack\nquickly gave rise to questions. In this, not only were the Chicago police\nunder scrutiny, but questions arose about the role of the FBI, which had been\nkeeping close tabs on the Chicago Panthers. What would later be discovered was\nthat the bureau had a well-placed informant within the group. That informant\nhad passed along a floor plan of the apartment to the CPD, by way of his FBI\nhandler, to facilitate their raid.\n\nTo the degree most people today know the story of Fred Hampton, it is through\nthe 2021 film Judas and the Black Messiah, a fictionalized account of the\nincident. The film, while dramatically riveting, is in important ways\nfactually dubious. This is made clear in the movie\u2019s opening when it has J.\nEdgar Hoover, portrayed by Martin Sheen, proclaiming the Black Panthers \u201cthe\ngreatest single threat to our national security, more than the Chinese, even\nmore than the Russians.\u201d In reality, Hoover never said such a thing, nor would\nhe, given how the bureau and the US government viewed China and the Soviet\nUnion at that phase of the Cold War. Considering the power of such a\nstatement, however, it is worth exploring how a variation of it found its way\nto becoming common knowledge.\n\nIn July 1969, Hoover talked to the media about the bureau\u2019s annual report,\nwhere he highlighted the current threats as seen by the FBI. In turn, United\nPress International ran a short piece titled \u201cJ. Edgar Hoover: Black Panther\nGreatest Threat to US Security.\u201d As the article reported,\n\n> The Black Panther Party represents the greatest threat among the black\n> extremist groups to the internal security of the United States, FBI director\n> J. Edgar Hoover said today.\n>\n> Hoover said in his fiscal 1969 annual report the increased activity of\n> \u2018violence-prone black extremists group\u2019 had put more investigative\n> responsibilities on the FBI.\n>\n> \u2018Of these,\u2019 Hoover said, \u2018the Black Panther party, without question,\n> represents the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.\u2019\n\nGiven the headline, one could be forgiven for thinking Hoover was saying the\nBPP was the greatest threat to the United States, as a whole \u2014 and it is the\ncase that story has been the basis for the claim that the group was the FBI\u2019s\npreeminent target, rather than one of many challenges the bureau confronted,\nin that period.\n\nFBI agent Roy Martin Mitchell developed and handled the informant William\nO\u2019Neal, who helped lead the Chicago Police to Fred Hampton on the night of his\ndeath. (Meltdown Expected by Aaron Leonard)\n\nThis, unfortunately, has had the effect of obscuring other matters also worthy\nof attention. In that respect, two characters who intersected with the Chicago\nPanthers, but also others, are worth a deeper look: FBI informant William\nO\u2019Neal and his handler, Roy Martin Mitchell. William O\u2019Neal was recruited by\nthe FBI in 1968 after he had been arrested by Chicago police. O\u2019Neal had been\ncaught driving a car he had stolen. Nineteen at the time, he told the\narresting officer that he was an FBI agent and flashed a phony ID. The police,\nin turn, referred the matter to the FBI who dispatched Special Agent Roy\nMartin Mitchell to meet with him. According to O\u2019Neal, Mitchell told him: \u201c\u2018I\nknow you did it, but it\u2019s no big thing.\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019m sure we can work it\nout.\u2019 And, um, I think a few, few months passed before I heard from him again,\nand one day I got a call and he told me that it was payback time. He said that\n\u2018I want you to go and see if you can join the Black Panther Party, and if you\ncan, give me a call.\u2019\u201d O\u2019Neal went on to infiltrate the Panthers, first\nbecoming the Chicago chapter\u2019s head of security and later chief of staff for\nIllinois.\n\nO\u2019Neal\u2019s success within the BPP was intimately bound up with his work with his\nFBI handler. In the ranks of the FBI, Mitchell was considered an agent of\nimpeccable quality, as this report from April 1969 affirms: \u201cMITCHELL is a\nyoung Agent who has been extremely successful in the racial field particularly\nin the development of informants. He has developed and is handling an\ninformant in the Black Panther Party who is furnishing extremely valuable\ninformation to the Bureau, and his work in this area has absolutely nothing to\nbe desired.\u201d\n\nAn excerpt from an internal report on FBI agent Roy Martin Mitchell, noting\nhis talent for developing informants in \u201cthe racial field.\u201d (Meltdown Expected\nby Aaron Leonard)\n\nMitchell\u2019s file, released in December 2020 after a Freedom of Information\nrequest by the author, runs nearly nine hundred pages. While the names William\nO\u2019Neal and Fred Hampton never appear in the file, there is abundant\ncorroborating evidence that makes clear it was O\u2019Neal who was the informant\nsupplying the \u201cextremely valuable information.\u201d\n\n# The Hampton Trials\n\nIn the wake of the murder of Fred Hampton, the case became a cause among the\nLeft and the wider progressive community. This in turn led to several cases\nthat wound their way through the courts throughout the \u201970s. In 1972, Illinois\nstate\u2019s attorney Edward V. Hanrahan and twelve others were brought to trial\nfor attempting to stop the prosecution of the police in the case. They were\ncleared in a trial before a judge.\n\nThat, however, was not the end of their trouble. In 1970, a civil suit was\ninitiated by a group of activist attorneys in the People\u2019s Law Office (PLO)\nwho represented Iberia Hampton, Fred Hampton\u2019s mother. That case involved\ntwenty-eight defendants, including Hanrahan, three assistant state\u2019s\nattorneys, the Chicago police officers who conducted the raid, and the FBI\u2019s\nMarlin Johnson, Robert Piper, and Roy Martin Mitchell. The case went to trial\nin 1976 and lasted eighteen months. The judge, who was belligerent toward the\nplaintiffs throughout, ended up throwing out the cases against twenty-one of\nthe defendants before the jury deliberated. The remaining defendants had their\ncharges dismissed when the jury deadlocked on their cases. However, in April\n1979 an appeals court reversed the judge\u2019s decision and called for a new\ntrial. In light of that, the government settled the case, and the Hampton\nfamily was awarded $1.8 million in damages.\n\nIn the course of the obstruction of justice trial and throughout the first few\nyears of the civil suit, the identity of William O\u2019Neal remained a closely\nheld secret. However, developments in an unrelated 1973 case thrust him into\nthe limelight. In that year, Chicago police sergeant Stanley Robinson was\narrested for the murder of twenty-two-year-old Jeff Beard. Robinson, as was\nrevealed at trial, was the leader of a gang of corrupt Chicago cops who, among\nother things, carried out murder-for-hire. The government had built a solid\ncase against Robinson and had established that in May 1972 he, with the help\nof another man, abducted Beard \u2014 under the pretense of arresting him \u2014 outside\na Chicago pool hall. The two then drove the captive to Indiana where he was\nshot, stabbed, and beaten to death.\n\nUnfortunately for Robinson, his accomplice was also a government informant.\nHis name was William O\u2019Neal. While this meant a strong case for the\ngovernment, for the bureau and O\u2019Neal it signaled the end of his role as a\nconfidential informant. It also, when word came out in February 1973, alerted\nthe attorneys in the PLO then pursuing the Hampton civil case that they needed\nto examine O\u2019Neal\u2019s role in the Hampton killing. While they knew O\u2019Neal had\nbeen Hampton\u2019s bodyguard, they had not known he was also working for the FBI.\n\nWith the revelation that O\u2019Neal was an FBI informant, the PLO was able to push\nfor disclosure in the course of its civil suit. One thing it learned was that\nthe FBI had paid O\u2019Neal a bonus of $300 for his work on the raid that killed\nHampton. Not known at the time \u2014 that would take the release of Roy Mitchell\u2019s\nFBI file \u2014 was that Mitchell, too, had been paid a bonus, of $200. As J. Edgar\nHoover noted in a commendation letter to Mitchell, \u201cThrough your\naggressiveness and skill in handling a valuable source, he is able to furnish\ninformation of great importance to the Bureau in this vital area of our\noperations. I want you to know of my appreciation for your exemplary efforts.\u201d\nWhile Hoover was careful not to spell out exactly what the \u201cvital area of our\noperations\u201d was, a notation at the bottom of the letter reads \u201cRe: Black\nPanther Party.\u201d The timing, six days after Hampton\u2019s killing, makes clear what\nthe award was for.\n\nA letter from J. Edgar Hoover commending Roy Martin Mitchell on his role in\nthe killing of Fred Hampton, and enclosing a financial reward. (Meltdown\nExpected by Aaron Leonard)\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover, however, would not be the only FBI director to commend\nSpecial Agent Mitchell for a killing in which his informant was a key player.\nIn 1975, Eloise Beard, the sister of Jeff Beard, filed a lawsuit against\nMitchell. The case argued that Mitchell had deprived her brother of his civil\nrights because of his \u201creckless training and use of an informant.\u201d Mitchell,\nin other words, was culpable for Jeff Beard\u2019s death because of the way in\nwhich he had trained and handled William O\u2019Neal. Mitchell, however, was\nultimately not held to account. In August 1978, a court cleared him of any\nresponsibility.\n\nThat ruling was cause for celebration in the US Attorney\u2019s Office and the FBI.\nIn a January 1979 letter from US Attorney Thomas P. Sullivan to the director\nof the FBI, William Webster, Sullivan was effusive in his praise of Mitchell:\n\u201cIn October of this year, this office had the privilege of defending Special\nAgent Roy Martin Mitchell in a case in which Mr. Mitchell was alleged to have\nfailed to supervise and train an informant being utilized by Mr. Mitchell and\nthe F.B.I. As you are aware, after a three-week trial, the jury deliberated\nfor approximately forty minutes and returned a verdict favorable to Mr.\nMitchell. We perceive that verdict to be a total vindication of Mr. Mitchell\u2019s\nactions and the F.B.I.\u2019s authorization of informants.\u201d The prosecutor\ncontinued: \u201cMr. Mitchell is a man of the highest character, impeccable\nintegrity, and a model F.B.I. agent whose attitude and activities should serve\nas a model for all Special Agents to emulate.\u201d Webster duly passed along the\npraise to the special agent \u2014 while the court decision clearing him\nessentially upheld an informant participating in murder.\n\nWhile the FBI and government attorneys would praise Mitchell, some in the CPD\nappear to have been less enamored. In a scene that might have been written for\na television police procedural, a report in Mitchell\u2019s personnel file recounts\nhis harassment at the time of the Stanley Robinson case.\n\nSpecifically, there is a report on an April 1973 \u201capparently unwarranted\narrest\u201d \u2014 two months before the start of the Robinson trial \u2014 of Mitchell by a\nChicago police officer for \u201cdriving an unsafe vehicle and for driving while\nunder the influence.\u201d Mitchell, who is said to have had a flat tire after\nleaving a dinner with an assistant US attorney, was confronted by a Chicago\npolice officer who demanded that Mitchell, who was not drunk, take a\nbreathalyzer test. When he refused, he was arrested. As an FBI account of its\ninvestigation of the incident reports: \u201c5 other Agents [were interviewed] who\nwere engaged in an investigative assignment with him on the day in question.\nAn AUSA [assistant US attorney] who had dinner with SA Mitchell that evening\nwas also interviewed. There is no indication whatsoever that SA Mitchell\u2019s\nversion of the incident was other than factual.\u201d The FBI then took the case to\nthe CPD hierarchy. As a result, \u201cthe Commander, Chief of Detectives, and First\nDeputy Superintendent, Chicago Police Department (CPD), all apologized: and\nexpressed regret over the arrest of SA Mitchell and advised that immediate\nsteps would be taken to see that no further harassment was taken against him.\u201d\nIt also reported that \u201cthe arresting officer would be admonished for his\naction on this particular occasion.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to de-escalate the incident, the report says that \u201cthe best way\nto handle this current situation in order to avoid allegations of \u2018cover-up\u2019\nwould be to let SA Mitchell appear in court and explain his story to the\njudge.\u201d He was subsequently cleared in court of the DUI, but because of the\nflat tire he was made to pay a $25 fine for \u201cdriving an unsafe vehicle.\u201d\n\nWhile the episode was resolved amicably, it highlights how relations between\nthe FBI and CPD were not without contention, and that neither was fully\nsubservient to the other. This dispels a certain monolithic view often\nascribed to the bureau in its relations with the CPD, including, it would\nseem, in regard to the Hampton case.\n\n# Mitchell and O\u2019Neal\u2019s Complicity\n\nThe FBI\u2019s connection to the Hampton killing continues to carry a certain\nambiguity \u2014 did it know the Chicago police were out to kill Hampton, or was it\njust happy to pass along information that would aid it in whatever suppressive\nplans it might undertake? True, they were pleased with the outcome, rewarding\nO\u2019Neal and Special Agent Mitchell. Less clear, however, is O\u2019Neal\u2019s specific\nrole \u2014 substantial as it is \u2014 beyond passing along the floor plan.\n\nThe Jeff Beard case, however, is less ambiguous on O\u2019Neal\u2019s participation. He\ndrove to Indiana while Stanley Robinson guarded Beard in the car\u2019s back seat;\nhe kept watch over Beard when Robinson stopped to make a phone call; and he\n\u201chelped throw Beard\u2019s body over a fence\u201d once he was dead. In short, his role\nin facilitating the murder was essential. This was the basis for not one but\ntwo lawsuits: one against Mitchell, which was quickly decided against the\nplaintiff, and the other against O\u2019Neal, which garnered a similar outcome.\n\nIn making a final decision on the lawsuit brought against O\u2019Neal, an appeals\ncourt cleared him of all responsibility, finding that \u201cthe issue, in this\ncase, is whether that informant breached a constitutional duty owed to the\nmurder victim and consequently caused the victim\u2019s death. We conclude, based\non the undisputed facts, that he did not and thus we affirm the judgment of\nthe district court.\u201d Put simply, an informant had no obligation to stop a\nmurder; indeed, they could facilitate such, so long as it was in the interest\nof building a criminal case. Given the essential nature of the use of\ninformants, this was a strong affirmation of the use of one of the most\nunscrupulous methods by the FBI and like-minded law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe failure to find William O\u2019Neal or Roy Mitchell as having any\nresponsibility for the Jeff Beard murder and the killing of Fred Hampton was\npart of a larger process playing out in the last years of the \u201970s. Not only\nwas there the legitimation of domestic spying offered by the Levi Guidelines\nand the establishment of the FISC (Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court),\nbut a reaffirmation of the role of the FBI.\n\n#### Share this article\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\n#### Contributors\n\nAaron J.
