The\nnew approach doesn\u2019t use radio waves but an infrared laser and it has now\nshown that it works successfully from the most distant place yet. Psyche was\n226 million kilometers (140 million miles) from Earth when the message was\nsent. That\u2019s 1.5 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun.\n\nPsyche was transmitting its engineering data over radio waves through NASA's\nDeep Space Network. The mission team decided to also transmit the data over\nthe Deep Space Optical Communication system for the first time. The previous\ntransmissions were not data from the spacecraft but test data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe April 8 test showed that even from that distance, the data could be\ndownloaded with a maximum rate of 25 Mbps. This is already well beyond the\nexpected goal of \"at least 1 Mbps\" and is 10 to 100 times faster than radio\ntransmissions.\n\n\u201cWe downlinked about 10 minutes of duplicated spacecraft data during a pass on\nApril 8,\u201d Meera Srinivasan, the project\u2019s operations lead at NASA\u2019s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL), said in a statement. \u201cUntil then, we\u2019d been\nsending test and diagnostic data in our downlinks from Psyche. This represents\na significant milestone for the project by showing how optical communications\ncan interface with a spacecraft\u2019s radio frequency comms system.\u201d\n\nRelative positions of the inner planets and Psyche when the data was sent.\n\nImage Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nPrevious tests had the spacecraft much closer \u2013 just tens of millions of\nkilometers away. Images and even a cat video were sent back from deep space.\nThe technology continues to show promise but there are still a few problems\nthat need to be ironed out. For example, optical observations are stopped by\nclouds. Radio communications do not suffer from this issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a great deal about how far we can push the system when we do\nhave clear skies, although storms have interrupted operations at both Table\nMountain and Palomar on occasion,\u201d said Ryan Rogalin, the project\u2019s receiver\nelectronics lead at JPL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team will test the system again in June when Psyche will be at 2.5 times\nthe distance Earth is from the Sun. This is the maximum distance between Mars\nand Earth, and if the approach works, then it is possible to create a data-\nintensive network between Earth and Mars.\n\n### ARTICLE POSTED IN\n\nSpace and PhysicsAstronomy\n\n  * nasa,\n\n  * communication,\n\n  * lasers,\n\n  * optics,\n\n  * Astronomy,\n\n  * laser beams,\n\n  * Psyche,\n\n  * photonics\n\nFOLLOW ONNEWS\n\n## More Space and Physics Stories\n\nWhy Is Mercury Liquid At Room Temperature And Other Metals Aren\u2019t?\n\nchemistry\n\n### Why Is Mercury Liquid At Room Temperature And Other Metals Aren\u2019t?\n\nYesterday\n\n4\n\n150\n\nStarless Rogue Planet As Heavy As 10 Earths Found By NASA Telescope\n\nAstronomy\n\n### Starless Rogue Planet As Heavy As 10 Earths Found By NASA Telescope\n\nYesterday\n\n7\n\n250\n\nNASA Engineer Claims Major Discovery Of New Force In Physics, But Many Aren't\nConvinced\n\nphysics\n\n### NASA Engineer Claims Major Discovery Of New Force In Physics, But Many\nAren't Convinced\n\nYesterday\n\n14\n\n470\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### SPONSORED CONTENT\n\n  1.
