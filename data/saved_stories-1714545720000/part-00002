It is surrounded to the north by forest and\nrugged cliffs, and to the south by the expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. I went\nto this charming city as part of a journey to see some bird species I had not\nseen before, and hopefully get a good photo or two. Hopefully.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## The Quest\n\nYes, it\u2019s another one of my quests for birds! This time, I have a number in\nmind: 700. For weeks, my \u201clife list\u201d of different bird species that I\u2019ve\nphotographed has sat at 699. Just one more new species, and I\u2019ll reach lucky\nnumber 700.\n\nWho cares about a number? Well, I suppose I do a little. But what really\nmatters is being out there, being next to a beautiful bird, and pressing the\nshutter. Click, my mind goes blank, and I cease to exist.\n\nBird #699 is the Cobalt-Rumped Parrotlet / Tuim. Nikon Z6 + 500PF @ ISO 640,\n1/1000, f/5.6\n\nBut this time, I\u2019m nervous. Can I get to 700 species on my trip to Paraty? I\nthink so. Can I get any good shots? Now, that is the question. For one week,\nI\u2019ll be deep in the dark rainforest hunting for birds, without using any bird-\nfeeding or call-playback. Whenever possible, I prefer to photograph birds with\na minimum of interference.\n\nFor an instant, my mind wanders two years back to my trip to Arizona. Immersed\nin the cacti and the ocotillo with clear views for miles, great shots of birds\nfelt guaranteed. But this is the humid rainforest of Brazil, where a bird can\nbe right next to you and you might never know it \u2013 or even if you see it, the\nlight may be too low.\n\n## Bird Species #700\n\nIt\u2019s Sunday, and my wife and I are on the road to Paraty. There\u2019s no time for\nany thinking, except on the topic of how not to make a wrong turn and get lost\nin the depths of Brazil, never to be found again. And I better pay attention\nto the winding road that leads down the coast. It\u2019s steeper and more twisted\nthan anything I\u2019ve seen, and it\u2019s got free road service for the broken down\ncars that appear every few hundred meters. I better remember to double-clutch\nto second on the way back.\n\nThis time, the destination is the coastal city of Paraty. Nikon Z6 + Nikon\n50mm f/1.8G @ 50mm, ISO 100, 1/400, f/10.0\n\nFinally, we arrive at the first beach parking lot. Before I can even take one\nbite of a melting protein bar, something flies into the tree directly\noverhead... the Green-Backed Trogon! A pretty pair perches in the tree for a\nfew minutes. The background is a bit busy, but it\u2019s a worthy #700.\n\nBird #700, the Green-Backed Trogon. NIKON D500 @ 500mm, ISO 640, 1/50, f/5.6\n\nThen, at the beach, the sand is crisp and the ocean is beautiful. Even though\nit\u2019s winter in Brazil, it is as hot as any summer\u2019s day. I get the feeling of\nadventure, knowing that there are fascinating species ready to be found.\n\n## Of Sand and Forests\n\nThe center of Paraty has a mangrove and a mudflat. During low tide, people\nwalk out for hundreds of meters into the salty bay. Combine that with free\nparking before 8 AM and soft morning light, and it feels like conditions are\nright for birding.\n\nI\u2019m thinking, surely there will be a few shorebirds? But I\u2019m surprised to see\nBlack Vultures right in the center of the mudflat. They seem peaceful, and\nthey\u2019re staring out into the sea, knowing that they will receive a guaranteed\nmeal from the local trash cans.\n\nThe hilly islands in the distance are blue with haze, but I\u2019m loving this haze\nas it creates the softest, powdery background. I use my camera\u2019s flip-out rear\nscreen for low shots. I really enjoy the look of the Vulture.\n\nBlack Vulture / urubu-preto. NIKON Z6 + 500PF @ ISO 1600, 1/320, f/5.6\n\nNot far off, I see a few shorebirds: Semipalmated Plovers and a pair of Ruddy\nTurnstones. A lone Magnificent Frigatebird hovers above while Kelp Gulls glide\nacross the sky and Snowy Egrets are moving in their frantic way. Those Snowys\nnever stop moving, unlike the more solemn Great Egret I see that stands in\nwatch, backlit against the golden waves. No detail, no problem!\n\nGreat Egret / gar\u00e7a-branca-grande. Nikon Z6 + 500PF @ ISO 100, 1/8000, f/5.6\n\nCompared to the upcoming rainforest, the light here is plentiful and smooth. I\nstand on the mudflat, and I\u2019m hit by the sun rising in the distance, so I try\nsome spur-of-the-moment landscape photography.\n\nUnlike many mountains I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019m intrigued by how fast the fog and clouds\nmove throughout the peaks and forests here. Sometimes, the scene changes\ndrastically in a couple seconds, giving endless variations of color. I\u2019ve\nlimited my gear on this trip, so I only shoot with two focal lengths: 50mm and\n500mm on the Z6 and D500. Those will have to do. Long landscapes it is.\n\nNIKON D500 @ 500mm, ISO 100, 1/640, f/5.6\n\nLater, we drive to the Fazenda Bananal, a local farm that grows all the\nproduce used at its restaurant. I made a mistake: It opens at ten, but we\u2019re\nhere at nine. No matter, there\u2019s a deserted road that leads into the forest.\nCould there be birds there?\n\nYes, it\u2019s great for birds, but it\u2019s the darkest forest I\u2019ve ever seen, and I\ncan barely get a shot. Because the birds come close to the path, I am wishing\nI had a 300mm f/2.8 instead of my 500mm f/5.6! The bananas growing overhead\nare too high to reach as well. Ah, I\u2019m getting hungry. At least now it\u2019s time\nfor the Bananal.\n\nThe only hope to get a bit more light is to wait for a bird to land a little\nhigher up. Robust Woodpecker / pica-pau-rei. Nikon D500 + 500PF @ ISO 1600,\n1/500, f/5.6\n\nAfter lunch, a boardwalk trail leads into the dark forest. It\u2019s only slightly\nbetter than the road, with my ISOs climbing to 12,800 even though the sun is\nhigh in the sky! Yet, the birds are bold, coming to the forest edges and even\neating right next to the path. I try some longer shutter speeds to keep the\nnoise under control.\n\nSometimes, the forest goes silent, and then in a slight clearing, there\u2019s an\nexplosion of colorful tanagers. Brazil has about twenty species of Tanagers,\nand most of them are quite colorful. My mind feels saturated and filled with\nthe calls darting overhead, and my neck is strained. I can\u2019t always get them,\nas they move so fast. But even if I miss them, I love watching them move\naround.\n\nGreen-headed Tanager / sa\u00edra-sete-cores, Nikon D500 + 500PF @ ISO 7200, 1/800,\nf/5.6\n\n## Winding Down\n\nThe days are passing quickly, and it\u2019s almost time to go back home. It\u2019s the\nlast time on the trail and I\u2019m not sure I got a single good shot today, at\nleast of birds. But now there\u2019s movement to the right: it\u2019s a troop of Common\nMarmosets! They\u2019re eating bananas, and there are one or two carrying a baby.\nThe baby marmoset clings so tight that it\u2019s not always easy to see.\n\nCommon Marmoset and baby / sagui-de-tufo-branco. Nikon D500 + 500PF @ ISO\n1400, 1/80, f/5.6\n\nThat night, I look forward to dinner. Bird photography does make me very\nhungry. As I start making it, I hear my wife shout, \u201cgrab your camera!\u201d I\ndon\u2019t hesitate because my wife has \u201cthe eye,\u201d which means she has a talent for\nspotting rare birds, and this time she\u2019s found a Tiger Heron.\n\nIt\u2019s Rufescent Tiger Heron, right? But where\u2019s the rufous? No, I verify in the\nbook later that it\u2019s a much rarer species, the Fasciated Tiger Heron, not seen\nin this location in over a year! I\u2019m not thinking of identification, though,\nas I run down as quietly as I can to photograph it perched on a rock. It flies\naway... but just to another rock not far away! Yes, that\u2019s not bad at all.\n\nFasciated Tiger-Heron / soc\u00f3-jararaca. Nikon D500 + 500PF @ ISO 1250, 1/320,\nf/5.6\n\nThe next day, on our way back, it\u2019s time for one last visit to the beach \u2013\nparked at the same spot where I saw the famous \u201cbird #700\u201d on my life list. I\nlook up at the same tree to see if another Trogon is there, but the trees are\ndevoid of birds this time. Yet I spot something at the edge of the waves,\nskittering over the sand. It\u2019s the Semipalmated Plover!\n\nI get closer. It\u2019s hard to believe, but the little Plover goes right up to the\nedge of the ocean, running as fast as it can whenever the waves come in. Its\nlittle legs seem just enough to keep it only inches ahead of the wave. After\nthe waves recede, it goes right back and starts the game all over again,\nrunning just ahead of the wave. Yes, it might be a strategy for looking for\nfood, but it looks a lot like it\u2019s having a fun, too! What a nice way to say\ngoodbye.\n\nSemipalmated Plover / batu\u00edra-de-bando. Nikon D500 + 500PF @ ISO 100, 1/4000,\nf/5.6\n\n## Looking Back\n\nWhen I get home, it\u2019s finally time to go through the photos \u2013 some from the Z6\nand some from my even older D500, which probably will be replaced quite soon,\nbut which has worked flawlessly as usual.\n\nLooking back as I delete most of them, I\u2019m struck by one thing: how\nsurprisingly difficult bird photography has been here. With one of the\nthickest forests I\u2019ve seen in my life, there were so many obstacles: branches\nin the way, hardly enough light, light too harsh, bird too high, bird too low,\nand even bird too close. Yet, after some work, I like the results. I told\nmyself before the trip that I\u2019d be happy with a couple decent shots for the\nweek, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\n\nWhen I\u2019m going through my old shots, I sometimes think bird photography isn\u2019t\nso hard. It only takes one trip out in the field to bring me back to the real\nworld. Even so, I can\u2019t wait for the next one.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n  * Birds of Capara\u00f3\n\n  * Photographing Birds and Insects Presentation\n\n  * Photographing Exotic Birds Close to Home\n\n  * Photographing Water Birds in Winter\n\n  * Raptor Photography Techniques\n\n  * Photographing Birds in Motion at 60fps\n\nDisclosures, Terms and Conditions and Support Options\n\nFiled Under: Essays and Inspiration Tagged With: Bird Photography, Essays,\nTravel, Travel Photography\n\n#### About Jason Polak\n\nJason Polak is a bird and wildlife photographer from Ottawa, Canada.

After this trip, what number are you up to now?\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nRobert John\n\nApril 30, 2024 11:44 am\n\nWhat will you \u2018replace\u2019 your D500 with? I ask because I\u2019m debating whether to\nreplace my D7500 with one while they are, just about, still around. At \u00a3800\nfor a good used one, it seems a good bet against the \u00a32,500 Nikon will want\nfor a Z6iii. (I could also upgrade my 300f4D to a PF to go with my 500/f5.6\nPF. I don\u2019t see Z-mount beating those, rather excellent, lenses. \u00a33,600 is a\nlot to pay for a 400/f4.5 and 1.4 TC. I also have a Z5. I quite like its wide\narea AF for birds in flight (and running dogs) and, frame rate apart, I\u2019m not\naware that the Z6ii actually outperforms it. I\u2019d say the AF on my D7500 beats\nthe Z5 (again, ignoring frame rate). The Z5 scores very well for landscapes\nwith the 14-30 and 24-200 being a very transportable combo. As you will\ngather, I\u2019m not in the market for a Z8. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s superb, but it\u2019s\nexpensive. And I don\u2019t need 45mp, but I do want 20+mp at 750mm. I don\u2019t do\nvideo. Would a D500 be the right bet? Or do you think the Z6iii will seriously\nout-perform it, including in dx mode / with a TC?\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nElaine Lansdown\n\nReply to Robert John\n\nApril 30, 2024 12:48 pm\n\nI don\u2019t understand why the D500 is considered obsolete. It is a great camera.\nI bought one just before Nikon retired it a year or so ago while I could still\nget a new one, and I love using it. I have its grandparent, the D300s, that I\nhated every moment that I used it. They did so many improvements to the D500,\nthat you wouldn\u2019t think it came from the same line. It has the best shutter\nthat I\u2019ve ever used. If you want an aps-c camera and don\u2019t care about the z vs\ndslr thing, I believe you can\u2019t go wrong with the D500.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nElaine Lansdown\n\nApril 30, 2024 11:23 am\n\nHi Jason, This article for me is by far the best one you\u2019ve written. I enjoyed\nit from beginning to end. I love the photos. I think they are truly\nmagnificent portraits of these birds. I especially love the one of the\nsemipalmated plover. Everything about that photo is beautiful. As a person who\nloves to photograph birds with almost no opportunity to do so, I love looking\nat your photos. Well done!\n\n0\n\nReply\n\n#### Learn\n\n  * Beginner Photography\n  * Landscape Photography\n  * Wildlife Photography\n  * Portraiture\n  * Post-Processing\n  * Advanced Tutorials\n\n#### Reviews\n\n  * Camera Reviews\n  * Lens Reviews\n  * Other Gear Reviews\n  * Best Cameras and Lenses\n\n#### Photography Tutorials\n\nPhotography Basics\n\nLandscape Photography\n\nWildlife Photography\n\nMacro Photography\n\nComposition & Creativity\n\nBlack & White Photography\n\nNight Sky Photography\n\nPortrait Photography\n\nStreet Photography\n\nPhotography Videos\n\n#### Unique Gift Ideas\n\n#### Subscribe via Email\n\nIf you like our content, you can subscribe to our newsletter to receive weekly\nemail updates using the link below:\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n#### Site Menu\n\n  * About Us\n  * Beginner Photography\n  * Lens Database\n  * Lens Index\n  * Photo Spots\n  * Search\n  * Forum\n\n#### Reviews\n\n  * Reviews Archive\n  * Camera Reviews\n  * Lens Reviews\n  * Other Gear Reviews\n\n#### More\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Subscribe\n  * Workshops\n  * Support Us\n  * Submit Content\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 \u00b7 Photography Life\n\n", "frontpage": false}
