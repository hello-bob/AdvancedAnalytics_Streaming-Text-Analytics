They motivate us to go places that we would never\notherwise go. They are needed both to change organizations and to produce\nresults. In any business climate, good leadership is perhaps the most\nimportant competitive advantage a company can have. It\u2019s hardly surprising,\ntherefore, that management scholars focus relentlessly on the attributes of\nsuccessful leadership.\n\nBut in our understandable effort to grasp and master the skills of leadership,\nwe tend to lose sight of the fact that there are two parts to the leadership\nequation. For leaders to lead, they need not only exceptional talent but also\nthe ability to attract followers. Regrettably, however, it\u2019s becoming harder\nto get people to follow. The problem is that followers get short shrift in the\nmanagement literature, where they are described largely in terms of their\nleaders\u2019 qualities. In other words, they\u2019re thought of as merely responding to\na leader\u2019s charisma or caring attitude. What most analyses seem to ignore,\nthough, is that followers have their own identity. Indeed, in 30 years of\nexperience as a psychoanalyst, anthropologist, and management consultant, I\nhave found that followers are as powerfully driven to follow as leaders are to\nlead.\n\nFollowers\u2019 motivations fall into two categories\u2014rational and irrational. The\nrational ones are conscious and therefore well-known. They have to do with our\nhopes of gaining money, status, power, or entry into a meaningful enterprise\nby following a great leader\u2014and our fears that we will miss out if we don\u2019t.\nMore influential, much of the time, are the irrational motivations that lie\noutside the realm of our awareness and, therefore, beyond our ability to\ncontrol them. For the most part, these motivations arise from the powerful\nimages and emotions in our unconscious that we project onto our relationships\nwith leaders.\n\nSigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, was the first person to provide\nsome explanation of how a follower\u2019s unconscious motivations work. After\npracticing psychoanalysis for a number of years, Freud was puzzled to find\nthat his patients\u2014who were, in a sense, his followers\u2014kept falling in love\nwith him. Although most of his patients were women, the same thing happened\nwith his male patients. It is a great tribute to Freud that he realized that\nhis patients\u2019 idealization of him couldn\u2019t be traced to his own personal\nqualities. Instead, he concluded, people were relating to him as if he were\nsome important person from their past\u2014usually a parent. In undergoing\ntherapy\u2014or in falling in love, for that matter\u2014people were transferring\nexperiences and emotions from past relationships onto the present. Freud\nthought the phenomenon was universal. He wrote, \u201cThere is no love that does\nnot reproduce infantile stereotypes,\u201d which, for him, explained why so many of\nus choose spouses like our parents.\n\nFreud called the dynamic \u201ctransference,\u201d and it was one of his great\ndiscoveries. Indeed, for Freud, patients were ready to end therapy when they\nunderstood and mastered their transference. But even today, identifying and\ndissolving transferences are the principal goals of psychoanalysis.\n\nBut as important as it is, the concept remains little understood outside\nclinical psychoanalysis. This is unfortunate, because transference is not just\nthe missing link in theories of leadership\u2014it also explains a lot about the\neveryday behavior of organizations. A number of studies have shown, for\nexample, that positive transferences are closely linked to productivity.\nSuppose an employee believes that her boss will care about her in a parental\nway. To ensure that this happens, she will make superhuman efforts to please\nher leader. As long as she perceives that these transferred expectations are\nbeing met, she will continue to work hard, to the obvious benefit of the\norganization as a whole.\n\nThe trouble is, not all transferences are positive. A worker might see his\nboss as someone he has to fight. And even if transference works well for a\nwhile, it can change quite suddenly if the employee\u2019s transferential\nexpectations are not met. Consider Sylvia Hartman^1, a marketing manager in an\nEast Coast market research and advertising company. Hartman was a creative but\nvolatile employee who worked for Sam Phillips, a divisional vice president.\nPhillips took Hartman under his wing, and she soon came to value him as a\nmentor and friend. When a job that would have been a major promotion for\nHartman opened up, she fully expected to get it. Instead, Phillips chose Harry\nJohnson, a move that devastated Hartman. She believed that she was vastly more\nintelligent than Johnson and had assumed that would be the primary basis for\nthe promotion decision. However, Phillips said that he found Johnson to be\nmore dependable and to have better people skills. When Hartman heard this\nexplanation\u2014and that Johnson would become her manager\u2014she exploded in a\ndestructive rage. She responded to her new boss by utterly ignoring his\ne-mails and phone calls, and she refused point blank to be supervised by him.\nSeeing the rift between his two players, Phillips thought about firing\nHartman.\n\nIn doing psychoanalysis with Hartman, I found out that her rage was deeply\nrooted in her childhood. The eldest of five children, Hartman badly wanted to\nbe her father\u2019s favorite. Hartman\u2019s father was a very successful executive,\nbut he constantly disappointed her. Over and over again, he showed that he\npreferred one of her brothers to her, even though, in her view, the brother\nwasn\u2019t as smart as she was. Being passed over by Phillips evoked deep\nresentment in Hartman; it reopened a wound that had never healed. Hartman\u2019s\ntransference of feelings from childhood to the workplace was unproductive. She\ncould be a good \u201cfollower\u201d to her boss only when she felt she was the favorite\nchild. Unless she recognized her projections and worked them through, Hartman\nwould be in danger of losing her job.\n\nIn consulting with companies as diverse as Volvo, AT&T, IBM, and ABB, I have\nseen countless cases like Hartman\u2019s. But companies that might once have put up\nwith this kind of leader-follower relationship cannot afford that luxury\ntoday. Transferences no longer necessarily work in leaders\u2019 favor, because to\na large extent, the changing structures of families\u2014more single-parent homes,\ndual working parents, and so on\u2014have begun to create work environments where\npeople value traditional leaders less. So it\u2019s time that leaders take the\ntransference phenomenon seriously, learn how to mitigate its effects, and even\nmanage it to the organization\u2019s advantage. In the following pages, I will\nexplore the most common types of transference, showing how they can play out\nin the workplace and how they are evolving as the dynamics of family life\nchange. Let\u2019s begin by examining the concept and dynamics of transference in\nmore detail.\n\n## The Fantasy and the Facts\n\nAt its best, transference is the emotional glue that binds people to a leader.\nEmployees in the grip of positive transference see their leader as better than\nshe really is\u2014smarter, nicer, more charismatic. They tend to give that person\nthe benefit of the doubt and take on more risk at her request than they\notherwise would. And as long as the leader\u2019s reality is not too far from the\nfollowers\u2019 idealization\u2014and she doesn\u2019t start to believe in their idealized\nimage of her\u2014this works very well.\n\nBut without a strong grounding in reality, leaders can very easily come undone\nby their followers\u2019 positive transferential projections. At the extreme, such\nfollowers will create a myth that bears no relation to fact. A classic study\nof this dynamic is the movie Being There. In the film, Peter Sellers plays\nChance the gardener, a simple man with little knowledge of the world beyond\ngardening. When his wealthy employer dies, Chance finds himself by\nhappenstance socializing in the circles of the rich and famous. He behaves as\nhe always has done, sharing his facile thoughts without considering their\neffect on those around him. But his new acquaintances start reading profound\nmetaphors about politics and economics into his throwaway comments about\ngardening. By the end of the film, Chance is being touted as a U.S.\npresidential hopeful. Although few good leaders are so unaware of their impact\nthat they will allow their relationship with followers to become this\nunrealistic, it\u2019s remarkable how often even reasonably self-aware leaders will\nbecome victims of illusion.\n\nMost good leaders don\u2019t buy into their followers\u2019 idealized images of them.\nBut even leaders who are reasonably self-aware can become victims of illusion.\n\nThe transference dynamic is most likely to get out of control during periods\nof organizational stress. In such situations, followers tend to be more\ndominated by irrational feelings\u2014in particular, the need for praise and\nprotection from all-powerful parents. At the same time, the leader is\npreoccupied with handling the crisis at hand and, as a consequence, is\nprobably less alert to the likelihood that his followers are just acting out\nchildhood fears. This is what happened to a vice president of AT&T I was\nadvising in the mid-1980s, during the breakup of the Bell System. While he was\nfocusing on strategy, his followers felt frustrated that he was not dealing\nwith their anxiety and reassuring them. Even though he was charting a\npromising new course for his division, employees complained that he wasn\u2019t\nleading them.\n\nAnother example of how transference is triggered by doubt and stress is the\nway people feel better just going to see a doctor, even before the doctor has\ndone anything for them. In large measure, this phenomenon can be explained by\npatients\u2019 trust, which transfers the childhood experience of being cared for\nby parents when sick. This type of transference makes it extremely hard for\nscientists to evaluate certain medications, such as mood-altering drugs.\nClinical studies show, for example, that up to 30% of people respond as well\nto placebos\u2014again, trust\u2014as to antidepressants. People who volunteer for a\nstudy in hopes of finding a cure to their ailment may be especially receptive\nto placebos.\n\nAs well as being quite subtle in its workings, transference comes in many\nguises. It is blind to both age and gender, so stereotyping is very dangerous.\nA male leader, therefore, should never assume that he is a father figure or a\nbrother figure\u2014nor should a female leader assume she\u2019s a mother or a sister.\nPsychoanalysis has clearly shown that someone can have a paternal transference\nwith a woman in authority and a maternal transference with a man.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the images we project from childhood are shaped by the family\ncultures we grew up with, a fact of particular importance today because more\npeople now have family experiences that differ\u2014sometimes quite radically\u2014from\nwhat was long considered the norm. Indeed, I\u2019ve noticed that for an increasing\nnumber of people, the significant person from the past is not a parent but a\nsibling, a close childhood friend, or even a nanny. Organizations are\nadjusting to the times, moving from hierarchies that worked well with parent-\nfocused employees to more-horizontal setups that suit people who relate better\nto near equals. As we\u2019ll discuss later, the shift from parental to sibling\ntransferences can fit organizations\u2019 needs for boundary-crossing project teams\nand networks. When managers at Boeing sought a leader for a software team that\nrequired a lot of interactivity among members, for instance, they joked about\nfinding someone who was the fifth child in a family of ten siblings, someone\nwho was used to mediating among brothers and sisters. In other words, the job\ncalled for a different kind of leadership than the traditional hierarchical\nboss would provide. Sibling leaders have to facilitate problem solving and\nbuild consensus.\n\nAnother complicating factor is that people can have multiple transferential\nrelationships in an organization. It seems very likely to me that at General\nElectric over the past two decades, many employees not only had such\nrelationships with their immediate bosses but also transferred childhood\nfeelings onto Jack Welch, even though they had never met him. In cases of\nmultiple transferences, both the immediate boss and the CEO might be seen as\nfather figures. But when this happens, the employee usually experiences the\ntransferences differently. Typically he will relate to his immediate boss from\nthe perspective of a child who is four, five, or even older. But he will\nregard the CEO as a baby would see an earlier father figure, who is distant,\nprotective, and all knowing.\n\nPerhaps the biggest risk in transference comes from the fact that it is always\na two-way street. Just as a follower projects his past experiences onto his\nleader, the leader responds by projecting her past experiences back onto the\nfollower. Freud called this phenomenon countertransference and saw it as one\nof the most serious obstacles to resolving patients\u2019 psychological issues. The\ndanger was that a psychoanalyst would respond to a patient\u2019s transferential\nprotestations of love by accepting that love as real. As a result, the analyst\nmight assume the role of a protective parent, furthering the patient\u2019s\ndependency. Or the analysis might end in a love affair rather than a cure.\nCountertransference is at least as big a problem for business leaders as for\npsychoanalysts. In his novel Disclosure, Michael Crichton describes how a\nruthless and dishonest woman is promoted above a more-qualified man because\nshe reminds the CEO of a favorite daughter who was killed in an auto accident.\nThe CEO does not see her as she is but responds to her as though she were his\nbeloved daughter.\n\nOn the one hand, transference is a facilitator of followership and therefore a\nsource of strength for leaders; on the other hand, it is a real threat to\nleaders because it destroys objectivity. This is why, as we\u2019ll see, a good CEO\nwill try to understand transference and will work hard to help his executive\nteam members see one another as they really are. The future of the company may\ndepend upon his ability to do so. It\u2019s worth taking time, therefore, to\nexamine the most common types of transference.\n\n## In the Name of the Father\n\nThe type of transference that Freud observed for the first time was paternal\ntransference, in which patients experienced unconditional love for the analyst\nas a wise, understanding, protective father. In such relationships with Freud,\npatients slavishly gave up their own views and embraced his as unquestionably\ncorrect. Paternal transference has been so prevalent in traditional\ncorporations that it has been considered normal behavior. In organizational\nsurveys, people invariably describe their immediate boss in positive terms,\neven when they express distrust in top management. Indeed, the hierarchical\nstructure of traditional organizations has reinforced paternal transference.\nAt every level in a hierarchy, individuals have a boss who doles out\nassignments and rewards. This creates in followers a willingness to obey\norders\u2014as well as an overvaluation of the boss and a strengthening of\ninfantile wishes to be loved and protected.\n\nMy research shows that workers in paternalistically structured businesses\ntypically see their boss from the perspective of a five-year-old boy who\nbelieves that \u201cfather knows best.\u201d Of course, even back in the 1970s, when I\nwrote a book on organizations called The Gamesman, different types of paternal\ntransference could be found in business. Some people looked to their bosses as\nmentors, the kind of dads who introduced their sons to games and sports;\nothers saw their bosses as demanding fathers whose approval was rarely (if\never) given. Perhaps the ideal paternal boss was the pipe-smoking, one-minute\nmanager, the daddy figure who dispensed small doses of encouragement,\napproval, or constructive criticism, as needed.\n\n#### The Different Faces of Transference\n\nWhen I was a consultant to ABB in the 1990s, I was asked to interview managers\nin Asia, Europe, and North America. My ...\n\nWhatever role followers project onto their leaders, most male CEOs in\ntraditional organizations have consciously or unconsciously encouraged\npaternal transferences. They tend to show themselves in paternalistic\nsettings\u2014presiding over large meetings or smiling on videotapes\u2014where the\nmessage is invariably reassuring, upbeat, hopeful. Even when times are bad,\nthese leaders assure their followers that the downturn is temporary. The\nmessage is always the same: \u201cTrust me to steer you through these troubled\nwaters.\u201d\n\nCEOs in traditional organizations tend to show themselves in paternalistic\nsettings, presiding over large meetings or smiling on videotapes.\n\nSome companies go a great distance to promote paternal transference. In the\nearly 1970s, when I worked with managers at IBM, they told me that the company\nhad a strict rule against teams and against shared decision making. The rule\nhad come directly from the legendary CEO Tom Watson, Sr., and it had the\neffect of forging a direct link between employees and their bosses. Whether he\nwas aware of it or not, Watson was sanctioning paternal transference at IBM.\nIt was further reinforced by the company\u2019s paternalistic commitment to\nemployees that good performance ensured lifetime employment.\n\nI saw similar dynamics at work when I was a consultant to the executive team\nof AT&T Communications during the 1980s. Most of the vice presidents there\nwere uncritically worshipful of their business unit presidents and the several\nCEOs who were making disastrous strategy moves\u2014giving up cellular telephony,\nfor instance, and losing billions in an effort to compete in computers.\nInstead of encouraging healthy debate about the future of the company, bosses\nexpected\u2014and rewarded\u2014transferential veneration. I clearly remember one vice\npresident who stuck out because he didn\u2019t comply with this company culture.\nAlthough his division produced the best results within the long-distance\nbusiness unit, the executive team didn\u2019t appreciate him. This was not only\nbecause his realistic attitude toward his business unit\u2019s president was\nfraught with implicit criticism of other vice presidents\u2019 transferential\novervaluation of the leader; it was also because he was an unconventional\nmanager for AT&T at that time. Unlike the others, he delegated responsibility,\ndidn\u2019t need to take credit for his division\u2019s successes, and initiated new\nbusinesses. Ultimately, he took early retirement, frustrated by his inability\nto push his ideas through the bureaucracy.\n\nIn this sort of environment, followers can find their trust in a benevolent\nleader to be sadly misplaced. Consider Eric Edwards, 27 years old and an\nexecutive assistant to the CEO of a prestigious international company. When he\nleft this high-potential job, his colleagues and boss were extremely puzzled.\nHe was taking a position at a lower salary with a much smaller company. And he\ndidn\u2019t get stock options.\n\nWhen asked why he was leaving, Edwards said he wanted to work with Ed Carey, a\nperson he believed could teach him a great deal. He felt he shared a deep\nsense of mission with this older man, who had in the past gained considerable\npublicity for his innovations. At first, the work with Carey was productive\nand exciting, and Edwards basked in the credit Carey shared with him. But\nCarey had to be the innovator, the author of all the new ideas. He gave\nEdwards the role of implementer and invariably shot down or ignored Edwards\u2019s\nown ideas. It took five years of psychoanalysis before Edwards\u2014who came from a\ntraditional family\u2014could realize that his attachment to Carey was\ntransferential. As Edwards came to see, he initially had felt the same kind of\nsupport from Carey that he had once received from his father. Only when he saw\nthat his boss did not treat him as a favored son but rather as a servant did\nEdwards seek to free himself. He told me that he\u2019d learned a lot the first\ncouple of years with Carey, but subsequent years on the job had been a waste\nof time.\n\nFor better or for worse, traditional paternal transference can create more\nloyal followers than any of the other forms of transference\u2014in large part,\nbecause it tends to be a stable form of projection. Indeed, some of our best\nleaders are masters of manipulating the paternal transference of their\nfollowers. Movie director Francis Ford Coppola, for example, creates a family\nout of his cast members, who address him as \u201cPapa\u201d or \u201cGodfather.\u201d Steven\nSpielberg\u2019s creative team calls him \u201cRabbi,\u201d which means \u201cteacher.\u201d Both of\nthese directors use the worshipful feelings of their casts and crews to pull\nout the dramatic performances that have resulted in some of the best films\never produced.\n\n## And of the Mother\n\nMaternal transference differs from paternal transference in that it usually\ndraws on an earlier childhood relationship. Unlike the father, who is often\nperceived as distant and detached, and whose approval is dependent on\nperformance, the mother is often seen both as an authority figure and as a\ngiver of unconditional love. She is the protective figure who gives us life\nand showers us with support, but she is also the first person who says no. It\nis the mother who weans us and, for the most part, who toilet trains us. Later\nit is she who separates herself from us to go back to work or to move on to\nother children. Not surprisingly, she is represented by both the fairy\ngodmother and the evil stepmother in children\u2019s stories. She is both deity and\nwitch, and this deep divide in our psyches can play itself out to dramatic\neffect in business situations. One only has to look at the public\u2019s extreme\nreactions of love and hate toward Martha Stewart to realize that women leaders\nstir up some of the most conflicted feelings we have in our unconscious.\n\nTake, for instance, Jill Fisher and Allison Warren. Fisher, age 35, was vice\npresident of the graphic design company founded by Warren, age 55. Both were\ncreative and emotionally reactive. Warren was a mother figure whom Fisher\ncounted on for unconditional love and support. When Warren felt that Fisher\nwas sucking her dry, she withdrew emotionally, causing Fisher pain and\nconfusion. Fisher felt like an adolescent who resents her mother because she\nstill needs her. So any spark of disagreement could fire Fisher\u2019s anger, and\nthe two would start screaming at each other. These confrontations caused\nWarren to take tranquilizers for anxiety attacks. Later, Fisher would abjectly\napologize, and there would be mutual protestations of love. Of course, this\nwas hard on Warren and upsetting to the other employees, who were sometimes\nbrought into these transferential dramas.\n\nWarren isn\u2019t the only strong woman to have a hard time of it in business.\nThink of Sherry Lansing, president of Paramount. Lansing is an ex-actress who,\nbesides being beautiful, is brilliant and tall. She towers over the male\nsubordinates she uses to convey bad news to movie hopefuls. In essence, she\u2019s\ntaken on the role of Snow White to avoid being seen as the wicked witch. Even\nso, her underlings refer to her both as a goddess and as an ice queen. Tina\nBrown encountered similar ambivalence when she was the editor of the New\nYorker. Followers often have a hard time dealing with strong women precisely\nbecause they stimulate in subordinates the feelings of awe and fear that the\nmother once did. Children depend on the help and support of the all-powerful\nmother. They also want her to be happy and proud of them, and they feel deep\nguilt if they cause her suffering\u2014a fact that some mothers use to control\ntheir kids. Beneath the guilt is the unconscious fear that the mother will cut\noff her life-giving nurturance.\n\nMaternal transferences generate greater expectations of empathy and tenderness\nfrom bosses than can realistically be met. Usually a boss\u2019s approval is more\ncontingent, as it should be, on an employee\u2019s performance than on warm\nfeelings. A colleague of mine saw this when he coached the 40-year-old vice\npresident of a home-building company, who was told in no uncertain terms by\nthe president that he had handed in a bad proposal. The VP complained that the\npresident should have shown more emotional intelligence in rejecting the\nproposal. When the president dismissed this complaint as \u201cpsychobabble,\u201d the\nVP grew irate. As my colleague immediately realized, the VP was projecting an\ninappropriate maternal transference. When the company\u2019s president didn\u2019t\nrespond as the VP wanted, the VP reacted like a rejected child.\n\nPositive maternal transferences can give people a powerful sense of support.\nThink of Ronald Reagan, whose wife, Nancy, was like a protective tigress\nduring and after his presidency; he called her \u201cMommy.\u201d Although his father\nwas a failed shoe salesman, Reagan\u2019s own strong mother was a major reason for\nhis self-confidence and success. However, even positive maternal transferences\ncan have bad effects. A close friend of mine taught for 18 years in a private\nschool where most teachers had a maternal transference with the headmistress,\nwho created a family-like culture. The teachers loved their boss and felt\ncared for and protected by her, but the warm feelings they had were not a good\nmeasure of her ability to perform. As she neared retirement, the school was in\nthe red, and it became clear that the headmistress had done little either to\nevaluate and develop the teachers or to help them deal with discipline\nproblems. While her successor was less comforting and more demanding, he\nsucceeded in raising money from rich parents, improving teachers\u2019 salaries,\nand establishing rules that were followed.\n\nMaternal transferences can sometimes be quite subversive of the formal\norganization even as they facilitate results. In one software company a\ncolleague of mine consulted at, a number of male executives had a positive\nmaternal transference with a woman coworker. She was the person they went to\nwith their problems. These men were extremely competitive, but they were very\ncomfortable communicating with one another through this woman. As one of the\nmanagers put it, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any hierarchical power, but she sure has\nnetwork power.\u201d She was able to reassure the men that they could trust one\nanother.\n\n## And Increasingly of the Brother\n\nSibling transference is as old as Cain and Abel, who competed for God\u2019s\naffection and attention, and Jacob and Esau, who competed for their father\u2019s.\nBut over the past generation, sibling transferences have become less rivalrous\nand, at the same time, more influential. The rivalry has dissipated since\nchildren, increasingly raised in single-parent households or in families where\nboth parents work, no longer care as much about being their parents\u2019 favorite.\nInstead, many of them develop close relationships at an early age with their\nsiblings or with other kids in day care. As children cannot always rely on\nhard-working parents to be there when needed, they depend more on siblings and\nfriends for emotional support. In fact, rather than trying to get what they\nwant by pleasing their parents, kids learn at an early age to play on parental\nguilt and negotiate for privileges. Increasingly, these attitudes toward\nauthority are being transferred to the workplace, making leadership even more\ndifficult.\n\nIn the course of my research and consulting, I have consistently found that\nthe employees who take most readily to horizontal organizations like cross-\nfunctional and project teams are those who were brought up in nontraditional\nfamilies. Frontline employee Penny Nichols, for instance, a technician in her\nlate twenties whom I met at an AT&T business service center, is comfortable\ninteracting with her peer network. She\u2019s also developed independent\nrelationships with customers\u2014in one case, to the point where she personally\ncontrolled a multimillion-dollar account. This customer invites Nichols to\nconferences and refuses to deal with AT&T managers or account executives. I\nasked Nichols whether she felt comfortable handling this account by herself.\nShe conceded that she did need assistance with some of the data, but her\nfriend Annie Hellwarth from information services helped her out there. And\nwhat about her manager? What was his role? She said she needed his help only\nto get pricing information and to connect with other parts of AT&T when the\ncompany had new products she could offer the customer. But even though Nichols\ndid a good job and was highly motivated, she was not fully qualified to\ndevelop the business relationship with the customer. Popular advice to\nmanagement on empowering employees ignores this sort of problem. Employees\nlike Nichols\u2014who comes from a family where both parents worked and who not\nsurprisingly has transferential ties to coworkers rather than to\nmanagers\u2014function best as players in a game with clear roles, rules, rewards,\nand relations to authority. Otherwise, they tend to ignore authority, which\ncan sometimes lead them to commit the company to bad deals.\n\nIndeed, one consequence of the rise in sibling transference in leadership is\nthat people are becoming increasingly critical of and ambivalent toward their\nbosses. At one company, I saw sibling transferences turn a group of employees\ninto a band of brothers who were rebelling against an autocratic boss/father.\nPeople coming from nontraditional family cultures tend to evaluate bosses in\nterms of their value as leaders, which is very much the way children see team\ncaptains in the school yard. Thus, the newer generation of employees shows\nless interest both in being mentored and in mentoring, and more interest in\ndeveloping reciprocal relations in their networks of peers.\n\nOf course, these kinds of followers are hard to lead, for they often have an\nanarchic ideal of leadership. But their attitudes do fit the needs of the many\ncompanies that are moving away from product-based business models to total-\nsolution strategies. To avoid narrowing profit margins, companies like GE\nEnergy are wrapping products in services that require employees to work\ninterdependently with customers. I consulted for ABB in Canada at a time when\nthe company\u2019s electrical products were becoming commodities. To boost profits,\nwe explored the potential of doing business with large customers like the\nzinc-mining and smelting company Cominco, which proposed partnering with ABB\n(rather than merely buying equipment) to increase energy efficiency and\ndecrease environmental pollution. To pursue this opportunity, ABB had to pull\npeople together from its different business units to work with engineers from\nCominco.\n\nNewer generations of employees are susceptible to sibling transferences. They\nthrive in peer networks but can be hard to lead because they often have an\nanarchic ideal of leadership.\n\nCompanies shifting from selling products to coproducing solutions recognize\nthat they need to move away from traditional hierarchical models. Jay\nGalbraith, a professor at the University of Southern California, has written\nabout this sort of shift at companies such as Nestl\u00e9, Nokia, and Citibank. He\ndescribes it in terms of forming cross-boundary networks that require leaders\nwho can build trusting relationships to facilitate decision making and create\nconsensus. IBM, once the poster child of hierarchy, is taking the lead in this\nchange. The CEO, Sam Palmisano, is trying to move the company away from a pure\nhierarchy as he organizes to integrate technology with business processes. In\nIBM\u2019s latest annual report, Palmisano highlights promising opportunities in\nbusiness transformation outsourcing, \u201cwhich was not even part of the industry\nlexicon 18 months ago.\u201d Implementing IBM\u2019s new strategy will require teams of\ncolleagues from different disciplines who are comfortable working together and\nwilling to shift leadership roles according to who has the appropriate\ncompetence. There can be no clearer sign of the increased importance of\nsibling transferences.\n\nSibling transference has even made its debut in politics with the first baby\nboomer U.S. president, Bill Clinton. People didn\u2019t relate to Clinton as a\nfather\u2014the kind of transference you might have expected with the nation\u2019s\ncommander in chief\u2014but rather as an admired older brother or \u201cbuddy\u201d (as\nClinton named his dog). Although he had his critics, Clinton was never really\nexpected to be a model of good behavior. Unlike Lyndon Johnson, for whom\nAmericans\u2019 positive attitude flipped when their paternal-transferential\nexpectations were shattered, Clinton was allowed to get away with his\nwomanizing because he was perceived by much of the public as merely a naughty\nbrother.\n\n## Making Transference Work for You\n\nIf all relationships are colored by transference, how can you ever know if\nyour followers\u2019 relationships with you are real? The short answer is that you\ncan\u2019t. Even the closest relationships combine objective reality with images\nand emotions carried over from the past, and there will never be any way\naround that. However, your followers\u2019 motivations for following don\u2019t have to\nbe based in reality in order to work. What\u2019s more, there are ways of managing\ntransferences that not only reduce the potential for negative transferences\nbut actually increase the likelihood of positive ones.\n\n#### Managing Transference\n\nIt is impossible to master your followers\u2019 transferences for them. Followers\nneed to do that on their own\u2014and in some ...\n\nIf all relationships are colored by transference, how can you ever know if\nyour followers\u2019 relationships with you are real? You can\u2019t.\n\nA key way that managers can influence their followers\u2019 positive and negative\ntransferences is to acknowledge their own transferences. The classic path to\nself-knowledge is introspection\u2014the approach favored in psychology. The\ntrouble with introspection, of course, is that it can paralyze a leader,\nespecially one with a strong obsessive bent. Endless self-analysis will\nprevent her from making quick decisions. Consequently, many of the most\neffective leaders rely on an outsider to provide an incisive reality check.\nThe \u201cconsultant\u201d can be a member of the family\u2014Bill Gates, for instance,\nroutinely uses his wife as a sounding board. Other people turn to a longtime\nfriend or associate, as British tycoon Lord James Hanson relied heavily on his\nU.S.-based business partner Sir Gordon White. Increasingly, leaders also work\nwith executive coaches to get an outside view.\n\nWhen leaders wish to manage followers\u2019 transferences, as well as their own,\nthey can start by bringing the unconscious into awareness\u2014which is what Freud\nis all about. This effort is especially important when staff members view a\nleader through different transferential lenses. In such a situation, a leader\ncan deal with his followers\u2019 transferences by showing himself more as he\nactually is, thereby demystifying his professional relationships. But don\u2019t\ncount on these steps to eliminate projections. So long as they are\nunconscious, transferences remain strong. What\u2019s worse, the positive\ntransference of the follower is likely to become negative before it\ndisappears, as we have seen in public attitudes toward U.S. presidents.\n\nIn consulting with CEOs, I\u2019ve had them and their executive teams answer the\npersonality questionnaire from my book The Productive Narcissist as a way to\ndiscuss how the personalities of the individuals influence their leadership\nstyle and how they relate to one another and their followers. This exercise\nhas increased mutual understanding and objectivity, sometimes uncovering\nproblematic transferences. In one case, it became clear that a chief financial\nofficer was totally focused on pleasing the CEO, who was a father figure for\nher. She was resentful that the CEO didn\u2019t show her more attention; at the\nsame time, however, she ignored several vice presidents who offered their\nhelp. The more people know one another and the rules of the game, the harder\nit is to project and the more obviously unreal the projections will be.\n\nAs the new CEO of DAI, an international development company struggling to\nmanage its growth, Tony Barclay took precisely this approach in succeeding a\nfather figure CEO. In order to prevent people from automatically relating to\nhim as a patriarch or else resenting him as the brother who usurped the\nfather, Barclay took a lot of time and trouble to make sure that all his\nemployees knew him very well. He also went to great lengths to help them\nrealize that their rewards and promotions depended on their own performance,\nnot on their relationship with him. Barclay calls his style of leadership\n\u201cmanagement by consequence,\u201d and it essentially centers on building a mutual\nunderstanding between leader and follower.\n\nBarclay\u2019s approach has not only mitigated negative transferences and childlike\ndependencies at DAI; it also has made Barclay into a role model for his\nmanagers and other employees. Becoming a role model strengthens a leader\u2019s\nauthority and inspires teamwork and company spirit. We can see this dynamic at\nwork in sports teams. Michael Jordan, especially when he was at his prime\nplaying for the Chicago Bulls, was the unquestioned leader of a group of\nhighly paid athletes who would not easily accept authority. Rather than expect\nJordan to be a caring parent, teammates wanted to \u201cbe like Mike.\u201d The\ndifficulty of the role-model approach is that you can\u2019t fake it. Employees\nhave to see you as an authentic ideal, like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. (Of\ncourse, you also need employees with enough talent and confidence to feel they\ncan be like Bill or Steve.) Barclay says that sustaining this role takes a lot\nof work. \u201cIf you get lazy, you\u2019ll lose it.\u201d\n\nThe path to mutual understanding is often a long one, and organizations can\nimplode before treatment strategies take effect. One way to speed things up a\nlittle is the time-honored tactic of creating an outside enemy. This provides\na short-term boost to employees\u2019 positive transferences, allowing them to get\nover negative feelings about the leader, at least for a while. This approach\nstrengthened the transferential following of George W. Bush after September\n11, 2001, as he emphasized his leadership in protecting the United States from\nterrorist threats. (However, we have seen that this kind of transference can\nturn negative when leadership appears to fail.) Former CEO Goran Collert took\nthe outside-enemy approach at Swedbank. He told employees that the bank faced\nthreats not only from Swedish competitors but also from the Danes, the Dutch,\nand the Germans. The psychological impact of the threat\u2014real or not\u2014was to\nstrengthen workers\u2019 positive transference with Collert as a leader.\n\nEffective as the outside-enemy tactic can be in buying a leader some time to\nunderstand and manage the transference problem, it does carry serious long-\nterm dangers. In time, insecurity and anxiety in the face of the outside\nthreat can cause people to regress to a childlike state where they want their\nleader to protect them. They don\u2019t step up to responsibility, and their\nanxiety becomes corrosive to the organization. Additionally, when a leader\nstarts acting like a general marshaling forces against the enemy, employees\ncan become more afraid of the authoritative leader than of the external\nthreat. Creating a common enemy, therefore, is a strategy that should always\nbe used sparingly and never in isolation.\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nNo leader will ever be able to completely control his followers\u2019 unconscious\nmotivations\u2014transference is too deeply ingrained in human nature for that. Yet\nif the organization is to be protected from itself, followers\u2019 projections and\nmotivations must be channeled and managed. The challenge is especially urgent\nfor today\u2019s organizations, in which increasing diversity requires us all to\nmove away from stereotyping and really understand differences in personality\nand ways of thinking and learning.\n\n1\\.
