Valuation was seen as an arbitrary milestone on the road to IPO as\ninvestors ratcheted up the price and exit expectations to produce ever more\nimpressive (paper) returns.\n\nSomewhere during this period of easy money and endless growth, investors\nstopped thinking seriously about valuation. All that mattered were comps based\non trends in similar transactions. A startup would be awarded a market-based\nmultiple based on its growth rate, revenue and \u2014 where investors were\nunusually diligent \u2014 their margins.\n\nEventually, even smart investors started saying things like \u201conly market-\npassing valuations matter,\u201d as a way of dismissing sincere attempts to\nunderstand and rationalize private company value.\n\nWe had entered an overcapitalized environment where financial discipline was\nno longer valued, and those muscles were starting to atrophy.\n\n## The importance of a common vocabulary\n\nMost investors have since forgotten what valuation is supposed to represent,\nas the nomenclature of venture capital has failed to keep pace with the\ngrowth. Consequently, you can ask a dozen of the sharpest investors what they\nthink of valuation, and get a dozen different answers.\n\nThe danger is that investors end up overthinking valuation, conflating it with\npricing and seeking a convoluted consensus through averages that have no real\nplace in an asset class focused on outliers.\n\nThat approach also misrepresents the simple fact that the price of a\nnonfungible asset is agreed between the two sides of a transaction, not a\nuniversal truth.\n\n(Pricing based on comparison can make sense as a fund strategy for mature\ncompanies or in a more concentrated sector like B2B SaaS, but that falls apart\nquickly when you look elsewhere.)\n\n## A definition of startup valuation\n\nFundamentally, without getting bogged down in methodology, valuation is a\nframework through which investors can better understand a startup by analyzing\nqualitative and quantitative factors which reflect risk and potential. It\nenables a more complete and comprehensive understanding of that particular\ncompany, the business model and the implied scale of returns.\n\nWe can clarify this further by establishing two things that startup valuation\nisn\u2019t.\n\nValuation is not pricing. If your estimation of value is based purely on\nmarket momentum, similar transactions, investor demand and competition, then\nwe end up with a mindless procyclical environment like 2021.\n\nValuation is not fund math. Having a binary investment decision based on a\ngiven price and a target ownership percentage does not imply a valuation, it\njust implies a threshold of tolerance.\n\nSo the complicated answer is that valuation is actually a component of\npricing, along with market conditions and fund math.\n\nPrice \u2014 determined by a combination of valuation, market analysis and fund\nmath \u2014 is ultimately the number that gets the deal done and is the topic you\nhear investors talking about most frequently, regardless of how they refer to\nit.\n\nDan Gray is an adviser supporting impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets,\nand is the head of marketing at Equidam, a platform for startup valuation.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\n\nStay up to date with recent funding rounds, acquisitions, and more with the\nCrunchbase Daily.\n\n#### You may also like\n\nArtificial intelligence \u2022 Communications tech \u2022 Cybersecurity \u2022 Fintech &\ne-commerce \u2022 Health, Wellness & Biotech \u2022 Semiconductors and 5G \u2022 Startups \u2022\nVenture\n\n## The Week\u2019s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Metsera And Rivos Headline A Slow\nWeek\n\nChris Metinko\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nIt only took raising about $30 million-plus to make this week's list.
