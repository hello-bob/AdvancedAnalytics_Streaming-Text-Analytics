Henderson discusses his writing process, interestingly, downplaying the\nrole of talent:\n\n> Yes, you need some bare minimum level of ability to be a good writer, but\n> not as much as you might think. It also implies that the writer can only do\n> things he or she is \u201cgood at.\u201d Most people aren\u2019t working jobs which demand\n> some unique talent.\n\nI think he greatly underestimates how much \u2018bare minimum level of ability\u2019\nbeing a good writer entails. It\u2019s like an MLB player or a PGA golfer\ninstructing that all you have to to do is \u2018hit the ball strait\u2019 or something\nto that effect. That is the desired outcome, yes, but this elides all the\nstuff that goes into making that happen.\n\nGood writing is one of the hardest things to do I have found. Despite how it\u2019s\noften assumed that math is higher on the \u2018difficulty hierarchy\u2019 compared to\nthe \u2018soft and subjective\u2019 humanities, having done both [0], I can say although\nmath may be conceptually harder, writing as a skill may be harder to master or\nhave success at.\n\nTaking the opposite position of Mr. Henderson, talent is immensely important,\neven if the process of writing seems deceptively simple (e.g. just write).\nThis is because there are many writers who already have the time and\ninclination to write, so controlling for that environmental factor, what\nremain are innate factors, and clearly some writers are much more successful\nthan others.\n\nMuch like soccer, in contrast to something expensive like skiing or ice\nhockey, writing is has low barriers to entry and many participants, so this\nmakes innate factors more important, much like how soccer is popular in South\nAmerica, but only the most talented youth can make a career at it. It\u2019s not\nlike 13-year-olds who aspire to play soccer have careers or family\nobligations, so this means talent is the deciding factor.\n\nYes, luck plays some role, but having read a lot, the most successful writers\nare also adept at things like structure, \u2018turn of phrase\u2019, word choice and\nother subtle but invaluable aspects of writing. Talent is insufficient but\nnecessary. Bad writing is always DOA; good writing at least has a shot.\nTalented people are at least at up for consideration given that their skills\nare on par and hence have some hope, whereas untalented people are generally\nalways passed up and have no hope.\n\nLuck does matter, but I am of the opinion talent is necessary to be lucky;\nthat is, lucky people are almost always talented, and some talented people are\nunlucky and fail to reach their full potential. But the talent is always\nthere. An example is actors auditioning for a leading role; they may all have\ntalent, but only one can land the role. It\u2019s mathematically likely someone who\nauditions enough times will land a role eventually, but only if the talent is\nthere.\n\nI\u2019m sure some have seen quotes along the lines that \u2018Stephen King was rejected\nby 30 publishers\u2019 or that \u2018Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune was rejected 20 times\u2019. Same\nfor J. K. Rowling. Yes, this is normal and expected, even among talented\nwriters. A publishing house is inundated with far more manuscripts than it can\never hope to publish, so rejection rates will always be high. But because\nthose authors were talented and hence the writing up to par, they just needed\nto wait. The odds, although low for any individual publishing house, were\nnever zero on a long enough timeline.\n\nOf course, practice matters too. Almost anyone who aspires to be good at\nsomething practices a lot, yet outcomes vary greatly. What makes Magnus\nCarlsen so dominant at chess; it\u2019s not like he practices more than his\nopponents, who also practice a lot. Today\u2019s pre-teen chess grandmasters are\nbeating veterans who put in their \u2018ten-thousand hours\u2019, alluding to Malcolm\nGladwell, the Canadian author of the 2008 best-selling Outliers, that produced\na legacy of far more self-help pablum than any actually successful people who\nfollowed it. It\u2019s evident some people get much more millage for their practice\nor hours compared to others, for any competitive endeavor. Some quickly move\nup the ranks; most stagnate.\n\nBut even if talent matters, can good writing be taught? Beyond the basics like\npunctuation, likely not. No amount of practice can make someone with an IQ of,\nsay, 105, write like Moldbug. Even good writing that seems easy or effortless\nis hard to reproduce. Verbosity works for Moldbug, just as simplicity works\nfor other writers. In either case, the writing succeeds, but this cannot be\nsaid for untalented writers. Why these two totally opposite writing styles\n\u2018work\u2019 is hard to explicate, but they do.\n\nConsider a passage from a 2005 essay by the late Christopher Hitchens about\nhis disdain for Christmas, \u201cIt was at Thanksgiving this year that, making my\nway through an airport, I was confronted by the leering and antlered visage of\nwhat to my disordered senses appeared to be a bloody great moose. Only as\nreason regained her throne did I realize that the reindeer\u2014that plague\nspecies\u2014were back.\u201d It is little wonder he was so successful.\n\nIt would seem such biting but eloquent writing, from the cadence of the prose\nto the word choice, can only be acquired by the guiding invisible hand of\ntalent, not taught.\n\nAdditionally, you cannot \u2018focus group\u2019 writing, unlike other mediums of\ninformation. Disney can predict with a high degree of certainty that its\nsuperhero movies will do well, as there is a large, built-in market for those\nmovies, and they tend to be conceived on the same creative blueprint or\nfoundation. Even its \u2018duds\u2019 that only gross hundreds of millions of dollars\ninstead of billions are still profitable.\n\nBut this is not possible with writing, especially not internet writing. What\nis the market for short-form non-fiction? Who knows. It\u2019s hit or miss, mostly\nmiss. Writing tips are not that helpful either because it\u2019s so situational and\nunpredictable in terms of the audience and how the work is received, and it\u2019s\nhard to generalize any specific methods that work especially well.\n\nPeople know good writing when they see it, or can subconsciously appreciate\ngood writing. But the rub is good writing cannot be reproduced in the way a\ncar can be reproduced at an assembly line, in that there is no set of\ninstructions or blueprint that reliably produces good writing\u2013just, at best,\nheuristics that sometimes work but often don\u2019t. In computer science parlance,\nit\u2019s like finding the preimage of a hash.\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s hard to explicate precisely or in rule-form what makes\nwriting good, is why the profession is surprisingly resilient to AI. AI-\ngenerated writing has a certain unmistakable clunkiness or wordiness (more\nlike excessive punctuation and prepositions, not like how Moldbug is wordy)\nthat gives it away. Despite fears of AI destroying jobs, the job of re-writing\nAI-generated content to sound more human-like or readable is thriving for this\nreason.\n\nOverall, talent is that which persists after everything else is controlled\nfor. I don\u2019t want to sound too dismissive of effort and practice, but again,\nthis not account for the huge variability of outcomes for talent to be ignored\naltogether. Readers can appreciate talent on a subconscious level even if it\ncannot be articulated, and show such appreciation by consuming the works of\ntalented writers. Those who are talented should persist, as bad luck may\nchange, but otherwise the proposition for continuing if talent is absent and\nonly relying on luck or effort, is much weaker.\n\n[0] This includes accumulating a combined 700 points on the\nMathOverflow/MathExchange sites over the past year, such as providing what was\nat the time the first and only proof to a difficult recursion/combinatorics\nproblem\u2013something that you would find from Stanley. Years ago someone showed\nit was true empirically but provided no proof. The following day, a well-\nestablished mathematician posted a similar solution following the same\napproach as mine (recently-answered questions get bumped, so presumably he saw\nthe problem). So my reference point or benchmark of \u2018math being easier\u2019 is not\nsomething easy or trivial like high school algebra.\n\nPublished April 29, 2024By smartistone\n\nCategorized as Uncategorized\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n## Pages\n\n## Archives\n\n## Archives\n\nGrey Enlightenment\n\nProudly powered by WordPress.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
