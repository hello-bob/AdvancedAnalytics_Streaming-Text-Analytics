Over 20 years ago, two commissions\nwere created to investigate, respectively, the surprise 9/11 terror attacks\nand the IC\u2019s erroneous assessments of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\nBoth found shortcomings in the IC\u2019s exploitation of publicly available\ninformation. The 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of an OSINT agency\nwhile the WMD Commission faulted the absence of \u201cany broader program to gather\nand organize the wealth of global information generated each day and\nincreasingly available, if only temporarily, over the Internet.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) was established in\n2005 to better integrate the IC\u2019s 17 elements. One of the first acts of the\nnew director of national intelligence (DNI), John Negroponte, was to create an\nODNI Open Source Center (OSC). But the establishment of the ODNI did not end\nturf battles within the IC, including over OSINT. The ODNI OSC was housed\nwithin the CIA and incorporated the CIA\u2019s Foreign Broadcast Information\nService, which had been translating foreign media reports since World War II.\nIt is difficult to delineate the respective roles of the ODNI and the CIA in\nthe IC\u2019s OSINT effort over the following decade. In 2015, the CIA reasserted\nits leadership of OSINT, and, as part of a major CIA restructure, today\u2019s CIA\nOpen Source Enterprise (OSE) was established.\n\nCriticism of the IC\u2019s failure to make adequate use of OSINT has, however, only\ngrown as the digital information revolution has accelerated. The comparative\nsuccess of nongovernment OSINT organizations, particularly Bellingcat, has\nadded weight to the critique voiced by many former intelligence officers,\nthough at least one current intelligence officer has added a voice to this\nchorus. For example, a 2022 RAND study concluded that \u201copen-source is not\nworking, it is not getting better, and the Open-Source Enterprise had ample\nopportunity to change.\u201d The RAND study was based on interviews with, among\nothers, the recently departed principal deputy DNI, deputy DNI, chair of the\nNational Intelligence Council, and the Defense Intelligence Agency director of\nanalysis.\n\nThe IC\u2019s new OSINT Strategy 2024-2026 has been praised for getting the basics\nright, and current OSE Director Randy Nixon has been commendably forthright in\nexplaining how the CIA is now adopting cutting-edge technology to meet the\nOSINT challenge. The 2024 strategy is titled \u201cThe INT of First Resort.\u201d That\nis a modest goal, which was first articulated by the ODNI in 2006. The fact\nthat it has taken the IC almost two decades to start addressing fundamental\nissues\u2014such as establishing integrated OSINT collection management and common\ntraining standards\u2014suggests that the IC\u2019s suboptimal exploitation of OSINT is\nnot simply the result of turf battles, bureaucratic structures, or technical\ncapabilities. The IC\u2019s culture of secrecy also constrains its embrace of\nOSINT. More fundamental reform is necessary to adapt the IC to the digital\ninformation age.\n\nFighting the Last War\n\nThere is a fundamental mismatch between IC institutions devoted to secret\nintelligence and the emerging information environment.\n\nThe IC was established to fight the Cold War. According to Mark Lowenthal,\nauthor of the seminal text Intelligence: From Secrets to Policy, during that\ncontest \u201c80 percent of the information the US required was secret and 20\npercent was open.\u201d It\u2019s safe to assume that much more of the information\nWashington now needs can be openly or commercially sourced.\n\nThe digital information revolution is generating a dramatically new operating\nenvironment for intelligence organizations. It\u2019s not just the volume of data\nbut also the diversity and speed. Everything from simple Google searches to\nthe complex extraction of data from an increasingly fragmented cyberspace can\nprovide valuable information. Private-sector intelligence capabilities\nincreasingly match or exceed those of nation-states while commercial data\nbrokers gather digital dust, which \u201cincludes information on nearly everyone\nthat is of a type and level of sensitivity that historically could have been\nobtained, if at all, only through targeted ... collection.\u201d\n\nThe digital revolution is transforming not only the operating environment for\nthe IC but also its purpose. Information is not only a means for understanding\ngeopolitical competition but a central domain of that contest. While states\nhave always competed to obtain and protect data, there is a growing need to be\nthe fastest to gain actionable insights and act on them. Successful statecraft\nincreasingly demands winning the information competition and shaping public\nnarratives. The IC must further adapt to support this statecraft.\n\nStrategic Declassification\u2014Innovation or Catch Up?\n\nThe IC has responded to this challenge by accelerating \u201cstrategic\ndeclassification,\u201d defined by CIA Director Bill Burns as \u201cthe intentional\npublic disclosure of certain secrets to undercut rivals and rally allies.\u201d In\nthe lead-up to Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. and U.K. wrong-\nfooted Russian President Vladimir Putin, pre-bunked Moscow\u2019s disinformation,\nand accelerated the formation of a countervailing coalition by downgrading and\ndeclassifying secret intelligence.\n\nThe process for strategic declassification has been refined since then.\nWhereas the ODNI once received one or two requests per month to lower the\nclassification on reports, it now sometimes receives many more than that in a\nday. To obscure sources and methods, downgraded intelligence is disseminated\nin packages that combine secret intelligence and OSINT.\n\nStrategic declassification has been rightly hailed as a success. It has\nenabled the U.S. to better inform the public, counter disinformation, and\nshape narratives. Yet the underlying idea\u2014that intelligence should be produced\nin forms that are optimally useful for policymakers\u2014should not be novel. The\npiecemeal approach to declassification won\u2019t keep pace with the accelerating\ndemands of information competition. It\u2019s also reasonable to ask how often the\nvaunted downgrade process is, in practice, simply applying the correct\nclassification. Chris Rasmussen rightly asks why the military staging maps of\nRussian equipment shared with the Washington Post prior to the invasion of\nUkraine needed to be classified in the first place.\n\nThe tendencies of intelligence organizations to overclassify and undershare\ninformation are manifestations of a wider culture of secrecy. IC culture is\nthe most frequently invoked (but rarely defined) obstacle to the IC\u2019s embrace\nof OSINT.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the IC has fostered a culture of secrecy\u2014it supports\nthe mission of obtaining, protecting, analyzing, and disseminating secrets.\nBut it has also inadvertently encouraged the view that information is valuable\nbecause it is secret rather than vice versa. Psychological factors such as the\n\u201cendowment effect\u201d and the \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d have probably reinforced that\ntendency.\n\nPerennial problems like overclassification won\u2019t be fixed through either ad\nhoc declassification or exhortations from CIA Director Burns to judiciously\nresist the \u201creflexive urge to keep everything classified.\u201d Rather, new\nstructural incentives are needed for the IC to more proactively produce more\nusable intelligence products.\n\nAn OSINT Agency for the Information Age\n\nThe establishment of a dedicated OSINT agency would be a step toward\nreconfiguring the IC for the challenges of the information age. Properly\nimplemented, this reform should deliver improved OSINT and secret intelligence\nwhile optimizing the relationship between the two disciplines.\n\nThe most common argument for establishing an OSINT agency is that this is the\nonly way to ensure that the discipline of OSINT obtains sufficient resources\nand heft within the hypercompetitive IC. For example, Amy Zegart argues that\nthat \u201cas long as open-source intelligence remains embedded in secret agencies\nthat value clandestine information above all, it will languish\u201d because those\nagencies won\u2019t prioritize or champion OSINT. But why shouldn\u2019t the IC just\ndepend on the private sector to meet its OSINT needs? A growing array of\ncommercial organizations now produce OSINT to supplement the work of\ntraditional media and not-for-profit organizations like Bellingcat. But even\nthe most reputable OSINT organizations are ultimately guided by their own\ninterests, commercial or otherwise. An OSINT agency would have distinct\nauthorities and be unambiguously guided by IC priorities. It would work\nclosely with nongovernment OSINT providers and, unencumbered by the\nbureaucracy of secrecy, would be better able to do so. The OSINT agency\u2019s seal\nof approval might be the only value it adds to a commercial product, but in an\nincreasingly uncertain information environment, that reassurance will become\never more valuable.\n\nA dedicated OSINT agency would also improve the production of secret\nintelligence. The accuracy of U.S. and U.K. insights into Putin\u2019s intentions\nin Ukraine demonstrated the perennial need for and value of secret\nintelligence. But prioritizing scarce collection resources is a constant\nchallenge. Isolating the most valuable secrets has become harder in the\ninformation age. The improved production of OSINT would avoid duplication and\nallow classified resources to be more sharply focused on hard targets. As the\nRAND report points out, \u201c[U]ntil the IC truly invests in OSINT across the\nrange of intelligence topic areas, the community will not know for sure which\ntopics can be covered adequately by OSINT.\u201d\n\nThe strongest argument against establishing a separate OSINT organization is\nthat it runs directly counter to the goal of intelligence integration.\nIntegrating OSINT and secret intelligence is an important objective, but the\ndownsides of attempting to do so within a secret umbrella have now been amply\ndemonstrated. OSINT differs fundamentally from secret intelligence precisely\nbecause it is derived from open sources. Indeed, OSINT differs more from\nsecret intelligence than human intelligence, signals intelligence, and\ngeospatial intelligence\u2014each of which has a dedicated agency\u2014differ from one\nanother. IC leaders have long urged their officers to treat OSINT as the\nintelligence of first resort. A dedicated OSINT agency would remove the\nchoice.\n\nThe challenge is not simply to integrate OSINT and secret intelligence but to\noptimize the relationship between the two disciplines. Productive competition\nbetween OSINT and secret intelligence should be enabled and encouraged. OSINT\nis faster, cheaper, and more easily shared than secret intelligence.\nCompetitive pressure from improved OSINT should be used both to encourage\nsecret agencies to target valuable secrets and to discourage them from\noverclassifying information. The output from a dedicated OSINT agency would\ncreate stronger incentives for the IC to proactively produce intelligence that\nis optimally useful for policymakers, rather than waiting for requests to\ndowngrade and declassify.\n\nThe culture of secrecy has long constrained the IC\u2019s embrace of OSINT. The\npower of OSINT should now be harnessed to disrupt the culture of secrecy. It\u2019s\ndistinctly possible that, over time, secret intelligence will become a niche\nspecialization within a larger OSINT enterprise. Establishing a dedicated\nOSINT agency would not bring about such a radical change, but it would make it\npossible and leave the IC better postured for the information age.\n\nTopics:\n\nIntelligence\n\nBack to Top\n\n### Ben Scott\n\nRead More\n\nBen Scott is a Senior Advisor at the National Security College.
