According to Nigel Kersten, software leaders should leverage\ntech to create positive changes in organisational dynamics and relationships\nbetween teams.\n\nNigel Kersten spoke about how technology can drive culture change at FlowCon\nFrance 2024.\n\nCultural change efforts across larger tech organizations tend to fail often.\nThe most common problem is a failure to define what \"cultural change\" actually\nmeans, Kersten said. \"Culture\" is far too broad a term, and unless you\nidentify specific and actionable issues that you want to address, you won\u2019t\nsucceed:\n\n> First, you\u2019ll find that everyone has a different idea of what \"culture\"\n> means and a different set of issues in mind, which makes progress difficult.\n> Secondly, you\u2019ll find that without a more specific and concrete set of\n> goals, people will lack confidence that they can create any kind of impact,\n> and will feel helpless.\n\nIn most software organisations, it is technological improvements that make it\npossible to fix the sorts of issues around organisational dynamics and bad\nproduct delivery, Kersten said. Improvements don\u2019t automatically happen due to\nnew tech capabilities, but they do become possible if leaders take advantage\nof them, he added.\n\nKersten argued that most technologists want to learn new things, as there\u2019s a\nnatural incentive there for their own careers:\n\n> If they understand what the business is trying to achieve and why, and\n> you\u2019re regularly listening to your teams in the way good leaders do, then\n> suggestions for new tech will naturally emerge.\n\nThe job of a tech leader is to work out how to leverage this new tech to\ncreate positive changes in organisational dynamics and relationships between\nteams, Kersten mentioned.\n\nTech that creates simplified abstractions over complexity drives the greatest\ncultural change, Kersten said. Think of containers, VMs, infrastructure-as-\ncode, software-defined-networking, collaborative version control, and CI/CD:\n\n> The tools in this space all enable subject matter experts to bundle up their\n> expertise and make it usable by a larger group of people.\n\nThis democratisation makes it easier to have that larger group work towards a\ncommon goal, which allows teams to work at their own pace without waiting for\nsomeone else to fulfil their request, ultimately making it easier to solve\nproblems for your users, Kersten concluded.\n\nInfoQ interviewed Nigel Kersten about driving culture change with technology.\n\nInfoQ: You mentioned in your talk that getting to fast flow or doing platform\nengineering well is much more than a shift in culture. What\u2019s needed to\nsupport technological change in organizations?\n\n> Nigel Kersten: If you\u2019re an organisational leader, the very best thing you\n> can do to enable technical change is to create engaged, satisfied teams with\n> clear context around your business goals, incentivise them to look for\n> continuous improvements, and then give them the time, space, and support to\n> investigate new technologies.\n>\n> Common examples here are anything to do with automation. If teams have the\n> space to learn new skills and apply them to automate manual tasks, then it\u2019s\n> a relatively simple next step to expose that automation to other teams and\n> to start creating self-service interfaces. This could be something as simple\n> as the remediation of a certain kind of issue in production, or updating a\n> configuration setting.\n\nInfoQ: What are the things that we can or cannot improve with software?\n\n> Kersten: Software won\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t have a strategy, if you don\u2019t\n> have a clear vision, and if you don\u2019t have a clear set of goals you want\n> your organisation to achieve. It won\u2019t help you fix diversity issues on your\n> teams, and it won\u2019t help you create psychological safety, which we know is a\n> primary driver of successful teams.\n>\n> Software can help you with improving internal and external feedback loops,\n> speeding up decision-making, inter-team interactions, and the impact that\n> teams can have on the business, but not without conscious effort from\n> leadership. Software by itself is never a magic bullet.\n\n## About the Author\n\n#### Ben Linders\n\nBen Linders is an Independent Consultant in Agile, Lean, Quality and\nContinuous Improvement, based in The Netherlands.
