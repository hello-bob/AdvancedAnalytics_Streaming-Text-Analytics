In an ideal scenario, work\nis fulfilling. But many people in office jobs find their daily work is making\nthem miserable. Of course, it could be argued that the dissatisfaction of\nthese employees is mainly a by-product of industrialization. They\u2019re in\nsecure, non-physically demanding professions that are often relatively well\npaid - unlike many people in this world living in vastly more dire\ncircumstances. But is this unparalleled waste of human resources one of the\nbiggest untold dramas of our time? \"The Happy Worker\" explores the reasons why\nhighly paid managers are so fond of parroting hackneyed phrases, following\nabstruse management methods and poisoning the working atmosphere for the\nbenefit of shareholders. According to a Gallup poll, just 13 per cent of the\nworking population endeavor to perform well in their job. However, 64 per cent\nof employees don\u2019t care about their work and aim to get through the day with\nminimum effort. 25 per cent of workers hate their jobs so much they even work\nagainst the company that employs them. Although the numbers vary from country\nto country, these trends can be observed all over the world. A sense that\ntheir work is pointless makes many people ill. The documentary hears from\npatients recovering from burnout. The accounts of their experiences are\nappraised by a number of experts including the Berkeley-based pioneer of\nresearch into burnout, the psychologist Christina Maslach. #documentary\n#dwdocumentary #burnout #work ______ DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond\nthe headlines.
