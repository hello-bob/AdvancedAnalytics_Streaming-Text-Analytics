Hawkins / The Verge\n\nLuminar, which makes lidar sensors for autonomous driving systems, announced\ntoday plans to lay off 20 percent of its workforce amid a broader\nrestructuring of its production process.\n\nThe company, which just announced shipments of its next-generation laser\nsensors to Volvo, said that it will transition to an \u201casset light\u201d business\nmodel that will see more of its production outsourced to its partners. As part\nof the restructuring, at least 147 people will lose their jobs. Luminar has at\nleast 730 employees based in the US, according to LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cMany of these team members have been on our journey with us for years, which\nis why this is so difficult,\u201d Luminar CEO Austin Russell said in a statement.\n\u201cWe have also made the decision to roll off the majority of our contractors\nwho supported us to [start of production]. We have informed the affected\nemployees regarding the roles that are no longer required at this juncture.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of these team members have been on our journey with us for years.\u201d\n\nLuminar is one of the companies that rose to prominence as the tech industry\npromoted self-driving cars as the future of personal transportation. The\ncompany makes lidar, a key ingredient in autonomous driving that uses near-\ninfrared light to detect the shapes and distances of objects. This helps\nautonomous vehicles \u201csee\u201d other objects on the road, like cars, pedestrians,\nand cyclists, all without the help of GPS or a network connection.\n\nBut as autonomous vehicles have lost some of their luster, Luminar and other\nsupportive players have fallen on hard times. The company reported a net loss\nof $571.3 million for 2023, up from $445.9 million in 2022. It also brought in\n$69.7 million in revenue, up from $40.7 million the previous year. Luminar\nplans to report its first quarter earnings next week.\n\nAs it seeks to reduce its costs, the company will outsource its\nindustrialization process to its existing partners. Luminar has inked deals to\nsell its lidar to Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Audi, Toyota Research Institute,\nIntel\u2019s Mobileye, Airbus, and two Chinese companies: automaker SAIC and AV\noperator Pony.ai. Russell said the company will rely on Taiwanese electronics\nmanufacturer TPK for \u201csubstantial dedicated industrialization resources.\u201d\n\nThe restructuring is expected to net the company $400 million in savings over\nthe next five years, Russell said, including $80 million in savings \u201con an\nannual run basis.\u201d\n\nThe layoffs at Luminar are just the latest setback to hit the struggling\nautonomous vehicle industry. Earlier this year, Apple axed its self-driving\ncar project, laying off 600 people in the process. Cruise, which is owned by\nGeneral Motors, axed 24 percent of its employees after a pedestrian was\ninjured by one of its driverless vehicles. And Aurora, which is working on\nautonomous trucks, cut 3 percent of its staff.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\n## Inside the flop that changed Apple forever\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nApple\u2019s Macintosh, released in 1984, is celebrated for ushering in a new era\nof user-friendly computing.
