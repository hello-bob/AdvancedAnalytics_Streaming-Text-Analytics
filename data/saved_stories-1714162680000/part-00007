University of Tokyo\n\nAfter decades of excavations in Italy, archaeologists have discovered a villa\nthat could have belonged to Augustus, the first emperor of Rome.\n\nSince 2002, researchers from the University of Tokyo have been exploring Somma\nVesuviana, an archaeological site north of Mount Vesuvius, the volcano that\nextinguished the ancient city of Pompeii in 79 C.E. Recently, these\nexcavations revealed a structure destroyed by the same eruption.\n\nResearchers think this site could be Augustus\u2019 lost villa. According to the\nteam, Roman sources say Augustus died in a villa north of the mountain in 14\nC.E., but the building\u2019s location has never been verified.\n\n\u201cThere is a description that [the villa] was consecrated ... but its existence\nhas not been identified to this day,\u201d says Mariko Muramatsu, leader of the\nuniversity\u2019s Somma Vesuviana excavation project, in a translated statement.\n\u201cIn recent years, our excavations have uncovered parts of buildings that were\nburied during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 C.E. This means that for\nthe first time in this area, a building contemporary with the villa of Emperor\nAugustus has been found with scientific support.\u201d\n\nThe University of Tokyo's excavations at Somma Vesuviana have been ongoing\nsince 2002. University of Tokyo\n\nThe ruins in question actually include two separate villas: one buried in the\n79 C.E. eruption and another built on top of it later, reports All That\u2019s\nInteresting\u2019s Amber Breese. Until recently, researchers had only been aware of\nthe newer structure.\n\nIn the older villa, archaeologists identified four rooms containing portions\nof wall, roof tiles and other ruins. In one chamber, researchers discovered 16\namphorae\u2014tall ancient Roman jars\u2014which were used to transport and store wine.\nIn another, they found \u201clarge amounts of charcoal and ash\u201d from a fire they\nbelieve was used to heat water for a private bathhouse, \u201cindicating that the\nvilla belonged to a person of great wealth and influence,\u201d per All That\u2019s\nInteresting.\n\nIn the mid-second century, people began constructing new buildings atop the\nsite of the buried villa, using its footprint as a guide. The new construction\nfeatured a grand hall filled with brick arches, marble columns and marble\nstatues. Around the fourth century, the site transformed again, becoming a\nlarge-scale wine production site. This villa was preserved by another eruption\nof Mount Vesuvius in 472.\n\nThe ruins of a furnace from the older villa University of Tokyo\n\nHistorians previously thought the damage from Vesuvius\u2019 79 C.E. eruption at\nthis site was \u201cminor compared to the southeast of the mountain,\u201d but the older\nvilla\u2019s ruins suggest \u201cthere was also a destructive impact in this area,\u201d\nreports La Br\u00fajula Verde\u2019s Guillermo Carvajal. Researchers think the structure\ncollapsed due to pyroclastic flows\u2014dense, fast masses of ash and gas expelled\nby the volcano.\n\nThe researchers theorize that Augustus could have once occupied the older\nvilla. Born Gaius Octavius Thurinus, the young man was granted the name\nAugustus\u2014the \u201cexalted one\u201d\u2014by the Roman Senate in 27 B.C.E. While Augustus\ndidn\u2019t use the title of \u201cemperor\u201d in his lifetime, he was a pivotal figure in\nRoman history who more than doubled the empire\u2019s size during his 40-year\nreign.\n\nResearchers from the Somma Vesuviana excavation project hope to expand the\nscale of their digs. As Muramatsu says in the statement, further exploration\ncould reveal \u201canother Pompeii,\u201d helping historians \u201ctrace the achievements of\nEmperor Augustus and the beginnings of the Roman Empire.\u201d\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nSonja Anderson | READ MORE\n\nSonja Anderson is a writer and reporter based in New York City.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1.
