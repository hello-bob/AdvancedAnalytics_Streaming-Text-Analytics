If a developer offered a free app and had first annual\napp installs of over 1 million installations, they would owe the \u20ac0.50 per\ninstallation fee, regardless of the fact they earned no income from the app.\nThe fee, as proposed, would likewise be a problem for developers with other\nsources of income that weren\u2019t enough to pay the CTF.\n\nToday, Apple made two changes to the way the CTF works:\n\n>   * First, no CTF is required if a developer has no revenue whatsoever. This\n> includes creating a free app without monetization that is not related to\n> revenue of any kind (physical, digital, advertising, or otherwise). This\n> condition is intended to give students, hobbyists, and other non-commercial\n> developers an opportunity to create a popular app without paying the CTF.\n>   * Second, small developers (less than \u20ac10 million in global annual\n> business revenue*) that adopt the alternative business terms receive a\n> 3-year free on-ramp to the CTF to help them create innovative apps and\n> rapidly grow their business. Within this 3-year period, if a small developer\n> that hasn\u2019t previously exceeded one million first annual installs crosses\n> the threshold for the first time, they won\u2019t pay the CTF, even if they\n> continue to exceed one million first annual installs during that time. If a\n> small developer grows to earn global revenue between \u20ac10 million and \u20ac50\n> million within the 3-year on-ramp period, they\u2019ll start to pay the CTF after\n> one million first annual installs up to a cap of \u20ac1 million per year.\n>\n\nThe first change should take care of the free app scenario regardless of its\npopularity. The second change is designed to transition small businesses into\npaying the CTF. The first time a business with less than \u20ac10 million of global\nannual revenue crosses the CTF threshold, they won\u2019t pay the fee. They will,\nhowever, have to start paying the fee up to a \u20ac1 million cap if the business\u2019\nglobal annual income grows to between \u20ac10 million and \u20ac50 million in that\n3-year period. If revenue exceeds that range, the cap on the CTF presumably\nwould not apply.\n\nIn the same post, Apple confirmed that the same EU rules that apply to iOS\nwill begin to apply to iPadOS this fall and that a download of an app on both\niOS and iPadOS will only count as one annual installation for CTF purposes.\n\nTags: app store, devleopers, DMA, regulation\n\nJoin\n\n### Unlock More with Club MacStories\n\nFounded in 2015, Club MacStories has delivered exclusive content every week\nfor over six years.\n\nIn that time, members have enjoyed nearly 400 weekly and monthly newsletters\npacked with more of your favorite MacStories writing as well as Club-only\npodcasts, eBooks, discounts on apps, icons, and services.
