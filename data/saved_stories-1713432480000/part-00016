I Quit, Too\n\n10 minute read\n\nEliza Milio at Front Porch Farm in Healdsburg, Calif., on April 25,\n2020.Courtesy Eliza Milio\n\nIdeas\n\nBy Eliza Milio\n\nApril 16, 2024 11:00 AM EDT\n\nMilio spent a decade farming organic food and flowers in California, where she\nwitnessed the impacts of climate change on small farms firsthand. She\ncurrently works to enable farmers to be more resilient in the face of climate\nchange through her role as the Agricultural Stewardship Program Manager at the\nSan Mateo Resource Conservation District\n\nIn 2023, Scott Chang-Fleeman\u2014a young farmer like me\u2014put down his shovel. A\npost on his Instagram read, \u201cShao Shan Farm, in its current form, is going on\nindefinite hiatus.\u201d From the outside, the burgeoning farm had the makeup of\none that could stand the test of time. In reality, his experience of farm\nownership was wrought with challenges.\n\nA farmer in his late 20s, Chang-Fleeman started Shao Shan Farm in 2019 to\nreconnect with his roots and provide a source of locally grown heritage Asian\nvegetables to the Bay Area. He quickly secured a clientele and fan base\u2014two of\nthe greatest hurdles of starting a farm\u2014and became the go-to for San\nFrancisco\u2019s high-end Asian eateries.\n\nBut after four years of creative pivots to withstand unexpected hurdles that\nincluded financial stress, severe drought, and a global pandemic, Chang-\nFleeman made a choice that many young farmers are considering: to leave\nfarming behind. Why he left and what could have kept him on the land are\ncritical questions we must address if we are to have a sustainable and food-\nsecure future.\n\nThe USDA Census of Agriculture reported that in 2017, nearly 1 in 4 of the 3.4\nmillion agricultural producers in the US were new and beginning farmers. Many\nof these new farmers are doing exactly what it seems American agriculture\nneeds: starting small farms. According to the most recent data from the\nAgricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) in 2019, farms with annual\nsales of less than $100,000 accounted for about 85% of all U.S. farms. And\nthough not all of these small-scale farms are necessarily organic, small farms\nare more likely to grow a diversity of crop types, use methods that reduce\nnegative impacts on the climate, increase carbon sequestration, and tend to be\nmore resilient in the face of climate change.\n\nRead More: How Extreme Weather Is Affecting Small Farmers Across the U.S.\n\nThere has been a growing interest among younger people in recent years in\nsustainable and organic farming practices, as well as in local food systems.\nThis interest has led people in their 20s and 30s to enter into small-scale\nfarming, particularly in niche markets such as organic produce, specialty\ncrops, and direct-to-consumer sales.\n\nAs a result, both congressional Democrats and Republicans have maintained that\nencouraging young people to farm is of utmost importance in ensuring the\nstability of our food system. But getting young people into farming may not be\nthe problem. Keeping them on the farm may be the hardest part.\n\nI should know. I quit too.\n\nScott Chang-Fleeman, owner and farmer of Shao Shan Farm, grows Asian\nvegetables in Bolinas, Calif. on May 2, 2019.Celeste Noche\n\nChang-Fleeman got his start in agriculture right out of college, where he\nspent several years working at the on-campus farm. As a third-generation\nChinese American, he noticed a distinct lack of Asian vegetables at local\nfarmers markets, particularly those that were grown organically, and suspected\nthere would be a demand should a supply exist. He started trialing some\nvarieties, and his suspicions were quickly affirmed when samples of his choy\nsum caught the attention of chef Brandon Jew of Mister Jiu\u2019s, a contemporary\nChinese eatery with a Michelin star in the heart of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown.\nJew provided some seed funds for what was to become Shao Shan Farm in 2019.\n\nDuring the first year running his farm, Chang-Fleeman focused his sales on his\nrelationships with local restaurants, while attending some farmers' markets\nsales to supplement income. But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020,\nhe lost all of his restaurant accounts overnight.\n\nLike many farmers at that time, he pivoted to a CSA model, offering farm boxes\nthat provide a household with an assortment of vegetables for the week.\n\n\u201cSo literally over a night, I reworked my crop plan\u201d he told me. \u201cJust to get\nthrough that year, or through that season, not knowing how long [the pandemic\nwas going to] last.\u201d\n\nAs if a global pandemic wasn\u2019t enough, in 2021, California entered a drought,\nand he lost the ability to irrigate his crops come mid-summer, which meant a\nhard stop for production.\n\n\u201cI was hoping to hit some sort of a rhythm, and every year felt a bit like\nstarting from scratch,\u201d Chang-Fleeman reflected.\n\nThroughout farm ownership, he worked side jobs to compensate for the slow\nbuild of business income and the fact that he could only afford to pay himself\na monthly salary of $2,000. He regularly worked 90 hours a week. At the same\ntime, farm expenses were on the rise.\n\n\u201cThe cost of our packaging went up like three times in one year and the cost\nof the produce didn't change,\u201d he explained. \u201cOur operating expenses went up\nlike 30%, after COVID.\u201d\n\nIn four short years, Chang-Fleeman experienced an avalanche of extenuating\ncircumstances that would bring most farm businesses to their knees. But the\nthing that finally catalyzed the closing of his business was burnout. He\nrelayed the experience of the exhaustion and stress building over time until\nhe reached a breaking point. \u201cIf I don\u2019t stop now, it\u2019s going to kill me,\u201d he\nrecalled thinking.\n\nChang-Fleeman\u2019s burnout reminded me of my own story. In the fall of 2018, I\ntook what ended up being a two-month medical leave from an organic farm I\nmanaged in Northern California in order to try to try to resolve a set of\nweird symptoms that included dizzy spells and heart palpitations. If you know\nanything about farming, fall is not the time to be absent. It\u2019s peak harvest\ntime and the culmination of all of your work is underway. But as my medical\nanomaly continued to worsen, I came no closer to getting back to work. After\nmany doctor visits, several trips to the specialist, a flurry of blood tests,\nand a week of heart monitoring, it took one Xanax to solve the mystery.\n\nRead More: \u2018They\u2019re Trying to Wipe Us Off the Map.\u2019 Small American Farmers Are\nNearing Extinction\n\nThe prolonged physical stress that I had been harboring at work had triggered\nthe onset of panic disorder, a nervous system affliction that had led me into\na near-chronic state of fight or flight mode, causing a swath of physical\nsymptoms not typically associated with \u201canxiety.\u201d\n\nFor me, this was a wake-up call. I turned to a slew of Western and\nnaturopathic remedies to alleviate my symptoms, but ultimately, removing the\nstressors of farm management was the thing that allowed me to, mostly, reach a\nnervous system balance. Even still, six years later, I\u2019m constantly navigating\nthe \u2018new normal\u2019 of this diagnosis.\n\nA pilot study conducted by agriculture researcher Josie Rudolphi and her\ncolleagues in 2020 found that of 170 participants, approximately 71% met the\ncriteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. By comparison, in the US, an\nestimated 18% of adults experience an anxiety disorder. Rudolphi\u2019s work\nindicates that these disorders maybe three times more prevalent in young\nfarmer and rancher populations.\n\nThis rang true as I went from farm to farm trying to figure out what so often\ngoes wrong in a new farm operation. Again and again mental health was a\nthrough-line. Collette Walsh, owner of a cut-flower operation in Braddock, PA,\nput it to me bluntly: \"I usually get to a point in late August or early\nSeptember, where there\u2019s a week where I just cry.\u201d\n\nHow can we build a farming economy that helps young farmers not only stay, but\nalso thrive on the land? The Farm Bill, a federal package of legislation that\nprovides funding for agricultural programs, is one route. As the reboot of the\nFarm Bill approaches, it\u2019s a critical time to ask these questions and advocate\nfor policies that support young farmers and the barriers they\u2019re facing in\nmaintaining a long-lasting career in agriculture.\n\nTake for instance, Jac Wypler, Farmer Mental Health Director at the National\nYoung Farmer Coalition (Young Farmers), who oversees the Northeast region\u2019s\nFarmer and Rancher Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN). The organization was\nestablished by the Farm Bill in 2018 to develop a service provider network for\nfarmers, ranchers, and other agricultural workers that was dedicated to mental\nwell-being. Through the network of service providers she directs, called\n\u201cCultivemos,\u201d Wypler and her colleagues utilize a multi-tiered approach to\naddress mental health in farming spaces. Cultivemos partners provide direct\nsupport in moments of stress and crisis as well as peer-to-peer support\nspaces.\n\nAn expanded (and subsidized) program that scales efforts like Cultivemos to a\nsize commensurate with the young work force is clearly needed. But it\u2019s only\npart of the picture.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe that it is important to make sure that farms, farmers, and\nfarmworkers are getting direct support around their mental health,\u201d Wypler\nexplained. \u201cWe need to alleviate what is causing them stress.\u201d\n\nCultivemos works to address the structural root causes of stress which can\ninclude climate change, land prices, and systemic racism, to name a few. They\nfocus on communities that are disproportionately harmed by these structural\nroot causes, specifically Black, Indigenous, and other farmers of color.\nFinally, they seek to make this impact by regranting funding directly into the\nhands of these farmers.\n\n\u201cThe way I think of regranting is that the USDA and these large institutions\nare the Mississippi River of funding.\u201d Wypler says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the\nfunding into these smaller rivers and tributaries to disperse these funds and\nshift that power dynamic and leadership dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe next Farm Bill cycle will be critical in ensuring this work is continued.\nIn November of 2023, lawmakers signed a stopgap funding bill that allows for a\none-year extension on the 2018 Farm Bill. Lawmakers are currently in\ndeliberations over the bill until September when it will be up for a vote.\nYoung Farmers underscores the importance of the appropriations process, which\nis when program areas that are authorized in the farm bill are allocated\nfunding.\n\nEliza Milio at Front Porch Farm in Healdsburg, Calif., on April 25,\n2020.Courtesy Eliza Milio\n\nBack-to-the-landism has waxed and waned throughout the last hundred years,\nbooming in the pre-Depression years of the 1930s, dying in the war years and\nthen storming back in the 60s and 70s. When my generation\u2019s own farming\nrevolution came along in the early 2000s, I was similarly swept up. I imagined\nwhen I chose to farm that the path would be lifelong. What I hadn\u2019t accounted\nfor, as a determined, starry-eyed changemaker, was the toll that a decade of\nfarming through wildfires, evacuations, floods, power outages, and a global\npandemic would take on my mental health.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I was happy working hard with my two feet planted firmly\non the land. In a better world I and people like Scott Chang-Fleeman would\nhave kept getting our hands dirty, making an honest, if modest, living\nproviding good and wholesome food in synch with the rhythms of the planet.\n\nBut to borrow a word from the world of ecology, being a young farmer in\ntoday\u2019s economy is \u201cunsustainable.\u201d The numbers don\u2019t work economically and,\neventually, any mind trying to square this un-squarable circle is going to\nbreak. The economic, physical and mental challenges are all interconnected.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find an American, Republican or Democrat, red or blue state\nresident that doesn\u2019t want more young hands on the land. We all rightly see\nagriculture as a pathway to personal fulfillment and a way to make our food\nsupply healthier and more secure. But words and intentions can only do so\nmuch. We must answer these very real problems with very real subsidy.\n\nIf we don\u2019t, my generation might be the last to think of going \u201cback-to-the-\nland\u201d as something actually worth doing.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * The 100 Most Influential People of 2024\n  * The Revolution of Yulia Navalnaya\n  * 6 Compliments That Land Every Time\n  * Stop Looking for Your Forever Home\n  * If You're Dating Right Now , You're Brave: Column\n  * The AI That Could Heal a Divided Internet\n  * Fallout Is a Brilliant Model for the Future of Video Game Adaptations\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
