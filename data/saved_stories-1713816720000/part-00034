But he wasn\u2019t eligible for a scholarship because he didn\u2019t know the\nlanguage. His friends studying in Taiwan connected him to their professors,\nwho offered him a scholarship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to get a scholarship in Taiwan. You just need your English\nproficiency test,\u201d Juliano, 23, told Rest of World. He\u2019s now in the second\nyear of a master\u2019s degree at the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University\n(NYCU) in Hsinchu, known as Taiwan\u2019s Silicon Valley.\n\nJuliano is among a growing number of students from Southeast Asia going for\ngraduate studies to Taiwan as the hype around artificial intelligence shines a\nspotlight on its semiconductor industry. For Taiwan, the world\u2019s top\nsemiconductor manufacturer, the interest of students like Juliano is welcome\nas it grapples with a severe talent shortage.\n\nWhile the industry worldwide faces a gap in the entire chip supply chain from\ndesign to manufacture, the scarcity is more consequential for Taiwan. Its\ncompanies produce most of the world\u2019s cutting-edge semiconductor chips that\ntech giants like Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm rely on, and the industry\ncontributes to about 15% of the island\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cAs Taiwanese semiconductor companies like TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor\nManufacturing Company] expand their operations, the need for skilled workers\nhas increased,\u201d Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, told\nRest of World. \u201cWithout sufficient talent, chip makers in Taiwan could face\ndelays in innovation and production,\u201d he said.\n\nNearly 23,000 jobs were available in the island\u2019s semiconductor industry every\nmonth in the second quarter of 2023, according to Taiwanese recruitment firm\n104 Job Bank. Though demand was down by more than a third compared to the\nprevious year\u2019s peak, the talent shortage remains \u201csignificant,\u201d the company\nnoted in its latest report.\n\nTaiwan chip makers have long relied on local talent, but that is no longer\nsufficient because of declining birth rates, lower enrollments in engineering\ncourses, and falling interest in jobs at fabrication facilities (known as\n\u201cfabs\u201d), according to Chih-Huang Lai, associate dean at the College of\nSemiconductor Research at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).\n\n\u201cWe have very good engineers who can be on standby 24 hours a day,\u201d Lai told\nRest of World. \u201cBut the younger generation, I don\u2019t think they really want to\ndo this anymore.\u201d\n\n> 15% The percentage of Taiwan\u2019s GDP made up by the semiconductor industry.\n\nAs Taiwan looks to fill the gap, \u201cit\u2019s no surprise\u201d that it is looking to\nSoutheast Asia, Jack Sun, dean of Industry Academia Innovation School, a chip\nacademy at NYCU, told Rest of World. The region has geographical proximity,\ngood school systems, and large ethnic Chinese populations, he said.\n\nAt the same time, Taiwanese semiconductor companies are also expanding in\nMalaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Singapore. \u201cSo these companies would love to\nhave more talent and engineers from the places where new fabs, new\nmanufacturing sites, design sites or testing sites are,\u201d said Sun, who retired\nas TSMC\u2019s chief technology officer in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a win-win\nsituation.\u201d\n\nCompetition for talent is heating up. There could be a gap of more than\n100,000 engineers each in the semiconductor sectors in the United States and\nEurope, and more than 200,000 in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding China,\naccording to a recent report from consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nThe Taiwan government is backing its companies in their search. Last year, the\nMinistry of Economic Affairs began organizing recruiting missions to Southeast\nAsia. Six chip companies, including TSMC, ASE Technology Holding, and\nMediaTek, joined the tours to Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,\nand Singapore. They recruited a total of 316 candidates to work or study in\nTaiwan \u2014 a \u201cvery good\u201d outcome, one of the organizers told Rest of World.\n\n\u201cThe Taiwanese government has been establishing cooperation with the Southeast\nAsian countries because we want to not rely on China,\u201d said the organizer,\nrequesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\nAnd the students were drawn to the \u201cmuch more attractive salaries compared to\ntheir home countries.\u201d\n\nUniversities in Taiwan have also been conducting research projects and student\nexchanges with their counterparts in Southeast Asia \u201cto build up our own\nconnections so we know how to reach the good students,\u201d Lai, at the\nsemiconductor college at NTHU, told Rest of World.\n\nThese efforts meant that in 2023\u201324, nearly a quarter of international\nstudents in higher learning in Taiwan were from Vietnam, about 14% from\nIndonesia, and 9% from Malaysia.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry faces continued talent shortages, which could\naffect innovation and production according to experts. Lam Yik Fei/The New\nYork Times/Redux\n\nTaiwan can benefit from the region\u2019s talent pool, \u201cpotentially easing labor\nshortages and scaling production capabilities,\u201d said Wang at Counterpoint\nResearch. \u201cIn return, these Southeast Asian countries could benefit from\ntechnology transfer, increased employment opportunities, and the upskilling of\ntheir workforce.\u201d\n\nFor instance, students from Malaysia have a long history of going to Taiwan\nfor higher studies, and more of them have been staying on to work in its\nsemiconductor manufacturing and engineering sectors, Eddie Chai, secretary of\nthe Federation of Alumni Association of Taiwan Universities, Malaysia, told\nRest of World.\n\n\u201cThe Taiwan government has loosened the work permit regulations,\u201d and the\nstarting salary for an engineering graduate with a master\u2019s degree is higher\nin Taiwan, Chai said.\n\nMalaysia is an established player in the back end of the semiconductor\nindustry, with facilities for assembly, testing, and packaging. As the country\ndraws more interest from global chip makers, \u201cthe Taiwanese hunt for talent in\nMalaysia is a positive development,\u201d said Chai. \u201cFor both the students and the\nindustry in Malaysia, as some may eventually bring that knowledge back to\nMalaysia.\u201d\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to compete for jobs because for most companies, you have to\n> speak Mandarin.\u201d\n\nStill, the number of students from Southeast Asia studying for degrees in\nsemiconductor-related fields in Taiwan remains modest. There have been about\n120 of them at NYCU over the past three years, or just 2% of all students in\nthis field; at NTHU, about 7% of students pursuing semiconductor-related\nmaster\u2019s degrees are from Southeast Asia, and about 2% at the PhD level.\n\nDespite Taiwan\u2019s efforts, the cultural similarity that is a draw can also be a\ndrawback. \u201cTop Vietnamese students prefer to study in the U.S. or Europe over\nAsia because they want to experience a different culture,\u201d Tran Xuan-Tu,\ndirector of the Information Technology Institute at Vietnam National\nUniversity, told Rest of World.\n\nLanguage can also be a barrier to securing a job. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to compete\nfor jobs because for most companies, you have to speak Mandarin,\u201d said Le Thi\nPhuong Thao, a Vietnamese student in her second year of a master\u2019s degree at\nNYCU.\n\nThao was a lab engineer at a company making airplane parts in Hanoi when she\nreceived a text from her former professors at Vietnam National University\u2019s\nmaterials science department where she did her undergraduate degree. They\nasked her to return for a two-year master\u2019s program in semiconductors on a\nfull scholarship, spending one year in Taiwan.\n\n\u201cI was in a job with no growth prospects. I saw that the [semiconductor] trend\nis growing, so I signed up,\u201d Thao, 24, told Rest of World. She is taking free\nMandarin classes available to international students, and hopes to land a job\nin Taiwan when she completes her program, or enroll for a PhD.\n\nFor Juliano, the Indonesian student, learning Mandarin has paid off: U.S. chip\nmaker Micron, which is stepping up production in Taiwan, made him a job offer\nthis week with \u201ca good salary and bonus,\u201d well before he graduates in February\n2025.\n\nJuliano doesn\u2019t plan to return to Indonesia any time soon. \u201cIn my country, we\ndon\u2019t have a semiconductor industry,\u201d he said.\n\nLam Le is a Labor x Tech reporting fellow at Rest of World based in Hanoi,\nVietnam.\n\nChong Pooi Koon is a reporter based in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nRead more stories\n\nSilicon Valley in Rest of World\n\nHow RRR\u2019s success brought a wave of Telugu-language movies to Netflix\n\nNetflix's U.S. catalog has more content in Telugu than in German, Russian, or\nany dialect of Chinese.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\nThe Rise of AI\n\nAI \u201cdeathbots\u201d are helping people in China grieve\n\nAvatars of deceased relatives are increasingly popular for consoling those in\nmourning, or hiding the deaths of loved ones from children.\n\nBy Viola Zhou\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nThe regional flavors of labor-on-demand\n\nA new report digs into the social dynamics of gig work.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": false}
