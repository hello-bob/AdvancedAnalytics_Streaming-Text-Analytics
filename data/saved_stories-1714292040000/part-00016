It said aid was being sent to the injured.The\nreport said that one of the reactors had been damaged in the accident, but\ngave no further details beyond saying that measures were being taken to\n\"eliminate the consequences of the accident\". It also claimed the accident was\nthe first at a Soviet power station.The report was the first confirmation of a\nmajor nuclear catastrophe since monitoring stations in Sweden, Finland and\nNorway began reporting sudden high discharges of radioactivity in the\natmosphere two days ago.MeltdownThe accident is believed to be the most\nserious in the history of nuclear power, worse even than that at the Three-\nMile Island power station in the United States in 1979, when there was some\nrelease of radioactivity but nobody was injured.The Chernobyl nuclear power\nplant, just north of Kiev, consists of four nuclear reactors, known as light-\nwater cooled, graphite-moderated reactors - a type hardly used outside the\nSoviet Union.Nuclear experts say the levels of radioactivity recorded indicate\nthat the nuclear core of the damaged reactor may have melted down.Full-scale\nalertThe number of casualties, both immediately and in the future, from\nradiation sickness, is expected to be high, although the exact number may\nnever be known. It is not believed, however, that there is any risk to the\nhealth of anyone outside the Soviet Union.The discharge of radioactivity was\nso great that by the time the fallout reached Sweden, 1,000 miles away, it was\nstill powerful enough to register twice the natural level of radioactivity in\nthe atmosphere.The sudden jump in radioactivity levels was enough to prompt a\nfull-scale alert in Sweden, which initially believed the accident had happened\nat its own nuclear power station, on the Baltic coast. The evacuation of 600\nworkers had been ordered before experts realised that the source of the\nradioactivity must have been within the Soviet Union.| E-mail this story to a\nfriend  \n---  \n  \n| Watch/Listen  \n---  \nThe Chernobyl power plant after the accident  \nSoviet Ambassador speaks to the press  \nReport on the problems faced in tackling the blaze  \nIn Context  \n---  \nChernobyl remains the world's worst civil nuclear disaster.It emerged that\ndesign flaws had led to a power surge, causing massive explosions which blew\nthe top off the reactor.Estimates of the numbers affected vary tremendously. A\nreport in 2005 by the Chernobyl Forum, set up by a number of bodies including\nthe World Health Organisation, the UN and governments of Belarus, the Russian\nFederation and Ukraine, concluded that fewer than 50 people, most of them\nworkers at the plant, died as a result of exposure to radiation. Most of them\ndied immediately after the disaster, but some survived until as late as\n2004.The forum estimates up to 9,000 people could eventually die from\nradiation exposure - although Greenpeace claims the figure could be much\nhigher, up to 93,000.The contamination spread across neighbouring Belarus, and\ninto Europe. In north Wales, sheep on some 350 farms still have to be tested\nfor radiation before their meat can be eaten.A concrete sarcophagus was\nhastily built to cover the damaged reactor, but it is weakening over time. It\nis due to be replaced in 2007.Chernobyl continued to produce electricity for\nanother 14 years, until international pressure forced its closure in 2000.An\nofficial exclusion zone around the plant remains in place, extending for 30\nkilometres (18 miles). It is one of the most radioactive spots on Earth.  \n  \nStories From 28 Apr1986: Soviets admit nuclear accident1996: Gunman runs amok\nin Tasmania1945: Italian partisans kill Mussolini1969: President Charles de\nGaulle resigns1994: CIA double agent jailed for life2001: First space tourist\nblasts off| BBC News >>  \n---  \n18 April 2006 Greenpeace rejects Chernobyl toll  \nChernobyl diary: part one  \nChernobyl diary: part two  \n2006: The Chernobyl nightmare revisited  \nYour memories  \n---  \nCaught in the fall-out How the Chernobyl disaster affected you  \n  \nSearch ON THIS DAY by date  \n---  \n^^ back to top  \n---  \nFront Page | Years | Themes | Witness  \n\u00a9MMVIII | News Sources | Privacy & Cookies Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
