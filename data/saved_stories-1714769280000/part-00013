It is a\nparticular favourite of tour guides, appears in castle guidebooks (Hodgson &\nWise 2015, 46) and interpretation panels (for example at Arundel Castle, West\nSussex), has been included in many popular texts (Mortimer 2009, 160), gets\nincorporated into television documentaries, is widely present in internet\narticles and is liberally recited by members of online discussion forums.\n\nOf all the stories connected to mediaeval buildings this is perhaps the one\nthat has been the most resilient. Unlike many other mediaeval tales that I\nhave researched there does not seem to be a shred of truth behind it. For some\nfolk this can be quite a controversial opinion. Attempting to gently puncture\nthe swordsman theory of spiral staircases gets a lot of pushback online. One\nreason for this might be the frequency of its repetition by parents to\nchildren. Whilst working at or visiting castles I inevitably hear a dad\nproudly imparting this knowledge to his little boy (and it usually is boys\u2019\ntalk) and it may be that this familial link creates a strong bond between the\nmyth and its proponents.\n\nCastle Studies Group site visit to Newark Castle (Nottinghamshire), April\n2019.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this blog post to outline all of the evidence against\nthe swordsman theory. That data will eventually appear in the content of a\nbook that I am working on looking at mediaeval building myths. However, before\nlooking in detail at how this myth developed it might be worth making seven\nbroad points:\n\n  1. The swordsman theory is predicated upon the belief that castles were intrinsically designed as military structures. Going back as far as the 1970s, and gaining widespread recognition in the 1990s, castle specialists have proposed that these buildings were primarily structures intended to be impressive theatrical backdrops for complex ceremonies relating to status and prestige. Secondly, they were lavish residences and only finally was there some consideration of fortification \u2013 which was often symbolic and rather ineffective. This is not to say that castles could not be used in times of warfare \u2013 demonstrably they were \u2013 but such moments were vanishingly rare (Liddiard 2005, 6-11; Johnson 2002, xiii-xix; Coulson 1979, 74). You can read more about the functions of castles in Mediaeval Mythbusting Blog #20: What is a Castle?\n  2. On the rare occasions when sieges did occur the chroniclers were keen to report them \u2013 disaster and death garnered readership in much the same way that it still does for modern media headline writers. Consequently, we know a fair bit about how sieges were ended, and it was never the desperate violent rout on the staircases that is so beloved of Hollywood films. The most common endings of sieges were starvation (Rochester, 1215; Kenilworth 1266), threats of punishment (Nottingham, 1194), bribery (Newark, 1218), blunders (Conwy 1401), or clever chicanery (Chateau Gaillard, 1204). If a rare siege resulted in fighting on the staircases then the game really was up.\n  3. There would be a sheer impracticality inherent to fighting on staircases. The stair at Colchester is so wide \u2013 5 metres in diameter \u2013 that it would not have impeded the swing of those travelling up or down the flight. Conversely, the stair in the great tower at Goodrich Castle has a claustrophobic diameter of just 0.7 metres. Such incredibly cramped spaces would not have allowed for the swinging of any weapons at all and, if fighting had ever occurred (which it didn\u2019t), short thrusting weapons may have been more practical. There is also the possibility that an upwards attacker may have had the advantage due to the vulnerability of the legs and nether regions of the defender, plus the uncertainty of balance caused by leaning over to fight in a downwards direction.\n  4. If staircases were genuinely engineered for military purposes, then we should always find that they turn clockwise. However, as scholars such as Neil Guy and Charles Ryder have demonstrated, there are a substantial minority of newels which turn anti-clockwise (approximately 30% of all surviving examples).\n  5. Critics point out that anti-clockwise newels are far more prevalent in late mediaeval castles \u2013 a time when it is commonly (and wrongly) assumed that defence was less paramount. However, there are many examples of anti-clockwise staircases in castles that were built during periods of conquest and war in hotly disputed territories. In the eleventh century, two of William the Bastard\u2019s conquest castles \u2013 Norwich and the Tower of London contain them. The following century buildings constructed during the period of the Anarchy, including Newark, have anti-clockwise newels. Meanwhile, examples built in the north at Helmsley and Richmond were vulnerable to Scottish incursions. During the thirteenth century conquest of Wales both Gilbert de Clare and Edward I patronised anti-clockwise newels in their castles at Caerphilly, Conwy, Beaumaris and Caernarfon.\n  6. Critics also try to claim that left-handed staircases are evidence that their patrons \u2013 such as a the Kerrs of Ferniehirst Castle \u2013 were pre-dominantly left-handed. This is also a myth and has been examined in Mediaeval Mythbusting Blog #24: Left-handed Kerrs.\n  7. The direction of a spiral staircase was an architectural decision, not a military one. The direction of the twist may be related to the practicality of carrying goods, the spatial considerations of access, or possibly even one-way systems of access. Ultimately, they were high status structures which allowed vertical movement between prestigious spaces in a castle. They are rarely found in lower status areas of castles, in civic defences or in the buildings of the militant orders. Spiral staircases in castles were intimately connected with access to the most prestigious spaces and were therefore a marker of status.\n\nTwelfth century anti-clockwise spiral staircase, Newark Castle\n(Nottinghamshire)\n\nDespite this, the swordsman theory is a vastly popular story \u2013 so much so that\nI wanted to try and trace its origins to better understand it. I began that\ntask under the assumption that it would probably first crop up in the writings\nof either eighteenth century antiquarians or nineteenth century military\nhistorians. Castles were a fairly late addition to archaeological research and\none of the very earliest people to look at this class of monument was the\nFrench architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc (1814-79). As a military engineer, who\nsaw active service during the siege of Paris, he should have been well-placed\nto advance the swordsman theory. However, in a 43 page discussion on the\nsubject Viollet-le-Duc concluded that spiral staircases were \u2018only a means of\nreaching the upper floors of a dwelling.\u2019\n\nInstead, the earliest citation of the swordsman theory that I have been able\nto determine is in the writings of an English art critic by the name of Sir\nTheodore Andrea Cook (1867-1929). Cook first incorporated the story in his\n1902 essay on spiral staircases entitled The Shell of Leonardo (Cook 1902,\n106). This was then reprinted the following year as a chapter in his book\nSpirals in Nature and Art:\n\n\u2018\u2018It is worth observing, however, at this stage of our inquiry, that while it\nwas easier and more natural for a right-handed architect to draw plans for a\nstaircase with a right-handed spiral, this \u201cleiotropic\u201d formation is not\ninvariably better; for a man ascending it and turning perpetually to the left\nwould always have his right hand free to attack the defenders, and the\ngarrison coming down would expose their left hands on the outside.\u2019\n\nSir Theodore Andrea Cook (Picture Source: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nCook ruminated that a right-handed architect would automatically wish to\ndesign an anti-clockwise stair so that the right hand would always be furthest\naway from the newel post whilst ascending. However, in his mind, this would\nhave afforded a right-handed attacker the advantage over defenders who would\nfind the swing of their weapons cramped. Correspondingly, his belief was that\nthe designers of castles went against their natural instincts so as to\nfacilitate a better defensive scheme.\n\nAspects of Cook\u2019s life and interests may explain why he may have come to this\nconclusion. The subject matter of his 1903 book \u2013 spirals \u2013 immediately\nfocused his mind towards staircases. His writing also betrays a powerful\ncuriosity about which hand was favoured by significant individuals from both\nhistory and his own era. In particular, he was taken with the notion that\nleft-handed people were excessively talented in their chosen fields including\nthe Benjamite sling-shotters from the Bible, Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Holbein\nand the French Olympian fencers Lucien M\u00e9rignac and Alphonse Kirchhoffer.\n\nThe reason for his focus on these obscure French fencers is that he was\nhimself a man absolutely obsessed with the sport. He set up the Oxford\nUniversity Fencing Club in 1891, wrote a fencing column for the Daily\nTelegraph (under the pseudonym Old Blue), served on the committee of the\nAmateur Fencing Association (1904-1928) and the council of the British Olympic\nAssociation from 1905 until 1920. Given his triple interests in swordsmanship,\nthe hand which men favoured and the bearing of a spiral\u2019s turn, Cook was in a\nunique position to make a connection between the three. He may have been the\nfirst to offer an original explanation as to why most castle staircases turned\nin a clockwise direction.\n\nCook pictured with fencing colleagues (Picture Source: Theodore Cook, 1908,\nThe Cruise of Branwen)\n\nIf there is an earlier citation than Cook\u2019s, then it failed to make an impact.\nWithin a decade the writer Guy Cadogan Rothery (1912, 51-52) had repeated the\nswordsman theory and specifically referenced Cook in his bibliography. It was\nthen absorbed into popular books on castles by the author Sidney Toy (1939,\n208; 1954, 255) and by the mid-twentieth century it had become widespread\naccepted knowledge. This was no doubt helped along by on-screen portrayals of\nsword fights on spiral staircases including those in The Adventures of Robin\nHood (1938) and The Princess Bride (1987).\n\nAs the origins of the story have been largely forgotten it still has many\nadvocates. During January 2020 it was uncritically repeated by none other than\nEnglish Heritage \u2013 the country\u2019s foremost curator of mediaeval castles.\nHowever, of late, I have been heartened to see a fair number of people on the\nMedieval Buildings Group discussion forum challenging repetitions of the myth.\nThis can be contrasted with a prolonged debate on another forum \u2013 British\nMedieval History \u2013 just four years ago where I was very much a lone voice\nagainst the tide of the swordsman theory.\n\nI do not doubt that the myth will continue to be recited, but its origins seem\nto be relatively recent \u2013 the probable source may have been the art critic and\ninveterate fencer Sir Theodore Andrea Cook.\n\n* The actual shape described by such staircases is a helix. However, they are mostly referred to as spiral stairs so, for clarity, I have followed common English usage.\n\nReferences\n\nCook, T.
