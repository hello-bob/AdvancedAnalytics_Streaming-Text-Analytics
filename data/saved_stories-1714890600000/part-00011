Chronometer circa 1844-1860.  \nClassification| Clock  \nIndustry| Transportation  \nApplication| Timekeeping  \nPowered| No  \nInventor| John Harrison  \nInvented| 1761  \n  \nA marine chronometer is a precision timepiece that is carried on a ship and\nemployed in the determination of the ship's position by celestial navigation.\nIt is used to determine longitude by comparing Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), and\nthe time at the current location found from observations of celestial bodies.\nWhen first developed in the 18th century, it was a major technical\nachievement, as accurate knowledge of the time over a long sea voyage was\nvital for effective navigation, lacking electronic or communications aids. The\nfirst true chronometer was the life work of one man, John Harrison, spanning\n31 years of persistent experimentation and testing that revolutionized naval\n(and later aerial) navigation.\n\nThe term chronometer was coined from the Greek words \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (chronos) (meaning\ntime) and meter (meaning measure). The 1713 book Physico-Theology by the\nEnglish cleric and scientist William Derham includes one of the earliest\ntheoretical descriptions of a marine chronometer.^[1] It has recently become\nmore commonly used to describe watches tested and certified to meet certain\nprecision standards.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe marine \"Chronometer\" of Jeremy Thacker used gimbals and a vacuum in a bell\njar.\n\nFurther information: History of longitude\n\nTo determine a position on the Earth's surface, it is necessary and sufficient\nto know the latitude, longitude, and altitude. Altitude considerations can\nnaturally be ignored for vessels operating at sea level. Until the mid-1750s,\naccurate navigation at sea out of sight of land was an unsolved problem due to\nthe difficulty in calculating longitude. Navigators could determine their\nlatitude by measuring the sun's angle at noon (i.e., when it reached its\nhighest point in the sky, or culmination) or, in the Northern Hemisphere, by\nmeasuring the angle of Polaris (the North Star) from the horizon (usually\nduring twilight). To find their longitude, however, they needed a time\nstandard that would work aboard a ship. Observation of regular celestial\nmotions, such as Galileo's method based on observing Jupiter's natural\nsatellites, was usually not possible at sea due to the ship's motion. The\nlunar distances method, initially proposed by Johannes Werner in 1514, was\ndeveloped in parallel with the marine chronometer. The Dutch scientist Gemma\nFrisius was the first to propose the use of a chronometer to determine\nlongitude in 1530.\n\nThe purpose of a chronometer is to measure accurately the time of a known\nfixed location. This is particularly important for navigation. As the Earth\nrotates at a regular predictable rate, the time difference between the\nchronometer and the ship's local time can be used to calculate the longitude\nof the ship relative to the Prime Meridian (defined as 0\u00b0) (or another\nstarting point) if accurately enough known, using spherical trigonometry.\nPractical celestial navigation usually requires a marine chronometer to\nmeasure time, a sextant to measure the angles, an almanac^[2] giving schedules\nof the coordinates of celestial objects, a set of sight reduction tables to\nhelp perform the height and azimuth computations, and a chart of the region.\nWith sight reduction tables, the only calculations required are addition and\nsubtraction. Most people can master simpler celestial navigation procedures\nafter a day or two of instruction and practice, even using manual calculation\nmethods. The use of a marine chronometer to determine longitude by chronometer\npermits navigators to obtain a reasonably accurate position fix.^[3] For every\nfour seconds that the time source is in error, the east\u2013west position may be\noff by up to just over one nautical mile as the angular speed of Earth is\nlatitude dependent.^[4]\n\nThe creation of a timepiece which would work reliably at sea was difficult.\nUntil the 20th century, the best timekeepers were pendulum clocks, but both\nthe rolling of a ship at sea and the up to 0.2% variations in the gravity of\nEarth made a simple gravity-based pendulum useless both in theory and in\npractice.\n\n### First examples[edit]\n\nHenry Sully (1680-1729) presented a first marine chronometer in 1716\n\nChristiaan Huygens, following his invention of the pendulum clock in 1656,\nmade the first attempt at a marine chronometer in 1673 in France, under the\nsponsorship of Jean-Baptiste Colbert.^[5]^[6] In 1675, Huygens, who was\nreceiving a pension from Louis XIV, invented a chronometer that employed a\nbalance wheel and a spiral spring for regulation, instead of a pendulum,\nopening the way to marine chronometers and modern pocket watches and\nwristwatches. He obtained a patent for his invention from Colbert, but his\nclock remained imprecise at sea.^[7] Huygens' attempt in 1675 to obtain an\nEnglish patent from Charles II stimulated Robert Hooke, who claimed to have\nconceived of a spring-driven clock years earlier, to attempt to produce one\nand patent it. During 1675 Huygens and Hooke each delivered two such devices\nto Charles, but none worked well and neither Huygens nor Hooke received an\nEnglish patent. It was during this work that Hooke formulated Hooke's law.^[8]\n\nJohn Harrison's H1 marine chronometer of 1735\n\nThe first published use of the term chronometer was in 1684 in Arcanum\nNavarchicum, a theoretical work by Kiel professor Matthias Wasmuth. This was\nfollowed by a further theoretical description of a chronometer in works\npublished by English scientist William Derham in 1713. Derham's principal\nwork, Physico-theology, or a demonstration of the being and attributes of God\nfrom his works of creation, also proposed the use of vacuum sealing to ensure\ngreater accuracy in the operation of clocks.^[9] Attempts to construct a\nworking marine chronometer were begun by Jeremy Thacker in England in 1714,\nand by Henry Sully in France two years later. Sully published his work in 1726\nwith Une Horloge invent\u00e9e et execut\u00e9e par M. Sulli, but neither his nor\nThacker's models were able to resist the rolling of the seas and keep precise\ntime while in shipboard conditions.^[10]\n\nDrawings of Harrison's H4 chronometer of 1761, published in The principles of\nMr Harrison's time-keeper, 1767.^[11]\n\nIn 1714, the British government offered a longitude prize for a method of\ndetermining longitude at sea, with the awards ranging from \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000\n(\u00a32 million to \u00a34 million in 2024 terms) depending on accuracy. John Harrison,\na Yorkshire carpenter, submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a\nclock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by\nsprings whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship.\nHis first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system,\nbut he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to centrifugal force,\nwhich meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea. Construction of\nhis third machine, designated H3, in 1759 included novel circular balances and\nthe invention of the bi-metallic strip and caged roller bearings, inventions\nwhich are still widely used. However, H3's circular balances still proved too\ninaccurate and he eventually abandoned the large machines.^[12]\n\nFerdinand Berthoud's marine chronometer no.3, 1763\n\nHarrison solved the precision problems with his much smaller H4 chronometer\ndesign in 1761. H4 looked much like a large five-inch (12 cm) diameter pocket\nwatch. In 1761, Harrison submitted H4 for the \u00a320,000 longitude prize. His\ndesign used a fast-beating balance wheel controlled by a temperature-\ncompensated spiral spring. These features remained in use until stable\nelectronic oscillators allowed very accurate portable timepieces to be made at\naffordable cost. In 1767, the Board of Longitude published a description of\nhis work in The Principles of Mr. Harrison's time-keeper.^[13] A French\nexpedition under Charles-Fran\u00e7ois-C\u00e9sar Le Tellier de Montmirail performed the\nfirst measurement of longitude using marine chronometers aboard Aurore in\n1767.^[14]\n\n### Further development[edit]\n\nPierre Le Roy marine chronometer, 1766, photographed at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et\nM\u00e9tiers in Paris\n\nIn France, 1748, Pierre Le Roy invented the detent escapement characteristic\nof modern chronometers.^[15] In 1766, he created a revolutionary chronometer\nthat incorporated a detent escapement, the temperature-compensated balance and\nthe isochronous balance spring:^[16] Harrison showed the possibility of having\na reliable chronometer at sea, but these developments by Le Roy are considered\nby Rupert Gould to be the foundation of the modern chronometer.^[16] Le Roy's\ninnovations made the chronometer a much more accurate piece than had been\nanticipated.^[17]\n\nHarrison's Chronometer H5 of 1772, now on display at the Science Museum,\nLondon\n\nFerdinand Berthoud in France, as well as Thomas Mudge in Britain also\nsuccessfully produced marine timekeepers.^[15] Although none were simple, they\nproved that Harrison's design was not the only answer to the problem. The\ngreatest strides toward practicality came at the hands of Thomas Earnshaw and\nJohn Arnold, who in 1780 developed and patented simplified, detached, \"spring\ndetent\" escapements,^[18]^[19] moved the temperature compensation to the\nbalance, and improved the design and manufacturing of balance springs. This\ncombination of innovations served as the basis of marine chronometers until\nthe electronic era.\n\nFerdinand Berthoud chronometer no. 24 (1782), on display at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts\net M\u00e9tiers, Paris\n\nThe new technology was initially so expensive that not all ships carried\nchronometers, as illustrated by the fateful last journey of the East Indiaman\nArniston, shipwrecked with the loss of 372 lives.^[20] However, by 1825, the\nRoyal Navy had begun routinely supplying its vessels with chronometers.^[21]\n\nBeginning in 1820, the British Royal Observatory in Greenwich tested marine\nchronometers in an Admiralty instigated trial or \"chronometer competition\"\nprogram intended to encourage the improvement of chronometers. In 1840 a new\nseries of trials in a different format was begun by the seventh Astronomer\nRoyal George Biddell Airy. These trials continued in much the same format\nuntil the outbreak of World War I in 1914, at which point they were suspended.\nAlthough the formal trials ceased, the testing of chronometers for the Royal\nNavy did not.^[22]^[23]\n\nMarine chronometer makers looked to a phalanx of astronomical observatories\nlocated in Western Europe to conduct accuracy assessments of their timepieces.\nOnce mechanical timepiece movements developed sufficient precision to allow\nfor adequately accurate marine navigation, these third party independent\nassessments also developed into what became known as \"chronometer\ncompetitions\" at the astronomical observatories located in Western Europe. The\nNeuch\u00e2tel Observatory, Geneva Observatory, Besan\u00e7on Observatory, Kew\nObservatory, German Naval Observatory Hamburg and Glash\u00fctte Observatory are\nprominent examples of observatories that certified the accuracy of mechanical\ntimepieces. The observatory testing regime typically lasted for 30 to 50 days\nand contained accuracy standards that were far more stringent and difficult\nthan modern standards such as those set by the Contr\u00f4le Officiel Suisse des\nChronom\u00e8tres (COSC). When a movement passed the observatory test, it became\ncertified as an observatory chronometer and received a Bulletin de Marche from\nthe observatory, stipulating the performance of the movement.\n\nIt was common for ships at the time to observe a time ball, such as the one at\nthe Royal Observatory, Greenwich, to check their chronometers before departing\non a long voyage. Every day, ships would anchor briefly in the River Thames at\nGreenwich, waiting for the ball at the observatory to drop at precisely\n1pm.^[24] This practice was in small part responsible for the subsequent\nadoption of Greenwich Mean Time as an international standard.^[25] (Time balls\nbecame redundant around 1920 with the introduction of radio time signals,\nwhich have themselves largely been superseded by GPS time.) In addition to\nsetting their time before departing on a voyage, ship chronometers were also\nroutinely checked for accuracy while at sea by carrying out lunar^[26] or\nsolar observations.^[27] In typical use, the chronometer would be mounted in a\nsheltered location below decks to avoid damage and exposure to the elements.\nMariners would use the chronometer to set a so-called hack watch, which would\nbe carried on deck to make the astronomical observations. Though much less\naccurate (and less expensive) than the chronometer, the hack watch would be\nsatisfactory for a short period of time after setting it (i.e., long enough to\nmake the observations).\n\n### Rationalizing production methods[edit]\n\nEinheitschronometer pattern MX6 marine chronometer mass-produced in the Soviet\nUnion after World War IIInner working of the Hamilton Model 21 marine\nchronometer mass-produced in the United States during and after World War II\n\nAlthough industrial production methods began revolutionizing watchmaking in\nthe middle of the 19th century, chronometer manufacture remained craft-based\nmuch longer and was dominated by British and Swiss manufacturers. Around the\nturn of the 20th century, Swiss makers such as Ulysse Nardin made great\nstrides toward incorporating modern production methods and using fully\ninterchangeable parts, but it was only with the onset of World War II that the\nHamilton Watch Company in the United States perfected the process of mass\nproduction, which enabled it to produce thousands of its Hamilton Model 21 and\nModel 22 chronometers from 1942 onwards for the branches of the United States\nmilitary and merchant marine as well as other Allied forces during World War\nII. The Hamilton 21 Marine Chronometer had a chain drive fusee and its second\nhand advanced in 1\u20442-second increments over a 60 seconds marked sub dial. In\nGermany, where marine chronometers were imported or used foreign key\ncomponents, a Drei-Pfeiler Werk Einheitschronometer (three-pillar movement\nunified chronometer) was developed by a collaboration between the Wempe\nChronometerwerke and A. Lange & S\u00f6hne companies to make more efficient\nproduction possible. The development of a precise and inexpensive\nEinheitschronometer was a 1939 German naval command and Aviation ministry\ndriven initiative. Serial production began in 1942. All parts were made in\nGermany and interchangeable.^[28] During the course of World War II\nmodifications that became necessary when raw materials became scarce were\napplied and work was compulsory and sometimes voluntarily shared between\nvarious German manufacturers to speed up production. The production of German\nunified design chronometers with their harmonized components continued until\nlong after World War II in Germany and the Soviet Union, who confiscated the\noriginal Einheitschronometer technical drawings, and set up a production line\nin Moscow in 1949 that produced the first Soviet MX6 chronometers containing\nGerman made movements.^[29] From 1952 onwards until 1997 MX6 chronometers with\nminor \u041d\u0418\u0418 \u0427\u0410\u0421\u041f\u0420\u041e\u041c (NII Chasprom \u2014 Horological institute of the Soviet era)\ndevised alterations were produced from components all made in the Soviet\nUnion.^[30] The German Einheitschronometer ultimately became the mechanical\nmarine timekeeper design produced in the highest volume, with about 58,000\nunits produced. Of these, less than 3,000 were produced during World War II,\nabout 5,000 after the war in West and East Germany and about 50,000 in the\nSoviet Union and later post-Soviet Russia.^[31] Of the Hamilton 21 Marine\nChronometer during and after World War II about 13,000 units were produced.\nDespite the Einheitschronometer and Hamilton's success, chronometers made in\nthe old way never disappeared from the marketplace during the era of\nmechanical timekeepers. Thomas Mercer Chronometers was among the companies\nthat continued to make them.\n\n### Historical significance[edit]\n\nMechanical boxed Marine Chronometer used on Queen Victoria's royal yacht HMY\nVictoria and Albert, made about 1865\n\nShip\u2019s marine chronometers are the most exact portable mechanical timepieces\never produced and in a static environment were only trumped by non-portable\nprecision pendulum clocks for observatories. They served, alongside the\nsextant, to determine the location of ships at sea. The seafaring nations\ninvested richly in the development of these precision instruments, as\npinpointing location at sea gave a decisive naval advantage. Without their\naccuracy and the accuracy of the feats of navigation that marine chronometers\nenabled, it is arguable that the ascendancy of the Royal Navy, and by\nextension that of the British Empire, might not have occurred so\noverwhelmingly; the formation of the empire by wars and conquests of colonies\nabroad took place in a period in which British vessels had reliable navigation\ndue to the chronometer, while their Portuguese, Dutch, and French opponents\ndid not.^[32] For example: the French were well established in India and other\nplaces before Britain, but were defeated by naval forces in the Seven Years'\nWar.\n\nRating and maintaining marine chronometers was deemed important well into the\n20th century, as after World War I the work of the British Royal Observatory\u2019s\nChronometer Department became largely confined to rating of chronometers and\nwatches that the Admiralty already owned and providing acceptance\ntesting.^[33]^[34] In 1937 a workshop was set up for the first time by the\nTime Department for the repair and adjustment of British armed forces issued\nchronometers and watches. These maintenance activities had previously been\noutsourced to commercial workshops.^[35]\n\nFrom about the 1960s onwards mechanical spring detent marine chronometers were\ngradually replaced and supplanted by chronometers based on electric\nengineering techniques and technologies.^[36] In 1985 the British Ministry of\nDefence invited bids by tender for the disposal of their mechanical Hamilton\nModel 21 Marine Chronometers. The US Navy kept their Hamilton Model 21 Marine\nChronometers in service as backups to the Loran-C hyperbolic radio navigation\nsystem until 1988, when the GPS global navigation satellite system was\napproved as reliable. At the end of the 20th century the production of\nmechanical marine chronometers had declined to the point where only a few were\nbeing made to special order by the First Moscow Watch Factory 'Kirov' (Poljot)\nin Russia, Wempe in Germany and Mercer in England.^[37]\n\nThe most complete international collection of marine chronometers, including\nHarrison's H1 to H4, is at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in London, UK.\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\nA chronometer mechanism diagrammed (text is in German). Note fusee to\ntransform varying spring tension to a constant forceEinheitschronometer\npattern marine chronometer (A. Lange & S\u00f6hne, 1948) displaying its second hand\nadvancing in 1\u20442-second increments over a 60 seconds marked sub dial for\noptimal timing of celestial objects angle measurements at the GFZ\n\nThe crucial problem was to find a resonator that remained unaffected by the\nchanging conditions met by a ship at sea. The balance wheel, harnessed to a\nspring, solved most of the problems associated with the ship's motion.\nUnfortunately, the elasticity of most balance spring materials changes\nrelative to temperature. To compensate for ever-changing spring strength, the\nmajority of chronometer balances used bi-metallic strips to move small weights\ntoward and away from the centre of oscillation, thus altering the period of\nthe balance to match the changing force of the spring. The balance spring\nproblem was solved with a nickel-steel alloy named Elinvar for its invariable\nelasticity at normal temperatures. The inventor was Charles \u00c9douard Guillaume,\nwho won the 1920 Nobel Prize for physics in recognition for his metallurgical\nwork.\n\nThe escapement serves two purposes. First, it allows the train to advance\nfractionally and record the balance's oscillations. At the same time, it\nsupplies minute amounts of energy to counter tiny losses from friction, thus\nmaintaining the momentum of the oscillating balance. The escapement is the\npart that ticks. Since the natural resonance of an oscillating balance serves\nas the heart of a chronometer, chronometer escapements are designed to\ninterfere with the balance as little as possible. There are many constant-\nforce and detached escapement designs, but the most common are the spring\ndetent and pivoted detent. In both of these, a small detent locks the escape\nwheel and allows the balance to swing completely free of interference except\nfor a brief moment at the centre of oscillation, when it is least susceptible\nto outside influences. At the centre of oscillation, a roller on the balance\nstaff momentarily displaces the detent, allowing one tooth of the escape wheel\nto pass. The escape wheel tooth then imparts its energy on a second roller on\nthe balance staff. Since the escape wheel turns in only one direction, the\nbalance receives impulse in only one direction. On the return oscillation, a\npassing spring on the tip of the detent allows the unlocking roller on the\nstaff to move by without displacing the detent. The weakest link of any\nmechanical timekeeper is the escapement's lubrication. When the oil thickens\nthrough age or temperature or dissipates through humidity or evaporation, the\nrate will change, sometimes dramatically as the balance motion decreases\nthrough higher friction in the escapement. A detent escapement has a strong\nadvantage over other escapements as it needs no lubrication. An impulse from\nthe escape wheel to the impulse roller is nearly dead-beat, meaning little\nsliding action needing lubrication. Chronometer escape wheels and passing\nsprings are typically gold due to the metal's lower slide friction over brass\nand steel.\n\nChronometers often included other innovations to increase their efficiency and\nprecision. Hard stones such as ruby and sapphire were often used as jewel\nbearings to decrease friction and wear of the pivots and escapement. Diamond\nwas often used as the cap stone for the lower balance staff pivot to prevent\nwear from years of the heavy balance turning on the small pivot end. Until the\nend of mechanical chronometer production in the third quarter of the 20th\ncentury, makers continued to experiment with things like ball bearings and\nchrome-plated pivots.\n\nThe timepieces were normally protected from the elements and kept below decks\nin a fixed position in a traditional box suspended in gimbals (a set of rings\nconnected by bearings). This keeps the chronometer isolated in a horizontal\n\"dial up\" position to counter ship inclination (rocking) movements induced\ntiming errors on the balance wheel.\n\nMarine chronometers always contain a maintaining power which keeps the\nchronometer going while it is being wound, and a power reserve indicator to\nshow how long the chronometer will continue to run without being wound.\n\nThese technical provisions usually yield timekeeping in mechanical marine\nchronometers accurate to within 0.5 second per day.^[38]^[39]\n\n## Chronometer rating[edit]\n\nIn strictly horological terms, \"rating\" a chronometer means that prior to the\ninstrument entering service, the average rate of gaining or losing per day is\nobserved and recorded on a rating certificate which accompanies the\ninstrument. This daily rate is used in the field to correct the time indicated\nby the instrument to get an accurate time reading. Even the best-made\nchronometer with the finest temperature compensation etc. exhibits two types\nof error, (1) random and (2) consistent. The quality of design and manufacture\nof the instrument keeps the random errors small. In principle, the consistent\nerrors should be amenable to elimination by adjustment, but in practice it is\nnot possible to make the adjustment so precisely that this error is completely\neliminated, so the technique of rating is used. The rate will also change\nwhile the instrument is in service due to e.g. thickening of the oil, so on\nlong expeditions the instrument's rate would be periodically checked against\naccurate time determined by astronomical observations.\n\n## Marine chronometer use today[edit]\n\nOmega 4.19 MHz (4194304 = 2^22 high frequency quartz resonator) Ships Marine\nChronometer giving an autonomous accuracy of less than \u00b1 5 seconds per year,\nFrench Navy issued, 1980. The second hand can advance in 1\u20442-second increments\nfor optimal timing of celestial objects' angle measurements.\n\nSince the 1990s boats and ships can use several Global Navigation Satellite\nSystems (GNSS) to navigate all the world's lakes, seas and oceans. Maritime\nGNSS units include functions useful on water, such as \"man overboard\" (MOB)\nfunctions that allow instantly marking the location where a person has fallen\noverboard, which simplifies rescue efforts. GNSS may be connected to the\nship's self-steering gear and Chartplotters using the NMEA 0183 interface, and\ncan also improve the security of shipping traffic by enabling Automatic\nIdentification Systems (AIS).\n\nEven with these convenient 21st-century technological tools, modern practical\nnavigators usually use celestial navigation using electric-powered time\nsources in combination with satellite navigation.^[40] Small handheld\ncomputers, laptops, navigational calculators and even scientific calculators\nenable modern navigators to \"reduce\" sextant sights in minutes, by automating\nall the calculation and/or data lookup steps.^[41] Using multiple independent\nposition fix methods without solely relying on subject-to-failure electronic\nsystems helps the navigator detect errors. Professional mariners are still\nrequired to be proficient in traditional piloting and celestial navigation,\nwhich requires the use of a precisely adjusted and rated autonomous or\nperiodically external time-signal corrected chronometer.^[42] These abilities\nare still a requirement for certain international mariner certifications such\nas Officer in Charge of Navigational Watch, and Master and Chief Mate deck\nofficers,^[43]^[44] and supplements offshore yachtmasters on long-distance\nprivate cruising yachts.^[45]\n\nModern marine chronometers can be based on quartz clocks that are corrected\nperiodically by satellite time signals or radio time signals (see radio\nclock). These quartz chronometers are not always the most accurate quartz\nclocks when no signal is received, and their signals can be lost or blocked.\nHowever, there are autonomous quartz movements, even in wrist watches, that\nare accurate to within 5 or 20 seconds per year.^[46] At least one quartz\nchronometer made for advanced navigation utilizes multiple quartz crystals\nwhich are corrected by a computer using an average value, in addition to GPS\ntime signal corrections.^[47]^[48]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Celestial navigation\n  * Sextant\n  * Clockmaker\n  * Thomas Earnshaw, inventor of the standard chronometer escapement\n  * Larcum Kendall\n  * Noon Gun\n  * Time ball\n  * Time signal\n  * Railroad chronometer\n  * Rupert Gould, author of an important history of the marine chronometer\n  * Radio-controlled watch\n  * Watchmaker\n  * Timeline of invention\n  * Longitude (book)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Koberer, Wolfgang (May 2016). \"Notes: On the First Use of the Term \"Chronometer\"=\".
