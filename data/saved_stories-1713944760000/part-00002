It can be regarded as an application\ndevelopment environment where an application designer creates the database\nstructure and user interface, and users of the application enter and process\ndata on a regular basis.\n\nThere are numerous applications for BeeBase including managing addresses,\nmusic and movies, photo collections, your family tree, or your income and\nexpense. Some users run their entire business using BeeBase from project\nplanning to creating offers, article and part management, creating bills and\ninvoices, and tracking their finances.\n\nThe strength of BeeBase lies in its graphical user interface and its\nprogramming capabilities. It allows you to process data in various ways, e.g.\nautomatic calculations upon user input, generation of reports, import and\nexport of data, etc. For example BeeBase can be used for calculating the total\namount of income, or the total amount of recorded time on a CD, or to\nautomatically create and print serial letters to your customers.\n\nBeeBase is the successor of MUIbase whose development originally started on an\nAmiga in the year 1994.\n\nBeeBase \u00a9 2024 Steffen Gutmann, web presentation by St\u00e9phane Aulery and Ralph\nReuchlein\n\n", "frontpage": true}
