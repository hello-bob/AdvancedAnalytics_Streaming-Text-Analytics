This post is\nslightly different. I want to share what I think is the most important trait\nof a successful startup. By trait I mean a cultural characteristic \u2013 a way of\ndoing things. A company personality.\n\nI believe the most important trait of exceptional startups is intensity.\n\nNot intelligence, charisma, or positivity, although these three traits are\nrequired.\n\nWhy do I believe this?\n\nThe first reason I believe this is observation. I have been a part of 3\nexceptional startups, and each of them had a culture of intensity, with the\nmost intense being the most successful. I have also observed this across\ndozens of other startups \u2013 those who end up breaking out operate with a very\nhigh level of intensity.\n\nThe second reason I believe this is logic. If you consider how impossible the\nstartup journey is, it stands to reason that only through intensity can\nsomething be created out of thin air that grows to be worth billions of\ndollars in just a few years. Startups are dead by default. And yet a small\nnumber of them overcome that certain death to build something enduring.\nCertainly such large outcomes don\u2019t come about through happenstance \u2013 it is\nthrough the focused, intense effort of a group of people that something like\nthat can happen.\n\nJohn Collison\u2019s tweet resonates, although he uses tenacity and passion to\ndescribe something similar:\n\nThe third reason I believe this is because of what I have learned by studying\nsome of startups most successful founders and operators. A few examples:\n\n  * Steve Jobs was described as intense by Pixar\u2019s CFO in the early days:\n  * Warren Buffett once said: \u201cIntensity is the price of excellence.\u201d\n  * Frank Slootman\u2019s quote:\n\n  * Paul Graham describing the Airbnb founders:\n\n  * Jason Lemkin\u2019s observation:\n\n  * The Elon Musk biography had a clear theme of intensity as a core driver of Elon\u2019s success, with dozens of examples in the book.\n  * Sam Altman\u2019s view:\n\n  * Walt Disney description:\n\nWorth noting: the people above have different personalities. Yes, Steve Jobs\nand Elon Musk are abrasive, often accused of being ass holes. But few people\nwould say that about Brian Chesky, Sam Altman, and John Collison. Yet they are\nall intense, even though each has a different personality.\n\nWhen I shared this observation about intensity on LinkedIn, several people\nasked me to share more about what I meant, so I will end with that.\n\nIntense is an adjective meant to convey a high or extreme degree of something.\nThis means that intensity is a layer across all other characteristics. A force\nmultiplier \u2013 a measurement of extremism.\n\n  * Not all fires are intense, but we know an intense fire when we feel and see it.\n  * Not all work ethic is intense, but we know an intense work ethic when we see it.\n  * Not all communication is intense, but we know intense communication when we hear it.\n  * Not all missions are intense, but we know intense missions when we hear and live them.\n\nPerhaps the best summary of what I mean by intensity is Frank Slootman\u2019s\nperformance culture:\n\n  1. Raise the quality bar\n  2. Increase the speed\n  3. Narrow the focus\n\nDoing all of these things to an intense degree is what I mean by intensity.\n\nMost startups care about quality, but not intensely. They want to increase\nspeed, but not intensely. They think focus is important, but they don\u2019t focus\nintensely.\n\nMost people want to live, but not intensely.\n\nBut without intensity, great startups (and I would argue, great lives) cannot\nbe built.\n\n### Related\n\nElements of Exceptional StartupsSeptember 7, 2023Liked by 2 people\n\nStartup Spiritual Conversion June 30, 2023Liked by 3 people\n\nWhat I Learned From Peter FentonMarch 20, 2024In \"business\"\n\n### About the author\n\n### Always Happy; Never Satisfied\n\n-Husband & Dad in A Tribe Called Hogge\n\nAlways Happy; Never SatisfiedAuthor website\n\n### About the post\n\nUncategorized\n\nbusiness, startups, tech, vc\n\nBlog at WordPress.com. .
