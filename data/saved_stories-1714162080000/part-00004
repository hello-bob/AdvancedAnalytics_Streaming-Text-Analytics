But there were no EV\nchargers in the shared car park in his public housing estate, so he had to\nimprovise.\n\n\u201cThere were some fast chargers near my home, so I would charge my car while I\nhad a meal or shopped,\u201d Koh, 33, who drove for a ride-hailing firm then, told\nRest of World.\n\nTo ease the transition for drivers like Koh, and convince more of the\ncountry\u2019s more than half a million car owners to switch to EVs, Singapore\nplans to install 60,000 charging points by 2030, including 40,000 in public\ncar parks. That works out to an EV to charger ratio of about 5-to-1, putting\nthe country in the lead for charging infrastructure in Southeast Asia. It also\nputs Singapore ahead of the global average ratio of 10-to-1, and 7-to-1 in\nChina, the top market for EVs.\n\nSingapore has vowed to reduce its land transport emissions to help reach its\ngoal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Authorities have said they will end\nsales of new cars with internal combustion engines from 2030, with plans to\nphase them out entirely by 2040. Having adequate chargers \u2014 alongside lowering\nthe cost of buying and owning an EV \u2014 is critical to this plan.\n\nInadequate EV charging stations are a problem in many countries, particularly\nin Singapore, where about 80% of the population lives in high-rise public\nhousing with multi-story car parks, Muhammad Rafey Khan, an analyst at\nconsultancy Power Technology Research, told Rest of World. \u201cThis is relatively\ncomplex when compared to countries where there are houses with separate\ngarages and parking spaces, and they can privately install chargers,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the government has a plan. The aim is for every car park owned by the\nHousing Development Board (HDB), Singapore\u2019s public housing agency, to \u201cbe EV-\nready by 2025,\u201d according to the Land Transport Authority (LTA). Around 700\nHDB residential car parks \u2014 one in every three \u2014 now have EV chargers.\n\nSome 6,200 chargers have been installed across the island \u2014 more than half of\nwhich are publicly available at locations including car parks, gas stations,\nand shopping malls. To widen access, authorities want every one of the more\nthan 2,000 car parks under the HDB to have EV chargers by next year.\n\nAn electric fast charger takes approximately an hour to fully charge a vehicle\n\u2014 these are currently available in locations like malls and petrol stations,\nand planned to be introduced to public housing estates by 2025. Land Transport\nAuthority\n\nNot all chargers installed across Singapore will be slow. While \u201covernight\nslow charging will continue to be the predominant charging strategy for most\nvehicles, high-powered fast chargers will be needed to meet the needs of\ncertain segments of high-mileage EVs such as taxis or commercial vehicle\nfleets\u201d that may need a midday top-up, the LTA said.\n\nThe fast chargers, rated at up to 120 kilowatts, take around an hour to fully\ncharge a vehicle. About 120 will be deployed in 60 public housing estates and\nindustrial zones across the country by 2025; the existing fast chargers are\nlargely located in malls and office complexes, according to the LTA.\n\nUnder an agreement signed last month with Chinese tech giant Huawei, the LTA\nwill also install some ultrafast chargers, which can charge EVs 10 times\nquicker than most existing fast chargers in Singapore. Rated at 480kW, these\nare touted as the fastest EV chargers in the region, and can fully charge a\nvehicle in 30 minutes. In comparison, regular chargers can take six to eight\nhours, and the 50kW fast chargers need about an hour.\n\nThe fully liquid-cooled ultrafast chargers are a \u201cpotential game changer,\u201d\nDerek Tan, chief executive of EVe, a unit of the LTA that is setting up the\npublic charging infrastructure, told Rest of World. Especially for drivers of\ntaxis, private hire vehicles, and light goods vehicles, \u201cwe can help [them]\nsave even more time,\u201d Tan said.\n\nBut even ultrafast chargers may not be enough to convert all drivers in\nSingapore. While the government has urged car owners to switch to EVs, that\ninitiative is butting up against long-standing policies to discourage people\nfrom having private vehicles at all.\n\n> \u201cThey are selling sustainability but it\u2019s actually more expensive to be\n> sustainable.\u201d\n\nSimply owning a car in Singapore requires a costly certificate of entitlement\nas part of a quota system to limit the number of vehicles on the road. A\n10-year certificate can cost as much as 100,000 Singapore dollars ($75,000)\nfor a regular sedan, depending on engine capacity. That\u2019s not counting the\ncost of the car itself, plus taxes and import duties, making Singapore the\nmost expensive country in the world to be a car owner.\n\nDespite savings on gas and generous EV rebates, the cost of maintaining an EV\nis higher than other cars, drivers in Singapore told Rest of World. They\npointed to higher road tax rates and insurance premiums, and said that EVs had\nlower resale value given the limited battery life.\n\n\u201cThey are selling sustainability but it\u2019s actually more expensive to be\nsustainable,\u201d Wong Jun Heng, 45, told Rest of World. \u201cI don\u2019t see people\nadopting fully electric vehicles to an extent that will justify this\ninfrastructure investment unless you fix the cost.\u201d\n\nThe cost of charging an EV is also likely to rise after changes to licensing\nand registration requirements for commercial charging service providers.\n\nHybrid and fully electric vehicles made up nearly two-thirds of all cars\nregistered in Singapore last year. EVs made up just under a fifth of the\ntotal. With new registrations for gas-powered vehicles set to be scrapped six\nyears from now, that number will rise, especially with the launch of more\naffordable EV models.\n\nAt the same time, Singapore aims to use mass public transport for 75% of peak-\ntime commutes by 2030. Half the country\u2019s bus fleet is also expected to be\nelectrified by then, according to the LTA. EV owners hoping for more\nincentives from the government are likely to be disappointed. \u201cWe are\ncommitted to building a comprehensive and accessible charging network for EV\ndrivers ... [but] we remain committed to promoting [walking, cycling, and\npublic transport] as the most sustainable travel mode,\u201d an LTA spokesperson\ntold Rest of World.\n\nFor Wong, who has a hybrid car, owning a vehicle is a necessity as he\nregularly ferries his aged parents and grandmother around. But he won\u2019t be\nswitching to an EV just yet. \u201cMoney-wise, it just doesn\u2019t make sense now,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nNicholas Yong is a journalist and writer based in Singapore.\n\nRead more stories\n\nRegional Champions\n\nTSMC\u2019s debacle in the American desert\n\nMissed deadlines and tension among Taiwanese and American coworkers are\nplaguing the chip giant\u2019s Phoenix expansion.\n\nBy Viola Zhou\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nThe TikTok ban is bigger than just ByteDance\n\nThe U.S. clampdown on Chinese-owned companies won't end here.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\nGlobal\n\n2023 Impact Report\n\nThe global reach and impact of our journalism in 2023\n\nBy Rest of World\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": false}
