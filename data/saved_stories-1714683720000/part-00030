But that\u2019s changed now, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, is under\nconstruction and when completed will provide around 7% of the UK\u2019s\nelectricity.\n\nHinkley Point C is set to be the most expensive nuclear power station ever\nbuilt. In fact, it is more than four times more expensive on a pound-for-\nmegawatt basis than the average nuclear power plant built in South Korea. And\neven Flamanville 3, a French plant that uses the same reactor (EPR-1750) and\nbuilt by the same company (EDF), is set to cost at least 25% less.\n\nWhy has Hinkley Point C been so expensive and how do we make new nuclear power\nin Britain cheaper? Britain Remade travelled to Somerset to visit Hinkley\nPoint C a few months back to try to find a satisfactory answer to those two\nquestions.\n\n(We also just really wanted to see Big Carl, the world\u2019s largest crane.)\n\nin awe at the size of this lad. absolute unit.\n\nHinkley Point C is, by some distance, Europe\u2019s largest construction project.\nWe arrived at the site through what I am reliably told is Europe\u2019s second\nlargest bus station. As we entered, we walked past a big rock with \u2018safety is\nour overriding priority\u2019 engraved on it. Nuclear, of course, is the safest\nform of power generation there is.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s probably too safe. Nuclear expert Jack Devanney argues safety\ncomes at a cost. There are some nuclear safety measures that cost between one\nmillion and several billion pounds per life saved. By pushing up the cost of\nbuilding and running nuclear power stations, the regulations mean that we end\nup using much more dangerous forms of energy generation like gas or coal,\nwhich are not only bad for the climate but also kill millions with air\npollution.\n\nStill, on a building site, safety is a sensible priority and some of the\nsafety measures employed at Hinkley Point C could (and should) be rolled out\nmuch more widely. Take the constant signs telling you not to look at your\nphone while walking \u2013 something for TfL to look into perhaps.\n\nHinkley Point C isn\u2019t the latest EPR-1750, it is \u201cthe first UK EPR\u201d\n\nPractice makes perfect. The more times you do something the cheaper it is to\ndo. Nuclear is no exception to this rule. For example, EDF told us that\nwelding on the second reactor at Hinkley Point C is being done four times\nfaster than on the first one. In fact, the second reactor is set to be around\n30% cheaper than the first.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t really surprise us that Hinkley Point C has been so expensive. It\nis, after all, the first nuclear power station Britain has built in almost\nthree decades. South Korea, who have kept costs low, have done so by building\nfleets. There\u2019s really no shortcut to an experienced skilled workforce. Some\nmistakes need to be made so we can learn from them.\n\nHinkley Point C is on paper the 4th EPR-1750 plant being built. In theory, we\nshould be able to learn lessons from EPR-1750 projects from around the world.\nIn reality, it\u2019s more complicated.\n\nThe UK and France (and for that matter, Finland) have different approaches to\nnuclear regulation. On the continent and across the pond, regulators tend to\nset out clear rules on the design of nuclear reactors. By contrast, the UK\ntakes an outcome-based approach to regulation. In essence, we don\u2019t care how\nyou make your reactor safe as long as it is safe. Our approach is more\nflexible, which is good for innovation and why SMR developers see the UK as a\ngreat destination, but it creates problems too.\n\nEDF were forced to prove that their reactor design, already approved\nelsewhere, could meet the UK\u2019s goals on safety. The UK\u2019s Office for Nuclear\nRegulation, it turns out, often takes a different view to its French\ncounterpart on whether a design is up to standard.\n\nIn total, meeting the requirements of the Office for Nuclear Regulation led to\na staggering 7,000 design modifications. The result is Hinkley Point C will\nuse 25% more concrete and 35% more steel than it would otherwise.\n\nHinkley Point C is so different from its counterparts in Flamanville and\nOlkiluoto that it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as just another EPR-1750, but rather\nthe first \u201cUK EPR.\u201d A brand new design.\n\nThe consequence of that is many of the lessons EDF have learnt the hard way on\nFlamanville 3 can\u2019t always be applied to Hinkley Point C. We get to make\nentirely new mistakes of our own.\n\nEDF have spent tens of millions of pounds trying to save around 112 fish\n\nNuclear power is the densest form of energy there is. In fact, you could bury\nall the nuclear fuel used in US power stations over the last 60 years in a 10m\nmetre-deep football field. To produce as much electricity with solar as\nHinkley Point C would use a plot of land almost fifty times bigger than Hyde\nPark.\n\nBy taking up a smaller footprint than any other form of energy to produce a\ngiven megawatt, nuclear power should be a conservationist\u2019s ideal source of\npower. This, by the way, was a key argument made by eco-modernists like Mark\nLynas, Stewart Brand and the people at The Breakthrough Institute.\n\nWhen you take into account that the energy we need to keep the lights on has\nto be produced somehow, a new nuclear power station will almost certainly have\na positive impact on nature and biodiversity (even putting aside the climate\nbenefits). Yet, our planning system doesn\u2019t take counterfactuals like this\ninto account.\n\nTo win planning approval, Hinkley Point C was forced to produce a mammoth\n31,401 page environmental impact assessment and Sizewell C\u2019s EIA was even\nlonger!\n\nA key issue that the 31,401 pages covered was the impact Hinkley Point C would\nhave on marine life. To generate power, pressurised water reactors like\nHinkley Point C use a fission reaction to heat water in order to generate\nsteam to power a turbine. To keep generating power that steam needs to be\ncooled and that\u2019s typically done by pumping seawater into a condenser. By the\nway, to bust a common myth, this seawater never actually enters the reactor.\n\nWhen you pump in the water, fish occasionally get caught and, er, cooked. EDF\nhas spent millions to avoid that as much as possible. Unlike in Flamanville,\nHinkley Point C\u2019s water intake has been re-designed to take in water at a\nlower velocity to give fish a better chance of swimming away. On top of that,\nthey also have a fish recovery and return system.\n\nYet that\u2019s not all, there\u2019s also provisions in their Development Consent Order\nto install an acoustic fish deterrent. In effect, to save around 45 tonnes of\nfish (less than a small fishing vessel takes in each year) EDF must install a\n288 speakers to produce a jumbo-jet level racket playing sounds that fish\ndon\u2019t like \u2013 a recording of Baby Shark perhaps?\n\nThis is not only an expensive way to save a tiny number of fish (only 112 of\nthe fish deterred are protected), but also potentially dangerous to human\nlife. The water around Hinkley Point C is murky and EDF contend that the only\nway to install it is to use trained divers. Diving in this water is not\nwithout risk and there\u2019s a real possibility that someone might drown in the\nprocess of installing (and subsequently maintaining) it.\n\nEDF are trying to persuade regulators to remove this burdensome requirement\nand proposing to create a biodiversity enhancing 840 acre saltmarsh nearby\ninstead. Yet, the process of getting out of the requirement has been extremely\nlong. It started in 2019 and they\u2019re not expecting a decision until 2025.\n\nEDF have spent hundreds of millions of pounds on protecting fish and will need\nto pay potentially hundreds of millions more if they can agree on the salt\nmarsh. If they can\u2019t agree, then there\u2019s a risk the powerplant will never be\nallowed to be switched on.\n\nAnd remember, the biggest threat to biodiversity is climate change. If we\ncan\u2019t switch on plants like Hinkley Point C then it means relying on climate\nchange causing fossil fuels for longer.\n\nHow bogus concerns about \u201cradioactive\u201d mud delayed construction for a year\n\nTo install those cooling water intakes means dredging a lot of mud. And that\nmud has to be dumped somewhere. EDF originally wanted to use a site near\nCardiff. Yet, bogus concerns around radiation, the mud was next to two other\nnuclear power plants, led to massive delays to work starting.\n\nWhat should have been a routine process was anything but. EDF gained a licence\nto dump the mud in Cardiff Grounds dumping site in 2013, but Welsh politicians\nand a petition led to a drawn-out dispute.\n\nIn some cases, politicians opposed to the dumping made claims that could\npolitely only be described as utter nonsense. Welsh Assembly Member, Neil\nMcEvoy, asserted without evidence that \u201cno dose of non-naturally occurring\nradiation is safe.\u201d\n\nFor context, the dose of radiation received by a member of the public from the\ndump would be just 0.002 mili-Sieverts. That\u2019s less than a 25th of the\nradioactive exposure that one gets from a single transatlantic flight and\nroughly equivalent to eating 40 extra bananas in a year. In other words, it\u2019s\nnext to nothing.\n\nIn fact, it is so un-radioactive that it cannot legally be described as\n\u2018radioactive\u2019.\n\nWhen they started work the plan was to dump it all in Cardiff Grounds, but\nwhen space opened up at a nearby dumping site in Portishead, they decided to\ndump the mud from the second phase of dredging there.\n\nAnti-nuclear campaigners, including the keyboardist from the Super Furry\nAnimals (a man known for Fuzzy Logic), used it as an opportunity to take EDF\nto court on the grounds they needed to do another Environmental Impact\nAssessment. Dealing with their legal challenge took six months - it was\neventually dismissed at the High Court in March 2022.\n\nBut the delay to the project went beyond those six months. Construction is\nreliant on weather windows. In some cases a few months delay can push a\nproject back by a year. That\u2019s what happened here. EDF reckon that pushing it\nback by a year made the overall project around \u00a3150m more expensive. All of\nthat expense over some mud that will expose a member of the public to less\nradiation than they\u2019d get from eating 20g of brazil nuts.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more!\n\nEDF were also forced to pipe naturally draining water far out to sea because\nthe water was high in Zinc. Not only was this expensive costing tens of\nmillions, but as the water was naturally draining it provided no environmental\nbenefit. Oh, and they had to pay rent to the very agencies that told them to\ndo this to run the pipe across their land.\n\nIt is now 11 years since Hinkley Point C\u2019s planning application was accepted.\nIn that time, a lot has been learnt about the best way to store spent fuel\n(otherwise known as nuclear waste). EDF initially planned to build a \u2018wet\nstore\u2019 because it\u2019s easier to inspect, but they\u2019ve now decided to switch to a\n\u2018dry store\u2019 because experience shows they\u2019re simpler to run. In terms of\nsafety, there\u2019s no difference and the Environment Agency has granted them the\nrelevant permit to make the change. However, switching systems will mean the\nbuilding the waste is actually stored in will need to be about 79m longer.\n\nThis, it turns out, meets the threshold to be considered a \u2018material change\u2019\nand as a result EDF will have to apply for special permission from the\nplanning inspectorate. As a result, it means more delay and more legal fees\nfor a relatively minor change when you look at it in the context of what is an\nabsolutely massive site that is almost certain to be approved.\n\nThis is part of a wider problem, by making it hard to make changes, Britain\nbuilds new infrastructure slower and less efficiently than it should. Most\nmajor infrastructure builders when asked could list examples of beneficial\nchanges they didn\u2019t make due to the cost of going through planning again,\naccording to research from the National Infrastructure Planning Association.\nEven modest and clearly beneficial changes like the Lower Thames Crossing\nusing one tunnel boring machine instead of two mean that lawyers and\nenvironmental experts are drafted in to prove the change is \u2018non-material\u2019.\n\nHow to make nuclear cheaper in Britain\n\nBuilding Britain\u2019s first nuclear power station in almost three decades was\nnever going to be easy, but boy have we made it harder than it needs to be.\n\nThe sheer number of changes required by our nuclear regulator not only meant\nusing more concrete and more steel, they also limited our ability to learn\nfrom Finland and France\u2019s experience. Delays caused by a drawn-out process of\npermitting and planning haven\u2019t helped either. But, even within a single\nproject, productivity is increasing as engineers learn from experience.\n\nSo, what needs to be done then to cut costs? I can think of a few things.\n\nReplication and learning are key to improving productivity, so reforming our\nnuclear regulator should be a priority. Where designs have been approved\nelsewhere by respected regulators in places like France or the US, we should\ndefer to their judgement and not insist on as many changes. Just as our\nMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency now grants automatic\napproval to drugs approved elsewhere by respected regulators, the Office for\nNuclear Regulation should automatically approve reactor designs certified as\nsafe elsewhere. It would mean that if South Korea\u2019s KEPCO wanted to build\ntheir tried-and-tested low cost reactor here then they wouldn\u2019t have to make\nthousands of changes and build an almost bespoke design just for us.\n\nBut wider changes to planning policy are needed. Environmental Impact\nAssessments and Habitats Regulations should be reformed too so developers\ndon\u2019t need to engage in extremely costly mitigation measures and produce tens\nof thousands of pages of documentation to build a new nuclear power station.\nIt also needs to be made much easier to make changes as a project develops.\n\nAnd there's a deeper question that needs to be asked about the way we regulate\nnuclear energy. Have we gone too far in the pursuit of safety? Do we pay more\nto save a hypothetical life in nuclear energy than we do in any other areas of\nlife, such as on the road or when we regulate other forms of energy?\n\nOn all of this there\u2019s some hope. The day we visited Hinkley Point C, the\nGovernment published its civil nuclear roadmap. It includes plans to allow\nSMRs to be built \u2018anywhere\u2019 that meets certain criteria (not just designated\nsites), a commitment to more international regulatory co-operation, and a new\nSmarter Regulation Challenge.\n\nCould it go further? By all means, but it's a good start.\n\n### Subscribe to Notes on Growth\n\nBy Sam Dumitriu \u00b7 Launched 3 years ago\n\nMarkets, tech and policy.\n\n9 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n9\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Visiting the world's most expensive nuclear station\n\nwww.samdumitriu.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nBritain's infrastructure is too expensive\n\nRailways, Trams, and Roads all cost more to build in Britain\n\nAug 25, 2023 \u2022\n\nSam Dumitriu\n\nand\n\nBen Hopkinson\n\n62\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Britain's infrastructure is too expensive\n\nwww.samdumitriu.com\n\n27\n\nI\u2019m a skills sceptic, and maybe you are too.\n\nBrits are less productive because it is too hard to build stuff.\n\nJun 5, 2023 \u2022\n\nSam Dumitriu\n\n41\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I\u2019m a skills sceptic, and maybe you are too.\n\nwww.samdumitriu.com\n\n5\n\nHow to get new nuclear built faster\n\nLet's allow any design approved in the US or Europe to be built in Britain\n\nJan 17 \u2022\n\nSam Dumitriu\n\n33\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to get new nuclear built faster\n\nwww.samdumitriu.com\n\n10\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sam Dumitriu\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
