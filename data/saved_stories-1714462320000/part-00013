He had created over 100\nwall drawings across 27,000 square feet of space, made of three stories of\nnarrow hallways and expansive rooms with drawings on all sides. The work is\ndriven by shapes and lines; there was mathematical rigor to every drawing,\ninspired by geometry and simple rules. They are accompanied by a short\ndescription:\n\n> Wall Drawing 1180: Within a four-meter circle, draw 10,000 black straight\n> lines and 10,000 black not straight lines. All lines are randomly spaced and\n> equally distributed.\n\nBut \u201caccompanied\u201d is not the right word for it.\n\nIt\u2019s common for artists to use geometry. It was the rigor that was so\nimpressive. The descriptions of the artwork were no longer than a few\nparagraphs, and usually only one or two sentences. All precise and meticulous.\n\n> Wall Drawing 46: Vertical lines, not straight, not touching, covering the\n> wall evenly.\n\nHe started his first drawings with a series of parallel, straight lines. The\nwork grew to include minimalist geometric shapes driven by straight lines,\ndrawn with pencil or pen with exacting geometry. As his career progressed, he\nincorporated more color and complex patterns into his art; more bold lines,\nvibrant colors, irregular shapes, different materials. All driven by initial\ninstructions which he followed meticulously.\n\n> Wall Drawing 38: Tissue paper cut into 4-cm squares and inserted into holes\n> in the gray pegboard walls. All holes in the walls are filled randomly.\n\nCloser to the end of his life, his work became increasingly collaborative. He\nviewed the rules as art in its own right; he would work with other artists and\nthey would execute the complex instructions, while bringing their own unique\nperspective and style to the drawings. Each floor of Mass MoCa was a phase in\nhis career, and the final floor included his collaborations with other\nartists. You could see the subtle departure from the rest of the work; more\nvibrant colors, a new material, but keeping the exacting rigor that LeWitt\nmaintained.\n\nThere is a story in the evolution of his work. He started individualistic,\nsimple, regimented. His last works were collaborative, with diverse mediums\nand an expansive visual vocabulary.\n\nThe instructions themselves are elegant and beautiful. The work clearly starts\nthere. But it\u2019s not only that. They are only abstract words; the execution\nbrought them to life. The work didn\u2019t exist without the painstaking execution.\n\nLet\u2019s say you are drawing 10,000 straight black lines, and each line takes\nabout 10 seconds each. That would mean almost 28 hours of meticulous focus.\nAnd that would be very fast, since each line must be evenly spaced and equally\ndistributed.\n\nThere is a lesson of \u201ccraft\u201d in this space. The vision, the execution, and the\nconstant exchange between the two. It is somewhere between science and art.\nThe analytical see the geometry; the artistic see the symmetry. It is not\ndefinitively one or the other. Somewhere between them is the craft.\n\nThe most incredible man-made achievements can be described in this way. Take\nan Eames lounge chair as an example: curved plywood, thick leather cushions,\nthree distinct pieces. A moleskin notebook: oil-cloth bound cover, elastic\nclosure, compact. A Montblanc pen: handcrafted ribs, iconic emblem, sleek\nbody. They can be described with simple words, but it\u2019s not only the words\nthat make them beautiful. They are beautiful because their craftsmanship\nstarts with their description and continues with their execution.\n\nEveryone starts where LeWitt did. Your early vocabulary starts narrow and\nelementary, separate from others. As you have more interactions with the work,\nit changes your vocabulary and your vocabulary changes the work. You start\nseeing what makes something have deep quality and the beauty in collaborating\non that vision.\n\nThere\u2019s a widely known trap in the world for people without experience. They\nwill say things like, \u201cthat [incredible] product would have existed no matter\nwhat, they were just the first to think of it.\u201d This is not true. There is a\nfeedback mechanism between what exists in the current moment and the way\npeople view the world. You would not think to start an online store before the\nInternet. The reality is that the idea was only the beginning of a journey\nthat created the product.\n\nThe people who have experience will sometimes say the opposite, and they are\nalso wrong. The idea matters. It\u2019s not only about execution. The two shouldn\u2019t\nbe separated; the idea should evolve over time with the work. The idea drives\nthe early work, and the early work changes the idea, and so on. It is the\ninterchange between the two that makes craft. It\u2019s taking feedback from the\nwork and allowing it to change the idea. The vocabulary evolves with the work.\nIf you trivialize the idea, the work will suffer. And vice versa.\n\nAnother way people commonly say this is that it\u2019s about the journey, not the\ndestination. This is not entirely true. The destination is the inspiration;\nit\u2019s why you started in the first place. It\u2019s why you keep going. Your\nexperience along the way will change your expectations, things will happen\nthat are beyond your control, and your destination will change. The\ndestination still matters.\n\nThe hardest part is allowing the idea to change with the work, while making\nsure the idea keeps its importance.\n\nIf you have thoughts you would like to share, feel free to email me at\nme@0xcadams.com.\n\n### Related\n\nThere are no essays which link to this.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
