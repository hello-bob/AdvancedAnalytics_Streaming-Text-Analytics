When combined with software-programmable devices such\n> as CPUs, it is possible to obtain higher performance by spatially\n> distributing the parallelizable sections of an application throughout the\n> reconfigurable device while the CPU is in charge of control-intensive\n> sections. This work introduces an elastic Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable\n> Architecture (CGRA) integrated into an energy-efficient RISC-V-based SoC\n> designed for the embedded domain. The microarchitecture of CGRA supports\n> conditionals and irregular loops, making it adaptable to domain-specific\n> applications. Additionally, we propose specific mapping strategies that\n> enable the efficient utilization of the CGRA for both simple applications,\n> where the fabric is only reconfigured once (one-shot kernel), and more\n> complex ones, where it is necessary to reconfigure the CGRA multiple times\n> to complete them (multi-shot kernels). Large kernels also benefit from the\n> independent memory nodes incorporated to streamline data accesses. Due to\n> the integration of CGRA as an accelerator of the RISC-V processor enables a\n> versatile and efficient framework, providing adaptability, processing\n> capacity, and overall performance across various applications. The design\n> has been implemented in TSMC 65 nm, achieving a maximum frequency of 250\n> MHz. It achieves a peak performance of 1.22 GOPs computing one-shot kernels\n> and 1.17 GOPs computing multi-shot kernels. The best energy efficiency is\n> 72.68 MOPs/mW for one-shot kernels and 115.96 MOPs/mW for multi-shot\n> kernels. The design integrates power and clock-gating techniques to tailor\n> the architecture to the embedded domain while maintaining performance. The\n> best speed-ups are 17.63x and 18.61x for one-shot and multi-shot kernels.\n> The best energy savings in the SoC are 9.05x and 11.10x for one-shot and\n> multi-shot kernels.\n\nComments:| 14 pages, 11 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Hardware Architecture (cs.AR)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.12503 [cs.AR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.12503v1 [cs.AR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.12503arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Daniel V\u00e1zquez [view email] [v1] Thu, 18 Apr 2024 20:48:46 UTC (5,219\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled STRELA: STReaming ELAstic CGRA Accelerator for\nEmbedded Systems, by Daniel Vazquez (1) and 8 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
