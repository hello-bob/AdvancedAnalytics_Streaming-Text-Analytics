This threw\nNvidia's plans into disarray.\n\n\"The architecture we chose was clever at the time, but it turned out to have\nbeen the wrong architecture completely,\" continues Huang. \"This is 1995,\nMicrosoft had come out with Windows 95, and the API called DirectX is the\narchitecture that everybody else uses except us. We had never even implemented\na graphics architecture like DirectX before. And the rest of the industry, now\nsome 50 companies, are all over us. And so the question is, what do we do?\"\n\n> The SEGA CEO that Jensen Huang is referring to was Shoichiro Irimajiri. The\n> amount that SEGA gave Huang was $5 million, saving Nvidia from bankruptcy.\n> Source: https://t.co/zzMkJjUmIf pic.twitter.com/Rju0y5Dzq0\u2014 John Andersen\n> (@JohnAndersen21) April 30, 2024\n\nNvidia's contract with Sega put the company in a tight spot. \"If we had\nfinished that game console with Sega and fulfilled our contract, we would have\nspent two years working on the wrong architecture while everybody else is\nracing ahead in this new world that, quite frankly, we kind of started,\" says\nHuang.\n\n\"On the other hand, if we didn\u2019t finish the contract, then we run out of\nmoney. And so I was confronted with a situation where we would finish the\nproject and die, or not finish the project and die right away.\"\n\nThis is where the kindness of Sega's then-CEO Shoichiro Irimajiri comes into\nplay, as Huang tells Sequoia:\n\n> I went to Sega and to the credit of their CEO, Irimajiri-san, I told him our\n> circumstance is that if we finish this game console for you, our company\n> would be out of business. And, quite frankly, I think that this architecture\n> that we would build for you would be the wrong architecture because the\n> world is moving towards this other approach called inverse rendering,\n> inverse texture mapping.\n>\n> He asked me what I\u2019m asking him to do. And so I told him that, although\n> there\u2019s no reason for him to do this, I would like him to let us off of our\n> contract, relieve us of our responsibility of fulfilling the contract, but\n> pay us in full. And, they got absolutely nothing out of it. There was no\n> reason for him to do it. And, he thought about it for a couple days. He, you\n> know, came back to me and, and said, I\u2019d like to help you.\n>\n> You can\u2019t discount the kindness of people when you\u2019re starting your company,\n> when you benefit from the kindness of all the people that support you. But\n> in this particular case, it was some 5 million dollars, I think it was, that\n> they continued to pay us. It was all the money that we had. And it gave us\n> just enough money to hunker down.\n\nNvidia's next project, the Riva 128, was a commercial hit. It then released\nthe GeForce 256, the world's first GPU. Microsoft then selected GeForce to\npower its Xbox console, and the rest is history.\n\nWithout Sega's act of kindness, it's unlikely Nvidia would be here today \u2013 and\nthat would have sent shockwaves rippling through the history of the video game\nindustry; for example, the best-selling Nintendo Switch uses an Nvidia chip.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### News Grand Theft Auto III Likely Wouldn't Exist Without The Sega Dreamcast\n\nHere's how Sega's console helped Rockstar find its groove\n\n### News Want Crisp HDMI Output From Your Sega Genesis?
