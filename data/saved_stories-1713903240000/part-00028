Credit:\nimaginima/Getty\n\nIt is the world\u2019s thinnest gold leaf: a gossamer sheet of gold just one atom\nthick. Researchers have synthesized^1 the long-sought material, known as\ngoldene, which is expected to capture light in ways that could be useful in\napplications such as sensing and catalysis.\n\nGoldene is a gilded cousin of graphene, the iconic atom-thin material made of\ncarbon that was discovered in 2004. Since then, scientists have identified\nhundreds more of these 2D materials. But it has been particularly difficult to\nproduce 2D sheets of metals, because their atoms have always tended to cluster\ntogether to make nanoparticles instead.\n\nResearchers have previously reported single-atom-thick layers of tin^2 and\nlead^3 stuck to various substances, and they have produced gold sheets\nsandwiched between other materials. But \u201cwe submit that goldene is the first\nfree-standing 2D metal, to the best of our knowledge\u201d, says materials\nscientist Lars Hultman at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden, who is part of the\nteam behind the new research. Crucially, the simple chemical method used to\nmake goldene should be amenable to larger-scale production, the researchers\nreported in Nature Synthesis on 16 April^1.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited about it,\u201d says Stephanie Reich, a solid-state physicist and\nmaterials scientist at the Free University of Berlin, who was not involved in\nthe work. \u201cPeople have been thinking for quite some time how to take\ntraditional metals and make them into really well-ordered 2D monolayers.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, researchers at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) said that they\nhad produced goldene, but the Link\u00f6ping team contends that the prior material\nprobably contained multiple atomic layers, on the basis of the electron\nmicroscopy images and other data that were published in ACS Applied Materials\nand Interfaces^4. Reich agrees that the 2022 study failed to prove that the\nmaterial was singler-layer goldene. The principal authors of the NYUAD study\ndid not respond to Nature\u2019s questions about their work.\n\n## Golden age\n\nTo prepare goldene, the Link\u00f6ping researchers started with a material\ncontaining atomic monolayers of silicon sandwiched between titanium carbide.\nWhen they added gold on top of this sandwich, it diffused into the structure\nand exchanged places with the silicon to create a trapped atom-thick layer of\ngold (see \u2018Gold mining\u2019). They then etched away the titanium carbide to\nrelease free-standing goldene sheets that were up to 100 nanometres wide, and\nroughly 400 times as thin as the thinnest commercial gold leaf, Hultman\nestimates.\n\nThat etching process used a solution of alkaline potassium ferricyanide known\nas Murukami\u2019s reagent. \u201cWhat\u2019s so fascinating is that it\u2019s a 100-year-old\nrecipe used by Japanese smiths to decorate ironwork,\u201d Hultman says. The\nresearchers also added surfactant molecules \u2014 compounds that formed a\nprotective barrier between goldene and the surrounding liquid \u2014 to stop the\nsheets from sticking together.\n\nThe Link\u00f6ping team suggests that goldene might be useful in applications in\nwhich gold nanoparticles already show promise. Light can generate waves in the\nsea of electrons at a gold nanoparticle\u2019s surface, which can channel and\nconcentrate that energy. This strong response to light has been harnessed in\ngold photocatalysts to split water to produce hydrogen, for instance. Goldene\ncould open up opportunities in areas such as this, Hultman says, but its\nproperties need to be investigated in more detail first.\n\n\u201cI think the research is really interesting,\u201d says Graham Hutchings, a chemist\nat the University of Cardiff, UK, who develops gold catalysts. But he worries\nthat any residual traces of iron from Murukami\u2019s reagent might hamper the\ndevelopment of goldene as a catalyst. \u201cI would think that potential\ncontamination with iron is going to cause a few problems in applications,\u201d he\nsays.\n\nFor now, the Link\u00f6ping researchers are seeking better ways to sieve goldene\nfrom the solution used to make it, and to grow larger flakes of the material.\nThey are also exploring whether their method can be used to make monolayers of\nother catalytic metals, including iridium, platinum and palladium.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01118-0\n\n## References\n\n  1.
