Becoming a\nparent showed me how tempting, and how dangerous, that exchange can be.\n\nBy Jia Tolentino\n\nMay 4, 2024\n\nIllustration by Ard Su\n\nShortly after I became pregnant with my second child, in the fall of 2022, I\ndecided to try a modest experiment. I wanted to see whether I could hide my\npregnancy from my phone. After spending my twenties eagerly surveilling and\nsharing the details of my life online, I had already begun trying to erect\nsome walls of technological privacy: I\u2019d deleted most apps on my phone and\nturned off camera, location, and microphone access for nearly all of the ones\nthat I did have; I had disabled Siri\u2014I just found it annoying\u2014and I didn\u2019t\nhave any smart devices. For the experiment, I would abide by some additional\nrestrictions. I wouldn\u2019t Google anything about pregnancy nor shop for baby\nstuff either online or using a credit card, and neither would my husband,\nbecause our I.P. addresses\u2014and thus the vast, matrixed fatbergs of personal\ndata assembled by unseen corporations to pinpoint our consumer and political\nidentities\u2014were linked. I wouldn\u2019t look at pregnancy accounts on Instagram or\npregnancy forums on Reddit. I wouldn\u2019t update my period tracker or use a\npregnancy app.\n\nNearly every time we load new content on an app or a Web site, ad-exchange\ncompanies\u2014Google being the largest among them\u2014broadcast data about our\ninterests, finances, and vulnerabilities to determine exactly what we\u2019ll see;\nmore than a billion of these transactions take place in the U.S. every hour.\nEach of us, the data-privacy expert Wolfie Christl told me, has \u201cdozens or\neven hundreds\u201d of digital identifiers attached to our person; there\u2019s an\nestimated eighteen-billion-dollar industry for location data alone. In August,\n2022, Mozilla reviewed twenty pregnancy and period-tracking apps and found\nthat fifteen of them made a \u201cbuffet\u201d of personal data available to third\nparties, including addresses, I.P. numbers, sexual histories, and medical\ndetails. In most cases, the apps used vague language about when and how this\ndata could be shared with law enforcement. (A 2020 FOIA lawsuit filed by the\nA.C.L.U. revealed that the Department of Homeland Security had purchased\naccess to location data for millions of people in order to track them without\na warrant. ICE and C.B.P. subsequently said they would stop using such data.)\nThe scholar Shoshana Zuboff has called this surveillance capitalism, \u201ca new\neconomic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden\ncommercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales.\u201d Through our\nphones, we are under perpetual surveillance by companies that buy and sell\ndata about what kind of person we are, whom we might vote for, what we might\npurchase, and what we might be nudged into doing.\n\nA decade ago, the sociology professor Janet Vertesi conducted a more rigorous\nform of the hidden-pregnancy experiment. Using an elaborate system of code\nwords and the anonymous browser Tor, she managed to digitally hide her\npregnancy all the way up to the birth of her child. In an article about the\nexperience, for Time, she pointed to a Financial Times report, which found\nthat identifying a single pregnant woman is as valuable to data brokers as\nknowing the age, gender, and location of more than two hundred non-pregnant\npeople, because of how much stuff new parents tend to buy. She also noted that\nsimply attempting to evade market detection\u2014by, for example, purchasing stacks\nof gift cards in order to buy a stroller\u2014made her and her husband look as\nthough they were trying to commit fraud.\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to do anything so strict or elaborate. I\u2019d allow myself to text\nand send e-mails about my pregnancy, and to talk about it with my phone\nnearby. I assumed that, eventually, it would notice; I\u2019d just wait and see\nwhen a diaper ad popped up on Instagram. I liked the idea of establishing a\nbuffer zone between my psyche and the object that most closely monitors it. I\nfound it almost shocking to remember that this was possible.\n\nPregnancy tends to erode both your freedom and your privacy. Past a certain\npoint in your second trimester, strangers will begin reaching toward your\nstomach and telling you about the real difference between boys and girls. But\nI had eluded this during my first pregnancy, because COVID hit before I\nstarted showing. In the months that followed, I began to feel the difference\nbetween witnessing something and surveilling it, and to recognize that the\nmost pleasurable moments in my life had occurred out of the reach of any\noversight. I had felt then an almost psychedelic sense of autonomy; time was\ndilating, and the slow bloom inside me was beyond anyone\u2019s reach. I wanted to\nsee if I could feel anything like that again.\n\nDuring pregnancy, and in the early days of parenthood, one is both the object\nand the conductor of intense surveillance. Last year, the artist and filmmaker\nSophie Hamacher co-edited an anthology of writing on the subject, called\n\u201cSupervision,\u201d which was published by M.I.T. Press. \u201cAs I became absorbed with\ntracking and monitoring my child,\u201d Hamacher writes in the preface, \u201cI was\nincreasingly aware that I was a subject of tracking and monitoring by others:\nadvertisers, medical professionals, government entities, people on the street.\nI began to wonder about the relationship between the way I watched her and the\nways we were being watched.\u201d Surveillance encompasses both policing and\ncaretaking, Hamacher notes. In practice, its polarized qualities\u2014\u201cbeneficial\nand harmful, intimate and distanced\u201d\u2014intertwine. Baby monitors use technology\ndeveloped for the military. Many contemporary models run on CCTV.\n\nMost American households with young children use baby monitors or trackers;\ntwo recent surveys put market penetration at seventy-five and eighty-three per\ncent, respectively. (Both surveys were conducted by companies that make these\ndevices.) And there are now countless other ways that technology will help you\nto observe and scrutinize your child: nanny-cam Teddy bears, G.P.S. stroller\naccessories, scales that track your baby\u2019s weight over time, disks that can be\naffixed to diapers and which will notify you if your baby rolls onto his\nstomach while he\u2019s asleep. Increasingly, such products use A.I. to detect\nsigns of distress. \u201cThe need to know whether a child is safe and well is\nperfectly natural, which makes the nature of such surveillance appear\ninnocent,\u201d the writer and scholar Hannah Zeavin notes in \u201cFamily Scanning,\u201d\none of the essays in \u201cSupervision.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cthese technologies conceal\nthe possibility of false positives, disrupted emergency services, and of\ncollaboration with state forces\u2014wittingly or unwittingly\u2014all in the name of\nkeeping children safe.\u201d As a general rule, these devices don\u2019t lead to better\noutcomes for the babies they monitor. More often\u2014like social media, which\npromises connection as a salve for the loneliness created by social\nmedia\u2014parenting tech exacerbates, even calls into existence, the parental\nanxieties that it pledges to soothe.\n\nThis has become a common pattern in contemporary life. Nearly a fifth of U.S.\nhouseholds are estimated to use doorbell cameras, many of them from Ring, the\nAmazon-owned company that has expanded its reach through police partnerships\nand a dedicated app that encourages users to post footage of strangers. Ring\ncameras haven\u2019t made neighborhoods measurably safer, but they have made users\nmeasurably more paranoid, and placed more people, sometimes with grave\noutcomes, in contact with the police. Until recently, police could readily\naccess surveillance footage from the Ring network without a warrant by posting\nrequests on the app. It also gave its own employees and third-party\ncontractors \u201c \u2018free range\u2019 access\u201d to view and download videos from users\u2019\nhomes.\n\nIn 2015, the company Owlet started selling a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar\nSmart Sock, which monitored babies\u2019 heart rates and oxygen levels, and alerted\nparents if these figures were abnormal. Although the company insists that it\nhas made clear that the product is not intended to \u201ctreat or diagnose\u201d sudden\ninfant death syndrome\u2014and there is no evidence that it reduces the risk of\nSIDS occurring\u2014such devices are sometimes referred to as \u201cSIDS monitors.\u201d But,\nin 2017, an opinion piece in the Journal of the American Medical Association\ncautioned physicians against recommending the product. \u201cThere are no medical\nindications for monitoring healthy infants at home,\u201d the authors wrote. The\ndevice, they noted, could \u201cstimulate unnecessary fear, uncertainty, and self-\ndoubt in parents about their abilities to keep their infants safe.\u201d The\nfollowing year, a study in the same journal found \u201cconcerning\u201d inaccuracies in\noxygen readings. When Owlet went public, in February, 2021, the company had a\nvaluation of more than a billion dollars; later that year, the F.D.A. issued a\nwarning letter that the Smart Sock wasn\u2019t an authorized medical device, and\nthe company pulled it off the market. A million units had already been sold.\nThe following year, Owlet launched a new version, called the Dream Sock, which\nwould receive F.D.A. approval. Most of the reviews for the Dream Sock exude\nprofound gratitude. Parents write about the peace of mind that comes from\nknowing the baby is being constantly monitored, about not knowing what they\nwould do if the device didn\u2019t exist.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nTikTok and War Intersect in \u201cFollowing Valeria\u201d\n\nSurveillance capitalism, Zuboff writes, \u201caims to impose a new collective order\nbased on total certainty.\u201d But little is certain when it comes to babies. The\ncontrol that we feel when we\u2019re engaged in surveillance almost always proves\nillusory, though the control, or at least the influence, that others exert on\nus through surveillance is real.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that Roe v. Wade, a ruling grounded in the right to\nprivacy, was overturned at a time when privacy in the U.S was on its\nconceptual deathbed. There are other legal principles that might have served\nas a stronger foundation for abortion rights: the right to equal protection,\nor the right to bodily integrity. As Christyne Neff wrote, in 1991, the\nphysical effects of an ordinary pregnancy and delivery resemble those of a\nsevere beating\u2014flesh lacerated, organs rearranged, half a quart of blood lost.\nCan the state, she asked, rightfully compel a person to undergo this?\n\nSince Roe fell, two years ago, fourteen states have claimed that power in\nabsolute terms, banning abortion almost completely. Two states have\nsuccessfully passed abortion-vigilante laws, which confer the power of\ncarceral supervision on the public. Indiana\u2019s attorney general has argued that\nabortion records should be publicly available, like death records; Kansas\nrecently passed a law that would require abortion providers to collect details\nabout the personal lives of their patients and make that information available\nto the government. Birth control and sex itself may be up next for criminal\nsurveillance: the Heritage Foundation, last year, insisted, on Twitter, that\n\u201cconservatives have to lead the way in restoring sex to its true purpose, &\nending recreational sex & senseless use of birth control pills.\u201d\n\nFor many women in America, pregnancy was a conduit to state surveillance long\nbefore the end of Roe. Poor women, especially poor nonwhite women, are often\ndrug-tested during pregnancy, and sometimes during labor and delivery, without\ntheir informed consent. Women who take drugs during pregnancy have been\ncharged with child abuse or neglect, including in cases in which the drugs\nwere legal; women who have miscarried after taking drugs have been charged\nwith manslaughter, even homicide, even when no causal link was proved.\nSometimes this happens because the woman in question had responded to\nbillboards and service announcements promising to help pregnant people who are\nstruggling with substance use. In multiple states, women have been taken into\ncustody when the safety of the fetus was called into question. \u201cTo be pregnant\nand poor in the United States is to play a game of roulette with one\u2019s\nprivacy, presumed confidential relationship with medical providers, and basic\nconstitutional and medical rights,\u201d the law professor Michele Goodwin writes\nin \u201cPolicing the Womb,\u201d from 2020.\n\nGoodwin describes the case of a woman in Iowa named Christine Taylor, who, in\n2010, as a twenty-two-year-old mother of two, was accused of attempted\nfeticide after she fell down the stairs while pregnant. Part of the evidence\ncited by the police was that she reportedly told a nurse that she hadn\u2019t\nwanted the baby. (Ultimately, prosecutors decided not to press charges.) The\ncarceral surveillance of pregnancy entails the criminalization of ambivalence,\nthe inspection of these innermost desires. But the deepest truths about\nmotherhood seem to me to be rooted in conflicting, coexisting emotions:\nnightmare and rapture in the same moment during labor, the love and despair\nthat box each other at night in the weeks that follow, the joy of cuddling my\nnine-month-old undergirded by the horror of knowing that other babies are\nstarving and dying in rubble. Before I had my first child, I had badly wanted\nto get pregnant. I had planned for it, prepared for it, hoped for it. Still,\nwhen I saw the positive test result, I cried.\n\nMy modest experiment went surprisingly smoothly. Because I\u2019d had my first\nchild not long before, this time I didn\u2019t need to buy anything, and I didn\u2019t\nwant to learn anything. I smooth-brained my way to three months, four months,\nfive; no diaper ads. I called up a lawyer and data-privacy specialist named\nDominique Shelton Leipzig to get her perspective. Globally, she told me, we\ngenerate 2.5 quintillion bytes\u2014that\u2019s eighteen zeroes\u2014of data per day. \u201cThe\nshort answer is, you probably haven\u2019t hidden what you think you have,\u201d she\nsaid. I told her about the rules I\u2019d set for myself, that I didn\u2019t have many\napps and had bought nothing but prenatal vitamins, and that Instagram did not\nappear to have identified me as pregnant. She paused. \u201cI\u2019m amazed,\u201d she told\nme. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t see any ads, I think you might have succeeded.\u201d I\ncongratulated myself by instantly dropping the experiment and buying maternity\npants; ads for baby carriers popped up on my Instagram within minutes.\n\nI had felt little satisfaction hiding from the ad trackers\u2014if anything, I\u2019d\nonly become more conscious of how much surveillance I was engaged in, as both\nsubject and object, and how much more insidious the problem was becoming. We\nrarely have a clear understanding of what we\u2019re doing when we engage in\nsurveillance of ourselves or others. Life360, an app that\u2019s used by more than\nsixty million people and is marketed as an easy way to track your child\u2019s\nlocation via their smartphone, was found in 2021 to be selling raw location\ninformation to data brokers. (The company said it now sells only aggregate\ndata.) In a Pew survey from 2023, seventy-seven per cent of Americans said\nthey had very little to no trust in how social-media executives handle user\ndata, and seventy-one per cent were concerned about how the government uses\nit. In another survey, ninety-three per cent of Americans said they wouldn\u2019t\nbuy a doorbell camera if it sold data about their family. People just want to\nbe safer. I had wanted security, too, and affirmation\u2014and I had wanted to be a\nwriter. I had disclosed so much of my life to people I\u2019ll never know.\n\nMy husband and I had not bought a baby monitor for our first child, a choice\nthat satisfied his desire to not buy things and my desire to insist that\ncertain aspects of experience are fundamentally ungovernable. But shortly\nafter the second child was born she developed eczema, and started scratching\nher sweet, enormous cheeks in her sleep. One morning, my husband went to her\nand found that she\u2019d clawed her face open, leaving blood smudged all over her\nsleep sack and smeared all over her face. \u201cWe need a video monitor!\u201d I wailed,\nalready Googling options. \u201cWe need to buy a video monitor today.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t buy one, but for weeks I regretted it and second-guessed myself. And\nI surveilled the baby with technology in other ways all the time. In the early\nweeks, I relied on an app to tell me how much milk she\u2019d drunk and how many\nsoiled diapers she\u2019d had that day\u2014activities that I myself had witnessed just\nhours before. I felt like a Biblical angel with a thousand eyes, somehow\nunable to see anything. I took pictures because I knew I would have no memory\nof the precise contours of this exact baby in a month. When she didn\u2019t seem\nhungry enough, I panicked, obsessing over every feed.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the line between pathological self-surveillance and care for a\nnewborn? Is there one?\u201d Sarah Blackwood, an English professor at Pace\nUniversity, asks, in \u201cSupervision.\u201d Blackwood contrasts the \u201cfantasy of\nefficiency and sterility\u201d built into parenting tech with the \u201cpsychic state of\nwatchfulness so many mothers find themselves in\u201d\u2014a state that is \u201cmetastatic,\nfecund, beyond.\u201d One afternoon, my husband took the baby from me: she was\nsobbing, and I was incoherently frantic, trying to get her to eat. She was\nO.K., he told me; she\u2019d eat when she needed to. But I know what\u2019s good for\nher, and it\u2019s my job to make her do it, I thought, furious. Around the fringes\nof my consciousness, I felt a flicker of understanding about how this idea\nthat everything was controllable had become so ubiquitous, how we had confused\ncoercion with care. \u2666\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * The day the dinosaurs died.\n\n  * What if you started itching\u2014and couldn\u2019t stop?\n\n  * How a notorious gangster was exposed by his own sister.\n\n  * Woodstock was overrated.\n\n  * Diana Nyad\u2019s hundred-and-eleven-mile swim.\n\n  * Photo Booth: Deana Lawson\u2019s hyper-staged portraits of Black love.\n\n  * Fiction by Roald Dahl: \u201cThe Landlady\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nJia Tolentino is a staff writer at The New Yorker.
