I\njoined RuPaul, Kesha, and two different astrophysicists on the stage in\nVancouver. I was given 15 minutes, and took 17, to riffle through 47 slides\narticulating what I believe is the greatest challenge facing the U.S. It\u2019s not\ninequality, climate change, or war in the Middle East, but an issue that\nthreads these threats together: America\u2019s war on the young. A war of mutually\nassured destruction.\n\nA decent proxy for the success of a society is how it treats children. Not how\nindividuals parent, but the success of the structures, incentives, and\nleadership charged with preventing a tragedy of the commons. In sum, can we\nanswer a simple question: Do we love our children? In 2024 America, the\nrejoinder is disheartening.\n\n#### Breach of Contract\n\nWe\u2019ve broken the social contract that binds America: Work hard, play by the\nrules, and you\u2019ll be better off than your parents were. For the first time in\nour nation\u2019s history, this is no longer true. Today\u2019s 25-year-olds make less\nthan their parents and grandparents did at the same age, yet they carry\nstudent debt loads unimaginable to earlier generations. Neither the minimum\nnor median wage has kept pace with inflation or productivity gains, while\nhousing costs have outpaced them. The statistics on children\u2019s and young\nadults\u2019 well-being are staggering.\n\nNone of this is lost on young people, and the shattering of the social\ncontract has left them feeling rage and shame. Half of Americans older than 55\nsay they are \u201cextremely proud\u201d to be American; that number drops to 18% among\n18- to 34-year-olds. This weakens the immunity system of America, allowing\nminor cuts to U.S. society to bring on deadly opportunistic infections. Just\nas when someone in your life blows up at you, it is about the issue at hand\n... and it isn\u2019t. American youth\u2019s warranted concern on social justice issues,\ndespite remarkable progress on all these issues, turns seamlessly into rage.\n\n#### Hoarders\n\nWe don\u2019t lack the resources to level up young people and present the\nopportunities afforded my generation. But the cohorts who benefited most from\nthe extraordinary post-war economic boom of the 20th century have pulled the\nladder up behind them. In 1989 adults under 40 held 12% of household wealth,\nwhile those over 70 held 19%. Today those under 40 command just 7% of\nhousehold wealth, while those over 70 control 30%.\n\nHigher education is the most effective means of closing the generation gap.\nBut the incumbents have artificially constrained access, sequestering\nopportunity largely to wealthy households, peppered with a few freakishly\nremarkable kids from the lower 90% to smear vaseline over the caste(ing) of\nhigher ed. Elite schools tout their financial aid, emphasizing that students\nwith median household incomes pay little or no tuition, but it\u2019s a headfake.\nBeing more generous with a select few low-income students only wallpapers over\nexclusivity, when the goal should be to eliminate it. We have simply\nreshuffled the elites.\n\nHarvard\u2019s undergraduate class size has been static at 1,600 for half a\ncentury, while its endowment has grown nearly 500%. When your top-line revenue\nis up sixfold but you purposefully do not increase production, you are no\nlonger a public servant but a Chanel bag. Single-digit admissions rates are\nthe ultimate vanity metric, something deans and donors brag about at cocktail\nparties, when they should be a mark of shame. As I\u2019ve proposed before, we\nshould offer higher ed a grand bargain: Redirect the money earmarked for\nbailing out the one-third of America that has attended college to increasing\nfreshman seats and reducing costs. The Biden administration\u2019s proposed student\nloan bailouts shrink the tumor, but don\u2019t address the underlying cancer \u2014\ndeclining affordability and accessibility.\n\n#### Capital vs. Sweat\n\nWe have elevated capital over sweat (i.e., labor). The public is numb to this\nmythology, benefitting the incumbents who\u2019ve created it. Back in 2008, when\nthe market crashed, young(ish) people like me, coming into our prime income-\nearning years, were able to buy growth stocks at low valuations. The\nfoundation of my economic security was buying Amazon at $7 ($179 today) and\nApple at $7 ($167 today) and Netflix at $12 ($611 today). Ever since, however,\nwe\u2019ve inflated asset prices by pumping them full of steroids and stimulus\nusing low corporate tax rates and bailouts that are financed on the backs of\nyoung people. \u201cKeep me rich, on your credit card,\u201d said every American over\nthe age of 50 to citizens younger than them. In sum: Real median income from\nlabor is up 40% since 1974, while the S&P 500 is up 4,000%.\n\nWe\u2019ve protected the wealth created by ownership at the expense of income\nearned by labor through the tax code, which favors gains from investments.\nGains from stock sales are taxes at lower capital gains rates. Real estate\nholdings can appreciate tax free, and once sold, the gains can be rolled into\nanother investment. Again, a series of transfers of wealth from earners\n(youth) to owners (seniors).\n\n#### Representative?\n\nAnd what taxes are collected are increasingly redistributed to the generation\nwho needs them least. In 1985 the federal government spent three times more\nper capita on seniors than it did on kids. By 2019 that ratio had risen to\neight times. We\u2019ve cut senior poverty from 17% in the 1970s to 9% today, which\nis admirable. But child poverty has risen over that same period, from 16% to\n19%.\n\nThe \u201cdemo\u201d in democratic is failing us, as seniors vote seniors into office\nwho then vote themselves more money. With neither age limits nor term limits,\nand incumbent reelection rates over 90%, congressional seats have become\nlifetime appointments. Nancy Pelosi may be the sharpest 83-year-old in\nCongress, but her time has passed: She has a daughter who was born during the\nJohnson administration, when less than one-third of homes had a color TV. Does\nour leadership really relate to the challenges facing a 15-year-old girl being\nsent messages on extreme dieting by Meta, or the budding addiction crisis of\nyoung men on phone-based gambling apps? We need churn to recalibrate and\ntransfer wealth, but it\u2019s been dampened with retardants that cost trillions.\nD.C. has become a cross between The Walking Dead and The Golden Girls \u2014 its\ndenizens see the living (young) as nutrition, vs. the future.\n\n#### Minotaurs\n\nTo appease King Minos of Crete, ancient Athens sacrificed seven young men and\nseven young women to the Minotaur he kept under his palace. Then Theseus slew\nthe Minotaur. Today in America, we\u2019re offering an entire generation to the\nMinotaurs of Big Tech, and our Theseus, Congress, can only stand by and make\nspeeches. Teen depression and self-harm, bullying, loneliness, and obesity\nhave shot up since social media began haunting them 24/7. Since 2017, Congress\nhas held 40 hearings on children and social media and passed nothing to\naddress the problem. Democrats and Republicans have introduced legislation,\nincluding to age-gate social and to reform Section 230 (which immunizes\ninternet platforms from most litigation), but nothing gets done. At the last\ndramatic reading of what ails us, Senator Dick Durbin admitted to failure:\n\u201cThe tech industry alone is not to blame for the situation we\u2019re in. Those of\nus in Congress need to look in the mirror.\u201d We need to make tech platforms\nliable for the harms they cause; we should eliminate Section 230\u2019s liability\nshield for algorithmically elevated content \u2014 freedom of speech isn\u2019t free.\n\n#### Buck Stops\n\nThe U.S. is the 10th-happiest country in the world for people over 60, and the\n62nd-happiest for people under 30. Young people are economically\ndisadvantaged, threatened by climate change, and voiceless thanks to our\ndysfunctional politics. And they\u2019ve been manipulated from childhood by a toxic\ncocktail of paleolithic instincts, medieval institutions, and godlike\ntechnology. We have broken the social contract, and younger generations aren\u2019t\ngoing to fulfill their end of it. In 1993, 60% of 30- to 34-year-olds had at\nleast one child. Today that number is 27%. Young people aren\u2019t meeting or\nmating, and the consequences will be dire. Young people\u2019s labor powers the\neconomy, and their taxes pay for the services consumed by old people. Without\nrobust youth employment, Social Security will go bankrupt, debt service will\nconsume the federal budget, and the commonwealth will collapse. We\u2019ve created\na future so unappealing, youth is opting out.\n\n#### Fixable\n\nThe incumbents will throw their arms up like an 8-year-old who refuses to take\nresponsibility. The plea of complexity is an illusion \u2014 every problem we have\nlevied on young people can be addressed. We have the hard part figured out:\nhow to grow the economy at a sustained rate to pay for programs that might\nturn things around. Here are just a few programs and fixes we could try.\n\nI had my first child at 42, and it changed my life. I became more responsible,\nfocused, concerned about the future, and empathetic. In sum, I became a better\nAmerican. Children make us better. We care for our kids, but do we love\nchildren? Somewhere along the way, we lost the script as a society. If we have\nthe resources to address these issues \u2014 and we do: Nvidia added a quarter of a\ntrillion to the economy in 5 minutes post-earnings \u2014 but continue to look the\nother way, then we have to ask: Is America worth investing in? And do we\nreally love our children?\n\nLife is so rich,\n\nP.S. On our latest Prof G Markets episode we discuss ByteDance and events\nbetting. Listen here and tune in every Monday.\n\nP.P.S.

Chris Volk says:\n\n10 mins ago at 2:43 pm\n\nAs a baby boomer born of a veteran, I took the option of not joining the\nmilitary. But now I believe that a national service requirement is important.\nIt would do much to unify our country. And certainly those who fought for\nAmerica in WW II were highly unified. The loss of such a requirement has need\nAmerica less great.\n\nMeanwhile an add to your comments on education funding. In Arizona, where we\nlive, a succession of governors lowered the personal tax rate. It was popular,\nbut a victim was higher education, which received less funding. So,\npoliticians were able to crow about lowering taxes, while students had to make\nup some of the difference through student debt. So, the reduction of taxes was\nnot due to a lower burden. Often the societal burden was just shifted to the\nless affluent and those starting out in life. But they had no one to lobby for\nthem or to point out the moral failing inherent in this tax policy.\n\nReply\n\n  2.

As\na baby boomer, I cannot deny the truth of the piece.\n\nWhen social media emerged, too many people became intoxicated with the notion\nof a megaphone for everyone as if that could cure society\u2019s ills and\ninjustices. All I could think was, people have not evolved far enough to be\nready for this. Nothing good can come of it.\n\nReply\n\n  8. Chuck says:\n\n1 hour ago at 1:49 pm\n\nThank you Scott for the insight.
