The objective is to establish a new\nforum for the Dutch Data Systems community to unite, foster collaborations\nbetween its members, and bring in high-quality international speakers. We\nwould like to invite all researchers, especially PhD students, who are working\non related topics to join the events. It is an excellent opportunity to\nreceive feedback early on from researchers in your field. Website:\nhttps://dsdsd.da.cwi.nl/ X: https://x.com/dsdsdnl Speaker: Pedro Holanda\nTitle: Efficient CSV Parsing: On the Complexity of Simple Things Abstract: In\nthis talk, we will revisit different CSV parsing implementations in DuckDB and\ncompare them with the current implementation. The bulk of the talk is to\ndiscuss the design and implementation decisions in DuckDB's current CSV\nParser. In particular, we will examine the parallel algorithm, the CSV buffer\nmanager, and the transitions of the CSV state machine. Disclaimer: This talk\nis not for the faint of heart; some very exotically built CSV files will be\ndepicted. Bio: Pedro is an early contributor to DuckDB and currently works as\na software engineer at DuckDB Labs, focusing on core and integration aspects\nof DBMS technology. He completed his PhD at the Database Architectures group\nat CWI, researching Indexes for Interactive Data Analysis.\n\nShow less Show more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### DSDSD - Dutch Seminar on Data Systems Design\n\n471 subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\n## Comments\n\nTop comments\n\nNewest first\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# Efficient CSV Parsing - On the Complexity of Simple Things - Pedro Holanda\n\nDSDSD - Dutch Seminar on Data Systems Design\n\nDSDSD - Dutch Seminar on Data Systems Design\n\n471 subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n834 views 2 weeks ago\n\n834 views \u2022 Apr 9, 2024\n\nShow less\n\nDSDSD - THE DUTCH SEMINAR ON DATA SYSTEMS DESIGN: We hold bi-weekly talks on\nFridays from 3:30 PM to 5 PM CET for and by researchers and practitioners\ndesigning (and implementing) data systems.
