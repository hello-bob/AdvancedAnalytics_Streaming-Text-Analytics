McCloud previewed the book at the August 1992 Comics Arts\nConference.^[8]\n\nUnderstanding Comics was first published by Tundra Publishing; reprintings\nhave been released by Kitchen Sink Press, DC Comics' Paradox Press, DC's\nVertigo line, and HarperPerennial.

An attempt to formalize the\nstudy of comics, it is itself in comics form.\n\nThe book's overarching argument is that comics are defined by the primacy of\nsequences of images.^[9] McCloud also introduced the concept of \"closure\" to\nrefer to a reader's role in closing narrative gaps between comics panels.^[10]\nThe book argues that comics employ nonlinear narratives because they rely on\nthe reader's choices and interactions.\n\nThe book begins with a discussion of the concept of visual literacy and a\nhistory of narrative in visual media. McCloud mentions, among other early\nworks of graphic narrative, the Bayeux Tapestry, as an antecedent to comics.\nUnderstanding Comics posits Swiss caricaturist Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer as in many\nways \"the father of the modern comic\". McCloud emphasizes T\u00f6pffer's use of\n\"cartooning and panel borders\" along with \"the first interdependent\ncombination of words and pictures seen in Europe\".^[11]\n\nMcCloud also highlights the differences between iconic and realistic figures.\nIconic figures can be compared to a standard cartoon, while realistic figures\nfocus more on photo-quality in terms of detail. He states that Western culture\nis captivated by iconic images more so due to their simplicity. He provides a\nfull comparison and breakdown of iconic and realistic images and gives an\ninteresting explanation of his reasoning behind this statement.\n\nOne of the book's key concepts is that of \"masking\", a visual style, dramatic\nconvention, and literary technique described in the chapter on realism. It is\nthe use of simplistic, archetypal, narrative characters, even if juxtaposed\nwith detailed, photographic, verisimilar, spectacular backgrounds. This may\nfunction, McCloud infers, as a mask, a form of projective identification. His\nexplanation is that a familiar and minimally detailed character allows for a\nstronger emotional connection and for viewers to identify more easily.\n\nOne of the book's concepts is \"The Big Triangle\", a tool for thinking about\ndifferent styles of comics art. McCloud places the realistic representation in\nthe bottom left corner, with iconic representation, or cartoony art, in the\nbottom right, and a third identifier, abstraction of image, at the apex of the\ntriangle. This allows placement and grouping of artists by triangulation.\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\nUnderstanding Comics won multiple Harvey Awards in 1994 for Best Graphic\nAlbum/Original Material^[12] and Best Biographical, Historical or Journalistic\nPresentation.^[12] In addition, McCloud won the 1994 Harvey Award for Best\nWriter.^[12]\n\nUnderstanding Comics won the 1994 Eisner Award for Best Comics-Related\nBook.^[13]\n\nAuthor McCloud won the 1994 Adamson Award for Best International Comic-Strip\n[or comic book] Cartoonist. The book was a finalist for the 1994 Hugo Award\nfor Best Non-Fiction Book.\n\nThe Swedish translation of the book, Serier: Den Osynliga Konsten, published\nin 1995 by H\u00e4ftad, was awarded the 1996 Urhunden Prize.\n\nThe French translation of the book, titled L'Art invisible and published by\nVertige Graphic, won the Prix Bloody Mary at the 2000 Angoul\u00eame International\nComics Festival. In addition, it was nominated for that year's Angoul\u00eame\nInternational Comics Festival Prize for Best Album.\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\nAlong with Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art, Understanding Comics is\nconsidered to form the foundations for formal comics studies in English.^[14]\n\nThe book was called \"one of the most insightful books about designing graphic\nuser interfaces ever written\" by Apple Macintosh co-creator Andy\nHertzfeld.^[15]^[undue weight? \u2013 discuss]\n\n## Parodies[edit]\n\nUnderstanding Comics was parodied by Dylan Sisson in his Filibusting Comics:\nThe Next Chapter, published by Fantagraphics in 1995, and later translated\ninto Spanish.^[16]\n\nIt was parodied again, in Tim Heiderich and Mike Rosen's Misunderstanding\nComics, self-published via Kickstarter in 2012.^[17]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Comics and Sequential Art, an earlier book by Will Eisner on the same subject\n  * Comics studies\n  * \"How to Read Nancy\", an essay by Mark Newgarden and Paul Karasik\n  * Masking (illustration)\n  * Sequential art\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Brooks, Kevin (2009). \"More 'Seriously Visible' Reading: McCloud, McLuhan, and the Visual Language of \"The Medium Is the Massage\"\".
