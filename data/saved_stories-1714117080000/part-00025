She is also the host of\nHell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and\nAudible Originals.\n\nApr 25, 2024, 4:56 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nEPA administrator Michael Regan during the EPA\u2019s \u201cJourney to Justice\u201d tour on\nNovember 16th, 2021.\n\nUSEPA photo by Eric Vance\n\nEPA administrator Michael Regan during the EPA\u2019s \u201cJourney to Justice\u201d tour on\nNovember 16th, 2021.\n\nUSEPA photo by Eric Vance\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency rolled out new rules today meant to crack\ndown on pollution from power plants. It forces existing coal-fired power\nplants and newly built gas plants to capture nearly all of their planet-\nheating carbon dioxide emissions. The agency also set new limits on mercury\nemissions, water pollution, and coal ash from power plants.\n\nEnvironmental and health advocates, however, are still waiting for the EPA to\nfinalize rules for existing gas-fired power plants, which are the biggest\nsource of electricity in the US. The Verge spoke with Regan about what comes\nnext \u2014 from the looming presidential election to what technologies could be\nused to clean up the power grid and how to get communities more involved in\nthe process.\n\n\u201cWe all understand the sense of urgency\u201d\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nThe US generates more electricity from gas than any other source of energy.\nBut the EPA\u2019s new rules for power plant emissions don\u2019t include existing gas-\nfired power plants.\n\nThe EPA says it\u2019s delaying its decision to strengthen those rules, but that\nrisks potentially leaving the policy up to another Trump administration.\nWhat\u2019s so important that it\u2019s worth slowing down and taking that gamble?\n\nI think it\u2019s a universal view shared not only by the EPA but by the\nenvironmental justice community, the environmental community, as well as\nindustry. In addition to just looking at carbon reductions, the environmental\njustice community, the environmental community, also asked us to look at\nreducing toxic pollution as well.\n\nWe wanted to listen to our stakeholders, recognizing that we all understand\nthe sense of urgency. But also adhering to the fact that we could do better.\nWe can be more comprehensive. We can ensure that there were control\ntechnologies considered other than carbon capture and storage, which the\nenvironmental justice community asked us to do. And we also thought that this\nis a more strategic and impactful way to look at the existing gas universe in\nits entirety. So we believe that while recognizing the sense of urgency,\ncollectively, there is an opportunity to get even more pollution reduction\nfrom existing gas sources.\n\n### Related\n\n  * The EPA\u2019s new power plant pollution rule has a big, gassy hole in it\n  * Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm on cleaning up \u2018clean\u2019 energy\n\nHow might you achieve those additional pollution reductions? How might the new\nrule for existing gas plants look different from what the EPA initially\nproposed last year?\n\nWe\u2019re in the process of evaluating different combinations of control\ntechnologies \u2014 looking at the reliance on renewable energy, battery storage.\nWe\u2019re looking at and strongly evaluating best management practices for\npollution reduction. Listen, the bottom line is a lot of these existing gas\nplants reside in close proximity to communities that have been\ndisproportionately impacted for far too long. And so they want a more\nthoughtful and inclusive process on different types of approaches to reduce\nclimate pollutants and toxic pollution. And they also want to better\nunderstand CCS technology \u2014 how all of these things will also impact their\ncommunities directly. So with this extended timeframe, we are maximizing the\nopportunity to be transparent, to take a closer look at all of the options on\nthe table to reduce not just carbon but toxic pollution, and explain to the\ncommunities the choices that we\u2019re making and the overall impact that it will\nhave on their communities.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision on West Virginia v. EPA last June essentially said\nthat the EPA can\u2019t regulate greenhouse gas emissions in a way that determines\nwhat sources of energy the US uses. How big of a blow was that ruling for\ntackling climate change and the health effects from power plant pollution?\n\nLet me just say that I feel very strongly that we are following the science\nand following the law. We have really measured twice and we\u2019re cutting once.\nWe recognize that the Supreme Court has spoken on past cases. The fact of the\nmatter is that we have learned from the results of previous court cases, and\nwe\u2019re applying that knowledge moving forward. The four separate standards that\nwe are issuing today are done in a very strategic manner that is consistent\nwith the law and consistent with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and\nall of our cleanup statutes as well.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly that we are following the science and following the\nlaw.\u201d\n\nToday, we\u2019re laying that suite of standards out so that the industry has\nadequate time to prepare for investment and strategic planning in a way that\nwill comply with these rules in a very cost-effective manner. We know that\nbased on our analysis and evaluation, this does not disrupt reliability, nor\ndoes it inflate prices, and so we feel really good. We\u2019ve taken our time, and\ntoday is a really big day for the Biden administration.\n\nI spoke to a woman last night from Newark, New Jersey. She lives in a\nneighborhood with three power plants within four square miles. She says\nthey\u2019re counting on you, that there are real lives at stake.\n\nHer name is Maria Lopez-Nu\u00f1ez. She wants the EPA to consider the cumulative\nimpacts of multiple industrial facilities and multiple pollutants \u2014 not just\ncarbon dioxide \u2014 that impact the community. Is that something you\u2019ll do with\nthis new power plant rule?\n\nThat\u2019s something that we are doing. When you look at these four rules, we are\ntackling climate pollution. We are ensuring that the wastewater that\u2019s\ndischarged from those various plants in our neighborhood is not allowed to be\nput into the rivers and streams. We are ensuring that the mercury that comes\nfrom this coal doesn\u2019t bioaccumulate in the fish that folks in the\nneighborhood might want to use for recreational purposes. Coal ash that has\nbeen stored in their communities in these unlined pits that are saturating the\ngroundwater and drinking water, we\u2019re putting a stop to that. Today, we are\ndirectly addressing those concerns that we\u2019ve heard from her and from other\nmembers in communities all across the country. This is a very comprehensive\napproach. It\u2019s an approach designed to tackle the pollution coming from our\npower sector. And again, it\u2019s a smart approach that doesn\u2019t compromise\nreliability or cost.\n\nAnd what about the forthcoming rule for existing gas plants?\n\nOne of the reasons we\u2019re taking more time is so that, as we tackle existing\ngas plants, we look at carbon, we look at nitrogen oxides, and we look at some\nof the toxins that are coming from these plants. So yes, we are looking at\nmultiple pollutants that we can control by taking a little bit more time as\nthe community \u2014 the environmental justice community and the environmental\ncommunity \u2014 have asked us to do.\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is an umbrella term for a suite of\ntechnologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources\nincluding power plants, refineries, and factories. The goal is to capture\ncarbon dioxide before it escapes into the air and then store it away to keep\nit from entering the atmosphere. But there are still concerns about its\nsafety, costs, and potential to prolong the use of fossil fuels.\n\nMaria and other advocates I\u2019ve spoken to are also worried about carbon\ncapture. This doesn\u2019t clean up other kinds of pollution, and it prolongs\ndependence on fossil fuels, they say. Do you think the new rule for existing\ngas plants should still rely on carbon capture?\n\nWe are listening to Maria and others, which is why we are taking this second\nstep. That is why we\u2019re going through a very transparent process. We\u2019re\nlistening to the public. And we\u2019re going to go on this journey together to\nensure that the suite of options that we deem viable for existing sources\ntakes into account the concerns that have been raised by the environmental\ncommunity and the environmental justice community. We\u2019re listening, and we\nhear Maria and her cohorts loud and clear.\n\nSo far, the EPA has only opened up a nonregulatory docket to gather input on a\nnew emissions rule for existing gas plants, which sounds like it isn\u2019t tied to\nany specific rulemaking. Can you explain why that\u2019s a nonregulatory docket and\nwhat the next steps are to reach a final rule for existing power plants? Is\nthere any chance this rule could get done before the election?\n\n\u201cFor far too long, low-income communities of color and tribal communities have\nbeen disproportionately impacted by pollution from the power sector\u201d\n\nThe process is underway, and I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the first step.\nThere are multiple steps that are a part of any rulemaking process, and I can\nassure you that the actions that we take to rein in the carbon pollution and\ntoxic pollution from existing gas sources will go through the appropriate\nprocess that can withstand court challenges but also follow the science and\nfollow the law.\n\nI\u2019ve heard you speak really passionately over the years about environmental\njustice and ending the legacy of fossil fuels disproportionately polluting\ncommunities of color and low-income neighborhoods. How do you reconcile that\nwith the US still producing record amounts of oil and gas?\n\nI think that it\u2019s fair to say that President Biden has set the agenda.\nLeadership starts at the top, and he is the president that at least twice has\nsaid during the State of the Union address that environmental justice is a top\npriority for all of us. It goes without saying that, for far too long, low-\nincome communities of color and tribal communities have been\ndisproportionately impacted by pollution from the power sector and the\nchemical sector. What we\u2019ve pledged is that we would apply our regulations\nequally under the law to protect everyone in this country, especially those\nwho are disproportionately impacted or most vulnerable.\n\nI took that Journey to Justice tour throughout the country, starting in the\nSoutheast United States. When you spend time with families who have been\nimpacted by cancer for multiple generations, when you see how close some of\nthese homes are to chemical facilities and coal ash dump sites, you quickly\nrealize that there are things that we can do, that we must do, that the\npresident has asked us to do. That\u2019s exactly what this EPA is doing.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## What happens after your country runs on 99 percent renewable electricity?\n\n  2. ## Biden signs TikTok \u2018ban\u2019 bill into law, starting the clock for ByteDance to divest it\n\n  3. ## A morning with the Rabbit R1: a fun, funky, unfinished AI gadget\n\n  4. ## Framework won\u2019t be just a laptop company anymore\n\n  5. ## Steam will stop issuing refunds if you play two hours of a game before launch day\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Science\n\n  * ### The EPA\u2019s new power plant pollution rule has a big, gassy hole in it\n\n  * ### What happens after your country runs on 99 percent renewable electricity?\n\n  * ### How 14 tribes plan to use the Biden administration\u2019s solar grants\n\n  * ### Asia is officially the most \u2018disaster-prone\u2019 region in the world\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
