Now you can focus on what you do\nbest: writing outstanding code. Each time you push a change to your GitHub\nrepository, it will be deployed to your WordPress.com site automatically or\nupon request.\n\nUse GitHub Deployments\n\nCheck out this video overview from Paulo Trentin, one of the developers who\nworked on this feature:\n\nHere are three reasons why we know you\u2019re going to love GitHub Deployments on\nWordPress.com:\n\n## 1\\. A streamlined workflow\n\nGitHub Deployments help you manage your site\u2019s code in a reliable,\npredictable, and automated way using version control instead of older or\nmanual mechanisms, such as FTP or SSH tools. In its simplest form, it doesn\u2019t\nrequire a workflow file like our previous GitHub integration, which relied on\na GitHub action; instead, you can connect and deploy in just a few clicks, all\nwithin your WordPress.com dashboard.\n\nThis is a welcome change for developers who want to simplify their code\ndeployment process and migrate away from the manual operations and error-prone\nnature of SFTP and SSH transfers.\n\nGitHub Deployments also allows you to connect multiple repositories to a\nsingle site, encouraging code reusability between the sites you manage. Want\nto deploy a plugin or theme to multiple sites with a single branch push? Have\nat it! Want to manage your entire site\u2019s code from a GitHub repository? We\u2019ve\ngot you covered!\n\n## 2\\. Run checks and tasks\n\nGitHub Deployments also gives you the power to process files and run tasks\nbefore transferring the files to your WordPress.com site through GitHub\nworkflows. This helps ensure that all team members publish code following your\nchosen patterns and expectations, for example.\n\nIf that\u2019s your thing, you can install Composer dependencies and run any\ncommand supported by GitHub actions prior to sending any code updates to your\nsite. Find a few of our favorite workflow recipes here.\n\nThree cheers for unified, well-written code!\n\n## 3\\. Deploy the way you want\n\nYou can adjust the deployment settings for each repository, giving you\ncomplete control over how your code is shipped.\n\nYou can choose to automatically deploy changes to your WordPress.com site as\nsoon as code is committed to your repository, or you can request deployments\nmanually. Manual deployments give you the most control over when your code\nchanges are pushed live, as you\u2019ll use the GitHub Deployments interface to\ntrigger a deployment. We recommend manual deployments if you don\u2019t want to use\na staging site.\n\nIn general, automatic deployments are not recommended for live production\nsites, as any changes to the code in the repository are automatically deployed\nfrom GitHub to the live site. Instead, you may decide to automatically deploy\nfirst to a staging site and then sync the staging site to production once\nyou\u2019re ready.\n\nThat said, choose your own adventure and deploy on your own terms.\n\n## Do your thing, and we\u2019ll handle the rest\n\nDevelopment on WordPress.com has never been easier. Say goodbye to manual\ndeployments and hello to more efficient collaboration, streamlined version\ncontrol, and the peace of mind that comes with knowing your project data is\nsecure.\n\nGet instant access to our new GitHub Deployments with a Creator or\nEntrepreneur plan (did you know we have a 14-day refund policy?).\n\nReady to try GitHub Deployments out for yourself?
