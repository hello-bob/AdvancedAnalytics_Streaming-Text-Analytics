For years they have lived underground,\nsoft milky-white nymphs nursed by endosymbiotic bacteria through their long\nhelpless infancy. And then, as if by some divine signal, when the soil\ntemperature reaches exactly 17.9 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), an obsidian exoskeleton encases\ntheir bodies in a flash to accompany them through the brief weeks of maturity\nas they rise from the underworld in singing search of a mate.\n\nIn consonance with pioneering astronomer Maria Mitchell\u2019s insistence that\n\u201cevery formula which expresses a law of nature is a hymn of praise to God,\u201d we\nnow have a formula for predicting when this massive music festival of yearning\nwill begin: E = (19.465 \u2013 t)/0.5136, where E denotes the emergence start date\nin May and t is the average April temperatures in Celsius.\n\nBy early June, they have all emerged, more of them than all the humans who\nhave ever lived; by late July, they have all died.\n\nTransformation of the periodical Cicada Septemdecim. Illustration by Lillie\nSullivan, 1898. (Available as a print and as stationery cards, benefitting The\nNature Conservancy.)\n\nWhile annual cicada species cover the globe, periodical cicadas \u2014 the seven\nknown species of the genus Magicicada, which emerge from the ground every 13\nor 17 years in broods defined by geography and periodicity \u2014 are native only\nto North America. The English were staggered to encounter them when they first\narrived. In 1633, the the governor of the young Plymouth Colony in New England\nmarveled at the \u201cnumerous company of Flies which were like for bigness unto\nwasps or Bumble-Bees\u201d that rose from the ground to feast on the trees and\n\u201cmade such a constant yelling noise as made the woods ring of them, and ready\nto deafen the hearers.\u201d\n\nCicada by Edward Donovan, 1800. (Available as a print and as stationery cards,\nbenefitting The Nature Conservancy.)\n\nDespite having no voice \u2014 no vocal chords, no lungs \u2014 cicadas are the loudest\nmale chorus on Earth, their courtship serenades approaching the decibel level\nof a jet engine thanks to some of the most extraordinary acoustics in nature.\n\nThe body of a male cicada resembles a wood instrument. On each side of the\nhollow abdomen is a tymbal \u2014 a mesh of miniature ribs woven into a hard\nmembrane, strummed whenever the singer flexes his synchronous flight muscles.\nUnlike locusts, which make sound by rubbing their legs against their wings and\nwith which they were long conflated \u2014 it was only in the tenth edition of his\nSystema Naturae that Linnaeus named the cicada as a different insect \u2014 cicadas\nsing the way humans do: with their whole body.\n\nArt from A Monograph of Oriental Cicadid\u00e6 by William Lucas Distant, 1889.\n(Available as a print and as stationery cards, benefitting The Nature\nConservancy.)\n\nSome find their music menacing, some mesmerizing. The Greeks considered it\nalmost divine. When Pythagoras discovered the mathematics of harmony, a cicada\nsitting on a harp came to symbolize the science of music. Homer\u2019s highest\npraise for orators was to compare them to cicadas. Anacreon, celebrated as the\nfinest lyric poet of his civilization, reverenced them in verse:\n\n> Sweet prophet of summer, loved of the Muses, Beloved of Phoebus who gave\n> thee thy shrill song, Old age does not wear upon thee; Thou art earth-born,\n> musical, impassive, without blood. Thou art almost a god.\n\nEpochs later, Lord Byron \u2014 poet laureate of the grandiose, otherwise blind to\nthe grandeur of smallness \u2014 rhapsodized about these tiny \u201cpeople of the pine\u201d\nthat \u201cmake their summer lives one ceaseless song.\u201d\n\nBut no one has written more poetically about the biological reality of the\ncicada than the artist, naturalist, philosopher, entomologist, and educator\nAnna Botsford Comstock (September 1, 1854\u2013August 24, 1930) \u2014 the forgotten\npioneer who planted the seed for the youth climate action movement by\nintroducing nature study to school curricula at the dawn of the twentieth\ncentury, making wonder a public good.\n\nAnna Botsford Comstock circa 1900\n\nIn 1903, Comstock wrote and illustrated Ways of the Six-Footed (public library | public domain) \u2014 a lyrical field guide to the world of insects, doing for entomology what Carl Sagan would do for astronomy two generations later. Celebrating the commonest male cicada of summer as the greatest of \u201cthe insect troubadours,\u201d Comstock writes:\n\n> This musician... is an interesting-looking fellow, with a stout body and\n> broad, transparent wings quite ornately veined... The cicada whose song is\n> the most familiar to us is the \u201cdog-day harvest-fly\u201d or \u201cLyreman.\u201d It\n> resembles the seventeen-year species, except that it is larger and requires\n> only two or three years in the immature state, below ground, instead of\n> seventeen. The Lyreman when seen from above is black, with dull-green scroll\n> ornamentation; below he is covered with white powder. He lives in trees;\n> hidden beneath the leaves, this arboreal wooer sends forth a high trill,\n> which seems to steep the senses of the listener in the essence of summer\n> noons. If you chance to find a Lyreman fallen from his perch and take him in\n> your hand, he will sing and you can feel his body vibrate with the sound.\n> But it will remain a mystery where the musical instrument is situated, for\n> it is nowhere visible to the uninitiated. However, if you place him on his\n> back, you may see directly behind the base of each hind leg a circular\n> plate, nearly a quarter of an inch in diameter; beneath each of these plates\n> is a cavity across which is stretched a partition made up of three distinct\n> kinds of membranes for the modulation of the tone; at the top of each cavity\n> is a stiff, folded membrane which acts as a drumhead; but it is set In\n> vibration by muscles instead of drumsticks, and these muscles move so\n> rapidly that we cannot distinguish the separate vibrations. Thus, our\n> Lyreman is provided with a very complicated pair of kettledrums, which he\n> plays with so much skill that his music sounds more like that of a mandolin\n> than of a drum.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> Surely a new interest attaches to this summer-day song when we realize that\n> it has pleased the human ear since the dim age of Homer. The cicada\u2019s\n> kettledrums are perhaps the only musical instruments now in use that have\n> remained unchanged through a thousand centuries since they were first\n> mentioned.\n\nCicada speciosa by Charles Dessalines d\u2019Orbigny, 1861. (Available as a print\nand as stationery cards, benefitting The Nature Conservancy.)\n\nComplement with the poetic physicist Alan Lightman on music as a property of\nthe universe and this lovely vintage parable about another music-making\ninsect, then revisit Anna Botsford Comstock\u2019s beautiful meditation on winter\ntrees as a portal to aliveness.\n\n# donating = loving\n\nEvery month, I spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars keeping The\nMarginalian going.
