We appreciate\nyour feedback and contributions. Check out our CONTRIBUTING.md for more\ndetails on how to contribute.\n\nThe main functionalities of Sinergym are the following:\n\n  * Simulation Engine Compatibility: Uses EnergyPlus Python API for Python-EnergyPlus communication. Future plans include more engines like OpenModelica.\n\n  * Benchmark Environments: Designs environments for benchmarking and testing deep RL algorithms or other external strategies, similar to Atari or Mujoco.\n\n  * Customizable Environments: Allows easy modification of experimental settings. Users can create their own environments or modify pre-configured ones in Sinergym.\n\n  * Customizable Components: Enables creation of new custom components for new environments, making Sinergym scalable, such as function rewards, wrappers, controllers, etc.\n\n  * Automatic Building Model Adaptation: Sinergym automates the process of adapting the building model to user changes in the environment definition.\n\n  * Automatic Actuators Control: Controls actuators through the Gymnasium interface based on user specification, only actuators names are required and Sinergym will do the rest.\n\n  * Extensive Environment Information: Provides comprehensive information about Sinergym background components from the environment interface.\n\n  * Stable Baseline 3 Integration: Customizes functionalities for easy testing of environments with SB3 algorithms, such as callbacks and customizable training real-time logging. However, Sinergym is agnostic to any DRL algorithm.\n\n  * Google Cloud Integration: Offers guidance on using Sinergym with Google Cloud infrastructure.\n\n  * Weights & Biases Compatibility: Automates and facilitates training, reproducibility, and comparison of agents in simulation-based building control problems. WandB assists in managing and monitoring model lifecycle.\n\n  * Notebook Examples: Provides code in notebook format for user familiarity with the tool.\n\n  * Extensive Documentation, Unit Tests, and GitHub Actions Workflows: Ensures Sinergym is an efficient ecosystem for understanding and development.\n\n  * And much more!\n\nThis is a project in active development. Stay tuned for upcoming releases.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThis repository is organized into the following directories:\n\n  * sinergym/: Contains the source code for Sinergym, including the environment, modeling, simulator, and tools such as wrappers and reward functions.\n  * docs/: Online documentation generated with Sphinx and using Restructured Text (RST).\n  * examples/: Jupyter notebooks illustrating use cases with Sinergym.\n  * tests/: Unit tests for Sinergym to ensure stability.\n  * scripts/: Scripts for various tasks such as agent training and performance checks, allowing configuration using JSON format.\n\n## Available Environments\n\nFor a complete and up-to-date list of available environments, please refer to\nour documentation.\n\n## Installation\n\nPlease visit INSTALL.md for detailed installation instructions.\n\n## Usage example\n\nIf you used our Dockerfile during installation, you should have the try_env.py\nfile in your workspace as soon as you enter in. In case you have installed\neverything on your local machine directly, place it inside our cloned\nrepository. In any case, we start from the point that you have at your\ndisposal a terminal with the appropriate python version and Sinergym running\ncorrectly.\n\nSinergym uses the standard Gymnasium API. So a basic loop should look like:\n\n    \n    \n    import gymnasium as gym import sinergym # Create the environment env = gym.make('Eplus-datacenter-mixed-continuous-stochastic-v1') # Initialize the episode obs, info = env.reset() truncated = terminated = False R = 0.0 while not (terminated or truncated): a = env.action_space.sample() # random action selection obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(a) # get new observation and reward R += reward print('Total reward for the episode: %.4f' % R) env.close()\n\nA folder will be created in the working directory after creating the\nenvironment. It will contain the Sinergym outputs produced during the\nsimulation.\n\nFor more examples and details, please visit our usage examples documentation\nsection.\n\n## Google Cloud Platform support\n\nFor more information about this functionality, please, visit our documentation\nhere.\n\n## Projects using Sinergym\n\nThe following are some of the projects benefiting from the advantages of\nSinergym:\n\n  * Demosthen/ActiveRL\n  * VectorInstitute/HV-Ai-C\n  * rdnfn/beobench\n\n\ud83d\udcdd If you want to appear in this list, do not hesitate to send us a PR and\ninclude the following badge in your repository:\n\n## Repo Activity\n\n## Citing Sinergym\n\nIf you use Sinergym in your work, please cite our paper:\n\n    \n    \n    @inproceedings{2021sinergym, title={Sinergym: A Building Simulation and Control Framework for Training Reinforcement Learning Agents}, author={Jim\u00e9nez-Raboso, Javier and Campoy-Nieves, Alejandro and Manjavacas-Lucas, Antonio and G\u00f3mez-Romero, Juan and Molina-Solana, Miguel}, year={2021}, isbn = {9781450391146}, publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery}, address = {New York, NY, USA}, url = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3486611.3488729}, doi = {10.1145/3486611.3488729}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, Cities, and Transportation}, pages = {319\u2013323}, numpages = {5}, }\n\n## About\n\nGym environment for building simulation and control using reinforcement\nlearning\n\nugr-sail.github.io/sinergym/\n\n### Topics\n\npython framework reinforcement-learning simulation energyplus buildings\nbuilding-energy reinforcement-learning-environments building-control\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nCode of conduct\n\n### Citation\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n109 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n7 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n31 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 45\n\nv3.3.0 Latest\n\nApr 3, 2024\n\n\\+ 44 releases\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 9\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 98.2%\n  * Dockerfile 1.8%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
