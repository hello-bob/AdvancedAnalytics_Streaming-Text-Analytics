React or Svelte? Grad school\nor industry? Chocolate or vanilla? Wouldn't it be nice if you could split the\nuniverse in two, so that at least if you didn't make the right decision, you\nknow there's a version of you in another universe that did?\n\nIt might sound crazy, but it takes about 4 seconds to run this circuit, which\nsplits the universe in two and tells you which universe you're in. You can\nlegitimately run it right now.\n\nThis circuit is basically a unix fork(). It measures a qubit that's in the\nstate 21\u22230\u27e9+21\u22231\u27e9. I'm keeping math low in this post, but this just means the\nuniverse makes a 50/50 decision about whether the qubit is a 0 or a 1,\nessentially causing the universe to branch in two. In one branch the readout\nyou see is 0, and in the other the readout is 1. You can determine which\nbranch you're in based on the readout^1, and make your decision based on that.\n\nThere are two caveats:\n\n  * For this to work, IBM's quantum computer must not have any measurement/decoherence errors. This circuit above is laughably small though, and you can run big circuits today and still get coherent results, so this is usually a valid assumption.\n\n  * We're assuming the many-worlds interpretation. But even if you don't believe in many-worlds, I'd argue this is as close as you can get to asking the big man to decide something for you. The outcome provably does not exist until you measure it.^2 The universe is making a decision for you.\n\nThis really works, and it's one of the few useful (maybe) things we can do\nwith quantum computers today. I genuinely think it's a fun & potentially\nmeaningful way to make a decision.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  1. You don't get to choose the readout. You do get to control the probabilities, though. This circuit is 50/50, but you can modify it to produce any other probability split. \u21a9\n\n  2. The GHZ experiment is classic proof, but I prefer the delayed double slit experiment. \u21a9\n\n", "frontpage": true}
