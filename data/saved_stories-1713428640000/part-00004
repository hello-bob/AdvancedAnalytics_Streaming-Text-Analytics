And there are some new designs being\nproposed, but nothing as advanced\" as the projects in the United States, he\nadded.\n\nIn Washington, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill in late\nFebruary to speed up the licensing of advanced nuclear power. The Senate has\nalso passed similar legislation.\n\nLester called the move a \"great step.\"\n\nThe efforts come amid increased recognition of the need to address rising\nenergy demand, due in part to swelling use by data centers.\n\nIn March, Google, Microsoft and steel company Nucor announced a joint venture\nto boost clean energy, including by using advanced nuclear power.\n\nPacificCorp, an energy utility in the western United States, is also studying\nadding nuclear capacity through a partnership with TerraPower.\n\n\"There is that appetite now and people are really interested in nuclear,\" said\nCognet-Dauphin.\n\nBut \"you still need to convince the client,\" he said. \"You need to prove your\nproduct.\"\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nU.S.(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/us), nuclear\nenergy(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/nuclear-energy)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
