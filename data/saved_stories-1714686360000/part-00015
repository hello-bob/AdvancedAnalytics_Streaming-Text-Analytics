I can't\nhelp the multiplying feeling of sadness as I realize that the bot infiltration\nis in full effect now more than ever on Twitter and many other platforms, as I\nbrowse tons of no-context \"breadcrumb-marketing\" posts, based on trending\ntopics, planted to inspire me to search for clues as to what the heck they're\nabout, many of them leading repetitively to KPop music, crypto ads, political\nwackiness, or celebrity news.\n\nIn using apps like Twitter, it's easy to see that the platform is dedicated\nprimarily towards trending topics, but at the same time it's not quite easy to\nfigure out the logic for how and why certain things make their way onto those\nlists of trending topics... Certain accounts seem to magically post and\nreceive instant and prominent placements in our timelines quite frequently,\nwhile the majority of posts on the platform made never see the light of day,\nno matter how valid they are to our interests.\n\nNow I know what you're going to say... Things like \"Of course the platform has\nlost it's way\" and various other comments about the seriousness, arrogance,\nand incompetence of platform leadership, but consider this -- Since Twitter\nhas assumed new leadership, why has it still had a dramatic impact and\ninfluence on how many other social platforms are run? The answer is that\nothers are following it's cues. A big problem results from a lack of\ndifferentiation in technology development. Technology is based on innovation\nby nature. When a dominant and \"virally innovative\" idea emerges these days,\nthere are many that quickly launch similar products in hopes of capturing a\nsegment of it's market share... This perhaps may be the result of a very\ncompetitive technical ecosystem, but in my opinion it results from a lack of\ninnovative original leadership that dominates technology as of late.\n\nIn the early 2000s, many can recall that we had a great tech renaissance that\nlater led to a painful market crash, now affectionately referred to as the\n\"Dot Com Bust\", many very prominent tech products came out of that era,\nincluding Myspace (2003), Facebook (2004), and even Twitter (2006).\n\n+++ Between March 2000 and October 2002, the NASDAQ fell from 5,048 to 1,139,\nerasing nearly all of its gains during the dot-com bubble. By the end of 2001,\nmost publicly traded dot-com companies had failed. - SOURCE: Britannica +++\n\nLooking back, in hindsight from 2024, each of those products were quite\ndistinct, despite having similar purposes as primarily human-centered tools.\nIn those times, there were literally new ideas generated and launched\nfrequently because hosting a concept was as simple as setting up a computer in\none's basement to host a web application. Fast forward to now, where most\napplications are hosted in cloud settings, and when operational costs can soar\novernight if an idea gains popularity, the cost of innovation is primarily\ntied to how much funding each idea maker has. The entry point for creating an\napplication in this day and age is astronomically higher than in the days\nwhere some of our most innovative Internet ideas came about. Just for example,\nTwitter was last sold for about the same price as it costs to buy a full size\nUS military aircraft carrier (~$44 billion), and that doesn't even include the\nmonthly electric bill. As of January 2024, Twitter's market value is estimated\nto be around $12.5 billion dollars, a massive drop in value since it's\npurchase for $44 billion dollars.\n\nIt's confusing to me how Twitter had been run from 2006 until 2010 without\nhaving any ad-selling capability for regular users, and how the app didn't\nstart charging for verification features until 2023. I'm not confused about\nthe \"why\" as much as how they managed to survive without the burgeoning (some\nwould say opportunistic) revenue streams all those years while hosting and\noperational costs surged for the app. Apparently the company had big plans to\nreach their big IPO in 2013, which only lasted for about 10 years, but of\ncourse made a select few shareholders quite rich when the company was\npainfully sold in quite a highly publicized \"shotgun wedding\" (of sorts) in\n2022.\n\nThe underlying story behind it all may be that there were several larger\ncorporate sponsors that contributed to Twitter's growth for years prior to\nit's IPO, and the combination of introducing ads and declining user\nsatisfaction overall led to the decline in the platform's prominence in the\nlong haul. Since 2006, many would also say that the app has declined in terms\nof functionality, utility, and value for pretty much the majority of users\nacross the board, especially if they did not pay for either ads or the more\nrecently introduced verification fees on the platform... In summary, the app\nbegan to press it's (estimated to be currently 368 Million active accounts)\nuser base for profit in order to recoup it's initial $44 Billion purchase\nprice after years of being a no-cost service to average users.\n\nTwitter's net loss in 2010 is reported at -$67.32 million, and now is reported\nto be -$221.41 million. [SOURCE: statistia.com\n(https://www.statista.com/statistics/274 ... f-twitter/)] The only 2\nprofitable (recent years) where Twitter was reported as making an income were\nin 2018 and 2019, a dramatic increase, possibly driven by surging advertising\nrevenue after they began to permit individual (non-corporate) users to run\npaid ads on the platform, while (allegedly) reducing organic reach of non-\nadvertising user accounts. I cite this info as a user who has been on Twitter\nsince 2008 (https://twitter.com/ruffandtuff), paying careful attention to\ndetails concerning organic reach of multiple accounts I ran over many years\nmyself in conjunction with several complaints from numerous other users I've\nobserved in many posts on and off the platform.\n\nBased on the above numbers, it's rather easy for one to assume that\nadvertising revenue generates a lot of revenue for social platforms for a\nshort period of time at least, and that Twitter lost less money annually in\nthe early days of it's operation, but in order to get a better picture of how\ntheir profit & loss works, one would have to look deeply into user\nsatisfaction in correlation to the financial performance of the company...\nErratic ownership aside, I'm fairly certain (although it's just an opinion)\nthat user satisfaction with Twitter was quite high in the early days and has\nrisen and fallen over years until now (2024) where you'll read many\ncomplaining on a regular basis on it's subreddit -\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/\n\nAs advertising platforms and paid verification became normalized on Twitter,\nmany other platforms, like Instagram & even newer TikTok began similar\nservices, while also implementing some of the very same features that\nfrustrated Twitter users over years prior. As a user myself, some of the top\nannoyances on Twitter have been:\n\n1\\. The injection of excess ads as authentic posts in timelines. 2. Regularly\nreceiving useless notifications to keep me logged in to the app, random posts\nfrom accounts I don't follow being displayed. 3. Frequently introducing\nfrustrating functional aspects to the app and pop-ups encouraging users to pay\nfor \"premium\" services. 4. Getting heavily limited and capped views on\noriginal posts & shadow bans. 5. Seeing lots of content we don't desire to see\n(even violent and triggering content) and even making it persist more after\nnumerous attempts to block it. 6. Creating new features that no one asked for\nand modifying navigation to encourage it to be popular/prominent. 7. Modifying\nnavigation frequently and shuffling menu controls to keep users engaged longer\nin apps. 8. Many safety features including \"I don't want to see this\" not work\nproperly. 9. Removing and hobbling the ability to mute/block keywords\n(especially for ad-based content). 10. Seeing the very same trending names and\ntopics stuck on lists very frequently. 11. Making feeds not update properly on\na regular basis. 12. Preventing followers from increasing/growing at all. 13.\nCelebrity accounts getting prioritized visibility over all other user\naccounts.\n\nMany of these annoying things began to become integrated into experiences I\nobserved in many of the social apps I use now, from Instagram to TikTok, to\nwhere now it seems as if all of the large-scale social apps seem to be\nfollowing the same model for how Twitter became a limping shadow of it's\nformer self. Even more annoying are public speeches by application leadership\non platforms (even in front of congress) where a customer-centric commitment\nis presented as if it's a focus of platforms that try to spin the cited\ntactics above as reinforcing a \"user-centered mindset and focus on safety and\ncommunity'. If you truly know the investments a lot of these tech leaders make\ninto their personal salaries by how much the fallout shelters they buy to live\nin cost, you'd know that the value is not going to users almost at all, but\nrather primarily into the pockets of people that invest in and control these\ntech platforms.\n\nI think we've reached a crazy point in our existence... Major companies\n(especially those that earn millions and billions every year) are providing\nproducts and services that are inferior, and often totally dysfunctional in\norder to encourage consumers to pay more money for products that simply\nrestore basic functionality at best... Recently, there was a huge court action\nfiled against dating app maker Match Group, responsible for a lot of the most\npopular online dating apps, further illustrating how opportunism is rampant in\nthe tech industry right now. (CONTEXT: https://www.inc.com/rebecca-barker/matc\n... model.html)\n\nMany of these companies reserve \"fast lanes\" for the highest paying customers\nand friends and family. We get into a precarious situation as individual\nhumans when we make skewed companies like this more money each year... It's\nrewarding elitism, and ignoring the reality that our ability to succeed in\nlife is being subverted. If we are not making a profit to cover our business\nexpenses, it makes no sense to invest in companies that implement overpriced\n\"tiered value\" services and complex success schemes. If tools like Ai work\nbased on our art and posts, the companies behind it are profiting off of us\nwithout reciprocation.\n\nSometimes it's not Imposter Syndrome, these days it's often humans within\ncompanies being disingenuous, opportunistic, hypocritical, deceptive, &\ndishonest.\n\nThe era of content creation for social media is showing signs of cracking, as\nmany realize they weren't really making money, heck if you paid attention to\nstrikes happening over the last few years, many of the actors we though had it\nmade were actually suffering financially after long careers within the\nentertainment industry.\n\nI think in this era, it's becoming more and more important to push back\nagainst hostile technology oppression, and to stop following the glittery\nscripts they tell us we need to concerning how these tools are \"useful\" to us,\nand let the companies that don't live up to their words fail.\n\nAs a musician, I'm over with not being able to just share my work without\nputting a ton of work into each post as if I'm producing a Hollywood-worthy\nshow, especially when that work isn't allowed to circulate properly and\nfairly.\n\nMy job is not to create engaging content for billion dollar earning social\nmedia platform users all day, working for free. My job as a musician and\nentertainer is to show what I've accomplished & what I'm capable of to inspire\nothers to hire & book me for new opportunities, and to inspire others to buy\nand stream my music. Everything else is burnt time in terms of business.\n\nAs we almost all use tech-driven services daily now from Spotify to IOT\ndevices and even consumer entertainment apps like Netflix and social media\nplatforms, many come with monthly and individual fees that steadily rise over\ntime. As these platforms grow, if we evaluate their cost versus value to us as\nindividuals, it's disturbing to see how value shrinks as costs to us as users\nof each platform rise. Our time spent paying for, configuring, posting on and\nworking on content for these platforms is also a cost not easily quantified,\nas they consume a lot of our time on a regular basis too.\n\nWhile many social technology companies & leadership behind those platforms\nconstantly evaluate how to satisfy investor expectations and overhead costs,\nit's all to easy for them to assume that their platform users are seen as\n\"instant cash sources\" rather than as the basis for very operation of these\nplatforms, and that also correlates with how these once innovative technology\nservices rise, thrive, languish, fail, get decommissioned, and then fade away\nso quickly. We frequently cancel and enroll in these services as well, and\nthat is proving to be a very unruly model for predicting success or failure of\nthose technology platforms and business operations.\n\nAs far as innovation goes, it's a crucial time for application designers to\nconsider the effectiveness and design of their products for their user base,\nand in attracting private sponsorship, above the need to please investors...\nAt the time of this post, Twitter has become a private company once again,\nmeaning that most of the activity and efforts put into going public were not\nexactly fruitful for anyone beyond those who were bought out when it was sold,\nand definitely has show little value to it's main asset -- It's user\ncommunity.\n\nWe've seen it before with Myspace, Vine, Friendster, Google Plus, and many\nother technology solutions over time -- Once a user base bails out on a public\nservice or the company behind it, that can well be a funeral it can't come\nback from, to which no one should be taking for granted, it would not only\nmean that $44 billion is completely lost, it would also mean that a vital and\nonce epic public service burns out and fades away completely... A deep loss\nfor everyone involved.\n\nMoe @RUFFANDTUFF Our Sound Is Unlike Anything Else.
