The State of Russia's Defense Industry after Two Years of the\nWar\n\nPhoto: Piet/Adobe Stock\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nReport by Maria Snegovaya, Max Bergmann, Tina Dolbaia, Nick Fenton, and Samuel\nBendett (Contributor)\n\nPublished April 22, 2024\n\nRemote Visualization\n\n### Available Downloads\n\n  * Download the Full Report 3490kb\n\nThis report examines Russia\u2019s evolving defense industrial capabilities and\nlimitations during the second year of the Russia-Ukraine war and analyzes how\nthese changes have affected and will continue to affect battlefield outcomes\nin Ukraine. The report starts with an overview of Russia\u2019s domestic arms\nproduction efforts throughout 2023, followed by a detailed examination of key\nRussian weapons systems (such as tanks, artillery, drones, missiles, and\nelectronic warfare systems) and their changing roles on the battlefield. The\nreport then analyzes Russia\u2019s general procurement dynamics and identifies the\nimported components and weapons categories that Russia\u2019s defense industry has\nparticularly relied on in the second year of the war. This part includes a\ncase study on China to illuminate Russia\u2019s evolving procurement patterns. The\nreport then dives into analysis of the Kremlin\u2019s remaining weaknesses, which\nhave been aggravated by a long war of attrition and which can have both short-\nand long-term effects on its military. The final part of the report assesses\nhow Russia\u2019s performance throughout 2023 and its evolving defense capabilities\nmight be translated into its offensive posture in Ukraine in 2024. This part\nof the report is followed by recommendations to Western policymakers on how to\ncounter the Kremlin\u2019s war effort by capitalizing on the Russian military\u2019s\nexisting vulnerabilities.\n\nThis report is made possible by a grant from Carnegie Corporation of New York.\n\n#### Tags\n\nChina, Europe, Russia, Russia and Eurasia, Defense and Security, and Military\nTechnology\n\nImage\n\n### Maria Snegovaya\n\nSenior Fellow, Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program\n\nImage\n\n### Max Bergmann\n\nDirector, Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program and Stuart Center\n\nImage\n\n### Tina Dolbaia\n\nResearch Associate, Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program\n\nImage\n\n### Nick Fenton\n\nProgram Manager and Research Associate, Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program\n\nImage\n\n### Samuel Bendett (Contributor)\n\nSenior Associate (Non-resident), Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program\n\n### Programs & Projects\n\n  * Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program\n\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies 1616 Rhode Island Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 20036\n\nTel: 202.887.0200 Fax: 202.775.3199\n\n### Media Inquiries\n\n  * H.
