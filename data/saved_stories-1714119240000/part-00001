Motivation is to save battery and prevent pocket heaters when notebooks unhibernate (e.g. lid accidentially opened) and sit at \"Passphrase: \". Only available on efi(4) systems as the timeout is saved as EFI variable; mostly because that's trivial to do, but also because we lack a better mechanism to configure that and persist such data without the root disk.
