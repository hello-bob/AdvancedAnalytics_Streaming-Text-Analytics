This isn\u2019t a manifesto, it\u2019s\nmore like a bunch of random thoughts I can\u2019t get out of my head. I could be\nconvinced they\u2019re all wrong, or that I\u2019m not going far enough. I don\u2019t hate\ndogs and I don\u2019t hate dog owners, but part of me hates everything about dog\nownership.\n\nI grew up with a cat, but no dog. I have always liked animals, and thought\ndogs were particularly adorable with their playfulness and enthusiasm. But I\nnever really understood what it meant to own a dog until just recently when I\ndog-sat a cockapoo for a family member.\n\nI had seen this cockapoo a few times before and it was always just as happy\nand bounding as you\u2019d expect any well-kept dog to be. When I arrived at the\nfamily member\u2019s apartment, the dog jumped all over me and eagerly accepted my\npets, even rolling over on its back to get some belly rubs. My family member\ntold me that I\u2019d have to feed the dog this expensive dry food with tasty\ntreats on top, and that I\u2019d have to walk her four times per day (which seemed\nexcessive, but whatever), but that was about it. She was a great dog and would\nbe easy to deal with.\n\nThe family member left the next morning and the cockapoo immediately fell into\na depression. I say this as someone who is usually baffled when I hear that a\ndog is \u201canxious\u201d or \u201ceager\u201d or \u201cscared,\u201d because honestly dogs always just\nlook happy or sad to me. But even I could tell the cockapoo was miserable. She\nwouldn\u2019t eat, she didn\u2019t want to walk more than a block, she cried\nsporadically, and she slept pretty much every minute of the day I wasn\u2019t\ntaking her for four walks.\n\nAfter two days of this, I texted my relative to ask what to do. In a massive\nblock paragraph, she basically told me to cheer the dog up.\n\nTo which I thought \u2013 how the fuck do I do that?\n\nI was struck by the odd parameters of the dog depression problem. A dog is\nsimultaneously emotionally sophisticated enough to get depressed, but not\nemotionally sophisticated enough to be easily \u201ccheered up.\u201d At least not by a\nstranger.\n\nIt\u2019s a dog. It eats, sleeps, plays, and shits. I already gave her food and she\nwouldn\u2019t eat, she sleeps more than she should, I tried playing catch with her\nand she wouldn\u2019t. At least she was indeed shitting.\n\nAll I could really do was keep trying to get the cockapoo to do all those\nthings, but harder. I gave her more treats, took her on longer walks, and\ntried throwing her ball more. She gulped down the extra treats, walked a bit\nfarther, and at least chased the ball a little bit. Her shitting output\nremained constant.\n\nLiterally minutes after I got the long text from my relative, a different\nrelative called me. This one had been the usual dog-sitter of the cockapoo but\nwas too busy to do it this time. He told me to never tell the cockapoo\u2019s owner\nthat there were any problems because she was neurotic and overly-attached to\nthe dog, and she had already gotten super worried and had called him up and\nasked him to check on the dog.\n\nThis other relative explained to me that the cockapoo got extremely depressed\nevery time her owner left. She would go days without eating, wouldn\u2019t want to\ngo on walks, would sleep all day, etc. His solution was to ignore it and not\ntell the owner anything. The dog wouldn\u2019t starve to death or kill itself, it\nwould just go a few miserable days without food and then get hungry and go\nback to normal.\n\nIntersped in his five-minute explanation was the repeated phrase, \u201cit\u2019s a\ndog.\u201d The cockapoo\u2019s owner apparently didn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s a dog. She\ntreated the animal\u2019s misery as a crisis which required intervention. If I, the\nnew dog-sitter, couldn\u2019t handle the job of cheering the cockapoo up, the owner\ndemanded that my other relative leave his engagement and drive 50 minutes to\ngive the dog food and throw its ball.\n\nI took both of their advices. I kept giving the dog more treats, longer walks,\nand more ball throwing, but I tried not to worry about it too much. After a\nfew days, the dog stopped crying and ate a bit more, but she still didn\u2019t seem\nhappy. I wasn\u2019t sure if I had somehow somewhat succeeded in cheering the dog\nup, or if its depression had naturally run its course.\n\nBut then something else started to bother me.\n\nAfter about three days, the dog started following me everywhere. If I sat on\nthe couch to watch tv, the dog would curl-up under my outstretched legs\nresting on the coffee table. If I sat at the dinner table, it would sit beside\nme, and watch me throughout the entire meal. If I went to the bathroom, it\nwould follow me to the door and wait outside. At night, the dog curled up in\nmy bed and slept beside me. The dog started walking more, and she would almost\nalways perfectly follow my lead; she walked at just the right pace so she\nstayed beside me, neither lagging behind my fast stride, nor pulling ahead. On\nthe rare occasions she got distracted by a smell or other dog, I gently tugged\non her leash and called her name, and she scurried over to me.\n\nI found it kind of creepy.\n\nYes, I know, it\u2019s a dog. But still... I felt like I had been granted a level\nof submissiveness from a sovereign being which I hadn\u2019t earned. All I had done\nwas feed and walk the dog \u2013 and I apparently did this so badly that the dog\nwas massively depressed \u2013 and yet she worshipped me.\n\nI don\u2019t mean that lightly. I was suddenly the center of this dog\u2019s universe. I\ngave her food and water, I brought her to a place where she could piss and\nshit, I was her sole source of stimulation. She followed me around, watched me\neverywhere with her big, baleful eyes, and even while depression-sleeping\nthroughout most of every day, she would always stir and look to me hopefully\nif I made a little too much noise readjusting on the couch. I was this dog\u2019s\neverything.\n\nIt reminded me of that scene from Meet the Parents:\n\n> Jack: Greg, how come you don\u2019t like cats? Greg: I don\u2019t not like cats. I-I\n> just\u2013 I just prefer dogs. I mean, I\u2019m just more of a dog kind of, you\n> know\u2013Come home, wagging their little tails, happy to see you kind of\u2013 Jack:\n> You need that assurance? You prefer an emotionally shallow animal? Greg: I\u2013\n> Jack: You see, Greg, when you yell at a dog, his tail will go between his\n> legs and cover his genitals, his ears will go down. A dog is very easy to\n> break, but cats make you work for their affection. They don\u2019t sell out the\n> way dogs do. Greg: Huh.\n\nBefore I get into a whole explanation of why I find dog ownership disturbing,\nI will note the giant caveat that I\u2019m mostly referring to modern Western dog\nownership. I am not referring to dogs living on farms or in the wilderness,\nespecially dogs which \u201cwork\u201d by herding or protecting animals. Likewise, I\u2019m\nnot referring to seeing eye dogs, bomb sniffing dogs, corpse sniffing dogs, or\nany other dogs which have explicitly established \u201cjobs.\u201d I am mostly\ncriticizing dog owners who keep their pets purely for the pleasure of\nownership.\n\nA Dog\u2019s Life\n\nTo summarize my gut reaction to the psychological state of the owned dog, I\u2019m\ngoing to quote a Reddit comment from u/HavelsOnly which partially inspired\nthis essay:\n\n> The most accurate thing I can say about dogs is I feel sorry for them. My\n> immediate family didn\u2019t own dogs growing up, but my extended family had\n> farms or large acreage plots with 3-5 dogs running around all day.

For some dogs, definitely. For others, probably not.\nBut I want to attempt to explore what life is like for an owned dog and try to\nevaluate its happiness.\n\nNeeds, Pleasures, and Meaning\n\nLet\u2019s try to break down all the life-requirements of a conscious being into\nthree categories \u2013 needs, pleasures, and meaning \u2013 and see how well they are\nprovided to an owned dog.\n\nFirst, needs are the basic requirements for existence, like food, water,\nshelter, and protection.\n\nWith the exceptions of abusive or negligent owners, owned dogs get their needs\nmet. In fact, dogs get their needs met better than pretty much any non-pet\nanimals in the world. Unlike wild animals, dogs aren\u2019t faced with the daily\nlife-and-death struggle for survival. They don\u2019t need to hunt or scrounge for\nfood, they don\u2019t need to worry about a tainted water source, they don\u2019t need\nto evade predators, etc. And unlike farm animals, their deaths almost\ncertainly won\u2019t come at the hands of their owners, especially not in the first\n25% of their max lifespans.\n\nFurthermore, with constant advancements in veterinary tech and modern people\u2019s\ntremendous love of their pets, dogs are more likely than ever to be kept alive\nlong past when they would have succumbed to a medical issue in the wild.\nAnother instance that partially inspired this post was when I asked a dog-\nowning friend what he would do if his pit-bull mix got sick tomorrow and\nneeded expensive surgery, and he responded without hesitation: \u201cI\u2019d empty my\nbank account.\u201d\n\nAside from freak accidents, like getting hit by a car, a dog is pretty much\nguaranteed to get his needs met and survive into old age while owned by a\nhuman. This is an unambiguous benefit of being owned.\n\nSecond, pleasures are short term benefits in a being\u2019s life which often serve\nas subjects of pursuit and rewards.\n\nI\u2019d say most dog owners have a mixed record of fulfilling their dog\u2019s pleasure\n(ignore the innuendo). On the positive side, owned dogs will usually get lots\nof treats, toys, and petting. Especially if there are multiple owners in the\nhouse, a dog is likely to get a decent amount of moment-to-moment attention,\neven just in passing. More variable pleasures include walking, exercise, and\nactive play. Diligent owners will devote significant time to taking their dog\nout of the house to run around, fetch, and hopefully interact with other dogs,\nbut plenty of owners won\u2019t and will leave their dogs perpetually under-\nstimulated at home.\n\nWhere dog owners fall the shortest in providing for their dog\u2019s pleasure is in\n\u2013 again, ignore the innuendo \u2013 sex. By the 2010s, 83% of American dogs were\nneutered, and presumably most other owners do everything they can to\ndiscourage their non-neutered dogs from having sex (which is arguably a worse\nfate for the dog). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say that depriving an\nanimal of an act for which it is biologically programmed to derive the most\nextreme of pleasures is likely detrimental to the animal\u2019s wellbeing. Ask\nyourself: for what other gains would you be willing to give up sex for the\nrest of your life?\n\nThird, meaning is activity and goals which provide long-term value to the\nbeing. Admittedly, it\u2019s hard enough to identify meaning in humans, so it\u2019s\neven harder to do so in dogs, but I\u2019m going to take a shot anyway. But first,\na thought experiment:\n\nImagine that you, a human, were kidnapped by aliens at birth and given an\napproximation of a dog\u2019s life, and a good dog\u2019s life at that. Ignore the\nsubservience, dependence on a superior life form, and all the other\npsychological aspects of being owned and just focus on how you would feel\nabout your material conditions.\n\nYou live in a big building that wasn\u2019t designed for your body type nor size,\nbut is comfortable, warm, and decently spacious. You\u2019re given ample healthy\nfood which tastes good, but you eat the same thing almost every day for months\nstraight. Fortunately, you\u2019re occasionally given cookies or brownies or\nwhatever treat you like. Your alien owners give you little massages and talk\nto you in a friendly way even though you can\u2019t understand them. Most of your\ntime is spent in the big building, but 3-4 times per day you get to walk\naround outside the big alien world where you see other humans walking around\ntoo. Once per day, you go to a nice, open human field where you can play\nsports with other humans and maybe even make some friends. However, your balls\nor ovaries were removed when you were a baby, so you will never have sex, nor\nthe desire to do so.\n\nThat is basically your life. You\u2019re never in danger, you\u2019re treated well, you\nget attention and fun (though not that much), and you\u2019ll probably live into\nyour 90s. Would you want this life?\n\nNo, of course not. You will never have a romantic or sexual partner, you will\nnever have children, you will never write a novel, you will never have a good\njob or start your own company, you will never restore a classic car in your\ndriveway, you will never travel, you will never explore new lifestyles or\nideas, you will never do much of anything beyond the extremely narrow confines\nof the life given to you by the aliens.\n\nIn other words, your life would have no meaning. No profundity. Nothing you\u2019ve\nbuilt. No pride. Nothing to look forward to. No long-term goals. You\u2019d just\nhave existence and temporary pleasures. The massages, toys, and occasional\ncookies would be nice, but they\u2019d get boring super quickly. Even going to the\nfield and playing football with other humans would soon feel repetitious and\nprobably meaningless with nothing behind it. Days would blur together. The\nunconscious void of sleep would be most welcomed. The supposed value of a\nlong, healthy, safe life would start to feel like a curse rather than a\nblessing. You might prefer to be let off the leash and take your chances alone\nin the alien world. You wouldn\u2019t be sure if you could find food or avoid\ngetting hit by alien cars, but at least you\u2019d be striving for something.\n\nOk, that\u2019s a lot of personification of a dog. Dogs obviously don\u2019t have the\nmental capacity that humans do, and aren\u2019t consciously concerned with the\nphilosophy of what makes a good life. But still, I think it\u2019s reasonable to\nsay that dogs have some sort of conception of meaning that rises above moment-\nby-moment pleasures, and that the unfulfillment of this meaning has a negative\neffect on the happiness of dogs. And furthermore, I\u2019d speculate that the vast\nmajority of owned dogs have tragically meaningless lives.\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s start with the dogs that I\u2019m guessing have the most\nmeaningful lives. Imagine a border collie growing up on a ranch. The dog wakes\nup in the morning with a purpose; he herds a flock of sheep. This is his job\nevery day. He keeps the flock intact, rescues stragglers, protects them from\npredators, moves the sheep out to graze, and into shelter at the end of the\nday. This instinct to herd is so ingrained in border collies that they will\nliterally herd human children if given the chance. When not herding, the\nborder collie runs around the vast open acreage of the property, often playing\nwith the other working dogs. At night, the dog\u2019s owner greets him with pets\nand food, and maybe throws a stick around for some fetch.\n\nI imagine this is as much of a fulfilling, meaningful life as a dog can have.\nThe border collie lives with lots of space and an environment for which he is\nsuited. The dog has a daily purpose which keeps him focused and entertained.\nThe dog gains a sense of accomplishment for doing his job well and garners\nwell-deserved praise from his owner. The dog\u2019s food and water are earned\nthrough his work, rather than granted by fiat. The dog has other dogs with\nwhom to play and form relationships. This is a good life.\n\n(Likewise, I grew up with a cat who we let out every morning so he could roam\nthrough acres of woodland where he would hunt mice, climb trees, defend his\nterritory from raccoons, and sometimes fight other cats. At night, Moo would\nbe fed and pet, and would curl up next to my mom in bed. That is probably as\nfulfilling of a life that a cat can have.)\n\nBorder collies are often considered the most intelligent dog breed and are\nnotoriously difficult to own. They\u2019re bred to work and are too smart to settle\nfor weekend trips to the park, so if they\u2019re not given something to do, they\nbecome extremely neurotic and basically go insane from boredom:\n\n> \u201cBorder Collies are extremely creative in their obsessive behaviors. Some\n> stare at balls or other toys, many herd other dogs, children or cars (those\n> that do that don\u2019t live too long). The more creative ones stare at shadows\n> or try to herd the ceiling fan or even clouds. Some convert their caregivers\n> into ball throwing machines. \u201d\n\nMy speculation is that what happens to border collies that don\u2019t grow up on\nranches with flocks of sheep to herd is basically what happens to all dogs,\nalbeit to varying degrees. For border collies, it\u2019s herding; for hounds, it\u2019s\nhunting; for saint bernards, it\u2019s carrying beer kegs; for pit bulls, it\u2019s\nfighting bears. When a dog can\u2019t fulfill its genetically crafted purpose, its\ninborn inclinations become maladaptive neuroses which torture their narrow\nlives. This is the dog equivalent of being cursed to lead a meaningless life.\nIt\u2019s like locking a human in an alien\u2019s apartment and never letting him have a\nfamily, develop a passion, or have any life goals beyond pleasing his\ncoercively established masters.\n\n(And this isn\u2019t even getting into the suitability of environments and climates\nfor particular breeds. There is no way a husky is suited for living anywhere\nbesides a big open, cold expanse. Likewise, a dog that can do this should not\nlive in an apartment.)\n\nIf this is true, then most dogs in the Western world have miserable\nexistences. Their subservience to their owners may very well be a product of\nmeaninglessness and boredom rather than organic appreciation.\n\nThe big counter to all of this is: what if dogs are adapted to be companions\nto humans and therefore gain meaning from their subservient relationship to\nowners?\n\nThat\u2019s probably true to some degree depending on the breed. The easy case is\nlapdogs like shih tzus, chihuahuas, and pugs which have been bred for\ncenturies to serve as low-mobility companions. I can buy that such dogs have\nbeen genetically directed towards gaining fulfillment out of serving and\n\u201cprotecting\u201d a loving human owner. A similar but slightly less plausible case\ncould be made for famously family-oriented dogs like golden retrievers and\nlabrador retrievers. The sheer size of these dogs would suggest a greater\nproclivity for physical activity than even an active family can permit, but\ntheir universal gentleness and playfulness with human children is a good\nindicator of finding meaning in such relationships.\n\nBut even with such breeds we should be careful about falling into wishful\nthinking. Again, the appearance of comfort and subservience may just be a\nproduct of boredom and meaninglessness rather than a true indicator of\nfulfillment. After all, adorable beagles are usually kept as small family\npets, but they\u2019re actually hunting dogs. Even wobbly little dachshunds were\nbred to hunt badgers.\n\nThis could hint at something much darker. What if a lot of these smaller dogs\nwhich are supposedly great for ordinary dog ownership are actually work dogs\nwhich have been physically bred to be conventionally owned at the expense of\ntheir ability to pursue what they find meaningful? Purebred dogs are\nnotoriously prone to health problems, especially many of the show dogs and\ncute breeds people buy for their appearance. For instance:\n\n> \u201cA bulldog\u2019s cute flat face is an example of a genetic manipulation that can\n> lead to a whole lot of problems for these little guys. Some hereditary and\n> congenital diseases associated with bulldogs are an elongated soft palate,\n> hip dysplasia, an internalized tail, irregular tear duct production,\n> dislocated shoulder joints, collapsed nostrils, and Cherry Eye, an eyelid\n> abnormality.\u201d\n\nNote that bull dogs used to literally fight bulls.\n\nSo maybe all these adorable beagles, dachshunds, bull dogs, etc. which seem\ncontent to sit in an owner\u2019s lap and wheeze until they drop dead at eight-\nyears-old are actually completely miserable because their genetically-\ndetermined instinct to hunt polar bears has been hindered by chronic health\nproblems inculcated by aesthetic-oriented inbreeding. Or maybe not. I don\u2019t\nknow.\n\nOr maybe all these dogs really are happy being lap dogs. In which case...\nthat\u2019s ok, I guess. It just means that humanity took the proud common ancestor\nof the mighty wolf and turned it into a deformed, disease-ridden, inbred pug.\n\nSo on the whole, I think most dogs probably have miserable lives. Despite\nhaving their daily needs met, many are under-stimulated, and most probably\nlack meaningful pursuits. But dogs are only one side of the dog ownership\nequation. What about the owners?\n\nWhat is the Appeal of Owning a Dog?\n\nThis is going to sound weird, but I think of dog owners kind of the same way I\nthink of people who have sex with furniture. Even if there isn\u2019t something\nwrong with the act itself, being into the act indicates something very wrong\nwith the actor.\n\nBasically, dog owners seem to enjoy indulging in a feeling of unearned\ndominance over another being. They like the idea of having a fairly\nemotionally sophisticated animal being completely dependent upon them. And\nthey especially enjoy the Stockholm Syndrome-esque sense of loyalty the animal\ndevelops to the entity upon which its continued survival entirely depends.\n\nDom vs. Sub\n\nI have a friend who has always seen dog ownership as akin to slavery. It\u2019s not\nthat dogs are forced to work, or that they have sufficient cognitive capacity\nto necessarily suffer in captivity, rather, it\u2019s the sheer patheticness of\ntheir existence. A standard household dog embodies groveling submissiveness in\na way that no other animal does, to the point where dogs are the literal\nsymbol of submission for humans.\n\nNearly all pets are kept in enclosures where they survive on the food and\nwater granted by masters, but at least they mostly do what they want\nthroughout their days. Hamsters run on wheels, gerbils chew cardboard, lizards\nbathe under heat lamps, etc. As mentioned, my childhood cat roamed the\noutdoors during the days and napped all over the house at night. Moo was owned\nbut he also had about as much of his own life as a pet could possibly have.\n\nBut dogs don\u2019t have lives beyond their owners. They don\u2019t really play with\ntoys on their own. All the things they enjoy (treats, fetch, walking, etc.)\nare done with or at the behest of their owners. As a result, dogs are utterly\npsychologically dependent upon their owners. Whether a dog has a fun during an\nafternoon depends on whether the owner takes him to the park, so the dog will\nnaturally do everything it can to endear itself to the owner by jumping on his\nlegs, rubbing up against him, licking his hand, whining, etc. The dog may not\nunderstand that it is trying to emotionally manipulate the owner via its\ncuteness and debasement, but it is, at least via instinct.\n\nAnd again, for the owner this is a feature, not a bug. The dog\u2019s desperate\npandering to elicit sympathy so he might be let out of the apartment and go to\nthe park for a game of catch is considered adorable and funny. The owner\nenjoys when the dog debases itself.\n\nEven farm animals are not expected or encouraged to engage in this indignity.\nCows and pigs don\u2019t really do anything but eat, sleep, and wait to be\nslaughtered, but that\u2019s all they do. They haven\u2019t been bred to suck up to\ntheir masters and beg for attention or stimulation. Dogs are the only animals\nwho have been genetically and behaviorally conditioned to maximize\ninterpersonal submissiveness for our benefit.\n\nWhat does it say about a human who enjoys this emotional transaction? It says\nthat on some level they like the idea of having dominance over another being.\nAnd, they want that dominance to be a feature of their daily life.\n\nI don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with enjoying dominance, per se. Sexual\ndominance is clearly a popular tendency, and likewise, the desire to dominate\nothers in competitions is a useful inborn characteristic which incentivizes\nambitiousness and effort. I think identifying and pursuing both of those forms\nof dominance can bring pleasure and satisfaction in a healthy way.\n\nBut the dominance one gains over an owned dog is more akin to the dominance an\nabusive spouse has over a partner. It\u2019s a perpetual dominance built on the\nrecognition and furtherance of intrinsic strength differences. Sexual\ndominance is sort of a simulation of this arrangement meant for temporarily\nindulging in the thrill of power. Competitive domination is temporarily\nderived from an earned display of competence and victory. But dog owner\ndominance consists of constantly having and using power over a weaker, dumber,\nutterly dependent creature for your benefit. Teaching the dog \u201ctricks\u201d like\nsitting and rolling over are expressions of the dog\u2019s submissiveness which\ngarner a thrill for the owner. The dog\u2019s whining as it sits by the dining room\ntable and begs for food can be heartbreaking but is likewise a reinforcement\nof its permanent underclass status within the hierarchy of its life.\n\nIn this sense, I agree with my friend that dog ownership resembles slavery.\nNot the dispassionate slavery of sending workmen to die in the mines, but the\npersonal slavery of having a being in one\u2019s house who suffers moment-by-moment\nindignities for the sake of the master\u2019s minor pleasures and long-term\nassurance of his vaunted status.\n\nEarned vs. Unearned\n\nThe unearned nature of the owner-dog relationship is especially disturbing. I\nbelieve every rational relationship must be earned by mutual value production\nand the virtues which produce said value. You earn your friends by being\nfunny, insightful, interesting, reliable, etc. You earn your romantic partner\nby being attractive, passionate, supportive, inspiring, etc. Every\nrelationship should be earned. Relationships which aren\u2019t earned feel hollow,\none-sided, and potentially exploitative. Earning a relationship by one\u2019s\nvirtues grants a sense of accomplishment and general value which enriches the\nlives of all involved and serves as a valid pillar of self-esteem.\n\nHow do dog owners earn the loyalty of their dogs? They feed them, walk them,\nhopefully play with them, and don\u2019t abuse them. Basically, they keep the dog\nalive. This is not difficult. People have been doing it for tens of thousands\nof years.\n\nIn return, dog owners receive a severity and depth of affection beyond any\nthey could ever receive from another human being, unless they\u2019re rock stars or\nsomething. Dog owners are granted an undying subservience and loyalty from a\nconscious being. They will be adored and basically worshiped by an adorable\ncreature until the day it dies.\n\nWhat\u2019s most seductive about this exchange is the visceral nature of the dog\u2019s\naffection. As far as I can tell, there is no animal which can come remotely\nclose to the emotional expressiveness of dogs (besides humans). I\u2019m terrible\nat understanding dog emotions, but even I can see the elated mania in the\ncockapoo\u2019s eyes when she sees her owner. As Robert De Niro notes in Meet the\nParents, some people must find that greeting to be a sort of \u201cassurance\u201d of\ntheir worth. They bask in the glow of a being which loves them\nunconditionally. But I found the devotion unnerving precisely because I didn\u2019t\nfeel it was earned by any recognizable moral calculus.\n\nFrom the dog\u2019s perspective, being kept alive may seem like a reasonable grant\nof value. But keep in mind that the dog has no choice in the matter. A dog\ncan\u2019t decide he doesn\u2019t like his owner and switch to a new one, and assuming\nthe owner isn\u2019t incompetent, the dog can\u2019t just run away. The dog is simply\nforced into a situation where his life is saved by the owner every day.\nPresumably by sheer evolutionary development, dogs have been bred to return\ninsane loyalty and enthusiasm to their captors in exchange for living. It\u2019s\nlike a species has been completely conquered by Nietzsche\u2019s slave morality.\n\nAgain, even if you put aside the happiness of the dog and the value it gets\nfrom being owned, I find the owner\u2019s emotional inclination worrying. The owner\nwants to experience the visceral emotional sensation of being loved and\nneeded, but doesn\u2019t want to work hard for it like he would have to with\nhumans. He\u2019d prefer to take the short cut and get it from a dumb animal. I\nmanaged to get it from a depressed cockapoo after keeping her alive for three\ndays.\n\nOr another way to put it...\n\nPorn is to Sex as Dogs Are to Babies\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to nurture and protect something. We have\na strong inborn instinct for these tendencies, as it primes us for the crucial\nduties of parenthood. Thus the mother-child bond is probably the single-\ndeepest emotional connection that humans can form.\n\nBut just as porn is a cheap, easy, unfulfilling version of sex with another\nhuman being, dogs are a cheap, easy, unfulfilling version of raising a baby.\nI\u2019m pretty sure that a significant number of dog owners choose to engage in\nthe activity because they want to experience the nurturing process of child-\nraising and the reciprocated affection of the baby, but without having to go\nthrough the arduous process of actually making and raising a real human. There\neven seems to be a trend of millennials choosing to own dogs instead of having\nkids.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I took the cockapoo to the park to meet up with my friend and\nhis three-year-old son that it struck me just how baby-like dogs are. They are\nboth largely helpless, dumb, moody creatures with an extremely limited range\nof potential activity which precludes them from self-sufficiency. Since, like\nbabies, dogs are entirely dependent upon adult humans for survival, dogs have\nliterally evolutionarily optimized to inspire affection and care from humans.\nTheir facial muscles have actually morphed to retain puppy-like features to\nstay cute for humans. Through 40 generations of selective breeding, wild foxes\nwere turned into subservient wimps who instinctively curried favor from humans\nfor sustenance.\n\nBut why is raising a dog somehow worse than raising a baby?\n\nIn my view, the great moral foundation of parenting is that adults are working\nto raise a dependent, immature being into an independent, mature one. A\nmother\u2019s instinct to feed and protect a child serves it well when it\u2019s weak\nand helpless, but it\u2019s all in the service of keeping the child alive until it\nhas the strength and capability to defend and maintain itself.\n\nDog ownership carries over the protection and care of a weak, helpless being,\nbut with no terminal goal. At least within a modern context, a puppy and then\ndog will never mature into a self-sufficient animal. Yet again, this is not a\nbug of dog ownership, but a feature. Owners want a being that never grows up,\nmuch like the evil Santa Claus in the criminally underrated tv show, Happy!\n\nThus, dog ownership is based on a perversion of parental instincts. The\nimpetus to protect and maintain a helpless creature becomes the driving and\nterminal goal, rather than the transformation of the creature. The owner must\nenjoy the helplessness of its ward. The pet\u2019s pathetic inability to get its\nown food and water is reframed as a virtue of the relationship, rather than a\ndetractor. The same could be said of the dog\u2019s omnipresent helplessness, from\nthe boredom it feels when left alone, to its conditioned inability to shit\nunless taken outside.\n\nConsider a mother who wished for her child to never grow up. She never wants\nto see the baby become a teenager, develop his own interests, find his skills,\nface failure, make friends, have sex, develop romantic relationships, etc. She\njust wants it to grow from an infant to a three-year-old and then stay stuck\nin that form for about seven more years until it dies. The child will always\nbe by its mother\u2019s side, never able to feed or protect itself, and by\nextension, be completely emotionally dependent upon her too. The child may\noccasionally see other children, but the center of his life will always be his\nmother\u2019s embrace.\n\nThat\u2019s basically what dog ownership is. The animal starts as an extremely\nhelpless puppy, grows into a helpless dog, stays helpless as it ages, and then\ndies in a short-by-human-standards time frame.\n\nEternal Innocence\n\nLikewise, the animal\u2019s supposed innocence seems to be a focal point for many\ndog owners. We see this with the \u201cwe don\u2019t deserve dogs\u201d meme. There\u2019s this\nidea that dogs are good, pure, wonderful beings because they display mindless\nloyalty to their owners. Even dogs which do ostensibly bad things only do so\nout of malicious training on the part of their human owners, ie. fighting\ndogs.\n\nOnce again, I think this is a product of the dog\u2019s unique combination of high\nemotional sophistication (for an animal) and low intelligence (for a human). A\ndog is emotionally sophisticated enough to do things that mimic moral decision\nmaking without actually doing moral decision making. Or more charitably, dogs\ncan perform a very primitive form of moral decision-making that is mistaken\nfor sophisticated decision-making.\n\nConsider this: a dog goes outside and grabs random objects to present to his\nowner when she\u2019s feeling sad. The owner feels gracious towards the dog for\nrecognizing her sadness and attempting to console her even though the method\nby which the dog does so is meaningless.\n\nI think what\u2019s happening here is that the owner is implicitly personifying the\ndog and giving it the moral credit a human would receive in its position.\nMeaning, the woman would feel gracious toward a human friend who brought her\nunsolicited gifts when she was feeling sad.\n\nHowever, the main reason we would give a human moral credit in that situation\nis because the human has the cognitive capacity to map an enormous range of\npotential actions and he chooses to pick this one. The human could have stayed\nhome and played video games, or hung out with other friends, or did his taxes,\netc., but instead he took time out of his day to make a friend feel better. In\nother words, the opportunity cost of the action undergirds its value.\n\nBut the opportunity cost consideration doesn\u2019t (as far as I know) impact a\ndog. The dog did not have the cognitive capacity to wonder whether it should\ndig holes outside or console his owner, he just acted on instinct. And even if\nthe dog somehow did have sufficient cognitive capacity to make such\ncalculations, its status as an owned pet greatly restricts the potential\nalternative actions anyway, especially given the Stockholm Syndrome it is\nlikely suffering.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s not nice and fun for that cute dog to do what it did.\nI\u2019m saying that we should be aware that the dog\u2019s actions are a pale\nsimulacrum of what human beings do.\n\nThis is why dogs are like porn. They approximate a deep, meaningful\nexperience, but come up short on its essentials. They\u2019re a cheap substitute\nfor a real relationship which can be bought with treats and the bare minimum\nof responsibility.\n\nI\u2019m guessing many people\u2019s response to all this is: \u201cOf course dogs aren\u2019t\nhumans, I don\u2019t think of them on those terms. I don\u2019t get some sort of sick\ndominance thrill from owning a dog, nor do I use them as a weak substitute for\nhuman companionship. I just appreciate dogs for the cute, happy, excitable\nanimals they are.\u201d\n\nToo which I respond... if you stare long enough into the abyss, it stares back\nat you.\n\nI think few dog owners seek these sorts of emotional experiences, but they\nprobably experience them anyway. I don\u2019t see how they can\u2019t while living with\na dog. The dominance over a perpetually helpless being which returns worship\nfor survival is integral to the dog owning process. Engaging in that behavior\nis bound to reveal psychological traits or even cause them inadvertently, in\nthe same way that being in the military or working as a prison guard will\nundoubtedly change the way you see your fellow man in some sense.\n\nDog Racket\n\nIf you were a sociopathic businessman trying to create an industry to exploit\npeople\u2019s emotions for money, you could not possibly design a more perfect\nracket than dog ownership.\n\nDogs are \u201cman\u2019s best friend.\u201d They have an ancient history of bonding with\nhumans. As stated, dogs are literally evolutionarily optimized to mimic\nchildren to induce maximum sympathy and moral concern from adult humans. For\nhumans, there is nothing more worthy of love and affection than dogs, besides\nfamily members. More than 40% of women and 25% of men would let a stranger\nburn to death to save their own dog.\n\nWith \u201cfur babies\u201d becoming so much more beloved and pampered in the modern\nage, whole new industries have been popped up to let owners show how much they\nlove their dogs, like dog clothes, dog cameras, dog strollers, dog spas, dog\ndentistry, dog treadmills, dog umbrellas, dog butt covers, dog purses, dog\nchairs, dog cologne, dog nail polish, and dog beer.\n\nYet dogs typically only live for about a decade. That\u2019s more than enough time\nfor a human to get attached to one, and then to feel a giant dog-shaped hole\nin his heart when the animal dies, thus ensuring more dog purchases in the\nfuture. It\u2019s also a perfect amount of time for a dog to be a beloved companion\nfor a child throughout his youth, thereby ensuring a life-long addiction to\ndogs.\n\nBefore the dog\u2019s short life expires, it will inevitably fall victim to a\nmassive array of health problems which require expensive medical examinations,\ndrugs, or surgeries to treat. Just as with human healthcare, the marginal\nbenefits of these treatments will decline over time, while their costs will\nincrease. But don\u2019t worry, you can buy $500-600 per year dog health insurance\nif you want. And you\u2019d better, because an unwillingness to expend resources to\nkeep the dog alive for as long as possible will be met by admonishment from\nother dog owners who believe there is no limit to what dogs deserve.\n\nAlso, if like many dog owners you\u2019d want to get one of those adorable brand\nname dog breeds you\u2019ve loved since childhood rather than a random mutt, your\ndog will be more expensive, less healthy, and rack up especially high medical\nbills as its inborn health problems mount with age. In other words, much like\nflashy sports cars, the most popular and expensive dog models have de facto\nplanned obsolescence.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that the dog industry is some sort of evil cabal... but it has\npretty much turned out like that anyway.\n\nIf All of the Above is True, does that Mean Dog Ownership is Wrong?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think it necessarily is. But I think we should be highly\nconscientious of what dog ownership indicates about the owner, and how\nownership impacts both the owner and the dog.\n\nAs someone who has never owned a dog, I\u2019ve come up with a few principles for\nguiding dog ownership:\n\n  * The goal of a dog owner should be to simulate the meaning inherent in purposeful dog life while protecting the dog from the downsides of wild living. This means giving the dog a job or some sort of purpose while protecting its health and physical safety.\n  * Dog owners should be highly conscientious of why they\u2019re getting a dog. They should explicitly know what emotional and psychological benefits they are getting from ownership. They should ask themselves if such benefits are truly healthy for themselves and the dog.\n  * Giving a dog a purpose not only makes the dog happier, but makes its relationship with the owner more of an exchange rather than a dom-sub relationship. This is psychologically healthier for the owner and probably for the dog too.\n  * Somewhere between many and most dog breeds should only be owned in ideal settings \u2013 farms, ranches, wilderness, etc. Owning the dogs outside of these circumstances is likely cruel.\n  * Most dog owners should buy small-to-mid sized breeds with a long genetic history of high sociability and little-to-no history of work. Such dogs are the most well-suited to modern ownership. Cockapoos are actually a really good choice by these standards.\n  * Unless you have a really good reason to get a thoroughbred, you should probably rescue a mutt from a dog shelter instead. Mutts are healthier, don\u2019t contribute to the continued genetic deformity of purebreds, and can be rescued from misery and/or death in shelters.\n  * Unless you have the resources to pay for a doggy-day-care where the dog spends all days with other dogs, you probably shouldn\u2019t own a dog if you have a full time job.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nPeep Show \u2013 The Most Realistic Portrayal of Evil Ever MadeJanuary 22, 2020In\n\"Fiction Analysis\"\n\nExamining 1999\u2019s Culture Through Its Best MoviesJanuary 22, 2020In\n\"Miscellaneous\"\n\nNotes On The BalkansJuly 17, 2022In \"Miscellaneous\"\n\nCategories Miscellaneous\u2022Tags border collies, bull dogs, cats, chihuahuas,\ncockapoo, dogs, golden retreivers, hamsters, hounds, labrador retrievers, Meet\nthe Parents, Moo, Nietzsche, pit bulls, pugs, Reddit, saint bernards, shih\ntzus, The Office, we don't deserve dogs\n\n## 41 thoughts on \u201cAgainst Dog Ownership\u201d\n\n  1.

Rebecca S says:\n\nMarch 23, 2020 at 3:36 am\n\nYou\u2019re ignoring things from an evolutionary perspective, I\u2019d say. Most studies\nI\u2019ve read seem to suggest that dogs and humans co-evolved and share a\nsymbiotic relationship. Dogs didn\u2019t just come around for scraps and then\nbecome \u201ckidnapped\u201d by humans. Dogs differed from wolves in that they were\nscavengers, and they chose to linger around human camps willingly for any\nscraps they could find. The wolves that evolved into dogs were already\ndifferent from other wolves in that they preferred to svanage rather than\nhunt. Most dogs are content to sit by a warm fire, chew bones, have snuggles,\nand play with toys (at least they those dogs who weren\u2019t specifically bred to\nbe working breeds). Dogs are one of the most evolutionarily successful\ncreatures on the planet. They use our brain power to guarantee a supply of\nfood, and for years we used their protection and hunting and hearing\ncapabilities, and later herding, and now we have service dogs and\ncompanionship. Dogs release 5 times more oxytocin than cats when they look at\ntheir people. They love their people, and their people similarly release\noxytocin when they look at their pooches. You\u2019ve evidently spent time with an\nanxious pup with separation anxiety who came to trust you and derive comfort\nfrom your presence. There\u2019s nothing subservient about it. They decided they\nliked you enough to derive comfort from your presence. If they didn\u2019t like\nyou, they probably would have just kept sleeping and only came around for\nfood. Not all dogs have separation anxiety and some are more independent than\nothers. It\u2019s hard for me as a dog owner to see my dog whose life is full love,\ntrips to the beach, swimming, running, playing, camping, hanging out with my\nother family member\u2019s dogs, etc., and think they somehow have a bad life.\nSeeing their eyes light up when family comes over for celebrations etc., you\nreally feel like they are part of the family. Of course, not everyone feels\nthat way and that\u2019s fine. One thing I do agree with you is that high-energy\nworking dogs should be on farms and in environments where they can use their\nskills. It would be nice if more people considered that before getting a dog.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n    1. Matt Lakeman says:\n\nMarch 23, 2020 at 9:55 am\n\nI agree that the evolutionary angle is key; dogs co-evolved with humans far\nmore than any other species. But I\u2019m not sure how well modern life for dogs\nreflects the environments unless we evolved together. I fear that drift has\nleft them with less \u201cmeaning\u201d and more \u201csubservience\u201d in its place.

But people have the freedom to evade this trap. There\u2019s nothing\nstopping the average American from trading income for free time, during which\nthey can pursue their passions and whatever they want. I suspect most people\nfavor income due to social pressure rather than any sort of existential need.\n\nIn other words: the average college-educated American could move to a low-cost\nrural area, get a stress-free job working 25 hours per week, accept a smaller\nliving space and fewer luxuries, but have vastly more free time every week to\ndo whatever he wants.\n\nThe fact that most people don\u2019t do that either indicates revealed preference\nor some sort of market failure. Either way, the option is there.\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\n  6. Ben says:\n\nMarch 23, 2020 at 8:33 pm\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how much I agree with your article.

The things you just mentioned could very well\nbe meaningful to people. It\u2019s not your place nor does it make any sense to\ndecree other people\u2019s meaning. Let me guess, you only say they aren\u2019t\nmeaningful because those people aren\u2019t working on some ambitious project for\nthe betterment of all humanity? Man, what a high bar. I guess you think most\npeople\u2019s lives are totally meaningless. How condescending.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n    1.

It doesn\u2019t take much to give them\nsomething better than what they would have in a shelter or on the street.\n\nAlso your response to the commenter\u2019s point about babies vs dogs is totally\ninadequate.

It\u2019s a bit irresponsible to take\nsome of the wild leaps and generalizations you\u2019ve taken about both dog and dog\nowners. You\u2019ve also omitted all and any scientific and historical research\naround the co-evolution and anthropological history of dogs and humans, which\nis seen as a symbiotic relationship as well as psychology of dogs. Notably\nabsent is any data indicating that your musings may be incorrect.\n\nYou\u2019ve brought up some good points of consideration for someone who may want\nto be a dog owner \u2013 how much time, energy, space, etc., do they have to meet\nthe dog\u2019s needs, intellectual ability and desires, what is the reason they are\nseeking out dog ownership, etc. \u2013 but have clouded these thoughtful questions\nwith a lot of questionable logic and at times, blatantly untrue or\ncontradictory statements.\n\nThere\u2019s also a separate question of interest and ethics to be asked here:\nyou\u2019ve treated your family\u2019s ownership of the cat, Moo, as a model of ethical\nand proper pet ownership. However, cats left free to roam outside contribute\nto the endangerment and extinction of bird species throughout North America\nand much of the developed world. Additionally, this style of pet ownership can\nprovide hassle to other neighborhood pets and residence. You made similar\ncomments in reference to neutering and spaying, which research indicates\ngreatly reduces the risk of rabies, overpopulation and many other issues in\ncommunities. Having an indoor/outdoor animal that is not neutered or spayed is\ngenerally considered unethical. Your comments about Moo and feline ownership\nin comparison to dog ownership come across as misguided, jaded and with an\nulterior motive since you never address the dubious ethicality of your own pet\nownership.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n    1. Bean Sprugget says:\n\nAugust 2, 2021 at 1:10 am\n\nYou say that his family\u2019s treatment of Moo is \u201cactually unethical\u201d. It is\npossible that this treatment is good for Moo, even if it is bad for other\nanimals. It would be as if we were to leash children or people in general\nbecause they might harm other people. (Of course, the danger they pose to\nbirds might be worth the restricted freedom.) The same goes for neutering and\nspaying; neutering/spaying humans would greatly reduce STD rates and reduce\noverpopulation, but obviously we don\u2019t want that.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n  13.

Anonymous says:\n\nJune 4, 2021 at 1:31 pm\n\nNot done with this, but having gotten up to the bit about the human psychology\nof dog ownership, I think you have some basic misconceptions. Dogs are pack\nanimals; they have a natural need for not only companionship, but hierarchy.\nIt is the dog owners who, consciously or not, aim at dominance who are the\ngood ones, because they will properly fill a space in a dog\u2019s relationship\nmodels and give it the opportunity to likewise fit in. If you look at the\nbehavior of a younger and inadequately trained dog with a new person, they may\nbe testing out the hierarchy and finding out: can I boss you around? Am I\nabove you? The answer is always no, but the dog won\u2019t experience this as\nthwarted ambition, it just has to know. This then goes back to the discussion\nof meaning in a dog\u2019s life. You\u2019ve allowed for the fact that they are mentally\nsimpler, but not that they are also fundamentally pretty different. There are\ntons of understimulated dogs with terrible owners, but it\u2019s not nobler as a\ndog owner to acknowledge your shortcomings and try to go for a more\ncollaborative approach; you dominate and train the dog because then its social\nneeds are being met properly. It\u2019s just a practical matter that the dog\ndoesn\u2019t get to be pack leader, it\u2019s living in a human society with a human, so\nat some point it will become clear that the human has to lead. That said, yes,\ncollies should not live in apartments; but generally the manifestation of\ninadequate stimulation or meaning for a dog is precisely issues with obedience\nand training, these are not the sick projections of the human owner.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Humanizing dogs and then trying to act like feeling\nsorry for their condition is pointless other than being an exercise of moral\nsuperiority. Not encouraging ownership, somebody just doesn\u2019t get along or\nlives a life that\u2019s compatible with having a pet, but some overly\nsophisticated arguments, like the cited reddit post e.g., just miss the whole\npoint and shows a total lack of comprehension about dog\u2019s ethology.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n    2.

People enjoy being around others they feel emotionally close to\n(which happens easier for some than others).\n\nI mean, in a way, this whole article is basically you feeling superior to huge\nswaths of the population over some ridiculously mundane behavior.

You see this as somehow fake, that the REAL\ngoal/purpose/value of bringing up a child is that it produces an adult human\nat the end. Again, I get the point, but I think that\u2019s an incorrect way of\nlooking at things. Suppose that you are the parent of a child that\u2019s autistic\nor has Downs or is otherwise mentally retarded. While it is undoubtedly\nfrustrating, even depressing, to have to care for that human as a child for\nthe rest of your life, I don\u2019t think most such parents would consider it in\nsome sense pointless because there is no adult human as the endpoint.\n\nThere is a larger point here that I want to concentrate on (and if you find it\ninteresting, perhaps you might want to write your own successor essay). I\n*think* that one of the ways our times (meaning say post-2000, with weaker\nversions of the claim going back 50, then 100, then 200 years) is that we no\nlonger say \u201cI dislike X\u201d, we say \u201cI dislike X because...\u201d. These may seem the\nsame, but they are very much not! The former statement has no power, it\u2019s\nsimply an assertion of opinion or preference. But the second statement gives\nyou control, it gives you superiority, it gives you deference.\n\nWith the use of the word \u201cbecause\u201d I think we are seeing something like the\ninvention of lying, a social technology that works on people almost magically,\nwithout much self-defense. You think I exaggerate?\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201310/the-power-the-word-\nbecause-get-people-do-stuff\n\nWhereas in the past one might have said \u201cI find something about dog ownership\ndepressing/icky/unpleasant\u201d (fair enough, I pretty much agree) in modern times\nwe say \u201cDog ownership is wrong because...\u201d and once because is in there, we\nare forced to make up theories and justifications. These don\u2019t have to be (and\nusually are not...) good theories and justifications, they simply have to be\nwords that aren\u2019t clearly (very extremely clearly! \u201cI have to make copies\nbecause I have to make copies\u201d!!) nonsense.\n\nNow dog ownership is not a pressing concern of our time. (Though who knows,\nmaybe it will form the basis of the culture wars of 2122? Would anyone in 1922\nhave seriously thought that the political faultlines of 2022 would revolve\naround who gets to call themself a woman or a man?) However what is a huge\nproblem in our time is people unwilling to simply say \u201cI find X icky\u201d (where X\ncan be anything: old men with younger women? calling 16-yr old women girls?\nbehavior by a particular rich person towards a particular non-rich person?)\nRather this becomes a \u201cbecause\u201d claim, at which point it takes on a life of\nits own. And thus we get to 2022 where public political life has lost its mind\nbecause of an incoherent web of mutually contradictory statements, everyone of\nwhich we are supposed to believe and affirm (as the justification for some\n\u201cbecause\u201d.) We\u2019re supposed to believe that there is no mental difference\nbetween men and women AND that it\u2019s precisely because men and women have\ndifferent minds that some ostensibly male humans might identify as female.\nWe\u2019re supposed to believe that who owned land many years ago determines moral\nworth (US, Australia) AND that who owned land many years ago has no relevance\nto moral worth (Crimea, Israel). We\u2019re supposed to believe that any difference\nin the number of categories of people in any particular occupation is ipso\nfacto evidence of racism \u2013 except in sports...\n\nYou and I clearly can\u2019t fix the mania of our times. But what we can do is try\nto track and check our own behavior. Try to be careful about when we use the\nword \u201cbecause\u201d and try to limit it to cases where we\u2019re actually laying out\nsome sort of logical argument, not merely trying to win allies to an opinion.\nThat\u2019s probably a little strong, but I think we are not yet aware of the harm\nthat is being done by spurious claims of \u201cX because Y\u201d.\n\n(And yes, I am WELL aware of how the above applies exactly to the argument I\nhave been making! What can I say? Read my points and make up your own mind.\nJust try to remember, every time you use \u201cbecause\u201d, would this fit Kant\u2019s\ncategorical imperative? Can I find an example that goes against my tribal\nloyalties for which my \u201cbecause\u201d argument also works? If so, then the argument\nis surely a tribal argument, not the universal logic I am trying to claim it\nto be.)\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n  20.

Ignore everything\nelse in this article and everything that can be construed as opinion. Here is\nthe physical reality of dogs owned by humans as pets: \u2013 Dogs are only created\nby two dogs breeding. \u2013 Dogs are taken from their natural nurturing parents\nand have their genitals removed shortly after birth. \u2013 A population of dogs\nwith no genitals cannot breed, so there is only one path to life. \u2013 Dogs have\nno ability to eat, drink, or defecate in the environment they are forced to\nlive in after being taken from their parents and ritually made sterile. \u2013 Dogs\ndo not unconditionally love humans, it\u2019s survival instinct and is entirely\nconditional. The conditions are to love their owner in order to receive the\nthings they need to survive. People do not keep or continue to offer food,\nwater, shelter and affection to dogs that do not return love and affection. \u2013\nDogs that do not exhibit affection to its owners are given to shelters or are\n\u201crehomed.\u201d This pattern repeats until the dog either complies with expected\nbehavior, is abandoned, or is killed.\n\nI\u2019m not saying dog ownership is wrong.
