Among vertebrates,\nfish were the first to do it, going back some 400 million years. While it\nmight be fun for fish and all the other species that evolved to reproduce\nsexually, for most species, sex still is just sex. But for our own peculiar\nspecies of primate, sex is about something more. Sex is about babymaking.\nContemplating sex and where we come from has played a fundamental role in\nhuman mating, partnering and raising children, and in forming families,\ncommunities and alliances, and more. Recognising this fundamental difference\nbetween us and the rest of Earth\u2019s sexual beings overturns conventional\nevolutionary thinking, which has long understood human sex, reproduction and\nkinship as fundamentally the same for us as for any other mammal.\n\nAll sexually reproducing animals have a powerful \u2018sex drive\u2019. If they didn\u2019t,\nthey would quickly become extinct. Among most animals, this drive demands\nimmediate attention. It\u2019s the yowls of the tomcats in the alley who detect a\nfemale in heat, the bawling bull who smells a receptive cow. It can\u2019t be\nignored. But it\u2019s not a \u2018baby drive\u2019 \u2013 at least it isn\u2019t experienced as one.\nWe know the two are intimately related, but the tomcat doesn\u2019t. He just wants\nto find that female in heat. Sex can certainly make for high drama among\nmanipulative social mammals, especially primates. Among many monkeys and apes,\nthe alpha male often sires the most offspring during his tenure because he is\ngranted the least fettered access to fertile females, and can foil the sexual\ndevices of subordinates. But with our inventions of virgin worship, marriage,\ncastration, contraception, fertility technology and genetic engineering, the\nhuman primate experiences sex in an entirely different way from any other\nanimal, enmeshed in all kinds of cultural and emotional networks and\nsignificance.\n\nStories about what make humans unique glorify dexterous fingers, inventive\nminds and our habit of sharing complex ideas through intricate verbal cues.\nOur ancestors\u2019 fabled intellects gave rise to art, technology and dynamic,\nlarge-scale politics. But there is an oft-overlooked plot in the human saga.\nIt stars the ancient hominins who realised that they\u2019re related to some people\nand not others, and that sexual intercourse might have something to do with\nthat. The effects of this realisation are profound, and deserve some credit\nfor our species\u2019 widespread success on the planet.\n\nPop culture is obsessed with sex, and science is no different. And for good\nreason: sex is fundamental to how and whether so much animal evolution\nhappens. In conventional evolutionary science, \u2018favoured\u2019 genes cause\nthemselves to be passed from one generation to the next, because they are\nresponsible for traits that confer reproductive advantages in a particular\nenvironment. This is natural selection. When it comes to sex and reproduction,\nscience takes a particular interest in sexual selection: that is, the\nevolution of traits involving mate choice and mating behaviours. Within this\nframe, scientists have tried to trace the origins of human mating, marriage\nand kinship to evolutionary \u2018strategies\u2019 that, conscious or not, were\nresponsible for our survival and continued evolution rather than our\nextinction.\n\nIn other words, if you follow this mainstream or \u2018Darwinian\u2019 logic, there must\nbe genes that underpin mating behaviours, which in turn cause animals\n(including the human animal) to be successful in reproducing, and thus those\ngenes (and their associated behaviours) are perpetuated in populations. If\nthat\u2019s how simply things actually happen in nature, there will be genes \u2018for\u2019\nmate preference, genes \u2018for\u2019 pair-bonding, genes \u2018for\u2019 polygamy and so on.\n\nWe share many genes even with fruit flies, but we share far more with non-\nhuman primates. We share an especially large proportion of our genome with our\nclosest relatives \u2013 chimpanzees and bonobos \u2013 so, if their mating behaviour is\ngenetically driven, then we\u2019ll learn a lot about ourselves by studying these\napes. Although no one has actually identified genes for infanticide or for\navoiding incest, for most evolutionary scientists, answers to questions such\nas why is infanticide so common among chimps and some monkeys, or why is the\nincest taboo so common in human societies, ought to be applicable\ninterchangeably to all of us primates. Thus, evolutionary psychology and\nevolutionary theory more broadly has a clear theoretical box for human\nsexuality: the model of animal mating.\n\nBack in 1997, the psychologist Steven Pinker wrote in How the Mind Works: \u2018The\nhuman mating system is not like any other animal\u2019s. But that does not mean it\nescapes the laws governing mating systems, which have been documented in\nhundreds of species.\u2019 In Mutants (2004), the evolutionary developmental\nbiologist Armand Leroi summed up this hardline argument with: \u2018the\npsychologies of pheasants and Fijians are really much the same\u2019. The idea\nhere, the \u2018law\u2019 that governs mating, is that sexual selection is assumed to\ndrive reproductive behaviour in similar ways in all kinds of creatures.\nConventional theory describes the characteristics we use to choose our mates,\nbe it the resplendent tail of the peacock or a man\u2019s full beard, as indicators\nof good genes, that is, genetic predisposition for strength or good health,\nand thus we\u2019re choosing not just a full beard, but a collection of favourable\ngenes to pass on to our children. This strips away any uniqueness in our\nreproductive behaviour; we\u2019re just like any other animal.There have been many\nhuman mating behaviours that have been anointed by hyper-Darwinians as\n\u2018natural\u2019 to the species, often by analogy with other primates \u2013 and often\nrevealing as much about the preconceptions of their inventors as about any\nsound science. Thus we are told that men are genetically programmed to be\ndominant, women are programmed to seek the alpha male, monogamy is innate for\nwomen, polygamy is innate for men, and many other examples. Male violence is\nregularly interpreted as a programmatic legacy from human evolution, and\nviolent stepfathers who hurt their partners\u2019 children are understood to be\nacting out of the same impulses as male chimpanzees who kill infants in a\ntroop. Thus the standard trope of \u2018Demonic Males\u2019 and choosy females.\n\nThese potent images are worth unpacking because they reveal the disorienting\nfeedback loops between seeing ourselves as just like other animals, while\ninterpreting other animals as being just like us.\n\nAccording to conventional evolutionary theory, dominant male chimps and some\nother primates kill infants in the troops they join because they know that\nthese babies aren\u2019t theirs. This makes sense to mainstream evolutionary theory\nbecause every organism\u2019s purpose in life is to survive to reproduce, but even\nbetter is when my genes outcompete yours. I win, you lose. Thus, a dominant\nmale kills unrelated infants because this increases the chances that his\ngenes, inside his babies, will outcompete, or outnumber, his rivals\u2019. Survival\nof the fittest, indeed.\n\nIn eliminating the distinctions between human sexual behaviour and that of\nother primates, a murky anthropomorphism creeps in. The journalist Nicholas\nWade wrote in The New York Times that male chimps and baboons \u2018are prone to\nkill any infant they believe could not be theirs, so females try to blur\npaternity by mating with as many individuals as possible before each\nconception\u2019. This suggests that non-human primates could know that semen\ntransforms into a baby and that the act of sex, broadly, makes an infant.\nFurther, it implies that they have a sense of relatedness, and that it extends\nto fathers. If not, then it\u2019s deliberately narrating animal sex and violence\nlike a scene from Game of Thrones, for our entertainment. And it works (it\u2019s\nsensational and relatable) because a more scientifically grounded alternative\n\u2013 male baboons, gorillas and chimps might kill infants, but they\u2019re less\nlikely to kill ones clinging to females with whom they\u2019ve mated because sexual\nrelations between primates builds affiliation \u2013 isn\u2019t nearly as scintillating.\n\nIt\u2019s not just journalism that falls into this trap: scientists aren\u2019t all that\ndeft at escaping the temptations of anthropomorphising reproductive strategies\neither. Writing about male-male competition and the caretaking of infants by\nthe male marmoset monkeys who sire them, the primatologist Sarah Hrdy quipped\nin Mothers and Others (2009) that \u2018in the absence of DNA testing, it is\nimpossible [for the monkey] to know who the father is\u2019. But really, it\u2019s the\nabsence of the awareness that sex makes babies (which we\u2019re calling\nreproductive consciousness) that makes it impossible for a monkey to know who\nthe father is, or to have the concept of \u2018father\u2019 or paternity in the first\nplace. Something else is driving marmoset fathers to care for their own\nbiological offspring and not others.\n\nSo evolutionary speculation about the origin of human mating strategies not\nonly rests on science\u2019s tendency to \u2018zoomorphise\u2019 us. It also entangles\nscience in a dizzying web of anthropomorphic assumptions about other animals.\n\nYet as the cognitive scientist and anthropologist Daniel Povinelli writes in\n\u2018Behind the Ape\u2019s Appearance\u2019 (2004): \u2018if chimpanzees do not reason about\nunobservable entities, then we would frequently need distinctly different\nexplanations for human and chimpanzee behaviour \u2013 even in situations where the\nbehaviour looks almost identical\u2019. Chimpanzees deftly navigate a world with\ngravity without thinking about gravity, or rationalising about it and making\nrules. In an equally na\u00efve way, they deftly navigate a world with paternity\nwithout thinking of the consequences of sexual intercourse. But with our\nfundamentally similar ape ways, humans navigate a world where males are known\nto be intrinsic to babymaking, where males and females can have descendants\nand siblings, where beliefs about relatedness shape society and politics, and\nwhere relatives can inherit immaterial and material wealth to a degree and\ncomplexity that is unparalleled in the animal kingdom.\n\nWhen a dominant chimpanzee kills an unrelated infant, one set of explanations\nis needed. And it\u2019s not enough to map those directly, with no recognition of\nthe utterly distinct human experience of reproduction and family, on to human\ndomestic violence.\n\nHuman horniness is tethered to beliefs, to knowledge, to conscious\ncalculation, to past and to future\n\nInfluential ideas about the evolution of human pair-bonding also dismiss our\ndistinctiveness. In Primeval Kinship (2010), the primatologist Bernard Chapais\nwrote a book-length hypothesis for the evolution of human pair-bonding,\nmatrilineal and patrilineal descent groups, and exogamous (anti-inbreeding)\nmarriage patterns. Like many other scientists, Chapais interprets the very\npeculiar mating habits and family structures of humans as outcomes of standard\nprocesses of natural and sexual selection that favour particular mating\nstrategies for animals with particular niches and needs. Human mating\nstrategies can, as far as Chapais and many others are concerned, be understood\nwithout any reference to our peculiar self-consciousness about them.\n\nOur species\u2019 habit of pair-bonding, for example, is widely considered an\nadaptation to having particularly costly babies. They\u2019re so big (read: hungry)\nand so slow to grow to independence, that allomothering \u2013 infant care from\nother than the mother \u2013 not only from a baby\u2019s grandmother, maternal aunts and\nsisters, but also from the baby\u2019s brothers, father and his kin, enabled us to\ncontinue and maybe even thrive under these conditions. And that\u2019s not a bad\nexplanation as a starting point. It helps to explain why other primates, such\nas owl and marmoset monkeys, have invested fathers. Owl monkey fathers don\u2019t\n\u2018know\u2019 who their offspring are in the sense that humans \u2018know\u2019. But natural\nselection has favoured (or at least, not frowned upon) owl monkey fathers who\ncare for their offspring \u2013 they have a reproductive advantage and, insofar as\nthis behaviour is heritable, whether biologically or because it\u2019s learned, it\nwill be reproduced in further generations. On the surface, this looks akin to\nhuman behaviour, minus all the elaborate consequences of human paternity.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume that at the proximate level of attraction and\narousal we are close to other animals. But talk of \u2018animal instincts\u2019 is for\ndark and steamy trysts, not wedding vows. Human horniness is tethered to\nbeliefs, to knowledge, to conscious calculation, to past and to future. What\nis more, humans arrange marriages \u2013 sometimes from birth \u2013 greatly shaping\nhuman sexual behaviour over a lifetime. And new genetic studies show that\nmarriage is a very ancient human behaviour indeed. Because our species is\ninextricably steeped in sociocultural context, you could argue that all human\nmarriage is somehow arranged. This is a whole new approach to mate choice on\nthe evolutionary scene. Like other social animals, we do compete for mates and\nwe are choosy, but it\u2019s not just because we want to have sex with them, it\u2019s\nalso because we want to make babies with them, to merge families with theirs,\nto make a future together. Reproductive consciousness isn\u2019t just an aftermath\nto human mating. It has shaped it profoundly.\n\nIn his book Why Is Sex Fun? (1997), Jared Diamond writes that human sexuality\nis unusual because we often have sex for recreation rather than procreation.\nBut the popular emphasis on orgasms and acrobatics misses the mark. Animals\nhave sex for a smorgasbord of immediate reasons, including pleasure, yet no\nspecies knowingly has sex for procreation except us. So it\u2019s not just our Kama\nSutra-ness but it\u2019s also our reproductive consciousness that sets humans\napart. Sex isn\u2019t something that just happens to human beings. It\u2019s the fact\nthat we know what can happen when we do it that might be one of the turning\npoints in making humans unique inhabitants of the planet. Because of\nreproductive consciousness, humans know that they are related to one another:\ngrandparents, parents, siblings and children. And this knowledge \u2013 sex equals\nbabies, and babies equals kinship \u2013 marks one of the turning points of the\nhistory of life.\n\nSo how did we work it out in the first place?\n\nAs far as we know, there is no animal that spends time dwelling on what it\ncannot perceive with its senses other than the human animal. Understanding\nwhere babies come from can\u2019t simply be observed. It requires grasping that a\nrather routine activity today will have long-term consequences in the future \u2013\nconnecting a long-ago act to the baby mice, kittens, baby gorillas or newborn\nwhales and elephants born 20 days, two months, eight months, or almost two\nyears later. Among the few of us, including bonobos, that copulate while\npregnant \u2013 which can shrink the time between cause and effect \u2013 being able to\nlink the business and substance of sex to pregnancy and its outcome would\nstill take the kind of wild imagination that only humans are thought to\npossess. That, plus language, helps us to think these sorts of abstract\ncreations and to communicate them. Once we\u2019re a few years old, humans begin to\nexplain the unobservable. Soon thereafter, we\u2019re weaving and repeating stories\nabout where babies come from. And it\u2019s not much longer until we\u2019re seasoned\ngossips about tribe members.\n\nAbstract conceptual ability, what Povinelli refers to as a mind primed to\nthink about \u2018ghosts, gravity, and God\u2019, is among the few exceptional human\ntraits that primatologists, who are ever narrowing the divide between us and\nour closest non-human relatives, can embrace. To quote Povinelli: \u2018The mental\nlives of humans and chimpanzees are similar, in that both species form\ninnumerable (and in many cases, identical) concepts about observable things,\nbut, at the same time, are radically different, in that humans form additional\nconcepts about inherently unobservable things.\u2019 As far as we understand non-\nhuman cognition today, there is little to suggest that other animals hold\nbeliefs, material or spiritual, about pregnancy or babymaking, or that they\nunderstand that anyone is related to babies, especially males. Without a vivid\nimagination for the past and the future and the mysterious connections between\nthem, such an understanding couldn\u2019t exist.\n\nWe don\u2019t know when our human ancestors first began to reason abstractly in a\ndeeply imaginative way, and we certainly don\u2019t know when any first moments of\na-ha occurred, when anyone grasped that man + woman + whatever else they might\nimagine = baby. Scenarios for the origins of reproductive consciousness play\nout in fantastic works such as Jean M Auel\u2019s The Clan of the Cave Bear (1980)\nand its sequel The Valley of Horses (1982) but, outside of speculative\nfiction, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll ever know what happened with any certainty.\nHowever, there are traces of the cognitive development of humans that afford\ninteresting clues.\n\nSurely the control of fire offered an opportunity for hominins to observe how\norganic matter can transform, and to transfer those rules to sex and babies.\nThe best evidence for fire control doesn\u2019t appear until 800,000 years ago at a\nHomo erectus site in Israel, which is half a million years before anything\nevolved that we\u2019d call Homo sapiens. Perhaps it was cooking \u2013 we like to think\nof this as the \u2018bun in the oven\u2019 hypothesis \u2013 although bread itself is of\ncourse only a few thousand years old. Foraging for eggs would have revealed to\nancient hominins how amorphous fluid transforms into baby birds \u2013 an\nobservation begging to be transferred to baby humans. The earliest ostrich\neggshells with a definite human use, ingeniously used as containers to carry\nand store water, don\u2019t appear until the later Middle Stone Age of Africa\naround 60,000 years ago. Abstract thinking itself emerged long before this.\n\nIf reproductive consciousness is as old as the earliest archaeological\nevidence for our unique ability to think about the future, the past and\npresent, and to link far out causes and effects together, then it might have\noriginated as far back as 1.75 million years ago when Homo erectus began\ndeliberately shaping stones in the form of tear-dropped hand-axes. But\nultimately we can\u2019t know for sure what erectus brains could think about sex\nand kinship. If reproductive consciousness is possible only with our species-\nspecific brains, then it could have dawned on the first of our species, Homo\nsapiens, which means it could still be very ancient, going back some\n200,000-300,000 years. Given that it\u2019s likely that sapiens took some time to\nfire up its brain to modern capacity, then it\u2019s possible that reproductive\nconsciousness originated within the past 100,000 years when the archaeological\nrecord starts to boast the products of sophisticated abstract thinking with\nthose engraved eggshells, and also in etched rocks, carved stones and painted\ncaves.\n\nReproductive consciousness is a powerful context for boosting male-female\ncooperation, even beyond mates\n\nWhenever the cognitive ability arose, reproductive consciousness is almost\ncertainly as old as 100,000 years, and so the cultural byproducts of it must\nbe ancient too. Dowries, engagement rings and marriages are influenced by our\nunique cognition and culture, even if such traits have long been seen by\nevolutionary biologists as the bipedal ape\u2019s versions of what bush crickets,\nbower birds and wolves do.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the consequences that might run very deep in our past. Humans\naround the world form pair-bonds within larger communities. We are generally\nnot promiscuous, like chimpanzees and bonobos, despite the tremendous\nopportunity around us. Sure, we cheat, but most partnered humans are as\nreproductively faithful as physically isolated gorillas and gibbons, even with\nfar greater opportunities to sleep around. And while many diverse cultures\npromote or tolerate polygamy, monogamy is far more common in reality, even\nwithin putatively polygamous societies. This human tendency to bond in pairs\ncould have evolved, as Bernard Chapais and others have hypothesised, because\nof a long series of ecological shifts in the past several million years of our\nevolutionary history, including selection for allomothering males. Whether\nit\u2019s an alternative or a complement to this idea, reproductive consciousness\nlikely also played a role in the evolution of people\u2019s ability and desire to\nform exclusive sexual partnerships within a larger community.\n\nBeliefs about relatedness and about babymaking could have factored into mate\nchoice and competition for a long time, in a particularly human kind of sexual\nselection. Reproductive consciousness would have increased attraction to and\ncompetition for mates, male or female, who are observed to be good community\nmembers and good parents, or who have potential to be. It would have increased\ncompetition for mates or for families with resources they\u2019re willing to share.\nReproductive consciousness is a powerful context for boosting male-female\ncooperation, even beyond mates and into adult brother-sister relationships \u2013\neffectively a uniquely human phenomenon. The understanding of paternity would\nalso have boosted brother-brother bonds. Although chimpanzee males cooperate,\nbrothers are not intentionally befriended. Humans take nepotism far beyond\nwhere other primates go because we know about relatedness, and we encode it\nwith meaning and value.\n\nA very rich example can be found in incest taboos that are, like pair-bonding,\nwidespread in human societies, enough to be virtually universal. The standard\nevolutionary interpretation of human incest taboos runs like this: human\nincest taboos and animal inbreeding avoidance are general evolutionary\nstrategies for preventing very rare, debilitating genetic traits in offspring.\nMany animal species practise matrilocality and patrilocality. That is, females\nor males remain in their natal group, and the opposite sex (sometimes both\nsexes) leaves their natal group as they reach reproductive age. This exogamy\nis common among non-human primates and other animals, and results in\n\u2018inbreeding avoidance\u2019. However, we\u2019ve learned from genetic studies that the\nrisks from inbreeding have been overblown; it doesn\u2019t lead to harmful traits\nnearly as often as this view has led us to believe. Other species have mating\nstrategies that don\u2019t avoid incest: banded mongoose females, for example,\nbreed readily with their brothers and fathers.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that human incest taboos are rooted in some biological factors\nunderpinning aversion and attraction, which seem to urge us to mate outside\nour familiar immediate family. However, such taboos can be just as robustly\ninterpreted as a product of our reproductive consciousness, which in turn has\ninfluenced cultural norms. Reproductive consciousness enables a calculation of\nrelationships and reciprocity that is impossible for other animals. Socially\nenforced incest taboos keep fathers from monopolising daughters who would do\nbetter, for the family, if they married and reproduced with someone outside\nthe family instead. Incest taboos force individuals to marry into someone\nelse\u2019s family, which results in benefits to their parents and siblings through\nalliance-building. And such social norms themselves have a profound effect on\nreproduction, not just of individuals but also of culture. Rather than simply\nmapping animal models onto human reproduction, when we take into account the\ndistinctive human achievement of reproductive consciousness, we can interpret\nincest taboos as operating to control sexuality in order to optimise social,\npolitical and economic outcomes, even at the expense of optimising genetic\nones.\n\nThis is not to say that incest taboos are entirely cultural phenomena. Despite\nnot being coded in DNA, a socially mandated incest taboo can lead to\ndifferential reproductive success for individuals who practise it, thus\nbecoming an influence on human biology, not just a product of it. Incest\ntaboos discourage instant gratification to favour the long-view and all its\nspoils. And so culture in turn is able to affect biological evolution.\n\nReproductive consciousness is just one element in the invention of human\nculture \u2013 a whole cluster of behaviours, knowledge, values and beliefs that\nunhooks human destiny from the standard evolutionary model of other species.\nWe humans do many things that undermine our evolutionary interests. We\npractise religious celibacy, contraception, abortion, suicide bombing. We\nadopt infants who aren\u2019t our kin, we go to war, we kill our siblings. A lot of\nthis we do voluntarily, and none of it perpetuates our own genes. In fact, it\nactively does not.\n\nReproductive consciousness transforms human beings and families into human\nlineages, inextricably intertwined with other bloodlines, passing along and\nexchanging genes just like any other animal, but also transmitting immaterial\nand material culture across and down through the generations, which in turn\naffects the fates of the genes going forward as well. Understanding that sex\nmakes babies has allowed us to create social norms and expectations about when\nand with whom we reproduce that biologically driven behaviour alone could\nnever have done. But our understanding that sex makes babies has done much\nmore than shape human destiny. It has changed the entire planet through our\nmanipulation of other species to our own ends.\n\nAt the end of the last Ice Age, some 10,000-12,000 years ago, people began the\ntransition from foraging to farming. This shift defines the beginning of the\nNeolithic and forms the foundations for the Anthropocene, the present age of\nvisible human impact on the Earth\u2019s ecosystems that might soon become an\nofficial geologic epoch. Archaeologists still argue about why this change\nhappened where and when it did. Either farming offered advantages that\nforaging did not, or foraging became unsustainable, and people had no choice\nbut to adopt a new way of life. Perhaps it was some of both. Whatever the\ncause, the transition was slow and patchy, taking hundreds or even thousands\nof years.\n\nDomestication is essentially predation with forethought and evolutionary\nintent. Early farmers were the first to replace natural selection with\nartificial selection. They had to decide which seeds to plant (if in fact to\nplant them at all), which animals to cull from wild herds that lived nearby,\nto corral animals for meat, wool, hides, milk, blood and so on. By all\nprofessional accounts, cultivation \u2013 that is tending animals and plants\nwithout choosing to breed subsets for specific traits \u2013 preceded\ndomestication, but even without practising artificial selection, cultivators,\nlike their hunter-gatherer ancestors, possessed a wealth of knowledge about\nnature. Farmers must have known that pollination and mating were prerequisites\nfor the next generation of plants and animals, and this must have made them\nbetter at gardening and animal husbandry. Palaeolithic peoples had\nsophisticated symbolic language and extensive knowledge of animal and plant\nbehaviours. This would certainly have included an understanding of sex and\nreproduction.\n\nDomestication of goats, sheep or cows reflects an understanding of the role of\nsex in producing animals with desired characteristics, such as docility, herd\nbehaviour and fatty milk. Farmers realised that parent animals with these\ntraits would be likely to produce offspring with the same traits, and this\nwould have informed their decisions about which animals they would allow to\nreproduce. At some point people also understood that selective pollination\ncould drive a food crop in a particular direction as well \u2013 seeds that all\nripen at the same time, seeds that stay on the plant until the farmer wants to\nharvest them, seeds that taste better, and so forth. Whether early farmers\nunderstood that pollination was essentially plant sex is unknown, but\ndomestication \u2013 purposeful, human-driven artificial selection rather than\nsimply taking advantage of what natural selection or chance delivered \u2013 was a\nfundamental part of the transition to agriculture, and that couldn\u2019t have\nhappened without reproductive consciousness.\n\nThe transition to agriculture brought the beginning of settled life, the\ngrowth of villages and towns, and eventually cities, with dramatic population\ngrowth and ensuing environmental, epidemiological, cultural and political\nconsequences. Without reproductive consciousness, human history would have\nbeen utterly different.\n\nNow, it\u2019s true that humans aren\u2019t the only animals that farm. Ants farm\naphids, damselfish farm algae, leafcutter ants grow fungi on the leaves they\ncollect. However, as far as we know, they aren\u2019t consciously breeding selected\nfungi or aphids specifically to engineer the traits of future generations.\nThis isn\u2019t domestication, and it\u2019s not farming as we know it. Domestication\nrequires reproductive consciousness and, without it, the ecological leviathan\nof agricultural and industrial human society would not have been possible.\n\nSomeone left a cuneiform note in the Sumerian city of Eridu in Iraq,\ndescribing how the penis, specifically the god Enki\u2019s, is a creative force\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s not surprising, then, that early agricultural civilisations have\na wealth of stories and myths about fertility. More than 2,000 years ago,\ninscriptions on an Egyptian wall reveal the life-creating abilities of the\npenis. Hieroglyphs tell of how the male god Atum masturbated the universe into\nexistence. A thousand years before that, someone left a cuneiform note in the\nSumerian city of Eridu in Iraq, describing how the penis, specifically the god\nEnki\u2019s, is a creative force, with Enki\u2019s bearing the rivers Tigris and\nEuphrates. The Code of Hammurabi, as translated into English, suggests that\nBabylonian men were very aware that they help to create offspring via sexual\nintercourse.\n\nIn the Bible, when God told Adam and Eve to \u2018be fruitful and multiply\u2019, he was\ntransferring creative power to their capable loins. Later in the script, the\nTen Commandments demand that we honour our father and mother, that we not\ncommit adultery, and that we do not covet our neighbour\u2019s wife. From a similar\ntime, in The Twelve Tables (450 BCE), the earliest coded Roman law that has\nsurvived recorded history, appears to demonstrate a fairly sound empirical\nunderstanding of reproduction. For example, in Table IV.5 it says: \u2018A child\nborn after 10 months since the father\u2019s death will not be admitted into a\nlegal inheritance.\u2019 Tracking gestation length to legitimise human children was\npart of the law by then, despite it predating any scientific understanding of\nreproduction by 2,000 years.\n\nThe fundamental arithmetic of human reproduction might be ancient knowledge,\nbut an accurate understanding of the detailed logistics of conception and\nembryonic development were more elusive. We have a great deal of evidence from\nethnographic sources that, while the male role in reproduction seems to be\nuniversally acknowledged, the precise details of this vary widely from culture\nto culture. Among lowlands peoples in the Amazon Basin, there has been a\nwidespread belief that multiple men can contribute to producing a single\nchild, their semen building up or anointing the foetus during pregnancy. At\nthe turn of the 20th century, anthropologists such as Bronislaw Malinowski in\nThe Father in Primitive Psychology (1927), and Douglas Lockwood in I, the\nAboriginal (1962), recorded the stories of peoples of the South Pacific and\nAustralia who believed that penetrating intercourse opens up a woman or makes\n\u2018the road\u2019 for conception.\n\nHowever, Malinowski had a narrow view of these belief systems. He was set on\nexplaining the origins of puzzling societies where there was a matrilineal\npattern of ancestry within a patriarchal power structure. This, he argued, was\nbecause these cultures lacked an understanding of paternity, of how babies are\nmade. Of the peoples of the Trobriand Islands, part of Papua New Guinea, he\nwrote that they \u2018have a well-established institution of marriage, but are\nquite ignorant of the man\u2019s share in the begetting of children, the \u201cfather\u201d\nhas for the Trobriander a purely social definition: he is the man married to\nthe mother, who lives in the same house with her and forms part of the\nhousehold\u2019. To Malinowski, \u2018the idea that it is solely and exclusively the\nmother who builds up the child\u2019s body, while the male does not in any way\ncontribute to its production, is the most important factor of the social\norganisation of the Trobrianders\u2019. So, in a patriarchy without paternity, if\nthe mother cannot carry the status, her brother does, and these ideas had\nintellectual impacts far and wide. It is now popularly assumed that there were\npeople \u2013 at least as recently as 100 years ago \u2013 who didn\u2019t know where babies\ncome from. This is probably incorrect.\n\nMalinowski was fixated on his informants\u2019 \u2018absence of any idea of the\nfertilising value of semen\u2019, using it to generalise that they ignored the\nmale\u2019s role. Yet they had already told him that sex with men is what primes a\nwoman\u2019s fertility. So, regardless of the details, sex and men are still\nhelping women to make baby Trobrianders. He also records a belief that\nspiritual action is, to quote his informants, \u2018the real cause of child-birth\u2019.\nBut this is not so odd, nor incompatible with reproductive consciousness.\nAfter all, many Americans, in polite or unfamiliar company or in earshot of\nchildren, won\u2019t talk about sex; God makes babies. Perhaps the problem was, in\npart, Malinowski\u2019s own fixation on semen. He quotes one informant\u2019s apparently\nincorrect explanation for reproduction to be: \u2018The mother feeds the infant in\nher body. Then, when it comes out, she feeds it with her milk\u2019; and \u2018The\nmother makes the child out of her flesh.\u2019 Yet if we wanted to be purely\nmaterialistic, this could be considered more correct than the genome-centric\nview of babymaking. Egg and sperm and the genomes they carry are next to\nnothing compared with the food, flesh and milk that build a baby. Babies are\ncertainly more mother\u2019s blood and milk than they are egg or sperm, but a\nperson\u2019s intellect might be questioned if they said so today.\n\nUntil we can make synthetic babies from scratch in vats, we are stuck with\nmuch of the old apparatus of parenting\n\nIn the Western world, theories about the relative contributions of man and\nwoman to the making of a baby have also been the subject of much speculation\nand debate. \u2018Preformation\u2019, the pre-Enlightenment idea that we were formed as\nwe look now from the start and merely grow up, imagined something like every\nwoman containing an infinitely stacked Russian doll of her future progeny.\nOnce sperm were first seen by Anton van Leeuwenhoek under his microscope in\n1677, a similar concept was transferred to males, reinforcing the image of the\nwomb as a vessel that welcomes impregnation from a man. Around 1870,\nexplanations of conception drew much closer to what we have today. What the\nanthropologists Steven Beckerman and Paul Valentine call the \u2018One Sperm, One\nFertilisation Doctrine\u2019 had its origins in 19th-century Austria when Gregor\nMendel obtained experimental evidence that a single pollen grain introduced\ninto an ovule produced a well-developed seed.\n\nRecently, The New York Times reported that scientists were on the verge of\nmaking \u2018people without biological parents\u2019. This describes hypothetical,\nsynthetic human genomes grown inside embryos in vitro. But unless scientists\nare also synthesising eggs and sperm (both of which contribute more than DNA\nto offspring), and wombs, and women too, then they haven\u2019t removed parents\nfrom their required role in reproduction. The same is true of cloning living\nor recently extinct species. Any synthetic human genome will be constrained by\nwhat works for Homo sapiens and what has worked for more than 3.7 billion\nyears. A synthetic genome is part of a larger process that is influenced by\nthe humans who built it and the agents they used in the laboratory, as well as\nthe woman who carries the pregnancy to term, and all who influence her biology\nwhile she is pregnant, and while her own mother was pregnant with her, and all\nthe biological influences from the child\u2019s caregivers. Until we can make\nsynthetic babies from scratch in vats, we are stuck with much of the old\napparatus of parenting.\n\nBy contrast, scientists have successfully removed some other old-timey\nnecessities from human reproduction. In-vitro fertilisation removes sexual\nintercourse from the equation, and it also removes seminal fluid because sperm\nis plucked and washed prior to meeting an egg. But even now, our beliefs are\nevolving about the necessity of seminal fluid since it\u2019s been recently\ndiscovered that its absence likely influences the biology of the placenta and\nthe progeny, particularly the metabolic traits of the offspring.\n\nAs ever, our cultural and scientific beliefs are evolving about the necessity\nof intercourse for making babies. The \u2018seminal-priming\u2019 hypothesis suggests\nthat exposure to semen improves fertility for women and couples who, for\nexample, are at risk of developing a pre-eclamptic pregnancy which risks\nfoetal and maternal survival. So although some reproduction is now feasible\nwithout sex or semen, it seems not all of it is. And, while all our new-style\nmeans for babymaking can affect culturally prescribed kinship, the\nrelationships that arise with a new baby are generally based on knowledge of\nthe provenance of the egg and the sperm, which boil it all back down to that\nfamiliar fundamental equation of man + woman + wild imagination = baby. No\nmatter how much we tinker with the specifics, reproductive consciousness\nremains a constant of human identity, from the Trobriand Islands and ancient\nEgypt to modern-day New York.\n\nJust as we don\u2019t know when our ancestors acquired language, we don\u2019t know when\nreproductive consciousness arose. But we do know that each is ancient, and was\npresent worldwide when European explorers first encountered and reported on\nisolated indigenous peoples. Because we are human, our ability to explain the\nunobservable, to understand that men help to make babies and that we are\nrelated to one another, has profoundly affected the social structures we\u2019ve\ndevised, the rules about who can have sex with whom, and formed a basis for\nwide-ranging cooperation on large-scale projects. It has driven our\nrelationship with the plants and animals we\u2019ve domesticated for food and\nlabour, and this in turn has altered the land on which we live. If it didn\u2019t\nspark the Anthropocene, reproductive consciousness has certainly deeply\naffected its trajectory. Knowledge is evolutionary power.\n\nAcknowledging the centrality of reproductive consciousness to so much of our\npast as well as our present gives us a novel way to reframe how we explain\nmuch of human behaviour. Culture is something truly extraordinary about our\nspecies, and it is intellectually presumptuous to dismiss its role in human\nevolution. Evolutionary theory doesn\u2019t explain virginity, the use of\ncontraception, or \u2018until death us do part\u2019 as convincingly as the simple fact\nthat culture is powerful, and culture is informed by reproductive\nconsciousness, and a whole suite of institutions and conventions built out of\nit.\n\nThere are scientists hard at work on fitting culture into the framework of\nhuman evolution. In Not By Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human\nEvolution (2005), the anthropologists Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd suggest\nthat we have evolved unique tribal social instincts, on top of our ancient\nprimate social instincts \u2018that allow us to interact cooperatively with a\nlarger, symbolically marked set of people, or tribe. The tribal social\ninstincts result from the gene-culture co-evolution of tribal-scale\nsocieties.\u2019 And they suggest that this is why \u2018humans are able to make common\ncause with a sizeable, culturally defined set of distantly related\nindividuals, a form of social organisation that is absent in other primates\u2019.\nBut one aspect of human sociality is desperately missing from these sorts of\nconversations \u2013 reproductive consciousness.\n\nWhen the creative power of our own bodies dawned on our ancestors, we seized a\npowerful role in our own behaviour\n\nOur argument is not that culture is more powerful than biology, or vice versa.\nWe simply wish to acknowledge that it belongs alongside biology in our\nevolutionary reconstruction of sex, sexuality, reproduction and kinship. If\nculture has been a factor in hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years\nof hominin tool-making, then it has most likely also been there for the\nbabymaking. Perhaps it\u2019s just been easier to elevate and to contrast our\nmaterial culture against all other species\u2019 than it has to incorporate the\nimportance of our immaterial culture. But what\u2019s more material than the\nmanufacture of flesh and blood offspring?\n\nEarly on in anthropology, studies of procreative beliefs and kinship such as\nMalinowski\u2019s were explicitly concerned with understanding human evolution and\nimagining the lives of our ancestors. However, this style of research fell far\nfrom fashion as cultural anthropologists sought to distance themselves from\nresearch on human evolution. And rightly so: living peoples are not relics of\nthe Stone Age and are not identical with our extinct ancestors.\n\nNow that the dust has settled somewhat, however, scholars are reviving the\nconnection between uniquely human kinship and its importance for the\nunderstanding of our ancient past. Putting it simply, humans have families in\nways that no other animals do. In Early Human Kinship (2011), the\nanthropologist Wendy James encourages thinkers from science and the humanities\nto come together \u2018on the very important question of how evolutionary theory\ncould or should take account of the ordered character of human organisation,\nspecifically ... how we try to manage patterns of male-female and parent-child\nrelations, and thus the purposeful outcomes of our own reproduction\u2019.\n\nJust how far back to push that purposeful impact we make on ourselves might\nnever be known. But when the creative power of our own bodies dawned on our\nancestors, we seized a powerful role in our own behaviour, and sometimes a\npowerful role over our descendants, future tribe members, fellow humans, and\nkindreds of all kinds on Mother Earth. Or putting it in truly human terms:\nkindred of all kinds on Mother and Father Earth.\n\nHuman evolutionHuman reproductionSex and sexuality\n\n9 August 2017\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHuman rights and justice\n\nMy elusive pain\n\nThe lives of North Africans in France are shaped by a harrowing struggle to\nbelong, marked by postcolonial trauma\n\nFarah Abdessamad\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nNeuroscience\n\nHow to make a map of smell\n\nWe can split light by a prism, sounds by tones, but surely the world of odour\nis too complex and personal?
