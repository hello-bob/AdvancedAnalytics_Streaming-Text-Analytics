Stearns has written about brand safety on X for Hill\nReporter, a progressive news site.\n\nJoe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, confirmed the Hyundai pause\nin an email Thursday in response to questions. He said X was working with\nHyundai\u2019s marketers to put in place further brand safety controls.\n\nX also suspended the account that made the antisemitic posts. The account\u2019s\nbio included antisemitic tropes that violated X\u2019s policy against abusive\nprofiles, Benarroch said. A note on the account Thursday afternoon said it was\n\u201ctemporarily unavailable\u201d because it violated policy.\n\nBenarroch also said a Holocaust-denial post that appeared adjacent to a\nHyundai ad would get a label as violating X\u2019s policy on \u201cviolent event\ndenial.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an NBC News investigation documented how X has become a hub for\npro-Nazi content. X\u2019s policies ban glorifying violence and praising violent\nentities.\n\nHyundai is the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales volume, after Toyota\nand Volkswagen. Its headquarters are in South Korea, and its brands include\nKia.\n\nThe recent Hyundai ad in question ran on the profile of a user who has\ndefended Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and pushed antisemitic conspiracy theories.\nBefore Thursday\u2019s suspension, the account said it was based in Australia. It\nposted under a pseudonym and had more than 55,000 followers.\n\nThe account for months has had a blue checkmark signaling that it is a paid\n\u201cPremium\u201d subscriber. This month, X began giving blue checkmarks to some\nunpaid users with more than 2,500 verified followers, making it more difficult\nto determine who is a paid subscriber, but the account in question has had its\nblue checkmark for longer.\n\nNBC News reported Tuesday that under Musk\u2019s ownership, X has become a thriving\nspot for explicitly pro-Nazi content, including speeches by Hitler or content\npraising his genocidal regime. NBC News found that at least 150 paid \u201cPremium\u201d\nsubscriber accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts had posted or amplified\npro-Nazi content in recent months, often in apparent violation of X\u2019s rules.\n\nSome pro-Nazi content has spread widely, including a post last month with 1.9\nmillion views promoting a false and long-debunked conspiracy theory that 6\nmillion Jews did not die in the Holocaust. On Thursday, X added a label to the\npost, saying: \u201cVisibility limited: this Post may violate X\u2019s rules against\nHateful Conduct.\u201d\n\nNBC News found ads running on 74 of the 150 \u201cPremium\u201d accounts, either on\ntheir profile pages or in the replies below their posts.\n\n### Recommended\n\nTech News\n\n### Tech NewsMultistate 911 outage shows fragility of systems, experts say\n\nIsrael-Hamas war\n\n### Israel-Hamas warGoogle fires 28 workers for protesting $1.2 billion Israel\ncontract\n\nAnother X advertiser, IQAir, said it was adjusting its settings on the\nplatform after NBC News found one of its ads running adjacent to Holocaust\ndenial. IQAir, a Swiss company that makes air quality devices and software,\nsaid it was already using X\u2019s features designed to let advertisers target\ncertain audiences and exclude other audiences.\n\n\u201cOur advertisements are set up so that ideally, they do not allow X to reach\naccounts beyond our target audience,\u201d the company said in an email.\n\n\u201cHowever, based on the screen shot you provided, it appears that did not occur\nin this case,\u201d it said. The company said it did not know why its ad would\nappear next to extremist content.\n\nX offers advertisers a feature called \u201cnegative targeting\u201d designed to stop\nads from being placed near certain keywords. However, the system does not by\ndefault include all potentially problematic keywords. IQAir said it was adding\na Holocaust denial hashtag to its list of excluded keywords, and X said it was\ndemonetizing searches for the same hashtag and making the hashtag ineligible\nto appear in trending lists or in search results.\n\n\u201cWe do not condone our advertisements running in conjunction with this or any\nother form of extremist content,\u201d IQAir said.\n\nX said it had suspended one account whose Holocaust-denial post had appeared\nnext to an IQAir ad. The account had an abusive profile, Benarroch said. X\nalso applied a label for \u201chateful conduct\u201d to another antisemitic post, he\nsaid.\n\nNBC News does not have a comprehensive list of advertisers that use X. Each\naccount on social media sees different ads at different times, so it is\nunknown how many advertisers\u2019 ads have run next to pro-Nazi content or\nHolocaust denial posts.\n\nX has faced a widespread advertiser backlash since November, when Musk\nembraced the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d which says there is a top-down plot\nto replace the white population with nonwhite people. Musk responded to a post\nby a conspiracy theorist by saying, \u201cYou have said the actual truth.\u201d\n\nDozens of major advertisers, including Disney, Apple and Warner Bros., halted\ntheir advertising on X, and as of February many had not resumed. According to\nthe research firm Sensor Tower, 75 out of the top 100 U.S. advertisers on X\nfrom October 2022 were not buying ads as of February.\n\nMusk visited Israel later in November and traveled to the former Nazi death\ncamp Auschwitz in January.\n\nMusk, also the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said after the Auschwitz visit that he\ndid not know much about antisemitism and considered himself \u201cJewish by\nassociation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must admit to being somewhat frankly naive about this. In the circles that\nI move, I see almost no antisemitism. ... Two-thirds of my friends are\nJewish,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Ingram\n\nDavid Ingram covers tech for NBC News.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
