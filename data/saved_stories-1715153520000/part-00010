The application to\nwithdraw the vaccine was made on March 5 and came into effect on Tuesday.\n\nSimilar applications will be made in the coming months in the UK and in other\ncountries that had approved the vaccine, known as Vaxzevria.\n\nThe decision to withdraw it brings to an end the use of the jab, which was\nheralded by Boris Johnson as a \u201ctriumph for British science\u201d and credited with\nsaving more than six million lives.\n\nAstraZeneca said the vaccine was being removed from markets for commercial\nreasons. It said the vaccine was no longer being manufactured or supplied,\nhaving been superseded by updated vaccines that tackle new variants.\n\nVaxzevria has come under intense scrutiny in recent months over a very rare\nside effect, which causes blood clots and low blood platelet counts.\nAstraZeneca admitted in court documents lodged with the High Court in February\nthat the vaccine \u201ccan, in very rare cases, cause TTS\u201d.\n\nTTS \u2013 which stands for Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome \u2013 has been\nlinked to at least 81 deaths in the UK as well as hundreds of serious\ninjuries. AstraZeneca is being sued by more than 50 alleged victims and\ngrieving relatives in a High Court case.\n\nBut AstraZeneca has insisted the decision to withdraw the vaccine is not\nlinked to the court case or its admission that it can cause TTS. It said the\ntiming was pure coincidence.\n\nIn a statement the company said: \u201cWe are incredibly proud of the role\nVaxzevria played in ending the global pandemic. According to independent\nestimates, over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone\nand over three billion doses were supplied globally.\n\n\u201cOur efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are\nwidely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic.\n\n\u201cAs multiple, variant Covid-19 vaccines have since been developed, there is a\nsurplus of available updated vaccines. This has led to a decline in demand for\nVaxzevria, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied. AstraZeneca has\ntherefore taken the decision to initiate withdrawal of the marketing\nauthorisations for Vaxzevria within Europe.\n\n\u201cWe will now work with regulators and our partners to align on a clear path\nforward to conclude this chapter and significant contribution to the Covid-19\npandemic.\u201d\n\nThe Telegraph has been told that the company will withdraw marketing\nauthorisations in other countries, including the UK, where it has regulatory\napproval. AstraZeneca never had approval for the vaccine to be used in the US.\n\nThe company said: \u201cWe will partner with regulatory authorities globally to\ninitiate marketing authorisation withdrawals for Vaxzevria, where no future\ncommercial demand for the vaccine is expected.\u201d\n\nThe Government largely stopped using the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine by the\nautumn of 2021, by which time it had supplied about 50 million doses in the\nUK. It was replaced in the UK with Pfizer and Moderna jabs in time for the\nwinter booster campaign at the end of 2021.\n\nMarco Cavaleri, head of vaccines at the European Medicines Agency, the body\nwhich is responsible for drug and medicine safety within the EU, told Italian\nmedia: \u201cThe authorisation of the anti-Covid vaccine Vaxzevria by AstraZeneca\nwill be withdrawn and the process has already officially started with the\nEuropean Commission. This is in line with the expectations that no-longer-used\nand updated vaccines will be withdrawn, as per our indication.\u201d\n\nMr Cavaleri said he expected all the \u201cmonovalent\u201d vaccines \u2013 which dealt only\nwith the original Wuhan strain \u2013 to be withdrawn in time.\n\nAstraZeneca accepted the vaccine can cause TTS in a legal document in February\nthis year. The causal mechanism is not known.\n\nWorkers producing the vaccine in October 2021 Credit: JOHN LAWRENCE\n\nLawyers for claimants in the High Court case argue that the drug caused\nvaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) \u2013 a subset of\nTTS \u2013 and that it was not as safe as individuals were entitled to expect.\nAstraZeneca has always insisted that \u201cpatient safety is our highest priority\u201d.\n\nThe company has said: \u201cFrom the body of evidence in clinical trials and real-\nworld data, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has continuously been shown to have\nan acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently\nstate that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare\npotential side effects.\u201d\n\nBut Kate Scott, whose husband Jamie was left with a permanent brain injury\nafter having the vaccine and who was the first person in the UK to bring a\nlegal action, said: \u201cAstraZeneca\u2019s Covid vaccine no longer being used in the\nUK or Europe, and soon the rest of the world, means no one else will suffer\nfrom this awful adverse reaction.\n\n\u201cThey say it is for commercial reasons, but maybe it\u2019s because it can no\nlonger be seen as being within the acceptable safety parameters, with 445\nconfirmed cases of VITT, 81 of these fatal in the UK alone.\u201d\n\nMr Scott, 47, a father of two who has had to give up work, said: \u201cThis is good\nnews, but I will always wish they had, like they did in other countries,\npaused it in the UK after just one case. More lives could have been saved and\nI would not be suffering the way I am.\u201d\n\nMr Scott, pictured with his wife, wishes the vaccine had been withdrawn much\nearlier Credit: ANDREW FOX\n\nSarah Moore, a partner at law firm Leigh Day, which is bringing the legal\nclaims, said: \u201cTo those who we represent, all of whom have suffered\nbereavement or serious injury as a result of the AstraZeneca vaccine, this\ndecision to withdraw marketing authorisation, ending the usage of the\nAstraZeneca vaccine in the EU, will be welcomed.\n\n\u201cIt will be seen as a decision linked with AstraZeneca\u2019s recent admission that\nthe vaccine can cause TTS, and the fact that regulators across the world\nsuspended or stopped usage of the vaccine following concerns regarding TTS.\n\n\u201cThis is an important regulatory step, but still our clients remain without\nfair compensation. We will continue to fight for the compensation our clients\nneed and campaign for reform of the vaccine damage payment scheme.\u201d\n\nThe scheme, run by the Government, has paid out to victims. But it has been\nbranded inadequate, prompting them to bring separate civil claims against\nAstraZeneca, which the drugs firm is contesting.\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * AstraZeneca,\n  * Vaccines,\n  * Pandemics and epidemics\n\n419\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
