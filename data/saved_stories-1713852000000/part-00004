However, in the spring of 2023, Twitter (now called X)\n> began changing $42,000/month for its Enterprise access level, an essential\n> death knell for researcher use. Lacking sufficient funds to pay this monthly\n> fee, academics are now scrambling to continue their research without this\n> important data source. This study collects and tabulates the number of\n> studies, number of citations, dates, major disciplines, and major topic\n> areas of studies that used Twitter data between 2006 and 2023. While we\n> cannot know for certain what will be lost now that Twitter data is cost\n> prohibitive, we can illustrate its research value during the time it was\n> available. A search of 8 databases and 3 related APIs found that since 2006,\n> a total of 27,453 studies have been published in 7,432 publication venues,\n> with 1,303,142 citations, across 14 disciplines. Major disciplines include:\n> computational social science, engineering, data science, social media\n> studies, public health, and medicine. Major topics include: information\n> dissemination, assessing the credibility of tweets, strategies for\n> conducting data research, detecting and analyzing major events, and studying\n> human behavior. Twitter data studies have increased every year since 2006,\n> but following Twitter's decision to begin charging for data in the spring of\n> 2023, the number of studies published in 2023 decreased by 13% compared to\n> 2022. We assume that much of the data used for studies published in 2023\n> were collected prior to Twitter's shutdown, and thus the number of new\n> studies are likely to decline further in subsequent years.\n\nComments:| 16 pages, 4 figures, 4 appendices  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computers and Society (cs.CY)  \nACM classes:| J.4; K.4  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.07340 [cs.CY]  \n(or arXiv:2404.07340v1 [cs.CY] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.07340arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Ryan Murtfeldt [view email] [v1] Wed, 10 Apr 2024 20:39:24 UTC (785 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled RIP Twitter API: A eulogy to its vast research\ncontributions, by Ryan Murtfeldt and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CY\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
