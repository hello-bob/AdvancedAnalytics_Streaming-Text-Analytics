Nvidia\ncommands some 80 per cent of the global AI chip market.\n\nNvidia chief executive Jensen Huang unveils the company\u2019s new graphics\nprocessing unit design, called Blackwell, that is multiple times faster at\nhandling artificial intelligence projects at an event in San Jose, California,\non March 18, 2024.

It plans to provide samples for its\n12-layer HBM3E chips to customers in March.\n\n\u201cAs AI functions and performance are being upgraded faster than expected,\ncustomer demand for ultra-high-performance chips such as the 12-layer chips\nappear to be increasing faster than for 8-layer HBM3Es,\u201d said Jeff Kim, head\nof research at KB Securities.\n\nSamsung, which plans to produce its HBM3E 12-layer chips in the second\nquarter, said this week that this year\u2019s shipments of HBM chips are expected\nto increase more than three-fold and that it has completed supply discussions\nwith customers. The company did not elaborate further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, SK Hynix announced a US$3.87 billion plan to build an advanced\nchip packaging plant in the US state of Indiana with an HBM chip line and a\n5.3 trillion won (US$3.9 billion) investment in a new DRAM chip factory at\nhome with a focus on HBMs.\n\nMemory chips made by South Korean semiconductor company SK Hynix are seen on a\ncomputer circuit board on February 25, 2022.
