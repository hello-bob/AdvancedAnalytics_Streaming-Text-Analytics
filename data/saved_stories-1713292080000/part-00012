But sometimes small clumps of\nabnormal cells grow on the colon\u2019s lining and turn into cancer. Colon cancer\nis relatively common but tricky to catch; it can only be confirmed with a\ncolonoscopy or surgery. And a recent, so-far-unexplained rise in colon cancer\nrates among younger people has ramped up urgency in learning more about how\nthe disease works\u2014and how to prevent it.\n\nPinning down colon cancer\u2019s genetic or environmental causes has been a complex\nand long-running quest, but a new study in Nature points to a promising clue:\na bacterium typically found in the human mouth. The study found that a\nspecific subtype, or clade, within a subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum was\nlinked to colon cancer growth and progression. These results, the study\nauthors say, could lead to better noninvasive diagnostic methods for colon\ncancer and could even suggest new therapies targeting these bacteria for tumor\nelimination.\n\nF. nucleatum, associated with dental plaque and gingivitis, occurs naturally\nin the mouth microbiome. A decade ago scientists discovered that the bacterium\nwas also found in colon cancer more often than in normal colon tissue. \u201cThis\nwas particularly interesting because this microbe in noncancerous individuals\nis usually not present below the [mouth],\u201d says the new study\u2019s co-senior\nauthor Susan Bullman, a biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.\n\nTo further explore the microbe\u2019s relationship to colon cancer, Bullman and her\ncolleagues conducted extensive sequencing on F. nucleatum within colon cancer\ntumors and looked at how the microbe influenced the intestinal environment.\nThe team first analyzed the genomes of F. nucleatum found in colon tumors in\norder to compare them with those found in the mouth. It collected colon tumors\nfrom approximately 100 people and then broke up the tumors and placed them on\nagar plates to allow the microbes present to grow.\n\nAfter isolating the F. nucleatum from these cultures, the scientists performed\na process called long-read sequencing to get a comprehensive look at the\nbacterium\u2019s genome. Most traditional sequencing methods rely on what\nscientists call \u201cshort reads\u201d\u2014which is like \u201cassembling a puzzle where you\u2019re\nnot able to get the whole picture,\u201d says the study\u2019s first author, Martha\nZepeda-Rivera. \u201cWith long-read sequencing, it\u2019s like taking a picture with\nyour camera, where you get the entire picture.\u201d\n\nThe team compared these sequences from the colon cancer tissues with those of\nF. nucleatum from the mouth of healthy individuals. This revealed two main\nclades within a subspecies (called F. nucleatum animalis) that were\ndistinguished by differences in DNA bases and patterns of encoded proteins.\nBacteria in the two clades also had distinct appearances under the microscope:\nspecimens in the second clade were longer and thinner than those from the\nfirst.\n\nF. nucleatum animalis from the colon tumors fell overwhelmingly into the\nsecond clade. This clade\u2019s genomes seemed to code for characteristics that\nwould help the bacteria survive the perilous journey from the mouth to the\nintestine\u2014such as the ability to gain nutrients in hostile environments (such\nas an inflamed gastrointestinal tract) or to better invade cells. These\nmicrobes also have \u201cone of the most potent acid-resistant systems\u201d found in\nbacteria, which lets them tolerate the stomach\u2019s acidic environment, explains\nChristopher Johnston, a geneticist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and co-\nsenior author of the study.\n\n## Curated by Our Editors\n\n  * ### New Cancer Vaccines Could Treat Some Types of Pancreatic, Colorectal and Other Deadly Forms of the Disease\n\nJaimie Seaton\n\n  * ### Fungi Lurk Inside Cancers--And Might Speed Their Growth\n\nMax Kozlov & Nature magazine\n\n  * ### The Colon Cancer Conundrum\n\nCassandra Willyard\n\n  * ### Colon Cancer Screening Guidelines May Need Revising\n\nHeather Stringer\n\nThe findings suggested that the microbes in the second clade were more\nstrongly associated with colon cancer, leading the researchers to explore\nfurther how these microbes interacted with the intestine in a mouse model.\nThey gave one group of mice a single oral dose of F. nucleatum animalis from\nclade 1 and another a dose of clade 2 and then counted the number of tumors\nthat formed. Mice in the clade 2 group developed a significantly higher number\nof large intestinal tumors in comparison with those given clade 1 bacteria or\na nonbacterial control.\n\nWhen the scientists measured metabolic molecules inside tumors from the mice\nwith clade 2 bacteria, they found more molecules associated with cellular\ndamage from oxidative stress, cancer cell division and inflammation than mice\nin the control and clade 1 bacteria groups. \u201cThis supports the idea that clade\n2 bacteria are contributing to this proinflammatory, pro-oncogenic\nenvironment,\u201d Zepeda-Rivera says.\n\nIdentifying the F. nucleatum variant linked to colon cancer provides helpful\ninsight into its role in disease development, says Shuji Ogino, a Harvard\nMedical School pathologist, who was not involved with the new study. He notes,\nthough, that more evidence from a larger group of people with colon cancer is\nneeded, as well as more research to see how exactly the bacteria might\ncontribute to inflammation and cancer progression.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings might also help in the search for a low-cost, noninvasive\nstrategy to identify people at higher risk for colon cancer, says Cynthia\nSears, a biologist at Johns Hopkins University, who peer-reviewed the study.\n\u201cWe need an approach that enables us to zero in on people with higher risk,\u201d\nshe adds. Sears says a test could be developed to simply screen for the\npresence of this bacteria with a mouth swab or stool sample; clade 2 bacteria\nwere found to be more prevalent in fecal samples from those with colon cancer,\ntoo.\n\nIn addition to diagnostic tools to predict cancer progression, Bullman,\nJohnston and Zepeda-Rivera also envision developing a vaccine against the F.\nnucleatum animalis in clade 2. This approach would be similar to that used\nwith the human papillomavirus vaccine, which targets specific virus subtypes\nthat are most linked to disease.\n\nThe study authors say the new findings are an exciting and important step in\nlearning how these microbes can be leveraged to tackle colon cancer. \u201cThese\nresults are like a roadmap since we\u2019ve identified the specific clade in\ntumors,\u201d Johnston says. \u201cAnd now we\u2019ve outlined the differences that can be\ninvestigated moving forward.\u201d\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nMaggie Chen is a science journalist and M.D./Ph.D. candidate at Stanford\nUniversity.\n\nMore by Maggie Chen\n\n# Popular Stories\n\nSpace Exploration April 12, 2024\n\n##\n\nSuspected Space-Junk Strike in Florida Signals New Era of Orbital Debris\n\nThree years ago astronauts threw out the largest piece of trash ever tossed\nfrom the International Space Station.
