Farquhar, computer security professional, train hobbyist, and\nlandlord\n\nHome \u00bb Retro Computing \u00bb Steve Jobs and the Amiga\n\n# Steve Jobs and the Amiga\n\nDave Farquhar Retro Computing August 29, 2016July 13, 20171980s, amiga, amiga\nos, apple, commodore, Commodore Amiga, macintosh, os 2, Steve Jobs, Steve\nWozniak\n\nLast Updated on July 13, 2017 by Dave Farquhar\n\nSteve Jobs was aware of the Amiga. He didn\u2019t think much of it. Even still,\nSteve Jobs and the Amiga did have some connections.\n\nJobs\u2019 opinion of the Commodore PET made bigger headlines after he died, but\nJobs had an opinion about the Amiga, too. Both pre- and post-Commodore Amiga.\n\nOverall, Jobs thought the Amiga\u2019s chips were overkill. Brian Bagnall\u2019s book On\nthe Edge: The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore states on page 419 that\nJobs said there was too much hardware in the machine.\n\nPerhaps this wasn\u2019t surprising. He was coming off the design of the original\nMacintosh, which didn\u2019t have color, had limited sound, and he didn\u2019t want the\nRAM to be expandable. Jobs liked closed architectures. The Amiga was closer to\nSteve Wozniak\u2019s design philosophy, except the Amiga engineers designed their\nown chips rather than using off-the-shelf stuff. It had 4,096 colors, 4-voice\nstereo sound capable of playing digital samples, and just about everything\nelse that home computers didn\u2019t have up to that point.\n\nAmiga (the struggling independent company) needed someone to sell to. In 2015,\nAmiga investor and director Bill Hart told the story of Steve Jobs visiting\nAmiga in 1983. Jobs had money, so Amiga was interested in talking to him. Hart\nsaid Jobs came in and made himself at home, putting his feet up on other\npeople\u2019s desks as they demonstrated their technology. But it was a fishing\nexpedition. On the way out, Jobs said, \u201cI don\u2019t see anything here that would\never be a threat to the Macintosh.\u201d\n\nHe was wrong, of course. The Amiga 1000 wasn\u2019t a bestseller but it sold better\nthan the original, crippled 128K Mac. That machine is valuable today because\nso few people bought it. The 128K Mac didn\u2019t have as much hardware in it, and\ndidn\u2019t have any facility to add more.\n\nApple fired Jobs in the spring of 1985, before the Amiga 1000 even hit the\nmarket. Once it was possible to buy an Amiga, Apple scrambled to catch up,\nadding color, more memory, faster CPUs, better sound, and rudimentary\nmultitasking. It was an uphill battle, but Apple\u2019s leadership was more\ninterested in staying in business than Commodore\u2019s leadership, so they won.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end of Steve Jobs and the Amiga. Jobs indirectly\ninfluenced the Amiga in the late 1980s. Commodore bought some computers from\nNext, Steve Jobs\u2019 new company, for routine evaluation. Some of the Amiga\nengineers got their hands on the big Next monitors. They were monochrome, but\nthey were big, and good for development. The developers modified Amiga OS 2.0\nso it would look really good on those big Next monitors.\n\nOver time, Apple made the Macintosh more and more Amiga-like. But the one\nthing they weren\u2019t able to add themselves was modern, pre-emptive multitasking\nlike the Amiga had since 1985. Apple bought Next to get multitasking. Jobs was\npart of that deal, and you undoubtedly know the rest of that story.\n\nEventually, Jobs even saw the value in computers being able to play digital\nmusic. Amazing.\n\nIf you found this post informative or helpful, please share it!\n\n  * share\n  * save\n  * share\n  * share\n  * share 13\n  * share\n  * pocket\n  * share\n  * email\n  * RSS feed\n\nDave Farquhar\n\nDavid Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.\nHe started his career as a part-time computer technician in 1994, worked his\nway up to system administrator by 1997, and has specialized in vulnerability\nmanagement since 2013.
