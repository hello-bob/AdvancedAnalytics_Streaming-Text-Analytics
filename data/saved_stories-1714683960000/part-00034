First are the\ncharacters: a 64-year-old businessman in love with his wife, a 45-year-old\nbeautiful politician for his wife, and a 24-year-old Buddhist monk the couple\nadopted last year after the wife, who has always been religious, said she felt\nsorry for the young man.\n\nThe incident, which has spread mainly in China through various social media\nchannels, including YouTube, began when Ti started getting suspicious of his\nwife, who would constantly visit the monk's cabin. He would then knock on the\ndoor without getting a reply before his wife would emerge, saying they were\ndeep in prayer after some time.\n\nThai politician in bed, caught monk-ying around with adopted son (Weibo)\n\nOn the day before the scandal, Ti said he had to drive from Bangkok to\nSukhothai, where the couple owned a house, to confirm his suspicions. The rest\nof the scene played out according to the video, with the husband shouting,\n\"Are you two very happy?\"\n\nDespite being caught with their pants down (literally), Prapaporn denied her\nhusband's suspicions and said they were just there to talk because the monk\nwas experiencing problems. She then said they also planned to shower together.\n\n\"I was so angry when I found them together; I feel so betrayed. I had brought\nher gold and given her many gifts,\" said Ti.\n\n## Political Repercussions\n\nPrapaporn's position as a politician has only intensified the scrutiny\nsurrounding the affair, raising questions about ethics, moral conduct, and\nabuse of power. The betrayal of trust and the involvement of a monk, a revered\nfigure in Thai culture, has added complexity to an already scandalous\nnarrative.\n\nThe fallout from the affair has been swift and severe. Prapaporn was suspended\nfrom public office directly, resulting in the scandal. She is known as \"Madam\nPle\" in the political circle and is currently president of Sukhothai's local\nChamber of Commerce. She has also been part of the Democrat Party since 2023.\n\nThe politician and her adopted monk son were \"just talking\" in bed when her\nhusband walked in (Weibo)\n\nMeanwhile, Phra Maha's involvement has sparked outrage and disbelief among the\npublic. As a monk, he is held to a higher standard of moral conduct, making\nhis participation in the affair all the more egregious. The 24-year-old is\nsaid to have escaped after the discovery and is hiding.\n\nMadam Ple, speaking with local media, said that she wasn't having an affair.\n\"We didn't have sex then. Nothing happened; it's not what it looks like in the\nvideo. He had some problems, so we were talking together, and then we were\ngoing to shower.\"\n\nRead more\n\nElon Sorry For Calling Asana CEO 'R*tard': 'I Meant He's a Pompous *diot With\nHead Up His A*s'\n\nVietnam Property Tycoon Faces Verdict In Multi-billion Dollar Fraud Case\n\nJakarta Is Sinking: Indonesia's $30B Plan To Relocate 11M Residents To New\nCapital Starting October 2024\n\nThailand\n\n\u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2024.
