To foster its uptake by industry,\nCERN has launched the White Rabbit Collaboration\n\n22 March, 2024\n\nThe White Rabbit community gathers to celebrate the launch of the White Rabbit\nCollaboration. (Image: CERN)\n\nWhite Rabbit (WR) is a technology developed at CERN, in collaboration with\ninstitutes and companies, to synchronise devices in the accelerators down to\nsub-nanoseconds and solve the challenge of establishing a common notion of\ntime across a network. Indeed, at a scale of billionths of a second, the time\nlight takes to travel through a fibre-optic cable and the time the electronics\ntake to process the signal are no longer negligible. To avoid potential\ndelays, the co-inventors of White Rabbit designed a new ethernet switch.\n\nFirst used in 2012, the application of this fully open-source technology has\nquickly expanded outside the field of particle physics. In 2020, it was\nincluded in the worldwide industry standard known as Precision Time Protocol\n(PTP), governed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n(IEEE).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, CERN recently launched the White Rabbit Collaboration, a\nmembership-based global community whose objective is to maintain a high-\nperformance open-source technology that meets the needs of users and to\nfacilitate its uptake by industry. The WR Collaboration will provide dedicated\nsupport and training, facilitate R&D projects between entities with common\ninterests and complementary expertise and establish a testing ecosystem\nfostering trust in products that incorporate the open-source technology. At\nCERN, the WR Collaboration Bureau \u2013 a dedicated team composed of senior White\nRabbit engineers and a community coordinator \u2013 will facilitate the day-to-day\nrunning of the Collaboration\u2019s activities and support its members.\n\n\u201cA key distinctive feature of White Rabbit, as opposed to other technologies\nthat have been developed since, is that it is open source and based on\nstandards\u201d, says Javier Serrano, Chair of the White Rabbit Collaboration Board\nand co-inventor of the technology. Companies and institutes can therefore\nadapt it to their needs and incorporate it in their products and systems,\nwhile the technology, in turn, benefits from a large community of developers.\n\u201cThe first step to foster industry uptake was to include WR concepts in the\nIEEE standard. Through this endeavour, we established many links with\nindustry,\u201d says Maciej Lipinski, Chair of the White Rabbit Collaboration\nCouncil and senior White Rabbit engineer at CERN.\n\nWhite Rabbit is used in the finance sector as well as in many research\ninfrastructures, and it is currently being evaluated for application in the\nfuture quantum internet. The technology could also play a key role in the\nfuture landscape of global time dissemination technologies, which currently\nrely heavily on satellites. The infrastructure for the dissemination of time\nis essential to the economy and underpins most critical national\ninfrastructure. Governments and industry across the globe are therefore\nstriving to find alternatives to distribute a reference time, such as the one\nWR could offer via optical fibre, with telecom and power grid companies\nstarting to test WR in their networks.\n\nThe WR Collaboration comes at a moment when many sectors are undergoing a\nprofound transformation with regards to their timing technology. \u201cThe WR\nCollaboration will provide a neutral gathering point around this open-source\ntechnology and define a long-term common vision, establishing a solid ground\nfrom which innovation can thrive,\u201d continues Amanda Diez Fernandez from CERN\u2019s\nKnowledge Transfer group and the White Rabbit Community Coordinator.\n\nTo learn more about how to join the White Rabbit Collaboration, go to:\nwww.white-rabbit.tech\n\n_______\n\nFrom 21\u201322 March, the White Rabbit community met at CERN to celebrate the\nlaunch of the WR Collaboration.
