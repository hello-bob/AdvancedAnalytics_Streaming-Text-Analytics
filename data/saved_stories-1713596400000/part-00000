MetS was defined according\nto the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III\nreport. The MDS is a scoring system developed to predict the status of\nmagnesium deficiency that fully considers the pathophysiological factors\ninfluencing the kidneys' reabsorption capability. Weighted univariate and\nmultivariable logistic regression were used to assess the association between\nMDS and MetS. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted to\ncharacterize dose-response relationships. Stratified analyses by\nsociodemographic and lifestyle factors were also performed.\n\nResults\n\nIn both univariate and multivariable analyses, higher MDS was significantly\nassociated with increased odds of MetS. Each unit increase in MDS was\nassociated with approximately a 30% higher risk for MetS, even after adjusting\nfor confounding factors (odds ratio 1.31; 95% CI, 1.17-1.45). RCS graphs\ndepicted a linear dose-response relationship across the MDS range. This\npositive correlation remained consistent across various population subgroups\nand exhibited no significant interaction by age, sex, race, adiposity, smoking\nstatus, or alcohol consumption.\n\nConclusion\n\nHigher urinary magnesium loss as quantified by MDS may be an independent\nlinear risk factor for MetS in US adults, irrespective of sociodemographic and\nbehavioral factors. Optimizing magnesium nutritional status could potentially\nconfer benefits to patients with MetS.\n\nmagnesium, magnesium depletion score (MDS), metabolic syndrome (MetS), NHANES,\nnutritional epidemiology\n\nIssue Section:\n\nClinical Research Article\n\nMetabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common metabolic disorder caused by the\nincreasing prevalence of obesity, and currently, this disorder is defined in\nvarious ways. In the 1980s, Reaven clustered the risk factors for diabetes and\ncardiovascular diseases together and called it \u201csyndrome X,\u201d which includes\ninsulin resistance, hypertension, hyperglycemia, low high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (HDL-c), and high triglycerides (TGs) (1). Insulin resistance is\ndefined clinically as the inability of a known quantity of exogenous or\nendogenous insulin to increase glucose uptake and utilization in an individual\nas much as it does in a normal population (2). In 1992, after central obesity\nwas added as a core component of the definition and entity, it was renamed\ninsulin resistance syndrome (IRS) (3). In 1998, The World Health Organization\nuniformly named it \u201cmetabolic syndrome\u201d (MetS) and proposed that insulin\nresistance is the core of the pathophysiology of MetS (4). In the following\nyears, the definitions of MetS revised according to the racial conditions of\nother countries also appeared, among which the more influential ones include\nthe definition of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment\nPanel III Criteria (NCEP-ATP III) (5) and the definition of the International\nDiabetes Federation. According to the NCEP ATP III definition, MetS is\ndiagnosed as the presence of at least 3 of the following 5 characteristics:\nhigh waist circumference, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar level,\nincreased TGs, and low HDL-c (5). MetS is important because of its association\nwith an increasing prevalence of diabetes and a higher risk of cardiovascular\nevents such as heart disease and stroke, which have become a major public\nhealth challenge.\n\nMagnesium is a vital mineral in the human body, serving as an essential\ncofactor for hundreds of enzymatic reactions. These include energy metabolism,\nprotein and nucleic acid synthesis, and the secretion and action of insulin\n(6, 7). It plays a crucial role in maintaining normal nerve and muscle\nfunction, supporting a healthy immune system, and ensuring a steady heartbeat.\nDespite its importance, magnesium deficiency is a widespread and often\noverlooked public health issue. More than half of the US population fails to\nmeet the recommended dietary allowance for magnesium intake, leading to a high\nestimated prevalence (\u223c15%) of magnesium deficiency (8). Studies have found\nthat hypomagnesemia is associated with elevated risk and adverse prognosis in\npatients with diabetes, stroke, and coronary artery disease. Increasing\nmagnesium intake can reduce the risk of diabetes, stroke and hypertension (9,\n10).\n\nAlthough serum magnesium is frequently used in clinical settings to assess\nmagnesium deficiency (11), it may not accurately reflect the body's overall\nmagnesium status. This is largely due to the kidneys\u2019 role in absorbing more\nthan 80% of plasma magnesium, a process vital for maintaining magnesium\nhomeostasis. In light of this, Fan et al (12) developed the magnesium\ndepletion score (MDS), a composite score that aggregates 4 established risk\nfactors and also takes into account the pathophysiological factors influencing\nthe kidneys\u2019 reabsorption capability. A higher MDS indicates a more severe\nstate of magnesium deficiency. However, to our knowledge, the association\nbetween the MDS and MetS has not been studied. It may therefore be helpful to\nfurther explore the relationship between MDS and MetS to develop future\nprevention or treatment methods for this disease. We investigated the\nassociation between MDS and MetS by examining 80 312 participants from the\nNHANES from 2003 to 2018.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Study Population and Design\n\nData for this study were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). In\nthis study, 9 cycles of NHANES data (2003-2018) were collected by the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention. NHANES is a multistage, stratified, large,\nnationally representative study of the US population that provides detailed\ninformation about the study design, interviews, demographics, etc (13-15).\nAmong the sample of 80 312 adults, those who did not provide MDS information\nor other variables were excluded (Fig. 1). Protocol approval was granted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 ethical review board, and informed\nconsent forms were signed by participants.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nFlowchart of participant selection from National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey 2003 to 2018.\n\n### Calculation of the Magnesium Depletion Score\n\nThe MDS was calculated to evaluate total-body magnesium status. The MDS was\ncalculated as the sum of the following 4 scores: (1) current use of diuretics\nwas scored 1 point; (2) current use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was scored\n1 point; (3) an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 60\nmL/min/1.73 m^2 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 was scored 1 point, while an eGFR less\nthan 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 was scored 2 points; and (4) heavy drinking (>1\ndrink/d for women and >2 drinks/d for men) was scored 1 point (12). The eGFR\nwas calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration\nformula (16). According to the Food Patterns Equivalents Database, alcoholic\ndrinks include all types of beers, wines, distilled spirits (such as brandy,\ngin, rum, vodka, and whiskey), cordials, and liqueurs. One drink was defined\nas the amount of alcoholic beverage containing 0.6 fluid ounces or 14 g of\nethanol. MDS was categorized into 6 groups: MDS = 0, MDS = 1, MDS = 2, MDS =\n3, MDS = 4, and MDS = 5.\n\n### Diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome\n\nMetS was defined according to the NCEP-ATP III report (5). Participants were\ndiagnosed with MetS if they met at least 3 of the following 5 criteria: (1)\ncentral obesity: waist circumference greater than or equal to 102 cm in men,\nor greater than or equal to 88 cm in women; (2) hypertriglyceridemia: serum\nTGs greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL; (3) low HDL-c: serum HDL-c less than\n40 mg/dL in men and less than 50 mg/dL in women; (4) hypertension: systolic\nblood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 130 mm Hg, or diastolic blood\npressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 85 mm Hg, or receiving\nantihypertensive treatment; (5) hyperglycemia: fasting glucose greater than or\nequal to 100 mg/dL, or receiving antihyperglycemic treatments. Data on waist\ncircumference, body weight, and height were collected using standard\nprocedures during physical examinations. SBP and DBP were calculated as the\narithmetic averages of repeated measures (up to 4 times) for each participant.\nTGs and HDL-c were measured in serum, while fasting glucose was measured in\nplasma.\n\n### Covariates Assessment\n\nNHANES collects some sociodemographic information through structured data. The\nmain covariates in this study were demographic characteristics and chronic\ncomorbidities. Demographic characteristics, including age, sex, race, and\neducation level, were reported by interviewees. Measurements of waist size,\nweight, and height were taken by well-trained health technologists following\nthe anthropometry procedure manual. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as\nweight (kg) divided by height squared (m^2). Currently used clinical criteria\nand guidelines issued by the International Diabetes Association were used to\ndiagnose diabetes, with diabetes classified by either fasting blood glucose\ngreater than or equal to 7.0 mmol/L in laboratory tests, blood glucose greater\nthan 11.1 mmol/L in the oral glucose tolerance test experiment, those taking\ndiabetes medications, those diagnosed with diabetes by their doctors during\nthe survey, and those who self-reported. Hypertension was defined as a mean\nSBP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or DBP greater than or equal to 90 mm\nHg or current use of antihypertensive medication as per self-reported\nquestionnaire. Other chronic comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia were\nidentified either through a doctor's diagnosis or a self-reported\nquestionnaire.\n\n### Statistical Analyses\n\nFor all individuals in the present study, descriptive analyses were performed\non the characteristics of each participant. Statistical analysis was conducted\nusing R open-source software version 4.3.1 to analyze the data for this study.\nData extraction and analyses were performed with the use of the \u201cnhanesR\u201d\npackage of R software(R Core Team; 2023. R: A Language and Environment for\nStatistical Computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing,\nhttps://www.R-project.org/). For continuous variables, the mean and SD were\nreported, while for categorical variables, percentages were reported. For\ncontinuous variables, the baseline characteristics were analyzed using a\nlinear regression model, and for categorical variables, they were analyzed\nusing a chi-square test. Weighted univariate and multivariable logistic\nregression were used to assess the association between MDS and MetS. The\nformulas for multivariable logistic regression were: log(p/(1 \u2212 p)) = \u03b20 +\n\u03b21X1 + \u03b22X2 + ... + \u03b2nXn (where p = probability of MetS, \u03b20 = intercept, \u03b21 to\n\u03b2n = regression coefficients for each predictor variable, X1 to Xn = predictor\nvariables (age, sex, race, etc). Four models were created: a crude model with\nno adjustments for confounding factors; model 1, adjusted for age, sex, race,\nand education level; model 2, adjusted for the variables in model 1 plus BMI,\nwaist, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), TGs, total\ncholesterol (TC), HDL-c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c),\nhomeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycated\nhemoglobin A_1c (HbA_1c), corrected calcium (Ca), smoking, and drinking; and\nmodel 3, adjusted for the variables in model 2 plus hyperlipidemia, diabetes,\nand hypertension. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted to\ncharacterize dose-response relationships. Stratified analyses by\nsociodemographic and lifestyle factors were also performed. We considered all\nsurvey sampling weights when analyzing the data, which were considered\nstatistically significant if P was less than .05.\n\n## Results\n\n### Baseline Characteristics of Study Participants by Metabolic Syndrome\n\nBetween 2003 and 2018, a total of 80 312 participants were involved in NHANES\n(see Fig. 1). Participants who did not provide relevant information for the\ncalculation of MetS, MDS, or other variables were excluded, resulting in a\nfinal sample of 15 565 participants for statistical analysis. Of these, 10 127\ndid not have MetS, while 5438 did. In Table 1, we show the general\ncharacteristics of the study population based on whether they had MetS.\nCompared to individuals without MetS, those with MetS were found to be more\nlikely older, of non-Hispanic white ethnicity, smokers, nondrinkers, and with\na lower education level. They also exhibited higher BMI, waist circumference,\nALT, AST, TGs, TC, LDL-c, and MDS, but lower eGFR. Furthermore, individuals\nwith MetS demonstrated more severe insulin resistance, higher levels of\nHbA_1c, and were more likely to have a history of hyperlipidemia,\nhypertension, and diabetes. MDS was categorized into 6 levels from 0 to 5. The\nproportion of participants with MDS = 0 was lower in the MetS group compared\nto the non-MetS group (32.48% vs 49.41%), while the proportions for MDS\ngreater than or equal to 2 were all higher in the MetS group (all P < .05).\n\nTable 1.\n\nBaseline characteristics of participants with or without metabolic syndrome\n\nCharacters .| Total .| Non\u2013metabolic syndrome .| Metabolic syndrome

The MDS was found\nto be significantly associated with increased odds of MetS. The odds ratio\n(OR) for MDS was 1.78 (95% CI, 1.69-1.88), indicating that every 1-unit\nincrease in MDS was associated with 78% higher odds of having MetS. When MDS\nwas categorized into 6 levels, there was a stepwise increase in the odds of\nMetS with increasing MDS. Using MDS = 0 as reference, the OR (95% CI) was 1.41\n(1.28-1.56) for MDS = 1; 3.12 (2.71-3.59) for MDS = 2; 6.59 (5.28-8.24) for\nMDS = 3; and 9.05 (5.97-13.73) for MDS = 4. The association was statistically\nsignificant for MDS levels ranging from 1 to 4 (all P < .0001). Other factors\nsignificantly associated with higher odds of MetS included older age, non-\nHispanic White race, lower education level, higher BMI, larger waist\ncircumference, elevated levels of ALT, AST, TGs, TC, LDL-c, HOMA-IR, HbA_1c,\nsmoking, no alcohol drinking, and the presence of hyperlipidemia,\nhypertension, and diabetes (all P < .05).\n\nTable 2.\n\nUnivariate logistics regression analysis of the association between magnesium\ndepletion score and metabolic syndrome\n\nCharacter .| OR (95% CI) .| P .  \n---|---|---  \nAge, y| 1.04 (1.04-1.04)| <.0001  \nSex  \nMale| Reference| Reference  \nFemale| 1.10 (1.00-1.21)| .06  \nRace  \nNon-Hispanic White| Reference| Reference  \nNon-Hispanic Black| 0.80 (0.72-0.89)| <.0001  \nMexican American| 0.90 (0.79-1.03)| .12  \nOther Race| 0.75 (0.65-0.85)| <.0001  \nEducation  \n> High school| Reference| Reference  \nHigh school| 1.45 (1.30-1.62)| <.0001  \n< High school| 1.67 (1.42-1.97)| <.0001  \nBMI| 1.19 (1.17-1.20)| <.0001  \nWaist, cm| 1.09 (1.09-1.10)| <.0001  \nMDS| 1.78 (1.69-1.88)| <.0001  \n0| Reference| Reference  \n1| 1.41 (1.28-1.56)| <.0001  \n2| 3.12 (2.71-3.59)| <.0001  \n3| 6.59 (5.28-8.24)| <.0001  \n4| 9.05 (5.97-13.73)| <.0001  \n5| 1.76 (0.32-9.56)| .51  \nALT, U/L| 1.02 (1.01-1.02)| <.0001  \nAST, U/L| 1.01 (1.00-1.01)| .002  \nTGs, mmol/L| 5.42 (4.86-6.04)| <.0001  \nTC, mmol/L| 1.07 (1.02-1.12)| .002  \nHDL-c, mmol/L| 0.08 (0.07-0.10)| <.0001  \nLDL-c, mmol/L| 1.06 (1.01-1.11)| .02  \nHOMA-IR| 1.59 (1.53-1.65)| <.0001  \nHbA_1c, %| 3.82 (3.34-4.37)| <.0001  \nCa, mg/dL| 2.29 (1.96-2.68)| <.0001  \nSmoking  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 1.34 (1.23-1.45)| <.0001  \nDrinking  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 0.82 (0.73-0.92)| <.001  \nHyperlipidemia  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 9.37 (7.80-11.26)| <.0001  \nHypertension  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 6.31 (5.65-7.05)| <.0001  \nDiabetes  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 10.18 (8.92-11.62)| <.0001  \n  \nCharacter .| OR (95% CI) .| P .  \n---|---|---  \nAge, y| 1.04 (1.04-1.04)| <.0001  \nSex  \nMale| Reference| Reference  \nFemale| 1.10 (1.00-1.21)| .06  \nRace  \nNon-Hispanic White| Reference| Reference  \nNon-Hispanic Black| 0.80 (0.72-0.89)| <.0001  \nMexican American| 0.90 (0.79-1.03)| .12  \nOther Race| 0.75 (0.65-0.85)| <.0001  \nEducation  \n> High school| Reference| Reference  \nHigh school| 1.45 (1.30-1.62)| <.0001  \n< High school| 1.67 (1.42-1.97)| <.0001  \nBMI| 1.19 (1.17-1.20)| <.0001  \nWaist, cm| 1.09 (1.09-1.10)| <.0001  \nMDS| 1.78 (1.69-1.88)| <.0001  \n0| Reference| Reference  \n1| 1.41 (1.28-1.56)| <.0001  \n2| 3.12 (2.71-3.59)| <.0001  \n3| 6.59 (5.28-8.24)| <.0001  \n4| 9.05 (5.97-13.73)| <.0001  \n5| 1.76 (0.32-9.56)| .51  \nALT, U/L| 1.02 (1.01-1.02)| <.0001  \nAST, U/L| 1.01 (1.00-1.01)| .002  \nTGs, mmol/L| 5.42 (4.86-6.04)| <.0001  \nTC, mmol/L| 1.07 (1.02-1.12)| .002  \nHDL-c, mmol/L| 0.08 (0.07-0.10)| <.0001  \nLDL-c, mmol/L| 1.06 (1.01-1.11)| .02  \nHOMA-IR| 1.59 (1.53-1.65)| <.0001  \nHbA_1c, %| 3.82 (3.34-4.37)| <.0001  \nCa, mg/dL| 2.29 (1.96-2.68)| <.0001  \nSmoking  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 1.34 (1.23-1.45)| <.0001  \nDrinking  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 0.82 (0.73-0.92)| <.001  \nHyperlipidemia  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 9.37 (7.80-11.26)| <.0001  \nHypertension  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 6.31 (5.65-7.05)| <.0001  \nDiabetes  \nNo| Reference| Reference  \nYes| 10.18 (8.92-11.62)| <.0001  \n  \nBold font indicates the corresponding P values are less than .05, signifying\nstatistical significance.\n\nAbbreviations: ALT, alanine transaminase;

In the crude model\nwithout adjustments, a higher MDS was significantly associated with increased\nodds of MetS. The OR (95% CI) for each 1-unit increase in MDS was 1.78\n(1.69-1.88). When MDS was categorized into 6 levels, there was a graded\nincrease in the odds of MetS with increasing MDS (P for trend <.0001). After\nadjusting for demographics (age, sex, race, and education) in model 1, the\nassociation between MDS and MetS was attenuated but remained significant. The\nOR (95% CI) for each 1-unit increase in MDS was 1.33 (1.25-1.41). The odds\nwere also significantly higher for MDS levels 2 to 4 compared to MDS = 0. With\nfurther adjustments for various cardiometabolic factors in models 2 and 3, the\nassociation between MDS and MetS persisted. In the fully adjusted model 3, the\nOR (95% CI) for each 1-unit increase in MDS was 1.31 (1.17-1.45). MDS levels 1\nto 4 remained significantly associated with higher odds of MetS compared to\nMDS = 0 after full adjustments (all P < .05).\n\nTable 3.\n\nMultivariable logistics regression analysis of the association between\nmagnesium depletion score and metabolic syndrome\n\nCharacter .| Model .  \n---|---  \nCrude model .| Model 1 .| Model 2 .| Model 3 .  \n95% CI .| P .| 95% CI .| P .| 95% CI .| P .| 95% CI .| P .  \nTotal| 1.78 (1.69-1.88)| <.0001| 1.33 (1.25-1.41)| <.0001| 1.51 (1.37-1.67)|\n<.0001| 1.31 (1.17-1.45)| <.0001  \n0| Reference| Reference| Reference| Reference  \n1| 1.41 (1.28-1.56)| <.0001| 1.00 (0.89-1.11)| .96| 1.32 (1.10-1.57)| .003|\n1.28 (1.06-1.55)| .01  \n2| 3.12 (2.71-3.59)| <.0001| 1.60 (1.37-1.87)| <.0001| 2.10 (1.65-2.68)|\n<.0001| 1.57 (1.22-2.03)| <.001  \n3| 6.59 (5.28-8.24)| <.0001| 2.70 (2.09-3.48)| <.0001| 4.19 (2.78-6.33)|\n<.0001| 2.60 (1.69-4.02)| <.0001  \n4| 9.05 (5.97-13.73)| <.0001| 3.49 (2.24-5.44)| <.0001| 4.76 (2.53-8.94)|\n<.0001| 2.83 (1.42-5.61)| .003  \n5| 1.76 (0.32-9.56)| .51| 0.59 (0.10-3.36)| .55| 1.39 (0.12-15.59)| .79| 0.88\n(0.07-11.47)| .92  \nP for trend| <.0001| <.0001| <.0001| <.0001  \n  \nCharacter .| Model .  \n---|---  \nCrude model .| Model 1 .| Model 2 .| Model 3 .  \n95% CI .| P .| 95% CI .| P .| 95% CI .| P .| 95% CI .| P .  \nTotal| 1.78 (1.69-1.88)| <.0001| 1.33 (1.25-1.41)| <.0001| 1.51 (1.37-1.67)|\n<.0001| 1.31 (1.17-1.45)| <.0001  \n0| Reference| Reference| Reference| Reference  \n1| 1.41 (1.28-1.56)| <.0001| 1.00 (0.89-1.11)| .96| 1.32 (1.10-1.57)| .003|\n1.28 (1.06-1.55)| .01  \n2| 3.12 (2.71-3.59)| <.0001| 1.60 (1.37-1.87)| <.0001| 2.10 (1.65-2.68)|\n<.0001| 1.57 (1.22-2.03)| <.001  \n3| 6.59 (5.28-8.24)| <.0001| 2.70 (2.09-3.48)| <.0001| 4.19 (2.78-6.33)|\n<.0001| 2.60 (1.69-4.02)| <.0001  \n4| 9.05 (5.97-13.73)| <.0001| 3.49 (2.24-5.44)| <.0001| 4.76 (2.53-8.94)|\n<.0001| 2.83 (1.42-5.61)| .003  \n5| 1.76 (0.32-9.56)| .51| 0.59 (0.10-3.36)| .55| 1.39 (0.12-15.59)| .79| 0.88\n(0.07-11.47)| .92  \nP for trend| <.0001| <.0001| <.0001| <.0001  \n  \nCrude model: no adjustments made for confounding factors.

MDS was significantly associated with increased odds of MetS in\nmost subgroups, with ORs ranging from 1.19 to 1.60 per 1-unit MDS increase.\nThe association was not significant only in the Mexican American subgroup (P =\n.08). There was no significant interaction detected between MDS and subgroups,\nindicating the positive MDS-MetS relationship was consistent across diverse\npopulation segments. Overall, these findings demonstrate that higher magnesium\ndeficiency status as reflected by MDS is a robust independent risk factor for\nMetS irrespective of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in US adults.\n\nTable 4.\n\nSubgroup analysis for the association between magnesium depletion score and\nmetabolic syndrome\n\nCharacter .| OR (95% CI) .| P .| P for interaction .  \n---|---|---|---  \nAge, y| .33  \n<40| 1.26 (1.01-1.58)| .04  \n40-60| 1.28 (1.09-1.51)| .003  \n>60| 1.33 (1.18-1.51)| <.0001  \nSex| .46  \nMale| 1.60 (1.40-1.83)| <.0001  \nFemale| 1.48 (1.30-1.69)| <.0001  \nRace| .27  \nNon-Hispanic White| 1.51 (1.34-1.70)| <.0001  \nNon-Hispanic Black| 1.38 (1.22-1.56)| <.0001  \nMexican American| 1.19 (0.98-1.46)| .08  \nOther race| 1.37 (1.13-1.65)| .001  \nBMI| .92  \nNormal| 1.33 (1.02-1.74)| .03  \nUnnormal| 1.50 (1.36-1.64)| <.0001  \nDrinking| .27  \nNo| 1.43 (1.19-1.73)| <.001  \nYes| 1.50 (1.37-1.64)| <.0001  \nSmoking| .75  \nNo| 1.57 (1.38-1.78)| <.0001  \nYes| 1.42 (1.26-1.60)| <.0001  \n  \nCharacter .| OR (95% CI) .| P .| P for interaction .  \n---|---|---|---  \nAge, y| .33  \n<40| 1.26 (1.01-1.58)| .04  \n40-60| 1.28 (1.09-1.51)| .003  \n>60| 1.33 (1.18-1.51)| <.0001  \nSex| .46  \nMale| 1.60 (1.40-1.83)| <.0001  \nFemale| 1.48 (1.30-1.69)| <.0001  \nRace| .27  \nNon-Hispanic White| 1.51 (1.34-1.70)| <.0001  \nNon-Hispanic Black| 1.38 (1.22-1.56)| <.0001  \nMexican American| 1.19 (0.98-1.46)| .08  \nOther race| 1.37 (1.13-1.65)| .001  \nBMI| .92  \nNormal| 1.33 (1.02-1.74)| .03  \nUnnormal| 1.50 (1.36-1.64)| <.0001  \nDrinking| .27  \nNo| 1.43 (1.19-1.73)| <.001  \nYes| 1.50 (1.37-1.64)| <.0001  \nSmoking| .75  \nNo| 1.57 (1.38-1.78)| <.0001  \nYes| 1.42 (1.26-1.60)| <.0001  \n  \nSubgroup analysis for the association between MDS and MetS.

The OR increased steadily with higher MDS up to a level\nof around 4, where the OR peaked. Beyond MDS of 4, the OR plateaued and\nslightly declined with further increases in MDS. The P value for a nonlinear\nrelationship was greater than .05, indicating there was no statistically\nsignificant evidence of nonlinearity between MDS and MetS odds. Although the\nOR appeared to peak at MDS of 4, the overall relationship can be considered\nlinear given the nonsignificant test for nonlinearity. In summary, this figure\ndemonstrates an approximately linear-positive association between higher MDS\nand increased odds of MetS, without clear threshold effects.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nNonlinear associations between magnesium depletion score (MDS) and risk of\nmetabolic syndrome (MetS).

We found that higher MDS, indicative of\ngreater urinary magnesium loss, was independently associated with increased\nlikelihood of MetS. We observed a graded dose-response relationship between\nMDS and the odds of MetS, with no evidence of a threshold effect. The positive\ncorrelation between MDS and MetS remained significant even after adjusting for\npotential sociodemographic, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic confounders. This\nassociation was consistently observed across various subgroups defined by age,\nsex, race, BMI, drinking status, and smoking status.\n\nMetS is a constellation of multiple risk factors, including insulin\nresistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and adiposity (17). Magnesium is an\nessential nutrient for maintaining vital physiological functions. Numerous\nstudies have investigated the relationship between MetS and magnesium. An\nincreasing body of evidence suggests that chronic hypomagnesemia may play a\nrole in the pathogenesis of various metabolic disorders, including overweight\nand obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension,\nalterations in lipid metabolism, and low-grade inflammation (18-20). A\nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial show that oral\nmagnesium supplementation improves incident MetS with a significant reduction\nin high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia (21). In\nconclusion, magnesium plays a substantial role in MetS occurrence and\ndevelopment.\n\nSerum magnesium is the most commonly used approach to evaluate magnesium\nstatus in clinical practice. However, it does not accurately reflect the\ntotal-body magnesium levels. The serum magnesium level is typically within the\nnormal reference range, especially in the case of chronic magnesium deficiency\n(22, 23). The serum contains 0.3% of the body's total magnesium, and the rest\nis primarily stored in bones, muscles, and soft tissue (24). Both urinary\nmagnesium levels and the fractional excretion of magnesium (FEMg) serve as\nmethods for assessing magnesium status. The FEMg is calculated using the\nconcentrations of magnesium and creatinine both in serum and urine, and can\nserve as a useful tool in assessing magnesium status (25). However, both\nurinary magnesium and FEMg are easily influenced by various factors such as\nrenal function and dietary intake (26). The magnesium tolerance test is\nregarded as a gold standard for evaluating the magnesium status of the body,\nbut it is impractical and difficult to apply broadly since it requires a first\n24-hour urine collection, intravenous magnesium infusion, and then a second\n24-hour urine collection (27, 28). The oral magnesium loading test is another\nmethod for assessing magnesium deficiency. This noninvasive procedure merely\nrequires the oral intake of magnesium and urine collection. However, it\nnecessitates the collection of urine over a specific duration, typically 24\nhours, which can pose an inconvenience for the patient. This factor may\nrestrict its utilization in routine clinical practice (29). Although intense\nresearch activities have been dedicated to magnesium, the difficulties of\naccessing total-body magnesium, and its main 2 compartments, namely bone and\nmuscle, mean that today there is still no simple, rapid, and accurate\nlaboratory test to indicate total-body magnesium status in humans (28). The\nMDS has been demonstrated as a good indicator for predicting magnesium\ndeficiency validated by a magnesium tolerance test (12). It is a simple and\neasy tool to evaluate magnesium deficiency. This implies that the\nincorporation of MDS with other methods for assessing magnesium status could\npotentially enhance our ability to effectively identify individuals with\nmagnesium deficiency.\n\nThe MDS combines 4 risk factors affecting magnesium reabsorption in the US\npopulation, including alcohol consumption, diuretics, PPI, and kidney function\n(12). For instance, alcohol consumption causes a prompt increase in the\nurinary excretion of magnesium (30). Similarly, diuretics can enhance\nmagnesium excretion (31). The administration of a PPI has been shown to reduce\nkidney reabsorption of magnesium by downregulating TRPM6 activity (32). In\naddition to alcohol and medication use, magnesium reabsorption in the kidney\ncan be drastically altered under certain pathophysiological conditions.\nChronic kidney disease is accompanied by increased renal magnesium-wasting\n(33) and, thus, impaired kidney function has been recognized as an essential\npathway underlying magnesium depletion from the urine. Overall, these factors\ncontribute to the utility of MDS as a comprehensive measurement tool for\nevaluating the status of magnesium.\n\nTo our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the association\nbetween magnesium deficiency, assessed using an easy-to-use tool like the MDS,\nand MetS.\n\nIn this study, we discovered a positive association between the MDS, a newly\ndeveloped assessment metric for magnesium status, and MetS. Our findings are\nsupported by some clinical research. A systematic review and meta-analysis\nevaluated the theory that a higher magnesium intake is associated with a lower\nrisk of MetS (9 articles, n = 31 876, OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.86; P < .001)\n(34). Other evidence suggests that dietary magnesium has beneficial effects,\nincluding regulating systemic inflammation (35) and hypertension (36),\nregulating lipids (37), glucose and insulin metabolism, improving insulin\nsensitivity (38), and reducing the risk of diabetes (39). However, data\nregarding the association between magnesium status and MetS are conflicting.\nSome studies concluded that serum magnesium levels are lower in patients with\nMetS compared with their controls (40), whereas other studies reported a\nnonsignificant association (41) or even proposed that there may be a positive\nassociation between serum magnesium concentration and MetS (42). In\nhypertension, a similar situation exists. A systematic review and meta-\nanalysis of prospective cohort studies found an inverse association between\ndietary magnesium intake and the risk of hypertension comparing the highest\nintake group with the lowest. However, the association of serum magnesium\nconcentration with the risk of hypertension was marginally significant (36).\nThis may be because serum magnesium cannot reflect the actual status of whole-\nbody magnesium levels. Therefore, it is very important to find an indicator of\nthe supplement of serum magnesium, to better reflect the status of magnesium\nlevels in the body.\n\nThis study sheds light on the issue of magnesium deficiency and uncovers a\npositive correlation between MDS and the risk of MetS. The results imply that\nwe need to be vigilant about MetS risk, especially for patients with a higher\nMDS. This allows us to identify individuals in the community who may be in a\nmagnesium-deficient state through the use of MDS and other assessment methods,\nand provide magnesium supplementation to these populations to reduce the\nincidence of MetS.\n\nOur study has several advantages. This is the first large, national study to\ninvestigate the association between MDS and MetS based on the well-designed\nNHNAES data. It is worth noting that the analysis incorporates the use of\nsampling weights assigned to each participant. These weights play a crucial\nrole in enabling statistical inferences and generalizing our findings to a\nlarger population beyond the sample size of MetS cases. By accounting for\nthese weights, our study ensures reliable conclusions and precise statistical\npower. In addition, a stratified subgroup analysis was conducted to further\ninvestigate the relationship between MDS and MetS across different population\ngroups, which suggests that we need to implement more precise prevention\nstrategies for MetS. Furthermore, MDS rather than serum magnesium was used in\nour study, which is more reflective of the physiological state of magnesium.\n\nThis study also has some limitations that need to be clarified. First, we\nobserved that there is a nonsignificant association between MDS and Mets when\nMDS = 5. This may be attributable to the small number of participants with MDS\n= 5, which totaled only 6 individuals. Second, we did not evaluate whether MDS\nwas a \u201cbetter\u201d indicator of magnesium deficiency compared to serum magnesium\nlevels because of the lack of serum magnesium in NHANES. Furthermore, the\ncross-sectional study design cannot definitively determine causation between\nMDS and MetS. It is also worth noting that MDS is a categorical variable, not\na continuous variable. In addition, while MDS includes PPI and diuretics,\nother drugs such as tetracyclines, bisphosphonates, \u03b2-adrenergic agonists,\ninsulin, etc, which can affect magnesium levels (31), are not accounted for in\nMDS. Last, although several covariates were adjusted to investigate the\nassociation between MDS and MetS, potential confounders that might have\neffects on the results were not included.\n\nIn conclusion, our study identified a significant association between MDS and\nMetS, and further explored differences across various subgroups. In addition\nto having major implications for clinical practice, our findings have\nimportant public health implications as well.
