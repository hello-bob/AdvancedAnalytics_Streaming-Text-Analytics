Their work could lead to improved efficiency in solar\nelectric systems, semiconductor lasers and other advanced optoelectronic\ntechnologies. Credit: Lucas Van Wyk Joel / UC Irvine\n\nA research team headed by chemists at the University of California, Irvine has\ndiscovered a previously unknown way in which light interacts with matter, a\nfinding that could lead to improved solar power systems, light-emitting\ndiodes, semiconductor lasers and other technological advancements.\n\nIn a paper published recently in the journal ACS Nano, the scientists, joined\nby colleagues at Russia's Kazan Federal University, explain how they learned\nthat photons can obtain substantial momentum, similar to that of electrons in\nsolid materials, when confined to nanometer-scale spaces in silicon.\n\n\"Silicon is Earth's second-most abundant element, and it forms the backbone of\nmodern electronics. However, being an indirect semiconductor, its utilization\nin optoelectronics has been hindered by poor optical properties,\" said senior\nauthor Dmitry Fishman, UC Irvine adjunct professor of chemistry.\n\nHe said that while silicon does not naturally emit light in its bulk form,\nporous and nanostructured silicon can produce detectable light after being\nexposed to visible radiation. Scientists have been aware of this phenomenon\nfor decades, but the precise origins of the illumination have been the subject\nof debate.\n\n\"In 1923, Arthur Compton discovered that gamma photons possessed sufficient\nmomentum to strongly interact with free or bound electrons. This helped prove\nthat light had both wave and particle properties, a finding that led to\nCompton receiving the Nobel Prize in physics in 1927,\" Fishman said.\n\n\"In our experiments, we showed that the momentum of visible light confined to\nnanoscale silicon crystals produces a similar optical interaction in\nsemiconductors.\"\n\nAn understanding of the origin of the interaction requires another trip back\nto the early 20th century. In 1928, Indian physicist C.V. Raman, who won the\n1930 Nobel Prize in physics, attempted to repeat the Compton experiment with\nvisible light. However, he encountered a formidable obstacle in the\nsubstantial disparity between the momentum of electrons and that of visible\nphotons.\n\nGraphical abstract. Credit: ACS Nano (2024). DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.3c12666\n\nDespite this setback, Raman's investigations into inelastic scattering in\nliquids and gases led to the revelation of what is now recognized as the\nvibrational Raman effect, and spectroscopy\u2014a crucial method of spectroscopic\nstudies of matter\u2014has come to be known as Raman scattering.\n\n\"Our discovery of photon momentum in disordered silicon is due to a form of\nelectronic Raman scattering,\" said co-author Eric Potma, UC Irvine professor\nof chemistry. \"But unlike conventional vibrational Raman, electronic Raman\ninvolves different initial and final states for the electron, a phenomenon\npreviously only observed in metals.\"\n\nFor their experiments, the researchers produced in their laboratory silicon\nglass samples that ranged in clarity from amorphous to crystal. They subjected\na 300-nanometer-thick silicon film to a tightly focused continuous-wave laser\nbeam that was scanned to write an array of straight lines.\n\nIn areas where the temperature did not exceed 500 degrees Celsius, the\nprocedure resulted in the formation of a homogenous cross-linked glass. In\nareas where the temperature exceeded 500 C, a heterogeneous semiconductor\nglass was formed. This \"light-foamed film\" allowed the researchers to observe\nhow electronic, optical and thermal properties varied on the nanometer scale.\n\n\"This work challenges our understanding of light and matter interaction,\nunderscoring the critical role of photon momenta,\" Fishman said.\n\n\"In disordered systems, electron-photon momentum matching amplifies\ninteraction\u2014an aspect previously associated only with high-\nenergy\u2014gamma\u2014photons in classical Compton scattering. Ultimately, our research\npaves the way to broaden conventional optical spectroscopies beyond their\ntypical applications in chemical analysis, such as traditional vibrational\nRaman spectroscopy into the realm of structural studies\u2014the information that\nshould be intimately linked with photon momentum.\"\n\nPotma added, \"This newly realized property of light no doubt will open a new\nrealm of applications in optoelectronics. The phenomenon will boost the\nefficiency of solar energy conversion devices and light-emitting materials,\nincluding materials that were previously considered not suitable for light\nemission.\"\n\nMore information: Sergey S.
