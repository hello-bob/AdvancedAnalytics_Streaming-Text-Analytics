Instagram Reels and the Reddit homepage were\nmy personal Achilles heels, though it changed over the years. Before I get to\nthe solution I want to motivate why I think this is actually quite a hard\nproblem.\n\nThe biggest issue is that the different social media companies aren\u2019t stupid.\nThey know the endless content scrolls aren\u2019t why most people come to their\nwebsites. People usually get to Reddit by looking for the answer to a specific\nquestion from Google Search. People usually log on to Instagram to see what\ntheir friends are up to. So they are engineered to make sure you can\u2019t have\none without the other - you click on a Reddit product review through Google,\nand an engaging \u2018related\u2019 post appears right below it, and you\u2019re trapped.\nSimilarly, YouTube hides shorts like landmines between all of the normal\nvideos you might actually proactively decide to watch.\n\nThere are plenty of extensions for the desktop browsers - YouTube Focus, News\nFeed Eradicator (the best one imo), etcetera, that let you take back control\non PC. But then then the Reddits and Instagrams of the world get you on\nmobile. And this is the real issue - mobile apps lock you into an unmodifiable\nexperience meant to addict you, and the companies do their best to make sure\nthere are no alternative apps, with any alternative app being a temporary\nsolution until it is sued or the API priced is hiked to infinity (Ahem,\nReddit) and they are forced to close again. You can use AppBlock to limit\ntime, but there isn\u2019t some set amount of time you need to use the apps. What\nif someone messages you on Instagram? Or you\u2019re looking for an answer to a\nspecific question on Reddit, and your daily limit isn\u2019t enough?\n\nFor a while, I thought the only solution was to wait for proper augmented\nreality glasses to exist. To filter out ads and block feeds closer to the\neyes, where the social media companies can\u2019t find a spot to squeeze in and\nplace some more engaging content. But then I decided to stop being defeatist\nand to dedicate the time to solving this problem. And I found a pretty simple\n(okay maybe not that simple, if you are not technically inclined) solution. A\nmobile browser with add-ons.\n\n##\n\nThe Solution\n\nI personally use Iceraven, but since it\u2019s just a fork of the more well-known\nFirefox, I\u2019ll use the name Firefox. So Firefox, at least on Android, has a few\nextensions. Not the ones I mentioned above that are specifically made to block\nfeeds, so what does it help? UBlock Origin custom filters. Firefox does let\nyou download UBlock Origin. And UBlock Origin, even on mobile, has the\nincredibly customizable \u201cMy filters\u201d, which lets you permanently block web\nelements according to some arbitrary rule on some website. And that\u2019s it. I\ncan use Reddit, but the homepage is blank. I can use Instagram, but UBlock has\n\u2018block large media elements\u2019 which makes reels stop working. For most specific\ncases you might want to remove, someone posted a filter for it online, and if\nyou need something unique to you (for instance, I wanted to hide the Stack\nExchange homepage\u2019s recommendations), figuring out the filter system is pretty\nsimple. And then you just delete all the apps and use your new desktop-level\ncustomizability browser.\n\nFor example this filter blocks the Reddit homepage:\n\n    \n    \n    reddit.com##:matches-path(/^/$/).ListingLayout-outerContainer,#main-content\n\nAnd this one blocks the stack exchange network links:\n\n    \n    \n    stackexchange.com###mainArea\n\nInitially, I was worried I would just find something else to be addicted to,\nlike after I managed to block all the feeds on my PC, I started scrolling on\nmy phone. But there is nothing else. It\u2019s been a few months now, and it just\nworks, all my filters still work, and the most used app on my phone switched\nover from Instagram to Kindle. So I thought I\u2019d share the solution, even\nthough a part of me is worried that they\u2019ll find a way to block it. But\nhonestly, it\u2019s sufficiently contrived that I don\u2019t think enough people could\never do this to ever impact the social media companies, so maybe they\u2019ll let\nit be.\n\nThanks for reading Ivy\u2019s Substack!
