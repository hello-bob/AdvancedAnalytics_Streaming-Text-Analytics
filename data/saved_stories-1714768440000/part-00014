Those dropped as\nVCSP members were instead offered the chance to acquire white label services\nfrom remaining participants in the program, with a tight deadline to sort out\nthose new arrangements.\n\nIn mid-April, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan promised an extended period of \"modified\nmonthly billing arrangements until the white label offers are available.\"\n\nNow VMware's veep for partners and advanced solutions sales, Ahmar Mohammad,\nhas offered more detail on the arrangements.\n\nHis post reveals that all existing VCSP premier tier members will retain that\nstatus, and that special exemptions may be granted to \"partners not yet signed\nup for the program and that may have unique regulatory constraints or country\nspecific sovereign data requirements (example: European Economic Area and\nUnited Kingdom).\"\n\nThat sounds a lot like a concession to Eurocloud lobby CISPE, which has\nstrongly criticized Broadcom and called for a European Commission probe into\nthe acquisitive giant's takeover of VMware.\n\nAnother big change sees partners that exited the VCSP program allowed to\ncontinue operating their cloud services until the end of April 2025. Such\npartners \u2013 some of whom did not choose to exit the program but were shown the\ndoor \u2013 previously faced the prospect of immediately closing their clouds\nand/or signing up to resell white label services.\n\nThe sudden migrations necessitated by that change were obviously not easily\nachieved. Now cloud providers that quit VMware \u2013 and their customers \u2013 have a\nyear to sort things out.\n\n  * VMware\u2019s end-user compute community told to brace for \u2018Omnissa\u2019 shift\n  * Euro cloud group blasts Broadcom over VMware licensing maneuvers\n  * OpenStack pushes its first easy-to-upgrade release out the door\n  * XenServer is back, with a rebranded Citrix Hypervisor and a tasty three-host freebie\n\nAnother change means VCSP partners have an extra month to seek an exemption\nthat will let them continue in the program, or sign up for white label\nservices from another partner. That's not a huge amount of extra time but,\nagain, will offer some relief to what was previously a very short deadline to\nmake changes. Some new classes of partners are also allowed to become white\nlabel providers.\n\n### Losing the biggest cloud of all\n\nOther VMware customers, however, have a new partner-related issue to worry\nabout. Rumors are circulating that Amazon Web Services' VMware service is\ngoing away.\n\nMultiple social media posts from recent days indicate that VMware Cloud on AWS\nwill be discontinued. The change will mean sales cease as of May 1, but the\nservice will remain available.\n\nVMware Cloud on AWS saw the two brands jointly engineer a solution that saw\nVMware's stack run in the AWS cloud as a managed service. The service allowed\nconstruction of hybrid clouds, or could run the vStack as a pure-play cloud\nservice.\n\nAt launch, VMware enthused about its presence in the world's dominant cloud\nand cited AWS's interest in running the service as recognition of its tech as\na foundation for hybrid clouds.\n\nThe Register is aware that the service had its problems as hosts may have been\na little underpowered. Even so, VMC on AWS remained VMware's trophy.\n\nIf it is indeed going to end, VMware has a lot of explaining to do.\n\nTwo other factors need to be considered here. One is that Broadcom and Google\nrecently became BFFs. The former announced it was \"moving the company's VMware\nworkloads to Google Cloud \u2013 including customer-facing products and services as\nwell as internal services.\"\n\nThis shift may have left little room for VMC on AWS to survive.\n\nThe other is that VMC on AWS isn't based on VMware Cloud Foundation, the\nbundle of products that Broadcom has made its lead offering.\n\nWe've asked VMware for comment and were told it had \"nothing to report.\" AWS\nhasn't responded to our queries at the time of writing. You know the drill \u2013\nif we hear something, we'll write more stuff. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AWS\n  * Broadcom\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AWS\n  * Broadcom\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n  * VMWare\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * EC2\n  * ESXi\n  * S3\n  * Tanzu\n  * vSphere\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Amazon\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Jeff Bezos\n  * Network\n  * Semiconductor\n\n#### More about\n\n15 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AWS\n  * Broadcom\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AWS\n  * Broadcom\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n  * VMWare\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * EC2\n  * ESXi\n  * S3\n  * Tanzu\n  * vSphere\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Amazon\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Jeff Bezos\n  * Network\n  * Semiconductor\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Euro cloud group blasts Broadcom over VMware licensing maneuvers\n\nUpdated CISPE says concessions 'solve nothing'\n\nVirtualization9 days | 1\n\n#### Broadcom throws VMware customers on perpetual licenses a lifeline\n\nMeanwhile, Gartner predicts massive market share loss and European regulators\nstart asking questions\n\nVirtualization17 days | 15\n\n#### VMware\u2019s end-user compute community told to brace for \u2018Omnissa\u2019 shift\n\nCloudy hosts given short license change deadlines, customers warned of support\nportal brownouts\n\nVirtualization7 days | 6\n\n#### Easing the cloud migration journey\n\nHuawei\u2019s Net5.5G converged IP network can improve cloud performance,\nreliability and security, says the company\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### AWS hits $100B revenue run rate, expands margins, delivers most of\nAmazon's profit\n\nGrowth is rather slower than cloudy rivals, but boss Andy Jassy can explain\nthat\n\nOff-Prem2 days | 3\n\n#### VMware's end-user compute products probably have a new brand: Omnissa\n\nAs the rest of Virtizilla's users face a pause in support and education\nservices due to apparent SAP-to-Oracle migration\n\nVirtualization21 days | 13\n\n#### AWS customer faces staggering charges over S3 bucket misfire\n\nOpen source tool fingered for 100 million PUT requests and $1,300 in a day\n\nStorage2 days | 54\n\n#### Amazon to ditch WorkDocs sharing service, support countdown begins\n\nUpdated Cloud giant directs users to pack their bags for DropBox, gives them a\nyear to get affairs in order\n\nApplications7 days | 8\n\n#### VMware customer reaction to Broadcom may set the future of software\nlicensing\n\nOpinion Enterprise tech slingers want to see what Hock Tan can get away with \u2013\nand replicate it\n\nVirtualization28 days | 24\n\n#### Amazon to blow $11B on cluster of Indiana bit barns\n\nTalk about going round the (South) Bend\n\nPaaS + IaaS8 days | 4\n\n#### VMware by Broadcom plots pair of Cloud Foundation releases that will show\noff its strategy\n\nExclusive But unhappy European buyers have called for regulators to step in\n\nVirtualization1 month | 3\n\n#### Elon Musk's latest brainfart is to turn Tesla cars into AWS on wheels\n\nThere are many reasons why this is likely more trouble than it's worth\n\nOn-Prem3 days | 134\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
