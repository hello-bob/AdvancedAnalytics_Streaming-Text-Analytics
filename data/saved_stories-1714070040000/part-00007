These ranges, as\ncorroborated by Phoronix, are from 0-15, 32-47, 64-79, and finally 112-127.\nEach number could theoretically correspond to its own CPU or CPU range (e.g.\nStrix Point for mobile, Granite Ridge for desktop), though the existence of\npre-release CPUs, development-only CPUs, etc., means that not all of these\nwill be released \u2014 and some may never be used.\n\nThe timing of these patches in proximity to Zen 5 Strix Point Geekbench\nresults uncovered yesterday on Twitter adds yet more fuel to speculation that\nZen 5 could be arriving sooner rather than later. We've also previously\nreported on Zen 5-related updates to Linux's GCC compiler and PMC driver.\nUnfortunately, besides knowledge of the model number ranges, the latest Linux\npatches don't really teach us anything new about Zen 5 or its upcoming CPUs.\n\nBased on the information we do have, though, we can expect significant\nimprovements to AI performance and iGPU performance thanks to XDNA 2 and RDNA\n3+, respectively. XDNA 2 is expected to deliver over 70 TOPS in AI\nperformance, which is nearly twice the 40 TOPS requirement for \"next-gen AI\nPCs.\" We don't quite know what to expect from the RDNA 3+ improvements yet,\nbut AMD's track record has kept RDNA 3 on top of the iGPU market despite\ncompetition from Intel, so AMD still seems strong there.\n\nIn any case, the latest Zen 5 Linux kernel patches at least point toward AMD\nwanting lots of room to work with.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nIn total, there are 64 potential Zen 5 CPU model numbers being placed into the\ncode now (16 per 4 ranges) to account for future development and/or releases.\nThat seems like a lot of room for experimentation with things such as\nhandheld-tailored APU designs, more powerful desktop integrated graphics, and\nso on. Other leaks point toward AMD's Strix Point mobile CPUs adopting Zen 5C\ncores, as well.\n\nEdit 04/25/2024 3:25am PT: Clarified title to denote the new family applies to\nall Zen 5 models.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

These are just basically AMD \"Family\n26\" CPUs being listed. Zen 5 CPU lineup is labeled as \"Family 26\" by AMD.\n\nAnd NO, there aren't 64 \"new\" CPU model IDs added though either.\n\nOnly the following models from range \"0x10 to 0x1f (16 to 31)\" are now being\nalso treated as Zen 5 processors (15 in total). The rest of the models are OLD\n(they are also Zen 5 chips though).\n\nReply\n\n  * Metal Messiah.\n\nBy the way, since the ZEN 5 lineup will encompass a lot of CPU families, and\nmany Ryzen and EPYC SKUs share the same model ID, AMD could even drop some of\nthe models in future, or never use them at all.\n\nCould be any of these, or the newly added 15 model IDs could be just a rehash.\n\nEPYC Turin,\n\nRyzen Threadripper \"Shimada Peak\",\n\nRyzen \"Granite Ridge\",\n\nRyzen \"Fire Range\",\n\nRyzen \"Strix Point\n\nRyzen \"Strix Halo\",\n\nRyzen \"Kraken Point\"\n\nRyzen \"Escher\"\n\nRyzen \"Sonoma Valley\"\n\nReply\n\n  * TheyCallMeContra\n\n> Metal Messiah. said:\n>\n> Those are NOT \"Strix Point\" processors.

Phoronix\npoints toward all the ranges being referenced corresponding to Family 26 CPUs.\n16 to 31 is new, but the others listed should also correspond to Family 26 or\nZen 5 CPUs unless Phoronix misreported. Do you mind throwing a citation my way\nto help clear this up?\n\nReply\n\n  * TerryLaze\n\n> TheyCallMeContra said:\n>\n> Title is an artifact of earlier in the article writing, didn't mean to imply\n> Strix Point and Zen 5 were one and the same and meant to make that edit\n> sooner- my bad.\n>\n> The other thing I actually am going to be contentious about, though.\n> Phoronix points toward all the ranges being referenced corresponding to\n> Family 26 CPUs. 16 to 31 is new, but the others listed should also\n> correspond to Family 26 or Zen 5 CPUs unless Phoronix misreported.
