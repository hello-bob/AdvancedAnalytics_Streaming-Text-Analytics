Windows continuously delayed an anticipated feature\nfor Windows 10, before quietly axing it altogether. Even construction of the\nSydney Opera House was only supposed to take four years. It ended up taking\n14.\n\nBut why does this happen? Why does team productivity (and as a result, your\nschedule) run off the rails? Parkinson\u2019s Law has a lot to do with it.\n\n## What is Parkinson\u2019s Law?\n\nParkinson\u2019s Law is the old adage that work expands to fill the time allotted\nfor its completion. The term was first coined by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in\na humorous essay he wrote for \u201cThe Economist\u201d in 1955. He shares the story of\na woman whose only task in a day is to send a postcard \u2013 a task which would\ntake a busy person approximately three minutes. But the woman spends an hour\nfinding the card, another half hour looking for her glasses, 90 minutes\nwriting the card, 20 minutes deciding whether or not to take an umbrella along\non her walk to the mailbox ... and on and on until her day is filled. Read his\noriginal article here.\n\nLet\u2019s look at an updated example. You and your team have two weeks to complete\na relatively simple bug fix. Realistically, it should only take a few hours.\n\nBut because you know you have more than enough time at your disposal, the\nproject grows in scope. While you\u2019re looking into that bug, you decide to\ncheck into a few related issues, as well. That prompts questions about what\u2019s\ncausing those issues in the first place. While those diversions may ultimately\nprove to be useful, they don\u2019t get you any closer to achieving your object of\nhandling the bug fix.\n\nUltimately, the thing that should\u2019ve really been a simple undertaking becomes\nsomething that actually requires the two weeks to complete. That\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s\nLaw in action.\n\n## Why work expands to fill the time available\n\nAside from the work itself becoming increasingly complex, procrastination is\nanother key player in Parkinson\u2019s Law. Knowing that we have a set amount of\ntime to do something often inspires us to leave work to the very last minute \u2013\nand our delays in getting started mean the time required for that task\nexpands.\n\nAumarie Benipayo, a program manager at Atlassian, saw this happen firsthand in\na previous position, where she worked with development teams that organized\nwork into four-week sprints. \u201cAll of the work that was required for that\nsprint was coming in at the very end,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing was being completed\nin the duration of the four weeks.\u201d\n\nWhy? Well, one educated guess is that looming deadlines are motivating. The\nYerkes-Dodson Law says that there\u2019s an optimal level of arousal that improves\nour task performance. So, that fast-approaching end date gives us a much-\nneeded kick in the pants to buckle down and focus.\n\nRelated Article\n\n#### 9 neuroplasticity exercises to boost productivity\n\nBy Jonathan Thompson In Productivity\n\n## Parkinson\u2019s Law of Triviality\n\nWhile Parkinson\u2019s Law is most often talked about in regard to personal\nproductivity, it really rears its ugly head in group settings where\ncounterproductive tendencies are ever-present. For example, Parkinson\u2019s Law of\nTriviality states that people within organizations often give undue time and\nattention to trivial matters.\n\nThere\u2019s also social loafing, which is the tendency of people working in groups\nto put forth less effort than they would on solo projects.\n\n\u201cYou know there are a lot of other people responsible, which sort of lessens\nyour own agency and those feelings of social responsibility get distributed\nout among the whole group,\u201d explains Nick Wignall, a clinical psychologist and\nauthor.\n\n## How do you overcome Parkinson\u2019s Law?\n\nUnderstanding Parkinson\u2019s Law is only half the battle. What you really want to\nknow is how to prevent that eleventh-hour crunch to get work shipped.\n\nHowever, combating Parkinson\u2019s Law isn\u2019t something that will easily happen\nwhen you\u2019re smack dab in the middle of a project.\n\nThe best route is to start early by planning a successful project kickoff\nwhere you can set expectations about how your team will approach and conquer\nthose larger projects that are prone to scope creep and procrastination.\nHere\u2019s what you should cover during that meeting.\n\n### 1\\. Clearly outline your vision statement and drivers\n\nImagine that your boss just asked you to to alphabetize a giant stack of files\n(no rush \u2013 whenever you can get around to it). You have no idea what the files\nare, if they\u2019re important, or why they need to be alphabetized. How motivated\nare you to tackle those files right away?\n\nNot very, right? That\u2019s because there\u2019s no clear importance or impact\nassociated with the task, and research shows that teams that understand how\ntheir work fits in to the bigger picture are more effective (they\u2019re more\ncreative and resilient, to boot).\n\nAt the start of your group project, it should be made obvious to your team:\n\n  * What this project\u2019s value is (this is the vision)\n  * Why this project makes sense for your team and your organization (these are the drivers)\n\nEnsuring alignment around those pieces empowers team members to see the impact\nof their work, which will ignite their motivation and sense of ownership over\ntheir assigned tasks and milestones.\n\n### 2\\. Clarify roles and responsibilities\n\nFor any project, but especially ones with a lot of different players and teams\nin the mix, it\u2019s crucial that you clearly outline where everybody fits.\n\nUse the DACI framework to establish clear roles related to group work and\ndecision-making. \u201cDACI\u201d stands for:\n\n  * D = Driver. The one person responsible for corralling stakeholders, collating all necessary information, and getting a decision made by the agreed date. This may or may not be the project\u2019s full-time owner, depending on the decision.\n  * A = Approver. The one person who makes the decision.\n  * C = Contributors. They have knowledge or expertise that may influence the decision (i.e., they have a voice, but no vote).\n  * I = Informed. They are informed of the final decision.\n\nUsing this sort of framework to show team members how their role fits in helps\nto prevent buck-passing and social loafing, as they\u2019re forced to take more\naccountability for their assigned responsibilities and contributions.\n\nRelated Article\n\n#### Science just confirmed what you already knew: Zoom fatigue is real\n\nBy Jill Waldbieser In Teamwork\n\nThis also helps to streamline expectations around communication and feedback,\nwhich can be major sticking points in group projects.\n\nThis framework establishes who has the final say on decisions and projects,\nwhich eliminates a lot of the back and forth about (oftentimes conflicting)\nrevisions and suggestions that cause projects to expand and drag on.\n\n### 3\\. Understand what\u2019s in and out of scope\n\nRemember, Parkinson\u2019s Law is more than a fancy term for procrastination \u2013 it\nmeans that work expands to fill the allotted time. That\u2019s the very definition\nof scope creep.\n\nDuring your project kickoff, you and your team should agree upfront about what\nis in and out of scope for the project.\n\nBy establishing these guidelines from the outset, your whole team is better\nequipped to nip Parkinson\u2019s Law in the bud. When a new feature request or\nanother suggestion comes up during the course of the project, you can point\nback to your project kickoff and remind the team that you all agreed that sort\nof thing was out of scope.\n\nThink of this step as building a box for your project. You define parameters\nthat the project needs to fit within, which is a surefire way to catch work\nexpansion as it\u2019s happening, rather than after it\u2019s already sabotaged your\ntimeline.\n\n### 4\\. Identify your trade-offs\n\nDespite your best intentions in hosting an effective project kickoff, things\nstill happen. Unexpected surprises crop up and threaten to throw your whole\nproject out of scope and off schedule.\n\nIn those moments, you\u2019ll be glad that you identified your trade-offs early on.\nYour trade-offs allow you to see where you have the most wiggle room available\nin a project, should you need to make last-minute adjustments.\n\nTiming, scope, and budget are the most common vectors to play with here, and\nthese should be prioritized during your kickoff.\n\nFor example, if your team is working to get a new product created ahead of an\nupcoming user conference, then timing is your most important metric. The\nproduct absolutely needs to be done by then, which might mean you\u2019ll need to\nmake some tradeoffs in terms of scope (reducing features) and/or budget\n(investing more).\n\nThis might seem disheartening to do at the start of a project, but it\u2019s\nundeniably helpful when you reach those critical moments when decisions need\nto be made. Benipayo explains that understanding trade-offs was a huge benefit\nduring the recent redesign of this very blog you are reading right now!\n\n\u201cOnce we realized that the work was not going to be completed in time as it\nwas scoped, the team was able to go back and re-prioritize what was most\nimportant for launch.\u201d says Benipayo.\n\nIt\u2019s almost the exact opposite of Parkinson\u2019s Law \u2014 rather than work expanding\nto fit allotted time, you might actually need to reduce the work or other\nexpectations to fit the time window.\n\n### 5\\. Set your timeline\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that the timeline is the last step of the project kickoff,\nisn\u2019t it? That almost never happens in real life. But it\u2019s a smart way to\napproach projects.\n\nThink about building a house. You wouldn\u2019t approach a builder and say, \u201cI need\na house that\u2019s this size and looks exactly like this example, and I need it by\nthis date.\u201d No, you and the builder would talk through your expectations and\nthe work required, and then set a completion date with that information in\nmind.\n\n###### Tip\n\nSet your deadlines in days rather than weeks or months. One study showed it\u2019s\na small mental shift that can amp up that urgency factor.\n\nIn an ideal world, group projects would work the same way. The timeline would\ncome last, after you and team members have agreed on the scope.\n\nWhile outlining your timeline, you should identify milestones and deadlines\nthat occur within the project. \u201cYou need to be really deliberate about\nbreaking down group projects or goals into subgroups,\u201d explains Wignall.\n\nThis makes the larger project more manageable, and instills a greater sense of\nurgency to get the work started \u2013 even if the end date for the whole project\nisn\u2019t fast-approaching, the deadline for that first task certainly is. Plus,\nthis allows the team to feel like they\u2019re gaining meaningful momentum on the\nproject, which is highly motivating (something referred to as the progress\nprinciple).\n\nSubscribe to Work Life\n\nGet stories like this in your inbox\n\nAbout this Article\n\nPublished February 12, 2022\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKat Boogaard Contributing Writer\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * Pocket\n  * Email\n\nRelated Content\n\n### More in Productivity\n\nProductivity\n\n#### AI is changing work for the better \u2013 here\u2019s how\n\nProductivity\n\n#### 7 sneaky ways friction is making your work life harder\n\nProductivity\n\n#### How to build critical thinking skills for better decision-making\n\nProductivity\n\n#### The truth about compressed workweeks, according to people who\u2019ve done it\n\n#### More Collections\n\nCollection\n\n### Wellbeing at Work\n\nLaying the groundwork for better employee health and happiness.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Remote Work\n\nWork-from-home tips and ideas, from our team to yours.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Company Culture\n\nEmbrace transparency, foster a sense of belonging, form connections \u2013 and have\nfun along the way.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Wellbeing at Work\n\nLaying the groundwork for better employee health and happiness.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Remote Work\n\nWork-from-home tips and ideas, from our team to yours.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Company Culture\n\nEmbrace transparency, foster a sense of belonging, form connections \u2013 and have\nfun along the way.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Wellbeing at Work\n\nLaying the groundwork for better employee health and happiness.\n\nView Collection\n\n#### What is Parkinson\u2019s Law and why is it sabotaging your productivity?\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * Pocket\n  * Email\n\nJoin over 80,000 working professionals\n\nBy Atlassian\n\nCulture, tech, teams, and tips, delivered twice a month\n\n  * Atlassian.com\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2023 Atlassian\n\nThis site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience, perform analytics\nand research, and conduct advertising.
