The elevators only run to\nthe 48th floor, just below the top of the pyramid\u2019s \u201cshoulders,\u201d those broad,\nblocky fins approximately 600 feet above the street.\n\nThe east shoulder contains an elevator bank. The west shoulder functions as a\nventilation shaft. It\u2019s an enormous void, a little like a chasm on the Death\nStar. When a team of three from The Standard got a guided tour that went all\nthe way to the pyramid\u2019s beacon, the railing next to that abyss was\nessentially base camp.\n\nMichaela Neville climbs to the top of the Transamerica Pyramid's spire, via a set of 10 stairways and two ladders that contain 236 steps in all. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The StandardRenovation work on the pyramid is very much active, as this hole through a floor hundreds of feet above downtown San Francisco reveals. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\nTo get to the top, we climbed 10 terrifying sets of stairs\u2014and then a ladder\nthat\u2019s followed by another ladder. The spire\u2019s \u201cwalls,\u201d we learned, are\ntranslucent plastic cladding that\u2019s more or less open to the elements. That\nmeans on foggy days, the steps and railings become slick with moisture.\n\n\u201cWear comfy shoes,\u201d our guide, a rep for pyramid owner Michael Shvo, had\ninstructed us. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be afraid of heights.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think of myself as having a fear of heights, but that was before my\nstomach itself started sweating. Aside from the time I went hang-gliding in\nBrazil with a guide who didn\u2019t speak English, I can\u2019t remember a time when I\nwas so acutely afraid of losing my grip on a metal bar and plummeting to my\ndeath.\n\nEventually, we made it to the space that houses the beacon. Like everything\nelse about William Pereira\u2019s modernist 1972 masterpiece, that dazzlingly\nintense, bluish light is set to undergo a major overhaul as part of a $400\nmillion renovation. Luxury developer Michael Shvo is reimagining the building\nfrom top to bottom, installing amenities like a spa and a sky bar, as well as\nan all-new lighting scheme that will announce the Transamerica Pyramid\u2019s\npresence by night the way its distinctive shape already does by day.\n\n## Office as resort\n\nEven though the Transamerica Corporation vacated the building in 1999, Shvo\nhas no plans to rename it. Pretty much everything else about it is going to\nchange, though. The guiding principle, of \u201coffice as resort,\u201d will bring a\nvibe associated with luxe tech campuses into downtown San Francisco.\n\nAn aerial drone night view of TransAmerica Pyramid and buildings in San Francisco on March 15, 2024. | Source: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu/Getty ImagesSan Francisco Standard Social Media Editor Michaela Neville, left, Photography intern Estefany Gonzalez, center, and Senior Editor Astrid Kane pose for a selfie at the very top of the Transamerica Pyramid\u2019s spire. | Source: Michaela Neville/The Standard\n\nThe ground level has already been redesigned to feel more welcoming. Having\nbought the pyramid for $650 million in 2020, Shvo enlisted Norman Foster, the\nBritish architect best known in the Bay Area for Apple\u2019s spaceship-like\nheadquarters in Cupertino. Foster + Partners raised the Transamerica lobby\nceiling by about 4 feet, revealing K-braces and other geometric details that\nopened it up to the sunlight. Quartz, sourced from the same Mexican quarry as\nthe building\u2019s facade, was mixed with mortar to give the space some extra\nsparkle that concrete can\u2019t provide. Overall, in the words of one Shvo\nrepresentative, it was like ripping up tired shag carpet to reveal a parquet\nwood floor beneath.\n\nThe renovation extends outside the building, too. The redwood plaza behind the\npyramid\u2014one of the city\u2019s many privately owned public open spaces, or POPOS\u2014is\nset to reopen to the public later this year. With less concrete hardscape and\na more organic feel, it\u2019s intended to make the building, still San Francisco\u2019s\nsecond-tallest after Salesforce Tower, feel like less of a monolith.\n\nA vestibule at the rear will become a space called the Court Club, and in\nSeptember, it will house an exhibition of Foster\u2019s work plus a history of the\nMontgomery Block, the hub for writers and bohemians like Jack London and Mark\nTwain that once occupied the site. An alley that runs for half a block\nimmediately behind the pyramid, Mark Twain Street, has also been planted with\nwestern redbuds, transforming it from its prior incarnation as a loading dock\nfor Recology trucks.\n\nBullish on the return to physical offices, Shvo is among those who see\nartificial intelligence as the city\u2019s path out of its prolonged, post-Covid\nslump\u2014and he\u2019s keen on leveraging the pyramid\u2019s status to lure AI\u2019s funders to\nbecome his tenants.\n\nCaution tape covers an open gap that's currently under construction in the Transamerica Pyramid, with Nob Hill visible at left and Russian Hill at right. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\n\u201cNow that there's a general consensus that San Francisco is not going to get\nwiped off the planet,\u201d Shvo said of the economic climate. \u201cWe\u2019re the\nbenefactor of that, because we're doing deals at the VC level or at the\nprivate-equity level that cater to these AI companies.\u201d\n\nThe bet appears to be paying off, and not just for AI. Law firm Baker\nHostetler recently renewed its lease, and overall, the pyramid commands\nimpressive sums.\n\n\u201cWe've signed multiple leases over $200 a square foot. That makes the pyramid\nthe third-most expensive building in the United States,\u201d Shvo said, adding\nthat the other two are both in Midtown Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s also the only building\n[of the three] that\u2019s 50 years old.\u201d\n\n## A beacon to rival the Eiffel Tower\u2019s\n\nThe renovation will leave no element of the Transamerica Pyramid untouched,\nand that includes the beacon, set to become a 5,600-watt dynamic theatrical\nLED lighting system. Sharp-eyed observers may have noticed that it has been\nilluminated somewhat randomly over the last few months\u2014that\u2019s because design\nfirm L\u2019Observatoire International is running occasional tests.\n\nThe company\u2019s lighting designer Herv\u00e9 Descottes, who has worked on New York\u2019s\nHigh Line and the Fondation Louis Vuitton Paris, compared the new beacon to\nhis forthcoming knee replacement, calling it \u201cnew blood in an old body.\u201d It\u2019s\na delicate operation, installing technology that didn\u2019t exist in 1972 without\nchanging the relationship of the pyramid to the city. He refers to the top of\nthe building as a shrine, and the light as a jewel.\n\nThe beacon at the pyramid's very top is housed in a tiny room and encased behind gem-toned plastic panels. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\nIt\u2019s \u201calmost like the beam of light on the Eiffel Tower,\u201d he said of his\nproject. \u201cA dancing jewel that can change color.\u201d\n\nThe beacon isn\u2019t the only lighting element, either. The sides of the spire\nwill soon be outfitted with LED technology of their own, similar to the crown\nof the Salesforce Tower or the upper floors of the Empire State Building.\n\n\u201cWe are full-speed ahead,\u201d Descottes said. \u201cIt could be before the end of the\nyear.\u201d\n\nThe building's western fin, or \"shoulder,\" is a ventilation shaft. Above the 48th floor, there is no more space for offices. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\n## The climb to the top is terrifying\n\nTo get to Descottes\u2019 jewel from the 48th floor, we had to climb exactly 236\nvertical steps, starting from what will eventually be the sky bar. It\u2019s\nessentially a construction site, filled with ladders and plastic sheeting, but\nthe panoramic views will make for a uniquely glamorous spot for a client lunch\nor after-work martini.\n\nEven on a sunny afternoon, climbing up isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. Climbers\nhave almost no choice but to disobey the first principle of heights: \u201cDon\u2019t\nlook down.\u201d For this reporter, the third and fourth set of stairs were the\nangstiest, as it was clear we had climbed about 50 feet with quite a ways to\ngo. It was then that our guide saw fit to mention that seismically, a pyramid-\nshaped structure is the safest place to be during an earthquake, a remark that\nhad the opposite of its intended effect.\n\nThe view from the bottom of the spire, one story above the future sky bar on the 48th floor, shows a single cavernous room with nothing but stairs and walkways. | Source: Estefany Gonzalez/The Standard\n\nEven though the metal steps grew considerably narrower, the climb got easier\nas we neared the top, because it became harder to see down. Putting aside the\nterror, the ascent was also a legitimate workout, but once our pounding hearts\ngot to the beacon\u2014a cramped crow\u2019s nest too small for an adult to stand\u2014we had\na uniquely magical perspective on the city far below, filthy windows be\ndamned. The light itself has a crystal, like what might power a warp drive,\nsurrounded by 32 gem-toned panes of glass.\n\nThe expedition was a rare treat, no doubt about it, but also something most\npeople might want to do just once. Even Shvo only makes the trip every so\noften. \"Probably, I think five times?\" he said. \"I'm not a big lover of\nheights. And it gets quite steep when you get up there, right? And then the\ngoing down is a whole other experience.\"\n\nThe current steps are new, he added. \u201cWhen I bought the building, it was much\nscarier.\u201d\n\nAstrid Kane can be reached at astrid@sfstandard.com\n\n## Filed Under\n\nDowntownLifeMichael ShvoTransamerica Pyramid\n\n## Read More\n\n  * ### Photos: A sunny day, a sea of bikes and a wheelie-popping fashion show in the Mission\n\nHundreds of bike enthusiasts descended on Folsom Street for a celebratory\nCinco de Mayo rideout and bike fashion show.\n\n  * ### Take a tour of Sausalito\u2019s million-dollar houseboats\n\nFloating homes\u2019 residents say community spirit anchors longtime dwellers among\na natural backdrop of flora, fauna and friendships.\n\n  * ### We went to San Francisco\u2019s \u2018first-ever AI simulated party\u2019 so you didn\u2019t have to\n\nA trip to the Mission Control hacker house, where a surreal virtual rager was\nfollowed by an actual DJ dance party.\n\n  * ### \u2018Tits Up\u2019 author Sarah Thornton and her uplifting quest to reclaim the breast\n\nFrom topless bars to milk banks, surgeons\u2019 offices to bra studios, Sarah\nThornton immerses herself everywhere breasts are put to work.\n\n  * ### After a near-death experience, an iconic SF mansion gets another chance at life\n\nBooks worth thousands\u2014and only a couple of dollars\u2014to be sold at the reopening\nof Haas-Lilienthal House.\n\n## Popular Today\n\n  1. 1\n\n### San Francisco\u2019s most powerful political group is in crisis\n\n  2. 2\n\n### He speaks fluent Chinese.
