Demonstrating its\nmenace to the waterway, Iran seized a vessel there on April 13, the same day\nit launched its attack on Israel.\n\nThe crude price calm in the face of this turmoil owes much to events 7,000\nmiles away in the shale fields of North Dakota and west Texas, where drillers\nhave left global markets awash with American oil.\n\n\u201cShale has redrawn the map of world oil in a way most people don\u2019t seem to\nunderstand,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, vice-chair of S&P Global and a Pulitzer\nPrize-winning energy historian. \u201cIt has changed not only the supply-demand\nbalance but it has changed the geopolitical balance and the psychological\nbalance.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are stark. Two decades ago the US produced about 7mn barrels a day\nof petroleum and consumed 21mn. Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \u2014\nwhich send oil through the Strait of Hormuz \u2014 were among the US\u2019s most\nimportant foreign suppliers.\n\nNow the US produces almost 20mn b/d of petroleum, roughly on par with\nconsumption. Imports from the Gulf have plummeted, and the US became a net oil\nexporter for the first time in 2019. The prolific Permian Basin shale of Texas\nand New Mexico pumps more oil than Kuwait, Iraq or the UAE, three of Opec\u2019s\npowerhouses.\n\nThe strategic advantages are profound, say analysts, even for a White House\neager to transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy.\n\nThe shale surge has blunted the impact of supply cuts made by Opec in the past\ntwo years, they say, and allowed President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s to\nimpose sanctions on suppliers such as Venezuela and Russia, while tightening\nrestrictions on Iran \u2014 all without fear of driving up oil prices.\n\n\u201cIt is a huge turnaround from where we were at in the 1970s,\u201d said Harold\nHamm, chair of Continental Resources and a shale pioneer. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have\nthe shale revolution now you would have $150 oil . . . You would be in a very\nvolatile situation. It would be horrendous.\u201d\n\nRising shale supplies also helped keep the lights on in Europe following\nMoscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with shipments of US\nliquefied natural gas \u2014 previously labelled \u201cmolecules of US freedom\u201d by the\nTrump administration \u2014 helping to wean the continent off Russian piped\nsupplies.\n\nThe extent of shale\u2019s significance to oil markets was already visible in 2019,\nYergin said, after a devastating drone attack on the Abqaiq crude processing\nfacility in Saudi Arabia, the nerve centre of its oil sector. Crude prices\nrose sharply \u2014 and then fell back almost as quickly.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s when it became clear to me that there had been a great\nrebalancing,\u201d Yergin said.\n\nEven so, experts warn that the US still remains vulnerable to oil shocks. All-\nout war between Israel and Iran, or a big new plunge in exports \u2014 for example\nif the Strait of Hormuz were to be shut \u2014 would inevitably remove supplies\nfrom a fungible global market, raising petrol prices from Beijing to Boston.\n\n\u201cWe are still acutely exposed to geopolitics and market manipulation. And\nshale doesn\u2019t really help with that,\u201d said Jim Krane at Rice University\u2019s\nBaker Institute. \u201cYes, we\u2019re a big producer. But more importantly, we\u2019re a big\nconsumer, and that\u2019s where our exposure lies.\u201d\n\nThe US accounts for about 20 per cent of global demand, driven by the\ncountry\u2019s reliance on big, gas-guzzling vehicles.\n\nShale also remains uniquely vulnerable to price gyrations, making it an\nunreliable component of the global oil market, say some analysts.\n\nIt was only four years ago that crashing oil prices during the Covid-19\npandemic pushed many shale producers to the brink of bankruptcy. Then-\nPresident Donald Trump was forced to plead with Saudi Arabia and Russia to\nslash their own output to prop up prices to spare the shale patch \u2014 a\ndemonstration of US energy vulnerability.\n\nAfter Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine triggered an oil price increase in 2022, it\nwas Biden\u2019s turn to press the Saudis for help, this time urging them to pump\nmore to beat back soaring US petrol costs.\n\nShale executives are themselves sceptical that drillers could raise supply\nquickly enough to rescue the global economy from a sudden oil shock. Wall\nStreet remains reluctant to fund new drilling campaigns by producers that\nearned a reputation for profligacy in recent years.\n\nThe Biden administration has been conscious of that dynamic \u2014 and also of the\npolitical consequences of higher gasoline prices ahead of elections. Last\nyear, one senior Biden adviser said Wall Street was being \u201cun-American\u201d in\nholding back drillers.\n\nThe White House\u2019s diplomatic focus has been to prevent further turmoil in the\nMiddle East.\n\n\u201cWe have an election and the Biden administration cannot, cannot, cannot\nafford to act recklessly or precipitously in the region. They\u2019re being\nextraordinarily careful with every step they take,\u201d said Matt Gertken, a\ngeopolitical strategist at BCA Research.\n\nThe administration has also said it remains willing to use stored strategic\nreserves of oil to keep prices at bay. At about $3.68 per gallon, US petrol\nprices may be lower than in other economies \u2014 but they are up 15 per cent this\nyear.\n\n\u201cBottom line is that it is always better as a nation to have your own oil,\u201d\nsaid Amy Myers Jaffe, a professor at NYU.\n\n\u201cBut alas, [crude] prices will go up if there is a market supply shock and\nthat will probably transmit itself back to US drivers as higher fuel prices \u2014\nglobal market and all that.\u201d\n\nBig deals in US shale may not mean boom times are back | FT Energy Source\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.
