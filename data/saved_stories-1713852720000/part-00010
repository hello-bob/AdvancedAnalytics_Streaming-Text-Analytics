It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTech Conferences: Does Your Employer Pay?\n\nDoes your employer pay for you to attend tech conferences?\n\nYes, registration and travel are comped.\n\nYes, just registration but not travel expenses.\n\nYes, travel expenses but not registration.\n\nOnly virtual conferences.\n\nNo reimbursement.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nGarden.io sponsored this post.\n\nThings tend to move in cycles. We\u2019re always swinging between one extreme and\nanother, reacting against \u2014 and differentiating ourselves from \u2014 what came\nbefore. This is true in a broadly historical sense and for development.\n\nYou could rewrite the history of development tooling in cycles of\ncentralization and decentralization \u2014 the constant battle to balance\nstandardization and autonomy, scalability and velocity. Just when it seems\nwe\u2019ve reached a solution, the pendulum swings the other way.\n\nThe rise of platform teams has been well documented, and management of\ninternal developer platforms is increasingly a core function. But as the\ncomplexity of these systems scales, and the tax of building and maintaining\nthem sours the benefits of vending them, does it feel to anyone else like the\npendulum is about to drop?\n\n## The Rise of the Internal Developer Platform\n\nBefore containers, there was VMware, and we were obsessed with making self-\nprovisioning platforms for developers so they could interact with\ninfrastructure in a minimal way. We could just ask for the VM we needed and\nstart developing it right away.\n\nWhen Infrastructure as Code came about, we broke up these VMs and moved toward\nmicroservices. Rather than having this monolithic platform, we decided that a\ndecentralized platform that separated concerns would allow us to scale better.\nEach team could work within their own city-state. And when things didn\u2019t work,\nthe culture of DevOps helped the teams communicate with each other.\n\nGarden\u2019s DevOps platform simplifies environment management and testing for\ncloud-native apps. We\u2019re improving the developer experience and speeding up\nthe software delivery cycle by reducing friction, CI bottlenecks, and context-\nswitching overhead.\n\nLearn More\n\nThe latest from Garden.io\n\nOne year of remote development environments on K8s | garden.io\n\n8 January 2024\n\nCross-cutting concerns in microservices development | garden.io\n\n8 January 2024\n\nContinuous Integration tools: Are we too dependent on them? | garden.io\n\n5 January 2024\n\nBut this too started to feel out of hand. Containers kept getting smaller and\nsmaller, and the complexity was greater and greater. And now, due to human\nnature, we\u2019re doing what we always do: something radically different. Each\ntime we reach some tipping point of complexity, we change gears again.\nDecentralization isn\u2019t working as we\u2019d hoped; we need a more centralized\npattern.\n\nInternal developer platforms mark a return to this centralized view of\ndevelopment. We\u2019re building self-provisioning platforms with the hope that\ndevelopers don\u2019t have to talk to operations.\n\nBut we\u2019re coming up against the same pitfalls \u2014 just moving our peas from one\nside of the plate to the other. The complexity never really goes away.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. What Comes after Internal Developer Platforms?\n  2. Drive Developer Self-Service with Crossplane, K8s and a Portal\n  3. Want to Be a Tech Company? Try Platform Engineering!\n  4. Your Engineering Organization Is too Expensive\n  5. Unleash AI in Platform Engineering to Streamline Software Delivery\n\n## The Risks of Internal Developer Platforms\n\nInternal developer platforms should, in principle, reduce the cognitive load\nfor developers by lumping all the operational tools that come with containers\ninto one place. But is this kind of centralization really effective? Serving\nyour developers one central platform comes with big risks.\n\n### Overengineering\n\nThe analysts said, \u201cGo build a platform.\u201d But the problem with recommendations\nlike this is that they are made with companies like Netflix in mind. Most\ncompanies are simply not of the same size and scale that they\u2019d ever have the\nproblems that companies like Netflix have, but they\u2019re tasked with solving\nthem anyway.\n\n### Resource Sinkhole\n\nA brand-new platform team might spend two years and millions of dollars\nbuilding a new internal product for developers: the internal developer\nplatform. But there are no guarantees that, once built, this new product will\nwork for people.\n\nBefore you\u2019ve spent all those dollars and hours and sweat and tears, how can\nyou know if the platform is ever going to return value?\n\n### Tooling Silos\n\nEnterprise solutions are complex propositions. Increasingly specialized\ntooling for each stage of the software development life cycle has made\nspecific organizational roles easier, but has done little to improve\ncollaboration with other roles using their own specialized tools. Each team\nends up in a tooling silo.\n\nThe original idea behind DevOps was to address this siloing by adjusting\norganizational structure and improving communication. The internal developer\nplatform envisioned as a foolproof way for a developer to deliver their\napplications without friction, marks a shift away from this communication and\ncollaboration. In 2024\u2019s version of \u201cthrowing it over the wall,\u201d the wall is\nbetween platform teams and developers, and no one quite knows what\u2019s happening\non the other side.\n\nWe need tools that promote communication in general, not just communication\naround tools. Let\u2019s acknowledge that stakeholders utilize different required\nskills and live in different worlds. Rather than seeking the lowest common\ndenominator between these stakeholders, let\u2019s max out their capabilities by\ngiving them the ability to focus on what they\u2019re good at.\n\n## What Comes Next?\n\nWhat if, instead of ping-ponging between centralization and decentralization,\nbetween tooling silos and The One Tool to Rule Them All, we facilitate\nconversations between tools? What if we provide each of the subject matter\nexperts that make up a complex solution a common framework for describing,\ndeploying and testing their scope of work?\n\nSuch a solution would be a lightweight alternative to the IDP all-or-nothing\napproach, without a completely decentralized free-for-all.\n\nAt Garden, we\u2019re working to help teams work in a more modular way, giving them\nthe ability to source others\u2019 work in order to test their own work against the\nbigger picture. We believe that tools that handle complexity, rather than\nabstracting it away or kicking it to other teams, will come next.\n\nValerie Slaughter helps developer-facing companies generate high-value, high-\nconverting content.\n\nRead more from Valerie Slaughter\n\nGarden.io sponsored this post.\n\nSHARE THIS STORY\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1.
