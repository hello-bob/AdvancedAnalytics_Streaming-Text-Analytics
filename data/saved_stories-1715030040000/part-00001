FREDERIC J. BROWN\n\n  * Fisker employees are using parts from preproduction vehicles and inventory to fix some customers' cars, eight sources said.\n  * The practice has been ongoing since Fisker began deliveries in June 2023, some sources say.\n  * Experts say the practice can be acceptable to avoid long wait times, but customers should be informed of part swaps.\n\nNEW LOOK\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech,\nand business \u2014 delivered daily. Read preview\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nAccess your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you're on the go.\n\nFisker employees have been taking parts off preproduction vehicles and\nexisting inventory to fix some customers' cars, several people familiar with\nthe issue told Business Insider.\n\nIn response to a backlog of customer-service requests and a shortage of\navailable parts, Fisker technicians have stripped parts off what some have\ncalled \"donor cars,\" which include Fisker Ocean preproduction and production\nvehicles that are sitting in the company's facility in La Palma, California,\nthree current and five former Fisker employees said. The workers spoke to BI\non the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about\ncompany affairs. Business Insider also viewed several photos of Fisker Ocean\ncars with missing parts that sources say were used for customer vehicles.\n\nA spokesperson for Fisker told Business Insider the information was false.\n\n\"No parts have been taken off these vehicles for use in customers cars,\" the\nspokesperson said, adding that parts may have been taken off engineering\nvehicles \"for analysis or to retrofit other engineering vehicles, but never\ncustomer vehicles.\"\n\nOne current Fisker employee with knowledge of the issue said technicians have\nresorted to taking parts off other cars to address customer-service requests\nin about 10% to 15% of fixes over the past few months, particularly for\ncustomers near the company's La Palma site.\n\n\"It only happens if there's a dire need for the part,\" the worker said.\n\"Technicians are just doing this to help customers. Customers are basically\nbegging for parts, and the mentality is: If we have parts available, let's use\nthem.\"\n\nTypically, the parts are pulled from a back area at the La Palma site, where\nthere is a lineup of preproduction vehicles that some have dubbed the\n\"graveyard,\" five of the sources told BI. Preproduction cars are made after\nprototypes and are essentially beta versions of the vehicle not intended for\ncustomer use \u2014 just testing and demos; production vehicles are the final\nproduct that customers are delivered. Some of the vehicles at the site are\nFisker Oceans that had been returned by customers, two current employees and\none former worker said.\n\n\"It was a place where you just parked cars that were cannibalized. They were\npushed into a space where it wouldn't cause traffic, and it became a place to\ncheck for parts,\" one former worker said. \"It became evident at some point\nthat you couldn't really put these things back together anymore,\" they added.\n\nThe company started taking parts off preproduction and production vehicles\nwhen it began deliveries in June 2023, three former employees said.\n\nWhen the company delivered its first 22 Fisker Oceans some of the cars had to\nbe outfitted with outside parts after a predelivery inspection found at least\nfour of the cars had some faulty parts, including new door handles, seat\nsensors, and a body-control module, three former workers said.\n\n## 'Every day was a fire drill'\n\nOne former worker said that parts swapping became a daily occurrence after the\nvehicle was launched in June 2023. Six employees close to the situation said\nthat supervisors were aware that this practice was happening.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Every day was a fire drill of what car has this part that I need,\" a former\nemployee told BI. \"The first or second time, people were super careful about\nit and then eventually it was done so often that it became second nature and\npeople weren't asking if they could do it anymore \u2014 they were just doing it.\"\n\nOne former worker compared the process to creating a \"Frankenstein\" car.\n\nA Fisker spokesperson said: \"The 'Frankenstein' term was invented by our\nformer CTO and applied to engineering vehicles that were testing multiple\nversions of software.\"\n\nTwo other workers said that technicians were careful to make sure the parts\nthat were going between the vehicles weren't too different, especially if a\npart was going from a preproduction vehicle into a production car.\n\nIt's unclear whether every customer who received a car with swapped-out parts\nwas notified of the switch. Patrick Burrell, a Fisker Ocean owner in\nCalifornia, said he was told by a Fisker employee that the company would fix a\nminor paint and trim issue with his car by using a part that was taken off one\nof Fisker's other cars, but the repair has yet to be complete. Business\nInsider viewed an email exchange between a Fisker employee and Burrell that\nshowed the employee offered to fix Burrell's car using a part from another\nFisker car.\n\nThe email shows that a Fisker employee told Burrell and a repair-shop employee\nthat the company had \"offered to have the mechanic install parts from another\ncar that are good as new.\"\n\n\"These trim pieces are being pulled off a brand-new vehicle so they are\nbasically brand new,\" the worker said in a later email to the customer.\n\nA Fisker spokesperson declined to comment on the email exchange.\n\nBurrell said his car has been waiting at a Fisker-approved repair shop for\nabout 10 weeks.\n\nThe technicians have taken anything from door handles and windshields to\ntires, seat sensors, or body-control modules out of the vehicles to put on\ncustomers' cars, three of the employees said.\n\nTo date, no customer-safety issues have been publicly linked to the issue.\n\nThe process of taking parts from cars off one vehicle to use for a different\none is not unheard of in the automotive industry. Michael Crossen, an\nautomotive technician at Consumer Reports, told BI he's seen it happen\noccasionally over the years \u2014 typically as a courtesy for customers to avoid\nlong wait times for parts.\n\n\"It's certainly not a daily occurrence, but I've seen it a few times over the\nyears,\" Crossen said, adding that parts that are coded to a car's Vehicle\nIdentification Number, or VIN, would be more difficult to swap between cars.\n\nDaniel Blinn, the managing attorney of Consumer Law Group in Connecticut, told\nBI that depending on the situation, it can be acceptable for an automaker to\nuse parts from another vehicle to avoid long wait times for customers. But the\nprocess could become murky if the customer is not informed of the swap or a\npart is not matched perfectly to a vehicle, he said.\n\nFisker has been facing headwinds in recent months. The EV startup has\ndelivered about 6,000 Fisker Oceans to date, according to an internal metric\nviewed by BI. Earlier this year, Fisker lowered its prices by as much as 39%.\n\nThe company has warned it could go out of business by the end of the year.\nLast week, Fisker said in a regulatory filing it had just $54 million in cash\nas of April 16, and the company is trying to pay off a loan that it has\ndefaulted on. On Monday, the company notified staff that they could face\nlayoffs in two months. Fisker's CEO previously told staff that the startup was\nin talks with four different automakers regarding a potential buyout.\n\nDo you work for Fisker or have a tip?
