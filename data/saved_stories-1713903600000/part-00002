After\nthey verify the colors, the leader of the experiment instructs them to always\nsay that both pyramids are white, even if one is black, for any newcomers who\njoin the group.\n\nThe new children who join after the instructions are relayed can see that\nsomething is wrong, but they also say that both pyramids are white. In the\ndebrief after the experiment, where the leader reveals that the children were\ntricking them, she asks gently why the children said that both pyramids were\nwhite, and the girl says, \u201cBecause everyone else said so.\u201d \u201cAnd you repeated\nafter them?\u201d the leader asks. \u201cYes,\u201d the girl nods.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more striking is that the test is then repeated in a group of\nadults, who react exactly the same way.\n\nWhen one of the men is debriefed afterwards, he says, \u201cI probably went with\nwhat the group agreed on because that\u2019s how man\u2019s nature is. If seven people\nsay yes, it is enormously hard for the eighth to say no.\u201d\n\nThis reminded me a lot of one of my favorite essays about how this applies to\nwork, called, \u201cnormalization of deviance.\u201d The author describes behaviors\ncoming into companies that were completely normal in those companies but\nseemed completely strange to him coming from the outside. The essay\u2019s main\nthrust is engineering cultures can be optimized, but my takeaway has always\nbeen that new people joining companies and teams are the best possible\nopportunity to get a sense for what the company and team\u2019s values are and how\nthey should operate:\n\n> People don\u2019t automatically know what should be normal, and when new people\n> are onboarded, they can just as easily learn deviant processes that have\n> become normalized as reasonable processes.\n\n> Julia Evans described to me how this happens:\n\n> new person joins\n\n> new person: WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF\n\n> old hands: yeah we know we\u2019re concerned about it\n\n> new person: WTF WTF wTF wtf wtf w...\n\n> new person gets used to it\n\n> new person #2 joins\n\n> new person #2: WTF WTF WTF WTF\n\n> new person: yeah we know. we\u2019re concerned about it.\n\n> The thing that\u2019s really insidious here is that people will really buy into\n> the WTF idea, and they can spread it elsewhere for the duration of their\n> career. Once, after doing some work on an open source project that\u2019s\n> regularly broken and being told that it\u2019s normal to have a broken build, and\n> that they were doing better than average, I ran the numbers, found that\n> project was basically worst in class, and wrote something about the idea\n> that it\u2019s possible to have a build that nearly always passes with relatively\n> low effort. The most common comment I got in response was, \u201cWow that guy\n> must work with superstar programmers. But let\u2019s get real. We all break the\n> build at least a few times a week\u201d, as if running tests (or for that matter,\n> even attempting to compile) before checking code in requires superhuman\n> abilities. But once people get convinced that some deviation is normal, they\n> often get really invested in the idea.\n\nThere are two interesting orthongonal things going on here: first, when we\nonboard onto a new company, we are bringing all of the experience and baggage\nof our past career in tech. A lot of times, we lean on what we\u2019ve seen work\nwell in certain contexts. \u201cAt my last company, we used Kafka and it was great,\nso we should do that here.\u201d \u201cThe best place I know only uses test-driven-\ndevelopment.\u201d \u201cGo or nothing.\u201d \u201cWe should do kanban (or we should not do\nkanban) Sometimes, this is useful. Sometimes, it\u2019s a form of reminiscing.\n\n> Beyond snacking, which can be valuable when it helps you manage your energy\n> levels, there is a similar pattern that happens when a business or\n> individual goes through a difficult moment: under pressure, most people\n> retreat to their area of highest perceived historical impact, even if it\n> isn\u2019t very relevant to today\u2019s problems. Let\u2019s call this reminiscing.\n\nSometimes this is helfpul, sometimes, it\u2019s not.\n\nSecond, at the same time as we are trying to prove ourselves, remind our\ncompany and team why they picked us - for our expertise, our history, our\nskills - we are also trying to fit into our new team, because you have two\njobs:\n\n> You were hired to write code. Many developers make the mistake and think\n> that their job stops there. That\u2019s not true. In fact, you have two jobs:\n\n> Write good code. Be easy to work with.\n\nThese two ideas, of trying to both stand out and fit in, are extremely strong,\nand both work at odds with each other throughout our careers and our lives.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find a balance and let the intermediate state win, but I find\nthat, just as helpful as working through it, it\u2019s really important even to be\naware that both pyramids, the white and black, exist.\n\nMade with Hugo \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294 Bear\n\n", "frontpage": false}
