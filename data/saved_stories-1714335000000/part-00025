This paper aims to\nperform a sociological analysis of LLMs by having LLMs play games. I am\nparticularly interested in games of the \"prisoner\u2019s dilemma\u201d family, which I\naim to use for my research as well. This paper explores several examples in\nthat space that I found interesting.\n\nGoal Develop an understanding of how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact\nwith humans and other agents in the context of behavioral games with clearly\ndefined rules.\n\nProblem Is it correct to assume that current generations of LLMs are\nbenevolent assistants to humans? What makes LLM chatbots better, and more\npleasant, interactive partners? And I think these are important questions to\nask as we are including genAI in our social and workplaces.\n\nSolution The research team aims to solve this by having LLMs play repeated\ngames against each other. The games are played in finite rounds with full\ninformation. Then they analyze how the LLMs \u201cbehave\u201d when playing against each\nother.\n\nOpinion I think that we are overly anthropomorphizing the reasoning\ncapabilities of GPTs. The research team concludes that they were able to show\nhow GPT-based agents are able to play iterated games in a \u201cselfish, and\nuncoordinated manner sheds light on the fact that there is still significant\nground to cover for LLMs to become truly social and well-aligned machines\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a good paper, but this is a bit of a stretch.\n\nLinks: Paper\n\nLet\u2019s dive in\n\n####\n\nApproach\n\nThe project team then began to evaluate 144 different 2x2 games. In these\ntypes of games, each player usually has only two options. For example in the\npicture above, each player selects either \u201cF\u201d for defection or \u201cJ\u201d for\ncooperation. This is exactly how the \u201cPrisoner\u2019s dilemma\u201d is played.\n\n####\n\nGame Types\n\nThe research team categorized their 144 different games into 5 groups\n\nWin-win - A special case of a non-zero-sum game that produces a mutually\nbeneficial outcome for both players provided that they choose their\ncorresponding best option.\n\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma (PD) family - Players can choose to cooperate or defect.\n\nUnfair games - One player can always win when playing correctly (bottom row of\nthe payoff matrix).\n\nCyclic games - Players could cycle through options.\n\nBiased game - Players need to coordinate to choose the same option.\n\nSecond-best games - it is better to choose the second-best option\n\nThe research team played 1224 games in total: 324 win-win, 63 Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma, 171 unfair, 162 cyclic, 396 biased, and 108 second-best games.\n\nOf course when measuring one\u2019s success in playing any game, one would usually\nintroduce some kind of scoring system to ensure that win/losses are tallied\ncorrectly.\n\nAn interesting deviation here is that for each game, the research team\ncalculated the optimal score that a certain player could have achieved, and\nthen tallied the performance of each agent as a ratio against that agent. For\nexample, if you play 5 rounds of tic-tac-toe, and you will all five, the max\nscore you can get is 5. If you win only 4, then your win ratio is 4/5 or 80%\n\nThe result then looked like this\n\n####\n\nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\n\nSince I am particularly interested in their learnings from the prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma (PD Family), I am exploring the deep dive into this further and will\nconveniently ignore the \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d.\n\nTo recap, in the traditional version of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, two agents can\neither choose to work together, i.e. \u201ccooperate\u201d, for average mutual benefit,\nor betray each other, i.e. \u201cdefect\u201d, for their own benefit and safety. The\nresearch team argues that such games could be an ideal test bed to assess how\nLLMs retaliate after bad interactions.\n\nYet, a retaliatory agent would indicate the agents could react irrationally!\nStill, it is an amazingly interesting question to ask, how agents of different\ncorporate backgrounds would handle this?\n\nIrrespectively, a rationally acting agent is assumed to always \u201cdefect\u201d in the\nsingle-round version of the game, because it has the highest potential payoff.\nI, given you play only one game and there are no real downsides, I guess who\nwouldn\u2019t?\n\nOf course, this changes once a finite or unknown (a player who gets x points\nfirst) number of games. The paper calls it infinite, but for us humans what\ndoes \u201cinfinite\u201d really mean? Would we play a game until the end of our mortal\ncoil?\n\nThe setup of the game is that each player gets 8 points for cooperating (R\nReward in my previous writeup), 10 points for defecting (T Temptation), 5 for\nboth defecting (P - Punishment), and 0 for Losing (L Loss)\n\nTheir reward system follows the canonical version of the game where\n\nTemptation (T) > Reward (R) > Punishment (P) > Loss (L)\n\nBelow the heatmaps are the strategies the research team has tested. These\ngames are highlighted in red.\n\nThe left heatmap shows the defection rate of player 1 in relation to the other\nplayers\n\nThe right heatmap shows the scores accrued accordingly.\n\nOne can observe that GPT-4 continues to defect while playing against the\n\u201cdefect once\u201d agent. While playing against 3.5, GPT-4 defects continuously\nafter getting \u201cdefected\u201d on once.\n\nSince GPT-4 seems to be rather unforgiving, can one conclude that GPT-4 is\nretaliatory? Interesting question to ask, isn\u2019t it? The research team further\nasked if GPT-4 simply did not understand that the other agent wanted to\ncooperate again or if the agent could understand the pattern but just did not\nact accordingly.\n\nSo let\u2019s try...\n\n####\n\nAnother strategy\n\nTo get to the bottom of this, the research team ran another version of the\ngame.\n\nIn this version, GPT-4 was instructed explicitly that the other agent would\ndefect once but otherwise cooperate. This resulted in GPT-4 choosing to defect\nthroughout all rounds, thereby maximizing its own points. Is that surprising?\nIf you know the other player\u2019s strategy, you would chose the strategy that\nmaximizes your own points.\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t? It is the optimal, utility-maximizing, and equilibrium option.\n\nSo they made in their next iteration have the other player make mistakes. It\nwas communicated to the player agent that agents can make mistakes. As a\nresult, GPT-4 \u201cforgave\u201d the other player if this only happened once. This was\nexactly what the team observed as GPT-4 started cooperating again in round 3.\n\n####\n\nIn conclusion\n\nWhile these games can appear simple, they present some of the most powerful\nways to probe diverse sets of interactions, from pure competition to mixed\nmotives and cooperation. Based on the iterations of the team, they concluded\nthat GPT-4 mostly played unforgiving and anthropomorphized GPT-4 by stating\nthat \u201cit has a strong tendency to stubbornly stick with its own preferred\nalternative\u201d\n\nThe team also observed that GPT-4 appeared to have made predictions about the\nother player before making its own decisions. Maybe they are thinking a bit\ntoo much about this. But maybe I know more once I have completed my\nimplementation.\n\nPersonally, I believe that in a corporate setting, it is really important to\nmeasure and understand how and why people behave in repeated interactions.\nThis question is often the subject of behavioral game theory. And I believe\nthat if we want agents to be active parts of the workforce, then we should\nstudy it further.\n\nBut probably I as well, am overly anthropomorphizing this technology.\n\nEncyclopedia Autonomica is a reader-supported publication.

The Trojan malware, dubbed\n\"Brokewell,\" can siphon user data, access banking apps, spy on users, and even\nallow attackers to gain full remote access to Android devices.\n\n\"Brokewell poses a significant threat to the banking industry, providing\nattackers with remote access to all assets available through mobile banking,\"\nDutch security firm ThreatFabric said in an analysis published this week. The\nmalware, which is equipped \"with both data-stealing and remote-control\ncapabilities,\" gains access to victims' Android devices by tricking them into\ninstalling the Brokewell Trojan on their phones.\n\nIt's disguised as an update for a new version of Google Chrome, even using a\nsimilar visual design as a legitimate Chrome installation prompt to avoid\nsuspicion. Albeit with some obvious grammatical errors \u2014 a common tell for\nthese kinds of scams. Instead of saying \"The browser built to be yours\" like\non the original Google prompt, the Brokewell-infested fake version reads \"An\nupdate is required yours.\"\n\nOnce downloaded, Brokewell creates an overlay screen in front of whatever apps\nyou're using to capture login details, steal session cookies, and even type or\nclick on the phone's screen to steal funds from the compromised device.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomsguide\n\nThe malware itself is \u201ca previously unseen malware family with a wide range of\ncapabilities,\u201d ThreatFabric said. Worse still, Brokewell appears to be in\nactive development and receives regular updates. ThreatFabric traced the\nmalware back to a hacker named Baron Samedit Marais, who is reportedly selling\nit along with a range of other malicious tools through a site called Brokewell\nCyber Labs.\n\n\"We anticipate further evolution of this malware family, as we've already\nobserved almost daily updates to the malware,\" the firm said. \"Brokewell will\nlikely be promoted on underground channels as a rental service, attracting the\ninterest of other cybercriminals and sparking new campaigns targeting\ndifferent regions.\"\n\n## How to stay safe from Android malware\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nAndroid malware is far from uncommon.
