It\ncame shortly after Spotify's acquisition of Chartable and Podsights. My idea\nwas to change from the traditional model. With the tools available today, I\nthink it's easier to create a reusable infrastructure for podcasts, and this\nprevents the misuse of listener data by private companies. Podcasters are just\nlooking to get reliable statistics on their audiences. With OP3 (Open Podcast\nPrefix Project), I envisioned a simple solution, offering public pages and\ninformation accessible to everyone in the podcast industry. OP3 is public,\nwhich is crucial as podcasting is known for its transparency. Unlike closed\nmusic platforms, we lack information on the popularity and trends of podcasts\nin different regions. OP3 aims to fill this gap by offering transparency\ncomparable to platforms like YouTube.\n\nBB: How does it work? JS: In terms of analytical standards, OP3 follows the\nIABv2 specification, but with a more rigorous approach to classifying bots and\nprocessing IP addresses. We use an open list for user agents (listening\nsoftware), updated in collaboration with the \u201cOpen Podcast Analytics Working\nGroup\u201d to ensure uniformity and reliability in our analyses. Furthermore, what\nwe do with OP3 can be easily replicated by others, as we have published the\nproject as open source. This means that everyone can view our code and\nunderstand our decisions. This is a unique approach in the industry and aims\nto build trust.\n\nBB: You collect data, is it sensitive? JS: In terms of compliance, especially\nwith GDPR, we have a minimal approach to data collection. IP addresses are the\nonly personal data handled, and they are immediately hashed. We use\nCloudflare's services for all data management, thus ensuring their security\nand confidentiality. All data transformations are visible in our code and are\nnever stored. In fact, as an administrator, I don't even have the ability to\nsee IP addresses, as they are not retained.\n\nBB: But the real novelty is making open data, right? JS: Yes, regarding the\nopen data aspect, I think one of the great assets of the Internet is the\necosystem it generates. As a podcaster, you can publish without asking\nanyone's permission. Similarly, data should be open to stimulate innovation.\nIf your podcasts are popular, it's better to demonstrate this with open and\naccessible data, allowing other players to add value to what you do. At OP3,\nwe apply this philosophy to both our podcasts and our data. Currently, OP3\nfocuses mainly on providing data to podcasters, then to podcast applications,\nand finally to the industry as a whole. The idea is not to allow the download\nof a complete database like PodcastIndex.org does, but to provide specific\nstatistics and analyses. Users can get data on specific podcasts if they know\ntheir URLs. We may consider making the data more widely available on a paid\nbasis in the future to support the project.\n\nBB: But are the data of a podcast free? JS: OP3 is free for podcasters and\noffers total transparency. The statistics of a podcast cannot be private; they\nare public by default. For a podcast's data to be available on OP3, it must\nalso be listed in PodcastIndex.org.\n\nBB: OP3 follows the IABv2 standard, is it certified? JS: Regarding IABv2\ncertification, although we follow their guidelines, certification is not our\npriority due to its high cost. While I'm not opposed to certification, it\nwould need to be financially viable.\n\nBB: Indeed, the OP3 servers have a cost, what is the business model? JS:\nConcerning the funding and viability of OP3, the goal is to minimize costs\nusing innovative infrastructure techniques. OP3 operates on a global CDN,\nmaking it very reliable. We accept support and receive contributions of $100\nto $500 per month. We currently manage about a thousand podcasts, but the goal\nis to increase this number. Infrastructure costs will increase slightly with\nexpansion, but we hope to maintain a sustainable model through sponsorship.\n\nBB: Can you tell us what OP3 has in store for the future? JS: Regarding the\ndevelopment of OP3, the goal is to improve integrations with podcast hosts and\nto make our service known to more podcasters. We are also looking to improve\nintegrations with third-party systems for better data management.\n\nBB: Thank you, John, for all these answers! A word to conclude? JS: I think\nthat the reliability of data in the podcast industry is a crucial issue. I am\nconvinced that the transparency and openness of OP3 contribute to a better\nunderstanding and improvement of the entire sector.\n\nIllustrations by Katerina Limpitsouni\n\n###\n\nBenjamin Bellamy\n\nPodcasts, e-commerce & open-source.
