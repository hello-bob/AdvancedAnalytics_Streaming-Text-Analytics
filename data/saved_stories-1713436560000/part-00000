Pulsed charging leads to significantly fewer\ncracks in the graphite and NMC particles. Also, the interface between the\nsolid electrode and the liquid electrolyte (SEI) is thinner and has a\ndifferent composition. \u00a9 HZB/10.1002/aenm.202400190\n\nAn improved charging protocol might help lithium-ion batteries to last much\nlonger. Charging with a high-frequency pulsed current reduces ageing effects,\nan international team demonstrated. The study was led by Philipp Adelhelm (HZB\nand Humboldt University) in collaboration with teams from the Technical\nUniversity of Berlin and Aalborg University in Denmark. Experiments at the\nX-ray source BESSY II were particularly revealing.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are powerful, and they are used everywhere, from\nelectric vehicles to electronic devices. However, their capacity gradually\ndecreases over the course of hundreds of charging cycles. The best commercial\nlithium-ion batteries with electrodes made of so-called NMC532 (molecular\nformula: LiNi_0.5Mn_0.3Co_0.2O_2) and graphite have a service life of up to\neight years. Batteries are usually charged with a constant current flow. But\nis this really the most favourable method? A new study by Prof Philipp\nAdelhelm's group at HZB and Humboldt-University Berlin answers this question\nclearly with no. The study in the journal Advanced Energy Materials analyses\nthe effect of the charging protocol on the service time of the battery.\n\n## Ageing effects analysed\n\nPart of the battery tests were carried out at Aalborg University. The\nbatteries were either charged conventionally with constant current (CC) or\nwith a new charging protocol with pulsed current (PC). Post-mortem analyses\nrevealed clear differences after several charging cycles: In the CC samples,\nthe solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at the anode was significantly thicker,\nwhich impaired the capacity. The team also found more cracks in the structure\nof the NMC532 and graphite electrodes, which also contributed to the loss of\ncapacity. In contrast, PC-charging led to a thinner SEI interface and fewer\nstructural changes in the electrode materials.\n\n## Synchrotron experiments at BESSY II and PETRA III\n\nHZB researcher Dr Yaolin Xu then led the investigation into the lithium-ion\ncells at Humboldt University and BESSY II with operando Raman spectroscopy and\ndilatometry as well as X-ray absorption spectroscopy to analyse what happens\nduring charging with different protocols. Supplementary experiments were\ncarried out at the PETRA III synchrotron. \"The pulsed current charging\npromotes the homogeneous distribution of the lithium ions in the graphite and\nthus reduces the mechanical stress and cracking of the graphite particles.\nThis improves the structural stability of the graphite anode,\" he concludes.\nThe pulsed charging also suppresses the structural changes of NMC532 cathode\nmaterials with less Ni-O bond length variation.\n\n## The pulse current frequency is crucial\n\nHowever, the frequency of the pulsed current counts: High-frequency PC\ncharging protocols with square-wave current extend the service life of\ncommercial LIBs the most, with a doubled cycle life (with 80% capacity\nretention) achieved in this study.\n\nar\u00f6\n\n## You might also be interested in\n\n  * Science Highlight\n\n17.04.2024\n\nA simpler way to inorganic perovskite solar cells\n\nInorganic perovskite solar cells made of CsPbI_3 are stable over the long term\nand achieve good efficiencies. A team led by Prof. Antonio Abate has now\nanalysed surfaces and interfaces of CsPbI_3 films, produced under different\nconditions, at BESSY II. The results show that annealing in ambient air does\nnot have an adverse effect on the optoelectronic properties of the\nsemiconductor film, but actually results in fewer defects. This could further\nsimplify the mass production of inorganic perovskite solar cells.\n\n  * Science Highlight\n\n16.04.2024\n\nSpintronics: A new path to room temperature swirling spin textures\n\nA team at HZB has investigated a new, simple method at BESSY II that can be\nused to create stable radial magnetic vortices in magnetic thin films.\n\n  * Science Highlight\n\n03.04.2024\n\nFuel Cells: Oxidation processes of phosphoric acid revealed by tender X-rays\n\nThe interactions between phosphoric acid and the platinum catalyst in high-\ntemperature PEM fuel cells are more complex than previously assumed.\nExperiments at BESSY II with tender X-rays have decoded the multiple oxidation\nprocesses at the platinum-electrolyte interface. The results indicate that\nvariations in humidity can influence some of these processes in order to\nincrease the lifetime and efficiency of fuel cells.\n\nNewsroom\n\n## Contact to the experts:\n\nCE-GOBA-office@helmholtz-berlin.de\n\nProf. Dr. Philipp Adelhelm Email\n\n## Press Officer:\n\nDr. Antonia R\u00f6tger (030) 8062 - 43733 Email\n\nAdvanced Energy Materials (2024): Unravelling the Mechanism of Pulse Current\nCharging for Enhancing the Stability of Commercial\nLiNi_0.5Mn_0.3Co_0.2O_2/Graphite Lithium-Ion Batteries\n\nJia Guo, Yaolin Xu, Moritz Exner, Xinrong Huang, Yongchun Li, Yanchen Liu, Hui\nWang, Julia Kowal, Qi Zhang, Peter Kj\u00e6r Kristensen, Deyong Wang, Kjeld\nPedersen, Leonid Gurevich, Daniel-Ioan Stroe, Philipp Adelhelm\n\nDOI: 10.1002/aenm.202400190\n\n# Footer\n\n  * Contact\n  * Imprint\n  * Data protection\n  * Leichte Sprache (ger)\n  * Barrierefreiheit (ger)\n  * Newsletter\n\n  * ## The HZB in brief\n\n    * About us\n    * What we stand for\n    * Media library\n    * HZB-Zeitung \u201elichtblick\u201c (German)\n    * Press Releases\n    * Events\n  * ## Training and Vacancies\n\n    * Job opportunities\n    * Training and studies\n    * School and study\n    * PhD Students\n    * Postdocs\n\n## Postal address\n\nHelmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f\u00fcr Materialien und Energie Hahn-Meitner-Platz 1\n14109 Berlin Germany Fon: +49 30 8062 - 0\n\nContact form Locations\n\n## HZB Social Media\n\n", "frontpage": false}
