Most Americans retire far earlier \u2014 and not by\nchoice.\n\nBy Aimee Picchi\n\nEdited By Anne Marie Lee\n\nApril 26, 2024 / 4:51 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nHow to save enough for retirement\n\nHow to save enough for retirement 02:57\n\nAmerican workers by and large believe they'll retire at 65, the nation's\ntraditional retirement age. But real life often gets in the way of those\nplans, with new research finding that the majority actually step back from\nwork far earlier. And for many, it's not by choice.\n\nThe median retirement age for Americans is actually 62, meaning that the\ntypical worker is stepping back from their career three years earlier than\nexpected, according to new research from the Employee Benefit Research\nInstitute, a nonprofit focused on employee benefit programs.\n\nThe findings underscore the gap between retirement goals and reality. One\nincreasingly popular idea, often promoted by lawmakers and business leaders,\nis that Americans should work longer so they can better afford their golden\nyears. Because millions of workers are woefully lacking in retirement savings,\nworking longer is seen as a way to solve their funding gap. In reality,\nhowever, many U.S. seniors are forced into retirement before they're ready.\n\nBut even when people want to work longer, they're not always able to, the new\nresearch found.\n\n\"It's hard to make that case that everyone should work longer and that will\nsolve the problems we have in retirement,\" Craig Copeland, director of wealth\nbenefits research at EBRI, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That clearly won't solve all\nthe problems because many people just can't do it.\"\n\nSeven in 10 retirees stopped working before they turned 65, the report found.\nOverall, about half said they stopped working before they had expected, with\nthe majority blaming reasons out of their control. For instance, about one-\nthird cited a health issue or disability for their earlier-than-expected\nretirement.\n\nOnly about 2 in 5 said they stopped working earlier than expected because they\ncould afford to do so, the research found.\n\nWithin that gap between expectations and reality lies the potential for some\ntroubling outcomes. For instance, workers who plan to retire at 65, but are\nforced to stop working years earlier, might not have enough saved.\n\nAlready, many older Americans lack any retirement savings, with a new AARP\nstudy finding that 1 in 5 people over 50 have nothing saved for their old age.\n\n## Needed: $1.5 million\n\nThe new EBRI study, which polled 1,255 workers and 1,266 retirees in January,\nfound that only about half of workers have calculated how much money they'll\nneed in retirement. Of those who examined their financial retirement goals,\nabout one-third believe they'll require at least $1.5 million, EBRI found.\n\nThat jibes with other research that found the typical worker believes they'll\nneed $1.46 million to retire comfortably. But in reality, most Americans have\nfar less, with EBRI noting that about one-third of workers currently have less\nthan $50,000 in savings and investments.\n\nAmericans may be picking big numbers because of the rule of thumb that you\nshould have about 10 times your salary saved for retirement, Copeland noted.\n\n\"So if you are making $100,000 or $150,000, $1.5 million is a simple\ncalculation to get you there,\" he noted. \"They are realistic in what they\nneed, but I'm not sure they are realistic in what they need to save to reach\nthat number, and that's the issue.\"\n\nAt the same time, most workers expect Social Security will be a source of\nincome in retirement, EBRI found, even as the benefits program is set to face\na funding shortfall in less than a decade. If Social Security isn't shored up\nby 2033, retirees could face an across-the-board benefits cut of more than\n20%, a worrying issue for workers without much saved for retirement.\n\nEven so, current retirees overall are optimistic about their lives, with EBRI\nfinding that two-thirds said they are living the retirement life they\nenvisioned.\n\n\"It's pretty positive overall,\" Copeland said. \"But getting there can be a\nstressful situation.\"\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nHere's how much income it takes to be considered rich in your state\n\n\"Vampire facials\" at unlicensed spa infected 3 with HIV, CDC says\n\nHere's how much credit card debt the average American has (and how to pay it\noff)\n\nWhy U.S. officials want to ban TikTok\n\nIn:\n\n  * Social Security\n\nAimee Picchi\n\nAimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she\ncovers business and personal finance.
