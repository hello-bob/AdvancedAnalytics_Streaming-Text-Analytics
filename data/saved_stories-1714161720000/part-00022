So it\u2019s a little strange\nhow I\u2019ve ended up now\u2014someone who dances daily with triple integrals, Fourier\ntransforms, and that crown jewel of mathematics, Euler\u2019s equation. It\u2019s hard\nto believe I\u2019ve flipped from a virtually congenital math-phobe to a professor\nof engineering.\n\nOne day, one of my students asked me how I did it\u2014how I changed my brain. I\nwanted to answer Hell\u2014with lots of difficulty! After all, I\u2019d flunked my way\nthrough elementary, middle, and high school math and science. In fact, I\ndidn\u2019t start studying remedial math until I left the Army at age 26. If there\nwere a textbook example of the potential for adult neural plasticity, I\u2019d be\nExhibit A.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nLearning math and then science as an adult gave me passage into the empowering\nworld of engineering. But these hard-won, adult-age changes in my brain have\nalso given me an insider\u2019s perspective on the neuroplasticity that underlies\nadult learning. Fortunately, my doctoral training in systems engineering\u2014tying\ntogether the big picture of different STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,\nMath) disciplines\u2014and then my later research and writing focusing on how\nhumans think have helped me make sense of recent advances in neuroscience and\ncognitive psychology related to learning.\n\nIn the years since I received my doctorate, thousands of students have swept\nthrough my classrooms\u2014students who have been reared in elementary school and\nhigh school to believe that understanding math through active discussion is\nthe talisman of learning. If you can explain what you\u2019ve learned to others,\nperhaps drawing them a picture, the thinking goes, you must understand it.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nJapan has become seen as a much-admired and emulated exemplar of these active,\n\u201cunderstanding-centered\u201d teaching methods. But what\u2019s often missing from the\ndiscussion is the rest of the story: Japan is also home of the Kumon method of\nteaching mathematics, which emphasizes memorization, repetition, and rote\nlearning hand-in-hand with developing the child\u2019s mastery over the material.\nThis intense afterschool program, and others like it, is embraced by millions\nof parents in Japan and around the world who supplement their child\u2019s\nparticipatory education with plenty of practice, repetition, and yes,\nintelligently designed rote learning, to allow them to gain hard-won fluency\nwith the material.\n\n> Teachers can inadvertently set their students up for failure as those\n> students blunder in illusions of competence.\n\nIn the United States, the emphasis on understanding sometimes seems to have\nreplaced rather than complemented older teaching methods that scientists\nare\u2014and have been\u2014telling us work with the brain\u2019s natural process to learn\ncomplex subjects like math and science.\n\nThe latest wave in educational reform in mathematics involves the Common\nCore\u2014an attempt to set strong, uniform standards across the U.S., although\ncritics are weighing in to say the standards fail by comparison with high-\nachieving countries. At least superficially, the standards seem to show a\nsensible perspective. They propose that in mathematics, students should gain\nequal facility in conceptual understanding, procedural skills and fluency, and\napplication.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe devil, of course, lies in the details of implementation. In the current\neducational climate, memorization and repetition in the STEM disciplines (as\nopposed to in the study of language or music), are often seen as demeaning and\na waste of time for students and teachers alike. Many teachers have long been\ntaught that conceptual understanding in STEM trumps everything else. And\nindeed, it\u2019s easier for teachers to induce students to discuss a mathematical\nsubject (which, if done properly, can do much to help promote understanding)\nthan it is for that teacher to tediously grade math homework. What this all\nmeans is that, despite the fact that procedural skills and fluency, along with\napplication, are supposed to be given equal emphasis with conceptual\nunderstanding, all too often it doesn\u2019t happen. Imparting a conceptual\nunderstanding reigns supreme\u2014especially during precious class time.\n\nThe problem with focusing relentlessly on understanding is that math and\nscience students can often grasp essentials of an important idea, but this\nunderstanding can quickly slip away without consolidation through practice and\nrepetition. Worse, students often believe they understand something when, in\nfact, they don\u2019t. By championing the importance of understanding, teachers can\ninadvertently set their students up for failure as those students blunder in\nillusions of competence. As one (failing) engineering student recently told\nme: \u201cI just don\u2019t see how I could have done so poorly. I understood it when\nyou taught it in class.\u201d My student may have thought he\u2019d understood it at the\ntime, and perhaps he did, but he\u2019d never practiced using the concept to truly\ninternalize it. He had not developed any kind of procedural fluency or ability\nto apply what he thought he understood.\n\nThere is an interesting connection between learning math and science, and\nlearning a sport. When you learn how to swing a golf club, you perfect that\nswing from lots of repetition over a period of years. Your body knows what to\ndo from a single thought\u2014one chunk\u2014instead of having to recall all the complex\nsteps involved in hitting a ball.\n\nIn the same way, once you understand why you do something in math and science,\nyou don\u2019t have to keep re-explaining the how to yourself every time you do it.\nIt\u2019s not necessary to go around with 25 marbles in your pocket and lay out 5\nrows of 5 marbles again and again so that you get that 5 x 5 = 25. At some\npoint, you just know it fluently from memory. You memorize the idea that you\nsimply add exponents\u2014those little superscript numbers\u2014when multiplying numbers\nthat have the same base (10^4 x 10^5 = 10^9). If you use the procedure a lot,\nby doing many different types of problems, you will find that you understand\nboth the why and the how behind the procedure very well indeed. The greater\nunderstanding results from the fact that your mind constructed the patterns of\nmeaning. Continually focusing on understanding itself actually gets in the\nway.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

So I launched directly from high school into the Army. I had\nloved learning new languages in high school, and the Army seemed to be a place\nwhere people could actually get paid for their language study, even as they\nattended the top-ranked Defense Language Institute\u2014a place that had made\nlanguage- learning a science. I chose Russian because it was very different\nfrom English, but not so difficult that I could study it for a lifetime only\nto perhaps gain the fluency of a 4-year-old. Besides, the Iron Curtain was\nmysteriously appealing\u2014could I somehow use my knowledge of Russian to peer\nbehind it?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Working for the Russians was fun and\nengrossing\u2014but it was also a superficially glamorous form of migrant work. You\ngo to sea during fishing season, make a decent salary while getting drunk all\nthe time, then go back to port when the season\u2019s over and hope they\u2019ll rehire\nyou next year. There was pretty much only one other alternative for a Russian\nlanguage speaker\u2014working for the National Security Agency. (My Army contacts\nkept pointing me that way, but it wasn\u2019t for me.)\n\nI began to realize that while knowing another language was nice, it was also a\nskill with limited opportunities and potential. People weren\u2019t pounding down\nmy door looking for my Russian declension abilities. Unless, that is, I was\nwilling to put up with seasickness and sporadic malnutrition out on stinking\ntrawlers in the middle of the Bering Sea. I couldn\u2019t help but reflect back on\nthe West Point-trained engineers I\u2019d worked with in the Army. Their\nmathematically and scientifically based approach to problem-solving was\nclearly useful for the real world\u2014far more useful than my youthful\nmisadventures with math had been able to imagine.\n\nSo, at age 26, as I was leaving the Army and casting about for fresh\nopportunities, it occurred to me: If I really wanted to try something new, why\nnot tackle something that could open a whole world of new perspectives for me?\nSomething like engineering? That meant I would be trying to learn another very\ndifferent language\u2014the language of calculus.\n\n> You go to sea during fishing season, make a decent salary while getting\n> drunk all the time, then go back to port when the season\u2019s over.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

This was\nway below mathematical ground zero for most college students. Trying to\nreprogram my brain sometimes seemed like a ridiculous idea\u2014especially when I\nlooked at the fresh young faces of my younger classmates and realized that\nmany of them had already dropped their hard math and science classes\u2014and here\nI was heading right for them. But in my case, from my experience becoming\nfluent in Russian as an adult, I suspected\u2014or maybe I just hoped\u2014that there\nmight be aspects to language learning that I might apply to learning in math\nand science.\n\nWhat I had done in learning Russian was to emphasize not just understanding of\nthe language, but fluency. Fluency of something whole like a language requires\na kind of familiarity that only repeated and varied interaction with the parts\ncan develop. Where my language classmates had often been content to\nconcentrate on simply understanding Russian they heard or read, I instead\ntried to gain an internalized, deep-rooted fluency with the words and language\nstructure. I wouldn\u2019t just be satisfied to know that \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c meant \u201cto\nunderstand.\u201d I\u2019d practice with the verb\u2014putting it through its paces by\nconjugating it repeatedly with all sorts of tenses, and then moving on to\nputting it into sentences, and then finally to understanding not only when to\nuse this form of the verb, but also when not to use it. I practiced recalling\nall these aspects and variations quickly. After all, through practice, you can\nunderstand and translate dozens\u2014even thousands\u2014 of words in another language.\nBut if you aren\u2019t fluent, when someone throws a bunch of words at you quickly,\nas with normal speaking (which always sounds horrifically fast when you\u2019re\nlearning a new language), you have no idea what they\u2019re actually saying, even\nthough technically you understand all the component words and structure. And\nyou certainly can\u2019t speak quickly enough yourself for native speakers to find\nit enjoyable to listen to you.\n\nThis approach\u2014which focused on fluency instead of simple understanding\u2014put me\nat the top of the class. And I didn\u2019t realize it then, but this approach to\nlearning language had given me an intuitive understanding of a fundamental\ncore of learning and the development of expertise\u2014chunking.\n\nChunking was originally conceptualized in the groundbreaking work of Herbert\nSimon in his analysis of chess\u2014chunks were envisioned as the varying neural\ncounterparts of different chess patterns. Gradually, neuroscientists came to\nrealize that experts such as chess grand masters are experts because they have\nstored thousands of chunks of knowledge about their area of expertise in their\nlong-term memory. Chess masters, for example, can recall tens of thousands of\ndifferent chess patterns. Whatever the discipline, experts can call up to\nconsciousness one or several of these well-knit-together, chunked neural\nsubroutines to analyze and react to a new learning situation. This level of\ntrue understanding, and ability to use that understanding in new situations,\ncomes only with the kind of rigor and familiarity that repetition,\nmemorization, and practice can foster.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAs studies of chess masters, emergency room physicians, and fighter pilots\nhave shown, in times of critical stress, conscious analysis of a situation is\nreplaced by quick, subconscious processing as these experts rapidly draw on\ntheir deeply ingrained repertoire of neural subroutines\u2014chunks. At some point,\nself-consciously \u201cunderstanding\u201d why you do what you do just slows you down\nand interrupts flow, resulting in worse decisions. When I felt intuitively\nthat there might be a connection between learning a new language and learning\nmathematics, I was right. Day-by-day, sustained practice of Russian fired and\nwired together my neural circuits, and I gradually began to knit together\nchunks of Slavic insight that I could call into working memory with ease. By\ninterleaving my learning\u2014in other words, practicing so that I knew not only\nwhen to use that word, but when not to use it, or to use a different variant\nof it\u2014I was actually using the same approaches that expert practitioners use\nto learn in math and science.\n\nWhen learning math and engineering as an adult, I began by using the same\nstrategy I\u2019d used to learn language. I\u2019d look at an equation, to take a very\nsimple example, Newton\u2019s second law of f = ma. I practiced feeling what each\nof the letters meant\u2014f for force was a push, m for mass was a kind of weighty\nresistance to my push, and a was the exhilarating feeling of acceleration.\n(The equivalent in Russian was learning to physically sound out the letters of\nthe Cyrillic alphabet.) I memorized the equation so I could carry it around\nwith me in my head and play with it. If m and a were big numbers, what did\nthat do to f when I pushed it through the equation? If f was big and a was\nsmall, what did that do to m? How did the units match on each side? Playing\nwith the equation was like conjugating a verb. I was beginning to intuit that\nthe sparse outlines of the equation were like a metaphorical poem, with all\nsorts of beautiful symbolic representations embedded within it. Although I\nwouldn\u2019t have put it that way at the time, the truth was that to learn math\nand science well, I had to slowly, day by day, build solid neural \u201cchunked\u201d\nsubroutines\u2014such as surrounding the simple equation f = ma\u2014that I could easily\ncall to mind from long term memory, much as I\u2019d done with Russian.\n\nTime after time, professors in mathematics and the sciences have told me that\nbuilding well-ingrained chunks of expertise through practice and repetition\nwas absolutely vital to their success. Understanding doesn\u2019t build fluency;\ninstead, fluency builds understanding. In fact, I believe that true\nunderstanding of a complex subject comes only from fluency.\n\nIn other words, in science and math education in particular, it\u2019s easy to slip\ninto teaching methods that emphasize understanding and that avoid the\nsometimes painful repetition and practice that underlie fluency. I learned\nRussian not just by understanding it\u2014understanding, after all, is facile, and\ncan easily slip away. (What did that word \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c mean?) I learned Russian by\ngaining fluency through practice, repetition, and rote learning\u2014but rote\nlearning that emphasized the ability to think flexibly and quickly. I learned\nmath and science by applying precisely those same ideas. Language, math, and\nscience, as with almost all areas of human expertise, draw on the same\nreservoir of brain mechanisms.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

But 25 years\nafter I\u2019d last raised an inebriated glass on the Soviet trawlers, my family\nand I decided to take the trans-Siberian railway across Russia. Although I was\nexcited to take the long-dreamed-of trip, I was also worried. I\u2019d barely\nuttered a word of Russian in all that time. What if I\u2019d lost it all? What had\nthose years of gaining fluency really bought me?\n\nSure enough, when we first got on the train, I spoke Russian like a 2-year-\nold. I\u2019d grasp for words, my declensions and conjugations were all wrong, and\nmy formerly near-perfect accent sounded dreadful. But the foundation was\nthere, and day by day, my Russian improved. And even with my rudimentary\nRussian, I could handle the day-to-day needs of our traveling. Soon, tour\nguides were coming to me for help translating for the other passengers. When\nwe finally arrived in Moscow, we hopped in a taxi. The driver, I soon\ndiscovered, was intent on ripping us off\u2014heading directly the wrong way and\ntrapping us in a logjam of cars, where he expected us ignorant foreigners to\nquietly acquiesce to an unnecessary extra hour of meter time. Suddenly,\nRussian words I hadn\u2019t spoken for decades flew from my mouth. I hadn\u2019t even\nconsciously known I knew those words.\n\nUnderneath it all, when it was needed, the fluency was there\u2014and it quickly\ngot us out of trouble (and into another taxi). Fluency allows understanding to\nbecome embedded, emerging when needed.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

As parents and teachers, we can use simple, accessible methods\nfor deepening understanding and making it useful and flexible. We can\nencourage others and ourselves to try new disciplines that we thought were too\nhard\u2014math, dance, physics, language, chemistry, music\u2014opening new worlds for\nourselves and others.\n\nAs I discovered, having a basic, deep-seated fluency in math and science\u2014not\njust an \u201cunderstanding,\u201d is critical. It opens doors for many of life\u2019s most\nintriguing jobs. Looking back, I realize that I didn\u2019t have to just blindly\nfollow my initial inclinations and passions. The \u201cfluency\u201d part of me that\nloved literature and language was also the same part of me that ultimately\nfell in love with math and science\u2014and transformed and enriched my life.\n\nBarbara Oakley is a professor of engineering at Oakland University, Rochester,\nMichigan, and the author of, most recently, A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel\nat Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra).
