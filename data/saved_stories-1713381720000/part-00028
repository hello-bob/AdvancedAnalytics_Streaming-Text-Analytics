The team is the first to successfully reproduce the\nunusual shape with numerical simulations, attributing it to a giant and slow\noblique-angle impact.\n\nEver since the cameras of NASA's New Horizons mission discovered a large\nheart-shaped structure on the surface of the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015, this\n\"heart\" has puzzled scientists because of its unique shape, geological\ncomposition, and elevation. A team of scientists from the University of Bern,\nincluding several members of the NCCR PlanetS, and the University of Arizona\nin Tucson have used numerical simulations to investigate the origins of\nSputnik Planitia, the western teardrop-shaped part of Plutos heart surface\nfeature.\n\nAccording to their research, Pluto's early history was marked by a cataclysmic\nevent that formed Sputnik Planitia: a collision with a planetary body about\n700 km in diameter, roughly twice the size of Switzerland from east to west.\nThe team's findings, which were recently published in Nature Astronomy, also\nsuggest that the inner structure of Pluto is different from what was\npreviously assumed, indicating that there is no subsurface ocean.\n\n## A divided heart\n\nThe heart, also known as the Tombaugh Regio, captured the public's attention\nimmediately upon its discovery. But it also immediately caught the interest of\nscientists because it is covered in a high-albedo material that reflects more\nlight than its surroundings, creating its whiter color.\n\nHowever, the heart is not composed of a single element. Sputnik Planitia (the\nwestern part) covers an area of 1,200 by 2,000 kilometers, which is equivalent\nto a quarter of Europe or the United States. What is striking, however, is\nthat this region is three to four kilometers lower in elevation than most of\nPluto's surface.\n\n\"The bright appearance of Sputnik Planitia is due to it being predominantly\nfilled with white nitrogen ice that moves and convects to constantly smooth\nout the surface. This nitrogen most likely accumulated quickly after the\nimpact due to the lower altitude,\" explains Dr. Harry Ballantyne from the\nUniversity of Bern, lead author of the study.\n\nThe eastern part of the heart is also covered by a similar but much thinner\nlayer of nitrogen ice, the origin of which is still unclear to scientists, but\nis probably related to Sputnik Planitia.\n\nArtistic representation of the huge and slow impact on Pluto that led to the\nheart-shaped structure on its surface.

These simulations confirmed the\nscientists' suspicions about the oblique angle of impact and determined the\ncomposition of the impactor.\n\n\"Pluto's core is so cold that the rocks remained very hard and did not melt\ndespite the heat of the impact, and thanks to the angle of impact and the low\nvelocity, the core of the impactor did not sink into Pluto's core, but\nremained intact as a splat on it,\" explains Ballantyne.\n\n\"Somewhere beneath Sputnik is the remnant core of another massive body, that\nPluto never quite digested,\" adds co-author Erik Asphaug from the University\nof Arizona. This core strength and relatively low velocity were key to the\nsuccess of these simulations: lower strength would result in a very\nsymmetrical leftover surface feature that does not look like the teardrop\nshape observed by New Horizons.\n\n\"We are used to thinking of planetary collisions as incredibly intense events\nwhere you can ignore the details except for things like energy, momentum and\ndensity. But in the distant solar system, velocities are so much slower, and\nsolid ice is strong, so you have to be much more precise in your calculations.\nThat's where the fun starts,\" says Asphaug.\n\nThe two teams have a long record of collaborations together, exploring since\n2011 already the idea of planetary \"splats\" to explain, for instance, features\non the far side of the moon. After our moon and Pluto, the University of Bern\nteam plans to explore similar scenarios for other outer solar system bodies\nsuch as the Pluto-like dwarf planet Haumea.\n\n## No subsurface ocean on Pluto\n\nThe current study sheds new light on Pluto's internal structure as well. In\nfact, a giant impact like the one simulated is much more likely to have\noccurred very early in Pluto's history. However, this poses a problem: a giant\ndepression like Sputnik Planitia is expected to slowly move toward the pole of\nthe dwarf planet over time due to the laws of physics, since it has a mass\ndeficit. Yet it is paradoxically near the equator.\n\nThe previous theorized explanation was that Pluto, like several other\nplanetary bodies in the outer solar system, has a subsurface liquid water\nocean. According to this previous explanation, Pluto's icy crust would be\nthinner in the Sputnik Planitia region, causing the ocean to bulge there, and\nsince liquid water is denser than ice, you would end up with a mass surplus\nthat induces migration toward the equator.\n\nHowever, the new study offers an alternative perspective. \"In our simulations,\nall of Pluto's primordial mantle is excavated by the impact, and as the\nimpactor's core material splats onto Pluto's core, it creates a local mass\nexcess that can explain the migration toward the equator without a subsurface\nocean, or at most a very thin one,\" explains Martin Jutzi.\n\nDr. Adeene Denton from the University of Arizona, also co-author of the study,\nis currently conducting a new research project to estimate the speed of this\nmigration. \"This novel and inventive origin for Pluto's heart-shaped feature\nmay lead to a better understanding of Pluto's origin,\" she concludes.\n\nMore information: Harry A.
