We manually audit the quality of 205 language-specific corpora\n> released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix,\n> OSCAR, mC4). Lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: At least 15\n> corpora have no usable text, and a significant fraction contains less than\n> 50% sentences of acceptable quality. In addition, many are mislabeled or use\n> nonstandard/ambiguous language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are\n> easy to detect even for non-proficient speakers, and supplement the human\n> audit with automatic analyses. Finally, we recommend techniques to evaluate\n> and improve multilingual corpora and discuss potential risks that come with\n> low-quality data releases.\n\nComments:| Accepted at TACL; pre-MIT Press publication version  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2103.12028 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2103.12028v4 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.12028arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \nJournal reference:| Transactions of the Association for Computational\nLinguistics (2022) 10: 50-72  \nRelated DOI:| https://doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00447DOI(s) linking to related\nresources  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Pedro Ortiz Suarez [view email] [v1] Mon, 22 Mar 2021 17:30:33 UTC\n(5,337 KB) [v2] Fri, 23 Apr 2021 19:38:25 UTC (5,328 KB) [v3] Mon, 25 Oct 2021\n21:15:29 UTC (6,042 KB) [v4] Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:41:38 UTC (6,042 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Quality at a Glance: An Audit of Web-Crawled\nMultilingual Datasets, by Julia Kreutzer and 51 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2103\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### DBLP - CS Bibliography\n\nlisting | bibtex\n\nIsaac Caswell Julia Kreutzer Daan van Esch Nishant Subramani Artem Sokolov\n\n...\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
