Some players have threatened to quit the game over the issue,\nwith others demanding a refund.\n\nConfusingly, the FAQ section of Sony's support page appears to contradict this\nnew requirement. Sony asks: \"Do I have to sign in to PSN to play a PlayStation\ngame on PC?\" And it replies: \"Signing in to PSN is optional when playing a\nPlayStation game on PC.\"\n\nClearly, when it comes to Helldivers 2, the rules have changed.\n\nORIGINAL STORY: Sony has sparked a backlash after announcing plans to force\nHelldivers 2 Steam players to connect to a PlayStation Network account.\n\nIn a statement attributed to Sony Interactive Entertainment, the PlayStation\nmaker said that due to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d at the launch of Helldivers 2, it\nallowed the linking requirements for Steam accounts to a PlayStation Network\naccount to be temporarily optional. Sony said this \u201cgrace period\u201d will now\nexpire.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen: on May 6, all new Helldivers 2 players on Steam\nwill be required to connect their Steam account to a PlayStation Network\naccount. Current players on Steam will start to see the mandatory login from\nMay 30 and will be required to have linked a Steam and PlayStation Network\naccount by June 4.\n\nWhy is Sony forcing this requirement upon Steam players? Safety and security,\nit said. \u201cAccount linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and\nupholding the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and\nPlayStation Studios games,\u201d Sony said in its statement. \u201cThis is our main way\nto protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players\nthat engage in that type of behavior. It also allows those players that have\nbeen banned the right to appeal.\u201d\n\nPerhaps bracing itself for a backlash it knew was to come, Sony said: \u201cWe\nunderstand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step\nwill help us to continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a\npart of.\n\n\u201cMany thanks for your continued support of Helldivers 2!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that PC gamers who play Helldivers 2 on Steam and have\nnothing to do with Sony or PlayStation are upset by the decision. Many are\nsaying they had no idea that playing Helldivers 2 on Steam without linking to\na PlayStation account was part of a \u201cgrace period\u201d. As has been pointed out,\nHelldivers 2 launched with this requirement, but it was removed after the game\nexploded with popularity and the servers collapsed. Still, that hasn\u2019t\nprevented Steam players from hitting out at Sony for adding the requirement in\nnow, three months after launch.\n\n> I assume you did not read this when you launched the game then\n> pic.twitter.com/P2QRwBaYtp\u2014 PhineasJack (@PhineasJack67) May 3, 2024\n\nOthers are expressing concern about PlayStation Network security, given's\nSony's track record with data breaches. Some are now wondering what happens to\nHelldivers 2 Steam players who live in a country in which PSN is unavailable.\nSome of the more upset Steam players are threatening to abandon the game or\neven request a refund over the issue, although it remains to be seen whether\nSony\u2019s move will meaningfully affect Helldivers 2\u2019s Steam concurrent player\nnumbers, which Valve makes public.\n\n> Not happening.\n>\n> Removing access from Steam players unless they make a PSN account and link\n> it months after release is absurd. Review changed to negative and I have\n> filed for a refund. pic.twitter.com/xMVQUR3tLq\u2014 Pirate Software\n> (@PirateSoftware) May 3, 2024\n\n\"I paid $40 for this game and got well over 100 hours of fun out of it,\nabsolutely got my money\u2019s worth,\" redditor dudeitsivan said. \"Some of the most\nfun I\u2019ve had playing video games in as long as I remember. I\u2019ll miss the game\nlike crazy. But I will not be making a PS account.\n\n\"As much as I hate my own sentiment on this, I hope this kills player count.\nIt\u2019ll be the only thing that will make Sony reconsider.\"\n\n\"It sucks,\" added DarthArcanus. \"Arrowhead devs seem awesome. The game is\nawesome. But I won't support this. Period. I'll move onto other games. May not\nscratch the itch Helldivers did, but there's always something new.\"\n\n\"Just adding to say I'll do the same,\" commented stupherz. \"Was going to spend\nmoney to get the new Warbond too but guess not anymore. Was fun but I refuse\nto tolerate this out of principle.\"\n\nArrowhead community managers are currently putting out fires across the\nHelldivers Discord, which is packed with comments about today\u2019s announcement.\nResponding to one player who asked the very reasonable question how this makes\nHelldivers 2 safer, community manager Baskinator explained: \u201cSony has a\ndedicated team, a ban appeal process, and tools to take action on player\nreports, and it's all connected to having a PSN ID.\u201d In another post,\nBaskinator added: \"It's [Helldivers] Sony's IP, so it makes sense they'd want\nto use the tools they've developed for these things.\"\n\nReplying to a user who said they felt they had the rug pulled out from under\nthem, Baskinator said: \"Well, we always knew this day would get here, and it's\ngoing about how I expected. ? I'm actually happy for us to be able to take\naction against player reports and make the game safer across the board,\npersonally.\"\n\nHelldivers 2 is Sony\u2019s biggest ever launch on PC, and Steam players make up a\nsignificant chunk of the overall player base. It\u2019s one of the surprise smash\nhits of 2024, in part because of its launch on PS5 and PC at the same time,\nwith cross-play in full effect. Arrowhead has won plaudits for its community\nmanagement and the Helldivers 2 live service, with the early days server\ntroubles now a distant memory. But this announcement from Sony looks set to\ntest the loyalty of Helldivers 2\u2019s most hardcore fans.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
