Tensions between contributors are high, tensions between\nnon-contributors are high. There is no joy in such an environment. Within the\nlast calendar year, problems bubbling beneath the surface have boiled over,\nbreaching the previously restricted confines of individual conversations or\none-off occurrences in chat rooms. Something needs to change, or so it would\nseem, unless the current dismal state of affairs is intended to persist. What,\nthen, should change? Who will drive this change forward? And, perhaps most\nimportantly, how can history be stopped from repeating itself.\n\n## Landscape\n\nNix, for the longest time, has operated organically. That is to say, rules and\ndirection have only been constructed or provided once absolutely necessary.\nThe growth of the project is beyond what one, two, or ten could manage on\ntheir own. As such, a bureaucratic body, the NixOS Foundation, was enshrined\nas the entity which would oversee legal requirements for the project as well\nas provide direction. This north star, however, was dim at best and misleading\nat worst. The lacking power, or described more bluntly, backbone, of the\nfoundation has left it appealing to few. The entity is intended to provide\noversight of Nix and its related projects, but has appeared to mostly be a\nvehicle for advertisement or legitimization of the businesses its members\noperate.\n\nNixPkgs has operated in much the same way as previously described. Natural\ngrowth is difficult and, throughout the accumulation of hundreds of thousands\nof packages, the project certainly has its share of scars. Importantly, the\npackage repository sees a much larger pool of contributors and interaction\nthan Nix itself does. The ad-hoc structure of maintainers here better\nrepresent the goals of Nix users and their methods of success. Yet, these\ncontributors are beginning to flee.\n\nThe work being done for Nix and its surrounding official projects is difficult\nto map. A series of \u201cteams\u201d, ranging from security to moderation exist to\ncompartmentalize the many processes and fulfill the requirements of Nix\nprojects. Paradoxically, these teams are hardly more empowered than any other\nindividual contributor, only benefiting from more direct modes of\ncommunication and name recognition. The management of projects and features is\nstill wildly ad-hoc and limited significantly by the volunteer nature of these\ncontributors. Frequent re-litigation of well-discussed issues for one's ego,\nrejection of reasonable contributions in rejection of a healthy ecosystem, and\nthinly-veiled hostility is a staple of the Nix landscape despite many refusing\nto admit such.\n\n## Leadership\n\nPut simply and plainly, Nix has none. The only entity asserting its official\nstatus as the central figure of Nix refuses to fulfill this position. Frequent\ninaction, unsatisfactory action, and a general disconnection from the entirety\nof the Nix community and ecosystem seem to be pervasive within the NixOS\nFoundation. Lacking the conviction to decide, fully, the direction of Nix for\nthe entire ecosystem leaves the many corners of the community to construct\ntheir own interpretations. This model is not compatible with the current\nstructure of Nix projects. Rather, the current boys-club of a foundation\ncontinues to stifle any natural ownership that contributors would develop for\nthe many projects they provide value to.\n\nThe figures at the helm deserve assessment and scrutiny for, without their\ndecisions, this current set of circumstances would not have precipitated. Yet,\nmalice should not be attributed directly to these individuals, if only for\nnaivety. The NixOS Foundation was not created to become a body of inaction or\ndivisiveness, and, its members do not participate for want of division within\nthe community. Building Nix, NixOS, and all of the related tooling is still\nthe fundamental desire of everyone involved. For fear of detracting any\nfurther, it must be said that these people are just that: people. Treat them\nas such.\n\nShould Nix survive its current cataclysm, a democratic future may present\nitself. Many of the troubles of today arise from a disconnect between the\nfoundation members and the many Nix teams, contributors, and users. Providing\nthese groups with methods for action may allow for the avoidance of such a\nproblem recurring.\n\n## Community\n\nCommunities are comprised of the many. The Nix community is no exception.\nThere is no single archetype which overlays cleanly upon every member. The\nmyriad members express different beliefs and values, many of which are\ndiametrically opposed. Many of these can be avoided or understood as\nunnecessary territory, but it is inevitable for disagreements to form and\ntensions with them. The actions within the Nix sphere have invoked such a\ndisagreement, proving it had been put off for far too long. One subset of said\ncommunity believes in valuing the impact their actions have upon others.\nAnother subset believes willful ignorance towards the effects of their actions\nis acceptable. One cannot compromise the two views.\n\nThe solution, however, is not one of compromise, but one of direction.\nFundamentally, the community must be provided clear direction of Nix and its\nprojects. Either it will be a project of conscientious action or one of\nignorance. The limbo within which the issue currently sits is not sustainable.\nSuch a decision must be made and must be done so clearly and directly.\nRefusing to do so has and will continue to allow malicious bodies to incite\nmore significant harm. A community devoid of people is no community.\n\nMuch of the frustration has risen from inaction by authoritative figures.\nWhether inconsiderate sponsorship, conflicts of interest, harmful conduct, or\na refusal to collaborate, these actions have repeatedly affirmed such\npositions of authority as the effective owners of Nix with no consequence.\nAttempts at resolving any of these issues are to be deemed personal attacks\nwith little to no validity. No action is capable of overruling this imbalance\nof power. With little to no recourse, the community is expected to accept\nevery outcome.\n\n## Resolution\n\nOne must now decide, what kind of project is Nix? One that does good in the\nworld seems like a hard statement to argue with. Mindful creation is no new\nfeat, but clearly one that must be reiterated and practiced regularly in a\ncooperative manner. Still, there is no simple answer for Nix; rather, three\noutcomes appear possible.\n\n  1. The internet moves on, people forget. Despite the current attrition Nix will continue, if only slowed briefly. The only lesson learned will be to explicitly refuse any acknowledgement of non-technical Nix topics. Nix will continue on its journey to becoming a product.\n\n  2. The NixOS Foundation acknowledges its shortcomings and, in doing so, extend governance to contributors in a democratic fashion. Some will still leave, some will refuse to return, but cooperation will be the future of Nix. The events spoken of today will provide useful reference for management of contentious issues. Nix will be created by and for the Nix Community.\n\n  3. The NixOS Foundation refuses to admit its failures and instead asserts certain undesirable actions as acceptable. In doing so, those who disagree will have no choice but to remove themselves from the now permanently hostile environment. Nix will retain only contributors accepting of these actions. All other contributors will either leave Nix entirely or collaborate on a fork. Nix will have competition by way of those who care.\n\n## Inevitably\n\nNo member of the Nix Community enjoys its current state of affairs. The desire\nfor a more peaceful, collaborative environment is shared. Yet, some do not see\nthe incongruity of their views and actions with those opposing them. This\npiece is not likely to sway any of these parties, but still the reader is\nencouraged to reflect on these events and their forthcoming effects. The\nactions taken today will disturb the sobriety of tomorrow unless due care is\ntaken. Perhaps we can all do better for each other.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
