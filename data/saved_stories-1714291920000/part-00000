The\nBoring Phone is part of a new dumbphone boom, built on the suspicion of gen Z\ntowards the data- and attention-harvesting technologies they have grown up\nwith. That suspicion has fuelled reinventions of retro cultural artefacts \u2013 a\ntrend known as Newtro \u2013 and seen in the revival of vinyl records, cassettes,\nfanzines, 8-bit video games and old-fashioned mobile phones.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always hated being available to everyone,\u201d said Rana Ali. The 29-year-\nold former finance worker, who is now a music producer and rapper recording as\nSurya Sen, added: \u201cThe idea that if you send a WhatsApp to someone and they\ndon\u2019t respond immediately then something\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve had periods of having a\nsmartphone but I always revert back to having a burner phone.\u201d\n\nNostalgia for the Nokia 3310, the \u201cbrick\u201d phone with seemingly everlasting\nbattery life, prompted its relaunch in 2017, but the boom really began in the\nUS last year and was, ironically, fuelled by TikTokers posting under the\n#bringbackflipphones hashtag. HMD, which was behind the Nokia relaunch, saw\nits flip phone sales double by April 2023, while Punkt, which prefers to call\nthem feature phones or minimalist phones, has also seen substantial sales\nincreases.\n\nThe Boring Phone is a retro flip phone that proudly boasts of having minimal\nfeatures.\n\nBut Apple and Samsung are not under threat yet, according to Mintel. Nine out\nof 10 phones are smartphones and dumbphones remain niche, said Joe Birch, a\ntechnology analyst at the research firm. \u201cHowever, there is evidence of this\ngeneration modifying their smartphone behaviour, with concerns around the\nnegative impacts of being constantly digitally connected driving this,\u201d Birch\nadded. \u201cThree in five gen-Zers say they\u2019d like to be less connected to the\ndigital world, for instance.\u201d\n\nThis move to offlining, or digital minimalism, is also seen in gen Z\u2019s\ndeclining use of social media. They are the only generation whose time on\nsocial media has fallen since 2021, according to GWI, another research\ncompany, although older people are digitally detoxing too \u2013 including Lars\nSilberbauer, HMD\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cFor the first four hours, you\u2019re\ngetting a bit of anxiety,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then suddenly you start focusing and\nyou get back to behaviours you used to have.\u201d\n\nTwentysomethings are also more concerned about privacy, according to the\ntechnology analyst Portulans Institute, in an internet that can seem more like\na surveillance tool for brands, governments and scammers than a place to\npursue interests and find interesting people.\n\nOlder technologies can create more freedom: sampling in hip-hop and dance\nmusic has become almost impossible for emerging artists, since Spotify or\nYouTube\u2019s algorithms will spot uncleared samples and prevent tracks from\nuploading. But an underground artist can press 500 vinyl EPs and sell them to\nDJs and fans without difficulty.\n\nThe problem with offlining is that the world is increasingly difficult for\npeople without a smartphone. There are 2.4m households in the UK that cannot\nafford a mobile phone contract and 2 million young people who have no access\nto a learning device, said Hannah Whelan, coordinator of the Data Poverty Lab\nat the Good Things Foundation charity. \u201cMost essential services are now online\n\u2013 education, healthcare, universal credit,\u201d she said. People who cannot scan a\nQR code to fill in a form or order food are at least at a disadvantage, and\nsome systems require them.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best\nObserver writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Yes, I get\nlost a lot\n\nRead more\n\nThe Luddite Club, a group of New York schoolchildren who announced in December\n2022 they were giving up their iPhones in favour of flip phones, would still\nneed their smartphones, said Petter Neby, the founder of Punkt. \u201cIt\u2019s\nimpossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIn UK schools you\u2019re talking about banning the\nsmartphone but you have a school system that relies on online activity, for\nscheduling, for homework. I would love to ban smartphones for my children, but\nit\u2019s a much deeper question. We need to have a balance.\u201d\n\nPiers Garrett, a 27-year-old tech sales executive, tried to achieve that\nbalance by getting a Light Phone \u2013 a device that uses the same electronic ink\nused for e-readers and has no apps \u2013 but eventually gave up.\n\n\u201cThe idea was amazing, but I only lasted six months,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone\ncommunicates via WhatsApp. So now I have a happy medium. I\u2019m very strict with\nmy apps \u2013 just banking apps and train apps, and I turn off all my\nnotifications. Now when I wake up in the morning, I do things for myself \u2013\nhave a coffee, read a book. And I noticed the change \u2013 so much more clarity in\nmy mind.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Young people\n  * The Observer\n  * Smartphones\n  * Mobile phones (Technology)\n  * Telecoms\n  * Mobile phones (Money)\n  * Social media\n  * Digital media\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
