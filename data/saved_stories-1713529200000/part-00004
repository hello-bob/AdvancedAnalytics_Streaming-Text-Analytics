Very simple and usable multi-user VoIP solution.\nSome kind of alternative to Mumble.\n\nBut why? SIP-based solutions are pretty complicated to setup, because they are\nnot made for simple tasks like sudden voice chats between a few people.\nWebRTC-based solutions are insane bloated incredible monsters by complexity\nand size, hardly possible to debug and having frequent compatibility problems.\nThey work mainly only if you use the same kind of software and codecs, for\nexample Chromium, that requires dozens of gigabytes of disk space and much\nRAM, CPU time to build it. Taking an enormous amount of CPU power to slowly\nwork with it. Is not it pure insanity for such relatively simple task?\n\nMumble has wonderful simplicity and workability, but even its server side is\nstill written on Qt, which requires hundreds of megabytes of additional\nlibraries to build it up. And users tend to complain about its newer client\nversions quality and convenience.\n\nSo let\u2019s write as simple VoIP talking client as it is possible, without\ncompromising convenience and simplicity for the user! I just want a simple\ncommand, which only requires to specify the server\u2019s address with the key to\njust immediately talk with someone.\n\n  * No GUI requirement. Why would someone need a GUI for voice application? But a fancy real-time refreshing TUI would be desirable. Mumble tends to output no information, sometimes hiding the fact of a problem and that everything stopped working.\n  * Mono-cypher, mono-codec protocol.\n  * Maximal easiness of usage: here is your address, key, do me good.\n\nVoRS is copylefted free software licenced under GNU Affero GPLv3. It should\nwork on all POSIX-compatible systems.\n\nServer (above) and two clients (left and right) in a terminal multiplexer\n\n\u2022 Features:  \n---  \n\u2022 Install:  \n\u2022 Usage:  \n\u2022 VAD:  \n\u2022 Protocol:  \n  \nNext: Features\n\n", "frontpage": true}
