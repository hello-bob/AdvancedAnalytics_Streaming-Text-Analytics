Alone? Powerless in the face of forces beyond your control?\nTimothy Morton can help\u2014if you\u2019re ready to have your reality blown apart.\n\nIn 2008, the philosopher Timothy Morton was struck by a strange, existential\nfeeling, one that helped them formulate a word for phenomena that are too vast\nand fundamentally weird for humans to wrap their heads around.Art by Frank\nNitty 3000; Portrait by Arturo Olmos\n\nThe Future of Reality\n\n  * WIRED Peers Into the Future of Reality\n\n  * Q&A With Yahya Abdul-Mateen II\n\n  * The City and the City\n\n  * The Best Hacker Movie.

Timothy Morton disagrees: It has already ended, and\nnot a moment too soon. Not because doomsday has arrived, Morton clarifies, but\nbecause what we call \u201cthe world\u201d\u2014a place that revolves around human beings and\nis defined by what we can see and feel\u2014is simply too small to cope with\nreality anymore. Faced with massive forces whose impacts defy our physical\nperceptions, from global warming and extinction events to the Covid-19\npandemic, our parochial idea of the world falls away like the set of a movie\nbeing torn down.\n\nMorton, a kind-faced, 53-year-old professor and author with uncannily\npenetrating blue eyes, has spent the past nine years teaching in the English\ndepartment at Rice University in Houston, Texas. But they are known less for\ntheir contributions to Romantic scholarship\u2014which are many and insightful\u2014and\nmore as a kind of poet-philosopher for our age of ecological crisis. In 2008,\nMorton was struck by a strange, existential feeling, one that helped them\nformulate a word for phenomena that are too vast and fundamentally weird for\nhumans to wrap their heads around. If you\u2019ve spent any time on more\nmetaphysically inclined corners of the internet, you may have encountered the\nterm: hyperobjects. When Morton sat down to write a book on the subject in\n2012, Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology After the End of the World poured\nout of them in just 15 days.\n\nExamples of hyperobjects include: black holes, oil spills, all plastic ever\nmanufactured, capitalism, tectonic plates, and the solar system. Hyperobjects\nare often ancient or destined to be, like the sum total of Styrofoam and\nplutonium we have littered across the Earth over the past century, which will\nremain for millennia. A human being may see evidence of hyperobjects\u2014pollution\nhere, a hurricane there\u2014but try gazing off into the distance to see the\ntotality of them, or to the very end of them, and they disappear into a\nvanishing point. Hyperobjects, as Morton says, emerge only in fragments and\npatches that do not always seem to connect up from our view on the ground.\n\nThis article appears in the December 2021/January 2022 issue. Subscribe to\nWIRED.\n\nPhotograph: TSE\n\nIt\u2019s an enigmatic term, one whose meaning is by definition hard to grasp; it\noften seems more label than description. But it\u2019s precisely those squishy,\nelusive qualities that give it its explanatory power. The word hyperobject\noffers a useful shorthand for why threats like global warming are so difficult\nto understand or accept: They threaten our survival in ways that defy\ntraditional modes of thinking about reality and humiliate our cognitive\npowers, a disorienting shift that sends many people reeling into superstition,\npolarization, and denial. Hyperobjects speak to the immense, structural forces\nall around us, and even inside us, that we cannot see with our eyes but strive\nto comprehend through data or computer modeling. While they are not, in every\ncase, bad things, the most talked-about hyperobjects tend to be the most vivid\nand disturbing, particularly as they clip in and out of our vision like\nmalevolent ghosts.\n\nTrending Now\n\nUnderstanding these forces and responding to their urgent demands might be the\ngreatest challenge of our time, and contemplating hyperobjects, while an often\nfrustrating experience, can be an act of psychological reorientation. Once you\ngrasp them, even loosely, they offer a philosophical escape route from the\nlimitations of our poor little bodies, a way to make sense of a world that no\nlonger makes sense, an alternative to the conspiracy theories and fingers-in-\nears denials that have rushed to fill the void. Soon, you start seeing\nhyperobjects everywhere.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, reactions to Morton have been intense and polarized.\nHyperobjects has (and hyperobjects have) been called \u201cpessimistic,\u201d\n\u201cprovocative,\u201d \u201cdisempowering,\u201d \u201cgroundbreaking,\u201d \u201cdisturbing,\u201d and just plain\n\u201cweird.\u201d At the same time, Morton\u2019s ideas have found a passionate\u2014and\ngrowing\u2014readership outside traditional academia, drawing in everyone from\nartists and musicians to science fiction writers, architects, and students.\n\nIn the near-decade since its publication, Hyperobjects has been referenced in\na Buddhist blog post about ecological crisis, a New York Times op-ed on\ndigital privacy, and a BBC report about how concrete will soon outweigh all\nliving matter on the planet. Technology writers invoke the term as a way to\ntalk about the incomprehensibility of algorithms and the internet; science\nfiction author Jeff VanderMeer has said it neatly describes the bizarre alien\nphenomenon he wrote about in Annihilation, his surreal novel turned 2018\nmovie. The Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk has reached out to Morton to talk\nhyperobjects, and their email correspondence became part of a MoMA exhibit. In\n2019, Adam McKay, the former Saturday Night Live head writer and cocreator of\na heap of hit Hollywood comedies, was so inspired by Morton\u2019s work that he\nnamed his production company Hyperobject Industries. \u201cYou can feel your brain\nchanging ever so slightly because you never even considered that possibility,\u201d\nMcKay tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s Timothy. Every page of their writing has that\nfeeling.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Biggest Deepfake Porn Website Is Now Blocked in the UK\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nA Wave of AI Tools Is Set to Transform Work Meetings\n\nSteven Levy\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 32 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nThen Covid happened, alongside an accelerating number of devastating natural\ndisasters attributed to climate change, and Morton\u2019s ideas got about as\npopular as it\u2019s possible for enigmatic philosophical concepts to get. They\neven showed up in a Canadian parliamentary debate about the pandemic. \u201cWe see\nsomething bigger than us, something bigger than we could possibly imagine,\u201d\nsaid Charlie Angus, a member of Parliament. \u201cTimothy Morton calls it a\nhyperobject, something we cannot even completely comprehend. That is the power\nof this pandemic.\u201d Desperate to understand\u2014or accept that they couldn\u2019t\nunderstand\u2014these huge, interconnected forces, more and more people found\nresonance in what Morton had to say. \u201cHyperobjects were already here,\u201d as\nMorton wrote in their book, \u201cand slowly but surely we understood what they\nwere saying. They contacted us.\u201d\n\nThe message some readers heard in the arrival of these phenomena was a\nfrightening one: Look upon our works, ye mighty, and despair. But there\u2019s\nanother message in Morton\u2019s book, one that Morton is increasingly extolling as\nhopelessness threatens to paralyze so many: Our sense of \u201cthe world\u201d might be\nending, but humans are not doomed. In fact, the end of this limited notion of\nthe world may also be the only thing that can save us from ourselves.\n\n2.\n\n\u201cHow do you tell someone in a dream that they\u2019re a character in a dream?\u201d\nMorton asks the first time I meet them. We are in the same small Houston\nneighborhood where I spent a year in pandemic lockdown with my brother. It\u2019s\nAugust, and hot like Houston is always hot in the summer: so humid that\nwalking out the front door feels like stepping into a blistering, slightly\nthicker dimension. Morton has picked me up in their kicky Mazda3, and we\u2019re on\nour way to the Menil Collection, a museum and art collection housed in five\nbuildings, including a chapel, across 30 acres.\n\nMorton describes the origin of Hyperobjects as oracular\u2014like a radio\ntransmission sent from the future.\n\nArt by Frank Nitty 3000\n\nBorn in London and educated at Oxford, Morton\u2014who moved to Texas in 2012 for\nthe job at Rice\u2014is soft-spoken but intense. On the day we meet, they\u2019re\nwearing a shirt covered in green leaves that fade in and out of existence.\nThere\u2019s no way to persuade people in a dream to wake up, Morton tells me as we\nset out across sprawling highways, the stereo blasting a mix of \u201970s prog\nrock, deep house, and shoegaze. \u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate with them. You\u2019ve got to\nblow their minds.\u201d\n\nTalking with Morton, much like reading their writing, is a slightly\npsychedelic experience full of poetic leaps and circumlocutory spirals through\na dizzying array of topics: Star Wars, Buddhist meditation, Romantic poetry,\nDavid Lynch, quantum physics, The Muppet Show. One moment they\u2019re talking\nabout planet death and the finer points of Heidegger and Derrida, and the next\nthey\u2019re persuasively explaining to me why P.M. Dawn\u2019s 1991 R&B hit \u201cSet Adrift\non Memory Bliss\u201d is one of the greatest artistic achievements of all time, and\nwhy Han Solo\u2019s Millennium Falcon is a radically democratic ecological being\nthat \u201cannounces the possibility of a new age.\u201d None of it is non sequitur, but\nthe ideas can feel just out of reach, like a magic-eye picture that\u2019s on the\ncusp of snapping into view. Because Morton so often talks about things that\ncannot be talked about directly, the only way to locate them is to orbit\naround them, gesturing with metaphors that almost touch but not quite.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Biggest Deepfake Porn Website Is Now Blocked in the UK\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nA Wave of AI Tools Is Set to Transform Work Meetings\n\nSteven Levy\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 32 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nMorton describes the origin of Hyperobjects as oracular. When the idea for it\npopped into their head, Morton says, it felt like a radio transmission sent\nfrom the future. Not a fully formed idea, but a sense of waking up inside a\nstack of looming, massive systems that surrounded them and penetrated them. \u201cI\nwas like, what the fuck is that?\u201d Morton says, as we slow to a stop in the\nmidst of Houston\u2019s infamous traffic.\n\nThe word itself was inspired not by computer science\u2014\u201chyperobject\u201d is\nsometimes used to describe higher-dimension geometry in computer graphics\u2014but\nby a more pop-cultural source: \u201cHyperballad,\u201d an ethereal song by Bj\u00f6rk. In\nit, the musician sings about cathartically throwing random objects off a cliff\nand imagining herself as the forks and spoons and car parts hitting the\nground. To be hyper is to be or to come from beyond, much like the eccentric\nsongwriter and her music. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had your music and words in me for\ndecades,\u201d Morton wrote in one of their emails to Bj\u00f6rk. \u201cYou have so many\nnonhuman beings in your work.\u201d Morton sees her as something of a kindred\nspirit. As Morton puts it to me: \u201cI think she is from the future. I try to\nbe.\u201d\n\nMorton\u2019s frenzied two-week composition of Hyperobjects involved no notes and\ngushed out of them like sweat, full of tactile metaphors that tried to capture\nthe experiential strangeness of what it means to be inside one. \u201cI feel like\nNeo in The Matrix,\u201d Morton wrote in the first chapter, \u201clifting to his face in\nhorrified wonder his hand coated in the mirror-like substances into which the\ndoorknob has dissolved, as his virtual body begins to disintegrate.\u201d Morton,\nwho had spent much of their early career writing about Romantic literature and\nfood, had already been interested in ecological theory, but now they were\nmoving into even wilder territory: a controversial philosophical movement\ncalled object-oriented ontology.\n\nOpinion\n\nAI is An Ideology, Not A Technology\n\nJaron Lanier and E. Glen Weyl\n\nIt's a Gas\n\nIt\u2019s Time to Delete Carbon From the Atmosphere. But How?\n\nMatt Simon\n\nWIRED@25\n\n25 Years of WIRED Predictions: Why the Future Never Arrives\n\nDavid Karpf\n\nAccording to this school of thought, everything that exists is an\nobject\u2014forks, spoons, car parts, cats, America, global warming, human\nbeings\u2014and all objects are equally deserving of attention. The stance rejects\nhumans as the super-special only children of the universe, instead favoring a\nkind of equality between all things. As Morton looked deeper into object-\noriented ontology, they realized it was part of what they had been thinking\nand feeling all along. They quickly became one of the most prominent thinkers\nin the field. \u201cI\u2019d never been a part of a little group like that,\u201d Morton\nsays. \u201cI\u2019ve usually felt pretty different from people.\u201d Suddenly everything\nfell into place: \u201cClick click click.\u201d\n\nLots of Morton\u2019s readers felt that way too. \u201cI said the word, and then\neveryone said, \u2018Can you come to our school and say the word hyperobjects,\nplease?\u2019\u201d Morton recalls. It was the concept that everyone had been missing,\nthe one that pinned down the overwhelming feeling of something so big and\ncomplex that you can\u2019t see it, even and especially as it surrounds\u2014and often\nterrifies\u2014you.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Biggest Deepfake Porn Website Is Now Blocked in the UK\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nA Wave of AI Tools Is Set to Transform Work Meetings\n\nSteven Levy\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 32 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nWhen I picked up Hyperobjects for the first time, during lockdown, I was\nstruck by the holy dread that permeated almost every page. Hyperobjects were\n\u201cdemonic,\u201d \u201cmonstrous,\u201d \u201cmenacing,\u201d \u201ctraumatic,\u201d \u201chumiliating,\u201d and\n\u201chorrifying,\u201d akin to the skin-crawling, non-Euclidean monsters of H. P.\nLovecraft, creatures so alien and disturbing that to look upon them could\nshatter the mind. It wasn\u2019t light reading, particularly during a deadly\npandemic while isolated in a strange city that, itself, seemed to be falling\napart. (This past February, a cold snap took out Houston\u2019s inadequate power\ngrid, killing hundreds.) Hyperobjects often felt like a ghost story: tales of\notherworldly yet deeply familiar horror that I would stay up late to read.\n\nI wasn\u2019t alone in this feeling. Some of Morton\u2019s loudest detractors accused\nHyperobjects, with its talk of looming, invisible aliens and impending\ndisaster, of being too bleak and pessimistic\u2014the end of the world was right\nthere in the subtitle, after all. As the academic Elizabeth Boulton put it in\n2016, trying to sum up the reactions with scholarly neutrality: Morton\u2019s work\nis \u201cintended to awaken people abruptly, but debate exists as to whether\nMorton\u2019s approach is too harsh and disempowering, or whether it is the spur\nrequired for humans to adjust cognitively and emotionally to a new climate\nreality.\u201d It was a fair question, and one even Morton began to ask themself.\nWhat, in the final analysis, was the impact of their work? Were they waking\npeople up or just scaring the shit out of those who were already suffering?\n\n3.\n\nMorton and I make our way across the impossibly perfect grass outside the\nMenil Collection and into the main gallery space, where we pause before a work\ncalled Turbulence (black), by the artist Mona Hatoum. Thousands of variously\nsized glass marbles, arranged on a dark, round mat, seem to undulate like\nboiling water, or maybe spacetime in a black hole. \u201cThis could be an example\nof hyperobject art,\u201d Morton tells me. \u201cIt looks like everything is moving.\u201d\nMorton loves movement, depth, and the beauty that comes out of it. \u201cThe beauty\nof hyperobjects always has this spooky uncanniness ... It\u2019s spooky edging on\nfear.\u201d\n\nWhen I mention the visceral chill of dread I felt while reading Hyperobjects,\nMorton looks me deeply in the eyes, their face serious and empathetic. \u201cHow\nmuch money can I give you to apologize for this fear?\u201d They are kidding about\nthe money, probably, but not about their sense of responsibility to me and to\ntheir many other readers\u2014and particularly to the younger generation, including\ntheir 12-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter. \u201cHistory is weighing on them\nso much more than anybody else, and they need to know that they\u2019re not going\nto die inside,\u201d Morton says, their voice cracking with emotion.\n\nGrowing up was a struggle for Morton, perpetually unsure about where they\nbelonged. Gender was especially confusing. They didn\u2019t identify with maleness,\nparticularly the locker room vibe of their British private school, but weren\u2019t\nromantically interested in boys either, so \u201cgay\u201d didn\u2019t seem to fit. Over the\nyears, they\u2019ve accidentally bought women\u2019s clothes or shoes, and only realized\nit later by the odd looks they got from other people. When the word nonbinary\nmade its way into mainstream consciousness, it hit Morton like a thunderclap.\n\u201cI saw it in The New York Times and thought, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s me,\u2019\u201d Morton\nsays. Everything made sense, and the procrustean constraints of gender fell\naway. Like Neo, Morton says, they got to wake up. They cried with relief.\nClick click click.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Biggest Deepfake Porn Website Is Now Blocked in the UK\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nA Wave of AI Tools Is Set to Transform Work Meetings\n\nSteven Levy\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 32 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nAlthough most of their friends, family, and students were supportive when\nMorton came out, strangers were not always so kind. After wearing sparkly\nsilver nail polish to the supermarket one day, Morton acquired a stalker. They\nwoke the next morning to find a newspaper on their porch, open to a story\nabout a 19th-century woman who dressed as a man. Someone had also crept inside\nMorton\u2019s carport and left a bag of feces for them to find. It happened several\nmore times.\n\n\u201cIn any other previous society, I would have been executed, I think,\u201d Morton\nsays, \u201cfor my gender and for the thoughts in my head.\u201d The sense of\nincongruence, of not fitting into the categories and dogma that seemed to\ndefine the world, was often punishing\u2014but also, perhaps, led them more\nintuitively to boundary-pushing philosophical spaces that others might never\nhave imagined, or might have feared to tread in. The humbling, bizarre,\ndestabilizing nature of hyperobjects was always going to be something that\nmany people wanted to reject on its face. Indeed, many have.\n\nWhen Morton began talking about hyperobjects a decade ago, their goal was to\noffer people a dose of disquietude in hopes of inoculating them against the\ngrowing weirdness and terror of being alive, while startling them awake to the\nunprecedented geotrauma taking place around them. \u201cI wanted people to feel\nsome anxiety,\u201d Morton admits. \u201cSome people on this planet need to transition\nto a horror space\u201d in order to get to a new way of thinking, of seeing, of\ntaking action.\n\nBut by 2020, the horror space had arrived all on its own in the form of fire,\nflood, and deadly plague. As Morton tried to cope\u2014and watched students and\nother young people do the same\u2014the idea of jolting people awake felt\nunnecessary, even cruel. While working on a BBC radio series in 2020 titled\nThe End of the World Has Already Happened, Morton says they met a member of\nthe youth wing of the environmental movement Extinction Rebellion who told\nthem, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that to us. There has to be a world. You can\u2019t say that\nto Generation Z.\u201d\n\nMorton wouldn\u2019t write Hyperobjects again today, they say, or not the same way.\nThey don\u2019t want to scare people anymore\u2014things are already scary enough.\nMorton starts to choke up again as they talk about how badly they want\nsomething better for the next generation. Morton, too, has suffered from\ndepression, even struggled with suicidal thoughts; they know how dangerous\ndespair can be. \u201cHow dare I patronize people who are suffering?\u201d Morton says.\n\u201cHow dare I make them feel powerless and evil one more second? I know what\nthat feels like in my own life.\u201d\n\n4.\n\nDespite Morton\u2019s concerns, I don\u2019t think of Hyperobjects as an entirely\npessimistic book. Even though certain parts of it leave me haunted and a\nlittle bit freaked out, there\u2019s something about discovering the language for a\nfeeling, being able to name it, that is empowering\u2014a way of finding a handhold\nin the dim light of confusion rather than scrambling around in the dark.\n\nBeyond the existential terror that hyperobjects can inspire, another common\ncriticism is that the term is so sweeping and inclusive that it could be\napplied too broadly, to any object of sufficient size and complexity.\nDepending on your perspective, almost anything can be a hyperobject, can be\ninside one, or both. That doesn\u2019t make the concept meaningless, though; it\nmeans that the deep reality of your everyday world is quietly full to bursting\nwith the uncanny, both familiar and alien in equal measure. If you start\nrecognizing hyperobjects everywhere you go, then Morton has, on some level,\nsucceeded\u2014in changing your perspective, in reorienting your ontology.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Biggest Deepfake Porn Website Is Now Blocked in the UK\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nA Wave of AI Tools Is Set to Transform Work Meetings\n\nSteven Levy\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 32 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nGlobal warming might be a hyperobject, then, but so are the Florida\nEverglades, Earth\u2019s biosphere, and perhaps the infrastructure of the internet.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not necessarily evil, hyperobjects,\u201d as Morton points out. \u201cSome of\nthem are causing a lot of damage, but they\u2019re titans; they\u2019re not gods.\nThey\u2019re really big, but they\u2019re finite, so they can be defeated.\u201d On a\ncollective scale, human beings can even create new ones that have the power to\npush back. The #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, and climate movements are\nhyperobjects, too, that Morton says \u201cshowed up right on time\u201d as human-led,\nplanet-scale mobilizations ready to transform society. Although hyperobjects\nmay insist that we understand, or at least live within, a world where humans\nare no longer as powerful as we once imagined, no longer the protagonists in\nthe story of creation, they also offer something in return: intimacy.\n\n\u201cThe feeling of connecting to people, of being connected and enjoying it\u2014from\nthere, you could launch a bigger, less violent revolutionary politics,\u201d Morton\nsays as they drive me home at the end of our eight-hour day together. Anxiety\nabout things like climate disaster, Covid, or structural oppression may be\ninevitable, but rather than wallowing in fear, guilt, despair, or soul-\ncrushing statistics, Morton hopes we\u2019ll consider new ways of coexisting, both\nwith other people and with all other beings on the planet. If we can find it\nin ourselves to give up our need to dominate, control, and exploit everything\naround us, Morton says, we might find a way to care for and take more pleasure\nin each other, in the world around us, and in life itself. \u201cTraumatized people\nlike me are actually really helpful for this moment because they understand\nwhat it means to live in survival mode,\u201d Morton says. \u201cWe can help people by\nmodeling how to step away.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s even levity to be found in this reorientation. As McKay\u2014whose latest\nfilm under his Hyperobject Industries production banner, the apocalyptic\ncomedy Don\u2019t Look Up, comes out in December\u2014tells me, \u201cSometimes I\u2019m just\nlaughing when I\u2019m reading Timothy\u2019s work\u2014they\u2019re really funny. Laughter is one\nof the best tools to get near this mouth-agape, unabashed confusion.\u201d Or, as\nBj\u00f6rk puts it when she explains Morton to her friends: Morton is \u201cswerving the\napocalyptic angle into hope\u201d and \u201chas a lot of humor too, which is\nincredible.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Morton has expanded their ideas into new areas of thought,\npublishing books like All Art Is Ecological, a survey of their ideas that\nexamines how art can help us cope with and reimagine the world; Spacecraft,\nwhich explores the Millennium Falcon as a metaphor for the things that can\nhelp us make the jump to a more progressive space; and Hyposubjects (cowritten\nwith the anthropologist Dominic Boyer), which considers what a new kind of\nexistence could look like in the times to come. In true Morton fashion,\nhyposubject is another enigmatic, Greek-plus-Latin term, and one that\u2019s still\nin development. But as far as I can tell, it refers to the opposite of the\nsorts of humans who have ushered in the age of hyperobjects. Rather than\ndomineering bullies who \u201cget very high on the supply of their own dominion\u201d or\ngreedy vampires who suck the world dry for personal gain, they\u2019re outsiders\nwho live in the cracks and often stealthily dismantle the systems that are\nkilling us. \u201cThey play, they care, they adapt, they hurt, they laugh,\u201d Morton\nand Boyer write. Above all, hyposubjects reject the myopic, comforting myth\nthat any one person is over here while everyone and everything else is over\nthere.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Biggest Deepfake Porn Website Is Now Blocked in the UK\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Business\n\nA Wave of AI Tools Is Set to Transform Work Meetings\n\nSteven Levy\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 32 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nAlthough Morton has grown to love Texas, they marvel at how often Texans seem\nto think their connection to the world begins \u201conly when you leave the front\ndoor,\u201d Morton says. If the radical, \u201crugged\u201d individualism of the state, and\nAmerica at large, insists on anything, it is that our fates and our suffering\nare defined only by our personal choices, not by invisible, systemic forces\npressing down upon us or the people and things around us. This can make us\nfeel powerful and in control; it is also what alienates us from each other and\nleaves us ill-prepared to cope with hyperobjects. Perhaps that\u2019s why some\npeople react so angrily to Morton\u2019s work, to the idea that we are bound\ninextricably to each other. It makes us vulnerable.\n\nBut embracing this kind of intimacy may not be as difficult as we think, or\nonly as difficult as we think; realizing that we are all in this hyperobject\ntogether\u2014potentially, ultimately, as modest hyposubjects\u2014does not require a\ndeep spiritual conversion or an arduous journey. We do not need to walk on our\nknees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting, as the poet Mary\nOliver once wrote, to exist in solidarity with other beings. We already do,\nand we already are. We just need to accept it. As Morton says, \u201cWe\u2019re being\nborn now\u201d\u2014standing on the precipice not of becoming post-human, but of\nbecoming truly human for the first time.\n\nGrooming by Stefani Pitts\n\nSource Images: Getty Images\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.\nThis helps support our journalism.
