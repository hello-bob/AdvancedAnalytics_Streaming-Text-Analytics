This would be a departure from past Snapdragon\nchips for PCs, which have performed worse than (or, at best, similarly to)\nexisting Intel options, barely improved battery life, and come with a bunch of\nsoftware incompatibility problems to boot.\n\nEarly benchmarks that have trickled out look promising for the Snapdragon X.\nAnd there are other reasons to be optimistic\u2014the Snapdragon X Elite\u2019s design\nteam is headed up by some of the same people who made Apple Silicon so\nsuccessful in the first place.\n\nRumors indicate that Microsoft's flagship Surface tablet this year will switch\nto using Qualcomm's Arm chips exclusively rather than selling Arm and Intel\nversions alongside each other (an Intel Surface Pro 10 exists, but it's only\nsold to businesses). Microsoft has tried to make Arm Windows happen a bunch of\ntimes. But this time feels different.\n\n## A brief history of Arm Windows\n\nThe first public version of Windows to run on Arm processors was Windows RT,\nan Arm-compatible offshoot of Windows 8 that launched on a bare handful of\ndevices back in late 2012.\n\nWindows RT came with significant limitations, most notably a total inability\nto run traditional x86 Windows desktop apps\u2014all apps had to come from the\nMicrosoft Store, which was considerably more barren than it is today. There\nwas no x86 compatibility mode at all.\n\nThat limitation may have been due in part to the limited, low-performance Arm\nhardware available at the time. Arm processors were still predominantly\n32-bits, with slow processors and GPUs, 32 or 64GB of slow flash storage, and\njust 2GB of memory (at the time, 4GB was generally considered adequate for a\nPC, and 8GB was roomy). Even if you did have x86 app translation, translated\napps would have felt awful since the Arm hardware already struggled to run the\nnative built-in apps consistently well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / The Asus VivoTab RT, one of a bare handful of Windows RT tablets\nreleased during the Windows 8 era.\n\nAndrew Cunningham\n\n### Further Reading\n\nMy kingdom for some apps: The Asus VivoTab RT review\n\nWindows RT died the death it deserved to die; it never ran on many devices,\nand those that did had totally vanished from the market by 2015 or so. But the\ntechnical underpinnings of the operating system remain relevant today.\n\nAs detailed by then-Windows head Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft did significant\nwork to define a hardware abstraction layer (HAL), ACPI firmware, and basic\nclass drivers for the Arm version of Windows so that the OS could install and\nrun as expected on a wide variety of barely standardized Arm hardware the same\nway it did on a thoroughly standardized x86 PC. (Compare this to Google's Wild\nWest approach to Android, which to this day can\u2019t install basic OS or security\nupdates without specific intervention from chipmakers and device\nmanufacturers).\n\nThese were building blocks Microsoft could re-use for Windows 10, which first\ncame to Arm devices in 2017 with support for 32-bit x86 app translation. This\nversion of Windows-on-Arm also functioned more as a technical demo than the\ndawn of a new era, but it did come closer to becoming what Windows-on-Arm\nneeded to be to succeed: a drop-in replacement for the x86 version of Windows,\nwhere the two versions were largely indistinguishable for non-technical users.\n\nThe next big step down that path came in 2020 when Microsoft announced a\npreview of 64-bit Intel app translation for Arm PCs, though the final version\nended up being exclusive to Windows 11 when it launched in late 2021 (leaving\nbehind, incidentally, that first wave of Windows 10 Arm PCs with a Snapdragon\n835 processor in them\u2014another case where early-adopting into this ecosystem\nhas hosed users. Developers also got an easier on-ramp to Arm when Microsoft\nbegan allowing them to mix x86 and Arm code in the same app.\n\nThat brings us to where we are now: an Arm version of Windows that still has\nsome compatibility gaps, especially around external accessories and\nspecialized software. But the vast majority of productivity apps and even\ngames will now run happily on the Arm version of Windows, with no user or\ndeveloper intervention required.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n244\n\nAndrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with\na focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of\noperating systems like Windows and macOS.
