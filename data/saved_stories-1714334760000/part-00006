Except that is exactly\nwhat Trump\u2019s attorney D. John Sauer argued before the Supreme Court yesterday,\ntaking the position that former presidents have \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for so-\ncalled official acts they take in office.\n\n\u201cHow about if a president orders the military to stage a coup?\u201d Justice Elena\nKagan asked Sauer. \u201cI think it would depend on the circumstances whether it\nwas an official act,\u201d Sauer said after a brief exchange. \u201cIf it were an\nofficial act ... he would have to be impeached and convicted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sure sounds bad, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Kagan replied later.\n\nThe Democratic appointees on the bench sought to illustrate the inherent\nabsurdity of this argument with other scenarios as well\u2014Kagan got Sauer to\nadmit that the president could share nuclear secrets, while Justice Sonia\nSotomayor presented a scenario in which a president orders the military to\nassassinate a political rival. Sauer said that might qualify as an official\nact too. It was the only way to maintain the logic of his argument, which is\nthat Trump is above the law.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The cases against Trump: A guide\n\n\u201cTrying to overthrow the Constitution and subvert the peaceful transfer of\npower is not an official act, even if you conspire with other government\nemployees to do it and you make phone calls from the Oval Office,\u201d Michael\nWaldman, a legal expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal public-\npolicy organization, told me.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal argument is a path to dictatorship. That is not an exaggeration:\nHis legal theory is that presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for\nofficial acts. Under this theory, a sitting president could violate the law\nwith impunity, whether that is serving unlimited terms or assassinating any\npotential political opponents, unless the Senate impeaches and convicts the\npresident. Yet a legislature would be strongly disinclined to impeach, much\nless convict, a president who could murder all of them with total immunity\nbecause he did so as an official act. The same scenario applies to the Supreme\nCourt, which would probably not rule against a chief executive who could\nassassinate them and get away with it.\n\nThe conservative justices have, over the years, seen harbingers of tyranny in\nunion organizing, environmental regulations, civil-rights laws, and universal-\nhealth-care plans. When confronted with a legal theory that establishes actual\ntyranny, they were simply intrigued. As long as Donald Trump is the standard-\nbearer for the Republicans, every institution they control will contort itself\nin his image in an effort to protect him.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, does not need to accept Trump\u2019s absurdly broad\nclaim of immunity for him to prevail in his broader legal battle. Such a\nruling might damage the image of the Court, which has already been battered by\na parade of hard-right ideological rulings. But if Trump can prevail in\nNovember, delay is as good as immunity. The former president\u2019s best chance at\ndefeating the federal criminal charges against him is to win the election and\nthen order the Justice Department to dump the cases. The Court could\nsuperficially rule against Trump\u2019s immunity claim, but stall things enough to\ngive him that more fundamental victory.\n\nIf they wanted, the justices could rule expeditiously as well as narrowly,\nfocusing on the central claim in the case and rejecting the argument that\nformer presidents have absolute immunity for acts committed as president,\nwithout getting into which acts might qualify as official or not. Sauer also\nacknowledged under questioning by Justice Amy Coney Barrett that some of the\nallegations against Trump do not involve official acts but private ones, and\nso theoretically the prosecution could move ahead with those charges and not\nothers. But that wouldn\u2019t necessarily delay the trial sufficiently for Trump\u2019s\npurposes.\n\n\u201cOn big cases, it\u2019s entirely appropriate for the Supreme Court to really limit\nwhat they are doing to the facts of the case in front of it, rather than\nneeding to take the time to write an epic poem on the limits of presidential\nimmunity,\u201d Waldman said. \u201cIf they write a grant opinion, saying no president\nis above the law, but it comes out too late in the year, they will have\neffectively immunized Trump from prosecution before the election while\npretending not to.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s own attorneys argued in 2021, during his second impeachment trial,\nthat the fact that he could be criminally prosecuted later was a reason not to\nimpeach him. As The New York Times reported, Trump\u2019s attorney Bruce Castor\ntold Congress that \u201cafter he is out of office,\u201d then \u201cyou go and arrest him.\u201d\nTrump was acquitted in the Senate for his attempted coup after only a few\nRepublicans voted for conviction; some of those who voted to acquit did so\nreasoning that Trump was subject to criminal prosecution as a private citizen.\nThe catch-22 here reveals that the actual position being taken is that the\npresident is a king, or that he is entitled to make himself one. At least if\nhis name is Donald Trump.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The Supreme Courts goes through the looking glass of\npresidential immunity\n\nDemocracy relies on the rule of law and the consent of the governed\u2014neither of\nwhich is possible in a system where the president can commit crimes or order\nthem committed if he feels like it. \u201cWe can\u2019t possibly have an executive\nbranch that is cloaked in immunity and still expect them to act in the best\ninterests of the people in a functioning democracy,\u201d Praveen Fernandes, the\nvice president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal legal\norganization, told me.\n\nThe only part of Trump\u2019s case that contains anything resembling a reasonable\nargument is the idea that without some kind of immunity for official acts,\npresidents could be prosecuted on a flimsy basis by political rivals. But this\nargument is stretched beyond credibility when it comes to what Trump did,\nwhich was to try repeatedly and in multiple ways to unlawfully seize power\nafter losing an election. Even if the prospect of presidents being prosecuted\nfor official acts could undermine the peaceful transfer of power, actually\ntrying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power is a much more direct\nthreat\u2014especially because it has already happened. But the Republican-\nappointed justices seemed much more concerned about the hypothetical than the\nreality.\n\n\u201cIf an incumbent who loses a very close, hotly contested election knows that a\nreal possibility after leaving office is not that the president is going to be\nable to go off into a peaceful retirement but that the president may be\ncriminally prosecuted by a bitter political opponent,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito\nasked, \u201cwill that not lead us into a cycle that destabilizes the functioning\nof our country as a democracy?\u201d\n\nTrump has the conservative justices arguing that you cannot prosecute a former\npresident for trying to overthrow the country, because then they might try to\noverthrow the country, something Trump already attempted and is demanding\nimmunity for doing. The incentive for an incumbent to execute a coup is simply\nmuch greater if the Supreme Court decides that the incumbent cannot be held\naccountable if he fails. And not just a coup, but any kind of brazen criminal\nbehavior. \u201cThe Framers did not put an immunity clause into the Constitution.\nThey knew how to,\u201d Kagan pointed out during oral arguments. \u201cAnd, you know,\nnot so surprising, they were reacting against a monarch who claimed to be\nabove the law. Wasn\u2019t the whole point that the president was not a monarch and\nthe president was not supposed to be above the law?\u201d\n\nAt least a few of the right-wing justices seemed inclined to if not accept\nTrump\u2019s immunity claim, then delay the trial, which would likely improve his\nreelection prospects. As with the Colorado ballot-access case earlier this\nyear, in which the justices prevented Trump from being thrown off the ballot\nin accordance with the Constitution\u2019s ban on insurrectionists holding office,\nthe justices\u2019 positions rest on a denial of the singularity of Trump\u2019s\nactions.\n\nNo previous president has sought to overthrow the Constitution by staying in\npower after losing an election. Trump is the only one, which is why these\nquestions are being raised now. Pretending that these matters concern the\npowers of the presidency more broadly is merely the path the justices\nsympathetic to Trump have chosen to take in order to rationalize protecting\nthe man they would prefer to be the next president. What the justices\u2014and\nother Republican loyalists\u2014are loath to acknowledge is that Trump is not being\nuniquely persecuted; he is uniquely criminal.\n\nThis case\u2014even more than the Colorado ballot-eligibility case\u2014unites the\nright-wing justices\u2019 political and ideological interests with Trump\u2019s own. One\nway or another, they will have to choose between Trumpism and democracy.\nThey\u2019ve given the public little reason to believe that they will choose any\ndifferently than the majority of their colleagues in the Republican Party.\n\nAdam Serwer is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
