This was a tough choice for me; after all, why should someone pay\nfor something they can get for free?\n\n## What\u2019s in it for you\n\nThe core value proposition of SoundSeer is that it lets you see what\u2019s playing\non Spotify without distracting you from your work. As I mentioned, this app is\nopen-source, so you can get it for free. But think about the value of your\ntime.\n\nYou have to:\n\n  * Download the code\n  * Open a Spotify Developer account and get an API key\n  * Build from source\n  * Manually update when changes are made, because updates are managed by the App Store\n\nSuppose you\u2019re really good, and you can do this in 5 minutes. If you make at\nleast $25 an hour, and you value your time as such, you\u2019re basically losing\nmoney.\n\nIn addition, you get the pride of knowing that you support open-source\nsoftware and indie developers. (And I\u2019m not blowing smoke. I truly believe\nthis is important.)\n\n## What\u2019s in it for me\n\nSince I\u2019m charging money for the app, clearly one of the benefits is that I\nreceive money. But that\u2019s not my primary motivation for doing so. I want to\nvalidate my idea. Does SoundSeer truly add value to someone\u2019s life? Once I\nstart charging for it, the truth will become abundantly clear. This does scare\nme a bit, but I recognize that the pursuit of truth will make me a better\ndeveloper.\n\n## The ask\n\nI\u2019d like you to give SoundSeer a try. If you\u2019re not happy, I will approve any\nrefund request that comes my way.\n\nHowever, I hope this also inspires a larger conversation about supporting\nthings that matter. If you think open source and indie developers are\nimportant, I strongly encourage you to vote with your wallet.\n\n## Comments\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nJonathan Garelick\n\n## About\n\n## Privacy\n\n## Social\n\nDesigned with WordPress\n\n", "frontpage": false}
