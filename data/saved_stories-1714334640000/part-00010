It was not\nunfamiliar but, after a while, it started to go all over the place.\n\nScience presenter Liz Bonnin\u2019s accent, as regular BBC viewers know, is Irish.\nBut this voice message, ostensibly granting permission to use her likeness in\nan ad campaign, seemed to place her on the other side of the world.\n\nThe message, it turns out, was a fake \u2013 AI-generated to mimic Bonnin\u2019s voice.\nHer management team got hold of it after they saw the presenter\u2019s face on\nonline ads for an insect repellant spray this week, something for which she\ndid not sign up.\n\n\u201cAt the very beginning it does sound like me but then I sound a bit Australian\nand then it\u2019s definitely an English woman by the end. It\u2019s all fragmented and\nthere\u2019s no cadence to it,\u201d said Bonnin, best known for presenting Bang Goes\nThe Theory and Our Changing Planet.\n\n\u201cIt does feel like a violation and it\u2019s not a pleasant thing,\u201d she added.\n\u201cThank goodness it was just an insect repellant spray and that I wasn\u2019t\nsupposedly advertising something really horrid!\u201d\n\nHoward Carter, the chief executive of Incognito, the company behind the\nbotched campaign, claims he was sent a number of voice messages by someone he\nthought was Bonnin. He said these voice messages \u201cclinched it\u201d for him that he\nwas really speaking to her.\n\nHe had previously sought her endorsement before being approached by a Facebook\nprofile adopting Bonnin\u2019s identity. He claims the messages exchanged between\nthe two led him to believe she was the real deal despite thinking the profile\nwas \u201ca bit suspect\u201d.\n\nThe person assuming Bonnin\u2019s identity gave Carter a phone number and email\naddress. They also provided him with contact details from someone pretending\nto be from the Wildlife Trusts, the charity where Bonnin serves as president.\nHe said the deal was negotiated via WhatsApp and emails. He also claims he\nspoke to one of the scammers impersonating Bonnin over the phone on at least\none occasion.\n\nOn 13 March, Carter received a contract via email that he believed was\nelectronically signed by Bonnin. The company sent \u00a320,000 to an account linked\nto a digital bank on 15 March, bank statements show. Images of Bonnin for use\nin the campaign were sent five days later.\n\nFurther emails sent by Incognito went unanswered. The campaign launched on\nMonday, using quotes and images sent by the scammers. Hours later, Bonnin said\non X that she did not agree to any endorsement with the company.\n\nThe person impersonating Bonnin texted Carter on Tuesday to apologise and said\nshe was not handling her social media and also cited server and security\nissues. At this point, the penny dropped for Carter that he had been duped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry for what the company has gone through. It\u2019s not fun for them\nat all, but it\u2019s a violation on both our parts. It is a reminder that, if it\nlooks too good to be true and too easy, or a little bit strange, triple check\nor quadruple check,\u201d said Bonnin.\n\nShe added: \u201cIf somebody contacts you and says, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s not go through the\nprofessional route\u2019, then beware!\u201d\n\nCarter claims he did not get the deal signed off through Bonnin\u2019s management\nagency because the person impersonating her said \u201cshe was doing us a favour,\nprovided we do it direct with her & not involve her main agency\u201d.\n\nIn a voice note heard by the Guardian, the AI-generated Bonnin says a number\nof stilted phrases, such as \u201cI must thank you for providing clarity on the\ndirection you envision for our collaboration.\u201d\n\nTwo AI experts who assessed the voice note agreed it was likely to have been\nartificially generated. Surya Koppisetti, a senior applied scientist at image\ndetection startup Reality Defender said: \u201cThere are gaps and recitation speed\nissues that are consistent with AI-generated speech. The dialogue is\ninconsistent in accent.\u201d Koppisetti added that the speech quality was\n\u201cunusually clear despite the noise\u201d.\n\nMichael Keeling, a senior data scientist at the AI technology company Faculty,\nsaid the \u201csteady, monotone\u201d artificial background noise in the message \u201cis a\nclassic way of making something seem more realistic\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re listening to\nthis from your phone on a busy street, it\u2019s much easier to slip through that\nway,\u201d he added.\n\nBonnin said the incident is a \u201cwarning message\u201d about the potential pitfalls\nof AI. \u201cThere are many ways AI can be used to benefit society, we\u2019ve heard it\ncan be used to identify cancers, but it is also deeply unconcernedly not\nregulated enough. The technology is only going to get better and more\nsophisticated,\u201d she added.\n\nIncognito said they have reported the incident to the police and with their\nbank. In a statement, they said: \u201cWe hope [our CEO] falling for this elaborate\nscam will be a warning to others not to fall for the same or similar ruses.\nSophisticated criminals using AI and other computer-generated communications\nhave targeted Howard and Incognito a few times.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, many companies do not want the public to hear they\u2019ve been\ndeceived because of the embarrassment and shame. As an ethical, transparently\nrun company, we feel it is our duty to alert people and their businesses about\nthe rise of clever deceptions like this. Howard and everybody else in our\norganisation apologises to Liz Bonnin and her associates for any harm we have\ninadvertently caused.\u201d\n\nThe BBC did not respond to a request for comment. The Wildlife Trusts declined\nto comment.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Scams\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### UK competition watchdog steps up scrutiny of big tech\u2019s role in AI startups\n\n4d ago\n\n  * ### Can AI image generators be policed to prevent explicit deepfakes of children?\n\n6d ago\n\n  * ### Sex offender banned from using AI tools in landmark UK case\n\n21 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### UK has real concerns about AI risks, says competition regulator\n\n11 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Miss AI\u2019 is billed as a leap forward \u2013 but feels like a monumental step backwards\n\n5d ago\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### AI race heats up as OpenAI, Google and Mistral release new models\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Meta\u2019s Nick Clegg plays down AI\u2019s threat to global democracy\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Why I wrote an AI transparency statement for my book, and think other authors should too\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
