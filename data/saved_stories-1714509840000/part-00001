(Image credit: Italian National Research Council)\n\nThe decipherment of an ancient scroll has revealed where the Greek philosopher\nPlato is buried, Italian researchers suggest.\n\nGraziano Ranocchia, a philosopher at the University of Pisa, and colleagues\nused artificial intelligence (AI) to decipher text preserved on charred pieces\nof papyrus recovered in Herculaneum, an ancient Roman town located near\nPompeii, according to a translated statement from Italy's National Research\nCouncil.\n\nLike Pompeii, Herculaneum was destroyed in A.D. 79 when Mount Vesuvius\nerupted, cloaking the region in ash and pyroclastic flows.\n\nOne of the scrolls carbonized by the eruption includes the writings of\nPhilodemus of Gadara (lived circa 110 to 30 B.C.), an Epicurean philosopher\nwho studied in Athens and later lived in Italy. This text, known as the\n\"History of the Academy,\" details the academy that Plato founded in the fourth\ncentury B.C. and gives details about Plato's life, including his burial place.\n\nHistorians already knew that Plato, the famous student of Socrates who wrote\ndown his teacher's philosophies as well as his own, was buried at the Academy,\nwhich the Roman general Sulla destroyed in 86 B.C. But researchers weren't\nsure exactly where on the school's grounds that Plato, who died in Athens in\n348 or 347 B.C., had been laid to rest.\n\nRelated: Skeleton of man fleeing Mount Vesuvius eruption found in Herculaneum\n\nHowever, with advances in technology, researchers were able to employ a\nvariety of cutting-edge techniques including infrared and ultraviolet optical\nimaging, thermal imaging and tomography to read the ancient papyrus, which is\nnow part of the collection at the National Library of Naples.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nSo far, researchers have identified 1,000 words, or roughly 30% of the text\nwritten by Philodemus.\n\n\"Among the most important news, we read that Plato was buried in the garden\nreserved for him (a private area intended for the Platonic school) of the\nAcademy in Athens, near the so-called Museion or sacellum sacred to the\nMuses,\" researchers wrote in the statement. \"Until now it was only known that\nhe was buried generically in the Academy.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014AI reveals scroll's lost text after it was scorched by Mount Vesuvius\neruption 2,000 years ago\n\n\u2014Newfound corpses at Pompeii were a master and servant who died together\n\n\u2014Archaeologists uncover tiny room belonging to family of slaves in Pompeii\n\nThe text also detailed how Plato was \"sold into slavery\" sometime between 404\nand 399 B.C. (It was previously thought that this occurred in 387 B.C.)\n\nAnother part of the translated text describes a dialogue between characters,\nin which Plato shows disdain for the musical and rhythmic abilities of a\nbarbarian musician from Thrace, according to the statement.\n\nThis isn't the first time that researchers have used AI to read ancient\nscrolls that survived Mount Vesuvius's eruption. Earlier this year,\nresearchers deciphered a different scroll that was charred during the volcanic\neruption at a nearby villa that once belonged to Julius Caesar's father-in-\nlaw.\n\nJennifer Nalewicki\n\nLive Science Staff Writer\n\nJennifer Nalewicki is a Salt Lake City-based journalist whose work has been\nfeatured in The New York Times, Smithsonian Magazine, Scientific American,\nPopular Mechanics and more.
