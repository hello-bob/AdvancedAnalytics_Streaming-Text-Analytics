This\nproblem is fundamental to the fields of machine learning, artificial\nintelligence, and data compression. In fact, it might even be essential to\nunderstanding how human intelligence works.\n\nIn the past there have been several RPS programming contests. A game released\nby the New York Times popularized the fact that a RPS AI can consistently beat\nhuman players. When playing several rounds of RPS against the same opponent,\nit is possible to try to predict what the opponent will do in order to gain an\nadvantage. However, it is impossible to gain an advantage against an opponent\nwho is playing completely randomly.\n\nIf playing randomly is the optimal strategy, what is the point of a RPS\ncompetition? It is actually possible to do much better than a random player\nwhen the contest involves non-random competitors. This is because a strong\nplayer can consistently beat predictable players, while a random player will\nwin about half of its matches. This means that random players will tend to\nrank around the middle of a competition leaderboard, while strong players will\nconsistently rank higher.\n\nThis website is intended to host an ongoing competition to rank RPS programs.\nAll submissions must be made using the Python programming language. The source\ncode for all submissions will be publicly viewable. You may make as many\nsubmissions as you like. May the best AI win!\n\n> Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.\n\n-Niels Bohr\n\n", "frontpage": false}
