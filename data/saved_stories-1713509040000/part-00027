The accounts of the historical Jesus and\nhis saving teaching, given us in three corroborating reports in Matthew, Mark\nand Luke, are often played down in favor of a set of verses from the letters\nof Paul. That \u201ctreadmill\u201d of favorite evangelical proof-texts also relies\nheavily on John\u2019s Gospel. This unbalanced use of Scripture results in a\ndistortion of Jesus\u2019 claim to be Messiah, Son of God, in relation to his\nFather whom he defined as \u201cthe only one who is truly God\u201d (John 17:3).\n\nThe crux of the problem lies in this fact: Jesus\u2019 own very Jewish creed, which\nhe affirmed as the most important truth of all in agreement with a Jewish\nscribe (Mark 12:28-34), has been allowed no voice in the traditional creeds\nrecited in Church. Worse still, when the unitary monotheistic creed of Jesus\nand Paul is advanced as the necessary bedrock of good Christian thinking, its\nexponents are likely to be charged with upsetting the longstanding findings of\nthe church councils. They are even made unwelcome in church settings.\n\nAnthony Buzzard invites scholars and laymen alike to take seriously Jesus\u2019\nJewish creed, his recitation of the Shema, \u201cHear, O Israel,\u201d which proclaims\nGod to be one single Lord. Defining God and His Son biblically remains part of\nthe unfinished work of the Reformation. The evidence placed before the reader\nshows that a major paradigm shift is needed if Christians are to worship their\nGod in spirit and in truth, uncluttered by the philosophical and confusing\nideas of God which form part of received church tradition. Buzzard\u2019s thesis\nhas enormous significance for the discussion among three great world religions\n\u2014 Christianity, Judaism and Islam.\n\nClick here to purchase.\n\n#### Recent Articles\n\n  * Rediscovering the God of Jesus\n  * In the Book of Revelation, God is not the Lamb, and the Lamb is not God\n  * Yahweh God\n  * Is Matthew 28:19 A Forgery?\n  * Jesus\u2019 Pre-Existence \u2013 Literal or Ideal?\n\nSearch \u2013 About \u2013 Donate\n\nCopyright 2023 \u00a9 Spirit & Truth.
