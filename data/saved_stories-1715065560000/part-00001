Since then, advertising revenue has been\nprioritized, according to critics\n\nTwo people walk past the Google logo during a fair in Hanover, Germany, on\nApril 22.Annegret Hilse (REUTERS)\n\nJordi P\u00e9rez Colom\u00e9\n\nMay 05, 2024 - 05:17 GMT+2\n\n\u201cI am getting concerned that growth is all we are thinking about.\u201d That\u2019s what\nBen Gomes, the former head of Search at Google, wrote in an internal email in\n2019. The concern was part of a debate that was opened when senior executives,\nworried about weak query numbers, decided to create a \u201cyellow code.\u201d This\nsparked the tech giant\u2019s biggest internal alarm.\n\nOne objective of that yellow code was to increase the number of searches on\nGoogle. The ultimate problem they wanted to solve was to find a way for users\nto see more ads to earn more advertising money. This email chain between\nGoogle executives has come to light thanks to the monopoly case that the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice has brought against the company. Bloomberg reported on\nthese emails last fall and, a few days ago, an article in journalist Ed\nZitron\u2019s newsletter \u2014 titled The Man Who Killed Google Search, which is based\non those emails and provides new details \u2014 has sparked a huge debate in\nSilicon Valley.\n\n> Today's newsletter is the story of how Prabhakar Raghavan, Google's former\n> head of ads - led a coup so that he could run Google Search, and how an\n> email chain from 2019 began a cascade of events that would lead to him\n> running it into the ground.https://t.co/BlUwkcW1ex\n>\n> \u2014 Ed Zitron (@edzitron) April 23, 2024\n\nZitron\u2019s story delves into the growing controversy about how Google\u2019s search\nresults have gotten worse. According to this narrative, the culprit is clear:\nshort-term profit. In the email chain, the company\u2019s Advertising department is\nclearly seen pressuring the Search department, which does not want to harm the\nuser experience.\n\nSince 2014, Google has maintained more than 90% market share in search\nengines. But the arrival of AI and the deterioration of its responses has put\nits leadership in question. In March, at a meeting of Google employees, senior\nvice president Prabhakar Raghavan \u2014 who is now in charge of the Search and\nAds, among others areas \u2014 warned that the company had to brace for change. \u201cWe\ncan agree that things are not like they were 15 to 20 years ago, things have\nchanged,\u201d Raghavan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like life is going to be hunky-dory\nforever.\u201d\n\nPrabhakar Raghavan is precisely the person Zitron accuses of \u201ckilling Google\nsearch\u201d for allegedly prioritizing economic benefit over good search results.\nBut it is difficult to pin down a process as complex as sorting the web for\nbillions of results to just one person. And, in response to the commotion\ncaused by the article about Raghavan\u2019s role, the company has issued a clear\nmessage: \u201cAs we have stated definitively: the organic results you see in\nSearch are not affected by our ads systems,\u201d it said.\n\n> Google's PR team sent me the following response to the claim on the man at\n> Google who killed Google Search - story updated at https://t.co/ykZjCxRZIz\n> pic.twitter.com/rxqouXtpV3\n>\n> \u2014 Barry Schwartz (@rustybrick) April 25, 2024\n\nBut the debate that took place over various emails, in which the people in\ncharge of Search tried to defend its integrity, hints that the company may\nhave at various times prioritized growth over user experience.\n\nThe whole debate is fascinating, but there are several quotes that stand out.\nShashi Thakur, who in 2019 was vice president of Engineering, Search and\nDiscover, warned that \u201cthere was a good reason our founders separated search\nfrom ads.\u201d Then, in a more limited message to his team, he wrote: \u201cI think\nfinance folks are running like chicken with heads cut off. I guess the free\nride is ending and this is the first time they have to figure out how our\nbusiness actually works.\u201d\n\nThe most cited line of these emails is from Ben Gomes, head of Search, who\nresponded directly to Thakur: \u201cI think we are getting too close to the money,\u201d\nhe wrote in an internal email. \u201cI think it is good for us to aspire to query\ngrowth and to aspire to more users. But I think we are getting too involved\nwith ads for the good of the product and company,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to reduce this debate to a single topic: more queries mean more ads\nand, therefore, more profits. Of course, from the user\u2019s point of view, it is\nworse if you need three queries to find what you could previously find in one.\nGoogle, as a product, could get worse; but given its near-monopoly as a search\nengine, the danger did not seem very great.\n\n### Better one search than three\n\nIn an email that Gomes left in a draft \u2014 he only showed it to his team \u2014 he\nwarned what could happen: \u201cWe could increase queries quite easily in the short\nterm in user negative ways (turn off spell correction, turn off ranking\nimprovements, place refinements all over the page). If we, as a company, want\nto go there, we should discuss that. It is possible that there are trade-offs\nhere between different kinds of user negativity caused by engagement hacking.\nBut I will say that I am deeply, deeply uncomfortable with this.\u201d Indeed,\nGomes felt so \u201cuncomfortable\u201d that a year later he left his position, which\nwas given to Raghavan, who continued his rise at Google until today.\n\nIn a debate about this article in the Hacker News forum \u2014 a kind of social\nnetwork for Silicon Valley engineers \u2014 the most popular response is from a\nformer Google engineer, who argues that complexity, not money, has affected\nsearch results: \u201cI know a lot of the veteran engineers were upset when Ben\nGomes got shunted off. Probably the bigger change, from what I\u2019ve heard, was\nlosing Amit Singhal who led Search until 2016. Amit fought against creeping\ncomplexity. There is a semi-famous internal document he wrote where he argued\nagainst the other search leads that Google should use less machine-learning,\nor at least contain it as much as possible, so that ranking stays debuggable\nand understandable by human search engineers.\u201d\n\nAccording to this post, since Singhal left, complexity has skyrocketed, with\neach team launching as many deep learning projects as possible, just like any\nother large company in the sector: \u201cThe problem though, is the older systems\nhad obvious problems, while the newer systems have hidden bugs and conceptual\nissues which often don\u2019t show up in the metrics, and which compound over time\nas more complexity is layered on.\u201d Finally, the engineer explains that they\nfound an old bug that reordered the top results for 15% of queries since 2015.\n\u201cI handed it off when I left, but have no idea whether anyone actually fixed\nit or not,\u201d the user says.\n\nIn addition to this complexity, there are the thousands of SEO specialists\nwho, on a daily basis, try to trick or confuse the Google algorithm so that\ntheir results are ranked higher, with the sole objective of achieving\nadvertising revenue or links to e-commerce platforms. These types of sites\nhave gone from being trustworthy companies \u2014 honestly trying to advise on\nwhich coffee maker or tent to buy \u2014 to pure spam. Everything is leading to a\nperfect storm in which one of the pillars of the 21st century \u2014 the Google\nsearch engine \u2014 is getting a glimpse at the end of its days.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Colin Murdoch, from Google DeepMind: \u2018Gemini will transform the way\nbillions of people live and work\u2019\n\nManuel G.
