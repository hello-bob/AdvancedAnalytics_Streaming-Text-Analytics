Projects not getting out of the woodwork. People\nlosing steam.\n\nThe managers were put back in place. And things came to a functioning state\nsoon. As a side note, Google built a heavy data-powered HR department of sorts\nto optimize the engineering management function.\n\nThe people at Google had to experiment to conclude the need for skilled\nengineering management. But there is a class of people, who understand subtle\ntruths like these without the need for experiments.\n\nExperiments are merely confirmations of their powerful intuitions. When they\ndo things, results materialize, and systems start functioning. No matter the\nuncertainty, they somehow end up making it work.\n\n## My Exhausting Wanderings in Engineering Management - Summarized for Your\nBenefit\n\nBefore I got started with Hexmos, for the past decade or so, I was concerned\nwith Human Organization. I was trying to ascertain for myself what my\nprinciples should be. MBA curriculums didn't satisfy me. Nor did various forms\nof startup culture wisdom available all across the web. I was not at any stage\nwhere I could justify my positions in Engineering Management to others. I\nwanted to convince others, but first I wanted to ascertain for myself what is\nreasonable to preach. I wanted to be in the right company when thinking about\nEngineering Management.\n\nIf you want to think about physics matters - it doesn't hurt to find who have\nbeen the true masters of the field. You find Newton, you find Einstein, you\nfind Maxwell. Once you know the masters, once you are devoted to their methods\nand ways of thinking and doing, you are more likely to develop yourselves\nconstructively.\n\nSo - I was worrying about Engineering Management. I read many things. First, I\ntried to explore from the academic side. There was Herb Simon. He had\nincredible descriptions of how organizations work, in a sort of abstract and\nideal form. It was a great read. It created wonderful pictures in my mind. But\n- does it work, on a day-to-day basis? Are his views usable and applicable to\nme as a practicing founder of an upcoming startup? That was my worry. Also - I\nwas specifically concerned about building deep and complex technical\ncapabilities. I didn't care particularly about for example, how a restaurant\nbusiness works.\n\nAnd then it struck me that, given how complex a field of human organization\nis, perhaps the views of practitioners with a strong intellectual and\nscholarly bent would be a profitable direction to explore. At some point, I\nwas already aware of Lee Kuan Yew and his transformation of Singapore. While\nthis was not exactly a transformation of any particular organization, he was\ndealing with a small city-state, and I felt, maybe I could find some good\nprinciples there. And it indeed was - I read the whole works of Lee Kuan Yew,\nhis speeches, writings, everything. And it gave me a benchmark on how to think\nabout development starting from a position of weakness. How to focus, how to\nget things done, and what way one should conduct oneself in uncertain\nsituations and times.\n\nAnd I do not remember exactly how, but I also happened upon many works from\nvarious military leaders. I think there were the nice works of John Boyd,\nwhich I once read. I found some nice principles, but nothing is very strong or\nusable. Then at some point, I discovered Rickover, at first I read him with\ncuriosity, but eventually, grasping the ingenuity and powers of the man, I\nturned into a full convert. In essence, I became a Rickoid -- a spiritual\ndisciple of Rickover.\n\nRickover as leader made something deemed impossible, possible. He got the\nfirst nuclear-powered submarine working for the US military, in a partly\nresistant and hostile environment. That too, within 5 years of conception. New\nmaterials were invented, and extremely difficult technical, bureaucratic, and\npolitical obstacles were overcome. Despite the massive uncertainties involved,\nRickover created a flawless safety record -- of no nuclear disaster unfolding\nunder his watch.\n\nWhile his tangible achievements are doubtless great, in my opinion, what is of\ngreater value is his principles and teachings on how complex technological\nendeavors must be handled. Given my wide reading, I have not come across a\nmore coherent and reliable set of perspectives, ideas, and principles on\nengineering initiatives.\n\n## The Root Question: \"What Is the Purpose of The Organization?\"\n\nRickover always started with the purpose of the organization, and the end\ngoal. And he worked backwards from it. He had no time for fuzzy schemes and\ntheories. Once the goal was set, he would take the most effective means to\nachieve the goal. He was going to be useful, and get the job done.\n\n> I feel like that man as I talk to you today. I have fought for reform in the\n> Navy for years. If I still shout it is because I am afraid the Navy will not\n> be able to meet the demands which will be placed upon it in the future.\n> There are two broad reasons for this condition. First, we misread history.\n> Second, we do not ask the root question -- What is the Navy's purpose?\n\n## Engineering Know-How and Capabilities Is of Central Importance\n\nYou can see Rickover working backwards here.\n\nHe recognizes that the Navy's fighting efficacy is primarily dependent upon\nengineering efficacy.\n\nRickover alludes to the failures of \"line officers\" in handling engineering\nconcerns.\n\n> This question demands a fresh look at our naval past. Instead of basking in\n> past glories, we should ask: How well were the ships designed and built; how\n> well were they used in battle? These are matters of engineering. In\n> discussing engineering in the Navy, I am not going to consider the present\n> state of ordnance in the Navy, That area has been run by line officers\n> throughout this century and its failures are well-known\n\n## Managers Detesting Engineers Is a Common but Dangerous Occurrence\n\nRickover traced the history of the Navy and saw clearly that the line officers\nalways held engineers in a lower position.\n\nThey didn't understand the work involved, and took a sort of aristocratic\nattitude, leading to many practical failures.\n\n> The line officer detested the greasy engineer and his smoking boilers that\n> blackened the sails. Not until 1842 did Congress authorize an engineer carps\n> for the Navy. The selection of the first engineer-in-chief was evidence of\n> the low prestige of naval engineering. Gilbert L. Thompson combined the\n> talents of law, scholarship, and diplomacy, but he knew no engineering. He\n> could not speak for the engineers in the Navy, nor could he judge\n> engineering problems.\n\n> The Navy forgot the hard-earned lessons and attempted to return to the days\n> of sail. Aboard the ship, the position of the engineer deteriorated. The\n> chief engineer and his men were at the beck and call of the line officer. He\n> was denied the living quarters to which he was entitled. He was forced to\n> give way to the most junior line officer. He was not even allowed to eat in\n> the same mess with the line officers, He found his firemen taken from his\n> control and set to work shifting sails.\n\n## Managers Imposing Over Engineers in Technical Matters Leads to Disasters\n\nRickover recounts many, many examples where clueless line managers impose\ntheir half-baked ideas on the engineers on purely technical matters -\nultimately leading to bad outcomes for the navy.\n\n> Under these conditions, mistakes were inevitable, But, by and large, the\n> worst errors were caused by the imposition of the opinions of line officers\n> on technical matters. The result can be seen in the Navy's first three\n> battleships, one of which was the famous Oregon. The Bureau of Ordnance,\n> headed by a line officer, proposed a turret and gun arrangement based on the\n> hoped-for success of technical developments. When these did not materialize,\n> the turrets had to be redesigned. As a result, when any of these ships swung\n> their guns to deliver a broadside, it heeled over to such an extent that the\n> armor belt on the side toward the enemy dipped below the waterline, giving\n> no protection to the ship.\n\n## Engineers Must Fully Be \"in Tune\" with The Systems They Build and Manage\n\nThe Engineer must have an intuitive sense of the systems they work on.\n\nAnd this intuitive sense can only be developed via experience.\n\nRickover talks of Milligan, whose wise decisions against his line manager's\nwishes saved many lives for the US Navy.\n\n> Milligan was one of those old-fashioned engineers who was never far from his\n> engines. He was one of that breed of men taught by experience. These\n> engineers\u2014and I proudly and with no false humility class myself with them\n> \u2014could walk through an engine room and, through the din and uproar, catch\n> the slight sound of a component out of adjustment, They could touch a jacket\n> of metal and feel from the vibrations whether the machinery inside was\n> operating well. They would taste boiler water to see if it were pure, and\n> would dip their fingers into the lubricating oil to find out if a bearing\n> was pinning hot.\n\n## In the Navy, Lack of Engineering Chops Meant Death\n\nRickover recounts a tragedy -- the death of 65 -- due to a line manager's lack\nof Engineering capability on board:\n\n> Some did, others did not. In 1905, a boiler explosion aboard the gunboat\n> Bennington, at anchor in San Diego harbor, cost 65 lives. Subsequent\n> investigation revealed that the chief engineer was an ensign who had never\n> stood an engine room watch before being assigned to the billet. He knew\n> nothing of machinery, and he did not have the technical knowledge to stop\n> the chain of events that led to the tragedy. He had never been required, nor\n> given the opportunity, to acquire the necessary knowledge. The Bennington\n> disaster was an extreme example of how far some line officers had yet to go\n> to recognize the need for proficiency in engineering on board ship. The old\n> way was simply not good enough.\n\n## The Design Engineers Must Be as Respected as Operational Engineers\n\nDue to accidents and bad experiences, the Navy first recognized the value of\nOperation Engineers.\n\nBut the design engineers were recognized only later.\n\nThe devaluation of the various types of engineers doesn't end well usually:\n\n> The Navy could also rely on American industry as another source of\n> technology. Although this was a period of rapid growth, there was a serious\n> weakness. The status of the engineer aboard ship was by now satisfactory,\n> but the importance of the design engineers\u2014those who could design ships and\n> machinery\u2014had been forgotten\n\n## Let the Engineers Focus on Important Engineering Activities\n\nRelatable even today, the Engineer must be kept close to the core engineering\nproblems relating to the organization.\n\nTaking away their focus on irrelevant things means subpar outcomes.\n\n> One reason was, that instead of devoting full time to the condition of our\n> ships, top Navy officials also spent time on unimportant matters. As an\n> example, between World Wars I and II, the Secretary of the Navy promulgated\n> a General Order\u2014the highest type of official directive that can be issued\u2014\n> concerning the Navy's homing pigeon establishment. This Order divided\n> responsibilities for the care and operation of pigeons among the Bureau of\n> Engineering, the Bureau of Construction and Repair, the Bureau of\n> Navigation, and the Director of Naval Communications. All these\n> organizations were involved in pigeons at one time or another, Their\n> responsibilities included, among other things, pigeon population and\n> banding, transportation, housing, and food. There were also plans and\n> literature concerning the pigeon service, miscellaneous equipment, and other\n> pigeon problems.\n\n## Value Rigorous Practical Experience Over Theoretical Credentials\n\nRickover emphasized practical experience running real systems, rather than\nmere theoretical credentials.\n\nYou can see him batting for people with 2 years of practical experience\nrunning his ships over people with paper credentials in a subject such as\nmanagement or computer science.\n\nAs he says, the machinery does not respect these irrelevant capabilities:\n\n> The emphasis on operational engineering experience is just the opposite in\n> nuclear ships. Since the beginning, I have required all nuclear ship\n> captains as well as their subordinate officers to qualify as operators of\n> the propulsion plant before being assigned to a ship. Before being assigned\n> as chief engineer, executive officer, or captain of a nuclear ship, the\n> nuclear-trained officer must complete a comprehensive eight-hour written\n> examination and a three-hour oral examination at my headquarters in\n> Washington. I personally approve or disapprove of all examination results.\n> To be eligible for the examination, he must be recommended by his commanding\n> officer and must first have completed one year of academic and operational\n> training, which includes qualification as a watch officer on a fully\n> operational land prototype nuclear propulsion plant, similar to the ones we\n> have at sea. An engineering Department officer, once he has completed his\n> initial training, must qualify as a watch officer on a nuclear ship and\n> serving in the engineering Department for at least one year,\n\n> These requirements produce line officers who are familiar with the operating\n> details of their propulsion plants and are not afraid to get their hands\n> dirty. When reports from subordinates conflict, or where they doubt the\n> accuracy, they know enough to look for themselves and to put the weight of\n> their own experience behind the decision. They also know how to train their\n> officers and men and inspect their plants. They possess that essential\n> requisite of leadership\u2014 to educate and to train. I would much rather have\n> officers with this sort of experience than those with postgraduate degrees\n> in systems analysis, computer science, management, or business\n> administration\u2014as many of the Navy's line officers now have, The machinery\n> does not respect these irrelevant capabilities.\n\n## Management Techniques Cannot Make up For Substandard Engineering Quality\n\nThe usual response from management types is to attempt reorganizations and\nmakeshift arrangements to deal with technical deficiencies within the\norganization.\n\n> To meet the demands of the technological revolution we had witnessed since\n> World War II, the Navy had two choices. It could make the strenuous effort\n> needed to keep abreast of technology. Or it could let technical competence\n> fall from its grasp; placing its dependence on industry, tinkering with its\n> organization, and, through various makeshift arrangements, attempt to keep\n> track of the technical developments upon which its future depended. The\n> decision was to rely on reorganization and management techniques. The result\n> was a flood of studies and an endless series of reorganizations, all of\n> which increased emphasis on \"management' and decreased the reliance on\n> technical competence.\n\n## Too Many Approvals via Layers of Management Leads to Engineering Paralysis\n\nSome management \"reorganizations\" end up adding layers and layers of\nmanagement, and the engineers have to keep asking for approvals to get\nanything done - which saps their initiatives, intelligence, and energy.\n\n> This reorganization created a new bureaucracy\u2014the Office of the Chief of\n> Naval Material-\u2014\u2014which has now grown to 800 people, thus adding another huge\n> layer of management between the technical people who have to deal with the\n> engineering details if they are to get the job done, and the people in\n> charge whose approval must be obtained to proceed. They are empowered to ask\n> any questions and to stop the work from proceeding. Their endorsement must\n> be obtained before forwarding a recommendation to higher authority in the\n> chain of command. But there is no one that I can find in the Naval Material\n> Command who has the authority to approve proceeding with programs.\n\n## Non-Technical Organization Cannot \"manage\" Technical Organizations\n\nRickover criticizes McNamara's view that they could \"manage\" technical\nprojects via management techniques with execution powers rested with industry.\n\n> The growing dependence upon management systems has been another\n> characteristic which has evolved in the years since World War II. Secretary\n> McNamara, instead of requiring the Navy to build up its in-house technical\n> capability decreed that it should depend on the industry. The Navy could\n> \"manage\" the projects that it assigned to the industry. His successors have\n> followed the same path. I have learned from many years of bitter experience\n> that we cannot depend on industry to develop, maintain, and have available a\n> technical organization capable of handling the design of complex ships and\n> their equipment without the Navy, itself, having a strong technical\n> organization to oversee the work in detail.\n\n## There Is Not a Single Management Gimmick That Can Save You from A Lack of\nTechnical Competence\n\nGimmicky management \"systems\" keep popping up, and it eats up the attention of\nnaive managers.\n\nThe Engineering profession, on the other hand, is closely connected to ground\nrealities, out of necessity gel with reality and deliver results.\n\n> Management systems are as endemic to the Government as the Black The plague\n> was in Medieval Europe. Brochure after brochure crosses my desk offering\n> seminars and courses in management. Usually, these are aimed at Government\n> officials. Details vary, but the substance is the same. For a substantial\n> fee, paid by the Government, and for a few days spent in pleasant\n> surroundings, those attending the seminars will be taught management,\n> Usually, the agenda contains numbers: seven trends of management, five\n> differences between a leader and a manager, four functions of a leader, five\n> ideas for improving human relations, and three basic situations. There are\n> gimmicks. I have a pocket-sized plastic card, complete with different\n> colored eggs long-sweeping arrows, and fine print. Problems go one way,\n> decisions another, and plans in yet a third direction. Presumably, a person,\n> faced with a decision, has only to pull out this card and follow the arrows.\n> That is if he has the time and the patience, and can comprehend it, I can't.\n\n## In Technical Matters - the Devil Is in The Details\n\nThe problem with management systems is that they are too broad and generic to\nbe of any practical use.\n\n> A management system is broad and sweeping in its generalities. But technical\n> problems are a matter of detail, The devil is in the details, Management\n> systems cannot help when the difficulties are technical. A badly designed\n> machine on which the safety of the ship and its crew may depend is\n> impervious to the blandishments of a management system. But a badly designed\n> machine will yield an exhaustive analysis by a technically trained man\n\n## Thought Experiment: What if Columbus Had Applied Modern Management\nTechniques to His Voyage?\n\nRickover makes a powerful point about the ridiculousness of the modern\nmanagement approach to challenges:\n\n> What if Columbus had applied modern management systems to his proposed\n> voyage? He would have attended management seminars. He would have studied\n> tables with brightly colored squares and broad arrows to show which way\n> plans, decisions, and problems were to go. He would not have bothered with\n> details such as navigation and seamanship. These were technical matters. He\n> would simply have \"managed\" the voyage. He would have used a colored-plastic\n> decision-making card. Further, his analyst\u2014I mean systems analyst\u2014would have\n> presented him with several volumes proving that the venture was not cost-\n> effective. America would never have been discovered. We would all be\n> Indians.\n\n## Elaborate Management Systems Dull Purpose and Competence\n\nThe disastrous effect of management systems is that they dull purpose and\ncompetence, rather than enhancing it.\n\n> It is hard to describe how pervasive management systems are; and how they\n> have dulled the sharp edge of purpose and competence. Nor are line officers\n> the only ones to depend on the teachings of modern management. A recent\n> Chief of the Bureau of Ships told his engineers that their key role was\n> management in & the technological revolution, He did not deny the need for\n> technically trained people but stated that management was the job of\n> engineering officers in Washington. Moreover, he noted approvingly that\n> engineers, more used to dealing with verifiable facts, had participated in\n> courses to enable them to deal efficiently with unpredictable human beings.\n> In my experience, there are not many facts in a rapidly advancing field.\n> Finding out what they are consumes all the time of a good engineer. It is\n> upon knowing these technical facts that the Navy depends not upon people\n> taken from their jobs to become skilled at human relations.\n\n## Management Teaches People to Avoid the Central Problem at Hand\n\nThe central thing required to solve problems is usually effort.\n\nWhat management systems do is, help people give excuses on why they should\navoid the effort.\n\n> Management is taught at Annapolis. This has done serious harm to its young\n> graduates. My people and I interview midshipmen before they enter the\n> nuclear program. We do this because it takes time, effort, and expense to\n> train an officer to operate nuclear ships. We cannot afford to penalize men\n> who are working hard to learn atomic power plant technology by wasting our\n> resources on individuals who have been taught the easy social science\n> courses, or who cannot or will not make demands upon themselves.\n\n## Management Studies Builds up A Lazy, Aristocratic Approach\n\nRickover noticed that people with Management Studies training tend to be\ndivorced from reality.\n\n> We must also select men who will seek facts and face them. Officers in\n> nuclear ships cannot rely on theory alone. One midshipman, who had taken\n> management courses, told me that he was able to learn my job in six months;\n> he could run General Electric in a year. It was not his fault. It was no\n> crime for him to give this answer. He had been taught by his supposedly\n> responsible and knowledgeable professors that his job was to \"manage,\" It\n> will take some of these men years to unlearn the Annapolis social science\n> propaganda, and some never will. What is tragic is that often these young\n> men have good potential as naval officers. They report to the Academy\n> expecting to be taught the elements of the naval profession and have no\n> reason to expect otherwise. Instead, they learn that a naval officer\n> shouldn't bother with technical details. All he needs to know are broad\n> concepts on how to manage. Someone else will do the work. There will always\n> be available to him a sufficient number of cheerful, willing, competent,\n> hard-working \"serfs\" to do the technical work, as well as the money to do\n> the job. He will be the leader, the aristocrat.\n\n## Management Studies Often Encourage Building Up a Cult in Thought\n\nRickover was always afraid of a sheltered view of life.\n\nIn the Navy business, refusal to update views based on updated situations\nmeant death.\n\nSo he could see the dangers posed by the doctrinal orientations of management\nthought.\n\n> There exists a great temptation in a man's life to commit himself to the\n> dogma of his youth and to base his entire life's work on that dogmatic\n> foundation. This temptation is fostered by the cult of management, and this\n> is why management studies should be banned from the Naval Academy. Many of\n> its graduates, leading the sheltered naval life, never reexamine this\n> doctrine; never afterward do they fully experience the world of reality.\n> They would be lost if suddenly the dogma handed down should prove to be\n> fallacious\n\n## Engineering Requires a Continuous Questioning & Renewal of Views\n\nOne of the great reasons for practicing Engineering personally for me is: the\nhonesty demanded in the field.\n\nOne must adhere to nature, and its constraints.\n\nOne must deal with society and people's needs correctly, or be kicked out.\n\nRigour keeps the engineer honest.\n\n> Though we may stop asking questions the day we obtain our diplomas, the Navy\n> we are committed to serve and enhance will not. It keeps asking us whether\n> we know what we are doing; it keeps asking us why the Navy we have desired\n> and built over the past 50 years is in its present state.\n\n## Knowing the Details of The Job > \"World Outlook\"\n\nAs a hardened engineering leader, Rickover understood the importance of paying\nattention to the minutest details of the job.\n\nHe accepted the importance of time-honored attributes like hard-work, honesty,\nexcellence and such things.\n\nBut other than that he clearly rejected impractical approaches such as\noperating on the \"world outlook\" of his team.\n\n> There are also signs that the Naval War College has lost its sense of\n> purpose. That college was founded in 1884 to give a few naval officers a\n> chance to think about strategy. But today strategy is one among other\n> themes. For example, in the Naval War College Review of January 1872, the\n> lead article was entitled \"A Revolution in Organization Concepts.\" A single\n> sentence sums up the author's philosophy: 'A person's ability to manage his\n> affairs or those of any public or private organization or institution\n> depends less on the methods, techniques, and tools he employs than on his\n> understanding of, and attitudes toward, the world that contains him and the\n> groups of which he is a part.\" Put another way, he is saying that an\n> attitude is more important than knowing the details of a job. The article's\n> author has taught in several colleges here and abroad, and at one point was\n> a professor of city planning and a co-author of a book on management. But\n> would you go to a doctor who believes his \"world outlook\" is more important\n> than his medical knowledge?\n\n## The Engineer Must Solve the Problem in Fact, Not on Paper\n\nClaims made on paper must be considered weaker than claims made through actual\nperformance.\n\nA working system is of far superior value due to its power to function and\nproduce results.\n\nWe must respect this aspect as engineers.\n\nYou must fight at sea, not on paper.\n\n> Contrast this philosophy with that of another article in the same issue of\n> the Review. It describes how Admiral Joseph Mason Reeves, who was Commander\n> of the United States Fleet in 1934, gathered officers of all ranks for a\n> lecture at the War College. He told them: \"In everything we do, we must ask\n> ourselves: does this directly advance preparation for war? ...if war comes,\n> this Fleet must fight 'as is.\" You must fight at sea and not on paper.\"\n> These two examples from the Review go to the heart of the matter\u2014one is\n> professional advice from an experienced naval officer; the other is not. .\n\n## More Complex the Work, Greater the Need for Initiative\n\nModern management seems to have no place for special talent and deep\nexperience.\n\nPeople can be replaced easily with someone else, in theory.\n\nBut in deep knowledge based industries this is impossible.\n\nProcess cannot replace initiative.\n\nYou need intelligent people heading complex initiatives, giving it their all\nto succeed.\n\n> Human experience shows that people, not organizations or management systems,\n> get things done. For this reason, subordinates must be given authority and\n> responsibility early in their careers. In this way they develop quickly and\n> can help the manager do his work. The manager, of course, remains ultimately\n> responsible and must accept the blame if subordinates make mistakes.\n\n## Promote the Technically Knowledgeable Into Leadership Positions\n\nIn Engineering teams, just like in surgery teams, you need expert leadership.\n\nA non-technical leader, just like a non-surgeon leader, will be too slow, make\nfaulty judgments under pressure, and lead to painful results.\n\n> The Navy is raising a generation of officers who believe that technical\n> training is not essential and that they can rely on management techniques to\n> make decisions. For these officers, the road to advancement in many cases\n> leads through the non-professional areas of the Navy, such as political-\n> military affairs, foreign sales, planning and budgeting, and human\n> relations. Further, they want subordinates with whom they can be comfortable\n> rather than those who are qualified. On the other hand, the Russians do not\n> put management experts into highly technical positions. A recent Soviet\n> listing indicates that the head of the Russian space program is a design\n> engineer who has been associated with Soviet rocket development since World\n> War II.\n\n## Engineering Problems Cannot Be Solved Through Personal Will Alone\n\nWhat Engineering and Science teach us is about the limits and realities of the\nworld, and learning to respect those constraints, while working around them.\n\nPeople used to management systems and processes, and those divorced from\nreality, are not accustomed to dealing with the obstacles of engineering.\n\n> My people and I find that the technical bases for these proposals are\n> unsound. When we object to these schemes on scientific and engineering\n> grounds, we are told that we are unimaginative and stubbornly conservative,\n> that we could make these systems work if we really tried and wanted to do\n> so. Such an argument reduces all engineering to the simple matter of\n> personal will. We are constantly faced with people who believe in the idea\n> of overcoming existing difficulties by trying something even bolder and more\n> difficult. Like all exaggerated gallantry, such a course is attractive but\n> unrewarding.\n\n## Set up A Lifelong Sequence of Challenges - a Never-Ending Challenge\n\nRickover recommends continuously raising the bar for the engineers and\nmanagers.\n\nThere must be a never-ending challenge of engineering to keep the team going\nfor a lifetime.\n\n> As subordinates develop, work should be constantly added so that no one can\n> finish his job. This serves as a prod and a challenge. It brings out their\n> capabilities and frees the manager to assume added responsibilities. As\n> members of the organization become capable of assuming new and more\n> difficult duties, they develop pride in doing the job well. This attitude\n> soon permeates the entire organization.\n\n## Keep Increasing the Responsibility of the Engineer & Help Them Develop\nAbility\n\nAgain - an engineer must not be thought of as a bricklayer, who can be bossed\naround.\n\nThe engineer must have broad responsibility, the freedom to think and act.\n\nThey must make their own mistakes, recover from them, and grow in wisdom.\n\n> One must permit his people the freedom to seek added work and greater\n> responsibility. In my organization, there are no formal job descriptions or\n> organizational charts. Responsibilities are defined in a general way so that\n> people are not circumscribed. All are permitted to do as they think best and\n> to go to anyone and anywhere for help. Each person then is limited only by\n> his own ability.\n\n## Dealing with Challenges Over Long Term Makes Formidable Engineers\n\nA central motivation for the engineer is challenge, and the mental high\nobtained when difficulties are overcome via ingenuity.\n\nAlso -- putting long-term efforts to overcome major obstacles is a source of\ncommitment.\n\nThe manager must encourage such an attitude.\n\n> Complex jobs cannot be accomplished effectively with transients. Therefore,\n> a manager must make the work challenging and rewarding so that his people\n> will remain with the organization for many years. This allows it to benefit\n> fully from their knowledge, experience, and corporate memory.\n\n> The Defense Department does not recognize the need for continuity in\n> important jobs. It rotates officers every few years both at headquarters and\n> in the field. The same applies to their civilian superiors.\n\n> This system virtually ensures inexperience and nonaccountability. By the\n> time an officer has begun to learn a job, it is time for him to rotate.\n> Under this system, incumbents can blame their problems on predecessors. They\n> are assigned to another job before the results of their work become evident.\n> Subordinates cannot be expected to remain committed to a job and perform\n> effectively when they are continuously adapting to a new job or a new boss.\n\n## If the Manager Doesn't Care or Commit, Nobody Does As Well\n\nDue to monetary inducements and incentives, people lose their long-term vision\nand capability to execute on the same direction for longer periods.\n\nThis is not good for the organization and the profession (or the individual\ntoo on a long-term basis).\n\nWe must learn to care about the projects we work on & develop the commitment\nto see them through to the conclusion.\n\n> When doing a job\u2014any job\u2014one must feel that he owns it, and act as though he\n> will remain in the job forever. He must look after his work just as\n> conscientiously, as though it were his own business and his own money. If he\n> feels he is only a temporary custodian, or that the job is just a stepping\n> stone to a higher position, his actions will not take into account the long-\n> term interests of the organization. His lack of commitment to the present\n> job will be perceived by those who work for him, and they, likewise, will\n> tend not to care. Too many spend their entire working lives looking for\n> their next job. When one feels he owns his present job and acts that way, he\n> needs to have no concern about his next job.\n\n## When Something Goes Wrong - Who Is to Blame - Who Is Responsible?\n\nIn industry, we often see failing projects, but there is no single person who\nis responsible.\n\nTurns out, nobody truly wanted to see it done. There is a crisis of\nresponsibility in the world at large.\n\nThere is a lack of commitment. There is a deficit in taking 100% ownership.\n\nStructure projects in such a way that there is one person responsible when\nthings go wrong.\n\nIf everyone is theoretically responsible, in practice is nobody is!\n\n> Unless the individual truly responsible can be identified when something\n> goes wrong, no one has really been responsible. With the advent of modern\n> management theories, it is becoming common for organizations to deal with\n> problems in a collective manner, by dividing programs into subprograms, with\n> no one left responsible for the entire effort. There is also the tendency to\n> establish more and more levels of management, on the theory that this gives\n> better control. These are but different forms of shared responsibility,\n> which easily lead to no one being responsible\u2014a problem that often inheres\n> in large corporations as well as in the Defense Department.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA problem with me is that I could go on quoting the Admiral's wisdom with no\nend in sight. The space available for this week's post is limited, therefore I\nmust stop.\n\nSo at this point, I will encourage everyone who deals with engineering matters\nto learn more about Admiral Rickover. You can find some starting points right\nwithin our blog, Hexmos Journal, to embark on a learning journey.\n\nWhat do you think of my choice to project Rickover as the Newton of\nEngineering Management? Do you have any other personalities, either historical\nor contemporary who fit the bill?
