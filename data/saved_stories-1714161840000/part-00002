To begin, visit https://chat.alphacorp.ai and sign up for an\naccount. If the 100-user limit has not been reached, you will be automatically\nredirected to our chat application where you can start using your new account\nimmediately. Should the limit be reached, your email will be added to our\nwaitlist, and we will notify you via email as soon as more slots become\navailable.\n\nWe have categorized the levels of AI models ranging from 1 to 3, with 3 being\nthe current market leaders with the highest benchmark ratings, and 1 being the\nfastest and least powerful, but still very intelligent, AI models. The\ncharacter limit counts both input and output: the number of characters you\nsend in one message and the number of characters you receive from the model\nare added to your total usage.\n\nThe \u201cAsk Another AI\u201d feature, available on AlphaCorp AI Chat, enhances your\nexperience by allowing you to get multiple perspectives on a single query.\nAfter receiving a response from your initially chosen model, you can click a\nbutton above your last message to select a different model for another\nresponse. This unique feature enables you to compare answers from various\nmodels directly within the same chat window, helping you to determine the most\naccurate or suitable solution for your needs. It\u2019s a convenient way to\nevaluate different AI insights in real-time, all within one application.\n\nThe Model-to-Model Chat Simulation is an innovative feature of AlphaCorp AI\nChat, designed to allow two AI chat models to engage in a conversation with\neach other. After receiving a response from one chat model, you can initiate\nthis simulation by clicking the \u201cReply with AI\u201d button located beneath the\nlast message and selecting another chat model for its response. This action\nsets off a \u201ccycle\u201d where the chosen models exchange replies back and forth.\nYou have the option to keep triggering this cycle by pressing the button,\ngenerating additional responses to observe the unfolding discussion. This\nfeature provides a unique way to explore how different AI models interact and\ndevelop a conversation dynamically.\n\nOur app currently supports a diverse range of chat models to cater to various\nneeds and preferences. The available models include:\n\n  * ChatGPT3.5\n  * ChatGPT4\n  * Mistral-Tiny\n  * Mistral-Small\n  * Mistral-Medium\n  * Llama2-13b\n  * Llama2-70b\n  * Jurassic2-Ultra\n  * GeminiPro\n\nThis selection ensures users have access to a wide spectrum of AI\ncapabilities, from lightweight models for quick responses to more advanced\noptions for complex inquiries.\n\nAlphaCorp AI is currently a solo project.
