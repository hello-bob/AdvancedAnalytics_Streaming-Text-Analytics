It slowly became clear that Io, which is a bit smaller than\nMercury, is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, with all\nthat activity driven by the gravitational strain caused by Jupiter and its\nthree other giant moons. There is so much volcanism that its surface has been\ncompletely remodeled, with no signs of impact craters.\n\nA few more details about its violence came to light this week, with new images\nbeing released of the moon's features, including an island in a lake of lava,\ntaken by the Juno orbiter. At the same time, imaging done using an Earth-based\ntelescope has provided some indications that this volcanism has been reshaping\nIo from almost the moment it formed.\n\n## Fiery, glassy lakes\n\nThe Juno orbiter's mission is primarily focused on studying Jupiter, including\nthe dynamics of its storms and its internal composition. But many of its\norbital passes have taken it right past Io, and this week, the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory released some of the best images from these flybys. They include a\nshot of Loki Patera, a lake of lava that has an island within it. Also\nfeatured: the impossibly sheer slopes of Io's Steeple Mountain.\n\nLooking more closely at the lake, the Juno team found that some of the areas\nwithin it were incredibly smooth, raising the possibility that obsidian glass\nhad formed on the surface where it had cooled enough to solidify. Given the\nlevel of volcanism on Io, this may be more widespread than the Loki Patera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVolcanic ash would also create a relatively smooth surface, and is likely to\nbe even more common, but it would have significantly different reflective\nproperties.\n\n## How long has this been going on?\n\nBut we don't have to send hardware to Jupiter to learn something about Io. A\nUS-based team got time on the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and used\nit to record emissions from atoms in Io's sparse atmosphere. By combining the\nimaging power of lots of smaller telescopes scattered across a plateau, ALMA\nis able to spot regional differences in the presence of specific elements in\nIo's atmosphere, as well as identify different isotopes of those elements.\n\nWhat can isotopes tell us? Any atoms that reach Io's upper atmosphere are at\nrisk of being lost to space. And, because of their relative atomic weights,\nlighter isotopes have a higher probability of being lost. So, it's possible to\ncompare the present ratio of elements in the atmosphere with the expected\nratio, and we can make inferences about the history of loss of lighter\nisotopes. And, since the material is put into the atmosphere by volcanoes in\nthe first place, that tells us something about the history of volcanism.\n\nThe research team focused on two particular elements: sulfur and chlorine.\nSulfur has two common non-radioactive isotopes, ^32S and ^34S, and chlorine,\nits neighbor on the periodic table, has ^35Cl and ^37Cl. There are differences\nin the ratio of these isotopes throughout the bodies of the Solar System, but\nthose differences are generally small. And, because we think we know what sort\nof material contributed to the formation of Io, we can focus on the ratios\nfound in bodies that have a similar origin.\n\nChlorine enters the atmosphere from volcanoes primarily in the form of sodium\nand potassium salts. These have a very short half-life before they're split up\nby exposure to light and radiation. The ALMA data indicated both these\nchemicals were present in localized regions, likely corresponding to active\nvolcanic plumes. The data from the chlorine isotopes were a bit noisy, so were\nlargely used as a sanity check for the ones obtained from sulfur isotopes.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n62\n\nJohn Timmer John is Ars Technica's science editor.
