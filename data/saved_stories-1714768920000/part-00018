The latter has reportedly been raising billions to\nsupport a network of fabs, datacenters, and power plants to fuel his AI\nambitions.\n\n\"If you believe that the market is going to move from the previous forecasts\nof maybe $80 billion dollars at the advanced node, to $150 billion, it doesn't\ntake a large market share to make Rapidus a great success,\" Richard adds.\n\n### Rapidus rising\n\nIf you're not familiar with Rapidus, the Japanese foundry upstart is a\nrelatively new player having gotten its start in 2022. It began construction\nof its IIM-1 plant in Hokkaido in September, which will produce wafers based\non an advanced 2nm process node developed in collaboration with IBM.\n\nArmed with $6.1 billion in funding from the Japanese government, Richard says\nthe foundry biz is on track to complete construction later this year and begin\ninstalling equipment early next. Following installation, Rapidus will begin\nthe technology transfer of IBMs process tech, being developed in parallel at\nits research facility in Albany, New York.\n\n\"We are on our way to have close to 200 engineers in Albany that are working\non the technology and preparing the transfer,\" Richard says, adding that pilot\nproduction at the Hokkaido plant is set to begin in 2026 followed by volume\nproduction in 2027.\n\nMost recently, Rapidus opened an office in Silicon Valley which is focused on\nsales, business development, marketing, and tech support for potential\nclients. Early contract wins included Canadian RISC-V chip dev Tenstorrent,\nwhich plans to produce its AI accelerator in Rapidus' fabs.\n\n### The competitive landscape\n\nRapidus aims to establish itself as an alternative source of advanced\nsemiconductor manufacturing. However, achieving this goal may not be so easy\nas it faces stiff competition from the likes of Samsung, TSMC, and Intel.\n\nOne of the company's biggest challenges relates to timing. TSMC, Samsung, and\nIntel are slated to being shipping their 2nm process tech in 2025 with volume\nproduction expected for 2026. In fact, Intel expects to ship internal chips\nbuilt using its 20A node \u2014 its 2nm equivalent \u2014 later this year, followed by\nits mass market 18A node next year.\n\nThis puts Rapidus at least a year behind its competition, a fact Richard\nacknowledges. However, process tech isn't the only consideration these days,\nhe argues.\n\n\"We might come to an inflection point where, if you just judge a fab, based on\nwhen a node is available for mass production, it's a very partial view of the\ncompetitiveness of the offering.\"\n\nIt's no secret that performance or efficiency gains from process shrinks,\nsomething that we used to take for granted, have become far less impressive as\nMoore's Law has slowed. Emerging and maturing technologies like backside power\ndelivery, advanced packaging, and next-gen substrates are expected to play a\nbigger role in driving performance and efficiency than transistor density in\nthe future.\n\nRichard was hesitant on sharing details on the specific technologies Rapidus\nis currently exploring beyond its work on process tech with IBM, but says more\ndetails would be coming later this year.\n\nRegardless of whether these technologies prove a competitive advantage, he\nsays, capacity constraints alone should be more than enough to guarantee\nRapidus' success, he opines.\n\n### An AI friendly fab\n\nFrom the get-go, Rapidus is focusing on three main markets: serving those\nbuilding traditional CPUs and GPUs; those designing edge compute; and thirdly,\nand most importantly, AI chip startups that don't yet have the volume to make\nsense for TSMC.\n\n\"I think that we are still underestimating the impact and the opportunity that\nAI represents in terms of semiconductor demand,\" Richard says.\n\n\"There is a very large and growing number of AI companies that don't have\nhistorical volumes, but represent a pretty good potential for Rapidus,\" he\nadds. \"They're concerned that they would be limited in their ability to be\nfairly serviced.\"\n\nRichard aims to capitalize on these smaller customers by providing additional\nguidance and support that they might not otherwise get from competing fabs.\n\n  * Micron scores $6.1B CHIPS Act cash for New York and Idaho fabs\n  * ASML ships another high NA EUV lithography machine to mystery client\n  * Intel's effort to build a foundry biz is costing far more \u2013 and taking longer \u2013 than expected\n  * TSMC scores $11.6B funding infusion for Arizona fabs, now plans for third plant\n\nMany of these customers, he contends, aren't actually concerned about getting\ntheir hands on the latest process tech.\n\n\"I come from an era where everything was, you know, about the semiconductor\nitself, the transistor, the process, the node, AMD vs Intel, the big battle of\nthe fabs, and all that,\" Richard says.\n\n\"Frankly, when you talk to those AI companies, semiconductors are kind of a\nnecessary evil. They're not motivated by the silicon; they're motivated by\nwhat can they do with the silicon.\"\n\nRapidus' early focus on smaller, indie chipmakers is grounded in the reality\nthat it's not going to be able to service that many customers until it gains\nmore experience and builds out its capacity.\n\n\"When we ramp up the fab, legitimately, we can't serve more than, what, half a\ndozen customers to do our job properly at the onset, and then we'll have\nmore,\" Richard says.\n\n### A geopolitical and economic play\n\nAnother element that shouldn't be missed here is the ongoing effort by local\ngovernments to secure semiconductor supply chains and on-shore production.\n\nThe US in particular has raised the alarm bell regarding the concentration of\nsemiconductor production in Taiwan and South Korea. Chief among these concerns\nis that an invasion of Taiwan by China, which already views the island nation\nas sovereign territory, could upend the world economy and leave the US at a\ndisadvantage.\n\nThese concerns ultimately led to the passage of the US CHIPS Act, which made\n$53 billion available to fund the construction of domestic chip fabs and\nresearch and development. The bill was followed by a \u20ac43 billion European\nequivalent and drove Japan's investment, which is said to amount to as much as\n$67 billion in order to bolster its semiconductor capacity.\n\nWhile TSMC and Samsung were quick to announce US fabs years before the America\npassed its chips funding, Richard tells The Register that a US fab probably\nisn't in the cards, at least not any time soon.\n\n\"We've never spoken about anything in the US, and I don't think that's in the\nplan. I would say never say never, but it's so outside of the timeline of\nrelevance,\" he says.\n\nHaving said that, silicon supply chains and national security can't be\nignored. \"It's a very big component that nobody wants to speak about, too\nloudly,\" Richard says.\n\n\"I think we're in a great position to be seen as a diversification of\ngeographical risk, while being close enough to the US to be seen as a friendly\nsupplier.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Japan\n  * Samsung\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Japan\n  * Samsung\n  * Semiconductor\n  * TSMC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * ASML\n  * Broadcom\n  * Cadence Design Systems\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Hot Chips\n  * JAXA\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Loongson\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * NXP Semiconductors\n  * Samsung Galaxy\n  * Samsung Galaxy Ace\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Star Wars\n  * STMicroelectronics\n  * Tachyum\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Toyota\n  * United Microelectronics Corporation\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n2 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Japan\n  * Samsung\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Japan\n  * Samsung\n  * Semiconductor\n  * TSMC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * ASML\n  * Broadcom\n  * Cadence Design Systems\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Hot Chips\n  * JAXA\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Loongson\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * NXP Semiconductors\n  * Samsung Galaxy\n  * Samsung Galaxy Ace\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Semiconductor Memory\n  * Star Wars\n  * STMicroelectronics\n  * Tachyum\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Toyota\n  * United Microelectronics Corporation\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Japan will use AI to find out what bears do in the woods\n\nBecause nobody wants a big surprise\n\nPublic Sector2 days | 20\n\n#### Google Search results polluted by buggy AI-written code frustrate coders\n\nAnalysis Pulumi claims it has culled bad infrastructure-as-code samples\n\nAI + ML2 days | 38\n\n#### Here\u2019s another thing AI can do: Return Samsung\u2019s memory biz to profit\n\nHBM will help too.
