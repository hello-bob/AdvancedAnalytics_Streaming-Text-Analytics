They are now looking to make it more\nindependent. Many XApps are already packaged for other Linux distributions but\nless so used by default.\n\nTheir hope is with a more independent XApp that they can collaborate more with\nother Linux distributions and see more contributions from other parties. As\npart of this they are looking for XApp to have its own GitHub repositories,\nown website, etc.\n\nAs part of the Adwaita library catering just to GNOME's needs and apps relying\non libAdwaita really being focused on GNOME, they are looking at forking more\nolder GTK3 versions of different GNOME applications to maintain them as part\nof XApp. Among the new applications they are looking at forking are Celluloid,\nGNOME Calculator, Simple Scan, Baobab, System Monitor, GNOME Calendar, and\nFile Roller.\n\nThe Linux Mint April update goes on to note:\n\n> \"libAdwaita is for GNOME and GNOME only. We can\u2019t blame GNOME for this,\n> they\u2019ve been very clear about it from the start. It was made specifically\n> for GNOME to have more freedom and build its own ecosystem without impacting\n> GTK.\n>\n> We want to send a strong signal upstream and towards other projects. We\n> cannot and will not support applications which do not support our users and\n> environments.\n>\n> We can\u2019t promote applications to our users which don\u2019t support our users.\n> The software manager will be vigilant towards that going forward and list\n> compatible software by default.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see how these additional forks evolve and how much\ninterest there is from other Linux distributions/parties around a more\nindependent XApp project.\n\n50 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nRust-Written Redox OS Gets USB Keyboards & Mice Working\n\nTrueNAS SCALE 24.04 Released For A Wonderful NAS Platform\n\nRocky Linux To Support Upstream Stable Kernels\n\nAlmaLinux 9.4 Beta Restores Support For Some Hardware Deprecated By RHEL\n\nGentoo Linux Now An SPI Project\n\nLinux Mint Aims For More Reliable & Faster Repository Access\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
