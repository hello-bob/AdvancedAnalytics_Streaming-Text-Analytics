Captivated by these diminutive beings, Harvest not only\nkept them as pets but to the surprise and wonder of others she trained them to\nrespond to her calls and perform tricks, earning her the esteemed \u201cSmallest\nPet\u201d award annually through her early school years, and bringing the\nintelligence of waterbugs into question.\n\nLater in life, during her time in creating in Venice, a city also intimately\nintertwined with water, Harvest became acutely aware of the troubling\nphenomenon of colony collapse disorder and the rapid decline in honeybee\npopulations. Recognizing the crucial role that bees play in pollinating plants\nand sustaining ecosystems, she became a beekeeper and conceived an ambitious\nproject to establish the Murano Honey Garden in Venice. Despite facing\nskepticism from others that it could be done, Harvest remained resolute,\npropelled by her passion for conservation and her conviction in the\ntransformative potential of art and nature.\n\nCreating a garden that attracts and supports bees, thereby contributing to the\nhealth of the local ecosystem, is challenging enough in most locations, but\nthe logistical hurdles in Venice are particularly daunting. From bringing in\ntons of soil, to carefully selecting and locating a diverse array of bee-\nfriendly fruit trees and aromatic plants that would thrive and have prolonged\nblooming periods in Venice, to sourcing healthy adapted honeybees and\nconstructing their shelters.\n\nIn 2013, again to the amazement of many, Judi Harvest opened The Honey Garden,\na vibrant and welcoming garden that promotes the welfare of bees and aromatic\nplants, transforming a forgotten field behind the Giorgio Giuman glass\nfactory, in Murano, Italy into a permanent art installation hosted in the\nGiuman furnace.\n\nThis April I had the opportunity to visit her at the Honey Garden in Venice\nand talk with her about her efforts and challenges to create it.\n\nGayil Nalls: How did you begin?\n\nJudi Harvest: When I decided to build the Murano Honey Garden on the forgotten\nfield behind the Giorgio Giuman glass factory in Sacca Serenella, Murano, I\nknew I needed three essential things: fresh soil, pollinator-friendly flowers\nand plants and of course healthy honeybee colonies!\n\nThe first adventure was finding fresh, new soil after I excavated around 12-18\ninches of glass-filled soil. The roots of the plants and trees could be\ncompromised otherwise.\n\nI was told there was a man named Gianni with a boat full of soil, a crane and\ntractor that passed by occasionally. I waited outside the factory on the\nwater, day after day until one day I saw him and yelled \u201cGianni viene qui\u201d\n(come here!)\n\nHe pulled over the huge transport boat and looked at the field and told me I\nneeded 6 boatloads of soil. I had no budget, no sponsors and to this day, the\nHoney Garden is supported by sales of my artworks, donations and Murano Honey\nsales. I believed 3 boat loads would be enough. Who knew what the boatload of\nsoil exactly was? We don\u2019t have this measuring system in the US. At 6:00 am\nthe next day he phoned me to come see the garden, he was right 3 was not\nenough. Six boatloads later we were ready to plant the flowers and trees.\n\n\u00a9Judi Harvest\n\nAfter you cleared the ground of this rough site and brought in garden soil,\nyou were prepared for plants.\n\nAfter the soil, I needed the right plants. There\u2019s no place like Home Depot or\na garden center or something like that in the city of Venice or on any of the\nnearby islands where tourists or locals go. There is an island called\nTreporti, which is a port, which has a marina, fishing, boats, and lots of\ngreenhouses where they grow things and sell them. Marco Giuman, Giorgio\nGiuman\u2019s son, the glassmaster I worked with and the family for 36 years now,\nlives in Treporti. He says when he\u2019s walking to the vaporetto, there\u2019s a\ngreenhouse and garden center place near the vaporetto that he sees, and he\nwould accompany me there. One day after work, they stopped working at 3:45, by\n4:15, he was ready to leave the factory. We take the boat that goes to\nTreporti, from the Faro, which is the lighthouse in Murano.\n\nWe walk there, we get the boat. Now it\u2019s about 4:30, 4:45. Rainy again, as I\nmentioned, a horrible season... just horrible. I was lucky that it rained\nbecause we needed the water, but it was tough for me to do this project with\nthe elements that I was facing. Even hail. We get there and it\u2019s now slightly\ndark, and we walk from the vaporetto, which is about a 20-minute walk straight\ndown the road. We find this place and the guy is wanting to close up, but he\nlets us in because we called. He didn\u2019t know if we were showing up, I guess.\nHe gives us flashlights and we go through his greenhouses. I had a list\nbecause I had spoken with the gardener, Charles Day, at Wave Hill when I had\nan exhibition there and made friends with Charles and also Roger Repohl, who\nwas the beekeeper there.\n\nThe three of us sat down at a table, and he had done some research about the\nplants that I would need for bees there and gave me the list. I go with this\nlist to Treporti, and I say, \u201cClaudio, this is what I need.\u201d And he chuckles,\ngood luck with that list I thought. He says, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s take the\nflashlights.\u201d We had on our high-water boots because there was a lot of mud.\nThat\u2019s why he kept saying, \u201cDon\u2019t come today. There\u2019s mud. Don\u2019t come today,\nthere\u2019s mud.\u201d Finally, I just said, \u201cI have the boots. I\u2019m coming. Mud, no\nmud, I\u2019m out of time.\u201d So, I put on my boots, which I seem to wear a lot\nthere. It\u2019s often wet both in the factory and in the garden. This is a tip for\nwhen you visit. If you don\u2019t have boots, you can buy them in Venice and you\u2019ll\nlikely need them. It doesn\u2019t matter the season now, because the water is\nalways rising. Even with MOSE, the Venetian damming project. We live with a\nconstant awareness of Venice\u2019s fragility to climate change.\n\nWe find the plants, including rosemary, lavender, jasmine, roses, sage, thyme,\nwisteria, and more. Claudio puts them on these large trolleys and tells me the\nnext day he is going to bring them. I asked him, \u201cHow much do you think they\nare?\u201d And he says he\u2019ll figure it out. He looked honest. I looked nervous.\nDidn\u2019t matter. I was in this too deep to turn back. So on the way out, I said,\n\u201cWait a second. I want this tree, a pomegranate tree.\u201d It was growing in a\nlarge tub. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s my tree.\u201d I said. \u201cListen, the deal\u2019s off, no\npomegranate tree, no plants.\u201d He thought about it and said, \u201cThis is a\n150-year-old pomegranate tree. I said, \u201cOh, please Claudio, I just can see\nthis in the garden, like welcoming arms and it\u2019s a symbol of prosperity and\nabundance, I need this tree.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So the tree had to come in by crane over the walls of the\ngarden and then be dragged to its position. And now I\u2019m in this field that was\na dumping ground for glass. I did a little sketch and I thought, more or less,\nI\u2019m going to try to create this sketch. But when the pomegranate tree came in,\nit changed everything. It was like one element in a painting. You knew it\nneeded that structure in the center. And it has grown and produces around 40\npomegranates a year. It became a symbol in my work. I make glass pomegranates\nand I make the seeds. That led to another project, an exhibition called\nPropagation Bees and Seeds, where I made everything that grows in the garden\nin glass. Inspired by the installation at Harvard by the Blaschka brothers,\nwho knew that certain flowers would disappear and dried flowers don\u2019t last\nforever. So they were commissioned to make them in glass actually twice,\nbecause with shipping, the first batch were damaged and destroyed when they\ngot through customs at the airport. But the next time they hand-carried them\non the plane. I know how that can be. I work in glass because it further\nsymbolizes the fragility of life and the search for beauty in my work. Murano\nglass has beautiful qualities that involve the minerals from the earth. With\nthe Honey Garden I am giving something back to the earth where my inspiration\nand art supplies come from. People really enjoy coming there to visit and\ninteract with nature, the honeybees, and the glass masters.\n\nThe pomegranate tree is an important symbol for me in the garden. The\npomegranates it produces are amazing. They\u2019re huge\u2013 the size of grapefruits. I\nwait and wait and wait for them to become the right color, and by that time I\nusually have to leave Venice, so everyone in the factory gets to eat and enjoy\nthem.\n\nI\u2019m always hesitant to eat them myself because they look so beautiful on the\ntree that I leave them. The birds and bees eat them too. The bees, oh my\ngoodness\u2013 one day one had cracked open because it was mature, and all these\nhoneybees were inside. That year I was trying to figure out if they made\npomegranate honey or not, because we harvest the honey usually in September,\nend of August, once a year, but couldn\u2019t really tell ... We do analyze it to\nmake sure it doesn\u2019t have pesticides. We send a jar to Padua every year to a\nlaboratory, and it\u2019s always passed that process and that\u2019s important. I want\nmy bees and their honey to be pesticide-free. My garden is pesticide-free but\nI want to make sure they\u2019re not getting exposure from elsewhere.\n\nAfter planting most of the trees and flowers, what was your next step?\n\nBees are a keystone species. Of the 20,000 species of bees in the world, only\n8 species are honeybees, but they all are facing a lot of challenges to stay\nalive.\n\nMy next task was to obtain healthy bees to complete the project. However,\nfinding beekeepers willing to part with their native honeybees in Venice\nwasn\u2019t easy. Despite being given a few names and searching online, my initial\nattempts were unsuccessful. One beekeeper I met in Jesolo couldn\u2019t sell or\nprovide me with bees because his bees were stressed due to ongoing\nconstruction in the lagoon known as MOSE, aimed at preventing Venice from\nflooding. The vibrations from the construction were disturbing the bees,\naffecting their rest and foraging patterns.\n\nFeeling disheartened but not giving up, I heard about a beekeeper on the\nisland of Sant Erasmo named Elio Mavaracchio, who was famous but unlikely to\nhelp. Nevertheless, I decided to reach out to him, hoping for a chance.\nDespite challenges like pouring rain, lots of mud, and uncertainty about\nfinding his place, I persisted and arrived on the island. Eventually, I\nencountered a car on the road and after asking for directions, I discovered it\nwas Elio himself.\n\nBumping along, he graciously took me to his hexagon-shaped house, where I was\namazed to see a multitude of colored beehives, numbering around 200 or 250.\n\u201cAre you hungry? he asked me. I was hungry but it was getting dark and I\nwanted to talk to him about bees.\u201d Suddenly, I was washing radicchio and he\u2019s\nmaking risotto. I asked to go outside and see the bees. However, Elio kept\nexpressing concerns about the condition of his beehives, noting issues with\neach one. Despite this, I pleaded for just four hives, offering to pay for\nthem.\n\nAfter sharing a meal and discussing the idea with his partner Veronica, Elio\nagreed to set up four beehives. Days later, they carefully transported the\nbeehives by boat to the garden, and our friendship continued. Thus began a\nremarkable journey, notwithstanding its challenges. These bees have great\ngenetics, so in time, the number of hives multiplied, new queens emerged, and\nswarms occurred. Despite occasional setbacks, I am thankful for my four-\nthriving hives. Beekeeping embodies a symbiotic relationship founded on\nkindness and respect. Luca Polo, a dedicated beekeeper, plays a crucial role\nwith me in maintaining the health of the hives. It\u2019s paramount to honor the\nbee\u2019s needs and ensure they have ample nutrition. Honey production is\nessential for the bees\u2019 survival during winter.\n\nBeekeepers Judi Harvest and Luca Polo \u00a9 Judi Harvest\n\nCould you discuss your concerns regarding ensuring bees have access to\nsufficient forage and how you consider their travel range?\u201d\n\nWhen I built the garden, planting 500 flowering plants and 30 little fruit\ntrees, there was no way to know if that was going to be enough for the bees.\nFlowers are their only food. They need five million flowers to make a pint of\nhoney and they forage from sunup to sundown. They may visit a thousand flowers\na day drawn to them by odor and color patterns. Bees pollinate flowers\nprimarily with sweet scents and they see them in the ultraviolet color\nspectrum, which humans do not see and are probably more beautiful with\npatterns that guide them toward the nectar and pollen. Who knows the exact\nnumber of plants they visit, but there are some statistics ... and they are\nspecific. The flowers need to be easily accessible, such as a sunflower, which\nis flat. Or a rose, which doesn\u2019t have multiple petals. They don\u2019t like to\nwaste time. They\u2019re not going to go in and dig. They love Magnolias because\nthey can zoom around the interior of the blossom and there is a lot of pollen.\nBut I was concerned, and I worried about whether they would have enough to\neat. I certainly didn\u2019t want them to die of starvation.\n\n> \u201cHoneybees navigate by the latitude and longitude of the sun and therefore\n> know which vaporetto and what time it arrives. This information is\n> communicated among the bees through the Waggle Dance \u2013their language is a\n> dance.\u201d\n\nHowever, it turns out that in Venice, many gardens are not obvious, because\npeople have created them inside their palazzos or behind walls. There\u2019s a book\nby Tudy Sammartini called The Secret Gardens of Venice, that shares some of\nthem. She has since passed, but she was famous for her research and\nphotographs of the secret gardens. However, my bees found their closest\nadditional foraging spot in the cemetery. It\u2019s quiet. There are floral plants\nthere and people regularly bring flowers. The most interesting thing is that\nthey take the Vaporetto to get there, which was an amazing discovery for me.\nOne day, I was riding on the vaporetto as always, outside. I don\u2019t like to be\ncrowded inside with lots of people and tourists and so on. So, I stay outside,\nright by the gate where the person that opens the vaporetto, lets people in\nand out from. We arrived at the cemetery, which is the first stop from the\nisland of Venice from the Fondamente Nove. Vaporetto 4.2 stops at the cemetery\nand then Murano. I\u2019m out there and I look up and I see some bees on the sign\nCIMITERO (Cemetery) and I\u2019m thinking, wow, those are mine. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re my\nbees. So I took a picture and the woman who was opening the vaporetto gate\nsaid, \u201cOh, Senora, don\u2019t worry. They don\u2019t do anything. They don\u2019t harm\nanyone.\u201d I said, \u201cI know, I\u2019m their mother.\u201d I get back on again and the\ncaptain of the vaporetto says to me, \u201cAnd when it rains, they ride inside with\nme.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s very funny.\u201d So then I think, \u201cWait, stay outside and\nwatch.\u201d And at the first stop, they don\u2019t get off the vaporetto- they\u2019re still\nclinging onto the ropes. The second stop is Serenella where I have the garden\nand keep the bees-and when we arrive, they fly out and fly home.\n\nThey don\u2019t swim. It\u2019s one of the few things honeybees don\u2019t do. They get water\nfrom nectar and they do drink water, especially in the summer, and they need\nit for the hive, but they don\u2019t really like water. They don\u2019t like rain. They\nnever go out if it rains. If it starts to rain while they\u2019re out, they\u2019ll seek\nsome kind of refuge, as in with the Vaporetto captain.\n\nBefore.\n\nAfter. \u00a9 Judi Harvest\n\nAt that point, Giorgio Giuman, the glass master I work with, happened to be\nstanding at the vaporetto stop. He is rarely out of the factory, but he had to\ngo somewhere, and he saw 10 or so bees take off. He says, \u201cGiudita, look!\u201d And\neverybody was amazed.\n\nAt that point, I realized that bees can\u2019t fly long distances over the water\nand that they may communicate the path to distant flowers which includes\ntaking public transportation. The German paleontologist, Karl von Fritsch\ndiscovered the Waggle Dance in 1943, which is the unique dance that honeybees\ndo for their sisters, the other worker bees, in the shape of figure eight to\ncommunicate direction, location, distance to foraging sites and new nest site\nlocations.\n\nBees don\u2019t have ears. Their communication process, or language, is dance. They\ncan communicate up to 40 million messages in one dance. The rhythmic, circling\ndance is performed inside the hive after one or many bees comes back from\nforaging. The different scents of the pollen on their furry little bodies also\nconvey information. Honeybees are furry, as opposed to a wasp, which is not,\nand are the enemies of honeybees. So they do this dance and while they\u2019re\ndancing and waggling, the scent comes off and they dance in the direction of\nthe latitude-longitude of the sun. At noon, around when I saw them, is when\nthe sun is hitting the flowers that they need in the cemetery at the right\nangle. They have to be very quick. They only live four weeks, so they have to\nget in and get out. They don\u2019t have time to waste. Their dance floor is\ngenerally the very entrance of the hive. I call it a dance floor. I\u2019m sure\nit\u2019s technically called something else. Out they go to whatever patch of\nflowers the scout bee has come to inform them of.\n\nThis goes on, sunup to sundown, three miles out, three miles back every day.\nThey don\u2019t forage only in their garden. I see them, they\u2019re hanging out there,\nbut they also pollinate elsewhere. In the mornings, like an airplane, they\u2019re\nup and out at sunrise. Up they go and out they go, thousands of trips a day\nper bee. And back in again with the pollen on their kneecaps. Sometimes the\npollen is so big they can\u2019t fit into the openings of the hive. They get\nenthusiastic, I know how that is. They fly with three times their body weight.\nBees have collected these pollen balls in their knee pockets, a little like\ncargo pants. Entering the hive, the pollen rarely falls off, if it does,\nanother bee comes out, picks it up, and brings it in. They work together. It\u2019s\nan amazing thing to see how they help each other.\n\n\u00a9Judi Harvest\n\nThis demonstrates remarkable complex and adaptive behavior. I can\u2019t help but\nwonder if the Waggle Dance really explains that they have to take public\ntransportation to the food source.\n\nI wrote and illustrated a book called \u201cThe Mysterious Traveling Honeybees of\nVenice.\u201d People thought I made it up. But now some people come up to me and\nsay, \u201cHey, I saw your bees going to Burano. I saw ... \u201d And on the larger\nboats, called Traghettos, sometimes they ride on the life preservers at the\ntop. The Traghettos go to Burano or Torcello. So, they have other places to\nhang out. When they travel on the Traghettos they usually position themselves\noutside, at the top, on the life preservers. So keep your eyes open when\nyou\u2019re in Venice.\n\nThe natural sunlight in the Honey Garden has a wonderful poetic quality\nfiltering through the foliage. One becomes vividly aware of the sun\u2019s\npositioning. Overall, I was struck by its graceful, serene beauty and how it\nevokes contemplation on the interconnectedness of life, provides revelations\nfor the senses, and instills hope. Thank you for the resilience you have\ncreated for an ecosystem under climate stress and for making a home for over\n40,000 bees.\n\nWhen I started the garden in a furnace waste yard, I assumed the weather would\ncooperate...it rained, it snowed, it flooded. We never gave up. After 6 boat\nloads of soil, 30 fruit trees, and 500 flowering aromatic plants, the bees and\nhives, there is fantastic honey and healthy and happy, flourishing bee\ncolonies. The sun is out and 12 years later we are enjoying its beauty. Beauty\nmatters and I believe art heals.\n\nTO VISIT THE MURANO HONEY GARDEN\n\nVisits to the Murano Honey Garden are by appointment only as it\u2019s inside the\nGiorgio Giuman Glass Factory on Sacca Serenella, Murano.
