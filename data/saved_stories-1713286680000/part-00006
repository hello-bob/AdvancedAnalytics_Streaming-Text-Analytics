However, we can say that if all your subscribers opted in, you should see a delivery rate of at least 97%. If you\u2019re seeing lower, feel free to get in touch with our support team.\n\n  * In a nutshell, adhering to GDPR means that you tell people what data you collect, how long you store it for, and why you store it. You have to provide this data upfront BEFORE you store it. That's why Maildroppa includes it clearly in a two-step form and sends a follow-up confirmation email.\n\nGDPR laws only apply to citizens in the EU, but it's generally best to notify\nall your subscribers of your policy as other countries have similar laws under\ndifferent acronyms.\n\n  * Yup, you're in the right place. Maildroppa wil always track delivery rate as it's required by Gmail, Outlook and others. On the optional tracking, we include two tracking pixels and redirect links in our emails to provide reporting. You can simply toggle those off in your settings.\n\nOur policy is to only store date that's necessary for a functioning service.\nNothing more, nothing less.\n\n  * We're based in Germany!
