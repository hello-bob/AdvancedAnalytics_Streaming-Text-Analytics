HTTP/2 support is one of the most requested and\ndesired improvements for the Heroku platform. HTTP/2 is significantly faster\nthan HTTP 1.1 by introducing features like multiplexing and header compression\nto reduce latency and therefore improve the end-user experience of Heroku\napps.\n\nSince 2023, we\u2019ve been working on a large platform modernization of our Common\nRuntime router. This project will allow us to start delivering more modern\nnetworking for Heroku. With the majority of that work now complete, we\u2019re\nexcited to focus more on the future and new features.\n\n## What Do You Get From HTTP/2?\n\nUpgrading to HTTP/2, the next-generation HTTP protocol, significantly improves\nweb app performance for our customers. Here's how:\n\n  * Faster loading times: HTTP/2 uses header compression and multiplexing to deliver content quicker and more efficiently. This improvement translates to faster page loads, especially for content-heavy applications with many images or videos.\n\n  * Enhanced responsiveness: HTTP/2 lets multiple requests travel simultaneously on a single connection, and stream prioritization ensures smoother communication and faster updates. HTTP/2 reduces latency and improves performance for real-time applications like chat or live collaborative tools.\n\n  * Improved user experience: Streamlined data transfer and reduced waiting times lead to a more enjoyable user experience. Users experience smoother scrolling, faster interactions with forms, and an overall improved sense of responsiveness across Heroku applications.\n\nHTTP/2 terminates at the Heroku router and we forward HTTP/1.1 from the router\nto your app. This method is great because you get most of the benefits of\nHTTP/2 without having to make any changes to your app or code.\n\nAlong with this beta, we\u2019ll continue to research solutions to provide HTTP/2\nend-to-end (all the way to the dyno) and enable features like Server Push and\ngRPC use cases with Heroku apps. Those capabilities aren\u2019t included in this\nrelease.\n\nFor more information about HTTP/2, you can refer to the official HTTP/2 RFC\n(RFC 9113).\n\n## How to Turn On HTTP/2 For Your Application\n\nA valid TLS certificate is required for HTTP/2. We recommend using Heroku\nAutomated Certificate Management.\n\n### Common Runtime Applications\n\nFor Common Runtime apps, if you\u2019re in the Routing 2.0 Public Beta, HTTP/2 is\non by default. If you\u2019re not in the beta, you can enable it with this command:\n\n    \n    \n    $ heroku labs:enable http-routing-2-dot-0 -a <app name>\n\nAfter enabling the new router for your app, it can handle HTTP/2 traffic. In\nthe Common Runtime, we support HTTP/2 on custom domains, but not on the built-\nin <app-name-cff7f1443a49>.herokuapp.com domain.\n\nTo opt out of HTTP/2, simply disable the new router on your application.\nPrivate Spaces and Shield Spaces Applications\n\n### Private and Shield Spaces Applications\n\nFor Private and Shield Spaces apps, you can enable HTTP/2 for an app with a\nHeroku Labs flag:\n\n    \n    \n    $ heroku labs:enable spaces-http2 -a <app name>\n\nIn Private Spaces, we support HTTP/2 on both custom domains and the built-in\ndefault app domain.\n\nTo disable HTTP/2, simply disable the Heroku labs spaces-http2 flag on your\napp.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019re excited to finally bring HTTP/2 to the Heroku platform to see how it\nimproves our customers' apps and their users\u2019 experience.\n\nHTTP/2 is currently in public beta. When our new router becomes the default on\nCommon Runtime, the feature will become generally available for all Heroku\ncustomers.\n\nWe want to express our sincere appreciation for the feedback received on the\nHeroku Public roadmap request that led to this change. Your insights were\ninstrumental in shaping this first release of features on our next-generation\nrouter. We'll continue monitoring the public roadmap and your feedback as we\nexplore future networking and routing enhancements, especially our continued\nresearch on expanding HTTP/2 functionality to dynos and exploring HTTP/3.\n\nOriginally published: May 07, 2024\n\nrouting dynos networking http2\n\n  * Tweet\n  * Share\n  * Share\n\n######\n\nRelated posts\n\n  * Expanded Memory and Compute with Heroku's New Larger Dynos\n  * Global Expansion for Heroku Private Spaces: Canada, India, Singapore, and the United Kingdom\n  * Heroku Adds Third Availability Zone for Private Spaces\n  * The Adventures of Rendezvous in Heroku\u2019s New Architecture\n  * Faster Dynos For All\n\n###### More from the author\n\n##### Ethan Limchayseng\n\nHeroku Staff\n\n  * Expanded Memory and Compute with Heroku's New Larger Dynos\n  * Global Expansion for Heroku Private Spaces: Canada, India, Singapore, and the United Kingdom\n  * Heroku Adds Third Availability Zone for Private Spaces\n\nBrowse the archives for news or all blogs Subscribe to the RSS feed for news\nor all blogs.\n\n### Subscribe to our monthly newsletter\n\n  * RSS\n\n    * Heroku Blog\n    * Heroku News Blog\n    * Heroku Engineering Blog\n    * Dev Center Articles\n    * Dev Center Changelog\n    * Heroku Status\n\n  * Twitter\n\n    * Heroku\n    * Dev Center Articles\n    * Dev Center Changelog\n    * Heroku Status\n\n  * GitHub\n  * LinkedIn\n\nHeroku is a company\n\n  * heroku.com\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy\n  * Cookies\n  * Cookie Preferences\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * \u00a9 2024 Salesforce.com\n\nWe use cookies on our website to improve website performance, to analyze\nwebsite usage and to tailor content and offers to your interests.
