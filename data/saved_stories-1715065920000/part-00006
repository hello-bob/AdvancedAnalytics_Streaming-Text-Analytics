The incident is serious.\n\nSave to Pocket listen Print view\n\nThe use of Webex by the German Armed Forces is now likely to once again\nconcern the military counterintelligence service MAD.\n\n(Bild: dpa, Oliver Berg/dpa)\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 10:43 am CEST\n\n3 min. read\n\nBy\n\n  * Nico Ernst\n\nAnzeige\n\nThis article was originally published in German and has been automatically\ntranslated.\n\nFor months, the dates, participants and topics of Bundeswehr conferences\nplanned via the Cisco Webex system were openly available on the internet. This\nwas reported by Zeit Online, which investigated the case together with the\nNetzbegr\u00fcnung association.\n\nAnzeige\n\nAs a spokesperson for the cyber and information space force confirmed on\nSaturday when asked by Deutsche Pressagentur, there had been a \"vulnerability\"\nduring the week, but this had been rectified within 24 hours. Previously,\nmetadata such as times and participants had been accessible via the Webex\ncommunication platform. However, it was not possible to dial in or access\nconfidential content.\n\nAlthough this reads quite harmless in the agency report, it is not, according\nto Die Zeit. The gap is said to have existed for months, and the meetings were\nnumbered consecutively - the corresponding URLs could apparently be guessed.\nOver 6000 appointments were available. In addition, the topics of a conference\nalone represented confidential information on the troops, which was publicly\naccessible and therefore a perfect target for spies.\n\n### Topics and meeting rooms openly online\n\nAccording to Zeit, there was a meeting on 25 April with the subject \"Review\nTaurus milestone plan and finalization\" as well as other conferences that were\nalso classified as \"Classified information - for official use only\" (VS-NfD).\nAccording to Federal Minister of Defense Oscar in March 2023, this is also\npermitted for Webex discussions. Higher classifications such as \"Secret\" may\nnot be used via Webex.\n\nThe appointments could be tracked until the beginning of November 2023. The\nfixed meeting rooms of some officers were also visible, such as that of the\nAir Force Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz. He was one of the\nparticipants in the Webex conversation leaked by Russian actors in March on\nthe possible deployment of the Taurus cruise missile in Ukraine. As\nNetzbegr\u00fcnung explains, identifiers such as first name.surname could also\npotentially be used to create \"complete or almost complete email data sets\".\nWhat's more, Die Zeit was also able to enter Gerhartz's meeting room,\naccording to its own account.\n\nThis apparently careless use of Webex by the Bundeswehr also raises new\nquestions, which those responsible wanted to clear up quickly after the Taurus\nleak. At the time, Pistorius emphasized that the troops were using a \"Webex\nfor Bundeswehr\" that was operated on their own systems. However, if these\ncomputers, which are operated on their own networks, spit out publicly\naccessible websites, none of this is of any use.\n\nAnzeige\n\n(nie)\n\nAnzeige\n\nAnzeige\n\n  * Modulare Rechenzentren: effizient, nachhaltig, skalierbar\n  * So haben Admins weniger Stress\n  * Flash-Speicher: Fr\u00fchwarnsystem f\u00fcr Cyberangriffe\n  * Cyberbedrohungen 2024: Trends in der Cyber-Security\n  * Virtueller Rundgang durch die Stadt von morgen\n  * Website erstellen lassen: Lohnt sich die Investition?\n  * Sind APIs das neue Einfallstor f\u00fcr Angreifer?\n  * Themenspecial: Secure IT f\u00fcr Unternehmen\n  * Themenspecial: Moderne IT-Infrastruktur\n  * Mehr Kunden f\u00fcr Ihren Online-Shop gewinnen\n\nShare this article\n\nKurzlink: https://heise.de/-9708336\n\n## Spiele\n\nAlle Spiele im \u00dcberblick\n\n  * TGIQF\n  * Solit\u00e4r\n  * Sudoku\n  * Mahjong\n  * eXchange\n  * Bubbles\n  * SNAKE\n  * SudoKen\n  * Schach\n  * Fibonacci\n  * Power Of 2\n  * Street\n  * Cuboro Riddles\n  * Gumblast\n  * Doppel\n  * Rushtower\n  * Wortblitz\n  * Wimmelbild\n  * Skiracer\n  * Sudoku leicht\n  * Sudoku schwer\n  * Sudoku sehr schwer\n\nAnzeige\n\nAnzeige\n\nnach oben\n\nAlle Angebote\n\nNewsletter heise-Bot Push Push-Nachrichten\n\n  * Datenschutz\n  * Cookies & Tracking\n  * Impressum\n  * Kontakt\n  * Barriere melden\n  * Mediadaten\n  * Vertr\u00e4ge k\u00fcndigen\n  * 4584871\n\n  * Content Management by InterRed\n  * Hosted by Plus.line\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Heise Medien\n\n### 1 Jahr nur 1,90 \u20ac pro Woche\n\nJetzt testen\n\n#### Das digitale Abo f\u00fcr IT und Technik.\n\nNur bis zum 31.
