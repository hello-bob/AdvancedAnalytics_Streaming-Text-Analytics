For nearly a year, she had complained about the\nrestrictions of the psychiatric unit, but her only plan for her release was to\nremain invisible. She spent two nights in a field she called Hoboville, where\nhomeless people slept, and then began wandering around Concord, avoiding the\nmain streets. Wary of spies, she cut through the underbrush behind buildings,\nwalked through gullies beside the roads, and, when she needed to rest, huddled\nin the bushes. Her life was saved along the way, she later wrote, by two\nwarblers and an owl.\n\nA tall, athletic fifty-one-year-old with blue eyes and a bachelor\u2019s degree in\nart history from the University of New Hampshire, Linda had been admitted to\nthe hospital in late October, 2006, after having been found incompetent to\nstand trial for a series of offenses. She spent most of her eleven months\nthere reading, writing, and crocheting. She refused all psychiatric\nmedication, because she believed her diagnosis (bipolar disorder with\npsychosis) was a mistake. Each time she met a new psychiatrist, she declared\nher lack of respect for the profession. Only when conversations moved away\nfrom her mental illness, a term she generally placed in quotation marks, was\nshe cheerful and engaged. Her medical records consistently note the same\ntraits: \u201cextremely bright,\u201d \u201cvery pleasant,\u201d \u201cdenies completely that she has\nan illness.\u201d In the weeks leading up to her discharge, her doctors urged her\nto make arrangements for housing and follow-up care, but Linda refused,\nsaying, \u201cGod will provide.\u201d\n\nDuring a rainstorm on her fourth day out of the hospital, Linda broke into a\nvacant farmhouse for sale on Mountain Road, a scenic residential street. The\nthree-story home overlooked a brook and an apple orchard, and a few rooms were\nstill sparsely furnished. Linda intended to stay only a few nights, but she\nbegan to worry that her dirty clothes would attract attention if she walked\nback to town. \u201cI look terrible . . . like a vagrant,\u201d she wrote in a black\nleather pocket notebook that the previous tenants had left behind. Linda had\nled a nomadic existence ever since she had abandoned her sleeping thirteen-\nyear-old daughter, in 1999, leaving a note saying that she was going to meet\nthe governor. She drifted between homeless shelters, hospitals, and jail. She\nwrote in the journal that she wasn\u2019t ready to \u201cmake my presence known\u2014and just\nstart the whole mess again\u2014to prove what\u2014that I\u2019m all right? Have done that\ntoo many times.\u201d Two days after breaking into the house, she decided to make\nthe place her temporary home. She would subsist on apples while \u201cawaiting\nfurther instructions\u201d from God.\n\nLinda settled into a routine. In the morning, when the sun poured through the\nliving-room window, warming the end of the couch, she read college textbooks\nshe found in the attic. The former tenant appeared to have dropped out of\nschool in 1969 (\u201cbut his creative writing is very good!\u201d she noted), and she\nbegan embarking on the education he had abandoned. She began with Joseph\nConrad and moved on to biology (\u201cchloroplasts, lysosomes, mitochondria + cell\ndivision!\u201d) and \u201cGreat Issues in Western Civilization.\u201d When she had enough\nenergy, she did her \u201cchores.\u201d She combed her graying brown hair\u2014first with a\nsmall rake, and, when that proved too cumbersome, with a fork\u2014and tidied the\nhouse, in case potential buyers came for a viewing. There was no electricity\nor water, but, after dusk, she rinsed her underwear in the brook, collected\nwater with a vase, and picked apples.\n\nAfter the first week, she estimated that she had lost ten pounds. When she\nlooked in the mirror, she was startled by how drawn her face had become. Yet\nafter enduring so many irritations in her hospital unit\u2014patients who wouldn\u2019t\nstop talking, or who touched her, or sat in her favorite chair, or made noise\nin the middle of the night\u2014she didn\u2019t mind having time alone. From her\nwindows, she enjoyed watching purple finches, tufted titmice, chickadees, and\n\u201cMr. and Mrs. Cardinal.\u201d She wished she had binoculars. A neighbor came over\nto mow the lawn and pull the weeds. \u201cHe has no idea I\u2019m here!\u201d Linda wrote, as\nshe watched him from an upstairs window.\n\nThe threat that Linda was hiding from was a shifty one\u2014she alluded to\nconspiracies involving her older sister, the government, and Satan\u2019s\nworkers\u2014but she also wondered if anyone was even looking for her. She kept\nretracing the series of events that had led her to this house. She knew it\ndidn\u2019t \u201cmake sense to be barely existing\u201d\u2014she got light-headed just walking up\nthe stairs\u2014but she felt that the situation must have been willed by the Lord.\nBy the end of October, she had a stash of three hundred apples. She worried\nabout the coming winter as she watched trees lose their leaves, milkweed seeds\nblow in the wind \u201clike it\u2019s snowing,\u201d and geese migrate south. Still, she\ncould find \u201cno signs or clues that I should be doing anything different.\u201d\n\nThroughout Linda\u2019s stay at New Hampshire Hospital, her doctors routinely noted\nthat she lacked \u201cinsight,\u201d a term that has a troubled legacy in psychiatry.\nStudies have shown that nearly half of people given a diagnosis of psychotic\nillness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, say that they are not\nmentally ill\u2014naturally, they also tend to resist treatment. The psychiatrist\nAubrey Lewis defined insight in 1934 in the British Journal of Medical\nPsychology as the \u201ccorrect attitude to a morbid change in oneself.\u201d But the\ndefinition was so ambiguous that his paper was ignored for over fifty years.\nPsychiatrists were reluctant to move away from objective, observable phenomena\nand to examine the private ways that people make sense of the experience of\nlosing their minds. Today, insight is assessed every time a patient enters a\npsychiatric hospital, through the Mental Status Examination, but this form of\nawareness is still poorly understood. Patients are considered insightful when\nthey can reinterpret unusual occurrences\u2014growing angel\u2019s wings, feeling as if\ntheir organs have been removed, decoding political messages in street signs\u2014as\npsychiatric symptoms. In the absence of any clear neurological marker of\npsychosis, the field revolves around a paradox: an early sign of sanity is the\nability to recognize that you\u2019ve been insane. (A \u201ccorrect attitude,\u201d for most\nWestern psychiatrists, would exclude interpretations featuring spirits,\ndemons, or karmic disharmony.)\n\nGetting patients to acknowledge their own disorders also has become an ethical\nimperative. Implicit in the doctrine of informed consent is the notion that\nbefore agreeing to take medication patients should be aware of the nature and\ncourse of their own illnesses. In balancing rights against needs, though,\npsychiatry is stuck in a kind of moral impasse. It is the only field in which\nrefusal of treatment is commonly viewed as a manifestation of illness rather\nthan as an authentic wish. According to Linda\u2019s treatment review, her most\nperplexing behavior was her \u201ccontinuing denial of the legitimacy of her\n\u2018patienthood.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen psychoanalytic theories were dominant, patients who claimed they were\nsane were thought to be protecting themselves from a truth too shattering to\nbear. In more recent years, the problem has been reframed as a cognitive\ndeficit intrinsic to the disease. \u201cIt has nothing to do with willfulness\u2014you\njust don\u2019t have the capacity to know,\u201d Xavier Amador, an adjunct professor of\npsychology at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College, said. Amador is the\nauthor of the most widely used test for measuring insight, the Scale to Assess\nUnawareness of Mental Disorder, which asks patients why they think their\njudgments or perceptions have changed. Although researchers haven\u2019t uncovered\ndistinct neurological anomalies linked to lack of insight, Amador and other\nscholars have adopted the term \u201canosognosia,\u201d which more typically describes\npatients with brain damage who lose the use of limbs or senses yet cannot\nacknowledge the existence of their new disabilities. Those who go blind\nbecause of lesions in their visual cortex, for instance, insist that they can\nstill see, and tell fanciful stories to explain why they are walking into\nfurniture.\n\nAnosognosia was introduced as a synonym for \u201cpoor insight\u201d in the most recent\nedition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, but the\nconcept remains slippery, since the phenomenon it describes is essentially\nsocial: the extent to which a patient agrees with her doctor\u2019s interpretation.\nFor Linda, the validity of her diagnosis was the subtext of nearly all her\nencounters with her psychiatrists, whose attempts to teach her that parts of\nher personality could be \u201cconstrued as a mental illness,\u201d as she described it,\nonly alienated her. She wrote to a friend that she was using her hospital stay\nas an opportunity \u201cmerely to prove that I don\u2019t have a mental illness (and\nnever did).\u201d\n\n\u201cSee? It never hurts to ask.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nLinda had always been fond of farmhouses. She grew up on Long Island and took\npride in her family\u2019s sprawling vegetable garden. \u201cMy childhood was a good\none, with loving and supportive parents who believed in doing things as a\nfamily,\u201d she wrote in an application to an assisted-housing program. She had a\nlarge circle of friends and excelled in school with little effort. \u201cShe was\nbubbly and exuded competence,\u201d an old friend, Holliday Kane Rayfield, who is\nnow a psychiatrist, said. Linda\u2019s family thought she would become a professor,\nbut she never settled on a professional career. Kathleen White, her closest\nfriend from college, said that her \u201cdream was to find a guy with a sense of\nhumor, have kids, and live on a farm.\u201d\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nFlipping the Script on Trans Medical Encounters\n\nLinda got married in 1985, and gave birth to her daughter, Caitlin, five\nmonths later. But she complained about her husband\u2019s temper, and after her\nbrief marriage ended she struggled to support Caitlin on her own. She worked\nlong hours at a Chinese restaurant in Rochester, New Hampshire, and on her\ndays off she and Caitlin visited museums in Boston or went on camping trips or\ntook aimless drives through the state. Caitlin, now a twenty-five-year-old\nphoto technician at Walmart, told me, \u201cWe were each other\u2019s world.\u201d It wasn\u2019t\nuntil her mother quit her waitressing job in order to evade the \u201cChinese\nMafia\u201d that Caitlin, who was in seventh grade, began to doubt her mother\u2019s\njudgment. In 1999, in a purple Dodge Dart, the two fled the state, heading\ntoward Canada. Caitlin, too, was terrified of being captured. \u201cI figured I was\ncollateral damage,\u201d she said. Linda called friends on the way but lied about\nher location, because she suspected that she was talking to spies. While her\nmother used pay phones at gas stations, Caitlin waited in the car. \u201cAt some\npoint, I just thought to myself, I know better than this,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen they returned, a little more than a week later, after Linda\u2019s fears had\nsubsided, Linda\u2019s sister, Joan Bishop, and their parents tried unsuccessfully\nto persuade Linda to see a doctor. Soon, she disappeared again. She went to\nConcord, the state capital, to inform authorities that the government was\nbehind John F. Kennedy, Jr.,\u2019s plane crash, and then wandered alone through\nthe state for several days, feeling as if she had \u201cingested some sort of\npoison or drug without knowing it.\u201d Caitlin moved in with her paternal\ngrandmother and stayed there even when Linda came home. Linda finally checked\ninto a hospital in Dover, New Hampshire, where she was given a diagnosis of\nschizoaffective disorder, and began taking Zyprexa, an antipsychotic, and\nlithium, a mood stabilizer. (Her diagnosis shifted between bipolar and\nschizoaffective\u2014a mixture of schizophrenia and a mood disorder\u2014depending on\nthe doctor.) Psychotic disorders typically begin in early adulthood, but it is\nnot uncommon for them to develop later in life, particularly after periods of\nstress or isolation. Linda sobbed for the first few days, and talked about how\nbetrayed she felt by those who were scheming against her. By the fourth day,\nthough, her psychiatrist wrote, \u201cShe now has insight into the fact that these\nare paranoid delusions, and a part of her is able to say that maybe some of\nthese things didn\u2019t happen, perhaps some of the people she felt were plotting\nagainst her really weren\u2019t.\u201d Ten days later, she was released.\n\nIt was the beginning of a persistent and common cycle. With each\nhospitalization, Linda was educated about her illness and the need for\nmedication. This is the standard approach for increasing insight, but it does\nnot account for the fact that people\u2019s beliefs, even those which are wildly\nfalse, shape their identities. If a person goes from being a political martyr\nto a mental patient in just a few days\u2014the sign of a successful hospital stay,\nby most standards\u2014her life may begin to feel banal and useless. Insight is\ncorrelated with fewer hospital readmissions, better performance at work, and\nmore social contacts, but it is also linked with lower self-esteem and\ndepression. People recovering from psychotic episodes rarely receive extensive\ntalk therapy, because insurance companies place strict limits on the number of\nsessions allowed and because for years psychiatrists have assumed that\npsychotic patients are unable to reflect meaningfully on their lives. (Eugen\nBleuler, the psychiatrist who coined the term \u201cschizophrenia,\u201d said that after\nyears of talking to his patients he found them stranger than the birds in his\ngarden.)\n\nWith medication as her only form of treatment, Linda was unable to modify her\nself-image to accommodate the facts of her illness. When psychotic, she saw\nherself as the heroine in a tale of terrible injustice, a role that gave her\nconfidence and purpose. After the World Trade Center attacks, in 2001, she\nmoved to New York City, because she felt she had been called to offer her\nhelp. A December, 2001, article in the New York Post, \u201cHomeless \u2018Angel\u2019 a\nBlessing at Ground Zero,\u201d described how Linda patrolled the perimeter of the\nsite, waving an American flag, greeting visitors, and giving impromptu tours.\n\u201cAngels come to earth in disguises\u2014some come as paupers,\u201d a construction\nworker was quoted as saying. A man identified as a 9/11 victim said that \u201cGod\nrested on her shoulder.\u201d Linda thanked workers at the site for their efforts\nand talked to tourists about what they were witnessing. \u201cI try to help people\nunderstand the enormity,\u201d she told the reporter. She dubbed herself the head\nof Hell\u2019s Chamber of Commerce.\n\nFor the next few years, Linda wandered: she lived on the streets, in homeless\nshelters, and in her sister\u2019s house, on the condition that she take\nmedication. Joan, who works as the director of education for the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court, has the same warm, jovial manner as her sister, and the two\nspent much of their free time together, though Linda\u2019s goal was to find her\nown home. In 2003, she entered a supported-housing program in Manchester, New\nHampshire, and told her caseworker that she wanted to \u201clive like an adult\nagain.\u201d She was upset that her illness had alienated her daughter and friends.\nJoan told me that \u201cLinda would talk analytically about how it had felt to be\ndelusional. It wasn\u2019t a matter of imagining. It wasn\u2019t as if she felt she was\nbeing chased by government agents. In her mind, they were as real as I am\nright now.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Caitlin, by then a senior in high school, decided to\nmove back in with her mother for the first time in five years. Their new\napartment, in Rochester, New Hampshire, became the preferred hangout spot for\nher friends. \u201cShe was the cool mom,\u201d Jessica Jamriska, a close friend of\nCaitlin\u2019s, said. \u201cShe had stopped talking about the government, except maybe\nif there was an election. And the only reason she quoted the Bible is if we\nwere having intellectual debates about, you know, whether it\u2019s a book of\nmorals or not.\u201d\n\nLinda enjoyed cooking large meals for Caitlin\u2019s friends, but over time the\nstories she told at the dinner table became harder to follow. \u201cAt first, we\njust thought, O.K., it\u2019s normal to have some fantasies and dreams,\u201d Jessica\nsaid. \u201cShe would talk a lot about some dude she loved who was going to make\neverything all right, and we weren\u2019t even sure he existed.\u201d\n\nCaitlin and Joan urged Linda to take her medication, but she said that she\nfelt perfectly fine and complained that the drugs made her lethargic and\ncaused her to gain weight. (Linda\u2019s parents, who had encouraged her to follow\nher doctors\u2019 advice, had died, both of them from cancer, in 2003 and 2004.)\nCaitlin and two of her friends finally decided to make an audiotape of Linda\nranting. \u201cWe wanted to have proof, to say, look, this is objectively crazy,\nand someone needs to help her,\u201d Caitlin said. They recorded her talking about\nhow children should be armed with AK-47s, and called the police, but Caitlin\nsaid that their complaint was never taken seriously. In February, 2005,\nLinda\u2019s car flipped on its side on Rochester\u2019s main street. When the police\narrived, they smelled alcohol on her breath. She said that she had purposely\ncaused the accident, to prove \u201cthat police officers are \u2018illegal.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAlthough it was a relatively minor offense (her alcohol level was below the\nlegal threshold), Linda refused to pay the five-hundred-dollar bail, so she\nwas sent to the Strafford County House of Corrections, in March. (Nationally,\na quarter of jail inmates meet the criteria for a psychotic disorder.) After\nher first arrest, Linda threw a cup of urine at a corrections officer and\nstruck a man with a broomstick. Joan wrote to the police department\u2019s\nprosecuting attorney, explaining that before her illness Linda had never been\n\u201cviolent or aggressive towards anyone or anything.\u201d She said that the family\nhadn\u2019t been able to get Linda into psychiatric treatment, and asked the\nattorney to help.\n\nJoan\u2019s request led to competency evaluations, and, as Linda waited in jail for\nthe results, she moved even farther away from the life she had led before her\nillness. She considered herself a \u201cpeople person\u201d\u2014she made Christmas cards for\nother inmates out of lunch bags and magazine ads, sealed with grape jelly\u2014but\nshe found herself isolated from all the people with whom she had once been\nclose. She wrote Caitlin long letters with tips about what cosmetics to wear,\nhow to get a job, shop for bargains, lose weight, make apple pie, and avoid\nthe presence of people who belong in Hell, but Caitlin stopped responding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to count it as both a wave and a particle for tax purposes.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nAfter a year and a half in jail, Linda was deemed incompetent to stand trial\nand was transferred to New Hampshire Hospital for a commitment term of up to\nthree years. She was humiliated by the idea of anyone evaluating her\ncompetence and wrote to Caitlin, \u201cMy constitutional rights have been ignored,\ntrampled on and violated due to your Aunt Joan.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire Hospital was established, in 1842, as a kind of utopian\ncommunity, a reprieve from the disorder of the outside world. The hospital\u2019s\nearly leaders tried to help patients regain their common sense\u2014in the first\nyear, more than a quarter of admitted patients suffered from an\n\u201coverindulgence in religious thoughts,\u201d with several claiming to be\nprophets\u2014by immersing them in a model society. The hospital was situated on a\nhundred and seventeen acres, and patients lived in a stately, red-brick\nColonial building with a steeple and a tiered white porch, surrounded by\ntrees. They farmed, gardened, and cooked together; there was a golf course, an\norchestra, a monthly newspaper, dances, and boating on the hospital\u2019s pond. In\n1866, the hospital\u2019s superintendent described psychosis as a \u201cwaking dream,\nwhich, if not broken in upon, works mischief to the brain,\u201d and wrote that the\ngoal of treatment was to \u201cinterfere with this world of self\u2014scatter its\ncreations and fancies and people it with objects and thoughts foreign to its\nown.\u201d\n\nAs the patient population expanded, though, the hospital couldn\u2019t maintain its\nearly idealism. Psychiatrists no longer had time for the benevolent form of\ncare known as \u201cmoral treatment.\u201d As of 1936, the hospital had sterilized a\nhundred and fifty-five patients, and later it began experimenting with\nnewfangled remedies, like electroconvulsive therapy and insulin-induced comas;\nthe shock of such procedures, it was thought, might clear patients\u2019 minds. By\nthe nineteen-fifties, the hospital\u2019s population had swelled to twenty-seven\nhundred patients, and doctors were less concerned with creating a sense of\ncommunity than with maintaining security. Patients spent so many years in the\nhospital that they no longer knew how to leave it. (The institution has two\ngraveyards for people who died in its care.) The hospital\u2019s crowded wards\nresembled those studied in Erving Goffman\u2019s 1961 book, \u201cAsylums,\u201d which showed\nhow, through years of institutional life, people lost their identities and\nlearned to be perfect mental patients\u2014dull, unmotivated, and helpless.\n\nThe idea that mental illnesses were exacerbated, even caused, by the measures\ndesigned to treat them was elaborated by many scholars throughout the sixties.\nThomas Szasz, a psychiatrist and prolific author, described mental illness as\na \u201cmyth,\u201d a \u201cmetaphor.\u201d The psychiatrist R. D. Laing called it a \u201cperfectly\nrational adjustment to an insane world.\u201d In 1963, President Kennedy (whose\nsister Rosemary had received a lobotomy which left her barely able to speak)\npassed the Community Mental Health Centers Act, which called for psychiatric\nasylums to be replaced by a more humane network of behavioral-health centers\nand halfway homes. His \u201cbold new approach,\u201d as he called it, was plausible\nbecause of the recent development of antipsychotic drugs, which seemed to\npromise a quick cure. In the years that followed, civil-rights lawyers and\nactivists won a series of court cases that made it increasingly difficult for\npatients to be treated without their consent. In 1975, the Supreme Court ruled\nthat the state may not \u201cfence in the harmless mentally ill.\u201d Four years later,\nin Rogers v. Okin, a federal district court decided that involuntary\nmedication was unconstitutional, a form of \u201cmind control.\u201d The court\nmaintained that \u201cthe right to produce a thought\u2014or refuse to do so\u2014is as\nimportant as the right protected in Roe v. Wade to give birth or abort.\u201d\n\nDeinstitutionalization was a nationwide social experiment that did not go as\nplanned. Overgrown hospitals were shut down or emptied, but many fewer\ncommunity centers were opened than had been proposed. Resources steadily\ndeclined; in just the past three years, $2.2 billion has been cut from state\nmental-health budgets. \u201cWishing that mental illness would not exist has led\nour policymakers to shape a health-care system as if it did not exist,\u201d Paul\nAppelbaum said in his 2002 inaugural address as president of the American\nPsychiatric Association. Today, there are three times as many mentally ill\npeople in jails as in hospitals. Others end up on the streets. A paper in the\nAmerican Journal of Psychiatry, which examined the records of patients in San\nDiego\u2019s public mental-health system, found that one in five individuals with a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia is homeless in a given year.\n\nNew Hampshire Hospital, which now has only a hundred and fifty-eight beds,\nadmits people who have been sent from jail or who pose a danger to themselves\nor others. Often, people arrive at the emergency room, with concerned\nrelatives and friends, but they are turned away, because they are not an\nimminent threat. \u201cClinically, it\u2019s a shame,\u201d Alexander de Nesnera, the\nhospital\u2019s associate medical director, told me. \u201cThese are people who may be\nmaking choices they would never have made when they were healthy. But then\nthere\u2019s the civil-libertarian argument: Who are we to say that they don\u2019t have\nthe right to change their opinions?\u201d\n\nFreedom often ends up looking a lot like abandonment. Tanya Marie Luhrmann, a\nStanford anthropologist, told me that \u201cthere is something deeply American\nabout the force of our insistence that you should be able to ride it out on\nyour own.\u201d Luhrmann has followed mentally ill women in Chicago through what is\nknown as the \u201cinstitutional circuit\u201d\u2014the shelters, halfway homes, emergency\nrooms, and jails that have taken the place of mental asylums. Many of the\nwomen refused assisted housing, because to gain eligibility they had to\nidentify themselves as mentally ill. They would not \u201cformulate the sentence\nthat psychiatrists call \u2018insight,\u2019 \u201d Luhrmann said. \u201c \u2018I have a mental\nillness, these are my symptoms, and I know they are not real\u2019\u2014the whole\nbiomedical model. To ask for this kind of help is to be aware that you cannot\ntrust what you know.\u201d\n\nLinda readily acknowledged that her life had gone awry, but she insisted that\nher diminished circumstances had nothing to do with being \u201ccrazy.\u201d After\nreading a booklet on domestic violence, she concluded that her sister was\ntrying to abuse her by convincing others that she was ill and stealing her\ninheritance. \u201cThis will make a great book\u2014a N.Y. Times best seller,\u201d she wrote\nto a friend from the hospital.\n\nThree months into Linda\u2019s stay, the hospital filed a petition to make her\nsister, Joan, her legal guardian, with the authority to force her to take\nmedication. The hospital had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014the same\nthreshold used in criminal trials\u2014that Linda was incapable of making her own\ndecisions. At the hearing, Linda told the judge that her only problem was that\nshe was \u201cpermanently pissed off.\u201d \u201cI have a huge amount of medical knowledge,\u201d\nshe said. She pointed out that she took daily vitamins, wore anti-embolism\nstockings, had recently agreed to a mammogram, passed a first-aid course when\nshe was sixteen, and had an uncle who was a podiatrist. To the charge that she\nwas manic, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve always been like this. Okay? I\u2019m a waitress, I have\na lot of energy.\u201d The judge found that the evidence of Linda\u2019s incapacity\u2014her\nrefusal to accept why she was a patient\u2014did not meet the burden of proof.\nLinda had become a person that both her sister and her daughter hardly\nrecognized, but the court cannot deprive an individual of her legal rights\njust because her personality has changed. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t screaming, she wasn\u2019t\ntalking to the ceiling,\u201d Joan said.\n\nAfter the guardianship hearing, which Linda\u2019s psychiatrists viewed as their\none chance to medicate her, they began talking about her release, though\nhospital staff continued to express concern about Linda\u2019s belief in \u201cthe\n\u2018plot.\u2019 \u201d The psychiatrist who gave a second opinion on her discharge\npredicted that Linda would \u201cprobably get into further altercations with the\npolice\u201d and end up back at the hospital; then there would be more evidence to\napply again for a legal guardian. A third of patients discharged from New\nHampshire Hospital are readmitted. \u201cHer pattern,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis to attract\nattention to the police before situations become severely dangerous.\u201d He\nseemed to feel that only law-enforcement officials had the power to lead her\nto treatment.\n\nLinda had spent time away from the hospital on her daily \u201ccommunity\npasses\u201d\u2014she usually sat in a square in Concord, crocheting and people-\nwatching\u2014but she always returned before dinner was served. She was an active\nparticipant in support groups called Inner Strength, Loss & Recovery, and\nLifestyle Choices, but she avoided meetings that had a therapy component.\nAccording to worksheets she filled out at one group, \u201cfreedom\u201d was her only\nlong-term goal. Her short-term goals included \u201cget clothes,\u201d \u201cdepart from\nevil,\u201d \u201cput pressure on the guilty,\u201d and \u201claugh more.\u201d\n\nA hospital assistant who checked on patients every fifteen minutes to see \u201cif\nthey\u2019re breathing\u201d developed a friendship with Linda and encouraged her to\nthink seriously about what she would do after her discharge. But Linda cut off\ntheir conversations. \u201cI remember her walking down the hall and she turned\naround and she said, \u2018You\u2019re putting your values on my life,\u2019 \u201d the assistant\nlater explained. \u201cThat was my moment. That was, like, I have to back off.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you guys need a wacky, fun-loving jokester for your crew? I can make silly\nsounds.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nLinda\u2019s only plan for supporting herself was to sell some mittens and doilies\nshe had crocheted. Although she had complained of the indignity of being\nhomeless, she didn\u2019t authorize the hospital to share her records with a free\ntransitional-housing service, because when she reviewed the paperwork she saw\nher diagnosis. \u201cI refuse to sign anything that says I am mentally ill,\u201d she\ntold her social worker. Instead, she left the hospital with only pocket\nchange, no access to a bank account, and not a single person aware of where\nshe was going.\n\nBecause of patient-privacy laws, Linda\u2019s doctors never informed Joan or\nCaitlin that she had been released, and they could not tell them about her\ncondition during her hospitalization, either. Joan sent money and dropped off\nclothes, but Linda would not see her, and Joan began to feel as though she\nwere only getting in the way. In 2006, she joined the National Alliance of\nMental Illness, an organization with twelve hundred chapters created by family\nmembers (known as \u201cNAMI mommies\u201d) who felt excluded from the medical decisions\nmade by their loved ones. When the organization was founded, in 1979,\npsychosis was seen as a reaction to a dysfunctional family. According to a\nprominent theory of the time, the root of schizophrenia was a\n\u201cschizophrenogenic mother,\u201d incapable of communicating her love.\n\nWith the rise of brain-imaging scans, which draw links between disturbed\nbehavior and structures in the brain, this line of argument has fallen out of\nfavor. Many psychiatrists and activists argue that current treatment laws are\nbased on disproven theories of mental illness, and patients are given too much\nfreedom to decide what is in their own best interests. The psychiatrist Edwin\nFuller Torrey, whose sister had schizophrenia, and who was an early adviser to\nNAMI, told me that \u201cto keep talking about civil liberty is illogical. Patients\nare anything but free when they\u2019re at the beck and call of their own\ndelusions.\u201d In the past thirteen years, Torrey\u2019s organization, the Treatment\nAdvocacy Center, in Arlington, Virginia, has lobbied nineteen states to pass\nor strengthen outpatient commitment laws, which require people to take\nmedication after they\u2019ve been discharged. (New Hampshire Hospital uses a model\ncalled conditional discharge, but in Linda\u2019s case, since she would not discuss\ntreatment at all, her psychiatrist decided that engaging in the process would\nbe an \u201cexercise in futility.\u201d) In arguing for a more stringent approach to\ntreatment, Torrey, who is also the executive director of the Stanley Medical\nResearch Institute, which has a collection of five hundred and sixty-three\nbrains used for studying the causes of severe mental illnesses, frequently\ncites research on the significance of anosognosia. He calls it the \u201csingle\nlargest reason why individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar do not take\ntheir medications.\u201d A Treatment Advocacy Center briefing paper on anosognosia\nfeatures a quotation from a Jacobean play, \u201cThe Honest Whore,\u201d by Thomas\nDekker: \u201cThat proves you mad, because you know it not.\u201d\n\nYet the notion that denying an illness is proof of its existence is a\ndangerous one, since there are many valid reasons that people choose to refuse\ntreatment, including the stigma of having a mental illness and the disabling\nside effects of medication. Elyn Saks, a professor of law, psychology,\npsychiatry, and the behavioral sciences at the University of Southern\nCalifornia, who has schizophrenia, said, \u201cAlleviating suffering is not a\nlegitimate reason for taking away people\u2019s rights.\u201d When Saks was a law\nstudent at Yale, she was restrained and medicated against her wishes; she\ncalls it one of the most degrading experiences of her life. She argues for a\ngreater use of advance directives, which function as psychiatry\u2019s version of\nthe living will. In the past two decades, twenty-six states have passed laws\nthat allow people to specify what kind of medical care they wish to receive if\nthey lose their grasp on reality. Some directives include a \u201cUlysses\ncontract\u201d; just as Ulysses instructed that he be bound to the mast of his ship\nso that he would not be lured by the Sirens, some people insist in advance\nthat they be medicated or hospitalized even as they beg to be released. At the\nother extreme, people use directives to reject any future treatment at all.\n\nIn her book \u201cRefusing Care,\u201d Saks calls the method \u201cself-paternalism,\u201d and\nargues that there are few other scenarios in which psychiatrists should\nforcibly impose treatment that intrudes on the privacy of people\u2019s own minds.\nA widely cited justification for compulsory treatment is the \u201cthank-you\ntheory,\u201d which assumes that patients will retroactively agree that the\nintervention was in their best interests. But only about half of patients who\nhave been involuntarily hospitalized subsequently say that they needed the\ntreatment. \u201cWe should not be in the business of choosing selves,\u201d Saks writes.\nIt\u2019s impossible to determine whether a mental illness has altered someone\u2019s\npreferences, or whether that person has simply changed.\n\nThe concept of anosognosia is held in disdain by what is known as the \u201cc/s/x\nmovement,\u201d composed of consumers, survivors, and ex-patients, who argue that\nbiological explanations for mental disorders have been uncritically embraced.\nThey maintain that one of the reasons so many patients lack \u201cinsight\u201d is that\nthey are asked to accept a model of illness that doesn\u2019t resonate with their\nown experiences. Although psychotic disorders have a strong genetic component,\npopular opinion has swung so far from the logic of the psychoanalytic era,\nwhen mothers were blamed for their children\u2019s illnesses, that psychosis is\noften described as if it were inevitable and contextless\u2014a stroke of bad luck.\nDaniel Fisher, a psychiatrist with a doctorate in biochemistry, who is the\nexecutive director of the National Empowerment Center, run by former patients,\nsaid that \u201cif you accept the idea that you have this random brain disease,\nthen suddenly your sense of self, your ability to make judgments, and the most\nfundamental elements of your personality are biologically determined, and this\njust leads to a sense of meaninglessness and hopelessness.\u201d\n\nWhen Linda arrived at the house on Mountain Road, her mood oscillated between\ndespair and exhilaration at her sudden freedom. For the first time in years,\nshe saw the potential to start her life anew, on her own terms. She finally\nhad her own home, a plot of land, and no one telling her what to do.\n\nDuring her illness, the person with whom Linda felt closest was a man named\nSteve Shaclumis, whom she considered the love of her life. Steve met Linda a\nfew times in 1998\u2014\u201cshe was a nice waitress who seemed lonely,\u201d he told me\u2014but,\nbeyond calling the jail in 2005 and asking it to block Linda\u2019s letters, he\u2019d\nhad no contact since. (He was told that inmates could write to whomever they\npleased.) While in jail, Linda told Caitlin to design bridesmaid dresses for\nher and her friends, because she and Steve were getting married. \u201cHe wants a\nbig church wedding,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwhich is fine with me.\u201d\n\nLinda had spoken of Steve in rapturous tones at the beginning of her illness,\nbut she was self-conscious enough then to recognize her fantasy. She even\nwrote a letter to a friend explaining that \u201cthe process I am going through is\nnot about a relationship with Steve, it is about my relationship with myself.\u201d\nBut by the time Linda got to New Hampshire Hospital she considered herself\nSteve\u2019s wife. Now, at the house on Mountain Road, she imagined their domestic\nroutine\u2014they would eat homemade dinners and watch the sunset, holding hands,\nafter \u201cfinishing with the needs + business of the day\u201d\u2014and searched the attic\nfor clothes so she would look attractive if Steve arrived. All she could find\nwas a hat.\n\nA plan took shape. Steve would rescue her sometime near Advent, the beginning\nof the new liturgical year. After gazing at the sky and seeing a cluster of\nclouds forming the number 4, Linda determined that he\u2019d arrive by December\n4th. Using long division and multiplication tables that fill the margins of\nthe last page of her notebook, she calculated that she could survive the\n\u201cAttic + Apples chapter of this book\u201d if she limited herself to twelve apples\nper day.\n\nHaving spent two years in institutional settings with precisely timed meals\nand activities, Linda had got into the habit of checking her watch, and she\nbegan many of her diary entries, up to four a day, by noting the time. The\n\u201chigh point\u201d of each day was the moment when she crossed off another date on\nher makeshift calendar, which she usually did around four o\u2019clock. She\ndiscovered new books in the attic and under a couch\u2014\u201cWhat the Bible Is All\nAbout,\u201d \u201cMedical Self-Help Training,\u201d Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, \u201cCan\nAmerica Survive?\u201d\u2014but the days dragged. It was difficult to do anything but\nthink about food. She composed long lists of groceries, both a budget list and\na \u201cwish list\u201d (vermicelli, peperoncini, V-8, squid), and twenty-five\nvegetables she intended to grow. She imagined how she\u2019d remodel the kitchen so\nthat she could build a smokehouse like the one in \u201cLittle House in the Big\nWoods.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\n\u201cWhat the Bible Is All About\u201d was a source of inspiration, and she transcribed\na number of verses about the glory of following God\u2019s path. Psychosis commonly\ncoincides with religious reveries, and the longer Linda was off her medication\nthe more everyday occurrences seemed to be laced with hidden connections and\nsymbols. Faith in the Lord\u2019s plan for her became essential as the days\nshortened and the temperature dropped. Her neck ached, because she spent about\nsixteen hours a day curled up under blankets on a mattress, in order to stay\nwarm. So much hair fell out each time she combed it that she realized she\nmight need a temporary wig. But it was \u201cnothing a little fresh air, sunshine,\nexercise, good food + love won\u2019t remedy in a short period of time.\u201d\n\nLinda looked out for Steve\u2019s white Chevy truck, but by the beginning of\nDecember her conviction began to waver. \u201cSo maybe the fact that I haven\u2019t seen\nhim is a good sign?\u201d she wrote. \u201cI just hope God does want us to be\ntogether\u2014everything seems to assure that\u2014but who knows how it all fits.\nCertainly my death at this point does not seem beneficial to God\u2019s plans as\nperceived by me.\u201d\n\nOn December 4th, the sight of Christmas lights on a house down the road made\nher break into tears. She and Caitlin had always enjoyed decorating their tree\nto excess, and she hadn\u2019t seen a lit-up house in two years. By afternoon,\nSteve still hadn\u2019t arrived. Linda was so desperate that she contemplated\nwalking to a neighbor\u2019s house and calling a domestic-violence center. But she\nworried that Satan\u2019s workers could be waiting for her. \u201cDear God,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cPlease save me. I\u2019m trying but don\u2019t know what to do. Amen.\u201d\n\nThe next day, she ate the last of her apples.\n\nOn the morning of December 5th, Linda started a new journal, a spiral-bound\ncomposition notebook with full-sized pages that made it easier for her to\nwrite while sitting in the \u201chot seat,\u201d a chair she had placed over the only\nworking heating vent in the house. Although the previous night had been\n\u201ctough,\u201d she felt calm and hopeful as she watched the sun rise. The concerns\nof everyday living briefly receded, and the story she was writing, a tale of\nlove and redemption, became her reality again. \u201cI love my husband so much\u2014and\nhe has done so much to keep me going and give me hope,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI can\u2019t\nleave him or give up.\u201d\n\nShe tried reflecting on the positive aspects of her situation\u2014she no longer\nhad to deal with the \u201cbabble or yammering\u201d or lies of the hospital\u2014but there\nwas still the problem of her \u201cmeal plan.\u201d The following day, she wrote,\n\u201cFacing death by starvation was horrifying and traumatic\u2014and took quite awhile\nto adjust and consider the whole situation rationally and spiritually.\u201d She\ndecided that she had to leave the house. \u201cBefore when things needed to change\n(my location) I always knew\u2014but usually there was an exterior human\nimpetus\u2014however if I stay here\u2014I will die.\u201d She planned to hitchhike to the\nhome of an elderly couple, friends of her parents, who lived a few miles away.\nShe would get food, take a shower, and do laundry. From there, she would head\nto the supported-housing program in Manchester, where she had lived in 2003,\nthe year that her sister thought she had finally recovered.\n\nBut walking to the kitchen made her so dizzy that her vision failed. She\ncouldn\u2019t imagine how she would get to the road, which was about twenty yards\naway. She had never doubted her decision to live in the house, and it didn\u2019t\nseem right to abandon faith at such a late stage. \u201cSo I\u2019ll wait,\u201d she wrote,\n\u201cand continue to pray since God knows where I am.\u201d\n\nLinda had never intended to \u201cbe clinging to life like some idiot,\u201d she wrote,\nbut there was also something willful about her withdrawal from human contact.\nShe knew that if she re\u00ebntered society people would be \u201ccoding me \u2018disabled.\u2019\n\u201d After praying out loud one night, she even questioned whether God \u201chas given\nme a good brain to figure out what to do.\u201d She seemed to accept the premises\nof two conflicting realities, a phenomenon known as \u201cdouble bookkeeping,\u201d in\nwhich psychotic patients who are able to distinguish reality from fantasy go\non living and believing in both. Even the patient convinced that he is Christ\nwill abide by hospital curfew and take out the trash. People rarely lack\ninsight in an absolute sense. Solitude allowed Linda\u2019s delusions to flourish,\nand at times she seemed aware of this; she kept away from anyone who could\nchallenge her interpretation of the world.\n\nWith the winter weather, Linda\u2019s daily chores required less movement. She\nsnapped icicles off the porch or scooped up bowls of snow and melted them on\nthe heat register, which took about an hour. The task of \u201charvesting\u201d water\nwas the central activity of her days. She took care to move slowly, since she\nhad already fainted once and had fallen in the kitchen. She conserved energy\nby lying still on the living-room floor near the register, absorbing its\n\u201cradiant warmth.\u201d To keep her mind active, she forced herself to read the\ndictionary, but she never got past the letter \u201cK.\u201d\n\nOn Christmas, Linda reached out the window to get snow for what she predicted\nwould be the last time. Most of the entries that follow are only a few words\nlong, written in faint, uneven letters, because she wrote lying down. Her\nfinal note was on January 13, 2008, and it contains nothing more than the day\nof the week, Sunday. It had been thirty-nine days since she ate her last\napple.\n\nOn the first page of the notebook, Linda left a note addressed to \u201cwhomever\nfinds my body,\u201d in which she explained that her death would be the result of\ndomestic violence: \u201cI talked with and wrote to many people in position of\nauthority about this\u2014but no one helped me.\u201d She asked to be buried in the\ncemetery of the town where she had lived when Caitlin was a child and ended\nthe letter with a request, underlined in broad strokes, \u201cJesus take me home.\u201d\n\nJoan Bishop discovered that her sister had been discharged from the hospital\nwhen a Christmas card she sent to Linda was returned in the mail three months\nlater. The envelope contained a slip of paper with a new address listed for\nLinda, but the location didn\u2019t exist. After all her attempts to get her sister\ntreatment, Joan was furious that the hospital had \u201clet her walk off the face\nof the earth.\u201d \u201cI work for the justice system; I believe in the justice\nsystem,\u201d she said. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you have the right to rot\naway.\u201d\n\nJoan and Caitlin sued the hospital for failing to properly plan Linda\u2019s\ndischarge, relying on the police as her only safety net. \u201cAsk the daughter!\u201d\nCaitlin said. \u201cI could have told them that every time the structure is gone\nshe goes straight down the tubes.\u201d The attorneys representing the hospital\nargued that Linda\u2019s doctors had a legal duty to allow her the right to live in\nthe least restrictive setting that her disability allowed. They ended up\narguing the case that Linda had been making all along: she wasn\u2019t that ill. In\nthe written mediation statement, the attorneys maintained that Linda was\nmaking a reasoned decision to pursue an alternative life style. As evidence,\nthey pointed to lucid passages in the journal found at the house after her\ndeath: the pleasure she took in identifying birds and commenting on the shapes\nof clouds; the fact that she realized her unkempt appearance might bring her\nto the attention of authorities who could hospitalize her again.\n\nCaitlin read the journal, and was hurt that she appeared in it only once, when\nLinda wrote about a dream in which Caitlin was calling out for her. \u201cI\u2019ll\nnever understand that, because my mom was always thinking of me,\u201d she told me.\nAlthough the suit was settled in mediation for a small sum, Caitlin seemed\nambivalent about whether she could blame the doctors. She holds on to an image\nof a mother who was obstinate and purposeful, rather than overwhelmed by an\nillness. \u201cThe woman who wrote that journal\u2014that was not my mother,\u201d she said.\n\nLinda\u2019s body was found in early May, when a man interested in buying the house\non Mountain Road peered through a window. He contacted the police, who called\nthe owners of the house, a brother and sister who had inherited the property\nfrom their parents. One of the owners had checked on the house around\nChristmas, but she never went inside, because the driveway was covered in snow\nand there were no footprints. When Caitlin learned of her mother\u2019s death, she\nresponded as if she had been waiting for the news for a long time. \u201cMy mom\nmade a choice\u2014she could have walked out of that house,\u201d she said. \u201cBut she\nwouldn\u2019t give up her freedom. She could never let go of that person she always\nwanted to be.\u201d \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the May 30, 2011, issue.\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * The day the dinosaurs died.\n\n  * What if you started itching\u2014and couldn\u2019t stop?\n\n  * How a notorious gangster was exposed by his own sister.\n\n  * Woodstock was overrated.\n\n  * Diana Nyad\u2019s hundred-and-eleven-mile swim.\n\n  * Photo Booth: Deana Lawson\u2019s hyper-staged portraits of Black love.\n\n  * Fiction by Roald Dahl: \u201cThe Landlady\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nRachel Aviv is a staff writer at The New Yorker.
