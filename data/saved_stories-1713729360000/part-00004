In parallel, control over the\ntemporal characteristics of strong light fields has allowed researchers to\nmanipulate coherent electron transport in such atom-thin structures on\nsublaser-cycle timescales^3,4. Here we demonstrate a tailored light-wave-\ndriven analogue to twisted layer stacking. Tailoring the spatial symmetry of\nthe light waveform to that of the lattice of a hexagonal boron nitride\nmonolayer and then twisting this waveform result in optical control of time-\nreversal symmetry breaking^5 and the realization of the topological Haldane\nmodel^6 in a laser-dressed two-dimensional insulating crystal. Further, the\nparameters of the effective Haldane-type Hamiltonian can be controlled by\nrotating the light waveform, thus enabling ultrafast switching between band\nstructure configurations and allowing unprecedented control over the\nmagnitude, location and curvature of the bandgap. This results in an\nasymmetric population between complementary quantum valleys that leads to a\nmeasurable valley Hall current^7, which can be detected by optical harmonic\npolarimetry. The universality and robustness of our scheme paves the way to\nvalley-selective bandgap engineering on the fly and unlocks the possibility of\ncreating few-femtosecond switches with quantum degrees of freedom.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Direct observation of a magnetic-field-induced Wigner crystal\n\nArticle 10 April 2024\n\nYen-Chen Tsui, Minhao He, ...

Archana Raja\n\n## Main\n\nDiscrete symmetries in quantum mechanics, namely spatial inversion and time\nreversal, play a pivotal role in governing the electronic and topological\nproperties of materials^6,8,9. For example, when both the symmetries are\npreserved in hexagonal monolayers such as graphene, the highest valence and\nlowest conduction bands are connected by Dirac-like dispersion at the high-\nsymmetry K and K\u2032 points of the Brillouin zone, enabling semimetal-like\nbehaviour^9. When the spatial-inversion symmetry is broken, foar example, in\nmonolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) (Fig. 1a), a bandgap (\u0394) appears along\nwith a parabolic band dispersion around the K and K\u2032 points, leading to\ninsulating behaviour (\u0394_K,K\u2032 \u2248 5.9 eV for hBN)^10. The two energy-degenerate\nlocal band minima at the K and K\u2032 points are quantum valleys and are time-\nreversal partners. When time-reversal symmetry is broken, carrier dynamics at\nK and K\u2032 can be distinguished (Fig. 1b). One paradigmatic example is the toy\nmodel of a Chern insulator proposed by F. D. M. Haldane^6. Here time-reversal\nsymmetry is envisioned as being broken by a staggered magnetic field in gapped\ngraphene, thus inducing complex next-nearest neighbour (CNNN) hoppings that\nmodify the relative bandgap at the valleys (Fig. 1c). Another relevant example\nis the work of Xiao et al.^11, who proposed valley-selective excitation by\nresonant circularly polarized light in gapped graphene, which has been\ndemonstrated in various two-dimensional transition metal\ndichalcogenides^12,13,developing the field of\nvalleytronics^12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\nFig. 1: Light-wave-controlled valley-selective bandgap modification.\n\na, The tailored intense light waveform, which resembles a trefoil structure on\nthe lattice plane, is used to coherently manipulate the band structure of\nmonolayer hBN. b, For such a two-dimensional system, the band structure shows\nhexagonal symmetry with a minimum bandgap at the K and K\u2032 points (valleys) at\nthe vertices of the hexagon. In monolayer hBN, the optical bandgap is \u0394 \u2248 5.9\neV. c, Upon interaction with a strong trefoil waveform, the couplings between\nthe atoms are modified. The laser-dressed system is described by a Haldane-\ntype tight-binding Hamiltonian, such that the next-nearest neighbour hoppings\nare complex and carry a phase difference of \u03c0 between the two sublattices,\nwith on-site energies \u0394/2 and \u2212\u0394/2. d\u2013g, As the field (and its associated\nvector potential shown with respect to the first Brillouin zone) rotates in\nspace, the CNNN hoppings are modified, changing from purely real (d,f) to\npurely imaginary (e,g). In d and f, the waveform points in between K and K\u2032\n(that is, M), but with different orientations. In e and g, it points to K and\nK\u2032, respectively. The latter lifts the degeneracy between the K and K\u2032\nvalleys, reducing the bandgap in one of them and increasing it in the other.\nh, The effective bandgap oscillates as a function of the rotation of the\ntrefoil light field, leading to different electron excitation dynamics between\nthe valleys. i\u2013l, Normalized electron populations in the conduction band\ncorresponding to the trefoil field orientation shown in the inset of d\u2013g. This\nis calculated using the code described in ref. ^44. The green hexagons delimit\nthe first Brillouin zones, with the K and K\u2032 points at the vertices, as\nindicated in the inset of d\u2013g. The purple triangles indicate the orientation\nof the vector potential. The electron population is a maximum in the valley\nwhere the bandgap is lower during the laser\u2013matter interaction. a.u.,\narbitrary units.\n\nFull size image\n\nControlling the spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetries allows us to\nengineer the material properties, including those not found naturally in\npristine materials. By vertical stacking of two-dimensional materials with\nmatching spatial symmetry, we can create composite multilayer structures with\na different symmetry and electronic properties than those of the individual\nlayers^20, which can be further manipulated by controlling the stacking\nangle^1,2. Moreover, applying external time-dependent electric and magnetic\nfields allows us to induce and control transient material properties that may\nnot be naturally found in thermal equilibrium. Previous works have shown using\nFloquet theory that the frequency, intensity and helicity of long-pulse-\nduration electric fields can be exploited as additional degrees of freedom to\nmodify the Hamiltonian parameters of a crystal during an\ninteraction^21,22,23,24 on the timescale of the pulse duration^25. In light-\nwave electronics^3,4,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40, one\nexploits control over the temporal characteristics of strong light fields,\nsuch as the carrier envelope phase of single-cycle pulses or the time delay\nbetween multicolour fields, to manipulate coherent electronic transport on\ntimescales shorter than one laser cycle.\n\nHere we introduce a light-wave-driven counterpart to twisted layer stacking in\nhexagonal materials. We use the matching between the threefold symmetry of the\ncrystal lattice and the structured spatial waveform of the light field, a\ndegree of freedom that we control with sublaser-cycle precision (Fig. 1a). By\nrotating the structured light wave in space, we demonstrate subcycle-\ncontrolled time-resolved symmetry breaking and valley bandgap control in an\ninsulating hBN monolayer, thus realizing a light-driven analogue to the\ntopological model of Haldane. Our scheme enables symmetry-protected and\nselective bandgap manipulation on the fly for light-wave electronics and two-\ndimensional materials engineering, which we exploit here to demonstrate a\nbelow-resonant, strong-field regime for ultrafast valleytronics in an\ninsulating quantum system.\n\n## Light analogue of the Haldane model\n\nTwo counter-rotating circularly polarized fields of frequencies \u03c9 and 2\u03c9\ncombine to produce a strong tailored light wave whose projection on the hBN\ncrystal plane resembles a trefoil structure, which matches the triangular\nlattice of hBN. Such a field induces CNNN hoppings in the hBN monolayer during\nthe laser\u2013matter interaction^5 (Fig. 1c and Methods). In analogy to the\ntopological model of Haldane^6, the laser-induced CNNN hoppings break time-\nreversal symmetry and lift the degeneracy of the valleys, thus reducing the\nbandgap in one and increasing it in the other depending on the CNNN hopping\nangle \u03c6 (Fig. 1c). The latter is controlled by the orientation of the vector\npotential of the waveform (Methods). Changing the phase delay between the \u03c9\nand 2\u03c9 pulses rotates the electric field and the vector potential and modifies\nthe CNNN hopping and band structure, as shown in Fig. 1d\u2013g (ref. ^5 and\nMethods). Owing to the periodicity of both the trefoil waveform and the\nlattice, the same dynamics are repeated every 120\u00b0. Figure 1h shows the\npredicted variation of the effective bandgap at the K and K\u2032 valleys for\ndifferent orientations of the vector potential relative to the Brillouin zone\nof the hBN crystal, which exceeds 5 eV for our experimental conditions (laser\nfield strength F_L \u2248 0.7 V \u00c5^\u22121 and frequency \u03c9 = 0.6 eV).\n\nThe light field that modifies the band structure is strong and has a frequency\nwell below the equilibrium bandgap (\u03c9 \u00ab \u0394_K,K\u2032 = 5.9 eV), which drives tunnel\nexcitation of carriers from the valence to the conduction band close to the\neffective minimum bandgap. Thus, in the presence of the laser-induced valley-\ncontrasting band structure modification indicated above, the resulting valley\npopulations should oscillate as the trefoil waveform is rotated, with strong\nK\u2032 (K) valley polarization when the vector potential is oriented as outlined\nin Fig. 1e (Fig. 1g). We performed time-dependent simulations for a two-band\nmodel of gapped graphene using the crystal parameters of monolayer hBN under\nour experimental conditions. Figure 1i\u2013l shows the electron populations\ncalculated after the interaction with a trefoil field with fixed helicity for\nthe four spatial orientations outlined in Fig. 1d\u2013g. Electrons predominantly\npopulate the valley where the bandgap is reduced, highlighting valley-\ncontrasting band modification.\n\nFigure 1i\u2013l shows that two visible simultaneous mechanisms play a role in the\noverall valley polarization. On the one hand, the bandgaps at the K and K\u2032\nvalleys become asymmetric owing to the tailored strong light field\ninteraction, as discussed above. This effect is dependent only on the\norientation of the vector potential relative to the lattice. On the other, the\nhelicity of the driving field (and its associated vector potential) induces\nvalley-contrasting dynamics, as in conventional valleytronics^11,12,13, and is\nindependent of the rotation angle. In our regime, the former largely dominates\nthe valley excitation dynamics, as can be seen by the valley population\noscillating and switching as a function of the trefoil orientation for a fixed\nhelicity. There are, however, visible effects of the helicity-dependent valley\ncircular dichroism apparent in the simulations. In particular, the electron\npopulations at K and K\u2032 do not merely flip between \\\\(\\theta ={60}^{^\\circ\n}\\\\) and \\\\(\\theta ={120}^{^\\circ }\\\\) (compare with Fig. 1j,l). For a\ncomplete flip between K and K\u2032, one must change both the orientation of the\nvector potential and its helicity, which provides the time-reversal partner\nfield. Still, valley polarization can be clearly switched without changing the\nfield helicity by rotating the waveform, as is evident in Fig. 1j,l, and its\noscillation provides a telltale sign of the modification of the band structure\ntopology.\n\n## Subcycle-controlled, non-resonant valleytronics\n\nIn the experiment, we prepared the pump trefoil waveform by\ninterferometrically combining two counter-rotating, circularly polarized,\nlight waves of about 30 fs and with an intensity ratio of 2:1 (Fig. 2a). The\nbroadband spectra (Extended Data Fig. 7) of these mutually phase-stable\ncomponents were centred around 2 \u03bcm (frequency \u03c9 and photon energy 0.6 eV) and\n1 \u03bcm (frequency 2\u03c9 and photon energy 1.2 eV), respectively. We used a pump\nintensity of about 4\u20137 TW cm^\u2212^2 in air without observing any damage. The\norientation of the trefoil waveform with respect to the fixed hBN lattice\nstructure was controlled by the subcycle time delay between the \u03c9 and 2\u03c9 light\nwaves. Further details are given in Methods.\n\nFig. 2: All-optical methodology to control and probe the bandgap engineering\nwith application to valleytronics.\n\na, Monolayer hBN mounted on a 500 \u03bcm, thin, fused-silica substrate was pumped\nwith a 30-fs-long trefoil waveform. The light wave was generated by\ninterferometrically combining a counter-rotating circularly polarized 2 \u03bcm (\u03c9)\nand 1 \u03bcm (2\u03c9) wavelength light with an intensity ratio of 2:1. Its different\norientation with respect to the real-space lattice orientation was achieved by\ncontrolling the subcycle delay (\u0394t_\u03c9\u22122\u03c9) between the \u03c9 and 2\u03c9 pulses. A time-\ndelayed (\u0394t_pump\u2013probe), linearly polarized, 2 \u03bcm wavelength pulse measures\nthe pump-induced valley dynamics through time-resolved harmonic polarimetry of\nits third harmonic. The polarization state of the generated third harmonic,\nanalysed by a quarter-wave plate and Wollaston prism, encode the information\nabout the induced valley polarization. Eventually, the spectrally filtered and\nspecially separated s-polarized (s-pol.) and p-polarized (p-pol.) components\nare captured with photodiodes, which are connected to a two-channel lock-in\namplifier for data acquisition. b, The microscopic geometry of the interaction\nrestricts it within a region of 10 \u03bcm, comparable to that of the\nmonocrystalline patch. c, 3\u03c9 yield as a function of wavelength for pump (blue)\nand probe (red) irradiation. d, Sketch of Berry curvature in the conduction\nband of monolayer hBN. e\u2013g, Three representative probing configurations. e,\nThe K and K\u2032 valleys are equally populated, resulting in a net-zero anomalous\nHall current (depicted with curved blue arrows) and a linearly polarized third\nharmonic. f,g, The asymmetry in the electron populations between the K and K\u2032\nvalleys results in a non-zero Hall current, creating an elliptical third-\nharmonic signal with valley-dependent helicity. In f, the K valley is more\npopulated, whereas the K\u2032 valley is more populated in g, resulting in\ndominance of opposite helicities (indicated by asymmetric curved arrows) in\nthe third harmonic.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo measure the valley polarization as a function of the pump trefoil rotation,\nwe measured the valley-dependent changes induced by the pump on the\npolarization of the nonlinear (third harmonic) response of a time-delayed,\nlinearly polarized, probe light field. All-optical probing offers simplicity\nand potential for seamless integration into future all-optical photonic\ntechnologies. However, note that other techniques, such as angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy or measurements of\nthe transport valley Hall current, can be also applied to probe the valley\npopulation in the present scheme.\n\nWe separated a small portion of the fundamental 2 \u03bcm (\u03c9) beam, with linear\npolarization and a pulse duration of about 30 fs, and delayed it by\napproximately 60\u2013120 fs with respect to the trefoil pump pulse. The linearly\npolarized probe field \\\\({E}_{{\\rm{probe}}}\\\\) generated a drift current along\nthe polarization axis, as well as an anomalous (orthogonal) current that was\nproportional to the population asymmetry at the complementary\nvalleys^5,7,15,41:\n\n$${j}_{{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{n}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{m}}{\\rm{a}}{\\rm{l}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{u}}{\\rm{s}}}(t)=\\frac{{e}^{2}}{{\\hbar\n(2{\\rm{\\pi }})}^{2}}{E}_{{\\rm{p}}{\\rm{r}}{\\rm{o}}{\\rm{b}}{\\rm{e}}}(t)\\sum\n_{n}{\\int }_{{\\rm{B}}{\\rm{Z}}}\\,{\\rm{d}}{{\\boldsymbol{k}}\\rho\n}_{nn}({\\boldsymbol{k}},t){\\Omega }_{n}({\\boldsymbol{k}}),$$\n\nwhere e is the electron charge, \\\\({\\rho }_{nn}\\\\) is the population of band\n\\\\(n\\\\) and \\\\(\\Omega ({\\boldsymbol{k}})\\\\) is its Berry curvature.\n\nThe drift current is governed by the vector potential of the field, whereas\nthe anomalous current is proportional to the electric field. This leads to a\n\\\\({\\rm{\\pi }}/2\\\\) phase-delay difference between these components and, thus,\nto the emission of elliptically polarized harmonic radiation. Note that the\nBerry curvatures around the K and K\u2032 valleys exhibit opposite signs (Fig. 2d),\n\\\\({\\Omega }_{n}({\\rm{K}})=-{\\Omega }_{n}({{\\rm{K}}}^{{\\prime} })\\\\). In the\nabsence of valley polarization, \\\\({\\rho }_{nn}({\\rm{K}})={\\rho\n}_{nn}({{\\rm{K}}}^{{\\prime} })\\\\), the anomalous current cancels, and the\nnonlinear optical response induced by the probe field is linearly polarized.\nIn contrast, when there is valley polarization, \\\\({\\rho }_{nn}({\\rm{K}})\\ne\n{\\rho }_{nn}({{\\rm{K}}}^{{\\prime} })\\\\), the anomalous current is non-zero and\nits sign is opposite for K and K\u2032 valley polarization. This makes the optical\nresponse of the probe elliptical and with opposing helicity for K and K\u2032\nvalley polarization (Fig. 2e\u2013g). Hence, the valley polarization induced by the\ntrefoil pump field is mapped onto the asymmetry \\\\(\\alpha\n=\\frac{{{\\rm{S}}}_{1}-{{\\rm{S}}}_{2}}{{{\\rm{S}}}_{1}+{{\\rm{S}}}_{2}}\\\\) of the\ntwo helicity components \\\\({{\\rm{S}}}_{1}\\\\) and \\\\({{\\rm{S}}}_{2}\\\\) of the\nprobe harmonic (3\u03c9 in the present case)^5,42. Experimentally, we determined\nboth the helicity and ellipticity by measuring the s- and p-polarized\ncomponents of the outgoing 3\u03c9 probe radiation by two photodiodes following a\ncombination of a quarter-wave plate and a Wollaston prism. During the\nexperiment we rotated the pump trefoil waveform for a fixed delay and\npolarization of the probe pulse; the sample and other parameters of the\nexperiment were kept fixed.\n\nWhen the laser irradiated only the fused silica, we observed no characteristic\nmodulation as a function of the pump trefoil rotation and for a fixed\npump\u2013probe delay, as shown in Fig. 3a (orange curve). In striking contrast,\nwhen the hBN sample was irradiated, both diodes displayed clear oscillating\nsignals with a dominant 120\u00b0 periodicity (red and green curves in Fig. 3a).\nThe Fourier analysis in Fig. 3b confirms strong 120\u00b0 periodic oscillations,\nwith one of the diodes also showing a contribution of its second order (60\u00b0\nperiodic oscillation). All these experimental features are fully consistent\nwith the interpretation given above and reproduced by time-dependent\nsimulations on a gapped-graphene system, as shown in Fig. 3c. As in the\nexperiment, the simulations measure the 3\u03c9 helicity signal of a probe field\nthat is co-rotating (green curve) or counter-rotating (red curve) with the \u03c9\nfield of the trefoil, which correspond to the signals \\\\({{\\rm{S}}}_{1}\\\\)\n(green curve) and \\\\({{\\rm{S}}}_{2}\\\\) (red curve), respectively, measured at\nthe diodes.\n\nFig. 3: Comparison between experimental and theoretical results.\n\na, Experimentally obtained helicity-resolved third-harmonic (3\u03c9) yield as a\nfunction of pump trefoil rotation. The blue and red curves present data of two\nphotodiode currents measured during the exposure of the hBN sample.\nRepresentative data for exposure of only the fused-silica substrate is\nrepresented by the yellow curve. The solid line was produced by taking the\nstatistical mean of all the photodiode current data points recorded within a\nbin size of 3\u00b0.

The experimental curve was obtained after Fourier\nfiltering around the frequency corresponding to the 120\u00b0 oscillation, as shown\nin the inset. amp., amplitude; norm., normalized; rot., rotating.\n\nFull size image\n\nFirst, we discuss the origin of the 60\u00b0 oscillation. Comparing Fig. 1j and\nFig. 1l, we see that the population at the K valley oscillates less than that\nat K\u2032. As we mentioned earlier, this reflects that a 60\u00b0 rotation of the field\nalone does not produce the time-reversal partner field; for this, one must\nchange the helicity of the field as well. Thus, the valley polarization\noscillation as a function of pump rotation is not a perfect sinusoidal curve\nof 120\u00b0 periodicity and leads to the appearance of higher-order Fourier\ncomponents (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4 for further details).\n\nWe now focus on the 120\u00b0 oscillation by Fourier filtering this component only.\nIn particular, we are interested in the asymmetry parameter \\\\(\\alpha \\\\) of\nthe two helicities, which maps the valley polarization. This is shown in Fig.\n3d. This parameter changes sign in both the experimental and theoretical data,\nwhich signals a switch in the valley polarization. The asymmetry curve\noscillates from a positive maximum at \\\\(\\theta ={60}^{^\\circ }\\\\),\ncorresponding to K\u2032 valley polarization (Fig. 1j), to a negative maximum at\n\\\\(\\theta ={120}^{^\\circ }\\\\), corresponding to K valley polarization (Fig.\n1l), and is zero in the absence of valley polarization, for \\\\(\\theta\n={30}^{^\\circ }\\\\) and \\\\({90}^{^\\circ }\\\\). The oscillation and switch of the\nvalley polarization as a function of the pump trefoil rotation, for a fixed\npump helicity, are evidence of the trefoil-field-induced modification of the\nband structure.\n\n## Light-induced valley bandgap reduction\n\nFigure 4a shows the scaling of the oscillation amplitude of the 3\u03c9 signal of\nthe linearly polarized probe with the intensity of the pump trefoil field. As\nthe pump trefoil intensity is increased, the theory predicts a larger bandgap\nasymmetry at the valleys (inset in Fig. 4a) and, thus, a larger valley\npolarization. This observation is reproduced in the experiment. Furthermore,\nthe strength of the 60\u00b0 oscillations increases with increasing trefoil field\nstrength, reaching the same value as the 120\u00b0 oscillation at around 7 TW\ncm^\u2212^2. This suggests that there is a gradual increase of the effect of\nhelicity-dependent valley physics, which should be stronger when the effective\nbandgap approaches a value comparable to the photon energy.\n\nFig. 4: Pump intensity scaling of bandgap modification and temporal dynamics\nof valley polarization.\n\na, Fourier amplitudes of the 3\u03c9 co-rotating signal as a function of pump\nintensity.

The\ndashed line serves as guide for the eye. The error bars represent standard\ndeviations for an ensemble of measurements. Expt., experimental.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Strong-field-induced valley lifetime\n\nWe additionally performed experiments at various pump\u2013probe time delays.\nFigure 4b shows the Fourier amplitude of the 120\u00b0 oscillation of the 3\u03c9 probe\nsignal for pump\u2013probe delays between 60\u2013120 fs. For delay times shorter than\n60 fs, we obtained a random signal in the Fourier analysis due to the temporal\noverlap between the pump and probe fields, which distorts the trefoil\nstructure. Above 60 fs, the signal gradually decreases until 120 fs, where it\nfalls below the noise floor. Thus, we estimate that valley population\nasymmetry in hBN persists for about 60 fs following a strong-field excitation.\nNote that this timescale might differ from that measured after one-photon\nresonant excitations, for which the electron distribution is more localized in\nthe valleys^16. All measurements were performed at ambient temperature.\n\n## Conclusion and outlook\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that a below-resonant strong light field with\npolarization tailored to the crystal symmetry induces a waveform-controlled\nCNNN hopping that breaks time-reversal symmetry in a laser-dressed hBN\nmonolayer. In this way, we realized the light analogue of the Haldane model\nwith the parameters of this model controlled on sub-laser-cycle timescales. We\nshowed that the rotation of the waveform modifies the magnitude and location\nof the bandgap, enabling non-resonant valley polarization switching in an\ninsulating monolayer of hBN that we measured using time-resolved optical\nharmonic polarimetry. These experiments extend valleytronics to the few-\nfemtosecond timescale and to a wider range of materials, which may include\ncombinations of semiconducting and insulating monolayers, that have been out\nof reach due to large optical bandgaps or symmetry constraints. Indeed, in\nparallel to this work, Tyulnev et al.^43 demonstrated strong-tailored-field-\ninduced valley manipulation in bulk MoS_2. Additionally, we estimated that hBN\nhas a valley lifetime of about 60 fs at ambient temperature when driven by\nstrong, tailored light fields. This is around nine cycles of our optical\nfield. These results may encourage future studies of room-temperature\nultrafast switches with strong tailored light. The waveform-driven, valley-\ncontrasting, bandgap modification is symmetry-robust, subfemtosecond-\ncontrollable and reversible, and it preserves electron coherence, thus opening\na new route towards the ultrafast control of material properties. Our work may\noffer a non-equilibrium, light-driven counterpart to twisted layer stacking,\nfor example by patterning the light wave such that the trefoil shape rotates\nspatially along the beam profile, thus creating micrometre-sized domains in\nthe material with different electronic properties, like Moir\u00e9 patterning.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Theoretical model and simulations\n\nThe model was described in detail in ref. ^5. Here we provide further details\nof its derivation and application to our case. Atomic units are used unless\notherwise stated.\n\n#### Definition of the lattice\n\nHexagonal boron nitride is formed from two triangular sublattices A and B,\nwhich host boron and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Extended Data Fig. 1a shows\nthe lattice up to next-nearest neighbour atoms. The two lattice vectors can be\ndefined as\n\n$$\\begin{array}{cc} &\n{{\\bf{a}}}_{1}=\\frac{{r}_{0}}{2}\\left(3,\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\\\\\ {\\rm{and}} &\n{{\\bf{a}}}_{2}=\\frac{{r}_{0}}{2}\\left(3,-\\sqrt{3}\\right),\\end{array}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\\\({r}_{0}\\\\) is the distance between nearest neighbours. The distance\nfrom atom \\\\(j\\\\) to atom \\\\(i\\\\) can be written in terms of \\\\({r}_{0}\\\\) and\nthe angle \\\\(\\alpha \\\\) between those two atoms (Extended Data Fig. 1a):\n\n$$\\left[{r}_{{ij},x},{r}_{{ij},y}\\right]={\\left(\\sqrt{3}\\right)}^{m}{r}_{0}\\left[\\sin\n{\\alpha }_{{ij}},\\cos {\\alpha }_{{ij}},\\right],$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \\\\(m=0,1\\\\) for nearest neighbours and next-nearest neighbours,\nrespectively. The Brillouin zone of hBN is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1b,\nalong with its high-symmetry points.\n\n#### Definition of the field\n\nWe start with a bicircular field vector, which results from the combination of\ntwo counter-rotating circular fields of frequencies \\\\(\\omega \\\\) and\n\\\\(2\\omega \\\\). We define it as\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}{{\\bf{F}}}_{\\circlearrowright\n}(t)=[{F}_{x}(t),{F}_{y}(t)]=[{F}_{\\omega }\\sin (\\omega t)-{F}_{2\\omega }\\sin\n(2\\omega t+\\varphi ),\\\\\\ {F}_{\\omega }\\cos (\\omega t)+{F}_{2\\omega }\\cos\n(2\\omega t+\\varphi )].\\end{array}$$\n\n(3)\n\nThe field strengths of the fundamental and second-harmonic fields are\n\\\\({F}_{\\omega }\\\\) and \\\\({F}_{2\\omega }\\\\), respectively, and \\\\(\\varphi \\\\)\nis the phase delay between the two fields. From the electric field, we define\nthe vector potential \\\\({\\bf{A}}\\left(t\\right)=-\\int\n\\,{\\rm{d}}t\\,{\\bf{F}}\\left(t\\right)\\\\), so that\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}{{\\bf{A}}}_{\\circlearrowright\n}(t)=[{A}_{x}(t),{A}_{y}(t)]=\\left[\\frac{{F}_{\\omega }}{\\omega }\\cos (\\omega\nt)-\\frac{{F}_{2\\omega }}{2\\omega }\\cos (2\\omega t+\\varphi ),\\right.\\\\\\\n\\left.-\\frac{{F}_{\\omega }}{\\omega }\\sin (\\omega t)-\\frac{{F}_{2\\omega\n}}{2\\omega }\\sin (2\\omega t+\\varphi )\\right].\\end{array}$$\n\n(4)\n\nWith this definition, both the electric field and the vector potential rotate\nclockwise. When we switch the helicities of the two circular fields such that\n\\\\(\\left[{F}_{x}\\left(t\\right),{F}_{y}\\left(t\\right)\\right]\\to\n\\left[-{F}_{x}\\left(t\\right),{F}_{y}\\left(t\\right)\\right]\\\\), we obtain\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{\\bf{F}}}_{\\circlearrowleft }(t)=[-{F}_{\\omega }\\sin\n(\\omega t)+{F}_{2\\omega }\\sin (2\\omega t+\\varphi ),\\\\\\ \\,\\,{F}_{\\omega }\\cos\n(\\omega t)+{F}_{2\\omega }\\cos (2\\omega t+\\varphi )]\\end{array}$$\n\n(5)\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{\\bf{A}}}_{\\circlearrowleft }(t)=\\left[-\\frac{{F}_{\\omega\n}}{\\omega }\\cos (\\omega t)+\\frac{{F}_{2\\omega }}{2\\omega }\\cos (2\\omega\nt+\\varphi ),\\right.\\\\\\ \\,\\,\\left.-\\frac{{F}_{1}}{\\omega }\\sin (\\omega\nt)-\\frac{{F}_{2}}{2\\omega }\\sin (2\\omega t+\\varphi )\\right].\\end{array}$$\n\n(6)\n\nIn this case, both the electric field and vector potential rotate\nanticlockwise. Between \\\\({{\\bf{F}}}_{\\circlearrowright }\\\\) and\n\\\\({{\\bf{F}}}_{\\circlearrowleft }\\\\), the field has rotated in space by 180\u00b0\n(compare the green curves in Extended Data Fig. 2a,d). However, the\norientation of the vector potential is the same for\n\\\\({{\\bf{A}}}_{\\circlearrowright }\\\\) and \\\\({{\\bf{A}}}_{\\circlearrowleft }\\\\)\n(compare the purple curves in Extended Data Fig. 2b,e).\n\nFor generality, let us also consider the bicircular field defined as\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}{\\mathop{{\\bf{F}}}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{\\circlearrowright\n}(t)=[{\\mathop{F}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{x}(t),{\\mathop{F}\\limits^{ \\sim\n}}_{y}(t)]=[{F}_{\\omega }\\cos (\\omega t)+{F}_{2\\omega }\\cos (2\\omega t+\\varphi\n),\\\\\\ \\,\\,\\,\\,-{F}_{\\omega }\\sin (\\omega t)+{F}_{2\\omega }\\sin (2\\omega\nt+\\varphi )]\\end{array}$$\n\n(7)\n\nand, consequently,\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathop{{\\bf{A}}}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{\\circlearrowright\n}(t)=[{\\mathop{A}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{x}(t),{\\mathop{A}\\limits^{ \\sim\n}}_{y}(t)]=\\left[-\\frac{{F}_{\\omega }}{\\omega }\\sin (\\omega\nt)-\\frac{{F}_{2\\omega }}{2\\omega }\\sin (2\\omega t+\\varphi ),\\right.\\\\\\\n\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\left.-\\frac{{F}_{\\omega }}{\\omega }\\cos (\\omega\nt)+\\frac{{F}_{2\\omega }}{2\\omega }\\cos (2\\omega t+\\varphi\n)\\right].\\end{array}$$\n\n(8)\n\nWhen we perform the following switch of the circular field helicities\n\\\\(\\left[{\\mathop{F}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{x}\\left(t\\right),{\\mathop{F}\\limits^{\n\\sim }}_{y}\\left(t\\right)\\right]\\to \\left[{\\mathop{F}\\limits^{ \\sim\n}}_{x}\\left(t\\right),-{\\mathop{F}\\limits^{ \\sim\n}}_{y}\\left(t\\right)\\right]\\\\),\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathop{{\\bf{F}}}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{\\circlearrowleft\n}(t)=[{F}_{\\omega }\\cos (\\omega t)+{F}_{2\\omega }\\cos (2\\omega t+\\varphi ),\\\\\\\n\\,\\,{F}_{\\omega }\\sin (\\omega t)-{F}_{2\\omega }\\sin (2\\omega t+\\varphi\n)]\\end{array}$$\n\n(9)\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathop{{\\bf{A}}}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{\\circlearrowleft\n}(t)=\\left[-\\frac{{F}_{\\omega }}{\\omega }\\sin (\\omega t)-\\frac{{F}_{2\\omega\n}}{2\\omega }\\sin (2\\omega t+\\varphi ),\\right.\\\\\\ \\,\\,\\left.\\frac{{F}_{\\omega\n}}{\\omega }\\cos (\\omega t)-\\frac{{F}_{2\\omega }}{2\\omega }\\cos (2\\omega\nt+\\varphi )\\right].\\end{array}$$\n\n(10)\n\nIn this case, \\\\({\\mathop{{\\bf{F}}}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{\\circlearrowright }\\\\)\nand \\\\({\\mathop{{\\bf{F}}}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{\\circlearrowleft }\\\\) maintain the\nsame spatial orientation, but the spatial orientation of the vector potential\n\\\\({\\mathop{{\\bf{A}}}\\limits^{ \\sim }}_{\\circlearrowright }\\\\) is rotated by\n180\u00b0 with respect to that of \\\\({\\mathop{{\\bf{A}}}\\limits^{ \\sim\n}}_{\\circlearrowleft }\\\\).\n\nRegardless of the definition of the bicircular field that we use, it is the\norientation of the vector potential relative to the crystal lattice (or\nBrillouin zone) that determines the band structure modification.\n\n#### Laser-induced CNNN hopping\n\nTo understand the physical mechanism governing the band modification and the\nconsequent valley polarization, we will use a two-orbital tight-binding model\nof gapped graphene, which captures the essential physics of the problem. The\ngapped-graphene lattice is the same as that of hBN, with one orbital per site.\nThose in sublattice A have on-site energy \\\\({E}_{{\\rm{A}}}\\\\) whereas those\nin sublattice B have on-site energy \\\\({E}_{{\\rm{B}}}\\\\). We will assume that,\nin the field-free state, next-nearest neighbour hoppings \\\\({\\gamma\n}^{({\\rm{NNN}})}\\\\) are negligible. However, upon interaction with the\nbicircular field, \\\\({\\gamma }^{({\\rm{NNN}})}\\\\) can be induced through\nvirtual nearest neighbour hoppings \\\\({\\gamma }^{({\\rm{NN}})}\\\\). We will\ncalculate this correction to lowest order in the field\u2013matter interaction. To\ndo so, note that a laser field modifies the nearest neighbour hopping between\nan orbital in sublattice A and an orbital in sublattice B according to the\nPeierls substitution,\n\n$${\\gamma }_{{\\rm{AB}}}^{\\left({\\rm{NN}}\\right)}\\left(t\\right)={\\gamma\n}_{1}{e}^{-{\\rm{i}}{{\\bf{r}}}_{{\\rm{AB}}}\\cdot {\\bf{A}}\\left(t\\right)},$$\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \\\\({\\gamma }_{1}\\\\) is the field-free nearest neighbour hopping,\n\\\\({{\\bf{r}}}_{{\\rm{AB}}}\\\\) is the distance from the site in sublattice B to\nthe site in sublattice A and \\\\({\\bf{A}}\\left(t\\right)\\\\) is the vector\npotential of the field. The laser-induced hopping term can be separated into\none cycle-averaged term and one term that contains the dynamical corrections\nto this cycle average:\n\n$${\\gamma }_{{\\rm{AB}}}^{\\left({\\rm{NN}}\\right)}\\left(t\\right)={\\gamma\n}_{1}\\langle {e}^{-{\\rm{i}}{{\\bf{r}}}_{{\\rm{AB}}}\\cdot\n{\\bf{A}}\\left(t\\right)}\\rangle +{V}_{{\\rm{AB}}}\\left(t\\right),$$\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \\\\(\\langle \\;\\rangle \\\\) means cycle-averaged. Therefore, we have\n\n$${V}_{{\\rm{AB}}}\\left(t\\right)={\\gamma\n}_{1}{e}^{-{\\rm{i}}{{\\bf{r}}}_{{\\rm{AB}}}\\cdot {\\bf{A}}\\left(t\\right)}-{\\gamma\n}_{1}\\langle {e}^{-{\\rm{i}}{{\\bf{r}}}_{{\\rm{AB}}}\\cdot\n{\\bf{A}}\\left(t\\right)}\\rangle .$$\n\n(13)\n\nThis perturbation can lead to transitions between next-nearest neighbours\n(\\\\({\\rm{A}}\\leftarrow {{\\rm{A}}}^{{\\prime} }\\\\)) of the same sublattice\nthrough virtual nearest neighbours. To lowest order, the transition amplitude\nfor such a second-order process reads (atomic units are used throughout)\n\n$${{\\mathcal{A}}}_{{\\rm{A}}\\leftarrow {A}^{{\\prime} }}^{(2)}(t)=-\\sum\n_{{\\rm{B}}}{\\int }_{{t}_{0}}^{t}{\\rm{d}}{t}^{{\\prime} }{\\int\n}_{{t}_{0}}^{{t}^{{\\prime} }}{\\rm{d}}{t}^{{\\prime\\prime}\n}{e}^{{\\rm{i}}({E}_{{\\rm{AB}}}{t}^{{\\prime} }+{E}_{{{\\rm{BA}}}^{{\\prime}\n}}{t}^{{\\prime\\prime} })}{V}_{{\\rm{AB}}}({t}^{{\\prime}\n}){V}_{{{\\rm{BA}}}^{{\\prime} }}({t}^{{\\prime\\prime} }),$$\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the energy difference\n\\\\({E}_{{\\rm{AB}}}={E}_{{\\rm{A}}}-{E}_{{\\rm{B}}}=\\varDelta \\\\), where\n\\\\(\\varDelta \\\\) is the minimum bandgap energy (we take \\\\({E}_{{\\rm{A}}} >\n{E}_{{\\rm{B}}}\\\\)). The summation in principle runs along all possible\nintermediate states in sublattice B. However, note that only one nearest\nneighbour site can participate. For example, looking at Extended Data Fig. 1,\nwe see that the transition from site A_-11 to site A_00 can happen only to\nfirst order through B_01. Therefore, we can drop the summation. Using equation\n(13):\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{{\\mathcal{A}}}_{{\\rm{A}}\\leftarrow {A}^{{\\prime}\n}}^{(2)}(t)=-{\\gamma }_{1}^{2}{\\int }_{{t}_{0}}^{t}{\\rm{d}}{t}^{{\\prime}\n}{{\\rm{e}}}^{i\\varDelta {t}^{{\\prime}\n}}\\left[{{\\rm{e}}}^{-{\\rm{i}}{{\\bf{r}}}_{{\\rm{AB}}}\\cdot\n{\\bf{A}}({t}^{{\\prime} })}-\\langle\n{{\\rm{e}}}^{-{\\rm{i}}{{\\bf{r}}}_{{\\rm{AB}}}\\cdot {\\bf{A}}(t)}\\rangle\n\\right]\\\\\\ \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,{\\int }_{{t}_{0}}^{{t}^{{\\prime}\n}}{\\rm{d}}{t}^{{\\prime\\prime} }{{\\rm{e}}}^{-{\\rm{i}}\\varDelta\n{t}^{{\\prime\\prime}\n}}\\left[{{\\rm{e}}}^{-{\\rm{i}}{{\\bf{r}}}_{{{\\rm{BA}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\cdot\n{\\bf{A}}({t}^{{\\prime\\prime} })}-\\langle\n{{\\rm{e}}}^{-{\\rm{i}}{{\\bf{r}}}_{{{\\rm{BA}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\cdot\n{\\bf{A}}(t)}\\rangle \\right].\\end{array}$$\n\n(15)\n\nWe perform a change of variables in the second integral,\n\\\\(u=-{\\rm{i}}\\left[\\varDelta {t}^{{\\prime\\prime}\n}+{{\\bf{r}}}_{{{\\rm{BA}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\cdot {\\bf{A}}\\left({t}^{{\\prime\\prime}\n}\\right)\\right]\\\\), so that \\\\({\\rm{d}}u=-{\\rm{i}}\\left[\\varDelta\n-{{\\bf{r}}}_{{{\\rm{BA}}}^{{\\prime} }}\\cdot {\\bf{F}}\\left({t}^{{\\prime\\prime}\n}\\right)\\right]\\,{\\rm{d}}{t}^{{\\prime\\prime} }\\\\). For moderately strong\nfields and large gap materials, as in this case, we have that\n\\\\(|{\\bf{F}}\\cdot {{\\bf{r}}}_{{\\rm{B}}{\\rm{A}}}|\\ll |\\varDelta |\\\\), so that\nwe can neglect the second term in \\\\({\\rm{d}}u\\\\) and write\n\\\\({\\rm{d}}u=-{\\rm{i}}\\varDelta \\,{\\rm{d}}{t}^{{\\prime\\prime} }\\\\).

Note\nthe following. First, the cycle-averaged, laser-induced, next-nearest\nneighbour, hoppings are complex whenever the vector potential is not pointing\ntowards the M direction. The imaginary component is a maximum when the vector\npotential points along K or K\u2032, and it switches sign between these two\norientations. Second, the hopping depends only on the orientation of the\nvector potential and not its sense of rotation (compare Extended Data Figs. 2b\nand 2d). The band structure is modified by rotating the vector potential,\nwhich can be achieved on a subcycle timescale by changing the two-colour phase\ndelay \\\\(\\varphi \\\\). Finally, also note that even when the vector potential\nis pointing towards the point M, the bandgap is reduced relative to the field-\nfree case due to a modification of the hopping. In this case, however, as the\nnext-nearest neighbour hopping is real, the gap is reduced equally in both\nvalleys.\n\n#### Numerical calculations\n\nWe performed time-dependent simulations of a tight model of gapped graphene\nusing the code described in ref. ^44. The field-free tight-binding parameters\nare \\\\({r}_{0}=2.73\\\\) a.u., \\\\(\\varDelta ={\\varDelta }_{{\\rm{A}}}-{\\varDelta\n}_{{\\rm{B}}}\\\\), where \\\\({\\varDelta }_{{\\rm{A}}}=5.9/2\\\\) eV and\n\\\\({\\varDelta }_{{\\rm{B}}}=-5.9/2\\\\) eV, and \\\\({\\gamma }_{1}=0.089\\\\) a.u.\nThe atomic distance and first neighbour hopping are taken to be like those of\ngraphene. Next-nearest neighbour hoppings and higher were neglected. Owing to\nthe uncertainty in the experimental intensity, we simulated several ratios and\nintensities of the bicircular (trefoil) field. The fields were simulated using\na Gaussian envelope with 30 fs of full-width at half-maximum for both fields,\nwhich matches the estimated duration of the fields in the experiment. The\ntime-dependent propagation was converged on a Monkhorst\u2013Pack k grid of 300 \u00d7\n300 points and a time step of 0.1 a.u. The dephasing time was set to 6 fs, but\ndifferent values did not change our results.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 2 shows the results for two different helicities of the\nbicircular field. In this case, the field parameters are \\\\({F}_{\\omega\n}=2{F}_{2\\omega }=0.0085\\\\) a.u., which correspond to an intensity in the\ncrystal of \\\\({I}_{\\omega }=2.5\\\\) TW cm^\u2212^2 and \\\\({I}_{2\\omega }=0.63\\\\) TW\ncm^\u2212^2. First, note that valley polarization does not change between Extended\nData Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2f, despite having switched the field\nhelicity. Second, the valley polarization switches in Extended Data Fig. 2c\nand Extended Data Fig. 2f upon a 60\u00b0 rotation of the bicircular field. Third,\nthere is a not a perfect interchange of the K and K\u2032 valley populations in\nExtended Data Fig. 2f,i. This is because the fields (or the associated vector\npotential) that give rise to the populations in Extended Data Fig. 2f,i are\nnot time-reversal partners. However, the fields in Extended Data Fig. 2c and\nExtended Data Fig. 2i do switch exactly the K and K\u2032 populations, since the\nfields in this case are time-reversal partners. Yet, it is clear that, for\nfixed helicity, the orientation of the field relative to the lattice controls\nthe valley polarization, even if the switching is not fully symmetric. This\neffect signals band modification by the strong bicircular field and allows for\nsubcycle control.\n\n### k-resolved populations\n\nExtended Data Fig. 3 shows the k-resolved populations after the interaction\nwith the bicircular field for different intensities using a fixed \u03c9 to 2\u03c9\nratio of 2:1 in intensity. We found similar results for intensity ratios of\n1:1, 4:1 and 6:1. The polarized valley always corresponds to that in which the\nmodel predicts that the bandgap is reduced. Also, the valley polarization\nincreases as a function of intensity, in accordance with the model prediction\nthat the effective bandgap decreases as the intensity is increased.\n\n### Probing the valley polarization\n\nTo transfer these valley populations into an optical degree of freedom that\ncan be measured in the experiment, we used a linearly polarized probe pulse\nafter the bicircular pulse which, as explained in the main text, allowed us to\nmap them into the helicity of its nonlinear harmonic response (H3 in this\ncase). As in the experiment, we used a probe light field of the same \u03c9\nfrequency as the fundamental field in the bicircular pulse. The field strength\nof the probe field was \\\\({F}_{\\text{probe}}=0.01\\\\) a.u., it was polarized\nalong the \u0393\u2013M direction (x direction in the figures) and its duration was 30\nfs of full-width at half-maximum. We tested different probe field strengths,\nbut these did not affect our results.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 4 shows the results of the polarimetry analysis. The two\nhelical components that the two photodiodes measure are defined as\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\widehat{e}}_{{\\rm{l}}}\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}({\\widehat{e}}_{x}+{\\rm{i}}{\\widehat{e}}_{y}),\\\\\\\n{\\widehat{e}}_{{\\rm{r}}}\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}({\\widehat{e}}_{x}-{\\rm{i}}{\\widehat{e}}_{y}).\\end{array}$$\n\n(22)\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\widehat{e}}_{{\\rm{l}}}\\,=\\,{\\left|\\frac{{A}_{x}}{\\sqrt{2}}{e}^{{\\rm{i}}{\\phi\n}_{x}}+\\frac{{A}_{y}}{\\sqrt{2}}{e}^{{\\rm{i}}({\\phi }_{y}+{\\rm{\\pi\n}}/2)}\\right|}^{2},\\\\\\\n{\\widehat{e}}_{{\\rm{r}}}\\,=\\,{\\left|\\frac{{A}_{x}}{\\sqrt{2}}{e}^{{\\rm{i}}{\\phi\n}_{x}}+\\frac{{A}_{y}}{\\sqrt{2}}{e}^{{\\rm{i}}({\\phi }_{y}-{\\rm{\\pi\n}}/2)}\\right|}^{2},\\end{array}$$\n\n(23)\n\nwhere A_x and A_y (\u03c6_x and \u03c6_y) are the Fourier amplitudes (phases) of the\nharmonic of interest of the probe (H3 in this case), along directions x and y,\nrespectively. We can rewrite the above as\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{\\widehat{e}}_{{\\rm{l}}}\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{2}| {A}_{x}| +\\frac{1}{2}| {A}_{y}| +| {A}_{x}| | {A}_{y}| \\cos ({\\phi }_{x}-{\\phi }_{y}-{\\rm{\\pi }}/2),\\\\\\ {\\widehat{e}}_{{\\rm{r}}}\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{2}| {A}_{x}| +\\frac{1}{2}| {A}_{y}| +| {A}_{x}| | {A}_{y}| \\cos ({\\phi }_{x}-{\\phi }_{y}+{\\rm{\\pi }}/2).\\end{array}$$\n\n(24)\n\nThe phase \u03c6_y changes by \u03c0 as the valley polarization changes sign since the y\ncomponent of the current comes from the anomalous contribution and, thus, is\nproportional to the Berry curvature, which has the same magnitude but opposite\nsign in both valleys. As the valley polarization changes upon rotation of the\nbicircular field, the interference (cosine) term in the expression above\noscillates sinusoidally, switching sign with a switch in valley polarization.\nAdditionally, the interference term of the two helicities oscillates out of\nphase because of the factor \u00b1\u03c0/2. Extended Data Fig. 4 shows the interference\nterm of the two helicity components, which indeed oscillate sinusoidally and\nout of phase. As expected, these interference terms are a maximum or a minimum\nwhen there is maximum valley polarization and zero when there is none. The\nasymmetry of these two interference terms completely characterizes the valley\npolarization.\n\nYet, the signal observed in the experiment also includes the amplitude term in\nthe equation above, \\\\(\\frac{1}{2}|{A}_{x}|+\\frac{1}{2}|{A}_{y}|\\\\), which\nalso oscillates. Its oscillation comes from unequal population injection as a\nfunction of rotation and other nonlinear effects occurring during the harmonic\ngeneration. However, this term is the same for both helicities, and thus, it\nis merely a background introducing higher-order Fourier components into the\noscillation. We plot this term in Extended Data Fig. 4.\n\nThe helicity signal is then the sum of the amplitude term, which is common to\nboth helicities, and the interference term, which is different for each\nhelicity and which contains the information on the valley polarization. The\ntotal left and right signals give, respectively, the red and green curves in\nExtended Data Fig. 4 and also in the main text, which is the curve to be\ncompared with the experiment.\n\nImportantly, regardless of the value of the amplitude term, since it is a\nbackground common to both helicities, we can remove its influence. For this,\nwe Fourier-filtered the oscillation to extract only the 120\u00b0 periodic\noscillation. In this way, the asymmetry of the two helicity signals after\nFourier filtering characterizes the valley polarization, with the change of\nsign indicating valley switching.\n\nNote that the helicity-resolved H3 probe signal as a function of the pump\ntrefoil rotation is essentially the same regardless of whether the probe is\npolarized along \u0393\u2013K or \u0393\u2013M (Extended Data Fig. 5).\n\n### Experimental details\n\n#### Laser system\n\nThe laser pulses used for the experiments were from a mid-infrared laser\nsystem based on optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification (OPCPA). The\ndetails are in ref. ^45. In brief, the laser for the mid-infrared OPCPA was\nfrom a 1 \u03bcm Innoslab Yb laser system. The pulses were used to generate the\nseed and the pump for the OPCPA. The OPCPA system produced pulses at 2.03 \u03bcm\ncentre wavelength with a 100 kHz repetition rate. During the experiment, the\naverage power obtained from the laser was 5.5\u20136 W with a pulse duration of\napproximately 25 fs. The pulse duration was carefully characterized using a\nfrequency-resolved optical gating^46 with a set-up developed in-house. The\nlaser pulses were characterized after they had passed through the\ninterferometer. To accurately determine the temporal characteristics of the\npulses used in the experiment, they were picked up right before they entered\nthe reflective objective of the microscope arrangement. A second-harmonic\ngeneration (SHG) frequency-resolved optical gating was used to characterize\nthe 1 \u03bcm pulses in a beta-barium borate crystal, whereas the 2 \u03bcm pulses were\ncharacterized by a surface third-harmonic generation frequency-resolved\noptical gating on glass (NBK7), both in a non-collinear geometry. The results\nof these measurements are shown below.\n\n#### Interferometer\n\nA large part of the experimental set-up was a three-arm Mach\u2013Zehnder\ninterferometer, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 6. Various aspects of the\ninterferometer are described in detail in the following sections.\n\n#### Pump\n\nThe 2 \u03bcm wavelength pulses from the laser source were fed directly into the\nthree-arm interferometer. First, the pulses were split in two by a 50\u201350 beam\nsplitter (red beam from right to left in Extended Data Fig. 6). The reflected\npart proceeded to the pump and the transmitted one to the probe arm. The pump\nbeam was sent through a 1.5-mm-thick lithium niobate (LiNbO_3) crystal (SHG)\ncut at 45.6\u00b0. This interaction produced a second pulse at half the wavelength\n(frequency of 2\u03c9) of the fundamental (frequency of \u03c9) by sum frequency\ngeneration (SHG)^47. LiNbO_3 is suited well for a 2 \u03bcm fundamental wavelength,\ngiven its wide transparency range in the mid-infrared of up to 3.5 \u03bcm. The\nphase-matching conditions (type 1) led to the second-harmonic component being\ncross-polarized with respect to the fundamental pulse^47. The co-propagating\ntwo-colour pulses (\u03c9 and 2\u03c9) were separated using a custom-designed dichroic\nbeam splitter. The \u03c9 arm passed through a variable neutral-density filter, a\nretro-reflection stage and CaF_2 as used in the probe arm, but without the\npiezo motion rails, as the length of this arm was fixed with respect to the\nother arms. Additionally, a wire grid polarizer was placed in its path to\nclean its polarization state before it combined with the 2\u03c9 arm at another\ndichroic beam splitter. The 2\u03c9 arm was reflected off the first dichroic beam\nsplitter at 90\u00b0 and traversed the exact same arrangement as the \u03c9 arm. The\nonly difference was a different pair of custom chirped mirrors for 2\u03c9 on the\ndelay stage above a closed-loop stick\u2013slip piezo nano-positioning rail with a\npositioning resolution of 1 nm, a different amount of dispersion-compensating\nmaterial and a perpendicular axis set on the polarizer. The pump arm (co-\npropagating \u03c9 and 2\u03c9) was further sent through a long-pass spectral filter\n(F1) to block the parametric optical signals generated at the harmonics of the\ntwo-colour pump in the LiNbO_3 crystal. Finally, the two-colour pump (\u03c9 and\n2\u03c9) pulses passed through the fused-silica wedged pair to recombine with the\nprobe pulses (\u03c9), which were reflected off it.\n\nAfter the three-arm interferometer, the laser beam was expanded using a\nreflective telescope arrangement to roughly match the input diameter of the\ntight-focusing reflective objective and adjust the beam divergence. However,\nright before the focusing objective, there was a broadband quarter-wave plate\n(\u03bb/4) with its optical axis at 45\u00b0 with respect to the cross-polarized axis of\nthe two-colour pump. This wave plate arrangement transformed the linear,\ncross-polarized, pump pulses into circularly polarized, counter-rotating\npulses that look like a trefoil or a three-leaf pulse in the X\u2013Y plane, as\nrequired in the experiment. The quarter-wave plate was intentionally placed\nright before the focusing element to prevent any changes in ellipticity due to\na phase shift between the s- and p-polarized components upon reflection,\nespecially from beam-folding mirrors and other coated optical elements. For\nthe \u03c9 and 2\u03c9 pump components, the pulse durations measured just before the\nfocusing objective were about 26 and 48 fs, respectively. Extended Data Fig. 7\ndepicts the spectral and temporal characteristics of the \u03c9 and 2\u03c9 pump\ncomponents. A similar kind of waveform synthesizer was also used earlier in\nattosecond-controlled strong-field experiments by the group^36. The data shown\nin the manuscript were obtained with the pump intensity in the range 4\u20137 TW\ncm^\u2212^2. For the intensity scaling measurements, the overall power of the pump\nbeam was changed with a variable neutral-density filter keeping the relative\npower ratio between the components intact.\n\n#### Probe\n\nIn the probe arm, the pulses went through a variable neutral-density filter\nfollowed by a delay stage, which, along with a pair of silver retro-reflecting\nmirrors, hosted two customized chirped mirrors for simultaneous positive\ndispersion and spectral filtering. Spectral filtering is crucial given the\nexistence of weak optical signals at lower wavelengths arising from the\nparametric processes in various crystals in the laser system. The delay stage\nwas mounted on a closed-loop stick\u2013slip piezo rail (Smaract SLC-24 series)\nwith a positioning resolution of 1 nm. Further down, the pulses went through a\ndefined thickness of material (CaF_2) to compensate for excess positive\ndispersion. Additionally, another long-pass spectral filter was placed in the\nbeam path to further suppress the unwanted optical signals at lower\nwavelengths. Finally, the probe pulses went through a half-wave (\u03bb/2) plate\nand a quarter-wave (\u03bb/4) plate, after which they were reflected off the wedge\nplate and recombined with the pump beam. This wave-plate combination allowed\nus to control the polarization state of the probe pulses, and the mechanism is\ndescribed in greater detail later. This wedge pair arrangement not only acted\nas a beam recombination element but also as a power attenuator for the probe\npulses, as only 4% of the power was reflected. After being recombined, the\nprobe beam followed the collinear path with the pump beam. Just before the\nfocusing objective, a pulse duration of about 26 fs was achieved for the probe\npulses.\n\nAs shown in Extended Data Fig. 6, a \u03bb/4 plate was the last optical element\nbefore the pulses entered the reflective objective. This led to a major\nproblem in which the third arm (or the linearly polarized probe as in this\nexperiment) cannot remain linear once it has passed through the \u03bb/4 plate\nunless it is along the optical axis at 45\u00b0. Also, a linear polarization\nlaunched at 45\u00b0 with respect to the s- or p-polarized states would lose its\nlinear contrast, as it would become elliptical on acquiring a different phase\nshift in the s and p components on every reflective optic in its beam path. To\nhave full flexibility over the polarization state of the probe pulses after\nthe \u03bb/4 plate, a scheme was implemented such that a combination of \u03bb/2 and \u03bb/4\nwave plates were additionally placed in the probe arm, as depicted in Extended\nData Fig. 6. Intuitively, one can think of these additional plates as inducing\nperfectly opposing elliptical polarization, which cancels out in the final \u03bb/4\nbefore the reflective objective to produce linearly polarized light with a\nhigh extinction ratio. This scheme was numerically tested using a Jones matrix\napproach. It was observed that any arbitrary shifts in phase between the s and\np components in the beam path between the two \u03bb/4 wave plates can be\ncompensated. However, changes in magnitude between the s and p components lead\nto a deviation from linearity and cannot be compensated for by this scheme.\n\nA movable silver mirror was placed at 45\u00b0 right before the reflective\nobjective intercepting the probe pulses to optimize and characterize the\npolarization extinction ratio or linearity. The pulses were then guided to an\nInGaAs photodiode with a polarizer attached to it at a fixed angle. The fixed\nangle was such that the probe polarization was aligned along s or p to prevent\nany additional ellipticity induced by the intercepting mirror, which would not\nbe present otherwise during the experiment.\n\nThe data shown in the main manuscript were obtained at a pump\u2013probe delay of\nabout 60\u2013110 fs.\n\n### Trefoil pump rotation\n\nWhen the bicircular \u03c9 and 2\u03c9 components of the pump were combined in the\ninterferometer such that the E field ratio at the focus was 2:1, the coherent\nsum of their electric fields in the X\u2013Y plane (the plane perpendicular to\npropagation) was transformed to that of a trefoil waveform. The rotation of\nthe trefoil waveform was controlled by the subcycle phase delay between the \u03c9\nand 2\u03c9 components. Experimentally, this was achieved by introducing an optical\npath difference between the \u03c9 and 2\u03c9 arms. When the central wavelength (\u03bb_0)\nof the \u03c9 arm was 2 \u03bcm, a rotation of 360\u00b0 was induced by delaying the piezo\nstage by 3 \u03bcm. This information was used to convert the stage delay to angular\nrotation, which was recorded as the experimental data.\n\n### Interferometric stability\n\nDuring the experiment, it was critical that the angle of the three-leaf or\ntrefoil pump remained stable, as this was directly linked to the delay between\nthe two colours in the pump arm. To characterize the delay stability, an\nadditional temperature-stabilized continuous-wave diode laser (Thorlabs\nL785P090 with LDMT9) was sent through the two pump arms to interferometrically\nmeasure its path difference over time.\n\nUsing the above-mentioned scheme, the interferometric stability was found to\nbe highest around 2 h after switching on the driving laser system.\nAdditionally, tests were carried out to measure the stability when the laser\nwas going through the interferometer and the piezo delay stage being scanned,\nas during the experiment, as illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 8. Over a\nperiod of 10 min, the standard deviation of the position generated by the\nclosed-loop piezo stages from the position extracted from the continuous-wave\ninterferometer was close to 38.1 nm, which roughly translates to about 4.6\u00b0 in\nrotation error of the \u03c9 and 2\u03c9 bicircular trefoil structure. A similar scheme\nwith active stabilization was used earlier and achieved few tens of attosecond\ninterferometric stability^48.\n\n### Microscope\n\nThe core segment of the microscope (Extended Data Fig. 9) applied tight\nfocusing of laser pulses from all three interferometer arms, followed by a\ncollection and collimation configuration before the light proceeded to the\ndetection apparatus. A 500-\u03bcm-thick fused-silica substrate with the hBN\nmonolayer on its front surface was placed between these components.\n\nThe focusing was achieved without adding any dispersion or chromatic\naberration by using a reflective objective with a numerical aperture of 0.4.\nThe beam profile in the interaction region was characterized by placing a CMOS\nsensor in the focal plane. A cross section of the resulting two-dimensional\nsignal on the sensor is shown in Extended Data Fig. 10 for all three\ninterferometer arms. The beam waists extracted from the fit were about 8.0,\n10.0 and 9.7 \u03bcm for the 2\u03c9 pump, \u03c9 pump and \u03c9 probe arms, respectively. The\nbeam was largely circular at the focus, and the residual ellipticity was below\n5% for each arm. The small focus spot sizes not only allowed us to spatially\nrestrict the laser interaction to a single hBN monocrystalline grain but also\ngave a Rayleigh length (201 \u03bcm for 2\u03c9 and 157 \u03bcm for \u03c9) that was significantly\nless than the thickness of the fused-silica substrate (Extended Data Fig. 9).\nBy observing the surface-enhanced perturbative harmonics, we could\nindividually optimize the substrate position (back or front of the hBN-coated\nsurfaces) at the focus.\n\nOnce the fused-silica substrate was at the focus, the diverging beam along\nwith other nonlinear signals was recollimated using a long-working-distance\ntransmissive objective with a numerical aperture of 0.45. Using a closely\nmatched numerical aperture allowed the divergent beams to be entirely\ncollected.\n\nFurther down, the laser pulses were polarization resolved using a quartz\nWollaston prism. The prism introduced an angular separation of 10\u00b0 between the\np- and s-polarized components, which were then loosely focused by a CaF_2 lens\nonto the two separate large-area photodiodes. A \u03bb/4 wave plate was placed\nbetween the transmission objective and the Wollaston prism with its optical\naxis at 45\u00b0 with respect to the prism to convert the photodiodes into helicity\ndetectors.\n\n### Spatio-temporal overlap\n\nAs described earlier, the implementation of a three-arm interferometer leads\nto the laser pulses travelling through three different non-collinear optical\npaths. Upon recombination, they require careful alignment such that they\nspatially and temporally overlap in the interaction region. To ensure this,\nthe second-order and third-order nonlinearity in fused silica is utilized such\nthat a two- and three-photon transition of \u03c9 and 2\u03c9 leads to the production of\n3\u03c9 and 4\u03c9 photons, respectively. To utilize this effect, the 2\u03c9 pump is chosen\nas a common reference and the other pulses are aligned onto this particular\narm. An initial spatial alignment of all three arms using irises is enough to\nensure a coarse spatial overlap between the pulses at the focus on the fused-\nsilica substrate. Soon after, the 2\u03c9 pump arm is delayed with respect to the \u03c9\npump arm while observing the 4\u03c9 light with an appropriate band-pass filter\nbefore the photodiodes. As the pump arms are counter-rotating bicircularly in\ntheir polarization state with respect to each other, the 3\u03c9 channel is\ndisallowed. After the 2\u03c9 pump delay is fixed, its delay with respect to the\nprobe arm is determined by scanning the probe delay stage and observing the 3\u03c9\nor 4\u03c9 channels, as both these transitions are allowed. After the temporal\nalignment, the spatial overlap is checked and optimized based on the\nrespective parametric signals.\n\n### Lock-in polarization detection\n\nIn this experiment, the signal of interest is the 3\u03c9 harmonic generated by the\nprobe and modulated by the pump. However, several sources of light are co-\npropagating along with the signal and impinging on the diodes. Hence, a simple\namplified detection of the diode current is not enough to distinguish the\nrelevant 3\u03c9 signal (\u03bb \u2248 667 nm). Signals that are spectrally different are\nalready filtered using high- or low-pass spectral filters, which block the\nfundamental 2\u03c9, components above \u03bb = 750 nm and other components below \u03bb = 600\nnm. However, 3\u03c9 light can be produced by the pump (\u03c9) and probe (\u03c9) pulses\nindividually by the third-harmonic upconversion process and by the combination\nof pump (2\u03c9) and probe (\u03c9) through a two-photon process on the silica\nsubstrate, thereby further polluting the experimental signal of interest.\n\nWe overcome this major problem by modulating either the \u03c9 arm or the 2\u03c9 arm of\nthe interferometer using a mechanical chopper wheel with a 50% duty cycle at a\nknown frequency. Hence, the 3\u03c9 signal of interest, which was probed by a\nmodulated bicircular pump, was also modulated at the chopping frequency. To\nchop the \u03c9 arm, an unwanted 3\u03c9 signal, generated by the third-harmonic\nupconversion of \u03c9 pump, falls entirely on a single diode (D1) because its\nhelicity remains the same as that of the \u03c9 pump. Therefore, the other diode\n(D2) remains background-free. Moreover, when the 2\u03c9 arm is chopped, an\nunwanted 3\u03c9 signal, generated through a pump (2\u03c9) and probe (\u03c9) two-photon\nprocess, falls on the D2 diode, as its helicity is the same as that of the 2\u03c9\nsignal. In that case, the D1 diode remains background-free. Therefore, a\ncombination of two independent measurements while keeping all the parameters\nunchanged, first chopping the \u03c9 arm and subsequently the 2\u03c9 arm, can fulfil\nthe requirement for detecting both the helicities of the 3\u03c9 signal in a\nbackground-free condition. Note that the continuous service of the continuous-\nwave reference interferometer ensures the interferometric stability between\nthese two measurements. This modulated signal impinging on the photodiodes is\namplified by two high-gain, low-noise, trans-impedance amplifiers placed right\nbehind the respective photodiodes to minimize the noise picked up by the\ncables. The amplified voltage signals are then fed into two time-synchronized\nlock-in amplifiers (Zurich Instruments).\n\nExtended Data Table 1 lists the signals detected along with their origin. It\nalso depicts the method by which the background signals are rejected while\nkeeping the relevant signal detectable.\n\n### hBN monolayer sample\n\nThe hBN monolayer samples used in this experiment were obtained from a\ncommercial supplier (ACS Materials). These were grown using chemical vapour\ndeposition and subsequently transferred onto a 500-\u03bcm-thick, large-area (5 cm\ndiameter), fused-silica substrate. Although the monolayer patches, of\ncharacteristic size of about 10 \u03bcm as typical for samples grown by chemical\nvapour deposition, had their large areas covered, their orientations were\nrandom. These individual hBN patches were characterized in situ by microscopy.\n\n### SHG polarization-resolved microscopy\n\nTo characterize the quality of the hBN patches individually, we used in situ\npolarization-resolved SHG microscopy. This was repeated before every\nexperimental run.\n\nSHG polarization-resolved microscopy was done with the 1 \u03bcm wavelength arm of\nthe set-up. The perturbative second harmonic was detected by a photodiode or\nspectrometer after being collected by the transmission objective and passed\nthrough band-pass filters and eventually a polarizer. The SHG is not only the\nstrongest component but being an even harmonic, it is a pure indicator of\nbroken inversion symmetry in a crystal. Hence, the emission was also fully\nabsent from the fused-silica surface, leaving only odd layers of hBN (1L, 3L,\n5L, ..., (2n + 1)L), which break inversion symmetry to produce SHG. As n\nincreases, the magnitude of SHG drops^49,50. Hence, a spatial scan over the\nsubstrate with the SHG strength as an optimization parameter can locate the\nthinner odd layers of hBN.\n\nAnother important advantage of this technique is that it can be performed in\nsitu during the final band engineering experiment to make sure that all three\nprobe and bicircular pump pulses also excite the same hBN grain as\nindependently observed by this characterization technique.\n\nFurther, not only can this technique determine the inversion-symmetry breaking\nbut it can also detect the orientation of the hBN crystals by observing the\npolarization response of the material. The two unique light-induced\noscillation directions (armchair and zigzag) make the outgoing SHG\npolarization rotate in the opposite direction and at twice the rate, as a\nfunction of the rotation of the incoming (pump) light polarization. This has\nalso been widely investigated and demonstrated in recent works^49,50. Two\nresults from two different positions on the hBN sample used are displayed in\nExtended Data Fig. 11. The characteristic four-lobe polarization-dependent\nsignal implies that the interaction region of the laser irradiation is small\nenough to fit into the monocrystalline hBN patch. Thus, the single crystalline\norientation is dominant and is not averaged out over several grains with\ndifferent crystalline orientations. Further, Extended Data Fig. 11a,b shows\nthat the four-lobe structure exhibits an angular offset with the four-lobe\nstructure obtained from a neighbouring hBN patch. This manifests from the hBN\ncrystalline patches, which are oriented at arbitrary angles at different laser\nexcitation sites. Usually, a six-lobe feature in the SHG signals can be used\nto indicate the orientation of hBN (ref. ^49). This difference is attributed\nto a lab-to-incident polarization frame conversion. In the present case, the\nSHG polarization microscopy was done in transmission mode while keeping the\nsample fixed for a given hBN patch. The sensitivity of this technique to the\npresence of hBN on the fused-silica substrate allows it to be used as a marker\nfor laser-induced damage. This confirms that the suitable intensity range\nbefore damage occurs is close to 10^13 W cm^\u2212^2 .\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the\ncorresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n## Code availability\n\nThe parts of the numerical code used for the simulations contained in this\nstudy is available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.\nDetails of the numerical code can be found in ref. ^44.\n\n## References\n\n  1.

Each atom\nA_nm is labelled by its sub-lattice (A or B) and by its lattice vector\n\\\\({{\\boldsymbol{R}}}_{{nm}}=n{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}_{1}+m{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}_{2}\\\\).\nIn Eq. 2, the angle \u03b1 between two atoms is defined according to the inset in\nthe top left. b, First Brillouin zone of monolayer hBN and its high-symmetry\npoints.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 2 Laser-induced Haldane-type hoppings and band\nstructure modification.\n\na,d,g, Examples of \\\\(\\langle {\\gamma }_{{AA}^{{\\prime} }}^{({NNN})}\\rangle\n\\\\) (red) and \\\\(\\langle {\\gamma }_{{BB}^{{\\prime} }}^{({NNN})}\\rangle \\\\)\n(blue) for different vector potentials. The green curve shows the electric\nfield orientation and the arrow shows the sense of rotation of the field.\nb,e,h, The purple curve shows the vector potential that results from the\nelectric field on the left panel, with the arrow showing its sense of\nrotation. The red circles show the valley at which the band gap is reduced\naccording to the analytical model. c,f,i, k-resolved populations obtained from\na time-dependent simulation of a tight binding model of gapped graphene using\nthe electric field and vector potential in the corresponding left panels (I_\u03c9\n= 2.5 TW/cm^2, I_2\u03c9 = 0.63 TW/cm^2, and frequency \u03c9 = 0.6 eV).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 3 k-resolved populations for different pump\nintensities.\n\nNormalized electron populations after the pump bicircular field for several\norientations and pump intensities. The \u03c9 to 2\u03c9 intensity ratio is kept fixed\nat 2:1. a\u2013d, I_\u03c9 = 2 TW/cm^2; e\u2013h, I_\u03c9 = 4 TW/cm^2; i\u2013l, I_\u03c9 = 6 TW/cm^2; m\u2013p,\nI_\u03c9 = 8 TW/cm^2; q\u2013t, I_\u03c9 = 10 TW/cm^2. Each of the four columns corresponds\nto a different orientation of the vector potential relative to the Brillouin\nzone hexagon, which is shown at the top.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 4 Probing of the valley polarization via optical\npolarimetry.\n\nLeft (red, counter-rotating with the fundamental \u03c9 field of the pump) and\nright (green, co-rotating with the fundamental \u03c9 field of the pump) helicities\nof the third harmonic of a linearly-polarized probe field. The different rows\ncorrespond to different intensities of the pump field keeping the \u03c9 to 2\u03c9\nintensity ratio is kept fixed at 2:1 (same as those in Extended Data Fig. 3):\na\u2013c, I_\u03c9 = 2 TW/cm^2; d\u2013f, I_\u03c9 = 4 TW/cm^2; g\u2013i, I_\u03c9 = 6 TW/cm^2; j\u2013l, I_\u03c9 = 8\nTW/cm^2; m\u2013o, I_\u03c9 = 10 TW/cm^2. The probe polarization is oriented along\n\\\\(\\varGamma -M\\\\). The left column corresponds to the amplitude and\ninterference signals, as discussed in Methods 1.4.2, computed at the frequency\npoint \u03bd = 3\u03c9. The middle column shows the left and right helicity signals\ncomputed from the integral of the H3 signal, as measured in the experiment.\nThe right-most column shows the Fourier components of the oscillation in the\ncorresponding middle column panel.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 5 Dependence of helicity-resolved H3 on probe\npolarization direction.\n\nResults for the helicity-resolved H3 probe signal as a function of the two-\ncolour phase delay \u03c6 (that is, pump trefoil rotation) when the probe field is\npolarized along the (a) \\\\(\\varGamma -K\\\\) and (b) \\\\(\\varGamma -M\\\\)\ndirection. The intensity of the pump field is 2 TW/cm^2.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 6 Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometric setup.\n\nThe acronyms of the components have the following meaning: WP, Wollaston\nprism; F1, long pass filter; F2, short pass filter; F3, l ong pass filter; PD,\nphotodiode; TIA, trans-impedance amplifier; BS, beam splitter; DBS, dichroic\nbeam splitter; Pol., polarizer; WeP, wedged pair; CM, chirped mirrors; SHG,\nsecond harmonic generation LiNbO_3 crystal; CW, continuous wave laser; LIA,\nlock-in amplifier. A detailed description of the setup is provided in the\ntext.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 7 Spectral and temporal properties of the \u03c9 \u2212 2\u03c9\ntrefoil pump pulses.\n\nSubplot a shows the measured laser spectra recorded after the interferometer,\nright before the focusing objective to give an accurate representation of the\nlaser pulses used. The laser pulses are picked off from the same region for\nfrequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) retrieval. The retrieved spectra and\ntemporal profile along with their phases are shown in subplots b,c,\nrespectively. It suggests the pulse durations of about 26.1 and 48.0 fs for \u03c9\nand 2\u03c9, respectively.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 8 Interferometric stability of the pump arms.\n\nThe relative displacement between the \u03c9 \u2212 2\u03c9 pump arms is recorded while a\npiezo closed-loop stage controlling the displacement is swept over a period of\nten minutes. The position read out by the stage is compared to that extracted\nfrom an additional CW interferometer to estimate the error in displacement\nmapping. A standard deviation in drift of 38.1 nm corresponds to an angular\njitter of 4.6\u00b0 in the trefoil pump structure.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 9 Schematic representation of the microscope\narrangement.\n\nA reflective objective with NA: 0.4 was used to expose isolated hBN monolayer\ngrains, coated on the front (left) surface of 500 \u03bcm thick fusJed silica\nsubstrate, with tailored laser pulses. On the output side a transmission\nobjective of NA: 0.45 was used. This focusing configuration results in a focal\nspot size (w_o) of about 10.0 \u03bcm and Rayleigh length (Z_R) below 157 \u03bcm for 2\n\u03bcm wavelength pump component. For 1 \u03bcm wavelength pump component these numbers\nare 8.0 \u03bcm and 201 \u03bcm, respectively. See Extended Data Fig. 9 for the\nexperimental data.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 10 Beam profile cross-section.\n\nThe beam profiles of three interferometer arms were measured at the focal\nplane of the objective on a CMOS detector. The wavelength of 2\u03c9 arm results in\na single-photon response (SPR), whereas the other two arms produce a two-\nphoton response on the detector given the band gap of silicon. To determine\nthe waist (\u03c9_0), this was considered producing the orange and purple curves\nfor the 2 \u03bcm cases.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 11 Polarization resolved SHG from hBN.\n\nThe rotation of SHG as a function of the polarization rotation of a linearly\npolarized pump pulse is illustrated here. The intensity of the SHG\n(normalized) is mapped after passing through a polarizer/Wollaston prism for\nfew-odd-layer hBN patch site 1 in subplot a and patch site 2 in subplot b on a\nfused silica substrate. The fit function used is Y_fit = A cos (\u22122\u03b8 + \u03c6)^2,\nwhere A is the amplitude of the oscillation and \u03b8 is the angle of the incoming\npump polarization.\n\nExtended Data Table 1 List of signals picked up by the photo-detector\n\nFull size table\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n### Supplementary Data\n\nThis zipped file contains source data files for Supplementary Figs. 1\u20134 and\nExtended Data Figs 2\u20135, 7, 8, 11 and 10.\n\n### Peer Review File\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
