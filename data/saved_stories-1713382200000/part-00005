A significant chunk of the Foundation's even-then\nmodest budget came from that, and when this blew up, it put the entire\nfinancial structure of Mozilla as a not-beholden-to-shareholders, privately-\nheld-by-a-not-for-profit entity at risk.\n\n20h *\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\nAfter what I'm told was a few days of very difficult negotiation under\nextraordinary pressure, both internal and external, a deal was struck. The\nplan was that Eich make an announcement, apologizing for his \"mistake\" and\nmaking some public-benefit commitment about inclusivity, importance of\ndiversity, etc.\n\nHalf the board resigned.\n\nBut he takes his public drubbing, apologizes and gets his company. The\nstructure of the organization survives, the mission lives.\n\nAt the last minute, he reneged.\n\n20h *\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\nNow, I have some feelings, still today, about that situation. That bullshit\ngraph he's aired out about Mitchell's salary versus market share carefully\nomits the fact that he was CTO for most of that time, presiding over a long\nperiod of technical stagnation and market decline, and had never directly\nmanaged more than a handful of people in his career. It wasn't until years\nlater under new leadership with Firefox 57, the Quantum release, that Firefox\nbecame performance-competitive again.\n\n20h *\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\nBut the real reason wasn't that he made a donation to some reprehensible\ncause.\n\nThe real reason he lost his job was because he showed everyone who mattered\nthat when the chips were down - and I mean, 100%, the whole table is all the\nway in, down - that he'd put his own pride or vanity or who gives a fuck what\nahead of the continued existence of the company and the mission.\n\nHe lost his job because he made a bet that he was more important than the\npossible end of Mozilla and he lost that bet.\n\n20h *\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\nWhen he later announcing his resignation as Firefox module owner and\nmentioning Brave, he sent mozilla.governance email about how he'd compared\nother engines to Gecko on all sorts of axes and how Electron/Chromium was\nsuperior on all of them, and I can still remember staring at my reply, at the\nwords \"if only we'd had somebody at Mozilla for the last fifteen years, in\nsome sort of technical leadership capacity, who might have been able to do\nsomething about that. Too much to wish for, I guess\".\n\n20h\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\nAnd one of the few regrets of my time there was that I stared at what I'd\nwritten for ten minutes before deciding not to, and deleting it.\n\n19h *\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\nAnyway, after getting laughed off the internet for that goofy manifesto of his\nI'm sure Marca is airing this out now because he'd like to imagine himself\nalso part of some great-man-pulled-down narrative; it's a common affliction\namong people with so much money they can't feel anything but petulantly-\nunderworshipped anymore and zero useful ideas to speak of.\n\nBut that story is bullshit.\n\n17h\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\n(This originally read company-wide, not mozilla.governance, and webkit, not\nchromium. My mistake, I've corrected those details.)\n\n20h\n\nBen Rosengart @fivetonsflax@tilde.zone\n\n@mhoye Do you remember how you phrased it? Snarky or earnest?\n\n20h\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\n@fivetonsflax Nearly verbatim that.\n\n17h\n\nBruce Elrick @virtuous_sloth@cosocial.ca\n\n@mhoye @fivetonsflax The \"if only we had...\" sarcastic/facetious rhetorical\nstyle is one I used often in work meetings across a number of employers and\ncustomers as a way of connecting and commiserating with like-minded colleagues\nabout the disconnect between intention and execution. My colleagues would\nbegin to anticipate what I might say in similar situations.\n\n17h *\n\nBruce Elrick @virtuous_sloth@cosocial.ca\n\n@mhoye @fivetonsflax They noticed I only said it in the situation where we had\n*exactly* the thing I was lamenting not having.\n\n\"If only we had some sort of system to track...X\" was a regular one in ITIL\nX-management meetings for X in issue, problem, service, change...etc. it\nseemed to correlate with cargo-cult X-management.\n\n19h\n\nMr. Completely @mrcompletely@heads.social\n\n@mhoye beware the man who had one highly acclaimed accomplishment early in his\ncareer\n\n17h\n\nDonald Ball @donaldball@triangletoot.party\n\n@mrcompletely @mhoye I have some different words to offer that may better\ndescribe Javascript.\n\n8h\n\nTane Piper @tanepiper@tane.codes\n\n@mrcompletely @mhoye One that the rest of us have to suffer with ever since.\n\n7h\n\nYoan @greut@swiss.social\n\n@mrcompletely @mhoye the also called Nobelitis.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_disease\n\nen.m.wikipedia.orgNobel disease - Wikipedia\n\n6h\n\nReid @Reiddragon@fedi.reimu.info\n\n@mrcompletely @mhoye doubly so when his one accomplishment was making a\nprogramming language in a weekend while very likely drunk, and that language\nis JavaScript\n\n19h\n\nmav @mav@hackers.town\n\n@mhoye I am increasingly unsurprised he went on to found a browser that's some\nkind of weird arrangement of crypto grift and literally stealing ad revenue\n\n19h\n\nmav @mav@hackers.town\n\n@mhoye also this seems to be as much of a good time as any to remind everyone\nthat Marc Andreesen is also an entire waste of space\n\n18h\n\ndatarama @datarama@hachyderm.io\n\n@mav @mhoye Marc Andreessen apparently likes to more or less regularly remind\nus of that himself.\n\n15h\n\nJannis Leidel @jezdez@publicidentity.net\n\n@mhoye Thank you\n\n2h\n\nIan McCullough @bookscout\n\n@mhoye me in my academic library meetings \u201cIf only there was a field we could\nconsult that specialized in organizing information....\u201d\n\n18h\n\nAsta [AMP] @aud@fire.asta.lgbt\n\n@mhoye@mastodon.social mannnnnnn, Eich literally burned himself on his last\nemail to the company?

I don't remember receiving it, but\nwhat I'm sure is that the first versions of Brave were actually Gecko-based\n(using browser.html as the frontend), then Electron then Chromium, but never\nWebKit.\n\nAbout Firefox becoming competitive only with Quantum... man, it was so cringe\nat the time to see the desktop team rediscovering what we learned from the\nwork on b2g (both UI and platform) and that the desktop team fought so much\nagainst at the time.\n\n18h *\n\nMike Conley (:mconley) @mconley@mozilla.social\n\n@fabrice @mhoye\n\n> and that the desktop team fought so much against at the time.\n\nCitation needed? Desktop had _no resources_. (Almost) everybody was working on\nb2g. We were begging for scraps of people's cycles to work on our flagship\nproduct.\n\n18h\n\nFabrice Desr\u00e9 @fabrice@fosstodon.org\n\n@mconley @mhoye That's not true. Who from the desktop team was pulled into\nb2g? Your \"flagship\" still has no good distribution channel and is losing\nusers, not just market share. That won't be fixed by making it a better\nproduct unfortunately because *users are somewhere else*.\n\nKilling b2g after only shipping it for 2.5 years was so stupid for all of Moz,\nincluding Desktop.\n\n(disclaimer: Fx Nightly is my default browser).\n\n18h\n\nMike Conley (:mconley) @mconley@mozilla.social\n\n@fabrice @mhoye\n\nFront-end engineers were being yanked in to work on Gaia. The entire Graphics\nteam was so focused on b2g that the Australis re-theme was delayed by _months_\nso we could work through graphics performance issues with them. You have no\nidea what it was like to work on desktop during those years.\n\nI know you're bitter about b2g at Moz, but it happened. Take the L. Move on.\n\nDisclaimer: I used a reference FxOS phone for a year as my primary.\n\n18h\n\nFabrice Desr\u00e9 @fabrice@fosstodon.org\n\n@mconley @mhoye I'm bitter about people defending Baker/Mayo/Bryant blindly\nwithout realizing how much damage they did, yes. Had they honored their word\nto keep it as a community project / Tier3, they could have reaped the India\nmarket a mere 2 years later.\n\nComplaining about months of delay on gfx is ridiculous in the grand scheme of\nthings, and you know it.\n\n17h\n\nKevin Brosnan @kbrosnan\n\n@fabrice @mconley @mhoye\n\nFrom the 1.0 push up through the disastrous Florida all-hands the majority of\nengineering resources were dedicated to b2g projects.\n\nMy team of about 8 was down to 1 person each working on Firefox for Android\nand Firefox iOS. Even then myself and Aaron would be pulled into b2g testing\nfor weeks at a time.\n\nSimilar sort of story for our contracting team.\n\n17h\n\nKevin Brosnan @kbrosnan\n\n@fabrice @mconley @mhoye\n\nThe way Mozilla treated the project post Florida is something to be angry\nabout but the time period mconley and I are talking about was the height of\nb2g development.\n\n7h\n\nGabriele Svelto @gabrielesvelto@fosstodon.org\n\n@kbrosnan @fabrice @mhoye I remember sitting in a meeting with Mark Mayo with\na graph showing us that 40% of Mozilla's resources were dedicated to b2g at\nits peak. The picture you and @mconley are painting sounds more like 90%.\nEither way this means that top management was completely out-of-the-loop both\nwith regards to b2g and desktop.\n\nI've always attributed our failure to mismanagement and now I'm even more\nconvinced of that.\n\n4h\n\nBen Francis @benfrancis\n\n@gabrielesvelto @kbrosnan @fabrice @mhoye @mconley\n\nI realise this thread has strayed way off its original topic, but... hot take:\n\nMozilla should bring back Firefox OS.\n\nPutting decade-old company politics aside it was the most innovative and\npotentially disruptive thing Mozilla ever built, before and since, and is\nneeded now more than ever.\n\nFor smartphones maybe, but also all manner of other smart devices where owning\nthe OS is the only effective way to disrupt the incumbents.\n\n1h\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\n@benfrancis @gabrielesvelto @kbrosnan @fabrice @mconley\n\nCounterpoint: FirefoxOS was a misguided project cancelled far too late. It had\nno shot, and its principal utility was letting phone OEMs get an extra two\nyears out of existing product lines at the low end. CPU performance curves\nmade investing a ton of effort to make things work on the low end something\nthat Apple could ignore entirely and Android could wait out, changing nothing.\n\n1h\n\nDale Harvey @dale@toot.cafe\n\n@mhoye @benfrancis\n\nFully agree with you on the strategy for targetting low end devices, that\nnever felt realistic.\n\nI agree with Ben that there is space for a standards based platform that is\nuser focused, works across all of peoples various devices and isnt owned by 1\nof the 3 biggest companies in the world.\n\n49m\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\n@dale @benfrancis\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the FirefoxOS debacle we were running a tiny-by-\ncomparison project with Everything.Me, who made custom Android launchers.\n\nIt would have put Firefox between the screen and the OS, the Web front and\ncenter right there in the users' face, device drivers are somebody else's\nproblem and _any_ android user can have it for the asking, on any Android\nphone.\n\nI think there's still room in the world for that. But FirefoxOS was the\nopposite of that.\n\n30m\n\nDale Harvey @dale@toot.cafe\n\n@mhoye @benfrancis\n\nExactly, I think it was Fabrice who worked on packaging b2g as an android app\n/ launcher at some point as well. I did a lot of the e.me integration.\n\nYou will have a hard time finding anyone defending our corporate strategy,\nespecially in hidsight (but even at the time really) but I think there was and\nis something that could have made a big impact if done differently.\n\n17h\n\nBen Hearsum @bhearsum@fosstodon.org\n\n@mconley @fabrice @mhoye and not just firefox. Support teams like RelEng were\npulled in over and over as well (in combination with b2g having their own\nfolks doing things that we weren't equipped to do).\n\n5h\n\nMat\u011bj Cepl @mcepl@floss.social\n\n@fabrice @mconley @mhoye\n\n> Killing b2g after only shipping it for 2.5 years was so stupid for all of\n> Moz, including Desktop.\n\nTHIS. https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/firefox-os-post-mortem.html\n\nmatej.ceplovi.czFirefox OS post-mortem\n\n#B2G#FirefoxOS#Mozilla\n\n5h\n\nMat\u011bj Cepl @mcepl@floss.social\n\n@fabrice @mconley @mhoye\n\nAlso, killing https://marketplace.firefox.com/\n\nWas it because #Google didn\u2019t like the competition, or just the completely\nidiotic give-up?\n\n17h\n\nIan Bicking @ianbicking@hachyderm.io\n\n@mconley @fabrice @mhoye I recall Desktop/frontend (Firefox but not Gecko)\nbeing less than 10 people at the time, though both my memory and understanding\nat of the time were fuzzy. Once I understood the actual team distribution it\nseemed totally nuts how small desktop was.\n\nI don't know what the right way would have been to run Firefox desktop and b2g\nin parallel, but whatever it was that wasn't it.\n\n17h\n\nFabrice Desr\u00e9 @fabrice@fosstodon.org\n\n@ianbicking @mconley @mhoye Mozilla was not short on money back then either.\nThe obvious solution was to hire people.\n\n17h\n\nMike Conley (:mconley) @mconley@mozilla.social\n\n@fabrice @ianbicking @mhoye You're not listening. All resources were committed\nto b2g. We were in full-on skeleton-crew mode. There was _no budget_ to hire\nmore people because b2g was taking all of the budget.\n\nComplaining about Firefox Desktop not hiring enough people is ridiculous in\nthe grand scheme of things, and you know it.\n\n17h\n\nOsmose @Osmose@digipres.club\n\n@mconley @fabrice @ianbicking @mhoye Can confirm that if you weren't part of\nb2g, even if you were on a not-Firefox team like webdev/web prod, you\nbasically got ignored. It was a superb waste of time born of thinking that\nMozilla was a great generalized tech company and not just a great browser and\ndeveloper tooling company.\n\n15h\n\nStefan Arentz @st3fan\n\n@fabrice @ianbicking @mconley @mhoye Guess what the CTO decided.

David Baron @dbaron@w3c.social\n\n@mhoye The main factor he cited was web compatibility, which is largely a\nfunction of market share rather than technical.\n\nThat's not to say there weren't some major technical mistakes. Maybe some of\nthe biggest were:\n\n\\- not investing more in embedding APIs in 2006-2008 - not understanding and\nfixing the performance and memory use implications of extensions in 2006-2010\n(and fixing widely divergent eng vs mktg opinions of them)\n\nBut hard to say if doing better would have changed the result.\n\n17h\n\nmhoye @mhoye\n\n@dbaron I suppose I should have specified the time between those things, but I\nelided a lot of the experience of being at Moz then. The whole\nleadership/module-ownership question hovering around unanswered for months,\nthe deep schism between the Foundation and the Corporation that went\nunresolved forever, b2g sucking up all the air in the room, it was all pretty\nbad.\n\n15h\n\nBenjamin Smedberg @bsmedberg@mastodon.cloud\n\n@dbaron @mhoye not dealing with the ticking time-bomb that was extensions is\nIMO the most destructive decision that Brendan led and guided Mitchell + the\nboard to... even later 2011-2014. We had a plan to get to multi-process\ncontent in 2011 where the key problem was addon compat, and it was an exec-\nlevel decision to stop funding that and try to build magic bullets (CPOWs,\nwhich were doomed).\n\n15h\n\nBen Hearsum @bhearsum@fosstodon.org\n\n@bsmedberg @dbaron @mhoye ugh, everytime I remember that we _had_ e10s for so\nlong and just sat on it I get angry.\n\n13h\n\nKevin Brosnan @kbrosnan\n\n@bhearsum @bsmedberg @dbaron @mhoye\n\nFun fact: XUL Firefox for Android (XUL Fennec) was the first Firefox product\nto ship with e10s on a release build. The thought at the time was that e10s\nwould be on desktop _any_day_now_. Mobile would help dogfood it.
