That\u2019s the sound of an ultrasonic cold brew coffee ready in under\nthree minutes\n\n16 hours ago\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nNeil Martin,\n\nUNSW Sydney engineers have utilised sound waves to cut the time it takes to\nmake a cold brew coffee from many hours down to mere minutes.\n\nFans of cold brew coffee often rave about the smoother, less acidic and less\nbitter taste compared to a regular hot brew.\n\nThere\u2019s just one major problem \u2013 it takes anywhere from 12 to 24 hours to\nfully steep the grounds and allow the flavours to slowly be extracted using\nonly cold water.\n\nThat\u2019s far from ideal if you want or need your caffeine fix in a hurry in the\nmorning.\n\nHowever, engineers from UNSW have now developed a new way to make cold brew\ncoffee in under three minutes \u2013 just like a regular hot brew \u2013 without\nsacrificing on the taste experience.\n\nThe process involves using an ultrasonic reactor to speed up the brew of the\ngrounded coffee beans, with the research published in Ultrasonics\nSonochemistry.\n\n## The ultrasonic brew\n\nAddressing the challenge of speeding up the brewing process of a cold brew,\nthe UNSW team led by Dr Francisco Trujillo, used an existing model of a\nBreville espresso machine and superimposed their own patented sound\ntransmission system.\n\nThe system connects a bolt-clamped transducer with the brewing basket via a\nmetallic horn \u2013 transforming a standard espresso filter basket into a powerful\nultrasonic reactor.\n\nThe reactor works by injecting sound waves at a frequency of 38.8 kHz at\nmultiple points through its walls \u2013 generating multiple regions for acoustic\ncavitation within the reactor.\n\nThe new faster cold brew system subjects coffee grounds in the filter basket\nto ultrasonic sound waves from a transducer, via a specially adapted horn.\nUNSW/Francisco Trujillo\n\nThe study also found that this setup can double the extraction yield and\ncaffeine concentration compared to unsonicated samples.\n\nDr Trujillo, corresponding author of the paper and UNSW food processing\nengineer in the School of Chemical Engineering, says the ultrasound process\nspeeds up the extraction of the oils, flavours and aroma of the ground coffee.\n\n\u201cUltrasounds accelerate the extraction process due to acoustic cavitation,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n\u201cWhen acoustic bubbles collapse near the grounded coffee, they generate micro-\njets with enough force to pit and fracture the coffee grounds \u2013 intensifying\nthe extraction of the aroma and flavours of the brew.\n\n\u201cAnd the acceleration is enormous \u2013 we are reducing what would typically take\n12 to 24 hours to less than three minutes.\u201d\n\nDr. Trujillo says the aim was to make the process as easy as making a regular\nespresso coffee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to demonstrate that this can be adapted to existing espresso\nmachine,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about developing this technology that can be used by\ncompanies that already manufacture coffee machines, so consumers can enjoy an\nultrasonic cold brew at home in less than three minutes.\n\n\u201cVery importantly, this breakthrough opens the door for coffee shops and\nrestaurants to produce on-demand brews comparable to 24-hour cold brews,\nsupplying the rising demand while eliminating the need for large semi-\nindustrial brewing units and the associated requirement for extensive\nrefrigeration space.\u201d\n\nThe UNSW team who developed the three-minute cold brew - Shih-Hao Chiu, Dr\nFrancisco Trujillo and Nikunj Naliyadhara. UNSW/Cecilia Duong\n\n## Same taste in less time\n\nCollaborating with researchers from University of Queensland, samples of\ncoffee were sent to the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food (QAAFI)\nwhere they underwent a thorough sensory analysis.\n\nThe samples included cold brew sonicated at room temperature for one minute,\nthe second was sonicated for 3 minutes, and the third was a regular 24 hours\nstepped brew at four degrees Celsius without sonication.\n\nThey were evaluated on their aroma, texture, flavour, and aftertaste\nattributes.\n\n\u201cCompared to the 24-hour brew, the sonicated one-minute brew sample received\nsimilar ratings, especially in flavour, aftertaste attributes including\nbitterness, sourness, fullness texture and aroma,\u201d says Dr. Trujillo.\n\n\u201cHowever, it scored lower in aroma intensity and dark chocolate aroma. This\nsuggests that the sonicated 1-minute sample is slightly under-extracted\ncompared to the 24-hour cold brew.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the sonicated three-minute sample provided a similar dark\nchocolate aroma and aroma intensity to the 24-hour cold brew, but slightly\nmore bitter.\n\n\u201cThe results of the sensory study showed that a sonication time between one\nand three minutes is ideal for creating a coffee comparable with 24-hour cold\nbrew coffee, depending on the interest of customers.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Queensland Sensory Scientist and Flavour Chemist Professor\nHeather Smyth, a co-author of the paper, said the new method created a coffee\nas good as cold brew steeped overnight.\n\n\u201cOur trained sensory panel tastings proved that we can get a very similar\ntaste profile to either a traditional cold brew or an espresso in the time it\ntakes to brew a hot espresso,\u201d Prof. Smyth said.\n\n\u201cFurther work could explore different types of beans, different regions of\nbeans and for companies or cafes that specialise in single origin or high-\nquality beans, this would be another string to the bow to show yet another\ndimension of coffee.\n\n\u201cOnce again, Australia has new technology at our fingertips that moves on from\ntraditional methods to modern methods of coffee making to give consumers a new\npremium experience.\u201d\n\n## Shaking up the beverage industry\n\nUltrasounds can be applied to several areas across the food industry including\ndrying, extraction, emulsification and crystallisation \u2013 making the process\nfaster and more efficient.\n\nDr. Trujillo says this technology can be also used to speed up the brewing\nprocess of teas as well.\n\n\u201cWith this technology, we\u2019re offering coffee shops, restaurants and even home\ncoffee-brewers the chance to produce on-demand brews, eliminating the need for\nlarge brewing and refrigeration units.\u201d\n\n### Media enquiries\n\nFor enquiries about this story and interview requests please contact Neil\nMartin.\n\nEmail: n.martin@unsw.edu.au\n\nFeatured experts\n\nFrancisco Trujillo,\n\n## Share this story\n\n  * Share this page on Email\n  * Share this page on Facebook\n  * Share this page on Twitter\n  * Share this page on LinkedIn\n  * Share this page on WhatsApp\n  * Share this page on FacebookMessenger\n  * Share this page on WeChat\n  * Share this page on Copy\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * ### Why plant-based 'milks' are rising to the top\n\n27 July 2022\n\n  * ### Safe enough to eat - dishing up the answers in...\n\n6 June 2021\n\n  * ### Breakfast impacts student success, but...\n\n15 April 2024\n\n  * ### Salt, calcium and vitamin D \u2013 do you get...\n\n19 January 2023\n\nTop\n\nUNSW.edu.au\n\nUNSW Sydney NSW 2052 Australia Telephone: +61 2 93851000\n\nUNSW CRICOS Provider Code: 00098G TEQSA Provider ID: PRV12055 ABN: 57 195 873\n179\n\n## Acknowledgement of Country\n\nUNSW is located on the unceded territory of the Bidjigal (Kensington campus),\nGadigal (City and Paddington Campuses) and Ngunnawal peoples (UNSW Canberra)\nwho are the Traditional Owners of the lands where each campus of UNSW is\nsituated.\n\nThe Uluru Statement\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * Follow UNSW on LinkedIn\n  * Follow UNSW on Twitter (X)\n  * Follow UNSW on Facebook\n  * Follow UNSW on Instagram\n  * Follow UNSW on TikTok\n  * Follow UNSW on YouTube\n  * Follow UNSW on WeChat\n  * Follow UNSW on Weibo\n\n  * Privacy statement\n  * Copyright & Disclaimer\n  * Accessibility\n  * Site feedback\n  * Complaints\n\n", "frontpage": true}
