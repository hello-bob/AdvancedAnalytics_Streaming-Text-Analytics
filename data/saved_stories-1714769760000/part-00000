And cannot be used for any medical\npurposes!!!\n\nThis project is the result of several years of work on the development of BCI.\nWe believe that the easiest way to get started with biosignals is to use a\nshield. We will try to reveal the process of reading EEG signals as fully and\nclearly as possible.\n\n#### Warnings\n\nWarning\n\nYou are fully responsible for your personal decision to purchase this device\nand, ultimately, for its safe use. ardEEG is not a medical device and has not\nbeen certified by any government regulatory agency for use with the human\nbody. Use it at your own risk.\n\nCaution\n\nThe device must operate only from a battery - 5 V. Complete isolation from the\nmains power is required.! The device MUST not be connected to any kind of\nmains power, via USB or otherwise. Power supply - only battery 5V\n\n#### How it Works\n\nConnect the shield to Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and after that connect the device to\na battery (power supply) and connect electrodes. Full galvanic isolation from\nmains is required. Electrodes are positioned according to the International\n10-20 system\n\n#### Device Pinout\n\nShield connected with Arduino Uno R4 only at the next points:\n\n#### Description of Code\n\nArduino script does not allow reading data from ADS1299 with a frequency of\n250 Hz. It's necessary to use .c or .cpp scripts for reading data in real-time\nand Python for signal processing and visualization.\n\n#### Video presentation\n\nIn this video you can see how to measure EEG\n\n)\n\n#### For Beginners\n\nDuring the measurement, in addition to artifacts caused by muscle activity, be\nconcerned about the increased resistance between the body and the floor. For\nexample, in the picture below, the moment when the feet touch the floor with\nand without an insulated shoe. Without insulated shoes - increased noise is\nnoticeable.\n\n#### Artifact test\n\nThe process of measuring chewing and blinking artifacts using dry electrodes\n(Fz). Chewing occurred in the following sequence: 4 times, 3 times, 2, and 1\ntime, and the same for the blinking process. The y- axis is the processed EEG\nsignal after passing filter bands of 1-40 Hz in microvolts and with 250\nsamples per second Dataset\n\n#### Alpha test\n\nThe process of recording an EEG signal from an electrode (Fz) with eyes open\nand closed. The y- axis is the processed EEG signal after passing filter bands\nof 8-12Hz in microvolts and with 250 samples per second\n\nDataset\n\n8 channels reading example\n\n#### Citation\n\nIn process\n\n#### Contacts\n\nildarr2016@gmail.com http://pieeg.com/\n\n## About\n\nArduino for measure EEG, EMG, and ECG bio-signals\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n4 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 66.6%\n  * C++ 33.4%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
