The company launched LinkedIn Games this week after\ntesting the gaming waters earlier this year. The new puzzle and logic games\nare free, straightforward, and only a little bit of a ripoff of The New York\nTimes\u2019 very popular game offerings.\n\nIn a blog post attributed to LinkedIn VP Daniel Roth, the company said the\ngoal of the games is to give users a short mental break while on the platform.\n(And, of course, the unspoken part: Games keep people on the platform longer\nand drive engagement.)\n\nCurrently, there are three games available. Pinpoint feels like playing a\nsingle row of the The New York Times\u2019 Connections games. Crossclimb is a\nWordle-esque matching game where you answer clues to solve a larger riddle.\nQueens is a mashup of chess and Sudoku that annoyed me just enough to ensure\nthat I felt spitefully compelled to finish it no matter what. (I filed this\nstory to my editor late because of it. It\u2019s pretty good.)\n\nFeatured Video\n\nLike The New York Times\u2019 games, LinkedIn\u2019s games can be played just once per\nday. Users can share their scores directly on the platform, in case anyone\nneeds to make posting on LinkedIn even more competitive.\n\nHere\u2019s some other consumer tech news from this week.\n\n## Face Plant\n\nSurprise surprise, Razer\u2019s not-so-futuristic light-up face mask is bad,\nactually. Razer is known for its use of colorful RGB lightning in just about\nall of its products, even though the flashy display scheme proved somewhat\nunderwhelming on its Zephyr face mask. Even worse, the company claimed the\nmask had the equivalent filtration qualities of an N95 mask, which can filter\nout harmful particles as well as viruses.\n\nTurns out, that capability was never formally tested. Now, the Federal Trade\nCommission has ordered the company to pay for making these claims about the\nmask\u2019s capabilities, forcing the company to refund the money of every customer\nwho bought one\u2014to the tune of over a million dollars. ($1,071,254.33 to be\nexact.)\n\nThe company first sold its $99 device in October 2021, deep in the midst of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic. The Zephyr capitalized on a fear of infection that was\nstill very much top of mind for many people. Razer claimed the mask could\nfilter out particles, including Covid-carrying particles, just as well as any\nstandard N95 mask. But, as the FTC says, the company never submitted it for\ncertification with NIOSH, the US safety agency that certifies all N95\nstandards. Now the company has to pay for that error.\n\n## Peloton Problems\n\nPeloton, the connected-exercise-equipment company that became a huge hit with\nwealthy people confined in their homes during the pandemic, has had some\ntrouble in recent years. Peloton first rolled into financial issues in 2021,\nwhen demand for its products waned and its stock price plummeted. Now the\ncompany has hit an even slipperier slope.\n\nIn the space of a couple of days, Peloton announced the departure of its CEO,\nBarry McCarthy, and that it would be laying off 15 percent of its\nworkforce\u2014nearly 400 employees. It\u2019s not a great look for a company that once\nseemed set to revolutionize the home-exercise-equipment industry.\n\n## Hybrid Theory\n\nUsed to be that when someone said \u201chybrid\u201d you\u2019d think of the Toyota Prius,\nfor better or worse. Hybrids were always the pudgy, weird little vehicle that\nmaybe didn\u2019t fit the typical idea of a \u201ccool car.\u201d At least that\u2019s how the\ncategory was defined before a new wave of hybrid vehicles started to swell\ninto the market. Now, hybrids are becoming cool; there\u2019s even a souped-up\nLamborghini plug-in hybrid. These gas-electric machines are also more popular\nthan ever in the US, thanks to some government mandates that urge automakers\nto move toward a zero-emission future.\n\nThis week on Gadget Lab, WIRED staff writer Aarian Marshall joins the show to\ntalk about how hybrids are taking over the American vehicle market.\n\n#### Content\n\nTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site\nit originates from.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?
