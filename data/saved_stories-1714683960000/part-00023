That's why we've built Blue to take advantage\nof the speed and convenience that comes with native MacOS application.\n\n### A MacOS native app\n\nThe tight integration between Blue and MacOS allows it to interact with your\napps and data in a seamless fashion. No more fidgeting with browser tabs or\ncutting and pasting.

We never save any data\nthat is sent with the app. And of course you can also toggle AppVision off\nwhenever you want.\n\n## Fundamental focus on privacy\n\nWe are strong privacy advocates, and Blue takes a very simple approach to\nprivacy: We don't need a complicated data processing policy because we don't\nstore your data. We don't need a cookie banner because we don't track you.\n\nFar too many companies make this seem overly complicated because they want to\ngive you the impression they care about your privacy when they really don't.\nWe strive to be different. We believe that user privacy is a fundamental right\nand not just talk.\n\n### Your Data is Stored On Your Mac\n\nAll your messages, files and other data in Blue is kept on your Mac and is\nencrypted with your Apple ID. We don't have access to any of your data after a\nmessage has been processed.\n\n### No Training on Your Data\n\nMany AI assistants store and use your queries and data to improve the\nunderlying AI models. Blue never uses your data in this way.\n\n### Powered by Microsoft\n\nWe have partnered with Microsoft for running the AI models because of their\nstellar record of privacy and security. There are no other partners involved\nin serving our customers.\n\n### Makes GDPR Compliance Easy\n\nAll message data and PII is stored on device. All traffic is encrypted with\nTLS 1.2+. Our data centers are located in the European Union and no data ever\nleaves the EU for EU users.\n\n### Privacy Comparison\n\nWhile most AI assistants are built for consumer use, Blue is designed from the\nground up to offer superior privacy for professional users.\n\nChatGPT| ChatGPT Team| Blue Starter| Blue Pro  \n---|---|---|---  \nYour data is used to train the models| Yes| No| No| No  \nYour messages and files are stored in the cloud| Yes| Yes| No| No  \nData is processed outside the EU| Yes| Yes| Yes| No  \nThird party scripts and tracking in App| Yes| Yes| No| No  \n  \n## Simple pricing, for everyone\n\nTry it out!
