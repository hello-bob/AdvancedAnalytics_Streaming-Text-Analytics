The\ntypes of colors we use and the way in which we use them are quite different\nfor these three cases.\n\n## 4.1 Color as a tool to distinguish\n\nWe frequently use color as a means to distinguish discrete items or groups\nthat do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or\ndifferent manufacturers of a certain product. In this case, we use a\nqualitative color scale. Such a scale contains a finite set of specific colors\nthat are chosen to look clearly distinct from each other while also being\nequivalent to each other. The second condition requires that no one color\nshould stand out relative to the others. And, the colors should not create the\nimpression of an order, as would be the case with a sequence of colors that\nget successively lighter. Such colors would create an apparent order among the\nitems being colored, which by definition have no order.\n\nMany appropriate qualitative color scales are readily available. Figure 4.1\nshows three representative examples. In particular, the ColorBrewer project\nprovides a nice selection of qualitative color scales, including both fairly\nlight and fairly dark colors (Brewer 2017).\n\nFigure 4.1: Example qualitative color scales. The Okabe Ito scale is the\ndefault scale used throughout this book (Okabe and Ito 2008). The ColorBrewer\nDark2 scale is provided by the ColorBrewer project (Brewer 2017). The ggplot2\nhue scale is the default qualitative scale in the widely used plotting\nsoftware ggplot2.\n\nAs an example of how we use qualitative color scales, consider Figure 4.2. It\nshows the percent population growth from 2000 to 2010 in U.S. states. I have\narranged the states in order of their population growth, and I have colored\nthem by geographic region. This coloring highlights that states in the same\nregions have experienced similar population growth. In particular, states in\nthe West and the South have seen the largest population increases whereas\nstates in the Midwest and the Northeast have grown much less.\n\nFigure 4.2: Population growth in the U.S. from 2000 to 2010. States in the\nWest and South have seen the largest increases, whereas states in the Midwest\nand Northeast have seen much smaller increases or even, in the case of\nMichigan, a decrease. Data source: U.S. Census Bureau\n\n## 4.2 Color to represent data values\n\nColor can also be used to represent data values, such as income, temperature,\nor speed. In this case, we use a sequential color scale. Such a scale contains\na sequence of colors that clearly indicate (i) which values are larger or\nsmaller than which other ones and (ii) how distant two specific values are\nfrom each other. The second point implies that the color scale needs to be\nperceived to vary uniformly across its entire range.\n\nSequential scales can be based on a single hue (e.g., from dark blue to light\nblue) or on multiple hues (e.g., from dark red to light yellow) (Figure 4.3).\nMulti-hue scales tend to follow color gradients that can be seen in the\nnatural world, such as dark red, green, or blue to light yellow, or dark\npurple to light green. The reverse, e.g. dark yellow to light blue, looks\nunnatural and doesn\u2019t make a useful sequential scale.\n\nFigure 4.3: Example sequential color scales. The ColorBrewer Blues scale is a\nmonochromatic scale that varies from dark to light blue. The Heat and Viridis\nscales are multi-hue scales that vary from dark red to light yellow and from\ndark blue via green to light yellow, respectively.\n\nRepresenting data values as colors is particularly useful when we want to show\nhow the data values vary across geographic regions. In this case, we can draw\na map of the geographic regions and color them by the data values. Such maps\nare called choropleths. Figure 4.4 shows an example where I have mapped annual\nmedian income within each county in Texas onto a map of those counties.\n\nFigure 4.4: Median annual income in Texas counties. The highest median incomes\nare seen in major Texas metropolitan areas, in particular near Houston and\nDallas. No median income estimate is available for Loving County in West Texas\nand therefore that county is shown in gray. Data source: 2015 Five-Year\nAmerican Community Survey\n\nIn some cases, we need to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two\ndirections relative to a neutral midpoint. One straightforward example is a\ndataset containing both positive and negative numbers. We may want to show\nthose with different colors, so that it is immediately obvious whether a value\nis positive or negative as well as how far in either direction it deviates\nfrom zero. The appropriate color scale in this situation is a diverging color\nscale. We can think of a diverging scale as two sequential scales stiched\ntogether at a common midpoint, which usually is represented by a light color\n(Figure 4.5). Diverging scales need to be balanced, so that the progression\nfrom light colors in the center to dark colors on the outside is approximately\nthe same in either direction. Otherwise, the perceived magnitude of a data\nvalue would depend on whether it fell above or below the midpoint value.\n\nFigure 4.5: Example diverging color scales. Diverging scales can be thought of\nas two sequential scales stiched together at a common midpoint color. Common\ncolor choices for diverging scales include brown to greenish blue, pink to\nyellow-green, and blue to red.\n\nAs an example application of a diverging color scale, consider Figure 4.6,\nwhich shows the percentage of people identifying as white in Texas counties.\nEven though percentage is always a positive number, a diverging scale is\njustified here, because 50% is a meaningful midpoint value. Numbers above 50%\nindicate that whites are in the majority and numbers below 50% indicate the\nopposite. The visualization clearly shows in which counties whites are in the\nmajority, in which they are in the minority, and in which whites and non-\nwhites occur in approximately equal proportions.\n\nFigure 4.6: Percentage of people identifying as white in Texas counties.\nWhites are in the majority in North and East Texas but not in South or West\nTexas. Data source: 2010 Decennial U.S. Census\n\n## 4.3 Color as a tool to highlight\n\nColor can also be an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the\ndata. There may be specific categories or values in the dataset that carry key\ninformation about the story we want to tell, and we can strengthen the story\nby emphasizing the relevant figure elements to the reader. An easy way to\nachieve this emphasis is to color these figure elements in a color or set of\ncolors that vividly stand out against the rest of the figure. This effect can\nbe achieved with accent color scales, which are color scales that contain both\na set of subdued colors and a matching set of stronger, darker, and/or more\nsaturated colors (Figure 4.7).\n\nFigure 4.7: Example accent color scales, each with four base colors and three\naccent colors. Accent color scales can be derived in several different ways:\n(top) we can take an existing color scale (e.g., the Okabe Ito scale, Fig 4.1)\nand lighten and/or partially desaturate some colors while darkening others;\n(middle) we can take gray values and pair them with colors; (bottom) we can\nuse an existing accent color scale, e.g. the one from the ColorBrewer project.\n\nAs an example of how the same data can support differing stories with\ndifferent coloring approaches, I have created a variant of Figure 4.2 where\nnow I highlight two specific states, Texas and Louisiana (Figure 4.8). Both\nstates are in the South, they are immediate neighbors, and yet one state\n(Texas) was the fifth-fastest growing state within the U.S. whereas the other\nwas the third slowest growing from 2000 to 2010.\n\nFigure 4.8: From 2000 to 2010, the two neighboring southern states Texas and\nLouisiana have experienced among the highest and lowest population growth\nacross the U.S. Data source: U.S. Census Bureau\n\nWhen working with accent colors, it is critical that the baseline colors do\nnot compete for attention. Notice how drab the baseline colors are in (Figure\n4.8). Yet they work well to support the accent color. It is easy to make the\nmistake of using baseline colors that are too colorful, so that they end up\ncompeting for the reader\u2019s attention against the accent colors. There is an\neasy remedy, however. Just remove all color from all elements in the figure\nexcept the highlighted data categories or points. An example of this strategy\nis provided in Figure 4.9.\n\nFigure 4.9: Track athletes are among the shortest and leanest of male\nprofessional athletes participating in popular sports.
