A\ntotal of 283 bodies were recovered at Nasser Hospital, of which 42 were\nidentified.\n\n\u201cAmong the deceased were allegedly older people, women and wounded, while\nothers were found tied with their hands...tied and stripped of their clothes,\u201d\nsaid Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human\nRights.\n\n## Al-Shifa discovery\n\nCiting the local health authorities in Gaza, Ms. Shamdasani added that more\nbodies had been found at Al-Shifa Hospital.\n\nThe large health complex was the enclave\u2019s main tertiary facility before war\nerupted on 7 October. It was the focus of an Israeli military incursion to\nroot out Hamas militants allegedly operating inside which ended at the\nbeginning of this month. After two weeks of intense clashes, UN humanitarians\nassessed the site and confirmed on 5 April that Al-Shifa was \u201can empty shell\u201d,\nwith most equipment reduced to ashes.\n\n\u201cReports suggest that there were 30 Palestinian bodies buried in two graves in\nthe courtyard of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City; one in front of the emergency\nbuilding and the others in front of the dialysis building,\u201d Ms. Shamdasani\ntold journalists in Geneva.\n\nThe bodies of 12 Palestinians have now been identified from these locations at\nAl-Shifa, the OHCHR spokesperson continued, but identification has not yet\nbeen possible for the remaining individuals.\n\n\u201cThere are reports that the hands of some of these bodies were also tied,\u201d Ms.\nShamdasani said, adding that there could be \u201cmany more\u201d victims, \u201cdespite the\nclaim by the Israeli Defense Forces to have killed 200 Palestinians during the\nAl-Shifa medical complex operation\u201d.\n\n## 200 days of horror\n\nSome 200 days since intense Israeli bombardment began in response to Hamas-led\nterror attacks in southern Israel, UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk expressed\nhis horror at the destruction of Nasser and Al-Shifa hospitals and the\nreported discovery of mass graves.\n\nTweet URL\n\n> UNHumanRights\n\n\u201cThe intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are hors de\ncombat is a war crime,\u201d Mr. T\u00fcrk said in a call for independent investigations\ninto the deaths.\n\n## Mounting toll\n\nAs of 22 April, more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza,\nincluding 14,685 children and 9,670 women, the High Commissioner\u2019s office\nsaid, citing the enclave\u2019s health authorities. Another 77,084 have been\ninjured, and over 7,000 others are assumed to be under the rubble.\n\n\u201cEvery 10 minutes a child is killed or wounded. They are protected under the\nlaws of war, and yet they are ones who are disproportionately paying the\nultimate price in this war,\u201d said the High Commissioner.\n\n## T\u00fcrk warning\n\nThe UN rights chief also reiterated his warning against a full-scale Israeli\nincursion of Rafah, where an estimated 1.2 million Gazans \u201chave been forcibly\ncornered\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s leaders stand united on the imperative of protecting the civilian\npopulation trapped in Rafah,\u201d the High Commissioner said in a statement, which\nalso condemned Israeli strikes against Rafah in recent days that mainly killed\nwomen and children.\n\nThis included an attack on an apartment building in the Tal Al Sultan area on\n19 April which killed nine Palestinians \u201cincluding six children and two\nwomen\u201d, along with a strike on As Shabora Camp in Rafah a day later that\nreportedly left four dead, including a girl and a pregnant woman.\n\n\u201cThe latest images of a premature child taken from the womb of her dying\nmother, of the adjacent two houses where 15 children and five women were\nkilled, this is beyond warfare,\u201d said Mr. T\u00fcrk.\n\nThe High Commissioner decried the \u201cunspeakable suffering\u201d caused by months of\nwarfare and appealed once again for \u201cthe resulting misery and destruction,\nstarvation and disease and the risk of wider conflict\u201d to end.\n\nMr. T\u00fcrk also reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire, the release of\nall remaining hostages taken from Israel and those held in arbitrary detention\nand the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.\n\n\u00a9 WHO\n\nA young girl is transferred from the Kamal Adwan hospital, in the far north of\nGaza to a hospital in the south of the enclave.
