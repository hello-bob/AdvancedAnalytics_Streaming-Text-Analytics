All those miracle skin care\nproducts, k-pop, k-drama, that buzzy blockbuster that wins the Oscar, the only\nsmartphone line that competes with the iPhone anymore, your dependable car,\nyour washer and dryer that never quit, the flat screen TV in every hotel room.\nThe only thing Koreans don\u2019t make... is more Koreans. In the space of a human\nlifetime, the South Korean populace has gone from some 20% urban to over 90%.\nKorea has attained a quality of life that in material terms has few rivals.\nAnd with all that societal-level prosperity: the progress, the innovation and\nthe productivity has come an immeasurable toll payable at the individual\nlevel: the dwindling or extinction of millions of human lineages. Families who\nare not childless today often have only a single child. At current rates, by\n2100, Korea\u2019s population will fall by half. Korea is an extreme example, but\nthis dynamic is playing out all over the developed world.\n\nPlotting women\u2019s total fertility rate against percent urbanization yields an\ninverse correlation of -0.48, meaning that the more urbanized a nation, the\nfewer children born per woman. Today, the urbanization of nations below 2.0\ntotal fertility averages 70%, while that of nations above 2.0 is 52%.\n\nWhere we flock to dynamic cities, we compete and collaborate, we prosper, we\ninnovate, and we change human society the world over, innovation by\ninnovation. And in the process, our fertility collapses. In Roman times, it\nwasn\u2019t immediate fertility so much as that the numerous children of the urbs,\neven the most privileged ones, didn\u2019t survive at the same rates as their\ncounterparts in the sleepier hinterlands. Today we don\u2019t even conceive them.\nCities are an incredibly recent phenomenon in our history (our species has\nbeen anatomically modern for 200,000 years, during just 9,400 of which any\nhumans, and then usually only a tiny minority, have dwelt in cities). I have\nreflected previously on the striking finding that two millennia on, the\nillustrious inhabitants of one of the most culturally influential societies to\ngrace our planet, the Roman Empire, have fingerprints on nearly every aspect\nof modern society, and yet left nary a genetic trace even on the peninsula\nthat Rome calls home. Here, I circle back to that line of thinking and reflect\non why the comparatively plodding pace of human evolution is no match for the\nbreakneck clip at which we drive cultural evolution when we come together in\nurban centers. Cities make us. Their uniquely unlimited possibility plays on\nour innate drive for status and material success (assured routes to improved\nreproductive outcomes elsewhere). And they break us, material success in the\nworld\u2019s cities coming at a cost that can be enumerated in tiny empty desks,\ndesolate playgrounds and former maternity wards being converted into\nfacilities for the burgeoning elderly population.\n\nIn the film Gladiator, set during the father and son reigns of Emperors Marcus\nAurelius and Commodus, the only other member of the imperial family featured\nis Lucilla, daughter to the elder emperor, sister to the younger. In actuality\nthough, over time, the historical Commodus had over a dozen siblings. But most\nof them, including his own twin brother, did not live to adulthood. Besides\nCommodus and Lucilla, their sisters Annia and Vibia survived to reproduce; but\nof Marcus Aurelius and his wife Faustina the Younger\u2019s thirteen children, nine\nwere not so lucky. So two in three children of the most powerful couple in the\nlargest city in the world expired young, sobering testament to the non-\nnegotiable caprices of biological forces in the lives of premodern people.\nMarcus Aurelius\u2019 offspring lived and died subject to the same whims of nature\nas any peasant spawn. Roman medicine was primitive at best and\ncounterproductive at worst. Ancient civilization had mastered arcane aspects\nof metallurgy, architecture and agriculture, but physiology, anatomy and\nimmunology remained as mysterious to the Romans as they had been to their\nPleistocene forebears. The conquest of human biology, and therefore scientific\nmedicine and public health would have to wait all the way until humanity's\nmost recent few centuries of history.\n\nIn actual fact though, no matter how elite their pater, Marcus Aurelius\u2019\nchildren were subject to even more inclement forces than those faced by their\npeasant contemporaries in the countryside of Latium. Though they are\napproximations at best, the scholarly literature holds that about half of\nRoman children survived to adulthood, a sight better than Commodus\u2019 sibling\ncohort fared. And the sorry outcome of most of Marcus Aurelius\u2019 issue might\nwell represent a best case for the children born to the Roman urbs. The\nEmperor\u2019s offspring would have spent much of their time in Palatine Hill\u2019s\nsumptuous, airy palaces, rather than the fetid Suburra below, a vast slum\noccupied by the Roman underclass. And unlike many inhabitants of the Roman\nEmpire, the emperor\u2019s children would have fed well on a rich and varied diet\nof meat, fish, fruit, vegetables and grains. But even still, the Roman elite\nwere surrounded by the second-century city\u2019s teeming masses, its million\ninhabitants crowding in around them. At 13.7 km^2, Antonine Rome recorded a\npopulation density of 72,000 people/km^2. Our densest modern city is Manila,\nat 43,000/km^2. Manhattan, this country\u2019s idea of dense, sits at 28,000\npeople/km^2. The visible squalor and inescapable stench that dominated\nantiquity\u2019s megacities is surely beyond our imagining. Perhaps the only\nrealistic sense we might obtain would come in slums like Dharavi in Mumbai.\n\nLife in the premodern world was often short and brutal; plague, famine and war\nalways lurked. As early as 3000 BC you see evidence of this, with the collapse\nof village life all across Europe upon introduction of plague from the east (a\nrecurring event whose relentlessness was seemingly dictated by the massive\nreservoir of livestock animals incubating pathogens on the Eurasian steppe).\nAncient people knew though that the toll of plague and disease impacted cities\nmore than the hinterlands. Fresh country air, in place of the dusty and\npolluted miasma that suffused the urban slums, was understood to be\nsalubrious. Later, better transportation allowed for the emergence of suburbs,\nreleasing yet more pressure on the urban core, with the poor no longer\ncondemned to live in cheek-by-jowl dystopian conditions.\n\nBut for all its rankness and grime, the ancient city was the hinge of\ncivilization, the nexus around which the literate classes who recorded their\nera\u2019s enduring histories gathered and indeed flourished. An increasingly urban\nengine of creativity drove intellectual, economic and political power. These\nwere the human cultures that would not only reshape their age but reach across\nmillennia to touch our own in countless crucial ways worked out in the city\u2019s\ntaverns, public squares, courts and academies. Historian of religion Rodney\nStark wrote Cities of God to document the fundamentally urban character of\nearly Christianity; the term pagan was synonymous not just with unbelievers,\nbut also with rural peasants. The future was to be determined by the direction\nRoman culture took in its cities, not in the vast rural hinterlands. But this\nurban cultural ferment came with a punishing biological mortgage: the men and\nwomen with their fingerprints all over the world of ideas left no imprint on\nposterity genetically. If ancient cities were dynamic engines of culture,\nbirthing whole new civilizational social structures, it was almost as if for\nfuel they required vast graveyards\u2019 worth of spent human lineages\n\nMarcus Aurelius\u2019 milieu, the Greco-Roman world of Classical Antiquity, is a\nperfect example of this reality. For the Greeks, the city, the polis, was the\nstate. Most imperial subjects and citizens of the Roman Empire were peasants,\nbut the imperium under which they lived was operationally a Mediterranean-wide\ncollection of cities bound together by roads and seaways, administered by\nbureaucrats and gentry. It is these cities that preserved records for our\nresearch, and it is they that produced texts like the New Testament that have\nproved foundational to the course of Western civilization. But we can now also\nfinally examine ancient DNA from these dynamic cities that went from strength\nto strength, the lynchpins and anchors of the ancient world\u2019s most powerful\nstate. And that DNA paints a very different picture, one of ceaseless defeat\nin the face of pathogens.\n\n###\n\nThe roads to extinction\n\nA common idea runs that before the advent of trains, planes and highways, the\naverage human rarely left their home village. This model imagines the world of\nthe peasant delimited by field, farmhouse and market. A timeless scene marked\ngeneration after generation by little more variety than the change of seasons,\na world of sedentism after the close of the forager\u2019s age.\n\nBut this was not the only model. The remains of an ancient individual known to\narchaeology as the Amesbury Archer were buried three miles from Stonehenge\nmore than 4,300 years ago, some two millennia after the arrival of settled\nfarmers to Britain. His burial goods indicate that he was of high status.\nThough he died in Copper Age Britain, the isotopes in his bones indicate that\nhe reached manhood on the European continent, near the Alps, 750 km away for a\nbird, and far longer of course for an ancient archer traversing ocean, river\nand valley floor. More recently, ancient DNA has also produced evidence of\nsecond and third cousins buried 5,000 years ago in gravesites at completely\nopposite ends of the Eurasian steppe, in Mongolia and Eastern Europe, a\nstartling illustration of the extent of early nomads\u2019 appetite for ultra-long-\ndistance migration. A man or woman born on the Pontic steppe at Europe\u2019s\neastern edge might by the end of life be resident (and thus eventually buried)\nin the distant summer pastures of Mongolia\u2019s Altai.\n\nNomadic mobility is a natural consequence of their way of life, driving vast\nherds, followed by caravans of carts. They may not have rivaled the speed of\nVictorian-era trains, but even the annual life cycle of pastoralist peoples\ncould often entail migration between winter and summer pastures hundreds of\nkilometers apart. With rare exceptions, farmers do not move with the seasons,\nthey merely endure the seasons moving over them. Though initial phases of\nagriculture\u2019s expansion involve migration and long-distance colonization,\nfarming societies rapidly reach static equilibrium, where cultural evolution\nslows to a crawl as a population comes into balance with the local \u201ccarrying\ncapacity.\u201d Faced with both climatic volatility that threatened famine and\nrent-seeking elites wreaking political instability, peasants grasped for\nstasis in a bid for survival; even today, farmers remain notoriously\nconservative because that was the surest path to survival in the premodern\nworld. European peasants\u2019 conservatism famously retarded the adoption of\npotatoes by centuries.\n\nBoth after the end of the Ice Age 11,700 years ago and up to when the\nIndustrial Revolution of the 19th century dawned, these peasants formed the\nbackbone of human societies. To a first approximation, to be human was to be a\npeasant. In all ancient societies, elites trusted that land ownership was the\nmost stable and secure form of wealth given that cultivators\u2019 economic\nproduction was the foundation of civilization. But despite the primacy of the\npeasant as civilization\u2019s bedrock, by the time text preserves narrative\nhistory, cities were the nodes around which civilization progressed, evolved\nand eventually attained unprecedented heights of complexity.\n\nThe first civilization of Sumer was not a single polity, but a commonwealth of\ncities, from Ur in the south to Kish in the north. If farmers were the sturdy\nbody of agricultural civilization, cities were its head. After Sumer came\nBabylonia, named for its capital city, and then the Greeks, whose loyalty to\ntheir polis, their cities, transcended any national identity. Thus the society\nthat became the Roman Empire was heir to a 3,000-year legacy of literate urban\ncivilization beginning in Mesopotamia, and the Romans, like their Greek\npredecessors, remained a people focused on their city. Republican Rome was\norganized around \u201ctribes\u201d that voted in blocs. Most of these were rural,\nlocated outside Rome proper (just two urban tribes represented the city\u2019s\nproletariat and these had minimal voting power). But the rural tribes'\npolitical leadership flexed their power within the walls of the city, with\ntheir senators and tribunes holding forth in Rome\u2019s Forum, charting the\ndirection of the Republic from the urban apartments where they held court with\ntheir clients.\n\nAt its peak, somewhere between 10-20% of the citizens of the Empire lived in\ncities; a threshold not regained in Europe until the 1800\u2019s. In Italy, as much\nas 20-30% of the population may have been urban, concentrated around several\nlarge cities like Rome, Syracuse and Ravenna. At their peaks, Rome in the west\nand Constantinople in the east may have topped a million residents each. These\nnumbers were entirely unsustainable on the backs of the agricultural\nproduction in their hinterlands alone. In later centuries, Rome relied on\ngrain shipped from North Africa, Constantinople on wheat from Egypt. Complex\nagricultural civilizations like Rome broke beyond the self-sustaining autarky\nof village life, their maritime routes and roads teeming with manufactured\ngoods and produce, a sophisticated network that brought housewares and fine\nwine even to remote Britain. The collapse of the western Roman Empire in the\ncenturies after 400 AD was the implosion of an entire economic system;\narchaeologist Bryan Ward-Perkins famously publicized the finding that\npollution in British ponds did not reach Roman levels again until the\nIndustrial Revolution.\n\nWhile the Greeks are famed in the ancient world for their achievements in\nabstract analysis, and for pioneering mathematics, science and philosophy, the\nRomans were a more practical people, introducing aqueducts, domes and long\nstraight cobblestone roads across their empire. Though Roman roads were\noriginally built with strictly military ends in mind, facilitating the march\nof legions from one end of the Empire to the other, in peacetime they were\nbyways of trade and transit. Roman engineering prowess was such that even\n1,600 years after the Empire departed Britain, motorists still use 10 Roman\nroads on that island.\n\nThough the Roman transport infrastructure, from roads and canals to vast\nfleets of ships, their cargo holds bursting with grain, was instrumental in\nmoving goods from one end of the Empire to the other, it also crucially\nfacilitated the mass migration of peoples. By the time of the Empire, as many\nas 40% of the grave sites in Rome bore epitaphs written in the Greek alphabet,\nand second-century AD poet Juvenal complained of foreign influence in the\ncity, quipping that the \u201cSyrian Orontes has flowed into the [Roman] Tiber.\u201d\nThe textual and archaeological evidence is clear; after Juvenal\u2019s time, Rome\ngrew more foreign still, with even the rulers of the Eternal City all hailing\nfrom the Empire\u2019s periphery after 200 AD. And the DNA supports this\ncontention; the reality the ancient Romans recorded comports with the genetic\nevidence.\n\n###\n\nCultural ghosts, material genes\n\n## This post is for paid subscribers\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
