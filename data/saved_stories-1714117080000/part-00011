It has become feasible to\n> bootstrap a self-sustaining, self-expanding industry at reasonably low cost.\n> Simple modeling was developed to identify the main parameters of successful\n> bootstrapping. This indicates that bootstrapping can be achieved with as\n> little as 12 metric tons (MT) landed on the Moon during a period of about 20\n> years. The equipment will be teleoperated and then transitioned to full\n> autonomy so the industry can spread to the asteroid belt and beyond. The\n> strategy begins with a sub-replicating system and evolves it toward full\n> self-sustainability (full closure) via an in situ technology spiral. The\n> industry grows exponentially due to the free real estate, energy, and\n> material resources of space. The mass of industrial assets at the end of\n> bootstrapping will be 156 MT with 60 humanoid robots, or as high as 40,000\n> MT with as many as 100,000 humanoid robots if faster manufacturing is\n> supported by launching a total of 41 MT to the Moon. Within another few\n> decades with no further investment, it can have millions of times the\n> industrial capacity of the United States. Modeling over wide parameter\n> ranges indicates this is reasonable, but further analysis is needed. This\n> industry promises to revolutionize the human condition.\n\nComments:| 24 pages, 14 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for\nAstrophysics (astro-ph.IM)  \nCite as:| arXiv:1612.03238 [physics.pop-ph]  \n(or arXiv:1612.03238v1 [physics.pop-ph] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1612.03238arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \nJournal reference:| Journal of Aerospace Engineering 26.2, 18-29 (2013)  \nRelated DOI:| https://doi.org/10.1061/%28ASCE%29AS.1943-5525.0000236DOI(s)\nlinking to related resources  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Philip Metzger [view email] [v1] Sat, 10 Dec 2016 02:30:24 UTC (801 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Affordable, Rapid Bootstrapping of the Space\nIndustry and Solar System Civilization, by Philip T.
