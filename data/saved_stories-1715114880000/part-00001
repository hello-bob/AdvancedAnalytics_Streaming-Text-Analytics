The announcement was\napparently unexpected, since Bluesky still listed him as a board member until\nlate on Sunday evening.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely thank Jack for his help funding and initiating the Bluesky\nproject,\u201d it posted. \u201cToday, Bluesky is thriving as an open source social\nnetwork running on atproto, the decentralized protocol we have built.\u201d\n\nFounded by Dorsey in 2019, Bluesky began as an internal Twitter team tasked\nwith developing an open source infrastructure on which the entire platform\ncould shift. By 2022, however, the goal had changed and Bluesky was spun off\nas an independent team.\n\nDorsey was initially an active user and after Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter a\nwave of users joined Bluesky. In September, Dorsey deleted his Bluesky account\nentirely. On Saturday, he announced a donation of $5m (\u00a34m) to the crypto-\nadjacent social network Nostr, as part of a $21m donation from his #startsmall\ncharity.\n\nDorsey\u2019s bio on X only contains his \u201cpublic key\u201d for Nostr, the unreadable\nstring of characters that allows the social network to operate in a fully\ndecentralised manner. Earlier on Saturday, he unfollowed all but three\naccounts on X: Edward Snowden, Stella Assange, the wife the WikiLeaks founder\nJulian, and Musk.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t depend on corporations to grant you rights,\u201d Dorsey tweeted. \u201cDefend\nthem yourself using freedom technology. (you\u2019re on one).\u201d Despite his\npromotion of alternatives to the site he founded, Dorsey has publicly shared\nhis admiration for Musk. In 2022, he called the multibillionaire the \u201csingular\nsolution I trust\u201d for the future of Twitter, though a year later he criticised\nMusk for his \u201cfairly reckless\u201d moves after taking control of the site.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to TechScape\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAlex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.
