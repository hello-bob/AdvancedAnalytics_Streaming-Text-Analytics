He had been struck by the huge amounts of H5N1 virus he\u2019d seen in milk\nfrom cows infected with the bird flu and thought that at least some virus was\ngetting off of farms and going downstream \u2014 onto store shelves.\n\nHe knew the Food and Drug Administration was working on its own national\nsurvey of the milk supply. But he was impatient. So he and a graduate student\nwent on a road trip: They collected 150 commercial milk products from around\nthe Midwest, representing dairy processing plants in 10 different states,\nincluding some where herds have tested positive for H5N1. Genetic testing\nfound viral RNA in 58 samples, he told STAT.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe researchers expect additional lab studies currently underway to show that\nthose samples don\u2019t contain live virus with the capability to cause human\ninfections, meaning that the risk of pasteurized milk to consumer health is\nstill very low. But the prevalence of viral genetic material in the products\nthey sampled suggest that the H5N1 outbreak is likely far more widespread in\ndairy cows than official counts indicate. So far, the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture has reported 33 herds in eight states have tested positive for\nH5N1.\n\n\u201cThe fact that you can go into a supermarket and 30% to 40% of those samples\ntest positive, that suggests there\u2019s more of the virus around than is\ncurrently being recognized,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who\nhas been analyzing the samples at St. Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital in\nMemphis, Tenn., where he heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the\nEcology of Influenza in Animals.\n\nEarlier this week, the FDA announced that its effort had found evidence of the\nH5N1 virus in samples of milk purchased from store shelves, but it provided no\ndetailed results. On Thursday, during an online symposium hosted by the\nAssociation of State and Territorial Health Officials, the FDA disclosed a\nhigh-level readout from the agency\u2019s investigation. Results returned Thursday\nmorning showed PCR-positive milk in 20% of samples, \u201cmaybe with some\npreponderance for areas with known herds,\u201d said Donald Prater, acting director\nof the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. He did not say how\nmany samples the FDA had analyzed or from what geographic area.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe testing by PCR \u2014 polymerase chain reaction \u2014 turned up only genetic traces\nof the virus, not evidence that it\u2019s alive or infectious. The FDA has been\nadamant that H5N1, which is heat-sensitive, is very likely killed through the\nprocess of pasteurization.\n\nThe agency is still assessing those samples for viral viability by attempting\nto grow virus from milk found to contain RNA from H5N1. The FDA plans to\nrelease results of those studies in the coming days. On Wednesday, Jeanne\nMarrazzo, the new director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases, told reporters that a team of NIAID-funded researchers had early\ndata to suggest that pasteurization does appear to be effective.\n\nThe team that produced that data \u2014 the St. Jude and OSU groups \u2014 told STAT\nthat it has so far analyzed four samples of store-bought milk that had tested\npositive via PCR for H5N1 genetic material. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the viral growth\nassays to see if we can recover any virus from them and we can\u2019t,\u201d Webby said.\n\nThose four samples came from an initial collection of 22 commercial milk\nproducts purchased in the Columbus, Ohio, area. \u201cIt was basically just me\nhitting up the five grocery stores between campus and my house,\u201d said Bowman.\n\nFurther reading\n\n## Deeper look: H5N1 bird flu\n\n  * Genetic analysis suggests the H5N1 flu virus outbreak in cows likely started earlier than originally thought.\n  * Video explainer: Traces of the avian flu virus have been found in grocery store milk. Here's what we know about pasteurization, the H5N1 virus, and consumer safety.\n  * In a widespread bird flu pandemic, could the U.S. produce enough H5N1 vaccine to protect the entire population? A look at lessons in preparedness from Covid-19.\n  * STAT First Opinion essay: Humans have no natural immunity to the H5N1 virus. The discovery of avian flu in U.S. cattle is a wake-up call to action.\n\nPCR testing at OSU revealed three of those 22 products to be positive for\nviral RNA. Bowman sent them to Webby to inject into plates of mammalian cells\nand embryonated chicken eggs and look for any signs of active viral\nreplication. In order to do that, Webby needed a negative control, so he went\nand bought milk at a store near his lab in Memphis. But PCR testing found H5N1\nRNA in that sample too, making it useless as a negative control, but an\nadditional data point showing a lack of live virus.\n\nThat sample is still in Webby\u2019s fridge at home. He used it to make dinner\nearlier this week. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about it all,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the risk of infection from dairy products is very low, the worry is\nthat the wider H5N1 spreads in cows, the more opportunities the virus has to\nadapt to transmit efficiently in mammalian hosts. It also increase the chances\nH5N1 could get into pigs, where it could swap genes and form hybrids with\nother flu viruses. Viruses that mutate to be able to spread easily through one\nspecies of mammals could find it easier to infect people.\n\nThe St. Jude group is now repeating its analyses with the additional samples\nBowman and his graduate student bought around the Midwest. Their early\nfindings provide further evidence that H5N1 is spreading broadly among dairy\ncows in the U.S.\n\nThis week, researchers examining viral genome sequences released Sunday by the\nUSDA found that the outbreak has likely been underway for months longer than\npreviously known. \u201cBoth of these data \u2014 the milk data and the genetic data\nthat shows this has been around since December of last year \u2014 suggests that\nthe outbreak is probably much bigger than we know,\u201d said Angie Rasmussen, a\nvirologist who studies emerging zoonotic pathogens at the Vaccine and\nInfectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.\n\nIt may also signal that herds can be infectious with only mild symptoms or no\nsymptoms at all, which would complicate the response and make containment much\nmore difficult.\n\n\u201cThis is telling us that we\u2019re probably already seeing that milk from\nasymptomatically infected cows does have some virus in there,\u201d said Andrew\nPekosz, a molecular microbiologist who studies respiratory viruses at Johns\nHopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nSo far, there has been only one report of H5N1 infections in a cattle herd\nwith no symptoms \u2014 in North Carolina. But USDA officials have not disclosed\nfurther details beyond the fact that milk from infected but asymptomatic cows\nseems unchanged.\n\n## Related: USDA orders H5N1 testing of some dairy cows to limit spread of\nbird flu\n\nIn H5N1-infected cows, the first thing that tends to happen is their appetite\ndisappears and their activity goes down. Then their milk production dries up.\nIn some animals, the milk they do produce turns yellow and thick. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd\nthing that seems to be unique to this particular virus,\u201d said Keith Poulsen,\ndirector of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. And it\u2019s one of\nthe chief red flags that dairy farmers are supposed to be on the lookout for\nwhen deciding whether to test their herds. If milk from asymptomatic or pre-\nsymptomatic cows looks normal but can carry virus, it would obscure the need\nfor testing.\n\nTo really understand the scale of spread as well as possible mechanisms of\nviral transmission, it\u2019s necessary to conduct widespread testing of animals\nwith and without symptoms, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director\nof Brown University\u2019s Pandemic Center. \u201cIf we\u2019re only testing cows with\noutward symptoms, we\u2019re missing infections in those without.\u201d\n\nUp until this week, USDA policy did not require testing of any animals, and\nonly recommended it for dairy cows greater than 3 years of age that have been\nlactating for at least 150 days and are showing severe clinical symptoms like\nfever, lethargy, abnormal milk production, and loose stool.\n\nOn Wednesday, the agency issued a federal order requiring an animal to test\nnegative for the virus before it can be transported across state lines. It\nalso requires laboratories and state veterinarians to report to the USDA any\nanimals that have tested positive for H5N1 or any other influenza A virus. But\noutside of interstate travel, testing remains voluntary and encouraged only\nfor visibly ill animals.\n\nPublic health experts told STAT that such narrow testing criteria are likely\ndistorting the true extent of the outbreak. \u201cI have not seen evidence that\nmakes me want to discard the fear that testing practices are absolutely\nshaping what we think we know about this virus,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t\nhave the right data right now to tell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nThe situation is reminiscent, she said, of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the early\nweeks of that outbreak, testing policies were narrow \u2014 limited to symptomatic\nindividuals who had traveled to China. Meanwhile, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was\nspreading undetected throughout the U.S., as genomic analyses would later\nshow. Later, when at-home tests became widely available, official counts\nbecame unreliable, leaving state and local health departments in the dark.\n\n\u201cAt least with Covid, wastewater surveillance eventually kicked in to\nsupplement our picture,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cWith H5N1, we don\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is\nexploring wastewater testing for H5N1, but noted significant hurdles,\nincluding farms not being linked to municipal wastewater systems and the\npotential for infected wild birds to confound testing of water around farms.\n\nRequiring dairy farms to regularly test all their animals, including\nasymptomatic ones, is not logistically feasible given the current capacity of\nstate veterinary diagnostic laboratories, Poulsen said. He and other lab\ndirectors are already bracing for the massive ramp-up in testing they expect\nto begin when the USDA order goes into effect Monday. But he does think more\nhas to be done at the federal level to encourage farmers to test their herds.\n\n\u201cAt this point, farms just aren\u2019t volunteering samples because they don\u2019t have\nany incentives to raise their hand,\u201d Poulsen said. That information blackout\nmakes it much more challenging for epidemiologists to trace the virus and\nunderstand how it\u2019s spreading, the exact mechanisms of which are still\nunclear.\n\n\u201cWe need to do what we can now to understand it and contain it so it doesn\u2019t\nturn into a pathogen of pandemic potential,\u201d Poulsen said. \u201cThat is a real\nrisk if we continue to ignore it.\u201d\n\n## About the Author Reprints\n\n### Megan Molteni\n\nScience Writer\n\nMegan Molteni reports on discoveries from the frontiers of genomic medicine,\nneuroscience, and reproductive tech.
