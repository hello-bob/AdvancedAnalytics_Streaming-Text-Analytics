The repurposed vessel is now a de facto\naircraft carrier, capable of hosting up to a dozen American-built F-35 fighter\njets.\n\nThe symbolism, for those alive to it, was rich. The original Kaga led the\nImperial Japanese Navy fleet that attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, drawing the\nUnited States into the second World War. The conflict in the Pacific theatre\nclimaxed with the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki four years later.\n\nKure was also where Japan\u2019s naval ambitions ended in a watery graveyard, with\nthe sinking of the Amagi warship in a US air raid in 1945. Kaga\u2019s sister ship,\nthe Izumo, is also being upgraded to become the first Japanese naval vessel to\noperate fixed-wing aircraft since the war.\n\nJapan\u2019s \u201cpacifist\u201d constitution, written by occupying US forces amid the ruins\nof that conflict, still nominally bans it from settling disputes by war, but\nlast week prime minister Fumio Kishida gave his clearest signal yet that the\npostwar era is over.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n## Scholz visits Beijing but tensions simmer on Russia and Gaza\n\n## \u2018We\u2019re doing everything to keep bringing up the coal\u2019: Ukrainian miners\ndefy Russia\u2019s advance in the east\n\n## \u2018Why me?\u2019: Liz Truss shares reaction to death of queen on her second day as\nPM in new book\n\n## Strange Manhattan homecoming for Trump, first former US president to face a\ncriminal trial\n\nIn a speech to US legislators, Kishida said Japan was ready to help America\nshoulder the burden of protecting the \u201cfree world\u201d. Japan, he said, stood with\nits ally on a ship called \u201cFreedom and Democracy\u201d and was \u201cproud to be your\nshipmate\u201d.\n\n\u201cI detect an undercurrent of self-doubt among some Americans about what your\nrole in the world should be,\u201d Kishida told a joint session of Congress.\n\n\u201cThis self-doubt is arising at a time when our world is at history\u2019s turning\npoint. The post-cold war era is already behind us, and we are now at an\ninflection point that will define the next stage of human history,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are on deck, we are on task. And we are ready to do what is necessary. I\nam here to say that Japan is already standing shoulder to shoulder with the\nUnited States. You are not alone. We are with you.\u201d\n\nKishida\u2019s speech capped what US ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel recently\ncalled an era of \u201cprofound transition and transformation\u201d in Japan\u2019s military\nposture.\n\n\u201cDriven by a proliferation of existential threats,\u201d Emanuel said, in a\nreference to China and Russia, Tokyo had committed to doubling its defence\nbudget to 2 per cent of GDP in 2027.\n\nThat not only put it ahead of many Nato countries, he pointed out; it would\ngive Japan the \u201cthird-largest defence budget in the world after the US and\nChina\u201d.\n\nThis year, the joint command of Japan\u2019s Self-Defence Forces and the US\nmilitary for the first time named China as a hypothetical enemy.\n\nIn another first, Japan sent military equipment to a nation in conflict:\nUkraine. And it has eased its principles on defence equipment transfer by\nselling back American-designed Patriot missiles to the US.\n\n\u201cNobody ever imagined\u201d such profound changes were possible, said Emanuel. \u201cIn\nfact, everyone predicted the opposite.\u201d\n\nNot everyone welcomes these changes. Driven by mutual distrust, Japan, China\nand the United States are driving an arms race in Asia that risks spinning out\nof control, warns CNN.\n\n\u201cThree major nuclear powers and one fast-developing one, the world\u2019s three\nbiggest economies and decades-old alliances all vying for an edge in some of\nthe world\u2019s most contested land and sea areas,\u201d wrote analyst Brad Lendon.\n\nYet, the chorus of voices pushing Japan to scrap what the nation\u2019s most-read\nnewspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, called its \u201centirely impractical, utopian\npacifism\u201d is growing.\n\nIn this context, the significance of the retooled Kaga and Izumo is important.\nAircraft carriers, unlike helicopter carriers (their previous incarnation),\nimply force projection beyond Japan\u2019s shores.\n\nThe \u201cgame-changer\u201d has been Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, said the Yomiuri\nopinion piece.\n\n\u201cJapan has thus far handled its security and defence policies as if fighting\nwith one hand tied behind its back. This approach would have been acceptable\nif the Japanese economy continued its high growth and the United States was\noverwhelmingly powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat time is behind us.\u201d\n\nJapanChina\n\n##### IN THIS SECTION\n\n## Olaf Scholz asks Chinese president to promote end to Russian war on Ukraine\n\n## Scholz visits Beijing but tensions simmer on Russia and Gaza\n\n## Tokyo Letter: \u2018Pacifist\u2019 Japan is tooling up for war\n\n## Sydney attack: Irish man among those caught up in \u2018panic\u2019 as six killed in\nshopping centre stabbings\n\n## Japan\u2019s native population declines at record rate as births plunge\n\n##### MOST READ\n\n## Retired shop assistant hit for \u20ac74,727 excise bill for unmarked diesel\n\n## Gifting to your children?
