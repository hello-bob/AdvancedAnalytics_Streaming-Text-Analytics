They\u2019re too slow to act on this\n  2. They won\u2019t focus on this particular problem\n\nThe first one depends on the company\u2019s size and how many levels of hierarchy\nthey have. Bigger companies tend to move slower.\n\nThe second one - you can predict with decent accuracy based on OpenAI\u2019s main\nfocus areas and priorities.\n\nSome ideas will get crushed by OpenAI\u2019s advancements. Others may actually\nbenefit from them.\n\nYou definitely don\u2019t want to be in the \u201cget crushed\u201d group.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nImagine OpenAI is creating a new programming language (like C++) - instead of\nAI models.\n\nAnd you run a company for booking flight tickets. Your whole app is built in\nC++.\n\nWould improvements to C++ kill your business? Probably not.\n\nBut why wouldn\u2019t OpenAI just add a flight booking system to their programming\nlanguage?\n\nThe main reason: OpenAI can make more money serving general use cases - like a\nversatile programming language. Not niche applications.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they won\u2019t do it. They simply can\u2019t build every possible\napplication.\n\nJust like the creators of C++ didn\u2019t (and couldn\u2019t) develop all the money-\nmaking C++ software we have today.\n\nThe context needed for each piece of software is held by the company laser-\nfocused on that specific problem.\n\nSimilarly, the context you have about your business - even if it\u2019s just built\non top of OpenAI\u2019s models - is your unique application.\n\nOpenAI is the versatile tool, like C++. Your business is a specific use-case\nbuilt on that tool.\n\nThe context you provide \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d is your product. Products are all\nabout convenience - like saving users from typing long prompts. People will\npay for that.\n\nFor example: You could make a website that uses OpenAI to write human-sounding\nemails. People would probably pay for that convenience.\n\nBut some ideas directly clash with OpenAI\u2019s path. Unfortunately, these tend to\ninvolve hard engineering problems :(\n\nIf you\u2019re selling enterprises a C++ module for binary search - you\u2019ll probably\nget replaced by the next C++ release.\n\nSimilarly, if you\u2019re making a background removal tool or text-to-image\ngenerator - you\u2019re probably clashing with OpenAI\u2019s path.\n\nIn cases like that, you can only compete on output quality compared to OpenAI.\nEvaluate how your strategy, data, and resources stack up against OpenAI\u2019s.\n\nOn the other hand: If you\u2019re building an anime movie maker using Sora - OpenAI\nmay never directly compete with you.\n\nCreating anime requires heavily prompting the AI in very specific ways. That\nheavy prompting is your product.\n\nThere\u2019s no shame in being a \u201cwrapper\u201d on top of AI models. We were all just\nwrapping C++ libraries and no one realized it.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
