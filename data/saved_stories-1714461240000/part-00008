Alongside the\nUK\u2019s stagnant wage growth, there is one big issue that will face the next\ngovernment: the rises in economic inactivity and health-related benefit\nclaims. Real pay growth, unemployment and vacancies have all returned roughly\nto 2019 rates. But there is one aspect of the labour market that remains far\nfrom normal: the UK employment rate is still lower than pre-pandemic, with\neconomic inactivity up from 20.5 per cent to 21.8 per cent, equivalent to\n700,000 people. And the continued rise shows little sign of slowing as the\npandemic recedes. The UK is the only G7 country with a lower employment rate\nthan before the pandemic.\n\nThis rise in economic inactivity has been U-shaped by age: those aged 16-24\nand 50-64 account for nine-tenths of the rise in economic inactivity among\nworking-age adults since the end of 2019. And while there are more young\npeople who are economically inactive and in full-time education (up 160,000,\nor 15 per cent, in the past year), it is the rise in economic inactivity due\nto long-term sickness that stands out. The number of working-age adults who\nare economically inactive due to long-term sickness has been growing for over\nfour years and stood at 2.7 million in November-January 2024, having peaked at\na record-high 2.8 million a couple of months earlier.\n\nThese developments are concerning, first and foremost for the 2.7 million\npeople whose health and living standards are affected. But it is also a worry\nfor the Treasury, with claims for illness- and disability-related benefits\nrising fast. By December 2023, almost a third of people in receipt of\nUniversal Credit (UC) had a health condition or disability that affected their\nability to work, and again the pattern is U-shaped by age. More than half of\nclaimants in their late fifties and sixties have a health condition or\ndisability reflected in their UC award. But UC claimants in their early\ntwenties are more likely than those in their thirties or early forties to have\na health condition or disability that restricts their ability to work, and it\nis among young adults that health-related UC awards have increased most\nsignificantly in recent years.\n\nBut it is the rising number of claims for PIP \u2013 the main non-means-tested\nbenefit for those with health conditions or disabilities \u2013 that is most\nstriking. Among working-age adults in England and Wales, new claims for PIP\nhave increased by two-thirds (68 per cent) between early 2020 and early 2024.\nOnce again, it is those at each end of the age distribution who stand out.\nOlder adults aged 55-64 are the age group most likely to claim PIP, but among\nyoung people, the rise in PIP claims in recent years has been most pronounced.\nThe number of new PIP claims in England and Wales is up 138 per cent for\n16-17-year-olds, and up 77 per cent for 18-24-year-olds.\n\nHigh economic inactivity remains the labour market legacy of the Covid-19\npandemic\n\nIn many aspects, the UK labour market looks a lot like it did before the\nCovid-19 pandemic. After a rollercoaster four years, real pay growth reached\n1.8 per cent in the most recent data for January 2024 \u2013 this is only slightly\nabove real pay growth in 2019, which averaged 1.7 per cent. There is a similar\ntrend when we look at vacancies: after peaking at 4.0 per cent, the vacancy\nrate has fallen back to 2.7 per cent, only slightly higher than the 2019\naverage of 2.5 per cent. And unemployment remains low, at just 3.9 per cent \u2013\nthis is the same as the average rate in 2019.\n\nBut one aspect of the labour market looks far from normal. The working-age\nemployment rate in the UK is still well below where it was before the Covid-19\npandemic, down from 76.2 per cent to 75.0 per cent. Not only does this reverse\nthe trend experienced in the UK in the 2010s (when the employment rate was\nrising consistently), it also sets the UK apart from its neighbours. As Figure\n1 shows, the UK is the only G7 nation where the employment rate has not\nreached its pre-pandemic level. In fact, most G7 countries have seen their\nemployment rate surpass its pre-pandemic level: on average across the G7, the\nworking-age employment rate is up by 0.8 percentage points. As a result, the\nUK has fallen from having the second-highest employment rate in the G7 in 2019\nQ4 to having the fourth-highest employment rate in 2023 Q2, with Germany and\nCanada rising into second and third place. Looking at the OECD more widely,\nthe UK has slipped from an impressive sixth place down to thirteenth place.\n\nFigure 1: The UK is the only G7 country with an employment rate that is lower\nthan before the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nAnd it is high economic inactivity \u2013 not high unemployment \u2013 that explains the\nUK\u2019s lower employment rate. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the\noverall size of the UK working-age population has increased by 700,000, a rise\nof 2 per cent. Economic inactivity has risen at a faster rate, with the number\nof working-age people who are economically inactive increasing from 8.6\nmillion to 9.3 million between December-February 2020 and November-January\n2024, a rise of 700,000 or 8 per cent. On the other hand, the number of\nworking-age people in employment and unemployment is near-identical to that on\neve of the pandemic (with employment rising, and unemployment falling, by just\n30,000).i This is shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: The legacy of the Covid-19 pandemic is high economic inactivity\n\nThe good news: there has been a rise in the number of young people who are in\nfull-time education\n\nThis rise in economic inactivity has been U-shaped: younger adults aged 16-24\nand older adults aged 50-64 account for nine-tenths (90 per cent) of the rise\nin economic inactivity among working-age adults since the start of the\npandemic. Indeed, economic inactivity among adults aged 25-49 has remained\nalmost unchanged since the start of the pandemic, with one good news story\nresulting from the pandemic being the increase in labour force participation\namong women in mid-life.\n\nWhile there was concern about a frenzy of early retirement \u2013 with the number\nof older adults leaving employment into economic inactivity due to retirement\npicking up in 2021 \u2013 this does not seem to have turned into a significant\nlasting development. The number of working-age adults who are economically\ninactive due to retirement has remained relatively stable over the past year\nand a half, reaching 1.1 million in November-January 2024. And although data\nreweighting issues mean that we cannot directly compare recent data on reasons\nfor economic inactivity to data from June-August 2022 or before, we can be\nsure that economic inactivity due to retirement is still well below the peaks\nseen in the early 2010s.\n\nTurning to young people, it is important to remember that not all forms of\neconomic inactivity should be viewed as concerning. As Figure 3 shows, there\nhas been a sizeable increase in the number of young people aged 18-24 who are\neconomically inactive and in full-time education (up 160,000, or 15 per cent,\nin the past year, to reach 1.2 million in November-January 2024). This means\nthat 87 per cent of the total rise in economic inactivity among young people\naged 18-24 over the past 12 months has been among young people in full-time\neducation.\n\nFigure 3: The number of young people who are economically inactive is well\nabove pre-pandemic levels \u2013 and this is true among students and non-students\n\nAlthough this rise in economic inactivity among young people in full-time\neducation largely reflects a rising student population, it is also worth\nnoting that the make-up of young students has also shifted slightly over the\npast year. By November-January 2024, 64 per cent of young people in full-time\neducation were economically inactive \u2013 this is the highest proportion on\nrecord, and up from 59 per cent one year earlier.\n\nThe bad news: there are 2.7 million working-age adults out of work due to ill\nhealth, and the rise shows little sign of slowing\n\nBut while economic inactivity due to retirement is important among older\nadults and economic inactivity among those in full-time education important to\nyounger adults, it is economic inactivity due to long-term sickness that\nstands out across the age distribution. There were 2.7 million working-age\nadults economically inactive due to long-term sickness in November-January\n2024, with this number peaking at a record-high of 2.8 million a couple of\nmonths earlier in September-November 2023. This is shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: Economic inactivity due to ill health has now been rising for five\nyears \u2013 this is the longest sustained rise since the 1990s\n\nIndeed, as is indicated by the shaded areas in Figure 4, economic inactivity\ndue to long-term sickness has been rising consistently on an annual basis for\nthe past four-and-a-half years since the summer of 2019 (before the Covid-19\npandemic). ii This is the second-longest sustained rise in sickness-related\ninactivity on record, and is only one month shorter than the longest rise,\nseen between 1994-1998. The consistency of this rise is what will worry\npolicymakers (and Treasury officials) the most: it does not appear to be a\nshort-term, Covid-19-related, blip. And the trend is even more noteworthy\nsince it stands in stark contrast to those seen in the 2000s and 2010s, when\neconomic inactivity due to long-term sickness was consistently trending down.\n\nThere has also been a rapid rise in the number of working-age adults claiming\nsickness- and disability-related benefits.\n\nWith the number of working-age people who are not working due to ill health\nreaching record highs in recent months, questions have arisen about the knock-\non impact on claims for out-of-work benefits. The gradual rollout of Universal\nCredit (UC) and phasing out of \u2018legacy benefits\u2019 such as Employment and\nSupport Allowance (ESA) makes it difficult to compare out-of-work benefit\ncaseloads over time.iii But it is clear that a rising proportion of UC\nclaimants have work-limiting health conditions or disabilities, with almost a\nthird (31 per cent) of people in receipt of UC being on UC health in December\n2023, up 4 percentage points compared to a year earlier. iv\n\nFor the first time, the DWP has published data on the medical conditions\nrecorded during Work Capability Assessments for UC (the assessment used to\ndetermine whether someone is deemed to have a health condition or disability\nthat affects their ability to work). The prevalence of mental health problems\nis striking: of all Work Capability Assessment decisions between January 2022\nand November 2023, more than two-thirds (69 per cent) recorded mental and\nbehavioural disorders. The next most common medical condition to be recorded\nis diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue, with this\nbeing recorded in almost half (48 per cent) of Work Capability Assessment\ndecisions in the time period.\n\nAs Figure 5 shows, the proportion of UC claimants who are on UC health has\nrisen among claimants of all ages over the past four years. But once again, we\nsee a U-shaped pattern. It is the youngest and oldest claimants who are most\nlikely to be on UC health, and who have seen the biggest increases between\n2019 and 2023. By December 2023, young UC claimants in their early twenties\nwere more likely to be in receipt of UC health than UC claimants in their\nthirties and early forties. And the proportion of 18-24-year-old UC claimants\nin receipt of UC health increased by 12 percentage points between December\n2019 and 2023, from an average of 17 per cent to 29 per cent. This is a bigger\nchange than has been seen among any other age group. And although there have\nbeen compositional changes to the UC health caseload between 2019 and 2023 (as\nmore claimants move from ESA onto UC), the impact of these will be smallest\namong young people in their late teens and early twenties who are unlikely to\nbe old enough to have previously been in receipt of ESA. Finally, it is worth\nemphasising just how many older UC claimants have health problems or\ndisability: by December 2023, more than half of claimants aged 58 and above\nwere in receipt of UC health.\n\nFigure 5: There is a U-shaped pattern in Universal Credit health claims by age\n\nAlthough the UC health statistics show a marked rise in the proportion of UC\nclaimants with work-limiting health conditions, it is the rising number of new\nclaims for PIP (the main non-means-tested benefit for those with health\nconditions or disabilities) that will be of greatest concern to policy makers.\nAmong 16-64-year-olds in England and Wales, new claims for PIP increased by\ntwo-thirds (68 per cent) between November-January 2020 (on the eve of the\npandemic) and November-January 2024. And once again, this doesn\u2019t appear to be\na time-limited Covid-19 shock: more recently, between November-January 2023\nand November-January 2024, new claims among 16-64-year-olds in England and\nWales increased by 14 per cent.\n\nAs Figure 6 shows, trends among the youngest and oldest claimants stand out.\nAmong 16-17-year-olds in England and Wales, new claims have risen dramatically\nfrom a low starting point, up 138 per cent in the past four years. But the\nnumber of new claims is highest among older adults aged 55-64, with 53,000 new\nclaims for PIP being recorded in November-January 2024, up from 33,000 in the\nsame period four years earlier. Put differently, adults aged 55-64 accounted\nfor a quarter (26 per cent) of new claims for PIP among working-age adults in\nEngland and Wales between November-January 2024.\n\nFigure 6: PIP claims have risen sharply since the start of the pandemic, and\nthis is especially true among younger people\n\nIf we once again look back at the experience in the 1990s, we can see that the\nrise in economic inactivity due to long-term sickness was followed by\nsignificant changes to the benefits system (most notably the introduction of\nIncapacity Benefit in 1995), rather than significant action to improve the\nhealth of the population.v In the 2020s, reform is already underway, with the\nGovernment due to amend the Work Capability Assessment from 2025 onwards (to\nmake it harder for some claimants with health conditions relating to their\nmobility or mental health to receive additional support), and they have\nannounced longer-term plans to scrap the Work Capability Assessment entirely.\nWe should not be surprised if further fiscally-driven welfare reforms are\nannounced. But the important lesson to learn from the 1990s is that the\nhealth-related benefits system does not exist in a vacuum: for example, in the\n1990s, job losses stemming from deindustrialisation did not result in a major\nuptick in unemployment, but instead manifested as economic inactivity due to\nlong-term sickness. In the 2020s, we should be wary about having an\nincreasingly strict unemployment benefits system (where claimants are subject\nto high levels of benefit conditionality), since this may be acting to\nencourage more people to claim health-related benefits instead.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn an election year, jobs and social security often take centre stage. As well\nas addressing the UK\u2019s stagnant wage growth, the next government will be\ntasked with tackling high levels of economic inactivity due to long-term\nsickness and the simultaneous rise in benefit claims. This ongoing trend is\nhaving real impacts on the economy: high and rising rates of economic\ninactivity due to ill health were factored into the latest OBR growth\nprojection, and spending on disability benefits is set to rise by 45 per cent\nin nominal terms between 2023-24 and 2028-29.\n\nThe U-shaped nature of this problem is especially worrying. Any spell out of\nwork due to ill health can be damaging to an individual\u2019s well-being and\nliving standards, but the risks are even greater for young people at the start\nof their working lives. But we should also worry about older adults spending\ntheir later years in poor health and on a low income, particularly given the\nUK\u2019s demographic profile. If we fail to address this problem soon, it is\nlikely to result in even higher costs in the future.\n\n#### Further reading\n\nFirm foundations\n\nUnderstanding why employers use flexible contracts\n\n25 April 2024\n\n\u00b7\n\nHannah Slaughter\n\nLabour Market Outlook Q2 2024\n\nHappy 25th birthday to the minimum wage\n\n27 March 2024\n\n\u00b7\n\nNye Cominetti, Hannah Slaughter\n\nA U-shaped legacy\n\nTaking stock of trends in economic inactivity in 2024\n\n23 March 2024\n\n\u00b7\n\nLouise Murphy\n\nLouise Murphy Senior Economist\n\n  * Our work\n  * Publications\n  * Media\n  * Comment\n  * About us\n  * Events\n\n2 Queen Anne\u2019s Gate, London SW1H 9AA\n\nE:info@resolutionfoundation.org T:020 3372 2960 To contact the press office:\nT:0203 372 2968\n\nCompany Number: 5588883 Charity Number: 1114839\n\nPrivacy Policy \u00a9 The Resolution Foundation 2024\n\nBack to top\n\n#### Mailing list\n\nBe the first to hear about our events, or receive our weekly round-up of\npolitical economic research\n\n", "frontpage": false}
