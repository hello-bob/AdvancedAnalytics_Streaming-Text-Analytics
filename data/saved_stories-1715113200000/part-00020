The innovative good global citizen, adding to\nthe storehouse of knowledge while making better products and services? Or the\nautocracy, determined to advance the interests of the leadership through any\nand all means, untrammeled by legal safeguards within its borders and,\nwherever possible, outside them?\n\nThis week, we saw both sides on the same day. They cannot both be true, even\nif on the face of things they look compatible.\n\nGood China first. Alibaba Cloud researchers, in conjunction with South Korean\nowned Solidisk, presented a paper at a conference about making cloud servers\nwork better. Only flashy because it uses flash memory, it's a deep-in-the-\nstack storage caching scheme that doubles how many VMs can run on a server.\nThe paper sets out clearly what the problems are, how they're fixed, and what\nresults were found. The idea is in production and there's an open source\nimplementation if you want to give it a go.\n\nThis is a model of how corporate research can and should be shared. If its\nclaims are accurate \u2013 taken at face value, like all unreviewed research \u2013 then\nAlibaba Cloud gains status for its products and its researchers, more SSDs\nwill be sold, and everyone gets cheaper, faster cloudiness. If it doesn't\nwork, or has more limited applications than at first appear, little has been\nlost \u2013 you are free to make of it what you will. Plus, new thinking about data\ncaching at scale is always welcome. Who knows what ideas might spark off.\n\nLet's move on to Bad China. On the same day as Alibaba Cloud's story, an\nAustralian think tank published a warning that Beijing is helping itself to\nhuge amounts of behavioral and other user data from the country's big tech\nfirms. This data is being used at scale to improve state propaganda and\ndisinformation, primary tools in the control of its own citizens and the\ninfluencing of those elsewhere. You won't find any Chinese researchers writing\nthis up for publication, but the control the Chinese Communist Party exerts\nover all commercial operations is deep rooted and well documented.\n\nThe report itself [PDF] goes into the legal, structural and evidential details\nbehind its conclusion, but one underlying fact is that the Chinese state can\ndo what it likes with Chinese businesses, without limitation, and they can do\nnothing to protect themselves. It doesn't even matter if you are the CEO of an\noutfit that follows the rules; if you get too powerful or make the wrong\nfriends you can be vanished. It's not a matter of whether or not the CCP is\nmaking maximum use of its powers. Why on earth would it not?\n\nThe only sane response as an individual, company or a state is to avoid as\nmuch Chinese tech as possible, especially if it can collect data. It's not\njust the great wash of personal data that's fuel to the boiler of Chinese\npolicy, it would be astonishingly foolish for any sensitive data to touch\nproducts or services under the control of the Chinese state - which is to say,\nall of them.\n\nThis is a very hard line to take, and many look for reasons to reject it. One\nof the most pernicious excuses is \"the West is just as bad,\" citing the Five\nEyes intelligence sharing agreement between the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and\nNew Zealand, or the predatory data sins of our own dastardly Big Tech.\n\nThere is one point of true equivalence between the West and China here:\neveryone involved operates at the limits of their powers to pursue their aims.\nThe difference is, with China those limits don't exist. Elsewhere, they do,\nthey matter and we pretend otherwise at our peril. Like China, there is a Good\nWest and a Bad West: unlike China, we still get to choose.\n\n  * EU duties might not be enough to hold off flood of Chinese EVs\n  * Chinese government website security is often worryingly bad, say Chinese researchers\n  * Microsoft continues multibillion-dollar cloud and AI sprinkle in Malaysia\n  * China to launch sample return mission to the far side of the Moon \u2013 maybe next week\n\nWhich is not to say that powerful Western entities never overstep their legal\nlimits. History is brimming with bad behavior by spies and suits - when they\nthink they can get away with it. It is hard to rein them in, but we do it,\nagain and again. They can be embarrassed, they can be taken to court, they can\nbe brought to heel. If you are a citizen of a democratic nation, you can blow\nthe doors off. Pretending you can't, so it doesn't matter, is a wonderful way\nto avoid the responsibility of actually doing something. It is also highly\ndangerous, especially if discrediting democracy is a primary aim of powerful\nadversaries.\n\nWe in tech are right at the front line. We understand what can happen and what\nis happening. We cannot pretend not to know the why. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Analytics\n  * China\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Analytics\n  * China\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * JD.com\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Programming\n\n#### More about\n\n6 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Analytics\n  * China\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Analytics\n  * China\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * JD.com\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Programming\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### China 'the most competitive market in the world' for the iPhone says Tim\nCook\n\nPut another way, iPhone sales were down 8%\n\nPersonal Tech4 days | 16\n\n#### China's mega-telcos are spending billions on AI servers\n\nChina Mobile alone wants almost 8,000 machines\n\nSystems13 days | 8\n\n#### Tesla maps out new territory in China with Baidu deal\n\nU-turn necessary to comply with Chinese law\n\nPersonal Tech6 days | 10\n\n#### The next step up for high-impact identity authorization\n\nHow SSH Communications Security cuts through the hype around Zero Trust to\nsecure the connections that matter\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### EU duties might not be enough to hold off flood of Chinese EVs\n\n15 to 30% won't touch the sides... 50%?
