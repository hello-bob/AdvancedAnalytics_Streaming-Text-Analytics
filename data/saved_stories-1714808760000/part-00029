SIE explained that\naccount linking allows players to take advantage of \"safety and security\"\nprovided by PlayStation, as it can more easily protect folks from \"griefing\nand abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of\nbehavior.\"\n\nMany Steam players haven't responded well to the news. As of the time of\nwriting, over 2,500 negative user reviews have been submitted to the game's\nstorefront page today, blemishing an otherwise spotless \"Very Positive\"\nrating. Some reviews cite data harvesting and security concerns as potential\nworries. Others point to the fact that Sony waited months after launch to make\naccount linking mandatory.\n\nHow this affects players in regions that don't have access to the PlayStation\nNetwork is a bigger concern, though. In the Helldivers 2 Discord, community\nmanager Thomas 'Twinbeard' Petersson said they aren't yet sure what these rule\nchanges meant for players in areas without PSN access, which could be another\nfactor contributing to the negative downturn.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM gamesradar\n\nIt's worth noting that many Steam games force players to link to an external\naccount. For instance, multiplayer pirateventure Sea of Thieves asks players\nto link to an Xbox account, whether they're playing on PC or PS5, but the\nHelldivers 2 requirement coming months post-launch seems to have caught some\nplayers by surprise.\n\nElsewhere, Helldivers 2 players have discovered giant underground tunnels\nwhich could tease the return of the Hive Lords.\n\n## Sign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter\n\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nKaan Serin\n\nFreelance contributor\n\nKaan freelances for various websites including Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer,\nand this one, Gamesradar.
