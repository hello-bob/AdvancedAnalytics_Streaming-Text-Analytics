The\nproblem? We can\u2019t actually see the future.\n\nBut today we got our hands on LPCAMM2 for the first time, and this looks like\nthe future to us. LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable, upgradeable memory\nstandard for laptops, using the latest LPDDR chips for maximum speed and\nefficiency. So instead of overpaying (or under-speccing) based on guesswork\nabout your future memory needs, you\u2019ll hopefully be able to buy your next\nlaptop and then install more RAM as needed. Imagine that!\n\nWe say \u201chopefully\u201d because the laptop on our teardown table today is the first\nof its kind, thanks to a collaboration between Micron and Lenovo\u2014and it\nremains to be seen how many other big laptop makers will adopt LPCAMM2\ntechnology. But judging by the results of our initial hands-on, the writing is\non the wall for laptops with soldered-down, non-serviceable memory.\n\n## What is LPDDR, and why do manufacturers solder it down?\n\nRepairable, upgradeable RAM isn\u2019t exactly a new idea. As anyone who has ever\nbuilt a PC knows, we\u2019ve had swappable DDR RAM sticks (also known as DIMMs, or\nDual In-Line Memory Modules) since basically forever. From old Gateway towers\nto today\u2019s gaming powerhouses to zillion-dollar industrial servers,\nupgradeable and replaceable RAM is still very much a thing. And for many\nyears, the same was true of laptops, which used a slightly more compact\n(\u201cSmall-Outline\u201d DIMM, or SO-DIMM) version of those same RAM sticks.\n\nMore recently though, we\u2019ve seen increasing adoption of LPDDR\u2014a low-power\nflavor of RAM (hence the \u201cLP\u201d) developed for mobile devices like phones and\ntablets. Whereas conventional DDR RAM excels at performance applications where\npower consumption isn\u2019t a primary concern, like video editing or gaming, LPDDR\nwins the day when it comes to efficiency\u2014a.k.a. battery life. And so for\nlaptops in particular, the benefits of LPDDR are hard to beat.\n\nThe drawback of LPDDR, though, is that it has to be soldered to the main board\nin close proximity to the processor\u2014making repairs and upgrades completely\nimpractical. But why?\n\nLPDDR operates at lower voltages compared to DDR, giving it the edge in power\nefficiency. But, the lower voltage makes signal integrity between the memory\nand processor challenging, requiring tighter tolerances and shorter trace\ndistances\u2014that is, the farther the signal has to travel, the more voltage you\nneed for a reliable signal. This is why LPDDR is soldered down as close to the\nprocessor as possible.\n\nHistorically, LPDDR chips (left) had to be soldered very close to the main\nprocessor (right).\n\nIn short, laptop makers and consumers alike have faced an unfortunate dilemma:\nconventional SO-DIMM RAM for serviceability and upgradeability, or soldered\nLPDDR chips for longer battery life.\n\nToday, that changes.\n\n## Enter LPCAMM2\n\nStanding for \u201cLow-Power Compression-Attached Memory Module,\u201d the new tech is\nas the name suggests: LPDDR chips on a compact board that screws in place very\nclose to a laptop\u2019s CPU. Combining the efficiency and speed of LPDDR with a\nthin, lightweight, upgradeable design and a trick interface that gets\neverything up close and personal with the CPU, LPCAMM2 seemingly does it all.\nAnd with dual-channel performance already baked in, a single LPCAMM2 module\ncan do the job of a pair of the old socketed SO-DIMM sticks with a much\nsmaller footprint and better thermals to boot. Finally: modular, performant,\npower-efficient laptop memory for the masses.\n\nLenovo\u2019s ThinkPad P1 (Gen 7) is the first laptop you can actually buy that\nuses LPCAMM2 tech\u2014check out our repair guide.\n\nEven though LPCAMM2 is arriving initially from Micron, in a Lenovo product,\nthe technology owes its existence to an alliance of tech companies working\ntogether over the course of several years. The first iteration, known as CAMM,\nwas an in-house project at Dell, with the first DDR5-equipped CAMM modules\ninstalled in Dell Precision 7000 series laptops. And thankfully, after doing\nthe initial R&D to make the tech a reality, Dell didn\u2019t gatekeep. Their\nengineers believed that the project had such a good chance at becoming the\nnext widespread memory standard that instead of keeping it proprietary, they\nwent the other way and opened it up for standardization.\n\nThey were right. Only a few short years later, with the blessing of the JEDEC\nstandards body, LPCAMM2 is here and ready to take the torch.\n\nDell is one hero in this story, creating something the tech world sorely\nneeded and then sharing instead of keeping it for themselves. Thankfully, this\nstory is full of heroes: Micron and Lenovo are first to bring LPCAMM2 to\nmarket, with Samsung, ADATA, and others backing it as well. Instead of\neveryone going their own way, they\u2019ve rallied around a new industry\nstandard\u2014meaning an off-the-shelf LPCAMM2 module should theoretically work in\nany laptop that adopts the technology, regardless of who manufactures it. With\nthe industry as a whole on the same page, backing standards like this, the\nworld becomes a more repairable place.\n\n## Designing for a repairable future\n\nThe advent of LPCAMM2 is especially gratifying for repair advocates, who for\nyears have been told that repairability simply can\u2019t coexist with cutting-edge\ntech in thin-and-light devices. We\u2019re not ready to accept that, and we\u2019ve long\nargued that OEMs who are willing to innovate with repairability in mind can do\nbetter. Maybe we can\u2019t see the future, but we can envision one that\u2019s more\nrepairable than what we\u2019ve been sold in recent years\u2014and we\u2019re grateful when\ncompanies like Micron and Lenovo take the leap to make that future a reality.\n\nLPCAMM2 exemplifies our ability to advance technologically while designing\nwith sustainability in mind. It represents a significant step forward in the\nfight against planned obsolescence. By fighting for a modular, upgradeable\nmemory solution for chips previously stuck in a soldered hellscape,\nmanufacturers are demonstrating their commitment to creating devices that\nstand the test of time.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to gain here: from increasing device lifespan at schools and\nbusinesses, to reducing anxiety for consumers at the point of purchase, to\nenabling hassle-free repairs for devices that would otherwise be scrapped. As\nmore companies rally behind this standard, we can look forward to a future\nwhere more laptops are built to last, and where repairs and upgrades aren\u2019t\nonly possible, but encouraged. There\u2019s no question that the potential for this\ntechnology to make a tangible difference is real, and it\u2019s right in front of\nus.\n\nFull Disclosure: iFixit has prior business relationships with both Micron and\nLenovo, and we are hopelessly biased in favor of repairable products.\n\nRelated Stories\n\niFixit\n\n### iFixit and Lenovo Work Together to Make Laptop Repairability the Standard\n\nOpinion\n\n### How Valve is Changing Game Console Design\n\nOpinion\n\n### More PC Gaming Mice Should Follow ROG\u2019s Repairable Switches\n\n### 0 Comments\n\niFixit\n\n  * About Us\n  * Customer Support\n  * Discuss iFixit\n  * Careers\n  * Newsletter\n  * API\n\nResources\n\n  * Press\n  * News\n  * Participate\n  * Pro Wholesale\n  * Retail Locator\n  * For Manufacturers\n\nLegal\n\n  * Accessibility\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n\nStay in the loop\n\nLearn something new every month!\n\nLet me read it first!\n\nHelp translate\n\nRepair is noble\n\n\u00a9 iFixit\n\n\u2014\n\nLicensed under Creative Commons\n\n", "frontpage": true}
