Here's why they're almost certainly false.\n\nThe source of these articles is a new note from supply-chain analyst Ming-Chi\nKuo, who has been reporting on Apple's supply chain for more than 10 years.\nKuo's claims sometimes turn out to be true, but not always, and his latest\ncontradicts not only what we know about Vision Pro production, but what Kuo\nhimself said just a few months ago.\n\nSpecifically, Kuo is claiming that Apple reduced its sales forecast for Vision\nPro from a \"market consensus\" of 700-750K units to 400-450K units, a roughly\n40% reduction.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nKuo claims this is due to weaker than expected US demand, leading to a\nproduction cut ahead of global launch. Yet as recently as February Kuo said\nApple's US target for 2024 was 150-200K units, and in January he said Apple\nsold almost 200K preorders. MacRumors separately cited \"a source with\nknowledge of Apple's sales numbers\" as saying Apple had sold 200K preorders,\nparticularly ironic given it's now presenting Kuo's claim and as if it were\nofficial news.\n\nFurther, in January Kuo was referencing Apple Vision Pro \"achieving a shipment\nvolume of 500,000 units\" as the goal. This isn't just a random number - it's\nwhat multiple sources report is Apple's supply limit for the year, regardless\nof demand.\n\nThe Financial Times, The Information, and The Elec have previously reported\nthat Vision Pro production is heavily constrained by the extremely limited\nsupply of micro-OLED displays. All three sources reported that Sony, the\nsupplier, can only produce enough micro-OLED displays for less than half a\nmillion headsets in 2024. Given this, why would this claimed \"market\nconsensus\" have been 700-750K headset units in the first place? It simply\ndoesn't make sense.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nApple Reportedly Can\u2019t Make Many Vision Pro Headsets\n\nApple reportedly can\u2019t make more than half a million Vision Pro headsets per\nyear due to limited supply of its near-4K OLED microdisplays.\n\nUploadVRDavid Heaney\n\nWith a $3500 entry price Apple Vision Pro was never going to be a breakout\nmass market hit. The product's very name suggests it's just the beginning of\nthe Vision headset line, and multiple sources have reported that Apple plans a\nmuch more affordable model later in the decade. But Vision Pro's price is\ndictated by its production and supply constraints, and it's those constraints\nlimiting its volume, not lower than expected demand.\n\nDon't believe everything you read.\n\nApple Vision Pro Review: A Heavy Portable Cinema & Monitor\n\nAt $3500, Apple sets huge expectations with Vision Pro. But does it deliver?\nAnd what\u2019s it really like to own and use?
