It started as an upgrade from punch cards. The\ncomputers back in the day were using teletypes, it was just a keyboard and a\nprinter. You'd type on the keyboard, and the keystrokes would be sent to the\ncomputer (usually mainframe) and the output printed on a printer.\n\nLater on, the teletypes were replaced with terminals. A terminal was like the\ndump computer we see today. It was a CRT Monitor with a keyboard. So instead\nof getting the output on the printer, it would be displayed on the monitor.\n\nToday we still use this type of interface (Command Line) to talk with\ncomputers.\n\nThose are terminal emulators and are a big part of Unix systems, like\nGNU/Linux or MacOS. On Windows, you have PowerShell or cmd.exe file that\nallows you to type commands and get responses in the form of text. You can\nalso install GNU/Linux system on Windows in the form of WSL. CLI interfaces\nare used mostly by power users, developers, and system administrators.\n\nIf you're new to command line you can read this article: Command Line for\nBeginners \u2013 How to Use the Terminal Like a Pro [Full Handbook].\n\n## What is jQuery Terminal?\n\njQuery Terminal is a JavaScript library. It's a plugin for the jQuery library.\njQuery Terminal is more like a framework that has jQuery as its dependency.\nWe'll mostly use JavaScript and very little jQuery in this article.\n\nLet's create our terminal based portfolio using jQuery Terminal.\n\n## Base html file\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to include jQuery and jQuery Terminal\nlibrary.\n\nThis is a basic HTML file:\n\n    \n    \n    <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery.terminal/css/jquery.terminal.min.css\"/> </head> <body> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery\"></script> <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery.terminal/js/jquery.terminal.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"my-terminal.js\"></script> </body> </html>\n\nThen inside the my-terminal.js file, we will write our code in JavaScript.\n\n## How to Initialize the Terminal\n\nTo create a basic terminal you need to put in this code:\n\n    \n    \n    const commands = {}; const term = $('body').terminal(commands);\n\nThe first argument to the terminal method is called an interpreter. It's a way\nto add your commands. An object is the simplest way to create them. See\ncreating the interpreter to learn more.\n\nIf the terminal font is too small you can make it a little bit bigger with CSS\ncustom properties (also known as CSS variables):\n\n    \n    \n    :root { --size: 1.2; }\n\n## Greetings\n\nThe first thing we need to do is to get rid of the default greetings message\nand replace it with nice-looking custom ASCII Art. We will use Filget library\nwritten in JavaScript.\n\nThere are few figlet libraries on npm. We will use a package named figlet.\n\nFirst thing you can do is to pick the right font. Go to figlet playground and\nwrite the text you want for your greeting. We will use \"Terminal Portfolio\"\nand click \"Test All\". It should display your text with all the fonts. Scroll\nthrough the list and pick the font you like.\n\nWe picked a font \"slant\" that looks like this:\n\nTerminal Portfolio ASCII Art\n\nYou can copy this text and put into a string, but you will have issues like\nbackslash needed to be escaped the quote characters.\n\n    \n    \n    const greetings = ` ______ _ __ ____ __ ____ ___ /_ __/__ _________ ___ (_)___ ____ _/ / / __ \\\\____ _____/ /_/ __/___ / (_)___ / / / _ \\\\/ ___/ __ \\`__ \\\\/ / __ \\\\/ __ \\`/ / / /_/ / __ \\\\/ ___/ __/ /_/ __ \\\\/ / / __ \\\\ / / / __/ / / / / / / / / / / / /_/ / / / ____/ /_/ / / / /_/ __/ /_/ / / / /_/ / /_/ \\\\___/_/ /_/ /_/ /_/_/_/ /_/\\\\__,_/_/ /_/ \\\\____/_/ \\\\__/_/ \\\\____/_/_/\\\\____/` const term = $('body').terminal(commands, { greetings });\n\nNOTE: The second argument to the jQuery Terminal is an object with options \u2013\nwe used a single option greetings.\n\nThis doesn't look good and it's hard to modify. Also, if you create the\ngreeting by hardcoding a string, it may get distorted on smaller screens.\nThat's why we will use the figlet library in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, we need to include the figlet library in HTML:\n\n    \n    \n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/figlet/lib/figlet.js\"></script>\n\nTo initialize the library in JavaScript, we need to load the fonts:\n\n    \n    \n    const font = 'Slant'; figlet.defaults({ fontPath: 'https://unpkg.com/figlet/fonts/' }); figlet.preloadFonts([font], ready);\n\nThis code will load the 'Slant' font and call the function ready when the font\nis loaded.\n\nSo we need to write this function:\n\n    \n    \n    function ready() { }\n\nNow we can do two things, we can put the initialization of jQuery Terminal\ninside that function:\n\n    \n    \n    let term; function ready() { term = $('body').terminal(commands, { greetings }); }\n\nWith this, we can use the greeting option, but we can also use the echo method\nto render the greeting, and when initializing the terminal we will put null or\nfalse as a greetings to disable the default one:\n\n    \n    \n    const term = $('body').terminal(commands, { greetings: false }); function ready() { term.echo(greetings); }\n\nThis will work better because the library will initialize the terminal\nimmediately and will not need to wait for loading the fonts.\n\nNote that we still need to define the greetings using figlet. To do this we\ncan write this function:\n\n    \n    \n    function render(text) { const cols = term.cols(); return figlet.textSync(text, { font: font, width: cols, whitespaceBreak: true }); }\n\nThis function uses the figlet::textSync() method to return string and use\nterminal::cols(), to get the number of characters per line. With this, we can\nmake our text responsive.\n\nThis function can be used inside ready.\n\n    \n    \n    function ready() { term.echo(render('Terminal Portfolio')); }\n\nThis will create a string and pass it to the echo method. But this will be the\nsame as with:\n\n    \n    \n    term.echo(greeting);\n\nAnd our hard-coded greetings. So if you resize the terminal, the greetings\nstill can get distorted. To make the text responsive you need to echo a\nfunction. This function will be called on each re-render of the terminal,\nwhich will happen when you resize the page.\n\nWe can use the arrow function for this:\n\n    \n    \n    function ready() { term.echo(() => render('Terminal Portfolio')); }\n\nIf you want to add some text below the ASCII art, you can do this by\nconcatenating the string after render:\n\n    \n    \n    function ready() { term.echo(() => { const ascii = render('Terminal Portfolio'); return `${ascii}\\nWelcome to my Terminal Portfolio\\n`; }); }\n\nNOTE: If you run this code you will notice that there is an empty line after\nthe ASCII art. This is because the figlet library adds some spaces after the\ntext. To get rid of it you can use string::replace with a regular expression\nthat will remove all spaces and newlines from the end.\n\nWe can't use string::trim(), because we don't want to remove the leading\nlines:\n\n    \n    \n    function render(text) { const cols = term.cols(); return trim(figlet.textSync(text, { font: font, width: cols, whitespaceBreak: true })); } function trim(str) { return str.replace(/[\\n\\s]+$/, ''); }\n\nAdditional things you can do is to pause the terminal when it loads the fonts:\n\n    \n    \n    const term = $('body').terminal(commands, { greetings: false }); term.pause(); function ready() { term.echo(() => render('Terminal Portfolio')).resume(); }\n\nThe same as with jQuery, you can can chain terminal methods.\n\n### How to Add Colors to ASCII Art\n\nYou can spice up a big ASCII art by using a library called lolcat. lolcat is a\nLinux command that can style text in the terminal with rainbow colors. And\nthere is a library called isomorphic-lolcat, that you can use in JavaScript to\nmake your ASCII art in rainbow colors.\n\n### Terminal Formatting\n\nTo use the lolcat library, you first need to know how to change the colors of\nthe terminal.\n\nYou can do this using low-level formatting that looks like this:\n\n    \n    \n    [[b;red;]some text]\n\nThe whole text is wrapped in brackets and the formatting of the text is in\nadditional brackets, where each argument is separated by a semicolon. To learn\nmore about the syntax you can read the Wiki Article: Formatting and Syntax\nHighlighting.\n\nHere, we'll only use a basic change of color. Instead of red, you can use CSS\ncolor names, hex color, or rgb().\n\n### How to Use the lolcat Library\n\nTo use the library, we first need to include it in HTML:\n\n    \n    \n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/isomorphic-lolcat\"></script>\n\nTo format the string with colors, we can use this function:\n\n    \n    \n    function rainbow(string) { return lolcat.rainbow(function(char, color) { char = $.terminal.escape_brackets(char); return `[[;${hex(color)};]${char}]`; }, string).join('\\n'); } function hex(color) { return '#' + [color.red, color.green, color.blue].map(n => { return n.toString(16).padStart(2, '0'); }).join(''); }\n\nThe lolcat.rainbow will call a function in every character from the input\nstring, and pass color as an object with RGB values and the character.\n\n### Rainbow ASCII Art greetings\n\nTo use this code, you need to wrap the call to render with rainbow:\n\n    \n    \n    function ready() { term.echo(() => { const ascii = rainbow(render('Terminal Portfolio')); return `${ascii}\\nWelcome to my Terminal Portfolio\\n`; }).resume(); }\n\nYou can also use two calls to echo, since only Figlet message needs to be\nexecuted inside the function:\n\n    \n    \n    function ready() { term.echo(() => rainbow(render('Terminal Portfolio'))) .echo('Welcome to my Terminal Portfolio\\n').resume(); }\n\nYou'll notice that when you resize the window, the rainbow changes randomly.\nThis is the default behavior of lolcat. To change it, you need to set the\nrandom seed.\n\n    \n    \n    function rand(max) { return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max + 1)); } function ready() { const seed = rand(256); term.echo(() => rainbow(render('Terminal Portfolio'), seed)) .echo('Welcome to my Terminal Portfolio\\n').resume(); } function rainbow(string, seed) { return lolcat.rainbow(function(char, color) { char = $.terminal.escape_brackets(char); return `[[;${hex(color)};]${char}]`; }, string, seed).join('\\n'); }\n\nThe rand function returns a pseudo-random number from 0 to max value. Here we\ncreated a random value from 0 to 256.\n\n### How to Make the Greeting Text White\n\nAs we showed previously, you can make the text white with terminal formatting.\nYou can use:\n\n  * [[;white;]Welcome to my Terminal Portfolio]\n  * [[;#fff;]Welcome to my Terminal Portfolio]\n  * [[;rgb(255,255,255);]Welcome to my Terminal Portfolio]\n\nMoreover, if you include additional file XML formatting, you can use XML-like\nsyntax. That makes formatting much easier.\n\n    \n    \n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery.terminal/js/xml_formatting.js\"></script>\n\nAfter including the above file in HTML, you can use CSS named colors as XML\ntags:\n\n    \n    \n    <white>Welcome to my Terminal Portfolio</white>\n\nThe XML formatting supports more tags like links and images, see Extension XML\nFormatter, on a Wiki.\n\nNOTE: XML formatter is a function added to $.terminal.defaults.formatters,\nwhich transforms the input XML-like text into terminal formatting. You can add\nthe same to your own formatters.\n\n## How to Make Your First Command\n\nAfter the greeting, we can write our first command. It will be helpful and\nwill work with any commands we add later.\n\n    \n    \n    const commanns = { help() { } };\n\nThis will be our help command where we'll add a list of commands available to\nour terminal portfolio. We will use Intl.ListFormat, which creates a list of\nelements with and before the last element.\n\n    \n    \n    const formatter = new Intl.ListFormat('en', { style: 'long', type: 'conjunction', });\n\nTo create a list, we need to use formatter.format() and pass an array of\ncommands. To get that array we can use Object.keys():\n\n    \n    \n    const commands = { help() { term.echo(`List of available commands: ${help}`); } }; const command_list = Object.keys(commands); const help = formatter.format(command_list);\n\nWhen you type help you should see:\n\n    \n    \n    List of available commands: help\n\nYou also need to add the echo command:\n\n    \n    \n    const commands = { help() { term.echo(`List of available commands: ${help}`); }, echo(...args) { term.echo(args.join(' ')); } };\n\nNow the help command works:\n\n    \n    \n    List of available commands: help and echo\n\nBut if you try to execute 'echo hello' you will get an error:\n\n    \n    \n    [Arity] Wrong number of arguments. The function 'echo' expects 0 got 1!\n\nBy default, jQuery Terminal checks the number of arguments and the number of\nparameters the function accepts. The problem is that the rest operator makes\nall arguments optional and the length function property is 0. To fix the issue\nwe need to disable the arity check with an option:\n\n    \n    \n    const term = $('body').terminal(commands, { greetings: false, checkArity: false });\n\nNow the echo commands should work.\n\n## Default commands\n\nBy default, the jQuery Terminal have two default commands:\n\n  * clear: this command clears everything on the terminal.\n  * exit: this command exits from nested interpreters.\n\nYou can disable them by passing the name to the option and setting it to\nfalse. Since we won't use nested interpreters, we can disable exit:\n\n    \n    \n    const term = $('body').terminal(commands, { greetings: false, checkArity: false, exit: false });\n\nBut clear can be useful. So we can add it to the list of commands:\n\n    \n    \n    const command_list = ['clear'].concat(Object.keys(commands));\n\n## How to Make Help Commands Executable\n\nWe can make the UX better to allow clicking on the command and execute it just\nlike when the user types it. We will need a few things. First, we need to add\nformatting to each command and add an HTML class attribute. We can also make\nthe command white so it's more visible.\n\n    \n    \n    const command_list = Object.keys(commands); const formatted_list = command_list.map(cmd => { return `<white class=\"command\">${cmd}</white>`; }); const help = formatter.format(formatted_list);\n\nNext is to add affordance. To indicate that the user can click the command we\nneed to change the cursor in CSS:\n\n    \n    \n    .command { cursor: pointer; }\n\nThe last step is to execute the command when the user clicks the command. We\nneed to add an event handler with jQuery (jQuery Terminal dependency) or we\ncan use the native browser addEventListener. Here we use jQuery:\n\n    \n    \n    term.on('click', '.command', function() { const command = $(this).text(); term.exec(command); });\n\nterminal::exec() is a way to execute a command programmatically, just like\nuser would type it and press enter.\n\nYou can test it by typing help and clicking help again.\n\nClicking echo will print an empty line. We can fix it by checking if the array\nof arguments is not empty, before executing terminal::echo():\n\n    \n    \n    const commands = { echo(...args) { if (args.length > 0) { term.echo(args.join(' ')); } } };\n\nNow clicking on echo will only show the executed command.\n\nNOTE: If for any reason you don't want to show the prompt and the command that\nhas been executed, you can silence the exec by passing true as the second\nargument.\n\n    \n    \n    term.exec('help', true);\n\n## Syntax highlighting\n\nAs we discussed earlier, we can use custom syntax highlighting of our shell by\npushing a function into $.terminal.defaults.formatters.We can also use the\n$.terminal.new_formatter helper function.\n\nLet's make our commands white as we type them. The formatter can be an array\n(of regex and replacement), or a function. We have a fixed number of commands\nand we only want to make those that are on the list white. We can do this by\nadding a regular expression:\n\n    \n    \n    const any_command_re = new RegExp(`^\\s*(${command_list.join('|')})`);\n\nThis regular expression will check if, at the beginning of the string, there\nis an optional whitespace and one of the commands. Right now the regex will\nlook like this: /^\\s*(help|echo)/.\n\n    \n    \n    $.terminal.new_formatter([any_command_re, '<white>$1</white>']);\n\nIf you would like to make command arguments in different colors, you'll need a\nfunction, where you will to use String::replace.\n\n    \n    \n    const re = new RegExp(`^\\s*(${command_list.join('|')}) (.*)`); $.terminal.new_formatter(function(string) { return string.replace(re, function(_, command, args) { return `<white>${command}</white> <aqua>${args}</aqua>`; }); });\n\nThis is just an example of using String::replace. If you have just one\nreplacement, you can use an array. This will be the same:\n\n    \n    \n    const re = new RegExp(`^\\s*(${command_list.join('|')})(\\s?.*)`); $.terminal.new_formatter([re, function(_, command, args) { return `<white>${command}</white><aqua>${args}</aqua>`; }]);\n\nNOTE: If you add class <white class=\"command\"> to the formatter you will be\nable to click on the typed command to execute it again.\n\n## Tab Completion\n\nAnother feature we can add is to complete the command when you press the tab\nkey. This is super easy \u2013 we only need to add completion option set to true:\n\n    \n    \n    const term = $('body').terminal(commands, { greetings: false, checkArity: false, exit: false, completion: true });\n\nNow when you type h and press the tab it will complete the command help for\nyou.\n\n## How to Add Shell Commands\n\nNow we can add the most important commands that allow us to navigate through\nthe portfolio. We will implement directories as the main entry point so the\nuser will need to type the ls command to see the list of things, cd into that\ndirectory, and ls again to see the contents.\n\n    \n    \n    const directories = { education: [ '', '<white>education</white>', '* <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielce_University_of_Technology\">Kielce University of Technology</a> <yellow>\"Computer Science\"</yellow> 2002-2007 / 2011-2014', '* <a href=\"https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szko%C5%82a_policealna\">Post-secondary</a> Electronic School <yellow>\"Computer Systems\"</yellow> 2000-2002', '* Electronic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technikum_(Polish_education)\">Technikum</a> with major <yellow>\"RTV\"</yellow> 1995-2000', '' ], projects: [ '', '<white>Open Source projects</white>', [ ['jQuery Terminal', 'https://terminal.jcubic.pl', 'library that adds terminal interface to websites' ], ['LIPS Scheme', 'https://lips.js.org', 'Scheme implementation in JavaScript' ], ['Sysend.js', 'https://jcu.bi/sysend', 'Communication between open tabs' ], ['Wayne', 'https://jcu.bi/wayne', 'Pure in browser HTTP requests' ], ].map(([name, url, description = '']) => { return `* <a href=\"${url}\">${name}</a> &mdash; <white>${description}</white>`; }), '' ].flat(), skills: [ '', '<white>languages</white>', [ 'JavaScript', 'TypeScript', 'Python', 'SQL', 'PHP', 'Bash' ].map(lang => `* <yellow>${lang}</yellow>`), '', '<white>libraries</white>', [ 'React.js', 'Redux', 'Jest', ].map(lib => `* <green>${lib}</green>`), '', '<white>tools</white>', [ 'Docker', 'git', 'GNU/Linux' ].map(lib => `* <blue>${lib}</blue>`), '' ].flat() };\n\nThis is our basic structure. You can edit it and put your information. First,\nwe will add a cd command that changes the directory.\n\n    \n    \n    const root = '~'; let cwd = root; const commands = { cd(dir = null) { if (dir === null || (dir === '..' && cwd !== root)) { cwd = root; } else if (dir.startsWith('~/') && dirs.includes(dir.substring(2))) { cwd = dir; } else if (dirs.includes(dir)) { cwd = root + '/' + dir; } else { this.error('Wrong directory'); } } };\n\nThis will handle all the cases of changing the directory. Next is to add a\nprompt.\n\nTo see what directory we are in, we need to add a custom prompt to do this. We\ncan create a function:\n\n    \n    \n    const user = 'guest'; const server = 'freecodecamp.org'; function prompt() { return `<green>${user}@${server}</green>:<blue>${cwd}</blue>$ `; }\n\nAnd use it as an option:\n\n    \n    \n    const term = $('body').terminal(commands, { greetings: false, checkArity: false, completion: true, exit: false, prompt });\n\nThe green color don't look very good, we can use color from Ubuntu to make the\nterminal look more real.\n\n    \n    \n    $.terminal.xml_formatter.tags.green = (attrs) => { return `[[;#44D544;]`; };\n\nNext is the ls command.\n\n    \n    \n    function print_dirs() { term.echo(dirs.map(dir => { return `<blue class=\"directory\">${dir}</blue>`; }).join('\\n')); } const commands = { ls(dir = null) { if (dir) { if (dir.startsWith('~/')) { const path = dir.substring(2); const dirs = path.split('/'); if (dirs.length > 1) { this.error('Invalid directory'); } else { const dir = dirs[0]; this.echo(directories[dir].join('\\n')); } } else if (cwd === root) { if (dir in directories) { this.echo(directories[dir].join('\\n')); } else { this.error('Invalid directory'); } } else if (dir === '..') { print_dirs(); } else { this.error('Invalid directory'); } } else if (cwd === root) { print_dirs(); } else { const dir = cwd.substring(2); this.echo(directories[dir].join('\\n')); } }\n\nSimilar to green, the blue color is not that great, so we can use the color\nfrom Ubuntu. To do this, we need to use custom XML tags in XML formatting:\n\n    \n    \n    $.terminal.xml_formatter.tags.blue = (attrs) => { return `[[;#55F;;${attrs.class}]`; };\n\nWe added the HTML class for a reason. Let's change directory when the user\nclicks the directory. Just like we did with commands, we can invoke the cd\ncommand the same way as the user typing it:\n\n    \n    \n    term.on('click', '.directory', function() { const dir = $(this).text(); term.exec(`cd ~/${dir}`); });\n\nWe also need to update our CSS to change the cursor:\n\n    \n    \n    .command, .directory { cursor: pointer; }\n\n## How to Improve Completion\n\nOur completion is not perfect as it only completes the commands. If you'd like\nto have completion that also handles directories, you need to use a function:\n\n    \n    \n    const term = $('body').terminal(commands, { greetings: false, checkArity: false, completion(string) { // in every function we can use `this` to reference term object const cmd = this.get_command(); // we process the command to extract the command name // at the rest of the command (the arguments as one string) const { name, rest } = $.terminal.parse_command(cmd); if (['cd', 'ls'].includes(name)) { if (rest.startsWith('~/')) { return dirs.map(dir => `~/${dir}`); } if (cwd === root) { return dirs; } } return Object.keys(commands); }, prompt });\n\nNOTE: The string argument was left as documentation. It can be used if you\nonly want to complete a single word.\n\n## Typing Animation Command\n\nAnother command that we will add is an animated joke. We will print random\njokes using an API that looks like the user typing.\n\nWe will use Joke API.\n\nThe API returns JSON with two types of responses: twopart and a single`. This\nis the code that prints the text on the terminal:\n\n    \n    \n    // we use programming jokes so it fit better // developer portfolio const url = 'https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming'; const commands = { async joke() { const res = await fetch(url); const data = await res.json(); if (data.type == 'twopart') { // as said before in every function, passed directly // to the terminal, you can use `this` object // to reference terminal instance this.echo(`Q: ${data.setup}`); this.echo(`A: ${data.delivery}`); } else if (data.type === 'single') { this.echo(data.joke); } }, }\n\nTo add typing animation, you need to add an option to the echo method:\n\n    \n    \n    this.echo(data.joke, { delay: 50, typing: true });\n\nThere is one caveat: if you have a sequence of typing animations, you need to\nawait for the previous one to finish (the echo will return a promise when\nanimating). You need to wrap the code in an async function and you need to\nclear the prompt so don't have any flash between animations. By default,\nprompt is used for the typing effect. So the full code should look like this:\n\n    \n    \n    // we use programming jokes so it fit better // developer portfolio const url = 'https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming'; const commands = { async joke() { const res = await fetch(url); const data = await res.json(); (async () => { if (data.type == 'twopart') { // we set clear the prompt to don't have any // flashing between animations const prompt = this.get_prompt(); this.set_prompt(''); // as said before in every function, passed directly // to terminal, you can use `this` object // to reference terminal instance await this.echo(`Q: ${data.setup}`, { delay: 50, typing: true }); await this.echo(`A: ${data.delivery}`, { delay: 50, typing: true }); // we restore the prompt this.set_prompt(prompt); } else if (data.type === 'single') { await this.echo(data.joke, { delay: 50, typing: true }); } })(); }, }\n\nYou can read more about typing animation on a wiki article: Typing Animation.\n\n## Credits Command\n\nThe last command we will add is a credits command where we will list\nJavaScript libraries used:\n\n    \n    \n    const commands = { credits() { return [ '', '<white>Used libraries:</white>', '* <a href=\"https://terminal.jcubic.pl\">jQuery Terminal</a>', '* <a href=\"https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js/\">Figlet.js</a>', '* <a href=\"https://github.com/jcubic/isomorphic-lolcat\">Isomorphic Lolcat</a>', '* <a href=\"https://jokeapi.dev/\">Joke API</a>', '' ].join('\\n'); } };\n\nThis is an example of another way to print something on the terminal, if you\nreturn something from a function it will be printed. You can also return a\nPromise, so you can send an AJAX request to the server and print the results.\n\n## Prefilled Commands\n\nYou can make it easier for users to know what to do with the terminal,\nespecially if they are not that familiar with Unix. By executing example\ncommands:\n\n    \n    \n    term.exec(command)\n\nYou can also use animation with exec:\n\n    \n    \n    term.exec(command, { typing: true, delay: 50 });\n\nHere is a fully working Demo of our Interactive Terminal Portfolio Website.\n\n## What Next?\n\nYou can add a lot of commands to this portfolio. The only limitation is your\nimagination.\n\nYou can check these examples for inspiration:\n\n  * CodePen Collection with jQuery Terminal Demos.\n  * Retro (Vintage) Terminal CodePen Demo.\n  * jQuery Terminal Examples Page.\n  * Terminal 404 Error Page.\n  * Fake GNU/Linux Terminal.\n\nIf you have some idea that is not listed here you can ask on StackOverflow\nwith jquery-terminal tag. If you have something more time consuming, you can\nalso ask for paid support.\n\nIf you like this post, you can check my website, (that has a terminal\nportfolio similar to this one, and also a chat), and follow me on Twitter/X\nand LinkedIn.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJakub T.
