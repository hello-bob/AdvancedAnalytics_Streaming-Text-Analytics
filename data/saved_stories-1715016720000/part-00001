I mean, sure, I\u2019d rather it be phrased about how\nI\u2019m improving productivity, rather than how I\u2019m measuring it, but fair enough.\nI need to be accountable for engineering productivity. There are real problems\nin the org, I do need to fix them, and I need to demonstrate that I\u2019m doing\nso.\n\nJust one little problem: software productivity is famously unmeasurable.\nMartin Fowler: \u201cCannot Measure Productivity.\u201d From 2003. 2003!\n\nMore recently, Kent Beck and Gergely Orosz tackled the same question. Kent\nconcluded: \u201cMeasure developer productivity? Not possible.\u201d^1\n\n^1Kent and Gergely\u2019s two-part article is excellent and worth reading. Part\none. Part two. And a later followup.\n\nSo now what do I do? That\u2019s it, I\u2019m screwed, make up some bullshit metric and\nwatch my soul die, McKinsey style? Fight with my CEO about his impossible\nrequest until he gives up and fires me?\n\nMaybe not. I think I\u2019ve found another way. It\u2019s early, but it\u2019s working for me\nso far. Will it work for you? Eeehhhhh... maybe. Probably not. But maybe.\n\n### My Solution\n\nIt started half a year ago, in September 2023. My CEO asked me how I was\nmeasuring productivity. I told him it wasn\u2019t possible. He told me I was wrong.\nI took offense. It got heated.\n\nAfter things cooled off, he invited me to his house to talk things over in\nperson. (We\u2019re a fully remote company, in different parts of the country, so\nface time takes some arranging.) I knew I couldn\u2019t just blow off the request,\nso I decided to approach the question from the standpoint of accountability.\nHow could I demonstrate to my CEO that I was being accountable to the org?\n\nWe met at the CEO\u2019s house, along with the CTO and CPO (Chief Product Officer).\nI led them through an exercise: \u201cImagine we\u2019ve built the best product\nengineering organization in the world. What does that look like?\u201d We came up\nwith six categories of ideas. Then I asked, \u201cWhich indicators will help us\nunderstand how we\u2019re getting closer to these ideals?\u201d We came up with\nindicators in each category. Blissfully, none of those categories were\n\u201cproductivity.\u201d I don\u2019t think anyone noticed. Bullet dodged.\n\nI came away feeling fairly positive about the conversation. I discussed the\nresults with my Engineering and Product peers, we refined, and I finally\npresented the first \u201cProduct Engineering Accountability Review\u201d a few weeks\nago. It went well! I used the indicators to support a qualitative discussion\nof what\u2019s happening in Engineering, rather than just reporting numbers.\n\nOne problem: the CEO had a scheduling conflict and couldn\u2019t come. So I don\u2019t\nknow what he would have thought. But at least the CTO and CPO liked it.\n\n### The Productivity OKR\n\nMeanwhile, back in January, the leadership team had established that one of\nour company-wide OKRs^1 would be to define and improve productivity metrics\nfor each department. I was to present mine to the full Leadership team at the\nend of April. Crap. Bullet un-dodged.\n\n^1\u201cOKRs\u201d are \u201cObjectives and Key Results.\u201d They\u2019re a way of setting and\ntracking goals. Similar to Management by Objectives, about which Deming said:\n\u201cEliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical\ngoals. Substitute leadership.\u201d But that\u2019s a rant for another day.\n\nIn October, we had defined six aspects of being the greatest product\nengineering company in the world. One of them was \u201cprofitability.\u201d Its\nindicators were the most related to outcomes. If I had to measure\nproductivity\u2014and I did\u2014they were the ones to use.\n\nWe had three indicators for profitability: actual RoI, estimated RoI, and\nvalue-add capacity. The first was best, in theory. In practice, it might be\nimpossible to measure. Before I explain why, I need to explain how we\ncalculate RoI.\n\n### Product Bets\n\nEvery engineering organization I\u2019ve ever seen has had more demand than\ncapacity. Prioritizing those demands is crucial. And fraught. Lots and lots of\nopportunity for conflict.\n\nWe\u2019re no exception. To help bring order to the chaos, the VP of Product and I\nhave introduced the idea of \u201cProduct Bets.\u201d Each major initiative needs a\nProduct Bet Proposal. It's a short, one-page document that explains:\n\n  * What we\u2019re going to accomplish\n  * The value it\u2019s estimated to generate\n  * The amount we\u2019re willing to bet\n  * The justification for the value\n  * How we\u2019ll measure the value\n\nIn order for a proposal to be accepted, a member of the Leadership team needs\nto sponsor it, take accountability for its success, and convince the other\nLeadership members that their proposal is more important than all the others.\n\nIn theory, anyway. I\u2019ve tried variants of this idea before, and it\u2019s never\nlasted. Turns out leadership teams like accountability more when it\u2019s other\npeople who have to be accountable.\n\nBut we\u2019re trying. So far... it\u2019s kind of working. Maybe. Too early to tell,\nhonestly. I\u2019ll write more after the verdict\u2019s in.\n\n### A True Measure of Productivity\n\nBut if the product bet process does work... well. That would be cool. It would\ngive us a true measure of productivity. We would know the value of a bet, and\nit\u2019s easy to know how much we spend on a bet. Value produced over dollars\nspent. Boom. Productivity. Done.\n\nEven better, the numbers are nice. Very nice. Each bet has a \u201cmaximum wager,\u201d\nwhich determines how many engineer-days we\u2019ll invest in the bet before giving\nup. Those wagers are based on one tenth of the expected value over five years.\nIn other words, 10x return on investment.\n\n10x return on investment is enough to make anybody take notice. But...\nmeasuring value is a problem. Sure, each bet has an section on how we\u2019ll\nmeasure value, but can we really tease that out from sales team effort,\ncustomer success team effort, other feature changes, and changes in the\nmarket? Probably not.\n\nIt might not matter. We may not be able to measure the actual value, but every\nbet also has an estimated value attached. Combined with actual cost, that\ngives us a measure of estimated RoI. It may not be real RoI, but it\u2019s good\nenough for understanding the productivity of the engineering team.\n\nThat\u2019s our first two productivity measures: actual RoI and estimated RoI.\nPretty good. Except that we don\u2019t have any data.\n\n### A Better Measure of Productivity... For Now\n\nThe RoI metrics rely on us having product bets. But we don\u2019t. Not yet. We\u2019re\nstill rolling them out. So, no matter how good the metrics might be, we can\u2019t\nuse them. No data.\n\nThere\u2019s a third indicator in the \u201cprofitability\u201d category we can use, though.\nIt\u2019s value-add capacity.\n\nLike any engineering organization, we spend some percent of our time on fixing\nbugs, performing maintenance, and other things that are necessary but don\u2019t\nadd value from a customer or user perspective. The Japanese term for this is\nmuda.\n\nIf we didn\u2019t have any muda, spent all our time on value-add work, and achieved\na 10x return on each investment, our productivity would be ten: $10 for every\n$1 in salary (or close enough). If we spent 80% of our time on value-add work,\nour productivity would be eight. Twenty percent, two.\n\nIn other words, in the absence of RoI measures, the percent of engineering\ntime spent on value-add activities is a pretty good proxy for productivity.\n\nThat\u2019s the productivity number I reported to Leadership last week.\n\n### How It Was Received\n\nIt worked really well. The nice thing about reporting this number was that\npeople were already frustrated with Engineering\u2019s progress. They could see\nthat we had capacity problems, but they didn\u2019t know why. It was easy for them\nto assume that it was because people weren\u2019t working hard, or didn\u2019t know what\nthey were doing.\n\nI presented our metric as a single stacked bar chart. (Like a pie chart, but\nin a rectangle.) Muda on the bottom, value-add on the top. Then I expanded out\nthe muda into another stacked bar chart, showing how much time was being spent\nacross all of Engineering on deferred maintenance, bugs, on call, incident\nresponse, deployments, and so forth. Then expanded out again with more detail\nfor the worst of those categories.\n\nIt completely changed the tenor of the conversation. Suddenly, the\nconversation shifted from, \u201chow can we get the stuff we want sooner,\u201d to \u201chow\ncan we decrease muda and spend more time on value-add work?\u201d That\u2019s exactly\nthe conversation we need to be having.\n\nEarlier in the week, the CEO told me that, next quarter, Leadership wants a\nbriefing from me about how Engineering works. What my deliverables are,\nessentially. With the capacity measure, I have a good answer: my job is to\ndouble our value-add capacity over the next three years. Essentially, to\ndouble our output without increasing spending.\n\nYou know what? With my XP plans and the XP coaches I\u2019ve hired, it\u2019s totally\ndoable. I think I\u2019m being kind of conservative, actually.\n\n### A Fatal Flaw\n\nSo that\u2019s my productivity measure: value-add capacity. The percentage of\nengineering time we spend on adding value for users and customers. Can you use\nit? Eehhhhh... maybe.\n\nI can use value-add capacity\u2014so far\u2014because I\u2019m aggressively stubborn about\nhonest data. I refuse to skew our numbers or do worse work to make my\ndepartment look good, and I\u2019m keeping a close eye on what my teams are doing,\ntoo. This is important, because value-add capacity has a fatal flaw:\n\n> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\n>\n> Goodhart\u2019s Law\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculously easy to cheat this metric. Even if you correctly categorize\nyour muda\u2014it\u2019s very tempting to let edge cases slide\u2014all you have to do is\nstop fixing bugs, defer some needed upgrades, ignore a security\nvulnerability... and poof! Happy numbers. At a horrible cost.\n\nActually, that\u2019s the root of my org\u2019s current capacity problems. They weren\u2019t\ncheating a metric, but they were under pressure to deliver as much as\npossible. So they deferred a bunch of maintenance and took some questionable\nengineering shortcuts. Now they\u2019re paying the price.\n\nUnfortunately, you can get away with cheating this metric for a long time.\nYears, really. It\u2019s not like you cut quality one month and then the truth\ncomes out the next month. This is a metric that only works when people are\nscrupulously honest, including with themselves.\n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019m not sure if this will work for you. It depends on how much\nability you have to police things. The RoI indicators might not work for you\neither. They require product bets, or something similar, and that requires a\nlot of org changes. Even if they do work for me\u2014jury\u2019s out on that\u2014they\u2019re not\nsomething you can introduce overnight.\n\nBut, so far, value-add capacity is working for me, and I thought that might be\ninteresting to you. Maybe spark some ideas. Just be cautious. Goodhart\u2019s Law\nis a vengeful bastard. Remember, all this productivity metric stuff is a\nsideshow to what really matters:\n\nDeliver valuable software. Do it often. And write it well.\n\nGood luck.\n\nIf you liked this entry, check out my best writing and presentations, and\nconsider subscribing to updates by email or RSS.\n\nCopyright 2002-2024 Titanium I.T.
