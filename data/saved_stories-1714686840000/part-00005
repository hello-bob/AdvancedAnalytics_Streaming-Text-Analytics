Twenge\n\nMay 02, 2024\n\n43\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Changes in Parents\u2019 Mental Health Did Not Drive the Adolescent Mental\nHealth Crisis\n\nwww.afterbabel.com\n\n11\n\nShare\n\nIntro from Jon Haidt and Zach Rausch:\n\nWe love it when critics of our work propose alternative explanations for the\nyouth mental health crisis. Zach and I keep a whole collaborative review doc\nfull of such theories, which we invite you to view and comment on.\n\nOne alternative that some critics have recently proposed is that we shouldn\u2019t\nbe looking to the kids to find the source of the mental health crisis;\ninstead, we should be looking to the parents. These critics argue that because\nparent-aged adults have higher rates of suicide than teens and those rates\nhave been rising, it might be that parents got more depressed and suicidal in\nthe 2010s, and that has\u2014in turn\u2014influenced their children.\n\nJean Twenge has been masterful at testing these alternative theories and\nshowing that all of them contradict the timing, the demographics, or the\ninternational dimension of the epidemic. (See Jean\u2019s post: Here are 13 Other\nExplanations for the Adolescent Mental Health Crisis. None of Them Work.) In\nfact, Jean\u2019s latest post here at After Babel showed that Suicide Rates Are Now\nHigher Among Young Adults Than the Middle-Aged.\n\nIn today\u2019s cross-post from her Substack, Generation Tech, Jean shows that the\n\u201cparents first\u201d hypothesis is out of sync with the cross-generational data\nfrom the 2010s. Jean\u2019s post is important because\u2014as far as we know\u2014she is the\nfirst to use data that distinguishes between parents and non-parents. (This is\nnot possible to do with suicide rate data). Her graphs below tell a powerful\nstory: something happened to the teens, not to the parents, in the 2010s. She\nalso shows that if anything happened to the adults, it seems to have mostly\nhappened to the non-parents.\n\nPlease, send us more alternative explanations. If you have one, put it in the\ncomments at the end.1\n\n\u2014 Jon and Zach\n\nSeveral critics of the idea that Gen Z is suffering a mental health crisis\nhave argued that attention should instead be focused on the middle-aged,\nparticularly middle-aged parents. This is the group experiencing high levels\nof mental health issues, they say.\n\nIf so, that could be why teen depression has increased \u2013 not smartphones and\nsocial media, but depressed and distressed parents. Past research has indeed\nfound that when more parents experience mental distress, so do their children.\n\nIn an article headlined \u201cThe kids are all right, but the adults are\nstruggling,\u201d sociologist Mike Males wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s not the youth who are\ncreating the crisis. It\u2019s their parents\u2019 generation.\u201d He then went next-level,\ndeclaring that \u201cCollege counselors likewise invented a \u2018student mental health\ncrisis\u2019 (despite the fact that undergraduate violence and suicide rates are\nunusually low) to win more funding.\u201d\n\nPsychologist Chris Ferguson recently argued that discussion is too centered on\n\u201cGen Z (e.g. \u2018...a generation in crisis...\u2019), ignoring that mental health\nissues are much worse among their parents.\u201d Elsewhere, he contended that the\nrise in youth depression is not due to smartphones and social media but to\ntheir parents\u2019 mental health issues: \u201cIt\u2019s intergenerational. Kids are in pain\nbecause their families are in pain.\u201d\n\nThese statements offer up a testable hypothesis: Are mental health issues\nworse among the middle-aged parents of teens and young adults, or among teens\nand young adults themselves? And have mental health issues increased among\nparents? To my knowledge, no one else has examined mental health trends\nspecifically among parents in the large national datasets.\n\nMy previous post showed that the suicide rate for U.S. adults in their 20s is\nnow higher than that for middle-aged adults, reversing a long-standing trend.\nThat happened partially because suicide rates have increased so much among\nyoung people. So in terms of the suicide rate, a \u201chard\u201d statistic uninfluenced\nby self-report bias, the trends for young adults are definitely worse than for\nthe middle-aged.\n\nIn suicide data, however, there is no way of separating the data by parents\nvs. non-parents. But we can examine depression, suicidal thoughts, and mental\ndistress among parents with children 17 or under at home in the nationally\nrepresentative National Survey on Drug Use and Health. NSDUH takes a cross-\nsection of the whole population, not just those who seek help from doctors or\ntherapists; thus, trends cannot be due to over-diagnosis or more willingness\nto get professional help.\n\nWe\u2019ll first consider rates of major depressive episode (clinical-level\ndepression according to the DSM criteria). By that indicator, teens are doing\nmuch worse than middle-aged adults with children at home (see Figure 1). In\nrecent years, 1 in 5 teens suffered major depression, compared to 1 in 14 of\nparents ages 35 to 64. Depression rates among parents have barely budged,\nwhile rates for teens have more than doubled. The two groups had fairly\nsimilar depression rates in the late 2000s, but that began to change after\n2011.\n\nFigure 1. Percent suffering from a major depressive episode in the last 12\nmonths, U.S. adolescents 12-17 and 35-64 year olds with and without minor\nchildren at home, 2008-2022. Source: National Survey of Drug Use and Health.\nAnalyzed and graphed by Jean Twenge for the Generation Tech Substack. NOTE:\nDue to privacy concerns, NS-DUH reports age in groups rather than individual\nyears. 35- to 64-year-olds is the age grouping overlapping the most with those\nmost likely to have adolescent children (roughly 35-59).\n\nNot only that, but middle-aged adults with children at home are actually less\nlikely to experience minor depression than middle-aged adults without children\nat home. And, in sharp contrast to teens, neither group shows an increase in\ndepression since 2008.\n\nBreaking teens vs. parents down by gender shows an even starker pattern, with\nan enormous increase in depression among teen girls, a smaller (absolute) rise\namong teen boys, and little change among mothers or fathers with children\nstill at home (see Figure 2). Major depression among mothers actually declined\nslightly (from 9.6% to 7.3%) between 2011 and 2022.\n\nFigure 2. Percent suffering from a major depressive episode in the last 12\nmonths, U.S. adolescents 12-17 and parents 35-64, by gender, 2008-2022.\nSource: National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Analyzed and graphed by Jean\nTwenge for the Generation Tech Substack. NOTE: Mothers and fathers are those\nages 35-64 with children 17 or under living in their household.\n\nDepression rates are now higher among teen boys than among middle-aged\nmothers, a complete reversal from the usual pattern of females being more\nlikely to suffer from depression than males.\n\nShare\n\nWhat about even more serious issues, such as thinking about suicide? NSDUH\ndoes not ask that question of teens, but it does ask it of young adults. Here,\ntoo, rates for parents are much lower than for young adults, and the rates for\nyoung adults have more than doubled (see Figure 3). By the 2020s, 1 in 8 young\nadults had considered taking their own life in the previous year. For parents,\nit was less than 1 in 30, and lower for those in the same age range without\nchildren at home.\n\nFigure 3. Percent having suicidal thoughts in the last 12 months, U.S. young\nadults 18-25 and 35-64 year olds with and without minor children at home,\n2008-2022. Source: National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Analyzed and\ngraphed by Jean Twenge for the Generation Tech Substack.\n\nWhen broken down by gender, there is very little change among either mothers\nor fathers, while the number of young adult men and women having suicidal\nthoughts doubled (see Figure 4). The highest rates of suicidal ideation are\namong young women, where nearly 1 out of 6 thought about taking their own\nlives in the last year.\n\nFigure 4. Percent having suicidal thoughts in the last 12 months, U.S. young\nadults 18-25 and parents 35-64, by gender, 2008-2022. Source: National Survey\nof Drug Use and Health. Analyzed and graphed by Jean Twenge for the Generation\nTech Substack.\n\nMajor depression and suicidal thoughts are very serious issues. Perhaps\nparents are less likely to have these issues because they are parents; for\nexample, they may not think about suicide because they can\u2019t imagine leaving\ntheir kids on their own. Thus, it might be good to examine less serious but\nstill troubling symptoms of mental health issues, such as mental distress.\nNSDUH includes the Kessler-6, a 6-question measure of mental distress\nincluding questions about nervousness, hopelessness, and feeling everything is\nan effort. Even if parents aren\u2019t considering taking their own lives, they may\ncertainly be more susceptible to mental distress like this.\n\nExcept they aren\u2019t. Serious mental distress is much higher among young adults,\nwhere it has more than doubled since the early 2010s. Mental distress among\nparents is very low and has ticked up only slightly, from 4% in the early\n2010s to about 5% in the 2020s (see Figure 5). Mental distress increased\nslightly 2019-2022 among middle-aged adults without children at home, but not\namong those with children.\n\nFigure 5. Percentage with serious mental distress, U.S. young adults (18-25)\nand 35-64 year olds with and without minor children at home, 2008-2022.\nSource: National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Analyzed and graphed by Jean\nTwenge for the Generation Tech Substack. NOTE: Scores on the Kessler-6 range\nfrom 0 to 24. A score of 13 or higher is considered serious mental distress.\n\nSimilar to the other mental health indicators, serious mental distress is\nhighest among young women and lowest among mothers and fathers (see Figure 6).\nThere are large increases among young adults since 2011 and only slight change\namong middle-aged parents.\n\nFigure 6. Percentage with serious mental distress, U.S. young adults (18-25)\nand parents (35-64), by gender, 2008-2022. Source: National Survey of Drug Use\nand Health. Analyzed and graphed by Jean Twenge for the Generation Tech\nSubstack.\n\nSince NSDUH doesn\u2019t allow precision in examining age groups and doesn\u2019t\ninclude a consistent measure of child age, it admittedly may be including some\npeople in the parent group who aren\u2019t parents with adolescents. To do that, we\ncan turn to the BRFSS, administered by the CDC, which has age in more precise\ngroupings and \u2013 at least in 2021-22 \u2013 an indicator of child age.\n\nMiddle-aged people with teen children (the 40-55 age group) have fewer days of\npoor mental health than those in the same age group without minor children at\nhome (see Figure 7). Those with tween children (the 35-49 age group) also have\nfewer days of poor mental health than others in the age bracket. But who has\nthe highest number of poor mental health days? The youngest adults, those ages\n18 to 22. Other analyses of this dataset show a marked increase in poor mental\nhealth days among young adults in the last decade.\n\nFigure 7. Days per month in poor mental health, U.S. adults, by children in\nhousehold and age, 2021-2022. Source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance\nSystem. Analyzed and graphed by Jean Twenge for the Generation Tech Substack.\nNOTE: Graph shows parents with children ages 10 to 14 for those ages 35-49 and\nparents with children 15-17 for those ages 40-55, to capture the most common\nages for parents with tween and teen children, respectively, and compare them\nto those without minor children at home in the same age range.\n\nThus, across five metrics \u2014 suicide, major depression, suicidal thoughts,\nmental distress, and days in poor mental health \u2014 young people are suffering\nmore than the middle-aged, and that suffering has increased considerably since\n2011. None of this is consistent with the narrative that parents\u2019 mental\nhealth issues or intergenerational family dynamics are the cause of the mental\nhealth crisis among Gen Z. Instead, it must be something happening to the\ngeneration themselves.\n\nShare\n\nThere happens to be something else that shows the pattern of larger change\namong teens and young adults and less among older people: Face-to-face social\ninteraction, which has decreased by far the most among the young (see Figure\n8).\n\nFigure 8. Minutes per day socializing with others in person, U.S. teens and\nadults 15 years of age and older, 2003-2022. Source: American Time Use Survey,\nBureau of Labor Statistics. Analyzed and graphed by Jean Twenge for the\nGeneration Tech Substack. (NOTE: 2020 data is excluded.)\n\nAnd what has replaced face-to-face socializing? More online communication,\nwhich is not as good for mental health. It should not considered radical to\nsuggest this enormous shift might have an impact on rates of depression.\n\nIt should also not be so easy to declare that we\u2019re focusing on the wrong age\ngroup when the data so clearly point toward an overwhelming crisis among teens\nand young adults, and not among middle-aged parents.\n\nThese findings are yet another reason why the rise in teen depression is so\nremarkable: It happened at a time when violent crime, teen pregnancy,\nproblematic alcohol use, family dysfunction, unemployment, and now parental\ndepression are at historically low or at least stable rates. So much is going\nright for young people these days, including the mental health of their\nparents. Yet they are still much more depressed than teens in the 2000s,\nlikely because they spent more time online, less time with friends in person,\nand less time sleeping. That explanation fits the data much better than\ndeclaring an epidemic of depression among parents that, by the best data we\nhave, doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n### Generation Tech\n\nPsychologist and author Jean M.

I feel like Haidt puts too much weight on\nInstagram causing girls to be insecure about their looks and waiting for likes\nand comments from their friends (photoshopped magazines, billboards, and\ncelebrity photos were around and blamed for soaring numbers of eating\ndisorders and insecurities long before 2012). They need to look at the ideas\nthat are being constantly repeated in the memes, reels, and TikToks. For\nexample, that everything they feel is a symptom of anxiety or depression which\nis a central theme even in what is supposed to be funny or irreverent content.\nAlso that everything they do is somehow political or about their identity,\nthat their words, their opinions, even the content they consume or post can\nhave literally life or death effects. I feel like they discuss these issues\n(like the idea of reverse CBT in The Coddling), but they aren't making the\nconnections with that this is the content the kids are seeing more and more of\non social media. For example, if you take two teen girls who spend four hours\na day on instagram, that's too much time that will negatively effect both, but\nif one is spending that four hours watching funny videos about pandas, recipe\nvideos because she has a baking hobby, softball videos because she plays in a\nweekend rec league, and other various light non-political videos, I predict\nshe has a lot better mental health than another girl who spends that same\namount of time watching videos about politics and identity that keep her\nconstantly on edge, looking for threats and focused on problems combined with\nvideos constantly talking about their anxiety and low-key depression.Expand\nfull commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\nSpence In Austin3 hrs agoEven without the information provided, my question to\nthe proponents of this theory would be, \u201cwhy would you think it more likely\nthat parents\u2019 mental health issues are causing kids\u2019 mental health issues\ninstead of the other way around?\u201dMy personal anecdotal experience has been\nthat kids\u2019 struggles are a significant cause of stress, anxiety, and\ndepression among parents.Expand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n9 more comments...\n\nWhy the Mental Health of Liberal Girls Sank First and Fastest\n\nEvidence for Lukianoff\u2019s reverse CBT hypothesis\n\nMar 9, 2023 \u2022\n\nJon Haidt\n\n1,283\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why the Mental Health of Liberal Girls Sank First and Fastest\n\nwww.afterbabel.com\n\n453\n\nSocial Media is a Major Cause of the Mental Illness Epidemic in Teen Girls.\nHere\u2019s the Evidence.\n\nJournalists should stop saying that the evidence is just correlational\n\nFeb 22, 2023 \u2022\n\nJon Haidt\n\n1,127\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Social Media is a Major Cause of the Mental Illness Epidemic in Teen\nGirls.
