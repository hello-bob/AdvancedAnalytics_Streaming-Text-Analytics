Their lips are moving.\n\nMembers of the Senedd, the Welsh parliament, are intent on tackling this age-\nold problem by bringing in legislation that bans politicians from telling\nuntruths.\n\nIf the law comes into force, Wales would be the first country in the world to\nmake lying by politicians a criminal offence.\n\nThe former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, who is leading the charge against\nthe liars, said that in a world of post-truth politics, populism,\ndisinformation and deep fakes, and with elections taking place in the UK and\nUS this year, the issue was vital.\n\n\u201cThe public are rightly tired of seeing certain politicians lie with\nimpunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not enough for us as lawmakers to throw up our\nhands in disgust. We have the power to change the rules so all politicians act\nwith integrity, honesty and respect.\u201d\n\nPrice has been campaigning on truth and trust in politics since the mid 2000s\nwhen he tried to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq war.\n\nHe said: \u201cThen it was almost laughed out of court with comments such as:\n\u2018There aren\u2019t prisons big enough\u2019. I think over the course of two decades it\u2019s\ncome from the margins to be seen as a serious proposition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been something of a credibility gap in politics but that\u2019s\nbecome a gaping chasm. We\u2019re trying to restore what should be a basic\nprinciple: that politicians should never deliberately set out to deceive.\nHopefully it will set the precedent that could be adopted across democracies\naround the world.\u201d\n\nWelsh politicians are looking at the issue as the Senedd Cymru (members and\nelections) bill passes through the parliament. It includes plans to increase\nthe number of members and reform the voting system.\n\nPrice has tabled an amendment calling for it to be made illegal for a Senedd\nmember or candidate to wilfully mislead the parliament or the public. A\ndefence would be that the statement could reasonably be inferred to be\nopinion, belief or future intention rather than a statement of fact.\n\nHis amendment was backed by the Liberal Democrats and the Tories. The shadow\nconstitution minister, Darren Millar of the Welsh Conservatives, said:\n\u201cUntruths and misinformation have been a blight on political discourse in\nrecent years.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Headlines UK\n\nFree newsletter\n\nGet the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Jennifer Nadel, a\nco-director of the cross-party thinktank, said: \u201cThere are laws that prevent\nlying in many other professions and areas of public and professional life.\nPoliticians shouldn\u2019t be exempt from the rules that most of us live by.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be right that the unscrupulous should be allowed to knowingly make\nfalse statements to court popularity or win votes without consequence. If we\nwant to rebuild the public\u2019s trust in the political class then preventing\ndeception is a vital first step. If Wales passes this law, we hope that other\ngovernments, including that at Westminster, will introduce similar measures.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Welsh politics\n  * Wales\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Welsh government may reverse 20mph limit on hundreds of roads \u2013 but denies U-turn\n\n23 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Wales to change guidance on 20mph speed limits, transport minister says\n\n20 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Vaughan Gething to become Welsh first minister after Labour leadership win\n\n16 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Who is Vaughan Gething, the new Welsh Labour leader?\n\n16 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Vaughan Gething or Jeremy Miles to make history as Welsh Labour\u2019s new leader\n\n16 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Welsh first minister hopeful accepted \u00a3200k from waste offender\u2019s firm\n\n22 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018People should feel they belong\u2019: Jeremy Miles reveals inclusive vision for Wales\n\n1 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Wales government announces raft of cuts to public services\n\n19 Dec 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
