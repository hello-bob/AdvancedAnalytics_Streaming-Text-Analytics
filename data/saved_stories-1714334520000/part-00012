In one 2023 example, a press release from Rishi Sunak invited\ninvestment in the tech sector, calling the UK an \u2018island of innovation\u2019. In\nit, he explained that the UK corporation tax rate was the lowest in the G7 and\nthat the UK capital allowance for investors was \u2018one of the most generous\u2019 in\nthe OECD. Even better, the UK Treasury offered \u2018full-expensing for qualifying\nbusiness investments in more plant and machinery for three years \u2013 a tax cut\nworth \u00a327 billion\u2019. This is generous, and notably so when in 2023 the UK spent\nmore than \u00a3100 billion servicing the interest on state debts. And, viewed in a\ncertain light, the generosity has got results. The PM also claimed that the UK\nhas created 134 \u2018tech unicorns\u2019 \u2013 companies with a valuation of more than $1\nbillion.\n\n> For all the hype, it is notable that the FTSE 100 had more domestic tech\n> firms in the year of its founding, 1984, than it has today\n\nSunak\u2019s wide-eyed enthusiasm is broadly shared by tech boosterists in the UK.\nA 2021 report by UK start-up cheerleaders Tech Nation also boasted that\nBritain has launched more than 100 \u2018unicorns\u2019. Even if nearly half of those\nwere created between 1990 and the 2008 crash, the figures sound impressive \u2013\noutstripping every country in the world save China and the US. And Tech Nation\nclaimed better news: \u2018The UK now has an incredible 132 futurecorns [companies\nlikely to be worth $1 billion], more than France and Germany combined, which\ndemonstrates the extent to which the UK is leading Europe.\u2019\n\nBut a focus on these numbers can be misleading, because Britain\u2019s new\nbusinesses do not tend to scale up to become global challengers. The country\noffers no rivals to the biggest US firms: Meta/Facebook, Apple, Microsoft,\nAmazon and Alphabet/ Google (MAMAA). To the Forbes list of the biggest 100\npublicly traded companies, Britain contributes just three \u2013 fewer than\nSwitzerland, Germany, France, Canada, Japan, China or, of course, the US,\nwhich can claim 39 of the top 100. And, tellingly, all three UK entrants \u2013\nGSK, HSBC and Unilever \u2013 have their origins not in the dot-com boom, or even\nin the post-war period, but in the nineteenth century.\n\nFor all the hype, it is notable that the FTSE 100 had more domestic tech firms\nin the year of its founding, 1984, than it has today. The story of one of\nthem, Standard Telephones and Cables (STC), is revealing.\n\nIn 1984, STC employed 51,000 people, mostly in the UK, providing telephony\nservices that included deep-sea Atlantic cabling and, through a subsidiary,\nmainframe computing across UK government departments. In the decades before,\nSTC invented and patented technology to allow fibre-optic cables to transfer\ndata at the speed of light over any distance. And these innovations, developed\nin STC\u2019s optics lab in Harlow in the 1960s, made the cost of global\ncommunication negligible and, decades later, helped enable the World Wide Web.\n\n### Most popular\n\n#### Flora Watkins\n\n##### Inside the chaotic Household Cavalry stables\n\nYet, like 68 of the original FTSE 100 companies, STC is no longer British-\nowned. In 1991, it was sold to the Canadian telecoms giant Nortel. And, in the\nsame year in which former STC lab manager Charles Kao received the Nobel Prize\nin recognition of his fibre-optic work for STC, Nortel filed for bankruptcy.\nThe end came in 2011, when a consortium led by Apple and Microsoft outbid\nGoogle to pay $4.5 billion for Nortel\u2019s patents and the residual IP.\n\nOver the decades, other tech firms have fallen in and out of the FTSE 100\nindex. While some offered innovations that really could have reshaped modern\ncommunication, they did not make it. They could not grow. They did not scale.\n\nConsider the UK computing firm Psion. It evolved the first effective pocket\ncomputers several years before Apple developed the Newton and Microsoft\ndeveloped Windows for handheld devices. Today, the Psion Organiser is seen as\na forerunner to the smartphone, and its technology certainly foreshadowed it.\nFor example, the low-power operating system developed by the firm was the core\nof 250 million mobile devices by 2009 before ultimately losing market share to\nGoogle\u2019s superior Android platform and Apple\u2019s IOS. Psion entered the FTSE 100\nin March 2000 before dropping out after just two months. In 2012, it was\npurchased by Motorola Solutions of Chicago, Illinois. By 2023 the FTSE 100\ncontained just three tech firms: Sage, Rightmove and Auto Trader, although\narguably only the first of these is really a tech company.\n\nIf the UK government is embracing entrepreneurial tech investment, is anything\nchanging? Not really. Even Tech Nation has noticed that one pound in three\noffered to UK tech firms by institutional investors is American. As for the\n\u2018unicorns\u2019 and the \u2018futurecorns\u2019, US investors also dominate larger investment\nrounds. All of which is a little awkward for Tech Nation itself, which has\nreceived some \u00a329 million in sponsorship from the UK government to help boost\na start-up culture. As a result, its 2021 report seemed distinctly hedged\nabout the consequence of all this US investment, observing: \u2018On the one hand,\nthis could be seen as a sign of strength and burgeoning international\nreputation for investment returns in UK tech, but on the other, this may be\nseen as potentially problematic if UK tech firms with significant profit and\ninfluence are owned by non-UK actors.\u2019\n\nIt seems unthinkable that any of the UK firms backed by US institutional\ninvestors will grow to a size that could challenge already dominant US\nbusinesses. Sometimes, they are simply bought out by the US giants to take the\ninnovation out of the hands of competitors. In recent years, Google has\nsnapped up the UK companies Dataform and Redux and, perhaps most\ncontroversially, the AI innovator DeepMind, bought in 2014.\n\nAs UK investor and SongKick co-founder Ian Hogarth has written, the talent\npool for serious AI development is small. In 2018 he estimated that there are\nperhaps 700 people who can contribute to the leading edge of research. \u2018I find\nit hard to believe,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018that the UK would not be better off were\nDeepMind still an independent company. How much would Google sell DeepMind for\ntoday? $5 billion? $10 billion? $50 billion? It\u2019s hard to imagine Google\nselling DeepMind to Amazon, or Tencent or Facebook at almost any price.\u2019\n\nGoogle paid just \u00a3400 million, with no questions asked by the UK government.\n\nBritain\u2019s groundbreaking semiconductor innovations have also drifted away from\nour shores over the years. Hermann Hauser of Amadeus Capital is an Austrian-\nborn tech investor who is used to making money from selling UK tech firms.\nSome of Amadeus Capital\u2019s biggest deals have been with US firms such as\nMicrosoft. And, in 2011, Hauser sold UK semiconductor innovator Icera to the\nUS chip-maker Nvidia for $367 million. The sale was designed to help Nvidia\nengage with the smartphone revolution, but four years later it closed the UK\nfirm with the loss of 300 jobs in Bristol.\n\nToday, Hauser\u2019s view is that Britain\u2019s tech firms suffer not from a lack of\nideas, talent or research capacity but because they cannot scale up\neffectively: \u2018Europe actually doesn\u2019t have a startup problem. We produce more\nstartups than the US. It\u2019s not a startup problem, but we have a scale-up\nproblem.\u2019\n\nThere is, however, one exception: Arm Holdings. Growing out of the innovative\nbut unsuccessful Acorn Computers in the 1980s, Arm developed chips and\nsoftware that allowed computer processors to run far faster and with less\npower than many rivals. Starting in a barn in Cambridge and backed by an\ninvestment of \u00a31.5 million from Apple, Arm has grown into one of the most\nimportant tech companies in the world. With technology in more than 200\nbillion devices, the firm has successfully pioneered a business model in which\nit licenses cutting-edge computer architecture to developers across the globe.\nThe UK company has been so successful for so long that its profits even kept\nApple afloat when the US titan sold its modest investment in Arm for $800\nmillion back in the early 1990s.\n\nHauser saw it all because as well as running Amadeus Capital, he also helped\nto found Acorn Computers and Arm itself. And it is notable that, in 2020, he\nled a campaign to persuade UK and EU authorities to intervene to stop Arm\nbeing sold to Nvidia in the US by its Japanese owners SoftBank. In a letter to\nthe Financial Times he warned that the sale to a US firm would allow that\nnation to decide who gets to keep Arm\u2019s innovations or, as he said, it would\nmean \u2018that the American President can decide which companies Arm is allowed to\nsell to worldwide\u2019.\n\nThis raises the vital issue of the loss of tech sovereignty where the UK and\nEU authorities have been overwhelmed and effectively neutered. The dominance\nof Silicon Valley companies in search (Google), social media (Facebook),\nentertainment (Netflix) and e-commerce (Amazon) has become a pressing issue,\nfostering a belated debate on how we could have allowed it to happen.\n\nAs for Arm, in 2023 SoftBank decided that it should relist the business on the\nstock market but anchored to a US exchange. The British Prime Minister, Rishi\nSunak, joined numerous discussions to bring Arm back to Britain, and begged\nSoftBank to offer a secondary listing of Arm shares in the UK. This too was\ndenied. Victoria Scholar, the head of investment at Interactive Investor, told\nthe Guardian: \u2018Arm\u2019s abandonment of London is another kick in the teeth for\nthe Square Mile\u2019s attractiveness among international investors as a go-to\ndestination for technology giants.\u2019\n\nThe headline figures speak for themselves. The UK economy grew sluggishly in\nthe years following the great recession of 2008 but, in the same period, the\nUK earnings of America\u2019s biggest tech firms skyrocketed, as shown here:\n\nToday, Amazon collects more than 30 per cent of all UK online spending, and is\ngrowing steadily. That is profit-producing income that could have remained in\nthe UK but that will now ultimately return to, and be controlled from,\nAmazon\u2019s headquarters in Seattle.\n\nMeta and Google receive two-thirds of all the UK\u2019s expenditure on search and\ndisplay advertising. The profit from that could have travelled to UK\nbroadcasters and local newspapers, but it now ends up in California.\n\nThe profits made by US firms in the UK may help deliver value to consumers.\nBut they have also built up market power that small domestic businesses do not\nhave, forcing them to become US business rule-takers in their own economy. And\nthe position of UK domestic business is weakening.\n\nFor example, of the biggest US tech companies operating in the UK, most reap\nthe benefits of \u2018network effects\u2019 in which as more users join a platform, the\nmore useful the platform becomes, and the harder it is for customers to switch\nto a rival. Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn site and its Office products are all more\nuseful because others also use them. In the aftermath of the Cambridge\nAnalytica scandal, in which Facebook user data ended up in the hands of an\nunscrupulous political consultancy, one reporter put it like this: \u2018Facebook\nknows that as long as your 2 billion friends are online, you\u2019re probably not\ngoing anywhere.\u2019 Similar network effects explain why Threads found it\nimpossible to displace Twitter/X in mid-2023. Users build up a platform\u2019s\npower because innovations and revenue streams can be rolled out\ninternationally to billions of people at once.\n\nIn media streaming, scale is critical. For example, Netflix boasted that it\ninvested $17 billion in content in 2023 and was instantly able to distribute\nthat content to 238 million subscribers in more than 150 countries. In\ncontrast, when the production companies that feed UK broadcasters seek\ninternational deals for their shows, each one must be individually negotiated.\n\nScaled businesses using the network effect are well placed to diversify, too.\nIn addition to its own distribution business, Amazon has expanded into\nstreaming services, home entertainment and, of course, broader tech services.\nAs if to demonstrate the power of scale, Amazon has created a platform through\nwhich many UK-based suppliers can sell. It has become so large that 60 per\ncent of Amazon sales are now made through its \u2018Amazon Marketplace\u2019. Amazon\ntakes a margin on all these sales, builds its brand, dictates service quality\nand refers all problems back to the suppliers. The major advantage to Amazon\nis that for these Marketplace sales it does not need to hold any stock: it has\nbecome for many UK businesses the toll bridge which they must cross. Jeff\nBezos\u2019s vision that his platform should become the \u2018everything store\u2019 offering\nlimitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices is\nnow entrenched as the dominant force in UK retail commerce.\n\n> Britain\u2019s consumers, workers and businesses are learning exactly what it\n> means to be a twenty-first century vassal\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) began as an attempt by Amazon to control its own web\nhosting, creating a system that could handle the growing data storage and\ntraffic to its site. By 2002, Jeff Bezos had dispatched a team of data\nscientists to South Africa to develop a product for others to use, now known\nas \u2018the cloud\u2019. It took just two years to launch but it grew fast without\ndramatically increasing overheads.\n\n\u2018This has to scale to infinity,\u2019 Mr Bezos instructed staff, \u2018with no planned\ndowntime. Infinity!\u2019 Today, AWS is worth at least $500 billion to its parent\ncompany. Most of the UK government\u2019s websites and data are on AWS, which hosts\neverything from websites to streamed video. Even Britain\u2019s most popular porn\nsite, Pornhub, of Canada, with 2 billion UK visits annually (yes, billion), is\nhosted on AWS. Although Amazon does not have the UK market to itself, it does\nhave about 40 per cent, and its competitors are all American: the other big\nplayers being Google Cloud Storage and Microsoft\u2019s Azure.\n\nEven for the smaller US tech firms, diversification and innovation are at the\nheart of their plans. Despite lack of profitability, Uber and Lyft have poured\nbillions of dollars into research-and-development projects such as driverless\ncars.\n\nLarger firms, meanwhile, push to buy up potential competitors and out-innovate\ntheir rivals to create unassailable market positions. In the past decade,\nFacebook decided to out-compete social media rival Snapchat by buying and\nrebuilding Instagram. Tesla, while selling electric vehicles more successfully\nthan other car manufacturers, is also developing driverless systems. It is\ndiversifying further, pledging to parlay its driverless-car research into\ndeveloping a humanoid robot \u2013 called \u2018Optimus\u2019 or the \u2018Tesla Bot\u2019. Ultimately,\nthese businesses hope to build what investor Warren Buffett calls \u2018moats\u2019\naround themselves: a set of unique characteristics that ensure consumers are\nhooked and their behaviour is predictable and predictably advantageous for the\ncompany. Following Buffett\u2019s investment in Apple, one of his colleagues\ndescribed Apple\u2019s moat: \u2018Once you are fully invested in the Apple ecosystem\nand you\u2019ve got your thousands of photographs up and in the cloud and you are\nused to the keystrokes and functionality and know where everything is, you\nbecome a sticky consumer.\u2019\n\nOne of Amazon\u2019s moats is its compelling sales offering, with an intuitive\nwebsite and speedy delivery. Another is the \u2018Kindle ecosystem\u2019 for digital\nbook sales, which is unrivalled. Uber offers special value and convenience\nthrough its app and dense network of vehicles on the road. Airbnb has an\nunmatched roster of landlords prepared to offer rooms, huts and homes on short\nleases. The sheer scale of Facebook\u2019s popularity is a moat \u2013 which includes 73\nper cent of all regular internet users in the UK \u2013 and the platforms owned by\nFacebook/Meta combine to reinforce it: Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and\nFacebook.\n\nEach of these businesses builds momentum: surplus revenue is poured into R&D,\nand into diversification. The new products and services are themselves also\nscalable, and they bind customers more closely to the original brand, creating\nnew customers for it. Quickly, this process repeats until the business\u2019s\nposition becomes entrenched, creating a de facto monopoly. At that point it\ncan churn out profits. A virtuous cycle \u2013 but if your firm is on the outside,\nfailing to scale and at the mercy of impatient investors, you might sell out\ninstead. The quick return has mostly been the British way.\n\nIn 2010, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist warned of short-termism in the\nUK markets, and since then academic studies have provided more evidence that\n\u2018systematic pressures exist in the UK context for the over-payment of\ndividends, leading to potential underinvestment\u2019.\n\nConsider the position of one of Britain\u2019s biggest public technology companies:\nAviva. At the start of 2024, the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends\nto shareholders was 280 per cent. In August 2023, Aviva\u2019s half-yearly report\nboasted: \u2018The consistency and strength of our performance supports the\ndelivery of attractive outcomes for our shareholders.\u2019\n\nCompare the tone with that of Netflix in their 2017 annual report: \u2018We are in\nno rush to push margins up too quickly,\u2019 it told shareholders, \u2018as we want to\nensure we are investing aggressively enough to continue to lead internet TV\naround the world.\u2019 Amazon has a similar vision for a strategy of domination:\nin his report for the first quarter of 2020, Bezos said: \u2018If you are a\nshareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we\u2019re not thinking\nsmall.\u2019 Amazon may have paid for its founder\u2019s trip to space, but it has never\npaid a dividend and is not thinking of doing so any time soon.\n\nIn Britain it is said that dividends keep managers \u2018honest\u2019. But in the tech\neconomy, the demand for dividends helps keep UK businesses small \u2013 and\npotential US competitors want them to stay that way. And if British businesses\nare small, they are discovering that they feel it when dealing with scaled,\ndiversified and \u2018moated\u2019 US corporations as they have little power and little\nchoice about what they pay, how they pay it or what information they must\ndisclose to do business.\n\nFor Hermann Hauser, all this comes down to three questions, as paraphrased in\nan article for Forbes: \u2018Do we control the critical technology in our own\ncountry? Do we have access to the technology from multiple independent\ncountries? Do we have long-term, guaranteed, unfettered and secure access to\nthe technology from a monopoly or oligopoly supplier from a single country?\u2019\nHauser elaborated as follows: \u2018If the answer to the above three questions is\nno, you have to make changes. There is a danger of becoming a new vassal state\nto these tech giants. It\u2019s the danger of a new kind of colonialism, which is\nnot enforced by military might but by economic dependence.\u2019\n\nBritain\u2019s consumers, workers and businesses are learning exactly what it means\nto be a twenty-first-century vassal and to be plundered by a more powerful\nnation. They are learning the advantages of scale in technology, but also how\nthe tech giants and the US platforms have become deeply embedded in the UK.\nAnd how US companies take a slice out of almost every transaction.\n\nFreddy Gray speaks to Angus Hanton & Social Democratic Party leader William\nClouston for the Americano podcast:\n\n\u00a9Angus Hanton from Vassal State: How America Runs Britain (Swift Press, \u00a325\nhardback).\n\n## A blooming good offer\n\nSubscribe to The Spectator this spring and get 3 months for just \u00a33\n\nCLAIM OFFER 3 months for \u00a33 REGISTER 2 articles a week\n\nAlready a subscriber?
