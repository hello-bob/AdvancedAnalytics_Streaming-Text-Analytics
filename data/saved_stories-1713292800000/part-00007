Qdrant Hybrid Cloud stands as the industry\u2019s first managed\nvector database that can be deployed in any environment - be it cloud, on-\npremise, or the edge.\n\nAs the AI application landscape evolves, the industry is transitioning from\nprototyping innovative AI solutions to actively deploying AI applications into\nproduction (incl. GenAI, semantic search, or recommendation systems). In this\nnew phase, privacy, data sovereignty, deployment flexibility, and control are\nat the top of developers\u2019 minds. These factors are critical when developing,\nlaunching, and scaling new applications, whether they are customer-facing\nservices like AI assistants or internal company solutions for knowledge and\ninformation retrieval or process automation.\n\nQdrant Hybrid Cloud offers developers a vector database that can be deployed\nin any existing environment, ensuring data sovereignty and privacy control\nthrough complete database isolation - with the full capabilities of our\nmanaged cloud service.\n\n  * Unmatched Deployment Flexibility: With its Kubernetes-native architecture, Qdrant Hybrid Cloud provides the ability to bring your own cloud or compute by deploying Qdrant as a managed service on the infrastructure of choice, such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Vultr, Red Hat OpenShift, DigitalOcean, OVHcloud, Scaleway, STACKIT, Civo, VMware vSphere, AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.\n\n  * Privacy & Data Sovereignty: Qdrant Hybrid Cloud offers unparalleled data isolation and the flexibility to process vector search workloads in their own environments.\n\n  * Scalable & Secure Architecture: Qdrant Hybrid Cloud\u2019s design ensures scalability and adaptability with its Kubernetes-native architecture, separates data and control for enhanced security, and offers a unified management interface for ease of use, enabling businesses to grow and adapt without compromising privacy or control.\n\n  * Effortless Setup in Seconds: Setting up Qdrant Hybrid Cloud is incredibly straightforward, thanks to our simple Kubernetes installation that connects effortlessly with your chosen infrastructure, enabling secure, scalable deployments right from the get-go\n\nLet\u2019s explore these aspects in more detail:\n\n#### Maximizing Deployment Flexibility: Enabling Applications to Run Across\nAny Environment\n\nQdrant Hybrid Cloud, powered by our seamless Kubernetes-native architecture,\nis the first managed vector database engineered for unparalleled deployment\nflexibility. This means that regardless of where you run your AI applications,\nyou can now enjoy the benefits of a fully managed Qdrant vector database,\nsimplifying operations across any cloud, on-premise, or edge locations.\n\nFor this launch of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud, we are proud to collaborate with key\ncloud providers, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Red Hat\nOpenShift, Vultr, DigitalOcean, OVHcloud, Scaleway, Civo, and STACKIT. These\npartnerships underscore our commitment to delivering a versatile and robust\nvector database solution that meets the complex deployment requirements of\ntoday\u2019s AI applications.\n\nIn addition to our partnerships with key cloud providers, we are also\nlaunching in collaboration with renowned AI development tools and framework\nleaders, including LlamaIndex, LangChain, Airbyte, JinaAI, Haystack by\ndeepset, and Aleph Alpha. These launch partners are instrumental in ensuring\nour users can seamlessly integrate with essential technologies for their AI\napplications, enriching our offering and reinforcing our commitment to\nversatile and comprehensive deployment environments.\n\nTogether with our launch partners we have created detailed tutorials that show\nhow to build cutting-edge AI applications with Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on the\ninfrastructure of your choice. These tutorials are available in our launch\npartner blog. Additionally, you can find expansive documentation and\ninstructions on how to deploy Qdrant Hybrid Cloud.\n\n#### Powering Vector Search & AI with Unmatched Data Sovereignty\n\nProprietary data, the lifeblood of AI-driven innovation, fuels personalized\nexperiences, accurate recommendations, and timely anomaly detection. This\ndata, unique to each organization, encompasses customer behaviors, internal\nprocesses, and market insights - crucial for tailoring AI applications to\nspecific business needs and competitive differentiation. However, leveraging\nsuch data effectively while ensuring its security, privacy, and control\nrequires diligence.\n\nThe innovative architecture of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud ensures complete database\nisolation, empowering developers with the autonomy to tailor where they\nprocess their vector search workloads with total data sovereignty. Rooted\ndeeply in our commitment to open-source principles, this approach aims to\nfoster a new level of trust and reliability by providing the essential tools\nto navigate the exciting landscape of enterprise AI.\n\n#### How We Designed the Qdrant Hybrid Cloud Architecture\n\nWe designed the architecture of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud to meet the evolving needs\nof businesses seeking unparalleled flexibility, control, and privacy.\n\n  * Kubernetes-Native Design: By embracing Kubernetes, we\u2019ve ensured that our architecture is both scalable and adaptable. This choice supports our deployment flexibility principle, allowing Qdrant Hybrid Cloud to integrate seamlessly with any infrastructure that can run Kubernetes.\n\n  * Decoupled Data and Control Planes: Our architecture separates the data plane (where the data is stored and processed) from the control plane (which manages the cluster operations). This separation enhances security, allows for more granular control over the data, and enables the data plane to reside anywhere the user chooses.\n\n  * Unified Management Interface: Despite the underlying complexity and the diversity of deployment environments, we designed a unified, user-friendly interface that simplifies the Qdrant cluster management. This interface supports everything from deployment to scaling and upgrading operations, all accessible from the Qdrant Cloud portal.\n\n  * Extensible and Modular: Recognizing the rapidly evolving nature of technology and enterprise needs, we built Qdrant Hybrid Cloud to be both extensible and modular. Users can easily integrate new services, data sources, and deployment environments as their requirements grow and change.\n\n#### Diagram: Qdrant Hybrid Cloud Architecture\n\n#### Quickstart: Effortless Setup with Our One-Step Installation\n\nWe\u2019ve made getting started with Qdrant Hybrid Cloud as simple as possible. The\nKubernetes \u201cOne-Step\u201d installation will allow you to connect with the\ninfrastructure of your choice. This is how you can get started:\n\n  1.
