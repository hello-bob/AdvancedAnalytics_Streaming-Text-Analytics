Not in a\n\u201cI wanna get rich\u201d kind of way, and no not in a power for the sake of power\nclout chasing kinda way either. There was simply something I really wanted to\npull off, and that something required a company - and I was going to try real\nhard to do it.\n\nAs I shamelessly squirmed my way from failed pitch to failed grant application\nto failed pitch again - surely (but far too slowly) crawling my way out of the\nDunning Kruger pit - day after day I found myself thinking \u201cWow! if only\nsomeone would just give me fifty THOUSAND american dollars, imagine what I\ncould do!\u201d\n\nAhh, unbridled youth.\n\nA few years and several force majeures later, realizing that the difference\nbetween what I was trying to do and how experienced I actually was was far too\ngreat for anyone to take me seriously (not to mention actually succeeding), I\ndecided there was only one thing left for me to do:\n\nOpen a completely different company, grow as a founder through there, knock it\nout of the park, then come back and build the original one with my newfound\nabilities and credentials.\n\nJury\u2019s still out on that one to be fair.\n\nAnd so I did. Along with my outrageously kickass team of co-founders, after\ntwo years of bootstrapping the other company, we finally succeeded in raising\nour first round of ONE MilLiOn dOlLaRs!\n\nIt\u2019s not hyperbole to say that a few years earlier I would have very likely\ngiven up my pinky finger to have that amount of capital to deploy at a project\nI believe in. I had always felt that sum to be a Looney Tunes amount of money.\n\nLet me tell you, the high was unbelievable. We had worked our asses off non\nstop, filled to the brim with self-doubt, getting into debt, and almost going\nbankrupt (a startup cliche that still makes us cringe to mention), and were\nfinally given what we needed most. A financial lifeline, and perhaps more\nimportantly at the time - a vote of confidence from someone else.\n\nTechnically we were aiming for 2 million, but that didn\u2019t seem to matter any\nmore. We excitedly sat down and re-organized the budget:\n\nWe\u2019re a small team working at below market wage. Add some expenses here, throw\nin fees there, assume such and such marketing spend increasing per month by so\nand so, bla bla bla, crunch the numbers and voilla - 12 months of runway\nworking pretty much as we already are.\n\nSuddenly that didn\u2019t sound like very much. Gulps and Ruh-roh\u2019s all around.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong - this is a very good thing for founders, but as this new\nunderstanding was dawning on us, we were being constantly bombarded with the\nopposite perspective as our friends from outside the industry heard the news.\nOne by one they\u2019d lose their minds: \u201c1 MILLION dollars?!\u201d they\u2019d exclaim wide-\neyed. \u201cThat\u2019s SO MUCH! You guys have practically made it!\u201d\n\nBut suddenly, all us founders could think about were our \u201clabour months\u201d. We\nbasically got 12 units of labour months. That\u2019s what 1 million dollars is.\n\nIt\u2019s a yearly budget that you get to have in the bank all at once, but then\ngradually spend at yourself and a few others at below market rate while\nworking the entirety of your ass off for a <1% chance of any meaningful\nupside.\n\nAgain - this is VERY GOOD. I\u2019m not scoffing at this at all. But it\u2019s as if\nover the course of a week we suddenly became grizzled old veterans, too wise\nand disillusioned to fall for cheap capitalist tricks any longer, such as 7\nsilly zeroes in a row in a bank.\n\nAnd became just about ready for our Bukowski phase! Yeehaw!\n\nFortunately, we\u2019ve raised more capital since (wow how fast 12 months fly), and\nthe value of the company seems to have demonstrably gone up so that\u2019s good...\nbut the high is not the same anymore. We accept our new labour months with\nstolid contentment and relief, and get back to work.\n\nEvery passing day we understand how gargantuan our task is, and how that\ninitial naivete - that complete, comically absolute, underestimation of just\nwhat it takes to actually build something - is probably the only reason anyone\ncan ever bring themselves to attempt it in the first place.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you a little secret, one that I don\u2019t think many founders would\nagree with, but on our team is a well accepted fact: we have already won. It\u2019s\njust not because of the seven zeroes like our friends think - it\u2019s because we\ngod damn love working together, and every day is a challenge and a blast.\n\nIt\u2019s not the arbitrary amount of dollars we have under our command, it\u2019s how\nmuch we\u2019ve succeeded in making the days they allow us to spend together\nmeaningful. This makes our labour months almost immeasurable in worth (and\nwhen they are measured, boy are they valuable). 6, 12 or 24 of them in a row\nis as close to divinity as we\u2019ll likely ever come.\n\nWe\u2019re doing our best and if we win we win. If we don\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d in startup terms,\nwe\u2019ve won just by virtue of how we\u2019ve grown, and the time we got to spend\ntogether growing.\n\nIf this image isn\u2019t familiar I kindly beg you stop everything and watch this\nadmittedly overly masculine yet extremely wholesome animation. I\u2019m burning top\nnotch CTA real estate here!\n\nThe end!
