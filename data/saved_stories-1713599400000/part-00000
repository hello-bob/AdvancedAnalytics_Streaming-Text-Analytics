It told me that a bubble goes\nthrough five stages \u2013 rather as Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross said people do with\ngrief. For investment bubbles, the five stages are displacement, boom,\neuphoria, profit-taking and panic. So let\u2019s see how this maps on to our\nexperience so far with AI.\n\nFirst, displacement. That\u2019s easy: it was ChatGPT wot dunnit. When it appeared\non 30 November 2022, the world went, well, apeshit. So, everybody realised,\nthis was what all the muttering surrounding AI was about! And people were\nbewitched by the discovery that you could converse with a machine and it would\ntalk (well, write) back to you in coherent sentences. It was like the moment\nin the spring of 1993 when people saw Mosaic, the first proper web browser,\nand suddenly the penny dropped: so this was what that \u201cinternet\u201d thingy was\nfor. And then Netscape had its initial public offering in August 1995, when\nthe stock went stratospheric and the first internet bubble started to inflate.\n\nSecond stage: boom. The launch of ChatGPT revealed that all the big tech\ncompanies had actually been playing with this AI stuff for years but had been\ntoo scared to tell the world because of the technology\u2019s intrinsic flakiness.\nOnce OpenAI, ChatGPT\u2019s maker, had let the cat out of the bag, though, fomo\n(fear of missing out) ruled. And there was alarm because the other companies\nrealised that Microsoft had stolen a march on them by quietly investing in\nOpenAI and in so doing had gained privileged access to the powerful GPT-4\nlarge multimodal model. Satya Nadella, the Microsoft boss, incautiously let\nslip that his intention had been to make Google \u201cdance\u201d. If that indeed was\nhis plan, it worked: Google, which had thought of itself as a leader in\nmachine learning, released its Bard chatbot before it was ready and retreated\namid hoots of derision.\n\nBut the excitement also triggered stirrings in the tech undergrowth and\nsuddenly we saw a mushrooming of startups founded by entrepreneurs who saw the\ntech companies\u2019 big \u201cfoundation\u201d models as platforms on which new things could\nbe built \u2013 much as entrepreneurs once saw the web as such a foundational base.\nThese seedlings were funded by venture capitalists in time-honoured fashion,\nbut some of them received large investments from both tech companies and\ncorporations such as Nvidia that were making the hardware on which an AI\nfuture can supposedly be built.\n\n> Generative AI turns out to be great at spending money, but not at producing\n> returns on investment\n\nThe third stage of the cycle \u2013 euphoria \u2013 is the one we\u2019re now in. Caution has\nbeen thrown to the winds and ostensibly rational companies are gambling\ncolossal amounts of money on AI. Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, started\ntalking about raising $7tn from Middle Eastern petrostates for a big push that\nwould create AGI (artificial general intelligence). He\u2019s also hedging his bets\nby teaming up with Microsoft to spend $100bn on building the Stargate\nsupercomputer. All this seems to be based on an article of faith; namely, that\nall that is needed to create superintelligent machines is (a) infinitely more\ndata and (b) infinitely more computing power. And the strange thing is that at\nthe moment the world seems to be taking these fantasies at face value.\n\nWhich brings us to stage four of the cycle: profit-taking. This is where canny\noperators spot that the process is becoming unhinged and start to get out\nbefore the bubble bursts. Since nobody is making real money yet from AI except\nthose that build the hardware, there are precious few profits to take, save\nperhaps for those who own shares in Nvidia or Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft\nand Alphabet (nee Google). This generative AI turns out to be great at\nspending money, but not at producing returns on investment.\n\nStage five \u2013 panic \u2013 lies ahead. At some stage a bubble gets punctured and a\nrapid downward curve begins as people frantically try to get out while they\ncan. It\u2019s not clear what will trigger this process in the AI case. It could be\nthat governments eventually tire of having uncontrollable corporate behemoths\nrunning loose with investors\u2019 money. Or that shareholders come to the same\nconclusion. Or that it finally dawns on us that AI technology is an\nenvironmental disaster in the making; the planet cannot be paved with\ndatacentres.\n\nBut it will burst: nothing grows exponentially for ever. So, going back to\nthat original question: are we caught in an AI bubble? Is the pope a Catholic?\n\n## What I\u2019ve been reading\n\nCreation theory The State of the Culture, 2024 is an intriguing blogpost by\nTed Gioia.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best\nObserver writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.
