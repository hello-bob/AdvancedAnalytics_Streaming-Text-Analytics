It's been around for 15 years, and has grown into an\nindustry - generating countless tools and quite a revenue. And yet, many\npeople can't answer the question with certainty.\n\nThere is something to unpack here, says Baruch Sadogursky as he takes the\nstage at the Miami Shift Conference. A conspiracy theory, even.\n\nAnd here it is:\n\n> \u201cDevOps is a conspiracy by Ops people to make developers work harder.\u201d\n\nJokes aside, Baruch urges us to look into who teaches us about DevOps. A quick\nGoogle search along the lines of \u201cWhat is DevOps\u201d reveals that the answer to\nthis question can be found on the websites of AWS (an Ops platform), Atlassian\n(a DevOps company), Gitlab (Offering DevOps in the box), Synopsis (\nObservability platform). Is it a coincidence that all sources that teach us\nabout DevOps are (dev)ops or DevOps-adjacent companies?\n\nWhy do they want to sell DevOps ideas to us so badly? Is it about the revenue\nthat the industry generates? A DevOps salary is almost double that of a system\nadministrator (with not that great of a difference in the job description);\nthere are almost 20k open positions for DevOps engineers in us alone, and\nlet\u2019s not forget about the certification business behind it.\n\nOne could easily make the connection between money and the push for DevOps \u2013\nbut only if we forget to go back in time to when DeOps first started. When it\nwas first conceived and gained momentum, the money was just not there, Baruch\nnotes.\n\n## This looks familiar\n\nIf we look at the DevOps cycle, it seems pretty familiar \u2013 it is basically an\nagile development cycle, with an Ops cycle plastered on there, and suddenly\nit\u2019s supposed to all be dev work! Even when we look at the main aspects of\nDevOps work, we hear Ops concepts: deploying code, going from code commit to\nrunning code in production, unplanned outages, and degraded services.\n\nBaruch protests that none of them feature in the basic postulates of dev work:\nDevelopers do new features, refactor, and fix bugs; that\u2019s the job. The code\npasses the tests; it works, and the job is done. What happens in production is\nbeyond the scope of work, so there is no room for these ops concepts there,\nright?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not that simple. If we take a look at a software craftsman\ndefinition of done Baruch provided, the list is much longer:\n\nThe project is done once the dev understands what needs to be done; the code\nis simple, readable, and easy to deploy; non-functional requirements are met;\nno tech debt was created; tests pass & QA is happy with the code; team lead,\nPO and client are all satisfied. That\u2019s a much longer list, and what stands\nout is quality.\n\nBaruch leads with another difficult question here: What is quality, that we\u2019re\nso concerned about?\n\n## Testing in production = caring about what happens in production\n\nQuality is an ever-evolving concept. It\u2019s certainly not what it was ten years\nago, as Baruch illustrates with an example of his old bank website, which\nallowed you to check your balances and transactions but nothing more complex.\nIt was nice to have but not critical, so when the website was out for 12 hours\nfor update & maintenance to ensure quality of service, that was not a big\ndeal.\n\nThat era is gone \u2013 we expect more of our software now. In terms of banking, we\ndo it via mobile app and expect everything to work at all reasonable times,\nand to work quickly and efficiently. Code quality alone is not enough to cater\nto that.\n\nLet\u2019s just look at the size of the global datasphere \u2013 175ZB. There is more\nand more data in more and more companies, which makes testing harder. Since we\nhave so much data in production that we cannot, or at least it\u2019s not worth\nreplicating in staging. So, we test in production:\n\n> And if we\u2019re testing in production, and being in production is what is\n> needed to ensure the software quality that\u2019s so important to us as\n> developers, that means we now care what happens in production.\n>\n> And if we care about what happens in production, that means we have to be\n> there when we throw untested software on unsuspecting customers in\n> production and observe the blast radius from our bunker. We have to be there\n> in the middle of the night with the ops people because this is actually the\n> first time we get to test our software.\n\n## The new scope of work\n\nThis new turn of events means that there are some more items on the\ndevelopers\u2019 to-do list:\n\n  * We understand how our software is going to be deployed\n  * The build is reliable, repeatable & fast\n  * The code is stateless & scalable\n  * It starts fast and dies fast\n  * It is observable\n  * It supports feature flags\n  * It\u2019s backward & forward-compatible\n  * The code emits event streams\n\nThis is what you need to ensure the quality of your software in production,\nsays Baruch, so starting now, you care about this stuff:\n\n> 10 years in, developers are still not excited about DevOps. But still, we\n> have to be there \u2013 because we care about what we\u2019re doing. So how do we go\n> from to :).\n\nSo, is DevOps a plot by Ops people? For sure, Baruch says, but it\u2019s also an\nevolution and a means to an end. The end being quality, new features, lean\nsoftware and security. DevOps just delivers what every business needs.\n\n## DevOps engineers are rainbow-farting unicorns\n\nSo now that you\u2019re thrown into DevOps, you better get to know it. If we look\nat the traditional DevOps Venn diagram, we can see that DevOps is an\nintersection between Devs, QA, and Ops. So, are you supposed to master all\nthose disciplines? If that thought terrifies you, Baruch has some good news:\n\n> That person does not exist. It is a rainbow-farting unicorn, completely made\n> up. DevOps is not about one person; it\u2019s about collaboration.\n\nInstead, he suggests there are T-shaped people: People who know their job\n(coding) well but also understand what the Ops and QA part of the house means.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean developers have to become QA and Ops; they just take an\ninterest in what they do.\n\nThat\u2019s not so bad, is it? Or, in Baruch\u2019s own words:\n\n\u201cDevOps is fine.\u201d\n\n> subscribe shift-mag --latest\n\n## Sarcastic headline, but funny enough for engineers to sign up\n\nGet curated content twice a month\n\nWritten by people, not robots - at least not yet.
