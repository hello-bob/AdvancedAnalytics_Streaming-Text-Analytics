For\nCody, we always want to provide the latest and greatest models to users\u2014which\nis why LLM interoperability is a core feature of the product.\n\nLLM interoperability helps with two things:\n\n  * Integrating with the latest models lets Cody become smarter and more capable in short order after new models are released\n  * As a user, you\u2019re able to choose the models you prefer since Cody supports multiple options interchangeably\n\nEarlier in March, we saw this trend continue with the announcement of the\nClaude 3 family of models, and today, we\u2019re announcing that Claude 3 models\nare now available to all Cody users.\n\n### Why Claude 3?\n\nCody has supported Anthropic models since its first release, including Claude\n2.0, Claude 2.1, and Claude Instant. In Anthropic\u2019s recent announcement blog,\nthey shared that the Claude 3 family shows lots of improvements to prior\nClaude models in the benchmarks.\n\nThe Claude 3 family includes three models: Haiku (the fastest model), Opus\n(the most intelligent model), and Sonnet (the in-between model). Anthropic\u2019s\nblog goes into depth on where each of them shines, but we\u2019ll share some\nspecifics from their blog on why they\u2019re good candidates for Cody:\n\n  * All Claude 3 models show better performance in code generation\n  * Sonnet is comparable in intelligence to Claude 2.1 while being 2x faster\n  * Opus is a similar speed to Claude 2.1 while being far more intelligent\n  * Opus excels at the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) evaluation, which tests the model\u2019s ability to recall information from a large amount of data. This translates to Cody\u2019s need to pull information out of large amounts of code used as context\n\nThe Claude 3 models also offer a huge 200K token context window. Cody doesn\u2019t\nuse this entire context window today; we limit Cody\u2019s context window to\nroughly 7K tokens. We do this to ensure Cody doesn\u2019t use too much context and\nlose track of the most useful context in the process, hurting response\nquality. Since Claude 3\u2019s Needle in a Haystack performance is improved, and it\ncan more accurately recall relevant information from a large amount of\ncontext, we\u2019ll be dramatically expanding Cody\u2019s context window in the coming\nweeks.\n\nTl;dr: the Claude 3 models are impressive, and they\u2019re now another option that\nCody users can select from as we continue to make Cody more customizable for\ndevs\u2019 preferences.\n\n### Cody\u2019s performance with Claude 3\n\nWe rolled out Claude 3 models to our Cody Pro users in March, and early\nfeedback has been extremely encouraging. Of Cody Pro users who primarily used\nGPT-4, over 55% switched their preference to the new Claude 3 models in the\nmonth following launch.\n\nWe also recently launched an AI experiment tool called LLM Litmus Test to help\nyou compare and contrast different models. You can test Claude 3 vs. Claude\n2.1 or even Claude 3 vs. GPT-4 Turbo and generate shareable links with your\nresults. Using the litmus test, we can see some examples of Claude 3 Opus in\naction.\n\nExample 1: Explaining a coding concept (React)\n\nHere, you can see how Claude 3 Opus does a great job explaining code concepts.\nClaude 3 explained how to use React\u2019s useContext() in a step-by-step tutorial.\nCompare that to Claude 2.1, which dropped all the example code in a single\ncode block with less detailed instructions.\n\nCheck it out yourself \u2192\n\nExample 2: Explaining a coding concept (Axum)\n\nWe can also compare Claude 3 Opus with GPT-4 Turbo. We asked both models to\nexplain another concept: creating a route with Axum. Both models provided a\ncode block, but Claude 3 Opus did a distinctly better job explaining the code\nstep-by-step.\n\nCheck it out yourself \u2192\n\nExample 3: Explaining existing code\n\nLet\u2019s also look at an example in the IDE. Here, we asked Cody to explain how\nan authentication component in our codebase works. Claude 2.1 gave a good (but\nslightly simplified) explanation of how the component works, starting with the\nprops the component receives. Claude 3 Opus gave a much more detailed\nexplanation of how the component works, and it structured the information in a\nway that was easy to follow. It also went into more detail on the props for\nthe component and which of them are optional.\n\nClaude 2.1 explaining codeClaude 3 Opus explaining code\n\nYou can also check out our recent video from Chris Sev for more examples of\nClaude 3 + Cody.\n\n### How to access Claude 3 in Cody\n\nClaude 3 models are now available to all Cody users:\n\nFor Claude Free users: Sonnet is now the default model powering chat and\ncommands, replacing Claude 2.0. This change was made in the latest VS Code and\nJetBrains extension versions (VS Code v1.12.0 and JetBrains v5.5.2).\n\nFor Cody Pro users: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus are now available as options for\nchat and commands. Pro users can find them in the model dropdown selector in\nthe latest extension versions.\n\nFor Cody Enterprise users: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus are now available as\noptions for chat and commands. Sourcegraph instance admins can switch to\nClaude 3 models once they upgrade to the latest Sourcegraph release\n(5.3.9104). Check out the April release blog for more information.\n\n### Get Cody, the AI coding assistant\n\nCody makes it easy to write, fix, and maintain code.\n\nLearn more\n\n## Products\n\n  * Cody\n  * Code Search\n\n## Solutions\n\n  * Enterprise\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Library\n  * Customer stories\n  * Changelog\n  * Documentation\n  * Community\n  * Support forum\n\n## Company\n\n  * About\n  * Careers - We're hiring!\n  * Contact\n  * Handbook\n  * Sourcegraph strategy\n\n  * \u00a9 2024 Sourcegraph, Inc.\n  * Terms\n  * Security\n  * Privacy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
