In the UK, ads are\nallowed on .gov.uk websites, subject to some limitations. The .gov and .gov.uk\nsites flagged by Silent Push each publish an ads.txt file that spells out the\nbusinesses allowed to automatically sell that site's ad space to advertisers\nas a visitor arrives.\n\nFor those who don't know, websites can sell ad space to advertisers in real-\ntime via exchanges or brokers just as visitors land on pages; this typically\ninvolves trading pseudonymous information about those visitors so that, for\ninstance, an advertiser can bid higher for an ad slot if the netizen is deemed\nvaluable. Ads.txt lists the outfits allowed to sell this ad space inventory on\nbehalf of a site, and Silent Push found a bunch of UK and US government\nwebsites with that file listing various advertising exchanges and resellers\nranging from Google (like what El Reg uses) to one in China.\n\n\"Ad tech integrated into government websites is generally a bad idea and\nthere's good reason the US government bans the practice across their .gov\nnamespace,\" explained Zach Edwards, senior threat analyst at Silent Push, in\nan email to The Register. \"It's slightly shocking to see so many UK council\nwebsites with online ads.\"\n\nOne of the ad-tech vendors used by the .gov.uk sites, and highlighted by\nSilent Push, is Yeahmobi. This Chinese entity reportedly had its mobile ad SDK\nremoved from the Google Play Store in 2018 for alleged ad fraud. Yeahmobi did\nnot respond to requests for comment.\n\nEdwards' concern is that these advertising brokers may have access to data\nassociated with website visitors, such as their IP addresses and other\nidentifiers. Netizens may not expect this when visiting a public-sector\nportal.\n\nSilent Push's report identifies four .gov sites that, in our experience, do\nnot display adverts though do ping web ad platforms, do list various exchanges\nin their ads.txt files, and may break US government CISA rules. In the UK,\nit's a different story, as 18 sites identified by Silent Push use Yeahmobi\namong others to display ads somewhere on pages. Here's a selection:\n\n  * Transport for London: ads.txt\n  * Derbyshire Dales District Council: ads.txt\n  * Walsall Council: ads.txt\n  * The Met Office: ads.txt\n\nThe .gov.uk websites have the files app-ads.txt and sellers.json as well as\nads.txt that declare approved ad tech partners. App-ads.txt is used for\nadverts delivered through mobile apps. They're all designed to, ideally,\nmitigate advertising fraud.\n\n\"Ad bidding is a complex process,\" the Silent Push report explains. \"In a\nnutshell, on these sites, user data is ingested via Google advertising\nendpoints. The visitor's IP address (or partial IP address), user agent device\n(ie device type), and browser details then are shared with ad exchange\npartners via server-side data sharing.\"\n\nThe entities in the ads.txt file then get that data, unless the publisher has\ntaken the unusual step of opting out.\n\nThereafter, the report explains, those ad platforms and any intermediaries\nhave the chance to submit bids in the ad space auction. The winning bidder\ngets to serve an ad to the website and also has the opportunity to sync data\nback through ad tech partners, which may include click data if the person\nseeing the ad navigates through to the advertised destination page.\n\nThe Register asked a technologist familiar with government websites (who asked\nnot to be identified) about the Silent Push findings. They were not worried,\nabsent any evidence the ads are funneling data back to China.\n\n### 'Unbridled'\n\nJason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group for digital content\nproducers, showed a bit more concern. \"I think it's fair to say a UK or US\ngovernment website wouldn't intentionally pass its citizens' data to a Chinese\nentity, so this just speaks to the unbridled nature of ad tech and user data\nthat is mined and monetized through it,\" he told The Register.\n\n\"It's also reasonable to assume most UK citizens wouldn't want their personal\ndata passed to a Chinese entity,\" he added.\n\nSilent's Edwards pushed back against the suggestion there's nothing to see\nhere. \"Ads.txt and app-ads.txt includes the entities authorized to bid on the\nwebsite visitors to show ads,\" he noted.\n\n\"The organizations do not drop trackers onto the page by default, [but] they\nare getting data via the advertising bid stream \u2013 the server-side data sharing\nthat occurs globally trillions of times per day.\n\n\"So these organizations don't all immediately get JavaScript access to drop on\nthe page but they do get payloads from the bid stream \u2013 and by default it\nincludes sensitive fields, like the device IP address. There are settings that\npublishers can toggle on to limit some of the personal data from being shared\nvia the bid stream, but there's no indication this is on for these UK sites \u2013\nespecially based on the significant number of vendors that are authorized by\nthe domains.\"\n\n  * UK government to set deadline for removal of Chinese surveillance cams\n  * UK elections are unaffected by China's cyber-interference, says deputy PM\n  * Five Eyes intel chiefs warn China's IP theft program now at 'unprecedented' levels\n  * Over a million Neighbourhood Watch members exposed through web app bug\n\nThis is not quite the same concern as tracking pixels on public-sector\nwebsites. But it's similar, according to Edwards, who noted privacy promises\nin the ad-bidding world have been challenged in court.\n\n\"The JavaScript of [tracking] pixels captures similar data that the JavaScript\nof real-time bidding endpoints collects, with the core difference being that\npixels can set a cookie on your browser immediately, whereas in ad tech the\nthousands or tens of thousands of entities with opportunities to bid don't get\nan opportunity to put a cookie on your computer unless they win an auction \u2013\nand then only through approved attribution vendors,\" he explained.\n\n\"Ad buyers only get their own direct opportunity to put cookies or execute\nJavaScript in your browser if you click on the ads.\"\n\nEdwards said his hope is that making government officials more aware that this\nis happening in the UK and US will lead to stronger policies that explicitly\nban ads on government websites. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * China\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * China\n  * Privacy\n  * United Kingdom\n  * United States of America\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alabama\n  * BBC\n  * Brexit\n  * British Armed Forces\n  * California\n  * Central Intelligence Agency\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * cookies\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Digital advertising displays\n  * ESA\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * Five Eyes\n  * Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * JD.com\n  * London\n  * New Mexico\n  * New York\n  * Parliament of the United Kingdom\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Scotland\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * United States Armed Forces\n  * United States Department of Commerce\n  * US Treasury\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n  * Virginia\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n\n#### More about\n\n12 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * China\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * China\n  * Privacy\n  * United Kingdom\n  * United States of America\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alabama\n  * BBC\n  * Brexit\n  * British Armed Forces\n  * California\n  * Central Intelligence Agency\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * cookies\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Digital advertising displays\n  * ESA\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * Five Eyes\n  * Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * JD.com\n  * London\n  * New Mexico\n  * New York\n  * Parliament of the United Kingdom\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Scotland\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * United States Armed Forces\n  * United States Department of Commerce\n  * US Treasury\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n  * Virginia\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### US legislators propose American Privacy Rights Act -
