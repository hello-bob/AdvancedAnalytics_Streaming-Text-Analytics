But, the hope sure does\nkeep us alive.\n\n##### Play Whack-A-Mole with Stale Data\n\nIt is easier to keep fixing bugs forever and leave the problem for tomorrow.\nIt's someone else's problem then.\n\n##### SQL does not make things any easier\n\nIt happily adds expense to complexity while convoluting the requirements.\n\n##### Complexity has gone through the roof\n\nComplex cache invalidation schemes & Design Patterns struggle to hold the\nline.\n\n##### Everyone does their own thing\n\nEveryone tries to solve the problem. The lucky succeed, while most fail. The\nones with the deepest pockets win.\n\n#### Hallucination-free Code Generation\n\nCode generate data context and data source objects which works seamlessly with\nyour database schema while integrating caching, data access and search without\nmanual cache management or search indexing logic.\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Simplicity beats Complexity anyday\n\nArc simplifies business logic to make your code easier to read, understand &\nmaintain while your developers are more productive. This means no SQL, no\nquery tuning, no database optimization & good riddance to convoluted business\nlogic!\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Backend as a Service\n\nWhy reinvent the wheel by creating your backend from scratch when you can use\na robust, reliable & mature Backend as a Service which gives you everything\nyou need on day one?\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Jewels\n\nSensational Core Framework Pristine components polished to perfection from a\nlifetime of experience. Does everything you can imagine and much, much more.\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Terra\n\nFully Integrated Cloud Microservices. Featuring our cutting-edge Trace engine\nto seamlessly meld together what used to require massive teams, expensive\ntechnology & constant support. The only fully integrated platform on the\nplanet.\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Arc\n\nRapid Application Development Platform. Foundational Technology which includes\ntemplates, designs and components for building hyper-scalable, multi-region\napplications.\n\nLearn More\n\n## We are a Research Company\n\nOur mission is to advance data-driven Software Development by fundamentally\nreimagining it, leveraging decades of industry experience to transcend current\nlimitations and challenges.\n\nWe will achieve this goal by offering reusable, industry-agnostic services and\ndevelopment tools designed with two key goals in mind: simplifying code and\nproviding a robust foundation for all aspects of building data-driven\napplications. Our aim is to empower developers to focus on building the\napplication rather than the infrastructure behind it.\n\nOur Research focuses on continuous improvement in areas like Caching, Search,\nData Access, Multi-threaded Programming, Programming Language Capabilities,\nConfiguration Management, State Handling, and Logging.\n\n#### Address\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\n#### Contact\n\ncontact at redfly dot ai\n\n#### Sales\n\nsales at redfly dot ai\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Nautilus Research, 2023\n\n", "frontpage": false}
