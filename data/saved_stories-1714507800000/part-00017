The paper, \u201cPathfinder: High-Resolution Control-Flow\nAttacks Exploiting the Conditional Branch Predictor,\u201d is based on findings\nfrom scientists from UC San Diego, Purdue University, Georgia Tech, the\nUniversity of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Google.\n\n### Novel attacks target Intel processors\n\nThe new paper, \u201cPathfinder: High-Resolution Control-Flow Attacks Exploiting\nthe Conditional Branch Predictor,\u201d details two novel attacks that could\ncompromise the billions of Intel processors in use. They discover a unique\nattack that is the first to target a feature in the branch predictor called\nthe Path History Register, which tracks both branch order and branch\naddresses. As a result, more information with more precision is exposed than\nwith prior attacks that lacked insight into the exact structure of the branch\npredictor.\n\nTheir research has resulted in Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\naddressing the concerns raised by the researchers and advising users about the\nsecurity issues. Intel is set to issue a Security Announcement, while AMD will\nrelease a Security Bulletin.\n\nIn software, frequent branching occurs as programs navigate different paths\nbased on varying data values. The direction of these branches, whether \u201ctaken\u201d\nor \u201cnot taken,\u201d provides crucial insights into the executed program data.\nGiven the significant impact of branches on modern processor performance, a\ncrucial optimization known as the \u201cbranch predictor\u201d is employed. This\npredictor anticipates future branch outcomes by referencing past histories\nstored within prediction tables. Previous attacks have exploited this\nmechanism by analyzing entries in these tables to discern recent branch\ntendencies at specific addresses.\n\nIn this new study, researchers leverage modern predictors\u2019 utilization of a\nPath History Register (PHR) to index prediction tables. The PHR records the\naddresses and precise order of the last 194 taken branches in recent Intel\narchitectures. With innovative techniques for capturing the PHR, the\nresearchers demonstrate the ability to not only capture the most recent\noutcomes but also every branch outcome in sequential order.\n\nRemarkably, they uncover the global ordering of all branches. Despite the PHR\ntypically retaining the most recent 194 branches, the researchers present an\nadvanced technique to recover a significantly longer history.\n\n\u201cWe successfully captured sequences of tens of thousands of branches in\nprecise order, utilizing this method to leak secret images during processing\nby the widely used image library, libjpeg,\u201d said Hosein Yavarzadeh, a UC San\nDiego Computer Science and Engineering Department PhD student and lead author\nof the paper.\n\n### Spectre-style poisoning attack raises concerns\n\nThe researchers also introduce an exceptionally precise Spectre-style\npoisoning attack, enabling attackers to induce intricate patterns of branch\nmispredictions within victim code. \u201cThis manipulation leads the victim to\nexecute unintended code paths, inadvertently exposing its confidential data,\u201d\nsaid UC San Diego computer science Professor Dean Tullsen.\n\n\u201cWhile prior attacks could misdirect a single branch or the first instance of\na branch executed multiple times, we now have such precise control that we\ncould misdirect the 732nd instance of a branch taken thousands of times,\u201d\nadded Tullsen.\n\nThe team presents a proof-of-concept where they force an encryption algorithm\nto transiently exit earlier, resulting in the exposure of reduced-round\nciphertext. Through this demonstration, they illustrate the ability to extract\nthe secret AES encryption key.\n\n\u201cPathfinder can reveal the outcome of almost any branch in almost any victim\nprogram, making it the most precise and powerful microarchitectural control-\nflow extraction attack that we have seen so far,\u201d said Kazem Taram, an\nassistant professor of computer science at Purdue University and a UC San\nDiego computer science PhD graduate.\n\nIn addition to Dean Tullsen and Hosein Yavarzadeh, other UC San Diego\ncoauthors are: Archit Agarwal and Deian Stefan.

Sloan\nResearch Fellowship; and gifts from Intel, Qualcomm, and Cisco.\n\n### Responsible disclosure\n\nResearchers communicated the security findings outlined in the paper to both\nIntel and AMD in November 2023. Intel has informed other affected\nhardware/software vendors about the issues. Both Intel and AMD addressed the\nconcerns raised in the paper through a Security Announcement and a Security\nBulletin (AMD-SB-7015), respectively. The findings have been shared with the\nVulnerability Information and Coordination Environment (VINCE), Case\nVU#157097: Class of Attack Primitives Enable Data Exposure on High End Intel\nCPUs.\n\nMore about\n\n  * attacks\n  * chip\n  * cybersecurity\n  * hardware\n  * Intel\n  * software\n\nShare\n\n## Featured news\n\n  * Triangulation fraud: The costly scam hitting online retailers\n  * Tracecat: Open-source SOAR\n  * Why the automotive sector is a target for email-based cyber attacks\n\nDownload eBook: Cloud security skills\n\n## Sponsored\n\n  * eBook: Do you have what it takes to lead in cybersecurity?\n  * eBook: Why CISSP?\n  * The CISO\u2019s guide to reducing the SaaS attack surface\n\n## Don't miss\n\n  * Triangulation fraud: The costly scam hitting online retailers\n  * Tracecat: Open-source SOAR\n  * Why the automotive sector is a target for email-based cyber attacks\n  * eBook: Do you have what it takes to lead in cybersecurity?\n  * UK enacts IoT cybersecurity law\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 1998-2024 by Help Net Security\n\nRead our privacy policy | About us | Advertise\n\nFollow us\n\n", "frontpage": false}
