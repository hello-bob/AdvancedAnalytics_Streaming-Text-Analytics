The tokens allow users to specify scopes to\ndetermine what the token can access. This is a typical way of getting API keys\nin other SaaS products. However, PATs only have broad scopes (e.g. all repos\nor orgs), which grant access to anything the user can access (i.e. specific\nrepos or orgs cannot be specified).GitHub Packages will add support for the\nnew version of PATs and provide the ability to scope access to read and/or\nwrite to the GitHub Packages registries.\n\n### Intended Outcome\n\nUsers can scope the new version of PATs to access packages\n\n### How will it work?\n\nNo response  \n---  \nThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:  \n  \ngithub locked and limited conversation to collaborators Sep 14, 2022\n\ngithub-product-roadmap added code-to-cloud ga Feature phase: Generally\navailable labels Sep 14, 2022\n\nankneis removed the code-to-cloud label Oct 5, 2022\n\nankneis changed the title PAT v2 support for Packages Packages support for\nfine-grained PATs Oct 18, 2022\n\nankneis added packages Feature: GitHub Packages shipped Shipped labels Oct 18,\n2022\n\nankneis closed this as completed Oct 18, 2022\n\nankneis removed the shipped Shipped label Oct 24, 2022\n\nankneis reopened this Oct 24, 2022\n\ngithub-product-roadmap added all Product SKU: All personal access tokens\n(PATs) Feature: Personal Access Tokens (PATs) labels Feb 22, 2023\n\nSign up for free to subscribe to this conversation on GitHub.
