The Senate passed its biggest procedural hurdle Tuesday\nafternoon in an 80-19 vote. The bill will get a final vote shortly, likely\nsending it to President Biden\u2019s desk, where Biden said he\u2019d sign it.\n\nIf it goes through, it would force TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to\nseparate from the app within a year or be banned in the States. This doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily mean a ban is imminent, but it means that the president will have\na great deal of leverage to make the sale happen in the foreseeable future.\n\nSupporters say the bill\u2019s necessary to protect American data from the Chinese\ngovernment. TikTok and other critics argue it would curb free-expression\nrights for 170M American TikTok users.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Tik-ban saga\u2019s long: US leaders have been trying to ban the addictive app\nsince 2020. But now things are moving fast. Here are some companies that could\nbe affected by a TikTok ban, based on how they mention the app in earnings\ntranscripts and filings as either friend or foe.\n\nMETA\n\n$428.51\n\n-13.17%\n\nToday\n\nSNAP\n\n$10.91\n\n-1.53%\n\nToday\n\nGOOG\n\n$156.25\n\n-3.01%\n\nToday\n\n# Social media: Meta, Snap, and others\n\nIf the TikTok economy collapses, it\u2019ll be a major win for rivals Meta, Google,\nand Snap, who each have TikTok copycats ready to step in (Reels, YouTube\nShorts, and Spotlight). TikTok\u2019s popularity among Americans has grown faster\nthan any other social platform, and if it vanishes, its 170M US users would\nlikely move to its rivals. TikTok\u2019s often cited as a risk factor in social\ngiants\u2019 earnings:\n\n  * Meta: \u201cUser growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services.\u201d\n\n  * Snap: \u201cWe compete with other companies in every aspect of our business, particularly with companies that focus on mobile engagement and advertising. Many of these companies, such as Alphabet (including Google and YouTube), Apple, ByteDance (including TikTok), Meta (including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp), Pinterest, and X (formerly Twitter), may have greater financial and human resources and, in some cases, larger user bases.\u201d\n\nULTA\n\n$404.48\n\n-1.48%\n\nToday\n\nELF\n\n$172.67\n\n-2.44%\n\nToday\n\nEL\n\n$143.93\n\n-2.33%\n\nToday\n\nCOTY\n\n$11.4\n\n-2.52%\n\nToday\n\n# Beauty: Elf, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Coty, Ulta, Clinique, and others\n\nThese days, beauty companies are heavily reliant on social media (especially\nTikTok) to gain viral traction for their products \u2014 from Clinique\u2019s Black\nHoney Lipstick and Elf\u2019s liquid filter foundation to Coty\u2019s Kylie Cosmetics.\nIf a ban happens, it could dent beauty marketing:\n\n  * Elf: \u201cWe're one of the first beauty brands on TikTok, where we \u2014 our first hashtag challenge, I think had something like 3 billion views well before most people knew what TikTok was... So, our ability to go deep in a particular platform, be native in terms of how people are using it, is one of our key strengths.\u201d\n\n  * L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s March report: \u201cL\u2019Or\u00e9al is no. 1 in influencer market share (+5.5 points compared to 2022 to the end of November 2023), boosted by strong leadership and increased TikTok.\u201d\n\n  * L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s February earnings call: \u201cThere's like an appetite for beauty. And on TikTok is by far the number one category. And I think the number of video views have doubled in 2023. So, there is this appetite.\u201d\n\n  * Ulta: \u201cIn December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty.\u201d\n\nRVLV\n\n$19.19\n\n-3.08%\n\nToday\n\nCROX\n\n$122.33\n\n-2.73%\n\nToday\n\nWBA\n\n$17.61\n\n-1.15%\n\nToday\n\nTGT\n\n$163.78\n\n-0.94%\n\nToday\n\n# ...retail in general\n\nJust like with beauty marketing, TikTok has played an important role in growth\nfor Gen Z popular apparel brands like Revolve and Crocs, as well as old-school\nretailers like Target and Walgreens. It plays a key part in customer-\nacquisition strategies and is often cited as a growth driver on corporate\nearnings calls:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n  * Revolve: \u201cWe had a really phenomenal quarter, in part driven by a TikTok Shop, that was really successful for us in the quarter.\u201d\n\n  * Crocs: \u201cIn August, we dropped our fourth Lightning McQueen Adult Clog with strong \u2014 with a very strong unveil on TikTok, garnering approximately 38 million views, our best-performing TikTok ever.\u201d\n\n  * Walgreens: \u201cWe had a TikTok influencer put something up about peeled mango gummies, and we can't keep them in stock now.\u201d\n\nWMG\n\n$31.42\n\n-1.72%\n\nToday\n\n# Music: UMG, Sony, and Warner\n\nVertical dances and lip-sync vids are big business. Record labels have grown\nincreasingly reliant on TikTok for the success of their songs, and are even\ntailoring tunes to what they think will go viral. Without that exposure, they\ncould lose $$. But one record label said it could live without it: after\nTikTok and Universal Music Group failed to agree on royalty payments, TikTok\nremoved all music from UMG artists like T. Swift and Drake. UMG\u2019s focusing on\nother platforms:\n\n  * UMG: \u201cWith regard to TikTok, we've disclosed that our former deal generated about 1% of total UMG annual revenue. Because other platforms in the social video category achieved much greater monetization, we're focused on accelerating our partnerships with YouTube, Meta, Snap and others and we look forward to updating you in the coming weeks ahead about exciting competitive developments and incremental opportunities emerging within the category.\u201d\n\n  * Warner Music: \u201cWe hope that UMG and TikTok come to a resolution and a good collaboration that's healthy for the ecosystem. To the extent that there's greater prominence on TikTok like greater prominence is a good thing. TikTok is a great marketing and promotion platform and tool.\u201d\n\nWith the biggest hurdles cleared, we\u2019re a vote away from it being basically\njust up to Biden as to whether these companies will have a whole lot more to\ntalk about soon.\n\n### More Markets\n\nSee all Markets\n\nMatt Phillips\n\n17h\n\n## Chipotle continues to go on a tear, hitting a sales record\n\nHey it might not be the kind of AI stock investors are all hot and bothered\nover, but don\u2019t sleep on the burrito business.\n\nChipotle posted much better-than-expected results on Wednesday, with sales\nrising 14% to a record $2.70B in the first quarter, which is like a billion\nadditions of guac.\n\nProfits jumped 23% to $359M.\n\nChipotle has quietly cruised higher over the last year.

The iconoclastic\nentrepreneur took Tesla from a market capitalization of roughly $2 billion at\nthe time of its IPO in 2010 to $1.2 trillion in early 2023. That\u2019s a return of\nabout 55,000%. Musk made a lot of people a lot of money.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla shares are down nearly 60% since their all-time peak.\nThe company has ceded ground in EVs, prompting a series of profit crushing\nprice cuts to preserve market share. The cumulative loss in market value over\nthat period is pushing $800 billion. Few corporate executives have presided\nover such a degree of value destruction.\n\nAnd it could get worse, as people are bracing for an ugly update when Tesla\nreports after the close Tuesday.\n\nJack Raines\n\n4/22/24\n\nNvidia had the 2nd-largest stock decline, ever\n\nWhere does Nvidia's recent plunge rank in the steepest stock crashes?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### Latest Stories\n\n## Meta exhaustingly tries to merge the metaverse and AI\n\nGonna have to rename the company... again\n\nRani Molla1h\n\nChris Black\n\nBlack\u2019s Gold\n\n2h\n\nCan you justify a $335 trashcan?
