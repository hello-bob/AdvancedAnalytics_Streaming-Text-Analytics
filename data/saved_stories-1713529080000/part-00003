He cited the e-commerce\nplatform\u2019s buyer base doubling, \u201cwhich has now grown on a year-over-year basis\nfor four consecutive quarters.\u201d\n\nMuch of that is due to Etsy\u2019s merchant growth. The number of Etsy sellers rose\n21% from 2022 to 2023, according to the marketplace. But this growth may have\ncome at a cost: some merchants tell Modern Retail they\u2019ve found the site\nharder to use due to increased competition, SEO troubles and hiked fees.\n\nEtsy has long marketed itself as a go-to destination for handmade and\npersonalized goods. But some sellers say they\u2019ve felt crowded out by accounts\nselling items in bulk, dropshipping products or offering items at low price\npoints. Add to that Etsy\u2019s fee structure \u2014 which rose in 2022 from 5% per sale\nto 6.5% \u2014 and some sellers say it\u2019s difficult to make enough money to support\nthemselves, especially in an inflationary environment.\n\nModern Retail spoke with five sellers about their experiences selling on Etsy\nin the last five years. The sellers work in various categories including\nfashion and general merchandise. All joined Etsy in hopes of selling\nhandcrafted or vintage items. Now, some believe the site operates in a manner\nakin to Amazon, as the site has become proliferated with dropshipped items,\ndupes and print-on-demand services \u2014 some of which are listed in ways that\nviolate Etsy\u2019s policies. Sellers also voiced concerns about the number of\nseemingly mass-manufactured items on the platform.\n\nWhen contacted for this piece, Etsy did not provide an on-the-record\nstatement. However, an Etsy spokesperson said the company considers it\ncritical to protect the integrity of Etsy\u2019s marketplace. After Modern Retail\nsent Etsy links to listings that appear to break the platform\u2019s rules, Etsy\nteam members reviewed the listings, decided they violated Etsy\u2019s policies and\nremoved them from the platform.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the stuff on Etsy now is stuff that you could easily get on\nAmazon,\u201d one jewelry seller who wished to remain anonymous told Modern Retail.\n\u201cI think that the platform is just really, really crowded, and it\u2019s less about\nartisans competing with each other, and more about artisans competing with\nthese other players.\u201d\n\nEtsy has made some recent moves to appease sellers. Earlier this year, it\nadded expiration dates to certain coupons, something sellers had requested.\nAnd, not every seller has had a negative experience with the company. One\nseller, Danna Crawford, told Modern Retail she\u2019s been able to move merchandise\nfaster on Etsy than some other platforms. \u201cI had a doll listed on eBay for\nover a year, and it sold on Etsy within six months,\u201d Crawford, who mainly\nsells memorabilia, said. \u201cIt was an international sale, and it was a very easy\nprocess.\u201d\n\nStill, others tell Modern Retail that they no longer sell on the platform, are\nthinking of leaving or have stopped buying gifts for others on Etsy as a\nwhole.\n\n## Etsy\u2019s changing selling landscape\n\nEtsy was founded in 2005 as an alternative to companies that sold mass-\nmanufactured goods. Its network of artisanal sellers is its selling point.\n\u201cYou are not buying directly from Etsy, but from one of the many talented\nsellers on Etsy,\u201d Etsy\u2019s buyer policy says. Its policy is also careful to note\nthat \u201cEtsy does not pre-screen items sold on Etsy and therefore does not\nguarantee or endorse any items sold on Etsy.\u201d\n\nOn the backs of these sellers, Etsy has been able to build a big business. It\nwent public in 2015 and now has a market cap of more than $8 billion. Etsy\nreached an \u201call-time high\u201d of 92 million active buyers in 2023, according to\nits earnings results. It also achieved its highest quarterly revenue, $842\nmillion, during its most recent fourth quarter.\n\nEtsy requires anyone selling handmade items to label these as such, per Etsy\u2019s\nhandmade policy. Dropshipping \u2014 a type of fulfillment in which a seller\noutsources aspects of production such as storing and shipping \u2014 is also\npermitted under Etsy\u2019s rules, as long as the dropshipped items meet certain\nrequirements. They cannot, for instance, be listed as \u201chandmade\u201d if the seller\ndid not make or design at least part of the product. Sellers can work with\nproduction partners like printing, casting and engraving companies to make\nfinal products, provided they disclose information about their production\npartners on listings and to Etsy.\n\nOffering handmade items is key to Etsy\u2019s value proposition \u2014 a key point of\ndifferentiation from companies like eBay or Depop. On those platforms, much of\nthe focus remains on resale rather than on giving merchants the ability to\nshowcase handcrafted goods.\n\nAnd yet, some Etsy sellers are starting to use the platform to push out items\nthat appear antithetical to Etsy\u2019s original vision.\n\nEtsy only permits the resale of vintage goods and crafts supplies, per its\npolicy. But Modern Retail found listings on the platform for fast-fashion\nblazers, shirts and jackets from retailers like H&M and Shein. Those listings\nwere taken down after Modern Retail flagged them to Etsy\u2019s team.\n\nBulk items, too, are commonplace, from bundles of enamel chains to \u201cmystery\npacks\u201d of rings. And, as The Atlantic reported last year, Etsy shoppers can\nbuy AI-generated goods like designs for coloring books or clip art.\n\n\u201cI think the homey, arts-and-crafts, really cute-and-innocent feel of Etsy\nkind of went away,\u201d Kiara Mendez, a former Etsy seller who left the platform\nin 2020, told Modern Retail. \u201cI was automatically turned off by that.\u201d\n\nAn Etsy spokesperson told Modern Retail that Etsy uses a combination of\nautomatic controls, manual review and flags from users to monitor listings and\nreview policy violations. The company also cited soon-to-be-released data from\nits annual Transparency Report in which Etsy upped the number of items it took\ndown, as well as the number of sellers it suspended in violation of its rules.\n\nThe spokesperson also said that Etsy recently expanded its team of content\nmoderators and strengthened its automated detection systems to find and remove\nlistings that violate rules around resold items or mass merchandise.\n\n## A growing SEO drumbeat\n\nAs mentioned in Etsy\u2019s terms of use, sellers have freedom with their product\ndescriptions and how they choose to lay out their listings. But not all\ndescriptions seem to reflect what\u2019s being offered \u2014 a point some competing\nsellers say puts them at a disadvantage.\n\nWhen scrolling through Etsy, Modern Retail came across instances of product\nlistings peppered with similar but unrelated buzzwords. A journal, for\nexample, was listed as a journal, but also as a sketchbook, kids\u2019 art, a gift\nand personalized drawings. A necklace was listed as being \u201crainbow,\u201d but its\nstones come in one color, depending on what option a buyer picks.\n\nWhen a listing title includes the same keywords over and over again, this is\nknown as \u201ckeyword stuffing.\u201d In a recent Etsy-led Q&A, Andrew Stanton,\ndirector of search at Etsy, acknowledged this happens on the platform but\nwarned: \u201cKeyword stuffing does not help you on Etsy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe very thoughtful about those titles,\u201d he said. \u201cMake sure it\u2019s factual,\nmake sure it\u2019s relevant... [and] make sure that all the descriptors you use in\nthat title are true to your listing.\u201d\n\nEtsy\u2019s approach to SEO is somewhat similar to Amazon\u2019s. Picking the right\nkeywords for listings is critically important, and both platforms allow\nsellers to pay to advertise their products in search results and other pages.\nBut for sellers who don\u2019t use ads, knowing which keywords get results becomes\neven more important, Etsy sellers told Modern Retail.\n\n\u201cThe reason we\u2019re all on Etsy and not on our own websites is for the exposure,\nbecause at the end of the day, it\u2019s a search engine,\u201d the anonymous seller\ntold Modern Retail.\n\n\u201cIf you know how to use [SEO], you can be seen more, but it kind of sucks for\npeople like me who want to sell items, but don\u2019t really understand it, and\nthen our stuff gets pushed to the bottom,\u201d Carissa Hawkes, who sells reworked\nclothes on various platforms including Etsy, said.\n\nAn Etsy spokesperson told Modern Retail that the platform provides sellers\nwith search resources, including its Ultimate Guide to Etsy Search. They added\nthat the platform hosts webinars and live listing critique sessions for\nsellers to get feedback and advice from Etsy employees on how to improve\nlistings.\n\n## Handmade versus non-handmade\n\nMuch of what\u2019s sold on Etsy is labeled as \u201chandmade,\u201d but some sellers appear\nto take creative liberties with that term.\n\nSome of these listings say the goods can be customized \u2014 which falls under\nEtsy\u2019s dropshipping rules for handmade items \u2014 but others look as they would\non the brand\u2019s website without any added designs or personalized features. For\nexample, Modern Retail found instances of Stanley tumblers being listed on\nEtsy as \u201chandmade,\u201d although they had pictures of the products in their\noriginal packaging. (Several of these listings were also taken down after\nModern Retail flagged them to Etsy\u2019s team.)\n\nEtsy says that it bars sellers from listing \u201cfalse, inaccurate or misleading\ninformation\u201d in listings and that it may suspend or terminate accounts that do\nso. On an earnings call in November, Etsy\u2019s leadership mentioned that it saw a\n120% spike in \u201chandmade\u201d items taken down during the third quarter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m... pleased to say that in just a few months of work, we\u2019ve nearly cut in\nhalf the percentage of visits where a buyer comes across a violating listing\nbased on our constant sampling of the marketplace,\u201d Silverman, the CEO, said.\n\u201cWhile buyers don\u2019t come to Etsy looking for mass-manufactured merchandise,\nit\u2019s critical we do an ever-better job elevating the best of Etsy to keep Etsy\nspecial in the minds of our buyers and sellers.\u201d\n\nAccording to Etsy\u2019s soon-to-be-released 2023 Transparency Report, Etsy removed\nfour times as many listings and suspended two times as many sellers for\nviolating its handmade policy in 2023 than it did in 2022.\n\n## Fee trouble\n\nAnother issue sellers tell Modern Retail they are running into is fees. In\nFebruary, Etsy began charging new sellers $15 to set up a shop on the site.\n\nIn addition, when Etsy sellers sell an item, they have to pay a transaction\nfee of 6.5%. Etsy raised this percentage from 5% in February 2022. At the\ntime, some sellers went on strike, saying the hike would negatively affect\ntheir businesses and ability to make a profit.\n\nWhile transaction fees aren\u2019t unusual, some platforms have nixed them to\nappeal to cash-strapped sellers. Mercari, for instance, previously had a 10%\nflat commission for every sale made on the platform but eliminated the fee\nentirely earlier this year.\n\nEtsy sellers have voiced concerns about fees for many years. One seller told\nModern Retail in 2022, \u201cWhen I opened my shop about seven years ago, the fees\nwere minimal. But now I\u2019m finding myself coming up short after every sale.\u201d\n\nMendez, the former Etsy seller, opened a store during the pandemic in 2020. At\nthe time, she said, her friend had started selling on Etsy and recommended\nthat Mendez post some of her journals and stickers for sale as well. \u201cI\ncreated the account, but the moment I saw the amount of fees they had, I just\nautomatically thought, \u2018This isn\u2019t worth it,'\u201d Mendez told Modern Retail.\n\nMendez ended up running the store for a few months before getting off of Etsy.\nShe has friends who remain on the platform but she described them as \u201csuper\ndiscouraged.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the time they make earrings and sell them, they\u2019re not making much,\u201d\nMendez said. \u201cBut because they make handmade crafts, they don\u2019t know where\nelse to post them, because there\u2019s not really another website or app out there\nthat caters to that like Etsy.\u201d Mendez said some of her friends who remain on\nEtsy have cut the number of listings they have in half.\n\nSellers also told Modern Retail they\u2019re upset about listing fees. For years,\nEtsy has asked sellers to pay $0.20 for each item they list on the platform or\napp. This fee exists regardless of whether sellers manage to sell the item.\nEtsy.com listings expire after four months, but sellers can pay another $0.20\nper listing to have them renewed. There is no fee for editing an existing\nlisting.\n\nHawkes, who makes reworked clothing, set up a shop on Etsy five years ago. She\nused to post dozens of items a year but now has no active listings. \u201cI was\nlike, \u2018I need to go on a platform where my listing can just sit there and not\ncollect fees,'\u201d she said. On Etsy, \u201cI wasn\u2019t selling enough and I kept losing\nmoney.\u201d\n\nHawkes soon moved to the fashion marketplace Depop, as well as the thrifted\nfashion app Teleport. Depop, founded in 2011, has 35 million registered users.\nIn 2021, Etsy acquired Depop for $1.6 billion. Unlike its parent company,\nthough, Depop has a different fee structure. For instance, Depop sellers can\nlist items for free. (An Etsy spokesperson contacted for this piece stressed\nthat while Depop has no listing fee, it passes the fee onto buyers.)\n\nOther e-commerce platforms have done away with seller fees. Teleport, per its\ndescription in the Apple Store, \u201chas zero selling fees so you keep 100% of\nwhat you earn.\u201d Hawkes averaged about 10 sales a year on Etsy but managed to\nsurpass that on Teleport in her first year on the platform. Mendez began\nselling thrifted clothing on Teleport in January 2023 and \u201cstarted getting\nsales right away,\u201d she said.\n\nMendez also uses Jamble, a live shopping and resale app based in France.\nSellers don\u2019t have to pay to list on Jamble, but this is \u201csubject to vary over\ntime,\u201d per the company\u2019s terms of use. Jamble is home to some 700,000\nlistings, according to its website.\n\nDepop, Teleport and Jamble mainly carry fashion, but additional platforms are\npopping up as alternatives to Etsy. These include Michaels MakerPlace, Artisan\nCooperative and Handmade.com. Handmade founder and CEO Roberto Milk told\nModern Retail the platform was built specifically for those selling handmade\ngoods, and that it prohibits mass-produced products and listings by\ndropshippers.\n\nThe rise of these apps, coupled with sellers\u2019 growing discontent, means a\nchange may be on the horizon. Mendez told Modern Retail she is already having\na better experience selling on these challenger platforms.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t buy anything from Etsy anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I\ndo find something on Etsy that I like, I actually try to contact the seller\nthrough Instagram or something to try to help them maintain more of the fees.\u201d\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\n## More in Technology\n\nDigital Marketing Redux\n\n#### Banks are dipping their toes into the retail media waters\n\nApril 19, 2024 \u25a0 4 min read\n\nAdd financial institutions to the list of companies piling into the retail\nmedia business.
