Idea\n\nWhat are called the standard conjectures on algebraic cycles are several\nconjectures brought up by Grothendieck, concerned with the relation between\nalgebraic cycles and Weil cohomology theories.\n\n\u201cThe first (Lefschetz standard conjecture) is an existence assertion for\nalgebraic cycles, the second (Hodge standard conjecture) is a statement of\npositivity, generalising Weil\u2019s well-known positivity theorem in the theory of\nabelian varieties\u201d (Grothendieck - 68).\n\n\u201cBut in the category of pure motives, from the start one dealt only with\nalgebraic cycles, represented by correspondences, and it was intuitively not\nat all clear how on earth they could convey information about transcendental\ncycles. Indeed, the main function of the \u201dStandard Conjectures\u201c was to serve\nas a convenient bridge from algebraic to transcendental. Everything that one\ncould prove without them was indeed \u201dplus ou moins trivial\u201c \u2013 until people\nstarted treating correspondences themselves using sophisticated homological\nalgebra (partly generated by the development of \u0301\u00e9tale cohomology and\nGrothendieck\u2013Verdier\u2019s introduction of derived and triangulated categories).\n(Y. Manin - 2014).\n\nThey were also followed by the Beilinson conjectures\u201c.\n\n## 2\\. Conclusions\n\nThe proof of the two standard conjectures would yield results going\nconsiderably further than Weil\u2019s conjectures. They would form the basis of the\nso-called \u201ctheory of motives\u201d which is a systematic theory of \u201carithmetic\nproperties\u201d of algebraic variety(ies), as embodied in their groups of classes\nof cycles for numerical equivalence. We have at present only a very small part\nof this theory in dimension one, as contained in the theory of abelian\nvariety(ies). Alongside the problem of resolution of singularities, the proof\nof the standard conjectures seems to me to be the most urgent task in\nalgebraic geometry. (Grothendieck - 68)\n\n## 3\\.
