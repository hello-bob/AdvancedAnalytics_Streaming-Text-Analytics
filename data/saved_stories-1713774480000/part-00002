Source: Unsplash\n\nThe essay that follows is adapted from remarks delivered by the author to the\n19th Annual Senior College Symposium at the University of Toronto Faculty Club\non April 17, 2024.\n\nI\u2019ve worn a lot of different hats during my years as a journalist. I never\nplanned or expected to be a managing editor at a newspaper, or a magazine\neditor, or a podcaster. It all happened more or less by chance.\n\nMy main writing role at Quillette, as an investigative reporter focusing\nlargely on scandals in higher education, is a case in point. I never set out\nto be an investigative reporter, let alone a specialist in stories about\nuniversities. It just happened by accident when sources started coming to me\nwith stories that no one else was investigating.\n\nSince joining Quillette in 2017, I\u2019ve worked on dozens of investigative\nstories about ideological radicalization on campuses, both as a writer and as\nan editor. Since I don\u2019t have time to discuss them all, I will focus on one\nparticularly interesting case study involving McMaster University in Hamilton,\nOntario.\n\nAs many of you know, in 2020, McMaster became consumed with explosive\naccusations about an alleged sex-ring being run out of the school\u2019s psychology\ndepartment. According to these accusations, multiple professors were involved\nin a vast Jeffrey Epstein-like sex conspiracy involving gang rape and\nelectronic mind-control devices.\n\nMcMaster\u2019s Imaginary Sex Ring\n\nIn 2020, a Canadian university tore up its psychology department in search of\na non-existent network of sexual predators. Documents obtained by Quillette\nreveal how administrators allowed it to happen.\n\nQuilletteJonathan Kay\n\nAt the height of the resulting social panic, which I documented last year in a\n12,000-word investigative report for Quillette, no fewer than seven members of\nthe school\u2019s psychology department were under investigation. Several of them\nwere banned from campus for months\u2014including two women, who were falsely\naccused of being complicit in luring unsuspecting victims to home sex\ndungeons.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, posters were put up on campus to alert everyone about how\ndangerous these supposed sex predators were. Most scandalous of all, the\npresident of the university himself\u2014a man named David Farrar\u2014sent out a\ncampus-wide email blast suggesting these accusations might be well founded.\n\nAs most of you know, perhaps from reading about the details here in Quillette,\nit turned out that the entire sex-ring story was fabricated.\n\nAs my investigation showed, the lurid group-sex allegations originated with\ntwo women\u2014one of whom would eventually have her claims completely discredited\nin open court, while the other later confessed that she\u2019d hallucinated the\nwhole thing while enduring a psychotic episode and binge-watching the Jeffrey\nEpstein documentary on Netflix.\n\nMcMaster officials\u2014including not only Farrar, but also provost Susan Tighe and\nthe vice-president for DEI, a self-described \u201cradicalized queer woman\u201d named\nArig al Shaibah\u2014all had reason to be aware of the ludicrous nature of these\nhorror-movie allegations.\n\nWe know this because the details were later discovered by an external\ninvestigator, though they were mostly kept under wraps by the university until\nQuillette got access to the documents and interviews we needed to blow the\nstory wide open.\n\nAnd as shocking as all these details are, perhaps the most interesting part of\nthe tale is the fact that Quillette got this scoop in the first place.\n\nSeveral of the McMaster sources I spoke to\u2014these being the scholars in the\npsychology department who trusted me with this story\u2014candidly informed me that\nQuillette hadn\u2019t been their first choice as the media outlet to get this\nscoop.\n\nAnd why would it be? Quillette isn\u2019t even a Canadian-based publication. We\u2019re\nbased in Australia, on the other side of the planet.\n\nHowever, my sources couldn\u2019t get Canadian outlets to return their phone calls\nand emails, because the scoop they were offering didn\u2019t fit into the preferred\nideological narrative of most Canadian publications.\n\nFor years, activists and their journalistic allies had been telling Canadians\nthat campus life in this country is suffused with what is sometimes called\n\u201crape culture.\u201d The truth about what happened at McMaster ran directly against\nthat rape-culture narrative. That is likely the reason why the most logical\noutlet to have broken this story, Hamilton\u2019s own Spectator newspaper, didn\u2019t\npublish this scoop\u2014and, in fact, probably didn\u2019t want this scoop.\n\nJust the opposite, in fact: The Spectator ran a massive 5,400-word article\nthat actually encouraged the social panic at McMaster\u2014an article based\nentirely on the claims of the sex-ring accuser whose narrative was\nsubsequently shredded under cross-examination in court.\n\nFor the Spectator to then admit to its readers the truth of what actually\nhappened at McMaster would have been mortifying. And so, it fell to\nQuillette\u2014a publication based more than 15,000 kilometres from the McMaster\ncampus\u2014to explain what really happened.\n\nWhen I began my career in journalism in the late 1990s, pretty much every\ninvestigative reporter in the country would have been eager to get a scoop\nlike this\u2014especially since it would have offered them a chance to skewer the\nwell-paid university administrators who\u2019d stoked McMaster\u2019s social panic in\nthe first place.\n\nWe ink-stained wretches once imagined that our job was to afflict the\ncomfortable and comfort the afflicted, as the expression goes. But that\u2019s\nchanged, because what\u2019s more important to many of my journalistic colleagues\nnow is to demonstrate ideological solidarity with the other university-\neducated white-collar progressives who populate their social-media silos.\n\nSo instead of afflicting the comfortable, we make common cause with other\nprivileged elites and kick down at the working classes\u2014the ones who don\u2019t\nshare pronouns and haven\u2019t done implicit-bias training.\n\nIn the early days of my career\u2014this would be the late 1990s, before the dawn\nof social media\u2014journalists exhibited plenty of tribalism and status-seeking.\nBut it was a form of tribalism and status-seeking that was mediated by\ncorporate affiliation. Which is to say that it was my newspaper against\nyours\u2014not my hashtags against your hashtags.\n\nAt the National Post, where I began my career, we\u2019d gnash our teeth if the\nGlobe & Mail got a scoop that we\u2019d missed. And vice versa. So when people\ntalked about the \u201cnewspaper wars,\u201d they meant (metaphorical) wars between\nnewspapers. In the age of Twitter, on the other hand, these wars are now more\nlikely to be civil wars fought within media outlets\u2014such as the one now\nplaying out at NPR\u2014pitting younger ideological puritans against more liberally\nminded veterans.\n\nNPR suspends veteran editor as it grapples with his public criticism\n\nNPR has suspended Senior Editor Uri Berliner after he wrote an essay accusing\nthe public radio network of becoming too progressive in its news coverage and\nlosing the public\u2019s trust.\n\nNPRDavid Folkenflik\n\nAnd this is one of the main reasons why it\u2019s now more difficult to get\nreporters to cover stories that don\u2019t align with fashionable ideological\npostures: Even smart, fair-minded journalists who want to pursue these stories\nfear that doing so will open them up to accusations that they are political\nheretics, or, more ominously, that they are \u201con the wrong side of history.\u201d\n\nNow, when I discuss this kind of issue on social media, as I am sometimes wont\nto do, I often hear from conservatives who will insist that the solution to\nthis is simply for young journalists to exhibit more \u201ccourage.\u201d But life isn\u2019t\nthat simple. We\u2019re not characters in an Ayn Rand novel. Humans are social\ncreatures who crave the approval of their peers. And so I can understand why\nyoung journalists self-censor.\n\nPut yourself in their shoes. All throughout their lives, leading up to the\ntime they first walk into a newsroom as cub reporters, these young journalists\nhave been told that being on the side of angels means believing women,\nuncritically amplifying the voices of black and Indigenous people, working on\nyour reconciliation, and reciting rainbow mantras like \u201cTrans women are\nwomen.\u201d They\u2019ve been told that everyone has their own truth, that reality is\nsubjective, and that believing otherwise is a sign of white privilege or\nworse.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, they\u2019re immersed in a professional journalistic\nenvironment whose traditional posture is one of distrust, of scepticism, of\nasking hard questions, of demanding proof, of taking a story wherever it leads\nyou\u2014and, most importantly, of reporting objective facts that may in some cases\nrun afoul of people\u2019s subjective feelings.\n\nWhich is to say that the professional qualities required of a good\ninvestigative reporter are now completely at odds with the values that many\ncollege graduates come to the job market with. The result can be a profound\nsense of cognitive dissonance, and the only way to avoid that dissonance is to\nwalk away from stories that are ideologically off-message.\n\nI briefly served as editor-in-chief for a progressive arts-and-activism\nmagazine based in Toronto. What I saw was a lot of young journalists who\nweren\u2019t getting paid a lot of money, and who knew that someday, in order to\npay the bills, they\u2019d need to get book deals, or get adjunct professor gigs,\nor apply for government grants of one kind or another, or take on professional\nroles at literary festivals and arts councils. They didn\u2019t want to compromise\nthose dreams by writing or editing stories that were seen as problematic by\nthe highly progressive power-brokers who acted as gatekeepers in those areas.\n\nJonathan Kay: Why I quit The Walrus for an exciting new future of reckless\ncommentary at Taco Barn\n\nA big chunk of me simply never left the National Post \u2014 where I\u2019d worked for\n16 years, and which I still love, because it remains the only major media\noutlet...\n\nNational PostJonathan Kay\n\nThe pity of it is that many of these people I am describing are quite\nbrilliant\u2014certainly smarter than me, and at least equally capable of writing\nthe kind of investigative stories that have become my bread and butter at\nQuillette. But they don\u2019t feel like they have the freedom to take that kind of\nrisk. And given the ideologically monolithic environment in which they\noperate, I can\u2019t say I blame them.\n\nFor all its progressive ideological manias, Canada remains a fundamentally\nconservative country in its social and professional reflexes. We don\u2019t like\noutliers or apostates. To be stunning and brave in Canadian journalistic\ncircles these days is, for the most part, to stunningly and bravely say the\nsame thing that everyone else is saying.\n\n> To be stunning and brave in Canadian journalistic circles these days is, for\n> the most part, to stunningly and bravely say the same thing that everyone\n> else is saying\n\nOne thing I should emphasise here is that I\u2019m not complaining about any of\nthis on a personal level. Nor have I ever complained about being \u201ccancelled.\u201d\nJust the opposite: To reiterate, the phenomenon I\u2019m describing here is the\nmain reason I\u2019ve landed so many Canadian scoops for Quillette. In a country of\n40 million people, I\u2019ve become one of the only avenues that academics have to\neducate the country about the radicalism playing out on their campuses. I\u2019m\nnot a victim of \u201cwokeness\u201d\u2014to the extent that term has any meaning\u2014but rather\none of its biggest Canadian profiteers.\n\nHow a Single Anonymous Twitter Account Caused an \u2018Indigenized\u2019 Canadian\nUniversity to Unravel\n\nThe main beneficiaries are more likely to be privileged administrators who\nburnish their bona fides by filling alumni magazines and email blasts with\nIndigenous photo-ops.\n\nQuilletteJonathan Kay\n\nAnother example: In 2021, 53 top Canadian academic administrators convened in\nOttawa for the biannual membership meeting of something called Universities\nCanada, a lobby group dedicated to \u201cproviding university presidents with a\nunified voice for higher education.\u201d One of those university presidents was so\nappalled by the 89-page meeting agenda that they decided to leak it to me; as\nit contained an alarming blueprint to create a DEI commissariat on every\ncampus in Canada whose agents would be embedded in every facet of university\nlife.\n\nIt was an explosive document, and the story I wrote about it was a scoop that\nwent viral. But again, I want you to think about this: The only journalist\nthat this university president could trust to write about this scoop was\nsomeone who works for an outlet whose headquarters is a 22-hour plane ride\naway.\n\nAnti-Racism as Office-Politics Power Play: a Canadian Academic Case Study\n\nLast week, 53 top Canadian academic administrators convened in Ottawa for a\nbiannual membership meeting of Universities Canada [https://www.univcan.ca/],\na group dedicated to \u201cproviding university presidents with a unified voice for\nhigher education.\u201d The 89-page meeting agenda, which was leaked to me after\nthe event, makes for\n\nQuilletteJonathan Kay\n\nIt should be said that, despite the financially strained state of Canada\u2019s\nnews media, there are still a good number of reporters in this country who\nregularly cover the education beat. But what does it mean to \u201ccover\u201d the\neducation beat in 2024? It often means on-boarding ideas from the army of\ncommunications staffers whom universities now employ to promote puff pieces\nabout their celebrity scholars or their latest DEI campaign.\n\nIf you\u2019re an education reporter worried about how you\u2019re going to survive the\nnext round of layoffs at your newspaper, your survival plan could very well\ninvolve becoming assistant VP of communications or some such at a local\ncollege or university. And you\u2019re not going to get a gig like that by blowing\nthe lid off a campus scandal.\n\nAnd so when scandal is brewing, the beat education reporters sometimes get\nbypassed and the scoops come to me. These days, in fact, I\u2019m deluged with so\nmany campus news tips that I can only write up a small fraction as proper\narticles. In many cases, I simply take the leaked documents, verify their\nauthenticity, and then put them on social media, since they usually speak for\nthemselves.\n\n> BREAKING: Following the public release of its manifesto accusing Israel of\n> genocide, \u201ceducide,\u201d \u201cscholasticide,\u201d & \u201cepistemicide,\u201d the @TorontoMet\n> Sociology dept. is hunting for the \u201cZios\u201d & those with \u201cZionist sympathies\u201d\n> who may have helped me commit my act of Twittercide https://t.co/SjxzJeGYoc\n> pic.twitter.com/gGnnfNz6M1\n>\n> \u2014 Jonathan Kay (@jonkay) April 3, 2024\n\nIn the days leading up to this speaking event, for instance, I posted\ndocuments from Toronto Metropolitan University\u2019s sociology department\nindicating that various scholars there were engaged in an internal witch hunt\nfor Zionists\u2014or what one of them charmingly referred to as \u201cZios.\u201d I also got\ndocuments from York University, where a \u201cPalestinian Solidarity Committee\u201d is\nproposing to eliminate anonymous faculty voting so that its members can\nidentify and punish anyone who votes against their wishes.\n\n> the @YorkUniversity Politics dept \"Palestine Solidarity Committee\"\n> pronounces Zionism \"a settler colonial project...that upholds global white\n> supremacy\" It also wants to abolish anonymous faculty voting, so it can\n> punish Zionists & other foes of \"anti-racism\" for crimes vs DEI\n> pic.twitter.com/Km2gQhm5MY\n>\n> \u2014 Jonathan Kay (@jonkay) April 12, 2024\n\nThe question then becomes: What do we do about all this? How do we get more\nreporters to shine a light on the illiberal ideological movements that have\ntaken over many academic subcultures?\n\nThe good news is that Quillette isn\u2019t alone. In recent years, we\u2019ve been\njoined by other liberal and centrist voices such as The Free Press and, here\nin Canada, The Hub\u2014outlets that sit outside the suffocating group-think of\nlegacy media. I should also say that some elements of the legacy media have\nalso remained welcoming places for heterodox thinkers\u2014including the National\nPost.\n\nBut in academia, the problem of tribal progressive group-think is going to be\nmore difficult to solve, because the barriers to entry are prohibitive. While\nmy boss, Claire Lehmann, was able to start up Quillette a decade ago with no\ninitial cash outlay except that required to secure the internet domain name,\nno one in this room has the means to go out and start up their own university.\nSo the solution has to be reforming what we already have.\n\nAnd on this score, one thing I want to make clear is that I\u2019m not arguing that\nwe need universities to become conservative or even centrist institutions. As\nI see it, academic life naturally attracts the kind of person who is an\nidealist, maybe even a utopian\u2014people who are smart enough to make a lot of\nmoney as, say, lawyers or entrepreneurs, but who pick the ivory tower anyway.\nThat sort of self-selected person, who picks the search for truth over the\nquest for cash, is always going to be disproportionately likely to be\nprogressive in his or her politics.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s worth mentioning that in most of the investigative stories I\u2019ve\ndone, the ideological radicalism and scandalous behaviour at play wasn\u2019t\ncoming from academics. In most cases, it originated with administrators. At\nMcMaster, it wasn\u2019t some cabal of professors who sent the campus spiralling\ninto sex-ring paranoia, but the president and those serving him. And one\nreason for this is that these administrators are all playing with house money.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read my Quillette stories about McMaster, you\u2019ll know that I was\nunable to provide even a rough estimate of how many millions of dollars David\nFarrar and his colleagues shovelled out the door to three different law firms\nin an effort to do damage control on the hysteria they unleashed. These are\nthe same administrators who constantly play the poverty card when departments\ncome to them for a new hire, yet seem to have access to limitless funds when\nlawyers, consultants, or spin doctors are required to clean up some mess\nthey\u2019ve left in the C-suite.\n\nThe other tactic that university administrators have adopted effectively is to\ncleverly deflect legitimate criticism by shrouding themselves in the social-\njustice sloganeering that formerly was the exclusive idiom of their activist\ncritics.\n\nAt McMaster, for instance, when anyone tried to take Farrar and his team to\ntask for their incompetence, these senior administrators would simply recite\nthe slogan that they\u2019d taken a \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d approach to the sex-abuse\nclaims made against the psychology department\u2014a nice-sounding phrase that, as\nI wrote in my article, became a cynical dodge. Essentially, it gave them a\ncarte blanche excuse for assigning credibility to even the most absurd\nallegations.\n\nAnd for all the talk we hear from progressives about holding powerful actors\n\u201caccountable\u201d for their actions and views, those university corner offices are\nthe lands that accountability forgot. David Farrar is still the president of\nMcMaster. Susan Tighe is still the provost. As for Arig al-Shaibah, the DEI\nchief, she got out of Dodge as soon as the magnitude of McMaster\u2019s epic screw-\nup became apparent. But she paid no real price for what happened. Just the\nopposite: She\u2019s now running the DEI show at UBC, on the other side of the\ncountry.\n\n> Canadian academia is now a world where you can lose your job for stating\n> impolitic truths, while paying no price whatsoever for reciting fashionable\n> lies.\n\nAnd speaking of UBC, who remembers that university\u2019s absolutely unconscionable\ntreatment of creative writing professor Steven Galloway, who was falsely\naccused of rape and thrown off campus without any kind of due process?\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for the blockbuster investigative report written about his case\nin Quillette by writer Brad Cran, and Galloway\u2019s follow-up defamation suit\nagainst his false accusers, a majority of Canadians might still imagine that\nGalloway was guilty.\n\nDid a single UBC official or false accuser among the faculty pay any kind of\nprice for engineering this travesty? Not to my knowledge. Canadian academia is\nnow a world where you can lose your job for stating impolitic truths, while\npaying no price whatsoever for reciting fashionable lies.\n\nA Literary Inquisition: How Novelist Steven Galloway Was Smeared as a Rapist,\nEven as the Case Against Him Collapsed\n\nAlthough no single person was to blame for what had happened, she concluded,\nthe school as a whole hadn\u2019t done enough to protect Berdahl.\n\nQuilletteBrad Cran\n\nThe irony, of course, is that UBC\u2014like McMaster and the University of\nToronto\u2014is stacked with people who understand the lessons of history, the\nlessons of organisational behaviour, the lessons of political science, the\nlessons of sound epistemology, more than ordinary laypeople such as myself. In\nall of these fields of study, it\u2019s well known that every institution under the\nsun will inevitably become ineffective and corrupt if its internal workings\nlack checks and balances, or if it falls under the sway of cult-like belief\nsystems deemed to be unfalsifiable.\n\nOne might have therefore hoped that Canadian academics, of all people, would\nbe warning us of these age-old institutional pitfalls\u2014instead of supplying us\nwith the endless stream of sad cautionary tales that I have chronicled at\nQuillette.\n\n  * Higher Education\n  * Canada\n  * Ideology\n  * journalism\n\n### Jonathan Kay\n\nJonathan Kay is a Quillette editor, podcaster, and advisor to The Foundation\nAgainst Intolerance and Racism.
