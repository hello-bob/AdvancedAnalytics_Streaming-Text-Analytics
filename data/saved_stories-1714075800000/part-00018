We talk about the many\nproblems with the system of schooling \u2014 the standardization, the passive\ninertness of classrooms, the outdated factory model of education. While all of\nthat is true, it can seem too abstract. Here's a lovely video that discusses\nall of these problems.\n\nSo, there you have it. Schools suck. The schooling system sucks. But what do\nwe replace it with? That's the problem that we find ourselves solving. At the\nheart of the change we seek to bring is the philosophy and approach to\nlearning itself. We cannot merely shout out playful learning and snap our\nfingers to make it happen. While kids, with their immense capacity to soak in\nanything anywhere, do make it easy, we still need to translate this philosophy\ninto practice.\n\nHere are a few things we try to live by, and why. We are including a few links\nto books we love, in case you are interested in exploring more.\n\nPlayful learning means that we allow for kids' bodies and minds to wander, get\ndistracted, ask questions if seemingly irrelevant, explore why this way, and\nwhy not that way.\n\nWe understand that learning is not just cognitive, but it is always emotional\nand often social. To learn something, we must find value in it. We do not\nfocus only on intellectual content. We also prioritize creating positive\nemotional experiences and fostering social connections in learning. And\nemotion is not just the overt kind, but also the long-term feelings and\nattitudes one develops for any pursuit.\n\n> They fail because they are afraid, bored, and confused. They are afraid,\n> above all else, of failing, of disappointing or displeasing the many anxious\n> adults around them, whose limitless hopes and expectations for them hang\n> over their heads like a cloud.\n\n\u2014 How Children Fail by John Holt\n\nWe pick themes and tie activities to these themes because they allow the kids\nto see how things they are learning are meaningfully connected. We do not\nteach subjects in isolation without connecting them to a larger context or\ntheme.\n\nWe also try not to introduce labels or terms or jargon first. We instead give\nthem examples they understand, and then allow them to learn the labels later,\nconnecting them to what they now know.\n\n> A certain amount of learning about, just like a certain amount of elements\n> first, is fine. The problem is overdoing it. The problem is endless learning\n> about something without ever getting better at doing it. So, to parallel\n> elementitis, I like to call endless learning about aboutitis. Yes, it lets\n> learners acquire some information about the French Revolution and the\n> American Revolution, mitosis and meiosis, the positions of the planets,\n> continental drift, and the tensions of race and status in Othello. But this\n> only provides a kind of informational backdrop rather than an empowering and\n> enlightening body of understanding.\n\n> I thought over my undergraduate and graduate experience at MIT and realized\n> something that surprised me at the time and has stayed with me ever since:\n> In my technical courses, I had rarely done anything but solve problems. I\n> almost always succeeded, but the problems came from the text or the\n> instructors. I had never undertaken anything like a project or an open-ended\n> investigation. The consequence was inevitable: I had a fierce battery of\n> problem-solving skills and hardly any problem-finding skills.\n\n\u2014 Making Learning Whole by David Perkins\n\nWe tie the learning to their (our) world. This again means showing examples.\nWe constantly remind ourselves that there is a big difference between showing\nexamples (doing or demonstrating) and giving examples (explaining or\ndiscussing).\n\nWe understand that it is entirely okay if they don't get it now. There is\nplenty of time. Learning is nonlinear. What seems hard now can become easy 6\nmonths or 1 year later because their brains and brain regions are growing - at\ntheir own unique pace.\n\n> So our job as parents is not to make a particular kind of child. Instead,\n> our job is to provide a protected space of love, safety, and stability in\n> which children of many unpredictable kinds can flourish. Our job is not to\n> shape our children's minds; it's to let those minds explore all the\n> possibilities that the world allows. Our job is not to tell children how to\n> play; it's to give them the toys and pick the toys up again after the kids\n> are done. We can't make children learn, but we can let them learn.\n\n\u2014 The Gardener and the Carpenter by Alison Gopnik\n\nWe always try to do and demonstrate, not talk and teach. When doing\nactivities, we try to remember we often don't need to talk or explain it\nfirst. We do it as we are setting up and doing. Doing is far more engaging for\nchildren than listening to us talk.\n\n> Most schools in most countries place a higher priority on teaching students\n> to follow instructions and rules (becoming A students) than on helping\n> students develop their own ideas, goals, and strategies\n\n\u2014 Lifelong Kindergarten by Mitchell Resnick\n\nWe remind ourselves that real understanding takes two things: conceptual\ninsight and procedural fluency. Both are important. But we should not teach\nthem procedures alone. We cannot say things like \"Because this is important\nlater in life\". It's on us to show how it is important, and useful, and fun.\n\nProcedural fluency can only happen with practice. But we cannot force\npractice. Instead, we offer opportunities. Forcing it is counterproductive, as\nit can result in negative long-term attitudes like aversion and dislike (like\nthe most common one, which you've probably witnessed, an intense dislike for\nmaths).\n\n> We have forgotten that children are designed by nature to learn through\n> self-directed play and exploration, and so, more and more, we deprive them\n> of freedom to learn, subjecting them instead to the tedious and painfully\n> slow learning methods devised by those who run the schools.\n\nFree To Learn by Peter Gray\n\nThese are are some of the principles we try to live by. Here are a few books\nthat have helped us understand why these principles matter and how we might\ntranslate them into effective practice.\n\nCreative Schools by Ken Robinson\n\nFree at Last: The Sudbury Valley School by Daniel Greenberg (Many parents\nworry about what kids might learn or not learn if left to their own devices.\nIf you do, please read this one.)\n\nGrit by Angela Duckworth\n\nHome Learning Year by Year by Rebecca Rupp\n\nMindset by Carol Dweck\n\nThe School of Life by Alain de Botton\n\nThe Unschooling Unmanual (This is a short collection of essays. The best one,\nwhich we recommend very highly, is Schooling: The Hidden Agenda. It is the\ntranscript of a talk given by the writer Daniel Quinn and is available\nonline.)\n\nWhat books would you recommend? Please tell us in the comments!\n\nMany alternative schools have similar origin stories, of parents rediscovering\nthe flaws of our schooling system. Precious few, however, are able to scale\nbecause applying these principles is hard. Where we think we are different is\nwe believe the right use of technology can help make this learning possible\nwhile empowering all the humans in the loop.\n\n### Subscribe to Life @ Comini\n\nBy Learning @ Comini \u00b7 Launched 3 months ago\n\nAn alternative PLAYschool for 2-6 year olds and a microschool for 7+ year olds\nlocated in Bandra, Mumbai.
