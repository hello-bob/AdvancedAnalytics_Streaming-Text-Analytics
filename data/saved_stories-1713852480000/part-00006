The probe and its twin, Voyager 2, are the only spacecraft to ever fly\nin interstellar space (the space between stars).\n\nVoyager 1 stopped sending readable science and engineering data back to Earth\non Nov. 14, 2023, even though mission controllers could tell the spacecraft\nwas still receiving their commands and otherwise operating normally. In March,\nthe Voyager engineering team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern\nCalifornia confirmed that the issue was tied to one of the spacecraft\u2019s three\nonboard computers, called the flight data subsystem (FDS). The FDS is\nresponsible for packaging the science and engineering data before it\u2019s sent to\nEarth.\n\nAfter receiving data about the health and status of Voyager 1 for the first\ntime in five months, members of the Voyager flight team celebrate in a\nconference room at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on April 20.\n\nCredit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe team discovered that a single chip responsible for storing a portion of\nthe FDS memory \u2014 including some of the FDS computer\u2019s software code \u2014 isn\u2019t\nworking. The loss of that code rendered the science and engineering data\nunusable. Unable to repair the chip, the team decided to place the affected\ncode elsewhere in the FDS memory. But no single location is large enough to\nhold the section of code in its entirety.\n\nSo they devised a plan to divide the affected code into sections and store\nthose sections in different places in the FDS. To make this plan work, they\nalso needed to adjust those code sections to ensure, for example, that they\nall still function as a whole. Any references to the location of that code in\nother parts of the FDS memory needed to be updated as well.\n\nThe team started by singling out the code responsible for packaging the\nspacecraft\u2019s engineering data. They sent it to its new location in the FDS\nmemory on April 18. A radio signal takes about 22 1\u20442 hours to reach Voyager\n1, which is over 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from Earth, and\nanother 22 1\u20442 hours for a signal to come back to Earth. When the mission\nflight team heard back from the spacecraft on April 20, they saw that the\nmodification worked: For the first time in five months, they have been able to\ncheck the health and status of the spacecraft.\n\nGet the Latest News from the Final Frontier\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE JPL NEWSLETTER\n\nDuring the coming weeks, the team will relocate and adjust the other affected\nportions of the FDS software. These include the portions that will start\nreturning science data.\n\nVoyager 2 continues to operate normally. Launched over 46 years ago, the twin\nVoyager spacecraft are the longest-running and most distant spacecraft in\nhistory. Before the start of their interstellar exploration, both probes flew\nby Saturn and Jupiter, and Voyager 2 flew by Uranus and Neptune.\n\nCaltech in Pasadena, California, manages JPL for NASA.\n\n## News Media Contact\n\nCalla Cofield\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n\n626-808-2469\n\ncalla.e.cofield@jpl.nasa.gov\n\n2024-046\n\nAbout JPL\n\nWho We Are\n\nExecutive Council\n\nDirectors\n\nCareers\n\nInternships\n\nThe JPL Story\n\nJPL Achievements\n\nDocumentary Series\n\nJPL Annual Report\n\nJPL Plan: 2023-2026\n\nMissions\n\nCurrent\n\nPast\n\nFuture\n\nAll\n\nNews\n\nAll\n\nEarth\n\nSolar System\n\nStars and Galaxies\n\nSubscribe to JPL News\n\nGalleries\n\nImages\n\nVideos\n\nAudio\n\nPodcasts\n\nApps\n\nVisions of the Future\n\nSlice of History\n\nRobotics at JPL\n\nEvents\n\nLecture Series\n\nTeam Competitions\n\nSpeakers Bureau\n\nCalendar\n\nVisit\n\nPublic Tours\n\nVirtual Tour\n\nDirections and Maps\n\nTopics\n\nJPL Life\n\nSolar System\n\nMars\n\nEarth\n\nClimate Change\n\nExoplanets\n\nStars and Galaxies\n\nRobotics\n\nMore\n\nAsteroid Watch\n\nNASA's Eyes Visualizations\n\nUniverse - Internal Newsletter\n\nSocial Media\n\nContact Us\n\nGet the Latest from JPL\n\nFollow Us\n\nJPL is a federally funded research and development center managed for NASA by\nCaltech.\n\nMore from JPL\n\nCareers Education Science & Technology Acquisition JPL Store\n\nCareers\n\nEducation\n\nScience & Technology\n\nAcquisition\n\nJPL Store\n\nRelated NASA Sites\n\nBasics of Spaceflight\n\nClimate Kids\n\nEarth / Global Climate Change\n\nExoplanet Exploration\n\nMars Exploration\n\nSolar System Exploration\n\nSpace Place\n\nNASA's Eyes Visualization Project\n\nVoyager Interstellar Mission\n\nNASA\n\nCaltech\n\nPrivacy\n\nImage Policy\n\nFAQ\n\nFeedback\n\nSite Managers: Veronica McGregor, Randal Jackson\n\nSite Editors: Tony Greicius, Naomi Hartono\n\nCL#: 21-0018\n\n", "frontpage": false}
