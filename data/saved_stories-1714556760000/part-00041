In fact, she said, she advises\nyoung lawyers not to pursue elite clerkship opportunities, because she thinks\nthe risks are too great.\n\n\"I don't think anything has changed,\" she said. \"I still have not received an\napology from the judiciary about what happened to me. I no longer expect one.\nI'm not holding my breath.\"\n\n### Above the law?\n\nMillions of people who experience harassment on the job enjoy workplace\nprotections, whether they report to private companies, nonprofit groups or\neven the U.S. Congress. But that's not the case for some 30,000 people who\nwork for the federal judiciary. That branch of government is largely exempt\nfrom the civil rights law that protects workers and job applicants from\ndiscrimination.\n\n\"I think the judiciary sees itself in a lot of ways as above the law,\" said\nGabe Roth, executive director of the watchdog group Fix the Court, a group\nthat advocates for more transparency and accountability in the federal court\nsystem. \"It sees itself as separate and different.\"\n\nJeremy Fogel, who served as a state and federal judge for 37 years, explained\nwhy judicial employees have been considered different.\n\n\"The history of that distinction is separation of powers and the concerns for\njudicial independence and worrying that Congress would over-regulate how the\njudiciary conducts its business,\" Fogel said.\n\nFogel, who now runs the Berkeley Judicial Institute, said he does not think\nCongress necessarily needs to act.\n\n\"But I think if you don't legislate something, then the judiciary has to be\nproactive,\" he added.\n\n### Office monitoring complaints hampered is by staffing\n\nIn 2017, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed a working group after #MeToo\nallegations emerged in the federal courts. He also created the Office of\nJudicial Integrity to monitor workplace issues and serve as a source for what\nhe called confidential guidance and counseling.\n\nToday, that office has just three employees. Its leader, Michael Henry, came\nfrom SafeSport, the nonprofit group formed to help reduce sexual abuse in\nOlympic sports programs but which has drawn controversy over its actions and\neffectiveness.\n\nPeter Kaplan, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,\ndeclined to identify the other employees at that office, except to say one is\nan \"administrative analyst,\" and defended the courts' response to #MeToo\ncomplaints.\n\n\"The Judiciary has long-standing, enforceable policies protecting its\nemployees against discrimination, harassment, and retaliation consistent with\nfederal employment discrimination statutes applicable in the executive and\nlegislative branches,\" Kaplan said in a written statement.\n\nThe judiciary publishes annual reports about complaints against judges.\nUsually those reports contain no names, just numbers. For the last few years,\nthe number of sexual harassment complaints has vacillated between zero and\nsix. It can take a long time for the court system to say what those judges\ndid, and to tell if any of the complaints has merit.\n\n\"Whatever disciplinary measures are happening, ethics training, being\ntemporarily taken off cases...it's almost impossible to find out\nbecause...it's very easy for the judiciary to bury it and the public to maybe\nnever even learn about it,\" said Roth, of Fix the Court.\n\n### 'A band-aid over a bullet hole'\n\nA rare glimpse into the process emerged last month, when the courts resolved a\ntwo-year-old complaint from a law clerk.\n\nAn unnamed federal judge agreed to receive counseling and watch training\nvideos after a clerk reported a hostile workplace environment. The clerk was\noffered the chance to transfer into another job. A subsequent investigation by\nthe judiciary uncovered concerns about the judge being \"overly harsh\" to other\nclerks, too.\n\nAliza Shatzman, who advocates for law clerks, said transferring to a new judge\nis not an option for some of them, for financial or logistical reasons.\n\n\"It's a band-aid over a bullet hole,\" she said. \"That's not solving the\nproblem.\"\n\nShatzman said the court system's typical practice, which does not identify\njudges involved the disciplinary process, could expose more unwitting young\nlawyers to more abuse.\n\nThe system for reporting problems can vary depending on where in the country a\njudge is based, a tangle of rules and procedures that can be hard even for\ntrained lawyers to navigate.\n\nShatzman told NPR she's heard of officials around the nation who are\ndesignated to receive complaints dissuading people from filing them, because\n\"not enough clerks\" are reporting abuse, or because the judge's behavior\n\"doesn't meet the standard for abusive conduct.\"\n\nGlenn Fine, who served as inspector general at the Justice Department and the\nPentagon, said the judiciary needs an independent watchdog, too.\n\n\"Self-policing is not working,\" Fine said. \"It is hard for judges and anyone\nto investigate their colleagues.\"\n\nThe toughest sanction against a federal judge is impeachment. But it's been 14\nyears since a judge was impeached and convicted for corruption and false\nstatements.\n\nMost discipline issues of the judiciary are handled by the judiciary. It's\ncommon for judges to resign while they're under investigation, which generally\nstops the probe, and allows them to collect retirement benefits.\n\nIn 2017, Alex Kozinski abruptly retired from the 9th circuit appeals court,\nafter more than 15 women accused him of sexual harassment. At the time,\nKozinski partially apologized for his behavior, noting he \"had a broad sense\nof humor and a candid way of speaking,\" but that it \"grieves me to learn that\nI caused any of my clerks to feel uncomfortable; this was never my intent.\"\n\nKozinski collected his pension and is now practicing as a lawyer in the same\ncourts he once dominated as a judge.\n\nWarren, who complained about a different 9th circuit judge, has shied away\nfrom even filing briefs in that court where she once clerked. She said she\ncontinues to hear harrowing stories from clerks all over the country, who are\ntoo afraid to report judges.\n\nThose judges enjoy lifetime tenure and operate with few limits on their power,\nwhile the young lawyers who clerk for them could be blocked from other job\nopportunities in the legal world after they air concerns. So a judge's word of\nrecommendation, or word of warning, carries enormous weight that extends\ndecades into a lawyer's career.\n\nSince her testimony, Warren said things have gotten worse because of what she\ncalls \"window dressing\" by the judiciary.\n\n### Congressional legislation stalled\n\nCongress has considered legislation, but failed to act so far, to make judges\nmore accountable. Lawmakers are awaiting the results of two reviews of the\njudiciary's workplace policies and actions due out this summer, including one\nfrom the Government Accountability Office.\n\nBut there are public hints the judiciary has been less than forthcoming with\nthose independent audits. A House Appropriations report for 2024 noted \"the\nCommittee expects the Judiciary and the Federal Judicial Center to provide\nregular and appropriate access to all necessary information requested by GAO\nand the National Academy of Public Administration so that their work can be\ncompleted in a timely manner.\"\n\nThe Administrative Office spokesman said in the statement that they are\n\"working cooperatively\" with the GAO.\n\nRep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., wrote the courts this month to express urgent\nconcern about how little public data is available about the judiciary's\nsystems to prevent abuse of employees.\n\n\"With no process, there is no due process; without strong systems in place to\nprotect the vulnerable, the Judiciary will fail in its duty to protect judges\nand employees in the workplace,\" Torres wrote.\n\nCongressional sources told NPR a new push for legislation could come later\nthis year.\n\nWere you harassed or bullied by a federal judge or do you know someone who\nwas?

That includes employees at private companies, nonprofit\ngroups and even the U.S. Congress. But that's not the case for some 30,000\npeople who work for the federal judiciary who have few safe ways to\nanonymously report abuse. NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports.\n\nCARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Four years ago, Olivia Warren made a choice that would\nchange her life. The Harvard Law School graduate testified before Congress\nabout harassment she suffered when she clerked for a federal appeals court\njudge.\n\nOLIVIA WARREN: I would do it again. I think that it came at enormous personal\ncost, and there are ongoing costs to my testimony. But in the story of my\nlife, it is something that I justify.\n\nJOHNSON: For 12 long minutes, she told House lawmakers about her experience\nworking for Stephen Reinhardt, a prominent judge in California who has since\ndied. He left a drawing of women's body parts at her desk, demeaned her\nappearance and questioned her husband's masculinity. Her testimony came during\nthe aftershocks of the #MeToo movement, which exposed mistreatment by powerful\nmen in corporate America, the entertainment industry and the media. Looking\nback now, Warren says she would not recommend others follow her path and speak\nout about abuse by federal judges. In fact, she says...\n\nWARREN: I'll also say that I advise people unequivocally not to clerk at all.\nAnd I do that because I think the risk is far too great.\n\nJOHNSON: Because the risks are too great. Those risks include being blocked\nfrom other job opportunities in the legal world and facing retaliation for\nmaking complaints against federal judges. Those judges enjoy lifetime tenure\nand operate with few limits on their power. For young lawyers, clerkships can\npave the way for lucrative jobs at law firms or universities. Again, Olivia\nWarren.\n\nWARREN: It remains a very strong marker of what your early success looked\nlike, and they are considered foundational markers of success in the legal\nprofession.\n\nJOHNSON: So a judge's word of recommendation or word of warning carries\nenormous weight. Gabe Roth is executive director of Fix the Court. His\nwatchdog group tries to increase accountability in the federal courts.\n\nGABE ROTH: I think the judiciary, in a lot of ways, sees itself as above the\nlaw. It sees itself as separate and different.\n\nJOHNSON: Roth says more than 900 federal judges are spread across the nation\nwith different ways of reporting discrimination, harassment or retaliation,\ndepending on the rules for a particular region of the country. But there's one\ncommon thread. The federal judiciary is exempt from Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act, the federal law that protects employees and job applicants from\ndiscrimination. Jeremy Fogel served as a state and federal judge for 37 years.\nHe explains why judicial employees have been considered different.\n\nJEREMY FOGEL: The history of that distinction is separation of powers and the\nconcerns for judicial independence and worrying that Congress would\noverregulate how the judiciary conducts its business.\n\nJOHNSON: Fogel, who now runs the Berkeley Judicial Institute, says he does not\nthink Congress necessarily needs to act.\n\nFOGEL: But I think if you don't legislate something, then the judiciary has to\nbe proactive.\n\nJOHNSON: Fogel says sexual abuse in the judiciary is not pervasive. More\ncommon, he says, is bullying and making unreasonable demands. He also credits\nthe courts for the steps they've taken to date to make things better for\nclerks and other workers. The code of conduct policy for federal judges says\nthey should not engage in or tolerate harassment or abusive behavior. In 2017,\nChief Justice John Roberts appointed a working group after #MeToo allegations\nemerged in the federal courts. He also created the Office of Judicial\nIntegrity to monitor workplace issues and serve as a source for what he called\nconfidential guidance and counseling. Today, that office has just three\nemployees. The judiciary also publishes annual reports about complaints\nagainst judges, usually no names, just numbers. Gabe Roth monitors them for\nFix the Court. When it comes to sexual harassment, Roth says...\n\nROTH: Yeah, we're talking about somewhere between zero and six formal\ncomplaints against judges a year. That is not a lot. That seems to be on the\nlow end of what's actually happening.\n\nJOHNSON: Then he waits for courts to say what those judges did to tell if any\nof the complaints has merit.\n\nROTH: Whatever disciplinary measures are happening - ethics training, being\ntemporarily taken off cases - it's almost impossible to find out because it is\nvery easy for the judiciary to bury it and for the public to maybe never even\nlearn about it.\n\nJOHNSON: A rare glimpse into the process emerged last month when the courts\nresolved a two-year-old complaint from a law clerk. An unnamed federal judge\nagreed to receive counseling and watch training videos after a clerk reported\na hostile workplace environment. The clerk was offered the chance to transfer\ninto another job. Later, an investigation by the judiciary uncovered concerns\nabout the judge being overly harsh to other clerks, too. Glenn Fine served as\ninspector general, an independent watchdog at the Justice Department and the\nPentagon. He says the judiciary needs a watchdog, too.\n\nGLENN FINE: Self-policing is not working. It is hard for judges and anyone to\ninvestigate their colleagues.\n\nJOHNSON: The toughest sanction against a federal judge is impeachment. But\nit's been 14 years since a judge was impeached and convicted for corruption\nand false statements. Most discipline issues of the judiciary are handled by\nthe judiciary. And it's common for judges to resign while they're under\ninvestigation, which generally stops the probe and allows them to collect\nretirement benefits. In 2017, Alex Kozinski abruptly retired from the Ninth\nCircuit Appeals Court after more than 15 women accused him of sexual\nharassment. Kozinski collected his pension. He's now practicing as a lawyer in\nthe same courts he once dominated as a judge.\n\nWARREN: I don't think that anything has changed.\n\nJOHNSON: Olivia Warren, who complained about a different Ninth Circuit judge,\nhas shied away from even filing briefs in that court where she once clerked.\nWarren says she continues to hear harrowing stories from clerks all over the\nU.S. who are too afraid to report judges. Since her testimony, she thinks\nthings have gotten worse because of what she calls window dressing by the\njudiciary.\n\nWARREN: I still have not received an apology from the judiciary about what\nhappened to me. I don't expect one. I'm no longer holding my breath.\n\nJOHNSON: Congress has considered legislation but failed to act so far to make\njudges more accountable. Congressional sources told NPR a new push for\nlegislation is likely to come later this year.\n\nCarrie Johnson, NPR News, Washington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THRUPENCE'S \"FOLDS\")\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
