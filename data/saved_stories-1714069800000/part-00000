While he does not cite, it\u2019s\nlikely he was influenced by Carl Shapiro & Google economist Hal Varian\u2019s best-\nselling 1999 technology economics book, Information Rules: A Strategic Guide\nto the Network Economy, which discusses the idea extensively. Definition: make\nyourself a monopoly by growing the markets around you. I excerpt the\ndefinition & examples below (emphasis in original, most links added):\n\n> Every product in the marketplace has substitutes and complements. A\n> substitute is another product you might buy if the first product is too\n> expensive. Chicken is a substitute for beef. If you\u2019re a chicken farmer and\n> the price of beef goes up, the people will want more chicken, and you will\n> sell more.\n>\n> A complement is a product that you usually buy together with another\n> product. Gas and cars are complements. Computer hardware is a classic\n> complement of computer operating systems. And babysitters are a complement\n> of dinner at fine restaurants. In a small town, when the local five star\n> restaurant has a two-for-one Valentine\u2019s day special, the local babysitters\n> double their rates. (Actually, the nine-year-olds get roped into early\n> service.)\n>\n> All else being equal, demand for a product increases when the prices of its\n> complements decrease.\n>\n> ...In general, a company\u2019s strategic interest is going to be to get the\n> price of their complements as low as possible. The lowest theoretically\n> sustainable price would be the \u201ccommodity price\u201d\u2014the price that arises when\n> you have a bunch of competitors offering indistinguishable goods. So:\n>\n> Smart companies try to commoditize their products\u2019 complements.\n>\n> If you can do this, demand for your product will increase and you will be\n> able to charge more and make more.\n>\n> When IBM designed the PC architecture, they used off-the-shelf parts instead\n> of custom parts, and they carefully documented the interfaces between the\n> parts in the (revolutionary) IBM-PC Technical Reference Manual^2. Why? So\n> that other manufacturers could join the party. As long as you match the\n> interface, you can be used in PCs. IBM\u2019s goal was to commoditize the add-in\n> market, which is a complement of the PC market, and they did this quite\n> successfully. Within a short time scrillions of companies sprung up offering\n> memory cards, hard drives, graphics cards, printers, etc. Cheap add-ins\n> meant more demand for PCs.\n>\n> When IBM licensed the operating system PC-DOS from Microsoft, Microsoft was\n> very careful not to sell an exclusive license. This made it possible for\n> Microsoft to license the same thing to Compaq and the other hundreds of OEMs\n> who had legally cloned the IBM PC using IBM\u2019s own documentation. Microsoft\u2019s\n> goal was to commoditize the PC market. Very soon the PC itself was basically\n> a commodity, with ever decreasing prices, consistently increasing power, and\n> fierce margins that make it extremely hard to make a profit. The low prices,\n> of course, increase demand. Increased demand for PCs meant increased demand\n> for their complement, MS-DOS. All else being equal, the greater the demand\n> for a product, the more money it makes for you.

Raymond\u2019s famous 1999 The Cathedral and the Bazaar, he includes a\nsection, \u201cOpen Source as a Strategic Weapon\u201d on commercial motivations for\nsponsorship of FLOSS along the lines of Spolsky\u2019s examples, listing Apache,\nthe X window system, and Netscape Mozilla as examples of strategic uses of\nFLOSS which look like \u201ccommoditize your complement\u201d examples:\n\n> Cost-sharing as a competitive weapon\n>\n> Earlier, we considered Apache as an example of better and cheaper\n> infrastructure development through cost-sharing in an open-source project.\n> For software and systems vendors competing against Microsoft and its IIS web\n> server, the Apache project is also a competitive weapon. It would be\n> difficult, perhaps impossible, for any other single web server vendor to\n> completely offset the advantages of Microsoft\u2019s huge war chest and desktop-\n> monopoly market power. But Apache enables each corporate participant in the\n> project to offer a webserver that is both technically superior to IIS and\n> reassures customers with a majority market share\u2014at far lower cost. This\n> improves the market position and cost of production for value-added\n> electronic-commerce products (like IBM\u2019s WebSphere).\n>\n> ...Resetting the competition\n>\n> When the development of the open-source X Window System was funded by DEC in\n> the 1980s, their explicit goal was to \u201creset the competition\u201d. At the time\n> there were several competing alternative graphics environments for Unix in\n> play, notably including Sun Microsystems\u2019s NeWS system. DEC strategists\n> believed (probably correctly) that if Sun were able to establish a\n> proprietary graphics standard it would get a lock on the booming Unix-\n> workstation market. By funding X and lending it engineers, and by allying\n> with many smaller vendors to establish X as a de-facto standard, DEC was\n> able to neutralize advantages held by Sun and other competitors with more\n> in-house expertise in graphics. This moved the focus of competition in the\n> workstation market towards hardware, where DEC was historically strong.\n>\n> Preventing a choke hold\n>\n> In explaining the loss-leader/market-positioner business model above, I\n> described how Netscape\u2019s open-sourcing of the Mozilla browser was a\n> (successful) maneuver aimed at preventing Microsoft from effectively locking\n> up HTML markup and the HTTP protocol.\n\n# Generalizing\n\nA way I would express it as: Any product is the joint outcome of a large\nnumber of individual components, each of which layers is necessary but not\nsufficient to the final valuable use of the entire stack put together; a\nsmartphone is not much good without a power-efficient sensitive radio, but the\nradio is not much good without a good OS on top of it, and a good OS is not\nmuch good either without great apps like web browsers (and is a web browser\nall that useful if there aren\u2019t useful websites to use in it, and where are\nthe languages & compilers for all this coming from anyway...?). Many products\nare formed by a stack of two-sided markets.\n\nThe end product of a Symbian, iOS, or Android smartphone is without a doubt\nfantastically valuable to the user, but what is the fair division of the\nrevenue among the countless people, technologies, manufacturers who created\neach of the many critically-important layers in the full tech stack? Certainly\ncontemporary intellectual property law (eg. \u201csoftware patents\u201d) does not\nprovide a socially-efficient distribution like the Shapley value to all the\nparticipants! There are constraints in that the final product cannot cost more\nthan the value to the user (otherwise consumers simply wouldn\u2019t buy it, and if\nthe consumer surplus isn\u2019t at least considerably above zero, no one would\nbother to learn about it) and the companies in the commoditized layers can\u2019t\nbe forced down to below marginal costs (otherwise they would go bankrupt &\nexit the market), but these are weak, and do not give any good hints as to who\nwill capture the majority of the value: the chip fab manufacturers? the chip\ndesigners? the device manufacturers? the OS developers? the userland\napplication developers? the ISPs? the website owners?\n\nVertical integration can be an effective way of resolving the intractable\nmarket dispute with top-down dictatorships, but can require lax anti-monopoly\nregulations, high capital investment, massive corporation overextension &\nempire-building, and risks being outcompeted at every level by nimbler\ncompetitors; this makes it difficult for any up-and-coming company to\nimplement, and often ineffective. But there is often a cheaper, easier way to\nbuy insurance and achieve the same goals. Commoditizing the complements, in\ncontrast, permits a company to remain (relatively) small & lean, can often be\naccomplished with small strategic investments in releasing intellectual\nproperty or other investments, can be done incrementally focusing on specific\nlayers without the \u201cBig Bang\u201d orientation of vertical integration and\npermitting \u201cdefeat in detail\u201d, retains the general facade of competition, and\nensures the extreme competition remains confined to other layers of the stack\nwhere the product can benefit from the cost reductions in the complement but\nis not itself at any risk.\n\nIn practice, the division winds up being due to power plays and market\ndynamics, and who can most effectively erect a moat while sabotaging\ncompetitors, exploiting tactics like lawsuits & software patent trolling,\nproprietary APIs, cross-business subsidies, kickbacks, DRM, deliberate\nincompatibility or \u201cembrace and extend\u201d, FUD, operating at a loss\nindefinitely, etc. (\u201cThere\u2019s An App For That\u201d is why you buy an iPhone\u2014but\nit\u2019s Apple with the $930 billion market cap & not the app developers.)\n\nThe ideal implementation resembles an arms dealer selling to all sides: the\nmore customers, the better. (An arms dealer with only one customer is a sad\narms dealer; two is bad because they can still cooperate, and so three is much\nbetter.)\n\nDone correctly, this is effective at perpetuating incumbents\u2019 long-term\ncontrol of markets & justifies their enormous valuations\u2014by definition, the\ncompetitors elsewhere in the stack, who might develop a chokepoint, are too\nnumerous, fragmented, and low-margin to invest substantially into threatening\nR&D^4 or long-term strategic initiatives, and any upstart startups can be\nrelatively easily bought out or suppressed (eg. Instagram or WhatsApp). Nor\ndoes this require convoluted explanations like \u201cthey are pretending to not be\nmonopolists\u201d or fully general unfalsifiable claims like \u201cit\u2019s good PR\u201d for why\nbig companies like Google steadily fund so many apparently oddball projects\nlike new foreign language fonts (or free TrueType fonts & TrueType itself) or\nopen source TCP/IP protocol replacements, which are neither directly\nprofitable nor well-known nor impressively charitable\u2014but do have clear\nexplanations in terms of business objectives like \u201cdriving more mobile web\nbrowsing\u201d (thus allowing Google to show them more ads, because the complement,\nmobile web browsing, has become cheaper/easier). I wonder if this also\nexplains some of the striking copycat behavior we see sometimes\u2014as entities\nget worried something might be a commodifier, either because it is crucial but\nwas formerly considered \u2018neutral\u2019 or because they assume the other entity\nknows something they don\u2019t. (Google cared little about an also-ran code-\nhosting site like GitLab other than some VC investment\u2014well, right up until\nMicrosoft outbid it for Github & Github became free for individual developers\n& acquired NPM, and then suddenly GitLab becomes a unicorn with even more VC\nfrom Google & others.) As ucaetano puts it:\n\n> Another way that I like to express that is \u201ccreate a desert of profitability\n> around you\u201d. I once had a strategy professor define the Google business\n> model somewhat like that, where \u201cGoogle tries to make every other business\n> around it free or irrelevant\u201d...A desert of profitability shifts consumers\n> to you, and keeps competitors away.\n\n# Examples\n\nA list of examples I think reflect this dynamic to some extent:\n\n  * hardware vs software: IBM\u2019s1956 consent decree settling a 1952 antitrust lawsuit: IBM was required to sell as well as lease its devices; more importantly, its business services arm was spun off and IBM had to license software/patents/manuals/training to competitors.\n\nPreviously, IBM (like many other hardware manufacturers) included all\nnecessary software with its hardware for \u2018free\u2019, particularly for the OS/360,\nstrangling any independent software market; the decree and the eventual\n\u201cunbundling\u201d is credited with sparking a vibrant (and highly profitable)\nmarket for IBM mainframe software. (It is also credited with putting the fear\nof God into IBM & protecting smaller companies like Microsoft; in an ironic\nrepetition, Microsoft\u2019s own antitrust travails in the 1990s are credited for\ncausing it to back off its classic ruthless tactics and enable Google\u2019s own\nrise to dominance^5.)\n\nIBM\u2019s patent-free release of the PowerPC ISA in 2019 might be another example.\n\n  * banks vs merchants: credit card companies/small businesses: interchange fees in particular (part of why the credit card industry is one of the highest-profit margin ones after academic publishing\u2014itself a highly suspicious example). Amazon vs PayPal is a big example.\n\n  * integrated vs open architectures: Lisp machines vs x86/SPARC/Sun\n\n  * apps vs OSes: Netscape vs Windows (in Robert Metcalfe\u2019s infamous expression, cross-platform web browsers & the Internet would reduce Windows to a \u201cpoorly debugged set of device drivers\u201d); MS\u2019s initial response was to... license IE free for all users, not just noncommercial users like Netscape, killing a major revenue stream for Netscape early on^6\n\n  * FLOSS: Red Hat, Google etc\n\n    * editors vs IDEs: XEmacs represented an early example of a company trying to improve a FLOSS version of a genre of software previously typically sold commercially (text editors) in order to support sales of more niche tooling (their C++ IDE)\n\n    * IDEs vs software devs: GNU and compiler/interpreter companies: GCC; commercial C++ implementations would themselves be cannibalized by GCC, and IDEs by other FLOSS IDEs (apropos of IBM and Java, Eclipse; Microsoft, Visual Studio Code & dev tools in general)\n\n    * programming language ecosystems vs users: in programming communities (especially functional languages like Haskell/OCaml/Scala/Clojure), it is common for a lot of work on compilers/libraries/tutorials/books to be sponsored by web development or consultancies, serving both as advertisements for their capabilities and also removing pain points to use of said programming languages and thus increasing demand for their services. (If nobody uses Haskell because GHC has a major bug, nobody is going to hire a Haskell consultancy like Well-Typed, either. In the sales funnel, you have to have customers entering the funnel to get any customers out.)\n\n    * art tools vs artists: media design tools like Autodesk\u2019s AutoCAD/Maya vs FLOSS alternatives like Blender, the latter of which are supported by commercial users such as the animation studio Khara feeling the pain of licensing, or Facebook aiming at bigger things (its Metaverse). Other examples include Netflix sponsoring development of 4k HDR anime (which would be highly-bandwidth-intensive to stream)\n\n  * TTRPG game publishers vs themselves\u2019 \u201copen gaming\u201d:\n\nIn 2000, Wizards of the Coast (owner of Dungeons & Dragons) executive Ryan\nDancey masterminded the creation of the Open Game License (OGL), modeled on\nthe GPL, and the release of the 3rd Edition\u2019s core d20 System rules under the\nOGL 1.0; Dancey\u2019s reasoning was explicitly based on the idea that by quasi-\nopen-sourcing D&D, that would help it prevail over the constant stream of\ntabletop RPG competitors through network effects, and drive sales of the\n(expensive) core rulebook, the Player\u2019s Handbook. The system was rapidly\nadopted by other companies (Lecocq & Demil2006). This bet appears to have paid\noff: it is difficult to imagine the 2010s D&D renaissance (including Hollywood\nmovies & TV series!), particularly driven by Kickstarter, without the open-\nsourcing.\n\nAnd illustrating the economic contingency of \u2018commoditize-your-complement\u2019\ndynamics, it is equally difficult to imagine Wizards of the Coast slaughtering\nthe golden goose in November 2022 by launching the OGL 1.1 without such a\nrenaissance. (A coalition of D&D publishers, led by Paizo, announced a\ncounter-license and their willingness to both abandon the original D&D content\nand defend the OGL 1.0 in court, forcing Wizards of the Coast to back down\u2014for\nnow. But one can understand why one of the most notable elements of the\nrenaissance, Critical Role, would decide to use their own publisher & promote\ntheir own D&D, Daggerheart starting April 2023.)\n\n  * game portals vs game devs: Valve: Steam vs game developers/studios such as Epic Games^7\n\nSteam can be seen as a \u2018console maker\u2019 which focused on software before\ninvesting in Steam Boxes/Decks (and then libraries & game engines to run on\nit), and exemplifying console makers vs game devs: the success of Epic Games\u2019s\nFortnite is attributed in part to its use of the cross-platform Unreal game\nengine^8, allowing it to run seamlessly on all major PC, mobile, and consoles\n(\u201cMicrosoft Windows, macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS,\nAndroid\u201d); when Sony tried to maintain the usual PlayStation 4 walled-garden\nby breaking interoperability with Fortnite players on other platforms, the\nbacklash forced it to announce it would compromise, and Epic Games simply\nopted out of Android\u2019s walled garden & Google\u2019s cut of revenue, saving Epic\nGames more than $50 million annually.\n\n    * apps vs OSes: Linux (\u201cSteamOS\u201d) vs Microsoft Windows (\u201cGabe I think saw it as a stick to beat Microsoft with\u2014and he was absolutely correct, it worked.\u201d; \u201c...I was partially motivated to give the game industry a backup in case Microsoft execs decided to clamp down. They visited Valve and threatened to do this by squeezing Steam out.\u201d)\n\n    * games vs game hardware: VR: Valve\u2019s Vive vs Facebook Oculus.\n\nValve will be fine if Vive doesn\u2019t win the VR market as long as no one else\nwins too\u2014because no one makes money on computer games except... Steam. While\nfor Oculus, the danger is in becoming just an expensive hardware peripheral,\nwhose parts they don\u2019t manufacture but merely assemble against a standard\nsoftware interface, where they are forced to compete against cut-rate Chinese\nmanufacturing giants for near-zero profit margin, a rerun of the smartphone\nmarket (a similar market, as they even use the same screens). The danger of\nlockin to an Oculus/Facebook walled garden is clear to gamers, and has made\nlife difficult for Oculus: they can\u2019t push exclusives too hard or be as\naggressive in fighting outsiders as they want, lest they spark a backlash or\ncripple the VR market as a whole. Which makes it interesting\u2014both Vive and\nOculus have incentives to cooperate... for now. But there\u2019s constant pressure\nfor a betrayal when a player gets desperate or decides the market has matured\nand it\u2019s time to break for the finish line, like Microsoft releasing IE.\n\n    * publishers vs esports teams: game publishers, due to DRM & forcing matches to go through publishers, have a death-grip over their platforms, and publishers like Riot Games or Blizzard Entertainment have been careful to maintain control over their esports lest the tail wag the dog, weakening teams by downplaying team merchandise & regularly adding in IP requirements & taking revenue cuts upfront\n\n  * telecoms vs users: ISPS vs tech companies via Net neutrality (eg. spectrum auctions, Google Fiber, zero-rating)\n\neg. Jio Reliance, an Indian telecom ISP, disrupted the Indian mobile Internet\nmarket by cannibalizing existing margins, under the logic that after\ncommoditizing data & voice, it\u2019ll profit (China/Africa-style) off broadband &\n\u201ccontent, financial services and advertising\u201d^9\n\n  * networking hardware manufacturers vs Internet companies: special-purpose networking hardware (especially Cisco Systems) vs Software-defined networking (as employed by Google/Microsoft/Amazon/cloud giants)\n\nPeople are always surprised how much custom silicon goes into a datacenter\nserver or a smartphone (it\u2019s computers all the way down), but a company like\nApple or Amazon cannot risk being held up by a would-be monopolist like Intel,\nthus the perennial interest in fabbing their own custom chips or dabbling in\nchips from Intel rivals ARM & AMD\u2014cutting-edge CPUs, however, remain hard and\nexpensive enough to design & make that no one has yet succeeded in\ncommoditizing top-end x86 CPUs, and these moves remain largely negotiating\nploys or improvements for niche use-cases\n\n    * RISC-V vs x86/ARM: pretty much the only reason the tech industry funds RISC-V or takes on burdens like porting Android is to keep the incumbents on their toes lest they begin exploring monopoly pricing\n\n    * Machine Learning: Nvidia\u2019s GPUs/CUDA vs AMD/OpenCL vs Google TensorFlow/TPUs (exposed to end-users as Kaggle & Google Colab)\n\n      * ML datasets/models: Companies like Google or Facebook or Nvidia^10, which sell advertising^11 (wrapped around services enhanced by AI) or hardware, release remarkable amounts of large high-quality datasets & trained models & source code (eg. Facebook\u2019s PyTorch or LLaMA family of models). Companies which are selling model use directly, such as OpenAI\u2019s commercial subsidiary focused on GPT-3, tend to release less & release indirectly-related products^12\n\nNon-release occasionally prompts commoditization efforts: CoreWeave, a cloud\nGPU provider, was an early funder of EleutherAI\u2019s efforts to replicate GPT-3;\nanother GPT-3 replication effort, BigScience, is funded by Hugging Face. (See\nalso \u201cgreen AI\u201d, \u201cAI ethics\u201d; cui bono?) Even Apple\u2014the most secretive &\nuncooperative of all big tech companies\u2014finds it in its interest to release\ndatasets like Hypersim.\n\n  * smartphones (lots):\n\n    * OS vs Manufacturers: Windows Mobile/Android/iOS vs smartphone manufacturers\n\n    * OS vs apps: iOS/apps: to put it bluntly, \u201cApple Doesn\u2019t Want Your iPhone App to Make Money\u201d and if your app does anyway, it\u2019ll take a 30% cut. Note for example: the incompatibility of video call apps across platforms, or the fight between Samsung Bixby/Google Assistant & services\n\n      * Google Maps^13 vs OpenStreetMap (OSM) vs Mapillary: the dominance of Google Maps has led to dissatisfaction with its steep price increases and limits, Apple replaced Google Maps on iPhones with Apple Maps in 2012 despite serious quality problems (similar moves were made by FourSquare & Craigslist), and rivals like Yahoo!/Microsoft/Facebook/DigitalGlobe/Telenav/Lyft have supported OSM as a counterweight and many corporations actively contribute to OSM improvements (eg. FB deep learning efforts). Facebook outright bought Mapillary in June 2020, apparently to... release their data for free commercial use. All this proved inadequate, so in 2022, \u201cOverture Maps\u201d was created by the Linux Foundation + Microsoft + Amazon + Facebook + TomTom.\n\n    * Designer vs Manufacturers: Qualcomm vs Apple with Intel as wedge\n\n    * Designer vs Telecoms: iPhone vs telecom ISPs: demand for the iPhone was so enormous it was used as a wedge to force cellphone networks into allowing things they didn\u2019t want\u2014such as letting a large fraction of all smartphones on their network out of their control and extracting unusual concessions\n\n  * genome sequencer manufacturers vs doctors/researchers: Illumina vs 23andMe & BGI:\n\nThe Illuminati have a notorious stranglehold on the genome sequencing market,\nwith enough of an Intel-style lead in consumables efficiency that they can\ndrop prices just enough to suppress competitors (this is may what is behind\nthe occasional inexplicable \u201cpauses\u201d in the famous graph of genome sequencing\ncost dropping exponentially over time); in response to the high prices, heavy\nusers of genome sequencing have launched desperate attempts to escape the\nIllumina monopoly, such as BGI\u2019s ill-fated acquisition of Complete Genomics\nwhose sequencers ultimately proved inadequate after sowing internal chaos &\nwrecking many projects; rumor has it that 23andMe launched its own very\nexpensive internal attempt to develop replacement genome sequencers, and this\nwas a major contributor to its financial woes after the FDA debacle.\n\n  * ride-sharing service vs drivers: Uber/Lyft vs self-employed drivers vs self-driving cars\n\n    * Car Software Devs vs Car Manufacturers: self-driving car developers like Google Waymo vs car manufacturers like Honda (the Honda-Waymo partnership fell apart in 2018 reportedly because Honda wanted access to the AI & software of Waymo, and Waymo, for reasons that should be clear now, refused; Honda was forced to invest in rival GM\u2019s Cruise). As the WSJ describes automakers\u2019 thinking:\n\n> The global auto industry thinks it sees the future, and it will require a\n> transformation without precedent in business history: The giant industrial\n> sector has to turn itself into a nimble provider of software and\n> services...Auto executives say they need to avoid a nightmare tech scenario\n> that\u2019s become a common refrain at industry gatherings. They don\u2019t want to\n> become the next \u201chandset makers\u201d\u2014commodity suppliers of hardware, helplessly\n> watching all the profits flow to software makers like Apple Inc and Alphabet\n> Inc, the parent of Google. Both companies are investing in software for\n> driverless cars.\n\n  * voice synthesizers vs singers: Crypton\u2019s Vocaloid vs singers: the voice-synthesizer software sparked an amateur explosion of song production, as apparently even finicky software made high-quality singing far more accessible; Crypton sells the software and maintains control over specific characters like Hatsune Miku (sampled from minor voice actress Saki Fujita), particularly over all licensing and commercial revenue, which formerly would have to be shared with the human idol.\n\nNote the segmentation\u2014software like Vocaloid synthesizers empower the\nmusicians (who can now produce high-quality, competitive with humans given\nenough tweaking, vocals to go along with their music) at the expense of the\nmore-specialized singers. (A singer can produce their own version of a\nVocaloid hit, but are no longer a chokepoint.)\n\n    * An emerging variant of this is the Virtual YouTuber genre.\n\n  * Internet services vs manufacturers: FB\u2019s Open Compute Project providing free designs like Open Rack for building efficient datacenters, and acquisitions of Instagram/WhatsApp\n\n    * FLOSS vs SaaS: Elastic vs Amazon/Netflix/Expedia: Elasticsearch is text-search software for large-scale document searches; it is commercialized by Elastic, which follows a split-FLOSS model where the core Elasticsearch is FLOSS but features critical for large-scale commercial use (like \u2018any security\u2019) are closed-source & must be licensed. In response to Elastic de-emphasizing the FLOSS and increasingly switching development to \u201csource-available\u201d/closed-source-only, on 2019-03-11, Amazon/Netflix/Expedia\u2014who offer Elasticsearch as part of their cloud offerings or rely on it internally\u2014announced a fork, \u201cOpen Distro for Elasticsearch\u201d; Elastic has further modified its licensing in response, and Amazon forked back harder. So it goes... Conversely, consider Amazon AWS (eg. Finch) vs Kubernetes/Docker. (As one of the main cloud providers, Amazon is merely one the most visible & criticized practitioners of this kind of enclosure, but, rhetoric about \u2018strip-mining\u2019 aside, of course this sort of thing is why much FLOSS software is funded in the first place by entities large and small & those complaining often benefit enormously from commoditize-your-complement fights elsewhere\u2014what OSes do they all run on, for example?)\n\n  * image hosts vs social media services: Imgur vs Reddit: \u201cThe Decline of Imgur on Reddit and the Rise of Reddit\u2019s Native Image Hosting\u201d\n\n  * media companies vs the Internet: Vevo vs YouTube (\u201ca former YouTube exec\u201d is quoted as saying \u201cHuge huge success for YouTube...YouTube needed Vevo to exist for just long enough to become so popular that the labels had no leverage anymore.\u201d) , Hulu vs Netflix/Amazon/BitTorrent...\n\n  * search engines vs market operators:\n\n    * Darknet Markets: many DNMs provided an API for the DNM search engine \u201cGrams\u201d when small^14, then neglected or revoked it at some point; this has an easy interpretation: DNM sellers and buyers want markets to be commodities that they can smoothly move their reputations & business between as DNMs go up or down (as they historically have); while of course, markets want vendors to be trapped and locked into them, and the market able to charge high commissions for the privilege of being where buyers go to find drugs\n\n    * Booking Agencies vs Hotels/Airlines: exemplified by the story of Room Key and Booking.com\n\n      * more recently, they are now all pitted against search engines as that is where customers start\n\n  * Restaurants:\n\n    * Restaurants vs Reservation Booking Companies: eg. OpenTable/SevenRooms\n\n    * Restaurants vs Food Order Apps: Internet/mobile app companies like Seamless/Grubhub/Uber Eats/DoorDash aggregate customers for ordering food locally, but of course, they take a large slice of revenue in an industry with already razor-thin, driving restaurants to smaller more-specialized competitors like Slice\n\n  * Venture Capital: Y Combinator: running Hacker News, releasing \u201cSAFE\u201d notes & sales templates, developing Startup School\n\n# See Also\n\n  * Tragedy of the anticommons\n\n  * Exit, Voice, and Loyalty\n\n  * Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future\n\n  * \u201cTech Holy Wars are Coordination Problems\u201d\n\n# External Links\n\n  * Many historical examples can be seen in Jimmy Maher\u2019s PC gaming history \u201cThe Digital Antiquarian\u201d:\n\n    * eg. the creation of & struggle over the IBM PC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n  * \u201cBetter Than Free\u201d, Kevin Kelly\n\n  * Steve Yegge\u2019s Google Platforms Rant\n\n  * \u201cDigital Sharecropping\u201d\n\n  * \u201cThe Wheel of Reincarnation\u201d in computer displays\n\n  * \u201cIn the Beginning was the Command Line\u201d, Neal Stephenson\n\n  * \u201cAggregation Theory\u201d, Ben Thompson\n\n  * \u201c\u2018Crowds\u2019 of Amateurs & Professional Entrepreneurs in Marketplaces\u201d, Boudreau2019\n\n  * FLOSS:\n\n    * \u201cThe Grand Unified Theory On The Economics Of Free\u201d\n\n    * \u201cThe Internet Was Built on the Free Labor of Open Source Developers.

It was republished in the 2004 anthology, Joel on Software: And on Diverse and Occasionally Related Matters That Will Prove of Interest to Software Developers, Designers, and Managers, and to Those Who, Whether by Good Fortune or Ill Luck, Work with Them in Some Capacity, but I only spotted minor formatting changes like removing some hyperlinks, so the 2002 blog post is the canonical version.\n\n  2. To quote David J. Bradley, who worked on the IBM PC team, \u201cWe had learned from the DataMaster development and from the experiences of others that even a company the size of IBM couldn\u2019t develop all the hardware and software to make a personal computer a success. From the beginning, we decided to publish data concerning all the hardware and software interfaces. Anyone designing an adapter or a program to run on the IBM PC would get as much information as we had available.\u201d The success of this strategy and the (unpatented, royalty-free) Industry Standard Architecture prompted IBM\u2019s (failed) attempt to put the cat back in the bag with its Micro Channel architecture; as Maher describes it:\n\n> Unlike the original IBM bus architecture, MCA was locked up inside an\n> ironclad cage of patents, making it legally uncloneable unless one could\n> somehow negotiate a license to do so through IBM. The patents even extended\n> to add-on cards and other peripherals that might be compatible with MCA,\n> meaning that absolutely anyone who wanted to make a hardware add-on for an\n> MCA machine would have to negotiate a license and pay for the privilege. The\n> result should be not only a lucrative new revenue stream but also complete\n> control of business computing\u2019s further evolution. Yes, the clonesters would\n> be able to survive for a few more years making machines using the older\n> 16-bit bus architecture. In the longer term, however, as personal computing\n> inevitably transitioned into a realm of 32 bits, they would survive purely\n> at IBM\u2019s whim, their fate predicated on IBM\u2019s willingness to grant them a\n> patent license for MCA and their own willingness to pay dearly for it.\n\n  3. Sun didn\u2019t find a place, and the remains of Sun Microsystems were ultimately purchased by Oracle in 2009 \u2013Editor.\n\n  4. Of course, this can pose a problem of its own: if the other layers of the stack have near-zero profits, how will they afford to develop new technology that the incumbent might desire? Apple, for example, apparently has to extend large loans and provide other life-support for hardware makers to get the new materials & manufacturing techniques it wants. This does not always end well, like in the case of the ultra-hard sapphire screens for the iPhone (TechCrunch; WSJ).\n\n  5. \u201cThe Case Against Google: Critics say the search giant is squelching competition before it begins. Should the government step in?\u201d\n\n> Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish\n> anything\u2014that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers,\n> that humbled Microsoft\u2014didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback\n> said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on\n> Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why\n> Google exists today, he said.\n>\n> Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early\n> 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking\n> Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the\n> salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally\n> different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious\n> and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of\n> terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court\n> decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former\n> Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the\n> newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer.\n> \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the\n> regulators anymore.\u201d\n>\n> In public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft,\n> executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials\u2014the\n> kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored\u2014be invited to every\n> meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and\n> describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if\n> anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior\n> executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official\n> could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer\n> detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point\n> his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor. In the early 2000s,\n> Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be\n> proactively shared with competitors\u2014literally describing what the company\n> intended to create before software was even built\u2014to make sure it wouldn\u2019t\n> offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged.\n> But they went along with it. And most important, as Microsoft lived under\n> government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal\n> discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor\u2014Google. There had\n> been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the\n> popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they\n> would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or,\n> perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data\n> in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201d\n>\n> Microsoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine\n> could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut\n> there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble\n> again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled\n> Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one\n> reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly. \u201cIf\n> Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d\n> Reback told me.\n\n  6. \u201c\u2018Crush Them\u2019: An Oral History of the Lawsuit That Upended Silicon Valley\u201d:\n\n> Jon Mittelhauser (NCSA Mosaic co-author/Netscape co-founder): \u201cThe actual\n> license for the Netscape browser was free for noncommercial use, but\n> commercial companies had to pay. ... We were actually bringing in a fair\n> amount of browser revenue. Microsoft came along and just gave away the\n> browser for free, for any use, for commercial use, noncommercial use,\n> whatever. That undercut that whole business.\u201d\n>\n> Harry First (antitrust bureau chief, New York Attorney General\u2019s Office):\n> \u201cIt wasn\u2019t being free that was a bad thing. It was the end result of that\n> being that Internet Explorer would be the exclusive browser and that no\n> other competitor would arise as a competing operating system. ... It was\n> basically exclusionary behavior. It was an effort to smother Netscape in the\n> cradle and cut off its air supply.\u201d\n>\n> Gary Reback (antitrust lawyer representing Netscape): \u201cWhat Microsoft was\n> doing was not just damaging to a company-namely Netscape-but it was damaging\n> to a whole new generation of technology.\u201d\n>\n> ...Mittelhauser: \u201cWhat both Microsoft and Netscape missed out on was that\n> realization that the browser didn\u2019t really matter. It was sites that\n> mattered. We easily could have bought Yahoo, Google, etc. But the Google\n> guys and the Yahoo guys basically worked with us and we helped get them set\n> up.\u201d\n>\n> Stephen Houck (antitrust bureau chief, New York Attorney General\u2019s Office):\n> \u201cSome people say the decree caused Microsoft to lose its edge. I\u2019m not\n> really convinced that was the case. I think what it did do is make them very\n> careful about using market power they had in Windows to affect related areas\n> of software like the browser or search or operating systems for handheld\n> devices.\u201d\n>\n> Steve Lohr (technology and economics reporter, The New York Times): \u201cIt\n> helped provide an opening for Google, for sure. I remember doing this story\n> when Google was upset because Microsoft was trying to hide the Google Search\n> box. And then they fell away from that, they had to make it easier for the\n> Google Search box to appear.\u201d\n>\n> Houck: \u201cIf there hadn\u2019t been the lawsuit or hadn\u2019t been the [consent]\n> decree, based on their past behavior, Microsoft very well might have done\n> things that made it a lot more difficult for Google. Even with desktop\n> search, that was one of the areas we were looking at in terms of what\n> Microsoft could and couldn\u2019t do with Windows. Google was probably one of the\n> beneficiaries.\u201d\n>\n> Reback: \u201cMicrosoft had run Netscape out of the browser market. Internet\n> Explorer was literally 98% of the market. The only way you could get to\n> Google was through Microsoft. You had to go onto the Microsoft browser and\n> type www.google.com. Now if you did that, there\u2019s no reason Microsoft had to\n> send you to Google. They could have just put up the big red warning screen,\n> saying \u2018Don\u2019t click on this site. It\u2019s a bad site. It takes your personal\n> information without telling you ...\u2019 I have long asserted, based on my\n> conversations with Microsoft people, that they didn\u2019t do it because they\n> were tired of getting fined a billion euros a pop. It was clear what would\n> happen to them if they killed Google or the next generation of technology.\n> The reason they didn\u2019t do that was the threat of antitrust enforcement.\n> Because of antitrust enforcement, that\u2019s why we have Google. There is no\n> other reason.\u201d\n>\n> ... Lawrence Lessig: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to think about the right to compete\n> on the Microsoft platform and the right to compete on the Facebook or Google\n> platform. Google and Facebook create innovation platforms, but they reserve\n> the right perpetually to decide whether your application is allowed to run,\n> and they can pull the plug anytime they want, and they do. With Microsoft\n> running software on the operating system they provided, they never asserted\n> the power to determine which programs were allowed to run or not. ...\n> Microsoft might have learned a lesson and behaved in a more open or\n> respectful way with competitors, but the whole industry moved to a world\n> where the platform owner has more power than the platform owner ever\n> presumed to have in the days of Microsoft. That\u2019s an important difference,\n> which you might say undermines the significance of the case.\u201d\n>\n> Reback: \u201cThe thing about these technology industries is I can\u2019t go back and\n> fix things. If something anticompetitive happened in the airline industry, I\n> could easily go back in and fix things and break things up. They\u2019re still\n> the same planes, they\u2019re the same passengers, they\u2019re the same gates,\n> they\u2019re the same air routes. They don\u2019t change. That\u2019s not the case with\n> technology. Once a new technology is crushed, it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s not coming\n> back-ever. We can\u2019t do the same kind of fix easily. We\u2019re at a situation\n> with Google where I can\u2019t go back and restore competition. If I\u2019m going to\n> make some competition, I\u2019m going to have to do it by breaking the company\n> apart, and that becomes all the more difficult.\u201d\n\n  7. A curious not-quite example from computer gaming is offered by the rise and fall of StarCraft e-sports, caused in part by intellectual property right disputes.\n\n  8. As game engines become vast platforms/OSes themselves, they may start to engage in more commoditization plays themselves: see Epic Games venturing into not just Unreal Engine, but Epic Games Store, to the extent of funding & hosting apparent competitors like Godot (in reality, more of a threat to rival Unity).\n\n  9. WSJ:\n\n> Mukesh Ambani, head of Reliance Industries, one of India\u2019s largest\n> conglomerates, has shelled out $35 billion of the company\u2019s money to blanket\n> the South Asian nation with its first all-4G network. By offering free calls\n> and data for pennies, the telecom latecomer has upended the industry,\n> setting off a cheap internet tsunami that is opening the market of 1.3\n> billion people to global tech and retailing titans. The unknown factor: Can\n> Reliance reap profits itself after unleashing a cutthroat price war?\n> Analysts say the company\u2019s ultimate plan, after connecting the masses, is to\n> use the platform to sell content, financial services and advertising. It\n> could also recoup its massive investment in the years to come by charging\n> for high-speed broadband to consumers\u2019 homes and connections for various\n> businesses, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n  10. Nvidia, meanwhile, must worry about customers who dabble in designing their own GPU-substitute chips, particularly FANG. This may be behind the rumors that Nvidia favors (to the extent it can) allocating its cutting-edge GPUs to customers like Oracle Cloud or Coreweave or AI-software startups instead of to Amazon AWS or Google GCP.\n\n  11. One notes the structural problem for Google: because they continue to derive the majority of their revenue, and especially profits, from search engine advertising, AI is a complement right up until it\u2019s a substitute.\n\nIf a model like GPT-4 has memorized most of the facts one would query a search\nengine for, or if a model can do retrieval to read the search engine hits &\nstrip out advertisements & summarize it all for a human, how is Google going\nto make money? So if Google releases such models, they will do to themselves\nwhat Sun did with portable software: as Spolsky would ask, when all-singing\nall-dancing models render search engines into mere backends or pluggable APIs,\nand users needn\u2019t care if the AI is using Google or Microsoft Bing, \u201cwhen the\nmusic stops, where are you going to sit down?\u201d What\u2019s going to replace your\nfat profit margins on search engine ads?\n\nMS Bing, on the other hand, has no margins to sacrifice and mostly exists to\nmaintain competition as a BATNA and integrate into the MS ecosystem\u2014which is\npart of why MS is so eager to experiment in expensive erratic AI & eat\nGoogle\u2019s lunch. For MS, advanced search-engine-obsoleting AI really is a\ncommodity which makes their complement of cloud+business-suite much more\nvaluable.\n\n  12. eg. OA stopped releasing models after launching its OA API selling access to its GPT-3 models, with the striking exception of the voice-transcription+translation Whisper models\u2014which were immediately enabled on their services so you could talk in any language to their paid text-based APIs. Their competitors made money off ASR... but they didn\u2019t.\n\n  13. In an example of the curious economics of complements, Google apparently does not know how valuable Google Maps is to it, because it doesn\u2019t want to know as that would let the commoditized competitors or patent trolls more easily extract damages.\n\n  14.
