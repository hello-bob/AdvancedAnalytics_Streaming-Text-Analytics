Wrapping Up\n\n# The Ultimate Burnout Guide: Symptoms, Causes, and Prevention\n\nBurnout is real. But it's also preventable. Before someone gets totally burnt\nout at their job, there will be warning signs.\n\nThis comprehensive guide on burnout will help you identify those signs, and\nhelp you prevent burnout early enough that you hopefully won\u2019t be affected by\nit. Or if you are already burnt out, this guide will cover everything that we\ncurrently know about recovering (and as you\u2019ll soon see \u2014 it turns out that we\ndon\u2019t know a lot).\n\nWhy does this guide exist? There are already many articles written online\nabout burnout but many of these are primarily anecdotal. These stories of\nburnout are important! They tell us what it looks like in real life. But if we\nwant to stop burnout early, and deal with it before it affects us in our\ncareers, anecdotal accounts aren\u2019t good enough. We also need to examine the\nresearch.\n\nThis guide aims to fix that by summarising the best scientific studies on\nburnout (links provided, of course). After all, we don't want to base our\nunderstanding of any topic on purely anecdotal accounts.\n\nWho is this guide for? We think this guide is best read if you think you\u2019re\ninterested in preventing burnout or if you\u2019re currently affected by burnout,\nat whatever stage of career you're at.\n\nLet's get started.\n\nIf you're a Commoncog member, download the ebook copy of this guide here. If\nyou're not, fill this out to get an ebook copy:\n\n# What Is Burnout?\n\nBurnout is a psychological state caused by prolonged stress from a job.\n\nThere are three key characteristics of burnout:\n\n  1. Overwhelming exhaustion.\n  2. Feelings of cynicism.\n  3. And a sense of ineffectiveness.\n\nOriginally, researchers believed that burnout was a problem of the individual.\nBut our current understanding of burnout is that it is a stress experience\nwithin a social context.\n\nWhat does this mean? As psychologist Jacinta Jim\u00e9nez puts it: \u201ca big\ncontributing factor [of burnout] is a social environment in which a person\nworks in...\u201d Burnout pioneer Christina Maslach writes: \u201cthis three-dimensional\nmodel (...) clearly places the individual stress experience within a social\ncontext and involves the person's conception of both self and others.\u201d\n\nThe three characteristics of burnout \u2014 exhaustion, cynicism, ineffectiveness \u2014\nform a measurement known as the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The MBI is a\nwidely recognised measurement that was based on comprehensive psychometric\nresearch. It has been validated in many different languages.\n\nThe MBI is crucial in understanding what burnout is because it shows that\nthere are multiple factors before you are considered burnt out. You can be\nphysically and mentally exhausted, but not burnt out, because you don\u2019t feel\ncynical, or ineffective at your job.\n\nFor example, Mary might hate her boss, and repeated fights with him leave her\nfeeling exhausted for weeks on end. However, her job is meaningful, and she\ncontinues to be effective at accomplishing her goals. If you meet Mary after a\nseries of exhausting work battles, you might think that she looks horrible, or\nthat she might not last in her current job. But the reality is that she is far\nfrom burnt out. Exhausted, perhaps. But not burnt out.\n\n(However, if the battles don\u2019t let up, Mary may become cynical about her job,\nor may begin to fail at some of her responsibilities. If this occurs, we may\nsay that she is at higher risk of burnout. This is what burnout progression\nlooks like; we will examine the stages of burnout later on in this guide.)\n\nTraditionally, burnout was considered an occupational hazard in more people-\noriented professions, like doctors, nurses, and teachers. People in these\nroles face problems more commonly associated with service-oriented jobs, but\nalso suffer from a general expectation of dedication that most other vocations\ndo not. For instance, doctors and nurses are expected to work long hours for\ntheir patients (and they may have to deal with death on a regular basis).\nTeachers are expected to go the extra mile and give their students the best\neducation they can get. In fact, an 1981 story stated that almost every single\nuse of the word \u2018burnout\u2019 was preceded by the word \u2018teacher\u2019.\n\nBut that has changed \u2014 burnout can occur in any vocation. A good example of\nthis is the fact that COVID-19 has uprooted all facets of life. It has made\nburnout more commonplace, leading to the terms pandemic burnout, creator\nburnout, and Zoom burnout. And our change in vocabulary might have made things\nworse. Today, we need to \u2018work\u2019 in all areas of our lives. We need to work on\nour marriages. We should work on raising good kids. We might even need to work\non our relationship with God. (A New Yorker piece on burnout observes that\neven Christian websites now ask \u201cAre You at Risk for Christian Burnout?\u201d).\n\n## What Does Burnout Look Like?\n\nNow that we have a preliminary understanding of burnout and its symptoms,\nlet\u2019s colour that in with a handful of stories, to illustrate what burnout can\nlook like in real life.\n\n### Johnny Rodgers\u2019s Story\n\nJohnny Rodgers was in the midst of two major projects. It was January 2014,\nand he was one of the eight people building Slack for a public release the\nnext month. Everyone on the team was heavily committed and moving fast \u2014\nintimidatingly so. He was also launching a side project called Give. It was an\napp, three years in the making, that allowed music fans to give money directly\nto their favourite artists.\n\nHe would work nine to ten hours a day on Slack, go home, and work another\nthree to four hours on Give.\n\n> I wasn\u2019t sleeping much, and was ignoring the signs of stress that I should\n> have recognized: headaches, anxiety, and persistent self-doubt.\n>\n> I was learning a ton and proud of the work, but I was stretched to the\n> breaking point. I accommodated this by ignoring my health, drinking more\n> coffee and working harder.\n\nIt culminated in a Friday at work where Rodgers started feeling pain in his\nstomach. Eventually it got so bad that he had to go to the emergency room. He\nspent the night there, with tubes down his throat, as the doctors tried to\nfigure out what was wrong. After an exploratory surgery, the doctors\ndiscovered that his intestine was completely obstructed. It took three\noperations and another seven days before he could leave the hospital.\n\n> It is possible that I would have ended up in the hospital that night without\n> work stress. But in hindsight, it\u2019s clear to me that my body was pulling\n> rank on my brain and stopping the line. I had gone way past my limits and\n> paid a steep price for it. I was restricted in my diet and mobility for\n> months.\n\n### Michael Stephens\u2019s Story\n\nMichael Stephens was a Creative Director of Marketing at Virgin Atlantic in\nLondon. He worked long hours and juggled many big projects. On top of this, he\nhad a long commute and part of his job was to make teams redundant, which\ndidn\u2019t feel great. In his personal life, he was going through a breakup during\nthe same period. All of this tipped him \u201cover the edge\u201d.\n\n> It manifested in subtle ways to begin with. I had insomnia, and I self-\n> prescribed medication for that, which meant I could sleep, but eventually I\n> realized I couldn\u2019t sleep without the pills. Then other symptoms crept in\n> and became more prominent \u2013 IBS and eczema. Gradually my neck started to\n> hurt. One day I woke up and couldn't move it. I had to go to the GP. And she\n> immediately told me that I needed to take time off. I told her, \u201cOk. I just\n> need to go in today and make four people redundant.\u201d And she said, \u201cNo. You\n> really have to take a break now.\u201d I think at that point I called my boss. I\n> cried down the phone to them because it all suddenly became real. I took a\n> few weeks off, but because of the stigma around it I didn\u2019t feel I could\n> really share my experience with others. So, I didn\u2019t really get three weeks\n> off; I was still replying to emails and taking calls, just from home. I had\n> this realisation that I\u2019d have to change things drastically if I went back\n> to work. Or I\u2019d have to kind of go and take a long time off. I did the\n> latter. And for the first time ever I focused on my mental and physical\n> health ahead of my career ambitions.\n\n### Paula Davis\u2019s Story\n\nSimilarly, Paula Davis was a fast-charging lawyer. She was doing well; she\nclosed several multi-million dollar deals each month in 2008. But inside, she\nfelt exhausted, cynical, and ineffective.\n\n> I was exhausted, and it was a different kind of tired than I had ever\n> experienced. Getting out of bed to go to work had become exceedingly\n> difficult, if not emotionally painful. My pop out of bed, ready to start the\n> week, had become a slow drop and thud. Weekends weren\u2019t long enough to fully\n> recover (even when I didn\u2019t work), and vacations, when I actually took them,\n> provided only temporary relief. Every work or life curveball, no matter how\n> minor, became a major deal. I remember my mom calling and asking me to pick\n> up some groceries on my way out to her house, and I had a level 10 reaction\n> to her very basic request. That was not my personality, and it was a red\n> flag.\n>\n> Second, I had become cynical, even by lawyer standards. People generally\n> just started to bug me and rub me the wrong way. I remember working with\n> clients, and when they came to me with a legal issue, outwardly I was very\n> professional, but inwardly I would roll my eyes and think, \u201cReally? You\n> can\u2019t handle this on your own?\u201d Or \u201cDidn\u2019t we already talk about this?\u201d\n> Disconnecting from people was unusual for me, and I just wanted to be left\n> alone in my office.\n>\n> Third, I started to feel ineffective. I never lost confidence in my ability\n> to be a good lawyer, but I stopped seeing a clear path for myself through\n> the legal profession. I had worked at a small, boutique firm, then at a\n> large law firm, and then in-house. All of those progression boxes had been\n> checked. Now what?\n\nDavis eventually left her job, recovered, and then founded the Stress &\nResilience Institute.\n\n### Nurhaida Rahim\u2019s Story\n\nNurhaida Rahim had her dream job. She was an aid worker in the UN who worked\nin \u201chardship duty stations\u201d like South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. She said that\nshe craved the \u2018high\u2019 when she was out in the middle of nowhere, working\n10-hour days, and drinking expired beer in her container housing.\n\nBut she grew exhausted, unfulfilled and snarky. This was despite the fact that\nshe had her dream job! So she got pretty good at telling herself every morning\nto \u2018suck it up\u2019.\n\nThe main culprit? The work was relentless:\n\n> ... work was a cycle of endless meetings that led to more meetings,\n> proposals were written to bring in as much funding as possible, and\n> colleagues were juggling multiple functions. There was a sense of\n> exasperation at the slow progress of projects, and exhaustion was the only\n> currency we all collectively recognize. To walk away is almost akin to\n> saying I wasn\u2019t cut out to do this line of work. And because I\u2019ve always\n> dreamed about working in international aid, I wasn\u2019t about to give in to\n> this burnout BS (emphasis added).\n\nRahim eventually suffered from bronchitis for two months after a steady diet\nof \u201csmoking, fast food and convenience store wine\u201d. Again, she felt that she\ncouldn\u2019t complain. As an aid worker, she saw people in the community who were\n\u201cactually dealing with the real trauma of war and conflict\u201d. When placed\nagainst their plight, her troubles seem middling by comparison.\n\nIt was only at a friend\u2019s urging that she started on the road to recovery. She\ngot professional help, switched jobs, and permanently changed the way she now\ntakes care of her mental and physical health. She took a long time to heal.\n\n# What Is the Opposite of Burnout?\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen what burnout looks like, it\u2019s probably worth it to talk a\nlittle about the opposite of burnout. The opposite is interesting because it\ngives us something to aim towards. You don\u2019t want to just avoid fast food,\nafter all. You want to know what healthy food is, so you can eat more of it.\nSimilarly, it\u2019s useful to talk about something positive, instead of just\nburnout avoidance.\n\nSome burnout researchers believe that the opposite of burnout is something\ncalled \u2018work engagement\u2019, or simply \u2018engagement\u2019.\n\nThe exact definition varies among different burnout researchers. One way to\nthink about engagement is to reverse the MBI. It has three dimensions, so\nMaslach\u2019s conception of engagement also consists of those same three\ndimensions, but inverted. Thus, a highly engaged individual would have:\n\n  1. A state of high energy.\n  2. Strong involvement.\n  3. And a sense of efficacy.\n\nSince engagement research is fairly recent work \u2014 even more so than burnout \u2014\nthere remains no clear consensus on the model of engagement. It\u2019s something\nthat continues to be debated. But the engagement model that is most often\nreferenced in scientific literature is the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale\n(UWES).\n\nUWES\u2019s definition of worker engagement is based on three factors:\n\n  1. Vigor.\n  2. Dedication.\n  3. And absorption.\n\nUWES is a 17 question measurement that employees (and even students) may take\nonline. Its effectiveness has been tested across different nationalities,\nraces, and jobs with minimal differences.\n\nTo have a real life example of someone who would score highly on the UWES,\nlet\u2019s talk about William:\n\n> William loves his work and can talk about it really enthusiastically. Every\n> day he feels driven to excel and he throws himself into work passionately.\n> He finds his job challenging, exciting, and enjoyable, and does much more\n> than is requested, just for the fun of it. William has the autonomy to be\n> creative, and has the feeling that he learns new things all the time.\n> Although he is always busy and is usually completely immersed in his work,\n> he rarely feels tired or exhausted. Instead, work seems to give him energy,\n> and every day he feels happy to start working again. Even if he sometimes\n> faces difficulties, William persists. He is really dedicated to his work and\n> finds that he deals with interesting and important issues. Nevertheless, he\n> can relax and dis-engage from work and he knows how to downplay his work.\n> Although he often gets totally absorbed by his work, there are also other\n> things outside work that he enjoys to the fullest. William\u2019s motto is: work\n> is fun!\n\nYou and I are probably not experiencing what William is experiencing, but we\ncan get there! To enhance work engagement we can:\n\n  1. Collaborate. Enhancing work engagement is something you do with someone, not to someone. Leaders should attempt to build a process that encourages work creativity and enthusiasm.\n  2. Establish an ongoing process. Work engagement is an ongoing process, not a one time event. Leaders should understand that it requires constant monitoring, adaptation, and action.\n  3. Know your target. Engagement has taken on many meanings, but what does it mean in your case?\n  4. Be creative. There are no hard-and-fast rules for building work engagement. Systematic research is still unfolding and every company is different, which will determine what works to some extent. Adapt to your situation.\n  5. Evaluate. Gather feedback on the impact of work engagement initiatives, evaluate them and improve on it.\n  6. Share. Provide progress reports on work engagement.\n\nFor more details, you may find the six points for enhancing work engagement\nbelow.\n\nIn short, employers and employees should understand that engagement is\nsomething worth measuring and aiming for. Many researchers believe the higher\nthe engagement, the lower the chance of burnout.\n\n# The Development of Work Burnout\n\nIt is not enough to have an assessment model of burnout. In order to act, we\nalso need a developmental model \u2014 that is, a framework for burnout\nprogression. The development of burnout is often described in sequential\nstages.\n\nA very simplified model of how burnout develops is to take the MBI and to talk\nabout which dimension develops first. Maslach writes that exhaustion usually\ndevelops first, perhaps in response to a high workload. Exhaustion then leads\nto cynicism, which takes on the form of detachment and negative reactions\ntowards their work and to their colleagues. Then, finally, a person becomes\nineffective at their job.\n\nHowever, we can get more precise about how burnout develops. Today, the two\nmost accepted developmental models of burnout are the Job Demands-Resources\n(JD-R) model and Conservation of Resources (COR) model, both of which are more\ngranular than the simplified MBI-based stages above. We\u2019ll take a look at each\nmodel in turn.\n\n## The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model\n\nThe JD-R model classifies every occupation into two general categories: job\ndemands and job resources. Job demands are physical, psychological, social or\norganisational aspects of the job that require effort and come with a cost.\nThese could be long work hours, high work pressure, and demanding interactions\nwith bosses. But these factors are not necessarily negative! Instead, they can\nbecome negative if they don\u2019t let up and prevent the employee from getting\nadequate rest.\n\nMeanwhile, job resources are physical, psychological, social or organisational\naspects of the job that help the employee achieve their work goals, reduce\ntheir job demands and costs, and stimulate personal growth. The more job\nresources one has, the more job demands can be safely put on you.\n\nThis theory has been tested across multiple studies, and the results of these\nstudies are fairly consistent. Figure 3 and 4, for instance, were taken from a\n2006 study that tested employees from two home care organisations. The\nresearchers found that home care workers were more resilient towards\nexhaustion and cynicism when they were given job resources like high levels of\nfeedback and autonomy, even in the face of high levels of physical engagement\nand patient harassment. Figure 5 and 6 were taken from a 2006 study of Finnish\nteachers working in elementary, secondary, and vocational schools. Those\nresearchers found that teachers were better able to cope with pupil\nmisbehaviour when they were supported with high levels of innovation\norientation and appreciation in the work culture (by \u2018innovation orientation\u2019,\nthe researchers meant that teachers were able to give suggestions and were\nencouraged to put forward new ideas to improve their work (Bakker et al.\n2006)).\n\nBoth these graphs, along with other studies cited in Bakker et al\u2019s review\npaper, show that high job resources under conditions of high job demands help\nameliorate the effects of burnout.\n\nIt\u2019s probably worth it to take a few seconds and skim through the various job\ndemands and resources that are cited in the Bakker review paper below. These\nshould give you an idea of the job demands and resources that might be\navailable at your workplace.\n\nJob Demands| Job Resources  \n---|---  \nGeneral  \nHigh work pressure| Salary  \nUnfavourable physical environment| Career opportunities  \nEmotionally demanding interactions with clients| Job security  \nSupervisor and co-worker support  \nParticipation in decision making  \nSkill variety  \nTask significance  \nAutonomy  \nPerformance feedback  \nHome care organisation employees  \nPatient Harassment| Autonomy  \nPhysical demands| Support  \nOpportunities for professional development  \nFinnish teachers in elementary, secondary, and vocation schools  \nPupil misbehaviour| Supervisor support  \nInnovativeness  \nAppreciation  \nOrganisational climate  \n  \n### How Do We Use This?\n\nAs an employee, if you have constant high job demands that never seem to let\nup, you need to take advantage of the job resources that are available to you.\n\nMore specifically, you need to be given autonomy in your job, you need to\nreceive fair and effective feedback, and you should have social support and\nhigh-quality relationships with your supervisor. The primary caveat here is\nthat you do not have full control of the job resources available to you, since\nthis is a function of your direct manager, company leadership, and the work\nenvironment.\n\nIf you are an employer, understand that your employees can have high job\ndemands and not be at risk of burnout if you provide them with high job\nresources. Build a better work culture that includes more feedback loops,\nallow employees to work autonomously, and dedicate time to cultivate a high\nquality relationship with your employees.\n\n## The Conservation of Resources (COR) Model\n\nThe Conservation of Resources (COR) model offers another explanation on how\nwork burnout develops. The COR model theorises that individuals \u201cstrive to\nobtain and maintain that which they value\u201d, which it calls \u2018resources\u2019. When\nwork prevents people from obtaining or maintaining those resources, stress\nfollows, which eventually leads to burnout. More specifically, stress\naccumulates when:\n\n  1. Resources are threatened.\n  2. Resources are lost.\n  3. And when people invest resources and don\u2019t reap the expected benefits.\n\nResources may be defined as:\n\n  1. Objects \u2014 nice clothes, cars.\n  2. Conditions \u2014 employment, marriage, social status.\n  3. Personal characteristics \u2014 public speaking skills, networking ability.\n  4. Expendables \u2014 time, energy.\n\nOccasionally, people invest resources like their time and energy in the\npursuit of higher prized resources like power and money. If they invest such\nresources and don\u2019t reap the expected benefits, this is also considered a\nloss.\n\nWhen these personal resources are lost and the employee is unable to recoup\nthose losses, the employee becomes at risk of burnout.\n\nGiven that the JD-R and COR models are so similar, you might ask: what\u2019s the\ndifference between them?\n\nThe difference is that the COR model acknowledges the primacy of loss. In\nother words, it recognises that loss is more salient than gain. People who\nlose resources will need a higher amount of resources gained to offset the\nloss.\n\nIn some ways this is a more realistic theory. For example, if you have a lot\ninvested in a project and management decides to kill the project, you are\nlikely going to need a period of recovery in order to offset that loss.\n\n## Areas of Worklife Scale (AWS)\n\nThis brings us to a newer, less-established, but perhaps more actionable\nmodel. The Areas of Worklife Scale (AWS) is a measurement created by Michael\nLeiter and Christina Maslach based on the burnout literature over the past two\ndecades. It is a tool designed not just for academic researchers but for\npractitioners as well.\n\nWhen Leiter and Maslach reviewed studies of burnout and job stress, they\nidentified six key domains that placed someone at risk of burnout.\n\n1) Workload\n\nThis is the most obvious and commonly discussed area of worklife. People who\nhave too much to do in too little time, with too few resources are at risk of\nburnout, particularly on the exhaustion dimension. Again, not all high\nworkloads lead to burnout. High workloads are manageable if people are given\nopportunities or resources to recover.\n\n2) Control\n\nThis area represents the \u201cemployees perceived capacity to influence decisions\nthat affect their work, to exercise professional autonomy, and to gain access\nto the resources necessary to do an effective job.\u201d Employees who have little\ncontrol in their work are at risk of feeling ineffective at their job (one of\nthe three dimensions of MBI).\n\n3) Reward\n\nThe most obvious reward is monetary, but this area of worklife also includes\nsocial and intrinsic rewards. Lack of recognition (social reward) can devalue\nthe work and the workers. It is closely associated with feelings of\ninefficacy. Intrinsic rewards, like pride in doing something important and\ndoing it well, should be cultivated too.\n\n4) Community\n\nCommunity represents the \u201coverall quality of social interaction at work,\nincluding issues of conflict, mutual support, closeness, and the capacity to\nwork as a team.\u201d Today\u2019s work community, with permanent or hybrid remote work\nschemes, can look very different from that of pre-COVID times. Regardless, a\nlack of social support or chronic conflict with coworkers remains a key factor\nin causing burnout.\n\n5) Fairness\n\nFairness represents the \u201cextent to which decisions at work are perceived as\nbeing fair and people are treated with respect.\u201d In the workplace that can\nlook like fair hiring and promotion processes. Even if the outcome is\nunfavourable to a particular employee \u2014 like a promotion that was passed up \u2014\nas long as that employee believes that the process was fair, they will be\nokay. Mass layoffs and corporate restructuring, like those that happened\nduring the worst of the COVID-19 lockdowns, can reveal to employees the\ninherent fairness or unfairness at their workplace.\n\n6) Values\n\nValues \u201cencompasses the ideals and motivations that originally attracted [the\nemployee] to the job.\u201d It goes beyond money or advancement. It is the\nalignment of company values and actions with the employee\u2019s personal set of\nvalues and actions. If misaligned, the worker is at risk to all three\ndimensions of burnout.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of what we\u2019ve covered:\n\nArea of Worklife| Definition| To reduce the risk of burnout  \n---|---|---  \nWorkload| The number of things one needs to get done in a set amount of time\nwith a set number of resources.| Give employees enough opportunities to\nrecover at work or at home after busy periods.  \nControl| Perceived capacity to influence decisions that affect their work, to\nexercise professional autonomy, and to gain access to the resources necessary\nto do an effective job.| Give more control to employees so they have more (or\nfeel more) autonomy at their job.  \nReward| Monetary, social, and intrinsic rewards at work.| Recognise employees\nfor good work and build a culture where they are proud of the work they do.  \nCommunity| The overall quality of social interaction at work, including issues\nof conflict, mutual support, closeness, and the capacity to work as a team.|\nPrioritise personal and workplace support structures and reduce the number of\nchronic workplace conflicts.  \nFairness| The extent to which decisions at work are perceived as being fair\nand people are treated with respect.| Implement fair hiring and promotion\nprocesses.  \nValues| The ideals and motivations that originally attracted the employee to\nthe job.| Align the company\u2019s actions with its stated values.  \n  \nLeiter and Maslach propose that the greater the mismatch between the person\nand the job in the six areas of worklife, the greater the likelihood of\nburnout. The opposite is true too: the greater the match, the more engaged the\nperson. However, there is a complex interrelationship between the six areas.\nFor example, you can\u2019t make changes to reduce your workload if you have no\ncontrol in the first place.\n\nTherefore, Leiter and Maslach have hypothesised the model below, known as the\nMediation Model, that illustrates the relationships between the six areas of\nworklife and the three dimensions of burnout. The Mediation Model is an\norganisational change model \u2014 meaning that it is intended to serve as a guide\nfor leaders who want to reorient their organisations against workplace\nburnout.\n\nInstead of a simple additive model \u2014 where a mismatch in any one of the six\nAreas of Worklife domains contributes to a higher chance of burnout \u2014 Leiter\nand Maslach propose a more complex interrelationship. They hypothesise that\nbecause \u2018control\u2019 is so central to the employee\u2019s ability to influence the\npeople and processes that determine their quality of work life, it is treated\nas the starting point in the Mediation Model. Control affects their ability to\ninfluence other areas like \u2018workload\u2019, \u2018reward\u2019, \u2018community\u2019, and \u2018fairness\u2019.\nThen the area of \u2018values\u2019 integrates and mediates between the six Areas of\nWorklife (except \u2018workload\u2019) and the MBI. Within the MBI, it\u2019s hypothesised\nthat exhaustion predicts cynicism, which in turn predicts inefficacy. And all\nthree dimensions of the MBI predict the \u2018outcome of evaluation of change\u2019 \u2014\nwhich the researchers take to mean whether employees perceive the organisation\nas changing for the better or worse.\n\n# How to Prevent Burnout\n\nIf you only read about burnout via mainstream sources, it may seem like there\nare many options to prevent the three dimensions of burnout at an individual\nlevel. But this is misleading.\n\nMaslach points out that \u201cthere is very little research that has evaluated the\nefficacy of any of these approaches in reducing the risk of burnout.\nEspecially rare are studies modeled even loosely on randomized control\ntrials.\u201d\n\nSomething that becomes clear the more you read burnout literature is how much\nthe researchers emphasise that burnout is not solely an individual phenomenon;\nit is also caused by social and organisational factors. This means that many\nproven strategies are rightfully focused on an organisational context instead\nof an individual one.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense: as an employee, there is little you can do if you\nare burning out at a bad company; whereas if you are a manager, you have more\npower and therefore more ability to change things.\n\nNonetheless, here are some strategies to prevent the three dimensions of\nburnout.\n\n## Prevent Exhaustion\n\n  * Moderate workload demands\n\n    * Work less \u2014 not always doable, but most people need recovery periods after periods of high output and stress.\n    * Take more breaks\n    * Avoid overtime work\n  * Get better sleep\n\n    * Get sunlight or bright light exposure during the day.\n    * Reduce exposure to artificial light at night.\n  * Exercise \u2014 physical activity may reduce burnout.\n\n  * Nutrition \u2014 consider reducing the intake of highly processed foods and red meat while increasing the intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n\n## Prevent Cynicism\n\nCynicism relates more to the employee\u2019s alignment of personal values with the\nworkplace.\n\n  * Improve civility at work \u2014 at an individual level this is not easily accomplished, but moving teams or taking a remote assignment may help. At an organisational level, this demands a cultural change.\n  * Strengthen support from coworkers and supervisors \u2014 implementing management best practices such as regular one-on-one meetings would help with this.\n\n## Prevent Ineffectiveness\n\n  * Build a work culture where accomplishments are recognised and celebrated.\n  * Perform regular feedback and performance evaluations.\n  * Ensure that performance evaluations are done according to a fair scale.\n\nAs per the Mediation Model from the Areas of Worklife Scale (AWS), there is\none catch to implementing these strategies in preventing burnout. An employee\nfirst needs to have control in their work life. It is the foundation which\nallows the employee to take action in order to prevent burnout.\n\n## What Burnout Prevention Looks Like\n\nAt this point, it may be helpful to walk through two anecdotes of individuals\nwho seem able to prevent burnout in the real world. Read these anecdotes with\nthe burnout models above in mind \u2014 one question you might want to ask is: do\nany of them lack for control or job resources?\n\n### Marissa Mayer\u2019s Story\n\nMarissa Mayer was a former CEO at Yahoo and Vice President at Google (where\nshe was employee number 20). Her days at Google were extremely long, clocking\nover 130 hours a week. She said \u201cit was a lot of hard work,\u201d and that she\npulled \u201can all-nighter every week.\u201d Although she had to deal with this for her\nfirst five years at Google, she was careful to avoid burnout by \u201cfinding her\nrhythm\u201d.\n\nMayer believed that we all have \u201cone activity that matters so much that we\ncan\u2019t afford to miss it.\u201d If we miss it, we start becoming resentful, and this\ncontributes to burning out. That non-negotiable activity could be a movie\nnight every Friday, a dinner with family every Sunday, or going to the gym\nthree times a week. She argued that this was different for everyone, but once\nyou found it, you should never skip it. An Entrepreneur magazine article\ndescribes her philosophy like so:\n\n> Step 1. Watch for signs of resentment. \u201dBurnout is about resentment,\" Mayer\n> told the audience at 92Y. \u201c[Preventing it is] about knowing yourself well\n> enough to know what it is you're giving up that makes you resentful.\"\n>\n> Her assessment is right on target. \"The question is whether you can\n> replenish your energy when you get tired,\" says Michael Leiter, professor of\n> psychology at Acadia University in Nova Scotia. If you can't restore your\n> energy or resolve your values conflict with your work, you feel exhausted,\n> cynical, and discouraged \u2014 the hallmarks of burnout.\n>\n> Step 2. Find your rhythm. Mayer's theory is that you need to figure out what\n> your \"rhythm\" is, meaning the activity that matters so much to you\n> resentment sets in when you can't do it. In Leiter's words, it's the\n> activity that restores your energy. That might mean sleeping eight hours a\n> night, practicing yoga daily, or getting out in nature once a week. Whatever\n> it is, it's essential to your satisfaction, so don't skip it.\n>\n> \"People \u2014 particularly entrepreneurs \u2014 can put in huge amounts of energy and\n> time,\" Leiter says. \"Overwork doesn't burn people out per se, but it's doing\n> that without knowing the things that replenish you.\"\n>\n> Step 3. Grant employees one must-have freedom. When Mayer suspects an\n> employee might burn out, she asks them to find their rhythm. They've come\n> back with, \"I need to be home for Tuesday night dinners,\" or \"I need to be\n> on time for my daughter's soccer games.\" She grants those needs \u2014 no\n> exceptions.\n>\n> \"You can't have everything you want,\" Mayer cautions. \"But you can have the\n> things that really matter to you. That empowers you to work really hard for\n> a long period of time on something that you're passionate about.\"\n\n\u201cFind your rhythm and make it non-negotiable.\u201d This strategy worked for Mayer,\nbut it\u2019s worth noting that she had strong autonomy in her role, to offset the\nequally extreme job demands placed on her. It may work for her, in her\ncontext, but it may not work for you.\n\n### Cal Newport\u2019s Story\n\nCal Newport is a computer science professor at Georgetown University and a New\nYork Times best selling author. He also writes for a variety of outlets like\nThe New Yorker, for his blog, and he started his own podcast in 2020. As such,\nhe has to deal with a very high workload and still strike a balance between\nwork and family life as a father of three kids.\n\nIn a podcast with Lex Fridman, Newport explained his method for preventing\nburnout. Newport\u2019s trick is to operate in seasons across different time\nscales. What that means is that he cycles between high and low intensity\nperiods of work. During the low intensity periods, he\u2019ll get more time to\nrest. And this is applied across different time scales \u2014 quarterly, monthly,\nand weekly. If Newport goes hard at it for one semester, then he\u2019ll take it\neasy the next semester. If he spends his mornings and afternoons doing deep\nwork, he\u2019ll put a hard stop on it by 5PM. Sprint, rest, and repeat.\n\nAgain, notice Newport\u2019s degree of control over his work life, and the implicit\njob resources available to him. To some degree, Newport chose this job due to\nthe autonomy it afforded him \u2014 in So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You he wrote that\nhe chose a position at Georgetown University due to the higher autonomy it\nwould give him.\n\n# How to Recover From Burnout\n\nHere\u2019s the bad news: we know very little about recovering from burnout. What\nwe do know are two things:\n\n  1. Individual interventions don\u2019t work \u2014 and by individual interventions we mean interventions while the person continues to be at the workplace that caused the burnout.\n  2. If you remove yourself from that working environment, you will recover.\n\nLet\u2019s repeat that again, with more force: most studied individual\ninterventions do not work. Mindfulness doesn\u2019t work. Meditation doesn\u2019t work.\nQigong doesn\u2019t work. The only thing that works is to remove yourself from the\nenvironment that is causing burnout, and then taking the time off to recover.\nThe good news is that recovery is guaranteed. One meta analysis that examined\nfourteen different burnout intervention studies in 2017 concludes, \u201cburnout is\nnot a stable phenomenon; it diminishes in time and the majority of sufferers\ncontinue working.\u201d In other words, once you have removed yourself from the\nwork environment where you got burnt out, it is only a matter of time before\nyou fully recover.\n\n# Wrapping Up\n\nSo what have we shown you? We have shown you that burnout really consists of\nthree dimensions: exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. We then introduced the\nconcept of \u2018engagement\u2019, which is the opposite of burnout, and then walked you\nthrough three different developmental models for burnout.\n\nThe biggest takeaway you should have from this guide is that burnout is really\na \u2018stress experience within a social environment\u2019. You can\u2019t prevent burnout\nif you don\u2019t have power over the workplace you\u2019re in \u2014 which means it is\nreally important to pick the right workplaces that best fits your goals.\n\nNote that we are not saying \u2018pick places that are low stress\u2019, or \u2018be\nunambitious and pick easy jobs\u2019. What the burnout research shows us is that\npicking workplaces with high job demands is perfectly alright, provided it\u2019s\nalso backed up with a commensurate level of job resources \u2014 or at least a good\nunderstanding of recovery from \u2018loss\u2019.\n\nThis guide is arguably more important for leaders and managers. Since you have\npower over your org, it is up to you to change the organisation for the\nbetter. The best model for such change is probably the \u2018Areas of Worklife\nScale\u2019 \u2014 which tells you the order in which you should tackle each factor of\nworkplace stress.\n\nFor the rest of us \u2014 our hope is that this guide gives you a better\nunderstanding of burnout, a more granular ability to judge prospective\nworkplaces, and a set of useful lenses to evaluate the many anecdotal accounts\nof burnout you might find on the web.\n\nWe hope you will never need to experience severe burnout. Godspeed and good\nluck.\n\nIf you're a Commoncog member, download the ebook copy of this guide here.
