When running on Windows, using the latest service\npack of the .NET Framework on Windows 7 is recommended.Support for running on\nMono 2.0 or higher has been added. When running on Mono, using version 2.10 or\nhigher is recommended, as several critical issues have been identified and\nfixed.Support for running on .NET Core 2.0 or higher has been added.  \nLatest Stable Release  \nThe beta 54 source, binary, and setup packages are now available. They have\nbeen extensively tested and should be considered \"release candidate\" quality.\nPlease test them in your environment and report any issues you encounter.For\nsecurity purposes, all of the executable files available for download on this\nwebsite, including the self-extracting archives, have been digitally signed by\n\"Mistachkin Systems\" (i.e. Joe Mistachkin). Please verify that the digital\nsignatures are intact after downloading.In addition, all RAR archive files\nshould have valid \"authenticity verification\" information. Please note that\nthe \"authenticity verification\" information for RAR archive files is not\ncryptographically secure and can be forged by a determined adversary;\ntherefore, the self-extracting archives should be downloaded and used instead,\nwhenever possible (i.e. on Windows).To determine if you are running the latest\nbuild available, use the \"#check\" command at the interactive shell prompt. To\nsee detailed version information, use the \"#version\" command at the\ninteractive shell prompt. For more details on the latest changes, refer to the\n\"ChangeLog\" file included in the distribution.Beta 1.0.8613.27347 (9MB) Setup\nfor Windows (NetFx20)More Downloads  \nDevelopment & Source Code  \nThere is now a publicly accessible Fossil repository for Eagle available here\nwith mirrors available here and here.The very latest source code is [also]\nalways available from the trunk of the repository in the ZIP file format.  \nObtaining & Using Fossil  \nThe very latest \"stable release\" of the Fossil (for Windows) tool itself, as a\nself-contained executable file, with all compile-time features enabled, may be\ndownloaded directly from within the Eagle repository itself.It has been\ndigitally signed by \"Mistachkin Systems\" and this should be verified via\nmanual inspection or another trusted tool prior to making use of it.  \nPapers & Presentations  \nEagle was presented at the 2012 Lang.NEXT Conference.Garuda was presented at\nthe 18th Annual Tcl/Tk Conference.Eagle was presented at the Alt.NET 2011\nSeattle Conference.Eagle was the subject of a paper at the 17th Annual Tcl/Tk\nConference, see \"Tcl 2010 Conference Proceedings\", ISBN\n978-0-578-07483-2.Eagle was the subject of a paper at the 16th Annual Tcl/Tk\nConference, see \"Tcl 2009 Conference Proceedings\", ISBN\n978-0-578-04533-7.Eagle was presented at the 2009 Lang.NET Symposium.Eagle was\nthe subject of a paper at the 15th Annual Tcl/Tk Conference, see \"Tcl 2008\nConference Proceedings\", ISBN 978-0-578-00296-5.  \n  \nLocal Links\n\n  * Downloads\n  * Support & Consulting\n  * Development Team\n  * Tutorials & Walkthroughs\n  * Source Repository\n\nEagle Links\n\n  * Live REPL (\"safe\")\n  * CodePlex Project (Internet Archive)\n  * SourceForge Project\n\nTcl/Tk Links\n\n  * Tcl SourceForge Project\n  * Tcl/Tk Source Repository\n  * Tcl Developer Xchange\n  * Tcl TIP Collection\n  * The Tcler's Wiki\n  * Tcl on Rosetta Code\n  * Tcl Command Reference\n  * Tcl Tutorial\n  * Tcl Wikibook\n  * Tcl/Tk Engineering Manual\n  * Tcl Style Guide\n  * KitCreator Fossil Repository\n  * ActiveState Tcl Distribution and Tools\n  * ActiveState Teapot\n  * Equi 4 Software (Critcl, Metakit, Starkits, Tclkit)\n  * comp.lang.tcl FAQ (Internet Archive)\n  * comp.lang.tcl FAQ (Purl)\n  * comp.lang.tcl (USENET)\n  * comp.lang.tcl (Google)\n  * Tcl/Tk IRC Channel\n  * TkChat Client\n  * TkChat Instructions\n  * The Fossil SCM\n\n  \n  \nCopyright \u00a9 2007-2012 by Joe Mistachkin.
