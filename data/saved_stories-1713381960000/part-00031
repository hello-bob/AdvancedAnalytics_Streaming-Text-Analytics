It is collaboratively developed,\nwith freely available source code, and underpins most technology in use. A\n2024 Harvard study valued it at $8.8 trillion.\n\nA software project may be initially undertaken by a single developer as a\nhobbyist project, but writing a piece of code is just the beginning.\nMaintenance and security updates require long-term commitments, often by an\nentire community of developers.\n\nThere is insufficient incentive for additional developers to get involved to\nmaintain a project. Allowing skilled developers to volunteer on open-source\nprojects and deduct related expenses, including a portion of their time\ndedicated to these projects, would recognize their invaluable work and\nencourage broader participation and, thereby, oversight.\n\n## Status Quo\n\nThe idea of providing an open-source tax credit for developers with financial\noutlays for things such as software and equipment isn\u2019t new. Such a credit,\nwhich has been proposed at the state level, conceivably would further their\ncontributions to free and open-source projects.\n\nBut in the years since those initiatives died on the vine, world economies\nhave only become more reliant on open-source projects. The recent XZ incident,\nwherein a piece of malicious code was found to be hidden for years in a common\nutility, underscores the risks of wringing value from such projects without\nproviding a benefit in return\u2014or at least helping to offset costs.\n\nThe alternative is to let corporations, educational institutions, government\nentities, and everyone in between continue to lean on open-source projects\nwithout sufficient oversight or adequate compensation for those who develop\nand maintain these projects.\n\n## FLOSS Credit\n\nA tax credit for up to $2,000 of costs associated with contributions to a\nproject, the code of which is released under an open-source license, would go\na long way toward motivating more developers to get involved.\n\nSuch a credit would enable more developers to invest their time and resources\ninto securing and enhancing open-source projects. Instead of demanding\ndevelopers moonlight doing what they do for a living for free, they would be\nworking to offset their tax burden, converting their volunteer efforts into a\nrecognized contribution to the software commons.\n\nThe broader implications of such a credit are as important as the financial\nbenefits. In addition to immediate financial assistance to open-source\ndevelopers, such a policy would acknowledge the social value of open-source\ndevelopment.\n\nEquating such contributions to more traditional charitable endeavors signals\nappreciation for the role such projects and their contributors play in\nadvancing technology, education, and access.\n\nContributions to open-source projects are the software developer equivalent to\nmedical doctors who engage in charitable practices and attorneys who take on\npro-bono projects. Recognizing their work as such would help mitigate\nfinancial barriers to participation and align developers\u2019 interests with the\nbroader societal benefit of a secure and robust open-source software sector.\n\n## Administrative Challenges\n\nImplementing such a credit system would of course face some challenges, such\nas the feasibility of quantifying contributions\u2014or how an individual software\ndeveloper\u2019s labor should be valued in their contribution to a given project.\nSetting an hourly rate for calculating labor contributions would be the\nsimplest policy solution.\n\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean hourly wage for a\nsoftware developer in May 2023 was $66.40\u2014the hourly rate for purposes of an\nopen-source tax credit calculation should be adjusted with the mean hourly\nwage or a comparable metric.\n\nThe risk of fraudulent claims can\u2019t be overstated, as it can be difficult to\nprove and quantify contributions made to a project. This is why the policy\ndesign for such an open-source tax credit should be undertaken with input from\nopen-source communities, tax policy experts, and policymakers.\n\nModern collaborative tools and platforms for software development, such as\nGitHub and GitLab, offer traceable records of individual contributions through\ncode repository logs. Code contributions can be quantified and proven, and\nsuch a tax credit is feasible given community involvement\u2014open-source policy\ndesign to help mold and form the open-source tax credit.\n\nSuch an initiative to provide a tax credit for open-source software would\naddress a critical blind spot in our technological infrastructure. It would\nincentivize contributions by software developers that might otherwise be\nunable to lend their talents to open-source projects, plus strengthen the\nsecurity and robustness of open-source software\u2014thereby ensuring its\nsustainable development in a world increasingly reliant upon it.\n\nAndrew Leahey is a tax and technology attorney, principal at Hunter Creek\nConsulting, and adjunct professor at Drexel Kline School of Law.
