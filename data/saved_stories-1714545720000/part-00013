Not only\n> is finding data to adequately probe particular model properties difficult,\n> but evaluating the correctness of a model's freeform generation alone is a\n> challenge. To address this, many evaluations now rely on using LLMs\n> themselves as judges to score the quality of outputs from other LLMs.\n> Evaluations most commonly use a single large model like GPT4. While this\n> method has grown in popularity, it is costly, has been shown to introduce\n> intramodel bias, and in this work, we find that very large models are often\n> unnecessary. We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm\n> evaluators (PoLL). Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six\n> different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of\n> smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model\n> bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while\n> being over seven times less expensive.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.18796 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.18796v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.18796arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Pat Verga [view email] [v1] Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:33:23 UTC (7,795 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Replacing Judges with Juries: Evaluating LLM\nGenerations with a Panel of Diverse Models, by Pat Verga and 8 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
