The New UI for APT Adds a Splash of Color to Improve Readability\n\nIt's time for an upgrade to the APT tool. And, this one's pretty meaningful.\n\n, and Sourav Rudra\n\nApril 16, 2024 . 3:59 PM\n\n2 min read\n\n  * X\n  * Share on Facebook\n\n  * Share on Pinterest\n\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Share via Email\n\nAdvanced Packaging Tool (APT) is a very popular package manager found on\nDebian, and other popular Linux distros based on it. It is used to manage all\nthe packages on a Linux system and to also install new ones, such as\napplications, command-line tools, etc.\n\nThough, many users don't like how APT presents information when running\ncommands. Hence, some switch to tools like Nala, which is like APT but better\nat presenting information while also offering cool features like parallel\ndownloads, an easy-to-use interface, and more.\n\nFedora's DNF is also a good example with how the information is displayed.\n\nLuckily, APT is stepping up its game, and is now moving towards a more\ncolorful, user-friendly future.\n\nIntrigued? Then keep on reading!\n\n## More Colors with APT: What to Expect?\n\nIntroduced a few days back in a very low-key manner, APT 2.9 (unstable) was\nreleased with an updated user interface that now sports colors, displays\ninformation in padded columns, and an organized package removals list.\n\nThis also marks the beginning of the APT 3.0 development series, which will\nsurely feature extra refinements and upgrades to make this widely used package\nmanager more potent.\n\nI tried this it out on a Debian-equipped virtual machine, and I must say, I\nwas not disappointed. \ud83d\ude03\n\nWhen I tried installing GIMP using APT 2.9, all the information was arranged\nquite neatly, and I never got confused as to which packages were being added;\nthe columns and colors helped too.\n\nTo wrap this up, I will say that these changes certainly improve APT's\nreadability, and for newer users, they can now be better informed of what APT\nis doing when they run one of its commands.\n\n## Want to try it out?\n\nWell, if you can wait, then distro releases later this year could feature APT\n3.0/2.9, with these changes, alongside a few others.\n\nBut if you would rather not wait and experiment, then you can install a more\nrecent Debian release and edit the source.list file to use the unstable\nbranch. Once done, update APT using the following command:\n\n    \n    \n    sudo apt install apt\n\nYou can also refer to APT 2.9's Debian Package page to learn more.\n\nAPT 2.9 (unstable)\n\n\ud83d\udcac Do you like the way APT is headed? No? Add your opinion in the comments\nbelow!\n\nSuggested Read \ud83d\udcd6\n\nApt++? Nala is Like Apt in Ubuntu but Better\n\nNala is a Python-based frontend for apt package management. Inspired by the\nDNF package manager, Nala seems like a promising tool for Ubuntu and Debian\nusers.\n\nIt's FOSSSagar Sharma\n\n## More from It's FOSS...\n\n  * Learn Bash scripting for FREE with this Bash Tutorial series.\n  * Join our community forum.\n  * \ud83d\udce9 Stay updated with the latest on Linux and Open Source.
