So that\u2019s part of it.\n\nBut it\u2019s more that than. It\u2019s more of a justice thing, really.\n\nLook at this screenshot.\n\nThis is software my neighborhood uses to manage guest parking passes. It\u2019s\nshit. Maybe you recognize it, maybe you don\u2019t, but the name doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nYou know what the company charges for the privilege of using it? $10,000/year.\n$10,000 A YEAR! $10,000 year after year of our HOA budget goes to this crap.\nIt feels borderline criminal.\n\nI\u2019m still doing this because the world is flooded with overpriced, crappy,\nsubpar software. It hurts people and it hurts the economy.\n\nI feel a moral obligation to do what I can to replace bad options with great\noptions, at vastly reduced prices. I even want to replace great options with\nequally great options, just at reduced prices. Good software should not be\nexpensive.\n\nSoftware is an absolute miracle. You can make exceptionally good stuff at\nexceptionally reasonable prices. It\u2019s not like hardware manufacturing where\nyou have to cut all sorts of corners to keep costs in check, or charge a ton\nfor stuff that\u2019s truly well made. Raw materials, machinery, manufacturing,\ntight tolerances, physics \u2014 this stuff costs a lot to get right. Software does\nnot.\n\nYet bad \u2014 and great software, frankly \u2014 remains way over priced. And some is\nabsolute highway robbery. Like this parking pass software. It\u2019s clear no one\ncared about it \u2014 it\u2019s just built to some spec by people who will never use it.\nIt\u2019s all there, the features tick the boxes, and technically it works, but\nwe\u2019d never ever find it acceptable if it was a physical product. But since\nit\u2019s software, it can suck and we can still be sold on a $10,000/year\ncontract.\n\nThis fuels me.\n\nSo hell yeah I\u2019m motivated. And the more bad stuff I bump into, or even great\nstuff with silly numbers attached, the more motivated I get. It\u2019s a deep well\nthat keeps on providing.\n\nTo that end, we\u2019ve just started working on two more new products this year.\nWe\u2019re on a tear. We\u2019re going to keep on putting quality stuff out there at\nreasonable prices. Not just to prove that it can be done, but because it must\nbe done.\n\n-Jason\n\nAbout Jason Fried\n\nHey!
