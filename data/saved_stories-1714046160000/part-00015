Augment Kevin with super powers!\u201d\n>\n> Me\n\nIf you think about what software engineers actually do and what AI excels at,\nyou should reach the same conclusion. It\u2019s easy to anthropomorphize AI tools,\nespecially when you\u2019re chatting with them and considering their portrayal in\nscience fiction. With that in mind, I believe in creating systems that\nresemble J.A.R.V.I.S more than HAL.\n\nAs we develop these systems, it\u2019s essential to remember that humans and\ncomputers have unique strengths. The real magic happens when humans take\ncharge, supported by ever-present, fully connected computer systems.\n\nBy doing so, we can not only improve life for developers individually, but\nalso empower teams and organizations to accomplish much more with reduced toil\nand communication costs.\n\nI\u2019m passionate at doing my part to help here, and I want to share my journey\nto Augment with you.\n\n## Seeing the future of software development\n\nI love programming. Whenever I write some code, it tends to be a good day.\nThere is something about the creative process that ends with something\ntangible that is good for my brain. Any platforms, tools, or services that\nallow me to stay in that certain flow of development become favorites. There\nis an art to taking an idea, breaking it down, and making progress.\n\nThe longer I am on the path to running code that works \u2013 or getting effective\nhelp back onto the path when it isn\u2019t working \u2013 the better I feel.\n\nOn the flip side, whenever I am doing something that feels like toil, or I\nfeel really stuck, the worse I feel.\n\nThere have been a couple of times when I saw how AI technology could\ndramatically help:\n\n  * I worked with a research team inside X at Google who built models (in the pre-LLM/transformer days) that could help the highly skilled SWEs keep up with the constantly evolving monorepo. This was often very boring work, ripe for a computer to help.\n  * I worked on a project at Shopify that uses LLMs to bridge the complexity of GraphQL for developers wanting to integrate with merchant data. This quickly taught me lessons, such as:\n\n    * It\u2019s easy to show a cool (somewhat contrived) demo\n    * It\u2019s hard to build something great that works at scale in the real world\n    * One LLM isn\u2019t the answer for all use cases\n    * It\u2019s not just quantity... quality data matters\n    * Having a system that can really do well wrt evaluations is vital as you iterate\n\nProjects like these gave me the evidence to see how software engineering is\ngoing to radically change in the future, and pairing AI technology with\ndevelopers will be the driver.\n\n## Meeting the Augment team\n\nI was sold on the opportunity that this AI wave could allow us to help\ndevelopers in new expansive ways. I started to explore, and this exploration\nlead me to chatting with a couple old friends, Luke Wroblewski and Sam Pullara\nwho are building companies at Sutter Hill Ventures, a pretty unique VC firm.\n\nLuke and Sam grinned as I spoke about my desire to build for developers with\nAI, and quickly introduced me to the founders and team behind Augment.\n\nI met Guy Gur-Ari, the co-founder leading the research efforts at Augment. He\nhad already assembled a team of AI researchers and engineers who had many\nyears of expertise with ML and how it can be applied to code. This was\nimportant to me, as I had found that to build something truly great, you need\nthe ability to make changes across the entire stack. You want to be able to\nchange the engine along with the other parts of the car!\n\nIgor Ostrovsky, the other co-founder and pioneer of Augment, also gave me a\nlot of faith that we had the broad technical expertise to pull this off at\nscale. His proven track record with distributed systems as Chief Architect of\nPure Storage, developer focused work at Microsoft, and his deep dive into AI\nas an entrepreneur in residence with SHV was inspiring.\n\nThen I discovered that Scott Dietzen had joined as CEO. I first met Scott at\nthe birth of enterprise Java, where he was CTO at BEA WebLogic, my favorite\napp server of choice.\n\nAs I met the broader team, I had a strong feeling that this was a team with\nthe focus, experience, and skill to take a shot at building the best AI\nplatform and ecosystem for developers.\n\nThe team had gone deep in building foundational technology that is needed to\nsolve the meaty problems that developers have, especially at scale. These\ninclude building a system that:\n\nHas an expert understanding of large codebases\n\nThere are solutions out there that feel like you have access to a system aware\nof core technology. They have a solid understanding of programming languages,\nand popular frameworks.\n\nWhen using Augment, we want you to feel like you are working with the joint\nintuition of your most seasoned engineers at the company, and those with deep\nexpertise on the dependencies that you use.\n\nAny suggestions need to reflect the APIs and coding patterns in your company\u2019s\ncode so your team can use it on your actual day-to-day work.\n\nProduces running code\n\nThe custom AI models and infrastructure are tuned for code and coding use\ncases avoiding frustrating hallucinations and focuses on improving code\nquality... not just productivity.\n\nOperates at the speed of thought\n\nThere were many search engines before Google, but I remember trying it for the\nfirst time, and seeing how the experience was a step change. The quality of\nthe results were next level AND the speed to return them felt different.\n\nWorking with LLMs can be a lil... slow, which massively degrades the\nexperience and can keep knocking you out of flow.\n\nThe team had built a fast inference \u2014 3x faster than competitors \u2014 built on\nstate-of-the-art techniques, including custom GPU kernels, and I felt the\ndifference in the experience.\n\nSupports multiple developers & teams\n\nSoftware development is a team sport. There are so many areas where technology\ncan help scale and improve the use of best practices across a team, help you\nlearn a complex codebase, and get new engineers onboarded faster.\n\nThe scale of computers allow a system to attend to do much more, and they are\navailable 24\u00d77.\n\nI have learned the power of small teams. We have seen with early customers\nthat the shape of teams can change when you deliver the right capabilities. If\nwe can enable smaller teams to do more, and for teams to do more in parallel,\nwe result in better software and happier devs to boot!\n\nIncludes strong IP protections\n\nYour company\u2019s source code is precious. Augment was designed from the first\nline of code for tenant isolation, with an architecture built to protect your\nIP.\n\n## Try Augment\n\nJoining Augment has already been a blast. Moving at startup speed with a great\ncrew all focused on helping developers is a dream come true for me. I feel\nvery fortunate to have the opportunity to go after this problem space with a\nsmall (but growing! Join us?) team.\n\nWe are heads down delivering on our promise, working closely with early access\ncustomers, who have been a key part of our product development thanks to their\nfantastic feedback (thank you!).\n\nWe are furiously working our way to a public product launch that we can\u2019t wait\nto share.\n\nUntil then, if you are interested in kicking the tires early, please sign up\nfor the waitlist!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nTagged With: GenAI, Software Development\n\n## Primary Sidebar\n\n### Twitter\n\nMy Tweets\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n### Follow\n\n### Tags\n\n3d Touch 2016 Active Recall Adaptive Design Agile Amazon Echo Android Android\nDevelopment Apple Application Apps Artificial Intelligence Autocorrect blog\nBots Brain Calendar Career Advice Cloud Computing Coding Cognitive Bias\nCommerce Communication Companies Conference Consciousness Cooking Cricket\nCross Platform Deadline Delivery Design Design Systems Desktop Developer\nAdvocacy Developer Experience Developer Platform Developer Productivity\nDeveloper Relations Developers Developer Tools Development Distributed Teams\nDocumentation DX Ecosystem Education Energy Engineering Engineering Mangement\nEntrepreneurship Exercise Eyes Family Fitness Football Founders Future GenAI\nGender Equality Google Google Developer Google IO Habits Health Hill Climbing\nHR Integrations JavaScript Jobs Jquery Kids Stories Kotlin Language LASIK\nLeadership Learning LLMs Lottery Machine Learning Management Messaging Metrics\nMicro Learning Microservices Microsoft Mobile Mobile App Development Mobile\nApps Mobile Web Moving On NPM Open Source Organization Organization Design\nPair Programming Paren Parenting Path Performance Platform Platform Thinking\nPolitics Product Design Product Development Productivity Product Management\nProduct Metrics Programming Progress Progressive Enhancement Progressive Web\nApp Project Management Psychology Push Notifications pwa QA Rails React\nReactive Remix Remote Working Resilience Ruby on Rails Screentime Self\nImprovement Service Worker Sharing Economy Shipping Shopify Short Story\nSilicon Valley Slack Soccer Software Software Development Spaced Repetition\nSpeaking Startup Steve Jobs Study Teaching Team Building Tech Tech Ecosystems\nTechnical Writing Technology Tools Transportation TV Series Twitter Typescript\nUber UI Unknown User Experience User Testing UX vitals Voice Walmart Web Web\nComponents Web Development Web Extensions Web Frameworks Web Performance Web\nPlatform WWDC Yarn\n\n### Subscribe via Email\n\n### Archives\n\n### Search\n\n### Subscribe\n\nRSS - Posts\n\nThe right thing to do, is the right thing to do.\n\nThe right thing to do, is the right thing to do.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 \u00b7 Log in\n\n", "frontpage": false}
