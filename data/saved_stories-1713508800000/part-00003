View top 5 Roblox sources for new user plays and revenue\n  2. See how new users retain, engage, and monetize by Roblox source\n\n### View your top 5 Roblox sources for new user plays and revenue\n\nWe\u2019ve added new charts that show you the top 5 sources:\n\n  1. For new users with plays\n  2. For 30 day revenue per new user (cumulative)\n\n1594\u00d7336 35 KB\n\nNote: Numbers are illustrative and different for each experience\n\nFor example, based on the charts above:\n\n  1. Home Recommendation drives the most new user plays but lags behind other sources in 30 day revenue per new user.\n  2. This data suggests that you might want to update your thumbnails to attract new users who are more likely to engage and spend in your experience.\n\n### See how new users retain, engage, and monetize by Roblox source\n\nWe\u2019ve added a detailed New Users Funnel table that shows you how new users\nretain, engage, and monetize by Roblox source.\n\n1572\u00d7691 85 KB\n\nNote: Numbers are illustrative and different for each experience\n\nFor example, based on the table above:\n\n  1. Sponsored ads had the lowest 30 day revenue per user due to weak retention and playtime. Consider using our new genre targeting feature 59 to reach users who might be more interested in your experience.\n  2. Friends had the highest 30 day revenue per user. Consider investing in features like player invite prompts 5 to grow this source.\n\nYou can click the Acquisition, Engagement, and Monetization tabs in this table\nto see even more detailed metrics per source. For more details, see our\ndocumentation 170.\n\n### What\u2019s next\n\nWe are exploring ways to help you track external campaigns and sources (e.g.,\ngenerating an unique URL for your experience to track metrics) later this\nyear.\n\nStay tuned for more and let us know if you have any feedback in the comments.\nThank you!\n\n  * #### created\n\n2d\n\n  * #### last reply\n\n1d\n\n  * 21\n\n#### replies\n\n  * 8.7k\n\n#### views\n\n  * 19\n\n#### users\n\n  * 173\n\n#### likes\n\n  * 4\n\n#### links\n\n  * 2\n\n2\n\nOpened 2 days ago\n\nThis topic was automatically opened after 10 minutes.\n\nMathewoliwieer4Modeler\n\n2d\n\nI mean, this is okay... I don\u2019t really know if this will be useful to other\nthan popular experiences right now.\n\nThe BatmanastraIboy\n\n2d\n\nThis detailed breakdown by Roblox source will undoubtedly help us developers\noptimize our strategies. Excited to see the upcoming features like tracking\nexternal campaigns!\n\nDaniel MagyarorszagGameInspectorsBuilder\n\n2d\n\nI\u2019d say this update is cool, since YouTube lets you see the sources of the\nviewers\n\nimage1033\u00d71073 76.8 KB\n\nand it would help us ensure our advertising strategies work well\n\nChasingChasingSpaceProgrammer\n\n2d\n\nIs there any way to better figure out what \u201cOther\u201d is (e.g. using Referer\nheader)?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to really act on it if you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s from but makes a\nconsiderable impact on your game.\n\nJoeyCoderJoeyProgrammer\n\n2d\n\nGreat addition to the analytics! Only thing I\u2019d like to add is the ability for\nus to see this in-game on the engine API side, perhaps information for where a\nplayer joined the game could be added to the Player: GetJoinData() function?\n\n1billybob1Programmer\n\n2d\n\nAfter years and years of poor analytic tracking, to see what Roblox offers now\nin terms of analytics is amazing.\n\nThe jump even from 2018 to now ... absolutely wild.\n\nThank you for focusing on this, keep up the great work.\n\nSharpSeriousProgrammer\n\n2d\n\nThanks for the update but even when we understand more about our audience,\nRoblox is still not allowing for many games to grow.\n\nDespite updating weekly and trying to push HRCVR to the max, we\u2019ve lost 90% of\nour playerbase in a few weeks and impressions went down by the millions\ndespite KPIs above 90%\n\nIntroducing Today\u2019s Picks - A New Curated Sort on Home [Pilot] Announcements\n\n> I\u2019m sorry Roblox but it\u2019s coming to the point where you\u2019re draining new and\n> smaller games so much that it\u2019s impossible to even live on the extremely\n> hard work we put in.

Making conclusions on analytics is\nunderstandably not the easiest, but it helps identifying growth opportunities.\nExamples for this are given as well:\n\nsignal_zzz:\n\n> For example, based on the table above:\n>\n>   1.

Referer header doesn\u2019t work well\nsince a lot of external sites intentionally disable it. It also doesn\u2019t work\nwell with mobile apps.\n\nEDMOneEDMProgrammer\n\n2d\n\nReally amazing job as always! Analytics continues to model how all teams at\nRoblox should be run.\n\nSuper excited for what\u2019s coming next\n\nCrazyCorrsProgrammer\n\nSharpSerious\n\n2d\n\nMight be wrong but it seems you\u2019re having a similar issue to what was posted\nhere: Algorithm is extremely unstable right now 29\n\nMaybe you could add to this topic?\n\nSharpSeriousProgrammer\n\nCrazyCorrs\n\n2d\n\nThank you, done!\n\nI would also appreciate a response @rbxranger7 @signal_zzz\n\nWe\u2019re forced to let go off developers on a daily basis that rely on Roblox as\nan income source and we\u2019re cutting development by 80% as we simply don\u2019t have\nthe funds to continue operations.\n\nbananphaBuilder\n\nSharpSerious\n\n2d\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is happening!\n\nAVeryFancyDoctorGame Designer\n\nThe Batman\n\n2d\n\nI agree, as somebody who develops mostly for RP games, getting information\nlike this is amazing.\n\ntraxy209Builder\n\n2d\n\nThis is great for creators to check their analytics in experiences and for\ngetting the revenue in a specific days.\n\nBMWLux\n\n2d\n\nLove it! Give us everything! I would love to see everything that goes into the\nalgorithm. I am curious, does Roblox Retetnion rather than just normal game\nretention go into the algorithm. Like users returning to roblox?\n\nBMWLux\n\nJoey\n\n1d\n\nI agree 100%! It would be awesome to track data on specific players and we can\nuse a/b testing live in game to create the most optimal experiences.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Roblox Corporation.
