A glyph is a little picture\ninside the font file, and is identified by ID, which is a number from 0 -\n65535. However, there\u2019s a step after character mapping but before\nrasterization: shaping.\n\nFor example, one application of shaping is seen in Arabic text. In Arabic,\neach letter has four different forms, depending on which letters are next to\nit. For example, two letters in their isolated form look like \u0641 and \u064a but as\nsoon as you put them together, they form new shapes and look like \u0641\u064a. This\ntype of modification isn\u2019t possible if characters are naively mapped to glyphs\nand then rasterized directly. Instead, there needs to be a step in the middle\nto modify the glyph forms so the correct thing is rasterized.\n\nThis \u201cmiddle step\u201d is called shaping, and is implemented by three tables\ninside the OpenType font file: GSUB, GPOS, and GDEF. Let\u2019s consider GSUB\nalone.\n\n### GSUB\n\nThe GSUB table, or \u201cglyph substitution\u201d table, is designed to let font authors\nreplace glyphs with other glyphs. It describes a transformation where the\ninput is a sequence of glyphs and the output is a different sequence of\nglyphs. It is made up of a collection of constituent \u201clookup tables,\u201d each of\nwhich has a \u201ctype.\u201d\n\nType 1 (\u201csingle substitution\u201d) provides a map from glyph to glyph. This is\nused for example, when someone enables the \u2018swsh\u2019 feature, the font can\nsubstitute out the ampersand with a fancy ampersand. In that situation, the\nmap would contain a mapping from the regular ampersand to the fancy ampersand\n(possibly in addition to some more additional mappings, too).\n\nType 2 (\u201cmultiple substitution\u201d) provides a map from glyph to sequence-of-\nglyphs. This is used, for example, if diacritic (accent) marks are represented\nas separate glyphs inside the font. The font can replace the \u201c\u00e8\u201d glyph with\nthe \u201ce\" glyph followed by the \u25cc\u0300 glyph (and then the GPOS table later can\nposition the two glyphs physically on top of each other).\n\nType 4 (\u201cligature substitution\u201d) provides a map of sequence-of-glyphs to\nsingle glyph (the opposite of type 2). This is used for ligatures, so if you\nhave a fancy \u201cffi\u201d ligature, you can represent all three of those letters in\nthe same fancy glyph.\n\nType 5 (\u201ccontextual substitution\u201d) is special. It doesn\u2019t do any replacements\ndirectly, but instead maps a sequence of glyphs to a list of other tables that\nshould be applied at specific points in the glyph sequence. So it can say\nthings like \u201cin the glyph sequence \u2018abcde\u2019, apply table #7 at index 2, and\nthen when you\u2019re done with that, apply table #13 at index 4.\u201d Tables #7 and\n#13 can be any of the types above, so you could use this table to say\nsomething like \u201cswap out the \u2018d\u2019 for an \u2018f\u2019, but only if it appears in the\nsequence \u2018abcde\u2019.\u201d This sort of thing is used to implement the \u201ccontextual\nalternates\u201d feature.\n\nThere are also three other types, but they\u2019re not particularly relevant, so\nI\u2019m going to ignore them.\n\nSo, the inputs to the text system are a set of features and an input string of\nglyphs (The characters have already been mapped to glyphs via the \u201ccmap\u201d\ntable). Features are mapped to a set of lookup tables, each of which is of a\ntype listed above. Each of those lookup tables describes a map where the keys\nare sequences of glyphs, so the runtime iterates through the glyph sequence\nuntil it finds a sequence that\u2019s an input to one of the tables. The runtime\nthen performs that glyph replacement according to the rules of the tables, and\ncontinues iterating.\n\n### Turing Complete\n\nSo this is pretty cool, but it turns out that the contextual substitution\nlookup type is really powerful. This is because the table that it references\ncan be itself, which means it can be recursive.\n\nLet\u2019s pretend we have a lookup table named 42 (presumably because it\u2019s the\n42nd lookup table inside the font), and it\u2019s a contextual substitution lookup\ntable. This table maps glyph sequences to tuples of (lookup table to recurse\nto, offset in glyph sequence to recurse). Let\u2019s say we design it with these\ntwo mappings:\n\nTable42 { A A : (Table42, 1); A B : (Table100, 1); }\n\nIf the runtime is operating on a glyph sequence of \u201cAAAAB\u201d, the first two\n\u201cAA\u201ds will match the first rule, so then the system recurses and runs Table42\non the stream \u201cAAAB\u201d. Then these first two \u201cAA\u201ds will match, and so-on. This\nhappens until you get to the end of the string, \u201cAB\u201d matches, and then\nTable100 is run on the string \u201cB\u201d.\n\nThis is \u201ctail recursion,\u201d and can be used to implement all different types of\nloops. Also, each mapping in the table acts as an \u201cif\u201d statement because it\nonly executes if the pattern is matched.\n\nYou can use the glyph stream as memory by reading and writing to it; that is,\nafter all, what the shaping algorithm is designed to do. You can delete a\nglyph by using Type 2 to map it to an empty sequence. You can insert a glyph\nby using Type 2 to map the preceding glyph to a sequence of [itself, the new\nglyph you want to insert]. And, once you\u2019ve inserted a glyph, you can check\nfor its presence by using the \u201cif\u201d statements described above.\n\nSo thats a pretty powerful virtual machine. I think the above is sufficient to\nprove Turing complete-ness.\n\n### Caveat\n\nSo it turns out the example (\u201cTable42\u201d) above doesn\u2019t actually work in\nDirectWrite. This is because, in DirectWrite, inner matches have to be\nentirely contained within outer matches. So when the outer call to Table42\nmatched \u201cAA\u201d, the inner call to Table42 can only match within that specific\n\u201cAA\u201d. This means it\u2019s impossible to, for example, find the first even glyphID\nand move it to the beginning. So, DirectWrite\u2019s implementation isn\u2019t Turing\ncomplete. However, it does work in HarfBuzz and CoreText, so those\nimplementations are Turing complete.\n\nBut even in HarfBuzz and CoreText, there are hard limits on the recursion\ndepth. HarfBuzz sets its limit to 6. Therefore, the above example will only\nwork on strings of length 7 or fewer. HarfBuzz is open source, though, so I\nsimply used a custom build of HarfBuzz which bumps up this limit to 4 billion.\nThis let me recurse to my heart\u2019s content. A limit of 6 is probably a good\nthing; I don\u2019t think users generally expect their text engines to be running\narbitrary computation during layout. But I want to go beyond it.\n\n### DSL\n\nAfter making the above realizations, I decided to try to implement a\nnontrivial algorithm using only the GSUB table in a font. I wanted to try to\nimplement addition. The input glyph stream would be of the form \u201c=1234+5678=\u201d\nand the shaping process would turn that string into \u201c6912\u201d.\n\nWhen thinking about how to do this, I started jotting down some ideas on paper\nfor what the lookup tables should be, and the things I were writing down were\nvery similar to that \u201cTable42\u201d example above. However, writing down tables of\ntypes 1, 2, and 4 was quite cumbersome, because what I really wanted to\ndescribe were things like \u201cmove this glyph to the beginning of the sequence\u201d\nrather than individual insertions or deletions.\n\nI looked at the \u201cfea\u201d language, which is how these lookups are traditionally\nwritten by font designers. However, after reading the parser, it looks like it\ndoesn\u2019t support recursive or mutually-recursive lookups. So, I rolled my own.\n\nSo, I did what any good programmer does in this situation: I invented a new\ndomain-specific language.\n\nThe DSL has two types of statements. The first is a way of giving a set of\nglyphs a name. I wanted to be able to address all of the digits without having\nto write out every individual digit. So, there\u2019s a statement that looks like\nthis:\n\ndigit: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10;\n\nNote that those numbers are glyph IDs, not code points. In my specific font,\nthe \u201c0\u201d character is mapped to glyph 1, \u201c1\u201d is mapped to glyph 2, etc.\n\nThen, you can describe a lookup using the syntax above:\n\ndigitMove { digit digit: (1, digitMove), (1, digitMove2); digit plus: (1,\ndigitMove2); }\n\nThe lookup is named digitMove, and it has two rules inside it. The first rule\nmatches any two digits next to each other, and if they match, it invokes the\nlookup named digitMove (which is the name of the current lookup, so this is\nrecursive) at index 1, and then after that, invokes the lookup named\ndigitMove2 at index 1.\n\nEach of these stanzas gets translated fairly trivially to lookup with type 5.\n\nThese rules are recursive, as above, but they need a terminal form so that the\nrecursion will eventually end. Those are described like this:\n\nflagPayload { digit digit plus digit: flag \\3 \\0 \\1 \\2; }\n\nThis rule is a terminal because there are no parentheses on the right side of\nthe colon. The right side represents a glyph sequence to replace the match\nwith. The values on the right side are either a literal glyph ID, a glyph set\nthat contains exactly one glyph, or a backreference which starts with a\nbackslash. \u201c\\3\u201d means \u201cwhatever glyph was third glyph in the matched\nsequence\u201d. So the rule above would turn the glyph sequence \u201c34+5\u201d into the\nsequence \u201cF534+\u201d. (The flag glyph is read and removed in a later stage of\nprocessing).\n\nTranslating one of these rules to lookups is nontrivial. I tried a few things,\nbut ended up with the following design:\n\nFor each output glyph, right to left:\n\n  * If it\u2019s a backreference, duplicate the glyph it\u2019s referencing, and perform a sequence of swaps to move the new glyph all the way to the right.\n  * If it\u2019s a literal glyph, insert it at the beginning, and perform a sequence of swaps to move it all the way to the right.\n\nThis means we need to have a way to do the following operations:\n\n  * Duplicate. This is a type 4 lookup that maps every glyph to a sequence of two of that glyph.\n  * Swap. This has two pieces: a type 5 lookup that has a rule for every combination of two glyphs, and each rule maps each glyph to a lookup of type 1 which replaces it with the appropriate glyph. This means you need n of these inner (type 1) lookups, allowing you to map any glyph to any other glyph. However, the encoding format allows us to encode each of these inner lookups in constant space in the font, so these inner lookups don\u2019t take that much space. Instead, the outer type 5 lookup takes n^2 space.\n  * Insert a literal. If you implemented this by simply making a type 2 that mapped every glyph to that same glyph + the literal, you would need n^2 space because there would be n of these tables. Instead, you can cut down the size by doing it in two phases: inserting a flag glyph (which is O(n) space using a lookup type 2) and mapping that glyph to any constant value (also O(n) space using a type 1).\n\nAbove, I\u2019m worried about space constraints in the file because pointers in the\nfile are (in general) 2 bytes, meaning the maximum size that anything can be\nis 2^16. If n^2 space is needed, that means n can only be 2^8 = 256, which\nisn\u2019t that big. Most fonts have on the order of 256 glyphs. Therefore, we need\nto reduce the places where we require O(n^2) space as much as possible.\nLookupType 7 helps somewhat, because it allows you to use 32-bit pointers in\non specific place, but it only helps that one place.\n\nMy font only has 14 glyphs in it, so i didn\u2019t end up near any of these limits,\nbut it\u2019s still important to watch out for out-of-bounds problems.\n\nSo, given all that, we can make a parser which builds an AST for the language,\nand we can build an intermediate representation which represents the bytes in\nthe file, and we can make a lowering phase which lowers the AST to the IR.\nThen we can serialize the IR and write out the data to the file.\n\n### Addition\n\nSo, once the language was up and running, I had to actually write a program\nthat represented addition. It works in four phases.\n\nFirst, define some glyphs:\n\ndigit: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; flag: 13; plus: 11; equals: 12; digit0: 1;\n\nThen, parse the string. If the string didn\u2019t match the form \u201c=digits+digits=\u201d\nthen I wanted nothing to happen. You can do this by recursing across the\nstring, and if you find that it matches the pattern, insert a flag, and then\nwhen all the calls return, move the flag leftward.\n\nparse { equals digit: (1, parseLeft), (0, afterParse); }\n\nparseLeft { digit digit: (1, parseLeft), (0, moveFlagAcrossDigit); digit plus\ndigit: (2, parseRight), (0, moveFlagAcrossPlus); }\n\nparseRight { digit digit: (1, parseRight), (0, moveFlagAcrossDigit); digit\nequals: flag \\0 \\1; }\n\nmoveFlagAcrossDigit { digit flag digit: \\1 \\0 \\2; }\n\nmoveFlagAcrossPlus { digit plus flag digit: \\2 \\0 \\1 \\3; }\n\nafterParse { equals flag: (0, removeFlag), (0, startDigitMove); }\n\nremoveFlag { equals flag: \\0; }\n\nThe next step is to pair up the glyphs. For example, this would turn\n\u201c1234+5678\u201d into \u201c15263748+\u201d.\n\nstartDigitMove { equals digit: (1, digitMove), (1, startPhase2), (0,\nremoveEquals); }\n\nremoveEquals { equals digit: \\1; }\n\ndigitMove { digit digit: (1, digitMove), (1, digitMove2); digit plus: (1,\ndigitMove2); }\n\ndigitMove2 { digit digit: (1, digitMove2), (0, swapDigits); digit plus digit:\n(2, digitMove2), (0, digitMove3); digit plus equals: digit0 \\0 \\1 \\2; plus\ndigit: (1, digitMove2), (0, swapPlusDigit); plus equals: digit0 \\0 \\1; digit\nequals: \\0 \\1; }\n\nswapDigits { digit digit: \\1 \\0; }\n\ndigitMove3 { digit plus digit: \\2 \\0 \\1; }\n\nswapPlusDigit { plus digit: \\1 \\0; }\n\nThe next step is to see if there were any glyphs left over on the right side\nthat didn\u2019t get moved. This happens if the right side is longer than the left\nside. For example, if the input string is \u201c12+3456\u201d we now would have\n\u201c1526+34\u201d. We want to turn this into \u201c03041526\u201d\n\nstartPhase2 { digit digit: (0, phase2), (0, beginPhase3); }\n\nphase2 { digit digit: (0, phase2Move), (0, checkPayload); }\n\nphase2Move { digit digit digit digit: (2, phase2Move), (0, movePayload); digit\ndigit plus equals: \\0 \\1 \\2 \\3; digit digit plus digit: (3, payload), (0,\nflagPayload); }\n\npayload { digit digit: (1, payload), (0, swapDigits); digit equals: \\0 \\1; }\n\nflagPayload { digit digit plus digit: flag \\3 \\0 \\1 \\2; }\n\nmovePayload { digit digit flag digit: \\2 \\3 \\0 \\1; }\n\ncheckPayload { flag digit digit digit: (0, rearrangePayload), (0, phase2); }\n\nrearrangePayload { flag digit digit digit: digit0 \\1 \\2 \\3; }\n\nThe last step is to actually perform the addition. This works like a ripple\ncarry adder. We want to take the glyphs two-at-a-time, and add them, and\nproduce a carry. Then the next pair of glyphs will add, and include the carry.\nWe start the process by introducing a carry = 0.\n\nbeginPhase3 { digit digit: (0, phase3), (0, removeZero); }\n\nphase3 { digit digit digit digit: (2, phase3), (0, addPair); digit digit plus\nequals: (0, insertCarry), (0, addPair); }\n\ninsertCarry { digit digit plus equals: \\0 \\1 digit0; }\n\nremoveZero { digit0 digit: (1, removeZero), (0, removeSingleZero); }\n\nremoveSingleZero { digit0 digit: \\1; }\n\naddPair { 1 1 1: 1 1; 1 1 2: 1 2; 1 2 1: 1 2; 1 2 2: 1 3; 1 3 1: 1 3; 1 3 2: 1\n4; ... more here }\n\n### HarfBuzz\n\nSo I\u2019m doing this whole thing using the HarfBuzz shaper, as described above.\nThis is because it\u2019s open source, so I can find where I\u2019m hitting limits and\nincrease the limits. It turned out that I not only had to increase the\nHB_MAX_NESTING_LEVEL to 4294967294, but I also was running into more limits. I\nended up just taking all the limits in hb-buffer.hh, hb-machinery.hh, and hb-\not-layout-common.hh and increasing them by a factor of 10.\n\nThere\u2019s one more piece that was necessary to get it to work. Inside\napply_lookup() in hb-ot-layout-gsubgpos.hh, there\u2019s a section if (end <= int\n(match_positions[idx])). It looks to me like this section is detecting if a\nrecursive call caused the glyph sequence to get shorter than the size of the\nmatch. Inside this block, it says /* There can't be any further changes. */\nbreak; which seems to stop the recursion (which seems incorrect to me, but I\u2019m\nnot a HarfBuzz developer, so I could be wrong). In order to get this whole\nsystem to work, I had to comment out the \u201cbreak\u201d statement.\n\nSo that\u2019s it! After doing that, the system works, and the font correctly adds\nnumbers. The font has 75 shaping rules and is 32KB large.\n\nThe glyph paths (contours) were taken from from the Retroscape font.\n\nFont file download\n\nPosted by\n\nLitherum at\n\n10:26 PM\n\n#### 69 comments:\n\n  1.

I felt there was no hope for my health and I was\nto try the Protocol, thinking it wouldn\u2019t work because I have visited so many\nhospitals with the same result.
