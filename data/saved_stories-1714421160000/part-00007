T. Max\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nBerman, through his firm, Metro Loft Management, has added some five thousand\nunits to New York City\u2019s housing stock. His company has just announced its\nlargest conversion yet: Pfizer\u2019s former headquarters, on East Forty-second\nStreet, will be refashioned to house thirteen hundred apartments.Photo\nillustration by Josh Cochran; Source photograph by Klaus Vedfelt / Getty\n\nThere are about a thousand real-estate developers in New York City. Nathan\nBerman is one of them, and he\u2019s become rich doing it. But, he told me\nrecently, \u201cI never built a building from scratch, and never wanted to.\u201d\nInstead, Berman, who is sixty-four, specializes in taking existing structures\nand converting them into apartments, a useful trick in a city that\u2019s always\nstarved for housing\u2014and newly wary of the five-day-a-week office routine. In\n2017, he converted 443 Greenwich Street, a former warehouse and book bindery\nin Tribeca, built in 1883, into a luxury condo; among the celebrities who now\nown apartments there are Harry Styles and Jake Gyllenhaal. (The building was\ndesigned to be \u201cpaparazzi-proof,\u201d so it features an underground parking area\nwith a valet.) It\u2019s not much of a feat, though, to redo an industrial space\nthat has a rudimentary interior. Berman is more excited by the transformation\nof huge, obsolete office towers into warrens of one- and two-bedroom\napartments. He compares the effort to extract as much residential rental space\nas possible out of such buildings to solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube.\n\nSince 1997, Berman, through his firm, Metro Loft Management, has turned eight\nManhattan office towers into rental-apartment complexes, adding some five\nthousand units to the city\u2019s housing stock. His company has just signed a\ncontract for the largest conversion yet in the United States: Pfizer\u2019s former\nheadquarters, on East Forty-second Street, will be refashioned to house about\nfifteen hundred apartments. Berman has no patience for nostalgia. \u201cYou\u2019re\ntearing down something that simply doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d he explained.\nAlthough Metro Loft has offices at 40 Wall Street, Berman often works at home\nhimself, on the Upper East Side. He happily spends hours poring over\nblueprints, dividing former fields of cubicles into small but clever\nresidences and reconceiving onetime copy-machine nooks as mini laundry rooms\nor skinny kitchens. All his apartments are market-rate properties, so what he\ncreates is \u00e9lite but ordinary, luxurious but cramped, permanent but marginal.\nAvinash Malhotra, an architect who has done several conversions with Berman,\nnoted that a single office tower can be carved up into hundreds of little\nunits, as in a hotel. \u201cHe is not making housing for the homeless,\u201d Malhotra\nsaid. \u201cBut I often joke among my employees that what we do is slums for the\nrich.\u201d\n\nOne day in December, I went to the financial district and joined Berman in the\nstark white lobby of 55 Broad Street, a thirty-story former office tower that\nwas built in 1967 by Emery Roth & Sons. Berman has started converting it into\nfive hundred and seventy-one apartments, many of them studios aimed at\nprofessionals just out of college. Scaffolding surrounded the bottom of the\ntower, imprisoning a Starbucks by the entrance. Berman dresses to understated\neffect. He wore a quiet-luxury ensemble\u2014unzipped Brunello Cucinelli vest, Loro\nPiana sweater, John Lobb shoes\u2014and carried nothing in his hands but his phone.\n\nHe was overhauling 55 Broad Street under complicated conditions: it still had\noffice tenants inside. The day we visited, five of the floors were still\noccupied by companies that had not yet left. (One, a property-management\noutfit called Solstice Residential Group, even sued to stay, but ultimately\nsettled and moved nearby.) Every so often, an office worker rushed through the\nlobby, looking as lonely as a ghost. The entrance was renovated twenty years\nago by the building\u2019s original owners\u2014the Rudin family, a New York real-estate\npowerhouse\u2014and featured a revolving door, white marble walls, harsh Kubrickian\nlighting, and a long security credenza. Berman said that he would put in a\nhinged door, lower the lighting, cover the walls with wood panelling, add a\nfireplace and an inviting couch or two, and install wide stairs that flowed\ndown to amenity rooms on the floor below. \u201cWalking into the building will seem\nlike walking into a lounge that people are hanging out in,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd\nyou just happen to be one of the people that lives here.\u201d\n\nAmong white-collar workers, the covid-19 pandemic led to a profound shift:\neven when it became safe to return to the office, many employees preferred to\nwork remotely. Nationwide, offices are only about fifty per cent full. Since\n2019, according to a recent academic study, downtown street foot traffic has\nfallen by an average of twenty-six per cent in America\u2019s fifty-two biggest\ncities. Urban theorists describe a phenomenon called the \u201cdoom loop\u201d: once\nworkers stop filling up downtown offices, the stores and restaurants that\nserve them close, which in turn makes the area even emptier. And who wants to\nwork somewhere with no services? In St. Louis, whole swaths of the downtown\nbusiness district are vacant. Not long ago, the A.T. & T. Tower, one of the\ncity\u2019s marquee properties, which was sold for two hundred and five million\ndollars in 2006, was off-loaded for $3.6 million.\n\nIn New York, the rebound has been stronger. On Wall Street, where numerous\nexecutives have expressed sharp impatience with remote work\u2014David Solomon, the\nC.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, has called it an \u201caberration\u201d that undercuts the\ncompany\u2019s \u201ccollaborative apprenticeship culture\u201d\u2014foot traffic has returned to\neighty per cent of its pre-pandemic level. But on Mondays and Fridays many\nManhattan towers become as sparsely populated as an Edward Hopper painting.\nSome company accountants have started to see the rental of large office\nspaces\u2014which in New York can cost more than three hundred dollars per square\nfoot\u2014as a colossal waste. In lower Manhattan, major renters such as Spotify\nand Meta have begun shrinking their footprints, vacating entire floors that\nonce bustled with employees. For the past three years, about twenty-two per\ncent of office space in New York has gone unrented\u2014that\u2019s a hundred million\nvacant square feet, the equivalent of nearly thirty-five Empire State\nBuildings. For the owners of half-empty towers, it\u2019s become increasingly\napparent that a new financial strategy is needed.\n\nBerman has helped show desperate office-tower owners a way out. Although fewer\npeople may want to work in Manhattan, more than enough still want to live\nthere. The over-all vacancy rate for apartments in the city is now 1.4 per\ncent\u2014the tightest market in fifty years. The reasons that the city\u2019s work and\nresidential fortunes have not moved in step are various. \u201cThere is only one\nNew York,\u201d Berman told me. \u201cCulture, diversity, business, technology,\nmedicine, education\u2014all in one small island.\u201d New York remains a place where\nmany ambitious young people go to start their careers, if not to stay, and\nthis demographic is ideal for the hotel-style conversions for which office\ntowers are most suitable. Moreover, Berman said, \u201cyoung people are social\u2014they\ndon\u2019t want to sit in the middle of a forest on a Zoom call.\u201d\n\nConverting offices into apartments won\u2019t be a panacea for New York\u2019s real-\nestate titans: there is simply too much square footage that is going unused,\nand this will be a problem as long as companies continue switching to smaller\npremises. Berman told me, \u201cIf we ultimately absorb twenty per cent of the\noffice space, that would be optimistic.\u201d But, he added, conversions will\nenergize neighborhoods that otherwise would be among the worst hit, like the\nfinancial district. There, Berman foresees apartments replacing half the empty\noffices.\n\nThe tower at 55 Broad Street has spent most of its existence as an unlovable\nbuilding in an unlivable neighborhood. In the Art Deco era, the architectural\nfirm founded by Emery Roth was an innovator\u2014it designed the San Remo and the\nBeresford apartment buildings, on Central Park West\u2014but by the late nineteen-\nsixties it was known for maximizing rentable office space above all else. At\n55 Broad, which is right around the corner from the Stock Exchange, two\nadjoining ten-story structures came down to make way for a much taller new\nbuilding. It was a time of rapid growth on Wall Street\u2014between 1958 and 1973,\nthe amount of office space downtown doubled. The design ethos was \u201cdo your own\nthing.\u201d \u201cThis is not the Renaissance, or an age of uniform standards of\nbeautiful buildings,\u201d a member of the City Planning Commission explained to\nthe Times in 1973. \u201cNo one agrees on anything.\u201d\n\nThe result at 55 Broad was a dark curtain-wall tower with windows and brown\npanels spaced between thick steel pinstripes. Deep rectangular floors were set\nback every ten stories, creating a three-tiered wedding cake. Two renovations\nfollowed over the decades, but the building remained what it had always been:\na dull stack of boxes.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nThrowing Shade Through Crosswords\n\nShortly after the Rudins built the tower, they attracted as its anchor tenant\nGoldman Sachs, which was then in a period of wild ascent. Four years after the\nbuilding opened, a Times reporter dropped by Goldman and excitedly described\nan \u201cassemblage of young men with longish haircuts and bright colored shirts\u201d\non a trading floor that \u201crips with action.\u201d Goldman was so successful that it\neventually built its own building, two blocks south, leaving 55 Broad half\nempty. In 1985, Drexel Burnham Lambert, the firm that pioneered the junk bond,\nmoved in. Within five years, it had fallen under indictment and gone bankrupt,\nforcing the Rudins to scramble again. The family spent millions to make 55\nBroad into a state-of-the-art tech hub, borrowing strategies from \u201cBeing\nDigital,\u201d by the nineties tech guru Nicholas Negroponte. Broadband was\ninstalled on every floor, and for a time the mid-century structure was \u201cone of\nthe most wired in the world,\u201d according to Forbes. This incarnation lasted\nuntil the dot-com bust of 2000, when many of 55 Broad\u2019s tenants went under or\nmoved out. In the next decade, terabytes replaced gigabytes, and the number of\nservers that a cutting-edge tech firm needed could have taken up an entire\nwarehouse. In 2014, plans were leaked for a proposed fifty-three-story\nreplacement at 55 Broad, but it was never built. A lot of time and money is\nrequired to safely dismantle a thirty-story tower on a narrow, busy street.\n\nSix years later, the pandemic hollowed out the city, particularly the business\ndistricts. By July, 2023, the Rudins had concluded that 55 Broad\u2014then only\nsixty per cent rented\u2014had no future as an office tower. They sold most of\ntheir interest in the building to Berman, keeping a small part so they could\nobserve how he handled conversions. (Silverstein Properties, which rebuilt the\nWorld Trade Center, also became a partner in the project.) The decision to\nconvert to residential was a hard one for the Rudins. \u201cWe don\u2019t like selling\nour buildings,\u201d Bill Rudin, one of the chairs of the family\u2019s company, told\nme. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a mantra for us.\u201d The opportunity to learn from Berman was\na big factor: \u201cWe wanted to see the maestro, like a front-row seat to see\nLeonard Bernstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me read to you from a recently fictionalized version of the procedure . .\n. \u201d\n\nCartoon by P. C. Vey\n\nLink copied\n\nThe sale price for 55 Broad was $172.5 million. The construction loan was set\nat two hundred and twenty million dollars. The total cost of the\nproject\u2014nearly four hundred million dollars\u2014was considerable, but replacing\nthe office tower with a new building, Berman told me, would have cost \u201cwell\nover six hundred million.\u201d (Upgrading it in the hope of attracting new office\ntenants, according to Berman, would have cost roughly eighty million dollars.)\nAnd, because of zoning reforms, no new building would be allowed to overwhelm\na Manhattan street the way the hulking towers of the postwar period did. A\ndeveloper who constructed a tower the same height as 55 Broad would likely\nhave to sacrifice twenty per cent of the rentable space.\n\nEarly in the conversion process, Berman\u2019s construction team removed the\nfluorescent-tube lighting and the dropped PVC ceilings. Then workers knocked\ndown the drywall that had once delineated corner offices, windowless offices,\nrest rooms, mop closets. \u201cWe do a very thorough gut renovation,\u201d Berman told\nme. \u201cWe literally take everything out.\u201d At 55 Broad, the result was nearly\nfour hundred thousand square feet of raw space, with a potential to generate\nmore than thirty million dollars in rental income annually. But Berman still\nhad a major puzzle to solve: If no one wanted to work in a glum, out-of-date\nbuilding, why would anyone want to live there?\n\nIn the lobby at 55 Broad, Berman pressed the Up button. \u201cThis building is way\nover-elevatored,\u201d he said. Soon, five elevators would be torn out. Apartment\nbuildings, he explained, generally need fewer than half the elevators that\noffice buildings do. \u201cResidents don\u2019t mind waiting twenty seconds more for the\nelevator,\u201d he said.\n\nA visit to the sixth floor offered a bleak sight\u2014it was an empty, dark space\nhalf the size of a football field, interrupted only by steel support beams and\nrusted copper waste pipes. The floor was unsealed concrete, and transverse\nbeams along the ceiling were coated with intumescent paint, a fire-resistant\ncovering that looks like bubbling-hot marshmallow. When I stood at the center\nof the building, the windows were so far away that they looked almost like\nportholes.\n\nBerman gave me a detailed tour of the thirteenth floor. In his business, a\ncrucial metric for turning a profit is the time lag between borrowing\nconstruction money and renting out units. So he works fast. Just four months\nhad passed since Berman, Silverstein, and Rudin had closed their deal, but the\nthirteenth floor already felt like part of a new apartment complex. Workers\nwere measuring, drilling, staple-gunning. Metal track had been laid down where\nnew walls would go, and a few drywall panels had already been installed\u2014they\nwere covered in a playful-looking purple glaze, to make them resistant to\nmold. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more expensive,\u201d Berman said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want any\nissues down the road.\u201d On one piece of drywall, \u201cApt. 10\u201d was scratched in\npen. There was even a handsome tub in a bathroom without walls, like a guest\nwho\u2019d arrived too early for a party.\n\nRenters are now used to the layouts of chain hotels, where there\u2019s one window\nby the bed, so Berman\u2019s bathrooms and kitchens didn\u2019t need to be sunny, and\nthe kitchens could have a minimal footprint. \u201cOur demographic doesn\u2019t cook,\u201d\nhe said. He referred to the other rooms without windows as \u201chome offices.\u201d Now\nthat working from home was common, I observed, such spaces were likely to get\na lot of use. He smiled, then said that many would wind up as bedrooms. This\nis technically forbidden, because in New York City every bedroom must have a\nwindow that can be opened, but it\u2019s a widespread practice nonetheless. Berman\nlaid out a rental scenario: \u201cImagine two or three Goldman Sachs associates who\ncame to New York just after college and want a little bit more spending\nmoney.\u201d (In real-estate ads, a one-bedroom with a windowless office is often\ncalled a \u201cconvertible two-bedroom.\u201d)\n\nBerman told me that he could repurpose any office building to residential if\nthe sale price was right. But he acknowledged that 55 Broad posed special\nchallenges. Until the mid-twenty-tens, office-tower conversions in Manhattan\nmostly involved prewar buildings. These had narrow, smaller floors that\ndivided easily into apartments, and because they were built before air-\nconditioning they often had courtyards or ventilation shafts. You therefore\ndidn\u2019t have to create odd layouts to give bedrooms some sun. (Natural light\ntends to peter out about thirty feet into a building\u2019s interior.) Prewar\nbuildings were also full of setbacks, which could become private terraces, and\nthey had oak-panelled elevators that felt homey. I had recently visited the\nfirst such building to undergo a major office-to-residence conversion in the\nfinancial district, 55 Liberty Street, which long served as the headquarters\nof Sinclair Oil Corporation. An architect named Joseph Pell Lombardi had\nconverted the building in 1980. I checked out the apartment of one of the\nfirst purchasers, on the twenty-third floor. The view was magnificent in three\ndirections, the vista broken only by the gargoyles that the original\narchitect, Henry Ives Cobb, had mounted on the Gothic Revival fa\u00e7ade. Looking\ndown from one window, I saw the august Federal Reserve Bank, with its vaults\nfull of gold bars. The view matched the fantasy we all have of living in New\nYork. As the architect Robert A. M. Stern told the Times in 1996, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t\nwant to live in a skyscraper? Everybody in movies lives in apartments on the\ntop of Manhattan.\u201d\n\nBut few towers like 55 Liberty remain available for conversion in the\nfinancial district. What are left are postwar structures\u2014many with deep, dark\ninteriors, low ceilings, and scant visual appeal. Berman did what he could to\nadd comfort to such buildings while holding on to his wallet. He could\nrepurpose extra elevator shafts as garbage chutes, for example. In one\nbuilding, he turned elevator-shaft spaces into foyers for a line of\napartments.\n\nThe double-height mechanical floor of 55 Broad, which once contained giant\nheating and cooling systems, would be turned into two floors of apartments.\nResidents would be provided with compact HVAC units under certain windows, as\nin a motel. These units required much less space than the old systems, and\nwere far more energy-efficient. Berman noted that 55 Broad would be the first\nall-electric, emission-free apartment building in Manhattan. This was not only\nenvironmentally beneficial; it also saved him the cost of inserting thousands\nof feet of piping into concrete floors. It was but one example of how Berman\u2019s\nmonetary interest and the common good conveniently aligned. We looked out a\nwindow at an adjacent nondescript office building, and he saw prey. \u201cThat\u2019s\ngoing to be that way for maybe three to five more years,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThat\nbuilding will be converted, too.\u201d\n\nAdaptive reuse is a form of recycling, a point that Berman often makes.\nAccording to a recent paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research,\nconverting an out-of-date office building into an apartment complex can\nincrease its energy efficiency by as much as eighty per cent. (In a\nresidential building, not everyone blasts the air-conditioning 24/7.)\nAccording to a report by the Arup Group, an engineering firm, converting a\nManhattan office tower releases, on average, less than half the carbon that\nbuilding one from scratch does.\n\nAs expensive as these projects may seem, the cheaper cost of repurposing an\nold building can allow rental prices to be set lower than they would be in a\nnew one. Berman estimated the minimum monthly rent for a studio apartment in a\nnew lower-Manhattan building at well over four thousand dollars, whereas a\ncomparable apartment in 55 Broad will go for about thirty-five hundred.\nAlthough this is a considerable sum for one person, it\u2019s not especially\nexpensive by Manhattan standards, and, as Berman acknowledged, many of his\nunits will end up being shared.\n\nHe stressed to me that he is not particularly interested in what goes on\ninside the apartments, or in what the tenant experience is like. \u201cA renter is\nnot a condominium owner,\u201d he told me several times. He isn\u2019t trying to re-\ncreate 443 Greenwich Street, his celebrity-friendly condo development, with\nits wine cellar and tiled hammam. \u201cOur profile is a young person,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMaybe twenty-four, twenty-five, who stays one or two years, maybe three.\nThey\u2019re not committing.\u201d His clients are in the city-hopping phase of life: \u201c\n\u2018O.K., next year, the year is up and I\u2019m going because I need to be in Boston,\nor I need to be in Chicago, or I\u2019m going to San Francisco.\u2019 \u201d Berman had\nconsidered improving 55 Broad\u2019s dated fa\u00e7ade, but decided that it was money\npoorly spent. \u201cRenters pay less attention to these things,\u201d he said.\n\nNew York renters don\u2019t have much choice, anyway. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had this kind of\nimbalance between demand and supply before,\u201d Berman said, with the pleasure of\na person who likes his odds. The vacancy rate in the five or so buildings that\nhe currently owns is about one and a half per cent. He estimated that all the\nunits at 55 Broad would be rented within six months of going on the market.\n\nA few of Berman\u2019s redevelopment schemes have been more architecturally\nadventurous. In 2017, he worked with Avinash Malhotra to convert 180 Water\nStreet, also in the financial district. The building, like 55 Broad, was a\nthick rectangular slab designed by Emery Roth & Sons, and had interior spaces\nmore than seventy feet long. Berman could have rented out these extra-long\napartments as they were, but instead he decided to remove the core of the\nbuilding, where mechanical equipment was taking up space, thereby creating a\ncourtyard and cutting the apartment layouts down to normal length. Though such\na restructuring had never been tried before, he took the risk, at a cost of\nseveral million dollars. The result gave tenants more light, he said, but that\nwas incidental. New York City law permitted him to add the removed square\nfootage to the top of the building\u2014he gained four floors and a roof with a\npool. \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t have done that, I wouldn\u2019t have had cost-efficient\nunits,\u201d he said.\n\nThe architects for 55 Broad are John Cetra and his spouse and professional\npartner, Nancy J. Ruddy. They are well respected in the industry, but they are\nnot starchitects, a type that Berman has no time for. \u201cA young-professional\nrenter isn\u2019t going to pay me more money because my building was designed by\nNorman Foster,\u201d he told me. One day, Cetra and Ruddy met me at 55 Broad. Cetra\ndescribed the back-and-forth that he and Berman have on their projects. (55\nBroad is their sixth.) Berman sketches out a plan first, then passes it to\nCetra. \u201cHe wants to make it more efficient,\u201d Cetra said. \u201cI want to make it a\nlittle better. \u2018Nathan, let\u2019s give this foyer a bit more room.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhereas Berman focusses on the architect Cass Gilbert\u2019s definition of the\nskyscraper as a \u201cmachine that makes the land pay,\u201d Cetra and Ruddy emphasize\npleasure. Cetra showed me his floor plan for 55 Broad: apartments curled\naround apartments like frolicsome seals. He explained that he and Ruddy always\nsought the \u201cwow factor,\u201d adding, \u201cIdeally, in as many apartments as you can,\nwhen you open the door you see light and you walk toward light.\u201d Shiny wood\nfloors would have heightened this effect, but, Cetra noted a bit sheepishly,\nthe floors at 55 Broad would be covered in something called \u201cvinyl plank\nflooring.\u201d Wood scuffs too easily in a building where people are constantly\nmoving in and out, and, Cetra said, vinyl flooring was getting better.\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to create patterns that don\u2019t repeat,\u201d he said.\n\nRuddy said that it was fun to fit apartment layouts into the constraints set\nby an office tower\u2019s shape\u2014each unit had \u201cthe intricacy of a watch.\u201d She\nrecounted a notable success for which they\u2019d won an award. In 2014, while\nconverting the former Flatotel, on Fifty-second Street, into condos, they had\nreconfigured an old loading dock\u2014a concrete area where trucks parked and\ndumpsters were stored\u2014into a new mid-block entrance. \u201cWe created this sort of\nmagical lobby out of it,\u201d Ruddy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone had ever converted\na loading dock before.\u201d\n\nCetra jabbed at his floor plan for 55 Broad to amplify the point: \u201cIf this\nwere a new building, every one-bedroom would be exactly the same. But look\nhere. This is a one-bedroom, that\u2019s a studio, that\u2019s a one-bedroom studio, and\nevery one has different proportions.\u201d (A resident of 20 Broad Street, an\nearlier project that Cetra and Ruddy developed with Berman, complained to\nBloomberg News last year about her studio: \u201cIt was a very awkward space. It\nwasn\u2019t square, it wasn\u2019t a rectangle, it had all kinds of bizarre edges and\nweird corners.\u201d)\n\nOne feature would be standard at 55 Broad: a washer and dryer. \u201cPeople do\ntheir laundry in their pajamas or their underwear while they\u2019re watching\ntelevision,\u201d Ruddy explained. In the basement, public space that might\notherwise be devoted to a large communal laundry room would be aimed at\nhelping tenants meet one another. Small apartments make people want amenities,\nand amenities make people accept small apartments. The new generation expects\npost-college life to resemble college. \u201cWe\u2019re in an amenities war,\u201d Ruddy\nsaid. All the buildings converted in the financial district are full of co-\nworking spaces, gyms, and plush couches.\n\nOne of Cetra and Ruddy\u2019s signature moves, they told me, is to adorn a public\nspace with a modular shelving unit that contains small sculptures and ceramics\nthat \u201cfeel like they could have been picked up on a trip overseas.\u201d The\narchitects also include a pile of art books\u2014\u201cJazzlife,\u201d \u201cHelmut Newton: Work,\u201d\na book of Ai Weiwei\u2019s installations. I objected that these seemed like the\nsorts of books people never actually read, but they disagreed. Tenants did\npull them down. In fact, Cetra and Ruddy told me, the books at AVA DoBro, a\nnew apartment building in downtown Brooklyn that they had designed, once\ndisappeared entirely. \u201cIt turned out it was a construction worker who had\ngrown up without books,\u201d Ruddy said. \u201cSo I replaced them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re good books,\u201d Cetra added.\n\n\u201cFor the last time\u2014because it\u2019s relaxing and romantic!\u201d\n\nCartoon by Sofia Warren\n\nLink copied\n\nWe went to 55 Broad\u2019s roof, where we stood in front of a long, empty concrete\npit. Ruddy pulled out an iPad to show me a rendering of a future pool: eleven\nby forty-five feet, set off by a dozen deck chairs facing east and a tasteful\nborder of shrubs to increase, as Ruddy said, \u201cconnectivity with nature.\u201d There\nwas what looked to me like a pool house but turned out to be \u201can indoor-\noutdoor working space.\u201d\n\nThe 55 Broad tower is four hundred feet tall, but in the financial district\nthat makes it midsize. I pointed out that remnant workers in the neighboring\ntowers could easily peek out their office windows and observe whatever action\nwas ripping on 55 Broad\u2019s rooftop. Cetra said, \u201cThat\u2019s part of the fun!\u201d\n\nIn the late seventies, my father and mother, an Upper West Side couple,\nseparated. My father, a corporate lawyer, had long worked at 77 Water Street,\na steel-and-glass-curtain edifice, designed by Emery Roth, that still\nfunctions as an office building. A few years later, he moved into a nearby\none-bedroom apartment, in one of the first converted office towers. It was a\nprewar building, and the impressive lobby made you feel as though you were\nheading for an appointment with Mr. Morgan. For my father, the short walk to\nwork, after a professional lifetime of taking the 2 or 3 train up and down\nManhattan\u2019s spine, was a pleasure. The apartment had a kitchen he didn\u2019t use,\nand it was on a high floor. On the nights I stayed with him, we would look out\nat neighboring towers\u2019 brightly illuminated interiors, the cleaners slowly\nadvancing through each floor, emptying the wastebaskets. He told me that he\nliked the feeling of being a lumberjack going to sleep in the middle of his\nforest.\n\nBack then, there were no restaurants or stores open after business hours, not\neven a Blimpie. Joseph Pell Lombardi\u2019s son, Michael, who grew up at 55 Liberty\nStreet\u2014the building next to the Federal Reserve\u2014also remembers the streets\nbeing empty at night, with guards moving pallets of gold bars. \u201cIt all seemed\nincredibly casual,\u201d Michael remembered. \u201cThere was no one around, only me, a\nkid, imagining how easy it would be just to take one of them.\u201d\n\nCensus figures from 1970 show that just eight hundred and thirty-three people\nlived south of Chambers Street. By the time I began visiting my father\u2019s\nplace, there were more\u2014but not many. \u201cThe jury is still out,\u201d Henry Robbins,\nan expert on real-estate trends, told the Times in 1996, in an article about\nliving in the financial district. \u201cThe area dies at night. It needs a\nneighborhood, a community.\u201d\n\nThanks in part to Berman, the financial district now has enough population\ndensity to feel like a proper New York neighborhood. His office at 40 Wall\nStreet is on the seventeenth floor, and he can see five of his converted\ntowers out the window. Within just a few blocks of 55 Broad, he has turned 20\nExchange Place, 63 Wall Street, 67 Wall Street, 180 Water Street, and 20 Broad\nStreet into apartment buildings. He is currently working on 25 Water Street,\nthe former headquarters of J. P. Morgan, which, after the Pfizer building,\nwill be the second-largest conversion to date in the United States, with Cetra\nand Ruddy helping him design thirteen hundred units. Crain\u2019s New York Business\nhas called Berman \u201cthe king of FiDi.\u201d\n\nHe enjoys his stature as a local potentate. He began his conversion business\nin the late nineties, after receiving an eighty-thousand-dollar loan from his\nfather-in-law. For a time, Berman was an outlier as a developer, focussing on\na market that others found too small or insufficiently profitable. Now he is\nturning away projects. David Marks, the executive at Silverstein Properties\nwho is developing 55 Broad Street with Berman, said, \u201cFor many years\u2014and I\u2019m\nquoting Nathan\u2014he was the quirky monster that no one really understood, and\nnow he\u2019s the prettiest girl on the dance floor and everyone wants a dance with\nhim.\u201d Berman can decide almost instantly\u2014just by knowing the age and the\nlocation of a building and by glancing at Google Earth\u2014if the place is ripe\nfor conversion. \u201cIf the price per pound is right, I say, \u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 \u201d he\nsaid.\n\nBerman, who was born in Ukraine and came to New York at the age of fourteen,\nis the child of a Holocaust survivor, and the niche he occupies in the city\u2019s\nreal-estate ecology makes sense for an immigrant with a mistrust of\ngovernment. He focusses only on buildings built before certain years\u20141977\nbelow Murray Street, and 1961 for the rest of Manhattan\u2014because they can be\nconverted without special variances. (Conversions have long been restricted in\nManhattan because sudden population surges in residential neighborhoods can\ncrowd schools and overwhelm public transport.) \u201cLife is short,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want to wait two or three years for rezoning.\u201d A current zoning-change\nproposal, which Mayor Eric Adams supports, would allow any building in New\nYork built before 1990 to be converted. It would add to the pool of potential\napartments nearly as much office space as there is in all of Philadelphia.\nBerman hopes that the zoning change will become law by the end of the year.\n\nAfter we left 55 Broad, Berman took me on a tour of two of his other\nproperties. We started down the street, at 20 Broad, once a part of the Stock\nExchange. We briefly visited an apartment, but the showpiece was the sub-lobby\nlevel. There was a commercial-size gym replete with punching bags, elliptical\ntrainers, free-weight racks, and rows of treadmills. Another room held pool\ntables, and a third was a library graced with one of Cetra and Ruddy\u2019s modular\nshelving units. Nobody seemed older than thirty-five. Down the hall was a\nvault with heavy iron bars where bonds had once been stored. Rather than pull\nthe huge structure out, Cetra and Ruddy had set up a co-working space in it.\n(\u201cTenants sometimes play poker there now.\u201d) As we left, Berman took the\nmassive door and swung it on its massive hinges, eager to show me that it\nstill worked.\n\nWe walked down Beaver and Pearl Streets to 180 Water Street, the building from\nwhich Berman had removed the core. At the entrance, he said, \u201cI will challenge\nyou to show me any elements in this interior where you can point out and say,\n\u2018Gee, that\u2019s really from the office period.\u2019 \u201d I couldn\u2019t. He boasted that\nhe\u2019d never lost that bet. In the elevator, we met a young resident. She had a\ndog and said that she had been in the building for more than five years.\nBerman seemed disappointed.\n\nOn the twelfth floor, near another modular shelving unit, there was a bright-\nwhite machine labelled \u201cTulu: Your Smart Rental Store.\u201d Using your phone, you\ncould rent household items like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner, or buy\nsomething you\u2019d run out of: tampons, Tide Pods, Doritos. It was a clever way\nto both justify small closets\u2014\u201cNathan believes in very compact closets,\u201d Ruddy\ntold me\u2014and monetize how people live now. \u201cThese people want to snack at\nnight,\u201d Berman said.\n\nAfterward, I walked out into the early FiDi night. I turned onto Exchange\nPlace, where I passed crowds of tourists taking pictures of Kristen Visbal\u2019s\n\u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue. Various restaurants were filling up, from beer halls\nlike Trinity Place to steak houses like the recently renovated Delmonico\u2019s.\nStone Street was now a sort of food court, and I could have picked up\ngroceries at a Whole Foods just north of Exchange Place. (My father would have\nhad to go to the Village to get groceries, if he\u2019d wanted any.) The street\nlife died out at Chambers Street, where government offices stood dark and\nempty. It was as if the original Dutch settlement had been re-created, back\nwhen Wall Street had a wall.\n\nIn a 2022 Glassdoor post, a user called McKinsey Consultant asked, \u201cShould I\nlive in FiDi?\u201d The responses included a lot of cheering for the rooftop pools\nand the great views. But a user called IBM1 advised living somewhere else.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a soulless neighborhood,\u201d IBM1 wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t be swayed by the ultra\nluxe buildings.\u201d It\u2019s true that FiDi remains on the sterile side. It could use\nsome parks, and its inhabitants seem either new to the island or temporary.\nAll those amenities in the buildings keep people within their confines; if you\nhave a Tulu dispensing machine in your basement, who needs to drop by a local\nhardware store or a pharmacy?\n\nAll the same, more than thirty thousand people now live in FiDi\u2014and at least\nsome of them have begun to see it as a permanent home. Berman told me that,\nwhereas more than half of his renters used to be apartment sharers, he\nexpected the percentage at 55 Broad Street to be closer to fifteen. This\nsuggested to him that families were moving in. He added that he recently\nripped out a Ping-Pong room at 180 Water and turned it into a children\u2019s play\nspace. \u201cWe have sixty children in the building!\u201d he said, amazed. One was his\ngrandson. His son, who is the No. 2 at the firm, and his daughter-in-law moved\nin five years ago. \u201cThey never left,\u201d Berman said. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the May 6, 2024, issue, with the headline\n\u201cDesign for Living.\u201d\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * A Harvard undergrad took her roommate\u2019s life, then her own.
