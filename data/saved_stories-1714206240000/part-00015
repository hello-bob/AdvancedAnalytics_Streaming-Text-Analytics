The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house).

This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 / 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 / 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.
