This underexplored problem poses new challenges at the\n> pre-writing stage, including how to research the topic and prepare an\n> outline prior to writing. We propose STORM, a writing system for the\n> Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question\n> Asking. STORM models the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse\n> perspectives in researching the given topic, (2) simulating conversations\n> where writers carrying different perspectives pose questions to a topic\n> expert grounded on trusted Internet sources, (3) curating the collected\n> information to create an outline. For evaluation, we curate FreshWiki, a\n> dataset of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles, and formulate outline\n> assessments to evaluate the pre-writing stage. We further gather feedback\n> from experienced Wikipedia editors. Compared to articles generated by an\n> outline-driven retrieval-augmented baseline, more of STORM's articles are\n> deemed to be organized (by a 25% absolute increase) and broad in coverage\n> (by 10%). The expert feedback also helps identify new challenges for\n> generating grounded long articles, such as source bias transfer and over-\n> association of unrelated facts.\n\nComments:| 27 pages, NAACL 2024 Main Conference  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2402.14207 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2402.14207v2 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.14207arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Yijia Shao [view email] [v1] Thu, 22 Feb 2024 01:20:17 UTC (8,683 KB)\n[v2] Mon, 8 Apr 2024 05:38:50 UTC (8,683 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Assisting in Writing Wikipedia-like Articles\nFrom Scratch with Large Language Models, by Yijia Shao and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2402\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
