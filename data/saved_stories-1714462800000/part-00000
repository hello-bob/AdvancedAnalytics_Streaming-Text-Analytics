Now, Philips has reached a $1.1 billion\ndeal to settle claims from people who say they were injured. A portion of the\nfunds will also go toward medical monitoring.\n\nSome 15 million Philips CPAP and ventilator machines worldwide are affected by\nthe Class I recall, a designation reflecting \"a reasonable probability that\nthe use of, or exposure to, the products will cause serious adverse health\nconsequences or death,\" according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe devices were sold between 2008 and 2021 in the U.S. under the Philips\nRespironics brand, according to Philips' recall notice.\n\n\"Since April 2021, the FDA has received more than 116,000 MDRs [Medical Device\nReports], including 561 reports of death,\" that were either reported or\nsuspected to be related to problems with insulating foam in the Philips\ndevices, the FDA said earlier this year.\n\n\"Philips and Philips Respironics do not admit any fault or liability, or that\nany injuries were caused by Respironics' devices,\" the company said as it\nannounced the new settlement agreement.\n\nHere's an overview of the recall and where consumers stand:\n\n### Settlement money will likely flow next year\n\nThe $1.1 billion deal \u2014 which includes $25 million for medical monitoring \u2014\nstems from mediation by retired magistrate judge Diane M. Welsh, but it's not\nyet final, as the agreement must be filed with a federal court in Pennsylvania\n\u2014 a main state where the machines were produced.\n\nPhilips announced the new settlement on Monday, along with its first-quarter\nfinancial results. The Dutch-based corporation then saw its stock price vault\nto a likely one-day record gain, as investors welcomed news that the recall\nissue seems to have been resolved at a lower cost than analysts predicted.\n\n\"The remediation of the sleep therapy devices for patients is almost\ncomplete,\" said Roy Jakobs, CEO of parent company Royal Philips, in a\nstatement. He added, \"We do regret the concern that patients may have\nexperienced.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached a resolution\" of personal injury claims, the\nplaintiffs' co-lead attorneys, Sandra L. Duggan; Kelly K. Iverson; Christopher\nA. Seeger; and Steven A. Schwartz, said in a joint statement to NPR.\n\nThe money will go to \"users of the now-recalled CPAP and other respiratory\ndevices who suffer from significant physical injuries,\" and to fund research\ninto treating their injuries, the attorneys said. Philips says some 58,000\npeople have filed claims or registered for the settlement.\n\nAs for when consumers could see money from the deal, Philips said it expects\nto make the payments in 2025.\n\n### This isn't the only settlement\n\nNews of the personal injury settlement comes a week after Philips settled a\nclass-action lawsuit over economic damages from the recall.\n\nThat settlement is worth a minimum of $613.3 million, including $94.4 million\nin attorneys' fees. It offers reimbursement to users and \"payers\" \u2014 e.g.,\ninsurance companies \u2014 for recalled machines they had bought or leased.\n\nThe deal was approved last Thursday by senior U.S. district judge Joy Flowers\nConti in the federal Court in western Philadelphia. The judge had previously\nappointed Welsh to serve as mediator in the injury-related class-action suit.\n\nPhilips says it expects to pay that money out this year.\n\n### What can consumers do?\n\nUnder the financial-loss settlement, users are entitled to a $100 award if\nthey return their recalled device by Aug. 9, 2024 \u2014 the claim deadline.\n\nPeople who suspect they own or use one of the affected devices should act soon\nto verify that if they haven't already, the FDA says. The agency notes that\nPhilips' recall page offers ways to check serial numbers and register a\nproduct.\n\nA specially dedicated website is accepting claims for the financial-loss\nsettlement, and it notes that taking part in that deal \"does not affect or\nrelease any claims for personal injuries or medical monitoring relief.\"\n\nUnder the financial-loss settlement, users are also eligible for a payment for\neach recalled device they purchased, leased, or rented \u2014 and if they paid out\nof their own pocket to replace a recalled machine, they could be entitled to a\ndevice replacement award, according to the website.\n\nThe arrangement includes a prepaid shipping label, although the administrators\nalso warn users to consult with their doctor before returning a device they're\nstill using.\n\nA similar claims process will likely emerge for the injury-related deal once\nits terms are finalized.\n\n### Defective machines can send particles, VOCs into airways\n\nThe recall was triggered by thousands of health complaints from CPAP users. An\ninvestigation found that a polyester-based polyurethane foam built into the\ndevices to dampen sound and vibration also had a risk of breaking down \u2014\nespecially when used in warm and humid conditions.\n\n\"If the foam breaks down, black pieces of foam, or certain chemicals that are\nnot visible, could be breathed in or swallowed by the person using the\ndevice,\" the FDA said.\n\nThe agency said in a letter to Philips in 2022 that the foam also \"may degrade\nand/or emit harmful chemicals, potentially resulting in toxic and carcinogenic\neffects and other significant harms to device users,\" listing formaldehyde and\nother volatile organic compounds, or VOCs.\n\n\"Philips has acknowledged that, in a worst-case scenario, exposure to VOCs as\na class may cause possible toxic and carcinogenic effects, as well as\nirritation of the respiratory tract, eyes, nose, and skin, nausea or vomiting,\nhypersensitivity reactions, dizziness, and headache,\" the FDA said.\n\nResulting problems \"could potentially result in serious injury and may require\nmedical intervention to prevent permanent injury,\" the agency said.\n\nThe plan to fix machines with the problem call for replacing the polyester-\nbased foam with one that uses silicone as its base.\n\n### What is the current status of Philips CPAP machines?\n\nU.S. sales of Philips' popular DreamStation and other respiratory units are\ncurrently on hold; the company says it plans to resume selling the devices\nonce it has satisfied the terms of a consent decree with the U.S. government.\n\nPhilips also says it will continue to service units that are still in use,\nincluding by providing replacement parts.\n\n### Shots - Health News\n\n### You Snooze, You Lose: How Insurers Dodge The Costs Of Popular Sleep Apnea\nDevices\n\nLawsuits against the company contend that Philips designed its CPAP machine\npoorly and put it on the market without appropriate warnings.\n\nThe FDA accuses Philips of not taking appropriate action about the dangers of\nthe degrading foam in its CPAP and ventilator devices despite learning about\nthe risk as early as 2015. That year, the FDA said in a letter to the company,\na Philips subsidiary began a preventative procedure because of complaints\nabout the foam breaking down. The agency says it learned about the matter when\nthe FDA inspected a manufacturing plant in Murrysville, Pa., in 2021.\n\nWhen asked about the 2015 revelation, a company representative said the only\ndocumentation of the issue was a single email, with other communications\nhandled over the phone, the FDA said in its letter.\n\n### What is sleep apnea, and how much do CPAP machines cost?\n\nSleep apnea is a disorder that prevents people from getting enough oxygen\nwhile they're sleeping \u2014 it's often characterized by long pauses in breathing,\nand loud snoring. People diagnosed with the disorder rely on continuous\npositive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines to keep their airways open and\nhelp them stay asleep.\n\nLast June, the White House said President Biden was using a CPAP machine to\nhelp with sleep apnea.\n\nPrices for many units range from around $500 to more than $1300.\n\n\"The average cost of a CPAP machine is about $800 among those we reviewed,\"\nthe National Council on Aging said last year.\n\nThe recall also covers some models of Philips' more complicated BiPAP\nventilators, which facilitate both inhalation and exhalation and routinely\ncost hundreds of dollars more.\n\nMany apnea and ventilator devices' users also face additional costs, from\nreplacements parts and upkeep to buying an additional machine for travel.\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 165 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
