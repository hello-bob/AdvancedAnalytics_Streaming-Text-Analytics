Three years later, part of that assembly\nstruck a house in Naples, Fla.\n\nNASA\n\nAlejandro Otero was out of town on vacation last month when his son called\nfrom their house in Naples, Fla., to tell him something shocking and\nincredible. His son, 19, had been home alone when he heard an extremely loud\ncrash \u2014 and realized it came from inside the house.\n\n\"When he called me to give me the news, he asked us to make sure we were\nsitting down to hear when he had to tell us,\" Otero told NPR.\n\n\"He wasn't even sure how to tell me what happened and we had to look and\nlisten to the security cameras to try to piece together what caused the loud\ncrashing noise,\" he said. \"It looked like it caused the whole house to shake,\nso we weren't sure if there had been an earthquake or what. When he saw the\nhole coming through the house, he realized something fell through.\"\n\n### Mystery object is finally identified\n\nAfter rushing back home, Otero called the sheriff's department \u2014 and a deputy\nwho came to the house pulled a hunk of metal out of the floorboards.\n\n\"It was not like anything I had ever seen before,\" Otero said.\n\nHe quickly realized the object wasn't a meteorite. It was cylindrical, and\nwhile one end was melted by the heat of reentry, the other had a smooth round\nshape with a circular indentation. A shallow and uniform groove ran down its\nside.\n\n### Space\n\n### The space junk was supposed to disintegrate in the atmosphere \u2014 it didn't\n\nOtero set out to learn what the object was, posting images and video online.\nHe landed on a likely, yet extraordinary, suspect: a large battery pallet from\nthe International Space Station that NASA released for an uncontrolled\nreentry, three years ago.\n\nThe European Space Agency had warned that the batteries and pallet would\nreenter the atmosphere in the early afternoon of March 8. Otero's house was\nhit that day, shortly after 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nNASA says this stanchion, at right, had been expected to burn up during\nreentry, but instead it struck a man's house in Florida. The object is seen\nhere next to another stanchion in pristine shape, at left. NASA hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nNASA\n\n\"The location of the reentry was predicted by the 18th Space Defense Squadron\nto be in the Gulf of Mexico,\" the Aerospace Corporation, a research and\ndevelopment nonprofit that advises the U.S. government, said in a statement to\nNPR. \"Naples FL was directly downrange of that location and in the direction\nthat the debris would have been traveling.\"\n\nNASA retrieved the object from Otero's home, and it recently confirmed the\nobject was part of the battery pallet \u2014 a remnant of some 5,800 pounds of\nhardware \u2014 that was jettisoned from the space station. The \"space object\" was\na stanchion, NASA said, that held the batteries on a cargo pallet. The\nsurviving object was a little smaller than a soda can and made of Inconel, a\nsuperalloy that is strong and heat-resistant.\n\n### \"We feel very lucky and blessed\"\n\nWhen the object hit Otero's house in southwest Florida, his son was just a\ncouple rooms over from the impact point.\n\n\"We can't help but think about what could have happened if it came through\njust a little to the right or to the left, how much more disastrous the\nsituation could have been,\" Otero said. \"We feel very lucky and blessed that\neveryone was OK.\"\n\nBut the incident also prompted immediate concerns \u2014 from how to deal with a\nhole in the roof to whether the object might be dangerous or toxic. For a\nwhile, Otero's son was on his own.\n\n\"Being alone at the house was worrisome, because he didn't know if the debris\nwas hazardous (or what it was),\" Otero said via email. That concern grew,\nOtero said, when he later realized the object may have been linked to a power\nmodule used in space.\n\n\"Once NASA got in touch with us, my lawyer asked for reasonable assurance from\nthem that the item was not toxic or hazardous,\" Otero said. \"NASA was able to\ngive that assurance,\" he added, and his family was relieved when the agency\ndidn't send people in hazmat suits to retrieve the object.\n\n### Space\n\n### The International Space Station had to move to dodge space junk\n\n\"The hardware was expected to fully burn up during entry through Earth's\natmosphere,\" NASA said after conducting its analysis. The agency is working to\nfigure out how part of it hit Otero's house, adding that it may need to tweak\nthe engineering models it uses to to estimate how objects break up during\natmospheric reentry.\n\nThe incident highlights concerns over the amount of space junk in Earth's\norbit, and it raises a rare and complicated question: Who should pay to repair\na home that's hit by debris plummeting from orbit?\n\n### Filing a claim on damage from a space object\n\nWhen asked how much damage the space object caused, Otero says his homeowners'\ninsurance set the adjusted cost at more than $15,000, adding that he's also\nbeen evaluating other damages not covered by insurance.\n\n\"We are in the process of sending NASA our claim which will include the\ninsurance and non-insurance damages,\" he says, adding that his lawyer has been\nin touch with NASA's legal counsel.\n\nOtero says his insurer quickly helped in bringing in contractors to do repair\nwork.\n\nSo, who might finally be held liable for this sort of damage, when an object\nlaunched into space crashes into someone's home?\n\n\"This is kind of unprecedented,\" Mark Sundahl, who has worked in space law for\nmore than 20 years, told NPR. Determining liability in such cases can be\ncomplicated, he said.\n\n\"It will depend on whose module of the space station that came from,\" said\nSundahl, who is the director of the Global Space Law Center at Cleveland State\nUniversity.\n\n\"We have an international convention on liability for damage caused by outer\nspace objects. It's from 1972. So we have rules in place.\"\n\nIf space debris falls back to Earth, Sundahl said, \"The launching state is\nabsolutely liable for any damage to property or persons that occurs on the\nsurface of the Earth.\"\n\n### Short Wave\n\n### Space Junk: How Cluttered Is The Final Frontier?\n\n\"There's a different rule for [incidents] in space,\" he added. \"If one\nsatellite hits another satellite there, it's not absolute strict liability \u2014\nyou have to show fault. But when something lands on an innocent person and\nit's in their house, there's strict liability.\"\n\nBut, Sundahl added, if the object in question turns out to be part of a U.S.\nmodule, \"then the international law no longer applies. It becomes a domestic\nlegal issue, and a homeowner would have to bring a tort action against the\nfederal government.\"\n\nIn the Naples incident, the object seems to be of U.S. origin: NASA says the\nstanchion came from \"NASA flight support equipment.\" The agency didn't\nimmediately respond to an inquiry from NPR about possible liability.\n\n### Has anything like this happened before?\n\n\"We had a major accident\" involving an object falling out of orbit decades\nago, Sundahl said.\n\nIn 1978, a Soviet satellite, Kosmos 954, \"disintegrated over Canada and\nscattered radioactive fuel across the country,\" he said. \"And they helped\nclean it up \u2014 in accordance with international law, they paid expenses.\"\n\nAbout once every week, Europe's space agency says, a large space object\nreenters the atmosphere, \"with the majority of the associated fragments\nburning up before reaching the ground.\"\n\n### Space\n\n### A Russian missile creates enough space junk to pose risk to astronauts for\nyears\n\nThere have been many cases of space-program debris reentering Earth's\natmosphere and not burning up completely before falling to the surface,\nSundahl says. But those usually fall into the ocean; he's not aware of any\nconfirmed reports of man-made space objects causing damage as in Florida\nrecently.\n\nThere is at least one documented case of a person being hit by something\nfalling from the heavens. A woman in Alabama was struck by a meteorite in 1954\n(she survived with a bruise) \u2014 but that case didn't involve space debris.\n\n\"So this is something new,\" in Florida, said Sundahl, whose group recently\nhosted a symposium on threats posed by orbital debris. The U.S. is currently\ntracking nearly 45,000 objects in orbit, including some 18,800 pieces of space\ndebris, according to Space-Track.org, U.S. Space Command's public website.\n\n\"I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that that's the greatest existing\nthreat to humanity's use of outer space, that we're polluting the orbits to\nthe extent where it could become difficult to use them at all,\" Sundahl said.\n\n### Space\n\n### The International Space Station retires soon. NASA won't run its future\nreplacement.\n\nHe says he's \"very optimistic\" that changes to law and policies can reduce or\neliminate threats to orbit-based systems.\n\n\"We're all so reliant on space infrastructure in so many different ways,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe International Space Station, which is roughly the size of a football\nfield, is itself the subject of a \"deorbit\" plan, as it nears the end of its\nuseful life after more than two decades of continuous human occupancy. NASA\nsays the station will remain operational until at least 2030, and it's\nplanning on \"a controlled re-entry, targeted into a remote, uninhabited area\nin the ocean.\"\n\nAs for Otero, he says, \"There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this\nevent. I hope no one else has to go through this. It was really scary for our\nwhole family and we are just very grateful that no one got physically hurt.\"\n\n  * space station\n  * space junk\n  * International Space Station\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n  * \u00a9 2024 npr\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 162 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
