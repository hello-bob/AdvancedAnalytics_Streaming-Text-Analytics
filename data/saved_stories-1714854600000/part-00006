(August 2010) (Learn how and when to\nremove this message)  \n---  \n  \nRhaphanidosis is the act of inserting the root of a radish into the anus. It\nis mentioned by Aristophanes as a punishment for adultery in Classical Athens\nin the fifth and fourth century BC. It was also a punishment for other sex-\nrelated crimes, such as promiscuity and sodomy.^[1] Later classical references\nto the punishment include Catullus 15, where percurrent raphanique mugilesque\n(both radishes and mullets will run you through) is threatened against those\nwho cast lascivious eyes on a boy (puerum) the poet cares for.\n\nThere is some doubt as to whether the punishment was ever enforced or whether\nthe reference to it in the debate between Right and Wrong in The Clouds of\nAristophanes^[2] should be understood as signifying public humiliation in\ngeneral. However, Nigette Spikes has it that when enforced as a capital\npunishment, tubers so deposited were chosen to be as rough as possible so as\nto cause death by internal hemorrhaging.^[1]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Figging\n  * Gingering\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Spikes, Nigette M.
