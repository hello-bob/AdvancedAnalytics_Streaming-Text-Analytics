A research team led by Dr Serge\nKrasnokutski from the Astrophysics Laboratory at the Max Planck Institute for\nAstronomy at the University of Jena had already demonstrated that simple\npeptides can form on cosmic dust particles. However, it was previously assumed\nthat this would not be possible if molecular ice, which covers the dust\nparticle, contains water \u2013 which is usually the case. Now, the team, in\ncollaboration with the University of Poitiers, France, has discovered that the\npresence of water molecules is not a major obstacle for the formation of\npeptides on such dust particles. The researchers report on their finding in\nthe journal \u201cScience Advances\u201d.\n\nChemistry in the Icy Vacuum\n\n\u201cWe have replicated conditions similar to those in outer space in a vacuum\nchamber, also adding substances that occur in so-called molecular clouds,\u201d\nexplains Krasnokutski. These substances include ammonia, atomic carbon, and\ncarbon monoxide. \u201cThus, all the chemical elements needed for simple peptides\nare present,\u201d adds the physicist.\n\nThese raw materials, Krasnokutski describes, initially form chemical\nprecursors to amino acids known as aminoketenes. These then combine to form\nchains, resulting in polypeptides. \u201cIt was previously suspected that the\nindividual aminoketenes would bond to form peptides,\u201d the scientist explains.\n\u201cHowever, for this step, the absence of water might be crucial as it could\nhinder the reaction. At the same time, most interstellar dust particles are\ncovered with water-containing molecular ice,\u201d says Krasnokutski. Hence, the\nassumption until now has been that if peptides form in space, they do so only\nto a limited extent.\n\nPrecise Analysis in France\n\n\u201cThe highly precise mass spectrometric analyses now possible at the University\nof Poitiers, however, showed that the presence of water in the molecular ice\nslows down the formation of peptides by fifty percent, but they still form,\u201d\nhe explains. \u201cWhen you consider the time scales on which astronomical\nprocesses occur, this slowdown is practically negligible.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether the first biomolecules on our planet are of\nterrestrial or extraterrestrial origin \u2013 or both \u2013 will likely remain\nunresolved for the foreseeable future. However, outer space as a source of our\nlife cannot be ruled out, as this discovery indicates.\n\n#### Journal\n\nScience Advances\n\n#### DOI\n\n10.1126/sciadv.adj7179\n\n#### Method of Research\n\nExperimental study\n\n#### Article Title\n\nFormation of extraterrestrial peptides and their derivatives\n\n#### Article Publication Date\n\n17-Apr-2024\n\nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news\nreleases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of\nany information through the EurekAlert system.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nAxel Burchardt Friedrich-Schiller-Universitaet Jena presse@uni-jena.de Office:\n0049-364-19401421\n\nExpert Contact\n\nDr Sergiy Krasnokutskiy Institute of Solid State Physics of Friedrich Schiller\nUniversity Jena sergiy.krasnokutskiy@uni-jena.de Office: +49 3641 947306\n@UniJena\n\n### More on this News Release\n\n### Peptides on Interstellar Ice\n\nFriedrich-Schiller-Universitaet Jena\n\nJournal\n\n    Science Advances\nDOI\n\n    10.1126/sciadv.adj7179\n\n#### Keywords\n\n#### Original Source\n\nhttps://www.uni-jena.de/en/240417-peptide-eis\n\n### Translations\n\nauf Deutsch\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS)\n\n  * facebook.com/EurekAlert\n  * @EurekAlert\n  * youtube.com/EurekAlert\n\n  * Help / FAQ\n  * Services\n  * Eligibility Guidelines\n  * Contact EurekAlert!\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * DMCA\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Disclaimer\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
