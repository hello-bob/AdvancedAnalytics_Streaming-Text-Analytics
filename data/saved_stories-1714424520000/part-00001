Combining\ndetailed administrative data with survey data on middle schools\u2019 smartphone\npolicies, together with an event-study design, I show that banning smartphones\nsignificantly decreases the health care take-up for psychological symptoms and\ndiseases among girls. Post-ban bullying among both genders decreases.\nAdditionally, girls\u2019 GPA improves, and their likelihood of attending an\nacademic high school track increases. These effects are larger for girls from\nlow socio-economic backgrounds. Hence, banning smartphones from school could\nbe a low-cost policy tool to improve student outcomes.\n\nNote:\n\nFunding Information: This work was partly funded by the Research Council of\nNorway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme, project No. 262700\nand project No. 275800.\n\nConflict of Interests: The author have no competing interests.\n\nKeywords: Smartphones, mental health, grade point average, bullying, test\nscores\n\nJEL Classification: I12, I21, I31, J24, O33\n\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\n\nAbrahamsson, Sara, Smartphone Bans, Student Outcomes and Mental Health\n(February 22, 2024).
