The next day there were more. Then\nthe sightings moved up the seaboard, from Rio Gallegos to the Chubut province\nto Rio Negro to Buenos Aires. Park rangers saw pregnant seals head toward the\nshore, seize up in the water, spasm, and drown.\n\nLater that month, an Argentine veterinarian named Marcela Uhart traveled out\nto Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s, a flat mushroom-shaped peninsula jutting into the\nAtlantic that serves as a popular seal breeding ground. Raised on a ranch in\nthe pampas, Uhart has studied fauna in the region for nearly thirty years; she\ncurrently works in Patagonia for the University of California, Davis. Arriving\nat the peninsula, she found over a thousand dead seal pups, their bodies\nrotting into the sand. \u201cIt was surreal,\u201d she told me last month. \u201cThe beach\n[was] filled with carcasses, scattered individuals, sick and dying, pups that\nwere caught by the tide.\u201d\n\nIt was quickly ascertained that the seals were dying after contracting the\n2.3.4.4b strain of the H5N1 virus\u2014a highly pathogenic, deadly version of the\navian flu. (The \u201cH\u201d in the name corresponds to the hemagglutinin antigens that\nbind the virus to the surface of cells, the \u201cN\u201d to the neuraminidase proteins\nthat help release the virus from infected cells.) The previous fall Peru\u2019s\nMinistry of Health had reported pelicans sick with bird flu off the western\ncoast of South America; in the winter researchers had found sea lions wasted\non the Chilean shore. No one knew how the flu had traveled from one side of\nthe continent to the other. Scientists theorized that it was passed through\npredation or waste, or physical proximity to sick animals, but the specific\nmechanisms of promulgation were unclear. On Punta Le\u00f3n, a sharp cape below\nPen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s, the beach was strewn with dead terns, even as seagulls\npicked at the bodies, seemingly unaffected. Some had pulled lifeless creatures\ninto their nests to use as cushions.\n\nContinue reading for just $1 an issue!\n\nChoose a Digital subscription or our best deal\u2014All Access\u2014that includes print\nand digital issues, full archive access, and the NYR App!\n\nView Offers\n\nOr register for a free account to read just this article.
