A Snohomish man, 56,\nwas commuting in his 2022 Tesla Model S when he activated the car\u2019s camera-\nbased advanced driver assist system and according to his statements to police,\nbegan looking through his phone. With nobody paying attention to the car\u2019s\nactions, the Tesla software ignored Jeffrey Nissen on his motorcycle and\ncontinued on at speed. The car rear-ended the two-wheeler, Nissen was flung\nfrom the bike, and his life ended pinned underneath the electric car, where he\nwas still lodged when police arrived to the scene.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nTesla Beats Charges in Fatal Autopilot Crash Trial\n\nNew Law Bans Elon Musk's Tesla From Advertising as 'Full Self-Driving'\n\nDid Elon Musk Regret Buying Twitter? | Walter Isaacson Interview\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nDid Elon Musk Regret Buying Twitter? | Walter Isaacson Interview\n\nThe Tesla driver, who told police he was \u201cputting the trust in the machine to\ndrive for him,\u201d was inattentive to the road in front of him, and was only\nbrought back to reality when he \u201cheard a bang as the car lurched forward.\u201d The\ndriver was not impaired by drugs or alcohol, though he admitted to having an\nalcoholic beverage prior to the 3:54 p.m. crash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nTesla Beats Charges in Fatal Autopilot Crash Trial\n\nNew Law Bans Elon Musk's Tesla From Advertising as 'Full Self-Driving'\n\nDid Elon Musk Regret Buying Twitter? | Walter Isaacson Interview\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nDid Elon Musk Regret Buying Twitter? | Walter Isaacson Interview\n\nLocal news reports say the driver was using \u201cAutopilot\u201d rather than \u201cFull\nSelf-Driving\u201d though the two systems are often conflated. The current FSD\nsoftware requires drivers to keep their eyes up on the road for the system to\nremain active, where Autopilot doesn\u2019t seem to require this. Autopilot is\nlittle more than lane keep assist paired with a camera-based cruise control\nsystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla will claim that it isn\u2019t culpable for the incident, as the official line\nis that its so-called Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software are \u201cintended\nfor use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and\nare prepared to take over at any moment.\u201d The company and its CEO, however,\nhave knowingly engaged in public discussion describing the cars as \u201cdriving\nthemselves\u201d and the people buying these cars believe them. This isn\u2019t even the\nfirst time a \u201cself-driving\u201d Tesla has run over a motorcyclist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Tesla driver, who is not named, was booked into the Snohomish County Jail\nwith a charge of Vehicular Homicide. He posted a $100,000 bail on Sunday.\n\nAccording to a survey by Forbes, 93 percent of Americans have concerns about\nself-driving car safety, and 61 percent say they wouldn\u2019t trust a self-driving\ncar. But when it comes to Tesla \u201cbeta testing\u201d this half-baked software on our\npublic streets, we don\u2019t get the legal opportunity to challenge it. Some Tesla\ndrivers get to risk the lives of everyone around them because they paid for\nthe privilege. The system can\u2019t even see a fucking motorcyclist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jalopnik.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": true}
