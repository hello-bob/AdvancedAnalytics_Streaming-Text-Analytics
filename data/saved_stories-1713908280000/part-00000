It has been proposed previously that the\nvibrational spectrum of granular packings can be approximately obtained from\nrandom matrix theory. Here, we show that the autocorrelation function of the\ndensity of states shows good agreement between dynamical numerical simulations\nof frictionless bead packs near the jamming point and the analytic predictions\nof the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble of random matrices; there is clear\ndisagreement with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, establishing that the\nLaguerre ensemble correctly reproduces the universal statistical properties of\njammed granular matter and excluding the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. We also\npresent a random lattice model which is a physically motivated variant of the\nrandom matrix ensemble. Numerical calculations reveal that this model\nreproduces the known features of the vibrational density of states of\nfrictionless granular matter, while also retaining the correlation structure\nseen in the Laguerre random matrix theory.\n\n### Graphic abstract\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Anisotropic Elastic Strain-Gradient Continuum from the Macro-Scale to the\nGranular Micro-Scale\n\nArticle Open access 05 April 2024\n\nP.

For\nstatic assemblies, the distribution of forces [1, 2] and the continuum limit\n[3] are difficult to obtain. This is because interparticle contacts are very\nstiff: a slight compression of two particles that are in contact, by an amount\nthat is much less than the interparticle separation, gives rise to large\nforces. Added complications are caused by the fact that, for noncohesive\ngranular matter, two particles in contact repel each other when they are\ncompressed, but do not attract each other when they are moved away from each\nother and the contact is broken; that the repulsive force between particles is\nnot a linear function of their compression when the compression is small; [4]\nand that there are frictional forces between particles, [5] resulting in\nhistory dependent forces. The dynamic properties of granular matter are\ndifficult to understand because interparticle collisions are strongly\ninelastic. If a high density of particles builds up in a region because of\nrandom fluctuations, the collision rate and therefore the rate of energy loss\nincreases in the region. This can trap particles in the region, causing the\ndensity fluctuations to grow. [6] Experimentally, one observes distinctive\nphenomena such as force chains and stability against mechanical collapse in\nvery sparse static packings, non-Maxwellian velocity distributions [7,8,9] and\ninelastic collapse in dilute granular gases, [10, 11] and shear thinning and\nshear thickening. [12]\n\nThe tendency of flowing granular matter to get \u2018jammed\u2019 and stop flowing at\nlow densities is a practical problem that limits the flow rate in the\nindustrial use of granular materials. [13] Remarkably, the transition from a\nflowing to a jammed state in granular matter, structural glasses, and foams\nand colloids, can be studied with a unified approach. [14] When the transition\noccurs at zero temperature and zero shear stress as the density is varied, the\ntransition point is called \u2018Point J,\u2019 [15] and is characterized by diverging\nlength scales [16, 17] suggestive of a second-order phase transition. At the\nsame time, other properties of the system change discontinuously at Point J\n[15] as one would expect at a first-order phase transition.\n\nThe density of states for vibrational modes in a granular system is one of the\nproperties that has a signature of the transition at Point J. A jammed\ngranular system has mechanical rigidity. Even though the force between two\nparticles is a nonlinear function of the compression between them, the small\ndeviations from the jammed state (which already has nonzero compression) can\nbe analyzed using a linear model, resulting in normal modes. Extensive\nnumerical simulations [15] on systems at zero temperature and zero shear\nstress show that the density of states \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) as a function of\n\\\\(\\omega \\\\) approaches zero linearly as \\\\(\\omega \\rightarrow 0\\\\) if the\nparticle density is greater than the critical density. As the particle density\nis reduced, the slope of \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) at the origin becomes steeper,\nuntil at Point J, \\\\(\\rho (\\omega \\rightarrow 0) \\ne 0.\\\\)\n\nIn the linearized analysis of vibrational modes, the system can be treated as\na network of random springs, with the number of springs decreasing as Point J\nis approached. It is natural to analyze the problem using random matrices, and\nsee how the resultant density of states evolves near the transition. This has\nbeen done [18, 19] using the Laguerre ensemble instead of the Gaussian\northogonal ensemble (GOE) for the random matrices, in accordance with\u2014as\ndiscussed in the next section of this paper\u2014the symmetries of the problem. The\nmodel yields a broad peak in the density of states that reaches \\\\(\\omega =\n0\\\\) as the transition is approached. However, the model also predicts a gap\nin the density of states near \\\\(\\omega = 0\\\\) above the transition, which\ndoes not match the numerical results. This is not surprising, because the\ndensity of states predicted by random matrix theory is well known to suffer\nfrom non-universal effects [20]. For instance, the density of states can be\nchanged at will by varying the assumed distribution of the matrix elements.\n[21] Instead, the correlations in the density of states and the distribution\nof level spacings are more reliable indicators of the validity of the random\nmatrix approach [20].\n\nThe agreement of the level spacing distribution with the GOE result has been\nobserved elsewhere [22, 23] without reference to the Laguerre ensemble. The\ndistribution of level spacings has been studied for the Laguerre ensemble\n[24], without comparing to the numerical data for bead packs, but it is\nunfortunately indistinguishable from the results for the GOE. Taken together,\nRefs. [22,23,24] show that the level spacing distribution for bead packs is\nconsistent with random matrix theory, without being able to confirm the\nappropriate ensemble.\n\nTo summarize, the density of states for random matrix ensembles is known to be\na non-universal feature; not surprisingly, therefore, the density of states\nfor the simplest version of the Laguerre ensemble shows qualitative\ndifferences from the density of states of granular vibrational modes observed\nin numerical simulations. On the other hand, the level spacing distribution is\nfound to be too universal: there is agreement between the Laguerre ensemble\nand numerical simulations, but there is equally good agreement between the GOE\nand numerical simulations. Thus, neither of these can be considered as\nconclusive evidence for the Laguerre ensemble.\n\nIn this paper, we therefore turn to the correlations in the density of states\npredicted by random matrix theory. We consider the correlation function for\nthe Laguerre ensemble, which differs from that for the GOE near the low-\nfrequency edge of the allowed range of \\\\(\\omega \\\\) [25]. By comparing the\ncorrelations in the numerically computed vibrational spectrum of frictionless\nbead packs near the jamming transition to the predictions of the Laguerre\nensemble and the GOE, we are able to demonstrate good agreement with the\nformer and to exclude the latter.\n\nIn addition, we construct a random lattice model, which is a physically\nmotivated variant of the random matrix ensemble. Although it is not possible\nto calculate the properties of this model analytically, numerical results\nreveal that all the qualitative features of \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) are\nreproduced. At the same time, the correlation functions and the level spacing\ndistribution seen in the idealized random matrix theory are not significantly\nchanged. Models that are essentially mean field versions of our model have\nbeen studied earlier [26, 27], and differ from our results mainly in the fact\nthat the low-frequency \\\\(\\rho (\\omega ) \\sim \\omega ^{d-1}\\\\) behavior for a\nd-dimensional system is not seen. The random lattice model is a variation of a\nmodel used earlier to study the static properties of free-standing granular\npiles (with vector forces) [28]; the fact that such similar models yield\nresults in agreement with different experiments increases the credibility of\nthe model.\n\nOther authors have studied variations of random matrix theory: Ref [29] is an\nearly random matrix model for the related problem of the vibrational spectrum\nof glasses close to the glass transition. Reference [30] studies several\ndifferent random matrix ensembles and their effect on the structure of\neigenmodes with frequencies in the boson peak. Reference [31] uses weighted\nLaplacian dynamical matrices to reproduce an intermediate regime in \\\\(\\rho\n(\\omega )\\\\) (between the boson peak and the low-frequency behavior) and\n\\\\(\\sim \\omega ^4\\\\) scaling of the density of states in this regime.\nReference [32] uses a combination of a random and a regular matrix for the\ndynamical matrix, to eliminate the gap near \\\\(\\omega = 0.\\\\) Also, Ref. [33]\nhas studied an abstract model that they argue is in the appropriate\nuniversality class.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews why the\nsymmetry properties of the systems in which we are interested are in the\nLaguerre universality class rather than the GOE. Section 3 has the first main\nresult of this paper: that the analytically calculated autocorrelation\nfunction for the density of energy levels of the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble\nagrees with the correlation function from dynamical simulations on bead packs,\nin the vicinity of Point J, but that this is not true for the correlation\nfunction for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. Section 4 has the second main\nresult of this paper: that the random lattice model, which retains some\nspatial correlations discarded by the simple random matrix model, is\nnumerically found to have a similar behavior for the density of energy levels\nas seen in the molecular dynamics simulations, both at and away from Point J.\nThe energy level correlation function and the level spacings for the random\nlattice model are also seen to agree with the molecular dynamics results (and\nthe Laguerre ensemble results), in accordance with the expectation that such\ncorrelations should only depend on the symmetries of the problem instead of\nthe model details. Thus, the random lattice model retains the points of\nagreement between the Laguerre ensemble and molecular dynamics, and also\nsuccessfully reproduces the density of states.\n\n## 2 Laguerre ensembles\n\nWe follow the approach of Ref. [18, 19] here. Within linear response, if the\nparticles in a frictionless granular assembly are displaced slightly from\ntheir resting positions, their accelerations are of the form \\\\(\\ddot{x} = -K\nx,\\\\) where x is a N component column vector with (a rescaled version of) the\ndisplacements of all the particles and K is a \\\\(N\\times N\\\\) matrix called\nthe dynamical matrix [34]. If d is the dimensionality of the granular\nassembly, then each particle has d components to its displacement, and N is\ntherefore equal to d times the number of particles.\n\nThe crucial observation [35, 36] is that the connection between accelerations\nand displacements is a two-step process. Within linear response, each contact\nbetween a pair of particles can be represented as a spring that has been\nprecompressed by some amount. Thus, one has a network of springs, with various\nspring constants. When a particle is displaced, it stretches (or compresses)\neach spring that it is connected to, by an amount that is equal to the\ncomponent of its displacement along that spring. Thus, we have\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\Delta \\ell _\\alpha = {\\tilde{A}}_{\\alpha j} x_j\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\\\(\\Delta \\ell _\\alpha \\\\) is the amount by which the spring labeled\n\\\\(\\alpha \\\\) is compressed. Here, \\\\(x_j\\\\) is one component of the\ndisplacement of one of the particles in the assembly. If the particle is one\nof the two that is involved in the \\\\(\\alpha \\\\)\u2019th contact, then\n\\\\({\\tilde{A}}_{\\alpha j}\\\\) is simply \\\\(\\cos \\theta _{\\alpha j},\\\\) where\n\\\\(\\theta _{\\alpha j}\\\\) is the angle between the direction of the \\\\(\\alpha\n\\\\)\u2019th spring and the direction of the j\u2019th displacement, i.e., \\\\(\\cos \\theta\n_{\\alpha j} x_j\\\\) is the compression of the contact caused by the\ndisplacement. If \\\\(x_j\\\\) is not associated with either of the particles\ninvolved in the \\\\(\\alpha \\\\)\u2019th contact, then \\\\(\\tilde{A}_{\\alpha j} = 0.\\\\)\nNote that \\\\({\\tilde{A}}\\\\) is a rectangular matrix: if there are M\ninterparticle contacts and N particle displacements, then \\\\({\\tilde{A}}\\\\) is\nan \\\\(M\\times N\\\\) matrix. As one approaches Point J, the number of contact\nforces decreases, being equal to N at the transition.\n\nThe spring exerts a restoring force that is proportional to this compression;\nthe spring constant \\\\(k_\\alpha \\\\) can be different for each spring. The\nrestoring force on each particle is the sum of the forces from all the springs\nit is connected to. Therefore,\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} m_j \\ddot{x}_j = - {\\tilde{A}}^T_{j\\alpha } k_\\alpha \\Delta\n\\ell _\\alpha , \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(2)\n\ni.e., the \\\\(\\alpha \\\\)\u2019th contact force acts as a restoring force on\n\\\\(x_j\\\\) only if \\\\(x_j\\\\) is associated with one of the two particles\ninvolved in the \\\\(\\alpha \\\\)\u2019th contact, in which case \\\\(A^T_{j\\alpha }\\\\)\nis the same projection factor \\\\(\\cos \\theta _{\\alpha j}\\\\) that we had in the\ndependence of \\\\(f_\\alpha \\\\) on \\\\(x_j.\\\\) Putting this equation together\nwith Eq. (1), we have\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} m_j \\ddot{x}_j = - {\\tilde{A}}^T_{j\\alpha } k_\\alpha\n{\\tilde{A}}_{\\alpha i} x_i. \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(3)\n\nDefining \\\\(A_{\\alpha j} = \\sqrt{k}_\\alpha {\\tilde{A}}_{\\alpha\nj}/\\sqrt{m}_j,\\\\) this is equivalent to\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\sqrt{m_j}\\ddot{x}_j = - A^T_{j\\alpha } A_{\\alpha i}\n\\sqrt{m_i} x_i \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(4)\n\nWe have implicitly assumed that the particles are frictionless spheres, so\nthat torque balance is trivially satisfied. Absorbing a factor of\n\\\\(\\sqrt{m_j}\\\\) in \\\\(x_j\\\\) for each j, we finally have the equation\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\ddot{x}_j = - A^T_{j\\alpha } A_{\\alpha i} x_i ,\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n(5)\n\ni.e., the dynamical matrix K is a \\\\(N\\times N\\\\) matrix that is equal to\n\\\\(A^T A.\\\\)\n\nIn the random matrix approach to this problem, we assume that all the entries\nin the matrix A are independent Gaussian random variables, drawn from a\ndistribution with zero mean and (with a suitable rescaling) unit variance.\nThis is the Laguerre random matrix ensemble (also known as the Wishart\nensemble in the mathematical literature), and is different from assuming that\nthe elements of K are independent Gaussian random variables (with the\nconstraint that K is a symmetric matrix). The approach to Point J is modeled\nby adjusting the ratio M/N to approach 1 from above.\n\nThe random matrix approach ignores the fact that each contact force acts\nbetween only two particles, i.e., that each row in the matrix A has only 2d\nentries. It also ignores the fact that the network of contacts is created by\nparticles rearranging themselves, which would be expected to result in\ncorrelations between the contact forces. To address these limitations, one\nwould need to construct a model which includes spatial information about the\ncontacts (or perform a full molecular dynamics simulation), discussed in Sect.\n4 of this paper. When this is done, the non-universal results from random\nmatrix theory are affected without changing the universal results.\n\nIt can be shown [37] that, for \\\\(M \\ge N,\\\\) the density of states for the\neigenfrequencies \\\\(\\omega _1, \\omega _2\\ldots \\omega _N\\\\) is\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\rho (\\omega ){} & {} = \\frac{1}{N \\pi } \\frac{\\sqrt{(N b^2\n- \\omega ^2)(\\omega ^2 - N a^2)}}{\\omega } \\nonumber \\\\\\\\{} & {} \\quad a\n\\sqrt{N}< \\omega < b\\sqrt{N} \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \\\\(a = \\sqrt{M/N}-1\\\\) and \\\\(b = \\sqrt{M/N} + 1.\\\\) When \\\\(M/N > 1,\\\\)\nthere is a broad peak in \\\\(\\rho (\\omega ),\\\\) with a gap in the spectrum near\n\\\\(\\omega = 0.\\\\) The peak is not symmetric, falling off much more sharply on\nthe small \\\\(\\omega \\\\) side than on the large \\\\(\\omega \\\\) side. In the\nmiddle, the peak slopes downwards as \\\\(\\omega \\\\) is increased. As M/N is\nreduced, the gap shrinks while the width of the peak remains constant. When\n\\\\(M/N = 1,\\\\) \\\\(\\rho (\\omega ) = \\sqrt{4 N - \\omega ^2}/(N\\pi )\\\\) which\nmatches the Wigner semicircle law for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, and\n\\\\(\\rho (\\omega =0)\\ne 0.\\\\)\n\nFig. 1\n\nPlot of \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) vs \\\\(\\omega ,\\\\) with \\\\(\\omega \\\\) scaled by\n\\\\(\\sqrt{N},\\\\) for (red, solid) \\\\(M/N = 1.0\\\\) and (blue, dashed) \\\\(M/N =\n1.2.\\\\) For \\\\(M/N = 1.2,\\\\) the gap at small \\\\(\\omega \\\\) and the asymmetry\nof the peak are clearly visible. As M/N is increased, the asymmetry in the\nshape persists, the gap at small \\\\(\\omega \\\\) broadens, and the range of\n\\\\(\\omega /\\sqrt{N}\\\\) for which \\\\(\\rho (\\omega ) \\ne 0\\\\) remains equal to\n\\\\(b-a = 2\\\\)\n\nFull size image\n\nOne can compare these analytical predictions with numerical results, with data\nfrom the O\u2019Hern group [38]. The details of how the numerical simulations were\nconducted are given in Ref. [38], but to summarize: approximately 1000\nfrictionless bidisperse disks (half large and half small) with a diameter\nratio of 1.4 were placed randomly in a square cell with periodic boundary\nconditions, and allowed to relax to equilibrium, at which point the\nfrequencies of the normal modes were measured. The interaction between the\ndisks was harmonic (only under compression), but the spring constant was\ndifferent for large\u2013large, large\u2013small and small\u2013small contacts. As with the\nanalytical prediction, there is a broad peak that falls off more sharply at\nsmall \\\\(\\omega \\\\) than at large \\\\(\\omega .\\\\) The density of states \\\\(\\rho\n(\\omega =0) = 0\\\\) except at the transition. However, the numerical data does\nnot show the gap in the spectrum near \\\\(\\omega = 0\\\\) predicted by random\nmatrix theory. The numerical data also has a pronounced boson peak at a\nnonzero value of \\\\(\\omega ,\\\\) and a cusp in \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) at the\norigin at the transition [15]. These features do not agree with the prediction\nfrom random matrix theory, but as already discussed, random matrix theory is\nnot expected to yield the (non-universal) density of states correctly. We\nreturn to this point in Sect. 4, on the random lattice model.\n\n## 3 Correlations\n\nIn this section, we subject the predictions of the random matrix model to more\nstringent and appropriate tests, by studying the (universal) correlations. The\nkey feature of the random matrix spectrum is that it is rigid (i.e., highly\ncorrelated). The rigidity of the spectrum is revealed at small energy scales\nby the distribution of consecutive level spacings. The longer range rigidity\ncan be demonstrated by the autocorrelation of the density of states or by\nspecific statistical measures such as the number statistic and the spectral\nrigidity [20].\n\nInsight into the strong correlations between the eigenvalues implied by the Laguerre ensemble distribution is provided by the following plasma analogy. We focus on the case \\\\(M = N+1\\\\) since we are interested in the spectrum for point J. For the Laguerre ensemble, the rigidity of the spectrum arises from the factors of \\\\(|\\omega _j^2 - \\omega _i^2|\\\\) in the joint probability distribution \\\\(p (\\omega _1, \\omega _2, \\ldots , \\omega _N)\\\\) for the eigenvalues given by Eq. (A2) If we rewrite this as \\\\(\\exp (\\ln |\\omega _j - \\omega _i | + \\ln |\\omega _j + \\omega _i |),\\\\) we can interpret the probability distribution as the partition function of a classical plasma of N particles located on the positive \\\\(\\omega \\\\) axis at the locations \\\\(\\omega _1, \\ldots , \\omega _N\\\\) with logarithmic interactions between the particles as well and between each particle and image particles at locations \\\\(-\\omega _1, \\ldots , -\\omega _N\\\\). The particles are also confined near the origin by a quadratic potential and are constrained to remain on the positive \\\\(\\omega \\\\) axis by a hard wall at the origin. The plasma analogy is another argument to only consider correlations for \\\\(M\\approx N.\\\\) If \\\\(M/N > 1\\\\) (in the \\\\(N\\rightarrow \\infty \\\\) limit), the gap in the Laguerre spectrum \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) near \\\\(\\omega = 0\\\\) means that the particles and their images are well separated. The correlations between energy levels in the Laguerre ensemble will then be indistinguishable from those for the GOE. Even for \\\\(M\\approx N,\\\\) the difference between the two ensembles should be greatest near \\\\(\\omega = 0.\\\\)\n\nIn terms of the variables \\\\(x_i = \\omega _i^2\\\\), the one-point and two-point\ncorrelation functions are defined as\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} R_1 (x) = N \\int _0^\\infty d x_2 \\ldots \\int _0^\\infty d x_N\nP(x, x_2, \\ldots , x_N)\\nonumber \\\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(7)\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} R_2 (x, y) = N(N-1) \\int _0^\\infty d x_3 \\ldots\n\\nonumber \\\\\\\\{} & {} \\quad \\int _0^\\infty d x_N P(x, y, x_3,\\ldots , x_N)\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n(8)\n\nHere, P denotes the joint probability distribution of the squared frequencies\n\\\\(x_i = \\omega _i^2\\\\) which can easily be deduced from the joint probability\ndistribution \\\\(p ( \\omega _1, \\omega _2, \\ldots , \\omega _N)\\\\) given in Eq.\n(A2). The plasma analogy shows that calculation of the correlation functions\nin Eqs. (7) and (8) is a formidable problem in classical statistical\nmechanics. Nonetheless, it has been exactly done by Nagao and Slevin [25] by\nrewriting the probability density in the form of a quaternion determinant and\nperforming the integrals by a generalization of a theorem of Dyson [39] on\nintegration over quaternion determinants. Before we give those results, we\nfirst describe the unfolding procedure.\n\n\\\\(R_1(x)\\\\) is evidently the density of states, and we now define\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\xi (x) = \\int _0^x d x^\\prime \\; R_1 (x^\\prime )\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \\\\(\\xi (x)\\\\) is the cumulative density of states. The unfolded two\npoint correlation function is then defined as\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} L_2 (\\xi _1, \\xi _2) = \\frac{1}{R_1[ x (\\xi _1) ]}\n\\frac{1}{R_1 [ x(\\xi _2) ]} R_2 [ x (\\xi _1), x(\\xi _2)]\\nonumber \\\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n(10)\n\nThe exact expression for \\\\(L_2\\\\) is rather lengthy and is given in the\nAppendix.\n\nIn Fig. 2, we plot \\\\(1 - L_2(\\xi , 0)\\\\) as a function of \\\\(\\xi \\\\) for the\nLaguerre ensemble. The corresponding plot for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble\nis also shown. When \\\\(\\xi \\\\) is large, the two curves approach each other.\nIndeed, the analytical expression for \\\\(1 - L_2(\\xi )\\\\) for \\\\(\\xi \\gg 1\\\\)\nin the Laguerre ensemble can be verified to be\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} 1 - L_2 (\\xi , 0)\\nonumber \\\\\\ {}{} & {} = \\frac{\\sin\n^2 \\pi \\xi }{ ( \\pi \\xi )^2} + \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} - \\int _0^\\xi d y \\frac{\n\\sin \\pi y}{\\pi y} \\right] \\left[ \\frac{ \\cos \\pi \\xi }{\\xi } - \\frac{1}{\\pi\n\\xi ^2} \\sin \\pi \\xi \\right] \\nonumber \\\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(11)\n\nwhich coincides with the form for the same quantity in the GOE, as expected\nsince the effect of the image charges in the plasma analogy for the Laguerre\nensemble should be small when \\\\(\\xi \\\\) is large. However, although the two\ncurves coincide in the asymptotic limit \\\\(\\xi \\gg 1\\\\), Fig. 2 shows that\nthere is a range of \\\\(\\xi \\\\) values where the predictions of the Laguerre\nensemble differ significantly from the GOE. Hence, comparison to the\ncorrelation function for the numerical data for the spectrum of the jammed\nbead pack provides a stringent test that is able to distinguish between the\nLaguerre ensemble and the GOE.\n\nFig. 2\n\nThe correlation function \\\\(1 - L_2 (\\xi , 0)\\\\) is computed using vibrational\nspectra from 1000 realizations of the jammed state. It appears as a staircase\nin the plot due to the finite widths of the bins used to compute the\ncorrelation. Also shown are the analytic results for the Gaussian orthogonal\nensemble (dotted blue curve) and the Laguerre ensemble (solid black curve).\nThe agreement of the vibrational data to the Laguerre ensemble is clearly\nsuperior. The vibrational spectrum data are based on simulations by Kyle\nVander Werf and Corey O\u2019Hern described in Sect. 2\n\nFull size image\n\nThe numerical data are analyzed as follows. The vibrational frequencies\nobtained in the numerical simulations from all the 1000 realizations of the\njammed state are merged together, and bins are constructed with 200\neigenvalues in each, i.e., there is an average of 0.2 eigenvalues per\nrealization of the jammed state in each bin. Next, we calculate\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} 1 - \\frac{1}{(0.2)^2} [\\langle n_0 n_i\\rangle - \\langle n_0\n\\rangle \\delta _{i0}] \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \\\\(n_i\\\\) is the number of vibrational frequencies in the\n\\\\(i^{\\textrm{th}}\\\\) bin in any given realization, and the average is over\nthe realizations of the jammed state. The histogram of the values obtained for\nthis discretized correlation function is compared with the analytical\nprediction from the Laguerre ensemble and the GOE, and as seen in Fig. 2, the\nLaguerre ensemble fits the data very well within the error bars (while the GOE\ndoes not).\n\nFor completeness, we also compute the distribution of level spacings from the\nnumerically computed vibrational spectra for bead packs [38]. This is shown in\nFig. 3. Although the plasma analogy would suggest that the level spacing\ndistribution could be different in the vicinity of \\\\(\\omega = 0\\\\) and for\nlarge \\\\(\\omega ,\\\\) this is not found to be the case; both distributions are\nfound to be indistinguishable from the Wigner surmise, which also\nmatches\u2014within our level of resolution\u2014 the distributions for the Laguerre\nensemble [24] and the GOE. Thus, although the level spacing distribution is\nconsistent with the Laguerre ensemble, it does not discriminate between the\nLaguerre and Gaussian orthogonal ensembles.\n\nFig. 3\n\nThe red (solid) and blue (dashed) histograms show the consecutive level\nspacing distribution for the numerically computed vibrational spectra of\njammed frictionless granular material. An ensemble of one thousand\nrealizations of the jammed state was used. The red histogram bins the eleven\nconsecutive level spacings between the frequencies \\\\(\\omega _5\\\\) through\n\\\\(\\omega _{16}\\\\) for each realization; the blue histogram eleven consecutive\nspacings between frequencies \\\\(\\omega _{400}\\\\) through \\\\(\\omega _{411}\\\\).\nEach spacing \\\\(\\omega _{i+1} - \\omega _i\\\\) is normalized by \\\\(\\langle\n\\omega _{i+1} - \\omega _i\\rangle ,\\\\) where the average is taken over the one\nthousand realizations. The black curve corresponds to the Wigner surmise for\nthe level spacing distribution of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (which is\nindistinguishable from the Wigner surmise for the Laguerre ensemble at this\nlevel of resolution, as discussed in Appendix Appendix B). The close agreement\nbetween the two histograms and the solid black curve are consistent with the\npredictions of our random matrix model of the jammed state of frictionless\ngranular matter\n\nFull size image\n\n## 4 Random Lattice model\n\nAs discussed earlier, the extent to which the density \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) of\nvibrational frequencies for jammed frictionless granular materials agrees with\nthe predictions of random matrix theory is not a good test of the\napplicability of random matrix theory to these materials, because the\ndistribution of eigenvalues is a non-universal prediction of random matrix\ntheory. Nevertheless, there are qualitative discrepancies between the\nnumerically measured \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) [38] and the density of eigenvalues\n\\\\(\\\\{\\omega _i\\\\}\\\\) obtained from random matrix theory that are worth trying\nto address: the low-frequency gap, the absence of a cusp at \\\\(\\omega = 0\\\\)\nat the transition and the absence of a boson peak.\n\nIn Eq. (5), we have assumed that the entries in the matrix A are all\nindependent random variables drawn from a Gaussian distribution. In reality,\nsince the matrix A is supposed to be a mapping from coordinates to contact\nforces, and only two particles are associated with a contact, only the entries\nassociated with two particles (with d entries per particle for d-dimensional\nparticles) should be nonzero in any column of A. Thus, A should be a sparse\nmatrix.\n\nIn mean field theory, one would choose the two particles associated with each\nforce randomly. This would result in the system breaking up into separate\nclusters, not connected to each other, leading to an overabundance of zero\nmodes unless one only retains the giant connected cluster. Moreover, the\nconcept of adjacency would not be respected: two randomly chosen particles\nwould be likely to be far apart, and should not have been allowed to share a\ncontact.\n\nInstead of choosing the particles associated with a force randomly, we\napproximate the system as being equivalent to a triangular lattice (with\nperiodic boundary conditions), but with each particle displaced from the\nposition where it would be in a perfect triangular lattice. This randomizes\nthe orientation of the contacts between particles (Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4\n\nArrangement of particles in the random lattice model. Each particle rests on\nat least the two nearest neighbors below it, shown as solid lines. In\naddition, a particle occasionally also has a contact with a next nearest\nneighbor below it on one side or the other. For clarity, these are shown as\ndashed lines, even though they are completely equivalent to the solid bonds.\nEach particle therefore has two, three or four contacts from above. Periodic\nboundary conditions are imposed on all four boundaries. As shown, the\nnumbering convention results in the particle (x, y) being shifted horizontally\nby half a lattice spacing compared to \\\\((x, y - 1).\\\\) The bond angles are\nchosen randomly, and the vibrational spectrum calculated\n\nFull size image\n\nTo be specific, particles are arranged in successive horizontal layers, with\neach particle having contacts with the two particles immediately below it:\nslightly to the left and slightly to the right. Shifting the numbering in each\nrow by half a lattice spacing relative to its predecessor, the particle (i, j)\nconnects to the particles numbered \\\\((i, j - 1)\\\\) and \\\\((i + 1, j - 1)\\\\)\nwith periodic boundary conditions in both directions. (A particle in the\nbottom layer, (i, 1), connects with \\\\((i - L/2, L)\\\\) and \\\\((i + 1 - L/2,\nL)\\\\) in the topmost layer, where L is the number of layers.) In addition,\neach particle has a probability p of connecting to an additional particle in\nthe row below it, i.e., a probability of 0.5p of connecting to the particle at\n\\\\((i - 1, j - 1)\\\\) and a probability of 0.5p of connecting to the particle\nat \\\\((i + 2, j - 1),\\\\) again with periodic boundary conditions. All contacts\nare bidirectional, so that each particle is connected to two to four particles\nin the row above it. The spring constant \\\\(\\kappa \\\\) associated with each\ncontact is an independent random variable, with probability density\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\rho (\\kappa )d\\kappa = 3 \\kappa ^2 \\exp [-\\kappa ^3]\nd\\kappa . \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(13)\n\nThis is what one would expect with exponentially distributed contact forces.\nSince the contact force f at a Hertzian contact is related to the compression\n\\\\(\\delta x\\\\) of the contact as \\\\(f\\sim (\\delta x)^{3/2},\\\\) and the linear\nstiffness if the compression \\\\(\\delta x\\\\) is changed by a small amount is\nfound by differentiating this expression to be \\\\(\\kappa \\sim (\\delta\nx)^{1/2},\\\\) therefore \\\\(f \\sim \\kappa ^3.\\\\) We choose units in which \\\\(f =\n\\kappa ^3.\\\\) Thus, an exponential probability density for f implies\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\rho (f) df = \\exp [-f] df = \\exp [-\\kappa ^3] (3 \\kappa ^2\nd\\kappa ) \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(14)\n\nThe bond connecting a particle to its left (right) neighbor in the row below\npoints down and to the left (right), and the bond angles are uniform random\nvariables in the third (fourth) quadrant. If the particle at (i, j) is also\nconnected to \\\\((i-1, j - 1),\\\\) this bond angle is also chosen to be a\nuniform random variable in the third quadrant, with the constraint that it\nmust be more horizontal than the bond between (i, j) and \\\\((i, j - 1).\\\\)\n(There is a similar condition if the additional contact is to the right, to\n\\\\((i + 2, j - 1).\\\\)) This model is similar to a model introduced for free-\nstanding granular piles [28], which is a vector generalization of the scalar-\nforce \u2018q-Model\u2019 used to model such systems [1, 2]. We expect that our results\nwill not depend on the details of the model, as long as the spring constants\nand bond angles are random, the locality of interactions is respected, and the\nnumber of contacts made by an individual particle can vary in order to\napproach the jamming transition.\n\nHaving constructed the lattice, it is easy to obtain the matrix A, and\ntherefore the eigenvalues of \\\\(A^T A.\\\\) One difference from the Laguerre\nensemble is that each contact is associated with two particles, and therefore\nfour displacement variables, i.e., each row of \\\\(A_{\\alpha i}\\\\) has exactly\nfour nonzero entries. Another difference is that the translational invariance\nof the system is respected by the matrix A; the consequence of this is\ndiscussed later in this section.\n\nUnlike the dynamical simulations, we compare with [38], the random lattice\nmodel uses a Hertzian contact force law rather than a harmonic law (with a\ndistribution of spring constants). It also has the property that every lattice\nsite is connected to at least two above it and two below, whereas granular\nassemblies will have some particles with less than four contacts. Most\nimportantly, the random lattice model does not enforce force balance at each\nlattice site. The objective with the random lattice model is to show that\nrandomness and locality are sufficient to yield the qualitative aspects of the\ndensity of states while preserving the level spacing distribution and the\nspectral correlations of Random Matrix Theory with the Laguerre ensemble. An\nimproved version of the model, which would be a more complicated version of\nthe model in Ref. [28]\u2014because we do not have gravity to break the symmetry of\nthe system, finding the equilibrium state is more complicated\u2014can be studied\nif one is interested in how the shape and location of an eigenmode is related\nto force chains in the underlying stresses. We leave this for future work.\n\nThe random lattice model (RLM) with \\\\(128 \\times 128\\\\) sites was simulated\nin this manner, and the vibrational frequencies from 100 different\nrealizations of randomness were merged and plotted as a histogram. The ratio\nof the number of contact forces to the number of coordinate degrees of\nfreedom, which corresponds to M/N, increases with the probability of a\nparticle establishing extra bonds: from 1 at \\\\(p=0\\\\) to 1.5 at \\\\(p=1.\\\\)\n\nFig. 5\n\nHistogram of vibrational frequencies obtained from the random lattice model\ndescribed in this paper. One hundred realizations of 128x 128 random\ntriangular lattices were constructed, with the ratio M/N equal to 1.1 (top),\n1.05 (middle) and 1.0 (bottom) respectively\n\nFull size image\n\nThe results are shown in Fig. 5. When \\\\(M/N = 1,\\\\) the density of states\n\\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) is nonzero at \\\\(\\omega = 0,\\\\) in agreement with the\ndynamical simulations [38] and random matrix theory. But in addition, there is\na cusp in \\\\(\\rho (\\omega = 0)\\\\) at the transition point, as seen in the\ndynamical simulations but not in random matrix theory. (This cusp is also seen\nin some earlier mean field models [18, 27] which do not have local\ncorrelations; the random lattice model also has the advantage of being very\nsimilar to a model used successfully to explain force chains in static free-\nstanding sandpiles.) The boson peak at \\\\(\\omega \\ne 0\\\\) seen in the\nsimulations is also reproduced for the lattice model, being most pronounced at\nthe transition point.\n\nMoving away from the transition point at \\\\(M/N = 1,\\\\) there is a small gap\nin the spectrum of \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\) near \\\\(\\omega = 0.\\\\) But this is a\nfinite size effect; we have verified by increasing N while keeping M/N\nconstant that the gap decreases. This is inevitable: the global translational\ninvariance of the random lattice model with periodic boundary conditions\nensures that there are two zero modes, and the locality of the connections\nthat are made ensures that long wavelength oscillations have low frequencies.\nThus, when \\\\(N\\rightarrow \\infty \\\\) at constant M/N, the density of states\nmust scale as \\\\(\\omega ^{d-1}\\\\) for small \\\\(\\omega .\\\\) This is true in the\ndynamical simulations [38], and would be true for any local model, not just\nthe random lattice model, but it is not true for random matrix theory as seen\nin Eq. (6) with fixed M/N and \\\\(N\\rightarrow \\infty .\\\\)\n\nFig. 6\n\nCorrelation function \\\\(1 - L_2(\\xi , 0)\\\\) for the random lattice model\nintroduced in this paper (red staircase) and for the Laguerre ensemble at the\ntransition point (solid black curve). Good agreement is seen between the two.\nThe correlation function for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble is also shown\nfor comparison (dotted blue curve)\n\nFull size image\n\nWe see that the random lattice model reproduces the qualitative features of\nthe numerical density of states \\\\(\\rho (\\omega )\\\\)\u2014the cusp in \\\\(\\rho\n(\\omega )\\\\) near the origin when \\\\(M/N = 1,\\\\) the boson peak, the \\\\(\\rho\n(\\omega )\\sim \\omega ^{d-1}\\\\) scaling when \\\\(M/N > 1\\\\)\u2014that random matrix\ntheory is unable to do. In addition, as seen in Fig. 6 and in Fig. 7, the\ndistribution of spacings between consecutive frequencies is found to be the\nsame as for the random matrix ensemble, consistent with the Wigner surmise,\nand the correlation function \\\\(1 - L_2(\\xi ,0)\\\\) at \\\\(M/N = 1\\\\) matches\nthat obtained for the Laguerre ensemble. (The correlation function is not\ncompared away from the jamming transition because, as discussed earlier, it is\nindistinguishable from the GOE correlation function there.) This is what one\nwould hope, since the system is in the universality class of the Laguerre\nensemble rather than the GOE (since the dynamical matrix has the form \\\\(A^T\nA\\\\)), and any reasonable model of the system should be in the same\nuniversality class. Thus, it is reassuring that the random lattice model\nretains the positive features of random matrix theory, while curing its\nproblems.\n\nFig. 7\n\nHistogram of level spacings for the random lattice model (red) and a fit to\nthe Wigner surmise for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (solid black curve).\nSpacings from the fifth to the fifteenth normal mode frequencies are\nnormalized, as discussed in the paper, and combined to create the histogram.\nThe Wigner surmise fits the distribution very well, but as discussed in the\npaper, this applies equally to the Wigner surmise for the Laguerre ensemble\n\nFull size image\n\n## 5 Conclusions\n\nIn this paper, we show that a random matrix approach can be used successfully\nto calculate the correlations between vibrational frequencies in a granular\nsystem near the jamming transition, if the matrix ensemble is chosen\ncorrectly. By modifying the random matrices according to physical\nconsiderations, a random lattice model is constructed, which retains the\ncorrelation functions of random matrix theory and also successfully reproduces\nall the qualitative features in the density of vibrational frequencies. The\nrandom lattice model closely resembles a vector generalization of the q-model\nthat has previously been used successfully to understand the distribution of\nstress in static granular matter [1, 2, 28]. That the same model is able to\nreproduce both the static and vibrational properties of granular matter\nsuggests it may be more broadly applicable to provide a unified understanding\nof the physics of granular matter.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe models developed in this paper were compared to numerical simulations of\nthe vibrational spectrum of two-dimensional bead packs by the O\u2019Hern group\n[38]. The numerical data are compared to model predictions in Figs. 1 and 2.\nData are available from the authors upon reasonable request.\n\n## References\n\n  1. C.-H.

(A2) was already obtained after rescaling.\n\n### Level spacing distribution\n\nIn this section, we argue that the distribution of consecutive level spacings\nfor the Laguerre ensemble Eq. (A2) is indistinguishable from the GOE. To this\nend, it is useful to recall that for the GOE, Wigner showed that a very good\napproximation to the level spacing distribution can be obtained by considering\na model with just two levels. This formula, known as the Wigner surmise, is\nindistinguishable from the exact result, except in the tails of the\ndistribution where, in any case, the weight is negligible, making the\ndistinction irrelevant for applications. Intuitively Wigner\u2019s surmise works\nbecause at small spacing the distribution is dominated by the interaction\nbetween the two consecutive levels; the other levels that are neglected in the\nanalysis only matter at large spacings. In the same spirit, we consider the\ndistribution Eq. (A2) for the case \\\\(M = N = 2\\\\). We define \\\\(\\Delta =\n\\omega _1 - \\omega _2\\\\) as the spacing and \\\\(\\omega = \\frac{1}{2} (\\omega _1\n+ \\omega _2)\\\\) as the mean energy of the two levels, and we take \\\\(\\omega _1\n> \\omega _2\\\\). For a fixed \\\\(\\omega \\\\), the level spacing distribution is\nthen given by\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} p ( \\Delta ) \\propto \\Delta \\exp \\left[ - \\frac{1}{4} \\Delta\n^2 \\right] . \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(B1)\n\nfor \\\\(0< \\Delta < 2 \\omega \\\\) and \\\\(p = 0\\\\) for \\\\(\\Delta > 2 \\omega \\\\).\nThe normalization factor is easily determined by imposing\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} N(\\omega ) \\int _0^{2 \\omega } d \\Delta \\; \\Delta\n\\exp \\left( - \\frac{\\Delta ^2}{4} \\right) = 1 \\nonumber \\\\\\\\{} & {} \\quad\n\\Rightarrow N( \\omega ) = \\frac{1}{2 [ 1 - \\exp ( - \\omega ^2 ) ]}.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n(B2)\n\nIt is possible to work out \\\\(\\overline{\\Delta }(\\omega )\\\\) the mean value of\n\\\\(\\Delta \\\\) in closed form. We obtain\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\overline{\\Delta } (\\omega )= & {} \\int _0^{2 \\omega } d\n\\Delta \\; \\Delta p (\\Delta ) \\nonumber \\\\\\= & {} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi } \\;\n{{\\,\\textrm{Erf}\\,}}(\\omega ) - 2 \\omega \\exp ( - \\omega ^2) }{1 - \\exp ( -\n\\omega ^2 )} \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(B3)\n\nWe now define a rescaled level spacing \\\\(\\delta = \\Delta / \\overline{\\Delta\n(\\omega )}\\\\) which has mean unity. The probability density function \\\\(\\rho\n\\\\) for \\\\(\\delta \\\\) is given by\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\rho ( \\delta ) = \\frac{ [ \\overline{\\Delta } (\\omega ) ]^2\n}{2 [ 1 - \\exp ( - \\omega ^2 ) ] } \\delta \\exp \\left[ - \\frac{ \\overline{\n\\Delta }^2}{4} \\delta ^2 \\right] \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(B4)\n\nfor \\\\( 0 \\le \\delta \\le 2 \\omega / \\overline{\\Delta }\\\\) and \\\\(\\rho (\\delta\n) = 0 \\\\) for \\\\(\\delta > 2 \\omega / \\overline{\\Delta }\\\\).\n\nThe parameter \\\\(\\omega \\\\) is a measure of how close the two consecutive\nlevels are to the edge; to be precise \\\\(\\int _0^\\omega d \\Omega R_1 (\\Omega\n)\\\\) is the ordinal number of the pair whose spacing distribution is being\nconsidered; here, \\\\(R_1\\\\) is the mean density of states corresponding to the\ndistribution in Eq. (A2). It is easy to verify that the distribution\napproaches the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble as \\\\(\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty\n\\\\). More surprisingly and perhaps disappointingly we find that for pairs of\nlevels that are quite near to zero frequency also the Gaussian orthogonal\nensemble is a good approximation. This means that in testing whether the\nspectrum of jammed granular matter is described by random matrix theory, we\ncannot use the level spacing to distinguish between our model and the Gaussian\northogonal ensemble.\n\nBecause the Wigner surmise is not exact, we have tested it by directly\nsimulating the Laguerre random matrix ensemble. We generated an ensemble of\nten thousand \\\\(M \\times N\\\\) random matrices A with \\\\(M = N = 100\\\\). The\nmatrix elements were drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and\nunit variance. We then evaluated the eigenvalues, \\\\(\\omega _i^2\\\\) of \\\\(A^T\nA\\\\). A histogram of the spacing between the fifth and sixth levels, \\\\(\\omega\n_6 - \\omega _5\\\\), in the ten thousand different realizations, was plotted\n(see Fig. 8). The spacings were scaled to have unit mean. The Wigner surmise\nfor the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (and the Laguerre ensemble) was found to\nbe an excellent fit to the numerical data, confirming the analysis above.\n\nFig. 8\n\nHistogram of the spacing \\\\(\\omega _6 - \\omega _5\\\\), between the fifth and\nsixth frequencies for an ensemble of 10,000 spectra drawn from the Laguerre\nensemble as described in the text. The spacings have been rescaled so that\ntheir mean value is one. The solid black curve is the Wigner surmise for the\nGaussian orthogonal ensemble which is indistinguishable from the Wigner\nsurmise for the Laguerre ensemble, at the resolution of this plot\n\nFull size image\n\nIt is possible to derive an exact expression for the level spacing\ndistribution using the technology of quaternion determinants developed by\nDyson [39] and Mehta [20] and generalized to the Laguerre ensemble by Nagao\nand Slevin [25]. This analysis would allow a more careful study of the tails\nof the distribution where it might deviate from the simple approximation\nderived here. Such an analysis is not needed for the application considered in\nthis paper but is of intrinsic mathematical interest and we will return to it\nelsewhere.\n\n### Correlations of the Laguerre ensemble\n\nNagao and Slevin [25] have shown that the correlations for the Laguerre\nensemble can be computed by rewriting the distribution as a quaternion\ndeterminant and performing the required integrals using a powerful\ngeneralization of a theorem by Dyson [39]. Here, we summarize their results,\ntaking the opportunity to correct some typos in their paper, and to present\nthe results in a form that does not require the reader to have familiarity\nwith the specialized language of quaternion determinants or Pfaffians.\n\nWe start by defining the unfolding function\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\xi (x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int _0^x d t \\; \\left[ t J_1^2 (t) -\nt J_0 (t) J_2 (t) + J_0(t) J_1 (t) \\right] . \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(C1)\n\nNote that the order of the Bessel function in the first term of the integrand\nabove is given incorrectly in Ref. [25].\n\nNext we define\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} r(x) = \\sqrt{ J_1^2 (x) + \\frac{1}{2} J_0^2 (x) -\n\\frac{1}{2} J_0 (x) J_2 (x) } \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(C2)\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{C} (x, x^\\prime ) = 2 \\frac{x J_1 (x) J_0 (x^\\prime\n) - x^\\prime J_0 (x) J_1 (x^\\prime ) }{(x-x^\\prime )(x + x^\\prime )} -\n\\frac{J_0(x) J_1(x^\\prime )}{x^\\prime }. \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(C3)\n\nIn terms of these functions, one can write down\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} S (\\xi , \\xi ^\\prime ) = \\frac{1}{r(x) r(x^\\prime )}\n\\mathcal{C} (x, x^\\prime ) \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(C4)\n\nwhere it is understood that x is short for \\\\(x(\\xi )\\\\) and \\\\(x^\\prime \\\\)\nfor \\\\(x (\\xi ^\\prime )\\\\), the inverse of the function given by Eq. (C1). We\nalso write\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} I (\\xi , \\xi ^\\prime ) = \\frac{1}{r(x) r(x^\\prime )} \\left[\n\\int _{x^\\prime }^x d t \\; \\frac{t}{2} \\mathcal{C}(x, t) - \\theta (x -\nx^\\prime ) + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(C5)\n\nwhere \\\\(\\theta \\\\) denotes the unit step function and\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} D (\\xi , \\xi ^\\prime ) = \\frac{2}{ x r(x) r(x^\\prime )}\n\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x} \\mathcal{C}(x, x^\\prime ); \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(C6)\n\nthe variable of integration and the arguments of the integrand in Eq. (C5) are\ngiven incorrectly in Ref. [25] (Fig. 9).\n\nFig. 9\n\nPlot of the correlation function for the Laguerre ensemble (solid curve) and\nthe GOE (dotted curve). The blue (solid) histogram is the correlation function\nfor an ensemble of 1000 spectra drawn from the Laguerre ensemble generated as\ndescribed in the previous section. The red (dashed) histogram is the same but\nfor a bigger ensemble of 10,000 spectra. Comparison of the two reveals that\nthe departure of the numerical correlation from the exact analytic result is\ndue in part to the finite bin width (which is the same in both cases) but in\npart also due to the finite size of the ensemble used to estimate the\ncorrelation. The exact analytic result for the Laguerre ensemble is shown as a\nsmooth black curve; the dotted black curve is the correlation function for the\nGaussian orthogonal ensemble\n\nFull size image\n\nWith these definitions established, we can now write down the principal result\nof Nagao and Slevin [25], namely\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} 1 - L_2 (\\xi _1, \\xi _2 )= & {} S (\\xi _1, \\xi _2) S ( \\xi\n_2, \\xi _1 ) + \\frac{1}{2} I (\\xi _1, \\xi _2 ) D ( \\xi _2, \\xi _1 ) \\nonumber\n\\\\\\\\{} & {} + \\frac{1}{2} I (\\xi _2, \\xi _1 ) D (\\xi _1,\\xi _2 ).\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n(C7)\n\nWe are interested in \\\\(1 - L_2 (\\xi , 0)\\\\). For this special case, we obtain\nthe simplifications\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} S(\\xi , 0 )= & {} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{r(x)}\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\nJ_0 (x) + J_2 (x) \\right] , \\nonumber \\\\\\ S( 0, \\xi )= & {}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{r(x)} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} J_0 (x) + \\frac{1}{2} J_2 (x) \\right]\n, \\nonumber \\\\\\ I (\\xi , 0)= & {} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{r(x)} \\left[ \\int _0^x dt\\;\n\\frac{t}{2} \\mathcal{C} (x, t) - \\frac{1}{2} \\right] , \\nonumber \\\\\\ I (0, \\xi\n)= & {} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{r(x)} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} J_0 (x)\\right] ,\\nonumber \\\\\\\nD (\\xi , 0)= & {} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{r(x)} \\left[ \\frac{1}{6} J_2 (x) +\n\\frac{1}{6} J_4 (x) \\right] , \\nonumber \\\\\\ \\rho ( 0, \\xi )= & {} - \\rho (\\xi\n, 0 ). \\end{aligned}$$\n\n(C8)\n\nEquations (C7) and (C8) are the principal results needed for our test of the\nrandom matrix model. As shown in this paper, the histogram of the vibrational\nfrequencies from the numerical simulations agrees with the correlation\nfunction for the Laguerre ensemble, but not the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble\n(Fig. 9). The deviation from the histogram for large \\\\(\\xi \\\\) is consistent\nwith the error bars, and is also consistent with the deviations that are seen\nif a histogram is obtained by simulating the Laguerre ensemble 1000 times.\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
