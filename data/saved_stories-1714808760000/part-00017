The project consists\nof two interrelated digital undertakings: (1) a database of time-stamped film\nscenes with their corresponding global coordinates, and (2) an interactive\nmapping website and app that represent this data.\n\nThe film database draws on important information about each film, such as\nsynopses, genre, dates of production and release, and crew. CineMAP will\nenable anyone (from students and scholars of film studies, urban development,\nand geography to film buffs and tourists) to produce various interactive maps\nvisualizing the data. One could, for instance, be able to produce maps that\nshow in what parts of which cities the majority of New Wave films were shot;\nor when mountains become important markers of nation in film history; or in\nwhich fictional genres filmed locations more often correspond directly to\ndepicted locations. CineMAP will thus be the first research tool to\ncrystallize the interconnectedness of cinema and space via a clear\nvisualization.\n\nCineMAP JAPAN Beta is an interactive visualization tool for Japanese films\nshot on location. Based on a vast database of geotagged film locations of\nfilms shot both in Japan and around the world by Japanese film producers or in\nthe Japanese language, CineMAP enables researchers, fans, and tourists to\nexamine the real places recorded on and refracted through film. This beta\ninstantiation of CineMAP will make public for the first time the database as a\nmeans for visualizing the places of Japanese film.\n\nCineMAP collaborators are particularly grateful to the following project\nsponsors:\n\n  * Penn State University, Center for Humanities and Information\n\n  * Penn State University, College of Arts and Science, Teaching Innovation Project (TIP)\n\n  * University of Wisconsin, Madison, Center for East Asian Studies\n\n  * Japan Past & Present, Yanai Initiative for Globalizing Japanese Humanities\n\n  * Northeast Asia Council (NEAC), Association for Asian Studies\n\nGet the latest from JPP sent straight to your inbox.\n\n\u00a9 2023 Japan Past & Present, all rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
