In 2003, Second Life\nlaunched and included as a critical feature a digital currency designed to\nenable people building digital goods in the rapidly growing world to trade\nthem with each other. Over the last 20 years, tens of billions of dollars have\nchanged hands there, and as a result I/we got a crash course in how money\nactually works. As a result, I think about money a lot. I\u2019m currently in the\nprocess of building a new kind of digital currency, built on many of the\ndiscoveries we made trying to help avatars from all over the world buy and\nsell things from each other in a way that was generally regarded as fair.\n\n\u201cTrust\u201d is a word that is thrown around liberally in the discussion of money -\nit is even printed on our bills. Crypto uses it in reference to software...\n\u201cin code we trust\u201d. But the sort of trust I am talking about in this essay is\nthe human, personal \u201cI trust you\u201d kind. A concrete example would be when you\npay for a friend\u2019s lunch, trusting that they will pay for yours next time. So\nif you trust your friend, you buy them lunch.\n\nCryptocurrency is interesting in that it started with the premise \u201cno one can\ntrust anyone\u201d. As a side note: this was certainly an understandable\nperspective, given that it was immediately after a financial disaster in which\nUS banks stole hundreds of billions of dollars and homes from helpless US\ncitizens, perpetuating a global financial crisis for which they did not take\nresponsibility and in the end actually profited from. But I digress.\n\nRather than trusting the government (or anyone else) to print money, Bitcoin\nbegan with the premise that you must trust no one. The goal was to provided a\nfairer, people-powered alternative to a broken system (US Dollars), but how\ncould they be distributed in a better way? Trusting no one, Bitcoin\u2019s designer\nwas faced with a problem: How do you give out bitcoins?\n\nInstead of agreeing on some initial allocation (which would have required some\nsort of trust - minimally that each person created only one account), the\ndesigners opted to create a contest where a fixed number of bitcoins would be\ngradually given out to the people with the fastest computers. This is fair and\nsensible the same way having little kids arm-wrestle over who gets the larger\nslice of pie for dessert is fair: It isn\u2019t.\n\nAllocating bitcoins by computing power might at first seem vaguely\negalitarian, since most people (or at least \u201cwealthier people in western\ncountries\u201d) have a good desktop computer, don\u2019t they? So its sort of like\ngiving out the coins equally to people with computers, right? But now consider\nthat this process of giving out coins is going to go on over a lengthy period\nof time, and you realize something: The person who gets more bitcoins early in\nthe contest will re-invest their money in more computers, giving them even\nmore bitcoins, and so on.\n\nAnd after all the fighting is over and all the coins are given out, who will\nhave won? Why the one with the most money at the start, of course! This was\nthe person who has the greatest excess cash to buy their mining computers at\nthe earliest possible moment, and further able to fully re-invest their\nprofits in new computers. So what we actually ended up with is a very unequal\ndistribution of bitcoins to a small number of people.\n\nAh you say, but what if you are using Ethereum? It\u2019s different, right? Nope -\nsame problem. To their credit, Ethereum developers recognized early on that\n\u201cproof-of-work\u201d devolves over time to \u201cgive the money to the richest person\u201d.\nAnd so the Ethereum designers switched over to a strategy called \u201cproof-of-\nstake\u201d which is a fancy term for saying \u201ceveryone put money in a hat, and we\nwill give the new coins out in proportion to how much money you have in the\nhat\u201d. This approach very directly gives the money to the wealthiest people,\nbut without the extra environmental impact of also playing the bitcoin\ncomputer-power-gambling game. So Ethereum is an improvement with respect to\nenvironmental impact, but not to fairness. The money still goes directly to a\nsmall number of rich people.\n\nBut you might be thinking \u201cover time, things even out, right?\u201d. Actually, they\ndon\u2019t. Strangely and unfortunately, free market trading always increases\nwhatever initial inequality exists in a distribution... or as they say \u201cthe\nrich get richer\u201d. The mathematics of this are complex and fascinating enough\nthat myself and many others have written extensively about it. In a nutshell,\nthings don\u2019t even out over time, even if everyone is well-intentioned and\nequally valuable to each other.\n\nSo the first and biggest way cryptocurrency prices distrust is by this\nprofoundly inequitable distribution. If we aspire to have Bitcoin be a great\nequalizer here to serve all humanity (as we should), you would expect that\neach living person (about 8 billion of us) would have a roughly fair share of\nthem - and in fact at today\u2019s price we\u2019d each have about 140 dollars worth.\nBut we don\u2019t - the distribution of bitcoins is even more unequal than the\ndistribution of dollars, and only getting worse.\n\nA second way cryptocurrency prices distrust is the fees associated with\ntransactions. Because no one trusts anyone, everyone has to keep an exact copy\nof all the payments that have ever been made, so that when someone tries to\ncheat, everyone else can catch them. Having everyone keep a full copy of all\nthe records makes the system very expensive to run, which is expressed in the\nhigh transaction fees that one has to pay to make a payment. Worse yet, these\nfee are fixed and therefore regressive - meaning those with less money\nshoulder a larger portion of the burden.\n\nA third way that cryptocurrency prices distrust is in lost passwords. Because\nyou can\u2019t trust anyone (no banks or governments or even friends to help you),\nyou have to keep your password safe and not lose it. But humans do lose\nthings, and it is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of all bitcoin has\nalready been lost in this way. That a pretty high tax on people who hate\ntaxes! And it\u2019s your aging parents who need it the most that are going to lose\ntheirs first. I guess a silver lining for inequality could be that when people\ndie they are probably less likely to be able to transfer BTC to their kids - a\nkind of higher effective inheritance tax.\n\nWith respect to distrust, cryptocurrencies and gold are actually quite\nsimilar. As King Midas discovered, coveting and hoarding gold as the only\nmeans of trade comes at a high price to yourself and everyone around you. And\nin fact - contrary to what most of us were taught in school - when gold was\nused over most of history for trade it was not to trade with neighbors or even\nwith neighboring villages. It was mostly used by traveling merchants visiting\nfaraway lands, as a commodity of last resort. Even though it was hard to get\nand not widely distributed (like bitcoin), everyone felt that gold was worth\nsomething. But having to fall back to gold for trade meant that you first had\nto exchange your goods or labor to get some of the gold. If gold wasn\u2019t widely\navailable for mining in your area, or held by a miserly king, you might find\nit very expensive to get ahold of some. In this regard the crypto bros and the\ngold miners and the bankers are the same - they are the ones you have to turn\nto if you can\u2019t trust anyone else.\n\nBut what is the better alternative when you actually can trust the people you\nare trading with? Just like your friend at lunch, if you can trust a group of\nother people, you can create a token currency with them. In the case of lunch\nwith a friend you basically just keep a simple ledger in your head - with an\nentry something like \u201cLast time, I bought Alice a sandwich and a beer\u201d. But\nyou can do this with a larger group and written ledgers in a similar way.\nImagine a shared google sheet among a large group of friends, with a bunch of\nentries like \u201cPhilip paid Alice $40 for advice\u201d, \u201cAlice paid Bob $100 for\ntennis shoes\u201d, \u201cBob paid Philip $40 for lunch\u201d, and so on. You can total up\nthe balance of each person as the sum of what they\u2019ve received minus the sum\nof what they\u2019ve paid to others. If anyone goes too negative, the community can\nwarn them to get a job (or otherwise transfer more value to others), or even\nstop trading with them. In this way, you can have a money system without gold,\nor banks, or bitcoins... basically a bunch of IOUs that are passed around.\n\nIs the idea of a trust-based currency some weird utopian thing dreamed up by\ntechies? While the banks and bitcoin holders might want you to think so, it\nturns out that economies based on trust and IOUs are the most common\nhistorical systems, far pre-dating the emergence of gold coins or \u2018fiat\u2019\ncurrencies issued by governments. If you want to learn more about the various\ntypes of trust-backed currencies, start with this Wikipedia entry on Mutual\nCredit.\n\nSo, in summary, trust can be used directly as a basis for an economic system\nwhose cost to participants are lower than when using gold (or bitcoins). Trust\ncan be converted into money. And perhaps that was the deeper meaning of the\nstory of Midas.\n\n### Subscribe to Philip\u2019s Newsletter\n\nBy Philip Rosedale \u00b7 Launched 3 years ago\n\nVirtual worlds and thoughts on things\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Price of Distrust\n\nphiliprosedale.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nWhy do The Rich Get Richer?\n\nIt is easy to think that government or policy choices cause the rich get\nricher, but that's not the reason.
