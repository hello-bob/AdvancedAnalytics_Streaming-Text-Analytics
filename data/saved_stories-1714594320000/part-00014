His echo is still heard today.\n\n  * By Grigori Guitchounts\n  * April 30, 2024\n\n  * Add a comment\n  * Share\n\nFacebook Twitter Pocket Reddit Email\n\nExplore\n\nOn a summer evening in 1959, as the sun dipped below the horizon of the Moscow\nskyline, Rudolf Zaripov was ensconced in a modest dormitory at Moscow State\nUniversity. Zaripov had just defended his Ph.D. in physics at Rostov\nUniversity in southern Russia, when he was sent to Moscow to program one of\nthe country\u2019s early mainframe computers and train a new generation of\nprogrammers for military projects.\n\nThe small room in Sparrow Hills\u2014one of the seven hills on which the city was\nfounded\u2014was a crucible of creativity for Zaripov. Working on state-sanctioned\ncryptography projects by day, Zaripov chipped away at an algorithm for musical\ncomposition on the computer by night, determined to translate the elusive\nlanguage of music into the rigid syntax of mathematical commands.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nZaripov\u2019s foray into algorithmic composition had begun in 1947, when he was\n18. In high school, he studied music and played the cello, though he also\nloved math and physics. His classmate, Bulat Galeev, remembered Zaripov as\nkind. \u201cBy nature, he was a very gentle person, and this was often abused by\nthose who liked to skip lectures.\u201d Zaripov would cover for his friends\u2019\nabsences, which led the dean to remove him from his post as \u201chead boy.\u201d\n\nREBEL COMPOSER: Russian Rudolf Zaripov developed an algorithm for musical\ncomposition on the computer in the 1950s\u2014a very dangerous time to be working\non projects that linked computer and human systems.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nOne day, preparing for a music exam, Zaripov observed that the patterns of\nharmonization of a melody could be described by mathematical rules.\n\n\u201cHe figured out several ways to calculate chords and realized that this task\nwas accessible to any calculating machine,\u201d wrote Gleb Anfilov in a 1962 book,\nPhysics and Music. \u201cBut then another thought flashed across the inquisitive\nyoung man\u2019s mind: What if we tried to calculate not only chords, but also the\nmost important component of music\u2014the melody? After all, melodies also obey\nlaws. And their laws can probably also be expressed mathematically!\u201d\n\nAt that time, the Soviet political apparatus had engulfed science. Work on any\nproject that linked computer and human systems\u2014then known as the field of\ncybernetics\u2014was anathema to Soviet philosophy. Cybernetics was viewed as a\nweapon of the capitalistic West, a bourgeois pseudoscience and a powerful tool\nthat threatened to leave human workers behind.\n\nBy the late 1950s, though, Soviet restrictions on cybernetics had softened,\nand Zaripov was working in a less fearful climate. In a late hour of that\nsummer night in 1959, as he punched codes into the lumbering Ural computer,\nwith its blinking lights and whirring tapes, Zaripov heard the sound he had\nbeen pursuing for years. His algorithm worked! His \u201cUral Chants\u201d emerged from\nthe computer like an eerie, even beautiful, organ rendition of early sacred\nmusic.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIt was an incredible achievement for the 30-year-old scientist and musician.\nThe music he generated behind the Iron Curtain echoes today in debates over\nthe value of music and art generated by AI. And there\u2019s no false note about\nit: Zaripov was thinking about artificial intelligence in a dangerous time.\n\nThe field of cybernetics nominally relates to problems of control and the use\nof feedback signals to guide computational processes. It\u2019s the brainchild of\nthe American computer scientist Norbert Wiener (although, as is often true,\nthese ideas had been floating around at the time, and were based on earlier\nwork).\n\nWiener\u2019s 1948 book, Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal\nand the Machine, was a treatise on ideas he first came across while working on\nmilitary technologies during WWII, using feedback mechanisms to improve the\naim of weapons. Wiener saw applications of the principles of feedback systems\npractically everywhere, and expanded them to encompass biological, economic,\npolitical, psychological, and social systems. This breadth was one of the\nissues the Soviets latched onto: How could one system explain everything?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nMIT historian Slava Gerovitch writes in his 2002 book on Soviet cybernetics\nthat Wiener was damned by his reference to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\nbook, What Is Life?, was translated into Russian the same year that Zaripov\nfirst contemplated algorithmic composition, 1947. What Is Life? came to be\nhighly regarded in the West for its theoretical description of the chemical\nmakeup of genetic material. (Francis Crick cited it as an inspiration.)\n\n> Cybernetics was a weapon of the capitalistic West, a bourgeois\n> pseudoscience.\n\nThe Soviet animosity came from the fact that, starting in the 1930s, genetics\nwas vilified as Western propaganda, due to the efforts of Trofim Lysenko, an\nuneducated but politically well-placed proponent of Lamarckian evolution.\nLysenko\u2019s ideas on how crops could quickly adapt to harsh winters led to\nfamine and mass starvation. Lysenko believed that biology should conform to\nSoviet ideology, under which adaptability and strength were more patriotic\nthan the fate of inheritance. \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s defense of the chromosome theory\nbrought the authority of modern physics explicitly to the geneticists\u2019 side,\nand this immediately made him a mortal enemy of the Lysenkoites,\u201d Gerovitch\nwrites.\n\nThe attacks on cybernetics were relentless in the 1950s. Soviet journalist\nBoris Agapov mocked Mark III, the Harvard computer, listed Wiener among the\n\u201ccharlatans and obscurantists, whom capitalists substitute for genuine\nscientists,\u201d and called the computer hype in the United States a \u201cgiant-scale\ncampaign of mass delusion of ordinary people.\u201d Another article claimed, \u201cthese\nfabrications of the learned lackeys of imperialism have nothing in common with\nscience and only testify to the degeneration of modern bourgeois science.\u201d In\n1953, an anonymous author in the Soviet journal, Problems of Philosophy,\nwrote, \u201cWe will be left with computers of perfect technical design, \u2018giant\nbrains\u2019 that will control all other machines ... The need for workers will\ndisappear.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThey say that science progresses one funeral at a time. The funeral that\nrocketed cybernetics from pseudoscience to a subject worthy of investigation\nin the Soviet Union was Stalin\u2019s. The Soviet ruler had a lot to say about\nscience, writing on philosophy, linguistics, economics, and even physiology\nand physics, despite having no formal education in these topics. That of\ncourse didn\u2019t stop him from dictating the practice of science. In Stalin and\nthe Soviet Science Wars, Ethan Pollock writes that Stalin was called \u201cthe\ncoryphaeus\u201d\u2014leader of the Greek chorus\u2014\u201cof science.\u201d After Stalin\u2019s death,\nthings for cybernetics researchers became easier. By 1955, mathematician\nAlexey Lyapunov, who had close ties with leading Soviet scientists in the\n1940s, was conducting an official seminar at Moscow State University on\ncybernetics and physiology.\n\nThe idea of algorithmic music wasn\u2019t Zaripov\u2019s alone. It can be traced to the\nvisionary 19th-century mathematician Ada Lovelace, who envisioned in the 1840s\nthat music could be captured with mathematical rules and composed with a\nmachine. Nor was Zaripov the first to compose on a computer. In 1957, the\nAmerican composers Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson created the \u201cIlliac\nSuite.\u201d The duo used the Illiac computer\u2014which was composed of 2,800 vacuum\ntubes, not much higher than the Ural 1\u2019s 2,100, which Zaripov used for his\nwork\u2014to create a string quartet through algorithmic methods.\n\nZaripov, though, was the first to publish an academic paper on algorithmic\ncomposition, published in 1960 in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences\nof the USSR. The paper describes the painstaking rules of melody that Zaripov\nhad to articulate in mathematical language for the computer to follow: Each\nmusical phrase must end on one of the three main notes of the scale; two large\nintervals (a fifth or a sixth) are not allowed in a row; the number of notes\nmoving in one direction (up or down in pitch) must not exceed six, and so on.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nDespite the apparent rigidity of the rules, one of the reasons \u201cUral Chants\u201d\nengages listeners is that Zaripov had the mind of a musician. In the 1970s, he\nconducted experiments broadcast over the radio. He played listeners a series\nof melodies he generated on a computer along with similar melodies played by\nprofessional musicians. Often, listeners preferred the computer melodies.\n\n\u201cZaripov was drawn to questions of aesthetics and taste,\u201d says Ianina\nPrudenko, a Ukranian culturologist and author of Cybernetics in the Humanities\nand Arts in the USSR. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that he was a \u2018dry mathematician\u2019 who did\nnot care what effect algorithmic music had on perception.\u201d\n\n> On that summer night, Zaripov heard the sound he had been pursuing for\n> years.\n\nElements of Zaripov\u2019s simple algorithms exist in the sophisticated algorithms\nthat would follow, such as David Cope\u2019s Experiments in Musical Intelligence\nProject, developed in the 1980s, which uses AI to analyze music styles, like\nthose of Bach and Mozart, and compose new works in those styles, pushing the\nboundaries of creative AI applications in music composition.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nRecent incarnations of the composing computer have relied on advances in deep\nlearning and neural networks. These modern approaches typically use a\ntransformer architecture\u2014the same neural network as ChatGPT and other large\nlanguage models\u2014trained to fill in blanks in a vast corpus of music\nrepresented in the MIDI format, a digital language for musical notation. These\napproaches take human language descriptions of music as input, and generate\noutputs based on their statistical learning of the structure of music in their\ntraining data.\n\nFor all the advances in technology, though, the specter of the giant machine\nbrain hovering over humanity is still with us. John Supko, a composer and\nprofessor of music at Duke University, is no Luddite. Supko has created and\nused computational tools for composition, but his experience with music LLMs\nhas left him disheartened.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely dispiriting to open Twitter and see the deployment of\npowerful technology like ChatGPT to create music that sounds like schlock,\u201d\nSupko says. \u201cIf such music were composed by a human, it would not be worth\nlistening to. For these systems to regurgitate third-rate imitations of Bach\nand other composers is a criminal underuse of the technology.\u201d\n\nThe composer and technologist Ed Newton-Rex led a team at the startup\nStability AI that released a generative music model called Stable Audio, a\nneural network similar to OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E, which works by diffusing noise into\nstructured data, in this case, music. Newton-Rex says he started out thinking,\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if AI could generate music? And of course the answer is\nyes. It would be impressive and magical.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nBut for Newton-Rex, the magic is gone. \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where generative AI\ntoday is literally starting to impact musicians. What I\u2019m talking about is not\nsome hypothetical bad. It is definitive that AI is competing with human\ncreators.\u201d Disillusioned by Silicon Valley, Newton-Rex left Stability AI in\n2023 to found a nonprofit that certifies the source of training data for AI\nmodels.\n\nFor his part, Supko is optimistic about the ways technology can improve\ncomposition. \u201cWhen I compose music,\u201d he explains, \u201cmy inspiration is powered\nby tiny explosions of connections. I listen to see what happens when I combine\ntwo little fragments of music. I don\u2019t have a full-fledged idea of what I\u2019m\nworking toward but work with my ability to be surprised. That\u2019s what I want\nfor an audience\u2014to be surprised.\u201d\n\nSupko says he\u2019s unlikely to compose with today\u2019s generative AI, but he sees\npossible uses for it. He imagines he could take the result of generative AI\nmusic, \u201cchop it up and manipulate it as just another sample of something I\nfound in the world, and work on it in the hope of making it more interesting.\u201d\n\nWith this approach, the responsibility and intention for creating music remain\nwith the human composer. Zaripov would have likely agreed. In his 1963 book,\nCybernetics and Music, he wrote, \u201cThe machine and cybernetic methods are\npowerful aids to man in the investigation of the mysteries of nature, the\nsecrets of creativity, in the clarification of the laws and principles of\nintellectual processes.\u201d Despite the progress in AI, these laws and principles\nare still a mystery, and the art of making music remains human, for now.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
