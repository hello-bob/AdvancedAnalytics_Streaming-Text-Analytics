Credit: K. Morimoto et al./bioRxiv\n\nSurgeons in Japan have transplanted kidney tissue from one rat fetus to\nanother, while the recipient was still in its mother's womb. Study lead\nTakashi Yokoo, a nephrologist at Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo,\nsays the surgery is the first step to one day transplanting fetal pig kidneys\ninto human fetuses that develop without functioning kidneys.\n\n\u201cOur project is the first of its kind,\u201d says Yokoo. Researchers have\npreviously injected cells and amniotic fluid into fetuses^1, including human\nones, but these are the first reports of organ and tissue transplants in\nutero, he says.\n\nTransplanting an organ before birth could allow it to grow and develop with\nthe fetus, so that the organ is functioning at birth and has less risk of\nrejection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely data,\u201d says Glenn Gardener, a fetal surgeon at Mater Mothers\u2019\nHospital in Brisbane, Australia.\n\n## Green kidneys\n\nIn their study, Yokoo and his colleagues genetically modified rats to express\na green fluorescent protein in their kidneys, so that the tissue could be\ntracked. They then extracted the green kidney tissue from rat fetuses, and\nused a tiny needle to insert it under the skin in the backs of 18-day-old rat\nfetuses developing in their mothers\u2019 wombs. The rat pups were born after the\nnormal gestation period of around 22 days.\n\nThe tissue gradually developed, forming waste-filtering units known as\nglomeruli and well-divided inner and outer kidney structures. Two-and-a-half\nweeks later, the kidneys began to produce urine. \u201cThe timeline is considered\nto be almost identical to normal development,\u201d says Yokoo. But because the\ntransplanted kidney was not connected to the ureter, the urine had nowhere to\ngo, so the researchers drained the kidney continuously until the rats were\neuthanized at around five months.\n\nOf the nine fetuses surgically transplanted in four pregnant rats, eight\ndeveloped fluorescent-green kidneys. In the ninth fetus, the transplanted\ntissue probably did not embed successfully, says Yokoo.\n\nA close look at the kidneys revealed that the fetuses\u2019 blood vessels had grown\ninside the donated tissue, which made them less likely to be rejected by the\nimmune system. A major cause of organ-transplant rejection is incompatibility\nbetween donor blood vessels and the host\u2019s body, says Gardener. \u201cIn this case,\nthe host is infiltrating the organ, and you overcome that. That was really\ncool.\u201d\n\nThe rat study results^2 were posted on the bioRxiv preprint server on 20 April\nand have not yet been peer reviewed.\n\n## Pig, monkey, human\n\nYokoo\u2019s long-term goal is to transplant fetal pig kidneys into human fetuses\nwith Potter syndrome, a condition in which the unborn infant doesn\u2019t develop\nfunctioning kidneys and usually dies hours after birth.\n\nTo test xenotransplantation \u2014 the use of animal organs in recipients of\nanother species \u2014 Yokoo transplanted mouse kidney tissue into rat fetuses. The\nintervention was successful in four rats, and the kidneys developed for ten\ndays without being rejected. By 18 days, the tissue showed signs of rejection,\nwhich could be quelled by immunosuppressant drugs. Yokoo says fetal tissue is\nless likely to induce an immune response than is adult tissue, which means\nthat it does not need to be genetically modified before transplant to avoid\nrejection.\n\nSo far, researchers have attempted to genetically modify fully developed\norgans to bring xenotransplantation closer to the clinic. Last month, surgeons\nin the United States conducted the first transplant of a kidney from gene-\nedited pigs into a living adult. Surgeons in the United States and China have\npreviously transplanted gene-modified pig hearts into living people, and gene-\nedited pig kidneys and a liver into people who lacked brain function.\n\nYokoo says he has also conducted pig-to-pig fetal transplants in 38 pig\nfetuses in 11 sows, and 18 recipient piglets were born. These results have not\nbeen published. He is also conducting pig-to-monkey fetal transplants in\nmarmosets, and hopes to start work on cynomolgus macaques (Macaca\nfascicularis) in a few months.\n\nYokoo\u2019s rat experiments are a \u201csmall first step, but a very important one\u201d on\nthe path to xenotransplantation in people in Japan, says Maria Yasuoka, a\nmedical anthropologist who studies organ transplantation at Otaru University\nof Commerce in Hokkaido, Japan.\n\nGardener says the results in rats are fascinating but still a long way from\nbeing applicable to humans. Other researchers agree: \u201cIn principle, the\nprospect of organ transplantation in utero is an amazing concept,\u201d says Ahmet\nBaschat, a specialist in fetal interventions at Johns Hopkins University in\nBaltimore, Maryland. \u201cScientifically, it\u2019s novel. It\u2019s a beginning.\u201d But,\nBaschat says he wouldn\u2019t get too excited yet.\n\nYokoo has started engaging with members of the public to inform them of the\nbenefits of human fetal xenotransplantation and gain their trust. He plans to\napply for approval to conduct research in people from ethics boards at his\nuniversity and hospital, and Japan\u2019s regulatory agency.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01152-y\n\n## References\n\n  1.
