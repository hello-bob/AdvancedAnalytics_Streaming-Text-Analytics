McGee argues that airline deregulation in the United States has not\ndelivered on its promised benefits of lower fares, increased safety, and more\ncompetition, but instead has led to industry consolidation, regional\ninequality, and degradation of passenger rights. McGee proposes a suite of\npolicy recommendations to address these issues, including measures to expand\ngeographic networks, increase airport access, encourage new entrants, simplify\npricing, and improve passenger rights, labor, and safety standards.\n\nThere was a time not that long ago when using the \u201cr-word\u201d\u2014as in\n\u201cregulation\u201d\u2014was taboo in many airline circles. The Airline Deregulation Act\nof 1978\u2014which removed the Civil Aeronautics Board from overseeing \u201croutes,\nrates, and service\u201d by setting schedules and fares\u2014ended four decades of CAB\nauthority. Over the last 46 years, proponents of deregulation have touted its\nsupposed delivery of low prices, a growing number of Americans flying, and\nbetter safety. Not only are those claims not verifiable, but the airline\nindustry today is characterized by limited competition, opaque and deceptive\nfees for passengers, consolidation to four main airlines, regional inequality\nwith many cities losing access to air travel, and the degradation of passenger\nrights and safety standards.\n\nThe very first sentence of the Airline Deregulation Act spoke to safety and\nthen made promises about \u201cplacing maximum reliance on competition\u201d and \u201cthe\navoidance of unreasonable industry concentration\u201d and \u201cthe encouragement of\nentry...by new air carriers.\u201d\n\nNone of this has happened. In March, I detailed in ProMarket how the United\nStates\u2019 airline industry has never been more consolidated, with the fewest\nscheduled passenger carriers ever (12); a 14 year gap (2007-2021) with no new-\nentrants at all; and an oligopoly at the top with the Big Four (American,\nDelta, Southwest, and United) controlling 80% of the market.\n\nSo, together with Ganesh Sitaraman of the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator, I co-\nauthored a recent white paper with a detailed suite of recommendations and\npolicy options to address the systemic problems with the airline industry.\n\nOur proposals do not recommend a return to the rules of airline regulation\nthat were in place prior to deregulation, such as full government control of\nprices and flight capacity. Instead, we propose changes to encourage\ncompetition in the airline industry. But first, we must understand some of the\npositive developments that took place in the era of regulation and what\nbenefits were lost when the industry was deregulated.\n\nDisputing the Myths of Deregulation\n\nThe airlines and other proponents of deregulation continually repeat a\nsupposed trinity of benefits that air travelers have enjoyed since 1978:\n1)more Americans started flying 2)airfares began falling so that flying was no\nlonger for the rich 3)air travel became safer\n\nThe only problem is that crediting deregulation for all three of these\nassertions is false. Because all three trendlines:\n\n1) began 20 years before deregulation;\n\n2) were more pronounced before rather than after 1978; and\n\n3) were driven by technological advancements that had nothing to do with\nderegulation.\n\nYet these myths persist, not in small measure because the airline industry\nconstantly repeats the \u201cderegulation has lowered fares and been a success\u201d\nmantra. In reality, deregulation has produced 45 mergers and 212\nbankruptcies\u2014and counting. Meanwhile, airlines pocket big profits in the up\ncycles, and taxpayers bail them out on the downside.\n\nLet\u2019s examine these assertions in further detail:\n\nAmericans flying more? The introduction of the first successful commercial jet\naircraft in 1958 ushered in the \u201cJet Age\u201d of safer, more reliable, more\nefficient, more economical, and more comfortable aircraft, leading to lower\ncosts, higher passenger loads, and lower airfares. Then the introduction of\nthe first widebodies in 1970 dramatically increased passenger capacity yet\nagain, and led to even lower costs and fares.\n\nConsider this chart from industry lobbyists Airlines for America that details\nhistorical surveys asking Americans if they had ever taken an airline flight;\nin 1971, 49% of Americans said they had flown. In the next eight years this\nfigure grew 16 percentage points to 65% by 1979, the first full year of\nderegulation. Yet it would take more than twice that time in the deregulated\nera\u2014until 1997, 18 years later\u2014for that number to increase another 16 points\nto 81%.\n\nNext we examine the question of whether airfares are falling. The same trend\nfrom above holds true for ticket prices. Consider this chart with data from\nAirlines for America. It shows that fares fell much further and faster in the\n19 years from 1960 to 1979 than they did in the subsequent 19 years from 1979\nto 1998.\n\nIn fact, falling airfares after 1978 were largely due to a plethora of\ntechnological improvements in aviation in the late 1970s-early 1980s that were\nunrelated to deregulation, but which drove down operating costs, making lower\nfares feasible.\n\nDoes deregulation create greater safety? There is no question that commercial\naviation is the safest form of travel, and U.S. airline\u2019s fatal accidents have\nfallen dramatically; the last 20 years are the safest in aviation history.\nHowever, a Boeing statistical summary of annual fatal accident rates in the\njet age (1959-2021) for U.S. and Canadian airlines shows the greatest\nimprovements came more than 60 years ago, when such rates plummeted between\n1959 and 1963, falling from more than 40 fatal accidents per million\ndepartures to approximately 2 per million.\n\nSince deregulation, the accident rate has continued to improve, but\nderegulation has eroded the safety net as U.S. airlines continue to skimp on\ncosts by outsourcing aircraft maintenance overseas and weakening pilot\nstandards, posing new threats. During the regulated era, when the Civil\nAeronautics Board set airfares based on costs, there was absolutely no\nincentive for airlines to cut corners on safety.\n\nProposing Fresh Ideas\n\nSo what do we mean by \u201ca new approach to regulating\u201d airlines? Our paper\ncontains quite a few recommendations that require fresh thinking. Here are a\nfew highlights:\n\nExpanding Geographic Networks. One of the worst outcomes from deregulation and\nthe resultant rise of major carrier hub-and-spoke networks is the regional\ninequality that has banished millions of Americans from easy, quick, and\naffordable access to the promise of global airline networks. Smaller and rural\ncommunities are hardest hit, so that Dubuque, Iowa and Toledo, Ohio have no\nscheduled service and Cheyenne, Wyoming must pay airlines for access. The\nairlines claim these smaller markets are more expensive to serve and under\nderegulation they would rather focus on more lucrative routes.\n\nHowever, even U.S. cities as large as Cincinnati, Cleveland, and St. Louis\nhave suffered severe economic and societal harm from airline mergers that shut\ndown hubs. In fact, Ohio lost four hubs from four different major carriers in\nfour different cities\u2014Cincinnati/Delta, Cleveland/Continental,\nColumbus/America West, Dayton/US Airways\u2014and today has no hubs at all. Or\nconsider Pittsburgh, where US Airways built up a large hub in the early 1990s\nand gradually downsized it before the operation was shut down in 2004; the\ncarrier continually reduced its presence in PIT in subsequent years, before US\nAirways eventually merged with American Airlines in 2013. At its peak,\nPittsburgh handled 21 million passengers daily in 1995, which dwindled to 8\nmillion by 2010. Nonstop flights fell from 119 destinations in 1995 to just 36\nairports by 2012. Even worse for Pittsburgh, the workforce was decimated from\na high of 12,000 to only 1,800 by 2014.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeking is what the regulated era largely delivered from 1938 to\n1978: network connectivity for all Americans spread out among many different\nairlines, but priced so that all communities are served and larger communities\nare served more frequently, as they were under regulation.. The pricing would\nbe aggregated based on network costs, as the U.S. Postal Service does, so that\nsmaller and rural communities would not pay penalties for network\nconnectivity.\n\nWe propose two possible systems to ensure continuous and reasonably priced\nservice across the country and guarantee reasonable profits for airlines to\nserve those routes:\n\n1\\. A \u201cDraft Pick\u201d system whereby the largest carriers would be mandated to\nchoose which smaller cities to serve at regulated, affordable rates. This\nlottery would allow the largest airlines to have a choice in serving all\neligible domestic markets, as deemed by the Department of Transportation\n(DOT). It also would give the majors flexibility in serving these routes via\ntheir hubs.\n\n2\\. A \u201cRegional Conference\u201d system in which Congress would designate a single\nlarge carrier to serve all communities within a given region from their larger\nmarkets. Fares on such regional flights would be regulated to prevent\nmonopolistic exploitation. This model would create a utility-like service for\nlower-volume flights but would retain competition on routes with higher\nvolumes.\n\nIncrease Airport Access. We also recommend bringing meaningful competition to\nairports and reducing fortress hub concentration by capping each carrier\u2019s\npercentage at domestic airports. Deregulation spurred the growth of such hubs,\nwhich are geographically situated to the benefit of each individual airline\u2019s\nneeds, not the larger concerns of national connectivity. Subsequently these\nhubs squelch competition, prevent new entrants from accessing such airports,\nand raise fares as well. This has led to situations such as Charlotte, where\nAmerican Airlines operates 88% of all flights, or Dallas-Fort Worth, where AA\noperates 84%. We further suggest limiting sub-leasing of takeoff and landing\nslots and call for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to align gates\nand other precious airport resources so that smaller and low cost airlines can\ngain real access.\n\nEncourage New Entrants. Not only is the airline industry concentrated, but\nconcentrated asset managers like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street own a\nlarge fraction of shares of all of the airlines. This changes the airlines\u2019\nincentives to compete with one another vigorously on price, leading to less\ncompetition and higher fares. While this is arguably already a violation of\nantitrust law today, we recommend the straightforward prohibition on investors\nfrom having more than 1% ownership in two or more U.S. airlines, following\nmodel legislation we released in 2022. This would free up capital for new-\nentrants in an extremely capital-intensive industry.\n\nSimplified and Transparent Pricing. Our paper calls on Congress to simplify\nand make fair one of the most complex pricing models of any consumer-facing\nindustry. This would entail reducing hundreds of fare classes on any given\nflight down to three, with minimum uniform standards. Furthermore, fares and\nfees should be made fully transparent regardless of the booking channel\nbecause currently, consumers may see different prices depending on XYZ\n\nFinally, we propose improvements on issues related to passenger rights, labor,\nand safety. These include eliminating foreign outsourcing of aircraft\nmaintenance; ending abusive frequent flyer program rules; funding real air\ntraffic control modernization; establishing minimum standards for aircraft\nseat sizes; protecting infants inflight; and empowering state attorneys\ngeneral with authority to enforce existing state regulations over U.S.\nairlines for the first time since 1978.\n\nArticles represent the opinions of their writers, not necessarily those of the\nUniversity of Chicago, the Booth School of Business, or its faculty.\n\n### Related posts:\n\n  1.
