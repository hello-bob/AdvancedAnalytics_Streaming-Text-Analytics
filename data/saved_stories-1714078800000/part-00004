Astronomical observations show that within such a\ndisk, mysterious flares occur up to several times a day, temporarily\nbrightening and then fading away. Now a team led by Caltech scientists has\nused telescope data and an artificial intelligence (AI) computer-vision\ntechnique to recover the first three-dimensional video showing what such\nflares could look like around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*, pronounced sadge-ay-\nstar), the supermassive black hole at the heart of our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\nThe 3D flare structure features two bright, compact features located about 75\nmillion kilometers (or half the distance between Earth and the Sun) from the\ncenter of the black hole. It is based on data collected by the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile over a period of 100 minutes directly after\nan eruption seen in X-ray data on April 11, 2017.\n\n\"This is the first three-dimensional reconstruction of gas rotating close to a\nblack hole,\" says Katie Bouman, assistant professor of computing and\nmathematical sciences, electrical engineering and astronomy at Caltech, whose\ngroup led the effort described in a new paper in Nature Astronomy.\n\nAviad Levis, a postdoctoral scholar in Bouman's group and lead author on the\nnew paper, emphasizes that while the video is not a simulation, it is also not\na direct recording of events as they took place. \"It is a reconstruction based\non our models of black hole physics. There is still a lot of uncertainty\nassociated with it because it relies on these models being accurate,\" he says.\n\nUsing AI informed by physics to figure out possible 3D structures\n\nTo reconstruct the 3D image, the team had to develop new computational imaging\ntools that could, for example, account for the bending of light due to the\ncurvature of space-time around objects of enormous gravity, such as a black\nhole.\n\nThe multidisciplinary team first considered if it would be possible to create\na 3D video of flares around a black hole in June 2021. The Event Horizon\nTelescope (EHT) Collaboration, of which Bouman and Levis are members, had\nalready published the first image of the supermassive black hole at the core\nof a distant galaxy, called M87, and was working to do the same with EHT data\nfrom Sgr A*. Pratul Srinivasan of Google Research, a co-author on the new\npaper, was at the time visiting the team at Caltech. He had helped develop a\ntechnique known as neural radiance fields (NeRF) that was then just starting\nto be used by researchers; it has since had a huge impact on computer\ngraphics. NeRF uses deep learning to create a 3D representation of a scene\nbased on 2D images. It provides a way to observe scenes from different angles,\neven when only limited views of the scene are available.\n\nThe team wondered if, by building on these recent developments in neural\nnetwork representations, they could reconstruct the 3D environment around a\nblack hole. Their big challenge: From Earth, as anywhere, we only get a single\nviewpoint of the black hole.\n\nThe team thought that they might be able to overcome this problem because gas\nbehaves in a somewhat predictable way as it moves around the black hole.\nConsider the analogy of trying to capture a 3D image of a child wearing an\ninner tube around their waist. To capture such an image with the traditional\nNeRF method, you would need photos taken from multiple angles while the child\nremained stationary. But in theory, you could ask the child to rotate while\nthe photographer remained stationary taking pictures. The timed snapshots,\ncombined with information about the child's rotation speed, could be used to\nreconstruct the 3D scene equally well. Similarly, by leveraging knowledge of\nhow gas moves at different distances from a black hole, the researchers aimed\nto solve the 3D flare reconstruction problem with measurements taken from\nEarth over time.\n\nWith this insight in hand, the team built a version of NeRF that takes into\naccount how gas moves around black holes. But it also needed to consider how\nlight bends around massive objects such as black holes. Under the guidance of\nco-author Andrew Chael of Princeton University, the team developed a computer\nmodel to simulate this bending, also known as gravitational lensing.\n\nWith these considerations in place, the new version of NeRF was able to\nrecover the structure of orbiting bright features around the event horizon of\na black hole. Indeed, the initial proof-of-concept showed promising results on\nsynthetic data.\n\nA flare around Sgr A* to study\n\nBut the team needed some real data. That's where ALMA came in. The EHT's now\nfamous image of Sgr A* was based on data collected on April 6\u20137, 2017, which\nwere relatively calm days in the environment surrounding the black hole. But\nastronomers detected an explosive and sudden brightening in the surroundings\njust a few days later, on April 11. When team member Maciek Wielgus of the Max\nPlanck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany went back to the ALMA data\nfrom that day, he noticed a signal with a period matching the time it would\ntake for a bright spot within the disk to complete an orbit around Sgr A*. The\nteam set out to recover the 3D structure of that brightening around Sgr A*.\n\nALMA is one of the most powerful radio telescopes in the world. However,\nbecause of the vast distance to the galactic center (more than 26,000 light-\nyears), even ALMA does not have the resolution to see Sgr A*'s immediate\nsurroundings. What ALMA measures are light curves, which are essentially\nvideos of a single flickering pixel, which are created by collecting all of\nthe radio-wavelength light detected by the telescope for each moment of\nobservation.\n\nRecovering a 3D volume from a single-pixel video might seem impossible.\nHowever, by leveraging an additional piece of information about the physics\nthat are expected for the disk around black holes, the team was able to get\naround the lack of spatial information in the ALMA data.\n\nStrongly polarized light from the flares provided clues\n\nALMA doesn't just capture a single light curve. In fact, it provides several\nsuch \"videos\" for each observation because the telescope records data relating\nto different polarization states of light. Like wavelength and intensity,\npolarization is a fundamental property of light and represents which direction\nthe electric component of a light wave is oriented with respect to the wave's\ngeneral direction of travel. \"What we get from ALMA is two polarized single-\npixel videos,\" says Bouman, who is also a Rosenberg Scholar and a Heritage\nMedical Research Institute Investigator. \"That polarized light is actually\nreally, really informative.\"\n\nRecent theoretical studies suggest that hot spots forming within the gas are\nstrongly polarized, meaning the light waves coming from these hot spots have a\ndistinct preferred orientation direction. This is in contrast to the rest of\nthe gas, which has a more random or scrambled orientation. By gathering the\ndifferent polarization measurements, the ALMA data gave the scientists\ninformation that could help localize where the emission was coming from in 3D\nspace.\n\nIntroducing Orbital Polarimetric Tomography\n\nTo figure out a likely 3D structure that explained the observations, the team\ndeveloped an updated version of its method that not only incorporated the\nphysics of light bending and dynamics around a black hole but also the\npolarized emission expected in hot spots orbiting a black hole. In this\ntechnique, each potential flare structure is represented as a continuous\nvolume using a neural network. This allows the researchers to computationally\nprogress the initial 3D structure of a hotspot over time as it orbits the\nblack hole to create a whole light curve. They could then solve for the best\ninitial 3D structure that, when progressed in time according to black hole\nphysics, matched the ALMA observations.\n\nThe result is a video showing the clockwise movement of two compact bright\nregions that trace a path around the black hole. \"This is very exciting,\" says\nBouman. \"It didn't have to come out this way. There could have been arbitrary\nbrightness scattered throughout the volume. The fact that this looks a lot\nlike the flares that computer simulations of black holes predict is very\nexciting.\"\n\nLevis says that the work was uniquely interdisciplinary: \"You have a\npartnership between computer scientists and astrophysicists, which is uniquely\nsynergetic. Together, we developed something that is cutting edge in both\nfields\u2014both the development of numerical codes that model how light propagates\naround black holes and the computational imaging work that we did.\"\n\nThe scientists note that this is just the beginning for this exciting\ntechnology. \"This is a really interesting application of how AI and physics\ncan come together to reveal something that is otherwise unseen,\" says Levis.\n\"We hope that astronomers could use it on other rich time-series data to shed\nlight on complex dynamics of other such events and to draw new conclusions.\"\n\nThe new paper is titled, \"Orbital Polarimetric Tomography of a Flare Near the\nSagittarius A* Supermassive Black Hole.\" The work was supported by funding\nfrom the National Science Foundation, the Carver Mead New Adventures Fund at\nCaltech, the Princeton Gravity Initiative, and the European Research Council.\n\nWritten by\n\nKimm Fesenmaier\n\nContact\n\nKimm Fesenmaier\n\n(626) 395\u20101217\n\nkfesenma@caltech.edu\n\nThe team used neural networks and models of black hole physics to reconstruct\na 3D image that shows how explosive flare-ups in the disk of gas around our\nsupermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), might look.

Unlike in most computer graphics, where space and time are\n\"flat,\" the new method assumes that light moves on curved rays defined by the\nblack hole's mass and spin.\n\nImage Lightbox\n\n### Subscribe\n\nThe Caltech Weekly\n\n### Share this\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Share\n\n### Related Links\n\nCaltech Researchers Help Generate First Image of Black Hole at the Center of\nOur Galaxy > How to Take a Picture of a Black Hole >\n\nSee All News >\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\n1200 East California Boulevard\n\nPasadena, California 91125\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
