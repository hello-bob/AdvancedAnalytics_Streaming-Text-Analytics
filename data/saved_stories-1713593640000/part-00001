It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTech Conferences: Does Your Employer Pay?\n\nDoes your employer pay for you to attend tech conferences?\n\nYes, registration and travel are comped.\n\nYes, just registration but not travel expenses.\n\nYes, travel expenses but not registration.\n\nOnly virtual conferences.\n\nNo reimbursement.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nLinux creator Linus Torvalds sat down Wednesday for a \u201ckeynote interview\u201d at\nthe Linux Foundation\u2018s Open Source Summit North America in Seattle. Torvalds\nwas interviewed by Dirk Hohndel, an early Linux contributor (and currently the\nhead of Verizon\u2019s Open Source program office) \u2014 in what was billed as a\n\u201cfireside chat.\u201d\n\nBut what came through clearly was Torvalds\u2019 lifelong love of open source\ndevelopment \u2014 and how that\u2019s been playing out in the real world filled with\nupstream security issues, overhyped AI, and other people\u2019s hardware bugs.\n\nAlthough their conversation started with a humorous exchange...\n\nHohndel: We all know kernel development does include a lot of drama and a lot\nof high-stakes discussions... For example, a really important topic that once\nagain has reared its ugly head is tabs versus spaces.\n\nTorvalds: Oh, Christ...\n\n## Problems Beyond Your Control\n\nZoom\n\nLinus Torvalds\n\nHohndel said technology news sites covering Torvalds inserting tabs (to catch\nparsing tools that can\u2019t properly convert them to whitespace) are a kind of\ntriumph for the open source project \u2014 a \u201csign of the maturity and health of\nLinux, that a small comment could generate news articles.\u201d\n\nBut then Hohndel segued to the topic of \u201cproblems that are outside of your\ncontrol, that you end up dealing with anyway\u201d \u2014 and specifically, \u201cyet another\nround of hardware bugs.\u201d Torvalds agreed things like the newly discovered\nSpectre v2 exploit were frustrating \u2014 but not for the obvious reason.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. Simplify Linux and Docker Command Lines with Bash Completion\n  2. Project Bluefin: A Linux Desktop for Serious Developers\n  3. Linux: Run a Single Command across Multiple Servers with SSH\n  4. Linux: Migrate the Home Directory to Another Drive\n  5. Linux: Limit Concurrent Users on Your Server with SSH\n\n\u201cI got into doing kernels because I\u2019m interested in the hardware,\u201d Torvalds\npointed out. But he also loves Open Source development, and \u201cThe thing that is\nvery, very frustrating is that you have these technically interesting\nproblems, but then they are made to be a horrendous experience by all the\nsecrecy...\u201d\n\n> \u201cMy fear is that RISC-V will do all the same mistakes that everybody else\n> did before them.\u201d \u2014 Linus Torvalds\n\nZoom\n\nLinus Torvalds\n\nAnd Torvalds said it\u2019s frustrating for fast-reacting software developers to\nthen face the slower pace of hardware development. (\u201cOh, we have five\ngenerations of hardware that we can\u2019t fix after the fact, and it will take\nanother couple of years before the actual new hardware that can help you work\naround the problem comes out.\u201d) \u201cThat ends up being very frustrating \u2014 with\nthe whole added side of all the PR that goes along with any security issues.\u201d\n\nHohndel asked if things would get better with Open Source hardware \u2014\nespecially after five years of RISC-V development. But Torvalds isn\u2019t\nconvinced. \u201cMy fear is that RISC-V will do all the same mistakes that\neverybody else did before them... When RISC-V becomes more of a big, widely-\ndeployed platform, they\u2019ll have all the same issues we had on the ARM side,\nand that x86 had before them. And it will take a few generations for them to\nsay, \u2018Oh, we didn\u2019t think about that\u2019 \u2014 because they have new people\ninvolved.\u201d\n\nBut if hardware is developed out in the open, won\u2019t that make it easier for\nsoftware developers to warn them against repeating past mistakes?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fairly big gulf between the Verilog [the standard hardware\ndescription language] and even the kernel,\u201d Torvalds responded, \u201cmuch less\nhigher up the stack, where you\u2019re working so far away from the hardware, that\nyou really have no idea how the hardware works. So it\u2019s really hard to work\nacross this very wide gulf of things.\u201d\n\nHohndel then made an interesting observation. Ten years ago it was hard even\njust to move from x86 to a new platform, but \u201cToday most people don\u2019t even\nknow when they\u2019re running on a [AWS] Graviton... or an AMD or an Intel chip.\nIn the cloud, it all looks exactly the same, with the same software specs.\nJust the price point is different.\u201d\n\nAnd Torvalds says \u201cThat was one of the promises of open source. And people\nwere saying that this was true 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t true 10 years ago. But it\u2019s certainly reaching that point now.\u201d\n\n## Relying on Trust\n\nZoom\n\nTorvalds and Hohndel\n\nBut recently the open source community faced a stark reminder that security\nissues can come from the other direction too \u2014 from the community of\nmaintainers. When asked about the recent xz Util exploit, Torvalds shared his\nown perspective \u2014 starting by emphasizing that even proprietary software has\nits own reliance on trust. \u201c[Users] depend on the trust in the company. But\nalso within the company you depend on trust \u2014 in your employees. And that\ntrust can be violated.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how to figure out when it\u2019s being violated is an open problem.\u201d\n\nTorvalds spoke from decades of experience. Even a long-standing open source\nproject like Linux has \u201cseen this before,\u201d Torvalds said, remembering a 2021\nincident where University of Minnesota researchers tested how easy it would be\nto upstream bad kernel patches. (\u201cThat\u2019s actually an interesting study. They\njust didn\u2019t do it very well. They didn\u2019t tell a third party about this, and\nthey just sent us bad patches.\u201d) But now the open source ecosystem has seen an\nactual malicious attempt to upstream bad code \u2014 and in a world where, as\nTorvalds puts it, \u201cnobody really had any explicit gates in place to try to\ncatch this.\u201d\n\nYet Torvalds also sees a hopeful sign. Whether it\u2019s xz or those bad patches\nthat the students tried to upload for the kernel in 2021, \u201cIn both cases, they\nwere actually really caught fairly quickly.\u201d And that fact \u201cdoes seem to imply\na fairly strong amount of stability \u2014 and that these things do get caught.\u201d\n\nZoom\n\nLinus Torvalds\n\nEven with that, Torvalds acknowledges that \u201cClearly it\u2019s a wake-up call \u2014\nthere\u2019s no question about that... I think we\u2019re going to see a lot of work\nbeing put into some kind of trust model, where people see, \u2018Oh, this is a new\nperson\u2019, or \u2018This is a person that is acting differently from before.\u201d\n\nHohndel pointed out that deep within the Linux developer community, signature\nrequirements include a face-to-face meeting \u2014 and government-issued ID. And\nTorvalds agreed with Hohndel\u2019s idea that the best defense is a healthy\ncommunity.\n\nHohndel went on to note that \u201cThe Linux kernel has this incredibly big, but\nalso incredibly deeply entwined and connected community, where there are\nmultiyear, multidecade relationships at the core of all this.\u201d\n\nBut this prompted a reminder from Torvalds \u2014 that Linux\u2019s kernel is an\natypical open source project. \u201cA lot of open source projects, even very\ncentral ones, are basically run by one or two or three people... \u201d\n\n## AI for Open Source?\n\nZoom\n\nLinus Torvalds\n\nAt one point, Hohndel introduced the topic of AI, noting dire predictions it\nwill someday eliminate programmers, authors, movie creators, and jobs. \u201cSo you\nare going to be replaced by an AI model.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally!\u201d Torvalds joked.\n\nResponding more seriously, Torvalds added \u201cNo... I hate the hype... My\npersonal opinion is, let\u2019s wait 10 years and see where it actually goes before\nwe make all these crazy announcements of \u2018Your job will be gone in five\nyears.\u201d\n\nBut what about AI in coding tools? Torvalds admitted he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about\nAI, and \u201clooking forward to the tools to actually find bugs.\u201d With kernel\ndevelopers (and other projects) already religiously using the tooling they\nhave, \u201cmaking the tools smarter is not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nHe called smarter tools \u201cjust the next inevitable step... But I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s necessarily the gloom and doom that some people say it is, and I\ndefinitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s the promised world that people who are having\ntheir hand out for cash say it is.\u201d\n\nThere was a funny exchange when Torvalds warned his audience, \u201cYou need to be\na bit cynical about this whole hype cycle in the tech industry... Before AI it\nwas crypto, before crypto, it was whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cCloud native,\u201d suggested Hohndel. (Later adding that he\u2019d heard \u201cThat\u2019s not\nhype!\u201d from a \u201cloud voice in the front.\u201d)\n\nBut Torvalds reiterated his call to judge the news carefully. \u201cI mean, the\nhype? There\u2019s always like a grain of reality behind it. But you need to be\ncareful about all the BS around that grain.\u201d\n\n## The Point of Open Source\n\nZoom\n\nDirk Hohndel\n\nThroughout the half-hour interview, there were glimpses of what motivates\nTorvalds personally, after more than 30 years of Linux kernel development.\nWhen Hohndel said Open Data was almost the more interesting question, Torvalds\nreflexively responded \u201cNo It\u2019s not,\u201d before adding \u201cNot to me.\u201d But the Linux\nFoundation has Open Data projects, and \u201cto other people it\u2019s more interesting.\nAnd that is, I think, the whole \u2014 for me, the point of Open Source is that\ndifferent people are interested in different things... I was always interested\nin the low-level nitty-gritty of how the CPU actually works. Which is why I\u2019m\nworking on the kernel still.\u201d\n\nTowards the end, Torvalds said he didn\u2019t plan to start any new projects.\n\u201cLinux for me solved all the problems I had, way back in \u201992, maybe \u201993. And\nif it wasn\u2019t for the fact that others came around and said \u2018Hey, I need this,\u2019\nI would not have continued.\u201d\n\nThe things that keep is projects going are \u201cthe fact that \u2018Hey, this is\nactually useful to other people\u2019. Because if it\u2019s only something for me, it\u2019s\nnot really interesting in the long run.\u201d\n\nDavid Cassel is a proud resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, where he's\nbeen covering technology news for more than two decades.
