Stewart. The novel tells the story of the fall of civilization from\ndeadly disease and the emergence of a new culture with simpler tools. Set in\nthe 1940s in Berkeley, California, the story is told by Isherwood Williams,\nwho emerges from isolation in the mountains to find almost everyone dead.\n\nEarth Abides won the inaugural International Fantasy Award in 1951. It was\nincluded in Locus Magazine's list of best All Time Science Fiction in 1987 and\n1998^[2] and was a nominee to be entered into the Prometheus Hall of Fame some\ntime before 2002.^[3]\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n### \"Part I: World Without End\"[edit]\n\nWhile working on his graduate thesis in geography in the Sierra Nevada, Ish is\nbitten by a rattlesnake. As he heals from the bite in a cabin, he gets sick\nwith a disease similar to measles, and he lapses in and out of consciousness.\nHe eventually recovers and makes his way back to civilization, only to\ndiscover that it has collapsed after most people have died from the same\ndisease. He decides to go to his home in Berkeley, California. In the city\nnear his home Ish meets a few survivors and also encounters a friendly and\neager dog, which he names Princess, who swiftly adopts Ish as her new master.\nHe sets out on a cross-country tour, traveling all the way to New York City\nand back, scavenging for food and fuel as he goes. As he travels, he finds\nsmall groups of survivors, but has doubts about humanity's ability to survive\nthe loss of civilization.\n\nIsh returns to his home in California. After reading Ecclesiastes, he realizes\nthat he had been throwing his life away and then finds a woman, Emma, living\nnearby. They agree to consider themselves married and have children. They are\ngradually joined by other survivors. Over time the electricity (which had been\nprovided by automated hydro power station) fails and the comforts of\ncivilization recede. As the children grow, Ish tries to instill basic\nacademics by teaching reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography, but he is\nlargely unsuccessful due to a lack of interest by the others.\n\nMany children are born in these years, including Joey, Ish's youngest and\nfavorite son. Joey is very similar in nature to Ish, as he demonstrates innate\nintelligence and a curiosity about the world before the epidemic. This leads\nIsh to believe that Joey is the key to the future.\n\n### \"Part II: The Year 22\"[edit]\n\nTwenty-two years later, the community flourishes, with the young adapting\neasily to the de-modernised world. They come to have a better grasp of the\nnatural world than the adults, and when running water fails, the younger\ngeneration comes to the rescue, knowing where flowing streams may be found.\nIsh turns his attention from ecology to his newly forming society, and he\nnotices that the children are becoming very superstitious. One day Ish asks\nfor his hammer which he habitually carries around, and finds the children are\nafraid to touch it as it is a symbol to them of the old times; the long-dead\n\"Americans\" of the old world are now viewed like gods, including Ish.\n\nThe older boys return from a cross country trip with a stranger named Charlie,\nwho exposes the tribe to typhoid fever which kills many, including Joey.\nThrough his despair, Ish is forced to face the future with a different set of\nexpectations and hopes. His ambition to restore civilization to its original\nstate is replaced by a more modest, practical one to simply convey a few basic\nsurvival skills; such as making bows and arrows, which the children think are\ngreat playthings.\n\nAs the years go by, the community begins to grow corn. Ish presides at\nmeetings, his hammer being a symbol of his status. Though he is respected,\nmany of his ideas are ignored by the younger men.\n\n### \"Part III: The Last American\"[edit]\n\nIsh spends most of his elderly life in a mental \"fog\", unaware of the world.\nOccasionally the fog in his mind lifts. During one such time, he finds himself\naware of his great-grandson Jack, who stands before him. Jack tells him that\nthe bow and arrow have become more reliable than the gun, whose cartridges do\nnot always work. Jack also mentions that the differently colored arrowheads\nthat he has made, unbeknownst to him, from several coin denominations are\nsuitable for hunting different game. Ish finds this belief superstitious, but\ndecides it would be futile to challenge it. Ish realizes that the former\ncivilization is now completely gone and will not be rebuilt anytime soon. He\nbecomes reconciled to the way things have changed. When Ish is dying, the\nyounger men insist that his hammer be passed on. Ish chooses Jack.\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\nIsherwood Williams (Ish) is a graduate student at Berkeley, studying the\ngeography of an area in the mountains, somewhere in California. He is\nsometimes referred to in the book as \"The Last American.\" Ish becomes the\nleader of the community, aka \"the tribe\", he believes due to his intellect.\nHis nickname, Ish, is an obvious reference to Ishi, the \"last Wild Indian.\"\nIsh is also the word for \"man\" in Hebrew.\n\nEmma (Em) is a woman who Isherwood meets in his hometown. The author may have\nbeen taking a chance with this character, who is, at least partially, African-\nAmerican,^[4] while Isherwood is white; when the book was written, interracial\nmarriages were heavily discouraged in American society.^[5] Isherwood does\nmarry her, and race isn't important to the couple's relationship. Em (\"mother\"\nin Hebrew) becomes the community's mother, letting it grow as it will, but\nstepping in to help when no one else is filling the leadership role. She is\nthe adult while others panic, and Ish thinks of her as the \"Mother of\nNations\".^[6] In her old age, she disagrees with Ish about a request by a\nsmaller community, known as the Others, to join the Tribe. Ish initially\nopposes the idea, but Em supports it, and Ish changes his mind.\n\nEzra meets Emma and Ish while traveling through Berkeley, he was a former\nliquor salesman and immigrant from Yorkshire, England. They liked him, but\nfeared the complications of a love triangle, so they encouraged him to leave.\nHe returned with Molly and Jean, his wives.^[7] Ish values Ezra as a good\njudge of people, saying \"Ezra knew people, Ezra liked people.\"\n\nGeorge is a carpenter by trade. George is not intellectually intelligent but\nbecomes a Jack-of-all-trades able to build, repair or maintain the limited\ninfrastructure of the small community.\n\nEvie is a \"half grown girl\" who Ezra found living \"in squalor and solitude.\"\nShe appears to have a mental illness, and the others all care and provide for\nher.^[8] Evie grows into an attractive young woman but the tribe has a rule,\nthat as the children grow no one will marry her\u2014she wouldn't understand, and\nher mental condition could possibly be hereditary.\n\nJoey is the youngest son of Ish and Em. Of all the children in the Tribe, he\nis the only one that truly understands the academic skills that Ish tries to\nteach \u2014 geometry, reading, geography. He dies during the typhoid fever\noutbreak.\n\nCharlie is a stranger who arrives from Los Angeles after two of the \"boys\"\n(the second generation) make a scouting expedition in a refurbished Jeep to\nsee what is left of America. Immediately upon his arrival Ish and Ezra become\nsuspicious about Charlie and the type of person he might be. Their suspicions\nare confirmed a day later when Charlie sets his eye on Evie. He also reveals\nto Ezra after drinking heavily that he has had many of \"Cupid's\" diseases. Ish\nconfronts Charlie about Evie, Charlie is disrespectful and challenges Ish's\nauthority as leader. It is revealed that Charlie carries a concealed pistol\nand his behavior reveals himself as someone who was probably a violent\ncriminal before the epidemic. As a result, Ish, Em, Ezra and George debate\nwhat to do about Charlie for the safety of the community, exile or execution.\nCharlie is the carrier of the typhoid epidemic that infects the community.\n\nJack is Ish's great-grandson. He's a young man who hunts with arrows he makes\nhimself. Jack is confident, intelligent and a potential leader, and Ish sees\nsomething of Joey in him; although he has beliefs which to Ish seem\nsuperstitious and naive. Like others of his generation, Jack believes Ish's\nold hammer is something very important for the Tribe. He risks his life by\ngoing into a burning house to retrieve the hammer. A little later, as Ish is\ndying, the young men want to know who the hammer will now belong to, and Ish\nchooses Jack.\n\n## Major themes[edit]\n\n### Biological controls on population[edit]\n\nOn the title page Stewart immediately starts with the theme, quoting\nEcclesiastes 1:4 \u2014 \"Men go and come, but earth abides.\" For the first half of\nEarth Abides, George R. Stewart concentrates on a major theme for the book,\nthat humans have no privileged place in nature and are not immune to nature's\nbuilt-in population controls. The main character, a geographer, states it\nplainly, \"When anything gets too numerous it's likely to get hit by some\nplague\".^[9]\n\nOn the first page Stewart tells readers how contagion could bring the end very\nquickly for mankind:\n\n> \"If a killing type of virus strain should suddenly arise by mutation... it\n> could, because of the rapid transportation in which we indulge nowadays, be\n> carried to the far corners of the earth and cause the deaths of millions of\n> people.\" W. M. Stanley, in Chemical and Engineering News, December 22,\n> 1947.^[10]\n\nWithin a few pages he makes it clear that basic biology applies to humans too:\n\n> \"Some zoologists have even suggested a biological law: that the number of\n> individuals in a species never remains constant, but always rises and\n> falls\u2014the higher the animal and the slower its breeding-rate, the longer its\n> period of fluctuation [...] As for man, there is little reason to think that\n> he can in the long run escape the fate of other creatures, and if there is a\n> biological law of flux and reflux, his situation is now a highly perilous\n> one....Biologically, man has for too long a time been rolling an\n> uninterrupted run of sevens.\"^[11]\n\n### Effects of smaller population[edit]\n\nReviewer Noel Perrin has pointed out that George R. Stewart had written two\nbooks before this, in which the main character was not a person, but \"a\nnatural force.\" In Storm the main character is weather, and in Fire, a forest\nfire takes center stage.^[12]\n\nIn the same way, Stewart centers the first half of Earth Abides on the forces\nof natural and artificial selection. In freeing the landscape from humans,\nhalf of the book is devoted to looking at how the world would change in their\nabsence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and\nsends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without\npeople. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care of them or\ncontrolling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one\nanother. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that\nthey are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt\nand survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of\nalmost every plant and animal around them.\n\nAnother theme of the book is what happens to human skills as the population\ndecreases. Reviewer Lionel Shriver points out this theme in an article about\nliterature which features human extinction:\n\n> But as Stewart tracks three post-plague generations, he vividly demonstrates\n> that advanced civilisation depends on numbers. Reduce the race to the size\n> of a small town and how many residents will remember how to make plastic?\n> The last Americans plunder canned goods (with little respect for sell-by\n> dates), and literacy atrophies; electrical and water systems break down. At\n> length, the community reverts to its hunter-gatherer forebears.^[13]\n\nStewart uses the second half of his book to show that, if humans are reduced\nto low numbers, it will be difficult for them to continue civilization as we\nknow it. Reading becomes a casualty.\n\n> The society is so small that the death of one member\u2014a little boy named\n> Joey\u2014seems likely to determine for many generations to come whether the\n> emerging society will or won't be literate...As Ish thinks of it, each new\n> baby is a candle lit against the dark.^[12]\n\nIf skills and customs don't work in the new situation, these die out, or those\nholding them do. Children adapt naturally to the new situation, and\nimmediately useful customs and skills are more interesting to them than\nreading and writing. The information in libraries is useless within a\ngeneration.\n\nOne custom that Stewart predicts could die out is racism. When there are fewer\npartners to choose from, mankind will not be able to afford to be too choosy\nin picking one's partner.\n\nAnother issue he brings up is how law and order will function, when the\nlawmakers, courts and enforcers are all gone. Even laws won't be immune to the\npressure to survive. One of the characters in the book point out, \"What laws?\"\nwhen they have to determine the fate of an outsider. Stewart shows how people\nmay come to worry about potential harm rather than justice when dealing with\noutsiders.\n\n### Biblical theme: replenishing the Earth[edit]\n\nHaving explored the depopulated Earth, Stewart shifts his thematic focus in\npart 2 and 3, from the biological theme of population crash to a biblical\ntheme of populating the world.\n\nA 1949 book review says that Earth Abides parallels two biblical stories that\nshows mankind spreading out and populating the world:\n\n> ...the dual themes are as old as Genesis...Not a flood but a swift and\n> deadly new disease wipes out all but a few of the human race. Ish (for\n> \"Isherwood\") is the Noah of this \"Great Disaster.\" As material civilization\n> begins to crumble, Ish gradually devolves into a kind of Adam who,\n> inevitably, finds his Eve, Em (For \"Emma\"), a level-headed lady with Negro\n> blood, and nature takes its time-worn course. Em is hailed by Ish as \"The\n> Mother of Nations.\"^[14]\n\nStewart, who specialized in meanings of names, chose names in Hebrew that have\nappropriate meanings for the biblical theme; this couple who restart the human\ntribe are symbolically man and mother. In Stewart's day, most Hebrew\ndictionaries stated that Ish means \"man\" (although a more accurate English\nequivalent is \"participant\"),^[15] and Em means \"mother\".^[16] Both terms\nfigure prominently in the biblical story of Adam and Eve: Ish in Genesis 2:23,\nand Em in Genesis 3:20.\n\nIn addition to the Hebraic names in Earth Abides, the story also has a symbol\nin common with biblical tradition\u2014the snake. Ish encounters a rattlesnake;\nbefore this event he is part of a larger civilization. After it bites him, his\nworld changes, just as the snake changes Adam's world in the Genesis story.\nAdam loses paradise, and Ish finds civilization dead.\n\nAside from the biblical origin of Ish, there is another tale of the fall of\ncivilization that George R. Stewart could have taken account of, the story of\nIshi, believed, at the time Stewart was writing, to be the last of his tribe,\nwho lived at Berkeley, where Stewart later taught. Ish is very similar to\nIshi, and it also means \"man\", in the language of a man whose whole tribe was\ndead. Ishi's story parallels the Genesis and Earth Abides stories, telling of\none who has to adapt to a changed world.^[17]\n\n## Genre and style[edit]\n\nEarth Abides belongs to the subgenre of apocalyptic science fiction featuring\na universal plague that nearly wipes out humanity. Other examples include Mary\nShelley's The Last Man (1826), Jack London's The Scarlet Plague (1912),\nMichael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain (1969) and Stephen King's The Stand\n(1978).^[18]\n\nEarth Abides also fits into the \"post-apocalyptic\" subgenre. It was published\nin 1949, four years after the end of World War II and in the earliest stages\nof the Cold War. While post-apocalyptic fiction is now quite common, Earth\nAbides distinctly predates many similar well-known novels including Alas,\nBabylon (1959), A Canticle for Leibowitz (1960), and The Last Ship^[19]\n(1988). It is predated, however by The Machine Stops (1909), and Ren\u00e9\nBarjavel's Ashes, Ashes (Ravage, 1943), among others.\n\nA common theme of post-apocalyptic works is, \"What if the world we know no\nlonger exists,\" and each of these books paints a different picture of the\nfuture. Earth Abides explores such issues as family structure, education, the\nmeaning and purpose of civilization, and the basic nature of humankind \u2014\nespecially in regard to religion, superstition, and custom. As it was written\nin the beginning years of the Cold War, it lacks some common post-apocalyptic\nconventions found in later novels: There are no warlords or biker gangs (as in\nMad Max), no fear of atomic weapons or radiation, and no mutants or warring\ntribes^[20] (as in A Canticle for Leibowitz). When the main character in Earth\nAbides travels through the country, he notices little sign of there having\nbeen violence or civil unrest during the plague period. Many areas seem to\nhave been evacuated, and only in or near hospitals are there large numbers of\ncorpses.\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\nAccording to WorldCat.org, there have been 28 editions of Earth Abides\npublished in English. The book has been in print in every decade from 1949 to\n2008.\n\nJames Sallis, writing in 2003 in the Boston Globe:\n\n> This is a book, mind you, that I'd place not only among the greatest science\n> fiction but among our very best novels. Each time I read it, I'm profoundly\n> affected, affected in a way only the greatest art \u2014 Ulysses, Matisse or\n> Beethoven symphonies, say \u2014 affects me. Epic in sweep, centering on the\n> person of Isherwood Williams, Earth Abides proves a kind of antihistory,\n> relating the story of humankind backwards, from ever-more-abstract\n> civilization to stone-age primitivism.^[21]\n\nAstounding reviewer P. Schuyler Miller identified the novel as one of the\nfirst regarding \"a young and little understood science, the science of\necology.\" Miller praised Stewart for \"the intricacy of detail with which he\nhas worked out his problem in ecology\" and for writing \"quietly, with very few\npeaks of melodrama as seem necessary in much popular fiction.\"^[22]\n\nIt was mentioned in a serious overview of modern science fiction, Contemporary\nScience Fiction by August Derleth, in the January 1952 edition of College\nEnglish. Derleth called it an \"excellent example\" of the \"utopian theme\" of\n\"rebuilding after a holocaust leaving but few survivors.\"\n\nIt was described as a persuasive answer to the question, \"What is man,\" in the\nOctober, 1973 edition of Current Anthropology. The article \"Anthropology and\nScience Fiction\" ^[23] examines the nature of Science Fiction and its\nrelationship to understanding people. The magazine concluded of Earth Abides\nthat it shows ...\"man is man, be he civilized or tribal. Stewart shows us that\na tribal hunting culture is just as valid and real to its members as\ncivilization is to us.\"\n\nIn the American Quarter article California's Literary Regionalism, Autumn\n1955, George R. Stewart is seen as a \"humanist in the old classical sense. His\nnovels, Storm, Fire, East of the Giants, Earth Abides, demonstrate the complex\ninterlocking of topography, climate, and human society; and their general tone\nis objective and optimistic.\"\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\nIn November 1950, the book was adapted for the CBS radio program Escape as a\ntwo-part drama starring John Dehner.^[24] In early 2024 it was announced that\na television adaptation was underway at Amazon MGM Studios.^[25]\n\n## References to other works[edit]\n\nThe book makes a reference to Robinson Crusoe and The Swiss Family Robinson.\nIsh compares the situations within these books to what he is going through. He\nfinds Robinson Crusoe less appealing, because \"his religious preoccupations\nseemed boring and rather silly\".^[26] He looks at the ship in The Swiss Family\nRobinson as an \"infinite grab-bag from which at any time they might take\nexactly what they wanted,\"^[27] which is similar to the situation of those\nliving after the Great Disaster.\n\nStewart also mentions Ecclesiastes 1:4 in the title and theme: \"Men go and\ncome, but Earth abides\".^[28]\n\n## Legacy and homages[edit]\n\n  * Stephen King has stated that Earth Abides was an inspiration for his post-apocalyptic novel, The Stand.^[29]\n  * Composer Philip Aaberg wrote a piece of music, titled \"Earth Abides\", inspired by the novel. The piece was originally written as part of a sound track commissioned by the National Geographic Society for a documentary on the Earth. The track can be found on the Windham Hill CD \"A Winter's Solstice III\" (track 15).^[30]\n  * Jimi Hendrix claimed that Earth Abides was his favorite book and his song \"Third Stone from the Sun\" is inspired by the novel.^[31]\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Graham Sleight. \"Yesterday's Tomorrows: Arthur C.
