WCK, a key agency in humanitarian\nrelief efforts in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the war, halted\noperations following the incident. Several other organizations also announced\nthey would be suspending operations in the Gaza Strip due to fear for their\nworkers\u2019 lives. The killing of the aid workers, six of whom were foreign\nnationals, drew sharp criticism of Israel from senior officials in the\ninternational community, chiefly, US President Joe Biden. In a special\nstatement released by the White House, President Biden asserted that Israel\nwas not doing enough to avoid harming civilians and aid workers trying to\ndeliver \u201cdesperately needed\u201d help to the hungry population in Gaza Strip, and\nthat this was not a \u201cstand-alone incident.\u201d All of this comes in the wake of\nthe provisional measures issued by the International Court of Justice at the\nend of January, instructing Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nResponding to international pressure, Israeli officials, including the IDF\nSpokesperson and the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories\n(COGAT) pledged to work towards improving humanitarian conditions in the Gaza\nStrip, released figures on this subject and even announced Erez Crossing would\nreopen and the numbers of trucks permitted to enter Gaza increase. The IDF\nSpokesperson went so far as announcing \u201cexpansion of efforts to facilitate\nhumanitarian aid into Gaza\u201d to the foreign press.\n\nIt is too soon to determine how the shift in Israel\u2019s policy will affect\nreality on the ground. Yet it is clearly too little, too late, and attests to\nIsrael being chiefly responsible for the humanitarian crisis that has, since\nthe war began about six months ago, spiraled into the catastrophe we are\nwitnessing now. For months, Israel refused to let humanitarian aid in through\nthe land crossings in its territory, thereby limiting the amount of aid that\ncould enter. Even when, following international pressure, Israel did agree to\nallow aid in through its territory, the amounts were a far cry from the needs\nof the population, and Israel even stooped so low as to try and present a\nfalse image that there was no serious nutritional crisis in Gaza. The current\nchange in policy cannot absolve Israel of its responsibility for the hunger\ncrisis in the Gaza Strip, and it is doubtful whether the \u201cnew measures\u201d it\nrecently announced \u2013 whose effect on the ground, to the extent they actually\nexist, it is to early to analyze \u2013 can meet the current needs of the civilian\npopulation there.\n\nIn this document, we review the current scale of the hunger crisis in the Gaza\nStrip, its short and long term impacts, Israel\u2019s conduct with respect to this\nissue and the legal implications of this conduct. We rely on the most recent\nfigures and data available.\n\nBased on various reports from international bodies about the situation in Gaza\nand on testimonies gathered by B'Tselem's field researchers, we unfortunately\nconclude that for months, Israel has been committing the crime of starvation\nunder international law in the Gaza Strip.\n\n### The state of hunger in the Gaza Strip in recent months\n\nThe IPC report, an initiative involving more than 15 international\nhumanitarian aid organizations led by the UN and published in late March,\ndetermined the Gaza Strip was on the verge of famine. This constitutes Phase 5\nof the IPC, or Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, with half of\nGaza\u2019s residents suffering from catastrophic food insecurity. According to the\naccepted international standard, an area is in a state of famine when at least\n20% of households face extreme food gaps, and at least 30% of children suffer\nfrom severe malnutrition.\n\nAccording to the report, in February and March 2024, the entire Gaza Strip was\nin Phase 4 of the hunger scale, with some households already at Phase 5 of\nacute food insecurity: 55% of households in the north, 25% in central Gaza,\nand 25% in the south. The report predicted that the situation would further\ndeteriorate in the coming months, with a projected 70% of households in the\nnorth, 50% in central Gaza and 45% in the south reaching Phase 5.\n\nSimilar figures and cautions have been released in recent weeks by the World\nHealth Organization, USAID, Human Rights Watch, World Food Programme, The\nGlobal Nutrition Cluster, and other international humanitarian officials.\nAccording to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n(OCHA), in March 2024, 2.2 million people (nearly 100% of the population) in\nGaza were experiencing Phase 3 level food insecurity or worse, 1.17 million\nwere at Phase 4 and nearly half a million people were experiencing the highest\nlevel of food insecurity \u2013 Phase 5.\n\n> \"There is no food or water here.

Read the full testimony here\n\nIn early April, Samantha Power, who heads the United States Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID), assessed that famine was already occurring\nin northern Gaza. The assessment was given during a hearing of the US House\nForeign Affairs Committee. This was the first time a US official declared\nfamine was already present in Gaza, after months of warnings that the hunger\ncrisis was escalating.\n\nMany officials report the impact on the ground. International medical teams\nthat visited Kamal Adwan Hospital, the only medical facility in northern Gaza\nthat centers on pediatrics, reported a full-blown humanitarian catastrophe.\nThe Director-General of the World Health Organization said that 10 children\nhave died in hospital as a result of hunger. OCHA reported that 32 people, 28\nof them children, have died of malnutrition or dehydration since the start of\nthe war in the Gaza Strip. It has also been reported that about 16% of\nchildren under the age of two in northern Gaza are suffering severe\nmalnutrition, and 5% in Rafah. The World Health Organization has also said\nthat all households in Gaza are \u201cskipping\u201d meals as a result of the dire food\nshortage, with adults holding back so their children can eat. The humanitarian\nsituation report put out by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) notes\nthat in the week between February 29 and March 6, the UNICEF hotline received\nmore than 1,000 calls about food shortages or hunger, mainly in northern Gaza.\n\n> \"Yazan was born with muscle disease, and was treated in hospitals in Gaza\n> and Jerusalem.

Read the full testimony here\n\nAn emergency medical team of volunteers from several aid organizations around\nthe world has reported patients dying of infections due to acute malnutrition.\nAid workers arriving at hospitals in the Gaza Strip encounter exhausted and\nhungry medical teams in desperate need of food and water. Hospital patients \u2013\npeople with chronic conditions such as cancer or diabetes, people recovering\nfrom serious injuries, surgeries and loss of limbs due to the fighting, as\nwell as women who have recently given birth and newborns \u2013 are all suffering\nhunger that impedes their recovery.\n\nThe chair of the Israel\u2019s National Food Security Council, Prof. Roni Strier,\nrecently addressed the state of food security in Gaza, saying:\n\n\"There are solid testimonies by international organizations that we have\nongoing working relationships with such as the World Bank, the World Health\nOrganization, the World Food Programme \u2013 and various institutions like\ninternational aid organizations and the global press \u2013 attesting to the\nexceptional humanitarian disaster, which includes extreme hunger of the local\npopulation.\"\n\n### The impact of hunger on the health of the population\n\nMalnutrition can increase susceptibility to diseases and infections,\nespecially among children, as well as the chance that these will result in\ndeath.[1] It significantly extends recovery time from existing illnesses and\ninjuries, and increases the chance of long-term health effects. There is\nalready a high mortality rate among children in Gaza due to a combination of\nmalnutrition and existing diseases.\n\n> \"There are nine of us in the tent without water, electricity and\n> medications, and with almost no food.

Read the full testimony here\n\nIn addition to the devastating short-term effects, hunger has fateful long-\nterm implications. Malnutrition and its side effects have far-reaching\nconsequences for children\u2019s neurological and cognitive development, especially\nin the first two years of life. Babies who are born underweight and children\nwho suffer from malnutrition have a lower IQ, and their academic performance\nand achievements are lower. Hunger is also a significant contributing factor\nin increased behavioral and psychological problems among children.\n\nMoreover, malnutrition in the first years of life interferes with the\ndevelopment of the musculoskeletal system, as well as the development of\nintestinal bacteria, a lack of which increases the risk of chronic disease in\nold age. Malnutrition during pregnancy impedes cognitive development and\nincreases the risk of diabetes and obesity later in life. Hunger and\nmalnutrition may even contribute to the development of health disorders in\nfuture generations, including, among others, cardiovascular diseases,\ndiabetes, obesity and an increased tendency to transmit infectious diseases\nand infections, such as tuberculosis.[2]\n\n### Difficulty transporting and distributing humanitarian aid\n\nAfter six months of fighting and incessant bombardment (following on years of\nblockade and frequent military operations), there is little to no possibility\nto grow food or produce food based on locally grown products. A large\nproportion of Gaza\u2019s agricultural areas have been destroyed in bombings, and\nthose remaining are still a risk to Palestinian farmers as they are exposed to\nshelling. All branches of the food production sector have been heavily\ndamaged, and the mass destruction caused by the Israeli bombings have almost\ncompletely disabled food production factories, bakeries, food warehouses and\nmarkets. In addition, the hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their\nhomes have little or no access to running water and to supplies and provisions\nrequired for cooking.\n\nTestimonies given to B'Tselem indicate that the price of food and other items\nstill available in the Gaza Strip has gone up by hundreds of percent or more,\ncreating exorbitant costs that the vast majority of the population cannot\nafford. In this shocking state of affairs, repeated posts by the Israeli\nCoordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) showing\nphotos of stands overflowing with food in Gaza are revolting. Given the prices\nat these stands, as described in testimonies, this is clearly an attempt by\nthe Israeli military to create the impression that there is enough food in\nGaza, while the reality is entirely different.\n\n> \"A bag of flour that cost 30 shekels (~USD 8) before the war has gone up to\n> 600 shekels (~USD 168). We had to make do with one meal a day and there were\n> days when we didn\u2019t eat at all. Sometimes, the neighbors gave us some water\n> and food. It was also very dangerous to go out to stock up on food because\n> of the gunfire and bombings. [...] Once every 10-15 days, water is supplied,\n> and sometimes, it\u2019s possible to get flour and make pita bread, but most of\n> the time, we really have nothing to eat.

A\n> little while ago, we managed to buy a kilo of dates for NIS 40 (~ USD X),\n> which has been helping us survive. We live off what we manage to get - a\n> little rice, a little corn we ground, and also barley, which is meant for\n> feeding farm animals. The price of barley has also gone crazy. Now even the\n> barley ran out and people have started grinding bird and rabbit food. But\n> there is not much of that either. There is no food for humans or for\n> animals\".\n>\n> Ibrahim a-Ghandur, 38, Gaza City. Read the full testimony here\n\nTo obtain food, residents of the Gaza Strip now rely almost entirely on aid\nfrom states and international organizations. However, the aid trucks go\nthrough a lengthy, arduous process until they reach their destination inside\nGaza, Most of the aid supplies are stored in al-Arish, Egypt. From there, they\nare transported to Gaza in trucks via one of only two crossings, both located\nin the southern Gaza Strip. Access to these crossings is difficult and time-\nconsuming, with many stops along the way. The trucks\u2019 cargo is checked\nmultiple times, usually both at Rafah Crossing and at Nitzana or at Kerem\nShalom, causing major delays. The cargo is unloaded at the crossings, and then\nloaded onto other trucks and taken to storage facilities inside the Strip.\nFrom there, the aid is distributed in different parts of Gaza, in coordination\nwith Israel. Due to the restrictions Israel imposes and to the severe damage\nto infrastructure caused by the Israeli bombings, only a fraction of the aid\nreaches the northern Gaza Strip, where, as the figures show, the humanitarian\nsituation in general, and hunger in particular, are particularly severe.\n\nBecause of the many obstacles to humanitarian relief efforts on the ground,\ninitiatives and plans to bring aid through the air and the sea have gained\nmomentum. In addition to the marine aid corridor established off the shores of\nGaza, by early April, nine countries (Jordan, Egypt, the USA, the UAE,\nGermany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Singapore) received permission\nto airdrop aid from cargo planes flying over the Gaza Strip. These workarounds\nhelp get around Israel\u2019s cumbersome bureaucracy, but experts say they are\nslow, expensive, and very limited in quantity compared to the aid brought in\nby truck. Airdropped aid has also proven to cause damage and injury, killing\nfive people since early March, according to Palestinian media.\n\nAs if the myriad obstacles Israel is putting in the way of the humanitarian\nresponse to the crisis it created are not enough, Israel is also making it\ndifficult to effectively distribute the aid to the population, which is\nstruggling to survive. For example, despite the critical role played by the UN\nRelief and Works Agency (UNRWA), collecting and distributing the aid, since\nthe beginning of the hostilities Israel has taken steps to restrict the\nUNRWA\u2019s operations and even oust it from the Gaza Strip, over claims some of\nits employees took part in the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. These steps\nare taken despite the fact that no other body can assume the many civilian and\nhumanitarian roles the agency plays.\n\nUNRWA and a host of leading humanitarian aid organizations claim that for many\nmonths now, Israel has not met its legal and moral obligations, and in\npractice provides only limited and reduced nutritional aid that is nowhere\nnear meeting the current scope of hunger. Figures on growing hunger in the\nGaza Strip corroborate these claims. In March, EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep\nBorrell said Israel was causing hunger and using starvation as a method of\nwarfare. Israel is also denying visas to aid workers seeking access to Gaza\nand even boasts of denying the applications.\n\nThe State of Israel, for its part, shirks its responsibility for the\nsituation, claiming among other things, that Hamas is to blame for disrupting\naid convoys and for stealing the aid. Whether these claims are substantiated\nor not, Israel remains responsible for taking every necessary measure to meet\nthe occupied population\u2019s humanitarian needs.\n\n> \"Our situation is very difficult. We now rely entirely on charity, but there\n> isn\u2019t enough food. The only things you can buy here are canned food and\n> grains that cost a lot. There\u2019s nothing healthy to eat.

Read the full testimony here\n\nThe aid shipments that manage to overcome the many obstacles, including those\nimposed by Israel, sometimes come up against Israel\u2019s war machine, which\ncontinues to operate in Gaza. In mid-March, the Palestinian Ministry of Health\nreportedly said at least 21 people were killed and 150 wounded by IDF fire\nwhen they crowded Kuwait Square in Gaza City to receive aid. A similar\nincident occurred earlier, in late February, when more than 100 people were\nkilled and more than 700 were injured as thousands stormed aid trucks arriving\nat a-Rashid Street in Gaza City. Israel claimed most of the deaths were caused\nby the trucks themselves and the crowding, and that the troops followed open-\nfire regulations. The Palestinian Ministry of Health, however, said the\ngunfire was to blame for many of the injuries. Testimonies received by\nB'Tselem indicated the same.\n\n> \"But what happened at a-Nabulsi Square on 29 February 2024 is something I\n> will never forget. I went there along with thousands of others to get sacks\n> of flour, and when we got near the trucks, we came under massive fire.

Read the full testimony here\n\n### The war crime of starvation\n\nInternational human rights law contains a general prohibition on starvation.\nThis includes prohibiting states from taking measures that would result in\ndenying people access to food, even when they live outside the state\u2019s\nterritory.[3]\n\nThe prohibition on starvation as a method of warfare follows from the general\nobligation laid out in the laws of war to protecting the civilian population\nduring wartime, and from the consequent prohibition on harming objects\nnecessary for the population\u2019s survival.[4]\n\nA concrete, criminal prohibition on starvation is set out in the Rome Statute\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC). Starvation of civilians as a method\nof warfare is defined in the Statute as a war crime, which falls under the\nICC\u2019s jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute.\n\nThe Rome Statute definition of the crime of starvation is:\n\n\"Intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by\ndepriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, including willfully\nimpeding relief supplies...\"\n\n(Rome Statute of the ICC, art. 8(2)(b)(xxv))\n\nThe crime contains four elements \u2013 conduct, intent, context and awareness of\nthe context. If all four are present, the crime has been committed. Below we\nbriefly examine the four elements in relation to what we know about Israel\u2019s\nactions in the Gaza Strip in recent months.\n\n  1. The prohibited conduct is depriving the population of objects indispensable to its survival (or deliberately supplying insufficient quantities). Objects required for survival can be diverse and may include different elements, depending on the specific circumstances. Actions that indirectly impact access to the objects necessary for survival may also be considered starvation, when the outcome contributes to denying access.\n\nAs noted, for many months, Israel has prevented the required scope of\nhumanitarian relief, including food and medicines, from entering the Gaza\nStrip and particularly northern Gaza. The destruction that Israel sowed during\nthe fighting has all but obliterated the ability to locally grow food or\nsource it for production. Given these circumstances, the population\u2019s diet\nrelies almost entirely on outside aid, which is controlled by Israel. As\ndescribed above, Israel is failing to meet its obligations in this regard by\nnot allowing sufficient aid to enter the Gaza Strip and by failing to\nguarantee the safe arrival of the aid to its destination, even in areas it\nsays are under its control.\n\n  1. The second element is intentional use of starvation as a method of warfare, i.e., to gain a military advantage or enfeeble the enemy. The prohibition applies to conduct that is known to cause starvation and is meant to serve the war effort. Consequently, there is no requirement for an outcome (such as civilian deaths or a mass malnutrition) to result directly from the conduct that falls under the definition of starvation.\n\nIsrael\u2019s intent to use starvation in order to gain a military advantage is\nreflected in statements made by senior politicians and military commanders,\nthat denying residents food and water is part of Israel\u2019s methods of warfare\nin the Gaza Strip. For example, Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, a member of\nthe war cabinet, which is the highest forum directing Israel\u2019s policy in its\nwar in Gaza, explicitly stated that denying food and water is part of the\nfighting: \u201cWe are imposing a full siege on Gaza City. There is no electricity,\nno food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting beasts and\nwe are acting accordingly.\" Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir tied\nefforts to release the Israeli hostages to preventing humanitarian aid from\nentering Gaza: \u201cAs long as Hamas refuses to release the hostages it is\nholding, the only thing that should enter Gaza is hundreds of tons of Air\nForce explosives, and not a gram of humanitarian relief.\u201d Foreign Minister\nYisrael Katz said: \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve given Gaza electricity, water and fuel.\nInstead of thanking us, they sent thousands of beasts to butcher, rape and\nkidnap babies, women and elderly people. That is why we decided to stop the\nsupply of water, electricity and fuel, and now their local power plant has\ncollapsed and there\u2019s no electricity in Gaza. We will continue to tighten the\nsiege until the threat that Hamas poses to Israel and to the world is removed.\nThe past will not be the future.\u201d\n\nAs for Israel\u2019s awareness that its actions are causing starvation \u2013 there is\nno doubt that Israeli officials are aware of the developing hunger in the Gaza\nStrip and particularly in the north, which Prime Minister Netanyahu says has\nbeen \u201cconquered\u201d by Israel. This awareness is the result of the large number\nof reports and figures published by international bodies, alongside an appeal\nto the Israeli Supreme Court filed by several Israeli human rights\norganizations headed by Gisha. In addition, Israel has been imposing a\nblockade on Gaza for years, and as part of this policy has addressed Gaza\u2019s\n\u2018economy needs\u2019 \u2013 calculating the minimal requirements for the subsistence of\nthe population.\n\n  1. The context for the commission of the crime has to be an international armed conflict. There is no dispute that the fighting in the Gaza Strip is an international armed conflict.\n  2. The perpetrator must be aware of the context and the circumstances that constitute such a conflict. In this regard, too, there is no dispute that Israeli officials are aware of the existence of an armed conflict, given a war has been declared.\n\nExamining the elements that render starvation a war crime under international\ncriminal law \u2013 in light of the information available to B'Tselem from reports\nby various international bodies and testimonies collected by our field\nresearchers \u2013 yields that Israel has been committing this war crime for\nmonths.\n\nWe recall that under international law, grave crimes considered war crimes,\nsuch as starvation, may carry individual liability for those who commit them.\nArticle 27 of the Rome Statute stipulates that personal liability applies\nregardless of official capacity, such as head of state or any immunity a\nperson might be entitled to by virtue of a ministerial or any other position.\n\nIn Article 28, the Rome Statute stipulates the personal responsibility of\nmilitary commanders and effective civilian superiors.\n\n\u201cA military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander\nshall be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the\nCourt committed by forces under his or her effective command and control, or\neffective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his or her\nfailure to exercise control properly over such forces.\u201d\n\nThis responsibility applies to commanders in one of the following three cases:\n(1) The commander as the direct perpetrator of the offense, (2) The commander\nwho ordered the commission of the offense, (3) The commander as an accomplice\nto the offense.\n\nThe number of senior officials in the IDF and in state institutions who have\ntaken part in denying adequate humanitarian relief to Gaza\u2019s residents in\nrecent months is large, and many of them were presumably aware of their\nactions and the ramifications. Evidence that forces on the ground are aware of\nthe widespread destruction of objects necessary for survival can be found in\nremarks made by Colonel Yogev Bar-Sheshet, Deputy Head of the Civil\nAdministration, in a television interview from inside the Gaza Strip: \"It\ndoesn't pay to hurt our people. That\u2019s the message. There\u2019s nothing left\nthere. Those who come back here, if they come back here after, will find\nscorched earth. No houses. No agriculture. They have no future.\u201d\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\"The current war against the Hamas murderers is another chapter in the story\nof our national resilience through the generations. Remember what Amalek did\nto you.\u201d That is what Binyamin Netanyahu wrote in a message to Israeli\nsoldiers on 3 November 2023, in a dog whistle that anyone who has gone through\nIsrael\u2019s education system will recognize as meaning a response to an attack in\na way that would obliterate any memory of that nation, women and children\nincluded. When the fight against Hamas is compared to the war against Amalek,\nthe conclusion is clear: The order is to wipe out Gaza.\n\nIsrael has been operating for seven months in this spirit, and is succeeding:\ntowns reduced to rubble, an unfathomable death count, a dysfunctional\nhealthcare system and a murky future. Driven by a thirst for revenge over the\ncrimes committed by Hamas on October 7, Israel\u2019s conduct ignores any\nfundamental moral standard and grossly violates its obligations under\ninternational law.\n\nOf the multitude of unacceptable measures Israel is using, starving the\npopulation of Gaza is particularly horrifying. For months, Israel has pursued\na policy of total blockade, complete destruction of the possibility of local\nfood production through farming or fishing, and restrictions on the delivery\nof aid. The result of this policy is millions of starving people.\n\nThe severe hunger that has developed over recent months in the Gaza Strip is\nnot a result of fate, but the product of a deliberate and conscious Israeli\npolicy. It has been openly declared by decision makers, including a member of\nthe Israeli war cabinet, from the very beginning of the war. During Israel\u2019s\nyears of blockade on Gaza, it has studied how much food Gaza\u2019s residents need\nto survive. Israel has drafted mathematical formulae and put together caloric\ntables for this purpose. This means Israel entered the war with a vast amount\nof knowledge about the needs of Gaza\u2019s population, and made a conscious choice\nto deny them.\n\nPushing hundreds of thousands of people into hunger and using starvation as a\nmethod of warfare requires full dehumanization. Sadly, the dehumanization of\nPalestinians in Israeli eyes has accelerated in recent months.\n\nWe hope that highlighting the destructive implications of this policy, as well\nas the personal responsibility of politicians involved in making the decisions\nand the military commanders responsible for implementing them, will lead\nIsrael to understand what should be obvious: starvation can never be used as a\nmethod of warfare. Starving a population is a crime. The moral stain, as well\nas the criminal responsibility created by the Israeli conduct in the last\nmonths, cannot be erased.\n\nFor the full testimonies appearing in this document and other testimonies from\nthe Gaza Strip, see the Voices from Gaza blog on B'Tselem\u2019s website.\n\n[1] Windows of Vulnerability: Consequences of Exposure Timing during the Dutch\nHunger Winter, September 2022; World Health Organization.
