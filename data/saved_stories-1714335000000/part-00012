The original plan for the web offered no way\nto style a website at all.\n\nThere\u2019s a now-infamous post buried in the archives of the WWW mailing list. It\nwas written by Marc Andreessen in 1994, who would go on to co-create both the\nMosaic and Netscape browsers. In the post, Andreessen remarked that because\nthere was no way to style a website with HTML, the only thing he could tell\nweb developers when asked about visual design was, \u201csorry you\u2019re screwed.\u201d\n\n10 years later, CSS was on its way to full adoption by a newly enthused web\ncommunity. *W**hat happened along the way?*\n\n### Finding a Styling Language\n\nThere were plenty of ideas for how the web could theoretically be laid out.\nHowever, it just was not a priority for Berners-Lee because his employers at\nCERN were mostly interested in the web as a digital directory of employees.\nInstead, we got a few competing languages for web page layout from developers\nacross the community, most notably from Pei-Yaun Wei, Andreesen, and H\u00e5kon\nWium Lie.\n\nTake Pei-Yuan Wei, who created the graphical ViolaWWW Browser in 1991. He\nincorporated his own stylesheet language right into his browser, with the\neventual goal of turning this language into an official standard for the web.\nIt never quite got there, but it did provide some much-needed inspiration for\nother potential specifications.\n\nViolaWWW upon release\n\nIn the meantime, Andreessen had taken a different approach in his own browser,\nNetscape Navigator. Instead of creating a decoupled language devoted to a\nwebsite\u2019s style, he simply extended HTML to include presentational,\nunstandardized HTML tags that could be used to design web pages.\nUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t long before web pages lost all semantic value and\nlooked like this:\n\n    \n    \n    <MULTICOL COLS=\"3\" GUTTER=\"25\"> <P><FONT SIZE=\"4\" COLOR=\"RED\">This would be some font broken up into columns</FONT></P> </MULTICOL>\n\nProgrammers were quick to realize that this kind of approach wouldn\u2019t last\nlong. There were plenty of ideas for alternatives. Like RRP, a stylesheet\nlanguage that favored abbreviation and brevity, or PSL96 a language that\nactually allowed for functions and conditional statements. If you\u2019re\ninterested in what these languages looked like, Zach Bloom wrote an excellent\ndeep dive into several competing proposals.\n\nBut the idea that grabbed everyone\u2019s attention was first proposed by H\u00e5kon\nWium Lie in October of 1994. It was called Cascading Style Sheets, or just\nCSS.\n\n### Why We Use CSS\n\nCSS stood out because it was simple, especially compared to some of its\nearliest competitors.\n\n    \n    \n    window.margin.left = 2cm font.family = times h1.font.size = 24pt 30%\n\nCSS is a declarative programming language. When we write CSS, we don\u2019t tell\nthe browser exactly how to render a page. Instead, we describe the rules for\nour HTML document one by one and let browsers handle the rendering. Keep in\nmind that the web was mostly being built by amateur programmers and ambitious\nhobbyists. CSS followed a predictable and perhaps more importantly, forgiving\nformat and just about anyone could pick it up. That\u2019s a feature, not a bug.\n\nCSS was, however, unique in a singular way. It allowed for styles to cascade.\nIt\u2019s right there in the name. Cascading Style Sheets. The cascade means that\nstyles can inherit and overwrite other styles that had previously been\ndeclared, following a fairly complicated hierarchy known as specificity. The\nbreakthrough, though, was that it allowed for multiple stylesheets on the same\npage.\n\nSee that percentage value above? That\u2019s actually a pretty important bit. Lie\nbelieved that both users and designers would define styles in separate\nstylesheets. The browser, then, could act as a sort of mediator between the\ntwo, and negotiate the differences to render a page. That percentage\nrepresents just how much ownership this stylesheet is taking for a property.\nThe less ownership, the more likely it was to be overwritten by users. When\nLie first demoed CSS, he even showed off a slider that allowed him to toggle\nbetween user-defined and developer-defined styles in the browser.\n\nThis was actually a pretty big debate in the early days of CSS. Some believed\nthat developers should have complete control. Others that the user should be\nin control. In the end, the percentages were removed in favor of more clearly\ndefined rules about which CSS definitions would overwrite others. Anyway,\nthat\u2019s why we have specificity.\n\nShortly after Lie published his original proposal, he found a partner in Bert\nBos. Bos had created the Argo browser, and in the process, his own stylesheet\nlanguage, pieces of which eventually made its way into CSS. The two began\nworking out a more detailed specification, eventually turning to the newly\ncreated HTML working group at the W3C for help.\n\nIt took a few years, but by the end of 1996, the above example had changed.\n\n    \n    \n    html { margin-left: 2cm; font-family: \"Times\", serif; } h1 { font-size: 24px; }\n\nCSS had arrived.\n\n### The Trouble with Browsers\n\nWhile CSS was still just a draft, Netscape had pressed on with presentational\nHTML elements like multicol, layer, and the dreaded blink tag. Internet\nExplorer, on the other hand, had taken to incorporating some of CSS piecemeal.\nBut their support was spotty and, at times, incorrect. Which means that by the\nearly aughts, after five years of CSS as an official recommendation, there\nwere still no browsers with full CSS support.\n\nThat came from kind of a strange place.\n\nWhen Tantek \u00c7elik joined Internet Explorer for Macintosh in 1997, his team was\npretty small. A year later, he was made the lead developer of the rendering\nengine at the same as his team was cut in half. Most of the focus for\nMicrosoft (for obvious reasons) was on the Windows version of Internet\nExplorer, and the Macintosh team was mostly left to their own devices. So\nStarting with the development of version 5 in 2000, \u00c7elik and his team decided\nto put their focus where no one else was, CSS support.\n\nIt would take the team two years to finish version 5. During this time, \u00c7elik\nspoke frequently with members of the W3C and web designers using their\nbrowser. As each piece slid into place, the IE-for-Mac team verified on all\nfronts that they were getting things just right. Finally, in March of 2002,\nthey shipped Internet Explorer 5 for Macintosh. The first browser with full\nCSS Level 1 support.\n\n### Doctype Switching\n\nBut remember, the Windows version of Internet Explorer had added CSS to their\nbrowser with more than a few bugs and a screwy box model, which describes the\nway elements are calculated and then rendered. Internet Explorer included\nattributes like border and padding inside the total width and height of an\nelement. But IE5 for Mac, and the official CSS specification called for these\nvalues to be added to the width and height. If you ever played around with\nbox-sizing you know exactly the difference.\n\n\u00c7elik knew that in order to make CSS work, these differences would need to be\nreconciled. His solution came after a conversation with standards-advocate\nTodd Fahrner. It\u2019s called doctype switching, and it works like this.\n\nWe all know doctypes. They go at the very top of our HTML documents.\n\n    \n    \n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n\nBut in the old days, they looked like this:\n\n    \n    \n    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd\">\n\nThat\u2019s an example of a standards-compliant doctype. The //W3C//DTD HTML\n4.0//EN is the crucial bit. When a web designer added this to their page the\nbrowser would know to render the page in \u201cstandards mode,\u201d and CSS would match\nthe specification. If the doctype was missing, or an out of date one was in\nuse, the browser would switch to \u201cquirks mode\u201d and render things according to\nthe old box model and with old bugs intact. Some designers even intentionally\nopted to put their site into quirks mode in order to get back the older (and\nincorrect) box model.\n\nEric Meyer, sometimes referred to as the godfather of CSS, has gone on record\nand said doctype switching saved CSS. He\u2019s probably right. We would still be\nusing browsers packed with old CSS bugs if it weren\u2019t for that one, simple\ntrick.\n\n### The Box Model Hack\n\nThere was one last thing to figure out. Doctype switching worked fine in\nmodern browsers on older websites, but the box model was still unreliable in\nolder browsers (particularly Internet Explorer) for newer websites. Enter the\nBox Model Hack, a clever trick from \u00c7elik that took advantage of a little-used\nCSS attribute called voice-family to trick browsers and allow for multiple\nwidths and heights in the same class. \u00c7elik instructed authors to put their\nold box model width first, then close the tag in a small hack with voice-\nfamily, followed by their new box model width. Sort of like this:\n\n    \n    \n    div.content { width: 400px; voice-family: \"\"}\"\"; voice-family: inherit; width: 300px; }\n\nVoice-family was not recognized in older browsers, but it did accept a string\nas its definition. So by adding an extra } older browsers would simply close\nthe CSS rule before ever getting to that second width. It was simple and\neffective and let a lot of designers start experimenting with new standards\nquickly.\n\n### The Pioneers of Standards-Based Design\n\nInternet Explorer 6 was released in 2001. It would eventually become a major\nthorn in the side of web developers everywhere, but it actually shipped with\nsome pretty impressive CSS and standards support. Not to mention its market\nshare hovering around 80%.\n\nThe stage was set, the pieces were in place. CSS was ready for production. Now\npeople just needed to use it.\n\nIn the 10 years that the web hurtled towards ubiquity without a coherent or\nstandard styling language, it\u2019s not like designers had simply stopped\ndesigning. Not at all. Instead, they relied on a backlog of browser hacks,\ntable-based layouts, and embedded Flash files to add some style when HTML\ncouldn\u2019t. Standards-compliant, CSS-based design was new territory. What the\nweb needed was some pioneers to hack a path forward.\n\nWhat they got was two major redesigns just a few months apart. The first from\nWired followed soon after by ESPN.\n\nDouglas Bowman was in charge of the web design team for Wired magazine. In\n2002, Bowman and his team looked around and saw that no major sites were using\nCSS in their designs. Bowman felt almost an obligation to a web community that\nlooked to Wired for examples of best practices to redesign their site using\nthe latest, standards-compliant HTML and CSS. He pushed his team to tear\neverything down and redesign it from scratch. In September of 2002, they\npulled it off and launched their redesign. The site even validated.\n\nESPN released their site just a few months later, using many of the same\ntechniques on an even larger scale. These sites took a major bet on CSS, a\ntechnology that some thought might not even last. But it paid off in a major\nway. If you pulled aside any of the developers that worked on these redesigns,\nthey would give you a laundry list of major benefits. More performant, faster\ndesign changes, easier to share, and above all, good for the web. Wired even\ndid daily color changes in the beginning.\n\nDig through the code of these redesigns, and you\u2019d be sure to find some hacks.\nThe web still only lived on a few different monitor sizes, so you may notice\nthat both sites used a combination of fixed width columns and relative and\nabsolute positioning to slot a grid into place. Images were used in place of\ntext. But these sites laid the groundwork for what would come next.\n\n### CSS Zen Garden and the Semantic Web\n\nThe following year, in 2003, Jeffrey Zeldman published his book Designing with\nWeb Standards, which became a sort of handbook for web designers looking to\nswitch to standards-based design. It kicked off a legacy of CSS techniques and\ntricks that helped web designers imagine what CSS could do. A year later, Dave\nShea launched the CSS Zen Garden, which encouraged designers to take a basic\nHTML page and lay it out differently using just CSS. The site became a\nshowcase of the latest tips and tricks, and went a long way towards convincing\nfolks it was time for standards.\n\nSlowly but surely, the momentum built. CSS advanced, and added new attributes.\nBrowsers actually raced to implement the latest standards, and designers and\ndevelopers added new tricks to their repertoire. And eventually, CSS became\nthe norm. Like it had been there all along.\n\nEnjoy learning about web history?

Ben\n\nPermalink to comment# October 18, 2017\n\nBrowser support is a key in CSS implementation. By the end of the 90\u2019s, IE5\nwas taking the lead over Netscape4. And Netscape 6 came out with a breaking\nchange, supporting already a lot of CSS and way better, but so differently, it\nwas not widely adopted and IE6 buried it. But Netscape didn\u2019t completely\ndied... the phoenix came back through Mozilla 1.0, using the open source code\nof Netscape. Eventually Firefox came out of it as well and advocated so much\nfor standard that IE6 became the official ugly duckling. And Safari, and\nChrome...\n\nWe used to struggle with 2 or 3 resolution (640\u00d7480, 800\u00d7600, 1024\u00d7768; these\nwere for desktop you younglings!). Then with ways to handle JS between IE and\nNetscape (remember document.all vs document.layers?) Then with CSS\ninconsistencies (double-margin bug, IE hacks...). Now we just have 250 screen\nresolutions. Piece of cake!\n\n  5.

I learned to take a very close to stock HTML structure and turn it\ninto almost any layout. It really opened my eyes to what CSS could do for web\ndesigners and developers.\n\nI hope the react css-in-js nuts don\u2019t wreck future web standards that created\nthe beauty in simplicity that is modern CSS. I am all for doing what needs to\nget done, but we got here for a reason.\n\nA bit of memory lane here, ty. (not missing the old days of design, that is\nfor sure)\n\n  6.

It was the border, not the margin that was part of the\nbox\u2019s dimensions (width/height).\n\n  7. Zeldman\n\nPermalink to comment# October 22, 2017\n\nGood stuff. But you omitted The Web Standards Project, without which none of\nthis would\u2019ve happened. Tantek and Eric did what they did as participants in\nWaSP-led initiatives. A List Apart\u2019s promotion of WaSP values to designers and\ndevelopers and early use of CSS layout inspired what Doug and Mike did at\nWired and ESPN, respectively. Dozens of WaSP members and thousands of eventual\nsupporters drove this movement. Their contributions deserve to be remembered.\n\n     * Jason Hoffman\n\nPermalink to comment# October 23, 2017\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks for pointing that out!\n\nI didn\u2019t include it in this post, but you are absolutely right that it would\nhave fit. WaSP is an organization I find myself coming back to over and over\nagain in the newsletter I send out every week, though I\u2019ve never had a chance\nto tell the full history of WaSP, and it\u2019s incredible influence over the web\u2019s\ntrajectory, something I most certainly want to do. If you ever had some time,\nI would love to quickly chat with you about what it was like joining and\nleading WaSP so that I can make sure I have everything right. Either way, I\ndefinitely want to tell that story and I hope that when I do, I do the project\nand its members, who I agree we owe an enormous debt of gratitude and need to\nbe remembered, justice.\n\n  8. Justin\n\nPermalink to comment# October 22, 2017\n\nAnd it\u2019s not over yet! IE still has its annoying quirks and is going strong!\n\n     * Vanderson\n\nPermalink to comment# October 23, 2017\n\nAre you sure IE isn\u2019t mostly dead? I can\u2019t think of a good reason to support\nanything lower than IE 10 (only because of windows 7), and it\u2019s not super\nhorrible with CSS anymore.\n\nRanding from 3.5% \u2013 14.8%\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers\n\nThere\u2019s a note that says theses are the \u201cnon-mobile\u201d list, so this cuts these\nvalues in real world terms in more than half. So the actual percentage of IE\nuse on the net is more like 1.5% \u2013 7%, being very generous.\n\nAnd considering these are worldwider numbers, and many designers focus on the\nbusinesses in their own countries (US for my company), this makes this number\neven less relevant.\n\nThe final nail in the IE coffin is that MS doesn\u2019t even support IE anymore.\nAnd if a client says their site doesn\u2019t look good/correct in their browser, I\npoint out the security implications of using unsupported browser and they\nupgrade and the problem goes away.\n\nLast but not least, if a client wants to support IE, I simply provide an\nestimate of costs to support it, with a known percentage of users with IE, and\n100% of the time, they decline to pay for IE support.\n\n     * Jonathan\n\nPermalink to comment# October 25, 2017\n\nVanderson, how about the UK\u2019s National Health Service \u2013 the fifth largest\nemployer in the world. I.E. 7 rules the roost there...\n\n     * Vanderson\n\nPermalink to comment# October 25, 2017\n\n> how about the UK\u2019s National Health Service \u2013 the fifth largest employer in\n> the world. I.E. 7 rules the roost there...\n\nChoice and Common Sense First off, I let my clients decide, and they pay for\nthe support. Can\u2019t give away a potentially large percentage of the cost of\nproject for free.\n\nSecond, know your market and users. I am in the US, and most of my clients are\nbusinesses, small to medium (I tend not to want to work with huge companies\nanymore, as they drain the life out of you) and they don\u2019t have any site\nvisitors (existing sites with stats) that use IE 7 anymore. So it\u2019s completely\na non-issue there. (or if they do, it\u2019s so small it\u2019s not worth it for them to\npay for the support... again, their choice)\n\nLast, it hits a point where you just have to move on. IE 6 hung around a\nreally long time. And despite it\u2019s solid percent of users, I (and I bet\neveryone else here) had to just cut support and let IE 6 users see a messy\nsite.\n\nEven you are deciding right now to cut support for something. Where is the\nline? How do you choose where the cutoff line is? Factor in all the data you\ncan, and make an educated, common sense choice.\n\nAlso, I propose that there is a massive difference in development standards\nwhen you build for only 1 website, vs hundreds or even thousands of websites.\n(especially if it\u2019s a government or huge corp website)\n\nSecurity 2006 is when IE 7 was released.\n\nTimeline of browser history\n\nHow many people here support Safari 2 or Firefox 1.5, Netscape 8.1 or Opera 9?\nChrome didn\u2019t even exist for another 2 years, iOS and Android did not exist\nfor another year or more. But throw in the first versions of all mobile\nbrowsers to this list then. (including the Android browser)\n\nI\u2019d surmise you don\u2019t support any these browsers.\n\nTo make matters worse, by supporting IE 7 (actually anything lower than IE\n11), you are actively promoting the use of an insecure browser (insecure for\nover a year and half now!)\n\n> ... the April 2016 security update the last ever public update for IE7.\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7\n\nHaving things look bad in IE 7 is a GOOD thing. It is the smallest thing we\ncan do as designers (short of an actual message) to help people realize they\nare using an insecure browser.\n\nI think it\u2019s our duty as webdesigners to instantly stop all support for any\nand all browsers that no longer receive security updates from their\ndevelopers.\n\nHow can you in good conscience knowingly make a site look correct in a browser\nthat is pretty much guaranteed to hurt the user?\n\nAgain, that is 1 and 1/2 years of insecure IE 7, and who knows about the\nothers... The only version of IE that is getting security updates is version\n11.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/end-of-ie-support\n\n  9.
