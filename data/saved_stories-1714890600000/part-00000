It\u2019s designed to make the integration process of observability into\nGenAI projects as easy as pie \u2013 literally, with just a single line of code.\nWhether you\u2019re working with popular LLM Libraries such as OpenAI and\nHuggingFace or leveraging vector databases like ChromaDB, OpenLIT ensures your\napplications are monitored seamlessly, providing critical insights to improve\nperformance and reliability.\n\nThis project proudly follows the Semantic Conventions of the OpenTelemetry\ncommunity, consistently updating to align with the latest standards in\nobservability.\n\n##\n\nWhat is LIT?\n\nLIT stands for Learning Interpretability Tool. It refers to a visual,\ninteractive model-understanding and data visualization tool ad a term\nintroduced by Google.\n\n##\n\n\u26a1 Features\n\n  * OpenTelemetry-native: Native support ensures that integrating OpenLIT into your projects feels more like a natural extension rather than an additional layer of complexity.\n  * Granular Usage Insights of your LLM Applications: Assess your LLM\u2019s performance and costs with fine-grained control, breaking down metrics by environment (such as staging or production) or application, to optimize for efficiency and scalability.\n  * Vendor-Neutral SDKs: In the spirit of OpenTelemetry, OpenLIT\u2019s SDKs are agnostic of the backend vendors. This means you can confidently use OpenLIT with various telemetry backends, like Grafana Tempo, without worrying about compatibility issues.\n\n##\n\nGetting Started\n\nSelect from the following guides to learn more about how to use OpenLIT:\n\n## Quickstart\n\nGet Started with monitoring your LLM Applications in 2 simple steps\n\n## Integrations\n\nIntegrate your LLM Provider with OpenLIT\n\n## Installation\n\nDeploy OpenLIT in your preferred environment\n\n## Connections\n\nConnect to your existing Observablity Platform\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nSuggest edits\n\nQuickstart\n\ngithubslacktwitterdiscord\n\nPowered by Mintlify\n\n  * What is LIT?\n  * \u26a1 Features\n  * Getting Started\n\n", "frontpage": false}
