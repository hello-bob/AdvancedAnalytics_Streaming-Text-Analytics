Poincare [4] found that the first integrals for the\nmotion of three-body system do not exist, and besides orbits of three-body\nsystem are rather sensitive to initial conditions. His discovery of the so-\ncalled \"sensitivity dependence on initial conditions\" (SDIC) laid the\nfoundation of modern chaos theory. It well explains why in the 300 years only\nthree families of periodic orbits of three-body system were found by Euler [2]\nand Lagrange [3], until 1970s when the Broucke-Hadjidemetriou-Henon family of\nperiodic orbits were found [5-9]. The famous figure-eight family was\nnumerically discovered by Moore [10] in 1993 and rediscovered by Chenciner and\nMontgomery [11] in 2000. In 2013, Suvakov and Dmitrasinovic [12] made a\nbreakthrough to find 13 new distinct periodic orbits by means of numerical\nmethods, which belong to 11 new families. In 2017 Li and Liao [13] found more\nthan six hundred new periodic orbits of three-body system with equal mass, and\nin 2018 Li et al. [14] further reported more than one thousand new periodic\norbits of three-body system with unequal mass. In 2018, Li and Liao [15]\nreported more than three hundred new collisionless periodic orbits in free-\nfall three-body problem. In 2021, Li et al. [16] successfully obtained 135445\nnew periodic orbits with arbitrarily unequal masses by means of combining the\nnumerical continuation method and the Newton-Raphson method, including 13315\nstable ones. In 2022, Liao et al. [17] proposed an effective approach and\nroadmap to numerically gain planar periodic orbits of three-body systems with\narbitrary masses by means of machine learning based on an artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) model.\n\nThe following show the details of our newly found periodic orbits.\n\n1\\. Periodic orbits with equal mass\n\nFIG1. The trajectories of six new periodic orbits with equal mass. Blue line:\nbody-1, red line: body-2, black line: body-3.\n\nOn April 28th 2017, we reported 164 families of planar periodic orbits of the\nthree-body system with equal mass and zero angular momentum in case of initial\nconditions with isosceles collinear configuration, including the well-known\nFigure-eight family found by Moore in 1993, the 11 families found by Suvakov\nand Dmitrasinovic in 2013, and more than 100 new families that have been never\nreported. They are found by means of the search grid 1000 * 1000 for the\ninitial velocities [0,1] * [0,1] within a time interval [0,100]. For more\ndetail, please refer to arXiv:1705.00527v2.\n\nOn May 30th 2017, we further reported 695 families (including the previous 164\nones) of planar periodic orbits of the three-body system with equal mass and\nzero angular momentum in case of initial conditions with isosceles collinear\nconfiguration. They are found by means of the search grid 4000 * 4000 for the\ninitial velocities [0,1] * [0,1] within a larger time interval [0,200]. More\nthan 600 among them have been never reported, to the best of our knowledge.\nFor more detail, please refer to arXiv:1705.00527v3.\n\nOn July 11th 2017, the final version was updated on ArXiv, mainly for the\nmodification of the names of these 695 families of periodic orbits of the\nthree-body problems.

Periodic orbits with unequal mass\n\nFIG2. The trajectories of six new periodic orbits with unequal mass. Blue\nline: body-1, red line: body-2, black line: body-3.\n\nOn September 13th 2017, we reported 1349 families of Newtonian periodic planar\nthree-body orbits with unequal mass and zero angular momentum and the initial\nconditions in case of isosceles collinear configurations. These 1349 families\nof the periodic collisionless orbits can be divided into seven classes\naccording to their geometric and algebraic symmetries. Among these 1349\nfamilies, 1223 families are entirely new, to the best of our knowledge. For\nmore detail, please refer to arXiv:1709.04775 and website.

Blue line: body-1, red line: body-2, black line: body-3.\n\nOn May 21th 2018, we reported 316 collisionless periodic free-fall three-body\norbits with different mass ratios, including 313 entirely new collisionless\nperiodic orbits.

Stable non-hierarchical triple systems with fairly large mass region\n\nFIG4. Three newly found stable periodic orbits of non-hierarchical triple\nsystems with different masses and period. (a) m_1 = 0.87, m_2 = 0.8, m_3 = 1\nand T = 5.9889127121; (b) m_1 = 0.9, m_2 = 0.85, m_3 = 1 and T = 6.3508660391;\n(c) m_1 = 0.93, m_2 = 0.89, m_3 = 1 and T = 6.6805531109. Body-1: blue line;\nBody-2: red line; Body-3: black line.\n\nFIG5. The stability region of periodic orbits with m_3 = 1 in the m_1-m_2\nplane. Shadowing domain: stable periodic orbits.\n\nIt has traditionally been believed that non-hierarchical triple systems would\nbe unstable and thus should disintegrate into a stable binary system and a\nsingle star, and consequently stable periodic orbits of non-hierarchical\ntriple systems have been expected to be rather scarce. However, we report here\none family of 135445 periodic orbits of non-hierarchical triple systems with\nunequal masses (see supplementary): 13315 among them are stable. Compared with\nthe narrow mass range (only 10^-5) in which stable \"Figure-eight\" periodic\norbits of three-body systems exist, our newly found stable periodic orbits\nhave fairly large mass region as shown in FIG5. We find that many of these\nnumerically found stable non-hierarchical periodic orbits have mass ratios\nclose to those of hierarchical triple systems that have been measured with\nastronomical observations. This implies that these stable periodic orbits of\nnon-hierarchical triple systems with distinctly unequal masses quite possibly\ncan be observed in practice.\n\nFor more details, please refer to:\n\nXiaoming Li, Xiaochen Li and Shijun Liao, \"One family of 13315 stable periodic\norbits of non-hierarchical unequal-mass triple systems\", Science China\nPhysics, Mechanics & Astronomy, 64 (2021), 219511\n(doi:10.1007/s11433-020-1624-7).

The relatively periodic BHH satellites orbits of the three-body system\nwith various masses in a rotating frame of reference. The corresponding\nphysical parameters are given by ANN in Table 3 in [PDF]. Blue line: body-1;\nred line: body-2; black line: body-3.\n\nFIG7. The relatively periodic BHH satellites orbits of the three-body system\nwith various masses in a rotating frame of reference. The corresponding\nphysical parameters are given by ANN in Table 4 in [PDF]. Blue line: body-1;\nred line: body-2; black line: body-3.\n\nWe propose an effective approach and roadmap to numerically gain planar\nperiodic orbits of three-body systems with arbitrary masses by means of\nmachine learning based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Given any\na known periodic orbit as a starting point, this approach can provide more and\nmore periodic orbits (of the same family name) with variable masses, while the\nmass domain having periodic orbits becomes larger and larger, and the ANN\nmodel becomes wiser and wiser. Finally, we have an ANN model trained by means\nof all obtained periodic orbits of the same family, which provides a\nconvenient way to give accurate enough predictions of periodic orbits with\narbitrary masses for physicists and astronomers. It suggests that the high-\nperformance computer and artificial intelligence (including machine learning)\nshould be the key to gain periodic orbits of the famous three-body problem.\n\nFor more details, please refer to:\n\nShijun Liao, Xiaoming Li and Yu Yang, \"Three-body problem - from Newton to\nsupercomputer plus machine learning\", New Astronomy, 96 (2022), 101850\n(doi:10.1016/j.newast.2022.101850).
