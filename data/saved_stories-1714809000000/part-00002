Daniel Dennett, who was exceptional in so\nmany ways, and who died last month, was for me an exception to this rule, too.\n\nLike so many, I was first inspired by Dennett on reading one of his many\nbestsellers: Consciousness Explained. It was 1991 and I was a fresh\nundergraduate with a powerful but undirected interest in consciousness. I had\nno idea how to go about studying it, or how to think about it. I was studying\nphysics at Cambridge and had just plowed my way through Roger Penrose\u2019s The\nEmperor\u2019s New Mind, which had left me confused and despondent. Dennett\u2019s book,\nwith its presumptuous but oh-so-appealing title, was both a tease and a salve.\nI devoured it.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nI didn\u2019t agree with, or follow, everything. But I learned so much from his\nclear, witty writing, and from his famous \u201cintuition pump\u201d thought\nexperiments. I was left with the strong impression that consciousness, if not\nexplained, was explainable, and I now had a north star to steer by.\n\n> Learning from him could sometimes feel like looking straight at the sun.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nYears passed. I thought I might meet him when he examined the doctoral thesis\nof a friend of mine who was studying with me at the University of Sussex, but\nit turned out they met over Skype. I would hear stories about him from one of\nmy mentors at the University of Sussex and one of Dennett\u2019s great friends, the\nphilosopher Maggie Boden. These were tales of philosophical bust-ups, of\nsailing adventures, and of a voracious and seemingly unbounded intellectual\nappetite. The impression was of someone larger-than-life, who delighted in\nengaging with the world rather than preaching from an ivory tower. I read\nevery book he wrote, and many of his papers. But the man himself remained\nremote.\n\nI finally met Dennett in 2016. I\u2019d recently joined a group of researchers at\nthe Brain, Mind, and Consciousness Program of the Canadian Institute for\nAdvanced Research, where Dennett had served as a long-time advisor. I remember\nfeeling nervous when approaching him in the hotel bar before one of our\nmeetings to say hello for the first time, but I needn\u2019t have worried. Dennett\nwas as approachable and avuncular in person as he was esteemed and revered in\nacademia. Which is very. I don\u2019t remember what we talked about then, but in\nthe conversations and email exchanges that followed over the years he\nunfailingly exuded kindness, intellectual generosity, and perspicuity. He\nwould tell you exactly what he thought, and he had the ability to do so in a\nway that made you feel improved, rather than dumb for making some stupid\nmistake.\n\nTwo examples stand out. The first is from seven years ago. I was in Vancouver,\nabout to give a TED talk, and I was terrified. There were hundreds of\ninfluential people watching in person, and thousands more online. The next 16\nminutes could be transformational or a total flop. But of all the people there\nwhose opinions might matter, the one person I really didn\u2019t want to disappoint\nwas Dan Dennett.\n\nAfterward, amid the high-fiving and catharsis, I noticed a short tweet from\nDennett.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n\u201cAlmost perfect but not quite.\u201d This combination of generosity and gentle\ncriticism was typical. And he was right. In my talk I\u2019d made the mistake of\nusing the phrase \u201cinner movie\u201d to describe the multisensory immersive nature\nof conscious experience. But an inner movie implies an inner movie-watcher, a\nCartesian homunculus of exactly the sort that Dennett\u2014and I\u2014wanted to expunge.\nThis wasn\u2019t a technicality. It was a give-away that I hadn\u2019t really\ninternalized the insight.\n\nThe second example was from a pandemic year. I was finalizing the first draft\nof my book Being You and, with some hesitation, I\u2019d asked Dan if he\u2019d be\nwilling to consider writing a blurb for the cover. He declined,\ndisarmingly\u2014explaining that he\u2019d decided some time back not to do any more\nblurbs, and if he changed his mind for me he\u2019d risk upsetting many of his\ncolleagues and friends he\u2019d already said no to. But to my amazement he offered\nsomething much more valuable. He said he would set the draft as the reading\nfor his next course at Tufts University, and then we could have two or three\nlong Zoom sessions going through each chapter in detail with him and his class\nof talented students. It still astounds me that he took the time to do this,\nbut he did, and the discussions we had in these sessions improved the book no\nend.\n\nTHE GENTLE GIANT: Anil Seth with his personal hero Daniel Dennett. Seth was\nstruck by Dennett\u2019s combination of kindness, intellectual generosity, and\nperspicuity\u2014his talent for gentle criticism that made one feel improved rather\nthan chastened.

I found myself coming round to his way\nof thinking on many things: the centrality of evolution for understanding the\nmind, how to think about free will (though in 2021 we found ourselves on\nopposite sides of a debate on the topic), and of course the absence of\u2014or any\nneed for\u2014an inner observer, homunculus, or theater in the brain where\neverything \u201ccomes together.\u201d But learning from him could sometimes feel like\nlooking straight at the sun. I had to look away, to approach things sidelong,\nsparking the worry that I\u2019d never fully grasp the weight of his arguments.\n\nDennett was often described as a philosophical \u201cillusionist,\u201d a position\nsometimes caricatured as saying that consciousness doesn\u2019t exist. (A criticism\nof his 1991 book was that it should\u2019ve been called Consciousness Explained\nAway.) But illusionism doesn\u2019t, in fact, say this. On one reading, it says we\nare mistaken to think that the relationship between consciousness and\nphysical, biological processes in the brain is a big mystery\u2014the mystery that\nfellow philosopher David Chalmers calls the \u201chard problem\u201d of consciousness.\nOn another reading, which I\u2019m more sympathetic to, it says that consciousness\nexists, but it might not be what we think it is\u2014in the same way that the color\nred exists, but is not what we might think it is\u2014there is no redness out there\nin the world nor is there a red \u201cfigment\u201d in the mind, to borrow another of\nDennett\u2019s delightful terms.\n\nI always looked forward to discussing these ideas with Dennett, and to\nchatting about them with my colleagues and friends, all of us trying to figure\nout what Dennett might really be thinking. One dimension of the sense of loss\nI now feel is that these discussions will become historical, a matter of\ninterpretation and exegesis, rather than the living, vital process they so\nrecently were.\n\nIn his later years, Dennett was fond of riffing on Chalmers\u2019 hard problem with\nwhat he called the \u201chard question\u201d: Once some (mental) content reaches\nconsciousness, \u201cthen what happens?\u201d This was his way of sending up the many\ntheories that propose that conscious experience might somehow arise out of, or\nemerge from, this-or-that aspect of brain activity. Neurons fire in synchrony?\nOr with a certain form of complexity? And then what happens? In his diagnosis,\nthe struggles of consciousness science lay in the systematic failure to\nproperly ask, and answer, this question.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

He leaves an unmatched legacy in his\nbooks and papers, in how he brought philosophy and science together, and in\nthe legions of students and researchers he taught and inspired. He was, I will\nassume, a materialist to the end. And in dying, perhaps Dan put his\nmaterialist beliefs to the ultimate test. And then what happens?\n\nLead image: Master1305 / Shutterstock\n\n  * ###### Anil Seth\n\nPosted on May 2, 2024\n\nAnil Seth is Professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience and\nDirector of the Centre for Consciousness Science at the University of Sussex.\nHe is also Co-Director of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Program\non Brain, Mind, and Consciousness, and author of the bestselling book Being\nYou\u2014A New Science of Consciousness.\n\n#### Get the Nautilus newsletter\n\nCutting-edge science, unraveled by the very brightest living thinkers.\n\nZoology\n\nInsects and Other Animals Have Consciousness\n\nEnvironment\n\nSardines Are Feeling the Squeeze\n\nTechnology\n\nConsciousness, Creativity, and Godlike AI\n\n  * Explore\n\n## Sardines Are Feeling the Squeeze\n\n    * By Elena Kazamia\n    * May 3, 2024\n    * Environment\n\nClimate change and overfishing are decimating sardines in the Philippines.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## 10 Brilliant Insights from Daniel Dennett\n\n    * By Dan Falk\n    * May 1, 2024\n    * Philosophy\n\nA glimpse of a mind jammed to the rafters with ideas.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## Can Chatbots Hold Meaningful Conversations?\n\n    * By Elena Kazamia\n    * April 5, 2024\n    * Technology\n\nTraining AI to read novels might help.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## What a Bronze Age Skeleton Reveals About Cavities\n\n    * By Katharine Gammon\n    * April 4, 2024\n    * History\n\nHere\u2019s a hint: He didn\u2019t eat processed foods and sugar.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## Archaeology at the Bottom of the Sea\n\n    * By David Gibbins\n    * April 2, 2024\n    * History\n\nDavid Gibbins on his 3 greatest revelations while writing A History of the\nWorld in Twelve Shipwrecks.\n\n## NAUTILUS: SCIENCE CONNECTED\n\nNautilus is a different kind of science magazine.
