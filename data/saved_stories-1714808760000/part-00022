A significant\nplanning event, a technical design session for a major component, implementing\na new productivity tool.\n\nPhew, it looks like I am just in time! A few days later and they would have\ntotally messed up that quarterly plan. They are going to use what technology\nto solve that? So much to do, so little time! It is fixable, but only if\neveryone stops what they are doing and listens to me right now!\n\nOr maybe not. I want to share a couple of techniques that I have adopted over\nthe years that have helped me to resist the urge to Fix All The Things.\n\nThe idea that I should hold back when I first arrive somewhere is one of the\nmost important consulting truths I have learned, and one I wish I had known a\ncouple of decades sooner. You need to make your peace with the idea that you\nwill not \u201cfix\u201d it this time.\n\nIf it helps, there are two things to bear in mind: they would have messed up\nwhether you were there or not; and it is probably not as serious as you think.\n\n## Fix the Next One \u00b6\n\nSomething sucks. Maybe several things suck. That is why they hired you in the\nfirst place. Unless your objective is to \u201cfix this design decision, today\u201d,\nthe likely goal is to help people make better choices in the future.\n\nWork in motion wants to stay in motion. In-flight initiatives tend to have\npolitical as well as human momentum, and the energy and effort required to\nstop the moving train is likely to be greater than you think. Ensuring future\ntrains go in a good direction is a better investment of your time.\n\nAccepting that you will not fix the plan for this quarter, or the design for\nthis component, is oddly liberating. You may not even make the headway you\nneed to fix the next one. But the one after that? Well that is definitely up\nfor grabs!\n\nBy observing how something fails, you can learn a lot about where a team or\norganisation is. The specific case does not matter, you are interested in the\npatterns of failure. Now you know where to start work. I call this technique\nFix the Next One.\n\nThe flip side of all of this is that you might be wrong! Perhaps the way they\nprioritise work, or make technical decisions, is exactly right for this\ncontext. You saw a fence in the road, and you jumped to conclusions about what\nneeded to happen.\n\nWhen you \u201cseek first to understand\u201d, you gain an empathy for your client and\ntheir circumstance which may inform your approach to engaging with and\nsupporting them.\n\n## The Rule of 63 \u00b6\n\nA related phenomenon starts in a similar way...\n\nWhenever you arrive in a new context, you will see a whole pile of things that\nyou would just love to sort out. If only these people could just...\ncommunicate better, work in smaller chunks, have more effective meetings,\nresolve that silly political spat, take a moment to listen to that quiet\ndeveloper who clearly understands what is going on, care about that build,\ndocument or even automate that weird query they seem to run every three days.\n\nThe thing is, this is just how they get work done. If you point it out, they\nwill still do it because this is what works. And you can\u2019t fix the world\novernight. And they don\u2019t know what you know. And you don\u2019t know what they\nknow. And you may be wrong about a bunch of this anyway!\n\nI call this phenomenon of walking into a new environment and wanting to fix\nthings my Rule of 63, and it is one of my core consulting strategies. I do not\nremember where I came across this, or whether I named it myself, but I am\ngrateful for the patient mentors who implanted the idea.\n\nWhen I enter a new context, I assume that I will see 63 things that need\nfixing, and I resolve to pick three! What are the three biggest, baddest, most\nimpactful or painful things that I can see right now? What is the best way in\nwhich I can help or serve?\n\nThen I decide to focus on those and those alone, and just suck up the other\n60! I will do nothing about anything else. I will thrive in the filth that is\ntheir multi-hour, flaky build; I will relish in their pointless box-ticking\nstatus meetings; I will bite my tongue as the alpha male talks across the\nsmart-but-quiet junior developer; say nothing about their repetitive, error-\nprone manual processes. All this can wait.\n\nOnce you tackle those three, go back for the next three. Now you are only\nsucking up 57 things that need fixing while you work on the next ones, and so\non. Eventually you will have tackled the big issues with them.\n\nIf you are doing it right, not only will they have learned how to navigate\nthese issues, they will have learned how to tackle the remaining ones\nthemselves. This is double-loop learning: not only learning how to change\nthings, but learning how to engage with change.\n\n## tl; dr \u00b6\n\nThis is one of the toughest lessons I have learned as a consultant. If I try\nto solve All The Things, I fall victim to Jerry Weinberg\u2019s law of raspberry\njam: \u201cThe wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.\"\n\nInstead, if I ignore the distraction of This Thing Now and focus on how we got\nhere, and if I choose to prioritise and make my peace with the residual noise,\nI am more likely to create lasting impact, and my clients will thank me long\nafter the current crisis has played itself out.\n\n  * consulting\n\nThis content by Daniel Terhorst-North is licensed under CC BY 4.0\n\n#### Speaking\n\nKotlinConf, Copenhagen| 23-24 May  \n---|---  \nCraftConf, Budapest| 30-31 May  \nGOTO Amsterdam| 11-12 June  \nGOTO Copenhagen| 2-4 October  \n  \n#### Recent Posts\n\n  * Using Hugo as a redirect service\n  * McKinsey Developer Productivity Review\n  * The Worst Programmer I Know\n  * Advice to a New Speaker\n  * Seek First to Understand\n\n#### Social\n\nTwitter\n\nMastodon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nAbout | Tags | Contact | Legal\n\n\u00a9 2024 Dan North & Associates Limited, registered in England and Wales\n06716833.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
