Here's How to Thrive In It Just\nfollow the R.E.O.R.G method. It stands for React, Evaluate, Overinvest,\nResist, and Grow.\n\nBy Jenny Wood \u2022 Jan 10, 2022\n\nShare\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou might love your job and your teammates. But don't get too comfortable. A\ncorporate reorganization could be right around the corner.\n\nIn my 1,500-person organization within Google, I've been through two large-\nscale reorgs in three years. Shakeups can be even more frequent for smaller\ncompanies or startups, and according to a Harvard Business Review study, 80%\nof employers see restructurings continuing at an equal or faster pace in the\nnext three years.\n\nThis means that reorgs are a given. The only question is how you respond to\nthem \u2014 and how you can leverage them for your career advancement. Here's a\nguide to not just surviving your company's reorg but to thriving as a result\nof it. I call it R.E.O.R.G, which stands for, React, Evaluate, Overinvest,\nResist, and Grow.\n\n## React\n\nReact consciously \u2014 instead of automatically \u2014 to the reorg. Knee-jerk\nreactions of fear and frustration are normal, but managers notice how folks\nshow up in the days and months after a reorg announcement. You want to show\nthat you can thrive during uncertainty.\n\nConscious reaction doesn't mean faking that you are over-the-moon excited\nabout the changes. You might go through a real sense of loss and mourning \u2014\nthe loss of a great boss, the dismantling of a team you loved, and so on.\nThat's natural. But while it's helpful to work through these emotions\nprivately (and in the right way with your team or manager if you have that\npsychological safety), you should avoid complaining, naysaying, or bringing\ndown the team morale.\n\nIn public, you should be a net-positive energy contributor. When you assume\nbest intentions (i.e. there are probably some smart people at the top making\nthese changes for valid business reasons), it makes reacting intentionally\neasier even as you process your own emotions.\n\n## Evaluate\n\nEvaluate where you are in your career and what you want to do next. A reorg\ncan be a useful inflection point even if you didn't realize you were ready for\none. You might ask yourself if you are comfortable where you are career-wise\nor if this is a great opportunity for a new role. Restructures almost always\ncreate new opportunities, and they can be a good forcing function to move on\nto your next adventure.\n\nThat new opportunity might be within the same team, a different org, or a\ndifferent company entirely. During one reorg, I decided I was going to ride\nout the changes and stay put. During another, I knew right away that I wanted\nto apply for one of the new positions the reorg created. Neither decision was\nright or wrong; they both suited my needs and my career trajectory at the\ntime. When you evaluate where you are, you can take the next step that makes\nthe most sense for your professional advancement.\n\n## Overinvest\n\nOverinvest in leading through the change. Whether you are an individual\ncontributor or a manager (who might be dealing with your own sense of loss and\nuncertainty), you can shine in the aftermath of a reorg by leaning into the\nwork that needs to be done. This might mean joining the workstream on change\nmanagement or stepping up to lead the new customer segmentation strategy upon\nwhich the whole reorg was predicated.\n\nFor example, when I was reorged into a new team, I wasn't feeling great about\nwhere I landed. I was the only employee based in New York City who would now\nwork remotely on an all-Chicago team. Huh. I didn't see that one coming; I was\nas perplexed as I was demotivated. However, I knew demotivation wouldn't serve\nme or my career aspirations to get promoted in the next six months.\n\nDespite my instinct to pull back on effort, I chose to overinvest. As it\nturned out, I was the only one on the team of seven who had a specific product\nexpertise. I immediately offered weekly product trainings to my new peers.\nRight away, it gave me a sense of responsibility and ownership, and my new\nboss noticed my proactivity. To her, it indicated that I was \"on the bus\" and\nable to thrive during change. Your manager's perception that you are\noverinvesting at a time when the company needs your leadership is always good\nfor your career.\n\n## Resist\n\nResist gossip, or, more specifically, the negative sentiment it can cause.\nReorgs often bring up emotions and may tempt you to speculate or seek\ninformation. It's of course helpful to know what's going on, and that doesn't\nalways happen through official channels. Frankly, speculative water-cooler\nchat can be fun and build culture between colleagues. However, when gossip is\nmeanspirited, it can decrease your effectiveness in navigating a reorg, and it\ncan harm your reputation to boot. Avoid it if you can.\n\nRather than saying to your peer, \"I heard they combined the two orgs because\nthey want to get rid of Brian,\" ask your manager or manager's manager, in an\nappropriate way, what the business reasons were for the reorg. Hopefully\nthey've already shared the guiding principles, but if you're eager to know one\nlevel deeper, have an honest conversation with your boss. If you're a manager\nyourself, this also gives you clear information to share with your team.\nSpreading rumors leads to burned bridges, and that's a fast way to thwart your\ncareer.\n\n## Grow\n\nPersonal and professional growth is a near guaranteed outcome of any corporate\nrestructure. You might get the short end of the stick and get demoted, layered\nunder an extra level of management, or even laid off. Alternatively, you might\nget the long end of the stick and find yourself promoted, managing a team of\n200 up from 50, or being tapped to lead the key focus area for that year's\nannual plan.\n\nIf the former happens, you may seek out a job change; growth inevitably comes\nfrom that transition. If the latter happens, you'll have more responsibility\nor learn new skills; growth inevitably comes with that too! If you have a\ngrowth mindset, reorgs can be a boon to your career, because however you land\nin the reorg, something has changed, and change breeds growth.\n\nWith R.E.O.R.G., you now have a framework to help you navigate the challenging\ntime that can come directly after a company or team restructure. When you're\ndealing with the uncertainty and discomfort that reorgs can bring, consider\nhow you might react, evaluate, overinvest, resist, and grow. This guidance\nwill help you not just survive the reorg, but thrive in your career as a\nresult.\n\nJenny Wood\n\nFounder, Google's Own Your Career program\n\nJenny Wood is the founder of Google's Own Your Career program.
