Cement\u2019s basic molecular structure finally decoded\n\n# Cement\u2019s basic molecular structure finally decoded\n\nRobustness comes from messiness, not a clean geometric arrangement\n\nDenise Brehm, Civil and Environmental Engineering\n\nPublication Date:\n\nSeptember 9, 2009\n\nIn the 2,000 or so years since the Roman Empire employed a naturally occurring\nform of cement to build a vast system of concrete aqueducts and other large\nedifices, researchers have analyzed the molecular structure of natural\nmaterials and created entirely new building materials such as steel, which has\na well-documented crystalline structure at the atomic scale.\n\nOddly enough, the three-dimensional crystalline structure of cement hydrate \u2014\nthe paste that forms and quickly hardens when cement powder is mixed with\nwater \u2014 has eluded scientific attempts at decoding, despite the fact that\nconcrete is the most prevalent man-made material on earth and the focus of a\nmultibillion-dollar industry that is under pressure to clean up its act. The\nmanufacture of cement is responsible for about 5 percent of all carbon dioxide\nemissions worldwide, and new emission standards proposed by the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency could push the cement industry to the\ndeveloping world.\n\n\u201cCement is so widely used as a building material that nobody is going to\nreplace it anytime soon. But it has a carbon dioxide problem, so a basic\nunderstanding of this material could be very timely,\u201d said MIT Professor\nSidney Yip, co-author of a paper published online in the Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences (PNAS) during the week of Sept. 7 that announces\nthe decoding of the three-dimensional structure of the basic unit of cement\nhydrate by a group of MIT researchers who have adopted the team name of Liquid\nStone.\n\n\u201cWe believe this work is a first step toward a consistent model of the\nmolecular structure of cement hydrate, and we hope the scientific community\nwill work with it,\u201d said Yip, who is in MIT\u2019s Department of Nuclear Science\nand Engineering (NSE). \u201cIn every field there are breakthroughs that help the\nresearch frontier moving forward. One example is Watson and Crick\u2019s discovery\nof the basic structure of DNA. That structural model put biology on very sound\nfooting.\u201d\n\nScientists have long believed that at the atomic level, cement hydrate (or\ncalcium-silica-hydrate) closely resembles the rare mineral tobermorite, which\nhas an ordered geometry consisting of layers of infinitely long chains of\nthree-armed silica molecules (called silica tetrahedra) interspersed with neat\nlayers of calcium oxide.\n\nBut the MIT team found that the calcium-silica-hydrate in cement isn\u2019t really\na crystal. It\u2019s a hybrid that shares some characteristics with crystalline\nstructures and some with the amorphous structure of frozen liquids, such as\nglass or ice.\n\nAt the atomic scale, tobermorite and other minerals resemble the regular,\nlayered geometric patterns of kilim rugs, with horizontal layers of triangles\ninterspersed with layers of colored stripes. But a two-dimensional look at a\nunit of cement hydrate would show layers of triangles (the silica tetrahedra)\nwith every second, fifth or eighth triangle turned up or down along the\nhorizontal axis, reaching into the layer of calcium oxide above or below.\n\nAnd it is in these messy areas \u2014 where breaks in the silica tetrahedra create\nsmall voids in the corresponding layers of calcium oxide \u2014 that water\nmolecules attach, giving cement its robust quality. Those erstwhile \u201cflaws\u201d in\nthe otherwise regular geometric structure provide some give to the building\nmaterial at the atomic scale that transfers up to the macro scale. When under\nstress, the cement hydrate has the flexibility to stretch or compress just a\nlittle, rather than snapping.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for several years that at the nano scale, cement hydrates pack\ntogether tightly like oranges in a grocer\u2019s pyramid. Now, we\u2019ve finally been\nable to look inside the orange to find its fundamental signature. I call it\nthe DNA of concrete,\u201d said Franz-Josef Ulm, the Macomber Professor in the\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), a co-author of the\npaper. \u201cWhereas water weakens a material like tobermorite or jennite, it\nstrengthens the cement hydrate. The \u2018disorder\u2019 or complexity of its chemistry\ncreates a heterogenic, robust structure.\n\n\u201cNow that we have a validated molecular model, we can manipulate the chemical\nstructure to design concrete for strength and environmental qualities, such as\nthe ability to withstand higher pressure or temperature,\u201d said Ulm.\n\nCEE Visiting Professor Roland Pellenq, director of research at the\nInterdisciplinary Center of Nanosciences at Marseille, which is part of the\nFrench National Center of Scientific Research and Marseille University, pinned\ndown the exact chemical shape and structure of C-S-H using atomistic modeling\non 260 co-processors and a statistical method called the grand canonical Monte\nCarlo simulation.\n\nLike its name, the simulation requires a bit of gambling to find the answer.\nPellenq first removed all water molecules from the basic unit of tobermorite,\nwatched the geometry collapse, then returned the water molecules singly, then\ndoubly and so on, removing them each time to allow the geometry to reshape as\nit would naturally. After he added the 104th water molecule, the correct\natomic weight of C-S-H was reached, and Pellenq knew he had an accurate model\nfor the geometric structure of the basic unit of cement hydrate.\n\nThe team then used that atomistic model to perform six tests that validated\nits accuracy.\n\n\u201cThis gives us a starting point for experiments to improve the mechanical\nproperties and durability of concrete. For instance, we can now start\nreplacing silica in our model with other materials,\u201d said Pellenq.\n\nOther team members are graduate student Rouzbeh Shahsavari of CEE and Markus\nBuehler, MIT\u2019s Esther and Harold E.
