In a blog last week, Hock Tan, CEO and Chairman of\nBroadcom sought to reassure customers, partners and investors over the brutal\nlicensing changes imposed on the market. By seeking to frame this move as pro-\ncompetition and pro-innovation through the adoption of a subscription\nlicensing approach, Broadcom tries to obfuscate the main issues in this\ndispute.\n\nThe subscription license model has never been the problem; indeed, CISPE\nmembers and their customers are already using it. What threatens the economic\nviability of many cloud services used by customers in Europe, are the massive\nand unjustifiable hikes in prices, the re-bundling of products, altered basis\nof billing and the imposition of unfair software licensing terms that restrict\nchoice and lock-in customers and partners.\n\nAnti-cloud licensing\n\nSubscription licensing should allow flexible pay-as-you-go models that help\ncustomers and providers scale resources to demand. Broadcom\u2019s new terms are\nthe opposite and are in essence anti-cloud, forcing partners to commit and pay\nin advance for virtualisation capacity that they may never need. Instead of\npaying-as-you go for actual consumption (based on memory used), as is common\nfor cloud infrastructure and for VMware previously, the new terms insist on\nup-front commitment to 3 years-worth of capacity based on server cores that\ncould be used. This is like being forced to pay, in advance, for a fleet of\ntaxis that you may, or may not, use in the next 3 years! The unfair software\nlicensing practices of dominant software companies are undermining the\nfundamental value of the cloud; the ability to deliver services that an\nenterprise needs when and where they need them.\n\nAdding Insult to Injury\n\nThe offer to continue zero-day patch support for existing perpetual license\ncustomers is insulting in its limitations. Effectively promising no more than\nto fix critical software flaws that emerge in the product unless the customer\ndecides to move to the new subscription license verges on racketeering.\n\nLecturing customers\n\nFinally, by lecturing customers on what they need, and insisting against real-\nworld evidence to the contrary that new prices are lower, Broadcom further\nillustrates its ability and inclination to act independently and against the\ninterests of customers and partners. New bundles, the move from memory to\ncore-based pricing and the removal of some popular products all mean that the\nuniversal experience across CISPE members and the wider coalition of\ncustomers, is that prices are not lower, but have, in fact jumped by factors\nof 6, 10 or even 12 times.\n\nCritical Impact of Regulators\n\nBroadcom has trumpeted some very minor concessions as evidence that it is\nlistening to the concerns of the market. However, it seems to us that this\nalbeit unsatisfactory attempt to deflect anger, was prompted by the European\nCommission\u2019s Request for Information (RFI) sent to Broadcom last week. None of\nour members, nor the wider coalition of customers we are working with has\nreported any direct engagement or offer to discuss or negotiate these terms\nfrom Broadcom.\n\nFormal Investigations Required\n\nCISPE welcomes the involvement of the European Commission and thanks it for\nthis important interaction. We know that we can rely on the support of\norganisations representing European professional users, including Cigref, with\nwhom we are working to find solutions and alternatives to the challenges faced\nby all historical VMware customers at Broadcom.\n\nDominant software firms increasingly feel unconstrained in their use of unfair\nsoftware licensing practices to distort markets in their favour. We have seen\nit with Microsoft and now Broadcom. The ability for dominant software\nproviders to unilaterally \u2018pick winners\u2019 by deciding who can and who cannot\nlicence their software is a clear form of discrimination. We urge the European\nCommission and other powerful regulators to act now to halt this tide of abuse\nthat is damaging Europe\u2019s shift to the cloud and digital growth. Formal\ninvestigations are needed now.\n\nFrancisco Mingorance, secretary general, CISPE\n\n> \u201cIt is clear to us that this blog from Broadcom was in response to the\n> timely and precise intervention of the European Commission, and we thank\n> them for their action. However, the response from Broadcom is insulting,\n> unsatisfactory and has only increased the anger among our members. What is\n> needed is concerted action by regulators to enforce, through formal\n> investigations, a return to fair licensing principles across the software\n> market.\u201d\n\nHenri d\u2019Agrain, General manager of CIGREF\n\n> \u201cWe are tired of Broadcom dictating what we need and what is good for us. We\n> are fed up with claims of lower prices while witnessing an unprecedented\n> increase in licensing costs for VMware\u2019s core software, with no functional\n> justification. We are weary of Broadcom\u2019s disdain and harsh treatment\n> towards our members. We urge the Commission to take action, to act swiftly,\n> with a political vision, and not to leave this matter solely to the\n> discretion of competition law technicians, as it falls outside their\n> purview.\u201d\n\nAlexander Windbichler, CEO Anexia\n\n> \u201cFor us it\u2019s like being told the pacemaker we rely upon to stay alive is\n> suddenly going to cost multiple-times more to run. Yes, we can change it,\n> but that requires finding an alternative, plus scheduling an operation and\n> accounting for the rest and physiotherapy to recuperate. All of this takes\n> time and resources which we are not being offered. We demand a pause to\n> consider our options and viable alternatives that will allow our business to\n> prosper.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved by CISPE\n\nCISPE uses cookies to give you the best browsing experience.
