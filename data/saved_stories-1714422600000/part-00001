Gitlin - 4/29/2024, 1:48 PM\n\nEnlarge / BlueCruise allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel but not\ntheir eyes off the road.\n\nFord\n\n#### reader comments\n\n107\n\nThe federal regulator responsible for road safety has opened yet another probe\ninto the safety of a hands-free driver assistance system, we learned this\nmorning. And no, it's not a system from Tesla. The National Highway Traffic\nSafety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation has opened a\npreliminary investigation into Ford's BlueCruise system, following a pair of\nfatal crashes, both of which occurred at night.\n\nFord first introduced BlueCruise in 2021. Like the similar General Motors\nSuper Cruise, but unlike Tesla Autopilot, BlueCruise has been designed with a\ntightly controlled operational design domain (ODD) that only allows it to be\nengaged on restricted access, divided lane highways that have been lidar-\nmapped in advance.\n\nAdditionally, like Super Cruise but unlike Tesla's far more dangerous system,\nthere is an infrared gaze-tracking driver monitoring camera that will\ndisengage the system if it determines the driver is not actually paying\nattention to the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo unlike Autopilot, drivers using BlueCruise can take their hands off the\nwheel, but they are still expected to keep paying attention to the road ahead,\nready to take control at a moment's notice if necessary.\n\n(That makes these so-called Level 2 assists; Mercedes-Benz has a more advanced\nLevel 3 assist that can allow drivers to stop paying attention, but it will\nonly operate in congested traffic jams and up to 40 mph, and then only in\nCalifornia or Nevada.)\n\nDespite the safeguards of a tightly geofenced, driver-monitored ODD,\nBlueCruise is not foolproof. In March, the National Transportation Safety\nBoard\u2014which investigates crashes but, unlike NHTSA, has no regulatory\nauthority to compel an automaker to do anything\u2014opened an investigation into a\nfatal crash involving a Ford Mustang Mach-E in San Antonio, Texas, on February\n24.\n\nNow, NHTSA says it is aware of a second fatal BlueCruise crash, which, like\nthe San Antonio incident, also happened at night. It has opened a preliminary\ninvestigation to determine if the system is defective.\n\nArs contacted Ford, which told us that \"we are working with NHTSA to support\nits investigation.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n107\n\nJonathan M.

You can take your\n> hands off the steering wheel but must continue looking forward ready to\n> resume control at a moment's notice or the system turns off? What exactly\n> are you going to do with your hands other than put them on the wheel?\n\nIt's definitely not really intuitive, but (from experience*) it's a lot of\nlittle things that make the trip more pleasant.\n\nYou can hand stuff to the kid in the back seat while you're driving (assuming\nyou're flexible enough to do this while still watching the road and the\nlimiting factor before was keeping your hands on the wheel) instead of needing\na full stop. You can adjust the seat ergonomics so that they're more\ncomfortable without needing as much consideration too being able to hold\ncontrols for long periods You can actually pay more attention to the road and\nhave better situational awareness, because you no longer have to focus\n(appreciably) on keeping the car between the lines and can give all your focus\nto other drivers It reduces the low level mental energy drain from driving, so\nyou feel better when you get to your destination and also remain more alert\nfor the drive\n\nThe energy and alertness thing was the biggest thing we noticed - we were\nshocked at how big of a difference it makes. It's the difference between\nneeding a full recovery day when driving to/from the in laws vs just being a\nbit tired.\n\n*Speaking as a comma.ai owner that has to take 900ish mile road trips (one way) to the in-laws\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 2:52 pm\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\nToday on War Stories, Ars Technica is joined by Dan Greenawalt, Creative\nDirector of the Forza franchise, who takes us through the colossal potential\n(and many challenges) of utilizing deep neural networks to build sophisticated\nracing AI. Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
