Here\u2019s how.\n\n## ZTDNS brings the best of both worlds to DNS: encryption and fine-grained\ncontrol.\n\nDan Goodin - 5/3/2024, 11:42 PM\n\nEnlarge\n\nGetty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n134\n\nTranslating human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses has long\nbeen fraught with gaping security risks. After all, lookups are rarely end-to-\nend encrypted. The servers providing domain name lookups provide translations\nfor virtually any IP address\u2014even when they\u2019re known to be malicious. And many\nend-user devices can easily be configured to stop using authorized lookup\nservers and instead use malicious ones.\n\nMicrosoft on Friday provided a peek at a comprehensive framework that aims to\nsort out the Domain Name System (DNS) mess so that it\u2019s better locked down\ninside Windows networks. It\u2019s called ZTDNS (zero trust DNS). Its two main\nfeatures are (1) encrypted and cryptographically authenticated connections\nbetween end-user clients and DNS servers and (2) the ability for\nadministrators to tightly restrict the domains these servers will resolve.\n\n## Clearing the minefield\n\nOne of the reasons DNS has been such a security minefield is that these two\nfeatures can be mutually exclusive. Adding cryptographic authentication and\nencryption to DNS often obscures the visibility admins need to prevent user\ndevices from connecting to malicious domains or detect anomalous behavior\ninside a network. As a result, DNS traffic is either sent in clear text or\nit's encrypted in a way that allows admins to decrypt it in transit through\nwhat is essentially an adversary-in-the-middle attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmins are left to choose between equally unappealing options: (1) route DNS\ntraffic in clear text with no means for the server and client device to\nauthenticate each other so malicious domains can be blocked and network\nmonitoring is possible, or (2) encrypt and authenticate DNS traffic and do\naway with the domain control and network visibility.\n\nZTDNS aims to solve this decades-old problem by integrating the Windows DNS\nengine with the Windows Filtering Platform\u2014the core component of the Windows\nFirewall\u2014directly into client devices.\n\nJake Williams, VP of research and development at consultancy Hunter\nStrategies, said the union of these previously disparate engines would allow\nupdates to be made to the Windows firewall on a per-domain name basis. The\nresult, he said, is a mechanism that allows organizations to, in essence, tell\nclients \u201conly use our DNS server, that uses TLS, and will only resolve certain\ndomains.\u201d Microsoft calls this DNS server or servers the \u201cprotective DNS\nserver.\u201d\n\nBy default, the firewall will deny resolutions to all domains except those\nenumerated in allow lists. A separate allow list will contain IP address\nsubnets that clients need to run authorized software. Key to making this work\nat scale inside an organization with rapidly changing needs. Networking\nsecurity expert Royce Williams (no relation to Jake Williams) called this a\n\u201csort of a bidirectional API for the firewall layer, so you can both trigger\nfirewall actions (by input *to* the firewall), and trigger external actions\nbased on firewall state (output *from* the firewall). So instead of having to\nreinvent the firewall wheel if you are an AV vendor or whatever, you just hook\ninto WFP.\u201d\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n134\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
