A\n> single memory space offers several advantages: i) it eliminates the need for\n> data replication and costly data transfers, ii) it substantially simplifies\n> application development and allows an incremental acceleration of\n> applications, iii) is easy to maintain, and iv) its potential can be well\n> realized via the abstractions in the OpenMP 5.2 standard, where the host and\n> the device data environments can be unified in a more performant way. In\n> this article, we provide a blueprint of the APU programming model leveraging\n> unified memory and highlight key distinctions compared to the conventional\n> approach with discrete GPUs. OpenFOAM, an open-source C++ library for\n> computational fluid dynamics, is presented as a case study to emphasize the\n> flexibility and ease of offloading a full-scale production-ready application\n> on MI300 APUs using directive-based OpenMP programming.\n\nComments:| Accepted paper at ISC High Performance 2024  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2405.00436 [cs.DC]  \n(or arXiv:2405.00436v1 [cs.DC] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.00436arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Suyash Tandon [view email] [v1] Wed, 1 May 2024 10:38:06 UTC (955 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Porting HPC Applications to AMD\nInstinct$^\\text{TM}$ MI300A Using Unified Memory and OpenMP, by Suyash Tandon\nand 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.DC\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2405\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
