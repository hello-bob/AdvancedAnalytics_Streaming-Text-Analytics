The report notes\nthat population is driven by births, deaths and net migration (net migration\nis immigration less emigration). This flux in growth has led to the Falklands\npopulation being double the size it was in 1980. The 110 births and 111 deaths\nbetween 2017 and 2021 has accounted for a very slight decrease in population,\nbut is a continuing downward trend when compared to previous census periods.\nNet migration was also lower than previous census periods, by 20 per cent.\nThis, according to the report, reflects the unusually low natural population\nincrease between 2017 and 2021. However, this could be as a result of the\npandemic and country-specific immigration policy changes. The \u2018usually\nresident\u2019 population increased by an estimated 264 people over the census\nperiod, reaching a total of 3662 people in October 2021. The average age being\n40.1 years old. Falklands born In 2021, there are 1530 residents who were born\nin the islands and 1898 who are classed as \u2018foreign born\u2019 in the census\nreport. Of those, 749 (21.8%) were born in the UK, 369 (11%) in St Helena, 178\n(approx. 5%) in Philippines, 168 in Chile, and 434 from other countries. 234\nrecorded \u2018not known\u2019 in this section. 130 individuals were born outside the\nFalkland Islands for medical reasons and returned to the Islands within 6\nmonths of birth. For the purposes of the census, these individuals are\nconsidered Falkland Islands-born. Overall, Falkland Islanders (including those\nwith status) comprise 61% of the population, followed by Work Permit holders\nat 23% and Permanent Residence Permit holders at 10%. Mortgage/rent For\nmortgage or rent outgoings, just under half of all households (49%) reported\ntheir accommodation costs ranged from \u00a3401 to \u00a3700 per month. Overall this is\nan increase since the last census period. The report has calculated the\naverage rent as \u00a3602 per month; it was \u00a3534 in 2016. Work There was a 10%\nincrease in the number of people in work compared to 2016. The unemployment\nrate is still very low in the Falklands, less than 1%, and effectively\ncreating full employment. The Falkland Islands Government remains the largest\nemployer on the islands with 663 employees, which has increased by 138 since\n2016. Second largest employment sector was construction (217), followed by\nAgriculture (204). 15% of those working were self-employed, a similar figure\nto that of the previous census. Income The average reported income was\napproximately \u00a329,900, a 13% increase from 2016. The proportion of people who\nearned \u00a315,000 or less per annum has decreased to 21% (25% in 2016), and only\n17% of those employed earned more than \u00a340,000. One in six people reported\nthat they had more than one job. The difference between Stanley and Camp\nincome is still closing with an average income of \u00a330,400 in Stanley compared\nto \u00a325,700 in Camp, although obviously the types of employment available in\nCamp are not the same as in Stanley. The gender pay gap is beginning to close,\nmales earning an average of \u00a332,300 per annum compared to \u00a327,000 for females.\nHealth This is the second census to ask for people to rate their own health.\n85% of the population rated their health as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018very good\u2019. The\nstatistics on this particular part of the census is interesting because it\nreports that \u201cMPC residents were overwhelmingly more likely to report their\nhealth as being \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018very good\u2019 compared to other locations.\u201d It is\nunclear as to why that might be as a number of factors could be at work to\ncontribute to this particular figure. The 2021 also included a question about\nlife satisfaction for the first time and, according to the report, provides a\nuseful snapshot of the life experiences of Falkland Islands residents. 99% of\nthose questioned responded and rated their life satisfaction as 8 on a scale\nof 1 to 10. It was slightly higher at MPC (8.4). Alcohol Alcohol consumption\nin many countries continues to decline despite spikes recorded as a result of\nthe pandemic. Here in the Falklands 69% of those over 16 reported to have\nconsumed alcohol in the last 12 months, an increase of 3%. The largest\nincreases were found in people aged 16 to 24 and also those aged 35 to 44\nyears old. Late report \u2013 reasons Asked why the report has taken so long to\nrelease FIG Head of Policy explained that The FIG Statistician is responsible\nfor carrying out the census and producing the reports once they have analysed\nthe data \u201cHowever, the Policy Department has struggled to recruit into its key\nanalytical roles since the time of the last census \u2013 the Statistician post has\nessentially remained vacant since December 2021, and we were without an\nEconomist for a year from February 2022.\u201d She said as a result, \u201cthe resources\navailable to us were extremely stretched \u2013 we published the key findings and a\nsummary of the 2021 census results in October 2022 along with a core data set,\n\n###### Economy\n\n  * Fishing\n  * Oil\n  * Tourism\n\n###### Lifestyle\n\n  * Sports\n\n###### More\n\n  * Rural\n  * Community\n  * Politics\n  * Opinion Piece\n\n###### Profile\n\n  * My Account\n  * Privacy & Refund Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n\n## Penguin News.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2022.
