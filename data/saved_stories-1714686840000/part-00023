But a federal office found he\nmanipulated his data.\n\n(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) University of Utah research park is pictured on Thursday, Oct. 27, 2022. A neuroscience researcher at the school was fund to have manipulated data in his studies of the brain, according to federal investigators.\n\nBy Courtney Tanner\n\n| April 26, 2024, 3:01 p.m.\n\nA former University of Utah neuroscientist \u2014 who was regarded in the field as\na \u201cvisionary\u201d \u2014 manipulated results and faked data in his research for years,\naccording to the findings of a federal investigation.\n\nThe report on the misconduct from the U.S. Office of Research Integrity states\nthat Gian-Stefano Brigidi used at least 43 fabricated numbers across several\nscientific presentations, a handful of grant applications and one published\npaper in the peer-reviewed journal \u201cCell.\u201d Using that faked data, he was\nawarded more than $1 million in federal funding.\n\nThe U. stated this week that Brigidi no longer works at the school, but\ndeclined to comment further on his employment or the findings from\ninvestigators. Brigidi, who was widely considered a creative thinker in the\nstudy of the brain, was first hired as an assistant professor at the school in\nJanuary 2021. His tenure there ended in August 2023, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nPrior to working at the U., Brigidi was a postdoctoral fellow in a lab at the\nUniversity of California San Diego, as well as an assistant professor there.\n\nBrigidi told The Transmitter \u2014 a publication that writes about neuroscience\nresearch and first reported on the faked data \u2014 that no misconduct happened\nduring his time at the U., though the federal report shows that he continued\nto use the numbers in Utah that he had originally manipulated while in\nCalifornia. He did not respond to requests for comment from The Salt Lake\nTribune.\n\nBoth the U. and UC San Diego did their own analyses of his work, which also\nconfirmed the research misconduct that has called into question years of\nBrigidi\u2019s work. And it provides a glimpse into the oversight of research and\nthe rigorous process for when allegations arise that research is not based on\nreal results.\n\n\u201cAllegations of misconduct can come through many channels, and as soon as we\nare aware of an allegation, UC San Diego\u2019s Office of Research Compliance and\nIntegrity begins our inquiry,\u201d a spokesperson for the California school said\nin an email to The Tribune.\n\nThe faculty leader of the Bloodgood Lab at UC San Diego, Brenda Bloodgood, did\nnot respond to a request for comment. Her lab is renowned for its studies of\nhow experiences shape the neurons of the brain \u2014 work that Brigidi was\ncontinuing in his position at the U. and for which he was also awarded\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in funding.\n\nCurrently, his picture remains with the noted alumni on the Bloodgood Lab\u2019s\nwebsite. His staff page has been removed from the U.\u2019s site.\n\nBrigidi specifically was heralded by the National Institutes of Health in\n2021, a few months after joining the U.\u2019s faculty, for his \u201chighly innovative\u201d\nproject on how the electrical circuitry of the human brain is altered by\nmemories or behaviors \u2014 such as having a kid or earning a promotion.\n\nThe idea was that significant experiences leave a mark on a molecular level,\naccording to the announcement of the award.\n\nThe U. has since requested the National Institutes of Health to terminate that\n$1.37 million grant.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what happens to other funding awarded to Brigidi through the U.S.\nPublic Health Service.\n\nThe research office\u2019s report states that Brigidi \u201cknowingly or intentionally\nmanipulated\u201d graphs, figures and images in presentations and posters over\nseven years, from 2015 to 2022.\n\n### Subscribe To Top Stories Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news by subscribing to our Top Stories newsletter.

If he submits any applications for federal funding, the\ninstitution employing him must include a certification that the research is\n\u201cbased on actual experiments.\u201d\n\nBrigidi must also correct or retract the paper he published in \u201cCell\u201d in 2019.\n\nThis is the second time in the last two years that a faculty member at the\nUniversity of Utah has been cited by the federal Office of Research Integrity\nfor misconduct. Last year, Ivana Frech, a former assistant professor in the\nU.\u2019s School of Medicine, was also found to have manipulated data by altering\nimages in her work about cellular iron regulation.\n\n\u201cORI found that these acts constitute a significant departure from accepted\npractices of the relevant research community,\u201d the office wrote in that\nreport.\n\nFrech is no longer employed by the U., with her last day there in October\n2013. It\u2019s unclear why the investigation into image manipulation came a decade\nafter that. But she will be required to retract or correct her findings that\nwere also published in \u201cCell.\u201d Frech did not respond to a request for comment\nfrom The Tribune.\n\nJulie Kiefer, a U. spokesperson, said the school \u201ctakes research misconduct\nseriously.\u201d When manipulation in research occurs, she said, the university\nwill work to correct the record, notify federal funding agencies and provide\ntraining on responsible research practices.\n\nShe said that the U. is committed to \u201cethical conduct and excellence in\nscientific inquiry.\u201d\n\nctanner@sltrib.comFollow @CourtneyLTanner\n\nDonate to the newsroom now.
