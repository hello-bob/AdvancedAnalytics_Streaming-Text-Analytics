It had help from Elena and Nikolai \u0160apo\u0161nikov, a family\nof deep-cover spies working as arms dealers.\n\n###### Content\n\nRU\n\nCarried out with The Insider's Greek investigative partner Inside Story.\n\nVilla Elena, a three-storey hotel in Frama, Halkidiki, northern Greece, boasts\na large outdoor swimming pool, gazebo, private garden, not to mention\nsprawling grounds. Even if the interior \u2013 all loud greens and purples with\ngold-rimmed cabinets \u2013 looks hopelessly post-Soviet, the amenities include\nfoam pillows, hairdryers and bathrobes. One could do worse for $155 a night.\nBut Nikolay and Elena \u0160apo\u0161nikov, for whom the pillared pile on the Aegean is\nnamed, are no ordinary hoteliers. They are Russian \u201cillegals,\u201d or spies\noperating outside of diplomatic cover, who spent decades living under false\npretenses as naturalized citizens of Czechia.\n\nAnd Villa Elena is no ordinary hotel.\n\nFor the last fifteen years, it has served as the Greek safehouse for members\nof GRU Unit 29155, Vladimir Putin\u2019s most grimly accomplished assassination and\nsabotage squad, the one responsible for poisoning enemies of the Kremlin and\nblowing up materiel stored in Czechia and Bulgaria, both NATO countries,\nbefore it could be sent to the Georgian and Ukrainian armies as well as\nWestern-backed Syrian rebels. All of these end users were variously squaring\noff against Russian forces or threatening to overthrow an important Russian\nclient. In fact, the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs abetted those bombings, which The Insider\nfirst exposed as the work of Unit 29155.\n\nToday, the Czech Intelligence Center for Counter-Terrorism and Organized Crime\nhas released the findings of a years-long investigation into Unit 29155\u2019s role\nin destroying two Czech government-run weapons and ammunition depots in 2014\nin Vrb\u011btice, a small town in the south Moravian region of Czechia. These\nattacks, which resulted in Prague\u2019s expulsion of 18 Russian intelligence\nofficers operating in the country under diplomatic cover, were conducted with\nexplosive devices emplaced by Unit 29155\u2019s most recognizable operatives:\nAlexander Mishkin, 44, and Anatoly Chepiga, 45. Both would gain international\nnotoriety for trying to murder Sergei Skripal, a GRU officer turned British\ndouble agent, along with his daughter Yulia, in Salisbury, England in 2018,\nwith the military-grade nerve agent Novichok.\n\nThe \u0160apo\u0161nikovs not only arranged for Mishkin and Chepiga to gain access to\ntwo different warehouses in Vrb\u011btice, but they also communicated directly with\nGen. Andrei Averyanov, 58, the founding commander of Unit 29155, who tasked\nthem with facilitating violence against their adoptive nation.\n\nThe GRU, like the SVR, Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, has long\nmaintained its own illegals program. But the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs are the first known\ncase of to ever be affiliated with Unit 29155, whose remit is strictly\nkinetic. In March, The Insider, along with its investigative partners 60\nMinutes and Der Spiegel, uncovered evidence implicating Unit 29155 in directed\nenergy attacks thought to be the cause of Havana Syndrome, the name given to a\ncollection of debilitating medical ailments afflicting American intelligence\nofficers and diplomats worldwide.\n\nWhile both \u0160apo\u0161nikov spouses engaged in espionage for Russia assisted GRU\u2019s\nsabotage operations, the wife, \u0160apo\u0161nikova, 62, appears to have been directly\nintegrated with Unit 29155, as evidenced both by findings by the Czech\ninvestigators and by The Insider\u2019s independent discovery of documentary\nevidence. As such, Czech investigators have concluded, she likely directed and\nsupervised her husband\u2019s \u2013 and possibly their son\u2019s \u2013 activities in support of\nRussian state interests. The family\u2019s clandestine duties ranged from\nintelligence-gathering to logistical facilitation, providing safe havens,\nrecruitment efforts, and even aiding in securing physical access for GRU\noperatives conducting sabotage missions.\n\nThe Insider has also discovered that \u0160apo\u0161nikova even possessed a secret\nRussian service passport from a special series reserved for spies from Unit\n29155. She even received the Hero of Russian Federation, the highest state\nhonor awarded to those who perform \u201cservice to the Russian state and nation,\nusually connected with a heroic feat of valor.\u201d Putin himself bestowed the\ntitle on \u0160apo\u0161nikova in a secret ceremony in Moscow following Unit 29155\u2019s\nsabotage operations in Czechia and Bulgaria.\n\nIn 2023, Czech authorities, after conducting an independent criminal\ninvestigation into the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs\u2019 role in the 2014 bombings in Vrb\u011btice,\ndeclared the couple \u201cpersons of interest\u201d and requested their questioning by\nGreek authorities. Nikolay and Elena \u0160apo\u0161nikov submitted a statement to Greek\nauthorities alleging they are persecuted by the Czech Republic and are\n\u201cscapegoats in the name of unknown interests.\u201d Nikolay \u0160apo\u0161nikov died from a\nheart attack in Greece in February 2024 at the age of 62.\n\n### The Illegals\n\nNikolay \u0160apo\u0161nikov was born in 1961 in Severodvinsk in the far north-west of\nRussia into a family of military engineers. In 1983 he graduated from the\nengineering department of the Baku Military Command School and was appointed\ncommander of a motorized rifle company in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital.\nRecords show that \u0160apo\u0161nikov\u2019s unit was deployed to Afghanistan from\n1983-1986, during the Soviet occupation of the country. In 1985 he divorced\nhis first wife, Natalia, and immediately married Elena \u0160apo\u0161nikov\u00e1 (n\u00e9e\nLisetskaya), a Kyiv-born engineer and the daughter of a lieutenant-colonel who\ntaught at the Kyiv military command institute. At the time of their marriage\nshe was working at the Baku-based Physics Institute. Elena had a son, Pavel,\nfrom a previous marriage. She and Nikolay bore a daughter, Valeria, who was\nborn in 1986.\n\n##### Nikolay and Elena \u0160apo\u0161nikov\u2019s Soviet passport photos\n\nThe following year, the Soviet Union began withdrawing from Afghanistan.\n\u0160apo\u0161nikov was redeployed to Czechoslovakia, then a member of the Warsaw Pact,\nthe U.S.S.R.\u2019s equivalent to NATO, where he served as motorized rifle company\ncommander in Jelsava in what is today\u2019s Slovakia. His military career ended,\nat least on paper, three years later as Czechoslovakia, along with the rest of\nthe Eastern Bloc countries, shook off the yoke of Communist rule. In February\n1989, \u0160apo\u0161nikov was expelled from the Communist Party and censured by his\ncommanders over \u201crepeated embezzlement of gasoline and batteries from the\narmy.\u201d This blot on his resume, whether real or contrived, would come in handy\na little while later.\n\nIn 1990, Nikolay was retired from military service, formally on medical\ngrounds (he suffered from a spinal injury), and assigned as a reservist to\nKyiv, Ukraine, where his wife\u2019s family then lived.\n\nBut as Soviet troops departed that country, too, less than a year later,\n\u0160apo\u0161nikov returned to Czechoslovakia, where he reported to a police precinct\nin the town of Zvolen. He sought political asylum, citing his expulsion from\nthe Soviet Communist Party as evidence of his dissidence. In August 1991,\nafter several consecutive stays in refugee camps, Nikolay received the status\nof a political refugee. A few months later, he was rejoined by his wife Elena\nand their two young children. They similarly received Czechoslovakian\npolitical asylum in 1992.\n\nAfter the Czech Republic split peacefully from Slovakia into an independent\ncountry, the family of self-professed Soviet dissidents promptly applied for\ncitizenship. However, their applications were riddled with omissions,\nmisrepresentations, and forgeries. \u0160apo\u0161nikov falsely claimed he was born to a\nfamily of clerks, not military officers. He also hid the fact that he was a\nsoldier, too, that he had served as a commander in Afghanistan, and that he\nhad a daughter from a previous marriage. Finally, he presented a forged birth\ncertificate for Pavel, Elena\u2019s son from her first marriage, making it appear\nas if Nikolay were Pavel\u2019s biological father.\n\nElena \u0160apo\u0161nikova\u2019s misrepresentations in pursuit of Czech citizenship were\nmore egregious. She lied that she had surrendered her Ukrainian passport upon\nreceiving Czechoslovakian asylum in 1992, when in fact she repeatedly used the\nUkrainian document to travel to both Russia and Ukraine \u2013 the very countries\nher purported risk of persecution entitled her to refugee status in the first\nplace.\n\nFor all that, the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs still became Czech citizens, likely through\nbribery or co-opting crooked bureaucrats. Nikolay received his passport in\n1999, while Elena, after \u201cat least six\u201d attempts, obtained hers in 2004\nfollowing the involvement of Stanislav Gross, Prague\u2019s notoriously corrupt\ninterior minister at the time. An immigration officer working on Elena\u2019s case\neven attached a hand-written note to her file: \u201cA red line running through\nthis entire application has been the various people constantly trying to\nintervene to achieve a positive outcome.\u201d\n\n### All in the Family\n\nEven after the collapse of Communism, the white and black market trade in\nSoviet-era weapons was a growth industry, owing to the fact that so many\nnations around the globe \u2013 including new-minted members of the EU and NATO \u2013\nhad armies that still relied on kit manufactured in the U.S.S.R or its\nsatellites. In the early 2000\u2019s, Nikolai pitched his military expertise to\nPetr Bernatik, a former secret agent of the \u0160tB, the Czechoslovakian state\nsecurity service. An engineer by training, Bernatik had served as an\nundercover informant in the \u0160tB\u2019s counterintelligence department, which kept\nclose ties with both the Soviet KGB and the occupying Red Army. After the\nCzech Republic became a free-market economy, Bernatik launched a number of\narms trading companies and hired his former commanding officers from the Czech\nsecret police to work for him. He apparently felt no compunction in also\nenlisting a former Russian officer.\n\nThe largest of Bernatik\u2019s arms dealing businesses was Imex Group. \u0160apo\u0161nikov\u2019s\nunofficial role in the company was that of a business development executive:\nhe scouted sales opportunities and provided consultancy and support to Imex\u2019s\ninternational customers. As time went by, \u0160apo\u0161nikov brought more and more of\nhis own family into Imex. By 2012, both Valeria and Pavel, his daughter and\nstepson, were employed by the company.\n\n##### Pavel \u0160apo\u0161nikov\u2019s application to the Czech Pirate Party forum\n\nA graduate of the University of Prague, Pavel joined Czechia\u2019s libertarian\ncenter-left Pirate Party in 2014, describing himself in an online forum as a\nformer \u201cemployee in the field of international trade\u201d with \u201ca different\nopinion from my superiors.\u201d Pavel admired the grassroots movement\u2019s doctrine\nof openness and transparency. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can be helpful at the\nmoment,\u201d he posted to the party\u2019s online forum as part of his application,\n\u201cbut maybe something will come up.\u201d Pavel\u2019s name was later added in a list of\nsuspicious new applicants who were using avatars instead of photos in their\nonline communication. Travel data shows Pavel flew to Simferopol, the\nprovincial capital of Russian-occupied Crimea, in 2019.\n\nElena, meanwhile, ran her own business: a company that purported to import pig\niron from former Soviet republics. But as Czech police would later discover,\nElena was also deeply involved with her husband\u2019s enterprise and intimately\naware of Imex\u2019s operations. In many ways, she seemed to be supervising and\ndirecting Nikolay\u2019s activities in direct coordination with Andrey Averyanov,\nthe head of Unit 29155. She communicated with Gen. Andrey Averyanov via email;\nhis Gmail address, registered from a Russian IP address, is\nvitazi31@gmail.com. (\u201cVitazi\u201d in Russian means \u201cknights.\u201d)\n\nElena also provided a veneer of plausibility for the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs\u2019 lavish\nlifestyle. Despite \u0160apo\u0161nikov\u2019s modest income from Imex (around $650 per\nmonth), the family bought real estate in Czechia and Greece at a value far in\nexcess of what their collective income could account for. As Czech\ninvestigators note, \u201cin some cases their official income could not cover even\ntheir phone bill for the month.\u201d Furthermore, Elena owned a company registered\nin the Marshall Islands and controlled two bank accounts in Switzerland. Those\noffshore accounts, plus unexplained cash infusions to their Czech banks and a\nseries of in-cash payments, appeared to have been the real source of income.\n\nThen there was their Greek villa.\n\n### The GRU\u2019s Hellenic Retreat\n\nIn 2009 the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs purchased a sprawling villa on the picturesque Aegean\npeninsula of Halkidiki, Greece. The price, as recorded in the notarial deed of\npurchase obtained by The Insider, was 275,292 euros, or $300,000 at the time.\nElena would later tell investigators that she had funded the investment \u201cwith\nmoney from my parents\u201d \u2013 a tall order for the septuagenarian couple living in\nKyiv on pensions of under $300 per month.\n\n  * The \u0160apo\u0161nikovs\u2019 villa in Frama, Halkidiki (Greece); also a Unit 29155 safehouse in Europe\n\nThe \u0160apo\u0161nikovs moved into Villa Elena in 2010 and set off to run it as a\nhotel. They only visited Czechia occasionally from then on.\n\nWhile sites such as Booking.com and Tripadvisor contain links to the property,\nwhere it appears at least a few holidaymakers stayed and even left reviews,\nThe Insider has not been able to find any publicly bookable dates since it\nstarted this investigation in 2021.\n\nUnpublicized tourists include members of Unit 29155 who began traveling to the\nnearby port city of Thessaloniki \u2013 only an hour\u2019s drive south-east from the\nvilla \u2013 as soon as the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs took ownership.\n\nAveryanov traveled to Thessaloniki under his cover identity of \u201cAndrey\nOveryanov\u201d and stayed in the vicinity of Villa Elena for a week between July\n15 and July 21, 2013, metadata from his burner phone obtained by The Insider\nshows. Averyanov returned to Thessaloniki the following year, on the return\nleg of a trip he made to Amsterdam on August 25, 2014. At least four other\nmembers of Unit 29155 took trips to Thessaloniki and likely also stayed at\nVilla Elena in the period from 2012 to 2018. Some of these visits coincided\nwith missions the operatives had in the region.\n\nFor example, Unit 29155 member Alexey Kapinos, whom \u0160apo\u0161nikov described to\nCzech investigators as \u201ca family friend,\u201d flew to Thessaloniki on a diplomatic\npassport on April 25, 2014. Just a day earlier, Kapinos\u2019 GRU associates, all\ntraveling under fake identities, arrived in Bulgaria. According to a joint\ninvestigation by The Insider and Bellingcat, which has since been corroborated\nby indictments from Bulgarian prosecutors, Unit 29155 poisoned the Bulgarian\narms dealer Emilian Gebrev with an unidentified organophosphate substance at\nthe time of this trip.\n\nEmilian Gebrev, the head of the company EMCO, told The Insider that he had\nbeen befriended by the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs in 2012. The illegals evidently sought out\nhis friendship despite the scarcity of common business projects between them.\nGebrev said he remembered that Elena was the dominant partner in the marriage,\nalways steering the conversation in her preferred direction.\n\n##### The \u0160apo\u0161nikovs \u2014 Nikolay and Elena\n\nAs previously disclosed by The Insider, at the time of his poisoning Gebrev\nwas seen as a consequential supplier of ammunition to the Ukraine Army, then\nreconstituting itself following Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea and orchestration\nof a plausibly deniable \u201cseparatist\u201d insurgency in the Donbas region of\neastern Ukraine. Gebrev says that shortly before being poisoned he stopped\nsupplying Ukraine with ammunition in voluntary compliance with the Minsk\nAccords, two serially violated ceasefire agreements signed in September 2014\nand February 2015 by Ukraine, Russia, and the Organisation for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). Two sources active in weapons procurement in\nUkraine at the time told The Insider that immediately after Gebrev\u2019s\npoisoning, \u0160apo\u0161nikov offered Ukrainian government buyers \u201ca reliable\nreplacement\u201d for the Bulgarian arms merchant. In the event, Kyiv never\npurchased from the supplier suggested by \u0160apo\u0161nikov due to the deficient\nquality of his inventory.\n\n### The Saboteurs\n\nCzech police investigators now disclose that Elena, the senior illegal in the\nhusband-and-wife team, communicated with Averyanov via his Gmail account,\noffering critical intelligence about pending weapons sale contracts involving\nImex Group. The \u0160apo\u0161nikovs\u2019 cultivation of Gebrev paid off. Their company\nbegan trading frequently with EMCO, which produced and repaired everything\nfrom Soviet-era artillery to armored vehicles across a host of plants in\nBulgaria, often for export to Georgia and Ukraine. EMCO also refurbished dated\nCzech-made ammunition, including rounds subsequently purchased by Imex Group,\ncorporate records show.\n\nAveryanov\u2019s interest in Imex Group\u2019s partners across NATO was obvious. Any\nsales deemed contrary to Russia\u2019s interest would be ideal targets for Unit\n29155, which could target the weapons and ammunition, if not try to kill the\nbrokers responsible for selling them to enemy states or non-state actors, such\nas the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a collection of Western-backed rebel groups\nopposed to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Czechs allege that Imex Group\nwas involved in deals with European counterparts that resold mines, assault\nrifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and anti-tank missiles. One Slovakian\ncompany, Kelson, sought to acquire these wares through intermediary companies,\nall with the intent to resell them to the Saudi Ministry of Defense. The FSA,\nthe Czechs conclude, were \u201cprobably\u201d the ultimate recipient. (Saudi Arabia did\nindeed purchase weapons in Croatia that wound up in FSA custody, as the New\nYork Times reported in 2013.)\n\nAs a senior GRU commander overseeing a strictly kinetic unit within the\nservice, Averyanov would have been ordered by Moscow to interdict covert\nweapons shipments intended for Syria\u2019s mainstream insurgents, who, prior to\nRussia\u2019s direct military intervention in the country\u2019s civil war in 2015, were\nperilously close to unhorsing one of Russia\u2019s most valued client regimes in\nthe Middle East. The CIA and Turkish intelligence backed dozens of FSA\nformations battling Assad\u2019s army and Iranian-backed militias until the rise of\nhardline jihadists, particularly as the Islamic State, transformed NATO\u2019s\napproach to Syria as a counterterrorist mission.\n\nOn July 24, 2013, Averyanov wrote to \u0160apo\u0161nikov\u00e1 that \u201cvery, very much we need\na complete list...\u201d of sought-after platforms. She later forwarded the GRU\ngeneral attached PDF files titled \u201cAircraft_FSA.pdf,\u201d \u201cAmmunition_FSA.pdf,\u201d\nand \u201cWeapons_FSA.pdf,\u201d all of which Pavel \u0160apo\u0161nikov sent her on August 3.\n\nThe GRU was therefore \u201cinformed about the planned trade from beginning to\nend,\u201d the Czech investigators conclude. \u201cThese goods were stored exclusively\nin Vrb\u011btice in warehouses No. 16 and 12. As a result of the subsequent\nexplosions, the goods were not delivered and were completely destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe \u0160apo\u0161nikovs \u2014 likely aided by Petr Bernatik Jr., the executive director of\nImex and the son of its founder \u2014 provided physical access to these\nwarehouses. They may have also conspired to help the GRU commit an act of\npiracy or maritime terrorism.\n\nThe first case of Unit 29155 sabotaging a military consignment may have\ninvolved disappearing a ship carrying pontoon bridge parts and Ukrainian-made\nKrAZ trucks destined for Vietnam. The \u201cINA,\u201d a Ukrainian ship, disappeared in\n2013 sometime after passing through the Suez Canal and switching off its\ntransponder. According to Czech investigators, Elena and Averyanov\n\u201ccommunicated about this order,\u201d which set sail from the Bulgarian port of\nVarna on December 17, 2013, where the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs had arrived personally to\noversee the departure. People familiar with the transaction told The Insider\nthat this shipment would have interfered with a direct sale to Vietnam by a\nRussian arms export company, and the ship\u2019s disappearance may have been aimed\nat sabotaging this competing supplier.\n\nAlmost a year later, on October 16, 2014, the first warehouse in Vrb\u011btice went\nup in flames.\n\nCzech investigators are clear that this was the handiwork of Unit 29155. On\nSeptember 26 of that year, Averyanov, using his Gmail account, messaged\n\u0160apo\u0161nikova: \u201cHello Elena, I am sending a request to visit the warehouses...\u201d\n\nThe subsequent digital exchange between the GRU handler and his Czech agent\nconsisted of pleasantries and business. \u0160apo\u0161nikova wished \u201cAndrusha,\u201d the\ndiminutive for Andrey, a happy birthday on September 29, and the two made\nplans to meet in person in Portugal the following month. Evidence shows\nAveryanov and Nikolay, along with Elena and their daughter Valeria, did in\nfact meet in Lisbon on October 3.\n\nA week later, the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs were back in Czechia, where Nikolai met with\nPetr Bernat\u00edk Jr., the son of the Imex Group\u2019s founder and \u201ca key player in\nits operations,\u201d according to investigators. Averyanov then sent a blank email\nto Bernatik Jr.\u2019s corporate Imex address. The message contained an attachment\nof Photoshopped passport scans for two men: \u201cRuslan Khalimovich Tabarov\u201d and\n\u201cNicolai Popa.\u201d These were fake identities of Mishkin and Chepiga, the Unit\n29155 operatives who would go on to poison the Skripals in Salisbury.\n\n##### Photoshopped passport pages for Unit 29155 operatives Alexander Mishkin\nand Anatoly Chepiga, sent by their commander Gen. Andrey Averyanov, so they\ncould gain access to the Vrb\u011btice storage facility\n\nAt 8:31 a.m. on Saturday, October 11, Bernatik Jr. forwarded the email to his\nassistant. Bernatik Jr. had no other correspondence on that day, nor did he\nconduct any other duties for Imex Group. He did, however, call \u0160apo\u0161nikov\nbefore and after forwarding Averyanov\u2019s message. A little over an hour after\nforwarding Averyanov\u2019s email, just before 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, Mishkin\nand Chepiga cleared passport control in Prague. Later that day, they checked\ninto the Florentina Boat Hotel in the Czech capital, where they mingled and\nflirted with a young Ukrainian woman, using the same absurd cover story they\u2019d\nuse for the Skirpal assassination: they were traveling sports nutritionists.\n\nOn Monday, October 13, Bernatik Jr.\u2019s assistant instructed the warehouse\nauthority in Vrb\u011btice to allow entry for \u201cRuslan Tabarov\u201d and \u201cNicolai Popa\u201d\nanytime between October 14th and 17th.\n\nThe \u0160apo\u0161nikovs were at that exact moment meeting with Averyanov and his\ndeputy Alexey Kapinos at the Gino Paradize Hotel in Besenova, a village in\nSlovakia. En route to the hotel, the \u0160apo\u0161nikovs would have passed through the\ncity of \u017dilina, where another Unit 29155 operative, Nikolay Ezhov, was staying\nat the Polom Hotel, having arrived from Moscow together with Averyanov.\n\nThe complicity of Alexey Kapinos and Nikolay Ezhov, along with several other\nmembers of Unit 29155, to the targeted explosions in Vrbetice, were previously\ndisclosed by a joint investigation by The Insider and Bellingcat. The new\ndetails provided by Czech investigators corroborate and supplement The\nInsider's findings which were based on analysis of travel data, shown in the\nmap below.\n\n##### Timeline and map of arrivals of members of 29155 in the area of the\nVrbetice explosions in October 2014\n\nWarehouse 16 blew up at 9:30 a.m. on October 16, turning the entire building\ninto a giant inferno with secondary explosions caused by igniting gunpowder\nand incendiaries. The resulting blast was so severe that an hour later, the\nInstitute of Geophysics at the Czech Academy of Science registered a large\nearthquake. Two Imex Group employees, Lud\u011bk Pet\u0159\u00edk and Vratislav Havr\u00e1nek,\nwere killed instantly while conducting an inspection of aircraft engines and\n152-millimeter artillery shells belonging to EMCO. Both Pet\u0159\u00edk and Havr\u00e1nek\nwere ripped apart instantly; shrapnel from a Soviet PG-15 anti-tank grenade, a\ntype of munition was later recovered from the severed remains of one of them.\n\nA month and a half later, on December 3, artillery, mortars, and assault\nrifles \u2013 much of it owned by EMCO \u2013 began exploding in Warehouse 12 in the\nsame Vrb\u011btice facility.\n\n### The Telltale Passport\n\nThe \u0160apo\u0161nikovs were initially confronted by Czech investigators in 2021 with\nthe array of incriminating overlaps between their actions, meetings, and\ncommunications with Unit 29155 and the explosions not only in Czechia, but\nalso at arms warehouses in Bulgaria. As The Insider was the first to report,\nUnit 29155\u2019s first kinetic operation on EU and NATO soil took place in the\nBulgarian village of Lovnidol in 2011, after other operatives from the unit,\nusing homemade detonators, blew up yet another EMCO consignment of artillery\nshells recently transported from the Vrb\u011btice facility. Bulgaria was\nsubsequently the target of 6 additional bombings or acts of arson, all\nperpetrated by Unit 29155.\n\nThe \u0160apo\u0161nikovs were subjected to several interrogations, conducted via the\nproxies of the Greek and Bulgarian authorities (the couple refused to travel\nto Czechia to submit themselves to questioning there). They repeatedly changed\ntheir testimony to try to account for new, independently sourced evidence with\nwhich they were confronted. Their main argument in favor of their innocence\nwas that all their links to Unit 29155 were \u201cpersonal\u201d or driven by the\nlegitimate business interests of Imex Group. The \u0160apo\u0161nikovs claimed they did\nnot know Andrey Averyanov or Alexey Kapinos were members of an internationally\nwanted state terrorist organization. They further insisted that they did not\nknowingly assist Unit 29155 with any of their sabotage operations. The couple\nhas accused Czech authorities of political persecution owing to their Russian\nheritage. Moreover, there is no predicate offense, as the 2014 explosions in\nVrb\u011btice, they maintain, were the result of industrial accidents.\n\nThe \u0160apo\u0161nikovs\u2019 defense is unlikely to withstand the weight of forensic\nevidence compiled by Czech investigators \u2014 or the new discovery made by The\nInsider as this story was going to press.\n\nTravel and border crossing data, recently made available thanks to an\navalanche of terabytes leaked from Russian government databases, showed that\nElena \u0160apo\u0161nikova is in possession of a secret Russian passport. Critically,\nher nine-digit passport number is part of a numerical range reserved\nexclusively for members of Unit 29155, differing from those of her colleagues\nonly by its last two digits. \u0160apo\u0161nikova\u2019s is 646518955.\n\n##### Passport numbers reserved exclusively for members of GRU Unit 29155\n\n\u0160apo\u0161nikova used this passport to travel between Greece and Russia on at least\ntwo occasions, once in December 2015 and the second time in December 2017. In\nboth cases, she used sophisticated tradecraft that sought to leave no trace in\ndatabases accessible to European authorities. For instance, she booked her\ntrips and bought her plane tickets using her Czech passport, registering only\nthat nationality with the Greek airline. But upon crossing the Russian border,\n\u0160apo\u0161nikova used her secret Russian passport, thus bypassing the need to\nobtain a Russian visa issued to her as a Czech citizen and eliding the digital\nfootprint associated with the relevant application.\n\nNotably, \u0160apo\u0161nikova\u2019s first trip to Moscow under her GRU service passport\nlasted only two days. She traveled from Thessaloniki to Moscow on December 3,\n2015 and left on December 5. The trip was short but sweet. It was on this\nvisit that Vladimir Putin bestowed her Hero of the Russian Federation title, a\ndecoration the naturalized Czech arms dealer and hotelier now shares with many\nof her colleagues in Russia\u2019s elite band of murderers and saboteurs.\n\nWith additional reporting by Kato Kopaleishvili.\n\n##### SEE ALSO\n\n### Exclusive: Inside an Infamous Russian Spy Unit\u2019s First Bombing in NATO\n\n### Diplomats with a bomb: How Russia's GRU blew up an arms depot in Czechia\n\nWe really need your help!
