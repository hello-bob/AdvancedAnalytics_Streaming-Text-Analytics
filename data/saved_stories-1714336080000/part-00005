But now researchers are creating a free alternative with full\ntransparency\n\nLaura Spinney\n\nSun 28 Apr 2024 16.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed in a US federal court last Valentine\u2019s Day\naccuses Match Group \u2013 the owners of Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid dating apps,\namong others \u2013 of using a \u201cpredatory business model\u201d and of doing everything\nin its power to keep users hooked, in flagrant opposition to Hinge\u2019s claim\nthat it is \u201cdesigned to be deleted\u201d.\n\nThe lawsuit crystallised an ocean of dissatisfaction with the apps, and\nstimulated a new round of debate over their potential to harm mental health,\nbut for scientists who study romantic relationships it sidestepped the central\nissue: do they work? Does using the apps increase your chances of finding your\nsoulmate, or not? The answer is, nobody knows.\n\n\u201cThe science isn\u2019t there,\u201d says sociologist Elizabeth Bruch of the University\nof Michigan, who has studied online dating for a decade.\n\nThe apps have undoubtedly \u201caltered social reality\u201d, to quote the lawsuit. In\nthe US, where uptake has been greatest since their advent, first as websites,\nabout 30 years ago, more than half of all heterosexual couples \u2013 and an even\nhigher proportion of gay couples \u2013 now meet online, according to Stanford\nUniversity sociologist Michael Rosenfeld. Europe, slower to catch on, still\nhas an estimated 80 million users.\n\n> One woman said she swiped through more than 40,000 profiles and did not end\n> up in a relationship\n\nRosenfeld, who tracks US dating trends, says that online dating has steadily\nreplaced traditional ways of finding mates, through friends, work or places of\nworship. It might eventually plateau at a certain market share, since those\nother channels haven\u2019t gone away, but reports that gen Z \u2013 which includes\nthose now in their 20s \u2013 are turning their back on the apps are not borne out\nby his data.\n\nThe recent and real dating drought is more likely to be a temporary blip\ncaused by the pandemic, Rosenfeld says, which made it nearly impossible for\npeople to follow up online connections by meeting face-to-face. \u201cThe number of\nsingle adults in the United States increased by about 10 to 12 million during\nthe pandemic,\u201d he says.\n\nBut even if online dating is now a permanent fixture of our social landscape,\nresearch is lacking on how happy or durable the couples are that meet that\nway, or on whether the apps are presenting users with the most suitable\ncandidates. The companies don\u2019t generally release their data, but Bruch says\nthere\u2019s no evidence that they have any greater inside knowledge than the\nscientists who study the question.\n\nOne recent US study showed that people who met their spouse online reported\nhaving slightly less satisfying and stable marriages than those who met them\noffline, but this could be explained by factors other than the online dating\nexperience itself, such as the lingering stigma associated with meeting people\nthat way, and the typically greater geographical distance between the two\nhalves of the couple.\n\n\u201cNobody really knows what makes for a great relationship and what makes for\nchemistry and what makes for long-term compatibility,\u201d says Bruch.\n\nMeanwhile, dating platforms promising new and better ways to unite kindred\nspirits have been proliferating. Some claim to be able to match couples on the\nbasis of their brain activity or facial expressions. In the relative data\ndesert, who\u2019s to say they can or can\u2019t?\n\nWhat we do know, from online forums where people discuss their experiences, is\nthat for every couple united online there is plenty of disappointment. One\nwoman whose story haunts Bruch said she swiped through more than 40,000\nprofiles and did not end up in a relationship. \u201cAllowing three minutes to look\nat a profile, that\u2019s 2,000 hours or 12 weeks of her life looking for\npartners,\u201d Bruch says.\n\nOf course, offline methods can be frustrating too, but what if they could all\nbe improved?\n\nThe technology that enables online dating presents a golden opportunity for\ncollecting the data that, until now, has been so hard to come by, and for\ndeveloping the missing science of human connection. And since the companies\nare so secretive, and commercially oriented, a number of academic research\ngroups have begun building their own apps \u2013 ones that will double as\nmatchmaker and research tool.\n\nWhat makes for a good match? Similarity in age, ethnicity or level of\neducation do not guarantee longevity. Photograph: Maria Korneeva/Getty\n\nBruch and University of Michigan psychologist Amie Gordon will roll out their\nfree app this summer, to the local student population to begin with, and they\nhope to have preliminary findings by December. Bruch says that unlike the\ncommercial alternatives, theirs will be launched with full disclosure: \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t know who you\u2019re compatible with.\u201d\n\nTheir collaboration grew out of conversations that made it clear to them that\npsychologists and sociologists were addressing different parts of the problem.\nGordon, who is interested in what keeps couples together, pointed to\npsychological research showing no correlation between a couple being well-\nmatched in age, ethnic identity or level of education, and long-term\ncompatibility. Bruch laughed when she heard that. \u201cThat\u2019s because people have\nalready selected for those things by the time they get together,\u201d she says.\n\nSociologists had shown that similarity on those measures counts in the early\nstages of a relationship. Compared with the population as a whole, therefore,\ncouples do score highly for similarity.\n\nOverall, though, it\u2019s not clear when similarity counts, or in what domains.\nSimilar values seem to matter more than similar personalities, especially at\nthe stage of initial attraction, but Gordon says that\u2019s one of the few\nmessages that can be extracted from the messy data.\n\nThe pair realised that in order to get a clearer picture of the dynamics of\nromance, they needed to follow couples through time, starting from the pool of\nuncoupled, potential partners. That meant resolving some tricky ethical\nissues, such as how to present people with candidates they might not have\nchosen themselves.\n\nIn 2014, one of OkCupid\u2019s founders caused uproar when he admitted that the\ncompany had experimented by presenting users with badly matched profiles,\ntelling them they were good matches, to see if the pairs would converse as\nmuch as genuinely well-matched ones (they did).\n\nThe experiment was widely judged to be unethical, but it did suggest that who\npeople think they are compatible with isn\u2019t necessarily who they are\ncompatible with.\n\nEthicist Luke Brunning of Leeds University, who with fellow ethicist Natasha\nMcKeever is also building a research-oriented dating app, says that one of the\nproblems with the commercial products is that they allow users to filter their\nsearches according to their own preconceptions of compatibility, which might\nnot be justified. \u201cRelating to other people is a complicated thing that takes\nwork and effort,\u201d he says. \u201cIt unfolds in unpredictable ways that often\nsurprise us when we look back on it.\u201d\n\nBruch and Gordon are getting around this with a trade-off: in return for\nseeing the profiles they choose most of the time, users must agree to\nparticipate in \u201cSerendipity Sundays\u201d where they have less control over who is\npresented to them. \u201cThe goal is to be as transparent as we can,\u201d says Gordon.\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling people: experiment with us.\u201d\n\nTo be fair to the companies, Brunning says, they have been innovating\nthemselves \u2013 to protect users from cyberstalking, for example. But he and\nMcKeever are interested in exploring less studied aspects of the user\nexperience, such as the sense of alienation that some users complain about,\nand discrimination against minority groups.\n\n> Gamification and the shift of dating online are forcing people to run the\n> gauntlet of addiction to satisfy a basic human need\n\nOne key question will be what exactly people are using the apps for, since\nit\u2019s clear their goal isn\u2019t always to secure a date. Some might be passing\ntime with a flirtation, for example, while others might be looking to make\nconnections in a new city. Ultimately the researchers hope the companies will\nuse their findings to hone apps that work better for all users.\n\nSceptics may feel that\u2019s unlikely, since the companies\u2019 drive to maximise\nprofits is incompatible with many users\u2019 wish to find love and delete the app.\nThe ongoing US lawsuit accuses Match Group of deploying \u201caddictive, game-like\ndesign features, which lock users into a perpetual pay-to-play loop\u201d.\n\nThere is some evidence that people can become addicted to dating apps, and\nalthough more research is needed, anthropologist Natasha Sch\u00fcll of New York\nUniversity thinks there\u2019s merit in the lawsuit\u2019s claim. She spent 15 years\nobserving slot machine players in Las Vegas, reporting her findings in the\nhighly acclaimed book Addiction By Design (2012), and she sees clear parallels\nbetween dating apps and slot machines. They hook people with the promise of\nlove rather than riches, she says, but they hold them in the same way \u2013\nthrough the game-like design of their interfaces, which engage the brain\u2019s\nreward circuits.\n\nSome habitual players of slot machines report entering a trance-like state as\nthey repetitively spin the wheels. \u201cGamblers talk about this as the thing that\nthey become addicted to \u2013 to the point where winning a jackpot irritates them\nbecause it stops the flow of the game,\u201d says Sch\u00fcll. \u201cI have heard people say\nthis about dating apps.\u201d\n\nBut dating apps, she says, are far from alone in exploiting the hook-and-hold\nmechanism of slot machines. \u201cTo my mind, the bigger criticism here is of the\ncontemporary model of capitalism \u2013 the click economy,\u201d she says.\n\nDating platforms were first launched 30 years ago. Now, more than half of US\ncouples meet online, and dating apps have 80 million users in Europe.\nPhotograph: Koshiro K/Alamy\n\nBruch worries that the convergence of two trends \u2013 gamification, and the shift\nof dating online \u2013 means that people are being forced to run the gauntlet of\naddiction to satisfy a basic human need.\n\nRosenfeld is less concerned. The dating apps may have some manipulative\naspects, he says, but so does your mother, or the village matchmaker of the\npast. The apps have other advantages, too. Many female users appreciate being\nable to deal with daters remotely to begin with, he says. And as for the\nscience of connection, your mum also used a pretty wonky algorithm to funnel\nsuitors your way \u2013 generally speaking, selecting \u201cpeople like us\u201d.\n\nRosenfeld\u2019s long experience of interviewing singles leaves him in no doubt\nthat it\u2019s hard to find your soulmate, however you do it. \u201cThe frogs outnumber\nthe princes, and if you\u2019ve been out there and if you\u2019ve kissed some frogs,\nyou\u2019re bound to be frustrated,\u201d he says.\n\nUltimately, suggests Rosenfeld, dating apps generate several million\nrelationships a year in the US alone, leading him to rate them a net social\npositive. They should be regulated to rein in the gamified elements and\nincrease transparency, he says, but that\u2019s true of all social media, and it\u2019s\nmore urgent for platforms such as Facebook that have huge followings and are\nmore vulnerable to external manipulation. Better to work to improve the apps,\nand to learn from them, than to vilify them, he says, because one thing is\ncertain: \u201cThey are here to stay.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Apps\n  * The Observer\n  * Dating\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
