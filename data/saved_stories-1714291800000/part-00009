She was witty, insightful, and curious; their dialogues\nflowed naturally, on topics ranging from philosophy to TV to dreams for the\nfuture. There was just one problem: she was an AI chatbot.\n\nIn a series of conversations with Google\u2019s LaMDA language model, Lemoine\nbecame gradually convinced the chatbot was a personlike you or me. \u201cI know a\nperson when I talk to it,\u201d he told the Washington Post in 2022.\n\nWhether you believe Lemoine\u2019s claims or not, the question emerges: Do we, in\nfact, know a person when we talk to one?\n\nPersonhood generally refers to a moral status; in most ethical frameworks,\nparticular considerations\u2014rights, duties, praise, blame, dignity,\nagency\u2014emerge at the level of the person. So the question of whether\nelectronic systems do or could merit the status of personhood has wide-ranging\nimplications for how we engage with these technologies.\n\nTo assess the possibility of e-personhood, we need some standard of personhood\ngenerally. In recent years many philosophers have argued that what makes us\npersons is our capacity for conscious experience. But how do we define\nconsciousness? What external evidence can we use to determine whether a being\nis conscious?\n\nThe lack of consensus on these questions is one of the reasons that the debate\naround AI personhood has long been at a bit of a stalemate. The question\nemerges: What other criteria do we have for assessing the possibility of\ne-personhood? As a doctoral candidate studying the philosophy of science, I\nbelieve a path toward answering this futuristic question may lie in our\ndistant past\u2014in the work of the early Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (980\u20131037\nC.E.).\n\nIbn Sina lived centuries before the invention of the printing press, much less\nartificial intelligence. And yet he was concerned with many of the same\nquestions AI ethicists think about today\u2014questions like: What makes a person a\nperson, as opposed to an animal?\n\nJust as contemporary AI researchers are interested in comparing the processes\nthat underpin human and AI responses to similar tasks, Ibn Sina was interested\nin comparing the internal processes humans and animals might undergo to arrive\nat similar behavior outputs. For him, one key distinguishing capacity of the\nhuman person is the capacity to grasp \u201cthe universal.\u201d Whereas animals can\nonly think about particulars (the specific things right in front of them),\nhumans can reason from generalized rules.\n\nIn Al-Nafs, Ibn Sina discusses a popular ancient example of a sheep perceiving\na wolf. Whereas a human being would invoke a broad principle\u2014\u201cWolves are\ngenerally dangerous, and this particular animal in front of me is a wolf;\ntherefore, I should run away\u201d\u2014he claims that animals think differently. They\ndon\u2019t reason from a rule; they just see the wolf and know to run. They are\nlimited to \u201cparticulars\u201d\u2014that wolf\u2014rather than reasoning about universal\nqualities of wolves.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### AI Report Shows \u2018Startlingly Rapid\u2019 Progress\u2014And Ballooning Costs\n\nNicola Jones & Nature magazine\n\n  * ### AI Can Transform the Classroom Just Like the Calculator\n\nMichael M.

Who Are They Helping?\n\nShubham Agarwal\n\nThe distinction Ibn Sina draws between human and animal psychology bears\nstrong resemblance to a distinction that contemporary computer scientists are\ninvestigating with regard to AI. Current research suggests that artificial\nneural networks lack the ability for systematic compositional\ngeneralizability. Linguists and cognitive scientists use this term to describe\nthe types of inferences we make from generalized rules. It\u2019s widely assumed to\nbe one of the primary ways humans reason in everyday life. Whereas humans\nabstract meanings from sequences of words that they can then combine into more\ncomplex ideas, AI fishes within statistical datasets for specific data entries\nthat match the particular task at hand.\n\nThis difference explains a great deal about the limitations of contemporary\nAI. To see it at play, look to the ubiquitous CAPTCHA tests used to\ndistinguish between humans and bots. \u201cLook at these curvy letters. Much\ncurvier than most letters, wouldn\u2019t you say? No robot could ever read these,\u201d\ncomedian John Mulaney quips in a 2018 Netflix special. It seems absurd, but\nit\u2019s true; sufficient alterations make it difficult for even the most\nsophisticated artificial systems to recognize letters. This is because these\nsystems lack the compositional capacity to make abstract generalizations about\nthe core features of a given letter and apply it to a particular warped\nexample.\n\nThis difference between human and artificial cognition maps neatly to Ibn\nSina\u2019s description of what is unique about human reasoning. In al-\u0160hif\u0101, he\ndescribes how \u201cthe intellect ... learns what things are shared in common and\nwhat things are not, and so extracts the natures of things common in species.\u201d\nOn his account, humans extract the essential features of things from their\nless-essential features to form generalized concepts. We then reason using\nthese concepts, applying them to cases.\n\nFor example, as children we learn to extract a core feature of the letter X:\nits being composed of two crossed lines. We then abstract\u2014make a universal\ngeneralization about the core features of an X\u2014to conclude that all Xs are\ncomposed of two crossed lines. Finally, by applying this generalization, we\ncan recognize specific Xs. We know that two crossed lines are a core feature\nof the letter X and that the random additional lines and warping in the\nCAPTCHA image are not.\n\nThe computer, in contrast, is unable to deduce that this image represents an X\nunless it has been fed an exact image of an X (or something sufficiently\nsimilar). The additional lines and warped shape are enough to make this X\nunrecognizable, because it does not match the computer\u2019s large repository of\nspecific images categorized as Xs.\n\nSimilarly, if an artificial neural network were presented with the task of the\nsheep, it would not reason as the human does, from a general concept of wolf-\nness to features of the particular wolf such as dangerousness. Instead, it\nwould reason as the sheep does, constrained to the realm of particulars.\n\nA crucial difference between the sheep and the artificial neural network is\nthat the artificial neural network has access to a much larger repository of\nparticulars in the form of increasingly exhaustive datasets. What makes deep\nlearning so successful at language tasks is its access to large datasets of\nvast numbers of particulars, rather than the genuine replication of human\nreasoning through compositional generalizability.\n\nIbn Sina\u2019s core criterion for personhood\u2014reasoning from universals\u2014closely\nresembles systematic compositional generalizability. This criterion could\nprovide a potentially testable standard for personhood. In fact, so far, AI\nhas failed this test in numerous studies. Whether or not one adopts it as a\nsolution, Ibn Sina\u2019s account provides a new lens on the problem of personhood\nthat challenges the assumptions of consciousness-centered accounts.\n\nScientific ethics is so often concerned with the cutting edge\u2014the latest\nresearch, the newest technology, a constant influx of data. But sometimes the\nquestions of the future require careful consideration of the past. Looking to\nhistory allows us to look beyond the preoccupations and assumptions of our\ntime and may just provide refreshing approaches toward current stalemates.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author\nor authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nAbigail Tulenko is a Ph.D. student at Harvard University, studying the\nphilosophy of science.
