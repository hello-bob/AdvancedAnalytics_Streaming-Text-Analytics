Sold on the digital\nfashion e-tailer The Fabricant, 1,500 NFTs are being offered for $616 each,\nwhile 15 are being offered for $8,400 each. Those making the larger investment\nreceive a limited-edition, handmade pair of the brand\u2019s Tabi boots. Members of\nthe larger group get a custom leather wallet.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Mmerch debuted a collection of phygital fashion products\ndeveloped using generative AI in collaboration with illustrations by artist\nGilbert Hernandez. Each of the 960 available NFTs corresponds to a unique\nhoodie, with variations in their sleeves, pocket, hood and edges. The phygital\nsets are selling for $460 each on the brand\u2019s e-commerce site.\n\nThe ongoing trend of fashion brands rolling out digital and phygital products\nis being fueled by luxury consumers\u2019 demand for unique experiences and other\nperks. Plus, the adoption of blockchain \u2014 which mints NFTs \u2014 is poised for\nacceleration. By 2026, products sold in the E.U. will be required to have\ndigital product passports.\n\nOwnership of a Margiela MetaTABI NFT grants access to exclusive digital\nwearables within platforms like The Sandbox and Ready Player Me. In addition,\nit ensures priority access to the brand\u2019s future web3 projects, AR experiences\nand exclusive events.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives drive long-term loyalty within the digital community,\u201d said\nStefano Rosso, chairman of Maison Margiela. \u201cThey incentivize community\nengagement from the beginning and foster a sense of belonging to a project\nthat will continue to add value and utility over time.\u201d\n\nBut for Mmerch, it\u2019s the customized physical products \u2014 not their\ncorresponding NFTs \u2014 that are drawing attention to its phygital collection\nlaunch.\n\n\u201cPeople really value the physical components of their digital assets,\u201d said\nColby Mugrabi, founder of Mmerch. She noted that the collectors won\u2019t know\nwhat hoodie they\u2019ve bought until they mint their NFT.\n\nIn March, Mmerch \u2014 which specializes in phygital fashion goods \u2014 announced a\n$6.4 million seed funding round led by Liberty City Ventures.\n\nTo market the launch, on April 15, Maison Margiela hosted an X Spaces event,\nwhich attracted over 1,000 listeners who were keen to learn about the MetaTABI\nproject.\n\n\u201cTrue to the ethos of web3, but also true to great fashion, this approach [of\ncommunication] creates a sense of belonging and engagement among collectors,\nbridging the gap between virtual and physical experiences,\u201c said Rosso.\n\nIn addition, the brand actively participates on Discord, where it has 10,000\nmembers.\n\nBy leveraging Discord and other community engagement tools, brands can glean\nmore about their customers. For example, just to enter the Margiela Discord\nrequires users to answer questions about which OTB brands they are interested\nin and where they are from. Users\u2019 interactions shape their experiences, thus\nfostering a sense of belonging and long-term loyalty within the digital\ncommunity.\n\nOTB owns Maison Margiela, along with Marni and and Diesel. In 2023, it\nrecorded revenue of \u20ac1.9 billion ($2 billion).\n\nMerch\u2019s Discord has nearly 250 members and more than 2,000 X followers. On\nthese platforms, the brand saw 328,000 impressions in the 28 days leading up\nto its phygital collection launch.\n\nBrands including LVMH, Lacoste and Crocs have also launched phygital products\nover the last couple of years.\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\nRelated reads\n\n  * Member Exclusive\n\nLuxury Briefing: Luxury resale saturation is changing how people shop\n\n  * The Glossy Fashion Podcast\n\nThe Normal Brand\u2019s Jimmy and Lan Sansone: \u2018To build a lasting brand, you need\na brick-and-mortar presence\u2019\n\n  * Fashion\n\nRixo embarks on U.S. expansion with new website and pop-up shop\n\nLatest Stories\n\n  * Beauty\n\nJergens introduces \u2018And Just Like That\u2019 star as brand ambassador\n\n  * Beauty\n\n20-year-old Coola gets a refresh\n\n  * Member Exclusive\n\nLuxury Briefing: Luxury resale saturation is changing how people shop\n\nGet news and analysis about fashion, beauty and culture delivered to your\ninbox every morning.\n\nReach Out\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * Instagram\n  * Threads\n  * Email\n\nAbout Us\n\n  * About Us\n  * Masthead\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Digiday Media\n  * Custom\n  * FAQ\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n\n\u00a92024 Digiday Media.
