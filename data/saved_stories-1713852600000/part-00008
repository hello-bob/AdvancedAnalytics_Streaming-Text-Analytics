The Future of Humanity Institute, dedicated to\nthe long-termism movement and other Silicon Valley-endorsed ideas such as\neffective altruism, closed this week after 19 years of operation. Musk had\ndonated \u00a31m to the FHI in 2015 through a sister organization to research the\nthreat of artificial intelligence. He had also boosted the ideas of its leader\nfor nearly a decade on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nTesla asks shareholders to back $56bn pay for Elon Musk rejected by judge\n\nRead more\n\nThe center was run by Nick Bostrom, a Swedish-born philosopher whose writings\nabout the long-term threat of AI replacing humanity turned him into a\ncelebrity figure among the tech elite and routinely landed him on lists of top\nglobal thinkers. Sam Altman of OpenAI, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Musk all\nwrote blurbs for his 2014 bestselling book Superintelligence.\n\n\u201cWorth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom. We need to be super careful with\nAI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes,\u201d Musk tweeted in 2014.\n\nBostrom resigned from Oxford following the institute\u2019s closure, he said.\n\nThe closure of Bostrom\u2019s center is a further blow to the effective altruism\nand long-termism movements that the philosopher had spent decades championing,\nand which in recent years have become mired in scandals related to racism,\nsexual harassment and financial fraud. Bostrom himself issued an apology last\nyear after a decades-old email surfaced in which he claimed \u201cBlacks are more\nstupid than whites\u201d and used the N-word.\n\nBostrom \u2013 who popularized the theory that humanity may be living in a\nsimulation, one that Musk often repeats \u2013 spoke about the closure of the\ninstitute in a lengthy final report published on its website this week. He\npraised the work of the center, while also saying that it faced\n\u201cadministrative headwinds\u201d from Oxford and its philosophy department.\n\n\u201cThe closure is the culmination of process that\u2019s been playing out over\nseveral years,\u201d Bostrom said via email. \u201cWe were funded initially for three\nyears, back in 2005, and then that got extended a number of times.\n\n\u201cEventually a pressure to conform began bearing down (we were administratively\nhoused within the faculty of philosophy, even though the majority of our\nresearch team by this time were non-philosophers), and there was a death by\nbureaucracy.\u201d\n\nBostrom added that he was touched by the number of people speaking out in\nsupport of the institute\u2019s work, and that it had been a privilege to work with\nhis colleagues.\n\n\u201cFHI was a special place with a unique and highly fruitful intellectual\nculture,\u201d Bostrom said. \u201cI think we had a good run!\u201d\n\nA statement on the Future of Humanity\u2019s website claimed that Oxford had frozen\nfundraising and hiring in 2020, and that in late 2023 the faculty of\nphilosophy decided to not renew the contracts of remaining staff at the\ninstitute.\n\nAn Oxford University spokesman said: \u201cWe regularly consider the best\nstructures for conducting our academic research, as part of the university\u2019s\ngovernance processes. After such consideration, the decision was made to close\nthe Future of Humanity Institute. The university recognises the Institute\u2019s\nimportant contribution to this emerging field, which researchers elsewhere\nacross the university are likely to continue.\u201d\n\nEffective altruism, the utilitarian belief that people should focus their\nlives and resources on maximizing the amount of global good they can do, has\nbecome a heavily promoted philosophy in recent years. The philosophers at the\ncenter of it, such as Oxford professor William MacAskill, also became the\nsubject of immense amounts of news coverage and glossy magazine profiles. One\nof the movement\u2019s biggest backers was Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-disgraced\nformer billionaire who founded the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nBostrom is a proponent of the related long-termism movement, which held that\nhumanity should concern itself mostly with long-term existential threats to\nits existence such as AI and space travel. Critics of long-termism tend to\nargue that the movement applies an extreme calculus to the world that\ndisregards tangible current problems, such as climate change and poverty, and\nveers into authoritarian ideas. In one paper, Bostrom proposed the concept of\na universally worn \u201cfreedom tag\u201d that would constantly surveil individuals\nusing AI and relate any suspicious activity to a police force that could\narrest them for threatening humanity.\n\nBostrom and long-termism gained numerous powerful supporters over the years,\nincluding Musk and other tech billionaires. Bostrom\u2019s Institute received\n\u00a313.3m in 2018 from the Open Philanthropy Project, a non-profit financially\nbacked by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.\n\nThe past few years have been tumultuous for effective altruism, however, as\nBankman-Fried\u2019s multibillion-dollar fraud marred the movement and spurred\naccusations that its leaders ignored warnings about his conduct. Concerns over\neffective altruism being used to whitewash the reputation of Bankman-Fried,\nand questions over what good effective altruist organizations are actually\ndoing, proliferated in the years since his downfall.\n\nMeanwhile, Bostrom\u2019s email from the 1990s resurfaced last year and resulted in\nhim issuing a statement repudiating his racist remarks and clarifying his\nviews on subjects such as eugenics. Some of his answers \u2013 \u201cDo I support\neugenics? No, not as the term is commonly understood\u201d \u2013 led to further\ncriticism from fellow academics that he was being evasive.\n\nThe university launched an investigation into Bostrom\u2019s conduct following the\ndiscovery of his racist email, while other major effective altruism groups\ndistanced themselves from him.\n\n\u201cWe unequivocally condemn Nick Bostrom\u2019s recklessly flawed and reprehensible\nwords,\u201d the Centre for Effective Altruism, which was founded by fellow Oxford\nphilosophers and financially backed by Bankman-Fried, said in a statement at\nthe time.\n\nThis article was amended on 21 April 2024 to add a comment from Oxford\nUniversity.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Elon Musk\n  * University of Oxford\n  * Philosophy\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Education\n  * Schools\n  * Teachers\n  * Universities\n  * Students\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
