It is the best way of\nsaving hours every day. Instead of improving your productivity with shortcuts\nor apps like Superhuman, simply let our AI learn about you and answer all your\nemails instead of you. You don't need to click or instruct the AI, it works on\nmobile and desktop and writes emails even when you're not in Gmail. Upon\nopening your inbox, you'll see the new drafts, ready to be sent. Your inbox\ncontains everything you ever sent and therefore a big part of your knowledge.\nStop repeating the same things and let Auto Gmail do the work. You stay in the\ndriver seat of course and no email is ever sent without you actually hitting\nthat \"Send\" button. Upon installation, drafts will appear even on the mobile\napp, allowing you to answer faster while on the go. You can instruct the AI\nand give it additional context such as links you'd like it to use (calendar\nlinks, tutorials, product pages and so on). Under the hood, Auto Gmail works\nby connecting to the Gmail API and uses ChatGPT (GPT 4) and Llama-3 to draft\nemail answers. For context, the most similar emails are passed along to help\nChatGPT draft the most relevant answers. Auto Gmail retrains every few days on\nyour latest messages to stay up to date on new knowledge you sent per email.\nPricing: Five day trial, then $27/mo or $197/year. For people sending many\nemails, we have a Max plan at $47/mo\n\nSee more\n\n##\n\n5 out of 5\n\n2 ratings\n\nGoogle doesn't verify reviews.
