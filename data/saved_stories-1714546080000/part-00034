Even the\noriginal storytellers got some things just plain wrong. After extensive\nresearch, writer Nickolai Belakovski is able to present, for the first time to\nan English-speaking audience, the complete story of Soyuz T-13\u2019s mission to\nsave Salyut 7, a fascinating piece of in-space repair history.\n\nIt\u2019s getting dark, and Vladimir Dzhanibekov is cold. He has a flashlight, but\nno gloves. Gloves make it difficult to work, and he needs to work quickly. His\nhands are freezing, but it doesn\u2019t matter. His crew\u2019s water supplies are\nlimited, and if they don\u2019t fix the station in time to thaw out its water\nsupply, they\u2019ll have to abandon it and go home, but the station is too\nimportant to let that happen. Quickly, the sun sets. Working with the\nflashlight by himself is cumbersome, so Dzhanibekov returns to the ship that\nbrought them to the station to warm up and wait for the station to complete\nits pass around the night side of the Earth. [1]\n\nHe\u2019s trying to rescue Salyut 7, the latest in a series of troubled yet\nincreasingly successful Soviet space stations. Its predecessor, Salyut 6,\nfinally returned the title of longest manned space mission to the Soviets,\nbreaking the 84-day record set by Americans on Skylab in 1974 by 10 days. A\nlater mission extended that record to 185 days. After Salyut 7\u2019s launch into\norbit in April 1982, the first mission to the new station further extended\nthat record to 211 days. The station was enjoying a relatively trouble-free\nstart to life. [4]\n\nHowever, this was not to last. On February 11, 1985, while Salyut 7 was in\norbit on autopilot awaiting its next crew, mission control (TsUP) noticed\nsomething was off. Station telemetry reported that there had been a surge of\ncurrent in the electrical system, which led to the tripping of overcurrent\nprotection and the shutdown of the primary radio transmitter circuits. The\nbackup radio transmitters had been automatically activated, and as such there\nwas no immediate threat to the station. Mission controllers, very tired now\nthat the end of their 24-hour shift was approaching, made a note to call\nspecialists from the design bureaus for the radio and electrical systems. The\nspecialists would analyze the situation, and produce a report and\nrecommendation, but for now the station was fine, and the next shift was ready\nto come on duty.[9]\n\nWithout waiting for the specialists to arrive, or perhaps not bothering to\ncall them in the first place, the controllers on the next shift decided to\nreactivate the primary radio transmitter. Perhaps the overcurrent protection\nhad been tripped accidentally, and if not, then it should still be functional\nand should still activate if there really was a problem. The controllers,\nacting against established tradition and procedures of their office, sent the\ncommand to reactivate the primary radio transmitter. Instantly, a cascade of\nelectrical shorts swept through the station, and knocked out not only the\nradio transmitters, but also the receivers. At 1:20pm and 51 seconds on\nFebruary 11, 1985, Salyut 7 fell silent and unresponsive. [8][9]\n\n## What do we do now?\n\nThe situation put flight controllers in an uncomfortable position. One option\navailable to them was to simply abandon Salyut 7 and wait for its successor,\nMir, to become available before continuing the manned space program. Mir was\non schedule to be launched within one year, but waiting for Mir to become\navailable would not only mean suspending the space program for a year; it also\nmeant that a significant amount of scientific work and engineering tests\nplanned for Salyut 7 would have to go undone. Moreover, admitting defeat would\nbe an embarrassment for the Soviet space program, particularly painful\nconsidering the multitude of previous failures in the Salyut series as well as\nthe apparent successes the Americans were enjoying with the Space Shuttle. [9]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was only one other option: fly a repair crew to the station to fix it\nfrom the inside, manually. But this could easily become yet another failure.\nThe standard procedures for docking to a space station were entirely automated\nand relied heavily on information from the station itself about its precise\norbital and spatial coordinates. During those rare occurrences when the\nautomated system failed and a manual approach was required, the failures were\nall within several hundred meters of the station. How does one approach a\nsilent space station? [9] The lack of communication presented another problem:\nthere was no way to know the status of the onboard systems. While the station\nwas designed to fly autonomously, the automated systems could only cope with\nso many failures before human intervention would be required. The station\ncould be fine upon the repair crew's arrival, requiring no more repair work\nthan replacing the damaged transmitters, or there could have been a fire on\nthe station, or it could have depressurized from having been struck by space\ndebris, etc.; there would be no way to know.[3]\n\nIf there was a meeting in which top managers discussed and weighed all the\noptions, the notes of that meeting have not been made public. What *is* known,\nhowever, is that the Soviets decided to attempt a repair mission. This would\nmean rewriting the book on docking procedures from scratch and hoping that\nnothing else went wrong aboard the station while communication was down,\nbecause if something else did go wrong, the repair crew might not be able to\nhandle it. It was a bold move.\n\n## \u201cDocking with a non-cooperative object\u201d\n\nThe first order of business for the repair mission was figuring out how they\nwould get to the station. For an approach to the station under better\ncircumstances, the Soyuz (a 3-seat ship used to ferry cosmonauts to and from\nspace stations) would receive information from the station via mission control\n(TsUP) as soon as it reached orbit, long before the station would be visible\nto the crew. This communication would contain information about the orbit of\nthe space station so that the visiting craft could plot a rendezvous orbit.\nOnce the two craft were 20-25km apart, a direct line of communication would be\nestablished between the station and the ship, and the automated system would\nbring the two craft together and complete the docking.[3]\n\nPart 1: A depiction of a typical Soyuz rendezvous and docking. Part 2: A\ndepiction of the modified rendezvous and docking procedure employed for Soyuz\nT-13. Notice how in parts 2b and 2c the ship is actually flying sideways.\n\nepizodsspace.noip.org (translated by the author)\n\nAlthough all Soyuz pilots were trained to perform a manual docking, it was\nrare for the automated system to fail. Of those rare failures, the worst was\nin June 1982 on Soyuz T-6 when a computer failure stopped the automated\ndocking process 900m away from the station. Vladimir Dzhanibekov immediately\ntook over controls and successfully docked his Soyuz with Salyut 7 a full 14\nminutes ahead of schedule [4]. Naturally, Dzhanibekov was the leading\ncandidate to pilot any proposed mission to rescue Salyut 7.\n\nAn entirely new set of docking techniques had to be developed, and this was\ndone under a project titled \u201cdocking with a non-cooperative object.\u201d [5] The\nstation\u2019s orbit would be measured using ground-based radar, and this\ninformation would be communicated to the Soyuz, which would then plot a\nrendezvous course. The goal was to get the ship within 5km of the station,\nfrom which point it was deemed a manual docking was technically possible. [3]\nThe conclusion of those responsible for developing these new techniques were\nthat the odds of mission success were 70 to 80 percent, after proper\nmodifications to the Soyuz. [2],[3] The Soviet government accepted the risk,\ndeeming the station too valuable to simply let it fall from orbit\nuncontrolled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModifications to the Soyuz began. The automated docking system would be\nremoved entirely, and a laser rangefinder installed in the cockpit to assist\nthe crew in determining their distance and approach rate. The crew would also\nbring night vision goggles in case they had to dock with the station on the\nnight side. The third seat of the ship was removed, and extra supplies, like\nfood and, as would later prove critical, water, were brought on board. The\nweight saved by the removal of the automatic system and the third chair were\nused to fill the propellant tanks to their maximum possible level.\n[1],[3],[11]\n\n## Who would fly the mission?\n\nWhen it came to selecting a flight crew, two things were very important. First\nof all, the pilot should have had experience performing a manual docking in\norbit, not just in simulators, and secondly, the flight engineer would need to\nbe very familiar with Salyut 7\u2019s systems. Only three cosmonauts had completed\na manual docking in orbit. Leonid Kizim, Yuri Malyshev, and Vladimir\nDzhanibekov. Kizim had only recently returned from a long duration mission to\nSalyut 7, and was still undergoing rehabilitation from his spaceflight, which\nruled him out as a possible candidate. Malyshev had limited spaceflight\nexperience, and had not trained for Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA, or\nspacewalk), which would be required later in the mission to augment the\nstation\u2019s solar panels, provided the rehabilitation of the space station went\nwell.[1]\n\nThis left Dzhanibekov, who had flown in space four times for a week or two\neach time, but had trained for long duration missions and for EVA. However, he\nwas restricted from long duration flight by the medical community. Being at\nthe top of the short list for mission commander, Dzhanibekov was quickly\nplaced into the care of physicians who, after several weeks of medical tests\nand evaluation, cleared him for a flight lasting no more than 100 days. [1]\n\nTo fulfill the role of flight engineer the list was even shorter: just one\nperson. Victor Savinikh had flown once before, on a 74 day mission to Salyut\n6. During that mission he played host to Dzhanibekov and Mongolia\u2019s first\ncosmonaut as they visited the station on Soyuz 39. Moreover, he was already in\nthe process of training for the next long-duration mission to Salyut 7, which\nhad been scheduled to launch on May 15, 1985. [1]\n\nBy the middle of March, the crew had been firmly decided. Vladimir Dzhanibekov\nand Victor Savinikh were chosen to attempt one of the boldest, most\ncomplicated in-space repair efforts to date. [1]\n\n## Po\u2019yehali! Let\u2019s go!\n\nSalyut 7 as seen from the approaching Soyuz T-13 crew. Notice how the solar\npanels are slightly askew.\n\nWikimedia\n\nOn June 6, 1985, nearly four months after contact with the station had been\nlost, Soyuz T-13 launched with Vladimir Dzhanibekov as commander and Victor\nSavinikh as flight engineer. [1],[6] After two days of flight, the station\ncame into view.\n\nAs they approached the station, live video from their ship was being\ntransmitted to ground controllers. To the right is one of the images\ncontrollers saw.\n\nThe controllers noticed something very wrong: the station\u2019s solar arrays\nweren\u2019t parallel. This indicated a serious failure in the system which orients\nthe solar panels toward the sun, and immediately led to concerns about the\nentire electrical system of the station. [1]\n\nThe crew continued their approach.\n\n> Dzhanibekov: \u201cDistance, 200 meters. Engaging engines. Approaching the\n> station at 1.5 m/s, rotational speed of the station is normal, it\u2019s\n> practically stable. We\u2019re holding, and beginning our turn. Oh, the sun is in\n> a bad spot now... there, that\u2019s better. Docking targets aligned. Offset\n> between the ship and the station within normal parameters. Slowing down...\n> waiting for contact.\u201d\n\nSilently, slowly, the crew\u2019s Soyuz flew toward the forward docking port of the\nstation.\n\n> Savinikh: \u201cWe have contact. We have mechanical capture.\u201d\n\nThe successful docking to the station was a great victory, and demonstrated\nfor the first time in history that it was possible to rendezvous and dock with\nvirtually any object in space, but it was early to celebrate. The crew\nreceived no acknowledgement, either electrical or physical, from the station\nof their docking. One of the main fears about the mission, that something else\nwould go seriously wrong while the station was out of contact, was quickly\nbecoming a reality.\n\nA lack of information on the crew\u2019s screens about the pressure inside the\nstation led to concerns that the station had de-pressurized, but the crew\npressed ahead, carefully. Their first step would be to try to equalize the\npressure between the ship and the station, if possible.
