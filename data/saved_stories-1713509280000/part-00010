Credit: Chen Jie/VCG via Getty\n\nOne in ten residents of China\u2019s coastal cities could be living below sea level\nwithin a century, as a result of land subsidence and climate change, according\nto a paper published in Science today^1.\n\nSome 16% of the mapped area of China\u2019s major cities is sinking \u201crapidly\u201d \u2014\nfaster than 10 millimetres every year. An even greater area, roughly 45%, is\nsinking at a \u201cmoderate\u201d rate, the paper says, meaning a downward trajectory of\ngreater than 3 mm annually. Affected cities include the capital Beijing, as\nwell as regional capitals, including Fuzhou, Hefei and Xi\u2019an.\n\nThe situation could see one-quarter of China\u2019s coastal lands slip below sea\nlevel within a few decades, posing \u201cserious threats\u201d to the hundreds of\nmillions of people who live on the coast, the paper notes.\n\n## That sinking feeling\n\n\u201cSubsidence is certainly not only a problem in China. Many other parts of the\nworld share the same problem,\u201d says Ding Xiaoli, a geodesist at the Hong Kong\nPolytechnic University.\n\nSubsidence is when land sinks relative to sea level, usually owing to\nextraction of subsurface water, rock or other resources.\n\nIn the famously low-lying Netherlands, roughly one-quarter of the land has\nsubsided to below sea level. And by 2040, almost one-fifth of the world\u2019s\npopulation is projected to be living on sinking land.\n\nJakarta has become the most rapidly subsiding capital in the world, prompting\nIndonesia to propose a new capital city.\n\nIn the United States, more than 44,000 square kilometres of land across 45\nstates has been directly affected by subsidence, with more than 80% of the\ncases relating to groundwater extraction, often for agricultural purposes.\n\nDing says that the study provides an interesting snapshot of the situation in\nChina, and crucially links the issue to the populations affected.\n\nThe authors, led by Shengli Tao, a researcher in remote-sensing technology at\nPeking University in Beijing, assessed 82 cities across China with a\npopulation of more than 2 million. They used radar pulses from satellites to\nmeasure the changes in the distance between the satellite and the ground to\nexamine how its elevations changed between 2015 and 2022.\n\nThey found that the cities facing severe subsidence are concentrated in five\nregions, and cover both coastal and inland cities.\n\nAlso on the list are cities in the largely land-locked southwest, such as\nKunming, Nanning and Guiyang \u2014 a finding that surprises Zhou Yuyu, a\ngeographer at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cThese cities are not as densely\npopulated or industrialized as some other parts of China, yet they still\nexperience significant subsidence,\u201d he says.\n\n## Losing ground\n\nThe paper links a range of natural and human factors to sinking, such as the\ndepth of a city\u2019s bedrock, groundwater depletion, the weight of buildings, the\nuse of transport systems and underground mining.\n\nPrevious studies^2 have found that excessive groundwater extraction is a key\ncause of severe land subsidence in cities across the world.\n\nBut there are also stories of successful mitigation. Tokyo slowed its sinking\nfrom a rapid 240 mm a year in the 1960s to about 10 mm a year in the early\n2000s, after passing laws that limited groundwater pumping. Shanghai, China,\nwhich sank by a staggering 2.6 metres between 1921 and 1965, reduced its\nannual rate of sinking to about 5 mm after implementing a series of\nenvironmental regulations.\n\n\u201cThe key to addressing China\u2019s city subsidence could lie in the long-term,\nsustained control of groundwater extraction,\u201d the paper says.\n\nDing says that, in cities such as Macao and Hong Kong where no groundwater is\nused, subsidence mainly comes from consolidation \u2014 downward movement as a\nresult of soil being compressed \u2014 after land reclamation.\n\nThe authors also listed the weight of buildings as a factor. Contrary to\nexpectations, heavier buildings, such as the skyscrapers in Shanghai, tend to\nsink slower than lighter structures do, possibly because those buildings are\nanchored on deeper rock, according to the paper.\n\n## Double whammy\n\nAs cities sink, global sea levels are also rising owing to the effects of\nclimate change. This double whammy will cause 22\u201326% of China\u2019s coastal lands\nto drop below sea level by 2120, the paper says.\n\nWei Meng, a geophysicist at the Graduate School of Oceanography at the\nUniversity of Rhode Island in Kingston regards the figures as \u201cterrifying\u201d.\n\nIn 2022, Wei and his colleagues found that land was sinking faster than sea\nlevels were rising in many coastal cities worldwide. They predicted that these\ncities would be challenged by flooding \u201cmuch sooner\u201d than timelines projected\nby sea-level models if they continued to sink at current rates.\n\nClimate change might exacerbate sinking in other ways, such as by affecting\nwhere and when it rains \u2014 or doesn\u2019t rain.\n\n\u201cIncreasing droughts can prompt excessive groundwater extraction, contributing\nto subsidence in urban areas,\u201d Zhou says.\n\nDike systems could be a cost-efficient way to prevent inundation as cities\u2019\nelevations fall, the paper says.\n\nThe paper\u2019s authors did not reply to Nature\u2019s request for comment.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01149-7\n\n## References\n\n  1.
