Here\u2019s what experts think.\n\n## Can things be turned around at Tesla, or is this the beginning of the end?\n\nJonathan M. Gitlin - 5/3/2024, 1:33 PM\n\nEnlarge\n\nAurich Lawson | Getty Images | Beata Zawrzel\n\n#### reader comments\n\n520\n\nNo car company in recent years has been able to generate more news headlines\nthan Tesla. Its original founders were among the very first to realize that\nlithium-ion laptop cells were just about good enough to power a car, assuming\nyou put enough of them in a pack, and with critical funding from current CEO\nElon Musk, the company was able to kick-start an electric vehicle revolution.\nBut those headlines of late have been painting a picture of a company in\nchaos. Sales are down, the cars are barely profitable, and now the CEO is\nculling vast swaths of the company. Just what is going on?\n\n## Tesla had some good times\n\nAlways erratic, Musk's leadership has nevertheless seen the company sell\nelectric cars in volume, profitably. What's more, Musk has at times been able\nto inspire faith in and devotion to his company's products in a way that makes\nthe late Steve Jobs look like a neophyte\u2014after the Model 3 debuted in 2016,\n450,000 people gave $1,000 deposits to Tesla for a product that wouldn't go\ninto production for at least 18 months.\n\nOf course, that example also illustrates a long-running concern with the\ncompany and Musk's investment-attracting pitches: overhyping and\nunderdelivering. By 2018, more than one in five reservation holders wanted a\nrefund after cheaper models were delayed and delayed.\n\nBut things have been on a bit of a downward slide recently. After having the\nlong-range EV market almost to itself for some years, there's now stiff\ncompetition from car companies in the US, Europe, and China. That has caused\nTesla to engage in a prolonged series of price cuts that have seen the\ncompany's profit margin\u2014once the envy of the industry\u2014reduced to a measly 5.5\npercent. (The average automaker profit margin last year was 8.9 percent.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla has tried to stave off that decline by making its cars cheaper to build.\nWhere possible, the company has stripped content from cars to reduce the cost\nof putting them together. Some of that is merely annoying to the driver; turn\nsignals that were stalks are now capacitive buttons on the steering wheel.\nSome is more serious. Tesla has abandoned the radar and ultrasonic sensors\nthat everyone else trying to build partially automated cars, let alone fully\nautonomous ones, think are necessary. Instead, the company is relying on\noptical cameras alone. And that has caught up with it\u2014both of Tesla's driver\nassists have been the subject of recalls after numerous crashes and at least\n13 deaths.\n\n## It feels like the company just crashed into a parked fire truck\n\nBut this week has been a weird one, even for experienced Tesla watchers. On\nMonday, Musk swung the corporate ax again, just a few weeks after laying off\nmore than 10 percent of his workforce. The executive responsible for\noverseeing the company's crown jewel\u2014the Supercharger network\u2014and all of her\n500-odd staff were shown the door. Gone, too, was the man in charge of\ndeveloping new vehicles, in addition to his team, at a time when Tesla is\nsorely in need of second-generation platforms for the Models 3 and Y.\n\nNothing has calmed down since then. \"Gigacasting\" has been a much-hyped idea\nto cut costs even further by using massive single-piece castings for the car's\nentire underbody, but according to Reuters, that idea is not happening\nanymore. (At least it will be good news for repairability since a damaged\ngigacasting will likely make a car a write-off.)\n\nTesla is also already pulling back on Supercharger sites. Inside EVs learned\nthat at least four planned sites in New York City are off, though Musk did\npost to his followers to say that Tesla will still grow the network \"at a\nslower pace\" and with more focus on uptime.\n\nThe company has now parted ways with its head of HR, and insiders say that\nsome of the layoffs \"have nothing to do with hiring inefficiencies or\nrestructuring but rather with Musk throwing his weight around Tesla,\"\naccording to Electrek.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n520\n\nJonathan M.

Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
