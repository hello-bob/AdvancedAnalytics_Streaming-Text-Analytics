The public-private arrangement has allowed corporate lobbying\ndisguised as policy recommendations to reach the highest branches of the\nDefense Department, according to an exclusive report from the Quincy Institute\nfor Responsible Statecraft shared with us.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2021, more than 315 military officers with elite ranks as high as\ncolonel and rear admiral have been placed at top weapons manufacturers such as\nBoeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin, as well as other companies with\nbillion-dollar government contracts. The arrangement has also coincided with a\ndramatic rise in Defense Department spending on private contractors valued in\nthe trillions of dollars.\n\nThe arrangement, called the Secretary of Defense Executive Fellows (SDEF)\nprogram, sends officers with promising military careers to work for top\ncorporations in the defense, tech, finance, and other industries for one year.\nThese fellows then report on how the Defense Department could incorporate some\nof these companies\u2019 business practices and policies. The program has helped\nplace corporate interests at the very heart of US military strategy.\n\nThe report from Quincy Institute, a nonprofit think tank, is the first\ndetailed examination of the SDEF program. The report casts doubt on the\nintegrity of the fellowship program, calling it a \u201cde facto lobbying tool\u201d for\nprivate companies and a \u201ctaxpayer-funded revolving door\u201d where more than 40\npercent of the fellows have gone on to work for government contractors at some\npoint in their postmilitary careers.\n\n\u201cDecades of SDEF recommendations have consistently focused on reforms that\nwould both benefit corporations and bolster their influence over the [Defense\nDepartment],\u201d the report found.\n\nNearly a third of the fellows were assigned to the top fifty government\ncontractors, and 15 percent went to work for Boeing, General Dynamics,\nLockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon \u2014 the top five military\ncontractors. These five defense companies spent more than $830 million\nlobbying the Defense Department and other federal entities during the same\nyears they had fellows, regulatory filings show.\n\nAt the end of their program, the fellows detail their experience and, at\ntimes, promote core company talking points in front of some of the highest-\nranking officials in the military, including vice chiefs of staff. The\narrangement represents \u201can unbelievable opportunity\u201d for Pentagon contractors,\nBenjamin Freeman, one of the authors of the Quincy Institute report, told us.\n\n\u201cLobbyists would salivate over the opportunity to provide a briefing to\n[Defense Department] leadership at that level,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is better\nlobbying than any money could buy for these companies. When it\u2019s somebody\nwho\u2019s a military officer coming back to the [Defense Department] and saying\nthose same talking points, people are going to take that up much more than\nthey would if these kinds of words are coming from a lobbyist.\u201d\n\n\"Decades of SDEF recommendations have repeatedly urged the Defense Department\nto outsource services to private contractors, which has coincided with a\ndramatic rise in Pentagon spending.\"\n\nDecades of fellow recommendations have repeatedly urged the Defense Department\nto outsource services to private contractors, which has coincided with a\ndramatic rise in Pentagon spending. Since 2001, the Pentagon has spent more\nthan $14 trillion, with up to half of that going to private contractors,\naccording to a 2021 report from the Watson Institute at Brown University.\n\nIn roughly that same time period, nearly one million people have been killed \u2014\nincluding roughly 432,000 civilians and 7,053 US military members \u2014 due to US\nmilitary interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other countries.\n\nThe SDEF program represents a stunning example of how intertwined the Defense\nDepartment and private defense contractors are and how the Defense Department\nhas come to embrace the military-industrial complex, said Brett Heinz, lead\nauthor of the report.\n\n\u201cYou have both an immense military and an immense arms industry, and not only\nis it a business relationship, it\u2019s closer than that, it\u2019s the arms industry\ninfluencing the military\u2019s operations itself,\u201d Heinz told us. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing\nthese two entities together in such a way that blurs the lines between what\npublic interest is and what private interest is.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Quincy Institute report, there is no publicly available data\non how much the Pentagon spends on the fellowship program.\n\nThe Defense Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n# \u201cOutsource Everything Not Core to DoD\u201d\n\nWilliam J. Perry, who served as secretary of defense under President Bill\nClinton, and James Roche, Air Force secretary under President George W. Bush,\nhelped launch the SDEF program in 1995 as \u201ca long-term investment in\ntransforming our forces and capabilities,\u201d the Defense Department says on its\nwebsite.\n\nPerry said that the military needed to \u201cbuild a cadre of officers who\nunderstand not only the profession of arms, but also the . . . revolutionary\nchanges in information and related technologies,\u201d the report found.\n\nIn 2004, Roche resigned from his role as Air Force secretary amid a government\ninvestigation that found he improperly used his position to help a colleague\nobtain a job at his former employer, Northrop Grumman, a weapons manufacturer\nthat works with the Pentagon.\n\nThe fellowship program grew from just five fellows in its inaugural 1995\ncohort to about nineteen in 2021, according to the Quincy report. Each branch\nof the military is represented in the program, and fellows have included\ncolonels, lieutenant colonels, and rear admirals \u2014 ranks that often require\ntwenty-plus years of service to achieve.\n\n\"Each branch of the military is represented in the SDEF program, and fellows\nhave included colonels, lieutenant colonels, and rear admirals.\"\n\nAt the end of their yearlong program, fellows issue written reports for\nacademic credit and give presentations to top Defense Department officials on\nsome of the key takeaways during their time with the companies. These written\nreports and presentations serve as both policy recommendations for the Defense\nDepartment and a subtle lobbying tool for the companies the fellows have\nworked at.\n\n\u201cIt is undeniable that many of these recommendations would provide clear\nfinancial benefits to the host companies that they originate from, sometimes\nin shockingly bold ways,\u201d the Quincy Institute report states.\n\nAccording to the Quincy report, one of the most common recommendations for the\nDefense Department is to outsource the department\u2019s essential functions. An\nearly cohort recommended that the Defense Department should \u201coutsource\neverything not core to DoD [the Defense Department].\u201d Other cohorts have\nrecommended that information technology, medical services, research and\ndesign, finance and accounting, and personnel administration should all be\noutsourced.\n\nThe fellowship\u2019s 2013 cohort recommended repealing a Defense Department rule\nthat prevents the agency from spending more than 50 percent of its military\ndepot maintenance budget on contractors. Boeing and Lockheed Martin both\nsponsored fellows in the cohort and both lobbied the Defense Department and\nother federal entities in 2013 on depot policy and maintenance issues,\nlobbying disclosures show.\n\nDefense Department contractors receive roughly half of the agency\u2019s budget to\nprovide various services and products ranging from weapons manufacturing to\ndata storage, and yet fellows in the program routinely reported to leadership\nthat contractors needed more funds, the report found. Fellows from cohorts in\nthe mid-2010s said that Defense Department contracts were \u201cdriving industry\naway\u201d due to low profit margins and that the Defense Department should \u201cview\nprofit as necessary . . . to create a win-win,\u201d the Quincy Institute report\nfound.\n\nOther fellows have recommended that the Defense Department do more business\nwith the companies they worked for \u2014 such as the health care giant CVS Health,\nthe mining and construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, and the\nrailroad conglomerate Norfolk Southern.\n\n\u201cThe case for this program is that these are the future leaders of the\nmilitary,\u201d said Freeman at the Quincy Institute. \u201cThat this could really be a\njumping board for them, [but] we found a different story.\u201d\n\n# Weapons Manufacturers Reap the Benefits\n\nWeapons manufacturers have been the program\u2019s top beneficiaries, with the\nlargest military contractors \u2014 Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin,\nNorthrop Grumman, and Raytheon \u2014 receiving more than forty-five fellows\nthroughout the years.\n\nWeapons manufacturers have spent more than $2.5 billion on lobbying since 2001\nand, in the last half decade, have hired roughly seven hundred lobbyists per\nyear to urge federal lawmakers, agencies, and regulators to enact their\npreferred policies, according to a study from Brown University.\n\n\"Weapons manufacturers have spent more than $2.5 billion on lobbying since\n2001.\"\n\nThe Brown University researchers found that the Defense Department has spent\nmore than $14 trillion since the US invasion of Afghanistan and warned that\n\u201cexaggerated estimates of the military challenges posed by China have become\nthe new rationale of choice in arguments for keeping the Pentagon budget at\nhistorically high levels.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, a 2023 Government Accountability Office investigation found that\nthe Defense Department lacks reliable data and accounting systems to identify\n\u201cefficiencies and potential cost savings among service requirements on\ncontracts totaling billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nSome program fellows have advocated for the Defense Department, Congress, and\nother agencies to ease restrictions on international weapons sales. A 2012\nNorthrop Grumman fellow and later a 2018 Lockheed Martin fellow recommended\nthat the Defense Department consider revising the International Traffic in\nArms Regulations, which governs the sales and export of military equipment to\nforeign countries. Lockheed Martin lobbied Congress on International Traffic\nin Arms regulations in 2008, according to lobbying data.\n\nOther weapons manufacturers \u2014 including Raytheon and Textron Systems \u2014 that\nhave sponsored fellows have also lobbied the Defense Department and Congress\non foreign military sales policies, disclosures show.\n\nThe Quincy Institute report found that the \u201cmost self-serving company\u201d seeking\nto loosen arms sales restrictions was the European Aeronautic Defence and\nSpace Company, now known as Airbus. Airbus\u2019s 2010 fellow urged the Defense\nDepartment to work with Congress and the State Department to ease foreign\nmilitary sales restrictions and modify the \u201ccriteria for which export licenses\nare required,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe following year, Airbus lobbied the Defense Department, the Air Force, the\nArmy, the Navy, Congress, and other federal agencies on \u201cForeign military\nsales,\u201d \u201cArms Export Control Act,\u201d and other issues.\n\n# Bad Ethics, Neocons, And Lawsuits\n\nThe SDEF program begins with a three-week orientation that has featured an\narray of speakers with a right-wing, neoconservative ideology, including some\nwho helped craft the disastrous foreign policy of the George W. Bush\nadministration, the report found.\n\n\"The SDEF program begins with a three-week orientation that has featured an\narray of speakers with a right-wing, neoconservative ideology.\"\n\nSteven Emerson, the infamous founder of the Investigative Project on\nTerrorism, a research nonprofit focused on \u201cradical Islamic terrorist groups\u201d\nthat allegedly placed informants in an Ohio-based Muslim advocacy group in\n2021, has spoken at the program\u2019s orientation on at least four occasions.\nDuring one of those appearances, Emerson lectured on \u201cThe Stealth Jihad:\nRadical Fundamentalism Infiltration.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo days after Emerson spoke to the 2011 SDEF orientation, neo-Nazi Anders\nBehring Breivik killed 77 people in a terrorist attack in Norway; his\nmanifesto cited Emerson twice,\u201d noted the Quincy Institute report.\n\nMany of the companies where the fellows were placed have faced legal action\nfrom the Justice Department, including for submitting false payment claims to\nthe Pentagon, a review by us found.\n\nL3Harris Technologies, a communications equipment manufacturer, agreed to pay\nnearly $22 million to resolve allegations that it \u201cknowingly submitted . . .\nfalse claims to the Department of Defense by including in contract proposals\nthe cost of certain parts twice,\u201d the Justice Department announced in 2023.\nL3Harris also paid $13 million to resolve allegations that it violated arms-\ntrafficking laws in 2021 \u2014 the same year the company sponsored two program\nfellows.\n\nLockheed Martin agreed to pay nearly $18 million to resolve multiple\nallegations that it violated federal law by submitting fraudulent government\ncontracts.\n\nPratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of weapons manufacturer Raytheon, agreed to pay\nmore than $52 million to settle allegations for selling defective jet engine\nparts.\n\n3M, a company that makes a variety of products including dental tools and\nPost-it Notes, agreed to pay $6 billion in 2023 to settle nearly 260,000\nlawsuits brought by current and former military service members claiming they\nexperienced hearing loss due to defective hearing protection 3M sold to the\nDefense Department.\n\nAdditionally, the Defense Department has sent fellows to companies at the\nheart of the 2008 financial crisis and the ongoing opioid epidemic, including\nMorgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and McKinsey & Company. Military veterans were\nparticularly hard hit by the 2008 financial crisis, and military veteran\nopioid overdose deaths increased by more than 50 percent from 2010 to 2019.\n\nThe Defense Department also sent a fellow to work with Enron as the company\nwas embroiled in an accounting scandal that eventually led to its bankruptcy\nand criminal charges for some of its executives.\n\nIn his 2001 written report, the Enron fellow noted that some of his\nrecommendations came from Enron staffers, but the Quincy report found that he\ndidn\u2019t disclose this information in his presentation to top Pentagon\nofficials.\n\nThe Quincy Institute researchers said they could only find evidence of the\nDefense Department enacting one of the policies the program\u2019s fellows have\nrecommended over the years: to expand its work with private contractors.\n\nTo address their concerns about the SDEF program, the Quincy Institute\nresearchers recommend that the Defense Department consider postemployment\nrestrictions for fellows that would prevent them from working for the same\ncompanies they were assigned to.\n\nThe authors told us that such a rule would help prevent the revolving door\nbetween public institutions and private companies, which has allowed nearly\nhalf of the program\u2019s fellows to go on to work for government contractors.\n\n\u201c[The SDEF program] has become a reliable method for corporations to disguise\nself-interested policy aspirations as helpful recommendations for [the Defense\nDepartment],\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIf this program is to continue, [the\nDefense Department] must act forcefully to address and minimize the unsettling\nconflicts of interest embedded within [the program].\u201d\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota\u2019s investigative journalism project, the\nLever, here.\n\n#### Share this article\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\n#### Contributors\n\nFreddy Brewster is a freelance reporter and has been published in the Los\nAngeles Times, NBC News, CalMatters, the Lost Coast Outpost, and other outlets\nacross California.\n\n#### Filed Under\n\n  * United States\n\n  * State\n  * War and Imperialism\n\n  * Military Industrial Complex\n  * Defense Contractors\n  * US Military\n  * Department of Defense\n\n# Sign up for our mailing list\n\nAlready on our list?
