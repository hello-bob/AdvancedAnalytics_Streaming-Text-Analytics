With the recent re-popularization of Norse mythology and the resulting\ncreative license the entertainment industry is taking with his character, that\nmisunderstanding has been especially amplified. So I think it\u2019s time for some\nsource-material grounding.\n\nIt\u2019s important to me to present Norse mythology through a lens that portrays\nancient viewpoints as accurately as I can. But, at the same time, I recognize\nthat a lot of people have incorporated Norse characters and themes into their\nown spirituality in modern times and I have no interest in trying to\ninvalidate any spiritual connections people have made to this material. That\nsaid, if we want to understand Loki in the way the original storytellers and\ntheir primary audiences would have, then we must view him through their\ncultural lens and not our own. In this post I will be discussing ancient ideas\nas they were preserved, with no desire to influence anyone\u2019s personal beliefs.\n\nThanks for reading Norse Mythology & Germanic Lore!

It is usually translated as\n\u201cunmanliness\u201d, although this translation fails to embody the real potency of\nthe word, as well as the fact that it could be directed toward both men and\nwomen. From the contexts in which it\u02bcs used, we learn that a man might have\nbeen accused of ergi for reasons of cowardice, any behavior considered\nfeminine, and very specifically, taking the receiving role in male-male sexual\nintercourse.\n\nOne example illustrating the treatment ergi in the Norse period can be found\nin Kr\u00f3ka-Refs saga, which relates the tale of a Greelandic settler from\nIceland named Ref. In the tale, Ref is slandered by another man named Thorgils\nand his four sons who take it upon themselves to brand Ref with the nickname\nRefr inn ragi (Ref the Unmanly, using the metathesized form ragr). The sons\naccuse Ref of the unforgivably cowardly act of running away from a polar bear,\nwhile Thorgils himself claims that Ref \u201cwas a woman every ninth night and\nneeded in those times a man\u201d (var hann kona ina n\u00edundu hverju n\u00f3tt ok \u00feurfti\n\u00fe\u00e1 karlmanns). Ref is only able to reclaim his good reputation by killing\nThorgils and all four of his sons, after which people judged that Ref had\neffectively recovered from the accusations.\n\nAs Str\u00f6m relates2 in one of the preeminent papers written on this topic:\n\n> The society reflected in Old Norse literature possessed a hierarchy of\n> values in which personal reputation or social prestige \u2014 what with a\n> positively loaded word can be called honour \u2014 occupied the top of the\n> ethical scale. According to this standard, honour could only be won,\n> maintained and defended with the primary masculine virtue of unbounded\n> courage that despised danger and death. The idealized system of norms is\n> marked by a masculine, not to say a militant set of values.\n>\n> In sharp contrast to honour we have its opposite, the shame of not having\n> fulfilled the primary requirement of manly conduct. Lack of courage, patent\n> physical cowardice, implied such a flagrant deviation from what convention\n> demanded that it could be branded as a symptom of perversion \u2013 of an\n> abnormal, that is to say feminine nature. The emphasis here should be placed\n> on the word branded. As a rule the formulaic expressions (\u2018woman every ninth\n> night\u2019 and similar clich\u00e9s) point to established symbols and current\n> phraseology rather than to a genuine belief in the female sexual role of the\n> accused3. The symbols and phrases were intended to strike a man where he was\n> most vulnerable.\n\nThere is a particular English word beginning with the letter \u201cf\u201d and ending\nwith the letter \u201ct\u201d that polite society tends to avoid at all costs as of\n2023. It serves as a slur directed at people who do not conform to traditional\nsex/gender roles and is generally considered one of the worst words a person\ncan use, thus I have not written it here in full. I am also old enough to\nremember an earlier time when this word was in frequent, if not constant use\nin American suburbia. Although it is an overtly sexually charged slur, it was\noften leveled at boys during my childhood for all types of \u201cunmanly\u201d behavior.\nFor example, if a boy was challenged to a fight and opted not to engage, his\nchallenger might hurl this slur at him as a consequence, hoping to goad him\ninto participating, lest other boys might actually consider him such an\nf-word.\n\nWhen considering both the meaning and the harsh potency of ergi and its\nvarious forms, this f-word is probably our closest English comparison, though\nthat comparison is not perfect. In Norse society it was clearly far more\nacceptable to utter the word ergi, which had far greater ability to destroy\nsomeone\u2019s reputation, which itself had far more serious real-world\nconsequences, thus making it far less acceptable to allow the slur to go\nunavenged by the slurred individual. Also worth noting is the fact that Norse\nmanly attitudes do not perfectly mirror traditional modern, western manly\nattitudes.\n\nOne particularly fascinating near-synonym for ergi in surviving literature is\nthe idea of a sei\u00f0ma\u00f0r \u2013 a man who was considered argr for performing a\nfeminine brand of magic called sei\u00f0r (which I will anglicize here as \u201cseid\u201d)\ninvolving divination and probably manipulation of other people. The practice\nof seid was not socially acceptable for men4 and typically turned any such man\ninto the object of contempt. Skjern Runestone 25, for instance, incorporates\nthe concept of the seid-man as an insult/curse for anyone who might come along\nand damage the stone:\n\n> \u16cb\u16c1\u16a6\u16c1 : \u16cb\u16c5 : \u16d8\u16ad\u16be\u16b1 : \u16c1\u16cb : \u16a6\u16a2\u16cb\u16c1 : \u16b4\u16a2\u16d2\u16da : \u16a2\u16d2 : \u16d2\u16c1\u16b1\u16a2\u16cf\u16c1\n>\n> Si\u00fei sa mannr \u00e6s \u00fe\u00f8si kumbl of briuti.\n>\n> A seid(-man) be the man who breaks this monument.\n\nA similar pattern is repeated on the Saleby stone6 which names anyone who\nmight break the stone as argri konu (an argr woman). It is unlikely that those\nwho raised the stone believed that any future vandal would surely be a\nbiological female, yet the word woman is used as a preemptive insult for\nanyone who might have nefarious intent.\n\nAs Kr\u00f3ka-Refs saga illustrates, being called argr/ragr was serious enough that\na Norse man was legally allowed to kill a person who had insulted him in this\nway, and we see this repeated in the Icelandic Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s law code7 for example\n(parentheticals are my own):\n\n> There are three words\u2014should exchanges between people ever reach such dire\n> limits\u2014which all have full outlawry as the penalty; if a man calls another\n> ragr, stro\u00f0inn or sor\u00f0inn (both roughly meaning \u201csodomized\u201d8). As they are\n> to be prosecuted like other fullr\u00e9ttisor\u00f09 and, what is more, a man has the\n> right to kill in retaliation for these three words. He has the right to kill\n> in retaliation on their account over the same period as he has the right to\n> kill on account of women, in both cases up the next General Assembly. The\n> man who utters these words falls with forfeit immunity at the hands of\n> anyone who accompanies the man about whom they were uttered to the place of\n> their encounter.\n\nQuite simply, slandering a man\u02bcs conformity to manliness, especially implying\nthat he ever received penetrative sex, was so serious in Norse society that,\nunder the right circumstances, he would be both allowed and expected to kill\nyou for it.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to societies that have historically incorporated\nacceptable non-binary gender roles. For instance, Navajo (natively called\nDin\u00e9) society has historically conceptualized four genders, including\nmasculine females and feminine males, both called n\u00e1dleehi10. There are\nrespected positions in society that can only be held by people in these roles,\nboth roles are relatively gender-fluid, and sex between two people of any two\ndifferent genders historically carried no stigma, regardless of their\nbiological sex.\n\nIdeas about sex and gender varied widely among ancient societies, however in\nsurviving Norse literature, we find nothing like the Din\u00e9 concept. There is no\nword for a person occupying a socially-accepted, non-binary gender role, and\nindeed no word for any such role. What we find instead are men, women, and\ntheir respective, rigid expectations. When men behave in an unmanly way, it is\nextremely shameful. They are mocked and insulted, become the object of curses,\nand can often only reclaim their reputation by publicly killing their accuser.\n\nHumans, of course, are humans, regardless of the society they are born into.\nSome will feel disconnected from their prescribed gender roles. Some will\nexperience same-sex attraction. So when we find literary or archaeological\nevidence of a person who didn\u2019t conform to their society\u02bcs gender roles, it is\nhardly revelatory. It should be expected literally everywhere. But it\ncertainly does not imply that any ancient society was progressive in their\ntreatment of gender or sexuality from a twenty-first century perspective.\n\nWhen it comes to mythical characters such as Loki, correctly understanding the\ntreatment of gender and sexuality from the point-of-view of the people who\nauthored the myths is necessary for understanding the intended nature of these\ncharacters, and how they would have been understood by their original\naudience.\n\nSo in the interest of gaining this type of understanding, let\u02bcs start by\ntalking about Thor.\n\n##\n\nThor Breaks a Taboo\n\nIn the poem \u00derymskvi\u00f0a, Thor\u02bcs hammer is stolen by the jotun Thrym who demands\nmarriage to Freyja as trade for returning it. Thor\u02bcs immediate solution is to\ntrade Freyja for the hammer, but Freyja balks at this idea. A council of the\ngods is held, and Heimdall, who \u201cknew the future well like other Vanir\u201d (st.\n15) suggests dressing Thor up in full bridal attire and sending him to the\nwedding as though he were Freyja. Thor immediately protests this, claiming\nthat \u201cthe gods will call me argr\u201d (st. 17: mik munu \u00c6sir argan kalla) if he\nallows himself to be dressed up like a bride.\n\nThor represents the epitome of the Norse manliness ideal and doesn\u2019t want his\nreputation sullied. However, Loki reminds him that if the hammer is not\nrecovered, the jotuns will overrun Asgard. Realizing that Loki is correct, and\nin his role as the protector of the gods, Thor concedes to the plan. The gods\nthen dress Thor as a bride, with Loki volunteering to take on the role of\nThor\u02bcs handmaid. Together they fool Thrym and recover the hammer, which Thor\nthen uses to kill all the jotuns in attendance at the wedding.\n\nI relate this story here in order to illustrate the point that Thor, one of\nthe manliest of Norse men, is attested as having violated a serious gender-\nrelated taboo in service of a functional goal that was contextually considered\nmore important than avoidance of the taboo. Note that there was only a handful\nof scenarios in Norse society granting a woman legal grounds to divorce her\nhusband, with cross-dressing being among them11. Under normal circumstances,\nthis would have been an extremely serious social offense.\n\nThis is an important point to remember when considering Loki\u02bcs motivations for\nhis own behaviors. We need context to help us understand why decisions are\nmade before we start applying labels to the characters making them.\n\nThe context in \u00derymskvi\u00f0a, of course, is that Asgard is on the line as long as\nthe hammer Mjollnir remains in the hands of the jotuns. That\u02bcs a problem for\nboth Thor and Loki, as well as all the rest of the \u00c6sir, and the preservation\nof the world as a whole.\n\nBeing a shapeshifter, Loki takes the form of an actual woman in this poem, as\nopposed to simply donning a handmaid\u02bcs attire. In light of our discussion up\nto this point, we should understand how the original audience of the poem was\nintended to react to this behavior. Thor becomes female in clothing whereas\nLoki becomes female in physicality, and it is this gender-role-nonconformity\nthat brings an air of scandalous entertainment to the tale for the ancient\nNorse.\n\nNorse poets were not afraid to play with grammatical gender poetically. To\nillustrate this idea, the composer of \u00derymskvi\u00f0a has Loki speak to Thor in\nstanza 20 saying, \u201cvit skulum aka tvau \u00ed J\u01ebtunheima\u201d12 (we two shall drive to\nJotunheim). In this phrase, vit ... tvau is conjugated such that it implies a\nmix-gendered group of two, one male and one female. This is a poetic callback\nto stanza 12 wherein Thor utters these exact same words to Freyja, when he\nintends to trade her for the hammer\u2013 \u201cwe two (Thor and Freyja, male and\nfemale) shall drive to Jotunheim\u201d. Loki\u2019s repetition of this line in st. 20 is\nclearly meant to taunt Thor by cleverly illustrating how the tables have\nturned on him as he has now taken on the role of the bride in place of Freyja.\nAssuming this context of a clever provocation (which takes place before we are\ntold Loki transforms himself into a woman), Loki appears to be referring to\nhimself as male and to Thor as female for the purposes of the gibe13.\n\nThroughout the corpus of surviving Norse mythology, Loki is referenced with\nmale pronouns nearly exclusively. There is exactly one exception to this\npattern, as we\u2019ll see later. But throughout the mythology there are no\ninstances where Loki is called by feminine pronouns in any lines of dialog,\nand no instances wherein authors switch Loki\u2019s pronouns for identity reasons.\nIn fact, the poem \u00derymskvi\u00f0a avoids using pronouns entirely when referring to\nLoki after he takes on female form. However, we shouldn\u2019t read too much into\nthis because the poem also uses very clear feminine nouns to describe him\nwhile he is in female form, for example amb\u00f3tt (an exclusively female servant)\nin stanza 26. On the other hand, Thor is still referred to by the poet as verr\n(man, st. 24) specifically while in his bridal disguise.\n\nAlthough the Norse poets were aware that they could use gender in interesting\nways poetically, it is worth noting that there are no other instances of\ngender being used in creative or unusual ways to describe Loki.\n\n##\n\nLoki as a Woman\n\nLoki, being a prolific shapeshifter, has taken the form of a human-like woman\na total of four times in surviving mythology. The first instance is in\n\u00derymskvi\u00f0a as described above, two more are recounted in the story of Baldr\u2019s\ndeath (Gylfaginning 49), and the last is recounted in the poem Lokasenna.\nSince we\u02bcve already discussed \u00derymskvi\u00f0a, let\u02bcs talk about instances two,\nthree, and four:\n\nIn the story of Baldr\u2019s death, Loki notices that Baldr seems to be invincible.\nThe gods are joyfully attacking Baldr for sport, using various types of\nweapons, and nothing seems to hurt him. Loki becomes upset about this for some\nunstated reason and resolves to learn whether Baldr has any weaknesses. He\npays a visit to Baldr\u02bcs mother, Frigg, \u201cand change[s] himself into a woman\u02bcs\nlikeness\u201d (ok br\u00e1 s\u00e9r \u00ed konu l\u00edki). Having deceived Frigg into believing that\nhe is a trusty handmaid, he is able to coax from her the information that\nBaldr can be hurt by a sprig of mistletoe.\n\nThis is instance number two. Here, Loki\u02bcs transformation into a woman serves a\nfunctional goal as it did in \u00derymskvi\u00f0a. It allows him to gain Frigg\u2019s trust\nso that he can trick her into revealing Baldr\u02bcs weakness. Because the\ntransformation is designed in service of a goal, we do not have a clear reason\nto believe this is a reflection of Loki\u2019s personal identity. That said, it\u2019s\nworth noting that, unlike Thor, Loki is clearly willing to cross these types\nof boundaries without much hesitation.\n\nLoki then brings the stated mistletoe to the place where the gods are gathered\nand tricks Baldr\u2019s brother into \u201cshooting\u201d Baldr with a mistletoe \u201cwand\u201d,\nwhich kills him. Ultimately, Hel, who has charge over the afterlife realm\nwhere Baldr ends up, agrees to let Baldr return to life if every living thing\nand inanimate material on Earth will weep for his death, and almost all of\nthem do. Unfortunately, there is one g\u00fdgr (a jotun/troll woman) found hiding\nout in a cave and \u201cshe\u201d (the female pronoun used is hana) refuses to weep for\nBaldr. At the end of the story, it is revealed that people generally believe\nthis g\u00fdgr was actually Loki, a suspicion that Loki seems to confirm in\nLokasenna stanza 28 when he claims to be the reason Baldr can not be present\nat feasts with the other gods.\n\nThis is instance number three. Here, it is unclear what purpose Loki\u2019s\ntransformation into a female character serves. Any reason we might suggest \u2014\nwhether he does this because he enjoys being female sometimes, or perhaps\nbecause he believes it will make for a more convincing disguise \u2014 is purely\nspeculative because we lack a contextual explanation. This is also the only\ninstance in our source material where a feminine pronoun is used to describe\nLoki. In this context, Snorri has not yet revealed to us that the g\u00fdgr in\nquestion is Loki. If a masculine pronoun had been used here, it would have\namounted to the grammatical equivalent of \u201cthere was a mysterious woman and he\nrefused to weep for Baldr,\u201d which would be just as grammatically incorrect in\nOld Norse as it is in Modern English. Loki\u2019s transformation into female form\nrequires a feminine pronoun grammatically in context, and it services a\nsurprise revelation at the end of the story, so we can\u2019t assume this to be a\ncase of pronoun usage for purposes of personal identity either.\n\nThe fourth and final instance of Loki\u02bcs transformation into a human-like woman\nis mentioned in stanza 23 of Lokasenna wherein Odin directly accuses him of\nbeing argr:\n\n> [...] \u00e1tta vetr vartu fyr j\u01ebr\u00f0 ne\u00f0an, k\u00fdr m\u00f3lkandi ok kona, ok hefr \u00fe\u00fa \u00fear\n> b\u01ebrn borit, ok hug\u00f0a ek \u00feat args a\u00f0al.\n>\n> Eight winters were you beneath the earth, a cow giving milk and a woman, and\n> you have there born children, and I thought that an argr way to be.\n\nThis is instance number four. Unfortunately the phrase k\u00fdr m\u00f3lkandi is\nsomewhat ambiguous here, and that ambiguity is frustrating because it\nsubstantially affects the mythological \u201ccanon\u201d of Loki\u02bcs behavior. As Schj\u00f8dt\nexplains14:\n\n> The text has k\u00fdr m\u00f3lcandi15, which is problematical since it cannot be\n> decided whether m\u00f3lcandi is to be understood as transitive (\u2018milking a cow\u02bc)\n> or intransitive (\u2018a milch cow\u02bc). In the first instance it would mean that\n> Loki performed a woman\u02bcs job, and in the second he would actually be the cow\n> himself. In either case, however, an effeminate connotation is clear.\n\nMy opinion is that k\u00fdr m\u00f3lkandi is probably intended to be intransitive here\n(i.e., a cow giving milk). The reason being, it is immediately followed by\nkona (woman) in the nominative singular, suggesting k\u00fdr (cow) might be in the\nnominative singular as well. Additionally, it provides a narrative that better\nmirrors Loki\u2019s actions in other stories, which we\u2019ll get to. It\u2019s an\nadmittedly weak clue, but it\u2019s also the only clue I could gather. Jackson\nCrawford has said outright16 that this is a verb for \u201can animal producing\nmilk, and not for a person milking a cow\u201d, but I am unable to personally\nverify that. Either way, according to Odin, Loki spent some amount of time\n\u201cbelow the earth\u201d as a woman, and also maybe in the form of a lactating cow,\nwhich, to the uninitiated, only works if the cow has become pregnant and given\nbirth.17\n\nOn that note, Odin mentions that Loki physically bore \u201cchildren\u201d (b\u01ebrn is\nplural) while \u201cthere\u201d, meaning that this is not a reference to Odin\u02bcs horse,\nSleipnir, and probably not a reference to the child(ren) he bore from eating\nthe half-burned heart in V\u01eblusp\u00e1 hin Skamma. What seems to me to fit the\ncharacter of Loki the best, given how it would nicely mirror the story of\nSleipnir\u02bcs origin and his various other animal transformations, is that Loki\ngave birth to these children while in the form of a lactating cow. In that\ncase the children themselves may also be cows, but this is just speculation\nbecause we lack necessary context. Those children, whoever they were, are\nnever mentioned again as far as we can discern.\n\nBecause Loki has been attested as having been impregnated both in animal form\nand also by supernatural means in other sources, we unfortunately can not\nassume these children must have been the result of intercourse with a man\nwhile he was in the form of a human-like woman.\n\nOf the four instances in which Loki takes the form of a woman, two of them are\nassociated with clear, functional goals and two are so briefly described that\nwe have no clear indication of why he did it. We can speculate, but we have to\nadmit that we are speculating, no matter what we say about those instances.\n\nIn response to being called argr by Odin, it\u02bcs worth noting that Loki\nimmediately fires back the exact same insult:\n\n> En \u00feik s\u00ed\u00f0a k\u00f3\u00f0u S\u00e1mseyu \u00ed, ok draptu \u00e1 v\u00e9tt sem v\u01eblur; vitka l\u00edki f\u00f3rtu\n> ver\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 yfir, ok hug\u00f0a ek \u00feat args a\u00f0al.\n>\n> But they say you practiced seid on Sams\u00f8, and struck on a drum(?) like the\n> seeresses; in the likeness of a wizard (i.e., a seid-man) you went among\n> mankind, and I thought that an argr way to be.\n\nThe word seeresses here is translated from the Old Norse v\u01eblur, and references\nthe socially-accepted role of certain female practitioners of seid magic. For\nOdin to do anything \u201clike the seeresses\u201d is decidedly unmanly. This is almost\ncertainly a reference to the story recounted in Gesta Danorum18, originally\nwritten in Latin, wherein we are told that Odin dressed himself up as a\nmedicine woman named \u201cWecha\u201d (suspiciously similar to Lokasenna\u2019s vitka\n\u201cwizard\u201d) in order to get close enough to the princess Rind to have his way\nwith her, as he has been prophesied to do. That account by Saxo Grammaticus\nagrees that Odin\u2019s use of \u201cactors\u2019 tricks and women\u2019s duties\u201d (not the assault\nitself) brings a shameful mark upon the gods\u2019 reputations. Although this post\nis not about Odin, for what it\u2019s worth, Loki is clearly not above using the\nword argr as a way to publicly shame someone else for their own unmanly\nactions.\n\nFrigg\u02bcs response in stanza 25 confirms that both Loki and Odin\u02bcs actions are\nindeed viewed as shameful, even among the \u00c6sir who seem to violate Norse\nsocial guidelines pretty frequently:\n\n> \u00d8rl\u01ebgum ykkrum skyli\u00f0 aldregi segja seggjum fr\u00e1, hvat it \u00e6sir tveir dr\u00fdg\u00f0u\u00f0\n> \u00ed \u00e1rdaga; firrisk \u00e6 forn r\u01ebk f\u00edrar.\n>\n> You two should never talk publicly about your fates19, (of) what you two\n> \u00c6sir perpetrated in early days; let people leave behind prior fates.\n\nA key word in my translation here is \u201cperpetrated\u201d. That word was carefully\nchosen as a translation for dr\u00fdg\u00f0u\u00f0, which is a word that refers to an action\nperformed \u201cmostly in a bad sense20\u201d.\n\n##\n\nLoki\u2019s Partners and Resulting Children\n\nSince the release of season 1, episode 3 of Marvel\u02bcs \u201cLoki\u201d, questions about\nthe mythical Loki\u02bcs alleged bisexuality have been popping up like wildfires\ndue to a bit of dialogue the writers included asserting that Loki has been\nwith his fair share of princesses in the past \u201cand some princes too\u201d. However,\nin surviving source material, there are actually no attestations of Loki ever\nhaving sex with a man, expressing a desire for sex with a man, or engaging in\nany kind of romantic relationship with a man (at least, not with any humanoid\nman).\n\nThe closest we get to something like this is Odin\u02bcs aforementioned accusation\nin Lokasenna about some unnamed children Loki bore, which, as we\u2019ve discussed\nand will continue to see, would force us to interpret the text in a very\nparticular way that does not mirror any other stories we have about Loki, in\norder to arrive at the conclusion that these were the result of sex with a\nman.\n\nHowever! Loki did bear children in some way during those eight winters below\nthe earth. If those children happen to be cows, we find ourselves with a theme\nthat is nicely repeated in a particularly famous story wherein Loki becomes\nimpregnated while in the form of a horse and gives birth to another horse. So\nlet\u02bcs talk about Sleipnir.\n\n###\n\nLoki as a Mare\n\nIn the story of the building of Asgard\u2019s fortification (Gylfaginning 42), soon\nafter the establishment of Midgard, a certain smi\u00f0r (smith) arrived at the\nsettlement of the gods and offered to build them a borg\n(foritfication/stronghold/wall/town) there that would be good enough to defend\nagainst various types of jotuns. Being a jotun himself, the smith demanded\npayment in the form of Freyja (surprise!) as well as the sun and the moon, and\nasserted that he would finish his work within three seasons (meaning, in this\ncontext, a year and a half).\n\nThe gods counseled about this and came back to the smith with additional\nterms. He could have the payment he wanted if he could do all the work himself\nand have it finished by the first day of summer, a feat the gods believed\nwould be impossible. The smith asked if he could at least be allowed the help\nof Svadilfari, his workhorse, and Loki advised that this would be fine, so the\nwork began. As it happened, Svadilfari was such an amazing workhorse that it\nstarted to look like the smith would finish on time after all.\n\nThe gods, of course, did not want to hand Freyja, the sun, and the moon over\nto the smith. Since Loki had advised that Svadilfari should be allowed to\nparticipate in the work, this problem was determined to be Loki\u02bcs fault. Loki\nwas confronted and told that he could either find some way to fix this problem\nor be killed. Loki became hr\u00e6ddr (afraid/frightened) at this and swore an oath\nthat he would find some way to fix this problem hvat sem hann kosta\u00f0i til (at\nwhatever cost to himself).\n\nThat night, Loki transformed into a mare, sauntered out of the woods, and\nwhinnied at Svadilfari who straightaway ripped off his straps and made a\nbeeline straight for Loki, abandoning his work. The horses \u201cran all night\u201d\n(hlaupa alla n\u00f3tt) and when the smith realized he would no longer be able to\nfinish his work on time, he went \u00ed j\u01ebtunm\u00f3\u00f0 (into a jotun-rage). The gods\ncalled upon Thor to take care of the raging jotun, which he quickly did with\nhis trusty hammer. But Loki had by then had \u201csuch conduct\u201d with Svadilfari\nthat some time later he gave birth to a gray foal with eight legs: the best\nhorse among gods and men, Odin\u2019s steed Sleipnir.\n\nWe learn more about Sleipnir in various other stories and sagas. But we don\u02bct\nhave any information on how quickly Loki gifted him to Odin after giving\nbirth, or about whether Loki had any affection for Sleipnir or played any part\nin raising him.21\n\nWhat we do have is Snorri Sturluson\u02bcs narrative detail that Loki had resigned\nhimself to the idea that solving the Svadilfari problem would likely come at\nsome \u201ccost to himself,\u201d and that he preferred this to being put to death.\nUnfortunately, the only detailed version of this story we have is related by\nSnorri in prose, rather than as a quote of source poetry.\n\nIf we take Snorri at his word (which is the only word we have), the story of\nSleipnir\u02bcs birth provides another instance wherein the contextual motivations\ngiven for Loki\u02bcs taboo conduct show that there is more to the story than\nsomething as simple as gender-fluidity or non-binary sexuality (which, to be\nhonest, are both sort of insulting to infer from sex with a horse in the first\nplace, so I\u02bcm not sure why people do that so frequently).\n\nIf we want a clue as to how Norse society viewed Loki\u02bcs behavior in this poem,\nwe can take a look at the Gulathing law code22 from medieval Norway (emphasis\nadded):\n\n> These are the [kinds of] insulting remarks that call for full atonement. The\n> first is when a man says of another that he has given birth to a child. The\n> second is when he says that the man has been used as a woman. The third is\n> when he likens him to a mare or calls him a slut or a whore or likens him to\n> any kind of female beast. For these [remarks] he shall pay the man full\n> atonement; but the man may also seek satisfaction in blood and outlawry for\n> the sayings that I have now enumerated, if he has asked witnesses to take\n> note of them.\n\nIt\u02bcs interesting that the comparison to a mare is called out explicitly here\nalongside accusations of having given birth, since we have a surviving myth\nwherein a key plot point is that Loki becomes a mare and does exactly that. To\naccuse a man of Loki\u2019s attested behavior then (or, of course, to compare him\nto any other kind of female beast), is a dire accusation, worthy of blood\natonement.\n\n###\n\nLoki\u2019s Children With Women\n\nStrange animal children aside, Loki also has a wife, Sigyn, who is a member of\nthe \u00c6sir. With her, Loki has at least one child, though the story is a bit\ncontradictory with regard to exactly how many there are \u2013 I tend to think\nthere are two \u2013 and what their names are.\n\nLoki has also fathered three children with the jotun woman Angrboda, namely\nFenrir the wolf, Jorgumgand the World Serpent, and Hel the half-blue, half-\nskin-colored ruler of the dead.\n\nIn what is arguably the strangest account of Loki producing offspring yet,\nLoki once gave birth to at least one child after having become pregnant simply\nby eating the heart of a burned, evil woman. The entire account is extremely\nshort and exists only in the part of Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0 we call V\u01eblusp\u00e1 hin Skamma:\n\n> Loki \u00e1t af hjarta lindi brenndu, fann hann halfsvi\u00f0inn hugstein konu; var\u00f0\n> Loptr kvi\u00f0ugr af konu illri; \u00fea\u00f0an er \u00e1 foldu flag\u00f0 hvert komit.\n>\n> Loki ate a heart from burned linden-wood, he found the spirit-stone (heart)\n> half-charred; Loptr (Loki) became pregnant by the ill (evil) woman; thence\n> have come all flag\u00f0 (scary, evil, supernatural female beings) in the land.\n\nLastly, in Lokasenna stanza 40, Loki claims to have fathered a son by Tyr\u02bcs\nwife. At this point in the poem, Loki has been insulting Freyr, and Tyr makes\nthe mistake of trying to defend him. When he does, Loki replies:\n\n> \u00deegi \u00fe\u00fa, T\u00fdr, \u00feat var\u00f0 \u00feinni konu, at hon \u00e1tti m\u01ebg vi\u00f0 m\u00e9r.\n>\n> Silence yourself, Tyr, it so happened to your wife that she had a son with\n> me.\n\nUnfortunately, we don\u02bct know anything else about who Tyr\u02bcs wife is or who that\nson might be. But Loki does go on to proclaim that he will not pay Tyr\nanything in compensation for fathering a child by his wife, indicating that\nthis happened under unscrupulous circumstances.\n\nLoki therefore has perhaps nine or ten children at minimum: one by way of\nTyr\u02bcs wife, at least one by way of a half-charred heart, one by way of\nSvadilfari the horse, three by way of Angrboda, two (in my opinion23) by way\nof his own wife Sigyn, and at least two by some unknown means during those\neight winters below the earth24. No children are attested as having come from\na union between Loki as a woman and some other man.\n\n##\n\nLoki\u2019s Further Claims\n\nAt this point we\u02bcll stay focused on Lokasenna, as it contains a few more juicy\ntidbits regarding Loki\u02bcs exploits. The quick run-down of this poem is as\nfollows:\n\nA jotun named \u00c6gir prepares a great feast for the gods complete with ale that\nserves itself by the magical prowess of \u00c6gir\u2019s servants. Most of the big names\nare there, gods and elves alike, except Thor who is (as usual) somewhere in\nthe east at the time. The guests decide to start praising \u00c6gir\u2019s two servants,\nFimafeng and Eldir, for their exceptional serving abilities but Loki, in a\nrepeat of his reaction to the praise heaped upon Baldr for invincibility,\ncan\u02bct bear to tolerate this and he kills Fimafeng.\n\nThis upsets the other gods and they eject Loki from the feast. However, Loki\nreturns to the feast, intent on spoiling everybody\u02bcs good time with discord\nand contention.\n\nLoki is allowed back in to the feast and given a seat after reminding Odin of\nan oath he once swore never to partake of a drink that wasn\u2019t served to both\nLoki and himself. Having taken his seat, Loki begins hurling insults at the\nother gods/elves25, starting with Bragi, then moving on to Idunn, Gefjun,\nOdin, Frigg and Freyja (who are not the same person26), Njord, Tyr, Frey,\nByggvir, Heimdall, Skadi, Sif, and Beyla. Some of these characters insult him\nback. Others do not.\n\nFinally, Thor arrives at the feast and threatens to kill Loki if he doesn\u2019t\nstop insulting everyone. Admitting that Thor doesn\u2019t make empty threats, Loki\nends his tirade, leaves, and hides out in a waterfall in the form of a salmon.\nHe meets a torturous fate after this, but the same fate is attested as having\nbefallen him elsewhere after the death of Baldr. So I\u02bcll leave it to you to\nread further.\n\nThe interesting thing about this story for our purposes is that Loki claims\n(either directly or indirectly) to have slept with four different women over\nthe course of his insults. If we accept Crawford\u02bcs assertion27 that the word\nsenna in Lokasenna occurs early enough in the linguistic record to retain some\nsemblance of its root origin sannr (true), then we may be inclined to agree\nwith him that all the insults spoken by Loki in this poem are in fact Loki\u2019s\ntruths. However, a careful reading of the text coupled with a greater\nunderstanding of the stories referenced by Loki in his insults indicates that,\nwhile in some ways true, Loki is also doing his best to portray events in a\ntwisted context designed to make those events appear worse than they are\nportrayed elsewhere28. But regardless of how true these claims are, the fact\nthat he makes them is what\u02bcs important.\n\nI\u2019ve already mentioned that Loki claims to have fathered a son with Tyr\u2019s wife\nin this poem. But Loki also claims here to have slept with Freyja, Skadi, and\nSif. The claim about Freyja requires us to read into the subtext a little, but\nthe claims about Skadi and Sif are more direct. Starting in stanza 30, Loki\nsays to Freyja:\n\n> \u00deegi \u00fe\u00fa, Freyja, \u00feik kann ek fullg\u01ebrva, er-a \u00fe\u00e9r vamma vant: \u00e1sa ok alfa, er\n> h\u00e9r inni eru, hverr hefir \u00feinn h\u00f3r verit.\n>\n> Silence yourself, Freyja, I know you full-well, you aren\u2019t for want of\n> blemishes (of behavior): of gods and elves, that are inside here, each has\n> been your (man-)whore.\n\nThe implication here is indirect, but the claim that Freyja has slept with\nevery god and elf in the room includes Loki as a part of that group. Next we\nmove on to Loki\u2019s exchange with Skadi in stanza 52:\n\n> L\u00e9ttari \u00ed m\u00e1lum vartu vi\u00f0 Laufeyjar son, \u00fe\u00e1 er \u00fe\u00fa l\u00e9tz m\u00e9r \u00e1 be\u00f0 \u00feinn bo\u00f0it;\n> getit ver\u00f0r oss sl\u00edks, ef v\u00e9r g\u01ebrva skulum telja v\u01ebmmin v\u00e1r.\n>\n> Lighter in speech were you against Laufey\u2019s son (Loki), when you let me be\n> invited to your bed; such things become told about us, if we shall openly\n> number our blemishes (of behavior).\n\nFinally we have Loki\u02bcs expos\u00e9 regarding himself and Sif, the wife of Thor, in\nstanza 54. In this bit, Sif has just offered Loki a drink and politely asked\nhim not to find fault with her, hoping to be the one person in the hall he\nchooses to leave alone. But he does not choose to leave her alone:\n\n> Ein \u00fe\u00fa v\u00e6rir, ef \u00fe\u00fa sv\u00e1 v\u00e6rir, v\u01ebr ok gr\u01ebm at veri; einn ek veit, sv\u00e1 at ek\n> vita \u00feykkjumk, h\u00f3r ok af Hl\u00f3rri\u00f0a, ok var \u00feat s\u00e1 inn l\u00e6v\u00edsi Loki.\n>\n> Alone you would be, if you would be so, wary and unwelcoming toward a man; I\n> know one (man), and I think I do know, a (man-)whore of Thor\u2019s wife, and\n> that was the crafty Loki.\n\nThroughout Lokasenna, Loki hits each god with the hardest insults he can. He\nbrings up Odin\u02bcs argr behavior, Frigg\u02bcs dead son, Tyr\u02bcs severed hand, Freyja\u02bcs\nindiscretion with her own brother, and the promiscuous behavior of several\nwomen, which tend to include his own liaisons with them. Many of these insults\nare explained in further detail in other surviving stories and the ones that\naren\u02bct are presumed to be laid out in stories that have since been lost to\nhistory.\n\nWhat are notably absent here, are any accusations of male characters having\nslept with Loki. He does not accuse any of the men of having slept with him,\neven though he shows himself willing to use ergi as an insult, and though\nvarious characters insult him with their own hard-hitters, not a single one\naccuses him of having slept with any men.\n\nThere is, of course, the potential argument to be made that Loki could have\nbeen the giving participant in some male-male sex act. There is some debate as\nto how a man in this position would have been perceived in Norse society and\nthe disparity in treatment between active and passive partners might explain\nwhy any events like this, had they taken place, aren\u02bct used against Loki as\ninsults. However, there is also no evidence in surviving literature that any\nevents like this ever took place.\n\n##\n\nIn the End...\n\nLoki is the literary invention of a culture that did not espouse modern ideas\nabout gender and sexuality. As I mentioned earlier, we are all free to\ninterpret his behavior through whatever modern lens we want, but if we want to\nunderstand him the way the Norse people understood him, and if we want to\nteach others the truth about Norse mythology as the ancient Norse bequeathed\nit, we have to view him through their lens, not our own.\n\nTo the Norse people, Loki was a canonical man who often did things they would\nhave considered shamefully unmanly. As a shapeshifter, he has been known to\ntake the form of a woman on occasion, and in two of the four instances where\nthis occurs, we are told he does so in order to accomplish a very specific\ngoal. The other two instances do not give us enough information to understand\nwhy he does it. He has also born children in strange, supernatural ways, once\nor twice having been impregnated while in the form of an animal \u2013 something he\ndidn\u2019t want to do in the case of the fortification builder story, and viewed\nas an action that came at some cost to himself, but endured in order to avoid\nbeing executed.\n\nThough he has been known to occasionally take on female form, Loki is called\nby masculine pronouns in all but one instance in the corpus where the use of a\nmasculine pronoun would have been grammatically nonsensical. However, when he\ntakes on female form, he is sometimes referred to with feminine nouns\nreferencing the physical form he has temporarily assumed in that story.\n\nIn terms of sheer numbers, Loki appears in male form vastly more often than he\ndoes in female form. He begins every story in male form, and in most stories,\nnever changes into female form at all. His moments as a female are treated in\nthe sources as a shape-shifter\u2019s deviations from his default shape, which is\noverwhelmingly portrayed and described as male.\n\nLoki also has a wife, has fathered children with her, and has fathered\nchildren naturally with two other women. On top of that, he claims to have\nslept with a handful of additional women, but is never attested to have\nclaimed, sought out, or openly desired any kind of romantic or sexual\nrelationship with a man. Though hard-hitting insults abound, no characters\nhave ever accused him of this behavior either.\n\nMost of the \u00c6sir clan and their extended membership are individuals with deep\nflaws (except maybe Thor). They\u02bcre guilty of incest, promiscuity, perversion,\ncowardice, and even having their mouths used as urinals (Lokasenna stanza 34).\nUnlike the gods of certain other religions, their behavior is not used as a\nmodel for proper living. Loki\u02bcs behavior is no exception to this rule, and\nGulathing seems to confirm that pretty strongly. His character has a strong\nassociation with ergi, but is that because the authors of his stories intended\nhim to be non-binary or non-cis-gender?\n\nThe Loki we see in our sources is a product of a particular time and place in\nScandinavia. Surely he is different in some ways from older religious concepts\nthat came together to form his character during the late Viking Age and he\nwould be somewhat more different today if ancient Norse paganism had not died\nout in the medieval period. With regard to the way Loki is portrayed in our\nsources, it isn\u2019t accurate to refer to him with any modern terminology\nregarding gender and sexuality, and to be clear, that includes words such as\nstraight and cis. In the same way that it is difficult (and arguably\ninappropriate) to describe gender in Din\u00e9 society using outsider terminology,\nour modern concepts of gender and sexual identity would have been foreign to\nNorse people, and it is thus inaccurate and unfair to project any of our\nideas, even the traditional ones, onto them.\n\nAnthropologists will tell you that if you\u2019re going to study a group of people,\nyou need to look at them through their own lens. Through the ancient Norse\nlens, using vocabulary available to ancient Norse people, Loki is a man who\nengages in argr behavior. However, no one alive today is an ancient Norse\nperson, so whatever Loki is to you is entirely up to you.\n\n1\n\nMetathesis refers to the transposition of sounds in a word. A good example in\nEnglish is the way that some people pronounce the word nuclear as \u201cnucular\u201d.\nMetathesis is particularly common in Old Norse when it comes to words with\nhigh, negative potency.\n\n2\n\nStr\u00f6m, Folke. N\u00ed\u00f0, Ergi and Old Norse Moral Attitudes. Viking Society for\nNorthern Research, 1974. pp. 19-20\n\n3\n\nTo clarify, the accusation that Ref \u201cwas a woman\u201d every ninth night is\ndesigned to highlight the idea that Ref took upon himself the female sexual\nrole on those nights when he \u201cneeded a man\u201d. The accusation may be\nmetaphorical or it may be a claim regarding physical transformation by magical\nmeans. Str\u00f6m seems to subscribe to the metaphorical interpretation, but\nwhether literal or metaphorical, the slanderous intent and resulting negative\nconsequences of the accusation are the same. Ref is a man, and therefore any\n\u201ctransformation\u201d into a woman, literal or metaphorical via sexual role-\nswitching, results in the socially destructive branding of argr.\n\n4\n\nFascinatingly, other forms of magic appear to have been entirely acceptable\nfor men to practice. The notion of magic, more broadly referred to as galdr,\nis often attested as being performed by men, especially when it involved the\ncarving and coloring of runes. See my post \u201cAncient Runes and Rune Magic.\u201d\n\n5\n\nIntroductory information at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skern_Runestone\n\n6\n\nIntroductory information at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saleby_Runestone\n\n7\n\nS\u00f8renson, Preben M.; Turville-Petre, Joan (transl.)

Normally, fullr\u00e9ttisor\u00f0 carried a\npenalty of minor outlawry in Iceland, but in this case, the words being\ndiscussed are strong enough to warrant full outlawry as is described.\nhttps://www.dhi.ac.uk/lmnl/nordicheadword/displayPage/1548\n\n10\n\nEpple, Carolyn.

The Earliest Norwegian Laws, Being the Gulathing Law and\nthe Frostathing Law. Columbia University Press. p. 143.\n\n23\n\nThere is confusion within the source material as to the names of Loki\u2019s\nchildren, as well as to whom the name V\u00e1li belongs. Certain information\ndescribes Vali as a son of Loki, but this is likely a mistake and is\ncontradicted by information asserting that Vali is the son of Odin who slay\u2019s\nBaldr\u2019s brother Hod after the mistletoe incident. This leaves us with two\nnames for Loki\u2019s children, which are sometimes portrayed unconfidently as\npotentially two different names for the same individual, Nari and/or Narfi.\nHowever, we are also told that there are two sons of Loki who are punished\nalongside him at his eventual binding, and these are likely both sons of Sigyn\nbecause these would be Loki\u2019s only legally legitimate sons.\n\n24\n\nThough, admittedly it is possible that some of these instances could overlap.\nThe children Loki bore while below the earth for eight winters, for example,\ncould be the same children he bore from eating the half-charred heart. There\nis no way to know for sure.\n\n25\n\nThe text informs us that elves are present, but does not name anyone\nspecifically as an elf.\n\n26\n\nSee my post \u201cAre Frigg and Freyja the Same Person?\u201d\n\n27\n\nSee again Crawford\u2019s video as noted above.\n\n28\n\nFor instance, Loki insults Thor by referencing the time the two of them met\nthe literal (or at least illusorily literal) giant Skrymir. As this story is\nrelated in the Prose Edda, Thor and his companions decide to rest in a cave\nduring the night but are surprised by loud thundering sounds coming from\noutside the cave. Thor positions his companions in a chamber behind him,\nplacing himself in between his companions and whatever danger may be outside.\nIn the morning, the group discovers that their cave is actually the enormous\nglove of a giant who had been snoring outside. When Loki references this event\nin Lokasenna, he describes Thor as cowering in the thumb of a glove,\nconveniently omitting the detail that he himself cowered in the thumb of the\nglove, hiding behind Thor.\n\n### Subscribe to Norse Mythology & Germanic Lore\n\nBy J.G.
