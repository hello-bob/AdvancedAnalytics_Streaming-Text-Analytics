For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).\n\nVendors 666\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data,\nsuch as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your\ndevice type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for\nexample, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\n\nExamples:\n\n  * A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.\n  * A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors 603\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.\n  * An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors 490\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n  * A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors 485\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you\nsubmit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with\nother information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (which might for example include possible\ninterests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to\npresent content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests,\nsuch as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is\neven easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).\n  * You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.\n\nVendors 216\n\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content\npersonalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other\nservices (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible\ninterests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the\norder in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to\nfind (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.\n  * You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.\n\nVendors 189\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n  * You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an \u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.\n\nVendors 704\n\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact\nwith it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g.\nreached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance,\nwhether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a\nproduct description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you\nvisit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-\nadvertising) content that is shown to you.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.\n  * You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.\n\nVendors 354\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nExamples:\n\n  * The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n  * An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors 443\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.\n  * An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.\n\nVendors 528\n\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as\nthe website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type,\nor which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to\nlimit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\n\nExamples:\n\n  * A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school\u2019s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).\n  * A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.\n\nVendors 118\n\nSpecial Purposes\n\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly\nfraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots),\nand ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be\nused to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may\nencounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with\nthem.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.\n\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to\nensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to\nfacilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1\u00b0) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2\u00b0) the server answers back (\u201chere is the article you asked for\u201d), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.\n\nFeatures\n\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined\nwith other information relating to you and originating from various sources\n(for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a\nloyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the\npurposes explained in this notice.\n\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be\nconsidered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your\nhousehold (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both\nyour phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet\nconnection on both devices).\n\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it\nautomatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address\nof your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support\nof the purposes exposed in this notice.\n\nSpecial FeaturesAccept all | Reject all\n\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500\nmetres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\n\nWith your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be\nrequested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed\nfonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes\nexplained in this notice.\n\nSee the partners we work with below.

Wicked problems\nhave many causal factors, complex interdependencies, and no ability to test\nall of the possible combinations of plausible interventions. Often, the\nproblem itself cannot be articulated in a straightforward, agreed-upon way.\nClassic examples of wicked problems include climate change, substance abuse,\ninternational relations, health care systems, education systems, and economic\nperformance. No matter how far computer science advances, some social problems\nwill remain wicked.\n\nThe latest developments in artificial intelligence represent an enormous\nadvance in computer science. Could that technological advance give bureaucrats\nthe tool they have been missing to allow them to plan a more efficient\neconomy? Many advocates of central planning seem to think so. Their line of\nthinking appears to be:\n\n  1. Chatbots have absorbed an enormous amount of data.\n  2. Large amounts of data produce knowledge.\n  3. Knowledge will enable computers to plan the economy.\n\nThese assumptions are wrong. Chatbots have been trained to speak using large\nvolumes of text, but they have not absorbed the knowledge contained in the\ntext. Even if they had, there is knowledge that is critical for economic\noperations that is not available to a central planner or a computer.\n\n## The Promise of Pattern Matching\n\nThe new chatbots are trained on an enormous amount of text. But they have not\nabsorbed this data in the sense of understanding the meaning of the text.\nInstead, they have found patterns in the data that enable them to write\ncoherent paragraphs in response to queries.\n\nLoosely speaking, there are two approaches to embedding skills and knowledge\ninto computer software. One approach is to hard-code the sort of heuristics\nthat a human being is able to articulate. In chess, this would mean explicitly\ncoding formulas that reflect how people would weigh various factors in order\nto choose a move. In loan underwriting, it would mean spelling out how an\nexperienced loan officer would regard a borrower's history of late credit-card\npayments in order to decide whether to make a new loan.\n\nThe other approach is pattern matching. In chess, that would mean giving the\ncomputer a large database of games that have been played, so that it can\nidentify and distinguish positions that tend to result in wins. When the\ncomputer then plays the game, it would select moves that create positions that\nfit a winning pattern. In loan underwriting, pattern matching would mean\nlooking at a large historic sample of approved loans to find characteristics\nthat distinguish the borrowers who subsequently repaid the money from those\nwho subsequently defaulted. It would then recommend approving loans where the\ncredit report resembles the pattern of a borrower who is likely to repay.\n\nHuman beings use both pattern matching and explicit heuristics. An experienced\nchess player will not try to calculate the advantages and disadvantages of\nevery single possible move in a position. Instead, the player will immediately\nrecognize a pattern in the position, and this will intuitively suggest a few\npossible moves. The player will then make a more careful analysis to choose\nfrom among those moves. In speed chess, a player relies more on pattern\nrecognition and less on heuristics and careful thought.\n\nIf you are on a hike, you may instinctively flinch when you see something that\nresembles the pattern of a snake. But then you will stop and reason about what\nyou see. If it is not moving, you may conclude that it is merely a stick.\n\nIn American football, the quarterback may call a play based on careful\nreasoning about what the defense is likely to do in a situation. But once the\nplay starts, the quarterback has to make instantaneous decisions based on what\nhis instinct tells him about what the defense is doing. For these decisions,\nthe quarterback is pattern matching.\n\nWe tend to pride ourselves on our ability to use heuristics and careful\nreasoning. When we examine our own thought processes, we do not think of\nourselves as mere pattern matchers. But the latest advances in computer\nscience rely heavily on pattern matching. ChatGPT has studied an enormous\ncorpus of text in order to find patterns in how words are used in relation to\none another, without having been given any instruction about what the words\nmean. Many experts, who assumed computers would have to be programmed to know\nthe meaning of words, are surprised that this pattern matching works as well\nas it does. When you type a comment or a question into ChatGPT, not only will\nit respond by putting words in proper order; the response is usually\nmeaningful, relevant, and appropriate.\n\nIt is almost mysterious how this happens. To a chatbot, a word is a mere\n\"token,\" like a tiny square of cloth with a particular color. All it knows is\nwhich squares of cloth tend to appear near each other in the patterns that are\nin its training dataset. One at a time, it places squares of cloth in a\nsequence, and when the sequence is read as words it makes sense to a human\nreader.\n\nPattern matching also works with images. You can give a computer a prompt to\ndraw an image; based on the patterns it finds, it will produce an image that\nfollows the instructions in the prompt. The same pattern-matching technique\ncan be applied to working with computer code, sounds, and video.\n\n## A Natural Language Revolution\n\nThese new tools revolutionize the way that people and computers communicate,\nbecause now computers can respond to our language. Before, we had to learn the\ncomputer's language. The first computers only understood \"machine language,\"\nconsisting of sets of zeroes and ones. An improvement was provided by\n\"assembly language.\" Beyond assembly language were \"programming languages,\"\nsuch as COBOL, FORTRAN, and BASIC.\n\nAbout 40 years ago, most of us began communicating via the \"user interface.\"\nWe learned to manipulate a cursor and click on a mouse. Later we learned to\nuse gestures on a phone.\n\nWith ChatGPT, we can communicate with a computer using \"natural language.\" We\ntype something in English, and we get a response in English. This is a\nsuperpower, and we are just starting to learn how to take advantage of it.\n\nI wanted to be able to judge essays based on how well they address differing\npoints of view. Can a computer do this for me? If I had to design, code, and\ntest a program to do so, it would take months of work. But after spending a\nfew hours experimenting with and refining prompts, I can get ChatGPT to\nperform this essay-grading task.\n\nPattern matching also lets computers respond to and mimic the emotional\ncontent of human writing. Chatbots do not merely retrieve information\u2014for that\npurpose they may actually be less reliable than a Google search. They respond\nin paragraphs, using human phrasing and tone.\n\nBecause they communicate in natural language, ChatGPT and its relatives can do\nimpersonations. Economist and public intellectual Tyler Cowen used a chatbot\nto conduct an \"interview\" with Jonathan Swift, the early 18th century\nsatirist. Prompted to impersonate Swift, the chatbot responded to questions\nfrom Cowen. For example, Cowen asked about Swift's attitude toward the Church\nof Ireland. The chatbot responded, in part: \"Ah, dear reader, it is indeed\ntrue that I, Jonathan Swift, harbored a certain degree of skepticism towards\nreligious doctrine. Yet, one must not confuse this skepticism with a lack of\nfaith or an aversion to the church altogether. Indeed, I was ordained a priest\nin the Church of Ireland, and throughout my life, I served in various\ncapacities within its structure.\n\n\"Now, you may wonder how a man of my disposition could reconcile these\nseemingly contradictory stances,\" it continued. \"The answer, I daresay, lies\nin the understanding that the church and the state must work in concert to\nmaintain order and stability within society. The Church of Ireland, as an\nestablished state church, served as an important institution that promoted\nsocial cohesion and provided moral guidance to the people.\"\n\nChatbots can impersonate celebrities, therapists, companions, and romantic\npartners. They are able to connect to us emotionally to an extent that far\nexceeds any previous computer programs. The implications of this advance may\nbe profound.\n\nA few decades ago, math teacher Jaime Escalante became famous for motivating\nteenagers in a high-poverty school to learn calculus at an Advanced Placement\nlevel. His demanding, confrontational style and striking accomplishments were\nimmortalized in a film, Stand and Deliver. Imagine being able to clone\nEscalante and put him in classrooms across the country.\n\nOr consider the problem of training a robot. Today that involves working in\ncomputer code, but within a few years we should be able to communicate with\nrobots using natural language.\n\nCustomer support calls are another area with obvious potential. All of us have\nexperienced the frustration of menu systems (\"If you are calling about , press\n1\"). Thankfully, those systems may soon be obsolete. Instead, a chatbot can\nquickly catch on to the customer's question or respond sympathetically to the\ncustomer's complaint.\n\nSome enthusiasts see chatbots becoming lifelong companions. Futurist Peter\nDiamandis has predicted that \"you'll ultimately give your personal AI\nassistant access to your phone calls, emails, conversations, cameras...every\naspect, of every moment, of your day. Our personal AIs will serve (and we may\nbecome dependent upon them) as our cognitive collaborators, our on-demand\nresearcher, our consigliere, our coaches...giving us advice on any and all\ntopics that require unbiased wisdom.\"\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen has argued similarly that within a few\nyears every child will grow up with a personal chatbot as a lifelong partner.\nYour personal chatbot would have the ability to understand your abilities and\ndesires. It would be able to motivate you, coach you, train you, and serve\nyou.\n\nIt is too early to know which of these forecasts will actually pan out and\nwhich will fail to materialize, let alone what unexpected uses will appear out\nof nowhere. This is reminiscent of the World Wide Web circa 1995, when many of\nus anticipated rapid disruptions in education or the real estate market that\nhave yet to occur. Meanwhile, nobody was predicting real-time driving\ndirections or podcasting.\n\n## Limited Knowledge\n\nChatbots use pattern matching to provide coherent, relevant responses. But\nthat does not mean that they have encyclopedic knowledge. The answers that a\nchatbot gives are not necessarily wise. They are not even necessarily true.\n\nI have written several papers on the 2008 financial crisis, in which I make a\ncase for what I believe were the most important causal factors. But when I\nasked ChatGPT to summarize my views on the crisis, it included explanations\nthat are favored by other economists but not me. That is because the chatbot\nis trained to identify word patterns without knowing what the words mean.\n\nSome knowledge is not available in any corpus of data. For example, we cannot\npredict how an innovation will play out.\n\nAs of this writing, Apple has introduced a revolutionary product it calls the\nVision Pro. No one knows exactly how this product will be used, or whether it\nwill be successful. This knowledge will emerge over time, with the market\nproviding the ultimate judgment. As economist Friedrich Hayek wrote, market\ncompetition is a discovery procedure. Even if a computer possessed all of\npresent knowledge, it could not replace this discovery procedure.\n\n## Central Planning Still Won't Work\n\nEconomic organization is a wicked problem. Your intuition might be that the\nbest approach would be for a department of experts to determine what goods and\nservices get produced and how they are distributed. This is known as central\nplanning, and it has not worked well in reality. The Soviet Union fell in part\nbecause its centrally planned economy could not keep up with the West.\n\nSome advocates of central planning have claimed that computers could provide\nthe solution. In a 2017 Financial Times article headlined \"The Big Data\nrevolution can revive the planned economy,\" columnist John Thornhill cited\nentrepreneur Jack Ma, among others, claiming that eventually a planned economy\nwill be possible. Those with this viewpoint see central planning as an\ninformation-processing problem, and computers are now capable of handling much\nmore information than are individual human beings. Might they have a point?\n\nF.A. Hayek made a compelling counterargument. In a famous paper called \"The\nUse of Knowledge in Society,\" first published in 1945, Hayek argued that some\ninformation is tacit, meaning that it will never be articulated in a form that\ncan be input to a computer. He also argued that some information is dispersed,\nmeaning that it is known only in small part to any one person. Given the\ndecentralized character of information, a market system generates prices,\nwhich in turn generate the knowledge necessary to efficiently organize an\neconomy.\n\nA central computer is not going to know how you as an individual would trade\noff between two goods. You may not be able to articulate your preferences\nyourself, until you are confronted with a choice at market prices. The\ncomputer is not going to know how consumers will respond to a new product or\nservice, and it is not going to know how a new invention might change\nproduction patterns. The trial-and-error process of markets, using prices,\nprofits, and losses, addresses these challenges.\n\nEconomists have a saying that \"all costs are opportunity costs.\" That is, the\ncost of any good is the cost of what you have to forgo in order to obtain it.\nIn other words, cost is not inherent in the nature of the good itself or how\nit is produced. It is impossible to know the cost of a good until it is traded\nin the market. If central planners do away with the market, then they will not\nhave the information needed to calculate costs and make good decisions. Forced\nto use guesswork, planners will inevitably misallocate resources.\n\nIn a market system, bad decisions result in losses for firms, forcing them to\nadapt. Without the signals provided by prices, profits, and losses, a central\nplanner's computer will not even be aware of the mistakes that it makes.\n\n## Learning From Simulations\n\nThe problem of organizing an economy is too wicked to be solved by computers,\nwhether they use pattern matching or other methods. But that does not mean\nthat advances in computer science will be of no help in improving economic\npolicy.\n\nNew software tools can be used to create complex simulations. The tools that\ngave us chatbots could be used to create thousands of synthetic economic\n\"characters.\" We could have them interact according to rules and heuristics\ndesigned to mimic various economic policies and institutions, and we could\ncompare how different economic policies affect the outcomes of these\nsimulations.\n\nAmong economists, this technique is known as \"agent-based modeling.\" So far,\nit has been of only limited value, because it is difficult to create agents\nthat vary along multiple dimensions. But it may be improved if we can use the\nlatest tools to create a richer set of economic characters than what modelers\nhave used in the past. Still, this improvement would be incremental, not\nrevolutionary. They will not permit us to hand off the resource allocation\nproblem to a central computer.\n\nThe latest techniques for using large datasets and pattern matching offer new\nand exciting capabilities. But these techniques alone will not enable us to\nsolve society's wicked problems.\n\nThis article originally appeared in print under the headline \"Wicked Problems\nRemain.\"\n\n### Latest\n\n#### Not Even Artificial Intelligence Can Make Central Planning Work\n\nArnold Kling | From the June 2024 issue\n\n#### The Case of the AI-Generated Giant Rat Penis\n\nRonald Bailey | From the June 2024 issue\n\n#### AI Regulators Are More Likely To Run Amok Than Is AI\n\nRonald Bailey | 5.3.2024 4:45 PM\n\n#### Trump Promises To Give Police 'Immunity From Prosecution'\n\nBilly Binion | 5.3.2024 4:15 PM\n\n#### The New York Case Against Trump Relies on a 'Twisty' Legal Theory That\nReeks of Desperation\n\nJacob Sullum | 5.3.2024 4:10 PM\n\n  * About\n  * Browse Topics\n  * Events\n  * Staff\n  * Jobs\n  * Donate\n  * Advertise\n  * Subscribe\n  * Contact\n  * Media\n  * Shop\n  * Amazon\n\nReason Facebook@reason on XReason InstagramReason TikTokReason YoutubeApple\nPodcastsReason on FlipboardReason RSS\n\n\u00a9 2024 Reason Foundation | Accessibility | Privacy Policy | Terms Of Use\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": false}
