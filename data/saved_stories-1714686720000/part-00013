Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Windows 11 users, watch out - you\u2019re in for an upgrade you can\u2019t ignore\nthanks to mandatory adverts\n\nNews\n\nBy Kristina Terech\n\npublished 2 days ago\n\nMicrosoft: now more persistent than your last Tinder match\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock/Prostock-studio)\n\nMicrosoft seems intent on making ads disguised as recommendations a fact of\nlife in Windows 11, and the tech giant has apparently begun testing\npromotional recommendation pages that take up your whole screen, urging users\nto install Edge and other services - similar to the page you see when you\nfirst set up your device or install Windows 11.\n\nThinking back, I recall a few times when this screen appeared on my own\nWindows 11 PC after an update, and it caught me off guard as my PC is already\nset up to my liking. Like myself, some users would be greeted with \u201cLet\u2019s\nfinish setting up your PC\u201d automatically after a Windows Update had been\ninstalled. Before this, this sort of notification might appear if you bought a\nPC and set it up for the first time, but now it looks like anyone already up\nand running could also see it.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock/Space_Cat)\n\n## A breakdown of the new notification in Windows 11\n\nThe new notification screens were spotted by Windows Latest following\nMicrosoft\u2019s monthly Patch Tuesday update in April 2024. As shown in a\nscreenshot provided in Windows Latest\u2019s report, the notification screen\nexplains that the \u2018set-up\u2019 process will involve backing up your files using\nOneDrive, restoring \u201cMicrosoft recommended settings\u201d (read: setting Edge as\nyour default browser), backing up your phone on your PC, setting up Windows\nHello, as well as getting a Microsoft 365 subscription, and turning on Phone\nLink between your phone and PC.\n\nYou are then given two options, neither of which is to opt out of the\nnotification if you\u2019re not interested. You can choose to \u201cContinue\u201d or select\n\u201cRemind me in 3 days,\u201d and the pop-ups will eventually return. Windows Latest\ntried the \u2018Continue\u2019 option, which led to a \u201cLet\u2019s customize your experience\u201d\npage which prompts users to customize their Start menu\u2019s \u2018Recommended\u2019\nsection. As shown in a provided screenshot, users would be given some control\nover the apps that appear in this section.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\nIf you decide not to make any adjustments you\u2019ll be guided to a page with the\nheading \u201cUse recommended browser settings.\u201d The top option, not by\ncoincidence, is Microsoft Edge - Windows 11\u2019s default browser. This is\naccompanied by Bing as the default search engine, which again no surprise.\nEnabling these also pins the Edge icon to the taskbar and creates a desktop\nicon (if you\u2019ve removed these). Luckily, if you\u2019re not interested in using\nMicrosoft\u2019s web browser and search engine, you can click on \u201cDon\u2019t update your\nsettings,\u201d (which sounds like you\u2019re getting left behind), and you can keep\nyour previous settings.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock/Gorodenkoff)\n\n## A closer look at Microsoft's promotional tactics\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first of Microsoft\u2019s heavy-handed attempts to get people to use\nits software and services, and not the first to be met with distaste from\nusers. As Windows Latest points out, Edge already comes preinstalled, and it\u2019s\ndifficult to remove for users running Windows 11 outside of Europe.\n\nIf you make it through all of these option screens and have any patience left,\nyou\u2019ll be met with more promotional pages for other Microsoft services, like\nthe offer to try Microsoft 365 Family with a free trial. You could forgo this\nand subscribe to Microsoft 365 Basic, which includes ad-free OneDrive and\nOutlook, along with 100GB of cloud storage. In the screenshot that Windows\nLatest includes, no prices are stated - just a \u2018Continue\u2019 button. After this\npage, users are urged to set up Microsoft\u2019s Phone Link app, which works in a\nsimilar way to Apple\u2019s AirDrop feature, and allows you to access data on a\nlinked Android phone on your PC.\n\n## Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\n\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion,\nanalysis and more from the TechRadar team.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nEach page does at least have an option to skip that particular step and finish\nthe PC setup process, but this is strange wording, because as I mentioned\nearlier when I saw the notification, and as Windows Latest stated while\ndocumenting this process, our PCs were already set up to our liking.\n\nThis has been happening in parallel with Microsoft adding ads disguised as\nrecommendations in the Start menu and experimenting with adding Xbox Game Pass\nads on the Settings page. I don\u2019t like this direction for Microsoft, and if\nit\u2019s not careful, it could end up annoying users rather than encouraging them\nto try out the software. We live in a time when people\u2019s attention spans can\nbe short, but frustrations and annoyance can live in people\u2019s minds for a\npretty long time.\n\n### YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE...\n\n  * Microsoft targets another corner of Windows 11 with \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 adverts, and we\u2019re getting a bit fed up with this\n  * Microsoft could add yet another advert into Windows 11 - and users are running out of patience\n  * Bad news, Windows 11 users: ads are coming to the Start menu, but there\u2019s something you can do about it\n\nKristina Terech\n\nComputing Writer\n\nKristina is a UK-based Computing Writer, and is interested in all things\ncomputing, software, tech, mathematics and science.
