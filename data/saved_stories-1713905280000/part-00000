But although it lacked any literal nuclear\nexplosions or dramatic political speeches, the film wrestled with one of the\nmajor social themes of our times: a kind of structural transformation in the\nvalue proposition of elite education that I think about whenever I see a new\ncampus controversy.\n\nThis is not so much the plot of the movie (no spoilers here) as the backdrop\nto it. Paul Giamatti plays Paul Hunham, a teacher at the fictional Barton\nAcademy in the 1970s. Barton is an elite boys\u2019 boarding school, but even\nthough the students are mostly very rich, the accommodations are not\nparticularly nice.\n\nPart of the ethic of this kind of school is that students live under rather\nspartan conditions, away from the comforts of their parents\u2019 posh lifestyles.\nAnd Hunham, who teaches ancient history, is a particularly strict old-school\nteacher. He maintains high standards for discipline and for learning. He\nassigns a lot of reading, expects his students to do it, and gives them bad\ngrades if they don\u2019t. He expects students who receive bad grades to suffer\nconsequences. In his understanding of himself and his job, this is the role of\nan elite educational institution: Wealthy parents hire Barton to put their\nkids through the paces, because they think that this will be good for the\nstudents in the longer term. The school is providing a service, and part of\nthe service they are providing is harshness.\n\nAccording to Hunham, at least, those are the values Barton was founded on, and\nthe values the prior headmaster who hired him believed in.\n\nBut Hunham is at odds with the new headmaster, who believes his job is to keep\nwealthy and well-connected parents happy, which means doing what they want and\nnot flunking their precious darlings. The new headmaster\u2019s approach, while not\nadmirable, does seem to be an analytically correct assessment of the market \u2014\nBarton is a private school that needs donors and paying customers. There may\nhave been a time when the donors and the customers wanted what Hunham is\noffering, but they don\u2019t anymore. And in the movie, this is connected\nthematically to a decline in the character of the American elite. One scene\nset in the Barton chapel pans across the memorials to Barton graduates who\ndied in various wars of American history, including many alumni who perished\nin the world wars. But only one Barton student died in Vietnam, a Black kid\nwho attended the school on scholarship because his mom ran the cafeteria. A\nkid, we learn, who wanted to go to college but didn\u2019t have the money, so he\nenlisted.\n\nThis is not what the movie is \u201cabout.\u201d But it\u2019s the setting, the swirling\ncross-pressures facing elite educational institutions 50 years ago.\n\nAnd I think a key to understanding contemporary education discourse is\nunderstanding how those pressures were resolved in favor of ever-more-\ncompetitive admissions, but much lower standards for conduct and academic\nperformance.\n\n####\n\nStudents don\u2019t study that much\n\nOne major upshot of this transformation is that contemporary college students\njust don\u2019t spend that much time on coursework. Unfortunately, a lot of\nattention was paid to this question during the depths of the Great Recession\nwhen young people were facing severe economic problems that sort of muddied\nthe waters. When the NYT did a \u201croom for debate\u201d forum on the subject of\nreduced study effort, for example, Anya Kamenetz\u2019s response focused on\nstudents who need to work on the side for money. But even if you look\nexclusively at full-time college students, we\u2019re talking about less than three\nhours per day on in-class and out-of-class education.\n\nThis lack of attention to academics makes a difference. In 2011, Richard Arum\nand Josipa Roksa published \u201cAcademically Adrift: Limited Learning on College\nCampuses,\u201d which made a huge splash at the time but is now rarely discussed.\nThey used data from a test called the Collegiate Learning Assessment and\nshowed that while some students learn a lot in college and have notably\nimproved academic skills, a very large minority do not. They note that the\nactual amount of learning varies substantially by college major. The way they\nbucket this, science/math majors learn the most followed by humanities/social\nscience majors, followed by engineering majors. But then health,\ncommunications, education/social work, and business students learn basically\nnothing.\n\nAgain, this came out in the context of the Great Recession, so a lot of the\ndialogue around it consisted of progressives arguing that this stuff was a\ndistraction from the problem of youth unemployment.\n\nI was inclined to agree at the time, and I think Arum and Roksa blundered with\na 2014 followup book that specifically pegged the economic struggles of then-\nyoung millennials on shortcomings in their college education rather than\nmacroeconomic circumstances. Over the past decade, as macroeconomic conditions\nhave improved, millennials have caught up. Which is just to say that Arum and\nRoksa\u2019s critics were right \u2014 this doesn\u2019t explain very much about big picture\neconomic outcomes. That being said, given the role of higher education in\nAmerican society, the portrait they paint of schools where many students don\u2019t\nlearn anything is still important. They show that lack of learning is\nassociated with lack of time spent on schoolwork, and Philip Babcock and Mindy\nMarks have shown that over the decades, students have been spending less and\nless time on studying \u2014 \u201cfull-time students allocated 40 hours per week toward\nclass and studying in 1961, whereas by 2003 they were investing about 27 hours\nper week.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot one could try to say about why that is. But one major reason to\nhit the books is to get good grades, and over time, it\u2019s become easier and\neasier to get good grades, which means there\u2019s less and less reason to be\nstudious.\n\n####\n\nWhy grades inflate\n\nWhen I was in college during Larry Summers\u2019 short-lived presidency of Harvard\nUniversity, he made a big push to try to reverse the trend toward grade\ninflation that had occurred over the previous generation. And if you zoom in\non exactly when I was in school in the early 2000s, you can see that it was\nworking. My particular cohort of students was the only one on record to\nexperience slightly declining grades.\n\nAnd I would note that Summers barely even did anything. He just said, in clear\nand forceful language, that he thought the grading had become too lax. That\nmeant professors who privately had a bit of Hunham in them felt that they\nwould be backed-up if they got a little harsher. I was enrolled in one large\nclass with a distinguished professor who pulled a few papers (including one of\nmine) out of her TA\u2019s grading stack and re-marked them lower in front of\neveryone.\n\nSummers ended up losing that job, largely over other controversies, and his\nsuccessors did not continue the effort. So the early aughts blip is just an\noddity on the chart, an exception to the rule.\n\nI think it\u2019s an important exception, though, because it shows that a reversal\nis possible.\n\nSome professors strongly agreed with Summers and started handing out harsher\ngrades as soon as they got the green light to do so from administrators. TAs\nwere happy to go along with instructions to be tougher, if that\u2019s what their\nbosses wanted. And most professors, I assume, don\u2019t have incredibly strong\nfeelings about this and just want to be roughly average, so when the behavior\nof the outliers starts to shift, the behavior of average professors shifts as\nwell. Of course, people would complain. The nascent Summers-era crackdown was\nturning A-s into B+s and B+s into Bs. That generated some whining from\nstudents, but ultimately, to restore old-school academic values, schools will\nneed to hand out Cs and Ds that put students at the risk of real negative\nconsequences, like loss of scholarships, getting kicked out of school, or\nheading into the job market looking like a real fuckup. And then you get the\nproblem that Hunham confronted: Is this what students and their parents want?\n\nAs Catherine Rampell wrote back in 2010 and 2011, it\u2019s pretty clearly the case\nthat private colleges and universities led the charge toward grade inflation,\nwith the public institutions that serve the majority of students following.\n\nBecause selection effects are such a big deal in education, the primary basis\nof competition is to attract the highest-quality applicants. And applicants\nwant, in part, a fun consumption experience. That means creating plenty of\npaths for students to take courses that are graded very generously, ones where\na lot of work may be assigned in a formal sense, but it\u2019s pretty easy to get\naway with not doing it.\n\n####\n\nNothing is inherently easy\n\nAs everyone knows, this isn\u2019t even across all classes and disciplines.\n\nIf you take a math or science class, you will get problems sets. If you can\u2019t\nanswer the problems correctly, you will get a bad grade. And depending on your\nbackground and talent, you may need to work very hard to answer the problems\ncorrectly. That being said, I like the Hunham example because it\u2019s a reminder\nthat there\u2019s nothing inherently easy about humanities subjects. You can give\nstudents in an ancient civilizations class a test that requires them to\naccurately reproduce a lot of detailed information about the Peloponnesian War\nand give them a low grade if they fail to master it.\n\nIn a traditional liberal arts education, you might expect people to learn to\nread and even compose in Greek and Latin, which seems like it would be hard. I\nhad an old-fashioned teacher in school who made us memorize poems. This is a\ngreat example of something that almost anyone can do \u2014 part of the historical\norigin of verse is that, for whatever reason, it\u2019s easier for our brains to\nremember \u2014 but that requires meaningful effort. To this day, I can recite\n\u201cSpring and Fall\u201d or \u201cThe Emperor of Ice Cream\u201d by heart, but it took a lot of\ntime and practice when I was in that class.\n\nThe way things have shaken out, though, is that STEM departments tend to have\na lot of grant money and don\u2019t particularly want to deal with annoying\nundergraduates, so they put rigorous courses on the board to weed out weaker\nstudents.\n\nHumanities departments, by contrast, have to justify their relatively meager\nbudgets in terms of student interest, which means they need to try to give the\npeople what they want, which is easy classes. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to\nbe like that. People pay to attend group exercise classes where the whole\npurpose is for the instructor to challenge the students and push them to work\nharder than they normally would. Students would learn more if they worked\nharder, and they would work harder if the grading were tougher, and \u201cI would\nlike my child to learn a lot in school\u201d isn\u2019t a particularly outlandish idea.\n\nIt just isn\u2019t the direction students and their parents have gone over the past\n50 years.\n\n####\n\nWhat are we doing here?\n\nThe idea that the declining studiousness of American undergraduates is a\nsource of profound economic problems has been, I think, pretty overwhelmingly\ndebunked by events. But I still think it\u2019s a sort of skeleton key to unlocking\na lot of campus controversies.\n\nInstitutions function better when they have clear missions. A mission helps\ndraw the line between what\u2019s important to the institution qua institution and\nwhat a person who works at the institution cares about. It also helps to\nstructure disagreements. If two people with very different ideas about what\nshould be done can at least agree on what they are trying to accomplish, that\nsets the stage for some kind of resolution. A mission is also a good way of\nmanaging diversity. People with very different backgrounds and values can find\nways to set their differences aside and cooperate toward a common goal, if\nthey have a common goal.\n\nIt seems like if there were to be a clear goal of a university\u2019s undergraduate\nprogram, it would have something to do with educating students.\n\nBut colleges seem increasingly uninterested in holding students to a high\nstandard of work. The market has decided that the customers are mostly\ninterested in peer effects and having a good time, and schools are rewarded\nmore for being good at selection than for being good at education. This leaves\nstudents with lots of downtime that they expend in various ways \u2014 I started a\nblog, Milan is going to be Opinion Editor of the Yale Daily News, Maya wrote a\nbunch of great columns for the Crimson, others get involved in noisy activism,\nand probably the most common activity is partying \u2014 and the faculty\u2019s main job\nis research. When controversy strikes, though, there isn\u2019t really an\norganizing principle of educational excellence (or even adequacy) to appeal to\nin order to help figure out what to do.\n\nAnd even if it\u2019s not an economic crisis, I do think it\u2019s regrettable. If\nnothing else, it\u2019s pretty literally a big waste of a lot of people\u2019s time and\na nontrivial amount of money.\n\nBeyond that, though, I suspect it would be healthy for society if young people\nheading off to managerial jobs were put through the intellectual paces a bit\nmore. It\u2019s obviously not a crisis that you can\u2019t count on everyone to know\nwhat the Delian League was. But there\u2019s something inherently edifying about\nworking hard and mastering a corpus of knowledge. It\u2019s the job we used to hire\nhigher education to do, and without it, we\u2019re all a bit adrift.\n\nShare\n\n234 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n14 Restacks\n\n234\n\nShare this post\n\n#### College students should study more\n\nwww.slowboring.com\n\n349\n\nShare\n\n349 Comments\n\nJohn Crespi5 hrs agoLiked by Ben KraussProfessor talking here. My particular\nbee in my bonnet that contributes to this is the required end of term teaching\nevaluations. Instead of judging quality of instruction by, say, measuring how\nmuch students learn in a class, departments judge me by how much my students\nsay they like me. It's like a baking contest where instead of tasting the\nfinished cake we ask whether the flour and eggs enjoyed the process.
