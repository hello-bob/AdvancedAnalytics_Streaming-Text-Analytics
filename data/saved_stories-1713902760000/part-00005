That was until digital images came along, followed by Google Maps,\nwhich made Widmann rich.\n\nSign up for our free newsletters.\n\nBefore the Californian Web search giant created the world\u2019s most widely-used\nonline mapping site in 2005, Widmann and his team were already collecting\nsatellite and aerial images from their office in Lucerne in central\nSwitzerland. Their goal was to create a geospatial database with which to\ndigitally map the entire world.\n\nGoogle Street Map car near Lucerne in 2014. Keystone\n\nThe idea seemed crazy at the time, but Widmann believed in it. He had\nexperience: back in the 1990s, he had started taking photographs from running\ncars to make accurate digital maps of Swiss roads. The Internet was still in\nits infancy and there were only a handful of mobile phones around, but Widmann\nsensed that screens would revolutionise the way people consulted maps.\n\nHe went even further when he founded his company Endoxon in late 2000,\ncombining images collected from all over the world with elements of\ntraditional maps to make them easily understandable for anyone. This was the\nfuture of maps, according to Widmann. He was not wrong.\n\nMap of the Swiss mountain resort of St Moritz by the Lucerne firm Endoxon.\nKeystone\n\n## Switzerland, birthplace of a visionary project\n\nSwitzerland was the perfect place to test the possibilities of this visionary\nidea, thanks to its small size and a long history of cartography.\n\n\u201cWe were the first in the world to have super-accurate maps and aerial images\nnationwide,\u201d says Widmann. The Swiss federal authorities also offered\nextremely accurate geolocation services. In the late 1990s, Swiss Post had\ndigitised all the country\u2019s addresses through a project in which Widmann was\ninvolved.\n\nThe challenge was to extract data from the images accurate enough to train\ncomputer models to recognise elements of the landscape. \u201cWe wanted to get to\nthe point where algorithms would be able to tell us \u2018Hey, here\u2019s a street,\nhere\u2019s a shop, here\u2019s a building\u2019,\u201d not just in Switzerland, but all over the\nworld, Widmann explains. To do this, his team required many expensive\ndatabases and powerful servers. It was the dawn of the hyper-ambitious and\nalmost visionary project that would later be known as Google Maps.\n\nEndoxon\u2019s mobile mapping app showed shops, restaurants and other points of\ninterest close to the users location as early as 2005, shortly before its\nacquisition by Google. SRF\n\n## Two Danes and a Swiss at the origins of Google Maps\n\nGoogle entered the equation with perfect timing. It was 2004 and the\nCalifornian company had just opened a small subsidiary in Switzerland, which\nat the time had a few dozen employees. At the time, the Web search giant was\nmaking several strategic acquisitions with the idea of creating the most\npowerful geographic service on the internet. Among them was the startup of\nDanish computer scientists Lars and Jens Rasmussen, who had launched a Web\napplication with searchable, scrollable and interactive maps.\n\nGoogle Maps image from 2005. Google\n\nGoogle wanted to integrate information normally found outside of maps, such as\nthe name and geolocation of restaurants, cinemas, shops and other venues near\nthe search point. Put in charge of this mission, the Rasmussen brothers\nrealised the potential of Endoxon and contacted Widmann. \u201cIt was an incredible\nsite... what they did was a thousand times better than anything else,\u201d Lars\nRasmussen told the BBC in 2022, admitting that Endoxon had a commercial\nadvantage over Google.\n\nThe reason Widmann\u2019s company had gone unnoticed, according to Rasmussen, was\nthat it was based in Switzerland instead of the US and it was not called\nGoogle. In 2006, Google acquired Endoxon and Widmann joined the company. He\nwould head the Maps team in Zurich for almost 15 years.\n\n## Swiss cartography: tradition over innovation\n\nWhen Endoxon was acquired, Widmann could hardly believe that Google was\nwilling to spend so much money on a small company in the Alps to build its own\nmap service. The entrepreneur says he cannot disclose the exact figure but\ntalks of several million Swiss francs. In Switzerland, no one had seen his\npotential; indeed, the fact that Widmann used aerial images to produce the\nmaps had caused him trouble.\n\n\u201cIn Switzerland we did not attract much sympathy from the federal authorities.\nThey accused us of wanting to destroy the reputation of cartography,\u201d says\nWidmann, who also recalls being taken to court.\n\nBut the entrepreneur doesn\u2019t hold a grudge. Switzerland was so proud of its\ncartographic tradition that such a reaction was quite natural, he says. Swiss\ncartographers\u2019 ability to meticulously reproduce the details of rocks and\nterrain, even in the high mountains, was renowned the world over. So much so\nthat, from the 1960s, Switzerland was called upon to produce maps of Mount\nDenali, the highest mountain in North America, as well as the Grand Canyon and\nMount Everest.\n\n>> VIDEO: Switzerland and its maps \u2013 a long history.\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\n# Video project: 06b6cc9b-2336-4019-842d-936e975ae157 with language: ENG\n\n# Share\n\nShare on FacebookFacebook\n\nShare on XX\n\nShare on LinkedinLinkedIn\n\nShare on WhatsappWhatsApp\n\nShare by e-mailMail\n\nCopy linkCopy link\n\nEmbedEmbed\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

Its founder, Henri Dufour \u2013 for whom Switzerland\u2019s highest\nmountain peak is named \u2013 played a key role in the development of modern maps,\nproducing the first detailed map of the Swiss Confederation in the mid-19th\ncentury.\n\n>> The first 1:100,000 topographic map of Switzerland, produced under the\ndirection of Henri Dufour between 1845 and 1864.\n\nExternal Content\n\nGoogle recognises the importance of this contribution and makes no secret of\nits Swiss roots.\n\nBut today it\u2019s more Google that influences swisstopo than the other way\naround, says Christoph Streit, head of cartography at swisstopo. Like Google\u2019s\nmaps, swisstopo\u2019s are increasingly focused on interactivity, integrating\ninformation such as public transport timetables.\n\n\u201cInteractive cartography did not originate in national mapping agencies, but\nin IT companies like Google or Apple,\u201d says Streit. For institutions like\nswisstopo, clicking on a map to get additional information is not the primary\ngoal; the maps and their accurate visualisation of the topography remain in\nfocus, Streit says. \u201cFor Google, on the other hand, maps are part of a\nbusiness model based on user interaction.\u201d Google users are probably less\ninterested in studying a map or a territory, says Streit, but would instead\nlike to know if a restaurant is open or whether there is a traffic jam.\n\nThis is why Google Maps works better in economically attractive urban areas\nthan in rural ones. Swisstopo, with its public mandate, produces equally high-\nquality geodata and maps for all locations, regardless of commercial interest,\nsays Streit.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to and cannot compete with Google. We offer different services\nwith different objectives,\u201d he says.\n\nScreenshot of Swisstopo map. Swisstopo\n\n## Maps serving Google\u2019s business\n\nThanks to digitisation, maps are more present in people\u2019s lives than ever\nbefore. And Google takes full advantage of this. \u201cGoogle does not consistently\nshow what exists and is of interest to users but rather what is good for its\nbusiness,\u201d and it uses people\u2019s data for this purpose, says Lorenz Hurni,\ndirector of the Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation at the federal\ntechnology institute ETH Zurich. Aerial images also make Google\u2019s maps more\nambiguous because not all geographic objects are clearly defined, for example\nwhen they are obscured by obstacles such as trees or poles, Hurni explains.\n\nGoogle is so dominant that it is almost impossible for other companies to\ncompete. This creates a monopoly-like situation, says Simon Poole of\nOpenStreetMap, considered the \u2018Wikipedia\u2019 of map data. \u201cGoogle has combined\nits dominance as a search engine and as a geographic internet service. This is\ndangerous,\u201d says Poole. The fact that Google collects so much information on\nusers and can track and record their movements makes it particularly scary,\nPoole says.\n\nWidmann is not worried that his initial project has evolved into a business\nmodel that some deem dangerous. He says he knows how much Google cares about\nuser interests and privacy. The entrepreneur is more concerned about other\nplayers in the market that are catching up fast and do not meet the same\nstandards. In his view, Google is successful because it offers a real model of\nthe world. \u201cI could no longer live without Google Maps,\u201d says the entrepreneur\nwho seems very attached to the company that changed his life. He is not alone.\n\nWidmann is now an investor. Even though he no longer works for Google, he\nstill has a nose for good ideas. He believes the challenge in the coming\ndecades will be to create super-accurate, high-resolution maps around the\nworld to be integrated into the systems of self-driving cars, he says. \u201cThis\nwill be the next big innovation.\u201d\n\nEdited by Sabrina Weiss and Veronica De Vore\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative\n\nYou can find an overview of ongoing debates with our journalists here.
