It includes recent Supreme Court decisions in trademark and\ncopyright law and a brief note about generative AI. It can be downloaded here\nin PDF and Word.\n\nThis free textbook is an introduction to intellectual property law, the set of\nprivate legal rights that allows individuals and corporations to control\nintangible creations and marks\u2014from logos to novels to drug formul\u00e6\u2014and the\nexceptions and limitations that define those rights. It focuses on the four\nforms of US federal intellectual property\u2014trademark, copyright, patent and\ntrade secrecy\u2014but many of the ideas discussed here apply far beyond those\nlegal areas and far beyond the law of the United States. The book is intended\nto be a textbook for the basic Intellectual Property class, but because it is\nan open, Creative Commons licensed coursebook, which can be freely edited,\ncopied and shared, it is also suitable for undergraduate classes, or for a\nbusiness, library studies, communications or other graduate school class. The\nlicense means that teachers can take only the chapters or excerpts they need,\nwhich can be downloaded individually, and do so at no cost. Our goal is to\nmake the book available without regard to students\u2019 ability to pay: the free\ndigital download can be found here. If a tangible copy is preferred, an 8\u201dx10\u201d\npaperback version is available for $35. We hope, though, that the flexibility\nof the digital downloads\u2014of both individual chapters and the entire book\u2014will\nbe attractive. One of the goals of the Duke Center for the Study of the Public\nDomain is to offer high quality academic research about intellectual property\nto the citizens of the world, in accessible formats, at no cost.\n\nBUY THE BOOK FREE DOWNLOAD INDIVIDUAL CHAPTERS/ OTHER FORMATS\n\nEach chapter contains a clear introduction to the field, cases and secondary\nreadings illustrating the structure and conflicts in the theory and doctrine\nof intellectual property, followed by questions to test the student\u2019s\nunderstanding. Chapters are built around a set of problems or role-playing\nexercises involving the material. The problems range from a video of the\nNapster oral argument, with students asked to take the place of the lawyers,\nto exercises counseling clients about how search engines and trademarks\ninteract, to discussions of the First Amendment\u2019s application to Digital\nRights Management or the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings on gene patents. There is\nextensive discussion of the theory, history and political economy of\nintellectual property law. This is a subject that excites widespread and\npassionate differences of opinion which\u2014at least so far\u2014do not track\nconventional political leanings at all. That makes it unique and, for us,\nuniquely fascinating as an academic endeavor. It is also something\u2014like the\nenvironment or civil rights\u2014that everyone might want to learn about, whether\nor not they are lawyers.\n\nThis edition is current as of July 15, 2021. It includes Google v. Oracle, the\nrecent Supreme Court decision on fair use in the context of software\ndevelopment, and a discussion of the CASE Act. There are also notes on recent\ndecisions in each doctrinal area and a new series of teaching aids\u2014flow charts\nand checklists which help guide the student through the material and explain\nthe process of analysis. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this edition\nwas written during the pandemic. We added a preface explaining how the last\nyear showed the human importance\u2014but also the intellectual fascination\u2014of the\nquestions this course covers.\n\nStatutory Supplement: The Center has also published an accompanying statutory\nsupplement that collects the primary sources of US Federal intellectual\nproperty law\u2014Copyright, Trademark, Patent and Trade Secret\u2014and selected\ntreaties. This edition adds provisions from the Music Modernization Act and\nMarrakesh Treaty Implementation Act to the Copyright Act, and amends the\nLanham Act to reflect two recent Supreme Court decisions. It is available as a\nfree download or low cost print purchase. Even if one chooses a different\ncasebook, simply by choosing this supplement, one can lower students\u2019 costs\nsubstantially.\n\n### About the authors\n\nJames Boyle is William Neal Reynolds Professor of Law at Duke Law School and\nthe former Chairman of the Board of Creative Commons. His other books include\nThe Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind, Shamans, Software and\nSpleens: Law and the Construction of the Information Society, countless\nwidely-cited and sparingly-read law review articles, and two educational\ngraphic novels (with Jennifer Jenkins): Bound By Law? and Theft!: A History of\nMusic. He recently edited The Past and Future of the Internet: A Symposium for\nJohn Perry Barlow and co-authored Mark of the Devil: The University as Brand\nBully, an empirical study of whether the university most often accused of\nbeing a brand-bully actually is one. Unfortunately, the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d and\nthe name of the university is \u201cDuke.\u201d\n\nJennifer Jenkins is Clinical Professor of Law (Teaching) at Duke Law School\nand the Director of the Center for the Study of the Public Domain. Her\narticles include In Ambiguous Battle: The Promise (and Pathos) of Public\nDomain Day and Last Sale? Libraries\u2019 Rights in the Digital Age. She is the co-\nauthor, with James Boyle, of Bound By Law?, Theft!: A History of Music, and\nMark of the Devil: The University as Brand Bully.\n\n### Why An Open Coursebook Project?\n\nFrom the Introduction:\n\n\u201cWhy do we do this? Partly, we do it because we think the price of legal\ncasebooks and materials is obscene. Law students, who are already facing large\ndebt burdens, are required to buy casebooks that cost $150\u2013$200, and\n\u201cstatutory supplements\u201d that consist mainly of unedited, public domain,\nFederal statutes for $40 or $50. The total textbook bill for a year can be\nover $1500. This is not a criticism of casebook authors, but rather of the\ncasebook publishing system. We know well that putting together a casebook is a\nlot of work and can represent considerable scholarship and pedagogic\ninnovation. We just put together this one and we are proud of it. But we think\nthat the cost is disproportionate and that the benefit flows\ndisproportionately to conventional legal publishers. Some of those costs might\nhave been more justifiable when we did not have mechanisms for free worldwide\nand almost costless distribution. Some might have been justifiable when we did\nnot have fast, cheap and accurate print on demand services. Now we have both.\nLegal education is already expensive; we want to play a small part in\ndiminishing the costs of the materials involved.\u201d\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions:\n\n  * So this is just about saving students money?\n  * Is this part of some kind of trend?\n  * Why have a paper version at all?\n  * What's the catch?

But no, this is not just about price. Our point is not only\nthat the current casebook is vastly too expensive, it is also awkward,\ninflexible, lacking visual stimulus, incapable of customization and hard to\npreview and search on the open web. Casebooks do not respond well to the\ndifferent needs of different professors. Students cannot easily be given free,\nsearchable digital access to all the materials, on all their devices,\nanywhere, access that does not go away when the course\u2014or the publisher\u2014ends.\nWe can do that.\n\nThere are also lots of people outside of law school, or outside this country,\nwho would like to know more about American law\u2014just as there are people\noutside of computer science who want to know about artificial intelligence.\nFree is a good price-point for them. Customizable is a good form. This book is\nmerely a beta-test version, but it is an example of what can be done.\n\nThe casebook is published under a Creative Commons Attribution, Non\nCommercial, Share-Alike license. It is available in two ways. First, the\nentire book can be downloaded for free (or download individual chapters in a\nvariety of formats). No digital rights management. No codes. No expiring\npermissions. Second, a low cost but high quality paperback version is\navailable at a reasonable price. Our goal has been to keep the price of the\ncasebook below $35\u2014which given the possibility of resale, might make it an\nenvironmentally attractive alternative to printing out chapters and then\nthrowing them away. (The companion statutory supplement is available under a\nsimilar arrangement\u2014$12.50 in print and freely downloadable.) We also hope\nboth of these options are useful for those who might want to use the books\noutside the law school setting or outside the United States. The casebook and\nthe statutory supplement will be available for a combined price of $47.50,\nwhich is $200 below the price many alternatives in those categories. Those who\ndo not want, or cannot afford, to pay that price can use the free digital\nversions.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### Is this part of some kind of trend?\n\nWe hope so. The goal of this project, and that of other ones such as the\nBerkman Center\u2019s fascinating H20 project, or eLangdell, is creatively to\nimprove the pricing and access norms of the world of legal textbook\npublishing, while offering the flexibility and possibility for customization\nthat unfettered digital access provides. We hope it will provide a pleasant,\nrestorative, competitive pressure on the commercial publishers to lower their\nprices and improve their digital access norms.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### Why have a paper version at all?\n\nWe have heard from several colleagues, both those who ban laptops in class and\nthose who do not, that an environmentally friendly alternative to printing out\nstatutes and throwing them away would be desirable, particularly one that came\nwith first sale rights and cost less than the comparable course-packet from\nthe law school's photocopying center.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### What's the catch? What kinds of DRM or licensing restrictions are there?\n\nNo DRM! The casebook is under a CC BY:NC:SA license. It requires attribution,\npermits any non commercial use and tells those who modify that they must share\nthe freedoms they were given. After that? It is free to download. Free to\ncopy. Free to modify.\n\nThe statutory supplement is under a CC: BY license, allowing unlimited\nreproduction and modification, including for commercial purposes. If you can\nundercut our commercial price on the statutes, go right ahead! We'd be\ndelighted! Of course, the underlying statutes and treaties are in the public\ndomain. You can use those without any restrictions. But if you want our\npreface, chart and editorial comments, you have at least to give attribution.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### What formats is the casebook available in?\n\nPDF, print, and many other formats (and modular versions).\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### So you are against professors who want to be paid for their work and\ntime?\n\nOn the contrary. In fact, one of the things we have learned in this process is\nhow poorly both authors and students are being treated by the current system.\nThe authors of casebooks and statutory supplements are generally\n\na.) unable to give their students digital access to the very books they have\njust written\u2014unless it is fettered by digital rights management,\n\nb.) unable to customize the material\u2014omitting unwanted chapters or statutes,\nor adding in new material on the fly,\n\nc.) and\u2014despite the obscene prices on the books\u2014given a relatively low share\nof the proceeds. All the disadvantages of profiteering with none of the\nadvantages! Personally, we chose to keep the cost as low as possible, but we\nare fully aware of the labor and creativity required to put together a\ncasebook\u2014we just created one. It does not seem unreasonable to expect a reward\nto encourage that kind of activity in the future.\n\nSuppose a professor chose to self-publish with a print-on-demand service. (We\nused CreateSpace, but there are many others.) Suppose she wanted to create an\n825 page paperback, 7 in. x 10 in. casebook of her own. (Those are the same\ndimensions as the typical statute book and about twice as many pages.) Suppose\nshe decided to price it at $60\u2014which would be $100\u2013$120 cheaper than the\ncurrent casebook she assigns. (Though those, to be fair, are both in hardcover\nand even larger.) We calculate her per book royalty would be about $25 if\nbought on Amazon, $13 if bought in a bricks and mortar store; comparable to or\nlarger than her royalty in a conventional publishing contract. Values vary,\nbut to us, saving your debt-strapped students $100 each, while getting that\ndegree of editorial control and that breadth of dissemination, seems like a\npretty good deal.\n\nWe will be honest. We want very much to tip the norm towards free, unregulated\ndigital access\u2014so the whole world and not just her class can learn from her\nmaterials. And we think $60 is high\u2014though not as bad as $160 or $200! But she\ncould require the purchase of a paper copy, which her students could resell\nwhen the class is over, while also giving her students free digital access,\nand get much wider dissemination of and impact from her ideas.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### What effect will efforts like this have on the textbook industry?\n\nWe think it alone will have zero effect. Our initiative is utterly\ninsignificant, less than a fleabite\u2014just a proof of concept. But we actually\nhope that the inexorable multiplication of projects such as these will be an\naid to those still publishing with conventional textbook publishers and\u2014long\nterm\u2014a benign influence on the textbook industry as a whole. To the casebook\nauthor trapped in contracts with an existing publishing house: remember when\nyou said you needed an argument to convince them to price your casebook and\nyour supplement more reasonably? Or an argument to convince them to give you\nmore options in making digital versions available to your students in addition\nto their print copies, but without taking away their first sale rights? Here\nis one such argument. There are many more either already out there or in the\npipeline, all offering slightly different versions of lower cost educational\nmaterial that can be freely customized. Traditional textbook publishers can\ncompete with free. But they have to try harder. We will all benefit when they\ndo.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### No one will buy if there is a free digital version. Right?\n\nWe disagree. And so do some of the empirics.\n\nRead this and then this.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### But what about a salesforce? How would that professor be able to get\nothers to adopt her book without mailing it to everyone or having insistent\nsalespeople pounding the halls?\n\nThey can read it, instantly, freely anywhere, just by downloading it! They can\nbrowse it on the exercise bike or on the train, scan through it on their\ntablet. Read it in their office. That's much more efficient. In the world we\nimagine, professors will be able instantly to browse, search within and assess\nthe pedagogical suitability of a free digital version of a casebook online.\nPerhaps this will put a merciful end to the never-ending cascade of free but\nunread casebooks in cardboard mailing boxes and charming but unwelcome\ncasebook representatives in natty business suits; the 1950's distribution\nmechanism for the casebook in the halls of the 21st century law school. That\nmechanism needs to go the way of the whale oil merchant, the typing pool and\nthe travel agent. To the extent that the \"justification\" offered for today's\nprices is that they are needed to pay for the last century's distribution\nmethods, we would have to disagree politely but emphatically.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### How long to get an actual copy of the book?\n\nWe've found it takes about 5 days. Your mileage may vary.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### Back to this book. What's in it? Can I have a review copy?\n\nDownload it and see. That's your review copy. (Or download individual chapters\nin a variety of formats.)\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n#### Even if you were to help save students some money on textbooks, legal\neducation will still be very expensive, so therefore you should do nothing.\n\nSure. Have a nice day.\n\nBack to FAQs\n\n### Center Publications\n\nTheft!
