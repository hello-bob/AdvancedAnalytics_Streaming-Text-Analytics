As the investigation\ncontinues, the FAA will take any necessary action \u2014 as always \u2014 to ensure the\nsafety of the flying public.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoeing has publicly admitted that record falsification did occur. In a note\noriginally shared internally at Boeing that was subsequently shared with\nGizmodo, one of Boeing\u2019s executives, Scott Stocker\u2014who is 787 vice president\nand general manager at one of its South Carolina assembly plants\u2014explained a\nrecent incident involving a Boeing teammate who had seen and reported\n\u201cirregularity\u201d at the plant. Stocker\u2019s statement partially reads:\n\n> The teammate saw what appeared to be an irregularity in a required\n> conformance test in wing body join. He raised it with his manager, who\n> brought it to the attention of executive leadership. I wanted to personally\n> thank and commend that teammate for doing the right thing. It\u2019s critical\n> that every one of us speak up when we see something that may not look right,\n> or that needs attention.\n>\n> After receiving the report, we quickly reviewed the matter and learned that\n> several people had been violating Company policies by not performing a\n> required test, but recording the work as having been completed. As you all\n> know, we have zero tolerance for not following processes designed to ensure\n> quality and safety. We promptly informed our regulator about what we learned\n> and are taking swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStocker added that Boeing\u2019s \u201cengineering team has assessed that this\nmisconduct did not create an immediate safety of flight issue.\u201d\n\nBoeing is currently the subject of several different federal investigations.\nThe company has been under intense scrutiny ever since January, when an Alaska\nAirlines flight lost part of its hull, purportedly as a result of a\nmanufacturing error. Regulators have raised questions about Boeing\u2019s safety\npractices, and the company has become the focus of numerous federal\ninvestigations, as well as Congressional scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company\u2019s public relations crisis has also been marred by conspiracy\ntheories as the result of the deaths of multiple corporate whistleblowers who\nhave spoken out about safety issues at the company. In March, whistleblower\nJohn Barnett, a former quality control engineer at Boeing, was found dead in a\nmotel parking lot from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Barnett was\nin the midst of giving legal testimony against the company at the time of his\ndeath. Joshua Dean, who previously worked as a quality auditor at the plane\nmanufacturer\u2019s supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, was involved in a similar legal\nbattle with Spirit when he died last week from a fast-spreading infection.\n\nA number of other whistleblowers have come out against the company, including\nthree who gave testimony in front of Congress late last month.\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nKein Scherz: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nSparkonten | Gesponserte Links\n\nRekordhohe Zinss\u00e4tze auf Sparkonten k\u00f6nnten Sie \u00fcberraschenSparkonten | Gesponserte Links|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nHydrip\n\nHandsauger: Erfindung aus Deutschland erobert gerade ganz\nDeutschlandKabelloser Handsauger f\u00fcr Zuhause, Auto, B\u00fcro - nahezu ger\u00e4uschlos!\nKurze Zeit 30% Aktion!Hydrip|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nSparkonten | Gesponserte Links\n\nDie Zinss\u00e4tze f\u00fcr Sparkonten k\u00f6nnten Sie \u00fcberraschenSparkonten | Gesponserte Links|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nSolaranlagen\n\nWas kostet eine Solaranlage mit Speicher 2024?Solarstrom lohnt sich:\nStromspeicher & staatliche F\u00f6rderung machen es m\u00f6glichSolaranlagen|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\n", "frontpage": true}
