'Alive son of Awake'; also known as\nHai Eb'n Yockdan^[1]) is an Arabic philosophical novel and an allegorical tale\nwritten by Ibn Tufail (c. 1105 \u2013 1185) in the early 12th century in Al-\nAndalus.^[2] Names by which the book is also known include the Latin:\nPhilosophus Autodidactus ('The Self-Taught Philosopher'); and English: The\nImprovement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan. \u1e24ayy\nibn Yaq\u1e93\u0101n was named after an earlier Arabic philosophical romance of the same\nname, written by Avicenna during his imprisonment in the early 11th\ncentury,^[3] even though both tales had different stories.^[4] The novel\ngreatly inspired Islamic philosophy as well as major Enlightenment\nthinkers.^[5] It is the third most translated text from Arabic, after the\nQuran and the One Thousand and One Nights.^[6]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nHayy ibn Yaqdhan, along with three poems, is all that remains of the writings\nof Ibn Tufail (c. 1105 \u2013 1185), who lived under the Almohads and served Sultan\nAbu Yaqub Yusuf.^[6] The book was influential among medieval Jewish scholars\nat the Toledo School of Translators run by Raymond de Sauvet\u00e2t, and its impact\ncan be seen in The Guide for the Perplexed of Maimonides.^[6] It was\n\"discovered\" in the West after Edward Pococke of Oxford, while visiting a\nmarket in Damascus, found a manuscript of Hayy ibn Yaqdhan made in Alexandria\nin 1303 containing commentary in Hebrew.^[6] His son, Edward Pococke Jr.\npublished a Latin translation in 1671, subtitled \"The Self-Taught\nPhilosopher.\"^[6]^[7] George Keith the Quaker translated it into English in\n1674, Baruch Spinoza called for a Dutch translation, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\nchampioned the book in German circles, and a copy of the book went to the\nSorbonne.^[6]^[7] Daniel Defoe (c. 1660 \u2013 1731), author of Robinson Crusoe,\nwas heavily influenced by the work as well as by the memoir of the Scottish\ncastaway Alexander Selkirk.^[6]\n\nIn the Muslim world, the book is an honored Sufi text.^[6]\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\nThe story revolves around \u1e24ayy ibn Yaq\u1e93\u0101n, a little boy who grew up on an\nisland in the Indies under the equator, isolated from the people, in the bosom\nof an antelope that raised him, feeding him with her milk. \u1e24ayy has just\nlearned to walk and imitates the sounds of antelopes, birds, and other animals\nin his surroundings. He learns their languages, and he learns to follow the\nactions of animals by imitating their instinct.\n\nHe makes his own shoes and clothes from the skins of animals, and studies the\nstars. He reaches a higher level of knowledge, of the finest of astrologists.\nHis continuous explorations and observation of creatures and the environment\nlead him to gain great knowledge in natural science, philosophy, and religion.\nHe concludes that, at the basis of the creation of the universe, a great\ncreator must exist. \u1e24ayy ibn Yaq\u1e93\u0101n lived a humble modest life as Sufi and\nforbade himself from eating meat.\n\nOnce 30 years old, he meets his first human, who has landed on his isolated\nIsland. By the age of 49, he is ready to teach other people about the\nknowledge he gained throughout his life.\n\n## Concepts[edit]\n\nHayy ibn Yaqdhan is an allegorical novel in which Ibn Tufail expresses\nphilosophical and mystical teachings in a symbolic language in order to\nprovide better understanding of such concepts. This novel is thus the most\nimportant work of Ibn Tufail, containing the main ideas that form his system.\n\nIbn Tufail was familiar with the differences in the ideas of Al-Ghazali and\nthose of the \"Neoplatonizing Aristotelianists\" Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina.^[8] In\nHayy ibn Yaqdhan, Ibn Tufail sought to present \"a conciliating synthesis of\nthe Islamic speculative tradition with al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b's Sufi-influenced recasting\nof Islamic mysticism and pietism.\"^[8] Ibn Tufail borrows from Ibn Sina, using\nthe title of one of his allegories and drawing inspiration from his Floating\nMan thought experiment, but transforming the subject's sensory deprivation to\nsocial isolation.^[8]\n\nWith this novel, Tufail focuses on finding solutions to the three main\nproblems discussed during his period:^[9]\n\n  1. Humans, on their own, are able to reach the level of al-Ins\u0101n al-K\u0101mil by merely observing and thinking of the nature, without any education.\n  2. The information that is obtained through observation, experiment, and reasoning, does not contradict with revelation. In other words, religion and philosophy (or science) are compatible, rather than contradictory.\n  3. Reaching the absolute information is individual and simply any human being is able to achieve that.\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\nBeyond leaving an enormous impact on Andalusi literature, Arabic literature,\nand classical Islamic philosophy, Hayy ibn Yaqdhan influenced later European\nliterature during the Age of Enlightenment, turning into a best-seller during\nthe 17th-18th centuries.^[10]^[5] The novel particularly influenced the\nphilosophies and scientific thought of vanguards of modern Western philosophy\nand the Scientific Revolution such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Christiaan\nHuygens, Isaac Newton, and Immanuel Kant.^[11] Beyond foreshadowing Molyneux's\nProblem,^[12] the novel specifically inspired John Locke's concept of tabula\nrasa as propounded in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690),^[13]\nsubsequently inspiring the philosophies of later modern empiricists, such as\nDavid Hume and George Berkeley. The novel's notion of materialism also has\nsimilarities to Karl Marx's historical materialism.^[14] The first English\ntranslation by orientalist Simon Ockley inspired the desert island narrative\nof Daniel Defoe's classic Robinson Crusoe.^[15]^[16]^[17]^[18]\n\n## Translations[edit]\n\n### English translations[edit]\n\nIn chronological order, with translators names:\n\n  * George Keith. 1674.^[7]\n  * Ockley, Simon. 1708.
