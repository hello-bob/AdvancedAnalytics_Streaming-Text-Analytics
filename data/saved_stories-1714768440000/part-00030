Especially\ngiven that today, we have new options like Ruby WASM and Opal Ruby (Fukuoka\nRuby 2023 Winner: https://opalrb.com/blog/2023/03/30/op... ), as demonstrated\nby the TryRuby Playground on Ruby's home page. Using them will achieve the\nultimate dream of being able to write Ruby code on both the frontend and\nbackend, resulting in great software engineering benefits such as better code\nmaintainability and higher productivity. That said, how do we get started with\nRuby in the browser in a Rails app? What are the trade-offs compared to using\nJavaScript? How do we make frontend Ruby talk to backend Ruby while reusing\nsome of its Ruby code? This talk will help Ruby on Rails software engineers\nget started with Ruby in the browser while providing demos along the way via\nan actual Rails app. Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/...\n\nShow less Show more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### montreal-rb\n\n153 subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\n## Comments 4\n\nTop comments\n\nNewest first\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# Intro to Ruby in the Browser by Andy Maleh (Montreal.rb Ruby Talk 2023/09)\n\nmontreal-rb\n\nmontreal-rb\n\n153 subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n1.9K views 7 months ago\n\n1,988 views \u2022 Sep 7, 2023\n\nShow less\n\nMatz mentioned in his RubyConf 2022 keynote speech that in the future of Ruby,\nmaybe we could start replacing JavaScript with Ruby in the browser.
