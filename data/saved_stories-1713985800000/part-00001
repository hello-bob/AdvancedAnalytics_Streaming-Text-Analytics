This fixation on a novel material contributed\nto the manifestation of the delusion. Edward Shorter, a historian of\npsychiatry from the University of Toronto, attributes the rise of the delusion\nin 17th century Europe to the novelty of glass material, stating that\n\"throughout history, the inventive unconscious mind has pegged its delusions\non to new materials and the technological advances of the age.\"^[3]\n\nConcentration of the glass delusion among the wealthy and educated classes\nallowed modern scholars to associate it with a wider and better described\ndisorder of melancholy.^[2]\n\n## Contemporary accounts[edit]\n\nRobert Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) touches on the subject in the\ncommentary as one of many related manifestations^[4] of the same anxiety:\n\n> Fear of devils, death, that they shall be so sick, of some such or such\n> disease, ready to tremble at every object, they shall die themselves\n> forthwith, or that some of their dear friends or near allies are certainly\n> dead; imminent danger, loss, disgrace still torment others; that they are\n> all glass, and therefore will suffer no man to come near them; that they are\n> all cork, as light as feathers; others as heavy as lead; some are afraid\n> their heads will fall off their shoulders, that they have frogs in their\n> bellies, Etc.^[5]\n\nMiguel de Cervantes based one of his short Exemplary Novels, The Glass\nGraduate (Spanish: El licenciado Vidriera, 1613), on the delusion of the title\nsubject, an aspiring young lawyer.^[6] The protagonist of the story falls into\na grave depression after being bedridden for six months subsequent to being\npoisoned with a purportedly aphrodisiac potion. He claims that, being of\nglass, his perceptions are clearer than those of men of flesh and demonstrates\nby offering witty comments. After two years of illness, Rodaja is cured by a\nmonk; no details of the cure are provided except that the monk is allegedly a\nmiracle-maker.\n\nThe Dutch poet Constantijn Huygens wrote a Costly Folly (1622) centered on a\nsubject who \"fears everything that moves in his vicinity... the chair will be\nthe death for him; he trembles at the bed, fearful that one will break his\nbum, the other smash his head\".^[2] His Dutch contemporary Caspar Barlaeus\nexperienced the glass delusion.^[7]\n\nFrench philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes wrote Meditations on First Philosophy\n(1641), using the glass delusion as an example of an insane person whose\nperceived knowledge of the world differs from the majority.^[8] In the Essay\n(Book II, Chapter XI, 13) when proposing his celebrated model of madness, John\nLocke also refers to the glass delusion.^[9]\n\nIn modern times, the glass delusion has not completely disappeared. There are\nstill isolated cases today. \"Surveys of modern psychiatric institutions have\nonly revealed two specific (uncorroborated) cases of the glass delusion.\nFoulch\u00e9-Delbosc reports finding one Glass Man in a Paris asylum, and a woman\nwho thought she was a potsherd was recorded at an asylum in Merenberg.\" Andy\nLameijn, a psychiatrist from the Netherlands, reports that he has a male\npatient suffering from the delusion in Leiden.^[10]\n\nGerman alchemist Johann Joachim Becher had a fascination with glass delusion.\nIn Physica Subterranea (1669), he wrote that he discovered a way of turning\ndead human bodies into glass. However, Becher's claim was not true. ^[11]\n\n## Historical cases[edit]\n\n### King Charles VI[edit]\n\nKing Charles VI of France was famously afflicted by the glass delusion. He\nwore clothing that was reinforced with iron rods and did not allow his\nadvisors to come near him due to his fear that his body would accidentally\n\"shatter.\" He may have been the first known case of glass delusion.^[1]\n\n### Tchaikovsky[edit]\n\nThe neurotic behavior of the 19th-century Russian composer Peter Ilyich\nTchaikovsky seems reminiscent of the glass delusion, centering as it did on\nhis difficulties caused by his belief that his head would fall off while\nconducting if he did not hold his chin. While the legend may be exaggerated,\nit seems to have some basis in fact.\n\nDuring Tchaikovsky's first attempt at conducting The Voyevoda in 1868, the\ncomposer \"had felt that his head would fall sideways unless he fought to keep\nit upright.\"^[12] He mostly avoided conducting due to this affliction,\nexpressing to his patroness \"all my life I have been tormented by awareness of\nmy inability to conduct. It has seemed to me there is something shameful and\ndisreputable in not being able to stop myself trembling with fear and horror\nat the very thought of going out in front of the public with a baton.\"^[12]\nHowever, he later overcame his fear and successfully conducted The Enchantress\nin 1887.\n\n### Princess of Bavaria[edit]\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Bavaria believed that she had swallowed a glass piano as\na child. She was convinced that the object remained inside her body from that\npoint on, fearful that it might shatter and puncture her organs.^[13]\n\n### Georgios Hatzianestis[edit]\n\nGeorgios Hatzianestis, a Greek military officer, was commander of the Army of\nAsia Minor during the Greco-Turkish War in 1922. He failed to adequately\nrespond to the Great Offensive that turned the war in the Turks' favour\nbecause he believed that his legs were made of glass and could shatter if he\nmoved. For his failure, he was tried as an anti-Venizelist in the Trial of the\nSix (the only military leader to be so prosecuted) and was executed for high\ntreason.^[14]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Charles VI of France\n  * El licenciado Vidriera\n  * Princess Alexandra of Bavaria\n  * Georgios Hatzianestis\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Speak, Gill (1990). \"An odd kind of melancholy: reflections on the glass delusion in Europe (1440\u20131680)\".
