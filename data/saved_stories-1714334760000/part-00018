The letter is dated last Thursday and it is\nsummarised as follows:\n\n> Dear Colleagues,\n>\n> The discontinuation of on-demand paper files was announced on 26 March 2024\n> during the Easter Holidays and implemented a few days later on 1 April 2024.\n> No statutory consultation in the COHSEC and the GCC took place beforehand.\n> The decision took staff by surprise without any transitional period and\n> hence was negatively perceived, especially among the non-negligible number\n> of colleagues still working on paper.\n>\n> While some examiners have fully adapted to a complete paperless work, there\n> is a substantial number of examiners who, for various reasons, continue to\n> work with paper dossiers. As acknowledged in the IPI note, examiners will\n> still be able to print the documents individually at the local printers.\n> However, this measure is not enough from an organisational point of view at\n> examiner level. These paper dossiers need to be stored and more importantly,\n> to be retrievable by the examiner in charge at any moment in order to\n> perform a proper examination work.\n>\n> In this open letter, we propose that the service of providing examiners with\n> file wrappers labelled with stickers be maintained so that locally printed\n> dossiers can be easily stored in an organised manner.\n>\n> Sincerely yours\n>\n> The Central Staff Committee - CSC\n\nThey recently made a joke, but there's nothing funny about that. It's a\nserious problem [1, 2]. They're hiding all their misconduct in Microsoft\nsystems that spy on workers.\n\nHere's the full letter:\n\n> European Patent Office 80298 Munich Germany\n>\n> Central Staff Committee Comit\u00e9 central du personnel Zentraler\n> Personalausschuss\n>\n> centralSTCOM@epo.org\n>\n> Reference: sc24023cl\n>\n> Date: 18/04/2024\n>\n> European Patent Office | 80298 MUNICH | GERMANY\n>\n> Mr Ant\u00f3nio Campinos President of the EPO\n>\n> Mr Steve Rowan Vice-President DG1\n>\n> By email: president@epo.org vp1@epo.org\n>\n> ### OPEN LETTER\n>\n> Discontinuation of central printing and storage of paper dossiers\n>\n> Dear Mr President, Dear Mr Vice-President of DG1,\n>\n> The discontinuation of on-demand paper files was announced on 26 March 2024\n> during the Easter Holidays and implemented a few days later on 1 April 2024.\n> No statutory consultation in the COHSEC and the GCC took place beforehand.\n> The decision took staff by surprise without any transitional period and\n> hence was negatively perceived, especially among the non-negligible number\n> of colleagues still working on paper.\n>\n> While some examiners have fully adapted to a complete paperless work, there\n> is a substantial number of examiners who, for various reasons, continue to\n> work with paper dossiers.\n>\n> It is appreciated that, as acknowledged in the IPI note, examiners will\n> still be able to print the documents individually at the local printers.\n> However, this measure is not enough from an organisational point of view at\n> examiner level. These paper dossiers need to be stored and more importantly,\n> to be retrievable by the examiner in charge at any moment in order to\n> perform a proper examination work.\n>\n> We propose therefore that the service of providing examiners with file\n> wrappers labelled with stickers be maintained so that locally printed\n> dossiers can be easily stored in an organised manner.\n>\n> This will contribute on the one hand to minimise paper use (stored and\n> retrievable documents do not need to be printed several times) and on the\n> other hand to keep the efficiency of the examiners concerned.\n>\n> We believe that this solution would be a fair recognition of the needs of\n> staff and would contribute to repairing the damages caused among the\n> concerned staff by the sudden implementation without consultation.\n>\n> Yours sincerely,\n>\n> Derek Kelly Chairman of the Central Staff Committee\n\nDerek Kelly seems to be under attack at the moment.
