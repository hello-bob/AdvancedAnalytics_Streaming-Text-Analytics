Credit:\nJessica Parzygnat, NC State University.\n\nIn a comparison of differently sized poultry farms, researchers at North\nCarolina State University found that rates of Salmonella in fecal and\nenvironmental samples were more prevalent on larger commercial farms than on\nsmaller backyard farms.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, multidrug resistance was found in Salmonella samples\nfrom both types of production systems, even though antibiotics are not used on\nbackyard farms and are only used sparingly on commercial farms.\n\nThe findings could help small and larger farms understand more about the\nspread of Salmonella in their respective systems.\n\n\"We wanted to look at backyard broiler farms; broilers are chickens that are\nraised for meat consumption rather than egg consumption,\" said Jessica\nParzygnat, an NC State Ph.D. graduate and first author of a paper describing\nthe research. The paper appears in Foodborne Pathogens and Disease.\n\n\"Broiler chickens are the top consumed meat in the U.S. and the world, but\nthere's not much research on backyard farms, which are growing in popularity\nin the U.S.\n\n\"The Centers for Disease Control has been issuing warnings on Salmonella\noutbreaks from backyard poultry farms in the last several years, so we wanted\nto see what pathogens are on backyard farms but also compare that to\ncommercial farms.\"\n\nResearchers tested 10 backyard and 10 commercial flocks. The smallest backyard\nflock was 22 birds and the largest was 1,000 birds; all backyard farm birds\nlived outdoors. Commercial farms, meanwhile, had tens of thousands of birds\nthat lived indoors.\n\nThe researchers tested bird fecal samples, as well as environmental conditions\nlike litter, soil, and feeders, for the presence of Salmonella, in addition to\nother pathogens. Researchers also examined compost samples on backyard farms.\n\n\"We tried to examine where Salmonella is prevalent on farms through testing\nbird fecal samples and also the environment around them,\" Parzygnat said. \"We\nfound less Salmonella on backyard farms (19.1% of samples) than commercial\nfarms (52.3% of samples). We expected that, because previous studies had shown\nlow rates of Salmonella on backyard farms. At the same time, our rates of\nSalmonella in samples on backyard farms were higher than in other studies\nlooking at backyard poultry in the U.S.\n\n\"Both types of farm managers need to be careful with their birds,\" Parzygnat\ncontinued. \"There's a feeling that backyard birds are safer than commercial\nbirds, but even though we found less Salmonella, the proportion of Salmonella\nin backyard farms and commercial farms that were multidrug resistant\u2014meaning\nthat they showed resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics\u2014was\nactually not significantly different.\"\n\nParzygnat says that common-sense prevention measures can help consumers avoid\nSalmonella effects, including cooking chicken thoroughly and avoiding cross\ncontamination while handling and preparing poultry.\n\n\"Salmonella can be natural inhabitants of the bird gastrointestinal tract and\nthe birds won't really show signs of illness,\" she said. \"I think one of the\nmajor concerns my research highlights is the antibiotic resistance associated\nwith it because that really heightens the concern of infection.\"\n\nNC State's Sid Thakur is the paper's corresponding author.
