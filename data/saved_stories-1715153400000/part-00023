However, EEG signals are very delicate and susceptible\nto various types of noise, including electromagnetic interference. This manual\nprovides guidelines for measuring EEG data using PiEEG while minimizing noise.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, let\u2019s take a look at PIEEG, but this concept\napplies to other boards as well.\n\nTo begin, you\u2019ll want to connect the cables and electrode clips. One clip\nelectrode acts as a reference point, against which all EEG measurements, in\nmicrovolts, are conducted. In simpler terms, we measure the voltage between\nthe ear and the electrode attachment point on the head. The bias electrode\nclip is need for eliminating electromagnetic noise, but it is not enough to\nsolve all problems. It is necessary pay attentions for the next moments:\n\n1\\. It\u2019s crucial that the device relies solely on battery power, screen, etc.,\ncompletely independent from the grid power supply. Avoid using power from a\nPC, USB, etc.\n\n2\\. Opt for wired connections for the keyboard and mouse to minimize wireless\ninterference (not Radio).\n\n3\\. Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on the RaspberryPi.\n\n4\\. Position the device away from sources of disruptive noise like computers,\nWi-Fi routers, phones, etc.\n\n5\\. Ensure there\u2019s effective insulation between the device and its resting\nsurface, such as a rubber mat or even a book.\n\n6\\. Ground contact with your feet can introduce noise; consider using foot\ninsulation or avoiding contact with the floor during measurements, and better\ndon\u2019t use metal stool.\n\n7\\. Body movements can generate artifacts; hence, it\u2019s vital for electrodes to\nestablish good skin contact (without causing discomfort to the subject) and\nremain stationary.\n\n8\\. Applying gel can enhance the electrode-to-skin contact area, albeit\nunpleasant, it helps reduce noise from electrode micro-movements.\n\nSo, any ideas let me know\n\nGeneral view\n\nConnection\n\nWould you like to receive news?\n\nOur company\n\n  * BCI IS PIEEG\n  * Contact\n  * Docs\n  * Job\n  * Liabilities\n  * News\n  * PiEEG Shop\n\nStay connected\n\nWe are open to connections and collaborations\n\n", "frontpage": false}
