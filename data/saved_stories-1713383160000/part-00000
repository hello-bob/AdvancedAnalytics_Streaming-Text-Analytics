And by CVE description, the team means a CVE-tagged\nadvisory shared by NIST \u2013 eg, this one for CVE-2024-28859.\n\nThe unsuccessful models tested \u2013 GPT-3.5, OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B, Llama-2\nChat (70B), LLaMA-2 Chat (13B), LLaMA-2 Chat (7B), Mixtral-8x7B Instruct,\nMistral (7B) Instruct v0.2, Nous Hermes-2 Yi 34B, and OpenChat 3.5 \u2013 did not\ninclude two leading commercial rivals of GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude 3 and\nGoogle's Gemini 1.5 Pro. The UIUC boffins did not have access to those models,\nthough they hope to test them at some point.\n\nThe researchers' work builds upon prior findings that LLMs can be used to\nautomate attacks on websites in a sandboxed environment.\n\nGPT-4, said Daniel Kang, assistant professor at UIUC, in an email to The\nRegister, \"can actually autonomously carry out the steps to perform certain\nexploits that open-source vulnerability scanners cannot find (at the time of\nwriting).\"\n\nKang said he expects LLM agents, created by (in this instance) wiring a\nchatbot model to the ReAct automation framework implemented in LangChain, will\nmake exploitation much easier for everyone. These agents can, we're told,\nfollow links in CVE descriptions for more information.\n\n\"Also, if you extrapolate to what GPT-5 and future models can do, it seems\nlikely that they will be much more capable than what script kiddies can get\naccess to today,\" he said.\n\n  * What's up with AI lately? Let's start with soaring costs, public anger, regulations...\n  * GenAI will be bigger than the cloud or the internet, Amazon CEO hopes\n  * Arm CEO warns AI's power appetite could devour 25% of US electricity by 2030\n  * What if AI produces code not just quickly but also, dunno, securely, DARPA wonders\n\nDenying the LLM agent (GPT-4) access to the relevant CVE description reduced\nits success rate from 87 percent to just seven percent. However, Kang said he\ndoesn't believe limiting the public availability of security information is a\nviable way to defend against LLM agents.\n\n\"I personally don't think security through obscurity is tenable, which seems\nto be the prevailing wisdom amongst security researchers,\" he explained. \"I'm\nhoping my work, and other work, will encourage proactive security measures\nsuch as updating packages regularly when security patches come out.\"\n\nThe LLM agent failed to exploit just two of the 15 samples: Iris XSS\n(CVE-2024-25640) and Hertzbeat RCE (CVE-2023-51653). The former, according to\nthe paper, proved problematic because the Iris web app has an interface that's\nextremely difficult for the agent to navigate. And the latter features a\ndetailed description in Chinese, which presumably confused the LLM agent\noperating under an English language prompt.\n\n## How to weaponize LLMs to auto-hijack websites\n\nNOW READ\n\nEleven of the vulnerabilities tested occurred after GPT-4's training cutoff,\nmeaning the model had not learned any data about them during training. Its\nsuccess rate for these CVEs was slightly lower at 82 percent, or 9 out of 11.\n\nAs to the nature of the bugs, they are all listed in the above paper, and\nwe're told: \"Our vulnerabilities span website vulnerabilities, container\nvulnerabilities, and vulnerable Python packages. Over half are categorized as\n'high' or 'critical' severity by the CVE description.\"\n\nKang and his colleagues computed the cost to conduct a successful LLM agent\nattack and came up with a figure of $8.80 per exploit, which they say is about\n2.8x less than it would cost to hire a human penetration tester for 30\nminutes.\n\nThe agent code, according to Kang, consists of just 91 lines of code and 1,056\ntokens for the prompt. The researchers were asked by OpenAI, the maker of\nGPT-4, to not release their prompts to the public, though they say they will\nprovide them upon request.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Developer\n  * Government\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Developer\n  * Government\n  * Security\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Advanced persistent threat\n  * API\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Authentication\n  * BEC\n  * Black Hat\n  * BSides\n  * Bug Bounty\n  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n  * Confluence\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  * Database\n  * Data Breach\n  * Data Protection\n  * Data Theft\n  * DDoS\n  * DEF CON\n  * Digital certificate\n  * Encryption\n  * Exploit\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * Firewall\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Git\n  * Google AI\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * Hacker\n  * Hacking\n  * Hacktivism\n  * IDE\n  * Identity Theft\n  * Incident response\n  * Infosec\n  * Insider Trading\n  * Jenkins\n  * Kenna Security\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * NCSAM\n  * NCSC\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Palo Alto Networks\n  * Password\n  * Phishing\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Quantum key distribution\n  * Ransomware\n  * Remote Access Trojan\n  * Retro computing\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Spamming\n  * Spyware\n  * Star Wars\n  * Surveillance\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * TLS\n  * Trojan\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Vulnerability\n  * Wannacry\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n  * Zero trust\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sector\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n4 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Developer\n  * Government\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Developer\n  * Government\n  * Security\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Advanced persistent threat\n  * API\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Authentication\n  * BEC\n  * Black Hat\n  * BSides\n  * Bug Bounty\n  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n  * Confluence\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  * Database\n  * Data Breach\n  * Data Protection\n  * Data Theft\n  * DDoS\n  * DEF CON\n  * Digital certificate\n  * Encryption\n  * Exploit\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * Firewall\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Git\n  * Google AI\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * Hacker\n  * Hacking\n  * Hacktivism\n  * IDE\n  * Identity Theft\n  * Incident response\n  * Infosec\n  * Insider Trading\n  * Jenkins\n  * Kenna Security\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * NCSAM\n  * NCSC\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Palo Alto Networks\n  * Password\n  * Phishing\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Quantum key distribution\n  * Ransomware\n  * Remote Access Trojan\n  * Retro computing\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Spamming\n  * Spyware\n  * Star Wars\n  * Surveillance\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * TLS\n  * Trojan\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Vulnerability\n  * Wannacry\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n  * Zero trust\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sector\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Google Cloud chief is really psyched about this AI thing\n\nCloud Next We're on a highway to ML\n\nPaaS + IaaS8 days | 6\n\n#### What's up with AI lately?
