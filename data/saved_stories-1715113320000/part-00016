While any company\nwould have been overjoyed to have an avowed and openly loyal customer as\npresident, it was an especially salient moment for the beleaguered train\nsystem, which is heavily reliant on federal funding and had received\nrelatively little of it throughout much of its 53-year history.\n\nSlightly less than a year into Biden\u2019s presidency, in December 2021, Amtrak\ngot a transformative commitment of $66 billion, four times the amount it had\ngotten in the previous six years. It marked a sea change, because Amtrak can\nnow afford to both keep its current fleet of trains running and also invest in\nmuch needed infrastructure upgrades\u2014instead of having to choose between the\ntwo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always lived hand to mouth, year to year,\u201d Amtrak CEO Stephen Gardner\ntold Fortune in an interview. \u201cIt made it incredibly difficult to do multi-\nyear programs, because we might have the money to start them and pay for year\none, but no idea whether we\u2019d have money in year two or four or six.\u201d\n\nThe investments have already improved Amtrak\u2019s commercial performance. In the\nlast three months of 2023, Amtrak\u2019s ridership was 15% above pre-pandemic\nlevels, according to Gardner. The comeback was led by Northeast regional\nroutes, which stretch from Massachusetts to Virginia, where ridership grew 26%\nin the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2019,\naccording to data Amtrak provided.\n\nThe funding came as part of Congress\u2019 $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure\nbill, which allocated $66 billion dollars in rail investments across the\ncountry. The bill \u201cmakes available to Amtrak over the next five years the\nequivalent of what the federal government has invested in Amtrak over 50,\u201d\nGardner said.\n\nBut the added funding comes with added pressure\u2014can Amtrak, after years of\nbeing strapped for funds, pull off an infrastructure upgrade of this\nmagnitude?\n\n### A nationwide overhaul\n\nAllan Zarembski, director of the railway engineering program at the University\nof Delaware, said Amtrak does a \u201creasonably decent job\u201d of relying on fares to\ncover its operating costs, but it doesn\u2019t have additional money for capital\nupgrades and needs the government to fund its long-term projects.\n\nAnd Amtrak\u2019s infrastructure needs are immense.\n\nAmtrak was saddled with decrepit, winding tracks that made high-speed travel\nimpossible, locomotives that predate many of their passengers, and, in\nMaryland, a tunnel built during Reconstruction. Because of recurrent\nunderinvestment, the U.S. accumulated decades of unaddressed maintenance work\nthat it\u2019s now finally able to complete.\n\nWithout a guaranteed source of multi-year funding, it was virtually impossible\nto hire construction firms and ask them to take on large-scale infrastructure\nprojects. How could Amtrak expect a partner to commit to a years-long project\nif it wasn\u2019t sure it would have the money to pay them? Even if there were a\ncontractor willing to take such a leap of faith, federal law wouldn\u2019t allow\nit. Government agencies are prohibited from contracting for work beyond what\u2019s\nbeen allocated in a given fiscal year, according to Mike Schipper, a member of\nthe committee on America\u2019s infrastructure at the American Society of Civil\nEngineers.\n\nEven now that it finally has its long-yearned-for federal funding, Amtrak\nfaces challenges, not least of which is the complexity and number of the\nprojects themselves.\n\n\u201cThe big change for me as a leader, and for the company in general, is\nbuilding up this new capacity to design and construct these assets that are\nenormous in and of themselves,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cAny one of these projects is\nseveral billion dollars, and we\u2019re launching 10 of them at the same time.\u201d\n\nAmtrak has already deployed tens of billions of dollars for improvements\nacross the country. In the Northeast Corridor\u2014which stretches from Washington,\nD.C., to Boston\u2014plans are already underway to repair several bridges and\ntunnels along the country\u2019s busiest train route. There\u2019s also the beginnings\nof a project that would look at replacing certain tracks to allow for faster\ntrain speeds. In December, the Cascades route between Portland and Seattle\nadded two additional roundtrips. In the Southeast, Amtrak is undertaking a\n$3.7 billion project to expand rail coverage between Virginia and North\nCarolina.\n\n### Changing Amtrak\u2019s DNA\n\nSince the infrastructure bill sent Amtrak billions in funding and a mandate to\nfix up many of the country\u2019s railroads, it had to develop new capabilities.\nAmtrak went from becoming a train operator to now also a \u201chuge capital program\nmanagement entity\u201d and \u201ca construction company,\u201d according to Gardner.\nChanging so much of its DNA has come with some growing pains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been about accomplishing two things at once: run the thing you\nhave and build for the next generation,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThose two activities\nare often complementary; sometimes [they] conflict.\u201d\n\nTo enable its transformation from a train operator to a builder of the\nnation\u2019s infrastructure, Amtrak hired 8,500 employees from 2022 through 2023.\n\nIn order to access Federal Railroad Administration funds earmarked in the\ninfrastructure bill, Amtrak often has to collaborate with a web of federal,\nstate, and local government agencies. States often clamor for rail upgrades\nbut are reluctant to pony up the money needed to make it happen. In the past,\nstates like Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin have even outright rejected billions\nin federal rail funding, scuttling many of the plans Amtrak had for repairs.\n\nTo try to solve those problems, the federal government offered states a\nsweetheart financing deal for certain projects in the latest funding bill. In\naddition to covering a significant portion of construction, the federal\ngovernment would also pay for 90% of the operating costs in year one, then 80%\nthe following year, and 70% in the third year, sharing the expenses for a\ntotal of six years. Despite that, some states still need to be cajoled into\ncommitting to rail investments.\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019re at the beginning here, we need some successes under our belts,\nand then people will follow,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nThe nature of these projects means that some of these successes could take\nyears to come to fruition. But for perhaps the first time in its history\nAmtrak has, if not a bright future, a future it can plan for at all.\n\nAll of that isn\u2019t lost on Gardner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of time every Amtrak CEO before me has wished for, frankly,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cSo I\u2019ll never complain about it. I\u2019m the luckiest CEO in the company\u2019s\nhistory.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive\nnavigate the changing needs of the workplace.
