The Sort plugin\nuses the SortableJS project under the hood for the heavy lifting of sorting\nelements and provides a nice API for Alpine:\n\n    \n    \n    <ul x-sort>\n    \n    <li x-sort:item>foo</li>\n    \n    <li x-sort:item>bar</li>\n    \n    <li x-sort:item>baz</li>\n    \n    </ul>\n\nThis small, yet mighty plugin provides the following features:\n\n  * Sorting groups\n  * Custom drag handles\n  * Support for Ghost elements\n  * Customizable configuration for SortableJS\n\nThe author Caleb Porzio has also created a new screencast series on the\nLivewire Site for the Sort plugin. It takes you deep into building a sortable\ndrag-and-drop experience from the JS to the database.\n\nThe Livewire Sort Screencast Series\n\nThe series consists of 11 videos with over an hour of content:\n\n  * Building a Todo List\n  * Storing positions in the database\n  * Using Alpine's Sort Plugin\n  * Sorting items in the database\n  * Handling removals\n  * Adding drag handles\n  * Extracting a Blade Component\n  * Extracting an Eloquent Trait\n  * Re-arranging Items\n  * Sorting between groups\n\nTo get started with the Sort plugin, check out the Alpine Documentation. You\ncan also view the Sort screencasts on the Livewire Website.\n\nPaul Redmond\n\nStaff writer at Laravel News.
