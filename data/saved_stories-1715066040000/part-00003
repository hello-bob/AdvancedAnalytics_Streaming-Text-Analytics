Anomaly (March '24: +0.95\u00b0C)\n\n## UAH Global Temperature Update for April, 2024: +1.05 deg. C\n\nMay 2nd, 2024 by Roy W. Spencer, Ph. D.\n\nThe Version 6 global average lower tropospheric temperature (LT) anomaly for\nApril, 2024 was +1.05 deg. C departure from the 1991-2020 mean, up from the\nMarch, 2024 anomaly of +0.95 deg. C, and setting a new high monthly anomaly\nrecord for the 1979-2024 satellite period.\n\nThe linear warming trend since January, 1979 remains at +0.15 C/decade (+0.13\nC/decade over the global-averaged oceans, and +0.20 C/decade over global-\naveraged land).\n\nIt should be noted that the CDAS surface temperature anomaly has been falling\nin recent months (+0.71, +0.60, +0.53, +0.52 deg. C over the last four\nmonths), while the satellite deep-layer atmospheric temperature has been\nrising. This is usually an indication of extra heat being lost by the surface\nto the deep-troposphere through convection, and is what is expected due to the\nwaning El Nino event. I suspect next month\u2019s tropospheric temperature will\nfall as a result.\n\nThe following table lists various regional LT departures from the 30-year\n(1991-2020) average for the last 16 months (record highs are in red):\n\nYEAR| MO| GLOBE| NHEM.| SHEM.| TROPIC| USA48| ARCTIC| AUST  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n2023| Jan| -0.04| +0.05| -0.13| -0.38| +0.12| -0.12| -0.50  \n2023| Feb| +0.09| +0.17| +0.00| -0.10| +0.68| -0.24| -0.11  \n2023| Mar| +0.20| +0.24| +0.17| -0.13| -1.43| +0.17| +0.40  \n2023| Apr| +0.18| +0.11| +0.26| -0.03| -0.37| +0.53| +0.21  \n2023| May| +0.37| +0.30| +0.44| +0.40| +0.57| +0.66| -0.09  \n2023| June| +0.38| +0.47| +0.29| +0.55| -0.35| +0.45| +0.07  \n2023| July| +0.64| +0.73| +0.56| +0.88| +0.53| +0.91| +1.44  \n2023| Aug| +0.70| +0.88| +0.51| +0.86| +0.94| +1.54| +1.25  \n2023| Sep| +0.90| +0.94| +0.86| +0.93| +0.40| +1.13| +1.17  \n2023| Oct| +0.93| +1.02| +0.83| +1.00| +0.99| +0.92| +0.63  \n2023| Nov| +0.91| +1.01| +0.82| +1.03| +0.65| +1.16| +0.42  \n2023| Dec| +0.83| +0.93| +0.73| +1.08| +1.26| +0.26| +0.85  \n2024| Jan| +0.86| +1.06| +0.66| +1.27| -0.05| +0.40| +1.18  \n2024| Feb| +0.93| +1.03| +0.83| +1.24| +1.36| +0.88| +1.07  \n2024| Mar| +0.95| +1.02| +0.88| +1.34| +0.23| +1.10| +1.29  \n2024| Apr| +1.05| +1.24| +0.85| +1.26| +1.02| +0.98| +0.48  \n  \nThe full UAH Global Temperature Report, along with the LT global gridpoint\nanomaly image for April, 2024, and a more detailed analysis by John Christy,\nshould be available within the next several days here.\n\nThe monthly anomalies for various regions for the four deep layers we monitor\nfrom satellites will be available in the next several days:\n\nLower Troposphere:\n\nhttp://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/v6.0/tlt/uahncdc_lt_6.0.txt\n\nMid-Troposphere:\n\nhttp://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/v6.0/tmt/uahncdc_mt_6.0.txt\n\nTropopause:\n\nhttp://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/v6.0/ttp/uahncdc_tp_6.0.txt\n\nLower Stratosphere:\n\nhttp://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/v6.0/tls/uahncdc_ls_6.0.txt\n\n### 716 Responses to \u201cUAH Global Temperature Update for April, 2024: +1.05\ndeg.

A late summer cyclone caused the low.\n\nArctic sea ice minimum has trended up since 2012. So far the average for this\ndecade has been higher than for 2011-20. Current ice extent is not only above\nlast decades average but close to 2001-10.\n\n       * Willard says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 12:24 AM\n\nJohn,\n\nIf you pick the lowest optimum of any data set, there will be a higher trend\nsomewhere around that point.\n\nIf you take a look at the chart and click on the various items in the right\nmargin, you can compare the 2001-2010 average to the 2011-2020 average. There\nare also the 1991-2000 and the 1979-1990 averages.\n\nPlease report.\n\n       * Antonin Qwerty says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 2:53 AM\n\nYes, it does annihilate the nonsense claims of the McPhersonist cult who claim\nwe will have our first ice-free Arctic in the next three years, and then\npromptly go extinct.\n\nBoth extremes of the climate spectrum believe that what is happening right now\nis climate provided it agrees with their belief, but is not climate if it does\nnot. That applies also to the effects of climate change, such as ice melt. The\nMcphersonists represent the state of the climate relative to 1750 by the\nwarmest month in the last few years, while deniers choose the coldest month in\nthe last few years to represent their claim.\n\nOnly those of us in the middle who follow the real science of the IPCC\nunderstand that short term variation is not climate, whichever way it heads,\nand that only the centre of the distribution represents climate (applicable\nalso to its effects).\n\n       * John Tillman says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 9:06 AM\n\nThat Arctic sea ice has not made a new low since 2012 shows that those who\npointed out its cyclic were right. During its cyclic decline from near its\ncentury high in 1979, extent made new lows every five years. IPCC did not\npredict a 12 year uptrend since the record low in 2012.\n\nI have looked at decadal averages. As youd expect, the trend was down for\n1981-2020, but for the current decade presently appears up, as climatologists\nhave predicted based on prior centuries in the Holocene.\n\nWhen and if Arctic sea ice declines for 2021-30 under still rising CO2, the\nhypothesis that man-made global warming shrinks its extent will have been\nshown false and cyclicality confirmed.\n\n       * Willard says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 9:36 AM\n\nThe fact that the 2011-2020 average reaches lower lows than previous decade\naverages shows that cycle nuts still have a long way to go.\n\n       * John Tillman says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 10:17 AM\n\nNothing nutty about cycles. Whats crazy is to imagine Arctic sea ice was\nalways higher before CO2 started increasing after AD 1850.\n\nThe multi decadal cycle is 30 to 40 years. It was low during the 1920s to 40s,\nsuch that the Northern Sea Route along Siberia was open during WWII. Sea ice\ngrew from the late 40s until the PDO flip of 1977. Then it fell again until\n2007, when a new low record was set in the dedicated satellite record since\n1979. Since then, the trend has been sideways, and up since 2012, after which\nno new low records have been set.\n\nThe reality of cycles has already been confirmed. A calendar decade higher\nthan the prior one would not only reconfirm that fact but show the CO2\nhypothesis false.\n\nArctic ice in this century is higher than in most of the Holocene.\n\n       * Nate says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 1:33 PM\n\nAs you pointed out, in 2012, \u201cA late summer cyclone caused the low\u201d while the\nrest of the year was more ordinary.\n\nSo that sounds like the vagaries of weather that season of that year. Probably\nbetter to look at all year, and average over several years.\n\nWe are also seeing Antarctica reach new lows for last few seasons.\n\n       * Willard says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 2:15 PM\n\n> Nothing nutty about cycles.\n\n\u201cCycle nuts\u201d designate contrarians who cling to cycles even when being shown a\nclear trend from 1979 to now.\n\n       * John Tillman says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 4:56 PM\n\nThe Arctic sea ice downtrend from 1977 reversed in 2012. There has not been a\nnew low despite two Arctic cyclones in 2016 and one in 2020, as also in 2007.\nThat Arctic ice is growing in general explains why 2016 was higher than 2012.\n\nAntarctic sea ice shows the CO2-sea ice hypothesis false. Antarctic sea extent\nballooned dramatically in the dedicated satellite record from 1979 to 2014,\nwhile Arctic extent fell. No correlation with rising CO2 means no causation.\n\nSuper El Nio 2016 and two weather events in Antarctica then caused sea ice\nthere to decline. It started recovering, then was hammered by the Tongan\neruption.\n\n       * God says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 5:55 PM\n\nPointing out that Arctic sea ice is \u201chighest\u201d in ten years is an attempt to\nspread fake news.\n\nClimate trends are based on 30 year averages. A ten year event is natural\nvariation and would have occurred even if humans never spread across the\nglobe.\n\n       * Antonin Qwerty says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 6:24 PM\n\nJT\n\nArctic extent has indeed been up so far this decade. But if you believe you\ncan determine a \u201ccycle\u201d after just 4 years then you are deluding yourself ...\nthat is just wishful thinking.\n\n       * John Tillman says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 6:46 PM\n\nAQ:\n\nPlease read what I actually wrote. The last lower Arctic sea ice cycle was\nfrom 1977 to 2007 or 2012. It\u2019s not based upon three years in this decade.\nHowever, if the whole decade 2021-30 proves higher than the average for\n2011-20, as is possible, if not indeed probable, then the CO2 hypothesis will\nhave been falsified.\n\nThe previous low ice cycle, as noted was from around WWI to WWII, followed by\nthe high Arctic ice cycle, c. 1945-77, despite growing CO2 that whole time.\nWhile the Northern Sea Route was naturally open during WWII, the USSR built\nnuclear ice breakers to keep it open during summer in the 1950s, et seq.\n\nYou may have read the famous 1922 news article on disappearing Arctic sea ice.\nFor more than a century, climatologists, biologists, oceanographers and\nhistorians have known Arctic sea ice extent to be cyclic. Only \u201cclimate\nscientists\u201d, ie computer gamers who believe natural trends can be extrapolated\nindefinitely, fell for the scam, or claimed they bought into it.\n\n       * Antonin Qwerty says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 8:29 PM\n\nYou certainly use artistic licence when reporting on your \u201cscience\u201d.\n\n       * Nate says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 4:18 AM\n\nKohn,\n\n\u201cThe Arctic sea ice downtrend from 1977 reversed in 2012.\u201d\n\nIn the peak arctic sea ice period, March, there was no minimum in 2012, and no\ntrend reversal.\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/5484ekaw\n\nSo that suggests that September 2012 was a singular weather event, rather than\nan indicator of a trend reversal.\n\n       * Nate says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 4:40 AM\n\nMore important than sea ice, the land ice sheets on Greenland and W.\nAntarctica have continued to decline in mass.\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/cn7mvke5\n\n       * Nate says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 4:43 AM\n\nGreenland ice mass measured by satellite\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMnFbIDIEGs\n\n       * Nate says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 5:37 AM\n\n\u2018Kohn\u2019 Typo, should be John\n\n       * Willard says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 8:05 AM\n\n> The Arctic sea ice downtrend from 1977 reversed in 2012.\n\nYou might as well argue that the current SPY reversed the trend since 1977,\nJohn.

This\nallows the separation of different processes. In short, for periods from 2-10\nyears, and likely longer, CO2 lags temperature by six months. For the annual\nprocess, the delay is much shorter, but causality is in the same direction, as\nwould be expected given the relationship between vegetation and seasonal\ntemperature variations.\n\nIn the following plots, delay is observed as the slope on the phase response\n(blue traces) https://localartist.org/media/CO2_Temp_FRF_1st_detrend.png\n\nHaving spent quite a bit of time on this, I\u2019m convinced that changes in\ntemperature over the last fifty years cannot be attributed to CO2, unless it\ncan be shown that time runs backwards.\n\n       * bdgwx says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 11:18 AM\n\nCO2 did not follow temperature during the PETM nor is it following temperature\ntoday.

CO2\u2019s feedback factor\nis probably less than 1 for most scenarios (reasons). But even if it isn\u2019t it\nhas two limiting factors. The first is the speed at which the physical\nprocesses release carbon into the atmosphere.

CO2\ncan not raise temperatures. Dr. Spencer mentioned a likely cause: This is\nusually an indication of extra heat being lost by the surface to the deep-\ntroposphere through convection, and is what is expected due to the waning El\nNino event.\n\nAlso likely is the remaining thermal energy from the HTE.\n\nReply\n\n       * Norman says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 12:04 PM\n\nClint R\n\nAre you claiming insulation will not raise the temperature of a heated house\nin the winter?

Most know this, a\nfew crackpots like you, Swenson, and Gordon Robertson are not able to accept\nevidence that shows this to be the case. Primarily satellite values of\nmeasured IR values reaching them. The IR reaching the satellite is much less\nthan the surface is emitting. The radiant barrier acts as a radiant insulator\nfor the surface.

The atmosphere acts as an insulator, and prevents about\n30% of the Sun\u2019s energy at the \u201ctop of the atmosphere\u201d from even reaching the\nsurface. This enables life as we know it on Earth. Otherwise, maximum\ntemperatures would reach those recorded on the Moon \u2013 in excess of 120 C, well\nabove boiling point.\n\nAre you denying this simple fact, and the science behind it?\n\nYou might as well respond now, because I intend to repeat throwing your\nstatement back in you teeth until you are forced to face reality.\n\n       * Dixon says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 6:04 PM\n\nAnd for everyone that thinks CO2 heats the planet \u2013 please explain why water\nvapour doesn\u2019t do it more effectively?\n\nAny one versed in the science knows this spike is a major problem for\nconventional views of a greenhouse effect and global warming. There is no\nplausible mechanism I\u2019ve heard of to produce a spike in stratospheric\ntemperatures this big, and over this short a time period.\n\nWhatever it is completely overwhelms natural variability so it\u2019s definitely\nsomething significant and not properly characterised, and we don\u2019t know if its\nsomething baked in from some time ago, or caused by a more current process.\n\nMy money would be on high altitude aerosol chemistry we have ignored,\ntriggered by HTE. The one thing I would need extraordinary evidence for to\naccept, is that it\u2019s from anthropogenic CO2.\n\nMethane from melting tundra is a candidate I guess, but if that were the case,\nI\u2019m sure the people whose jobs depend on climate science being a thing would\nbe trumpeting \u2018we told you so\u2019 from their ivory towers.\n\n       * Antonin Qwerty says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 4:24 AM\n\nSummarising cLInt\u2019s response:\n\nSatellites do not measure surface temperatures.\n\n       * Arkady Ivanovich says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 5:14 AM\n\n\u201cAnd for everyone that thinks CO2 heats the planet \u2013 please explain why water\nvapour doesn\u2019t do it more effectively?\u201d\n\nYes, water vapor is the most important radiative and dynamic component of\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere. However, its concentration varies significantly with time\nand geographical location in accordance with the hydrological cycle of\nevaporation, condensation, and precipitation, and large scale circulation\nprocesses. CO2 on the other hand, is a nearly permanent component up to about\n80 km altitude.\n\nThe relationship between atmospheric CO2 and water vapor can be understood\nthrough the Clausius-Clapeyron equation which describes the equilibrium vapor\npressure of a liquid in terms of temperature. As the CO2 forcing raises\nEarth\u2019s temperature, the water vapor content of the atmosphere increases in\nresponse.\n\nIn summary, water vapor is a hefty passenger, but CO2 is the driver.\n\n       * Nate says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 5:25 AM\n\n\u201cStop with the cult tactics.\u201d\n\nYeah Norman, quit presenting facts, logic, and explanations.

Then top-it-off by insulting your opponents!\n\n       * Nate says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 5:32 AM\n\n\u201d The atmosphere acts as an insulator, and prevents about 30% of the Suns\nenergy at the top of the atmosphere from even reaching the surface. \u201d\n\nSorry that is called reflection, not insulation. And some of it makes it to\nthe surface before being reflected off snow and ice.\n\nAs usual, Swenson plays exceedingly dum about the abs.orbance of IR emitted\nfrom the Earth to space, which acts to insulate the Earths surface from the\nextreme cold of space.\n\n       * Stephen P. Anderson says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 5:58 AM\n\nDixon,\n\nYes, another step change, like the several before implies non- systematic\ncause.\n\n       * Willard says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 6:09 AM\n\nAccording to troglodytes, shrooms have an effect all the way down or they do\nnot cause anything.\n\n       * bdgwx says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 7:43 AM\n\nDixon: And for everyone that thinks CO2 heats the planet please explain why\nwater vapour doesnt do it more effectively?\n\nWater vapor does heat the planet. However, the big difference is that water\nvapor is a condensing gas whereas CO2 is noncondensing. Because H2O is a\ncondensing gas it is in a stable equilibrium with the temperature in\naccordance with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.\n\nPhysicists like to use a marble in a bowl to illustrate how stable\nequilibriums work. When the bowl is jostled around the marble moves in chaotic\ndirections along the walls, but it will always tend to settle towards its\nstable equilibrium at the bottom. Like the marble in a bowl water vapor gets\njostled above and below its equilibrium level in a chaotic manner too.\nPerturbations above this level result in more condensation. Perturbations\nbelow this level result in more evaporation. In this manner water vapor tends\nto settled towards its equilibrium level like the marble.\n\nCO2 does not have a stable equilibrium with the temperature like H2O does.\nThis is why CO2 can force a temperature change on its own and why H2O can only\namplify a change catalyzed by something else as part of a feedback.\n\n       * bdgwx says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 7:57 AM\n\nSPA: Yes, another step change, like the several before implies non- systematic\ncause.\n\nAs I\u2019ve told you before step changes do not eliminate systematic\ncontributions. Let me explain it conceptually with math. Let f(t) = t + sin(t)\nbe a function of a important variable within a system wrt to time t. The t\nterm on the rhs represents a linear systematic contribution and sin(t)\nrepresents a cyclic non-systematic contribution. When you plot this (desmos\nworks well) you\u2019ll a pause-up-pause-up pattern with step changes yet variable\nis clearly being influenced by a systematic contribution that causes it to\ntend upwards despite the non-systematic contribution. It is what happens when\nyou superimpose a non-systematic component (like sin(t) in f(t) or ENSO in the\nreal world) onto a systematic component (like t in f(t) or GHG forcing in the\nreal world).\n\n       * Clint R says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 8:12 AM\n\nArk and bdgwx ramble eloquently about their belief that CO2 can warm the\nplanet.\n\nBut, they don\u2019t seem to realize that beliefs ain\u2019t science.\n\nThey would have to show how CO2 does warm the planet. What is the exact\nmechanism? How can a 15\u03bc photon raise the temperature of a 288K surface? They\ncan\u2019t do that because it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n       * Bill Hunter says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 9:47 AM\n\nbdgwx says:\n\n\u201dAs Ive told you before step changes do not eliminate systematic\ncontributions.\u201d\n\nI agree with bdgwx here. But the real question is whether the non-systematic\npattern has a consistent influence. We agree with the need for a non-\nsystematic influence but we cannot eliminate that influence from having its\nown patterns of increasing effects such as planets aligning in batches and\nthen due to smaller differences in timing become non-aligned creating much\nlonger termed cycles. . .such as with the movement of multiple planets.\n\nThe fact is we cannot just handwave away effects that are variable AND have\nevidence of occurring within the record of interest that cannot be explained.\nThat only occurs when corruption is rampant. We are a much smarter specie than\nthat.\n\n       * Stephen P. Anderson says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 7:00 PM\n\nBill,\n\nMurray Salby (may he RIP) disagrees. The equation that BGDWX offers above does\nnot describe what we are seeing.\n\n       * Bill Hunter says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 11:01 PM\n\nClearly there is a non-systematic influence. (I am taking non-systematic to\nmean from outside the earth system).\n\nThe peak temperature in the 1940\u2019s is an example of a particularly large event\nthat CO2 models cannot begin to explain.\n\nBut as indicated by Syun Akasofu there are layers to this. CO2 when warmer\nthan the coldest days in the highest latitudes is going to help warm those\ntemperature up. The dark winter in the arctic you see a lot of variability in\nmean temperatures. Obviously if the atmospheric co2 is warmer than the surface\nits going to cause the surface to be warmer. thus I ascribe to the amount of\nwarming from CO2 being somewhere between .25C and 1.0C per doubling.\n\nBut also I ascribe to Dr Akasofu\u2019s statement that to understand anthropogenic\nwarming you have to understand natural warming. And understanding natural\nwarming isn\u2019t on the table due to the political corruption that runs rampant\nthrough our universities.\n\n       * Willard says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 11:02 PM\n\n> But the real question is\n\nOur Inspecteur Clouseau always haz ze question.\n\n       * Stephen P.

It\u2019s meant only as a simple example to\ndemonstrate a fundamental truth. The fundamental truth...systematic and non-\nsystematic can occur simultaneously and when they do it is possible for them\nto combine in manner that yields a pause-up-pause-up pattern. It\u2019s important\nto understand this fundamental truth using a simple example before trying to\napply it to the vastly more complicated real world.

Climate change is\nobviously wrought by a multitude of causes. Its just that mankind hasn\u2019t been\nable to create any sudden massive change thus all such changes such as the\nrecent warming event of ENSO on top of solar max, on top of ozone depletion,\non top of planetary alignment has all come together at the same time. Does\nthat sit on top of a gradual warming from CO2 or is this just a culmination of\nevents several years, decades, or centuries in the making? It can all be non-\nsystematic or it may be part systematic. I would agree with SPA if CO2 could\nonly warm the surface if the CO2 is colder as in the mainstream theory. But\nbelieve its just the opposite of that which means it plays a much more minor\nrole but not zero role.\n\n       * Stephen P. Anderson says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 6:52 PM\n\nBGDWX,\n\nOf course I understand it, do you? The F(t)= t is a straight line with some\npositive slope and the F(t)= sint is a sine wave oscillating around t. But\nthat\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing.

Anderson says:\n\n\u201dIn other words, the sine wave is systematic but the step-change isnt.\u201d\n\nThe big problem with CO2 being a large contributor is that the sine wave of\nwarming when looked at as a pattern in changes to warming rates leaves a\npattern of underlying warming as a straight line.\n\nBut CO2 emissions did not follow a straight line increase. The underlying rate\nof warming that isn\u2019t explainable didn\u2019t increase with a straight line\nincrease in emissions. Thus at a minimum the underlying warming below the step\nchanges is also a combination of waning natural warming and CO2 warming. So\nAkasofu is almost certainly right in his graph and when that graph is actually\nstudied by our researchers and attributed out of that will emerge the effect\nthat CO2 has. My initial reasonableness tests I did roughly 16 years ago\nestimated that CO2 contributed less than .5C per doubling.\n\nDr. Easterbrook\u2019s work, verified by other works strongly suggests that there\nis a natural pattern that is somewhat irregular that can create more than 3C\nwarming in 200-300 years. And our current warming is perfectly consistent with\nthat. Folks try to handwave away the facts while refusing to recognize it\nwaving it off as \u201dnoise\u201d.

Also, with a multi-\ndecadal sensitivity of only 6ppm/degC, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that the linear\nrise in temperature accounts for all of the change in [CO2], or if temperature\nis the cause, it\u2019s through a VERY slow set of processes.\n\nBTW, the sensitivity is visible in the frequency domain analysis, top left\ngraph, numbers in parenthesis.

If you live in an apartment, you will be forced to compete against\nother mandated EV owners to search for an unoccupied public charging stall.\nAnd if you are successful, it will take by a factor of 10 more time to charge\nyour BEV than what it would take to fill up at a gas station.\n\nAnybody beginning to see the insanity in this? Let\u2019s say if the global warming\nzealots are successful in forcing every American into a BEV. How much do you\nthink this will lower global mean temperature if implemented? This is a point\nChristy and Spencer have made for several years. Dr. Christy testified before\nCongress that if we can make America disappear, the affect on global mean\ntemperature would be so small, we could not measure it.\n\nI am all for climate research, and many thanks go to Spencer and Christy for\ntheir contributions, and for sharing their findings with the public. But when\nclimate researchers and public officials start advocating things, that should\nbe a red flag.\n\nAnybody agree?\n\nReply\n\n     * Clint R says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 12:14 PM\n\nMany good points there, Rob.\n\nThe evidence is that we\u2019re in a natural warming trend, that started in the\n1970s. Likely the warming is due to ocean oscillations. With the help of the\nArgo floats we\u2019re learning more and more about the oceans. Possibly in another\n50-100 years we will be able to actually predict such trends.\n\nThere is no need for any alarm. The GHE nonsense is NOT science. There isn\u2019t\neven a viable description/definition of such a thing. The nonsense is based on\npolitical agenda and supported by a ragtag alliance ranging from children to\nphony intellectuals.\n\nReply\n\n     * Tim S says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 4:14 PM\n\nI think the result for April demonstrates how much uncertainty there is\nclimate prediction and climate modeling.\n\nAs for the electric cars, in my experience any project that is motivated by\npanic will likely have problems. The success of any project is always in the\nplanning stage. Problems in the planning stage become amplified in the\nexecution phase.\n\nSolar panels do not work at night when most people will charge their cars.\nStorage batteries add more cost. What is the panic? There is plenty of time to\nfigure out how to make things more sustainable for the USA while 95% of the\nrest of the world\u2019s population continues to increase their 90% of carbon\nemissions.\n\nReply\n\n     * Gordon Robertson says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 4:30 PM\n\nrob...\u201dConfirmed!

I will say one reason\npeople often use a mean for temperature is because (when done appropriately)\nit can be used in equations that relate temperature to energy. For example, if\nUAH says the global average temperature of the troposphere increased by 0.5 C\nI can estimate that it took 1 kj/kg.C * 0.5 C * 3.85e18 kg = 1.9e18 kj of\nenergy assuming negligible changes in mass, specific heat capacity, or latent\nsources.

When you understand that gravity has the same\neffect on both sides, and all parts, then you can see how it can change the\ndirection. And changing direction is NOT axial rotation. (If the ball were\nactually spinning, the string would wrap around it. If Moon were actually\nspinning, we would see all sides of it.)\n\nI predict you STILL won\u2019t understand, because I can recognize your tendency to\ncultism.

The significance of WV\nis adding to the mass of air in the Tropics hence increasing the heat capacity\nof the air. In other words, tropical air holds more heat than air located\npoleward.\n\nAccording to Lindzen, that super-heated air is transported polewards as it\nrises and is transported by convection. Same in the oceans, where heat from\ntropical waters is transported poleward.\n\nWV plays a role in heating and heat transport but it has nothing to do with\nthe GHE and/or AGW theories.

However, I don\u2019t think I have read two scientists who describe\nthe GHE in the same manner. Richard Lindzen, an atmospheric physicist who\ntaught at MIT has his own version and he called the traditional GHE definition\na fantasy aimed at simplifying science for laymen.\n\nGerlich and Tscheuschner, both who work and teach in the field of\nthermodynamics, have falsified the popular GHE theory. They based their\ncritique initially on an experiment conducted by R. W. Wood in 1909 in which\nWood conclude that a greenhouse warms due to air being trapped in a greenhouse\nby the glass, and not by radiation being blocked by the glass. Wood was an\nexpert with gases like CO2 and he questioned the theory that a trace gas could\nwarm the atmosphere, hence his experiment.\n\nThere is no explanation for how trapped IR in a greenhouse can warm the air.\nThe alternative theory is that GHGs in the atmosphere slow down the radiation\nof IR from the surface hence raising the temperature. The rate of surface\nradiation is controhled by the temperature difference between all gases in the\natmosphere and the surface (Newton\u2019s Law of Cooling). The rate of cooling has\nnothing to do with GHGs.\n\nReply\n\n     * gbaikie says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 6:34 PM\n\nThe greenhouse effect is making a more uniform global temperature.

That dip represents\nenergy that would have escaped to space were it not for the opacity of CO2.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Earth and Mars, the width of the CO2 ditch corresponds approximately to\nthe width of the spectral region over which the atmosphere is nearly opaque to\nIR. Increasing atmospheric CO2 increases the width of the ditch and hence\nincreases the CO2 greenhouse effect.

Or to\nspeak more accurately, we have a value we can plug into the universe to make\nthis acceleration happen. Exactly what causes that value remains up for grabs,\nand indeed frustrates current cosmology, for something close to 70 percent of\nthe total mass-energy of the universe needs to be comprised of dark energy to\nmake all this work. Add on the mystery of dark matter and we actually see only\nsome 4 percent of the cosmos. \u2014 ... \u201cSo we have a mission concept that can\ndetect dark energy within our Solar System by measuring deviations found\nwithin the classic Newtonian gravitational field. And GDEM is hardly alone as\nscientists work to establish the nature of dark energy. This is an area that\nhas fostered astronomical surveys as well as mission concepts, including the\nNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the European Space Agencys Euclid, the Vera\nRubin Observatory and the DESI collaboration (Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument). GDEM extends and complements these efforts as a direct probe of\ndark energy which could further our understanding after the completion of\nthese surveys.\u201d https://www.centauri-dreams.org/\n\nReply\n\n  37.

While Cassini realized the Moon was rotating once per orbit, it wasn\u2019t\nuntil Tobias Mayer recorded the position of crater Manilius over time that the\nangle and location of the Moon\u2019s rotational axis was determined.\n\nNow if the Moon\u2019s orbit was circular and its rotational axis normal to its\norbital plane I would \u201cjust say that the Moon is simultaneously spinning and\nnot spinning.\u201d\n\nBecause of the angle of the axis astronomers can see the lunar rotation in\nrelation to the Earth. Because the Moon slows in its orbit at apogee and\nspeeds up at perigee astronomers can tell the rotation isn\u2019t in lock step with\nthe Moon\u2019s orbital position.\n\nAnd I find it a bit insulting to Newton, Galileo, Cassini, Mayer and all of\nthe other astronomers that anyone would trash their observations without so\nmuch as taking a measurement.\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379722008282\n\nReply\n\n       * Gordon Robertson says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 5:40 PM\n\nThere is nothing in the 3 volumes of Principia to suggest Newton claimed the\nMoon spins on a local axis. If he had thought that, knowing Newton, he would\nhave expanded on it, explaining the rotation. There is nothing about rotation\nother than a statement I put down to the interpreter mistaking the meaning of\nNewton\u2019s words.\n\nThe initial translation was made after Newton\u2019s death and the translator could\nnot consult with him. Apparently, the translator went on the conclusions of\nCassini, not Newton.\n\nIf you read Newton on lunar motion, he states...\n\n1)the Moon moves with a linear motion. 2)the linear motion is bent into a\ncurvilinear motion by Earth\u2019s gravitational field. 3)the Moon keeps the same\nface pointed at the major ellipse focus where Earth is located.\n\nAll three points, when taken together can have no other interpretation than\ncurvilinear motion without local rotation. Also, the three points are a direct\ncontradiction of the interpretation that the Moon rotate exactly once per\norbit.\n\nNewton used the Latin revolvir in Old Latin. Revolvir can be translated in\nseveral ways in the context of motion and the translator used it to indicate a\nlocal rotation. I am betting that Newton meant it as an orbit where the Moon\nwas revolving round the external axis, the Earth.That jives with his three\npoints above whereas a local rotation does not.\n\nWhat Mayer was observing was a libration which he mistook for a physical\nrotation.

It\nis simply not enough to accelerate the Moon.\n\nThe explanation for the ***speed change*** is the Moon\u2019s tremendous momentum.\nIt is generally in equilibrium with Earth\u2019s gravitational force but the\ngravity component varies slightly. As it weaken, the lunar momentum, which is\nconstant, carries the Moon farther in the same time, hence the speed orbital\nspeed changes.\n\nSpeed is not velocity, which is a vector quantity.

I\u2019m asking you for a viable, physical model of \"orbit without spin\"\nwhich fits with your ludicrous idea of what that is.\n\nYou see, you could opt for a yo-yo with a frictionless axle. It would move the\nway you want it to, but it would objectively be spinning on that axle in order\nfor it to do so. So, it wouldn\u2019t be a viable physical model of \"orbit without\nspin\", now would it?\n\nOr, you could go with an XY plotter programmed to move a model celestial\nobject in a circle. That would move the way you want it to, and it would not\nbe spinning, but it would have nothing to represent the force of gravity. Not\nviable, either.\n\nI\u2019d bet that anything you could come up with would fall into one of those two\ncategories \u2013 objectively spinning, or not having anything to represent the\nforce of gravity.\n\n       * Craig T says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 12:15 PM\n\nAn example would be the ISS when it doesn\u2019t use its attitude control system to\nkeep the same side facing Earth.

But because the lunar day, arising from its uniform revolution\nabout its axis, is menstrual, that is, equal to the time of its periodic\nrevolution in its orb, therefore the same face of the moon will be always\nnearly turned to the upper focus of its orb; but, as the situation of that\nfocus requires, will deviate a little to one side and to the other from the\nearth in the lower focus; and this is the libration in longitude; for the\nlibration in latitude arises from the moon\u2019s latitude, and the inclination of\nits axis to the plane of the ecliptic.\u201d\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Newton%27s_Principia_(1846).djvu/410\n\n       * Dr Roys Emergency Moderation Team says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 5:42 PM\n\nKreg, you still haven\u2019t actually posted a viable physical model of \u201corbit\nwithout spin\u201d.

The way that works is\nreally no different from the way adding fiberglass insulation or low-\nemissivity windows to your home increases its temperature without requiring\nmore energy input from the furnace. Carbon dioxide is just planetary\ninsulation.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWe know how fibreglass acts to reduce heat loss, it actually interacts with\nair molecules to slow their passage to the outside walls where they would cool\nquickly. How do air molecules in the atmosphere do the same?\n\nThe GHE/AGW theory is even more mysterious since alarmists claim it is surface\nradiation that mainly cools the surface. They posit further that slowing down\nradiation somehow changes the rate of heat dissipation at the surface.\n\nQuantum theory tells us that heat is lost at the time radiation is created.\nTherefore, after radiation leaves the surface there is no way to affect the\nrate of heat loss, since the heat is already lost at a different rate.\n\nWe could regard the atmosphere as a buffer zone between the surface and space\nbut as an insulator, any insulation effect would apply only to air molecules,\nwhich implies conduction/convection. The atmosphere can have little or no\neffect on radiation just as fibreglass has no effect on it.\n\nThe atmosphere, due to its negative pressure gradient caused by gravity, acts\nas a natural heat dissipator for conduction/convection. As heated air\nmolecules at the surface rise naturally, they go through an ever-decreasing\nnegative pressure gradient, and as a result, they lose heat as they rise.\n\nNorman doesn\u2019t understand any of this and he will no doubt resort to insults\nand ad homs due to his frustration.\n\nReply\n\n     * Craig T says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 7:43 PM\n\n\u201cQuantum theory tells us that heat is lost at the time radiation is created.\u201d\n\nAnd that radiation is the only way energy can leave the Earth.

Willard says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 7:44 PM\n\nSOLAR MINIMUM UPDATE\n\nA century ago, we knew essentially none of what are now considered the basic\nfacts of cosmology. This situation changed rapidly, first on the theoretical\nfront in the 1910s, then on the observational front in the 1920s.\n\nCosmology studies the universe on the largest scales, and over large scales\nthe most important force of nature is gravity. Our modern understanding of\ngravity is the theory of general relativity, proposed by Einstein in 1915. The\nkey insight in this theory is the idea that space and time can be curved and\nhave a dynamical life of their own, changing in response to matter and energy.\nAs early as 1917, Einstein applied his new theory to cosmology, taking as an\nassumption something we still believe is true: that on the largest scales,\nmatter in the universe (or at least our observable part of it) is uniform\nthrough space. He also assumed, consistent with the apparent implication of\nobservations at the time, that the universe was static. To his surprise,\nEinstein found that general relativity implied that any uniform universe would\nnecessarily be non-static either expanding or contracting. In response he\nsuggested modifying his theory by adding a new parameter called the\ncosmological constant, which acted to push against the tendency of matter to\ncontract together. With that modification, Einstein was able to find a static\n(but unstable) solution if the cosmological constant were chosen precisely to\nbalance against the attraction of matter on large scales.\n\nThis discussion became somewhat academic when Edwin Hubble and Milton Humason\nannounced in 1929 that the universe is expanding: distant galaxies are\nreceding from us at speeds that are proportional to their distance. It had\nonly been in 1924 that Hubble had established that the spiral nebulae, which\nmany thought were clouds within our own galaxy, were separate galaxies in\ntheir own right, demonstrating the true vastness of the universe. The\ncollection of stars we live in, the Milky Way galaxy, contains something over\n100 billion stars, and there are over 100 billion such galaxies within the\nobservable universe. https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/writings/dtung/\n\nReply\n\n     * Swenson says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 7:59 PM\n\n\u201ctaking as an assumption something we still believe is true:\u201d\n\nAh, I see.

Craig T says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 8:28 AM\n\n\u201cYes, the ISS flies an LVLH attitude. LVLH stands for local vertical, local\nhorizontal. That means we describe the attitude of the ISS with respect to a\nreference frame that is defined as follows:\n\nX axis \u2013 aligned with the velocity vector Y axis \u2013 aligned with the orbital\nmomentum vector Z axis \u2013 aligned with the orbital radius vector\n\nIf the ISS is flying LVLH (0,0,0) it\u2019s body axis is coincident with the LVLH\nframe. Typically, we fly a small bias from the LVLH.\n\nIn order to maintain an LVLH attitude, the ISS maintains a 4 degrees per\nminute pitch (the nose moves downwards at 4 degrees per minute). 4 degrees per\nminute is the rate needed to rotate a full 360 degrees in 90 minutes (the\naverage orbital period).\n\nIt\u2019s important for the ISS to do this because it was designed to fly in this\nattitude. We need the communications and GPS antennae to point upwards, we\nneed the meteor shielding to be in the front, and we need the Lab window to be\nfacing down.\n\nIt isn\u2019t hard to maintain that rotation because, as Sir Isaac tells us, an\nobject in motion remains in motion unless acted upon.\u201d\n\nReply\n\n     * Craig T says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 8:32 AM\n\nNASA\u2019s Robert Frost answering the question \u201cDoes the ISS rotate during orbit\nto keep the same attitude with respect to the ground below?\u201d\n\nReply\n\n     * Clint R says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 9:19 AM\n\nI\u2019ve seen this before, Craig.

ISS would rotate for\nit\u2019s solar panels. Unlike earth surface which gets solar power for at most for\n25% of time, at higher elevation ISS gets solar polar 60% of the time. Or 60%\nof a 90 min ISS day. So at it\u2019s night, I suppose it keeps rotating to be in\nposition to catch it\u2019s dawn. 24 / 1 1/2 is 16. So ISS has 16 dawns for every\nEarth dawn.\n\n       * Craig T says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 1:07 PM\n\nThe easiest way to keep solar panels aimed at the sun would be to not rotate.\nBecause the ISS has to rotate to keep the same side oriented to the Earth (see\nabove) it turns 360 degrees each orbit.\n\nThe solar panels are designed to rotate separate from the ISS, at least on one\naxis, so the rotation of the station is not done to angle the panels.\n\n       * gbaikie says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 1:17 PM\n\nSolar panels were created for space {they would not exist without space\nexploration]. And solar panels on ISS are far more viable than solar panels on\nEarth\u2019s surface. The battery needs electrical power for 40% of 90 mins. Unlike\nearth which needs 16 hours per day.\n\n       * Clint R says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 1:21 PM\n\nBy not understanding the motions, Craig and gb get everything overly confused,\nas usual.\n\nThe ISS wants to keep one side facing Earth, like Moon. ISS would do that by\nitself, if it were in distant space. But ISS is in LEO, which means it is\naffected by the atmosphere, as weak as it is. So ISS must produce its own\nattitude and altitude adjustments to maintain its desired orbit and\norientation.\n\nThe ISS really has NOTHING to do with the Moon issue. It\u2019s just more crap\nthrown against the wall.\n\n       * gbaikie says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 1:51 PM\n\n\u201cThe ISS wants to keep one side facing Earth, like Moon.\u201d\n\nWhat side? I never heard of any side of ISS being the earth facing side. NASA\nor anyone, would want to get the most amount of solar power, it can get. 60%\nof the time getting solar power, might seem like a lot to someone living on\nEarth, but it\u2019s better to get more than 60%.\n\n       * gbaikie says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 1:55 PM\n\nFor instance, there are spots in the lunar polar region, which one can get,\n85%.

I never heard of any side of ISS being the earth facing side.\n\nFrom Craig\u2019s source: It\u2019s important for the ISS to do this because it was\ndesigned to fly in this attitude.

The Moon and the ISS only keep the same side to the Earth because\nboth have angular momentum that rotates them once per orbit.\n\nMy general issue here is those same people won\u2019t listen to anyone who\ndisagrees with their views on science no matter how high the stack of evidence\nis against them.

A TEA attitude is one that with deviations of up to 15 degrees\nresults in the external torques caused by gravity and drag canceling (or\nnearly canceling) each other out, over an orbit. The CMGs then just have to\nproduce the torques necessary to perfect that. If the CMGs are taken off-line,\nthe ISS would quickly leave the commanded attitude due to those external\ninfluences.\n\nWe fly a local vertical, local horizontal (LVLH) TEA. To maintain a local\nvertical, local horizontal orientation, a four-degree per minute negative\npitch (360 degrees in an orbit that takes approximately 90 minutes) must be\nenacted. That pitch rate is initiated by the Russian thrusters that maneuver\nthe vehicle to an LVLH attitude and are then maintained by CMGs. CMGs are\nlarge spinning wheels that store angular momentum. Altering that momentum\nchanges the angular momentum of ISS, itself, creating torques to counter\nunwanted torques.\n\nReply\n\n       * Craig T says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 1:41 PM\n\n\u201cBut ISS is in LEO, which means it is affected by the atmosphere, as weak as\nit is.

An IR photon absorbed by a molecule knocks the molecule into a\nhigher-energy quantum state. [T]he energy of the photon will almost always be\nassimilated by collisions into the general energy pool of the matter and\nestablish a new MaxwellBoltzmann distribution at a slightly higher\ntemperature. That is how radiation heats matter in the local thermodynamic\nequilibrium limit.\n\n***\n\nQuantum theory is based on the relationship of an electron in an atom with the\nnucleus. There is no reference in it to molecules or Maxwell-Boltzmann.\nNothing Pierrehumbert mentions explains how \u2018radiation heats matter\u2019, as he\nputs it.\n\nHeat is the kinetic energy of atoms. It\u2019s the name given to that particular\nKE. That is, the energy part of KE, the E, is heat. Call it thermal energy if\nyou like, I call it heat.\n\nWhen an electron is in a higher orbit, it has a higher KE. That KE translates\nto heat over all the atoms in a mass. When the electron drops to a lower\norbit, it has to shed KE and it does so...somehow...by emitting EM(IR).\n\nFor Ark...once that heat is transformed to IR, it is gone...kaput!!! You\ncannot take heat produced later by GHGs absorbing surface IR, and equate that\nheat to the surface heat which has already been lost. There is nothing you can\ndo to affect the rate of that heat loss by CO2 producing heat.\n\nFurthermore, the entire surface is radiating and only 7% of that radiation is\nabsorbed by CO2. Even if you could transfer that heat back to the surface, 7%\nwon\u2019t make up for the 93% lost to space.\n\nHere\u2019s the neat part re electrons in orbitals. An electron carries a charge\nhence an electric field. That electric field produces a magnetic field when it\nmoves. Get it? E (electric field) and M (magnetic field) = electromagnetic\nenergy. If the electron is orbiting at so many cycle per second (more likely\nbazzillions of cps), the generated E and M field has a corresponding frequency\nrelated to the angular orbital frequency of the electron.\n\nI don\u2019t particularly care for that theory even though it is the basis of\nelectrical engineering theory because it is not explained how the electron got\nthe momentum to remain in orbit. Nor does it explain why electrons are\narranged neatly with so many electron allotted to particular orbitals.\n\nBohr did not think an electron moving in an orbit generated a magnetic field.\nI think he was full of it. Electron theory in the day was hardly known and\nsince, no one has been able to locate and/or measure electron activity in an\natom, so how the heck would they know? Bohr surely noted that an electron\nmoving to a lower orbit generates both E and M so why would it not do it in an\norbit. Probably too tiny to measure anyway.\n\nSo, there you have it, Pierrehumbert\u2019s understanding of quantum theory is null\nand void. I have always regarded him as a bluff artist, he talks a good show\nfor the good alarmist groupies.\n\nReply\n\n     * Craig T says:\n\nMay 5, 2024 at 7:45 PM\n\n\u201cQuantum theory is based on the relationship of an electron in an atom with\nthe nucleus.

Quantum\napplies to the discrete orbital levels to which Bohr confined the electrons to\norbit.\n\nThe outermost orbitals, called valence orbitals, or bands, have electron that\ncan be shared with another atom. In the case of carbon and oxygen, each atoms\nshares electrons with the other and the linear bonds formed, that hold the\natoms together to form a molecule, are shared electrons.\n\nAny vibration is due to those electron bonds vibrating, either length-wise, or\nabout the axis through the oxygen atoms and carbon.\n\nThe authors of your quote are speaking jargon.

If you travel around the tree but never turn you\nstay facing the same direction.\n\nIn space gyroscopes are useful tools to determine inertial direction.\nGyroscopes, like spinning planets and moons, do not change orientation while\nfollowing an orbital path.\n\nIn theory it\u2019s possible for a non-spinning object to keep the same orientation\nwhile in orbit, but any slight nudge would start it spinning in some\ndirection. That\u2019s why Newton knew that the Moon had to be spinning on its axis\nwhile orbiting the Earth. https://www.drroyspencer.com/2024/05/uah-global-\ntemperature-update-for-april-2024-1-05-deg-c/#comment-1665428\n\n       * Clint R says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 4:46 PM\n\nWrong again, Craig.\n\nBut I\u2019m glad to see you accept being a brain-dead cult id10t. Some of your\ncult seems to resent their status. You don\u2019t appear to have the same animus as\nsilly willy, Norman, bob, and Bindi.\n\nActually accepting that you\u2019re brain-dead is, at least, accepting some\nreality, huh?\n\n  65. Christos Vournas says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 11:29 AM\n\nOur Moon does not rotate about its own axis.\n\nSince Moons sidereal rotation period 27,32 days (in reference to the stars) is\nthe same as its orbital around Earth period, Moon definitely does not rotate\non its own axis.\n\nIf Moon rotated on its own axis, Moons sidereal rotational period should have\nbeen shorter than its orbital around Earth period.\n\n**** Moons sidereal spin (in reference to the stars) is a sum of Moons around\nEarth orbital, Moon\u2019s around sun orbital and Moons around its axis movements.\n\nSince Moons sidereal spin is equal to the Moons around Earth orbital movement,\nMoons axial spin is zero Moon does not rotate about its own axis.\n\n**** Planet Mercury rotates about its own axis.\n\nMercurys sidereal rotational period: 58,646 Earth days. Mercury orbits sun in\n87,97 Earth days. Mercurys diurnal period is 176 Earth days. ***\n\nOur Moon doesnt rotate about its own axis.\n\nMoons sidereal rotation period is equal to its around Earth orbital period:\n27,32 Earth days. Moons diurnal period is 29,53 Earth days.\n\nMoon\u2019s sidereal rotation period is shorter than Moon\u2019s diurnal period, because\nMoon also orbits sun.\n\nMoon\u2019s sidereal rotation spin = 1 /27,32 rot/day Moon\u2019s diurnal rotation spin\n= 1 /29,53 rot/day\n\nConsequently, Moon spins faster in reference to the stars than it spins in\nreference to the sun! Moon\u2019s spin in reference to the stars is faster, than\nits spin in reference to the sun, because Moon\u2019s spin in reference to the\nstars is a sum of two movements: 1. The Moon orbiting Earth. 2. The Moon\norbiting sun. \u2013 There is not any movement of Moon around its own axis. \u2013\nhttps://www.cristos-vournas.com\n\nReply\n\n     * Bindidon says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 4:05 PM\n\nhttps://www.noa.gr/\n\nReply\n\n  66. gbaikie says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 11:49 AM\n\nGlobal climate temperature is about a long duration of measured global\ntemperature. Global climate is about long duration of time, +30 years.\nRegional climate changes in shorter time periods. The region I live in, is\nhottest in the world, ie: \u201cDeath Valley has been famous for being one of the\nhottest and driest places in North America. In fact, Death Valley holds the\nrecord for the world\u2019s highest surface air temperature ever recorded: 134F\nobserved at Greenland Ranch on July 10, 1913.\u201d I don\u2019t live in Death Valley,\nbut I am close enough, as far as I am concerned. Anyhow it\u2019s climate has been\nwet and cold recently, though I didn\u2019t get any snow in my town, this year or\nlast. But lot in lower hills around me, whereas higher hills more often snow.\nAnd California\u2019s drought has ended, with dams at highest levels, ie: \u201cShasta\nLake water level (daily): 1061.60 feet elevation Full lake is 1067 feet\nelevation above sea level.

And suborbital is perhaps could be seen as more a\nmore pressing issue of US Space Force.\n\nWhereas NASA in going to Moon and going to Mars, could be more concerned about\nhaving big rockets, and orbital refueling, Long as NASA \u201csupported\u201d US\nmilitary space, but US Space Force should be more interested in supporting\nNASA.
