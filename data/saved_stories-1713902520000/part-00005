In this work, we argue that\n> one of the primary vulnerabilities underlying these attacks is that LLMs\n> often consider system prompts (e.g., text from an application developer) to\n> be the same priority as text from untrusted users and third parties. To\n> address this, we propose an instruction hierarchy that explicitly defines\n> how models should behave when instructions of different priorities conflict.\n> We then propose a data generation method to demonstrate this hierarchical\n> instruction following behavior, which teaches LLMs to selectively ignore\n> lower-privileged instructions. We apply this method to GPT-3.5, showing that\n> it drastically increases robustness -- even for attack types not seen during\n> training -- while imposing minimal degradations on standard capabilities.\n\nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Computation and Language\n(cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.13208 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.13208v1 [cs.CR] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Eric Wallace [view email] [v1] Fri, 19 Apr 2024 22:55:23 UTC (573 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled The Instruction Hierarchy: Training LLMs to\nPrioritize Privileged Instructions, by Eric Wallace and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CL cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
