I wanted to let the experience settle as my perception\ncontinues to evolve/mature/unfurl (couldn\u2019t find the right word), and to take\nadvantage of Daniel Kahneman\u2019s advice to employ our \u201cslow thinking.\u201d I was\nalso inspired to do some research on the background and technology of the\ncraft I traveled on, and the drug an increasing number of people are using ...\nin a variety of settings. Anyway, here goes.\n\n#### Anesthetic\n\nKetamine was developed as a surgical anesthetic. It replaced PCP \u2014 yes, that\nPCP \u2014 which was effective, but patients frequently emerged from\nunconsciousness confused and sometimes hallucinating, a state known as\n\u201cemergence delirium.\u201d Scientists modified the compound until they hit on a\nvariation that had similar anesthetic properties but with less risk of\npsychedelic side effects. First synthesized in 1962 and tested on Michigan\nstate prisoners in 1964, ketamine remains in widespread use as an anesthetic\ntoday.\n\nKetamine produces less emergence delirium than PCP, but it does have that\neffect, and in the 2000s, researchers started looking more closely at the\nunusual phenomenon. The \u201cdissociative state\u201d is characterized by a sense of\ndetachment from reality and one\u2019s physical self, or even consciousness.\nDissociation can occur without drugs \u2014 psychotic hallucination is a type of\ndissociation \u2014 but the particular sense of detachment from the self that\nketamine produces (and other psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD can\nproduce) turns out to be a potentially powerful tool. It can enable personal\ngrowth as well as enhance artistic and intellectual expression. Research\ninterest in this phenomenon opened the door to a broader insight: While the\nmechanism is not yet fully understood, there is growing evidence that at sub-\nanesthetic doses, ketamine can help resolve serious mental health conditions,\nincluding anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and depression.\n\n#### Depression\n\nThe most thoroughly studied and accepted therapeutic use of ketamine is for\ntreating depression and, in particular, treatment-resistant depression.\nDepression is a modern scourge. It afflicts an estimated 280 million people\nworldwide, and nearly 18% of U.S. adults report they are currently in\ntreatment for depression \u2014 up from just 10% a decade ago. Depression factors\ninto two-thirds of suicides, killing over 30,000 Americans per year.\nAntidepressants are effective for many but are ineffective or bring major side\neffects for others \u2014 around a third of patients suffer from treatment-\nresistant depression. Over the last decade, dozens of studies have shown\nketamine to be particularly effective for this cohort.\n\nSimilar to other antidepressants like Prozac, ketamine works by altering our\nbrain chemistry \u2014 it increases the availability of substances the brain uses\nfor internal communication. But beyond its direct chemical impact, ketamine\n(and other psychedelics) offers an additional dimension to treatment: the\ndissociative state and the greatly enhanced neuroplasticity that follows it.\nDepression and other disorders are so difficult to escape in part because they\nchange not just our brains but also our minds. They influence how we see the\nworld and ourselves, and directly interfere with our ability to change. The\ndissociative state induced by psychedelics allows us to see ourselves from a\ndistance, to disentangle our disorders from our identities. Patients report\nbeing able to face deeply buried traumas without suffering and to acknowledge\nunhelpful patterns of behavior without defensiveness.\n\nOver the past 15 years, interest in psychedelic-assisted therapy has renewed\nand accelerated. Michael Pollan\u2019s 2018 book, How to Change Your Mind,\ncatalyzed popular interest, but general awareness was just catching up with\nthe science. Because ketamine can be more effective when combined with\ntherapy, some doctors have opened specialized clinics where ketamine\nexperiences are integrated with therapy and other treatments. A few weeks ago,\nI visited one.\n\n#### Prof K\n\nI\u2019d been considering ketamine therapy for a while. I struggle with anger and\ndepression, and thought it might help. Also, I was curious. Similar to Burning\nMan, ketamine therapy is something I\u2019ve planned on doing for several years but\nI always find an excuse not to go \u201cthere.\u201d I was wary that something unwelcome\nwould surface. Whatever trauma or demons lie in my subconscious, I\u2019ve managed\nto (mostly) suppress them. And I\u2019m down with that \u2014 let sleeping dogs lie. But\nhere we go.\n\nAt Kuya Wellness in Austin, the first step was a detailed interview about my\nmedical history. The onboarding process was both comforting \u2014 they take this\nseriously \u2014 and a bit disconcerting (see above: This is serious). I was\napproaching the experience as a more cerebral form of the Space Mountain ride.\nExcept, at Disney World, the screening is only that you be at least 3 feet 8\ninches tall. If you had to meet with a doctor and go over your medical history\nat the beginning of the line, you\u2019d be more pensive while you waited your turn\nto ride.\n\n#### Birkenstock Austin\n\nThe clinic felt like the Austin regional office of Birkenstock or the HQ of a\nsuccessful scented candle manufacturer \u2014 groovy but well funded. The first\nthing you encounter is a purposefully distressed shoe cubby that sets the\ntone, as everyone is barefoot. My guide, John, was out of central casting to\nlead a yoga retreat, or an angry professor\u2019s ketamine trip. He was about as\nchill as one could be while still maintaining an air of competence. I had an\nadditional intake with the medical director, an attractive woman in her 60s. I\nhad trouble focusing for the first few minutes as she had a Tammy Wynette\u2013like\nwig. It looked good, but she could have been the offspring of Sophia Loren and\nBeyonc\u00e9. I immediately summed her up as a rich housewife who, after the kids\nleft, got bored/depressed, decided to get a degree, and convinced some rich\ninvestors to fund her adventures in ketamine.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, I was wrong. Dr. Sheila Newsom was the captain of the\nbaseball team at West Point, served her country for four years as a\nparatrooper, got a medical degree from the University of Texas, and built a\nhospital in Africa. At 63, Dr. Newsom underwent gender transformation and\nanswered a call to help people suffering from suicidal ideation via ketamine\ntherapy. Jesus Christ, an amazing athlete who served her country and later in\nlife felt a calling to be her true self while helping others. So, the first\n\u201cunlocks\u201d from ketamine were before the ketamine: I am judgmental, and there\nare so many remarkable Americans. Just as grit is a combination of resilience\nand forgiveness, I\u2019d like to think \u201cAmerican\u201d is a mix of opportunity and\nacceptance. The two are force multipliers for one another. I worry that\nAmerica, for the first time in our history, is becoming less accepting. Less\nAmerican. But that\u2019s another post.\n\nThe trip room was what you would expect to find in the home of a Gen-Xer who,\nafter his kids are asleep, takes an edible and retreats to a room with an\noversize sectional, a flat-screen, and no sharp edges (speaking for a friend).\nDr. Newsom joined John and me in the opium den, grasped our hands, and prayed\n... which I found oddly comforting. For some reason I requested a weighted\nblanket. I\u2019d never used one, nor really knew what it was ... but it just felt\nright. John and I did some breath work and then Dr. Newsom injected me with 87\nmilligrams of ketamine.\n\n#### Elevator Up\n\nShit got real, or unreal, pretty fast. I felt heavy but not uncomfortable.\nWary but not anxious. With the blindfold on I was in the Sphere (Vegas\nimmersive theater), only this was to the Sphere what the Sphere is to a black-\nand-white television. Walls of red numbers and symbols bumping into, and\nabsorbing, each other as the sheets of imagery expanded and contracted as if\nthey were breathing. The visuals took on a sentient feel and turned to emotion\nand experiences that then liquified and poured over my consciousness. I\nimmediately felt a sense of wonder for a drug that could inspire this depth of\nhallucination, this fast, without the feeling of being out of control. Then\nthings got weird.\n\nImagine your brain is a tightly wound knot of experiences, emotions, visuals,\nand neural pathways (your consciousness). Ketamine loosens the knot and\nunfurls everything, including material that\u2019s there but not previously\nvisible. The strands of the knot then separate from your physical self and all\nthings. People have described it as floating through space. For me, it felt\nlike a different dimension where there was nothing physical, just my being. My\nthoughts and perceptions were untethered from any organic or inorganic\nmaterial. A friend who several years ago urged me to try K therapy described\nit best: It\u2019s as if your life is an ocean. And you can see some stuff below\nthe surface, but it\u2019s not clear. K drains the ocean so you can walk along the\nfloor and see everything in sharp relief.\n\nRecognizing that my senses and emotions (i.e., perception) were the only\n\u201creal\u201d thing was overwhelming, and for a few moments unsettling. How was my\nperception formed? Jesus, this is me ... and what does \u201cme\u201d really mean?\nSimilar to when I was a kid on a long road trip with my mom, I\u2019d ask myself\nover and over, \u201cWho am I? Who am I?\u201d and then feel faint. I\u2019d tell my mom;\nshe\u2019d tell me to not think about that kind of thing. Ketamine doesn\u2019t care\nwhat your mom says. Trying to wrap my conscience around itself and understand\nmy being, my soul felt overwhelmed. Never panicked, like being too high (been\nthere), just overwhelmed.\n\n#### Bahne\n\nA couple images kept resurfacing. First and foremost, I have specific pictures\nof my boys that I\u2019m fond of and they appeared square in front of me. Except,\nthey were in 4K, high def. I, similar to most parents, think my boys are the\nmost beautiful things ever created. The depth of commitment and love I feel\nfor them felt impossible. Impossible in a good way, as if it was a secret that\nwould only be revealed to them when they had kids. The images were just so\nilluminant, and the emotion so strong.\n\nTheir mother appeared as well, and she produced entirely different emotions.\nAt first, a surprise ... who is this? Then a sense of relief and joy. When I\nwas 10 my only hobby was skateboarding. I bought a skateboard at Big 5 for $3.\nIt was a piece of pressed balsa wood with steel wheels. We had to check our\nskateboards in at the beginning of school to the principal\u2019s office and then\nretrieve them when school was over. Anthony Fadale and friends would mock me\nand my board when he and his crew picked up their Dogtown and Zephyr boards.\n\nMy mom\u2019s boyfriend, Terry, was leaving on Sunday and left a UPS box on the\ndining table. In the box was a new Bahne skateboard with AC500 trucks and KONA\nwheels. This board cost $45, which might have well meant $45 million for my\nmom and me. The feeling of surprise and joy when I realized this was mine was\nsimilar to the emotion that registered when the image of my wife came into\nview. This relationship is mine ... really?\n\nI also had some anxiety around things that were on my mind, bothering me. I\ndon\u2019t think K is good at sorting, and these things were only there as they\nwere present at that moment. I\u2019d said something stupid at a conference earlier\nin the week onstage and had been an asshole to someone the same week. They\nboth kept coming up and confronting me.\n\n#### No Free Lunch\n\nThere is an increasing body of research showing that ketamine therapy can do\nwonderful things for people suffering from trauma, depression, and addictions.\nHowever, I would not recommend doing this recreationally or outside a\ntherapeutic environment. It is intense. What has struck me is the benefits of\nthe session have mostly occurred well after the session as I process the\nexperience and what to take from it. This is why several sessions done in a\nlicensed clinic in conjunction with a therapist is a best practice.\nRecreational use is spiking, and while it will be a light diversion for most\nusers, ketamine can be addictive and, when abused, can cause serious physical\nharm, including bladder infections and renal failure. Ketamine purchased from\nmail-order pharmacies or bought on the street is of uncertain provenance, and\nwhen sold in powdered form, is often cut with other substances including\nfentanyl.\n\n#### Clarifying\n\nDuring my trip, there was nothing new. No discovery, just clarification and\nillumination. I know I love my boys, and that their mom is impressive. But\nthis was a chance to bask in those emotions and register real reward. Also, in\nthe two weeks since the therapy I haven\u2019t had a drink \u2014 first time I\u2019ve gone\nthis long since college. It\u2019s not that I had a revelation that I drink too\nmuch (again, I knew that), I have just sort of lost the taste for it. We\u2019ll\nsee. Again, the majority of the benefit has been post-therapy processing the\nexperience, what I take from it and how it will change my behavior and\nperspective moving forward. Some thoughts:\n\n  * Feeling the depth of emotion for my boys gives me a sense of purpose. I love the notion of \u201csurplus\u201d value, that you become a man when you add more than you take. Sort of a spiritual profitability if you will. My purpose is to love my boys, and others, more than I\u2019ve been loved. I\u2019m almost there, and it gives me a sense of peace about aging and dying (note: not planning to do this anytime soon). I used to be terrified of death, and feeling purpose take shape \u2014 and that it\u2019s within reach \u2014 provides comforting permission to leave. As they say in the Navy, \u201cFair winds and following seas, we have the watch.\u201d\n  * I\u2019ve also come to the conclusion that the quality of your relationships isn\u2019t a function of that person but of you. Specifically, your willingness to lean into the relationship and not keep score. For most of my life, relationships have been transactional. And I was either on the right side of the ledger \u2014 getting more than I receive \u2014 or dissatisfied. I realize that my role is, among those close to me, to provide witness to their life. For them to know that I notice. To rescue them from any doubt that they matter, that when good or bad things happen to them ... that I notice. Their life happens, and registers, as a decent man who loves them provides witness.\n\nMy son has a ring on a necklace inscribed with a quote from one of my favorite\nchildhood movies, The Little Prince: \u201cWhat is essential is invisible to the\neye.\u201d When I called my wife after the therapy and told her she was a\nskateboard, and why, there was a long silence on the other end. However, I\nknew what she was feeling. We didn\u2019t need to hear or see each other. It didn\u2019t\nmatter, as the essential is invisible.\n\nLife is so rich,\n\nP.S.

Mike Rabin says:\n\n4 weeks ago at 4:27 pm\n\nScott, thank you for sharing your experience and understanding the care that\nis needed around servicing ketamine treatment.\n\nOn a previous episode of your podcast, you interviewed Ronan Levy about the\npsychedelic industry. You read a question of mine on that episode, around the\ntime that we were beginning a two-year inquiry into the intersections of\npsychedelics and corporate capitalism. We just published the findings of that\nstudy.\n\nWhen you get the chance, I would invite you to read the abstract of this essay\nand consider bringing this research to your students or audiences.\n\nhttps://corporate.substack.com/p/consequences-of-the-psychedelic-renaissance\n\nConsequences of the Psychedelic Renaissance A critical study at the\nintersections of psychedelics, corporate capitalism, and this moment in\nhistory\n\nCheers, Mike\n\n  2.

John Bentley says:\n\n1 month ago at 7:06 am\n\nI have taken just about every hallucinatory drug in my lifetime and I am now\n84 and of perfectly sound mind and body. From Thai sticks to peyote and\nmescalin to magic mushrooms and ketamine to angel dust and ecstasy to LSD and\nOpium. In my view the effect depends completely on the state of mind of the\nuser at the time of using. It is vital to be receptive and enquiring mentally\nand to be in a fit state of mind and body if possible. If you take these drugs\nas a replacement or as a staff to lean on they are dangerous and must only be\nused occasionally for enquiry and for fun. Many psychedelic drugs have the\nsame effect of starving the body of sugar as the fasting of 40 days and nights\nof biblical prophets It is essential not to eat or drink any substance with\nsugar while taking. I have experienced some of the best moments of my life\ntaking psychedelics, particulary in sharing with loved ones mentally and\nphysically. I have no doubt whatever that it opens far broader new dimensions\nof the mind of than humans use normally and one of my heroes Dr Francis Krick\nthe discoverer of DNA claimed in his biography that taking LSD revealed the\nsecret of DNA to him.\n\n  4.

Palanivel R says:\n\n1 month ago at 3:54 am\n\nPara 5 beginning \u201cSimilar to other antidepressants\u201d and ending \u201cacknowledge\nunhelpful patterns of behavior without defensiveness\u201d runs like an exact\ndescription of what a sensitive reader experiences while reading fictional\nclassics\u2013the Victorian, American and the American greats. As English majors\n(first half of Seventies) arriving at experiential correspondences and\nencountering parts of oneself submerged till then while reading them was an\nexperience prevalent and shared. It was therapy enough for quite a few of us.\nBut the merciless march of relativism propelled by ever mushrooming new\nfangled theories termed such works as exercises to uphold Eurocentricism and\nimperialism. They are now treated by quite a number of people as somethings\nthat the cat brought in. The Departments of English prefer to keep mum on this\nas speaking favorably of canonical works is heresy now. Just wondering whether\nwe jettisoned something that was working after all in order to appear more\nhip.\n\n  6. Glen says:\n\n1 month ago at 5:13 pm\n\nK-therapy can\u2019t solve the world\u2019s problems. Why do we think that our problems\ncan be solved without taking into account the loveless systems that grind us\nto pieces? We cannot. K-therapy only serves the interests of those making\nmoney from it, and those seeking redemption. To hell with the rest of the\nworld.\n\n  7.

RAO says:\n\n1 month ago at 7:19 am\n\nAndrew Huberman, PhD, (hubermanlab.com) has an excellent podcast episode in\nwhich he discusses Ketamine at length. Says he, \u201cIn this episode, I explain\nhow ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to\nrelieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I\nexplain how ketamine impacts both the brain\u2019s glutamate and its endogenous\nopioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how\nketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar\ndepression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other\npsychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective\neffects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I\ncompare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of\nketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the\npotential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term\n\u2018K-holes\u2019). This episode should interest anyone interested in ketamine,\ntreatments for depression, neuroplasticity mechanisms, psychiatry and mental\nhealth.\u201d\n\n  9. Noel says:\n\n1 month ago at 4:25 am\n\nThanks for this. I think it could be really useful to have updated reflections\nin six months or so.

Did you read any of this? K is prescribed for all kinds of\nthings, and these clinics are all over. Arrested?

The depth of\ncommitment and love I feel for them felt impossible.\u201d\n\nThe visceral love that you have for your sons is so beautiful and yet,\ncompletely at odds with your stance on the Israel/Gaza conflict. How can you\nnot feel tremendous outrage and sorrow at the loss of 13,000+ Palestinian\nchildren, thousands more maimed and starving, and probably hundreds more\nburied under the rubble...and not grasp the incredible grief every Palestinian\nparent is feeling (if they themselves actually survived)?\n\nAnd if you can acknowledge that, how can you not call for a permanent\nceasefire AND a return of the hostages? What Israel is doing is criminal and\nthe US government is enabling it. Having this view is not anti-semitic, it is\nnot anti-American...which is what you have said. It\u2019s pro-humanity. In recent\nmonths, I have heard your thoughts on this topic on various podcasts and a\nrecent Bill Maher show, and I have become so disappointed with you, Professor\nGalloway.\n\nI have read your columns since Day One and understand that you are someone who\nhas gained a lot more empathy as you have gotten older. But it seems that your\nempathy is quite selective.\n\n  15. DMill says:\n\n1 month ago at 5:59 pm\n\nThe whole time I\u2019m reading this I thought it was an April fools joke.

SomePerverted NotionOfLiberty says:\n\n1 month ago at 4:29 pm\n\nJust a few months ago you were having a lot of fun ripping on Elon Musk for\nhis ketamine use. Remember the \u201cKetamine heart\u201d comment? Kind of messed up to\nmock someone for the prescribed drug he uses to treat his depression... but\nthat\u2019s the kind of cruel and messed up behavior we have all come to expect\nfrom you.\n\nNow just a few months later and you\u2019re a big fan of the drug and jumped on the\nketamine bandwagon to treat your depression.\n\nDon\u2019t you feel the need to apologize for your previous comments?\n\nEven just a quick 1 line public shout out. \u201cMusk, sorry I was mocking you for\nthis. I was wrong. Peace\u201d\n\nSee how easy that was?\n\nYou wrote an entire post talking about how much you dig this drug and it never\neven occurred to you that maybe you should apologize for mocking people that\nwere using this exact same drug just a few months ago?\n\nThere\u2019s something seriously wrong with you, Galloway.\n\n     * BB says:\n\n1 month ago at 5:27 am\n\nElon Musk: \u201cPut \u2018Never Went to Therapy\u2019 on my gravestone.\u201d If Elon Musk is not\nusing this in a therapeutic setting with a therapist, he\u2019s not using ketamine\ntherapeutically. Self-treatment with ketamine (i.e., without a therapist) is\nnot treatment, particularly in the case of a man who does, in fact, have\naccess to the finest medical care money can buy, and can definitely afford to\nhave a therapist administer the treatment properly. If you\u2019re looking for\napologies, maybe ask Musk to apologize for demonizing SSRI\u2019s as \u201czombifying\u201d\nwhen they have helped give millions of people relief from anxiety and\ndepression (and as someone who has taken them, I have not a clue what he means\nabout \u201czombifying\u201d \u2013 maybe he hasn\u2019t tried them either.). No one needs to\napologize for mocking Musk\u2019s recreational drug use.\n\n  20. Dan Theman says:\n\n1 month ago at 3:46 pm\n\nThx for sharing..but did you really need K to tell you to \u201cgive more than you\nreceive?\u201d Hope not.

When true understanding comes, whether thru K, thru a near\ndeath experience, from a profound author or in losing or finding a loved\none...it can be a life-changer. Sometimes we can use help from the outside.\n\n  21. Geoff Granville says:\n\n1 month ago at 3:13 pm\n\nThank you, Scott, for baring your soul. A very interesting and stimulating\npost. Just a note of caution to any \u2018DIYers\u2019 out there: there is something\nwrong with the stated quantity that was injected: \u201c87 milliliters of ketamine\u201d\nmakes no sense (there is no unit of weight in the term): please do some\nserious research before deciding on the dose!\n\n  22.

Nick Finegold says:\n\n1 month ago at 2:46 pm\n\nGreat piece Scott , like a lot of people our age I am open to trying new\nthings especially K and cybin although yet to action the urge , one thing\nabout which I am sceptical is my own ability to not \u201ckeep a ledger\u201d on ones\nrelationships as I think this maybe the most challenging undertakings in\nmankind\u2019s history , K or no K ,\n\npeace The Fat Gladiator\n\n  25. Lolita aaron says:\n\n1 month ago at 2:45 pm\n\nSuch deep wisdom and insight.. Thank you , once again Scott Galloway for this\npiece on your experience with Ketamine. It was enlightening and moving.. not\nsurprising that you had such a positive experience, Full of love and\nworthwhile insights.. You are a remarkable man.\n\n  26. Paul says:\n\n1 month ago at 2:43 pm\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting to hear about your experience for weeks and it did not\ndisappoint. I\u2019m 50 and have dealt with depression since high school. Nothing\nsevere, I simply attributed the occasional funk to genes as well as something\nthat creatives must endure to be, well, creative. A few years back I\nencountered some severe emotional trauma, which exacerbated my depression to\nlevels I had never before experienced as well as creating some lovely PTSD.\n\nI started therapy for the first time in my life and it was wonderful, but\ntough \u2014 so wish I had done this sooner in life. Unpacking one\u2019s life can feel\nlike receiving a gift that you thought you had already regifted. I did the\nwork but sometimes the wiring becomes so hardwired that drugs need to get\ninvolved \u2014 I\u2019ve tried just about all of them. Unfortunately, antidepressants\nand I didn\u2019t mesh well; the side effects were overwhelming, ranging from\nanxiety to a loss of libido. As a result, I ended my relationship with them.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been researching psilocybin and ketamine treatments, and both\nseem promising. I believe this could be the next step in my healing journey.\n\nThank you for sharing the details of your personal experience, Scott. The more\nwe discuss mental health the less stigma we allow it.\n\n  27. MJ says:\n\n1 month ago at 2:35 pm\n\nJust WOW. Thank you for sharing your experience. Will pack away your last\nclarifying thoughts. \ud83d\udcad\n\n  28. Stephen DeFalco says:\n\n1 month ago at 2:06 pm\n\nScott it\u2019s a great one! Your honesty is inspiring and helps me ;spurs me on to\nbe a better man and dad. Thx brother !\n\n  29. Mark says:\n\n1 month ago at 1:53 pm\n\nThe unlocks, the revelations.\n\nYou\u2019d find all of that as the norm in an Amish community. Even \u201cnormal\u201d\nAmericans have this already, but I\u2019d say most of them are cemented in a\ntraditional life.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re taking medicine to reverse the changes humanity has\ngone through in the last 50 years, because a lot of changes don\u2019t make you\nhappy.\n\nI tend to agree.\n\n  30. Nancy says:\n\n1 month ago at 1:51 pm\n\nThanks so much for writing about your experience. I had the same aha moment\nwhen I tried psilocybin mushrooms for the first time. \u201cWhat has struck me is\nthe benefits of the session have mostly occurred well after the session as I\nprocess the experience and what to take from it.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcaf\n\nAfter just one trip, I experienced closure that decades of therapy never\nproduced. On my second trip, I realized shrooms are not something at risk of\nbecoming a habit \u2013 you take them until you have all of your questions\nanswered. And the speed at which that can happen is mind blowing. I actually\nfeel angry that my boyfriend and parents, and even myself just a few months\nago \u2013 are taught to only think of them as illegal, recreational drugs. These\ntreatments COULD help so many people. Ugh.\n\n  31. Daniel Parker says:\n\n1 month ago at 1:30 pm\n\nI read the Pollan book and told my wife that before I\u2019m gone, I want to have\nsome of these managed experiences. On one hand, I\u2019ve got too many\nresponsibilities now to risk a profound change, if that makes sense. On the\nother hand, I just hope I have enough resources to be able to take the trip\nbefore the final destination. Keep trying to be a better asshole. We\nappreciate it.\n\n     * K says:\n\n1 month ago at 6:34 pm\n\nLove it!\n\n  32. Jeff Clark says:\n\n1 month ago at 1:24 pm\n\nThis: \u201cWhat is essential is invisible to the eye.\u201d Thanks, Scott!\n\n  33. Len Dugow says:\n\n1 month ago at 1:22 pm\n\nAs a \u201c devout \u201c Scout Galloway fan... this report on your \u201ck\u201d journey is so\ninformative and insightful... I will certainly share with my friends\n\nYour writings and podcasts continue to be so interesting... your emotional and\npsychological condition(s) keep inspiring me to \u201c do better and be better\u201d in\nmy work and personal relationships With gratitude\n\n  34. Martha Randolph says:\n\n1 month ago at 1:17 pm\n\nOne of your best, Scott. Some of your takeaways came right into my heart as\nyour work highlighted how much in relationships is up to me. So Dawg \u2013 I\u2019m\ngoing to act like a dog with more unconditional love and noticing. Although I\ndont plan to follow anyone into the bathroom. Thank you for this open sharing.\nI\u2019m in Austin and your deception was so spot on. Thanks, too, for the laugh.\n\n  35. Mark in CA says:\n\n1 month ago at 1:15 pm\n\nI worked in biology research and nursing. Ketamine is classified as a\nhypnotic, not an anesthetic although, as you wrote, it may be used in that\nway. It is also referred to as a tranquilizer. It is commonly used with\nanimals and I once saw an ER doctor order it to help a young child who had a\nfishing hook through a finger. The drooling, hypnotic state of her child\ncaused the mother to cry. One place used it on monkeys to keep them from\ngetting wild when they were handled for a health check. I don\u2019t know if\nputting yourself in a trance helps with emotional issues, but like I told\npatients in mental health, if what you are doing doesn\u2019t work, try something\nelse.\n\n     * Nancy says:\n\n1 month ago at 1:57 pm\n\nExactly. I think there are MANY people out there who think they have \u201ctried\neverything\u201d and they need to read stuff like this.\n\n  36. Anita says:\n\n1 month ago at 1:14 pm\n\nSo, the first \u201cunlocks\u201d from ketamine were before the ketamine: I am\njudgmental, and there are so many remarkable Americans. Just as grit is a\ncombination of resilience and forgiveness, I\u2019d like to think \u201cAmerican\u201d is a\nmix of opportunity and acceptance.\n\nWhat a line, Scott! Your willingness to expose your full self \u2013 warts & wings\n\u2013 continues to make you so worth tuning into.\n\n     * Truth says:\n\n1 month ago at 6:37 pm\n\nProfessor psycho \u2013 do some gardening and stop taking drugs you nutter\n\n       * Roach says:\n\n1 month ago at 7:25 pm\n\nGo touch grass mate.\n\n## Join the 500,000 who subscribe\n\nTo resist is futile ... new content every Friday.\n\nBy subscribing, you agree to receive emails from Scott Galloway and his edtech\nstartup, Section.
