The answer could upend our ideas\nabout what life is.\n\nBy\n\n  * Antonio Regaladoarchive page\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nStephanie Arnett/MITTR\n\nIt was a cool morning at the beef teaching unit in Gainesville, Florida, and\ncow number #307 was bucking in her metal cradle as the arm of a student\nperched on a stool disappeared into her cervix. The arm held a squirt bottle\nof water.\n\nSeven other animals stood nearby behind a railing; it would be their turn next\nto get their uterus flushed out. As soon as the contents of #307\u2019s womb\nspilled into a bucket, a worker rushed it to a small laboratory set up under\nthe barn\u2019s corrugated gables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something!\u201d said a postdoc named Hao Ming, dressed in blue overalls and\nmuck boots, corralling a pink wisp of tissue under the lens of a microscope.\nBut then he stepped back, not as sure. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d\n\nThe experiment, at the University of Florida, is an attempt to create a large\nanimal starting only from stem cells\u2014no egg, no sperm, and no conception. A\nweek earlier, \u201csynthetic embryos,\u201d artificial structures created in a lab, had\nbeen transferred to the uteruses of all eight cows. Now it was time to see\nwhat had grown.\n\n## Related Story\n\nHere\u2019s why I am coining the term \u201cembryo tech\u201d\n\nEmbryos hold the secrets of regeneration, reproduction, and maybe even human\nimmortality.\n\nAbout a decade ago, biologists started to observe that stem cells, left alone\nin a walled plastic container, will spontaneously self-assemble and try to\nmake an embryo. These structures, sometimes called \u201cembryo models\u201d or\nembryoids, have gradually become increasingly realistic. In 2022, a lab in\nIsrael grew the mouse version in a jar until cranial folds and a beating heart\nappeared.\n\nAt the Florida center, researchers are now attempting to go all the way. They\nwant to make a live animal. If they do, it wouldn\u2019t just be a totally new way\nto breed cattle. It could shake our notion of what life even is. \u201cThere has\nnever been a birth without an egg,\u201d says Zongliang \u201cCarl\u201d Jiang, the\nreproductive biologist heading the project. \u201cEveryone says it is so cool, so\nimportant, but show me more data\u2014show me it can go into a pregnancy. So that\nis our goal.\u201d\n\nFor now, success isn\u2019t certain, mostly because lab-made embryos generated from\nstem cells still aren\u2019t exactly like the real thing. They\u2019re more like an\nembryo seen through a fun-house mirror; the right parts, but in the wrong\nproportions. That\u2019s why these are being flushed out after just a week\u2014so the\nresearchers can check how far they\u2019ve grown and to learn how to make better\nones.\n\n\u201cThe stem cells are so smart they know what their fate is,\u201d says Jiang. \u201cBut\nthey also need help.\u201d\n\nSo far, most research on synthetic embryos has involved mouse or human cells,\nand it\u2019s stayed in the lab. But last year Jiang, along with researchers in\nTexas, published a recipe for making a bovine version, which they called\n\u201ccattle blastoids\u201d for their resemblance to blastocysts, the stage of the\nembryo suitable for IVF procedures.\n\nSome researchers think that stem-cell animals could be as big a deal as Dolly\nthe sheep, whose birth in 1996 brought cloning technology to barnyards.\nCloning, in which an adult cell is placed in an egg, has allowed scientists to\ncopy mice, cattle, pet dogs, and even polo ponies. The players on one\nArgentine team all ride clones of the same champion mare, named Dolfina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSynthetic embryos are clones, too\u2014of the starting cells you grow them from.\nBut they\u2019re made without the need for eggs and can be created in far larger\nnumbers\u2014in theory, by the tens of thousands. And that\u2019s what could\nrevolutionize cattle breeding. Imagine that each year\u2019s calves were all copies\nof the most muscled steer in the world, perfectly designed to turn grass into\nsteak.\n\n\u201cI would love to see this become cloning 2.0,\u201d says Carlos Pinz\u00f3n-Arteaga, the\nveterinarian who spearheaded the laboratory work in Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s like Star\nWars with cows.\u201d\n\n### Endangered species\n\nIndustry has started to circle around. A company called Genus PLC, which\nspecializes in assisted reproduction of \u201cgenetically superior\u201d pigs and\ncattle, has begun buying patents on synthetic embryos. This year it started\nfunding Jiang\u2019s lab to support his effort, locking up a commercial option to\nany discoveries he might make.\n\nZoos are interested too. With many endangered animals, assisted reproduction\nis difficult. And with recently extinct ones, it\u2019s impossible. All that\nremains is some tissue in a freezer. But this technology could, theoretically,\nblow life back into these specimens\u2014turning them into embryos, which could be\nbrought to term in a surrogate of a sister species.\n\nBut there\u2019s an even bigger\u2014and stranger\u2014reason to pay attention to Jiang\u2019s\neffort to make a calf: several labs are creating super-realistic synthetic\nhuman embryos as well. It\u2019s an ethically charged arena, particularly given\nrecent changes in US abortion laws. Although these human embryoids are\nconsidered nonviable\u2014mere \u201cmodels\u201d that are fair-game for research\u2014all that\ncould all change quickly if the Florida project succeeds.\n\n\u201cIf it can work in an animal, it can work in a human,\u201d says Pinz\u00f3n-Arteaga,\nwho is now working at Harvard Medical School. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the Black Mirror\nepisode.\u201d\n\n### Industrial embryos\n\nThree weeks before cow #307 stood in the dock, she and seven other heifers had\nbeen given stimulating hormones, to trick their bodies into thinking they were\npregnant. After that, Jiang\u2019s students had loaded blastoids into a straw they\nused like a popgun to shoot them towards each animal\u2019s oviducts.\n\nMany researchers think that if a stem-cell animal is born, the first one is\nlikely to be a mouse. Mice are cheap to work with and reproduce fast. And one\nteam has already grown a synthetic mouse embryo for eight days in an\nartificial womb\u2014a big step, since a mouse pregnancy lasts only three weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut bovines may not be far behind. There\u2019s a large assisted-reproduction\nindustry in cattle, with more than a million IVF attempts a year, half of them\nin North America. Many other beef and dairy cattle are artificially\ninseminated with semen from top-rated bulls. \u201cCattle is harder,\u201d says Jiang.\n\u201cBut we have all the technology.\u201d\n\nInspecting a \u201csynthetic\u201d embryo that gestated in a cow for a week at the\nUniversity of Florida, Gainesville.\n\nANTONIO REGALADO\n\nThe thing that came out of cow #307 turned out to be damaged, just a fragment.\nBut later that day, in Jiang\u2019s main laboratory, students were speed-walking\nacross the linoleum holding something in a petri dish. They\u2019d retrieved intact\nembryonic structures from some of the other cows. These looked long and\nstringy, like worms, or the skin shed by a miniature snake.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what a two-week-old cattle embryo should look like. But the\nouter appearance is deceiving, Jiang says. After staining chemicals are added,\nthe specimens are put under a microscope. Then the disorder inside them is\napparent. These \u201celongated structures,\u201d as Jiang calls them, have the right\nparts\u2014cells of the embryonic disc and placenta\u2014but nothing is in quite the\nright place.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call them embryos yet, because we still can\u2019t say if they are\nhealthy or not,\u201d he says. \u201cThose lineages are there, but they are\ndisorganized.\u201d\n\n### Cloning 2.0\n\nJiang demonstrated how the blastoids are grown in a plastic plate in his lab.\nFirst, his students deposit stem cells into narrow tubes. In confinement, the\ncells begin communicating and very quickly start trying to form a blastoid.\n\u201cWe can generate hundreds of thousands of blastoids. So it\u2019s an industrial\nprocess,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple.\u201d\n\nThat scalability is what could make blastoids a powerful replacement for\ncloning technology. Cattle cloning is still a tricky process, which only\nskilled technicians can manage, and it requires eggs, too, which come from\nslaughterhouses. But unlike blastoids, cloning is well established and\nactually works, says Cody Kime, R&D director at Trans Ova Genetics, in Sioux\nCenter, Iowa. Each year, his company clones thousands of pigs as well as\nhundreds of prize-winning cattle.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would like to see a way to amplify the very best animals as\neasily as you can,\u201d Kime says. \u201cBut blastoids aren\u2019t functional yet. The gene\nexpression is aberrant to the point of total failure. The embryos look blurry,\nlike someone sculpted them out of oatmeal or Play-Doh. It\u2019s not the beautiful\nthing that you expect. The finer details are missing.\u201d\n\nThis spring, Jiang learned that the US Department of Agriculture shared that\nskepticism, when they rejected his application for $650,000 in funding. \u201cI got\ncriticism: \u2018Oh, this is not going to work.\u2019 That this is high risk and low\nefficiency,\u201d he says. \u201cBut to me, this would change the entire breeding\nprogram.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne problem may be the starting cells. Jiang uses bovine embryonic stem\ncells\u2014taken from cattle embryos. But these stem cells aren\u2019t as quite as\nversatile as they need to be. For instance, to make the first cattle\nblastoids, the team in Texas had to add a second type of cell, one that can\nmake a placenta.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed instead are specially prepared \u201cna\u00efve\u201d cells that are better\npoised to form the entire conceptus\u2014both the embryo and placenta. Jiang showed\nme a PowerPoint with a large grid of different growth factors and lab\nconditions he is testing. Growing stem cells in different chemicals can shift\nthe pattern of genes that are turned on. The latest batch of blastoids, he\nsays, were made using a newer recipe and only needed to start with one type of\ncell.\n\n### Slaughterhouse\n\nJiang can\u2019t say how long it will be before he makes a calf. His immediate goal\nis a pregnancy that lasts 30 days. If a synthetic embryo can grow that long,\nhe thinks, it could go all the way, since \u201cmost pregnancy loss in cattle is in\nthe first month.\u201d\n\nFor a project to reinvent reproduction, Jiang\u2019s budget isn\u2019t particularly\nlarge, and he frets about the $2-a-day bill to feed each of his cows. During a\ntour of UFL\u2019s animal science department, he opened the door to a slaughter\nroom, a vaulted space with tracks and chains overhead, where a man in a\nslicker was running a hose. It smelled like freshly cleaned blood.\n\nReproductive biologist Carl Jiang leads an effort to make animals from stem\ncells. The cow stands in a \u201chydraulic squeeze chute\u201d while its uterus is\nchecked.\n\nANTONIO REGALADO\n\nThis is where cow #307 ended up. After a about 20 embryo transfers over three\nyears, her cervix was worn out, and she came here. She was butchered, her meat\nwrapped and labeled, and sold to the public at market prices from a small shop\nat the front of the building. It\u2019s important to everyone at the university\nthat the research subjects aren\u2019t wasted. \u201cThey are food,\u201d says Jiang.\n\nBut there\u2019s still a limit to how many cows he can use. He had 18 fresh heifers\nready to join the experiment, but what if only 1% of embryos ever develop\ncorrectly? That would mean he\u2019d need 100 surrogate mothers to see anything. It\nreminds Jiang of the first attempts at cloning: Dolly the sheep was one of 277\ntries, and the others went nowhere. \u201cHow soon it happens may depend on\nindustry. They have a lot of animals. It might take 30 years without them,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d agrees Peter Hansen, a distinguished professor in\nJiang\u2019s department. \u201cBut whoever does it first ...\u201d He lets the thought hang.\n\u201cIn vitro breeding is the next big thing.\u201d\n\n### Human question\n\nCattle aren\u2019t the only species in which researchers are checking the potential\nof synthetic embryos to keep developing into fetuses. Researchers in China\nhave transplanted synthetic embryos into the wombs of monkeys several times. A\nreport in 2023 found that the transplants caused hormonal signals of\npregnancy, although no monkey fetus emerged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause monkeys are primates, like us, such experiments raise an obvious\nquestion. Will a lab somewhere try to transfer a synthetic embryo to a person?\nIn many countries that would be illegal, and scientific groups say such an\nexperiment should be strictly forbidden.\n\nThis summer, research leaders were alarmed by a media frenzy around reports of\nsuper-realistic models of human embryos that had been created in labs in the\nUK and Israel\u2014some of which seemed to be nearly perfect mimics. To quell\nspeculation, in June the International Society for Stem Cell Research, a\npowerful science and lobbying group, put out a statement declaring that the\nmodels \u201care not embryos\u201d and \u201ccannot and will not develop to the equivalent of\npostnatal stage humans.\u201d\n\nSome researchers worry that was a reckless thing to say. That\u2019s because the\nstatement would be disproved, biologically, as soon as any kind of stem-cell\nanimal is born. And many top scientists expect that to happen. \u201cI do think\nthere is a pathway. Especially in mice, I think we will get there,\u201d says Jun\nWu, who leads the research group at UT Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas,\nthat collaborated with Jiang. \u201cThe question is, if that happens, how will we\nhandle a similar technology in humans?\u201d\n\nJiang says he doesn\u2019t think anyone is going to make a person from stem cells.\nAnd he\u2019s certainly not interested in doing so. He\u2019s just a cattle researcher\nat an animal science department. \u201cScientists belong to society, and we need to\nfollow ethical guidelines. So we can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not allowed,\u201d he says. \u201cBut\nin large animals, we are allowed. We\u2019re encouraged. And so we can make it\nhappen.\u201d\n\n### by Antonio Regalado\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
