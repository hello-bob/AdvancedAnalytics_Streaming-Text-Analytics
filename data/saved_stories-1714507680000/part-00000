According to the report, these tablets allow\npilots to control a wide range of Western-supplied weapons such as U.S. AGM-88\nmissiles, French Hammer bombs, and U.K. Storm Shadow missiles.\n\nInterestingly, iPads also assist Ukrainian pilots in accessing essential\ninformation such as maps and flight data.\n\nTherefore, Apple iPads are serving as one of the key additions to older jets\nin combat operations in the ongoing conflict with Russia.\n\nWilliam LaPlante, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition and\nsustainment, says that the Ukrainian Air Force mainly uses old Russian and\nSoviet-era planes.\n\nWith help from the United States, they\u2019ve made it possible to use Western\nweapons on these old planes.\n\nPilots control these weapons with iPads. What\u2019s remarkable is that they\u2019re\nusing these modified planes in combat just a week after getting them.\n\nThe Su-27, which first flew in 1985, is still a powerful fighter jet used in\ncountries like Russia and China. But it couldn\u2019t control the new missiles and\nbombs given by Western allies to help Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict.\n\nThat said, using iPads in aviation isn\u2019t entirely new. Commercial airlines\nhave been using them for years as electronic flight bags, which means they\ndon\u2019t need to carry heavy paper documents. Plus, this saves weight and fuel.\n\nBesides military uses, Apple products have been handy in other ways during the\nconflict. For example, one Ukrainian used Find My to track retreating Russian\nforces after discovering they had stolen his AirPods from his home in Kyiv.\n\nSource\n\nApple featured iPad\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
