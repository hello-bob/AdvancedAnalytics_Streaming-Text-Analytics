On that day, several people sent me an article from\nThe Guardian, with this headline: \u2018It went nuts\u2019: Thousands join UK parents\ncalling for smartphone-free childhood. The article described the efforts of\ntwo British women who each had children in the 7-9 age range, the age at which\nmany British kids are given a smartphone. (In fact, 24% of British kids aged\n5-7 have their own smartphone.) They could see what had happened to children\nwho burrowed into their smartphones and never re-emerged. They didn\u2019t want\ntheir kids to be next. So they started a WhatsApp group to find other like-\nminded parents who would join them in breaking the norm, resisting, and maybe\neven trying to create a smartphone-free childhood.\n\nIt turned out that most British parents were feeling the same fears, the same\nsense of being trapped, and the same desire to scream. That\u2019s why their simple\ncall to join their WhatsApp group \u201cwent nuts.\u201d Clare Fernyhough and Daisy\nGreenwell tell their story below. I reached out to them as soon as I read the\narticle, and together, we put on a public Zoom call for British parents on\nMarch 21. We had over one thousand people on the call, discussing the\nchallenges we faced and the power we had to change things as our numbers\nswelled.\n\nBy the end of the call, it was clear: The UK reached its tipping point in\nFebruary 2024. Parents are up in arms about what addictive, distracting, and\nomnipresent digital technology is doing to their children at home and at\nschool. They\u2019re not going to take it anymore. I hope you\u2019ll read their essay\nbelow and then join them. Sign up to take action. The two most important sites\nfor British parents are Smartphonefreechildhood.co.uk, which is the site that\nDaisy and Clare created, and also DelaySmartphones.org.uk, created by Hannah\nOertel.\n\nAmerican parents and parents everywhere: Let\u2019s do it too! Let\u2019s unite the way\nBritish parents have. Let\u2019s change norms and laws. Let\u2019s roll back the phone-\nbased childhood now! For American parents, please start by signing up at our\nsite, AnxiousGeneration.com. At the bottom of the page, you can sign up for\nour mailing list, and also find links to dozens of other excellent\norganizations, including some in Spain, France, and Australia.\n\nOne important note about ages: In the four norms I\u2019m promoting to roll back\nthe phone-based childhood, norm #2 is \u201cno smartphones before high school.\u201d In\nthe U.S., students generally move from middle school to high school (or\nsecondary school) in 9th grade, around the age of 14. It is vital to keep\nmiddle school clear of phone-based life, which is why I picked high school as\nthe best \u201cbright line\u201d to serve as a universal minimum age. But in the UK, age\n14 falls right in the middle of their secondary school, which runs roughly\nfrom ages 12-16, so it would be terrible to flood secondary schools with\nphones just for the older kids. The line would not hold at 14; it would drop\nto 12. Therefore, in the UK (as in Spain and other countries), the bright line\nis after secondary school, which is around the age of 16. Daisy and Clare\nproposed 16 as a more ambitious minimum age, and it seems to be working. In\nfact, two-thirds of British parents support keeping smartphones away from\nchildren under the age of 16, according to a recent survey.\n\nAnd now, here is Daisy and Clare\u2019s story, as told by Daisy:\n\nTwo months ago, I wrote a post on Instagram about not wanting to give my\n8-year-old daughter a smartphone, as one by one, kids in her class were\nstarting to get them. It was an impossible choice: hand my daughter a portal\nin her pocket to the anxiety machine that is social media (in addition to\nporn, cyberbullying, and the host of other things kids can find and experience\nonline) or to socially ostracise her from all of her peers who would gradually\nbegin spending more and more of their time on their devices.\n\ndaisygreenwell\n\nA post shared by @daisygreenwell\n\nImage. Daisy\u2019s viral instagram post, which shows her three kids, aged 4, 6 and\n8\n\nAt the time, my daughter was already a \u201clate adopter.\u201d In the UK, 24% of\n5-7-year-olds own a smartphone. By age 12, just about everyone (97%) owns one.\nA few days before that post, my friend Clare Fernyhough and I had started a\nWhatsApp group called Parents United for a Smartphone Free Childhood, in an\nattempt to support each other in holding back the digital tide. We were\ninspired by a group started by a mum worried about smartphones in Barcelona\nwhich had gone viral a few months earlier. We assumed it would just be the two\nof us and any friends we could rope in, but within hours of my post, thousands\nof parents across the UK had joined us. We were not alone.\n\nDaisy texts Clare an article about a mum in Barcelona whose WhatsApp group to\ndelay smartphones goes viral, and they decide to start their own\n\nThe WhatsApp group is born.\n\nShare\n\n###\n\nAn explosion of parental concern\n\nThe WhatsApp group size limit is 1024, so we quickly maxed out and had to get\ncreative. We suggested that people start county-level communities so that they\ncould find like-minded parents in their neighborhoods. Within days, there was\na Smartphone Free Childhood community in every county in Britain, and people\nbegan starting groups within those counties for their schools or to gather\nparents together at a hyperlocal level. By the end of that first week, there\nwere 10,000 people and 75 communities, with hundreds of school groups within\nthem.\n\nImage. From left: a parent shares his wish that he\u2019d been stricter on the\nissue of smartphones; two weeks after we launched, the first set of parents on\nthe group to make a parent pact describe how they did it; a parent shares how\nher child came back to her after she removed her smartphone.\n\nAlthough these thousand-person WhatsApp groups were pretty chaotic, the\natmosphere was euphoric, with a collective sense of relief. It was clear that\nmost parents felt lost and were desperate for support. Before long, we began\nto sink under a tidal wave of interest, questions, offers, and advice, so my\nhusband, Joe Ryrie, who builds brands for startups, joined our kitchen table\nmovement and we began the process of setting up an official organization.\n\nImage. Cofounders Daisy Greenwell and Joe Ryrie, left, Clare Fernyhough,\nright.\n\n###\n\nThe birth of a grassroots parent movement\n\nThe next phase in our journey led us to start speaking to experts and writing\ntoolkits that would help people navigate making pacts in their schools not to\nget smartphones. We formed a working group of teachers from our community,\nfiguring out how to shift the dial within the education system. A second\nworking group, all experts on the machinations of government, set their sights\non how to protect our children through better regulation of big tech.\n\nThe energy and goodwill of all involved was deeply moving. We had accidentally\ntapped into a huge groundswell of emotion\u2014love, concern, anger,\ndetermination\u2014and it led to the world\u2019s first grassroots parents movement to\nprotect childhood from smartphones. In our first two months of operation,\n75,000 parents have joined us in the UK, with requests streaming in from\nparents across the globe, from Nigeria to Japan, asking if they can start SFC\nin their countries.1\n\nWe soon came across the many and varied organizations that have been working\non this issue for years, driving forward regulation in the form of Britain\u2019s\nworld-leading but still insufficient Online Safety Act.2 We also met others\nleading the charge amongst parents\u2014people like Hannah Oertel, an Edinburgh mum\nwho has devised an effective way of getting even the most hard-to-persuade\nparents to delay giving their child a device.\n\nHannah quit her job a year ago to launch Delay Smartphones, having spent\nmonths compiling data, researching the many alternatives to smartphones, and\ninterviewing parents on the ground. Thousands of people have now signed her\nnationwide pledge to delay smartphones, and she\u2019s training parents to be\nambassadors in their school communities, educating others on the dangers of\nthese devices and the alternative minimal phones they can give their kids\ninstead. Having clued-up, determined people on the ground spreading the\nmessage in Britain\u2019s 20,000 primary schools is an invaluable tool\u2014particularly\nin areas where parents are less engaged on the issue and need hard facts to\nswing their support.\n\n###\n\nStarting a National Conversation\n\nWhat made this issue move from a fringe discussion to one being discussed at\nevery table\u2014from the kitchen to the classroom to the cabinet\u2014in a matter of\nmonths?\n\nIn the UK, a kaleidoscope of things happened all at once, driving the issue to\nboiling point:\n\nThe launch of The Anxious Generation, now at No.1 in the UK hardback\nbestseller charts, and Haidt\u2019s global campaign to bring together organizations\nworking to \u2018free the anxious generation\u2019. The campaign of Esther Ghey, a\nmother whose child was murdered by two teenagers who viewed hours of violent\ncontent on the dark web. A poll by the national parent-teacher association\ncharity Parentkind found that 77% of primary school parents support a ban on\nsmartphones. Millions of column inches in media outlets spanning the political\ndivide, asking why more isn\u2019t being done to protect childhood from addictive\nalgorithms.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting that our government is listening. The Prime Minister\u2019s office at\nNo.10 Downing Street invited us to a meeting to discuss the issues, and they\nshared our concerns. It\u2019s been widely reported that they are planning to\nlaunch a consultation exploring what more can be done to protect children.\n\nThe three things we would like the government to do are as follows:\n\n  * Force the social media platforms to comply with UK law by removing the millions of under 13 year olds from their sites (38% of 5-7 year olds in the UK use social media).\n\n  * Raise the minimum age restriction on social media platforms to 16. Until the tech companies can prove their apps are safe for children, children should not be on them.\n\n  * Mandate that children under 16 are not allowed unrestricted smartphones. Do so by creating a new market opportunity: a compulsory category of under 16 phones and app stores, neither of which allow access to algorithm-driven apps or open web browsers.\n\nWe have reached a tipping point in the UK. People are aware that something is\ndeeply wrong. Parents aren\u2019t able to bring up their children in the way that\nthey want. We don\u2019t need longitudinal peer-reviewed studies to tell us what we\ncan see before our eyes. Our children are suffering. Anxiety, addiction, and\nanorexia are unfolding in our homes and schools.\n\nThis is a deeply personal issue\u2014it\u2019s in the heart of every home and it crosses\npolitical and socioeconomic divides. This rare blossoming of consensus means\nthat the chance to finally protect childhood from smartphones is within our\ngrasp. Alongside Delay Smartphones, we will continue building an army of\nparents to put pressure on our politicians to be pioneers, leading the way for\nthe rest of the world.\n\nWays to Join the Movement:\n\n  * Join the Smartphone Free Childhood movement via https://smartphonefreechildhood.co.uk/join and follow us on Instagram and LinkedIn\n\n  * If you want to start a Smartphone Free Childhood group in your country, join our global webinar on 2nd May at 8:30 pm BST.
