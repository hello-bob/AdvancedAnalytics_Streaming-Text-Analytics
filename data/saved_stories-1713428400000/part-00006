Which such an enormous\namount of trash to transport, we\u2019re still verifying the total amount \u2013 follow\n@theoceancleanup to find out in the coming days if it\u2019s our biggest so far.\n\nTo watch this video, you need to .\n\nFor more info, check our cookie policy .\n\nInterceptor 006 is located in the Rio Las Vacas, around 16 km north of\nGuatemala City. The Rio Las Vacas is a tributary of the Rio Motagua \u2013 one of\nGuatemala\u2019s main waterways and a significant contributor to plastic emissions\ninto the Gulf of Honduras and the Caribbean Sea. Waste management challenges\nmean municipal and sanitary waste from Guatemala City is washed into the Rio\nLas Vacas during heavy rains, with this waste then flowing into the Rio\nMotagua and towards the coast. Prior to our deployment, it was estimated that\nup to 20 million kilograms of plastic waste was emitted from the Rio Motagua\ninto the ocean, each year: much of it via the Rio Las Vacas.\n\nAfter trash is removed from the Interceptor Barricade using excavators, it is\nweighed on-site to determine the total catch quantity and passed to local\npartners and waste management authorities for processing.After trash is\nremoved from the Interceptor Barricade using excavators, it is weighed on-site\nto determine the total catch quantity and passed to local partners and waste\nmanagement authorities for processing.After trash is removed from the\nInterceptor Barricade using excavators, it is weighed on-site to determine the\ntotal catch quantity and passed to local partners and waste management\nauthorities for processing.After trash is removed from the Interceptor\nBarricade using excavators, it is weighed on-site to determine the total catch\nquantity and passed to local partners and waste management authorities for\nprocessing.After trash is removed from the Interceptor Barricade using\nexcavators, it is weighed on-site to determine the total catch quantity and\npassed to local partners and waste management authorities for processing.\n\n1/5\n\nAfter trash is removed from the Interceptor Barricade using excavators, it is\nweighed on-site to determine the total catch quantity and passed to local\npartners and waste management authorities for processing.\n\nWe call our deployment in the Rio Las Vacas the Interceptor Barricade: a set\nof two strategically located floating booms which capture plastic while\nallowing the force of the flooding river to pass underneath. The booms are\nchained to foundations dug deep into the riverside and set in concrete,\nensuring Interceptor 006 has the strength and stability needed to stop and\nretain such enormous quantities of trash repeatedly throughout the rainy\nseason.\n\nThe Interceptor Barricade is a floating two-boom system placed throughout the\nriver to efficiently capture plastic, while allowing the water to pass freely\nbelow the surface.The first boom is placed upstream with a length of 51\nmeters, and captures the majority of the plastic flow.The second boom is 107\nmeters long and placed further downstream to capture anything that the\nupstream boom could not.\n\n1/3\n\nThe Interceptor Barricade is a floating two-boom system placed throughout the\nriver to efficiently capture plastic, while allowing the water to pass freely\nbelow the surface.\n\nIntercepting plastic in highly-polluting rivers is the fastest and most cost-\neffective way to clean the oceans and is the focus of our Rivers program, as\nwe look to stop plastics from reaching the ocean. Our network of Interceptors\nis maturing around the world: our first prototype Interceptor 001 recently\ncelebrated 5 years since deployment in Indonesia. We have also recently\nannounced the arrival of Interceptor 019 in Bangkok, Thailand and a new\npartnership in India, starting in Mumbai.\n\nWith over 9 million kilograms of trash extracted from rivers globally to date,\nalongside our recent return to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, we continue to\nadvance our mission in both oceans and rivers. We are encouraged by this\npositive start to 2024 and expect to see our catch total increase dramatically\nthis year.\n\nBoyan Slat, Founder and CEO of The Ocean Cleanup, on location at the Rio Las\nVacas.Boyan Slat, Founder and CEO of The Ocean Cleanup, on location at the Rio\nLas Vacas.\n\n1/2\n\nBoyan Slat, Founder and CEO of The Ocean Cleanup, on location at the Rio Las\nVacas.\n\nInterceptor 006 has had unprecedented impact in Guatemala \u2013 and is kicking off\n2024 in encouraging style. We look forward to learning just how massive this\ntrash flood was and continuing to optimize Interceptor 006 to catch much more\nduring the year.\n\nOur mission is to rid the oceans of plastic, and Interceptor 006 is bringing\nus closer to completing that mission. Stay tuned to @theoceancleanup and\nmonitor our updates on theoceancleanup.com to see our impact of our\nInterceptors in Guatemala and other rivers around the world.\n\nInterceptor 006 in the Rio Las Vacas, Guatemala, is deployed by The Ocean\nCleanup in collaboration with partners Municipality of Guatemala City,\nMinisterio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, BiosferaGT, and Aliarse.\n\n### Share this update\n\nShare Tweet Share Send\n\n### Previous update\n\n\u2039 The Ocean Cleanup Returns to Great Pacific Garbage Patch for Most Ambitious\nYear Yet\n\nFollow us\n\n  * Follow us on Instagram\n  * Follow us on Facebook\n  * Follow us on Twitter\n  * Follow us on Youtube\n  * Follow us on Linkedin\n  * Follow us on Tiktok\n\nNewsletter\n\n27402\n\n", "frontpage": false}
