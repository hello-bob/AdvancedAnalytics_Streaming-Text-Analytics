For 2024,\nthough, the EPA tightened up its range testing, making it harder for many EVs\nto keep their maximum range figures. However, thanks to some clever tweaks to\nthe Air's powertrain, battery, and heat pump, Lucid was able to maintain the\nsedan's EPA-estimated 516-mile range and keep its range crown.\n\nLucid didn't say exactly what has been done to improve its electric powertrain\nor cell technology, but a large part of the work has to do with better thermal\nefficiency, helping the Air squeeze every last drop of energy from the\nbattery. One way Lucid improved thermal efficiency was by using the upgraded\nheat pump from the Air Sapphire, the triple-motor, 1,234-horsepower ultra-\nperformance EV.\n\nLucid\n\nLet me turn on my infomercial voice to say \"But wait, there's more!\" In\naddition to its diesel-like 516 miles of range, the Lucid Air Grand Touring\nnow charges 15-30% faster at DC charging stations, thanks to improved battery\npreconditioning. When you're en route to a charging station using the car's\nnavigation, it will automatically precondition the battery for charging,\nenabling faster charges. Lucid didn't provide exact DC fast-charging figures\nfor the updated Air Grand Touring, but the 2023 model was capable of regaining\n300 miles of range in 21 minutes. If the new software can drop that under 20\nminutes, customers should be happy.\n\nDespite its impressive range, the Lucid Air Grand Touring is no slowpoke. With\n819 horsepower from two electric motors, it can get from 0-60 mph in three\nseconds flat. Obviously, using such performance will have adverse effects on\nthat 516-mile range, but it's nice to have that duality: it can be an\nelectricity-sipping EV or a four-door supercar slayer, depending on your mood.\n\nIt still doesn't come cheap, though. If you want the longest-range EV in the\nU.S., you'll have to hand over $111,400. Nobody ever said setting benchmarks\nwas easy on the wallet.\n\nGot tips?
