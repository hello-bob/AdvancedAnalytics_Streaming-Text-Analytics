Suleyman\njoined Microsoft in March.\n\nGetty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n25\n\nMicrosoft is working on a new large-scale AI language model called MAI-1,\nwhich could potentially rival state-of-the-art models from Google, Anthropic,\nand OpenAI, according to a report by The Information. This marks the first\ntime Microsoft has developed an in-house AI model of this magnitude since\ninvesting over $10 billion in OpenAI for the rights to reuse the startup's AI\nmodels. OpenAI's GPT-4 powers not only ChatGPT but also Microsoft Copilot.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nDeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman will run Microsoft\u2019s new consumer AI unit\n\nThe development of MAI-1 is being led by Mustafa Suleyman, the former Google\nAI leader who recently served as CEO of the AI startup Inflection before\nMicrosoft acquired the majority of the startup's staff and intellectual\nproperty for $650 million in March. Although MAI-1 may build on techniques\nbrought over by former Inflection staff, it is reportedly an entirely new\nlarge language model (LLM), as confirmed by two Microsoft employees familiar\nwith the project.\n\nWith approximately 500 billion parameters, MAI-1 will be significantly larger\nthan Microsoft's previous open source models (such as Phi-3, which we covered\nlast month), requiring more computing power and training data. This reportedly\nplaces MAI-1 in a similar league as OpenAI's GPT-4, which is rumored to have\nover 1 trillion parameters (in a mixture-of-experts configuration) and well\nabove smaller models like Meta and Mistral's 70 billion parameter models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe development of MAI-1 suggests a dual approach to AI within Microsoft,\nfocusing on both small locally run language models for mobile devices and\nlarger state-of-the-art models that are powered by the cloud. Apple is\nreportedly exploring a similar approach. It also highlights the company's\nwillingness to explore AI development independently from OpenAI, whose\ntechnology currently powers Microsoft's most ambitious generative AI features,\nincluding a chatbot baked into Windows.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nApple releases eight small AI language models aimed at on-device use\n\nReportedly, the exact purpose of MAI-1 has not been determined (even within\nMicrosoft), and its most ideal use will depend on its performance, according\nto one of The Information's sources. To train the model, Microsoft has been\nallocating a large cluster of servers with Nvidia GPUs and compiling training\ndata from various sources, including text generated by OpenAI's GPT-4 and\npublic Internet data.\n\nDepending on the progress made in the coming weeks, The Information reports\nthat Microsoft may preview MAI-1 as early as its Build developer conference\nlater this month, as reported by one of the sources cited by the publication.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n25\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
