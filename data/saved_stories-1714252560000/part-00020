She is also the co-founder of the\nNumun Fund, the first dedicated fund for feminist tech in the Global Majority.\nEsra\u2019a currently serves on the Board of the Wikimedia Foundation, the\nnonprofit which hosts Wikipedia. She is also on the Board of the Tor Project,\ndevelopers of one of the world\u2019s strongest tools for privacy and freedom\nonline.\n\nKarien Bezuidenhout is an advocate for openness and supporter of social\nentrepreneurs. As the former director of the Shuttleworth Foundation, her core\ninterest lies in social and policy innovation through practical interventions\nand sustainable social enterprises. Through her experience as a board member\nto social change organisations and social enterprises across the world, she\nstrives to make connections that accelerate learning.\n\nAmir Ghavi leads Fried Frank\u2019s core technology practices as the co-head of the\nTechnology Transactions Practice, where he advises clients on cutting edge\ntechnology and intellectual property matters. Amir is also a regular speaker,\npanelist and commentator to the media on digital assets and quantum computing.\n\nFelix Hlatky has been the Chief Financial Officer of Mastodon since 2020.\nFelix helped Eugen by incorporating the project in a non-profit LLC in Germany\nand raising additional funds from Prototype Fund, NLnet and GLS Bank. Felix is\nthe CEO of SOLARYS, a company developing software for volunteer firefighters\nin the DACH region.\n\nBiz Stone is an entrepreneur best known as a co-founder of Twitter, one of the\nworld\u2019s leading social media platforms. Biz\u2019s career spans various facets of\ntechnology and social networking, including contributions to the development\nof blogging, podcasting, and social media. Beyond Twitter, Biz has engaged in\nvarious philanthropic efforts and tech ventures, emphasizing the importance of\ncorporate responsibility and the potential of technology to address societal\nchallenges.\n\nThe board was selected based on the values they share with Mastodon, their\nvaluable experience and their commitment to helping build and grow the\nfediverse.\n\nWith additional guidance of this Board and the incredible support of our\ngrowing communities, Mastodon will remain firm in its mission of offering\nfree, open-source decentralized social media.\n\n### Mastodon\u2019s non-profit status in Germany\n\nWe\u2019ve always been worried that developing Free and Open Source Software would\nnot be recognized as a charitable cause by the German tax system, so we were\nglad when the tax office originally approved our non-profit status in 2021.\nBut now we have received a notice from the same tax office that our non-profit\nstatus has been withdrawn. This came with no advance warning or explanation.\nEarlier this year we went through a successful tax audit, which in fact\nresulted in some favourable adjustments as we\u2019ve been paying too much tax. Our\ntax advisor immediately submitted an appeal to the decision, but so far, we\nhave no new information.\n\nWe can only guess as to the cause. Our activities have been the same since\n2016: We produce Free, Open Source Software and run a free service for the\npublic in the form of mastodon.social. We pay employees, developer and\ndesigner contractors, and hosting and service fees for tools necessary for\ncompany operation. We further the cause of decentralized, privacy-friendly\nsocial media. Our income flows largely from the crowdfunding platform Patreon.\n\nOur day to day operations are largely unaffected by this event, since Patreon\ndoes not presuppose non-profit status, and Patreon income does not count as\ndonations. We have in fact not had to issue a single donation receipt since\n2021. The significance of the non-profit status is in communicating our\ncommitment to the cause of creating social media that serves the interests of\nits users instead of its shareholders. We now have the 501(c)(3) in the US to\nfill the gap. However, it\u2019s also important for us that Mastodon is one of the\nfew, if not the only social media platform that operates out of the EU, and we\nwould like to keep it that way.\n\n### Looking onward\n\nIn summing up this round of news, 2024 has both been extremely busy and\nexciting as Mastodon\u2019s governance and legal structure evolves. We see these\nchanges as necessary developments to reach Mastodon\u2019s ambitious goals. In\nrealizing Mastodon\u2019s potential, we are deeply grateful to Jeff Atwood and\nMozilla for contributing $100K each this year to support Mastodon\u2019s growth.\n\nWe hope to continue fundraising throughout the year so we can move past simply\nsustaining Mastodon\u2019s current operational and development capacity and focus\non growth and greater impact. Most people don\u2019t realize the core developer\nteam of Mastodon is still just two people, and it is these last donations that\nhave allowed us to open a third full-time developer position.\n\nThe interest in the fediverse is unprecedented this year, and it will mark a\nhuge milestone in Mastodon\u2019s journey. If you\u2019re interested in being involved\nin any fundraising efforts or if you\u2019re a funder interested in making a\ncontribution, please reach out! We\u2019re always happy to hear from anyone with as\nmuch passion for the open social web as we are.\n\nApr 15, 2024 News\n\n### Mastodon stuffed toy coming soon\n\nDeliberately friend-sized and friend-shaped, with a soft surface material and\nsoft, squishy stuffing, you will soon be able to have a Mastodon in your home.\n\nEugen Rochko\n\nCEO / Founder\n\nFeb 28, 2024 New Features\n\n### Mastodon for Android update\n\nIn our latest Mastodon for Android release, we're making it easier than ever\nto share profiles using QR codes, among a number of other usability\nimprovements.\n\nEugen Rochko\n\nCEO / Founder\n\nMastodon \u00b7 View source \u00b7 CC BY-SA 4.0 \u00b7 Imprint\n\n", "frontpage": true}
