Not\nonly was it one of the first completed buildings to propose a new direction\nfor British architecture, it was also one of the first to demonstrate the\nexpressive and structural potential of reinforced concrete.\n\nThe inventive design of the pool was the result of a close collaboration\nbetween Lubetkin and the structural engineer Ove Arup. Together they produced\na structure that was at once a shelter for animals, an aquatic sculpture, and\nan impressive feat of engineering.\n\nThe Penguin Pool complex comprises a long elliptical pool with a deep glass\nfronted diving tank and nesting boxes around the perimeter. The design was\nbased on 'behaviourism'; this was a popular philosophy of psychology in the\n1930s that claimed that all animal behaviours were a result of external\nenvironments. The design sought to both mimic the penguin\u2019s natural habitat\nand provide a stimulating environment while also creating a theatrical stage\non which they would display themselves to visitors. The defining feature is a\npair of impressively thin interlocking spiral ramps that extend from hidden\ncolumns and appear to hover over the pool entirely unsupported. In addition to\nthe narrow curving ramps which tested the penguins\u2019 balance, the enclosure\nincluded a variety of flooring materials such as exposed concrete, slate\nsteps, and plastic rubber made of cork chippings, rubber and cement.\n\nThe Penguin Pool at London Zoo.

To realise the ambitious design Lubetkin turned\nto Ove, an emerging specialist in reinforced concrete at the time. The two met\nin 1933 while Ove was working for the Danish engineering firm Christiani &\nNielsen. Lubetkin had been referred to their London office after seeking\nadvice for the Gorilla House, his first commission from the London Zoo. It was\nalso during this time that Ove joined the Architectural Association and was\nbecoming increasingly interested in working closely with architects and other\nspecialists on cutting-edge design projects.\n\nIn early 1934, Ove joined contractor J.L. Kier & Co., another engineering firm\nof Danish origin that specialised in reinforced concrete. He joined Kier with\nthe stipulation that he could develop his professional connections with\nmodernist architects and was made director in charge of tenders and chief\ndesigner, a position he held until he left to establish his own firm in 1938.\n\nThe Penguin Pool provided Ove the perfect opportunity to exploit the potential\nof reinforced concrete. He advanced the idea that the concrete slab or panel\nwas the most effective form for reinforced concrete. This was in opposition to\nthe traditional method of casting it as a column or beam. He also proposed\nthat concrete structures should be cast as one unit with the joints as strong\nas the central elements. He argued that with this approach any shape could be\nachieved.\n\nThe Penguin Pool under construction, 1934. \u00a9 RIBA Library Photographs\nCollection. Photograph by John Havinden\n\nAside from the decision to use cast concrete slabs, there were many important\nfactors to consider when engineering the Penguin Pool ramps. These included\nthe load bearing capacity, bending, and torsion of the concrete. At 14 metres\nlong, the ramps needed to include reinforcements to support themselves and the\nweight of the penguins. Torsion reinforcement was placed diagonally across the\nramp to help act in the direction of the principle tension stresses. These\ndiagonal reinforcements were placed in both the horizontal and vertical axes\nto a sort of rectangular helix. In order to achieve the thinness desired by\nthe architects Ove tapered the section of the ramps from 15cm to 7.6cm toward\nthe outside of the ramps. The calculations for the ramps proved to be long and\ncomplex. Felix Samuely, a colleague of Ove\u2019s at J.L. Kier & Co, was hired to\nassist with the structural analysis. He also proposed the trapezoidal section\nof the ramps which allowed them to decrease in thickness toward the centre of\nthe spiral.\n\n\u2018Ovafest 90\u2019 birthday programme, 1985. \u00a9 Ove Arup Family Estate\n\nThe success of the Penguin Pool effectively established Ove as the go-to\nexpert in reinforced concrete and Lubetkin and Tecton as leading architects of\ntheir generation. The collaboration on the Penguin Pool established a\nprofessional partnership and friendship between Ove and Lubetkin. They worked\ntogether to push on the structural and formal possibilities inherent in\nreinforced concrete on the apartment blocks Highpoint I (1935) and Highpoint\nII (1938) in Highgate, and the Finsbury Health Centre (1938), among many other\nprojects.\n\n  * Share this article\n\n## Shop\n\nExplore the range of exclusive gifts, jewellery, prints and more.
