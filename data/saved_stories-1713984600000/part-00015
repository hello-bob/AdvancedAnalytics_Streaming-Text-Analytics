As we enter the second wave of\nthis evolution, preprint review communities are emerging, raising important\nquestions about how to position a document with its review and what to do\nabout metadata?\n\nThe key problem lies in the file formats used by preprint servers, which rely\nheavily on PDF, making it extremely challenging to reconstitute structured\ncontent or extract metadata. PDF is a terrible format and reconstructing\nstructured information from a PDF is as Peter Murray-Rust has famously said is\nlike \"constructing a hamburger into a cow\". The scholarly community has known\nabout the problems of PDF for a long time as attested by the beautifully named\n'Beyond the PDF' symposium in 2011 (later to become Force11) which sought to\nexplore richer and more dynamic ways to present scholarly content other than\nPDF.\n\nSo why is that, from where I sit, one of the most important evolutions of\nscholarly communications in the last decade \u2013 preprint servers and the\npreprint review/curate ecosystem - is dedicated to PDF? Ideally preprint\nservers would change the submission format, but I fear we are too late to\nachieve that across the entire ecosystem. At least I don't see that change\ncoming quickly. So what are we to do?\n\n### The Importance of Structured Content\n\nStructured content is crucial for the future of the preprint-review model. As\nthe ecosystem becomes more mature higher production values and more\nsophisticated data requirements are being placed on this ecosystem. As\npreprint servers and review communities continue to gain brand value and\nposition their content as authoritative, the need for structured content will\nbecome increasingly pressing. However, the preprint ecosystem's reliance on\nPDF files puts it at a significant disadvantage compared to traditional\njournal publishing models. Although journals often start with document file\nformats that have some form of almost-rational underlying markup (e.g., DOCX\nor LaTeX), preprint servers are in a worse position than journals by relying\non PDF.\n\nCoko has demonstrated that it is possible to mostly-automate the process of\nconverting document file formats such as docx into highly structured content\n(JATS XML). Unfortunately, this is not yet the case for PDF files, which are\nnotoriously difficult to deconstruct into structured document formats like\nHTML and XML.\n\n### The Call for an Open Source Solution\n\nTo address this urgent need, we are calling for funding to develop an open\nsource application that can deconstruct arbitrary PDF files into structured\nHTML and XML. This is not a trivial task and would require a substantial\ninvestment over an initial 2-year development period. The process however,\nwill require ongoing maintenance until the day no PDFs are submitted anywhere,\nas authors will continue to find ways of using PDF to represent content in\nnuanced ways - requiring ongoing refinement of conversion processes.\n\nWe are reaching out to the readers of this blog, who are well-connected and\nunderstand the importance of this project, to help us identify potential\nfunding sources.\n\nMany funders may not understand the significance of this project, believe it\nhas already been solved (it hasn't), or think \"PDF conversion\" isn't a very\nsexy topic, instead focusing on newer, more glamorous technologies (not to say\nAI couldn't be part of solving this issue). However, the development of an\nopen source PDF to HTML/XML converter is a critical component in the evolution\nof the preprint ecosystem and must be addressed now and for this we need your\nhelp.\n\n### The Benefits of an Open Source PDF Converter\n\nA high-fidelity open source PDF to HTML/XML converter, capable of accurately\nconverting arbitrarily formatted PDF files into structured content would\nprovide numerous benefits to the scholarly communication community:\n\n  1. Widespread adoption: An open source tool can be adopted by any existing platform.\n  2. Enhanced accessibility: It would provide capabilities to improve the accessibility of preprint content.\n  3. Efficient data extraction: We can better extract data from structured content.\n  4. Flexible display and formatting: We can display and re-format content for various devices more easily.\n  5. Content enhancement and analysis: Structured content can be enhanced and analyzed more effectively.\n  6. Improved interoperability: We will achieve better interoperability between different preprint servers and platforms.\n  7. Reduced reliance on proprietary solutions: We can reduce reliance on proprietary file formats and tools.\n  8. Enriched data ecosystem: It will contribute to an improved data ecosystem in the preprint universe.\n\nBy investing in the development of this core open source component, we can\nensure that the preprint ecosystem continues to thrive and evolve, ultimately\nbenefiting researchers, institutions, and the public at large.\n\n### A Call to Action\n\nI urge the readers of this blog, as well as the wider scholarly communication\ncommunity, to recognize the importance of this project and help us identify\npotential funding sources. Together, we can work towards building a more open,\naccessible, and interoperable future for scholarly communication.\n\n### Published by:\n\n### Member discussion\n\n5 comments\n\nRobots Cooking \u00a9 2024\n\nPowered by Ghost\n\n", "frontpage": false}
