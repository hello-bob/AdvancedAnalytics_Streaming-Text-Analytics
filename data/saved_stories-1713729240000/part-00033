Well, perhaps more than one. Or none, depending on\nyour point of view. We\u2019ll explain.\n\nThe five images (below) tease postapocalyptic scenes in major United States\ncities that have been torn apart by conflict. The Sphere is blackened wreck\namid a smoldering Las Vegas. There is a floating gun unit in a lake outside\nLos Angeles. There are troops on patrol in San Francisco. A Miami street lays\nin ruins. There are tour boats full of refugees on the Chicago River. All\nscenes suggesting war-torn destruction in iconic locations.\n\n### Related Stories\n\nMovies\n\n### Box Office: 'Civil War' Drawing Blood in Battle With New Vampire Pic\n'Abigail' for No. 1\n\nMovies\n\n### Critic's Notebook: The Compellingly Packaged Cowardice of 'Civil War'\n\nExcept ... none of these scenes are actually in the movie. They\u2019ve caused some\nto wonder if the campaign is giving potential moviegoers a false expectation\nof what they\u2019ll see in the film. Civil War is A24\u2019s most expensive production\nto date, costing around $50 million. Yet the images make the film look like a\nmovie with twice that budget.\n\n\u201cNone of this happens in the movie,\u201d wrote one reader on A24\u2019s Instagram post.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand this campaign. U are selling a movie that doesn\u2019t exist\nand it\u2019s very bizarre. I love a24 with all my heart but i am so bloody\nconfused about what happened with this film.\u201d\n\nThe other potential issue is the images are artificial intelligence-generated,\nresulting in some backlash over the use of the technology. The AI work also\nresulted in some notable geographic and landmark mistakes and a bit of\n\u201cuncanny valley\u201d weirdness. For instance, the two Marina Towers buildings in\nChicago are on the same side of the river in reality but are on opposite sides\nin the art. Meanwhile, a shot of wreckage in Miami shows a car with three\ndoors. Some believe the giant swan in a Los Angeles lake is likewise an AI\nfail, but that\u2019s probably meant to be a paddleboat \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t really\nlook like a paddleboat, either.\n\n\u201cYou know DAMN well how the film community feels about the use of AI Generated\ncontent,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cAnd the backlash [to AI generated stills featured\nin the horror film] Late Night With The Devil was more than enough to make\nthat transparently clear to everyone: WE DO NOT WANT THIS. How stupid of your\nmarketing team to even think this was acceptable. We are trying our hardest to\nfight against the push of opening Pandora\u2019s Box with this shit and here you\nare willfully ignoring everyone\u2019s concerns in that matter.\u201d\n\nThe ads were posted on Instagram and used as physical posters in a couple of\nlocations. A source close to the movie said the images help imagine the\nnationwide impact of the film\u2019s fictional war. \u201cThese are AI images inspired\nby the movie,\u201d a source said. \u201cThe entire movie is a big \u2018what if\u2019 and so we\nwanted to continue that thought on social \u2014 powerful imagery of iconic\nlandmarks with that dystopian realism.\u201d\n\nCivil War poster A24\n\nCivil War poster A24\n\nThe recent Late Night With the Devil controversy seems like the closest\ncomparison, if a rather imperfect one. The IFC Films/Shudder release used AI\nto help create some title cards for the 1970s-era late night talk show that\u2019s\nin the film. The usage received strong backlash on social media. The film\u2019s\ndirectors Cameron and Colin Cairnes defended the usage, saying, \u201cIn\nconjunction with our amazing graphics and production design team, all of whom\nworked tirelessly to give this film the \u201970s aesthetic we had always imagined,\nwe experimented with AI for three still images which we edited further and\nultimately appear as very brief interstitials in the film.\u201d\n\nIn any case, the marketing effort is certainly causing some online buzz as\nCivil War heads into its second weekend. The film from writer-director Alex\nGarland opened to a notably better-than-expected $25.7 million, a record for\nthe studio. After all the discussion of the film\u2019s politics, or lack thereof,\nit also drew an equal number of moviegoers that self-identified as liberal and\nconservative according to exit polling.\n\nIronically enough, before Civil War, Garland was perhaps best known for his\n2014 directorial debut, Ex Machina, a film that warned about the dangers of\nAI.\n\nA24\n\nA24\n\nA24\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe Sign Up\n\n## More from The Hollywood Reporter\n\n  * Kevin Bacon\n\n### Kevin Bacon Returns to High School Where \u2018Footloose\u2019 Was Filmed After\nStudent Campaign\n\n  * zendaya\n\n### Zendaya on What Serena Williams Told Her After Watching \u2018Challengers\u2019\nPerformance\n\n  * lionsgate\n\n### Original \u2018Blair Witch\u2019 Cast Asks Lionsgate for Retroactive Residuals and\nConsultation on Future Projects\n\n  * international\n\n### Cillian Murphy, \u2018Kin\u2019 Season 2 Among Irish Film & Television Awards\nWinners\n\n  * Heat Vision\n\n### Box Office: \u2018Civil War\u2019 Drawing Blood in Battle With New Vampire Pic\n\u2018Abigail\u2019 for No. 1\n\n  * The Wedding Singer\n\n### Debi Mazar Says She Regrets Turning Down \u2018The Wedding Singer\u2019 Role: \u201cMade\na Stupid Decision\u201d\n\nLogo text\n\n## WEEKLY NEWSLETTER\n\nGet the scoops first!
