This is the second instalment of this year\u2019s special, monthly\nseries on unsung materials. To stay tuned, subscribe here:\n\nIn last month\u2019s post I introduced the importance of salt. It was essential to\nthe improvement of people\u2019s food, was a major input to agriculture, and was\nwidely used for preserving food, staving off the corruption of animal matter\nas though it had entered into corpses like a \u201csecond soul\u201d. It was, in fact, a\nbasic necessity of life, which made it an ideal revenue-raiser for kingdoms,\nempires and republics all over the world. The geography of salt sources, as we\nsaw, may even have defined the contours of many states.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to appreciate salt\u2019s historical significance, however, because\nit\u2019s now so extraordinarily abundant.\n\nPeople used to worry about salt supplies as a matter of survival, or at the\nvery least of staving off economic catastrophe. Without salt, a population\nwould become weaker, more prone to disease, and ultimately die. And even if\nenough salt made it directly onto people\u2019s dinner tables, it would spell food\nshortages. Without enough salt, no fish, meat, butter or cheese might ever\nmake it to market, while livestock would be thinner and yield less meat.\nDraught animals would weaken too, becoming less able to pull ploughs or\ntransport things. All of the basic foundations of the economy, overwhelmingly\nreliant on agriculture, would be undermined. Any further use for salt was a\nnice-to-have, only made possible if it was especially abundant \u2014 even in major\nindustries like agriculture. Francis Bacon in the 1620s remarked how salt\ncould in some cases be useful as a fertiliser for grain, but had to admit that\nit was \u201ctoo costly\u201d to do so at scale.1\n\nToday, however, the vast majority of salt is used as an input to produce\nchemicals for industry, with a mere 12% used for preparing or preserving food.\nIndeed, we produce so much salt today that the second most common use of it\nworldwide is to merely dump it onto the roads of some countries merely to keep\nthem from getting icy for part of the year. Salt became so abundant over the\ncourse of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that the main problem\nincreasingly became how to find a use for it all. British salt, for example,\ncame to be exported all over the world in the nineteenth century, but by 1888\nalmost all the country\u2019s salt producers had to merge into a single company,\nthe Salt Union, closing down various saltworks to try to restrict production\nand restore the industry to profitability. This failed, however, and despite\nthe rise of new demand for salt in the chemical industries, in water\nsofteners, and for de-icing roads, the huge salt-making plants established in\nBritain in the 1970s and 80s have still never had a chance to operate at full\ncapacity.2\n\nTo what do we owe this saline superabundance? To understand, we first need to\nlook at the four major ways to get salt.\n\nIf you had access to the coast, you could evaporate it from seawater, though\nthis is only about 3.5% salt. The process involved a lot of dry, sunny\nweather, or else required a lot of fuel to burn. Or, you could try a technique\ncalled sleeching: where there were especially flat coastlines, the sea at its\nhighest, twice-monthly spring tide would have an especially long range,\nsoaking plenty of coastal sand, silt or mud with its brine. In the two weeks\nuntil the spring tide returned, provided the weather was somewhat dry enough,\nthe surface of this salt-encrusted sand, silt or mud could then be scraped\naway and have water poured through it to yield a much stronger brine ready for\nboiling. What sleeching might save in fuel, however, it more than made up for\nby requiring a lot more land and hugely more labour \u2014 as well as still leaving\nyou at the mercy of the weather.\n\nIf you were too far from the coast, you had to rely on an inland source. If\nyou were lucky, you might find a briny inland spring or lake that had been\nenriched by salt deposited millions of years ago underground. The brine of an\ninland salt spring could be much stronger than seawater, requiring a lot less\nfuel or sun to evaporate the water away. The salt springs at Northwich and\nNantwich in Cheshire, in the northwest of England, were about 16% salt - over\nfive times stronger than seawater. Those at Middlewich nearby, and at Upwich\nin Worcestershire, could be as high as 25% salt. Obtaining a given quantity of\nsalt from such brine, when compared to ordinary seawater, could require just a\nseventh of the time and fuel.\n\nHeavy rains, however, or flooding from nearby lakes and rivers, could threaten\nto dilute such sources. Control of the Sambhar salt lake in north-western\nIndia, for example, had allowed the allied Rajput kingdoms of Amber and\nMarwar, later known as Jaipur and Jodhpur, to throw off the Mughal Empire in\nthe early eighteenth century, and with the spread of the railways in the late\nnineteenth century the lake would become the entire subcontinent\u2019s chief\nsource of salt. But although in a good year in the 1880s it could produce over\n250,000 tons of the stuff, in a bad year, thanks to a floods or monsoons, this\ncould plummet to just 14,000 or even just 3,000 tons \u2014 a drop in output of\n94-98%.3\n\nFinally, if you were especially lucky, you might find the underground deposits\nthat enriched such springs, and mine the salt as a rock. Although this might\nrequire a bit of fuel and water to refine it, dissolving it and evaporating it\nagain to remove dirt and impurities, salt rock was the most energy-efficient\nsalt source of all.\n\nIf you were unlucky, however, you might find yourself in a place where salt\ncould not be made at all. We looked at a few of these in Part I, when I noted\nhow salt-producing coastal areas could often come to dominate the salt-less\nplaces further inland \u2014 I mentioned, for example, how control of the salt-\nproducing coasts meant control of the kingdom of France. There were fully\ninland examples too: how the Habsburg archdukes of Austria, with their salt\nsprings at Altaussee, Hall-in-Tirol, Hallstatt, and Ischl, exerted control\nover the salt-less kingdom of Bohemia (more or less modern-day Czechia) \u2014\nespecially after 1706, when thanks to the Spanish War of Succession, they\nmanaged to exclude competing salt from the duchy of Bavaria.4 And even when\nsuch salt-forsaken places did not come under the rule of an especially\nmonopolistic neighbouring salt-producer, their populations tended to suffer\nunder heavy taxes on salt consumption, because rulers could more easily\ncontrol and tax the salt that had to be imported.\n\nYet the most interesting places of all \u2014 one of which was to become the\noriginal catalyst for our current salt superabundance \u2014 were the kinds of\nplaces that had plenty of coastline but still struggled for salt.\n\n####\n\nBengal Blues\n\nTake Bengal, the bay region now split between Bangladesh and the north-eastern\nIndian province of West Bengal, where the rivers Ganges and Brahmaputra,\nhaving collected many other rivers along the way, all dump their waters,\nsplitting the land into a labyrinthine delta. It might, on the face of it, be\nsurprising that Bengal lacked salt. After all, the region is both warm and\ncoastal. But it is also extremely humid, making it almost impossible to\nevaporate the seawater using the sun because the air is already so saturated,\nwhile the sheer quantity of fresh river water flowing out into the bay \u2014\nespecially during the rainier seasons, when those rivers swelled \u2014 meant that\nthe salt in the bay\u2019s seawater became all the more diluted. I mentioned above\nthat on average water of the seas is about 3.5% salt. In the Bay of Bengal,\nhowever, the surface water towards the coastline is just 2% in winter, falling\nto about 1% in the rainy summer. Closer to the river delta, from whence the\nbrine was often actually taken, it can fall to under 0.5%. So not only was it\nnot dry enough to make salt cheaply using the sun; you would often have needed\nperhaps three to seven times as much time and fuel as on other coastlines to\nextract a given quantity of salt.\n\nIt was no wonder, then, that Bengal \u2014 an extremely densely-populated place,\neven back in the sixteenth and seventeenth century \u2014 needed to import vast\nquantities of salt. Visiting Europeans noted how salt from the Sambhar lake\nwas amassed at the Mughal capital at Agra, where it was loaded every summer\nonto huge boats of some three, four, or even five hundred tons each, and sent\n1,500 kilometres or so down the rain-swollen Ganges all the way to Bengal.\nHauling the boats back up against the current, even in winter when it was less\nstrong, took five times as long.5 And there was a large coastal trade too,\nwith salt imported from the places further down the Bay of Bengal \u2014 a lot of\nsun-evaporated salt was produced at Peddapalli, for example, now the village\nof Nizampatnam6 \u2014 as well as from around India\u2019s tip, on its drier western\ncoast near Bombay. Bengal\u2019s appetite for salt even stretched as far as the\nMiddle East. Merchants from India\u2019s western coast would sell their wares at\nthe isle of Hormuz, at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, and there load up on\nthe island\u2019s rock salt \u201cas ballast, and carry it to Bengal, where scarcity\ngives it a value.\u201d7 The region\u2019s demand for salt thus tied together an ocean-\nwide commerce.\n\nBengal\u2019s main salt sources in 1600.\n\nThere was, however, a source of salt that was closer to home: the small island\nof Sandwip, where by 1600 over two hundred ships each year were reputed to\nload up on salt destined for mainland.8 But this, sadly, was to be its peak.\nSandwip\u2019s struggles were to be a microcosm of the whole of Bengal\u2019s painful\nnext few centuries.\n\nAs the closest source for Bengal\u2019s insatiable demand, Sandwip\u2019s salt was a\nmajor source of revenue to whoever ruled it. But this made it too attractive a\nprize. Local lords, the Mughals, the Portuguese, and the Arakan kingdom of\nMrauk-U, in modern-day Burma, all vied for control of Sandwip, making it an\nopportunist\u2019s dream. In 1607 the island was even briefly ruled by an Afghan\nmercenary, who was then ousted by a Portuguese salt merchant named Sebasti\u00e3o\nGon\u00e7alves Tibao, who turned it into a pirate kingdom. This lasted c.1609-16\nbefore the Arakanese dislodged him with the help of yet another player in the\nregion, the newly-arrived Dutch East India Company \u2014 who, in turn, would in\n1645 also try to take Sandwip for themselves.9\n\nThe depredations and disruptions soon took a toll on Bengal. The Arakanese,\nPortuguese, Dutch, and various assorted pirates, raided its coast for slaves,\nand Sandwip became depopulated and disappeared from notice. Commerce as a\nwhole in the bay declined due to the constant struggles for power, with many\nparts of the coast becoming overgrown by jungle as the population retreated\nfurther inland, ceasing to cultivate it for rice. Those who remained were of\nthe lowest castes of all, who braved the dangerous animals of the jungle to\ncut trees and make salt. On the Bengalese coast, after decades of decline, and\ndespite all the factors that made it so costly, a domestic salt industry\nemerged.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how. Before 1600, Bengal\u2019s thriving industries and\nflourishing commerce seem to have allowed it to purchase imported salt. As\nthat declined, however, its ability to pay for such imports diminished, while\nthe overall need to feed its large population remained as pressing as ever.\nBengal\u2019s population had to get its salt from somewhere no matter what, even as\nits economy shrank. At the same time, Bengal\u2019s coastline became a lot more\nplentiful in empty space and abundant wood fuel, while labour remained\nplentiful, and perhaps got cheaper as the decline in commerce meant that\nworkers were left with fewer better-paying alternatives. So, despite all of\nthe natural factors that made salt-making in Bengal such a difficult\nproposition, by the 1670s it was forced to resort to the highly land- and\nlabour-intensive practice of sleeching.10\n\nThe echoes of this decline, and of Bengal\u2019s former wealth, were still there in\nthe 1760s, on the eve of its conquest by the English East India Company.\nArchibald Keir, a Scottish soldier-turned-merchant and salt producer there\ndescribed how:\n\n> The places where the salt is now made in Bengal are called the jungles or\n> woods. These cover a large tract of country, most of which was formerly\n> cultivated, and paid a very great revenue to the government, and that was\n> not two hundred years ago. They are now, however, from the ravages of\n> pirates, and ill conduct of rulers perhaps, become the habitations solely of\n> tigers and wild beasts, except only at the season when the saltmakers go\n> there to cut wood and boil their salt.\n\nKeir estimated that 1760s Bengal had about 130,000 people engaged in the\nvarious aspects of salt-making every year, producing some 120,000 tons of\nsalt. These workers had to live in the jungle, where they dug the salt-laden\nsludge, felled trees for fuel, and did the salt-boiling over the course of\nDecember, January or February right up until the middle of June, before\ndisassembling the whole saltworks ahead of the monsoon season, and\nreassembling it all again when the next season began. Keir\u2019s own salt-works,\nwhich accounted for an estimated tenth of Bengal\u2019s overall salt production,\nrequired so much space that it took over a fortnight to visit them all by\nboat. Bengal still imported some salt, but only really tiny amounts for more\nspecialised or luxury purposes. Otherwise it supplied itself, and seems to\nhave even exported some salt to the places further inland, like Assam and\nNepal, which lacked access to salt sources of their own.11\n\nWhat\u2019s especially striking is how long sleeching in Bengal persisted \u2014 for a\nperiod of over three hundred years, from the early seventeenth to the late\nnineteenth centuries. But then the economic and political upheavals also\npersisted, while the production and sale of salt became a lucrative source of\nrevenue for its rulers \u2014 just as it had on Sandwip, and almost everywhere else\nin India and the wider world.12 In the 1670s the salt trade in Bengal seems to\nhave been farmed out by the Mughals to an Indo-Portuguese merchant, one\nNicolao de Parteca.13 By the 1760s it was under the control of one of Bengal\u2019s\nrichest and most influential men, the Armenian merchant prince Khoja Wajid.14\nOnce Bengal\u2019s salt production became established, its rulers and chief\nmagnates thus gained a vested interest in keeping it going, raising barriers\nto competition \u2014 a trend that continued, and even worsened, when it was taken\nover in the 1760s by the English East India Company.\n\nIn quite a few modern accounts of Bengal\u2019s economic history, there are\ncomplaints that the EIC oversaw the decline and eventual disappearance of\nBengal\u2019s salt industry. It\u2019s often framed as a case of purposeful de-\nindustrialisation, as cheaper salt sources from elsewhere in India and from\nBritain itself drove the sector out of business.15 But while British\ninvolvement in salt production did have terrible consequences, the problem was\nthe other way around. The very existence of Bengal\u2019s salt-making industry was\na symptom of its seventeenth- and eighteenth-century impoverishment, which was\nmaintained and exacerbated by the perverse incentives faced by its rulers.\n\nImagine for a moment that a wealthy country today suffered a truly major,\nback-to-the-Dark-Ages kind of catastrophe \u2014 a zombie apocalypse, or a nuclear\nfallout or something \u2014 and people who had once been surgeons, engineers,\nrestaurant chefs, management consultants and a whatnot, had to all resort to\nbecoming farm labourers just to keep the population alive. This was the\nsituation with Bengal and salt-making, though it did not require a catastrophe\nof such magnitude \u2014 a fall to subsistence back then was not so great or\nunfathomable a drop as it is today. So it makes little sense to frame the\neventual decline of Bengalese salt-making due to the influx of cheap salt \u2014\nlargely thanks to railways, steamships, and so on \u2014 as a bad thing. It would\nbe like complaining, when the world eventually recovered from its post-\napocalyptic Dark Age, that back-breaking farm labour was disappearing because\nfood could be produced more cheaply.\n\nMaking salt in Bengal was a downright horrible job, significantly worse than\nmaking it anywhere else in the world at the time, and possibly ever. This was\nback-breaking work for months away from home, chopping trees and gathering mud\nin swampy, malaria-infested jungle for next to no pay. The death-rate, from\ndisease, drowning, and wild animals, was astonishingly high, at about 6% of\nworkers per season. Tiger attacks alone seem to have been responsible for two\nthirds of the casualties, though employers suspected that some of these may\nactually have been disguised desertions. Yet even when concerted attempts were\nmade in the 1790s to improve conditions, by paying bonuses to the foremen\nbased on survival rates, and investing in better weapons, boats, and supplies,\nit was considered essentially impossible to ever reduce the death toll to even\n2%.16 And that\u2019s just per season, not per year. By comparison, the death rate\namong adult slaves working on a sugar plantation in Jamaica seems to have been\nabout 0.3% per year.17 The most dangerous job in the United States today,\nwhich is logging, has a death rate of just 0.082% per year. There was a reason\nthat salt-sleeching in Bengal was consigned to those of the very lowest\ncastes, many of whom were coerced.\n\nIndeed, the salt-workers were often trapped into a kind of hereditary debt\nslavery. Employers lent to the workers in advance of the salt-making season,\nso that they could start building their houses and sleeching works in the\njungle, and begin cutting wood for fuel. But bad weather, flooding, or even\nwild animals often prevented the workers producing enough salt to ever pay\nthem back. Failure one season left them bound to return to the jungle the next\nseason, and the next, until the debt was made good. When salt-workers ran away\nfrom these obligations, or simply died, employers insisted that their families\nor even their neighbours were liable, with the debt passing on from generation\nto generation and throughout whole villages until it effectively became a kind\nof custom. Anyone who had ever worked at a saltworks was often liable to be\nconscripted again for the jungle, whether they were really indebted or not.18\n\nThe great fault of the British was not that they eventually let the Bengali\nsalt-sleeching industry die away, but that they continued it, and even\nexpanded it. The EIC\u2019s conquest of Bengal effectively marked its\ntransformation from a mere long-distance freight shipping company, albeit an\noften violent one, into a fully-fledged territorial state \u2014 one paid for by\ntaking over its lucrative monopoly on salt. The very continuance of the\nmonopoly very quickly created an unstoppable bureaucratic impulse to maximise\nrevenue, and so over the following decades the salt prices paid by Bengalis\ninexorably rose.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, the use of salt-sleeching was expanded. Many of the\nCompany officials actually wanted to make things better for the salt-workers.\nThe EIC Bengal Presidency\u2019s Governor in the late 1780s, for example, the Earl\nCornwallis, tried to ban the use of customary forced labour in the saltworks,\nsaying he would even discontinue the manufacture should it prove impossible to\ndo it without coercion. He boasted that the descendants of the salt-workers\nwould \u201clook back with gratitude to the period of their emancipation\u201d. We\u2019ve\nalso seen the 1790s attempt to lower mortality rates, which was largely at the\ninitiative of one particularly conscientious Company salt agent. And Colonel\nRobert Kyd, who established Calcutta\u2019s botanical garden, in 1788 even\nexperimented with setting up solar evaporation salt pans in Bengal (which\ninevitably failed).19\n\nBut all these good intentions were but feeble taps against the hard wall of\nstate revenue-maximisation, which entailed keeping production costs low. Well\ninto the nineteenth century, although some of the more conscientious officials\ndid ensure that salt-workers ended up with more freedom and higher wages,\ncoercion was in practice difficult to stamp out, and often admitted to be\nnecessary if more salt was to be made in Bengal. Better-paying industries like\nindigo-making were suppressed, lest they enticed workers away from the salt-\nworks.20\n\nAnd when it came to suppressing competition from other parts of India, the\nBengal Presidency went to truly extraordinary lengths. When the neighbouring\ninland province of Bihar was fully subjugated in 1781, its traditional supply\nof salt from the Sambhar lake was blocked and replaced by ramping up\nproduction in Bengal by about 32,000 tons per year.21 Indeed, salt production\nin Bengal rose from around 100,000 tons per year in the 1760s to a peak of\nsome 230,000 tons by the early 1830s.22\n\nWhen much cheaper solar-evaporated salt from the neighbouring province of\nOrissa kept on being smuggled into Bengal overland, the English in 1804\nconquered it, placing it under the salt monopoly too. And when cheap solar\nsalt still continued to be smuggled in from other parts of India, especially\nfrom the Sambhar lake, the EIC\u2019s Bengal Presidency began establishing customs\nhouses along its border so that any incoming salt could be taxed accordingly,\nto maintain the monopoly price. By the 1840s, these customs houses had\ndeveloped into a fully-fledged Customs Line of bare, raised earth, which was\nheavily guarded and swept flat after each patrol, so that the footsteps of any\nsmugglers they\u2019d missed could be spotted. The Customs Line reached its final\nform, however, in the 1860s, when it became a vast, living barrier of thorny,\nimpenetrable hedge, three to four metres high and two to four metres thick,\ninterspersed where necessary with stone walls, and punctuated by over 1,700\ncrossing points staffed by some 12,000 customs officials, stretching over\n3,700 kilometres down northern India\u2019s middle.23 (See map, above.)\n\nSuch measures were necessary if the Bengal Presidency wished to maintain its\nrevenues, however, when we consider just how cheaply and easily salt could be\nmade elsewhere. By the 1820s, the vast quantities of salt made by cheap and\neasy solar evaporation on the western coast of India, near Bombay \u2014 an area\nthat was also even ruled by the East India Company \u2014 was thought to be the\ncheapest salt in the entire world, and widely exported.24 The tragedy of the\nBengal salt monopoly, right up until it was replaced by a much lower, India-\nwide excise tax on all salt in the 1870s, was that the suffering of the\njungle-dwelling salt sleechers and the deprivation laid on the population were\nentirely needless \u2014 these were sufferings perpetrated by policy, continued and\nextended for the state and its servants alone.\n\nYet perhaps the biggest tragedy of all was the unseen one \u2014 of what a salt-\ndeprived coastal region could have looked like in terms of how it and its\nneighbours might have developed. To appreciate this, and to start appreciating\nhow our present superabundance of salt came about, we need to look north-west,\nto the Baltic.\n\n####\n\nBaltic Boost\n\nWhat do the Bengal coast and the Baltic Sea have in common? They\u2019re both\nremarkably lacking in salt. I mentioned before that on average the ocean is\nabout 3.5% salt, while at the Bengal coast it can drop to below 2 or even 1%,\ndepending on the season. But the Baltic is astonishingly fresh. Even out at\nsea it\u2019s under 1% salt, while towards the coasts it\u2019s more like 0.3% or lower.\nIt\u2019s so low in salt that in some places it can hardly be tasted,25 though I\u2019d\nnot recommend trying to drink it.\n\nLook at just how salt-less the Baltic is. The scale shown here is of 0-4%\nsalt, as measured at the sea surface, which is what\u2019s most relevant to early\nsalt-making. Source here.\n\nThe Baltic is so fresh because it\u2019s fed by a lot of strong rivers while being\nextremely shallow, with far more water exiting it than flowing in from the\nNorth Sea, and with the incoming saltwater dropping to well below the surface\nbecause it\u2019s denser. Indeed, only about 9,000 years ago the Baltic was an\nentirely freshwater lake.\n\nSo although the Baltic has fairly decent weather conditions for making salt \u2014\nit gets a decent bit of sunshine in the summer, and the weather is quite dry \u2014\nthere\u2019s just hardly any salt to be extracted from its coastline in the first\nplace. Compared to almost every other coastline in the world, it would have\ntaken about ten times as much time and fuel to produce a given quantity of\nsalt.\n\nAs with Bengal then, there was a huge prize available to whoever could supply\nthe Baltic countries \u2014 especially as it became increasingly populated over the\ncourse of the middle ages. There were a few small salt springs near the coast,\nsuch as at Kolberg (now Ko\u0142obrzeg) and Greifswald. But the Baltic\u2019s main\nsupply had to come from the salt springs of L\u00fcneburg. By about 1200, about\n50,000 tons of L\u00fcneburg salt were being sent each year down the river Elbe to\nHamburg, on the North Sea coast, from whence it could be shipped to the\nBaltic.26 One of its main customers there was the city of L\u00fcbeck, which was\nheavily involved in Baltic fishing, because it had access to a small salt\nspring at Oldesloe a little further upriver, giving it the advantage over any\nrivals in being able to preserve its catch.\n\nThe Baltic\u2019s medieval salt supply\n\nL\u00fcbeck and Hamburg were, in many respects, natural rivals. Both had easy\naccess to salt springs inland. Both had leveraged this advantage to dominate\ntheir region\u2019s fishing \u2014 one in the Baltic, the other in the North Sea. Both\nwere thus in competition for the markets for that fish. Yet they decided to\nchoose cooperation instead, extending privileges to one another\u2019s citizens in\n1230, and signing a formal alliance in 1241 that was to last for hundreds of\nyears, soon taking more and more trading cities into their coalition and\ncreating the famous Hanseatic League.\n\nOne big reason for that alliance, and for its persistence, was that geography\nhad given them a problem in common: the kingdom of Denmark, which entirely\ncontrolled the straits between the North and Baltic seas, particularly the\nshipping lane called \u00d8resund, or the Sound. The Danish kings were thus able to\nchoke off the trade between the seas at will, extorting toll fees whenever\nHamburg hoped to sell fish into the Baltic, and whenever L\u00fcbeck hoped to buy\nsalt from beyond it. The original Hamburg-L\u00fcbeck alliance thus focused on\nsecuring the overland route between the two cities, sharing the cost of\nkeeping it free of brigands. By securing an alternative route, albeit still an\nextremely expensive one, they could at least somewhat mitigate the Danish\nstranglehold over the inter-sea trade.27\n\nIn the fourteenth century, however, the Danish problem became significantly\nmore acute. At one point in the 1310s the extended Hanseatic League was in\ndanger of falling apart, as Denmark tried to conquer some of its member-cities\non the Pomeranian coast. L\u00fcbeck failed to heed the call to defend them, too\nafraid of Danish retaliation. The nascent League survived this test, but\nlargely only because Denmark could not actually afford its expansionism and\ndescended into anarchy, torn apart by its German creditors when the loans came\ndue, with the League occasionally intervening to tip the scales in its favour.\nNonetheless, by the 1360s Denmark had recovered and was again attempting to\nexpand, harassing Hanseatic merchants who tried to cross the Sound.\n\nThis time, however, L\u00fcbeck was more ready. It had developed the overland route\nto Hamburg and L\u00fcneburg much cheaper by making the Stecknitz River more\nnavigable, allowing the salt to be transported by boat for some of the way \u2014 a\nstrategic insurance policy, which significantly reducing the hit they\u2019d take\nto trade by going to war with Denmark.28 And this time the League most\ncertainly waged a war. It inflicted such a heavy defeat on the Danes that in\nthe 1370 peace treaty the League was ceded control of the Sound\u2019s\nfortifications for the next 15 years, along with two thirds of the toll\nrevenues. In effect, it had wrested control of the inter-sea trade; the\nHanseatic League had become a new great power in the region, and could throw\nits weight around in the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, and England too.\n\nThe Danish problem never quite went away, however. In the 1370s and 80s,\nthanks to the machinations of queen Margaret, Denmark became united with both\nNorway and Sweden, formally merging in 1397 into a pan-Scandinavian new force\n\u2014 the Kalmar Union \u2014 with a shared monarch and foreign policy, more able to\nresist Hanseatic influence.29 But L\u00fcbeck and Hamburg also made the effort to\nbolster the overland route that connected them: they each worked to acquire\nmore direct control of the lands that it ran through, and in 1398 opened a\ncanal to connect the Stecknitz to the Elbe, making the route fully navigable\nby boat \u2014 it seems to have been Europe\u2019s first canal to connect two separate\nriver valleys by going over a summit, making it the world\u2019s second, after the\n1280s upgrades to China\u2019s Grand Canal. Thanks to this medieval engineering\nmarvel, L\u00fcneburg salt now had direct access to the Baltic Sea, without needing\nto go through the Sound.\n\nThe Stecknitz Canal would stand L\u00fcbeck and the Hanseatic League in good stead,\nallowing tens of thousands of tons of salt to enter the Baltic when the Sounds\nwas blocked. When the Kalmar Union attempted to re-impose tolls on its\nmerchants passing through the Sound in the 1420s, the League was again able to\nwin the war \u2014 even after a series of early major setbacks.\n\nBut a looming, much larger threat to Hanseatic hegemony was emerging, as a new\ngroup hoped to make the most of the Baltic\u2019s lack of salt. More on them, and\nthe Golden Age they ushered in, next time, in Part III.\n\nP.S.\n\nIf you or someone you know is aged 18-22 and is in the UK in late August,\nthere\u2019s a residential programme being run in Cambridge called the \u2018Invisible\nCollege\u2019 after the group who in the 1650s preceded the Royal Society.

William Foster\n(Hakluyt Society, 1905), p.162, says boats of 4-500 tons, which is remarkably\nclose to Mundy\u2019s estimate.

Sinclair\n(Hakluyt Society, 1902), p.165, who adds: \u201cFor in all the lands thereabouts\n[Bengal] is no salt made, but in the isle of Sundiva [Sandwip] alone\u201d.\n\n8\n\nFr. du Jarric, Histoire des Chose plus Memorables, Volume III, Book VI,\nCh.XXXII (1614), pp.847-8. Incidentally, a lot of works talk about Sandwip as\nthough it supplied the whole of Bengal\u2019s demand for salt. They all go back to\nthis source, however, which seems to have been misunderstood. The phrasing is,\nto be fair, a little confusing, but it actually seems to say that Sandwip\nexported to \u201cthe whole of Bengal\u201d in the sense of merely being an exporter of\nsalt to all of the various regions of Bengal, not that it was Bengal\u2019s sole\nsupplier (which in any case is demonstrably untrue).\n\n9\n\nBy far the best account of these complicated struggles is S. E. A. van Galen,\n\u2018Arakan and Bengal : The Rise and Decline of the Mrauk U Kingdom (Burma) from\nthe Fifteenth to the Seventeeth Century AD\u2019 (PhD thesis, Leiden University,\n2008), chapters 3-4.\n\n10\n\nFor evidence of saltmaking on the coast of Bengal in the 1670s, see Streynsham\nMaster, The Diaries of Streynsham Master, 1675-1680, Vol I, ed. Richard Carnac\nTemple (John Murray, 1911), p.321; and Bowrey, pp.199, 219-20, 225\n\n11\n\nArchibald Keir, Thoughts on the Affairs of Bengal (1772), pp.60-70. When the\nEast India Company\u2019s servants took over Bengal\u2019s salt supply in 1765, Lord\nClive estimated it at about 96,000 tons, which is not too far off. James\nGrant, \u2018Analysis of the Finances of Bengal\u2019 [1784], in Fifth Report from the\nSelect Committee on the Affairs of the East India Company (Irish University\nPress, 1969), p.313, writing not long after a disastrous famine, estimated\nBengal\u2019s own consumption at about 80,000 tons, produced by 45,000 workers.\nIt\u2019s unclear if this figure refers to just the salt-boilers or all of the\nadditional workers required for transportation and fuel-cutting, as Keir\u2019s\nfigure does, but Keir\u2019s figures are likely more realistic considering he\nmanaged a huge saltworks himself. Grant\u2019s estimate for production by the\n1780s, including increased supply to inland regions like Assam, Nepal and\nBihar, is 112,000 tons.\n\n12\n\nBowrey, p.56-7 and p.225 in the 1670s at both Peddapalli and at Patna notes\nsalt as a monopoly of the Mughal Emperor; Master, Vol I, p.321, also in the\n1670s, notes it for the Bengalese coast.\n\n13\n\nBowrey, Vol II, p.95; this is somewhat backed up by a Venetian traveller to\nthe Bengali commercial capital of Hooghly in c.1660, who noted that its\nwealthiest inhabitants were Portuguese merchants, who \u201calone were allowed to\ndeal in salt throughout the province of Bengal\u201d, quoted from J.
