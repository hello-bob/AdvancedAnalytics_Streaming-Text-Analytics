Conscious sensations ground our sense of self. They\nare crucial to our idea of ourselves as psychic beings: present, existent, and\nmattering. But is it only humans who feel this way? Do other animals? Will\nfuture machines? Weaving together intellectual adventure and cutting-edge\nscience, neuropsychologist Nicholas Humphrey describes in his book \u201cSentience\u201d\nhis quest for answers: from his discovery of blindsight in monkeys and his\npioneering work on social intelligence to breakthroughs in the philosophy of\nmind. In the following excerpt from \u201cSentience,\u201d he challenges traditional\nexplanations for the evolution of sentience in mammals and birds, proposing\nthat warm-bloodedness may have played a crucial role.\n\nBirds and mammals have in common a physiological feature that distinguishes\nthem from all other animals: They are warm-blooded. That\u2019s to say, they\nmaintain a constant body temperature higher than the surroundings, typically\n37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) for mammals and 40 degrees\nCelsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for birds.\n\nI propose that warm-bloodedness played a double role in the evolution of\nsentience: On the one hand, it brought about changes in lifestyle that made\nsentience an essential psychological asset; on the other hand, it prepared the\nbrain to deliver it.\n\nThis article is excerpted from Nicholas Humphrey\u2019s book \u201cSentience: The\nInvention of Consciousness\u201c\n\nA quick primer about warm-bloodedness. In both mammals and birds, it\u2019s a\nphysiological state that is achieved by generating heat internally and having\nan insulating coat of fur or feathers to prevent heat loss. Fossil evidence\nshows that this capacity evolved independently in dinosaurs, the ancestors of\nbirds, and cynodonts, the ancestors of mammals, at about the same time, 200\nmillion years ago, during a period of major climatic upheavals.\n\nBeing warm-blooded is expensive. Maintaining a constant high temperature\nrequires a big expenditure of energy. At 37 degrees Celsius, the human body is\nwarmer than the mean annual temperature of any habitat on Earth. To keep this\nup, a human must eat nearly 50 times more frequently than a boa constrictor of\nequivalent size and consume up to 30 times more calories overall. Given such\ncosts, there must have been big advantages or the trait would never have\nevolved.\n\nIn fact, the advantages are several. For one thing, as temperature goes up\nvarious bodily processes actually become more energetically efficient, so the\ncosts can be partially offset. In particular, the cost of sending an impulse\nalong a nerve decreases until it reaches a minimum at about 37 degrees\nCelsius. The result is that, although the overall running costs for the body\ngo up with being warm-blooded, the costs for the brain are reduced. This means\nthat mammals and birds can support larger and more complex brains with\nrelatively little extra outlay of energy.\n\nA separate advantage is that warm-bloodedness provides a defense against\ninfections by fungi and bacteria. Cold-blooded animals such as insects,\nreptiles, and amphibians are plagued by fungal infections. But very few\nparasitic fungi can survive above 37 degrees Celsius. This means that mammals\nand birds are now largely free of them.\n\nHowever, the fact that warm-bloodedness evolved when it did, at the same time\nin both classes of animal, when environmental temperatures were swinging\nwildly, suggests that the primary advantage was neither of these but rather\nthe more obvious one that it allowed animals to ride out climatic changes and\nexpand their geographic range.\n\nCold-blooded animals not only have to stay within relatively narrow geographic\nlimits but also have their activity levels dictated from moment to moment by\nthe ambient temperature. As the sun sets, or goes behind a cloud, the body of\na cold-blooded animal such as a lizard chills and its muscles and nerves slow\ndown; when body temperature drops too far, it becomes lethargic. By contrast,\nwarm-blooded animals take their environment with them and so can be alert and\nactive \u2014 feeding, socializing, traveling \u2014 both by day and night, winter and\nsummer, high in the mountains or down on plains. The fossil record shows that\nat the time warm-bloodedness evolved many cold-blooded species, unable to cope\nwith the fluctuating temperatures, became extinct.\n\nAs Claude Bernard put it, in his famous adage: \u201cLa fixit\u00e9 du milieu int\u00e9rieur\nest la condition de la vie libre.\u201d The constancy of the internal environment\nis the condition for a free life.\n\nNow, what interests me is what a \u201cfree life\u201d means, not only for the body but\nalso for the mind. As the bodies of warm-blooded animals became more\nautonomous, self-reliant, and self-contained, I imagine their sense of self\ndid too. After millions of years in which their ancestors had their lives\nconstrained by environmental temperature, they found themselves, as it were,\nlet off the leash. In body and in mind, they were becoming increasingly\nautonomous agents, with the freedom to go where they would when they would.\n\n> As the bodies of warm-blooded animals became more autonomous, self-reliant,\n> and self-contained, I imagine their sense of self did too.\n\nI hear William James, celebrating the individuality of human minds: \u201cAbsolute\ninsulation, irreducible pluralism, is the law. It seems as if the elementary\npsychic fact were not thought or this thought or that thought, but my thought,\nevery thought being owned.\u201d But insulation as a feature of the mind will very\nlikely have begun with insulation as a feature of the body. Indeed, here\u2019s\nJames again:\n\n> Our entire feeling of spiritual activity, or what commonly passes by that\n> name, is really a feeling of bodily activities whose exact nature is by most\n> men overlooked... To have a self that I can care for, nature must first\n> present me with some object interesting enough to make me instinctively wish\n> to appropriate it for its own sake.\n\nA warm-blooded body is an object that must have been considerably more\ninteresting to \u2014 and worth appropriating by \u2014 the self than a cold-blooded\none.\n\nBut this was just the half of it. I believe the change that warm-bloodedness\nbrought about in attitudes to the body and self was about to be amplified by\nwhat was happening at the level of brain physiology.\n\nI\u2019ve said little so far about what exactly might be required at the level of\nnerve cells to generate the attractors that are responsible for phenomenal\nconsciousness. I won\u2019t pretend I\u2019m ready to provide a detailed anatomical and\nneurophysiological model. Nonetheless, if I had to suggest an evolutionary\nchange to the brain that would be conducive to establishing the feedback loops\nthat create the ipsundrum [a self-generated conundrum], it would be (a) an\nincrease in the conduction speed of nerve cells, effectively shortening the\nloops and putting motor and sensory areas of the brain closer in touch;\ncoupled with (b) a decrease in the refractory period (the time-out) following\na nerve cell firing, so that the cell can join in cyclical reactivation.\n\nWhat a coincidence then, that an increase in the temperature of the brain\nwould have been bound to have both these effects. It\u2019s a well-established fact\nof physiology that the functional characteristics of neurons change with\ntemperature. It\u2019s been found for a range of animals \u2014 warm and cold-blooded \u2014\nthat the conduction speed for all classes of neurons increases by about 5\npercent per degree Centigrade, while the refractory period decreases by\nroughly the same amount. This implies that when the ancestors of mammals and\nbirds transitioned from a cold-blooded body temperature of, say, 15 degrees\nCelsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit) to a warm-blooded temperature of 37 degrees\nCelsius, the speed of their brain circuits would have more than doubled.^1\n\nWe\u2019ve remarked already on the \u201clucky accidents\u201d that have, at several points,\nplayed a part in the evolution of sensations. If warm-bloodedness played these\nkey roles, first in changing the way animals thought about the autonomy of the\nself, second in preparing the brain for phenomenal consciousness, here was an\naccident as lucky as they come.\n\nCometh the hour, cometh the brain.^2\n\nNicholas Humphrey, Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the London School of\nEconomics, is a theoretical psychologist based in Cambridge, who studies the\nevolution of intelligence and consciousness. He was the first to demonstrate\nthe existence of \u201cblindsight\u201d in monkeys. He has also studied mountain\ngorillas with Dian Fossey in Rwanda, proposed the celebrated theory of the\n\u201csocial function of intellect,\u201d and investigated the evolutionary background\nof religion, art, healing, death-awareness and suicide. His honors include the\nMartin Luther King Memorial Prize, the Pufendorf Medal, and the International\nMind and Brain Prize. His most recent books are \u201cSeeing Red\u201d (Harvard\nUniversity Press), \u201cSoul Dust\u201d (Princeton University Press), and \u201cSentience,\u201d\nfrom which this article is excerpted.\n\n  1. The potential of raised temperature to facilitate positive feedback in the human brain is illustrated by what happens when by mischance temperature rises to fever level and the whole brain goes into epileptic seizure. In other animals, there is evidence of a beneficial effect of raised temperature on sensory physiology. Swordfish, though cold-blooded, can selectively raise the temperature of their eyes when they dive to great depths, with the result that their visual acuity increases by a factor of ten. K. A. Fritsches, R. W. Brill, and E. Warrant (2005). \u201cWarm Eyes Provide Superior Vision in Swordfishes,\u201d Current Biology, 15, 55\u201358.\n  2. There\u2019s possibly still more to this. If the attractors that are the vehicle for representing phenomenal properties are to work as we\u2019ve suggested, it will have been important for their shape to be stabilized so that the representation would be consistent from one occasion to the next. But such stability might have been impossible to achieve in a brain whose fluctuating temperature meant that conduction velocities were varying all the time. Therefore warm-bloodedness could have been the essential precondition for the attractors to become reliable purveyors of phenomenal properties.
