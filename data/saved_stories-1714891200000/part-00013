(The family spoke to The Washington Post on the\ncondition that only their middle names be used because of the sensitivity of\nthe subject and because Aija is a young child.) From the time Aija learned how\nto talk, she talked about Nina, and her descriptions were remarkably\nconsistent. Aija told her parents that Nina played piano, and she loved\ndancing, and she favored the color pink (Aija emphatically did not). When Aija\nspoke as Nina, in the first person, Aija\u2019s demeanor changed: Her voice was\nsweeter and higher-pitched, her affect more gentle and polite than what Marie\nand Ross typically expected from their rambunctious toddler.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAija sometimes told them that Nina was afraid of bad guys coming to get her,\nor of not having enough food to eat; Aija once hid a bowl of cereal and told\nher mother it was for Nina. One day, when Marie was using the food processor\nin the kitchen, Aija reacted with horror to the sound: \u201cGet the tank out of\nhere!\u201d she shrieked. Marie couldn\u2019t fathom how her daughter knew the word\n\u201ctank.\u201d\n\nIt all seemed more curious than concerning \u2014 until one afternoon in the early\nspring of 2021, when Marie came to believe that there was something more to\nNina. That day, Marie recalls, she and Aija were playing together in their\nliving room, enacting little scenes with toy figurines.\n\nThen Aija suddenly turned to her mother and said, \u201cNina has numbers on her\narm, and they make her sad.\u201d\n\nMarie\u2019s mind raced. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she asked her daughter, willing her\nvoice to remain calm.\n\n\u201cNina has numbers on her arm, and they make her sad,\u201d Aija said again,\npointing to the inside of her forearm. Then she added: \u201cNina misses her\nfamily. Nina was taken away from her family.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the words that sent a jolt of adrenaline through Marie\u2019s body,\nor the way her child said them \u2014 clear and certain, with the letter R\npronounced correctly, which Aija usually couldn\u2019t manage \u2014 but there was also\nsomething about Aija\u2019s expression in that moment.\n\nNearly three years later, Marie tries to explain it: \u201cThere was just \u2014\u201d she\npauses. \u201cThere was such deep pain there.\u201d It seemed beyond what a toddler\nshould know: \u201cThe look on her face, it was too old,\u201d Marie says. \u201cDoes that\nmake sense?\u201d\n\nIt does, and it doesn\u2019t, even to her, even now. What she knows: that her\ntoddler had never heard anything about the Holocaust, and could not possibly\nrecognize the significance of numbers on a forearm. Marie knows how this story\nmight sound, and she is exceedingly careful about sharing it.\n\n\u201cThere was just \u2014\n\nthere was such deep\n\npain there. The look\n\non her face, it was too old.\n\nDoes that make sense?\u201d\n\nMarie, Aija\u2019s mom\n\n\u201cThere was just \u2014 there was\n\nsuch deep pain there.\n\nThe look on her face, it was too old.\n\nDoes that make sense?\u201d\n\nMarie, Aija\u2019s mom\n\n\u201cThere was just \u2014 there was such deep pain there.\n\nThe look on her face, it was too old. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\nMarie, Aija\u2019s mom\n\n\u201cThere was just \u2014 there was such deep pain there.\n\nThe look on her face, it was too old. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\nMarie, Aija\u2019s mom\n\nMarie also knows that she is not alone \u2014 that since the 1960s, more than 2,200\nchildren from across the world have described apparent recollections from a\nprevious life, all documented in a database maintained by the Division of\nPerceptual Studies within the Department of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral\nSciences at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. Sometimes a child\npresents enough identifying information for relatives or researchers to\npinpoint a deceased person, but that level of specificity is elusive; about a\nthird of the cases in the database do not include such a match.\n\nThe phenomenon, with its aura of the paranormal, has long been fodder for\nbooks, academic studies, newspaper stories and dramatized documentaries. All\nof these explorations tend to orbit the same existential questions: Is\nreincarnation real? What happens after we die? How can this be explained? But\nthere is, of course, no scientific means to conclusively prove \u2014 or disprove \u2014\na mechanism that might explain how a person could recall living a past life.\n\nWhich leaves parents such as Marie and Ross to navigate an inexplicable, often\nisolating experience. Something is happening, that much they know, and so they\nfind themselves facing different but equally daunting questions: What happens\n\u2014 what does it mean, what do you do \u2014 when, one day, your child tells you they\nremember being someone else?\n\nSome of the most notable cases began with a child crying in the night.\n\nIn Louisiana in 2000, 2-year-old James Leininger would wake screaming,\nrepeating the same phrases to his baffled and disturbed parents: \u201cAirplane\ncrash on fire! Little man can\u2019t get out!\u201d Over the following year, a story\nunspooled in memories and drawings: He was a World War II pilot whose plane\ntook off from a boat, and he died when he was shot down by Japanese forces.\nJames offered names of people and places, and his account would ultimately\nbecome one of the most prominent and thoroughly documented \u201ccases of the\nreincarnation type,\u201d or CORT, ever recorded.\n\nIn Oklahoma in 2009, 5-year-old Ryan Hammons would lie awake at night and\nplead: \u201cCan I go home? Can I see my mom?\u201d or \u201cWhat happened to my children?\u201d\nSometimes, he would climb tearfully into his mother\u2019s bed. He was lying beside\nher one night, Cyndi Hammons remembers, when he said that he needed to tell\nher something. \u201cI think I used to be somebody else,\u201d he whispered.\n\nSoon after Aija told her mother about the numbers on Nina\u2019s forearm, Aija also\nbegan to wake at night in a state of agitation. Crying and pacing in her room,\nshe would say she was afraid of eyes staring at her in the dark, or \u201cbad guys\u201d\nwho would take her away, or bluish clouds that were \u201ccoming to kill us all.\u201d\n\nBy that point, Marie says, she had done more reading about children who seem\nto recall past lives, and felt convinced that Aija was experiencing the same\nphenomenon. \u201cI always tried to remain open-minded,\u201d Marie says. Ross was less\ncertain, but he agreed that whatever was happening seemed extraordinary.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn the moments when Aija seemed scared or inconsolable, her parents learned\nthat what helped most was simply to stay close. They would hold her, or sit\ncalmly on the floor, and remind her that she was safe. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to\ndo except love her through it,\u201d Marie says. Aija, who was otherwise a fearless\nand happy kid, sometimes seemed to share their bewilderment. One night, as\nMarie tried to soothe her daughter, Aija asked a question her mother couldn\u2019t\nanswer: \u201cWhy do I have these bad pictures in my heart?\u201d\n\nMarie eventually shared these stories with a few trusted friends from her\ngraduate school psychology program. \u201cThey were like, \u2018This is not normal for a\n2-year-old,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nFor many of the parents who find themselves in this surreal circumstance,\nthere comes a point when they realize that it is not a passing phase. It isn\u2019t\nthe kind of topic they can research in parenting books or casually bring up to\ntheir peers at the playground.\n\nSo they do what any parent might do when they have a question they\u2019re not sure\nhow to answer: They turn to the internet. They pull up Google \u2014 child talking\nabout past life? \u2014 and discover a search result that looks startlingly\nlegitimate. \u201cAdvice to Parents of Children who are Spontaneously Recalling\nPast Life Memories,\u201d reads the headline on the page of the University of\nVirginia School of Medicine\u2019s website, and further down, \u201cContact Us,\u201d and\nthat is how they come to the attention of Jim Tucker.\n\nAs director of the Division of Perceptual Studies (DOPS) at the University of\nVirginia for the past 10 years, Tucker has worked directly with nearly 150\nfamilies, making comprehensive records of children\u2019s descriptions of past-life\nmemories.\n\nTucker inherited this work from Ian Stevenson, U-Va.\u2019s former psychiatry\ndepartment chairman and the founder of the division that would eventually\nbecome DOPS. Beginning in the 1960s, Stevenson traveled the world documenting\ncases of the reincarnation type, publishing academic papers and a number of\nbooks about his findings before his death in 2007. Stevenson\u2019s reputation \u2014\neven among those skeptical of the topic \u2014 was that of a serious and scrupulous\nscientist, someone who openly examined both the strengths and weaknesses of\nthe cases he chronicled.\n\nTucker learned of Stevenson\u2019s research while completing his residency at\nU-Va., but he didn\u2019t become more interested until nearly a decade later. After\nnine years in private practice as a child psychiatrist, Tucker married a\nclinical psychologist who was curious about reincarnation, telepathy and near-\ndeath experiences. \u201cThat opened me up a little,\u201d Tucker says, and in 1996 he\nbegan assisting Stevenson with a study of people who had had near-death\nexperiences. Since joining the School of Medicine full time in 2000, Tucker\nhas split his focus between DOPS and his work as a clinician and professor of\npsychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences.\n\nStevenson\u2019s ideas faced no shortage of criticism from the scientific\ncommunity: Some maintain that consciousness is generated by the brain and\ntherefore cannot survive beyond its death; others have speculated that the\nchildren he documented could be reciting \u201cfalse memories,\u201d having been\nunintentionally pushed toward a particular narrative by their parents.\n\nTucker shares Stevenson\u2019s desires for these critics to engage with the\nevidence in the case reports, and for the work of DOPS to be destigmatized;\nbut Tucker\u2019s own goal is more personal. \u201cIn many ways, I am doing this to try\nto sort it out for myself,\u201d he says. \u201cWith each case, I come in with certainly\nan openness, but also, I think, a fairly critical eye: What is the level of\nevidence, and could it be explained in other ways?\u201d\n\nCertain consistent patterns have emerged: The most pronounced and convincing\ncases, Stevenson and Tucker both found, tend to occur in children between the\nages of 2 and 6. They might suddenly describe places they have never been,\npeople they have never met, sometimes using words or phrases that seem beyond\ntheir vocabulary. Nightmares or sleep disturbances are occasionally reported.\nMany of these children are highly verbal and start speaking earlier than their\npeers. Their descriptions of past-life recollections often fade away entirely\nby the time the child turns 7 or 8.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, I am\n\ndoing this to try to sort it out\n\nfor myself. With each case,\n\nI come in with certainly\n\nan openness, but also,\n\nI think, a fairly critical eye:\n\nWhat is the level of evidence,\n\nand could it be explained\n\nin other ways?\u201d\n\nJim Tucker, director of the\n\nDivision of Perceptual Studies\n\nat the University of Virginia\n\n\u201cIn many ways, I am doing this\n\nto try to sort it out for myself.\n\nWith each case, I come in with\n\ncertainly an openness, but also,\n\nI think, a fairly critical eye:\n\nWhat is the level of evidence,\n\nand could it be explained\n\nin other ways?\u201d\n\nJim Tucker, director of the Division of Perceptual\n\nStudies at the University of Virginia\n\n\u201cIn many ways, I am doing this to try to sort it out for myself.\n\nWith each case, I come in with certainly an openness, but also,\n\nI think, a fairly critical eye: What is the level of evidence,\n\nand could it be explained in other ways?\u201d\n\nJim Tucker, director of the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University\nof Virginia\n\n\u201cIn many ways, I am doing this to try to sort it out for myself.\n\nWith each case, I come in with certainly an openness, but also,\n\nI think, a fairly critical eye: What is the level of evidence,\n\nand could it be explained in other ways?\u201d\n\nJim Tucker, director of the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University\nof Virginia\n\nThese similarities span accounts recorded around the world. Among the cases in\nthe DOPS database, about 15 percent are North American; of those, an\noverwhelming majority are from Indigenous communities. \u201cThere\u2019s no question\nthat the cases are easier to find in cultures where there\u2019s a belief in\nreincarnation,\u201d Tucker says.\n\nThe true prevalence of this phenomenon is difficult to know, Tucker says \u2014\nparticularly given that many families might not recognize it, or might\nactively suppress it \u2014 but DOPS is contacted by about 120 families per year,\nmost of whom are American. If a child\u2019s recollections are detailed enough to\npotentially identify a particular individual, DOPS opens an investigation, and\nthe case is entered into the database.\n\nBut even if a child can offer that level of specificity, sometimes parents\ndon\u2019t want to know more. \u201cThat can be the frustrating part, where you get what\nstarts like a really interesting case, but then the parents don\u2019t stick with\nyou,\u201d Tucker says.\n\nOther times, parents can be too intrigued \u2014 which can muddle potential\nevidence. If parents ask leading questions, or if children learn that certain\nstatements are met with dramatic or enthusiastic responses, it can be\ndifficult to discern whether a child is just trying to please their parents.\n\nTucker is convinced that the vast majority of families he\u2019s met are not lying\nor embellishing their accounts to draw attention. In fact, he says, the\nopposite is often true: Many parents are quite unsettled by their child\u2019s\nclaims and do not want to publicly share them.\n\nThat impression is echoed by Tom Shroder, a former Washington Post editor and\nauthor of \u201cOld Souls: Compelling Evidence From Children Who Remember Past\nLives,\u201d who accompanied Stevenson as he studied cases in Lebanon and India.\nNone of the families they interviewed, Shroder says, seemed to have any\npersonal or material motive to misrepresent what they\u2019d witnessed. \u201cThey were\nnormal people relating their experiences,\u201d he says. And what they were\ndescribing of their children, he says, \u201cis so clearly not normal imaginative\nbehavior.\u201d\n\nTovah Klein, a leading child development psychologist and author who directs\nthe Barnard College Center for Toddler Development in New York, confirms that\nassertion.\n\nShe explained that at age 2 or 3, children engage in fantasy play, but they\nare not likely to fabricate a statement involving their primary relationships.\nIn other words: Saying \u201cYou\u2019re not my mom\u201d or \u201cI want my other parents\u201d or\n\u201cWhere are my children?\u201d \u2014 common among these cases \u2014 is not something you\nwould typically expect a very young child to say, let alone repeat\ninsistently. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like confusion,\u201d Klein says. \u201cIt sounds like a\nreal statement. And young children just don\u2019t make this kind of thing up.\u201d\n\nWhat to make of that, then? Being receptive to this kind of message from a\nchild requires a degree of openness that might feel challenging, Klein says,\nparticularly in the absence of a clear scientific explanation.\n\n\u201cSitting with the unknown, for humans, is perhaps the hardest thing we have to\ndo,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we owe it to a child, we owe it to the family, to listen,\nand to try to understand and support them, wherever they are, whatever is\nhappening.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOn a sunny Saturday morning in late August, Tucker parks his car on a suburban\nneighborhood street in Alexandria, Va., outside the home of one of Marie\u2019s\nfriends. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we have here,\u201d he says as we walk to the front door\nof the house, where we are greeted by Marie, her friend Shawn, and Aija, a\npetite, elfin child in a Spider-Man T-shirt, her wispy blond hair tied in a\nloose topknot.\n\nWe settle inside, where Aija plays with magnetized blocks and munches graham\ncrackers, while Marie and Tucker go over paperwork for the research study.\nTucker is poised and soft-spoken, his tone calm and steady when he leans\nforward to speak to Aija. \u201cI understand you\u2019ve been talking about Nina,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Aija chirps in a sweet, singsong voice.\n\n\u201cWhat can you tell me about Nina?\u201d Tucker asks.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Aija says. \u201cShe is being me.\u201d\n\nTucker mishears this: \u201cShe\u2019s being mean?\u201d he asks.\n\nAija shakes her head. \u201cShe\u2019s being me.\u201d\n\nTucker nods. \u201cWell, one thing your mom mentioned was that Nina had some\nnumbers on her arm. Can you tell me about that?\u201d At this question, Aija lowers\nher eyes and falls silent, pressing her small body against the couch cushions.\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to talk?\u201d Tucker says gently. He is well accustomed to the\nchallenges of conversing with a small child and never pushes beyond what feels\ncomfortable. \u201cWell, I will talk with your mom a little bit about Nina, and\nthen you speak up any time you want to, all right?\u201d he says, and Aija nods.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the first things she would say about Nina?\u201d Tucker asks\nMarie.\n\n\u201cShe would say that Nina is very fancy,\u201d Marie says. \u201cAnd she also sometimes\nwould be very theatrical. That or shy. Her personality has been really\nconsistent since we started hearing about Nina.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere there things that made you think this was different from an imaginary\nfriend?\u201d Tucker asks.\n\n\u201cJust the consistency,\u201d Marie says. \u201cAnd like, who Nina was and her\nbackground.\u201d\n\nOver the next hour, Marie describes standout moments from Aija\u2019s story: How\nshe once sat down at a piano and sounded out the melody to \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle,\nLittle Star\u201d and when her parents reacted with surprise, she said, \u201cNina\ntaught me how to do that.\u201d How Aija sometimes cried when she spoke of how Nina\nmissed her family. How Aija once dramatically declared to her parents, \u201cLadies\nand gentlemen, welcome to the end of the world!\u201d and curtsied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little disturbing to hear that from a 2-year-old, especially in the\nmiddle of a pandemic,\u201d Marie says with a slight laugh.\n\nTucker nods. \u201cYou kind of wonder where she even picked up the expression.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThroughout their conversation, Tucker is thorough and attentive, carefully\nrecording each detail Marie shares. At moments when Marie or Shawn become\nanimated about something Aija has said \u2014 at one point, they wonder whether\nAija\u2019s reaction to the cover of a book written by a Holocaust survivor might\nbe a sign of some connection to the author \u2014 Tucker remains impassive and\npragmatic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always clear how we should put the pieces together,\u201d he tells them.\nHe understands the impulse to identify a specific person Aija might be\nrecalling, but \u201cmost of the time, certainly in the American cases, we\u2019re not\nable to identify one particular person,\u201d he says. \u201cPresumably there were a lot\nof Ninas in concentration camps.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the interview, their discussion turns toward what the\nexperience has felt like for Aija and her family. Marie talks about how\nthey\u2019ve neither prompted nor discouraged Aija from talking about Nina,\nresponding instead with a neutral openness. Tucker nods approvingly.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that this stuff almost always fades, and will often\ndisappear, and hopefully over the next year or two you\u2019ll be hearing less and\nless about Nina,\u201d Tucker says. The more Aija becomes fully involved in this\nlife, he says, the more Nina will recede: \u201cOften school helps them do that.\u201d\n\nLater, when I call Tucker to ask him what he thought of Aija\u2019s story, he says\nthat he found the family\u2019s account compelling that but there was not enough\nspecific detail to continue an investigation. \u201cIt basically becomes one more\nunverified American case,\u201d he says.\n\nBut even if Tucker couldn\u2019t guide Aija\u2019s family toward a clear resolution, it\nseems he provided something perhaps even more meaningful. \u201cI felt so much\nvalidation,\u201d Marie tells me. \u201cI have been having this feeling, like, \u2018This is\nso profound; is anyone else seeing this?\u2019 And I felt like we were finally\nseen.\u201d\n\nIt made her think that, at some point, she might seek out another parent who\nhas gone through this before, someone who could tell her how it all plays out.\n\u201cI would love that support,\u201d she says. \u201cJust to talk to these parents, like \u2014\nwhat have they done? How do they feel?\u201d\n\nOver the past dozen years, Cyndi Hammons has grown adept at fielding the\nmessages that appear in her Facebook inbox, sent by overwhelmed parents who\ndon\u2019t know what to do about children who seem to be remembering a past life.\n\n\u201cAnybody who is struggling with it, I tell them, \u2018You\u2019re going to make it\nthrough,\u2019\u201d she says. Mostly, she just tries to listen and offer understanding.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve helped anybody, but I know what it feels like. I know\nwhat the fear feels like, what the judgment feels like, and it\u2019s heavy,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cAnd most cases aren\u2019t solved. Ryan\u2019s was solved. So I was very lucky.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel lucky in the beginning, when Ryan was waking up sobbing at\nnight and describing things his mother couldn\u2019t fathom: that he remembered\nliving in Hollywood in a big white house with a swimming pool. That he once\nhad three sons and a younger sister. That he drove a green car, and his wife\ndrove a black one.\n\n\u201cIt felt like living with someone who had Alzheimer\u2019s, mixed with grieving,\u201d\nCyndi says. But that someone was her small child, and all she wanted was for\nhim to feel safe and happy.\n\nCyndi didn\u2019t tell anyone at first, not even her husband, Ryan\u2019s father. Kevin\nHammons was the son of a Church of Christ minister, a police officer in their\nsmall town in Oklahoma, and Cyndi knew what he would think. For months, it\nremained a secret between mother and son. She brought home library books about\nHollywood in the 1940s so Ryan could leaf through the pages. When he wanted to\ncollect sunglasses instead of Hot Wheels, or window-shop for suit jackets, or\nlisten to Bing Crosby, \u201cthat\u2019s what we did,\u201d Cyndi says.\n\n\u201cIt felt like living\n\nwith someone who\n\nhad Alzheimer\u2019s,\n\nmixed with grieving.\u201d\n\nCyndi Hammons, Ryan\u2019s mom\n\n\u201cIt felt like living with\n\nsomeone who had Alzheimer\u2019s,\n\nmixed with grieving.\u201d\n\nCyndi Hammons, Ryan\u2019s mom\n\n\u201cIt felt like living with someone\n\nwho had Alzheimer\u2019s, mixed with grieving.\u201d\n\nCyndi Hammons, Ryan\u2019s mom\n\n\u201cIt felt like living with someone\n\nwho had Alzheimer\u2019s, mixed with grieving.\u201d\n\nCyndi Hammons, Ryan\u2019s mom\n\nBut Ryan\u2019s night terrors and recollections did not stop, and eventually Cyndi\ntold Kevin what was happening. He didn\u2019t initially accept the possibility of\nreincarnation, she says, but as a detective, he told her to write down\neverything Ryan said. Not long after, Ryan saw a man he recognized in one of\nhis library books, a peripheral figure in a photograph of six men: \u201cThat\u2019s\nme!\u201d he told his mother.\n\nCyndi wrote to Tucker, and in April 2010, with the help of a production crew\nfrom the A&E series \u201cThe Unexplained,\u201d they were able to identify the man as\nMarty Martyn, a movie extra and talent agent who died in 1964.\n\nWith Tucker and the television crew, Cyndi and Ryan traveled to California to\nmeet Martyn\u2019s daughter, Marisa Martyn Rosenblatt, who was 8 when her father\ndied. She was skeptical \u2014 but she ultimately confirmed many of Ryan\u2019s\nstatements about Marty Martyn, including some she hadn\u2019t realized were\ncorrect. She didn\u2019t know that her father had driven a green car, or that he\nhad a younger sister, but it turned out both claims were accurate. Marty\nMartyn\u2019s death certificate cited his age as 59, but Ryan insisted he had died\nat 61; Tucker found census records and marriage listings that confirmed this,\nas did Martyn\u2019s daughter.\n\nWhen the episode of \u201cThe Unexplained\u201d aired in 2011, it catapulted the Hammons\nfamily into a different realm, where their names were in newspaper headlines,\nand everyone in their town knew Ryan\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cKevin and I had professional jobs. I was a county clerk\u2019s deputy for 14\nyears,\u201d Cyndi says. \u201cWe were known in our community.\u201d But that didn\u2019t stop\npeople from telling her their thoughts: Your child needs to find Jesus. You\u2019re\na bad parent. Are you doing this for money?\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t really understand this unless they\u2019ve lived it,\u201d she says.\n\u201cEverything pivoted around protecting Ryan. I didn\u2019t care what anyone thought\nabout me \u2014 it didn\u2019t matter. I knew the truth, and I just knew that Ryan had\nto be okay.\u201d\n\nRyan is a college junior now. He doesn\u2019t remember being Marty Martyn anymore,\nand this isn\u2019t a story he shares when he meets people. He still isn\u2019t sure how\nto label what he experienced: \u201cI\u2019m open to anything,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I cannot\nsay with certainty that reincarnation is real.\u201d He says he is at peace with\nthe unknown, focused now on his future.\n\nBut he knows his mother is still searching for answers about what they lived\nthrough. Time has made Cyndi the lone keeper of those memories: Ryan\u2019s father\ndied two years ago, and Ryan\u2019s recollections have faded. \u201cIt isn\u2019t really my\nstory,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of her story now.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA few weeks after Marie and Aija meet with Tucker in Virginia, Aija starts\nattending preschool \u2014 and as Tucker had predicted, Nina\u2019s presence begins to\nsubside. Aija is enthralled with her new school and the friends she makes\nthere.\n\nSeveral months later, on a cold Sunday morning in February, Aija twirls and\ndances to a playlist of favorite songs in the bright living room of her\ngrandmother\u2019s house in Michigan. Her parents sit nearby, describing a\ntransition that feels, to them, like the beginning of an ending. Only months\nago, they say, Aija would speak as Nina, or about Nina, nearly every day; now,\nseveral days might pass without any reference to her. So far, Nina has never\nbeen mentioned at school, at least not to their knowledge. Aija turned 5 in\nDecember, and Tucker had told Marie that past-life recollections often begin\nto fade around this age.\n\nAs a family, they\u2019ve been reflecting on their experience recently. Marie feels\ncertain that Nina is some sort of distinct entity, that Aija carries memories\nthat aren\u2019t her own. Ross\u2019s mother \u2014 whom Ross describes as \u201cmore\nconservative\u201d \u2014 is convinced that Nina is just an imaginary friend, like the\nones Ross used to conjure when he was a small boy. Ross says he understands\nthe human impulse to name something so mystifying, but he doesn\u2019t share that\nneed. \u201cThe mystery \u2014 I can observe it, but I don\u2019t need to define it,\u201d he\nsays.\n\nMonths have passed since Aija described the frightening imagery that once\ndefined her night terrors, and Marie says she would be profoundly relieved if\nthose episodes never returned. \u201cYou never want to see your child suffer,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cI hope she never has dreams of that intensity again.\u201d\n\nYet Nina has also been a source of joy for Aija \u2014 a companion of sorts, whose\npresence has infused moments of her early childhood with a gentle, delicate\ncharm. That, too, is beginning to recede, which feels more poignant to Marie:\n\u201cThere is a kind of nostalgia, already.\u201d\n\nRoss nods in understanding. But he feels more at peace with the ebbing of\nNina\u2019s influence, he says; it seems to mirror so much of parenthood, the\nconstant movement from one uncharted landscape to the next. \u201cThe disappearance\nof it feels like part of the natural progression,\u201d he says. As a family, they\nhave learned to stay open to whatever comes.\n\nMarie lifts her phone to select a new song to play, and Aija raises her arms\ninto position for her next dance. She looks at her parents and grins. \u201cAre you\nready?\u201d she asks.\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n", "frontpage": true}
