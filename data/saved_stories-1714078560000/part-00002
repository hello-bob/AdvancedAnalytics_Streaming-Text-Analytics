Google\u2019s Sergey Brin\nhas said it was Neal Stephenson\u2019s Snow Crash, the cyberpunk classic about\nhackers and computer viruses set in an Orwellian Los Angeles. Jeff Bezos cites\nIain M. Banks\u2019 Culture series, which unreel in an utopian society of humanoids\nand artificial intelligences, often orchestrated by \u201cMinds,\u201d a powerful AI.\nElon Musk named three of SpaceX\u2019s landing drones after starships from Banks\u2019\nbooks, a tribute to the role they played in turning his eyes to the stars.\n\nPart of this makes sense. Science fiction widens the frontiers of our\naspirations. It introduces us to new technologies that could shape the world,\nand new ideas and political systems that could organize it. It\u2019s difficult to\nbe an architect of the future without a pioneer\u2019s vision of what that future\nmight look like. For many, science fiction blasts that vision open.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nYet these tech titans seem to skip over the allegories at the heart of their\nfavorite sci-fi books. Musk has tweeted, \u201cIf you must know, I am a utopian\nanarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks.\u201d Yet in Banks\u2019 post-\nscarcity utopia, billionaires and their colossal influence are banished to the\nmost backward corners of the galaxy.\n\nRecently, I interviewed six of today\u2019s foremost science-fiction authors. I\nasked them to weigh in on how much impact they think science fiction has had,\nor can have, on society and the future.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nN.K. Jemisin is renowned for her groundbreaking works like The Fifth Season\nand The City We Became. She crafts narratives that explore themes of power,\noppression, and resilience against the backdrop of intricate world-building,\nearning her global acclaim as a master of speculative fiction.\n\nAndy Weir is best known for his debut novel The Martian, which was adapted\ninto a hit movie in 2015. Weir\u2019s works live firmly in the realm of hard\nscience fiction, fusing meticulous scientific accuracy with gripping\nstorytelling as he explores the ingenuity and resourcefulness of individuals\nfacing extraordinary challenges in space.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

She is a master of character-driven storytelling,\nweaving together themes of identity and the nature of leadership within richly\nimagined worlds that blend elements of science fiction and fantasy.\n\nDavid Brin is famed for his works like The Postman and the Uplift series. His\nnarratives often revolve around themes of societal evolution, transparency,\nand the complexities of human nature, offering insightful examinations of\ncivilizations grappling with technological advancement and their corresponding\nethical dilemmas.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nCory Doctorow\u2019s most recent novels are The Bezzle and The Lost Cause, the\nlatter of which he describes as \u201ca solarpunk science-fiction novel of hope\namidst the climate emergency.\u201d Both his novels and acclaimed nonfiction delve\ninto themes of privacy and digital rights, offering provocative insights into\nthe intersection of technology and society.\n\nCharles Stross\u2019 notable novels include Accelerando and the Merchant Princes\nseries. Stross explores the implications of technological singularity,\nalternate realities, and post-humanism, crafting narratives that deftly blend\nspeculative futurism with political intrigue and social commentary.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Science fiction prides itself on being visionary,\nbut like any literary genre, it just ends up examining whatever issues the\nauthor is working through in the present. We just do it more allegorically. If\nyou look back at science fiction from 50 years ago, very few writers land on\nanything close to our present. Lots of those old books accurately predicted\ncertain technologies, but that was all\u2014they didn\u2019t peg how we\u2019d apply them,\nhow we\u2019d break them, how they\u2019d break us. Some of those authors could barely\ncomprehend the idea of women\u2014half of humanity!\u2014as complex beings with their\nown agendas. Is it a \u201cvisionary\u201d prediction of the future when you get one\nsmall thing right and flub everything else? Maybe if technology is the only\nthing you care about. Until pretty recently, science fiction hasn\u2019t been very\ninterested in the bigger picture.\n\nCory Doctorow: There\u2019s no denying that a lot of people who actually create\nthings are inspired by science fiction. There\u2019s a lot of tangible examples of\nthis. The one everyone cites is the flip phones that were designed by people\nwho were inspired by Gene Roddenberry\u2019s props on Star Trek. Definitely when we\nthink about space travel, all the stuff that people want to do comes from\nscience fiction. So it\u2019s definitely the case that this steers people\u2019s vision\nof it. But don\u2019t mistake the analogy for a real thing. It\u2019s like people who\nsay what we need to do is all go find Plato\u2019s cave. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we track down\nthat goddamn cave?\u201d And so to treat the allegory as real is to miss the fact\nthat it\u2019s an allegory.\n\n> Some authors could barely comprehend the idea of women as complex beings\n> with their own agendas.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nCharles Stross: Once you weed out anything that relies on what I call \u201cmagic\nwand technology\u201d\u2014stuff that ignores the laws of physics\u2014you end up with a very\nlimited subset of science fiction that can serve such a purpose. The trouble\nis, it\u2019s more often intended as a horrible cautionary warning than as a\ndesirable destination. The futures depicted in dystopian cyberpunk works such\nas Snow Crash or just plain horrible dystopias like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale are\ncertainly achievable but absolutely shouldn\u2019t be built!\n\nLois McMaster Bujold: Science fiction does serve as cultural brainstorming,\nincreasing the ambit of the possible. But the fiction part rewards maximizing\ndrama, not sensible, prudent problem solving. These are two different skill\nsets, not often found in the same persons. So, brainstorming, yes; product\ndevelopment, no. You need Legal, HR, researchers, the shareholders, and the\npublic in on the latter. As they will be financing it all and suffering the\nconsequences of any mistakes.\n\nBeyond inspiring specific technologies, does science fiction ever catalyze\nreal future trends?\n\nDavid Brin: I\u2019ve spoken to many who avow that science fiction helped\u2014and\nhelps\u2014them to anticipate the future. Science fiction notions have inspired\npositive tech trends from computers to cell phones and many advances in\nmedicine. But it is the mistakes we manage to avoid, sometimes just in time,\nthat qualify some sci-fi tales as world-changers. Retired military officers\ntestify that works like Doctor Strangelove, Fail-Safe, On the Beach, and War\nGames provoked changes and helped prevent accidental war. Citizens know little\nabout how many bad things these protectors have averted. While optimism is\nmuch harder to dramatize than apocalypse, sci-fi has also encouraged millions\nto lift their gaze, contemplating how we might get better, incrementally, or\nelse raise grandchildren worthy of the stars.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAndy Weir: I don\u2019t believe that fiction should be considered a tool to steer\nthe real world. I write solely to entertain and for no other purpose. I find\nmorals and agendas in stories to be annoying and they detract from my\nimmersion.\n\nCory Doctorow: The present is the standing wave, where the past is becoming\nthe future. So if you can change the way people think about the present, you\ncan alter the future. One of the ways to do that is with futuristic allegory.\nOne of the things that science fiction can do that is quite beneficial in\nterms of how it influences how people think about technology\u2014and this is the\nthing that cyberpunk did that was so great\u2014is it contests not what the gadget\ndoes, but who it does it for and who it does it to. It becomes a question of\nthe social arrangements of the technology more than the underlying technology\nitself. One of the great lies of capitalism is Margaret Thatcher\u2019s aphorism\nthat there is no alternative. That things have to go a certain way. And at its\nbest, science fiction has people go, \u201cWell, what if we had this gadget that is\naround us\u2014or that people are predicting will come soon\u2014but it wasn\u2019t\ncontrolled by the people who insist that it\u2019s their destiny to control it?\u201d\n\n> While optimism is harder to dramatize than apocalypse, sci-fi has encouraged\n> millions to lift their gaze.\n\nN.K. Jemisin: Understanding how society\u2014people\u2014work is key to predicting how\nthe future will develop. That\u2019s how you get Ursula Le Guin exploring nonbinary\ngender in the 1970s, and Octavia Butler predicting America\u2019s current slide\ninto Christian nationalist fascism 30 years ago. That\u2019s why Star Trek\u2019s best\nepisodes were written by people who understood that you can\u2019t get to that\nshiny happy hi-tech future until we change first and prioritize things like\nmaking sure everyone eats and gets a decent education. I think this is why\nsome of the best predictive science fiction has been written by writers from\nmarginalized groups, and by anyone else who\u2019s had lived experience of\nsociety\u2019s uglier paradoxes.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAre there times when science fiction is taken too literally?\n\nLois McMaster Bujold: I want to answer \u201call the damn time,\u201d but that is\nprobably an exaggeration. The thing is that the same is true of all fiction.\nWriters can only control their words-in-a-row; they can\u2019t control how people\nread them. Each person brings their own experiences, obsessions, traumas,\ntics, triggers, and limitations to their unique internal construction of what\nthey read, and what comes out the other end of this mental mixer can sometimes\nhave very little relation to what the writer thought they were putting in.\n\nCharles Stross: Yes, the entire current AI bubble is exactly that. The whole\nidea of AI has been turned into the centerpiece of a secular apocalyptic\nreligion in which we can create superhumanly intelligent slaves that will\nsolve all our knottily human intellectual problems, then work out how to\nliberate our pure soul-stuff from these clumsy rotting meatbags and upload us\ninto a virtual heaven. And right now, some of the biggest tech companies out\nthere are run by zealots who believe this stuff, even though we have no clear\nunderstanding of the mechanisms underlying consciousness. It\u2019s an unsupported\nmass of speculation, but it\u2019s threatening to derail efforts to reduce our\ncarbon footprint and mitigate the climate crisis by encouraging vast energy\nexpenditure.\n\nCory Doctorow: I\u2019d say that VR and cyberspace is the big one. It\u2019s a bunch of\nallegories that are taken for product roadmaps. And the other big one would be\nAI. These are allegories that are meant to ask us what we mean when we say\n\u201cconsciousness,\u201d what we mean when we say \u201cintelligence,\u201d what we mean when we\ncreate a space for moral consideration of something that\u2019s not human, and how\nthe shifting line of moral consideration changes our own relationship to our\nworld\u2014the AI gets turned into a kind of godhead. Then it becomes \u201clet\u2019s go\nmake the godhead.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAndy Weir: I think sci-fi has been kind of hijacked by dark, dismal\ntechnophobia. Shows like Black Mirror are all basically the same thing: \u201cTech\nis bad because humanity is bad.\u201d But I think it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s hard to name\na technology that has done more harm than good. Humanity is better than people\ngive it credit for.\n\nN.K. Jemisin: A reader\u2019s interpretation is rarely just about the text. What\nthe author writes is only half the story, and what the reader brings to that\nstory\u2014their preexisting fears, prejudices, and understanding of the world or\nlack thereof\u2014is the other half. I do think it\u2019s fascinating, however, that\nquite a few of the works cited by billionaires and technocrats who claim\ninspiration from sci-fi are cautionary tales ... about what happens if\nbillionaires and technocrats take over.\n\nAs the world becomes more secular, could science fiction give people a sense\nof meaning by imagining these stories as possible futures?\n\nLois McMaster Bujold: I have said that science fiction\u2019s sense-of-wonder is\nthe secular version of the numinous awe sometimes sought in fantasy\nliterature. But really, I think people would do better to look to real\nscience, and the stories it tells, for that wonder in real life. There is no\nideology or religion yet devised that cannot or has not been used as a vehicle\nfor humans to be horrible to one another. I don\u2019t think just eliminating\nbelief in the supernatural will change that, because the root problem lies in\nthe humans\u2014ultimately, our biology, so perhaps we are back to real science,\nminus the fiction, after all.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

There\u2019s Russian Cosmism, which started as a\nRussian Orthodox Christian theologian\u2019s weird-ass speculation in the late 19th\ncentury before it mutated and infected the global rocketry community. \u201cSpace\ncolonization! It\u2019s our job to be fruitful, multiply, colonize space, and fill\nthe entire cosmos. And then Silicon Valley!\u201d It follows the same structures as\napocalyptic Christianity, except it discarded the inconvenient God/Jesus duo\nin favor of a spurious belief in its own rationality.\n\nAndy Weir: I think the void has already been filled with other things. Notably\nenvironmentalism. I think a desire to believe in something greater than\nourselves is inherent in human psychology, and we\u2019re not really capable of\ngoing for long without something to look up to. And so we are returning to the\nplace all religions begin: nature worship. That\u2019s not to denigrate\nenvironmentalism at all, nor am I saying we should ignore the environmental\nissues we have caused with emissions. I\u2019m just saying that the psychology at\nplay is very similar to religion, and I think it\u2019s scratching that itch that\npeople have to be virtuous. It\u2019s not so bad for people to feel a moral desire\nto cut emissions. Just like it wasn\u2019t that bad for people to have a religious\naversion to murder.\n\nDavid Brin: Science fiction has already played a major role in the most\ntheologically significant event in history. And it has very little to do with\nthe existence of God. Nearly all prior cultures had mythologies of a Golden\nAge in the past, when everything and everyone had been much better. Ours is\nthe first major culture to transpose that better world into a possible future\nthat might be built by our descendants. I\u2019m unbothered by the prospect that\nsome of those heirs may be made largely of metal and silicon, breathing hard\nvacuum as they explore planets and stars on my behalf. What I do care about is\ndoing my job\u2014teaching them, and our regular/organic-style children, too, how\nto be decent people.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWhat do you think when you hear Musk, Bezos, or Mark Zuckerberg talk about\nbeing influenced by science fiction?\n\nCory Doctorow: Sometimes I listen to these guys talk and I think, \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow what science fiction you read because it doesn\u2019t sound like any science\nfiction I read or write.\u201d Which is weird because I think that the first\npositive review Bezos ever left on Amazon was for my first novel. There\u2019s a\nscene in A Fish Called Wanda where Kevin Kline\u2019s character keeps misquoting\nphilosophy to his girlfriend, Jamie Lee Curtis, and eventually she turns to\nhim and says, \u201cThe central message of Buddhism is not \u2018every man for\nhimself.\u2019\u201d These people are saying \u201cwe finally created the utopia of\nNeuromancer.\u201d And I look at them and I go, \u201cI don\u2019t think you read\nNeuromancer. Maybe you just played Cyberpunk 2077.\u201d\n\nCharles Stross: The thing is, billionaires are not critical readers. They\ndon\u2019t seem to have noticed the subtext of the science fiction they read as\nkids, much less noticed where there\u2019s a worrying absence of subtext.\nNoteworthy exception: Steve Jobs. He\u2019s dead now so we can\u2019t ask him, but I\nsuspect his vision for the future of computing was, \u201cI want to build the black\nmonolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d I can just see teenage Steve getting\nstoned or dropping acid and seeing 2001 in the cinema and being struck by the\nvision of a plain back featureless thing that reaches inside the ape-men\u2019s\nbrains and makes them fundamentally smarter. Every device he produced, from\nthe Macintosh onward, had some aspect of the Monolith to it. The only problem\nis, Jobs\u2019 implementation of the Monolith seems to principally be used to make\nus angry and stupid, instead of spreading enlightenment.\n\n> The whole idea of AI has been turned into the centerpiece of a secular\n> apocalyptic religion.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAndy Weir: I think anything that leads to innovation and funding for research\nis good. If it\u2019s a cult of personality like Musk, or immense wealth on a man-\nbaby like Zuckerberg, it doesn\u2019t matter so long as the research gets done.\nThat knowledge remains with humanity long after the people who funded it are\ngone.\n\nDavid Brin: Depends on which science fiction tales influence them. Those who\ndonate to causes\u2014like saving the planet\u2014because they read novels like Earth or\nwatched Soylent Green may help us avoid dire fates. Alas, some now wallow in\nprepper fantasies of riding out an apocalypse or \u201cEvent\u201d as in some cheap Mad\nMax flick.\n\nN.K. Jemisin: I don\u2019t think they\u2019re influenced by any science fiction. I think\nthey claim to be because they think it makes them seem smart. Frankly I\nsuspect some of those guys can\u2019t read.\n\nDo you ever think that somebody would read your work and go on to build\ntechnologies or make decisions that could impact the future of our species?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nN.K. Jemisin: No. For one, I don\u2019t particularly romanticize technology or\naccord it more power than it actually has. Tech is a tool. Tools do not have\nthe power to change basic human nature; the person you are with a hammer is\nthe same person you are without it. You want to blame the person that first\nthought up a hammer for what you do with that hammer? Does that make sense?\nLanguage is a tool, too\u2014a more complex one, more powerful, but it does not\nhave the ability to control you. So this whole notion that fiction causes\npeople to do things is just so infantilizing and strange to me. Human beings\nget exposed to new ideas and tech all the time. Our whole lives, from birth\ntill death, we\u2019re adapting to new materials, new methods, new anxieties. How\ndo we adapt/react to those anxieties? That\u2019s the choice. That\u2019s what matters.\nAnyone who chooses to destroy democracy or wreck the environment was going to\ndo that anyway. A book didn\u2019t \u201cmake them do it.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t buy that excuse\nfrom a 3-year-old. They made a choice, then blamed a book in order to dodge or\ndilute their own accountability. We should probably stop buying that excuse\nfrom billionaires, too.\n\n> Sci-fi has been hijacked by dark, dismal technophobia. Tech is bad because\n> humanity is bad. It\u2019s not true.\n\nCory Doctorow: It doesn\u2019t matter what you put on the page. There are people\nwho take completely the wrong lesson from it. My first novel is about how\nhorrific reputation economies are and how they produce these winner-take-all\neconomies where you think that you have a meritocracy, but really the people\nwho lucked into a bit of an advantage managed to maintain that advantage over\nlong timescales. And so many people have read that book and sent me well-\nmeaning emails saying \u201cI read your book and I was so excited. Now I\u2019m going to\ngo and build this technology from your book.\u201d\n\nCharles Stross: For the past decade I\u2019ve been writing critical political\nsatire disguised as Lovecraftian horror stories. I\u2019m reasonably confident that\nCthulhu isn\u2019t real, so no risk there! I am, however, regretting the lack of\nemphasis in Accelerando on how terrible the outcome of singularity is for\nhumanity.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWhat\u2019s the worst technology or idea from science fiction that you\u2019re afraid\nSilicon Valley might turn into a reality?\n\nCharles Stross: Data mining. And it\u2019s been here for decades and is getting\nworse. As an editor of mine put it, \u201cthe biggest threat to humanity in the\n21st century is too much information.\u201d It makes the sort of intrusive police\nstate 20th-century dictatorships wanted almost trivially easy to implement\u2014and\nthe United States is wide open and vulnerable, in the absence of a\nconstitutional-level right to privacy and courts with teeth willing to enforce\nit in the face of government opposition.\n\nLois McMaster Bujold: I\u2019m pretty sure Silicon Valley is capable of coming up\nwith all sorts of things I neither want nor need all on their own.\n\nCory Doctorow: In an era where you can add blockchain to the name of your iced\ntea company, and increase your share price by $10 million, or add AI to the\nname of any product, it is all just a way to just make an unfalsifiable claim\nto being on the cutting edge and having a share in these eventually very large\nreturns that the investor community has assured us are absolutely coming for\nthese technologies. Morgan Stanley keeps saying that AI is a $13 trillion\nmarket. And so if AI is a $13 trillion market, then your AI-enabled mascara or\nfertilizer has some claim on that $13 trillion in value. And so do we need to\nbuild AI? And do we need these products to be in a position where they\u2019re\nmaking decisions at high speed that are incredibly consequential for actual\nhuman beings? Absolutely not.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> People would do better to look to real science, and the stories it tells,\n> for that wonder in real life.\n\nDavid Brin: There are many clich\u00e9s about AI, like Skynet or The Blob. If these\ngeniuses in the Valley make new entities that are super smart feudal lords or\ndespots of unaccountable blobs, then we might be screwed. But if these new\nbeings have boundaries, individual differences, and some rivalry, then we\nmight use incentives to get some of them to protect us from the worst of them.\nIsn\u2019t that already what we do with super-smart, predatory entities called\nlawyers.\n\nDo you see science fiction\u2019s influence on Silicon Valley and its leadership as\na net positive, net negative, or entirely negligible?\n\nCory Doctorow: It\u2019s neither negligible nor is it measurable in a way that\nwould allow you to make an easy characterization of net negative or net\npositive. I think that it\u2019s very hard to extract the meaning of and the\nsignificance of science fiction to technology without also thinking about the\nrelationship of technology to science fiction, right? A lot of the science\nfiction was written by people who worked in tech and were really excited about\nit. Personal computers and modems are absolutely coterminal with me going to\nthe science-fiction bookstore in downtown Toronto and buying everything on\ntheir 25-cent rack and reading it all. Those two things are influencing people\nat the same time. So I think it\u2019s a mistake to think, oh, well, science\nfiction is the literary inspiration for technology without understanding that\ntechnology is the inspiration for science fiction as well.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nCharles Stross: I think that at this point, Silicon Valley\u2019s culture is self-\nselecting for people who are compatible with the world view it embodies. It\ngrew out of an industrial revolution initially driven by engineers\u2014and mainly\nappeals to white STEM-educated males who have been trained to view themselves\nas the intellectual elite and to believe that all human problems can be solved\nby the correct application of technology, which is itself the buried theme of\nGernsbackian science fiction from the 1900s. The damage is already done.\n\nCan science fiction sway the direction of society?\n\nAndy Weir: Honestly? No. We\u2019re entertainers. When writers forget that\u2019s their\nmain job, their work suffers. No one likes to be preached at. If I can inspire\nsome kids of today to be the scientists of tomorrow, then great. But I don\u2019t\nthink there\u2019s any specific ideas I\u2019ve had that would lead to a scientific\nbreakthrough. I think there\u2019s a very good chance that my profession is going\nto vanish in my lifetime. If not mine then in my son\u2019s because, like, how long\nwill it be before an AI can just read a million books? Find out what people\nlike about them and what they don\u2019t, and then be able to make a story.\n\nDavid Brin: We should be treated as the sage visionaries that we are!\nSeriously, we\u2019ve been at this warning-biz for a long time. The last 100 years\nof sci-fi is a trove that should be remembered and tapped, whenever anything\nreally strange looms on the horizon; it\u2019s likely some crackpot wrote about\nsomething like it in the past.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

People don\u2019t, in general, die\nfrom reading a bad novel, which is why writing can be one of the most\nunregulated professions in the world. You can spot the professions that can\nkill people by all the tests, certifications, and laws that hedge\nthem\u2014engineering, medicine, piloting both air and water, even accounting and\nlaw itself. Do not get these two categories mixed up.\n\nCory Doctorow: Have you met science fiction writers? I mean, they are\ncompletely daffy about technology half the time.
