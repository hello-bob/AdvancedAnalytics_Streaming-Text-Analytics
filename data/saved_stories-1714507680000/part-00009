There\u2019s also my 2007 article Cut Medicine\n> in Half where I say:\n>\n> \u00bb \u201cIn the aggregate, variations in medical spending usually show no\n> statistically significant medical effect on health. ... the tiny effect of\n> medicine found in large studies is in striking contrast to the large\n> apparent effects we find even in small studies of other influences.\u201c\n>\n> Obviously, if I thought medicine was useless at all margins, I\u2019d have said\n> to cut it all, not just cut it in half.\n\nI acknowledge he\u2019s the expert on his own opinion, so I guess I must be\nmisrepresenting him, and I apologize. But I can\u2019t figure out how these claims\nfit together coherently with what he\u2019s said in the past. So I\u2019ll lay out my\nthoughts on why that is, and he can decide if this is worth another post where\nhe clarifies his position.\n\nThe marginal unit of health care doesn\u2019t come clearly marked. If we want to\ncut the marginal unit of health care (for example, following Robin\u2019s\nrecommendation to cut health care in half) we need to cut specific things. If\nyou would otherwise get ten treatments in a year, you need to cut out five if\nyou want to halve health care like Robin suggests. Which five? You could make\nthe decision centrally (the medical establishment decides some interventions\nare less valuable than others, and insurance stops covering those) or in a\ndecentralized free-market way (customers get less insurance, increasing the\ncost of medical care and causing them to make harder trade-offs about when to\nget it), but somebody has to make this decision at some point. On what basis\ndo they make it?\n\nOne possible reasonable position might be \u201cobviously the cancer stuff and the\nantibiotics are important, so definitely keep those. Find stuff which seems\nfrivolous, and then cut that.\u201d\n\nMy impression is that Robin has very clearly rejected this position. For\nexample, from here:\n\n> It is clearly not the case that marginal care contains mostly treatments\n> that doctors know to be less useful and more frivolous, while the serious\n> situations where doctors know medicine is very valuable are usually in\n> common care. In fact, doctors do not seem to see a difference between common\n> and marginal care. So, if common care is much more useful on average than\n> the useless-on-average marginal care, it must be because each patient\n> somehow knows something that doctors cannot see about when he really needs\n> to see a doctor. Now how likely is that?\n\nWe just don\u2019t know which treatments are useful vs. bad? But don\u2019t we know, for\nexample, that antibiotics are good? Robin again:\n\n> But what about those miracles of modern medicine we have all heard so much\n> about? Did not the introduction of antibiotics, for example, dramatically\n> reduce death rates for key diseases? Well, not much actually.\n\nPublic health measures? Sanitation? Clean water? Robin again:\n\n> If medicine for treating individuals is not quite the miracle we have heard,\n> does public health make up the difference? Have not we all heard how the\n> introduction of modern water and sewer systems greatly improved our\n> ancestors\u2019 health? Well, a century ago the U.S. cities with the most\n> advanced water and sewer systems had higher death rates than the other\n> cities. Also, we can look today at how the death rates of individual\n> households correlates with the water sources and sewer mechanisms used by\n> those households. Even in poor countries with high death rates, once we\n> control for a few other variables like social status we usually find that\n> water and sewer parameters are unrelated to death rates. Well we must live\n> longer now for some reason, right? Yes . . . but the fact is that we just do\n> not know why we now live so much longer.\n\n(Robin seems more bullish on sanitation elsewhere, so maybe he\u2019s changed his\nmind? Like I said, I have trouble fitting all his statements into a coherent\nmodel.)\n\nOkay, then how do we halve medical care? In his CATO Unbound article, I\ninterpret him as saying it didn\u2019t matter how you did it, because \u201cmost any way\nto implement such a cut would likely give big gains.\u201d\n\nAm I straw-manning him again here? Doesn\u2019t he obviously think we should spend\nsome time figuring out which medical treatments are good and effective (cancer\ncare? vaccines?) so we don\u2019t accidentally cut those?\n\nIn a podcast, he mocked other economists who said that you needed to be really\ncareful and work hard to figure out which parts of medicine were good, so you\ncould make sure to cut only the useless parts:\n\n> I did a Cato Unbound forum about 10 years ago where my starting essay was\n> cut medicine in half, and a number of prominent health economists responded\n> there. None of them disagreed with my basic factual claims about the\n> correlation of health and medicine and other things, but, still, many of\n> them were reluctant to give up on many medicine. They said, \u201cWell, yes, on\n> average, it doesn\u2019t help, but some of it must be useful and, uh, we\n> shouldn\u2019t cut anything until we figure out what the useful parts are,\u201d and I\n> make the analogy of that with a monkey trap.\n>\n> In many parts of the world, there are monkeys that run around, and you might\n> want to eat one. To do that, you need to trap one, and a common way to trap\n> a monkey is you take a gourd, that is, a big container that\u2019s empty, and you\n> put a nut on the inside of that gourd, and the monkey will reach into the\n> gourd and put his fist around the nut and try to pull his hand out because\n> then mouth is too small to get his hand up, and he will not let go of that\n> nut.\n\nRobin thinks it\u2019s a \u201cmonkey trap\u201d to try to cut the good parts of medicine but\nnot the bad. This seems consistent with his claim that you can\u2019t distinguish\ngood from marginal care, and with his claim that he\u2019s not sure antibiotics or\npublic sanitation are good.\n\nIt seems to me that if we were to cut medicine in half, figuring out which\nhalf to cut would be among the most consequential decisions in history. If we\ndid it foolishly - for example, cut out all treatments that start with letters\nA - M - then we would lose antibiotics, appendectomies, AIDS medications, etc.\nI would expect even small mistakes in this process to cause more deaths than\n9-11, the Iraq War, or other things we think of as greatly consequential.\n\nBut Robin doesn\u2019t seem to think this matters very much, and his antibiotics\nand public health comments make it sound like this is because he\u2019s not\nparticularly sure that any kind of medicine works. This is the context in\nwhich I cited his casino quote (source) in the original article:\n\n> Imagine someone claimed that casinos produce, not just entertainment, but\n> also money. I would reply that while some people have indeed walked away\n> from casinos with more money than they arrived with, it is very rare for\n> anyone to be able to reasonably expect this result. There may well be a few\n> such people, but there are severe barriers to creating regular social\n> practices wherein large groups of people can reasonably expect to make money\n> from casinos. We have data suggesting such barriers exist, and we have\n> reasonable theories of what could cause such barriers. Regarding medicine\n> (the stuff doctors do), my claims are similar.\n\nIn the context of everything else, I can\u2019t help but interpret this as\nsuggesting that medical care is net neutral, or even (like casinos) net\nnegative, and that just as there is no specific slot machine that you know\nwill work at a casino, and you would do best avoiding all of them, so there\u2019s\nno one medical treatment that we know is positive in expectation, and cutting\nany of it would be fine.\n\nMaybe this is all straw-manning, all of this is taken out of context, and the\nonly place that Robin says his true opinion is in his book. But in that case I\nfeel like this is a pretty extreme failure of communication that\u2019s not\nentirely my fault. Also, other people seem to interpret it the same way I do:\n\nIf I thought medical care was mostly effective and just needed to be trimmed\naround the margin, and my readers were posting that I thought medical care was\n\u201cuseless\u201d, or that \u201cALL health spending is wasteful\u201d, or that \u201cmedicine is net\nneutral for health\u201d - I would be horrified and try to clear it up as quickly\nas possible. Somehow in fifteen years this hasn\u2019t happened. I guess if I can\nget Robin to make this clarification - even if it turns out I\u2019m totally wrong\nand misunderstanding everything he says - then maybe this post will have been\nworthwhile.\n\nSo in the interests of getting a clearer understanding, I\u2019ll pose Robin a\ntrilemma:\n\n  1. Either we can\u2019t distinguish between good and bad medical interventions, but the average intervention is net positive in expectation (in which case it seems like we should keep the amount of medicine we have now, since we assess each treatment equally and they\u2019re all net positive)\n\n  2. Or we still can\u2019t distinguish between good and bad medical interventions, but the average intervention is, after you count the monetary cost, net neutral or negative in expectation (in which case one should be equally skeptical of everything, including antibiotics and cancer treatment, and I don\u2019t understand how saying this is a straw man)\n\n  3. Or we can distinguish between good and bad medical interventions, and we should throw out the bad ones and keep the good ones (in which case why does Robin keep saying the opposite, why does he call this a \u201cmonkey trap\u201d, etc? And wouldn\u2019t it be better for Robin to frame his position as \u201cmedicine generally works well, but there are some interventions that aren\u2019t evidence-based enough\u201d, which is the consensus medical position?)\n\nIf this is a false trichotomy, Robin should tell me how!\n\n###\n\nLet\u2019s Do Near Mode!\n\nDespite (maybe?) disagreeing about health care, I have a huge amount of\nrespect for Robin. He\u2019s developed or popularized many of the ideas that still\nshape my thinking. One of them is \u201cnear mode vs. far mode\u201d, his take on\nconstrual level theory. I find it helpful at times like this to try to go as\nNear Mode as possible.\n\nFor example, in one of the papers I linked above, Robin writes:\n\n> Unfortunately, even if you believe everything that I have said, your\n> behavior will probably not change much as a result. You will still spend\n> nearly as much on medicine for yourself and your family, and spend much less\n> effort on the more effective ways to increase lifespan. After all, your sick\n> family would consider it the worst kind of betrayal if you did not \u201cdo\n> something,\u201d and give them all the medicine that your doctor recommends\n> (Hanson, 2002). Alas, the problem of the fear of death muddling our thinking\n> is so much worse than we imagined.\n\nI interpret this as him saying that if you were smart, had the courage of your\nconvictions, and weren\u2019t so obsessed with signaling, then you, the literal\nreader, would cut your individual health care expenses right now after\nlearning about his theory.\n\nI, like many people, would like to spend less money on health care without my\nhealth being negatively affected in any way. The Nearest way possible to\napproach this is to think about how Robin\u2019s theory suggests that I act. Here\nare some categories of health problem that I might one day have to think\nabout:\n\n  1. A heart attack or stroke (going to the hospital)\n\n  2. Cancer (going to an oncologist, complying with their recommendations)\n\n  3. A bacterial infection, eg pneumonia, sinusitis, meningitis, etc (going to a doctor / urgent care / ER, taking antibiotics if recommended)\n\n  4. A chronic disease like Type II diabetes (going to the doctor, following their recommendations about glycemic control, taking medicine if recommended)\n\n  5. New-onset unexplained but serious-seeming symptoms, eg sudden intense abdominal pain, or suddenly feeling very dizzy (getting checked out by a doctor or hospital).\n\n  6. New-onset unexplained but mild-seeming symptoms, eg mild abdominal pain or suddenly feeling slightly dizzy (getting checked out by a doctor or hospital).\n\n  7. Acting erratically, hallucinating, saying things that don\u2019t make sense (going to a psychiatrist or mental hospital).\n\n  8. Feeling very depressed or anxious, so much so that it\u2019s hard to get through the day or do your usual work (going to a psychiatrist)\n\n  9. A middle-aged person with a family history of cardiovascular problems who hasn\u2019t gotten a checkup in a while (going to a doctor, taking statins/ACEIs/etc if recommended)\n\n  10. Just sort of feeling blah all the time, eg tired, joints ache, etc (going to the doctor and getting checked out).\n\nSo my second question for Robin is: how do you recommend I proceed? Do I avoid\ngoing to the doctor for some specific subset of these categories, like 5-10?\nAre all the categories equal, such that I should flip a coin each time I get\nan illness, and only go to the doctors if the coin comes up heads? Get certain\ncare in some categories, flip the coin for others? This isn\u2019t intended to be a\nrhetorical question. I\u2019m hoping it clarifies what it means to \u201ccut the\nmarginal unit of health care\u201d, what a reader who didn\u2019t have \u201cthe fear of\ndeath muddling [their] thinking\u201d would do, and how much Robin believes we can\ndistinguish between good and bad treatments.\n\nActually, we can get even Nearer. My wife and I recently took my four-month-\nold son to the pediatrician. The pediatrician said he had a mis-shapen head,\nand referred him to a head specialist for a second opinion. The specialist\nsaid yup, looks pretty mis-shapen, and referred us to a helmet-maker. The\nhelmet-maker said yeah, definitely mis-shapen, and wants us to pay $300 for a\nhelmet to correct it so my son doesn\u2019t get stuck permanently looking like\nFrankenstein when he grows up.\n\n(there are some studies of this intervention, which are neither obviously\nwrong nor obviously unimpeachable. They say the helmet works, but not\nnecessarily better than \u201crepositioning therapy\u201d. Our son refuses repositioning\ntherapy, so for us it\u2019s the helmet or nothing.)\n\nThat helmet is probably our \u201cmarginal\u201d health care expense, in the sense that\nit\u2019s less obviously important than the other two things we\u2019ve used healthcare\nfor this year (childbirth, a scare with our son\u2019s breathing). So, if we\u2019re\ntrying to cut the marginal health care expense, should we skip the helmet?\nMaybe we should skip it - I never see any adults with obviously mis-shapen\nheads out there, and surely they didn\u2019t all get $300 helmets as kids. Maybe\nit\u2019s all a racket.\n\n(for pictures of people with mis-shapen heads, see here, dead dove, do not\neat)\n\nHow would Robin recommend I make this decision, if not by consulting the\nstudies? Should I just base it off the RAND experiment? Are we sure that there\nwere any babies with mis-shapen heads in RAND at all? Did RAND even use \u201chas\nnon-Frankenstein head shape\u201d as an endpoint? Should I still go off RAND? Or\nshould I trust Johns Hopkins and all the specialists when they say this is\ngood?\n\nThis is as Near as I can get. What now? Is Robin\u2019s advice just aimed at some\nhypothetical dumb person who constantly gets healthcare for stupid reasons and\nnever considered stopping? Or should I personally try not to get health care\nin situations like this one? If I value my son looking like a normal human\nbeing when he grows up at (let\u2019s say) $30,000, then it seems like I should\nonly need a 1% credence that this therapy works before I spend $300 on it (and\nsurely my credence of something backed up by all available studies is higher\nthan that). Is this Pascal\u2019s Wager? But doesn\u2019t all medicine have those kinds\nof odds? What do I do?\n\n###\n\nOn Cancer, Heart Attack, Etc Survival Rates\n\nMoving through more specific sections of his post.\n\nHanson:\n\n> First, my claim of a near zero marginal health gain from more medicine on\n> average is consistent with some particular kinds of medicine having a\n> positive marginal gains. We name some plausible candidates in our book.\n> Cancer and heart attacks could also be among them. Or maybe just childhood\n> cancer.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how this isn\u2019t the CATO economist position. \u201cKeep the good\nstuff that we know works, and look for likely-not-to-work forms of treatment\naround the edges that we can cut\u201d. I certainly have some guesses about forms\nof medicine that don\u2019t work - most surgeries for back pain are in this\ncategory. Do they add up to half of all medicine? I\u2019m not sure, but if Robin\nagrees that this is the discussion, we can compare our lists and try to figure\nit out.\n\n> Second, to be relevant to my claim these treatments need to be of the sort\n> that many people get but many others do not. I\u2019m willing to presume that\n> cancer and heart attack treatment fall into this category, but Scott doesn\u2019t\n> show this.\n\nAgain, if Robin\u2019s claim is that medicine is only useless on the margins, we\u2019re\nmuch closer to agreement. But I don\u2019t know how that meshes with saying that\nmaybe antibiotics don\u2019t help, or that we can\u2019t possibly distinguish marginal\nfrom core, or that health spending is mostly signaling (as opposed to a mix of\npeople correctly spending money on health because they know it\u2019s great and\nwill help them, plus some extra from people not being scientists and not\nknowing which treatments are good or bad).\n\n> Third, Scott is well aware that many others attribute much of these changes\n> to the population getting generally healthier over time, and thus better\n> able at each age to deal with all disease, and also to earlier screening,\n> which catches cases that would never get very bad. He judges:\n>\n> \u00bb Although some of this is confounded by improved screening, this is\n> unlikely to explain more than about 20-50% of the effect. The remainder is\n> probably a real improvement in treatment.\n>\n> But he seems well aware that many other specialists judge differently here.\n\nBut the link is to a blog post where I examine this and find many studies\nshowing, I think very clearly, that it really is medicine and not screening!\nYes, other people think differently, but the link you\u2019re using is a post about\nwhy they\u2019re wrong!\n\nBut also, why is Robin objecting to this! I thought he was admitting that\ncancer treatment is maybe potentially good! This is why I find this\nconversation so frustrating. Mention a medical treatment to Robin, even one of\nthe \u201cgood ones\u201d like cancer or antibiotics, and he\u2019ll try to argue that maybe\nthe evidence it works is being misinterpreted, and in fact it\u2019s unclear how\nwell it works. Then I say he thinks this stuff might not work, and he accuses\nme of straw-manning him.\n\nI would have no objection if there were, in fact, some evidence that cancer\ntreatment was useless, and he was trying to bring it to my attention. But all\nhe\u2019s doing is linking my post showing that it\u2019s not true, plus the article I\nstarted my post with as an example of the false narrative I\u2019m trying to\ncorrect.\n\n###\n\nOn Insurance Experiments\n\nI don\u2019t see Hanson responding to my main point, which is that the insurance\nexperiments show signs of having their power fail at random points in the\ncausal chain, rather than showing anything about medicine. Just to rehash this\nfor people who forgot:\n\n  * The Karnataka experiment couldn\u2019t show that insurance made people more likely to give birth in hospitals, or more likely to have a doctor tell them that their blood pressure was too high, or basically any outcome related to how much care they were getting, let alone whether that care worked.\n\n  * The Oregon experiment found people got more diabetes drugs, but not that they had less diabetes. However, if you do a power calculation based on the increase in diabetes drugs and the known effect of diabetes drugs, we find that the experiment wouldn\u2019t have detected it even if it was there.\n\n  * ...and the same is true of hypertension and most of the other things they measured.\n\n  * The RAND outcomes I found were mostly things that doctors had no medicine for in the 1970s when the study was conducted. For example, they measured the effect of health care on obesity, but there were no good obesity drugs in the 1970s.\n\nInstead, he discusses small quibbles with how I describe certain results. I\u2019ll\ngo through these quibbles, but I want to make it clear I don\u2019t think they\nmatter very much, and I would much rather talk about the main point. Going\nthrough the quibbles:\n\n> Scott sees the first three as too underpowered to find interesting results.\n> He found the results of RAND \u201cmoderately surprising\u201d, but thinks \u201cit\u2019s a\n> stretch to attribute [p = 0.03 blood pressure result] to random noise\u201d, even\n> if its the only result out of 30 at p<0.05.\n\nI find it unfair to present this claim without presenting my reasoning, which\nis that there\u2019s a whole other paper, How Free Care Reduced Hypertension In The\nRAND Health Insurance Experiment, which does various sanity checks to this\nresult, finds that it holds up, and finds related claims with lower p-values.\n\n> Scott calls Karnataka a \u201cstudy where the intervention didn\u2019t affect the\n> amount of medical care people got very much\u201d as \u201cthey were unable to find a\n> direct effect of giving people free insurance on those people using\n> insurance, at all, in the 3.5 year study period!\u201d But I see the study as\n> reporting big utilization effects:\n>\n> \u00bb The average annual insurance utilization rate at 18 months (3.5 years) is\n> 13.46% (2.56%) in the free-insurance arms versus 7.72% (0.64%) in the\n> control arm. On average this effect amounts to a 74.35% (400%) increase in\n> insurance utilization at 18 months (3.5 years).\n\nI said in my original post that utilization rates increased when spillovers\nwere taken into account, but did not directly increase for the insured\nindividuals. He is quoting the first half of a section that then goes on to\nsay \u201cSpillovers play an important role in boosting utilization. At 18 months\nand 3.5 years, ITT estimates of the direct effects of insurance access are not\nsignificant.\u201d\n\nSo this was exactly what I said in my post, except that Robin takes out my\nexplanation and quotes only half of the section, so that I look like a moron\nwho didn\u2019t read the paper.\n\n> This seems to me a non-trivial constraint on medical effectiveness:\n>\n> \u00bb We cannot rule out clinically-significant health effects, on average equal\n> to 11% (8.8%) of the standard deviation for each health outcome in ITT\n> (CATE) analyses.\n>\n> (They can rule out larger effects.)\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t just about the effects of medicine. The outcomes Hanson is\ntalking about include many things like giving birth in a hospital, or having\nsurgery, or being told you have arthritis. If insurance can\u2019t improve the\nlikelihood of these things, it\u2019s failing to connect with the medical system at\nall, not some kind of evidence that medicine doesn\u2019t work.\n\nOn the Goldin paper:\n\n> Now while their OLS estimate of the effect of treatment on mortality is only\n> significant at the 1% level (and that exaggerated by selection bias), their\n> OLS estimate of the effect of more insurance on mortality looks much\n> stronger.

But\n> as they never even discuss this crazy huge significance in the text, I have\n> to suspect that this is just a table typo.\n\nOther people have pointed this out and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on here.\nCremieux thinks all of Goldin might be a Lindley\u2019s paradox situation\n(suggesting it isn\u2019t a real effect), and I\u2019m trying to clear this up with him\nand figure out if he\u2019s right. I think my case is still strong if we stick with\nthe lower treatment effect or ignore Goldin entirely.\n\n> As Scott knows, we have a huge problem of selective publication and\n> specification search (\u201cp-hacking\u201d), especially in medicine, which is why I\u2019m\n> suspicious of the few \u201cquasi-experimental studies\u201d that find big health\n> gains from medicine.\n\nIn 2004, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors released a\nstatement saying they would no longer accept non-pre-registered studies that\nstarted after July 1, 2005. Since then, all studies have had to pre-specify\ntheir protocol, making p-hacking much harder. You can see the results on trial\ncomposition here:\n\n...and on p-hacking levels here:\n\nObviously this doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s no possible way medical studies could\never be biased. But I worry that people act like \u201cstudies can be p-hacked\u201d is\nsome sort of secret knowledge that elevates them above domain experts. Medical\nevidence is processed by groups like NICE and the Cochrane Collaboration that\nhave been worrying about p-hacking since 2004, trying to factor its existence\ninto their recommendations, and organizing pretty successful campaigns among\njournals and other stakeholders to minimize it. This doesn\u2019t mean everything\nis perfect, but I think we\u2019re beyond the level where you can say \u201cwhat about\np-hacking\u201d and use it to throw out every clinical study in favor of for three\nsocial science experiments that explicitly admit they don\u2019t have enough power\nto test these kinds of questions.\n\n> I know that typical regressions of health on medicine find no effect, and\n> also that medical errors and prescription drugs cause huge numbers of\n> deaths. Thus I focus on our few best studies: randomized experiments.\n\nThe first link goes to a study that does not try to quantify the number of\ndeaths from medical error. The second goes to a claim that that prescription\ndrugs are the third leading cause of death. For the latter, I would recommend\nreading Medical Error Is Not The Third Leading Cause Of Death and \u201dMedical\nerrors are the third leading cause of death\u201d and other statistics you should\nquestion. These numbers usually come from massively overcounting medical\nerrors from studies not intended to quantify them, from calling any death that\nhappens after a medical error a result of a medical error, and from ignoring\nthe many more sober estimates of medical error fatality rate that have been\npublished. This isn\u2019t to say that medical errors aren\u2019t real and serious, just\nthat I don\u2019t think many people now continue to defend that particular claim.\n\n> While many studies claim to show otherwise for specific treatments, those\n> tend to be quite biased, pushing me to focus on our best studies: randomized\n> trials of aggregate medicine. I say that they still consistently fail to\n> find clear effects.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to explain how thoroughly I disagree with this claim, but let me\ntry one more time.\n\nSuppose we want to know something simple, like whether being shot with a gun\ncan kill someone.\n\nOne option is that we get trials where we shoot a thousand people with guns,\nshoot another thousand people with placebo guns (blanks), and see how many in\neach group die. Maybe we could do this a hundred times, for every different\ntype of gun. Maybe we\u2019d even find that some guns (eg BB guns) don\u2019t kill\npeople, and we could replicate that a dozen times. I believe this method would\nbe very decisive.\n\nBut maybe this would be \u201cbiased\u201d. Maybe the only unbiased way to test this,\nfor some reason, is to give a thousand people a special voucher that they can\nuse to buy guns, and leave another thousand people as a control. Then we wait\ntwo years, and see whether the voucher group gets convicted of murder more\noften than the control group.\n\nAnd maybe in fact we do this, and we find that there are three more convicted\nmurderers in the voucher group, but this isn\u2019t statistically significant.\n\nDo we conclude that \u201cbeing shot with a gun can\u2019t kill you\u201d? Or \u201cthe marginal\ngun can\u2019t kill you?\u201d\n\nNo. Among many other possible ways this could go wrong, we might find that\nonly three extra people in the voucher group tried shooting someone. This\nexactly corresponds to our three extra deaths, consistent with a 100% death\nrate from being shot. But if you don\u2019t ask this question, and you just stop at\n\u201cwell, there were only three extra murders, which isn\u2019t statistically\nsignificant\u201d, then it looks like getting shot with a gun can\u2019t kill you.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you would prefer the second form of study over the\nfirst, especially if you are going to summarize its results as \u201cguns aren\u2019t\ndangerous\u201d.\n\n(...the marginal gun isn\u2019t dangerous? Some guns are dangerous, but we can\u2019t\ntell which ones? Some guns are dangerous, we can tell which ones, and we\nshould just focus on those?)\n\nMaybe I\u2019m still misunderstanding Robin. I look forward to him clarifying his\nposition further.\n\nIn case my own position isn\u2019t clear: I think lots of medicine is useless, and\nthat most doctors would agree with this. We over-order tests when we don\u2019t\nneed them, we do a lot of ineffective stuff to please patients (starting with\nantibiotics for viral illnesses, but sometimes going up to surgeries that have\nonly placebo value), and we do lots of treatments that we know fail >90% of\nthe time, like certain kinds of rehab for drug addiction (we tell ourselves\nwe\u2019re doing it because the tiny number of people who do benefit deserve a\nchance, but a rational health bureaucrat who wants to save money might not see\nit that way). Does all this add up to half? I\u2019m not sure. But I think we can\nwork on cutting back on this stuff without saying things like \u201cmaybe medicine\nis just about signaling\u201d or \u201chow do we know if any of it works?\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t\ntrust clinical trials because they\u2019re all biased\u201d, and that it very very much\nmatters which parts of medicine we cut.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if expensive insurance doesn\u2019t have much marginal\nmortality benefit over cheap insurance, although it might still be worth it on\na personal level (because it gets you faster care, kinder doctors, fancier\nhospital rooms, etc).\n\nI don\u2019t think the insurance studies tell us anything one way or the other\nhere, and I have no confidence that the things that skeptics think they cast\ndoubt upon are the things we should really be doubting.\n\n### Subscribe to Astral Codex Ten\n\nBy Scott Alexander\n\nP(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\n15 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n15\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Response to Hanson On Health Care\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n12\n\nShare\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### Response to Hanson On Health Care\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n12 Comments\n\n  * New First\n  * Chronological\n\nRuben C.
