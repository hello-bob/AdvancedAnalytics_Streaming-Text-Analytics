What happened next is every writer\u2019s worst\nfear.\n\nTo revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.\n\nPHOTO-ILLUSTRATION: ANJALI NAIR; GETTY IMAGES\n\nOn the evening of March 24, 2024, writer K. Renee was doing what she often\ndoes: curling up on the couch and watching hockey with her husband. It was the\nDallas Stars versus the Arizona Coyotes. Renee has followed the Stars her\nwhole life. She was born the season they won the Stanley Cup. As she watched,\nshe got a strange message: a friend texted to say the shared Google folders\nwhere Renee kept her works in progress were no longer accessible. Her friend\nhad planned to read and make notes on one of Renee\u2019s stories and was surprised\nto be locked out.\n\n\u201cYou no longer have permission to view this document,\u201d said the pop-up\nmessage. \u201cIf you believe this is an error, contact the document owner.\u201d\n\nThis was how Renee experienced a moment that most of us have heart-pounding 3\nam stress nightmares about. All 10 of her works in progress\u2014some 222,000 words\nacross multiple files and folders\u2014were frozen. Not just frozen, but\ninaccessible on her phone and tablet. When her husband fetched her laptop,\nRenee logged into Docs and tried sharing the documents again. Then she\nreceived her own message from Google.\n\nFeatured Video\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t share item,\u201d was the header. \u201cYou cannot share this item because it has\nbeen flagged as inappropriate,\u201d read the body text.\n\nRenee writes hockey romance. People who get to see her drafts first, her\ncommunity of alpha and beta readers, all have that in common. Renee describes\nher work as \u201copen-door spice.\u201d Aside from being an amazing name for an\noverpriced cocktail, the term serves as a descriptor for the level of\nexplicitness in romance fiction. Simply put, \u201copen-door\u201d means more explicit;\n\u201cclosed-door\u201d means less. Reading an open-door romance is like watching a John\nWick movie. You see the knife go in. Closed-door romances are like watching a\nMarvel movie. You know something is happening to someone\u2019s body, but you never\nreally see it.\n\nWhen she saw the word inappropriate in the notification, Renee worried her\nwork had been dinged for its spice. \u201cI thought I was the problem,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI thought I had somehow messed it up.\u201d\n\nBut she hadn\u2019t. At least, she hadn\u2019t messed it up in any way she could hope to\navoid in the future. Google never specified which of her 222,000 words was\ninappropriate. There were no highlighted sections, no indicators of what had\nrendered her documents unshareable. Had one of her readers flagged the content\nwithout discussing it with her first? Was it a malicious attack on the files?\nHad someone at Google decided her content was too spicy? Renee hadn\u2019t turned\non any of the AI functions in Google Workspace, so she doubted it could be\nchalked up to a bot banning her books. After all, a 2016 paper coauthored by\nGoogle researchers revealed that its recurrent neural network language models\nhad been fed thousands of romances. If for some reason a bot was crawling her\nwork, wouldn\u2019t it recognize what it was looking at?\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

It remained that way for two days. During those two\ndays, her email slowed to a crawl\u2014and she heard from others who had the same\nexperience. \u201cTruthfully, there\u2019s more communities that have been affected by\nthis; they\u2019re just scared to say anything,\u201d she says.\n\nThis may be true. Posting, under your own name, that your content has been\nfound \u201cinappropriate\u201d means that search engines, Google among them, might\nassociate your name and that word together forever. There is a genuine\npotential for social stigma when making a complaint of this nature in the\npublic square\u2014which is to say, online. And given the way that large language\nmodels dredge everything written online in an effort to sort which words\nbelong together in context, the words most commonly associated with any\nindividual name gain greater semantic weight and are more likely to be\nreproduced when users of these models \u201cask\u201d the model for an \u201canswer.\u201d\n\nGenerally speaking, files containing violence, abuse, child sexual abuse\nmaterial, and gore violate the terms of service for Google Drive and its\nassociated products, like Docs and Sheets. Exceptions are made, though, for\neducational, artistic, and journalistic purposes. \u201cThere are clear policies\nfor how our tools may be used, and we may review and take action on any\ncontent that violates our policies,\u201d Google spokesperson Jenny Thomson said\nwhen reached for comment on this story. \u201cIf a user receives a notification\nthat their file violates Google\u2019s terms of service or program policies, and\nthey believe it\u2019s an error, they can request an appeal.\u201d\n\nThe night Renee\u2019s docs got frozen, the Dallas Stars won 4-2, continuing their\nwinning streak. As ESPN uploaded video highlights of the game, Renee was\nsubmitting a report to Google. As of this writing, she has not heard back.\n\nRenee likely isn\u2019t alone. As she tried to figure out what happened, she shared\nthe situation with a writers\u2019 Slack channel she frequents. From there, it went\nto Instagram, where other writers advised their fellow scribes to back up\ntheir work. One even posted that a similar thing had happened to them: \u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen scouring the internet for answers because this just happened last night.\nI have 8 betas, and randomly last night it all shut down. \ud83d\ude2dSame content, I\u2019m\nan adult romance fantasy author. Any news?!\u201d\n\nThat author later posted a video to Instagram explaining that it wasn\u2019t the\nadult content in the files but rather \u201cGoogle thought I was spamming people.\u201d\nApparently, sending the same doc to scores of people\u2014for example, alpha and\nbeta readers\u2014can make it appear as though the doc was unsolicited.\n\nAutomated moderation is nothing new. In 2021, activists raising awareness of\nMissing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found some posts mentioning\nMMIWG had disappeared from Instagram. In 2020, one Black Lives Matter activist\ndiscovered that Facebook had mistakenly flagged their account for IP\nviolations, erasing documentary footage that included instances of alleged\npolice brutality. (The activist\u2019s profile was soon restored.) In 2018, Tumblr\nbanned \u201cadult content,\u201d and queer communities warned that losing their spaces\nonline would make things even more difficult for queer youth and others\nquestioning or discovering their sexuality. (Tumblr modified this ban years\nlater.) But what the sudden loss of an online community most resembles\nhappened in 2007: Strikethrough.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

To a banhammer, every query looks like a nail:\ndepictions of rape disappeared, but so did posts by rape survivors. The same\nwas true of incest, abuse, and violence. The ensuing exodus of users led to\nthe founding of DreamWidth, Archive of Our Own, and the Organization for\nTransformative Works. Today, all three are still operational.\n\nWhile it\u2019s still unclear what exactly happened to Renee\u2019s docs, or if it\u2019s\njust a fluke, the effects of mishaps like this are complex. Even though it\u2019s\nnow commonplace, there can still be unease around letting major corporations\nstore personal writing. For authors who write about sex, say, or queer people\ntrying to find a voice, hearing that your content could be flagged as\n\u201cinappropriate\u201d can have a chilling effect. The problem, says bestselling\npseudonymous author Chuck Tingle, is that companies like Google now function\nlike utilities. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as water and electric,\u201d he says.\n\nTingle would know: His \u201cTinglers,\u201d erotica pieces he releases as Kindle\nSingles, led to his contract at Macmillan for the queer horror novels Camp\nDamascus and Bury Your Gays. Those early singles were written without the\nbenefit of editors, often within a matter of hours. They\u2019re sloppy. \u201cThey\u2019re\npunk rock,\u201d he says, but they also helped him build a community around the\n\u201cunderdog genres\u201d of erotica, horror, and comedy that his work falls into. If\nAmazon decided to stop selling his Tinglers, it would be a big blow, even\nthough he now has a book deal.\n\nAppropriate is a word with two usages and meanings in common parlance. The\nfirst is as an adjective, as in the message Google sent to Renee. It describes\nsuitability in context, fitness to purpose. The second usage is as a verb, and\nit\u2019s much closer to the original Latin appropriatus, which means \u201cto make\none\u2019s own\u201d or \u201cto take possession of.\u201d\n\nWhether we\u2019re discussing the \u201cappropriation\u201d of cultural slang or a piece of\nreal estate, we mean a transfer of ownership. But both meanings of the word\nspring from that Latin origin and its antecedent, the word privus: the word\nthat begat (among others) the words private, property, and proper. All of\nthese words grew from the same source, and in one way or another they all\ndescribe qualities of belonging.\n\nThis is a story about belonging.\n\nAccessibility, infrastructure, and organization are all important to Renee as\na writer and as a person in daily life. She tracks more than just her word\ncount: she tracks meals, moods, and medications. \u201cWe have to be organized,\u201d\nshe says.\n\nBy \u201cwe,\u201d Renee means her fellow disabled people. The first time one of her\npatient portals experienced a privacy breach and sent her a letter about it,\nshe was 16. By then, she\u2019d had to give up hockey, moving from the ice to the\nbench to the couch. \u201cI\u2019m always in pain. That\u2019s a part of my illnesses. That\u2019s\ngoing to be my life. I\u2019ve come to terms with that. I\u2019ve accepted that.\u201d She\ntracks her symptoms meticulously in part because the faster her appointments\nend, the sooner she can be back in bed.\n\n\u201cListening to me now, you wouldn\u2019t know that I\u2019m chronically ill and\ndisabled,\u201d Renee says. \u201cYou can\u2019t really see it either. My illnesses, my\ndiagnoses, are invisible.\u201d For this reason, Renee has experienced disbelief\nand gatekeeping when she uses a cane, wheelchair, or forearm crutches as a\ntwentysomething. She has written similar moments into her fiction, like a\nscene wherein one character is second-guessed because she\u2019s in a wheelchair\none day and not using it the next.\n\nRenee sees her work as opening conversations about disability and the\nperception of disability. Until Google Docs locked her out, she had the data\nto back up her hypothesis, in the form of long comment threads between reader\nand author. It remains the goal of her published work. \u201cIf even one person\nsecond-guesses\u201d the way they think about disability, she says, \u201cI feel my\nwriting has done what it needs to do.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Get Plaintext\u2014Steven Levy's long view on tech\n\n  * What if your AI girlfriend hated you?
