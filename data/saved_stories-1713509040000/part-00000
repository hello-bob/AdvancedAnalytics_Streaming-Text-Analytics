In this scenario, the physical laws governing our reality are\nsimply algorithms. The experiences we have are generated by the computational\nprocesses of an immensely advanced system.\n\nWhile inherently speculative, the simulated universe theory has gained\nattention from scientists and philosophers due to its intriguing implications.\nThe idea has made its mark in popular culture, across movies, TV shows and\nbooks \u2013 including the 1999 film The Matrix.\n\nThe earliest records of the concept that reality is an illusion are from\nancient Greece. There, the question \u201cWhat is the nature of our reality?\u201d,\nposed by Plato (427 BC) and others, gave birth to idealism. Idealist ancient\nthinkers such as Plato considered mind and spirit as the abiding reality.\nMatter, they argued, was just a manifestation or illusion.\n\nFast forward to modern times, and idealism has morphed into a new philosophy.\nThis is the idea that both the material world and consciousness are part of a\nsimulated reality. This is simply a modern extension of idealism, driven by\nrecent technological advancements in computing and digital technologies. In\nboth cases, the true nature of reality transcends the physical.\n\nWithin the scientific community, the concept of a simulated universe has\nsparked both fascination and scepticism. Some scientists suggest that if our\nreality is a simulation, there may be glitches or patterns within the fabric\nof the universe that betray its simulated nature.\n\nHowever, the search for such anomalies remains a challenge. Our understanding\nof the laws of physics is still evolving. Ultimately, we lack a definitive\nframework to distinguish between simulated and non-simulated reality.\n\n## A new law of physics\n\nIf our physical reality is a simulated construct, rather than an objective\nworld that exists independently of the observer, then how could we\nscientifically prove this? In a 2022 study, I proposed a possible experiment,\nbut it remains untested today.\n\nPlato (left) pointing upwards, in reference to his belief in the higher forms.\nwikipedia\n\nHowever, there is hope. Information theory is the mathematical study of the\nquantification, storage and communication of information. Originally developed\nby mathematician Claude Shannon, it has become increasingly popular in physics\nand is used a growing range of research areas.\n\nIn my recent research, published in AIP Advances, I used information theory to\npropose a new law of physics, which I call the second law of infodynamics. And\nimportantly, it appears to support the simulated universe theory.\n\nAt the heart of the second law of infodynamics is the concept of entropy \u2013 a\nmeasure of disorder, which always rises over time in an isolated system. When\na hot cup of coffee is left on the table, after a while it will achieve\nequilibrium, having the same temperature with the environment. The entropy of\nthe system is at maximum at this point, and its energy is minimum.\n\nThe second law of infodynamics states that the \u201cinformation entropy\u201d (the\naverage amount of information conveyed by an event), must remain constant or\ndecrease over time \u2013 up to a minimum value at equilibrium.\n\nSo it is in total opposition to the second law of thermodynamics (that heat\nalways flows spontaneously from hot to cold regions of matter while entorpy\nrises). For a cooling cup of coffee, it means that the spread of probabilities\nof locating a molecule in the liquid is reduced. That\u2019s because the spread of\nenergies available is reduced when there\u2019s thermal equilibrium. So information\nentropy always goes down over time as entropy goes up.\n\nMy study indicates that the second law of infodynamics appears to be a\ncosmological necessity. It is universally applicable with immense scientific\nramifications. We know the universe is expanding without the loss or gain of\nheat, which requires the total entropy of the universe to be constant. However\nwe also know from thermodynamics that entropy is always rising. I argue this\nshows that there must be another entropy \u2013 information entropy \u2013 to balance\nthe increase.\n\nMy law can confirm how genetic information behaves. But it also indicates that\ngenetic mutations are at the most fundamental level not just random events, as\nDarwin\u2019s theory suggests. Instead, genetic mutations take place according to\nthe second law of infodynamics, in such a way that the genome\u2019s information\nentropy is always minimised. The law can also explain phenomena in atomic\nphysics and the time evolution of digital data.\n\nMost interestingly, this new law explains one of the great mysteries of\nnature. Why does symmetry rather than asymmetry dominate the universe? My\nstudy demonstrates mathematically that high symmetry states are the preferred\nchoice because such states correspond to the lowest information entropy. And,\nas dictated by the second law of infodynamics, that\u2019s what a system will\nnaturally strive for.\n\nI believe this discovery has massive implications for genetic research,\nevolutionary biology, genetic therapies, physics, mathematics and cosmology,\nto name a few.\n\n## Simulation theory\n\nThe main consequence of the second law of infodynamics is the minimisation of\nthe information content associated with any event or process in the universe.\nThis in turn means an optimisation of the information content, or the most\neffective data compression.\n\nSince the second law of infodynamics is a cosmological necessity, and appears\nto apply everywhere in the same way, it could be concluded that this indicates\nthat the entire universe appears to be a simulated construct or a giant\ncomputer.\n\nA super complex universe like ours, if it were a simulation, would require a\nbuilt-in data optimisation and compression in order to reduce the\ncomputational power and the data storage requirements to run the simulation.\nThis is exactly what we are observing all around us, including in digital\ndata, biological systems, mathematical symmetries and the entire universe.\n\nFurther studies are necessary before we can definitely state that the second\nlaw of infodynamics is as fundamental as the second law of thermodynamics. The\nsame is true for the simulated universe hypothesis.\n\nBut if they both hold up to scrutiny, this is perhaps the first time\nscientific evidence supporting this theory has been produced \u2013 as explored in\nmy recent book.\n\n  * Universe\n  * Computer simulations\n  * The Matrix\n  * Simulation theory\n  * Give me perspective\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\n  * ##### Research Fellow /Senior Research Fellow \u2013 Implementation Science\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\n  * ##### GRAINS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CHAIRPERSON\n\n  * ##### Faculty of Law - Academic Appointment Opportunities\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
