This stark statistic highlights the urgency for\nan enhanced understanding of bacterial behavior, particularly chemotaxis.\nChemotaxis, the directed movement of bacteria towards favorable environments,\nis intimately linked with pathogenicity. Our group has traditionally been\nfocused on bioenergetics, studying energy transformation within cells. This\nshift towards chemotaxis may seem unexpected, but recent insights into\nmetabolite signaling underpin it.\n\nFumarate, a metabolite processed by Complex II in the Krebs cycle and\noxidative phosphorylation, has been found to influence flagellar orientation,\nfavoring a clockwise (CW) state^2,3,4. Other metabolites and regulatory\nproteins, such as CheY and YcgR, have been shown to alter or immobilize the\nflagellar state^5,6.\n\nThe intriguing question arises: How do various metabolites function as signals\nto induce similar states in the flagella? The answer lies in the switch\ncomplex, also known as the C-ring, comprised of the FliG, FliM, and FliN\nproteins. Our study was guided by the hypothesis that understanding the\nassembly of the switch complex in different states will unlock broader\nknowledge of bacterial chemotaxis and, consequently, virulence.\n\nMovie 1: Organization of the counterclockwise (CCW) and CW C-ring, showing the\nC-terminal FliF in blue, FliG in red, FliM in yellow, and three FliN subunits\nin shades of purple.\n\nWith the massive 6 MDa C-ring complex, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) was\nthe clear choice for its ability to visualize structures at near-atomic\nresolution. Following the purification of the complex, the inherent\ninstability of the sample necessitated expedited preparation for cryoEM. This\nrequired a stringent yet efficient screening process to preserve the\nstructural integrity required for precise analysis.\n\nMovie 2: Shows the C-ring at the base with FliG in red, FliM in yellow, and\nFliN in shades of purple; the MS-ring in blue; the MotAB in brown; the LP-ring\nin pink; and the rod in gray. The movie depicts the MotAB rotating the C-ring,\nthe MS-ring, and the rod in the CCW direction. Then, the MotAB moves inward to\nrotate the flagellar assembly in the CW direction.\n\nThe cryoEM studies revealed the complex's arrangement in CW and\ncounterclockwise (CCW) states. The structural differences between the CW and\nCCW states offer a mechanistic view of how the C-ring functions as a\ntransmission switch, conveying torque and directional signals to the flagellar\napparatus. We also discovered the symmetry mismatch between the C-ring and the\nMS-ring (in blue), which sits on top of the C-ring and is composed of multiple\ncopies of FliF protein.\n\nMovie 3: Showing flow of torque in CCW C-ring by employing multiple MotAB (in\nbrown) interacting with the torque helix of the C-ring's FliG protein, in\nresponse to the environmental condition or load.\n\nBy delineating the structural basis of flagellar movement, we gain potential\nleverage points for therapeutic intervention. Understanding how bacteria\norient themselves may lead to innovative strategies to curtail their\npathogenic capabilities. This research enhances our understanding of bacterial\nchemotaxis, enriching our broader comprehension of bioenergetics and the\ninterplay between cellular energy processes and bacterial motility.\n\nThe workflow and insights from our studies provide a foundation for novel\nstrategies aimed at infection control. These findings enhance our ability to\nunderstand and potentially disrupt the processes critical for bacterial\ninfection, laying the groundwork for improved methods to thwart bacterial\nvirulence and impede the development of resistance.\n\nReferences\n\n1\\.
