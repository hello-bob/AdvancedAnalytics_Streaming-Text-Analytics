To try and ease\ntensions both countries agreed to a program of \u201ccultural exchanges\u201d. In the\nsummer of 1959, as part of this effort, the Soviet Union held an exhibition in\nNew York City, a sort of mini-world fair that featured Russian cultural\ndisplays. In return, the United States held a display of its own in Moscow\u2019s\nSokolniki Park, called the American National Exhibition. The Exhibition\nfeatured booths sponsored by various American companies like IBM, Disney and\nPepsi. One exhibit featured a full-size American suburban house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nOn July 24, Soviet Premiere Nikita Krushchev visited the Exhibition, and was\nmet there by American Vice President Richard Nixon. As they toured the\nAmerican model home, the two began trading pointed political barbs at each\nother, in an exchange that became known as \u201cThe Kitchen Debate\u201d.\n\nUnknown to Krushchev, though, he was seeing another part of American\ncapitalism in action\u2014good old-fashioned hucksterism. The night before, one of\nPepsi\u2019s executives, Donald M. Kendall, had visited Nixon at the US Embassy in\nMoscow. Kendall was not only a longtime friend and supporter of Nixon, but was\nalso in charge of Pepsi\u2019s marketing division, and he now enlisted the Vice\nPresident\u2019s help. Against his company\u2019s objections, Kendall, who had ambitious\nplans to expand Pepsi\u2019s overseas markets, had agreed to sponsor a booth at the\nExhibition, where he provided Pepsi-Cola that had been bottled both with\nAmerican water and with local Russian. Recognizing the potential publicity\ncoup, Kendall begged his friend Nixon to help him get a soda into Krushchev\u2019s\nhands.\n\nIt went like clockwork. It was a hot July day in Moscow, and as the two toured\nthe Exhibition, Nixon steered Krushchev towards Pepsi\u2019s booth, where Kendall\nwas waiting to offer him a nice cold Pepsi. As photographers flashed, the\nSoviet Premiere tried both the American and the Russian versions, and promptly\nannounced that the Pepsi made with Moscow water was better. The photos of the\ncommunist Krushchev drinking capitalist Pepsi went around the world. It was an\nadvertising coup.\n\nBy 1972, Nixon was President of the United States, and Kendall was CEO of the\nPepsi-Cola Company, and once again their plans overlapped. As part of his\nd\u00e9tente policy to ease Cold War tensions, Nixon was seeking to expand\ncommercial relations with the USSR, and Kendall, as part of his plans to take\non the Coca-Cola Company, viewed the Soviet Union as a vast new market.\nCapitalizing on his earlier publicity with Krushchev and his friendship with\nNixon, Kendall now negotiated a deal with Soviet Premiere Leonid Brezhnev\nwhich gave PepsiCo exclusive rights within the USSR. Pepsi would ship raw\nPepsi syrup to 20 bottling plants in Russia where it would be carbonated and\nbottled using local water.\n\nOne of the problems that had to be dealt with, though, was the issue of\n\u201cmoney\u201d. The Russian ruble was not convertible into foreign currency and was\nworthless outside of the USSR, and the Soviet Union had no supply of American\ndollars that it could pay with. So an elaborate process was worked out: the\nAmericans would in effect barter their Pepsi products to the Russians in\nexchange for an equal value of Stolnichnaya Vodka (which was produced by the\nSoviet Government), and in turn the Pepsi Company would then have the\nexclusive right to sell Stoli in the USA.\n\nThe first bottling plant went into operation at Novorossiysk in 1974, and\nPepsi became the first capitalist consumer product to be manufactured and sold\nwithin the Soviet Union. Most important to Pepsi, its rival Coca-Cola was\nlocked out of the Russian market completely. Meanwhile, Stolichnaya, imported\nby Pepsi and sold through distributors, became the second-largest brand of\nvodka in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nBy the time the agreement was set to expire in 1989, though, the Soviet Union\nhad changed drastically. Mikhail Gorbachev was now the Soviet Premiere, and he\nintroduced sweeping domestic reforms, called glasnost (\u201copenness\u201d) and\nperestroika (\u201crestructuring\u201d), and a series of arms-control agreements with\nthe US to try to save the tottering superpower. He was also anxious to provide\nnew consumer goods to improve the Soviet economy and its standard of living.\n\nPepsi, in the meantime, was selling some 300 million rubles a year worth of\nsoda in the USSR, and was looking to expand its Soviet operations, adding\nanother 26 bottling plants and expecting sales worth over $3 billion. (And it\nalso wanted to open new businesses within the USSR for some of the other\nbrands that it owned, such as Pizza Hut.)\n\nBut once again, an obstacle appeared. The Soviet ruble was still worthless on\nthe international market, and the sales of bartered Stolichnaya were not\nenough to cover the amounts of Pepsi that the company was planning on selling.\nTo make the deal work, the Russians would have to provide something else that\nPepsiCo would be able to sell on the international market.\n\nThe solution that was reached was, to say the least, unique. With its\nfaltering economy, the USSR did not have many consumer products that it could\nsuccessfully sell to the West. But one thing it did have, thanks to its\nbloated Cold War military budget, was a lot of surplus equipment for its armed\nforces. And so, in what must be one of the oddest commercial agreements ever\nsigned, Gorbachev agreed to turn over to Pepsi a fleet of 17 obsolete Soviet\nNavy diesel attack submarines along with a decommissioned cruiser, destroyer\nand frigate, as well as a number of new civilian oil tankers. At a stroke,\nPepsiCo had become the sixth most powerful navy in the world. The oil tankers\nwould in turn be sold to Norway, and the decommissioned military ships and\nsubmarines would be sold for scrap to a shipyard in Sweden.\n\nAt one point, Kendall, now on Pepsi\u2019s Board of Directors, jokingly remarked to\nBrent Scowcroft, the Bush Administration\u2019s National Security Advisor, that \u201cWe\nare disarming the Soviet Union faster than you are.\u201d\n\nThe war that Pepsi really cared about, of course, was the Cola War with Coke.\nThe new agreement once again gave Pepsi exclusive access to the Soviet market.\nTwo Pizza Hut restaurants, owned by Pepsi, opened in Moscow, and more were\nplanned. Things seemed good for Pepsi.\n\nThen it all ended. In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, and so did PepsiCo\u2019s\nexclusive deal. Identified, perhaps unfairly, with the former Soviet regimes,\nPepsi\u2019s popularity within the former USSR fell, and Coca-Cola quickly moved in\nto dominate the new market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n## 26 thoughts on \u201cWhen Pepsi Had a Navy\u201d\n\n  1.

Madison Square Garden and Citi Field are exclusive to Coke, as is\nAmerica\u2019s largest movie chain, Regal Cinema. Regal was recently purchased by\nLondon based Cineworld and their movie theaters only sell Coke as well.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Lenny Flank says:\n\nJune 27, 2019 at 9:27 am\n\nYep. And Russia may no longer be run by the Communist Party, but most of the\noligarchs are the same people, and Russian nationalist interests are still\nantithetical to those of the USA.\n\nReply\n\n      1.
