Their human\ntoxicity and ecosystem impacts have received extensive public, scientific and\nregulatory attention. Regulatory PFAS guidance is rapidly evolving, with the\ninclusion of a wider range of PFAS included in advisories and a continued\ndecrease in what is deemed safe PFAS concentrations. In this study we collated\nPFAS concentration data for over 45,000 surface and groundwater samples from\naround the world to assess the global extent of PFAS contamination and their\npotential future environmental burden. Here we show that a substantial\nfraction of sampled waters exceeds PFAS drinking water guidance values, with\nthe extent of exceedance depending on the jurisdiction and PFAS source.\nAdditionally, current monitoring practices probably underestimate PFAS in the\nenvironment given the limited suite of PFAS that are typically quantified but\ndeemed of regulatory concern. An improved understanding of the range of PFAS\nembodied in consumer and industrial products is required to assess the\nenvironmental burden and develop mitigation measures. While PFAS is the focus\nof this study, it also highlights society\u2019s need to better understand the use,\nfate and impacts of anthropogenic chemicals.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Anthropogenic impacts on mud and organic carbon cycling\n\nArticle 09 April 2024\n\nThomas S.

Lawal\n\n## Main\n\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) constitute a class of over 14,000^1\nchemicals extensively used in industrial applications and consumer products\nbecause of their distinct water and oil repellent properties and high heat\ntolerance. PFAS are defined as fluorinated substances that contain at least\none fully fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon atom^2. This includes\nfluoropolymers (for example, Teflon), some fluorinated insecticides (for\nexample, Fludioxonil) and pharmaceuticals (for example, Bicalutamide)^3. PFAS\nare referred to as \u2018forever chemicals\u2019^4 because of their persistence in the\nenvironment. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid\n(PFOA), two of the highest-profile PFAS, were added to the Stockholm\nConvention for the protection of human health and the environment from\npersistent organic pollutants (POPs)^5 in 2009 and 2019, respectively,\nlimiting their use and production. This also coincided with a shift from\n\u2018legacy PFAS\u2019 towards novel PFAS^6 (Extended Data Table 1).\n\nRegulators worldwide have proposed or regulated varying concentrations for\nPFAS in drinking water. One of the most restrictive recommendations for\ndrinking water is Health Canada\u2019s, with the sum of all PFAS being less than 30\nng l^\u22121 (ref. ^7), whereas the European Union recommends the sum off all PFAS\nbeing less than 500 ng l^\u22121 or the sum of 20 select PFAS being less than 100\nng l^\u22121 (ref. ^8). It is noted, however, that currently Health Canada only\nrequires quantification of either at least 18 PFAS or using US Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) methods 533 and/or 537.1^9. The US EPA has proposed\ndrinking water concentration limits of 4 ng l^\u22121 for PFOS and PFOA in their\nNational Primary Drinking Water Regulation and limits on perfluorononanoic\nacid (PFNA), perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid\n(PFHxS) and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) through the hazard\nindex (HI)^10.\n\nToxicity concerns increase with fluorinated chain length (FCL), because long-\nchain PFAS (FCL > 6) usually take longer to be excreted from the body due to\ntheir lower water solubility, higher affinity for serum proteins and\nenterohepatic recirculation, which increase their elimination time from plasma\nand tissue^11,12,13. All perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) with a FCL \u2265 7\nare currently candidates for potential inclusion on the Stockholm Convention\nfor the protection of human health and the environment from POPs^5.\n\nCertain PFAS degrade to terminal perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and\nperfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and are referred to as precursors^14\n(Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Precursors are used\nextensively in the manufacture of consumer products such as cosmetics, surface\ntreated paper, waterproof textiles, insecticides, food packaging and\nfirefighting foams^15. Whereas there are too many PFAS precursors to list\nindividually, they are generally separated into three major groupings:\nfluorotelomers, sulfonamides and polyfluorinated alkyl phosphate esters\n(PAPs).\n\nWhereas studies have estimated PFAS production globally^16,17 and quantified\nPFAS in commercial and industrial products, their fate is still unknown.\nNumerous studies have investigated PFAS extent in environmental compartments,\nincluding one that suggests that four select PFAS exceed the planetary\nboundary^18. Studies have also assessed or compared aqueous phase PFAS\nconcentrations in select regions^19,20. Whereas it is widely acknowledged that\nPFAS are globally pervasive, the extent of PFAS in global surface (SW) and\ngroundwater (GW) is unknown, as is the extent to which PFAS concentrations\nexceed proposed or implemented PFAS drinking water guidelines.\n\nHere we investigate the extent and distribution of PFAS surface and\ngroundwater contamination globally. We assess PFAS concentrations with respect\nto current and proposed PFAS drinking water regulations or advisories.\nFinally, we investigate the source of PFAS contamination, including the\ndistribution of PFAS used in various consumer products, providing insights\ninto the global pervasiveness of PFAS and the ability to predict the future\nenvironmental burden of PFAS.\n\n## Extent of global PFAS water contamination\n\nTo assess the global extent and importance of PFAS in the environment, an\nextensive global dataset was developed from 273 environmental studies since\n2004, which include data for over 12,000 SW and 33,900 GW samples. As PFAS are\nnot naturally occurring^21, any PFAS found in the environment was introduced\nfrom a range of consumer and industrial products.\n\nPFAS are pervasive in SW and GW worldwide (Fig. 1). Note that, while the\nmapped data suggest Australia, China, Europe and North America are PFAS\nhotspots relative to the world (Fig. 1a), when comparing against the number of\nsamples collected (Fig. 1b), it implies that these are high-sampling zones,\npotentially skewing the representation of actual distribution. If research\nwere undertaken in more locations worldwide at sites with high aqueous film\nforming foam (AFFF) usage, such as major airports, comparable PFAS\ncontamination levels would probably be found. Additionally, high PFAS\ncontamination in Fig. 1a is not limited to areas near manufacturing sites but\nalso high-use areas. For example, Australia has no PFAS manufacturing\nfacilities^22,23 but has highly contaminated PFAS sites from firefighting\nactivities. Furthermore, sampled locations could have higher PFAS\nconcentrations compared to unsampled areas, as research efforts tend to\nconcentrate on locations where PFAS presence is likely. Given this, the\noccurrence of surface and groundwater with large PFAS concentrations estimated\nin this study may be high.\n\nFig. 1: Global map of PFAS concentration in water.\n\na, Sum of concentration of 20 PFAS subject to EU guidance in surface water,\ngroundwater and drinking water samples. Those above the EU drinking water\nlimit of 100 ng l^\u22121 (marked red on scale bar) are circled in red (for known\ncontamination sources (for example, AFFF or non-AFFF)) or black (unknown\nsources). b, Number of PFAS samples available on a 5\u00b0 longitude/latitude grid\nworldwide.\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\nThreshold regulatory PFAS concentration limits are used to benchmark the PFAS\nglobal extent in SW and GW (Extended Data Table 2). PFAS sources were divided\ninto three categories: known non-AFFF (for example, production facilities\nusing or producing PFAS, landfills), known AFFF (for example, firefighting\ntraining area) or unknown. A higher proportion of samples exceeded threshold\nlimits when associated with a known source of PFAS contamination compared with\nan unknown source (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 1\u20136). For GW samples with\nknown AFFF contamination, 71, 72 and 63% exceeded the proposed US EPA HI (n =\n6,312) or their proposed PFOS (n = 6,442) and PFOA (n = 6,447) drinking water\nregulation, respectively. However, when there was no known source, the\nincidence of exceedance of these criteria was still elevated (31, 50 and 40%\nfor the US EPA HI (n = 14,905), PFOS (n = 15,351) and PFOA (n = 15,499)\ndrinking water regulation, respectively). Given that guidance on PFAS\nthreshold concentrations vary globally, the proportion of samples that are\ndeemed of concern also varies. Groundwater with no known contamination source\nexceeded Health Canada\u2019s criteria in 69% of samples whereas only 6% of these\nsamples exceeded the EU\u2019s sum of all PFAS criteria (500 ng l^\u22121) (n = 16,151).\nIf the alternate EU sum of 20 PFAS criteria is considered, 16% of groundwater\nsamples with no known contamination source were in exceedance (n = 16,143).\nRegardless of the regulatory threshold considered, a large fraction of\ngroundwater samples would be considered unacceptable for drinking water\nconsumption. For known AFFF source SW samples, the proportion exceeding\nregulatory thresholds is similar to GW samples. However, when there was no\nknown PFAS source, or a known non-AFFF source, the incidence of SW samples\nexceeding regulatory thresholds was lower. This is expected as residence times\nin surface waters are lower than for groundwater. For this analysis, samples\nthat were below detection limits (BDL) were randomly assigned a concentration\nbetween zero and the detection limit. To assess potential bias, particularly\nfor low-threshold criteria jurisdictions (for example, PFOA < 4 ng l^\u22121 US\nEPA), this analysis was repeated with PFAS concentrations with BDL set to zero\n(Extended Data Table 3 and Supplementary Figs. 2\u20138). Whereas assumptions made\ndealing with detection limits impact results, both approaches conclude that an\nimportant fraction of samples exceeds regulatory threshold levels. As method-\ndetection limits continually decrease, the extent of exceedances will be\nbetter informed.\n\nFig. 2: Incidence of exceedance of PFAS regulatory standards or advisories.\n\nFor samples where PFAS concentrations were below detection limits, a PFAS\nconcentration was randomly assigned between zero and the detection limit.\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\n## Where does PFAS come from\n\nTo assess PFAS sources to the environment, consumer and industrial products\ncontaining PFAS were divided into those used for AFFF and non-AFFF. AFFF\napplications typically result in high concentration point sources of PFAS, as\ndo industrial manufacturing sites that synthesize or use PFAS. The latter are\nconsidered known (non-AFFF) sources in this study.\n\n### Non-AFFF consumer and industrial products\n\nPFAS in 943 non-AFFF consumer products in 15 categories were characterized\nfrom 38 literature studies since 2010. In these studies, 113 PFAS were\nquantified, although at most 60 PFAS were analysed in any given study^24.\nComparison of PFAS classes in consumer products is challenging as the same\nsuite of PFAS are not quantified in each study. For example, at least two\nPFCAs or PFSAs were measured in 89% and 69% of all non-AFFF product samples,\nrespectively, whereas only 49%, 35%, 20%, 12% and 15% of studies quantified at\nleast two fluorotelomers, sulfonamides, PAPs, novel or other PFAS,\nrespectively. When measured, however, fluorotelomers and traditional PFCAs\nrepresented the dominant PFAS subclass in most of the product categories\ninvestigated (for example, coatings, cosmetics and textiles) (Fig. 3).\nFluorotelomers represented a median of 72% of the total measured PFAS by mass\nin consumer products, whereas PFCAs represented 25%. PAPs and sulfonamides\nwere also relevant when measured with a median of 14% and 7%, respectively.\nInterestingly, PFSAs were typically much lower, accounting for a median of 4%\nof the total quantified PFAS mass.\n\nFig. 3: Box plot of total PFAS concentration identified in various consumer\nand industrial product categories.\n\nBox dimensions show the span between quartiles 1 and 3 (interquartile range,\nIQR). Outliers are defined as values greater than 1.5\u00d7 the IQR. Whiskers\nextend from these quartiles to the largest (quartile 3) or smallest (quartile\n1) non-outlier value (that is, <1.5\u00d7 the IQR). Y-axis units are ng ml^\u22121 or \u03bcg\nkg^\u22121 equivalent to ppb.\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\nDifferent jurisdictions worldwide provide guidance, or regulate, differing\nranges of PFAS, with no standard approach to quantify PFAS. For example, the\nUS EPA has three methods to measure PFAS in aqueous samples, methods 533,\n537.1 and 8327, with an additional non-drinking aqueous method (1633) in\ndevelopment. EPA method 537 and its revisions have been the most used since\n2009, quantifying 14 PFAS. In 2018, this method was revised as 537.1 to\ninclude four additional PFAS. All other EPA methods were developed in 2019 or\nlater and quantify a total of 32 PFAS, including seven PFSA, 11 PFCA, three\nfluorotelomers, three sulfonamides and eight novel PFAS (Extended Data Table\n2). In this study, EPA draft method 1633 is used as a benchmark as EPA methods\nare commonly used globally and method 1633 is the most comprehensive. In doing\nso, this provides a preliminary assessment of the extent to which the most\ncomprehensive EPA method captures PFAS mass and the extent of unaccounted\nPFAS.\n\nIf only the PFAS listed in draft method 1633 were used to quantify PFAS in\nconsumer products within this dataset, the total embodied PFAS would be\nsubstantially underestimated (Fig. 4) and the PFAS distribution would\ncompletely change. For example, the median concentration of PFAS regulated in\nthe United States (sum of PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and GenX) in textiles\n(n = 227) and coatings (n = 167) is two and three orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the median of all PFAS quantified. Across all products, EPA method 1633\nsuggests a median distribution of 73% PFCA (n = 781), 11% PFSA (n = 750), 16%\nfluorotelomers (n = 353), 10% sulfonamides (n = 242) and 0.1% novel PFAS (n =\n27), with phosphate-based PFAS not being quantified with this method. This\nresults in the proportion of PFCAs, PFSAs and sulfonamides being overestimated\nby a factor of 2.8, 2.8 and 4.2, respectively, whereas fluorotelomers would be\nunderestimated by a factor of 25. A median of 4% of the PFAS mass in consumer\nproducts is currently subject to the Stockholm Convention (n = 976),\nincreasing to 18% with the inclusion of candidate PFAS (PFCAs with FCL \u2265 7) (n\n= 976). The average amount of long-chain PFAS within this dataset, including\nPFCAs, is 66% (n = 976), indicating that long-chain PFAS are dominant in\nconsumer products.\n\nFig. 4: Box plot of PFAS in consumer/industrial products that would be\nquantified with EPA methods or regulated in the US/EU.\n\nPFAS concentrations are in ng ml^\u22121 or \u03bcg kg^\u22121 equivalent to ppb. Box\ndimensions show the span between quartiles 1 and 3 (IQR). Outliers are defined\nas values greater than 1.5\u00d7 the IQR. Whiskers extend from these quartiles to\nthe largest (quartile 3) or smallest (quartile 1) non-outlier value (that is,\n<1.5\u00d7 the IQR).\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\nAs previously mentioned, fluorotelomers represent the largest contributor to\nPFAS mass in consumer products. Fluorotelomers are comprised of numerous\nsubgroups including fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTS), fluorotelomer alcohols\n(FTOH), fluorotelomer iodides, fluorotelomer acrylates, fluorotelomer\nmethacrylates, fluorotelomer mercaptoalkyl phosphate diester, fluorotelomer\nunsaturated carboxylic acids (FTUCA) and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids\n(FTCA). FTS represent a median 2% (n = 338) of the total PFAS in consumer\nproducts when two or more PFAS classes are quantified and are the only\nfluorotelomers quantified using the US EPA methods. FTOH require a different\nanalytical method to most other PFAS and were not often analysed. However,\nwhen two or more PFAS in this subclass were quantified, they represented an\nimportant proportion (median of 58% (n = 365)) of the total PFAS in consumer\nproducts.\n\nAlthough most PFAS in consumer products may not be currently regulated, many\nwill transform to regulated PFAS in the environment (Supplementary Tables 1\nand 2). Studies that have used the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay\nfound a notable increase in PFCAs following oxidation. This suggests that\ntraditional EPA-based methods do not adequately capture PFAS embodied in\nconsumer products and their potential environmental burden^24,25,26,27.\n\n### AFFF\n\nEleven literature studies characterize PFAS in 148 AFFF samples from different\nsuppliers and synthesis methods sold since 1980. These studies quantified 69\nPFAS with a maximum of 40 PFAS being measured in any given study^28. PFAS for\nAFFF applications have been synthesized by two synthesis processes:\nelectrochemical fluorination and telomerization^21. These processes result in\na range of products with electrochemical fluorination-producing PFOS and\ntelomerization-producing fluorotelomers^21,29. Depending on the manufacturer\nand year produced, AFFF has different formulations (Supplementary Table 3).\nPFOS represents a median 51% of the PFAS in historic 3M AFFF (n = 14), with\nother PFSAs and sulfonamides also forming important contributions. All other\nPFAS in historic 3M AFFF had low concentrations, when measured. Fluorotelomers\nand PFCAs, were the dominant PFAS in Angus AFFF (n = 28), with a median of 64%\nand 36%, respectively. Several other AFFF have been investigated, however, the\nsupplier\u2019s name was not provided or PFCA and PFSA concentrations were not\nquantified. In these samples, fluorotelomers represented the dominant PFAS\n(median = 93%, n = 83). Of these fluorotelomers, important subclasses include\nFTS (median = 73% of total PFAS, n = 69) and FTOH (median = 10% of total PFAS,\nn = 38). Comparison of PFAS quantified using EPA method 1633 to the sum of all\nPFAS quantified suggests that exclusively reporting PFAS quantified using EPA\nmethod 1633 underrepresents total PFAS in AFFF by a median factor of 2.8. A\nmedian 60% of the PFAS mass in historic 3M AFFF is subject to the Stockholm\nConvention whereas Angus AFFF has no PFAS subject to the Stockholm Convention.\nFor non-3M AFFF (n = 134), including candidate PFAS, 0.6% of the PFAS mass\nwould be subject to the Stockholm Convention, increasing to 1% if long-chain\nPFAS are considered. This analysis of AFFF formulations suggests that known\nPFAS in AFFF presents a large environmental burden, with an important fraction\neither currently subject to regulatory oversight, or likely in future.\nHowever, an undetected fraction of PFAS in AFFF probably exists^30. It is\nimportant to note that many of these studies quantify a limited number of\nPFAS, similar to non-AFFF product studies. Therefore, it is challenging to\npredict the AFFF environment burden because not all PFAS are quantified.\nFurthermore, when the TOP assay is applied to AFFF samples, considerable\nincreases in total PFAS mass has been reported^31,32, as noted in non-AFFF\nconsumer product studies.\n\n### Finding the missing piece in FTOH and other under measured PFAS\n\nAcross the 33,940 groundwater samples, 57 distinct PFAS were quantified. On\naverage, 16 distinct PFAS (maximum of 38 PFAS) were quantified and an average\nof 15 PFAS within the suite of proposed US EPA method 1633. PFCAs, PFSAs and\nsulfonamides were routinely quantified (at least two PFCAs, PFSAs and\nsulfonamides were quantified in 91%, 89% and 54% of studies, respectively).\nWhereas at least two fluorotelomers were quantified in 26% of the groundwater\nstudies, this was almost exclusively FTS, with FTCA and FTUCA quantified to a\nlesser extent and no studies quantifying FTOH. This is despite the fact that\nFTOH are an important PFAS present in consumer products, when quantified. It\nis important to note that existing EPA aqueous methods (EPA methods 533, 537,\n1633) are liquid chromatography with tandem mass sprectrometry (LC-MS/MS)\nbased. Analysis of FTOH requires gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry\n(GC-MS/MS), with no US EPA GC/MS/MS methods for aqueous PFAS in existence.\nWith regards to surface water, PFCAs, PFSAs and fluorotelomers were quantified\nto a similar extent as groundwater samples, with FTS representing the dominant\nfluorotelomers quantified. Unlike groundwater studies, four of the surface\nwater studies quantified FTOH^33,34,35,36, with only two also quantifying\nPFCAs, PFSAs or both, facilitating an assessment of the relative importance of\nFTOH. In the 16 urban river samples in China^34 and eight river samples in\nBangladesh^33, FTOH represented a median of 53% of the total PFAS (range of 46\nto 62%) and 2% (ranging from 0.9 to 34%), respectively. It is difficult to\ndraw definitive conclusions from two studies with relatively few samples,\nhowever, coupled with the FTOH prevalence in consumer products, it suggests\nthat FTOH could be an important class of unquantified PFAS. Because only a\nlimited suite of PFAS are typically quantified, any estimate of PFAS\nenvironmental burden is likely to be an underestimate, and a broader suite of\nPFAS needs to be quantified.\n\nWastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and landfills are focal point receptors of\nanthropogenic activity. Hence, representing an opportunity for quantification\nof the diverse PFAS suite that has or may be dispersed into the environment.\nUnfortunately, studies investigating WWTP influent and landfill leachate\nprovide limited insights. Whereas landfill leachate studies quantify more PFAS\nthan surface and groundwater studies, they have focused on the same range of\nPFAS (PFCAs, PFSAs, FTS and select sulfonamides) with no studies directly\nmeasuring FTOH^37. However, studies have reported atmospheric FTOH emissions\nat landfill sites and WWTPs^38. One Chinese study reported FTOH represented 8%\nof the PFAS WWTP influent mass^39. FTOH could enter the wastewater system\nthrough various sources, including laundering of textiles^40.\n\nStudies using the TOP assay to WWTP effluent report a considerable PFAS\nfraction that go undetected using EPA methods^41,42. Similarly, studies that\noxidized landfill leachate reported minimum to moderate changes in PFAS\nconcentrations, suggesting that unknown PFAS transformed biotically or\nabiotically in landfill cells^43,44. Whereas limited studies have applied the\nTOP assay to surface and groundwater, some report considerable increases in\nPFAS concentrations, although the increases are not consistent in the\nliterature^41,45,46. A major drawback of the TOP assay is that not all PFAS\nundergo oxidation to PFCAs or PFSA, particularly the perfluoroether class\nwhich transform into unmonitored terminal PFAS^47. Furthermore, there is no\nstandardized TOP assay method, and results from the variants available can\ndiffer greatly, with too harsh conditions leading to mineralization of\nterminal target PFAS^48. These findings suggest that TOP assay results may\nunderrepresent future PFAS\u02bc environmental burden. Given the relatively limited\nsuite of PFAS that have been quantified in surface and groundwater, it is not\npossible to reliably discuss the extent to which current PFAS methods\nadequately capture the range of PFAS and mass in these systems.\n\nOverall, this study suggests that a large fraction of surface and groundwaters\nglobally exceed PFAS international advisories and regulations and that future\nPFAS environmental burden is likely underestimated. Because PFAS definition\ncontinues to evolve, the extent of underestimation will be a function of PFAS\ndefinition. Additional work is needed to develop analytical techniques to\nquantify PFAS in environmental matrices, conduct a more systematic sampling\nregime of water sources globally and quantify human and ecological impacts of\nthe broad range of PFAS in the environment.\n\n## Methods\n\nThis study reviewed and collated 48,985 samples from 367 published papers and\ngovernment websites to build a comprehensive database to determine PFAS global\ndistribution in surface and groundwater (Supplementary Table 4). This study is\ntherefore limited to PFAS tested in previous studies, the analytical\ninstruments and methods used and the locations that were sampled. The data\nwere collated, compared and analysed and statistically validated using Python\nscripts and MS Excel.\n\nPFAS is reported in ng l^\u22121 for aqueous concentrations. When investigating\nPFAS concentrations in products, all data were converted to parts per billion\n(ppb) using appropriate area to mass conversions as the data include PFAS from\nan array of sources in different compartments and measured with different\ninstruments and sample-preparation techniques.\n\nThe data available were converted into an Excel file using an online open-\nsource portable document format converter when required. All data was then\nsaved as a comma-separated values or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet document\nbefore analysis with Python. To check the data, an initial screening was done\nusing a Python script, followed by manual checks. When analytes were reported\nas below detection limits (BDL) or not detected, a random value between 0 and\nthe detection limit was assigned using a loop in Python and the detection\nlimit provided in each study. Even though there are specific statistical\nmethods for handling censored data, they assume a specific data distribution\nnot applicable in this case and as there are less than 60% of samples below\nthe detection limit, substitution was suitable^49. Randomizing the\nsubstitution reduces clustering of data around a specific value and biasing of\nresults. To represent data on a map, the latitude and longitude of the\nsampling location was used. Where no location was specified other than the\ncountry, a random major city in that country was assigned to capture the\nsample\u2019s location.\n\nA list of the PFAS analytes, their major PFAS class and fluorinated chain\nlength are included in Supplementary Table 1. The PFAS classes considered\ninclude those that form as terminal products, that is, perfluorocarboxylates\n(PFCA), perfluorosulfonates (PFSA) and precursors to these terminal products.\nPrecursors included are fluorotelomers, sulfonamides and polyfluorinated alkyl\nphosphate esters (PAPs). Within the fluorotelomer PFAS class subclasses\ninclude: alcohols (FTOH), sulfonates (FTS), iodides, n:2 saturated/unsaturated\ncarboxylates (FTCA/FTUCA), acrylates and betaines.
