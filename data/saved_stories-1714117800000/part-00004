A simple fix has already been identified, and it will be available\nfor free at Ford dealers within a month.\n\nThe recall concerns 2021 and newer Bronco Sport crossovers and 2022 to 2023\nMaverick pickups. According to the official recall document, the NHTSA became\naware in October that both vehicles were prone to failures to start or loss of\npower while driving that would then result in a no-start condition. Subsequent\ndata gathering found most owners' problems went away when their vehicles'\n12-volt batteries were replaced, which led investigators to find the ultimate\ncause.\n\n2023 Ford Bronco Sport Heritage Edition. Ford\n\nBoth the Bronco Sport and Maverick used body and powertrain control modules\nthat had not been properly calibrated, and therefore failed to account for low\nbattery voltage. In situations where the alternator didn't generate enough\npower, or when stop-start was used, the vehicles' engines could cut out and\nthen not restart. This could also disable other electronics, such as hazard\nlights, raising the risk of a collision.\n\nIn total, 402,978 Bronco Sports and 53,587 Mavericks are implicated in the\nrecall. Ford has received 917 warranty reports for the problem, as well as\nthree unverified reports of fire and two of property damage\u2014though no\ninjuries. Ford will begin notifying owners of affected vehicles when recall\nservice is available starting May 13. The service will involve visiting a\ndealer to have the modules in question updated at no charge.\n\nGot a tip or question for the author?
