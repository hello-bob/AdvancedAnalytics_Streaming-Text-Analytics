In an answer to the question of why there is no evidence\nof intelligent life beyond Earth (called the Fermi paradox) despite the high\nprobability of it existing, Szil\u00e1rd responded: \"They are already here among us\n\u2013 they just call themselves Hungarians.\" This account is featured in Gy\u00f6rgy\nMarx's book The Voice of the Martians.^[2]\n\n## Men included in the description[edit]\n\nIndividuals named as members of The Martians group include:\n\n  * Paul Erd\u0151s\n  * Paul Halmos\n  * Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\n  * John G. Kemeny\n  * John von Neumann\n  * George P\u00f3lya\n  * Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd\n  * Edward Teller\n  * Eugene Wigner^[3]^[4]^[5]\n  * Franz Alexander\n  * Peter Carl Goldmark\n  * John Harsanyi\n  * Peter Lax\n  * George Olah\n  * Egon Orowan\n  * John Polanyi\n  * Valentine Telegdi\n  * Cornelius Lanczos^[5]\n\n## Origin of the name[edit]\n\nJohn von Neumann at Los Alamos\n\nThe original story from Gy\u00f6rgy Marx's book The Voice of the Martians:\n\n> The universe is vast, containing myriads of stars ... likely to have planets\n> circling around them. ... The simplest living things will multiply, evolve\n> by natural selection and become more complicated till eventually active,\n> thinking creatures will emerge. ... Yearning for fresh worlds ... they\n> should spread out all over the Galaxy. These highly exceptional and talented\n> people could hardly overlook such a beautiful place as our Earth. \u2013 \"And\n> so,\" Fermi came to his overwhelming question, \"if all this has been\n> happening, they should have arrived here by now, so where are they?\" \u2013 It\n> was Leo Szilard, a man with an impish sense of humor, who supplied the\n> perfect reply to the Fermi Paradox: \"They are among us,\" he said, \"but they\n> call themselves Hungarians.\"^[2]\n\nWhen the question was put to Edward Teller \u2013 who was particularly proud of his\nmonogram, E.T. (abbreviation of extraterrestrial)^[2] \u2013 he looked worried, and\nsaid: \"Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n must have been talking.\"^[6]\n\nAccording to Gy\u00f6rgy Marx, the extraterrestrial origin of the Hungarian\nscientists is proved by the fact that the names of Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, John von\nNeumann, and Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n cannot be found on the map of Budapest, but\ncraters can be found on the Moon bearing their names:^[2] Szilard, Von\nNeumann, Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, and a crater on Mars, Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n.^[7]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ M.
