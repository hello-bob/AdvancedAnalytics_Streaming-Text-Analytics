He has founded and sold several tech firms, and\nserved on the board of directors of companies such as the New York Times and\nUrban Outfitters. With tech journalist Kara Swisher he co-hosts the hugely\npopular tech and business podcast Pivot. He is a fierce critic of tech\ncompanies and their business models and he has written five books, the latest\nof which is The Algebra of Wealth: A Simple Formula for Economic Security.\n\nYou spend a lot of time with wealthy and successful people. Do they have any\ncommon habits? Well, the most common attribute I\u2019ve registered is they were\nborn at the right place at the right time. What I\u2019ve found is that the\nmajority of people\u2019s success is not their fault. And I think something that\nplagues people, especially tech bros, is they conflate luck with talent. But\nacross those who excel, the thing I have found is that if you want to be\nsuccessful, you need to collect allies along the way. There\u2019s this cartoon of\nMonty Burns in The Simpsons, the guy who owns the power plant, who has no\nfriends, who lights cigars with a hundred dollar bill. But what I have found\nis that really wealthy people are constantly put in rooms of opportunities,\nbecause from a young age they\u2019ve acquired allies.\n\n\u2018Musk needs to be adored ... Zuckerberg is out of his depth\u2019: Kara Swisher on\nthe toxic giants of Big Tech\n\nRead more\n\nYou say that when picking a vocation you shouldn\u2019t follow your passion. The\npeople telling you to follow your passion are already rich. Your job in your\n20s is to find something you\u2019re good at, that you could be great at. When\nthere are too many people in high-romance industries \u2013 fashion, sports,\nnightclubs, restaurants \u2013 consumers and companies don\u2019t have to pay you a lot.\nWhat I\u2019ve found is if you find something you\u2019re good at with a high employment\nrate, the accoutrements of mastery of that business \u2013 economic security,\ncamaraderie, prestige \u2013 will make you passionate about that thing. Anything\nthat provides security for your kids, your parents, and lets you do the\nincredible things that capitalist society affords will make you passionate\nabout whatever that thing is.\n\nA lot of wealth has transferred and accumulated with older generations who\nhave pulled up the drawbridge and aren\u2019t willing to change the system. Why\nshould the young engage in a structure that\u2019s stacked against them? In the US\nwe basically have seniors voting, and seniors who vote themselves more wealth.\nIn the US, the two biggest tax deductions are mortgage interest and capital\ngains. Who owns homes and stocks? People my age. Who rents, who makes all of\ntheir money from current income? Young people. Even in Covid we flushed [paid\nout in stimulus] $5tn in the US, and 60% of payments to individuals were not\nspent. They were saved and used to pay down debt. Which sent housing prices\nskyrocketing. It sent stocks skyrocketing. Which is great if you own stocks\nand houses, if you\u2019re an incumbent. But if you\u2019re an entrant trying to buy a\nhouse or hoping some day to start buying stocks yourself, everything\u2019s too\nexpensive. And even worse, we\u2019ve put it on the credit card of the young\npeople. They will pay for it. It\u2019s just a transfer of wealth from the young to\nthe old.\n\nTechnology promised to democratise knowledge, make it simpler to build\nnetworks and start businesses. But it hasn\u2019t delivered. It\u2019s a double-edged\nsword, because 25-year-olds are watching [videos about the psychologist]\nDaniel Kahneman on TikTok. They have apps that round up their purchases to the\nnearest dollar and it immediately gets invested in a stock market tracker. And\nthen if they do that, by the time they\u2019re 40, they\u2019re going to have a lot of\nmoney. So there\u2019s some amazing things about technology. They\u2019re also, though,\nfighting some real winds in their face. Technology is constantly trying to\nseduce you with the perfect offer at the perfect time to take all of your\ndisposable income.\n\nAnd in addition, for the first time in history, a 30-year-old is making less\nmoney than his or her parents were at 30. So these kids are facing a godlike\ntechnology that soaks up every disposable dime they have, just when they\u2019re\nmaking less money. And the things they need to save and make money, like a\nhouse, and/or a degree, all of these things have skyrocketed in costs. So I\nthink, actually, it\u2019s really tough for kids right now.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best\nObserver writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

But I\u2019m just sick of talking about him\n\nWhy do you think it seems to be young males who are more alienated and\ndisfranchised? You\u2019ve said they are sequestered in their basements, living a\nno-risk simulation of life. You have a generation of men who are not going to\ncollege, don\u2019t have a male role model, feel shunned by women, and they become\nmore prone to misogynistic content, more prone to nationalism, less inclined\nto believe in climate change. And some just become shitty citizens. Women are\nmuch better without the prospect of a romantic relationship. Women are much\nbetter at maintaining friend networks. And friends and relationships are not\nonly important to your mental health, they\u2019re also great guardrails. You\u2019re\njust less inclined to make a really stupid decision when you have friends in\nyour life.\n\nI relate to this because I think I was one of them when I was a young man. I\ndidn\u2019t have a lot of economic or romantic prospects. If I\u2019d had Reddit and\nDiscord and [cryptocurrency exchange platform] Coinbase and YouPorn and video\ngames, I\u2019m not sure I would have gotten out of the house very much. And if you\ndon\u2019t develop those skills, then at some point, when you\u2019re a 30-year-old who\nhasn\u2019t engaged in relationships or with the workplace, you become, I don\u2019t\nwant to say unsave-able, but there\u2019s that [Benjamin Franklin] statement that a\nlot of men die at 25 but are not buried until they are 75. I think we have a\nlot of those young men walking around right now.\n\nYou\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the UK recently. Our politicians always talk\nabout aping the success of Silicon Valley, with projects such as Silicon\nRoundabout in London, or the Silicon Fen around Cambridge. Are these just kind\nof deluded visions? It\u2019s a really interesting question, because if you look at\nthe AI boom, the biggest font of it was in the US, but the second biggest has\nbeen in the UK. There\u2019s been a ton of innovation and thought leadership around\nAI coming out of UK educational institutions, yet they haven\u2019t been able to\nreally monetise it.\n\nAnd also, my impression of London is, there\u2019s not a lot of organic value\ncreation, that the money is being made serving other people\u2019s wealth that was\nmade elsewhere. The UK has all the underpinnings for the kind of economic\ngrowth you could register with tech, and yet Apple is worth more than the\nentire FTSE 100. So the honest answer is, I don\u2019t have an answer. Whenever I\nmeet anyone who\u2019s rich in London, it\u2019s one of two things: they\u2019re serving\nother rich people, or they made their money somewhere else.\n\nOn Pivot, the podcast you present with Kara Swisher, you spend a lot of time\ntalking about Elon Musk. Will you always be talking a lot about Elon Musk?\nGod, I hope not. We get a lot of criticism for covering him so much, and yet\nby far most downloaded segments are when we talk about Elon Musk. He\u2019s a\nbrilliant man. But I\u2019m just sick of talking about him. I feel like a reporter\nin the 1990s talking about Monica Lewinsky. OK, we get it. Let\u2019s get on to\nsomething else.\n\nHe\u2019s going to continue to be in the news for a lot of reasons. One is his\npersonal behaviour. He can\u2019t seem to resist acting strange. Two, Tesla is\ngoing to go down in value, which will create a lot of headlines, and SpaceX\nand Starlink will go up in value. So yeah, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going anywhere.\n\nThe Algebra of Wealth by Scott Galloway is published by Torva (\u00a322).
