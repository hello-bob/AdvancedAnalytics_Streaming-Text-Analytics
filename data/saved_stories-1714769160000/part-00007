Of course, endlessly checking for information will\ntake up a lot of your time. You don't want to be aimlessly doom scrolling\nthrough competitor social media accounts or refreshing competitor websites\nwithout any clear benefit. On the other hand, there are real, significant\nbenefits for your business that come from a detailed awareness of your\ncompetition. Let's look at some of them in more detail.\n\nReason 1: Ideas for new product features\n\nYou should not blindly copy everything your competitors are doing, but being\naware of competitor product and product features can be helpful. Every product\nmanager knows how hard it is to easily generate new ideas for testing and\nbuilding; let your competitors do that.\n\nNew product features are hidden everywhere. For mobile apps, new additions in\nfunctionality are described in the version descriptions in Apple App Store and\nGoogle Play Store. For API-first products, the developer portal often contains\na \"Change log\" where you can see what changes have been implemented. Company\nemployees often brag about their latest contributions to their product on\ntheir X or Linkedin feeds.\n\nIf your competitor has a mobile app, always check out their Version History on\nApp Store\n\nYou don't have to come up with everything from scratch! Often it is easier to\njust look at what your competitors are doing - abandon the parts that are not\nconvincing, but implement the rest. Often, if a feature has been deployed\npublicly, it already has been tested internally or with a smaller group of\ntest customers.\n\nReason 2: Talent you should hire\n\nAttracting the right kind of talent can be a true pain for any executive or\nfounder, and getting this right usually is the main reason why your plans will\nfail or succeed. Even if you manage to identify talented people, it often\ntakes a lot of time to onboard them and educate them about your company, about\nyour industry and about your products.\n\nGuess what - your competitors are packed with talented people that already are\nworking on very similar problems as you. They often have a good understanding\nof your clients, your products, your market, your regulation and your other\nchallenges. Why not try to attract some of them?\n\nWe agree - it often is not easy approaching them cold, since your attempts\noften will not convert. But here is a small tip - people often leave their\njobs or are let go. Linkedin never sends you a notification about this (people\nare understandably shy about terminating their work), but you can use tools\nlike RivalSense to identify when your competitor employees have stopped\nworking with them and are ready to be approached by you or your HR team.\n\nIt's April 2024, and RivalSense informs you that this person no longer works\nfor your competitor. What do you do?\n\nOne thing that you should be aware of when poaching top talent from your\ncompetitors - some of them might have signed non-compete agreements or non-\ncompete clauses (NCC) that prevent them from working for a competitor of their\nprevious employer. That really depends on the jurisdiction where you are\noperating in. However, if you are based in US, you should be aware that FTC\nhas just banned non-competes and they are now an illegal practice. Any person\nyou approach should be aware if they have signed a legally binding non-\ncompete.\n\nReason 3: Pricing changes\n\nBe careful with this reason, since it does not apply in every industry. There\nare some industries where you should not be overly concerned with the pricing\nof your competitors, since your potential clients do not view it as one of\ntheir Main Purchasing Criteria. They might choose you because of your\nreputation, your product features or for some other reasons.\n\nHowever, there are some other industries where potential clients are extremely\nsensitive about your pricing, especially when compared to your competitors.\nThink of industries like payment gateways or cloud storage. Clients here are\ndemanding, and have a habit of shopping around before making their decision.\nIf your competitors have lowered their prices, and you have not adjusted\naccordingly, you can lose a lot of business until you are aware of what is\ngoing.\n\nCompetitors also often launch temporary discounts or introduce new pricing\nplans, like Team plans or Enterprise plans.\n\nWe recommend using a tool like RivalSense or others to track these changes in\nthe websites or Linkedin posts of your competitors, so you are never surprised\nby these changes.\n\nYou don't always have to copy pricing changes of your competitors, but it is\ngood to be aware of what is going on\n\nOnce you are aware of the pricing changes, you are in a position to make\nintelligent, informed decisions on whether you should adjust. As we mentioned\nbefore, you should think about the price-sensitivity of your customer.\n\nReason 4: Marketing and sales opportunities\n\nAll businesses and endlessly looking for customers, and closely following your\ncompetition can help you land new business.\n\nThe precise effects will depend on your business model, but let's assume you\nare a SaaS company landing many clients via direct B2B sales. In that case, an\nimportant part of landing deals is strategic prospecting - knowing who your\npotential clients are and knowing how can they be reached.\n\nTracking competitors can be useful. Firstly, you will see what conferences\ntheir sales people are attending, since there it is hard to find a sales\nperson these days that is not constantly posting on Linkedin. This conference\nis an opportunity to meet your potential clients. Secondly, you can see what\ntrade publications and blogs your competitors are doing content marketing in.\nThese publications or similar publications can be useful channels for\naddressing your future clients and educating them about your products.\n\nAre there any important industry events or content marketing channels that you\nare missing?\n\nThirdly, you can see whenever some client case study disappears from the\nwebsites of your competitors - if that happens, there is a good chance you can\nadd them to the list of your leads! Tools like RivalSense allow you to notice\nthese changes in competitor websites.\n\nSummary\n\nEvaluate whether tracking competitors makes sense for you. Of course,\nfollowing competitors can take up some of your time, but there are good tools\nthat can minimise this time investment - opening your inbox every week and\nscanning for interesting insights is not a big time investment. The benefits\nfor your business can be significant.\n\n## Sign up for more like this.\n\nEnter your email\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Welcome to RivalSense community\n\nWelcome to RivalSense, a tool for receiving curated weekly updates on your\ncompetitors!
