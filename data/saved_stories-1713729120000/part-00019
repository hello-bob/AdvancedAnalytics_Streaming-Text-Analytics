Animal consciousness needs a rethink\n\nA declaration signed by dozens of scientists says there is \u201ca realistic\npossibility\u201d for elements of consciousness in reptiles, insects and molluscs.\n\nBy\n\n  * Mariana Lenharo\n\n  1.

And the list does not end with\nvertebrates. Researchers are expanding their investigations of consciousness\nto a wider range of animals, including octopuses and even bees and flies.\n\nArmed with such research, a coalition of scientists is calling for a rethink\nin the animal\u2013human relationship. If there\u2019s \u201ca realistic possibility\u201d of\n\u201cconscious experience in an animal, it is irresponsible to ignore that\npossibility in decisions affecting that animal\u201d, the researchers write in a\ndocument they call The New York Declaration of Animal Consciousness. Issued\ntoday during a meeting in New York City, the declaration also says that there\nis a \u201crealistic possibility of conscious experience\u201d in reptiles, fish,\ninsects and other animals that have not always been considered to have inner\nlives, and \u201cstrong scientific support\u201d for aspects of consciousness in birds\nand mammals.\n\nAs the evidence has accumulated, scientists are \u201ctaking the topic seriously,\nnot dismissing it out of hand as a crazy idea in the way they might have in\nthe past,\u201d says Jonathan Birch, a philosopher at the London School of\nEconomics and Political Science and one of the authors of the declaration.\n\nThe document, which had around 40 signatories early today, doesn\u2019t state that\nthere are definitive answers about which species are conscious. \u201cWhat it says\nis there is sufficient evidence out there such that there\u2019s a realistic\npossibility of some kinds of conscious experiences in species even quite\ndistinct from humans,\u201d says Anil Seth, director of the Centre for\nConsciousness Science at the University of Sussex near Brighton, UK, and one\nof the signatories. The authors hope that others will sign the declaration and\nthat it will stimulate both more research into animal consciousness and more\nfunding for the field.\n\n## Blurry line\n\nThe definition of consciousness is complex, but the group focuses on an aspect\nof consciousness called sentience, often defined as the capacity to have\nsubjective experiences, says Birch. For an animal, such experiences would\ninclude smelling, tasting, hearing or touching the world around itself, as\nwell as feeling fear, pleasure or pain \u2014 in essence, what it is like to be\nthat animal. But subjective experience does not require the capacity to think\nabout one\u2019s experiences.\n\nThe consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?\n\nNon-human animals cannot use words to communicate their inner states. To\nassess consciousness in these animals, scientists often rely on indirect\nevidence, looking for certain behaviours that are associated with conscious\nexperiences, Birch says.\n\nOne classic experiment is the mirror test, which investigates an animal\u2019s\nability to recognize itself in a mirror. In this experiment, scientists apply\na sticker or other visual mark on an animal\u2019s body and place the animal in\nfront of a mirror. Some animals \u2014 including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)^1,\nAsian elephants (Elephas maximus)^2 and cleaner fishes (Labroides\ndimidiatus)^3 \u2014 exhibit curiosity about the mark and even try to remove it.\nThis behaviour suggests the possibility of self-awareness, which might be a\nsign of consciousness.\n\nIn an experiment with crows (Corvus corone)^4, the birds were trained to make\na specific head gesture whenever they saw a coloured square on a screen, a\ntask they carried out with high accuracy. While the birds performed the task,\nscientists measured the activity in a region of their brain associated with\nhigh-level cognition. The birds\u2019 brain activity correlated with what the birds\nwere reporting, not with what they were actually shown. This suggests that\nthey were aware of what they were perceiving, another potential marker of\nconsciousness.\n\n## Invertebrate inner lives?\n\nAnother experiment showed that octopuses (Octopus bocki)^5, when picking\nbetween two chambers, avoided one where they had previously received a painful\nstimulus in favour of one where they were given an anaesthetic. This suggests\nthat they experience and actively avoid pain, which some researchers think\nindicates conscious experience.\n\nInvestigations of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) show that they engage\nin both deep sleep and \u2018active sleep\u2019, in which their brain activity is the\nsame as when they\u2019re awake^6. \u201cThis is perhaps similar to what we call rapid\neye movement sleep in humans, which is when we have our most vivid dreams,\nwhich we interpret as conscious experiences,\u201d says Bruno van Swinderen, a\nbiologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, who studies\nfruit flies\u2019 behaviour and who also signed the declaration.\n\nSome suggest that dreams are key components of being conscious, he notes. If\nflies and other invertebrates have active sleep, \u201cthen maybe this is as good a\nclue as any that they are perhaps conscious\u201d.\n\n## Animal minds\n\nOther researchers are more sceptical about the available evidence on animal\nconsciousness. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is basically any decisive evidence so\nfar,\u201d says Hakwan Lau, a neuroscientist at the Riken Center for Brain Science\nin Wako, Japan.\n\nLau acknowledges that there is a growing body of work showing sophisticated\nperceptual behaviour in animals, but he contends that that\u2019s not necessarily\nindicative of consciousness. In humans, for example, there is both conscious\nand unconscious perception. The challenge now is to develop methods that can\nadequately distinguish between the two in non-humans.\n\nSeth responds that, even in the absence of definitive answers, the declaration\nmight still have a positive influence in shaping policies relating to animal\nethics and welfare.\n\nFor van Swinderen, the time is right to consider whether most animals might be\nconscious. \u201cWe are experiencing an artificial-intelligence revolution where\nsimilar questions are being asked about machines. So it behoves us to ask if\nand how this adaptive quality of the brain might have evolved in nature.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01144-y\n\n## References\n\n  1. Gallup Jr, G. G.
