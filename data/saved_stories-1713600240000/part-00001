October 10-11, 2023.\n\n# A cross-platform native runtime for web apps.\n\nCapacitor is an open source native runtime for building Web Native apps.\nCreate cross-platform iOS, Android, and Progressive Web Apps with JavaScript,\nHTML, and CSS.\n\nInstall Capacitor \u2192Explore Plugins\n\nMigrate from Cordova \u2192\n\n## Get started easily.\n\n01\n\n### Drop Capacitor into any existing web app.\n\n    \n    \n    npm install @capacitor/cli @capacitor/core\n    \n    npx cap init\n\n02\n\n### Install the native platforms you want to target.\n\n    \n    \n    npm install @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android\n    \n    npx cap add ios\n    \n    npx cap add android\n\n03\n\n### Access core Native APIs or extend with your own.\n\nCapacitor\u2019s native plugin APIs make it extremely easy to access and invoke\ncommon device functionality across multiple platforms.\n\n    \n    \n    import { LocalNotifications } from '@capacitor/local-notifications';\n    \n    LocalNotifications.schedule({\n    \n    notifications: [\n    \n    {\n    \n    title: \"On sale\",\n    \n    body: \"Widgets are 10% off.

We wrote a free guide on when and\nwhy to use Capacitor to build cross-platform apps.\n\n## Connect web apps to native functionality.\n\n#### Universal apps\n\nBuild web-based applications that run equally well across iOS, Android, and as\nProgressive Web Apps.\n\n#### Native access\n\nAccess the full Native SDKs on each platform, and easily deploy to the App\nStores (and the web).\n\n#### Native PWAs\n\nAdd custom native functionality with a simple Plugin API, or use existing\nCordova plugins with our compatibility layer.\n\n## Cross-platform, core native plugins.\n\nExplore APIs \u2192\n\n#### Camera\n\nCapture images, save photos, and configure hardware parameters like saturation\nand color balance.\n\n#### File System\n\nSave and read documents, assets, and other content your users need to access\nvia native file systems.\n\n#### Geolocation\n\nGather critical information about a user\u2019s device location, such as latitude\nand longitude.\n\n#### Accelerometer\n\nAccess the device accelerometer sensors to measures changes in velocity of a\ndevice motion.\n\n#### Notifications\n\nSchedule local notifications on the device or handle push notifications sent\nfrom a server.\n\n#### Network\n\nMonitor for network connectivity and capability changes to build resilient\noffline apps.\n\n#### Haptics\n\nAdd physical feedback through haptic features available on modern devices.\n\n#### Your Own Plugin\n\nWrite your own custom plugins to access specialty features and easily\nintegrate any 3rd-party SDK.\n\n## Bring your own web framework.\n\nDrop Capacitor into any existing web project, framework or library. Convert an\nexisting React, Svelte, Vue (or your preferred Web Framework) project to\nnative mobile.\n\n## What people are saying about Capacitor.\n\n### Austin Howard\n\n@a_howard8\n\nI\u2019m reallllyyyy digging capacitor \ud83d\udc40\n\n### Angular\n\n@angular\n\nDid you know @capacitorjs shows how to give your #Angular app access to mobile\nAPIs and a presence in app stores?\n\n### scriptkitty\n\n@thr0wsException\n\nI'm pretty hyped to be honest, from what I've seen so far this will be another\nmajor step for establishing web technology as the go-to method for developing\ncross platform apps \u2665\n\n### Adeniyi Tolulope\n\n@tolutronics\n\n@capacitorjs has been a great companion this year... with realtime updates.\n\n### Guillermo Rauch\n\n@rauchg\n\nAmazing that this is @vercel Next.js + @tailwindcss + @capacitorjs \ud83e\udd2f\n\n### Carlos Martinez\n\n@cmartineztech\n\nYes, It works \ud83d\ude31 deep linking and google native authentication in iOS\n@capacitorjs\n\n### Greg Marine\n\n@gregmarine\n\nOne of the nice things about Capacitor is that you don\u2019t have to use Ionic. I\npersonally love Ionic and use it for UI components. But it isn\u2019t required for\nCapacitor \ud83d\ude0a\n\n### Jacob Clark\n\n@imjacobclark\n\nWe blogged about how we use Capacitor to build our 4 Children\u2019s apps at the\n@BBC\n\n### Dayana Jabif\n\n@dayujabif\n\nI still can't believe how easy is to turn an @Ionicframework app into a native\niOS app using @capacitorjs \ud83e\udd2f\n\n### Leo\n\n@creativiii\n\nI've tried React Native but coming from web dev the DX is such a step down.\nGive @capacitorjs a go if you're building apps \ud83d\udc40\n\n### Tim S\n\n@tdawgpharaoh\n\nI am asking myself, how did I not hear about @capacitorjs until recently. Very\nnice.\n\n### Daniel Rodrigues\n\n@inspire_rd\n\nTried out @capacitorjs soon after it went stable - amazing! Simple & straight\nforward.\n\n\ud83d\udc4b\n\nThe Capacitor Community is growing.
