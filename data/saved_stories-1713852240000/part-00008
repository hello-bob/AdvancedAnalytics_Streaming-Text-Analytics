This has led to some anxiety among space scientists, who view the Mars\nSample Return (MSR) mission as a cornerstone of plans to explore the Solar\nSystem.\n\nBut when you consider what\u2019s at stake, scientifically and politically, it\nseems highly likely that Nasa will push ahead with the mission to make it a\nsuccess.\n\nOne key conclusion of the Nasa review is that MSR was established with\nunrealistic budget and schedules. Now it expects a cost of US$8-11 billion\n(\u00a36.5-8.9 billion), having originally estimated $5.3 billion. That\u2019s not\nincluding the investment that the European Space Agency (Esa) is making, which\nis probably of the order of \u20ac2 billion (\u00a31.7 billion).\n\nThere are also concerns that the timeline for return of the drill cores to\nEarth may slip in to the 2040s, and therefore start holding up the even more\nambitious vision for human missions to Mars.\n\nDespite these obstacles, Nasa remains committed to MSR as one of its highest\nscience priorities. In fact, it remains the agency\u2019s highest priority of the\ndecade for planetary science.\n\nNasa puts great emphasis on delivering what its ten-year surveys of the\ncommunity propose \u2013 and it would be loath to abandon the recommendations. Esa\nis also unlikely to want to lose the scientific investment it has already made\nin MSR.\n\n## Huge scientific importance\n\nSo why does the space science community regard MSR as so important? Partly\nbecause the technologies are a stepping stone to future human exploration. For\ninstance, the mission needs an ascent vehicle to launch the samples into orbit\nfor capture by another spacecraft.\n\nCylinder of rock the size inside the drill of Perseverance rover. Nasa\n\nPerseverance is already doing the first key stage of this mission \u2013 drilling\nin Jezero Crater. This is stage one of four. The next two stages will be to\ngather at least some of the drilled samples and launch them on a Mars ascent\nvehicle into orbit for capture by Esa\u2019s Return Orbiter. That capture in Mars\norbit of a football-sized return capsule is one of the key technical\nchallenges of MSR. Esa is taking a major part in this and leads the return\norbiter development.\n\nThe final stage, assuming successful landing at the Utah Test and Training\nRange, is a painstaking programme of organic, geochemical and mineralogical\nanalyses will take place under stringent conditions of containment. This stage\nwill deploy the very best equipment that we scientists have in laboratories\nacross the world.\n\nBut these challenging steps come at a cost, which Nasa is now proposing to\nreduce. For example, it may reduce the mass of an ascent vehicle. And it has\nalready dropped a planned UK-built Fetch rover to gather up drilled samples.\nEven the option of using helicopters as demonstrated by Ingenuity on Mars2020\nis at risk \u2013 it may be Perseverance itself that delivers the drill tubes to an\nascent rocket.\n\nBut these financial savings come with a scientific cost. Fewer of the\ncurrently envisaged 30 drill cores (each of the rock cores inside the 15cm\ntubes are about 6cm long) would be returned in that scenario to keep the\nascent vehicle light.\n\nThe actual samples from an ancient delta, and a thick lava flow that has\npreserved traces of alteration by hot water, being drilled in Jezero Crater\nhave been stored on board or dropped at a depot. These precious cores\nrepresent the results of past Mars orbiter and lander missions, telling us\nwhere to land and making accurate predictions of what we would find.\n\nUltimately, the samples waiting for return to Earth offer our best chance in\nthe near future of identifying traces of ancient life beyond our own planet.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more pressing task for space science.\n\nIf Perseverance continues to work successfully \u2013 and its 12-year-old sibling\nrover, Curiosity, that I work on suggests it will \u2013 then we have the enticing\nprospect of sampling the rim of Jezero Crater. This is a window into a new\ntype of environment in Mars exploration: the excavated deep crust where\nancient microbial life may have been shielded from the harsh surface\nradiation.\n\n## Chinese rivalry\n\nThere is another, less scientifically driven, reason that Nasa and Esa will be\nkeen to maintain their records of success in Mars exploration.\n\nThe Apollo programme was given impetus by cold war rivalry with the Soviet\nUnion. Tragically, new collaboration with the Russian space agency Roscomos,\nand the full potential for space exploration that could be realised in a more\npeaceful geopolitical environment, is not currently possible.\n\nRoscosmos could no longer mount a credible MSR mission on its own. The Esa\nrover Rosalind Franklin was scheduled to be launched on a Soyuz rocket in\n2023, but after the Ukraine invasion that mission was quickly rethought.\n\nChina now has credible plans for a Mars Sample Return mission called\nTianwen-3. The Chinese Space Agency wants to launch in 2028, with separate\nlander and ascent vehicle launches. If that challenging timeline can really be\nachieved, then samples could be returned to Earth by 2031.\n\nIn 2020, I argued that an era of new Chinese collaboration with the west could\nbe possible. But four years on, I wonder if the history of rivalry may be\nrepeating itself.\n\nMSR is needed to address some of our most important questions about Mars and\nhabitable environments beyond Earth. But it also looks set to become another\nsymbol of rivalry in space. That said, it may be an important reason why it\nwill indeed be a success.\n\n  * NASA\n  * Mars\n  * European Space Agency (ESA)\n  * Alien life\n  * Give me perspective\n  * Search for alien life\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Senior Lecturer - Earth System Science\n\n  * ##### Operations Coordinator\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
