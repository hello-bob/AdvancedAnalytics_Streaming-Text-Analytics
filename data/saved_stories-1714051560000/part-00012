Both sides are in discussions to resolve the\ninvestigation, one of the people said.\n\nInvestigations are not evidence of wrongdoing and officials conducting the\ninquiry could ultimately pursue criminal charges, seek civil sanctions or\nclose the probe without taking any action. The Wall Street Journal previously\nreported the justice department investigation.\n\nThe justice department probe underscores how McKinsey\u2019s past work advising\ndrugmakers on opioids continues to follow the near-century-old consulting\nfirm. It carries higher stakes than other government investigations McKinsey\nhas resolved because of the potential for criminal charges against the company\nor executives, and steep financial penalties that the justice department often\ndemands in exchange for resolving its white-collar probes.\n\nMcKinsey earlier reached separate agreements totaling nearly $1 bn to settle\nwidespread opioid lawsuits and other related legal actions brought by all 50\nstates, Washington DC, US territories, various local governments, school\ndistricts, Native American tribes and health insurers.\n\nMcKinsey in 2019 said it would no longer advise clients on any opioid-related\nbusinesses. None of the settlements have contained admissions of liability or\nwrongdoing, McKinsey has said.\n\n\u201cWe understand and accept the scrutiny around our past client service to\nopioid manufacturers. This work, while lawful, fell short of the high\nstandards we set for ourselves,\u201d McKinsey said in a 2022 statement following\nthe release of a congressional committee report scrutinizing its consulting\nwork.\n\nPurdue did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The drugmaker\npleaded guilty in 2020 to criminal charges over its handling of opioid\npainkillers. Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 and later negotiated a\nsettlement valued at about $10bn to settle thousands of lawsuits alleging it\ncontributed to the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe supreme court halted that settlement and is soon expected to rule on a\nBiden administration challenge to the deal.\n\nProsecutors are far from making any charging decisions in their criminal\ninvestigation of McKinsey, in part because they are sifting through voluminous\ndocuments as part of their inquiry and engaging in discussions with the\nconsulting firm\u2019s lawyers, one of the people said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US news\n  * Opioids crisis\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
