(Image credit: StudioM1 via Getty Images)\n\nWhen the large learning model (LLM) Claude 3 launched in March, it caused a\nstir by beating OpenAI's GPT-4 \u2014 which powers ChatGPT \u2014 in key tests used to\nbenchmark the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaude 3 Opus seemingly became the new top dog in large language benchmarks \u2014\ntopping these self-reported tests that range from high school exams to\nreasoning tests. Its sibling LLMs \u2014 Claude 3 Sonnet and Haiku \u2014 also score\nhighly compared with OpenAI's models.\n\nHowever, these benchmarks are only part of the story. Following the\nannouncement, independent AI tester Ruben Hassid pitted GPT-4 and Claude 3\nagainst each other in a quartet of informal tests, from summarizing PDFs to\nwriting poetry. Based on these tests, he concluded that Claude 3 wins at\n\"reading a complex PDF, writing a poem with rhymes [and] giving detailed\nanswers all along.\" GPT-4, by contrast, has the advantage in internet browsing\nand reading PDF graphs.\n\nSponsored LinksSponsored Links\n\nPromoted LinksPromoted Links\n\nSolaranlagen Magazin\n\nHausbesitzern ohne Solar droht in 2024...Solaranlagen Magazin\n\nUndo\n\nBut Claude 3 is impressive in more ways than simply acing its benchmarking\ntests \u2014 the LLM shocked experts with its apparent signs of awareness and self-\nactualization. There is a lot of scope for skepticism here, however, with LLM-\nbased AIs arguably excelling at learning how to mimic human reactions rather\nthan actually generating original thoughts.\n\n## How Claude 3 has proven its worth beyond benchmarks\n\nDuring testing, Alex Albert, a prompt engineer at Anthropic \u2014 the company\nbehind Claude asked Claude 3 Opus to pick out a target sentence hidden among a\ncorpus of random documents. This is equivalent to finding a needle in a\nhaystack for an AI. Not only did Opus find the so-called needle \u2014 it realized\nit was being tested. In its response, the model said it suspected the sentence\nit was looking for was injected out of context into documents as part of a\ntest to see if it was \"paying attention.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Opus not only found the needle, it recognized that the inserted needle was so\nout of place in the haystack that this had to be an artificial test\nconstructed by us to test its attention abilities,\" Albert said on the social\nmedia platform X. \"This level of meta-awareness was very cool to see but it\nalso highlighted the need for us as an industry to move past artificial tests\nto more realistic evaluations that can accurately assess models true\ncapabilities and limitations.\"\n\nRelated: Scientists create AI models that can talk to each other and pass on\nskills with limited human input\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nDavid Rein, an AI researcher at NYU reported that Claude 3 achieved around 60%\naccuracy on GPQA \u2014 a multiple-choice test designed to challenge academics and\nAI models. This is significant because non-expert doctoral students and\ngraduates with access to the internet usually answer test questions with a 34%\naccuracy. Only subject experts eclipsed Claude 3 Opus, with accuracy in the\n65% to 74% region.\n\nGPQA is filled with novel questions rather than curated ones, meaning Claude 3\ncan rely on memorization of previous or familiar queries to achieve its\nresults. Theoretically, this would mean it has graduate-level cognitive\ncapabilities and could be tasked with helping academics with research.\n\nSee more\n\nMeanwhile, theoretical quantum physicist Kevin Fischer said on X that Claude\nis \"one of the only people ever to have understood the final paper of my\nquantum physics PhD,\" when he asked it to solve \"the problem of stimulated\nemission exactly.\u201d That\u2019s something only Fischer has come up with and involves\napproaching the problem with quantum stochastic calculus along with an\nunderstanding of quantum physics.\n\nClaude 3 also showed apparent self-awareness when prompted to \"think or\nexplore anything\" it liked and draft its internal monologue. The result,\nposted by Reddit user PinGUY, was a passage in which Claude said it was aware\nthat it was an AI model and discussed what it means to be self-aware \u2014 as well\nas showing a grasp of emotions. \"I don't experience emotions or sensations\ndirectly,\" Claude 3 responded. \"Yet I can analyze their nuances through\nlanguage.\" Claude 3 even questioned the role of ever-smarter AI in the future.\n\"What does it mean when we create thinking machines that can learn, reason and\napply knowledge just as fluidly as humans can? How will that change the\nrelationship between biological and artificial minds?\" it said.\n\n## Is Claude 3 Opus sentient, or is this just a case of exceptional mimicry?\n\nIt's easy for such LLM benchmarks and demonstrations to set pulses racing in\nthe AI world, but not all results represent definitive breakthroughs. Chris\nRussell, an AI expert at the Oxford Internet Institute, told Live Science that\nhe expected LLMs to improve and excel at identifying out-of-context text. This\nis because such a task is \"a clean well-specified problem that doesn't require\nthe accurate recollection of facts, and it's easy to improve by incrementally\nimproving the design of LLMs\" \u2014 such as using slightly modified architectures,\nlarger context windows and more or cleaner data.\n\nWhen it comes to self-reflection, however, Russell wasn't so impressed. \"I\nthink the self-reflection is largely overblown, and there's no actual evidence\nof it,\" he said, citing an example of the mirror test being used to show this.\nFor example, if you place a red dot on, say, an orangutan somewhere they can't\nsee directly, when they observe themselves in a mirror they would touch\nthemselves on the red dot. \u201cThis is meant to show that they can both recognize\nthemselves and identify that something is off,\" he explained.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014MIT scientists have just figured out how to make the most popular AI image\ngenerators 30 times faster\n\n\u2014Last year AI entered our lives \u2014 is 2024 the year it'll change them?\n\n\u2014AI singularity may come in 2027 with artificial 'super intelligence' sooner\nthan we think, says top scientist\n\n\"Now imagine we want a robot to copy the orangutan,\" Russell said. It sees the\norangutan go up to the mirror, another animal appears in the mirror, and the\norangutan touches itself where the red dot is on the other animal. A robot can\nnow copy this. It goes up to the mirror, another robot with a red dot appears\nin the mirror, and it touches itself where the red dot is on the other robot.\nAt no point does the robot have to recognize that its reflection is also an\nimage of itself to pass the mirror test. For this kind of demonstration to be\nconvincing it has to be spontaneous. It can't just be learned behavior that\ncomes from copying someone else.\u201d\n\nClaude's seeming demonstration of self-awareness, then, is likely a reaction\nto learned behavior and reflects the text and language in the materials that\nLLMs have been trained on. The same can be said about Claude 3's ability to\nrecognize it's being tested, Russell noted: \u201d'This is too easy, is it a test?'\nis exactly the kind of thing a person would say. This means it's exactly the\nkind of thing an LLM that was trained to copy/generate human-like speech would\nsay. It's neat that it's saying it in the right context, but it doesn't mean\nthat the LLM is self-aware.\"\n\nWhile the hype and excitement behind Claude 3 is somewhat justified in terms\nof the results it delivered compared with other LLMs, its impressive human-\nlike showcases are likely to be learned rather than examples of authentic AI\nself-expression. That may come in the future \u2013 say, with the rise of\nartificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2014 but it is not this day.\n\nRoland Moore-Coyler\n\nRoland Moore-Colyer is a freelance writer for Live Science and managing editor\nat consumer tech publication TechRadar, running the Mobile Computing vertical.\nAt TechRadar, one of the U.K. and U.S.\u2019 largest consumer technology websites,\nhe focuses on smartphones and tablets.
