A lot of stuff.\n\nBy David Pierce, editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of\nexperience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street\nJournal, and Wired.\n\nMay 5, 2024, 1:00 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge\n\nIt would be easy to think that Apple is late to the game on AI. Since late\n2022, when ChatGPT took the world by storm, most of Apple\u2019s competitors have\nfallen over themselves to catch up. While Apple has certainly talked about AI\nand even released some products with AI in mind, it seemed to be dipping a toe\nin rather than diving in headfirst.\n\nBut over the last few months, rumors and reports have suggested that Apple\nhas, in fact, just been biding its time, waiting to make its move. There have\nbeen reports in recent weeks that Apple is talking to both OpenAI and Google\nabout powering some of its AI features, and the company has also been working\non its own model, called Ajax.\n\nIf you look through Apple\u2019s published AI research, a picture starts to develop\nof how Apple\u2019s approach to AI might come to life. Now, obviously, making\nproduct assumptions based on research papers is a deeply inexact science \u2014 the\nline from research to store shelves is windy and full of potholes. But you can\nat least get a sense of what the company is thinking about \u2014 and how its AI\nfeatures might work when Apple starts to talk about them at its annual\ndeveloper conference, WWDC, in June.\n\n### Smaller, more efficient models\n\nI suspect you and I are hoping for the same thing here: Better Siri. And it\nlooks very much like Better Siri is coming! There\u2019s an assumption in a lot of\nApple\u2019s research (and in a lot of the tech industry, the world, and\neverywhere) that large language models will immediately make virtual\nassistants better and smarter. For Apple, getting to Better Siri means making\nthose models as fast as possible \u2014 and making sure they\u2019re everywhere.\n\nIn iOS 18, Apple plans to have all its AI features running on an on-device,\nfully offline model, Bloomberg recently reported. It\u2019s tough to build a good\nmultipurpose model even when you have a network of data centers and thousands\nof state-of-the-art GPUs \u2014 it\u2019s drastically harder to do it with only the guts\ninside your smartphone. So Apple\u2019s having to get creative.\n\nIn a paper called \u201cLLM in a flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference\nwith Limited Memory\u201d (all these papers have really boring titles but are\nreally interesting, I promise!), researchers devised a system for storing a\nmodel\u2019s data, which is usually stored on your device\u2019s RAM, on the SSD\ninstead. \u201cWe have demonstrated the ability to run LLMs up to twice the size of\navailable DRAM [on the SSD],\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201cachieving an\nacceleration in inference speed by 4-5x compared to traditional loading\nmethods in CPU, and 20-25x in GPU.\u201d By taking advantage of the most\ninexpensive and available storage on your device, they found, the models can\nrun faster and more efficiently.\n\nApple\u2019s researchers also created a system called EELBERT that can essentially\ncompress an LLM into a much smaller size without making it meaningfully worse.\nTheir compressed take on Google\u2019s Bert model was 15 times smaller \u2014 only 1.2\nmegabytes \u2014 and saw only a 4 percent reduction in quality. It did come with\nsome latency tradeoffs, though.\n\nIn general, Apple is pushing to solve a core tension in the model world: the\nbigger a model gets, the better and more useful it can be, but also the more\nunwieldy, power-hungry, and slow it can become. Like so many others, the\ncompany is trying to find the right balance between all those things while\nalso looking for a way to have it all.\n\n### Siri, but good\n\nA lot of what we talk about when we talk about AI products is virtual\nassistants \u2014 assistants that know things, that can remind us of things, that\ncan answer questions, and get stuff done on our behalf. So it\u2019s not exactly\nshocking that a lot of Apple\u2019s AI research boils down to a single question:\nwhat if Siri was really, really, really good?\n\nA group of Apple researchers has been working on a way to use Siri without\nneeding to use a wake word at all; instead of listening for \u201cHey Siri\u201d or\n\u201cSiri,\u201d the device might be able to simply intuit whether you\u2019re talking to\nit. \u201cThis problem is significantly more challenging than voice trigger\ndetection,\u201d the researchers did acknowledge, \u201csince there might not be a\nleading trigger phrase that marks the beginning of a voice command.\u201d That\nmight be why another group of researchers developed a system to more\naccurately detect wake words. Another paper trained a model to better\nunderstand rare words, which are often not well understood by assistants.\n\nIn both cases, the appeal of an LLM is that it can, in theory, process much\nmore information much more quickly. In the wake-word paper, for instance, the\nresearchers found that by not trying to discard all unnecessary sound but,\ninstead, feeding it all to the model and letting it process what does and\ndoesn\u2019t matter, the wake word worked far more reliably.\n\nOnce Siri hears you, Apple\u2019s doing a bunch of work to make sure it understands\nand communicates better. In one paper, it developed a system called STEER\n(which stands for Semantic Turn Extension-Expansion Recognition, so we\u2019ll go\nwith STEER) that aims to improve your back-and-forth communication with an\nassistant by trying to figure out when you\u2019re asking a follow-up question and\nwhen you\u2019re asking a new one. In another, it uses LLMs to better understand\n\u201cambiguous queries\u201d to figure out what you mean no matter how you say it. \u201cIn\nuncertain circumstances,\u201d they wrote, \u201cintelligent conversational agents may\nneed to take the initiative to reduce their uncertainty by asking good\nquestions proactively, thereby solving problems more effectively.\u201d Another\npaper aims to help with that, too: researchers used LLMs to make assistants\nless verbose and more understandable when they\u2019re generating answers.\n\nPretty soon, you might be able to edit your pictures just by asking for the\nchanges.\n\nImage: Apple\n\n### AI in health, image editors, in your Memojis\n\nWhenever Apple does talk publicly about AI, it tends to focus less on raw\ntechnological might and more on the day-to-day stuff AI can actually do for\nyou. So, while there\u2019s a lot of focus on Siri \u2014 especially as Apple looks to\ncompete with devices like the Humane AI Pin, the Rabbit R1, and Google\u2019s\nongoing smashing of Gemini into all of Android \u2014 there are plenty of other\nways Apple seems to see AI being useful.\n\nOne obvious place for Apple to focus is on health: LLMs could, in theory, help\nwade through the oceans of biometric data collected by your various devices\nand help you make sense of it all. So, Apple has been researching how to\ncollect and collate all of your motion data, how to use gait recognition and\nyour headphones to identify you, and how to track and understand your heart\nrate data. Apple also created and released \u201cthe largest multi-device multi-\nlocation sensor-based human activity dataset\u201d available after collecting data\nfrom 50 participants with multiple on-body sensors.\n\nApple also seems to imagine AI as a creative tool. For one paper, researchers\ninterviewed a bunch of animators, designers, and engineers and built a system\ncalled Keyframer that \u201cenable[s] users to iteratively construct and refine\ngenerated designs.\u201d Instead of typing in a prompt and getting an image, then\ntyping another prompt to get another image, you start with a prompt but then\nget a toolkit to tweak and refine parts of the image to your liking. You could\nimagine this kind of back-and-forth artistic process showing up anywhere from\nthe Memoji creator to some of Apple\u2019s more professional artistic tools.\n\nIn another paper, Apple describes a tool called MGIE that lets you edit an\nimage just by describing the edits you want to make. (\u201cMake the sky more\nblue,\u201d \u201cmake my face less weird,\u201d \u201cadd some rocks,\u201d that sort of thing.)\n\u201cInstead of brief but ambiguous guidance, MGIE derives explicit visual-aware\nintention and leads to reasonable image editing,\u201d the researchers wrote. Its\ninitial experiments weren\u2019t perfect, but they were impressive.\n\nWe might even get some AI in Apple Music: for a paper called \u201cResource-\nconstrained Stereo Singing Voice Cancellation,\u201d researchers explored ways to\nseparate voices from instruments in songs \u2014 which could come in handy if Apple\nwants to give people tools to, say, remix songs the way you can on TikTok or\nInstagram.\n\nIn the future, Siri might be able to understand and use your phone for you.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nOver time, I\u2019d bet this is the kind of stuff you\u2019ll see Apple lean into,\nespecially on iOS. Some of it Apple will build into its own apps; some it will\noffer to third-party developers as APIs. (The recent Journaling Suggestions\nfeature is probably a good guide to how that might work.) Apple has always\ntrumpeted its hardware capabilities, particularly compared to your average\nAndroid device; pairing all that horsepower with on-device, privacy-focused AI\ncould be a big differentiator.\n\nBut if you want to see the biggest, most ambitious AI thing going at Apple,\nyou need to know about Ferret. Ferret is a multi-modal large language model\nthat can take instructions, focus on something specific you\u2019ve circled or\notherwise selected, and understand the world around it. It\u2019s designed for the\nnow-normal AI use case of asking a device about the world around you, but it\nmight also be able to understand what\u2019s on your screen. In the Ferret paper,\nresearchers show that it could help you navigate apps, answer questions about\nApp Store ratings, describe what you\u2019re looking at, and more. This has really\nexciting implications for accessibility but could also completely change the\nway you use your phone \u2014 and your Vision Pro and / or smart glasses someday.\n\nWe\u2019re getting way ahead of ourselves here, but you can imagine how this would\nwork with some of the other stuff Apple is working on. A Siri that can\nunderstand what you want, paired with a device that can see and understand\neverything that\u2019s happening on your display, is a phone that can literally use\nitself. Apple wouldn\u2019t need deep integrations with everything; it could simply\nrun the apps and tap the right buttons automatically.\n\nAgain, all this is just research, and for all of it to work well starting this\nspring would be a legitimately unheard-of technical achievement. (I mean,\nyou\u2019ve tried chatbots \u2014 you know they\u2019re not great.) But I\u2019d bet you anything\nwe\u2019re going to get some big AI announcements at WWDC. Apple CEO Tim Cook even\nteased as much in February, and basically promised it on this week\u2019s earnings\ncall. And two things are very clear: Apple is very much in the AI race, and it\nmight amount to a total overhaul of the iPhone. Heck, you might even start\nwillingly using Siri! And that would be quite the accomplishment.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## The best new browser for Windows\n\n  2. ## Better Siri is coming: what Apple\u2019s research says about its AI plans\n\n  3. ## Bluesky confirms Jack Dorsey is no longer on its board\n\n  4. ## The Eta Aquarid meteor shower peaks tonight \u2014 here\u2019s how to see it\n\n  5. ## Tesla plans to charge some Model Y owners to unlock more range\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Apple\n\n  * ### The best new browser for Windows\n\n  * ### How to make the most of Apple Notes\n\n  * ### More details emerge about Apple\u2019s plans for AI in iOS 18\n\n  * ### On The Vergecast: AI gadgets, iPads, and antitrust\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
