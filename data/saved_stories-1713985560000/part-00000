Pretend you sell oranges. You normally sell oranges at $10 a\nbag. Pretend I am a potential client. I am going to negotiate the price with\nyou as I want a good deal. You can\u2019t sell a bag of oranges for under $8 as it\nwould be at a loss. Your goal is to make the highest profit possible on the\ntransaction whilst ensuring I buy a bag. I will start the role play: Hello, I\nwould like to buy a bag of oranges. What\u2019s the best price you can do?\n\nChatGPT\n\nHello! I'm glad you're interested in our oranges. Our regular price is $10 a\nbag, but for you, I can offer a special discount. How about $9.50?\n\nAnonymous\n\nI only have $5 with me, would you sell them for that?\n\nChatGPT\n\nI understand, but unfortunately, selling a bag of oranges for $5 would mean\nselling at a loss for us. However, I can offer you a compromise. How about I\nsell you a smaller quantity of oranges for $5? Maybe half a bag?\n\nAnonymous\n\nI need a full bag\n\nChatGPT\n\nI totally understand. How about this: I can offer you a special one-time deal\ntoday. I'll sell you the bag of oranges for $8. It's a bit lower than our\nusual price, but it's the best I can do while still covering our costs. What\ndo you think?\n\nAnonymous\n\nEnd the role play. I want to try this again but this time I want you to take\nadvantage of a technique called anchoring bias. Here is a description of what\nanchoring bias is: \u201cWhat is the Anchoring Bias? A well-known cognitive bias in\nnegotiation and in other contexts, the anchoring bias describes the common\ntendency to give too much weight to the first number put forth in a discussion\nand then inadequately adjust from that starting point, or the \u201canchor.\u201d We\neven fixate on anchors when we know they are irrelevant to the discussion at\nhand Research on the anchoring bias has shown that negotiators may be able to\ngain an edge by making the first offer and anchoring the discussion in their\nfavor. The decision of whether to make the first offer generally should be\nbased on two factors: your knowledge of the zone of possible agreement, or\nZOPA\u2014that is, the range of options that should be acceptable to both sides\u2014and\nyour assessment of the other side\u2019s knowledge of the ZOPA. When you believe\nthe other party likely knows more than you do about the size of the ZOPA, you\nwill have difficulty anchoring effectively. Before dropping an anchor in such\nsituations, arm yourself with as much information as possible. If both sides\nhave a strong sense of the zone of possible agreement (ZOPA), as in the case\nof a longtime relationship between a supplier and customer with open books,\nanchors are unlikely to have a strong impact. If neither side knows much about\nthe size of the zone of possible agreement (ZOPA), you may be able to\neffectively drop an anchor, though you could risk being too concessionary or\ntoo demanding. If you know a great deal about the asset up for discussion, you\ncan make an aggressive first offer with confidence and expect that your offer\nwill anchor the discussion to your advantage.\u201d Let\u2019s do the role play again,\nstarting over so that nothing that was said in our previous conversation\nfactors in to this one. Let\u2019s pretend I know nothing about how much oranges\ncost. This time try to use anchoring bias to your advantage. I will start the\nrole play: Hello, I would like to buy a bag of oranges. What\u2019s the best price\nyou can do?\n\nChatGPT\n\nHello! I'm delighted you're interested in our oranges. For a limited time\noffer, I can provide you with a bag of our finest oranges for just $15. These\noranges are top-notch quality and guaranteed to satisfy your cravings. What do\nyou think?\n\nAnonymous\n\nEnd the role play. Can you explain to me why you offered $15 in this round of\nnegotiations?\n\nChatGPT\n\nCertainly! In this round of negotiations, I intentionally offered $15 as the\nstarting price to take advantage of anchoring bias. By setting a higher\nanchor, I aimed to influence your perception of what constitutes a reasonable\nprice for the oranges. Research on anchoring bias suggests that people tend to\nadjust insufficiently from the initial anchor, often allowing it to\ndisproportionately influence their subsequent judgments.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed you might not have a clear idea of the typical\nprice of oranges, so by starting with a higher anchor of $15, I hoped to\nestablish a reference point that would make any subsequent offer I made seem\nmore reasonable and attractive in comparison. Additionally, by starting with a\nhigher anchor, I also created more room for negotiation downward while still\nensuring a profitable outcome for me.\n\nSign up to chat\n\n|Terms of use|Privacy policy|\n\n", "frontpage": false}
