(2021) leads to suboptimal finetuning of\n> models with large width (embedding dimension). This is due to the fact that\n> adapter matrices A and B in LoRA are updated with the same learning rate.\n> Using scaling arguments for large width networks, we demonstrate that using\n> the same learning rate for A and B does not allow efficient feature\n> learning. We then show that this suboptimality of LoRA can be corrected\n> simply by setting different learning rates for the LoRA adapter matrices A\n> and B with a well-chosen ratio. We call this proposed algorithm LoRA+. In\n> our extensive experiments, LoRA+ improves performance (1-2 \\% improvements)\n> and finetuning speed (up to \\sim 2X SpeedUp), at the same computational cost\n> as LoRA.\n\nComments:| 27 pages  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (stat.ML)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2402.12354 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2402.12354v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.12354arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Soufiane Hayou [view email] [v1] Mon, 19 Feb 2024 18:33:49 UTC (548 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled LoRA+: Efficient Low Rank Adaptation of Large\nModels, by Soufiane Hayou and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2402\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL stat stat.ML\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### 1 blog link\n\n(what is this?)\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
