RebornOS\nmakes Arch Linux easy to use and, with the right desktop, an adventure in fun\nand elegance.\n\nAlso: Dynebolic is a portable Linux distribution that can be used without\ninstallation\n\nDid I say \"right desktop?\" I did. Why? During installation, you can choose\nfrom the following desktop environments:\n\n  * Cinnamon\n  * Budgie\n  * GNOME\n  * Xfce\n  * MATE\n  * Deepin\n  * UKUI\n  * LXDE\n  * LXQt\n  * Trinity\n  * Regolith\n  * Cutefish\n  * Enlightenment\n  * Openbox\n  * i3\n\nOf course, not all desktops are created equally and from the above list,\nyou'll find some environments to be more user-friendly and elegant than\nothers. I opted to go with the Deepin desktop environment because it's one of\nthe more aesthetic desktops on the market. I would also put Cutefish on that\nlist, but I've had some issues with Cutefish-based distributions lately. So,\nDeepin it is.\n\nFor those who are curious as to what the hardware requirements are, here's the\nlist of minimum/recommend:\n\n  * CPU - 1.2 GHz dual core/2.1 GHz quad core\n  * RAM - 2 GB/4 GB\n  * Storage - 20 GB/64 GB or more\n\nJudging from the above, you shouldn't have any problem installing RebornOS on\njust about any computer purchased within the last 10 years.\n\nAlso: 5 Linux file and folder management commands you need to know\n\nAs I said, RebornOS is based on Arch Linux but don't let that scare you away.\nAlthough Arch Linux itself can be a bit of a challenge, numerous distributions\naim to simplify it. Some of those distributions succeed, while others seem to\nonly go halfway. RebornOS goes all the way to the finish line with this task\nto create an operating system that anyone could start using and have next to\nno problems.\n\nFrom the desktop, click the main menu to find all of the pre-installed\napplications, a searchable menu, the ability to list items by category or in\nalphabetical order, switch the menu from a pop-up to an overview-style, and\neven a right-click context menu so you can add items to favorites, send them\nto the desktop or the dock, set them to start at login, use a proxy, and even\nuninstall them.\n\nThe Deepin desktop menu makes locating your installed applications and\ncontrolling your machine a breeze.\n\nJack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nThe artists involved configured Deepin desktop to look fantastic out of the\nbox. I was very pleased that they skipped the dark theme (as so many\ndistributions seem to use as the default these days) and added the right\namount of blur/transparency to make it all come together with a decidedly\nmodern flare that isn't over the top.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\nAs I said, you can install the desktop of your choosing but not every option\nfound in RebornOS will be as beautiful as Deepin. The next closest options\nwould be Budgie and Cutefish. Or, if you want something that's very\nstraightforward and simple, go with Cinnamon, or MATE. If you want a desktop\nthat offers more configuration options than you'll ever need, take a look at\neither Xfce or Enlightenment. If modern and minimal are your thing, go with\nGNOME. If you want tiling, there's i3. You get the picture... there's a\ndesktop for everyone.\n\nThe only slight against RebornOS is the list of pre-installed software. You\nwon't find an office suite, an email client, or an image editor. You will find\napps like Calendar, File Manager, Firewall Configuration, MPV Media Player,\nMovie, and more. The good news is that there's the Pamac GUI app installer\nthat makes installing/updating applications a breeze.\n\nAlso: My top 5 user-friendly GUI backup tools for the Linux desktop\n\nI did have a small issue with Pamac after the installation. When I tried to\nrun the app, it refused to sync with the update databases and wouldn't show\nany applications available for installation. Fortunately, I knew how to update\nArch manually (with the command sudo pacman -Syu). After running that command\n(and rebooting), I expected Pamac to behave exactly as expected. It did not.\n\nTurns out, Pamac is fairly broken, so the solution is to install the bauh GUI\nwith the command:\n\nsudo pacman -Sy bauh\n\nOnce you've installed bauh, everything works as expected (except paman, which\nis a lost cause for the moment).\n\nYou can install any software found in numerous Arch repositories from bauh.\n\nJack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nOutside of that one issue, RebornOS is a delight to use. Anyone looking for a\ndesktop distribution that makes Arch Linux easy, offers a desktop environment\nfor all types of users and can be installed and used for free, I would highly\nrecommend giving this take on Linux a try. Just remember to skip pamac and go\nstraight to bauh, otherwise you'll wind up frustrated over an app that should\nmake installing software easy is broken beyond repair.\n\n#### Open Source\n\n5 Linux commands you must know to keep your device running smoothly\n\nThe best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested\n\nThe best Linux distros for beginners\n\nGerman state ditches Microsoft for Linux and LibreOffice\n\nMy 5 favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one)\n\n  * 5 Linux commands you must know to keep your device running smoothly\n\n  * The best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested\n\n  * The best Linux distros for beginners\n\n  * German state ditches Microsoft for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n  * My 5 favorite Linux text editors (and why you should be using one)\n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment Community Guidelines\n\nx\n\nplayer version| 3.2.1  \n---|---  \nplayback state| -1  \ntransition state| start  \n  \n00:00 00:00 Live\n\nLearn More\n\n### Related\n\n### Proton Mail is making a serious case to be my next Linux email client\n\n### Dynebolic is a portable Linux distribution that can be used without\ninstallation\n\n### The best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested\n\nZDNET\n\nwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at\nhome.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Galleries\n  * Videos\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n  * about ZDNET\n  * Meet The Team\n  * Sitemap\n  * Reprint Policy\n\n  * Join\n\n|\n\nLog In\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Site Assistance\n  * Licensing\n\n\u00a9 2024 ZDNET, A Red Ventures company.
