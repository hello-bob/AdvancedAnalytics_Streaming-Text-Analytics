Just when you think you've come to an\nunderstanding, prefixes such as in- will come along and carry meanings such as\n\u201cnot,\u201d \u201cin, within,\u201d \u201cinto,\u201d \u201ctoward,\u201d or \u201cput into or onto.\u201d And to make\nthings worse, some of the beginnings of words which appear to be prefixes\naren\u2019t prefixes at all, even if they seem to function in the same manner.\n\nWhy are we bringing this up? Well, we didn\u2019t want to tell you in this way, but\nwe didn\u2019t want you to hear it from someone else, either. There\u2019s a new sense\nof nonplussed that people have been using, and...well, we\u2019d just like to give\nyou fair warning in case our descriptivist nature causes us to take action.\nThis new sense appears to stem from a mistaken belief that the first three\nletters of nonplus are there to indicate that someone is something other than\n\u201cplussed\u201d (although what being plussed would entail here remains a mystery).\n\nIs he perplexed, or is he unconcerned? We'll never know.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat questionable whether the non in nonplus is actually a prefix at\nall; the word came into English in the 16th century, and was taken from the\nLatin non plus, which means \u201cno more.\u201d When it first appeared in our language\nit was used as a noun, with the meaning of \u201cquandary.\u201d\n\n> This was then, and is now, the answere to that friuolous obiection, and this\n> is the Nonplus that the Libeller vaunteth of. \u2014Thomas Cooper, An Admonition\n> to the People of England, 1589\n>\n> I am brought to a nonplus, O Lorde what shall I saie? \u2014Edward Hutchins,\n> Davids Sling Against Great Goliath, 1593\n>\n> So that now we are much beholding to M. Deacon, and M. Walker, that haue put\n> all fooles and mad men to a perpetuall non plus, whose tongues would\n> otherwise continually bee tampring. \u2014John Darrel, The Replie of Iohn Darrel,\n> 1602\n\nBy the early 17th century nonplus was being used as a verb, with the meaning\nof \u201cto cause to be at a loss as to what to say, think, or do.\u201d Then, as now,\nthe word is often encountered in its participial form (nonplussed), with a\nmeaning that is nearly synonymous with \u201cperplexed.\u201d\n\n> Here may the Non-plust wooer fetch a wile To breake all Remora's, plots to\n> beguile All Fortune's crosses: and if language faile, Here may he learne to\n> court, triumph, bewaile I'th eloquentest straines. \u2014Achilles Tatius, The\n> Loves of Clitophon and Leucippe, 1638\n\nFor the next three hundred and some years nonplus remained on the straight and\nnarrow, avoiding the temptations of demon rum and semantic drift, and as a\nresult of this managed to keep its meaning remarkably unchanged. And then in\nthe early 20th century some people began to use nonplus to mean \u201cunruffled,\nunconcerned,\u201d and ever since then the word just hasn\u2019t been the same.\n\n> I came just in time to see two policemen pushing the car to one side so that\n> the firewagon could get near the plug. Of course anyone knows that under\n> very embarrassing circumstances one is to appear non-plussed, as they say,\n> and smoke a cigarette. \u2014The Pittston Gazette (Pittston, PA), 15 Aug. 1930\n>\n> The onlooker at the right appears nonplussed at the game the posters offer,\n> but then\u2014she\u2019s only a mannequin. \u2014The Mason City Globe-Gazette (Mason City,\n> IA), 16 Apr. 1948\n>\n> Twelve-year-old E. B. \u201cBuzzie\u201d Barker Jr. remained nonplussed yesterday\n> despite the attention and congratulations that he was receiving for having\n> won the Peninsula\u2019s Soap Box Derby Sunday. \u201dI think we are more excited than\n> he is,\u201d his mother, Mrs. Barton Barker, commented. \u201cHe is just about as\n> unconcerned about the whole thing,\u201d she said, but didn\u2019t finish. \u2014Daily\n> Press (Newport News, VA), 28 Jun. 1955\n\nThe \u201cunruffled\u201d sense of nonplussed increased as the 20th century went on,\nalthough when it was noticed this sense has been categorically rejected as a\nmistake. Mistake it may well be, but the fact remains that this sense of the\nword is in widespread use today, and may be found often enough in well\nregarded and highly edited, publications.\n\n> While senior officials in the Israeli Foreign Ministry fume over the\n> diplomatic mess caused by the implications of the Dubai assassinations,\n> those who know Mr Dagan say he is nonplussed by the row. \u2014The Times (London,\n> UK), 18 Feb. 2010\n>\n> There is also the stumbling conversation of the other blind novitiates,but\n> we are all really dependent on the voice of our guide, Romeo Edmead, a\n> vigorous, charming man, completely nonplussed by the tumult we find around\n> us. \u2014Edward Rothstein, The New York Times, 19 Aug. 2011\n\nIf there is a lesson here, it is that you should never trust prefixes (or\nanything that looks like one). It may leave you nonplussed.\n\nShare\n\n#### Word of the Day\n\n#### inviolable\n\nSee Definitions and Examples \u00bb\n\nGet Word of the Day daily email!\n\n## Games & Quizzes\n\nSee All\n\nQuordle Can you solve 4 words at once?\n\nBlossom Word Game You can make only 12 words.
