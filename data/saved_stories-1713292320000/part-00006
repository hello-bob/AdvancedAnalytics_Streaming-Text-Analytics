We are laying the groundwork\nfor these improvements, and you may have seen early work-in-progress in our\ntest builds and in Nightly behind preferences (Firefox Nightly with vertical\ntabs and Firefox is experimenting with a sidebar in Nightly).\n\nWhat to expect next?\n\nIn the near future, we will be landing foundational sidebar features in\nNightly to ensure parity with the existing sidebar and make the new experience\nmore useful and easy to use. Many of the ideas we are exploring are based on\nyour suggestions in Mozilla Connect. You\u2019ve shared how you imagine\nproductivity, switching between contexts, and juggling multiple tasks could\nimprove in Firefox, and we\u2019ve listened.\n\nWe are encouraged by your positive feedback on our early concepts, and we look\nforward to engaging with the community and hearing more about what you think\nonce sidebar features are ready for testing. We will announce feature\nreadiness for feedback in the follow-up blog posts and on Connect.\n\nIn the meantime, if you have questions or general feedback, please engage with\nus on Mozilla Connect.\n\nTags: sidebar\n\n#### Bleeding edge browsing\n\nDownload Firefox Nightly\n\n#### More articles in \u201cFirefox Nightly activities\u201d\n\n  * ##### These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 76\n\nJuly 17, 2020\n\n  * ##### Stylo is ready for community testing on Nightly!\n\nJuly 25, 2017\n\n  * ##### Preview Form Autofill in Firefox Nightly\n\nMay 23, 2017\n\n  * ##### Release Notes for Nightly\n\nApril 24, 2017\n\n  * ##### A Firefox Nightly blog!\n\nJuly 1, 2016\n\n#### Recent articles\n\n  * ##### Customizing Reader Mode \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 158\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n  * ##### Switch to Container Tabs \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 157\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\n  * ##### A Better Screenshots Tool and More \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 156\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\n  * ##### Inspector Performance and Other Improvements \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 155\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\n  * ##### Monitor, Plus More Improvements \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 154\n\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\n### No comments yet\n\nPost a comment\n\n###\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nCancel reply\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Exploring improvements to the Firefox sidebar\n  * Customizing Reader Mode \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 158\n  * Switch to Container Tabs \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 157\n  * A Better Screenshots Tool and More \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 156\n  * Inspector Performance and Other Improvements \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 155\n\n### Recent Comments\n\n  * Allan Wind on Introducing Mozilla\u2019s Firefox Nightly .deb Package for Debian-based Linux Distributions\n  * ZeroDay on Introducing Mozilla\u2019s Firefox Nightly .deb Package for Debian-based Linux Distributions\n  * jonzn4SUSE on A Preview of Tab Previews \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 153\n  * jonzn4SUSE on A Preview of Tab Previews \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 153\n  * jonzn4SUSE on A Preview of Tab Previews \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 153\n\n### Archives\n\n  * April 2024\n  * March 2024\n  * February 2024\n  * January 2024\n  * December 2023\n  * November 2023\n  * October 2023\n  * August 2023\n  * July 2023\n  * June 2023\n  * May 2023\n  * April 2023\n  * March 2023\n  * February 2023\n  * January 2023\n  * December 2022\n  * November 2022\n  * October 2022\n  * September 2022\n  * July 2022\n  * June 2022\n  * May 2022\n  * April 2022\n  * March 2022\n  * February 2022\n  * January 2022\n  * December 2021\n  * November 2021\n  * October 2021\n  * September 2021\n  * August 2021\n  * June 2021\n  * May 2021\n  * April 2021\n  * March 2021\n  * February 2021\n  * January 2021\n  * December 2020\n  * November 2020\n  * October 2020\n  * September 2020\n  * August 2020\n  * July 2020\n  * May 2020\n  * April 2020\n  * March 2020\n  * February 2020\n  * November 2019\n  * October 2019\n  * September 2019\n  * August 2019\n  * July 2019\n  * June 2019\n  * May 2019\n  * April 2019\n  * March 2019\n  * February 2019\n  * January 2019\n  * November 2018\n  * October 2018\n  * September 2018\n  * August 2018\n  * July 2018\n  * June 2018\n  * May 2018\n  * April 2018\n  * March 2018\n  * February 2018\n  * January 2018\n  * December 2017\n  * November 2017\n  * October 2017\n  * September 2017\n  * August 2017\n  * July 2017\n  * June 2017\n  * May 2017\n  * April 2017\n  * March 2017\n  * February 2017\n  * January 2017\n  * December 2016\n  * November 2016\n  * October 2016\n  * September 2016\n  * August 2016\n  * July 2016\n\n", "frontpage": false}
