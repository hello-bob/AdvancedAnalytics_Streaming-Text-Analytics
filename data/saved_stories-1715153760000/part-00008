You can try\nit in your web browser right now.\n\nDecker builds on the legacy of HyperCard and the visual aesthetic of classic\nMacOS. It retains the simplicity and ease of learning that HyperCard provided,\nwhile adding many subtle and overt quality-of-life improvements, like deep\nundo history, support for scroll wheels and touchscreens, more modern keyboard\nnavigation, and bulk editing operations.\n\nAnyone can use Decker to create E-Zines, organize their notes, give\npresentations, build adventure games, or even just doodle some 1-bit pixel\nart. The holistic \"ditherpunk\" aesthetic is cozy, a bit nostalgic, and\nprovides fun and distinctive creative constraints. As a prototyping tool,\nDecker encourages embracing a sketchy, imperfect approach. Finished decks can\nbe saved as standalone .html documents which self-execute in a web browser and\ncan be shared anywhere you can host or embed a web page. Decker also runs\nnatively on MacOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\nFor more complex projects, Decker features a novel scripting language named\nLil which is strongly influenced by both Lua, an imperative language popular\nfor embedding in tools and game engines, and Q, a functional language in the\nAPL family used with time-series databases. Lil is easy to learn and\nconventional enough not to ruffle any feathers for users with prior\nprogramming experience, but also includes pleasant surprises like implicit\nscalar-vector arithmetic and an integrated SQL-like query language. A few\nlines of Lil can go a long way.\n\nDecker provides a small collection of built-in interactive widgets for\nbuilding interfaces, as well as a facility for defining new ones. Custom\nwidgets and their definitions can be copied and pasted using the system\nclipboard, which also makes it possible to share them anywhere you can share\nor store text. Every deck is a toolkit of reusable parts that can be harvested\nand repurposed for another project.\n\nDecker is command-line friendly: when built from source, it comes with Lilt, a\nstandalone Lil interpreter which can (among other things) read, write,\nmanipulate, and even execute Decker documents \"headlessly\". Lilt has even\nfewer dependencies than Decker itself, so it can also be compiled as a cross-\nplatform APE executable, ready for writing run-anywhere shell scripts. Would\nyou believe there's a Lil interpreter that runs on POSIX AWK? Decks are stored\nin a line-oriented text format which interoperates well with existing source\ncontrol tools like Git and SVN.\n\nDecker includes no advertising, telemetry, gamification, or other intrusions\non user privacy and autonomy. If you like Decker, please share it with other\npeople who might enjoy it. Build something that makes you happy.\n\n## Examples\n\n  * Decker: A Guided Tour\n  * 5GUIs\n  * A CHIP-8 Interpreter\n  * All About Draggable\n  * All About Sound\n  * Sokoban: A Block-Pushing Puzzle Game\n\n## Modules\n\n  * Plot: Simple Graphs for Decker\n  * Zazz: Animation Helpers for Decker\n  * Ease: Easing Functions for Decker\n  * Dialogizer: Visual-Novel Modals for Decker\n  * Puppeteer: Visual-Novel Sprite Animation for Decker\n\n## Documentation\n\n  * The Decker reference manual\n  * The Decker document format\n  * The Lil programming language\n  * Learn Lil in 10 Minutes\n  * The Lil playground\n  * Lil Quick-reference card\n  * Lilt: the Lil Terminal\n  * Decker: Responding to Responses\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nBrowsable source code and a bug-tracker are available on GitHub.
