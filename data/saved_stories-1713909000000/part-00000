And you know, I have to\n> say that before this, I expected that Quest would be the better value for\n> most people since it\u2019s really good and it\u2019s like seven times less expensive.\n> But after using it I don\u2019t just think that Quest is the better value \u2014 I\n> think the Quest is the better product, period.\n\nYou can watch the video for Zuckerberg\u2019s full \u2014 and certainly biased! \u2014 take,\nbut the pertinent section for this Article came towards the end:\n\n> The reality is that every generation of computing has an open and a closed\n> model, and yeah, in mobile, Apple\u2019s closed model won. But it\u2019s not always\n> that way. If you go back to the PC era, Microsoft\u2019s open model was the\n> winner, and in this next generation, Meta is going to be the open model, and\n> I really want to make sure that the open model wins out again. The future is\n> not yet written.\n\nJohn Gruber asked on Daring Fireball:\n\n> At the end, he makes the case that each new generation of computing devices\n> has an open alternative and a closed one from Apple. (It\u2019s interesting to\n> think that these rivalries might be best thought of not as closed-vs.-open,\n> but as Apple-vs.-the-rest-of-the-industry.) I\u2019m not quite sure where he\u2019s\n> going with that, though, because I don\u2019t really see how my Quest 3 is any\n> more \u201copen\u201d than my Vision Pro. Are they going to license the OS to other\n> headset makers?\n\nCue Zuckerberg yesterday:\n\n> Some updates on the metaverse today. We are releasing Meta Horizon OS, our\n> operating system that powers Quest virtual and mixed reality headsets, and\n> we are partnering with some of the best hardware companies out there to\n> design new headsets that are optimized for all the different ways that\n> people use this tech.\n>\n> Now, in every era of computing, there are always open and closed models.\n> Apple\u2019s closed model basically went out. Phones are tightly controlled and\n> you\u2019re kind of locked into what they\u2019ll let you do. But it doesn\u2019t have to\n> be that way. In the PC era, the open model won out. You can do a lot more\n> things, install mods. You got more diversity of hardware, software and more.\n> So our goal is to make it so the open model defines the next generation of\n> computing again with the metaverse, glasses and headsets. That\u2019s why we\u2019re\n> releasing our operating systems so that more companies can build different\n> things on it.\n\nIt\u2019s natural to view this announcement as a reaction to the Vision Pro, or\nperhaps to Google\u2019s upcoming AR announcment at Google I/O, which is rumored to\ninclude a new Samsung headset. However, I think that this sells Zuckerberg and\nMeta\u2019s strategic acumen short: this is an obvious next step, of a piece with\nthe company\u2019s recent AI announcements, and a clear missing piece in the\noverall metaverse puzzle.\n\n### Meta\u2019s Market\n\nAny question of strategy starts with understanding your market, so what is\nMeta\u2019s? This is a trickier question than you might think, particularly on the\nInternet. It\u2019s a definition that has particularly vexed regulators, as I laid\nout in Regulators and Reality; after describing why the FTC\u2019s extremely narrow\ndefinition of \u201cpersonal social networking\u201d \u2014 which excluded everything from\nTwitter to Reddit to LinkedIn to TikTok to YouTube as Facebook competitors \u2014\ndidn\u2019t make sense, I explained:\n\n> The far bigger problem, though, is that everything I just wrote is\n> meaningless, because everything listed above is a non-rivalrous digital\n> service with zero marginal costs and zero transactional costs; users can and\n> do use all of them at the same time. Indeed, the fact that all of these\n> services can and do exist for the same users at the same time makes the case\n> that Facebook\u2019s market is in fact phenomenally competitive.\n>\n> What, though, is Facebook competing for? Competition implies rivalry, that\n> is, some asset that can only be consumed by one service to the exclusion of\n> others, and the only rivalrous good in digital services is consumer time and\n> attention. Users only have one set of eyes, and only 24 hours in a day, and\n> every second spent with one service is a second not spent with another\n> (although this isn\u2019t technically true, since you could, say, listen to one\n> while watching another while scrolling a third while responding to\n> notifications from a fourth, fifth, and sixth). Note the percentages in this\n> chart of platform usage:\n>\n> The total is not 100, it is 372, because none of these services exclude\n> usage of any of the others. And while Facebook is obviously doing well in\n> terms of total users, TikTok in particular looms quite large when it comes\n> to time, the only metric that matters:\n>\n> This, of course, is why all of these services, including Instagram,\n> Snapchat, and YouTube are trying to mimic TikTok as quickly as possible,\n> which, last time I checked, is a competitive response, not a monopolistic\n> one. You can even grant the argument that Facebook tried to corner the\n> social media market \u2014 whatever that is \u2014 a decade ago, but you have to also\n> admit that here in 2021 it is clear that they failed. Competition is the\n> surest sign that there was not actually any anticompetitive conduct, and I\n> don\u2019t think it is the FTC\u2019s job to hold Facebook management accountable for\n> failing to achieve their alleged goals.\n\nThis idea that time and attention is the only scarce resource on the Internet,\nand thus the only market that truly matters, is what undergirds Netflix\u2019s\nshift in reporting away from members and towards engagement; the company has\nbeen saying for years that its competitors were not just other streaming\nservices, but everything from YouTube to Twitch streaming to video games to\nsocial media. That has always been true, if you squint, but on the Internet,\nwhere everything is only a click (or app) away, it\u2019s tangible.\n\n### Meta\u2019s Differentiation\n\nDefining the relevant market as time and attention has surprising\nimplications, that even companies raised on the Internet, including Meta,\nsometimes miss. Indeed, there was a time when Meta might have agreed with the\nFTC\u2019s definition, because the company made competitive decisions \u2014 both big\nsuccesses and big mistakes \u2014 predicated on the assumption that your personal\nsocial network was the market that mattered.\n\nStart with an Article I wrote in 2015 entitled Facebook and the Feed:\n\n> Zuckerberg is quite clear about what drives him; he wrote in Facebook\u2019s S-1:\n>\n\n>> Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to\naccomplish a social mission \u2013 to make the world more open and connected.\n\n>\n> I am starting to wonder if these two ideas \u2014 company versus mission \u2014 might\n> not be more in tension now than they have ever been in the past...I suspect\n> that Zuckerberg for one subscribes to the first idea: that people find what\n> others say inherently valuable, and that it is the access to that\n> information that makes Facebook indispensable. Conveniently, this fits with\n> his mission for the company. For my part, though, I\u2019m not so sure. It\u2019s just\n> as possible that Facebook is compelling for the content it surfaces,\n> regardless of who surfaces it. And, if the latter is the case, then\n> Facebook\u2019s engagement moat is less its network effects than it is that for\n> almost a billion users Facebook is their most essential digital habit: their\n> door to the Internet.\n\nA year later and Facebook responded to what was then its most pressing threat,\nSnapchat, by putting Stories into Instagram. I wrote in The Audacity of\nCopying Well:\n\n> For all of Snapchat\u2019s explosive growth, Instagram is still more than double\n> the size, with far more penetration across multiple demographics and\n> international users. Rather than launch a \u201cStories\u201d app without the network\n> that is the most fundamental feature of any app built on sharing, Facebook\n> is leveraging one of their most valuable assets: Instagram\u2019s 500 million\n> users.\n>\n> The results, at least anecdotally, speak for themselves: I\u2019ve seen more\n> Instagram stories in the last 24 hours than I have Snapchat ones. Of course\n> a big part of this is the novelty aspect, which will fade, and I follow a\n> lot more people on Instagram than I do on Snapchat. That last point, though,\n> is, well, the point: I and my friends are not exactly Snapchat\u2019s target\n> demographic today, but for the service to reach its potential we will be\n> eventually. Unless, of course, Instagram Stories ends up being good enough.\n\nIt was good enough \u2014 Instagram arrested Snapchat\u2019s growth, while boosting its\nown engagement and user base \u2014 so score one for Zuckerberg, right? Instagram\nhad a better network, so they won...or did they simply have more preexisting\nusage, which while based on a network, was actually incidental to it?\n\nFast forward a few years and now Facebook\u2019s big competitor was TikTok; I wrote\nin 2020\u2019s The TikTok War:\n\n> All of this explains what makes TikTok such a breakthrough product. First,\n> humans like video. Second, TikTok\u2019s video creation tools were far more\n> accessible and inspiring for non-professional videographers. The crucial\n> missing piece, though, is that TikTok isn\u2019t really a social network...by\n> expanding the library of available video from those made by your network to\n> any video made by anyone on the service, Douyin/TikTok leverages the sheer\n> scale of user-generated content to generate far more compelling content than\n> professionals could ever generate, and relies on its algorithms to ensure\n> that users are only seeing the cream of the crop.\n\nIn a follow-up Update I explained why this was a blindspot for Facebook:\n\n> First, Facebook views itself first-and-foremost as a social network, so it\n> is disinclined to see that as a liability. Second, that view was reinforced\n> by the way in which Facebook took on Snapchat. The point of The Audacity of\n> Copying Well is that Facebook leveraged Instagram\u2019s social network to halt\n> Snapchat\u2019s growth, which only reinforced that the network was Facebook\u2019s\n> greatest asset, making the TikTok blindspot even larger.\n\nI am, in the end, actually making the same point as the previous section:\nMeta\u2019s relevant market is user time and attention; it follows that Meta\u2019s\ndifferentiation is the fact it marshals so much user time and attention, and\nthat said marshaling was achieved via social networking is interesting but not\nnecessarily strategically relevant. Indeed, Instagram in the end simply copied\nTikTok, surfacing content from anywhere on your network, and did so to great\nsuccess.\n\n### Llama 3\n\nThis is the appropriate framework to understand Meta\u2019s AI strategy with its\nLlama family of models: Llama 3 was released last week, and like Llama 2, it\nis open source, or, perhaps more accurately, open weights (with the caveat\nthat hyperscalers need a license to offer Llama as a managed model). I\nexplained why open weights makes sense in a May 2023 Update predicting the\nLlama 2 release:\n\n> Meta isn\u2019t selling its capabilities; rather, it sells a canvas for users to\n> put whatever content they desire, and to consume the content created by\n> other users. It follows, then, that Meta ought to be fairly agnostic about\n> how and where that content is created; by extension, if Meta were to open\n> source its content creation models, the most obvious place where the content\n> of those models would be published is on Meta platforms. To put it another\n> way, Meta\u2019s entire business is predicated on content being a commodity;\n> making creation into a commodity as well simply provides more grist for the\n> mill.\n>\n> What is compelling about this reality, and the reason I latched onto\n> Zuckerberg\u2019s comments in that call, is that Meta is uniquely positioned to\n> overcome all of the limitations of open source, from training to\n> verification to RLHF to data quality, precisely because the company\u2019s\n> business model doesn\u2019t depend on having the best models, but simply on the\n> world having a lot of them.\n\nThe best analogy for Meta\u2019s approach with Llama is what the company did in the\ndata center. Google had revolutionized data center design in the 2000s,\npioneering the use of commodity hardware with software-defined functionality;\nFacebook didn\u2019t have the scale to duplicate Google\u2019s differentiation in 2011,\nso it went in the opposite direction and created the Open Compute Project.\nZuckerberg explained what happened next in an interview with Dwarkesh Patel:\n\n> We don\u2019t tend to open source our product. We don\u2019t take the code for\n> Instagram and make it open source. We take a lot of the low-level\n> infrastructure and we make that open source. Probably the biggest one in our\n> history was our Open Compute Project where we took the designs for all of\n> our servers, network switches, and data centers, and made it open source and\n> it ended up being super helpful. Although a lot of people can design servers\n> the industry now standardized on our design, which meant that the supply\n> chains basically all got built out around our design. So volumes went up, it\n> got cheaper for everyone, and it saved us billions of dollars which was\n> awesome.\n\nZuckerberg then made the analogy I\u2019m referring to:\n\n> So there\u2019s multiple ways where open source could be helpful for us. One is\n> if people figure out how to run the models more cheaply. We\u2019re going to be\n> spending tens, or a hundred billion dollars or more over time on all this\n> stuff. So if we can do that 10% more efficiently, we\u2019re saving billions or\n> tens of billions of dollars. That\u2019s probably worth a lot by itself.\n> Especially if there are other competitive models out there, it\u2019s not like\n> our thing is giving away some kind of crazy advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about having a better model, though: it\u2019s about ensuring that\nMeta doesn\u2019t have a dependency on any one model as well. Zuckerberg continued:\n\n> Here\u2019s one analogy on this. One thing that I think generally sucks about the\n> mobile ecosystem is that you have these two gatekeeper companies, Apple and\n> Google, that can tell you what you\u2019re allowed to build. There\u2019s the economic\n> version of that which is like when we build something and they just take a\n> bunch of your money. But then there\u2019s the qualitative version, which is\n> actually what upsets me more. There\u2019s a bunch of times when we\u2019ve launched\n> or wanted to launch features and Apple\u2019s just like \u201cnope, you\u2019re not\n> launching that.\u201d That sucks, right? So the question is, are we set up for a\n> world like that with AI? You\u2019re going to get a handful of companies that run\n> these closed models that are going to be in control of the APIs and\n> therefore able to tell you what you can build?\n>\n> For us I can say it is worth it to go build a model ourselves to make sure\n> that we\u2019re not in that position. I don\u2019t want any of those other companies\n> telling us what we can build. From an open source perspective, I think a lot\n> of developers don\u2019t want those companies telling them what they can build\n> either. So the question is, what is the ecosystem that gets built out around\n> that? What are interesting new things? How much does that improve our\n> products? I think there are lots of cases where if this ends up being like\n> our databases or caching systems or architecture, we\u2019ll get valuable\n> contributions from the community that will make our stuff better. Our app\n> specific work that we do will then still be so differentiated that it won\u2019t\n> really matter. We\u2019ll be able to do what we do. We\u2019ll benefit and all the\n> systems, ours and the communities\u2019, will be better because it\u2019s open source.\n\nThere is another analogy here, which is Google and Android; Bill Gurley wrote\nthe definitive Android post in 2011 on his blog Above the Crowd:\n\n> Android, as well as Chrome and Chrome OS for that matter, are not \u201cproducts\u201d\n> in the classic business sense. They have no plan to become their own\n> \u201ceconomic castles.\u201d Rather they are very expensive and very aggressive\n> \u201cmoats,\u201d funded by the height and magnitude of Google\u2019s castle. Google\u2019s aim\n> is defensive not offensive. They are not trying to make a profit on Android\n> or Chrome. They want to take any layer that lives between themselves and the\n> consumer and make it free (or even less than free). Because these layers are\n> basically software products with no variable costs, this is a very viable\n> defensive strategy. In essence, they are not just building a moat; Google is\n> also scorching the earth for 250 miles around the outside of the castle to\n> ensure no one can approach it. And best I can tell, they are doing a damn\n> good job of it.\n\nThe positive economic impact of Android (and Chrome) is massive: the company\npays Apple around $20 billion a year for default placement on about 30% of\nworldwide smartphones (and Safari on Apple\u2019s other platforms), which accounts\nfor about 40% of the company\u2019s overall spend on traffic acquisition costs\nacross every other platform and browser. That total would almost certainly be\nmuch higher \u2014 if Google were even allowed to make a deal, which might not be\nthe case if Microsoft controlled the rest of the market \u2014 absent Android and\nChrome.\n\n### Metaverse Motivations\n\nAndroid is also a natural segue to this news about Horizon OS. Meta is, like\nGoogle before it, a horizontal services company funded by advertising, which\nmeans it is incentivized to serve everyone, and to have no one between itself\nand its customers. And so Meta is, like Google before it, spending a huge\namount of money to build a contender for what Zuckerberg believes is a future\nplatform. It\u2019s also fair to note that Meta is spending a lot more than the $40\nbillion Google has put into Android, but I think it\u2019s reasonable: the risk \u2014\nand opportunity \u2014 for Meta in the metaverse is even higher than the risk\nGoogle perceived in smartphones.\n\nBack in 2013, when Facebook was facing the reality that mobile was ending its\ndreams of being a platform in its own right, I wrote Mobile Makes Facebook\nJust an App; That\u2019s Great News:\n\n> First off, mobile apps own the entire (small) screen. You see nothing but\n> the app that you are using at any one particular time. Secondly, mobile apps\n> are just that: apps, not platforms. There is no need for Facebook to\n> \u201creserve space\u201d in their mobile apps for partners or other apps. That\u2019s why\n> my quote above is actually the bull case for Facebook.\n>\n> Specifically, it\u2019s better for an advertising business to not be a platform.\n> There are certain roles and responsibilities a platform must bear with\n> regards to the user experience, and many of these work against effective\n> advertising. That\u2019s why, for example, you don\u2019t see any advertising in\n> Android, despite the fact it\u2019s built by the top advertising company in the\n> world. A Facebook app owns the entire screen, and can use all of that screen\n> for what benefits Facebook, and Facebook alone.\n\nThis optimism was certainly borne out by Facebook\u2019s astronomical growth over\nthe last decade, which has been almost entirely about exploiting this mobile\nadvertising opportunity. It also, at first glance, calls into question the\nwisdom of building Horizon OS, given the platform advertising challenges I\njust detailed.\n\nThe reality, though, is that a headset is fundamentally different than a\nsmartphone: the latter is something you hold in a hand, and which an app can\nmonopolize; the former monopolizes your vision, reducing an app to a window.\nConsider this PR image of the Vision Pro:\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only canvas for apps in the Vision Pro: apps can also take over\nthe entire view and provide an immersive experience, and I can imagine that\nMeta will, when and if the Vision Pro gains meaningful marketshare, build just\nthat; remember, Meta is a horizontal services company, and that means serving\neveryone. Ultimately, though, Zuckerberg sees the chief allure of the\nmetaverse as being about presence, which means the sensation of feeling like\nyou are in the same place as other people enjoying the same experiences and\napps; that, by extension, means owning the layer within which apps live \u2014 it\nmeans owning your entire vision.\n\nJust as importantly \u2014 probably most importantly, to Zuckerberg \u2014 owning the OS\nmeans not being subject to Apple\u2019s dictate on what can or cannot be built, or\ntracked, or monetized. And, as Zuckerberg noted in that interview, Meta isn\u2019t\nparticularly keen to subject itself to Google, either. It might be tempting\nfor Meta\u2019s investors to dismiss these concerns, but ATT should have focused\nminds about just how much this lack of control can cost.\n\nFinally, not all devices will be platforms: Meta\u2019s RayBan sunglasses, for\nexample, could not be \u201cjust an app\u201d; what they could be is that much better of\na product if Apple made public the same sort of private APIs it makes\navailable to its own accessories. Meta isn\u2019t going to fix its smartphone\nchallenges in that regard, but it is more motivation to do their own thing.\n\n### Horizon OS\n\nMotivations, of course, aren\u2019t enough: unlike AI models, where Meta wants a\ncompetitive model, but will achieve its strategic goals as long as a closed\nmodel doesn\u2019t win, the company does actually need to win in the metaverse by\ncontrolling the most devices (assuming, of course, that the metaverse actually\nbecomes a thing).\n\nThe first thing to note is that pursuing an Apple-like fully-integrated model\nwould actually be bad for Meta\u2019s larger goals, which, as a horizontal services\ncompany, is reaching the maximum number of people possible; there is a reason\nthat the iPhone, by far the most dominant integrated product ever, still only\nhas about 30% marketshare worldwide. Indeed, I would pushback on Zuckerberg\u2019s\ncontinued insistence that Apple \u201cwon\u201d mobile: they certainly did as far as\nrevenue and profits go, but the nature of their winning is not the sort of\nwinning that Meta should aspire to; from a horizontal services company\nperspective, Android \u201cwon\u201d because it has the most marketshare.\n\nSecond, the best route to achieving that marketshare is exactly what Meta\nannounced: licensing their operating system to device manufacturers who are\nnot only motivated to sell devices, but also provide the necessary R&D and\ndisparate channels to develop headsets for a far wider array of customers and\nuse cases.\n\nThird, Meta does have the opportunity to actually accomplish what pundits were\nsure would befall the iPhone: monopolize developer time and attention. A big\nreason why pundits were wrong about the iPhone, back when they were sure that\nit was doomed to disruption, was that they misunderstood history. I wrote in\n2013\u2019s The Truth About Windows Versus the Mac:\n\n> You\u2019ve heard the phrase, \u201cNo one ever got fired for buying IBM.\u201d That axiom\n> in fact predates Microsoft or Apple, having originated during IBM\u2019s\n> System/360 heyday. But it had a powerful effect on the PC market. In the\n> late 1970s and very early 1980s, a new breed of personal computers were\n> appearing on the scene, including the Commodore, MITS Altair, Apple II, and\n> more. Some employees were bringing them into the workplace, which major\n> corporations found unacceptable, so IT departments asked IBM for something\n> similar. After all, \u201cNo one ever got fired...\u201d\n>\n> IBM spun up a separate team in Florida to put together something they could\n> sell IT departments. Pressed for time, the Florida team put together a\n> minicomputer using mostly off-the shelf components; IBM\u2019s RISC processors\n> and the OS they had under development were technically superior, but Intel\n> had a CISC processor for sale immediately, and a new company called\n> Microsoft said their OS \u2014 DOS \u2014 could be ready in six months. For the sake\n> of expediency, IBM decided to go with Intel and Microsoft.\n>\n> The rest, as they say, is history. The demand from corporations for IBM PCs\n> was overwhelming, and DOS \u2014 and applications written for it \u2014 became\n> entrenched. By the time the Mac appeared in 1984, the die had long since\n> been cast. Ultimately, it would take Microsoft a decade to approach the\n> Mac\u2019s ease-of-use, but Windows\u2019 DOS underpinnings and associated application\n> library meant the Microsoft position was secure regardless.\n>\n> Evans is correct: the market today for mobile phones is completely different\n> than the old market for PCs. And, so is Apple\u2019s starting position; iOS was\n> the first modern smartphone platform, and has always had the app advantage.\n> Neither was the case in PCs. The Mac didn\u2019t lose to Windows; it failed to\n> challenge an already-entrenched DOS. The lessons that can be drawn are\n> minimal.\n\nThe headset market is the opposite of the smartphone market: Meta has been at\nthis for a while, and has a much larger developer base than Apple does,\nparticularly in terms of games. It\u2019s not overwhelming like Microsoft\u2019s DOS\nadvantage already was, to be sure, and I\u2019m certainly not counting out Apple,\nbut this also isn\u2019t the smartphone era where Apple had a multi-year head\nstart.\n\nTo that end, it\u2019s notable that Meta isn\u2019t just licensing Horizon OS, it is\nalso opening up the allowable app model. From the Oculus Developer blog:\n\n> We\u2019re also significantly changing the way we manage the Meta Horizon Store.\n> We\u2019re shifting our model from two independent surfaces, Store and App Lab,\n> to a single, unified, open storefront. This shift will happen in stages,\n> first by making many App Lab titles available in a dedicated section of the\n> Store, which will expand the opportunity for those titles to reach their\n> audiences. In the future, new titles submitted will go directly to the\n> Store, and App Lab will no longer be a separate distribution channel. All\n> titles will still need to meet basic technical, content, and privacy\n> requirements to publish to the Store. Titles are reviewed at submission and\n> may be re-reviewed as they scale to more people. Like App Lab today, all\n> titles that meet these requirements will be published.\n\nApp Lab apps are a middle ground between side-loading (which Horizon OS\nsupports) and normal app store distribution: developers get the benefit of an\nApp Store (easy install, upgrades, etc.) without having to go through full App\nReview; clear a basic bar and your app will be published. This allows for more\nexperimentation.\n\nWhat it does not allow for is new business models: App Lab apps, if they\nmonetize, still must use Horizon OS\u2019s in-app payment system. To that end, I\nthink that Meta should consider going even further, and offering up a truly\nopen store: granted, this will reduce the long-run monetization potential of\nHorizon OS, but it seems to me like that would be an excellent problem to\nhave, given it would mean there was a long-run to monetize in the first place.\n\n### The Meaning of Open\n\nThis remaining limitation does get at the rather fuzzy meaning of \u201copen\u201d: in\nthe case of Horizon OS, Meta means a licensing model for its OS and more\nfreedom for developers relative to Apple; in the case of Llama Meta means open\nweights and making models into a commodity; in the case of data centers Meta\nmeans open specifications, and in the case of projects like React or PyTorch\nMeta means true open source code.\n\nMeta, in other words, is not taking some sort of philosophical stand: rather,\nthey are clear-eyed about what their market is (time and attention), and their\ncore differentiation (horizontal services that capture more time and attention\nthan anyone); everything that matters in pursuit of that market and\nmaintenance of that differentiation is worth investing in, and if \u201copenness\u201d\nmeans that investment goes further or performs better or handicaps a\ncompetitor, then Meta will be open.\n\n### Share\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n\n### Related\n\nMetaThursday, October 28, 2021\n\nMeta Meets MicrosoftWednesday, October 12, 2022\n\nThe 2023 Stratechery Year in ReviewThursday, December 21, 2023\n\n# By Ben Thompson\n\nAbout Ben Follow via Email/RSS Twitter\n\n# Stratechery Plus\n\nAbout Stratechery Plus Subscribe Member Forum\n\n# Account\n\n  * Member\n\n  * Delivery Preferences\n  * Manage Account\n  * Sign Out\n\n  * Log In\n  * Sign Up\n\nLoading\n\n# Explore Stratechery\n\n  * Concepts\n  * Companies\n  * Topics\n\n# Archives\n\n  * Articles\n  * Updates\n  * Interviews\n  * Years in Review\n\n# Subscriber\u2019s Daily Update\n\nMonday, April 22, 2024\n\n# Netflix Earnings, Netflix\u2019s Reporting Change, Netflix\u2019s Waiting Game\n\nThursday, April 18, 2024\n\n# An Interview with Michael Morton About E-Commerce Winners and Losers\n\nWednesday, April 17, 2024\n\n# More on Humane, Limitless, The iPhone Integration Barrier\n\nMonday, April 15, 2024\n\n# Intel\u2019s Modular Vision, Meta MTIA 2, Google Axion\n\nOn the business, strategy, and impact of technology. \u00a9 Stratechery LLC 2024 | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy\n\n# Search results\n\nFiltersShow filters\n\nSort by:\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\n## No results found\n\n## Filter options\n\nSearch powered by Jetpack\n\n", "frontpage": false}
