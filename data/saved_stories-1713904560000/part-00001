Hopin paid\n$250m for livestreaming platform StreamYard, four times the amount it sold its\nown flagship events product to RingCentral last year, for example.\n\nIt\u2019s Bending Spoon\u2019s third acquisition of 2024. The tech company started the\nyear with the acquisition of US-based events platform Meetup in January, and\nsealed a deal with US media conglomerate IAC later that month to buy Mosaic\nGroup\u2019s suite of mobile apps for over $100m.\n\nIt comes after Bending Spoons boosted its coffers for acquisitions in February\nwith a $155m megaround from some of the world\u2019s biggest growth investors,\nincluding Duolingo backer Durable Capital and Amazon investor Baillie Gifford.\nAt the same time, the company chose to disclose its post-money valuation for\nthe first time \u2014 $2.55bn, crowning it Italy\u2019s third startup unicorn, by order\nof announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### \u201cAn 11-year overnight success\u201d\n\nAll this first quarter news has catapulted the previously under the radar\nItalian firm into the global tech limelight.\n\n\u201cI guess we\u2019re an 11-year overnight success,\u201d CEO Luca Ferrari tells Sifted,\njoking about the company\u2019s recent emergence from relative obscurity to front\nand centre within the European tech hype machine.\n\nAfter Ferrari and his cofounder Matteo Danieli cashed in $40k from their\nprevious failed startup Evertale, they founded Bending Spoons in 2013. They\nquietly bootstrapped the company for almost a decade before raising their\nfirst equity financing round in September 2022 \u2014 $340m from global investors,\nincluding Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds. Up until that point, reinvestment,\nsecondaries and debt kept the wheels turning at the company \u2014 Ferrari says\nthat overall it\u2019s raised more than $500m in debt to date.\n\n### Profitable since day one\n\nBending Spoons CEO and cofounder Luca Ferrari.\n\nUnlike many European tech unicorns, Bending Spoons is currently flush with\ncash. It\u2019s a super rare beast in European startup land in that it\u2019s been\n\u201cprofitable since day one\u201d, CEO Luca Ferrari confirms to Sifted, without\nsharing exact figures.\n\nLater this month, the startup will announce its FY2023 revenues soared 2.5x to\n$392m, up from $162m a year earlier, Sifted can exclusively reveal. The\ncompany is forecasting sales will shoot up further to $500m in 2024.\n\nCovid was a boon for the company. In April 2020, the Italian government chose\nBending Spoons to design and develop the country\u2019s Covid contact tracing app,\nImmuni. This helped accelerate the number of users it now counts across its\napps \u2014 a figure that recently hit 500m, according to the company. When Bending\nSpoons raised its first equity round in 2022, it already had $100m in\nrevenues.\n\n\u201cAs we scale, we unlock certain economies of scale and a lot of the costs\nbecome more efficient because our central functions can serve several products\nrather than needing to be built from scratch,\u201d Ferrari says.\n\n\u201cThis means our margins have improved over time. But 2023 saw accelerated\nrevenue growth for us \u2014 a good chunk of this came from our acquisitions, and a\ngood chunk came from organic growth of our existing products.\u201d\n\n### \u201cIf Berkshire Hathaway and Google had a baby\u201d\n\nUnlike the usual AI and fintech startups that dominate journalist and investor\nattention, Bending Spoons is hard to categorise.\n\nIn the startup\u2019s home city Milan, local press and finance workers enjoy\ndebating whether Bending Spoons can even call itself a tech company. They\nargue the active acquirer is more like a modernised private equity play.\n\nThis debate frustrates Ferrari. \u201cIf the definition of a technology company is\none that invests a large part of its cash flow into research and development,\nthen it\u2019s a resounding yes,\u201d he tells Sifted.\n\nAfter their previous startup Evertale \u201cfailed\u201d on product-market fit, Ferrari\nsays he and his cofounder decided to take a very different approach with\nBending Spoons. Rather than building a product itself, the company acquires\ndigital tech products from other companies that have already proven a fit with\ntheir market, but that Bending Spoons thinks has \u201csubstantial untapped\npotential\u201d, Ferrari explains. They then focus on improving their product and\ntech. Ferrari says this company strategy has remained unchanged for 11 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only sector the company won\u2019t touch is gaming \u2014 and it\u2019s sceptical about\nthe currently \u201cridiculously over-valued assets\u201d in AI, Ferrari says,\npreferring to stick to the company\u2019s applications of AI to enhance the\nproducts it acquires.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to build one of the most significant technology companies in\nthe world through this particular strategy \u2014 which I guess you could say is a\nlittle bit like if Berkshire Hathaway and Google had a baby,\u201d Ferrari tells\nSifted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a hybrid. We have the capital allocation engine and the technology\noperator engine, and as far as I\u2019m aware, that\u2019s unique.\u201d\n\nFerrari says one portfolio product, AI-powered image maker Remini, now has 90m\nmonthly active users.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, it\u2019s the second most-used generative AI product in the\nworld. So if that doesn\u2019t make us a tech company, I don\u2019t know what does,\u201d\nFerrari says.\n\nThree-quarters of Bending Spoons\u2019 employees (300 of 400) are technical hires,\nhe tells Sifted, and he doesn\u2019t remember ever hiring anyone from a traditional\nfinance or private equity background.\n\n### A ruthless approach\n\nBending Spoons employees collaborating.\n\nBending Spoons is known for its ruthless approach when it comes to improving\nthe performance of its acquisitions. Its 2023 Evernote acquisition is a case\nin point. When Bending Spoons acquired the company last year, it boasted $100m\nin recurring revenue and millions of customers \u2014 but it had been unprofitable\nfor years.\n\nBy midway through 2023, Bending Spoons had laid off nearly all of Evernote\u2019s\n250 employees in the US and Chile, and moved the company\u2019s remaining\noperations to Europe \u2014 i.e., in-house to its centralised team.\n\nAt the same time, Bending Spoons also reduced Evernote\u2019s free plan offering to\nencourage users to sign up for paid plans. It hiked annual prices for paid\npersonal and professional plans to $129.99 and $169.99 respectively \u2014 around\ndouble what they\u2019d been since 2016. Although this caused an uproar on customer\nforums, Ferrari is unashamed of the company\u2019s \u201clong-term view\u201d when it makes\ndecisions on new assets.\n\n\u201cYes, a price increase will generally lead to a loss of customers,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBut if you can do it right, it will be a net positive when you also consider\nthat you're retaining some of the more committed customers, which then\ncontribute greater revenues that you can reinvest in the product.\u201d\n\nHe tells Sifted that Evernote is now a profitable, sustainable business.\n\nBut despite this approach to acquisitions, Ferrari says there\u2019s one area that\nBending Spoons hasn\u2019t been aggressive enough \u2014 he regrets taking external\ninvestment so late. \u201cI think we made a mistake as a management team not to tap\ninto that resource earlier,\u201d Ferrari tells Sifted.\n\nThe sky-high valuations given to tech companies in the 2021 bull market meant\nthat \u201cthe opportunity was less pronounced\u201d for Bending Spoons as an acquirer,\nhe says. When valuations began to normalise in 2022 and 2023, the company \u201csaw\na bigger opportunity to press deeper on the accelerator,\u201d he says.\n\n### Italy\u2019s first startup IPO\n\nThanks to its consistent profitability and the global growth investors that\nhave joined its cap table, Bending Spoons is a strong contender for one of\nEurope\u2019s next tech IPOs.\n\n\u201cIt's more likely than not that we will go public in the not-too-distant\nfuture,\u201d Ferrari tells Sifted, adding that the timing will be determined \u201cmore\nby the pipeline of acquisitions than by the market\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re so based on acquisitions, being publicly traded affords certain\nadvantages,\u201d he says.\n\nAn IPO would be a huge moment for Italy\u2019s nascent tech scene, which lags\nbehind that of neighbouring countries France and Germany.\n\nBending Spoons has already had a significant influence on local perceptions of\ntech \u2014 especially when it comes to employment benefits. The salaries it offers\nemployees are more in line with the UK and US than Italy\u2019s standard, and its\ncompany culture is \u201cmore get shit done, more Anglo Saxon than Italian,\u201d one\nearly employee tells Sifted.\n\nNow, local investors tell Sifted that if Bending Spoons were to choose a\ndouble listing in Italy and the US, it would send a much-needed signal to the\ncountry\u2019s corporate world and government that investing in tech is vital for\nItaly\u2019s future economy.\n\nAlthough the company has not yet decided on a location for a potential IPO,\nFerrari has chosen to keep the parent company and head office in Italy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our broader mission to prove that you can build one of the most\nsignificant technology companies in the world with roots in an unlikely place\n\u2014 like Italy,\u201d he says.\n\nFerrari hopes that a Bending Spoons exit success would provide inspiration to\nbudding entrepreneurs in Italy, as well as encouraging existing local\ncompanies to \u201cbe more ambitious\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to build the next Silicon Valley in Italy, but if\nwe could move the needle even slightly, I think there\u2019d be great value in\nthat,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor's pick\n\n  * Interview\n\nZenly's founder is back with amo \u2014 and this time he's not looking for buyers\n\n  * Interview\n\nPirate Bay\u2019s Peter Sunde: \u201cNo one does tech for good \u2014 especially not in\nfintech\u201d\n\n  * Analysis\n\nHow PhotoRoom became France\u2019s hot young GenAI thing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy O'Brien\n\nAmy O'Brien was a reporter at Sifted, covering fintech\n\n# Deeptech# Software & SaaS# Venture Capital\n\nRecommended\n\n  * I\u2019m an ex-founder \u2014 here\u2019s how I\u2019d build my company again with GenAI\n\nGenAI has made building a business from scratch faster and easier than ever \u2014\nbut what if you\u2019ve already built your startup?\n\nSponsored by: AWS\n\n  * How Sweden is failing its spacetechs\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the budget,\u201d says one founder who moved his company to Finland\n\nMimi Billing\n\n  * Inside the AI \u2018revolution\u2019 powering Europe\u2019s autonomous vehicle startups\n\nFully autonomous vehicles are now an \u201cinevitability\u201d \u2014 but can AV startups\ncommercialise their tech?\n\nKai Nicol-Schwarz\n\nBacked by\n\n### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Careers\n  * Advertising\n  * Controllership\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Privacy policy\n  * AI Code of Conduct\n  * Terms of use\n\n### Sifted Pro\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * ~/Briefings\n  * ~/Pitches\n  * ~/Scout\n\n### Products\n\n  * ~/Newsletters\n  * ~/Rankings\n  * ~/Reports\n\n### Community\n\n  * ~/Talks\n  * ~/Podcasts\n  * ~/Summit\n  * Jobs board\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sifted EU Ltd.
