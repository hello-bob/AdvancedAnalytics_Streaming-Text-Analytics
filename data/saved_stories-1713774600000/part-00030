Which brings us to Humane.\n\nHumane raised $230 Million and spent six years to ship an \"Ai Pin,\" with\ndisastrous results.\n\nThe pin shipped with fraction of the features promised at its unveiling eleven\nmonths ago, and what features that did ship fail most of the time. It's too\nheavy, and has atrocious battery life, with users expected to swap batteries\nevery few hours as the device runs uncomfortably hot. Its projector is useless\nin daylight, and its input system is awkward and slow. For a device meant to\nreplace your phone, you expect an experience faster than just whipping out\nyour phone.\n\nIt's safe to say the Ai Pin deserves an exhibit alongside Juicero and Clinkle\nin the museum of Silicon Valley misfires. It stands out from those flops\nbecause, unlike your Clinkles, this isn't the story of a young man given too\nmuch money and power without the maturity to wield it. Humane's founders\nworked on the first iPhone.\n\nI don't have any inside information on what went wrong, but I have theories\nbased on my experiences with venture backed startups and my understanding of\nThe Apple Way of doing things.\n\n### The Venture Capital Mindset\n\nA question that keeps coming up is how Humane raised so much money while\nlaunching nothing. To get there, we need to break down what Venture Capital\nis, and how VC firms think about investments.\n\nRich people and rich organizations (think pension funds and billion dollar\ncollege endowments) don't throw all their money in a savings account or the\nstock market. They have so much money that they can place bets in alternative\ninvestments. These are hedge funds, real estate, or venture capital a.k.a.\n\"throw money at a ton of startups.\"\n\nInvestment returns always correlate with risk. Back in 2018, a savings account\nmight earn you a 1% every year, with zero risk that you'll lose money. The\nstock market might earn you 10%, but carries the risk of a 2007 meltdown. The\nrisk in Venture Capital is downright absurd, with many if not most of your\ninvestments losing money. But every so often you find a smash hit that pays\nback 10,000%.\n\nA respected VC once explained that a third of their investments flop and a\nthird break even, so they need that last one third to be so successful that\nthey both cancel-out the flops and make big returns for investors. That's all\nto say they play the opposite of moneyball: they aren't looking for safe bets,\nbut a few home runs. You only need to pick one Uber-scale success to make up\nfor picking a dozen Juiceros.\n\nWhile a normal person would be insane to put their retirement into startups, a\nVC fund may pool hundreds of millions of dollar\u2014 even upwards of a billion\ndollars\u2014 from people and groups so rich that losing $1m feels like a normal\nperson losing $20 in the washing machine. The fund casts a wide net, and every\nonce in a while they find an AirBnB.\n\nWhile the people who manage these investment firms like to paint themselves as\n\"billionaire scouts\" that possess some keen intuition to pick the winners and\nlosers, in reality there's a handful of checkboxes that any mediocre dude can\nfollow.\n\nOne big signal is whether the startup founder's had prior success. Once you\nsell your first startup, VCs knock down your door to fund your next one.\nWhenever you hear about a stupid startup getting a truckload of funding, it's\nlikely a case of a successful founder's sophomoric follow-up to another\nwinning startup.\n\nWhile Humane's founders never ran their own startup, one of them (Imran\nChaudhri's) did work on the original iPhone. How big a role is up for debate,\nand most Apple people I talk to think that he takes far too much credit for\nother people's work. However, Imran's personal website is titled \"Select\nPatented Works, Volume 1: 1995-2017,\" and links to a thousand patents, his\nname alongside Steve Jobs. While it makes a lot of people I know cringe, it's\nenough to get your startup pitch in front of a VC.\n\nWithin the pitch, VCs look for \"moats.\" These are the features of the company\nthat make it hard for competitors to copy, or otherwise lock your users into\nthe service. Normal people call these \"monopolies,\" but VCs would rather not\nsay the quiet part aloud.\n\nHumane was pitched as replacing the the phone, so look to the iPhone for the\nmoats. Once users trust a service with their most precious photos, they never\nwant to deal with the hassle of switching. Once developers start developing\nfor your platform, it's hard for even the best competitors (WebOS, Windows\nPhone) to catch up with that momentum.\n\nFinally, VCs look at investments through the lens of, \"Why now?\" In 2012 Uber\nshowed that gig work could be the future of employment, so VCs rushed to back\nDoorDash and Instacart and anything else related to gig work. Humane was\nfounded in 2018, a time when everyone realized screens could be toxic. Within\nSilicon Valley, parents made nannies sign contracts agreeing to hide their\nphones from kids. Maybe they imagined phones being stigmatized the same way we\nstigmatize public smoking.\n\nFor all its interesting points, Humane had red flags. Married cofounders are a\nred flag so big you can see it from outer space. I think VCs cut Humane slack\nbecause they were desperate to fund anything during the late 2010's.\n\nWithout making this whole post about financial theory, just understand that\nlow interest rates lead to more startup investments. Following the financial\nmeltdown of 2008, the US saw an unprecedented period of low interest rates,\nand there's even a meme going around where everything insane during the 2010's\ntech bubble is labeled a \"Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon.\"\n\nIn 2018, there was more money flowing into Silicon Valley than there were\nquality startups to invest in. That's OK for VCs because they actually make\nmoney whether or not they pick a winner. They charge \"maintenance fees\" in the\nrange of 1.5% to 2.5%, so when an endowment writes a VC a check for nine\nfigures, the firm makes millions a year. This meant that Humane didn't have to\nbe a knockout, they just had to be the last single person at the bar at\nclosing time.\n\n### Startups Favor Speed\n\nDespite all its quirks, Humane might have worked out if it followed a\ntraditional VC startup formula. Instead, they tried to follow The Apple Way,\nwhere 1.0 products need to be so insanely polished as to blow people away.\n\nThat approach makes sense for Apple. At minimum, they have a reputation to\nkeep up. Sometimes the Apple Way leads to incredible products, like the first\niPhone. Sometimes it doesn't work so well, in the case of the Apple Watch,\nImran's final project at the company.\n\nThe Apple Watch wasn't a flop, but it did struggle a bit out of the gate.\nThat's expected when you try new things. Before you launch, you live in\nvacuum, and you operate on faith that your theories will pan out. After a\nlaunch, you find some of your theories were right (\"Apple Watch is a fitness\ncompanion\"), and some very wrong (\"People will spend $10,000 on a solid gold\ngadget\").\n\nThe Apple Way works best when they take an existing product and make it\namazing. The best pitch for Apple Watch wasn't \"The Rolex of Tech,\" but\nrather, \"A very fancy FitBit.\"\n\nIt also helps when a product leverages Apple's existing ecosystem, and the\ngoodwill Apple had earned from customers. The Apple Watch connected to the\nHealth app, received messages from your phone, played your favorite music,\netc. Apple has a beautiful moat, I'm sure filled with stunning koi fish.\n\nHumane spent five years developing their product in a vacuum. They lacked a\nFitBit to prove their concept. They had little evidence people want to ditch\ntheir phones. They didn't know what form factors users would tolerate. They\ndidn't have normal people telling them battery swaps are dumb.\n\nBut the most damaging consequence of their delayed launch was missing the\nchance to strike while the iron was hot. Humane sounded like a decent idea in\n2018, but that same year the iPhone launched its \"Screen Time,\" which has\nproven a good enough solution for many to curb their screen addiction. In the\nfollowing years we've watched a decline in the use of social media, which\ngives me a \"nature is healing\" vibe. Phone addiction is still a thing, but it\nfeels more like pot than fentanyl.\n\n### The AI Pivot\n\nIt's obvious that Humane pivoted to AI late in the game, and it's obvious how\nthey got backed into that corner. The formula for a VC backed company goes:\n\n  1. Raise a little bit of money\n  2. Build something\n  3. Prove it's taking off\n  4. Go to step 1\n\nThe more you can show a VC that your company is taking off, the more generous\nthe terms of their investment. Being in a position of power means the\ndifference between giving up 5% or 20% of your company for the exact same\nmoney.\n\nThis was a lesson lost through the 2010's as money flowed freely and\nentrepreneurs raised way more than they needed. When interest rates went up in\n2022, startups suddenly found it harder to raise money. Investors were\nsuddenly interested in\u2014 GASP\u2014 profitability.\n\nAt this point Humane had raised $130m, which sounds like a lot of money, but\nthey were also growing their headcount to hundreds of employees. This is\ninsane when you haven't validated your product. Knowing typical tech salaries,\nI'll guess they were burning $30m per year in salaries alone. On top for this,\nI'm sure they'd want to sell their product at a loss, the same way that Sony\nand Microsoft sell game consoles to grow their user base. Gotta build that\nmoat.\n\nHumane was in a precarious position for raising more money. Normally,\ninvestors expect startups to find an \"exit\" (IPO or get acquired) somewhere\nbetween five and eight years from its inception. That's when investors get\ntheir money back with profit. According to VC schedule, Humane should already\nhave a product on the market with a growing user base, and at least showing a\npath to profitability.\n\nTo make matters worse, Humane needed an investor to write a big check. One\nreason you only ask for less money in your early years is that early-stage\ninvestors are comfortable losing a few million here and there. The late-stage\ninvestors that write nine figure checks look for safer bets, and they can get\nby with mere 5\u00d7 returns.\n\nSo Humane needed to ship something to look like a later stage company, but as\nwe now know, their hardware sucked. They decided to latch on to AI, which was\nin the midst of a huge hype cycle. They shifted messaging away from the\nprojector, and in May 2023, Imran delivered a Ted Talk with an obviously\nrigged demo that focused on AI.\n\nI tweeted my theory about an AI pivot in November 2023, and it found its way\nto the official Humane fan Discord. (Yes, Humane setup a fan Discord before\nannouncing any sort of product. They also ran a podcast dedicated to how\nawesome they were.)\n\nBethany replied:\n\nNow when someone says \"you're wrong\" without telling you how you're wrong,\nyou're probably more right than wrong. Bethany tries to hand wave things away\nby mentioning \"the pitch and vision,\" but... come on.\n\nI'm sure their 2018 pitch was about a post-iPhone device. I'm sure it\nmentioned a Siri-like assistant. There was zero chance that it involved\nChatGPT in 2018, because ChatGPT launched in 2022.\n\nIf it's true they always envisioned an AI-first experience, and they spent six\nyears of their lives only to ship this, well, that's way more embarrassing\nthan a last-minute AI pivot.\n\n### The Power of Failing Fast\n\nThe problems with Humane began at their seed stage. They should have tested\nthe idea faster, and rejected it right away. I get that hardware is different\nthan software, and there's no way Humane could have shipped their projector in\na matter of months, or years, but it should have been obvious from early\nprototypes that this product had a minuscule chance of working in the real\nworld. We've already seen the concept debunked.\n\nYet I tried to withhold judgement after that Ted Talk. I thought, \"Maybe they\nfound a solution to projecting in daylight without getting really hot and\negregiously depleting the battery.\" They didn't. They patched over it. Short\nbattery life? Battery swaps! Doesn't work in daylight? Uh... don't use it in\ndaylight!\n\nFor all we know, maybe they did build prototypes but convinced themselves it\nwould be solved. These are certain types of problems you can solve at the\nscale of Apple, but intractable as a startup. Scaling a startup is about\ndeferring those moonshot bets until your company has the momentum to compete\nat that scale.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with pitching one idea to investors and\ngoing in a totally different direction. There's a saying that early-stage\ninvestors back the team, not the idea. Twitter started as a podcast platform,\nand pivoted to social media after getting sherlocked by Apple. Slack started\nas\u2014 I kid you not\u2014 an MMORPG.\n\nHumane could have kept true to the essence of their product, detaching from\nour phones, while not having to fight an unwinnable battle. What about an\ne-ink phone? Imagine a device that gives you weeks of battery life, but too\nlow-fi to leave you vulnerable to addictive apps. Maybe that idea sucks, but\nI'd try a hundred others before going all in on the doomed laser projector\n\nPerhaps we can blame the early commitment on raising too much money, too\nearly. I wish more entrepreneurs knew that you don't need to raise money right\naway. The co-founders must have walked away from Apple with enough money to\ndiddle on silly concepts for a few years without pressure from investors. The\nmoment they accepted their first check, the clock was ticking. They had eight\nyears to build the next Apple.\n\nIt's that funding that will be Humane's undoing. Before the Ai Pin launch,\nthey convinced investors the company is worth $850 million. When they go back\nfor their next round, they need to argue with a straight face that the company\nis now worth $1.7 Billion. Good luck with that.\n\nIt's very likely that the next time Humane raises money, they'll have to value\nthe company less than what they told their last group of investors. These\n\"Down Rounds\" screw recent investors and employees, as the stock that they\nbought is worth less than what they paid for it. It also has a chilling effect\non longtime employees. Do not be surprised by an exodus.\n\n### The Hubris\n\nI don't write essays about startups failing because it feels like punching\ndown. I wouldn't want anyone doing it to me. In fact, my own apps have been\nplagiarized more than a few times, and I'll usually bite my tongue rather than\ntrash talk the developers. It's just tacky and a waste of energy.\n\nIf I had to give one bit of PR advice to a startup, it's to be humble. I\nlearned this from Twitter's early early years, when users somehow tolerated\nweekly service outages. I think users forgave Twitter for all its mistakes\nbecause Ev Williams is a good guy who cultivated a humble culture. Nobody\npublicly trash talked Facebook. Even flops like Google Buzz were relegated to\na few chuckles on internal mailing lists. I didn't know anyone at the company\ndriven by destroying the other guys.\n\nHumane's follies were amplified by overconfidence, as if they thought they\nwere still working at Apple. When Apple launches a thing, they tell you it's\nthe best thing in the world. More often than not, they're right. People are\nattracted to confidence, so I get why it works in Apple's favor, but if you\ncome for the king you best not miss.\n\nIf you aren't 100% confident your product will work (which is to say, every\nstartup), hype and overconfidence are self sabotage. People forgive of\nunderdog startup that swings and misses, but when an overconfident dude trash\ntalks the competition and falls flat on his face, everyone laughs.\n\nEarlier that year Humane released a trailer that vaguely teased something like\na projector system. (Weird choice for an AI centric product?) The trailer felt\nlike a battle cry in the same vein as Apple's 1984 commercial. Don't get me\nwrong, Apple's commercial was awesome, but maybe it was that hubris that Steve\nJobs got fired from Apple a year later?\n\nWhen Steve Jobs returned, he pushed a culture where Apple pre-announces\nnothing. Maybe he knew that if you let your customer's imagination run wild,\nyou have no hope of meeting their expectations.\n\nOnly hubris can explain Humane's dumbest product decision: a mandatory $24/mo\nsubscription that uses a separate phone number. Set aside the money, nobody\nwants to manage two numbers! I have two email addresses and regret it whenever\nI fill out a form.\n\nI can picture the Humane product meeting in my head. \"When we released the\niPhone, we didn't design it as an accessory for your current phone. It had to\nbe so amazing that users will be ready to go all-in. We cannot compromise Ai\nPin by making it an accessory. We must burn the ships.\"\n\nThe flaw in this reasoning is that everything before the iPhone sucked. People\nwere happy to switch to a smartphone, aside from $600 price tag which was hard\nto swallow.\n\nToday we are so reliant on smart phones that abandoning them would upend our\nlives. My brokerage account uses a bespoke authentication app, so without my\nphone and that very specific app, I can't access that money. That would be\nsolved if my brokerage firm ported their authenticator to the Ai Pin, but that\nwill never, ever happen.\n\nIt's a credit to the ridiculous momentum of the first iPhone that Apple\nconvinced so many developers to learn a completely new set of skills, and\nthose developers have now spent 16 years in this ecosystem. Why waste time and\nenergy learning a new platform when it doesn't look like there's going to be a\nmarket for their apps?\n\nA better strategy for AI Pin 1.0 would have been to release it as an accessory\nthat pairs with your iPhone. Drop the cell connection to improve battery life\nand bring down costs. If users bring their own carrier, there's fewer\ncomplaints about dropped connections.\n\nWhile we're cutting features, drop the camera. How many people want to take\nphotos that they can't frame ahead of time? Save money on parts, and use that\nspace to fit more battery. Lower costs opens things up to more users, which\nentice third-party developers to get into the ground floor of the next big\nthing.\n\nInstead, Humane tried to cosplay as Apple, adopting its \"My way or the\nhighway\" attitude without any of Apple's leverage that makes it work.\n\n### The Danger of Nostalgia\n\nKen Kocienda is a microcosm of Humane's obsession with the past. Ken worked on\nthe original iPhone virtual keyboard, and has reminded everyone within earshot\nfor the last two decades. Since leaving Apple, he decided to make \"Apple is\nover\" his personal brand with all the angst of a dude who got dumped and\ninsists, \"I dumped her!\"\n\nAfter tweeting so many strong opinions on design, engineering, and product,\nKen launched the first product of his own in 2020, Upspell. It failed to catch\nthe world on fire, and the following year he was hired by Humane to lead\nproduct engineering.\n\nI'm not here to make fun of UpSpell. It's a perfectly fine game. But Ken made\na very big deal about how he wrote it with Objective-C, and it's so much\nbetter than Swift. He published a video about it, which boils down to, \"I\nalready know Objective-C and Swift is too complicated.\" He presents a false\ndichotomy where you can either work on Swift or focus on building great user\nexperiences.\n\nKen's opinions fly in the face of most iPhone developers who rejoiced in the\nmove to Swift. Sure, it requires learning new things, but Swift rewards you\nwith fewer bugs and greater productivity. I spent eight years writing\nObjective-C before moving to Swift, and I've never regretted the switch. I now\nbuild features in hours instead of days, and that gives me more time to\ndeliver great user experiences.\n\nThere's an irony in Ken's video. He argues that apps are about great\nexperiences and not technology, but instead of making a video about how\nawesome UpSpell is, he made a promotional video about technology.\n\nThe Humane projection system looks really cool, but the experience sucks. The\nAI experience sounds cool on paper, but the results suck. For all of Humane's\ntalk about freeing users from technology, they shipped technology in search of\na purpose.\n\nI blame the team's nostalgia. They clearly want to recreate the Apple from\n2007, but that's impossible under venture capital constraints and without the\nmomentum of Apple. Contrary to what Imran, Ken, and I'm sure many others at\nHumane believe, the iPhone didn't begin with their work in the 2000's on\nProject Purple. It began in 1976 with the Apple computer, and the decades of\ngoodwill it built up in consumers. The project was spearheaded by a guy ready\nto waste billions in iPod revenue if it helped achieve his vision, and he\nanswered to nobody. It came together at the perfect point in time, when\neveryone knew the power of the Internet, but there wasn't a way to carry the\nwhole experience in your pocket. You can't replicate all these factors in a\nfew years, no matter how much money a VC throws at you.\n\nI love Apple's products, and that's why I build my own products outside the\nventure capital system. I also advise and invest in companies that are\ncompatible with venture capital, because it can actually work out fine if\nyou're prepared for the faustian deal. For my own projects, I'm happy building\npolished products that will never be worth billions of dollars. But what would\nI do if I wanted to build the next iPhone?\n\nImran left Apple in 2017, and his departure email suggested that Apple's best\ndays were behind it. Seven years later, it launched the Vision Pro, a\ngargantuan effort on par with the original iPhone. We still don't know where\nit will go, but the launch itself makes it clear Apple is still full of\npassionate, brilliant people ready to tackle the next big thing.\n\nIf there's a tragic lesson to learn from Humane, it's that if you spend all of\nyour time dwelling on the past, you'll miss your chance to shape the future\nsitting right there in front of you.\n\n### Subscribe to Sandofsky\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the latest issues.
