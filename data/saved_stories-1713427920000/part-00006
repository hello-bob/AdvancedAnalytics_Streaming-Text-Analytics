When it comes to getting better grades, it\u2019s\ngood to be the Andersons\n\nPublished On:\n\n    April 16, 2024\nContact:\n\n    \n\n  * Jeff Karoub\n\nSocial Media:\n\n    Share on: Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn\n\n### University of Michigan researchers find lower grades given to students\nwith surnames that come later in alphabetical order\n\nStudy: 30 Million Canvas Grading Records Reveal Widespread Sequential Bias and\nSystem-Induced Surname Initial Disparity\n\nKnowing your ABCs is essential to academic success, but having a last name\nstarting with A, B or C might also help make the grade.\n\nAn analysis by University of Michigan researchers of more than 30 million\ngrading records from U-M finds students with alphabetically lower-ranked names\nreceive lower grades. This is due to sequential grading biases and the default\norder of students\u2019 submissions in Canvas\u2014the most widely used online learning\nmanagement system\u2014which is based on alphabetical rank of their surnames.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they find, those alphabetically disadvantaged students receive\ncomments that are notably more negative and less polite, and exhibit lower\ngrading quality measured by post-grade complaints from students.\n\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time thinking about how to make the grading fair and\naccurate but even for me it was really surprising,\u201d said Jun Li, associate\nprofessor of technology and operations at U-M\u2019s Ross School of Business who\nco-authored the study with doctoral students Jiaxin Pei from U-M\u2019s School of\nInformation and Helen (Zhihan) Wang from Ross.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t occur to us until we looked at the data and realized that sequence\nmakes a difference.\u201d\n\nThe researchers collected available historical data of all programs, students\nand assignments on Canvas from the fall 2014 semester to the summer 2022\nsemester. They supplemented the Canvas data with university registrar data,\nwhich contains detailed information about students\u2019 backgrounds, demographics\nand learning trajectories at the university.\n\nAlthough the data is from U-M, the researchers say the findings can be\ngeneralized across institutions and courses. They are driven by a common\ndesign issue of learning management systems\u2014the default setting of ranking\nstudents\u2019 assignments alphabetically by their names.\n\nTheir research uncovered a clear pattern of a decline in grading quality as\ngraders evaluate more assignments. According to Wang, students whose surnames\nstart with A, B, C, D or E received a 0.3-point higher grade out of 100\npossible points than compared to when they were graded randomly. Likewise,\nstudents with later-in-the-alphabet surnames received a 0.3-point lower\ngrade\u2014creating a 0.6-point gap.\n\nWang notes for a small group of graders (about 5%) that grade from Z to A, the\ngrade gap flips as expected: A-E students are worse off, while W-Z students\nreceive higher grades relative to what they would receive when graded\nrandomly. Such observations confirm their hypothesis that it\u2019s the order of\ngrading that leads to the initial gap in grades.\n\nA 0.6-point difference might seem small, but such a disparity did affect\nstudents\u2019 course grade-point averages, which negatively influences\nopportunities in their respective career paths.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion is this may be something that happened unconsciously by the\ngraders that\u2019s actually creating a real social impact,\u201d Wang said.\n\nPei says the idea for the study came up during a discussion he had with Wang\nin which they were talking about their research: She studies educational\ntechnology and he studies artificial intelligence. He observed that a\nfundamental task of machine learning is data labeling, also a sequential task\nthat can be long and tedious\u2014but one that is randomized.\n\nIt got them thinking about educational systems like Canvas and led to some\npilot studies to see if there was any disparity among grades based on the\namount of time spent in the task of grading.\n\n\u201cWe kind of suspect that fatigue is one of the major factors that is driving\nthis effect, because when you\u2019re working on something for a long period of\ntime, you get tired and then you start to lose your attention and your\ncognitive abilities are dropping,\u201d Pei said.\n\nThe researchers note the option exists to grade the assignments in a random\norder, and some educators do, but alphabetical order is the default mode in\nCanvas and other online learning management systems. One simple fix would be\nto make random order the default setting.\n\nThey also suggest academic institutions could hire more graders for larger\nclasses, distribute the workload among more people or train them to be aware\nof and lessen the bias while grading.\n\nLi, Wang and Pei have been sharing their research at conferences and it\u2019s been\npositively received\u2014many are impressed by their work though it confirms\nsuspicions many harbor. One reaction in particular stands out to Li\u2014no doubt\nan information-age wrinkle on \u201cthe dog ate my homework\u201d excuse.\n\n\u201cA college student emailed us afterward asking us to share the paper with\nhim,\u201d she said. \u201cHe mentioned that his last name started with W. He\u2019s going to\ntell his parents it\u2019s not because of him\u2014it\u2019s because of his last name.\u201d\n\nThe study is under review by the journal Management Science.\n\n412 Maynard St. Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1399 Emailumichnews@umich.edu\nPhone734-764-7260 About Michigan News\n\n##### More News\n\n  * Arts\n  * Athletics\n  * Engaged Michigan\n  * Global Michigan\n  * Michigan Medicine\n  * Public Affairs\n\n##### Publications\n\n  * Michigan Today\n  * The University Record\n\nOffice of the Vice President for Communications \u00a9 2024 The Regents of the\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nBy clicking \u201cAccept All\u201d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device\nto enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing\nefforts.
