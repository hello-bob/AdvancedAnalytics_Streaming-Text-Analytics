While\ndesign systems commonly prioritize UI design components and patterns,\nincorporating content standards is equally important for producing high-\nquality, consistent content. This article outlines what your design system\nshould include to effectively integrate content standards.\n\n## In This Article:\n\nWhat Are Content Standards?\n\n  * What Are Content Standards?\n  * Supporting Content and Design Collaboration\n  * Steps for Setting and Integrating Content Standards\n  * What to Include in Content Standards\n  * Benefits of Content Standards in Design Systems\n  * Adoption, Adherence, and Maintenance\n\n## What Are Content Standards?\n\n> Content standards are the guidelines and best practices for scalable content\n> design and management. They include rules for structuring the content, as\n> well as editorial procedures and policies.\n\nStructuring content into adaptable content blocks facilitates the efficient\nreuse of elements across various content types and channels. Editorial\nguidelines help to maintain a coherent content process and consistent voice,\ntone, and writing style.\n\nIntuit\u2019s content standards were so comprehensive that they lived on a separate\nsite. The site included sections for its various brands, foundational context\nabout content and content strategy, content-testing, and more.\n\n## Supporting Content and Design Collaboration\n\nUnlike UI components in a design system, content standards aren\u2019t followed\nthrough mere duplication. Content designers aren\u2019t just reusing the exact\nphrases or the same formulaic sentence structure.\n\nInstead, content standards ensure that every piece of content, though unique,\nfeels part of a cohesive whole and aligns with the company\u2019s overarching brand\nidentity and user experience.\n\nContent standards also help bridge the common collaboration gap between visual\nand content designers. By using the interface patterns and components outlined\nin the design system, instead of filling these with meaningless lorem ipsum\ntext in early design, UI and content design can happen in parallel.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Spectrum design system included a dedicated, global section for\nContent and a design checklist for each UI pattern. The checklist had specific\nwriting guidelines for the text associated with that element.Adobe\u2019s Spectrum\ndesign system also included specific writing standards alongside UI\ncomponents, such as how help and error text should be displayed for password\nfields. This way, UI and content design can happen together.\n\n## Steps for Setting and Integrating Content Standards\n\n### 1\\. Scope and Prioritize\n\nYou can create content standards even if you don\u2019t have a design system;\nthey\u2019ll be ready for integration once it\u2019s established. Begin with a\nmanageable scope for what content standards to create; you don\u2019t have to make\nthem all at once. Prioritize standards for areas critical to your\norganization\u2019s goals or that qualitative research identified as problematic.\n\n### 2\\. Collaborate and Advocate\n\nWork collaboratively with the designers and developers who own and manage the\ncompany\u2019s design system. Address any concerns about adding content standards\nby emphasizing their benefits: consistency and time savings in content design.\n\n### 3\\. Familiarize Yourself with Tools\n\nDetermine what tools and processes currently support your organization\u2019s\ndesign system. If adding content standards risks overwhelming the product\ndevelopment team, consider establishing a separate but related content system\nor style guide.\n\nDraw inspiration from organizations with impressive content standards, such\nas:\n\n  * Intuit\n  * Mailchimp\n  * Australian Government\n\nMake sure you give these systems due credit.\n\n### 4\\. Set Structure and Specifications\n\nDetermine a structure for your content standards. Some guidelines will be\nglobal, and others will be specific to components, patterns, channels, content\ntypes, or user groups.\n\n### 5\\. Audit and Inventory\n\nAudit current content to identify inconsistencies and areas for improvement.\nLooking at what already exists will inform the development of new standards or\nthe refinement of existing ones. Save examples of what to do and avoid.\n\n## What to Include in Content Standards\n\nContent standards typically include two types of standards.\n\nContent-strategy and process standards| Content-creation and design standards  \n---|---  \n  \n  * Content goals and principles (some teams express these through a content-strategy statement)\n  * Content team members, roles, and responsibilities\n  * Step-by-step workflows, including reviews and approvals\n  * Content-operations details like using manuals, AI tools, content-management systems, and Figma plugins for content\n  * Publishing, SEO, maintenance, and removal procedures\n\n|\n\n  * Criteria for selecting content formats and format-specific considerations\n  * Inclusivity and accessibility standards\n  * Readability statistics and grade levels\n  * Global best practices for writing for the we\n  * Organizational standards and editorial guidelines related to style, tone, style, tone, voice, grammar, and more\n\n  \nMailchimp\u2019s content style guide included goals and principles for writing.\nThese are akin to the visual-design principles describing aesthetic purpose\nand values that are often included in a visual-design system.\n\n### Global and Unique Standards\n\nContent strategists can outline global standards that apply to all content,\nregardless of where the content appears in the user\u2019s experience. They can\nalso set specific standards for various content types (e.g., social media,\nproduct content, help content) or design-system patterns (e.g., buttons and\nlinks in a banner).\n\nThe advantage of setting global standards is that there\u2019s no need to repeat\nthose for every communication channel or UI component \u2014 only what differs or\nvaries needs outlining.\n\nFor example, Sainsbury\u2019s design system includes design foundations, component\nguidelines, and an entire section dedicated to content standards. Some\nstandards, labeled as Content foundations, apply globally to all content,\nwhile other sections focus on writing or content design for specific parts of\nthe experience or components. The design system also covers process elements\nand tools to accelerate content design while maintaining quality and\nconsistency.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s design system included globally relevant content standards and\ndirection for specific content types and experience elements.\n\n### Who Can Contribute to Content Standards\n\nContent strategists, UX writers, and content designers should be able to ask\nquestions about content standards and provide input on their applicability and\npracticality. It\u2019s also important to get the perspective of UI designers and\nengineers to ensure consistency, adaptability, and technical feasibility.\n\nAnytime the standards are updated, communicate the changes to product teams\nusing the design system and content standards. Ideally, outline the changes or\nupdates in the design system itself.\n\nAtlassian\u2019s design system included an entire section for content standards and\na dedicated area where designers and developers could find contextual self-\nservice help or contact the design-system team.\n\n## Benefits of Content Standards in Design Systems\n\n### Efficiency in Decision Making\n\nUX writers and content designers often face pressure to develop content\nquickly or are brought into design processes too late to work effectively.\nContent designers and writers are also usually disproportionally represented\non product teams compared to their design and development peers.\n\nWhile content standards can't fully solve these process and organizational\nissues, they can help teams speed up decision making during content-design\nwork. They can also help evangelize practices that promote a unified and\ncollaborative approach to design and content strategy.\n\nComponent examples should use accurate content that represents what content\ndesigners should and shouldn\u2019t do. These can empower UI designers to include a\nhigh-level first pass at messaging goals or actual copy, thus lightening the\nworkloads of busy content designers.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s Lightning design system: Content sections included concrete\nexamples of what writers should and shouldn\u2019t do when writing chatbot\nmessaging. Such examples speed up product-development decision making.\n\n### Disambiguating Content Strategy and Execution\n\nStandards are a crucial component of any content strategy. They bridge the gap\nbetween strategic planning and consistent, efficient execution. Incorporating\ncontent-strategy guidelines into the design system can demystify this often-\nambiguous topic, ensuring clarity and coherence.\n\nIntuit provided contextually relevant resources to educate team members about\ncontent strategy.\n\n### Providing a Single Source of Truth\n\nWhen they exist, content standards are frequently found in isolated documents\nor PDFs. While some standards are better than none, embedding these standards\nwithin component design systems can significantly improve collaboration\nbetween UI and content designers.\n\nA single, accessible reference for all design-related tasks accelerates the\ndesign process and promotes high-quality content. In contrast, relying on\nscattered resources like separate PDFs, can make applying standards more\ncumbersome and inefficient in real-world design work.\n\nShopify\u2019s Polaris design system included both design and content standards in\none place.\n\n### Enabling the Use of AI-Based Content Tools\n\nEstablishing content standards is also essential before you can leverage AI-\nbased tools to automate, scale, and expedite the content-design process. Many\nAI-based tools allow you to set your standards directly within them to ensure\nthat the guidelines are readily available to team members working in platforms\nlike Figma, Word, Google Docs, or your CMS.\n\nOptum\u2019s content standards included a section on how to use the AI content\nplatform Writer.ai in practice. Because Optum has such a large content team,\nall tools used by its writers and content designers should be powered by\nconsistent standards.\n\nContent standards in design systems can also guide how designers and UX\nwriters should \u2014 or shouldn't \u2014 use AI tools in their projects to ensure a\nbalanced and ethical output.\n\nIntuit outlined strict guidelines for using AI in writing and content to\nensure that designers aren\u2019t just copying and pasting from generative tools.\n\n## Adoption, Adherence, and Maintenance\n\nFor content standards to be widely adopted and used, they should have a clear,\nconcise, and well-organized structure. The goal is to provide straightforward,\nactionable direction that all team members can follow quickly and easily.\nDon\u2019t get tired of talking about the content standards in the design system,\neither. Reference them often, direct people to specific sections, and share\nthem across digital workplace tools.\n\nDBS Bank stored content standards for the intranet right on the intranet\nitself, so publishers could easily adopt them. The standards included\nconsiderations for publishing intranet content and retiring content when it\nexpires.\n\nIf you\u2019re having difficulty getting people to adopt and adhere to the\nstandards, communicate that their purpose isn\u2019t to stifle creativity or\nintroduce unnecessary bottlenecks; it's the opposite!\n\nContent standards aim to alleviate common content pain points and ensure\nconsistency and quality efficiently, from the start. If you have clearly\noutlined standards, with examples, teams won\u2019t have to debate or argue about\ncontent-design decisions or word usage and will move forward faster. Share\nsuccess stories from projects and teams that have effectively implemented\ncontent standards.\n\n### Roles, Responsibilities, and Training\n\nDefine roles and processes for maintaining content standards and regularly\nreview guidelines and components. Many teams review content standards\nannually, with specific components or categories (such as process, workflow,\nand tools) being reviewed more often or as needed.\n\nEnsure that all stakeholders, from designers to content creators, understand\nthe content standards and how to apply them. Regular training sessions and\ncommunication can help with successful implementation.\n\n### Showing the Value of Content Standards\n\nTo tangibly demonstrate the benefits of adding content standards to your\ndesign system, start tracking product and content teams\u2019 time savings as\nconcrete evidence of improvement.\n\nOther measurable indicators that highlight the value of incorporating content\nstandards into the design system include the following metrics.\n\nOrganizational and product metrics (parentheses indicate the desirable\ndirection of change):\n\n  * Product and content-team satisfaction (increased)\n  * Number of projects delayed (decreased)\n  * Number of late-stage content requests (decreased)\n  * Usage of the content standards (increased)\n  * Instances of team members ignoring standards and suggestions (decreased)\n\nUser-focused metrics:\n\n  * User satisfaction (increased)\n  * User engagement (increased)\n  * Error rates (decreased)\n  * Conversion rates (increased)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs organizations grow and evolve, so will their content needs. Design your\ncontent standards to be scalable and flexible, allowing for updates and\nadjustments as needed without sacrificing consistency or quality.\n\nWhile design-system components and patterns provide the skeleton of user\nexperiences, content standards breathe meaning into them. The real art lies\nnot in applying rigid templates but in the skillful adaptation of content\nstandards to communicate effectively with people to deliver what they need.\n\n## Related Courses\n\n  * #### Content Strategy and Governance\n\nTechniques and tools for implementing an actionable content strategy\n\nManagement\n\n  * #### Writing Compelling Digital Copy\n\nUse UX writing to shape your content to meet your readers' needs\n\nInteraction\n\n  * #### Design Systems and Pattern Libraries\n\nIncrease design quality, consistency, and efficiency\n\nManagement\n\nContent Strategy,Writing for the Web,content\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Content Strategy Content Strategy\n  * Writing for the Web\n\n## Learn More:\n\nPlease accept marketing cookies to view the embedded video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZwBxp_wZVI\n\nContent Strategy 101\n\nAnna Kaley \u00b7 3 min\n\n  * How To: Content Inventory and Audit\n\nAnna Kaley \u00b7 3 min\n\n  * Writing Content for Generalists vs. Specialists\n\nKate Moran \u00b7 3 min\n\n  * Content Management Models\n\nAnna Kaley and Maria Rosala \u00b7 3 min\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n  * Content Strategy 101\n\nAnna Kaley \u00b7 6 min\n\n  * Content Inventory and Auditing 101\n\nAnna Kaley \u00b7 8 min\n\n  * Related Content Boosts Pageviews, When Done Right\n\nHoa Loranger \u00b7 6 min\n\n  * User-centric vs. Maker-centric Language: 3 Essential Guidelines\n\nJanelle Estes \u00b7 5 min\n\n  * Long vs. Short Articles as Content Strategy\n\nJakob Nielsen \u00b7 7 min\n\n  * The End of Legacy Media (Newspapers, Magazines, Books, TV Networks)\n\nJakob Nielsen \u00b7 5 min\n\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter\n\nGet weekly UX articles, videos, and upcoming training events straight to your\ninbox.\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Instagram\n  * Youtube\n  * Podcast\n  * Twitter\n\nCertification\n\n  * What is UX Certification?\n  * Specialties\n  * Exams\n  * UX Certified People\n\nUX Training\n\n  * Virtual Training\n  * Browse Courses\n  * Course Calendar\n\nConsulting\n\n  * UX Maturity Assessment\n  * Expert Review\n  * User Testing\n  * Customized Research\n  * Team Training\n  * Applied Workshops\n  * Keynote Speaking\n\nFree Guidance\n\n  * Articles & Videos\n  * The NN/g UX Podcast\n\nAbout\n\n  * Why NN/g\n  * About Us\n  * People\n  * Contact\n  * Return Policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1998-2024 Nielsen Norman Group, All Rights Reserved.\n\n  * Cookie Preferences\n  * Cookie Declaration\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
