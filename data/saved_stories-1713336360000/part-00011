Everyone is buzzing about\nartificial intelligence and how it can change the landscape of many fields of\nendeavor including education, medicine, and software development There is\npushback from folks who are skeptical of the accuracy and the source of the\ndata that has been fed into the large language models that are in the\nbackplane of these systems.\n\n### What is a large language model (LLM)?\n\nBriefly, large language models are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that\nexcels at processing and understanding large amounts of text data. They are\nessentially complex algorithms trained on massive datasets of text and code,\nenabling them to perform various tasks related to natural language processing.\n\nCan we trust the information they are sending back to us from questions that\nwe ask them? These questions are called text prompts. I started experimenting\nwith ChatGPT in December of 2022. Since then, I have used other proprietary\nsystems like Google\u2019s Gemini and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot. These systems remind me\nof the once popular movie, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d where a computer named HAL\ntells his human operator, \u201cDave, that is something I cannot allow to happen.\u201d\n\nNow, we\u2019re at that moment where art and life intersect. We have machines which\nwe talk to with text prompts, and they generate code, complete essays, create\ncontent for books, and even supply images that trigger our imagination. This\nall seems Orwellian, and it has prompted a lot of skepticism and alarm among\nacademics, developers, and the general public, who are concerned that our\nprivacy is being compromised.\n\n### What is Llamafile?\n\nI discovered a large language model that I could download and install on my\nLinux computer to let me explore this exciting new world of LLMs without\ncompromising my privacy. It is called Llamafile, and it\u2019s being developed by\nMozilla, which has long been a respected member of the open source community.\nLlamafile is a single executable file that runs locally on most computers that\nis open source. Llamafile currently has nearly thirty developers led by\nJustine Tunney. It has an Apache 2.0 license. The project aims to make large\nlanguage models more accessible to developers and end users.\n\n### How to use Llamafile\n\nTo use Llamafile, you need to download it to your computer. Be sure to follow\nthe Quickstart Guide highlighted in the project\u2019s Github repository.\n\nOpen your terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the\nexample Llamafile. Make the file executable by changing the permissions.\n\n    \n    \n    $ chmod +x llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile\n\nOnce the file has become executable, you can launch it in the terminal.\n\n    \n    \n    $ ./llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile -ngl 9999\n\nAt this point, your browser should open automatically to\nhttps://127.0.0.1:8080 or https://locahost:8080, and you can interact with the\nLLM in its chat interface.\n\nNow that the Llamafile is active, I can ask it some questions to see if this\nlarge language model can supply me with the correct code to create a square\nusing the \u2018turtle\u2019 module in Python. Here is the result.\n\nHere\u2019s another great example of using a text prompt to generate in this case a\nthank you note to my wife for preparing a wonderful meal. No home should be\nwithout AI.\n\n## About the Author\n\nI am Don Watkins, a free and open source software (FOSS) advocate.\n\nRead Don's Full Bio\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0\nInternational License.\n\n#### Save the Date for All Things Open 2024\n\nJoin thousands of open source friends October 27-29 in downtown Raleigh for\nATO 2024!\n\nSave the Date 2024\n\n#### Upcoming Events\n\nWe do more than just All Things Open and Open Source 101.
