Insert it between your TV\u2019s IR receiver and\nthe flame from a lighter, and pull the slots along to generate the coded\npattern. Get it just right and you have a paper and lighter remote control.\nThat\u2019s just what [ViralVideoLab] did and you can see it in action in the video\nbelow.\n\nThink of this as just the germ of an idea. Imagine how you\u2019d automate this and\nextend it to include more commands. A wheel with the various bitstreams cut\ninto the circumference comes to mind. A servo would turn the wheel to the\ndesired command and something else would fire up the lighter just as the slots\npass by. Now take it a little further. You already have a remote control with\nkeypad and IR light. Hack that to talk to a microcontroller which would\ncontrol the servo and the IR light. And there you go. A useless but fun hack\n(hint hint).\n\nAnd before you do cry useless. Hackers are no stranger to making useless\nmachines as long as it\u2019s a fun hack. Take this world\u2019s biggest useless AI\nmachine for example. Or what about this book scanner with unseeing eyes. Or\nthere\u2019s this endlessly fun to watch classic useless machine that turns itself\noff, but with eight switches.\n\nThanks to [ttl] for sending us the tip about this.\n\nPosted in Misc Hacks, SliderTagged IR remote, remote control, TV remote\n\n## 114 thoughts on \u201cFaking TV Remote Control With Paper And A Lighter\u201d\n\n  1.

But I am quite sure they used a\ndifferent carrier frequency than the widespread (e.g. Philips) RC5 coding, for\nwhich you could get the integrated receivers like TSOPxxx most easily.

RoGeorge says:\n\nFebruary 7, 2017 at 3:38 am\n\nThat\u2019s a nice hack!\n\nIt could definitely work (in some special conditions). I powered a TSOP1730,\nand its output can be triggered by a lighter and some moving paper slots. Not\nvery reliable/repeatable, but it can be triggered without a carrier. Also,\nthere are some other things that may be tricky, like the RC-5 toggle bit and\nso on, but it might work.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  17.

First the lighter could burn\nthe paper sheet, so it should be replaced by an IR led. Then to get a better\nmodulation and a more reliable result, we could replace the paper sheet by a\nsimple electronic modulator (arduino ?) and a push-button to switch it on/off\neasily. Finally put all that inside a small plastic case, and while we\u2019re at\nit, add some other buttons to get some more commands like channel up/dn,\nvolume up/dn and so on. I\u2019m pretty sure this can be done in the near future !\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

I have a decent enough experience playing with IR\nremote emulation and decoding. A modulated receiver cannot do false trigger\nfor the entire message. I agree it can trigger for false signal but not do the\nentire message.\n\nAnother thing is that the message cannot be easily replied by hand movement.\nThe RC5 timing is little bit critical, we cannot simply stretch or compress\nthe message by human error.\n\nSo I believe this is a fake video until or unless some one tries it and proves\nit is correct.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Also, there is no 38 or 40\nKHz carrier. Maybe some old types do not use modulated signal, but new TVs\nsurely need it. So, the only way to switch off TV with lighter and paper is to\nlit a paper and throw it in your TV set. Yes, you will need the fire\nextinguisher also.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  41.
