A day after the\nfarm first started noticing cows were getting sick, the cats started getting\nsick too. By the end, more than half of the cats had died.\n\n\"The cats were found dead with no apparent signs of injury and were from a\nresident population of [approximately] 24 domestic cats that had been fed milk\nfrom sick cows,\" the scientists wrote.\n\nTests of the samples collected from the brains and lungs of dead cats yielded\nresults suggesting \"high amounts of virus.\" Autopsies of the cats also\nrevealed \"microscopic lesions consistent with severe systemic virus\ninfection,\" they said, including to the eye and brain.\n\nAround 1 in 5 samples of milk the Food and Drug Administration checked from\nU.S. retailers tested positive for H5N1, though the agency said last week that\nstudies so far show that pasteurization is working to kill off the virus in\nmilk; only harmless fragments remained. Officials have repeatedly urged\nAmericans not to drink raw milk.\n\nWhile the spread of the virus from cows to cats through raw milk is new, cats\nhave long been known to scientists as one of the species especially vulnerable\nto severe disease from H5N1.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has said that deaths and neurological\ndisease in cats have been \"widely reported\" around farms with outbreaks of the\nvirus.\n\nBy contrast, only a fraction of cows \u2014 up to 15% \u2014developed signs of illness\nin herds with the infection, the scientists said. Officials have said that\ncows largely recover within a month after their infections. The virus has been\ndevastating for poultry flocks that faced widespread deaths or had to be\nculled after contracting the virus from wild birds.\n\nPrevious research has linked deaths and neurological disorders in domestic\ncats to H5N1 infections. An earlier study published by the CDC journal from\nThailand back in 2006 suspected a cat had contracted the virus after eating an\ninfected pigeon.\n\nBut the recent infections prompted the CDC this month to issue new guidance\nfor veterinarians treating suspect H5N1 cases in cats, urging stepped up\nmeasures like donning respirators and goggles to avoid contracting the virus.\n\n\"While it's unlikely that people would become infected with bird flu viruses\nthrough contact with an infected wild, stray, feral, or domestic cat, it is\npossible \u2014 especially if there is prolonged and unprotected exposure to the\nanimal,\" the agency said in its guidance.\n\nSome cases in humans have also been suspected to have been caused by\nconsumption of infected birds, like in Cambodia earlier this year.\n\nDoctor on bird flu: \"So far, no real risk to the human population\" 03:32\n\nMeanwhile, authorities have been racing to curb further spread of the virus in\ndairy cattle, which is believed to have been spreading from cow-to-cow since a\nsingle initial spillover from wild birds earlier this year.\n\n\"Ingestion of feed contaminated with feces from wild birds infected with HPAI\nvirus is presumed to be the most likely initial source of infection in the\ndairy farms,\" the scientists wrote.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday it would test ground beef sold\nat retailers for H5N1 and would study how cooking beef could curb potential\nrisk posed by the virus, in the wake of an earlier order ramping up testing on\ndairy cattle being shipped over state lines.\n\nIt is unclear whether any ground beef samples have so far tested positive for\nthe virus. Results \"are forthcoming\" and will be shared when available, the\nspokesperson said.\n\nMeanwhile, over 2,000 tests have been run by the department so far this month\nfrom cattle.\n\n\"As of April 30, 34 dairy herds have been impacted by H5N1. For context, there\nare more than 26,000 dairy herds nationwide,\" the spokesperson said in a\nstatement.\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nBird flu in raw milk?
