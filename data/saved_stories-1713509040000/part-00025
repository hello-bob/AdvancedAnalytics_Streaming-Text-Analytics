Beneath the headline, Grok went into even more detail to support its\nfake reporting:\n\n> In a bizarre turn of events, NBA star Klay Thompson has been accused of\n> vandalizing multiple houses with bricks in Sacramento. Authorities are\n> investigating the claims after several individuals reported their houses\n> being damaged, with windows shattered by bricks. Klay Thompson has not yet\n> issued a statement regarding the accusations. The incidents have left the\n> community shaken, but no injuries were reported. The motive behind the\n> alleged vandalism remains unclear.\n\nGrok appears to be confusing a common basketball term, where players are said\nto be throwing \"bricks\" when they take an airball shot that doesn't hit the\nrim. According to SF Gate, which was one of the first outlets to report the\nGrok error, Thompson had an \"all-time rough shooting\" night, hitting none of\nhis shots on what was his emotional last game with the Golden State Warriors\nbefore becoming an unrestricted free agent.\n\nIn small type under Grok's report, X includes a disclaimer saying, \"Grok is an\nearly feature and can make mistakes. Verify its outputs.\"\n\nBut instead of verifying Grok's outputs, it appeared that X users\u2014in the\nservice's famously joke-y spirit\u2014decided to fuel Grok's misinformation. Under\nthe post, X users, some NBA fans, commented with fake victim reports, using\nthe same joke format to seemingly convince Grok that \"several individuals\nreported their houses being damaged.\" Some of these joking comments were\nviewed by millions.\n\nX did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment or confirm if the\npost will be corrected or taken down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past, both Microsoft and chatbot maker OpenAI have faced defamation\nlawsuits over similar fabrications in which ChatGPT falsely accused a\npolitician and a radio host of completely made-up criminal histories.\nMicrosoft was also sued by an aerospace professor who Bing Chat falsely\nlabeled a terrorist.\n\nExperts told Ars that it remains unclear if disclaimers like X's will spare\ncompanies from liability should more people decide to sue over fake AI\noutputs. Defamation claims might depend on proving that platforms \"knowingly\"\npublish false statements, which disclaimers suggest they do. Last July, the\nFederal Trade Commission launched an investigation into OpenAI, demanding that\nthe company address the FTC's fears of \"false, misleading, or disparaging\" AI\noutputs.\n\nBecause the FTC doesn't comment on its investigations, it's impossible to know\nif its probe will impact how OpenAI conducts business.\n\nFor people suing AI companies, the urgency of protecting against false outputs\nseems obvious. Last year, the radio host suing OpenAI, Mark Walters, accused\nthe company of \"sticking its head in the sand\" and \"recklessly disregarding\nwhether the statements were false under circumstances when they knew that\nChatGPT\u2019s hallucinations were pervasive and severe.\"\n\nX just released Grok to all premium users this month, TechCrunch reported,\nright around the time that X began giving away premium access to the\nplatform's top users. During that wider rollout, X touted Grok's new ability\nto summarize all trending news and topics, perhaps stoking interest in this\nfeature and peaking Grok usage just before Grok spat out the potentially\ndefamatory post about the NBA star.\n\nThompson has not issued any statements on Grok's fake reporting.\n\nGrok's false post about Thompson may be the first widely publicized example of\npotential defamation from Grok, but it wasn't the first time that Grok\npromoted fake news in response to X users joking around on the platform.\nDuring the solar eclipse, a Grok-generated headline read, \"Sun\u2019s Odd Behavior:\nExperts Baffled,\" Gizmodo reported.\n\nWhile it's amusing to some X users to manipulate Grok, the pattern suggests\nthat Grok may also be vulnerable to being manipulated by bad actors into\nsummarizing and spreading more serious misinformation or propaganda. That's\napparently already happening, too. In early April, Grok made up a headline\nabout Iran attacking Israel with heavy missiles, Mashable reported.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n33\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
