Created by Ben Barrett-Forrest\n\u00a9 Forrest Media - 2013 http://www.benbf.ca Information Sources: Thinking in\nType by Ellen Lupton Just My Type by Simon Garfield If this video sparks any\nideas, I would love to hear about them! Script: Type is power. The power to\nexpress words and ideas visually. It\u2019s timeless, but always changing, and\nthat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to explore. Most people agree that the creator of\ntypography was a German man named Johannes Gutenberg. (And yes he wore a hat\nlike that). Before Gutenberg came along and revolutionized the world of\ncommunication, books needed to be scribed by hand, usually by monks, which was\nvery time-consuming and expensive. So Gutenberg created Blackletter, the first\never typeface, modeled after the writing of the scribes. Blackletter has thick\nvertical lines and thin horizontal connectors which made it great for scribing\nbut it looked very dense and squished together when printed. Things needed to\nchange. Enter Roman Type. Now this typeface is Cambria, which you're probably\nused to seeing on your word processor, but the first ever Roman typeface was\ncreated in the 15th century by Nicolas Jenson. Jenson worked mainly in Venice,\nItaly, and was inspired by the lettering found on Ancient Roman Buildings. His\nletterforms were based on straight lines and regular curves, which made it\nmuch more legible compared to the dense darkenss of Blackletter. This typeface\nwas an instant success and quickly spread across Europe, riding on the coat\ntails of the renaissance. The next major innovation in typography after roman\nletters was italics, which are like slanted and stylized versions of roman\ntype. They were created in the late 15th century by Aldus Manutius from Italy\nas a way of fitting more letters onto the page and saving money. Now we use\nitalics interspersed in roman type for emphasis. Aldus Manutius also created\nthe modern comma and semicolon, but that\u2019s another story. Type development\nstayed fairly stagnant until the 18th century in England, when William Caslon\ncreated a typeface that set a new standard for legibility. While it wasn\u2019t\nanything radical, it was just what the world was looking for. The style of\nCaslon\u2019s typeface is now referred to as Old Style. A few decades later,\nanother Brit named John Baskerville created a new variety of typeface, which\nwe call Transitional. Later still a Frenchman named Didot, and an Italian\nNamed Bodoni created typefaces that we have classified as modern. Most serif\ntypefaces fit into one of these three categories, but what does each one mean?\nAn old style typeface has letters that have thick serifs, and low contrast\nbetween thick and thin strokes. A transitional typeface has letters with\nthinner serifs and a higher contrast between thick and thin strokes. And a\nmodern typeface has letters with very thin serifs and an extreme contrast\nbetween thick and thin strokes . Next, William Caslon\u2019s great Grandson, named\nWilliam Caslon IV, got sick of all of these serifs, so he decided to remove\nthem entirely and made a new kind of typeface called a sans-serif. It didn't\ncatch on immediately, but would eventually get really big. During the second\nindustrial revolution, advertising created a need for new typefaces. Letters\nwere made taller, and wider, mainly used in large sizes on posters and\nbillboards. Things got pretty weird, but one happy result of all this\nexperimentation is Egyptian, or slab serif. It has really thick serifs and is\nusually used for titles. As a backlash to the complexity found in typefaces of\nthe 19th century, the early 20th century brought something simple. Paul Renner\nfrom Germany created a typeface called Futura and it was based on simple\ngeometric shapes. This is called a geometric sans. Around the same time a\nBritish man named Eric Gill created a typeface called Gill Sans that was\nsimilar to a geometric sans but with gentler, more natural curves, and this is\ncalled a Humanist sans. The next major step in the world of sans serifs\nhappened in Switzerland in 1957 with the introduction of Helvetica. It has\nsimple curves and is available in many different weights, and some would call\nit the world\u2019s favourite typeface. The world of typography changed forever\nwith the introduction of the computer. There were a difficult few years of\ncrude pixel type due to the primitive screen technology. But then technology\nevolved and computers began to allow for the creation of thousands of\nbeautiful typefaces. And the odd, ahem, dud. But now anyone has the freedom to\ncreate their own unique typeface. And that is the history of typography.\n\nShow less Show more\n\n##\n\nKey moments\n\n#### TYPE is POWER\n\n#### TYPE is POWER\n\n0:15\n\n#### TYPE is POWER\n\n0:15\n\n#### ROMAN TYPE\n\n#### ROMAN TYPE\n\n1:05\n\n#### ROMAN TYPE\n\n1:05\n\n#### Jenson\n\n#### Jenson\n\n1:13\n\n#### Jenson\n\n1:13\n\n#### Caslon\n\n#### Caslon\n\n2:08\n\n#### Caslon\n\n2:08\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### Ben Barrett-Forrest\n\n5.59K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\n## Comments 1.1K\n\nTop comments\n\nNewest first\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# The History of Typography - Animated Short\n\nBen Barrett-Forrest\n\nBen Barrett-Forrest\n\n5.59K subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n1.8M views 11 years ago\n\n1,884,675 views \u2022 Apr 28, 2013\n\nShow less\n\nA paper-letter animation about the history of fonts and typography. 291 Paper\nLetters. 2,454 Photographs. ......more\n\n...more\n\n##\n\nKey moments\n\n#### TYPE is POWER\n\n#### TYPE is POWER\n\n0:15\n\n#### TYPE is POWER\n\n0:15\n\n#### ROMAN TYPE\n\n#### ROMAN TYPE\n\n1:05\n\n#### ROMAN TYPE\n\n1:05\n\n#### Jenson\n\n#### Jenson\n\n1:13\n\n#### Jenson\n\n1:13\n\n#### Caslon\n\n#### Caslon\n\n2:08\n\n#### Caslon\n\n2:08\n\n#### Baskerville Transitional\n\n#### Baskerville Transitional\n\n2:24\n\n#### Baskerville Transitional\n\n2:24\n\n#### Sans Serif\n\n#### Sans Serif\n\n3:12\n\n#### Sans Serif\n\n3:12\n\n#### EGYPTIAN\n\n#### EGYPTIAN\n\n3:33\n\n#### EGYPTIAN\n\n3:33\n\n#### GEOMETRIC SANS\n\n#### GEOMETRIC SANS\n\n3:55\n\n#### GEOMETRIC SANS\n\n3:55\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### Ben Barrett-Forrest\n\n5.59K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow less\n\n# The History of Typography - Animated Short\n\n1,884,675 views1.8M views\n\nApr 28, 2013\n\nDownload\n\n### History of Typography - Domestika\n\nDomestika\n\nDomestika\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n46K views 3 years ago\n\n### Why this font is everywhere\n\nVox\n\nVox\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n2.3M views 3 years ago\n\n8 videos Now playing\n\n### Graphic Design Course Unit 03 | Making Business Stationery\n\nCanva \u00b7 Playlist\n\nCanva \u00b7 Playlist\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n### The Story of Coffee | History of Coffee | Motionlab\n\nMotionlab\n\nMotionlab\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n90K views 3 years ago\n\n### Beginning Graphic Design: Color\n\nLearnFree\n\nLearnFree\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n6.1M views 7 years ago\n\n### Bad typography has ruined more than just the Oscars\n\nVox\n\nVox\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n3.8M views 7 years ago\n\n### A Defense of Comic Sans\n\nVsauce\n\nVsauce\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n9.6M views 11 years ago\n\n### The 8-bit arcade font, deconstructed\n\nVox\n\nVox\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n689K views 4 years ago\n\n### Matthew Carter: My life in typefaces\n\nTED\n\nTED\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n175K views 10 years ago\n\n### Abstract: The Art of Design | Paula Scher: Graphic Design | FULL EPISODE | Netflix\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n2.5M views 4 years ago\n\n### I promise this story about fonts is interesting\n\nstruthless\n\nstruthless\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n1.5M views 1 year ago\n\n### Beginning Graphic Design: Typography\n\nLearnFree\n\nLearnFree\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n4.2M views 7 years ago\n\n### An Intro to Typography\n\nKaren Kavett DIY\n\nKaren Kavett DIY\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n292K views 13 years ago\n\n### What is Killing Helvetica?\n\nEnvato\n\nEnvato\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n111K views 5 years ago\n\n### The Font That Makes Everyone Read Faster - Cheddar Explains\n\nCheddar\n\nCheddar\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n466K views 4 years ago\n\n### 10 Timeless Typography Tips\n\nFlux Academy\n\nFlux Academy\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n49K views 2 years ago\n\n### Beginning Graphic Design: Layout & Composition\n\nLearnFree\n\nLearnFree\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n3.4M views 7 years ago\n\n### The Best Fonts, According to Science\n\nSciShow\n\nSciShow\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n203K views 2 months ago\n\nSaving your choice\n\nAn error occurred while saving your choice.
