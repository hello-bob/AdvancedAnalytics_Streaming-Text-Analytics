Originally from California, he spent twenty-three\nyears in Paris, at the Institute for the Research and Coordination of\nAcoustics and Music and the French National Centre for Scientific Research.\nBut in 2004, McAdams returned to McGill University in Montreal, where he\u2019d\ndone an undergraduate degree in experimental psychology\u2014and where his first\nexperiment was on the perception of timbre. He is perhaps the world\u2019s leading\nexpert on the subject\n\n\u201cAs it starts to swell,\u201d continued McAdams, \u201cWagner is adding in clarinets,\nEnglish horn, and, at the peak, he adds in the oboes so he\u2019s making it all\nvery much brighter. Then as it goes down, all these instruments fall out.\u201d\nBecause he has the instruments play the same pitches, Wagner creates a\npowerful effect by changing the timbre. \u201cSo he\u2019s enhanced the pitch contour\nwith a timbral contour. Actually, I am just getting goosebumps just thinking\nabout it\u201d\u2014he paused briefly to laugh deeply\u2014\u201cbecause he does it so\nbeautifully.\u201d\n\nMcAdams\u2019 interest in timbre separates him from most other researchers in his\nfield. Timbre\u2019s role in music has always been underrated, or even ignored,\nprobably because it is an intangible that\u2019s difficult to describe, hard to\ncategorize, and so far, immune to measurement. Pitch, by contrast, is simple\nto explain, fits neatly into systems such as the pentatonic scale, and can be\neasily measured in hertz. It\u2019s also overtly mathematical. \u201cTimbre has all\nkinds of dimensions, and it\u2019s much more fluid and more difficult to\nconceptualize unless you tie it specifically to instruments,\u201d said McAdams.\n\u201cBut even a given instrument has got this whole universe of timbre that it can\noccupy.\u201d An instrument\u2019s timbre can vary depending on other attributes such as\npitch or dynamics. A clarinet, for example, has a round, luscious sound in the\nlow registers, but it gets much more piercing in the high registers.\n\nEven the definition of timbre is a matter of debate. Google it and you\u2019ll see\nthat most sources describe timbre as the tone colour of an instrument. But\nthat ignores many other attributes such as attack quality, which is how the\nstart of the first note sounds as it moves from silent to full volume. Should\nyou ever get to meet McAdams at a cocktail party and happen to ask what timbre\nis, he\u2019d say: The thing that distinguishes different musical instruments. His\nmore formal definition: Everything that distinguishes two sounds that are the\nsame in pitch and loudness and spatial position and duration. Though, as he\nadded, \u201cthat leaves a whole bunch of stuff.\u201d\n\n*\n\nI also asked Paul Swoger-Ruston to explain timbre to me. A former guitarist in\nKing Apparatus, a respected Canadian third-wave ska band, he has a Ph.D. in\ntheory and composition and teaches at Ryerson University in Toronto. Swoger-\nRuston is convinced timbre is a lot more important than people realize. In\nfact, he believes it\u2019s probably what we\u2019re most sensitive to when we listen to\nmusic. He offered two definitions for timbre. The first: those elements of a\nsound that distinguish it from another. The second: the waste bucket for\neverything we can\u2019t describe in music.\n\nUnsatisfied, I asked my friend (and fellow Hazlitt contributor) Chantal\nBraganza, who is married to a jazz musician. She said that if music had a\nsmell, that would be its timbre. This idea appealed to me, but I wondered if\nan even better way to put it might be to think of timbre as music\u2019s terroir.\n\nIn wine, terroir is the characteristic flavour shaped by where the grapes\ngrew, including the soil, the geography, the topography, and the climate. In\nmusic, different instruments have different timbres the same way that two\ngrapes have distinct tastes. But more than that, two guitars made by different\nluthiers have their own individual timbres, and two musicians playing the same\nguitar will have different timbres.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s most blatant in the identity war that is high school, but music never\nstops being a badge of recognition.\"\n\nMcAdams laughed when I suggested that timbre was music\u2019s terroir. But he\ndidn\u2019t call it a completely stupid notion. In fact, he pointed out that there\nwere a lot of similarities between the way we describe the taste and smell of\nwine and the way we describe the timbre of an instrument. Without a clear\nlexicon, we have to borrow vocabulary from elsewhere when we talk about these\nthings. Oenophiles may describe a wine by comparing it to flavours such as\ncherry, coffee, or chocolate and sometimes to something we wouldn\u2019t want to\ndrink such as leather or charcoal. With timbre, the descriptors tend to be\nabstract and often borrowed from the tactile (warm, cold, rough) or visual\n(bright, dark) senses. The absence of a strict coding system means that some\ncharacterizations are noteworthy for their inventive evocativeness: one of\nMcAdams\u2019s research subjects described a sound as being like someone slapping a\nsteak on a corrugated tin roof.\n\nThe lack of respect for timbre is especially surprising given that we hear it\nall the time. \u201cWhat is speech?\u201d McAdams said. \u201cSpeech is timbre.\u201d The unique\ntimbre of my voice\u2014the attack characteristics, my consonance, the colour of my\nsound and how it all changes over time\u2014is based on both nature (the physiology\nof my head, nose, mouth, and throat) and nurture (where I carry tension in\nvocal production, habits of speech, and dialect). My friends recognize me\nimmediately on the telephone or, because I have a notoriously loud voice,\nbefore they even see me in a roomful of people. It\u2019s my terroir.\n\n*\n\nNaturally, after hearing McAdams talk about Parsifal, which I was not familiar\nwith, I had to hear it for myself. I found it on YouTube and, even on my first\nlisten and despite being far from an expert in opera, I immediately understood\nwhy the piece moved him so much. Goosebumps are a physiological response to\nmusic for some people, though rarely one I\u2019ve experienced. But I could feel\nthe tension build and then fall away. I felt shivers in my spine.\n\nThe power of timbre is something we are (or should be) reminded of when we go\nto the movies. \u201cWhy do they use these low contrabasses and bassoons,\u201d McAdams\nsaid, dropping his voice low, \u201cin the theme for Jaws or those high, screechy\nviolin sounds\u201d\u2014here he made high-pitched squeaks\u2014\u201cin Psycho. All that\u2019s\ntimbral.\u201d\n\nAnother way to think about timbre is by comparing instruments. In an old\nstand-up bit, Steve Martin strummed the banjo and mused, \u201cYou just can\u2019t sing\na depressing song when you\u2019re playing the banjo . . . You can\u2019t just go, \u2018Oh,\ndeath, and grief, and sorrow, and murder.\u2019 . . . When you\u2019re playing the\nbanjo, everything\u2019s okay . . . I always thought the banjo was the one thing\nthat could have saved Nixon.\u201d And in \u201cYou Just Can\u2019t Play a Sad Song on a\nBanjo,\u201d Willie Nelson sang that violins are sweet and steel guitars are\nthrilling, but nothing beats banjos for fun.\n\n\u201cThe twentieth century was really about explorations in timbre.\u201d\n\nBanjos have bright timbres and the plucked strings have a short sustain, which\nencourages musicians to play them fast, according to Ohio State University\u2019s\nDavid Huron. You aren\u2019t likely to hear sad songs played on piccolos either,\nbecause of their high pitch and bright sound. Musicians seeking the melancholy\nmight want to try a cello. Because of its low range and sustained pitches, it\ncan be played slowly and quietly. Huron\u2019s study found that part of the reason\nwe may consider some instruments sad is that they have some of the same\ntimbre\u2014quieter, slower, more \u201cmumble-like\u201d articulation, darker\u2014that convey\nsadness in speech.\n\nSome instruments generate different emotions depending on how they\u2019re played.\nBrass instruments deliver a much brighter, brassier sound when played loud\nthan when played softly. \u201cOne of the powerful things about a brass crescendo,\u201d\nsaid McAdams, \u201cis it\u2019s not just getting louder, it\u2019s also getting much\nbrighter at the same time. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s a really effective emotional\ndevice in orchestral music.\u201d\n\n*\n\nI checked a textbook to see what it had to say about timbre. Not much.\nAccording to the index in Understanding Music, the word appears on two pages\nand is defined as a synonym for tone colour, which appears on a few more\npages. But timbre has deep roots in Western classical music. During the Middle\nAges and Renaissance, composers didn\u2019t specify what instruments should play\nthe music. It was all about pitch, and it didn\u2019t really matter what\ninstruments the musicians used\u2014they just performed with what they had. But\nstarting in the Baroque period, some composers, notably Bach and Vivaldi,\nbegan to specify the instrumentation as they sought certain sounds and\nexperimented with different combinations of them. Timbre, in other words.\nVivaldi\u2019s The Four Seasons, for example, used specific string instruments to\nconvey the sounds of the seasons and nature.\n\nThis playing around with the possibilities came at a time when instrument\nmakers were doing some of their own inventing, giving the composers more\noptions. Later, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven worked with orchestration, and in\nthe latter half of the nineteenth century the size of orchestras grew and\ncomposers became increasingly concerned with what they could get out of each\ninstrument. Meanwhile, the artisans who made instruments kept refining their\nproducts to elicit new and different sounds. At the turn of the twentieth\ncentury, Claude Debussy famously worked with timbre. Many people called his\ncompositions Impressionism because they seemed to be the aural equivalent of\nwhat the Impressionist painters were doing (though, predictably, he hated the\nterm). After that came Edgard Var\u00e8se and his \u201corganized sound,\u201d Arnold\nSchoenberg and serialism, minimalism, and the French spectral school.\nAccording to Swoger-Ruston, \u201cThe twentieth century was really about\nexplorations in timbre.\u201d\n\nAs venues changed, so did music. In the Middle Ages, musicians often performed\nin Gothic cathedrals and other stone-walled places as part of religious\nfunctions. \u201cThe reverberation time in those spaces is very long\u2014more than four\nseconds in most cases\u2014so a note sung a few seconds ago hangs in the air and\nbecomes part of the present sonic landscape,\u201d writes David Byrne in How Music\nWorks. \u201cA composition with shifting musical keys would inevitably invite\ndissonance as notes overlapped and clashed\u2014a real sonic pileup.\u201d Several\ndistinct timbres would have created their own sonic smash-up. So Gregorian\nchant, which was monophonic\u2014a single melodic line with no harmony or\ncountermelody\u2014also required the singers to match timbres. Music became more\ncomplex as it moved to concert halls, opera houses, and palace ballrooms.\nLarger orchestras may have been a result of the need to resonate more in\nballrooms full of dancers. And as music became louder, it allowed for more\nvariety in timbres.\n\nIf classical composers explored timbre, popular music, which is often played\nin even less controlled environments, became all about timbre. The high\nnasally voice that we hear in early country and early blues is probably a\nfunction of playing in noisy juke joints without microphones. \u201cThose tones\nreally cut through the audience,\u201d said Swoger-Ruston. \u201cSo shaping your voice\nfor projection ends up creating a timbral quality to that music.\u201d Similarly,\nas rock stars began playing large venues such as hockey arenas, the subtleties\nof harmony, if there were any, became lost. Byrne says the sound in CBGB, the\nlegendary New York City club where he both listened to and played music, was\nremarkably good. \u201cThe amount of crap scattered everywhere, the furniture, the\nbar, the crooked uneven walls and looming ceiling made for both great sound\nabsorption and uneven sound reflections\u2014qualities one might spend a fortune to\nrecreate in a recording studio.\u201d And with no reverberation, the audience could\nhear every detail of the music, as long as it was played loud enough to\noverwhelm the unruly crowd. Think about that the next time you listen to\n\u201cPsycho Killer,\u201d the first Talking Heads hit.\n\nTimbre is even more crucial in contemporary genres such as electronic dance\nmusic and rap. EDM, said Swoger-Ruston, is really \u201cexperimentation with\ntimbre.\u201d The widespread use of sampling means the sample, not the note, is\nincreasingly the basic unit of music.\n\nEver since nineteenth-century Romanticism, we\u2019ve had this idea that the\nmusician is supposed to be an individual. Guitarists create their own unique\nsound depending, among other things, on where they\u2019re plucking the strings and\nat what angle. And they are increasingly playing with effects boxes and other\ngadgets. One of McAdams\u2019s favourite guitarists, The Edge, is forever changing\nthe timbre of his sound with such technology. \u201cThat\u2019s a whole timbral universe\nthat he\u2019s trying to use that increases the emotional impact of what he\u2019s\ndoing,\u201d said McAdams. \u201cSo he\u2019s controlling pitch, he\u2019s also controlling timbre\na little bit with the way he plucks, but he\u2019s controlling timbre a lot with\nall of his effects boxes and things like that.\u201d\n\nNothing is as distinctive as the human voice, so it\u2019s no surprise that vocal\ntimbres would become so pivotal in popular genres. Folk music, for example, is\nreally about the individuality of the voice, often accompanied by guitar\nplaying that is little more than functional and supportive. \u201cCertainly just\nhaving a stripped down texture of guitar and voice is a unique timbral\ncondition,\u201d said Swoger-Ruston. He also believes that 1960s rock is built on\nintense layers of texture and timbre almost to the point of saturation. But\nonce again, the vocal timbre is crucial. There aren\u2019t too many big singers\nfrom that genre that we can\u2019t identify quickly from their voice, he said,\nadding that a lot of that music relies on similar tools\u2014the same chords and\nharmonies\u2014and only small differences in melodies. So timbre is the easiest way\nto create something unique. \u201cIt\u2019s these voices with real character to them and\nmaybe you hear the real person behind them.\u201d\n\nA vocal timbre can also reveal economic and cultural background. Some singers,\nespecially in the early periods of commercial popular music, were encouraged\nto either accentuate their timbre\u2014including accent, diction, ornamentation,\nand register\u2014or to abandon what occurred naturally for them, in the interest\nof appealing to a wider or different audience. In the late \u201950s and early\n\u201960s, Patsy Cline weakened her accent and strengthened her vibrato to appeal\nto new listeners as the Nashville Sound gained fans.\n\nThe relationship between timbre and class is also a factor in the splintering\nof musical culture that began in the \u201950s and accelerated in the following\ndecades. \u201cMusical subcultures exist because our guts tell us certain kinds of\nmusic are for certain kinds of people,\u201d writes Carl Wilson in Let\u2019s Talk about\nLove: A Journey to the End of Taste. \u201cIt\u2019s most blatant in the identity war\nthat is high school, but music never stops being a badge of recognition. And\nin the offhand rhetoric of dismissal\u2014\u2018teenybopper pap,\u2019 \u2018only hippies like\nthat band,\u2019 \u2018sounds like music for date rapists\u2019\u2014we bar the doors of the clubs\nwe don\u2019t want to claim us as members.\u201d\n\n*\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: since most of the genres we fight over are built on the\nstructures, harmonies, and basic forms of early popular music, the only way to\ndistinguish, say, country rock from honky-tonk, or psychedelic rock from heavy\nmetal, is by timbre. This diversity in timbre coincides with the fracturing of\nthe popular music audience\u2014and the vehemence with which listeners defend their\nfavourite genres.\n\nA common misconception is that timbres are just carrying melodies and rhythms,\nbut instrumentation can alter our perception of harmony. Change the\ninstruments and the piece of music is not going to sound the same. It can\nsound more or less dissonant, for instance, and that ebb and flow of\ndissonance and consonance is the underlying experience of harmony. Timbre\ncarries a lot of that information and we process it surprisingly quickly,\nwhich is why we can sometimes recognize a song in as little as a quarter of a\nsecond, long before we even hear the melody.\n\nAnd still we don\u2019t talk much about timbre. \u201cIf you look at music theory, they\ntalk about pitch and harmony, they\u2019ll talk about things like rhythm and\nmeter,\u201d McAdams said. \u201cAfter that it gets into things like voice leading and\ncounterpoint and harmony. And they never, ever talk about timbre.\u201d\n\nIf someone could find a way to measure timbre, we\u2019d likely take it more\nseriously. And McAdams is working on just that. It\u2019s not easy because timbre\nhas so many dimensions. In one study, his lab analyzed over six thousand\nsounds from a musical database and found around ten different classes of\nacoustic parameters that are independent of each other. Using that model,\nthere might be as many as ten dimensions to timbre. Capturing it\nmathematically will require quantifying attributes such as brightness, attack\ntime, effective duration and noisiness. Then it might be possible to come up\nwith the global measure, but McAdams has a lot more experiments to do before\nhe gets there.\n\nAnd that might not even be the best approach. Another possibility is that we\naren\u2019t perceiving music in terms of dimensions but as a complex\nspectromorphology, an electroacoustic term for the sonic footprint of a sound\nspectrum as it changes over time. With a trumpet, for example, there\u2019s a\nlittle high-frequency energy with the attack, and then primarily the low\nfrequencies come out first and the high frequencies come out later. And when\nthe sound goes away, the high frequencies go first and then the low\nfrequencies. Capturing all that information mathematically would be a\ndifficult challenge indeed.\n\nIf measuring the timbre of instruments will be hard, imagine trying to do it\nfor human voices. That would take us into snowflake territory (one reason\nMcAdams has done little research into vocal timbres). We don\u2019t fully\nunderstand how people react to different vocal timbres, whereas we do know how\nmost listeners respond to a beat that\u2019s above a resting heart rate or to\nsyncopated rhythms or big jumps in melodies. \u201cWe have simple ways to describe\nwhere the emotional content sits in those parameters,\u201d said Swoger-Ruston.\n\u201cBut with the human voice it\u2019s complex and so many things are going on.\u201d\n\nEven if McAdams can\u2019t solve the measurement puzzle, maybe his work will help\nmore people realize that the better we understand timbre, the better we will\nunderstand music\u2014and how we really perceive it.\n\nThis is an excerpt from Tim Falconer's Bad Singer: The Surprising Science of\nTone-Deafness and the Way We Hear Music, out May 14th from House of Anansi.\n\nFind us on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n\nTim Falconer\n\nTim Falconer is the author, most recently, of Bad Singer: The Surprising\nScience of Tone Deafness and How We Hear Music.
