One of the neat things about Cloudflare is that internal\ncandidates are encouraged to reach out to hiring managers to chat with them\nabout the role. That means that I\u2019ve had several really great conversations\nwith colleagues over the past couple of weeks, many of them with folks who are\nin other parts of the org like BI, customer support, finance, engineering,\netc. The question they have is, \u201chow do I move into product management?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a great question, and after I\u2019ve given the same answer a few times, I\ndecided to just go ahead and write it down in our internal wiki as well. Below\nis a lightly edited version of the advice I shared, in case that\u2019s helpful to\nanyone else who is trying to move into the PM role at their company:\n\n  * If you\u2019re brand new to the job I have a couple of book recommendations to get a general sense of what good product management looks like. I recommend starting with Inspired by Marty Cagan, and Escaping the Build Trap by Melissa Perri. You\u2019ll hear these two books mentioned a lot in our field, and they are classics for good reasons. After that, read everything you can get your hands on (but stay away from LinkedIn Influencers, that\u2019s mostly ChatGPT content these days). For more book/newsletter recommendations, I have a running list here.\n  * Then\u2014and this is the most important advice I have\u2014do the job before you have the title. Every role can be expanded into some area of product management. Think deeply about the product(s) you support, what customers need, how it contributes to the business, what could be better, what you think the long-term strategy should be. Start exercising the PM muscle so that when the right role comes along internally, you\u2019re ready for it.\n  * Publish your thinking. Every company has an internal wiki, many with personal spaces. Use it. If you have an idea for a product, or an analysis that\u2019s interesting, or some thoughts on future strategy, write it down, publish it, and share it with the PM who works on that product. This is the best way to practice for the job\u2014clear, succinct communication is a crucial skill, so this exercises that muscle as well.\n\nIf you learn the craft, practice the craft, and show publicly that you can do\nthe craft, you\u2019ll be well on your way to moving into product management at\nyour company. When a good job rolls around you\u2019ll be able to point towards the\nwork you\u2019ve done to give hiring managers a sense of your product skills.\n\nAnd lastly, this is a great job.
