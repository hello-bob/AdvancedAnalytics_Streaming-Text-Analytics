But those who blame cloud\nseeding are misguided.\n\nMotorists drive along a flooded street following heavy rains in Dubai early on\nApril 17, 2024.GIUSEPPE CACACE/Getty Images\n\nDubai is underwater. Heavy storms have caused flash flooding across the United\nArab Emirates, leading to shocking scenes circulating on social media: Cars\nabandoned by the roadside, planes sloshing through flooded runways. Hundreds\nof flights have been canceled at Dubai\u2019s busy international airport, and at\nleast 18 people have died in neighboring Oman.\n\nNews reports and social media posts were quick to point the blame at cloud\nseeding. The UAE has a long-running program for trying to squeeze more rain\nout of the clouds that pass over the normally arid region\u2014it has a team of\npilots who spray salt particles into passing storms to encourage more water to\nform. The floods were positioned as a cautionary tale by some: Here\u2019s what\nhappens when you mess with nature. Even Bloomberg reported that cloud seeding\nhad worsened the flooding.\n\nThe truth is more complicated. I\u2019ve spent the last few months reporting on\ncloud seeding in the UAE for an upcoming WIRED feature, and while it\u2019s true\nthat the UAE has been running cloud seeding missions this week\u2014it performs\nmore than 300 a year\u2014it\u2019s a stretch to say that it was responsible for the\nfloods. (In fact, as we were preparing this story for publication on Wednesday\nmorning, the UAE\u2019s National Center for Meteorology told CNBC it had not seeded\nany clouds before the storm struck on Tuesday.)\n\nFeatured Video\n\nThere are a few reasons for this. First: Even the most optimistic assessments\nof cloud seeding say that it can increase rainfall by a maximum of 25 percent\nannually. In other words, it would have rained anyway, and if cloud seeding\ndid have an impact, it would only have been to slightly increase the amount of\nprecipitation that fell. The jury is still out on the effectiveness of cloud\nseeding in warm climates, and even if it does work, cloud seeding can\u2019t\nproduce rain out of thin air, it can only enhance what\u2019s already in the sky.\n\nSecondly, seeding operations tend to take place in the east of the country,\nfar from more populated areas like Dubai. This is largely because of\nrestrictions on air traffic, but means that it was unlikely that any seeding\nparticles were still active by the time the storms reached Dubai. Most of the\nscientists I\u2019ve spoken to say the impact of cloud seeding has a very small,\nlocalized effect and is unlikely to cause flooding in other areas. But perhaps\nthe best evidence that cloud seeding wasn\u2019t involved in these floods is the\nfact that it rained all over the region. Oman didn\u2019t do any cloud seeding, but\nit was even more badly affected by flooding, with a number of casualties.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting to point the finger at a scary technology, but the real cause of\nthe flooding is likely more banal: Dubai is comically ill-equipped to deal\nwith rainfall. The city has expanded rapidly over the last few decades, with\nlittle attention paid in the past to infrastructure like storm drains that\ncould help it deal with a sudden influx of water. It\u2019s largely concrete and\nglass, and there\u2019s very little green space to soak up rainfall. The result is\nchaos whenever it rains\u2014though to be fair, most cities would struggle to deal\nwith a year\u2019s worth of rain falling in 12 hours.\n\nHowever, climate change may also be playing a role. As the planet heats up,\nthe complex weather dynamics of the region are shifting and changing in ways\nthat may bring more violent storms. City planners around the world are trying\nto make their cities \u201cspongier\u201d to help deal with flash flooding and save more\nwater for drier parts of the year. Instead of using cloud seeding to turn the\nsky into a sponge, Dubai would be better off trying to turn the city into one.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
