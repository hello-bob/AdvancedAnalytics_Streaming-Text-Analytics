The experience of China over\nmore than a decade provides compelling evidence on how this debate will be\nresolved. In December 2011 China\u2019s National Energy Administration announced\nthat China would make nuclear energy the foundation of its electricity\ngeneration system in the next \u201c10 to 20 years\u201d. Just over a decade later China\nhas wound back those ambitious targets and reoriented its low emission energy\nstrategy around the rapid deployment of renewable solar and wind energy at\nunprecedented rates.\n\nAustralia has seen a campaign against the use of renewable energy technologies\nand for the benefits of nuclear energy in developing Australia\u2019s future low\nemission energy systems. The Federal Opposition has now adopted this position\nas their policy. The recent experience of China provides a compelling\ncommentary on this decision.\n\nIn December 2011 China\u2019s National Energy Administration (NEA) announced that\nChina would make nuclear energy the foundation of its electricity generation\nsystem in the next \u201c10 to 20 years\u201d, adding as much as 300 gigawatts (GWe) of\nnuclear capacity over that period.\n\nThis was followed by a period of delay as China undertook a comprehensive\nreview of nuclear safety in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nSubsequently, moderated nuclear energy targets were established, aiming for a\nnuclear energy contribution of 15% of China\u2019s total electricity generation by\n2035, 20-25% by 2050 and 45% in the second half of the century.\n\nHowever by 2023 it was becoming clear that China\u2019s nuclear construction\nprogram was well behind schedule. The target for 2020 had not been achieved,\nand targets for subsequent 5-year plans were unlikely to be achieved.\n\nIn September 2023 the China Nuclear Energy Association (CNEA) reported that\nChina was now aiming to achieve a nuclear energy contribution of 10% by 2035,\nincreasing to around 18% by 2060.\n\nThe CNEA also indicated that \u2018greenlighting\u2019 of new construction would now be\nat the rate of 6-8 large nuclear power reactors per year \u2013 not the 10 per year\npreviously targeted for 2020-2035 and beyond. This will result in new nuclear\ngeneration increasing by 60-80 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually.\n\nMeanwhile the deployment of renewable energy (primarily solar and wind energy)\nwas dramatically accelerated in 2023, with the installation of 217GWe of new\nsolar capacity and 70GWe of new wind capacity.\n\nThis represents an increase of around 400TWh in annual low emission generation\n\u2013 the quantitative equivalent of 40 large nuclear power reactors, or four\ntimes the average annual output of the Three Gorges Dam hydroelectric system\n(the world\u2019s largest power station).\n\nIn 2023 energy analysts started reporting that China was now expected to\nachieve or exceed its 2030 target of 1200GWe for the total installed capacity\nof solar and wind energy by 2025, and was now planning to triple the 2030\nobjective, to reach 3900GWe.\n\nPreviously China expected that its energy emissions would peak in 2030, but\nrevised forecasts are now indicating that this could happen as early as 2024,\n5-6 years ahead of target.\n\nBy the end of 2023 it was clear that nuclear energy was no longer going to be\nthe foundation of China\u2019s future electricity generation system, and that this\ntask had shifted to renewable energy.\n\nSo what has happened? There\u2019s no single answer, but two key factors appear to\nbe at play.\n\nThe first is the emergence of renewable energy technologies at competitive\nscale and cost since 2011.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2022, the cost of solar PV modules declined by 85%, wind\nenergy costs by 60-70%, and battery costs by 90%.\n\nChina now dominates the global production of solar PV panels, wind turbines\nand batteries, with costs expected to continue to decline significantly for\nthe foreseeable future while performance improves.\n\nThe consequence is that renewable energy generation can now be deployed\neconomically at rates five to eight times faster than nuclear energy, which is\nconstrained by logistical and regulatory capability, safety, site availability\nand other factors.\n\nThe second is the slow delivery of new nuclear generation which contributed to\ncontinued \u2018greenlighting\u2019 of new coal-fired generation to underwrite energy\nsecurity, as it became clear that deployment rates for new low emission\nelectricity generation were insufficient to blunt demand from provincial\ngovernments for new coal-fired generators, even though many existing plants\nare operating at uneconomically low capacity factors.\n\nBy 2035, under the original plan, combined nuclear, solar and wind generation\nwould have been comparable to current coal generation but insufficient to meet\nsignificantly increased new electricity demand.\n\nUnder the new plans, combined solar, wind and nuclear generation is likely to\nmatch current coal generation and meet new demand, with solar and wind energy\ncontributing around 85% of this low emission generation.\n\nBy 2030 another factor will come into play, with China\u2019s battery giant CATL\ndeveloping long duration utility battery systems that will provide\ndispatchable electricity from renewable sources at competitive or lower costs\nthan either coal or nuclear generated electricity.\n\nThe central message here is that even in China \u2013 the world\u2019s largest\nindustrial economy and preeminent builder of advanced civil infrastructure in\nthe 21st century \u2013 nuclear energy cannot compete with renewable energy to\ndeliver low emission electricity generation at the deployment rates needed to\nmeet mid-century emission targets.\n\nDerek Woolner and David Glynne Jones co-author and publish articles on the\nimplications of emerging energy technologies for defence policy, strategy and\nfuture acquisition programs.\n\n### Share and Enjoy !\n\nSHARE TWEET SHARE COPY EMAIL PRINT\n\n##### Consider making a donation to support independent journalism\n\nPearls and Irritations relies totally on donations from its readers.
