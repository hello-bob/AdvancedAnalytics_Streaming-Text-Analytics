The move to expand government oversight of internet\nservice providers comes after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the magnitude of\nthe digital divide, forcing consumers to rely on high-speed internet for\nschool and work, as well as social and health support.\n\nRelated Story: What happened to the internet without net neutrality?\n\nBecause the government deems internet access an essential service, the FCC is\npromising oversight as if broadband were a public utility. In doing so, the\ngovernment aims to make providers more accountable for outages, require more\nrobust network security, protect fast speeds, and require greater protections\nfor consumer data.\n\nThe decision effectively restores so-called net neutrality rules that were\nfirst introduced during the Obama administration in 2015 and repealed two\nyears later under President Trump.\n\nThe rules are sure to invite legal challenges from the telecoms industry \u2014 not\nfor the first time. And a future administration could always undo the rules.\n\nMeanwhile, net neutrality regulations are set to go into effect 60 days after\ntheir publication in the Federal Register.\n\nBut much has yet to be clarified about the rules: The 400-page draft order to\nrestore the regulations has not been publicly released.\n\nHere's what we do know.\n\n### What's net neutrality?\n\nNet neutrality is a wonky term for the idea that the flow of information on\nthe internet should be treated equally and that internet service providers\ncan't interfere with what consumers do online.\n\nAlso referred to as an \"open internet,\" net neutrality aims to level the\ndigital marketplace, prohibiting internet service providers (ISPs) like\nComcast and AT&T from running fast lanes and slow lanes \u2014 speeding up or\nslowing down internet speeds \u2014 for online services like Netflix and Spotify.\n\n### What's this latest battle about?\n\nWithout the net neutrality regulations in place, phone and internet companies\nhave the power to block or favor some content over others. The issue has pit\ntelecom companies against Big Tech. Net neutrality advocates \u2014 tech companies,\nconsumer watchdogs and free speech activists among them \u2014 warn that without\nsuch regulations, broadband providers are incentivized to charge customers\nmore to use internet fast lanes or else risk being stuck with slower speeds.\n\nIn recent years, the issue has largely become a partisan one. In 2015, the\nPresident Obama-appointed FCC chair ushered in the approval of net neutrality\nrules. Those rules were repealed two years later under President Trump after\nhis pick to run the FCC called them \"heavy-handed\" in his pledge to end them.\n\nNow, the return of FCC regulations has reinvigorated the net neutrality\ndebate.\n\n\"Every consumer deserves internet access that is fast, open and fair,\" FCC\nchair Jessica Rosenworcel said ahead of Thursday's vote. \"This is common\nsense.\"\n\nAs in 2015, the rules classify broadband as a utility service under Title II\nof the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThe measure passed along party lines, with Democratic commissioners in favor\nof net neutrality and Republicans opposed.\n\n### What critics are saying\n\nOpponents say the net neutrality rules are government overreach and interfere\nwith commerce. In a letter to FCC chair Rosenworcel this week, a group of\nRepublican lawmakers said the draft order to restore net neutrality\nregulations would chill innovation and investment in the broadband industry.\n\nDissenting FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican, said that fears of a\nsluggish or pricey internet without the rules were overblown \u2014 that consumers\nbenefited from faster speeds and lower prices since the repeal. Net neutrality\nadvocates dispute the argument that broadband rates dropped when net\nneutrality went away, saying the numbers are misleading.\n\n\"There will be lots of talk about 'net neutrality' and virtually none about\nthe core issue before the agency: namely, whether the FCC should claim for\nitself the freewheeling power to micromanage nearly every aspect of how the\nInternet functions \u2014 from the services that consumers can access to the prices\nthat can be charged,\" Carr said in October, when the Biden administration\nproposed restoring net neutrality.\n\nSome telecom companies argue that the FCC is trying to solve a nonexistent\nproblem in its stated aim to preserve equal internet access for consumers.\n\n\"This is a nonissue for broadband consumers, who have enjoyed an open internet\nfor decades,\" said Jonathan Spalter, the CEO of USTelecom, a trade group that\nrepresents ISPs such as AT&T and Verizon, in a statement following the vote to\nhand regulatory authority back to the FCC.\n\n\"We plan to pursue all available options, including in the courts,\" the group\nsaid.\n\n### What's happened when net neutrality went away?\n\nWhat ended up happening in the years after the rollback went into effect in\n2018 was so discreet that most people unlikely noticed its effects, says\nStanford Law professor Barbara van Schewick, who directs the school's Center\nfor Internet and Society and supports net neutrality.\n\nFor the past six years, she says, \"a lot of public scrutiny on the ISPs and\nthen the attempts to bring back net neutrality in Congress basically kept the\nISPs on their best behavior.\"\n\nStill, there were changes. Some ISPs implemented zero-rating plans, the\npractice of excluding some apps from data charges, she notes, or were caught\nthrottling \u2014 intentionally slowing down consumer internet speeds.\n\nAbsent heightened federal regulation, tough net neutrality rules that sprang\nup in several states, including California, Washington and Oregon, also have\ncontinued to keep internet service providers in check.\n\n\"It's still being litigated,\" van Schewick says. \"And so, it is fair to say we\nhaven't seen a world without net neutrality.\"\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
