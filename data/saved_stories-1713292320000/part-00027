New\nlaboratory testing methods had allowed them to differentiate between organic\nand inorganic arsenic. Inorganic is more toxic and this Arsenic in Rice was\nfound in dangerous concentrations. The FDA proposed a limit for infant rice\ncereals, but not for other rice products. Arsenic is a naturally occurring\nmetal in the earth\u2019s crust. It gets absorbed by plants. Rice is particularly\ngood at absorbing it, hence the high concentration. When Unicef installed\nthousands of water tube wells in Bangladesh to provide access to pathogen-free\nwater, they, unfortunately, did not test the groundwater and did not find out\nabout the high arsenic contamination until a few years later when people\nstarted to show arsenic toxicity. This is considered the largest poisoning of\na population in history. 10% of the population of the affected areas in\nBangladesh is expected to get arsenic-induced cancers. Many more will suffer\nother ill effects due to the arsenic.\n\nFamily Health Priorities\n\nMany of us, especially those with children on gluten-free diets, have been\nscared by the news that arsenic can cause skin, lung and bladder cancer, type\n2 diabetes, heart disease, and possibly neurological problems. The situation\nis all the more concerning because many children with health and developmental\nproblems are not great at detoxifying. So while healthy people would excrete\nthe arsenic easily, it may accumulate in those who are poor detoxifiers and\nreach higher levels in the body and cause more problems. The way arsenic\ncauses its toxic effect is via oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is like\ninternal rusting \u2013 the damage done by free oxygen radicals that deplete the\nbody of antioxidants, such as glutathione. The cascade of oxidative stress\nends in damage to our genetic material, the DNA, and mitochondria (energy\nproducing factories in our cells).\n\nRemoving Arsenic in Rice \u2013 and Reversing Damage\n\nMany of the children who go on gluten-free diets, for example, children on the\nautism spectrum, may have mitochondrial dysfunction which makes it harder to\nfight oxidative stress. So we are facing a double whammy: children who do not\ncope with oxidative stress and toxins are on a diet that exposes them to\narsenic which is toxic and causes oxidative stress. But do not despair. There\nis good news. Researchers have been looking for ways to mitigate the toxic\neffects of arsenic and they have been successful: there are ways to wash some\nof the arsenic out of rice and in one study 500mg of curcumin taken twice\ndaily by adult Bangladeshis reversed the DNA damage caused by arsenic.\n\nReduce Exposure to the Toxic Effects of Arsenic in Rice\n\nHere is a list of what you can do to reduce exposure to the toxic effects of\narsenic.\n\n1\\. First of all, you can choose types of rice that contain less arsenic \u2022\nWhite Basmati from India, Pakistan, and California contains the least arsenic\n\u2022 Brown rice has more arsenic because the toxin accumulates in the outer\nlayer, the husk (which is removed in the process of making white rice) For\nwhole-foods aficionados like me, it has been very reassuring to find out that\nthe amount of arsenic absorbed by the body is the same in white and brown rice\nbecause the fibre in the whole grain brown rice interferes with the absorption\nof the toxin. White rice consumption brings a whole new set of problems \u2013 it\nlacks fibre, is low in minerals and vitamins, and has been shown to increase\nthe risk of type 2 diabetes. Given that the body is exposed to about the same\namount of arsenic from the overall healthier brown rice, I would always choose\nthat. Organic rice may be a bit safer because arsenic-containing pesticides\nare still being phased out \u2013 which means they are still around until they are\nused up.\n\n2\\. You can Reduce Arsenic in Rice by 80% by Preparing it Correctly It is easy\nto do, just takes a little extra planning and time.\n\n\u2022 Soak the rice overnight, then rinse it under running water;\n\n\u2022 Cook 1 cup of rice in 5-6 cups of water (like pasta) and drain the water at\nthe end The more traditional way of cooking rice in double the amount of water\nuntil all the water is absorbed leaves much higher amounts of arsenic in your\nfood.\n\n3\\. Eat Less Rice and try other Gluten-Free, Low-Arsenic grains\n\nThese include: \u2022 Quinoa \u2022 Buckwheat \u2022 Millet\n\nThese grains do not absorb arsenic from the soil. It is a good idea to have a\nvaried diet anyway \u2013 remember that our ancestors ate hundreds of different\nfoods \u2013 mainly plants \u2013 compared to our staple few. Restrict yourself to 2\nservings of rice per week. Do not drink rice milk.\n\n4\\. Eat Plenty of Vegetables and Herbs\n\nThese are high in antioxidants; they provide vitamin C, E, and other\nantioxidants and help you produce glutathione, the antioxidant that arsenic\ndepletes. The more vegetables and fruit you eat, the higher your beta-carotene\nlevel (a precursor of vitamin A) and this protects you against the toxic\neffects of arsenic.\n\n5\\. Cook with Turmeric The Indian spice Turmeric contains curcumin. Also,\nconsider taking curcumin as a supplement \u2013 which has been shown to reverse the\ntoxic effects of arsenic.
