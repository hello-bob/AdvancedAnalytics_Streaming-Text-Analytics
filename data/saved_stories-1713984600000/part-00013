The Court also ruled that Cribl\u2019s use of Splunk\u2019s\nEnterprise software for the purpose of testing and troubleshooting Cribl\u2019s S2S\nintegration with Splunk Enterprise is also fair use. In doing so, the Court\naffirms the lawfulness under the Copyright Act of building interoperable\nproducts in the tech industry and protects the ability for different software\nprograms to work together to bring innovative products to market.\n\nCertain other claims in Splunk\u2019s lawsuit against Cribl were dismissed,\nincluding alleged violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),\nand tortious interference with prospective business relations. Over a year\nago, the Court had also found Splunk\u2019s asserted patents invalid as\nunpatentable. The jury awarded Splunk $1 for Cribl's use of Splunk Enterprise\nfor other residual uses in violation of the Splunk General Terms and\nunderlying copyright. The Court will rule on the remaining equitable claims\nand defenses in post-trial briefing.\n\n\u201cInteroperability is the bedrock of tech and this ruling reinforces that using\nanother product to ensure interoperability is a legitimate application of fair\nuse. This is great news not just for Cribl, but for the tech industry at\nlarge,\u201d said Clint Sharp, co-founder and CEO at Cribl. \u201cWe are incredibly\ngrateful for the time and attention of the Court and jurors in determining\nthis important outcome. Our mission is to empower customers with choice for\ntheir data and this ruling makes certain that customers can continue to take\ncontrol of their data in the tools that best suit their needs, today and in\nthe future.\u201d\n\nThis decision provides additional legal certainty to the common practice in\nthe software industry of using copyrighted software to build interoperable\nfeatures and products. Critical for the industry, reverse engineering once\nagain is affirmed by the Court as fair use under copyright law, including\nreverse engineering communication protocols.\n\n\u201cCribl Stream will continue to be interoperable with Splunk Enterprise. With\nthis distraction behind us, we look forward to continuing to deliver value to\nour customers through building innovative products. With this behind us, we\nwould welcome the chance to renew our partnership with Splunk, a great company\nwith products our joint customers love,\u201d said Sharp.\n\nAbout Cribl Cribl, the Data Engine for IT and Security, empowers organizations\nto transform their data strategy.
