Mike Turner, R-Ohio, wanted to know how long the weapon\nwould leave low-Earth orbit unusable.\n\n\u201cCould it be a year?\u201d asked Turner, who in February tweeted about a\n\"destabilizing foreign military capability,\" which led to reports about Russia\nfielding a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cI believe it could be,\u201d Plumb said.\n\nRelated articles\n\nRussian space nuke wouldn\u2019t alter US orbital-network plans, Space Force says\n\nIs Russia putting an anti-satellite nuke in space?\n\nPlumb had confirmed in written testimony that the weapon is intended to be a\nsatellite in orbit, but wouldn\u2019t say which orbit when questioned by Turner.\n\nRussia is developing a \u201cconcerning anti-satellite capability related to a new\nsatellite carrying a nuclear device that Russia is developing. This capability\ncould pose a threat to all satellites operated by countries and companies\naround the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific,\nmeteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services we\nall depend upon,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe threat is not \u201cimminent,\u201d Plumb said at the hearing, but the department is\nconcerned because Russia recently vetoed a United Nations resolution that\nwould have reaffirmed a ban on placing nuclear weapons in space.\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\n\u201cWe just had that United Nations Security Council resolution that Russia\nvetoed which may in fact tip their hand on this. [The resolution] really just\nreaffirmed not placing nuclear weapons in outer space, which Russia and the\nUnited States and all spacefaring nations have already signed up not to do, so\nthis is a concern for us,\u201d Plumb said.\n\nPlumb called Russia \u201chypocritical\u201d and \u201cunbelievable\u201d for claiming it won\u2019t\ndeploy weapons in space while refusing to sign the U.N. resolution.\n\nHe was echoing sentiments expressed by Sullivan last week. \u201cWe have heard\nPresident Putin say publicly that Russia has no intention of deploying nuclear\nweapons in space. If that were the case, Russia would not have vetoed this\nresolution,\u201d according to a statement the national security adviser released\nafter the U.N. vote.\n\nShare This:\n\nNEXT STORY: The D Brief: UK eyes Chinese drone parts; Russia\u2019s arms plan; Air\nForce cost breach; Austin to the Pacific; And a bit more.\n\nFarewell to China\u2019s Strategic Support Force.
