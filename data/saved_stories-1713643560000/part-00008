Yet in a single week, two governments \u2013 both long-established\ndemocracies \u2013 stand accused of violating, in different ways, the laws\nsurrounding foreign diplomatic missions.\n\nFirst, on April 1, 2024, Iran\u2019s embassy in Damascus was bombed, presumably by\nIsrael, killing several high-ranking commanders of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Then, on April 5, Ecuadorian police forced\ntheir way into the Mexican Embassy in Quito to arrest a former vice president\nof Ecuador who was seeking political asylum.\n\nBoth actions have led to claims of international law violations and\naccusations that the Vienna Convention, which establishes the immunity of\ndiplomatic missions, was contravened.\n\nAs someone with a fair amount of knowledge of embassy life \u2013 I have served as\nChile\u2019s head of mission in China, India and South Africa and coedited The\nOxford Handbook of Modern Diplomacy \u2013 I believe the two incidents are of\ngreater concern than much of the international community appears to be viewing\nthem.\n\nContrary to the famous quip from late businessman and presidential candidate\nRoss Perot, embassies are not just \u201crelics of the days of sailing ships.\u201d\nRather, in an increasingly complex world where geopolitical conflict, mass\nmigrations, pandemics and climate change require careful and stable diplomatic\nmanagement, any incidents that erode the sanctity of embassy rules could have\nserious negative consequences. In short, they make for a more dangerous world.\n\n## Curious indifference to embassy attack\n\nOf the two recent incidents, the Iranian embassy bombing is the more serious,\nas it involved the loss of life and resulted in warnings of retaliatory\nattacks.\n\nYet, Western countries, leaders of which often voice concern over upholding\nthe so-called \u201crules-based order,\u201d have been reluctant to condemn the act.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei attends the funerals of victims\nof an April 1, 2024, attack on the Iranian Embassy in Damascus.

Security Council\n\u2013 the United States, the United Kingdom and France \u2013 all refused to condemn\nthe strike on Iran\u2019s embassy when the issue came up before them.\n\nIsrael, while not officially acknowledging responsibility, argued that the\nIranian ambassador\u2019s residence was not really a diplomatic venue but \u201ca\nmilitary building ... disguised as a civilian building.\u201d As such, to Israel it\nwas a perfectly legitimate target.\n\nBut by this logic, nearly all embassies would be seen as fair game.\n\nAlmost by definition, the vast majority of embassies \u2013 particularly of the\nlarger countries \u2013 are populated with significant numbers of military and\nintelligence personnel. To suggest that for that reason embassies should lose\ntheir diplomatic immunity and become legitimate targets for armed attacks\nwould bring the whole edifice of the Vienna Convention crashing down. And with\nit would come the structure on which worldwide formal diplomatic interactions\nare based.\n\n## Bedrock diplomatic principles\n\nThe case of Ecuador, though less serious because it did not involve loss of\nlife, is a bit more complex and demands some unpacking.\n\nAt the center of the diplomatic spat between Ecuador and Mexico is former\nEcuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas, who served four years behind bars\nfollowing a 2017 conviction on corruption charges.\n\nGlas is now facing trial on different charges, prompting his December 2023\napplication for asylum at the Mexican Embassy. Mexico accepted the request and\nconveyed this to the Ecuadorian government.\n\nFormer Ecuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas is led away from the Mexican\nEmbassy. National Police of Ecuador/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nThe latter justified its decision to send police into the Mexican embassy on\nthe grounds that it believes Glas cannot be granted political asylum as he is\na convicted felon.\n\nThere is some basis to this claim: Under the Organization of American States\u2019\nConvention on the Right to Asylum of 1954, political asylum cannot be given to\nconvicted felons unless the charges behind such conviction are of a political\nnature.\n\nBut at the same time, Article 21 of the Vienna Convention states that\ndiplomatic missions enjoy full immunity and extraterritoriality, meaning the\nhost government does not have the right to enter an embassy without the\nauthorization of the head of mission.\n\nEcuador argues that Mexico abused its diplomatic immunity, leaving it no\noption other than to send police in.\n\nYet, here a crucial distinction needs to be made.\n\nDiplomatic immunity and the extraterritoriality of foreign missions are\nbedrock principles of the Vienna Convention. Political asylum is a separate\nmatter that should be handled on its own.\n\nAs such, if the Ecuadorian government considered Glas not to qualify for\npolitical asylum, it could have attempted to legally block the move or refuse\nsafe passage for the asylum-seeker to exit the embassy and leave the country.\nMexico would have strong grounds to counter such measures, however, as\naccording to the Convention on the Right to Asylum of 1954, it is up to the\nasylum-granting state to decide whether the case is politically motivated.\n\n## Implications for the future\n\nRegardless of the merits of the asylum case, sending in the equivalent of a\nSWAT team to storm the embassy represents a deliberate violation of diplomatic\nnorms.\n\nThere is a long history of Latin America politicians seeking asylum who spent\nmany years holed up in embassy buildings because governments would not grant\nthem safe passage \u2013 the most notable being Peruvian leader V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de\nla Torre, who spent five years at the Colombian Embassy in Lima.\n\nYet, with a few exceptions, not even in the darkest hour of Latin America\u2019s\nmilitary dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s were police permitted to storm\ninto embassy buildings to arrest asylum-seekers.\n\nAnd this highlights what makes Ecuador\u2019s actions especially worrisome.\n\nPrecisely because of Latin America\u2019s problems with political instability and a\ntradition of military coup, the laws surrounding political asylum and\ndiplomatic immunity are necessary.\n\nUndermining the Vienna Convention in the way Ecuador has risks setting a\nprecedent that other governments might be tempted to follow.\n\nPolitical asylum in Latin America has traditionally worked as a safety valve,\nallowing deposed leaders to get themselves out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nWeakening the diplomatic structures in place supporting asylum will make the\nhandling of democratic breakdowns more difficult. It also risks exacerbating\nregional disagreements. We are already seeing this with Mexico breaking\nrelations with Ecuador as a result of the embassy raid.\n\n## Making diplomacy more difficult\n\nOf course, embassy violations are not unprecedented. Guatemala\u2019s dictatorship\nattacked the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City in 1980, killing several\nasylum-seekers, including a former vice president. And Uruguay\u2019s military\ngovernment sent security forces into the Venezuelan Embassy in Montevideo in\n1976 to arrest a left-wing militant who had sought asylum, leading to the\nbreakdown of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n\nBut those events in the relatively distant past were widely and rightly\ncondemned at the time as the product of authoritarian regimes with little\nregard for international conventions.\n\nThe comparatively relaxed international attitude to the embassy violations by\nIsrael and Ecuador reflects, I believe, a failure to grasp the significance of\neroding diplomatic immunity and norms.\n\nAs global challenges increase, embassies and their representatives become more\nimportant, not less so.\n\nIf the takeaway from the two latest embassy incidents is that the protection\nof diplomatic premises can be secondary to whatever is politically expedient\non any given day, then it will be of great detriment to the management of\ninternational relations. Diplomacy will become much more difficult.\n\nAnd given the enormity of the challenges the world faces today, that is the\nlast thing any country needs.\n\n  * Diplomacy\n  * Israel\n  * Middle East\n  * United Nations\n  * International relations\n  * Mexico\n  * Iran\n  * Embassy\n  * Ecuador\n  * Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations\n  * International laws\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Senior Disability Services Advisor\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\n  * ##### GRAINS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CHAIRPERSON\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
