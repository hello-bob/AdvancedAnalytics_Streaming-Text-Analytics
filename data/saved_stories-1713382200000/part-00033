This blog\nseeks to clarify our role and responsibilities.\n\nNatural England provides scientific advice about the natural world to the\nGovernment, local authorities, and developers so they can design and build\nsustainable communities without harming Nature. It is not our job to say\nwhether it is more important than other priorities.\n\nNatural England\u2019s role in the planning system - as defined by Parliament - is\nto ensure that the potential environmental impacts of any proposal are taken\ninto account by the relevant decision-making body. That body will weigh up our\nadvice alongside other factors in reaching its decision. This advisory role is\nin line with part of our statutory purpose to contribute to sustainable\ndevelopment.\n\nIt is the local planning authority that makes the final decision on local\nplanning applications. When making their decision, planning authorities must\nconsider whether the impacts on protected species have been addressed in line\nwith the relevant environmental laws. Natural England provides guidance for\nlocal planning authorities on protected species and development.\n\nFor the Norwich Western Link (NWL) the local planning authority is Norfolk\nCounty Council. The Council is also the developer for the scheme. As the\ndeveloper, it is the Council\u2019s responsibility to show there is no satisfactory\nalternative to their scheme and that the conservation status of the bats will\nnot be negatively affected by the scheme.\n\nOn the Council's application for the NWL, and their previous scheme for the\nNorwich Northern Distributor Road, Natural England has been working closely\nwith them and the Council has been aware that the current road proposal may\naffect the population of Barbastelle bats for more than 10 years. Barbastelle\nbats are protected by environmental laws.\n\nA question was raised about the Favourable Conservation Status definition for\nBarbastelles, which was published on 8 March 2024. Natural England publishes\nFavourable Conservation Status (FCS) definitions that describe the conditions\nin which priority species and habitats can be considered thriving across their\nrange. This is part of a series of FCS definitions Natural England is\npublishing, endorsed by Defra in 2015, to help Local Planning Authorities and\nother statutory bodies where protected species are potentially impacted by\ndevelopment.\n\nThese assessments do not introduce new targets or rules, but are intended to\nprovide the most comprehensive overview of current knowledge on status to help\nplanners, decision makers and practitioners meet their aspirations and legal\nduties to protect and recover nature.\n\nThe FCS Test is a key stage in wildlife licensing and for Habitats Regulations\nAssessments, where bodies are required to determine whether a development or\nproject is likely to impact on FCS for habitats and species. Natural England\npublishes FCS definitions at an England level to collate evidence to assist\nwith this process.\n\nAt the UN Biodiversity Conference in December 2022 (COP15), the UK formally\nmade commitments to, among other things, reduce the risk of extinction faced\nby threatened species and to protect and conserve a minimum of 30% of land and\nsea for biodiversity by 2030. Known as 30x30, this latter target is an\noverarching commitment of the government\u2019s Environmental Improvement Plan and\nkey to Natural England\u2019s mission of building partnerships to achieve thriving\nNature for people and planet.\n\nTags: Barbastelle, Barbastelle bats, Bats\n\n## Sharing and comments\n\n### Share this page\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n\n### Leave a comment\n\nCancel reply\n\n## Related content and links\n\n### Stories and updates from Natural England\n\nWe\u2019re the government\u2019s adviser for the natural environment, helping to protect\nEngland\u2019s nature and landscapes for people to enjoy.\n\nThis blog gives an insight into our work.\n\nFind out more.\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Providing guidance to protect habitats and threatened native species 16 April 2024\n  * Welcoming the Government response to the Independent Review of Protected Site Management on Dartmoor 10 April 2024\n  * Working together to meet government targets for tree planting in England 8 April 2024\n  * Biodiversity Net Gain: guest insights on planning BNG for small sites 4 April 2024\n  * England Ecosystem Survey: introducing England\u2019s largest ever field survey 3 April 2024\n\n### Sign up and manage updates\n\n  * Email\n  * Atom\n\n### Follow us\n\n  * Natural England on Twitter\n  * Natural England on Instagram\n  * Natural England on YouTube\n  * Natural England on LinkedIn\n\n## Useful links\n\n  * All GOV.UK blogs\n  * All GOV.UK blog posts\n  * GOV.UK\n  * All departments\n  * Accessibility statement\n  * Cookies\n\nAll content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where\notherwise stated\n\n\u00a9 Crown copyright\n\n", "frontpage": false}
