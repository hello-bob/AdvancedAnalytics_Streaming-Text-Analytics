A. Uspensky\n\nPublication date\n\n    1983\n\nTopics\n\n    mir books, mathematics, post's machine, computers, children, alogrithms\n\nCollection\n\n    mir-titles; additional_collections\n\nLanguage\n\n    English\n\nV. A. Uspensky Post\u2019s Machine (Little Mathematics Library)\n\n> This booklet is intended first of all for school children. The first two\n> chapters are comprehensible even for junior schoolchildren. The book deals\n> with a certain \u201ctoy\u201d (\u201cabstract\u201d in scientific terms) computing machine \u2013\n> the so called Post machine \u2013 on which calculations involve many important\n> features inherent in the computations on real electronic computers. By means\n> of the simplest examples the students are taught the fundamentals of\n> programming for the Post machine, and the machine, though extremely simple,\n> is found to possess quite high potentialities.The reader is not expected to\n> have any knowledge of mathematics beyond the primary school curriculum.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by R. Alavina and was first published\nby Mir in 1983. Contents of the book are as under:\n\n1\\. How the Post Machine Works 9 Sec. 1.1. \u201cAn Outward Appearance\u201d of the Post\nMachine Sec. 1.2.
