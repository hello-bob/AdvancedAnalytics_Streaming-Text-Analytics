Robotaxis travel millions of miles a year on\npublic roads in an effort to gather data from sensors\u2014including cameras,\nradar, and lidar\u2014to train the neural networks that operate them.\n\nIn recent years, due to a striking improvement in the fidelity and realism of\ncomputer graphics technology, simulation is increasingly being used to\naccelerate the development of these algorithms. Waymo, for example, says its\nautonomous vehicles have already driven some 20 billion miles in simulation.\nIn fact, all kinds of machines, from industrial robots to drones, are\ngathering a growing amount of their training data and practice hours inside\nvirtual worlds.\n\nAccording to Gautham Sholingar, a senior manager at Nvidia focused on\nautonomous vehicle simulation, one key benefit is accounting for obscure\nscenarios for which it would be nearly impossible to gather training data in\nthe real world.\n\n\u201cWithout simulation, there are some scenarios that are just hard to account\nfor. There will always be edge cases which are difficult to collect data for,\neither because they are dangerous and involve pedestrians or things that are\nchallenging to measure accurately like the velocity of faraway objects. That\u2019s\nwhere simulation really shines,\u201d he told me in an interview for Singularity\nHub.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t ethical to have someone run unexpectedly into a street to train\nAI to handle such a situation, it\u2019s significantly less problematic for an\nanimated character inside a virtual world.\n\nIndustrial use of simulation has been around for decades, something Sholingar\npointed out, but a convergence of improvements in computing power, the ability\nto model complex physics, and the development of the GPUs powering today\u2019s\ngraphics indicate we may be witnessing a turning point in the use of simulated\nworlds for AI training.\n\nGraphics quality matters because of the way AI \u201csees\u201d the world.\n\nWhen a neural network processes image data, it\u2019s converting each pixel\u2019s color\ninto a corresponding number. For black and white images, the number ranges\nfrom 0, which indicates a fully black pixel, up to 255, which is fully white,\nwith numbers in between representing some variation of grey. For color images,\nthe widely used RGB (red, green, blue) model can correspond to over 16 million\npossible colors. So as graphics rendering technology becomes ever more\nphotorealistic, the distinction between pixels captured by real-world cameras\nand ones rendered in a game engine is falling away.\n\nSimulation is also a powerful tool because it\u2019s increasingly able to generate\nsynthetic data for sensors beyond just cameras. While high-quality graphics\nare both appealing and familiar to human eyes, which is useful in training\ncamera sensors, rendering engines are also able to generate radar and lidar\ndata as well. Combining these synthetic datasets inside a simulation allows\nthe algorithm to train using all the various types of sensors commonly used by\nAVs.\n\nDue to their expertise in producing the GPUs needed to generate high-quality\ngraphics, Nvidia have positioned themselves as leaders in the space. In 2021,\nthe company launched Omniverse, a simulation platform capable of rendering\nhigh-quality synthetic sensor data and modeling real-world physics relevant to\na variety of industries. Now, developers are using Omniverse to generate\nsensor data to train autonomous vehicles and other robotic systems.\n\nIn our discussion, Sholingar described some specific ways these types of\nsimulations may be useful in accelerating development. The first involves the\nfact that with a bit of retraining, perception algorithms developed for one\ntype of vehicle can be re-used for other types as well. However, because the\nnew vehicle has a different sensor configuration, the algorithm will be seeing\nthe world from a new point of view, which can reduce its performance.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you developed your AV on a sedan, and you need to go to an SUV.\nWell, to train it then someone must change all the sensors and remount them on\nan SUV. That process takes time, and it can be expensive. Synthetic data can\nhelp accelerate that kind of development,\u201d Sholingar said.\n\nAnother area involves training algorithms to accurately detect faraway\nobjects, especially in highway scenarios at high speeds. Since objects over\n200 meters away often appear as just a few pixels and can be difficult for\nhumans to label, there isn\u2019t typically enough training data for them.\n\n\u201cFor the far ranges, where it\u2019s hard to annotate the data accurately, our goal\nwas to augment those parts of the dataset,\u201d Sholingar said. \u201cIn our\nexperiment, using our simulation tools, we added more synthetic data and\nbounding boxes for cars at 300 meters and ran experiments to evaluate whether\nthis improves our algorithm\u2019s performance.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sholingar, these efforts allowed their algorithm to detect\nobjects more accurately beyond 200 meters, something only made possible by\ntheir use of synthetic data.\n\nWhile many of these developments are due to better visual fidelity and\nphotorealism, Sholingar also stressed this is only one aspect of what makes\ncapable real-world simulations.\n\n\u201cThere is a tendency to get caught up in how beautiful the simulation looks\nsince we see these visuals, and it\u2019s very pleasing. What really matters is how\nthe AI algorithms perceive these pixels. But beyond the appearance, there are\nat least two other major aspects which are crucial to mimicking reality in a\nsimulation.\u201d\n\nFirst, engineers need to ensure there is enough representative content in the\nsimulation. This is important because an AI must be able to detect a diversity\nof objects in the real world, including pedestrians with different colored\nclothes or cars with unusual shapes, like roof racks with bicycles or\nsurfboards.\n\nSecond, simulations have to depict a wide range of pedestrian and vehicle\nbehavior. Machine learning algorithms need to know how to handle scenarios\nwhere a pedestrian stops to look at their phone or pauses unexpectedly when\ncrossing a street. Other vehicles can behave in unexpected ways too, like\ncutting in close or pausing to wave an oncoming vehicle forward.\n\n\u201cWhen we say realism in the context of simulation, it often ends up being\nassociated only with the visual appearance part of it, but I usually try to\nlook at all three of these aspects. If you can accurately represent the\ncontent, behavior, and appearance, then you can start moving in the direction\nof being realistic,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also became clear in our conversation that while simulation will be an\nincreasingly valuable tool for generating synthetic data, it isn\u2019t going to\nreplace real-world data collection and testing.\n\n\u201cWe should think of simulation as an accelerator to what we do in the real\nworld. It can save time and money and help us with a diversity of edge-case\nscenarios, but ultimately it is a tool to augment datasets collected from\nreal-world data collection,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond Omniverse, the wider industry of helping \u201cthings that move\u201d develop\nautonomy is undergoing a shift toward simulation. Tesla announced they\u2019re\nusing similar technology to develop automation in Unreal Engine, while\nCanadian startup, Waabi, is taking a simulation-first approach to training\ntheir self-driving software. Microsoft, meanwhile, has experimented with a\nsimilar tool to train autonomous drones, although the project was recently\ndiscontinued.\n\nWhile training and testing in the real world will remain a crucial part of\ndeveloping autonomous systems, the continued improvement of physics and\ngraphics engine technology means that virtual worlds may offer a low-stakes\nsandbox for machine learning algorithms to mature into functional tools that\ncan power our autonomous future.\n\nImage Credit: Nvidia\n\n  * Tags\n  * Artificial Intelligence\n  * Automation\n  * Robotics\n\nShare\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddIt\n\nEmail\n\nCopy URL\n\nAaron Frank\n\nAaron Frank is a researcher, writer, and consultant who has spent over a\ndecade in Silicon Valley, where he most recently served as principal faculty\nat Singularity University.
