Via a\nconfiguration file, or via pragma which would be generated based on a\nconfiguration, feature sets could be set at run time.\n\nOne fault with this would be the issue of COMPILED size. I realize we're in an\nage where we generally talk megabytes instead of kilobytes in regards to main\nthread compiled code, but I'm sure there are platforms out there that are\nusing SQLite that have to fit in the kilobyte range, and need special compiled\nsources.\n\nThe advantage to this is that I wouldn't have to compile X number of DLLs for\nY number of programs to get the results I need, just have one configuration\nfile kicking around that I can adjust as needed.

Perhaps normally we'd blame the\nuser for such a na\u00c3 \u0304ve query, but when coupled with the first optimisation,\nspotting this optimisation does actually start to make sense.

It still only really\napplies when the user's query (which we're translating to SQL) contains only\n'OR' and no 'AND' clauses. It doesn't help me translate a query in the general\ncase.\n\nNow, I'm not *entirely* averse to having a special case for the 'all OR' query\n\u00e2 this particular query is the address autocompletion so it's common and the\nuser is actually waiting for it as they type. In fact, as a proof of concept\nI've already *implemented* a hackish special case to spot this case and\nbasically submit a hand-crafted query instead of the normal translation to\nSQL: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699597#c19\n\nThe problem is that I don't *want* to have to have that special case. This is\njust a query optimisation, which is something the query planner is supposed to\ndo. I don't *want* to implement this and other optimisations in the client,\njust to trick *today's* sqlite query planner into spotting the best way to do\nit. That's the Wrong Way\u00e2\u00a2 to do things.\n\nThere are two alternative approaches which *don't* seem as wrong.\n\nFirstly, if there's a sane way to rewrite our translator so that it naturally\nuses UNION for OR clauses, that might make sense. But to cope with AND\nclauses, AFAICT the natural extension of that approach would be to use 'SELECT\nFROM ... SELECT FROM' and then we lose the use of indices for *those* cases,\nright\u00c21? Tristan started a thread about this 'nested select' last year, which\nI picked up a couple of weeks ago. It didn't seem like it was a viable\nstrategy for the general case.\n\nThe second approach, and this is why I started this thread, is to 'fix' the\nquery planner so that that it can see for *itself* the best way to implement a\ngiven query given the constraints.\n\nI suggested a couple of specific optimisations which the query planner might\nbe able to make, which should hopefully have benefits wider than just my own\nuse case. Are those not viable? -- dwmw2\n\n\u00c21 I do realise that in the special case of a single top-level AND such that\nall its sub-clauses are necessary conditions, I can do something nicer. But\nagain, it's a special case and doesn't handle the general case of nested AND\nand OR clauses. And it's still the *client* code doing the job of the\noptimiser, spotting necessary vs. sufficient conditions and pulling them out\nto the top level for more efficient implementation.\n\nDavid Woodhouse\n\n10 years ago\n\nPermalink\n\nPost by David Woodhouse I suggested a couple of specific optimisations which\nthe query planner might be able to make, which should hopefully have benefits\nwider than just my own use case.

Before I do, is it worth me\nrephrasing this as a 'suboptimal query plan' bug report so it gets tracked and\nmight get attention later? Or should I just forget the idea of getting it\nfixed in sqlite?\n\n...\n\nWell, you could always create a patch...\n\nI think I understand the second optimization. You're saying that given this:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT main.uid FROM main LEFT JOIN email_list ON main.uid =\nemail_list.uid WHERE email_list.email LIKE 'al%'\n\nSQLite should deduce that since the LIKE implies \"email_list.email IS NOT\nNULL\" the LEFT JOIN is equivalent to a regular JOIN. Which would allow SQLite\nto reorder the tables and perhaps come up with a more efficient query plan.\nCorrect?\n\nSeems like a reasonable idea.\n\nThe first optimization might be trickier. With queries that feature a single\ntable:\n\nSELECT cols FROM tbl WHERE a=? OR b=? OR c=?\n\nthe planner may elect to run something very close to this:\n\nSELECT cols FROM tbl WHERE a=? UNION ALL SELECT cols FROM tbl WHERE b=? UNION\nALL SELECT cols FROM tbl WHERE c=?\n\nHowever, after returning each row, we remember its PRIMARY KEY (either the\nrowid or real PK for WITHOUT ROWID tables). Similar transformations for\nindividual loops within join queries are also possible.\n\nHowever, with a JOIN query, we don't currently attempt this kind of transform.\nI think because we would have to create some kind of composite key to use in\nplace of the PRIMARY KEY to avoid returning duplicates. I guess queries that\nhave a DISTINCT clause don't have this problem. So it could in theory\ntransform your query to:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT main.uid FROM main LEFT JOIN email_list ON main.uid =\nemail_list.uid WHERE email_list.email LIKE 'al%' UNION ALL SELECT main.uid\nFROM main LEFT JOIN email_list ON main.uid = email_list.uid WHERE\nmain.first_name like 'al%' UNION ALL SELECT main.uid FROM main LEFT JOIN\nemail_list ON main.uid = email_list.uid WHERE main.last_name like 'al%';\n\nThe the hypothetical optimization above could figure out that the first LEFT\nJOIN could just as easily be a JOIN.\n\nAnd that the other two LEFT JOINs are not required at all due to the DISTINCT\nand the fact that the WHERE clauses on the sub-selects do not reference the\njoined table at all.\n\nIt seems like there are a few moving parts here. And none of these are trivial\nchanges. So, good ideas that might show up in an SQLite release at some point,\nbut it's not realistic to expect these optimizations to be implemented\nquickly. Unless, of course, you can propose a patch and they turn out to be\nsimpler than they look.\n\nRegards, Dan.\n\nDavid Woodhouse\n\n10 years ago\n\nPermalink\n\nPost by David Woodhouse SELECT DISTINCT main.uid FROM main LEFT JOIN\nemail_list ON main.uid = email_list.uid WHERE email_list.email LIKE 'al%'\nSQLite should deduce that since the LIKE implies \"email_list.email IS NOT\nNULL\"\n\n( Digression: SQLite *should* deduce the LIKE implies the IS NOT NULL\ncondition. My *actual* queries all have, for some bizarre historical reason I\nhaven't yet explored,\n\nemail_list.value IS NOT NULL AND email_list.value LIKE 'foo%'\n\nYou'd think that the former condition would end up optimised away, but timings\nshow that it clearly isn't. I wasn't going to bring that up here since I think\nit is so clearly a stupid thing to be putting in our query in the first place.\nBut you just made me do it anyway. )\n\nPost by David Woodhouse the LEFT JOIN is equivalent to a regular JOIN. Which\nwould allow SQLite to reorder the tables and perhaps come up with a more\nefficient query plan. Correct?\n\nIndeed.\n\nAs I said, a glib response to this suggested optimisation in *isolation* might\nbe that the user shouldn't have asked for a LEFT JOIN at all if they didn't\nneed it. But of course when coupled with the other suggested transforms, that\nglib response is a lot less valid.\n\nPost by David Woodhouse The first optimization might be trickier.\n\n...\n\nPost by David Woodhouse I guess queries that have a DISTINCT clause don't have\nthis problem.\n\nRight. I think it only works with DISTINCT, but that's OK.\n\nPost by David Woodhouse SELECT DISTINCT main.uid FROM main LEFT JOIN\nemail_list ON main.uid = email_list.uid WHERE email_list.email LIKE 'al%'\nUNION ALL SELECT main.uid FROM main LEFT JOIN email_list ON main.uid =\nemail_list.uid WHERE main.first_name like 'al%' UNION ALL SELECT main.uid FROM\nmain LEFT JOIN email_list ON main.uid = email_list.uid WHERE main.last_name\nlike 'al%'; The the hypothetical optimization above could figure out that the\nfirst LEFT JOIN could just as easily be a JOIN.\n\nRight.\n\nPost by David Woodhouse And that the other two LEFT JOINs are not required at\nall due to the DISTINCT and the fact that the WHERE clauses on the sub-selects\ndo not reference the joined table at all.\n\nYeah, that's probably true. I'd assumed that we'd do it as part of the \"first\noptimisation\" introducing the UNION but it's probably better handled as a\nseparate transform as you have it here.\n\nPost by David Woodhouse It seems like there are a few moving parts here. And\nnone of these are trivial changes. So, good ideas that might show up in an\nSQLite release at some point, but it's not realistic to expect these\noptimizations to be implemented quickly.\n\nTBH that's all I was really looking for; thanks. I *hate* it when people\nsilently work around limitations in my software without bringing them to my\nattention, and I didn't want to be guilty of doing the same.\n\nI certainly don't expect an instant fix; just knowing that it's on the radar\nis perfectly sufficient. Now I can commit my hackish workaround to rewrite\ncertain special-case queries to optimise the output of the current query\nplanner for them, and still sleep at night :)\n\nThanks.\n\nPost by David Woodhouse Unless, of course, you can propose a patch and they\nturn out to be simpler than they look.\n\nThat would be interesting but realistically it's outside my capacity at the\nmoment. I am already *so* far into shaving this yak that I can barely remember\nwhat I was actually intending to do in the first place :)\n\n\\-- David Woodhouse Open Source Technology Centre\nDavid.Woodhouse-***@public.gmane.org Intel Corporation\n\nContinue reading on narkive:\n\nSearch results for '50% faster than 3.7.17' (Questions and Answers)\n\n222\n\nreplies\n\nIs there a healthy way to fast?\n\nstarted 18 years ago\n\ndiet & fitness\n\n354\n\nreplies\n\nWhich is the fastest browser?\n\nstarted 9 years ago\n\ninternet\n\n11\n\nreplies\n\nWhat are fast foods.?\n\nstarted 15 years ago\n\ndiet & fitness\n\n6\n\nreplies\n\nDo I need to fast tomorrow?\n\nstarted 10 years ago\n\nramadan\n\n17\n\nreplies\n\nChristians, what are the proper ways to fast?\n\nstarted 17 years ago\n\nreligion & spirituality\n\n27 Replies 4390 Views Permalink to this page Disable enhanced parsing\n\nThread Navigation\n\nRichard Hipp 10 years ago\n\njose isaias cabrera 10 years ago\n\nStephen Chrzanowski 10 years ago\n\nt***@public.gmane.org 10 years ago\n\nRichard Hipp 10 years ago\n\nValentin Davydov 10 years ago\n\nRichard Hipp 10 years ago\n\nRoger Binns 10 years ago\n\njose isaias cabrera 10 years ago\n\nSimon Slavin 10 years ago\n\nRoger Binns 10 years ago\n\nStephen Chrzanowski 10 years ago\n\njose isaias cabrera 10 years ago\n\nbig stone 10 years ago\n\nRichard Hipp 10 years ago\n\nbig stone 10 years ago\n\nDonald Shepherd 10 years ago\n\nRichard Hipp 10 years ago\n\nDavid Woodhouse 10 years ago\n\nDavid Woodhouse 10 years ago\n\nDavid Woodhouse 10 years ago\n\nKeith Medcalf 10 years ago\n\nDavid Woodhouse 10 years ago\n\nKeith Medcalf 10 years ago\n\nDavid Woodhouse 10 years ago\n\nDavid Woodhouse 10 years ago\n\nDan Kennedy 10 years ago\n\nDavid Woodhouse 10 years ago\n\nabout - legalese\n\nLoading...\n\n## Welcome to narkive.com\n\n# narkive.com asks for your consent to use your personal data to:\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 62 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
