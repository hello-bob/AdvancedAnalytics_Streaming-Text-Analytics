Why does the\nmarket keep repeating these cycles, instead of supporting the more productive\nblockchain-based innovations that will truly make a difference?\n\nMemecoins are crypto tokens used mostly for humour, born of joining an online\ncommunity that\u2019s in on the joke. You\u2019ve probably heard of Dogecoin, based on\nthe old doge meme featuring images of Shiba Inu dogs. It emerged as a loose\ncommunity online when someone ironically added a cryptocurrency that later had\nsome financial value. This kind of memecoin embodies various facets of\ninternet culture and is mostly harmless.\n\nBut my goal here is not to defend or to diminish memecoins. It\u2019s to point out\nthe absurdity of a regulatory regime in the US that lets meme-only tokens\nthrive \u2014 while crypto companies and blockchain tokens with more productive\nuses face hurdles. We see this everyday while working with entrepreneurs and\nstart-ups. Any mememaker can easily create, launch, and even automatically\nlist tokens. But entrepreneurs trying to build something lasting? They get\nstuck in regulatory purgatory.\n\nThink about it this way: we\u2019d consider it a policy failure if we had a\nsecurities market that incentivised only GameStop meme stocks, but rejected\nthe likes of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Yet current regulations encourage\nplatforms to list memecoins and not other, more useful tokens that make it\npossible for individuals and communities to own internet platforms and\nservices. But the lack of regulatory clarity in the crypto industry means\nplatforms and entrepreneurs fear that the more productive blockchain token\nthey are listing or developing could suddenly be deemed a security.\n\nI call the distinction between these more speculative and productive use cases\nin the crypto industry the \u201ccomputer vs the casino\u201d. One culture (\u201cthe\ncasino\u201d) sees blockchains as a way to launch tokens primarily for trading and\ngambling. The other (\u201cthe computer\u201d) is more interested in blockchains as a\nnew platform for innovation, much like web, social and mobile were before it.\nSuch blockchain-based innovations include decentralising AI and verifying\nwhat\u2019s real against deepfakes.\n\nSo why are we prioritising memes over matter? US securities laws do not\nempower the Securities and Exchange Commission to make merit-based judgments\nabout an investment. Nor is it the SEC\u2019s job to end speculation altogether.\nInstead, its role is to protect investors; to maintain fair, orderly and\nefficient markets; and to facilitate capital formation. The commission is\nfailing across all three objectives when it comes to digital asset markets and\ntokens.\n\nThe primary test the SEC uses to determine whether or not something is a\nsecurity is the 1946 Howey test, which involves assessing a number of factors\n\u2014 including whether there is \u201ca reasonable expectation of profits\u201d due to the\nmanagerial efforts of others. Take, for example, bitcoin and ethereum: while\nboth crypto projects began with the vision of a single person, they evolved\ninto communities of developers with no one entity in control \u2014 so potential\ninvestors don\u2019t have to rely on anyone\u2019s managerial efforts. These\ntechnologies now function like public infrastructure rather than proprietary\nplatforms.\n\nUnfortunately, other entrepreneurs building innovative projects don\u2019t know how\nto qualify for the same regulatory treatment as bitcoin (founded in 2009) and\nethereum (2013-2014). These are the only significant blockchain projects that\nthe SEC has deemed, explicitly or implicitly, not to involve managerial\nefforts. The SEC approach has led to much confusion and uncertainty in the\nindustry. While the Howey test is well reasoned, it is inherently subjective.\nMemecoin projects don\u2019t have developers so there\u2019s no pretence of memecoin\ninvestors relying on the managerial efforts of anyone. Memecoins thus\npropagate, while more innovative projects struggle.\n\nThe answer isn\u2019t less regulation \u2014 it\u2019s better regulation. Specific solutions\ninclude adding well-tailored disclosures to provide regular investors with\nmore information. Another solution is requiring long lock-up periods to\nprevent get-rich-quick schemes. Regulators implemented similar protections\nfollowing the Great Depression, after the excesses of the roaring 1920s and\nstock market crash of 1929. Once those guardrails were in place, we saw an\nunprecedented era of growth and innovation in our markets and economy. It\u2019s\ntime for regulators to learn from the mistakes of the past.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.
