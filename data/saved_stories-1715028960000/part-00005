It said this was\nalways going to be a requirement for players on PC, but due to issues at\nlaunch, linking was made optional for a period.\n\nThe news was immediately met with intense backlash, which resulted in an\ninflux of negative reviews from Helldivers 2 players on Steam. Many asked for\na refund as Helldivers 2 was pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN is\nnot available.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies.\n\nHelldivers 2 - Warbond: Polar Patriots Trailer | PS5 & PC GamesWatch on YouTube\n\nAs a result, Sony has now reversed its plans to make PSN linking a requirement\nfor Helldivers 2 players on Steam.

The May 6 update, which would have required Steam and\nPlayStation Network account linking for new players and for current players\nbeginning May 30, will not be moving forward.\"\n\nSony stated it was \"still learning what is best for PC players\", calling the\nrecent spate of feedback \"invaluable\". It then thanked everyone for their\n\"continued support of Helldivers 2\", before promising to keep us updated on\nfuture plans.\n\nResharing Sony's post, Arrowhead CEO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan\nPilestedt said he was impressed by players' \"willpower... and ability to\ncollaborate\" over the past few days. He then went on to thank Sony for its\ndecision to make PSN linking optional again.\n\n\"We together want to set a new standard for what a live game is, and how\ndevelopers and community can support each other to create the best game\nexperiences,\" Pilestedt concluded.\n\n> Firstly, I am impressed by the willpower of the @helldivers2 community and\n> your ability to collaborate.
