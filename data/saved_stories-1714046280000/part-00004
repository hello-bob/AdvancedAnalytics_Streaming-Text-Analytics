But it comes with a cost,\nto use GPT-3.5 level models you need to pay $10 a month, and double that if\nyou want to use the GPT-4 models. Never mind it\u2019s also macOS only.\n\nChatKit is a BRING-YOUR-OWN-KEY chat interface for over 100 LLMs including the\nmost advanced ones and offline models, most features are available for free,\nwhile a one-time fee ($29 at the moment) grants lifetime access to advanced\nfeatures.\n\nBut ChatKit is beyond just a web app for chatting with AI, it offers a similar\nRaycast AI experience for free, through its desktop app.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works.\n\n## Prompt Templates\n\nChatKit allows you to save reusable prompts, let\u2019s say you want the AI to\nrewrite some text into another tone, the tone is configurable, be it formal,\ncasual, or even sarcastic. You can make a prompt template for this:\n\n    \n    \n    Rewrite the following text into a {{tone|formal,casual,sarcastic}} tone: \"\"\" {{text}} \"\"\" Return the result only, without any other text and quotes.\n\nThe {{tone|formal,casual,sarcastic}} part is a variable, it describes a\ndropdown menu with the options formal, casual, and sarcastic. The {{text}}\npart is another variable, it describes an input field.\n\nSaving this prompt in ChatKit and using it with the slash / command only takes\n30 seconds:\n\n## Prompt Launcher\n\nSo far you can only use the prompt template in ChatKit, that\u2019s where the\ndesktop app comes in. In the desktop app you can set a shortcut for running\nprompt templates anywhere on your computer, like this:\n\nYou can use any shortcut you want, like Ctrl\\ if you want to.\n\nNow you can run prompt templates anywhere on your computer. Just like Raycast,\nit will open a panel to select which prompt you want to run when you press the\nshortcut:\n\nAfter the response is generated, you can copy it by pressing Enter or continue\nthe conversation in an actual chat window by pressing CommandJ.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChatKit is a free alternative to Raycast AI, it offers a similar experience\nwith a few extra steps. It supports many more models, without a subscription\nfee. It\u2019s also cross-platform, you can use it on the web, Windows and macOS.\nThe only downside is that the UX of the prompt launcher is not as optimized as\nRaycast, for example, it doesn\u2019t automatically inject selected text into the\nprompt, you have to copy and paste it manually. It\u2019s also not possible to\n\u201cSummarize the page\u201d when you are opening the prompt launcher on top of a\nbrowser.\n\nThese inconveniences will be fixed in future updates soon, and if you have any\nsuggestions, feel free to send a feedback.\n\n\u00a9 2024 ChatKit Blog.
