Later in California, she worked on Oculus Link and Air Link before\nleaving Oculus in 2022. In early 2024, Watson released CitraVR on Github. This\nletter was written \"as an apology I never sent\" to Carnegie Mellon University\nfor an incident that happened in her final year there in 2014.\n\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nI know this probably comes to you a little late. I\u2019m notorious for putting\nthings off (as you may know by now), but I still feel compelled to send this\nnote. I told the University I was willing to apologize to anyone our actions\nmay have hurt, and I fully intended to do it. I hope that the time, if\nanything, helps give context to my note.\n\nI don\u2019t actually get to know the affected parties to whom this letter is\naddressed, so I\u2019m going to cover my bases and outline exactly what this\napology is about. Last fall, a friend and I spent some time in front of an\nempty booth at the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC). We collected\nresumes from students, and the administration became concerned that, possibly,\nwe may have been mistaken as recruiters for the company of that booth. It was\nthen brought to our attention that, while we may have meant well, this created\ntrouble for students attending the career fair, as well as the staff who were\nin charge of organizing the event. Something we never intended, and something\nwe would of course be very sorry to have caused.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nI now understand that actions and intentions are not really as relevant as\nimpressions, reactions and consequences of what transpired. That said, as long\nas I\u2019m here, I figure some of you wouldn\u2019t mind hearing the full story, as I\nremember it. Not to excuse my actions, but to grant insight into what\nmotivated my friend and I, and why I am truly sorry for what happened.\n\nOn the morning of the incident, I was at the TOC 20 minutes before it opened.\nNormally, I\u2019m not nearly this much of a try-hard, and honestly, suit-wearing\ntry-hards make terrible impressions in tech culture. Yet I was going to risk\nit because, more than anything else in the entire world, I wanted to work at\nOculus VR. As a computer science and drama major with a background in high-\nperformance graphics and systems design, there aren\u2019t a lot of obvious career\npaths for me. Last spring, I listened to a talk given by Oculus researcher\nMichael Abrash, and, as he explained the types of engineers they were looking\nfor, I heard him describe me. To me, Oculus VR seemed like my one shot at\nvalidation, at doing my thing and making new technology happen as a result.\n\nAlso, to be honest, I wasn\u2019t doing very well in my regular-job search. Places\nI\u2019d gotten internship offers from in past years were now turning me down in\nthe last stages of the interviews. I don\u2019t really know why. The ones I asked\ngave vague answers about my just not being a good fit. Maybe I sounded like a\njerk? Honestly, if anything in this apology seems like the kind of personality\nflaw that would prevent employment, please let me know. All I can say is that\nI was starting to get scared and bitter. I built up this meeting with Oculus\nat the TOC to be my one shot at making things right. I told myself again and\nagain that I was going to do whatever it took to get myself noticed \u2013 for\nwhich I am, in retrospect, very, very sorry.\n\nOf course, when the doors finally open and I make my way to the Oculus booth,\nit\u2019s totally empty. The signs aren\u2019t up, the complimentary water bottles sit\nuntouched in the middle of the table. To say this was a disappointment would\nbe a gross understatement. For maybe an hour \u2013 well into my next class \u2013 I\njust paced the TOC, hoping Oculus would show up. Of course, as we now know,\nother than one small blip later in the day, the Oculus VR booth would remain\nunstaffed.\n\nFinally, I gave up and headed to my next class. I was crushed. CMU has a\nstrong alumni footing in most tech companies you\u2019d want to work for, some\npipeline for resumes outside of events like these. But not Oculus. Oculus is\ntoo new for me to really know anyone who could push a resume along. I knew\nthat if I could just get my foot in the door they\u2019d be interested, right? I\nwas desperate to talk to someone, anyone with connections. Honestly, I might\nhave loitered around even longer if I hadn\u2019t figured my best chance for\ngetting in touch with Oculus was going to be sitting next to me in my next\nclass.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nIn theory, having a friend like George would be the perfect solution to a\nproblem like mine. He\u2019s like a minor celebrity in the tech world, and has all\nsorts of connections in silicon valley. He even knows Palmer Luckey, the guy\nwho founded Oculus VR. But if you honestly thought this was going to be my\nsalvation, you don\u2019t know George very well.\n\n\u201cWhat, I\u2019m just going to email Palmer and be like \u2018yo, I know this girl, she\u2019s\ntalented, you should hire her\u2019? No, of course I\u2019m not going to do that. You\u2019re\nnot exactly John Carmack. What do you think I\u2019m supposed to do?\u201d George speaks\nwith a strong, high-pitched Jersey accent, which I think amplifies the amused\ncondescension in everything he says.\n\n\u201cI...I dunno, tell him to leave my resume under a door somewhere? I just need\nit to get to a recruiter, not the CEO.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, if we\u2019re all ever in the same place, I\u2019ll get us together some night,\nand the three of us will go drinking. But I\u2019m not just going to send him an\nemail out of the blue vouching for you.\u201d\n\nYou know what? Fair enough. Having a direct line of communication to the\ncompany\u2019s founder isn\u2019t really a great way to get a job through honorable\nmeans. It was agonizing to be this close, though. I just needed an in.\nSomehow, I was going to get noticed.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nIt\u2019s at this point where people start blaming George for what transpired. I\ntry not to get too insulted by this. \u201cElite Hacker Gains Privileged Access to\nUniversity Gym, Exposes Vulnerabilities in Career Fair Security\u201d makes for a\nbetter head canon than my soppy rant about unemployment, certainly, and\ndoesn\u2019t require nearly this level of exposition. In truth, it was me,\nembittered with my futility and disappointment, who convinced George to come\nwith me to visit the Oculus booth after class. Some of our classmates would\nlater claim they heard George say to me as we were leaving, \u201cwanna go to the\nOculus Booth and impersonate some recruiters?\u201d, but I maintain that this does\nnot make sense and is not true.\n\nWhen we arrived at the TOC this second time, the event was in full swing. The\nonce-empty booths were now being mobbed by kids in suits, and so I hoped\nOculus would be the same. Of course, when we arrived, there was no one there\nbecause they were never there because no one showed up. We wandered around the\nevent for a couple minutes before finally planting in one of the TOC\u2019s few\nfree spaces \u2013 in front of the Oculus VR booth \u2013 to regroup.\n\nThat\u2019s when I saw it: a pile of papers sitting at the back of the table I\nhadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cHey, look at this!\u201d I called to George.\n\n\u201cYeah, so?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing this pile before.\u201d\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\n\u201cNo, I saw it from before. It\u2019s probably the resumes of all the kids that\nwanted to see Oculus...You think the recruiters will come back to pick them\nup?\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly? They\u2019re just gonna get thrown out at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nDamn. The only thing worse than not being in the pipeline is not knowing\nyou\u2019re not in the pipeline. Honestly, when I looked at those resumes, I felt a\nlot of sympathy for those other kids. Like me, they probably were desperate to\ntalk to Oculus, and didn\u2019t have another way to do so. They\u2019d probably been as\ncrushed as I was when they saw the empty booth. And now their resumes wouldn\u2019t\neven be seen! I wished I knew something I could do for them -- for us.\n\nIt was at that moment one of the suited kids approached the booth, shook\nGeorge\u2019s hand and introduced himself. After a 20-second monologue about his\neducation, research and career aspirations, he gave us a resume. It was\nsurreal.\n\nGeorge was blindsided. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t actually work for Oculus VR. If you\nwant, I can put this resume on the table behind me. That\u2019s what a lot of\nstudents have been doing.\u201d\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nIt was THE most awkward moment. Suddenly, all of suit kid\u2019s enthusiasm\nvanished, and was he just staring back at us, unsure of what he\u2019d done wrong.\n\n\u201cIf I put my resume on the table...it gets to Oculus?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m honestly not\nsure.\u201d\n\nHesitantly, he placed his resume on the pile and left. \u201cThat was fucking\ntragic\u201d I mumbled only moments before I was greeted by a smiling suit girl of\nmy own. In a tiny, tiny voice I could barely make out, she asked if we worked\nfor Oculus. This time, I cut her off as quickly as possible, giving the same\nexplanation George did. Like the last guy, she was confused. \u201cBut recruiters\npick up these resumes at the end?\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, probably not? But hey, don\u2019t take my word for it.\u201d\n\nAfter some hesitation, she just shuffled away, deciding not to part with her\nresume.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nGeorge and I broke the weirdness with some laughter. It was amusing, honestly.\nBut more than amusing, it was refreshing, too. I\u2019d spent the entire morning\nworrying about what I would look like to these recruiters, how they\u2019d judge\nme. Now, I was that recruiter, and it all seemed so low-key. The fear - my\nfear \u2013 I was seeing on student\u2019s faces seemed so unnecessary, their posturing\nso...counterproductive. It was like I could see right through it, look past\ntheir spiel and know with deadly accuracy who was worth spending time on. I\nwas seeing behind the curtain, and it felt great.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make it sound like what happened next was motivated by this\nindulgence or my desire to \u201cplay God.\u201d Honestly, at no point did we make any\nplans for impersonation.\n\nI simply said to George, \u201cHey. \u2018We\u2019 know people at Oculus, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\n\u201cIf these resumes are just going into the trash anyway, maybe we can do\nsomething. Collect them and send them off to Palmer or someone he recommends.\u201d\n\nGeorge claims that he never agreed to this, and I guess it\u2019s possible I made\nit all up. But in any case, he went ahead with the plan. We had more students\ncome up and ask if we worked for Oculus. Each time, we would say no, and\ndirect them to the pile of resumes on the table. This time, however, we also\nsaid we would try and forward them, because we knew people at Oculus who might\nbe able to help. These students, while still confused, seemed a lot happier\nthan the first ones. They handed us resumes, shook our hands, and wandered\nback into the bowels of the career fair.\n\nNow I can imagine what it must have looked like: two geeky-looking types\nstanding in front of an otherwise empty booth, shaking hands, saying words,\ncollecting resumes. I can understand, then, why the line of students may have\nstarted to form in front of us. It\u2019s worth pointing out, though, that it\u2019s\nreally a stretch to say we looked like recruiters. The signs and water bottles\nstill sat on the table, no one stood behind the table the way recruiters\nusually do, and we weren\u2019t even wearing name tags (at some point George picked\nup a sticker that said \u201cFull-Time Positions\u201d and stuck it on his chest, but\nthat was hardly an attempt at impersonation \u2013 he\u2019s just an idiot). There was\nliterally no Oculus insignia anywhere \u2013 the only corporate logos on our\npersons were George\u2019s Google sweatshirt and my Palantir book-bag. It\u2019s been\nsaid that a line formed because students were being misled, but if you ask me,\nthey didn\u2019t see us as recruiters. Like me, they were desperate for any contact\nat all with this company, and wanted exactly what we had to offer: any chance\nat all at being in touch with Oculus VR.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m trying to make excuses for myself.\nStudent Life informed us later that, even if our impersonation wasn\u2019t\nparticularly believable, we should be held accountable nonetheless for\n\u201cwasting student time\u201d, an offense that, while not actually against the rules,\nis an interesting idea for a rule and might be fun to cite now and again. This\nmay also be one of the points where intent and consequence didn\u2019t align,\nbecause honestly, I didn\u2019t think student time was being wasted. We gave those\nstudents a handshake and about 20 seconds of monologue time before telling\neach one, without exception, that we did not work for Oculus VR. Each time it\nwas explained that we planned to forward resumes, as well as any notes they\nthought would be helpful to recruiting (I thought this was a nice touch, so as\nnot to squander their chance at having a real human interaction).\n\nMost students seemed to understand and still give us their resumes, sometimes\nhesitantly asking one of us what we might know about the company and its\ntrajectory. I didn\u2019t have much to say other than the research I\u2019d gathered by\ngoogling Oculus VR on my phone. George, on the other hand, would happily\nlaunch into his own dystopian vision of VR\u2019s future, where headsets have\nbecome mandatory for human interaction and images are projected onto your\nretina, paving the way for bionic eyes and, more than likely, the singularity.\nIf anyone at that point thought that George was a real recruiter, I truly am\nbeing sincere when I say that I am really honestly sorry.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a lot of fun. Yet, as nice as it was to play the\npart of the resume collector students had been so desperate to find, something\ndidn\u2019t feel right. We\u2019d never intended to create such a scene. As nice as it\nmight have been to stick to our principals and collect as many resumes as\npossible from the students who needed it, the attention we were getting was\nquickly becoming too much, and in 10 minutes it was all over. I turned to\nGeorge and saw he was thinking the same thing. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here\u201d, he\nsaid. We picked up the resumes from the table, pushed through the crowd and\nleft the career fair, as clandestinely as we\u2019d arrived.\n\nThis is where a lot of people say I got in trouble. Remember what I said about\nputting things off? Well, I initially had trouble making good on that promise\nto get those resumes to Oculus. I asked George how we should go about sending\nthem, and initially, he said we could get the contact info for the recruiting\noffice and fax them. Later in the day, however, he was expressing doubts.\nFirst he claimed we hadn\u2019t met anyone he thought was qualified to work at\nOculus (a judgment he had no business making, because we never really took a\nhard look at any resumes). Finally, he admitted he was nervous about talking\nto Palmer. He had a lot of respect for the guy, and it would be \u201cawkward\u201d to\nhave to explain the situation to him. Ok, fine. Without an immediate plan B, I\ndecided to put it off and let it sit until I got back from my onsite with\nNvidia four days later.\n\nBy then, I\u2019m now told, alarm bells had started to go off in the bowels of the\nTOC administration. Still unaware of any of this, on my return, I flagged down\nan SCS professor I trusted and asked him what the best thing to do with the\nresumes would be. He said I could give them to him, and he would figure out\nwhat to do with them.\n\nAgain, I have this unfortunate habit of putting things off. It took me two\ndays to come back with the resumes, during which time, an email was sent out\nto both students and non-students, warning that a pair of unidentified,\nunaffiliated suspects had entered the TOC, impersonated recruiters, and later\nleft with a stack of student information. While this email was addressed to a\nlarge percentage of the student body, alumni network and industry partners, it\nwas not actually addressed to me. George and I eventually heard about the\nemail through a friend, and this was the first time I realized that other\nparties were not only aware of our actions, but had been alarmed by them such\nthat it had become necessary to inform the university and the industry of the\nthreat our actions posed. It was at this point that I finally handed the\nresumes off to our professor, made sure they had been seen by the concerned\nparties at the TOC, and figured that was the end of it.\n\nAs we all know now, this was only to be the beginning of the actions I was to\nfeel very, very sorry to have caused. Apparently, the return of the resumes\nand the promise from our professor that we were undergrads and not terrorists\nprompted a rather large investigation, internal and external, to determine our\nidentities. I heard the Pittsburgh PD got involved. I heard CMU\u2019s detectives\nwere put on the case to track us down. I, for one, didn\u2019t know that CMU had\ndetectives! What do they do all day? George dug up a case where the detectives\ngot called to investigate a student who had brought three girls into his dorm\nroom to \u201chelp assemble furniture\u201d. At the end of the day, I like to think the\nCMU detectives appreciated having a real live mystery to solve. I\u2019m not going\nto apologize for that.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nAt this point, we would have happily given ourselves up and prevented the\nultimate scale of this investigation had it not been for two things:\n\nFirst, something about George: George is very, very, very sensitive about the\nsubject of cops. Between getting sued by Sony, going to court for some nasty\nmarijuana possession charges, and just general, anti authoritarian personality\ntraits, George doesn\u2019t have a very good image of cops. In fact, I would go so\nfar as to say he fears them. On the first day we heard there was an\ninvestigation, I got an email essay from George on what one should or should\nnot say in an interrogation room, and he was making preliminary conversations\nwith his team of lawyers. You need to understand, it isn\u2019t enough to tell\nGeorge that nothing bad is going to happen. For George, the American criminal\njustice system will take your tiniest infraction and use it as a chance to\nscrew you.\n\nSecond, I guess I just sorta figured the detectives would find us. Honestly,\nwe weren\u2019t exactly trying to hide ourselves, and in a school of only 400 or\nso, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to question a couple of SCS students and discover our\nidentities. Besides, George is one of the most famous people in the entire\nuniversity. Once we learned they had a photo of us, it seemed like only a\nmatter of time before someone figured us out. So we waited. We put off doing\nanything about it.\n\nAs the days went by, however, the knowledge that he was being searched for\nbegan to take a toll on George. He wasn\u2019t attending class, and would instead\nsend me emails planning our strategy or the next session with his lawyers.\nWhen I finally saw him again, he looked shaken. \u201cI can\u2019t do this much longer.\nI think I need to get my lawyers together and turn myself in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell wait a second. You still know the CEO of Oculus. Couldn\u2019t you get in\ntouch with him, and have him tell the TOC folk he doesn\u2019t care? I mean, he\nprobably doesn\u2019t, right?\u201d\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nGeorge thought about it. \u201cNo. Like I said, I really don\u2019t want to bother him\nabout something this silly. Like, I\u2019m really going to ask the founder of a\ncompany to bail me out of what basically amounts to a dumb college prank?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else are we going to do?\u201d\n\nEventually, George gave in and sent Palmer Luckey an email. To our surprise,\nhe responded almost immediately \u2013 he\u2019d heard of the incident, and thought it\nwas hilarious. At the end, he just said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, and we\u2019re not going to find out, because I\u2019m not emailing him\nagain.\u201d\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear from Palmer for a really long time. Maybe he puts things off,\ntoo. In any case, this was too long for George. Only a few days later, he\ncalled me at 6am, panic-stricken. \u201cI can\u2019t take this any longer. The\npressure\u2019s too much. I\u2019m going to turn myself in\u201d.\n\nI wasn\u2019t there to see George come forward. According to George, he walked into\nCIT, greeted the TOC\u2019s organizers pleasantly, and listened with patience and\nmaturity as he was brutally chastised for all the damage we had caused.\nAccording to the administration, George was rude and combative, his coming\nforward serving only to make relations worse. I heard all this from our\nprofessor, who encouraged me to come forward as well, but to maybe try a\nlittle less \u201csass\".\n\nAnd so, after only a few days of putting things off this time, I drafted my\nfirst apology letter, outing myself and expressing regret for any damage my\nactions had caused the administration. I sent it to my professor, who\nforwarded it to the appropriate people. I\u2019d hoped it would provide these\npeople with closure, giving them information they needed to understand our\nactions and motivations, and to realize that we were in no way a threat to\nstudents or to the TOC. I was sincere when I said I felt bad about the\nreactions we had evoked, and now wanted to volunteer this information in the\nhopes of helping everyone finally rest easy.\n\nOf course, as George and I had yet to understand, there would be a lot more\nrepentance required from us before the TOC\u2019s organizers could once again feel\nsafe and secure.\n\nA few days later, I received an email with the subject line: \u201cInterview\u201d.\nNothing out of the ordinary for CS majors in the fall semester, though I\ncouldn\u2019t figure out who this interview was with. Finally, when the last lines\nspecified the location of our interview \u2013 Craig St, between Quiznos and Razzy\nFresh \u2013 it clicked: that\u2019s where the police station is \u2013 this was going to be\nan \u201cinterview\u201d with the police!\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nAs you might be able to guess, George was having none of that. \u201cThere is no\nway I am talking to a cop! Their whole goal is to hang you with your own\ntestimony! Goddammit, I really didn\u2019t want to hire lawyers for this!\u201d Our\nprofessor, who has legal experience himself, agreed. Cops were bad news, and\nany interaction with cops meant having expensive lawyers. So I replied to the\npolice, saying we were refusing to speak with any cops, which is how we got\ndirected to the offices of Student Life for our disciplinary hearing.\n\nBy now, George was really starting to lose it. He\u2019d stopped attending classes\n6 weeks ago, and was making plans to drop out once again. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking\nroad trips to Ohio and listening to Hardcore History podcasts,\u201d he told me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s making life worthwhile.\" He said that while his plans to drop\nout were motivated by the investigation, I shouldn\u2019t see it as my fault. \u201cIf\nI\u2019d seen this happen to someone else from afar, you bet I would\u2019ve gotten as\nfar away from this nightmare university as possible.\u201d\n\nThe steps for Student Life\u2019s disciplinary investigation would be as follows:\n\nStep 1: they would collect testimony from me, George, and any students who\nwere willing to come forward and describe their experience with us.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nStep 2: they would bring me and George in for a meeting, where they would lay\nout the findings of the investigation and what rules in the CMU Student\nConduct Handbook we were deemed to have violated.\n\nStep 3: once all of us could agree on what the violations had been, they would\ndole out a punishment.\n\nAs their investigation proceeded, George and I would go over the CMU Student\nConduct Handbook, trying to figure out what our violations would be. There are\nsome really interesting ones, like disabling or altering a classmate\u2019s life\nsupport device, or the violation for reverse-engineering and exploiting third\nparty software. At the end of the day, however, we struggled to find a crime\nwe\u2019d committed during this incident. Sure, someone who hadn\u2019t done an\ninvestigation might say \u2018Impersonation of Another Person\u2019, but that seemed\nweak, seeing as we\u2019d made it clear who we were to everyone we met, and even if\nwe hadn\u2019t, we weren\u2019t exactly trying to \u201cimpersonate\u201d anyone in particular.\n\nFinally, we got to the final violation: \u201cConduct Unbecoming of a Carnegie\nMellon Student\u201d. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d I asked George.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a catch-all, in case they want to tack something on. I don\u2019t think\nthey can just hit us with that. That seems too vague. I mean, you have to\nactually violate something to be in violation, right?\u201d\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nOf course, we now understand how misguided we were in that moment. When asking\nwhy nothing we were being accused of actually fell in line with a real rule,\nwe were informed that \u201cWe [CMU] didn\u2019t think we needed one because we didn\u2019t\nthink anyone would ever do such a thing\u201d, a perspective that resonated with\nGeorge\u2019s and my own backgrounds in computer security and systems software.\n\nStudent Life agreed that, while at first glance the incident had looked like\nimpersonation, it wouldn\u2019t meet the criteria for \u2018Impersonation of Another\nPerson\u2019, since none of the students they\u2019d interviewed had actually admitted\nthey had felt misled. In fact, Student Life and I ended up agreeing on a lot\nof things: for the most part, students didn\u2019t feel hurt, nor did Oculus VR,\nwho had since gotten in touch with the University and given a statement.\n\nHowever, Student Life also believed that we still ought to be punished for\ncommitting \u201cConduct Unbecoming of a Carnegie Mellon student\u201d for the following\nreasons:\n\n1\\. Wasting student time\n\n2\\. Taking far too long to return the resumes and rectify the situation\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\n3\\. Causing a reaction by the TOC that ultimately embarrassed them, exposing\nhow easily impersonations could occur and creating a \u201cblight\u201d on their name.\n\nI explained I was confused about how we could be guilty of standing in front\nof a booth and collecting the resumes students gave us with full information,\nespecially since the fact that is wasn\u2019t prevented by policy was the reason\nthe TOC felt \u201cblighted\u201d in the first place. George, who\u2019d recently listened to\nthe Hardcore History podcast about WWI, compared the situation to the\nassassination of Archduke Ferdinand, and kept insisting he wouldn\u2019t be\nsatisfied until he understood \u201cwho we\u2019re paying reparations to\u201d. I understand\nthat this took our interviewers by surprise and was, in their words,\n\u201cmemorable\u201d. I\u2019m not going to apologize for that.\n\nEventually, after a far longer process, we reached an agreement: 20 hours of\ncommunity service for Conduct Unbecoming, a reflective essay and perhaps an\napology. This was, of course, directed solely at me, since George had by now\ndropped out of school and moved on to California to pursue greater, weirder\nthings.\n\nOr at least, so I thought.\n\nThree weeks after my sentencing, he was back, having scheduled yet another\nmeeting with Student Life. \u201cNo more WWI, right?\u201d I pleaded.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d he said with an alarming grin. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading up on Genghis Khan\nthis time.\u201d\n\nI was sure that this meeting would spell death for me and yet, a few days\nlater, I got another email from Student Life. All charges against me were\ndropped. To this day, I have no idea what he did.\n\nNow all I would have to do was send them an apology. This wouldn\u2019t be a\nrequirement, the email said, but since we had claimed to express real regret,\nit seemed only fair that we compose a genuine apology for the affected\nparties.\n\nAgain, I am not told who these affected parties are, but by process of\nelimination, my guess would be organizers of the TOC, the ones who had been\n\u201cblighted\u201d by our actions. I can understand their perspective: perhaps my\nactions and the resultant reactions had forever damaged relations with Oculus,\nas we\u2019d exposed \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d that would create distrust in their event.\nIt would, of course, make sense that such individuals would feel threatened\nand insecure in absence of an apology.\n\nAllow me to put those minds at ease. Earlier this month, I did it \u2013 I finally\ngot my foot in the door with Oculus VR! I met an engineer named Rob at a\nparty, and it turned out he worked there, and we struck up a conversation. I\nmanaged to pass my resume along to him and, as luck would have it, they were\ndoing a new employee review the very next day! I got put on the pile, they\nlooked at my resume and, just as I had imagined it, they, too, thought I would\nbe a good fit. Less than one week after submitting my application, I had an\noffer in hand.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nA few days later, I was approached by the real Oculus recruiter. They\u2019d heard\nabout my new offer, and of course knew all about the business at the TOC last\nfall. As luck would have it, they were going to be at the EOC two weeks later.\nThey wanted to know if I, now an official Oculus employee, was interested in\nworking at the event as an official recruiter. Honestly, I was elated. It felt\ngreat to be welcomed as a member of the company so quickly, and to actually\nprovide a service for students who had been so disappointed the semester\nearlier. We joked that, as the senior Oculus recruiter, I was going to have to\nshow them what to do \u2013 \u201chelp us figure out which of these students are legit.\u201d\n\nAfter months and months of contemplating unemployment, of having to explain\nmyself to dozens and dozens of accusatory faces, I was finally on the other\nside. I watched neurotic try-hards like me and George line up in front of my\nbooth, hand me their resumes, and give me some nervous spiel about why I,\nOculus VR, should hire them. Some were good enough that all they needed to\ngive me was their resume. Usually, the ones that had big, fancy monologues\nwere trying too hard, and it took me only a glance at their work experiences\nand some quick questions to see why. If there\u2019s one lesson I\u2019ve learned from\nthis whole experience, it\u2019s to not try so damn hard to get what you want. If\nyou\u2019re bright-eyed, genuine and deserving, the world will eventually turn the\nway it needs to ensure things work out in the end.\n\nSo in the end, representatives of the TOC, I hope you don\u2019t judge me or my new\ncompany too harshly. Last fall, neither of us really knew what we were doing.\nWe were young, nervous, desperate to make a good impression. Somehow, we both\nended up getting misunderstood. By the spring, though, we think we have it\nfigured out, and look forward to working with you in TOC\u2019s and EOC\u2019s to come.\nAt least, I certainly do.\n\nOf course, if you want it from the horse\u2019s mouth, I encourage you to send me\nyour concerns directly, and I\u2019ll be sure to forward them to my guy Palmer\nASAP. I hear we\u2019re all getting together for drinks soon.\n\nAmanda Watson returning to the EOC at Carnegie Mellon University after \"the\nincident\" as an official representative of Oculus.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nGuest Article\n\n### Analyzing Apple Vision Pro As An Accessibility Engineer\n\n, & Rebecca Rosenberg\n\n20 February\n\n### Weekly Newsletter\n\nGet a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nGuest Article\n\n### How To Design Mixed Reality Experiences Like A Magician\n\n, & Laura Mingail\n\n17 December 2023\n\nGuest Article\n\n### What New Findings Tell Us About Valve's Deckard Headset\n\n, & Brad Lynch\n\n23 June 2022\n\n## Member Takes\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\n## Weekly Newsletter\n\nSign up to get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news, straight\nto your inbox.\n\n## More Guest Article\n\n20 February\n\n### Analyzing Apple Vision Pro As An Accessibility Engineer\n\n17 December 2023\n\n### How To Design Mixed Reality Experiences Like A Magician\n\n23 June 2022\n\n### What New Findings Tell Us About Valve's Deckard Headset\n\n## Latest Articles\n\nHeadsets & Tech\n\n### Vision Pro 2 Reportedly Set For Late 2026 As Apple Struggling To Make\nCheaper Headset First\n\n, & David Heaney\n\nToday\n\nImmersive Video\n\n### Insta360 X4 Is A Handheld 8K 360\u00b0 Camera For $500\n\n, & David Heaney\n\nToday\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Subside Demo Delivers Breathtaking Swimming Visuals On SteamVR\n\n, & Don Hopper\n\n26 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Alien: Rogue Incursion Announced For Quest 3, PlayStation VR2, And PC VR\n\n, & David Heaney\n\n26 April\n\nGlasses & AR Tech\n\n### Meta's Head Of AR Glasses Hardware Claims They're As Mindblowing As The\nOriginal Oculus Rift\n\n, & David Heaney\n\n26 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### 3v3 VR Brawler 'Brazen Blaze' Begins New Open Beta On Quest & Steam\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n26 April\n\nIndustry News\n\n### Zuckerberg: First-Party Quests Will Continue To Be The Most Popular\nHeadsets\n\n, & David Heaney\n\n25 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Passport Venice: Walkabout Mini Golf Transports You To Italy\n\n, & Ian Hamilton\n\n25 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Contractors Showdown Brings VR's Largest Battle Royale Map To Quest &\nSteam Today\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n25 April\n\nAR/MR Gaming\n\n### Astra Is A 'Deeply Personal' Mixed Reality Adventure Across The Cosmos\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n25 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Nope Challenge Gamifies Facing Your Phobias In VR On Quest\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n25 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Arcade Paradise VR Enters Your Living Room On Quest\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n25 April\n\nHeadsets & Tech\n\n### Vision Pro 2 Reportedly Set For Late 2026 As Apple Struggling To Make\nCheaper Headset First\n\n, & David Heaney\n\nToday\n\nImmersive Video\n\n### Insta360 X4 Is A Handheld 8K 360\u00b0 Camera For $500\n\n, & David Heaney\n\nToday\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Subside Demo Delivers Breathtaking Swimming Visuals On SteamVR\n\n, & Don Hopper\n\n26 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Alien: Rogue Incursion Announced For Quest 3, PlayStation VR2, And PC VR\n\n, & David Heaney\n\n26 April\n\nGlasses & AR Tech\n\n### Meta's Head Of AR Glasses Hardware Claims They're As Mindblowing As The\nOriginal Oculus Rift\n\n, & David Heaney\n\n26 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### 3v3 VR Brawler 'Brazen Blaze' Begins New Open Beta On Quest & Steam\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n26 April\n\nIndustry News\n\n### Zuckerberg: First-Party Quests Will Continue To Be The Most Popular\nHeadsets\n\n, & David Heaney\n\n25 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Passport Venice: Walkabout Mini Golf Transports You To Italy\n\n, & Ian Hamilton\n\n25 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Contractors Showdown Brings VR's Largest Battle Royale Map To Quest &\nSteam Today\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n25 April\n\nAR/MR Gaming\n\n### Astra Is A 'Deeply Personal' Mixed Reality Adventure Across The Cosmos\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n25 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Nope Challenge Gamifies Facing Your Phobias In VR On Quest\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n25 April\n\nVR Gaming\n\n### Arcade Paradise VR Enters Your Living Room On Quest\n\n, & Henry Stockdale\n\n25 April\n\nSee More\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\n  * X\n  * YouTube\n  * Facebook\n\n  * About Us\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Code of Ethics\n  * DMCA\n  * Advertise With Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 UploadVR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
