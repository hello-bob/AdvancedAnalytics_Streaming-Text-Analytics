It is hard. It takes passion. It takes purpose. It takes\ntireless and unselfish dedication. It takes perseverance. And it takes luck.\nBut mostly, it takes hope and belief: hope that the work can make a difference\nand belief that it will.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Doug Lowenstein, JDRF volunteer since the diagnosis of his daughter, Emma,\nin April 2001\n\nNinety-five percent of all drugs that start human clinical trials are never\napproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This is a story of\nhow one drug beat those overwhelming odds. It is a story of success and\nfailure, multiple near-death experiences, and luck. But mostly it is also a\nstory of relentless and ceaseless perseverance by a small cadre of scientists\nwho never wavered in their certainty about the drug\u2019s transformative potential\nto save lives.\n\nThe drug\u2019s generic name is teplizumab. Rather than just treating the symptoms\nof the burdensome and life-threatening autoimmune disease, type 1 diabetes\n(T1D), as every therapy since the discovery of insulin 100 years earlier had\ndone, teplizumab is the first therapy that treats the underlying causes of the\ndisease. After teplizumab finally crossed the finish line in November 2022,\nmore than 30 years after its creation, one participant called it \u201cthe little\nmolecule that could.\u201d Another long-time observer simply said, \u201cit went through\ncurves, bumps, hills, and brick walls. It\u2019s amazing given all this that it\nfinally broke through.\u201d\n\nThis is how it happened.\n\n### Chapter 1: The Scientists\n\nJeff Bluestone was born in 1953 and grew up in New Jersey, the son of a dry\ncleaner. \u201cI thought I was going to focus on virology, but my dad\u2019s friend had\na cancer scare, and I met one of his doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering\nCancer Center (MSK) in New York who was an immunologist,\u201d he recalled. This\nchance encounter convinced Bluestone to make a career pivot from virology to\nimmunology and move from Rutgers University to the Sloan Kettering division of\nWeill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Science for his Ph.D. It was the\nfirst step in a journey that would lead Bluestone to being recognized today as\none of the world\u2019s leading immunologists.\n\nBluestone started his career at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in\nBethesda, MD, where he worked on kidney transplants and, by 1987, he was at\nthe University of Chicago\u2019s Ben May Department for Cancer Research. It was\nthere that he met Kevan Herold.\n\nKevan Herold grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. \u201cScience was always my\nthing. It is what I always loved. It was the easy part of school.\u201d So, it was\nno surprise that in 1974 he enrolled in Penn State University\u2019s accelerated\nmedical degree program. But a few weeks after arriving in University Park, his\nlife changed.\n\n\u201cI went to a fraternity open house, and I started feeling really sick there.\nIt wasn\u2019t like I drank tons of beer or anything like that. I just really\ndidn\u2019t feel well. In the next couple of weeks, I would get up at night and\ndrink and go to the bathroom and so on. And one day, I was riding the campus\nshuttle and thinking, \u2018I just can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019\u201d He went to the Campus\nHealth Service and, hours later, ended up in the Emergency Room.\n\nHerold had T1D, a chronic disease where the body\u2019s own immune cells mistakenly\ndestroy the insulin-producing beta cells that play a critical role in\nsustaining life. The diagnosis came out of the blue. At the time Herold was\ndiagnosed, T1D put patients on a path to blindness, kidney failure, nerve\ndamage, and heart disease. Patients faced scores of daily decisions related to\nhow much insulin to self-administer: too much or too little could have life-\nthreatening consequences. Most of those diagnosed with T1D, including Herold,\nhave never heard of the disease before being diagnosed. Even today, 85% of\nthose diagnosed with T1D have no family history. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about\nthis. Now, all of a sudden, it\u2019s like you\u2019re drinking out of the fire hose,\u201d\nHerold recalled about those early weeks. But instead of overwhelming him,\nHerold said, \u201call of this stuff became, frankly, intellectually very\ninteresting.\u201d He knew then that he wanted to become a medical researcher.\n\nHerold went on to complete his medical degree at Jefferson Medical College in\nPhiladelphia and soon landed at the University of Chicago to work with Frank\nFitch, a renowned immunologist. In the late 1980s, Fitch introduced Herold to\nBluestone. Over the next 30 years, Bluestone and Herold would collaborate,\ncommiserate, and ceaselessly pursue the goal of using a new class of drug,\ncalled monoclonal antibodies, to prevent T1D.\n\n### Chapter 2: Drinking the Kool-Aid\n\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are highly precise tools that target specific\nmolecules that are linked to specific diseases. In fact, many of today\u2019s\nimmune therapies that have slowed or cured various cancers and treated some\nautoimmune diseases are mAbs. When Herold and Bluestone connected in Chicago,\nthe only FDA-approved mAb was called Orthoclone OKT3. It was used to prevent\nkidney transplant rejection. OKT3 was made by the Johnson & Johnson (J&J)\nsubsidiary Ortho Pharmaceuticals. It was an anti-CD3 mAb. CD3 is a protein\nthat is on the surface of a subset of immune cells called T cells. When a\nforeign organ is transplanted, CD3 T cells destroy the new organ. OKT3 was a\ngroundbreaking drug. It blocks CD3, and the CD3 T cells disappear, preventing\norgan rejection.\n\nThere was just one problem: OKT3 caused serious side effects in patients and\nsimply wasn\u2019t a long-term solution to the problem. Bluestone saw that as a\nchallenge. Working with a team of colleagues, he decided to try to \u201cfix\u201d OKT3.\nIn 1986, the team successfully made a new anti-CD3 that worked in mice the\nsame as OKT3 worked in humans but without the side effects. By 1992, Linda\nJolliffe and Robert Zivin, scientists in the research arm of J&J, working with\nanother company called Celltech, built on the mouse model Bluestone\u2019s team\ncreated, and developed a modified (mutated) version of OKT3 that successfully\nsuppressed organ rejection with minimal side effects. Its lab name was\nhOKT3gamma1 (Ala-Ala). Eventually, it would simply be known as teplizumab.\n\nWhile this work was happening, Bluestone and Herold, as well as a French team,\nled by Lucienne Chatenoud and the late Jean-Francois Bach, were studying the\nuse of anti-CD3s in autoimmune conditions. \u201cOur lab had a big interest in T1D\nsince the beginning of the 1980s,\u201d Chatenoud said. \u201cIt was an interesting\ntopic for immunologists because it had recently been discovered to be an\nautoimmune disease and it appeared that the T cells were the major effectors\nof beta cell destruction as they were in transplant rejection.\u201d\n\nBluestone and Herold theorized that the same signaling as occurred in organ\nrejection occurred in T1D; only in T1D, the CD3 was mistakenly signaling T\ncells to destroy insulin-producing beta cells. They reasoned that if an anti-\nCD3 could block the progression of the disease before symptoms by neutralizing\nthe attack, it could prevent T1D. In the early 1990s, they decided to test\nthis bold and innovative theory.\n\nIn 1992, they published a study of mice with T1D that showed that modified\nanti-CD3 mAbs, which did not induce side effects, could prevent the disease.\nThis exciting news was followed two years later with a report from a French\nresearch team headed by Lucienne Chatenoud and Jean-Francois Bach that\nextended the Bluestone-Herold findings using an even more robust mouse model\nshowing the modified anti-CD3 could even reverse diabetes if given right at\ndiagnosis.\n\nThe findings cemented both teams\u2019 determination to use a human anti-CD3 mAb to\ntreat T1D.\n\n\u201cIt was in the nineties when we drank the Kool-Aid,\u201d said Bluestone of anti-\nCD3\u2019s potential to prevent T1D. \u201cWe were convinced because of the early human\nstudies in kidney transplant and the mouse studies in T1D, that it could be\nthe game changer.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, as the scientists\u2019 enthusiasm about anti-CD3s and teplizumab\nbuilt, J&J\u2019s wilted. The company decided it did not want to be in the mAb\nbusiness, so it opted not to develop teplizumab and sold the modified OKT3 to\na company called Centocor. But shortly thereafter, Centocor was acquired by\nJ&J and once again, J&J killed teplizumab development.\n\nThus, within a few years, teplizumab had two near-death experiences, both\nexecuted at the hands of J&J.\n\nBut Bluestone and Herold were not turning back. Herold\u2019s personal connection\nto T1D provided an obvious reason to persevere. For Bluestone, his passion\nevolved and grew as he met families and people living with T1D. \u201cIn a lot of\nsituations with T1D, the first time you meet one of these parents with a kid\nwith the disease you immediately appreciate that what you are doing is a lot\nmore than research. These are real people that are suffering terribly and it\u2019s\noften kids that are bearing the brunt of the challenges of managing the\ndisease. And so, it was at that point in the early 1990s that I switched a big\nchunk of my research with teplizumab to T1D.\u201d\n\nThe organization that facilitated many of Bluestone\u2019s early interactions with\nthe T1D community was a nonprofit patient advocacy group named the Juvenile\nDiabetes Research Foundation, now simply known as JDRF.\n\n### Chapter 3: JDRF\n\nIn 1970, a Philadelphia Mom named Lee Ducat was devastated when her nine-year-\nold son was diagnosed with T1D. According to a JDRF history of its founding,\nDucat said in the subsequent days she cried every night realizing her son\nwould have to live with the disease the rest of his life. \u201cI told myself, \u2018You\nbetter do something, Ducat.\u2019\u201d And after a doctor told her that with enough\nmoney, scientists could cure the disease, Lee put away her tissues. \u201cI said,\n\u2018Well, if money is all you need, we\u2019ll get the money to cure diabetes.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Carol and Erwin Lurie were seeking out families in their\ncommunity who had T1D after their ten-year-old son was diagnosed at a summer\ncamp. Soon, Ducat and the Luries found each other and JDRF was born.\n\nSince its founding, JDRF has become the largest private funder of T1D research\nin the world, with affiliates in five countries and chapters throughout the\nU.S. In the early years, JDRF was intensively focused on funding basic\nresearch to advance a cure for the disease. (Coincidentally, Herold\u2019s family\nknew Lee Ducat. When he returned to Philadelphia after his diagnosis and was\nsearching for an opportunity to work in T1D research, it was Ducat that helped\npoint him in the right direction.)\n\nBut by the late 1990s, JDRF was supporting Bluestone and Herold\u2019s anti-CD3\nresearch, and over the next decade, it would play a critical role as a\ncontinuing research funder, an investor, an FDA regulatory resource, and a\npolicy advocate to advance teplizumab to the doorstep of the FDA. In fact,\nHerold has received more than 15 research grants from JDRF, many of them\nfocused on anti-CD3 studies and trials.\n\nHerold actually spent a brief stint as JDRF\u2019s scientific director before\nmoving to Columbia University in 1998; by 2000, Bluestone had moved to the\nUniversity of California in San Francisco (UCSF). But they remained passionate\nbelievers in teplizumab, determined to demonstrate its efficacy. \u201cThe first\nthing I did when I got to Columbia was to figure out how to do a trial with\nteplizumab. I had about $30,000 from JDRF.\u201d Herold went to Columbia\u2018s\nbusinessperson and said, \u201c\u2018I am going to do this,\u2019 and she just laughed at me.\n\u2018That\u2019s not money, that\u2019s pocket change,\u2019\u201d she said. But Herold managed to\nscrape additional funding together through a grant from the NIH; and he and\nBluestone launched a small human trial testing teplizumab in 12 recently\ndiagnosed patients with T1D.\n\nIn 2002, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine published the first\nevidence that teplizumab could be the drug that could delay the progression of\nT1D in humans. The 2002 paper was followed in 2005 by a trial Herold and\nBluestone ran in 42 patients that further solidified the evidence that\nteplizumab could delay T1D. Importantly, this trial also established that\nteplizumab generated minimal side effects.\n\nWith these exciting findings, the first human evidence emerged that teplizumab\ncould be the drug that could change the course of diabetes without the need\nfor chronic immune suppression\u2014the administering of a lifetime of additional,\noften dangerous, drugs to prevent the immune system from overreacting.\n\nEqually exciting, Herman Waldmann at Oxford University had created yet another\nT1D anti-CD3 candidate called otelixizumab, and he, Chatenoud, and Bart\nKeymeulen reported in 2005 that this molecule showed great promise in\npreserving beta cell function, similar to the findings of Herold and\nBluestone. The only cautionary note was the finding that moderate flu-like\nsymptoms, reminiscent of the symptoms of Epstein-Barr viral mononucleosis,\nwere experienced by some drug recipients.\n\nHerold\u2019s 2002 and 2005 studies and the otelixizumab study fueled tremendous\nexcitement in the T1D research and patient community. More importantly, the\npromising results ignited interest in these mAbs among major drugmakers.\n\n### Chapter 4: The Race Is On\n\nIn 2009, a small company called Tolerx aligned with the large global company\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to test otelixizumab in T1D patients. It was a phase III\ntrial\u2014the final, largest, and most costly stage of drug testing before seeking\nFDA approval. It would test the drug in hundreds, not dozens, of newly\ndiagnosed patients with T1D. They named the trial DEFEND.\n\nAnother player soon jumped in. MacroGenics was formed to develop immune-based\ntherapeutics for autoimmune diseases and cancer. Scott Koenig, one of its\nfounders, previously worked at MedImmune, where he met Bluestone, who was on\nthe company\u2019s Scientific Advisory Board. By now, Bluestone had moved from\nChicago to the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), and, in 2005,\nhe received a visit from Koenig.\n\n\u201cI went out to California, and he told me the history of the molecule and it\nfit into what we were doing in developing molecules for autoimmune diseases,\u201d\nKoenig recalled. \u201cThe fact that it already had some clinical data (from the\n2002 and 2005 human trials) was an attractive way to accelerate our company.\nSo, in June 2005, we did the deal to acquire teplizumab from Jeff.\u201d\n\nMacroGenics promptly went to work on a phase III trial called PROT\u00c9G\u00c9, which\nwould test teplizumab in hundreds, not dozens, of newly diagnosed patients\nwith T1D. It was a prelude to applying to FDA for approval of teplizumab as a\ndrug that would preserve beta cell function in newly diagnosed patients,\nstaving off the onset of full insulin dependence. Eli Lilly came aboard as a\npartner to help fund the trial and manufacture the drug. JDRF supported the\ntrial with a relatively modest grant.\n\nSuddenly, four companies were in the T1D anti-CD3 race: MacroGenics/Lilly,\nGSK/Tolerx. Optimism was high. If both trials went as expected, two anti-CD3\ndrugs would be on their way to the FDA for approval and the first immune\ntherapy for T1D would soon be available to patients.\n\nBut that is not how things worked out.\n\n### Chapter 5: Abandoned Again\n\nIn a matter of a few years, both trials would be deemed as failures\u2014though for\ndifferent reasons. The PROT\u00c9G\u00c9 trial \u201cfailed\u201d for two reasons. First, the FDA\nand the European Medical Agency (EMA), the continental equivalent to the FDA,\nhad required MacroGenics to combine two separate success metrics, called\n\u201cendpoints\u201d in clinical trial parlance. Neither of the required FDA/EMA\nendpoints had been used in the earlier Herold-Bluestone trials. Second, it\nturned out that many trial participants enrolled outside the United States may\nhave had different forms of T1D that inadvertently biased the results. In any\nevent, when the results were revealed, teplizumab failed to meet the mandated\nendpoints, and the trial and the entire MacroGenics teplizumab program shut\ndown. Lilly immediately walked away from teplizumab. The PROT\u00c9G\u00c9 results\nbecame teplizumab\u2019s third near-death experience.\n\nAnd right behind this discouraging development came the fourth one. The\nGSK/Tolerx trial failed as well. Because Keymeulin\u2019s smaller 2005 trial had\nshown some risk of activation of Epstein-Barr Syndrome which can cause\ninfectious mononucleosis, the sponsors decided to lower the dose given to\npatients in its phase III trial. In 2011, it was reported the drug did not\nimpact T1D progression because the actual dose used was simply too low to have\nan effect.\n\nThe results were also a blow to JDRF. The reality was that without an\ninexhaustible research budget JDRF could not afford to keep funneling grant\nmoney to a drug that was perceived as a lost cause. JDRF\u2019s Chief Scientific\nOfficer at the time, Richard Insel, recalled \u201ca meeting with MacroGenics,\nJeff, and Kevan, and the question was: should JDRF take this on completely?\nBut there was no way that we were going to be able to pay for it in its\nentirety. By then, we had lost multi-millions of dollars on the MacroGenics\nand Tolerx trials.\u201d\n\nMacroGenics maintained ownership of teplizumab but moved on to other drug\ncandidates. Koenig continued to advocate for the drug and he was in touch\nregularly with Bluestone and Herold. \u201cWe would talk constantly,\u201d he recalled.\n\u201cWe would go to meetings together and separately. I spent a lot of time on the\nroad looking for a home for this. We came close with a few companies, but we\njust couldn\u2019t get it over the finish line.\u201d\n\nBluestone pushed Koenig to give him an opportunity to sell teplizumab to\nanother company. Koenig agreed and Bluestone went to work. But it was tough\nsledding. \u201cPeople thought it was not going to work,\u201d said Bluestone. \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t raise money; we couldn\u2019t start a company.\u201d\n\nThat should have been enough to end the story. The golden age of T1D anti-CD3s\nappeared to have come and gone.\n\n### Chapter 6: Glimmers of Hope\n\nIt probably would have died there except he and Herold were not buying the\nnegative data from the PROT\u00c9G\u00c9 trial. Herold and Bluestone believed that the\ndata from their own 2002 and 2005 trials, as well as from other trials with\nteplizumab in the mid-2000s, proved the drug\u2019s positive effects on newly\ndiagnosed people with T1D. \u201cI knew we had all these positive results from the\nclinical trials I was doing. I was a little surprised that there was an\nabsolute \u2018zero\u2019 on PROT\u00c9G\u00c9 I have to admit. I remember being really shocked\nand I couldn\u2019t figure that out.\u201d\n\nBut soon enough, they did. As they dived deeply into the PROT\u00c9G\u00c9 data, they\nsaw what they believed all along. Patients receiving teplizumab produced more\ninsulin than those receiving the placebo as measured by the breakdown product\nof insulin, called C-peptide. This is exactly what had excited them and\nChatenoud, in all their earlier trials. But the FDA had not agreed to use\nC-peptide as the trial\u2019s endpoint, and, in so doing, it had obscured the\ndrug\u2019s efficacy. The chronically understated Herold recalled, \u201cWhen I saw the\nC-peptide data from the trial I thought, \u2018Well, yeah, of course it worked.'\u201d\n\nStill, though, hope does not pay the cost of clinical work. Industry had lost\ninterest; JDRF lacked resources to fund a new trial by itself. And while the\nNIH\u2019s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\nhad continued to provide funding to Herold for T1D research evaluating\nteplizumab in newly diagnosed patients, there was no guarantee it would have\nthe will or the resources to do so in the future.\n\nThe Special Diabetes Program (SDP) would help change that.\n\n### Chapter 7: Strange Bedfellows\n\n\u201cIt was the summer of 1997 and JDRF had just established our D.C. office a few\nyears earlier,\u201d recalled Bill Schmidt, JDRF\u2019s first head of Government\nRelations. \u201cWe were making a lot of noise in Congress and the Clinton\nAdministration about the underfunding at NIH of T1D research, and diabetes in\ngeneral. It was pretty concerning. And then Speaker Gingrich really developed\na strong interest in diabetes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWoody (Robert Wood) Johnson came in to see me about the importance of JDRF,\u201d\nGingrich said in a recent interview. \u201cHe convinced me T1D was a pervasive and\nlife-altering disease and we should have a more dramatic funding program than\nwe had.\u201d This set the stage for Erskine. (Ironically, Johnson, currently the\nowner of the New York Jets, was the great grandson of one of the three\nbrothers that founded Johnson & Johnson, the very company that helped discover\nteplizumab and abandoned it way back in 1994.)\n\n\u201cErskine\u201d was Erskine Bowles, President Clinton\u2019s Chief of Staff who had a\nchild (eventually two) with T1D. While Gingrich and Bowles had little in\ncommon politically, the former Speaker recalled that \u201cwe had a very good\nworking relationship, and Erskine brought the idea of a T1D funding program to\nme.\u201d\n\nThat same year, there was a pitched battle over the federal budget.\nEventually, President Clinton and Republicans, led by Gingrich, reached a form\nof a grand bargain that went by the prosaic name of The Balanced Budget Act of\n1997. The bill retained a package of tax hikes favored by Democrats and\ncoupled these with reduced spending on Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nTucked deep inside the hundreds of pages of legislative language, Gingrich and\nBowles had slipped into the bill a five-line section called The Special\nDiabetes Program, or SDP, providing $30 million annually for five years to\nfund T1D research through NIH.\n\nIn 2000, Congress increased annual funding for SDP to $100 million. But just\ntwo years later, SDP was set to expire. Unless it was renewed, this\nincreasingly important T1D funding stream would abruptly end. What ensued was\na high-wire, gut-wrenching battle that on multiple occasions seemed destined\nto end with the death of the program. JDRF would not go down without swinging.\nIt waged a full-court, high-profile campaign involving families, celebrities\n(JDRF Chair Mary Tyler Moore who had T1D, actor Kevin Kline who had a son with\nT1D), and dozens of major corporate CEOs who had T1D in their families.\n\nThe effort culminated in the wee hours of the morning on November 20 when the\nlast holdout, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, a senior member of the Senate\nBudget Committee, capitulated under a barrage of JDRF-generated calls to his\noffice from Oklahomans with T1D, and pressure from numerous colleagues\nsupporting SDP\u2019s renewal who surrounded him on the Senate floor. At 1 am on\nNovember 20, 2000, SDP was renewed for $150 million per year for five years.\n\nNone of those involved in SDP\u2019s creation or renewal imagined that SDP would\neventually provide some of the key funding for the clinical trial that would\neventually transform the world of T1D science and treatment.\n\n### Chapter 8: The Game Changer\n\nJay Skyler was a well-known and accomplished T1D researcher with a strong\ncommitment to T1D prevention, and he was a long-time ally of Bluestone and\nHerold in T1D prevention research. In fact, Skyler was the lead investigator\nin what had been the largest T1D prevention trial ever conducted\u2014the NIH\u2019s\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\n2000-2005 Diabetes Prevention Trial (DPT), which sought to determine if\nadministering oral insulin to nondiabetic relatives at risk of getting T1D\nwould delay disease onset. The results did not pan out.\n\nBy 2010, Skyler was the head of the NIDDK\u2019s TrialNet program which had grown\nout of the DPT trial he led. Herold and Bluestone proposed to Skyler that\nTrialNet fund a teplizumab trial in those at risk of T1D\u2014patients who had\nblood tests that showed they would eventually get clinical, symptomatic,\ninsulin-dependent T1D. In other words, instead of testing the drug in newly\ndiagnosed patients who were already symptomatic, as all the prior studies had\ndone, why not try it in patients before they even reach that point? Skyler\nreadily agreed.\n\nFittingly, Herold, by now at Yale University School of Medicine, was the lead,\nor primary investigator, overseeing the trial.\n\nThings got off to a promising start when FDA agreed to allow TrialNet to use\nthe safety data from all the earlier teplizumab trials instead of requiring\nnew studies to prove safety, a requirement that would have taken years longer\nand would have set the bar too high to even try. And most importantly, FDA\nagreed to a much more relevant endpoint than it had mandated for PROT\u00c9G\u00c9.\n\u201cThere was a single endpoint: do you get diabetes or don\u2019t you get diabetes?\u201d\nsaid Bluestone. While this was great news, it also meant the trial would take\nyears to complete to allow time to compare whether and how long those\nreceiving teplizumab progressed to T1D compared to those not receiving the\ndrug (placebo arm).\n\nBut the FDA\u2019s flexibility didn\u2019t clear the field entirely. In fact, the\ntrial\u2019s advocates ran into a buzzsaw of skeptics at NIDDK and some diabetes\nspecialists in the community. Voices said it was premature, they wondered\nabout the drug\u2019s safety, and they were concerned the trial would take too long\nand cost too much. Judy Fradkin, who served at the time as Director of NIDDK\u2019s\nDivision of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolic Diseases, made the call to\nproceed; in July 2011, the first trial to delay onset of T1D in at-risk\npatients got underway. It was called simply TN-10, or TrialNet 10.\n\nMacroGenics, thanks to Koenig, also played a key role in getting TN-10 off the\nground. It provided some of the remaining supply of teplizumab for use in the\ntrial (Lilly had stopped making it but MacroGenics retained leftover\ninventory). It insisted that the trial be \u201crandomized\u201d meaning that some\nparticipants would receive teplizumab and others would not. \u201cWe would not have\nproceeded unless there was agreement about the [randomized] study design,\u201d\nsaid Koenig. \u201cIf that had not occurred, there would have not been an approved\ndrug today.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, this would not be the last word on trial design. The\nsubsequent debate would indeed almost kill TN-10.\n\nAfter the TN-10 launch, it was immediately clear that one of the major\nchallenges would be enrolling subjects. This was because unlike conducting a\ntrial of people who already had a T1D diagnosis as every other study had done,\nTN-10 needed to identify at-risk participants that had blood tests that had\nshown the disease had started and likely would eventually have clinical T1D.\n\nIn essence, TrialNet had to persuade people who were not actually sick to\nparticipate in a medical trial with some risks. That was hard enough. But\nbecause all participants had to come to a trial site for a 14-consecutive-day\ninfusion, it placed an added set of practical burdens on recruitment. Asking\nkids to miss two weeks of school, their parents to miss time at work, and, in\nsome cases, to travel long distances, was a heavy lift.\n\n### Chapter 9: The Patients\n\nMadison Buff\u2019s older brother was diagnosed with T1D around 2013 when he was\n15. Madi and her two siblings were screened through TrialNet to see if any of\nthem were on the path to developing T1D. \u201cI was the only one that came back\nmultiple autoantibody positive (meaning she would eventually progress to\nT1D),\u201d said Madi. \u201cAnd just hearing that I had the autoantibodies was scary,\u201d\nrecalled Madi. By her junior year in high school, her test results suggested\nthe disease might be starting to progress.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when they told me about the TN-10 trial. We were hesitant about it\nbecause my mother would have to take two weeks off from work and me from\nschool, and it was a six-hour drive to Nashville where we would get the\ninfusion and my mom didn\u2019t like to drive. But we decided even if it didn\u2019t\nhelp me, it would help the research world; and, eventually, it would help us,\nbecause we knew T1D ran in our family.\u201d So, they went off to one of the trial\nsites in Nashville where Madi would receive teplizumab or the placebo for the\ntwo-week infusion.\n\nJust outside of Rochester, NY, Cory Wirt, a pediatrician, and her husband were\nroutinely screening their daughter Claire for T1D from age 2. Both parents had\nT1D in their families, so they were quite familiar with the disease. In fact,\nthe family was even involved in the local JDRF chapter. All went well with\nClaire until her test at age four came back autoantibody positive. \u201cIn 2015,\nwe got a call from our local endocrinologist who said, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s this guy\nat Yale, Kevan Herold, and he has an interesting trial going and I wonder if\nyou\u2019d like to talk to him?\u2019\u201d And she did. Soon thereafter, Claire enrolled in\nthe TN-10 trial and headed to New Haven where a TN-10 trial site was running\nunder Herold\u2019s supervision.\n\nStill, TN-10 recruitment moved glacially. The goal was to enroll a total of\n160 people, 80 in the placebo group and 80 in the drug arm. In time, it became\nclear that TrialNet would take years to hit its enrollment target. \u201cI remember\nsome people felt we should just pull the plug. It was just costing too much\nand taking too long,\u201d said Skyler.\n\nFradkin and the team ultimately made the tough call to cut the trial down in\nhalf to 80 subjects evenly divided between the two arms. Chatenoud, who served\nas an advisor on the TrialNet Steering Committee, recalls being at a meeting\nwhen the trial size was reduced and flying home to Paris from Washington, D.C.\nfeeling \u201cdiscouraged.\u201d She said she felt \u201cif you decrease the number, you\nincrease the challenge to show that the difference between the two groups (the\none receiving the drug and the one receiving the placebo) is stark\n[statistically meaningful], and when they went down with the numbers a lot of\npeople in the community felt it was not going to work.\u201d It meant that the\ntrial would have to hit the clinical trial equivalent of a grand slam home run\nby showing the drug\u2019s effectiveness far beyond the levels needed in the other\npositive teplizumab trials.\n\nThe second threat to TN-10 came when some pushed to abandon the placebo arm\nentirely to accelerate the trial and reduce cost. Once again, Fradkin made the\nfinal call. \u201cThere was some talk about getting rid of the placebo arm which to\nme would have been a non-starter,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we had gotten rid of the\nplacebo arm there would have been no point in doing the trial, it would have\nbeen totally unconvincing.\u201d Skyler added: \u201cWhat Judy did, when recruitment was\ntough, and there was a vote to get rid of the placebo group, Judy said \u2018No.\u2019\nHad she not, we would not be talking today. She stood firm and was the savior\nof the trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the hardest clinical trial I have ever been involved with,\u201d recalled\nFradkin. But teplizumab had survived two failed industry trials, the\ndisappearance of four drug companies, and a touch and go debate over whether\nto do a prevention trial at NIH, and somehow, it was back on the clock more\nthan 20 years after its creation back in the early 1990s.\n\nBy now, Madi and Claire had completed their TN-10 infusions and waited. Did\nthey or did they not get the drug?\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t getting any symptoms,\u201d recalled Madi. \u201cWe heard some people were\ngetting rashes and we were looking every day at my arms to see if we had any\nrashes and nothing was ever coming up. And it was just disheartening.\u201d\n\nCory Wirt had heard something similar. \u201cEvery day we\u2019d walk back and forth to\nthe infusion center, we\u2019d get back to the room, and I would literally sit and\ncry. Tears of joy, tears of sadness because you don\u2019t know. I still get\nemotional thinking about it. I think on day six or seven there was a faint\nrash that was fleeting and you just want to hang onto that. Maybe that was it.\nBut you don\u2019t know, you\u2019re grasping.\u201d\n\n### Chapter 10: The New Kids on the Block\n\nAshleigh Palmer and Francisco Leon met through LinkedIn. Palmer had\nestablished a reputation as a drug company turnaround and startup specialist;\nLeon had built an extensive career as an immunologist. \u201cWe decided to start a\ndisease prevention company,\u201d Palmer recalled, and by 2017, they formed a\ncompany with three assets: two gastrointestinal autoimmunity drugs (licensed\nfrom J&J subsidiary Janssen) and a vaccine against the Coxsackie B virus. The\nCoxsackie B virus is believed to be a common trigger of T1D. They named their\nnew company Provention Bio, \u201cpro\u201d for being proactive at disease interception,\nand \u201cvention\u201d for disease prevention.\n\nSoon after Provention was formed with the goal of preventing T1D and other\nautoimmune diseases, it benefited from two major strokes of luck. Palmer was\ncontacted by a financial firm called MDB Capital because it had heard of his\nturnaround expertise and wanted him to join a Board of a company in which it\nhad invested. Palmer declined but mentioned his new company and MDB expressed\ninterest in hearing more. In January 2017, Palmer and Leon met with MDB during\nthe annual JP Morgan Conference, a major gathering of biotech companies,\nscientists, investors, and others looking for the \u201cnext\u201d major therapy. \u201cI\nwill never forget the meeting,\u201d said Leon. \u201cWe pitched them and they said they\ncould get our company funded around the vaccine asset, which surprised me\nbecause it was our riskiest asset with the longest lead time (to\nprofitability).\u201d\n\nThe MDB meeting was lucky enough, but the second stroke of luck came at 7 am\nthe following morning when the pair were at what Leon called a \u201cspeed dating\u201d\nsession where attendees could stop by and quickly check out companies to see\nif anything was of interest. \u201cOne guy was at the table, and he said he ran a\npipette company,\u201d remember Leon.\n\nThe pipette man was Mark Fischer-Colbrie who had a son with T1D; and he just\nhappened to be a volunteer leader at JDRF. \u201cI was standing at a table with\nFrancisco and Ashleigh, and I always wear my JDRF pin and always ask people if\nthey are working on anything related to autoimmunity. And they told me they\nhad just started a company and had a vaccine against Coxsackie B virus and I\nknew that it is strongly implicated in T1D. So, I immediately connected them\nto the JDRF T1D venture philanthropy fund.\u201d\n\nThe JDRF T1D Fund was itself brand-new. It was the brainchild of John Brady, a\nformer Chair of the JDRF International Board. Brady was desperately looking to\nexpand JDRF\u2019s core funding from galas and walks to something that could\nsupercharge JDRF revenue so it could make bigger bets on more ambitious,\npotential game-changing therapies. Brady recruited a bright, dynamic executive\nnamed Sean Doherty, at the time the General Counsel for the giant private\nequity firm Bain Capital, who had a son with T1D, to design and launch the\ninnovative venture philanthropy initiative.\n\nFive months after the chance meeting with Fischer-Colbrie, and just a few\nmonths after the T1D Fund was launched, it made an investment in Provention\nBio. J&J Innovation soon followed, and MDB Capital completed the Series A\nround. In June 2017, Provention\u2019s first capital infusion closed with $28.4\nmillion. As part of the deal, Provention committed to becoming a public\ncompany within 18 months.\n\nThe JDRF T1D Fund imprimatur was a game changer. Leon said that without it,\n\u201cthe Provention we know would not have existed. Their commitment was important\nto make us \u2018real.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmazingly, at the time the financing closed, teplizumab was not on the radar\nof any principals. The JDRF investment was all predicated on the Coxsackie B\nvaccine. That would soon change, and it changed because of yet another\nappearance by Lady Luck.\n\n### Chapter 11: TN-10 Earthquake\n\nEleanor (Leni) Ramos started her career in academia as an immunologist, but\neventually decided she wanted to get involved in hands-on drug development.\nShe became a kidney transplant physician and joined Bristol Myers Squibb\n(BMS). While at BMS she met Leon around 2000. She soon moved on to join\nBluestone at the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN), which was supporting an early\nteplizumab trial led by, surprise, Kevan Herold. Over the years, she and Leon\nwould occasionally catch up.\n\nIn 2017, after a career break, Ramos was about to take a new job when Leon\ncalled and asked for her input on the assets Provention was putting together.\n\u201cWhen she told me she was about to take a new job, I suggested she join us at\nProvention as Chief Medical Officer,\u201d Leon said. Ramos was intrigued.\n\u201cAshleigh and Francisco were coming out to LA the next week, and I agreed to\nmeet in a relaxed setting at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX),\u201d she\nremembered. \u201cBut my plane was delayed and delayed.\u201d It looked like the\nvagaries of air travel would prevent Ramos from making the meeting. But Palmer\nand Leon convinced her to fly to LAX for even a short meeting. The \u201crelaxed\u201d\nmeeting finally took place over an hour with the trio sitting on the floor of\na crowded baggage claim at United\u2019s Terminal 7. Ramos signed on as CMO. The\ntrio didn\u2019t know it at the time, but it would turn out to be a very\nserendipitous hire.\n\nProvention Bio\u2019s now also included the founders, Ramos, and Andrew Drechsler.\nDrechsler had joined the company as Chief Financial Officer a few months\nearlier. An experienced drug industry financial executive, he also has three\nchildren with T1D. The team realized that to complete a successful public\nstock offering (Initial Public Offering, or IPO) it would be prudent to find\nother drug assets. \u201cOne of the tenets of Provention Bio, and a lesson I\nlearned from turnaround work, is that a company with limited assets would be\ndead\u201d if those few assets didn\u2019t succeed, said Palmer. So, the small team\nstarted reaching out to their networks to see if it could find other promising\nautoimmune therapeutic candidates to acquire.\n\nOne of Ramos\u2019 first calls was to an old colleague she had worked with 15 years\nearlier: Jeff Bluestone. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 and he asked if I\nremembered the T1D drug we worked on at ITN. Honestly, from 2002 when I left\nITN, to when I called him in 2017, I had not followed the diabetes space. Jeff\nsaid that MacroGenics had put it on the shelf because the pivotal phase III\nPROT\u00c9G\u00c9 trial failed but we should look at it.\u201d\n\nRamos reported back to the team that teplizumab was available and soon the\nprincipals met with Bluestone. Bluestone gave them a mixed view of their other\nassets and then, in his words, \u201cI blurted out that I had a better drug than\nall the ones in their pipeline.\u201d\n\nThe Provention team vigorously debated the pros and cons of teplizumab but\neventually agreed to try to acquire it from MacroGenics. Finalizing the deal\nwas complicated because so many other companies, including Lilly and Celltech\nhad acquired limited royalty rights to teplizumab over its history. Eventually\nthe deal closed. And Scott Koenig, still CEO at MacroGenics and still a\nbeliever even though his company was no longer developing teplizumab, played a\nkey role. \u201cWhen we were at the 11th hour, Scott stepped in and made some\ncompromises to make sure the deal got over the finish line even though he knew\nthere might never be a profit made from the drug,\u201d Bluestone said.\n\nArmed now with teplizumab and the other assets, Provention Bio, or PRVB as its\nticker symbol said, went public in July 2018 at $4 per share for a total raise\nof $64 million. Once they had teplizumab, the company moved to set up the\nPROTECT trial, another trial of newly diagnosed T1D patients to see if they\nwould experience an extended period of insulin production before becoming\nsymptomatic. \u201cWe planned to repeat the failed PROT\u00c9G\u00c9 study with lessons\nlearned,\u201d Palmer said. But they wanted to move fast for one major reason.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned about the TN-10 study,\u201d Drechsler remembered. \u201cIt was a\nwild card. And what if we start enrolling 300 newly diagnosed patients and the\nTN-10 study reads out negatively? How do you deal with that? How do you\nposition it to Wall Street? More importantly, how do you position it with the\nclinical investigators we needed to run the trial?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were prepared for TN-10 to fail,\u201d said Leon. \u201cAnd the reason was it was an\nunderpowered study,\u201d exactly the concern Chatenoud expressed when the\nenrollment was cut in half. \u201cThere might not be enough patients to show\nefficacy,\u201d said Leon. \u201cAnd then, of course, everything changed.\u201d\n\nWhat changed is that TN-10 turned out to be a stunning success despite its\nrelatively small size.\n\nIn June 2019, Herold stood up at the annual ADA Scientific Sessions in San\nFrancisco and announced that TN-10 had produced astonishing data. Those that\nreceived teplizumab in the trial took a median of two years longer to progress\nto full symptomatic T1D (follow up work has since shown that the median is now\ncloser to three years and that some trial participants have gone a decade and\nremain asymptomatic). In the New England Journal of Medicine paper published\nmonths later, the conclusion simply read: \u201cTeplizumab delayed progression to\nclinical T1D in high-risk participants.\u201d Put with a bit more dramatic flair,\nT1D had its first ever potential disease-modifying immune therapy, the first\nmajor advance in T1D therapy since insulin a century earlier.\n\nBluestone was in the audience at ADA when Herold revealed the TN-10 results.\n\u201cIt was the first time I have ever been at an academic talk where the audience\ngave the speaker a standing ovation.\u201d\n\nOnly days before Herold unveiled the results, Buff and Wirt learned that they\nhad indeed received teplizumab, not the placebo.\n\n### Chapter 12: The Race to the FDA\n\nWithout the meeting between Palmer, Leon, and Ramos on the floor of LAX\nbaggage claim, teplizumab likely would never have found a home at Provention\nBio. But it didn\u2019t take long after TN-10 for the company to realize it needed\nto switch gears immediately. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this, but it was now about\ntaking advantage of an opportunity and we began switching our priority from\nthe PROTECT study to the prospect of being able to file for an application for\napproval of teplizumab to treat at-risk patients to delay the onset of full\ninsulin dependence,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cWhat did we have to lose? It was all\nupside.\u201d In January 2021, Provention filed a Biologics License Application\n(BLA) seeking FDA approval of teplizumab. The FDA set a decision on whether to\napprove it six months later.\n\nBy the time Provention filed, it had already been working to prepare for\napproval of the drug. One area of focus was manufacturing. Since Lilly had\nlong ago stopped making teplizumab, Provention had to replicate the mAb in a\nmodern manufacturing facility to distribute after approval. It chose to\nconduct a study to prove to the FDA that the new version was comparable to the\nversion of the drug made by Lilly and that was used in the TN-10 trial. When\nit completed the study, Provention felt confident in the results and shared\nthem with FDA. Unfortunately, FDA wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\nNonetheless, FDA continued with the teplizumab review. One of the most\nconsequential steps in any drug approval process is an Advisory Committee\n(AdComm), an expert panel that hears from the drug applicant, the FDA, and the\npublic before voting whether to recommend that the FDA approve or disapprove\nthe drug for commercial use. A positive vote can speed a drug to approval, and\na negative one can be fatal.\n\nThe teplizumab AdComm took place in late May 2021. The AdComm lasted the\nentire day. Ramos and Herold led the Provention presentation, making the case\nthat the drug was safe and effective. The FDA staff then made a strong case\nfor approval, also expressing their view that the drug was safe and effective.\nBut three of the four adult endocrinologists on the panel, those with the most\nexperience dealing with diabetes patients, sharply pressed both the agency and\nProvention. They raised concerns about the potential long-term safety of the\ndrug. They wondered whether the data was sufficiently robust, they wondered if\nthe trial was too small to draw conclusions, and whether a larger trial should\nbe required with more patients.\n\nPalmer said the AdComm was \u201cfrustrating and disappointing\u201d and \u201cfor the very\nfirst time I had an \u2018Oh shit\u2019 moment whereby this could be the end of the run\nof luck, this could be the squashing of the momentum.\u201d Jason Hoitt,\nProvention\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer, simply thought, \u201cOh my God, these\npeople may not actually support the first disease-modifying treatment to\naddress the underlying cause of the disease.\u201d\n\nBut the afternoon presentations from those with the most at stake, those\ntouched by T1D, began to regain the positive momentum. Fifteen of sixteen\npublic witnesses offered their own powerful stories: people with T1D, doctors\nwith T1D, academic researchers, patient advocates, all stressing how critical\nit would be to them and others to have two years without T1D even if they knew\nfull insulin dependence with all its risks and burden was eventually\ninevitable.\n\nClaire Wirt and Madi Buff, two of the patients who had enrolled in the trial,\nuncertain about their chances of getting the drug, uncertain if it would work,\nbut willing to go to tremendous inconvenience and risk to be part of\nscientific experiment, were among these witnesses.\n\n\u201cDuring the past five years, I have been able to attend prom, graduate high\nschool, I\u2019ve moved out on my own, and I am set to graduate college in three-\nand-one-half years,\u201d Madi said. \u201cI am forever thankful to the team that helped\nmake this such a positive experience for me and have given me the opportunity\nto lead a normal, young adult life without constant worrying about my blood-\nsugar levels and subsequent hospital visits.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt 9 years old, I had four positive autoantibodies,\u201d Wirt said. \u201cMy parents\nand I were bracing for the inevitable. Then we got a phone call that changed\neverything for me. Now, I\u2019m coming up on 66 months without T1D, five and a\nhalf years of my childhood free of this disease and from the burden that comes\nwith it. I recently celebrated my fifteenth birthday without having to count\ncarbs or administer insulin. I don\u2019t have to track my blood sugar throughout\nthe day or find the right balance for it when I go to dance or ski with my\nfriends. My thoughts are not occupied with the stresses of going hypoglycemic\n[low blood sugar] or inadvertently giving myself a lethal dose of insulin. My\nlife doesn\u2019t have to exist in a state of careful calculation and continuous\nmonitoring because teplizumab has given me the freedom and autonomy for five\nand a half years.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly eight hours, it was time for the AdComm to vote. The drama was\nintense. Those watching around the world on their phones or computers endured\nseveral agonizing minutes of silence. Then the mic crackled, and FDA\u2019s Latoya\nBonner announced, \u201cFor the record, the vote is 10 yeses, 7 noes.\u201d\n\nA win. But it was closer than ideal. Given the closeness of the vote, and the\nopposition of the adult diabetes experts on the panel, would that swing the\nFDA brass to a more skeptical view and lead to an overruling of the AdComm?\n\n### Chapter 13: The Stretch Run\n\nProvention had no time to relax. The close AdComm vote was concerning. But an\neven bigger concern was that the comparability bugaboo could cause FDA to\ndecline approval. That is exactly what happened. On July 6, 2021, the FDA told\nthe company it had not proven that its version of the drug would work\ncomparably to the Lilly version, and Provention\u2019s application for approval of\nteplizumab was rejected.\n\nThe management team was not ready to give in. It believed it could eventually\nsatisfy FDA on comparability, but it also knew the mountain ahead was steep\nand there was no guarantee of turning FDA around. Palmer called it \u201ca gnarly\nand worrisome challenge.\u201d Ramos worried that the only solution might be\nredoing the entire TN-10 trial which on its face seemed daunting and time\nconsuming; it would take at least five years to repeat the TN-10 study.\n\nThe lifeboat came from an unlikely source: the PROTECT trial, once the\ncenterpiece of the acquisition of teplizumab. Luckily, PROTECT started when\nthere was still some supply of the Lilly drug so some of those enrolled were\nreceiving it, and others were receiving the new drug. If Provention could use\nPROTECT data to prove the two drugs worked similarly it could save the day.\nThere really was no other option: it was PROTECT or nothing.\n\nLooking back at this fraught period and the perseverance and determination of\nthe Provention team, the T1D Fund president Doherty observed, \u201cYou said to\nyourself, \u2018Gosh, do you think this team can turn it around.\u2019 And I will say to\nAshleigh\u2019s and Francisco\u2019s great credit, they never gave up on it. It would\nhave been an understandable decision to say \u2018This is probably just not going\nto work.\u2019 But that was never in the cards for them. They believed the two\ndrugs were comparable and they believed in their results. They could have said\nthey see the handwriting on the wall, but I remember Leni saying, \u2018We can\naddress this, let\u2019s prove we are right.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn January 2022, seven months after the initial rejection letter, Provention\nshared its data with the FDA. After the meeting, it felt optimistic enough to\nrefile its application for approval of teplizumab. The clock started ticking\nonce again. The new decision date was set for August 2022. Frustratingly, in\nJuly, the FDA yet again extended the decision date for 90 days. Now, all\nanyone could do was wait.\n\n### Chapter 14: The Finish Line\n\nOn November 17, 2022, the FDA announced that it had approved what would hence\nforward be known as Tzield. \u201cToday\u2019s approval of a first-in-class therapy adds\nan important new treatment option for certain at-risk patients,\u201d said John\nSharretts, director of the Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity\nin the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cThe drug\u2019s potential to\ndelay clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes may provide patients with months\nto years without the burdens of disease.\u201d\n\nAbout 31 years after OKT3 was modified to become teplizumab, and 28 years on a\nroller coaster ride, teplizumab was on its way to patients.\n\nKevan Herold was in Chicago when the news came in: \u201cIt was the last day of a\nTrialNet meeting and I was to travel to give a talk the next day. Of course, I\nwas quite nervous because even the last day I had gotten some questions from\nProvention Bio about the past trial experiences. I boarded my plane and still\nhadn\u2019t seen anything. It was when I landed that I found out that the approval\nhappened. I got a text from my wife.\u201d\n\nJeff Bluestone was in his office. \u201cMy reaction was relief after so many\nchallenges to getting across the finish line\u2014questions about the manufactured\nproduct caused major delay, then there was a delay on July 1st due to concerns\nabout comparability. So, when I finally heard in November, it was a relief. I\nemailed Kevan to tell him as well as Lucienne and Jean-Francois Bach. I heard\nfrom a few people\u2014Margery Perry (a long-time JDRF volunteer involved in\nresearch grants) stands out as she was so supportive over the years and\ncontinuously made the case at JDRF. \u201cI guess, I have lived by the mantra\u2014do\nkick-ass science, collaborate like hell, and make a difference. That day, I\nfinally felt like I had made a difference.\u201d\n\nAaron Kowalski, JDRF\u2019s CEO, and someone who lives with T1D (as does his\nbrother), was at home. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those moments where you\u2019re like, wow, here\nwe are... a hundred years later [from the discovery of insulin] and we finally\nhave something that\u2019s not a treatment. For the first time we can actually do\nsomething about the disease. To me, that approval ushered in the optimism that\nI think our entire community is starting to feel that we are going to get this\njob done. We are going to walk away from diabetes, which is an amazing\nfeeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy life would be completely different if I hadn\u2019t gone into the trial,\u201d Madi\nsaid recently. \u201cEven if I develop [T1D] tomorrow, just being able to get\nthrough transitional years has helped me.\u201d Today, Buff is working toward her\nMBA with a concentration in health management at the University of South\nCarolina. Both Madi\u2019s and Claire\u2019s words are the ultimate tribute to those who\nnever doubted that teplizumab would eventually change lives and bring T1D\ncloser to being prevented and cured, a dream that powered Lee Ducat and the\nLuries all the way back in 1970 when they started JDRF, as well as Herold,\nBluestone, Chatenoud, and dozens of other scientists all over the world who\nliterally never gave up in the face of constant setbacks and skepticism right\nup to the end.\n\nIn mid-2023, the global French drug company Sanofi purchased Provention Bio\nfor $2.9 billion.\n\nToday, Buff and Wirt are both about eight years out from receiving their\nsingle course of teplizumab and neither one has symptomatic T1D.\n\nDoug Lowenstein\u2019s daughter was diagnosed with T1D in 2001 at age 14. Doug\nworked as a JDRF volunteer for 23 years in the search for therapies to cure,\nprevent, and treat T1D. This work included consulting with Provention Bio, and\ncontinues with its acquirer, Sanofi. The work is entirely focused on expanding\nscreening for T1D and does not involve marketing or selling teplizumab.\n\nBy Doug Lowenstein\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Tweet on Twitter\n\nJDRF\n\n## Read Next\n\n  * ### ATTD Brings Together Top Minds in Diabetes Research\n\nLeading researchers gathered for the ATTD meeting, which featured more than 50\nstudies presented by JDRF-funded researchers.\n\nRead More about ATTD Brings Together Top Minds in Diabetes Research\n\n  * ### Top Researchers Gather for the 17th ATTD Conference\n\nThis year\u2019s Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) meeting,\nwhich will be held on March 6-9, will have 50 JDRF-funded presenters.\n\nRead More about Top Researchers Gather for the 17th ATTD Conference\n\n  * ### JDRF T1D Fund Invests in vTv Therapeutics\n\nWith an investment from the JDRF T1D Fund, vTv Therapeutics will run a phase\nIII clinical trial of cadisegliatin (TTP399), an adjunct therapy to insulin.\n\nRead More about JDRF T1D Fund Invests in vTv Therapeutics\n\n### Your privacy\n\nWe value your privacy.
