As a result, we became Europe\u2019s\nleading provider of PaaS services, attracting developers and key accounts\nalike.\n\nMore importantly, we are unique in offering these solutions on our own\ninfrastructure, as well as on-premise or through various partners around the\nworld. We now do this with ISO 9001 and 27001:2022 certification, with HDS and\nSecNumCloud as our next targets.\n\nOver the years, our company and its product range evolved and expanded. But\nwe\u2019ve never compromised with our original vocation: innovation. That\u2019s why,\nalongside the continuous improvement of our services, interfaces and\nintegrations, we are massively investing in the development of our future, in\nsolutions that will meet our customers\u2019 needs ever more effectively, and over\nwhich we have full control.\n\nThis is where the independence and sovereignty of our offering comes in.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to build our own infrastructures, to choose a\nGNU/Linux system to which we actively contribute, and to use it on both our\nservers and our network equipment. It\u2019s also why we\u2019ve spent the last few\nyears developing Materia, a range of serverless, easy-to-use, pay-as-you-go\nproducts.\n\n  * What\u2019s Clever in our cloud ?\n\n## Materia Functions: WASM stands for compatibility and efficiency\n\nTo achieve this, we didn\u2019t hesitate to create our own low-level virtualization\nand function execution layer. We wanted to maintain our strong isolation\ncriteria by setting up virtual machines that we activate as close as possible\nto the CPU. We also wanted to be able to achieve good performance while\nopening up to a wide range of languages, rather than simply relying on v8 at\nthe risk of focusing almost exclusively on JavaScript.\n\nSo we opted instead for a solution that leverages the capabilities of the\nWebAssembly standard (WASM/WASI), which can be used with a wide range of\nlanguages, from Go to Zig as well as C, Rust or AssemblyScript... and of\ncourse JavaScript.\n\nAfter a successful first demo of our Tech Preview in Barcelona at the WASM.io\nconference last month, we\u2018ll be demonstrating again at Devoxx Paris, which\ntakes place at the Palais des Congr\u00e8s from April 17 to 19. Feel free to come\nand talk to us about it, and let us know if you\u2019re interested in taking part\nin the next stages of development of this product, which will be progressively\nopened up over the course of the year.\n\n## MateriaDB KV: our distributed, multi-protocol, serverless revolution\n\nAnother major innovation from our team is the new MateriaDB offering. To\nachieve this, we have designed our own serverless databases, built on the\nFoundationDB open source transactional engine, used, for example, by Apple for\nits iCloud services. We are also an active member of its community,\nparticipating in the development of its ecosystem.\n\nDistributed and robust, notably thanks to its high simulation capacity, it has\nenabled us to design and build a whole range of services to meet the different\nneeds expressed by our customers in recent years. Our approach is always open\nand resilient, with deployment across multiple availability zones,\ncompatibility with existing protocols and customers, and pay-as-you-go\nbilling.\n\nThe first to be publicly announced is MateriaDB KV, which, as its name\nsuggests, is a key-value database. To create one within your Clever Cloud\naccount, you have no instance size to choose, no storage capacity to worry\nabout. We simply provide you with a host address, a port and a token (based on\nthe Biscuit technology to which we actively contribute), and you\u2019re ready to\ngo!\n\nYou can then send us your keys and their contents. They will be synchronously\nreplicated in our three Paris datacenters. So you don\u2019t have to set up any\ncomplex configurations to ensure high availability, or even activate any\noptions. MateriaDB KV is resilient by design! And it adapts to individual\nneeds, as it\u2019s billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. It\u2019s the perfect solution for\nhobbyists, seasoned developers and key accounts alike.\n\n## Redis API compatibility... to start with\n\nWe didn\u2019t want this innovation to come at the cost of complex configuration,\nrequiring the use of special clients and ORMs. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed\nMateriaDB KV\u2019s own compatibility layers.\n\nTo \u201ctalk\u201d to it, you don\u2019t need a special API or tools specific to Clever\nCloud. You can use it with existing solutions for DynamoDB, GraphQL or Redis.\nThe latter is the first of the compatibility layers available in our test\nphase. It enables customers using a Redis instance for their application to\nmigrate to MateriaDB KV with just a few clicks in their interface or via\nClever Tools.\n\nThis solution will be publicly demonstrated for the first time at Devoxx\nParis, which takes place at the Palais des Congr\u00e8s from April 17 to 19. It\nwill then be rapidly made available to all our customers in alpha. Feel free\nto come and talk to us about it, and the other Materia services we\u2019ll be\noffering later this year.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be demonstrating other upcoming new features, such as our Keycloak-\nas-a-Service solution in partnership with Please Open It, and celebrating the\nrelease of version 1.0 of our in-house, open source load balancer, developed\nin Rust: S\u014cZU!\n\nTo keep up to date with our regular developments, be sure to follow our\nChangelog (via its RSS feed), or this blog.
