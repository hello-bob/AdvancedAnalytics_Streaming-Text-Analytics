MacOS users also enjoy the similar\nconvenience as Windows and Linux users now that the related pull request has\nbeen merged. In our comparisons here the OpenCV VideoCapture class and\ncorresponding code snippet were employed to ensure an objective evaluation,\ndevoid of any alterations or filters, thereby maintaining the integrity and\nauthenticity of these comparisons.\n\n    \n    \n    import cv2 as cv orbbec_cap = cv.VideoCapture(0, cv.CAP_OBSENSOR) if orbbec_cap.isOpened() == False: exit(\"Fail to open camera.\") while True: if orbbec_cap.grab(): # RGB data ret_bgr, bgr_image = orbbec_cap.retrieve(None, cv.CAP_OBSENSOR_BGR_IMAGE) # depth data ret_depth, depth_map = orbbec_cap.retrieve(None, cv.CAP_OBSENSOR_DEPTH_MAP) if ret_depth and ret_bgr: color_depth_map = cv.applyColorMap(cv.convertScaleAbs(depth_map, alpha=0.0255), cv.COLORMAP_JET) # show the images cv.imshow('RBG', bgr_image) cv.imshow('Depth', color_depth_map) else: print(\"Fail to grab data from the camera.\") if cv.pollKey() &gt;= 0: break orbbec_cap.release()\n\n## About The Cameras\n\nOrbbec is a global leader in the design and manufacturing of 3D cameras. It\noffers a diverse range of 3D cameras tailored for various use cases. The\nGemini 2 series is a collection of stereo vision 3D cameras that offer a wide\nfield of view (FOV), an extended depth sensing range, and high-quality depth\ndata.\n\nDesigned for easy setup and portability, the stereo vision 3D cameras\nRealSense D400 series also feature high depth resolution. We conducted some\nrapid tests with the Orbbec Gemini 2 L and RealSense D455 cameras in various\nenvironments, with the results displayed below. The output depth images are\nmapped to false color images using the JET colormap for visualization.\n\nJET colormap\n\n## Depth Comparisons\n\n  *     * Comparison A: In the office\n\nOrbbec Gemini 2 L\n\nIntel\u00ae RealSense D455\n\n  *     * Comparison B: In the corridor\n\nOrbbec Gemini 2 L\n\nIntel\u00ae RealSense D455\n\n  *     * Comparison C: Reflections\n\nOrbbec Gemini 2 L\n\nIntel\u00ae RealSense D455\n\n  *     * Comparison D: Strong lights are within the field of view\n\nOrbbec Gemini 2 L\n\nIntel\u00ae RealSense D455\n\n  *     * Comparison E: In the office with various objects present\n\nOrbbec Gemini 2 L\n\nIntel\u00ae RealSense D455\n\nOverall, the colored depth images from Gemini 2 L are more stable and smoother\nthan those from RealSense D455. This is essential for 3D vision based\napplications. In the depth images of Gemini 2 L, the edges of objects are\nsmooth and continuous without jaggedness or fluctuation, which ensure the\nintegrity of the object contours. For instance, the edges of various objects\nin Scene E and the contour of the person in Scene B.\n\nMoreover, the FOVs of both the depth and RGB sensors of Gemini 2 L are\nslightly wider than those of RealSense D455. This verifies the cameras\u2019\ntechnical specifications.\n\nFOV(HxV)| Gemini 2 L| D455  \n---|---|---  \nDepth| 91\u00b0 x 66\u00b0| 87\u00b0 x 58\u00b0  \nRGB| 94\u00b0 x 68\u00b0| 90\u00b0 x 65\u00b0  \n  \nIn the case of Scene C, reflections have a significant impact on the detection\nof the distance. The depth data of the TV surface is incorrect from RealSense\nD455 due to the reflections from the lights caused by the TV screen, while the\ndepth image from Gemini 2 L keeps almost consistent. However RealSense has\nanother model D455f which adds to D455 an IR pass filter pass over the lenses.\nThis is to mitigate repetitive pattern and false object detection due to light\nreflections. Therefore the depth image from D455f should be much better than\nthat of D455. However since we don\u2019t have the D455f model we couldn\u2019t conduct\na test. In the case of Scene B, the light reflections on the floor also affect\nD455\u2019s ability to detect the floor.\n\nThe above results also show that in some cases Gemini 2 L performs worse than\nRealSense D455. In Scene C RealSense D455 has better detection of the glasses.\nStrong lights from the window can also cause problems for Gemini 2 L as\ndemonstrated in the results of Scenes D and E. This is because that in\nchanllenging light conditions RealSense D455 leverages passive stereo vision\nto improve its depth sensing capability, while Gemini 2 L doesn\u2019t integrate\nthe functionality.\n\nComparing the depth images of Scene B, it can be observed that Gemini 2 L has\nlonger depth range. The ideal range of RealSense D455 is 0.6m to 6m, and that\nof Gemini 2 L is 0.2m to 10m. The depth accuracy varies depending on the\ndistance. There are various metrics that can be defined to evaluate depth\nquality, and a flat white wall parallel to the camera\u2019s front, as shown in the\nfigure below, is often used to help measure these metrics.\n\n  *     * Comparison F: Depth image of a white wall parallel to the camera\u2019s front at the distance of 0.6m\n\nOrbbec Gemini 2 L\n\nIntel\u00ae RealSense D455\n\n  *     * Comparison G: Depth image of a white wall parallel to the camera\u2019s front at the distance of 0.3m\n\nOrbbec Gemini 2 L\n\nIntel\u00ae RealSense D455\n\nThe GIFs show the depth images of a white wall which is parallel to the\ncamera\u2019s front at the distance of 0.6m and 0.3m. Qualitatively, it can be seen\nthat at distance of 0.6m the depth images from RealSense D455 is not entirely\nflat and stable, while those from Gemini 2 L are; and at the distance of 0.3m\nGemini 2 L can output correct depth data, while RealSense D455 can not.\n\nQuantitatively, root mean square error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the spatial\nnoise of the depth data from the camera across a region of interest (ROI),\nwhile temporal noise measures this variation in depth over time.\n\nIn the figure above, z is the depth value (in mm) of a depth pixel (blue\ndots), the fitted plane is the best-fit plane to the depth data, and d is the\ndistance of the depth pixel to the fitted plane. The RMSE is defined as .\nPlane fitting of the data helps reduce the sensitivity of the measurement to\nalignment errors between the camera and the wall.\n\nThe Gemini 2 L and RealSense D455 are set at distance ranging from 0.6m to\n1.2m from the wall with intervals of 0.1m, and the RMSE is shown below:\n\nFrom the figures, it can be seen that at various distances and different ROIs,\nthe RMSEs of the Gemini 2 L are consistently smaller than those of RealSense\nD455. This indicates that depth data from Gemini 2 L is more spatially stable\nthan that from RealSense D455.\n\nBelow are the results of another test that shows the spatial variation of the\ndepth values over time. The standard deviation (STD) in depth values across an\nROI is computed over consecutive 600 frames. We could see that over time and\nacross different ROI scales, the STDs are smaller and remain consistent.\nHowever the STDs of RealSense D455 are much more volatile.\n\nTemporal noise may be defined as a standard deviation in depth values over a\nspecific number of frames (e.g. 50 or 100). It is typically measured per pixel\nand then an average or median is taken over the ROI to represent the temporal\nnoise for that device and ROI. We take 50 depth images in a certain time frame\nof the white wall and compute the average value of the standard deviation\nmatrix. The temporal noise for Gemini 2 L and RealSense D455 are 0.1488mm and\n1.4102mm respectively.This shows that Gemini 2 L also has smaller temporal\nnoise compared to RealSense D455.\n\nOrbbec released Gemini 2 XL, a long range 3D camera suitable for outdoor\nscenarios, as an enhanced model following Gemini 2 L. Similar tests are also\nconducted using Gemini 2 XL, and indeed it yielded much better results\ncompared to Gemini 2 L with even smoother and more stable depth images, less\nsusceptible to strong lights and better glass object detection.\n\nScene CScene DScene E\n\n## Prices\n\nLastly, let\u2019s take a look at the price of these cameras, noting that RealSense\ncameras have been discontinued since August 2021.\n\nOrbbec| Gemini 2| Gemini 2 L| Gemini 2 XL (POE)  \n---|---|---|---  \nPrice| $267| $326| $447  \nRealSense| D435i| D455/D455f  \n---|---|---  \nPrice| $334| $419/$439  \n  \n### Related Posts\n\nAI Tools Edge AI\n\nTake Your Computer Vision App to the Edge\n\nOctober 7, 2020 1 Comment\n\nAI Tools Content Partnership Deep Learning Edge AI OpenVINO Tutorial\n\nOpenVINO model optimization\n\nOctober 16, 2020 0 Comments\n\nCompetition Edge AI News OpenCV AI Kit\n\nOpenCV Spatial AI Competition Winners Announced!\n\nNovember 18, 2020 3 Comments\n\n#### Become a Member\n\nStay up to date on OpenCV and Computer Vision news\n\nJoin our Newsletter\n\n### Free Courses\n\n  * TensorFlow & Keras Bootcamp\n  * OpenCV Bootcamp\n  * Python for Beginners\n\n### Courses\n\n  * Mastering OpenCV with Python\n  * Fundamentals of CV & IP\n  * Deep Learning with PyTorch\n  * Deep Learning with TensorFlow & Keras\n  * Computer Vision & Deep Learning Applications\n  * Mastering Generative AI for Art\n\n### Partnership\n\n  * Intel, OpenCV\u2019s Platinum Member\n  * Gold Membership\n  * Development Partnership\n  * CUDA\n  * ARM\n\n### Resources\n\n  * News\n  * Books\n  * Podcast\n  * Links\n  * Media Kit\n\n### General Link\n\n  * About\n  * Releases\n  * License\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 , OpenCV team Contact Us | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions\n\nFacebookTwitterLinkedIn\n\nFacebookTwitterLinkedIn\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
