The purpose of this work was straightforward. Marx wanted to\nunderstand how the class struggle in France had \u2018made it possible for a\ngrotesque and mediocre personality to play a hero\u2019s part.\u2019 Much of The\nEighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852/69), as the work would be known,\naccordingly consisted of fine-grained political and economic analysis. But\nMarx opened in a more philosophical vein. After quipping that history repeats\nitself first as tragedy and then as farce, he reflected upon the role that\nhistorical parallelism played in shaping revolutionary action:\n\n> The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the\n> brain of the living. And just when they seem engaged in revolutionising\n> themselves and things, in creating something that has never yet existed,\n> precisely in such periods of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up\n> the spirits of the past to their service and borrow from them names, battle-\n> cries and costumes in order to present the new scene of world history in\n> this time-honoured disguise and this borrowed language.\n\nThis tendency had pervaded European history, Marx thought, and occasionally\nserved the ends of progress. The cloak of Roman republicanism, for instance,\nhad helped French society lurch blindly forward during the revolution of 1789.\nIn the present case, however, the appropriated symbolism of that earlier\nrevolution served no higher purpose than to veil a grifter\u2019s power grab in a\nmore compelling guise.\n\nMarx points toward one of the more paradoxical tendencies of modern political\nlife: the more times feel unprecedented, the more we reach for past parallels.\nWe do so, however, not only to legitimate new regimes. Just as often,\nhistorical analogies are invoked to explain, predict and condemn. The past\ndecade alone offers a trove of examples. Among them, the use of \u2018fascism\u2019 to\ncharacterise Right-wing populist movements has generated the most heat, giving\nrise to a multifaceted debate about the legitimacy of historical analogy as a\nmode of political analysis. But there are others that have occasioned less\nself-reflection. In reckoning with the possibility of open conflict between\nthe United States and China, for instance, foreign policy experts have\nroutinely likened the escalating tension to the Cold War, the First World War,\nand even the Peloponnesian War. Similarly, in the early days of COVID-19, many\ndealt with the uncertainty of the pandemic by turning to the Spanish Flu, the\nBlack Death, and the Great Plague of Athens for guidance. Something of the\nsort is also happening in real time with generative AI. How we interpret the\nrisk that it poses hinges in large part on which analogy we favour: will it be\nmost akin to the Industrial Revolution, the nuclear bomb, or \u2013 perhaps most\nhorrifying of all \u2013 the consulting firm McKinsey?\n\nIf many of these parallels seem self-evident, one recurring point of reference\ndoes not: Thucydides, the ancient Athenian general and author of History of\nthe Peloponnesian War. Though hardly a household name, he has been a favourite\nof those intent on doom-scrolling the historical record for relevant exempla.\nIn the first month of the COVID-19 shutdown, for instance, so much was written\nabout his account of the Athenian plague that one prominent scholar deemed\nThucydides himself to be a virus. Something comparable could be said of\nThucydides\u2019 role in the viral discourse surrounding Sino-American relations.\nEver since the early 2010s, when Graham Allison began referring to the stress\non global order produced by hegemonic rivalry as \u2018Thucydides\u2019 Trap\u2019, foreign\npolicy discussions have themselves often appeared trapped by the need to\nbalance geopolitical analysis with exegesis of an ancient text.\n\nHowever strange Thucydides\u2019 prominence may seem, the tradition of looking his\nway in moments of existential crisis is well established. During the American\nCivil War, for example, his \u2018Funeral Oration of Pericles\u2019 served as a model\nfor Abraham Lincoln\u2019s famed Gettysburg Address, while his account of Athenian\ndefeat helped inspire an overhaul of the US Naval War College curriculum\nduring the war in Vietnam. In Europe, both English and German propagandists\nexcerpted History of the Peloponnesian War during the First World War in\nsupport of their causes, and soldiers reported reading Thucydides in the\ntrenches. In subsequent decades, prominent writers in both England and Italy\nused Thucydides to reflect their concerns over the rise of European fascism.\n\nThis cultish appeal has nevertheless come at a cost. While many have tried in\nearnest to wring wisdom from Thucydides\u2019 text, others have sought little more\nthan an ancient authority for their shower thoughts. Careless glosses and\nmisattributed quotes abound, both in the anarchic spaces of social media and\nin others that should be held to a higher standard: the website for Harvard\u2019s\nBelfer Center, for instance, which features an apocryphal quote lifted from\nthe first Wonder Woman movie, or on the desk of the late Colin Powell when\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIf this should seem a sad fate for any writer, it is a particularly ironic one\nfor Thucydides. He was both a vocal proponent of accurately accounting for the\npast and a careful analyst of the textured nature of historical repetition.\nResistant to simplification and rich in \u2018unuttered thoughts\u2019 (to quote\nFriedrich Nietzsche), Thucydides recognised that an effective understanding of\nthe relationship between past, present and future would be both highly complex\nand absolutely critical for prudent political judgment. This combination did\nnot bode well for the ancient Athenians, who ended up suffering dearly for\ntheir mishandling of historical analogies, and it is not clear that we have\nthe resources to do much better. But we stand to learn more by thinking with\nThucydides about the role of historical analogy in political life than by\nsimply pilfering his text in search of such analogies. If nothing else, taking\nsuch a tack helps to remind us of the risks involved in abusing specious\nparallels in the way that we are prone to do.\n\nThucydides was unusual among classical writers in stating directly what he\nhoped his readers would gain from his work. He would be content, he says, if\nHistory of the Peloponnesian War was deemed \u2018useful\u2019 by those who wanted \u2018to\nscrutinise what actually happened and would happen again, given the human\ncondition, in the same or similar fashion\u2019 (my translation). The description\nnevertheless leaves readers wanting. How exactly such knowledge should prove\nuseful is underspecified, and scholars have long disagreed over what\nThucydides expected the utility of his text to be.\n\nMost assume that Thucydides tried to offer his reader a type of foreknowledge\nthat could potentially translate into active control over the politico-\nhistorical process. Taken to its extreme, this \u2018optimistic\u2019 interpretation\nreads History of the Peloponnesian War as a sort of \u2018political systems users\u2019\nmanual\u2019, as Josiah Ober put it, capable of creating expert political\ntechnicians. Recognising regularities in the historical process, it is\nthought, should lead to predictive capacity, which in turn allows for\npolitical mastery. Proceeding in this fashion, Thucydides takes himself to be\ntraining master statesmen capable of solving the fundamental problems of\npolitical life.\n\nOthers detect a more pessimistic outlook in Thucydides\u2019 stated ambition. They\nsuggest that the lessons on offer are insufficient to produce control over\nevents even if they can help the reader detect regularities in the political\nprocess. Unexpected events will often upset our expectations, as the plague\ndid in Athens, and the ignorance of non-experts will often disrupt the\ntranslation of technical insight into effective policy. This problem will be\nparticularly acute within a democratic context, where a popular eagerness to\napply bastardised versions of such insights may even make matters worse. In\nthis interpretation, Thucydides is \u2018useful\u2019 to the extent that he can temper\nthe ambitions of those wishing to impose rational order onto political life.\nThe best we can hope for, it seems, is to minimise our self-harm.\n\nWe must learn how to choose the right parallels if we are to judge well in\npolitics\n\nAt issue between these two interpretive poles is the basic presumption of\napplied social science: to what extent can the recognition of recurring\npatterns translate into effective political policy? Yet, Thucydides was not\nwriting social science as we know it. To the extent that his text articulated\nanything like fundamental laws of political behaviour, it did so through\nexemplary instances and carefully curated parallelisms. The Peloponnesian War\nserved as a paradigmatic event for Thucydides: a particular instance that\nrevealed general truths. It served this representative role, however, not\nbecause it was typical. Rather, it was exemplary because it was uniquely\n\u2018great\u2019. The war would prove useful, in other words, not because of history\u2019s\nstrict repetition, but by the pregnancy of similarity and the reader\u2019s ability\nto parse analogies effectively.\n\nThucydides schools his readers in just how difficult such acts of analogical\ninterpretation can be. A series of carefully considered verbal parallels, or\nwhat Jacqueline de Romilly has called fils conducteurs (\u2018guiding threads\u2019),\nextend through Thucydides\u2019 narrative like a web, ensnaring the reader in a\nconstant and, at times, overwhelming sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Sometimes, repetitions\npoint towards important explanatory insights. But they also suggest likenesses\nthat can lead the reader astray. Time and again, Thucydides confounds the\nexpectations he has created. Even upon rereading, one can feel an internal\ntension between what one knows to be the case and what one is nonetheless led\nto expect will happen. Whether it is your first or your 15th read, you can\nstill catch yourself thinking: this time surely Athens will win.\n\nThe evident lesson behind all of this is that we must learn how to choose the\nright parallels if we are to judge well in politics. But Thucydides also knew\nthat we did not have full control of the analogies that shape our\ndeliberations, especially in public life. Our analogical vocabulary is woven\ndirectly into the cultural fabric, a product of the contingencies that shape\ncollective memory. We choose them no more than we choose the language we\nspeak. (Once again, Marx: \u2018Men make their own history, but they do not make it\njust as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by\nthemselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and\ntransmitted from the past.\u2019) Some events, such as the Persian Wars in\nThucydides\u2019 day or the Second World War in our own, simply loom too large to\navoid, and we are easily held captive by the emotional weight of their\ncultural significance. Thucydides measured this gravitational pull also in\nterms of \u2018greatness\u2019, a concept that he identified closely with the production\nof collective trauma.\n\nThe danger inherent in this, of course, is that emotional resonance is often a\npoor guide to explanatory power. The most immediately compelling analogies can\nprove deeply misleading. The most haunting Thucydidean parallelism to\nhighlight this point occurs through the phrase \u2018few out of many returned home\nagain\u2019. Thucydides repeats this line three times, each to memorialise a\nharrowing military defeat: two massive Athenian expeditions, first to Egypt\nand then to Sicily, and a surprise attack that caught an entire army of\nAmbraciots asleep in their beds. Thucydides\u2019 verbal repetition tempts the\nreader into seeing these events as an analogous set. Yet the last of these to\noccur, the Sicilian disaster, could not have been prevented by learning the\nlessons of the previous two. Quite the opposite. Rather than suffer from\nneglect by the metropole, as the Egyptian Expedition had, the Sicilian\nExpedition failed in large part due to the city\u2019s miscalculated interventions.\nRather than profit from the creative generalship of Demosthenes, which had\nproven decisive in the victory over the Ambraciots, his arrival in Sicily only\nfurther exacerbated the carnage.\n\nThe seductive pull of \u2018great\u2019 events is not an incidental danger to the use of\nhistorical analogies. If historians tend to debate the appeal of these\nparallels primarily in terms of their explanatory value, the motive behind\ntheir day-to-day use is arguably more visceral. Analogies serve more as\nvehicles for generating awe and outrage than for unearthing more nuanced\nunderstandings. Yet, even when used merely as rhetorical tools, they can carry\nserious diagnostic implications.\n\nThese implications aren\u2019t always detrimental. Figurative rhetoric can use the\nresources of collective memory to move people toward better policy when\nexplanatory traction aligns with affective resonance. Thucydides\u2019 Pericles\nappears exemplary of this. Early in the war, the celebrated Athenian leader\nfaces a crowd wearied by plague and the general miseries of war. In an attempt\nto steel their resolve, he draws on two coordinated analogies. In the first,\nhe describes the Athenian struggle in terms of a Greek hero overcoming labours\nin the pursuit of glory. In the second, he likens the democracy\u2019s empire to a\ntyranny that, in defeat, must confront the widespread hatred it has incurred.\n\nIn paralleling the Athenians to two of the most provocative figures in the\nGreek imagination, Pericles goads the people back to their original resolve\nwith the alternating spikes of pride and fear. And he does so perceptively.\nThucydides draws on the same analogical models when characterising Athenian\npower and political culture in the opening pages of History of the\nPeloponnesian War. It\u2019s to Pericles\u2019 further credit that he doesn\u2019t simply\ndiscard the analogies after they\u2019ve served his immediate purposes. Rather, the\nneed to balance the \u2018heroic\u2019 and \u2018tyrannical\u2019 elements of the imperial\ndemocracy serves as a framing priority for his entire war strategy \u2013 a\nstrategy that Thucydides himself explicitly praises.\n\nThis is not to say that Periclean policy does not prove costly for the\nAthenians. It serves to enhance the devastation of the plague by demanding\nthat the Athenians crowd together behind their city walls, thereby\nexacerbating Athenian deaths. But the costs of this policy do not arise from\nPericles\u2019 misuse of analogical rhetoric. The experience of the plague only\nproves a point that should already be obvious, namely, that using analogies\nwell cannot save us from forces beyond our control. Elsewhere, however,\nThucydides makes it clear that the misuse of analogies can actually invite\ncatastrophes on par with those suffered by chance.\n\nA false version of the story weighed heavily on the minds of the Athenians as\nthey made a series of bad decisions\n\nNowhere is this message more clearly drawn than in Athens\u2019 climactic defeat in\nSicily. The toll of this disaster is hard to overstate: not only did Athenian\ncasualties approach those of the plague, the mishap so shook the city\u2019s faith\nin popular rule that an oligarchy temporarily displaced the democracy in its\naftermath. Many events contributed to this grim result. Yet Thucydides\u2019 own\nexplanation of why the expedition failed began with a story about an event\nthat had occurred nearly a century before the Athenian fleet set sail.\n\nHarmodius and Aristogeiton were towering figures in Athenian civic legend. As\n\u2018the Tyrannicides\u2019, they were credited with putting an end to Athenian\ndespotism and instigating the transition towards democracy. For this, they\nwere heroised and memorialised with unparalleled reverence. And yet,\nThucydides tells his reader, their reputation was based on a fundamental\nmisunderstanding of what they\u2019d actually done. Far from being civic\nbenefactors or even tyrannicides, Thucydides reveals, they\u2019d murdered the\ntyrant\u2019s younger brother in a romantic rivalry gone wrong. The consequences of\nthis murder were devastating: the previously beneficent ruler spiralled into\nparanoia, resulting in increasingly harsh treatment of the Athenian people.\n\nAthenian lore had gotten everything backward: the so-called Tyrannicides, far\nfrom saving the city from despotism in an act of self-sacrifice, had caused\nthis despotic turn for eminently personal reasons. Nevertheless, it was this\nfalse version of the story that weighed heavily on the minds of the Athenians\nas they made a series of bad decisions in the early days of the Sicilian\nExpedition. It did not do so unprompted. Rather, this misunderstanding proved\na useful tool among aspiring elite leaders within Athens, each of whom was\neager to clear a path for their own ascent. Standing in the way of most,\nhowever, was the Sicilian Expedition\u2019s most talented general, a brash and\ncharismatic leader named Alcibiades. When a series of sacrilegious acts\noccurred on the eve of the expedition, Alcibiades\u2019 rivals pushed the (false)\nTyrannicide parallel, suggested a tyrannical coup was afoot, and implicated\nAlcibiades. There was no evidence for this, but in the resultant hysteria it\ndid not matter. Faced with certain prosecution, Alcibiades defected to Sparta,\nturning the tide of war against Athens.\n\nThis elite manipulation of popular misunderstanding effectively inverts\nPericles\u2019 constructive use of heroic and tyrannical parallels. By painting\nAlcibiades as a potential tyrant, his opponents easily conjured up an\nexaggerated state of fear that allowed them to achieve their private ends at\nthe expense of the city. In the end, Thucydides shows that the analogy between\npast and present was indeed illuminating: personal rivalries once again led to\ncivic casualties that resulted in brutal and self-undermining politics. But\nthe cost of this collective delusion would become clear only later. Hindered\nby increasingly poor generalship and an opponent emboldened by Spartan help,\n\u2018few out of many\u2019 would make it home from Sicily, and Athens would soon\ndevolve into civil war.\n\nIn May 1861, Marx found himself increasingly depressed about the American\nCivil War. The best he could do to mitigate his low mood, he told a friend,\nwas to read Thucydides. \u2018These ancients,\u2019 he explained, \u2018always remain new.\u2019\nThey do so, we might add, by forever remaining old, thereby creating the space\nwe need to find ourselves in the contrast.\n\nIt is tempting to see Thucydides\u2019 digression about the tyrannicide analogy as\nthe key to understanding his historical method. Had the Athenians only\nunderstood the truth of their own history, we might think, they wouldn\u2019t have\nmade such easy prey for self-serving politicians. In this vein, Thucydides\u2019\nproject may seem to be that of saving future generations from comparable\nmistakes. As the \u2018greatest\u2019 conflict to ever beset the Greeks, unique in both\nits glory and its trauma, the Peloponnesian War would soon usurp the\nTyrannicides and the Trojan War as the privileged source of political analogy.\nAs such, it promised unparalleled resources for anyone trying to persuade\nothers to their cause. It is reasonable to think that Thucydides expected his\nwork to hinder the ability of bad actors to abuse this power. At the same\ntime, it is unclear just how far it was in his ability to do so. The\nAthenians, after all, had everything they needed to realise the truth about\nthe Tyrannicides. What they lacked was the will to scrutinise something that\nthey felt to be intuitively correct. Thucydides could give posterity an\naccount of the Peloponnesian War that might stop it from becoming fodder for\nfalse parallels if considered carefully. But he could not thereby prevent\nopportunists from constructing misleading analogies on its back.\n\nApproaching Thucydides\u2019 text from the angle of historical analogy does not\nresolve the age-old disagreement between his optimistic and pessimistic\nreaders. It may nevertheless encourage us to recognise that a more realistic\napproach to political agency must exist somewhere between these two poles.\nThucydides intimates that the careful art of drawing fitting analogies, honed\nas it may be through the diligent study of political history, will assist some\nto think more clearly about the present. But mastering this art should not be\nconfused with political mastery. The power of \u2018great\u2019 events will remain too\neasily harnessed, and too hard to control, to serve only those who are clear-\nheaded and well-intentioned. Specious analogies will remain a danger for as\nlong as people stand to benefit from them, and their emotional pull will\ncontinue to knock even the most astute off balance. And yet, if there\u2019s little\nchance that political life will ever be freed from distortive thinking, it may\nstill prove less hazardous for those who look toward history as something more\nthan a sourcebook of convenient parallels.\n\nHistory of ideasThe ancient worldHistory\n\n26 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nThe environment\n\nEmergency action\n\nCould civil disobedience be morally obligatory in a society on a collision\ncourse with climate catastrophe?\n\nRupert Read\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHome\n\nReturn of the descendants\n\nI migrated to my ancestral homeland in a search for identity.
