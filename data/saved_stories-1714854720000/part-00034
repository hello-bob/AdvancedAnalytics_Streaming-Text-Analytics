It was given away\nmonths ago to help another Amiga user. I needed to replace it, and I realised\nthat I\u2019m completely out of Amiga floppy drives. So, I decided to see if I\ncould convert a PC one to fit. Here is the story.\n\n## The Drive\n\nI have a spare Citizen Z1DE-57Aa drive that was completely missing a fascia.\nIn fact, I used it in an earlier blog post attached to a Greaseweazle to\nbackup a copy-protected disk.\n\n## Circuit Modification\n\nAmiga floppy drives use the Shugart standard, PC floppy drives use something a\nlittle different, they also use a different ID on the cable. So, the drives\nneed a little modification. A description of the changes needed can be found\nin an earlier blog post. I didn\u2019t know the exact changes that needed to be\nmade to this drive, I could have buzzed around and figured it out, but\nluckily, someone had already documented it. I made the changes specified, and\nthe end result looked like this.\n\n## Physical Modification\n\nThere are a couple of initial problems we need to solve to make it fit, the\nfirst is that the drive is slimmer than an Amiga floppy drive. I happen to\nknow (don\u2019t ask me why, I can\u2019t remember) that to make PC floppy drives the\nsame height, you need to raise them by 6mm. I therefore screwed some 6mm\nstandoffs to the bottom of the drive and used the original Amiga standoffs for\nthe back two screwed into that.\n\nNext up is the eject button, the Amiga eject button needs to be in a specific\nplace to fit out of the computer, it is a different place to the location of\nthe drive. After six attempts with minor design tweaking each time, I managed\nto print something that fitted perfectly. The top is my print, the bottom is\nthe original button.\n\nI could have printed using a colour-matched PLA to the Amiga, but I actually\nquite like the contrasting black.\n\n## Fit Testing\n\nNow that the drive has been sufficiently modified, it is time to test\neverything. The drive fitted fine in place and the eject was nice and smooth.\n\nOnce I popped the lid on the Amiga, things weren\u2019t quite so smooth, the lid of\nthe floppy drive overhangs the face, which meant that the lid of the Amiga\nwouldn\u2019t fit. I solved this by pulling the lid of the floppy drive back\nslightly.\n\nThe next problem is that disks would get stuck during eject. They would get\nwedged between the drive door and the casing of the Amiga. This was easy to\nresolve by simply removing the drive door. This might be why Amiga 500 drives\nnever had one.\n\n## The Result\n\nThis is the final fit with the disk in. I could maybe clean up the eject\nbutton a little, but it does have a nice feel to it, and is functional.\n\nDoes it work? Let\u2019s put in a disk-read intensive game, Lemmings.\n\nI\u2019m going to call that a win!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
