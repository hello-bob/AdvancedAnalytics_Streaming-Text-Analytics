In front of us lies a society driven for\nthe sake of productivity, the mechanics increasingly directed by artificial\nintelligence to serve corporate interests. Behind us lies centuries of\nexperiments in social organization that provide the historical and material\nfoundation of society. Some failed with communism\u2019s collapse in 1991, while\nthe capitalist experiment shifted to the authoritarian \u2018capitalism with\nChinese characteristics\u2019 in the east, or the more subtly coercive neoliberal\nexperiment in the west. This experiment has raised many out of poverty, and\nyet has not improved the quality of life. As \u201cWe stand on the brink... we peer\ninto the abyss...\u201d (Poe, 2022).we peer into the abyss,^1 many grow sick with\nemergent This is not to say that these diseases are naturally occurring facts,\nnor that these diseases do not exist. They are really experienced diseases\nthat are contingent upon existing conditions of neoliberal capitalism.social\ndiseases\u2014anxiety, depression, exhaustion, and burnout. These conditions are a\nsymptom of a way of life that lacks direction. With the gradual shift to\nsecular life, we\u2019ve turned away from communal practices that provide spaces\nand times that lead to human flourishing. These practices included holidays in\nwhich contemplation, prayer, and meditative practices were observed\u2014 e.g.like\nShabbat and Sundays. These were times allocated to prayer, creative play,\nleisure, reflection, rest, and quiet solitude that are no longer protected or\nmade available to greater society. Liberal democracies have abandoned the\npractice of community-rest, pushing it into the private domain of the\nindividual, but what they have lost is leisure and the communities that exist\nthere. The position presented here is not a call to return to some golden\npast, or a renewed spiritual order, but a historical account of the\nperspectives that led to the loss of leisure. It explores a revitalization of\ntimes and spaces for human flourishing that were formerly protected by a\nspiritual order, but can equally be rooted in secular thought. I propose\npoints of resistance to a dominant social order that seeks to continually\ncapture the vestiges of free time.\n\nAt this juncture, society can collectively decide what the future will hold\nfor humanity\u2014we can determine what that looks like, what we\u2019re building, and\nto what ends. If we do not rise to this challenge, then the instrumental power\nthat has emerged out of neoliberal capitalism will decide our future for its\nown banal ends. Together we can decide if we want increases in productivity to\nappear in the form of profits for the few, or as surplus time allocated to the\nmany\u2014the latter of which can be used for leisure and the concrete activity of\ncreating a brighter future for all.\n\n\u201dThe greatest difficulty with most subjects is to do them well; therefore,\nplease to remember this is an apology.

I will do my best to argue for the\nidler, the amateur, the layabout\u2013for they are the experts of idleness.

The great arcs of history are determined\nby the rulers of their period, and individuals are capable (to a certain\nextent) of generating their own personal narratives within that period.\nBunyard 2018, p. 4.\"History, therefore, is a process directed by human agents\nto shape their world, and create their own identities through that\nactivity\".^7\n\nIn order to establish an understanding of the perception of time across\nhistory, I will begin with a periodization that draws from the philosophical\nanthropology of Guy Debord in See chapters V. and VI.The Society of the\nSpectacle.^4 Debord presents a series of historical periods characterized by\nsocial structures that engender different perceptions of time called\n\u2018temporalities\u2019. The following table lists these distinct periods. Each age is\nmediated by a form of social organization, and that organization generates a\ncorresponding temporality. I will describe each in turn.\n\nAge| Social organization| Temporality| Related periods  \n---|---|---|---  \nAge of Gods & Men| Mythic society| Cyclical time (early)| The Neolithic Age to\nthe Early Bronze Age. Prior to the First Egyptian Dynasty, and before the\ninvention of agriculture.  \nAge of Cyclical Nature| Agrarian society| Cyclical time (late)| From the\ninvention of agriculture to the invention of written language. Early Bronze\nAge to the Middle Bronze Age.  \nAge of Kings| Historical society| Mythical time / Irreversible time| From the\nemergence of cities and the invention of specialization: nobility, warriors,\npriests. From the Etruscans to Roman Republic to the Holy Roman Empire. From\nthe Zhou Dynasty to Ming Dynasty. The emergence of mercantilism & nation-\nstates. Late Bronze Age to Late Middle Age.  \nAge of Economic Production| Industrial society| Chronological time| The\nEnlightenment, the era of the nation-state and the industrial revolution. Late\nMiddle Age to the end of the Machine Age.  \nAge of the Autonomous Spectacle| Spectacular society| Pseudo-cyclical time /\nSpectacular time / Perpetual present| Post-War Era, Information Age, the\nemergence of global communications, globalization, and mass media.  \n  \nEach age describes the dominant forces that structure daily life\u2014the A\nzeitgeber is an external cue that entrains or synchronizes an organism\u2019s\nbiological rhythms. These are natural factors like light, temperature,\nseasons, but can include social cues like work schedules or gig\napps.zeitgeber, which shape perceptions of time. There is overlap between\nages, both temporally and spatially. An age is more keenly experienced in the\ncity than in the countryside. The procession of one age to the next doesn\u2019t\nentail that the previous age has ended, but that its\u2019 forces have receded to\nthe background\u2014they become infrastructural rather than hegemonic. To\nillustrate, the mythic narratives that arose from the Age of Gods & Men remain\nwith us in the form of stories and metaphors that provide us with rich\ncultural allegory. In another case, the Age of Kings had no definitive end, in\nfact, relics like the Queen of England still exist, but monarchy is less\nimportant these days, and thus has become merely cultural. Institutions like\nreligion, which previously dominated social organization have similarly\nreceded. In some sectors, secular life has completely subsumed spiritual life,\nand spiritual life is relegated to the private domain of the individual. The\nages of the past are still with us, but they\u2019ve become a given, received\nculture, one that is taken for granted\u2014its issues and contentions are largely\nsettled debate, but remain relevant. Past ages become social and cultural\nfoundations\u2014but just like a buildings\u2019 foundation, they are more ossified and\nunchanging. The hegemonic age, however, dominates in its effects on daily\nlife, it organizes social institutions, it\u2019s open to continual evolution and\ndebate, and is always changing and dynamic.\n\nChart of time and history\n\nThe Age of Gods & Men is the period before prehistory. It is accessible only\nthrough the archeological record and surviving oral traditions. This is a\nperiod in which nature recurs with time, the coming and going of the seasons\nand celestial bodies. This is a Mythic society prior to the mastery of\nlanguage. Mythic society was a directly lived experience, created by their own\ndirect actions, one in which all individuals directly participated\u2014by\nnecessity. The hegemonic temporality associated with this age was Cyclical\ntime. Cyclical time shaped peoples understanding of time as they encountered\nnaturally cyclical conditions, repeated along every moment of their nomadic\njourney with the seasons and according to the migratory patterns of wild game\nand local flora. The spatial modality of this period is characterized by\nterritories that were undifferentiated and therefore uniform\u2014that is to say,\nhunter-gatherers didn\u2019t stay in a single territory long enough to shape their\nenvironment. This age applied to human societies until the invention of\nagriculture, animal husbandry, and the emergence of subsistence farming.\n\nThe Age of Cyclical Nature is characterized as a time that is proto-\nhistorical. When agriculture began, communities invested labor into the land,\nThe Clearing (die Lichtung) is Heidegger\u2019s concept of the open space where\nDasein creates themselves.clearing^8 it for planting and imbuing it with\ncontent. This attached the community to space, and therefore enclosed the\ncommunity within cultivated property\u2014one surrounded by a differentiated region\nof uncultivated lands. This was a shift from the nomadic seasonal cycle,\nreturning people to undifferentiated but similar places and a familiar set of\ngestures in time (planting, harvesting, etc) that were attached to a single\nplace. Agrarian society generated the spatial modality of \u201cdifferentiated\nproperty\u201d and \u201cundifferentiated lands\u201d. The transition from the pastoral\nnomadism of the Age of Gods & Men to settled agriculture marked the end of an\nidle and unattached freedom, and the beginning of labor. The Agrarian society\nand agricultural mode of production is governed by the rhythm of the seasons,\nand as such is the implementation of Cyclical time in its fullest development.\n\nThe Age of Kings emerged from the practice of permanent agricultural\nsettlements, and the growth of cities.^9 The Age of Kings is characterized by\nthe division of social classes, each specializing in a different aspect of the\ntotal production of society: farmers, warriors, priests, and the nobility. The\nnobility organized social labor on the basis of the accumulation of wealth in\nthe form of Surplus value during the Age of Kings was the total amount of crop\nremaining after farmers fed themselves and paid taxes.surplus value. This\nclass appropriated the temporal surplus value that resulted from the\nexploitation of the farming class. Surplus time was invested into the\ndevelopment of a new form of power: the control of spatial territory and the\ndevelopment of history that was at the sole discretion of the nobility. The\ndevelopment of history is a new form of power controlled by the nobility over\nthe direction, management, and recording of historical time. This is a power\ninaccessible to the laboring and agrarian classes. This power is most visible\nin the historical chronicle\u2014a story narrating the events deemed most\nsignificant to the ruling class, and often the only recorded history until the\ninvention of the printing press. The nobility used this instrument to\nestablish the forward progression of their historical time by recording its\npast with writing. Mythical time is the realization of the historical\nchronicles of the nobility that has developed autonomously and as a separate\nsphere of abstracted reality from natural reality. This was the case with\nChina and Egypt, who held a monopoly on the immortality of the soul, and the\nearliest of their famous dynasties are built upon Debord 2021.imaginary\nreconstructions of the past. The rulers of these empires, as the owners of the\nprivate property of history\u2014protected by a mythical past, make use of myth to\nprove the legitimacy of their claim to rule. The intention is to be understood\nas the earthly execution of Mythic commandments would later be repurposed by\nreligion to continue underwriting the control of power in the spiritual\ndomain, best exemplified by the Holy Roman Empire.mythic commandments. The\nmore they claimed historical ownership over time and tied it to their own\nmythical chronicles, the more they legitimated their control over power.\n\nThe development of mythical history began with the administration of kingdoms\nthat went hand-in-hand with the invention of writing. Mythical history gives\ntime an orientation, a direction, and imbues it with meaning and significance.\nThe emergence of history necessitated a development beyond Mythical time to\nthe temporality of Irreversible time. The linear trajectory of irreversible\ntime presupposes endless economic development linked to the production of\nsurplus value, the Lowercase c-capital in this instance can take the form of\nmoney, labor, and time.control of this value in the form of capital, and the\npolitical management of the resulting power. Irreversible time is oriented\naround the succession of the nobility, and its measure of progress is\ndetermined by the number of successful successions. The Age of Kings was a\nprofoundly Historical society in that social organization was underwritten by\nhistory. It was during this age that history had increasing proximity to\neveryday existence but the possibility of individual participation grew more\nelusive. Individuals living in this historical society experienced lived\nmoments as mediated through the nobility or God as facilitator, since the\nnobility had sole possession of The conception of duty has been a means used\nby the holders of power to induce others to live for the interest of their\nmasters, rather than for their ownhow individuals\u2019 time was used and\nallocated\u2014so called \u2018duty\u2019.^10 The nobility were the only ones to be in a\nposition to have knowledge of, and experience the enjoyment of directly lived\nevents, while those in the city spectate upon what is essentially a conflict\nover power\u2014witnesses to a story that is not their own; which is to say, they\nwere mere spectators, alienated from directing the most important events that\ndefine their lives, and destined to be forgotten. In order for the\nirreversible time of history to cohere in the collective memory of\nindividuals, there needed to be participation in these officially recorded\nevents (as it was their duty). The wealth accumulated by the nobility was\nexpended on lavish feasts and festivals\u2014best exemplified by the \u2018bread &\ncircuses\u2019 comes from Juvenal, a Roman poet active in the Second Century AD.\nThe phrase is a critique of the political class who deliver not public\nservices or policy, but instead public diversions, distractions, or other\nmeans of appeasing the populace with trivial or base appeals to amusement or\nother simple pleasures that make no lasting change or improvements to\nsociety.bread & circuses of the Roman Empire^11 that created fleeting moments\nof participatory lived experience mediated by the nobility. The major events\nof this period culminated in the Crusades.The resulting participation in these\nevents is a recognition amongst individuals as the possessors of a unique\npresent, a period defined by the richness of their own actions, and a home\nbuilt by their own (mediated) experience. For members of the historical\nsociety, irreversible time truly exists, and within it they create memories of\ntheir own history as well as the emergence of a newfound fear of being\nforgotten into the oblivion of cyclical time. The spatial modality of this age\nwas the control of territory, and the weapon of choice was, for the first\ntime, the written word. Ironically, the power of the nobility was legitimated\nby claims (familial or fictional) to a mythical past. It was during this age\nthat E.g. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism.monotheistic religions\ndeveloped and made a compromise between myth and history\u2014one that bridged the\ngap between cyclical time (as it dominated the sphere of agricultural\nproduction), and the irreversible time that was the theater of politics. The\nreligions that developed out of monotheism were the fundamental building\nblocks universally acknowledged as useful for building new historical\nsocieties based on irreversible time. It was during this age where one\u2019s life\nwas measured according to irreversible time, in the form of successive stages\nof life (childhood, adulthood, old-age), with the consideration of life as a\nvoyage, as passage without return, in a world whose meaning culminates in the\nspatial elsewhere of According to the Augustinian Proclamation, the Catholic\nChurch in Vatican City was the unitary physical space shared with Heaven\n(Augustine 1993).Heaven.^12 Individuals found the fulfillment of their\npersonal histories within the sphere of the ruling nobility. So, just as the\nnobility defined themselves by waging war over disputed power, individuals\nattached their personal historical chronicles to their rulers\u2014thus, the knight\nand his personal story is entwined with the story of duty to his king. The Age\nof Kings applies to feudal civilizations in China, Egypt, Greece, Iran, Rome,\nEurope, Japan, and Latin America.\n\nAs long as agriculture remained the primary form of labor during the Age of\nKings, cyclical time continued to constrain social life with tradition, which\ninhibited the development of irreversible time. It wasn\u2019t until the rise of\nmercantilism that the bourgeoisie emerged, challenging the monopoly on\nirreversible time.^4^13 It was only then that the irreversible time of the\nbourgeois economy was brought to bear upon the remaining vestiges of cyclical\ntime, eradicating it at every encounter across the globe. As the bourgeoisie\ngained control over irreversible time, their labor gradually became a project\nto transform historical conditions.^4 The bourgeoisie was the first ruling\nclass for which labor became a valuable commodity. With the gradual abolition\nof all nobility, social privileges, and titles, they recognize value only from\nthe exploitation of labor, and have identified the control of the commoditized\nbody of labor as their primary form of capital. These developments culminated\nin the emergence of the Age of Economic Production.\n\nThe Age of Economic Production is characterized by working conditions that\nwere the dominant zeitgeber of daily life. This age emerged during the\nenlightenment and prefigured the industrial revolution with the inventions of\nthe printing press and the clock tower. Irreversible time limited\nparticipation to the nobility up until the period of the The bourgeois\nrevolutions include the English Civil War (1642-1651), the American War of\nIndependence (1775-1799), the French Revolution (1789-1799), the European\nrevolutions of 1830 and 1848, and the unification movements in Germany and\nItaly.bourgeois revolutions. During this age, irreversible time developed into\nits generalized form\u2014the inevitable unfolding of events for themselves,\ncrushing any individual in its path. This was the emergence of the temporality\nof Chronological time: a progression of time marked by the unfolding events of\nthe commodity, and controlled its market imperatives. This is a time of clocks\nthat is measurable, ordered, countable, and structured. The bourgeoisie, as\nrulers of the economy and specialists in the ownership of commodities,\nuntethered history from the administration of the state and privileged the\nmanagement of the economy. Increasing literacy and the historical power\nunleashed by the proliferation of the printing press democratized and\ndiminished the hegemony of irreversible time. Individuals participated in the\nproduction and consumption of commodities, which was formerly limited to the\nnobility.^4 It was during the later part of this age that capitalism developed\nacross the globe, universalizing chronological time as a singular history that\nprogresses the same everywhere at once. This is a time belonging to the\nglobalized marketplace. The spatial modality of this age was migration, where\nmigrant labor was the major factor in human movement. People lived where they\nworked, migrations were predicated on moving to locations with improved\nworking conditions. Proximity to work, as well as citizenship and residential\nstatus determined access to employment. In the United States, young people\nmoved from familial support networks to cities with better jobs. Space was a\nconstraining factor in this age, where proximity to arts & culture limited\nwhat individuals could watch and listen to. The city was the locality of the\narts. The conception of utopia during this age was increasingly secular and\nsocially constructed, resulting in the development of liberal democracy and\nsocialism. It was during this age that the concept of leisure emerged as the\ntemporality of Consumable time. Consumable time is the colonizer of non-\nworking time. It is relegated to a subservient role as a gift that presupposes\nlabor rather than as equal to chronological time\u2014it is free time that is\nlegitimated by work, but not free in the sense of freedom. To maintain these\ncomplementary roles, consumable time finds itself laden with false\nattributions of value, and these moments are segmented into a sequence of\nartificially distinct events, which are merely undifferentiated moments of\ntime perceived to be In consumable time, the weekend is perceived as more\nvaluable than the weekdays, and the general sentiment that Mondays are worse\nthan Fridays. These moments of consumable time are perceived to be more\nvaluable since the worker is able to consume this time freely.more highly\nvaluable.^4\n\nThe Age of the Autonomous Spectacle is the ultimate realization of the The\n\u2018End of History\u2019 is a political and philosophical concept that supposes that a\nparticular political, economic, or social system may develop that would\nconstitute the end-point of humanity\u2019s sociocultural evolution. A number of\nwriters have argued that a particular system is the end of history including\nThomas More in Utopia, G. W. F. Hegel, Karl Marx, Vladimir Solovyov, Alexandre\nKoj\u00e8ve, and Francis Fukuyama in his 1992 book, The End of History and the Last\nMan. Papa\u00efoannou is more optimistic, saying \u201ca time of [historical] arrest is\nnot the end of time\u201d, argues that it can contain the potential for new futures\n(Papa\u00efoannou 2012, p. 97).End of History^14^15\u2014a refusal of the progression of\nany major historical divergence from our extant social organization and\ntemporalities. It is an indefinite postponement of the future. This is an age\ncharacterized by commodities that exist for their own sake, external to any\nhuman desires, or even society itself. This is an age where the economy\nbecomes autonomous\u2014organizing social activity in order to reproduce itself.^16\nThis age was inaugurated with the publishing of Propaganda, was written by\nEdward Bernays in 1928, incorporated the literature from social science and\npsychology for the techniques of public communication for the manipulation of\nthe masses. (Bernays 2005).Propaganda^17 in 1928^18, it developed with the\nubiquity of television and radio. It was formally declared when Margret\nThatcher announced \u201cThere is no alternative\u201d (TINA) is a political slogan\narguing that capitalism is the only viable system of social organization. It\nwas used by Margaret Thatcher in a speech. Together with Ronald Reagan, they\nbegan the era of neoliberal austerity and laissez-faire globalization. \u201cThere\nis no alternative to capitalism\u201d.^19 , and echoed by David Cameron: The age\nfinally materialized with the fall of the Berlin Wall, when all alternatives\nto capitalism ceased to exist.\n\nThe temporal modality of this age is Spectacular time, with the perception of\ntime itself as a consumable commodity. Spectacular time is generalized across\nthe globe as a repetition of the same day, a Groundhog Day^20, spectacular\ntime is a uniform and equal amount of time fully allocated to the production\nand consumption of commodities, and the reproduction of itself. This is a time\nthat can only be organized by the specialized interest groups who own the\nproduction of commodities. Just as irreversible time was democratized during\nthe Age of Economic Production, the Age of the Autonomous Spectacle\ndemocratizes chronological time by granting individuals the ability to create\nand consume commodities in the general economy (whereas it was once limited to\nthe social elite). This is participation with the historical record, albeit\nlimited to the production and consumption of commodities that increasingly\nbecomes the totality of lived experience.\n\nIt is during this age that social media allowed individuals to participate in\nhistory The celebrity is the contemporary class that was formerly the role of\nthe bourgeoisie, the ruling class, or the nobility\u2014the appearance of the\ncontrol of power and influence: The Influencer.as celebrity by \u2018going viral\u2019\neither among their peers, or more broadly. This is an ephemeral participation\nin history however, as the attention\u2014or gaze of the public\u2014is distracted by\nthe continual onslaught of spectacular memes. Individual subjects of the viral\nevent are quickly subsumed by the global flows of the attention economy that\nexpands autonomously according to market imperatives. This commoditized form\nof time segments moments into spectacular time and Pseudo-cyclical time.\nSpectacular time is the equivalent of work, and pseudo-cyclical time is its\u2019\ncorresponding free-time. Pseudo-cyclical time is perceived to have more\nintrinsic value than working time\u2014work is the so-called \u2018real life\u2019 the worker\nmust endure. The consumption of these images (media broadly: internet, tv,\nnews, magazines, apps, even academic publications) serve as further\nadvertisements for all other commodities.Any surplus pseudo-cyclical time is\nincreasingly allocated to the consumption of images, deepening the immersion\nin Spectacle is a pervasive system of mediation that alienates individuals\nfrom authentic social interactions and experiences. It is not merely about\npassive consumption of media but encompasses the entire fabric of society,\nincluding politics, culture, and everyday life where reality becomes\nfragmented and commodified, with images and representations serving as a\nsubstitute for genuine human relationships and directly lived experiences\n(Debord 2021).Spectacle. This time is the realm of the commodity, and the\nimages are the medium with which these commodities act upon our consciousness\nmost efficiently. This is the realm of the attention economy, a battlefield\nfrom which the Spectacle mounts its strongest attack. The ultimate goal of\nthis attack is to maintain our attention upon the Spectacle itself, and to\nincrease the time allocated to the consumption of spectacular events. Whereas\npower in the Age of Economic Production was determined by nation-states, who\nmade their power legible by drawing territorial boundaries, and defining\nresidents and aliens\u2014the Age of the Autonomous Spectacle is one where power is\ndetermined by attention, and space is no longer relevant.\n\nThe invention of the smartphone is the key development (after the emergence of\nthe internet) that established the ubiquity of spectacular time and\ncyberspace. The smartphone locates us on the internet all the time. We\npreviously went to the place of the internet and took things away with us, but\nsmartphones push us over a threshold where we need to opt-out of Named\n\u2018cyberspace-time\u2019, cf. Fisher 2020 00:08:30.spectacular time. With the\ninternet in our hands, in the ubiquitous non-place of cyberspace\u2014we\u2019ve lost\nthe ability to opt-out.^21 Airspace is a term coined by Kyle Chayka (Chayka\n2016).Airspace^22 is the spatial modality of this age: the universal realm of\nthe global market, where local goods, cultures and the places themselves are\nmade accessible to the market, each comparable and homogeneous to better\nconform to the ease of exchange\u2014and therefore lacking any semblance of its\nonce unique character.^4 Airspace is a banalizing and homogenizing force\nacross the globe\u2014where the same tertiary services appear everywhere as workers\ntravel the world demanding the same familiar experiences, creating a banal\nnowhere.^22 This can be seen happening simultaneously, with the reproduction\nof the same coffee shops, stores, languages, restaurants, styles, and customs\nacross the globe. The emergence of Airspace corresponds with the success of\nnon-location companies like McDonalds, Starbucks, Airbnb, Uber & Lyft, Zoom\nand VPNs are technologies that negate space itself, as well as the need to\ntravel.Zoom, and VPNs. Workers are no longer tied to their localities, cities,\nor even countries. Workers can move to their hometowns, move in with families,\nor move abroad in order to change their working conditions. In this age, the\nnation-state becomes a barrier to free trade, a barrier to the worker trying\nto optimize their working conditions. With the obsolescence of the nation-\nstate, corporate power comes to the fore. Corporations are the dominant\nzeitgeber in the daily lives of individuals. They provide the infrastructure\nfor wages, health care, perks, and even define when, where, and who people\nsocialize with. The corporation is the predominant institution that organizes\nsociety. The rise of corporate sociality is built upon the graveyard of\ncommunity. The ideal worker in the Age of the Autonomous Spectacle is the\nknowledge worker, the self-starter, who has paid for their own training and\nwhose primary task is to produce their own psyche: an The achievement-subject\nrefers to individuals who have transitioned from being obedience-subjects in a\ndisciplinary society to entrepreneurs of themselves in an achievement society.\nThese individuals are driven by a task-oriented compulsion towards constant\nproductivity, self-improvement, and overachievement. They are guided by a\npositive social milieu that emphasizes \u201cYes, we can\u201d. This condition\nultimately leads to anxiety, exhaustion, burnout, and depression (Han\n2015).achievement-subject^23 who is expected to have little inputs and produce\nmaximum outputs, with little management, and produce surplus value that\nconsistently goes beyond \u2018meets expectations\u2019.\n\n## Temporalities of Time\n\nThe perception of time is a fluid modality of human thought. A temporality is\na collective psychology that dominates the whole mass of society.^24 These\npsychologies shift across periods of time and space, much like an age, a\ntemporality is more keenly felt in the city than in the country. One\ntemporality comes to the fore as another recedes, but one is always more\ndominant. The dominant temporality of any society is determined by its stage\nof human social development. During the Age of Cyclical Nature, time was\nhumanized and therefore any individual was able to participate in the\nhistorical events of their own time. After the emergence of irreversible time,\nthe individual could no longer meaningfully participate in the lived\nhistorical events of their own period, as those events are no longer\ncontrolled by those at the base of society.\n\nCyclical time directly confronts naturally cyclical conditions, repeating with\nthe seasons and according to the patterns of local flora and fauna. It is a\nperception of time as the passage of the labors of a people in sync with\nnaturally occurring transitions.\n\nMythical time is perceptually the same as Cyclical time, but underwritten by a\nclaim to ownership of that time by a nobility that has taken ownership of the\nhistorical record.\n\nIrreversible time is the perception of time as a linear series of events and\ndevelopments occurring in the realm of war, economics, technology, knowledge,\nand yet limited to the personal chronicles of the nobility. It is qualitative.\nIrreversible time is a temporality whereby the ruling class records their\npersonal histories with narratives\u2014those personal events, conquests, wars,\nbattles, and the administration of their kingdom. Irreversible time is the\nofficial time that is contested in clashes between foreign lands. Irreversible\ntime is thus alien to ordinary individuals, something they don\u2019t seek out and\nsomething from which they had thought they were protected from. These events\nmark changes in the historical record that provide a framework for individuals\nto understand their place within that history.\n\nThe early ages we\u2019ve described each correspond to a single temporality. In the\nlater two ages (the Age of Economic Production and the Age of the Autonomous\nSpectacle, respectively) two temporalities emerge that exist simultaneously.\nOne of these temporalities always corresponds to the In Debordian terms, \u2018time\nof production\u2019 (Debord 2021).time spent working and one corresponds to\nvalorized time (free time that is highly valued by individuals). Individuals\nexperience these temporalities distinctly, and oscillate between them on a\nday-to-day basis.\n\nWorking time| Valorized time  \n---|---  \nAge of Economic Production| Chronological time| Consumable time  \nAge of the Autonomous Spectacle| Spectacular time| Pseudo-cyclical time  \n  \nChronological time is linear and quantitative. It is segmented, measurable,\nordered, and counted. It is the time of clocks, of hours, minutes, seconds,\nmilliseconds.^25 Chronological time is the Chronos, it is scheduled and\nplanned in advance, knowable and quantitative.^26 It is the time of work.^4\nChronological time atomizes the moment, Equivalent time where every interval\nis equivalent in value and therefore indistinguishable as abstracted units of\ntime, which are, in reality, merely their use value for exchangeability\n(Debord 2021).where every interval is equivalent in value and therefore\nindistinguishable.^4 Chronological time has no duration, and produces no\nmemory, it is unmemorable time but not forgotten\u2014it is always inscribed into\nthe historical record. Chronological time is understood as a sequence of the\nsame uneventful \u2018nows\u2019 that repeat over and over again to the point where each\nworking day is interchangeable with the next. Chronological time is the\ncomplement to consumable time, and the opposite of Lived time.\n\nDebord uses the term \u2018Pseudo-cyclical time\u2019 when discussing the freely\nconsumable time of the worker that is the compliment of time spent\nworking.Consumable time is the time returned to social life as a by-product of\nthe work accomplished during chronological time^4. Consumable time is\nchronological time disguised so it may be consumed freely by workers. It\nexhibits the same characteristics, namely equally segmented, fungible units of\ntime\u2014the qualitative dimensions of which are suppressed in favor of\nquantitative equality. Since this time is the complementary by-product of\nwork, it therefore maintains the hegemony and legitimacy of work. It is a\ncommoditized version of Lived time.\n\nSign reads \"NO IDLING\" besides a doorway into a building.\n\nSpectacular time is the ultimate realization of the End of History\u2014a refusal\nof the progression of any major historical divergence or change to the\ndominant temporality. It changes our perception of time, Twitter is the\nperfect example of a \u2018screaming low-level panic\u2019 (Fisher, 2020).creating a\npanic-temporality.^21 It enforces a state of constant anxiety akin to\nentrepreneurialism, a form of precarity where we are compelled to continually\nhustle and market ourselves even when we have stable jobs. This temporality\nappears across the globe as a repetition of the same day, a uniform and equal\namount of time fully allocated to the production and consumption of\ncommodities, and the reproduction of Spectacle. In spectacular time, we never\nhave the time to sit back and think, to plan for the future\u2014all time has been\naccounted for, and the future has been foreclosed. This is a time that can\nonly be organized by the specialized interest groups who own the production of\nthose commodities. Spectacular time is an objective religion with dogma,\nritual, and the imposition of scripture as fact\u2014these take the form of best\npractices, productivity optimizations, and quantified success, respectively.\nThis isn\u2019t a subjective religion that is lived and felt, but one that\ncolonizes life. It is a religion that is submitted to from the external\ndoctrines of the economy.\n\nPseudo-cyclical time is the complement to spectacular time, a time valorized\nfor the \u2018free consumption\u2019 by the workers in the Age of the Autonomous\nSpectacle. Pseudo-cyclical time is experienced as cyclical time, returning to\nthe The natural zeitgebers are the cyclical rhythms of cyclical time: day and\nnight, the procession of the seasons, the intervals of farm work, the cycle of\nharvests, festivals, and holidays.zeitgebers that regulated the intervals of\npre-industrial societies. It builds upon the vestiges of cyclical time as a\nfoundation and generates new variations: day and night, weekly work and\nweekend rest, and the cycle of fashions, television shows, holidays, and\nperiodic vacations. It is defined by the continuation of the rationality of\nthe enlightenment combined with the demand for data that arose out of the\nattention economy. Pseudo-cyclical time is itself a consumable commodity, one\nwhich has combined all aspects of the social life which were formerly\nseparate: private life, economic life, and political life. This combined time\nof contemporary society is the raw material to be consumed by the worker\nhowever they see fit, but only as inputs to a set of ever-expanding products\non the market of socially controlled schedules of the attention economy.\n\nThere are two more temporalities, these are the unmemorable, the unaccounted\nfor, and therefore the untheorized. These two temporal domains are the\nwilderness of time, at once wild sites of potential and yet vulnerable to\ncommodification.\n\nReproductive time is the time used to reproduce the worker every day. This is\nthe time required to acquire daily food, clothing, and shelter. It is the\nlived experience of commuting, doing chores, cooking, and eating. It accounts\nfor adequate rest and sleep, maintaining one\u2019s health, childcare,\nrelationships, and community. It is the equivalent to the time spent surviving\nin nature\u2014foraging for food, searching for shelter, but set in a modern\nmilieu\u2014shopping, chores, and conducting economic transactions. Reproductive\ntime is always subject to the dominant time of its age, be that irreversible\ntime, chronological time, or spectacular time. The economy considers\nreproductive time as a secondary concern. As such, health, aging, and\nchildcare are continually sidelined by the economy as externalities that have\nno bearing on the production of products and services. Reproductive time is\npresented as the realm of the domestic, as feminine, and as such is considered\ninvisible and intuitive\u2014which is to say, lacking in thought and rigor.^27\nReproductive time is, in fact, the opposite\u2014 To quote Marx describing the\nrevolutionary proletarian: \u2018I am nothing and I should be everything.\u2019 (Marx\n1975, p. 254).it produces the visible workforce, and a lot of emotion and\nthought is put into care for the people who become the fundamental basis of\nthe economy.^27 According to Angela Garbes: Garbes 2022, p. 14.\"Love and care,\nlike social change, are slow and follow circuitous paths that take days not\nhours, years not months. The work may seem inefficient, but love doesn\u2019t play\nby the same rules as the economy.\"^27 While work is perceived as \u2018apart from\nlife\u2019, and \u2018free time\u2019 remains perceived as \u2018more authentically real life\u2019,\nthe lived experience of reproductive time is cut off from \u2018real life\u2019,\nremaining undocumented and unaccounted for on any personal narrative. This\ndeprives daily life of language and as a formal concept, and it lacks any\nanalysis of what events occurred within its own past. Reproductive time is the\nreal time of life, but one that is misunderstood, smothered, and forgotten\u2014to\nthe benefit of the false consciousness of spectacular time that is the memory\nof the unmemorable.^4 Reproductive time is the primary site of recuperation by\nneoliberal capitalism as it continues to colonize this time. It appears across\nthe globe with the defunding of any social services that support reproductive\ntime. Concrete examples of this include the defunding of public education and\nthe increase of private schools and private childcare; the increase in the\ncosts of college education, the politicization-of & elimination-of\nreproductive healthcare; the increase in health insurance costs and its\ndecreasing coverage; the reduction of subsidized food and housing programs;\nthe privatization of health services such as the NHS in the UK, and the\nconsolidation of hospitals and outpatient clinics in the US. These reductions\ncome at the expense of workers, and the costs are borne by workers in terms of\nboth time and money. The ideological goal of these actions is twofold: shift\nthe burden of reproductive time onto workers by eliminating services and\nshifting them to the private domain while corporations capture increasing\nprofits by decreasing operational costs.\n\nI chose to use Debordian term \u2018Lived time\u2019 because it has the connotation of\nactually living. Other have used the Greek word \u2018kairos\u2019 to describe such\nmoments, see Odell 2023.Lived time is the freest, most fun, most creative mode\nof time experienced.^4 Lived time is the Kairos^26\u2014those nonlinear and\nqualitative moments that dynamically stretch and contract with our emotions,\nengage all our senses, and requires full participation. Lived time are those\nKnown as \u2018ecstatic time\u2019 in Being and Time, the word comes from the Greek\n\u00e9kstasis\u2014to be \u2018outside of oneself\u2019. See Heidegger 1962.moments of ecstasy\nexperienced during leisure, play, focus, intense emotions, and erotic\nrapture.^8 It is a time experienced without the awareness of time passing.\nLived time are those moments when we do something for the hell of it, escaping\nthe rigid order of the schedule. Lived time is a The \u2018space of play\u2019 is\nGraeber\u2019s term for a distinction between play and games, where play is free,\ncreative, and open-ended, while games are rigid, repetitive, and closed-off.\nGraeber suggested that play underlies art, science, conversation, and\ncommunity, while games are the preferred method of bureaucracy. He emphasized\nthat the key distinction between games and play is the presence of rules, with\ngames being defined by their rules, while play is defined by its lack of rules\n(Graeber 2015).space of play that is free, creative, and open-ended.^28\nAthletes, artists, and creatives have converged on describing this time as \u201ca\nstate of flow\u201d\u2014a total state of immersion in activity. Lived time is\nunhurried, a time in which people can pursue their own projects, at their own\npace. These projects may not lead to a predetermined goal, but gradually\nbecome unto themselves, absent a goal\u2014done for their own sake. When we say we\n\u201chave lost track of time\u201d, it is often due to the experience of lived time.\nThe feeling of lived time at its most intense can be depersonalizing, we only\nrealize how absorbed we are when we emerge from it. Lived time is never\nscheduled and always late. It is here where we abandon the utility-value of\ntime as money, and it is where past, present and future coalesce into\nduration^25\u2014the perception of memorable times distilled into a narrative that\nchronicles one\u2019s life. Lived time is fundamentally useless, ephemeral,\ndisposable, and therefore cherished\u2014that singular characteristic beyond value.\nLived time is experienced for its own sake\u2014not guided by instrumentality or\nutility. It is a time that uniquely gives us a sense of our own mortality.^25\n\n## Instrumentarianism and The Perpetual Present\n\nThe Perpetual Present is our contemporary social milieu\u2014a period without\nduration that never changes, it is a temporality where the past is irrelevant,\nand The Perpetual Present is the reification of time itself.the present moment\nis spent determining a future that isn\u2019t our own. Unlike the circle in the\ncyclical time of nature, and the line in the irreversible time of history, the\nperpetual present is a point of singularity collapsed into a time we call\n\u2018now\u2019. The perpetual present is the period at the End of History.\n\nIt's Always Now: Image of an analog clock face with 'Now' at every hour.\n\nThe The autonomous economy is an economy which has shifted from the\nsatisfaction of human needs to the generation of pseudo-needs in for its own\nsake, external to any human desire, or even society itself, organizing reality\nin order to reproduce itself.autonomous economy privileges the perpetual\npresent which is concentrated as a cascade of urgent \u2018nows\u2019 that bury the past\nand obscure the future. There is no felt duration between past and future when\nthe now is in ubiquitous crisis. The ubiquity of this temporality creates a\ndominant social order\u2014one in which we \"scurry to meet the demands of our\nquantitative culture.\"^25 Our lives increasingly exist in the perpetual\npresent, where moments are sold according to the ticking of the clock. Time is\nmoney, time is getting things done, and yet, at the end of the day we cannot\naccount for where our time went. A society dominated by continual busyness is\na social life that is permanently anxious and \u201cIt\u2019s easier to imagine the end\nof the world than the end of capitalism\u201d a quote attributed to Fredric Jameson\nand Slavoj \u017di\u017eek (Fisher 2009).too distracted to imagine a future.^29^30 The\nperpetual present is haunted , according to Mark Fisher, by \"lost futures that\nthe twentieth century taught us to anticipate... the disappearance of the\nfuture meant the deterioration of a whole mode of social imagination: the\ncapacity to conceive of a world radically different from the one in which we\ncurrently live. It meant the acceptance of a situation in which culture would\ncontinue without really changing.\"^31 This is a society deeply networked by\nsmartphones, and an onslaught of tasks that ruthlessly undermine any sense\nthat time can \u2018congeal\u2019 due to informational saturation. The more information\nwe are exposed to, the more we are subject to the durationlessness of the\nperpetual present, and our focus narrows onto specific instrumental\nobjectives.^25 This instrumental attention prioritizes time solely as a means\nto attain certain ends: we allocate time for tasks essential to perceived\nsurvival, tethering our actions to the ticking of the clock. This gives us a\ndiminished sense of duration, and therefore diminished memory\u2014a society of\namnesiacs in pursuit of productivity for its own sake, in service to an\neconomy that operates for its own sake. In the perpetual present we are all\nLeonard, the protagonist in the 2001 film Memento.\n\nThe tattoos on Leonard's body serve as a todo list to help him work despite\nhis amnesia.\n\nCf. Nolan 2001Here\u2019s the thing. You see, I haven\u2019t told you about his\ncondition.^32\n\nLeonard has anterograde amnesia, a result of a violent home invasion that left\nhim injured and his wife dead. The traumatic memory of this murder drives\nLeonard\u2019s quest for revenge. Despite his condition, Leonard is portrayed as\nsmart, determined, and capable. He is the exemplar of the achievement-subject:\nsomeone focused on achievement for its own sake, the task of increased\nachievement. Leonard exists in a perpetual present brought on by amnesia.\nSpoilers: once he has gotten his revenge, he must answer for himself: What is\nnext, and to what end? To this, he refuses to answer, and instead changes his\nown memory by editing the notes that document his own past. His perpetual\npresent is constructed with lies and selective memory. He continues his task\nbeyond completion, beyond achievement. Leonard is the achievement-subject\ntaken to its logical conclusion.\n\nOur perception of the perpetual present exhibits two key characteristics.\nFirstly, time is exclusively tied to the fleeting and present moment.\nSecondly, this present moment becomes illusory, infinitely divisible, and\nladen with an ever-expanding array of tasks\u2014becoming infinite. Pursuing this\nlogic leads to the imposition of an unattainable burden, resulting in\nwidespread anxiety and burnout.^23\n\nLeonard\u2019s amnesia inoculates him from burnout. Without memory, without any\nmeaningful sense of the past, Leonard maintains an infinite state of\nproductivity without burnout. The TV show Severance expands upon this idea,\nwhere employees volunteer to have their brains surgically segmented, thus\nsplitting one\u2019s work life from their personal life\u2014they, quite literally, have\nno memory of their workday. The procedure is legitimated as beneficial to\nmental health, and its\u2019 effect produces a docile, burnout-free workforce.^33\n\nWe are all Leonard in the perpetual present that is continually demanding\n\u2018more\u2019. More things to do, more tasks to complete, more labor to be expended,\nmore psychological effort, more status to achieve\u2014nothing is ever complete,\nand nothing is ever enough.^25 We, unlike Leonard, are not immune to anxiety,\ndepression, exhaustion, and burnout. Leonard exemplifies instrumental\nattention, an attendance to goals and outcomes that is typical of the\nachievement-subject. These goals and behaviors are\u2014much like\nLeonard\u2014vulnerable to manipulation by the operant forces of Spectacle and\nsurveillance capitalism.\n\nZuboff defines surveillance capitalism as the utilization of big data, AI, and\ndata-driven technologies to subtly modify human behavior remotely and at scale\ntowards economic ends.^34 The smartphone inaugurated the era of big-data\nsurveillance and gamified behavioral modification using gadgets. Twitter\u2019s\n\u201cpull-to-refresh\u201d UI gesture that leverages variable rewards, much like a slot\nmachine, triggers addictive behavior as a way to increase user engagement with\nthe timeline. Facebook employs similar psychological methods with the \u201cred\ndot\u201d notifications that keep people checking their phone for the next new\nthing.^35 Youtube & Netflix discovered that auto-playing the related videos\ndramatically increased views.^36 Zuboff defines According to Lacan^37, the\n\u2018big Other\u2019 represents a kind of ideal observer or societal norms that\nindividuals perform for, shaping their behavior and expressions to conform to\nsocial expectations (Evans 1996). \u017di\u017eek^38 further explores this concept by\ndelving into the enigmatic nature of the \u2018big Other\u2019, questioning its demands\nand highlighting its role in shaping desires and behaviors within society\n(\u017di\u017eek 1989).\u2019Big Other\u2019 as the global physical architecture of computerized\nand networked technologies that achieve a pervasive and unprecedented means of\nbehavioral surveillance. This creates a new form of Instrumentarian power that\noperates through the manipulation of individuals\u2019 behaviors, preferences, and\nactions based on predictive data derived from technological tools\u2014ultimately\nserving the commercial interests of corporations.^34\n\nContrary to Orwellian depictions of oppressive surveillance technology that\nmaliciously watches our every move, instrumentarian power doesn\u2019t rely on\nforced control or subjugation but rather on individuals who willingly interact\nwith technology in ways that lead them to progressively disclose personal\ninformation and behaviors over time. Zuboff\u2019s Instrumentarian power aligns\nwith Debord\u2019s concept of the Integrated Spectacle in Comments on the Society\nof the Spectacle he described it as a fusion of the Diffuse and Concentrated\nforms, characterized by intensive technological development, continual\npersonal re-skilling, and an integration of state and economy that mirrors how\nsurveillance capitalism intertwines technology with economic interests to\nmonitor and influence individuals\u2019 voluntary experiences for profit. It is a\nprescient description of instrumentarian power (Debord 1998, ch. IV).\nVoluntary participation is both far more effective and efficient at subduing\nthe masses, since it appears to empower individuals through improved\nproductivity and consumer choice.^18 Technology companies leverage cloud\ncomputation, big data, artificial intelligence, and behavioral economics to\nmonitor and manipulate experiences for the purpose of commodifying users\u2019\nprivate data and attention to keep users engaged.^34 Ultimately,\ninstrumentarianism is a power over time, a unilateral claim to the future,^34\na power to sell future behaviors to advertisers\u2014all while burying the present\nin a cascade of banal trivialities.\n\n## The Rise of the Zeitzombie\n\nThe extreme busyness of the perpetual present saps us of vitality and leaves\nus without a strong sense of personal identity. We have been seduced into the\nculture of hustle & grind, we have worked so many long hours that our\nimagination is devoid of anything outside of work.\n\n> \u201dThere is a sort of dead-alive hackneyed people about, who are scarcely\n> conscious of living except in the exercise of some conventional\n> occupation.\u201d^2\n>\n> Robert Louis Stevenson An Apology for Idlers\n\nsaid Robert Louis Stevenson.

Other symptoms include a\nresistance to sociality, a fear of daydreaming, and the elimination of\nboredom.\n\nThe zeitzombie is the product of our collective proclivity to say \u2018yes\u2019, it\u2019s\nan Positivity, according to Han, is \u201cthe societal focus on positivity and\nachievement can lead to an excess of pressure and expectations, making it\ndifficult for individuals to manage negative experiences and ultimately\nresulting in burnout.\u201d (Han 2015, p. 1). Cf. Fisher 2014 who calls it a\n\u201cpermanently multitasking, permanently distracted state of being\u201d.excess of\npositivity.^23^30 As the achievement-subject, we say \u2018yes\u2019 to the urgency of\nthe perpetual present, we say \u2018yes\u2019 to performance improvements at work, we\nsay \u2018yes\u2019 to optimizing our health, we say \u2018yes\u2019 to answering late night work\nrequests, we say \u2018yes\u2019 and pickup those side jobs. According to Jenny Odell:\nOdell 2019, p. 15.\"Every waking moment has become the time in which we make\nour living... time becomes an economic resource that we can no longer justify\nspending on \u2018nothing\u2019.\"^40\n\nThere is no \u2018work-life balance\u2019 for the zeitzombie, when all of life is work:\nproducing our work, producing our bodies to better produce work, producing our\npsychologies to identify with the production of work.

Andreessen\n2023.\"man was meant to be useful, to be productive.\"^41 , in their words. For\nthe zeitzombie, there is no life outside of work, and death is a problem that\nneeds to be solved in order to guarantee future productivity. The zeitzombie\nis the techno-zealot\u2014 quoting him again, \"we believe intrinsic motivations\u2013\nthe satisfaction of building something new..., the achievement of becoming a\nbetter version of oneself\", these are the words of the achievement-subject,\ntrue believers in the coming of the Their techno-Messiah is the General\nArtificial Intelligence (AGI). \u201cWe believe Artificial Intelligence is our\nalchemy...

They are therefore compelled\nto excel beyond satisfactory in all institutional environments. This drive to\ncontinually excel and constant precarity leads to a diminished sense of life\nand yields to the simple concern for survival. This is the \u2018logic of increase\u2019\nthat subsumes all notions of a good life in the realms of work, money, health,\nknowledge, relationships, and community. This logic manifests as a fear of\nfalling down the social order that is amplified by social media as we scroll\nthrough friends\u2019 and celebrities curated image of \u201cwhat life could be\u201d.^26 The\ncondition of the zeitzombie applies equally up and down the social spectrum,\nfrom the working-poor to the Elon Musks of the world, everyone is time-poor\nwhen we all live to work.\n\n\u201dIf you work for a living, why do you kill yourself working?\u201d \u2014Tuco (From the\n1966 film \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d^43)\n\nWith the conveniences offered by smartphones, we willingly forfeit the\nseparation that work and life once had.

Vacation once meant leaving the physical place of work behind, now\nwe must ask ourselves what is vacation when you can work remotely from\nvacation? When there is no clear demarcation between work and where we are in\nspace, leisure, as it was understood, is now less definable\u2014just as the\nconcept of \u2018home\u2019 is less obvious when we work from home. That which was\nformerly private space is no longer a place of refuge.\n\nDepression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Borderline\nPersonality Disorder, and burnout are the dominant psychological pathologies\nat the beginning of the twenty-first century.^23 The zeitzombie is ultimately\na victim of a society that privatizes social problems, Fisher 2015, p.\n21.\"treating them as if they were caused only by chemical imbalances in the\nindividual\u2019s neurology and/or by their family background\u2014any question of\nsocial systemic causation is ruled out.\"^29 says Fisher. Society puts the\nresponsibility of managing social problems onto the individual as personal\nfailures. Failure to socialize, failure to manage time, failure to manage\none\u2019s own mental health\u2014and yet depression is the , according to Han: Han\n2015, p. 10.\"pathological symptom of late modern human beings failure to\nbecome himself.\"^23\n\nThus, as we forfeit our claim to time, and forfeit our claim to space, we\nforfeit our claim to memory, we forfeit our claim to life\u2014and thus we all\nbecome the zeitzombie.\n\n## Leisure as Refusal: The Power of \u2018No\u2019\n\nOver the last 40 years corresponds to the neoliberal era of economic\nderegulation that started with Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore, then Reagan in the\nUS and Thatcher in the UK; Yasuhiro Nakasone in Japan, and Deng Xiaoping in\nChina pursuing \u2018Socialism with Chinese characteristics\u2019.40 years we\u2019ve seen an\naccelerated emergence of implicit and explicit forms of negativity and\nrefusal, especially in more concentrated societies like Japan and China. The\nThe Japanese economic miracle of the 1980s was characterized by easy credit,\nunbridled speculation, and soaring asset prices, which eventually led to a\nbust in the early 1990s, resulting in a deep recession.Japanese economic\nmiracle and the subsequent stagflation of the 1990s created a challenging\nenvironment for young people, especially university and high school students,\nwho faced immense pressure to succeed in a society where work achievements\nwere hamstrung by loyalty and seniority. The intense competition and high-\npressure environment led some individuals to withdraw from society as a coping\nmechanism, resulting in the condition of the The term \u2018hikikomori\u2019 was first\nused in 1985 to describe retreat neurosis and social apathy, it originated in\nJapan and refers to a form of social withdrawal where individuals, typically\nyoung adults, isolate themselves from society for extended periods, often\nstaying at home and avoiding social interactions (0xADADA\n2003).\u5f15\u304d\u3053\u3082\u308a(hikikomori)^44. The The 996 working hour system (996\u5de5\u4f5c\u5236) in China\nrequires employees to work from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, 12 hours per day for 6\ndays per week; i.e. 72 hours per week. It is still widespread as of 2024.996\nworking hour system in China resulted in exhaustion, burnout, mental health\nconditions, and strained personal relationships among workers. This led to the\nemergence of the \u8ebalyingt\u01ceng\u5e73flatp\u00edng movement in the spring of 2021. Tang ping\nreflects a growing discontent among Chinese youth with the intense work\nexpectations and lifestyle sacrifices demanded by the dominant work culture.\nTang ping encourages individuals to \u2018lie flat\u2019, \"rotate the world 90 degrees,\nand people will discover this unspoken truth: the one who lies flat is\nstanding, and the one who stands is crawling.\"^45 Tang ping advocated for a\nrecognition of the slavery inherent to existing working conditions, and\nrejects the societal expectations tied to relentless work hours and material\nsuccess. Tang ping and its spiritual successor \u6446let itb\u01cei\u70c2rotl\u00e0n echoes the\nAmerican hippie counterculture movement of the late 1960s, and it is the\ncontemporary analog to the Quiet quitting phenomenon in the US. Quiet quitting\ngained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, where employees fulfill their\njob requirements but do not go above and beyond, rejecting the idea that work\nshould consume their lives and choosing not to exceed the expectations\noutlined in their job descriptions. They\u2019re setting boundaries, avoiding\novertime, and focusing on completing tasks within designated working hours.\n\nTo resist the dominance of spectacular time and the perpetual present, we must\ncollectively take responsibility to determine how we use time & space\u2014and to\nwhat ends, otherwise the instrumentarian power will allocate our lives to its\nown ends. To do so, we can try embracing negativity. By negativity we don\u2019t\nmean melancholy or pessimism, but rather our ability to self-determine one\u2019s\nlife by negation, or the change of what we are with a view to being or\nbecoming something else. Without negativity we do not have freedom.^23\nNeoliberal capitalism encourages human beings to be defined by activity and\naction\u2014\u2018yes I can\u2019 (an excess of positivity), often from pressures outside\nonesself. Negativity is the opposite, it is the power of \u2018No\u2019\u2014the power to\nchoose.\n\nThe power of \u2018No\u2019 is predicated upon the increases of productivity in the last\n40 years without a corresponding increase in wages or a decrease in time spent\nworking. American households are working more overall today compared to 1980,\nputting in an average of nearly 4 more weeks of work annually. This is driven\nby increased hours and weeks worked by women who have shifted from\nreproductive labor to employment.^46 This increase in productive-time yields\nsurpluses in the form of profits for corporations, and yet lost time for\nourselves. The real measure of wealth in a society that calls itself\n\u2018developed\u2019 is not money nor commodities, Marx 1973, p. 628.\"but rather,\ndisposable time\"^47 which is to say the Bunyard 2018, p. 220.\"collective\npotential to actualize qualitatively differentiated moments of lived\nexperience.\"^7 We say \u2018No\u2019 and refuse to give more time.\n\nWhen we think of time in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds, we mistake\nthese mere referents as the thing in itself\u2014which is to say, we mistake the\nmap for the territory. The result of this perception is a collection of social\nproblems caused by Odell 2023, p. 120, cf. Bergson 1944\"conceiving of the true\nnature of time as stemming from wanting to imagine discrete moments sitting\nside by side in space.\"^26^48 said Bergson. This thinking traps us into the\nanxiety of \u2018losing time\u2019, of \u2018time passing\u2019, and the loss of productivity that\nmotivates the achievement-subject to produce their own self-exploitation. Many\nof our contemporary social conditions come from auto-disciplining ourselves\ninto an inability to say \u2018No\u2019.\n\nThe power of \u2018No\u2019 allows us to move towards temporal self-determinacy. This is\ntemporal negativity, a \u2018No\u2019 to things that hijack our time, a \u2018No\u2019 to\ninstrumentarian power. The task of \u2018No\u2019 is to consciously (and collectively)\nself-determine the goal of human activity and act towards the realization of\nthat goal. The individual\u2019s concrete activity in leisure (the means) is\ndirectly connected to its own action (the ends), which is to say, it is done\nfor its own sake. This is the fulfillment of a unity between theory and\npraxis. A path forward may be to extend the collective understanding of\nleisure as a way to establish Bunyard 2018, p. 211.\"a condition of unity\nbetween conscious human agents (subject) and their own objective historical\nexistence (object)\", which is to say\u2014we can become who we want, as we want, in\nour own time.\n\nParking garage sign that commands us to 'GO SLOW'.\n\nWhat can revitalize us, is thinking. Thinking takes time that requires\nlingering, deliberating, weighing up possible alternatives, and patience. All\nthese are active forms of \u2018No\u2019 that resist attempts to turn us into passive\nbeings that obey without resistance. If we don\u2019t, we face hyperactivity and\nits consequences: anxiety, depression, exhaustion, and burnout.\n\u2018Hyperactivity\u2019 is reactionary, it blindly reacts with unthinking\nefficiency\u2014it lacks in activity since it presupposes immediacy, rather than\nreal activity of thought, which requires time, effort, and delay.^25 We can\nborrow practices from Zen meditation, where one attempts to achieve Han 2015,\np. 23.\"the pure negativity of not to\u2014that is, the void\u2014by freeing oneself from\nrushing\", from intrusive thoughts.^23 We need contemplation: the mode of\nMerrifield 2008, p. 165.holistic thinking that considers everything, the\nthinking that is the product of daydreaming, adventures in the mind,\nmeditative thinking that is often useless but done for its own sake.^49 We\nneed activity of thought\u2014the non-time of thinking without rules, without best\npractices, using intuition which brings into existence new territories of\nideas, language, and actions that could never have been predicted.\n\nTo say \u2018No\u2019 is to reject the dominant temporality and embrace time for its own\nsake, a time that is ours.\n\n\u201dDown here it\u2019s our time, it\u2019s our time down here.\u201d^50 Mikey The Goonies\n\nWhat can \u2018save\u2019 us is the revival of the sabbatical, a period of relaxation\nand observation. The sabbatical, according to the Hebrew Bible, occurs after\nsix years of planting and tending one\u2019s fields, you let them lie For more on\nfallowing, see Kuzmanovi\u0107 2024.fallow^51 on the seventh year\u2014to let them grow\nwild without harvest or tending. It is a year of rewilding of the land, just\nas we may similarly re-wild our thoughts. Farmers took sabbatical on a\nrotating basis, and other farmers pooled resources to support the farmer who\nwas observing sabbatical. The sabbatical is a period of listening, not\nspeaking; watching, not doing. It\u2019s not about refreshing oneself to improve\nfuture productivity, or reflecting on the past. It\u2019s about reorienting oneself\nto the present moment free from outside demands.\n\nWhat can \u2018save\u2019 us is idleness. Idleness and imagination are essential to our\nwellbeing, they\u2019re the wellspring of mental clarity, and the backstop for\nmemory. Idleness is the space of play, it opens a time that engages all the\nsenses and full participation. It allows for activity for its own sake,\nwithout ends or instrumental reasoning. The activity is self-determined and\nopen-ended.\n\nWhat can \u2018save\u2019 us is boredom. Boredom is the peak of mental relaxation^23 and\nacts as a gravity well for contemplation. We can turn off our smartphones and\nde-network ourselves. We can resist the mechanization of the supernormal\nstimuli, we can resist our reactionary impulses that drive social media by\nmeans of technological abstinence, it could be Orthodox and traditionally\nobservant Jews do not use lights, electrical appliances, or any other\nelectrical devices on the Sabbath (Fri night to Sat night). This is because\nusing electricity violates the biblical prohibition on performing \u201ccreative\nlabor\u201d (melachah) on the Sabbath.ceasing to use technological devices, or it\ncould be by creating spaces that are free from commercial technology.\n\nWhat can \u2018save\u2019 us is leisure. True leisure is the experience of free and\nundetermined Lived time. By free we mean freedom, a mode of living that is not\ndetermined, modes of life free from necessity and purpose.^52 This is a\nleisure that is the opposite of vacation, which became instrumentalized\nleisure, sold as a packaged product to refresh us for our next stint of work.\nLeisure provides Odell 2023, p. 106.\"a moment of perspective on the grander\nreality\"^26 where we can engage with both past and future. Through leisure we\nreanimate our sense of duration by reintroducing lived time into our lives.\nLeisure is the source of happiness, real meaningful happiness comes from the\nwhimsical, where we engage in practices and projects which are not subordinate\nto an economic imperative (those things which are trivial, superfluous, and\ngratuitous). Put simply, leisure is to luxuriate in fun.\n\nWe demand a leisure of the commune, a leisure that isn\u2019t the personal\nresponsibility of the individual, but a leisure that is a common good for all\npeople. This is leisure-as-public-park: where we Odell 2023, p. 95.\"have\ndemarcated space as one free from private ownership... free from the work of\noptimizing oneself.\"^26\n\nWhat can save us is to Never Work!\n\nWe have time, let\u2019s make it ours.\n\nThis is part of a series exploring idleness, time, attention, and lived\nexperience.\n\n  1.
