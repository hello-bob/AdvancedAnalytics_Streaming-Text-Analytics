You can't infer\nanything about how LAM does or doesn't work from this.They likely used \"kiosk\nescape\" tricks to get code exec within the box that runs the browser. Assuming\ntheir sandboxing is all set up correctly, this isn't particularly concerning,\nbut it does expose the code that runs within the sandbox for analysis. That's\nwhat we appear to have here.The attacker left behind a file named cdk.log,\nwhich is an artifact of https://github.com/cdk-team/CDK/, a container\npentesting tool. They were clearly trying to escape the sandbox and pivot to\nsomewhere more interesting, but I don't think they managed it. I think \"part\n2\" is a bluff, this is all they have (feel free to prove me wrong, lol).But\nthat doesn't mean there's nothing here. Lets look at what we do have.The most\ninteresting detail to me is a package name list in\nrepo/typescript/common/base-tsconfig.json\n\n    \n    \n    app-caod-download base-core base-fastify base-gcp base-kubernetes base-media base-mongodb base-nli base-node base-playwright base-serp cm-browsing-minion-common cm-bunny-host-common cm-bunny-host-web-common cm-preset-bunny-builder-common cm-preset-bunny-builder-next cm-preset-bunny-builder-service cm-quantum-peripheral-common cm-rabbit-common cm-rabbit-next cm-rabbit-service cm-spotify-client q-apps q-apps-common q-apps-executor q-auth q-common q-conversation-finetuning q-hole-common q-hole-next q-hole-service q-model q-proxy q-q1-common q-q1-service q-q1-test-next q-web-minion-common q-web-minion-service q-website\n\nThe only code actually present is for q-web-minion-*.What follows is my\nspeculation based on the names alone:\"q\" seems like a codename for the rabbit\ndevice (so q-hole = rabbit hole).The problem with trying to log into and\ninterface with consumer-facing services from \"the cloud\" is that you'll get IP\nrate limited, blocked as a bot, etc. It would make sense to proxy traffic back\nout through the user's device, and that's what I'd hope q-proxy is about. The\nbig downside with this is that it ~doubles latency and ~halves available\nbandwidth, magnifying any deficiencies of a flaky 4G connection. This is\nperhaps partly why their doordash demo chugged so hard. (protip to the team:\nuse a caching proxy, with SSL MitM. Detect CDN URLs and don't proxy\nthose.)This is a total stab in the dark but my guess is that bunny-host is\nwhere the LAM action happens, and bunny-builder is for LAM training.cm-\nquantum-peripheral-common might be the wrist-mounted device teased in the\nlaunch event.  \n---  \nThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:  \n  \nSign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.
