But the basic premise is...\n\nYou should create an application with a minimum of three endpoints:\n\n  * A homepage that provides information about the ring.\n  * A /next/ page that takes someone to the next site in the ring.\n  * A /previous/ page that takes someone to the previous site in the ring.\n\nThe names for each endpoint can vary by implementation.\n\nThe next and previous pages can use the Referrer HTTP header to find the site\nsomeone was visiting and then query a database to find the previous or next\npage in the webring. \"Previous\" and \"Next\" are usually defined as the sites\nwho joined the webring before and after a member.\n\nIf a visitor gets to the end of a webring, the ring should start over again,\ntaking a visitor to the first site in the webring.\n\nNote: Some webrings opt to send a visitor to a random page when visiting a\nprevious or next endpoint instead of maintaining the sequential order of the\nring. This is an implementation detail that you can consider when building a\nwebring.\n\nA webring may or may not choose to list its members in a public directory. The\nadvantage of doing so is that someone can discover many new sites on one page.\nBut, a webring\n\n## History\n\nWebRing was originally created by Sage Weil in 1994, who then sold it in 1997,\nand then promptly founded DreamHost, a popular web hosting company.\n\nFor further detail, Ray \"brisray\" Thomas dives thoroughly into this topic in\nhis article: Webring History.\n\n## Examples\n\n  * The #1 Webring List on the Internet (by Ray \"brisray\" Thomas)\n  * \ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udc8d\n  * microcast.club\n  * https://hotlinewebring.club/\n  * http://tilde.club/~harper/join.html\n\n    * Just redirects you to a random tilde.club user's page.\n  * https://www.ringsurf.com/netring/\n\n    * May have login problems.\n  * http://webringo.com/\n  * http://ben.thatmustbe.us redirects to a different website representing someone named Ben every time the domain is reloaded. (Technically a centrally controlled webring of sorts)\n  * https://webring.xxiivv.com/ - an attempt to inspire artists & developers to build their own website and share traffic among each other. The ring welcomes personalized websites such as diaries, wikis & portfilios. Code available on Github.\n  * CLMOOC web ring uses the Draupnir Webring plugin for WordPress\n  * Bolier Plate Web Ring Eleventy and Netlify template\n  * Weird Wide Webring - Your site must be unique and weird in some way. It can be the way it looks. It can be the way you write or what you write about. It can be the way it smells. It can be the way your footer is covered in feet, your sidebar has a sidebartender, or blog is spelled \"blag\". But there must be something.

Also functions very much like a related reading tool/presentation.
