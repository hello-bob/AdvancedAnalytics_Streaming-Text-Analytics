But most other big tech-related shares also dropped.\nRenesas gave up 7.3%, Tokyo Electron lost 7.8% and Sony Group Corp. declined\n3.3%.\n\nToyota Motor Corp was down 3.7%.\n\nJapan\u2019s headline inflation rate in March slowed to 2.7%, while the core-core\nindex, excluding fresh food and energy costs, moderated to 2.9%, marking the\nfirst time since November 2022 that the index fell below 3%.\n\nThe yen was slightly firmer against the U.S. dollar, with the latter falling\nto 153.80 Japanese yen from 154.64 yen.\n\nMarkets are waiting for the Japanese central bank\u2019s next move after it raised\nits benchmark interest rate last month for the first time in 17 years, ending\na longstanding policy of negative rates meant to boost the economy. But the\nrate remains near zero.\n\nElsewhere, Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 dipped 1.7% to 7,512.70. South Korea\u2019s\nKospi dropped 2.9% to 2,558.56. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng declined 1.4% to\n16,161.24, while the Shanghai Composite edged down 0.1% to 3,071.76.\n\nOvernight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 0.2% to 5,011.12 after flipping\nbetween small gains and losses through the day. The drop was slight, but it\nwas still enough to send the index to a fifth straight loss. That\u2019s its\nlongest losing streak since October, and it\u2019s sitting 4.6% below its record\nset late last month.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1% to 37,775.38, and the Nasdaq\ncomposite slipped 0.5% to 15,601.50.\n\nEquifax dropped 8.5% for one of the market\u2019s bigger losses after it reported\nweaker revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. High interest\nrates are pressuring its mortgage credit inquiry business.\n\nThe only stock to fall more in the S&P 500 was Las Vegas Sands, which sank\n8.7% even though it reported better results than expected. Analysts said\ninvestors may be worried about competition the casino and resort company is\nfacing in Macau, a southern China enclave that is one of the world\u2019s biggest\ngambling havens.\n\nHelping to offset those losses was Elevance Health, which climbed 3.2% after\nraising its profit forecast for the full year. Genuine Parts jumped 11.2% for\nthe biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the distributor of automotive and\nindustrial replacement parts reported stronger profit than analysts expected.\nIt also raised its range for forecasted profits over the full year.\n\nStocks have been struggling recently as yields in the bond market charge\nhigher. They\u2019re cranking up the pressure because investors have largely given\nup on hopes that the Federal Reserve will deliver many cuts to interest rates\nthis year.\n\nYields climbed a bit higher after more reports on Thursday showed the U.S.\neconomy remains stronger than expected.\n\nOne report said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than\neconomists expected. It\u2019s the latest sign that the job market remains solid\ndespite high interest rates.\n\nAnother report on Thursday said growth in manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic\nregion accelerated sharply, when economists were expecting a contraction.\n\nA third report said sales of previously occupied U.S. homes didn\u2019t fall by\nquite as much last month as economists expected.\n\nSimilar data, along with a string of reports showing inflation has remained\nhotter than forecast this year, have pushed top Fed officials to say recently\nthey could hold interest rates high for a while.\n\nThat\u2019s a letdown after the Fed earlier had signaled three cuts to interest\nrates could be possible this year. But Fed officials have been adamant they\nwant to be sure inflation is heading down toward their 2% target before\nlowering the Fed\u2019s main interest rate from its highest level since 2001.\n\nIn oil trading, U.S. benchmark crude rose $2.77 to $85.50 per barrel in\nelectronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the\ninternational standard, gained $3.40 to $90.51 per barrel.\n\nThe euro dropped to $1.0623 from $1.0644.\n\nSubscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and\nexecutives shaping corporate finance.
