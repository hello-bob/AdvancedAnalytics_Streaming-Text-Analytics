It suggests that much of the content online is in fact\nautomatically generated, and that the number of humans on the web is dwindling\nin comparison with bot accounts.\n\nNow a new report from cyber security company Imperva suggests that it is\nincreasingly becoming true. Nearly half, 49.6 per cent, of all internet\ntraffic came from bots last year, its \u201cBad Bot Report\u201d indicates.\n\nThat is up 2 per cent in comparison with last year, and is the highest number\never seen since the report began in 2013.\n\nIn some countries, the picture is worse. In Ireland, 71 per cent of internet\ntraffic is automated, it said.\n\nSome of that rise is the result of the adoption of generative artificial\nintelligence and large language models. Companies that build those systems use\nbots scrape the internet and gather data that can then be used to train them.\n\nSome of those bots are becoming increasingly sophisticated, Imperva warned.\nMore and more of them come from residential internet connections, which makes\nthem look more legitimate.\n\n\u201cAutomated bots will soon surpass the proportion of internet traffic coming\nfrom humans, changing the way that organizations approach building and\nprotecting their websites and applications,\u201d said Nanhi Singh, general manager\nfor application security at Imperva. \u201cAs more AI-enabled tools are introduced,\nbots will become omnipresent.\u201d\n\nThe widespread use of bots has already caused problems for online services\nsuch as X, formerly known as Twitter. Popular posts on the site are now hit by\na huge number of comments from accounts advertising pornography, and the\ncompany appears to be struggling to limit them.\n\nRecently, its owner Elon Musk said that the site would start charging users to\nsend posts and interact with others. That was the only way of stopping the\nproliferation of automated accounts, he said.\n\nBut X is far from the only site to be hit by automated content that is posing\nas real. Many similar posts are spreading across Facebook and TikTok, for\ninstance.\n\n## Join our commenting forum\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see\ntheir replies\n\nComments\n\n### 1/1Humans share the web equally with bots, amid fears of \u2018dead internet\u2019\n\n### Humans share the web equally with bots, amid fears of \u2018dead internet\u2019\n\nGetty Images\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
