But he\u2019s perceptive enough to have picked up\non my lukewarm commitment to being interviewed, and so I felt a need to\nexplain that there are already quite a few Everest books out there. My coffee\ntable is in danger of imminent collapse under their weight; my shelves sag\nwith Everest encyclopedias and memoirs. It\u2019s been done, I told him.\n\nListen carefully, he said: This will be different. It will be the story of the\nentire guiding industry that was created on and around the world\u2019s highest\nmountain. He planned to call it Everest, Inc.\n\nThat got my interest, because I put about a quarter century of blood, sweat,\nand tears into this \u201cindustry.\u201d I first went to the Big E in the early 1990s,\nwhich turned out to be the dawn of the commercial era on the Goddess Mother of\nthe Earth. Following years of adventure in the Himalayas, I quit guiding\n8,000-meter peaks after the twin disaster years of 2014\u2014when an avalanche on\nEverest killed 16 Nepali workers in the Khumbu Icefall\u2014and 2015, when a\n7.8-magnitude earthquake killed 19 people at Everest Base Camp and a total of\n9,000 people in Nepal.\n\nRescue operations in 2015, in the wake of a huge earthquake that flattened\nparts of Everest Base Camp and devastated various areas in Nepal (Photo:\nRoberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty)\n\n#### Similar Reads\n\nThe Disposable Man: A Western History of Sherpas on Everest\n\nHow Hollywood Filmed a Movie on Everest\n\nPeak Poop: The Feces Problem on Everest Needs a Solution\n\nTwo Books Show the Good and Bad of Everest Obsession\n\nI had to admit to Cockrell that a history of Everest as a business hadn\u2019t been\ndone, but I\u2019m pretty cynical, and I wasn\u2019t sure that he was the right person\nto do it. I\u2019ve long enjoyed his magazine articles in venues like Men\u2019s\nJournal, Outside, and GQ, and I know he put in some good years climbing rock\nand crags. I even guided him on Denali a while back. But he isn\u2019t an Everest\nclimber, much less an Everest guide. How was he going to understand the\nbusiness? And, failing that, was he just going to take the usual potshots\nabout how we exploited Sherpas and destroyed the environment and clogged up a\nsacred mountain with privileged neophytes who hadn\u2019t \u201cearned\u201d the right to be\nthere?\n\nBut Cockrell seemed to value my input, and as someone who\u2019s been captivated by\nEverest for so long, I wanted to avoid the foolish mistake of thinking that\neveryone already knows this story as well as I do. They don\u2019t, and one of the\nvirtues of Everest, Inc. is that it sneaks up on you and becomes a history of\nthe whole damn thing. In the 1920s, there was George Mallory; then came Edmund\nHillary and Tenzing Norgay, who achieved the first summit in 1953; and then\nthere were the heroic hardasses of the 1970s and 1980s, climbers like Reinhold\nMessner and Jerzy Kukuczka, who got to the top using new routes, or by\nclimbing without oxygen, or in winter, or during the summer monsoon. In 1985,\nDick Bass came along and popularized the idea of climbing the Seven Summits,\nthe highest mountain on each continent. In the 1990s, guides like Todd\nBurleson, Eric Simonson, and Russell Brice turned Everest into a gold mine and\nmade climbing it start to look easy. But the Into Thin Air deaths of 1996 put\nan end to that.\n\nFrom left: Seven Summits pioneer Dick Bass on top of Mount Everest, April 30,\n1985; Todd Burleson (center) and Lakpa Rita (right) completed their first\nEverest summits in 1992, alongside clients from Burleson\u2019s company, Alpine\nAscents International. (Photos: Courtesy David Breashears; Courtesy Todd\nBurleson)\n\nThere were also obvious tensions, exemplified in 2013 by a confrontation that\ninvolved climbers Simone Moro, Ueli Steck, and a number of Sherpas. It was\nspurred by a specific encounter on the Lhotse Face, but it also came to\nsymbolize long standing friction between Western climbers and guides and home-\ngrown mountaineers from Nepal. The year 2019 saw another potent symbol of how\ncrowded the mountain had become: the famous and startling Conga Line photo,\nwhich showed a long queue of climbers en route to the Hillary Step and the\nsummit.\n\nAs for Cockrell, his overall focus is on how two great transformations came\nabout. The first\u2014in the late 1980s and early 1990s\u2014happened when expeditions\nbacked by nations gave way to client-funded trips, and how those, in turn,\ndeveloped into guided climbs. Something that was once unimaginable became\nroutine. This shift was marked and shaped by particular tragedies, by the\nthirst for money and publicity and power, but also by heroism and the absolute\nthrill of climbing\u2014and working\u2014in extreme environments.\n\nThe second great transformation\u2014which is ongoing\u2014is the power transfer away\nfrom the foreign men and women who invented the Everest industry to the\nNepalis and Sherpas who are determined to shape its future.\n\nCockrell has done a masterful job of putting the now-sprawling industry into\nan understandable and vastly entertaining context: his book isn\u2019t just another\ncatalog of expeditions and statistics. Improbably, Everest, Inc. is a story\nwith narrative drive, as Cockrell makes it clear how one thing led to another.\nIt succeeds precisely because he\u2019s a real journalist and storyteller, rather\nthan just another antagonist with scores to settle. This project required a\nprofessional, someone with the energy and interest to track down and\ninterrogate a thousand quirky and often egotistical characters. Cockrell\ntalked to the movers and shakers who built the industry, and to those who\ncarried its weight on their backs. He sifted through mountains of published\nmaterial and documentaries to understand changes in the game.\n\nAfter an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall on April 18, 2014, survivors worked\nto free and assist the injured. Sixteen Nepali workers died. (Photo: Robert\nKay/AFP/Getty)\n\nAs I said, I thought I knew it all about the main players, but reading\nEverest, Inc. reminded me that I only knew them superficially. Just because we\nshared a climbing route, a poker table, and endless hours waiting for weather\nand coughs to go away didn\u2019t necessarily give us full insight into each other.\nCockrell asked the right questions, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning who my\nmentors and cohorts actually were and what motivated them.\n\nWe\u2019re losing some of them, of course. In the week I spent reading the book,\nDavid Breashears and Lou Whittaker died. Both are key figures in the evolution\nthat Cockrell maps out in Everest, Inc., and their loss makes me thankful that\ntheir reflections were preserved. And yes, a number of us talked smack about\neach other to Cockrell, but his reporting of these remarks doesn\u2019t devolve\ninto gossip. Even in the cases where important people\u2014like Jon Krakauer and\nNirmal \u201cNims\u201d Purja\u2014wouldn\u2019t speak to him, he goes to considerable effort to\ngive balanced assessments of their contributions to Everest history.\n\nAs for my worry that Everest, Inc. would take the standard and easy shots,\nI\u2019ll admit I was relieved. Cockrell doesn\u2019t shy away from controversies, but\nhe doesn\u2019t sensationalize them, either. The ethnic and economic tensions that\nhave driven change in commercial climbing become a central theme. The\npersistent worry that modern climbers routinely and blithely walk past the\ndead and dying is addressed. (My belief is that rescues should be attempted\nwhen they\u2019re feasible, but that it\u2019s always possible for climbers to get\nthemselves so deeply into trouble that no one can save them.) He shines a\nlight on the tangled relationship between guided climbing and the media\ncovering it.\n\nThis is tricky stuff, and I think Cockrell makes it clear that newspapers,\nmagazines, books, and films are big parts of the enterprise, too. Their\ntendency to hype the deaths and disasters have served as fuel on the\ncommercial fire. Time after time, business increased in the wake of well-\npublicized accidents and mishaps.\n\nA long line of Everest climbers just below camp four on May 22, 2019 (Photo:\nRizza Alee/AP)\n\nBetween the lines of Cockrell\u2019s book, one can easily discern that more than a\nfew Everest climbers attempted the mountain so they could set themselves apart\nfrom mere mortals. Nothing aided them more than the perception that taking\nEverest on was death-defying and extreme. Those of us guiding and leading\nexpeditions hated the coverage and railed against the media\u2014unless of course\nwe were the ones being interviewed in a given year, since there aren\u2019t a lot\nof shy folks in this industry, and we all liked the spotlight. (Some of us\nstill do, and as I read, I got mildly irritated that a few relentless self-\npromoters get even more coverage in Everest, Inc., at the expense of some of\nthe hardest-working Sherpas and guides on the mountain.) Invariably, the story\nstrays from the actual craft of climbing and guiding that drew me to this\nworld to begin with, but that\u2019s Cockrell\u2019s point. This isn\u2019t a book about the\nmythical and virtuous climber toiling toward some noble and deeply personal\ngoal. It\u2019s about the Inc.\n\nEverest, Inc. puts the big events and obvious disasters in clear focus. But\nCockrell also does a credible job of explaining that it doesn\u2019t necessarily\ntake an act of god to kill people on the mountain. The transformations that\nhe\u2019s highlighting mean, in essence, that the mountain is becoming more\naccessible\u2014which many would view as an inherently good thing. But more people\non the mountain will mean more people dying. Plain and simple. And shifting\nthe business to those eager to take on more clients for less money\u2014and in the\nprocess hiring less-experienced mountain workers\u2014will have that same act-of-\ngod effect from time to time. There will be deaths\u2014and headlines all over the\nworld\u2014even when a major storm or avalanche isn\u2019t the cause. Face it, the daily\nsquall is bad enough at 28,000 feet. The sun simply going down at the end of\nthe day is a disaster when you\u2019re cold and strung out. Calamities will hit the\nnew operators a little harder, but Everest, Inc. points out that the old-guard\noperators put their share of clients and guides way out there beyond their\nabilities.\n\nThe book explains where the industry is headed and who\u2019s taking it there.\nCockrell gives an important and articulate voice to the Sherpas and Nepalis\ndriving the current phase of commercial climbing, not just on Everest, but on\neach of the world\u2019s highest mountains. There is a fitting balance to the\nstory. Yes, there was a fascinating period when the great western Everest\nguides roamed the planet, brought the clients, hired the help, called the\nshots, and made the movies. But Everest, Inc. makes it clear that this era has\npassed, which isn\u2019t really a bad thing. This future is fascinating, too, and\nthe characters\u2014this time from more diverse backgrounds\u2014are still larger than\nlife.\n\nBuy the Book\n\nFiled to:\n\n  * Climbing\n  * Everest\n  * Long Reads\n  * Mount Everest\n  * Mountaineering\n\nLead Photo: Karin Dohmen/Getty (Everest); filo/Getty (Topo Map)\n\nWhen you buy something using the retail links in our stories, we may earn a\nsmall commission.
