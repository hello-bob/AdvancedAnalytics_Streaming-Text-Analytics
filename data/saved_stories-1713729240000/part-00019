Financial institutions helped Bill acquire\ntens of thousands of SMEs as its customers, but these customers contributed\nless than 3% of the company\u2019s revenue in 2023.\n\nWhile one can see an amazing growth opportunity in increasing monetization of\nthis customer segment, I now start to think that this effort might be a dead\nend. Bill monetizes its customers primarily through payment processing fees,\nand payment fees is not something that big banks would be willing to share.\n\nLet me walk you through my thinking.\n\nJevgenijs\n\np.s. have feedback? reply to this email or find me on Twitter\n\nThanks for reading Popular Fintech! Subscribe to receive new posts and support\nmy work.\n\nBill (NYSE: BILL), a financial automation software provider for small and mid-\nsized businesses, has a fantastic roster of financial institution partners:\nJPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, American Express, Wells Fargo, and PNC. Bill\nprovides its financial institution partners with a white-label version of its\nplatform, which seamlessly integrates with partners\u2019 existing business banking\nservices, and helps their clients automate invoicing and payment processes.\n\nImage source: Bill FY Q2 2024 Investor Deck\n\nBill spent more than ten years forming connections with big financial\ninstitutions, and now these partners bring in many clients. Thus, in Fiscal Q2\n2024 alone (calendar Q4 2023), financial institutions helped Bill add 6,200\nclients, bringing the total number of \u201cshared clients\u201d to over 72,000\ncustomers. Excluding Divvy and Invoice2Go businesses, which Bill acquired in\n2021, financial institutions helped acquire a third of all Bill\u2019s clients (see\nthe chart below).\n\nThe problem is... these clients generate very little revenue for Bill. Thus,\nin 2023, financial institution customers generated revenue of $32.6 million,\nor roughly 3% of the company\u2019s subscription and transaction fees. In the same\nperiod, customers acquired directly or through accounting firms, generated\nrevenue of $1 billion (excluding the float revenue). Naturally, the question\nis if a decade of investments into building partnerships with financial\ninstitutions was worth it.\n\nBefore I try to answer this question, let\u2019s take a step back and look into how\nBill makes money. It has three sources of revenue: 1) transaction fees, or\nfees that its customers pay for payment processing, 2) subscription fees,\nwhich are monthly fees for using Bill\u2019s platform, and 3) float revenue, or the\ninterest that the company earns on customer funds.\n\nBill charges $45-79 per user per month for its platform. In 2023, subscription\nfees for Bill\u2019s platform contributed $223 million to the company\u2019s top line.\nIn addition, in 2021, Bill acquired Invoice2Go, an invoicing and expense-\ntracking solution, which brought in an additional $36 million in revenue.\n\nHowever, the majority of revenue comes from transaction fees, or fees for\nprocessing payments. Thus, in 2023, Bill\u2019s platform generated $365 million in\ntransaction fees. In addition, the company\u2019s Divvy (now called Spend &\nExpense) and Invoice2Go businesses generated $414 million in transaction fees.\nOn the company level, transaction fees contributed 65% of the company\u2019s 2023\ntotal revenue.\n\nI would also argue, that the company\u2019s float revenue, or the interest that\nBill earns by investing customer balances into short-term financial\ninstruments, should be credited to its payment processing capabilities. After\nall, customers would not hold funds with Bill (or rather its banking partners)\nif they couldn\u2019t make (or receive) payments using Bill\u2019s platform. In 2023,\nBill earned $153 million in float revenue, which represented 13% of the\ncompany\u2019s total revenue. So Bill is one of those software companies, that\nmakes most of its revenue from financial services.\n\n> \u201cWhen we process payment transactions, the funds flow through our bank\n> accounts, resulting in a balance of funds held for customers. We hold these\n> funds from the day they are withdrawn from a payer\u2019s account to the day the\n> funds are credited to the receiver.\u201d\n>\n> Q2 Fiscal 2024 10-Q\n\nGetting back to Bill\u2019s financial institution partners...The lack of revenue\ngenerated by financial institution clients comes down to them not using Bill\u2019s\npayment capabilities. As you can see in the chart below, in 2023, financial\ninstitution customers contributed just $22 billion, or 8.6%, to Bill\u2019s payment\nvolume. As a reminder, financial institution customers represented 1/3 of\nBill\u2019s customers.\n\nPer Bill's management comments, most of the company\u2019s financial institution\npartners offered only ACH and check payments to the customers using Bill\u2019s\nwhite-labeled platform. Thus, in addition to financial institution customers\nmaking relatively few payments (compared to Bill\u2019s direct customers), they\nalso use the products with the lowest take rate (Bill\u2019s average take rate is\n0.14%, take rate on card payments is 2.9%).\n\nImage source: Bill\n\n> Traditionally, most FI partners have offered just ACH and checks to their\n> customers through our platform. Given our payments expertise, large network\n> and extensive experience in driving payment adoption, we are making early\n> progress in bringing our ad valorem offerings to our FI partners. Six\n> financial institution partners have started leveraging more of our payment\n> modalities such as Virtual Card, Instant Transfer and Pay By Card.\n>\n> Q2 Fiscal 2024 earnings call\n\nAs an optimist, I always thought of Bill\u2019s partnerships with financial\ninstitutions as a growth opportunity. My thinking was that over time,\nfinancial institution customers will adopt Bill\u2019s payment capabilities, and\nwill start generating similar average revenue to the directly acquired\ncustomers. However, on the latest earnings call, Bill announced that its\nlargest partner, Bank of America, started \u201cevolving their firm-wide payment\nstrategy, and that evolution will impact the solutions they offer to their\nexisting customers.\u201d\n\nBill has been co-operating with Bank of America to serve the bank\u2019s new small\nbusiness customers. However, the endgame has always been to expand the\nsolution to the millions of Bank America\u2019s existing SME clients. Now this plan\nseems to be at risk, which made me revisit the question of whether Bill\u2019s\npartnerships with big banks are an opportunity or a dead end.\n\n> The opportunity that we have with the bank started with serving their new\n> small businesses on their digital platform. And so we had an agreement and a\n> plan that we are working on with the bank, and we are executing across that\n> over the last six months. And then just last month, things changed.

Yes, they might be less\ncapable of building streamlined processes and beautiful user interfaces than\nBill. But there is no way they would be ready to give up on payment fees and\nfree deposits. Especially, when we are talking about SMEs, which big banks\nrarely lend to.\n\nSo where does it leave Bill?... I think Bill will be fine, even if nothing\never materializes from partnerships with financial institutions. The company\nhas two fantastic businesses, Bill's AR/AP management platform, and Divvy\u2019s\nexpense management solution. Despite the slowdown in SME spending, analysts\nstill expect Bill to grow revenue by 17%, and EBITDA by 33% this fiscal year\n(which ends in June 2024), and deliver similar growth in the next fiscal year.\n\nThe company has finally completed the integration of Bill and Divvy platforms,\nso it can start cross-selling Divvy to Bill\u2019s direct customers. At the time of\nthe acquisition, the ambition was to, eventually, cross-sell Divvy to 50% of\nBill\u2019s direct clients. Cross-selling products is a difficult endeavor, but Jon\nRettig, the company\u2019s CFO, reiterated this cross-sell target while speaking at\nan investor conference in March 2024.\n\nBill is also leveraging the lending know-how from Divvy and the data on\ntransactions, suppliers, and invoices, from Bill\u2019s side, to expand its credit\noffering. Thus, according to the management\u2019s comments, Bill is piloting a\nworking capital solution. The company has originated \u201ctens of thousands of\nloans, north of $100 million\u201d during the initial beta, and sees strong demand\nfor the new product both from buyers and suppliers that the company works\nwith.\n\n> If you talk to small businesses and you hear the list of challenge in their\n> business, cash flow and working capital is always high on that list. And so\n> we know there is a real need.\n>\n> John Rettig, Bill CFO, at Wolfe Research Fintech Forum\n\nSo, maybe...Bill doesn\u2019t need those financial institutions. They can already\nhelp SMEs with invoice management and payments. They offer credit cards\nthrough Divvy and piloting a working capital solution. Looks like exactly what\nthose financial institutions offer to SMEs, correct? Of course, financial\ninstitutions like Bank of America also provide current accounts, but Bill can\neasily solve this gap by partnering with smaller, Fintech-friendly banks.\nLet\u2019s see how this evolves, but Bill a certainly a company worth following!\n\nThanks for reading Popular Fintech!
