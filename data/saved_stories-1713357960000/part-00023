Whatever your\nwriting platform - Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, or iOS - help is here.\n\nWritten by Jack Wallen, Contributing Writer April 16, 2024 at 1:54 p.m. PT\n\n### rank\n\n### change\n\n### trend\n\n1\n\nnew\n\nOpenAI's Voice Engine can now clone a voice from a 15-second clip\n\n2\n\nnew\n\nWaymo self-driving cars start delivering Uber Eats orders\n\n3\n\nnew\n\nApple releases ReALM AI model to outperform GPT-4\n\n4\n\nnew\n\nDALL-E now uses prompts to edit AI-generated images\n\nread full trend report\n\nMirageC/Getty Images\n\nI get tunnel vision when I'm writing. Once I'm deep into the flow, most\neverything disappears, and it's just me and the words. However, I can't always\nget deep into that flow. Sometimes my mind wants to wander. Typically, I allow\nsuch curiosity, because it often leads to a thought I might not otherwise have\nhad. Either that -- or my brain simply needs the break.\n\nAlso: I've published 60 novels - and these 5 free writing tools helped make it\npossible\n\nBut at times, those distractions do throw me off my game. Writing is a finicky\nbeast. A five-minute break can easily become 15 or 20 minutes as you must take\nthe time to get back into that zone you walked away from.\n\nYou don't want that.\n\nTo avoid such distractions, I have a particular set of tools I can turn to\n(for when my mind is feeling particularly wander-ish). Here they are.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\n## 1\\. Calmly Writer: No-nonsense focus\n\nNormally, I use LibreOffice as my word processor of choice. It's free, open-\nsource, cross-platform, and powerful. But sometimes I need to pare the\nfeatures down until it's just a bare-bones writing tool --just me and the\nwords.\n\nWhen I need my concentration to be laser-focused on composing a narrative, I\nturn to Calmy Writer. Imagine having what looks like a standard terminal\nwindow but with the power of a word processor. That's Calmy Writer. This app\nstrips away the nonsense and presents you with only what you need to get the\nwords down.\n\nAlso: 5 ways LibreOffice meets my writing needs better than Google Docs can\n\nThere is minimal formatting but just enough to allow you to create H2/H2,\nbold, italics, bulleted lists, numbered lists, links, and quotes. You also get\nreal-time feedback for word count, character count, and average reading time.\nThe tabbed interface can also be used in full-screen mode, which makes it an\nideal tool for pushing away distractions.\n\nCalmly Writer offers a free trial. To continue using the app, you'll have to\ndrop a one-time $14.99 license fee. You can install Calmly Writer on Linux,\nMacOS, Windows, and ChromeOS.\n\n## 2\\. Opera: Yes, a browser - for research\n\nIncluding a web browser in a list of distraction-free tools might seem\ncounterintuitive, but hear me out. It's inevitable: While writing, you'll have\nto do some research now and then. I regularly have to look things up when\nwriting. For example, my current book series is set in Boston. Since I don't\nlive in Boston, I need to check on street names, neighborhoods, and other\nfacts that could distract readers if they're wrong. For that, I need a\nbrowser.\n\nWhy Opera? Two reasons: Workspaces and Aria. Workspaces is the best tab\nmanagement system on the market. I have a Writing workspace, which I only use\nfor -- you guessed it -- writing. When I'm writing, I don't leave that\nWorkspace and I don't open social media, shopping, or other non-writing-\nrelated sites.\n\nAlso: 5 reasons why Opera is my favorite browser (and you should check it out\ntoo)\n\nAria is Opera's built-in AI and I use it strictly for research. Why do I opt\nfor Aria over a Google search? Because I can get the answers I need faster and\nwithout worrying about landing on sites overloaded with ads or other\ndistractions. I can type \"What is the average amount of snowfall in Boston\nbetween January and March?\" and get an immediate answer. Beyond research, I do\nnot use AI in my writing (nor do I copy/paste anything from Aria's responses).\n\nOpera is free and can be installed on Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, and iOS.\n\n## 3\\. Limit: Cut down on distracting sites\n\nSpeaking of web browsers: If you have trouble governing your web browser usage\n(especially on social media sites), consider using an extension like Limit,\nwhich allows you to set time limits on distracting sites. For instance, you\ncould set a five-minute limit (the minimum) on Facebook, so every time you\nfeel a need for a distraction, you can be sure it will only last five minutes.\nAny website can be added and you'll find 10 pre-configured sites (that are\nknown for being distracting).\n\nAlso: The best smart notebooks: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nIf you find yourself constantly doom-scrolling when you should be writing,\nLimit is a must. Limit is free and can be installed on Chromium-based and\nFirefox-based browsers.\n\n## 4\\. Blanket: Ambient sounds instead of music\n\nEvery so often I need sound to keep me centered. The problem with listening to\nmusic when I write is that the tunes tend to color my prose, narration, and\ndialogue. Because of that, I would always have to switch to music that matched\nthe tone of what I was working on. On top of that, I can't listen to music\nwith lyrics because I might allow those words to inform my writing.\n\nAlso: I listened to over 100 hours of music last year. These headphones\nsounded the best\n\nWhat I now use instead is an app like Blanket, which creates ambient sounds\nlike rain, storm, wind, waves, stream, birds, summer night, train, boat, city,\ncoffee shop, fireplace, pink noise, white noise, and even custom sounds that\nyou add. You can raise the volume of each sound to create a noise scape of\ndifferent sounds, such as storms and waves or rain and coffee shops.\n\nBlanket is free and only available for Linux, but you'll find plenty of\nambient sound apps for MacOS and Windows.\n\n## 5\\. Pomodoro: Set a timer and - go!\n\nTypically, I \"time\" my fiction-writing sessions by word count and not by time\nspent. I aim for 1,000 words per day. But once in a while, I'll do a writing\nsprint, where I'll set a time limit and just start writing stream of\nconsciousness. This is a great writing exercise because it challenges you to\nnot stop writing for a set period. It doesn't matter what you write, as long\nas you don't stop writing.\n\nFor that, I need a good timer and the Pomodoro timer on Linux is a great\noption. (If you're curious, the Pomodoro Technique is a time management system\nthat uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals.) This timer is also an\noption for breaks. Set the timer for five minutes and give your brain a rest.\n\nAlso: 5 ways to manage your time more effectively at work\n\nPomodoro is free to install on Linux. You'll find plenty of Pomodoro timers\nfor MacOS and Windows.\n\nAnd there you have it, five apps I depend on when distractions become an\nissue. I'm confident that at least one of these tools will help you focus so\nyou can get the words to the page more efficiently -- and without suffering\nunder the weight of your mind's wanderlust.\n\n#### Featured\n\nI tested Dell's 2024 XPS 14 laptop and can't recommend it enough\n\nZoom gets its first major overhaul in 10 years, powered by generative AI\n\nSony's newest headphones eased my XM5 envy with all-day comfort and plenty of\nbass\n\nThe best phones for 2024: Expert tested\n\n  * I tested Dell's 2024 XPS 14 laptop and can't recommend it enough\n\n  * Zoom gets its first major overhaul in 10 years, powered by generative AI\n\n  * Sony's newest headphones eased my XM5 envy with all-day comfort and plenty of bass\n\n  * The best phones for 2024: Expert tested\n\nEditorial standards\n\nShow Comments\n\nLog In to Comment Community Guidelines\n\nx\n\nplayer version| 3.2.1  \n---|---  \nplayback state| -1  \ntransition state| start  \n  \n00:00 00:00 Live\n\nLearn More\n\n### Related\n\n### This free Microsoft Office alternative has just as many productivity tools\n(including ChatGPT)\n\n### The best smart notebooks you can buy: Expert tested\n\n### The best note-taking tablets: Expert tested\n\nZDNET\n\nwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at\nhome.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Galleries\n  * Videos\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n  * about ZDNET\n  * Meet The Team\n  * Sitemap\n  * Reprint Policy\n\n  * Join\n\n|\n\nLog In\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Site Assistance\n  * Licensing\n\n\u00a9 2024 ZDNET, A Red Ventures company.
