companies in the\nInternet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems sectors, and aligns Espressif's\nand M5Stack\u2019s common vision to democratize AIoT technology.\n\nEspressif Systems (SSE: 688018.SH) has announced its acquisition of a majority\nstake in M5Stack. This strategic move marks a significant milestone for both\ncompanies in the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems sectors, and\naligns Espressif's and M5Stack\u2019s common vision to democratize AIoT technology.\n\nM5Stack is renowned for its innovative approach to hardware development and\noffers a modular, open-source platform that simplifies the creation of IoT and\nembedded system solutions, greatly enhancing deployment efficiency. Its\ndiverse range of branded products essentially covers the entire IoT and\nembedded field. The M5Stack ecosystem is built around its flagship main\ncontrol module, powered by Espressif\u2019s all ESP32 series of chips, highlighting\nthe deep technical synergy between the two companies.\n\nThe platform supports the rapid prototyping of smart devices: on the hardware\nside, it accommodates a variety of expansion modules, including environmental\nand motion sensors, camera modules, GPS modules, and more; on the software\nside, in addition to support for ESP-IDF and Arduino, it also provides users\nwith the fully proprietary low-code development platform UIFlow and data\nservice EZData. M5Stack also has a vibrant developer community, boasting\nextensive developer influence.\n\nThe collaboration between Espressif and M5Stack is poised to enhance\nEspressif\u2019s ecosystem, leveraging M5Stack's extensive experience in industrial\nIoT applications to expand Espressif\u2019s range of AIoT technology offering which\nincludes chips, software, cloud middleware, tools and logistics support.\n\nThis acquisition also demonstrates that Espressif's commitment extends beyond\nits proprietary hardware, embracing third-party collaborations to foster a\ndiverse ecosystem of IoT solutions.\n\nEspressif achieved its highest performance level in an historical Q1-2024. In\nQ1-2024, the company achieved revenue of RMB 387.19 million, marking a 21.71%\nyear-on-year increase.
