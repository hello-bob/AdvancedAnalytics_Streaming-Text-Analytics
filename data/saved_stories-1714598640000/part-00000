If the filename is\nreally long then, you can't see the extension (see image below).\n\n2ndly and may not be so obvious, malicious PDF filename is constructed as with\na right-to-left override character is such a way that the file ends \".pdf\"\nextension, but really is an \".exe\".\n\nSo in example below, the 2nd file looks like a \".txt\" file, but is really a\n\".docx\" file (the 1st file). The 1st file has been cleansed of the RTL Unicode\ncharacter, and ends in \".docx\".\n\nThe PDF file is actually an \".exe\" file, but looks like it will open with\ndefault PDF reader.\n\nDownload RTLExample.7z ( it includes the above files with PDF \".exe\" example.\nThe files contain no viruses or malware. The PDF is safe \".exe\", and just\nopens this page in Chrome). The \"PDF\" is safe \".exe\", and just opens this page\nin Chrome. But GDrive marks these examples \"Sorry, this file is infected with\na virus\", which good because they are detecting the RTL character and exe. But\nit a false positive, since there is no virus in the files. You can create you\nown examples by inserting the RTL character into the filename, see this video\nhttps://youtu.be/n2kV3Q2eTCY).\n\nHere's the same files as viewed from the command (cmd.exe) line. The box\ncharacter represents the RTL character.\n\nNote: Detection of malicious file is never done by a filename alone, so a good\nantivirus will flag the contents of this file, for known signatures. BUT you\ncan remove the annoying RTL character with the free tool below!\n\nHow is RTLO being abused by malware writers?\n\nIn apps that support Unicode like Window Explorer, the right-to-left override\nmalware method uses a RTL Unicode character, that will reverse the order of\nthe characters that follow it. It's used mainly for Middle Eastern/Asian\nlanguages that you read right-to-left.\n\nRTLO can be used to spoof fake extensions. To do this we need a hidden RTL\nUnicode character in the file name.\n\nWhat is \u201cRight-to-Left Override\u201d RTLO?\n\nThe RTLO method is used to hide the true type of a file, so it might trick you\ninto open text file (.txt) which really is a Word file (.docx) with malicious\nmalware. More recently this file could hide a .wav file. Audio files such .wav\nfile are being embedded with malware, is on the forefront of malware\nmaliciousness. Read about that on my post here.\n\nThe method exploits a feature built into Windows Explorer. Since Microsoft\nWindows does a great job of supporting different languages from around the\nworld, some of those languages that are written from right-to-left (RTL).\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to use a right-to-left written language, like Hebrew or\nArabic, on a site combined with a left-to-right written language like English\nor French. In this case, you would want bidirectional script support.\n\nBidirectional script support is the capability of a computer system to\ncorrectly display bi-directional text. In HTML we can use Unicode right-to-\nleft marks and left-to-right marks to override the HTML bidirectional\nalgorithm when it produces undesirable results:\n\nleft-to-right mark: (U+200E) Unicode character right-to-left mark: (U+200F)\nUnicode character\n\nHow do you fix files that have the RTLO or other bad characters ?\n\nHere's a tool I built to clean up Right-to-Left Mark (and many others) and\nUnicode Control Characters from your files. It's super fast, small and written\nin native C++.\n\nUpdated Thu 21-Apr-22 - new build, fixed many recursive issues\n\nDownload touchRTL.7z (you need https://www.7-zip.org/ to unpack). For personal\nuse only. Will open this page on each run. Copy into c:\\windows to use from\ncmd.exe.\n\nLicense :\n\ntouchRTL.7z personal use only, for commercial use buy touchLTRPRO. Contact as\nvalidated today 5/1/2024 and is metadataconsult@gmail.com available for\nlicense request.\n\ntouchRTLPRO.7z, has flags to remove Unicode spaces and punctuations (math\nsymbols, currency, open closing braces, and accent marks).\n\nJust run this command and it will recursively rename filenames to remove those\ncharacters under the specified directory name. If directory name, contains\nspaces you need quotes.\n\n    \n    \n    touchRTL -v -R -l -y \"directory name\"\n\nwhere\n\n    \n    \n    Usage: touchRTL [-aclmpRuvxy] [-r REFFILE | -d DATETIME] PATH... UNIX touch mimic, updates files access, modification and creation times of file(s) in PATH to the current time, If PATH argument does not exist, creates corresponding new empty file or directory (using -y), unless -c or --n Supports directory recursion and time stamping!
