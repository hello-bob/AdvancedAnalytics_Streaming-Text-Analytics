According to French business magazine Challenges, the acquisition\nwas finalized in December.\n\nDatakalab described itself as \u201cexperts in low power, runtime efficient, and\ndeep learning algorithms\u201d that work on device.\n\nOn its LinkedIn page, Datakalab highlights \u201cindustry leading compression and\nadaptation to deploy embedded computer vision that is fast, cost-effective and\nprecise.\u201d Prior to the Apple acquisition had between 10 and 20 employees.\n\nFrom Datakalab\u2019s now-defunct website:\n\n> Datakalab is a French technology company that develops computer image\n> analysis algorithms to measure flows in public space. The images are\n> instantly transformed into anonymized statistical data processed locally in\n> 100ms.\n>\n> Datakalab does not store any images or personal data and only keeps\n> statistical data. Datakalab products are built according to the principle of\n> \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d.\n\nDatakalab teamed up with the French government in May 2020 to deploy AI tools\ninto Paris transportation systems to check whether people were wearing face\nmasks. The company also worked with Disney and other partners in the past.\n\nWhile neither Apple nor DatakaLab have acknowledged the acquisition,\nChallenges says that the deal was reported to the European Commission this\nmonth. The report says that Datakalab\u2019s two founders did not join Apple, but\nmultiple other employees did make the jump. Datakalab also held multiple\npatents related to AI compression and vision technology.\n\nThe acquisition comes as Apple is expected to bring a suite of AI features to\niOS 18 later this year. Datakalab also developed advanced vision-based\ntechnology, which could play a role in Apple\u2019s Vision Pro ambitions into the\nfuture. The company\u2019s advanced facial recognition technology could also\ncontribute to things like Photos and Face ID.\n\n(via iPhoneSoft)\n\nFollow Chance: Threads, Twitter, Instagram, and Mastodon.\n\nAdd 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
