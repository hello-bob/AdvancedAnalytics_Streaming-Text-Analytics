Circles with q \u2264 10 are labelled as\np/q and color-coded according to q. Each circle is tangent to the base line\nand its neighboring circles. Irreducible fractions with the same denominator\nhave circles of the same size.\n\nIn mathematics, a Ford circle is a circle in the Euclidean plane, in a family\nof circles that are all tangent to the -axis at rational points. For each\nrational number , expressed in lowest terms, there is a Ford circle whose\ncenter is at the point and whose radius is . It is tangent to the -axis at its\nbottom point, . The two Ford circles for rational numbers and (both in lowest\nterms) are tangent circles when and otherwise these two circles are\ndisjoint.^[1]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nFord circles are a special case of mutually tangent circles; the base line can\nbe thought of as a circle with infinite radius. Systems of mutually tangent\ncircles were studied by Apollonius of Perga, after whom the problem of\nApollonius and the Apollonian gasket are named.^[2] In the 17th century Ren\u00e9\nDescartes discovered Descartes' theorem, a relationship between the\nreciprocals of the radii of mutually tangent circles.^[2]\n\nFord circles also appear in the Sangaku (geometrical puzzles) of Japanese\nmathematics. A typical problem, which is presented on an 1824 tablet in the\nGunma Prefecture, covers the relationship of three touching circles with a\ncommon tangent. Given the size of the two outer large circles, what is the\nsize of the small circle between them? The answer is equivalent to a Ford\ncircle:^[3]\n\nFord circles are named after the American mathematician Lester R. Ford, Sr.,\nwho wrote about them in 1938.^[1]\n\n## Properties[edit]\n\nComparison of Ford circles and a Farey diagram with circular arcs for n from 1\nto 9. Note that each arc intersects its corresponding circles at right angles.\nIn the SVG image, hover over a circle or curve to highlight it and its terms.\n\nThe Ford circle associated with the fraction is denoted by or There is a Ford\ncircle associated with every rational number. In addition, the line is counted\nas a Ford circle \u2013 it can be thought of as the Ford circle associated with\ninfinity, which is the case\n\nTwo different Ford circles are either disjoint or tangent to one another. No\ntwo interiors of Ford circles intersect, even though there is a Ford circle\ntangent to the x-axis at each point on it with rational coordinates. If is\nbetween 0 and 1, the Ford circles that are tangent to can be described\nvariously as\n\n  1. the circles where ^[1]\n  2. the circles associated with the fractions that are the neighbors of in some Farey sequence,^[1] or\n  3. the circles where is the next larger or the next smaller ancestor to in the Stern\u2013Brocot tree or where is the next larger or next smaller ancestor to .^[1]\n\nIf and are two tangent Ford circles, then the circle through and (the\nx-coordinates of the centers of the Ford circles) and that is perpendicular to\nthe -axis (whose center is on the x-axis) also passes through the point where\nthe two circles are tangent to one another.\n\nThe centers of the Ford circles constitute a discrete (and hence countable)\nsubset of the plane, whose closure is the real axis - an uncountable set.\n\nFord circles can also be thought of as curves in the complex plane. The\nmodular group of transformations of the complex plane maps Ford circles to\nother Ford circles.^[1]\n\nFord circles are a sub-set of the circles in the Apollonian gasket generated\nby the lines and and the circle ^[4]\n\nBy interpreting the upper half of the complex plane as a model of the\nhyperbolic plane (the Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model), Ford circles can be\ninterpreted as horocycles. In hyperbolic geometry any two horocycles are\ncongruent. When these horocycles are circumscribed by apeirogons they tile the\nhyperbolic plane with an order-3 apeirogonal tiling.\n\n## Total area of Ford circles[edit]\n\nThere is a link between the area of Ford circles, Euler's totient function the\nRiemann zeta function and Ap\u00e9ry's constant ^[5] As no two Ford circles\nintersect, it follows immediately that the total area of the Ford circles\n\nis less than 1. In fact the total area of these Ford circles is given by a\nconvergent sum, which can be evaluated. From the definition, the area is\n\nSimplifying this expression gives\n\nwhere the last equality reflects the Dirichlet generating function for Euler's\ntotient function Since this finally becomes\n\nNote that as a matter of convention, the previous calculations excluded the\ncircle of radius corresponding to the fraction . It includes the complete\ncircle for , half of which lies outside the unit interval, hence the sum is\nstill the fraction of the unit square covered by Ford circles.\n\n## Ford spheres (3D)[edit]\n\nFord spheres above the complex domain\n\nThe concept of Ford circles can be generalized from the rational numbers to\nthe Gaussian rationals, giving Ford spheres. In this construction, the complex\nnumbers are embedded as a plane in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, and\nfor each Gaussian rational point in this plane one constructs a sphere tangent\nto the plane at that point. For a Gaussian rational represented in lowest\nterms as , the diameter of this sphere should be where represents the complex\nconjugate of . The resulting spheres are tangent for pairs of Gaussian\nrationals and with , and otherwise they do not intersect each other.^[6]^[7]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Apollonian gasket \u2013 a fractal with infinite mutually tangential circles in a circle instead of on a line\n  * Steiner chain\n  * Pappus chain\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f Ford, L.
