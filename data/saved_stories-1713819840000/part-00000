In order to\nreduce the negative impact of waste PCBs on human health and the environment,\nthey must be properly disposed of. A new method is demonstrated for recycling\nwaste PCBs. It is referred to as the high-temperature thermo-mechano-chemical\ngasification (TMCG) of PCBs by the detonation-born gasification agent (GA),\nwhich is a blend of H_2O and CO_2 heated to a temperature above 2000 \u00b0C. The\nGA is produced in a pulsed detonation gun (PDG) operating on a near-\nstoichiometric methane\u2013oxygen mixture. The PDG operates in a pulsed mode\nproducing pulsed supersonic jets of GA and pulsed shock waves possessing a\nhuge destructive power. When the PDG is attached to a compact flow reactor\nfilled with waste PCBs, the PCBs are subject to the intense thermo-mechano-\nchemical action of both strong shock waves and high-temperature supersonic\njets of GA in powerful vortical structures established in the flow reactor.\nThe shock waves grind waste PCBs into fine particles, which undergo repeated\ninvolvement and gasification in the high-temperature vortical structures of\nthe GA. Demonstration experiments show full (above 98%) gasification of the 1\nkg batch of organic matter in a setup operation time of less than 350 s. The\ngaseous products of PCB gasification are mainly composed of CO_2, CO, H_2,\nN_2, and CH_4, with the share of flammable gas components reaching about 45\nvol%. The solid residues appear in the form of fine powder with visible metal\ninclusions of different sizes. All particles in the powder freed from the\nvisible metal inclusions possess a size less than 300\u2013400 \u03bcm, including a\nlarge fraction of sizes less than 100 \u03bcm. The powder contains Sn, Pb, Cu, Ni,\nFe, In, Cd, Zn, Ca, Si, Al, Ti, Ni, and Cl. Among these substances, Sn (10\u201320\nwt%), Pb (5\u201310 wt%), and Cu (up to 1.5 wt%) are detected in the maximum\namounts. In the powder submitted for analysis, precious elements Ag, Au, and\nPt are not detected. Some solid mass (about 20 wt% of the processed PCBs) is\nremoved from the flow reactor with the escaping gas and is partly (about 10\nwt%) trapped by the cyclones in the exhaust cleaning system. Metal inclusions\nof all visible sizes accumulate only in the flow reactor and are not detected\nin powder samples extracted from the cyclones. The gasification degree of the\nsolid residues extracted from the cyclones ranges from 76 to 91 wt%, i.e.,\nthey are gasified only partly. This problem will be eliminated in future work.\n\nKeywords:\n\nprinted circuit boards; precious metals; organic fraction removal; high-\ntemperature H_2O/CO_2 gasification; pulsed detonation gun; syngas; solid\nresidue particles\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nElectronic waste (e-waste) is a type of waste containing electronic and other\nelectrical devices and their metal and nonmetal parts. The volume of e-waste\nin municipal solid waste (MSW) is gradually growing [1,2]. Printed circuit\nboards (PCBs) are the main components of e-waste. Despite the fact that their\nshare in the total volume of MSW is relatively small, they contain a\nsignificant amount of hazardous and toxic pollutants due to such substances as\nmercury and the components of polymer substrates (resin), glass fiber epoxy\nlaminates, and fill compounds like polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated\nbiphenyls, polyvinyl chloride, brominated flame retardants, polybrominated\ndiphenyl ethers, and tetrabromobisphenol-A [3,4,5]. Some of them cause the\nformation of dioxins and furans during e-waste smelting and incineration\n[6,7]. Parts of PCBs, connectors and wires, capacitors, and batteries contain\ninclusions of cadmium, nickel, arsenic, copper, lead, antimony, asbestos, etc.\nElectronic waste includes valuable, rare earth, and precious metals that can\nbe reused. The main recyclable material is iron, and the main non-ferrous\nmetals are aluminum and copper. The content of precious metals, e.g., gold,\nsilver, platinum, and palladium, may exceed the content of these metals in the\noriginal ore during their extraction. It is important to extract useful\ncomponents for their reuse and return them to the production cycle after\nappropriate preparation.\n\nIn order to reduce the negative impact of waste PCBs on human health and the\nenvironment, they must be properly disposed of. There exist several approaches\nto PCB recycling. One approach is simply landfilling [8,9,10]. It is reported\nin [2,11,12] that most of the nonmetal (organic) wastes of PCBs (76\u201394%) are\ntreated as landfill, while about 40% go to uncontrolled landfilling. Another\napproach is based on the mechanical processing of PCBs, which includes\ndisassembly, crushing, pulverizing, and separation [13,14,15,16] for\nliberating various metals from cladding materials such as resin, fiberglass,\nand plastics. For this purpose, different energy-intensive crushers (hammer,\nrotary, disk, etc.), mills (disk, ball, etc.), cutters, and shredders with\nsieves are used. An alternative to landfilling and mechanical processing is\nthe thermal processing of waste PCBs via open burning [17], smelting [18],\nincineration [19,20], low-temperature (up to 800 \u00b0C) pyrolysis [21,22] and\nautothermal/allothermal gasification [23,24,25,26]. Open burning, smelting and\nincineration are environmentally unsafe due to emissions of hazardous and\ntoxic pollutants. During low-temperature pyrolysis, the organic matter is\ndecomposed to the syngas containing noncondensable and hazardous condensable\n(tar) gaseous hydrocarbons and phenolic tar, whereas solid residues, including\nchar, slag, and minerals are further processed to extract metals. The\ngasification of waste PCBs involves partial oxidation of organic constituents\nwith the aid of an externally fed gasifying agent (GA) containing either free\nor bound oxygen (air, O_2, H_2O, CO_2) to produce syngas. The maximum\nconversion efficiency is achieved if all carbon is oxidized to CO. Despite\nsteam and CO_2-assisted gasification currently being considered the most\nsustainable and effective method for waste PCB management, the thermal\nprocessing of e-waste is still treated as environmentally unsafe due to\nemissions of the various pollutants such as HCl, SOx, HF, NOx, as well as tar\nand char [20]. Other approaches to PCB recycling include hydrometallurgical\n[27,28] and pyrometallurgical [29] methods. The hydrometallurgical method is a\ncombination of mechanical refining, leaching, separation\u2013purification, and\nmetal recovery. It involves the production of a significant amount of liquid\nwaste and sludge. The pyrometallurgical method is the combination of\nincineration, smelting, dressing, sintering, melting, and high-temperature\ngas-phase reactions in a furnace. The stages of incineration and smelting\ngenerate hazardous emissions such as dioxins, furans, halogens, and volatile\nmetals.\n\nThere are several methods to identify and evaluate the distribution,\ncomposition, morphology, and phases of different components in PCBs\n[30,31,32], including optical microscope analysis, synchrotron X-ray\ntomography, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy/energy\ndispersive spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy. The\nuncertainty in determining all these properties is known to be strongly\ndependent on the particle size and sample mass chosen for the analysis [31].\nThe reduction of particle size is an important pre-requisite for the\nsubsequent effective extraction of metals from associated nonmetal\nconstituents in PCBs. It is achieved by various mechanical means like energy-\nintensive milling [33] and even cryo-milling [34] involving losses of precious\nmetals in fine fractions. For analyzing the composition of pyrolysis products,\ngas chromatography (GC) is used. Fixed carbon, volatile matter, and ash\ncontents of the original PCB and solid residues of its pyrolysis are usually\ndetermined by the CHNS/O analyzers [35,36].\n\nIn this paper, we apply a new method for recycling waste PCBs, which is\nreferred to as the high-temperature thermo-mechano-chemical gasification\n(TMCG) of PCBs by the detonation-born GA, that is the ultra-superheated\nmixture of H_2O and CO_2. The detonation-born GA with a temperature exceeding\n2000 \u00b0C is produced in a pulsed detonation gun (PDG) operating on any\navailable gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon fuel using gaseous oxygen or air as\noxidizer [37]. In the detonation gun, the fuel\u2013oxidizer mixture is converted\nto the high-temperature combustion products (mainly H_2O and CO_2) due to\noverall exothermic self-accelerating chemical reactions induced by volumetric\ncompression and heating in a strong, self-sustaining shock wave (SW). The PDG\noperates in a pulsed mode producing pulsed supersonic jets of GA and pulsed\nSWs possessing a huge destructive power. When the PDG is attached to a compact\nflow reactor filled with waste PCBs, the PCBs are subject to intense thermo-\nmechano-chemical action of both strong SWs and high-temperature supersonic\njets of GA in powerful vortical structures established in the flow reactor\n[38]. The SWs grind waste PCBs into fine particles, which can undergo multiple\nacts of fragmentation by the successive incident and reflected SWs, as well as\nundergo repeated involvement and gasification in the high-temperature vortical\nstructures of the GA. The ability of the GA composed of H_2O and CO_2 to\ngasify organic wastes, producing no negative effects on the environment, is\nwell known [39]. At temperatures above 1500 \u00b0C, tar and char formed at the\ninitial stages of the gasification process are completely transformed into\nsyngas, ideally composed only of H_2 and CO in a proportion depending on the\nfeedstock, whereas condensed mineral residues consist of safe, simple oxides\nand aqueous solutions of oxygen-free acids, such as HCl, HF, and H_2S, and\nammonia NH_3.\n\nThe TMCG method has already been successfully demonstrated for the natural gas\nconversion [40] and gasification of liquid/solid wastes (waste machine oil,\nsawdust, sunflower seed husks, etc.) [40,41,42,43]. The objective of this\npaper is to demonstrate the TMCG method on the gasification of waste PCBs\nusing a new experimental setup and accompanying measurements of gaseous and\nsolid gasification products by the chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS),\nCHN analysis, wet laser diffraction method, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF).\n\n## 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 show the schematic and photographs of the experimental\nsetup. The setup consists of a 40 L volume vertical flow reactor, a PDG, and\nan exhaust cleaning system. The PDG is attached tangentially to the flow\nreactor at its bottom. The PDG is a tube with an internal diameter of 50 mm, a\nlength of 900 mm, and a volume of 1.8 L, equipped with a mixing and ignition\ndevice, a cooling jacket, and ports for ionization probes (IPs) used for\nmeasuring the detonation propagation velocity. A near-stoichiometric natural\ngas\u2013oxygen mixture with a fuel-to-oxygen equivalence ratio of 0.92 \u00b1 0.03 is\nused as a combustible gas for the PDG and as a source for high-temperature GA.\nThe average mixture flow rate through the PDG is 3.2 \u00b1 0.2 g/s. A batch of\nfeedstock (waste PCBs) is loaded into the flow reactor through the top hatch.\nThe solid residue is unloaded through the lower hatch. Gases are removed from\nthe flow reactor through the central channel, passing through the top hatch\nwith a flow section diameter of 15 mm. The outlet channel is recessed relative\nto the top hatch by 100 mm. There are also ports for a low-frequency pressure\nsensor Kurant-DA 1.6 MPa (Russia) and N-type thermocouple Owen DTPN286M\n\u201340/+1250C (Russia) on the top of the flow reactor.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic of the experimental setup: 1 is the mixing and ignition\ndevice, 2 are the spark plugs, 3 is the PDG, 4 is the cooling system, 5 is the\nflow reactor, 6 is the sampling system for gaseous products, 7 is the\nionization probes (IPs), 8 is the oxygen and fuel line valves, 9 is the\nreducers, 10 is the pressure sensors, 11 is the oxygen receiver, 12 is the\nnatural gas receiver, 13 is the oxygen cylinder, 14 is the natural gas\ncylinder.\n\nFigure 2. Photographs of the experimental setup (a) and the cleaning system of\ngasification products (b).\n\nGas composition is measured by the flow gas analyzer MRU VARIO SYNGAS PLUS\n(Germany) and by Chromatec-Crystal 2000 (Russia) and GC-MS Chromatec-Crystal\n5000 (Russia) gas chromatographs. The granulometric analysis of the ash powder\nin the solid residue is performed by the wet laser diffraction method using\nAnalysette 22 device (Fritch, Idar-Oberstein, Germany). The elemental\ncomposition of the solid residue is determined by CHN analysis using CHNS/O\nanalyzer (Vario EL cube, Langenselbold, Germany) with accuracy of 0.30 vol%\nabs. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of solid residue samples are\ncarried out by the XRF technique using SPECTROSCAN MAX-GVM (Russia).\n\nThe exhaust gas cleaning system consists of two 2 L identical cyclones\n(cyclones #1 and #2 in Figure 2b) separated by three water-cooled sections for\ncooling the gasification products. The cyclones are designed for centrifugal\nseparation of solid particles and do not contain filtering elements. At the\nend of the cleaning system there is an ejection-type burner for burning\nflammable gasification products and visual monitoring of the process. The\nburner is equipped with a pilot flame system so that the gasification products\ncan be readily ignited and burned in a torch. The burning time of the torch on\nthe burner is treated as the characteristic time of the TMCG of organic\ncompounds in waste PCBs.\n\nThe feedstock consisted of waste PCBs of FR-2 type cut into pieces ranging in\nsize from 10 10 mm to 30 30 mm with various attached electronic components\n(Figure 3). The basis of PCB is textolite consisting of layers of fiberglass\nand an adhesive (compound) base, the complete removal of which is the goal of\nthe work. The elemental composition of waste PCBs was not analyzed.\n\nFigure 3. The feed e-waste: (a) PCBs and (b) PCBs potted with an organic\ncompound.\n\nThe detonation velocity in the PDG is determined based on the recordings of\ntwo IPs (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). Figure 4 shows the typical recordings of\nthe IPs in 14 successive cycles of the PDG and the exploded view of the\nrecordings in a single cycle. Based on such recordings, we determine the\ndetonation velocity as the ratio of the known distance between the IPs ( 250\nmm) to the time interval between signals, . In experiments, the measured\ndetonation velocity in the natural gas\u2013oxygen mixture is 2100 \u00b1 100 m/s. Table\n1 shows the composition of the natural gas consisting mainly (96.1 vol%) of\nmethane. Table 2 shows the composition of the GA\u2014the mixture of ultra-\nsuperheated H_2O and CO_2\u2014measured in the experiments without supply of waste\nPCBs using the flow gas analyzer MRU VARIO SYNGAS PLUS (Germany); the\nmeasurement error is estimated at 5%.\n\nFigure 4. Recordings of ionization probes during setup operation.\n\nTable 1. Compositions of natural gas.\n\nTable 2. Measured composition of the gasifying agent.\n\nThe PCBs are processed according to the following algorithm. Firstly, a batch\nof PCBs (1 kg) is loaded into the flow reactor. Then, the data acquisition\nsystem, as well as the exhaust cooling system and the PDG, are activated.\nThereafter, the cyclic operation of the PDG is started with a preset\nfrequency. In the flow reactor, with the cyclic generation of strong SWs and\nthe injection of high-temperature GA, the PCBs are heated, fragmented, and\ngasified while formed heavy and light particles of the solid residue are\nspatially separated in the intense vortical flow. Due to differences in\ndensity and mass, particles of different sizes settle at different speeds and\noccupy their own areas along the flow reactor height. Thus, the flow reactor\npartially performs the functions of a cyclone when solid particles move along\nthe walls, and gas is taken from the center of the vortex and escapes from the\nflow reactor through the recessed outlet channel. When the mean temperature in\nthe upper part of the flow reactor reaches 200 \u00b0C (in about 20 s from the\nstart of setup operation), a flame torch appears on the exhaust burner,\nindicating the beginning of the gasification of organic compounds. The\nchromatographic probes of the gas escaping from the flow reactor are taken in\n40 s from the start of setup operation during the time interval of 20 s. The\nmain gasification phase ends when the flame torch on the burner spontaneously\nquenches. The processed solid residue is extracted from the reactor and both\ncyclones in 1 h after feedstock TMCG and analyzed. This time is needed to cool\ndown the flow reactor and cyclones and to dismantle the shut-off elements. In\nan industrial prototype, this period can be readily reduced to several\nminutes.\n\n## 3\\. Results and Discussion\n\nThe substrate of PCBs consists of flammable substances with some ash content.\nTo assess the ash content of PCBs, annealing was first carried out with a\nnatural gas\u2013oxygen flame torch. Figure 5 shows the photographs of PCB elements\nbefore and after annealing. After annealing 50 g of PCB substrate (textolite)\nwithout attached electronic elements, its weight decreases by 15 g, which\nindicates an ash content of 70% of pure textolite. Annealing 50 g of some\n\u201caverage\u201d set of PCBs with attached electronic elements shows that their ash\ncontent of 80%. Thus, it is expected that during gasification, the mass of\nfeedstock must decrease by 15\u201320 wt%. If one accounts for possible solid mass\nremoval from the flow reactor with the escaping gas, the total mass loss can\nbe somewhat higher. Thus, annealing experiments show that the initial\ncomposition of PCBs includes organic components (15\u201320 wt%), fiberglass (35\u201345\nwt%), and electronic components (35\u201350 wt%).\n\nFigure 5. Elements of PCBs before and after annealing: (a) substrate only, (b)\noriginal substrate with attached electronic elements, and (c) processed\nsubstrate with attached electronic elements.\n\nIt is conditionally assumed that the \u201cfull\u201d gasification of organic matter\nfrom the waste PCBs is attained when the carbon content in the solid residue\nof TMCG is less than 2 wt%. In the process of searching for the best operation\nmode of the gasification setup aimed at attaining full gasification of organic\nmatter, we varied the following parameters: (1) the setup operation time and\n(2) the PDG operation frequency (1 or 2 Hz).\n\nFigure 6 shows the typical time history of overpressure in the flow reactor\nmeasured by the pressure sensor. The overpressure in the flow reactor during\nsetup operation does not usually exceed 0.4 MPa. Figure 7 shows the typical\ntime history of the mean gas temperature in the flow reactor measured by the\nthermocouple. Note that the measured mean gas temperature should not be\ntreated as the gasification temperature, as gasification reactions occur\ninside the flow reactors at local instantaneous temperatures of the GA\ngenerated by the PDG. Thus, at the operation frequency of 1 Hz, the local\ninstantaneous maximum temperature of the GA inside the flow reactor during the\nfirst quarter of the cycle (~0.25 s) is very high (1500 < < 2300 K) [40],\nwhile in the second quarter of the cycle, it drops to 1200 < < 1500 K and\nfurther drops below 1200 K in the second half of the cycle. The drop in the GA\ntemperature is caused by the expansion of high-pressure detonation products\nbehind the detonation wave to the actual pressure in the flow reactor and by\nmixing the newly produced ultra-superheated GA with the cooled gas in the flow\nreactor. Calculations show [40] that the time-averaged mean gas temperature in\nthe flow reactor is not much affected by the reactor wall temperature. This\nmeans that the walls of the flow reactor can be water-cooled and manufactured\nfrom conventional structural materials. In Figure 6 and Figure 7, the\ngasification time of the PCBs is shown by vertical dashed lines. The time is\ncounted from the beginning of the first PDG operation cycle until the flame\ntorch in the exhaust gas burner is spontaneously quenched. It follows from\nFigure 6 and Figure 7 that the characteristic time for the experimental setup\nto reach a quasi-stationary pressure regime in the flow reactor is about 150 s\n(see Figure 6), while the average gas temperature in the flow reactor is\nestablished only after the end of gasification (see Figure 7).\n\nFigure 6. Typical time history of the measured mean overpressure in the flow\nreactor at a PDG operation frequency of 2 Hz.\n\nFigure 7. Typical time history of the measured gas temperature at the top of\nflow reactor at a PDG operation frequency of 2 Hz.\n\nExperiments show that the gasification time and the consumption of a\ncombustible methane\u2013oxygen mixture at a PDG frequency of 2 Hz, required for\nfull gasification of organic substances in a 1 kg batch of PCBs, are 240 s and\n1.4 kg, respectively. When the PDG operates at a frequency of 1 Hz, full\ngasification of organic substances in the PCBs requires more time (350 s) but\nless combustible mixture (about 1.0 kg). Thus, an operation frequency of 1 Hz\nis preferable for economic reasons but less preferable in terms of\nperformance.\n\nNow, let us consider the properties of the gasification products and solid\nresidues. Figure 8 and Table 3 show a typical GC-MS chromatogram and\ncomposition of the gas mixture produced by the gasification of waste PCBs at a\nPDG frequency of 2 Hz, respectively. The gas is mainly composed of CO_2 (52.2\nvol%), CO (25.1 vol%), H_2 (15.7 vol%), N_2 (3.4 vol%), and CH_4 (2.3 vol%).\nThe share of flammable gas components is seen to reach about 45 vol%. The\nqualitative analysis indicates that in addition to the main components listed\nin Table 3, the gas mixture contains some tar in terms of benzene and its\nhomologs. Figure 9 and Table 4 show a typical GC-MS chromatogram and tar\ncomposition in terms of the match with the NIST 20 database, respectively.\nAccording to [39], tar must disappear with an increase in the mean\ngasification temperature, i.e., with an increase in the PDG operation\nfrequency, when the duration of the period of the highest temperatures\nexceeding 2000 \u00b0C increases. In view of this, there is an evident trade-off\nbetween economic and ecological considerations: despite the operation\nfrequency of 2 Hz seeming unpreferable compared to 1 Hz from an economic\nperspective, it must be preferable from an ecological perspective. Obviously,\nfor complete gasification of PCBs, it is necessary to increase the PDG\noperation frequency.\n\nFigure 8. A typical chromatogram of the gas mixture produced by the\ngasification of waste PCBs at a PDG operation frequency of 2 Hz.\n\nFigure 9. A chromatogram indicating the existence of benzene and its homologs\nin the gas mixture produced by the gasification of waste PCBs in the setup\nwith the PDG operation frequency of 2 Hz.\n\nTable 3. The typical composition of the exhaust gas at a PDG operation\nfrequency of 2 Hz.\n\nTable 4. Heavy hydrocarbon impurities in the gas mixture produced by the\ngasification of waste PCBs in the setup at a PDG operation frequency of 2 Hz.\n\nFigure 10 shows the photographs of the solid residues of the gasification of\nPCBs (Figure 10a) and PCBs potted with an organic compound (Figure 10b). The\nsolid residues are composed of fine powder and metal inclusions. As can be\nseen, some metal inclusions, which could contain precious metals inside, like\nbody parts, are deformed rather than destroyed. Obviously, to open such body\nparts, one has to apply a larger-diameter PDG to generate stronger blast\nwaves.\n\nFigure 10. Photographs of the solid residues of the gasification of PCBs (a)\nand PCBs filled with an organic compound (b).\n\nTo obtain the particle size distribution in the powder, the solid residues are\nfirst manually freed from visible (macroscopic) metallic inclusions, and then\nthree specimens are taken from different places of each sample and analyzed by\nwet laser diffraction. Figure 11 presents an example of particle size\ndistributions in the powder. About 30% of all particles possess a size of less\nthan 10 \u03bcm, whereas the rest 70% possess a size in the range from 10 to 100\n\u03bcm. Such a fine powder is the result of the thermo-mechano-chemical action of\nstrong pulsed SWs emanating from the PDG. Table 5 compares particle size\ndistributions for five different samples of PCBs in terms of the average of\nthree measurements for each sample. Samples 1 and 2 are taken from the flow\nreactor, whereas samples 3, 4, and 5 are taken from the exhaust cleaning\nsystem upon the completion of experiments: samples 3 and 4 are taken from\ncyclone #1, and sample 5 is taken from cyclone #2 (see Figure 2b). The\nparticles of the largest size (200\u2013400 \u03bcm) are seen to accumulate in the flow\nreactor, whereas the smallest particles (20\u201330 \u03bcm) are removed from the flow\nreactor with the escaping gas and trapped by the cyclones in the exhaust\ncleaning system. The overwhelming majority (80\u2013100%) of particles in the flow\nreactor have submillimeter sizes. Metal inclusions of all visible sizes\naccumulate only in the flow reactor and are not detected in samples extracted\nfrom the cyclones. The particles trapped in cyclone #1 appear to be larger\nthan those trapped in cyclone #2: the fraction of the smallest submicron\nparticles in cyclone #2 is a factor of 3\u20134 larger than in cyclone #1. In\ngeneral, all particles, extracted from the flow reactor and both cyclones have\na submillimeter size. One important circumstance should be noted here: when\nsumming up the material balance, it turns out that a part of the solid mass is\nremoved from the flow reactor with the escaping gas (about 20 wt% of the\ninitial solid mass of the PCBs (fiberglass and electronic components) and only\npartly (about 10 wt%) captured by the exhaust cleaning system. The fate of the\nremaining 10 wt% of the solid mass is currently unclear. Apparently, tiny\n(submicron) particles settle on the internal surfaces of the flow reactor and\nthe exhaust cleaning system and/or are not captured by the cleaning system and\nenter the flame torch along with the escaping gas. These assumptions will be\ntested during further work, for example, by installing fine filters upstream\nof the burner.\n\nFigure 11. An example of particle size distributions obtained by the wet laser\ndiffraction method. The curves correspond to three specimens taken from\ndifferent places of a powder sample.\n\nTable 5. Particle size distributions in the powder for five sets of PCBs after\nTMCG (%).\n\nTable 6 shows the elemental composition of the powder determined by sample\nburning in the CHNS/O analyzer. The samples in Table 6 are the same as in\nTable 5. When burning samples 1 and 2, the remaining ash mass appears to be\nabove 100 wt%. Perhaps the increase in mass occurs due to the oxidation of\ninorganic components in the powder. In addition, the amount of carbon in\nsamples 1 and 2 turns out to be an order of magnitude lower than in samples 3,\n4, and 5, while hydrogen and nitrogen are not detected at all. This indicates\nthe full gasification (over 98 wt%) of organic compounds in samples 1 and 2\nafter the TMCG of waste PCBs. As for the gasification degree of samples 3, 4,\nand 5, it ranges from 76 wt% to 91 wt%, while the ash content in these samples\nranges from 70 to 90 wt%. These results indicate that the particles removed\nfrom the flow reactor with escaping gas are only partly gasified. There are\nseveral approaches to solving the problem of increasing the gasification\nefficiency of organic feedstocks during their TMCG, which are discussed in\n[37]. One of them is the use of a cascade of communicating flow reactors,\nallowing gases and particles to move from one flow reactor to another, which\nincreases the average residence time of waste particles in the high-\ntemperature GA and, therefore, increases the gasification efficiency.\n\nTable 6. Data on the elemental composition of the powders obtained by the TMCG\nof waste PCBs.\n\nThe qualitative analysis of samples presented in Table 5 and Table 6 by the\nXRF method shows that the powders obtained by the TMCG of waste PCBs contain\nSn, Pb, Cu, Ni, Fe, In, Cd, Zn, Ca, Si, Al, Ti, Ni, and Cl. It should be\nreiterated that most of the metals were extracted prior to the analyses, and\ntherefore, their amounts in Table 7 are related only to some residues in the\npowders. In the powders submitted for analysis, precious elements Ag, Au, and\nPt are not detected. This means that these elements (if any) remain in\nextracted metallic inclusions. Since calcium, silicon, and aluminum are the\ncomponents of fiberglass, these elements are detected in all samples. The\nremaining elements are detected as tiny parts of electronic components and\nsolder. Table 7 shows the mineral composition of the powders. The samples are\nthe same as in Table 5 and Table 6. As seen, the powders contain tin (10\u201320\nwt%), lead (5\u201310 wt%), copper (up to 1.5 wt%), and iron (up to 1 wt%). Also\npresent are zinc, indium, cadmium, and nickel.\n\nTable 7. Composition of the powders obtained by the TMCG of waste PCBs (wt%).\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions\n\nThus, we experimentally demonstrated a new high-temperature thermo-mechano-\nchemical method of PCB gasification by the detonation-born gasification agent\ncomposed of the ultra-superheated H_2O-CO_2 mixture. For the demonstration, a\nnew experimental setup and accompanying measurements of gaseous and solid\ngasification products by chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, CHN analysis, wet\nlaser diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence are used. The detonation-born\ngasification agent with a temperature exceeding 2000 \u00b0C is produced in the PDG\noperating on detonations of near-stoichiometric natural gas\u2013oxygen mixture.\nThe PDG produces pulsed supersonic jets of the gasifying agent and pulsed\nshock waves in the flow reactor with a batch of waste PCBs, thus exerting\nintense thermo-mechano-chemical action on the waste, leading to its fine\ngrinding and gasification. The following main findings are worth emphasizing:\n\n  * A high degree of gasification of organic matter in the flow reactor is achieved, which is over 98 wt%. Some solid mass (about 20 wt% of the processed PCBs) is removed from the flow reactor with the escaping gas in the form of very fine powder particles and is partly (about 10 wt%) trapped by the cyclones in the exhaust cleaning system. Metal inclusions of all visible sizes accumulate only in the flow reactor and are not detected in powder samples extracted from the cyclones. The gasification efficiency of the particles removed from the flow reactor with the escaping gas ranges from 76 to 91 wt%, i.e., the removed solid particles are not fully gasified. This problem can be eliminated, e.g., by using fine filters and/or the cascade of communicating flow reactors.\n\n  * The full gasification of organic substances in a 1 kg batch of PCBs is attained by PDG operation at a frequency of 2 Hz during about 240 s with the overall consumption of a combustible natural gas\u2013oxygen mixture of 1.4 kg. When the PDG operates at a frequency of 1 Hz, full gasification of organic substances in the PCBs requires more time (350 s) but less combustible mixture (about 1.0 kg). Thus, an operation frequency of 1 Hz is preferable for economic reasons but less preferable in terms of performance.\n\n  * The gaseous products of PCB gasification are mainly composed of CO_2 (52.2 vol%), CO (25.1 vol%), H_2 (15.7 vol%), N_2 (3.4 vol%), and CH_4 (2.3 vol%) with the share of flammable gas components reaching about 45 vol%. At the PDG operation frequency of 2 Hz, the gaseous products still contain some amounts of tar in terms of benzene and its homologs. The tar must disappear with the increase in the PDG operation frequency, i.e., to improve the environmental friendliness of PCB gasification products, it is necessary to increase the PDG operation frequency above 2 Hz.\n\n  * The solid residues of PCB gasification are composed of fine powder with visible metal inclusions. With metal inclusions extracted, the powder is composed of particles possessing a size less than 300\u2013400 \u03bcm, including a large fraction of sizes less than 100 \u03bcm. This is the result of the thermo-mechano-chemical action of strong pulsed shock waves emanating from the PDG.\n\n  * After the extraction of metal inclusions, the powder obtained by the thermo-mechano-chemical gasification of waste PCBs contain Sn, Pb, Cu, Ni, Fe, In, Cd, Zn, Ca, Si, Al, Ti, Ni, and Cl. Among these substances, Sn (10\u201320 wt%), Pb (5\u201310 wt%), and Cu (up to 1.5 wt%) are detected in the maximum amounts. In the powder submitted for analysis, precious elements Ag, Au, and Pt are not detected, i.e., these elements (if any) remain in metallic inclusions.\n\nFuture work will be focused on improving the efficiency of the thermo-mechano-\nchemical processing of waste PCBs by (1) decreasing the amount of solid mass\nremoved from the flow reactor with the escaping gas and (2) increasing the\nrate of conversion of condensable hydrocarbons in gaseous gasification\nproducts with an increase in the PDG operation frequency.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, S.M.F.; methodology, S.M.F. and V.A.S.; formal analysis,\nS.M.F., V.A.S., A.S.S. and I.A.S.; investigation, S.M.F., V.A.S., A.S.S.,\nI.A.S., F.S.F. and J.K.H.; resources, A.A.S. and V.E.S.; data curation, A.S.S.\nand I.A.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.M.F.; writing\u2014review and\nediting, S.M.F.; supervision, S.M.F.; project administration, S.M.F.; funding\nacquisition, S.M.F.
