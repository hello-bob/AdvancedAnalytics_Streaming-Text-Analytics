It\u2019s easy\nto understand why. Publishing is an opaque industry, and Griffin\u2019s piece\u2014which\ncollects quotes and statistics from the 2022 Justice Department suit against\nPenguin Random House, in which the government successfully blocked PRH\u2019s $2.2\nbillion purchase of Simon & Schuster\u2014is filled with shocking claims. Over 90\npercent of books sell fewer than 1,000 copies; 50 percent of books sell fewer\nthan 12 copies. The article paints a nearly apocalyptic portrait of\ntraditional publishing, in which nothing works, few make money, nobody reads,\nand the whole industry might go poof at any moment. This vision is appealing\nto many people, including writers who (fairly or unfairly) feel stymied by the\nindustry, popularists who think reading itself is a snobby hobby, and tech\ntypes who mock \u201cpaywalled dead trees.\u201d The only problem is, the picture isn\u2019t\ntrue.\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nLet me say first that Griffin does an admirable job collecting these quotes,\nand much of the overall thrust is correct: Most people don\u2019t buy books, sales\nfor most titles are lower than many think, and big publishing works on a\nblockbuster model where a few hits\u2014plus perennial backlist sellers\u2014comprise\nthe bulk of sales. It\u2019s also true that books don\u2019t occupy as central a place\nin the culture as they did before film, streaming TV, video games, and social\nmedia fragmented culture. (That ship sailed many decades ago, however.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, many of the statistics here are wrong or misleading in part because\nthey were intended to be. PRH\u2019s legal strategy was to present publishing as an\nimperiled, dying industry beset on all sides by threats like Amazon\u2014a\ncharacterization intended to convince the court that a merger was necessary\nfor publishing\u2019s survival. There may be truth to that idea, and I\u2019m not saying\nany of the quotes are lies. I\u2019m saying the quotes and statistics are tailored\ntoward a specific narrative in the context of a legal battle. So, read them\nwith a $2.2 billion\u2013sized grain of salt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore we dive into numbers, though, let\u2019s step back and look at the biggest\nquestion: Do people buy books?\n\n###\n\nAmericans Buy Over 1 Billion Books a Year\n\nHow many books are sold in the United States? The only reliable tracker we\nhave is Circana BookScan, which logs point of sale\u2014i.e., customer purchases at\nstores, websites, etc.\u2014for most of the print market. BookScan counted 767\nmillion print sales in 2023. It collects this data directly from reporting\nbookstores, chains, and online retailers that combine for the majority of the\nmarket. BookScan claims to cover 85 percent of print sales, although many in\npublishing think the percentage is smaller. Many books sold at book festivals\nor in-person at readings are not reported to BookScan, for example, nor are\nlibrary sales. (Almost every author will tell you that their royalty reports\nshow notably more sales than BookScan captures, sometimes by orders of\nmagnitude.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, I\u2019ll be conservative and assume that 85 percent is the correct figure.\nThis means that close to 900 million print books are sold to customers each\nyear. Add in e-books and the quickly growing audiobook market, and the total\nnumber of new books sold is over 1 billion. Again, this is a conservative\nestimate. And it does not include used book sales or library purchases.\nAmericans do buy books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs 1-billion-plus a lot of books? This depends on your point of view. For\ncomparison\u2019s sake, there were 825 million movie tickets sold in the U.S. and\nCanada in 2023. So, more books are purchased than movie tickets, two\ncomparable entertainment options in terms of price. On the other hand, that\u2019s\n\u201cnew movies in theaters\u201d vs. \u201call books available for sale from throughout\nhistory.\u201d Movies are vastly more expensive to make, so far fewer movies are\nreleased each year than books are published. Individual movies are watched far\nmore than most individual books are read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether or not this \u201c1 billion books\u201d number is big, it\u2019s fairly stable. Print\nbook sales have not been decimated by digital sales/streaming in the way of so\nmany other industries. Despite the introduction of e-books, various attempts\nat \u201cNetflix for Books\u201d services such as Oyster and Scribd, and endless cries\nabout the death of publishing ... print sales have increased in recent years,\nbefore even accounting for the millions of e-books sold and the audiobook\nmarket. Publishing is an industry with plenty of problems\u2014believe me, I\nknow\u2014but there\u2019s no reason to think it\u2019s on its deathbed.\n\n###\n\nWhy It\u2019s So Easy to Mislead With Book Statistics\n\nIn the world of lies, damned lies, and statistics, book stats are especially\neasy to manipulate. I\u2019ve already mentioned that BookScan doesn\u2019t track all\nprint purchases and that the stats typically don\u2019t include e-books or\naudiobooks. But there are lots of ways\u2014if, say, you are trying to persuade a\njudge to allow a big corporate merger\u2014to manipulate these numbers to mislead:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * Many of the quotes from the trial seem to reference calendar year sales\u2014meaning they include books that have been out for only a week or a month\u2014instead of a reasonable time frame like two years, much less lifetime sales.\n\n  * Overall book sale stats apply to all books from throughout history that are still in publication. A bestseller from 1924 or 1824 might sell only 10 copies in calendar year 2024, but it might have reached 1 million in lifetime sales.\n\n  * BookScan tracks by ISBNs, meaning what most people think of as a single book\u2014e.g., one novel\u2014actually counts as multiple books. My novel The Body Scout came out in four formats with different ISBNs, and so it counts as four separate books: hardcover, paperback, e-book, and audiobook. The same is true for almost every book published.\n\n  * Certain types of books, like some academic texts, are barely sold in the general marketplace at all, even if they have an ISBN.\n\n  * \u201cBooks\u201d as a category includes everything from novels and memoirs to crossword puzzle collections and adult coloring books.\n\n  * \u201cPublishers\u201d includes everything from big corporate publishers to small presses to academic presses that don\u2019t really sell in bookstores to serious self-published authors to amateur self-published authors who may have no expectations at all of sales but just want to put a collection of cat poems out for their grandkids.\n\nI hope you can see where I\u2019m going with this. What the average Big 5\u2013published\nbook sells in one calendar year is a completely different number from what it\nsells over a lifetime. That number is completely different from the average\nbook sales of all publishers, from micropresses to big corporate publishers.\nAnd that number would be completely different from the average sale of books,\nincluding the millions of self-published books.\n\nAnd within any of those numbers, the statistics vary wildly by type of book.\nThink about movies again. When people talk about movie revenue, they\u2019re\nprobably restricting themselves to feature films released in theaters or\nmovies streaming on big platforms like Netflix. (The closemouthed way the\nlatter handles its data has already famously mucked up movie stats.) But\n\u201cbooks\u201d encompass everything from niche academic monographs and Sudoku puzzle\ncollections to bestselling novels and memoirs. It would be as if \u201cmovie\u201d\nstatistics included educational videos, online porn streaming, and TikToks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy point isn\u2019t that there\u2019s anything bad about self-published cat poems,\ncrossword puzzles, TikToks, or anything like that. My point is that \u201caverage\nbook sales\u201d tell you almost nothing about, say, how well the average novel\npublished by a big press, and widely available in bookstores, sells. (To be\nfair, this also means that the billion-plus number above includes lots of\nthings we wouldn\u2019t normally think of as books.) I went into greater depth\nabout book stats here.\n\n###\n\nUnderstanding How Books Earn Money\n\nThere\u2019s also a lot of confusion in book publishing because the economics are\nboth complicated and obscured. Confusion is common. I\u2019ll look at just one\nexample from the original article, because it illustrates two common\nmisunderstandings:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n> Books don\u2019t make money\n>\n> If I look at the top 10 percent of books ... that 10 percent level gets you\n> to about 300,000 copies sold in that year. And if you told me I\u2019m definitely\n> going to sell 300,000 copies in a year, I would spend many millions of\n> dollars to get that book.\n>\n> \u2014Madeline McIntosh, CEO, Penguin Random House US\n>\n> Publishing houses pay millions of dollars for a book that sells only 300,000\n> copies??? Well, because books don\u2019t sell a lot of copies, they don\u2019t make a\n> lot of money. ...\n>\n> According to [consultant Nicholas] Hill, 85 percent of the books with\n> advances of $250,000 and up never earn out their advance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcIntosh said 300,000 copies \u201cin a year\u201d rather than in lifetime sales, so we\nare talking calendar-year sales, not lifetime sales. (See above.) A book that\nsold \u201conly\u201d 300,000 in one year is going to sell many more copies in other\nyears. It has a good chance of being a perennial backlist seller, even. That\nis the goal of any publisher, since they sell with almost no overhead or\nmarketing costs. Such a book would certainly make many, many millions for a\npublisher. What company wouldn\u2019t pay millions if they were \u201cdefinitely going\u201d\nto make even more millions back? Business 101.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the above quote also might give the impression that books \u201cdon\u2019t make\nmoney\u201d when they don\u2019t earn out advances. This is a common misconception. A\nbook can be profitable for a publisher well before the author earns out the\nadvance. (If you don\u2019t know, an advance is money paid upfront to an author.\nAuthors don\u2019t earn royalties until a publisher has made back that advance\nmoney out of the author\u2019s per-sale share.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actual math of bookselling is complicated since royalty rates vary by\nformat, price points can fluctuate, and big publishers have different\ndistribution deals from small ones. That said, I\u2019ll do a bit of simplistic\nnapkin math to explain.\n\nLet\u2019s say the average book sells for $20. Of that, about half goes to the\nretailer and distributor and the other half to the publisher. Of the\npublisher\u2019s $10, about $1 goes to pay back the advance\u2014or to royalties when\nthe book \u201cearns out.\u201d (Again, I\u2019m simplifying. Standard royalty rates are\nbetween 7.5 percent and 25 percent, depending on format.) So, if a book sells\n1 million copies, then the publisher makes $10 million, with $1 million going\ntoward earning out the author\u2019s advance. If the publisher paid an advance of\n$3 million, the author hasn\u2019t earned out ... but the publisher still made $7\nmillion in revenue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not profit. Publishers have expenses to pay back, including the costs\nof printing the book and marketing. Economies of scale come in here. But you\ncan see how books can be profitable well before advances are earned out.\nIndeed, here\u2019s another quote from Griffin\u2019s article, from Simon & Schuster CEO\nJonathan Karp, that supports that: \u201cAbout half of the books we publish make\nmoney, and a much lower percentage of them earn back the advance we pay.\u201d\nAlong these lines, it\u2019s a myth that a book that hasn\u2019t earned out is a\nfailure. It\u2019s even possible to have a long and lucrative career without ever\nearning out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might think that only 50 percent of books making money for the publisher\nis a bad thing, but most comparable industries operate this way. In\nentertainment, a few big winners have always funded the rest.\n\n###\n\nWhat Does Your Average Novel Sell?\n\nI assume most people reading both Griffin\u2019s article and this one don\u2019t care\nabout the sales of adult coloring books and pocket copies of the Constitution\nand so on. What they\u2019re interested in are the sales of what most people think\nof when they hear the word books: novels, biographies, essay collections,\nstory collections, and the like. So, cutting through the noise, how do those\nsell?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, you can\u2019t really say. The answer depends on the type and genre of book\nand the type of publisher. Someone from a prestige Big 5 imprint whose books\nare often award contenders and bestsellers once told me any book that sold\nfewer than 25,000 in print was a failure for the publisher. On the other hand,\nmany literary fiction writers have told me that anything more than 5,000 sales\nis a success. So, some small-press editors might be happy with 1,000 sales.\n\nWhat I can say is that no book you\u2019re likely to have heard of is selling only\n12 copies or anything near that. Most new books in bookstores are selling, at\na minimum, hundreds of copies and most of the time thousands. The popular ones\nare selling tens of thousands, and the breakout hits are selling hundreds of\nthousands or even millions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would add here that it\u2019s not true that only movie star memoirs and James\nPatterson\u2013type commercial thrillers are breakout hits. The NYT bestseller list\noften includes award winners, and so-called literary fiction titles like The\nGoldfinch and All the Light We Cannot See can sell in the millions. And many\nauthors earn a living\u2014or, if not a living, then a significant chunk of a\nliving\u2014from their books without ever becoming as famous as Stephen King or\nDanielle Steel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying all is great in publishing land. Certainly, I wish that\nthe novels I love were selling millions instead of thousands of copies. But I\nimagine few are shocked that books in 2024 do not occupy the place in the\nculture they did 100 years ago, before video games, cellphones, social media,\nstreaming TV, and the like dominated our time.\n\nOne telling summary from Griffin\u2019s article was this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n> Penguin Random House US has guidelines for who gets what advance:\n>\n> Category 1: Lead titles with a sales goal of 75,000 units and up\n>\n> Advance: $500,000 and up\n>\n> Category 2: Titles with a sales goal of 25,000\u201375,000 units\n>\n> Advance: $150,000\u2013$500,000\n>\n> Category 3: Titles with a sales goal of 10,000\u201325,000 units\n>\n> Advance: $50,000\u2013$150,000\n>\n> Category 4: Titles with a sales goal of 5,000 to 10,000 units\n>\n> Advance: $50,000 or less\n\nThis seems like a fair look at the relationship between advances and big\npublishers\u2019 expectations. The lowest sales target is in the thousands.\nObviously, many books will fail to hit their targets, though typically not by\n4,988 copies. On the other end, anything selling more than 75,000 is a rare\nhit. If you\u2019re on a big publisher, you are likely to sell a few thousand\ncopies. If you\u2019re lucky, tens of thousands. If you\u2019re exceptionally lucky,\nhundreds of thousands or millions.\n\n###\n\nAdding in E-book and Audio Numbers\n\nThe above are, I think, just print sales. E-book and audio sales are trickier\nto handle because of subscription services and because prices vary wildly for\nindividual titles. The Body Scout\u2014like most novels\u2014has routinely been put on\nKindle Daily Deals and the like, selling for $1.99\u2013$3.99 for limited periods\nof time. Industry professionals have told me that for most literary fiction\ntitles, e-book sales are about half of print sales. But for some genres,\nespecially science fiction and fantasy, e-book sales can easily exceed print\nsales. (For what it\u2019s worth, I just looked up the sales of The Body Scout, and\nit\u2019s almost exactly 50 percent hardcover/paperback and 50 percent\ne-book/audio.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Related From Slate\n\n#### Richard Kreitner\n\n### Ten Years Ago, His Book about Civilizational Collapse Got Unexpectedly\nPopular. He\u2019s Back With a Little Bit of Hope.\n\nRead More\n\n###\n\nSelling and Reading Are Different Things\n\nBut it\u2019s good to remember that everything talked about here is sales of new\nbooks, a category that is not the same as reading. Many people purchase used\nbooks or check out books from the library or borrow books from friends. And\nthat\u2019s not even getting into reading magazines, Substacks, and more. (Of\ncourse, people also buy lots of books they never read ...)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot I think publishers could change, including focusing on big\nadvance books and celebrity authors\u2014Griffin is quite right that those\nacquisitions often go bust, especially with social media celebrities.\nInstagram and TikTok followers rarely translate to book sales. And books are\ncertainly not at the center of culture in the way they were before TV and\nsocial media and all the rest.\n\nStill, books endure. Publishing is still chugging along, not just in the Big 5\npublishers\u2014which account for most of these stats\u2014but also in indie and small\npresses, where much of the best writing is published. If you want to keep the\nbooks coming, well, keep buying them and/or checking them out at your local\nlibrary.\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\n  * Books\n  * Economics\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Pitch Guidelines\n  * Send Us Tips\n  * Corrections\n  * Commenting\n  * Reprints\n\n#### Subscriptions\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Sign In\n  * Account\n  * Subscription FAQs\n  * Podcast FAQs\n  * Newsletters\n  * Customer Support\n\n#### Advertising\n\n  * AdChoices\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Feed\n\n  * User Agreement\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9 2024 The Slate Group LLC.
