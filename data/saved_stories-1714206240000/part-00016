DOI: 10.1038/s41557-023-01420-w\n\nUntil now, the generation and storage of electricity from solar energy has\nbeen dependent on various devices, leading to conversion losses. That may\nchange soon, as chemists at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg\n(FAU) and other research institutes in Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom,\nItaly, Sweden and the U.S. are conducting research into a hydrocarbon molecule\nthat can either convert sunlight into electricity or save the energy for a\nlong time in a chemical form.\n\nThis could pave the way for entirely new organic solar modules. The\nfundamentals for conversion and storage using the molecule have now been\npublished in the journal Nature Chemistry.\n\nHopes remain high that solar energy will be a major driver of the energy\ntransformation. However, as sunlight is a highly volatile source of energy, a\nsolution must be found for storing energy efficiently.\n\n\"Until now, we have transferred electricity from solar modules that is not\nconsumed immediately into a battery, where it can be used as and when\nrequired,\" explains Prof. Dr. Julien Bachmann, Chair of Chemistry of Thin Film\nMaterials (CTFM) at FAU. \"By repeatedly changing between chemical and\nelectrical energy, at least 30% of the original converted energy is lost\nduring this battery storage process.\"\n\nTogether with Michael Bosch, a doctoral candidate at the Chair CTFM, Bachmann\nhopes to coax a new property from a known material, making it either\nconverting sunlight to electrical energy or storing the energy, depending on\nrequirements. The material in question is norbornadiene, a hydrocarbon isomer\nconsisting of two molecule rings. If norbornadiene is exposed to ultraviolet\nlight, a partial reorganization of the atomic bonds leads to it converting to\nthe similarly structured but more highly strained quadricyclane.\n\n\"The conversion process is already known, however, research has focused until\nnow on recovering the stored energy in the form of heat,\" explains Bachmann.\n\"Our new approach involves controlling the process to allow the stored energy\nto be made available as electricity as well, even after months have passed.\"\n\nScientists still do not fully understand the physical-chemical mechanisms\nbehind the transitions between the isomers. Researchers from Australia, the\nUnited Kingdom, Italy, Sweden and the U.S. are working together with\ncolleagues from FAU to gain a better understanding of the process by using\nphotoelectron spectroscopy.\n\nBachmann states, \"The more we know about the dynamics of photo- and\nelectrochemical transformation, the better we can modify the design of the\nmolecule to suit the desired functions.\"\n\nThe aim of future research is, for example, not only to use ultraviolet\nexcitation, but also a wide spectrum of sunlight for electron excitation.\n\"There is a lot of potential,\" explains Bachmann. \"The pure energy density of\nthe norbornadiene-quadricyclane system is comparable to a lithium-ion\nbattery.\"\n\nIf researchers succeed in reliably controlling the reversible norbornadiene-\nquadricyclane conversion, this would not only lead to an efficient solar\nmodule that is also suitable for storing electricity. The organic hydrocarbon-\nbased material would also be cost-effective to produce, would not require rare\nmetals and would be easy to dispose of or recycle in an environmentally\nfriendly way at the end of its lifecycle.\n\nMore information: Kurtis D.
