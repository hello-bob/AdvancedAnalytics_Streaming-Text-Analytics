On some topics, I now write with more\nconfidence and, I hope, greater clarity. On other topics, I have different\nviews than I held then.\n\nSome excerpts:\n\n> The title Learning Economics has a double meaning. It suggests a book that\n> is intended to have educational value. However, it also refers to the\n> economy itself as a system for learning. . .Economic growth is due primarily\n> to the accumulation and successful application of knowledge.\n\n> to achieve prosperity, a country must foster three \u201cethics.\u201d\n>\n>   1. A work ethic\n>\n>   2. A public service ethic\n>\n>   3. A learning ethic\n>\n>\n\n>\n> The work ethic will exist if and only if people feel that work is fairly\n> rewarded. If instead it becomes evident that rewards accrue to those who\n> steal, deal in black markets, or serve a warlord or clan leader, then those\n> behaviors will be more widespread than work.\n>\n> ...A public service ethic is something we take for granted in the United\n> States. . .at least you can count on the public officials to process your\n> application in a reasonable time without requiring a large bribe. In many\n> other countries, the conduct of state employees ranges from routine petty\n> corruption to organized extortion.\n>\n> ...Should we be surprised that the so-called \u201cWashington Consensus\u201d or\n> \u201cneoliberal\u201d recommendations...have not brought rapid prosperity to\n> countries that lack some of the necessary ethics?\n\nAt a time when nearly every household connection to the Internet was through\ncopper telephone wires, I wrote,\n\n> The communication network will have a fiber skeleton and a wireless skin.\n> Telephone landlines will be superfluous.\n\nI argued that surveillance technology makes laws too enforceable.\n\n> many laws are the legal equivalent of oxymorons\u2014legamorons, if you will. A\n> legamoron is any law which could not stand up under widespread enforcement.\n> Laws against marijuana use are a prime example. {others are]\n>\n>   * immigration laws\n>\n>   * laws against sexual harassment\n>\n>   * laws against betting on sports\n>\n>   * speed limits\n>\n>   * software licenses\n>\n>   * laws against music sharing\n>\n>   * laws requiring people to pay social security taxes for household workers\n>\n>\n\n>\n> ...Surely, it would be better to abolish the legamorons and instead write\n> laws that we could enforce to society\u2019s benefit rather than its detriment.\n\nI suggested that the term \u201cintellectual property\u201d is misleading, and that the\nphenomena it describes should be split into various categories. I argued that\na business process does not deserve a patent, but a new pharmaceutical does.\nBut on pharmaceuticals, I wrote,\n\n> There are foundations that are dedicated to dealing with particular\n> diseases. . .These foundations could offer prizes for the development of\n> pharmaceuticals...\n\nI predicted that for content creators the Internet would reconfigure the role\nof distributors rather than eliminate them.\n\n> Fundamentally, there is a lot of supply in the market for pop music. . .the\n> average wage rate is never going to get very high...\n>\n> Unless the Internet reduces network effects\u2014and I can think of no reason it\n> should\u2014the random component of success will continue to be large.\n\nDid you see my comment on Robin Hanson\u2019s recent post? My book from 20 years\nago included,\n\n> The theme of the seminar was the difference...between humanists...and\n> scientists. It was Wilkinson who provided what for me is a useful way to\n> describe this difference. He said that a humanist arrives at understanding\n> subjectively, through introspection and empathy. A scientists arrives at\n> understanding objectively, through the scientific method.\n\nThat chapter, called \u201cMoore vs. Plato,\u201d will give you a sense of my anti-\nclassicist bent.\n\nThe book reproduces an essay I wrote in July of 1999, \u201cInternet in a Bubble,\u201d\nwhich in hindsight seems prescient about the Dotcom crash.\n\nMy favorite Internet IPO went off this week.\n\n> ...musicmaker had $75,000 in revenue...They took in enough in sales to pay a\n> secretary with benefits, and now they have gone public. Successfully.\n\nBut I am not a perma-bear. The book also reproduces an essay from 2002, called\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Your Margin of Safety?\u201d\n\n> The way I read the data, the chance that the market will permanently adopt a\n> margin of safety of 73 percent or higher is close to nil. . .At some point,\n> the market\u2019s margin of safety will recover to lower levels, and that would\n> meant that investors who buy today will enjoy superior returns.\n\nThe last chapters in the book are on policy issues related to the welfare\nstate. I will save discussion of those for the next post in this series.\n\nShare\n\n15 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n15\n\nShare this post\n\n#### My Books, Essay #3\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nThe Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\nWhy don't more women use it?\n\nSep 24, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n50\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n111\n\nI Condemn. . .But\n\nThe worst form of evil\n\nOct 14, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n99\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I Condemn. . .But\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n80\n\nAssimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\nWe have not done it well\n\nMay 10, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n64\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Assimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n61\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Arnold Kling\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
