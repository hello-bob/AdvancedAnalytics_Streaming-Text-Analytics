Born in California, Ver\nrenounced his US citizenship in February 2014 to become a citizen of St. Kitts\nand Nevis, a dual-island nation located between the Atlantic Ocean and the\nCaribbean Sea.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Ver failed to report the 131,000 Bitcoins he\nowned in 2014 when he renounced his citizenship. Using this method, Ver is\nalleged to have avoided taxes, underrepresented his Bitcoin holdings, and\nevaded taxes. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,000, which means\nVer\u2019s 131,000 Bitcoins are worth about $7.5 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVer\u2019s indictment comes a day after cryptocurrency exchange Binance founder\nChangpeng Zhao who pleaded guilty last year to money laundering, received a\nfour-month jail sentence. Previously, Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the FTX\ncrypto exchange, was sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Quartz.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
