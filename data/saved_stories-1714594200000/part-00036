The hospital called his wife three times to tell her that her\nhusband was going to die.\n\nAstraZeneca is contesting the claims but has accepted, in a legal document\nsubmitted to the High Court in February, that its Covid vaccine \u201ccan, in very\nrare cases, cause TTS\u201d.\n\n### Stay informed, stay ahead\n\nSign up to our newsletters and always be quiz ready, with the best of the\nTelegraph - and exclusives - delivered straight to your inbox\n\nDaily Digest Newsletter\n\nDaily Digest Newsletter\n\nA curated selection of articles, exclusively for readers in America\n\nBy creating a Telegraph account, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and our\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nTTS \u2013 which stands for Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome \u2013 causes\npeople to have blood clots and a low blood platelet count.\n\nFifty-one cases have been lodged in the High Court, with victims and grieving\nrelatives seeking damages estimated to be worth up to \u00a3100 million.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s admission \u2013 made in a legal defence to Mr Scott\u2019s High Court\nclaim \u2013 follows intense legal wrangling. It could lead to payouts if the drug\nfirm accepts that the vaccine was the cause of serious illness and death in\nspecific legal cases. The Government has pledged to underwrite AstraZeneca\u2019s\nlegal bills.\n\nA 2021 view inside Oxford Biomedica, where the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine was\nproduced Credit: John Lawrence\n\nIn a letter of response sent in May 2023, AstraZeneca told lawyers for Mr\nScott that \u201cwe do not accept that TTS is caused by the vaccine at a generic\nlevel\u201d.\n\nBut in the legal document submitted to the High Court in February, AstraZeneca\nsaid: \u201cIt is admitted that the AZ vaccine can, in very rare cases, cause TTS.\nThe causal mechanism is not known.\n\n\u201cFurther, TTS can also occur in the absence of the AZ vaccine (or any\nvaccine). Causation in any individual case will be a matter for expert\nevidence.\u201d\n\nLawyers argue that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is \u201cdefective\u201d and that its\nefficacy has been \u201cvastly overstated\u201d \u2013 claims AstraZeneca strongly denies.\n\nScientists first identified a link between the vaccine and a new illness\ncalled vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) as early\nas March 2021, shortly after the Covid-19 vaccine rollout began.\n\nLawyers for the claimants argue that VITT is a subset of TTS, although\nAstraZeneca does not appear to recognise the term.\n\nThe Government has indemnified AstraZeneca against any legal action but has so\nfar refused to intervene.\n\nKate Scott, Mr Scott\u2019s wife, told the Telegraph: \u201cThe medical world has\nacknowledged for a long time that VITT was caused by the vaccine. It\u2019s only\nAstraZeneca who have questioned whether Jamie\u2019s condition was caused by the\njab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken three years for this admission to come. It\u2019s progress, but we\nwould like to see more from them and the Government. It\u2019s time for things to\nmove more quickly.\n\n\u201cI hope their admission means we will be able to sort this out sooner rather\nthan later. We need an apology, fair compensation for our family and other\nfamilies who have been affected. We have the truth on our side, and we are not\ngoing to give up.\u201d\n\n## \u2018Patient safety is our highest priority\u2019\n\nSarah Moore, a partner at law firm Leigh Day, who is bringing the legal\nclaims, said: \u201cIt has taken AstraZeneca a year to formally admit that their\nvaccine can cause the devastating blood clots, when this fact has been widely\naccepted by the clinical community since the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cIn that context, regrettably it seems that AZ, the Government and their\nlawyers are more keen to play strategic games and run up legal fees than to\nengage seriously with the devastating impact that their AZ vaccine has had\nupon our clients\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nIn a statement AstraZeneca said: \u201cOur sympathy goes out to anyone who has lost\nloved ones or reported health problems. Patient safety is our highest\npriority, and regulatory authorities have clear and stringent standards to\nensure the safe use of all medicines, including vaccines.\n\n\u201cFrom the body of evidence in clinical trials and real-world data, the\nAstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has continuously been shown to have an acceptable\nsafety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the\nbenefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side\neffects.\u201d\n\nThe company is pointing out that product information relating to the vaccine\nwas updated in April 2021, with the approval of the UK regulator, to include\n\u201cthe possibility that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is capable, in very rare\ncases, of being a trigger for\u201d TTS.\n\nThe company does not recognise claims it has performed an about-turn in\nacknowledging that the vaccine can cause TTS in court documents.\n\nIndependent studies show the AstraZeneca vaccine was incredibly effective in\ntackling the pandemic, saving more than six million lives globally in the\nfirst year of the rollout.\n\nThe World Health Organisation has said the vaccine was \u201csafe and effective for\nall individuals aged 18 and above\u201d and the adverse effect that has prompted\nthe legal action was \u201cvery rare\u201d.\n\nBoris Johnson praised the vaccine as a 'triumph for British science' Credit:\nPAUL ELLIS/AFP\n\nThe vaccine \u2013 heralded at its launch by Boris Johnson as a \u201ctriumph for\nBritish science\u201d \u2013 is no longer used in the UK.\n\nIn the months after the rollout, the potentially serious side effect of the\njab was identified by scientists. It was then recommended that under-40s be\noffered an alternative jab because the risk of the AstraZeneca vaccine\noutweighed the harm posed by Covid.\n\nLawyers representing families suing the drugs company argue that the vaccine\nwas not as safe as individuals were entitled to expect. They are suing the\nfirm, based in Cambridge, under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.\n\nMr Scott\u2019s lawyers have argued that he suffered \u201cpersonal injuries and\nconsequential losses arising out of his sustaining vaccine induced immune\nthrombosis with thrombocytopenia (VITT) as a result of his vaccination on 23\nApril 2021, with the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccination\u201d.\n\n### Stay informed, stay ahead\n\nSign up to our newsletters and always be quiz ready, with the best of the\nTelegraph - and exclusives - delivered straight to your inbox\n\nDaily Digest Newsletter\n\nDaily Digest Newsletter\n\nA curated selection of articles, exclusively for readers in America\n\nBy creating a Telegraph account, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and our\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nOfficial figures from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\n(MHRA) show at least 81 deaths in the UK are suspected to have been linked to\nthe adverse reaction that caused clotting in people who also had low blood\nplatelets.\n\nIn total, almost one in five people who suffered from the condition died as a\nresult, according to the MHRA\u2019s figures.\n\nThe Government runs its own vaccine compensation scheme but alleged victims\nclaim the one-off payment of \u00a3120,000 is inadequate.\n\nFigures obtained under a Freedom of Information request show that out of 163\npayouts made by the Government by February this year, at least 158 went to\nrecipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nThe Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme gives compensation to those injured by\nvaccines or to bereaved next of kin. Fewer than five people under the scheme\nreceived vaccines other than AstraZeneca.\n\nAstraZeneca has previously argued in court papers that claims against the\ncompany are \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cwrong in law\u201d. In the defence filing, AstraZeneca\nsaid the benefit/risk profile of the vaccine was, and remains, positive.\n\nAstraZeneca is the second largest publicly listed company in the UK, with a\nmarket capitalisation of more than \u00a3170 billion. Its chief executive, Sir\nPascal Soriot, is the highest-paid boss among FTSE 100 companies, with\nearnings close to \u00a319 million.\n\n### Stay informed, stay ahead\n\nSign up to our newsletters and always be quiz ready, with the best of the\nTelegraph - and exclusives - delivered straight to your inbox\n\nDaily Digest Newsletter\n\nDaily Digest Newsletter\n\nA curated selection of articles, exclusively for readers in America\n\nBy creating a Telegraph account, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and our\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * AstraZeneca,\n  * Vaccines,\n  * Coronavirus,\n  * Booster vaccines,\n  * Death\n\n3050\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
