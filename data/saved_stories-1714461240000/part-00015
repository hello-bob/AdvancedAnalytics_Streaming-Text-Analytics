As\nyou\u2019d guess it often comes across both weird and unnecessary. \u201cDes, this\ndoesn\u2019t sound like the type of value-add advice we need, I mean who in their\nright mind has an idea, builds a team, raises a few million of venture\ncapital, and then... forgets to launch?\u201d\n\nAnd yet I keep saying it, and still so many keep forgetting.\n\nWhen I say launch, I mean the real deal. No apologies, no private lists, no\nfriends & family launches, no DM our founder and see if you can get an access\ncode, I mean \u201cput it all out there, and watch what happens, learn, and be\nready to react\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve watched about a dozen companies with great ideas, with plenty of funding,\nwith strong teams, forget to launch. Forget is probably an unfair word here.\nWhat actually happens is that there\u2019s a long list of priorities and the big\nscary launch where you find out if the whole thing is worthwhile falls below\nthe easy next task that doesn\u2019t bite back. Do that enough and you have a big\nproduct, a good demo, some well-polished narrative, but no actual evidence\nthat any of this will work. And the clock keeps ticking down.\n\nIn Intercom, we say Shipping is an act of confidence and humility. You need\nenough self-confidence and belief to put yourself out there, and then you need\nto be humble enough to accept you probably got lots of bits wrong along the\nway. Your product is a conversation with the market and launching is just the\nopening dialogue.\n\nThe real risks of indefinitely postponing launch are:\n\n  1. Your ideas hit the market before your product does. Other companies learn from what you share in your blog posts, or your teaser screenshots. I\u2019ve seen companies ship great ideas that they found percolating in the private betas of the less confident startups still waiting for perfection.\n\n  2. You inspire the market, but that inspiration is perishable. Buzz has a shelf life, you can get everyone excited and ready to rock on your new project management app, calendar, to-do, but if they can\u2019t use it for a few more months they move on.\n\n  3. It gets harder the longer you wait. There\u2019s some type of vicious cycle here, where your fears & expectations and ultimately your launch keeps growing which weirdly means the launch date seems to get further away the more you work. The next feature fallacy is real.\n\n  4. The chances of success are lower. Unless you know your area and your customers inside out, you will make some mistakes in the form of unnecessary or misguided features. The longer you wait, the more you\u2019ll have. The more you have, the slower you\u2019ll move. The slower you move the quicker you die.\n\n  5. Runway & Energy are too low for launch. This one should be obvious, but again...launch is the starting line, not the finish line. If you intend to forge your way to product-market fit you should assume you\u2019ll need to release 2-3 more significant versions of your product, you and your team will need the energy to do customer support, the customer research calls, the long days the late nights fixing critical issues and launching \u201cmust-haves\u201d. Doing all this on an empty tank will kill you. And similarly launching with 2-3 months of runway left puts you in a very very difficult position.\n\nI understand the safety net of not launching, you can maintain your perceived\nstatus as a founder, your product can continue to evolve aspirationally until\nit becomes the \u201csuperset of all great feature ideas ever\u201d, and most\nimportantly you can continue to use the future to defend yourself from the\npresent. You keep telling yourself, your investors, and your employees about\nhow great things are going to be once you launch.\n\nAnd yes, the fear is real, it is understandable. It\u2019s okay to be terrified\nabout putting the biggest work of your career out to the world to be\ncriticized, questioned, and sadly, yes, dunk-tweeted by losers who\u2019s only way\nto prop themselves up is to shit-post about other companies.\n\nBut just know that there are worse things in life than your ideas getting\npicked apart and criticized. You could, for example, piss away years of your\nlife avoiding reality and refusing to launch. It is truly better to regret\nsomething you did than something you couldn\u2019t do.\n\nSo that\u2019s seven hundred words to say just four: don\u2019t forget to launch.\n\nBack to all essays\n\nFind me on Twitter LinkedIn Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
