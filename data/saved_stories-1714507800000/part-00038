That\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to\nlook into for a while but I was busy with reviews and other obligations\n(Hello, Mr. Taxman!), and this weekend I had some spare time to carry on the\ncomparison.\n\n## Raspberry Pi 5 vs Intel N100 mini PC specifications\n\nI\u2019ll start by comparing the specifications of a Raspberry Pi 5 against the\nones for typical Intel Processor N100-based mini PCs also mentioning optional\nfeatures that come at extra cost.\n\nRaspberry Pi 5| Intel N100 Mini PC  \n---|---  \n  \nRaspberry Pi 5| Intel N100 Mini PC  \n---|---  \nSoC| Broadcom BCM2712| Intel Processor N100  \n\\- CPU| Quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 processor @ 2.4 GHz| Quad-core \"Alder Lake-N\"\nprocessor @ 3.4 GHz (Turbo)  \n\\- GPU| VideoCore VII GPU @ 800 MHz with support for OpenGL ES 3.1, Vulkan\n1.2| 24EU Intel HD graphics @ 750 MHz with support for DirectX 12.1, OpenGL\n4.6, OpenCL 3.0  \n\\- Video Decode on GPU| 4Kp60 HEVC decoder| 4Kp60 AVC (H.264), HEVC (H.265),\nVP9, JPEG, AV1  \n\\- Video Encoder on GPU| N/A| 4Kp30 AVC, HEVC (H.265), VP9, JPEG  \nSystem Memory| 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4X-4267| 8GB to 32GB DDR4/DDR5/LPDDR5  \nStorage| MicroSD card M.2 NVMe or SATA via HAT board 2.5-inch/3.5-inch SATA\ndrive via HAT board| MicroSD or SD card slot Included M.2 NVMe or SATA drive\n2.5-inch SATA drive slot on some systems  \nVideo Outputs / Display Interfaces| 2x micro HDMI ports up to 4Kp60 2x 4-lane\nMIPI DSI display connectors| Up to 3 displays supported via HDMI, DisplayPort,\nand/or USB-C up to 4Kp60  \nAudio| Digital audio via HDMI Various HATs for additional audio ports| Digital\naudio via HDMI 3.5mm audio jack (on most systems)  \nCamera| 2x 4-lane MIPI CSI camera connectors (multiplexed with MIPi DSI)|\nUsually only through USB cameras  \nEthernet| Gigabit Ethernet| Gigabit Ethernet, 2.5GbE, or multiple Ethernet\ninterfaces depending on system  \nWireless| WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0| WiFi 5/6/6E and Bluetooth 4.2 to 5.4\ndepending on M.2 wireless module selected  \nUSB| 2x USB 3.0 ports (5Gbps) 2x USB 2.0 ports| Depends on system, up to 5x\nUSB ports, with 10 Gbps USB 3.2, USB 2.0, and USB-C with DisplayPort Alt mode\nports supported  \nGPIO| 40-pin Raspberry Pi GPIO header| Usually none, only available through\nUSB to GPIO adapters  \nPCIe| Custom connector for PCIe Gen 2 x1 (official), or PCIe Gen3 x1\n(unofficial, and may not work on all boards)| Standard M.2 socket with PCIe\nGen3 x4  \nPower Supply| 5V/5A| Varies, often 12V (30W)  \nIdle Power Consumption| 3.0 to 3.6 Watts| 7.5 to 10 Watts (Typ.)  \nDimensions| 85 x 56 mm| As small as 87.8 x 87.8 x 37 mm (Blackview MP80)  \nSupported OS| Official Raspberry Pi OS support Certified Ubuntu 22.04/24.04\nsupport Several other OSes with various degree of supports| Usually ships with\nWindows 11 Pro All x86 operating systems are supported (Linux, FreeBSD, ..)\nalbeit full support depends on available drivers (e.g. for WiFi/Bluetooth)  \n  \nSome remarks:\n\n  1. Intel N100 systems with DDR4/DDR5 usually rely on one (replaceable/upgradeable) SO-DIMM module while LPDDR5 is soldered on the main board. Raspberry Pi 5 always comes with soldered-on memory.\n  2. Not all USB-C ports found in Alder Lake-N mini PCs support Displayport Alt mode, it depends on the model.\n  3. Some Intel N100 SBCs such as the AAEON UP 7000 provide a GPIO header, but I wanted to focus on the features in typical mini PCs in this post. It\u2019s also possible to add GPIO headers through a USB adapter\n  4. The Blackview MP80 mini PC is not powered by an Intel Processor N100, but by the similar Intel N95 or N97 Alder lake-N processor, and was used to show it\u2019s possible to get a really small x86 mini PC. Most are larger than that, and the Raspberry Pi 5 should be a better option for space-constrained applications.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nThe Raspberry Pi 5 was tested with Raspberry Pi OS Desktop 64-bit, and I\nselected the benchmark results for the GEEKOM Mini Air12 mini PC on Ubuntu\n22.04. I haven\u2019t run Geekbench 6 on my Raspberry Pi 5, so I took one of the\nresults from the Geekbench 6 database for a Raspberry Pi 5 at stock (2.4 GHz)\nfrequency. The storage read speed for the Raspberry Pi 5 was measured with a\n128GB MAKERDISK NVMe SSD and the PCIe interface configured as PCIe Gen3 x1.\n\nRaspberry Pi 5| GEEKOM Mini Air12  \n---|---  \n  \nRaspberry Pi 5| GEEKOM Mini Air12  \n---|---  \nSBC-Bench.sh  \n\\- memcpy| 5158.3 MB/s| 10459.3 MB/s  \n\\- memset| 11671.4 MB/s| 10665.4 MB/s  \n\\- 7-zip (average)| 10930 MIPS| 13940 MIPS  \n\\- 7-zip (top result)| 10980 MIPS| 13976 MIPS  \n\\- OpenSSL AES-256 16K| 1,367,736.32k| 1,233,283.75k  \nGeekbench 6 Single| 789| 1,213  \nGeekbench 6 Multi| 1,523| 3,272  \nSpeedometer (Firefox)| 56.6 runs/minute| 149 runs/minutes  \nSpeedometer (Chrome)| 63.5 runs/minute| N/A  \nMax storage read speed (NVMe SSD)| 855MB/s| 3.2GB/s  \n  \nThe Raspberry Pi 5 can be overclocked to get more performance, and some people\nmanaged to achieve 1,033 points (single-core) and 2146 points (multi-core) at\n3.10 GHz, but it is still lower than on Intel Processor N100 mini PC, and may\nnot work on all Raspberry Pi 5 boards.\n\nThe Intel N100-powered GEEKOM Mini Air12 is faster for most tasks, and in some\ncases up to almost three times as fast (Speedometer 2.0 in Firefox), except\nfor memset (similar results) and OpenSSL AES-256 where the higher sustained\nsingle-core CPU frequency helps the Arm SBC.\n\n## Raspberry Pi 5 vs Intel N100 mini PC price comparison\n\nThis one will be tough as everybody has different requirements, local or\nimport taxes, and so on. But I\u2019ll first calculate the price of a minimum\nworking system and the Raspberry Pi 5 equivalent of the MINIX Z100-0dB mini PC\nwith 8GB RAM, a 256GB NVMe SSD, 2.5GbE, WiFi 6, and a fanless enclosure.\n\nFor the minimum working configuration, we\u2019ll assume the user wants a Linux or\nWindows system that boots to the OS, and connects to the network and a display\nwithout any other specific requirements. The Raspberry Pi 5 4GB is good enough\nfor this along with the active cooler, a 5V/5A power adapter (although 5V/3A\nmight do too), and a microSD card. I also searched for the cheapest N100 mini\nPC I could find with storage and memory: the CHUWI Larkbox X (12GB RAM, 512GB\nSATA SSD) sold for $125.93 with free shipping on Aliexpress at the time of\nwriting.\n\nRaspberry Pi 5 4GB| CHUWI Larkbox X  \n---|---  \n  \nRaspberry Pi 5 4GB| CHUWI Larkbox X  \n---|---  \nSystem price| $60| $126  \nActive cooler| $5| Included  \nPower adapter| $12| Included  \nStorage| $10 (32GB Class A1 microSD)| Included  \nHDMI cable| $6 (2 meter micro HDMI cable)| Included  \nTotal| $93| $126  \n  \nI tried to select low-cost items for the Raspberry Pi 5 and considered adding\nan enclosure unnecessary for the minimum configuration (it would add $5 to\n$20). Taxes and handling fees are not considered for either device, and the\nshipping fee is not included for the Raspberry Pi 5 kit which ends up being\nabout $33 cheaper. The Larkbox X mini PC delivers higher performance and\noffers more memory, dual Gigabit Ethernet, and WiFi 6. The Raspberry Pi 5\nremains the ideal candidate for use cases requiring GPIO, low power\nconsumption, and a small size.\n\nNow let\u2019s switch to another user who will wonder \u201cWhat year is this?!\u201d when\nhearing or reading the words \u201cgigabit Ethernet\u201d, \u201cWiFi 5\u201d, \u201c4GB RAM\u201d, and/or\n\u201cmicroSD card\u201d. He won\u2019t allow any noisy fan to pollute his room either, and\nhe\u2019d been fine with a fanless mini PC like the MINIX Z100-0dB with 8GB RAM\nthat\u2019s currently sold for $220.71 on Amazon excluding taxes with an 8%\ndiscount coupon selectable before order.\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens if we try to reproduce this setup with a Raspberry Pi 5\n8GB. We\u2019ll still need the 5V/5A power adapter and a micro HDMI cable, but\nwe\u2019ll replace the active cooler with a fanless metal case that can still take\nHAT expansion boards and the microSD card with an NVMe SSD with an M.2 PCIe\nHat. We\u2019ll need a WiFi 6 USB 3.0 dongle and a 2.5GbE USB 3.0 dongle, although\nHAT expansion boards could be daisy-chained to achieve the same result, but\nthat would start to get messy and be more expensive.\n\nRaspberry Pi 5 8GB| MINIX Z100-0dB  \n---|---  \n  \nRaspberry Pi 5 8GB| MINIX Z100-0dB  \n---|---  \nSystem price| $80| $221  \nFanless case| $18 (EDATEC)| Included  \nPower adapter| $12| Included  \nStorage| $26 (256GB M.2 NVMe SSD| Included  \nM.2 PCIe HAT| $15 (GEEKWORM X1001)| N/A  \nHDMI cable| $6 (2 meter micro HDMI cable)| Included  \nWiFi 6| Around $24 on Amazon| Included  \n2.5GbE| About $20 on Amazon| Included  \nTotal| $201| $221  \n  \nThe Raspberry Pi 5 system is still cheaper (by $20) before taking into account\nthe shipping fees which may add up when purchasing from multiple vendors. The\nEDATEC fanless case is also hard to get as it\u2019s not for sale on Aliexpress\nanymore, and finding another complete Raspberry Pi 5 case that takes a HAT+\nexpansion board is challenging. We\u2019ve also created a monster with a HAT and\nall four USB ports would be used in a typical system with a USB keyboard, a\nUSB mouse, and our two USB 3.0 dongles for WiFi 6 and 2.5GbE. In that specific\nuse case, I\u2019d consider the Raspberry Pi 5 to be undesirable, and people would\nbe better served by a mini PC. I reckon I\u2019ve pushed the requirements a bit far\nwith WiFi 6 and 2.5GbE, as I\u2019d expect many people would be fine the the built-\nin gigabit Ethernet and WiFi 5 connectivity, in which case the Pi 5 could\nstill be considered.\n\n## Final words\n\nAs one would expect, there\u2019s no simple answer to the question \u201cWhich is the\nbest? A Raspberry Pi 5 SBC or an Intel N100 mini PC?\u201d since it will depend on\nthe user\u2019s specific requirements. The Raspberry Pi SBC was first introduced as\ncheap hardware for the education market, and I would recommend the Raspberry\nPi 4 over the Raspberry Pi 5 for this purpose since it\u2019s cheaper and does the\njob. The Raspberry Pi 5 is more suitable for projects that require extra\nperformance while keeping the small form factor, GPIO header, and camera\nconnectors. Intel Processor N100 mini PCs offer a better performance/price\nratio as a general-purpose computer running Windows 11 or a Linux distribution\nsuch as Ubuntu, although you may potentially save a few dollars by using a\nRaspberry Pi 5.\n\nJean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)\n\nJean-Luc started CNX Software in 2010 as a part-time endeavor, before quitting\nhis job as a software engineering manager, and starting to write daily news,\nand reviews full time later in 2011.\n\nShare this:\n\nFacebookTwitterHacker\nNewsSlashdotRedditLinkedInPinterestFlipboardMeWeLineEmailShare\n\nSupport CNX Software!

Interestingly, I achieved this low\npower consumption only in windows, in linux it was around 1.8-2.0W, although\nthe package was still reaching C10 state.\n\nReply\n\nAuthor\n\nJean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)\n\n22 hours ago\n\nDougQuaid\n\nI should probably do a follow-up post about this.

Some might take ages to wake up or just stay in power saving mode\nand not wake up when you need them. It seems that the i226 on the Odroid-H4 is\nsuffering from this for example, and I have it entirely turned off on my PC\nbecause I don\u2019t remember what was randomly failing, I think it was the\nintegrated GPU but I could be wrong, it\u2019s been so long being happy without.\nBut some machines work remarkably well with ASPM and in this case it...

However the idle\nconsumption requires an instant reading (or averaged over a period) since\nthat\u2019s what most SBCs will experience.\n\nReply\n\nAnonymous\n\n1 day ago\n\nThe N100 should technically support up to 48 GB now, as seen with the N97 in\nthe ODROID-H4(+). Maybe that will even rise to 64 GB when the new 64 GB\nmodules are released within the next year, as motherboards are already being\nupdated to support them. There\u2019s no fix for it being in single-channel though.\n\nReply\n\nBib\n\n1 day ago\n\nI would like to see comparison with n97 as well.\n\nReply\n\nAuthor\n\nJean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)\n\n1 day ago\n\nBib\n\nIt\u2019s going to be about the same when compared to the Raspberry Pi 5.
