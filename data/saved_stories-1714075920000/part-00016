Perhaps there is Norwegian\nexceptionalism at work, but the results reflect my expectations reasonably\nclosely. The basic setting is that smart phones were banned in middle school,\nbut at varying (and exogenous) rates around the country. Here are some of the\ncore findings, noting that reading the paper gives some different impressions\nfrom some of the Twitter summaries:\n\n1\\. Grades improve, for instance for the girls it goes up by 0.08 standard\ndeviations. Worth doing, but hardly saving a generation. For girls, the\nbiggest improvement comes in their math scores.\n\n2\\. The girls consult less with mental health-related professionals, with\nvisits falling by 0.22 on average to their GPs, falling by 2-3 visits to\nspecialist care.\n\n3\\. \u201cI find no effect on students\u2019 likelihood (extensive margin) of being\ndiagnosed or treated by specialists or GPs for a psychological symptom and\ndiseases.\u201d So more visits, but those visits don\u2019t lead to much.\n\n4\\. Bullying falls, by 0.42 of an SD for girls, 0.39 of an SD for boys. That\nis a larger effect than I would have expected.\n\n5\\. The grade gains are highest for students with lower SES backgrounds.\n\n6\\. When you look into the details of the data (p.22), the improvement in\ngrades does not seem correlated with the decline in the number of visits to\nmental health professionals.\n\nSo if you ban smart phones from schools, grades go up by a very modest amount,\nbullying falls by a less modest amount, and actual mental health diagnoses\nstay the same. In the United States at least, parents seem to hate cellphone\nbans, because they cannot reach their kids at will.\n\nAnd there you go. Here is some commentary on the p values in the paper.\n\n  * 44 Comments\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS Feed\n\n  * print\n\n## Comments\n\n### yo\n\n2024-04-25 04:53:24\n\n66| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nSo now you're against *marginal* improvements?\n\nRespond\n\n### MrSquiggles\n\n2024-04-25 03:07:55\n\n46| 2  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nI am sure it's a great paper but that conversation with Jon Haidt is still an\nembarrassing low point.\n\nRespond\n\n### anton maier\n\n2024-04-25 03:22:35\n\n1| 1  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nWhy?\n\nRespond\n\n### Diogenes's Barrel\n\n2024-04-25 05:23:16\n\n55| 2  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nBecause it is fundamentally weird that TC is never, ever even 1/10th as\nconfrontational about any other topic.

Isn't kids having\nsmart phones at all times an extension of the \"helicopter parent\" phenomenon?\nIs that a good thing? On the other hand, isn't kids having smart phones at all\ntimes an alternative to actually supervising your kids? A smart phone does not\nsupervise kids, it only offers an illusion of supervision. Who is benefited by\nthis arrangement: the kids or the parents? I'm not against smart phones, but\nadults need to consider the merits of the cultural phenomenon of being armed\nwith a fully loaded smart phone at all times.\n\nI read an essay this morning by the talented Zeynep Tufekci in which she is\nquestioning the adequacy of the government's response to the outbreak of H5N1\navian influenza among U.S. dairy cows. It's a long and thorough critical look\nat the response so far, but one relates to the reliance on the smart phones of\nfarmworkers where the herd has tested positive by sending the farmworkers\nperiodic text messages reminding them to report any symptoms they may develop.\nFrom the essay: \"it\u2019s too much to expect that a poor farmworker \u2014 afraid of\nstigma, legal troubles and economic loss \u2014 will always report even mild\nsymptoms and stay home from work as instructed\". It's equivalent to sending\nperiodic text messages to teenagers reminding them not to do something stupid.\nSure, that will work.\n\nRespond\n\n### bilbo b.\n\n2024-04-25 09:22:23\n\n1| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nIt's the deranged lunacy of parents thinking school shootings are a common\noccurrence rather than vanishingly rare.

A bit over a decade ago school districts we lived in in\nboth CA and NY tried to ban phones and parents completely revolted. I wonder\nhow much is a time thing, that people are more aware now of the downsides, and\nhow much is it becoming a \"red vs blue\" issue and FL is obviously radically\ndifferent from CA or NY (though we were in a \"blue\" city in CA and a \"red\"\nsmall town in NY...)\n\nRespond\n\n### blue jay\n\n2024-04-25 09:44:56\n\n0| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nIMO the attacks on social media as \"addictive\" are ridiculous, but my view is\nthat kids shouldn't have the damned phones in the first place, not because\nthey're addictive or not but because the internet is overwhelmingly adult\ncontent that sixth-graders don't need access to.\n\nRespond\n\n### Dave\n\n2024-04-25 02:48:10\n\n24| 1  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nPerhaps social media is just bad for us.\n\nRespond\n\n### Hazel Meade\n\n2024-04-25 09:48:20\n\n0| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nHere' the caveat I would add. Social meda in it's current form is bad for us.\n\nThat's because the current form of social media is designed to addict people\nby playing upon status anxiety. That's intentional. The original marketing\nstrategy of Facebook was to start it in Ivy League schools so that it would be\n\"exclusive\". The entire thing about allowing people to like and see other\npeople's friend counts and likes, is designed to make people compete for likes\nand friends.\n\nBut it's possible to envision a form a social media that isn't so entirely\nbased on status competition. And maybe that wouldn't be as bad for people.\n\nRespond\n\n### TJB\n\n2024-04-25 04:31:26\n\n18| 1  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nWhy don't they simply skim summaries prepared by impartial, altruistic AI bots\nwho have the kids' best interests in mind?

They use Google Docs for chat if they're not allowed their\nphones.

The number of visits to\nmental health professionals declined. I haven't done any kind of power\nanalysis, but I'd wonder if the paper is appropriately powered to find\nmeaningful changes in mental health diagnoses. Here's what the paper finds: -\nreduced bullying (consistent with other work on phone bans) -reduced visits\n(by almost 60% relative to pre-treatment) to specialists for psychological\nsymptoms and diseases - increased grades (most likely concentrated in the\nweakest students) - effects are strongest in girls (consistent with most other\nresearch in this area) - here's the kicker: \"the effect on grades, GPA, and\ntest scores is largest among girls attending middle schools that ban students\nfrom bringing their phones to school or schools where students must hand their\nphones in before classes start.\" So those schools with tougher restrictions\nsee more gains. What Tyler isn't highlighting is that there is some variation\non how tough restrictions were and the results are for all schools. This gives\nsome indication that the overall results presented are lower bound benefits.\n\nAlso note, the ability to detect an impact on an outcome depends on how many\nsteps the causal chain is. I'd take decreased bullying and decreased visit to\nmental health specialist as a good sign that the phone ban has at least some\npositive impact on student mental health. But maybe this is just the first\nstep in Tyler's transformation.\n\nRespond\n\n### Hazel Meade\n\n2024-04-25 09:40:56\n\n0| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nTo say that bullying declined but mental health didn't improve is to suggest\nthat bullying doesn't affect mental health. Do me that sounds pretty absurd.\nNot epistemically impossible, buy really, we dislike bullying because (duh) it\nmakes kids depressed and upset. Which is a mental health effect. So my guess\nhere is that there are enough hints of better mental health outcomes to say,\nyeah, mental health did improve, it's just somewhat harder to see directly in\nthe data. But if you tie it all together - less bullying, fewer visits to\nspecialists, better grades, I think you can probably say that mental health\nalso went up. And the fact that kids from lower SES backgrounds fits .... who\ngets bullied? In my experience, it's generally the rich kids that bully the\npoor kids, contrary to perhaps some people's perceptions.\n\nRespond\n\n### jason y\n\n2024-04-25 08:39:54\n\n4| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nI don't believe that's why parents are against cell phone bans.\n\nFrom my lately quite extensive experience with parents, those most likely to\npush back on cell phone limitations are those who do not enforce cell phone\nlimits at home. They take any suggestion that phone usage should be limited as\na personal attack.\n\nThis is extremely common. You'll say, nah, I doubt it, the desire for a parent\nto know their child is safe is the driving force here, no way ego preservation\npredominates, but you, I think, are wrong.\n\nRespond\n\n### sam\n\n2024-04-25 03:17:01\n\n8| 6  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\n0.8 sd effect on grades is huge\n\nRespond\n\n### M\n\n2024-04-25 03:51:38\n\n6| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nThe effect size above is 0.08 though.\n\nRespond\n\n### murmur\n\n2024-04-25 04:40:58\n\n3| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\n0.08, not 0.8.\n\nRespond\n\n### Eteban5685\n\n2024-04-25 08:32:53\n\n2| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nFrom the source. \u201c83% of parents support a minimum age limit on when kids\nshould be allowed to have their own social media accounts.\u201d\n\nRespond\n\n### blue jay\n\n2024-04-25 09:24:17\n\n2| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\n\"...by 0.08 standard deviations.
