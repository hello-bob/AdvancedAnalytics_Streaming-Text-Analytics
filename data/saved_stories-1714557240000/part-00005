Everything you need to know\n\nThe Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is the bedrock of modern Android skins\nlike One UI and MIUI.\n\nBy\n\n\u2022\n\nPublished onFebruary 28, 2024\n\nDamien Wilde / Android Authority\n\nOne of Android\u2019s greatest strengths, and source of occasional frustrations, is\nits wide variety of software variations. Samsung\u2019s One UI and even Google\u2019s\nPixel UI offer their own spin on the core Android experience, introducing\ntheir own unique features and ideas to improve on the basic software below.\nThis is all made possible thanks to a common base operating system (OS) that\nprovides the core functionality. That\u2019s right, all of the Android OS variants\nthat you know and love are based on AOSP, or the Android Open Source Project.\n\nPut simply, AOSP is an open-source operating system development project\nmaintained by Google. Since it\u2019s open-source, anyone is free to review and\ncontribute code and fixes to the project repository. However, Google oversees\nits general direction and has the final say in the bulk of its development.\n\nThe AOSP receives regular bug fixes, which get packaged and delivered to\nAndroid smartphones in the form of monthly security patches. Google also\nunveils major new features each year at its I/O developer conference, with\nyearly releases like Android 14.\n\nIn addition to being open to contributions, the Android Open Source Project is\nfree to use and alter under an open-source license. Manufacturers like Amazon\nand Samsung are free to tweak the project for their own purposes and have\ndeveloped their own spin-offs, including the multi-purpose Fire OS that\ndoesn\u2019t ship with Google services at all. This open nature has also turned out\nto be an important factor in HUAWEI\u2019s continued development of EMUI and\nHarmony OS following US trade sanctions.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that most phone manufacturers obtain versions of\nAOSP from chipset vendors like Qualcomm. This is because Android has to be\ntailored to low-level hardware via drivers. This has historically been the\ncause of delayed Android updates and limited years of update support.\nUltimately, Google is happy with this arrangement, as it encourages developers\nto use Android for a wide range of internet-connected gadgets. In return, an\narray of companies each contribute fixes and improvements to the OS. It\u2019s a\nwin-win.\n\n## What does the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) mean?\n\nAs I\u2019m sure you can imagine, operating systems are complex beasts and Android\nis no different. AOSP covers a range of software layers within the operating\nsystem, providing access points and tools for hardware and app developers\nalike. You may have also heard that Android is based on Linux, which has some\ndegree of truth to it.\n\nSo just like in a regular Linux computer, the \u201clower-level\u201d layers are where\ndevice manufacturers code the OS to work with their specific hardware. The\nkernel, for example, is the core program that manages the CPU resources,\nsystem memory, networking, etc, so that apps and services can run. The\nHardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) layer links common app APIs for Bluetooth,\nsound, etc, with the device\u2019s microphone, speakers, and more.\n\n#### Latest deals on top tech\n\nSee all deals\n\n  * Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen, USB-C)\n\n28% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n  * Motorola Edge (2023)\n\n41% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n  * Samsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\n23% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n  * Fitbit Charge 6\n\n12% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n  * Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)\n\n31% off\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\n\u201cHigher-level\u201d layers are used by app developers. Native Libraries enable\ndevelopers to build content with commonly supported low-level libraries like\nOpenGL ES, Webkit, and more. Above that, Android Frameworks provides app\ndevelopers with hook-ins for common OS functions that we all use every day.\nThese range from location data, push notifications, and making phone calls.\nThe Android Runtime is the middle man, converting app code into native\ninstructions for the underlying hardware.\n\nCombined, the Android Open Source Project stack (pictured above) is a complete\nsolution for Android hardware and software developers.\n\nThe AOSP isn\u2019t just an ever-growing codebase though. Google also provides\ndesign and development tools as part of the project, ranging from\ncompatibility documentation to best security practices and app design\nprinciples. Google also hosts a selection of test suites to help developers\nensure their devices implement APIs and features correctly.\n\n## What\u2019s the difference between AOSP and stock Android?\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nThe Android Open Source Project is often confused with \u201cstock Android\u201d but\nthat\u2019s an oversimplification.\n\nWhile the AOSP contains everything developers need to build Android, it\ncrucially doesn\u2019t include everything you need for a finished smartphone. This\nis because Google and the AOSP can\u2019t provide kernel device drivers for every\nhardware configuration out there. By device driver, we mean the firmware\nrequired for a phone\u2019s hardware, such as the processor or cameras. Phone and\nSoC manufacturers, such as Qualcomm and Samsung, have to incorporate these\ndrivers into their respective Android builds. This is partly why updates take\ntime to trickle down from AOSP to the smartphone in your hand.\n\nAOSP also doesn\u2019t come with Google\u2019s suite of software applications, such as\nits Chrome browser, YouTube, and even the Google Play Store. It also doesn\u2019t\ninclude a number of Google\u2019s under-the-hood technologies and APIs that enable\nfeatures like mobile payments, voice commands, and cloud storage. These are\nlicensed separately to manufacturers as Google Mobile Services (GMS). These\napps and services allow Google to profit from Android without charging\nanything upfront.\n\n\"AOSP doesn't include Google apps or even hardware-specific drivers.\"\n\nWhen HUAWEI lost access to US technologies, it could no longer license GMS but\ncould keep using AOSP. As such, HUAWEI began replacing GMS features with its\nin-house HUAWEI Mobile Service (HMS). However, this means that apps that rely\non GMS have to be rebuilt using HMS to work correctly. Hence why you can\u2019t be\nguaranteed to find your favorite Android apps on the latest HUAWEI devices.\n\nAny manufacturer that wants to install GMS on top of Android has to obtain a\nGMS license and a Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA) for their\ndevice and then pass several compatibility tests. There\u2019s the Android\nCompatibility Test Suite (CTS) to validate software and hardware components\nand APIs. Then, the Google Mobile Services Test Suite (GTS) and Vendor Test\nSuite (VTS) test multimedia capabilities, OS kernel, and HAL capabilities.\nAnother condition for obtaining a GMS license is to pre-load a number of\nGoogle\u2019s apps on a new device.\n\nThe difference between AOSP and GMS has become a very important distinction\nfollowing the US-China trade dispute.\n\n## The future of AOSP\n\nHadlee Simons / Android Authority\n\nThe Android Open Source Project continues to be the foundation of Android\u2019s\nsuccess, thanks to countless hours of developer input from around the world.\nWhile Android devices aren\u2019t going anywhere soon, Google may already be\nlooking for a future operating system.\n\nGoogle Fuchsia first popped up on GitHub in August 2016 but we\u2019ve heard little\nabout it since. We still don\u2019t know too much about Fuchsia for smartphones.\nThat said, it appears to be designed for an even wider range of devices than\nAndroid. Fuchsia also features Google\u2019s own non-Linux kernel called Zircon and\nsupports Google\u2019s Dart scripting language. At the moment, Fuchsia is open-\nsource and free, just like Android. Let\u2019s hope any future plans stay that way.\nInterested developers can download and build the OS from the Fushsia website.\n\n### FAQs\n\nGoogle is the lead maintainer of the Android Open Source Project, which means\nit has the final say in changes and improvements. However, it can be freely\nadopted by anyone for their own needs.\n\nNo, the Android OS you\u2019ll find on phones and tablets include many pieces of\nadditional software on top of vanilla AOSP.\n\n## You might like\n\nGuides\n\nAndroid\n\n## Welcome to Android Authority\n\n# Android Authority asks for your consent to use your personal data to:\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 304 TCF vendor(s) and 181 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
