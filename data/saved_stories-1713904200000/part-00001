Ever since the Spanish conquistadors drained Lake Texcoco to make\nway for more urbanization, the land has been gradually compacting under the\nweight. It\u2019s a phenomenon known as subsidence, and the result is grim: Mexico\nCity is sinking up to 20 inches a year, unleashing havoc on its\ninfrastructure.\n\nThat includes the city\u2019s Metro system, the second-largest in North America\nafter New York City\u2019s. Now, satellites have allowed scientists to meticulously\nmeasure the rate of sinking across Mexico City, mapping where subsidence has\nthe potential to damage railways. \u201cWhen you\u2019re here in the city, you get used\nto buildings being tilted a little,\u201d says Dar\u00edo Solano\u2010Rojas, a remote-sensing\nscientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \u201cYou can feel how\nthe rails are wobbly. Riding the Metro in Mexico City feels weird. You don\u2019t\nknow if it\u2019s dangerous or not \u2014 you feel like it\u2019s dangerous, but you don\u2019t\nhave that certainty.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published by Wired and is reproduced here as part of\nthe Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nIn a recent study in the journal Scientific Reports, Solano\u2010Rojas went in\nsearch of certainty. Using radar satellite data, he and his team measured how\nthe elevation changed across the city between 2011 and 2020. Subsidence isn\u2019t\nuniform; the rate depends on several factors. The most dramatic instances\nglobally are due to the overextraction of groundwater: Pump enough liquid out\nand the ground collapses like an empty water bottle. That\u2019s why Jakarta,\nIndonesia, is sinking up to 10 inches a year. Over in California\u2019s San Joaquin\nValley, the land has sunk as much as 28 feet in the past century, due to\nfarmers pumping out too much groundwater.\n\nA similar draining of aquifers is happening in Mexico City, which is gripped\nby a worsening water crisis. \u201cThe subsurface is like a sponge: We get the\nwater out, and then it deforms, because it\u2019s losing volume,\u201d says\nSolano\u2010Rojas. How much volume depends on the underlying sediment in a given\npart of the city \u2014 the ancient lake didn\u2019t neatly layer equal proportions of\nclay and sand in every area. \u201cThat produces a lot of different behaviors on\nthe surface,\u201d Solano\u2010Rojas adds.\n\nSubsidence rates across Mexico City vary substantially, from 20 inches\nannually to not at all, where the city is built atop solid volcanic rock. This\ncreates \u201cdifferential subsidence,\u201d where the land sinks differently not just\nsquare mile to square mile, or block to block, but square foot to square foot.\nIf a road, railway, or building is sinking differently at one end than the\nother, it\u2019ll destabilize.\n\nTilted road traffic barriers at Acatitla Station caused by differential\nsubsidence, where the land sinks unevenly.

And below, the deformation of tracks at Ocean\u00eda Station. If in either\nof these places the land was subsiding at a uniform rate, the tracks and road\nwould also sink uniformly, and you might not have a problem. \u201cWe found that\nsome of the segments of the Metro system are moving faster\u201d than it was\ndesigned for, says Solano\u2010Rojas. The study found that nearly half of elevated\nsegments of the Metro are experiencing differential subsidence. This would\nimply that they would need to be serviced before the system\u2019s typical\nthreshold of 50 years, at which point a segment would need rehabilitation or\nrepair to continue optimal operation.\n\nSistema de Transporte Colectivo, which operates the Mexico City Metro, did not\nprovide comment for this story after repeated inquiries.\n\nDeformation of tracks at Ocean\u00eda Station cause by differences in subsidence\nrates.

As the land sinks, it can create divots for\nrainwater to accumulate, causing flooding along railways. That can mess with\nthe electrical system that powers the trains, Solano\u2010Rojas says.\n\nAnd elevation changes can increase the grade of the rails. The Metro\u2019s trains\nare designed to operate on a maximum slope of 3.5 percent, Solano\u2010Rojas says,\nbut some stretches of track are now double that due to subsidence. \u201cTrains can\nget derailed very easily if there is a slight change in the leveling of the\nrailways,\u201d says Manoochehr Shirzaei, an environmental security expert at\nVirginia Tech who studies subsidence but wasn\u2019t involved in the new paper.\n\u201cMost of the infrastructure has certain thresholds; it tolerates a certain\nlevel of differential land subsidence. But often they don\u2019t account for the\nrate that we see, for example, in Mexico City.\u201d\n\n#### Related\n\nA Fight Over Water, With Hints of the Future\n\nSolano\u2010Rojas and his colleagues found subsidence in the area of an overpass\nnear the Olivos station, which collapsed in 2021 while a Metro train was\ntraveling over it. \u201cWe did part of this analysis before 2021, and we detected\nthat that area was having differential displacements,\u201d says Solano\u2010Rojas. \u201cWe\nwere like, \u2018Oh, yeah, it looks like something could be happening here in the\nfuture.\u2019 We think that it\u2019s not a coincidence that we found this.\u201d\nSolano\u2010Rojas was careful to say that the potential contribution of subsidence\nto the disaster would require further evaluation, and official investigations\nhave cited construction errors and do not mention subsidence.\n\nFor this study, the researchers looked at the Metro infrastructure\naboveground, not the subway segments \u2014 basically, the parts of the system they\ncould verify visually. (The photo below shows the differential subsidence of\ncolumns supporting an overpass.) But by providing the system\u2019s operators with\ninformation on how quickly its infrastructure might be subsiding, their work\ncan hopefully inform interventions. Engineers can add material underneath\nrailways, for instance, to restore lost elevation. Bolstering subways, though,\ncould be much more challenging. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a concrete solution for that,\u201d\nsays Shirzaei. \u201cIn most cases, when that happens, it just results in shutting\ndown the project and trying to open a new lane.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t just Mexico City\u2019s problem. Earlier this year, Shirzaei and his\ncolleagues found that the East Coast\u2019s infrastructure is in serious trouble\ndue to slower \u2014 yet steady \u2014 subsidence. They calculated that 29,000 square\nmiles of the Atlantic Coast are exposed to sinking of up to 0.08 inches a\nyear, affecting up to 14 million people and 6 million properties. Some 1,400\nsquare miles are sinking up to 0.20 inches a year.\n\nDifferential subsidence of columns supporting an overpass.

A metropolis like New York City has the added problem of sheer\nweight pushing down on the ground, which alone leads to subsidence. The Bay\nArea, too, is sinking. On either coast, subsidence is greatly exacerbating the\nproblem of sea level rise: The land is going down just as the water is coming\nup.\n\nWherever in the world it\u2019s happening, people have to stop overextracting\ngroundwater to slow subsidence. Newfangled systems are already relieving\npressure on aquifers. It\u2019s getting cheaper and cheaper to recycle toilet water\ninto drinking water, for instance. And more cities are deploying \u201csponge\u201d\ninfrastructure \u2014 lots of green spaces that allow rainwater to soak into the\nunderlying aquifer, essentially reinflating the land to fend off subsidence.\nSuch efforts are increasingly urgent as climate change exacerbates droughts in\nmany parts of the world, including Mexico City, putting ever more pressure on\ngroundwater supplies.\n\nWith increasing satellite data, cities can get a better handle on the\nsubsidence they can\u2019t immediately avoid. \u201cI really feel like governments have\na chance to use these kinds of studies to have a more structured plan of\naction,\u201d says Solano\u2010Rojas.\n\nMatt Simon is a senior staff writer at Wired covering biology, robotics, and\nthe environment.
