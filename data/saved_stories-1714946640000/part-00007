Whilst it is commonplace for objects such as door\nhandles and hospital bedrails to be made of or to be coated with copper, other\nhigh-touch surfaces such as those of screens and monitors would lose their\noptical transparency. Herein, we report the design of a transparent\nantimicrobial nanostructured copper surface obtained by dewetting ultrathin\nmetal copper films on glass. Antimicrobial effectiveness of >99.9 % was\nobtained within 2 h against Staphylococcus aureus following the US\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Test method. Moreover, the proposed surfaces\nshow an average transmittance between 70\u201380% with little color in the visible\nrange. Additionally, they maintain optical and antimicrobial properties after\nabrasion and chemical exposure tests designed to replicate physical wear and\nrepeated exposure to biocidal cleaning materials. With the demonstrated\nsurfaces\u2019 antimicrobial, colorless, and durability properties, they have\npotential in applications such as touch-enabled public or personal displays\nonce higher transparency is achieved.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Antibacterial activity testing methods for hydrophobic patterned surfaces\n\nArticle Open access 23 March 2021\n\n### Antimicrobial properties of a multi-component alloy\n\nArticle Open access 11 December 2022\n\n### Selective antibiofilm properties and biocompatibility of nano-ZnO and\nnano-ZnO/Ag coated surfaces\n\nArticle Open access 10 August 2020\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the potential of surfaces to harbor harmful microorganisms\nhas attracted great attention. Together with increased awareness, there is now\na growing demand for effective disinfection practices of personal and multi-\nuser touch activated displays, in which traditional methods such as sprayable\nalcohol are impractical. More specifically, coatings containing antimicrobial\n(AM) constituents are a promising solution for glass, when they are\ntransparent, durable during its use case and resistant to general use wear-\nand-tear^1,2,3.\n\nSeveral reports have promoted the use of nanostructured or ultrathin metals\nand their oxides in transparent applications including directly into the glass\nitself or as part of a surface coating. Popular approaches of surface coatings\ninclude the use of photocatalytic metal oxides such as titanium dioxide\n(TiO_2) or zinc oxide (ZnO)^1,2. These materials interact with moisture and\nlight to produce bactericidal reactive oxygen ion species which are harmful to\nthe microbes present on the surface. Whilst effective, these coatings are\nlight activated and would not be suitable for indoor environments. Subsequent\ncoating studies have explored the combination of pure metallic species with\nphotocatalytic oxides to afford dual-functionality coatings with AM function\nirrespective of light availiability^3,4. In addition, recently, ion-exchanged\nglass has been touted as a promising approach. In this, sodium ions near the\nglass surface are exchanged for silver ions in an ion exchange process. This\nleads to the formation of an AM Ag-ion containing diffusive layer in the\nsurface of the glass^5. These have superb optical performance but rapid\nbacterial burden reduction (as tested pursuant to US EPA protocol) is a\nchallenge.\n\nThe use of Cu in various supporting media has been highly reported in AM\ncoatings for bedrails and intravenous stand poles^6,7 in hospital settings as\nwell as for AM glass ceramics^8. However, for application on transparent high-\ntouch surfaces such as tablets and mobile devices, a high level of\ntransparency of the overlying antibacterial coating is essential to preserve\nthe functionality of the device. To achieve transparency, Cu ions have\npreviously been embedded into or deposited on top of a polymer matrix^9,10,11\nor in a nanocomposite with SiO_2^12,13,14,15. The AM activity of copper-\ncontaining surfaces is dependent on their ability to release free Cu ions (i.e\nCu^+ and Cu^2+) by aqueous corrosion processes^16,17. The dominant process(es)\ntaking place are determined by the starting oxidation state of the copper, the\nprevailing environmental (e.g., relative humidity, temperature) and chemical\nconditions (e.g., air constituents, sweat contaminants). Once released, the\nCu^+/Cu^2+ exert cytotoxic effects by participating in cyclic redox reactions\nat the cell surface^18. For example, charged ions may accumulate on the\nnegatively charged domains of the bacterial membrane, altering its\npermeability and causing leakage of intracellular components^19. Ion channels\nwithin the membrane also permit the transport of nanoparticles (NPs) into\nbacterial cells where they release ions, which subsequently generate\nintracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydrogen peroxide\n(H_2O_2), superoxide (O_2^\u2022\u2212), hydroxyl radical (^\u2022OH), and singlet oxygen^20.\nThese species induce oxidative stresses to intracellular components, denature\nproteins, alter the structure of DNA and de-regulate cellular\nmetabolism^21,22,23,24.\n\nWhilst Cu has been demonstrated as a potent AM agent^9,13,25,26,27,28,29,30, a\nCu containing transparent AM coating is yet to be fully realized due to the\nopacity of metallic copper and oxide coatings. Furthermore, for applications\nsuch as touch-enabled public or personal displays, lack of electrical\ninsulation destroys the touch functionality. In this regard, Behzadinasab et\nal. developed two transparent, sprayable polydopamine (PDA) & copper- based\nsurface coatings for glass^10. Using a thin layer of copper deposited on a PDA\nlayer, they achieved a reduction of >99.99% of P. aeruginosa and 99.18% of\nMRSA within 10 min compared to a glass control, as well as 99.98% reduction of\nSARS-CoV-2 virus in 1 h. Using a sparse layer of Cu_2O bound to the PDA, they\nobtained a reduction of 99.94% of P. aeruginosa and 96.82% of MRSA within 10\nmin, as well as 99.88% of SARS- CoV-2 virus in 1 h compared to a glass\ncontrol. The same group also tested transparent AM coatings of silver oxide\nparticles in a silicate matrix on glass^31. The coatings demonstrated at least\na 99.8% decrease in SARS-CoV-2, MRSA, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa in 1 h, and\nwere transparent and allowed retain touch screen function^31.\n\nIn this work, we present a design of a transparent, non-conductive, AM\nnanostructured Cu surface (TANCS) on glass substrates. Our design satisfies\nseveral criteria; (1) the Cu release rate is be controlled by a supporting\nmedium such that coating remains permanently AM and still transparent; (2) the\ncoating imparts the desired AM function without altering the original\nperformance of the substrate; (3) the Cu film or nanoparticles when deposited\non substrate do not impact significantly the transparency and color of the\noriginal substrate; (4) the surfaces with the nanostructured coating are\ndurable and retain their AM property, after repeated and extended use; for\nexample, they should be resistant to oxidation (the transformation of Cu into\nCuO_x leads to a lessening of AM effect) and mechanical abrasion.\n\nThe TANCS demonstrated a high average transparency, i.e., average transmission\nincluding substrate between 70% and 80% in the range of 380\u2013750 nm, flatness\nof transmission in the visible range, thereby, producing no distracting color\neffect, killing over 99.9% of Staphylococcus aureus within 2 h and maintaining\nthe AM activity after rigorous wipe testing in accordance to the EPA \u2018Test\nMethod for Efficacy of Cu Alloy Surfaces as a Sanitizer\u2019^32. Our design and\nmethod entail thermal dewetting of ultrathin metal films (UTMFs) to form\ndewetted Cu nanoparticles (Cu DNPs) with optimized size for providing the AM\neffect, transparency, color neutrality and electrical insulation. The design,\nshown schematically in Fig. 1, also includes additional functional layers of\nSiO_2 and fluorosilanes, which are deposited conformally on top of the\ndewetted Cu DNPs. Together, these additional layers provide an easy means of\ntuning Cu exposed to the environment and microbes. In addition, by anchoring\nthe particles to the substrate, they enhance the coating\u2019s durability and\nprotect against environmental oxidation, external chemical agents, and\nmechanical forces without sacrificing its overall transparency.\n\nFig. 1: Schematic illustration of the TANCS.\n\nThey comprise: (I) 0.3 mm thick CORNING\u00ae GORILLA\u00ae GLASS substrate, (II)\ndewetted Cu nanoparticles (NPs) from a UTMF of 3.5 nm Cu, (III) SiO_2\nembedding layer and (IV) Easy-To-Clean (ETC) Fluorosilane coating. Dimensions\nare not in scale. The difference in shape (e.g., contact angle) of the\nparticles reflects the real images, an example being that shown in Fig. 2.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn this paper, TANCS morphology, transmittance, AM efficacy, mechanical\ndurability, and trade-offs of these properties were investigated. Metal\ndewetting for nanostructuring the surface of glass substrates has already been\nused^33,34,35,36,37. However, to our knowledge, it is the first time it has\nbeen used for AM properties. Such process has the advantage of being simple\nand scalable as it does not rely on time-consuming and sophisticated\nlithography techniques (e.g., electron beam and nanoimprint). Finally, being\nelectrically insulating, TANCS would be appropriate for application in\ncapacitive touch-activated devices.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Fabrication of TANCS\n\nIon-exchanged glass substrates from Corning Incorporated (Gorilla\u00ae Glass\u00ae)\nwith a size of 2 \u00d7 2 in.^2 and 0.3 mm thickness were sonicated in conventional\norganic solvents for 10 min and dried with an N_2 gun. For comparative\nexperiments, where the dewetting process was performed at temperature greater\nthan the IOX-exchanged glass strain point, fused silica substrates were used\n(Results and discussion). A magnetron sputtering system (ATC Orion 8, AJA\nInternational, Inc.) was used for the metal depositions. A pre-deposition\ncleaning of the substrates was performed by exposing the substrates to an Ar\nplasma (bias power 40 W, pressure 8 mT, Ar flow 20 standard cubic centimeters\nper minute (scc/min)) for 5 min. An ultrathin titanium (Ti) adhesion layer\nwith a thickness of 2 nm onto the flat glass substrates was deposited from a\ntarget of 99.7% purity with a Direct Current (DC) power of 100 W and a working\npressure of 2 mTorr in an argon atmosphere (20 scc/min). This was followed by\na deposition of an ultrathin Cu film with a thickness of 3.5 nm as shown in\nFig. 1. The Cu film thickness was controlled by the sputtering time. The\ndepositions were performed at a base pressure between 10^\u22127 and 10^\u22128 Torr,\nroom temperature, 100 W of DC power, and 20 scc/min of pure argon (Ar). The\nworking pressure was 1.5 \u00d7 10^\u22123 Torr, the deposition rate was estimated to be\n0.0454 nm/s for Ti and 0.142 nm/s for Cu, and the target\u2212substrate distance\nwas 35 cm with a rotation speed of 60 rpm. To obtain nanoparticles, the\nsamples were subjected to a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process as shown in\nFig. 2. The RTA was carried out in the Tsunami TM RTP-600S system at the\ntemperature of 390 \u00b0C, below the glass strain point temperature of the\nsubstrate (580 \u00b0C), for 600 s. High-purity N_2 gas (1 atm pressure) was used\nto reduce the oxidation of the metal film. After RTA, 10 to 50 nm of SiO_2\nwere deposited conformally onto the Cu nanoparticles by using E-beam\nevaporation system (Lesker LAB 18 Thin Film Deposition System), as shown in\nFig. 1. The deposition was performed at a base pressure between 10^\u22127 and\n10^\u22128 Torr, room temperature. The SiO_2 E-beam evaporation rate was set to 1\nA/s as measured by a quartz microbalance. Thickness tested ranged between 0\nand 50 nm to provide partial coverage the nanoparticles whilst allowing\noptimization of the durability and AM property of the coating. As a final\nstep, the nanostructured surface may be coated with a low surface energy\ncoating, such as a fluorosilane. Both continuous and patterned fluorosilane\ncoating methods were evaluated to obtain the best performance. Prior to the\nfluorosilane application, the coated substrates were cleaned with an oxygen\nplasma of strength between 50\u2013300 W for a time of 2\u20135 min. The fluorosilane\nused in this work was Optool UD509 obtained from Daikin Chemicals and it was\ndiluted to 0.005\u20130.024 % by weight in a fluorinated solvent (Novec HFE7200)\nobtained from 3 M Company. The fluorosilane was deposited onto the substrate\nby spray-coating using an airbrush. The airbrush was held 2 in. away from the\nAM coating and sprayed for 20 s to enable even coverage. In cases where\npatterned coverage was desired, a mask was used. The pressure of the airbrush\nwas varied between 6 and 35 psi. Finally, the fluorosilane was cured at 150\n\u00b0C, <10 min or in a desiccator at room temperature (RT) for 2 days. The\ncoating was then rinsed or sonicated in fluorinated solvent (NovecTM HFE7200\nfrom 3 M Company) for a time of 3\u20135 min to remove excess material. In this\nwork, AM efficacy against S.Aureus was performed on 3 sets of TANCSs, with\nvarying SiO_2 thickness, fluorosilane concentration and oxidation conditions,\naccording to Table 1. A schematic of the fabrication process is provided in\nSupplementary Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 2: Morphological properties and optical response of CuDNPs.\n\nSEM images (a) clearly illustrate the influence of the annealing temperature\non the particle shape and size. High temperature produces separate, rounded\nparticles with a contact angle \\\\(\\approx\\\\)90\u00b0, whilst low temperature\nproduces, flatter particles, with a contact angle \\\\( < \\\\) 90\u00b0 and that are\nsometimes in contact. Scale bar = 100 nm. Optical spectra obtained from\nexperiment (b) and modeling (c). Modeling qualitatively reproduces the\nexperiments, in particular the red shift and broadening of the plasmonic\nresonance due to a reduction of particle\u2019s contact angle. Insets of (b) show\nthe color of the coatings against white background and also against a colored\ntext background to show transparency and color neutrality of the TANCS. The\nsize of the samples is 2 x 2 in.^2. The insets of (c) show the particle shape\nused for the modeling as determined from the SEM images in a.\n\nFull size image\n\nTable 1 TANCS coatings (A and B type) together with control (ctrl) samples\n\nFull size table\n\n### Antimicrobial (AM) efficacy testing of TANCS\n\nBactericidal efficacy testing on the TANCSs, stainless steel (SS), uncoated\nglass and Cu control samples were performed as described in the EPA test for\nefficacy of Cu alloy surfaces as a sanitizer^32. Each coupon was tested in\nduplicate. Prior to AM testing, all coupons were cleaned by immersion in a 75%\nethanol solution followed by rinsing with deionized (DI) water. The coupons\nwere then sterilized by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light at 254 nm, for a\nduration of 15 min. For the preparation of the inoculum, a 20 \u03bcL aliquot of\nthawed bacterial Staphylococcus aureus AT 6538 (S.Aureus) culture was added to\n10 mL Tryptic Soy Broth. The bacterial suspension was incubated at 36 \u00b0C for\n48 h. The culture was subsequently centrifuged and allowed to settle as a\npellet. The supernatant was removed and pellet was resuspended in 6 mL of\nphosphate buffer saline (PBS). The upper two thirds of suspension were\naspirated and the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured to obtain the\nbacterial density estimation. The cell culture was diluted with PBS to achieve\na bacterial inoculum concentration near the target value of 1.0 \u00d7 10^6 colony-\nforming units (CFU) mL^\u22121. Organic soil load containing 250 \u03bcL fetal bovine\nserum (FBS) and 50 \u03bcL TritonX were added to 4700 \u03bcL of the inoculum. Here, FBS\nis used as a universal growth supplement for in vitro culture and TritonX to\naid in spreading of the inoculum on the substrates. Each coupon was inoculated\nwith 20 \u03bcL of inoculum, that was spread evenly over a central 1 \u00d7 1 in.^2 test\narea of the coupon using bent sterile pipette tips. The 20 \u03bcL on the coupon\ntypically dry within 5\u201315 min in ambient conditions. Once dry, the coupons\nwere incubated in a controlled environment set at 42% relative humidity (RH)\nand 23 \u00b0C for a period of 2 h. Following the 2 h exposure period, the coupons\nwere neutralized in Letheen broth (Gen Lab). Ten-fold serial dilutions of the\nneutralized solutions were plated using standard spread plate technique on\nTryptic Soy Agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 36 \u00b0C to yield countable\nnumbers of survivors (~20\u2013200 colonies per plate). This range was selected\nbecause below 20 CFUs it gives poor counting statistics and above 200 CFUs the\nbacteria grow too close to each others.\n\n### Calculations of log and percentage of reductions\n\nThe calculation of the value of the AM activity is based on the difference\nbetween the mean number of the log_10 of bacteria surviving on the TANCS test\nand the mean number of the log_10 of bacteria surviving on the glass cover\nslip control samples according to the EPA protocol provided in the\nSupplementary Note 2^32. The experiments were performed in duplicate. For the\ncoatings to be approved as a \u201cself-sanitizing\u201d, the AM test must demonstrate\nat least a 3-Log Reduction (3-LR) within the specified contact time. This\ncorresponds to a 99.9% reduction in CFUs.\n\n### Stipulated wear testing\n\nTANCSs were subjected to a modified cleaning regimen suitable for electronic\nglass display covers based on EPA test method for efficacy of copper alloy\nsurfaces as a sanitizer^32. The cleaning regimen was designed to test the\ndurability of the TANCS against abrasion from wiping with a cleaning cloth,\nfrequent contact with a pants pocket or purse during removal and insertion,\ntouching with a human finger, and/or chemical interaction with the environment\nor cleaning solutions. The abrasion procedures simulate regular touch and a\nworst-case scenario of 2\u00d7 cleaning every day for up to 2 years. Simulated wear\nwas performed using an Elcometer 5750 Taber\u00ae Linear Abrader. For wet abrasion,\nthe cleaning solution was prepared with either isopropanol (IPA) and deionized\n(DI) water (70:30) or Lysol\u00ae. A cover glass wipe was saturated with cleaning\nsolution and attached to the abrader head using double-sided adhesive tape. No\nadditional weights were added to the spline-shaft of the linear abrader (base\nload of 350 g) in order to keep the pressure similar to that applied in by\nrepeated touch or cloth wipes. One complete wear cycle consisted in 2 passes\nof the wet (or dry) cover glass wipe against the test surface. This process\nwas repeated for 700\u20131200 cycles (1400\u20132400 passes of the wet scouring pad) to\nsimulate wear and cleaning for up to 2 years. After completion of the wear\ncycles, the \u2018worn\u2019 surfaces were tested for bacterial efficacy against\nS.Aureus using the EPA testing procedure detailed in \u201cAntimicrobial (AM)\nefficacy testing of TANCS\u201d.\n\n### Inductively coupled mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) mock testing to\ncharacterize amount of leached copper from TANCS\n\nThe number of Cu ions from coating that equilibrate with those in the liquid\ninoculum in the AM test was estimated using a mock test that mimics the AM\ntest\u2014the mock test keeps all conditions the same as the AM test except it has\nno bacteria in the inoculum. The control and test coupons are treated with the\nsame cleaning and sterilization process as for the EPA AM test (see in the\nSupplementary Note 2). 20 \u03bcL aliquot of inoculum (without bacteria) was added\nto the central 1 in.^2 area of the TANCS. The leaching was performed in\ncontrolled environment set at 42% RH and 23 \u00b0C for a period of 2 h. The\nleachate was collected from the coating by using 2 \u00d7 150 \u03bcL of PBS in the\nexposed 1 in.^2 region, rinsing and removing the rinse solution into a tube.\nThe amount of Cu in the leached solution was determined using ICP/MS\ndetection. Positive and negative controls were run with pure Cu and stainless\nsteel coupons, respectively. The optical response of the coating after mock\ntesting in the region 350\u2013750 nm was also obtained.\n\n### Morphological, optical, mechanical, and antimicrobial characterizations of\nthe coatings\n\nThe optical transmission spectra of the coatings in the wavelength range\n380\u2013750 nm was acquired using a spectrometer (Perkin Elmer LAMBDA 950). All of\nthe reported transmission spectra represent the substrate and coating i.e.,\nbare (uncoated) glass + Ti adhesion layer + dewetted Cu + SiO_2 +\nfluorosilane. Haze measurements were obtained using a BYK Haze-Guard iPro\nsystem. The wetting characteristic of the coated and uncoated substrates was\ndetermined by measuring the water contact angle (WCA) using a drop shape\nanalysis system (DSA-100, Kr\u00fcss GmbH). Five measurements at different points\nof each sample were taken, and the average and standard deviation reported.\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a FEI-SEM, FEI\nInspect F. ImageJ software^38 was used to obtain the particle size\ndistribution through SEM image analysis.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Morphological, optical, and electrical properties\n\nThe Cu UTMF annealing was performed at low temperature (390 \u00b0C), i.e.,\nsufficiently close to the temperature at above which dewetting of the\ncontinuous film is observed and below the glass strain point of the substrate\n(580 \u00b0C). By doing so, we intentionally introduce a degree of inhomogeneity\ninto the contact angle, size and morphology of the particles obtained such\nthat the plasmonic resonance effect on the coloring of the coating is kept\nwithin acceptable values. To provide a comparison and demonstrate the\nadvantage of low temperature dewetting, a theoretical and experimental study\nwas performed to compare high temperature (750 \u00b0C) and low temperature (390\n\u00b0C) annealing cases. The study was performed on fused silica substrates\nbecause they have a higher strain point temperature (893 \u00b0C) and can withstand\nthe 750 \u00b0C annealing condition without deformation. Electromagnetic\nsimulations were performed using Finite Element Method with commercial COMSOL\nMultiphysics\u00ae software^39. The theoretical model, detailed in the\nSupplementary Note 1, is based on a simplified 2D array of Cu nanoparticles on\nglass substrate, and thus enables a qualitative rather than quantitative\ncomparison with experimental data, still reproducing the experimental trends.\nThe unit cells used for the simulations for the two different geometries are\nprovided in Supplementary Fig. 3. Experimentally we observed that: (i) low\ntemperature produces flatter nanoparticles with a lower contact angle, (ii)\nnanoparticles are much closer together, and in some cases, in contact with\neach other (Fig. 2a), (iii) high temperature annealing produced the typical\nnarrowband resonance centered around 580 nm with pinkish color, while the same\nprocess at low temperature produced a broader resonance at longer wavelength\nwith paler bluish color (Fig. 2b). The mean dewetted particle size was 72 nm \u00b1\n24 nm and 55 nm \u00b1 16 nm for the low and high temperature dewetting cases,\nrespectively. Note that in the case where the particle is non-spherical, the\nparticle size refers to the longest lateral edge to edge distance of the\nfeature. The simulated optical spectra show a trend in good agreement with the\nexperimental observations and support a red-shift and broadening of the\nplasmonic resonance in the low temperature annealing condition due to a lower\ncontact angle, this being consistent with previous work^33. The change in\nparticles\u2019 structure and associated optical response give the coating a\ntransparency without strong dependence on wavelength. We have also measured\nlow scattering (haze) <1%. The inset of Fig. 2b shows transparency and color\nneutrality of the low temperature dewetted TANCS against white and colored\ntext backgrounds. The TANCS remains visually close to the neutral color of the\nsubstrate and have a transmission between 70\u201380% that is almost independent of\nwavelength in the visible range. Product modeling for capacitive touch devices\nwas also performed for the TANCS using the Finite Element Model (Supplementary\nFig. 2). The predictions show that our TANCS coatings do not prohibitively\nimpact the scale and frequency dependence of the surface-lateral electrical\nimpedance in the 1 MHz to 100 MHz frequency range required by touch-enabled\ndevices. This suggests that TANCS coatings on glass would retain touch screen\nfunctionality.\n\n### AM activity of TANCS\n\nMock and AM testing was performed on TANCSs, whose conditions are presented in\nTable 1. A practical requirement for touch screen application is the ability\nto continually release Cu ions in optimal concentrations over a long period of\ntime without compromising the overall transparency, durability, and\nfunctionality of the coating. Figure 3a plots the data of LR from AM test\nagainst the data of Cu leaching from the mock test. Raw data for the AM\ntesting is provided in Supplementary Table 1. The LR correlates positively\nwith the amount Cu leached into the solution up to ~4 mg/L after which\nincreased Cu dissolution does not significantly increase the LR. By this, we\ndetermined the minimum inhibitory concentration of Cu (MIC-Cu) needed in\nsolution to reach the EPA requirement of 3-LR, equivalent to 99.9% kill, to be\n\\\\(\\sim \\\\!\\\\)2 mg/L. The bacterial killing mechanism could be explained by\ndiffusion of mobile Cu ions through the SiO_2 and fluorosilane capping layers\nto the coating\u2019s surface where they interact with and kill the\nsuspended/floating microbes. The diffusion of Cu ions is mediated by a liquid\nvehicle - e.g., cleaning solvents, surface moisture or the PBS solution\nhosting the bacteria. Based on a MIC-Cu of \\\\(\\sim\\\\)2 mg/L and, assuming a\nuniform distribution of microorganisms in the fluid, the number of ions, n,\navailable to each microorganism are in the order of 10^11 (see calculations\nprovided in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). This is orders of\nmagnitude over the natural intracellular concentration of Cu atoms/ions in\nS.Aureus, which is reported to be in the region of 10^4\u201310^5 ^40. Therefore,\nit is reasonable to assume that TANCSs impose their AM activity by releasing\nCu ions in sufficient concentrations for this specific bacteria. In general,\nthe AM action due to the release of the ions is due to a combination of the\nmaterial and the surface geometry. The presence of nanoparticles enhances the\nrelease of the ions compared to the bulk as the surface/volume ratio is\nhigher^41.\n\nFig. 3: Antimicrobial properties of TANCS.\n\na LR vs [Cu] leached. The EPA-prescribed 3-LR, corresponding to >99.9%\nreduction in bacterial colony counts, is marked with a black line. The blue\nand pink shaded regions correspond to the [Cu] range above and below which a\n3-LR was observed, respectively. *The comparison between LR and [Cu] leached\nassumes that the majority of the ions are held in the liquid phase and not\nconsumed by the microorganisms i.e., rate of Cu dissolution due to the PBS >>\nrate of consumption of Cu due to the presence of microorganisms. b\nTransmission spectra of representative TANCSs. For both graphs, the circle and\nsquare markers represent TANCSs from Sets A and B, respectively. Inset of (b)\nshows photographs of Set A and Set B after mock testing where the marked\ncentral region marked shows the testing area of 1 \u00d7 1 in.^2.\n\nFull size image\n\nFor assessment of the optical properties, the transmission of the coatings in\nthe visible region was measured before and after mock testing. Figure 3b shows\nthe optical spectra and photographs corresponding to TANCS leaching <2 mg/L Cu\n(squares) and >4 mg/L Cu (circles). Both cases show an increase in\ntransmission after mock testing in the region of the plasmonic resonance\nassociated with the Cu DNPs. This can be explained by reduced plasmonic\ncoupling, as Cu dissolves into solution, the DNPs decrease in dimensions,\nreducing the interactions that give rise to plasmonic coupling. The\ndistinction between Set A and B lies in the strength and duration of oxygen\nplasma cleaning treatment prior to the fluorosilane application. Set A TANCSs\nwere treated with 50 W for 2 min whilst Set B were treated with 300 W for 5\nmin (see Table 1). The inset photographs in (b) show prototypical examples of\nTANCSs from both Sets after mock testing where the marked central region\ndenotes the mock testing area. A distinction in the color of the central\nregion after mock testing is observed where Set B maintains a color close to\nthe original coating whilst Set A has a more evident color loss. The release\nof Cu species into the PBS droplet is influenced by the Cu solubility within\nthe coating. It is likely that the different oxygen plasma treatment supports\nthe difference in the leaching data between Set A and B TANCSs.\n\n### Optimizing the release of Cu with SiO_2 and fluorosilane capping layers\n\nIt is evident from the plot in Fig. 3a that some of the TANCSs in Table 1\nleach Cu excessively above the MIC-Cu determined to be \\\\(\\sim\\\\)2 mg/L. From\na coating longevity point of view, excessive Cu leaching is undesirable. In\ncases where [Cu] leached >> MIC-Cu, we propose that the Cu is being released\nin a burst like manor. The migration of chloride ions into the TANCS\nfacilitates the fast generation of Cu ions such that the effect of the SiO_2\nthickness is masked. To combat this and increase the longevity of the TANCS,\nwe increased both the fluorosilane concentration and the SiO_2 thickness in\norder to control the rate of Cu dissolution.\n\nThe results are presented in Fig. 4 which plots the LR from the AM test and\n[Cu] leached during the mock test vs. SiO_2 thickness and fluorosilane\nconcentration for TANCS treated with (a) 50 W and (b) 300 W oxygen plasma.\nFirst, we observe that Set A TANCSs leached up to four times more Cu than Set\nB for the same SiO_2 thickness and flurosilane concentration. The lower Cu\ndissolution rate in Set B is likely due to a higher (300 W) oxygen plasma\ntreatment that may have partially oxidized the underlying Cu, thereby reducing\nits solubility. Second, we note that all TANCSs from Set A demonstrated a\n>4-LR in the AM test irrespective of SiO_2 thickness, except with the 0.024 %\nfluorosilane coated TANCSs, where the LR and [Cu] leached scaled inversely\nwith SiO_2 thickness. The same trend was observed in Set B TANCSs, though, the\neffect of SiO_2 thickness was also observed for the lower (0.012%)\nfluorosilane concentration. It is likely that for TANCSs with high\nconcentration fluorosilane high oxygen plasma treatment (Set B), the migration\nof chloride into the TANCS is reduced and the burst release mechanism is\nsuppressed. In such a way, we demonstrate a method of controlling the Cu\ndissolution to within the optimal range above MIC-Cu. Overall, a combination\nof SiO_2 thickness, fluorosilane concentration and oxidation of the underlying\nCu is required to achieve the optimal Cu release and LR.\n\nFig. 4: Plots of LR and [Cu] leached as a function of SiO_2 thickness and\nfluorosilane concentration.\n\nTANCSs were treated with 50 W and 300 W oxygen plasma in (a) and (b)\nrespectively. Error bars represent the standard deviation of two samples. Note\nthat in some cases, the error bar is smaller than the marker and not visible.\n\nFull size image\n\nFinally, the WCA of the coatings before and after AM testing was measured. The\nETC coating imparts a contact angle >90\u00b0 and changes by less than 5% after the\nAM test. Supplementary Table 3 shows that for the selected embodiments, after\nAM testing, the change in water contact angle of the AM-tested surfaces varies\nby less than 5% from the initial contact angle value of the coating measured\nbefore testing. For other samples, the variation is as low as 3% or less than\n1%. The results of the AM testing illustrate good performance of the AM\nsurface in terms of retaining a high water contact angle.\n\n### AM durability\n\nTouchscreens are continuously exposed to various types of contact and wear.\nTherefore, durability and resistance to general wear and tear are important\nreliability features for AM coatings. Durability against wiping and cleaning,\nas prescribed by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)\nguidelines for infection control, was tested by subjecting the TANCSs to up to\n2 years of wear (see methods \u201cStipulated wear testing\u201d) and then testing their\nAM, optical and wetting properties. Identical TANCSs (each with 25 nm SiO_2\nand 0.012% fluorosilane) were fabricated. One sample was immediately AM\ntested, and the second sample was AM tested after 730 or 1200 abrasion cycles\nwith a Lysol\u00ae (sample S2) or IPA (sample S1) impregnated scouring pad on the\ncoating surface, respectively. The results are presented in Fig. 5. The raw\nwater contact angle data for samples S1 and S2 can be found in the\nSupplementary Table 4. All TANCSs demonstrated a >3-LR against S. Aureus even\nafter abrasion testing. The TANCSs also maintained their wetting and optical\ncharacteristics post-abrasion, revealing a less than 5% average gain in\ntransmission and between 10\u221215% reduction in contact angle with respect to the\ninitial value. The maintenance of the high WCA, demonstrates that the\nfluorosilane is robust topcoat that does not degrade with repeated wiping.\nOverall, the results of the abrasion test suggest that the embedded Cu DNPs\nare reasonably durable in terms of retaining AM activity, optical properties\nand high-WCA (>90\u00b0).\n\nFig. 5: Optical and abrasion-resistance properties of TANCSs.\n\na Transmission, b LR, c Haze, and d WCA of TANCSs before and after wet\nabrasion testing with IPA (1200 wipes) and Lysol\u00ae (730 wipes). The inset of\n(a) shows the TANCSs after wet abrasion testing on the central region. The\nsize of the samples is 2 \u00d7 2 in.^2 The visual appearance of the central wiping\nregion remains close in color to the outer region, indicting a good durability\nof the coating to repeated wipes with cleaning sanitizers.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this work, we have demonstrated the incorporation of Cu DNPs into a\ntransparent and AM nanostructured Cu surface (TANCS) for glass substrates. The\nTANCS demonstrated a >99.9% reduction effectiveness against S. Aureus within 2\nh, and have a color-neutral optical transmission, including the substrate,\nbetween 70\u201380% in the region 380\u2013750 nm. Moreover, the TANCSs are easy to\nclean and retain their AM efficacy, optical, and wetting properties even after\ndurability testing. In addition, they are fabricated in a way that is\nindustrially scalable. We anticipate that the proposed TANCS may be useful in\napplications of technological interest such as multi-user transparent touch\nactivated surfaces.\n\n## Data availability\n\nData generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are included in\nthis published article (and its Supplementary Information file).
