AT&T says the Turbo add-on, available starting today, is\n\"built to support high-performance mobile applications, like gaming, social\nvideo broadcasting and live video conferencing, with optimized data while\ncustomers are on the go.\"\n\nWhile Turbo \"boosts all the high-speed and hotspot data on a user's\nconnection,\" AT&T said the difference will be more noticeable for certain\nkinds of applications. For example, gaming applications using Turbo will\nexperience \"less freezing or stuttering and lower latency,\" AT&T said.\n\nThe $7 charge is for each line. Adding Turbo to multiple lines on the same\naccount requires paying the extra fee for each line. AT&T said that Turbo lets\nusers \"optimize their plan's high-speed (premium) and hotspot data allotments\"\nand provides better data performance \"even during busy times on the network.\"\n\nTurbo is only available for 5G phones on certain \"unlimited\" plans. AT&T notes\nthat \"Turbo does not provide extra data\" and that \"if you exceed your existing\nallotments your normal network management applies.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"On AT&T Unlimited Extra EL after 75GB, AT&T may temporarily slow data speeds\nif the network is busy,\" the company says. \"On each eligible plan, after you\nexceed your hotspot allotment, your hotspot speeds are slowed to a maximum of\n128Kbps.\"\n\nPeople who pay extra for Turbo might want to look at their video settings. By\ndefault, AT&T limits video streaming to DVD quality, but customers can turn on\nhigh-definition video at the expense of using more data.\n\n## Quality of service\n\nAn article by The Mobile Report said that AT&T will differentiate between\nusers who pay for Turbo and those who don't with Quality of Service Class\nIdentifiers, or QCIs. \"We're told that, basically, all eligible plans are now\nmoved to QCI 8, and get the privilege of buying their way back into QCI 7,\"\nthe article said. QCI 6 is reportedly reserved for public safety professionals\non the FirstNet service built by AT&T under a government contract.\n\nAT&T confirmed to Ars today that Turbo \"is assigned to a QCI to which some of\nour consumer traffic was previously assigned.\" But AT&T said it has\n\"materially modified it and increased network resources and relative weighting\nfor AT&T Turbo traffic, thereby creating a higher level of performance than\nwe've ever before offered to consumers.\"\n\nAT&T also said that QCIs \"are simply a number assigned to a class of service,\"\nand that the \"treatment and performance of traffic in a particular class is\naffected by a range of variables that can be tuned to provide different\nexperiences.\" AT&T said that last summer, it \"rationalized and streamlined how\nour plans are mapped to QCI levels\" and that \"these changes helped optimize\nnetwork performance for our overall customer base.\"\n\nThe current version of Turbo may be followed by other paid extras that enhance\nperformance, as AT&T called it the \"first step in modernizing and preparing\nour mobile network for future innovative use cases... Latency-sensitive\napplications will continue to need more enhanced network technologies to\nperform their best, so we plan to continue to advance and evolve AT&T Turbo.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n85\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
