He left\nto work at Google for two years before returning to Meta in February to work\non the company's Ray-Ban AI glasses.\n\nBusiness Insider verified his employment history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKinnon wrote on his personal blog that while the companies may seem similar,\nprospective candidates should know some key differences between the two, from\nwork-life balance to compensation.\n\n\"Meta and Google are both phenomenal technology companies where great PMs can\nthrive,\" McKinnon wrote, adding that if someone is looking for \"growth at the\nexpense of stress and pressure, Meta is probably a better fit.\"\n\n\"If you want to prioritize work-life balance, stability, and job security,\nGoogle could be a great place for you,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some of the differences, according to McKinnon.\n\n## Compensation\n\nMeta and Google offer product managers a salary, bonus, and restricted-stock-\nunit grants but have different pay structures, McKinnon said.\n\nMcKinnon wrote that Meta evenly distributes its RSUs over four years while\nGoogle front-loads its grants, so 70% of the stock is provided within the\nfirst two years of employment.\n\nOverall, the \"typical Google employee\" may make less each year because the\ncompany offers much smaller stock refreshers than Meta, he wrote. Some\nemployers provide stock refreshers \u2014 essentially more stock after the initial\nstock grant is provided \u2014 as an incentive for employees to stick with the\ncompany.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Refreshers at Google are significantly smaller than Meta for the same level\nand role and performance multipliers are much scarcer,\" McKinnon wrote.\n\nEmployees at Google can be rated to have a \"significant impact\" on the company\nbut receive no additional bonus or stock refresher, he said.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, a Google spokesperson disputed McKinnon's\nassertion that employees make less each year partly because they aren't\nawarded additional bonuses or stock refreshers for having a \"significant\nimpact\" rating.\n\n\"A 'Significant Impact' rating provides a generous multiplier for every\nemployee who receives it, which boosts their bonus and equity refresh above\nthe target amount. We know most Googlers are making a significant impact, and\nwe want to reward them for that,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe spokesperson also noted that the \"vast majority of Googlers received a\ncompensation increase\" in 2024, including a salary bump, equity grant, and\nbonuses.\n\nIn March, Business Insider reported Google employees received smaller\ncompensation packages this year.\n\nOne employee told BI that the stock refreshers were \"noticeably smaller than\nwhat Google has historically offered,\" while a manager said some workers saw\ntheir total compensation drop despite receiving an \"outstanding\" rating.\n\n## Project opportunities\n\nMcKinnon describes Meta and Google as \"bottom-up\" companies, where ideas\nlargely originate from small teams building prototypes and other colleagues\njoining in if the prototype gains traction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Both Gmail (Google) and Marketplace (Meta) were famously side projects that\ngrew into major components of the businesses,\" McKinnon wrote.\n\nHowever, the companies evaluate and support new ideas differently, McKinnon\nwrote, saying Meta's leadership can be enthusiastic about new projects and\npursue them \"aggressively,\" but the idea can be quickly dropped if it does not\nmeet expectations.\n\nThe product manager recalled how he worked on an audio-social project when\nClubhouse, an audio-based social-media app, was popular.\n\n\"A couple hundred friends and I got invited to see if we could make social\naudio work in Facebook Blue,\" he wrote, referring to Facebook's attempt at the\ntime to make an audio-social-app competitor. \"Less than a year later, when it\nwas clear we weren't meeting expectations, our team was blown up.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKinnon also said that Meta's leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, can\nalso intervene if they find conflicting visions among teams for a product.\n\n\"If Mark or his execs encounter two different visions for a product, they\nrequest reviews from the battling parties and make a call based on their\njudgment,\" McKinnon wrote. \"This top-down control can cut both ways, depending\non which side of the decision you're on.\"\n\nAt Google, however, teams can work on similar projects for \"literally decades\"\nwithout leadership intervening, McKinnon wrote, pointing to Maps and Waze, GPS\napps that are both owned by Google.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThis can be fruitful for product managers who want to pursue their visions for\na product with their respective teams but also \"frustrating for ambitious PMs\nwho want to build products that require larger teams,\" he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, project timelines can \"span decades\" at Google, according to\nMcKinnon.\n\nHe wrote that when he pitched an idea to a Google VP, the executive responded\nback that the idea was great but that he'd rather have employees focus on\nGoogle's search business.\n\n\"This interaction encapsulates how Google thinks about change, which is likely\ncorrect from the perspective of Google shareholders but potentially not\nappealing to prospective product managers,\" McKinnon wrote.\n\nA Google spokesperson pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's statements regarding\nAlphabet's first-quarter performance, in which the CEO explained how the\ncompany is trying to move faster by simplifying team structures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Company transparency\n\nMeta does maintain some of the transparency the company was known for in its\nearlier days, McKinnon wrote.\n\nAt Meta, McKinnon was aware of what other teams were working on, partly\nthrough the company's internal forums and dashboards.\n\nZuckerberg also still hosts the weekly Q&A sessions with his employees, taking\nquestions \"off the cuff,\" McKinnon wrote.\n\nManagers are expected to be up front in their reports about promotions and\nemployee ratings, and \"compensation is formulaic and predictable,\" he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne downside to the transparency is that employees have \"nowhere to hide,\"\nmeaning everyone knows what employees are working on, and people won't be able\nto \"take a back seat,\" McKinnon said.\n\nAt Google, employees mostly communicate through email or chat, so it's more\ndifficult to know what everyone is doing, McKinnon wrote.\n\nMcKinnon also wrote that he felt Pichai wasn't as candid with his answers to\nemployees like Zuckerberg.\n\nHe wrote that compensation is also less predictable, and feedback from\nleadership is harder to obtain at the search giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While this isn't great for those looking to learn and grow, this\norganizational style makes it much easier to let work drift into the\nbackground when other life priorities need your attention,\" he wrote.\n\nOverall, transparency has declined for both companies, McKinnon noted.\n\n## 'Expression' in the workplace\n\nAt Meta, McKinnon feels that dissent is welcomed.\n\n\"Meta feels like a quasi-academic, truth-seeking organization where decisions\nare made with data and dissent is encouraged,\" he wrote. \"This environment can\nbe quite unsettling to those used to a more consensus-based or non-\nconfrontational culture.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle is different when it comes to \"free expression,\" and employees are more\n\"reserved,\" according to McKinnon.\n\n\"Questioning priorities is generally not encouraged, which does tend to make\nfor a more collegial work environment but can be frustrating for PMs who want\nto effect change,\" he wrote.\n\nIn April, Google fired at least 28 employees for protesting the company's\nProject Nimbus, a $1.2 billion cloud-computing contract with Israel's\ngovernment.\n\n## Career ladder\n\nMcKinnon wrote that the career ladder seems faster at Meta than at Google,\nwhere progression can often be based on seniority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also said that Meta's leadership is filled with young VPs, including the\ncompany's chief financial officer, Susan Li, who assumed the role when she was\n36.\n\n\"Google is much more time-based,\" McKinnon wrote.\n\nManagers are given a quota for tenure-based promotions, and while promotions\nbased on excellent performance can happen, they are \"much rarer,\" he said.\n\nBut he added a caveat: \"However, these career progression observations cut\nboth ways. I have never been in this situation, but I believe that it is much\neasier to get fired for poor performance at Meta than Google, which should\ncertainly be a factor for those for whom job security is paramount.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## PMs versus software engineers\n\nProduct managers at Meta and Google can serve different purposes, according to\nMcKinnon.\n\nAt Google, McKinnon saw that projects were largely created and led by software\nengineers, and PMs played a more auxiliary role.\n\nAt Meta, there's a stronger emphasis on product managers who are \"responsible\nfor both ensuring the broader team is building something useful and that\nusefulness can be quantified and iterated on,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Both approaches have their merit, but I never could shake the feeling that\nGoogle could delete its entire PM function and not feel much in the way of\nrepercussions,\" McKinnon wrote.\n\nOn February 28, Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, joined 31\nother media groups and filed a $2.3 billion suit against Google in Dutch\ncourt, alleging losses suffered due to the company's advertising practices.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: Marketing leaders from Amazon, LinkedIn, Lego Group and more tell\nInsider what pandemic-fueled business changes are likely to stick around\n\nMeta Google\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.

The PowerPC 40x processors were found in thin clients, set-top boxes,\nand other devices during the 90's. Finally now it looks like that the PowerPC\n40x removal is set to happen.\n\nMichael Ellerman sent out the patch series today for removing the 40x\nprocessor support. This removes the PowerPC 401/403/405 support while leaving\nthe PowerPC 440 and later processor support. Ellerman explained in the patch\nseries:\n\n> \"The 40x platforms & CPUs are old and have been unmaintained for years, and\n> as far as we can tell have no users.\n>\n> Note 44x and 476 are not affected. ... So unless anyone steps up to maintain\n> it, remove 40x as unused. RIP.\"\n\nDropping this early PowerPC code from the Linux kernel clears out 4.4k lines\nof old and unmaintained code. We'll see if these patches get queued in time\nfor the upcoming Linux v6.10 merge window.\n\n4 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nLinux 6.10 To Drop Support For Very Old DEC Alpha Hardware\n\nFramework Laptop EC Driver Being Prepared For Linux\n\nLinux 6.10 To Support Sound On ASUS ROG 2024 Laptops, Lenovo ThinkPad 13X\n\nSynaptics Releases DisplayLink 6.0 USB Graphics Driver Package For Linux\n\nASUS ROG RAIKIRI & Lunar Lake Point M Device IDs Sent In For Linux 6.9-rc7\n\nDell Laptop Platform Profile Patches Being Worked On For Linux\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
