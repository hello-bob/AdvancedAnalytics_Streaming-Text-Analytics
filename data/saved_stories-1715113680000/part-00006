This is a\nvariation on the 1-3-1 problem-solving method (nice summary here), focused\nspecifically on proposals.\n\n## 1-measure-3-1\n\n  * 1: one problem to solve or opportunity to grasp\n  * Measure: how will we know it\u2019s solved/the opportunity is met. What metrics are we looking to shift, or outcomes are we looking to achieve?\n  * 3: three options we have considered\n  * 1: our one recommendation\n\n## Fit it onto one page\n\nIt is always best to make your proposal succinct. This applies even more when\nyou want a decision from someone senior to you, who will have many competing\ndemands on their time, a wider scope of work than you and less context on this\nparticular issue. You want to make it easy and quick for them to grasp the key\npoints.\n\nYou should always aim to cover 1-measure-3-1 on one page.\n\nDon\u2019t mess with the margins and font size, focus instead on making sure you\nare extracting the key points.\n\n## Prioritise the user: the decision-maker\n\nIf you really need to go over one page, it absolutely must fit onto two.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t fit on two pages you haven\u2019t done the work to understand what is\ncrucial for the decision to be made and you are including extraneous detail.\n\nYou are prioritising your time over the time of the person you are asking to\nmake the decision: the less time you spend making your proposal really tight,\nthe more time you are asking the decision-maker to spend reading and parsing\nyour content to draw out the key points. The impact will be that the decision\nwill take longer, and may be of a lower quality.\n\n## Put useful extra detail in appendices\n\nIt\u2019s OK to include appendices with more detail; what you put into an appendix\nis extra info that might be of interest to the decision-maker (e.g. the\nmethodology you used, where any raw data came from etc) but it should be\npossible to make the decision without reading the appendices.\n\nContinue to aim for succinctness in the appendices.\n\n[FYI, the above is one page of a Google doc. Now to the second page.]\n\n## Appendix A: useful extra detail\n\n  * If you are presenting a proposal to your exec team, include any costs, expected ROI or other relevant financial implications.\n  * The problem to solve or opportunity to grasp should briefly cover the current state and any relevant deadline or key commercial date.\n  * You can present this 1-measure-1-2, (i.e. our recommendation and then 2 other options) if that flows better.\n  * Don\u2019t get hung up on the measure \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be a hard metric. It should outline the change you expect to see in the world.\n\n## Appendix B: how to write about options\n\n  * You should always consider \u201cdo nothing\u201d as an option, i.e. no decision or action, continue as we are. You can either include this as one of the options, or if you judge that this is genuinely not a viable option here then you should describe the risk of not making a decision when you describe the problem/opportunity.\n  * It\u2019s OK to include more than 3 options if that adds value, as long as it doesn\u2019t make the document too long.\n  * Include brief pros and cons for each option.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be notified when I publish a new post, and possibly receive\noccasional announcements, sign up to my mailing list:\n\n## Archive\n\nSee all posts by date or category.\n\n### Recent posts\n\n  * 1-measure-3-1 29 April 2024\n  * Learning from a strategy project 14 January 2024\n  * Scaling People 26 November 2023\n  * Analysing, Deciding Doing: How to develop and execute an effective strategy 10 September 2023\n  * Strategic technology leadership: video 03 September 2023\n  * Strategic technology leadership: fireside chat 11 July 2023\n  * The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People 26 June 2023\n  * Software Architecture Hour with Neal Ford 20 May 2023\n  * What next for No next Next? 12 December 2022\n  * Working together on tech strategy 09 December 2022\n\nMore in the archive.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
