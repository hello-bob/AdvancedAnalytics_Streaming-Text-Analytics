Images\n\nBinance\u2019s billionaire founder Changpeng Zhao was sentenced to four months in\nprison on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to charges of enabling money\nlaundering at his crypto exchange.\n\n\u201cYou had the wherewithal, the finance capabilities, and the people power to\nmake sure that every single regulation had to be complied with, and so you\nfailed at that opportunity,\u201d U.S. District Judge Richard Jones said to Zhao in\na Seattle federal court, according to a Reuters report.\n\nThe sentence handed down to the former Binance chief was significantly less\nthan the three years that federal prosecutors had been seeking for him. The\ndefense had asked for five months of probation. The sentencing guidelines\ncalled for a prison term of 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Zhao told the judge before receiving his sentence, per Reuters.\n\n\u201cI believe the first step of taking responsibility is to fully recognize the\nmistakes,\u201d Zhao reportedly said earlier Tuesday in court. \u201cHere I failed to\nimplement an adequate anti-money laundering program... I realize now the\nseriousness of that mistake.\u201d\n\nIn November, Zhao, commonly known as CZ, struck a deal with the U.S.\ngovernment to resolve a multiyear investigation into Binance, the world\u2019s\nlargest cryptocurrency exchange. As part of the settlement, Zhao stepped down\nas the company\u2019s CEO. Though he is no longer running the company, Zhao is\nwidely reported to have an estimated 90% stake in Binance.\n\nZhao, who wore a dark navy suit with a light blue tie to court, is accused of\nwillfully failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program as\nrequired by the Bank Secrecy Act, and of allowing Binance to process\ntransactions involving proceeds of unlawful activity, including between\nAmericans and individuals in sanctions jurisdictions.\n\nThe U.S. ordered Binance to pay $4.3 billion in fines and forfeiture. Zhao\nagreed to pay a $50 million fine.\n\nBinance has separately been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the alleged\nmishandling of customer assets and the operation of an illegal, unregistered\nexchange in the U.S.\n\nThe action against Binance and its founder was a joint effort by the\nDepartment of Justice, the CFTC and the Treasury Department, though the SEC\nwas notably absent.\n\nA Binance spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC that the crypto exchange is\n\u201cproud of the culture of compliance, security, and transparency we have\ncreated over the past several years, and we look forward to building on that\nculture as we continue to evolve.\u201d\n\nChangpeng Zhao, former chief executive officer of Binance, arrives at federal\ncourt in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, April 30, 2024.\n\nDavid Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe spokesperson said the company has made \u201cconsiderable compliance\nenhancements,\u201d including with regards to anti-money laundering detection and\n\u201chiring key compliance personnel.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Zhao did not immediately respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment.\n\nProsecutors say Zhao violated U.S. law on an \u201cunprecedented scale,\u201d and that\nhe had a \u201cdeliberate disregard\u201d for Binance\u2019s legal responsibilities.\n\nIn a memorandum on Apr. 23, prosecutors said that under Zhao\u2019s control,\nBinance operated on a \u201cWild West\u201d model.\n\n\u201cZhao bet that he would not get caught, and that if he did, the consequences\nwould not be as serious as the crime,\u201d the memorandum stated. \u201cBut Zhao was\ncaught, and now the Court will decide what price Zhao should pay for his\ncrimes.\u201d\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:1102:11\n\nSam Bankman-Fried faces up to 50 years in prison at sentencing hearing\n\nWorldwide Exchange\n\nZhao has gotten off much easier than former crypto rival Sam Bankman-Fried,\nthe founder and ex-CEO of FTX.\n\nBankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for crimes connected to the\noperation of his crypto exchange. Unlike Zhao and the charges brought against\nBinance, Bankman-Fried\u2019s bankrupt exchange faced allegations of fraud and\nmisuse of customers funds.\n\nBraden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the CFTC, said that behavior is\ntypically viewed as more deceitful and financially damaging to a broader array\nof people than compliance failures.\n\n\u201cCZ\u2019s case seems to focus on regulatory and compliance failures, while SBF\u2019s\ncase hinges on direct financial misconduct and deception,\u201d continued Perry.\n\u201cCompliance failures, while serious, might be seen as a failure of oversight\nrather than active malfeasance.\u201d\n\nWATCH: New Binance CEO building robust compliance program\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:5702:57\n\nNew Binance CEO: Building a robust compliance program after an immature past\n\nSquawk on the Street\n\n## More In Crypto World\n\nwatch now\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO10:50\n\nBinance founder Changpeng Zhao faces sentencing over money laundering\nviolations: CNBC Crypto World\n\nTanaya Macheel2 hours ago\n\nwatch now\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO10:22\n\nBitcoin and ether drop as investors question the U.S. economy\u2019s strength: CNBC\nCrypto World\n\nJordan Smith\n\nBinance\u2019s billionaire founder to find out if prison time is coming \u2014 here\u2019s\nwhat lawyers are expecting\n\nMacKenzie Sigalos4 hours ago\n\nRead More\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
