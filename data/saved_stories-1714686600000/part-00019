There is a lot that needs to be unraveled and sorted out\nbefore I can formally close everything down. The most immediate impact is the\nclosure of the Bards and Sages Quarterly and ceasing publication of new\nissues.\n\nIf you are an author or artist who was previously published in an issue of the\nBards and Sages Quarterly, those issues will remain on sale until the end of\n2024. After that, all back issues will be removed from sale, and all rights\nwill revert to their respective authors.\n\nThe same is true for back issues of The Society of Misfit Stories and all of\nour anthologies. These will remain on sale through the end of the year and\nthen unpublished. At that time, all rights will revert back to their\nrespective authors and artists.\n\nI've already informed our authors that we have stand-alone publishing\ncontracts with about the decision. I will work with those authors individually\nto make sure all of their rights revert to them in a timely manner, and\nprovide them with any raw files we have of their books. They will be free to\nuse those files to either self-publish or take to another publisher if they\nwish.\n\nRegarding our RPG offerings: I own all rights to the RPG materials through\nwork-for-hire agreements. If other publishers are interested in buying the\nrights to any of our RPG products or properties, I will entertain offers.\nEmail legal@bardsandsages.com to discuss.\n\nWith that out of the way, I want to provide the reasons for this decision.\n\nAs I have noted previously, I have been struggling with mental health issues\nfor some time now. I am being treated for generalized anxiety and depression,\nand though my condition has improved, I'm still not where I feel I need to be\nto properly commit the time and effort needed to being an effective publisher.\n\nAt the end of last year, I was diagnosed with additional physical health\nissues that will require surgery and treatment. While none of them are life-\nthreatening, they are an additional weight that requires my attention.\n\nAs most people who have known me a while also realize, publishing has always\nbeen my love, but it has never been my primary income source. Like a lot of\nmicro presses, I have a proverbial \"day job,\" and that day job has become\nincreasingly more complex over the last few years.\n\nAll of these issues impacted my decision. However, I also have to confess to\nwhat may have been the final straws. AI...and authors behaving badly.\n\nI am spending four to five hours a week trudging through submissions just to\nweed out AI-generated trash. I have editorial assistants who actually read and\nreview the submissions, but I still look at every submission myself first to\nmake sure I am weeding out the obvious junk before wasting their time,\notherwise the submission response rate would take 20 months. Just over the\nweekend, I rejected twenty obviously AI generated submissions. My inbox is\nflooded with it.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon and other ebook retails are pushing full-steam ahead to\npromote AI-generated content at the expense of real authors and artists.\nPublisher who actually pay authors and artists and editors now have to compete\nwith AI-generated material churned out in bulk and sold at 99 cents. And while\nit is easy to shrug this off if you are outside the industry and claim, \"Well,\nthe cream rises to the top,\" anyone that has been around the industry long\nenough knows that what rises to the top is what Amazon's algorithms push\nthere. And the AI bots are much better at manipulating the algorithms that\nreal people.\n\nTwo to three times a month, I need to fight with Amazon over negative reviews\nthat get spammed on multiple books because an author got upset about a story\nbeing rejected. Or I get some snark response back about how my reviewers need\nbetter training, or that I am not a \"real\" editor, or something outright\nvulgar. Or I get a prank call to my phone. These sort of people have always\nlurked around the industry, so I am not unaccustomed to dealing with them. But\nit seems like they have grown more emboldened, and there seems to be this\nweird social currency tied to the bad behavior now.\n\nWith everything else I have going on right, I do not have the mental energy to\ndeal with these people.\n\nTo be clear, the majority of authors and artists I have worked with over the\ndecades have been wonderful. But the number of badly-behaving individuals, and\nthe increased level of hostility they bring to the industry, has gotten to be\ntoo much.\n\nMy goal is to have everything closed down by the end of the year. Emails to\nBards and Sages will still be active, so if you are an author or artist or\npublisher with questions, you will still be able to reach me. The Contact page\nwill get updated with this information to make it easier to communicate.\nSocial media accounts will also remain active so I can be reached through\nthose as well.\n\nTo those of you I have had the pleasure of working with over the decades,\nthank you for being a part of Bards and Sages Publishing. I am extremely proud\nof the works we produced over the years and I hope you are as well.\n\nWith Love and Respect,\n\nJulie Ann Dawson\n\n## Bards and Sages Publishing\n\n", "frontpage": false}
