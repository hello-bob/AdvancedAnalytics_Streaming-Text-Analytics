According to the press release associated with\nthe report, they made the claim that search traffic volume would fall 25% by\n2026, as AI chatbots and other virtual assistants gain in popularity.\n\nObviously we were intrigued by the prediction, as likely many of you were as\nwell. So we looked at the clickstream data surrounding traditional search vs.\nAI-assisted search, to see if there were any early indicators of this shift\ntaking place.\n\n#### A Mixed Bag of Inbound Traffic Indicators\n\nLooking at just the inbound traffic to Bing.com, Google.com, OpenAI.com and\nYahoo.com from January 2023 through the end of that calendar year, we found no\nappreciable shifts in total search volume. For instance, Google.com starts the\nyear representing 91.5% of the total traffic to these sites, and then ends the\nyear down less than a single percentage point to 90.7%.\n\nMeanwhile OpenAI.com, an early darling of the consumer-facing AI race for\nsearch volume, starts 2023 with a small bump in its traffic volume percentage\nfrom February to April, rising to as high as 3.1%, then settling back into a\nconsistent 1.1% to 1.4% of total volume.\n\nWhere we did see movement in favor of AI, however, was in the percentage of\nusers who conducted one or more searches using an AI agent during a given\nmonth.\n\nThe numbers show that OpenAI.com and Bing.com \u2014 both of whom widely promoted\ntheir AI search tools \u2014 experienced significant increases in unique user\ninterest during 2023. OpenAI.com captured a seven point bump to 17.9% of the\ntotal audience, while Bing.com had a nearly 6% lift to 15.1% of the search\naudience.\n\nYet, as impressive as these increases in users investigating AI search may\nseem, Google.com continues to dominate the majority of search volume over all.\nThere\u2019s definitely a trend toward usage of AI-assisted search, but we find\nalmost no indication that traditional search is on a path to a 25% decline.\n\n#### Signs of a Novelty Factor\n\nDelving deeper into Datos\u2019 clickstream data, we uncovered more potential\nproblems with the overall prediction.\n\nThere seem to be clear indications of a novelty factor at work. And while\nnovelty in and of itself is not a bad thing, if it isn\u2019t followed with a\nconsistent behavior change, we can\u2019t really call it a trend.\n\nTake the above Bing.com numbers for instance. If we credit the inclusion of AI\nsearch tools on the platform as the cause of the unique user bump, it would\nseemingly serve to solidify the predicted 25% drop. Yet when we consulted our\npanel data further, we found that only between 4% and 9% of users used Bing\nChat (their AI agent) in any given month during 2023. What\u2019s more, of those\nthat did use it, only two to four searches were conducted over the ensuing\nmonth.\n\nWhich brings up an even more surprising finding.\n\nWhile all of the traditional search engines had repeated searches from each\nuser over the course of a month, the AI chatbots all displayed initial\nenthusiasm, followed by a steep decline in usage.\n\nUsing the next two charts to illustrate this point, we see the average\nGoogle.com user searched with the platform repeatedly over a 120 day period.\nThis suggests a healthy segment of people are conducting a Google search\nalmost daily.\n\nIn contrast, the average visitor to OpenAI.com over the same period reveals a\nmarkedly different story. Here we see the typical user will investigate the\ntool, try it a few times and then seemingly loses interest as the search\nvolume drops off a proverbial cliff.\n\nWhile we wouldn\u2019t go so far as to claim AI search is a fad \u2014 because it\u2019s not\n\u2014 the data does hint at a potentially hidden bubble that needs to be\ninvestigated further. If anything, it may be indicating the technology would\nneed significant improvement before it could seriously challenge Google\u2019s\ndominance, and that 2026 is not nearly enough time to achieve that.\n\n#### Referrals Matter\n\nFinally, we looked at referral traffic volume. For this we turned to our\nrecently completed joint research study with SparkToro, entitled, \u201cWho Sends\nTraffic on the Web and How Much?\u201d\n\nWhile this project looked much more broadly at all traffic referrers online,\nas you can see in the graph below, it does also provide a specific look at the\ntop search providers.\n\nWhat\u2019s notable here is that in search we assume that referrals represent the\nsingle most important use of a platform. After all, there\u2019s a reason the most\npopular search from the typical start page is \u201cGoogle.\u201d Users are looking to\nnavigate to where they are going, rather than expecting immediate answers.\n\nGoogle.com, Yahoo.com and Bing.com are effective at referring traffic, showing\nreferral numbers that are commensurate with their overall volume of visits.\nHowever, OpenAI.com is clearly not.\n\nThis further feeds the conventional wisdom that AI, while good at providing\nfast answers, is terrible at referring users to where they want to go. And as\nlong as usage behavior demands a tool that gets people where they want to go\nas the primary function, AI will most likely not gain meaningful ground on\ntraditional search.\n\n#### Actions You Should Be Taking\n\nSo what\u2019s your next step?\n\nWell, even though it may seem counterintuitive to some, after conducting this\nresearch we still remain bullish on applications of AI for search. It holds\ngreat promise for marketers and we believe it will vastly improve search over\ntime. However, we also caution against rushing into over-investment in the\ntechnology.\n\nOur main suggestion is to begin with your customers\u2019 needs. Using surveys,\nfocus groups or otherwise engaging with them, uncover the types of search\noptimization that will most improve your relationship with the consumer. If\nyou find AI offers the best means of doing that, pursue it.\n\nWe also recommend that you develop a two-tiered approach to optimization.\nKnowing that AI is good for immediate answers, while traditional search is\nbetter at routing, develop a plan that accommodates both choices to account\nfor a greater swath of your audience.\n\nFinally, you can assume that search engines are already deploying AI in their\nsearch solutions, and will continue to evolve these efforts to the point it\nmay become difficult to distinguish between traditional and AI search. This\nmeans the smart play is to carefully consider whether to invest in a new\nplatform or simply wait until the right solution comes to you.\n\nHowever, just remember to take your time. Dire predictions aside, disruption\nis not imminent \u2014 which is probably good news for most of us.\n\nWant to learn more about clickstream data?\n\nBob Knorpp\n\nBob Knorpp is a NYC-based business consultant with 20 years of experience, who\nhosts the BeanCast Marketing Podcast, contributes to Ad Age, and teaches at\nNew York University.\n\nShare this article:\n\nSuggested posts\n\nRev Up Your Reddit Referral Traffic\n\nApril 2024\n\nBob Knorpp\n\nEnergizing Your AI-Driven Marketing With Clickstream Data\n\nMarch 2024\n\nBob Knorpp\n\nThe Google \u201cYear-in-Review\u201d: What We Searched For, What It Means, and What\nLies Ahead\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nStephen Kraus\n\nThe 2023 Holiday Season in Retrospect\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nStephen Kraus\n\nEmbracing the Era of Robo-Advisors: What The Future of Investing Means for You\n\nDecember 2023\n\nBob Knorpp\n\nUnlock game-changing data insights, delivered straight to your inbox.\n\n#### Contact Our Team\n\n[ninja_form id=1]\n\n#### You are successfully subscribed.\n\nThanks for subscribing to our newsletter.
