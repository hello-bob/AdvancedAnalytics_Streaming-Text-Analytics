(Image credit: NASA)\n\nNASA's interstellar explorer Voyager 1 is finally communicating with ground\ncontrol in an understandable way again. On Saturday (April 20), Voyager 1\nupdated ground control about its health status for the first time in 5 months.\nWhile the Voyager 1 spacecraft still isn't sending valid science data back to\nEarth, it is now returning usable information about the health and operating\nstatus of its onboard engineering systems.\n\nThirty-five years after its launch in 1977, Voyager 1 became the first human-\nmade object to leave the solar system and enter interstellar space. It was\nfollowed out of our cosmic quarters by its space-faring sibling, Voyager 2,\nsix years later in 2018. Voyager 2, thankfully, is still operational and\ncommunicating well with Earth.\n\nThe two spacecraft remain the only human-made objects exploring space beyond\nthe influence of the sun. However, on Nov. 14, 2023, after 11 years of\nexploring interstellar space and while sitting a staggering 15 billion miles\n(24 billion kilometers) from Earth, Voyager 1's binary code \u2014 computer\nlanguage composed of 0s and 1s that it uses to communicate with its flight\nteam at NASA \u2014 stopped making sense.\n\nRelated: We finally know why NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft stopped communicating\n\u2014 scientists are working on a fix\n\nIn March, NASA's Voyager 1 operating team sent a digital \"poke\" to the\nspacecraft, prompting its flight data subsystem (FDS) to send a full memory\nreadout back home.\n\nThis memory dump revealed to scientists and engineers that the \"glitch\" is the\nresult of a corrupted code contained on a single chip representing around 3%\nof the FDS memory. The loss of this code rendered Voyager 1's science and\nengineering data unusable.\n\nJubilant scenes as NASA's Voyager flight team hear back from the craft for the\nfirst time in five months. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nThe NASA team can't physically repair or replace this chip, of course, but\nwhat they can do is remotely place the affected code elsewhere in the FDS\nmemory. Though no single section of the memory is large enough to hold this\ncode entirely, the team can slice it into sections and store these chunks\nseparately. To do this, they will also have to adjust the relevant storage\nsections to ensure the addition of this corrupted code won't cause those areas\nto stop operating individually, or working together as a whole. In addition to\nthis, NASA staff will also have to ensure any references to the corrupted\ncode's location are updated.\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n\u2014 Voyager 2: An iconic spacecraft that's still exploring 45 years on\n\n\u2014 NASA's interstellar Voyager probes get software updates beamed from 12\nbillion miles away\n\n\u2014 NASA Voyager 2 spacecraft extends its interstellar science mission for 3\nmore years\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the team began sending the code to its new location in the\nFDS memory. This was a painstaking process, as a radio signal takes 22.5 hours\nto traverse the distance between Earth and Voyager 1, and it then takes\nanother 22.5 hours to get a signal back from the craft.\n\nBy Saturday (April 20), however, the team confirmed their modification had\nworked. For the first time in five months, the scientists were able to\ncommunicate with Voyager 1 and check its health. Over the next few weeks, the\nteam will work on adjusting the rest of the FDS software and aim to recover\nthe regions of the system that are responsible for packaging and returning\nvital science data from beyond the limits of the solar system.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!

It is what got me interested in space in the first place,\nalong with my father being in the United States Air Force Security Service.
