We propose Feedback Attention Memory (FAM), a novel Transformer\n> architecture that leverages a feedback loop to enable the network to attend\n> to its own latent representations. This design fosters the emergence of\n> working memory within the Transformer, allowing it to process indefinitely\n> long sequences. TransformerFAM requires no additional weights, enabling\n> seamless integration with pre-trained models. Our experiments show that\n> TransformerFAM significantly improves Transformer performance on long-\n> context tasks across various model sizes (1B, 8B, and 24B). These results\n> showcase the potential to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to process\n> sequences of unlimited length.\n\nComments:| 24 pages, 12 figures, 14 tables  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.09173 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.09173v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Dongseong Hwang [view email] [v1] Sun, 14 Apr 2024 07:43:45 UTC (1,801\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled TransformerFAM: Feedback attention is working\nmemory, by Dongseong Hwang and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
