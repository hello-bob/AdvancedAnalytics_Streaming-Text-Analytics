In this paper, we demonstrate the photon number path\nentanglement in the frequency domain by implementing a frequency beam splitter\nthat converts the single-photon frequency to another with 50% probability\nusing Bragg scattering four-wave mixing. The two-photon NOON state in a\nsingle-mode fiber is generated in the frequency domain, manifesting the two-\nphoton interference with two-fold enhanced resolution compared to that of\nsingle-photon interference, showing the outstanding stability of the\ninterferometer. This successful translation of quantum states in the frequency\ndomain will pave the way toward the discovery of fascinating quantum phenomena\nand scalable quantum information processing.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Interferometric imaging of amplitude and phase of spatial biphoton states\n\nArticle Open access 14 August 2023\n\n### High-throughput quantum photonic devices emitting indistinguishable\nphotons in the telecom C-band\n\nArticle Open access 18 April 2024\n\n### Highly efficient vortex generation at the nanoscale\n\nArticle 01 April 2024\n\n## Introduction\n\nPhotonic entanglement plays a crucial role in resolving fundamental questions\nin quantum mechanics and exploiting quantum information technology\u2019s merits^1.\nExtensive investigations have been conducted into entanglement in various\ndegrees of freedom, including polarization^2, path^3, orbital angular\nmomentum^4, and time-bin^5. These studies have been key in investigating\ndiverse quantum phenomena, enhancing the performance of quantum\ncommunications^6,7, protecting quantum states from environment noise^8, and\nsurpassing classical limitations in metrology^9,10,11,12.\n\nThe NOON state, denoted as \\\\(\\left|{\\rm{\\psi }}\\right\\rangle\n={\\left({\\rm{|N}}\\right\\rangle }_{1}{\\left|0\\right\\rangle\n}_{2}+{\\left|0\\right\\rangle }_{1}{\\left|{\\rm{N}}\\right\\rangle\n}_{2})/\\sqrt{2}\\\\), is commonly referred to as the photon number path\nentangled state. This state represents a superposition between N photons in\npath 1 and zero photons in path 2 and vice-versa. A distinctive feature of the\nNOON state is its N-fold enhancement in phase sensitivity, which allows it to\nsurpass the limitations of classical light measurement^9,13. This attribute\nhas made the NOON state a fundamental resource in quantum applications,\nincluding quantum lithography^10, quantum imaging^14, and quantum\nmetrology^11,15. Moreover, the unique entanglement properties of the NOON\nstate pave the way toward the exploration of diverse topics in quantum\ninformation science, such as nonlocality^16, quantum error correction^17, and\ntight-binding model^18,19.\n\nRecently, the focus on quantum states in the frequency domain has intensified\ndue to its potential for high-dimensional state extensibility, spatial single-\nmode propagation, stability, miniaturization, and compatibility with fiber\nnetworks^20,21,22,23,24. The potential benefits have spurred extensive\nresearch into a variety of techniques for photon creation and manipulation\nwithin the frequency domain^20,22,23,24,25,26. Furthermore, frequency-domain\nclassical light controls have facilitated the demonstration of complex\nphysical phenomena, including three-dimensional photonic topological\ninsulator^27 and complex long-range coupling^28,29.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate the NOON-state interference in the frequency\ndomain for the first time, which is a crucial resource in quantum optics, to\nthe best of our knowledge. A quantum frequency translation process acts like a\n50:50 beam splitter with about a 50% probability of converting a single-photon\nfrequency to another and enables the creation of the N = 2 NOON state in the\nfrequency domain using a nondegenerate photon pair. The state is subsequently\nreintroduced into the frequency beam splitter through reflection, and the\nrelative phase of the NOON state is controlled via a variable delay line. We\nobserve two-photon bunching and anti-bunching effects in the frequency domain\nagainst the relative phase, with the oscillation frequency of the NOON state\ndisplaying a twofold enhancement compared to single-photon interference.\nFurthermore, our approach ensures an extremely stable interferometer due to\nthe single-mode propagation of two-color components, even without any\nstabilization method. Consequently, our work represents a significant step\ntoward exploring novel quantum effects and facilitating new tools for quantum\ninformation processing.\n\n## Results\n\nFigure 1 illustrates our experimental diagram. The traditional NOON-state\ninterference in the spatial domain is shown in Fig. 1a. Here, 1 two\nindistinguishable single photons are simultaneously introduced into two input\nmodes of a beam splitter, yielding the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect and\ncreation of a NOON state (N = 2). 2 We can control the relative phase between\nthe two paths by sliding a mirror, and 3 the NOON state can be combined by the\nsecond beam splitter. The resultant state exhibits two-photon bunching and\nanti-bunching effects in the path modes, contingent on the relative phase. The\nbunching cycles of the NOON state (N = 2) display a twofold enhancement\ncompared to single-photon interference.\n\nFig. 1\n\nSchematic diagram. a Traditional NOON-state interference (N = 2) scheme in the\nspatial domain. b BS-FWM frequency diagram. f_xx\n(\\\\({\\rm{xx}}={\\rm{p}}1,{\\rm{p}}2,{\\rm{s}},{\\rm{i}},{\\rm{ZGVD}}\\\\)) indicates\nthe frequencies of two pump fields, signal photon, idler photon, and the zero-\ngroup-velocity dispersion (ZGVD) of a nonlinear medium, respectively. c\nSchematic diagram of a frequency beam splitter through the BS-FWM process with\ntwo pump fields, an input photon, and a target photon. FBS frequency beam\nsplitter. d Proposed NOON-state interference scheme in the frequency domain\n\nFull size image\n\nIn this study, we generate the NOON state in the frequency domain using\noptical elements that serve functions analogous to those in traditional\nmethods. We utilize frequency beam splitters based on quantum frequency\ntranslation, akin to the spatial beam splitters. The frequency translation\nmethod used in this study is BS-FWM^20,21,30, which facilitates the\nsimultaneous annihilation of an input photon and the creation of a target\nphoton, driven by two classical pump fields^31,32, as seen in Fig. 1b. From\nnow on, we denote the input and target modes as signal and idler modes,\nrespectively. The idler photon\u2019s frequency obeys the energy conservation and\nphase-matching conditions, which can be fulfilled by symmetrically placing the\nfour fields around the ZGVD frequency of the nonlinear material. The idler\nphoton\u2019s frequency is determined by\n\\\\({{f}}_{{i}}={{f}}_{{\\rm{s}}}+{{f}}_{{\\rm{p}}1}-{{f}}_{{\\rm{p}}2}\\\\), where\nf_l (\\\\(\\tt {l}={i},{s},{p}1,{p}2\\\\)) represents the frequency of the idler,\nsignal, pump1, and pump2, respectively. Vertical arrows pointing upwards\nsignify the creation process, while those pointing downwards represent the\nannihilation process. The evolution of the annihilation mode operators via BS-\nFWM is dictated by^21,31,32\n\n$${\\hat{{a}}}_{{\\rm{s}},{\\rm{out}}}=\\cos\n\\left({\\rm{gL}}\\right){\\hat{{{a}}}}_{{\\rm{s}},{\\rm{in}}}+{{\\rm{ie}}}^{{i}{\\rm{\\phi\n}}}\\sin ({\\rm{gL}}){\\hat{{{a}}}}_{{\\rm{i}},{\\rm{in}}}$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${\\hat{{{a}}}}_{{\\rm{i}},{\\rm{out}}}={{\\rm{ie}}}^{-{{i}}{\\rm{\\phi }}}\\sin\n({\\rm{gL}}){\\hat{{{a}}}}_{{\\rm{s}},{\\rm{in}}}+\\cos\n({\\rm{gL}}){\\hat{{{a}}}}_{{\\rm{i}},{\\rm{in}}}$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \\\\({\\hat{{\\rm{a}}}}_{{\\rm{m}},{\\rm{n}}}\\\\) (\\\\(\\tt\n{{m}}={{s}},{{i;n}}={\\rm{in}},{\\rm{out}}\\\\)) denotes the annihilation\noperators of signal and idler modes in the input and output modes,\nrespectively. L symbolizes the length of the nonlinear medium, and \u03c6 signifies\nthe phase difference between the two pump beams. The parameter g is defined as\n\\\\({{g}}\\equiv {{\\gamma }}{{P}}\\\\), where \u03b3 is the nonlinear coefficient and\nP_1 and P_2 are the powers of the pump beam 1 and 2, respectively. In this\nstudy, P is the total power of the two pump beams, which are set to be equal\n(\\\\({{P}}/2={{{P}}}_{1}={{{P}}}_{2}\\\\)). This ensures the attainment of the\nphase-matching condition, independent of the total pump power^31. Eqs. (1) and\n(2) equate to operators describing the functionality of a frequency beam\nsplitter. A frequency beam splitter allows frequency translation of a signal\nphoton to the desired idler frequency with a translation probability, as shown\nin Fig. 1c. For an initial insertion of a signal portion, the probability of\npersisting in the signal frequency, similar to transmittance in a spatial beam\nsplitter, is \\\\({\\rm{co}}{{\\rm{s}}}^{2}({\\rm{gL}})\\\\), while that of\ntranslating to the idler frequency, like reflectance in a spatial beam\nsplitter, is \\\\({\\rm{si}}{{\\rm{n}}}^{2}({\\rm{gL}})\\\\). Control of the\nsplitting ratio in the frequency domain is achievable by changing the BS-FWM\npump power. Consequently, the BS-FWM effect enables the implementation of\nfrequency beam splitters analogous to spatial beam splitters^21,33. In this\nwork, we have taken the frequency beam splitter a step further by creating the\nNOON state in the frequency domain, which is a significant milestone in\nquantum optics, for the first time to the best of our knowledge.\n\nOur proposed concept of NOON-state interference in the frequency domain is\nillustrated in Fig. 1d. 1 Instead of feeding two identical single photons into\nthe two input ports of a spatial beam splitter, we introduce two single\nphotons\u2014one embodying the signal frequency, the other the idler frequency\u2014into\na frequency beam splitter. Here, different frequencies entering the frequency\nbeam splitter correspond to the two input ports of the spatial beam splitter.\nA translation probability of 50% induces the HOM effect in the frequency\ndomain, and the resultant NOON state of N = 2 in the frequency domain\nsignifies the frequency two-photon bunching either in the signal frequency or\nthe idler frequency. 2 We control the relative phase of the NOON state by\nadjusting the position of the secondary frequency beam splitter as the length\ndifference between the signal and idler wavelengths causes a relative phase\nshift between them. 3 The final state, after traversing the secondary\nfrequency beam splitter, exhibits periodic two-photon bunching and anti-\nbunching effects in the frequency domain, influenced by the relative phase.\nThe bunching effect can be observed by placing a filter to separate the signal\nand idler photons. Therefore, we are able to implement the NOON-state\ninterference in the frequency domain via Bragg scattering four-wave mixing.\n\nIn the interferometer depicted in Fig. 1d, the output state after the second\nfrequency beam splitter is given by\n\n$$\\left|{{\\rm{\\psi }}}_{{\\rm{NOON}}}\\right\\rangle\n=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}{{\\rm{e}}}^{{\\rm{i}}(\\Delta {\\rm{\\phi }}+{\\rm{\\phi }})}\\sin\n\\left(\\Delta {\\rm{\\phi }}\\right){\\left|2\\right\\rangle\n}_{{\\rm{s}}}{\\left|0\\right\\rangle\n}_{{\\rm{i}}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}{{\\rm{e}}}^{{{i}}\\left(\\Delta {\\rm{\\phi\n}}-{\\rm{\\phi }}\\right)}\\sin \\left(\\Delta {\\rm{\\phi\n}}\\right){\\left|0\\right\\rangle }_{{\\rm{s}}}{\\left|2\\right\\rangle\n}_{{\\rm{i}}}-{{\\rm{e}}}^{{{i}}\\Delta {\\rm{\\phi }}}\\cos \\left(\\Delta {\\rm{\\phi\n}}\\right){\\left|1\\right\\rangle }_{{\\rm{s}}}{\\left|1\\right\\rangle\n}_{{\\rm{i}}}$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \\\\({\\left|{{N}}\\right\\rangle }_{{\\rm{m}},{\\rm{out}}}\\\\) (\\\\(\\tt\n{{m}}={{s}},{{i}}\\\\)) represents the Fock states (N-photon-number states) at\nthe output signal and idler modes, respectively. The relative phase \u0394\u03c6 is\ndefined as \\\\(\\Delta {{\\phi }}=2{{\\pi }}\\Delta {{f}}\\,{{L}}/{{c}}\\\\), where \u0394f\nis the frequency difference between the signal and idler modes (\\\\(\\Delta\n{{f}}={{{f}}}_{{\\rm{s}}}-{{{f}}}_{{\\rm{i}}}\\\\)). The parameter L represents\nthe distance between the two frequency beam splitters. This formulation\nreveals the oscillating two-photon bunching probability with a period of\n\\\\({{c}}/(2\\Delta {{f}})\\\\). In contrast, when classical light or single\nphotons are injected into the same interferometer, the oscillation period\ndoubles, becoming \\\\({\\rm{c}}/\\Delta {{f}}\\\\). Notably, while the coefficient\n\u03c6 in Eqs. (1) and (2) is necessary for the beam splitter operators, it does\nnot influence the measurement outcomes for the HOM effect, NOON-state\ninterference, or single-photon interference in the frequency domain. See\nSupplementary Information, Sec. I, for details about analytic calculations.\n\nOur experimental setup for observing NOON-state interference in the frequency\ndomain is shown in Fig. 2. Non-degenerate photon pairs are created via\nspontaneous four-wave mixing in a 200-m-long single-mode fiber (Corning,\nSMF-28). The pump laser has a center wavelength of 1269.50 nm and temporal\nduration of 0.1 ns. Details about the photon-pair generation is described in\nthe Methods section. The signal and idler photons have center wavelengths of\n1267.89 nm and 1271.11 nm, respectively, with a bandwidth of about 0.7 nm.\nAfter combining them with a combining filter (CF1), they are introduced to the\nfrequency beam splitter. The relative delay between them is controlled using a\ndelay line (DL1).\n\nFig. 2\n\nExperimental setup of the NOON-state interference. PC polarization controller,\nDL delay line, CF combining filter, CR circulator, NZDSF non-zero dispersion-\nshifted fiber, BF bandpass filter, FM Faraday mirror, P polarizer, BS beam\nsplitter, D superconducting nanowire single-photon detector\n\nFull size image\n\nThe two BS-FWM pump lasers (LASER1 and LASER2) have wavelengths of 1551.16 nm\n(193.27 THz) and 1546.36 nm (193.87 THz), yielding a translation frequency of\n600 GHz, and both of them have a repetition rate of 20 MHz and a temporal\nduration of 0.5 ns. After combining the two BS-FWM pump lasers using a\ncombining filter (CF2) and equalizing their power, they are synchronized with\nthe photon-pair generation pump electronically. The generated photon pairs and\nBS-FWM pumps are directed through a 100-m-long non-zero dispersion-shifted\nfiber (NZDSF) with a ZGVD wavelength of 1401 nm, where the BS-FWM effect with\n50% conversion efficiency serves as a frequency beam splitter, facilitating\nthe HOM effect in the frequency domain. The temporal overlaps and polarization\ndirection between the pair photons and BS-FWM pumps are optimized. After the\nfirst pass through the frequency beam splitter, the two photons possess\nidentical frequencies, either at the signal or idler frequency, creating the N\n= 2 NOON state in the frequency domain. The photon pairs and BS-FWM pumps are\nseparated by a bandpass filter (BF1) and reflected back by Faraday mirrors\n(FM1 and FM2), enabling their backward propagation through the NZDSF.\nAdditionally, we adjust the optical path length (DL2) to ensure temporal\noverlap between the pair photons and BS-FWM pumps during the backward\npropagation.\n\nThe relative phase within the NOON state is controlled by a delay line (DL2).\nNote that both signal and idler photons traverse a single-mode fiber. Given\nthe wavelength discrepancy between the signal (1267.89 nm) and idler (1271.11\nnm) photons, which is approximately 3.22 nm, a path length variation\nequivalent to the idler wavelength would generate a relative phase shift of\napproximately 0.253% between the signal and idler. A 0.5-mm path length\nvariation to DL2 corresponds to one idler wavelength of the relative phase\nshift. This path length variation is identical to a temporal change of 1.67\nps, much smaller than the pump duration of BS-FWM, guaranteeing still good\ntemporal overlap between the BS-FWM pumps and the pair photons. Under our\nexperimental conditions, where the pair photons pass the DL2 twice, a delay-\nline change of about 0.25 mm would cause one period in a classical\ninterference pattern.\n\nA circulator (CR) extracts the backward photons from the NOON-state\ninterferometer. BS-FWM pumps are initially filtered out by a combining filter\n(CF3), and any residual pumps are further suppressed by a bandpass filter\n(BF2) with a bandwidth of 16.9 nm centered at 1270 nm, achieving a rejection\nrate exceeding \u2212120 dB. The signal and idler photons are separated by\nadditional bandpass filters (BF3 and BF4), each with a bandwidth of 0.7 nm\ncentered at 1267.89 nm and 1271.11 nm, respectively. At each path, a beam\nsplitter along with two superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors\n(SNSPDs; Scontel, HED model) facilitate the post-selection of two-photon\nevents. Given that the SNSPDs are optimized for C-band photons, their\nmeasurement efficiency diminishes to around 40% in the O-band. Furthermore,\ntheir dark count rates are maintained around 100 Hz. The data is collected via\na time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC, Swabian instruments) module\nwith a coincidence window of 0.3 ns. The total transmission of the quantum\nfrequency translation setup is about 59% (\u22122.3 dB), including the\ntransmissions from the combining filter (CF3: 93%, \u22120.3 dB), NZDSF and\nbandpass filter (NZDSF and BF1: 87%, \u22120.6 dB), and noise block filter for the\nBS-FWM effect (BF2: 72%, \u22121.4 dB). Note that the intrinsic transmission from a\n100-m-long NZDSF is negligible (~99%, \u22120.05 dB).\n\nIn our study, we meticulously characterize the splitting ratios of a frequency\nbeam splitter for both the forward and backward directions. The splitting\nratio can be determined by monitoring the converted and non-converted signal\nsingle-photon counts while we isolate the idler photons. First, we ensure BS-\nFWM operates in a single direction, achieved by carefully adjusting the\noptical delay (DL2) and BS-FWM pump arrival time. The DL2 is varied by about\n4.5 ns from its optimum position for both the forward and backward BS-FWM. To\nactivate BS-FWM only in the forward direction, the pumps and signal photons\narrive at the frequency beam splitter at their first passing. Due to the\ndouble passing of the 4.5-ns delay, the photons and BS-FWM pumps are separated\nby 9.0 ns, which is 18 times longer than the BS-FWM pump duration, causing no\nBS-FWM in backward propagation. Similarly, to achieve only backward BS-FWM, we\npostpone the BS-FWM pumps electronically by 9.0 ns. Then, the pumps coincide\nwith signal photons at the frequency beam splitter at the second passing.\n\nThe measured splitting ratio in the forward and backward direction is shown in\nFig. 3. The transmittance (blue squares, T) of the splitting ratio is defined\nas the ratio between non-converted photon counts and total (converted and non-\nconverted) photon counts at each pump power. As we assume that the frequency\ntranslation occurs only between signal and idler wavelengths, the reflectance\n(red diamonds) of the splitting ratio is \\\\({{R}}=1-{{T}}\\\\). In reality, a\nsmall percentage of photons are diverted due to scattering into higher-order\nmodes, but this loss is minor and does not significantly affect the\ncalculation of the splitting ratio^30.\n\nFig. 3\n\nSplitting ratio in a frequency beam splitter for forward and backward\npropagation. The variation in splitting ratios as a function of input BS-FWM\npump power is depicted for a forward and b backward propagation. The\nexperimentally measured transmittance and reflectance are presented by blue\nsquares and red diamonds, respectively. The fitting of these data points is\nachieved through solid blue lines for transmittance and dashed red lines for\nreflectance, both of which are modeled as envelopes of sinusoidal functions\n\nFull size image\n\nHere, the background counts are measured at the signal and idler channels by\nblocking the input photons and then subtracted from the raw data when\ncalculating the splitting ratio. See Supplementary Information, Sec. II, for\ndetails on the measurement of the splitting ratio. The solid blue and dashed\nred lines represent the fitted curves of the envelopes, which exhibit a\nsinusoidal waveform. As illustrated in Fig. S1, the maximum depletion rates\nare achieved at pump powers of 10.4 W and 12.7 W for the forward and backward\ndirections, respectively. These discrepant pump powers indicate the pump power\nloss during the journey through the interferometer, which is approximately 18%\nloss (\u22120.85 dB).\n\nWe observe the maximum translation efficiencies of 85.9 \u00b1 1.6% and 81.5 \u00b1 1.5%\nfor the forward and backward directions, respectively. See Supplementary\nInformation, Sec. II, for details on the translation efficiencies. These high\nefficiencies are attributed to the dispersion property of the NZDSF, which\nconstraints the leakage to the unintended frequency bands and increases the\ntranslation efficiencies, given by the narrow phase-matching bandwidth of 1.32\nnm^31. We expect that higher translation efficiencies are available by\nengineering the dispersion property of optical fibers. Additionally, In the\nquantum frequency translation process, the generation of noise photons via\nspontaneous four-wave mixing^34 and spontaneous Raman scattering is\nnegligible. This is attributed to the separation of more than 270 nm between\nthe BS-FWM pumps and signal/idler photons. See Supplementary Information, Sec.\nII, for the measured noise counts.\n\nFigure 4 represents the net visibility of the HOM interference versus the\ninput BS-FWM pump power. Blue squares and red diamonds depict the net\nvisibilities for the forward and backward directions of BS-FWM, respectively.\nThe solid blue and dashed red lines correlate to the numerical simulations\nusing a Green-function method^30,35, modeling the effect of BS-FWM^36,37 as an\ninput-output relation. See Supplementary Information, Sec. III.A. for the\nsimulation method and Sec. IV for the frequency-domain HOM interference\nwithout accidental subtraction. The experimental results match well with the\nsimulation results.\n\nFig. 4\n\nHOM interference using the frequency beam splitter. Blue squares and red\ndiamonds represent the net visibilities for the forward and backward\ndirections of the HOM effect, respectively. The error bars are calculated from\nthe fit coefficients and confidence bounds of the HOM interference. Solid blue\nand red dashed curves are the simulation results\n\nFull size image\n\nCreating a NOON interferometer requires two 50:50 beam splitters. Due to a\nNOON-interferometer transmission of 82% (-0.85 dB) for the BS-FWM pumps, the\nHOM visibility for forwarding and backward propagation peaks at different\npowers of 5.20 W and 6.32 W, respectively, where the splitting ratio is close\nto 50%, and their maximum net (raw) visibility is 97.5 \u00b1 4.2% (90.5 \u00b1 3.8%)\nand 91.3 \u00b1 3.4% (83.9 \u00b1 3.0%), respectively, as seen in Fig. 4. As the 82%\ntransmission incurred through the NOON interferometer makes it difficult to\nobtain a 50% transmittance for both the forward and backward directions, we\nutilize an input BS-FWM power of 5.76 W, achieving a transmittance of 45% in\nthe forward direction, leading to a 60% transmittance in the backward\ndirection, where the corresponding net (raw) visibilities are 93.0 \u00b1 3.4%\n(86.5 \u00b1 3.2%) and 85.5 \u00b1 3.2% (80.2 \u00b1 2.9%), respectively. These unbalanced\nsplitting ratios will lead to non-ideal visibility in the NOON-state\ninterference.\n\nThe frequency-domain NOON-state interference and single-photon interference\npatterns are shown in Fig. 5. The NOON interference is gauged using the\nexperimental setup described in Fig. 2. Figure 5a depicts the NOON-state\ninterference, where the blue squares and red diamonds indicate the true\ncoincidence counts between the SNSPDs D1 & D2 and D3 & D4, respectively. Each\npoint is accumulated for 60 s. The solid blue and dashed red lines are the\nsimulation results, which align closely with the experimental findings. See\nSupplementary Information, Sec. III.B, for the simulation method of the\nfrequency-domain NOON-state interference. Notably, the HOM interference in\nFig. 4 and the two-fold enhanced quantum resolution in Fig. 5 is the signature\nof the generation of the 2002 state, \\\\(\\left|{{\\psi }}\\right\\rangle\n=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left({\\left|2\\right\\rangle\n}_{{\\rm{s}}}{\\left|0\\right\\rangle }_{{\\rm{i}}}+{\\left|0\\right\\rangle\n}_{{\\rm{s}}}{\\left|2\\right\\rangle }_{{\\rm{i}}}\\right)\\\\), commonly referred to\nas the photon number path entangled state. Our results demonstrate the\nachievement of super-resolution within this framework. However, it is\nimportant to note that super-sensitivity was not observed, which is\nattributable to system losses. See Supplementary Information, Sec. V for\ndetailed calculations about Fisher Information and super-sensitivity.\n\nFig. 5: Frequency-domain NOON-state interference.\n\na The true coincidence counts versus the temporal delay (DL2) for the NOON-\nstate interference (N = 2).

Two beam splitters preceding the detectors D1 and\nD3 are removed to enhance the count rates. The blue circles and red triangles\nindicate the true coincidence counts between the SNSPD D1 & D5 and D3 & D5,\nrespectively. Each data point is acquired for one second. The solid blue and\ndashed red lines are the theoretical results, which correlate closely with the\nexperimental data. See Supplementary Information, Sec. III.C for the\nsimulation method of the single-photon interference and Sec. VI for the\nmeasurement results without subtracting the accidental counts. By fitting the\noscillations with a sinusoidal function, we extracted the oscillation periods\nas 0.125 \u00b1 0.001 mm for the NOON state and 0.248 \u00b1 0.001 mm for the single-\nphoton state. Theoretically, these periods are calculated to be 0.125 mm and\n0.250 mm, respectively, derived using the relation\n\\\\({\\rm{Period}}={{c}}/(2{{N}}\\Delta {{f}})\\\\). The factor of two in this\nformula arises from the double pass of the delay line in our experiment. The\nexperimentally determined oscillation periods align well with these\ntheoretical expectations. While our current measurements focus on the\n2002-interference pattern, our experiment setup is adaptable for the\nmeasurement of the 4004-interference pattern via post-selection^9,11.\n\nFurthermore, our interferometer shows outstanding stability due to the use of\na single-mode spatial path. Two frequency modes propagate a single-mode fiber,\nand this guarantees that the phase shifts of the two frequency modes will be\nalmost identical, effectively neutralizing the phase difference between them.\nSuch attributes enable the frequency-domain interferometer with exceptional\nstability. Figure 6a illustrates the experimental results of a single-photon\ninterferometer stability test conducted over a 25-h period. The blue and red\ncurves represent the normalized coincidence counts between SNSPDs D1 & D5 and\nD3 & D5, respectively, where D5 is the heralding detector. Each data point is\naccumulated in one-minute intervals. For the first 0.5 h, we introduce a two-\ncycle of phase change by tuning the temporal delay line (DL2). Then, for the\nremainder of the test duration, this path-length variation is halted. The\ninset of Fig. 6a represents an expanded view of Fig. 6a, captured during the\nfirst hour of measurement. The measured interference patterns display\nremarkable stability. Of particular note, this experiment was performed on an\nunfloated optical table with a hundred meters of optical fibers. Moreover, the\nsetup was located under an air conditioner without any active\ntemperature/phase control or wind protection. The expected temperature\nstability of our interferometer, including the double-pass propagation of the\n100-m NZDSF and additional meters of single-mode fibers, is roughly \\\\(\\sim\n0.4\\,{\\rm{\\pi }}/^\\circ {\\rm{C}}\\\\), which is calculated as 1.4 \u00d7 10^\u2212^3\nps/nm/km/\u00b0C \u00d7 3.2 nm \u00d7 0.2 km \u00d7 2\u03c0c/1270 nm. This calculation is based on a\nchromatic dispersion thermal coefficient of 1.4 \u00d7 10^\u22123 ps/nm/km/\u00b0C, derived\nfrom measurements on a single-mode fiber at 1550 nm^38. Figure 6b represents\nthe measured temperature stability within our laboratory during the same time\nframe as our stability test. The average temperature is 20.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C\nthroughout this 25-h period. Under these conditions, the frequency-domain\ninterferometer exhibits unprecedented stability.\n\nFig. 6\n\nStability analysis of the frequency-domain NOON-state interferometer. a\nNormalized coincidence counts over 25 h-time periods using heralded signal-\nphotons.

The NOON state\u2019s relative phase is controlled by a delay line,\nresulting in two-photon interference. The resulting observations include the\ntwo-photon frequency bunching and anti-bunching effects depending on the\nrelative phase between the two frequency modes, two-fold enhancement in the\noscillation period compared to that of a single-photon interference, and\nunprecedented stability of the interferometer.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe NOON state exhibits a non-sinusoidal interference pattern, while the\nsingle-photon state shows a sinusoidal pattern. In addition, both patterns\nexhibit non-ideal visibility. The following three factors contribute to this\nnon-sinusoidal pattern and non-ideal visibility: (1) asymmetricity in the\njoint-spectral intensity, (2) dispersion effect of the NZDSF causing a walk-\noff between the two photons, and (3) unbalanced BS-FWM pump powers for forward\nand backward propagation. These three effects can be mitigated by the\nfollowing strategies: (1) Reducing the length of the nonlinear medium (SMF)\nfor the photon-pair generation to relax the phase-matching condition^34. (2)\nPlacing a dispersion compensation component to avoid the walk-off effect, such\nas a pair of gratings or an optical Bragg filter. (3) Amplifying the BS-FWM\npumps to compensate for the NOON interferometer insertion loss. See\nSupplementary Information, Sec. III, for details on these three factors\ncontributing to non-ideal visibility.\n\nIn this study, a high pump power of up to 15 W was utilized to compensate for\nthe low nonlinearity coefficient of the optical fiber. Despite this, the\ngeneration of noise photons remained negligibly low, posing no significant\nissue. In addition, this high pump power requirement significantly decreases\nwhen utilizing on-chip platforms. A demonstration in a silicon waveguide\nreveals an efficiency of 12% with the BS-FWM pump power of 1.6 mW^39.\nAdditionally, silicon nitride resonators report an efficiency of 60% with a\npump power of 60 mW^40. This subject is fascinating but not within our current\nresearch scope. It is, however, a prime candidate for our future research\nprojects.\n\nWith its scalability to high-dimensional multi-frequency states and the\npotential for miniaturization through single-mode propagation, quantum\ninformation processing in the frequency domain has attracted significant\nattention, especially in the context of quantum communications^41. As shown in\nthis study, frequency-domain quantum information processing highlights the\ncompatibility with optical fiber networks, in addition to demonstrating the\nremarkable stability of our interferometer, a crucial resource in both\nfundamental research and application^42,43,44, including quantum\ncommunications^45 and linear quantum computing^46.\n\nOwing to the excellent stability and scalability of our quantum states, our\nwork can be extended to implement high-dimensional quantum key distribution\n(QKD) through deployed fiber networks. This method enhances information\nefficiency and may extend the maximum transmission distance compared to\nconventional two-dimensional QKD systems^47. Notably, high-dimensional states\nin the frequency domain can be readily generated by inserting optical filters\nor a Fabry\u2013Perot cavity after the creation of photon pairs^41. Quantum\nsimulators can be investigated within the frequency domain, including quantum\nrandom walks^48 and Boson sampling^46. By varying the number of BS-FWM pumps\nand adjusting the relative phase and power between them, we can explore a\nvariety of quantum-circuit configurations and interesting phenomena, including\nnon-local hopping^28,29. These features may offer insights into areas not\nreadily accessible through conventional path-mode schematics. Finally, our\nNOON-state interferometer, exploiting the quantum interference across\ndifferent frequencies, is capable of measuring wavelength-dependent phase\nshifts. This feature holds the potential to implement quantum quantitative\nphase spectroscopy, which investigates the properties of organisms or cells,\nespecially those with extremely low damage thresholds^21,49.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Preparation of the photon pair\n\nA non-degenerate photon pair is created via spontaneous four-wave mixing\nwithin a 200-m-long single-mode fiber (Corning, SMF-28), mediated by a pump\nlaser under the relaxed phase-matching condition^34. The pump laser features a\ncentral wavelength of 1269.50 nm, a duration of 100 ps, and a peak power of\nabout 1 W. The laser operates at a repetition rate of 20 MHz, electronically\nsynchronized with the BS-FWM pump lasers. We employ two strategies to reduce\nthe noise photons resulting from spontaneous Raman scattering. First, we cool\nthe single-mode fiber by submerging it in liquid nitrogen, thereby reducing\nthe population of excited state phonons. Second, we attach a polarizer to the\noutput of the single-mode fiber and align the polarization direction of the\npump to that of the polarizer. This is because the polarization state of the\nphoton pair is parallel to that of the pump laser, while noise photons are\nunpolarized. The pump, signal, and idler photons are separated by bandpass\nfilters with a bandwidth of 0.7 nm and centered at 1269.50, 1267.89, and\n1271.11 nm, respectively. The setup ensures a pump rejection ratio exceeding\n120 dB. The resultant coincidence-to-accidental ratio for the photon pair is\n22.2 \u00b1 1.1.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
