The\nspacecraft is gradually orbiting closer to the Sun\u2019s surface than any before\nit \u2013 well within the orbit of Mercury. Flying into the outermost part of the\nSun's atmosphere, the corona, for the first time, Parker Solar Probe is\ncollecting measurements and images to expand our knowledge of the origin and\nevolution of solar wind. It also makes critical contributions to forecasting\nchanges in the space environment that affect life and technology on Earth.\n\n  * Parker will fly more than seven times closer to the Sun than any spacecraft.\n  * Over seven years, the spacecraft will complete 24 orbits around the Sun.\n  * At its closest approach, the spacecraft will come within about 3.9 million miles (6.2 million kilometers) of the Sun.\n\nNation| United States of America (USA)  \n---|---  \nObjective(s)| Solar Orbit  \nSpacecraft| Parker Solar Probe (Solar Probe Plus)  \nSpacecraft Mass| 1,510 pounds (685 kilograms) at launch  \nMission Design and Management| NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center / Johns\nHopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory  \nLaunch Vehicle| Delta IV-Heavy with Upper Stage  \nLaunch Date and Time| Aug. 12, 2018 / 7:31 UTC)  \nLaunch Site| Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla.  \nScientific Instruments| 1\\.

How does the\nsolar wind accelerate? What are the sources of high-energy solar particles?\n\nWe live in the Sun's atmosphere and this mission will help scientists better\nunderstand the Sun's impact on Earth. Data from Parker will be key to\nunderstanding and, perhaps, forecasting space weather. Space weather can\nchange the orbits of satellites, shorten their lifetimes, or interfere with\nonboard electronics.\n\nParker can survive the Sun's harsh conditions because cutting-edge thermal\nengineering advances protect the spacecraft during its dangerous journey.\n\nThe probe has four instrument suites designed to study magnetic fields,\nplasma, and energetic particles, and image the solar wind.\n\nThe mission is named for the late Dr. Eugene N. Parker, who pioneered our\nmodern understanding of the Sun. As a young professor at the University of\nChicago in the mid-1950s, Parker developed a mathematical theory that\npredicted the solar wind, the constant outflow of solar material from the Sun.\nThroughout his career, Parker revolutionized the field time and again,\nadvancing ideas that addressed the fundamental questions about the workings of\nour Sun and stars throughout the universe.\n\nHe died March 15, 2022, at age 94.\n\nIn 2018, Parker became the first person to witness the launch of a spacecraft\nbearing his name. NASA\u2019s Parker Solar Probe continues its mission today in\npursuit of the pioneering questions Parker first envisaged more than a half\ncentury ago.\n\n## Key Sources\n\n  * NASA's Parker Solar Probe Portal\n  * Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory: Parker Solar Probe\n\n### Eugene Parker Meets Parker\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2017, Eugene N. Parker, professor emeritus at the University of\nChicago, visited the spacecraft that bears his name: NASA\u2019s Parker Solar\nProbe. This is the first NASA mission named for a living researcher and it's\nhumanity\u2019s first mission to explore the Sun up close.\n\nRead More \u203a\n\n## Parker Solar Probe Stories\n\nExplore All Parker Solar Probe Stories\n\nArticle\n\n5 min read\n\nMultiple Spacecraft Tell the Story of One Giant Solar Storm\n\nArticle\n\n2 min read\n\nSolar Secrets Unveiled: Planetarium Program Showcases Parker Solar Probe\nDiscoveries\n\n7 min read\n\nNASA Missions Find \u2018Jetlets\u2019 Could Power the Solar Wind\n\nArticle1 year ago\n\n12 min read\n\nNASA Enters the Solar Atmosphere for the First Time, Bringing New Discoveries\n\nArticle2 years ago\n\n7 min read\n\nNASA Scientist Kelly Korreck on the Journey to the Sun, and What It Takes to\nGet There\n\nArticle2 years ago\n\nKeep Exploring\n\n## Discover More Topics From NASA\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope\n\nPerseverance Rover\n\nParker Solar Probe\n\nJuno\n\nReturn to top\n\n### The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of\nhumanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\n  * About NASA's Mission\n\nJoin Us\n\n  * Home\n  * News & Events\n  * Multimedia\n  * NASA+\n  * Missions\n  * Humans in Space\n  * Earth & Climate\n  * The Solar System\n  * The Universe\n  * Science\n  * Aeronautics\n  * Technology\n  * Learning Resources\n  * About NASA\n  * NASA en Espa\u00f1ol\n\n### Follow NASA\n\n  * More NASA Social Accounts\n  * NASA Newsletters\n\n  * Sitemap\n  * For Media\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * FOIA\n  * No FEAR Act\n  * Office of the IG\n  * Budget & Annual Reports\n  * Agency Financial Reports\n  * Contact NASA\n  * Accessibility\n\n  * Page Last Updated:\n\n6 months ago\n\n  * Page Editor:\n\nSMD Content Editors\n\n  * Responsible NASA Official for Science:\n\nDana Bolles\n\n", "frontpage": false}
