Unicorn? Narwhal? Oh, my.\n\n### Madison Dapcevich\n\n### Published Aug. 16, 2022\n\nImage Via Screengrab/Twitter\n\nAdvertisment:\n\nWith a striking horn, stout body, lengthy tail and two enormous legs, the so-\ncalled Magdeburg Unicorn has been a legend on the internet for years and has\nhaunted the scientific community for centuries.\n\nEvery few years, the fabled unicorn makes a reappearance online when people on\nsocial media use it as an opportunity to poke fun at the hilarious evolution\nof science, with some going so far as to dub it \"one of the worst fossil\nreconstructions in human history.\"\n\nThis happened again in August 2022 when a photograph of the unicorn was shared\non Twitter and Reddit, collectively receiving more than 200,000 likes.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe \"unicorn\" was, in part, a woolly rhinoceros, a now-extinct species that\nonce roamed over much of northern Eurasia, until the end of the last Ice Age.\nThe woolly rhino was described for the first time in 1769 \u2014 over a century\nafter the \"unicorn bones\" were unearthed \u2014 by naturalist Peter Simon Pallas.\n\nBefore we jump into that, we must fully understand the complicated history of\nthe Magdeburg Unicorn and exactly where its fabled saga began.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nDrawings of the Guericke-Einhorn after Valentini in 1714 (a) and after Leibniz\nin 1749 (b). Gr\u00f6ning and Brauckmann/The Beef Behind All Possible Pasts\n\n## An Enigmatic Discovery\n\nThe Magdeburg Unicorn \u2014 also known as the Magdeburger Einhorn or Guericke-\nEinhorn \u2014 was a collection of fossils unearthed in 1663 at Seweckenberge, a\nGerman steppe known to contain fossils from the ice age and beyond. What is\nnow called the Unicorn Cave is located near the the mountain town of\nQuedlinburg.\n\nPrussian scientist Otto von Geuricke, who was best known for his invention of\nthe vacuum pump, believed that the collection of fossilized bones belonged to\na unicorn. Around five years after their discovery, von Geuricke was said to\nhave reconstructed the bones into the form in which they are most often\nrepresented today.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut von Guericke's original 3D reconstruction, if there ever was one, was\nultimately lost. That's where philosopher and scientist Gottfried Leibniz\ncomes into the story.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nComposite of Guericke (left) and Leibniz (right). Public Domain\n\n## What Came First: The Drawings or the Model?\n\nLike von Guericke, Leibniz was a scientist of his time who held both\nlegitimate and fantastical theories. Some of his work was called into question\nin the 20th-century scientific literature and he has been described as a\n\"sober, cautious, interpreter, a skeptic one might say, but one who is\nprepared to concede the possibility of many strange phenomena.\"\n\nBut Leibniz also believed there was a place \"among the natural curiosities\" of\nthe world for \"fringe phenomena\" and \"various monsters\" such as talking dogs,\ngenies, prophets and, naturally, the unicorn. He also had a reputation for not\nalways being forthcoming with his views and was known to change his perception\nbased on his audience. After all, science 400 years ago was a different era of\nunderstanding and tended to lean more on the philosophical side. What we would\ncall mathematical sciences today, Leibniz referred to as the \"philosophy of\nimaginable things.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe Quedlinburg monster was described in chapter 35 of Leibniz' book\n\"Protogaea,\" which was a posthumously published treatise on earth sciences\nthat debuted in 1749. The book was the philosopher's attempt to develop \"the\nseeds of a new science called natural geography\"\u2014 unicorns included.\n\nFound within the chapter, \"Concerning the horn of the unicorn and the\nmonstrous animal dug up at Quedlinbury,\" is a brief mention of the Magdeburg\nUnicorn:\n\n> Since it has been demonstrated by Bartholin that unicorns (once one of the\n> most curious and rarest ornaments of natural history cabinets but now\n> surrendered to the people's admiration) come from fish from the Northern\n> ocean, we are allowed to think that the unicorn fossil found in our\n> countryside has the same origin.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> This skeleton was broken and extracted by pieces, because of the ignorance\n> and the carelessness of the diggers. But the horn, united with the head and\n> some ribs, as well as the backbone and some bones, were brought to the\n> abbess of the place\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe drawing published in \"Protogaea\" had originally been printed in 1704 by\nMichael Bernhard [Valentini], who drew it from notes and sketches by von\nGuericke and descriptions by Johann Mayer. One such image was reproduced by\nLeibniz and published in his 1749 book.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n3D model of the Guericke-Einhorn on display at the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde\n(Natural History Museum) in Magdeburg, Germany. Michael Buchwitz/The Beef\nBehind All Possible Pasts\n\nJust as the bones confounded 17th-century naturalists, the origination of the\nreconstruction, both in a 3D version and in print, continues to perplex\nscientists today. What came first, the drawings or the model? That is a\ncontentious question of whodunnit that is still debated in the scientific\nliterature of today, with some arguing that it was neither von Guericke nor\nLeibniz:\n\n> The author of the first report with a figure was Johannes Meyer, astronomer\n> and treasurer of the Abbes Superior of Quedlinburg; and his German text had\n> been translated by both partly in different ways (Guericke's Experimenta\n> nova, printed in 1672 and used by Leibniz; Leibniz's Protogaea, first\n> printed posthumously in 1749). Discovery, excavation, salvage and\n> reconstruction of the unicorn were ascribed to Guericke only by Othenio Abel\n> (for the first time in 1918 and thereafter on many occasions) without\n> indicating any source for that. His story of the supposed discovery since\n> then has been embellished with a lot of imagination further and further.\n> However, Leibniz himself wrote in his Protogaea, that a figure of the\n> unicorn skeleton (which Guericke does not reproduce) had been sent to him\n> together with a report (by J. Meyer from Quedlinburg); and this figure he\n> and his engraver Nicholas Seel\u00e4nder 'corrected' and completed in accordance\n> with their own imagination of a unicorn's build in 1716 to illustrate the\n> Protogaea (M. B. Valentini printed a copy of Meyer's original in 1704).\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n## A Puzzling Chimera\n\nScientists do have a better idea of what exactly the unicorn was made up of.\nThough many news publications have reported that it was the misaligned remains\nof a woolly rhinoceros, these claims are only half-true \u2014 and may never be\nconclusively confirmed.\n\nToday, the unicorn is housed at the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde in Magdeburg,\nGerman. One theory is that the unicorn was likely first reconstructed as a\nchimera of many different fossils. Thijs van Kolfschoten, a professor of\nmammalian paleo- and archaeozoology at Leiden University, published the below\ndescription:\n\n> The horn is most probably the \"tusk\" from a narwhale (Monodon monoceros), a\n> medium-sized whale that lives in the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada,\n> and Russia. The left upper canine of the narwhale males form a spirally\n> twisted, long tusk with a length up to more than 3 m. The skull of the\n> unicorn looks like a fossil skull of a Woolly rhinoceros and the shoulder\n> blades and the bones of the two front legs are from the extinct Woolly\n> mammoth.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe original species to which the other bones belong is as uncertain and\nintriguing as the rest of the mysterious creature's history.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nReconstruction of a woolly rhino.
