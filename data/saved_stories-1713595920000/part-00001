In\nthat case the arc length is given by a hypergeometric function, and finding\nthe asymptotic behavior for large T requires evaluating a hypergeometric\nfunction at a large argument.\n\nHere\u2019s an example with n = 3.\n\nNow the arms are not equally spaced but instead grow closer together.\n\n## Arc length\n\nAccording to MathWorld, the length of the spiral with n > 1 and \u03b8 running from\n0 to T is given by\n\nAs I discussed here, the power series defining a hypergeometric function _2F_1\ndiverges for arguments outside the unit disk, but the function can be extended\nby analytic continuation using the identity\n\n## Asymptotics\n\nMost of the terms above will drop out in the limit as z = \u2212n2T2 gets large.\nThe 1/z terms go to zero, and hypergeometric functions equal 1 when z = 0, and\nso the F terms on the right hand side above go to 1 as T increases.\n\nIn our application the hypergeometric parameters are a = \u22121/2, b = 1/2n, and c\n= 1 + 1/2n. The term\n\n(\u2212z)^\u2212a = (\u2212z)^1/2\n\nmatters, but the term\n\n(\u2212z)^\u2212b = (\u2212z)^\u22121/2n\n\ngoes to zero and can be ignored.\n\nWe find that\n\nL \u2248 k T^1 + 1/n\n\nwhere the constant k is given by\n\nk = bn \u0393(1 + 1/2n) \u0393(1/2 + 1/2n) / \u0393(1/2n) \u0393(3/2 + 1/2n)\n\nWhen n = 1, this reduces to L \u2248 1\u20442 bT2 as before.\n\n[1] The relative approximation error decreases approximately quadratically in\nT. But the absolute error grows algorithmically.\n\nCategories : Math\n\nBookmark the permalink\n\n### Leave a Reply\n\nJohn D.
