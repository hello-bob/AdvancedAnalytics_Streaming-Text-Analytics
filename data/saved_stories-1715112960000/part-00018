For those\nof you who are not, I hope you will forgive the intrusion. Maybe you'll find\nmy opinions on the topic interesting anyway.\n\nI am coming off of a period of intense involvement in an ill-fated government\ncommission, and I wanted to find another way to meaningfully contribute to the\ngovernance of something I care about. Auspiciously, the newly constituted\nMatrix foundation is forming a governing board. I am up for one of the\nindividual member seats.\n\n# Why do I care?\n\nInstant messaging is a fascinating case study in the history of technology. It\nis nearly as old as networked computing, and you could make a decent argument\nthat it is older, running only into dithering around the definitions. We've\nalways wanted to communicate, and text has always been an obvious option. It\nis probably because of the obviousness of instant messaging that it has\nrepeatedly been coopted by commercial interests.\n\nYou don't have to be very old to have lived through several iterations of this\nprocess. I'm not quite the right person to remember ICQ fondly; for me it was\nAIM. But what I remember most fondly is more obscure: XFire. It had an in-game\noverlay and killcounter integration, both critical features for my computer\nhabits that consisted heavily of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. That isn't\nactually important, I'm just reminiscing, but I think most people have a story\nlike this.\n\nIf you have read much of my back catalog you know that I am not always\noptimistic about federated systems. They face a lot of challenges, which range\nfrom the technical complexity of changing federated protocol specifications to\na whole category of opposing forces that can be vaguely chalked up as\ncapitalism. And yet, textual communications bring us what is probably\nfederation's greatest and most enduring success: email. Email is also a\ncautionary tale in a lot of ways, but it gives us a cause for optimism.\n\nThe history of federated messaging is rather more varied. XMPP was, in its\nheyday, nearly on track to mass adoption. High quality clients emerged, XMPP\nwas adopted by grassroots projects and then, as at least an implementation\ndetail, by Facebook and Google. We all know what happened. I think most people\ntoday are too quick to blame XMPP's downfall on inconsistent implementation of\nprotocol extensions (XEPs) rather than complete cooption by two of the era's\nlargest internet companies, but to be clear, inconsistent implementation was\nindeed a problem.\n\n# Matrix and Me\n\nI have used Matrix as my main, day-to-day messaging solution since 2016. I\nhave also operated a homeserver with open registration for that entire span.\nIn some ways this has been a rather passive venture, but as the user count of\nthat homeserver has grown I've struggled more with performance and moderation\nissues. A few months ago things tipped over and I had to spend a weekend doing\nsome serious work on both fronts. This lead me to pay a lot more attention to\nthe Matrix project and the state of the art.\n\nI wish that I had been more involved in the Matrix project to date, but I try\nvery hard to avoid software engineering, and Matrix governance and community\nefforts, the area that matters to me most, have often been hard for me to\nfollow. This situation has improved significantly recently, and I think that\nthe Matrix foundation deserves enormous credit for the work they have done to\npick up the level of community engagement.\n\nOf course I come to the topic with some opinions. Who would expect anything\nless?\n\n# Polish over Features\n\nThe Matrix project, especially as personified by Element, has added a huge\nnumber of new features. It's hard to call this a bad thing, and some of them\nhave been notable successes. For example, E2E is a challenging feature to\ndeliver, but has indeed become table stakes for a messaging product that\nattracts a privacy-minded userbase.\n\nStill, there is one criticism of Matrix that has remained constant over its\nentire lifespan, and its one that needs to be attended to: the level of\nconsistency, usability, and polish.\n\nPolish is tricky in a federated system. It's more the domain of clients than\nthe protocol, but the protocol directly affects the situation by determining\nhow easy it is to develop and maintain high-quality clients. For many years it\nwas clear that the change rate in the Matrix protocol made it difficult to\ndevelop a good client. Element often felt like the only complete client, and\neven it was pretty rocky. Fortunately there has been a lot of progress;\nElement has greatly improved and the stable of third-party clients like my own\nchoice, Nheko, has a lot to offer.\n\nStill, there's a lot of progress to be made. Matrix competes directly with\ncommercial products that come from vendors with a heavy focus on usability and\nuser experience. It only takes one instance of the dreaded \"Unable to decrypt\"\nfor casual users to bounce. Element continues to be a de facto \"primary\"\nimplementation that can make the road more difficult for others.\n\nI think that protocol changes should be evaluated conservatively, with an eye\ntowards providing a level of stability that enables multiple top-tier clients.\nThe Matrix Foundation should actively seek ways to support the enhancement and\nmaintenance of clients beyond Element, supporting the healthy ecosystem of\nindependent implementations that are required for an open protocol to be\nsustainable.\n\n# Moderation\n\nModeration is one of the great struggles of the internet, if not the greatest.\nSome advocates of federated systems opine that they make moderation easier or\nmore tractable. I disagree; while federation enables more flexibility in how\nusers experience moderation it makes many of the underlying problems more\ndifficult. Moderation decisions across the system are made in an ad-hoc,\ndistributed way. The rich network of homeservers presents many opportunities\nfor bad actors, including every poorly maintained (or unmaintained) node.\n\nMatrix imposes a moderation challenge at two levels: within communities and\nwithin homeservers. Relatively good tools exist at the community level, but\nstill, too many basic functions require introducing the Mjolnir moderation\nbot. At the level of the homeserver, moderation tools are frustratingly\nlimited. The administration API is minimal in severely limiting ways and there\ndo not appear to be any complete implementations of a client for it.\n\nI applaud the various efforts that have popped up, things like the community\nmoderation initiative's blocklist effort and the \"awesome technologies\"\nSynapse administration tool. But we need more, and we need more in two ways.\n\nFirst, we need technical progress. The in-protocol moderation capabilities of\nMatrix should be improved over time with a north-star vision of eliminating\nMjolnir, an approach to community moderation that was carried over from IRC\nbut probably should have stayed there. The Synapse admin API should be\nimproved and better tooling around it developed.\n\nSecond, we need progress in governance. I would like to see an open initiative\nto develop best practices for moderation of communities and homeservers. This\ncan include the development of shared blocklists through a documented,\nauditable process (although not necessarily an open one, for reasons of user\nprivacy). I would like to see a sincere effort to advance the state of the art\nin distributed moderation, bringing together diverse users to learn their\nconcern and developing tools to make consistent and active moderation the\ndefault.\n\nThe number of independently operated homeservers in Matrix can be a strength,\nbut in this area it can be a weakness. ActivityPub, with its heavier\norientation towards public discussion, has served as a laboratory for abuse\nand moderation issues. Matrix could learn a lot from the efforts going on in\nthe Mastodon community, for example, towards practical means of moderating\nacross instances.\n\nFor homeserver operators, moderation is an immense practical concern due to\nrisks from load and CSAM. The volume of CSAM traffic on Matrix, while not a\nproblem beyond solving, seems badly under-discussed and particularly calls for\nsome sort of distributed moderation program to relieve public homeserver\noperators of ongoing whac-a-mole. Sometimes a graph is only as strong as its\nweakest node---this is the kind of hard problem we have to take on to build a\nsustainable future for federated systems, and we should take it on\nenthusiastically.\n\nI would like to see the Matrix project boldly take on moderation at multiple\nlevels. First, improving the moderation tools and capabilities of the Matrix\nprotocol should always be part of the discussion. Second, I would like to see\nthe Matrix Foundation support the development of improved moderation and abuse\ntools, preferably including them as part of Synapse or providing a very easy\nsetup process so that good abuse management can be the norm rather than the\nexception. Third, I would like the Matrix foundation to facilitate community\ndiscussion around best practices, tools, and techniques for moderation.\n\nNot everyone will agree on the way to perform moderation, or even the goals of\nmoderation. That's the nature of the internet, and more broadly of\ncommunications. We can't let it stop us from trying. This can be one of the\nhardest areas to build consensus, but that will always be the case, and so we\nneed to include the inherent social complexity of moderation as part of the\ntechnical requirements. Once again: we need to be bold and take on the hard\nproblems, and this might be the hardest.\n\n# Chat, First and Mostly\n\nOne of the concerning trends I have seen in a lot of adjacent nonprofit tech\nprojects lately is dilution of mission. We could also call this\n\"distractions.\" Unfortunately, Matrix has not been immune. The most obvious\nexample is Third Room, the Matrix metaverse project. I want to temper my\ncriticism by saying that the level of effort devoted to Third Room has\nevidently been low, but I think that the optical problem created by Third Room\n(the appearance that Matrix has been capered, one might even say Zuck'd, into\na distracting focus on the latest trend) is certainly real. For a community\nventure, appearances are important, and this means applying discipline in how\nside projects are presented, especially in this era of so many projects\npresaging their downfall with some buzzword-reaction initiative.\n\nI might go just a bit further. I don't think that the VoIP features of Matrix\n(voice and video communications) are a bad idea per se, but I think that\nthat's a complex problem space and the current landscape of instant messaging\nproducts suggests that it's not a particularly important one. In other words,\npeople seem happy to do their voice/video chat in a different product than\ntheir text chat. You could say that this presents an opportunity for Matrix:\nto double down on providing a best-in-class textual messaging experience,\nwithout having to expend significant resources on real-time media.\n\nI wouldn't want to see existing features removed, but I think that features\nother than core instant messaging should be deprioritized, at least in the\nshort term.\n\n# Onboarding\n\nSometimes caring a lot about onboarding can be kind of gross. It has the scent\nof focusing on conversions. But it's a really important issue for IM, when the\nonbarding experience of a lot of the other options is \"you already have it.\"\nThe Matrix Foundation is well-positioned to demonstrate leadership in the\nonbaording experience, across the protocol, clients, and public\ncommunications. Let's make Matrix easy to get into.\n\n# A Consistent Direction\n\nI don't want to dwell too long on how many times a certain prominent Matrix\nclient has been renamed, launched new App Store listings, etc. It's old news\nand fortunately things seem to have settled down. Still, I think a lot of\nreputational damage happened that has not fully been forgotten. This history\nserves as a reminder that significant user-facing changes need to be made\ncarefully. New social applications in general, and especially federated ones,\nhave a bad reputation for churn. The most successful are often the most\nboring. Let's think carefully about things, and look before we leap.\n\n# What Do You Think?\n\nI have a lot of opinions and of course all of them are correct, but usually\nonly in my eccentric construction of reality. Your experience may vary. Please\nfeel free to reach out with your thought on the Matrix project, an offer that\nstands whether I'm elected or not, because I love to talk about it.\n\nAnd that concludes my stump speech. I'll be back again soon with a normal post\nabout some useless trivia. I think it might be about a specific kind of\nprinter that you've probably seen but not thought much about, other than\nslight irritation. I'm also spending some time right now playing video\ngames^w^w^w working on a more ambitious writing project that is out of my\nnormal lane but you might still enjoy. It's about dogs. It's also very sad and\nI'm not entirely sure what to think about it. You'll see what I mean if I ever\nfinish.\n\n    \n    \n    sincerely, j. b. crawford me@computer.rip Discuss this, complain, etc: #computer.rip:waffle.tech on Matrix Me, elsewhere: Mastodon, Cohost, Pixelfed, YouTube This website is begrudgingly generated by the use of software.
