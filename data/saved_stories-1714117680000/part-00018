This is also the same\nfor our sister companies\u2019 Ameritron, Hygain, Cushcraft, Mirage and\nVectronics.Times have changed since I started this business 52 years ago. Our\nproduct line grew and grew and prospered. Covid changed everything in\nbusinesses including ours. It was the hardest hit that we have ever had and we\nnever fully recovered.I turned 80 this year. I had never really considered\nretirement but life is so short and my time with my family is so precious.I\nwant to thank all of our employees who have helped build this company with me\nover the years. We have many employees who have made MFJ their career for 10,\n20, 30, 40 and more years.We are going to continue to sell MFJ products past\nMay 17, 2024. We have a lot of stock on hand. We will continue to offer repair\nservice work for out-of-warranty and in-warranty units for the foreseeable\nfuture.Finally, a special thanks to all of our customers and our dealers who\nhave made MFJ a worldwide name and a profitable business for so many years.\nYou all are so much appreciated.Sincerely Yours, 73sMartin F. Jue, K5FLU  \n---  \n| | | Copyright \u00a9 *2024* *MFJ Enterprises, Inc.*, All rights reserved.
