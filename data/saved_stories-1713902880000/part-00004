One of them\npointed a handgun at the teller, demanding cash. The teller, shaking with\nfear, handed over some money. The robbers ran out.\n\nUnlike most bank robbers, Johnson and Wheeler made no attempt to disguise\nthemselves, nor to obscure their faces with masks. They looked straight into\nsecurity cameras. This was particularly puzzling because Wheeler, five foot\nsix and 270 pounds, had an easily identifiable physique\u2014and a distinct face.\nSure enough, his conspicuousness doomed him. The local news flashed a photo of\nWheeler on the 11 o\u2019clock news. An hour later, after tip-offs flooded in,\nWheeler was arrested.\n\n\u201cBut I wore the lemon juice. I wore the lemon juice,\u201d Wheeler protested as he\nwas taken into custody. When the cops showed him surveillance footage in which\nhe\u2019s clearly visible robbing the bank, Wheeler\u2019s face contorted in disbelief.\nSomething in his ingenious plan, he realized, had gone very wrong.\n\nSomehow\u2014perhaps due to its relation with disappearing ink\u2014Wheeler believed\nthat lemon juice could make human faces invisible to security cameras. So,\neven though it made his eyes sting, Wheeler slathered on the juice.\n\nBut Wheeler was no sheep-like simpleton. He wisely tested the efficacy of the\njuice before the robbery. He squirted it on his face, then attempted to take a\nphoto of himself with a Polaroid camera. When the image came out, Wheeler was\nastonished: he wasn\u2019t in the shot. Convinced by his rigorous scientific\nexperiment, he proceeded to rob the bank, protected by the magic juice. (It\u2019s\nlikely Wheeler pointed the Polaroid camera in the wrong direction and just\ndidn\u2019t realize it).1\n\nThis story, which inspired the research into what we now know as the Dunning-\nKruger Effect, is a testament to the extraordinary power of human stupidity.\n\nSadly, so much of our discourse around intelligence and stupidity gets\nhijacked by pseudoscience, racism, and debates over whether arbitrary\nmeasurements like IQ are valid. We ignore more interesting questions around\nintelligence and stupidity that we can learn not from ourselves, but from\nother species. In particular:\n\n  1. What, specifically, does it mean to be \u201cintelligent?\u201d What do we mean when we say that humans and chimps and dolphins and crows are intelligent?\n\n  2. Why did some species\u2014including us\u2014become smart, while others didn\u2019t?\n\n  3. Why is stupidity still so widespread in humans?\n\nPondering these questions requires going on a bit of a wild ride, exploring\nfascinating animal worlds from chimpanzees to cephalopods, as we begin to\nunderstand our own cleverness\u2014and stupidity\u2014through the eyes of an octopus,\nthe closest thing to alien intelligence on Earth.2\n\n###\n\nII: Chimpanzees, Rubik\u2019s cubes, and disappearing ink\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite common for people [scientists] to talk about intelligence. It\u2019s\nless common for people to talk about stupidity, though, arguably, it\u2019s more\ncommon.\u201d So observes David Krakauer, evolutionary biologist, genius polymath,\nand president of the world hub of complex systems research, the Santa Fe\nInstitute.\n\nKrakauer has devoted himself to the study of stupidity. In the process, he has\nmade a series of illuminating arguments about how to consider cross-species\nintelligence, since IQ tests aren\u2019t an effective tool to determine whether an\nelephant is smarter than a crow.\n\nKrakauer points out that humans and chimpanzees share nearly 99 percent of our\ngenetic code. \u201cImagine I gave you Hamlet,\u201d Krakauer says, \u201cand I changed less\nthan 1 percent of the text and I said, \u2018What\u2019s the play?\u2019 and you said, \u2018It\u2019s\nHamlet.\u2019 And I said, \u2018What have I changed?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not quite sure...I did see a\nfew typos.\u2019\u201d\n\nLike a few typos in Hamlet, we are divided from chimps by tiny, almost\nimperceptible variations. So, how can there be this massive chasm in\nbehavioral intelligence and complexity between chimps and humans with such\nsmall divergences in genetics? It\u2019s an enduring puzzle; we still don\u2019t have\nthe answers.\n\nBut Krakauer distances himself from what he sees as unhelpful debates around\nIQ and instead focuses on more general ideas around intelligence, ignorance,\nand stupidity. His definitions have the advantage of applying across diverse\nspecies.\n\n  * Ignorance is a lack of relevant data; you don\u2019t have the information necessary to solve a problem. It\u2019s about a gap of information, not limited cognition.\n\n  * Intelligence is when one can derive simple solutions to complex problems\u2014and make it look effortless. With intelligence, more relevant information helps you solve a problem faster. Intelligence means you will solve a problem at a rate significantly faster than by trying solutions at random.\n\n  * Stupidity is when you use a rule, or a system of thought, in which adding more data or information doesn\u2019t make it any more likely that you\u2019ll get the correct answer. In the extremes of stupidity, one would solve a problem more slowly than if that creature just tried solutions derived from random chance.\n\nTo illustrate these points more precisely, Krakauer draws on the example of a\nRubik\u2019s cube. There are 43 quintillion possible arrangements of the cube. If\nyou were immortal and randomly moved bits of the cube, eventually, you\u2019d solve\nit\u2014but it would take a ridiculously long time\u2014billions upon billions of years.\n\nA stupid solution would be to simply keep rotating the same face, over and\nover, even if someone came along and gave you instructions on how to solve it.\nWith that stubbornly stupid strategy, you\u2019d never solve the puzzle.\n\nThe intelligent solution lies at the other extreme: the Rubik\u2019s cube world\nrecord currently stands at 3.13 seconds, set in July 2023.\n\nHowever, the record-holder, 23 year-old Max Park, didn\u2019t discover the insights\nthat allowed him to solve the Rubik\u2019s cube. His success was built atop a\nfoundation of accumulated knowledge that mathematicians and puzzle enthusiasts\nderived\u2014mental algorithms that enable \u201ccubers\u201d to solve the puzzle with\nlightning speed.\n\nCollectively, humans have produced an extremely intelligent solution to a\ncomplex problem\u2014and it\u2019s trillions of times faster than trying random\nsolutions.\n\nThis is one of the unique tricks that has allowed humans to collectively\nbecome the world\u2019s smartest species. Krakauer refers to this secret weapon as\nexbodiment, the transfer of knowledge from our brains to external repositories\nand tools, which can be shared, iteratively improved, and transferred across\nspace and time.\n\n\u201cMost of what happens cognitively doesn\u2019t happen in here [our brains], but out\nthere,\u201d Krakauer explains, \u201cstored in the world\u2014in books, in folklore, in\nsymphonies and so forth.\u201d\n\nWe, today, can still gain intelligence from reading Aristotle or Lao Tzu,\nwhereas chimpanzees and octopuses only learn from those who are currently\nalive.3\n\nThis, Krakauer argues, is the critical difference between us and our primate\ncousins. The ability to accumulate intelligence through cultural transfers is\nlikely the crucial tipping point, or phase transition, that explains how tiny\ngenetic fluctuations could express themselves in wildly different levels of\ncomplex cognition. As Krakauer explains:\n\n> Imagine that I gave you an ink that was very volatile, such that when you\n> wrote down text you could only transmit it to at most one other individual,\n> and once those people had it\u2014and tried to propagate it\u2014the message will have\n> disappeared.\n>\n> If we lived in such a world there would be no culture; because we couldn\u2019t\n> transmit across many generations what we had learned in our lifetime. So\n> just by changing the chemical constituents of the ink\u2014one little chemical\n> change\u2014you make the difference between no culture and a culture. And I think\n> that\u2019s what we have to look for. There\u2019s something about the capability of\n> humans to integrate over time what they have acquired and incrementally, and\n> collectively, add to culture.\n\nThis logic neatly resolves the paradox of tiny genetic markers producing\nenormous shifts in cognitive complexity. Of course, the disappearing ink is a\nthought experiment\u2014not a literal scientific solution. But it helps provide a\nframework for understanding how little tweaks, evolutionary flukes if you\nwill, can unlock profound improvements in intelligence. In our complex, non-\nlinear world, small changes often produce big effects.\n\nBut even if we accept that logic, there\u2019s a deeper, lingering question: why\nare some species smart and others...not so much?\n\n###\n\nIII: Cephalopods and the evolution of alien intelligence\n\nIn 2008, researchers at a German aquarium grew perplexed: each morning, when\nthey came into work, they found the electricity shut off. With the power\nshorted out, the filtration pumps turned off, imperiling other animals.\nFinally, a few researchers volunteered to stay overnight\u2014to figure out what\nwas going on.\n\nTo their astonishment, they found the culprit: an octopus named Otto, who was\nclimbing to the rim of his tank and shooting jets of water at an overhead\nlight that was annoying him. He had figured out that several squirts would\ncause the light to switch off, short-circuiting the electricity in the\nprocess. (A similar behavior was observed at the University of Otago in New\nZealand, and it was so expensive that they eventually just released the\noctopus back into the sea).\n\nOne intrepid octopus named Inky even managed to permanently escape from his\ntank. When researchers found he had disappeared, they discovered tracks,\nshowing he walked eight feet across the floor, entered a drainpipe only six\ninches wide, and proceeded 164 feet to oceanic freedom. (Octopuses4 have soft\nbodies, so their only limiting factor is their hard beak. They can squeeze\nthrough even the smallest cracks. If you haven\u2019t seen this video, watch it).\n\nIt\u2019s plausible that Otto\u2019s great escape was the culmination of several\nreconnaissance missions: at a UK aquarium, one octopus was caught escaping on\na nightly basis, exploring to snatch prey from other tanks, then returning\nback to his own lair, a cephalopod caper worthy of an Arthur Conan Doyle\ntitle: The Case of the Disappearing Fish.\n\nOctopuses also seem to take a like or dislike to individual humans, with one\nfeisty octopus squirting water at a particular researcher, but nobody else.\nEven when researchers wore identical uniforms, the octopus could recognize\ndifferent faces.\n\nThese behaviors are evidence of complex cognition, an advanced level of\nintelligence few creatures on Earth possess. But what\u2019s most intriguing about\noctopuses is that they\u2019re so unlike us\u2014and unlike everything else that\u2019s\nevolved to be a hyper-intelligent species. Other than coleoid cephalopods\n(octopus, squid, and cuttlefish), all animals with advanced intelligence are\nvertebrates, from corvids (crows and jays); to cetaceans (whales, dolphins,\nand porpoises); to primates like ourselves. And birds, great apes, and\ndolphins are broadly on the same evolutionary lineage, with reasonably similar\nbrain architectures.5\n\nCephalopods are the only supremely intelligent creatures on the planet that\nhave emerged from the separate evolutionary limb of invertebrates (cold-\nblooded animals with no backbone that comprise 95 percent of animal species on\nEarth). But what\u2019s particularly remarkable is how distantly we separated from\nthe octopuses and squid and cuttlefish on the tree of life.\n\nOur last common ancestor was probably a worm-like creature something like 550\nmillion years ago. The mystery of how octopuses evolved complex cognition\ndeepens when we consider that their closest ancestors are species like slugs,\nsnails, oysters, and clams\u2014hardly the kinds of animals we\u2019d choose to invite\nalong to help us win a pub quiz.\n\nWith such a distant common relative, it\u2019s no surprise an octopus would be\nquite unlike ourselves. But the divergences in their brains go well beyond the\nweird and into the territory of alien-like. An octopus arguably has not one\nbrain, but nine, a hub in its mantle (what we think of as the head) and then\neight brains the reside in each of its arms. Approximately three-fifths of the\nroughly 500 million neurons in an octopus are housed in its arms.6\n\nEven more bizarre, a severed octopus arm can behave similarly whether or not\nit is attached to the body. For over an hour, the detached arm will still\nsearch for food and try to feed a mouth that\u2019s no longer there.7 When the rest\nof the body of the octopus encounters its own severed arm, it will recognize\nit as itself\u2014whereas if it\u2019s presented with any other octopus arm, it will\nrealize it is not part of itself. This has raised the possibility that\noctopuses have several separate hubs of consciousness housed in one body, a\nprofoundly spooky idea that resonates with humans from split-brain\nexperiments.\n\nOctopus camouflage\u2014and that of cuttlefish\u2014is so magical that it\u2019s difficult to\nbelieve. And using a special trick from a part of their anatomy known as\nphotophores, many cephalopods can even emit light in a technique known as\ncounter-illumination, matching the exact light intensity of the stars or\nmoonlight from the sky above the ocean, so they won\u2019t cast a conspicuous\nsilhouette that a predator could see from below.\n\nBut my favorite cephalopod behaviors are their unique form of sexual mimicry,\nin which males of a species of cuttlefish are able to make the top of its body\nlook sexy and masculine, while making the bottom of its body mimic the\nappearance of a female. That way, its potential mate will see the enticing\nbits, while a rival male looking up from below will think it\u2019s just two\nfemales hanging out and won\u2019t interfere. Similarly, when a lady of the\nopalescent squid variety (Doryteuthis opalescens) wants to rid herself of a\npestering male, she\u2019s able to flash a white stripe down her body that appears\nto be the testes of a male squid\u2014an extreme, clever form of sexual rejection.\n(Quite an escalation from a woman at a bar giving out a fake phone number).\n\nMany of those examples are evolved traits of strange bodies, not necessarily\nevidence of advanced cognition. But octopuses are absurdly smart, embodying\nthe Krakauer definition with elegance, as they solve complex problems but make\nit look easy. They use tools: one has been filmed carrying coconut shells, an\nexercise that shows a trait of advanced cognition called mental time travel,\nin which they plan for an unforeseeable future moment when sharks may arrive,\nhiding their entire body in a bit of brown, hairy, impenetrable armor.\n\nMimic octopuses are routinely filmed masquerading as flounders, adjusting\ntheir body shape, undulating across the ocean floor in convincing cosplay,\nmaking it less likely that a predator will nip at one of their vulnerable\narms, tucked behind them as they glide across the sea floor.\n\nIn another study, octopuses were presented with two similar shells and one odd\none. If they grabbed the odd one, they were given a food reward. Soon, they\ntransferred that learning to a more general rule, identifying the odd item out\nin sets they hadn\u2019t seen previously. Cuttlefish have also passed the\nmarshmallow test.\n\nAn octopus may not challenge Max Park for the Rubik\u2019s cube world record, but\ncarrying around foraged body armor in the ocean depths and inferring rules and\ncategories to extract rewards? That is seriously smart.\n\n###\n\nIV: Live slow and social, die smart?\n\nYet, octopus intelligence poses a tricky puzzle. For every vertebrate with\ncomplex cognition, two main theories of intelligence help explain how it\nemerged.\n\n  1. The Ecological Intelligence Hypothesis: intelligence emerges to help creatures find food in difficult environments.\n\n  2. The Social Intelligence Hypothesis: creatures that live in social groups require complex cognition to cooperate, deceive, form social bonds, and learn from one another.\n\nThe latter, in particular, makes sense if you\u2019re planning to stick around for\na while, learn smarter strategies for survival, and teach your young how to\nbehave. These theories match the vertebrate data really well: crows, dolphins,\nand primates (including us) all have long lives (a minimum of 15+ years); take\ncare of their offspring; and are capable of reproducing multiple times in one\nlifespan.\n\nBy contrast, most cephalopods live alone, survive for between six months and\ntwo years; don\u2019t take care of their offspring, and produce children just once,\nthen die.\n\nResearchers have recently proposed that the evolution of advanced cephalopod\ncognition emerged when they were forced to become more adaptable, and\njettisoned their hard shells (which persisted in cousin species like\nnautiluses). This had a major advantage\u2014flexibility in habitat\u2014which is why\ncephalopods are found pretty much everywhere in oceans. But it came with a\ncost: without a shell, they faced an abrupt surge in predators eating them,\nwhich required a get-smart-quick scheme, a pressure that led to advanced\ncognition. The puzzle persists, however. After all, many animals get devoured;\nfew become brainiacs. We don\u2019t have the answers.\n\nWhy, other than the fact that octopuses are stupefyingly interesting, should\nwe care about this? Because it implies a profound idea: there are multiple\nevolutionary pathways and biological architectures that create intelligence.\nThe study of cephalopods can yield new ways of thinking about artificial\nintelligence, consciousness, and plausible imaginings of unknown alien\nintelligence.\n\n###\n\nV: Why we are uniquely stupid\n\nBut there\u2019s another lesson we can learn from cephalopods about our own\nstupidity. What an octopus lacks\u2014which we have in spades\u2014is rigid, stubborn\nideology. Our unique ability to reason with generalized concepts, to imagine\nworlds that don\u2019t exist, to conjure up distorted mental models of how we think\nreality functions\u2014from outlandish conspiracy theories, to religious and\npolitical zealotry\u2014can blind us to obvious truths.\n\nIn Fluke, I mention Alfred Wegener, the balloonist who proposed that the\ncontinents must have drifted, given how clearly their coastlines fit together\nlike a jigsaw puzzle. Blinded by scientific precepts, what is now plainly\nobvious to any child who glances at a map of South America and Africa, was\nresisted\u2014for vast stretches of time\u2014by the world\u2019s smartest thinkers.\n\nOr, more prominent today, consider a conspiracy theorist or political\nideologue who will never change their mind, no matter the evidence. That\u2019s a\nuniquely resilient form of stupidity, more familiar to Marjorie Taylor Greene\nthan to, say, the average porpoise. After all, an octopus or squid may not\nsolve a Rubik\u2019s cube, but cephalopods are unlikely to resist relevant, useful\ninformation simply because the data doesn\u2019t match its ideology about how the\nworld should work.\n\nHumans, therefore, arguably possess the widest spectrum of behaviors along the\nKrakauer definition of intelligence. We are capable of the most astonishing\nfeats of cognition, externalized outside our minds across vast stretches of\ntime and space. But we are also capable of breathtaking stupidity, imagining\nthat it\u2019s a good idea to turn over a nuclear arsenal to Donald Trump, or, at\nthe delightful pinnacles of human beclowning, that we can camouflage ourselves\nby making our faces invisible with lemon juice.\n\nIf you enjoy my writing, or learn something new from it, consider an\nexbodiment of your intelligence, by doing the smart thing and upgrading to a\npaid subscription for the low, low price of just $4 per month. Or, you can\nshow off your advanced cognition by doing something no octopus can: buy and\nread my new book, FLUKE.\n\nShare\n\n1\n\nWhen I first came across this story, I couldn\u2019t stop cackling. I love\npicturing the astonishment on the face of these bumbling crooks when they took\na picture with the Polaroid lens facing the wrong way and believed themselves\nto be invisible. Thank you, McArthur Wheeler, wherever you are, for bringing\nme so much joy.\n\n2\n\nAs readers of Fluke will recall, octopus eyes are a remarkable example of\nconvergent evolution. We have basically the same eye structure as they do.\n\n3\n\nSome inter-generational transfers of information may occur through\nepigenetics\u2014of trauma, for example. But it\u2019s hardly the same as us reading\nAristotle in 2024.\n\n4\n\nDo not e-mail me and tell me it\u2019s \u201coctopi.\u201d (This has happened). It\u2019s not. You\nare wrong.\n\n5\n\nBird brains are a bit different from ours (the neocortex of a mammal has cells\norganized in layers; the analogous avian pallium is organized with cells in\nclusters).\n\n6\n\nWe have around 86 billion neurons. Octopuses have similar numbers to dogs.\n\n7\n\nOne species of octopus, the argonaut, is a short king, growing only 10% the\nsize of the female\u2014but he is not deterred, using his third arm, an appendage\nthat doubles as a detachable penis, which he dutifully shoots at the much\nlarger female.\n\n### Subscribe to The Garden of Forking Paths\n\nBy Brian Klaas \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nWandering around an infinitely complex, ever changing world.\n\n43 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n10 Restacks\n\n43\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Evolution of Stupidity (and Octopus Intelligence)\n\nwww.forkingpaths.co\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nThe Myth of the Secret Genius\n\nFrom Elon Musk to Elizabeth Holmes and Donald Trump, many very rich people are\neffective at convincing us of a myth: they're secretly a genius, and...\n\nNov 30, 2022 \u2022\n\nBrian Klaas\n\n505\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Myth of the Secret Genius\n\nwww.forkingpaths.co\n\n6\n\nThe Case for Amplifying Trump's Insanity\n\nThe \"Banality of Crazy\" has warped American politics, as few voters recognize\njust how deranged, delusional, and dangerous Donald Trump is...because the...\n\nOct 1, 2023 \u2022\n\nBrian Klaas\n\n416\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Case for Amplifying Trump's Insanity\n\nwww.forkingpaths.co\n\n49\n\nMy \"Life in the UK\" Test and a Great British Travel Guide\n\nI passed my \"Life in the UK\" test and will soon (hopefully) become a dual\ncitizen of the US and UK.
