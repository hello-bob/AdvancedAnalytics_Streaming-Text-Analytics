Now, however, it\u2019s found out the hard way that EVs\naren\u2019t the solid investments it first thought, so is offloading them at an\nalarming pace to try and cut its losses, according to Autoweek. As the site\nexplains:\n\n> Nominally, Hertz aims to make money on selling its used rental cars after\n> they accumulate a certain mileage. At least, it has generally made money in\n> the past via this business model with internal-combustion vehicles. But the\n> same has not been true for used EVs.\n>\n> The culprits, once again, have been high maintenance costs and depreciation\n> of EVs it has purchased for its fleets, while on the consumer side the EV\n> charging experience has seen its own issues.\n>\n> The result has been a loss of $392 million in the first quarter, despite a\n> 2% growth in revenues over the same period in 2023 amid overall revenues of\n> $2.1 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHertz initially planned to sell 20,000 electric models from its fleet, however\nan additional $195 million charge last quarter as a result of depreciation\nacross its fleet left it with no choice but to sell even more electric cars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 30,000 Hertz is now selling are the latest black spot in its experiment\nwith EVs, which some reports estimate have cost the American rental giant as\nmuch as $440 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 2nd Gear: Aston Martin Losses Grow Due To Low Sales, High Spending\n\nDespite the successful rollout of its first luxury SUV kick starting a sales\nrevolution at Aston martin, and a whole heap of cash being thrown at the brand\nby Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, the British supercar maker still\nisn\u2019t out of the woods just yet. Now, the company has posted greater than\nexpected losses for the start of 2024 as a result of slowing sales and higher\nspending at the company, reports Reuters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAston Martin sold just 945 cars in the first three months of the year, which\nwas down on analysts\u2019 average expectations of 1,024. The slowdown was hampered\nby a drop in sales of the DBX SUV as well as higher costs, reports the\nFinancial Times. As the site explains:\n\n> The company had previously flagged that it expected a weaker start to the\n> year but anticipated that a wave of new car launches would help drive sales\n> and profitability in the second half.\n>\n> The figures, which are worse than expected, demonstrate the scale of the\n> challenge facing Aston\u2019s incoming chief executive, Adrian Hallmark, who has\n> been poached from Volkswagen\u2019s Bentley and will start later this year.\n>\n> Philippe Houchois, an automotive analyst at Jefferies, said the company was\n> going through a \u201cpainful transition\u201d, with a similar performance expected in\n> the coming quarter as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe transition for the company is one that\u2019s being felt across the automotive\nindustry and brands make the switch to hybrid power and electrification. For\nAston Martin, however, plans to electrify the lineup have been put on hold,\nwith Reuters reporting that the brand\u2019s first EV has been pushed back by a\nyear.\n\nInstead of pivoting to electric power, Aston Martin today announced that a new\nflagship, V12-powered supercar will hit the market at the end of 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 3rd Gear: Carvana Could Be On The Up\n\nWhile Aston Martin is struggling, cursed sales platform Carvana seems to have\nfinally rid itself of its bad luck and is on the way up. After months of sky-\nhigh losses, the automotive retailer might be ready to grow once again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarvana was forced to dial back its car retail business last year after it\nstruggled with sale bans in several states, sky-high costs and dwindling\nsales. Now, the company looks ready to bounce back as it prepares to report\nits latest financial results, reports Automotive News. As the site explains:\n\n> Chris Pierce, a senior research analyst at Needham & Co., said he expects\n> analysts will want more specificity about Carvana\u2019s growth plans \u2014 such as\n> whether it plans to ramp up vehicle marketing soon to drive sales \u2014 when it\n> holds its first-quarter earnings call Wednesday. Pierce estimated Carvana\n> sold about 83,200 vehicles in the first quarter. In first-quarter 2023, it\n> sold 79,240 vehicles.\n>\n> \u201cIf they do turn on growth, then what does that mean?\u201d Pierce said. \u201cIs it\n> just more marketing or are they going to buy more cars?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next question for Carvana will be how does it turn its shrinking loses\ninto profitability? That will all hinge on how many cars it expects to sell\nthis year and what markets it could potentially break into. One thing\u2019s clear\nthough, the tumultuous history for the retailer looks to finally be behind it.\n\n## 4th Gear: UAW To Vote On Stellantis Strike Action\n\nAfter historic industrial action saw workers walk out at plants operated by\nFord, General Motors and Stellantis last year, the United Auto Workers Union\nlooks to be getting ready for round two.

We have to fight for every\n> single pair of work gloves, while we handle metal and materials to build\n> world-class vehicles for Stellantis.
