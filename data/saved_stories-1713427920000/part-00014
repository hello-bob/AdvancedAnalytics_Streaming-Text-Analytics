I've written a variety of fiction based around these. The most\nimportant thing, I find, when coming up with a new theory, is to try to trip\nit up in every way imaginable and make sure it still works.\n\nHere I go with every model of time travel I can think of.\n\n### Contents\n\n  * Time travel is impossible\n  * Fixed History model\n  * Malleable History model\n  * Sensitive History model\n  * Pause for thought: Why single-modifiable-history models don't work\n  * Multiple History model\n  * Time loops\n  * Two histories create each other\n  * More imaginative structures\n\n### Time travel is impossible\n\nBy FAR the most likely of all the various possibilities. There are no time\ntravellers because it's impossible to travel through time. Time is an\nillusion, perhaps, not even a proper dimension. Spacetime is a rigid crystal\nwith worms (us) stuck inside, never changing.\n\nThis is also by far the dullest time travel model, and is implicitly used in\nalmost every piece of fiction ever written.\n\n#### Time is a loop\n\nThe postulation that time is a loop - that is, after the universe ends in a\nBig Crunch, it goes back to the original Big Bang and starts all over again\nexactly the same - essentially doesn't change the fact that time travel is\nimpossible. As nothing coherent can actually survive the Crunch and Bang,\nnothing can actually go all the way around the loop and be present in its own\npast.\n\n### Fixed History model\n\nThis states that:\n\n  * Time travel IS possible.\n  * There is only one timeline.\n  * History CANNOT be changed. Any time you try to change history, it will turn out you were supposed to make that change all along.\n\nThis model, assuming it allows an individual to travel back in time to their\nown past light cone, allows individuals to interfere with their own past and\nthus necessarily includes some level of predestination paradox. For example:\nsomebody comes from the future and tells you to get into the time machine. You\nget into the time machine. You go back to the past. You tell your past self to\nget into the time machine. It is also entirely possible for universes\nemploying this model to include causal loops: ideas and objects which have no\norigin point.\n\nThe majority of stories involving time travel make use of this very simple\nmodel. The major difference within stories is in how the universe resists\nchanges to the timeline. For example, if you go back in time and try to kill\nHitler or your own grandfather, something, somehow, will stop you. But how?\nThere are four ways I can think of, four sub-models of time travel:\n\n#### The timeline is preserved through dumb luck\n\nThis is a favourite; it's used with varying degrees of seriousness in Twelve\nMonkeys, Futurama, Timeline and The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\n\n#### The timeline is actively protected by an intelligence of some kind\n\nThe degree of interaction can vary here. We can have anything from human\nintelligences who send things or people back in time because historical\nrecords SAY that was what happened (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, The\nTerminator) to (occasionally cosmic) police forces which actually have to go\nback in time after rogue time travellers to stop them from wrecking the\ntimeline (DC comic book universe, Doctor Who).\n\nBut in some cases it's dangerous to put certain works of fiction under the\nheading of \"history can never be changed\" just because history never IS\nchanged. Just because a timeline is always preserved doesn't mean that it's\nimpossible for the timeline to be altered.\n\nIndeed, if it really was impossible to change history, such active\npreservation would be completely unnecessary!\n\n#### The timeline is preserved by quantum\n\nAnother possibility is detailed in Stephen Baxter's book \"Time\", in which it\nseems that time travel involves the sending back and forth through time of\nquantum packets of information, which alter history multiple times in a kind\nof feedback loop until the universe settles into a stable structure in which\nthe instance of time travel is completely internally consistent.\n\n#### Time travel isn't always possible\n\nAlternatively, one may have a universe which only allows time travel at\ncertain instants in time and space and only allows a single certain object to\ntravel through time at each instant. This means a time machine will only work\nat predetermined points in time and will be completely non-functional the rest\nof the time, or if the wrong thing is in the machine.\n\nIn this case the universe is kind of like an office building with time being\nheight, and a finite number elevator shafts leading between certain floors\nsymbolising individual instances of time travel. You can't go back in time\nunless it's predetermined that you will, and everything will work out fine: if\nyou try, you'll fail.\n\nThis model is approximately used in Time Bandits. This is a recognised\npossible variant on every valid time travel model; for example, it may be that\nthere are no time travellers around us because nobody has built a \"receiving\nstation\" to accept an incoming time traveller from the future yet, or because\nthere is a blockade across spacetime at some future point in time, across\nwhich time travellers are simply unable to pass.\n\n### Malleable History model\n\nThis is the model which is used (which slight customisations) in the Back To\nThe Future movies and in Star Trek.\n\n  * There is only one timeline.\n  * History is a resilient beast. You can travel back in time, and alter history slightly, but generally you are free to wander around and as long as you don't do anything hugely anachronistic you can get away with it, and return to the future safely.\n  * However, there are certain points in history with relatively large \"historical imperative\", events which are almost fated to happen. If you alter these, it can radically affect the future. The death of Edith Keeler. The point where Marty's dad first meets his future wife. First contact. Mess these up, and future history will jump onto a very different track. But - here's the important thing - you can restore history to the right track if you set everything approximately straight.\n\nThis doesn't actually make a whole lot of logical sense. Scientific\nimpartiality necessitates that every point in history be as significant as\nevery other point, and chaos theory dictates that small changes to a highly\ncomplex system such as the Earth's weather system can result in massive\nchanges in the long term. Over the course of a generation, even if you reset\neverything to approximately back how they're supposed to be (Marty's future\nparents meet a little later than usual, hey ho), the changes will add up\nagain. Sooner or later, not to put too fine a point on it, different children\nwill be born to the same parents, and after only a generation or two, the\nwhole world will be being run by different people, and thus the whole world\nwill run differently.\n\nOf course, intuitively this is a difficult concept for the non-scientifically-\nminded to grasp so it's easy to see why this isn't the case in these two\nimportant continuities.\n\nImportant sub-models:\n\n#### Back To The Future\n\nBTTF contains elements which make relatively little scientific sense. For one\nthing: alterations to the timeline take time to propagate. For example, Old\nBiff Tannen goes back in time from 2015 to 1955 and changes history so that\n1985 becomes dark and nasty, but then he returns to the good 2015, which\nsomehow has not been erased yet. And changes don't propagate fully, either:\nMarty partially disappears, but there's no way that he could somehow be\npartially born. And changes don't change things consistently. Marty's photo of\nDoc's gravestone changes to a photo of a blank gravestone, then a photo of\njust random grass - so why doesn't the photo disappear completely? Why would\npast Marty have taken a photo of nothing, and why, for that matter, does he\nremember what the gravestone used to say when the photo doesn't? Shouldn't his\nmind also change?\n\nA consistent model to explain BTTF in its entirety can probably be\nconstructed, but not easily. Most of these inconsistencies, however, are\ndramatic elements more than anything else.\n\n#### Star Trek\n\nStar Trek has run long enough to include examples of all kinds of other models\nof time travel, as well as plenty of crazy rubbish which makes no sense. The\nmodel given here is approximately correct, but there are technicalities.\n\n### Sensitive History model\n\nThis is the version of the Malleable Future model which incorporates the chaos\ntheory elements I mentioned above.\n\n  * There's only one timeline.\n  * Any time you go back in time, you change history.\n  * You can NEVER set everything perfectly back the way it was.\n\nHow big a problem this is depends on how far back in time you go. If you go\nback to before you were born and change history enough that you were never\nborn, or worse, somebody else was born in your place (your sibling, by most\ndefinitions), you're in trouble. But if you go back five minutes, who cares?\n\nOf course, there are bigger issues here. What if you go back in time and stop\nyourself getting into the time machine? It's a common misconception that this\nwould cause a paradox. There is NO SUCH THING as a paradox. They can't exist,\nby definition. And since you, just before getting into your time machine,\ndidn't meet anybody right beforehand, that means the person you're looking at\nCANNOT be your past self. So you can stop him getting into the time machine,\nand there will be no problem, except that there's now two of you! One of whom\njust appeared out of thin air. This violates the law of conservation of mass-\nenergy, but that's a small price to pay for working time travel.\n\nThis model is used in Schlock Mercenary.\n\n### Pause for thought: Why single-modifiable-history models don't work\n\nThe major problem with both the Malleable and Sensitive History models is:\nwhere are all the time travellers? Suppose you get in a time machine and go\nback in time. The universe alters itself, starting from your re-entry point\nwith you appearing instead of, say, nothing happening. But what makes you and\nyour perceptions special? What makes this new universe one in which you appear\nin mid-air out of nowhere, but nobody else? Theoretically, anybody could\nappear out of space at any time, having travelled back from some hypothetical\nprevious timeline. What stops them? The answer: nothing, really, unless time\ntravel is REALLY, REALLY hard.\n\nThis means that basic history in any fictional universe which utilises these\nmodels SHOULD be absolutely crammed to the gills with timelines. The entire\nuniverse is horrifyingly unstable.\n\nAlso: how do the changes occur? For a timeline to initially be like this but\nthen change to be like that, something - something very like time - must have\npassed. Somewhere along this secondary time axis there's an initial timeline\nand further along there's the timeline we're in now. But we just said there's\nonly one timeline, when clearly there are at least two!\n\nSo from a standpoint of a fiction writer, these models are problematic, or at\nleast contradictory. But we can solve these issues with the following:\n\n### Multiple History model\n\nThis is the simplest consistent model of time travel I could devise which\nallowed history to change, but also explained the lack of time travellers.\n\n  * You can go back in time whenever you like.\n  * Every time you go back in time, you create an entirely new timeline.\n  * If you go forwards in time, you stay in your current timeline.\n\nThis means you can go back in time and change history. Easily. But that act\ncreates a new and different timeline. You can never return to the timeline\nwhere you originally started, because going forwards in time just leaves you\nin the timeline two and going backwards in time for a second attempt would\nleave you in a third timeline. The net effect in your home timeline is that\nyou have simply disappeared forever. If you go back in time to kill Hitler,\nyou don't undo the Second World War, it stays happened, you just give\neverybody involved a chance to die all over again.\n\nThis is a model of time travel which I described in my story Be Here Now and\nexplored very thoroughly in later Ed stories. Several other people have\ninvented it independently and several other stories can fit alongside it,\nwhich is logical, since it is the second-simplest wholly consistent model.\n\nNominally this results in a finite (but large) number of timelines running\nparallel with each other, as people go back in time over and over and create\nmore timelines. However, it could also be that the timelines simply run\nsequentially, one after the other. After the original universe ends, the first\nuniverse that was created through time travel starts over right away, and so\non until they're all done. Equally, it could be that the original timeline\nsimply ceases to exist when the time travellers depart backwards in time. In\nthis case, it is more as if the time travellers are \"unwinding\" the universe\nback to some earlier state and then resuming normal movement through space\nafterwards -- again, as if the multiple timelines are running sequentially.\n\nObviously this model comes in the Malleable and Sensitive varieties described\nabove. The Malleable version COULD be the version used in Star Trek and does\nseem to be the version used in Terry Pratchett's novel \"Night Watch\" - this\nwould mean, when you go back in time, you DO create a new timeline and alter\nthe universe, just not significantly; possibly insignificantly enough that the\ntwo slightly disparate timelines could even be recombined at a later date!\n(Something very much along these lines happens during DC's Crisis On Infinite\nEarths.)\n\nA variation on this model could have timelines adjusting slowly into one\nanother across this \"secondary time\" axis, instead of just instantly changing.\nAdding in the condition that every time traveller remains \"tied\" to their\n\"original era\", this would enable the scenario seen in the DC crossover \"Zero\nHour\", in which people born thousands of years ago disappear in increasing\norder of birthdate, and people from the future also disappearing, as history\nis \"eaten up\" from both ends.\n\n#### Primer\n\nAfter being encouraged to do so by several people, I watched the movie Primer,\nwhich I would describe as the Mount Everest of time travel movies. I could\nexpend a great deal of effort reconstructing the precise network of timelines\nwhich the movie follows but it appears that this has already been done.\n\nPrimer does indeed obey this Multiple History model, with a few subtle\nelaborations. Primer's time machines do not operate instantaneously. They are\nenclosed boxes in which - loosely speaking - time flows backwards instead of\nforwards while the box is turned on. To travel back in time you actually have\nto sit inside the box and wait for time to pass (backwards). In addition, you\ncannot travel back to any point in time you like, only to the point when you\noriginally switched the box on. Leaving earlier than this point is impossible\nbecause the box is not turned on. Leaving later (e.g. minutes or hours AFTER\nthe box was turned on) results in illness, coma or (presumably) death.\nTherefore, time travel in the Primer universe involves, more than anything\nelse, preparation and forward thinking.\n\n### Time loops\n\nThis is an extremely important subgenre in the time travel genre. If you have\nwatched Groundhog Day or Day Break then you know precisely what I'm about to\ndescribe.\n\nThe idea is that a single individual is uncontrollably bumped backwards in\ntime to the same moment in time, over and over again. In the two examples\ndescribed above it is the beginning of the day. The protagonist wakes up,\nmakes whatever actions he wishes, and then at the end of the day he suddenly\nwakes up in bed again at the exact same time, retaining his memories from all\nthe previous loops... until he \"gets it right\" and time continues on as\nnormal. In these two specific cases, an actual mechanism or explanation for\nthe time looping is never provided. This is a relatively explicit\nacknowledgement of a fundamental tenet of science fiction, which is that, very\nfrequently, the science has nothing to do with the true story.\n\nThe actual appearance of the timeline as all of this occurs is debatable. Does\neach loop create a real additional timeline, as in the Multiple History model?\nDo events continue to play out as normal in those additional timelines? Does\nthe protagonist appear to physically vanish from those timelines when he is\nwarped back to the beginning of the day, or does some kind of \"split\" occur?\n\nIt's clear from the presentation of such stories (the abandoned, \"imperfect\"\ntimelines are invariably completely ignored) that this is not actually the\ncase. They are personal stories about the looped person, nothing else. Thus we\ncan adapt the Fixed History model to suit this instead. Here, there is only a\nsingle timeline, and the protagonist is the only one who continues to\nexperience time in the normal fashion while everything else in the universe\nrepeatedly reverts to the same initial state all around him. From \"above\", the\ntimeline appears to repeat over and over (all except for our one guy), until\nthe \"skipping\" is \"fixed\".\n\n#### Day Break\n\nIn the TV series Day Break, the system is very internally consistent. At the\nend of the day, the hero's body is actually, literally reinserted at the\nbeginning of the day, preserving his overall mental state as well as his\nphysical state. For this reason, a bullet wound he receives early on the story\nhas to be dressed every morning as he gradually heals up over the course of\nmore days. (Only his physical body goes back in time; his clothes and bandages\nand the bullet itself do not. This proves problematic if he is badly wounded\njust before time loops.) In addition, we could logically conclude that if he\nstayed in the time loop for long enough, he would start to show physical signs\nof ageing.\n\nIn Day Break it is explicitly acknowledged by the hero that the additional,\n\"bad\" timelines may still go on existing \"somewhere out there\", and so his\nrepeated failures continue to haunt him even though everything appears to\nrevert to normal from his point of view.\n\n#### Groundhog Day\n\nIn Groundhog Day the hero is driven to desperation by his inability to escape\nthe loop and attempts (and succeeds in) suicide, multiple times. Nevertheless\nhe still wakes up intact at the beginning of the day every time. Groundhog Day\nis much more of a \"spiritual\" kind of movie, though; the story is not a\ntangled crime mystery but a journey of personal growth for Bill Murray's\ncharacter, so it would make sense to say that it is his \"immortal soul\" which\ngets sent back in time each day, not the rest of him.\n\n### Two histories create each other\n\nThis is a variation on the Fixed History model. When you go back in time, you\nalso switch tracks into a different timeline entirely. You're free to change\nhistory because it's not YOUR history. Somehow, somewhere, somebody goes back\nin time and makes changes to THEIR history to thus create YOUR timeline. It's\nless of a causal loop than a causal figure-of-eight. This model becomes much,\nmuch more complicated once more than two instances of time travel are\nintroduced.\n\nThis model is used in my story The Four-And-A-Halfth Planet. I realise this\narticle is sounding more and more like a promotional article for my fiction.\nIt's not - as I say, I like exploring different models of time travel, and I\nlike writing fiction. And clearly, people aren't imaginative enough! I am told\nthat the book The Time Ships also uses this model, though with more than two\ntimelines.\n\n### More imaginative structures\n\nConsider a timeline as a line on a page, with a definite beginning (the Big\nBang), but possibly no end. Now let that timeline twist...\n\n#### Helix\n\nTime travel is possible, but you can only jump backwards or forwards by\nprecisely a hundred years - every other era is inaccessible to you. The Sherri\nS. Tepper novel \"Family Tree\" uses this model with a period of 3,000 years.\n\n#### Two timelines going past each other in opposite directions\n\nYou can't go back in time - all you can do is jump tracks. But if you want to\ngo back in time a year, you just jump tracks, wait a year, and jump tracks\nagain! Each track-jump sort of \"knits\" the two universes together a little. Of\ncourse, this means that local time in the two universes will be different. You\nwould have to calculate the point where the two clocks meet to be somewhere\ncontemporary to get a decent story out of this.\n\n#### Timequake\n\nKurt Vonnegut's book Timequake is very difficult to classify. In the book, in\n2001, everybody is suddenly plunged back in time 10 years but forced to repeat\nall their actions of those ten years a second time. They watch helplessly\nwhile their past selves make the same mistakes all over again. In other words,\nhistory goes completely unchanged, unless you count what goes on inside of\npeople's heads. Actually, if people's mental patterns did indeed change, then\ntheir actions (which are directly affected by these patterns) would also\nchange, so this can't actually be what happens either. The phenomenon is\nbetter explained as simply having your memories of those ten years replayed,\nat maximum clarity, at high speed, all in that single moment in 2001 - in\nother words, no actual time travel occurs, just a perverse trick of memory.\n\n#### One timeline, which suddenly reverses direction\n\nMaybe it reverses many times. Who knows?\n\nKeep going along these lines. You can get CRAZY stuff out. There's more I\nhaven't said, and, naturally, the dramatic possibilities are limited only by\nyour imagination (apologies, those of you with poor imaginations).\n\nBack to Time\n\nBack to Things Of Interest\n\nContact\n\nAbout\n\n\u00a9 qntm\n\n", "frontpage": false}
