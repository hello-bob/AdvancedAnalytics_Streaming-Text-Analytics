The\ncommission, however, is not expected to single out Russia in its statement and\nwill only make reference to the manipulation of information by foreign actors.\n\nEU officials also fear that the company\u2019s mechanism to let users flag illegal\ncontent is not easily accessible or user-friendly enough to comply with the\nEU\u2019s Digital Services Act, the bloc\u2019s landmark legislation designed to police\ncontent online.\n\nThe law, approved in April last year, includes measures to force platforms to\ndisclose what steps they are taking to tackle misinformation or propaganda. If\nthe EU finds Meta to be in breach of the Act, it could be fined up to 6\npercent of its global annual turnover.\n\nThe move represents the latest regulatory action taken by the commission\nagainst Big Tech groups, as fears grow among member states that Russia is\npushing disinformation on social media to undermine democracy ahead of Europe-\nwide elections in early June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe commission is to start the investigation based on a report sent by Meta in\nSeptember on how it is handling disinformation risks on its platform as well\nas the EU\u2019s own assessment.\n\nThe investigation will assess whether the way Facebook and Instagram place\npolitical content on their sites is compliant with the law.\n\nInvestigators will look into whether Meta has failed to mitigate risks as it\nlooks to discontinue CrowdTangle, a tool that shows publishers how content is\nspreading across the site, and to outline concerns related to how Meta tracks\ndisinformation to help fact-checkers and journalists.\n\nThe commission is expected to give Meta five working days to say what it will\ndo to mitigate the situation or threaten the social media group with measures\nunder the DSA, the people said.\n\nThere is no set deadline for the investigation to end and it will depend on\nMeta\u2019s willingness to cooperate, the EU is expected to say.\n\n\u201cWe have a well-established process for identifying and mitigating risks on\nour platforms,\u201d said Meta. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our cooperation with\nthe European Commission and providing them with further details of this work.\u201d\n\nThe commission did not reply to a request for comment. The timing of the\nannouncement can still shift, the people said.\n\nMeta\u2019s probe follows a separate investigation into X in relation to illegal\ncontent and disinformation of violent and terrorist content spreading on its\nplatform after Hamas\u2019s October 7 attacks against Israel.\n\nIt also comes after regulators imposed election safeguards aimed to counter\nonline threats to the integrity of electoral processes. As a result of the\nguidelines, social media platforms such as X and Meta will be required to\nscrutinize the risks of online disinformation across the bloc.\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Financial Times Ltd.
