They\u2019re going from 700,000-800,000 expected to 400,000-450,000 \u2014\nimplying that things really did not work out how they imagined.\n\nKuo says that demand has \u201cfallen sharply beyond expectations\u201d in the U.S.,\nthough to most non-tech-industry-immersed observers this does not seem\nterribly shocking.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro is a $3,500 headset with some of the best technology on\nthe market, and yet it cannot do basic things like have a native Netflix app\nor play loads of VR games that work on other devices. Plus, it\u2019s heavy enough\nwhere people were reporting fatigue or pain while using it for any extended\nperiod of time.\n\nBut I think this problem extends past the Vision Pro, its pricing and its\nfeatures. It\u2019s just yet another example of VR/AR tech failing to become\nmainstream, and a sign that this road ultimately leads nowhere if one thing\nremains true: You must wear something large on your face.\n\nThat\u2019s it, really. The appeal of VR and the coolness of this or that you might\nbe able to do with it is simply overwhelming by no one wanting to wear stuff\non their faces. With cords, without cords, it hasn\u2019t mattered. This is just\nnot going to happen to the extent these companies want it to, and if Apple of\nall companies can\u2019t figure out to make a widely appealing device in this\nmarket, I don\u2019t know who will.\n\nThis thing could have cost $1,000 and we\u2019d still be here having this\nconversation.\n\nPeople use Meta Quest VR headset at the Meta showroom in Brussels on December\n07, 2022.

Every time one of these conversations happens\nthe comments will fill up with \u201cwell I use my Meta Quest nightly,\u201d but in the\nnear-decade since VR arrived, do you know anyone in your life who routinely\nuses VR? More than one person? Hell, even if you personally own a VR headset,\ndo you use it regularly? I firmly believe that VR sales, where a 2022 estimate\nput the market size at $23 billion, are overstating the actual use of this\ntech. I don\u2019t believe there have been studios about this yet, but you can bet\nthat if someone spends $500 on both a PlayStation 5 and VR headset, they are\nprobably using the former a hundred times more than the latter. An iPhone or\nPC? A thousand times. And I am speaking as someone who owns two VR headsets\nwhich have been in a closet for roughly three years.\n\nThis just isn\u2019t going to happen. If you want to keep throwing money at this\ntech to please this overstated market, you are wasting your time. Meta tried\nto fashion the metaverse out of this idea, and all they did is made a system\nthat can play a handful of decent video games (though far fewer than consoles\nor PC). Apple was more focused on the Vision pro being some sort of beacon of\nproductivity both at home or at work, and instead people mainly are just\nwatching movies in the Safari web browser. If it\u2019s on your face, it is not\npractical for any significant task for 99% of the population. This is a dead\nend.\n\nCHIBA, JAPAN - SEPTEMBER 15: An attendee wearing a Sony PlayStation VR2 (PS\nVR2) headset plays the ...

(Photo by Tomohiro\nOhsumi/Getty Images)\n\nGetty Images\n\nI also don\u2019t want to hear that in \u201cjust 10 years\u201d VR will replace anything.\nTrends do not suggest that, and hopefully tech companies will wise up and\nrealize this is not a market worth cultivating. Almost no one wants to wear\nthings on their face. I don\u2019t know how much more clearly to say that, but\nthese companies keep pursuing what they believe is sci-fi tech that has few\nactual use cases and is an almost impossible sell for the majority of the\ngeneral public. And if you do get them to buy one, a huge percentage of those\nwill likely regret it and shelve it in short order.\n\nSo no, it\u2019s not shocking that the Apple Vision Pro isn\u2019t meeting expectations,\nbut all companies, not just Apple, really need to wake up to what\u2019s going on\nhere, that this just isn\u2019t going to happen.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to Apple for comment and will update if I hear back.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram.\n\nPick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and The Earthborn Trilogy.\n\nPaul Tassi\n\nI\u2019ve been writing about video games, television and movies for Forbes\n\n...\n\n  * Editorial Standards\n  * Print\n  * Reprints & Permissions\n\n", "frontpage": false}
