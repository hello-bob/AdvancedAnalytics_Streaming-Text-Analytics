It is not to be confused with a unicycle, which has\nthe rider above the wheel. You'll see what I mean.\n\n(Sometimes the word \"motorwheel\" refers to just a wheel with an engine built\ninto it, as opposed to having a separate motor that turns the wheel via an\naxle. See The Merkel Motorwheel )\n\nTwo wheels one after the other is just a motorcycle- unless what they support\nis actually a complete car, with gyroscope stabilisation to stop it falling\nover. See the next-door gallery: Gyrocars\n\nI put this page together purely as the result of a coincidence. I happened to\nsee photographs of the Gerdes and the McLean monowheels on the same day (in\nwidely differing circumstances) and I thought that this must be one of the\nmost neglected modes of transport ever. That this neglect is wholly justified\nis neither here nor there.\n\nI was pretty sure I was constructing one of the most obscure pages on the Net,\nbut as always I did a quick Alta Vista to look for any possible info on\nmotorwheels. Synchronicity was working hard, because the Daily Telegraph had\nan article on the subject on that very day. See the info on Dr Owen's machines\nbelow.\n\nPictures of the earliest real monowheels kindly provided by Jackie Chabanais,\nwho can be seen below gerbilling happily in his Tractowheel. He has a website\nat http://www.jackiechabanais.com\n\nTHE ROUSSEAU MONOWHEEL: 1869\n\n1869 seems to have been a good year for monowheels. At least four appeared,\none of them the subject of the first monowheel patent.\n\nThe First Monowheel?\n\nThis elegant monowheel cycle- the word \"bicycle\" seems somehow inappropriate,\nthough there are certainly two wheels involved- dates back to 1869. It was\nbuilt by Rousseau of Marseilles. \"In 1869 the craftsman Rousseau of Marseilles\nbuilt this monocycle, which perches the cyclist on the inside of a 2 1/2\nyards-high wheel. As there is no steering mechanism, it makes uncommon demands\non the rider's sense of balance.\" (from Galbiati & Ciravegna)\n\nPresumably the bigger outer wheel made bumps in the road easier to negotiate;\ncompare the popular penny-farthing or \"ordinary\" bicycle. What it does not\nhave is the gearing-up given by the large wheel of a penny-farthing. Note the\nsolid rim- this is before pneumatic tyres were introduced. There is no gearing\nand no steering. There is a brake, operated by twisting the handlebar forward.\nThis pulls a strap that causes the curved lever to press against the rim of\nthe inner wheel.\n\nThe machine is in the Museo Fermo Galbiati, Via Mameli 15, Brugherio, Milan,\nItaly. (A bicycle museum)\n\nBibliography: \"Bicycles\" by Fermo Galbiati and Nino Ciravegna Chronicle Books,\n1994, ISBN 0-8118-0750-9\n\nImage, info & reference kindly provided by Paul Dunlop.\n\nTHE JACKSON MONOWHEEL: 1869\n\nLeft: The Jackson Monowheel: 1869.\n\nThis surprisingly modern-looking monowheel is in the Velorama National Bicycle\nMuseum in Nijmegen, Holland. It is actually a replica of an original built by\nW. Jackson & Co, Paris, France, in 1869. It is not currently clear if the\nreplica is based on original components of the Jackson monowheel.\n\nThe diameter of the wheel is approximately 1.65 metres (5 ft 5 in). The\nmonocycle is treadle driven, the treadles being connected by rods to cranks on\nthe axle of the inner driving wheel. This wheel runs in a semi-circular groove\non the the inside of the inner rim of the main wheel.\n\nW. Jackson et Compagnie of Boulevard Malherbes 36, Paris, advertised regularly\nin the short-lived cycling magazine, Le V\ufffdlocip\ufffdde Illustr\ufffd. (It only ran from\nspring 1869 until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870) They appear\nto have been sales agents rather than manufacturers since they offered all\nkinds of cycle: velocipedes, tricycles, quadricycles and the monocycle. Each\none of their adverts carried an engraved picture of the week's offering. The\nmonocycle was featured in the edition of 24 July 1870 at a price of 300\nfrancs; this advert was the basis of the replica at Velorama.\n\nPicture and info by Andreas Vogler and Stephen Ransom\n\nTHE GREENE & DYER MONOWHEEL: 1869\n\nLeft: The Greene & Dyer Monowheel: 1869.\n\nFor some reason the support struts, mentioned below, appear to be missing in\nthis picture\n\nLeft: The Greene & Dyer Monowheel: 1869.\n\nThe seat seems to set very high. Gerbilling would surely be an ever-present\ndanger.\n\nLeft: The Greene & Dyer Monowheel Patent: 1869.\n\nSo far as can be discerned from this drawing, the hand-cranks were directly\nconnected to the wheel, with the treadles connected to them. It is difficult\nto see how the former could be of much use, as the crank radius is small\ncompared with the wheel diameter.\n\nHaving the support struts trail along the ground as you ride seems really\ndaft. Hadn't these chaps heard about friction?\n\nNote that this patent actually has a later number than the Bergner patent\ndescribed below.\n\nThe enigmatic part designated \"I\" is apparently a roof to keep the rain off;\nit seems far too small to be of any use.\n\nImage & info most kindly provided by Stephen Ransom.\n\nTHE FIRST MONOWHEEL PATENT: BERGNER, 1869\n\nAbove: The first known patent for a monowheel.\n\nThis is USA patent 91,510; Greene & Dyer's patent is 91.535 so Bergner only\njust squeaked in ahead of them. Note the very wide dual-rim wheel, which would\nappear to make \"steering by body movements\" a rather tricky proposition. There\nis no information as to whether this design was actually constructed. A most\ninteresting point is that Bergner states that monowheels had already been in\nuse before this date, which implies that the Rousseau monowheel above was not\nthe first. Perhaps there is a legion of lost monowheels... a poignant thought.\n\nImage & info kindly provided by Stephen Ransom.\n\nTHE HARPER MONOWHEEL: 18??\n\nThe monowheel cycle of Lewis H. Harper, from McHught, Minnesota. Date\ncurrently unknown.\n\nThis machine was exhibited in a velo exhibition in England and achieved a then\nunheard of speed of 30 miles an hour. Harper won a prize in England and\nproudly returned to his native country to demonstrate his invention. But at\nhis first public appearance in the United States, the bicycle crashed,\ninjuring its inventor severely. Propulsion was by pedal drive to the lower\ninner wheel.\n\nThis design looks suspiciously similiar to the Rousseau monowheel above. Had\nMr Harper been to Marseilles?\n\nImage & info kindly provided by Ian Bennett.\n\nThe monocycle which was ridden by Harper in England probably should be\ncredited to Friedrich Langmaak and Peter Streiff. Apparently this monowheel\nwas displayed on the stand of G.H. Strong at an exhibition of machinery held\nin San Francisco in 1886.\n\nInfo kindly provided by Stephen Ransom.\n\nTHE HEMMINGS MONOWHEEL: 1869\n\nThis monowheel design was patented by Richard C Hemmings of New Haven,\nConnecticut in 1869.\n\nThis design is unusual as it appears to be hand-propelled; not a good choice\nas our leg muscles have much greater power. Possibly the legs are\ncontributing; the drawing seems to show the feet on treadles, but they don't\nappear to be connected to anything. The rider is protected from the weather by\nan awning J.\n\nWhether this machine was ever built is unknown.\n\nUS Patent No 92,528\n\nTHE GAUTHIER MONOWHEEL: 1881\n\nA French monowheel: the design of M. Gauthier. Post 1881.\n\nThis design has eight spokes and a wheel of 2 metres diameter. The picture\napparently shows the machine with one side removed, but this by no means\ncertain. The accompanying text seems to imply that there were spokes on one\nside only, offset so that the rider's CG came above the wheel tread.\n\nThis picture was originally published in the French scientific journal La\nNature at some date after October 1881. The text stated that this sort of\nmonowheel, with the rider inside the wheel, was not new, and despite the\nimprovements of M Gauthier remained \"impracticable for ordinary mortals\"\nbecause of the difficulty of balancing without the front-back stability\nprovided by the two wheels of a bicycle. Having tried a monowheel myself, I\ncan verify that this is true.\n\nPicture courtesy of Henk Schuurih.\n\nA HORSEDRAWN MONOWHEEL: 1883\n\nA one-horse monowheel design. Date unknown, but probably 1870-1890.\n\nI think this drawing may be a bit confused. Note the two stabiliser wheels\nattached to a transverse leaf-spring.\n\nThe picture was taken from a book of copyright-free images, and I suspected\nthat it was just a concept. For example, the idlers inside the main wheel are\nnot spaced enough around the circumference to keep the inner carriage in\nplace.\n\nHowever... according to The Polish Wikipedia it was a real vehicle built in\n1883 by Polish engineer Stanislaw Barycki.\n\n###### Many thanks to Pawel Adamowicz for drawing this to my attention\n\nIt was called Swallow, also Bulb Horn, (?) and was allegedly a prototype for\nsome sort of track-laying vehicle. This sounds very strange, as it the ultra-\nlight machine shown would appear to be about as far away as one could get from\na heavy tracked vehicle. Anyway, Polish Wikipedia goes on to say:\n\n\"Swallow was one of many other vehicles built by Barycki, who attempted to\nconstruct self-propelled mechanical vehicles. The actual vehicle, with means\nof propulsion and a driver seat, was rolling inside huge rim, considered\nvehicle's \"portable road\". First tests were conducted by rolling the vehicle\ndown the hill. Later, the vehicle was pulled by a horse. Lack of small,\ninternal combustion engines forced the inventor to try out other means of\npropulsion; sail, pedals or a kind of a \"pneumatic device\". (presumably a\ncompressed-air motor) He was against steam engines so consequently he did not\napply any to his vehicle. The social environment of Barycki perceived his\nattempts only as fancy variation of a britzka and not as a revolutionary\nimprovement in travelling. The inventor died in poverty, spending all his\nmoney on the development of his vehicle.\"\n\nSource: Witold Rychter \"Dzieje samochodu\" (\"The history of an automobile\"),\nWKL, Warszawa 1983\n\nThe last bit, \"The inventor died in poverty\" has a plausible ring to it, as\nall engineers will agree. If anyone can shed any more light on this mysterious\nbusiness, I will be most grateful.\n\nDREAMING OF A MONOWHEEL: 1884.\n\nI assume this is wholly imaginary design. It was found in a book on \"Victorian\nInventions\". The original is clearly a drawing rather than a photograph.\n\nThere are two reasons why I believe this to be an imaginary machine.The\nobvious one is that the rider appears to be imprisoned within two complete\nsets of spokes. Presumably the machine was built round him. The second is that\nthe hapless victim looks to be in the gravest danger of gerbilling. (see\nbelow) His centre-of-gravity appears to be roughly at the centre of the wheel,\nso when he pedalled he might simply rotate without generating any sustained\nforce to move the wheel forwards.\n\nInteresting technical features are what appear to be twin tyres, and a sort of\numbrella affair over the rider's head to keep the rain off. Similar roofing\nstructures occur in the Dynosphere and the Rose patent.\n\nHARPER'S MONOWHEEL: 1892.\n\nHarper's monowheel: around 1892.\n\nA monowheel with six spokes and some very complicated bracing around the\nperiphery of the wheel. The widely-spaced spokes would allow the rider to get\nin and out relatively easily. Whether this machine was ever built is unknown.\n\nMy original source described this as \"a design for a French military\nmonowheel\", but I have since found the same picture in Scientific American for\n1894, where it is described as \"Harper's Unicycle\" implying American origin,\nand there is now no doubt that this invention was the brainchild of Lewis W\nHarper of Minnesota. This is almost certainly the same Harper referred to\nabove.\n\nNote that the drive is transmitted from crank shaft to big wheel by vertical\nshafts and bevel gearing.\n\nPicture courtesy of Ian Bennet.\n\nAbove: The Lewis Harper patent of 1892.\n\nPatent info courtesy of Stephen Ransom\n\nMR JOHN FINCH'S MONOCYCLE\n\nThe Finch Monocycle: 1894\n\nMr Finch called this a monocycle rather tha a monowheel, but it is the same\nthing.\n\nNote the trochoidal shape of the chainwheel, eerily reminiscent of a Wankel\nengine. This was presumably intended to give more constant torque when\npedalling, but it is not mentioned in the text of the patent.\n\nThere are two chain tensioners; surely one would have been enough?\n\nSource: US patent 521,786\n\nTHE SOCIABLE MONOWHEEL\n\nThe Sociable Monowheel: 1896?\n\nIn the early days of cycling, a \"sociable\" was a design carrying two or more\npeople, preferably side-by-side to facilitate conversation.\n\nThe engraving comes from the book \"Bicycles and Tricycles\" by Archibald Sharp,\nan extremely comprehensive work that does not shrink from examining the\nstructural strength of bicycle frames and the kinematics of chainwheels. The\nonly reference to this monowheel in the text baldly calls it: \"a sociable\nmonocycle... for two riders.\" And that's all he wrote.\n\nThe rather crude drawing does not appear to be copied from a photograph, and\nit seemed to me unlikely that such a machine was ever built. The problems of\ntwo people co-ordinating the balancing and steering would be severe.\n\nHowever, Brent Cardani tells me:\n\n\"I found that a sociable monocycle was produced by Pearce in 1881. This is\naccording to \"The History and Development of Cycles\" by C.F. Caunter,\npublished in 1955 \"for the Science Museum by Her Majesty's Stationery Office\".\nAlas, there are no pictures of the contraption, but the description in the\ntext seems to describe exactly what is shown in the picture on your site.\" The\ndates don't match, but maybe Sharp was describing a machine built 15 years\nbefore he was writing.\n\nAn interesting point is that such a machine could only be used with two\nriders- unlike a conventional tandem which can be ridden by one.\n\nSociable Monowheel replica: 2008\n\nThis replica machine has clearly been built from the illustration above.\n\nIt featured in a sales catalogue issued by the Canberra Bicycle Museum in\n2008. The accompanying text was:\n\n\"Tandem Unicycle. Replica built by Wayne Kotzur. Has not been ridden yet. 66.5\ninch wheel, 2 seats. $1000\"\n\nFrankly I'm not surprised it hasn't been ridden; (yet) I would have thought it\nwould require two people with enormous skill and perfect co-ordination to even\nattempt it. There is no mention of an auction, so I assume $1000 was the\npurchase price rather than a reserve price.\n\nWhat the Canberra Bicycle Museum is doing selling items like this instead of\ncurating them, I do not know. It is probably significant that their web\naddress appears to have been taken over by some skeevy gambling site; I have\ntherefore removed the link above.\n\nAN AMERICAN MONOWHEEL: 1897\n\nAn American monowheel: 1897.\n\nThis is the monowheel design of Vernon D Venable, of Farmville, Virginia. It\nconsists of something like a normal bicycle ridden inside the big wheel.\n\nThis picture was originally published in the French scientific journal La\nNature in 1897. It said: \"the inventor affirms that his unicycle is absolutely\nstable, and can be easily steered by a simple inclination of the body to left\nor right\". I admire (but do not share) his confidence. Early monowheels were\nsometimes described as \"unicycles\", but today a unicycle is a relatively small\nwheel with a saddle mounted on a tube extending above it, intended only for\ncircus and recreational use.\n\nPicture courtesy of Henk Schuurih.\n\nAn American monowheel: 1897.\n\nThe mechanical details of Mr Venable's monowheel; note the roller-bearing\nbetween frame and wheel.\n\nPicture courtesy of Henk Schuurih.\n\nThe patent drawing: 1897\n\nPatent number 611,534 was taken out in May 1897. Here the sprocket-and-peg\ndrive to the main wheel can be more clearly seen.\n\nPicture courtesy of Stephen Ransom.\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF THE MONOWHEEL: 1899\n\nThe mathematics of monowheel stability, by Carvallo: 1899\n\nM E Carvallo devoted some space to monowheels in his paper \ufffdTheorie du\nMouvement due Monocycle et de la Bicyclette\ufffd (pub Paris: Gauthier-Villars\n1899)\n\nIt seems highly unlikely that any of the practical monowheel constructors\nstudied this.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
