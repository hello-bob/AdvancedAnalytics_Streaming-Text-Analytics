It contains some spoilers for the\n2024 miniseries Shogun.\n\nThe last few decades have seen a number of unforgettable TV shows whose\nsuccess went beyond good ratings and high viewership \u2014 series that ascended to\nthe strata of cultural touchstones beloved by critics and audiences alike.\nShows like The Sopranos (1999\u20132007), The Wire (2002\u20132008), House (2004\u20132012),\nBreaking Bad (2008\u20132013), and Mad Men (2007\u20132015) captured lightning in a\nbottle at just the right moment and became pop culture giants. But rumors of a\nmodern golden age of television, sometimes called \u201cpeak TV\u201d, have been greatly\nexaggerated.\n\nToday\u2019s media landscape is dominated by an increasing number of streaming\nservices like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video, governed by the\nphilosophy of quantity over quality, and convinced that bad writing,\nunlikeable characters, and cringeworthy virtue signaling can be papered over\nsimply by throwing money at it. In chimp-like fashion, networks and platforms\nfling feces at the wall until something inevitably sticks \u2014 at which point\nthey cancel it prematurely or milk it to the point of mediocrity. Good TV \u2014\ntruly good TV \u2014 the kind that gets you invested beyond I\u2019m bored and need to\nkill time grows harder to find by the year, which is why FX\u2019s Shogun (2024)\nhas been such a breath of fresh air. Without doing anything particularly new\nor surprising, this historical miniseries finds astonishing complexity and\ndrama in its simplicity.\n\nBased on James Clavell\u2019s 1975 novel of the same name, itself a fictionalized\nretelling of real events from feudal Japan, Shogun is an adaptation that is\nboth traditional in the straightforwardness of its storytelling, and modern in\nits attention to historical detail. This isn\u2019t the first Shogun adaptation,\neither. Clavell\u2019s novel was originally made into a miniseries in 1980, one\nthat went on to earn three Golden Globes, three Emmys, and another 11 Emmy\nnominations. This new Shogun had big sandals to fill, which it did \u2014 and then\nsome.\n\nFirst, a little historical context to set the stage. Like medieval Europe,\nJapan had a long period of feudalism defined by the constant bloody power\nstruggles between aristocratic families. Then, in the 1560s, an ambitious dark\nhorse warlord named Oda Nobunaga put Japan on a path toward unification\nthrough a series of ferocious wars. Although Nobunaga was killed before he\ncould finish the process, his lieutenant, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, finally united\nJapan for the first time in 1590. After Hideyoshi\u2019s death, a civil war ensued\nthat saw the influential Tokugawa Ieyasu become the Shogun of all Japan \u2014\neffectively a military dictator ruling on the emperor\u2019s behalf \u2014 beginning a\nperiod of unified rule that would last till the 1800s.\n\nThe Shogun novel and its miniseries adaptation are historical fiction, but\ntheir disguise is paper thin. The charismatic lord Yoshii Toranaga (played by\nHiroyuki Sanada) is a stand-in for Tokugawa, while his chief rival, Ishido\n(Takehiro Hira), represents Tokugawa\u2019s chief rival, Ishida Mitsunari. The show\nportrays a pivotal period of Japanese history, where hard-fought unification\nwas at risk of falling apart, and the long legacy of feudalism threatened to\nreach out from the past and throw the country back into a gruesome cycle of\nviolence.\n\nInto this mix is thrown John Blackthorne (played by Cosmo Jarvis) \u2014 roughly\nbased on the historical figure William Adams, the first Englishman to reach\nJapan. A naval navigator by trade, he washes onto Japanese shores in the year\n1600, and is quickly sucked into the vicious politics of a feudal Japan on the\nbrink of civil war. Blackthorne soon finds himself serving under Toranaga, and\ninvolved in a complicated relationship with his translator, a woman named\nMariko (Anna Sawai).\n\nOne of five regents reigning in the name of the late Shogun\u2019s child heir,\nToranaga is cornered by the crafty lord Ishido and pushed to the precipice of\nlosing not only political power, but his life. Amid this precarious situation,\nPortuguese Catholic missionaries have gained a foothold in the country, and\nhave converted several of the regents. Blackthorne, a Protestant, is thrust\ninto this fray as a wild card, and like a pebble starting a landslide, he\naffects a large causal chain that sets off the main conflict of the story.\n\nBlackthorne is the perfect fish out of water. He\u2019s brash, individualist, and\nprideful in a society where etiquette is everything and the slightest faux pas\ncan spell death. Feudal Japanese culture is shown in all its obsessively\nritualistic glory \u2014 a byzantine labyrinth of excessive formality, an honor\nculture so strict that offense is worth killing \u2014 or dying \u2014 for. But for all\nof his flaws, Blackthorne\u2019s boldness, determination, and willingness to adapt\nto his alien surroundings gains him the respect of his new peers through\nshared adversity.\n\nYoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada) (left). John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis)\n(right).\n\nThe series initially seemed like it would follow many of hackneyed narrative\ntropes common in television these days, with unnecessarily graphic violence,\nand the Portuguese accurately portrayed as predatory colonizers threatening\nJapanese sovereignty. But by the end of the first episode, Shogun relaxes back\ninto a much more traditional mold. Despite the grippingly dramatic twists and\nturns, the story is uncomplicated. Virtually everything we see is the simple\nresult of preceding events. The story holds few surprises, and yet I was glued\nto my screen. And I wasn\u2019t alone. The show drew nine million views in its\nfirst six days alone.\n\nUnlike so many modern films and shows, Shogun has no desperation to break new\nground. It does not contort itself to grasp at some semblance of true\noriginality, or abandon the fundamentals of storytelling in the endless\npursuit of shocking the audience or showing them something they\u2019ve never seen\nbefore. Shogun prizes execution over innovation, excellence over novelty, and\ndramatic elegance over sprawling intrigue.\n\nIn contrast to movies like The Last Samurai (2003), which romanticize samurai\nsociety as deeply honorable, Shogun reveals its more historically accurate\nunderbelly. We see a samurai disembowel himself purely for speaking out of\nturn, a sailor being boiled alive to satisfy the urges of a sadistic feudal\nlord, and a gardener voluntarily kill himself after disobeying a minor order\nfrom his lord. An earthquake kills thousands and everyone just moves on\nwithout much pause. We see a culture of extreme intensity best captured in Dan\nCarlin\u2019s repurposed aphorism, \u201cThe Japanese are just like everybody else \u2014\nonly more so.\u201d*\n\nShogun\u2019s depiction of the feudal Japanese backdrop is raw, brutal, and\nunflattering. Mariko tells Blackthorne, who is distraught by the senselessness\nof the carnage he sees, \u201cWe live and we die. We control nothing beyond that.\u201d\nThe viewer becomes so immersed in the story and setting that Mariko\u2019s\nperspective makes perfect sense in context. The show respects the intellect of\nthe audience by painting, without judgment, an in-depth portrait of a society\nwholly unfamiliar to us. This is what they believe, and this is why they\nbelieve it. Make of it what you will.\n\nSimilarly, Shogun breaks from previous tropes playing into old myths about the\nJapanese being unfamiliar with firearms, or samurai scoffing at muskets and\npreferring the sword. The show demonstrates a concerted effort to accurately\nportray the period it represents, from the ruthless honor culture to the\nfeudal politics, all the way down to details like armor, hair styles,\nclothing, and even speech patterns. It\u2019s a refreshing level of consideration\nfor history seldom seen in period dramas.\n\nHistorical accuracy is nice, of course, but where Shogun truly shines is in\nits character writing, and specifically the ways in which it dodges the\npitfalls of modern media. Mariko is fearless, extremely principled, willing to\ndie for her cause without a second thought, and skilled with weapons. And yet\nwe don\u2019t get even the faintest whiff of the \u201cgirlboss\u201d archetype from her. She\ndoesn\u2019t try to \u201cout-man\u201d or emasculate male characters. She doesn\u2019t speak\ntruth to power or smash the patriarchy. Set beside hollow cutouts like Captain\nMarvel (2019), She Hulk (2022), and the dreadfully revisionist Netflix\n\u201chistorical\u201d docudrama Cleopatra (2023), we see a real woman with more\nstrength than any superhero. Mariko\u2019s antagonist is her childhood friend Lady\nOchiba (played by Akiko Kobayashi). Mother to the child Heir, Ochiba wields\nconsiderable political influence and power over even the scheming lord Ishido,\nand skillfully plays the political game. In a manner true to history, the\nseries shows women as capable, principled, and having agency within their\nsystem \u2014 without projecting 21st-century Ivy League sensibilities onto them.\n\nMariko (Anna Sawai)\n\nIndeed, Shogun steered clear of identity politics altogether. There was no\nbizarre and inexplicable race-swapping, no disregard for source material in\nthe name of political correctness, no burning need to be overly clever or\n\u201ccorrect.\u201d More impressively, the show had the discipline and grace to stay\nself-contained and not overstay its welcome. Shogun sticks to a single,\n10-episode miniseries format, avoiding the inevitable problems that come with\na prolonged story. How many shows have we all watched with outstanding first\nor second seasons that devolved into unwatchable drivel by season four or\nfive? Holding to a shorter span leaves less room for things to go downhill.\nBut most importantly, it doesn\u2019t try anything narratively ambitious, nor is it\ntrying to be brave and bold and challenge society \u2014 it just sticks to telling\nhonest, relatable stories of human beings trapped in extraordinary situations\nbeyond their control. There\u2019s no moral to Shogun. \u201cWe live and we die.\u201d\n\nWe see this moral grayness with the scheming, openly traitorous Yabushige\n(Tadanobu Asano), who is nevertheless perfectly willing to commit ritual\nsuicide if honor calls for it. Likewise, we never get a clear sense of any\nside being more moral than the other. We like Toranaga because he\u2019s\ncharismatic, wise, cunning, and dignified. And honestly, his role couldn\u2019t\nhave been more perfectly cast. On purely aesthetic grounds, Hiroyuki Sanada\u2019s\nface is a landscape of fascinatingly vulpine angles. The viewer begins rooting\nfor him before he\u2019s even uttered a word. But we\u2019re never under the\nmisapprehension that he\u2019s a saint. Ultimately, there\u2019s very little moral\ndifference between Toranaga and his rival Ishido \u2014 both are feudal lords vying\nfor power using every dirty trick in the book. Toranaga may be likable, but he\nsacrifices several people important to him to reach his goals. He does not do\nit lightly or callously \u2014 but when the chips are down, he\u2019s ready and willing.\nIt\u2019s a situation that invites the viewer to think, rather than a narrative\nwith a clear hero and villain.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about Shogun is not just the sharp cultural contrasts of\nthe brutal, hierarchical society of feudal Japan, but also the presence of\ncultural universals. When John has a drink-off with Buntaro (Shinnosuke Abe),\nMariko\u2019s demanding and cruel husband, it has a sort of timeless masculine\nenergy to it \u2014 two men competing in the kind of petty pissing contest that\napparently knows no cultural boundaries. Likewise, there\u2019s something broadly\nfamiliar in Toranaga\u2019s son Nagakado (Yuki Kura), a brash teenager\noverzealously trying to prove his manhood by talking big and posturing about\nhonor, all the while coming across as entirely fake. Whether you live in\nmodern society or feudal Japan, teenage boys are still poseurs trying on shoes\nthree times too big and pretending they fit.\n\nShogun is not without its shortcomings. The second half has pacing issues, and\nthe central character John Blackthorne seems to disappear for stretches. The\nshow gets a little too dark in parts, and viewers could be forgiven for\nwishing there was slightly more action. The ending, faithful to the novel,\nleaves events somewhat unsatisfyingly unresolved, rendering the story a sort\nof slice of life of 1600 Japan. But the series is nevertheless made with a\nsincerity and passion for the craft that has become all too rare.\n\nShogun proves something that much of modern media seems to have forgotten:\nmoney alone cannot make a good story \u2014 it takes competence, vision, and above\nall else, good writing. By simply sticking to what works without trying to\nreinvent the wheel, and by finding complexity in simplicity through the lens\nof character relationships, Shogun transcends the overly grisly, gory,\ngrimdark \u201crealism\u201d of shows like Game of Thrones (2011\u20132019). I didn\u2019t expect\nto find in it one of the best historical adaptations I\u2019ve ever seen, but\nShogun turned out to be a pleasant surprise. TV producers should take note.\n\nSee also: \u201cStealth Editing a Culture\u201d\n\nShare\n\nAmerican Dreaming is a reader-supported publication.
