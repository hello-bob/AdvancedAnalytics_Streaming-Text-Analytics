Through this unique approach, researchers\ncan study the exchange of blood, hormones, and other substances between the\ntwo organisms, allowing for the examination of a wide range of physiological\nphenomena and interactions. Parabiosis has been employed in various fields of\nstudy, including stem cell research, endocrinology, aging research, and\nimmunology.\n\n## Physiology[edit]\n\n### Parabiotic experiments[edit]\n\nLeft: A headless Cecropia Moth joined with a pupa of the Polyphemus silkworm.\nRight: The abdomen of a Cecropia moth joined with a Cecropia pupa\n\nParabiosis combines two living organisms which are joined surgically and\ndevelop single, shared physiological systems.^[1]^[2] Researchers can prove\nthat the feedback system in one animal is circulated and affects the second\nanimal via blood and plasma exchange.\n\nParabiotic experiments were pioneered by Paul Bert in the mid-1800s. He\npostulated that surgically connected animals could share a circulatory system.\nBert was awarded the Prize of Experimental Physiology of the French Academy of\nScience in 1866 for his discoveries.^[3]\n\nOne limitation of the experiments is that outbred rats cannot be used because\nit can lead to a significant loss of pairs due to intoxication of the blood\nsupply from a dissimilar rat.^[4]\n\n### Discovery of leptin and the role of the hypothalamus in obesity[edit]\n\nMany of the parabiotic experiments since 1950 involve research regarding\nmetabolism. One of these experiments was published in 1959 by G. R. Hervey in\nthe Journal of Physiology. This experiment supported the theory that damage to\nthe hypothalamus, particularly the ventromedial hypothalamus, leads to obesity\ncaused by the overconsumption of food. The study's rats were from the same\nlitter, which had been a closed colony for multiple years. The two rats in\neach pair had no more than a 3% difference in weight. Rats were paired at four\nweeks old. Unpaired rats were used as controls. The rats were conjoined in\nthree ways. In early experiments, the peritoneal cavities were opened and\nconnected between the two rats. In later experiments, to avoid the risk of\ntangling the two rats\u2019 intestines together, smaller cuts were made. After\nfurther refinement of the experimental procedure, the abdominal cavities were\nnot opened, and the rats were conjoined at the hip bone with minimal cutting.\nTo prove that the two animals were sharing blood, researchers injected dye\ninto one rat's veins, and the pigment would show up in the conjoined rat.\n\nIn each pair, one rat became obese and exhibited hyperphagia. The weight of\nthe rat with the surgical lesion rose rapidly for a few months, then reached a\nplateau as a direct result of the surgical procedure. After the procedure, the\nrat with the impaired hypothalamus ate voraciously while the paired rat's\nappetite decreased. The paired rat became obviously thin throughout the\nexperiment, even rejecting food when it was offered.^[5]^[6]\n\nLater studies identified this satiety factor as the adipose-derived hormone\nleptin. Many hormones and metabolites were proven not to be the satiety factor\nthat caused one rat to starve in the experiments. Leptin seemed like a viable\ncandidate. Starting in 1977, Ruth B.S. Harris, a graduate student under\nHervey, repeated previous studies about parabiosis in rats and mice. Due to\nthe discovery of leptin, she analyzed leptin concentrations of the mice in the\nparabiotic experiments. After injecting leptin into each pair's obese mouse,\nshe found that leptin circulated between the conjoined animals, but the\ncirculation of leptin took some time to reach equilibrium. As a result of the\ninjections, the almost immediate weight loss resulted in the parabiotic pairs\ndue to increased inhibition. Approximately 50\u201370% of fat was lost in pairs.\nThe obese mouse lost only fat. The lean mouse lost muscle mass and fat. Harris\nconcluded that leptin levels are increased in obese animals, but other factors\ncould also affect them. Also, leptin was determined to decrease fat storage in\nboth obese and thin animals.^[4]\n\nEarly parabiotic experiments also included cancer research. One study,\npublished in 1966 by Friedell, studied radiation's effects with X-rays on\novarian tumors. To study the tumors, two adult female rats were conjoined. The\nleft rat was shielded, and the right rat was exposed to high levels of\nradiation. The rats were given a controlled amount of food and water. 149 of\n328 pairs showed possible ovarian tumors in the irradiated animals, but not in\ntheir partners. This result matched previous studies of single rats.^[7]\n\n### Aging research[edit]\n\nSee also: Young blood transfusion\n\nChronic diseases of age are studied by conjoining an older animal with a\nyounger animal. Known as heterochronic parabiosis, this process has been used\nin studies to investigate the age-related and disease-related changes in the\ncomposition of the blood, especially plasma proteome.^[8] This process could\nbe used to research cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and\nAlzheimer's disease. As animals age, their oligodendrocytes reduce in\nefficiency, resulting in decreased myelination, causing negative effects on\nthe central nervous system (CNS). Julia Ruckh and fellow researchers have used\nparabiosis to study remyelination from adult stem cells to see if conjoining\nyoung with older mice could reverse or delay this process. The two mice were\nconjoined in the experiment, and demyelination was induced via injection into\nthe older mice. The experiment determined that the younger mice's factors\nreversed CNS demyelination in older mice by revitalizing the oligodendrocytes.\nThe monocytes from the younger mice also enhanced the older mice's ability to\nclear myelin debris because the young monocytes can clear lipids from myelin\nsheaths more effectively than older monocytes. The conjoining of the two\nanimals reversed the effects of age on the myelination cells. The ability of\nthe young mouse's cells was unaffected. Enhanced immunity from the younger\nmouse also promoted the general health of the older mouse in each pair. The\nresults of this experiment could lead to therapy processes for people with\ndemyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis.^[9]^[3]\n\n### Natural examples[edit]\n\nThe term is also applicable to spontaneously occurring conditions such as in\nconjoined twins.^[10]\n\nObligate parasitic reproduction of Anglerfish of the family Ceratiidae, in\nwhich the circulatory systems of the males and females unite completely.\nWithout the attachment of males to females, the endocrine functions cannot\nmature; the individuals fail to develop properly and die young and without\nreproducing.^[11]\n\nPlants growing closely together roots or stems in intimate contact sometimes\nform natural grafts. In parasitic plants such as mistletoe and dodder the\nhaustoria unite the circulatory systems of the host and the parasite so\nintimately that parasitic twiners such as Cassytha may act as vectors carrying\ndisease organisms from one host plant to another.^[12]\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n### Social organisms sharing nests[edit]\n\nCrematogaster modiglianii and Camponotus rufifemur ants sharing a nest\n\nAnt colonies can share their nests with essentially unrelated species of ants.\nThey did not obviously share anything beyond the nests' upkeep, even\nsegregating their brood, so these were very surprising observations; most ants\nare radically intolerant of intruders, usually including even intruders of\ntheir own species.\n\nIn the early 20th century Auguste-Henri Forel coined the term \"parabiosis\" for\nsuch associations, and it was adopted by the likes of William Morton\nWheeler.^[13]^[14] Furthermore, there is evidence for the partitioning of\nfunctions of work between the two species in the nest.^[15] Early reports that\nparabiotic ant colonies forage and feed together peacefully also have been\nqualified by observations that revealed ants of one species in such an\nassociation aggressively displacing members of the other species from\nartificially provided food, while also profiting by following their\nrecruitment trails to new food sources.^[14] Benefits from shared nest defence\nand maintenance even when there is neither direct cooperation nor interaction\nbetween the two associated populations in a nest.^[16]\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\nParabiosis derives most directly from Neo-Latin,^[10] but the Latin in turn\nderives from two classical Greek roots. The first is \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac (para) for \"beside\"\nor \"next to\". In modern etymology, this root appears in various senses, such\nas \"close to\", \"outside of\", and \"different\".\n\n  * In the physiological sense of \"parabiosis,\" \"para\" apparently was intended to mean \"next to.\"\n  * In describing transiently inactive physiological states, \"para\" apparently meant \"outside of.\"\n  * In ecological usage, the word was coined by the entomologist Auguste-Henri Forel as an analog to \"symbiosis,\" also in the sense of \"next to.\" However, in this case, the emphasis was in contrast to \"together\" (\"sym-\").\n\nThe second classical Greek root from which the Latin derives is \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 (bios),\nmeaning \"life.\"\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Commensalism\n  * Mutualism (biology)\n  * Symbiosis\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Biju Parekkadan & Martin L.
