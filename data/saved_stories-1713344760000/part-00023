Ago\n\nJeff Cox@jeff.cox.7528@JeffCoxCNBCcom\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy has not seen inflation come back to the central bank\u2019s goal, pointing to the further unlikelihood that interest rate cuts are in the offing anytime soon.\n  * \u201cThe recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate that it\u2019s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,\u201d he said during a central banking forum.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following\na closed two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate\npolicy at the Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 13, 2023.\n\nKevin Lamarque | Reuters\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. economy, while\notherwise strong, has not seen inflation come back to the central bank\u2019s goal,\npointing to the further unlikelihood that interest rate cuts are in the offing\nanytime soon.\n\nSpeaking to a policy forum focused on U.S.-Canada economic relations, Powell\nsaid that while inflation continues to make its way lower, it hasn\u2019t moved\nquickly enough, and the current state of policy should remain intact.\n\n\u201cMore recent data shows solid growth and continued strength in the labor\nmarket, but also a lack of further progress so far this year on returning to\nour 2% inflation goal,\u201d the Fed chief said during a panel talk.\n\nEchoing recent statements by central bank officials, Powell indicated the\ncurrent level of policy likely will stay in place until inflation gets closer\nto target.\n\nSince July 2023, the Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate in a target\nrange between 5.25%-5.5%, the highest in 23 years. That was the result of 11\nconsecutive rate hikes that began in March 2022.\n\n\u201cThe recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead\nindicate that it\u2019s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that\nconfidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, we think policy is well positioned to handle\nthe risks that we face.\u201d\n\nPowell added that until inflation shows more progress, \u201cWe can maintain the\ncurrent level of restriction for as long as needed.\u201d\n\nThe comments follow inflation data through the first three months of 2024 that\nhas been higher than expected. A consumer price index reading for March,\nreleased last week, showed inflation running at a 3.5% annual rate \u2014 well off\nthe peak around 9% in mid-2022 but drifting higher since October 2023.\n\nTreasury yields rose as Powell spoke. The benchmark 2-year note, which is\nespecially sensitive to Fed rate moves, briefly topped 5%, while the benchmark\n10-year yield rose 3 basis points. The S&P 500 wavered after Powell\u2019s remarks,\nbriefly turning negative on the day before recovering.\n\nU.S. 10 Year Treasury\n\nUS10Y:Tradeweb\n\n4.668%+0.011\n\nYield | 12:00 AM EDT\n\n10-year and 2-year yields\n\nPowell noted the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption\nexpenditures price index, showed core inflation at 2.8% in February and has\nbeen little changed over the past few months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said at the [Federal Open Market Committee] that we\u2019ll need greater\nconfidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2% before [it will be]\nappropriate to ease policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recent data have clearly not given\nus greater confidence and instead indicate that it\u2019s likely to take longer\nthan expected to achieve that confidence.\u201d\n\nFinancial markets have had to reset their expectations for rate cuts this\nyear. At the start of 2024, traders in the fed funds futures market were\npricing in six or seven cuts this year, starting in March. As the data has\nprogressed, the expectations have shifted to one or two reductions, assuming\nquarter percentage point moves, and not starting until September.\n\nIn their most recent update, FOMC officials in March indicated they see three\ncuts this year. However, several policymakers in recent days have stressed the\ndata-dependent nature of policy and have not committed to set level of\nreductions.\n\nCorrection: Powell\u2019s comments follow inflation data through the first three\nmonths of 2024 that has been higher than expected. An earlier version\nmisstated the year.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Friday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Boeing, First Solar, Schwab & more\n  * Citi says this \u2018high risk\u2019 but \u2018attractive\u2019 global stock has 280% upside\n  * This AI stock could fall 50% and has an \u2018exaggerated artificial intelligence narrative,\u2019 Morningstar says\n  * Morgan Stanley names 3 overlooked global tech stocks, giving one almost 100% upside\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
