As an\nalternative app distribution portal for Android, you can download many popular\napps without having to create or use a Google Account or submit to the\nsurveillance-style tracking of Google Play.\n\nF-Droid distribution is a popular request among many members of the Proton\ncommunity, and we\u2019re excited that Android users can now secure their passwords\nand digital identity without having to hand over any personal data if they\ndon\u2019t want to. This is our second app to be distributed via F-Droid after the\nrelease of the Proton VPN Android APK(new window) a few years ago.\n\nDownload Proton Pass on F-Droid\n\nOf course, Proton Pass will continue to be available on the Play Store, as\nthis is where most Android users prefer to get their apps. You can also\ndownload any Proton app from our Proton Apps page(new window) if you don\u2019t\nwant to use a third-party app store. Above all, we want to make sure everyone\nhas the freedom to make their own choices rather than be locked into the\ndecisions of a small number of dominant tech companies.\n\n## Why F-Droid?\n\nOne of the biggest problems on the internet right now is the monopoly held by\njust a few companies on app distribution. Google and Apple use this\nstranglehold on software to protect their own products, stifle innovation, and\nlevy high arbitrary fees against independent developers. Unfortunately they\nare continuing this strategy even with password managers(new window), trying\nto leverage your login method as another way to trap you inside their walled\ngarden.\n\nF-Droid is quite different. As an app repository maintained by volunteers,\nthey are not motivated by profit but rather promoting online privacy and\nfreedom. F-Droid lets you download privacy-focused, open source apps for\nAndroid, many of which they have in fact rebuilt from the source to ensure\nthere are no backdoors or hidden trackers. Open source apps give you\nconfidence that the software is secure and that it does what the developer\nclaims.\n\nAll the apps on F-Droid are free, including Proton Pass, which offers\nunlimited logins. You can also upgrade to a paid subscription to support our\nmission and to get extra features like vault sharing with up to 10 people,\nintegrated two-factor authenticator, and unlimited hide-my-email aliases.\n\nWhenever possible, we strive to publish our apps on F-Droid to support those\nwho, like us, believe a better, more private and transparent internet is\npossible.\n\nLearn more about F-Droid(new window)\n\n## Continuing the Proton Pass journey\n\nIn less than a year since we launched our password manager, we\u2019ve rapidly\nbuilt out new features and native apps. Proton Pass is now available on our\nweb app, browser extensions, Android, iOS, and Windows. Apps for Mac and Linux\nare on the way.\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve introduced important features like passkeys(new window)\nsupport, which gives you the freedom to choose the most secure authentication\nmethod for your accounts. And we also introduced Proton Pass for Business(new\nwindow) to make it easier for teams to secure their data in the face of rising\nattacks on businesses. As more people signed up for Pass, we even lowered our\npricing(new window) to pass our savings from economies of scale on to our\ncommunity. Everything we do is a reflection of our values and our mission to\nincrease access to privacy, security, and freedom globally. This is possible\nnot because of venture capital investors or advertisers \u2014 we have neither \u2014\nbut because of you, our community of supporters who share our vision.
