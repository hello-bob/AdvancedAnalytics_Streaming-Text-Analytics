What do they have in common? RFID tags.\n\nEvery RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag contains a computer chip and a\ntiny metal strip of an antenna. A cool 18bn of these are made \u2013 and disposed\nof \u2013 each year. And with demands for product traceability increasing,\nironically in part because of concerns for the social and environmental health\nof the supply chain, that\u2019s set to soar.\n\nAnd guess where most of these tags end up? Yup, landfill \u2013 adding to the\nburgeoning volumes of e-waste polluting our soils, rivers and skies. It\u2019s a\nsorry tale, but it\u2019s one in which two young graduates of Imperial College\nLondon are putting a great big green twist. Under the name of PulpaTronics,\nChloe So and Soma Biro reckon they\u2019ve hit on a beguilingly simple sounding\nsolution: make the tags out of paper. No plastic, no chips, no metal strips.\nJust paper, pure and ... simple ... ? Well, not quite, as we shall see.\n\nFrom left to right, Jan Patrick Schulz, CEO of Landbell Group and creator of\nthe Green Alley Award, Soma Biro \u2013 CTO at PulpaTronics \u2013 and Chloe So, the\nstartup's CEO.

If\nyou can get rid of those, as Soma explains, you solve the e-waste problem at a\nstroke. But getting rid of things isn\u2019t the typical approach to technical\nsolutions, he adds. \u201cI read a paper in Nature that set out how humans have a\nbias for solving problems through addition \u2013 by adding something new, rather\nthan removing complexity, even if that\u2019s the best approach.\u201d\n\nAnd adding stuff to a world already stuffed, as it were, can create more\nproblems than it solves. \u201cSo that became one of the guiding principles of\nPulpaTronics\u201d, he says: stripping things down \u201cto the bare minimum, where they\nare still functional, but have as low an environmental impact as possible\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a passion that Hungarian-born Biro, PulaTronics\u2019 CTO, shares with co-\nfounder and CEO, So. Growing up in Hong Kong and then spending time in the US,\nshe worked in a venture capital accelerator for a few years and developed \u201ca\nfascination for using waste materials to create new products\u201d. One of her\nfirst inspirations was actually a previous Green Alley Award winner,\nAeropowder, which scooped the prize in 2018 for using chicken feathers to\ncreate thermal packaging. \u201cWhen I found out what they were doing, I was like:\n\u2018Whoa! That is so cool!\u2019\u201d.\n\n> E-waste is such a big issue, but it\u2019s also so unseen. It\u2019s not like a\n> plastic bag\n\nSo speaks at the speed of innovation, her words tumbling over themselves with\nan infectious enthusiasm. Biro, by contrast, is measured, precise. They make a\ngood pair. They met on their first day at Imperial\u2019s celebrated Innovation\nDesign Engineering double master\u2019s programme, which is run jointly with the\nRoyal College of Art. PulpaTronics started as a piece of project work, where\nthey focused on the small matter of \u201cmaterial and technology-based solutions\nthat can reduce the human impact on the planet\u201d. Delving into research papers,\nexploring possible applications of nascent tech, says So, they narrowed their\nsearch down to \u201csomething that is biodegradable, and has to do with\nelectronics ... E-waste is such a big issue, but it\u2019s also so unseen. It\u2019s not\nlike a plastic bag.\u201d Zeroing in on RFID tags was a way of bringing it to\nlight, she explains.\n\nBut just how did they achieve this magical simplification? The answer lies in\nlasers: these turn the paper into a conductive material, Biro explains,\nprinting a pattern on the surface that can be \u2018read\u2019 by a scanner, rather like\na QR code. It sounds like frontier technology, but it works, and PulpaTronics\nhave patents pending to protect it.\n\nThe resulting tag comes in two forms: in one, there is still a microchip, so\nthat it can be read by existing scanners of the sort common within retailers,\nfor example. The more advanced version does away with the chip altogether.\nThis will need a different kind of scanner, currently in development, which\nPulpaTronics envisages issuing licences for others to manufacture.\n\nMore than 18bn single-use RFID tags are made each year. PulpaTronics' paper-\nbased version eliminates metal and streamlines recycling.

Then there are the carbon\nsavings: up to 70% for the chipless version \u2013 so a no-brainer from a\nsustainability viewpoint too. All the same, industry interest was slow to\nstart with but when PulpaTronics won a coveted Dezeen magazine award in late\n2023, it snowballed, says So. Big brands such as UPS, DHL, Marks & Spencer and\nCoca-Cola came calling. \u201cWe were just bombarded.\u201d Brands were fascinated by\nthe innovation, she says, but even more by the price point, \u201cbecause, like any\nbusiness, the knew that green products can\u2019t come with a premium\u201d.\n\nNow So and Biro are deep in every startup\u2019s familiar flurry of fundraising and\ntech development \u2013 but buoyed by the waves of enthusiasm their work has\ncreated, not least among the judging panel of the Green Alley Award. Its\nchair, Landbell CEO Jan Patrick Schulz, praised their \u201cfuture-proof solution\u201d,\ndescribing PulpaTronics as \u201ca true pioneer\u201d.\n\nAnd like all pioneers, they\u2019re not standing still. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand\nacross materials\u201d, says So. \u201cWe started with paper, but it could be\nbioplastics next.\u201d But one thing won\u2019t change, she insists, and that\u2019s their\ncommitment to sustainability. \u201cThroughout, we want to make sure that whatever\nwe do, we\u2019re doing it right.\u201d\n\nMain image: PulpaTronics\n\n## Related articles\n\nPositive.News | Partners\n\nThis company makes cosmetics packaging materials that leave no microplastics\nbehind Finnish startup Sulapac is creating packaging that's as circular as it\nis beautiful Written in partnership with Green Alley Award\n\nPositive.News | Partners\n\nDebunking junk: 10 years of rethinking rubbish Some horizon-expanding\ncompanies have won plaudits from the Green Alley Award in its 10 years to\ndate, altering how we think of waste Written in partnership with Green Alley\nAward\n\nPositive.News | Partners\n\nThe waste-busters: six European companies on a mission to design out waste\nSome ingenious ideas are vying for the Green Alley Award this year Written in\npartnership with Green Alley Award\n\nSubscribe to Positive News magazine\n\n  * Green Alley Award\n  * Partners\n  * RFID tags\n\n  * Society\n  * Environment\n  * Lifestyle\n  * Science\n  * Economics\n  * Opinion\n\n  * About Positive News\n  * Contact us\n  * Customer FAQs\n  * Our policies\n  * Terms and conditions\n  * Rules of the society\n\n  * Partners\n  * Become a supporter\n  * Positive News magazine\n  * My account\n  * Stock magazine\n  * Careers\n\nGet our newsletterGet Positive News stories in your inbox each week\n\nWebsite: Atomic Smash\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Positive News.
