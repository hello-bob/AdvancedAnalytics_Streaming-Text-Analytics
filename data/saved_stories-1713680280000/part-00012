Thanks to the so-called\ninternet-of-things, your iPhone can sync with your dishwasher, and thanks to\nNeuralink, in the not-too-distant future will sync with your mind. You can\nsummon a chatbot to solve business problems, or use Microsoft Copilot to help\nyou with a coding project. GPT-4 can produce prose of a high enough quality\nthat it threatens to make make journalists obsolete.\n\nEvery major tech company such as Alphabet, Apple, and Meta are in an arms race\nto launch the next great AI tool that will radically change and disrupt\nbusiness in ways never before thought possible and unlocking untold windfalls\nof economic productivity in the process. Everyday hundreds of articles are\nuploaded to arXiv about progress in this field. It\u2019s dizzying trying to keep\nup with it all.\n\nYet this is juxtaposed with an epidemic of Enshittification, \u201ca term coined by\nwriter Cory Doctorow in November 2022 to describe a pattern of decreasing\nquality observed in online services and products,\u201d but the concept is just as\napplicable to the offline world, too. It\u2019s not your imagination\u2013in spite of\nall this progress in AI and other technologies\u2013many things still seem shitty\nor do not work, whether it\u2019s new appliances that break easily or USB\nconnectors that fail, particularly USB-C cables, which thanks to the short\nconnection profile are prone to breaking compared to the more sturdy older USB\ncables. Why can\u2019t some of this brainpower that is being used to make better\nchatbots or device-syncing also be summoned to making products that are more\nreliable or better?\n\nLike, in spite of increasingly advanced language models, why are we still\nstuck with leaky and useless cup lids, condiment packets that squirt on your\nclothes , or wobbly tables and chairs that need wadded-up napkins to\nstabilize. Or plastic utensils that are liable to snapping at even the\nslightest overapplication of force. Yes, in spite of GPT-4, the only solution\nto wobbly furniture is napkins, not better furniture. Why do stamps still\nexist? Why cannot anyone disrupt those industries? Why can\u2019t the big brains in\ntech make better condiment packets or tables that do not wobble? Compared to\nseemingly quotidian developments in AI, the most notable recent innovation out\nof the condiments industry in decades, AFIK, are those ketchup bottles with\nthe large flat tops, so the bottles can be stood upside-down to allow for the\nketchup to collect without having to shake the bottle. Yes, this was a big\nenough deal that people are still talking about it.\n\nPart of the problem is simple problems are not uncommonly surprisingly hard to\nfix. For developers, what is supposed to be a \u2018simple coding problem\u2019 can\nsometimes turn into a multi-hour slog\u2013ask anyone who has tried to align CSS\ntables to work perfectly on all browsers. Regarding wobbly tables, it does not\nhelp that people are lazy: when they stand up or sit down, they lean or press\ntheir often obese or overweight bodies on the table to get leverage, causing\nthe weaker parts to slightly warp or deform due to metal fatigue over many\nyears by thousands of people. Even if the table is structurally strong, the\nhinges and soldering are the weak points. Trying to overengineer a table is\nnot economically viable.\n\nCompanies make more money by consumers having to frequently replace breakage-\nprone products after some predictable amount of time has elapsed, known as\nplanned obsolescence. If durable goods cost half as much but break three times\nas often, this is like another hidden tax or hidden form of inflation that may\nbe overlooked by the \u2018official\u2019 CPI stats. It\u2019s not an accident your stuff\nbreaks: it\u2019s a message that it\u2019s time to replace your refrigerator with one\nthat has an even bigger ice cube maker, or a phone with a slightly higher\nresolution camera and a few extra gigabytes of storage. Same for mandatory\nrecurring subscriptions, such as a $20/month fee so your smart appliance can\n\u2018locate itself\u2019.\n\nAlso, blame economic incentives and consumer preferences for the persistence\nof crappy old technology. Door technology largely has not changed in a hundred\nyears, in large part because there is little money in making better doors, and\nconsumers don\u2019t care that much either. The coffee shops I patronize are still\nfull of people even with wobbly tables and chairs. Consumer preferences tend\nto be inelastic for small things, unlike agonizing over college choices or\ncomparison shopping for a new car. Unlike AI, no company or VC firm is going\nto get a trillion-dollar valuation or a lucrative exit by designing better\nketchup packets or thumbprint or iris-activated doors like in science fiction.\nHere\u2019s to our AI-enhanced but still breakage-prone and wobbly-furniture\nfuture.\n\nPublished April 12, 2024By smartistone\n\nCategorized as Uncategorized\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n## Pages\n\n## Archives\n\n## Archives\n\nGrey Enlightenment\n\nProudly powered by WordPress.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
