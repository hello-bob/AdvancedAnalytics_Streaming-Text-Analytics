He's been working on it for a while\nbut it's not ready for use yet. He said he'll either have to pay a lawyer or\nfind a qualified volunteer to get the text into shape.\n\n\"There are probably terms that won't work at all, and things that would have\nto be written better to be upheld by a court,\" he says.\n\nThe license is one component among several \u2013 the paid license needs to be\nhammered out \u2013 that he hopes will support his proposed Post-Open paradigm to\nhelp software developers get paid when their work gets used by large\ncorporations.\n\n\"There are two paradigms that you can use for this,\" he explains in an\ninterview. \"One is Spotify and the other is ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. The\ndifference is that Spotify is a for-profit corporation. And they have to\ndistribute profits to their stockholders before they pay the musicians. And as\na result, the musicians complain that they're not getting very much at all.\"\n\nPerens wants his new license \u2013 intended to complement open source licensing\nrather than replace it \u2013 to be administered by a 501(c)(6) non-profit. This\nentity would handle payments to developers.\n\nHe points to the music performing rights organizations as a template, although\namong ASCAP, BMI, SECAC, and GMR, only ASCAP remains non-profit. BMI announced\nplans to become a for-profit business in 2022, and subsequently reduced\npayouts to musicians before being sold in November 2023 to a private equity\nfirm. And that's to say nothing about the antitrust consent decrees that\ncontinue to bind ASCAP and BMI.\n\nThe basic idea is companies making more than $5 million annually by using\nPost-Open software in a paid-for product would be required to pay 1 percent of\ntheir revenue back to this administrative organization, which would distribute\nthe funds to the maintainers of the participating open source project(s). That\nwould cover all Post-Open software used by the organization.\n\n\"The license that I have written is long \u2013 about as long as the Affero GPL 3,\nwhich is now 17 years old, and had to deal with a lot more problems than the\nearly licenses,\" Perens explains. \"So, at least my license isn't excessively\nlong. It handles all of the abuses of developers that I'm conscious of,\nincluding things I was involved in directly like Open Source Security v.\nPerens, and Jacobsen v. Katzer.\"\n\n\"It also makes compliance easier for companies than it is today, and probably\ncheaper even if they do have to pay. It creates an entity that can sue\ninfringers on behalf of any developer and gets the funding to do it, but I'm\nplanning the infringement process to forgive companies that admit the problem\nand cure the infringement, so most won't ever go to court.\n\n\"It requires more infrastructure than open source developers are used to.\nThere's a central organization for Post-Open (or it could be three\norganizations if we divided all of the purposes: apportioning money to\ndevelopers, running licensing, and enforcing compliance), and an outside CPA\nfirm, and all of that has to be structured so that developers can trust it.\"\n\nIn 2020 Perens resigned from the Open Source Initiative, the non-profit\noverseeing the OSD, when the organization was considering whether to give its\nblessing to the Cryptographic Autonomy License because he believed it wasn't\n\"freedom respecting.\"\n\n  * Law prof predicts generative AI will die at the hands of watchdogs\n  * US government reportedly ponders crimping China's use of RISC-V\n  * Open sourcerers say suspected xz-style attacks continue to target maintainers\n  * Open source versus Microsoft: The new rebellion begins\n\nHe has since come to believe that open source licensing has created its own\nset of problems. Perens points to the XZ Affair, in which the overburdened\nmaintainer of the XZ suite of compression tools was pressured to allow a\npseudonymous contributor, assumed to be part of a nation-state hacking effort,\nto install backdoor code that was detected only by chance.\n\n\"So why did that happen?\" Perens says. \"Because the developer was perfectly\ncapable of creating the XZ software, but not of supporting all of the world's\nrichest corporations for exactly nothing for the rest of his life. And so we\nhave to pay those developers both to support the companies that use the\nsoftware and to provide some balance to a situation that's become very\nunbalanced.\"\n\nThe lack of balance can be seen in the way that companies attempting to\ncommercialize open source projects, like HashiCorp, Elastic, Neo4j, MongoDB,\nRedis, and Sentry, have moved away from open source licenses. They've done so\nto shield themselves from tech giants like Amazon that have a computing\ninfrastructure cost advantage when it comes to offering open source software\nas a service.\n\nMark Collier, COO of the OpenInfra Foundation, doesn't see a problem with open\nsource.\n\n\"I don't agree that there's a crisis in open source licensing,\" he tells The\nRegister. \"I think that there are many challenges that certainly are\ncontinuously coming up when it comes to different companies trying to figure\nout how they want to monetize and how they want to engage with open source.\"\n\nHe acknowledges that companies like HashiCorp have backed away from open\nsource licensing. \"But I don't know that any of those have been successful,\"\nhe says. \"I think there's a lot of evidence that they haven't been\nsuccessful.\"\n\nAsked about Perens's argument that open source developers aren't being fairly\ncompensated for their work, Collier is less emphatic.\n\n\"I think that 'fair' is ... a very charged word, and it's sort of subjective\nby its very nature,\" he says. \"So it's hard to have a yes or no answer to\nthat. Personally, what I see as fundamental when it comes to free and open\nsource software is freedom.\"\n\nBut freedom isn't really the issue Perens is trying to address, unless we're\ntalking about freedom from compensation. He's concerned about how the\nfinancial aspects of open source can leave projects begging for support and\nsusceptible to subversion. He's concerned about wealthy corporates profiting\nfrom free labor.\n\nThat's one reason the Post-Open license covers co-opting content to train\nmachine learning models.\n\n\"The problem with AI is I pretty much think all AI is copyright infringement\nat this point,\" says Perens. \"They're reading people's copyrighted web\ncontent, they're reading open source, etc. And what AI really does is it mixes\nand matches its input. So what you are getting as the output of an AI is\nsomeone else's copyrighted content that is maybe not directly identifiable\nbecause of the mix and match.\n\n\"But it's infringement and that needs to be solved and there are a whole bunch\nof court cases going on. So I think that that'll be solved at that level. But\nat the open source or Post-Open level, we just say no, don't train your model\nwith this. Because it's not a fair use. It's not compensating the developers\nat all.\"\n\nPerens's to-do list remains long. He still has to write the paid license, the\noperating agreement, and the infringement process. He says he also needs to\nhave a legal review done to avoid antitrust concerns. And he's looking for\ncommunity support.\n\n\"So, can I do this third impossible thing and sell Post-Open to the world?\" he\nsays. \"The good news is that I'm still not getting significant pushback, and\nI'm getting enthusiastic help from some people. But I suspect a lot still\ndon't believe that this can happen. If we go back to the genesis of open\nsource, no lawyer would talk to us and we were anathema to the corporate\nworld. We got past that, so I'm confident that we can make progress with Post-\nOpen today.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * FOSS\n  * Law\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * FOSS\n  * Law\n  * Open Source\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Antitrust\n  * API\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Confluence\n  * Cross-border data flow\n  * Database\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Digital Services Act\n  * FOSDEM\n  * Git\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * IDE\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Linux\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Privacy Shield\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * Wikipedia\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Richard Stallman\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * FOSS\n  * Law\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * FOSS\n  * Law\n  * Open Source\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Antitrust\n  * API\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Confluence\n  * Cross-border data flow\n  * Database\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Digital Services Act\n  * FOSDEM\n  * Git\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * IDE\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Linux\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Privacy Shield\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * Wikipedia\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Richard Stallman\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Miracle-WM tiling window manager for Mir hits 0.2.0\n\nWhat are Mir and Wayland all about anyway?\n\nSoftware7 days | 14\n\n#### Debian spices up APT package manager with a dash of color, squishes\nancient bug\n\n2.9 gives a taste of what's to come\n\nOSes12 days | 39\n\n#### Law prof predicts generative AI will die at the hands of watchdogs\n\nVideo Big tech backlash and animus against the machines will invite stifling\nred tape\n\nAI + ML6 days | 21\n\n#### Java thriving after 30 years\n\nWhy OpenJDK is as important as ever in the big picture of IT\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Microsoft dusts off ancient MS-DOS 4.0 code for release on GitHub\n\nNobody's favorite operating system is now available for inspection\n\nOffbeat4 days | 98\n\n#### Apple releases OpenELM, a slightly more accurate LLM\n\nIt's not the fastest machine learning model, but you can't have everything\n\nAI + ML6 days | 9\n\n#### Turns out teaching criminals to write web code keeps them out of prison\n\nThe software redemption\n\nDevops5 days | 29\n\n#### NetBSD 10 proves old tech can still kick apps and take names three\ndecades later\n\nFOSDEM 2024 Proper old-school Unix, not like those lazy, decadent Linux types\n\nOSes13 days | 39\n\n#### AlmaLinux 9.4 beta prepares to tread where RHEL dares not\n\nCIQ also has an alternative approach to compatible kernels with RockyLinux\n\nOSes13 days | 6\n\n#### OpenAI's GPT-4 can exploit real vulnerabilities by reading security\nadvisories\n\nWhile some other LLMs appear to flat-out suck\n\nAI + ML13 days | 6\n\n#### The hyper-clouds are open source's friends\n\nOpinion No, really.
