The following report represents a subset of the main Levels.fyi\ncompensation dataset. Using these data points we are able to determine\ndiscrepancies in compensation by gender.\n\n17,116\n\nTotal Gendered Data Points\n\n1 in 6\n\nSubmitted by Women\n\nWhile approximately 16% of the data points from the US in our dataset were\nsubmitted by women, the representation of women in STEM fields in the US\nstands notably higher at 24%, according to a report by MIT. This reveals a\nslight deviation between our reported data and the representation within the\nactual population. Understanding this breakdown helps us identify any large\noutlier differences or reporting biases. For example, women may be less\ninclined to submit data points for fear of identification on a team where they\nare a minority. Below, you can see the percentages of women and men in tech\nroles at large companies globally giving us some more concrete stats on gender\ndiversity within the industry.\n\nCompany| % Women in Tech Roles| % Men in Tech Roles  \n---|---|---  \nBlock| 30.6| 68.7  \nLinkedin| 29.3| 69.4  \nDropbox| 28| 72  \nMicrosoft| 26.6| 73.4  \nGoogle| 26.5| 73.5  \nApple| 24.9| 75.1  \nSplunk| 21.9| 78.1  \nDatadog| 21| 79  \nCloudera| 19.5| 80.5  \nUber| 15.7| 84.3  \n  \n### Pay Gap By Level\n\nThe Levels.fyi Standard is a leveling hierarchy we've abstracted from company-\nspecific names to make aggregation easier. Using this approximation for\nleveling, we model out the percentiles of total compensation by gender for\nsoftware engineering across the US overall, San Francisco Bay Area, Greater\nSeattle Area, and New York City. For a deeper look, you can filter individual\ndata points by gender on our compensation page.\n\nThe boxplots above highlight the differences in pay distributions by gender\nacross different normalized career levels. Interestingly at the lower levels,\nin some cases women even out-earn men. But generally male engineers earn\nhigher median salaries compared to female engineers. This gap gets more\npronounced at higher levels in the US, which reflects similar observations we\nmade in our 2020 report. The pattern of an expanding wage gap at later career\nstages is not new, but for Seattle and New York the highest disparity occurs\nat the second level right after the entry level. And while there is still a\ndisparity later on, it\u2019s less extreme than what\u2019s present at the second level.\nHowever for San Francisco, there is an initial disparity evident right from\nthe entry level position, which evens out at the second level, but is then\namplified in the final two career levels.\n\nOne explanation for these gaps can be in the ability and desire to negotiate.\nThis can also play a much larger role in subsequent promotions and career\nlevels which can highlight why larger disparities appear as you advance.\n\n### Trends over time\n\nThe graph below give us a peek into how the gender pay gap plays out at FAANG+\nand other top-paying companies between 2020 and 2023.\n\nAt first glance, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a significant pay gap between the\ngenders. This could be a result of the highly standardized nature of\ncompensation pay practices at larger tech companies. In previous years at the\nsenior level, the gap seems to have closed. However, there are still some\nnoticeable trends as you climb the ladder, where it becomes noticeable that\nwomen tend to fall behind, in particular, more recently as of last year.\n\nAdditionally, according to our data, the gender breakdown of submissions\nvaries across different levels. At the entry level, men represent 78% of\nsubmissions, while women represent 22%. This discrepancy persists as employees\nprogress through their careers, with men comprising 82% of submissions at the\nsecond level and 87% at the senior level.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that these differences can come from several\ndifferent overlapping forces. For example, societal practices might make men\nand women act differently when it comes to taking risks. Generally men are\noften get praised more for taking larger risks. It\u2019s also key to note that the\nlower population of women at higher levels can have self-perpetuating effects.\nThe fewer women there are, the fewer women may desire to be in those positions\nas well.\n\nOur website as well as our negotiation service aim to help level this playing\nfield so everyone is equipped with the data and leverage to negotiate the best\noutcome.\n\n### How can I contribute?\n\nWe're only as good as the data we collect.
