On Wednesday, the\nPentagon revealed the latest casualty.\n\nA new ground-launched version of an air-to-ground weapon developed for Ukraine\non a rapid timeline failed to hit targets in part because of Russian electro-\nmagnetic warfare, Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon's acquisition chief, said at an\nevent held by think tank CSIS.\n\nLaPlante suggested that Ukraine may no longer be interested in the weapon.\n\u201cWhen you send something to people in the fight of their lives that just\ndoesn\u2019t work, they\u2019ll try it three times and they\u2019ll just throw it aside,\u201d\nsaid LaPlante.\n\nThe weapon LaPlante is referring to is very likely the Ground-Launched Small\nDiameter Bomb (GLSDB) based on his description, according to Bryan Clark, a\nsenior fellow at the Hudson Institute.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson did not confirm that LaPlante was referring to GLSDB,\nbut said the company is \u201cworking closely with the [Defense Department] on\nspiral capability improvements to the ground-launch SDB system.\u201d Spiral\ncapability improvements refers to an iterative software development process.\n\nThe GLDSB boasts a range of 90 miles\u2014double the range of the Guided Multiple\nLaunch Rocket System (GMRLS) missiles Ukraine previously used to wreak havoc\non Russia\u2019s logistic centers. Funding for the weapon was approved in February\n2023, and Ukraine was reportedly using the weapon by February 2024.\n\nThe weapon relies on GPS to navigate to its targets. It also has an inertial\nnavigation system, which navigates to a target by estimating its position\nthrough the use of accelerometers and other devices.\n\nBut it is not the first GPS-guided weapon to fall afoul of Russian electronic\nwarfare.\n\nIn congressional testimony in March, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow Daniel\nPatt said the targeting system for the GPS-guided Excalibur round \u201cdropped\nfrom 70 percent effectiveness to 6 percent effectiveness over a matter of a\nfew months as new EW mechanisms came out\u201d in Ukraine. Patt cited the work of\nJack Watling, an expert at think-tank RUSI who has traveled to Ukraine\nmultiple times to interview Ukrainian commanders.\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\nRussian electronic warfare attacks have also directed GMLRS missiles off\ncourse, CNN reported last spring. The missiles are similarly guided by a GPS.\nRussia has also successfully used electronic warfare against GPS-guided Joint\nDirect Attack Munitions (JDAMs), which are retrofitted aerial bombs.\n\nRussian electronic warfare on the U.S.\u2019s \u201cmore precise capabilities is a\nchallenge,\u201d the commander of the chief U.S. aid coordinating group told an\naudience in December.\n\nClark, citing a presentation by Ukrainian soldiers, said the Russians use GPS\nspoofers to throw off the munitions.\n\nGPS spoofers work by sending false location data to GPS navigation devices.\nBecause GPS signals are weak, a stronger, false signal can be sent to override\nthe correct inputs. Russia has used GPS spoofing in Ukraine since at least\n2018. But advancements in technology mean spoofers can be created cheaply with\njust a software-defined radio and open-source software.\n\nThe weapons the spoofers are working against, meanwhile, are anything but\ncheap. A GMLRS missile costs around $160,000, while an Excalibur round can\ncost as much as $100,000. The GLDSB costs around $40,000.\n\nHowever, the weapons were largely designed for a period before spoofers were\nso easy to set up, Clark said. \u201cYou didn't really see the advent of\nminiaturized, capable GPS spoofers until the last ten years or so, because you\nneeded the micro-electronics to be able to do it,\u201d Clark said.\n\nRussia has saturated the front with electronic warfare, Clark said. Truck-\nmounted electronic warfare systems primarily focused on jamming drones are\nlocated every six to nine miles on Ukraine\u2019s frontline, he said.\n\nBut Ukraine could use other U.S. munitions that are not susceptible to GPS\nspoofing, Clark added, citing the Harpoon missile.\n\nThe U.S. could also provide more sophisticated munitions, like the JASSM\n(Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile), but Clark discounted that possibility\nbecause of its range. The Biden. administration has sought to limit Ukraine\u2019s\nuse of longer-range weapons that could target Russia directly.\n\nAnother solution might be to launch weapons from F-16s. Ukrainian pilots\ncurrently launch JDAMS from Soviet planes that can\u2019t pass navigational data to\nthe JDAMS, whereas F-16s can, Clark said. Ukrainian pilots are training on\nF-16s and will be ready to fly them by the end of this year.\n\nUkraine can also work to jam Russia\u2019s systems, Clark added. Russia has mostly\nbeen using an analog of the JDAM, the KAB, which can also be misdirected by\nspoofing its guidance system.\n\nAnd Ukraine is \u201cfielding some systems now\u201d for electronic warfare targeting of\nsatellite navigation, Clark said. Still, since Russia is targeting civilian\npopulations, \u201cthey may not care that much if they get spoofed.\u201d\n\nShare This:\n\nNEXT STORY: The D Brief: Houthis renew ship attacks; More ATACMS to Ukraine;\nGaza pier update; Changes at SOF school; And a bit more.\n\nThe goal of 100K artillery shells per month is back in sight, Army says\n\nEurope is already planning for what happens if Ukraine loses.
