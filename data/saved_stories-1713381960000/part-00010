The\nregulation should also not apply to \u201cconfidential information\u201d such as\nprofessional secrets (Article 1 (2b)). The EU governments reject the idea that\nthe new EU Child Protection Centre should support them in the prevention of\nchild sexual abuse and develop best practices for prevention initiatives\n(Article 43(8)).\n\n\u201cThe fact that the EU interior ministers want to exempt police officers,\nsoldiers, intelligence officers and even themselves from chat control scanning\nproves that they know exactly just how unreliable and dangerous the snooping\nalgorithms are that they want to unleash on us citizens,\u201d commented Pirate\nParty MEP Patrick Breyer. \u201cThey seem to fear that even military secrets\nwithout any link to child sexual abuse could end up in the US at any time. The\nconfidentiality of government communications is certainly important, but the\nsame must apply to the protection of business and of course citizens\ncommunications, including the spaces that victims of abuse themselves need for\nsecure exchanges and therapy. We know that most of the chats leaked by today\u2019s\nvoluntary snooping algorithms are of no relevance to the police, for example\nfamily photos or consensual sexting. It is outrageous that the EU interior\nministers themselves do not want to suffer the consequences of the destruction\nof digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption that they are\nimposing on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe promise that professional secrets should not be affected by chat control\nis a lie cast in paragraphs. No provider and no algorithm can know or\ndetermine whether a chat is being conducted with doctors, therapists, lawyers,\ndefence lawyers, etc. so as to exempt it from chat control. Chat control\ninevitably threatens to leak intimate photos sent for medical purposes and\ntrial documents sent for defending abuse victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes a mockery of the official goal of child protection that the EU\ninterior ministers reject the development of best practices for preventing\nchild sexual abuse. It couldn\u2019t be clearer that the aim of this bill is China-\nstyle mass surveillance and not better protecting our children. Real child\nprotection would require a systematic scientific evaluation and implementation\nof multidisciplinary prevention programmes, as well as Europe-wide standards\nand guidelines for criminal investigations into child abuse, including the\nidentification of victims and the necessary technical means. None of this is\nplanned by the EU interior ministers.\u201d\n\nThe EU governments want to adopt the chat control bill by the beginning of\nJune.\n\nTagsChatcontrol\n\n### 0 comments on \u201c#ChatControl: EU ministers want to exempt themselves\u201d\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n## Topics\n\nAI Act Andrej Babi\u0161 Anja Hirschel Anti-corruption Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence Act Belarus Biometric Mass Surveillance Cannabis\nChatcontrol Content Moderation Crypto Cryptocurrencies Dalai Lama Digital\nCovid Certificate Digital Markets Act Digital Services Act DMA DSA e-ID ECJ\neID European Commission European Health Data Space European Parliament\nEuropean Pirates Delegation European politics Fit for 55 Internet freedom\nInteroperability Julian Assange Marcel Kolaja Mark\u00e9ta Gregorov\u00e1 Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Peksa\nOpen Letter Pandora Papers Patrick Breyer Political Ads PPEU Qatar Right to\nrepair Russia Taiwan Transparency Ukraine\n\n# More Informations\n\n## Navigation\n\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2024 European Pirate Party\n  * Powered by WordPress\n  * Theme: Pirate Rogue by xwolf\n\n## Follow us:\n\n  * Facebook page\n  * Twitter page\n  * YouTube\n\nTo change your privacy setting, e.g. granting or withdrawing consent, click\nhere: Settings\n\n", "frontpage": true}
