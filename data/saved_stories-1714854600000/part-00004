A modern\ndevice boasting fully replaceable components? Intriguing beyond belief. Well,\nI knew I was going to need a laptop for my Certificate in Design, and the\nFramework seemed like a no brainer, so I got it. I ordered my Framework on the\n27th of November 2022, and received it a mere four days later, on December\n1st. Today is a year to the day from its arrival, so I saw it fit to give a\nbit of a review.\n\nI bought the DIY edition, along with the SSD and RAM, directly from Framework.\nThe specs of my specific configuration are as follows:\n\n  * CPU: 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1240P (16) @ 4.40 GHz\n  * GPU: Intel Iris Xe Graphics\n  * Memory: 2x 8GB DDR4-3200 RAM\n  * Storage: 1TB WD BLACK SN770 NVMe SSD\n\n## Assembly and Setup\n\nMy laptop came very well packed, and upon unboxing, I got straight to building\nit. As I opted for the DIY edition, I had to remove the input cover, place in\nthe SSD and RAM, and then reassemble the device. Then all I needed to do was\nslide in my expansion cards, and I was good to go. This was a very simple\nprocess, and the guide regarding it was comprehensive. The newer models are\neven easier, as the input cover comes detached.\n\nFollowing up on the hardware setup was the software setup. Installing Arch, my\nLinux distro of choice, proved nearly as seamless as ever. I did have to\nimplement a small fix to get the brightness keys to function, but it was\nstraightforward to implement and well documented. This was particularly\nfantabulous, as Arch isn't among their officially supported Linux distros. In\nfact, it's refreshing to see a list of officially supported distros at all.\n\n## Cost & Value\n\nThe cost associated with the Framework is undeniably high. There is no way\naround that. In comparison to other laptops with similar specifications, it is\nmarginally more expensive. However, the initial cost shouldn't be the only\nconsideration. Purchasing the Framework Laptop means investing in\nrepairability. While it might seem more expensive upfront, the long-term value\nlies in the ability to replace components over time. This aspect ultimately\njustifies the initial expense, making it a more cost effective choice in the\nlong run. It's also worth noting that you're supporting a smaller company\nthat, in my opinion, seems dedicated to doing the right thing.\n\nWith that said, you can save some money when buying your laptop by acquiring\nyour RAM and SDD from alternative sources. Prices are inflated when purchasing\ndirectly from Framework, and better prices can be found when purchasing\nonline. You can quite easily shave $100 AUD off the price by purchasing the\ncomponents online.\n\n## Build Quality\n\nThe build quality of the Framework is alright. While it doesn't exude the\nsturdiness of some other laptops I've encountered, it's far from flimsy. There\nis minor flex in the chassis if picking the laptop up from a corner, but it is\nso minimal that it's hardly of relevance. Of more notable concern are the\nscreen and hinge.\n\nThe screen itself is excellent. It's 3:2 aspect ratio is ideal for tasks such\nas coding and document processing but affects the structural design, leading\nto flex, which causes screen wobbling at the slightest nudge. This makes\ntyping on a lap or in a car rather challenging. The hinge is also a hindrance,\nas it struggles to hold the screen at more aggressive angles. They have\nreleased newer, stronger hinges as an optional addition to combat this.\n\n## Modularity & Customisation\n\nThe reason that just about anyone would buy a Framework is for its user\naccessible servicing and customisation options. While I haven't yet broken my\nlaptop, it's quite the comfort to know that at any point I can simply replace\na broken part with nothing but the included screwdriver.\n\nSpeaking of the included screwdriver, it's much better than it has any right\nto be. Its magnetically attached tip can be removed to allow choice between\nboth Torx and Phillips heads, and the reverse side has a handy pry tool. It's\nbody has a great build and flat edges to prevent it rolling away. I frequently\nfind myself applying its utility beyond laptop matters.\n\nReturning to the laptop, the flexibility to swap out components whenever I\nchoose or opt for an upgrade adds a layer of convenience. The prospect of\nseamlessly installing new parts as they release is a significant advantage, as\nis choosing exactly the ports and components I want.\n\n## Battery Life\n\nThere is a negative sentiment online regarding the battery on the Framework.\nI've seen countless people claim that they only yield 5 hours of battery life\nfrom a charge. While that may have been true at a point, things have since\nimproved. There was an issue with select expansion cards that caused increased\npower use, but, fortunately, Framework fixed it in subsequent productions and\nreleased a fix for those capable of performing it. Yes, these are issues, but\nFramework has gone above and beyond in not only addressing, but also actively\nrectifying them to the best of their ability.\n\nThey've released a new 61Wh battery and battery optimisation improvements in\ntheir newer generations, especially in the AMD chipsets. Even without these\nimprovements, I've been able to surpass over 10 hours out of the 55Wh battery\nin my laptop with some battery optimisations.\n\n## Support\n\nSpeaking of their commitment to addressing issues, their user support is\nexcellent. In the few instances where I've contacted support, I've generally\ngotten very helpful and timely responses. Admirably, they seem to prioritise\nthe mental health of their support employees. Their stance against abuse and\naversion to seasonal hiring demonstrates a conscientious approach I really\ncan't say I've seen elsewhere.\n\nAs for their software support, that can be a bit more hit and miss. My 12th\nGen Framework has been waiting on a BIOS update with numerous improvements,\nsuch as compatibility with the new 61Wh battery. There has been work done, but\nit's been in beta for several months and sets a bad precedent.\n\n## Community\n\nIt isn't just Framework themselves that support their products, but also the\nsurrounding community. The community cultivated around the Framework Laptop is\ntruly exceptional, the likes I haven't seen with any other product. The\ncompany hosts an open and highly constructive forum where users share all\nsorts of things. Every second day someone shares some crazy thing like spring\nloaded expansion cards or a crazy new form factor. It's excellent to see. I've\nfound that any issue I've encountered, no matter how obscure (and trust me, I\nstumble upon some pretty obscure ones), has had some solution or ongoing\ndiscussion within the forums.\n\n## Overall Evaluation\n\nI think the Framework Laptop is excellent for just about anyone needing a\ncomputer, but especially the technologically inclined. This machine is\nexcellent, especially as a tech enthusiast. The modularity and adaptability\nmakes tinkering an absolute joy. Especially when backed by an exceptional\ncommunity that's always ready to dive into the depths of innovation.\n\nIf you need any further evidence as to how highly I regard the Framework\nLaptop 13, then the fact that I convinced my brother to select one as a\nreplacement for his ageing Surface Go should tell you all you need to know. As\nhe got it more recently, he had the option of the new AMD model, which meant\nwaiting a while due to the batch system, but it only took just over a week to\narrive once it shipped. He's been very happy with it, and it's worked\nexcellently thus far.\n\n## February 2023 Update\n\nI'm still loving my Framework, but a bit has changed since I wrote this\narticle. Firstly, Framework has finally taken action in regards to the BIOS\nand has released a new beta. This is great to see, as I was beginning to\nworry. People have also started receiving the new Framework Laptop 16, which\nis very exciting.\n\nIn terms of my specific computer, I've made some changes. At the end of 2023,\nI moved from Arch Linux to NixOS. It's got an awesome declarative\nconfiguration model that allows the entire OS to be regenerated whenever\nneeded. I truly do love it. I also chose to leverage the modularity of my\nFramework by switching out my keyboard. As I use Colemak DH, there wasn't much\npoint in having a QWERTY keyboard, so I moved to a blank keyboard. The process\nwasn't too hard, and was well documented, but took quite a bit of time. There\nwere so many screws. I'm happy with the result though, and really love the\nsleek, minimalist style it provides.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review. If you've got any questions about the laptop or\nthink there is something I could add, then let me know in the comments below.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
