But if you buy online, the \u00a350 budget has to include delivery.\n\n  * It has to be bought from a commercial source, not cadged off another friend / found in a skip etc.\n\n\u201cBest\u201d was a subjective criterion and, after all, it was supposed to be a bit\nof fun.\n\n# My plan\n\nMy immediate thought was a Surface Go, but I ruled that out because (a)\nthere\u2019s no fun in that for me (because I\u2019ve bought and sorted cheap Surface Go\nmachines before), and (b) I\u2019ve paid close to \u00a350 for them in the past, but not\nactually \u00a350.\n\nI also considered some kind of Chromebook. There are plenty of these for under\n\u00a350, and I\u2019ve not played with a Chromebook, but for \u00a350 I\u2019m probably only\ngetting 2GB RAM, 4GB tops, and it has to run a current/supported OS. So I\nruled that out, but I reckon it would be fun to explore that in the future.\n\nA tablet with a keyboard might just have complied with the rules, but even if\nit did, and even if I could find one, with a keyboard, for \u00a350, finding one\nwith an OS - either factory-supplied, or which I could install - which would\nstill get software updates and security patches seemed like a stretch.\nPossibly something onto which I could flash postmarketOS.\n\nSo I thought I\u2019d see how cheaply I could buy a ThinkPad...\n\n# I bought a ThinkPad\n\n... and the answer is \u201cvery cheaply\u201d.\n\nFor the princely sum of \u00a330 (plus \u00a38 delivery), I bought a ThinkPad L380.\n\nIn fact, the price seemed so good to me, that I wondered if it was actually\ngoing to arrive. Remember the P-P-P-Powerbook saga from 20ish years ago?!\n\n# ... and it worked!\n\nIt is not a luxury / high end machine, for sure, but still it has an i5-8250U\nprocessor, 8GB RAM, and 256GB NVMe storage, as well as two USB-C ports and an\non-board HDMI port.\n\nAnd it worked! No BIOS password, no odd beeping, nothing.\n\nThat\u2019s a heck of a lot of computer for the money, in my opinion.\n\nNo Ethernet port, sadly, but I knew that when I bought it.\n\nPhysically, it was in a pretty good shape other than a ding to one of the\ncorners (of which more below).\n\nIt needed a wipe down - I just used a screen wipe - and it looked pretty good\nafter that.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have any of the marks on the screen which are visible on some\nsecondhand ThinkPads. I\u2019ve got a few on the machine I use day to day and it\ndoesn\u2019t bother me, but on this \u00a330 machine, there aren\u2019t any anyway!\n\n# It did not come with a charger\n\nIt did not come with a USB-C charger.\n\nSince I have one, I didn\u2019t worry about it, but obviously if I was buying this\nas my only computer, I couldn\u2019t guarantee that I\u2019d have one.\n\nLooking on eBay, I spotted a couple at around the \u00a312 mark, so I reckon it is\njust about do-able, even if I didn\u2019t actually do it.\n\n# Fixing the cracked corner\n\nI invested \u00a35 in a tube of black epoxy Milliput, for which I needed just the\ntiniest amount.\n\nThis was purely aesthetic; the machine runs just fine with the cracked corner\nthere, so I needn\u2019t have spent this \u00a35.\n\nAfter the fix, it is not perfect, but it looks pretty darned good.\n\n# It didn\u2019t come with Windows\n\nThere was no OS on the machine when it arrived - nor was I expecting one, as\nit said that it didn\u2019t have one.\n\nThat, for me, was no problem at all, as I was going to install Debian anyway.\n\nAnd, Debian installed fine, as expected, with a firmware update available too.\nVery slick.\n\nSo I guess that one might say I should have factored in money for an 8GB USB\nstick, to use for the OS installation?\n\n# Battery life?\n\nCurrently, from a full charge, GNOME projects a battery life of about 9 hours.\n\nHow optimistic that is, I don\u2019t know, and obviously it would depend on usage\nanyway.\n\nBut there\u2019s certainly enough life left in the battery to use it off the mains\nfor a reasonable period of time.\n\n# Spending the \u201cspare\u201d \u00a312\n\nSince I had paid only \u00a338 for it, from a budget of \u00a350, I could have bought\nanother 8GB of RAM for it - eBay, secondhand - and increased it to 16GB RAM,\nas it has a spare RAM slot. I didn\u2019t, as I have no need for it.\n\nBut if someone already had a USB-C charger, and wasn\u2019t fussed about the\ncracked corner, that\u2019s probably the best upgrade available for the money.\n\n# Was it \u201cthe best\u201d?\n\nThis was obviously subjective and, as it turned out, life got in the way of my\nfriend taking part anyway. Oh well.\n\nI\u2019m pleased with it, and frankly astonished that I could get such a good\nmachine for \u00a330 + postage.\n\nObviously, this was a bit of fun. I can afford to take a gamble on it not\nworking. And I was only ever going to install Linux on it, and knew what I was\ndoing, and so on. But, all the same, wow that\u2019s a lot of computer for the\nmoney.\n\n# You may also like:\n\n  * Comparing Lenovo's Active Pen and Active Pen 2 for writing on a ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 2 using Debian Linux\n  * Getting the Sierra Wireless EM7455 LTE modem working in a ThinkPad with Debian 12 Linux (with GPS)\n  * Making my ThinkPad LED flash 'decoded.legal' in morse code\n  * The wireless ambidextrous Penguin Posturite mouse and Linux\n  * Changing the default resize value in nautilus-image-converter\n  * Scanning to Debian 12 with a Fujitsi ix500\n  * Creating a partition larger than 2TB on an SSD on Linux\n  * Multiplayer Quake III Arena on Linux (client and server)\n  * A working wireless plug-and-play display solution for Linux laptops (and others OSs)\n  * Improving my laptop's battery with TLP\n  * Stopping music in my office automatically when I get a phone call or join an audio/video call\n  * Adding an Internet radio stream (such as RadioFreeFedi) to mpd\n  * Fixing dropbear-initramfs '/scripts/init-premount/dropbear: cat: not found' error\n  * Keeping bash history in sync using atuin and a self-hosted sync server\n  * Keyboard shortcut for adding random albums to the playlist in ncmpcpp\n\nAll posts CC BY-SA-NC 4.0 or any later version, unless otherwise stated.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
