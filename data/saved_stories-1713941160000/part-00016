It brings individuals together,\nincreases happiness and releases stress. Some even consider entertainment a\nbasic human need.\n\nPrint media\u2014newspapers, magazine news, or books, to name a few\u2014is the oldest\nform of mass communication. It started around 1440, and Johannes Gutenberg is\noften cited as the inventor of the printing press, the device that made it\npossible to print letters on printing mediums with ink.\n\nLater, radios debuted in the early 20th century and influenced mass media\ncommunication. Thereupon came the era of animated visual imagery\u2014television.\nThe first broadcast was in 1928, and from there on, everything else followed,\nfrom VCR to DVDs along with extensions that can be connected to televisions,\nsuch as game consoles.\n\n> Radio outperformed newspaper because of voice, TV outperformed radio because\n> of motion, and the internet is outperforming television because of\n> interactivity.\n\nToday, the combination and culmination of print media, radio, and television\ngrew to become the media and entrainment industry (M&E). The USA is the\nlargest player globally, with an industry valued at $720 Billion.\n\nMovies, video games, videos, and music are all substrates of the M&E industry.\nThe trillion-dollar industry has been growing at a pace of 5% year over year,\nrepresenting roughly 800 billion over the last decade.\n\nThe industry has nearly doubled in market value from 1,39 trillion in 2011 to\n2,3 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach 2,6 by 2025.\n\nWhat led to these astronomical numbers has a lot to do with our desire for\nexperiences beyond reality.\n\nLet's explore the relationship between the M&E industry, innovation, and\nattention.\n\n### How do virtual experiences fuel innovation and the economy?\n\nLike psychedelics, virtual experiences that help us escape reality release\nfeel-good chemicals such as dopamine and endorphins. For example, experiences\nsuch as watching a movie*, listening to music or playing video games create a\nfeeling of relaxation and pleasure associated with the release of these\nchemicals.\n\nResearch conducted by Patrick Barwise and his colleagues reveals that watching\nTV and videos generated brainwaves associated with pleasant, wakeful\nrelaxation and absorbed cognitive capacity, taking viewers' minds off other\nthings.\n\nThe ability of these experiences to take us away from the present in a\npleasant manner is the value they provide us with. It, therefore, comes as no\nsurprise that the most-watched movie categories are primarily those with a lot\nof visual tricks and illusions.\n\nThe consumer and enterprise virtual reality (VR) market revenue worldwide has\nbeen on an upward trend since 2019 and is forecasted to reach $12,19 billion\nby 2024.\n\nIt is fair to say that our desire for virtual experiences has not been slowing\ndown either. We crave more of these sorts of virtual adventures.\n\nWhen we watch an episode of a series, we suddenly feel the need to watch the\nnext one and the one after (simply put, binge-watching) and this phenomenon is\nassociated with several positive effects. The same applies to video games.\n\nThey allow us to be in places we would not otherwise be; we essentially escape\nreality.\n\nThe problem, however, is that with time, we get bored, as they become\nredundant and no longer entertaining. If they no longer provide us with the\nfeeling of relaxation and fun they are intended to deliver, we crave novelty.\n\nTherefore, to keep us hooked and gain our attention, it is essential to have\nnew and fresh experiences. To say the least, creating these new virtual\nexperiences will require creative ideas fused with modern technology to allow\ntheir quick realisation, of high quality and at scale.\n\nUltimately this has led to an increased output of contents (for the better and\nthe worse), so much so that we cannot possibly consume all that there is to\nconsume, let alone extract value from them.\n\nYou have probably heard of the so-called attention economy. But before diving\ninto the attention economy, let's have a look at the concept of attention.\n\n### Attention And The Economy\n\nAttention is defined as the ability to focus selectively on some information\nwhile ignoring others.\n\nIn other words, when we give attention to something, we choose to value that\nthing more than the available alternatives.\n\nThis suggests that attention implies consideration, importance, or value or\nall of them and that value or importance drives the so-called attention\neconomy.\n\nHerbert Simon, the 1970s Nobel Prize-winning economist, coined the term\n\"Attention Economy\", saying: \"What information consumes is the attention of\nits recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention\".\n\nThe idea behind this is that our attention is very limited, and external\nstimuli far outweigh our focus breadth.\n\nThere is a supply and demand imbalance, where we have more information on the\nsupply side and a short focus span on the demand side, which could represent\nan opportunity for economic gains.\n\nStudies show that our attention span has been on the decline over the past\ndecade and is now less than 9 seconds.\n\nBecause of this scarcity, especially in today's technology-driven economy, the\nwinners in the quest for attention will need to create value before they can\ncapture it.\n\nWhoever can capture our attention can then leverage it for financial gains (or\nperhaps something else).\n\n### The Emergence of Attention-based Marketing(ABM)\n\nWe constantly interact with the virtual world, which requires us to pay\nattention.\n\nThe amount of information available makes it difficult to focus on one single\nthing for an extended period of time; in other words, we all suffer from\ndigital ADHD.\n\nThe way content is consumed has reshaped how it is produced and distributed\nacross various platforms. It is often done in short formats (think of TikTok\nor Youtube shorts) to not bore consumers and lose them.\n\nAnd modern marketers are leveraging new ways to extract value from attention\nthrough attention-based marketing.\n\nAttention-based marketing(ABM) optimises marketing efforts by understanding\nwhat catches customers' attention. ABM combines many fields such as consumer\nbehaviour, vision research, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience to support\nmarketing goals.\n\nThis, in turn, allows companies to increase brand awareness. The attention\neconomy does not only revolve around increasing brand awareness but also in\nshaping consumer behaviour.\n\nMarketers use their customers' psychological, emotional, and aspirational\nappeal to promote products and services.\n\nABM has been accelerated by the evolution of technological measures for eye\ntracking, which makes it easier for firms to leverage data through the\ndifferent mediums users use to engage with their content.\n\nUltimately, the goal of using such technologies and processes is to improve\nthe consumer's overall experience by providing them with what they are looking\nfor, at the right place and at the right time.\n\n### How Does Innovation Fuel The Quest for Attention?\n\nIn today's ever-changing Information and Innovations Age, we are constantly\ndeveloping new technologies\u2014each one promising to be the new best thing.\n\nThese technologies enable us to create and be part of virtual simulations that\nmirror reality and often disconnect us from it, blurring the lines between the\nreal and virtual world. The driving force that makes it all possible is not\nour desire for these experiences alone.\n\nAt the core, what supports the creation of such experiences and fuels the\ngrowth of the M&E industry(among many others) at large, are these tiny, often\nunnoticed devices that run under the hood\u2014microchips.\n\n### The Role of Microchips\n\nEver since the dawn of chip-sized components, microchips have vastly increased\nthe capabilities of nearly every device available.\n\nFrom built-in GPS in cars to memory chips found in portable phones, we are\nable to explore more opportunities within what seems to be a limitless virtual\nworld. They allow us to create unprecedented digital simulations.\n\nThey make it simple to store, process, and transmit information. They provide\nthe tools that are needed to make the virtual feel real. Many of our daily\ntools such as phones, computers, television, or credit card are all real-life\nuse cases of microchips that rely on semiconductors to function correctly.\n\nHere is a visual of the global semiconductor market share with the networking\nand communication application segment dominating the market, which comes as no\nsurprise given that most information exchanges go through a complex network of\nmachines.\n\nHere is how it affects creators at the individual level.\n\nImagine the creative artist that takes hours or often days to render his work;\nnow, with a new and improved chip, technology can produce the same creative\nwork in under 30 minutes, all the while making the experience more fun because\nthey have access to a new chip that allow them to produce better, faster and\nwith more special effects.\n\nThis, in turn, allows them to produce more. The more they produce, the easier\nit is to access larger audiences (partly due to platform algorithms) which\nincreases the demand for such creative work, provided it is of quality. And\nthe cycle goes on.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nIt's all connected\u2014Innovation, Entertainment and Attention. Attention is\nvaluable, and M&E players are fighting to get as much of it as possible. It is\na game of both providing and capturing value, on the one hand by fulfilling\nour desire and on the other by monetising our attention.\n\nIn the end, the winners of the attention economy will need to create more\nvalue before they can capture it because our attention span is short (and\nprobably decreasing). As our needs(fictional and real) increase, the pressure\non the M&E players grows, which will trigger a massive demand in the\nsemiconductor industry.\n\nMoreover, the relentless quest for virtual experiences will only continue to\ngrow, particularly in countries where most of the population has access to the\ninternet.\n\nObviously, many other factors, such as consumerism, digital identity, climate,\ndata processing, etc., need to be considered because the system is\ninterconnected and complex. But to give credit where it's due, the M&E\nindustry and its supporting industries are not only important but\nindispensable.\n\n#### References\n\nGerben Bakker, 2011.\"Leisure Time, Cinema and the Structure of Household\nEntertainment Expenditure, 1890\u20131940,\" Chapters, in Samuel Cameron (ed.),\nHandbook on the Economics of Leisure, chapter 16,Edward Elgar\nPublishing.https://ideas.repec.org/h/elg/eechap/13469_16.html>\n\nAll\u00c3 \u0308gre L Hadida & Joseph Lampel & Amit Joshi & W.
