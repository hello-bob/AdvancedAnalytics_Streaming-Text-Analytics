This marks the first\ntime that cosmetic procedures have been associated with an HIV outbreak,\naccording to a detailed report of the outbreak investigation published today.\n\n### Further Reading\n\n\u201cVampire facials\u201d promoted by celebs are linked to new HIV cases\n\nArs reported on the cluster last year when state health officials announced\nthey were still identifying cases linked to the spa despite it being shut down\nin September 2018. But today's investigation report offers more insight into\nthe unprecedented outbreak, which linked five people with HIV infections to\nthe spa and spurred investigators to contact and test nearly 200 other spa\nclients. The report appears in the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nThe investigation began when a woman between the ages of 40 and 50 turned up\npositive on a rapid HIV test taken while she was traveling abroad in the\nsummer of 2018. She had a stage 1 acute infection. It was a result that was as\ndumbfounding as it was likely distressing. The woman had no clear risk factors\nfor acquiring the infection: no injection drug use, no blood transfusions, and\nher current and only recent sexual partner tested negative. But, she did\nreport getting a vampire facial in the spring of 2018 at a spa in Albuquerque\ncalled VIP Spa.\n\n\"Vampire facial\" is the common name for a platelet-rich plasma microneedling\nprocedure. In this treatment, a patient's blood is drawn, spun down to\nseparate out plasma from blood cells, and the platelet-rich plasma is then\ninjected into the face with microneedles. It's claimed\u2014with little\nevidence\u2014that it can rejuvenate and improve the look of skin, and got notable\npromotions from celebrities, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe woman's case led investigators to VIP Spa, which was unlicensed, had no\nappointment scheduling system, and did not store client contact information.\nIn an inspection in the fall of 2018, health investigators found shocking\nconditions: unwrapped syringes in drawers and counters, unlabeled tubes of\nblood sitting out on a kitchen counter, more unlabeled blood and medical\ninjectables alongside food in a kitchen fridge, and disposable\nequipment\u2014electric desiccator tips\u2014that were reused. The facility also did not\nhave an autoclave\u2014a pressurized oven\u2014for sterilizing equipment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## A novel and challenging investigation\n\nThe spa was quickly shut down, and the owner Maria de Lourdes Ramos De Ruiz,\n62, was charged with practicing medicine without a license. In 2022, she\npleaded guilty to five counts and is serving a three-and-a-half-year prison\nsentence.\n\nA second spa client, another woman between the ages of 40 and 50, tested\npositive for HIV in a screen in the fall of 2018 and received a diagnosis in\nearly 2019. She has received a vampire facial in the summer of 2018. Her HIV\ninfection was also at stage 1. Investigators scrambled to track down dozens of\nother clients, who mostly spoke Spanish as their first language. The next two\nidentified cases weren't diagnosed until the fall of 2021.\n\nThe two cases diagnosed in 2021 were sexual partners: a woman who received\nthree vampire facials in the spring and summer of 2018 from the spa and her\nmale partner. Both had a stage 3 HIV infection, which is when the infection\nhas developed into Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The severity of\nthe infections suggested the two had been infected prior to the woman's 2018\nspa treatments. Health officials uncovered that the woman had tested positive\nin an HIV screen in 2016, though she did not report being notified of the\nresult.\n\nThe health officials reopened their outbreak investigation in 2023 and found a\nfifth case that was diagnosed in the spring of 2023, which was also in a woman\naged 40 to 50 who had received a vampire facial in the summer of 2018. She had\na stage 3 infection and was hospitalized with an AIDS-defining illness.\n\nViral genetic sequencing from the five cases shows that the infections are all\nclosely related. But, given the extent of the unsanitary and contaminated\nconditions at the facility, investigators were unable to determine precisely\nhow the infections spread in the spa. In all, 198 spa clients were tested for\nHIV between 2018 and 2023, the investigators report.\n\n\"Incomplete spa client records posed a substantial challenge during this\ninvestigation, necessitating a large-scale outreach approach to identify\npotential cases,\" the authors acknowledge. However, the investigation's\nfinding \"underscores the importance of determining possible novel sources of\nHIV transmission among persons with no known HIV risk factors.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n98\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
