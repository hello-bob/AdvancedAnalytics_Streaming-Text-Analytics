The first is that search.chatgpt.com is\nshowing in the log files for some servers, and also, yesterday, there were\nmore business-oriented rumors of OpenAI launching a search engine on May 9th.\n\nAshutosh Shrivastava shared a screenshot that shows OpenAI's recent SSL\ncertificate logs revealed the domain search.chatgpt.com. He said that this\n\"may indicate that OpenAI is developing a search functionality.\" He shared\nthis with me on X and shared this screenshot of the log:\n\nThe logs came from Jimmy Apples, who posted this over here:\n\n> Thanks @apples_jimmy for logs.https://t.co/Ppmn3B9NRS\n>\n> \u2014 AshutoshShrivastava (@ai_for_success) April 28, 2024\n\nIt took me a few days to cover it because I went offline for Passover, but it\nlooks like Analutics India Magizine covered it and wrote, \"OpenAI is likely to\nannounce a new search engine soon, revealed Jimmy Apples, stating that the\ncompany is looking to host an event this month, tentatively on May 9, 2024, at\n10 a.m.\" That is a very specific date and time.\n\n\u201cThey were advertising for in house events staff and events marketing back in\nJanuary, they just hired an events manager last month\u201d said Jimmy Apples,\nhinting at a big deal event coming in the month of June, where OpenAI might\nrelease its next model \u2014 \u201cwhat ever sam decides to call it.\u201d\n\nI suspect whatever OpenAI launches, it won't be exactly like Google Search but\nwe will see. I do like that we are seeing more alternatives to Google Search,\nnot just from Bing but also Perplexity AI and others.\n\nForum discussion at X.\n\nCopied!\n\n## Popular Categories\n\n  * Google\n  * Bing\n  * Algorithm Updates\n  * Maps\n  * Ads\n\n## The Pulse of the search community\n\nFollow\n\nSubscribe Options\n\n## Search Video Recaps\n\nVideo Details More Videos Subscribe to Videos\n\n## Most Recent Articles\n\nGoogle Search Engine Optimization\n\n## May 2024 Google Webmaster Report\n\nMay 2, 2024 - 7:51 am\n\n0 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nGoogle Search Engine Optimization\n\n## Google: Helpful Content Update Recoveries May Take Much Longer Than Others\n\nMay 2, 2024 - 7:41 am\n\n24 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nOther Search Engines\n\n## Report: OpenAI To Launch Search Engine\n\nMay 2, 2024 - 7:31 am\n\n2 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nGoogle Ads\n\n## Google Ads To Automatically Pause Low-Activity Keywords Next Month\n\nMay 2, 2024 - 7:21 am\n\n0 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nGoogle Search Engine Optimization\n\n## Forbes Completely Removes (410 Server Status) Coupon Directory\n\nMay 2, 2024 - 7:11 am\n\n1 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nGoogle Ads\n\n## Google Ads To Disallow Services For Deepfake Sexual Content\n\nMay 2, 2024 - 7:05 am\n\n0 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nPrevious Story: Google Ads To Automatically Pause Low-Activity Keywords Next\nMonth\n\nNext Story: Google: Helpful Content Update Recoveries May Take Much Longer\nThan Others\n\n  * Submit a Thread\n  * Forum Search\n  * Awards\n  * About Us\n  * Comments Policy\n  * Advertise\n  * Contact\n\nThe content at the Search Engine Roundtable are the sole opinion of the\nauthors and in no way reflect views of RustyBrick \u00ae, Inc Copyright \u00a9 1994-2024\nRustyBrick \u00ae, Inc.
