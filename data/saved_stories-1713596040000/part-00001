But asymptomatic cows in North Carolina may require a reassessment.\n\nSo far, bird flu in cattle seems to affect only lactating cows, and only\ntemporarily. There have been no diagnoses in calves, pregnant heifers or beef\ncows, and no deaths.Credit...Jim Vondruska/Reuters\n\nBy Apoorva Mandavilli and Emily Anthes\n\nApril 19, 2024Updated 8:06 p.m. ET\n\nIn the month since federal authorities announced an outbreak of bird flu on\ndairy farms, they have repeatedly reassured the public that the spate of\ninfections does not impact the nation\u2019s food or milk supply, and poses little\nrisk to the public.\n\nYet the outbreak among cows may be more serious than originally believed. In\nan obscure online update this week, the Department of Agriculture said there\nis now evidence that the virus is spreading among cows, and from cows to\npoultry.\n\nOfficials in North Carolina have detected bird flu infections in a cattle herd\nwith no symptoms, The New York Times has learned \u2014 information the U.S.D.A.\nhas not shared publicly. The finding suggests that the infections may be more\nwidespread than thought.\n\nWhether there are asymptomatic animals elsewhere remains unclear, because the\nU.S.D.A. is not requiring farms to test cattle for infection. It has been\nreimbursing farmers for testing, but only for 20 cows per farm that were\nvisibly ill. This week, the department said it would begin reimbursing farms\nfor testing cows without symptoms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFederal officials have shared limited genetic information about the virus with\nscientists and with officials in other countries, which is important for\nlearning how the virus might be evolving as it spreads.\n\nThey are not actively monitoring infections in pigs, which are famously\neffective hosts for evolving flu viruses, and which are often kept in\nproximity to cattle. And officials have said they have \u201cno concern\u201d about the\nsafety of milk, despite a lack of hard data.\n\nIn joint statements in March, the U.S.D.A., the Food and Drug Administration\nand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assured the public that\npasteurized milk was safe. But the F.D.A. is still conducting tests to\nascertain whether the process eliminates the virus. The agency declined to say\nwhen results from those tests would be available.\n\nSome experts said the agencies should not have asserted that the milk is safe\nbefore they had the data in hand, even though there is only a slim chance of\nrisk to people.\n\n\u201cI understand that the milk market is very concerned about a loss of even a\nfew percent of milk consumption,\u201d said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious\ndisease expert at the University of Minnesota.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut, he added, \u201cthe idea that you can avoid this kind of discussion by just\ngiving absolutes is not going to serve them well.\u201d\n\nThe federal response so far echoes early missteps during the pandemic, he and\nother experts said. \u201cIt seems they learned little from the communication\nlessons that Covid taught us,\u201d Dr. Osterholm said.\n\nIn an interview this week, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, the U.S.D.A.\u2019s chief\nveterinarian, said that more than a dozen federal epidemiologists, roughly\ntwice as many laboratory employees, field staff members and academic and state\ncollaborators were all involved in the investigations.\n\n\u201cPlease recall that we\u2019ve been engaged in this for less than a month,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cWe are working very hard to generate more information.\u201d\n\nU.S.D.A. staff are analyzing only viral genetic sequences from sick cows, but\nwill release information for outside experts \u201cin the very, very near future,\u201d\nDr. Sifford said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe definitely recognize that we need to learn more about the overall\npicture,\u201d she added.\n\nImage\n\nInvestigating a dead porpoise for possible bird flu in Brazil in November.

Early data suggest that\nthere were at least two spillovers of the virus from bird to cow, in the Texas\nPanhandle and New Mexico, Dr. Sifford said.\n\nSo far among cattle, the virus, called H5N1, seems only to affect lactating\ncows, and only temporarily. There have been no diagnoses in calves, pregnant\nheifers or beef cows, and no deaths. But the virus appears to have spilled\nback, from cows to poultry, in at least one instance in Texas.\n\nThat infected herd and poultry flock were on different farms. But the virus\nmay have been transported between them by people or animals that had contact\nwith objects contaminated with virus-laden milk, according to the Texas Animal\nHealth Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nInfected cows appear to carry large amounts of the virus in their milk. (The\nU.S.D.A. has tested relatively few animals by nasal swab, however, and is not\ntesting feces, a common repository for viruses.)\n\nMilking equipment on dairy farms is typically deep-cleaned, but not\nsterilized, at least once a day. People milking cows are encouraged to wear\nsafety glasses, or masks or face shields, but the recommendations are often\nignored.\n\nIn cows sickened by H5N1, milk production drops sharply, and the milk becomes\nviscous and yellowish. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen something like this before,\u201d said Dr.\nKeith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\n(Milk from infected but asymptomatic cows seems unchanged, according to a\nspokeswoman for the North Carolina agriculture department.)\n\nIn interviews, some experts criticized the U.S.D.A.\u2019s testing recommendations,\nwhich until this week promised reimbursement only for a pool of animals that\nwere obviously ill. Farmers may not have found many infections simply because\nthey were not looking for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWidespread testing of animals with and without symptoms is crucial early in\noutbreaks to understand the scale and the possible mechanisms of viral\ntransmission, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins\nCenter for Health Security.\n\nImage\n\nA hen house on an egg farm in California was cleaned in January.Credit...Terry\nChea/Associated Press\n\nPigs are a linchpin in flu surveillance, many experts noted, as they are\nsusceptible to both bird and human flu. They might act as \u201cmixing bowls,\u201d\nenabling H5N1 to acquire the ability to spread efficiently among people.\n\nThe U.S.D.A. is not testing pigs or asking farmers to do so, Dr. Sifford said.\n\nTesting cows for H5N1 infection requires approval from a state official. Milk\nsamples obtained by an accredited veterinarian are typically packaged in\ntubes, packed in insulated coolers, and shipped to a U.S.D.A.-approved lab,\nalong with a unique identifier. Positive tests are then confirmed by the\nU.S.D.A.\u2019s national lab in Iowa.\n\nEach step slows the speedy response needed to contain an outbreak, Dr.\nInglesby said. Testing should be easy, free and accessible, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nDr. Sifford said the U.S.D.A. has already received a \u201csmall number\u201d of samples\nfrom cows without symptoms. The department is \u201cstrongly recommending testing\nbefore herds are moved between states, which includes asymptomatic herds,\u201d an\nagency statement said.\n\nAlready some state health departments and farmers have grown frustrated with\nthe federal approach. Several farms in Minnesota \u2014 not one of the eight states\nwith known cases \u2014 are sending samples of cow blood to private labs to test\nfor antibodies to the virus, which would indicate a current or past infection,\nsaid Dr. Joe Armstrong, a veterinarian at the University of Minnesota\nExtension.\n\nOther dairy farmers are reluctant to test, worried that fears about bird flu\ncould hurt their business, said Dr. Amy Swinford, director of the Texas A&M\nVeterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s many more dairies that have had this going on than what we\u2019ve\ngotten samples from,\u201d she said.\n\nDairy farmers are grappling with low milk prices and high feed costs, said\nRick Naerebout, chief executive of the Idaho Dairymen\u2019s Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already a very difficult economic situation, and then to look at\npossibly losing 20 percent of your revenue for a period of two to four weeks \u2014\nthat\u2019s really adding a lot of anxiousness to the situation,\u201d he said.\n\nIdaho barred the importation of cows from the Texas Panhandle after news of\nbird flu outbreak there, but a week too late. Having an infected herd in Idaho\ndespite those precautions \u201cwas kind of a gut shot,\u201d Mr. Naerebout said.\n\nMatt Herrick, a spokesman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said\nthat federal officials should provide more resources and equipment for farmers\nto protect themselves, and should publicize updates more widely, including\nthrough social media.\n\nThere is no mention of the bird flu outbreak on the U.S.D.A.\u2019s homepage. The\nlast outbreak-related announcement from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService, a division of the department, is dated April 2.\n\nThe U.S.D.A. is exploring vaccines to protect cattle from H5N1, but it is\nunclear how long it might take to develop them. Dr. Armstrong, of the\nUniversity of Minnesota Extension, said many farmers and veterinarians hope\nthe virus will \u201cburn itself out.\u201d\n\nInstead, it may become a long-term problem. \u201cThe goal is to prepare for that,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cNot for this wishful thinking of, \u2018It\u2019ll just go away.\u2019\u201d\n\nApoorva Mandavilli is a reporter focused on science and global health.
