start of rate cuts and any relief from sky-high borrowing costs.\n  * For consumers, it generally won\u2019t get less expensive to carry credit card debt, buy a house or purchase a car.\n  * \u201cPrioritizing debt repayment, especially of high-cost credit card debt, remains paramount as interest rates promise to remain high for some time,\u201d says Greg McBride, Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO3:3803:38\n\nOne interest rate cut in 2024 \u2018looks quite reasonable,\u2019 strategist says\n\nSquawk Box Europe\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced Wednesday it will leave interest rates unchanged\nas inflation continues to prove stickier than expected.\n\nHowever, the move also dashes hopes that the Fed will be able to start cutting\nrates soon and relieve consumers from sky-high borrowing costs.\n\nThe market is now pricing in one rate cut later in the year, according to the\nCME\u2019s FedWatch measure of futures market pricing. It started 2024 expecting at\nleast six reductions, which was \u201ccompletely fantasy land,\u201d said Greg McBride,\nchief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.\n\nThat change in rate-cut expectations leaves many households in a bind, he\nsaid. \u201cCertainly from a budgetary standpoint, not only is inflation still high\nbut that is on top of the cumulative increase in prices over the last three\nyears.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrioritizing debt repayment, especially of high-cost credit card debt,\nremains paramount as interest rates promise to remain high for some time,\u201d\nMcBride said.\n\nMore from Personal Finance: Cash savers still have an opportunity to beat\ninflation Here\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with TikTok\u2019s viral savings challenges The\nstrong U.S. job market is in a \u2018sweet spot,\u2019 economists say\n\nInflation has been a persistent problem since the Covid-19 pandemic, when\nprice increases soared to their highest levels since the early 1980s. The Fed\nresponded with a series of interest rate hikes that took its benchmark rate to\nits highest level in more than 22 years.\n\nThe federal funds rate, which is set by the U.S. central bank, is the rate at\nwhich banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that\u2019s not the\nrate consumers pay, the Fed\u2019s moves still affect the borrowing and savings\nrates they see every day.\n\nThe spike in interest rates caused most consumer borrowing costs to skyrocket,\nputting many households under pressure.\n\nIncreasing inflation has also been bad news for wage growth, as real average\nhourly earnings rose just 0.6% over the past year, according to the Labor\nDepartment\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEven with possible rate cuts on the horizon, consumers won\u2019t see their\nborrowing costs come down significantly, according to Columbia Business School\neconomics professor Brett House.\n\n\u201cOnce the Fed does cut rates, that could cascade through reductions in other\nrates but there is nothing that necessarily guarantees that,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom credit cards and mortgage rates to auto loans and savings accounts,\nhere\u2019s a look at where those rates could go in the second half of 2024.\n\n## Credit cards\n\nSince most credit cards have a variable rate, there\u2019s a direct connection to\nthe Fed\u2019s benchmark. In the wake of the rate hike cycle, the average credit\ncard rate rose from 16.34% in March 2022 to nearly 21% today \u2014 an all-time\nhigh.\n\nAnnual percentage rates will start to come down when the central bank reduces\nrates, but even then they will only ease off extremely high levels. With only\na few potential quarter-point cuts on deck, APRs aren\u2019t likely to fall much,\naccording to Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.\n\n\u201cIf Americans want lower interest rates, they\u2019re going to have to do it\nthemselves,\u201d he said. Try calling your card issuer to ask for a lower rate,\nconsolidating and paying off high-interest credit cards with a lower-interest\npersonal loan or switching to an interest-free balance transfer credit card,\nSchulz advised.\n\n## Mortgage rates\n\nAlthough 15- and 30-year mortgage rates are fixed, and tied to Treasury yields\nand the economy, anyone shopping for a new home has lost considerable\npurchasing power, partly because of inflation and the Fed\u2019s policy moves.\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is just above 7.3%, up\nfrom 4.4% when the Fed started raising rates in March 2022 and 3.27% at the\nend of 2021, according to Bankrate.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate and it\u2019s\nimpossible to say for certain where they\u2019ll end up,\u201d noted Jacob Channel,\nsenior economist at LendingTree. \u201cThat said, there\u2019s a good chance that we\u2019re\ngoing to need to get used to rates above 7% again, at least until we start\ngetting better economic news.\u201d\n\n## Auto loans\n\nEven though auto loans are fixed, payments are getting bigger because car\nprices have been rising along with the interest rates on new loans, resulting\nin less affordable monthly payments.\n\nThe average rate on a five-year new car loan is now more than 7%, up from 4%\nin March 2022, according to Edmunds. However, competition between lenders and\nmore incentives in the market lately have started to take some of the edge off\nthe cost of buying a car, said Ivan Drury, Edmunds\u2019 director of insights.\n\n\u201cAny reduction in rates will be especially welcome as there is an increasingly\nhigher share of consumers with older trade-ins that have sat out the market\nmadness waiting for an automotive landscape that looks more like the last time\nthey bought a vehicle six or seven years ago,\u201d Drury said.\n\n## Student loans\n\nFederal student loan rates are also fixed, so most borrowers aren\u2019t\nimmediately affected. But undergraduate students who took out direct federal\nstudent loans for the 2023-24 academic year are now paying 5.50%, up from\n4.99% in 2022-23 \u2014 and any loans disbursed after July 1 will likely be even\nhigher. Interest rates for the upcoming school year will be based on an\nauction of 10-Year Treasury notes later this month.\n\nPrivate student loans tend to have a variable rate tied to the prime, Treasury\nbill or another rate index, which means those borrowers are already paying\nmore in interest. How much more, however, varies with the benchmark.\n\nFor those struggling with existing debt, there are ways federal borrowers can\nreduce their burden, including income-based plans with $0 monthly payments and\neconomic hardship and unemployment deferments.\n\nPrivate loan borrowers have fewer options for relief \u2014 although some could\nconsider refinancing once rates start to come down, and those with better\ncredit may already qualify for a lower rate.\n\n## Savings rates\n\nWhile the central bank has no direct influence on deposit rates, the yields\ntend to be correlated to changes in the target federal funds rate.\n\nAs a result, top-yielding online savings account rates have made significant\nmoves and are now paying more than 5.5% \u2014 above the rate of inflation, which\nis a rare win for anyone building up a cash cushion, McBride said.\n\n\u201cThe mantra of higher-for-longer interest rates is music to the ears of savers\nwho will continue to enjoy inflation-beating returns on safe-haven savings\naccounts, money markets and CDs for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, top-yielding certificates of deposit pay over 5.5%, as good as or\nbetter than a high-yield savings account.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Wednesday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, 3M, Pinterest, AMD, Meta and more\n  * Apple reports earnings Thursday.
