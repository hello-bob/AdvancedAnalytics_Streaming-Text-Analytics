Government debt is significantly\ngreater and the geopolitical landscape is structurally different. The $3tn to\n$4tn it will cost each year come in a different macro environment.\u201d\n\nMalek predicted that the levels of investment required would put pressure on\ngovernments to step back from more aggressive energy policies. The Scottish\ngovernment on Thursday scrapped its ambitious plan to cut carbon emissions by\n75 per cent by 2030, conceding that the target was unachievable.\n\nIn its report, JPMorgan said changing the world\u2019s energy system \u201cis a process\nthat should be measured in decades, or generations, not years\u201d.\n\nIt added that investment in renewable energy \u201ccurrently offers subpar returns\u201d\nand that if energy prices rose strongly, there was even a risk of social\nunrest.\n\nThe report came after oil companies including Shell and BP trimmed back their\nclimate targets this year and hundreds of other companies, including\nMicrosoft, Unilever and JBS, failed to set goals that were ambitious enough to\nbe approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, a validation body set up\nafter the UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\n\nMalek noted that it was not guaranteed that demand for oil and gas would peak\nin 2030, as predicted by the International Energy Agency, as the populations\nof developing countries begin to buy more cars and take more flights.\n\nJPMorgan forecasts that the world will need 108mn barrels of oil a day in\n2030, and that building more wind, solar and electric vehicle capacity could\nadd a further 2mn daily barrels to this total.\n\n\u201cWe are at a tipping point in terms of demand,\u201d Malek said. \u201cMore and more of\nthe world is getting access to energy and a greater proportion want to use\nthat energy to upgrade their living standards. If that growth continues it\nputs huge pressure on energy systems and on governments.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan is a leading financier of fossil fuel projects and low-carbon energy\nprojects. The bank underwrote $101bn of fossil fuel deals in 2021 and 2022,\nand $71bn of low-carbon deals, according to data from BloombergNEF.\n\nChief executive Jamie Dimon told a congressional hearing In 2022 that the bank\nwould continue to invest in big oil and gas projects, saying that pulling out\nof such deals \u201cwould be the road to hell for America\u201d, and that the world was\nnot getting the energy transition right.\n\nKingsmill Bond, an energy strategist at the Rocky Mountain Institute, disputed\nJPMorgan\u2019s assertion that the cost of building renewables capacity was\nbecoming unaffordable, saying the annual growth of energy infrastructure\nspending will only be 2 per cent, as money is increasingly diverted from oil\nand gas projects into renewables.\n\n\u201cRenewable energy is much cheaper and more efficient than fossil fuel energy,\nwhich is why almost all electricity generation capacity now being built is\nsolar or wind,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparately, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said on Thursday that higher\ninterest rates would make the transition to a net zero global economy \u201ceven\nharder and more costly\u201d.\n\nPeter Martin, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s chief economist, said \u201cthe increased cost of\ncapital has profound implications for the energy and natural resource\nindustries\u201d, and that higher rates disproportionately affect renewables and\nnuclear power because of their high capital intensity and low returns.\n\nWood Mackenzie added that many companies in the oil and gas industry had low\nlevels of borrowing and would be relatively unaffected by higher rates.\n\n### Climate Capital\n\nWhere climate change meets business, markets and politics.
