This is a mistake. I don\u2019t think it will.\n\nPowerful forces have been raising housing prices for decades. But they are now\npetering out, even reversing. As time passes, housing prices might shrink.\n\nTo understand this, we need a very simple rule: the law of supply and demand.\n\nThis article refers mainly to developed economies.\n\n#\n\nHave Housing Prices Always Gone Up?\n\nNo.\n\nBut you wouldn\u2019t know that, because all your life, housing prices have grown:\n\nOur living memory of housing prices only goes back to the 1950s.1 In that\ntime, real housing prices2 have quadrupled.\n\nBut what happens if we look a bit farther back in time?\n\nPrices only started growing after 1950!\n\nData from even farther back gets a bit spottier because few countries have\ngood records, but the finding generally stands. This is Amsterdam:\n\nThis is for Belgian cities:\n\nUnfortunately the same paper doesn\u2019t show the same data after 1940, and\nlooking at other indicators is apples to oranges.\n\nHousing prices used to be very stable. So why did they grow so dramatically in\nrecent times?\n\nSimply because demand has outstripped supply.\n\n#\n\nA. Demand\n\nWhat drives the demand for housing?\n\n  1. More people\n\n  2. Who want to live in the same place: cities\n\n  3. Who generally want bigger houses\n\n  4. And who also might want fewer people living in the same household\n\nEach one of these four trends has been growing incredibly in the past few\ndecades, but is unlikely to keep growing and may even reverse.\n\n##\n\n1\\. Population Growth\n\nThe more people there are, the more housing we need to shelter them.\n\nIt\u2019s true that population has grown since we were hunter-gatherers, but it has\nexploded in recent times in ways we have a hard time fathoming:\n\nMore people meant more demand for housing. But will this trend continue? As\nyou can probably surmise, it won\u2019t.\n\nThe populations of Japan, China, and Europe are already shrinking.\n\nThe US is mainly growing because of immigration (which we\u2019ll discuss later),\nbut even there, the growth rate is going to be lower in the future than in the\npast. That is true for the entire world.\n\nOf course, all of this is driven by the fertility rate, which is shrinking all\nover the world, is already below replacement rate in most countries, and will\nlikely become the case in all of them.\n\nTo be explicit: More people means higher housing prices.\n\nThis is for the US. MSA means Metropolitan Statistical Area. I found a few\nmore graphs like this and then stopped looking for something more perfect,\nwhich would include many more countries for many more years. Feel free to\nshare if you find it. Source via this.\n\nOK so one of the biggest drivers of real estate price increases was simply\nmore people. But it\u2019s not just that. They also all wanted to live in the same\nplaces!\n\n##\n\n2\\. Urbanization\n\nSource\n\nMore and more people want to live in cities, but that\u2019s quite a recent\nphenomenon! In nearly all countries, by the middle of the 1800s, less than 20%\nof the population was urban!\n\nWhen everyone began moving to cities, demand on urban housing increased, and\nprices with them: the denser the area, the higher the prices.\n\nVia this\n\nThe urbanization rate can\u2019t keep increasing forever. When it went from ~10% in\n1800 to ~90% in 2020, that was a 9x increase. From there, at most it can reach\n100%, which is only a 10% increase. Therefore, this huge driver of demand for\nurban land that has existed for 200 years is now dead in developed countries,\nand might even revert given remote work.\n\nOK, so we used to have more people who wanted to live in the same place in the\nlast 200 years, and especially in the last 75.\n\nBut they also wanted to be less crowded!\n\n##\n\n3\\. Household Size\n\nThe number of people per household has shrunk dramatically over the last\ncouple of centuries:\n\nSource\n\nIf you zoom in on the most recent years, you\u2019ll see that this trend has\nstopped too, or even reverted. The drive to live in homes with fewer family\nmembers grew housing demand until the 1990s, but has barely contributed since.\n\nThe same is true in Europe, where household size (as in people per household)\nis even lower:\n\nWill we get to a world with one person per household? 0.5, if each person owns\nmore than one home? Maybe. But based on the trend of the last few decades, it\nlooks like this trend is now dead. Why? Because its main driver is family\nsize:\n\nAnd families can\u2019t get much smaller than a couple and half a child.3\n\nThey do want bigger houses though.\n\n##\n\n4\\. Bigger houses\n\nAs family sizes shrunk, house size grew.\n\nThis is how we arrived at houses with one room per child, coming from a world\nwhere we packed many people in one room.\n\nThis trend seems to be true in other rich countries.\n\nSince Europe and Japan have much smaller homes than the US, it is possible\nthat this trend still has room for growth in those places. Source.\n\nBut the more they grow, the less valuable each new square foot is. Yes, each\nperson can have a room and an office, but at some point they have enough empty\nrooms and don\u2019t want more. This trend will stop. And until then, it will\ndecelerate.\n\nIn other words: Over the last few decades, there have been:\n\n  1. More people\n\n  2. Moving to cities\n\n  3. Who increasingly want to live alone\n\n  4. In bigger houses\n\nThese trends meant there has been a huge increase in demand for housing land\nsince 1950. But now all these trends are stopping or reversing.4\n\nWhile demand grew, supply didn\u2019t keep up.\n\n#\n\nB. Supply\n\nOne inconvenient thing about houses is that they occupy volume. As a result,\nyou can only grow your supply of housing by growing horizontally or\nvertically.\n\n##\n\n1\\. Horizontal Supply and the Marchetti Constant\n\nIn How Transportation Technologies Shape Cities, I explained how the main\ndriver of city size is transportation technologies. It\u2019s easy to understand\nwhy: People don\u2019t like commuting more than 30 minutes\u2014the Marchetti Constant.\nWhen new transportation technologies speed up the commute, city footprints can\nincrease.\n\nAs such, city size was limited for thousands of years. Until the train\narrived, and then streetcars, bikes, and eventually cars.\n\nWhen your average commute speed goes from 5 km/h walking to 50 km/h by car,\nyou can travel 10x farther in 30 minutes, and the edge of a city is pushed 10x\nfarther.\n\nBut the land available increases by the square of that, making the city 100x\nbigger!\n\nThe result is that the car increased the supply of land for housing by 10-100x\ncompared to walking!\n\nBut that is only useful if you own a car. Car ownership has increased\ndramatically in the last 70 years:\n\nIn the US, we\u2019ve reached saturation: There are about two cars per household,\nand that number hasn\u2019t grown since the late 1980s.\n\nSource\n\nThis means nearly every household can have a car, nearly everybody can drive\nto work, and car ownership doesn\u2019t limit city size.\n\nConsequently, over the last few decades, cities stopped growing horizontally:\nThey had grown dramatically in the 1950s-2000s along with car ownership, until\nit wasn\u2019t a limiting factor anymore. The edges of cities was the limiting\nfactor.\n\nYou can probably get a sense of that in your daily life. When did your city\nsuburbs grow the most? Probably in the 1950s-2000s. After that, new suburbs\nwere ever farther from the city center, less compelling. This limited housing\nsupply, which drove prices up.\n\nBut this trend is now ending, because remote work has reduced commute time to\nzero, so cities\u2019 potential size is infinite.\n\n###\n\nRemote Work\n\nIf the car can allow people to live dozens of kilometers away from downtown\nbecause they can travel at 30-50 km per hour, what happens when they can\ntravel at 300,000 km per second? That\u2019s the speed of light, which is basically\nthe speed of your video call. When you work remotely, you are no longer\nlimited by the Marchetti constant. At most, you\u2019re limited by the timezone.\n\nWhereas Marchetti limited sizes to a few tens of kms around a city center to\nget to work, now the limit is continental: You don\u2019t need to move to Mountain\nView to work for Google. You can work from Patagonia.\n\nPeople couldn\u2019t work remotely until very recently. Now, they can get\nelectricity and Internet from virtually anywhere:\n\nWith Starlink, you can now get inexpensive Internet from virtually anywhere in\nthe world, and solar panels are becoming cheaper and cheaper.\n\nMany people will go to live in rural and semi-urban areas, where prices are\nlower, and safety and quality of life are higher. The entire world is now\npotential housing supply. What do you think that will do to housing prices in\nthe long run?\n\n##\n\n2\\. Vertical Supply and Sky Highways\n\nAt the very same time that transportation technology was increasing supply\nhorizontally, another type of technology was increasing the supply vertically:\nconstruction and elevators.\n\nUntil the 1800s, buildings were at most six floors tall because taller ones\nwould crumble under their own weight. But steel framing and reinforced\nconcrete changed that, technically allowing buildings to grow taller.\n\nChicago\u2019s Home Insurance Building is considered the first skyscraper in the\nworld, completed in 1885, with elevators to reach its 12 floors. It was not\nthe first building to use elevators, however. That had been introduced 30\nyears earlier in New York, by the inventor of the modern safety elevator,\nElisha Otis, using a steam engine.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to make them possible, another thing to make them enjoyable. In\nthe past, higher floors were for poor people because nobody wanted to climb\nsix flights of stairs.\n\nThe elevator, invented at the end of the 1900s, changed that. It allowed\npeople to reach any floor easily. Coupled with the advent of electricity and\nthings like water pumps for water access in high floors, elevators didn\u2019t just\nmake higher floors possible; they made them better. Now you\u2019d rather have the\npenthouse than the ground floor. This is only 100 years old.\n\nSize of the tallest building built every year between 1900 and 2018. Source.\n\nAs skyscrapers filled the skyline, people\u2019s dwellings ascended into the\nheights, and this new supply kept prices controlled in the first half of the\n20th century.\n\nThen, we stopped building up.\n\nEmail clipped? Continue here\n\n###\n\nNIMBYism\n\nParis built the Tour Eiffel. Then every Parisian thought it was ugly, and they\ndecided to stop building tall buildings. Later, in the skyscrapers craze, they\ndecided to build the Tour Montparnasse. They then thought it was ugly, and\nbanned all new skyscrapers\u2014they pushed them outside of the city, to La\nD\u00e9fense. A few decades later, construction started again, and stopped again.\nIf you live in a Western country, this might sound familiar to you.\n\nTicky-Flatty, AR\n\nThere are height restriction laws for buildings in most cities in Europe and\nNorth America. These have prevented buildings from growing up, limiting the\nsupply of housing, and driving prices up.5\n\nThis is the only data I could easily find. If you find more data, please\nshare. Spain has some of the densest cities in the Western world, I believe\ndue to high-density buildings built during the Franco dictatorship until 1975.\nSource: Long-term changes in 3D urban form in four Spanish cities, Domingo,\nVan Vliet, Hersperger\n\nThis trend might not change, in which case supply will remain restricted. But\nif it changes, will it be for more restriction, or more freedom?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be more restrictive than today, where many cities can\u2019t build\nanything, especially upwards. What is more likely is that building\nrestrictions will be reduced, pushed by the YIMBY movement (Yes In My\nBackYard). Tired of NIMBY, they started fighting back. Across the US, building\nrestrictions have been falling.\n\nADUs are Accessory Dwelling Units. Source.\n\nBuilding restrictions are also likely to be relaxed for another reason: As\ndemand shrinks, prices will drop, cities will compete to attract more people,\nand building restrictions are likely going to be relaxed.\n\nIf you have to bet whether restrictions are going to tighten or release, I\u2019d\nsay it\u2019s more likely they\u2019ll either stay the same or release, which means more\nsupply for housing, and lower prices.\n\n#\n\nBringing It Home\n\nUntil the Industrial Revolution, the population of most Western countries grew\nvery slowly.\n\nCities were small, most people lived in rural areas, and there was no such\nthing as \u201chousing prices\u201d that really mattered.\n\nVia this\n\nStarting in the 1800s, all these trends blew up. Populations exploded,\nurbanization exploded, people started getting crammed in urban homes...\n\nIn some places, prices exploded. But in many others, they didn\u2019t because as\ndemand went up, people simply settled around the tiny centers of existing\ncities. Soon, these cities could be built up and out thanks to technologies\nlike elevators, reinforced concrete, trains, and cars, adding floods of supply\nto the incessant demand for more housing.\n\nOver the last 75 years, demand for urban housing was driven by:\n\n  1. Higher population growth\n\n  2. More urbanization\n\n  3. More homes per person\n\n  4. Bigger homes\n\nBut supply ground to a halt horizontally and vertically:\n\n  1. Cities grew as much as they could horizontally and the edge of our car suburbs hit the Marchetti constant.\n\n  2. NIMBYs restricted building up, limiting supply\n\nNow, we\u2019re entering a world where all these trends are slowing down or\nreversing:\n\n  1. In demand:\n\n    1. The population is shrinking or soon will\n\n    2. Urbanization has reached its limits\n\n    3. We have all the homes we need per person. That growth is stopping.6\n\n    4. Homes keep getting bigger, but that trend is slowing every year\n\n  2. In supply:\n\n    1. Remote work eliminates the need to live close to work, which means the entire world becomes potential housing land supply\n\n    2. Building restrictions can\u2019t get any tighter, and will likely be relaxed\n\nWe\u2019re moving from a world where people have only experienced growing housing\nprices, to one where they are likely to shrink.\n\nDoes that sound like a world where real estate will be as good an investment\nas it used to be?\n\nNot to me. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t invest in real estate.\n\nShare\n\nOf course, there are more factors that influence real estate: housing vs\ncommercial, certain cities vs others, interest rates, beach properties,\nincome, immigration, home ownership, the timing of all of this, and more. I\nwill cover these in this week\u2019s premium article. I will also cover examples\nthat illustrate all these trends already happening. Subscribe to read it!\n\nYou will also get twice as many articles, and more importantly, you\u2019ll support\nme so I can keep writing articles like this one.\n\nNone of this is investment advice. Please don\u2019t invest based on this type of\narticle. You should consider this purely informational or entertainment. This\nis me sharing how I think about the problem, and nothing else. Please talk\nwith expert investment advisors before making important investment decisions.\n\n1\n\n99% of you reading this are most likely 95 years old or younger. You probably\ndidn\u2019t track housing prices until you were in your 20s. That means virtually\nall of you have only tracked the prices of housing in the last 75 years,\nmeaning 1950 and later.\n\n2\n\nThat is, controlling for inflation.\n\n3\n\nOr divorced parents of a single child. If they did, they would increase the\nnumber of houses per person, but the population would collapse faster, and\nhousing prices would plummet anyway.\n\n4\n\nExcept for house size: It\u2019s not completely stopping or reversing, but it is\ndecelerating. So it still counts as a contribution in reducing the growth in\ndemand.\n\n5\n\nThis is an interesting debate, because of course denser cities are more\nexpensive, which means that building more increases prices, rather than\ndecreasing them. But this is true in each individual city studied\nindependently: If one grows vertically and not another, it will have higher\ndensity, which will bring more wealth, so it will attract people from another\ncity that isn\u2019t growing as much. It\u2019s \u201cstealing wealth\u201d from the flatter city\ninto the taller city. But if instead of looking at cities individually, you\nlook at them as a whole\u2014say, an entire country\u2014then increasing height\neverywhere would release supply constraints and would reduce average housing\nprices. I will discuss this more in the premium article.\n\n6\n\nAlthough this is potentially not true in the future. We\u2019ll talk about it in\nthe premium article.\n\n### Subscribe to Uncharted Territories\n\nBy Tomas Pueyo \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nUnderstand the world of today to prepare for the world of tomorrow: AI, tech;\nthe future of democracy, energy, education, and more\n\n19 Likes\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why I Don\u2019t Invest in Real Estate\n\nunchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com\n\n6\n\nShare\n\n6 Comments\n\nKieran Garland3 hrs ago\u00b7edited 3 hrs agoafter the crash of 2008, an awful lot\nof money (one way or another) was transferred to much of the wealthiest in\nsociety, or in say developed economies, via the bailouts. now, even if you\ndon't, *they* invest in real estate, which is to say many of the wealthiest\nbought, and continue to buy, the homes of the middle class, your mum and dad's\nhomes, instead of their being able to buy them - i.e., the very wealthy often\nbuy n+ homes/buy-to-lets more or less ad infinitum. this too limits\nsupplythose properties become assets from which rents are perpetually\nincreased and extracted from all but the wealthiest. this is a strong part of\nthe dynamic that you may have missed, no? a key factor in why there's a\nhousing crisis in many developed economies (certainly at least in the UK). and\nit's another reason why supply is limited, demand is high, and many people are\nincreasingly angryi think the fact that certain economies have essentially now\nbecome generalised, asset-sweating economies means that what you own, rather\nthan what you produce, now defines your economic status, your class.anyway.\nhappy to have push back on this claim, am eager to better understand. great\npiece, cheersExpand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n5 replies by Tomas Pueyo and others\n\n5 more comments...\n\nMaps Distort How We See the World\n\n30 Maps to Rethink the World\n\nApr 20, 2023 \u2022\n\nTomas Pueyo\n\n452\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Maps Distort How We See the World\n\nunchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com\n\n48\n\nWho Can Claim Palestine?\n\nIsrael?
