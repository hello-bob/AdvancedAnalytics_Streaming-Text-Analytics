It can be used for anything from personal\nprojects to work tasks.\n\nUse cases:\n\n  * Personal projects: Can be used to keep track of personal projects and tasks.\n  * Work tasks: Can be used to keep track of work tasks and deadlines.\n  * To-do lists: Can be used to keep track of to-do lists and tasks.\n  * Project management: Can be used to keep track of project management tasks and deadlines.\n  * Product planning: Can be used to keep track of product planning tasks and deadlines.\n  * Personal goals: Can be used to keep track of personal goals and progress.\n  * Daily tasks: Can be used to keep track of daily tasks and progress.\n  * Habits: Can be used to keep track of habits and progress.\n\n### Let\u2019s build the structure\n\nUnderstanding the code:\n\n  * x-data=\"{ todos: [], newTodo: '', addTodo() { ... }, removeTodo(index) { ... }, initializeTodos() { ... } }\": This is the data that will be used to store the todos.\n  * @click=\"addTodo\": This is the event listener that will add a new todo when the button is clicked.\n  * x-model=\"newTodo\": This is the input that will be used to store the new todo.\n  * @keydown.enter=\"addTodo\": This is the event listener that will add a new todo when the enter key is pressed.\n  * x-for=\"(todo, index) in todos\": This is the loop that will be used to iterate over the todos.\n  * :key=\"index\": This is the key that will be used to uniquely identify each todo.\n  * <input type=\"checkbox\" x-model=\"todo.completed\">: This is the checkbox that will be used to mark each todo as completed or not.\n  * <span x-text=\"todo.text\" :class=\"{ 'line-through': todo.completed }\">: This is the text that will be used to display the text of each todo.\n  * <button @click=\"removeTodo(index)\">: This is the button that will be used to remove each todo.\n\nClasses are removed for brevity, but I\u2019ll keep those classes relveant to the\ntutorial.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ todos: [], newTodo: '', addTodo() { if (this.newTodo.trim() !== '') { this.todos.push({ text: this.newTodo, completed: false }); this.newTodo = ''; localStorage.setItem('todos', JSON.stringify(this.todos)); } }, removeTodo(index) { this.todos.splice(index, 1); localStorage.setItem('todos', JSON.stringify(this.todos)); }, initializeTodos() { const storedTodos = localStorage.getItem('todos'); if (storedTodos) { this.todos = JSON.parse(storedTodos); } } }\" x-init=\"initializeTodos\"> <!-- Input to add new todo --> <div> <button @click=\"addTodo\" >Add</button > <input type=\"text\" x-model=\"newTodo\" @keydown.enter=\"addTodo\" /> </div> <!-- List of todos --> <ul> <template x-for=\"(todo, index) in todos\" :key=\"index\"> <li > <div > <div> <input type=\"checkbox\" x-model=\"todo.completed\" /> <span x-text=\"todo.text\" :class=\"{ 'line-through': todo.completed }\" ></span> </div> <button @click=\"removeTodo(index)\" ><svg> <!-- SVG Path --> </svg> </button> </div> </li> </template> </ul> </div>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a simple TODO app that can be used to keep track of tasks and\nprioritize them.
