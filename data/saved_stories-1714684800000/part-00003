At least, that\u2019s a new fear that some\nscientists have raised, citing a stark rise in suspicious AI shibboleths\nshowing up in published papers.\n\nSome of these tells\u2014such as the inadvertent inclusion of \u201ccertainly, here is a\npossible introduction for your topic\u201d in a recent paper in Surfaces and\nInterfaces, a journal published by Elsevier\u2014are reasonably obvious evidence\nthat a scientist used an AI chatbot known as a large language model (LLM). But\n\u201cthat\u2019s probably only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d says scientific integrity\nconsultant Elisabeth Bik. (A representative of Elsevier told Scientific\nAmerican that the publisher regrets the situation and is investigating how it\ncould have \u201cslipped through\u201d the manuscript evaluation process.) In most other\ncases AI involvement isn\u2019t as clear-cut, and automated AI text detectors are\nunreliable tools for analyzing a paper.\n\nResearchers from several fields have, however, identified a few key words and\nphrases (such as \u201ccomplex and multifaceted\u201d) that tend to appear more often in\nAI-generated sentences than in typical human writing. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve looked at\nthis stuff long enough, you get a feel for the style,\u201d says Andrew Gray, a\nlibrarian and researcher at University College London.\n\nLLMs are designed to generate text\u2014but what they produce may or may not be\nfactually accurate. \u201cThe problem is that these tools are not good enough yet\nto trust,\u201d Bik says. They succumb to what computer scientists call\nhallucination: simply put, they make stuff up. \u201cSpecifically, for scientific\npapers,\u201d Bik notes, an AI \u201cwill generate citation references that don\u2019t\nexist.\u201d So if scientists place too much confidence in LLMs, study authors risk\ninserting AI-fabricated flaws into their work, mixing more potential for error\ninto the already messy reality of scientific publishing.\n\nGray recently hunted for AI buzzwords in scientific papers using Dimensions, a\ndata analytics platform that its developers say tracks more than 140 million\npapers worldwide. He searched for words disproportionately used by chatbots,\nsuch as \u201cintricate,\u201d \u201cmeticulous\u201d and \u201ccommendable.\u201d These indicator words, he\nsays, give a better sense of the problem\u2019s scale than any \u201cgiveaway\u201d AI phrase\na clumsy author might copy into a paper. At least 60,000 papers\u2014slightly more\nthan 1 percent of all scientific articles published globally last year\u2014may\nhave used an LLM, according to Gray\u2019s analysis, which was released on the\npreprint server arXiv.org and has yet to be peer-reviewed. Other studies that\nfocused specifically on subsections of science suggest even more reliance on\nLLMs. One such investigation found that up to 17.5 percent of recent computer\nscience papers exhibit signs of AI writing.\n\nAmanda Monta\u00f1ez; Source: Andrew Gray\n\nThose findings are supported by Scientific American\u2019s own search using\nDimensions and several other scientific publication databases, including\nGoogle Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, OpenAlex and Internet Archive Scholar. This\nsearch looked for signs that can suggest an LLM was involved in the production\nof text for academic papers\u2014measured by the prevalence of phrases that ChatGPT\nand other AI models typically append, such as \u201cas of my last knowledge\nupdate.\u201d In 2020 that phrase appeared only once in results tracked by four of\nthe major paper analytics platforms used in the investigation. But it appeared\n136 times in 2022. There were some limitations to this approach, though: It\ncould not filter out papers that might have represented studies of AI models\nthemselves rather than AI-generated content. And these databases include\nmaterial beyond peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals.\n\nLike Gray\u2019s approach, this search also turned up subtler traces that may have\npointed toward an LLM: it looked at the number of times stock phrases or words\npreferred by ChatGPT were found in the scientific literature and tracked\nwhether their prevalence was notably different in the years just before the\nNovember 2022 release of OpenAI\u2019s chatbot (going back to 2020). The findings\nsuggest something has changed in the lexicon of scientific writing\u2014a\ndevelopment that might be caused by the writing tics of increasingly present\nchatbots. \u201cThere\u2019s some evidence of some words changing steadily over time\u201d as\nlanguage normally evolves, Gray says. \u201cBut there\u2019s this question of how much\nof this is long-term natural change of language and how much is something\ndifferent.\u201d\n\n## Symptoms of ChatGPT\n\nFor signs that AI may be involved in paper production or editing, Scientific\nAmerican\u2019s search delved into the word \u201cdelve\u201d\u2014which, as some informal\nmonitors of AI-made text have pointed out, has seen an unusual spike in use\nacross academia. An analysis of its use across the 37 million or so citations\nand paper abstracts in life sciences and biomedicine contained within the\nPubMed catalog highlighted how much the word is in vogue. Up from 349 uses in\n2020, \u201cdelve\u201d appeared 2,847 times in 2023 and has already cropped up 2,630\ntimes so far in 2024\u2014a 654 percent increase. Similar but less pronounced\nincreases were seen in the Scopus database, which covers a wider range of\nsciences, and in Dimensions data.\n\nOther terms flagged by these monitors as AI-generated catchwords have seen\nsimilar rises, according to the Scientific American analysis: \u201ccommendable\u201d\nappeared 240 times in papers tracked by Scopus and 10,977 times in papers\ntracked by Dimensions in 2020. Those numbers spiked to 829 (a 245 percent\nincrease) and 20,536 (an 87 percent increase), respectively, in 2023. And in a\nperhaps ironic twist for would-be \u201cmeticulous\u201d research, that word doubled on\nScopus between 2020 and 2023.\n\n## More Than Mere Words\n\nIn a world where academics live by the mantra \u201cpublish or perish,\u201d it\u2019s\nunsurprising that some are using chatbots to save time or to bolster their\ncommand of English in a sector where it is often required for publication\u2014and\nmay be a writer\u2019s second or third language. But employing AI technology as a\ngrammar or syntax helper could be a slippery slope to misapplying it in other\nparts of the scientific process. Writing a paper with an LLM co-author, the\nworry goes, may lead to key figures generated whole cloth by AI or to peer\nreviews that are outsourced to automated evaluators.\n\nThese are not purely hypothetical scenarios. AI certainly has been used to\nproduce scientific diagrams and illustrations that have often been included in\nacademic papers\u2014including, notably, one bizarrely endowed rodent\u2014and even to\nreplace human participants in experiments. And the use of AI chatbots may have\npermeated the peer-review process itself, based on a preprint study of the\nlanguage in feedback given to scientists who presented research at conferences\non AI in 2023 and 2024. If AI-generated judgments creep into academic papers\nalongside AI text, that concerns experts, including Matt Hodgkinson, a council\nmember of the Committee on Publication Ethics, a U.K.-based nonprofit\norganization that promotes ethical academic research practices. Chatbots are\n\u201cnot good at doing analysis,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s where the real danger\nlies.\u201d\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is a freelance journalist in Newcastle, UK.\n\nMore by Chris Stokel-Walker\n\n# Popular Stories\n\nAnimals April 25, 2024\n\n##\n\nWe Are in the Golden Age of Bird-Watching\n\nThere has never been a better time to be or become a birder\n\nKate Wong\n\nOpinion April 29, 2024\n\n##\n\nThere Are Safer Ways to Bed-Share with a Baby\n\nFor some parents, bed-sharing is the only way their baby can sleep.
