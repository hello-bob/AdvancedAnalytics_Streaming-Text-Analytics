It gives you\nthe right tools to do almost everything with your device. The installation is\nvery simple and doesn't require great background knowledge.\n\n## Features\n\nZentrox will offer many features for different purposes:\n\n  * File sharing protocols\n  * Package manager\n  * Storage & Files overview\n  * System resource measurement\n  * Web shell\n\n###### Italic means, that the feature is not fully implemented yet.\n\n## Installation\n\nImportant\n\nZentrox is still in development. At the time, many parts of the application\nare not done and properly tested. If you want to see, what the current state\nis, you can test it using the commands bellow. Please do not ignore any\ndisclaimers, as you may break your system. You can also run it in a VM.\n\nZentrox only supports Linux at the time. You can use the script bellow to\ninstall Zentrox on your system. It will auto generate a .key and .crt file for\nHTTPS support. If you already have a .key and .crt, please copy it to the\nfolder and call it selfsigned.crt / selfsigned.key.\n\n### Requirements\n\n  * NodeJS 18+\n  * git\n  * npm\n  * Linux\n\n### Installing\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://github.com/Wervice/zentrox/ # Clones Codelink repo to current folder cd ~/zentrox # Got to zentrox_server folder npm install express body-parser cookie-parser express-session node-os-utils ejs # Install node_packages openssl genrsa -out selfsigned.key 2048 openssl req -new -key selfsigned.key -out csr.pem openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in csr.pem -signkey selfsigned.key -out selfsigned.crt clear node index.js # Run zentrox main JS\n\nAfter installing Zentrox, it will store it the server code in ~/zentrox and\nthe config, user data... in ~/zentrox_data\n\nZentrox will now be hosted on https://localhost:3000.\n\nDepending on your your .crt and .key file, you may be prompted with a warning\nabout the connection being insecure. You can ignore this. If you want to, you\ncan get an official certificate for this, but your connection will still be\nfairly safe without one.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter rebooting the server or closing Zentrox, you can restart it using:\n\n    \n    \n    cd ~/zentrox # Go to Zentrox code folder node index.js # Start zentrox\n\nYou can now login to Zentrox using your admin credentials.\n\n# Why...\n\n## ... JavaScript?\n\nJavaScript is a very fast and extensible language. It features most of the\nthings I was looking for and doesn't stress the hardware it runs on to much.\n\n## ... C?\n\nZentrox also uses C to speed up certain tasks. C had the libraries and\nfeatures I needed to change the system.\n\n## ... Express?\n\nExpress is very fast and small. It can be extended using libraries. In\naddition to that, it also is very fast and lightweight on the system.\n\n## Removing\n\nYou can remove Zentrox by deleting the zentrox_server folder. If you also want\nto erase all user & admin data, you can remove zentrox_data.\n\nImportant\n\nYou can not restore your data using Zentrox after removing it once.\n\n### System changes\n\nZentrox changes a few configurations on your system, so it will work properly.\nThese are:\n\n#### FTP\n\n  1. Installing vsftpd and ufw\n  2. Enabling ufw\n  3. Allowing port 20 and 21 using ufw for FTP\n  4. Creating an FTP user called ftp_zentrox (This will change, if you change the user later using zentrox; The user has the default password change_me and not shell access) The user will also get no home folder\n  5. Changing /etc/vsftpd.conf (The last few lines after the last comment)\n\n     * Use vsftpd.userlist\n     * Set local root to / (you can change that later)\n     * Enable userlist\n     * Sub token user to $USER\n  6. Stopping / Starting vsftpd\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou can contribute this project in many ways. I am happy about any feedback.\nIf you found a bug, please open an issue and I will try to fix it. Also, you\nare very welcome to star this project.\n\n## Legal\n\nCodelink is released under Apache 2.0\n\nCodelink uses/requires the following resources: Icons8 Icons icons8.com VSFTPD\nas an FTP server https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html (Has not been\nmodified)\n\n## About\n\nAdministrate your server using a convenient and reliable web based interface\nwith a robust self-hosted back end.
