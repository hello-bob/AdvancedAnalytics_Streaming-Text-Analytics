However,\ncontrary to Cremieux, I suspect that biology is dominant.\n\nHere\u2019s why. Most traits have a null or near null shared environmentability\ncomponent. This component is essentially a measure of how much differences in\nparental behavior between families effect a trait. If parental behavior\nbetween families doesn\u2019t have impact on a trait, then parental behavior\nvarying by child within a family will probably not affect that child\u2019s trait.\n\nCremieux basically repeats Inquisitive Bird\u2019s recent error. Most traits do not\nrespond to differences in parental behavior, but both of these writers focus\non rare exceptions to that general rule, and from exception they theorize that\nthe rule does not exist.\n\nCremieux\u2019s conclusion in his article is:\n\n> There may be some birth order effects that are attributable to mutational\n> load, but whatever they are isn\u2019t clear to me. From the vantage point of\n> designs leveraging phlogistonal differences, adoptions, and taking on\n> different spouses, birth order effects on educational attainment and\n> achievement look to be both real, replicable, and not attributable to\n> mutational load. ... So far, mutational load doesn\u2019t seem like it explains\n> any birth order effects of note.\n\nBolding is mine, and it highlights his reasoning. Cremieux generalized from\noutlier traits to everything. The shared environmentability of educational\nattainment is 40%. This is much higher than the shared environmentability of\nIQ, leftism, ADHD, schizophrenia, and so on. For all of these traits, there\nare documented birth order effects, and varying degrees of evidence that they\nare driven by paternal age, i.e. mutational load.\n\n##\n\nADHD\n\nSource\n\nThe heritability of ADHD is 100% when adjusted for measurement noise (h^2 =\n2(.7 - .2) = 1, but MZ twins correlate at .7 instead of 1), and the shared\nenvironmentability is 0.\n\nSource\n\nYet there is a paternal age effect on ADHD, similar in magnitude to the ones\nmeasured for IQ and leftism (r ~= .10). It\u2019s extremely unlikely this could\ncome from parental behavior. The estimate above uses family fixed effects, so\nit doesn\u2019t come from differences between younger fathers and older fathers (it\nwould seem from the chart that ADHD fathers breed younger, obscuring the\neffect in a simple design).\n\nFrom the same study:\n\nThis is the only set of results from the study where the family fixed effects\ndeviates from the linearity that mutational load theory predicts.\n\nI think there is a mutational load effect on education, but it\u2019s covered up by\nparental compensation. This theory is supported by Cremiuex\u2019s first citation\nin his article, and explains the rest of the results he presents, while also\nallowing for there to be a paternal age effect on IQ, which correlates with\neducation measures weakly to moderately.\n\nWhether there is a mutational load effect component on education or not, you\ncan clearly see that Cremieux picked the least representative trait to\ngeneralize from. Of 7 or 8 different traits from the study I\u2019m citing,\nCremieux picked the 1 or 2 that deviate from mutational load theory, and then\ngeneralized from this. (I doubt he literally plucked education from this\nstudy, but you get my point \u2014 the broader picture is missing from his\narticle).\n\n##\n\nLeftism and IQ\n\nThe p values are bad, but for leftism and IQ , independent paternal age\neffects haven\u2019t been falsified. They also aren\u2019t fully verified due to massive\nunderstudying of how these traits evolve. This understudying is insane because\nit\u2019s easy to argue that these are the two most important traits.\n\nBut there do seem to be paternal age effects on IQ and leftism. It stands to\nreason that this is more likely to be due to mutational load the lower the\nshared environmentality of these traits are.\n\nSource\n\nSource\n\nIQ\u2019s shared environmentality is much less than that of educational attainment\n(15% vs. 40%). Conservatism\u2019s is 0 when your IQ is greater than 100 and you\u2019re\nan adult. As IQ decreases, parental influence goes up, but not the the levels\nof educational attainment. Overall, it was estimated at 5.4% for the\npopulation.\n\nSo a paternal age effect on IQ is unlikely to be due to environmental birth\norder effects, and a paternal age effect on leftism is even more unlikely to\nbe due to environmental birth order effects.\n\nUnder reasonable priors, we must disagree with Cremieux. Mutational load DOES\nseem like it explains MANY birth order effects of note.\n\n##\n\nSSSM Priors\n\nSo what drove Cremieux to make what I consider to be mistakes?\n\nSource\n\nIf you look at Cremieux\u2019s work, he likes to talk about phlogiston (\u201cculture\u201d)\na lot! In fact, I thought he would take this position if he wrote on this\ntopic because of his positions on stuff like \u201cthe importance of culture\u201d.\nClearly this goes beyond the evidence we\u2019ve been passing around \u2014 frankly a\nlot of research on this topic is still ambiguous to a degree and therefore has\nto be informed by priors much more than is the case in the race and IQ field.\n\nAnd what priors are those? See the table above. Cremieux believes, without any\nfirm falsifying evidence, that with respect to birth order effects and other\nareas of human behavior, that \u201cBiology is relatively unimportant in\nunderstanding behavior.\u201d\n\nObviously, Cremieux is not as SSSM as non-HBD people. But he\u2019s more SSSM than\nme. SSSM is a spectrum. And within the HBD scene, there are differences in\ngeneral SSSM priors, there\u2019s just less variance than in the general\npopulation. I believe these differences within HBD drive within group\ndisagreements on relatively niche topics like mutational load.\n\nI believe that biology is always the null hypothesis, and that good falsifying\nevidence must be provided for any special exceptions to this general rule.\nTherefore, I could never say something like \u201cNeedlessly Invoking Biology\u201d,\nwhich is what Cremiuex writes of mutational load theory with respect to birth\norder effects.\n\nIt\u2019s near certain mutational load explains birth order effects like ADHD.\nInvoking biology is never needless \u2014 it\u2019s the default that research on birth\norder effects should revolve around. My priors go even beyond the integrated\nmodel \u2014 I would say \u201cUnderstanding genetic effects is absolutely critical to\nunderstanding nearly all human behavior and its variation.\u201d With this in mind,\nlet\u2019s review his evidence as hereditarians.\n\nHe begins by mentioning that parents tend to compensate for their children\u2019s\nflaws by putting more effort into less abled children. If this is the case,\nthen we should expect mutational load effects to be attenuated by greater\nparental effort any time a trait responds to such effort. This is important to\nnote because now we have a model where there are competing pressures on birth\norder effects. They may cancel each other out partially or totally.\n\nWith this in mind, Cremieux seems to post data that shows the opposite \u2014 older\nparents environmentally persuade kids to go to college less. Perhaps going to\ncollege is bad? Bryan Caplan would argue this. This chart also shows that\nthere is indeed no need to invoke biology. But biology isn\u2019t falsified \u2014 if\nhigher paternal age drives equal paternal compensation toward college, but\nolder mothers are less active in their kid\u2019s lives due to declining energy and\nso on, we would expect to see this. 3 effects, 1 affects adoptees and the\nother two cancel each other out in line with Cremieux\u2019s parental compensation\ndata and the broader research on mutational load effects.\n\nMy theory here also explains this chart. Older fathers fully compensate\nbehaviorally for their later children\u2019s lower IQs, but older mothers actually\ndecline in effort leading to their later children attending college less.\n\nFinally, race differences (which are probably genetic) in compensatory\nbehavior and mutation rate (this book discusses how mutation rate is evolving.\nIf it\u2019s evolving it\u2019s heritable, and if it\u2019s heritable, there will likely be\ngenetic differences between races) can explain this chart. Have you heard of\nEast Asian tiger moms? Remember my theory above about white mothers losing\neffort? Maybe East Asian mothers don\u2019t do that. Maybe Indian mothers increase\nis parenting behavior as they age.\n\n##\n\nOccam\u2019s razor\n\nAt first glance, what I just did violates Occam\u2019s razor. Cremieux appears to\nhave a theory with exactly 2 less moving parts. But my theory is more\nlogically coherent and fits the broader body of evidence better \u2014 \u201ctheories\nshall be as simple as possible, but no simpler than that.\u201d Cremieux\u2019s theory\nis not fit for explaining everything that my priors are built on, so we need\nmore complexity.\n\nThis will sound unconvincing to people who don\u2019t share my priors. Maintaining\nmy moderate usage of their lingo in this article, the Bay Area Rationalists\nblamed this on something called inferential distance. My priors are informed\nby everything I know, plus my genetics, so we run into an issue. People who\nwould respond well to knowing more are probably light readers, unless they\u2019re\nvery young or new to the space. Therefore, they won\u2019t want to read everything\nI\u2019ve ever written and a few other books. The distance remains. Everyone else\nwho still disagrees probably does so because their inherited starting point is\na lot different than mine, because they\u2019ve been exposed to all of the same\ninformation as me.\n\n##\n\nMore data\n\nIf elites like Cremieux are information saturated, meaning evaluations have\nextremely high heritability, then more data is the only way to achieve a\nconsensus on a topic. More data doesn\u2019t have to work. In general, if someone\nis convinced by the black-white IQ data, then I think they will be convinced\nof mutational load by more data. But if they are still denying black-white IQ\ngap stuff, don\u2019t count on them accepting mutational load even with excellent\ndata. Cremieux, I believe, will be convinced by better data if my predictions\nare right \u2014 Kevin Bird, probably not.\n\nAs I said earlier, it\u2019s easy to argue IQ and leftism are the two most\nimportant traits. Proving mutation driven paternal age effects for these two\ntraits will therefore do a lot more to show that mutational load is important.\n\nTo do this, we need family level data \u2014 because of the low c^2 of leftism\namong the top 50% of the population, this should be enough for leftism is we\ndo something like taking college educated families.\n\nMore than this, if we could use family level gene sequencing to measure the\nnumber of de novo mutations in offspring (paternal age only reflects the\nexpected number), then we could correlate this variable controlled for\nparental age, birth order, and so on. We could also check the effect of the\nmutations on PGSs, but this is likely not possible to do currently due to\nmissing heritability.\n\nIf you would like to give your energy to me to one day get such a study done,\nplease subscribe:\n\nJoseph Bronski is a reader-supported publication.

When I\nwould use it, I replace it with \u201cbehavior\u201d, \u201cpopulation\u201d, \u201crace\u201d,\n\u201cinformation\u201d, \u201cmeme\u201d, \u201cmemome\u201d, or \u201cgenetics\u201d most of the time. It can also\nbe replaced with \u201cart\u201d, \u201cextended phenotype\u201d, \u201ctechnology\u201d, and \u201ctools\u201d in\nsome cases, etc up to over 150 cases. When someone else uses it, instead of\ndoing their work for them, I just replace it with phlogiston, the unseen\nsubstance people used to claim caused fire. This is fitting because \u201cculture\u201d\nis just as vague and just as mystical, with many weakly implying it exists\nsomehow metaphysically as an unmeasurable and underlying determinant of\nwhatever more specific word they\u2019re using it in place of.\n\n### Subscribe to Joseph Bronski\n\nLaunched 2 years ago\n\nThe hub for all of the works of Joseph Bronski.\n\n2 Likes\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Birth Order: Mutational Load or Environment?\n\nwww.josephbronski.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nOldManFlappyNuts3 hrs agohttps://open.substack.com/pub/aporiamagazine/p/can-\nmutation-load-explain-the-rise?r=1bt0wh&utm_medium=iosAre you going to respond\nto thisExpand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Joseph Bronski\n\n1 more comment...\n\nLeftism has happened before\n\nExamining the evidence for the leftism cycle\n\nJan 8 \u2022\n\nJoseph Bronski\n\n44\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Leftism has happened before\n\nwww.josephbronski.com\n\n29\n\nHow much of the Black-White IQ Gap is Genetics?\n\nA lot.\n\nOct 1, 2023 \u2022\n\nJoseph Bronski\n\n42\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How much of the Black-White IQ Gap is Genetics?\n\nwww.josephbronski.com\n\n5\n\nExousiology Manuscript Beta 1.0 is out!\n\nThe first version of the living document that will become the book.\n\nNov 26, 2022 \u2022\n\nJoseph Bronski\n\n20\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Exousiology Manuscript Beta 1.0 is out!\n\nwww.josephbronski.com\n\n2\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Joseph Bronski\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
