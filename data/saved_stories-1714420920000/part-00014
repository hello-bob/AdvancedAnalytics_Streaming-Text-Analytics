These semiconducting\nmaterials, known as copper oxides, are cheap, abundant and non-toxic, but\ntheir performance does not come close to silicon, which dominates the\nsemiconductor market.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that by growing the copper oxide crystals in a\nspecific orientation so that electric charges move through the crystals at a\ndiagonal, the charges move much faster and further, greatly improving\nperformance. Tests of a copper oxide light harvester, or photocathode, based\non this fabrication technique showed a 70% improvement over existing state-of-\nthe-art oxide photocathodes, while also showing greatly improved stability.\n\nThe researchers say their results, reported in the journal Nature, show how\nlow-cost materials could be fine-tuned to power the transition away from\nfossil fuels and toward clean, sustainable fuels that can be stored and used\nwith existing energy infrastructure.\n\n#### Challenges and Potential in Cuprous Oxide\n\nCopper (I) oxide, or cuprous oxide, has been touted as a cheap potential\nreplacement for silicon for years, since it is reasonably effective at\ncapturing sunlight and converting it into electric charge. However, much of\nthat charge tends to get lost, limiting the material\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cLike other oxide semiconductors, cuprous oxide has its intrinsic challenges,\u201d\nsaid co-first author Dr Linfeng Pan from Cambridge\u2019s Department of Chemical\nEngineering and Biotechnology. \u201cOne of those challenges is the mismatch\nbetween how deep light is absorbed and how far the charges travel within the\nmaterial, so most of the oxide below the top layer of material is essentially\ndead space.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor most solar cell materials, it\u2019s defects on the surface of the material\nthat causes a reduction in performance, but with these oxide materials, it\u2019s\nthe other way round: the surface is largely fine, but something about the bulk\nleads to losses,\u201d said Professor Sam Stranks, who led the research. \u201cThis\nmeans the way the crystals are grown is vital to their performance.\u201d\n\nTo develop cuprous oxides to the point where they can be a credible contender\nto established photovoltaic materials, they need to be optimized so they can\nefficiently generate and move electric charges \u2013 made of an electron and a\npositively-charged electron \u2018hole\u2019 \u2013 when sunlight hits them.\n\n#### Impact and Future Directions\n\nOne potential optimization approach is single-crystal thin films \u2013 very thin\nslices of material with a highly-ordered crystal structure, which are often\nused in electronics. However, making these films is normally a complex and\ntime-consuming process.\n\nUsing thin film deposition techniques, the researchers were able to grow high-\nquality cuprous oxide films at ambient pressure and room temperature. By\nprecisely controlling growth and flow rates in the chamber, they were able to\n\u2018shift\u2019 the crystals into a particular orientation. Then, using high temporal\nresolution spectroscopic techniques, they were able to observe how the\norientation of the crystals affected how efficiently electric charges moved\nthrough the material.\n\n\u201cThese crystals are basically cubes, and we found that when the electrons move\nthrough the cube at a body diagonal, rather than along the face or edge of the\ncube, they move an order of magnitude further,\u201d said Pan. \u201cThe further the\nelectrons move, the better the performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething about that diagonal direction in these materials is magic,\u201d said\nStranks. \u201cWe need to carry out further work to fully understand why and\noptimise it further, but it has so far resulted in a huge jump in\nperformance.\u201d Tests of a cuprous oxide photocathode made using this technique\nshowed an increase in performance of more than 70% over existing state-of-the-\nart electrodeposited oxide photocathodes.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the improved performance, we found that the orientation makes\nthe films much more stable, but factors beyond the bulk properties may be at\nplay,\u201d said Pan.\n\nThe researchers say that much more research and development is still needed,\nbut this and related families of materials could have a vital role in the\nenergy transition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go, but we\u2019re on an exciting trajectory,\u201d said\nStranks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interesting science to come from these materials,\nand it\u2019s interesting for me to connect the physics of these materials with\ntheir growth, how they form, and ultimately how they perform.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cHigh carrier mobility along the [111] orientation in Cu2O\nphotoelectrodes\u201d by Linfeng Pan, Linjie Dai, Oliver J.
