(Part 1 of 2)\n\nBy Ted Gioia\n\nThis book is about strange trips. This book is a strange trip.\n\nI started by analyzing an ancient Macedonian papyrus from Derveni\u2014the oldest\nsurviving book in Europe\u2014which told readers how to use magical songs to\nsurvive dangerous journeys. And I\u2019ve somehow ended up in Hollywood.\n\nBut this makes perfect sense. The brand franchises of movie moguls have their\nroots in those magical songs of ancient heroes. The only difference is that\nthe author of the Derveni papyrus wanted everybody to possess the magic.\n\nYou can be the hero on a transformative journey. Everybody is allowed to sing\nthese life-changing songs.\n\nHollywood reverses all this. The hero only exists on screen, not in real life.\nYou just sit in the audience as an observer\u2014after buying a ticket and\noverpriced popcorn. The magical song is reduced to a soundtrack theme. You can\nlisten, but you don\u2019t sing along. Not even buying a ticket gives you that\nright.\n\nThese are not small differences, although perhaps the mismatch here is\ninevitable. The heroic possibilities in human life simply don\u2019t meet the needs\nof the entertainment industry.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of a favorite passage in a David Foster Wallace story, when a\nburnt-out young man\u2014he describes himself as a wastoid\u2014is shaken out of his\ncomplacency by (of all people) an accounting professor.\n\nThis teacher berates his students, demanding that they aspire to heroism\u2014but\n\u201cnot heroism as you might know it from films or the tales of childhood. . . .\nThe truth is that the heroism of your childhood entertainments was not true\nvalor. It was theater.\u201d\n\nGrown-ups, he continues, must learn what real heroism is. The professor goes\non to define it\u2014in a way that both unsettled and inspired me when I first read\nit:\n\n> \u201cWelcome to the world of reality\u2014there is no audience. No one to applaud, to\n> admire. No one to see you. Do you understand? Here is the truth\u2014actual\n> heroism receives no ovation, entertains no one. . . . True heroism is\n> minutes, hours, weeks, year upon year of the quiet, precise, judicious\n> exercise of probity and care\u2014with no one there to see and cheer. This is the\n> world.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018wastoid protagonist eventually finds fulfillment as a Certified Public\nAccount working for the IRS. It seems absurd\u2014accountancy can\u2019t offer a heroic\nlife, no?\u2014and Wallace knows that. But he\u2019s also deadly serious about what he\u2019s\nsaying here. Even more to the point, no Hollywood studio could ever make a\nfilm out of this story, and for the very reason the professor outlines:\n\nNobody would be entertained.\n\nAll that might be fine, at least from the standpoint of the movie business.\nBut the curious fact remains that Hollywood itself is uneasy at this state of\naffairs. The filmmakers know how fake their hero tales really are\u2014and I\u2019m not\njust talking about the stunts and computer generated effects. The plots and\ncharacters are bogus in every way.\n\nThey struggle to make movies about the real heroism of everyday life. They\nrecognize how unsuitable \u201cthe quiet, precise, judicious exercise of probity\nand care\u201d is for the mass market\u2014yet those are the stories that most need to\nbe told.\n\nThis creates a cognitive dissonance in pop culture. Hollywood wants to bring\nmagic into people\u2019s lives, but they are stuck with these superhero stick\nfigures playacting the clich\u00e9d 12 steps of the cinematic hero\u2019s journey.\n\nThat story exhausted its potential long ago. But they don\u2019t have another one.\n\nOne sign of this exhaustion is a contrivance known as the MacGuffin. The term\nwas invented by scriptwriter Angus MacPhail, best known for working with\ndirector Alfred Hitchcock. The MacGuffin is the object of the hero\u2019s quest in\na Hollywood movie, but MacPhail and Hitchcock realized\u2014with brilliant insight,\nI must add\u2014that any details about this central point of motivation in the\nstory are irrelevant.\n\nThe characters on the screen spend all their time worrying about this object,\nbut the audience really doesn\u2019t care. They enjoy the quest\u2014especially the\nfights and chases, trickery and double-dealing\u2014but it doesn\u2019t matter if it's a\nlost Ark of the Covenant or a Maltese Falcon or (in the spoof spy film What\u2019s\nUp, Tiger Lily?) the recipe for the best egg salad in the world.\n\nThe fun is in the pursuit, not its final object.\n\nBut consider the unsettling implication: Hollywood heroes are really chasing\nnothing. By the time we get to Pulp Fiction, the audience is invited to laugh\nat the emptiness of the concept.\n\nWhat was in the briefcase? Just a lightbulb and a battery\u2014but all the audience\ngets to see is the glow. If you want something more, something truly\nilluminating, you won\u2019t find it in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThe main thing I\u2019ve learned over the years,\u201d Hitchcock told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\nin a 1962 interview, \u201cis that the MacGuffin is nothing.\u201d He goes on:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m convinced of this, but I find it very difficult to prove it to others.\n> My best MacGuffin, and by that I mean the emptiest, the most nonexistent,\n> and the most absurd, is the one we used in North by Northwest. The picture\n> is about espionage, and the only question that\u2019s raised in the story is to\n> find out what the spies are after. . . . Oh, just government secrets!\u2019 is\n> the answer. Here, you see, the MacGuffin has been boiled down to its purest\n> expression: Nothing at all!\u201d\n\nIn seeking the origin of this approach, Hitchcock gave credit to Rudyard\nKipling, who used the device frequently in his stories. \u201cMany of them were spy\nstories, and were concerned with the efforts to steal the secret plans out of\na fortress. The theft of secret documents was the original MacGuffin.\u201d But\nHitchcock underestimates the lineage of this device. The MacGuffin actually\ndates back to the very beginnings of commercial publishing, if not earlier.\n\nUntil that moment, a MacGuffin is not only worthless, but actually harmful,\ndistracting potential heroes from their true path to mastery and\nenlightenment. But as soon as the hero\u2019s journey loses its real life\napplicability, and gets reconfigured as a charming story to pass an idle hour,\nall the arduous baggage of the real quest\u2014dreams, visions, fasts, rituals,\npractices of extraordinary discipline, esoteric wisdom, transcendental\nexperiences, and (especially important for us) magical songs\u2014are no longer\nrequired.\n\nIn their place, audiences get a MacGuffin. And as Hitchcock noted, it can be\nalmost nothing.\n\n> ### \u201cThis is the strangest moment in the history of our culture. The quest\n> was previously about transforming your life. Now it gets turned into a\n> physical object.\u201d\n\nSo we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to find the MacGuffin appearing at the dawn of\nthe publishing business. When William Caxton set up the first printing press\nin England, he wasn\u2019t seeking enlightenment, just profits. The old vision\nquest tradition linked to tales of King Arthur was unsuitable for that \u2014at\nleast in the form in which he inherited it\u2014but he cannily understood it could\nbe updated and modified in a way suitable for commerce.\n\nToday we would call it a brand franchise. Bill Caxton, in the year 1485 AD, is\nthe first person in the English-speaking world to grasp its money-making\npotential.\n\nBut the story had to be changed, and the object of the quest needed to be\ntransformed into a physical object, and one which (as Hitchcock would later\nproclaim) was so vaguely described that almost nothing specific could be said\nabout it.\n\nThis original MacGuffin was the Holy Grail. In fact, all MacGuffins are a kind\nof Holy Grail.\n\nIndiana Jones seeks the Holy Grail\u2014the prototype of all MacGuffins\n\nThis is the strangest moment in the history of our culture. The quest was\npreviously about transforming your life. Now it gets turned into a physical\nobject\u2014and a vague one, with all the key details missing.\n\nBut before talking about this extraordinary object and its mysterious history,\nwe need to acquaint ourselves with the Arthurian legend before it got turned\ninto a commercial book, Le Morte d'Arthur, by publisher and bookseller Caxton.\nThis will enable us to measure the huge gap between the traditional quest and\nthe hero\u2019s journey of the biggest brand franchises.\n\nAt the very start of the Arthurian tradition, we encounter the peculiar notion\nthat the singer is also a warrior hero. Scholars often admit puzzlement when\nconfronted by these connections\u2014for example when dealing with the surviving\nnarrative of Uther Pendragon from The Book of Taliesin, where the father of\nKing Arthur engages in a surprising monologue, conflating music and\nmanslaughter.\n\nHe starts by boasting about his valor in combat (\u201cIt is I who command in\nbattle; I will not halt the conflict till blood\u2019s been shed. . . . Arthur\nhimself has no more than a ninth of my valor\u201d), but soon switches to haughty\nclaims about his preeminence as a musician (\u201cI am a bard , and I\u2019m also a\nharpist, I play on the pipe and also the crwth [lyre]. As great as that of\nseven score poets.\u201d\n\nWhat a bizarre juxtaposition this is!\u2014at least for modern-day scholars. Some\nclaim that these are two different texts, squeezed together by mischance. They\ncan\u2019t comprehend a worldview in which songs and heroism are connected. But the\ncontinuity in meter, tone, and textual history refutes their skepticism. And\nthis musician is not only a hero in battle, but is actually the begetter and\nparent of King Arthur himself\u2014the key role model for today\u2019s film franchises.\n\nThe early bardic tradition is filled with these powerful musicians. Consider\nthe most famous of all traditional Welsh story compilations, the Mabinogion,\nwhere we learn of Br\u00e2n mounting an attack in a fierce war between the Welsh\nand Irish. We are told he \u201ctook all the string musicians on his back and made\nfor Ireland.\u201d\n\nWhy do you need an army of musicians to mount a war? It\u2019s ridiculous. . . .\nunless you live in a culture where musicians have special renown as\nparticipants or conductors or celebrants of heroic enterprises.\n\nThe most significant figure in this tradition is Taliesin, a bard who lived in\n6th century Wales and sang for at least three kings. The accumulated lore\nabout this individual makes him seem more like myth than reality. For here we\nencounter every element of the traditional quest hero.\n\nTaliesin, as he is described in various texts is shaman, soothsayer, warrior,\nmaster of codes and altered mind states, traveler to the Otherworld (the Welsh\nAnnwn), companion to King Arthur, and above all a singer who boasts of his\nsuperiority to all his peers. We are thousands of miles away from the Thracian\norigins of Orpheus, or the rituals of Native American dream seekers, or the\nshamanic communities of Siberia, yet here in Wales, the same playbook of the\nmusic-driven hero not only exists, but defines an entire cultural milieu.\n\nOf course, not everything we hear about Taliesin can be believed\u2014but the main\nreason for this is that so many later bards adopted his name for their own\nwork. This is always the pattern for the musical hero. The followers of\nOrpheus\u2014the original model for the musician hero in the West\u2014also pretended\nthat they were Orpheus. Ficino was doing this as late as the Renaissance.\n\nConsider the power of this technique. You could be Orpheus, the exemplary\nmusician who had mastered the byways of the Underworld. You could be Taliesin,\nthe shaman warrior who foretold the future. You are now more than just a\npassive member of the audience\u2014but are empowered to go on your own\ntransformative musical journey.\n\nWe find a similar imitation in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, where the\ndeceased is sometimes described as \u201cthe Osiris.\u201d In the best known version of\nthis text, now located at the British Museum, the lowly scribe Ani adopts the\npersona of this grand Egyptian deity and ruler of the Underworld. If any\nconfusion was involved, it was intentional\u2014you wanted those you encountered on\nyour journey to identify you with a formidable hero or deity.\n\nIn this way, even a scribe (or a Certified Public Accountant, perhaps) could\nget a taste of the glory previously only allowed to elite warriors and\npowerful leaders. Such texts tell us of an expansive and inclusive perspective\non heroism, markedly different from our stratified approach, one that sets the\nhero apart from the audience, who are merely invited to purchase a ticket and\napplaud at the end of the performance.\n\nThis is precisely the significance of the music-driven tradition of heroes\ncelebrated in this book. It\u2019s an approach to a hero\u2019s destiny that invites our\nemulation. We are expected to participate, provided we are willing to adopt\nthe discipline and sacrifices involved, but with rewards for those who\nsucceed\u2014albeit ones that are often intangible and metaphysical, yet no less\nvaluable for all of that.\n\n> ### \u201cCould this possibly be true? Is there a secret organization of magical\n> singers still operating in modern society, with roots going back to ancient\n> pagan rituals?\u201d\n\nAs late as the time of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes\u2014five hundred years after the\nhistorical Taliesin\u2014this kind of heroism still predominated in Western\nculture. Chr\u00e9tien did more than anyone to turn the Arthurian legend into a\nliterary phenomenon, leaving behind influential accounts of Lancelot,\nPercival, the Holy Grail, and other key elements that later storytellers would\nborrow and embellish. Some have even claimed that his work laid the foundation\nfor the later rise of the novel.\n\nBut Chr\u00e9tien himself was a singer\u2014he is the earliest known trouv\u00e8re, playing a\nkey role in bringing the song styles of the troubadours to the north of\nFrance. And his Arthurian tales are intensely rhythmic, with their rhyming\neight-syllable couplets. In later years, heroic narratives would abandon these\nmusical elements\u2014perhaps unwisely, in my opinion\u2014but at this stage (the\ntwelfth century) the bardic tradition still defined the storyteller\u2019s craft.\n\nScholar Jessie L. Weston, who perhaps did more than anyone to connect these\nArthurian stories of the hero\u2019s journey with actual rituals and initiations,\nhas argued that lurking behind the story of knights seeking the Holy Grail we\nfind \u201cabundant evidence that such a journey to the Worlds beyond was held to\nbe an actual possibility \u2014a venture to be undertaken by those who, greatly\ndaring, felt that the attainment of such knowledge of the Future Life was\nworth all the risks.\u201d\n\nWeston rightly points out that these accounts don\u2019t just show up in\nimaginative literature, but permeate religious and historical documents as\nwell. St. Paul initiated the tradition in Christianity by speaking of an\namazing journey to the Third Heaven\u2014noting that he met a person who had made\nthe trip. But he wasn\u2019t sure whether it happened in the traveler\u2019s physical\nbody or as an out-of-body experience.\n\nThis kind of ambiguity is an essential part of the tradition\u2014the real world\nand the alternative world are often contiguous or even overlap. So it\u2019s never\nquite clear when you have left one and arrived at the other. We have\nencountered that already in the Native American vision quest tradition, and\nit\u2019s also a key part of the Robert Johnson crossroads mythos where, as you\nrecall, he allegedly made the leap into an alternate reality at an actual\nintersection of roads you could find on a map.\n\nA whole history of these dreamlike encounters is beyond the scope of this\nbook, but once you are familiar with the broad outlines, you find them\neverywhere\u2014from the medieval poem Owain Miles to the dream-influenced\nEnlightenment philosophy of Emanuel Swedenborg and all the way to modern times\nand peculiar individuals such as Edgar Cayce and Robert Monroe.\n\nNeedless to say, musicologists pay no attention to these fringe figures\u2014so the\nrole of music in their stories is almost completely unexplored. Monroe\u2019s\nmemoirs, for example, may read like a Philip K. Dick sci-fi novel, but he\nfunded extensive (and impressive) research into the role of sound patterns in\nthese enhanced mental states, and his Hemi-Sync binaural beats technology is\nstill used for a wide range of purposes\u2014although I\u2019ve never met a music\nscholar who has paid any serious attention to the work of the Monroe\nInstitute.\n\nBut the most interesting passages from Jessie L. Weston\u2019s research into the\nhero\u2019s journey are those in which she tells readers what she has omitted from\nher work. The first bizarre passage shows up in the introduction to her book\nFrom Ritual to Romance. Here she claims that \u201cno inconsiderable part of the\ninformation at my disposal depended upon personal testimony, the testimony of\nthose who knew of the continued existence of such a ritual, and had been\nactually initiated into its mysteries.\u201d\n\nDid medievalist Jessie Weston belong to a secret society of musical quest\nheroes?\n\nBut then she refuses to share these firsthand accounts because scholars have\n\u201clittle respect\u201d for these living rituals and prefer footnotes or extracts\nfrom manuscripts and books. This is an extraordinary admission. Weston is not\nonly a 20th century figure, but is almost emblematic of the modernist\nmindset\u2014T.S. Elliot took the title and much of the imagery of The Waste Land\nfrom her research. But she apparently had connections to cults that undertook\nritualistic journeys to another world.\n\nWe would love to know details, but nothing more appears until we are well into\nher book, and she adds a strange comment on Sir Gawain and the Grail legend.\nHere she reveals, via a passing remark hidden in a footnote, that the ancient\ncults she connects to the narrative \u201care not a dead but a living tradition\n(how truly living, the exclusively literary critic has little idea).\u201d\n\nAgain she drops the subject, only to raise it one final time. Once more the\nrevelation is consigned to a footnote, this time near the very end of From\nRitual to Romance. Here Weston claims: \u201cWithout entering into indiscreet\ndetails I may say that students of the Mysteries are well aware of the\ncontinued survival of this ritual under circumstances which correspond exactly\nwith two of our Grail romances.\u201d\n\nShe never reveals sources or offers concrete details\u2014if she were an initiate\nthis may have been forbidden\u2014but her claims are nonetheless extraordinary. She\ntells us that the hero\u2019s journey to another world isn\u2019t a myth or legend, but\nan ongoing practice in the modern world.\n\nThat can\u2019t be true. Or can it?\n\nIs there a secret organization of magical singers still operating in modern\nsociety, with roots going back to ancient pagan rituals? Is it possible that\nanother pathway to heroism exists beyond sitting in a movie theater watching\nclich\u00e9d Hollywood films filled with MacGuffins?\n\nThat seems so unlikely, maybe even impossible. Yet I\u2019ve already shown how the\nmythos of blues musician Robert Johnson can only be understood in the context\nof the survival of this same tradition. And now we have evidence of another\nsurvival from across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nBut Jessie Weston would have no idea what would happen just one year after she\npublished her book....\n\nCOMING SOON: Part Two of \u201cWhat Is Really Inside the Briefcase in Pulp\nFiction?\u201d\n\nNotes:\n\nWelcome to the world of reality: David Foster Wallace, The Pale King (New\nYork: Little, Brown, 2011), pp. 229-230.\n\nThe main thing I\u2019ve learned over the years: This and below from Peter Wuss,\nCinematic Narration and its Psychological Impact: Functions of Cognition,\nEmotion and Play (Newcastle on Tyne, UK: Cambridge Scholars, 2009) p. 176.\n\nIt is I who command in battle: \u201cElegy for Uther Pendragon,\u201d from The Book of\nTaliesin, translated by Gwyneth Lewis and Rowan Williams (London: Penguin,\n2019), pp. 111-112.\n\ntook all the string musicians on his back: The Mabinogion translated by\nJeffrey Gantz (London: Penguin, 1976), p. 75.\n\nabundant evidence that such a journey to the Worlds beyond: Jessie L.
