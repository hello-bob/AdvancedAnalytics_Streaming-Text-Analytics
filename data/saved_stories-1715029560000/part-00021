I\u2019ve loved books since I was a kid, but I\ndidn\u2019t identify as a voracious reader until grad school. My writing professors\ntouted the importance of students reading thousands of books before taking a\nstab at penning their own. So, in an effort to maintain positive habits after\ngraduation, I decided to track my reading.\n\nI\u2019d jumped on the habit-tracking train before: daily words written, weekly\nmiles run. For a while, I even tracked the minutes I wasted on social media (I\ndon\u2019t recommend this\u2014it\u2019s too depressing). The outer accountability of habit\ntracking has helped me form healthier routines and utilize my time more\nwisely. I set my first annual reading goal at 40 books, finishing the final\npage of book number 40 before the ball dropped that New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nMoving into 2019, I resolved to raise my reading goal. I wanted to catch up\nwith my own compulsive bookstore purchases and watch that pile on my\nnightstand shrink even more rapidly. I was intrigued by the 52 books in 52\nweeks reading challenge I\u2019d seen on Nicole Zhu\u2019s blog. Surely I could handle\n12 more titles than I\u2019d read the year before. Plus, I liked the way it felt in\nprinciple: If I stayed on track, not only would I get a clean slate at the\nstart of the work week, I\u2019d get a second clean slate in cracking open a new\nbook.\n\nI started out strong, finishing four books in January, then five in February.\nTo track my progress, I used the Goodreads Reading Challenge, which informs\nyou when you\u2019re ahead of schedule, on track, or behind on your reading goal. I\nliked my new reading pace, making haste with books. Instead of lighting up my\nphone screen the moment I woke up in the morning, I\u2019d open a book instead,\nreading on the couch with my first cup of coffee. This habit has been a game-\nchanger. I\u2019ve never been able to read before bed because I fall asleep mid-\npage. But morning reading? I\u2019m all for it, and for the tone it sets for the\nrest of my day.\n\nAs the year progressed, I read several books I wasn\u2019t wild about. In the past,\nI\u2019ve always felt at peace with abandoning a book before finishing it. Why\nwaste time on a book I don\u2019t love, trudging through to reach an ending that\nwon\u2019t satisfy? But reading a book a week made it harder to justify\nabandonment. I didn\u2019t want to fall behind\u2014like I said, Goodreads will tell you\nwhen you do. And the thought of that sent my Type A brain into a tailspin. So\nI wound up finishing several books I felt lukewarm about from the very first\nchapters. I bolted through short story anthologies cover to cover, most of\nwhich I ordinarily would\u2019ve thumbed through, reading only the stories with\nopenings that piqued my interest. The pressure to finish books sucked some of\nthe day-to-day joy out of my reading life.\n\nI also never thought I\u2019d select a shorter book simply because it would take\nless time to read. But when I found myself stuck in a 700-page tome for three\nweeks, the next few books I picked off the nightstand pile had significantly\nfewer pages. I love big, sprawling novels and wish I\u2019d made time to read more\nof them in 2019. My favorite summer memories from past years involve dragging\na fat hardcover down to the beach, dozing off between chapters on my towel:\nbooks like Donna Tartt\u2019s The Goldfinch and Lauren Groff\u2019s Fates and Furies.\nAnd while I chose lighter books, I still barely took the time to watch the\nwaves striking the shore this summer. And more importantly, I wasn\u2019t immersed\nin reading. I was immersed in reaching a goal\u2014a goal that was beginning to\nfeel arbitrary.\n\nOn top of tracking my progress on Goodreads, I shared books on Instagram as I\nread. I was pleased when a follower told me I\u2019d inspired her to set a reading\nchallenge of her own. And when another friend said she\u2019d started reading a\nbook she saw I\u2019d just finished, I was thrilled. Sharing a reading experience\nwith someone is among the most intimate bonds.\n\nI received many messages from friends who were curious about what I thought of\na book I\u2019d just posted: Would I recommend it to them? Why or why not? But it\ntakes me a long time to digest a story. Often, I\u2019ll come away from a book with\nlukewarm feelings, only to love the story more after I\u2019ve lived with it at a\ndistance. On the flip side, I\u2019ve torn through certain books from beginning to\nend, adoring the story and its characters, only to notice it on my bookshelf\nmonths later and wonder what made it so captivating. Posting my progress as I\nfinished books allowed little space before friends started asking, \u201cWhat\u2019d you\nthink?\u201d While I loved that my friends wanted to chat about books, I often\ndidn\u2019t have the words to do so. I felt pressured to form opinions too soon. My\npost-reading experience became more forced than authentic.\n\nFinding myself in the middle of a book I never want to end is among the\ngreatest joys of reading. I live for the desire to finish a book in one\nsitting, and the competing desire to slow down and make the pleasure last.\nSadly, I robbed myself that pleasure this year. I blew through everything I\nread, including books I would\u2019ve dragged out for weeks just to live in their\nworlds a little longer.\n\nToday\u2019s habit-happy productivity culture advocates for setting measurable,\nattainable goals. Finishing what we start is considered a victory. But our\nreading lives shouldn\u2019t depend on filling in a Goodreads progress bar. That\u2019s\nbecause reading isn\u2019t just any old habit to track.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t change our society\u2019s obsession with productivity, I can change\nmy own. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve set a different reading goal for 2020. This year, it\nisn\u2019t based on the quantity of books I aim to finish. Instead, I resolve to\nabandon books I don\u2019t like. I\u2019ll take the whole summer to pore over that\nstaggering novel I never want to end. I\u2019ll recommend books to friends after\nI\u2019ve lived with the story awhile. I\u2019ll read intentionally and joyously. After\nall, there are too many good books out there. From now on, I\u2019ll take the time\nto savor them.\n\nImage credit: Tonny Tran\n\nTwitterShare\n\nThe Millions' future depends on your support.
