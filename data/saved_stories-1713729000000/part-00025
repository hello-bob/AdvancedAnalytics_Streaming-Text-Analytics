A retrospective of\nhis 25 years professional life, and how he could improve it, if he was set to\nstart it today. There are many similar articles out there, though the main\nappealing aspect of this one to me, is that I can relate to it quite easily.\nApart from the main goal of the article, I started to think about career\ngrowth in general. Given my current position at work, I find myself mentoring\nmy colleagues quite often. Career growth I assume is also quite a norm in\nprofessional world. Everyone wants to grow and attract a better position and\nsalary.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think \u201cwant\u201d always translates to \u201chappens\u201d. I\u2019m not even\nsure if \u201ceveryone\u201d knows what it takes to realize that goal. The social norm\nseems to be like, you enter your career, and the growth happens naturally if\nyou are part of the machine. And \u201cthe machine\u201d could be your company, your\nindustry, or the whole economy.\n\nBeing a good \u201cpart of the machine\u201d also varies per individuals, of course. It\ndepends on one\u2019s capacity of risk. Job hopping and resume hunting is one\napproach, and quite a trend these days. Some even recommend it (like Gergely\nOrosz in The Software Engineer\u2019s Guidebook). Of course, it might be a good\napproach.\n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering about is, if a \u201cbetter position\u201d or higher \u201csalary\u201d,\ntranslates to growth? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a shared experience among people active in\nmy industry (software in general), to see high ranking people, with close to\nno efficiency in their position. Winning the position, due to lack of\nknowledge of HR, or interest of a non-technical manager, or even pure luck.\n\nFor me, the growth boils down to how Naval describes himself in his famous\n2018 Twitter thread: How to Get Rich without getting lucky, and it\u2019s related\nPodcast episode. On the importance of knowledge, he says if one takes all his\nstatus, and his money today, and leaves him in an English-speaking country,\nwhere no one knows him. Armed with his knowledge, he can regain his money and\nposition, and this time he\u2019ll do it faster than the first time he did.\n\nThis is interesting, because with this mindset, growth is not translated into\na position, a salary, or a certificate. They\u2019ll come along eventually, but\nthey are not the main goal, it\u2019s the knowledge and taking action based on that\nwhich matters. That helps me to map out where I can find the growth, and who\nto expect it from. It\u2019s me, who should provide myself with answers to \u201cwhy?,\nwhere? And how?\u201d.\n\nMost sources, like the book from Gergely, and the essay from Nicola, try to\ncommunicate the same message. However, for some reason, we (as community),\nmiss the point. During my career, I\u2019ve met a lot of people, who don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s their next step (I get it, it\u2019s hard, and I\u2019ve been there too). Or\nexpect their company, help them to grow, without them having any focused and\nSMART goal of their own (I\u2019ve been there too).\n\nThe crack between, who we are today, and where we want to find ourselves in is\ncaused by this lack of clear target. If the crack is too big, it means we need\nto take charge, and draw our own path of growth. Hoping for others to help us\nto get there, is why we\u2019ve ended up here.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
