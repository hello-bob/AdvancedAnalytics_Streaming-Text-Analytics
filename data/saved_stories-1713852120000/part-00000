You\u2019ll find the technology in\nearbud cases, cell phones, and even your bedside table. The benefit of\nwireless power is obvious: The convenience of freeing ourselves from all those\npesky cords and various connector types. But that might be the only benefit.\n\nWhat about the tradeoffs? Is there any truth to claims that wireless charging\noverheats your phone, or damages your battery? How efficient is wireless\ncharging when compared to wired charging? And are all wireless chargers made\nequal?\n\n## The Basics\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning. How does wireless charging work? Whether we\u2019re\ntalking about the charging pads many of us have on our bedside tables or the\nlatest phones that incorporate \u201creverse charging\u201d, the fundamentals are the\nsame.\n\nAs with wired connections, a wireless charger needs to transfer energy to your\nphone\u2019s battery. That\u2019s easy enough with a cable connection, but what happens\nwhen your charger is separated from the phone by plastic, glass, and a layer\nof highly reluctant air? Reluctance is an engineering term by the way, I\u2019m not\nsuggesting air is lazy.\n\nThe trick is to manipulate the electrons in the wireless charger\u2019s coil (what\nwe\u2019ll call the transmitting coil) by pushing them in one direction and then\nthe other to create an alternating current (AC). The AC current inside the\ntransmitting coil then creates an alternating magnetic field (check out\nFaraday\u2019s Law of Electromagnetic Induction to understand why this happens).\n\nThe interior of a MagSafe wireless charger. The alternating current along the\ncopper coil creates a magnetic field.\n\nEach back and forth of the current is measured in hertz (Hz) and wireless\ncharging coils generally operate in the 130-140 kilohertz (kHz) range. That\nmeans the current moves back and forth in the coil around 140,000 times per\nsecond.\n\nThere\u2019s a corresponding coil on our target device (which we\u2019ll call the\nreceiving coil). When placed close to the transmitting coil, the alternating\nmagnetic field induces an alternating current in the receiving coil. This AC\ncurrent is then converted to direct current (DC) using a full bridge rectifier\nand some other circuitry. And hey presto, we have power!\n\nWhat about wired connections? That\u2019s much simpler. The AC current from the\nwall socket is converted to DC by your power brick and flows through the\ncopper wire straight into your phone. Your phone then decides how quickly it\nwants to draw that current based on the safe limits set by the manufacturer.\n\n## Wired Charging Efficiency\n\nDue to the cruel realities of our physical realm, all energy transfer will\nsuffer some loss. Various factors play a part in the efficiency loss\nincluding:\n\n  * Switching and transformer losses in the power brick circuitry\n  * Resistive heating (aka Joule heating)\n  * Energy draw by internal components in charging bricks, IC\u2019s in cables, and the phone\u2019s own internal components\n\nSo if we take a wired charging setup as an example, the power brick will\nconvert the AC from the mains into DC for our device. The AC to DC conversion\nlosses generate heat, which is bad news for electronics. Heat is such an issue\nthat engineers spend lots of time trying to minimize it. In fact, as our\nelectronics get warmer, the internal resistance of the copper wires and traces\nalso increase. So not only is the heat considered wasted energy, it also\nactively makes the process of transferring electrons less efficient (thereby\ngenerating even more heat!).\n\nModern GaN chargers utilize gallium nitride semiconductors which have a higher\nelectron mobility, larger band gap, and better thermal conductivity. All this\nmeans a GaN charger will heat up less and dissipate heat faster. It\u2019s cooler\nthan silicon-based chargers (literally and figuratively!).\n\nLet\u2019s break this down into a few easily digestible stages.\n\nStage 1\n\nOur charging brick takes the AC current from the mains and converts it to DC,\nby far the most common input for our home electronics. We\u2019ll lose some energy\nin the form of dissipated heat as the electrons make their way across the\ncircuits. We\u2019ll also lose some energy to the IC\u2019s and other components that\ndraw energy to enable the charger to function.\n\nStage 2\n\nThe DC current from the GaN charger flows through the copper wire in the\ncharging cable to our device. Electrons don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license or if\nthey do, they were issued in California. This means they won\u2019t necessarily\nmove in a straight line. They\u2019ll collide with other particles, the edges of\nthe copper surface, and any impurities that may be present in the copper\ncable. Each time an electron bounces off something, it loses energy and\ngenerates more heat. But as far as our tests are concerned, the amount of\nenergy lost in this way is relatively small.\n\nStage 3\n\nThe electrons reach another set of IC\u2019s on the other end of our USB-C cable as\nthey enter the cell phone. These IC\u2019s will draw some energy to function, while\ndiverting the correct amount of current to the battery.\n\nStage 4\n\nThe stream of electrons finally arrives at the battery. As ions are exchanged\nand the chemical reactions take place inside the battery, we see the greatest\nloss of energy throughout the entire process thus far. Heat is generated as\nmore collisions take place and chemical reactions between the anode and\ncathode of the battery gradually increase the potential difference between the\ntwo poles. The more current we push into the battery, the more energy we lose\nas heat.\n\nStage 5\n\nIt\u2019s very rare that we unplug our phones the very moment the battery hits 100%\ncharge. It\u2019s ok if you sit over your phone till it ticks over to that last\npercent, we\u2019re not judging, but most of us charge our phones overnight while\nwe sleep. This means your phone will continue to draw power after it charges\nto 100%.\n\nThankfully, modern chargers are smart enough to shut off completely once you\nunplug your device so the charging brick won\u2019t continue to draw power from the\nmains when not in use.\n\nIn a polymer encased nutshell, this is how most people charge a cell phone\nbattery.\n\n## Wireless Charging Efficiency\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the process of wireless charging. It has all the same\ninefficiencies of wired charging, there\u2019s a power brick and some copper\nwiring, but it also introduces an additional loss through the wireless\ncharging coils. Again, let\u2019s break this down into stages.\n\nStage 1\n\nOur charging brick takes the AC current in the wall and converts it to DC,\njust like in our wired example. No changes there.\n\nStage 2\n\nThe DC current then flows through the copper cable to the wireless charging\npad suffering all the same energy losses as our wired example.\n\nStage 3\n\nAfter powering some IC\u2019s, our excitable electrons arrive at the transmitting\ncoil in the wireless charging puck. Unlike our wired example, our wireless\ncharging coil needs AC current to create a magnetic field that can transfer\nenergy. So we\u2019ve converted AC from the mains to DC in our GaN charger, and now\nback to AC to power the transmitting coil. That\u2019s a fair amount of energy\nwe\u2019ve just lost throughout that process.\n\nStage 4\n\nOnce the coil has its AC supply, that current moves back and forth at around\n140,000 cycles per second. Operating at such high frequencies introduces\nadditional losses caused by the Skin Effect. When a current alternates in a\nconductor at high frequency, the electrons vacate the center of the conductor\n(the copper wire) and only utilize the outer surface. This effectively reduces\nthe conductor\u2019s surface area, packing the electrons ever closer and increasing\nthe number of collisions which occur. More collisions means more energy wasted\nas heat.\n\nStage 5\n\nThe energy transferred to the receiving coil will also oscillate at a high\nfrequency meaning that the Skin Effect will apply here too. It also means that\nthe receiving coil is generating an AC current and before charging can begin,\nthat current needs to be converted to DC. That means that from the wall to the\nbattery, we\u2019ve converted:\n\n  1. AC to DC\n  2. DC to AC\n  3. AC to magnetic flux\n  4. Magnetic flux to AC\n  5. And finally AC back to DC.\n\nEach conversion represents further energy loss.\n\nStage 6\n\nThe stream of electrons arrive at the battery and the charging process begins,\njust like in our wired example.\n\nStage 7\n\nUnlike our wired example, wireless charging pads will continue to draw energy\nafter you remove your phone. Typically around 0.2W but that figure fluctuates\ndepending on the charger.\n\nAdditional Loss of Energy\n\nMost wireless chargers are round pucks that allow you to place your peripheral\nanywhere on the pad. That means there\u2019s a high chance that you\u2019re not\nperfectly aligning the receiving coil with the transmitting coil, reducing the\noverall efficiency of the energy transfer between coils. The Qi2 standard\naddresses this with a circular magnetic ring around each coil (think MagSafe\ndesign) which takes care of this problem. All other chargers, or smaller\ndevices like AirPods, will suck up more power purely because the coils can\u2019t\nachieve optimal alignment.\n\nA standard first generation wireless charger without magnets.The dark outer\nring is comprised of multiple rare earth magnets.\n\nThe distance between the transmitting coil and receiving coil also impacts how\nefficient the charging experience will be. The further apart the coils are,\nthe more energy is needed to charge the device. So if you have a case on your\nphone, the extra millimeter or three will result in a decrease in efficiency.\n\nLastly, unlike modern power bricks that shut off when not in use, a wireless\ncharger has to \u201cprobe\u201d constantly for the presence of a wirelessly chargeable\ndevice. This constant probing consumes energy, and how much depends on the\ncharging pad in question. Of the ones we tested, we saw a continuous average\npower draw of around 0.2W (excluding our worst performer, more on that later).\nThe average user will leave their wireless charger plugged into mains in a\nfixed position, say on the bedside table or on a desk, which means the charger\nwill draw power throughout the day as the wireless pad continuously pings for\na device.\n\nSo the theory is clear. Wireless charging should definitely be less efficient\nthan wired charging. But by how much? And are batteries being damaged in the\nprocess?\n\nLet\u2019s get to testing and find out.\n\n## The Baseline\n\nAs avid fans of the scientific method, we\u2019re going to do our best to account\nfor as many factors as we can reasonably control. That means using the same\ncables, charging bricks, phones, and measuring equipment throughout each test.\nHaving said that, there\u2019s always going to be a margin of error that we won\u2019t\nbe able to account for (such as ambient room temperature differences\nthroughout the day).\n\nIn order for these test results to have any meaning, we\u2019ll compare wireless\ncharging to a stable and proven alternative: A wired charge of an iPhone 15\nPro using iFixit\u2019s 65W GaN charger and iFixit\u2019s 240W rated USB-C to USB-C\ncable. We\u2019ve already tested our charger and cable against a 70W Apple GaN\ncharger and found them to operate at roughly the same efficiency (ours was\nactually slightly more efficient but who\u2019s keeping score?).\n\nWe\u2019re keen to get accurate temperature measurements from the battery itself\nand not just the surface of the phone. Our resident engineer, Arthur Shi, set\nus up with a handy dandy temperature probe that slides through one of the P2\nscrew holes at the bottom of our iPhone 15 Pro and gets taped snugly against\nthe lithium polymer battery pack. We can even close the device back up to get\nreadings that are as close to real world usage as possible.\n\nFor power draw, we\u2019re using a watt meter at the mains, to which our iFixit GaN\ncharger is plugged into, and a second watt meter between the GaN charger and\nthe iPhone 15 Pro (either as a cable direct to the phone or a cable to the\ncharging puck).\n\nLast but not least, we\u2019re monitoring and recording temperature and power draw\nat five minute intervals and recording the results.\n\nSo without further ado, here\u2019s the data from the wired test which will\ncomprise our baseline for everything else.\n\nThe graph shows that over two hours and 10 minutes, the phone charged from 0%\nto 100% and had a peak power draw of 20W at the 30% charge mark. The battery\ntemperature also peaks shortly after at 30\u00b0C and begins to decline back down\nas the battery cell fills and the power draw from the mains also declines. The\ntotal energy used to fully charge a 12.7Wh battery was 18.25Wh, which means\nthere was a 5.55Wh or 35.9% loss of energy. That\u2019s a lot of waste, and it\u2019s\nalso our best case scenario.\n\nWhile this data is informative, it cannot be taken as an absolute measure of\ncharging efficiency. Most people charge their phones overnight, which means\nthe phone remains plugged in long after it fully charges.\n\nAssuming a 7 hour sleep cycle for the average wage slave, the phone will\ncontinue to draw around 1.1W from the mains for another four hours and fifty\nminutes before it\u2019s unplugged. The good news is that modern charging bricks\nare smart enough to shut down completely if there is no draw, so once the\nphone is unplugged there is nothing being drawn from the mains.\n\nSo over a 24-hour period, an iPhone 15 Pro will draw something in the region\nof 23.6Wh when charged with a USB-C cable. Since wired charging is the most\nefficient means of charging available to us, we\u2019re not going to include any\nenergy used to get the battery to 100% in our calculations for avoidable\nwaste. Anything after 100% charge, that is to say any value above our baseline\nof 18.25Wh per day, will be included as waste.\n\nAssuming we\u2019re charging the phone from empty to 100% without adaptive charging\nand at the fastest speeds available to the phone (i.e. worst case scenario),\nthe potential maximum waste for a wired charge over a day, would be 5.3Wh x\n365 which comes to 1.94kWh over a year. That\u2019s the equivalent of leaving a 10W\nLED lamp on for eight days straight.\n\n## Candidate One: Apple\u2019s 15W MagSafe Wireless Charger\n\nApple\u2019s MagSafe wireless charging pad is our first test case because I suspect\nit\u2019s going to do pretty well compared to the other wireless chargers we\u2019re\nlooking at. It has a USB-C connector and has magnets integrated around the\ncoil which allows it to latch on to an iPhone 12 or newer device. Apple\nactually contributed to the Qi2 standard and any newer Qi2 compliant device\nwith the MagSafe style magnets would be compatible with this charger.\n\nIt also charges at 15W, so long as you\u2019re using a 20W or higher charging\nbrick. Let\u2019s see how it compares to a wired charge.\n\nAs expected, Apple\u2019s MagSafe charger did relatively well in the 0-100% charge\nscenario but as the graph shows, there were some key differences when compared\nto our baseline wired test. First off, we can see the power draw ramps up\nfaster and earlier in the charge process but also ramps down a little quicker\nlater on. This results in a total energy use of 23.33Wh. That\u2019s a 24.4%\nincrease in energy consumption when compared to our wired test and represents\na 59% loss of energy to charge a 12.7Wh battery.\n\nIn addition to the extra 5.08Wh required to get to a full charge, taking our 7\nhour sleep cycle scenario means the wireless charger continues to draw 1.5W\nfrom mains for another 4 hours and 55 minutes which uses another 7.4Wh. We\u2019re\nnow at 30.73Wh, and we\u2019re not done yet.\n\nOnce you remove your phone from the wireless charging station, the station\ncontinues to draw power to \u201cprobe\u201d for the presence of a device on the pad\nthat may need to be charged. These probe signals are sent out often enough\nthat we see energy fluctuations from the mains that average to around 0.2W,\neven though we\u2019re not charging anything. So over the 17 hours that our phone\nisn\u2019t being charged, the device itself draws 3.4Wh. This gives us a total draw\nof 34.13Wh per day, or 12.36kWh per year. That\u2019s 36.48% more energy used when\ncompared to a wired charge.\n\nSince we\u2019re using 15.88Wh of energy above our baseline of 18.25Wh, this means\nthat a potential 5.8kWh a year is being wasted. Remember that 10W LED light?\nYou\u2019re now leaving it on for 24 days straight!\n\nAnd that\u2019s still not the whole story. The higher power draw results in higher\nbattery temperatures, nearly reaching 40\u00b0C in our tests, while the battery\ntemperature climb down is also extended. We\u2019ll revisit the battery temperature\nproblem later. For now, note that the battery is getting hotter.\n\nFor those of you that are curious, you can take a look at the innards of a\nMagSafe wireless puck in our iPhone 12 teardown analysis.\n\n## Candidate Two: Amazon Basics 15W Wireless Charger\n\nI don\u2019t know who\u2019s design Amazon ripped off or who\u2019s business they drove into\nthe ground to make this, but it is a cheap and cheerful 15W USB-C charger that\nis Qi certified. That means the transmitting coil doesn\u2019t have the alignment\nmagnets of Qi2 certified devices that lock the transmitting and receiving\ncoils in the most optimal positions.\n\nThis is our worst case scenario test. How inefficient can wireless charging be\nwhen the coils are misaligned?\n\nThe answer is: Very inefficient. It took nearly four hours to charge the\niPhone 15 Pro when it was placed off center and the battery temperatures\nremained above 40C for most of the charge cycle, which is bad news for battery\nlongevity.\n\nWe ran this same test with an iPhone 15 Pro fitted with a non-MagSafe\ncompatible case, but the results were surprisingly similar.\n\nDrawing a hefty 33.93Wh for a 0-100% charge, another 14Wh for the three hours\nthe phone would remain on the charging puck to complete our 7 hour sleep\ncycle, and 10Wh in standby mode while the charger is unused, the Amazon Basics\ncharger consumes 57.93Wh per day and 21.15kWh per year.\n\nUsing our 18.25Wh baseline, that\u2019s 104.2% more energy used to charge the\ndevice. That translates to 14.48kWh per year being wasted. We\u2019re now leaving\nour 10W LED bulb on for more than 60 days straight. By this point every dad in\nthe country would have turned the thermostat down to 62F.\n\n## Bonus Candidate: Tesla\u2019s Wireless Charging Platform\n\nThere\u2019s not much information on the Tesla Wireless Charging Platform though\nwe\u2019re told it\u2019s compatible with Qi certified devices. We\u2019re also told that\n\u201ccharging performance may vary\u201d. Very cryptic. Let\u2019s see if this charging pad\nsticks the landing like a Falcon 9 or if it\u2019s going to crash and burn like\nStarship.\n\nI\u2019ve not even started the test and the end result is already a foregone\nconclusion. At idle and without any device attached, the Tesla charger draws a\nconstant 1.4W from mains! Compare that to the 0.2W drawn by the Apple MagSafe\ncharger.\n\nPlacing a phone on the charge pad doesn\u2019t improve the situation. As we\u2019ve\nalready seen in teardowns of the device, the Tesla charger relies on multiple\ntransmitting coils that overlap each other.\n\nThis means that regardless of where you place your device, several coils will\nalways be misaligned with the receiving coil. This is an incredibly\ninefficient design and the test results show this.\n\nTesla\u2019s wireless charger performs nearly as well as a poorly positioned phone\non a non-MagSafe charger. The disparity in efficiency is even more glaring\nwhen compared to a properly aligned transmitting and receiving coil.\n\nThere is no best case scenario for the Tesla Charging Platform. It\u2019s the\nabsolute worst case scenario for wireless charging wasting 66.3Wh a day which\nis a whopping 113.7% more than a wired charge would consume.\n\nThe 17.54kWh wasted every year is the equivalent of leaving a 10W LED light on\nfor 73 days straight. At this point there\u2019s no point turning the thermostat\ndown any further because Santa\u2019s definitely bringing you coal for Christmas.\nWhich is great because you can finally turn that light off and warm yourself\nup.\n\nPretty poor showing from Tesla. I\u2019m not sure how Elon plans to save the planet\nwith this kind of wasteful energy consumption.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile not performed under strict laboratory conditions, the data we\u2019ve\ngathered still provides us with a very good idea of what works and what\ndoesn\u2019t. Wired charging is the most efficient way to charge anything and that\nis an indisputable fact. We can also show that though wireless charging is\ninefficient, there are grades of inefficiency among wireless chargers too. Qi2\nand MagSafe chargers clearly offer the best efficiency while the first\ngeneration Qi chargers and poorly designed products can consume more than\ntwice as much power as a wired charging setup.\n\nTesla\u2019s Wireless Charging Platform deserves special mention for their dumpster\nfire of a design. This charger has the singular honor of being ludicrously\npower hungry when not being used and absurdly inefficient no matter how you\nplace your phone on the stand.\n\nOur tests also suggest that your battery may be better off kicking the\nwireless habit.\n\nWhile the back glass of the iPhone was warm to the touch during our charging\ntests, the battery didn\u2019t exceed 30\u00b0C on a wired charge or 45\u00b0C (which is a\nwarm day in Texas!) in the worst wireless scenario. Most of the waste heat is\nlikely dissipated through the phone frame. This is a good thing, because\naccording to Battery University, temperatures above 30\u00b0C are considered\n\u201celevated temperatures\u201d, causing the battery to degrade if the temperature is\nmaintained over a long period of time. Go over 60\u00b0C, and lithium-ion batteries\nbegin to break down rapidly and irreversibly.\n\nThankfully, none of the charging temperatures get anywhere near 60\u00b0C. The\ncharger and phone have temperature sensors and we did see indications that\nsome throttling was occurring to avoid excessively high temperatures.\n\nWIth that said, our wired charge was the only test scenario where the battery\nmomentarily touched 30\u00b0C while all our wireless charging test scenarios saw\nthe battery warming well above 30\u00b0C. You can expect to see reduced battery\nlongevity in the case of the Tesla charger or any situation where the charging\ncoils are improperly aligned.\n\nThe tl;dr: is that wired charging is by far the most efficient way to charge\nany device.\n\nFinally, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the Tesla charger is by\nfar one of the most inefficient designs I\u2019ve seen. Not only is it poorly\ndesigned, maximizing waste for the sake of extending wireless reach across a\nsurface, it\u2019s also so inefficient in transferring energy that the prolonged\nexcess heat generated by the charging battery will degrade the operating life\nof the battery cells.\n\nIf you do go wireless, choose wisely. Qi2 and MagSafe certified devices would\nbe your best bet in terms of efficiency. Combine that with an energy saving\npower strip and you\u2019ll limit the energy lost while the charger is not in use.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nTeardowns\n\n### iPhone 12 and 12 Pro Teardown\n\nTech News\n\n### Wireless Charging Is a Disaster Waiting to Happen \u2013 OneZero\n\nTech News\n\n### AirPods With Wireless Charging Are Here and Likely Still Disposable\n\n### 10 Comments\n\nThis kind of testing is great and I really appreciate the time you've put into\nit. But I think it's important to keep some things in mind. 1. Wireless\ncharging is very inefficient but the total energy loss from charging phones is\nvery small compared to other uses. 2. Wireless charging helps protect ports\nfrom needing repair. I want to use my phone for ~7 years, and wired charging\nwould see the usb-c port become loose within a couple of years. Wireless\ncharging mitigates this. (We also just need more resilient ports) 3. This\ntesting also shows how little control consumers have over their devices. Being\nable to limit charging based on percentage, battery temperature, etc. would\nreally help people extend the life of their battery and mitigate the heat\nissues in wireless charging.\n\nNick Onorato - 4 days agoApr 18, 2024 Reply\n\nWhat's the specs and accuracy of the charge counter?

Often, users will just\nnot plug in, even if there are charge cords available; and absolutely more\nrarely will dig a charging cable out if there are only charging ports\navailable. But if there is a special spot they can just lay their phone on to\ngrab a few percent, they don\u2019t even need to plug or unplug anything, they\u2019ll\ndo it!\n\nAll that is to say: opportunistic charging likely helps keep people above that\ndreaded 20% threshold. (Empirically easily above 30%.) I\u2019d find it interesting\nto see how wireless charging fares if the assumption is that the user may use\nit MORE often, and is keeping their phones in the preferred 25%\u201385% range.\nThat would seem to remove the strong energy draw/heat seen when the battery is\ndown in the 0\u201320% basement.\n\nScott - 2 days agoApr 20, 2024 Reply\n\nFound this article very interesting and informative!\n\nWhile most of us figure that little light on our powerstrip is no big deal,\nmultiply them by the ten that we leave plugged in all the time, then the\nBillion other people doing it, before you know it, it\u2019s a shitload\n(technically speaking) of wasted money and energy! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\udf0e\n\nShane Young - 2 days agoApr 20, 2024 Reply\n\niFixit\n\n  * About Us\n  * Customer Support\n  * Discuss iFixit\n  * Careers\n  * Newsletter\n  * API\n\nResources\n\n  * Press\n  * News\n  * Participate\n  * Pro Wholesale\n  * Retail Locator\n  * For Manufacturers\n\nLegal\n\n  * Accessibility\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n\nStay in the loop\n\nLearn something new every month!\n\nLet me read it first!\n\nHelp translate\n\nRepair is noble\n\n\u00a9 iFixit\n\n\u2014\n\nLicensed under Creative Commons\n\n", "frontpage": false}
