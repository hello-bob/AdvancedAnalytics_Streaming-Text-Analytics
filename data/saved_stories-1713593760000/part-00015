It\nlooks and tastes the same as normal pasta.\n\nBut the origins of the proteins which give it its full-bodied flavour are\nextraordinary: they come from Europe\u2019s first factory dedicated to making human\nfood from electricity and air.\n\nThe factory\u2019s owner, Solar Foods, has started production at a site in Vantaa,\nnear the Finnish capital of Helsinki, that will be able to produce 160 tonnes\nof food a year. It follows several years of experimenting at lab scale.\n\nSolar Foods has already gained novel food approval for solein in Singapore,\nand is seeking to introduce its products in the US this autumn, followed by\nthe EU by the end of 2025 \u2013 and the UK too, if the regulator can get through\nthe deluge of cannabis-related products.\n\nThe factory\u2019s output may be small in terms of the global food industry, but\nPasi Vainikka, the Solar Foods co-founder and chief executive, hopes that\nproving its technology works will be a crucial step in revolutionising what\nhumans eat.\n\nPasi Vainikka, the Solar Foods co-founder, hopes it will help revolutionise\nwhat humans eat. Photograph: Jussi Eskola/The Guardian\n\nFood and agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of all planet-heating\ncarbon emissions. Its share of pollution is likely to grow as other industries\nshift to using green electricity, and ever-expanding middle-classes demand\nmore meat for their tables. Up to now the focus for some climate campaigners\nhas been to try to persuade people to eat less meat and more plants. Non-\nfarmed proteins such as solein might make that approach more appealing.\n\nSolein comes in the form of a yellowish powder made up of single-cell\norganisms, similar to yeast used in baking or beer-making. The company is\nhoping for those proteins to be used in meat alternatives, cheese and\nmilkshakes, and as an egg replacement ingredient in noodles, pasta and\nmayonnaise.\n\nThe ravioli it served up this week was made with solein replacing egg, with a\nsolein version of cream cheese. The Finnish confectioner Fazer has already\nsold chocolate bars in Singapore with added solein (which is also a handy\nsource of iron for vegans). A Singaporean restaurant last year created a\nsolein chocolate gelato, replacing dairy milk.\n\nVainikka was researching renewable energy systems at a Finnish research\ninstitute in 2014 when he met his co-founder, Juha-Pekka Pitk\u00e4nen, a\nbioprocesses scientist. Pitk\u00e4nen told him of soil-dwelling microbes that\nrelease the energy they need to live from oxidising hydrogen (rather than the\nglucose used by humans, for instance).\n\nTogether they built a 200-litre fermenter in a garage near Helsinki, to prove\nthe technology could be used for food, but then went into the wild \u201cfinding\nnew potatoes to grow\u201d. All Vainikka will say on solein\u2019s origins is that they\nfound it somewhere \u201cclose to shore\u201d in the Baltic Sea.\n\nSolar Foods\u2019 factory in Vantaa, near the Finnish capital of Helsinki, has just\nstarted production. Photograph: Jussi Eskola/The Guardian\n\nAlmost all food consumed by humans at the moment ultimately comes from plants,\nwhich use energy from the sun for photosynthesis. That process converts carbon\ndioxide and water into the molecules they need to grow. Solar Foods instead\nuses the same renewable electricity from the sun to split water apart. It then\nfeeds the hydrogen and oxygen to the microbes in a brewing vessel, plus carbon\ndioxide captured from the air from the company\u2019s office ventilation system.\n\nThe claim that the proteins are made out of thin air is \u201cnever more than 95%\ntrue\u201d, says Vainnika: 5% of the mixture in the brewing vessel is a solution\ncontaining other minerals needed by cells, such as iron, magnesium, calcium\nand phosphorus. The microbes are then pasteurised (killing them), then dried\nin a centrifuge and with hot air. That leaves a powder that can be used in\nfood.\n\nThe process could also use CO_2 from, for instance, burning fuels \u2013 although\nthe molecule would end up back in the atmosphere once humans eat the solein\nand breathe out the carbon again. The real climate benefits from solein come\nfrom cutting the vast tracts of land used \u2013 and abused through deforestation\non an epic scale \u2013 for animal feed and pasture. Instead, renewed forests could\ntrap carbon.\n\nEfficient US farmers get 3.3 tonnes of soya beans from each harvest of a\nhectare, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization. By contrast,\nSolar Foods\u2019 pilot factory takes up a fifth of a hectare to produce 160 tonnes\na year.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Dozens are using microbes to\ncreate animal feed, although they often require sugars or fossil fuel\nfeedstocks. One US rival, Air Protein, has opened a factory in California\nusing similar \u201chydrogenotrophs\u201d \u2013 hydrogen eaters. It has the backing of the\nfood multinational Archer-Daniels-Midland, the British bank Barclays and GV\n(formerly Google Ventures).\n\nThe Dutch company Deep Branch, which is making fish food, claims its Proton\nprotein will be 60% less carbon-intensive than conventional proteins. Deep\nBranch is looking at taking the CO_2 produced by the UK biomass power\ngenerator Drax.\n\nThe companies have produced their test products. Now they face the challenge\nof proving their technology works at scale.\n\nVainikka says that is the key problem for cultured meat, or lab-grown meat.\nThe market value of newly listed companies such as Beyond Meat soared during\nthe coronavirus pandemic bubble, only to come crashing down as sales slumped.\nThe opening of Solar Foods\u2019 first factory will be crucial in persuading\ninvestors that the company will not suffer the same fate.\n\nWith meat protein, which is much more expensive than plants or cellular\nagriculture, there is simply no competition on price for each kilo. But Solar\nFoods and rivals could face other problems. Conservative politicians\nparticularly in the US and Italy have identified lab-grown food as a threat to\ntheir ranching and farming cultures.\n\nVainikka argues that these fears are misplaced. He wants \u201ccoexistence of new\nand old\u201d, with artisanal, high-quality farms remaining alongside cell farming\nthat can deliver cheap, bulk foods. He argues it is \u201cthe opportunity of the\ncentury for the meat industry\u201d to focus on quality rather than churning out as\nmuch cheap (and heavily subsidised) meat as possible. And plant agriculture\nwill also remain, he argues.\n\n\u201cThe future is not powder: the main body of food will still come through\nplants,\u201d he says. The occasional \u201csalami with the cultural heritage, that can\nremain. The meat in your lasagne during lunch will be done by cellular\nagriculture.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Food & drink industry\n  * Food\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
