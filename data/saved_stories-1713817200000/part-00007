But that's totally\nnot the case here - it just means that you're deep into a third or fourth\ndetailed chapter before you even know it!\n\nI may know Desiree through the Tableau community but her additional knowledge\nof D3 and code comes through, to the point where the book is tool-agnostic.\nIt's not a tech guide, but I guarantee if you're a new starter or intermediate\nin the field, you'll learn key points.\n\nFavourite quote (relevant to my own work!) \"Even Alice, on her journey to\nWonderland, was given the instructions to \u201cEat me\u201d on the magic cake and\n\u201cDrink me\u201d on the magic bottle.\" Key advice on labelling, annotations,\nreadability!\n\nBook will be out soon, on my shelf soon after.\u201d\n\nVerified Buyer\n\n\u201cGreat value\u201d\n\nVery good approach\n\nApril 6, 2023 by Anonymous (DE)\n\n\u201cI like the way of getting into the topic.
