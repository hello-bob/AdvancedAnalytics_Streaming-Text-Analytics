When you\u2019re collecting that\nmuch sensitive private data, you become a target.\n\nAs the article linked above notes:\n\n> It is a legal requirement in NSW for licensed clubs to collect personal\n> information from patrons on entry, under the state\u2019s registered clubs\n> legislation.\n>\n> The information is required to be stored securely under federal privacy\n> laws.\n\nSounds kinda like the age verification requirements for websites. You have to\ncollect the info and then pinky promise to keep it secure. And it works until\nthis happens:\n\n> An unauthorised website claims personal information of more than 1 million\n> customer records from at least 16 licensed NSW clubs have been released\n> online in a potential data breach.\n>\n> Cybercrime detectives are investigating the reported breach with the website\n> claiming to have records and personal information of senior government\n> figures, including Premier Chris Minns, Deputy Premier Prue Car and Police\n> Minister Yasmin Catley.\n>\n> IT provider Outabox said in a statement it had become aware of the potential\n> data breach of a sign-in system used by its clients by an \u201cunauthorised\u201d\n> third party.\n\nHilariously, government officials are trying to play this down because it was\njust a breach rather than a hack. As if that makes a difference?\n\n> Gaming Minister David Harris said the government and police first became\n> aware of the potential breach on Tuesday.\n>\n> \u201cWe know that this is an alleged data breach of a third-party vendor, so it\n> wasn\u2019t a hack,\u201d he said.\n\nBut this is exactly the concern regarding online age verification. Someone has\nto collect that information and then whoever is collecting the sensitive info\nbecomes an immediate target, no matter how the data is accessed.\n\nIncredibly, you might recall that just a few months ago we were giving the\nAustralian government kudos for recognizing that age verification was a\nprivacy and security nightmare. So, they knew that just last summer.\n\nAnd yet, here we are with the latest announcement:\n\n> Despite those concerns from late last year, the government is now pushing\n> ahead with a pilot to try and test some of those ideas.\n\nLook, maybe head down to the nearest club in NSW to see how it\u2019s working out\nbefore moving forward \u201cdespite these concerns\u201d?\n\nMeanwhile, if you think this breach isn\u2019t that serious, well, for the million\nor so folks who visited one of those bars and clubs, things don\u2019t look great:\n\n> Creator of the data breach tracking website haveibeenpwned.com, Troy Hunt,\n> said the creators of the website had not released all of the information\n> they had collected.\n>\n> \u201cInevitably they do have the entire thing.\u201d\n>\n> He said the Outabox technology used by clubs scans patrons\u2019 faces and\n> matches them with their licence details.\n>\n> Mr Hunt said people whose data has appeared on the site may need to replace\n> their drivers licences.\n>\n> \u201cThere are physical addresses, there are date of birth, there are names.\n> That\u2019s not good,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not good at all.\n\nSo maybe let\u2019s not repeat the mistake online?\n\nFiled Under: age verfication, australia, bars, data breach, privacy Companies:\noutabox\n\n19 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Student Journalists Convince School To Ditch Its Spyware, But School Only Agrees To Not Spy On Its Journalists\n  * Wyden Presses FTC To Crack Down On Rampant Auto Industry Privacy Abuses\n  * Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile Finally Fined $192 Million For Abuse Of User Location Data\n  * Two Years Post-Roe: A Better Understanding Of Digital Threats\n  * People Are Slowly Realizing Their Auto Insurance Rates Are Skyrocketing Because Their Car Is Covertly Spying On Them\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cHours After Aussie Gov\u2019t Greenlights Online Age Verification\nPilot, Breach Of Mandated Verification Database For Bars Is Revealed\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n19 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 9:43 am\n\nInevitably, the people who have concerns that they voiced to the papers are a\nminority, primarily staff, with maybe a few office-holders.\n\nThe part of the government that votes, though, is inevitably jockeying for the\nnext election and won\u2019t want to appear \u201csoft on crime\u201d or \u201cfails to protect\nthe kids\u201d.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nEvil Twin says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 9:45 am\n\n# Re:\n\nAlso, the last time a news station went against the nanny state, they got\ntheir offices raided.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nThat One Guy (profile) says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 3:36 pm\n\n# Re: Re: Big Brother does not appreciate your BadThought stories\n\nThat doesn\u2019t strike me as a \u2018nanny state\u2019 so much as... ah what\u2019s the word, ah\nyes, dystopian.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nThis comment has been flagged by the community.

Verizon just released a report on\ndata breaches, and apparently they demand an e-mail address to get it. In\n2022, Canadian grocery chain Freshco started pushing their new loyalty-card\nprogram heavily, right as they were cleaning up from a data breach. The\nproduce department was pretty bare, its signs hand-written because the\ncomputers were unusable, while elsewhere in the store there were new \u201cmember\nprice\u201d signs\u2014with regular prices raised, of course, and I\u2019ve mostly stopped\ngoing there because of it.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nTheCentralScrutinizer (profile) says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 4:26 pm\n\n# Re:\n\nAnd all this when we have TV ads running, telling us to use strong passwords\nbla bla, because of the amount of Australians falling victim to online scams.\nOne news outlet has taken one of the possible \u201csolutions\u201d and more or less\nstated that that is how the proposed system would probably work.
