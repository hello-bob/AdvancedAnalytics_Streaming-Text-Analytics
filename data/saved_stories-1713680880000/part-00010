Per\nNetflix, it has now climbed to 269.60 million subs as of March 31.\n\nThese impressive Q1 results come following a better-than-expected 13.1 million\nsubscribers added for the fourth quarter of 2023, which was a Q4 record for\nNetflix. Despite this back-to-back growth worth boasting about, Netflix\nannounced Thursday it will stop reporting quarterly sub totals beginning in\n2025, a move that is sure to shock an industry that has been fueled by the\nbattle for streaming subscribers for years.\n\n### Popular on Variety\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\n## Related Stories\n\nVIP+\n\n### \u2018Civil War\u2019 Record Opening Leaves A24 With More to Prove\n\n### New \u2018The Office\u2019 Series Adds Sabrina Impacciatore, Domhnall Gleeson to\nCast\n\nThe Q1 2024 lineup that fueled Netflix\u2019s sub growth included its live-action\nadaptation of \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender,\u201d the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d creator\u2019s\nsci-fi series \u201c3 Body Problem,\u201d Guy Ritchie\u2019s \u201cThe Gentleman,\u201d the latest\nseason of \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d thriller limited series \u201cFool Me Once,\u201d Sofia\nVergara\u2019s drama \u201cGriselda,\u201d Tyler Perry movie \u201cMea Culpa,\u201d and the Millie\nBobby Brown-led \u201cDamsel,\u201d among many other new releases.\n\nFor the U.S. and Canada, paid subs grew in Q1 by 2.53 million.

And the Asian-Pacific market saw a 2.16 million increase.\n\nBeyond blowing past analysts\u2019 estimates for its Q1 subscriber additions,\nNetflix exceeded expectations for its financial results as well.\n\nWall Street forecast earnings per share of $4.26 on $8.73 billion in revenue\nfor Netflix\u2019s Q1 2024, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG,\nformerly Refinitiv. Netflix reported diluted EPS of $5.28 on $9.37 billion in\nrevenue. That revenue marks a 15% increase from Q1 2023.\n\nNet income for the quarter was $2.33 billion. Free cash flow stood at $2.13\nbillion.\n\nFor Q2, Netflix forecasts revenue of $9.49 billion and diluted EPS of $4.68\nwith net income of $2.06 billion.\n\nFor the full year 2024, Netflix expects revenue growth of 13% to 15% (compared\nwith 6.7% growth in 2022) and an operating margin of 25% (up from its prior\nforecast of 24%).\n\nVIP+ Analysis: Netflix Paid-Sharing Win Masks Long-Term Hurdles\n\nComments\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?\n\nSubscribe Today\n\n## More From Variety\n\n### New \u2018The Office\u2019 Series Adds Sabrina Impacciatore, Domhnall Gleeson to\nCast\n\n### Netflix Q1 Earnings Preview: Paid-Sharing Success Helps Obscure Long-Term\nChallenges\n\n### Netflix Acquires \u2018Calabasas\u2019 Series From Kim Kardashian, Emma Roberts and\n\u2018Pretty Little Liars\u2019 Creator I.
