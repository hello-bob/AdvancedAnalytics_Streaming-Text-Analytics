This naturally brought\nup the topic of DAU(daily active users) and MAU(monthly active users) of our\nbusiness. While initially we thought that these metrics were mere instruments\nto ascertain if people were in fact using our product, there is a deep science\ninto these metrics.\n\n##\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the late 2000s, companies like Facebook and Twitter started using daily\nactive users as engagement metrics. It was then that DAU and MAU became\npopular as a means to evaluate a \u201cgood startup\u201d.\n\n##\n\nWhy should Founder worry about engagement metrics ?\n\nTLDR - Users who find value in the product, are more likely to spread the word\nabout the product.\n\nEngagement Metrics are an indicator of how much the user likes your product\nand uses it. For some products, like our AI project documentation tool, DAUs\nand MAUs might not have been the best north star but for many social networks,\nengagement metrics like DAU and MAU are measured to assess the product\u2019s\nstickiness. There is an interesting side effect of high engagement, engaged\nusers are product\u2019s evangelist and mouthpieces. Some companies like Notion,\nhave utilized these super engaged users as brand ambassadors and build whole\ncommunities around them.\n\n###\n\nHow do super engaged users impact the growth of the product?\n\nAccording to Nir Eyal, users who continually find value in a product are more\nlikely to tell their network about it. If the user is frequently engaged with\nthe product, then the product team has more chances to design into the\nproduct; opportunities to invite their network, broadcast content and share\nthrough word of mouth. For such reasons, companies like Substack provide users\nability to embed articles on websites, and provide easy tweeting of the\nauthored articles on twitter and other social platforms. Super engaged users\nalso have an impact on the virality of the product. Viral cycle time reduces\ndrastically for products with high engagement.\n\nSuper engaged users help you to build your data moat in many cases including\nours. Power users who are actively using the product; are also leaving a\ndigital footprint behind. This digital footprint, technically called\nclickstream data, enables data science teams to personalize the experience the\nuser has on your platform. Also as the data, in the form of notes for our tool\nor tweets by the creators on Twitter/X, builds a certain\npull/affection/dependency by users for the product. The data history in most\ncases is enough to pull the user back for renewed usage. Example: we can\u2019t\nabandon our favorite ecommerce site completely, because, not only because\npersonalizes the experience, but we can\u2019t abandon our reviews, purchase\nhistory etc.\n\n###\n\nWhy hyper - focus on DAUs and MAUs can be detrimental for your business ?\n\nMany founders often start focusing on DAUs and MAUs as an indicator of\nbusiness success. While for social networks, it is indeed the go to metric,\nfor many it turns out to be a fake metric. Product\u2019s engagement metric needs a\ndeeper understanding on what reflects the real value of the product to the\nuser. For instance, we enabled data scientists to document the project as\nnotes so the true north star metric was the number of notes documented by the\ndata scientist.\n\nIt is also important to note that metrics you track change as the startup\nprogresses. During very early stages of the startup, we used the strategy of\ntracking a certain stage as the customer progressed through the onboarding\nfunnel. Initially, we focused on tracking the number of visitors to our\nwebsite as the north star metric. This approach enabled us to test our\nterminology we should be using to attract users to our product.\n\nIn case of comments and feedback, reach out to the author - Priyanka at\npn@vevesta.com or LinkedIn\n\nThanks for reading Build Startup In Public ! \ud83d\ude0d If you liked the article,\nconsider subscribing and sharing with your network\n\n##\n\nReference\n\n  1.
