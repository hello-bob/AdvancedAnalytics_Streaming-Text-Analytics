What makes stocks fade,\ninnovations slow, customers jump ship? We can agree that certain skills are\nessential. That hiring coders who can\u2019t code, salespeople who can\u2019t sell, or\narchitects who can\u2019t design is a waste. But these skills \u2014 let\u2019s call them\nvocational skills \u2014 have become the backbone of the recruitment process.\n\nBut how do you explain that similar organizations, with similarly vocationally\nskilled people, find themselves with very different outcomes? Most of the\ntextbooks that students experience and the tests they take are about\nvocational skills, the checkboxes that have to be checked to get a job. By\nmisdefining \u201cvocational\u201d and focusing on these allegedly essential skills,\nwe\u2019ve diminished the value of the other skills that matter.\n\nWe give too little respect to the other skills when we call them \u201csoft\u201d and\nimply that they\u2019re optional. What actually separates thriving organizations\nfrom struggling ones are the difficult-to-measure attitudes, processes and\nperceptions of the people who do the work.\n\nVocational skills can be taught: You\u2019re not born knowing engineering or\ncopywriting or even graphic design, therefore they must be something we can\nteach. But we let ourselves off the hook when it comes to decision-making,\neager participation, dancing with fear, speaking with authority, working in\nteams, seeing the truth, speaking the truth, inspiring others, doing more than\nwe\u2019re asked, caring and being willing to change things. We underinvest in this\ntraining, fearful that these things are innate and can\u2019t be taught. Perhaps\nthey\u2019re talents. And so we downplay them, calling them soft skills, making it\neasy for us to move on to something seemingly more urgent.\n\nAt scale, organizations pay less attention to soft skills when hiring because\nwe\u2019ve persuaded ourselves that vocational skills are impersonal and easier to\nmeasure. If it\u2019s easier to test for, it seems more important when selecting\nour team.\n\nAnd we fire slowly (and retrain rarely) when these skills are missing, because\nwe\u2019re worried about stepping on toes, being called out for getting personal or\npossibly wasting time on a lost cause.\n\nBut these skills can all be learned, as obvious skills like chess or typing\ncan be learned. We learn them accidentally, by osmosis, by the collisions we\nhave with teachers, parents, bosses and the world. Even though they\u2019re more\ndifficult to measure, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t improve them, can\u2019t practice\nthem or can\u2019t change the way we do our work.\n\nOf course we can.\n\nLet\u2019s stop calling them soft. They\u2019re interpersonal skills. Leadership skills.\nThe skills of charisma and diligence and contribution. But these modifiers,\nwhile accurate, somehow edge them away from the vocational skills, the skills\nthat we actually hire for, the skills we measure a graduate degree on.\n\nSo let\u2019s uncomfortably call them real skills instead.\n\nReal because they work, because they\u2019re at the heart of what we need today.\n\nReal because even if you\u2019ve got the vocational skills, you\u2019re no help to us\nwithout these human skills, the things that we can\u2019t write down or program a\ncomputer to do.\n\nReal skills can\u2019t replace vocational skills, of course. What they can do is\namplify the things you\u2019ve already been measuring.\n\nImagine a team member with all the traditional vocational skills: productive,\nskilled, experienced. A resume that can prove it. That\u2019s a fine baseline.\n\nNow add to it. Perceptive, charismatic, driven, focused, goal-setting,\ninspiring and motivated. Generous, empathic and consistent. A deep listener,\nwith patience. What happens to your organization when someone like that joins\nyour team?\n\nWriting in the Harvard Business Review, Lou Solomon reports that 69 percent of\nmanagers are uncomfortable communicating with their employees. I\u2019d guess that\nmany of the other 31 percent are lying.\n\nCommunicating with employees is uncomfortable because we\u2019ve built systems of\ncompliance and dominance that make it difficult. We ask people to leave their\nhumanity at the door, then use authority to change behavior. We overlay\ncorporate greed and short-term thinking with a human desire to create work\nthat matters.\n\nHow do we build people-centric organizations while also accepting the fact\nthat two thirds of our managers (presumably well paid, well trained and\nintegral to our success) are so uncomfortable doing an essential part of their\njob that they admitted it to a stranger?\n\nIn a recent survey, the Graduate Management Admission Council reported that\nalthough MBAs were strong in analytical aptitude, quantitative expertise and\ninformation-gathering ability, they were sorely lacking in other critical\nareas that employers find equally attractive: strategic thinking, written and\noral communication, leadership and adaptability. Are these mutually exclusive?\nMust we trade one for the other?\n\nThe foundation of all real skills is this one: the confidence and permission\nto talk to one another. Not to manage, belittle, intimidate or control. Simply\nto seek to be understood and to do the work to understand.\n\nExcerpted from The Song of Significance: A New Manifesto for Teams by Seth\nGodin, in agreement with Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a\ndivision of Penguin Random House LLC.
