Its ever-escalating challenges have\n> amplified the importance of digital forensics, particularly in the analysis\n> of heap dumps from main memory. In this context, the Secure Shell protocol\n> (SSH) designed for encrypted communications, serves as both a safeguard and\n> a potential veil for malicious activities. This research project focuses on\n> predicting SSH keys in OpenSSH memory dumps, aiming to enhance protective\n> measures against illicit access and enable the development of advanced\n> security frameworks or tools like honeypots. This Masterarbeit is situated\n> within the broader SmartVMI project, and seeks to build upon existing\n> research on key prediction in OpenSSH heap dumps. Utilizing machine learning\n> (ML) and deep learning models, the study aims to refine features for\n> embedding techniques and explore innovative methods for effective key\n> detection based on recent advancements in Knowledge Graph and ML. The\n> objective is to accurately predict the presence and location of SSH keys\n> within memory dumps. This work builds upon, and aims to enhance, the\n> foundations laid by SSHkex and SmartKex, enriching both the methodology and\n> the results of the original research while exploring the untapped potential\n> of newly proposed approaches. The current thesis dives into memory graph\n> modelization from raw binary heap dump files. Each memory graph can support\n> a range of embeddings that can be used directly for model training, through\n> the use of classic ML models and graph neural network. It offers an in-depth\n> discussion on the current state-of-the-art in key prediction for OpenSSH\n> memory dumps, research questions, experimental setups, programs development,\n> results as well as discussing potential future directions.\n\nComments:| The report contains 148 pages, 22 figures, 17 tables and 34\nlistings.
