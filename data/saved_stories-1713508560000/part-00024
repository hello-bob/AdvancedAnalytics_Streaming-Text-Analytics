Then it was everything.\n\nI watched a man on YouTube cook the chicken, imagining what it would be like\nto taste it. Even if he had prepared it in front of me, I couldn\u2019t have eaten\nit. Inflammation from Crohn\u2019s disease had connected the tissues of my small\nintestine and my bladder together via fistula, and I did not want to pee out a\nroast chicken.\n\nInstead, I was on a form of artificial food called total parenteral nutrition\n(TPN, for short). All my nutrition and water were pumped from an IV bag into\nmy veins through a tube in my arm. Even though I had enough functional\nnutrition in my body my brain screamed, you\u2019re hungry, constantly.\n\nI watched Gordon Ramsay make French pan sauces and tuna with lime zest. I\nwatched a man on Netflix who seemed to know nothing about food eating Khao soi\nin Thailand. Watching cooking shows felt like picking a scab\u2014somehow like\nrelief and suffering at the same time.\n\nEventually, my wife, Erica, became concerned for my mental health. \u201cI can\u2019t\nstop. It\u2019s a compulsion,\u201d I would say.\n\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d she\u2019d add.\n\nTo diminish her concern, I settled for watching Anthony Bourdain\u2019s Parts\nUnknown, because the show\u2019s travel element obscured the food.\n\nCrohn\u2019s is an inflammatory bowel disease. The cause is unknown, but it appears\nto be due to a haywire immune system that attacks the digestive tract\u2014in my\ncase, the end of the small bowel. Every Crohn\u2019s patient experiences different\nsymptoms. Some have daily mild belly aches and unruly diarrhea. I\u2019ve always\nexperienced near-normal health punctuated by periods of wild pain, nausea, and\nweight loss. The most common treatments are steroids, anti-inflammatory and\nimmunosuppressant drugs, and, as a last resort, surgery to remove any bowel\nbeyond repair. In my thirties, the combination of fresh inflammation and scar\ntissue from a teenage surgery had blocked up my bowel. Eating became like\ngambling\u2014sometimes I won, but mostly I lost.\n\nI was diagnosed at 11. Food had become repellant to me. I remember sitting,\ntwig thin, in an emergency room waiting area with my worried parents. A\ncooking show was on TV. The show\u2019s host was making a cheese omelet that looked\nas appealing to me as fried fertilizer. \u201cI can\u2019t even look at that,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh? That looks good to me,\u201d Mom said, aiming less to change my mind on the\nomelet than confirm to herself how sick I was.\n\nThe year after I was diagnosed my doctor, worried I was losing so much weight\nI wouldn\u2019t get enough calories through regular eating, put me on a nutritional\ntherapy called enteral nutrition\u2014an infusion of milky formula into the belly.\nI had to snake a flexible rubber tube up my nose and into my stomach every\nnight, tearing it out in a rush before school in the morning. The tube would\nsometimes disconnect from the IV bag while I was sleeping, the pump whirring\naway until morning. I\u2019d wake up drenched in sticky formula with an empty\nstomach.\n\nWhen my doctor gave me the option, I chose to guzzle the formula during the\nday to have extra hours without the tube at night (drinking the volume of\nformula required for nutrition would have been nearly impossible). I was also\nallowed to drink clear fluids, so my parents kept the fridge stocked with\nlemon-lime soda and JELL-O. But, without that shackle of a tube, I would not\nhave stayed alive as a preteen.\n\nDoctors have used enteral nutrition since the early 20th century, pumping\nbroths and formulas directly into the stomach either through a tube placed\ninto the nose and down into the stomach, like mine, or through an incision in\nthe belly. However, enteral nutrition relies on patients having a working\ndigestive system. Doctors thought it was impossible to bypass the digestive\ntract and get enough nutrition into patients through a vein, believing it\nrequired so much liquid, and such a high concentration of chemical nutrients,\nthat it would cause inflammation and burning when administered.\n\nGet the Longreads Top 5 Email\n\nKickstart your weekend by getting the week\u2019s very best reads, hand-picked and\nintroduced by Longreads editors, delivered to your inbox every Friday\nmorning\u2014and keep up with all our picks by subscribing to our daily update.\n\nIt was Stanley Dudrick, a strong-minded surgical resident at the University of\nPennsylvania, who would change that. One weekend in November 1961, Dudrick was\nleft to look after three surgical patients. The patients had had different\nprocedures, but over the weekend, all three died. Having watched his\nsupervisor, Dr. Rhoads, a revered surgeon, perform technically flawless\nsurgeries on each of them, Dudrick concluded their deaths were his fault. When\nhe told Rhoads on Monday, he was assured the patients were all frail from\ntheir operations, and their gastrointestinal tracts were struggling to absorb\nenough nutrients to overcome the weakness. The patients didn\u2019t die from his\nineptitude\u2014they died of malnutrition.\n\nA fire was lit in Dudrick. He requested leave from his surgical internship and\nworked out of a small lab in the hospital\u2019s basement, determined to find a\nsolution. For years, he honed the composition for a nutrition formula that\ncould be delivered via veins, avoiding the intestines. By the late \u201960s, he\nhad finally found a stable mixture of water, carbohydrates, proteins, trace\nelements, fats, salts, and multivitamins\u2014everything you need from a balanced\nmeal, just with the color and smell of Elmer\u2019s glue.\n\nBut the concentrated nutrients did burn. \u201cI\u2019ve actually put it in my own\nvein,\u201d Dudrick told Dr. Rhoads, showing his forearm. \u201cIt burns like liquid\nfire.\u201d To banish the blaze, he knew the formula would have to be injected\nclose to the heart, to allow for fast dilution around the body. When he kept a\nbeagle named Stinky alive, nourished only with the nutrient combination\ninfused into his vena cava (a large vein that returns deoxygenated blood to\nthe heart), Dudrick was convinced it would work for humans. He\u2019d invented TPN.\nSince then, it has saved millions of lives.\n\nA doctor once told me that when a tissue is inflamed for long enough, the\nconnections that hold cells together start to break down, and the tissue\nsoftens. When that happens, tissues can merge, forming a little tunnel known\nas a fistula. A CT scan showed that my bowel had formed several fistulas\nlooping on themselves\u2014the path of digestion more a maze than a hallway.\n\nBy knocking back the immune system with immunosuppressants and nutrition from\nTPN\u2014to rest the bowel by not eating or drinking\u2014fistulas can sometimes close\nthemselves. This was the hope for me.\n\nA thin IV catheter called a peripherally inserted central catheter, or\nPICC\u2014like the one Dudrick used in Stinky\u2014was placed in a vein on the inside of\nmy arm and threaded into my vena cava. A nurse named Stan inserted the PICC\nwith the intense focus of a true craftsman. He wore earbuds and sang \u201cI can\u2019t\nget enough of your love\u201d by Barry White under his breath.\n\nSince I would be sent home with the TPN, a different nurse taught me how to\nrig it up myself. She explained how I would set up the TPN every night and run\nit over 12 hours. I had to inject a personalized pre-prepared slurry of\nmultivitamins into an IV bag, prime the pump, and flush the PICC with saline.\nShe explained the buttons and the beeps on the pump that squirted the mixture\nthrough the tubes and into my body. Everything was vigorously wiped with\nalcohol because any bacteria would be injected straight into my heart.\n\n\u201cYou got all that?\u201d the nurse asked after her demonstration.\n\nI had been preoccupied thinking about how weird not eating would be at home.\nLike many thirty-something married couples in San Francisco, Erica and I lived\nwith five other tirelessly social roommates. One ran a start-up from the\nliving room. The house was often standing room only. And what did people do\nwhen they hung around in groups? They cooked and they drank. Early on in the\nflare-up, the group shared a rich and earthy-tasting homemade coq au vin. I\nhelped to meticulously peel dozens of pearl onions. I paid the price later\nthat night.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be okay,\u201d I said to the nurse.\n\nWe weren\u2019t. At home that first night, we fumbled to inject the components into\nthe bag and attach it to the pump and my arm. Then Erica spotted a bubble\nmarching up the tube, and we mashed at the stop button on the pump.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, right?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. What if it explodes your heart?\u201d\n\nOut to the kitchen, Erica went.\n\nPolling the two dozen or so people cooking in the house, she found one doctor\nand one nurse to choose from. The bubble could stay; the feeding began.\n\n> Early on in the flare-up, the group shared a rich and earthy-tasting\n> homemade coq au vin. I helped to meticulously peel dozens of pearl onions. I\n> paid the price later that night.\n\nOn one of the first nights at home, Erica\u2019s best friend visited to apply\ntherapeutic face masks to pass the time. In a selfie with our dingy-green\nmasks, Erica beams with sweet enthusiasm. I look stone-faced and far away. Our\nhousemate Rory later brought some puzzles for us to do together. Everyone in\nthe house became obsessed with them. I could hear them celebrating a\ndiscovered piece long after I snuck away to lie down. I felt weak from being\nsick. But I also felt weak for not being stronger, for not executing a\ngracious interest in the ways people tried to help.\n\nThose first weeks, I mostly slept. When I was awake, my brain was\nfrighteningly alert. My body, on the other hand, looked and felt like wet\ncardboard. The anxiety of hunger settled under my ribs like the feeling you\nget when you\u2019re about to burst into tears. The hum of the refrigerator alone\nwas enough to make me want to bury my head in the backyard. I often dreamt of\ndonuts, and once, of my sister-in-law\u2019s mother, a tenacious Serbian woman,\nbringing me a roasting pan full of sausages. By the time I had my first dose\nof TPN, I had gone without eating for nearly a week and a half, sustained only\nby fluids in the hospital. Then, due to a holiday and clerical error, I was\nleft on a dose half of what I required\u2014intended to see how well I handled the\nslurry\u2014for a week longer than expected. I assumed the hunger would subside\nwith enough nutrition. But even after weeks on full TPN, I still could\u2019ve\neaten the plastic bags it came in.\n\nEveryone starts with around 22 feet of small bowel, but if surgery cuts it\ndown to less than seven feet, the body can\u2019t absorb water and nutrients\nanymore. With my bowel so badly matted together, surgeons might need to remove\na lot, and if they removed enough\u2014on top of the two feet I lost as a\nteenager\u2014it could mean TPN for life. With the state my mind was in, that was\nunimaginable.\n\nWhile scientists have figured out extraordinary ways to keep patients who\ncan\u2019t eat alive, they haven\u2019t yet figured out how to deal with what it does to\nus mentally. I\u2019d been through a lot with Crohn\u2019s before, even believing that\nwho I was as a person was largely the result of these struggles. But TPN was\ndifferent. It was like I was sitting in a lawn chair (albeit a rickety one) at\na picnic when somebody came along and kicked a leg out\u2014the pasta salad that\nmight\u2019ve been in my hand, flung into oblivion.\n\nEating is an experience that humans share with all other animals. Organic\nmaterial is consumed and broken down during digestion. In return, the body\nadapts nutritious molecules into a host of cellular processes and adenosine\ntriphosphate, or ATP, which cells turn into energy. During digestion,\nphysiological responses are triggered in the brain by the vagus nerve,\ncontributing to the feeling of fullness. Hormonal signals also act on the\nbrain: leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells, sends signals to the\nhypothalamus to inhibit hunger. In patients on TPN or enteral nutrition,\nleptin does increase after infusions, but it doesn\u2019t appear to be well\ncorrelated with decreased hunger.\n\nWhile the hormones and neural signals are crucial to satiation, so is the\nsensory experience that takes place during the first phase of digestion\u2014the\ncephalic phase\u2014which begins at the sight of food. The pleasure that we take\nduring this phase appears to be important to feeling satisfied. Monkeys on TPN\ncontinued to eat real food even when their caloric needs were met. Studies in\nhealthy humans found that people on TPN reported being as hungry as those\ninjected with only lactated Ringer\u2019s, a solution designed to replenish\nelectrolytes and fluid rather than calories. I asked an on-call\ngastroenterologist once what I could do for the hunger.\n\n\u201cYou can try chewing meat and spitting it out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said.\n\nOf all the things doctors have said to me, this struck me as the most\nderanged. I never even considered her advice because I didn\u2019t miss the taste\nof food, so much as I missed the social aspect and, more so, not feeling\nhungry. Carrying a spittoon to spit out chicken like a confused cowboy wasn\u2019t\ngoing to accomplish either. But now I begrudgingly admit she was on to\nsomething. Chewing food, even without swallowing, helps to activate the\ncephalic phase, triggering a partial sense of satiation. The doctor never\nexplained this to me.\n\nPaul Smeets, a nutritional neuroscientist at the University Medical Center\nUtrecht in the Netherlands, told me that part of the problem is that patients\non enteral and parenteral nutrition receive the infusion over such a long\nperiod. \u201cThey sneak nutrition into people so slowly that the brain is never\naware it\u2019s happening,\u201d he told me. The homeostatic feedback produced from\neating a meal, that allows the brain to feel satisfied, is missing. TPN and\nenteral nutrition are, in effect, a form of sensory deprivation. My hunger was\na natural neurological reaction that could be traced back for millennia.\n\nWhile on TPN, I stayed away from the kitchen as best I could, mostly because\nit felt as if I was gawking. In the evenings, Erica would come home from work\nand I\u2019d close my laptop screen, where Bourdain was, say, fishing for dinner in\nsouthern Italy, and we\u2019d lie on the bed. Erica would ask if I farted out my\npenis that day. I\u2019d say not today, and then we\u2019d laugh at the ridiculousness\nof what a good day looked like. She ended up eating less. Family members of\npatients on artificial nutrition often feel guilty about eating, some even\nlose weight, I learned. This unearthly relationship with food wasn\u2019t what I\nwanted to offer her, but it was what I served, like pulling out a burnt tray\nof hors d\u2019oeuvres just as the guests arrived. Even though she smiled and\naccepted our life the way it was, we hadn\u2019t even been married for a year. I\nwondered if anything so young could thrive so undernourished.\n\n> Erica would ask if I farted out my penis that day. I\u2019d say not today, and\n> then we\u2019d laugh at the ridiculousness of what a good day looked like.\n\nWhile she was out, hidden in our room, I gorged on the cooking shows that\ncaused her concern. In the late \u201970s, doctors learned that patients on TPN\noften experience several stages of adaptation, including grief\u2014mourning the\nloss of food rather than the death of someone close. Watching cooking shows\nseemed like a form of remembering and searching for what I had lost. When I\ntried to stop, I felt like I was from a different planet, separate from\neveryone else whose lives swirled around food. When watching cooking shows, I\ncould fake being human. Since the cephalic phase of digestion begins at the\nsight of food, even before putting a crumb in one\u2019s mouth, it\u2019s also possible\nI was subconsciously attempting to veer onto an ancient road to satiety even\nif, for me, it didn\u2019t lead anywhere.\n\nWhen I went looking on the internet, I found I was not alone. I asked why\npeople watched cooking shows on the Crohn\u2019s disease subreddit. One user said\nthey had no idea, but \u201cthe only show I watched was Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\nwith Guy Fieri, which is extra weird because I was a vegetarian.\u201d Another\nbought cannoli and made their partner describe the taste in detail as if it\nwere their own personal cooking show.\n\nThe things that I, and others on TPN, experienced, are not unlike the\npsychological effects seen in people who are physically deprived of food. In\n1944, 36 men entered a study after seeing a brochure passed out at the\nUniversity of Minnesota asking, Will you starve so that others will be better\nfed? The 36 participants were underfed until they lost 25% of their body\nweight. As the experiment progressed, Ancel Keys, the nutritionist running the\nstudy, noticed odd psychological effects. The participants became increasingly\nfocused on food, collecting recipes, and taking down pin-ups of women to hang\npictures of food. One even decided he would change careers and become a chef.\nAfter the study, most participants gorged themselves long after their weight\nreturned to normal.\n\nWithout food, we become preoccupied with it. Food is as evolutionarily\nimportant as pain and sex. Animals that don\u2019t take an interest in these\nstimuli don\u2019t fare well. Research shows that noticing food and remembering its\nlocation is a base instinct for all humans that becomes heightened when\nhungry.\n\nPatients on TPN are functionally fed but are perhaps not neurologically aware\nof it. Of course, physiological food deprivation is different (unimaginable,\nto me) from a psychological one, but we still seem to hyper-focus on what we\ncan\u2019t have rather than shy away from it. With the way appetite brain signaling\nworks, Smeets says it makes sense that some overlapping effects of starvation\nmight take place in the brain, causing an obsession with food and all the\nbehavioral baggage that comes with it.\n\nAfter nearly a month without anything, not even water, by mouth, my symptoms\nstabilized and my doctor said I could try drinking clear liquids. Since I had\ntasted only the inside of my mouth for three weeks, the white cranberry juice\nwas electrifying. I ate raspberry JELL-O in a blaze of magnificent relief.\nWith what I now attribute to the cephalic phase the world became slightly more\nbearable. Then, after two months on TPN and a clear liquid diet, the home care\nnurse pulled the PICC. I can\u2019t remember exactly why this decision was made,\nbecause at the time I didn\u2019t care. I was going to be a full-time eater again.\nEven though I went slow, everything was a feast.\n\nErica and I drove to her parents\u2019 house in Southern California for\nThanksgiving. I ate the turkey dinner cautiously as if it was still alive.\nEven then, Erica had to drive the whole seven hours back to San Francisco\nbecause I felt the familiar spasms of pain and gurgles of food going into my\nbladder. At the hospital, they decided the fistula likely wouldn\u2019t close on\nits own. I was scheduled for surgery two days after Christmas.\n\n> Since I had tasted only the inside of my mouth for three weeks, the white\n> cranberry juice was electrifying.\n\nAnd so, after only three weeks without TPN, eating was out, and the PICC went\nback in. It was placed by two nurses who encouraged me to relax while saying\nthings like, \u201cIs that in? No, that doesn\u2019t look right.\u201d\n\nWell, you\u2019re no Stan, I thought.\n\nRory came to visit me in the hospital one night. \u201cDid you know they make 3D\npuzzles?\u201d he asked, passing Erica a cheeseburger that she took outside. When a\nnurse came in with medications on a tray decorated with red gingham, Rory\nstopped talking and stared. \u201cThe world is so twisted sometimes,\u201d he said after\nthe nurse left, laughing and shaking his head. \u201cWho do they think they are\nbringing your drugs in on a French fry tray?\u201d I\u2019d considered this question\nmyself hundreds of times. After Rory and Erica left that night, with the\ndarkness outside swallowing my tiny hospital room, I opened my laptop and\nwatched a show where hunters in Montana cooked deer ribs on a campfire.\n\nAt Christmas, Erica\u2019s family came to San Francisco because it would\u2019ve been\nimpossible for me to travel. They cooked Swedish and Korean food \u2014traditions\nfrom both sides of Erica\u2019s family. I chose to walk our dog.\n\nHumans diverge from animals when it comes to our social and cultural meaning\nbehind food. As Sue McLaughlin, one of the authors of The Meaning of Food,\nsaid, \u201cLike all animals, we eat to survive. But as humans, we transform simple\nfeeding into the ritual art of dining, creating customs and rites that turn\nout to be as crucial to our well-being as are proteins and carbohydrates.\u201d\n\nIn addition to sensory deprivation, not eating is social deprivation. In a\nsurvey of 51 patients on enteral nutrition, most patients complained that they\nwere socially isolated and experienced a loss of identity. What you cook, how\nyou cook for others, and when you eat provide structure to your days and a\nsense of self. Food is a form of communication. Without it, you are adrift and\nmissing a functional language.\n\nThey mostly use qualitative surveys to study the impacts of nutritional\ntherapy on patient quality of life. Even if the physiological need for food is\nmet, there is undeniably a physical and psychological effect for patients on\nTPN. Up to half of patients report being constantly tired; up to one-third\nhave anxiety; one quarter are clinically depressed.\n\nI recently found a note on my computer titled \u201cFood to Eat,\u201d that listed what\nI was craving when I was on TPN: black pepper crabs, pecan waffles, meat pies,\nTurkish delight, and, of course, roast chicken. I have no memory of how I came\nto want these particular foods. Instead, I remember all the ways my body told\nme something was wrong. But the hunger, the sense of loss, and the search for\nconnection in cooking shows were a perfectly normal response, as it turns out.\nMaybe as close to the human experience as you can get.\n\nAfter the surgery, I woke up in a room on the hospital\u2019s fifth floor that\nlooked over the city\u2019s tallest building, the newly built Salesforce Tower.\nErica bounced as she told me the surgeon had performed a masterful operation.\nHe removed only six inches of bowel and fixed the bladder. The surgery rescued\nme from any more TPN in the immediate future while nudging me ever so slightly\ncloser to a future without food\u2014again, relief and suffering at the same time.\n\nMy surgeon came in late one evening. \u201cI hate that thing,\u201d he said, nodding\ntoward the Salesforce Tower out the window. \u201cIt looks like a giant penis.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d I said. \u201cI think it looks like a burrito.\u201d\n\nAndrew Chapman is a science and medicine writer based in Truckee, California.\nHis work has appeared in Scientific American, Hakai Magazine, and Eos, amongst\nothers.\n\nEditor: Carolyn Wells Fact-checker: Julie Schwietert Collazo Copyeditor:\nKrista Stevens\n\nTagged: Andrew Chapman, chronic illness, crohn's, crohn's disease, Food,\nlongreaads, starvation, TPN\n\n## Support Longreads\n\nBecome a Longreads Member for just $5 per month\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nFollow us on Tumblr\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Instagram\n\nGet the Longreads Weekly Email\n\nProcessing...\n\nSuccess!
