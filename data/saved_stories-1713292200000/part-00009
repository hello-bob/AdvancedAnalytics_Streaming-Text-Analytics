A decade ago Godot wasn't up for the job of being an\nembeddable engine but with its enormous success over the past decade and new\nwork on making it more embed-friendly, this goal may finally be realized with\nthe proposed LibGodot.\n\nOver the past year Miguel has been working on support along with partners to\nbe able to \"embed chunks of Godot in discrete components in my iPad UI.\" With\nLibGodot, that's a reality. LibGodot would make it easy to embed arbitrary\nGodot scenes into other apps.\n\nThose wanting to learn more about Miguel's thoughts on embeddable game engines\nand the work happening now for Godot can be found via this blog post.\n\nThis pull request for upstream Godot is what would introduce LibGodot to make\nit possible to embed Godot into another application more easily. That LibGodot\nPR has more details as well on the possibilities and design.\n\n24 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nFEX-Emu 2404 Optimization Can Take Memcpy From 2-3 GB/s To 88 GB/s\n\nLinux 6.10 To Merge NTSYNC Driver For Emulating Windows NT Synchronization\nPrimitives\n\nOpenRazer 3.8 Brings Support For Newer Razer Devices On Linux\n\nSDL 3.0 Will Now Prefer PipeWire Over PulseAudio\n\nLutris 0.5.17 Game Manager Brings Bug Fixes, Library Syncing & New Runners\n\nSDL 2.30.2 Released Along WIth New SDL3 Preview\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
