The city is one of just two UNESCO cities of\nliterature in the country.\n\n\"We just have voracious readers in Seattle,\u201d said Elena Gutierrez, collection\nservices manager at Seattle Public Library.\n\nIn the past four years, reading in the city has also shifted away from print\nbooks and toward digital options, like e-books and e-audiobooks.\n\nSeattle Public Library is number eight in the world when it comes to digital\ncheckouts from Overdrive, a global distributor of digital books and makers of\nthe Libby app. King County Library System is third. Seattle is the only metro\narea that appears on the list twice.\n\nDigital reading is convenient \u2014 no print book to drag around \u2014 and also makes\nstories and information more accessible for many with disabilities, including\ndyslexia and vision impairment.\n\nBut the increasing demand for digital books is causing problems for local\nlibraries. Last month, SPL announced it was reducing the number of digital\nholds patrons can place from 25 down to 10.\n\nThe reason: Digital books are extremely expensive for libraries, even though\nthey\u2019re generally cheaper than print books for an individual consumer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen three to 10 times as much charged to a library for the same exact\nmaterial,\u201d said Kyle Courtney, the director of copyright information policy at\nHarvard Library. Courtney is also a founder of the eBook Study Group, a\nnonprofit working to make digital materials more affordable for libraries\nacross the country.\n\nI\u2019ve seen three to 10 times as much charged to a library for the same exact\nmaterial. Kyle Courtney, copyright lawyer at harvard library and founder of\nthe ebook study group\n\nGutierrez pointed to Brittney Spears\u2019 2023 memoir \"The Woman In Me\" as a prime\nexample of the budget challenges that e-books pose. SPL paid the book\u2019s\npublisher $17.81 for each physical copy it bought, a few dollars cheaper than\nwhat an individual would pay in a bookstore.\n\nElectronic copies were a totally different story. The e-book and e-audiobook\nare about $17 for a consumer, but the library paid more than three times that\nprice: $64.99 for an e-book and $59.99 for a digital audiobook.\n\nCombine the increasing demand for digital books and the higher prices, and\nthings add up quickly.\n\n\u201cIn total, the library's physical copies at one point were $2,500 that we had\ninvested,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cBut the digital copies cost us $35,000.\u201d\n\nThat price tag is only the start of the story. Publishers largely don\u2019t allow\nlibraries to own digital books outright \u2014 they have to license them for a set\nperiod of time or a set number of checkouts.\n\nIn the case of \"The Woman In Me,\" each copy is only rented to the library for\ntwo years, then they have to pay again to keep using it.\n\n\u201cIt's like throwing money directly out a window,\u201d Courtney said.\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge that library systems across the country are struggling with,\nfrom small local organizations to the nation\u2019s biggest research institutions.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that e-book licenses as they currently are turn libraries into\nNetflix and Hulu. We don't own anything. We have to continually pay for it and\ncan go away at a moment's notice,\u201d Courtney said. \u201cThat idea of, 'last day to\nsee this series,' right? You see that on Netflix and Hulu all the time. It's\nliterally what's happening to our collections libraries. They're disappearing\nunless we pay more.\u201d\n\nSeattle Public Library buys new digital books for one of two reasons: First,\nwhen a new book is published. And second, when there\u2019s high demand for a given\ntitle. One of the library\u2019s goals is to keep hold waits down.\n\nAs of publishing, the e-book title with the longest hold line was \"The Heaven\n& Earth Grocery Store\" by James McBride. SPL has licenses for 300 copies, but\nmore than 2,000 patrons had the book on hold. It would take someone joining\nthe list roughly three months to get a copy.\n\nBy reducing the number of holds each patron can place, the library is\nessentially asking readers to be more choosy about which books to get in line\nfor. Gutierrez said it\u2019s already having an impact on their budget.\n\n\u201cWe have reduced the costs for holds by a significant amount,\u201d she said. That\nmeans the library can put that money toward other titles.\n\n\u201cWe want depth and breadth to the collection. We want to be able to offer a\nvariety of titles and not just feed the best sellers,\" Gutierrez said. \"So,\nthis allows us to have funds redistributed also to acquire new content rather\nthan have hundreds of copies of fewer titles.\u201d\n\nA digital reader for an eBook.\n\nAlireza Zarafshani / Unsplash\n\nWhile adjusting policies may offer short-term relief, Courtney said the larger\nissue of e-book licensing isn\u2019t likely to change without intervention.\n\nHe\u2019s working with states across the country to introduce legislation that\nwould use existing consumer protection and contract laws to bring costs down.\nIt would work in a similar way to net neutrality laws that prevent internet\nservice providers from giving certain online activities or sites preferential\ntreatment.\n\n\u201cWe're saying, \u2018Dear publishers, you want to do business in this state?\nWhatever state adopts this particular law? Well, we have millions and millions\nof dollars, so the contract needs to be reflective of the library mission and\ninclude these terms or forbid these terms,'\u201d Courtney said.\n\nThe Washington Library Association has drafted a bill in partnership with the\neBook Study Group and is hoping to introduce it during next year\u2019s legislative\nsession. A spokesperson for the group said they\u2019ve started having preliminary\ndiscussions with state lawmakers on the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, local libraries offer lists of books that are available to\ncheck out with no wait through the e-book and audiobook app Libby. And many\nlocal libraries, including Seattle Public Library and the King County Library\nSystem, offer cross-system access for Washington residents looking for their\nnext read.\n\nbooks\n\n#### Share your thoughts on this story\n\nWhy you can trust KUOW\n\n  * Clare McGrane\n\n##### Podcast Producer\n\nClare produces KUOW\u2019s news podcast, Seattle Now.
