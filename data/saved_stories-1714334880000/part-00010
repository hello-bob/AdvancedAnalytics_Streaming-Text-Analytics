For other people called George\nStephenson, see George Stephenson (disambiguation). For the similar name, see\nGeorge Stevenson (disambiguation).\n\nGeorge Stephenson  \n---  \nBorn| (1781-06-09)9 June 1781Wylam, Northumberland, England  \nDied| 12 August 1848(1848-08-12) (aged 67)Tapton House, Chesterfield,\nDerbyshire, England  \nResting place| Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield  \nSpouse(s)| Frances Henderson (1802\u20131806) Elizabeth Hindmarsh (1820\u20131845) Ellen\nGregory (1848)  \nChildren| Robert Stephenson Frances Stephenson (died in infancy)  \n  \nGeorge Stephenson (9 June 1781 \u2013 12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer\nand mechanical engineer during the Industrial Revolution.^[1] Renowned as the\n\"Father of Railways\",^[2] Stephenson was considered by the Victorians as a\ngreat example of diligent application and thirst for improvement. His chosen\nrail gauge, sometimes called \"Stephenson gauge\",^[i] was the basis for the\n4-foot-8+1\u20442-inch (1.435 m) standard gauge used by most of the world's\nrailways.\n\nPioneered by Stephenson, rail transport was one of the most important\ntechnological inventions of the 19th century and a key component of the\nIndustrial Revolution. Built by George and his son Robert's company Robert\nStephenson and Company, the Locomotion No. 1 was the first steam locomotive to\ncarry passengers on a public rail line, the Stockton and Darlington Railway in\n1825. George also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world\nto use locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in\n1830.\n\n## Childhood[edit]\n\nGeorge Stephenson was born on 9 June 1781 in Wylam, Northumberland, which is 9\nmiles (15 km) west of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was the second child of Robert\nand Mabel Stephenson,^[3] neither of whom could read or write. Robert was the\nfireman for Wylam Colliery pumping engine, earning a very low wage, so there\nwas no money for schooling. At 17, Stephenson became an engineman at Water Row\nPit in Newburn nearby. George realised the value of education and paid to\nstudy at night school to learn reading, writing and arithmetic \u2013 he was\nilliterate until the age of 18.^[4]\n\nIn 1801 he began work at Black Callerton Colliery south of Ponteland as a\n'brakesman', controlling the winding gear at the pit.^[5] In 1802 he married\nFrances Henderson and moved to Willington Quay, east of Newcastle. There he\nworked as a brakesman while they lived in one room of a cottage. George made\nshoes and mended clocks to supplement his income.\n\nDial Cottage, West Moor, Killingworth. The sun-dial made and installed by\nGeorge Stephenson is above the front door.\n\nTheir first child Robert was born in 1803, and in 1804 they moved to Dial\nCottage at West Moor, near Killingworth where George worked as a brakesman at\nKillingworth Pit. Their second child, a daughter, was born in July 1805. She\nwas named Frances after her mother. The child died after just three weeks and\nwas buried in St Bartholomew's Church, Long Benton north of Newcastle.\n\nIn 1806 George's wife Frances died of consumption (tuberculosis). She was\nburied in the same churchyard as their daughter on 16 May 1806, though the\nlocation of the grave is lost.^[6]\n\nGeorge decided to find work in Scotland and left Robert with a local woman\nwhile he went to work in Montrose. After a few months he returned, probably\nbecause his father was blinded in a mining accident. He moved back into a\ncottage at West Moor and his unmarried sister Eleanor moved in to look after\nRobert. In 1811 the pumping engine at High Pit, Killingworth was not working\nproperly and Stephenson offered to improve it.^[7] He did so with such success\nthat he was promoted to enginewright for the collieries at Killingworth,\nresponsible for maintaining and repairing all the colliery engines. He became\nan expert in steam-driven machinery.^[8]\n\n## Early projects[edit]\n\n### The Safety Lamp[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

At the same time, the eminent\nscientist and Cornishman Humphry Davy was also looking at the problem. Despite\nhis lack of scientific knowledge, Stephenson, by trial and error, devised a\nlamp in which the air entered via tiny holes, through which the flames of the\nlamp could not pass.\n\nA month before Davy presented his design to the Royal Society, Stephenson\ndemonstrated his own lamp to two witnesses by taking it down Killingworth\nColliery and holding it in front of a fissure from which firedamp was issuing.\nThe two designs differed; Davy's lamp was surrounded by a screen of gauze,\nwhereas Stephenson's prototype lamp had a perforated plate containing a glass\ncylinder. For his invention Davy was awarded \u00a32000, whilst Stephenson was\naccused of stealing the idea from Davy,^[9] because he was not seen as an\nadequate scientist who could have produced the lamp by any approved scientific\nmethod.\n\nStephenson, having come from the North-East, spoke with a broad Northumberland\naccent and not the 'Language of Parliament,' which made him seem lowly.\nRealizing this, he made a point of educating his son Robert in a private\nschool, where he was taught to speak in Standard English with a Received\nPronunciation accent. It was due to this, in their future dealings with\nParliament, that it became clear that the authorities preferred Robert to his\nfather.^[citation needed]\n\nA local committee of enquiry gathered in support of Stephenson, exonerated\nhim, proved he had been working separately to create the 'Geordie Lamp', and\nawarded him \u00a31,000, but Davy and his supporters refused to accept their\nfindings, and would not see how an uneducated man such as Stephenson could\ncome up with the solution he had. In 1833 a House of Commons committee found\nthat Stephenson had equal claim to having invented the safety lamp. Davy went\nto his grave believing that Stephenson had stolen his idea. The Stephenson\nlamp was used almost exclusively in North East England, whereas the Davy lamp\nwas used everywhere else. The experience gave Stephenson a lifelong distrust\nof London-based, theoretical, scientific experts.^[8]\n\nIn his book George and Robert Stephenson, the author L.T.C. Rolt relates that\nopinion varied about the two lamps' efficiency: that the Davy Lamp gave more\nlight, but the Geordie Lamp was thought to be safer in a more gaseous\natmosphere. He made reference to an incident at Oaks Colliery in Barnsley\nwhere both lamps were in use. Following a sudden strong influx of gas the tops\nof all the Davy Lamps became red hot (which had in the past caused an\nexplosion, and in so doing risked another), whilst all the Geordie Lamps\nsimply went out.\n\nThere is a theory that it was Stephenson who indirectly gave the name of\n\"Geordies\" to the people of the North East of England. By this theory, the\nname of the Geordie Lamp attached to the North East pit men themselves. By\n1866 any native of Newcastle upon Tyne could be called a Geordie.^[10]\n\n### Locomotives[edit]\n\nCornishman Richard Trevithick is credited with the first realistic design for\na steam locomotive, the \"Puffing Devil\", in 1801.^[11]^[12] Later, he visited\nTyneside and built an engine there for a mine-owner. Several local men were\ninspired by this, and designed their own engines.^[citation needed]\n\nEarly Stephenson locomotive in Samuel Smiles' Lives of the Engineers\n(1862).^[7] Called an 1816 Killingworth Colliery locomotive (often claimed to\nbe Bl\u00fccher), it looks more like the slightly later Hetton colliery railway\nlocomotives whose 1852 replica Lyons was still operating in Smiles' time.^[7]\n\nStephenson designed his first locomotive in 1814, a travelling engine designed\nfor hauling coal on the Killingworth wagonway named Bl\u00fccher after the Prussian\ngeneral Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher (It was suggested the name sprang from\nBl\u00fccher's rapid march of his army in support of Wellington at Waterloo).^[ii]\nBl\u00fccher was modelled on Matthew Murray's locomotive Willington, which George\nstudied at Kenton and Coxlodge colliery on Tyneside, and was constructed in\nthe colliery workshop behind Stephenson's home, Dial Cottage, on Great Lime\nRoad. The locomotive could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at 4 mph (6.4 km/h),\nand was the first successful flanged-wheel adhesion locomotive: its traction\ndepended on contact between its flanged wheels and the rail.\n\nAltogether, Stephenson is said to have produced 16 locomotives at\nKillingworth,^[8] although it has not proved possible to produce a convincing\nlist of all 16. Of those identified, most were built for use at Killingworth\nor for the Hetton colliery railway. A six-wheeled locomotive was built for the\nKilmarnock and Troon Railway in 1817 but was withdrawn from service because of\ndamage to the cast-iron rails.^[14] Another locomotive was supplied to Scott's\nPit railroad at Llansamlet, near Swansea, in 1819 but it too was withdrawn,\napparently because it was under-boilered and again caused damage to the\ntrack.^[15]\n\nFishbelly rail with half-lap joint, patented by Stephenson 1816\n\nThe new engines were too heavy to run on wooden rails or plate-way, and iron\nedge rails were in their infancy, with cast iron exhibiting excessive\nbrittleness. Together with William Losh, Stephenson improved the design of\ncast-iron edge rails to reduce breakage; rails were briefly made by Losh,\nWilson and Bell at their Walker ironworks.\n\nAccording to Rolt, Stephenson managed to solve the problem caused by the\nweight of the engine on the primitive rails. He experimented with a steam\nspring (to 'cushion' the weight using steam pressure acting on pistons to\nsupport the locomotive frame), but soon followed the practice of\n'distributing' weight by using a number of wheels or bogies. For the Stockton\nand Darlington Railway Stephenson used wrought-iron malleable rails that he\nhad found satisfactory, notwithstanding the financial loss he suffered by not\nusing his own patented design.^[16]\n\n### Hetton Railway[edit]\n\nStephenson was hired to build the eight-mile (13-km) Hetton colliery railway\nin 1820. He used a combination of gravity on downward inclines and locomotives\nfor level and upward stretches. This, the first railway using no animal power,\nopened in 1822. This line used a gauge of 4 ft 8 in (1,422 mm) which\nStephenson had used before at the Killingworth wagonway.^[17]\n\nOther locomotives include:\n\n  * 1817\u20131824 The Duke for the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway\n\n## The First Railways[edit]\n\n### Stockton and Darlington Railway[edit]\n\nThe No. 1 engine, called Locomotion, for the Stockton & Darlington Railway\n\nIn 1821, a parliamentary bill was passed to allow the building of the Stockton\nand Darlington Railway (S&DR). The 25-mile (40 km) railway connected\ncollieries near Bishop Auckland to the River Tees at Stockton, passing through\nDarlington on the way. The original plan was to use horses to draw coal carts\non metal rails, but after company director Edward Pease met Stephenson, he\nagreed to change the plans. Stephenson surveyed the line in 1821, and assisted\nby his 18-year-old son Robert, construction began the same year.^[8]\n\nExperiment, the first railway carriage\n\nA manufacturer was needed to provide the locomotives for the line. Pease and\nStephenson had jointly established a company in Newcastle to manufacture\nlocomotives. It was set up as Robert Stephenson and Company, and George's son\nRobert was the managing director. A fourth partner was Michael Longridge of\nBedlington Ironworks.^[8] On an early trade card, Robert Stephenson & Co was\ndescribed as \"Engineers, Millwrights & Machinists, Brass & Iron\nFounders\".^[18] In September 1825, the works at Forth Street, Newcastle,\ncompleted the first locomotive for the railway: originally named Active, it\nwas renamed Locomotion and was followed by Hope, Diligence and Black Diamond.\nThe Stockton and Darlington Railway opened on 27 September 1825. Driven by\nStephenson, Locomotion hauled an 80-ton load of coal and flour nine miles (14\nkm) in two hours, reaching a speed of 24 miles per hour (39 kilometres per\nhour) on one stretch. The first purpose-built passenger car, Experiment, was\nattached and carried dignitaries on the opening journey. It was the first time\npassenger traffic had been run on a steam locomotive railway.^[8]\n\nThe rails used for the line were wrought-iron, produced by John Birkinshaw at\nthe Bedlington Ironworks. Wrought-iron rails could be produced in longer\nlengths than cast-iron and were less liable to crack under the weight of heavy\nlocomotives. William Losh of Walker Ironworks thought he had an agreement with\nStephenson to supply cast-iron rails, and Stephenson's decision caused a\npermanent rift between them. The gauge Stephenson chose for the line was 4\nfeet 8+1\u20442 inches (1,435 mm) which subsequently was adopted as the standard\ngauge for railways, not only in Britain, but throughout the world.^[8]\n\n### Liverpool and Manchester Railway[edit]\n\nStatue of George Stephenson at the National Railway Museum, YorkFirst\npassenger railway, L&MR\n\nStephenson had ascertained by experiments at Killingworth that half the power\nof the locomotive was consumed by a gradient as little as 1 in 260.^[19] He\nconcluded that railways should be kept as level as possible. He used this\nknowledge while working on the Bolton and Leigh Railway, and the Liverpool and\nManchester Railway (L&MR), executing a series of difficult cuttings,\nembankments and stone viaducts to level their routes. Defective surveying of\nthe original route of the L&MR caused by hostility from some affected\nlandowners meant Stephenson encountered difficulty during Parliamentary\nscrutiny of the original bill, especially under cross-examination by Edward\nHall Alderson. The bill was rejected and a revised bill for a new alignment\nwas submitted and passed in a subsequent session. The revised alignment\npresented the problem of crossing Chat Moss, an apparently bottomless peat\nbog, which Stephenson overcame by unusual means, effectively floating the line\nacross it.^[8] The method he used was similar to that used by John Metcalf who\nconstructed many miles of road across marshes in the Pennines, laying a\nfoundation of heather and branches, which became bound together by the weight\nof the passing coaches, with a layer of stones on top.\n\nAs the L&MR approached completion in 1829, its directors arranged a\ncompetition to decide who would build its locomotives, and the Rainhill Trials\nwere run in October 1829. Entries could weigh no more than six tons and had to\ntravel along the track for a total distance of 60 miles (97 km). Stephenson's\nentry was Rocket, and its performance in winning the contest made it famous.\nGeorge's son Robert had been working in South America from 1824 to 1827 and\nreturned to run the Forth Street Works while George was in Liverpool\noverseeing the construction of the line. Robert was responsible for the\ndetailed design of Rocket, although he was in constant postal communication\nwith his father, who made many suggestions. One significant innovation,\nsuggested by Henry Booth, treasurer of the L&MR, was the use of a fire-tube\nboiler, invented by French engineer Marc Seguin that gave improved heat\nexchange.^[8]\n\nThe opening ceremony of the L&MR, on 15 September 1830, drew luminaries from\nthe government and industry, including the Prime Minister, the Duke of\nWellington. The day started with a procession of eight trains setting out from\nLiverpool. The parade was led by Northumbrian driven by George Stephenson, and\nincluded Phoenix driven by his son Robert, North Star driven by his brother\nRobert and Rocket driven by assistant engineer Joseph Locke. The day was\nmarred by the death of William Huskisson, the Member of Parliament for\nLiverpool, who was struck by Rocket. Stephenson evacuated the injured\nHuskisson to Eccles with a train, but he died from his injuries. Despite the\ntragedy, the railway was a resounding success. Stephenson became famous, and\nwas offered the position of chief engineer for a wide variety of other\nrailways.^[8]\n\n### Stephenson's skew arch bridge[edit]\n\nStephenson's bridgeA close-up of the technique\n\n1830 also saw the grand opening of the skew bridge in Rainhill over the\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway. The bridge was the first to cross any\nrailway at an angle.^[20] It required the structure to be constructed as two\nflat planes (overlapping in this case by 6 ft (1.8 m)) between which the\nstonework forms a parallelogram shape when viewed from above. It has the\neffect of flattening the arch and the solution is to lay the bricks forming\nthe arch at an angle to the abutments (the piers on which the arches rest).\nThe technique, which results in a spiral effect in the arch masonry, provides\nextra strength in the arch to compensate for the angled abutments.^[21]\n\nThe bridge is still in use at Rainhill station, and carries traffic on the A57\n(Warrington Road). The bridge is a listed structure.\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n### Life at Alton Grange[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

The promoters of the line Mr William\nStenson and Mr John Ellis, had difficulties in raising the necessary capital\nas the majority of local wealth had been invested in canals. Realising the\npotential and need for the rail link Stephenson himself invested \u00a32,500 and\nraised the remaining capital through his network of connections in Liverpool.\nHis son Robert was made chief engineer with the first part of the line opening\nin 1832.\n\nDuring this same period the Snibston estate in Leicestershire came up for\nauction, it lay adjoining the proposed Swannington to Leicester route and was\nbelieved to contain valuable coal reserves. Stephenson realising the financial\npotential of the site, given its proximity to the proposed rail link and the\nfact that the manufacturing town of Leicester was then being supplied coal by\ncanal from Derbyshire, bought the estate.\n\nEmploying a previously used method of mining in the midlands called tubbing to\naccess the deep coal seams, his success could not have been greater.\nStephenson's coal mine delivered the first rail cars of coal into Leicester\ndramatically reducing the price of coal and saving the city some \u00a340,000 per\nannum.\n\nStephenson remained at Alton Grange until 1838 before moving to Tapton House\nin Derbyshire.^[22]^[page needed]\n\n### Later career[edit]\n\nThe next ten years were the busiest of Stephenson's life as he was besieged\nwith requests from railway promoters. Many of the first American railroad\nbuilders came to Newcastle to learn from Stephenson and the first dozen or so\nlocomotives utilised there were purchased from the Stephenson shops.\nStephenson's conservative views on the capabilities of locomotives meant he\nfavoured circuitous routes and civil engineering that were more costly than\nhis successors thought necessary. For example, rather than the West Coast Main\nLine taking the direct route favoured by Joseph Locke over Shap between\nLancaster and Carlisle, Stephenson was in favour of a longer sea-level route\nvia Ulverston and Whitehaven. Locke's route was built.\n\nStephenson tended to be more casual in estimating costs and paperwork in\ngeneral. He worked with Joseph Locke on the Grand Junction Railway with half\nof the line allocated to each man. Stephenson's estimates and organising\nability proved inferior to those of Locke and the board's dissatisfaction led\nto Stephenson's resignation causing a rift between them which was never\nhealed.^[8]\n\nDespite Stephenson's loss of some routes to competitors due to his caution, he\nwas offered more work than he could cope with, and was unable to accept all\nthat was offered. He worked on the North Midland line from Derby to Leeds, the\nYork and North Midland line from Normanton to York, the Manchester and Leeds,\nthe Birmingham and Derby, the Sheffield and Rotherham among many others.^[8]\n\nStephenson became a reassuring name rather than a cutting-edge technical\nadviser.^[citation needed] He was the first president of the Institution of\nMechanical Engineers on its formation in 1847. By this time he had settled\ninto semi-retirement, supervising his mining interests in Derbyshire \u2013\ntunnelling for the North Midland Railway revealed coal seams, and Stephenson\nput money into their exploitation.\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\nGeorge first courted Elizabeth (Betty) Hindmarsh, a farmer's daughter from\nBlack Callerton, whom he met secretly in her orchard. Her father refused\nmarriage because of Stephenson's lowly status as a miner.^[23] George next\npaid attention to Anne Henderson where he lodged with her family, but she\nrejected him and he transferred his attentions to her sister Frances (Fanny),\nwho was nine years his senior. George and Fanny married at Newburn Church on\n28 November 1802. They had two children Robert (1803) and Fanny (1805) but the\nlatter died within months. George's wife died, probably of tuberculosis, the\nyear after. While George was working in Scotland, Robert was brought up by a\nsuccession of neighbours and then by George's unmarried sister Eleanor\n(Nelly), who lived with them in Killingworth on George's return.\n\nOn 29 March 1820, George (now considerably wealthier) married Betty Hindmarsh\nat Newburn. The marriage seems to have been happy, but there were no children\nand Betty died on 3 August 1845.^[24]\n\nOn 11 January 1848,^[25] at St John's Church in Shrewsbury,\nShropshire,^[citation needed] George married for the third time, to Ellen\nGregory, another farmer's daughter originally from Bakewell in Derbyshire, who\nhad been his housekeeper. Seven months after his wedding, George contracted\npleurisy and died, aged 67, at noon on 12 August 1848 at Tapton House in\nChesterfield, Derbyshire. He was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield,\nalongside his second wife.^[8]\n\nDescribed by Rolt as a generous man, Stephenson financially supported the\nwives and families of several who had died in his employment, due to accident\nor misadventure, some within his family, and some not. He was also a keen\ngardener throughout his life; during his last years at Tapton House, he built\nhothouses in the estate gardens, growing exotic fruits and vegetables in a\n'not too friendly' rivalry with Joseph Paxton, head gardener at nearby\nChatsworth House, twice beating the master of the craft.^[citation needed]\n\n#### Descendants[edit]\n\nGeorge Stephenson had two children. His son Robert was born on 16 October\n1803. Robert married Frances Sanderson, daughter of a City of London\nprofessional John Sanderson, on 17 June 1829. Robert died in 1859 having no\nchildren. Robert Stephenson expanded on the work of his father and became a\nmajor railway engineer himself. Abroad, Robert was involved in the\nAlexandria\u2013Cairo railway that later connected with the Suez Canal. George\nStephenson's daughter was born in 1805 but died within weeks of her birth.\nDescendants of the wider Stephenson family continue to live in Wylam\n(Stephenson's birthplace) today. Also relatives connected by his marriage live\nin Derbyshire. Some descendants later emigrated to Perth, Australia, and\nMinnesota, with later generations remaining to this day.\n\nThis Stephenson engineering family is not to be confused with the lighthouse-\nbuilding engineering family of Robert Stevenson, which was active in the same\nera. Note the spelling difference.\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n### Influence[edit]\n\nA Portrait of George Stephenson by painter John Lucas\n\nBritain led the world in the development of railways which acted as a stimulus\nfor the Industrial Revolution by facilitating the transport of raw materials\nand manufactured goods. George Stephenson, with his work on the Stockton and\nDarlington Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, paved the way for\nthe railway engineers who followed, such as his son Robert, his assistant\nJoseph Locke who carried out much work on his own account and Isambard Kingdom\nBrunel. Stephenson was farsighted in realising that the individual lines being\nbuilt would eventually be joined, and would need to have the same gauge. The\nstandard gauge used throughout much of the world is due to him. In 2002,\nStephenson was named in the BBC's television show and list of the 100 Greatest\nBritons following a UK-wide vote, placing at no. 65.^[26]\n\nThe Victorian self-help advocate Samuel Smiles had published his first\nbiography of George Stephenson in 1857, and although attacked as biased in the\nfavour of George at the expense his rivals as well as his son, it was popular\nand 250,000 copies were sold by 1904. The Band of Hope were selling\nbiographies of George in 1859 at a penny a sheet, and at one point there was a\nsuggestion to move George's body to Westminster Abbey.^[27]^[28]^[29] The\ncentenary of George's birth was celebrated in 1881 at Crystal Palace by 15,000\npeople,^[30] and it was George who was featured on the reverse of the Series E\nfive pound note issued by the Bank of England between 1990 and 2003.^[31] The\nStephenson Railway Museum in North Shields is named after George and Robert\nStephenson.^[32]\n\n### Memorials[edit]\n\nStephenson's statue in Chesterfield\n\nGeorge Stephenson's Birthplace is an 18th-century historic house museum in the\nvillage of Wylam, and is operated by the National Trust. Dial Cottage at West\nMoor, his home from 1804, remains but the museum that once operated here is\nshut.^[33]^[34]\n\nChesterfield Museum in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, has a gallery of Stephenson\nmemorabilia, including straight thick glass tubes he invented for growing\nstraight cucumbers. The museum is in the Stephenson Memorial Hall^[35] not far\nfrom both Stephenson's final home at Tapton House and Holy Trinity Church\nwithin which is his vault. In Liverpool, where he lived at 34 Upper Parliament\nStreet, a City of Liverpool Heritage Plaque is situated next to the front\ndoor.\n\nStephenson College, founded in 2001 on the Durham University's Queen's Campus\nin Stockton-on-Tees (relocated to Durham in 2018), is named after him. Also\nnamed after him and his son is George Stephenson High School in Killingworth,\nStephenson Memorial Primary School in Howdon, the Stephenson Railway Museum in\nNorth Shields, the Stephenson Locomotive Society, the Stephenson Centre, an\nSEBD Unit of Beaumont Hill School in Darlington, and the Stephenson Building,\nhome of the school of engineering at Newcastle University.^[36] His last home\nin Tapton, Chesterfield is now part of Chesterfield College and is called\nTapton House Campus.\n\nAs a tribute to his life and works, a bronze statue of Stephenson was unveiled\nat Chesterfield railway station (in the town where Stephenson spent the last\nten years of his life) on 28 October 2005, marking the completion of\nimprovements to the station. At the event a full-size working replica of the\nRocket was on show, which then spent two days on public display at the\nChesterfield Market Festival. A statue of him dressed in classical robes\nstands in Neville Street, Newcastle, facing the buildings that house the\nLiterary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne and the North of\nEngland Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, near Newcastle railway\nstation. The statue was sculpted in 1862 by John Graham Lough and is listed\nGrade II.^[37]\n\nFrom 1990 until 2003, Stephenson's portrait appeared on the reverse of Series\nE \u00a35 notes issued by the Bank of England. Stephenson's face is shown alongside\nan engraving of the Rocket steam engine and the Skerne Bridge on the Stockton\nto Darlington Railway.^[38]\n\nStephenson's profile is carved in the facade of Lisbon's victorian railway\nstation.\n\nNorth-western Milan has the street Via Giorgio Stephenson in his honour.\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\nStephenson was portrayed by actor Gawn Grainger on television in the 1985\nDoctor Who serial The Mark of the Rani.^[39]\n\nHarry Turtledove's alternate history short story \"The Iron Elephant\" depicts a\nrace between a newly invented steam engine and a mammoth-drawn train in 1782.\nA station master called George Stephenson features as a minor character\nalongside an American steam engineer called Richard Trevithick, likely\nindicating that they were analogous rather than historical characters.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Trains portal\n\n  * History of Science and Technology\n  * Industrial Revolution\n  * Train\n  * Robert Stephenson\n  * Robert Stephenson and Company\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ 'Stephenson gauge' was initially of 4 feet 8 inches (1,420 mm) in the North East of England. For the higher speeds of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, this was expanded slightly to 4 feet 8+1\u20442 inches (1,435 mm) between the rails whilst keeping the same spacing between the wheels, making it more free-running. It is unclear how much of this was George Stephenson's initiative and how much was his son Robert's.\n  2. ^ Recent scholarship holds that Stephenson's My Lord of 1814 pre-dated Bl\u00fccher^[13]\n\n  1. ^ \"George Stephenson | Biography, Locomotives, & Facts | Britannica\". 5 June 2023.\n  2. ^ \"Plaque unveiled for 'Father of Railways' George Stephenson\".
