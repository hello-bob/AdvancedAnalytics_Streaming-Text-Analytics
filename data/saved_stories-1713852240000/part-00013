Local\nnaval facilities are paralyzed and crucial U.S. naval assets like the John F.\nKennedy aircraft carrier (CVN-79) are severely damaged.\n\nThis catastrophe prompts urgent decisions about the Navy's footprint in the\nregion and the future of the Gerald R. Ford-class carriers amidst global\ntensions with China.\n\n\u25ce \u25ce \u25ce\n\nHurricane Helen and residual fallout from Covid-19 as well as labor unrest and\neconomic concerns driven by inflation further complicate recovery efforts and\nfuture naval readiness.\n\nDecision-makers face a dilemma: Should they invest heavily in the carrier\nprogram to boost the regional economy and the navy's capabilities, or should\nthey scale back due to fiscal challenges and climate change concerns?\n\n\u25ce \u25ce \u25ce\n\nEveryone wants America to succeed, but each person has their own motivations\nand personal objectives. Can they collectively find a path forward that helps\ntheir interests and the nation\u2019s? It\u2019s Hampton at the Cross-Roads \u2014 and the\nfuture is in your hands.\n\n## Characters\n\nMayor Wallace\n\nCity of Newport News\n\nTaking office in 2020, Wallace has a background that combines engineering\nexpertise from the University of Virginia with global experience from the\nPeace Corps. Focused on the dual challenges of climate change and preserving\nlocal shipbuilding jobs, Wallace used their mayoral campaign to advocate for\nurban resilience. They beat a long-time incumbent in an upset victory.\n\nRepresentative Chase\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee\n\nAfter a multi-decade career in the House of Representatives, Representative\nChase is now chair of the Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee. An easy\npath to reelection is suddenly in doubt in the aftermath of Hurricane Helen,\nplacing Chase in the spotlight like never before. Fighting climate and union\nactivists, Chase must match the economic viability of the region's shipyard\nwith the future needs of the U.S. Navy all with just weeks to spare.\n\nCEO BREWER\n\nGriffith Barrett Industries\n\nA native of Biloxi, MS, Brewer rose up through the ranks of GBI over many\ndecades, finally becoming CEO. Brewer oversees a sprawling range of\nactivities, but most importantly, the company\u2019s shipyard in Hampton Roads,\nwhich is its largest revenue and profit center. With Hurricane Helen's\ndestruction, Brewer needs to carefully handle repairs along with a growing\nlabor crisis to ensure GBI's long-term success on Wall Street.\n\nSubstacker Carmichael\n\nVirginia Stripes Substack\n\nAfter graduating from the College of William & Mary, Carmichael joined the\nDaily Press, the local newspaper of Hampton Roads, reporting on regional\nissues and the last mayoral campaign. Recently, they left to build a new\nSubstack newsletter focused on the defense economy of Hampton Roads. With\nHurricane Helen's landfall, Carmichael is suddenly getting attention for\n\"Virginia Stripes\" like never before, and hopes to parlay that interest into a\ndurable subscription-based media company.\n\nUnion President McKinley\n\nLocal 9999\n\nThe latest in a multi-generational family of welders at the GBI shipyard,\nMcKinley mostly ignored union politics until Covid-19 broke out, where they\nwatched workers pass away even as the company instituted back-to-work orders\nto meet the Navy's construction deadlines. The event radicalized McKinley, who\nwon the recent union presidential election and is now devoted to ensuring that\nGBI's workforce is as safe, healthy and prosperous as the company itself.\n\nAdmiral Reid\n\nU.S. Navy\n\nAs Chief of Naval Operations and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Reid\nis the proud leader of America's naval forces. Reid has sounded the alarm on\nthe Navy\u2019s vulnerabilities to climate change for many years, warnings that\nhave long been dismissed. Now with the extensive damage from Hurricane Helen,\nReid has the opportunity to shine \u2014 and potentially be promoted to Chairman of\nthe Joint Chiefs \u2014 or drown in the coming scapegoating.\n\n## How To Play\n\n01\n\nOfficial Game Kit\n\nDownload all materials required to run this scenario\n\n6\n\ncharacters\n\n4\n\nscenes\n\n3 hours\n\nDifficulty:\n\nMedium\n\nDownload .Zip\n\nGame Scenario and Rules\n\nFull Scenario and Rules Booklet\n\nDownload\n\nScore Calculator (Apple Numbers)\n\nSpreadsheet to calculate game metrics and scores\n\nDownload\n\nScore Calculator (XLSX Export)\n\nSpreadsheet to calculate game metrics and scores\n\nDownload\n\nName Badges\n\nPrint once for each player to wear as a lanyard\n\nDownload\n\nEvent Cards\n\nPrint once and create a deck of random event cards\n\nDownload\n\nPlayer Decision Sheets\n\nPrint one full set and issue them to players during each game scene\n\nDownload\n\nPrivate Character Sheets\n\nPrint one full set and issue them at the beginning of the game\n\nDownload\n\nStarting Handouts\n\nPrint six copies, and offer one copy to each player at the beginning of the\ngame\n\nDownload\n\nPlayer Scene Guides\n\nPrint six copies, and offer a copy of each scene's guide to each player at the\nstart of the scene\n\nDownload\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nOn climate change and national security, this scenario was inspired by details\npresented in Michael Klare\u2019s book All Hell Breaking Loose: The Pentagon\u2019s\nPerspective on Climate Change as well as a special issue of the Journal of\nAdvanced Military Studies on national security and disaster response (Volume\n13, Issue 1).\n\nOn the specific challenges of labor and unionization at America\u2019s naval\nshipyards, this scenario was inspired by Michael Fabey\u2019s book Heavy Metal: The\nHard Days and Nights of the Shipyard Workers Who Build America\u2019s\nSupercarriers.\n\n## Credits\n\nScenario Design and Story: Danny Crichton Producer: Chris Gates Front Cover\nIllustration: Barry Blankenship Production Designer: Justin Barber Website\nDesigner: James Clements Associate: Ken Bui\n\n## Contact us\n\nJoin a future game\n\nriskgaming@luxcapital.com\n\nIntroduce Yourself\n\nPress Inquiries\n\ncomms@luxcapital.com\n\nContact us\n\nSubscribe to the Newsletter\n\nthanks, you're subscribed.\n\nsorry, something went wrong.\n\nListen to the podcast\n\nWe believe before others understand\n\nNew York\n\n920 Broadway 11th Floor New York, NY 10010\n\n[P]\n\n646.475.4385\n\n[F]\n\n646.349.2960\n\nSilicon VAlley\n\n1600 El Camino Real, Ste 290 Menlo Park, CA 94025\n\n[P]\n\n646.475.4385\n\n[F]\n\n646.349.2960\n\nMedia\n\narticles\n\npodcast\n\nEvents\n\nmedia kit\n\n[E]\n\ncomms@luxcapital.com\n\n[E]\n\ninfo@luxcapital.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Lux Capital.
