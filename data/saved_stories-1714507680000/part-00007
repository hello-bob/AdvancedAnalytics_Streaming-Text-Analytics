The widespread threats these leaky systems reveal could also present a\nconcerning new kind of exploit for cyberattacks, whether the device uses a\nChinese-language keyboard, an English keyboard, or any other.\n\nLast year, the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab released a study of a\nproprietary Chinese keyboard system owned by the Shenzhen-based tech giant\nTencent. Citizen Lab\u2019s \u201cSogou Keyboard\u201d report exposed the widespread range of\nattacks possible on the keyboard, which could leak a user\u2019s key presses to\noutside eavesdroppers. Now, in the group\u2019s new study, released last week, the\nsame researchers have discovered that essentially all the world\u2019s popular\nChinese smartphone keyboards have suffered similar vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cWhatever Chinese-language users of your app might have typed into it has been\nexposed for years.\u201d \u2014Jedidiah Crandall, Arizona State University\n\nAnd while the specific bugs the two reports have uncovered have been fixed in\nmost instances, the researchers\u2019 findings\u2014and in particular, their\nrecommendations\u2014point to substantially larger gaps in the systems that extend\ninto software developed around the world, no matter the language.\n\n\u201cAll of these keyboards were also using custom network protocols,\u201d says Mona\nWang, a computer science Ph.D. student at Princeton University and coauthor of\nthe report. \u201cBecause I had studied these sort of custom network protocols\nbefore, then this immediately screamed to me that there was something really\nterrible going on.\u201d\n\nJedidiah Crandall, an associate professor of computing and augmented\nintelligence at Arizona State University in Tempe, who was consulted in the\nreport\u2019s preparation but was not on the research team, says these\nvulnerabilities matter for nearly any coder or development team that releases\ntheir work to the world. \u201cIf you are a developer of a privacy-focused chat app\nor an app for tracking something health related, whatever Chinese language\nusers of your app might have typed into it has been exposed for years,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n### The Chinese keyboard problem\n\nChinese, a language of tens of thousands of characters with some 4,000 or more\nin common use, represents a distinct challenge for keyboard input. A range of\ndifferent keyboard systems have been developed in the digital era\u2014sometimes\ncalled pinyin keyboards, named after a popular romanization system for\nstandard Chinese. Ideally, these creative approaches to digital input enable a\nprofoundly complex language to be straightforwardly phoneticized and\ntransliterated via a compact, often QWERTY-style keyboard format.\n\n\u201cEven competent and well-resourced people get encryption wrong, because it\u2019s\nreally hard to do correctly.\u201d \u2014Mona Wang, Princeton University\n\nComputational and AI smarts can help transform key presses into Chinese\ncharacters on the screen. But Chinese keyboards often involve many\ninterchanges across the Internet between cloud servers and other assistive\nnetworked apps, just to make it possible for a Chinese-speaking person to be\nable to type the characters.\n\nAccording to the report\u2014and an FAQ the researchers released explaining the\ntechnical points in plain language\u2014the Chinese keyboards studied all used\ncharacter-prediction features, which in turn relied on cloud-computing\nresources. The researchers found that improperly secured communications\nbetween a device\u2019s keyboard app and those external cloud servers meant that\nusers\u2019 keystrokes (and therefore their messages) could be accessed in transit.\n\nJeffrey Knockel, a senior research associate at Citizen Lab and the report\ncoauthor, says cloud-based character prediction is a particularly attractive\nfeature for Chinese-language keyboards, given the vast array of possible\ncharacters that any given QWERTY keystroke sequence might be attempting to\nrepresent. \u201cIf you\u2019re typing in English or any language where there\u2019s enough\nkeys on a keyboard for all your letters, that\u2019s already a much simpler task to\ndesign a keyboard around than an ideographic language where you might have\nover 10,000 characters,\u201d he says.\n\nChinese-language keyboards are often \u201cpinyin keyboards,\u201d which allow for\nthousands of characters to be typed using a QWERTY-style\napproach.Zamoeux/Wikimedia\n\nSarah Scheffler, a postdoctoral associate at MIT, expressed concern also about\nother kinds of data vulnerabilities that the Citizen Lab report reveals\u2014beyond\nkeyboards and Chinese-language specific applications necessarily. \u201cThe\nvulnerabilities [identified by the report] are not at all specific to pinyin\nkeyboards,\u201d she says. \u201cIt applies to any application sending data over the\nInternet. Any app sending unencrypted\u2014or badly encrypted\u2014information would\nhave similar issues.\u201d\n\nWang says the chief problem the researchers uncovered concerns the fact that\nso many Chinese-keyboard protocols transmit data using inferior and sometimes\ncustom-made encryption.\n\n\u201cThese encryption protocols are probably developed by very, very competent and\nvery well-resourced people,\u201d Wang says. \u201cBut even competent and well-resourced\npeople get encryption wrong, because it\u2019s really hard to do correctly.\u201d\n\n### Beyond the vulnerabilities exposed\n\nScheffler points to the two-decades-long testing, iteration, and development\nof the transport layer security (TLS) system underlying much of the Internet\u2019s\nsecure communications, including websites that use the Hypertext Transfer\nProtocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol. (The first version of TLS was specified and\nreleased in 1999.) \u201cAll these Chinese Internet companies who are rolling their\nown [cryptography] or using their own encryption algorithms are sort of\nmissing out on all those 20 years of standard encryption development,\u201d Wang\nsays.\n\nCrandall says the report may have also inadvertently highlighted assumptions\nabout security protocols that may not always apply in every corner of the\nglobe. \u201cProtocols like TLS sometimes make assumptions that don\u2019t suit the\nneeds of developers in certain parts of the world,\u201d he says. For instance, he\nadds, custom-made, non-TLS security systems may be more attractive \u201cwhere the\nnetwork delay is high or where people may spend large amounts of time in areas\nwhere the network is not accessible.\u201d\n\nScheffler says the Chinese-language keyboard problem could even represent a\nkind of canary in the coal mine for a range of computer, smartphone, and\nsoftware systems. Because of their reliance on extensive Internet\ncommunications, such systems\u2014while perhaps overlooked or relegated to the\nbackground by developers\u2014also still represent potential cybersecurity attack\nsurfaces.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, a lot of these security failures arise from groups that don\u2019t\nthink they\u2019re doing anything that requires security or don\u2019t have much\nsecurity expertise,\u201d Scheffler says.\n\nScheffler identifies \u201cInternet-based predictive-text keyboards in any\nlanguage, and maybe some of the Internet-based AI features that have crept\ninto apps over the years\u201d as possible places concealing cybersecurity\nvulnerabilities similar to those that the Citizen Lab team discovered in\nChinese-language keyboards. This category could include voice recognition,\nspeech-to-text, text-to-speech, and generative AI tools, she adds.\n\n\u201cSecurity and privacy isn\u2019t many people\u2019s first thought when they\u2019re building\ntheir cool image-editing application,\u201d says Scheffler. \u201dMaybe it shouldn\u2019t be\nthe first thought, but it should definitely be a thought by the time the\napplication makes it to users.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated 29 April 2024.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * World's First Classical Chinese Programming Language \u203a\n  * How Language Shapes Password Security \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Pinyin - Wikipedia \u203a\n\ncybersecuritysmartphoneskeyboardsoftwareartificial intelligence\n\nMargo Anderson\n\nis the news manager at IEEE Spectrum.
