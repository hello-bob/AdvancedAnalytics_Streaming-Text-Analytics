All of them were charged with\nfraud, money laundering, and being part of a criminal organization.\n\n> #OperacionesGC | M\u00e1s de 100 detenidos por toda Espa\u00f1a por estafar casi un mill\u00f3n de \u20ac por el m\u00e9todo del #HijoEnApuros\n>\n> \u25b6\ufe0fLocalizadas m\u00e1s de 500 cuentas bancarias que el grupo criminal utilizaba\n> para recibir el dinero.\n>\n> \u25b6\ufe0fLas transferencias estafadas a cada v\u00edctima iban desde los...\n> pic.twitter.com/skvbEx8KA4\n>\n> \u2014 Guardia Civil (@guardiacivil) April 30, 2024\n\nTo trick their victims, the scammers contacted them on WhatsApp posing as a\nfamily member, typically a son, in some distressing situation requiring urgent\nfinancial help.\n\nMoney transfers from 238 victims ranged from \u20ac800 to \u20ac55,000.\n\nThe scammers were so convincing that in most cases, they managed to get\ncontinuous payments from their victims, according to the police.\n\nLaw enforcement also identified more than 500 bank accounts that the scammers\nused to transfer the money. The fraudsters also registered nearly 100 phone\nnumbers using false identities.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time the hackers used such a scheme to trick Spanish\ncitizens. Earlier in January, local police arrested 59 members of a criminal\ngang that stole over \u20ac460,000 ($490,000) by convincing families that their\nchildren, often students abroad, were in trouble and urgently needed the\nmoney.\n\nAccording to the police, the hackers used social media to find potential\ntargets and collect as much information about them as possible to make the\nconversation seem credible.\n\nThe so-called \u201cfamily-in-need\u201d schemes are common among hackers worldwide. In\nJanuary, the U.S. charged 16 individuals who defrauded elderly Americans out\nof millions of dollars by pretending to be their relatives in urgent need of\nmoney.\n\nOne American family was scammed out of hundreds of dollars earlier in March\nwhen a group of hackers convinced them that their daughter had been abducted\nby Mexican authorities.\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * News\n  * News Briefs\n\nGet more insights with the\n\nRecorded Future\n\nIntelligence Cloud.\n\nLearn more.\n\nTags\n\n  * fraud\n  * scam\n  * Impersonation scams\n  * Spain\n  * arrests\n  * WhatsApp\n\nNo previous article\n\nNo new articles\n\nDaryna Antoniuk\n\nis a reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.
