Here, such an antiviral platform has\nbeen developed based on a mixture of hetero-peptides self-assembled into\nfunctionalized \u03b2-sheets capable of specific multivalent binding to viral\nprotein complexes. One domain of each hetero-peptide is designed to\nspecifically bind to certain viral proteins, while another domain self-\nassembles into fibrils with epitope binding characteristics determined by the\ntypes of peptides and their molar fractions. The self-assembled fibrils\nmaintain enhanced binding to viral protein complexes and retain high\nresilience to viral mutations. This method is experimentally and\ncomputationally tested using short peptides that specifically bind to Spike\nproteins of SARS-CoV-2. This platform is efficacious, inexpensive, and stable\nwith excellent tolerability.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Reverse engineering synthetic antiviral amyloids\n\nArticle Open access 05 June 2020\n\n### gp120-derived amyloidogenic peptides form amyloid fibrils that increase\nHIV-1 infectivity\n\nArticle 05 March 2024\n\n### Multivalent bicyclic peptides are an effective antiviral modality that can\npotently inhibit SARS-CoV-2\n\nArticle Open access 16 June 2023\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn recent decades, many novel viruses originating in the animal kingdom have\nbeen spreading in the rapidly growing human population. Among them, the highly\ncontagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which\ncaused the COVID-19 pandemic, has claimed millions of lives worldwide and\noverwhelmed global healthcare systems for several years^1. During the\ninfection process, the viral \u2018Spike\u2019 protein binds the angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that is expressed ubiquitously in human cells^2,3,4.\nThe mRNA vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2 have proven to be an effective\nstrategy against severe disease and death in infected patients, and whilst\nmore effective against early viral strains; their protection against new viral\nvariants becomes less efficient, unless they are based on new viral strains^5.\n\nRecombinant hACE2 and virus-specific antibodies from convalescent patient\nplasma have been explored as decoys for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, but the risk of\nblood-borne disease, immune rejection, and demand for logistical expertise to\npurify and manufacture biological (blood) products, limits broad availability\nand extends higher costs^6,7. In general, the specificity of antibodies\ntowards target proteins is conferred by the conformations that the complex\nantibody active sites adopt and their surface interactions. Despite their\nlarge sizes, numerous antibodies (convalescent plasma to in situ vaccine-\nderived antibodies) have gradually diminishing activities against viral\nvariants/mutations^8,9.\n\nThe early presence of a high-resolution atomistic structure of SARS-CoV-2\nbound to ACE2 has facilitated the rational design of novel therapeutics^10\ntargeting the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction with host\nACE2^2,3,6,11,12,13,14,15,16. Based on the ACE2-RBD coupling, design\nstrategies that employ the human ACE2 structure (binding motifs) have been\nidentified and proposed as proteins and peptides for therapeutic\ndevelopment^17,18,19,20,21,22. As promising peptide candidates display a lack\nof stability and live virus efficacy, molecular modeling studies were used to\nfind site-specific amino acid mutations to optimize the helical strength,\nmaintain low antigenicity, and have a high affinity for RBD^17,18,23. A\nstrategy to target smaller antigenic determinants with shorter\nproteins/peptides may confer variant specificity, at the cost of specificity\nrestricted to a small binding region. However, self-assembled peptide (SAP)\nconjugates may enhance binding^24,25 to a target through non-covalent\nstabilization by multivalent^25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36\nsupramolecular interactions^37. At the same time, larger self-assembled\nconstructs can form a supramolecular assembly atop multiple RBDs at the viral\nsurface, thereby inhibiting viral proteins from binding to cell receptors.\nThis strategy is premised on studies that have investigated SAP-like peptides\nwith multivalent tailorable antigen presentation^38 in self-adjuvanting\nvaccines^39,40 for upregulated targets in cancer^41,42, and other\npathogens^40,43.\n\nHere, we introduce a tunable and scalable antiviral platform that utilizes the\nspecificity of peptides in their binding to receptors, which is strengthened\nby multivalency introduced through a charged amphiphilic domain that mediates\nthe self-assembly of the peptides. Here, we have designed and tested\nfunctionalized hetero-peptides that can self-assemble into fibers and bind to\nSARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBDs, and perform facile tuning of the peptide sequence and\nsecondary structure composition through rationalized computational design\ndemonstrated for pan-coronavirus targeting. The conjugation of the functional\nSpike-binding peptides (SBP1/2/3) to an SAP domain preserves the in silico RBD\naffinity of the constructs (Fig. 1A\u2013F). Moreover, SAP conjugated peptide\ninhibitors (ESBP1/2/3) were hypothesized to bind viral Spike and self-assemble\natop the viral particles, effectively inhibiting the Spike from binding with\nACE2 (Fig. 1G). Interestingly, the SAP domain alone has non-specific (ionic)\ninteractions with Spike (demonstrated in silico and in vitro), and\nadditionally, significantly, synergize RBD targeting SAP peptides in mixtures\nagainst live virus.\n\nFig. 1: Design strategy of self-assembling peptides (SAPs) as targeted\ninhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nA ACE2 \u03b11 helix (red) complexed on SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD (gray surface, cyan &\npurple backbone) generated from PDB ID: 6M0J^69.

G We\nhypothesize that SBP-functionalized SAP monomers comprise a target domain\nthat: (i) binds Spike of SARS-CoV-2, (ii) self-assembles atop the viral\nparticle, (iii) inhibits virus binding to ACE2, and (iv) coats the virus for\nclearance by the body.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThe published atomistic binding structure of Spike-RBD coupled to ACE2^44\nprovided a means to understand the interaction between the ACE2 \u03b11 helix\ndomain and Spike-RBD, which was mutated to enhance its binding to RBD (Fig.\n1). These mutated peptides demonstrated that a more stable \u03b1-helix that aided\nin binding to RBD, with nM inhibition of SARS-CoV-2^23, akin to other ACE2\ndomain mimicry strategies recently investigated^45,46,47.\n\n### Enhanced binding with self-assembling sequences\n\nInitial attempts in peptide design involved isolation of a short Spike-binding\npeptide (SBP) sequence (IEEQAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQS) from ACE2 \u03b11^17. This short\nsequence, termed SBP1, was the first bioactive domain that was tested. The SAP\ndomains were conjugated to SBP1 with 2 alternatively charged SAP terminal\nresidues, glutamic acid E^24,48 and lysine K^30,31,49 (Fig. 2A). We observed a\nsignificant (~70%) inhibition of pseudovirus by SBP1 from media control (Fig.\n2B), as reported previously^17,18. E-flanked SAP termed E1 (E-SLSLSLSLSLSL-E)\nwas conjugated to SBP1 (ESBP1), which inhibited pseudovirus to a similar\ndegree, while K-flanked SAP termed K1 (K-SLSLSLSLSLSL-K) conjugated to SBP1\n(KSBP1) had a significant decrease in inhibitory effect (Fig. 2B). A secondary\nB.1 lineage live virus plaque formation assay was performed with SBP1 and\nESBP1 to confirm if the self-assembling domain could assist in viral\ninhibition. In the live virus assay, counts of infectious plaques confirmed a\nsignificant improvement in viral inhibition by ESBP1 relative to SBP1 alone\n(Fig. 2C).\n\nFig. 2: Evaluation of Spike-binding peptides and anti-SARS-CoV-2 SAPs.\n\nA Spike-binding proteins (SBP) derived from truncated ACE2 peptidase domain\u2019s\n\u03b11 helix^17.

The bold-\nunderlined residues are essential for Spike binding and conserved in all\nconstructs. B Constructs were screened using a Spike expressing inactivated\npseudovirus luciferase reporting assay to compare the ability of SBP1, ESBP1,\nand KSBP1 (10 \u03bcM) to inhibit viral infection of 293 T cells overexpressing\nACE2. n = 3 samples (KSBP1), n = 3 (control, SBP1) or 5 samples (ESBP1).

Source data are provided in the\nSource Data file.\n\nFull size image\n\nDuring the testing of ESBP1 (2021), a novel Spike-binding domain that had a\nstabilized ACE2-based helix was discovered by Karoyan et al.^23. The sequence\nwas modified to include only canonical amino acids, yielding the bioactive\nsequence SBP2 (SALEEQLKTFLDKFMHELEDLLYQLAL), which had a strong \u03b1-helical\nstructure (Supplementary Fig. 1). Conjugation to the E1 self-assembling domain\nyielded a sequence ESBP2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Notably, SBP2 and ESBP2\nshowed excellent cytocompatibility and inhibition of live virus. ESBP2 safety\nwas evaluated in vivo via 10 days repeat multi-dose IV administration of ~1w%\nESBP2 which showed no adverse effect in 225\u2013250 g adult rats and ~4\u20138 hours\nclearance in acute 24-hour single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation\n(Supplementary Fig. 1). However, the ESBP2 peptide did not form stable\n\u03b2-sheets, as evidenced by an \u03b1-helical signature in CD (Supplementary Fig. 1C)\nand visualized aggregates by AFM (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Notwithstanding,\nthis supports our hypothesis of SAP functionalization of binding domains,\nspecifically demonstrating that SAPs with E termini can enhance Spike binding\nand inhibition (Fig. 2A, B).\n\n### Conformational optimizations of peptides improve fibrillation\n\nDocking of SBP2 to Spike showed a HADDOCK^50,51 score inferior to unmodified\nACE2 \u03b11 helix. Further optimization of SBP2^23 revealed the importance of Tyr\nor homo-Tyr mutations for Leu-7 in their 20\u201330-mer peptides. Bude Alanine\nScanning (BalaS)^52 of the resulting lowest energy pose identified end\nresidues for truncation and central residues for modification. This sequence,\nSBP3 (QYKTYIDKNNHYAEDERYK, Fig. 3A, B), showed improved Spike binding in\nsilico (Fig. 3C). We noted that the smaller size of this sequence may allow\nless steric hindrance in self-assembled structures. Circular dichroism of E1\nconjugated SBP3 (ESBP3, Fig. 3A, B) showed predominant \u03b2-sheet conformation.\nESBP3 showed the formation of fibrils in AFM (Supplementary Fig. 2) and\nnegatively stained TEM (Fig. 3E), which appear to form aggregates radially on\nthe Spike RBD (Fig. 3F). ESBP3 further demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition\nof live virus.\n\nFig. 3: Development of Spike-binding sequence.\n\nA Sequence comparison of SBP1 and SBP2 to yield a truncated and optimized SBP3\nand ESBP3.

G The ability\nof live SARS-CoV-2 virus to infect non-human primate (Vero) cells in the\npresence of ESBP3 in a dose-dependent fashion (mean infectious plaque counts,\nnormalized to \u2018no peptide\u2019 control; source data are provided as a Source Data\nfile). n = 6 samples (0.001, 0.01, 1, and 10 \u03bcM) or 13 samples (0.1 \u03bcM\ncondition). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. One-way ANOVA (df = 2,\nF-statistic = 12.1, p = 0.00000421; Tukey Honestly Significant Difference\n(HSD) post-hoc test for multiple comparisons). Source data are provided in the\nSource Data file.\n\nFull size image\n\nThermal signatures from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) supported\nspontaneous self-assembly of ESBP3 monomers and ESBP3-Spike-binding events\n(Supplementary Fig. 2). ESBP3 showed excellent stability in lyophilized form\nas well as in formulation at a variety of temperatures over 12 weeks\n(Supplementary Fig. 2). Like ESBP2, ESBP3 showed excellent cytocompatibility\nwith human alveolar epithelial A549 cells and dose-dependent antiviral\ninhibition with a calculated IC_50 of 2.5 \u03bcM (Supplementary Fig. 1, Fig. 3G).\nESBP3 showed rapid clearance from the circulation (<4 hours) after IV bolus\nadministration\u2014characteristic of IV (peptide) therapeutics (Supplementary Fig.\n2). Daily repeated IV dosing for 10 days showed no adverse effect in rodents.\nSubcutaneously implanted boluses in rats and repeated daily intranasal (IN)\ndosing in mice showed no significant body weight changes or adverse organ\nmorphology (Supplementary Fig. 2). These 2 routes represented safety for\npotential instillation routes for prophylaxis in the nasal passageways and\npotential treatment IV. These biocompatibility results support safety but may\nwarrant future studies that probe interactions of peptides and their\nmaintained efficacy when in contact with mucosal/plasma fluids.\n\n### Examination of the self-assembled \u03b2-sheets\n\nTo better understand the structure of these mimics, various self-assembled\npeptide structures were analyzed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.\nFirst, we examined whether parallel or antiparallel orientations take part\nbetween E1 self-assembled in \u03b2-sheet planes. The calculated MM-GBSA free\nenergies (see Methods for details) of binding between E1 and its surrounding\n\u03b2-sheet plane showed that E1 preferentially assembles into an antiparallel\n\u03b2-sheet. The calculated free energies were \u0394G = \u221288.45 kcal/mol, \u221273.37\nkcal/mol, and \u2212108.10 kcal/mol for all parallel, planar antiparallel, and all\nantiparallel, respectively (Fig. 4A\u2013C). This suggests a preponderance towards\nfully antiparallel self-assembly, but not exclusively antiparallel\narrangement; statistical distributions of peptide configurations within the\nself-assembled fibrils are controlled by their free energies. The MD\nsimulations revealed variable non-periodic twists within the fibrils,\nanalogous to variable twist rates observed within an E1 fiber during Cryo-EM\nimage collection. This variability in twist limited our ability to resolve the\ncryo-EM model at adequate resolution, but it did allow us to observe spacing\nbetween the monomers and an approximate multimeric structure similar to our\nmodels (Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nFig. 4: Self-assembly of E1 and ESBP3 SAP.\n\nMD simulations were performed to predict E1 fibril preponderance towards A all\nparallel, B planar antiparallel, and C all antiparallel \u03b2-sheets. MM-GBSA free\nenergy of coupling between parallel fibers and antiparallel fibers indicates a\nmore favorable assembly in antiparallel fashion. Combinations of D 1:7\nESBP3:E1, E 1:3 ESBP3:E1, F and all ESBP3 were simulated in \u03b2-sheet assemblies\nfor 400 ns to assess the relationship between multidomain peptide\nconcentration and interference between the bioactive domains. Accessible\nsurface area (ASA) calculations of the MD trajectories indicate an inversely\nproportional relationship between multidomain peptide concentration and ASA. G\nSolid-state NMR spectra (1H-13C CPMAS, natural isotopic abundance peptide at\n10 mg/mL) of ultracentrifuge pellets of E1 and 3:1 E1:ESBP3 assemblies.

Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. One-way ANOVA (df = 3,\nF-statistic = 25.5, p = 0.0000104; Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)\npost-hoc test for multiple comparisons). Source data are provided in the\nSource Data file.\n\nFull size image\n\nMotivated by the improved structure of ESBP3 by site-specific mutations, we\ninvestigated, by MD simulations, the predicted reduction in steric hindrance\nby incorporating just the self-assembling domain E1 into ESBP3 fibers. We\ngenerated models of 16-mer fibers containing a 7:1 molar ratio and a 3:1 molar\nratio of E1 and ESBP3, and pure ESBP3 (Fig. 4D\u2013F). The E1 fibers containing no\nbioactive domain were hypothesized to serve as a spacer molecule for the\nmultidomain ESBP3 fibers. Accessible Surface Area (ASA) measurements showed an\ninverse relationship between the ESBP3 molar proportion and the area of mimic\naccessible. This agrees with the calculated average ASA of 2761 \u00c5^2/mimic for\n7:1 E1:ESBP3, 2614 \u00c5^2/mimic for 3:1 E1:ESBP3, and 2319 \u00c5^2/mimic for all\nESBP3 (Fig. 4D\u2013F). This warranted further testing through solid-state NMR\ninteractions and, ultimately, live virus inhibition.\n\nWhen the E1, ESBP3, and E1:ESBP3 in a 3:1 molar ratio assembly were examined\nwith NMR, we observed centrifuge pellets and concomitant solid-state NMR\nsignals from the samples of E1 and 3:1 E1:ESBP3. This indicates their assembly\nform organized secondary structures typical for a peptide nanofiber assembly,\nvs ESBP3 (no pellet/no solid-state NMR signal). Comparing the spectra\ncollected for the E1 and 3:1 E1:ESBP3 assemblies, both exhibited peaks with\nlinewidths of ~2 ppm, some overlapping peaks, and some peaks that are unique\nto the 3:1 E1:ESBP3 sample (Fig. 4G). The linewidths were typical for ^13C\nnatural abundance spectra collected for amyloid fibrils of designer\npeptides^53. While natural abundance ^13C NMR is typically insufficient to\nperform spectral assignments (correspondence between NMR peaks and ^13C\nsites), partial ^13C peak assignments were possible because known ^13C\nchemical shift ranges for E, S, and L residues within the E-(SL)_6-E self-\nassembling domain in both peptides^54. Many peaks observed in the E1 spectrum\nalign with the peaks from 3:1 E1:ESBP3, as could be anticipated since both\npeptides assemble into \u03b2-sheets, and the E1 peptide is the most abundant\npeptide in both samples (Fig. 4G). The strongest signal was at 28 ppm,\nindicating that the presence of the ESBP3 peptide affects the assembled\nnanofiber structure, consistent with the SBP3 peptide domain associated with\n25% of molecules in the 3:1 E1:ESBP3 sample (Fig. 4G). The signals indicate\nthat the SBP3 domain was incorporated into the assembly, but also suggest that\na portion of the residues in the SBP3 domain may be integrated into the\n\u03b2-sheet assembly.\n\nGiven the lacking solid-state NMR signal indicating the assembly of ESBP3\npeptide relative to the E1:ESBP3 mixture, we sought to probe soluble monomeric\nand oligomeric peptide assemblies using solution NMR. To this end, 1D ^1H\nsolution NMR spectra of 1 mg/mL solutions of E1, ESBP3, and 3:1 E1:ESBP3\nmixtures were acquired and compared (Fig. 4H). ESBP3 peptide exhibited a\nstrong solution NMR signal (Fig. 4H), in stark contrast to its undetectable\nsolid-state NMR signal (Fig. 4G). E1 peptide and 3:1 E1:ESBP3 mixtures exhibit\nvery weak solution NMR signal (Fig. 4H) and corroborating solid-state NMR\nsignals suggesting these peptides form nanofiber structures (Fig. 4G).\nNotably, the E1 peptide and 3:1 E1:ESBP3 mixtures do exhibit some signal in\nsolution NMR experiments, albeit a different spectral profile from isolated\nESBP3 peptide. Several NMR peaks in solution NMR spectra of ESBP3 exhibit\nnarrow linewidths (<0.1 ppm full-width half maximum) consistent with\nunassembled, free peptide monomers in aqueous solution. Broad NMR peaks with\nwider linewidths (~0.2 ppm) were also present in the ESBP3 solution NMR\nspectra, indicating the presence of soluble, oligomeric, peptide assemblies\n(Fig. 4H)\u2014these fibrillar structures were further visualized in cryo-EM (Fig.\n4I). To determine whether the broad NMR peaks correspond to soluble peptide\nassemblies, we performed 1D ^1H Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) solution NMR\nexperiments^55, which utilize optimized pulses to filter out NMR signals\ncorresponding to larger molecules with unique relaxation properties\n(specifically, small T_2 relaxation values for oligomers with large molecular\nweights)^56. The ^1H CPMG experiments indeed illustrated the presence of both\nsoluble, oligomeric assemblies and monomeric peptides of ESBP3, as shown by\nthe loss of NMR signal corresponding to broad NMR peaks and the relatively\nunaffected NMR signal of the narrow NMR peaks as a function of the CPMG\nrelaxation filter (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\nTaken together, solid- and solution-state NMR indicate that the SBP3 domain\ncan be incorporated into a self-assembled nanostructure formed by the E1\ndomain. For the ESBP3 peptide solution, which contains E1 and SBP3 in every\npeptide molecule, the SBP3 interferes with E1 assembly, resulting in soluble\naggregates that can be detected by solution NMR, but did not pellet via\nultracentrifugation. The solid-state NMR data showed that ESBP3 was\nincorporated into a nanostructure that could be pelleted when ESBP3 was co-\nassembled with E1 in the 3:1 E1:ESBP3 sample (Fig. 4G, H). A comparison of the\nspectrum from 3:1 E1:ESBP3 to the spectrum of an E1 assembly indicates that\nSBP3 affects the assembled structure, but further research is necessary to pin\ndown the structural details. Thus, despite a degree of efficacy we suggest\nthat there may be room for improvement in the self-assembling peptide design.\nESBP3 is limited in its ability to form \u03b2-sheets and fibrils alone (Figs. 3E,\n4I), but it is stabilized into a fiber by doping with E1.\n\n### Live virus inhibition with self-assembled peptide mimics\n\nLive virus plaque inhibition assays against the B.1 strain were performed on\nE1, SBP3, ESBP3, and E1:ESBP3 in a 3:1 molar combination to determine their\ntherapeutic efficacy. While no major differences were determined between E1,\nSBP3, and ESBP3, the 3:1 molar combination of E1 and ESBP3 had significantly\nhigher viral inhibition (Fig. 4J). This enhanced viral inhibition in diluted\nfibrils could have several possible origins, such as specificity to live\nvirus/ Spike by targeting RBD (of ESBP3/ E1:ESBP3) or non-specific ionic\ninteractions of poly-anionic E1. However, spacing of ESBP3 domains with just\nE1 SAP domains, as suggested by NMR, promoted better presentation of the\nbinding domain to RBD.\n\nTo understand these experimental inhibition observations, we performed MD\nsimulations of individual peptides and their assemblies coupled to RBDs in the\nAlpha (B.1.1.7) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants. Starting with the individual\npeptides binding to the Alpha receptor, the E1 domain moved away from the\ncanonical binding pocket (Fig. 5A). SBP3 migrated around the binding pocket,\nwhile rotating and translating away from the traditional residues associated\nwith binding to ACE2 (Fig. 5B), but ESBP3 showed more efficient with a limited\nmigration from the canonical binding pocket (Fig. 5C). ESBP3 also demonstrated\nhigher coupling energy with an average of \u221269.9 kcal/mol, vs. \u221238.9 kcal/mol\nand \u221238.4 kcal/mol for SBP3 and E1 respectively. For the Omicron RBD, E1\nlocalized around the positively charged RBD (Fig. 5D, Supplementary Figure 5)\nwith a similar coupling energy of \u221232.0 kcal/mol. SBP3 showed a decreased\ncoupling energy against Omicron vs. Alpha (Fig. 5E) at \u221236.3 kcal/mol, but\nESBP3 again showed improved binding relative to E1 and SBP3 at \u221295.5 kcal/mol\n(Fig. 5F). MD simulations against a widespread variant (B.1.529) suggested\nESBP3 and E1 would have improved binding against the receptor-binding motif\n(RBM), likely due to the increased positive electrostatic surface potential\nlocalized on the Omicron RBD (Fig. 5E\u2013G, Supplementary Movies. 1-3)^57. This\ndata supports the hypothesis that combining the SBP3 Spike-Binding Peptide\nwith the E1 SAP can enhance its binding to the receptor (Fig. 2, Fig. 5A\u2013F,\nSupplementary Fig. 5).\n\nFig. 5: Evaluation of monomer and multimer binding on variants.\n\nMD simulations of the peptide monomers (A\u2013F) and multimeric fibers (G\u2013L). The\npeptides are represented in green and red, while the Spike RBD protein is\nrepresented in gray with a cyan backbone. The Spike RBM (residues\nSER438\u2192TYR508 SER440\u2192TYR505 for Omicron^69,95) is represented with a purple\nbackbone. MD simulations of binding the E1 self-assembling domain against\nCOVID Variant B.1.1.7 (A) showing limited specificity against the RBM compared\nwith SBP3 (B) and ESBP3 (C). Conversely, E1 remained in the binding pocket\nagainst the B.1.1.529 variant, likely as a result of the higher concentration\nof positive surface charge in the binding pocket of the B.1.1.529 variant (D).\nSBP3 bound the B.1.1.529 variant more effectively than the original variant\n(E), but ESBP3 showed improved binding to the Omicron variant (F). To evaluate\nhow the targeting domain of ESBP3 is affected by the presence of other ESBP3\nmonomers in the fiber, we performed MD simulations of 1:7 ESBP3:E1 against the\nAlpha variant (G), 1:3 ESBP3:E1 against the Alpha variant (H), all ESBP3\nagainst the Alpha variant (I), 1:7 ESBP3:E1 against the Omicron variant (J),\n1:3 ESBP3:E1 against the Omicron variant (K), and all ESBP3 against the\nOmicron variant (L). We observed a relationship between the concentration of\nESBP3 and multivalency and self-interference between the bioactive domains of\nthe monomers. As the concentrations of ESBP3 increase, there are increasing\nclashes and self-ligation between the bioactive domains of ESBP3 monomers (K),\ndisorder in the \u03b2-sheet (I, L), and non-specific interactions with the\nreceptor (I, L).\n\nFull size image\n\nWe simulated fibrils with the 7:1 E1:ESBP3 molar ratio 16-mer, the 3:1\nE1:ESBP3 molar ratio, and all ESBP3 combinations coupled to the Alpha and\nOmicron variants. For Alpha variant, we saw average coupling energies\nincreased with increasing relative ESBP3 concentration, with values of \u221241.5\nkcal/mol, \u221250.4 kcal/mol, and \u221261.4 kcal/mol for 7:1 E1:ESBP3, 3:1 E1:ESBP3,\nand all ESBP3 respectively. For the Omicron variant, there was a less\npronounced difference in energy, with values of \u221288.8 kcal/mol, \u221254.2\nkcal/mol, and \u221270.9 kcal/mol for 7:1 E1:ESBP3, 3:1 E1:ESBP3, and all ESBP3,\nrespectively (Fig. 5H, I, K, L, Supplementary Figure 6, Supplementary Movies\n1\u20133). While the 7:1 E1:ESBP3 showed selective binding to the canonical binding\npocket (Fig. 5G, J, Supplementary Movie 3), as the molar ratio of ESBP3\nincreased, the selectivity of binding started to decrease at full occupancy of\nthe bioactive domains (Fig. 5H, K, Supplementary Movies 1\u20133).\n\nCoupling energy of the whole fibril alone did not explain our live virus\nobservations that spacing the multidomain peptides would yield a more\neffective antiviral (Fig. 5G\u2013L, Supplementary Figure 6). At full occupancy of\nthe fibril by the bioactive domains, various other coupling regions bound to\nRBDs (Fig. 5I, L, Supplementary Movies 3). Overall, our MD simulations of\nfibrils with different ratios of E1:ESBP3 showed that as the proportion of\nESBP3 increases, ASA decreases, leading to disordered presentation of the\nbioactive domains^58 (Figs. 4E, F and 5G\u2013L). This, along with our live virus\ndata (Fig. 4J), suggests a hypothesized optimization^59,60,61 for future\nhybrid constructs by appropriate combinations of pure self-assembling peptide\nand multidomain peptide monomers is warranted as evidenced by the\nsignificantly enhanced binding and live virus inhibition by E1:ESBP3.\n\nWe introduced tunable and scalable antiviral therapeutics based on suitable\npeptide domains conjugated to short peptides capable of self-assembling into\nfunctionalized \u03b2-fibrils. When such hetero-peptides, based on mutated ACE-\u03b11,\nare self-assembled at different relative concentrations, they allow\nmultivalent binding to Spikes of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. EM imaging\nsuggests the aggregation of fibers atop viral particles, depending on the\nE1:ESBP3 relative molarities. Interestingly, E1 alone showed broad antiviral\npotential principally due to its net charge interactions with viral protein\ncoats, as reported for several similar poly-anionic scaffolds for SARS-CoV-2\ntreatment^62,63,64. Simulations of these dynamical therapeutics revealed that\ninter-peptide coupling within the self-assembled antivirals might reduce the\nstrength of multivalent binding to the viral receptors. This work provides a\nversatile platform with the potential to generate highly targeted and\ninexpensive drugs readily amenable to conventional drug fill-and-finish\nprocesses, which can be useful for large-scale production of this class of\nmedicines.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Evaluation of SBP1 and SBP2\n\nSBP1 sequence (IEEQAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQS) was derived from the interacting\nregions of ACE2 by Pomplun et al.^17 SBP2 sequence\n(SALEEQLKTFLDKFMHELEDLLYQLAL) was derived by Karoyan et al.^23. The SWISS-\nMODEL Expasy web server^65,66,67,68 was used to create structural models of\npeptides presented in prior literature and which were mutated from ACE2 \u03b11\nhelix residues 19\u201345 using homology-based modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-RBD\ncomplex PDB ID: 6M0J)^69. We used the HADDOCK 2.4 web server for molecular\ndocking runs between each peptide and Spike RBD using default docking\nparameters, and six complexes from the cluster were selected based on\npredicted energy of interaction for further analysis and comparison to the\nACE2-RBD complex^51,70. A predicted binding energy and dissociation constant\n(K_D) were generated under standard conditions for each complex using the\nPRODIGY web server (https://bianca.science.uu.nl/prodigy/)^71, and Gibbs Free\nEnergy values were predicted using the BalaS BUDE Alanine Scanning web server\n(https://pragmaticproteindesign.bio.ed.ac.uk/balas/)^52. The latter web server\nalso provided insights into the effect of a synonymous mutation at each amino\nacid (R\u2192Ala) in the peptides on binding, enabling the identification of\ncrucial residues that made a significant contribution based on their\ndifferential Gibbs Free Energy (\u0394\u0394G) values. Residues with a \u0394\u0394G higher than\n0.718 kcal/mol were considered most impactful, and residues with a \u0394\u0394G higher\nthan 0.239 kcal/mol were considered essential^72.\n\n### Development of SBP3\n\nThe overall design strategy was guided by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD bound ACE2\ncomplex (PDB ID: 6M17 and 6M0J)^10,73. SBP3 (QYKTYIDKNNHYAEDERYK) was\ndeveloped by comparing the BAlaS BUDE outputs for SBP1 and SBP2 peptides. The\nresidues that had large, positive \u0394\u0394G values were scrutinized and considered\nfor the development of the novel constructs. A new peptide sequence was\ncreated from a combination of these significant residues, which included\nresidues conserved from the original ACE2 \u03b11 helix and residues from the\ntested peptides. Two amino acids had comparable \u0394\u0394G values at three positions\nin the peptide (10, 15, and 17), necessitating the creation of 2^3 = 8 variant\nsequences.\n\nEach sequence was validated using the protocol outlined in the \u201cEvaluation of\nSBP1 and SBP2\u201d section above. Secondary analysis was performed using the\nBeAtMuSiC v1.0 web server (http://babylone.ulb.ac.be/beatmusic/)^74. In\naddition to assessing the effects of an R\u2192Ala mutation, the BeAtMuSiC web\nserver assesses the effects of every possible synonymous mutation at each\namino acid residue. The \u0394\u0394G values obtained from this analysis were used to\ncreate a variant peptide, but this peptide performed poorly in the evaluation\nand thus omitted from this work^75.\n\n### Development of ESBP1, KSBP1, ESBP2, and ESBP3\n\nThe self-assembled analogs were developed by conjugating the SBP mimics (SBP1,\nSBP2, SBP3) into previously published sequences E1 (ESLSLSLSLSLSLE)^24,48 or\nK1 (KSLSLSLSLSLSLK)^28,76 using a glycine spacer. The existing self-assembling\npeptide K-(SL)_6-K or E-(SL)_6-E backbone was conjugated to an SBP mimic with\na glycine spacer yielding X-(SL)_6-X-SBPy\u2014where X is E or K and y is SBP1/2/3,\nonto which a peptide could be added at the C-terminus. All peptides were\ndissolved in pharmaceutical-grade saline (0.9% NaCl).\n\n### Generation of receptor-binding domains of \u03b1 and \u03bf variants\n\nSpike receptor-binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 variants (alpha, \u03b1, GISAID\nAccess ID: EPI_ISL_674612hCoV-19/England/MILK-B8DE60/2020; omicron, GISAID\nAccess ID: EPI_ISL_6795848hCoV-19/South Africa/CERI-KRISP-K032367/2021 \u03bf) were\nmodeled using SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive)^65 by\nproviding the variant sequence of the whole Spike trimer and using the top\nSWISS-MODEL generated structure (assessed with GMQE score) as the homology\ntemplate. The trimer structure was further truncated to amino acids 333 to 526\nto create the RBD. The original RBD on the peptide-RBD complex was carefully\nreplaced with variant RBDs after alignment. The peptide sequences were\ngenerated using the fab command for amino acids on Pymol. The peptide-RBD\ncomplexes were relaxed on Rosetta with a flexible peptide backbone for\nreadjustment on the new complexes^77. Successful complex alignments and\nrelaxations were verified with a record of binding energies on BUDE Alanine\nScanning^52.\n\n### Generation of the multimers for fiber analysis\n\nThe multimeric fibers were generated on Pymol by arranging the fibers 5 \u00c5\napart in the fiber-long dimension. The E1 fibers were arranged to face\nparallel or antiparallel. The ESBP3 fibers were placed antiparallel,\nconsistent with the hypothesized assembly for multidomain nanofibers. E1:ESBP3\nfibers were assembled in a 3:1 E1:ESBP3 molar ratio. All fibers for MD\nanalysis were 16-mer in length and underwent a flexible backbone relax\nprotocol in Rosetta prior to simulation^77.\n\n### Molecular dynamics simulations\n\nAtomistic MD simulations were performed using NAMD3^78,79 with the CHARMM36\nprotein force field and TIP3P water^80. The simulations were performed in a\nphysiological solution with 0.15 M NaCl. The cutoffs of van der Waals (vdW)\nand Coulombic coupling were 10 \u00c5. The particle mesh Ewald (PME)^81 method was\nused for the evaluation of long-range Coulombic interactions and to increase\nthe efficiency of the simulations. The simulations were performed in the NPT\nensemble (P = 1 bar and T = 310 K). The systems were simulated for 400 ns\nusing the Langevin dynamics with a damping constant of 1 ps^\u22121 and a time step\nof 2 fs, and repeated 3 times to ensure consistency for initial configuration-\ndependent structures (Figs. 5H, I, K, L, SI Figs. 6G, H). The monomer on\nreceptor simulations and the 1\u20137 ESBP3-E1 complexes (low local SBP3 density)\nwere simulated for 800 ns to ensure sufficient sampling of the energy space.\n\nThe trajectories were assessed for energy vs. time to determine areas of a\nlocalized flat energy minima for analysis, the details of which are present on\nSI Figs. 5 and 6. These MM-GBSA energies were calculated from 360\u2013400 ns for\nthe E1 fibers (Fig. 4A\u2013C). The 3 \u00c5 ASA was calculated from 360\u2013400 ns for the\nE1-ESBP3 combinations.\n\nThe Coulombic and van der Waals contributions to the coupling energies of\ninteracting residues in different molecules were calculated by the NAMD energy\nplugin. The electrostatic contributions were obtained from,\n\n$${U}_{{elec}}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j >\ni}^{n}\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r\n}\\frac{{q}_{i}{q}_{j}}{{{{{{\\rm{|}}}}}}{\\vec{r}}_{i}-{\\vec{r}}_{j}{{{{{\\rm{|}}}}}}}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q_i and q_j are charges in the molecules, \\\\({\\vec{r}}_{i}\\\\) and\n\\\\({\\vec{r}}_{j}\\\\) their respective positions, and \u03b5_0 is the permittivity of\nvacuum and \u03b5_r is the dielectric constant of water.\n\nThe van der Waals and close-distance atomic repulsion contributions were\ncalculated from the Lennard-Jones (LJ) 6\u201312 potential energy,\n\n$${U}_{{LJ}}=\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{j >\ni}^{n}{\\varepsilon }_{{ij}}\\left[{\\left(\\frac{{\\sigma\n}_{{ij}}}{{r}_{{ij}}}\\right)}^{12}-{\\left(\\frac{{\\sigma\n}_{{ij}}}{{r}_{{ij}}}\\right)}^{6}\\right]$$\n\n(2)\n\nHere, \u03b5_ij is the maximum stabilization energy between ith and jth atoms,\nwhere \u03c3_ij is the distance between the atoms at the minimum potential energy,\nand r_ij is the actual distance between the two atoms. Lorentz\u2013Berthelot rules\nwere used to calculate the LJ parameters between different atom types^47.\nMolecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM-GBSA)\ncalculations have been performed to find the free energies of binding between\nthe self-assembling domains^82,83,84. Separate MM-GBSA calculations were done\nfor three components: a self-assembling monomer, a self-assembled 16-mer fiber\nwith one monomer subtracted, and the whole complex. The approximate free\nenergies of binding for the studied complexes were calculated as\n\n$${\\Delta\nG}_{{MMGB}-{SA}}={G}_{{TOT}(E1-{fiber})}-{G}_{{TOT}\\left(E1\\right)}-{G}_{{TOT}\\left({fiber}\\right)}$$\n\n(3)\n\nWhere the MM-GBSA free energy for each of these molecules or their complexes\nwere calculated from,\n\n$${G}_{{TOT}}={E}_{{MM}}-{G}_{{solv}-p}-{G}_{{solv}-{np}}-{TS}$$\n\n(4)\n\nHere, \\\\({E}_{{MM}}\\\\) are the internal molecular energy, \\\\({G}_{{solv}-p}\\\\)\nis the polar contribution and \\\\({G}_{{solv}-{np}}\\\\) is the non-polar\ncontribution to the molecular solvation energy, and \\\\(TS\\\\) is the entropic\ncontribution to the free energy. NAMD3 was used to calculate the first 3 terms\nof \\\\({G}_{{TOT}}\\\\) in implicit solvent with a dielectric constant of water\nof \\\\(\\varepsilon_r\\\\) = 78.4. The \\\\({E}_{{MM}}\\\\) term is calculated by\nsumming electrostatic energy, van der Waals energy, and internal energy (bond,\nangle, and torsional energy contributions). The \\\\({G}_{{solv}-p}\\\\) term is\nobtained by using the generalized Born (GB) model whereas the\n\\\\({G}_{{solv}-{np}}\\\\) term for each system configuration was calculated\nusing a solvent-ASA, which was evaluated along the entire simulation\ntrajectory, where a radius of 1.4 \u00c5 was used of the mimetic regions using a\nsurface tension of \u03b3 = 0.00542 kcal mol^\u22121 \u00c5^\u22122. The TS term was neglected,\nsince the entropic contribution differences nearly cancel out when we consider\nprotein\u2013protein binding interactions^85,86.\n\n### Solid-phase peptide synthesis\n\nPeptides were prepared on a LibertyBlue solid phase peptide synthesizer (CEM,\nMatthews, NC) using standard Fmoc chemistry, (1:4:4:6 resin:amino\nacid:1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5- b] pyridinium\n3-oxid hexafluorophosphate:diisopropylamine, 0.1 mM scale) and all peptides\nwere N-terminally acetylated (achieved with a 1:3 ratio of acetic anhydride to\ndiisopropylethylamine in dichloromethane) and C-terminally amidated (low\nloading Rink amide resin, 0.36 mmol/gram). After synthesis, the crude peptides\nwere cleaved with 0.25 mL each of MilliQ water, triisopropylsilane, and\n3,6-dioxa-1,8-octanedithiol (DoDT), and 9.25 mL trifluoroacetic acid for 30\nmin at 37 \u00b0C^32,33. Post cleavage, the crude peptides were filtered with a\nfritted column and triturated with cold ether. The ether and peptide mixtures\nwere vortexed and centrifuged, the ether was then decanted, and the crude\npeptides were left to dry overnight. The following day, the crude peptides\nwere dissolved at ~1 mg/mL in MilliQ water (pH ~7.0). These peptide solutions\nwere dialyzed (Spectra/Por S/P 7 RC dialysis tubing, 2 kDa MWCO) against\ndeionized water for 3 days (water changed 3\u00d7 daily, 1:1000 peptide to\nreservoir volume). The peptides were then frozen and lyophilized to obtain the\nfinal peptides. The expected molecular weights of the peptides were confirmed\nwith LC/MS. Peptides were reconstituted at room temperature at 10 mg/mL (or\nstated molarities) in saline with dissolution in <1 minute, and stored at 4 C\ntill used^49,76,87. Mixtures of peptides were formulated at equimolar (or\nstated) concentrations by mixing solubilized formulations, brief vortexing,\nand sonication prior to use.\n\n### LC/MS and stability testing\n\nChromatographic analyses were performed on an analytical high-pressure liquid\nchromatography system (HPLC) with MassLynx software (Version 4.1). Runs were\ncarried out on a Zorbax C3 column (5 \u03bcm, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm) with a 1.0 mL/min\nflow rate. The mobile phase A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in MilliQ water\nand mobile phase B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Gradients\nstarted with mobile phase A at 75% and ran at a 1% ramp to 65% mobile phase B.\nSamples were diluted using 3:7 ACN:MilliQ water to a concentration of 1.0\nmg/mL and then passed through a 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filter before injecting 30 \u03bcL\nof the sample. The column and autosampler were maintained at 40 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C,\nrespectively. A Waters 2487 UV detector monitored 215 nm, and mass spectra\nwere collected from 50 to 3000 AMU. The capillary voltage was 3.00 kV, cone\nvoltage was 30.00 V, extractor voltage was 3.00 V, RF lens voltage was 0.1 V,\nsource temperature was 100 \u00b0C, cone gas flow was 50.0 L/h, and desolvation gas\nflow was 500 L/h^30,88 for the electrospray source.\n\nFor stability testing, ESBP3 was incubated both as lyophilized powders (~5 mg\nper vial) and in formulation (~100 \u03bcL /vial) at \u221220 \u00b0C (lyophilized only), 4\n\u00b0C, 25 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C for 12 weeks. The stability of peptide samples was then\nmeasured using HPLC^87.\n\n### Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)\n\nFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy experiments were performed on a\nPerkinElmer IR 100 spectrophotometer (MA, USA) in attenuated total reflectance\nmode. Samples were prepared with a concentration of 0.1\u20130.01 mg/mL in saline.\nA saline background was obtained for each reading, and sample spectra were\ncollected between 400 and 4000 cm^\u22121. The spectral region of 1400\u20131700 cm^\u22121\nwas displayed to highlight the amide I and amide II regions^28,76.\n\n### Circular dichroism (CD)\n\nTo determine peptide secondary structure, circular dichroism (CD) experiments\nwere performed using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Oklahoma City, OK,\nUSA). The peptide (s) were dissolved at 0.1 to 0.01 mg/mL in saline, and 400\n\u03bcl of the sample was pipetted into a 10 mm cuvette at room temperature. Data\nwas recorded from 190 to 260 nm^24,28,48,76.\n\n### Mechanical testing (rheometry)\n\nThe thixotropic nature of the hydrogel was evaluated with a Texas Instruments\n(ARES G2) oscillatory rheometer. The hydrogel was prepared at 1w%, or 10 mg/mL\nin 1\u00d7 PBS, and 40 \u03bcL was pipetted in between the rheometer bottom plate and an\n8 mm geometry. A shear viscosity test was performed, plotting shear rate (1/s)\nand viscosity (1/Pa) on the x and y axis, respectively^89.\n\n### Atomic force microscopy\n\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) characterized fibrillation of \u03b2-sheet-forming\npeptides. Samples (10 mg/mL) were prepared first in saline, then diluted with\nMilliQ water to 1 and 0.1 mg/mL and pipetted onto freshly cleaved mica.\nPeptide solutions were pipetted 3\u00d7 (10 \u03bcL aliquots) onto a rapidly spinning\ncentrifugal disk to evenly spread the peptide solution. All samples were\nimaged in ScanAsyst mode (Bruker Dimension Icon instrument, AZ, USA) with\nsharpened silicon (0.2\u20130.8 N/m, Al reflective coating) AFM tips^30,48,76,88.\n\n### Scanning electron microscopy\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterized the supramolecular structure\nof formulations. Carbon tape was used to adhere lyophilized peptide and then\nsputter coated with Au/Pd (8 nm thickness, EMS 150 TES sputter coater, Quorum,\nEast Sussex, UK) and imaged with a JSM-7900 (Jeol, Peabody, MA) scanning\nelectron microscope (5.0 kV accelerating voltage, 10 mm working\ndistance)^30,48,76,88.\n\n### Transmission electron microscopy\n\nNegative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using\nstandard procedures. Briefly, Holey carbon-coated, glow-discharged 400-mesh\nelectron microscopy grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) were\nloaded with (i) ESBP3 only (10 \u03bcM), and (ii) ESBP3 pre-incubated with viral\nRBD (10:1), stained with 1% (v/v) ammonium molybdate (in H_2O, pH ~5, 2\nminutes), washed with water and air-dried before being imaged on a JEOL 2200FS\n(200 kV) electron microscope.\n\n### ITC\n\nCalorimetric experiments of binding between (i) ESBP3 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike-\nRBD, and (ii) self-assembly of ESBP3 peptide only were carried out using\nMicroCal Auto-iTC_200 instrument (GE Healthcare). ESBP3 and RBD were suspended\nin the ITC buffer (1\u00d7 PBS). RBD (5 \u03bcM in the sample cell) was titrated against\nESBP3 (100 \u03bcM in the syringe), and ESBP3 (1 mM in the sample cell) was\ntitrated against ESBP3 (4 mM in the syringe) with a constant stirring speed of\n907 rpm. 20 injection titrations were carried out at room temperature. The\nreference power and injection volumes were kept 10 \u03bccal/sec and 2 \u03bcL,\nrespectively. The experiments were reproduced to confirm the findings. Each\ntitration was fitted into a one-site binding model by using the Origin\nsoftware provided with the instrument.\n\n### Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy\n\nTo experimentally validate E1:ESBP3 peptide mixtures, solid-state NMR\nexperiments were pursued. ^13C solid-state NMR measurements were conducted\nusing cross-polarization magic angle spinning (^1H-^13C CPMAS) to evaluate\nsample structural order and structural differences between samples. The\npeptides were not isotopically enriched, so the ^13C signal was from the 1%\nnatural abundance for ^13C. Furthermore, signals detected via CPMAS\nmeasurements resulting from the rigid regions of the self-assembly (the core\namyloid structure\u2014owing to E1), as dynamic solvent-accessible regions are not\nexpected to exhibit measurable cross-polarization effects^90.\n\nAfter peptide dissolution at 10 mg/mL, the samples were concentrated by\nultracentrifugation for 30 minutes in Bruker 3.22 mm NMR rotors at 4 \u00b0C and\n150,000 RCF in Ultra-clear tubes of SW-41 Ti swinging bucket rotor fitted onto\na Beckman Optima XPN-100 centrifuge. A 11.75 T magnet Bruker Avance III HD 500\nspectrometer (500 MHz, ^1H NMR Larmor frequency) equipped with a room\ntemperature 3.2 mm Bruker Low-E ^1H/^13C/^15N NMR probe was used for\nmeasurements. ^13C chemical shift referencing was conducted using adamantane\nreferenced to tetramethylsilane. 1D ^13C cross-polarization magic angle\nspinning (CPMAS) spectra were collected using the standard Bruker cp pulse\nsequence. A 10 kHz magic angle spinning speed was used for all samples. The\nchannels frequency for the optimization of the Hartmann-Hahn condition for ^1H\nand ^13C are 500.133 MHz and 125.771 MHz, respectively. A recycle delay time\nof 4 seconds (d1) and dwell time of 5 \u03bcs (DW) were used. Acquisition time was\nset to 10.24 ms. Signals were averaged over ~12 hours at room temperature.\nData were processed using TopSpin v3.6.2, and custom code developed using\nWolfram Mathematica 13.\n\n### Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy\n\nPeptide samples were dissolved in 99.9% deuterium oxide (D_2O) at a\nconcentration of 1 mg/mL prior to solution NMR measurements recorded at 25 \u00b0C\non an 11.75 T Bruker Avance III HD 500 spectrometer (500 MHz, ^1H NMR Larmor\nfrequency) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled Prodigy cryoprobe. 1D ^1H\nsolution NMR spectra were collected using standard Bruker pulse sequence\nzgesgp for solvent suppression using excitation sculpting with number of scans\nset to 100, recycle delay set to 2 seconds (d1), acquisition time set to 3.28\nseconds, and dwell time set to 100 \u03bcs (DW). For 1D ^1H Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-\nGill (CPMG) solution NMR experiments were collected using standard Bruker\npulse sequence cpmg_esgp2d with a number of scans set to 64, recycle delay set\nto 5 seconds (d1), dwell time set to 62 seconds (DW), acquisition time set to\n1.02 seconds, CPMG time (d31) set to 0.002 seconds, and vclist values of 5,\n25, 50, and 800 (corresponding to shorter to longer CPMG/T_2 relaxation filter\nvalues). Measurements were conducted at room temperature. Data were processed\nusing TopSpin v3.5 and visualized in Wolfram Mathematica 13.\n\n### Cytocompatibility\n\nCytocompatibility of the peptides was evaluated at 1, 0.1, and 0.01 mM with\nA549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) cultured in complete media consisting of 90% F-12K\nand 10% FBS. The A549 cells were utilized after their first passage and seeded\nat 10,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate for 24 hours. The conditions were\nprepared in serum-free A549 media and introduced into the wells for 6 hours,\nafter which the condition media were aspirated, the wells were washed once\nwith PBS, and 10 \u03bcL of CCK8 was added to 100 \u03bcL of PBS^32. The plate was\nincubated for 1 hour and read on a Tecan M200 Infinite plate reader at an\nabsorbance of 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm. The results were\nanalyzed and normalized to the serum-free media control^28,32,76.\n\n### In vitro efficacy testing of peptides against SARS-CoV-2 Spike\npseudoviruses\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped viruses were prepared using HIV-1 plasmid\nwith luciferase reporter, pNL4-3-Luc, and pcDNA3.1(+) containing SARS-CoV-2\nSpike gene (Wuhan-Hu-1 (Acc. No. QHD43416)) as described^91. The plasmids were\nco-transfected into HEK-293T (ATCC CRL-1573) cells using LipofectamineTM 3000\nTransfection Reagent (Cat. No. L3000001). The transfected cells were\nsupplemented with serum-free DMEM, and the serum-free spent media of\ntransfected cells containing pseudovirus were harvested at 48 hours post-\ntransfection. The virus was centrifuged at 600 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes at 4 \u00b0C to\nremove the cell debris filtered through 0.4 \u03bcm filter, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C\nfor further use.\n\nFor the titration of pseudoviruses, HEK-293T-ACE2 cells were seeded at 5 \u00d7\n10^4 cells/well onto the 48-well cell culture plate. At 18\u201324 hours of\nseeding, the supernatant was removed, and cells were infected with 100 \u03bcL of\npseudovirus at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour, and then the infected cells were replenished\nwith 400 \u03bcL of DMEM containing 10% FBS. At 72 hours post-infection, the media\nwere removed, and 60 \u03bcL of luciferase lysis buffer was added to the cells and\nincubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then 40 \u03bcL of lysate was\ntransferred to Microlite 2+ flat bottom white-well luminescence plate, and 25\n\u03bcL of luciferase reagent was added to the lysate, and luminescence (RLU) was\nmeasured immediately.\n\nHEK-293T-ACE2 cells were seeded in the 48-well plate. Next day, 500 \u03bcL of\nserum-free SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudoviruses with known infectivity (RLUs) were\nincubated with 0.01 \u03bcM, 0.1 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM peptides at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour while\nkeeping untreated pseudovirus control. Then pseudovirus/peptide complex or\npseudovirus at 100 \u03bcL were added to the HEK-293T-ACE2 cells and incubated at\n37 \u00b0C for 1 hour and replenished with 400 \u03bcL of DMEM supplemented with 10%\nFBS. At 72 hours post-infection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase was\nmeasured. The RLUs for virus control and peptide treatments were plotted\nagainst the concentrations of each peptide. The pseudovirus entry was\nquantitated as the luciferase expression in the infected cells.\n\n### In vitro efficacy testing of peptides against SARS-CoV-2\n\nPropagation and titration of SARS-CoV-2 was performed as we described\npreviously^92. Briefly, Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) cell monolayer was infected\nwith SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of ~0.1, briefly, the spent media (DMEM containing 10%\nFBS) from Vero E6 monolayer was decanted and washed with PBS (pH ~7.2). The\nmonolayer was infected at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour and then replenished with DMEM\ncontaining 2% FBS. The cell culture supernatant containing the virus was\nharvested at 72 hours post infection. The virus aliquots were stored at \u221280\n\u00b0C^92.\n\nVirus infectivity was quantitated by plaque assay using Vero E6 cells, in\nbrief, 4 \u00d7 10^5 Vero cells/well were seeded on the six-well plate using DMEM\ncontaining 10% FBS. After 18\u201324 hours the cells were washed with PBS (pH ~7.2)\nand infected using 400 \u03bcL of 10-fold dilutions of virus at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour.\nThen the virus inoculum was removed and 4 mL/well of agarose-DMEM overlay (50\nmL of overlay contains 25 mL 1.6% agarose and 25 mL 2\u00d7 DMEM with 8% FBS) was\nadded to the wells. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO_2 for 3\ndays. The cells were fixed with 10% buffered formalin, agar plugs were\nremoved, stained with 0.2% crystal violet (in 20% ethanol), and plaques were\ncounted^92.\n\nAbout 30\u201340 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 in serum-free DMEM were\nincubated with the peptides at 0.01 \u03bcM, 0.1 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM peptides for 1\nhour at 37 \u00b0C (untreated virus control was maintained in each plate). Then,\nthe Vero E6 cell monolayer was washed with PBS and incubated with virus-\npeptide complex or virus and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour. The inoculum was\nremoved and 4 mL agarose-DMEM overlay was added to each well. The plates were\nincubated for 3 days at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO_2. The plates were fixed with 10%\nbuffered formalin, agar plugs were removed, stained with 0.2% crystal violet\n(in 20% ethanol), and plaques were counted^93. IC_50 was calculated using a\nfour-parameter logistic regression model (Quest GraphTM CC50 Calculator, AAT\nBioquest (https://www.aatbio.com/tools/ic50-calculator))^94.\n\n### In vivo assays\n\nAll animals were treated in accordance with NJIT-Rutgers Newark Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) policies and AALAC, and AWA guidelines.\nHousing conditions for the mice/rats, have 12 hr dark/light cycle, ambient\ntemperature, and humidity. All animals were purchased from Charles River\nLaboratories and housed at local facilities for a minimum of 1 week before\nstudies were commenced.\n\n### Biocompatibility\u2014rodent sub-Q analysis\n\nThe peptide hydrogel was prepared at 10 mg/mL in sterile saline and aspirated\nin sterile 1 mL syringes, with careful attention to avoid air bubbles. Female\nWistar rats (225\u2013250 g, 8\u201312 weeks old) were used for dorsal subcutaneous\nimplantation. The rats were anesthetized using 2.5% isoflurane and 2% oxygen,\nafter which the back of the rat\u2019s hair was shaved and sterilized with 3\nalternating applications of isopropanol and betadine. 200 \u03bcL boluses of the\npeptide hydrogel were injected with a 25 G needle at n = 4 for a time point of\n7 days. After the time point, the animals were sacrificed, and the implant\nregions were collected and fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin. The\nRutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey histology core processed the paraffin-\nembedded samples for histological evaluation after staining with hematoxylin\nand eosin and Masson\u2019s Trichrome. Samples were also fixed in glutaraldehyde\nand formaldehyde, processed to eponate blocks, and sectioned with an\nultramicrotome for electron microscopy imaging (above)^30,76,87.\n\n### Trafficking\u2014rodent IV repeat dose and PK analysis\n\nFemale Wistar rats (225\u2013250 g, 8\u201312 weeks old) were observed and acclimatized\nfor 2 weeks prior to running the studies. They were housed in a controlled\nenvironment with temperature at ~37 \u00b0C and 40\u201370% humidity. They were kept in\nan alternating 12-hour light/dark cycle, and food, and water was provided as\npellets ad libitum. Female Wistar Rats were used for the pharmacokinetics and\nthe drug clearance analysis from the blood. The two hydrogels (ESBP2 and\nESBP3) at 10 mg/ml concentration were injected into the rats via the lateral\ntail vein. For subcutaneous implants, the substance was injected between the\nshoulder blades and above the lumbar vertebrae, 200 \u03bcL each, using a 25-gauge\nneedle. The hydrogel bolus was prepared with 0.9% saline and was injected\nwithin 1\u20132 minutes. The volume injected was approximately 1% of the total body\nweight of the rat, which was calculated prior to the dosing. The initial blood\ndraw was performed for baseline, and the subsequent blood collection was\nperformed from the lateral vein using 25 g butterfly needles.\n\n### Acute PK\n\nRat blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 15, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and\n24 hours post-injection timepoints for Acute PK and were aliquoted out into\nheparinized tubes to prevent coagulation and stored on top of ice packs. Blood\ncollected in K2EDTA anticoagulant tubes was processed to plasma frozen via\ncentrifugation at 13000 RCF for 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0C and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C till\nanalysis using HPLC. The body weight was recorded every day prior to the blood\ncollection.\n\n### Chronic PK\n\nFemale Wistar rats (225\u2013250 g, 8\u201312 weeks old) were weighed and repeatedly\ndosed (1% by weight) IV with ESBP2 or ESBP3 daily at 10 mg/mL (~3 mM). Rat\nblood samples were collected daily prior to injection via tail vein. Post 10\ndays of treatment, animals were allowed to recover for 10 days and then\nsacrificed. Plasma was stored and analyzed as above. The body weight was\nrecorded every day prior to the blood collection.\n\n### Tolerability\u2014rodent IN repeat dose\n\nFemale C57BL/6 mice (15\u201320 g, 8\u201312 weeks old) were used for intranasal dosing\nof the peptide. As mentioned previously, 25 \u03bcl of hydrogels were injected into\neach of the nasal cavities twice daily at an interval of 8 hours for 10 days\nconsecutively. The organs were harvested at the final time point, and\nsectioning was performed for histological evaluation. The plasma was also\ncollected for quantifying peptide clearance in the bloodstream of the animal\nmodel.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study are\navailable within the paper and its Supplementary Information files.
