Aside from Alma Linux 9.4 still supporting some aging hardware\nthat the official RHEL 9.4 drops, what's new is largely the same in them both.\nThat is the main point of the RHELatives, after all.\n\nRHEL 9 appeared two years ago and what Red Hat really wants you to do is\nupgrade to that. If you are still running RHEL 7, which is now approaching a\ndecade old, there's good news. Red Hat is offering four more years of support\nfor RHEL 7.9, which it terms Extended Life Cycle Support or ELS.\n\nIf you are running the free version, CentOS Linux 7, that hits its end-of-life\non the same date: June 30, 2024. CIQ, which offers CentOS Linux rebuild Rocky\nLinux, has a life cycle extension for that too, which it calls CIQ Bridge. The\ncompany told The Reg:\n\nCIQ Bridge, essentially a long-term support service tailored for CentOS 7\nusers on the migration path to Rocky Linux, is offered under an annual, fixed-\nrate subscription. CIQ Bridge includes access to CentOS 7 extended life\npackage updates for an additional three years and security updates for CVSS 7\nissues and above. Security updates for CVSS 5 and 6 are available at an\nelevated subscription tier. CIQ Bridge is designed to support CentOS 7 users\nuntil they are ready for CIQ guidance and support in migration to Rocky Linux.\n\nCIQ believes there's a substantial market for this, and points to research\nfrom Enlyft that suggests hundreds of thousands of users still on CentOS Linux\n7.\n\n### Executive summary\n\nIf you are a RHEL 7 customer, you can pay the Big Purple Hat some more money\nand keep getting updates for another four years \u2013 and of course the company\nwill be happy to help you migrate to a newer paid version.\n\nIf you're using the freebie CentOS 7, you can pay CIQ some money instead, and\nkeep getting updates for another three years, while you migrate to Rocky\nLinux.\n\n### Meanwhile, over in the land of Alma Linux...\n\nThe AlmaLinux project has yet to throw a hat into this particular ring, but it\ndoes have documentation on how to migrate from CentOS 7 to AlmaLinux 8.\n\nAs we reported a couple of years ago, remarkably enough, over in Red Hat\ncountry, doing version-to-version upgrades is not a given, as it is for users\nof most other distribution families. For Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE, and openSUSE\nusers, this kind of thing is relatively routine. This is why the Alma Linux\nfolks developed their ELevate tool for simplifying version-to-version in-place\nupgrades.\n\nIn the meantime, AlmaLinux announced that it is establishing a Special\nInterest Group (SIG) for High-Performance Computing. This is about running\nLinux on supercomputers.\n\n  * Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 40, EndeavourOS, and TrueNAS 24.04 all arrive at once\n  * AlmaLinux 9.4 beta prepares to tread where RHEL dares not\n  * Linux kernel 4.14 gets a life extension, thanks to OpenELA\n  * Top five reasons to move from CentOS to RHEL (according to Red Hat)\n\nThis tends to mean relatively loosely coupled clusters [PDF]: many thousands\nof separate Linux boxes, to which you can automatically push out software \u2013\nfor example, with something like Spack \u2013 and then automatically split your\ndata into lots of chunks, and farm those chunks out to all the machines in the\ncluster, for instance with Slurm.\n\nThe biggest clusters are tracked in a list called the Top500 and this is the\nsort of tech that Reg sister site The Next Platform tracks.\n\nThis kind of computing is a key interest of the enterprise players: Red Hat\nhas HPC offerings, there's a special edition of SUSE, and of course Canonical\nis there too. Licensing a paid-for Linux for five and six-figure numbers of\nnodes can obviously get very expensive fast, so this is an area of opportunity\nfor free distros.\n\nBut why now? Well, since doing the same sort of numerical computation and\ntransforms on large blocks of data is what modern GPU hardware is made for,\nthis is a key sales area for GPU vendors. As big players bin their blockchain\nefforts and back away from NFTs, what are they to do with all those racks full\nof GPUs? Luckily they are also perfect for running large language model bots,\nthe inaccurately named \"AI\" of which everyone is now suddenly so fond. If your\npesky liveware has proved fond of working from home and doesn't want to return\nto the unpleasantly expensive office buildings you rent, why not jettison the\nhumans and replace them with server farms full of LLM bots? \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * CentOS\n  * Linux\n  * Red Hat\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * CentOS\n  * Linux\n  * Red Hat\n  * RHEL\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Debian\n  * Fedora\n  * GNOME\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenShift\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Operating System\n\n#### More about\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n#### More about\n\n  * CentOS\n  * Linux\n  * Red Hat\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * CentOS\n  * Linux\n  * Red Hat\n  * RHEL\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Debian\n  * Fedora\n  * GNOME\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenShift\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Operating System\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### AlmaLinux 9.4 beta prepares to tread where RHEL dares not\n\nCIQ also has an alternative approach to compatible kernels with RockyLinux\n\nOSes16 days | 6\n\n#### Fedora 40 is just around the corner with more spins and flavors than ever\n\nKDE edition has the most conspicuous changes, and could become future flagship\n\nOSes11 days | 4\n\n#### Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 40, EndeavourOS, and TrueNAS 24.04 all arrive at\nonce\n\nFOSS round-up Sometimes Linux releases are like buses... frequently clustered\ntogether, and rarely as reliable as you might ideally want\n\nOSes5 days | 15\n\n#### Boosting throughput for cloud databases\n\nAiven's bold move to scale up services for Redis users\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Miracle-WM tiling window manager for Mir hits 0.2.0\n\nWhat are Mir and Wayland all about anyway?\n\nSoftware10 days | 14\n\n#### IBM to acquire Hashi for $6.4B, hopes it will boost software biz and Red\nHat\n\nInvestors want to know what Big Blue is smoking after growth disappoints\n\nOff-Prem9 days | 22\n\n#### Lightweight LXQt 2.0.0 updates to same toolkit as KDE Plasma 6\n\n4-letter survivor's move to Qt 6 means that, love it or hate it, Wayland is\nlooming\n\nOSes13 days | 18\n\n#### Debian spices up APT package manager with a dash of color, squishes\nancient bug\n\n2.9 gives a taste of what's to come\n\nOSes16 days | 39\n\n#### Gentoo Linux tells AI-generated code contributions to fork off\n\nA good PR move opines community member\n\nOSes17 days | 21\n\n#### Torvalds intentionally complicates his use of indentation in Linux\nKconfig\n\nParamount penguin forces more robust whitespace handling\n\nOSes17 days | 90\n\n#### GCC 15 dropping IA64 support is final nail in the coffin for Itanium\narchitecture\n\nUpdated Linux kernel cut it loose, now leading FOSS compiler lands depth-\ncharge on Itanic\n\nApplications22 days | 81\n\n#### German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n'Complete digital sovereignty' ... sounds familiar\n\nSoftware29 days | 195\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
