In a series of videos, titled\nClimate Science Translated, scientists are paired up with various comedians\nwho express climate science in down-to-earth language that pulls no punches.\n\nIn one of the videos, Prof Mark Maslin, of University College London,\nexplains: \u201cThe climate crisis is progressing faster much faster than\nanticipated.\u201d This is translated by the comedian Jo Brand as: \u201cWe\u2019re still\ngoing to hell, but we\u2019re getting there faster.\u201d\n\nMaslin says: \u201cSolar and wind power are now over 10 times cheaper than oil and\ngas. We can still prevent much of the damage and end up in a better place for\neveryone.\u201d Brand responds: \u201cWith wind and sun power we save money and don\u2019t\ndie. It\u2019s a pretty strong selling point.\u201d\n\nAs climate scientists are largely anonymous to the public, it is hoped that\nwith the help of comedians they can get their message out more widely. So far,\nthe video with Brand has been viewed more than 3m times, received mainstream\nattention and has been retweeted by a number of celebrities.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Weatherwatch\n  * Comedy\n  * Jo Brand\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
