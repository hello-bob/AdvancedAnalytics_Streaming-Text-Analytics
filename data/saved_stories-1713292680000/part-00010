When registering for Cerebral\u2019s services, clients\nare required to submit a range of personal data, including residential\naddresses, email addresses, birth dates, medical histories, medication\ndetails, account information, driver\u2019s license numbers, treatment plans,\npharmacy selections, health insurance details, religious beliefs, and sexual\norientation.\n\nThe FTC, the U.S. regulatory authority, has indicated that despite Cerebral\u2019s\nassurances of data security, the company actually shared this information with\nvarious external parties for marketing objectives. Although the privacy\npolicy, which was difficult to comprehend, contained warnings about this data\nsharing, Cerebral frequently asserted that it would not use customer data for\nmarketing without obtaining consent.\n\nData belonging to approximately 3.2 million clients was transmitted to\nLinkedIn, Snapchat, and TikTok through tracking pixels and other software\ntools on Cerebral\u2019s websites and apps. These tracking mechanisms allowed these\nthird parties to access a wide array of Cerebral client data, including names,\nmedical histories, medication details, addresses, email addresses, phone\nnumbers, birth dates, demographic data, IP addresses, pharmacy and health\ninsurance details, and other health-related information.\n\nAdditionally, the FTC criticized Cerebral for its \u201cirresponsible marketing\u201d\npractices. Notably, the company mailed postcards to over six thousand clients\nthat were not enclosed in envelopes, displaying the recipients\u2019 names and\nlanguage indicative of their health conditions, potentially revealing their\ndiagnoses and treatments to any observer.\n\nThe agency also highlighted that Cerebral failed to limit access to client\ndata only to those employees who needed it; former employees continued to have\naccess to sensitive files, and the company lacked proper training and\nprocedures for handling sensitive information. Cerebral also fell short of\nmaintaining proper information security protocols, policies, and procedures\nand used unsafe methods for accessing data, leading to incidents where clients\nlogging into the portal simultaneously could view each other\u2019s information.\n\nCerebral has reached a settlement with the FTC, agreeing to pay $7.1 million.\nUnder the terms of the settlement, the company is required to cease using\nclients\u2019 personal and health information for advertising, gain consent for\ndata sharing, be transparent about its security and privacy practices,\nestablish a comprehensive privacy and security program, and eliminate any\nclient data not needed for treatment or billing.\n\nThe FTC has also initiated legal action against the CEO of Cerebral, Kyle\nRobertson, who opted not to settle; this issue is now pending judicial review.\n\nbyAlex Ivanovs\n\nUpdated April 16, 2024\n\n## Read more\n\n### The Best Web Browsers for Privacy and Security\n\n### Top 5 Tools to Scan for Open Ports and Secure Your Network\n\n### 8 Best Software for Password Cracking\n\n### 8 Best Tools for Cryptography and Encryption\n\n### The data of 760,000 Discord.io users was put up for sale on the darknet\n\n### The 10 Best Password Managers for Businesses\n\n  * About\n  * Advertise\n  * Disclosure\n  * Write for Us\n  * Contact\n\n\u00a9 2024 Stack Diary.
