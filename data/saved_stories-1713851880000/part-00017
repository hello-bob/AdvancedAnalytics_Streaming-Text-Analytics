The Military Health System (MHS) is at an inflection point,\nreflecting risks and challenges that are both unique to military medicine, and\nreflect overall health care challenges in the United States (e.g., increased\nutilization of high-cost services; shortages of nurses, technicians, and\nphysicians; rapid and costly changes in technology; access challenges for\nindividuals living in remote and medically underserved communities).\n\nThe MHS cannot sustain the readiness of the medical force in the present\noperating model. The accelerating shift in healthcare to digitalization,\npatient-centeredness and hyper-specialization requires the Defense Health\nAgency (DHA) to adapt or see a reduced readiness of the medical force,\ndeteriorating retention of medical staff, and reductions in direct care\ncapability and capacity that will be almost impossible to reverse.\n\nPriorities. A new model for delivering care and a technology-enabled framework\nfor adapting and evolving is required. The new model and framework will center\non several priorities that take advantage of available and emerging\ntechnologies and allow new technologies to be added within the military\nhealthcare ecosystem. These priorities are:\n\n\u25cf Human centered. The MHS is woefully behind the patient-centered technology\nofferings of most large health plans and healthcare delivery systems. Tools\nare needed that allow its 9.5 million beneficiaries to better manage their own\nhealth and wellness requirements. The desired solution is a \u201cdigital front\ndoor\u201d that successfully integrates with or replaces our current architecture,\nis data centric and platform agnostic, and is capable of rapid adaptation. The\nexpectation is for beneficiaries to self-schedule with virtual, asynchronous,\nand in person visit options; use secure messaging; participate in patient\nintake; utilize satisfaction surveys; seek referrals; engage with live chats;\nfind providers; and access patient education, medical records and lab results.\n\n\u25cf A Competitive Health Ecosystem. Technologies that military health workers\nhave access to must match or exceed what civilian health workers enjoy today.\nA competitive Health Ecosystem removes administrative, cognitive, and\nrepetitive burdens from the workforce. The initial focus is on the outpatient\nsetting and begins with primary care and behavioral health. Proceeding from an\noutpatient to inpatient setting, the health ecosystem will adapt currently\navailable solutions.\n\nDHA will prioritize its investment strategy to deliver the capabilities the\nDoD needs today and in the near future; rapidly partnering with leaders in\nhealthcare technology and services; incorporating TRICARE contractors and\nnetwork providers in solutions; and better using commercial tools available\nnow to improve both patient and provider experiences.\n\nDesired Capabilities. DHA seeks commercial, platform agnostic solutions to\nsupport a patient experience that is frictionless for its beneficiaries;\nensure patient interactions and data are collected in the MHS Information\nPortal (MIP); enable enterprise-managed multipurpose mobile devices, provider\napplications, digital assistants, and wearables that serve as the foundation\nto grow future initiatives; anticipate advances in the health sciences\n(precision medicine, pharmacovigilance, bio-surveillance).\n\nDHA is seeking to continue to expand its suite of tools based on private\nsector advancements that assist in the transformation of patient care. The\nfocus will be organized across three lines of effort (LOEs).\n\n\u25cf (LOE) 1: Patient Experience \u2013 Changing the Care Model for Healthcare. DHA\nseeks a commercial solution(s) that enables the following priorities:\nfrictionless access to care and services for beneficiaries; seamless\nintegration with the existing Electronic Health Record; and complete\ninteroperability with wearables and devices.\n\nA frictionless experience means that patients can securely access the full\nsuite of health services with a single-sign-on, facilitated by machine\nlearning and chatbots, that provides a longitudinal health record (medical\nhistory, medications, test results, reminders), connects patients to wellness\nand self-care packages, and/or assists patients in virtual, in-person or\nasynchronous visits within the Direct Care System or Private Sector Care. User\ninterfaces are designed for mobile devices (phones, tablets, augmented/virtual\nreality), intuitive and require minimal customer support.\n\nInteroperability includes compatibility with enterprise or personally owned\nperipherals, wearables or medical devices.\n\nSuccessful commercial solutions that focus on changing the care model will\nalso offer access to recognized academic or thought leaders in healthcare\nsystems, healthcare economics, health services research, wellbeing, public\nhealth and life sciences. Changing the value equations requires moving from a\ntransactional, systems-based model to human centered model while maintaining\nquality and safety and retaining fiscal responsibility. The new model will\nplace the business and mechanical aspects of healthcare in the background,\nwhile recentering on MHS patients as human beings and returning joy to the MHS\nworkforce, reminding them why they entered healthcare in the first place.\n\n\u25cf LOE 2: Provider Supported Technology in the Health Ecosystem. This effort\nwill remove administrative, cognitive, and repetitive burdens from the\nworkforce. The Health Ecosystem includes provider applications such as digital\nassistants that use generative AI to recognize speech and assist with\nworkflows.\n\nOver time, the Health Ecosystem will include applications for scheduling,\nvirtual nursing, preventing alert fatigue, chart search, telemetry, remote\npatient monitoring and hospital command centers.\n\n\u25cf LOE 3: Data Management Support - Foundation for Future Initiatives. This LOE\nis based on the intelligent and actionable use of data contained in the MHS\nInformation Portal (MIP). The MIP consists of a logic layer (API Gateway, Data\nExchange, File Transfer) that supports MOVEi, FHIR, JSON and HL7. The data\nlayer (common data model, enterprise data, warehouse, structured data storage\nand enterprise data lake) support OMOP, SGL, S3 and Redshift. The MIP operates\nas the central integrated data broker and service provider for all healthcare\noperations.\n\nCommercial solutions build upon the MIP and will allow users at all levels of\nthe MHS to access, manipulate, and present patient-specific and enterprise-\nwide health information for making policy, management, and resource allocation\ndecisions.\n\nBackground Information\n\nThese LOEs may be executed by a single vendor bringing a comprehensive\nsolution or by multiple vendors working in a teaming arrangement and\ndemonstrating interoperability.\n\nPrototypes will be implemented through the DHA Accelerator, whose purpose is\nto identify, test and implement emerging solutions in ways that adapt our\nhealthcare delivery model. The Accelerator operates across five MTFs serving a\nbeneficiary population of approximately 260,000. The Accelerator will validate\nsolutions at the five Military Treatments Facilities and prepare those\nsolutions for enterprise-wide adoption. Minimally viable offerings from LOE 1\nwill be implemented at those five sites in six to twelve months from\nacceptance.\n\nMultiple agreement awards are anticipated, and a single company is not\nexpected to provide a solution that covers all solution areas. Preference may\nbe given to product mixes that include solutions with evidence of similar\ndeployments. The DoD may facilitate teaming arrangements among submissions\noffering complimentary capabilities to achieve desired effect. Companies are\nalso welcome to present their own teaming arrangements in their solution\nbriefs. If technology solutions are proprietary, performing companies will be\nexpected to establish business to business safeguards that permit information\nsharing amongst teaming members in pursuit of solutions. Academic research\nproposals are not desired.\n\nSuccessful prototypes will need network accreditation to ensure full\nfunctionality and deployment on DoD systems. Existing authority to operate\n(ATO) or certification as a system of record are a plus. Vendors must possess\nor be able to obtain necessary accreditations to deploy/operate their\nsolutions in Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Impact Level 6 (IL6)\nenvironments.\n\n*Note to offerors: It is anticipated human subjects research may be required in performance of any subsequent agreement(s). Therefore, offerors should be aware that compliance with 32 CFR 219, DoDI 3216.02 will be mandatory, as applicable.\n\n#### Eligibility Requirements\n\n### Awarding Instrument\n\nThis Area of Interest solicitation will be awarded in accordance with the\nCommercial Solutions Opening (CSO) process detailed within HQ0845-20-S-C001\n(DIU CSO), posted to SAM.gov on 13 Jan 2020, updated 02 Oct 2023.
