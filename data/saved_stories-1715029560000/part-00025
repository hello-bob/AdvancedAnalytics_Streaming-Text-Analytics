Outside of poems, they are usually seen on the sides of doors\nleading to people's homes or as hanging scrolls in an interior. Although often\ncalled Chinese couplet or antithetical couplet, they can better be described\nas a written form of counterpoint. The two lines have a one-to-one\ncorrespondence in their metrical length, and each pair of characters must have\ncertain corresponding properties. A duilian is ideally profound yet concise,\nusing one character per word in the style of Classical Chinese. A special,\nwidely-seen type of duilian is the chunlian (simplified Chinese: \u6625\u8054;\ntraditional Chinese: \u6625\u806f; pinyin: ch\u016bnli\u00e1n), used as a New Year's decoration\nthat expresses happiness and hopeful thoughts for the coming year.\n\n## Requirements[edit]\n\nA duilian must adhere to the following rules:\n\n  1. Both lines must have the same number of Chinese characters.\n  2. The lexical category of each character must be the same as its corresponding character.\n  3. The tone pattern of one line must be the inverse of the other. This generally means if one character is of the level (\u5e73) tone, its corresponding character on the other line must be of an oblique (\u4ec4) tone.\n  4. The last character of the first line should be of an oblique tone, which forces the last character of the second line to be of a level tone.\n  5. The meanings of the two lines must be related, with each pair of corresponding characters having related meanings too.\n\n### Example[edit]\n\nExample of a duilian:\n\n    \n\n\u66f8\u5c71\u6709\u8def\u52e4\u7232\u5f91\n\n    Tone pattern: level-level-oblique-oblique-level-level-oblique (\u5e73\u5e73\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u4ec4)\n    Pinyin: sh\u016b sh\u0101n y\u01d2u l\u00f9 q\u00edn w\u00e9i j\u00ecng\n    Translation: The mountain of books has one way and hard work serves as the path\n    \n\n\u5b78\u6d77\u7121\u6daf\u82e6\u4f5c\u821f\n\n    Tone pattern: oblique-oblique-level-level-oblique-oblique-level (\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73)\n    Pinyin: xu\u00e9 h\u01cei w\u00fa y\u00e1 k\u01d4 zu\u00f2 zh\u014du\n    Translation: The sea of learning has no end and effort makes the boat\nBottom| Top  \n---|---  \nknowledge| \u5b78| \u66f8| book  \nsea| \u6d77| \u5c71| mountain  \nhave not| \u7121| \u6709| have  \nborder| \u6daf| \u8def| way  \npainstaking| \u82e6| \u52e4| diligence  \nmakes| \u4f5c| \u7232| is  \nboat| \u821f| \u5f91| path  \n  \n## History and usage[edit]\n\nOriginating during the Five Dynasties, and flourishing during the Ming and\nQing dynasties in particular, duilians have a history of more than a thousand\nyears and remain an enduring aspect of Chinese culture.\n\nOften, duilians are written on red paper and stuck on walls. Sometimes, they\nare carved onto plaques of wood for a more permanent display.\n\nDueling duilians are a popular pastime with Chinese speakers,^[1] a game of\nverbal and intellectual dexterity, wit, and speed which shares some parallels\nwith the dozens.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Couplet\n  * Fai chun\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n  * Arabic duilian outside Tianshui temple\n\n  * Duilian written by a famous poet at Daguan Park\n\n  * Manuscripts in the Yunnan Nationalities Museum, Nakhi weather lore in Dongba symbols\n\n## References and notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Chinese Couplets\". chinesecouplets.dayabook.com.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n  * China the beautiful web site on duilian and chunlian\n  * Hubert Delahaye, \"The duilian, parallel and converging sentences.
