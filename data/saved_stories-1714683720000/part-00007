One of the biggest issues in\nquestion is how much it pays Apple, which was previously estimated to be\nnearly $20 billion \u2014 a figure proven true by a new court filing.\n\nDespite attempts by Google and Apple to keep the payment confidential, details\nemerged during the trial through testimony and accidental disclosures.\nAccording to a report from Bloomberg, court documents revealed that Google\npaid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Apple\nplatforms.\n\nThe $20 billion figure wasn't in Apple or Google's security filings, but it\nwas confirmed by unsealed testimonies. The figure was shared by Eddy Cue,\nApple Senior Vice President of Services, during the trial.\n\nWatch the Latest from AppleInsider TV\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nM2 Max 16' MacBook Pro (2023) Review!

In 2020, the figure was\n17.5% of Apple's total operating income.\n\nGoogle pay Apple $20 billion for default search engine status on iPhone\n\nOther figures were also disclosed by the filing. Microsoft tried to take over\nas the default search engine with Bing by offering 90% of its advertising\nrevenue. Bing was even offered up for sale to Apple in 2020.\n\nThese factors are likely damning for Google's case. Google and the DOJ will\noffer closing arguments on Thursday and Friday, but a decision won't be made\nuntil later in the year.\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\nAndrew Orr\n\nTech Beat Reporter\n\nAndrew is a writer and commentator who has been sharing his insights on\ntechnology since 2015.
