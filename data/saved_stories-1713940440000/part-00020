As you type in your\nprogram, Dafny's verifier constantly looks over your shoulder, flags any\nerrors, shows you counterexamples, and congratulates you when your code\nmatches your specifications. When you're done, Dafny can compile your code to\nC#, Go, Python, Java, or JavaScript (more to come!), so it can integrate with\nyour existing workflow.\n\nDafny will give you assurance that your code meets the specifications you\nwrite, while letting you write both code and specifications in the Dafny\nprogramming language itself. Since verification is an integral part of\ndevelopment, it will thus reduce the risk of costly late-stage bugs that are\ntypically missed by testing.\n\nDafny has support for common programming concepts such as classes and trait\ninheritance, inductive datatypes that can have methods and are suitable for\npattern matching, lazily unbounded datatypes, subset types e.g. for bounded\nintegers, lambdas, and immutable and mutable data structures.\n\nDafny also offers an extensive toolbox for mathematical proofs, such as\nunbounded and bounded quantifiers, calculational proofs, pre- and post-\nconditions, termination conditions, loop invariants, and read/write\nspecifications.\n\nThis github site contains these materials:\n\n  * sources\n  * binary downloads for Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, and FreeBSD\n  * the issue tracker\n  * the wiki, including frequently asked questions\n\nDocumentation about the dafny language and tools is located here. A reference\nmanual is available both online and as pdf. (A LaTeX version can be produced\nif needed.)\n\n## Community\n\nYou can ask questions about Dafny on Stack Overflow or participate in general\ndiscussion on Dafny's .\n\n## Try Dafny\n\nThe easiest way to try out Dafny is to install Dafny on your own machine in\nVisual Studio Code and follow along with the Dafny tutorial. You can also\ndownload and install the Dafny CLI if you prefer to work from the command\nline.\n\n## Read more\n\nHere are some ways to get started with Dafny:\n\n  * 4-part course on the Basics of specification and verification of code:\n\n    * Lecture 0: Pre- and postconditions (19:08)\n    * Lecture 1: Invariants (20:56)\n    * Lecture 2: Binary search (21:14)\n    * Lecture 3: Dutch National Flag algorithm (20:33)\n  * New overview article: Accessible Software Verification with Dafny, IEEE Software, Nov/Dec 2017\n  * Online tutorial, focusing mostly on simple imperative programs\n  * 3-page tutorial notes with examples (ICSE 2013)\n  * Dafny Quick Reference\n  * Language reference for the Dafny type system, which also describes available expressions for each type\n  * Cheatsheet: basic Dafny syntax on two pages\n  * Dafny Reference Manual [html] [pdf]\n  * Dafny libraries, a standard library of useful Dafny functions and lemmas\n  * Dafny Power User\n  * Videos at Verification Corner\n  * Blog\n\nThe language itself draws pieces of influence from:\n\n  * Euclid (from the mindset of a designing a language whose programs are to be verified),\n  * Eiffel (like the built-in contract features),\n  * CLU (like its iterators, and inspiration for the out-parameter syntax),\n  * Java, C#, and Scala (like the classes and traits, and syntax for functions),\n  * ML (like the module system, and its functions and inductive datatypes), and\n  * Coq and VeriFast (like the ability to include co-inductive datatypes and being able to write inductive and co-inductive proofs).\n\n## External contributions\n\n  * Haskell-to-Dafny translator, by Duncan White\n  * Vim-loves-Dafny mode for vim, by Michael Lowell Roberts\n  * Boogie-Friends Emacs mode\n\n## Contributors\n\nInformation and instructions for potential contributors are provided here.\n\n## License\n\nDafny itself is licensed under the MIT license.
