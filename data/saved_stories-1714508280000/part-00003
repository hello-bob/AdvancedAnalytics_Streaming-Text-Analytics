The tests were conducted\nover 328 feet (100 meters), consortium representatives said in the statement.\n\nRolled out in 2019, 5G is the current state-of-the-art wireless communication\nstandard and is used by almost all new smartphones, for example. Average\nT-Mobile speeds in the U.S. are approximately 204.9 megabits per second\n(Mbps), while the theoretical maximum 5G speed is at least 10 Gbps.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM livescience\n\nRelated: Scientists create light-based semiconductor chip that will pave the\nway for 6G\n\nBut scientists are already working on building the sixth generation of this\nstandard, 6G, with the infrastructure in the works ahead of rollout by the\nearly 2030s, according to the GSM Association (GSMA) \u2014 where GSM stands for\nGlobal System for Mobile.\n\nThe main differences between 5G and 6G lie in the frequency bands of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum in which they operate. Operating in higher bands\ngenerally means much higher speeds.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n5G signals are commonly transmitted in bands under 6 GHz and extended into\nbands of around 40 GHz \u2014 known as the \"millimeter-wave bands,\" according to\n6GWorld.\n\n6G, on the other hand, is expected to use higher-frequency bands, known as\n\"sub-THz\" bands, which are between 100 GHz and 300 GHz, according to Nokia.\nTransmitting in this region taps into the advantage of faster speeds but has\nthe disadvantage of greater interference with the environment, with signals\nmore likely to become blocked \u2014 particularly indoors.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014China develops new light-based chiplet that could power artificial general\nintelligence \u2014 where AI is smarter than humans\n\n\u2014Computing 'paradigm shift' could see phones and laptops run twice as fast \u2014\nwithout replacing a single component\n\n\u2014Fiber-optic data transfer speeds hit a rapid 301 Tbps \u2014 1.2 million times\nfaster than your home broadband connection\n\nWhere the jump from 4G to 5G paved the way for much greater volumes of media\nconsumption, the jump from 5G to 6G could lead to new technologies like\nholographic communication and smoother virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality\nexperiences.\n\nBecause 6G relies on much higher frequency bands, however, we would need\ncompletely new infrastructure to transmit and amplify signals, while\nsmartphones or VR devices would require 6G antennae.\n\nIn previous tests, scientists have achieved faster 6G speeds \u2014 but over much\nshorter distances. A different team of scientists in Japan, for example,\ndemonstrated world-record 6G speeds of up to 240 Gbps but only at 66 feet (20\nm), publishing their findings Feb. 10 in the journal IEICE Electronics\nExpress.\n\nKeumars Afifi-Sabet\n\nChannel Editor, Technology\n\nKeumars is the technology editor at Live Science.
