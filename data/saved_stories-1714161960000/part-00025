While I can\u2019t totally\ncure your PEES (Packing Excessive Equipment Syndrome), my tip today may help\nyou take the first step to recovery. If you don\u2019t want to carry your laptop\nwith you in the field, try backing up your photos to a hard drive directly via\nyour smartphone instead.\n\nThat\u2019s all you need to back up your memory card to an SSD with your mobile\ndevice.\n\nI probably don\u2019t need to explain why backing up your photos while you travel\nis a good idea. Personally, I\u2019ve learned through bitter experience \u2013 in my\nyears of photography, I\u2019ve experienced card failure, dropping my backup drive,\nand even theft. These risks are mitigated (though not eliminated) by doing\nregular backups.\n\nIn the field, this means using an external hard drive or two \u2013 no way around\nthat. Unlike at home, when you may be able to rely on a cloud backup system,\nthat rarely works in the field. I think the futility of this method is nicely\ndemonstrated by my friend Tomas Grim\u2019s efforts to push his photos to Dropbox\nwhile traveling in South America...\n\nBacking up via cloud storage is not a good option in remote locations. Photo\nby Tomas Grim\n\nUltimately, I came to appreciate that the best backup strategy on the road is\nto use a pair of rugged SSDs, onto which I transfer my photos at the end of\neach day. I keep one drive at the hotel and take the other with me wherever I\ngo. It\u2019s a great solution that keeps my photos nice and safe.\n\nThe only thing left to figure out is how to get your photos from the memory\ncard to the SSD. Of course, a computer works great for this \u2013 but what if your\nlaptop breaks while you\u2019re traveling, or you want to leave it at home in the\nfirst place in order to travel light? That\u2019s where your phone can step in.\n\nYou are essentially going to take the photos from your memory card, put them\non your phone, and then transfer them off your phone onto an SSD. The whole\nprocess looks like this, in a nutshell:\n\n  1. Connect a card reader with a memory card to your phone (applies to Android and to newer iPhone with USB-C. For other iPhones, see my note after these steps.)\n  2. Copy the photos to a folder in the internal memory of the phone (name it Camera Backup, for example).\n  3. When that\u2019s done, disconnect the card reader and connect your first SSD (I will call it \u201cSSD 1\u201d).\n  4. On SSD 1, create a main folder with the name of your trip (e.g. 2024-04_Europe) and a subfolder containing the date of the backup (e.g. 2024-04-11).\n  5. Copy (not move) the photos in your phone\u2019s Camera Backup folder into this new folder on SSD 1.\n  6. When that\u2019s done, disconnect SSD 1 and attach SSD 2. Repeat the steps above, but move the photos rather than copying this time. This will neatly remove them from your phone.\n  7. The backup is now safely stored on both SSD 1 and SSD 2! Remember to keep SSD 1 in a different location than SSD 2. Do this each day of your trip to have an up-to-date backup.\n\nOn my phone, a connected SSD or memory card reader appears as \u201cUSB Storage\u201d\n(screenshot #1). It\u2019s easy to create a folder for backups on your SSD, labeled\nby the date (screenshot #2).\n\nAlthough the process itself is pretty easy, there are a few technical details\nthat I want to address before concluding this article. First, let me expand\nupon the note I mentioned in Step 1 regarding iPhones.\n\nIf your iPhone has a Lightning port rather than a USB-C port, you can\u2019t just\nplug a memory card reader directly into the phone. Instead, as long as your\ncamera writes to a standard SD card, you should use an SD card reader made for\nLightning ports instead. This one from Apple is only $29.\n\nOn the other hand, if your camera doesn\u2019t write to regular SD cards (like my\nNikon Z9 or the original Nikon Z6/Z7 that only write to CFExpress or XQD),\nyour process will be significantly more complicated. You will need a Lightning\nto USB-A adapter, a USB-A to USB-C cable, and a power supply for the adapter.\nIt works, but it\u2019s fiddly. I think it\u2019s easier just to bring your laptop at\nthat point, instead of trying to make it work with your phone.\n\nIf you have an older iPhone, like these iPhone 11 Pros, the steps can be a\nlittle more complicated. But it\u2019s still doable, especially if you\u2019re just\ntrying to read from a regular SD card.\n\nI also want to mention the importance of having free space on your phone\u2019s\ninternal memory. If your phone only has 10 GB of free storage, and you try to\ntransfer 20 GB of photos, you will run into problems before you ever get the\nchance to pull an SSD out of your bag.\n\nThe good news is that this issue isn\u2019t as big as it may sound. Since you\u2019ll be\nbacking up daily, you only have to deal with the amount of photos taken in 24\nhours, not during the whole trip. And these photos don\u2019t stay on your phone\nfor long \u2013 just long enough to transfer them onto an SSD. However, if you\nshoot a lot of video, or you\u2019re a burst-happy wildlife photographer, just be\naware that backing up via your phone may not be right for you.\n\nBy the way, if your phone allows expandable storage, you might consider\ngetting a 1TB MicroSD card for it. These days, many 1TB MicroSDs are available\nunder $100, and that should be plenty for the number of photos that you might\ncapture in a day.\n\nSome more screenshots of the backup process. You can select either the entire\nfolder on the memory card to copy (screenshot #1) or individual photos\n(screenshot #2). Be sure to copy them from the card, not move them \u2013 you don\u2019t\nwant them to be removed from the card before the backup is complete.\nScreenshots #3 and #4 show the backup in progress.\n\nLastly, if you\u2019re wondering about the speed of data transfer through this\nwhole process, the answer is that it depends! Even phones with USB-C do not\nall have the same transfer speeds.\n\nFor example, my Xiaomi Mi Note 10 smartphone uses the older USB-C 2.0\nstandard. When I tested it, I was able to transfer 7.9 GB of photos in 5\nminutes, 50 seconds (about 23 MB/s). Transferring the same photos from the\ninternal memory to the SSD took 7:23 minutes (about 18MB/s). That\u2019s a total of\n13 minutes, 13 seconds, and I was only transferring 144 14-bit lossless\ncompressed RAW files from my Nikon Z9.\n\nBut wait! If your phone uses the faster USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 standard, like many of\ntoday\u2019s smartphones, it will be much faster. When I tested moving the same\nphotos to the iPhone 15 Pro, it took only 1 minute, 39 seconds (82 MB/s). Then\ntransferring them to an SSD took just 44 seconds. So, the cumulative backup\ntime was just two minutes, 23 seconds. That\u2019s hardly slower than it would have\nbeen on my laptop.\n\nI want to point out that your USB cable needs to support sufficiently fast\ntransfer speeds. For example, even with the iPhone 15 Pro (a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2\nphone), Apple only includes a cable in the box that supports USB 2.0 transfer\nspeeds! If you\u2019re getting slower transfers than expected, the cable, not the\nphone, may be to blame.\n\nX-T5 + XF100-400mmF4.5-5.6 R LM OIS WR @ 400mm, ISO 250, 1/500, f/5.6\n\nAnd now, your precious photos or videos are safe. So is your computer, which\nyou can leave at home \u2013 good for preventing thieves and preventing PEES.\n\nWhat are the downsides? The big one is that this technique is only fast and\neasy to use if you have the right combination of phone and camera. If your\nphone only supports USB-C 2.0 transfer speeds, or doesn\u2019t have enough free\nspace, it\u2019s may not be worth bothering with this method. Also, if you have\nyour laptop with you anyway, it\u2019s still quicker to back up photos to SSDs\nusing your laptop than your phone.\n\nEven with those drawbacks, I believe that backing up photos to a hard drive\nvia your phone is a very viable option. If nothing else, it\u2019s good to have\nthis technique in your back pocket in case your laptop breaks while you\u2019re\ntraveling. If there\u2019s one thing you shouldn\u2019t skimp on, it\u2019s keeping your\nphotos backed up!\n\n### Related Articles\n\n  * TerraMaster D2-310 Hard Drive Enclosure Review\n\n  * Nikon Z8 Official Sample Photos\n\n  * Aukey Cell Phone Camera Lens Review\n\n  * Backing up Photos in the Back Country\n\n  * How to Photograph Food with a Camera Phone\n\n  * How to Light Macro Photos\n\nDisclosures, Terms and Conditions and Support Options\n\nFiled Under: Camera Gear Accessories Tagged With: Back-Up Strategy, Backup,\nSmartphone, SSD Drive, Travel\n\n#### About Libor Vaicenbacher\n\nLibor works as a biology teacher, guide, photographer and photography course\nlecturer.

One problem folks may run into is figuring out which images have\nalready been backed up. You don\u2019t want to get into the situation of\nincreasingly large full backups instead of incremental ones. My solution is to\ndesignate a new numerical file folder number for each day of the trip. Each\nfolder can typically hold 10k images, which should exceed your daily shooting\noutput.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nPeter\n\nApril 25, 2024 12:36 pm\n\nI have a Canon DSLR and each night I connect the camera directly to my iPad\n(via the Canon Connect app using bluetooth or wifi) and I make a selection of\nenough images (not all) to cover the days shooting. No need for card readers\netc. These selected images are then copied (not moved) to my iPad. Overnight\nmy iPad then backups/syncs my images to iCloud as normal. I only want enough\nimages on the iPad to know I can still produce a photobook or have images\nprinted when I get home. If something happens to my Camera or iPad I can still\naccess the images on the iCloud. This method has worked flawlessly for me.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nPlurikus\n\nApril 25, 2024 1:07 am\n\nWhy not an SSD with a built in card readers (CFexpress/XQD and SD), with a\nsmall display. Put in the card, the display ask if it shall copy files (All\nfiles / only new files) and you\u2019re finished! If more controls are needed,\ncreate an app and connect with bluetooth. Does that product exist? If not, who\nwill design one?\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nPRG Lagarde\n\nApril 24, 2024 9:09 pm\n\nAs someone already noticed, it can be made with a one step process.

I just tested the option of\ntransferring photos directly from the card to the SSD using the hub, and\ndespite some hardware limitations, it seems to be a really workable solution.\nIt looks like you just have to pick the right hub. I\u2019ve written more about\nthis in the thread below the Car post. Have a nice day.\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nTony\n\nApril 24, 2024 3:08 pm\n\nFor many years I\u2019ve used a Colorspace UDMA device for this purpose. It\u2019s\nbasically a combined card reader and hard drive enclosure with a screen and a\nbasic UI, and it\u2019s designed to back up memory cards. I\u2019ve used a couple hand-\nme-down SSDs from PC upgrades that have worked very well. I think they are\ndiscontinued.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s still another item to bring, and since I always bring my iPad\nanyway, I started using that instead. Forget the external drive, I just back\nup the files to the iPad with the Apple card reader.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLibor Vaicenbacher\n\nAuthor\n\nReply to Tony\n\nApril 25, 2024 1:29 am\n\nThank you for your comment Tony. I\u2019m glad you mentioned the Colorspace UDMA\ndevice. That is an interesting thing. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve never seen anyone\nactually using it. Also, it does not seem to support the CFexpress cards and\nalso its production has probably been discontinued as you mentioned\n(www.bhphotovideo.com/c/sea...038;sts=ma).\n\nCopying photos directly to an iPad (or tablet) is definitely a viable option.\nIt would eliminate the need for two SSDs. Alternatively, it\u2019s possible to have\neverything on memory cards + on the iPad. This would completely eliminate the\nneed for an SSD, only the storage space on the cards is the most expensive.\nUnfortunately, the files produced by cameras like the Nikon Z9, Canon R5 or\nSony A1 are so large that the iPad would blow up like a balloon after a few\ndays. However, a friend who shoots with the OM system backs up in this way.\nI.e. from card to iPhone and copy on SSD.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nCar\n\nApril 24, 2024 2:01 pm\n\nYou are making it to complicated. I use a hub, it\u2019s about an inch by 3 inches,\nand transfer images from a card reader directly to the backup drive, Samsung\nT7. Simple, your phone acts as a computer to manage the process. I\u2019ve been\ndoing this for a few years!! Research, research, before writing your story.\n\n2\n\nReply\n\nLibor Vaicenbacher\n\nAuthor\n\nReply to Car\n\nApril 25, 2024 1:01 am\n\nThank you for the valuable suggestion to give this \u201chub\u201d solution another\nchance. The result is quite interesting. The first test was done with a hub\nthat normally works on a Mac mini. On it, the hub works as expected, i.e. two\nSSDs or a reader and an SSD can be connected to it without problems. After\nconnecting it to the iPhone 15 Pro, it was possible to read both the files on\nthe SSD and the photos on the card in the reader (both devices connected via\nUSB-C). However, when copying, an error occurred after a few seconds and the\nSSD started making strange sounds (I had no idea that SSDs could make sounds).\nAnother hub with an integrated SD card reader that allows you to connect the\nSSD via the USB-A port worked significantly better. In this case, the transfer\nwent smoothly at about 83 MB/s. This is the speed at which the iPhone 15 Pro\nis able to transfer photos from the reader to the internal memory. By\neliminating the subsequent copying (moving) to the SSD, this is a clear time-\nsaver. Connecting both the reader and the SSD via USB-A proved to be another\nviable option. In summary, connecting a reader + SSD via a USB-C to 2 x USB-C\nhub has proven problematic (I\u2019ll have to check if this is a rule or just a\nhub-specific issue). Connecting via a USB-C to 2 x USB-A hub (or integrated\nreader + USB-A) is a workable alternative.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nBernhard J.\n\nReply to Libor Vaicenbacher\n\nApril 25, 2024 2:32 am\n\nI used the USB-hub method for quite a while (integrated SD/microSD reader &\nexternal XQD/CFexpress) with Android phones. The key point however is that my\nUSB-hub needs to be powered externally via USB-C (power supply or power bank)\nin order to work. The phone\u2019s USB port usually can\u2019t deliver enough power to\nsupply a SSD and an external card reader\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLibor Vaicenbacher\n\nAuthor\n\nReply to Bernhard J.\n\nApril 25, 2024 2:56 am\n\nThank you, Bernhard, for your contribution. So this is a similar situation to\nthe older iPhones with the Lightning port. What port do you use to connect the\nexternal reader for XQD/CFexpress to the hub? USB-A or USB-C?\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nBernhard J.\n\nReply to Libor Vaicenbacher\n\nApril 25, 2024 10:48 am\n\nThe hub has only USB-A ports, but connects via USB-C to the phone\n(www.amazon.com.au/USB-H...B3F5Y?th=1)\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAdam\n\nApril 24, 2024 1:36 pm\n\nThanks Libor! I do something similar, but with an iPad and a mini usb hub,\nthat way I can transfer files directly from the memory card onto the hard\ndrive. That way you don\u2019t have to have that much internal storage, and it\u2019s\none step instead of two. You do need to carry around the small hub though :)\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLibor Vaicenbacher\n\nAuthor\n\nReply to Adam\n\nApril 24, 2024 10:44 pm\n\nThank you for your experience, Adam, and for inspiring me to do more research.\nUnfortunately, I have a different experience with my hub. I need to try\nanother one (on a different device?) and will be happy to update the article.\nBecause skipping a step is certainly a tempting option.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nDavid Kennedy\n\nReply to Libor Vaicenbacher\n\nApril 25, 2024 9:38 am\n\nI also use a hub attached to my IPad Pro \u2013 2nd generation. The hub is a USB C\nSOHO dock from CalDigit. I researched USB C hubs and this hub was highly\nrecommended. I connect a UDB C CF-express B card reader and a Samsung SSD via\nUSBC-USBA. To make this work, I had to get a 67 W USBC charger \u2013 a lower\ncapacity would not power all the accessories. I also found that only certain\nUSBC cables can throughput the power to the hub. All of this would really not\nbe possible prior to the new files app in IOS/IpadOS and USBC. I have\npersonally not tried to make a double backup but I\u2019m sure if you swapped out\nthe card reader for a second SSD. You could backup the first SSD.\n\nIt\u2019s still a debatable question whether it would be better to get an MacBook\nAir rather than an IPad. But, that\u2019s another issue.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nJason Polak\n\nAdmin\n\nApril 24, 2024 12:55 pm\n\nThanks for this guide, Libor! It\u2019s definitely something everyone should think\nabout while traveling. I like the cheap laptop idea, because you can also cull\non the road and have something to do at night when the birds go away, but the\nphone solution is great also for lightweight travel.\n\nI do wish there was a device though that would make this process a lot\nsimpler. Something like a small Raspberry-Pi-like thing that would have two\nUSB ports: one for the external hard drive and one for a cable from a card\nreader. Upon plugging the hard drive and card reader cable into it, it would\nautomatically \u201crsync\u201d everything from the card onto a new folder on the hard\ndrive. It would have a single light that turns from red to green when the\nprocess is finished, after which it would automatically unmount both external\nmedia. Then it would work with both SD and CFExpress cards.\n\n3\n\nReply\n\nAdrian\n\nReply to Jason Polak\n\nApril 24, 2024 10:44 pm\n\n@Jason There is already such a device. It\u2019s the Western Digital My Passport\nWireless Pro. Unfortunately, it seems to be discontinued. It had a 4 TB HDD\nintegrated. It had WiFi (two separate ones!), so you could connect to the\nphone without cable but also to a hotel WiFi at the same time. The software\nwas a bit of a mess but at least working. Did I mention, it had an integrated\nbattery? Not to forget, that you could start tge backup process either via a\nbutton, automatically when inserting the SD card or via an app. The idea was\nreally great but probably the market too small for WD. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u2642\ufe0f I hope the App\nwill continue to work for some more years...\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAdrian\n\nReply to Adrian\n\nApril 24, 2024 11:04 pm\n\nI just found the NEWQ Filehub AC750. It does not have an integrated SSD/HDD\nbut this might be a plus point regarding flexibility and sustainability. I\nalso did not found, if it can connect to your phone and a hotel WiFi at the\nsame time like the WD, but this also avoids some security risks.\n\nAnyone using this?\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLibor Vaicenbacher\n\nAuthor\n\nReply to Jason Polak\n\nApril 25, 2024 1:40 am\n\nHonestly Jason, I often end up with the cheap laptop option too.\nUnfortunately, with the Z9, it turns out my laptop might be too cheap. Two\nUSB-C ports on a portable device would certainly be great, and would eliminate\nthe need to wonder which hub works and which doesn\u2019t. I would also like to see\nthe ability to expand internal storage with microSD as standard. With 1.5TB of\nstorage on my phone, I\u2019d be fine for very long trips to the epicenters of\navian diversity.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nJason Polak\n\nAdmin\n\nReply to Libor Vaicenbacher\n\nApril 25, 2024 4:27 am\n\nThat is true, Libor. 1.5GB is definitely enough for most trips and most\npeople. I actually only used about 30GB on my last trip. Even if I shot 10\nshots for every one I took, that would be 300GB!\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nNigel\n\nApril 24, 2024 12:48 pm\n\nI use a USB SD card adapter which fits into the OTG adapter that comes with\nSamsung Phones. I have a 128gb Micro SD in the phone which holds my backup\nimages whilst on holiday as well as keeping the cards with me.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLibor Vaicenbacher\n\nAuthor\n\nReply to Nigel\n\nApril 25, 2024 1:49 am\n\nMicroSD in the phone is a great solution. The only problem is that both the\nphone (i.e. the backup) and the cards you have the originals on are in the\nsame place. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll lose both the camera and the phone at\nthe same time, but in the event of theft or robbery, those are the first\nthings a robber would be interested in. Unfortunately, the experience of\npeople who have had this happen to them is that robbers have little\nunderstanding of our precious photos and refuse to release at least the memory\ncards.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\n#### Learn\n\n  * Beginner Photography\n  * Landscape Photography\n  * Wildlife Photography\n  * Portraiture\n  * Post-Processing\n  * Advanced Tutorials\n\n#### Reviews\n\n  * Camera Reviews\n  * Lens Reviews\n  * Other Gear Reviews\n  * Best Cameras and Lenses\n\n#### Photography Tutorials\n\nPhotography Basics\n\nLandscape Photography\n\nWildlife Photography\n\nMacro Photography\n\nComposition & Creativity\n\nBlack & White Photography\n\nNight Sky Photography\n\nPortrait Photography\n\nStreet Photography\n\nPhotography Videos\n\n#### Unique Gift Ideas\n\n#### Subscribe via Email\n\nIf you like our content, you can subscribe to our newsletter to receive weekly\nemail updates using the link below:\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n#### Site Menu\n\n  * About Us\n  * Beginner Photography\n  * Lens Database\n  * Lens Index\n  * Photo Spots\n  * Search\n  * Forum\n\n#### Reviews\n\n  * Reviews Archive\n  * Camera Reviews\n  * Lens Reviews\n  * Other Gear Reviews\n\n#### More\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Subscribe\n  * Workshops\n  * Support Us\n  * Submit Content\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 \u00b7 Photography Life\n\n", "frontpage": false}
