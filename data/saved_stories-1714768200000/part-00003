AFP\n\nAlkesh Sharma\n\nMay 02, 2024\n\nPowered by automated translation\n\nApple announced its largest share buyback programme, worth $110 billion, on\nThursday after reporting an annual drop in its March quarter net profit and\nrevenues.\n\nApple\u2019s chief financial officer Luca Maestri said the board has authorised the\nshare repurchases \u201cgiven our confidence in Apple\u2019s future and the value we see\nin our stock\u201d.\n\nThe Cupertino-based company reported a 2.2 per cent annual drop in the 2024\nfiscal second-quarter net profit to more than $23.6 billion. Its earnings per\nshare stood at $1.53.\n\nRevenue during the January-March period dropped more than 4 per cent to $90.8\nbillion, slightly exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates of $90 billion.\n\nBut chief executive Tim Cook said he expects a sales growth in the current\nquarter as the company increases its investment on artificial intelligence-\ndriven features that will be announced in coming months.\n\nApple chief executive Tim Cook. EPA\n\n\u201cMore than ever in the past decade, the company needs new products and\nsolutions that will shift its behemoth operating costs back into the sustained\ngrowth path,\u201d Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, told The\nNational.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, Apple will need massive mid-term investor support and\ntrust, which is why it announced its largest-ever round of buybacks.\u201d\n\nAfter the earnings announcement, Apple stock surged 11.6 per cent to trade at\n$184.64 a share in after-hours trading on Thursday.\n\nIt closed 2.20 per cent up at $173.03, giving the company a market value of\n$2.67 trillion.\n\nIts stock has dropped almost 7 per cent since the start of the year.\n\n## Falling iPhone sales\n\niPhone sales accounted for more than half of the company's total revenue in\nthe last quarter.\n\nThey dropped 10.4 per cent to nearly $45.9 billion in the quarter from the\nyear before period, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of $46 billion.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nApple sends out iPhone spyware warnings in 92 countries: What you need to know\n\nHow Apple is using its latest M chips to lure gamers away from Intel PCs to\nMacs\n\nAnalysts said the decline in sales indicates a lacklustre demand for the\nlatest generation of iPhone 15 series, which was launched in September.\n\nIn its defence, Mr Cook said last quarter\u2019s iPhone sales faced tough\ncomparison with the previous year period, during which the company recorded $5\nbillion in deferred iPhone 14 sales stemming from supply issues caused by the\nCovid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company\u2019s total revenue from its services division grew about 14 per cent\nannually to almost $23.9 billion, while revenue from wearables, home and\naccessories products dropped 9.6 per cent annually to more than $7.9 billion.\n\nIt was an all-time revenue record in the company\u2019s services division.\n\nRevenue from iPads and computers dropped almost 6 per cent to more than $13\nbillion.\n\n\u201cThanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, our active\ninstalled base of devices has reached a new all-time high across all products\nand all geographic segments,\u201d said Mr Maestri, without disclosing the exact\nnumber.\n\n## Why Tim Cook is optimistic about China\n\nApple\u2019s sales in the Americas region accounted for more than 41 per cent of\nthe company's total second-quarter revenue, with more than $37.2 billion.\n\nIt was followed by Europe and the Greater China market (China, Hong Kong and\nTaiwan), which added $24.1 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, to the\ncompany\u2019s revenue.\n\nA man uses uses Apple Vision Pro glasses in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. AFP\n\nIn Europe, sales remained flat while they dropped 8 per cent in the Greater\nChina market.\n\nApple is facing stiff competition in China from local brands such as Huawei,\nXiaomi and Oppo. But Mr Cook is optimistic about the Chinese market\u2019s future\npotential.\n\n\u201cI feel good about China. I think more about long term than to the next week\nor so,\u201d Mr Cook told CNBC.\n\nJapan and the rest of the Asia Pacific market added more than $12.9 billion to\nApple\u2019s second-quarter sales, an annual drop of 15 per cent.\n\nApple said its board of directors had declared a cash dividend, payable on May\n16, of $0.25 for each share of the company\u2019s common stock.\n\nIts cash and cash equivalents surged 9.1 per cent annually to more than $32.6\nbillion as of March 30.\n\n## Why Apple needs more futuristic products like Vision Pro\n\nIn February, Apple also entered the augmented reality headset market with the\nlaunch of the Vision Pro.\n\nWith a hefty price of almost $3,500, the product has had a slow start and may\ntake few years before it significantly contributes to Apple's revenue,\nanalysts said.\n\n\"However, the sustained downtrend in iPhone sales and pressured margins show\nthat the revenue growth plateau is more than a regional problem and should\nkeep on deepening without new, more innovative products,\" Mr Monteiro said.\n\nApple is expected to announce a range of new products at an event next week,\nand at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\n\nApple unveiled its first Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984.
