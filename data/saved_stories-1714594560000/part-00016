In\nan audio recording, a political party representative can be heard calling a\nvoter to inquire about the problems they face in their locality and seeking\nsuggestions to address them.\n\nSome of these visuals and audio clips are so realistic that a layperson would\nnever guess they \u2014 along with the other content in Jadaoun\u2019s catalog \u2014 have\nbeen created using artificial intelligence.\n\nJadoun is the founder of Polymath Solution, a synthetic media company that\nstarted creating AI content for politicians in November last year. In just six\nmonths, the nine-member company \u2014 run out of an office in the small western\nIndian town of Pushkar \u2014 has worked on election campaigns for several major\npolitical parties, including the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the\nleading opposition party Indian National Congress.\n\nThe nine-person team at Polymath Solution expects to generate $241,000 in\nrevenue during India\u2019s six-week election period.\n\nWith his content catalog, Jadoun has secured half a dozen political\ncampaigning deals. The company expects to generate $241,000 in revenue during\nthe six-week-long elections.\n\nIt\u2019s not a tough target.\n\nAI content makers like Polymath are sought after by national and regional\npoliticians in India amid what is being touted as the biggest election in the\nworld. Four AI content agencies told Rest of World they are seeing more demand\nthan they can manage, with political parties in the country projected to spend\nover $50 million on AI-generated campaign material this year. Even as they\nlook to maximize their earnings, however, the AI content companies are\nfiltering out \u201cunethical\u201d requests for fake content that could propagate\nmisinformation.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t work with 10 parties parallelly; I don\u2019t have the bandwidth for\nthat,\u201d Senthil Nayagam, founder of AI media tech firm Muonium, based in the\nsouthern state of Tamil Nadu, told Rest of World. His company works only with\npolitical parties it can \u201ctrust and can vouch for,\u201d he said.\n\nPolymath Solution built an app for Sikkim\u2019s chief minister, Prem Singh Tamang,\nusing a QR code that allows supporters to generate a selfie with the\npolitician.\n\nIndia\u2019s general elections, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is up for a\nthird term, are being held in seven phases. The first phase concluded on April\n19, and the last phase is scheduled for June 1.\n\nNayagam started taking on political assignments in January. His first\nprominent project was with Tamil Nadu\u2019s ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)\nparty. Nayagam\u2019s team created an AI video of the party\u2019s deceased iconic\nleader, M Karunanidhi, endorsing the state administration.\n\nJust three months on, Nayagam is so swamped with contracts for political AI\ncontent that he has hired external studios, photographers, sound engineers,\nand editors to keep up with deadlines.\n\n\u201cWe have hired people who have previously worked in [the film] industry in VFX\n[or] CGI ... for high-quality output and fast delivery,\u201d said Nayagam, who has\nworked with several regional parties. If a client\u2019s project requires a larger\nworkforce, he brings in people with experience in audio, video, and visual\neffects.\n\nMuonium is working on campaigns for close to 10 politicians, and has earned\nhundreds of thousands of dollars, Nayagam said. He declined to disclose the\nexact numbers. \u201cEach candidate is willing to spend over a million rupees\n[$12,000] on using AI technology for their election campaigning,\u201d he said. The\ncompany had charged over $12,000 for the Karunanidhi video.\n\nA video for Prem Singh Tamang\u2019s campaign uses AI to display him as a larger-\nthan-life figure. Polymath Solution\n\nSome of the most popular AI content during election campaigning this year\nincludes personalized videos that can be circulated on WhatsApp, 3D holograms\nthat can be viewed by scanning a QR code, and deepfake videos of politicians\nthat are posted on social media platforms.\n\nAvantari Technologies, an AI content agency based in the southern city of\nHyderabad, receives requests for politicians\u2019 deepfake videos on a near-daily\nbasis. CEO Bhairav Shankar told Rest of World the company declines such\nrequests. Avantari was among the first to use digital tools in election\ncampaigns. In 2012, during the Gujarat state elections, the company developed\n3D holograms for then-Chief Minister Modi.\n\n\u201cWe work in the political space and [to] successfully work in the political\nspace, it\u2019s very important to maintain our reputation,\u201d Shankar said. Without\ndisclosing a name, he said the company has chosen to focus solely on one\npolitical party to maintain project integrity. \u201cWe would not want to besmirch\nit by ... doing anything that is unethical. We\u2019re happy to do everything that\nwe can to make our party win, but not cross the line.\u201d\n\nPolitical parties are willing to invest millions in a technology-driven\ncampaign if it achieves their objectives, Shankar said. If a party is trying\nto run a campaign which could \u201ctouch almost every person in [their] state,\u201d\neven a fee of $10 million \u201cbecomes a very average figure\u201d to pay, he said.\n\nBut despite AI companies like Avantari turning down requests for political\ndeepfakes, several such videos have circulated on the Indian internet this\nelection season. Some recent viral deepfakes showed prominent Bollywood\ncelebrities Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh criticizing Modi.\n\nPopular AI content for election campaigns includes language-specific videos,\n3D holograms that can be viewed using QR codes, and deepfake videos of\npoliticians.\n\nCompanies told Rest of World they often encounter a conflict of interest \u2014\nwhen two opposing parties approach them at once.\n\nIf a deal is finalized, an AI agency usually doesn\u2019t work with opposition\nparties in the same state or area, Jadoun said. \u201cBut nobody has ever asked us\nalso if you work with opposition candidates.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no upper limit to what an agency can charge for its services, Sagar\nVishnoi, a Delhi-based political strategist, told Rest of World.\n\n\u201cIndividual party expenditures vary, with major parties potentially earmarking\nover a million dollars for AI initiatives,\u201d he said. \u201cBut an average Lok Sabha\n[the lower house of Indian Parliament] candidate might allocate approximately\n$80,000 to $90,000, depending on financial capability and recognition of the\neffectiveness of innovative campaign strategies.\u201d\n\nPolymath has a tiered pricing structure based on project complexity. When it\ncomes to personalized video messaging, the company charges 60,000 rupees\n($720) for voice cloning, 1 lakh rupees ($1,200) for digital avatar creation,\nand up to 2 lakh rupees ($2,400) for WhatsApp integration. Meanwhile, Avantari\ncharges 10 lakh rupees ($12,000) for voice cloning, and up to 25 rupees (30\ncents) per video message. \u201cFor WhatsApp integration, we make a separate\napplication and run a call center for bulk messaging. This costs 30 rupees [36\ncents] per WhatsApp message,\u201d Shankar said.\n\nDivyendra Singh Jadoun is the founder of Polymath Solution, which started\ncreating AI content for politicians in the last six months.\n\nPayments are usually made in three installments. \u201cAfter signing the NDA, we\nreceive the first installment of [30%],\u201d Varun Bisaria, who manages clients\nfor Polymath, told Rest of World. The other two installments are paid after\nthe content is finalized and the project completed.\n\nBefore finalizing a deal, all the four AI agencies make their clients sign\nnondisclosure agreements, outlining ethical guidelines and the details,\nduration, and pricing of the content created. The agreement includes the\npayment schedule for the project.\n\nOnce Polymath has received data from the client, it starts training AI for\nvoice modulation, pronunciation of names in different languages and dialects,\nand lip-syncing, Jadoun said. The videos are then tailored to the client\u2019s\nlanguage preference and distributed over WhatsApp using algorithms to\npersonalize the outreach to each recipient.\n\nJadoun has begun outsourcing work to freelance developers he finds on\nInstagram and LinkedIn. \u201cOur workload is increasing, so we\u2019ve started\nexpanding our in-house team as well,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Avantari, the company\u2019s AI engineers develop and deploy the software. The\nmost important members in the team, according to Shankar, are the quality\ncontrollers, who check the quality of the content before it reaches voters.\n\nThe demand for AI material is higher in some states than others, depending on\nthe local politicians\u2019 campaign budgets, Diggaj Mogra, director of Jarvis\nConsulting, a Mumbai-based political consulting firm, told Rest of World.\nMogra is working with Modi\u2019s BJP during this election.\n\nPolymath Solution\u2019s rates range from $720 to $12,000.\n\nElection campaign spending in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh,\nTelangana, and Karnataka is \u201chefty,\u201d which means there is a higher investment\nin tech-related tools, according to Mogra. In contrast, he said, the budgets\nare much smaller in Bihar.\n\n\u201cWhile only a handful of parties embrace technology fully,\u201d some are willing\nto invest up to 20% of their total campaign budget on communication tools like\nWhatsApp and an AI-enabled interactive voice response system, he said.\n\nAs parties pump more money into AI campaign materials, there are risks that\nthe technology might be misused, Mogra said. He said he knows of some\npoliticians who are planning to launch defamatory attacks using AI-generated\ncontent. Deepfake experts have previously told Rest of World that AI can also\nbe used as cover when politicians want to distance themselves from\nunflattering content.\n\nAI is still in its infancy, according to Mogra. It does not have the same\nimpact as on-the-ground campaigning because it currently plays only \u201ca\nsupporting part,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next elections of 2029, AI will be a big\nthing, but right now, it is only in the experimental phase.\u201d\n\nFahad Shah is a journalist and editor based in India.\n\nRead more stories\n\nSilicon Valley in Rest of World\n\nArgentines are recruiting friends, strangers into Worldcoin\u2019s cash-for-\neyeballs scheme\n\nWith inflation and unemployment gripping the nation, a burgeoning network of\nintermediaries is convincing people to have their irises scanned at Worldcoin\nOrb centers.\n\nBy Luc\u00eda Cholakian Herrera\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nThe TikTok ban is bigger than just ByteDance\n\nThe U.S. clampdown on Chinese-owned companies won't end here.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\nThe Rise of AI\n\nAfrican universities are failing to prepare tech graduates for jobs in AI\n\nDozens of new AI training startups are filling the gap, offering online\ncourses, hackathons, and job placement help.\n\nBy Kimberly Mutandiro\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": false}
