With some models\ncapable of processing over 1 million tokens, their ability to handle long\ncontexts is truly impressive. However:\n\n  1. Many data structures are too complex and constantly evolving for LLMs to handle effectively on their own.\n  2. Managing massive, heterogeneous enterprise data within a context window is simply impractical.\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps address these issues, but retrieval\naccuracy is a major bottleneck for end-to-end performance. One solution is\nintegrating LLMs with big data through advanced SQL vector databases. This\ntype of synergy between LLMs and big data not only makes LLMs more effective\nbut also enables people to gain better intelligence from big data. Moreover,\nit further reduces model hallucination while providing data transparency and\nreliability.\n\n## Current State of Vector Databases\n\nAs the cornerstone of RAG systems, vector databases have developed rapidly in\nthe past year. They can generally be categorized into three types: dedicated\nvector databases, keyword and vector retrieval systems, and SQL vector\ndatabases. Each has advantages and limitations.\n\nZoom\n\n### Specialized Vector Databases\n\nSome vector databases (like Pinecone, Weaviate and Milvus) are designed\nspecifically for vector search from the outset. They exhibit good performance\nin this area but have somewhat limited general data management capabilities.\n\nMyScale is an open-source SQL vector database that allows to effectively\nmanage massive volumes of both structured and vector data for developing\nrobust AI applications. It enables every developer to build production-grade\nGenAI applications with powerful and familiar SQL.\n\nLearn More\n\nThe latest from MyScale\n\n### Keyword and Vector Retrieval Systems\n\nRepresented by Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, these systems are widely used in\nproduction due to their comprehensive keyword-based retrieval capabilities.\nHowever, they consume substantial system resources, and the accuracy and\nperformance of keyword and vector hybrid queries are often unsatisfactory.\n\n### SQL Vector Databases\n\nA SQL vector database is a specialized type of database that combines the\ncapabilities of traditional SQL databases with the abilities of a vector\ndatabase. It provides the ability to efficiently store and query high-\ndimensional vectors with the help of SQL.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. Top 10 Tools for Data Engineers\n  2. Microsoft Excel Becomes a Proper Programming Language\n  3. Visualizing Time-Series Data with ECharts and InfluxDB\n  4. How to Accelerate Your Presto / Trino Queries\n  5. Why and When You Need Transactional DDL in Your Database\n\nTwo major SQL vector databases are illustrated in the figure above: pgvector\nand MyScaleDB. Pgvector is a vector search plugin for PostgreSQL. It is easy\nto get started with and useful for managing small data sets. However, due to\nPostgres\u2019 row storage disadvantages and vector algorithm limitations, pgvector\ntends to have lower accuracy and performance for large-scale, complex vector\nqueries.\n\nMyScaleDB is an open source SQL vector database built on ClickHouse (a\ncolumnar storage SQL database). It is designed to provide a high-performance\nand cost-effective data foundation for GenAI applications. MyScaleDB is also\nthe first SQL vector database to outperform specialized vector databases in\noverall performance and cost-effectiveness.\n\nZoom\n\nSource: MyScale GitHub\n\n## The Power of SQL and Vector Joint Data Modeling\n\nDespite the emergence of NoSQL and big data technologies, SQL databases\ncontinue to dominate the data management market half a century after SQL\u2019s\ninception. Even systems like Elasticsearch and Spark have added SQL\ninterfaces. With SQL support, MyScaleDB enables high performance in vector\nsearch and analytics.\n\nIn real-world AI applications, integrating SQL and vectors enhances data\nmodeling flexibility and simplifies development. For instance, a large-scale\nacademic product uses MyScaleDB for intelligent Q&A over massive scientific\nliterature data. The main SQL schema includes over 10 tables, several with\nvector and keyword-based inverted index structures, connected via primary and\nforeign keys. The system handles complex queries involving structured, vector\nand keyword data and joined queries across multiple tables. This is a\nchallenging task for specialized vector databases, which often leads to slow\niteration, inefficient querying and high maintenance costs.\n\nZoom\n\nThe main SQL vector database schema of a large-scale academic product\nsupported by MyScale (columns in bold have associated vector indexes or\ninverted indexes).\n\n## Improving RAG Accuracy and Cost-Efficiency\n\nIn real-world RAG systems, overcoming retrieval accuracy (and the associated\nperformance bottlenecks) requires an efficient way to combine querying of\nstructured, vector and keyword data.\n\nFor instance, in a financial application, when users query a document database\nasking, \u201cWhat was the revenue of <company_name> in 2023 globally?\u201d structured\nmetadata like \u201c<company_name>\u201d and \u201c2023\u201d may not be captured by semantic\nvectors or present in consecutive text. Vector retrieval across the entire\ndatabase can yield noisy results, reducing final accuracy.\n\nHowever, information such as company names and years can often be obtained as\ndocument metadata. Using WHERE year=2023 AND company LIKE \"%<company_name>%\"\nas filtering conditions for vector queries can precisely pinpoint relevant\ninformation, significantly increasing system reliability. In finance,\nmanufacturing and research, we have observed SQL vector data modeling and\njoint querying to improve precision from 60% to 90%.\n\nWhile traditional database products have recognized the importance of vector\nqueries in the LLM era and started adding vector capabilities, there are still\nsignificant issues with the accuracy of their combined queries. For example,\nin filter-search scenarios, Elasticsearch\u2019s queries per second (QPS) rate\ndrops to about five when the filtering ratio is 0.1, and PostgreSQL with the\npgvector plugin has an accuracy of only about 50% when the filtering ratio is\n0.01. This demonstrates unstable query accuracy and performance that greatly\nlimit their usage. In contrast, SQL vector database MyScale achieves over 100\nQPS and 98% accuracy in various filtering ratio scenarios, at 36% of the cost\nof pgvector and 12% of the cost of Elasticsearch.\n\nZoom\n\n## LLM + Big Data: Building a Next-Generation Agent Platform\n\nMachine learning and big data have fueled the success of web and mobile apps.\nBut with the rise of LLMs, we\u2019re shifting gears to build a new breed of LLMs\nwith big data solutions. These solutions unlock key capabilities for large-\nscale data processing, knowledge retrieval, observability, data analysis, few-\nshot learning and more. They create a closed loop between data and AI, forming\nthe foundation for a next-gen LLM + big data agent platform. This paradigm\nshift is already underway in sectors like scientific research, finance,\nindustry and healthcare.\n\nZoom\n\nWith the rapid development of technology, some form of artificial general\nintelligence (AGI), is expected to emerge within the next five to 10 years.\nRegarding this issue, we must ask: Do we need a static, virtual model, or\nanother more comprehensive solution? Data is undoubtedly the important link\nconnecting LLMs, users and the world. Our vision is to organically integrate\nLLMs and big data to create a more professional, real-time and collaborative\nAI system, which is also full of human warmth and value.\n\nYou are welcome to explore the MyScaleDB repository on GitHub and leverage SQL\nand vectors to build innovative, production-level AI applications.\n\nLinpeng Tang, Co-founder and CTO of MyScale.
