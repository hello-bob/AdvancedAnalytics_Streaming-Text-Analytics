For\nthe most part, that meant hybrid teaching\u2014that is, addressing roughly half the\nclass in person, masked and social distanced, and the other half through a\nscreen. Miracles of modern technology facilitated this weird manner of\nteaching. Zoom and Swivl were two words I\u2019d never used before in conjunction\nbut that now became part of my daily vocabulary. One day I was teaching\nthrough my mask and screen and a not entirely rare feeling came over me: no\none was listening. I couldn\u2019t be certain because the Zoom students were on\nmute and, despite my hectoring, their cameras were off, and the faces of the\nin-class folks were mostly covered, so they looked more like bank robbers than\nhigh school students. I tested my hypothesis by telling the funniest joke in\nmy admittedly limited repertoire. No laughs. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t have been\nable to see any smiles, or hear laughter from the muted Zoom students. Still,\nnot even a body twitch from those in class. I\u2019d lost them.\n\nTime went by. Blessedly, we threw away the masks and stored the Swivls and,\nthrough various studies, discovered what had been obvious to any teacher\ntrying to connect through a screen: we hadn\u2019t gotten through. We\u2019d taught\nalmost nothing. It turns out you need full facial connection to teach. The\ntechnology solved one problem\u2014projecting my voice and some of my face\u2014but\nmasked the deeper dilemma: creating genuine empathy at a distance.\n\nYears later, still a high school teacher, I returned from winter break to an\nalarming problem. My most mediocre students were suddenly turning in adequate,\neven excellent essays. Those were the first heady days of ChatGPT, the new\nlarge-language-model artificial-intelligence programs. Much of the world\nmarvelled at the miracle, or fretted over existential issues, like whether\nthese super-sophisticated AIs would steal jobs or kill us all in their quest\nto manufacture paper clips. But high school teachers and students\u2014canaries in\nthe high-tech coal mine\u2014recognized the more modest threat and promise right\naway. AI, it turned out, was a great tool for cheating on your homework. Later\nthat month innovation officers at our schools assured us that ChatGPT and its\ncompetitors were really no different from calculators\u2014time-saving devices that\nproduce quick answers. What\u2019s 12,367 divided by 43? Compare and contrast the\nwritings of Primo Levi and Elie Wiesel: Why, in your opinion, did one take his\nlife while the other didn\u2019t? Plug and play. Once again, technology solved a\nproblem: it\u2019s midnight, and my essay is due first thing tomorrow, and I\nhaven\u2019t done any reading or research or thinking. But it masked the deeper\nissue. In an online world of quick takes and short videos, how do teachers\nfacilitate genuinely deep thoughts?\n\n### Teaching humans, it turns out, is a more complex endeavour involving\nrelationship, intimacy, face-to-face contact, irritation, passion, and love.\n\nAs I reflected on these problem-solving technologies\u2014Zoom with Swivl, and\nChatGPT\u2014it occurred to me they both would have \u201cworked\u201d if we\u2019d all been\nrobots. That is, if the goal were to transfer facts and ideas from the\nteachers to the students, Zoom and AI were the perfect tools. But teaching\nhumans, it turns out, is a more complex endeavour involving relationship,\nintimacy, face-to-face contact, irritation, passion, and love.\n\nI recalled my depressing experience with cutting-edge teaching technologies\nrecently when a friend sent me a copy of \u201cThe Techno-Optimist Manifesto,\u201d by\nmulti-billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen. The sixteen-page\ndocument is a stew of genuinely interesting insights, obvious and\nuninteresting thoughts, howlingly foolish ideas, and many clearly worrisome\nnotions. For example, the idea that there are only three sources of growth,\n\u201cpopulation growth, natural resource utilization, and technology,\u201d strikes me\nas true but also provocative. What exactly does he mean by growth? Are some\ngrowths better than others? On the other hand, the theory that \u201cproductivity\ngrowth causes prices to fall, supply to rise, and demand to expand\u201d is simply\nEcon 101, a class even I managed to pass my first year of college. The idea\nthat \u201chuman needs and desires are infinite\u201d is simple foolishness; we\u2019re not\ngoing to need or desire to be transformed into cockroaches or eat lead.\nGenuinely frightening is the claim \u201cWe believe any deceleration of AI will\ncost lives. Deaths that were preventable by the AI that was prevented from\nexisting is a form of murder.\u201d If citizens seeking to regulate \u201clifesaving\u201d AI\nare murderers, they should be severely punished, probably with death. There\u2019s\nan obvious authoritarian, even fascist, tone to these sentences. Get with the\nprogram or you\u2019ll be treated like a deadly criminal.\n\nFor me, the most striking quality of the document is the religious language.\nThe first sentence is \u201cWe are being lied to,\u201d introducing a kind of gnostic\nwisdom, where the forces of truth and light battle darkness and lies. The\nmanifesto is replete with \u201cwe believe\u201d statements\u2014altogether there are 113\u2014as\nif it\u2019s mimicking a Christian creed or Maimonides\u2019s thirteen principles of\nfaith. The author promiscuously utilizes transcendent words like \u201cinfinite,\u201d\n\u201cfar superior,\u201d \u201cglory,\u201d \u201cforever.\u201d It\u2019s not far-fetched to read the manifesto\nas a call to form a new religion, where the god is technology and the\ncommandments are to conquer nature, grow, and, above all, get out of the way\nwhile the elect develop new, infinitely adept technologies forever.\n\nFair enough. Anyone in America is free to create new religions, and as I said,\nnot everything in the manifesto is banal or foolish or dangerous. But, given\nmy profession, I was especially struck by the following claim: \u201cWe had a\nproblem of isolation, so we invented the Internet.\u201d The sentence is part of a\nlitany of problems technology has supposedly solved: cold with heat; heat with\nair conditioning; pandemics with vaccines; poverty with abundance. The\nblustering na\u00efvet\u00e9 in these claims is itself startling. Does the author really\nthink we\u2019ve solved poverty, or that air conditioning is really a solution to\nglobal warming? But nothing in this wildly hyperbolic document matches the\nboast about curing isolation. Technology solves loneliness. With the internet.\nAndreessen might contest the claim that social media is driving increased\nnumbers of suicides, or that a new generation is losing its sense of empathy\nbecause of the internet. But to insist that loneliness is a problem that can\nbe solved by more dependence on technological development flies in the face of\npretty much everyone\u2019s experience throughout the pandemic.\n\nFurthermore, is isolation as a subjective experience\u2014that is,\nloneliness\u2014something that even can and should be solved? In his classic essay\nThe Lonely Man of Faith, Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik begins with the words, \u201cThe\nnature of the dilemma can be stated in a three-word sentence. I am lonely.\u201d He\nquickly clarifies, \u201cI do not intend to convey to you the impression that I am\nalone.\u201d He has friends, family, colleagues, and students. But every so often,\nSoloveitchik admits, \u201cI feel rejected and thrust away.\u201d Oddly, though, he\nsays, \u201cI also feel invigorated because this very experience of loneliness\npresses everything in me into the service of God.\u201d The rest of the essay is a\nplea to embrace loneliness, but only as a dialectical balance to what he calls\n\u201cthe majestic.\u201d\n\nSoloveitchik focuses on the first two chapters of Genesis, noting the two\ncontradictory creation stories and suggesting that the Bible here offers two\ndistinct prototypes, what he refers to as Adam I and Adam II. Adam I is given\nthe imperative to conquer nature, to be \u201cfruitful and multiply, fill the earth\nand master it, and rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and the\nliving things that crawl on Earth.\u201d It\u2019s significant that Adam I is created\nsimultaneously with a partner; man and woman burst into being together. \u201cAdam\nthe first is never alone,\u201d Soloveitchik writes. \u201cMan in solitude has no\nopportunity to display his dignity and majesty, since both are behavioral\nsocial traits.\u201d It\u2019s Adam I, with his partners, who builds cities, creates\ngreat art, manufactures cars and airplanes, invents air conditioning and\nartificial intelligence. Since Adam I perpetually builds, creates, and\nconquers, he\u2019s never alone and never feels lonely. Adam I\u2019s deepest need is\nfor colleagues, not intimate companions.\n\nChapter 2 introduces us to Adam II, Contemplative Adam, the Lonely Man of\nFaith. This Adam is put on the earth not to conquer but to protect and care\nfor nature, symbolized by the garden of Eden. Unlike Adam I, Adam II is\ncreated alone. Soon he experiences loneliness, which the Bible characterizes\nas \u201cnot good.\u201d God attempts to solve the problem with a series of bumbling\ngestures, offering Adam various animals. But Adam isn\u2019t looking for mere\ncompany or acquaintances or for partners. He\u2019s not looking for colleagues. His\nexistential loneliness can only be eased through intimacy, and intimacy comes\nwith a cost. Adam falls into a deep sleep and loses a rib. For Soloveitchik,\nbecoming intimate \u201cis part of a redemptive gesture\u201d and \u201cmust also be\nsacrificial. . . . This new companionship is not attained through conquest,\nbut through surrender and retreat.\u201d In other words, isolation is not a problem\nto be solved, whether by the internet or by close partners or intimates. It\u2019s\nthe result of a deep need\u2014a yawning gap that makes us human. And it can only\nbe alleviated, not fixed.\n\nAstronauts in Martian Dust Storms by Paul DiMare, 1989.\n\nReading Andreessen\u2019s manifesto after reading Soloveitchik, one gets the sense\nthat Adam I\u2014Majestic Adam, Adam the conqueror, the dignified, the genius\nindustrial artist\u2014emerged whole from the skull of Silicon Valley. I imagine\nhim glaring with irritation at Adam II. The Majestic Adam yearns to tame and\nexploit the natural world, but Adam II, Contemplative Adam, prattles on about\nlimits, the trees we can\u2019t touch, the apple we can\u2019t eat. The techno-optimist\nsees elegant, magnificent cures in the tree bark, or technological solutions\nto hunger in the fruit, or shelter in the lumber, or energy from its burning\nbranches, or maybe even air conditioning. He immediately orients himself\ntoward ingenious exploitation. The techno-optimist is appalled by\nContemplative Adam\u2019s stubborn desire to regulate. From the techno-optimist\u2019s\nperspective, Adam I risks innocent lives by insisting on limits. Maybe, the\ntechno-optimist suggests, we should call Adam I what he is\u2014a murderer.\n\n### The religious response to modernity is not a despairing nihilism or a\ndemand for the return to a mythical Eden. It\u2019s a call to embrace the fullness\nof our humanity, both sides, our ambitions and our quiet prayers.\n\nBut Soloveitchik doesn\u2019t dismiss either Adam I or Adam II. For Soloveitchik,\nthese are two sides to the same human personality, two opposing inclinations,\ntwo feuding sensibilities. He urges the reader to \u201cembrace the dialectical\nburden\u201d\u2014that is, to internalize both Adams\u2014the Majestic and the Contemplative.\nTo be sure, Soloveitchik has an agenda. Modern humans in the West, he\nbelieves, have leaned too far toward technology\u2014as a source of both material\nadvancement and personal ambition. Even religious institutions, he writes, are\nfilled with ambitious personalities yearning for glory and success. But\nSoloveitchik\u2019s goal is not to obliterate Adam I. He just wants to reintroduce\nthe notion of sacrificial retreat, of contemplation, of redemptive defeat,\ninto our psyches. He opposes placing success at the pinnacle of human effort.\nHe makes the case for loneliness. His religious response to modernity is not a\ndespairing nihilism or a demand for the return to a mythical Eden. It\u2019s a call\nto embrace the fullness of our humanity, both sides, our ambitions and our\nquiet prayers.\n\nTherein lies the weakness of Andreessen\u2019s manifesto. For all its interest and\nits erudition, it ignores half of what it means to be human. Suppressing Adam\nII comes with a high cost. Even before its publication, much of our culture\nhad already heeded the commanding voice of \u201cThe Techno-Optimist Manifesto.\u201d We\nbecame drunk on technological solutions. We spoke to our screens, set up our\nSwivls, and expected genuine communication. But the internet only tricked us\ninto thinking it could overcome isolation. Modern, technologically savvy\nteachers, we presumed our students would learn. But no one was listening.\n\nGet Comment \u2192\n\n  * Date:\n\n    * May 2, 2024\n  * Topics:\n\n    * Culture,\n    * Public Life,\n    * Technology\n\n  * ### Phil Graubart\n\nPhil Graubart is a rabbi and writer living in San Diego, California.
