Here's how we know.\n\nEthan Siegel\n\nShare The scientific story behind the timeline of our Universe on Facebook\n\nShare The scientific story behind the timeline of our Universe on Twitter (X)\n\nShare The scientific story behind the timeline of our Universe on LinkedIn\n\nToday, it\u2019s now 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang occurred. Our observable\nUniverse extends for 46.1 billion light-years in all directions, and is made\nof:\n\n  * 68% dark energy,\n  * 27% dark matter,\n  * 4.9% normal (atom-based) matter,\n  * 0.09% neutrinos,\n  * and 0.01% radiation,\n\nwith no hint of other components like spatial curvature, cosmic strings,\ndomain walls, or any other weird stuff we can imagine.\n\nIf we were to run the clock backward, however, we\u2019d find that dark energy\nwasn\u2019t always dominant. There was a time when matter dominated, and before\nthat, when radiation did. There was a time when there were no stars, no\nneutral atoms, no atomic nuclei, no protons and neutrons, and even no massive\nparticles.\n\nBut how do we know precisely when these events and epochs occurred? That\u2019s\nwhat Marshall Randolph wants to know, asking:\n\n\u201cWhen I read about the epochs of the universe, they are tagged with a specific\ntime. The Hadron epoch, for example, started at 10^-6 seconds. The timelines\nof the epochs are given almost as if I should know them. Are they easily\ncalculated by physicists? Could you describe the methods in a way I can\nunderstand?\u201d\n\nI very much think so. Let\u2019s recount the cosmic story of how we came to be and\nhow we know precisely when those events happened.\n\nThe relative importance of different energy components in the Universe at\nvarious times in the past. Note that when dark energy reaches a number near\n100% in the future, the energy density of the Universe (and, therefore, the\nexpansion rate) will remain constant arbitrarily far ahead in time. Owing to\ndark energy, distant galaxies are already speeding up in their apparent\nrecession speed from us. Way off the scale of this diagram, to the left, is\nwhen the inflationary epoch ended and the hot Big Bang began. Dark energy\u2019s\nenergy density is ~123 orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical\nexpectation.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel\n\nIn the beginning \u2014 at least, as far back as we can trace things \u2014 the Universe\nwas inflating. That means it was expanding relentlessly, doubling in scale in\nall directions with each tiny fraction-of-a-second (something like 10^-35\nseconds) that goes by. After only a few hundred of those doublings, a tiny\nquantum fluctuation occurring on Planck scales, the smallest scale we can\ndescribe before the known laws of physics break down, gets stretched to scales\neven larger than the observable Universe. Because of this rapid expansion, the\nUniverse quickly empties; the only thing in it is empty space, and the large\namount of energy tied up in whatever quantum field caused inflation, plus the\nsmall amount of \u201cfluctuation energy\u201d arising from the stretched quantum\nfluctuations occurring on all scales.\n\nThen inflation ends, and that field energy gets converted into all the quanta\nwe know of. Particles and antiparticles of all types, including photons, get\nspontaneously created at very high energies and very large densities. They\u2019re\nalmost uniformly distributed, with an average \u201coverdense\u201d region and an\naverage \u201cunderdense\u201d region departing from the average density by just one\npart in ~30,000 or so. From this point on, the Universe always expands, cools,\nand gravitates, and all sorts of events in the evolutionary history of our\nUniverse occur.\n\nHow matter (top), radiation (middle), and dark energy (bottom) all evolve with\ntime in an expanding Universe. As the Universe expands, the matter density\ndilutes, but the radiation also becomes cooler as its wavelengths get\nstretched to longer, less energetic states. Dark energy\u2019s density, on the\nother hand, will truly remain constant if it behaves as is currently thought:\nas a form of energy intrinsic to space itself. These three components,\ntogether, dictate how the Universe expands at all times from the Big Bang\nuntil the present day and beyond.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel/Beyond The Galaxy\n\nAt the start, these quanta all collide with one another at tremendous rates:\nquadrillions of times per second. They\u2019re all massless, so they\u2019re all moving\nat the speed of light, possessing very large amounts of energy. But as the\nUniverse expands, it also cools: remember that all particles, massive or\nmassless, can be described by a wave as well, and the wavelength of any wave\ndetermines its energy. As the Universe expands, the wavelength of all waves\nget stretched, meaning they lose energy and the temperature of the Universe\ndrops.\n\nAt some point:\n\n  * the Universe cools enough so that the shortest-lived, most unstable particles and antiparticles begin decaying,\n  * the Higgs and electroweak symmetries break, giving rise to rest mass and separating the weak and electromagnetic forces,\n  * the quarks-and-antiquarks and gluons, previously free particles, become grouped into protons, neutrons, and other bound states known as hadrons,\n  * the antimatter annihilates away with most of the matter, creating a great bath of radiation and just a small population of excess matter,\n  * nuclear fusion can occur without composite nuclei immediately being blasted apart,\n  * matter overtakes radiation as the dominant component of the Universe,\n  * neutral atoms can stably form, giving rise to a Universe that\u2019s now transparent to visible light,\n  * the first stars form, paving the way for the era of stars and galaxies,\n  * and then dark energy overtakes matter as the dominant component of the Universe, ensuring our cosmic fate to be driven away from all unbound galaxies and groups/clusters of galaxies.\n\nThat\u2019s a very rough outline of the history of the Universe.\n\nThis artist\u2019s conception shows a logarithmic view of the observable Universe.\nThe Solar System gives way to the Milky Way, which gives way to nearby\ngalaxies which then give way to the large-scale structure and the hot, dense\nplasma of the Big Bang at the outskirts. If we were to shrink the Sun down to\na grain of sand, then the observable Universe would only be a little over a\nhundred billion kilometers in radius, containing around 2 sextillion \u201cgrains\nof sand\u201d (stars) strewn across that enormous volume.\n\nCredit: Pablo Carlos Budassi\n\nNow for the big question: how can we determine when all of these things\nhappen?\n\nThe way we normally do this is straightforward \u2014 at least conceptually \u2014 even\nif the mathematics itself is a little difficult. Where we start is by\nrecognizing the following three things:\n\n  1. The Universe presently has a \u201cbath\u201d of background radiation that\u2019s left over from the Big Bang, with an average temperature, today, of 2.7255 K.\n  2. The Universe presently has a specific \u201csize\u201d or \u201cscale\u201d to it, which we believe is very close to 46.1 billion light-years in radius, but which we can just call \u201cthe size today.\u201d\n  3. And that, because the Universe is continuously expanding and cooling, it was smaller and hotter and denser in the past, and we can determine \u201cHow hot was it?\u201d at any point in time simply by recognizing that if you take the temperature today and divide it by the ratio of \u201cthe scale of the Universe back then\u201d to \u201cthe scale of the Universe today,\u201d you\u2019ll get the temperature of the Universe back at any epoch you desire.\n\nTherefore, if you know either:\n\n  * what was the temperature/energy at which this specific event-or-transition occurred,\n  * or what was the scale, relative to today\u2019s scale, at which this specific event-or-transition occurred,\n\nyou can do the math to figure out precisely when, in terms of our cosmic\nhistory, these events and eras took place.\n\nA visual history of the expanding Universe includes the hot, dense state known\nas the Big Bang and the growth and formation of structure subsequently. The\nfull suite of data, including the observations of the light elements and the\ncosmic microwave background, leaves only the Big Bang as a valid explanation\nfor all we see. As the Universe expands, it also cools, enabling ions, neutral\natoms, and eventually molecules, gas clouds, stars, and finally galaxies to\nform. Without the Higgs giving mass to the particles in the Universe at a very\nearly, hot stage, none of this would have been possible.\n\nCredit: NASA/CXC/M. Weiss\n\nFiguring out either temperature/energy or relative scale at which certain\nevents occurred is relatively straightforward. For events that occur in the\ncontext of particle/high-energy physics, we simply need to look to our\nexperimental data to figure out at what energy/temperature they occur at. For\nevents that occur throughout the history of the Universe, these can either be\nmeasured or calculated using one of two straightforward methods.\n\n  1. For events that can be determined observationally, we can measure the redshift at which they occur/exist, by comparing the observed emission/absorption lines generated by atomic or molecular transitions with the same lines generated by that same molecule or atom within the lab. The ratio of observed-to-rest-frame wavelength equals the ratio of \u201cthe scale of the Universe back then\u201d to \u201cthe scale of the Universe today,\u201d and that ratio, minus the number 1, is the definition of redshift.\n  2. For events that can occurred at some point in the Universe\u2019s past, we can calculate \u201cWhat was the scale of the Universe back then?\u201d simply by numerically integrating the equation that governs how the Universe expands over time: the first Friedmann equation.\n\nA photo of Ethan Siegel at the American Astronomical Society\u2019s hyperwall in\n2017, along with the first Friedmann equation at right. The first Friedmann\nequation details the Hubble expansion rate squared on the left hand side,\nwhich governs the evolution of spacetime. The right side includes all the\ndifferent forms of matter and energy, along with spatial curvature (in the\nfinal term), which determines how the Universe evolves in the future. This has\nbeen called the most important equation in all of cosmology and was derived by\nFriedmann in essentially its modern form back in 1922.\n\nCredit: Harley Thronson (photograph) and Perimeter Institute (composition)\n\nIf you can figure out what the Universe\u2019s scale factor was when a specific\ntransition occurred, then you can do a little math to determine \u201cAt what time\nin the Universe\u2019s history was the Universe this specific size/scale?\u201d Again,\nthis requires some numerical integration, but there\u2019s a short-cut you can use\nthat works pretty well for the first few billion years of our cosmic history:\nassuming the Universe was either made 100% out of radiation (which works for\nthe first ~10,000 years), or assuming that the Universe was made 100% out of\nmatter (which works for the next ~7 billion years).\n\nThe short-cut is as follows.\n\n  * If your Universe is made 100% of radiation, then it expands according to a simple rule: the scale factor grows with time as a ~ t^1\u20442.\n  * If your Universe is made 100% of matter, then it expands according to a simple rule: the scale factor grows with time as a ~ t^2\u20443.\n  * And if your Universe is made 100% of dark energy, which dominates the expansion at late (modern) times, the scale factor grows exponentially: as a ~ e^Ht.\n\nIf we fill in the in-between stages, or just calculate the whole thing\ndirectly without using short-cuts, we can determine the scale/size of the\nUniverse as a function of cosmic time.\n\nThe scale of the Universe (y-axis) versus the age of the Universe (x-axis) on\nlogarithmic scales. Some size and time milestones are marked, as appropriate.\nEverything contained within the entire observable Universe was once contained\nin a very small volume, as shown by the size scale on the y-axis.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel\n\nThat\u2019s it, as long as you realize\n\n  * that the ratio of the scale of the Universe at any time to the scale of the Universe today\n\nis equal to\n\n  * the temperature of the Universe at any time to the temperature of the Universe today,\n\nyou can calculate at what time any event occurs if you know either how big the\nUniverse was at that time relative to today or you know what the temperature\nof the Universe was at that time relative to today.\n\nWith that said, all we need to remember is that the temperature of the\nUniverse, today, is 2.725 K, and that the size/scale/redshift of the Universe\ntoday is 46.1 billion light-years/defined as 1/defined as 0, and also that the\nage of the Universe, today, is 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. As long\nas you start with today\u2019s composition of the Universe \u2014 68% dark energy, 31.9%\nmatter, 0.09% neutrinos and 0.01% photons \u2014 and you recognize that everything\nbehaves as radiation when it moves at or very close to the speed of light, you\ncan\u2019t go wrong.\n\nWith that said, here is a summary of the various eras/epochs, from the\nearliest moments we can speak of until the present day.\n\nThe quantum fluctuations inherent to space, stretched across the Universe\nduring cosmic inflation, gave rise to the density fluctuations imprinted in\nthe cosmic microwave background, which in turn gave rise to the stars,\ngalaxies, and other large-scale structures in the Universe today. This is the\nbest picture we have of how the entire Universe behaves, where inflation\nprecedes and sets up the Big Bang. Unfortunately, we can only access the\ninformation contained inside our cosmic horizon, which is all part of the same\nfraction of one region where inflation ended some 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel; ESA/Planck and the DOE/NASA/NSF Interagency Task Force on\nCMB research\n\nInflationary era: This is a tricky one, but only in the sense that we don\u2019t\nknow when, how, or even if it had a beginning, but we do know that it lasted\nat least some ~10^-33 seconds, and that when it ended, the hot Big Bang began.\n\nFree, unbound, massless particle-and-antiparticle era: This is what you might\nthink of as the Universe\u2019s \u201cprimordial soup,\u201d where every possible collision\nthat you can imagine occurs in great abundance. There are no bound structures;\nthere are no stable configurations; any particle that you can track likely\ngets annihilated and transforms into other particles many, many times over.\nThis lasts from the end of inflation right up until the Universe is about\n~10^-10 seconds old, or ~100 picoseconds.\n\nMassive particle-and-antiparticle/quark gluon plasma era: After about the\nfirst ~10^-10 seconds, the Higgs and electroweak symmetries break, separating\nthe electroweak force into the electromagnetic and weak forces, and giving\nmass to the Universe. This transition is also the final opportunity for the\nUniverse to create a matter-antimatter asymmetry; if it hasn\u2019t happened before\nnow, this is its last opportunity. As it expands and cools, the heavier\nquarks-and-antiquarks decay away, as do the tau-antitau lepton pairs. This\ncontinues until the Universe is about one microsecond (~10^-6 seconds) old,\nwhen the next major transition happens.\n\nIn the very early Universe, there were tremendous numbers of quarks, leptons,\nantiquarks, and antileptons of all species. After only a tiny fraction-of-a-\nsecond has elapsed since the hot Big Bang, most of these matter-antimatter\npairs annihilate away, leaving a very tiny excess of matter over antimatter.\nHow that excess came about is a puzzle known as baryogenesis, and is one of\nthe greatest unsolved problems in modern physics.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel/Beyond the Galaxy\n\nHadron era: Prior to this point, quarks-and-antiquarks and gluons were still\nin a primordial soup: the quarks-and-antiquarks had masses, but wouldn\u2019t form\nbound states, as the energies and densities were too great. But now, groups of\nthree quarks form baryons like protons and neutrons, groups of three\nantiquarks form anti-baryons, and quark-antiquark pairs form mesons. All of\nthe mesons are unstable, and decay quite quickly, while the remaining anti-\nbaryons all get annihilated away by baryons, producing an enormous bath of\nradiation. At the end, there are a whopping ~1 billion photons left over for\nevery baryon, but no surviving antibaryons. This lasts until the Universe is\nabout 1 second old, and a handy rule-of-thumb is that an age of ~1 second\ncorresponds to an average energy-per-particle of 1 MeV, or a temperature of\n~10^10 K: ten billion degrees.\n\nTravel the Universe with astrophysicist Ethan Siegel. Subscribers will get the\nnewsletter every Saturday. All aboard!\n\nNuclear era: At an age of ~1 second, neutrinos stop interacting regularly with\nthe remaining particles and antiparticles in the Universe, and almost\nimmediately after, the remaining positrons annihilate with a huge excess of\nelectrons, producing even greater numbers of photons, and heating them so\nthey\u2019re slightly hotter (by about 40%) than the neutrinos. Nuclear fusion is\nattempting to occur between protons and neutrons, but the photons blast them\napart until the Universe reaches about ~3 minutes of age. At last, now that\nit\u2019s cool enough, nuclear fusion occurs, forming deuterium, tritium, helium-3,\nhelium-4, and both lithium-7 and beryllium-7. By the time the Universe is\nabout 4-to-20 minutes old, all of this is done.\n\nA Universe where electrons and protons are free and collide with photons,\ntransitions to a neutral one that\u2019s transparent to photons as the Universe\nexpands and cools. Shown here is the ionized plasma (left) before the CMB is\nemitted, followed by the transition to a neutral Universe (right) that\u2019s\ntransparent to photons. It\u2019s the spectacular two-photon transition in a\nhydrogen atom which enables the Universe to become neutral exactly as we\nobserve it.\n\nCredit: Amanda Yoho for Starts With A Bang\n\nPlasma era: It\u2019s now too cold and too sparse for fusion reactions to occur,\nand all of the tritium decays to helium-3 while all of the beryllium-7 decays\nto lithium-7. Protons and the other atomic nuclei would love to bind together\nto electrons, but they can\u2019t without getting immediately blasted apart by a\nhigh-energy photon. At an age of about ~9,000 years, radiation quits being the\ndominant component of the Universe, replaced by the combination of normal-and-\ndark matter. This lasts until the Universe reaches an age of about 380,000\nyears, and a temperature of merely ~3000 K.\n\nAtomic era: At last, at this point, 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the\nUniverse forms neutral atoms, and is now transparent to light, including the\nradiation left over from the Big Bang. But because the densest overdense\nregions and the least-dense underdense regions are still so close to the\ncosmic average, it takes time for gravitation to collapse these atoms down to\nwhere they can form stars. Although the exact number isn\u2019t yet known, we can\nballpark it to last until the first stars form, say, 100 million years after\nthe Big Bang.\n\nStellar-and-galactic era: Beginning roughly 100 million years after the Big\nBang, now \u201cLet there be light\u201d has officially occurred for the second time:\nwith the birth of stars and star clusters. These will grow and merge into\ngalaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters, and will align along great cosmic\nwalls, eventually forming the modern cosmic web.\n\nOver time, gravitational interactions will turn a mostly uniform, equal-\ndensity Universe into one with large concentrations of matter and huge voids\nseparating them. For as long as radiation is still important, exerting an\noutward pressure even once the Universe becomes matter-dominated, the growth\nof matter imperfections is very small.\n\nCredit: Volker Springel/MPE\n\nAlthough this process persists far into the future, we\u2019ve already entered the\nfinal one: the one that describes our Universe now and will describe our\nUniverse for all-time afterward.\n\nThe dark energy era: There are two ways to define its onset, depending on\nwhether you define \u201cdark energy dominates the Universe\u201d as talking about\n\n  * when the recession speed of a distant galaxy stops slowing down and starts speeding up,\n  * or when dark energy becomes the dominant form of energy in the Universe, overtaking matter.\n\nBy the first definition, dark energy dominates the expansion rate of the\nUniverse at an age of 7.8 billion years after the Big Bang. By the second\ndefinition, that domination is delayed until the Universe is 10.4 billion\nyears after the Big Bang. Right at the same time that the first photosynthetic\norganisms evolve on Earth, dark energy passes both dark matter and normal\nmatter combined to dominate the energy content of the Universe.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the way it will be, forever and ever into the future, at least to\nthe best of our knowledge. This timeline can be made more-or-less granular,\nbut that\u2019s how we know it and how we figure it out!\n\nEthan is on medical leave until May 6th.
