Most networks are currently safe, but\nmany service providers are due to implement the flawed compression technology.\n\nThe new compression technique, called variable bitrate compression produces\ndifferent size packets of data for different sounds.\n\nThat happens because the sampling rate is kept high for long complex sounds\nlike \"ow\", but cut down for simple consonants like \"c\". This variable method\nsaves on bandwidth, while maintaining sound quality.\n\nVoIP streams are encrypted to prevent eavesdropping. However, a team from\nJohns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, US, has shown that simply\nmeasuring the size of packets without decoding them can identify whole words\nand phrases with a high rate of accuracy.\n\nVoIP systems accessed via a computer like Skype have become popular in recent\nyears, and internet-based phone systems are increasingly appearing in homes\nand offices too to connect conventional telephones.\n\n##### Matching packets\n\nOnly a few services currently employ the vulnerable compression method, but\nmore networks had hoped to include it in future VoIP upgrades, says Charles\nWright, a member of the Johns Hopkins team. \"We hope we have caught this\nthreat before it becomes too serious.\"\n\nEavesdropping software the team has developed cannot yet decode an entire\nconversation, but it can search for chosen phrases within the encrypted data.\nThis could still allow a criminal to find important financial information\nconveyed in the call, says Fabian Monrose, another team member.\n\nThe software breaks down a typed phrase to be listened for into its\nconstituent sounds using a phonetic dictionary. A version of the phrase is\nthen pasted together from audio clips of phonemes taken from a library of\nexample conversations, before finally being made into a stream of VoIP-style\npackets.\n\nThat gives an idea of what the phrase would look like in a real VoIP stream.\nWhen a close match is found in a real call, the software alerts the\neavesdropper.\n\n##### Jargon catcher\n\nIn tests on example conversations, the software correctly identified phrases\nwith an average accuracy of about 50%. But that jumped to 90% for longer, more\ncomplicated words.\n\nWright thinks these phrases may be the most important. \"I think the attack is\nmuch more of a threat to calls with some sort of professional jargon where you\nhave lots of big words that string together to make long, relatively\npredictable phrases,\" he says. \"Informal conversational speech would be\ntougher because it's so much more random.\"\n\nPhilip Zimmermann, the founder of the Zfone VoIP security project, says the\ncompression schemes may not be a good idea for internet phone applications.\n\n\"I'd suggest looking for other alternatives,\" he says. VoIP providers could\nsolve the problem by padding out the data packets to an equal length, he adds,\nalthough this would reduce the extent of the compression.\n\nA paper on the Johns Hopkins team's work was presented at the 2008 IEEE\nSymposium on Security and Privacy, in Oakland, California, US, last month.\n\nComputer Viruses - Learn more about the threats to your PC in our\ncomprehensive special report.\n\nThere are 16 comments on 3 pages 1 | 2 | 3 | Next | Most Recent | See all\n\nVIEW THREAD >>\n\n## Add Randomness\n\nBy Lucidobscurity\n\nThu Jun 12 23:08:52 BST 2008\n\nThis really seems kind of silly to me since every other telephone technology\ncan be easily tapped. VoIP is the first to be encrypted for average users.\n\nThe simple solution to this problem is similar to what was suggested, but\ninstead of padding all packets and severly reducing compression, randomly pad\npackets and pad them random amounts. This will reduce compression, but if you\nonly add just enough random padding to thwart interpretation based on size\nthen you can still get most of the advantages of the compression\n\nREPORT | REPLY\n\n## Add Randomness\n\nBy Harpoon\n\nMon Jun 23 22:25:41 BST 2008\n\nIt's not the same as home telephone tapping - you can't easily scan and index\nhome telephones for catch words or phrases. Because of VoIP variable bit\ncompression, you can. So easily that an attacker can simply sit back and wait\nfor the word he's looking for to alert him.\n\nREPORT | REPLY\n\nVIEW THREAD >>\n\nVIEW THREAD >>\n\n## At Least Prince Charles Will Be Safe\n\nBy Charles\n\nThu Jun 12 23:41:27 BST 2008\n\nSo, no more embarrassing eavesdropping on HRH's phone calls. His family\npronounce words completely differently from the rest of us, so they should be\nsafe.\n\nREPORT | REPLY\n\nVIEW THREAD >>\n\n## Packet Length\n\nBy Bob\n\nFri Jun 13 15:49:22 BST 2008\n\nCompression doesn't come from having shorter packets, but from sending less\ndata down the line regardless of packet size. There is no reason that a buffer\ncan't be set up to send out packets of identical size regardless of the word\nspoken. The time it takes to buffer 1400 bytes of audio data isn't going to be\nperceptible to a human.\n\nREPORT | REPLY\n\n## Packet Length\n\nBy Steve\n\nFri Jun 13 18:55:33 BST 2008\n\nThey're sending packets at a constant rate and variable length. For the sake\nof illustration, let's pretend this is somewhat like AM. Your suggestion\ncreates packets of constant length at a variable rate... Fm. It's doubtful\nthat they'd find it very difficult to modify their program for this minor\nadjustment...\n\nREPORT | REPLY\n\nVIEW THREAD >>\n\nThere are 16 comments on 3 pages 1 | 2 | 3 | Next | Most Recent | See all\n\nAll comments should respect the New Scientist House Rules.
