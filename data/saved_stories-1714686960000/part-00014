Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were exasperated with\nUnitedHealth. At one point, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) held up a fifth-edition\ncopy of \u201cHacking for Dummies\u201d during the hearing.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is some basic stuff that was missed,\u201d he said, referring to the fact\nthat the hackers gained access to a Change server that didn\u2019t have multi-\nfactor authentication, a big problem for a company whose business is digital\ndata. \u201cSo shame on internal audit, external audit and your system folks, those\ntasked with redundancy, they\u2019re not doing their job. And as a result, we have\na data breach.\u201d\n\nSTAT+ Exclusive Story\n\nAlready have an account?
