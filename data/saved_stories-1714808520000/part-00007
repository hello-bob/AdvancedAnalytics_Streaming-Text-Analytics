Exposure to these pollutants\nincreases the risk of childhood asthma, pre-term births, heart disease and\nstroke. Children, elderly and pregnant people are especially vulnerable to\ntraffic-related air pollution.\n\nThe report findings show that these mega-warehouses are largely concentrated\nin communities of color. Hispanic, Black and low-income people live near\nwarehouses at rates that are 195%, 137% and 125% more likely, respectively,\nthan would be expected from statewide demographics.\n\n\u201cTransportation systems are set up in a way that adversely affects communities\nof color and low-income communities,\u201d said Cesunica Ivey, assistant professor\nof civil and environmental engineering at the University of California\nBerkeley.\n\nPeople of color are more than twice as likely as white people to live in areas\nwith failing air quality. Decades of discriminatory practices known as\n\u201credlining\u201d made way for zoning laws that permitted placing highways,\nindustrial facilities and major shipping hubs in and around communities of\ncolor.\n\n\u201cWe built this economy where we rely so heavily on moving goods,\u201d said Jose\nAcosta-Cordova, transportation justice program manager at the Chicago-based\nLittle Village Environmental Justice Organization. \u201cBut the reality is that\nthese facilities are killing our communities.\u201d\n\nMany warehouses across Illinois rely on low-wage temporary workers, 85% of\nwhom are Black and Hispanic.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Down to Earth\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe planet's most important stories.

If passed, it would also ensure that new warehouses install\ncharging infrastructure that would support electric delivery vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe need to target the rollout of electric heavy-duty trucks in communities\nthat are adversely impacted,\u201d said Regan Patterson, assistant professor of\ncivil and environmental engineering at UCLA. \u201cIncrease in warehouses is not\nonly happening in one area, but nationally it\u2019s continuing to replicate the\nsame racial and socio-economic patterns of disparity.\u201d\n\nPast EDF research has shown that roughly 15m people across 10 US states, and\none in four people in New York state, live within a half-mile of a warehouse.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US news\n  * America's dirty divide\n  * Pollution\n  * Illinois\n  * E-commerce\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
