The information comes from a document called Dietary Guidelines for\nAmericans 2020-2025, and it lists out the following for a healthy eating plan:\nan emphasis on grains, produce, and fat-free and low-fat milk products, foods\nthat are low in saturated fats, and a variety of protein such as beans,\npoultry, and lean meat. Saturated fat is discouraged by public health\norganizations and just about every mainstream expert you'll encounter. But\nwe're quickly learning how useless this information may be.\n\n## American Heart Association Was Paid off by Procter & Gamble to Say Heart\nDisease Was Caused by Saturated Fat, Not Seed Oils and Sugar\n\nIt's been hammered into us for years that saturated fat is a scary type of\nfood that we should avoid for the most part. Things like butter, eggs, and red\nmeat need to be eaten in moderation\u2014or better yet, not at all\u2014according to\npublic health organizations. But science journalist and author Nina Teicholz\nis one of many writers and health enthusiasts who is helping to pull back the\nveil on this belief and make everyday people understand that saturated fat\nisn't the devil.\n\n\"Do saturated fats cause heart disease? The science was always weak,\" Teicholz\ntweets. \"Fear of these fats was started by American Heart Assoc. in 1961 based\non a flawed study.\"\n\nShe shares an article from a journal called Endocrinology, Diabetes and\nObesity that reviews the history of \"the diet-heart hypothesis from the late\n1950s up to the current day,\" including revelations that were never published\nbefore in scientific literature. The American Heart Association, the nation's\nlargest nonprofit organization that is considered the leading voice when it\ncomes to heart disease education and awareness, started recommending in 1961\nthat people avoid saturated fat and replace it with polyunsaturated vegetable\noils, such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, etc.\n\n\"The 1961 AHA advice to limit saturated fat is arguably the single-most\ninfluential nutrition policy ever published, as it came to be adopted first by\nthe U.S. government, as official policy for all Americans, in 1980, and then\nby governments around the world as well as the World Health Organization,\" the\narticle reads.\n\nHowever, they were paid off to distribute this information. The AHA accepted\n$20 million (in today's dollars) in funding from Procter & Gamble, a\ncorporation that conveniently makes and sells Crisco Oil. The AHA recommended\nthat everyone replace butter with \"heart healthy\" alternatives like vegetable\noil or Crisco Oil.\n\nView post on Twitter\n\n\"Despite Heart Assoc advice, the original 'core' clinical trials on saturated\nfats, from the 60s and 70s, could not find an effect of these fats on\ncardiovascular mortality, total mortality, and for the most part heart attacks\nor other 'events [sic],'\" Teicholz tweets. \"Results from these trials, other\nstudies on sat fats were ignored, suppressed. Eg, the famous Framingham study\ncouldn't find any link between sat fats and heart disease. This govt-funded\nresult was never published. Another major study w/ contrary results not\npublished for 17y [sic].\"\n\nIt wasn't until the late 2000s that scientists and journalists started to re-\nexamine saturated fats and restructure the way people talked about butter,\nmeat, and eggs in relation to overall health and wellness. Teicholz points out\nthat the 2020 Dietary Guidelines expert committee \"found that 88% of studies\nin their own review did not support\" the idea that heart disease was caused by\nsaturated fat. And yet the committee ignored this data and claimed \"the\nevidence against saturated fat was 'strong.'\"\n\nView post on Twitter\n\nTeicholz also reminds us that cutting out saturated fat can actually do the\nbody harm, \"because you will cut out foods that contain the key nutrients\nneeded for maintaining health and having healthy children.\"\n\n\"It's sobering to realize that US policy to cut saturated fats was created for\nmiddle-aged men fearful of heart disease,\" she concludes. \"Never considered\nthe potential harms to women, children. US policy on sat fats never weighed\ncosts vs. benefits and has never reflected the science.\"\n\nIt's no wonder more people than ever are skeptical of public health\norganizations and mainstream experts who claim to possess the final word on\nhealth and nutrition, when there is so much proof that information has been\ncensored and even doctored in order to push a certain message that will help\ncorporations like Procter & Gamble become richer and richer.\n\n### Discover\n\nHealthBeautyStyleRelationshipsLivingCultureNews\n\n### About\n\nAdvertiseContact UsPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceCopyright\n\n### Print Edition\n\nCurrent Issue\n\n### The Glance\n\nSign-up\n\n### Social\n\nInstagramFacebookPinterestTwitterRSS\n\n\u00a9 2024 EvieMagazine.com\n\n", "frontpage": true}
