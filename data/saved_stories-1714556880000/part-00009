Some people\nspeculate that it may be a secret test version of OpenAI's upcoming GPT-4.5 or\nGPT-5 large language model (LLM). The paid version of ChatGPT is currently\npowered by GPT-4 Turbo.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nTuring test on steroids: Chatbot Arena crowdsources ratings for 45 AI models\n\nCurrently, the new model is only available for use through the Chatbot Arena\nwebsite, although in a limited way. In the site's \"side-by-side\" arena mode\nwhere users can purposely select the model, gpt2-chatbot has a rate limit of\neight queries per day\u2014dramatically limiting people's ability to test it in\ndetail.\n\nSo far, gpt2-chatbot has inspired plenty of rumors online, including that it\ncould be the stealth launch of a test version of GPT-4.5 or even GPT-5\u2014or\nperhaps a new version of 2019's GPT-2 that has been trained using new\ntechniques. We reached out to OpenAI for comment but did not receive a\nresponse by press time. On Monday evening, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seemingly\ndropped a hint by tweeting, \"i do have a soft spot for gpt2.\"\n\nEnlarge / A screenshot of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena \"side-by-side\" page showing\n\"gpt2-chatbot\" listed among the models for testing. (Red highlight added by\nArs Technica.)\n\nBenj Edwards\n\nEarly reports of the model first appeared on 4chan, then spread to social\nmedia platforms like X, with hype following not far behind. \"Not only does it\nseem to show incredible reasoning, but it also gets notoriously challenging AI\nquestions right with a much more impressive tone,\" wrote AI developer Pietro\nSchirano on X. Soon, threads on Reddit popped up claiming that the new model\nhad amazing abilities that beat every other LLM on the Arena.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the rumors, we decided to try out the new model for ourselves but\ndid not come away impressed. When asked about \"Benj Edwards,\" the model\nrevealed a few mistakes and some awkward language compared to GPT-4 Turbo's\noutput. A request for five original dad jokes fell short. And the gpt2-chatbot\ndid not decisively pass our \"magenta\" test.

We've seen other people reach the\nsame conclusion after further testing, saying that the new mystery chatbot\ndoesn't seem to represent a large capability leap beyond GPT-4. \"Gpt2-chatbot\nis good. really good,\" wrote HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer on X. \"But if this is\ngpt-4.5, I\u2019m disappointed.\"\n\nStill, OpenAI's fingerprints seem to be all over the new bot. \"I think it may\nwell be an OpenAI stealth preview of something,\" AI researcher Simon Willison\ntold Ars Technica. But what \"gpt2\" is exactly, he doesn't know. After\nsurveying online speculation, it seems that no one apart from its creator\nknows precisely what the model is, either.\n\nWillison has uncovered the system prompt for the AI model, which claims it is\nbased on GPT-4 and made by OpenAI. But as Willison noted in a tweet, that's no\nguarantee of provenance because \"the goal of a system prompt is to influence\nthe model to behave in certain ways, not to give it truthful information about\nitself.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n21\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
