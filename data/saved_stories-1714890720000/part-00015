(Photo/ Rick Wicker)\n\nIn the world of paleontology, there are few moments that can match the\nelectric thrill of an exceptional find \u2014 especially a find that holds the\npower to reshape our understanding of the history of life on Earth. For Dr.\nTyler Lyson and his team, such a moment came in 2016 at Corral Bluffs near\nColorado Springs. Their exhilarating discovery \u2014 a remarkably complete mammal\nskull, dating back 65 million years, only a few thousand years after the\ndinosaurs walked the Earth \u2014 would not only change the course of their\nresearch but also lay the groundwork for the largest research grant ever\nreceived by the Denver Museum of Nature & Science in the summer of 2023.\n\nThe discoveries at Corral Bluffs ultimately paved the way for the Denver\nMuseum of Nature & Science to receive a prestigious collaborative research\ngrant from the National Science Foundation's Frontier Research in Earth\nSciences program. The nearly $3 million collaborative research grant, led by\nthe Museum with a portion over $1,280,000, is the largest research grant ever\nreceived by the Museum.\n\nRead more: Denver Museum Of Nature & Science Receives Its Largest Research\nGrant Ever From The National Science Foundation\n\nTyler Lyson and Ian Miller examine a fossil bearing concretion.

Laughter and cheers erupted while high fives flew, the joy and\nexcitement rising above the dust of the broken rocks.\n\nThe team \u2014 which included Dr. Ian Miller, geologist Ken Weissenburger and\nMuseum volunteer Sharon Milito \u2014 had unearthed more than just a fossil: they\nhad discovered the first of many clues that will help scientists to unlock the\nsecrets behind the rise of mammals. The fossils at Corral Bluffs provide a\nguide for understanding the origins of how and when modern ecosystems\nrebounded after the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction that wiped out\nthe giant dinosaurs.\n\nRelated: Giant gar found directly above the K/Pg boundary suggests healthy\nfreshwater ecosystems existed within thousands of years of the asteroid\nimpact, not millions.\n\nAeon Way-Smith and Laurel Butterworth excavate a plant quarry at Corral Bluffs\nin 2017.

Coming to the Museum, Dr. Lyson\nwanted to answer important scientific questions, and one of the biggest\nunanswered questions was what happened in the first 1 million years after the\ngiant dinosaurs went extinct. To find answers he would need to find complete\nfossils from this critical interval of time. But at first, he didn\u2019t know\nexactly where to look.\n\n\u201cWe were looking at geological maps of Bolivia, Argentina and other places\naround the world. But we thought, \u2018well, we should probably look in our\nbackyard before we spend a lot of money going somewhere halfway across the\nplanet.\u2019 And funnily enough, we ended up making the big discovery right here\nin Colorado, within the city limits of Colorado Springs,\u201d said Dr. Lyson.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy because you never think these big discoveries are going to happen\nin your own backyard.\u201d\n\nInterns Eldon Panigot and Emily Burns work alongside postdoctoral scholar\nHolger Petermann at Corral Bluffs. (Photo/ Rick Wicker)\n\nDr. Lyson said the key to finding fossils at Corral Bluffs was looking for\nconcretions, a special type of rock that forms around fossils. Dr. Lyson\ncompared finding the fossils inside concretions to \u201copening an oyster shell to\nfind a pearl.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we started uncovering mammal fossils at Corral Bluffs, it was like going\nto the optometrist and the slide flipped on and everything came into focus,\u201d\nsaid Dr. Lyson. \u201cSuddenly, it was game on, and we knew exactly what to look\nfor. All we had to do was find these special concretions, crack them open, and\nsee what amazing fossils were inside.\u201d\n\nAfter finding the Carsioptychus, within a matter of minutes, the team found\nmore mammal skulls belonging to different species. From there, the scientists\nused different methods to date the rocks in which the fossils were found,\nmaking it possible to track how and when species and ecosystems recovered from\nthe extinction event. The site's unique preservation of diverse species \u2014 both\nplants and animals \u2014 afforded a rare glimpse into past ecosystems immediately\nbefore and after the asteroid hit Earth that caused the K/Pg mass extinction\n66 million years ago. Here roughly 75% of all species on Earth went extinct in\na geologic instant.\n\nResearchers examine preliminary Computed Tomography results of a Corral Bluffs\nfossil at the Northglenn Veterinary Hospital.

The fossils found in Corral Bluff, dating back\nto the aftermath of the K/Pg mass extinction, represent a natural laboratory\nwhere ecosystem reorganization can be studied in higher resolution than ever\nbefore.\n\nDr. Lyson said the NSF grant will allow the Museum to pull together \u201cmore\npeople to do more science.\u201d Now, he\u2019s building out the team with people coming\ntogether with different skills sets, such as digital fossil preparators,\nmechanical preparators, geochemists, paleobotanists, geochronologists and\nvertebrate paleontologists specializing in mammals, turtles and crocodilians.\nThe research grant includes 12 scientists from several collaborating\ninstitutions, including Brooklyn College - City University of New York,\nCollege of Charleston, Colorado College, Smithsonian National Museum of\nNatural History, University of British Columbia, University of Colorado\nBoulder, University of Oregon and University of Wyoming.\n\nWith this significant financial boost, this multidisciplinary team of\nscientists will dig into the rocky soil of our planet's history to answer\nimportant, unanswered questions about how life rebounded after Earth\u2019s darkest\nhour.\n\n## Winter 2024\n\n### In This Edition\n\n  * #### Living with the Enemy\n\nThe Peculiar Life History of an Ant-Eating Spider\n\n  * #### Uncovering the Mysteries of Mammals\n\nHow the Museum Received its Largest Research Grant Ever\n\n  * #### Finding Diamonds\n\nColorado\u2019s First Bona Fide Diamond Deposit!\n\n  * #### Nature Play Opening Soon!\n\nAn Urban Gateway to Colorado's Wilderness\n\n  * #### Unearthing Painted Worlds\n\nArchaeological Discoveries and Conservation Efforts at Pa\u00f1amarca, Peru\n\nShare this:\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Pin\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Mail\n\n  * Copy\n\nMuseum Admission\n\nMembership\n\nStay In Touch\n\nHOURS\n\nOpen every day\n\n9 a.m-5 p.m., Most Fridays 9 a.m.-9 p.m., Thanksgiving 9 a.m.-3 p.m.\n\nExcept December 25\n\nReceiving 8 a.m.-3 p.m.\n\nLOCATION\n\n2001 Colorado Blvd.\n\nDenver, CO 80205\n\n303.370.6000\n\nThe Denver Museum of Nature and Science respectfully acknowledges that the\nland we are on today is the traditional and ancestral homelands of the\nCheyenne, Arapaho and Ute Nations.
