And importantly, I put a lot of focus on\nconnecting some of those technological or quantitative elements to the human\nimpact that they have had.\n\nI have now written, narrated, and produced a 30-minute explainer video that\ncovers some of the main themes of the book. It walks the viewer through the\nhistory of money and banking, describes the major problems that they have run\ninto over time, and discusses what some of the emerging technological trends\nmay offer in terms of future improvement. And with the help of the Tranches\ngraphics team, it comes alive with animation that helps visualize the key\nconcepts to accompany the narration.\n\nYou can watch the full 30-minute video here.\n\nTweet\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\n#### Join the Free Investing Newsletter\n\nGet the insider newsletter, keeping you up to date on market conditions, asset\nallocations, undervalued sectors, and specific investment ideas every 6 weeks.\n\nNo spam, no nonsense.
