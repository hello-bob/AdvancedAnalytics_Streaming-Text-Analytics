These observations show a part of the iconic nebula in a\nwhole new light, capturing its complexity with unprecedented spatial\nresolution.\n\nWebb captures iconic Horsehead Nebula in unprecedented detail\n\nWebb\u2019s new images show part of the sky in the constellation Orion (The\nHunter), in the western side of the Orion B molecular cloud. Rising from\nturbulent waves of dust and gas is the Horsehead Nebula, otherwise known as\nBarnard 33, which resides roughly 1300 light-years away.\n\nThe nebula formed from a collapsing interstellar cloud of material, and glows\nbecause it is illuminated by a nearby hot star. The gas clouds surrounding the\nHorsehead have already dissipated, but the jutting pillar is made of thick\nclumps of material that is harder to erode. Astronomers estimate that the\nHorsehead has about five million years left before it too disintegrates.\nWebb\u2019s new view focuses on the illuminated edge of the top of the nebula\u2019s\ndistinctive dust and gas structure.\n\nZoom into the Horsehead Nebula Access the video\n\nHorsehead Nebula (NIRCam image)\n\nThe Horsehead Nebula is a well-known photon-dominated region, or PDR. In such\na region ultraviolet light from young, massive stars creates a mostly neutral,\nwarm area of gas and dust between the fully ionised gas surrounding the\nmassive stars and the clouds in which they are born. This ultraviolet\nradiation strongly influences the gas chemistry of these regions and acts as\nthe most important source of heat.\n\nThese regions occur where interstellar gas is dense enough to remain neutral,\nbut not dense enough to prevent the penetration of far-ultraviolet light from\nmassive stars. The light emitted from such PDRs provides a unique tool to\nstudy the physical and chemical processes that drive the evolution of\ninterstellar matter in our galaxy, and throughout the Universe from the early\nera of vigorous star formation to the present day.\n\nOwing to its proximity and its nearly edge-on geometry, the Horsehead Nebula\nis an ideal target for astronomers to study the physical structures of PDRs\nand the evolution of the chemical characteristics of the gas and dust within\ntheir respective environments, and the transition regions between them. It is\nconsidered one of the best objects in the sky to study how radiation interacts\nwith interstellar matter.\n\nHorsehead Nebula (MIRI image)\n\nThanks to Webb\u2019s MIRI and NIRCam instruments, an international team of\nastronomers have revealed for the first time the small-scale structures of the\nilluminated edge of the Horsehead. They have also detected a network of\nstriated features extending perpendicular to the PDR front and containing dust\nparticles and ionised gas entrained in the photo-evaporative flow of the\nnebula. The observations have also allowed astronomers to investigate the\neffects of dust attenuation and emission, and to better understand the\nmultidimensional shape of the nebula.\n\nNext, astronomers intend to study the spectroscopic data that have been\nobtained of the nebula to evidence the evolution of the physical and chemical\nproperties of the material observed across the nebula.\n\nThese observations were taken in the Webb GTO programme #1192 (PI: K. Misselt)\nand the results have been accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics\n(Abergel et al. 2024).\n\nSlider Tool (Webb NIRCam and MIRI images) Open Image\n\nMore information\n\nWebb is the largest, most powerful telescope ever launched into space. Under\nan international collaboration agreement, ESA provided the telescope\u2019s launch\nservice, using the Ariane 5 launch vehicle. Working with partners, ESA was\nresponsible for the development and qualification of Ariane 5 adaptations for\nthe Webb mission and for the procurement of the launch service by Arianespace.\nESA also provided the workhorse spectrograph NIRSpec and 50% of the mid-\ninfrared instrument MIRI, which was designed and built by a consortium of\nnationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in\npartnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.\n\nWebb is an international partnership between NASA, ESA and the Canadian Space\nAgency (CSA).\n\nRelease on esawebb.org\n\nContact: ESA Media relations media@esa.int\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!\n\nEuropean Space Agency\n\nFAQ Contacts Terms and conditions Privacy notice Careers at ESA Subscribe\n\n", "frontpage": true}
