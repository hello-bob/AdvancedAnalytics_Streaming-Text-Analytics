She explores wide-ranging\ntopics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and\nfactory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.\n\n## This story is part of a group of stories called\n\nFinding the best ways to do good.\n\nIs it just me, or does it seem like a lot of bad things keep happening to\nBoeing airplanes lately?\n\nEver since the shocking January 5 incident in which a door plug fell out of a\nBoeing 737 Max 9 in midair, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane,\nmany fliers have been jumpy. Their fears have been fueled by news sites that\nhave been serving up incident after incident: a Boeing 737 Max 8 sliding off\nthe runway in Houston, another 737 in Houston making an emergency return after\nflames were spotted spewing out of an engine, yet another in Newark reporting\nstuck rudder pedals, a Boeing 777 losing a tire shortly after takeoff from San\nFrancisco, a 777 making an emergency landing in Los Angeles with a suspected\nmechanical issue. And so on and so on.\n\nSo what\u2019s actually happening? Are more planes having incidents than ever\nbefore? Or are we just hearing about more incidents?\n\nIt\u2019s mostly the latter. Minor aviation incidents with few or no injuries \u2014\nlike those listed above \u2014 happen constantly. They just don\u2019t make the news.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigates aviation\nincidents and accidents, lists 12 incidents on commercial aircraft in the\nUnited States so far this year. Last year, during the same time period, there\nwere 13 such incidents.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2023, there were on average 36 incidents a year. We\u2019re about a\nthird of the way through the year, so we\u2019re having a more or less totally\nmundane year, as far as the rate of incidents serious enough to warrant an\nNTSB investigation goes.\n\n### For journalists, is the customer always right?\n\nSo things aren\u2019t going wrong on planes at an unusual rate \u2014 you\u2019re hearing\nabout it at an unusual rate because, ever since the January incident,\njournalists are paying much more attention and writing stories about\nrelatively minor plane incidents, and people are nervous about planes and are\neager to read stories about such incidents.\n\nVarious minor issues, from engine trouble to maintenance issues, were always\nhappening under the radar but weren\u2019t newsworthy; now, the same incidents are\nnews, especially if they happen on a Boeing (and given that almost half of the\nUS commercial fleet is made by Boeing, they often do).\n\nHere\u2019s the question I struggle with as a journalist: Do we have some\nresponsibility not to write such stories?\n\nJournalists take accuracy very seriously. Every journalist I know works very\nhard not to publish a story that\u2019s wrong \u2014 and if they did, they\u2019d feel\nobliged to issue a correction.\n\nBut it\u2019s much less clear what our obligations are with stories that are\ncompletely true, and about a subject readers want to read about, but that\npaint for those readers a misleading picture of the world.\n\nI think most people would agree it would be unethical to systematically report\nonly on lurid crimes committed by one racial group and ignore those same\ncrimes when the perpetrator is of a different background, or to report the\nevidence for a claim and not bother reporting the similarly credible evidence\nthat it\u2019s false.\n\nBut journalism intrinsically involves judgments about what is newsworthy. Do\nminor incidents become newsworthy simply because we\u2019re all on the lookout for\nmajor ones? Is it reasonable to expect everyone to wait months until the data\nis in on whether there\u2019s a trend, when readers want information sooner than\nthat \u2014 and will reward media sites that provide it?\n\nI tend to think that journalists (and, for that matter, all people) have a\nduty not just to tell the truth but to provide enough context with the truth\nthat readers overall come away more informed, not less informed. And I think\nthat a sudden surge in reporting on minor airplane incidents can paradoxically\nend up leaving readers less informed. Their misconceptions aren\u2019t free of\nconsequences, either \u2014 when people choose to drive instead of fly because they\nfear flying, they are probably more likely to die.\n\nSo I think that, ideally, coverage would steer away from writing about\nroutine, boring aviation events \u2014 or would at least give readers context on\nhow routine and boring these events are.\n\n### An accurate aviation story\n\n\u201cThree million people flew in and out of US airports today, and none of them\ndied except of natural causes\u201d isn\u2019t a conventional news story, but it\u2019s\nfactual \u2014 and worth keeping in mind.\n\nPlanes sometimes lose a tire and still land safely with no injuries. They\nsometimes get a puzzling computer warning and have to land at the nearest\nairport \u2014 safely. An engine goes out sometimes, and the plane still lands \u2014\nsafely.\n\nEvery once in a while, you have an incident like the one last December in\nwhich two American Airlines airplanes had emergencies over Phoenix at the\nexact same time, one suffering a failure of its flaps system and one a problem\nwith its engine \u2014 and everyone involved arrives safely, with no injuries.\n\nAnd while the January door plug incident revealed some genuine and glaring\nfailures in processes at Boeing, it\u2019s really hard to overstate how safe\naviation is. In all of the incidents involving regularly scheduled US\ncommercial aircraft over the 15 years from 2010 to 2024, there have been two\npassenger fatalities \u2014 in about 8.75 trillion revenue passenger miles. That\u2019s\na safety record of about one or two passenger fatalities per light-year\ntraveled.\n\nThere are plenty of stories to be reported about the state of the US aviation\nindustry: how it got that breathtaking safety record, whether Boeing is now\nendangering it (as my colleague Whizy Kim wrote this week), and whether we\u2019ve\nlearned the lessons of previous eras when shoddy maintenance practices and\ncost-cutting really did bring down planes regularly in the US. But writers\nshould stop writing \u2014 and you should stop clicking \u2014 stories about minor\nthings going wrong on individual 737s.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.\nSign up here!\n\nWill you support Vox today?\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.\nThat kind of knowledge helps create better citizens, neighbors, friends,\nparents, and stewards of this planet.
