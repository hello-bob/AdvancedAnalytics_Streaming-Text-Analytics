It is commonly used in web design to showcase multiple\nimages or content in a single page. The carousel allows users to easily\nnavigate through the content and view it in a visually appealing way.\n\nUse cases:\n\n  * Product listings: A carousel can be used to showcase a series of products in a single page, allowing users to easily navigate through the products and view them in a visually appealing way.\n  * Blog posts: A carousel can be used to showcase a series of blog posts in a single page, allowing users to easily navigate through the blog posts and view them in a visually appealing way.\n  * News articles: A carousel can be used to showcase a series of news articles in a single page, allowing users to easily navigate through the news articles and view them in a visually appealing way.\n  * Image galleries: A carousel can be used to showcase a series of images in a single page, allowing users to easily navigate through the images and view them in a visually appealing way.\n  * Video galleries: A carousel can be used to showcase a series of videos in a single page, allowing users to easily navigate through the videos and view them in a visually appealing way.\n\n### Let\u2019s get started with understanding the code:**\n\n#### The wrapper\n\n  * x-data=\"{ skip: 1, atBeginning: false, atEnd: false, next() {this.to((current, offset) => current + (offset * this.skip))},: This is the data that will be used to store the state of the carousel.\n  * prev() {this.to((current, offset) => current - (offset * this.skip))},: This is the function that will be used to navigate to the previous slide.\n  * to(strategy) {let slider = this.$refs.slider; let current = slider.scrollLeft; let offset = slider.firstElementChild.getBoundingClientRect().width; slider.scrollTo({ left: strategy(current, offset), behavior: 'smooth' })},: This is the function that will be used to scroll the carousel to the next or previous slide.\n  * focusableWhenVisible: {'x-intersect:enter'() {this.$el.removeAttribute('tabindex')}, 'x-intersect:leave'() {this.$el.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1')},},: This is the object that will be used to store the focusable elements when the carousel is visible.\n  * disableNextAndPreviousButtons: {'x-intersect:enter.threshold.05'() {let slideEls = this.$el.parentElement.children; if (slideEls[0] === this.$el) { this.atBeginning = true } else if (slideEls[slideEls.length-1] === this.$el) { this.atEnd = true } }, 'x-intersect:leave.threshold.05'() {let slideEls = this.$el.parentElement.children; if (slideEls[0] === this.$el) { this.atBeginning = false } else if (slideEls[slideEls.length-1] === this.$el) { this.atEnd = false } },},: This is the object that will be used to store the state of the carousel when the user scrolls the carousel.\n\n#### The buttons\n\n  * <button @click=\"prev\" x-show=\"atBeginning\" tabindex=\"0\">: This is the button that will be used to navigate to the previous slide.\n  * <button @click=\"next\" x-show=\"atEnd\" tabindex=\"0\">: This is the button that will be used to navigate to the next slide.\n\n#### The slides\n\n  * <li role=\"option\" x-bind=\"disableNextAndPreviousButtons\"></li>: This is the slide that will be used to display the content of the carousel.\n\nClasses are removed for brevity, but I\u2019ll keep those classes relveant to the\ntutorial.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ skip: 1, atBeginning: false, atEnd: false, next() { this.to((current, offset) => current + (offset * this.skip)) }, prev() { this.to((current, offset) => current - (offset * this.skip)) }, to(strategy) { let slider = this.$refs.slider let current = slider.scrollLeft let offset = slider.firstElementChild.getBoundingClientRect().width slider.scrollTo({ left: strategy(current, offset), behavior: 'smooth' }) }, focusableWhenVisible: { 'x-intersect:enter'() { this.$el.removeAttribute('tabindex') }, 'x-intersect:leave'() { this.$el.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1') }, }, disableNextAndPreviousButtons: { 'x-intersect:enter.threshold.05'() { let slideEls = this.$el.parentElement.children // If this is the first slide. if (slideEls[0] === this.$el) { this.atBeginning = true // If this is the last slide. } else if (slideEls[slideEls.length-1] === this.$el) { this.atEnd = true } }, 'x-intersect:leave.threshold.05'() { let slideEls = this.$el.parentElement.children // If this is the first slide. if (slideEls[0] === this.$el) { this.atBeginning = false // If this is the last slide. } else if (slideEls[slideEls.length-1] === this.$el) { this.atEnd = false } }, }, }\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"carousel-label\" role=\"region\" tabindex=\"0\" x-on:keydown.left=\"prev\" x-on:keydown.right=\"next\"> <div > <button :class=\"{ 'opacity-50 ': atBeginning }\" :aria-disabled=\"atBeginning\" :tabindex=\"atEnd ? -1 : 0\" x-on:click=\"prev\" tabindex=\"0\" ><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"mx-auto\"> &larr; </span></button > <button :class=\"{ 'opacity-50 ': atEnd }\" :aria-disabled=\"atEnd\" :tabindex=\"atEnd ? -1 : 0\" x-on:click=\"next\" tabindex=\"0\" ><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"mx-auto\"> &rarr; </span></button > </div> <ul role=\"listbox\" aria-labelledby=\"carousel-content-label\" tabindex=\"0\" x-ref=\"slider\"> <li role=\"option\" x-bind=\"disableNextAndPreviousButtons\"> <!-- Slide content goes here --> </li> <!-- More slides --> </ul> </div> </div>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a simple carousel that can be used for any type of content, such as a\nproduct listing, blog posts, news articles, or image galleries.
