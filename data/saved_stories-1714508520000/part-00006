Under the DSA, the Commission can order the temporary\nsuspension of a service as a last resort in any case.\n\nOther candidates at the debate were more noncommittal. Marie-Agnes Strack-\nZimmermann, the lead candidate for the liberal ALDE party, said we have to see\n\"what happens there\" when talking about TikTok.\n\nVon der Leyen herself is reportedly avoiding TikTok while campaigning for a\nsecond term.\n\nTikTok didn't respond to a request a comment in time for publication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Tags\n\nContent moderation Digital Services Act Elections in Europe European\nParliament election 2024 Illegal content Platforms\n\nRelated Countries\n\nEU27\n\nRelated People\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n\nRelated Organizations\n\nEuropean Commission TikTok\n\n## Our readers read next\n\n## Facebook and Instagram hit with EU probes over Russian disinformation\n\n5 HRS ago 5 mins read\n\n## Timeline: How Humza Yousaf blew up his leadership in 5 days\n\n13 HRS ago 5 mins read\n\n## Von der Leyen opens the door to Europe\u2019s hard right\n\n16 HRS ago 6 mins read\n\n## Greens lionized by Europe\u2019s young voters at EU presidential debate\n\n18 HRS ago 4 mins read\n\n## More from Pieter Haeck\n\n## Ex-Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt was a victim of Chinese hacking\n\nBelgium\u2019s foreign minister recently summoned Beijing\u2019s envoy over espionage\ncampaign.\n\nApr 29 2 mins read\n\n## New CEO of Dutch chips champ enters US-China fray\n\nIncoming ASML chief Christophe Fouquet must navigate a politically sensitive\nlandscape when it comes to export controls.\n\nApr 24 5 mins read\n\n## Dutch government threatens to leave Facebook over privacy\n\nThe Dutch government is warning it could stop using Facebook Pages before the\nsummer over data protection concerns on how the platform targets its users.\nDutch state ...\n\nApr 19 2 mins read\n\n## Vestager\u2019s kids tell her \u2018to put down that phone\u2019\n\nOnce one of the EU\u2019s top tweeters, digital chief Margrethe Vestager says she\u2019s\nnow less enthusiastic about social media.\n\nApr 16 2 mins read\n\n", "frontpage": true}
