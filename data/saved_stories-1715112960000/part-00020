As\nchildren, we looked up to our parents and assumed they had all the answers.\nIt's only when we grew older that we realised they, too, were figuring things\nout as they went along. The same goes for the celebrities, entrepreneurs, and\ninfluencers we admire from afar. No matter how successful they may appear,\neveryone is facing challenges of their own, learning as they go, and most\nlikely climbing what seems an insurmountable mountain.\n\nSo, when you see someone online banging their chest about their achievements,\nremember that their success is not solely attributable to skill or their own\ndoing. Luck, timing, and a myriad of other factors play a role, and even the\nmost accomplished individuals are still learning and growing.\n\nIt's crucial not to let others' self-promotion make you feel disenfranchised\nor less capable.\n\nThe pursuit of status and external validation is a game that can never truly\nbe won. As Felix Dennis once said, \"Happiness? Do not make me laugh. The rich\nare not happy. I have yet to meet a single really rich happy man or woman\u2014and\nI have met many rich people.\"\n\nConstantly chasing after the next milestone or comparing ourselves to others\nis a surefire recipe for dissatisfaction.\n\nInstead of getting caught up in the highlight reel, focus on finding joy in\nthe little things \u2013 the small moments and simple pleasures that make life\nworth living. Savour that first sip of coffee in the morning, laugh at a funny\nTikTok with your partner, or admire the colours of a particularly stunning\nsunset. By cultivating gratitude and contentment independent of external\nfactors, we can find a deeper sense of fulfilment.\n\nTo navigate life's challenges with grace and resilience, we must also develop\na strong inner foundation. This is where the principles of Stoicism come into\nplay. Stoicism teaches us to focus on what we can control \u2013 our thoughts,\nactions, and reactions \u2013 and to accept what we cannot. By mastering our inner\nworld, we can face the outer world with equanimity and strength, even in the\nface of adversity.\n\nIn today's digital age, Stoicism offers a powerful antidote to the comparison\ntrap. Instead of letting social media dictate our self-worth, we can choose to\nfocus on our own growth and progress, cultivating self-awareness, self-\ndiscipline, and self-compassion along the way.\n\nRemember, true happiness and fulfilment come from within, not from external\nvalidation or material success. By staying focused on your own path, finding\njoy in the little things, and developing a resilient mindset, you can rise\nabove the noise and live authentically in a world that often feels uncertain\nand overwhelming.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself scrolling through social media and feeling\ninadequate, remember that everyone is fighting their own battles, learning as\nthey go, and that perfection is an illusion. Embrace your own journey, find\njoy in the little things, and trust in your own resilience. That's the secret\nto a life well-lived.\n\n### The illusion of having it all figured out\n\n### Hello world\n\n### Better than yesterday.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
