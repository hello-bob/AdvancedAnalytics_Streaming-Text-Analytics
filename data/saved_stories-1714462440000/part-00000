I didn\u2019t understand why some posts create a big splash on the web with\ndiscussions lasting years while others, more often than not, didn\u2019t provoke\nany response at all.\n\nMy colleague Filippo wrote a post with his observations on the subject,\nfocusing on marketing acquisition channels. Pick these and these terms and\nyou\u2019ll appear in Google Search (that\u2019s SEO), pay Facebook for an extra reach\n(that\u2019s SEM), and you\u2019ll succeed. I absolutely agree with this approach but I\nfeel I have something to add.\n\nYou can drive as much traffic as you can but if the content is no good your\nexpensive visitors will switch their attention to something else immediately\nand leave no trace of their presence other than a number in your Analytics. So\nwhile the acquisition is important, content is critical. There will be no\nchicken without an egg.\n\n### Productive Emotions and Biased Algorithms\n\nCertain things make people click and want to say what they can, share your\nstuff on Facebook, return to see updates, new comments, and responses to their\nopinion. We kind of want that as bloggers. But what are those things? Ryan\nHoliday in his book Trust me, I\u2019m lying gives an answer that\u2019s provocative an\nworth sharing. What engages people, according to him, is productive emotions.\nFear. Outrage. Greed. Guilt. No emotion in the text means no social sharing, a\ndead post. Depressive emotions have the same effect \u2013 people wouldn\u2019t share\ndepressive thoughts. So the content that engages needs to be emotionally\ncharged and productive.\n\nAir pollution in the air (Sofia is having smog this week)? That\u2019s hideous, why\nare those people driving diesel cars? (Fear, Outrage). Bitcoin hits $15000\n(Greed, fear, what am I missing?).\n\nArticles written this way have an unexpected ally \u2013 the newsfeed algorithms.\nThe algorithms know what makes people click more and are biased towards\nnegative emotions. If a post is \u201cproductive\u201d, algorithms for selecting best\ncontent would likely give it a preference. Sara Wachter-Boettcher wrote a book\non the subject called \u201cTechnically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, and\nOther Threats of Toxic Tech\u201d that dives into the subject. Despite her focus\nbeing on apps being non-inclusive, the book is a good start for learning more\nabout this. Biased algorithms are a very well exploited traffic source these\ndays. Social networks promote false, controversial, or propaganda content\nbecause it works.\n\n> \u201cThe most powerful predictor of what spreads online is anger\u201d\n>\n> \u2014 Holiday, Ryan. \u201cTrust Me, I\u2019m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator.\u201d\n\nEach time I see an article regarding the famous Google Memo, I wonder which\nemotion should I feel. Should I admire the media manipulation creativity of\nthe author? Should I feel offended or empathetic or what? It\u2019s brilliant in a\nvery sad way to create division between people, to generalize in a way that\nmakes literally everyone feel outraged. Men vs women. East vs West. South vs\nNorth. Rich vs Poor. Conservatives vs Liberals. Separatists vs Unionists. Our\nbrains seem to seek this kind of information and make us spend time on it\ndespite our best interest. Compare a negative controversial post to an article\nabout Tesla Model 3 \u2013 how many people actually care about electric cars? And\nhow many users would ever be interested in CSS optimisation tricks? \u201cI\ndiscovered the Marquee tag. You are not going to believe what happened next.\u201d\n\nRyan Holiday\u2019s book is bragging about outrage but is exploiting it to the\nmaximum, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I think about it and share it in\nthis blog post.\n\n### Controversy has Price\n\nThe problem with controversy is that by writing such things you become one of\nthem. The small number of controversial articles I had on my former blog had\nlots of comments and page views but I also got threats and started feeling\nuncomfortable blogging. I feel uncomfortable blogging now that I write this\npost too. The author of the Google Memo got plenty of reactions but also lost\nnot only his job but his future chances of employment unless he changes his\nname or something. Using controversy is like selling your soul to the devil of\ntraffic. It bites back.\n\n### Positive Emotionally Charged Posts\n\nI believe that it is still possible to create an emotionally charged post\nwithout resorting to negativity and controversy. Social networks like Quora,\nLinkedIn, and Twitter provide us with some good examples of how to do that.\n\n\u2013 Curiosity and self-improvement is my favorite, although it might be linked\nto Greed. \u2013 Life stories \u2013 I find these very attractive, however, I can\u2019t tell\nwhat exactly is the root emotion. It must be something yellow or media like\nSun wouldn\u2019t be full of celebrity gossip. \u2013 Dreams for the future \u2013 who\ndoesn\u2019t want to have an electric self-driving car? Or an electric sheep \u2013\nEvents and Places \u2013 beach photos and beautiful meals are incredible. And let\u2019s\nnot forget recipes.\n\nProductive emotions, in my opinion, are the salt that makes people click. It\u2019s\nalso the poison that transforms Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other big media\nto be dangerously toxic. Should be used in moderation.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Reddit\n  * Tumblr\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted in Random, Thinking\n\n## Published by Veselin\n\nI WordPress View all posts by Veselin\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nMy name is Veselin Nikolov.
