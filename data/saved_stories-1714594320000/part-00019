In 2017, under then-President\nDonald Trump, the FCC repealed those rules.\n\nThe measure passed Thursday on a 3-2 vote split along party lines, with\nDemocratic commissioners in favor and Republicans opposed.\n\nNet neutrality effectively requires providers of internet service to treat all\ntraffic equally, eliminating any incentive they might face to favor business\npartners or to hobble competitors. The public interest group Public Knowledge\ndescribes net neutrality as \u201cthe principle that the company that connects you\nto the internet does not get to control what you do on the internet.\u201d\n\nThe rules, for instance, ban practices that throttle or block certain sites or\napps, or that reserve higher speeds for the services or customers willing to\npay more for them.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPowell likely to signal that lower inflation is needed before Fed would cut\nrates\n\nFCC fines wireless carriers for sharing user locations without consent\n\nEPA bans consumer use of a toxic chemical widely used as a paint stripper but\nknown to cause cancer\n\n\u201cIn our post-pandemic world, we know that broadband is a necessity, not a\nluxury,\u201d FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement ahead of the\nvote.\n\nWhile it\u2019s been almost seven years since the FCC killed the previous net\nneutrality rules, their reinstatement isn\u2019t expected to noticeably change\nusers\u2019 online experience. Public Knowledge legal director John Bergmayer\ncredits that to several states having passed their own net neutrality measures\nprior to 2015, all of which remained in force when the FCC reversed course two\nyears later following Trump\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cSome of the absolute worst excesses from (internet providers) were kept in\ncheck by state level oversight,\u201d Bergmayer said.\n\nStates like California went even further than the FCC did \u2014 for instance, by\nbanning a practice called \u201czero rating.\u201d That\u2019s where, for instance, a mobile\nprovider might strike a business deal to steer users toward a particular\nstreaming service by zeroing out any related data charges. Other states with\nstrong net neutrality rules include Colorado, Maine, Oregon, Vermont and\nWashington, according to Bergmayer.\n\nThe telecommunications industry opposed the reintroduction of the federal\nrules, as it has before, declaring them an example of unnecessary government\ninterference in business decisions.\n\nDAVID HAMILTON\n\nHamilton is an Associated Press business and technology reporter based in San\nFrancisco.\n\ntwitter\n\nmailto\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nJury finds Wisconsin man guilty in killing, sexual assault of 20-month-old\ngirl\n\nUndo\n\nPro VerbraucherAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Vor 1988 geboren?
