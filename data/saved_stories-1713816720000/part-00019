He\ntold The Independent: \u201cThe EU\u2019s proposal for a youth mobility scheme for\n18-30-year-olds would give British young people the renewed ability to live,\nstudy and work across the EU.\n\n\u201cIt would also remove barriers to young EU citizens coming here to fill vital\nemployment gaps.\u201d\n\nRishi Sunak was told the EU are offering him a lifeline (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n(PA Wire)\n\nHe added: \u201cMPs, whichever party they are from, should listen to young people\nwho are desperate to be able to travel again in Europe.\n\n\u201cRishi Sunak should realise that his government is hated by young people and\nthe EU is offering him a lifeline.\n\n\u201cLabour should not dismiss this scheme because they will need both the support\nof young people to win the election and the hard work of young Europeans to\nimplement their economic programme in office.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that the EU\u2019s negotiating abilities will prevail and this plan\nwill go ahead.\n\n\u201cWhile it is not accurate to call it freedom of movement, it could be a\nstepping stone towards the return to freedom of movement that we want to see.\u201d\n\nEC vice-president Maros Sefcovic said Brexit had \u201chit young people in the EU\nand the UK who would like to study, work and live abroad particularly hard\u201d.\n\nThe UK currently has individual youth mobility schemes with 13 countries, and\nthe government said it preferred such bilateral arrangements over an EU-wide\ndeal (PA Archive)\n\nHe added: \u201cToday, we take the first step towards an ambitious but realistic\nagreement between the EU and the UK that would fix this issue. Our aim is to\nrebuild human bridges between young Europeans on both sides of the Channel.\u201d\n\nEU member states would have had to agree to the proposals first before any\nnegotiations with the UK could begin.\n\nBut a UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are not introducing an EU-wide\nyouth mobility scheme (YMS) \u2013 free movement within the EU was ended and there\nare no plans to introduce it.\n\n\u201cWe have successful schemes with 13 countries, including Australia and New\nZealand, and remain open to agreeing them with our international partners,\nincluding individual EU member states, where it\u2019s in the UK\u2019s interest and\nsupports the skills and opportunities of our youth.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Stella Creasy blasted the Conservative\u2019s \u201cduplicity over Europe\u201d\neven though her party also ruled out an EU-wide deal.\n\nShe wrote on X: \u201cThey\u2019ve actively tried to negotiate youth visa scheme with\nseveral European countries. EU offered to short-circuit the process.\n\n\u201cPanicked by their Brexiteer backbenches they have rejected whole idea and\nyouth opportunities with it.\u201d\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said such an agreement would be a \u201cwin-\nwin-win\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cLiberal Democrats have long been urging the government to negotiate\na reciprocal youth mobility scheme with Europe.\n\n\u201cOf course, the details would need to be negotiated but no sensible UK\ngovernment would reject this idea out of hand.\u201d\n\n### 1/3Government rejects EU agreement to help young people travel abroad\n\n### Government rejects EU agreement to help young people travel abroad\n\nRishi Sunak was told the EU are offering him a lifeline (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\nPA Wire\n\n### Government rejects EU agreement to help young people travel abroad\n\nThe UK currently has individual youth mobility schemes with 13 countries, and\nthe government said it preferred such bilateral arrangements over an EU-wide\ndeal\n\nPA Archive\n\n### Government rejects EU agreement to help young people travel abroad\n\nEC vice-president Maros Sefcovic said Brexit had \u2018hit young people in the EU\nand the UK who would like to study, work and live abroad particularly hard\u2019\n\nGetty\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
