Here are five more things we\nneed to work on.\n\nNoah Smith\n\nApr 24, 2024\n\n234\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What America needs to do now on national security\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n82\n\nShare\n\n\"Arsenal of Democracy - Washington, DC\" by gregor_y, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t aware, the U.S. Congress just passed \u2014 and Biden signed \u2014\na major national security bill. The bill has four main provisions:\n\n  1. $61 billion for aid to Ukraine (including $13 billion to re-stock U.S. military supplies that were previously donated)\n\n  2. $26 billion for Israel and Gaza (including $9 billion for humanitarian aid to the Gazans and others)\n\n  3. $8 billion for aid to Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific allies\n\n  4. A measure to force the Chinese company ByteDance to sell TikTok or else shut down operations within 270 days\n\nI\u2019m actually pretty surprised this bill passed, for two reasons. First, Mike\nJohnson, the Speaker of the House, had stalled Ukraine aid for quite some\ntime, under pressure from the MAGA movement. Second, the Senate looked like it\nwas going to stall the passage of TikTok divestment. But suddenly, both\nobstacles seemed to evaporate, and the bill passed. The most likely reason,\nfrom what I can tell, is that Congressional leaders saw intelligence briefings\nthat made them realize that A) TikTok is definitely acting as both propaganda\nand spyware for the CCP, and B) Putin\u2019s territorial ambitions in Europe go\nwell beyond Ukraine.\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t agree with absolutely everything in this bill, the fact that\nit passed is a very good sign. It means that our leaders are, slowly and\nreluctantly, waking up to the magnitude of the overseas threat that America\nand its allies face. The Ukraine aid shows that although Russian propaganda\nhas subverted much of the MAGA movement, there is still a bipartisan majority\nthat is willing to stand up to Putin. The Taiwan aid, though far too small for\nmy liking, shows that the U.S. is starting to realize the danger of an Asian\nwar. And even though it will certainly be challenged in court, the TikTok\ndivestiture provision suggests that the U.S. is not completely comfortable\nwith the idea of its mass media becoming the instrument of hostile\ntotalitarian governments.\n\nThat all represents progress. But it\u2019s only a glimmer of progress, because our\nmajor national security dilemmas remain unsolved. We need this bill to be the\nbeginning of a more serious attitude toward national security, not simply a\nstopgap measure that allows us to forget about security and go back to arguing\nabout culture wars.\n\nHere are what I think our five top priorities should be:\n\n####\n\n1\\. Rebuild the U.S. defense-industrial base\n\nThis is the most essential thing. The Allies won World War 2 because of\nAmerican manufacturing capacity; thanks to decades of divestment, anti-\nmanufacturing policy, and offshoring, that capacity largely no longer exists.\nI\u2019ve written two posts about this, and I plan to write a lot more, because I\nthink it\u2019s hard to overstate the magnitude of the danger the disappearance of\nthe Arsenal of Democracy represents to the rest of the world:\n\n#### People are realizing that the Arsenal of Democracy is gone\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nNovember 30, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\n#### We're not ready for the Big One\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nOctober 15, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nThe U.S. is now basically incapable of making large numbers of naval vessels,\nmissiles, or artillery shells, and we haven\u2019t yet developed the ability to\nmake large numbers of drones (which are becoming increasingly central to\nmodern warfare).\n\nThe shipbuilding problem is especially acute, and people are starting to wake\nup. Here\u2019s an article in the WSJ from February, entitled \u201cChina\u2019s Shipyards\nAre Ready for a Protracted War. America\u2019s Aren\u2019t.\u201d Here are similar articles\nfrom Business Insider and the U.S. Naval Institute, to cite just a couple. But\nwhile the media is starting to get a sense of urgency, the Navy itself still\nseems to be in damage control/spin mode, canceling briefings in order to avoid\nhaving to talk about its shipbuilding problems. The U.S. is quietly having to\nask much smaller allies like Japan and Korea, who have retained their\nshipbuilding abilities, to help out. But due to their small size, they can\nonly make a limited difference.\n\nMeanwhile, similar problems exist with missiles, artillery shells, and\nbasically everything else a military needs. And that\u2019s not even getting into\nthe issue of how many parts and components of what we do build are sourced\nfrom China (it\u2019s a lot).\n\nThis has to change, and fast. By \u201cfast\u201d I mean \u201cwithin the next three years\u201d,\nnot \u201cwithin the next decade\u201d. So how do we change it?\n\nFirst, we have to ensure consistent funding for defense. Currently, funding\nthat gets allocated to the military can\u2019t actually be spent until it\u2019s\nappropriated. Which means that each year, there\u2019s a big Congressional fight\nover whether we\u2019re going to actually spend the money we said we\u2019re going to\nspend. Defense appropriations often get used as a political bargaining chip in\nbudget battles by (sometimes) Democrats and (especially) Republicans. As a\nresult, defense contractors can\u2019t count on getting their money, which adds\nmajor risk and holds up production. This needs to end; Congress needs to\nchange the defense spending process so that funding can be reliably disbursed\nyear after year without the need for regular, repeated discretionary\nCongressional action.\n\nSecond, and on a related note, we need to implement multiyear procurement for\ndefense contractors. Right now, we need a whole lot more businesses \u2014 both\nstartups and existing businesses to commit to defense manufacturing for the\nnext few years. But if we only pay them year by year, the risk of making that\ncommitment is too high. So we need to commit to multiple years of payment, in\nadvance.\n\nThird, we need to remove barriers to factory construction. Environmental\nreview (NEPA and similar state laws like CEQA) should be scaled back\nsignificantly for defense manufacturing, and other burdensome regulations\nshould be relaxed for defense manufacturing specifically.\n\nThese should not be the only steps we take. There are a bunch of other ideas\nout there, such as investing in vocational education for defense\nmanufacturing, leveraging public-private partnerships, using the Defense\nProduction Act to relive various bottlenecks, and so on. I don\u2019t have either\nthe expertise or the time to evaluate each of these right now, though I plan\nto look at a bunch of them in depth in the future. But the key message is that\nwe\u2019ll probably need to do a bunch of different things, all at the same time,\nin order to even partially restore the Arsenal of Democracy by the later part\nof this decade.\n\nIn addition to reviving defense manufacturing, the U.S. needs to revive\ncivilian manufacturing in areas that can be repurposed for defense in the\nevent of a war with China. For example, civilian commercial shipbuilding is\nentirely different from naval shipbuilding, and the U.S. does very little of\nthat; we should try to encourage the development of a domestic shipbuilding\nindustry, preferably with regulatory reform instead of throwing money at it\n(since that money could be better used for naval shipbuilding).\n\nWe need to make sure not to outsource production of \u201cfoundational\u201d or\n\u201ctrailing-edge\u201d chips to China; these are older chips not covered by export\ncontrols, which China can already easily produce in large volume, which are\nused a lot by the military.\n\nAnd we need a commercial drone industry. Currently, China is the world leader\nin commercial drones, while the U.S. has basically zero presence. We need\nindustrial policy here; there needs to be an Inflation Reduction Act for\ndrones, and we need regulatory changes, like designating areas where users can\noperate commercial drones beyond visual range.\n\nThis is not a complete list of things the U.S. needs to do in order to become\nthe Arsenal of Democracy again, but it should be enough to give the general\nidea.\n\n####\n\n2\\. Make Europe understand that they have to take the lead on Ukraine\n\nThe aid to Ukraine in the recent U.S. national security bill was very good.\nIt\u2019ll stabilize the battlefield situation, which has turned into a grinding\nwar of position. And it demonstrates America\u2019s ongoing commitment to the\ntransatlantic alliance.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a permanent solution. More than half of House Republicans \u2014 112\nto 101 \u2014 voted against the Ukraine aid portion of the bill. Despite Trump\nhimself softening on the bill, it\u2019s clear that a large chunk of the GOP now\nviews Ukraine as a culture-war issue, on which the true MAGA position is to\noppose Ukraine aid. Some GOP legislators are warning that their compatriots\nare being swayed by Russian propaganda, and they are correct. What this means\nis that Ukraine can\u2019t count on similar follow-ups to this aid bill in 2025 and\nbeyond, no matter who wins the election \u2014 there\u2019s always the possibility that\nthe MAGA faction will be able to block it, just as it came very close to\nblocking it this time.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, the U.S. is facing a much bigger challenge:\nChina. China\u2019s manufacturing capabilities utterly dwarf Russia\u2019s, and in fact\nare about as big as those of the U.S. and all of its allies combined. The U.S.\nhas some allies in the Indo-Pacific \u2014 Japan, South Korea, Australia, and\nhopefully someday India \u2014 but these are not even close to being capable of\ntaking on the Chinese juggernaut on their own. The U.S. needs to focus the\nvast majority of its resources in the Indo-Pacific if it wants to have any\nchance of deterring a major war. That will mean fewer resources for Ukraine.\n\nFortunately, Ukraine does have another major ally that is capable of checking\nRussia: Europe. I wrote about this last year:\n\n#### Europe has to stand against Russia\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nFebruary 12, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nTogether, the non-U.S. countries of NATO have four times the population of\nRussia, and ten times its productive capacity. China is now feeding Russia\narms and supplies, meaning that it\u2019s effectively engaged in a proxy war\nagainst Europe. But even with Russia getting limited amounts of Chinese aid,\nEurope can outmatch the Russians if it gathers the political will to do so.\n\nAs it became clear that U.S. aid to Ukraine had become more reliable, some\nEuropean leaders \u2014 especially French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 started\ntaking the lead, providing a bunch of ammunition, and talking tough about\npossible direct intervention in the war. But far more than extra shells and\ntough words will be needed. Ukraine needs massive amounts of air defense and\ndrones to hold out against Russian assaults. If Europe can provide these\nthings, Ukraine may be able to resist until the Russians give up and come to\nthe bargaining table.\n\nSo the U.S. needs to make it clear to the Europeans that U.S. support will be\npatchy at best going forward. France, Germany, and the UK have to come\ntogether and commit the resources to support Ukraine for the long haul.\n\n####\n\n3\\. Add active liberal messaging to the information ecosystem\n\nThe TikTok divestment bill was an important milestone. Some still harbor free\nspeech concerns, and no doubt TikTok\u2019s lawyers will claim in court that a\nforced change of ownership is robbing them of their constitutional rights. But\nZephyr Teachout argues convincingly that the ability to restrict foreign\nownership of domestic mass media is among the most fundamental characteristics\nof a democracy:\n\n> Any effort to restrict a communication platform inevitably invites concerns\n> about the First Amendment, but constitutional claims on behalf of foreign\n> governments are extremely weak. In 2011, for example, a federal court\n> rejected a challenge to the federal laws prohibiting foreign nationals from\n> making campaign contributions. Then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the\n> country has a compelling interest in limiting the participation of foreign\n> citizens in such activities, \u201cthereby preventing foreign influence over the\n> U.S. political process.\u201d...\n>\n> Forcing a TikTok divestiture...would address one specific issue: control\n> over a dominant communication platform by a hostile foreign superpower with\n> a well-documented interest in influencing domestic politics in the U.S. and\n> other countries...\n>\n> The basic premise of democratic self-government is the idea that people\n> collectively make the rules of their community and collectively direct their\n> laws...Could American corporations or individuals wreak just as much havoc\n> on public discourse as the Chinese government? Yes. But on some level, that\n> is part of the democratic bargain. Members of this political community must\n> have unique rights to shape the institutions that coerce and constrain their\n> behavior\u2014rights not afforded to people, corporations, or governments outside\n> the community...We should...affirm the historic norm that countries have the\n> right to protect their communications, politics, and private data from\n> foreign governmental control.\n\nBut even if this logic holds up in court and the ban goes through, the\ndefenders of liberal democracy are still at a disadvantage in the global war\nof ideas. Totalitarian powers like China and Russia have large, well-funded\npropaganda departments to tell their stories to the world; liberalism\u2019s\nadvocates, in contrast, are largely volunteers working in their spare time.\n\nThat\u2019s why the U.S. government should step in, and \u2014 in partnership with\nprivate citizens where possible \u2014 make the case for liberalism to the American\npeople and to the people of the world. In a post last year, I sketched out\nwhat this would look like:\n\n#### Liberalism is losing the information war\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nMy favorite historical example of this is \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Sucker\u201d, a 1940s film\ncreated by the U.S. Department of War to denounce Nazi ideology and build\nsupport for the desegregation of the military:\n\nThis is propaganda, but it\u2019s not the kind of propaganda that forces people to\nconsume it. It\u2019s simply a liberal government telling the story of what it\nmeans to be liberal.\n\nPrivate citizens, of course, can and should help with this as well. Left-\nleaning outlets like the New York Times and MSNBC could try to push back on\nthe anti-American narratives that have taken hold among extreme progressives\nand leftists, and help restore some Rooseveltian patriotism. On the\nconservative side, Elon Musk and Twitter X may at least temporarily be allied\nwith the faction that opposes Ukraine aid and wants to appease China, but he\nmight eventually come around. And the Murdochs and Fox News could do a lot\nmore to convince the conservative world that America and our system of\nalliances are worth defending from the likes of Xi Jinping.\n\n####\n\n4\\. Solidify the alliance with India and make more effort to court Indonesia\n\nThe New Axis of China, Russia, and Iran is far too powerful for the U.S. to\noppose alone; even China by itself would be too powerful for the U.S. to\nhandle one-on-one. Thus, U.S. national security relies on having strong\nallies. Under Biden, we\u2019ve done a decent job of reinvigorating our Cold War\nera alliances with developed democracies in Europe and Asia. But these are\ngenerally smallish, shrinking countries, often with severe economic problems\nof their own. We need a bigger gang if we\u2019re going to counter China.\n\nThe most important future ally, of course, by leaps and bounds, is India. A\nrecent Carnegie Endowment report emphasizes just how much India towers above\nother emerging powers, both in population and in projected economic heft:\n\nSource: Carnegie Endowment\n\nFortunately, India is also by far the most pro-American of the emerging\npowers:\n\nSource: Carnegie Endowment\n\nIn fact, as I wrote in a post last year, India and the U.S. are seeing a\ndeepening engagement at both the highest levels of politics and the grassroots\nsocial and cultural level:\n\n#### Indiamerica\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nJune 23, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nI don\u2019t expect India to be willing or able to ride to Taiwan\u2019s rescue in the\nevent of a Chinese invasion later this decade. But as its economy, its\nmilitary capabilities, and its friendship with other U.S. allies like Japan\ngrow, India will become a more and more potent ally across a wide variety of\nfronts. So U.S. leaders have to continue to push very hard for deepening\nintegration with India \u2014 investment, trade, diplomatic coordination, military\nexercises, multilateral alliances and regional pacts, and so on.\n\nAnd we need to commit to continuing to take large numbers of Indian\nimmigrants, to deepen the grassroots linkages between our societies (as well\nas getting America some needed talent). The first step here is to eliminate or\nat least weaken per-country gaps on green cards, a relic of the 1965\nimmigration system that discriminates against large countries.\n\nIndia is the most important emerging U.S. ally, but there\u2019s another very\nimportant \u201cswing states\u201d in the Indo-Pacific that we have not done enough to\ncourt: Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia is a very populous nation with a lot of natural resources and latent\nmanufacturing potential. It also has an incredibly crucial geographic location\nfor any Asian conflict, since it controls the trade routes between China and\nthe rest of the world. Yet the U.S. seems oddly committed to ignoring\nIndonesia, even as it drifts closer to the Chinese orbit. I complained about\nthis in a post last year:\n\n#### The U.S. must not ignore Indonesia\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nNovember 29, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nThe problem has only gotten worse since then, with the election of a new\nPresident, Prabowo Subianto, who appears to be more pro-China than his\npredecessor. Meanwhile, China defeated Japan in a bidding match to build high-\nspeed rail in Indonesia, and \u2014 unlike most of China\u2019s Belt and Road projects \u2014\nit appears to be a success.\n\nIndonesia still cooperates militarily with the U.S., and worries about China\u2019s\nclaims on some of its waters. But the U.S. and its Asian allies need to step\nup their efforts to court Indonesia economically, offering infrastructure\ninvestment and development (perhaps with American financing and Japanese\nconstruction), FDI in Indonesian manufacturing and other industries, and trade\nopportunities. The U.S. can no longer afford to treat this vitally important\ncountry as the \u201cbiggest invisible thing on Earth\u201d.\n\n####\n\n5\\. Disengage from the Middle East as much as possible\n\nThe U.S. will be hard-pressed to counter both China and Russia at the same\ntime, even with Europe\u2019s help. It will be impossible to do these things while\nsimultaneously checking Iran in the Middle East and supporting Israel\u2019s war in\nGaza.\n\nCampaigning against the Houthi pirates depletes America\u2019s stock of hard-to-\nreplace missiles and has accomplished little so far. Aid to Israel crowds out\nother budget items, and is not really necessary for Israel\u2019s defense. And\nhelping Israel prosecute its fairly brutal campaign in Gaza weakens America\u2019s\nmoral standing in the world, especially in the eyes of majority-Muslim Asian\ncountries like Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nIn a post last year, I argued that as horrible as Hamas\u2019 October 7th attack on\nIsrael was, the U.S. should nevertheless resist getting embroiled in the\nregion, and focus its attention on Asia instead:\n\n#### Asia is much more important to U.S. interests than the Middle East\n\nNoah Smith\n\n\u00b7\n\nNovember 1, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nMy assessment has not changed since then. Asia is a place where the U.S. is\nboth badly needed, and in a position to do a lot of good, by helping\ndemocratic nations remain independent of an expansionist superpower. The\nMiddle East is an increasingly irrelevant quagmire \u2014 a violent region with\nlittle to offer and little hope of resolution.\n\nThe days when the U.S. was powerful enough to defend the entire world at once\nare long gone. Now we have a choice of whether to stretch ourselves to the\nbreaking point in the hopes that we can somehow bluff our way through all the\nconflicts at once, or to refocus our hard power on the points of maximum\nleverage in the defense of global liberal democracy. That doesn\u2019t seem like a\ndifficult choice.\n\nSo those are the five things I think the U.S. needs to do in order to bolster\nboth its own security and the security of its allies, in the wake of the\nrecent breakthrough on national security legislation. They are all difficult\ntasks that will require both sustained political will and delicate, skilled\nmanagement. But I believe they are all within the realm of the possible.\n\nShare\n\n234 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n15 Restacks\n\n234\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What America needs to do now on national security\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n82\n\nShare\n\n82 Comments\n\nDanApr 24Liked by Noah SmithAs someone from the tech world who had never been\ninvolved with defense before, I've recently been helping out on a defense\nstartup.
