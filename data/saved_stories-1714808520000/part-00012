The protocol uses a string of 32 ones and zeroes as\nan address for the specialized computers (called routers) to figure out how to\nforward packets of data. Those 32 bites mean there are only 4.3 billion\npossible IPv4 addresses, which seemed like a lot when there were only two\nmillion personal computers and only a few thousand capable of networking. The\ngrowth of the internet has led to scarcity, creating value in addresses that\nwere originally distributed for free to whatever networks needed them.\n\n#### Cogent Leasing\n\nCogent has been leasing out addresses for several years. All internet service\nproviders (ISPs) give IP addresses to their users, but Cogent was among the\nfirst to lease those addresses independently of internet access. (Internet\naccess customers normally require a unique address as part of their service.)\nSources are hard to find, but prevailing wisdom is that they have over 10M\naddresses leased for about $0.30 per month, or $36M per year in revenue.\n\n#### The Secured Note\n\nThe notes are expected to be repaid in five years. It\u2019s important that Cogent\nis creating a special-purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary for this security.\nThe registry in charge of IPv4 records in North America is ARIN, the American\nRegistry for Internet Numbers, and while they allow transfers, they are only\nallowed if the recipient can demonstrate need, or if the recipient owns the\nentire organization or network that holds the addresses. By placing the\naddresses in a subsidiary, even if Cogent were to go bankrupt or stop paying\non its secured note, the note holders could claim the addresses from the\nsubsidiary, and sell them off through a marketplace like IPv4.Global by Hilco\nStreambank.\n\nThe underlying value of the addresses is only as strong as demand for them. In\na worldwide sale market of about 40M addresses per year, the largest buyers\nhave consistently been the \u201chyperscaler\u201d cloud companies. With last year\u2019s\nannouncement by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that they would begin charging\ncustomers for every IPv4 address used, that dynamic may change. AWS users may\nbuy their own addresses to Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP), or they may lease for a\nfew years while migrating to IPv6.\n\n#### IPv6\n\nIPv6 is the newer (dating to the 1990s) Internet Protocol. With 340 trillion\ntrillion trillion possible addresses, there is no scarcity, so it is\nessentially free. However, those with IPv6-only can\u2019t communicate with those\nwith IPv4-only unless someone installs a translator. IPv6 adoption is wide,\nwith 45% of hits on Google properties using the newer protocol, but\nprojections still put it ten years away from being above 90% of the internet.\n\nOther pricing risks to IPv4 include potential surges in supply from the U.S.\ngovernment\u2019s hoard of a few hundred million addresses, an effort to reclassify\n240M experimental addresses, or other publicly traded companies feeling\npressure from shareholders based on Cogent\u2019s offering. Indeed, prices have\nrecently eased, and there are signs that will continue, at least until prices\nof large and medium blocks converge.\n\nA Message from Our Sponsor\n\nHow to Take Advantage of Rising IPv4 Address Value: IPv4.Global specializes in\nhelping clients sell, lease and buy IPv4.
