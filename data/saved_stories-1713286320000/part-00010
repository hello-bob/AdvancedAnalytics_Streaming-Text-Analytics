The chart shows instances of \"delve\" used in articles such as\npeer-reviewed journal papers and preprints from 1990 to 2024.\n\n\"Delve\" has gone from below 2,000 instances in 2022 to close to 18,000 in\n2024, Shapira's analysis shows.\n\nAI Phrase Finder, which used a dataset of 50,000 ChatGPT responses, found that\n\"delve\" was in the top 10 words used by ChatGPT. Other common words used by\nthe chatbot included \"explore,\" \"captivate,\" and \"tapestry.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"If scientific authors use ChatGPT to assist them in writing their papers,\nthen it is likely that these common ChatGPT words will appear,\" Shapira wrote\nin a blog. \"Especially in introductions, abstracts, and possibly titles.\"\n\nThe Y Combinator cofounder said in a reply on the post that he disliked the\nword because no one actually used it when speaking English.\n\n\"It's one of those words like 'burgeoning' that people only use when they're\nwriting and want to sound clever,\" Graham wrote.\n\nPeople online weren't totally sold on Graham's conclusion. Some said it\nwrongly accused people with a large vocabulary of using AI.\n\nUsers on X also said the word \"delve\" was commonly used among non-native\nEnglish speakers, specifically Nigerians.\n\n> Kindly delve into this https://t.co/8oaUvOXdor pic.twitter.com/151pVWVL22\n>\n> \u2014 Sanitarian Temitope AgboolaTM (@topgee992) April 9, 2024\n\nAnother user, @leyeConnect, responded to Graham's post on X saying he felt\nconcerned that \"there will be discrimination against people with specific\nverbal characteristics or word choice.\"\n\nThis particular scenario, he said, showed the unintended consequences of AI.\nHe said people who used technical or esoteric terms \"will have to unlearn\nthose words lest their output is wrongly classified as AI-generated.\"\n\nIn response to one user who said many people used written-first words if they\ndidn't grow up in an English-speaking country, Graham said that \"kids now\nlearn English from movies.\"\n\nGraham didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAxel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, has a global deal to allow\nOpenAI to train its models on its media brands' reporting.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: What is ChatGPT, and should we be afraid of AI chatbots?\n\nTech ChatGPT\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
