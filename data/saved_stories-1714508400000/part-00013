Dado Galdieri/AmazonFace\n\nThe Amazon plays an essential role in climate, absorbing a quarter of all the\ncarbon stored in the world\u2019s forests. But no one knows how the world\u2019s largest\nrainforest will respond to the increasing amounts of carbon emitted into the\natmosphere by humans. Will it absorb more carbon and thrive, or will it reach\na tipping point and become a savanna?\n\nEven less is known about the effects of high emissions on the forest\u2019s\nunderstory\u2014the lower layer of vegetation formed by small trees and shrubs\ntopping out between the forest canopy and the floor.\n\nThough it absorbs just under half as much carbon as the canopy, this layer\nplays an important role in the forest. All trees pass through this layer while\ngrowing, and other plant species live there throughout their lives.\n\n\u201cThese plants are important in ecological relationships,\u201d said Sabrina Garcia,\na biologist at the National Institute for Amazonian Research, a research\ncenter linked to the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation.\n\u201cThey provide food for animals and also have their share in the carbon sink.\u201d\nGarcia is the colead author of a new paper in Plant, Cell and Environment\nstudying how the forest understory responds to elevated carbon dioxide (CO_2)\nlevels.\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\nThe new study is part of the larger project AmazonFace. This multimillion\ndollar open-air experiment in the Brazilian Amazon will release carbon into\nthe tree canopy via 35-meter-high metal towers to study how the rainforest\nresponds. The first tests are set to run later this year. In the meantime, the\nresearchers from the international consortium running the experiment began\nsetting up smaller open-top chambers in the forest in 2019.\n\nAmazonFace researchers set up transparent chambers to pump carbon dioxide\naround plants in the lower layers of the forest.

Researchers used these tools to test the\nresponse of the forest\u2019s lower layers to carbon-saturated air.\n\n\u201cTo see a study like this from a really important ecosystem in the central\nAmazon is very exciting,\u201d said David Ellsworth, an ecologist at Western Sydney\nUniversity, Australia, who was not involved in the research.\n\nEllsworth, who spent 30 years studying the Amazon and is a leader in\nexperiments exposing vegetation to elevated CO_2 levels, is impressed with the\nlogistics of setting up the chambers in the forest. So far, most experiments\nusing this technique were done on clearings and crops. \u201cTo do research like\nthis in the forest is amazing, because it is logically so difficult to do this\nkind of study.\u201d\n\n### Life in the Shadows\n\nPlants in the understory live practically in the shadows. Typically, only\nabout 5% of sunlight filters down from the canopy.\n\nResearchers hypothesized that plants in the understory would be particularly\ngood at soaking carbon from the air because they live in a constant state of\n\u201chunger\u201d for light. Their idea was that these plants would use the extra gas,\nfor example, to grow larger leaves with more surface area for capturing light.\n\n> \u201cThey are taking the extra CO_2 and depositing it in some structures, for\n> example, increasing their leaf surface.\u201d\n\nHowever, studies to test this hypothesis have been scarce and have mostly been\ndone with seedlings growing in pots. In the new study, the researchers set up\neight open-top chambers in the forest, half under normal conditions and the\nother half injected with air containing 250 parts per million of CO_2. This\namount corresponds to the extra gas that predictions suggest will be in the\natmosphere 50 years from now if emissions follow current trends.\n\nFor a year, they measured the plants\u2019 leaf areas, stem diameters, heights, and\ngrowth rates. They found that the plants in the understory absorbed the carbon\nand used it to grow: In 4 months, the understory plants exposed to the extra\ngas absorbed 67% more carbon and produced 85% more leaves than the other\nplants.\n\nThe researchers think the gas is helping the plants better exploit the erratic\nSun flecks they get for photosynthesis. \u201cThey are taking the extra CO_2 and\ndepositing it in some structures, for example, increasing their leaf surface,\u201d\nsaid colead author Amanda Damasceno, a master\u2019s student at the National\nInstitute for Amazonian Research at the time of the experiment.\n\n### Uncertain Future\n\nThe results might sound like good news at first glance. But the authors\nhighlighted that these effects might change in the long run. As temperatures\nrise with the expected advance of climate change, the plants might not absorb\ncarbon and grow in the same way.\n\n\u201cWill this increase in carbon absorption be, in fact, beneficial for the\nplants?\u201d Damasceno asked. \u201cTo what extent will the plants respond?\u201d\n\nPlants exposed to extra carbon dioxide showed higher photosynthesis and growth\nrates.

Just like us, plants sweat.\nThey release water through their stomata, small pore-like holes in their\nleaves, to keep their temperature stable. They use these same structures to\nabsorb carbon from the air. Scientists have conjectured that plants could\nchange their transpiration rates in carbon-saturated environments.\n\nWhen there is a lot of CO_2 in the air, the plants don\u2019t need to open their\nstomata much to absorb the gas. In return, they reduce their transpiration and\nthe amount of water they release into the air.\n\nIn the new study, the understory plants maintained their normal transpiration\nrates. However, Garcia worries that this could change in the long term,\npossibly altering the region\u2019s rain regime. \u201cFor now, the understory plants\nhave been shown to be efficient in water use, being able to absorb carbon\nwithout losing water,\u201d said Garcia. \u201cBut this could be a one-off effect.\u201d\n\n### Sweating Rain\n\nAmazonian plants are rainmakers. Their transpiration forms so-called flying\nrivers, kilometers-long streams of moisture that circulate via air currents\npassing over fields, forests, and cities in South America. The humidity these\nrivers carry is responsible for much of the rain that falls on the continent.\n\nPlants in the Amazon\u2019s understory don\u2019t absorb as much carbon as the forest\ncanopy, but they still play an important role in the rainforest ecosystem.\nCredit: Dado Galdieri/AmazonFace\n\nSeveral studies over the years have suggested that in a carbon-saturated\nenvironment with extreme climate change, the Amazon could become a dry\nsavanna, reducing rainfall in South America. Under this scenario, the\nlandscape would become a carbon source rather than a carbon sink.\n\nThe researchers will continue tracking the longer-term effects in the\nexperimental area, and they will rely on the results of the larger AmazonFace\nexperiment to gain a more complete picture of the forest\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWe know so little about the climate and the CO_2 responses of tropical\nvegetation in general and the Amazonian specifically that anything that we do\nscientifically is a leap forward,\u201d said Ellsworth. \u201cThis study is a great\nstepping stone.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sofia Moutinho (@sofiamoutinhoBR), Science Writer\n\n29 April 2024: The article was updated to provide the correct year in which\nresearchers began to set up open-top chambers in the Amazon.\n\n##### Citation: Moutinho, S.
