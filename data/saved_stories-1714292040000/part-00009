Officers had shocked him with a\nTaser and pinned him as he pleaded that he couldn\u2019t breathe. Now he sat on the\nground with hands cuffed behind his back and took in oxygen through a mask.\n\nThen, officers moved Jackson to his side so a medic could inject him with a\npotent knockout drug.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to calm you down,\u201d an officer assured Jackson. Within\nminutes, Jackson\u2019s heart stopped. He never regained consciousness and died two\nweeks later.\n\nAn investigation led by The Associated Press found at least 94 people died\nafter they were given sedatives and restrained by police from 2012 through\n2021. About half of the 94 who died were Black, including Demetrio Jackson.\n(AP Video: Shelby Lum)\n\nJackson\u2019s 2021 death illustrates an often-hidden way fatal U.S. police\nencounters end: not with the firing of an officer\u2019s gun but with the silent\nuse of a medical syringe.\n\nThe practice of giving sedatives to people detained by police has spread\nquietly across the nation over the last 15 years, built on questionable\nscience and backed by police-aligned experts, an investigation led by The\nAssociated Press has found. Based on thousands of pages of law enforcement and\nmedical records and videos of dozens of incidents, the investigation shows how\na strategy intended to reduce violence and save lives has resulted in some\navoidable deaths.\n\nAt least 94 people died after they were given sedatives and restrained by\npolice from 2012 through 2021, according to findings by the AP in\ncollaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS) and the Howard Centers for Investigative\nJournalism. That\u2019s nearly 10% of the more than 1,000 deaths identified during\nthe investigation of people subdued by police in ways that are not supposed to\nbe fatal. About half of the 94 who died were Black, including Jackson.\n\nLETHAL RESTRAINT INVESTIGATION Many more people have died after police subdued\nthem than the American public knows.\n\n\\- The AP found that over a decade, more than 1,000 people died after police\nsubdued them with physical force that is not supposed to be lethal. Explore\nthe full database of cases here. - A mom called 911 to get her son mental\nhealth help. He died after police pinned him to the ground and a paramedic\ninjected a potent sedative.\n\nBehind the racial disparity is a disputed medical condition called excited\ndelirium, which fueled the rise of sedation outside hospitals. Critics say its\npurported symptoms, including \u201csuperhuman strength\u201d and high pain tolerance,\nplay into racist stereotypes about Black people and lead to biased decisions\nabout who needs sedation.\n\nThe use of sedatives in half these incidents has never been reported, as\nscrutiny typically focuses on the actions of police, not medics. Elijah\nMcClain\u2019s 2019 death in Aurora, Colorado, was a rare exception: Two paramedics\nwere convicted of giving McClain an overdose of ketamine, the same drug given\nto Jackson. One was sentenced last month to five years in prison and the other\nwas sentenced Friday to 14 months in jail and probation.\n\nIt was impossible to determine the role sedatives may have played in each of\nthe 94 deaths, which often involved the use of other potentially dangerous\nforce on people who had taken drugs or consumed alcohol. Medical experts told\nthe AP their impact could be negligible in people who were already dying; the\nfinal straw that triggered heart or breathing failure in the medically\ndistressed; or the main cause of death when given in the wrong circumstances\nor mishandled.\n\nWhile sedatives were mentioned as a cause or contributing factor in a dozen\nofficial death rulings, authorities often didn\u2019t even investigate whether\ninjections were appropriate. Medical officials have traditionally viewed them\nas mostly benign treatments. Now some say they may be playing a bigger role\nthan previously understood and deserve more scrutiny.\n\nTime and time again, the AP found, agitated people who were held by police\nfacedown, often handcuffed and with officers pushing on their backs, struggled\nto breathe and tried to get free. Citing combativeness, paramedics\nadministered sedatives, further slowing their breathing. Cardiac and\nrespiratory arrest often occurred within minutes.\n\nIn this image from Altoona Police Department body-camera video, police\nrestrain Demetrio Jackson in a parking lot on the border of Altoona and Eau\nClaire, Wis., on Oct. 8, 2021, minutes before a paramedic injects him with\nketamine.(Altoona Police Department via AP)\n\nParamedics drugged some people who were not a threat to themselves or others,\nviolating treatment guidelines. Medics often didn\u2019t know whether other drugs\nor alcohol were in people\u2019s systems, although some combinations cause serious\nside effects.\n\nPolice officers sometimes improperly encouraged paramedics to give shots to\nsuspects they were detaining.\n\nResponders occasionally joked about the medications\u2019 power to knock their\nsubjects out. \u201cNight, night\u201d is heard on videos before deaths in California,\nTennessee and Florida.\n\nEmergency medical workers, \u201cif they aren\u2019t careful, can simply become an\nextension of the police\u2019s handcuffs, of their weapons, of their nightsticks,\u201d\nsaid Claire Zagorski, a former paramedic and an addiction researcher at the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin.\n\nSupporters say sedatives enable rapid treatment for drug-related behavioral\nemergencies and psychotic episodes, protect front-line responders from\nviolence and are safely administered thousands of times annually to get people\nwith life-threatening conditions to hospitals. Critics say forced sedation\nshould be strictly limited or banned, arguing the medications, given without\nconsent, are too risky to be administered during police encounters.\n\nOhio State University professor Dr. Mark DeBard was an important early\nproponent of sedation, believing it could be used in rare cases when officers\nencountered extremely agitated people who needed rapid medical treatment.\nToday, he said he\u2019s frustrated officers still sometimes use excessive force\ninstead of treating those incidents as medical emergencies. He\u2019s also\nsurprised paramedics have given unnecessary injections by overdiagnosing\nexcited delirium.\n\nOthers say the premise was flawed, with sedatives and police restraint\ncreating a dangerous mix. The deaths have left a trail of grieving relatives\nfrom coast to coast.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re running around on the streets administering these heavy-duty\nmedications that could be lethal,\u201d said Honey Gutzalenko, a nurse whose\nhusband died after he was injected with midazolam in 2021 while restrained by\npolice near San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right.\u201d\n\n## \u2018I\u2019M BEGGING YOU TO STOP\u2019\n\nJackson was standing on a truck outside a radio station on the border of the\nsmall Wisconsin cities of Eau Claire and Altoona. An employee called 911\nbefore dawn on Oct. 8, 2021, hoping officers could shoo away a stranger who\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be a threat, but not normal either.\u201d\n\nPolice video and hundreds of pages of law enforcement and medical records show\nhow the incident escalated.\n\nThis photo provided by Rita Gowens shows her son, Demetrio Jackson. (Courtesy\nRita Gowens via AP)\n\nAn Altoona police officer met Jackson in the parking lot. Jackson appeared\nuneasy and paranoid, looking around and talking softly. He had taken\nmethamphetamine, which a psychiatrist said he used to self-medicate for\nschizophrenia. He\u2019d been in and out of jail and living on the streets, with\nfrequent visits to the emergency room seeking a place to rest.\n\nThe officer, joined by a second Altoona officer and a sheriff\u2019s deputy, told\nhim he could leave if he gave his name. Jackson refused.\n\nPolice identified him through his tattoos, learning he was on probation for\nmeth possession. They noticed the truck had minor damage and decided to arrest\nhim.\n\nJackson took off running. The officers chased Jackson, who stopped seconds\nlater and staggered toward the first officer. Body-camera video shows she\nfired her Taser, its darts striking Jackson in the stomach and thigh. He\nscreamed after the electrical shock and collapsed.\n\nWhen officers couldn\u2019t handcuff Jackson, she fired additional darts, striking\nJackson in the back as he lay on the ground. Officers from the Eau Claire\nPolice Department forced Jackson onto his stomach to be handcuffed and\nrestrained him in what\u2019s known as the prone position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m begging you to stop,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, officers moved him to his side and then sat him up,\ntrying to improve his breathing.\n\nAn officer wondered aloud whether Jackson had \u201cexcited delirium\u201d and asked a\ncolleague if paramedics were \u201cgoing to stand around and do nothing.\u201d He voiced\napproval when one arrived with ketamine, adding Jackson would not like it\n\u201cwhen he gets poked.\u201d\n\nThe Eau Claire Fire Department\u2019s excited delirium protocol advises, \u201cRapid\nsedation is the key to de-escalation!!!!!\u201d The medic measured 400 milligrams\nafter estimating the 6-foot-tall Jackson weighed 175 pounds, enough to\nimmobilize someone within minutes. He injected the medicine into Jackson\u2019s\nbuttocks.\n\nFive medical experts who reviewed the case for AP said Jackson\u2019s behavior did\nnot appear to be dangerous enough to justify the intervention.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe he was a candidate for ketamine,\u201d said Connecticut paramedic\nPeter Canning, who said he supports sedating truly violent patients because\nthey stop fighting and are sleeping by the time they get to the hospital.\n\nMinutes later, Jackson stopped breathing on the way to Sacred Heart Hospital.\nHe\u2019d suffered cardiac arrest and, after he was resuscitated, had no brain\nfunction.\n\nJackson\u2019s mother, Rita Gowens, collapsed while shopping at an Indiana Walmart\nwhen she learned her oldest son was hospitalized and not expected to survive.\n\nThis photo provided by Rita Gowens shows her son, Demetrio Jackson, at the\nSacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire, Wis., in October 2021. (Rita Gowens via\nAP)\n\nGowens rushed to the hospital 500 miles away, where she was told he\u2019d been\ninjected with ketamine. She searched online and was stunned to read it\u2019s used\nto tranquilize horses.\n\nGowens spoke to Jackson, held his hand and hoped for a miracle. She eventually\nagreed to remove him from a ventilator after his condition didn\u2019t improve,\nsinging into his ear as he took his final breaths: \u201cYou\u2019ve never lost a\nbattle, and I know, I know, you never will.\u201d\n\nShe still has nightmares about how police and medics treated her son, whom she\nrecalls as a happy boy with chunky cheeks that inspired the nickname\n\u201cMeatball.\u201d There are few days when she doesn\u2019t ask, \u201cWhy did they give him an\nanimal tranquilizer?\u201d\n\n## KETAMINE MOVES TO THE STREETS\n\nThe practice of using ketamine to subdue people outside hospitals began in\n2004 when a disturbed man scaled a fence, cut himself with a broken bottle and\npaced along a narrow strip of concrete on a Minneapolis highway bridge.\n\nThe man was in danger of falling into traffic below when officers reached\nthrough the fence and grabbed him.\n\nDr. John Hick, who worked with first responders, heard the emergency radio\nchatter while driving and rushed to the scene with an idea. Hick gave the man\ntwo shots of ketamine, started an IV and kept him breathing with an air mask.\n\nThe man stopped struggling, and responders lowered him to safety.\n\nParamedics had occasionally used other sedatives to calm combative people\nsince the 1980s. Hick and his Hennepin County Medical Center colleague Dr.\nJeffrey Ho believed ketamine worked faster and had fewer side effects, showing\npromise to avert fatal police encounters.\n\nHo was a leading researcher on Taser safety and an expert witness for the\ncompany in wrongful death lawsuits. In a 2007 deposition in one such case, he\nargued for a potentially \u201clife-saving tactic\u201d of having sedative injections\nquickly follow Taser shocks, saying the combination could shorten struggles\nthat, if prolonged, might end in death.\n\nFILE - A vial of ketamine is displayed for a photograph in Chicago on July 25,\n2018. (AP Photo/Teresa Crawford, File)\n\nSome doctors at his public hospital in Minneapolis were using \u201csomething\ncalled ketamine, which is an analog to LSD,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of an animal\ntranquilizer.\u201d\n\nThe drug became more common outside the hospital in 2008 when Hennepin County\nparamedics were given permission to use it.\n\nAn American College of Emergency Physicians panel that included Ho said in\n2009 that ketamine had shown \u201cexcellent results and safety\u201d while\nacknowledging no research proved it would save lives.\n\nIn time, its use became standard from Las Vegas to Columbus, Ohio, to Palm\nBeach County, Florida. The earliest death involving ketamine documented in\nAP\u2019s investigation came in 2015, when 34-year-old Juan Carrizales was injected\nafter struggling with police in the Dallas suburb of Garland, Texas.\n\nThis image provided by Robert Cutler shows his son, David Cutler. (Courtesy\nRobert Cutler via AP)\n\nShortly after ketamine became authorized for such use in Arizona in 2017,\ndeputies who were restraining David Cutler facedown in handcuffs in the\nscorching desert asked a paramedic to sedate him.\n\nThe medic testified he was surprised when Cutler stopped breathing, although\nthe dose was larger than recommended for someone weighing 132 pounds. He said\nhe had been trained that ketamine didn\u2019t impact respiration. Cutler\u2019s death\nwas ruled an accident due to heat exposure and LSD \u2014 though that was disputed\nby experts hired by Cutler\u2019s family, who said heat stroke along with ketamine\ncaused his death.\n\nIn Minneapolis, an oversight agency found the use of ketamine during police\ncalls rose dramatically from 2012 through 2017 and body-camera video showed\ninstances of officers appearing to pressure paramedics to use ketamine and\njoking about its power. The department told officers they could never \u201csuggest\nor demand\u201d the use of sedation.\n\nFacing criticism, Hennepin Healthcare halted a study examining the\neffectiveness of ketamine on agitated patients. The Food and Drug\nAdministration later found the research failed to protect vulnerable,\nintoxicated people who had not given consent.\n\nBy 2021, the American College of Emergency Physicians warned ketamine impacted\nbreathing and the heart more than previously believed.\n\n\u201cKetamine is not as benign as we might have hoped it to be,\u201d a co-author of\nthe new position, Dr. Jeffrey Goodloe, said on the group\u2019s podcast in 2022.\n\nHe said the practice of giving large doses of ketamine, sometimes too much for\nsmaller patients, had spread nationwide as agencies copied each other\u2019s\nprotocols with little independent review.\n\nBut the AP\u2019s findings show risks of sedation go beyond ketamine, which was\nused in at least 19 cases.\n\nRoughly half of the 94 deaths documented by the AP came after the use of\nmidazolam, which has long been known to heighten the risk of respiratory\ndepression. Many came during police encounters in California, where ketamine\nis not widely used. Midazolam, a common pre-surgery drug known by the brand\nname Versed, is also part of a three-drug cocktail used in some states to\nexecute prisoners.\n\nOther cases involved a range of other drugs, including the antipsychotic\nmedications haloperidol and ziprasidone, which can cause irregular heartbeats.\n\nThe need for monitoring side effects is often laid out for paramedics in\nwritten guidelines, many of which are based on the disputed belief that\nexcited delirium can cause sudden death.\n\n## THE HISTORY OF \u2018EXCITED DELIRIUM\u2019\n\nThe theory of excited delirium was troubling from the start.\n\nIn the 1980s, with cocaine use soaring, Dr. Charles Wetli, a Miami forensic\npathologist, coined the term to explain a handful of deaths of violent cocaine\nusers, many of whom had been restrained by police. Wetli, who died in 2020,\nalso blamed excited delirium for the mysterious deaths of more than a dozen\nBlack women. He said cocaine and sexual activity triggered the fatal\ncondition.\n\nThe women\u2019s deaths eventually were attributed to a serial killer. Wetli\u2019s\ntheory survived. And over time, symptoms described by Wetli and others \u2014\n\u201csuperhuman strength,\u201d animal-like noises and high pain tolerance \u2014 became\ndisproportionately assigned to Black people. The terms spread to police and\nemergency medical services to describe certain agitated people \u2014 and explain\nsudden deaths.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, police were encountering more drug users and mentally ill\npeople as stimulant use increased and psychiatric hospitals closed.\nDepartments adopted Tasers as a less-lethal alternative to firearms, but there\nwas a problem \u2014 hundreds died after being jolted.\n\nSupporters of Wetli\u2019s research, including the medical examiner in Miami-Dade\nCounty, ruled again and again that excited delirium was the cause of these\ndeaths, not the effects of the weapons and other physical force. Executives at\nTaser\u2019s manufacturer agreed, promoting excited delirium to medical examiners\naround the country and retaining experts who explained the concept to juries\nin wrongful death lawsuits.\n\nIn 2006, a grand jury that investigated Taser-related deaths in Miami-Dade\nrecommended an untested treatment that it said could save people before they\ndied from excited delirium: squirting midazolam up their noses to cause\n\u201calmost immediate sedation.\u201d Its report acknowledged they \u201cmay experience\ndifficulty in breathing.\u201d Miami-Dade paramedics adopted this treatment.\n\nBut key medical groups didn\u2019t recognize excited delirium, and activists were\ncalling for limits on Taser use. What happened next would help promote\nsedation alongside Tasers as tools to gain control.\n\nIn 2008, the biggest names in excited delirium research gathered at a Las\nVegas hotel for a three-day meeting organized by a group with ties to Taser\u2019s\nmanufacturer.\n\n\u201cA lot of talk took place on chemical sedation because the cops didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with these people,\u201d recalled John Peters, president of the\nInstitute for the Prevention of In-Custody Deaths, which sponsored the\nmeeting. \u201cJeff Ho had done some work up in Minnesota. He said, \u2018Look. I\u2019ve\nbeen using ketamine. It knocks them out quicker.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe timing was fortuitous: The American College of Emergency Physicians would\nsoon form a task force to study excited delirium and how police and medics\nshould respond.\n\nThe 19-member panel included Ho, who became Taser\u2019s medical director under an\narrangement in which the company paid part of his hospital salary; Dr. Donald\nDawes, a Taser research consultant; and University of Miami researcher Deborah\nMash, who testified for Taser about several deaths she blamed on excited\ndelirium. At least two other panelists were routinely retained by officers and\ntheir departments as expert witnesses.\n\nThe panel\u2019s 2009 paper disclosed none of these relationships. It found excited\ndelirium was real, could result in death regardless of whether someone was\nshocked with a Taser and called for \u201caggressive chemical sedation\u201d to treat\nthe symptoms.\n\nDeBard, the now-retired Ohio doctor who chaired the panel, told AP he\nrecruited relevant experts to join and that disclosure of conflicts wasn\u2019t\nrequired by the ER doctors group then. He said Taser didn\u2019t influence the\noutcome, which reflected the panel\u2019s consensus. Mash said she had no conflict\nbecause Taser didn\u2019t fund her research. Dawes declined an interview request.\nHo didn\u2019t return messages.\n\nTaser rebranded itself in 2017 as Axon. A spokesperson for the company\ndeclined interview requests and did not respond to written questions.\n\nDr. Brooks Walsh, an emergency physician in Connecticut who was not on the\npanel, said the 2009 paper reinforced racial bias as it formalized \u201cloaded\nterms\u201d used to describe excited delirium, influencing how the diagnosis would\nbe applied.\n\nHo and other Taser- and police-aligned experts joined a federally sponsored\npanel in 2011 that built on the work, recommending four actions on a checklist\nfor officers and paramedics: Identify excited delirium symptoms; control (with\na Taser if necessary); sedate; and transport to a hospital.\n\nNo test measures for excited delirium, so paramedics faced a judgment call:\nWhich patients were so agitated, strong, impervious to pain and dangerous that\nthey needed to be sedated?\n\nDeBard said the symptoms were based on medical observations, not race. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019ve got somebody that\u2019s delirious, irrational, aggressive, hyperactive,\nrunning around naked, I mean, it\u2019s really pretty easy\u201d to recognize, he said.\n\nYet, over time, prominent medical groups and some experts pointed to overuse\nof sedation during police encounters and a disproportionate impact on Black\npeople. Even supporters of the practice have acknowledged that the wrong\npatients at times have been injected.\n\nThe deaths of Black men in police custody, including the 2020 killing of\nGeorge Floyd, put pressure on the medical community to re-examine excited\ndelirium. The ER doctors group in 2023 withdrew approval of the 2009 paper and\nsaid excited delirium shouldn\u2019t be used in court testimony. Some doctors\ncalled that decision political and note the group still recognizes a similar\ncondition \u2014 hyperactive delirium with severe agitation \u2014 that can be treated\nwith sedation. But today no major medical association legitimizes excited\ndelirium.\n\n## \u2018CONVENIENT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT\u2019\n\nIn more than a dozen cases reviewed by AP, police asked for or suggested the\nuse of sedatives, calling into question whether medics were working for law\nenforcement or in patients\u2019 interests. Officers often suggested their\ndetainees had excited delirium.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, law and bioethics professor Osagie\nObasogie, who has studied excited delirium and sedation, said officers should\nbe banned from influencing medical care.\n\n\u201cWe need to be sure that folks are treated in a way that meets their medical\nneeds and not simply given a chemical restraint because it\u2019s convenient for\nlaw enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficers are told not to dictate medical treatment but \u201csome knuckleheads\u201d\nhave done otherwise, said Peters, whose group hosted the 2008 Las Vegas\nmeeting that focused on excited delirium.\n\nParamedics say they make medical decisions independently from police,\nfollowing guidelines that call for sedating people who may be dangerous. But\nin several cases AP found, people were injected though they had calmed down or\neven passed out after struggles with police.\n\nIvan Gutzalenko, a 47-year-old father, was struggling to breathe as two\nofficers restrained him in Richmond, California. Gutzalenko told the officers\nthey were hurting him, and bucked to try to get one off his back.\n\nA paramedic viewed Gutzalenko\u2019s action as aggression, and went to his\nambulance to get a 5-milligram dose of midazolam. When he returned three\nminutes later, Gutzalenko lay motionless. \u201cHe\u2019s faking like he\u2019s unconscious,\u201d\nan officer said.\n\nThe medic plunged the needle into his bicep. Gutzalenko\u2019s heart stopped. He\nwas declared dead at a hospital. A pathologist testified that midazolam was\ngiven to \u201cquiet him down\u201d during an episode of excited delirium but did not\ncontribute to the death, which he blamed on prone restraint and meth use.\n\nIn this composite image from Richmond Police Department body-camera video,\npolice restrain Ivan Gutzalenko in Richmond, Calif., on March 10, 2021.\n(Richmond Police Department via AP)\n\nHis wife said Gutzalenko, a former critical care nurse, would never have\nconsented to receive midazolam that day.\n\n\u201cI know from being a registered nurse since 2004, you don\u2019t administer a\nsedative to someone who is clearly already in respiratory distress,\u201d she said,\nadding that his death has been devastating to their two teenage children.\n\nDr. Gail Van Norman, a University of Washington professor of anesthesiology\nand pain medicine, said it\u2019s dangerous for officers to put pressure on the\nbacks and necks of detainees before and after they\u2019re injected with sedatives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for disaster, because you may have created a situation in which\nyou are impeding a person\u2019s ability to get oxygen,\u201d she said.\n\nThe AP investigation found half who died following sedation had been shocked\nwith a Taser and the majority had been restrained facedown.\n\nTheir blood acid levels may already have been spiking from drugs, adrenaline\nand pain while oxygen levels may have been plummeting \u2014 life-threatening\nconditions called acidosis and hypoxia.\n\nSedatives can dull the instinct to compensate by breathing quickly and heavily\nto blow off carbon dioxide, essential for the heart to beat, said Dr.\nChristopher Stephens, a UTHealth Houston anesthesiologist and former\nparamedic.\n\nUnder sedation, he said, the body doesn\u2019t respond as efficiently to the\nbuildup of carbon dioxide. \u201cYour brain doesn\u2019t care as much about it,\u201d\nStephens said. \u201cAnd they can go into respiratory and cardiac arrest.\u201d\n\nParamedics usually have no idea whether their patients have alcohol, opioids\nor other depressants in their bodies that increase sedatives\u2019 effects on\nbreathing.\n\nThis photo provided Anthony LaCour shows his wife, Jerica LaCour, of Colorado\nSprings, Colo., holding one of their five children. (Anthony LaCour via AP)\n\nMore than a dozen who died had been drinking, including Jerica LaCour, 29, a\nColorado Springs, Colorado, mother of five young children.\n\nShe was stressed about family finances, husband Anthony LaCour recalled, when\ndeputies found her trespassing at a trucking company.\n\n\u201cGuess who gets ketamine?\u201d paramedic Jason Poulson of AMR, the nation\u2019s\nlargest ambulance company, said as LaCour was restrained on a gurney,\naccording to body-camera footage.\n\nAn EMT said in a report that she told Poulson that LaCour had calmed and\ndidn\u2019t need ketamine, and later warned that LaCour was no longer breathing. In\na disciplinary agreement with state regulators, Poulson admitted he was\nunsuccessful in protecting LaCour\u2019s airway despite multiple attempts,\nmishandled the syringe and failed to document the ketamine use properly. His\nstate certification was put on probation.\n\nAMR and Poulson denied responsibility for LaCour\u2019s death in court filings,\narguing LaCour was experiencing excited delirium and ketamine was appropriate.\nThis week they settled a long-pending wrongful death lawsuit, LaCour family\nattorney Daniel Kay said Friday. He said the settlement amount was\nconfidential and the proceeds would help her children. AMR didn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to a request for comment and a man who answered a cellphone number\nlisted for Poulson hung up on a reporter.\n\n## AFTER DEATH, SEDATION GOES UNQUESTIONED\n\nWhen people died, the use of sedation often went unacknowledged publicly and\nunquestioned by investigators.\n\nAfter Jackson\u2019s death in Wisconsin, police press releases said nothing about\nketamine. State police redacted mention of the drug from investigation records\nand blurred video of the prone restraint and injection, saying his family\u2019s\nprivacy outweighed the public interest in disclosure.\n\nThe fire department, which declined comment, blacked out the information in\nits incident report. But when AP uploaded the document, redactions\ndisappeared, revealing Jackson was given 400 milligrams of ketamine.\n\nAn autopsy concluded Jackson died from complications caused by meth. The\nreport said Jackson\u2019s ketamine dose was 100 milligrams, a quarter of what the\nfire department report said.\n\nRita Gowens speaks about her son, Demetrio Jackson, Monday, Feb. 27, 2023, in\nAnderson, Ind. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings)\n\nTwo longtime forensic pathologists who reviewed the case for AP said meth use\nwasn\u2019t the only factor. Dr. Joye Carter said she believed the police\naltercation and ketamine caused the death, saying the sedative can cause heart\nproblems when given to a meth user.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn said the level of meth in Jackson\u2019s blood was high but\ngenerally not lethal. He said Jackson likely died from high blood acid levels,\nwith police restraint and possibly ketamine contributing.\n\nThe autopsy was performed in Ramsey County, Minnesota. A county spokesperson\ndefended the findings from a now-retired medical examiner, saying the\ndiscrepancy on the ketamine dose wasn\u2019t significant.\n\nCiting the autopsy\u2019s finding that meth was the cause, Eau Claire County\nDistrict Attorney Peter Rindal ruled Jackson\u2019s case was not an \u201cofficer-\ninvolved death\u201d under Wisconsin law and closed the investigation.\n\nIn nearly 90% of the deaths examined by AP, coroners and medical examiners did\nnot list sedation as a cause or contributing factor. Some autopsy reports\nfailed to document that the deceased had been sedated.\n\nThe most common ruling was an accidental death in which other drugs, often\nmeth or cocaine, were causes or contributing factors. More than a quarter were\nat least partially attributed to excited delirium.\n\nMedical examiners view sedatives as safe treatments to control patients and\nwouldn\u2019t question their use unless there was a grievous error, said Dr. James\nGill, the chief medical examiner of Connecticut and past president of the\nNational Association of Medical Examiners.\n\n\u201cGenerally we\u2019re going to default then back to what\u2019s the underlying disease\nor injury that started this chain of events,\u201d Gill said.\n\nHe said sedatives rarely cause deaths by themselves but additional studies\ncould look at whether they play a role in fatal police struggles where many\nfactors are involved.\n\nEven when autopsies implicated sedatives, investigations didn\u2019t always follow.\n\nIn LaCour\u2019s case, the coroner found she died from \u201crespiratory arrest\nassociated with acute alcohol and ketamine intoxication.\u201d The district\nattorney\u2019s office said it had no record of reviewing her death.\n\nNine miles from LaCour\u2019s injection, a paramedic injected 26-year-old Hunter\nBarr with ketamine as officers held him facedown in the dirt outside his\nColorado Springs home in September 2020.\n\nRetired postal worker Mark Barr had called 911 for help controlling his son,\nwho he said wasn\u2019t violent but was having a bad reaction to LSD. He watched as\na medic gave two injections just minutes apart. He said he couldn\u2019t figure out\nwhy the second injection was necessary, saying his son was subdued. Hunter\nBarr became unconscious on the way to a hospital and died within hours.\n\nThe coroner ruled Barr died from the effects of ketamine. The Colorado Springs\nPolice Department closed the case as \u201cnon-criminal\u201d and the DA\u2019s office again\nhad no review.\n\nWhen deaths were investigated, inquiries usually focused on whether police\nused excessive force. In audio and video reviewed by AP, investigators seemed\nuninterested in how sedation may have contributed.\n\nThis family photo shows Giovani Berne of Palm Bay, Fla. (Courtesy Christina\nBerne via AP)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to get in the weeds with a whole bunch of that,\u201d an\ninvestigator told a paramedic explaining the ketamine injection he gave\n18-year-old Giovani Berne before Berne\u2019s heart stopped in Palm Bay, Florida,\nin 2016.\n\nBerne\u2019s sister, Christina, said the family didn\u2019t know he had been given\nketamine until contacted by AP years later, but \u201cwe knew something bad\nhappened in the ambulance.\u201d A medical examiner ruled that Berne died of\nexcited delirium.\n\nThe death of McClain, 23, in Colorado is the only one that resulted in charges\nagainst paramedics. Prosecutors argued Aurora paramedics Jeremy Cooper and\nPeter Cichuniec didn\u2019t assess McClain, gave him too much ketamine for someone\nhis size and didn\u2019t monitor him afterward.\n\nTheir convictions shook the EMS field, whose leaders say treatment mistakes\nshouldn\u2019t be criminalized. Defense attorneys argued the paramedics followed\ntheir training on excited delirium and ketamine. A judge gave Cichuniec five\nyears in prison while Cooper was sentenced Friday to 14 months in jail and\nprobation.\n\nLawyers console paramedic Peter Cichuniec after his sentence is read on\nFriday, March 1, 2024 in Brighton, Colo. (Colorado State Court via AP, Pool)\n\nCivil liability is also rare, in part because deaths have multiple causes and\nsome courts have ruled that unwilling injections aren\u2019t excessive force even\nwhen they cause harm. That hasn\u2019t stopped families from trying: A number of\nwrongful death lawsuits involving sedation are pending.\n\nLawmakers in Colorado banned excited delirium as a justification for using\nketamine and put other restrictions on the drug, but changes in the law\nelsewhere have been few.\n\nParamedic reformers are working to address the failures that increase the risk\nof sedatives contributing to deaths.\n\nParamedic Eric Jaeger helped rewrite New Hampshire\u2019s protocols and, at a fire\nstation in Hooksett, recently used Jackson\u2019s death as a training scenario\nafter evaluating the case for AP. He questioned whether sedation was\nnecessary. He said medics failed to thoroughly evaluate Jackson and should\nhave had monitoring equipment ready before any injection.\n\nHe said he had been aware of a handful of deaths but the number found by AP\n\u201cdramatically increases\u201d the scope.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t change the training, change the protocols, change the leadership\nto make the system safer,\u201d Jaeger said, \u201cthen we all bear responsibility for\nfuture deaths.\u201d\n\n## ___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner contributed from New York.\n\n___ The Associated Press receives support from the Public Welfare Foundation\nfor reporting focused on criminal justice.
