Credit: NASA/Kasey\nDillahay\n\nThe PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) mission has delivered its\nfirst operational data back to researchers, a feat made possible in part by\ninnovative, data-storing technology from NASA's Near Space Network, which\nintroduced two key enhancements for PACE and other upcoming science missions.\n\nAs a satellite orbits in space, its systems generate critical data about the\nspacecraft's health, location, battery life, and more. All of this occurs\nwhile the mission's science instruments capture images and data supporting the\nsatellite's overall objective.\n\nThis data is then encoded and sent back to Earth via radio waves through\nNASA's Near Space Network and Deep Space Network\u2014but not without challenges.\n\nOne challenge is extreme distances, where disruptions or delays are common.\nSatellite disruptions are similar to what internet users experience on Earth\nwith buffering or faulty links. If a disruption occurs, Delay/Disruption\nTolerant Networking, or DTN, can safely store and forward the data once a path\nopens.\n\nNASA's Near Space Network integrated DTN into four new antennas and the PACE\nspacecraft to showcase the benefit this technology can have for science\nmissions. The network, which supports communications for space-based mission\nwithin 1.2 million miles of Earth, is constantly enhancing its capabilities to\nsupport science and exploration missions.\n\nNASA\u2019s PACE satellite\u2019s Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) detects light across a\nhyperspectral range, which gives scientists new information to differentiate\ncommunities of phytoplankton \u2013 a unique ability of NASA\u2019s newest Earth-\nobserving satellite. This first image released from OCI identifies two\ndifferent communities of these microscopic marine organisms in the ocean off\nthe coast of South Africa on Feb. 28, 2024. The central panel of this image\nshows Synechococcus in pink and picoeukaryotes in green. The left panel of\nthis image shows a natural color view of the ocean, and the right panel\ndisplays the concentration of chlorophyll-a, a photosynthetic pigment used to\nidentify the presence of phytoplankton. Credit: NASA\n\n\"DTN is the future of space communications, providing robust protection of\ndata that could be lost due to a disruption,\" said Kevin Coggins, deputy\nassociate administrator for NASA's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN)\nprogram. \"PACE is the first operational science mission to leverage DTN, and\nwe are using it to transmit data to mission operators monitoring the\nbatteries, orbit, and more. This information is critical to mission\noperations.\"\n\nPACE, a satellite located about 250 miles above Earth, is collecting data to\nhelp researchers better understand how the ocean and atmosphere exchange\ncarbon dioxide, measure atmospheric variables associated with air quality and\nclimate, and monitor ocean health by studying phytoplankton\u2014tiny plants and\nalgae.\n\nWhile PACE is the first operational science user of DTN, demonstrations of the\ntechnology have been done previously on the International Space Station.\n\nIn addition to DTN, the Near Space Network worked with commercial partner,\nKongsberg Satellite Services in Norway to integrate four new antennas into the\nnetwork to support PACE.\n\nThe Near Space Network\u2019s new antennas in Alaska, Chile, Norway, and Virginia.\nThese were developed in partnership with KSAT. Credit: NASA\n\nThese new antennas, in Fairbanks, Alaska; Wallops Island, Virginia; Punta\nArenas, Chile; and Svalbard, Norway, allow missions to downlink terabytes of\nscience data at once. Just as scientists and engineers constantly improve\ntheir instrument capabilities, NASA also advances its communications systems\nto enable missions near Earth and in deep space.\n\nAs PACE orbits Earth, it will downlink its science data 12 to 15 times a day\nto three of the network's new antennas. Overall, the mission will send down\n3.5 terabytes of science data each day.\n\nNetwork capability techniques like DTN and the four new antennas are the\nlatest enhancements to the Near Space Network's catalog of services to support\nscience missions, human spaceflight, and technology experiments.\n\n\"NASA's Near Space Network now has unprecedented flexibility to get scientists\nand operations managers more of the precious information they need to ensure\ntheir mission's success,\" said Coggins.\n\nIn addition to these new capabilities, the network is also increasing the\nnumber of commercial antennas within its portfolio. In 2023, NASA issued the\nNear Space Network Services request for proposal to seek commercial providers\nfor integration into the network's expanding portfolio. With an increasing\ncapacity, the network can support additional science missions and downlink\nopportunities.\n\nProvided by NASA\n\nCitation: NASA's near space network enables PACE climate mission to 'phone\nhome' (2024, April 17) retrieved 27 April 2024 from\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-04-nasa-space-network-enables-pace.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
