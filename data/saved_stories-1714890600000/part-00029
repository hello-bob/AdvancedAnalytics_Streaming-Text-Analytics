She explained:\n\"If you don't know much about what happens in your last moments, some things\nhappen to most people.\"\n\n\"One of the things is called a death stare, which is when someone's focus gets\nreally stuck on part of the room, and no matter what you do - even if you snap\nfingers right in front of their face - they won't move their eyes.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Walmart ends major self-checkout rule after lengthy battle with\ntheft\n\nNurse Julie McFadden helps people understand death (Image: Getty)\n\n\"Sometimes they just gaze into space. Sometimes they chat to someone who isn't\nthere. Sometimes they have a big grin on their faces, like they're seeing\nsomething that's obviously bringing them joy. This is what we call the 'death\nstare'.\"\n\nJulie added that often along with the \"death stare\", people also experience\n\"end-of-life visions,\" where the person dying believes they see someone they\n\"usually love and recognise\" who has already \"passed away\", reports the Mirror\nUS.\n\nShe explained: \"They will sometimes have conversations right in front of us\nwith these people that we don't see,\" she said about the odd things that\nhappen.\n\nJulie told a story about visiting an old man who seemed close to dying and was\nseeing things that weren't there. His wife took care of him, and they were\nboth nearly 100 years old and had been together for 70 years.\n\n\"I instantly loved these two. They were so, so, so sweet,\" Julie recalled. \"He\nwas what I call 'pleasantly confused',\" she explained, which meant he knew his\nwife but didn't talk or understand much.\n\nDON'T MISS: April\u2019s solar eclipse prompts urgent warning from NASA [ANALYSIS]\nMassive, invasive Jor\u014d spiders that make six-foot webs are taking over the US\n[PICTURES] Scientists may have pinpointed how long Covid causes fatigue\n[LATEST]\n\nJulie says people experience certain events in the lead up to their death\n(Image: Getty)\n\n## Follow Daily Express US\n\nFollow Daily Express US on Facebook and X (Image: EXPRESS)\n\nGet all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our\ndedicated American team.\n\nFollow Daily Express US on Facebook and Twitter @ExpressUSNews\n\nJulie saw that he would smile at her, then look away as if he saw something\nelse, and then smile really big. \"And he kept doing it the whole time I was\nthere ... When he did that, I couldn't get him to look at me. Then he would\nsuddenly have this big smile,\" she said.\n\nJulie talked to the man's wife about these signs because she thinks it's\nimportant for families to know it might mean their loved one is going to pass\naway soon.\n\nShe said that these things usually happen a few weeks or a month before\nsomeone dies, so Julie wasn't shocked when the wife told her that her husband\nhad been staring in that special way many times a day for about a week.\n\nWhen his wife asked him what he was looking at, he said it was \"Jesus\",\nremembered Julie. She emphasized that the important bit was not that he saw\nJesus but that he looked happy.\n\n### Trending\n\nThe story then took an unexpected turn. The wife showed Julie some family\nalbums during her visit and shared that her sister had recently passed away.\n\nShe hadn't told her husband about it fearing it would upset him and he'd soon\nforget all about it anyway.\n\nEventually, overcome by guilt, she decided to tell him that his sister-in-law\nhad died. His peaceful reply was that he already knew because the sister had\nvisited him and told him so.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nPowered by\n\nBoy, 6, killed in house fire as he was found cuddling his brother, 3, to save\nhis life\n\nComments\n\nJustin Bieber's 'sad' selfie shows 'distress' as fans worry about rumored\nHailey split\n\nComments\n\nGrandma 'smiling again' after pig kidney transplant lets her avoid long human\nwaitlist\n\nComments\n\nTouching tributes pour in for New York chef who died at Nashville half-\nmarathon\n\nComments\n\nPrince William and Princess Kate share heartwarming picture to mark wedding\nanniversary\n\nComments\n\nTikTok star, 29, 'left a note before she was found hanging in her apartment'\n\nComments\n\n'My dad looked me dead in the eyes and told me he loves my mom more than me'\n\nComments\n\n'I want to outshine the bride at her wedding -
