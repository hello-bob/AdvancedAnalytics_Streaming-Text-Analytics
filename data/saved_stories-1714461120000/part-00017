The\noutbreak is likely to have begun when the virus jumped from an infected bird\ninto a cow, probably around late December or early January. This implies a\nprotracted, undetected spread of the virus \u2014 suggesting that more cattle\nacross the United States, and even in neighbouring regions, could have been\ninfected with avian influenza than currently reported.\n\nThese conclusions are based on swift and summary analyses by researchers,\nfollowing a dump of genomic data by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)\ninto a public repository earlier this week. But to scientists\u2019 dismay, the\npublicly released data do not include critical information that would shed\nlight on the outbreak\u2019s origins and evolution. Researchers also express\nconcern that the genomic data wasn\u2019t released until almost four weeks after\nthe outbreak was announced.\n\nSpeed is especially important for fast-spreading respiratory pathogens that\nhave the potential to spark pandemics, says Tulio de Oliveira, a\nbioinformatician at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. The cattle\noutbreak is not expected to allow the virus to gain the ability to spread\nbetween people, but researchers say it is important to be vigilant.\n\n\u201cIn an outbreak response, the faster you get data, the sooner you can act,\u201d\nsays Martha Nelson, a genomic epidemiologist at the National Center for\nBiotechnology Information (NCBI) in Bethesda, Maryland. Nelson adds that with\nevery week that goes by, the window for controlling the outbreak narrows.\n\u201cWhether we\u2019re not too late, to me, that\u2019s kind of the million dollar\nquestion.\u201d\n\n## Single spillover\n\nFederal officials announced on 25 March that a highly pathogenic bird-flu\nstrain had been detected in dairy cows. The USDA has since confirmed\ninfections with the strain, named H5N1, in 34 dairy herds in nine states. In\nlate March and early April, the USDA posted a handful of viral sequences from\ncows sampled in Texas and a sequence from a human case, on the widely used\nrepository GISAID.\n\nOn 21 April, the USDA posted more sequencing data on the Sequence Read Archive\n(SRA), a repository maintained by the NCBI. The latest upload included some 10\ngigabytes of sequencing information from 239 animals, includings cows,\nchickens and cats, says Karthik Gangavarapu, a computational biologist at\nScripps Research in La Jolla, who processed the raw data.\n\nHow countries are using genomics to help avoid a second coronavirus wave\n\nAnalysis of the genomes suggests that the cattle outbreak probably began with\na single introduction from wild birds in December or early January. \u201cIt\u2019s good\nnews that there\u2019s only been one jump that we can discern so far. But bad news,\nin many ways that it has been spreading for probably several months already,\u201d\nsays Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona\nin Tucson, who has analysed the genomes.\n\n\u201cThis virus is clearly transmitting among cows in some way,\u201d says Louise\nMoncla, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Pennsylvania in\nPhiladelphia, who has studied the genomic data.\n\nNelson, who is analysing the data, says she was most surprised by the extent\nof the genetic diversity in the virus infecting cattle, which indicates that\nthe virus has had months to evolve. Among the mutations are changes to a\nviral-protein section that scientists have linked to possible adaptation to\nspread in mammals, she says.\n\nThe data also show occasional jumps back from infected cows to birds and cats.\n\u201cThis is a multi-host outbreak,\u201d says Nelson.\n\nA single jump, many months ago, is \u201cthe most reliable conclusion you can\nmake,\u201d based on the available data, says Eric Bortz, a virologist at the\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage. But an important caveat is that it isn\u2019t clear\nwhat percentage of infected cows the samples represent, he says.\n\n## Fill in the blank\n\nThat\u2019s only one of many data gaps. Scientists lack information about each\nsample\u2019s precise collection date and the state where it was collected. Such\ngaps are \u201cvery abnormal,\u201d Nelson says.\n\nThe missing \u2018metadata\u2019 make it harder to answer many open questions, such as\nhow the virus is transmitted between cows and herds, and make it tricky to pin\ndown exactly when the virus jumped to cows. These insights could help to\ncontrol further viral spread, and protect workers on cattle farms \u201cwho can\nleast afford to be exposed,\u201d says Worobey.\n\nWorobey, Gangavarapu and their colleagues are now racing to analyse some\nmetadata uncovered through online sleuthing by Florence D\u00e9barre, an\nevolutionary biologist at the French national research agency CNRS in Paris.\nGangavarapu says dates and geographic information for 152 of the 239 samples\nhave been extracted from a USDA presentation posted on YouTube on 26 April.\n\nReal-time flu tracking\n\nResearchers also want more swabbing of cattle and wild birds to gain more\ninsights into the outbreak\u2019s exact origin and to decipher another puzzle. The\ngenomic data reveal that the viral genome sequenced from the infected person\ndoes not include some of the signature mutations observed in the cattle. \u201cThat\nis a mystery to everyone,\u201d says Nelson.\n\nOne possibility is that the person was infected by a separate viral lineage,\nwhich infected cattle that have not been swabbed. Another less likely\nscenario, which can\u2019t be ruled out, says Nelson, is that the person was\ninfected directly from a wild bird. \u201cIt raises just a whole slew of questions\nabout what black box of samples we are missing.\u201d\n\nShilo Weir, a public affairs specialist at the USDA, says the agency decided\nto post the unanalysed sequence data on the SRA to make it public as soon as\npossible. Weir says the agency will \u201cwork as quickly as possible\u201d to publish\ncurated files on GISAID with relevant epidemiological information, and will\ncontinue to make raw data available on the SRA on a rolling basis.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01256-5\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Bird flu in US cows: is the milk supply safe?\n\n  * Preventing disease transmission between people and wildlife\n\n  * Bird flu outbreak in US cows: why scientists are concerned\n\n  * Bird-flu threat disrupts Antarctic penguin studies\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Virology\n  * Genomics\n  * Public health\n\n## Latest on:\n\nBird flu in US cows: is the milk supply safe?\n\nNews Explainer 25 APR 24\n\nWHO redefines airborne transmission: what does that mean for future pandemics?\n\nNews 24 APR 24\n\nMonkeypox virus: dangerous strain gains ability to spread through sex, new\ndata suggest\n\nNews 23 APR 24\n\n85 million cells \u2014 and counting \u2014 at your fingertips\n\nTechnology Feature 29 APR 24\n\nEcologists: don\u2019t lose touch with the joy of fieldwork\n\nWorld View 24 APR 24\n\nEmx2 underlies the development and evolution of marsupial gliding membranes\n\nArticle 24 APR 24\n\nWHO redefines airborne transmission: what does that mean for future pandemics?\n\nNews 24 APR 24\n\nMore work is needed to take on the rural wastewater challenge\n\nCorrespondence 23 APR 24\n\nMonkeypox virus: dangerous strain gains ability to spread through sex, new\ndata suggest\n\nNews 23 APR 24\n\nBird flu in US cows: is the milk supply safe?\n\nNews Explainer 25 APR 24\n\nWHO redefines airborne transmission: what does that mean for future pandemics?\n\nNews 24 APR 24\n\nMonkeypox virus: dangerous strain gains ability to spread through sex, new\ndata suggest\n\nNews 23 APR 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### W2 Professorship with tenure track to W3 in Animal Husbandry (f/m/d)\n\nThe Faculty of Agricultural Sciences at the University of G\u00f6ttingen invites\napplications for a temporary professorship with civil servant status (g...\n\nG\u00f6ttingen (Stadt), Niedersachsen (DE)\n\nGeorg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen\n\n  * #### W1 professorship for \u201eTissue Aspects of Immunity and Inflammation\u201c\n\nKiel University (CAU) and the University of L\u00fcbeck (UzL) are striving to\nincrease the proportion of qualified female scientists in research and tea...\n\nL\u00fcbeck\n\nUniversity of Luebeck\n\n  * #### W1 professorship for \"Bioinformatics and artificial intelligence that preserve privacy\"\n\nKiel University (CAU) and the University of L\u00fcbeck (UzL) are striving to\nincrease the proportion of qualified female scientists in research and tea...\n\nKiel, Schleswig-Holstein (DE)\n\nUniversit\u00e4t Kiel - Medizinische Fakult\u00e4t\n\n  * #### W1 professorship for \"Central Metabolic Inflammation\u201c\n\nKiel University (CAU) and the University of L\u00fcbeck (UzL) are striving to\nincrease the proportion of qualified female scientists in research and tea...\n\nL\u00fcbeck\n\nUniversity of Luebeck\n\n  * #### W1 professorship for \"Congenital and adaptive lymphocyte regulation\"\n\nKiel University (CAU) and the University of L\u00fcbeck (UzL) are striving to\nincrease the proportion of qualified female scientists in research and tea...\n\nKiel, Schleswig-Holstein (DE)\n\nUniversit\u00e4t Kiel - Medizinische Fakult\u00e4t\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Bird flu in US cows: is the milk supply safe?\n\n  * Preventing disease transmission between people and wildlife\n\n  * Bird flu outbreak in US cows: why scientists are concerned\n\n  * Bird-flu threat disrupts Antarctic penguin studies\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Virology\n  * Genomics\n  * Public health\n\n## Sign up to Nature Briefing\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your\ninbox every weekday.\n\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter \u2014 what matters in science, free to\nyour inbox daily.\n\nGet the most important science stories of the day, free in your inbox.
