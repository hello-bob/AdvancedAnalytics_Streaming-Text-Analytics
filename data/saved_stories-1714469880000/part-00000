Photograph: Michael Sanchez\n\nBirds\n\n# Photographer accidentally snaps rare bird in Oregon: \u2018It\u2019s mind-blowing\u2019\n\nMichael Sanchez took photos of a bird at Hug Point that may be first official\nimages in North America of the rare blue rock-thrush\n\nMaanvi Singh\n\nShare\n\nMichael Sanchez was setting up his new camera to capture a waterfall at\nOregon\u2019s Hug Point at sunrise when he spotted a little bird hopping around. He\nsnapped a few photos, and didn\u2019t think much more of it.\n\nA week later, those snapshots have made him the star \u2013 and the envy \u2013 of the\nlocal birding community. Sanchez, who is from Vancouver, Washington, may have\ninadvertently captured the first images of an extremely rare blue rock-thrush\nin North America.\n\nHow birdwatching\u2019s biggest record threw its online community into chaos\n\nRead more\n\nThe species, which is native to east Asia, has only once before been spotted\nin this region, in 1997. But that sighting was rejected by the American\nBirding Association. If Sanchez\u2019s images are verified by local and national\nbirding groups, he could be credited as the first person to successfully\nrecord a blue rock-thrush in the region.\n\n\u201cI was very very surprised to see just how stirred up this got folks,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nSanchez, a middle school band director and musician who very recently took up\nphotography as a hobby, had never considered himself much of a birder. But as\nhe was reviewing his photos from his trip to the coast, it struck him that the\ncute bird he saw was unusual \u2013 he\u2019d never seen anything like it before. \u201cSo I\nthought, I\u2019ve got to post it on the socials, right?\u201d Not long after, a friend\nof a friend \u2013 an avid birder \u2013 reached out. From its unique blue and chestnut\nplumage, the bird looked distinctively like a male blue rock-thrush. It turned\nout, Sanchez may have set a birding record.\n\n\u201cA lot of times when something like this happens, there\u2019s a lot of effort\namong the birding community to try and verify it, because everyone wants to go\nand see it for themselves,\u201d said Brodie Cass Talbott, of the Bird Alliance of\nOregon and the Oregon Birding Association.\n\nVolunteer experts have been working with Sanchez to verify the image and\nconfirm its location. No other local birders have been able to spot the bird\nsince Sanchez photographed it \u2013 but oddly, there was another blue rock-thrush\nsighting four days later, at the Farallon Islands off the San Francisco coast.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether this was the same bird or another bird. As Sanchez\u2019s\nphotos made rounds in online birding groups, another person reported seeing\nwhat may have been the same blue rock-thrush in January, but was not able to\ntake a photo.\n\nIt is doubly uncertain how this bird even made it so far from its home, to\nNorth America. \u201cMaybe this bird individually just has faulty navigation,\u201d said\nCass Talbot. It may have gotten lost, and then trapped in a strong wind\nsystem. Or it may have hitched a ride on a ship.\n\nUsually, when ultra-rare, non-endemic bird species turn up on the west coast,\nthey tend to be seabirds, spotted far off shore. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why it\u2019s been\nsuch a big story here, and people have been so excited about it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sort of mind-bending.\u201d\n\nThe implausible sighting has been a reminder of how unexpected and fascinating\nbirding can be, Cass Talbot added. \u201cIt\u2019s always neat for us to see how big the\nworld is and how incredible these creatures are.\u201d\n\nSanchez agrees. He wasn\u2019t a birder before, but \u201cthis really has opened my\neyes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m a birder at this point,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI think I\u2019m in the club.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Birds\n  * Birdwatching\n  * Animals\n  * Wildlife\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
