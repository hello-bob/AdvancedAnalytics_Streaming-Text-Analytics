For starters, you can actually buy them. TensorWave has\nsecured a large allocation of the parts.\n\nBy the end of 2024, TensorWave aims to have 20,000 MI300X accelerators\ndeployed across two facilities, and plans to bring additional liquid-cooled\nsystems online next year.\n\nAMD's latest AI silicon is also faster than Nvidia's much coveted H100. \"Just\nin raw specs, the MI300x dominates H100,\" Tatarchuk said.\n\nLaunched at AMD\u2019s Advancing AI event in December, the MI300X is the chip\ndesign firm\u2019s most advanced accelerator to date. The 750W chip uses a\ncombination of advanced packaging to stitch together 12 chiplets \u2014 20 if you\ncount the HBM3 modules \u2014 into a single GPU that's claimed to be 32 percent\nfaster than Nvidia's H100.\n\nIn addition to higher floating point performance, the chip also boasts a\nlarger 192GB of HBM3 memory capable of delivering 5.3TB/s of bandwidth versus\nthe 80GB and 3.35TB/s claimed by the H100.\n\nAs we've seen from Nvidia's H200 \u2013 a version of the H100 boosted by the\ninclusion of HBM3e - memory bandwidth is a major contributor to AI\nperformance, particularly in inferencing on large language models.\n\nMuch like Nvidia's HGX and Intel's OAM designs, standard configurations of\nAMD's latest GPU require eight accelerators per node.\n\nThat\u2019s the configuration the folks at TensorWave are busy racking and\nstacking.\n\n\"We have hundreds going in now and thousands going in the months to come,\"\nTatarchuk said.\n\n### Racking them up\n\nIn a photo posted to social media, the TensorWave crew showed what appeared to\nbe three 8U Supermicro AS-8125GS-TNMR2 systems racked up. This led us to\nquestion whether TensorWave's racks were power or thermally limited after all,\nit's not unusual for these systems to pull in excess of 10kW when fully\nloaded.\n\nIt turns out that the folks at TensorWave hadn't finished installing the\nmachines and that the firm is targeting four nodes with a total capacity of\naround 40kW per rack. These systems will be cooled using rear door heat\nexchangers (RDHx). As we've discussed in the past, these are rack-sized\nradiators through which cool water flows. As hot air exits a conventional\nserver, it passes through the radiator which cools it to acceptable levels.\n\nThis cooling tech has become a hot commodity among datacenter operators\nlooking to support denser GPU clusters and led to some supply chain\nchallenges, TensorWave COO Piotr Tomasik said.\n\n\"There's a lot of capacity issues, even in the ancillary equipment around data\ncenters right now,\" he said, specifically referencing RDHx as a pain point.\n\"We've been successful thus far and we were very bullish on our ability to\ndeploy them.\"\n\nLonger term, however, TensorWave has its sights set on direct-to-chip cooling\nwhich can be hard to deploy in datacenters that weren\u2019t designed to house\nGPUs, Tomasik said. \"We're excited to deploy direct to chip cooling in the\nsecond half of the year. We think that that's going to be a lot better and\neasier with density.\"\n\n### Performance anxiety\n\nAnother challenge is confidence in AMD's performance. According to Tatarchuk,\nwhile there's a lot of enthusiasm around AMD offering an alternative to\nNvidia, customers are not certain they will enjoy the same performance.\n\"There's also a lot of 'We're not 100 percent sure if it's going to be as\ngreat as what we're currently used to on Nvidia',\u201d he said.\n\nIn the interest of getting systems up and running as quickly as possible,\nTensorWave will launch its MI300X nodes using RDMA over Converged Ethernet\n(RoCE). These bare metal systems will be available for fixed lease periods,\napparently for as little as $1/hr/GPU.\n\n### Scaling up\n\nOver time, the outfit aims to introduce a more cloud-like orchestration layer\nfor provisioning resources. Implementing GigaIO's PCIe 5.0-based FabreX\ntechnology to stitch together up to 5,750 GPUs in a single domain with more\nthan a petabyte of high bandwidth memory is also on the agenda.\n\nThese so-called TensorNODEs are based on GigaIO's SuperNODE architecture it\nshowed off last year, which used a pair of PCIe switch appliances to connect\nup to 32 AMD MI210 GPUs together. In theory, this should allow a single CPU\nhead node to address far more than the eight accelerators typically seen in\nGPU nodes today.\n\nThis approach differs from Nvidia\u2019s preferred design, which uses NVLink to\nstitch together multiple superchips into one big GPU. While NVLink is\nconsiderably faster topping out at 1.8TB/s of bandwidth in its latest\niteration compared to just 128GB/s on PCIe 5.0, it only supports\nconfigurations up to 576 GPUs.\n\n  * Irish power crunch could be prompting AWS to ration compute resources\n  * Lambda borrows half a billion bucks to grow its GPU cloud\n  * AMD slaps together a silicon sandwich with MI300-series APUs, GPUs to challenge Nvidia's AI empire\n  * Why Nvidia and AMD are roasting each other over AI performance claims\n\nTensorWave will fund its bit barn build by using its GPUs as collateral for a\nlarge round of debt financing, an approach used by other datacenter operators.\nJust last week, Lambda revealed it'd secured a $500 million loan to fund the\ndeployment of \"tens of thousands\" of Nvidia's fastest accelerators.\n\nMeanwhile, CoreWeave, one of the largest providers of GPUs for rent, was able\nto secure a massive $2.3 billion loan to expand its datacenter footprint.\n\n\"You would, you should expect us to have the same sort of announcement here\nlater this year,\" Tomasik said. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * AMD\n  * Datacenter\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * AMD\n  * Datacenter\n  * GPU\n  * Nvidia\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Apple M1\n  * Disaster recovery\n  * Epyc\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * GTC\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Omniverse\n  * Open Compute Project\n  * PUE\n  * Software defined data center\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Xilinx\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * Hardware\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n2 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * AMD\n  * Datacenter\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * AMD\n  * Datacenter\n  * GPU\n  * Nvidia\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Apple M1\n  * Disaster recovery\n  * Epyc\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * GTC\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Omniverse\n  * Open Compute Project\n  * PUE\n  * Software defined data center\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Xilinx\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * Hardware\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Intel Gaudi's third and final hurrah is an AI accelerator built to best\nNvidia's H100\n\nIntel Vision Goodbye dedicated AI hardware and hello to a GPU that fuses Xe\ngraphics DNA with Habana chemistry\n\nSystems7 days | 1\n\n#### AI bubble or not, Nvidia is betting everything on a GPU-accelerated\nfuture\n\nComment LLMs powering generative AI may be moving GPUs, but Huang and co\nalready looking at next big opportunity\n\nSystems22 days | 7\n\n#### Lambda borrows half a billion bucks to grow its GPU cloud\n\nWill buy tens of thousands of Nvidia's prized accelerators, which will be\ncollateral for the loan\n\nPaaS + IaaS11 days | 8\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Next-gen Meta AI chip serves up ads while sipping power\n\nFresh silicon won't curb Zuck's appetite for GPUs just yet\n\nOn-Prem6 days | 6\n\n#### Nvidia turns up the AI heat with 1,200W Blackwell GPUs\n\nFive times the performance of the H100, but you'll need liquid cooling to tame\nthe beast\n\nSystems29 days | 17\n\n#### Tiny Corp launches Nvidia-powered AI computer because 'it just works'\n\nStartup slams AMD for buggy firmware\n\nPersonal Tech22 days | 9\n\n#### Nvidia software exec Kari Briski on NIM, CUDA, and dogfooding AI\n\nInterview A RAGs to riches story\n\nAI + ML21 days |\n\n#### What Nvidia's Blackwell efficiency gains mean for DC operators\n\nAnalysis Air cooling's diminishing returns on full display with Nv's B-series\nsilicon\n\nSystems20 days | 4\n\n#### Stability AI reportedly ran out of cash to pay its bills for rented\ncloudy GPUs\n\nGenerative AI darling was on track to pay $99M on compute to generate just\n$11M in revenues\n\nAI + ML13 days | 22\n\n#### Google Cloud chief is really psyched about this AI thing\n\nCloud Next We're on a highway to ML\n\nPaaS + IaaS7 days | 6\n\n#### Intel CEO suggests AI can help to create a one-person Unicorn\n\nIntel Vision And possibly replace entire business units too\n\nAI + ML6 days | 36\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
