Today, we\u2019re happy to announce a plugin that provides\nthe Serial Port Monitor tool window. It allows you to communicate with serial\ndevices like Arduino right from CLion.\n\nThe plugin was originally released by Dmitry Cherkas, and then the CLion team\ntook over after coming to an agreement with the author. The plugin is open-\nsource under the Apache License \u2013 you can find the source code on our GitHub.\n\nDOWNLOAD CLION\n\n## Key benefits\n\nImagine you\u2019re working with several serial devices and want to connect to the\nCOM ports you\u2019re using for communicating with the devices. And let\u2019s say you\nneed to monitor the data transmitted in and out of a specific COM port. Now\nyou no longer need any additional utilities for that \u2013 simply install the\nplugin to CLion.\n\nCLion\u2019s serial port monitor is easy to configure and connect to the port in\njust one click. The flexible UI allows you to rearrange the tabs in a way that\nsuits your workflow. The port console supports many modes and encodings. Let\u2019s\ntake a closer look!\n\n### Simultaneous multiple connections\n\nThe plugin operates on the basis of pre-configured profiles. A profile\ncontains a saved record of the port name and all the necessary parameters,\nlike encoding, baud rate, stop bits, and others.\n\nThe plugin supports multiple profiles, so you can configure all available\nports and simultaneously monitor all the ports you need to. This is handy when\nyour project includes multiple devices that communicate with each other:\nwireless systems, IoT networks, mesh networks of different types, etc. It\u2019s\npossible to have several profiles for the same port with different parameters\nfor different projects.\n\nGIF\n\nAs you can see, you can drag each tab by its title to rearrange the tabs\ninside the tool window and, thus make several consoles visible simultaneously.\n\n### Output console\n\nIn the connection output console, you can adjust parameters on the fly, type\nin data, clean the text window, pause, or disconnect the port. The console\nsupports:\n\n  * Multibyte encodings, including UTF-8\n  * Correct handling of CR/LF line breaks\n  * Local echoing\n  * ANSI coloring\n\nThe console output tab is configurable and allows you to enable HEX along with\nthe ASCII view, scroll to the end of the output, and pause and clean the data\nlog.\n\nGIF\n\n## How to enable Serial Port Monitor and start viewing the data\n\nInstall the plugin into CLion in Settings/Preferences | Plugins. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll get a new tool window in View | Tool Windows | Serial Connections:\n\nIn the tool window, you\u2019ll find the list of saved connection profiles and the\nlist of currently available ports (connected devices). Selecting a profile\nshows its saved parameters, and selecting a port shows the default settings,\nwhich can also be adjusted.\n\nTo create a profile, select an available port and click Create profile....\n\nGIF\n\nYou can also clone existing profiles. Profiles\u2019 port names can either be\nselected from the list of ports or entered manually. The latter is helpful\nwhen working with Linux symlinks, for instance. Select an available port or a\nprofile to configure the settings and click Connect to start monitoring the\ntransferred data.\n\nembedded plugin\n\n  * Share\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n\nPrev post CLion 2024.1 Is Available!
