Trump could face jail\ntime, although a fine or probation is more likely, analysts say.\n\nBut the trial in a dingy courtroom under massive media scrutiny will keep\nTrump off the campaign trail for four days a week over a possibly six-to-\neight-week period, while Biden hammers him from the White House and around the\ncountry.\n\nMonday is expected to see opening statements -- a chance for each camp to lay\nout their case to jurors and mount preemptive attacks on the opposing side's\nwitnesses.\n\n\"This is going to be the beginning of probably the most sensational trial in\nAmerican history,\" former prosecutor Bennett Gershman, now a lecturer at Pace\nUniversity, told AFP.\n\n\"The stakes are almost infinite in terms of what the consequences could be....\nEvery day we're going to be hearing testimony that's going to be damaging to\nMr Trump.\"\n\nTrump has railed against the case, particularly what he calls the \"very\nunfair\" partial gag order imposed by the judge to prevent him from using his\npowerful media presence to attack witnesses, prosecutors and relatives of\ncourt staff.\n\nA hearing will be held Tuesday at which the Judge Juan Merchan will decide if\nTrump is already in contempt of court due to his outbursts during the jury\nselection process.\n\n\"We are still considering our options... as far as what sanctions we will be\nasking for,\" prosecutor Josh Steinglass said Thursday, raising the prospect\nthey will seek Trump's imprisonment.\n\nMerchan chastised Trump for apparently muttering and gesturing within earshot\nof prospective jurors last week.\n\n\"I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom,\" he said.\n\nCourt hearings have already disrupted Trump's campaigning plans, forcing him\nto sit silently in the chilly Manhattan courthouse for hours. However, he has\nused the heavy media attention to amplify his claims of a \"witch hunt\" in\nimpromptu statements outside the courtroom.\n\nHe had planned to resume some semblance of normal campaigning with a rally in\nNorth Carolina Saturday, but bad weather forced the outdoor gathering to be\ncalled off.\n\n\"It's a pretty big storm. So if you don't mind, I think we're going to have to\njust do a rain check. I'm so sad,\" Trump told attendees while en route, in a\ncall broadcast to the crowd.\n\nThe Republican's other three criminal cases have been repeatedly delayed due\nto Trump's successful strategy of challenging every step.\n\nHowever, Merchan has run the New York fraud trial on a tight schedule.\n\nA huge pool of potential jurors was grilled last week by prosecutors and\ndefense attorneys about their media habits, political donations, education and\nwhether they have attended a pro- or anti-Trump rally.\n\nMerchan has ruled the jurors must remain anonymous for their own security,\nalthough so many personal details emerged during the selection process that\nthe measure was quickly weakened. The judge later asked reporters to stop\nproviding physical descriptions of jurors and not to identify where they work\n.\n\nA unanimous verdict will be required to convict Trump, who has been ordered by\nthe judge to attend each day of the trial.\n\nMerchan chastised Trump for apparently muttering and gesturing within earshot\nof prospective jurors last week AFPMerchan chastised Trump for apparently\nmuttering and gesturing within earshot of prospective jurors last week AFP\n\n\u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024.
