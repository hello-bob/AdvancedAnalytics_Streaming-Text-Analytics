Before I went\nout I stopped in at the Dive Provo shop to chat with the resident expert and\nto buy a pair of fins (I had purchased a mask and snorkel from him the prior\nyear). We started talking about the reef-safe sunscreen and the general state\nof the reefs (which are shit). I had visited a new resort on the South Side of\nthe island that was geared towards windsurfers and other water sports and told\nhim I was surprised they sold \u201cun\u201dreef-safe sunscreen. (The people at the\nhotel told me they were aware of them being unsafe, but tourists wanted\nsunscreens that didn\u2019t leave a white mineral film on their skin. Boo hoo.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are shit.\u201d\n\nI laughed and kind of agreed with him, because I had been observing tourists\nengaging in some shitty behavior while I was there \u2014 more out of ignorance\nthan malice, mind you.\n\nThis photo is courtesy of Big Blue Collective, which is an amazing eco-water\nexploration company in Turks and Caicos (TCI).\n\nI was on a boat in the open ocean and saw a whale breach. I knew I had to jump\nin to speak with them but I was very frightened. I jumped anyway.\n\nA baby whale greeted me and allowed me to merge into it. From its eyes, the\nworld looked monotone blue and grey, with flickers of light.\n\n\u201cTime is different for us. Yes, we have days and nights. But we live mostly in\nseasons. Warm season. Cold season. Breeding season. Feeding season. Singing\nseason.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are shit. But shit makes the world go round.\u201d They said this with\ngentle seriousness.\n\nI saw how whale poop feeds other creatures. And parrot fish eat coral and\ntheir poop creates sand. And all the humans trying to hide their poop and be\nashamed about it was wasteful and unfortunate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see or know humans often. Sometimes they are nice. Sometimes they\nare horrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour world is invisible to us, like another planet, except what we see from\ndown here.\u201d (I saw lower bodies swimming on the beach, trawlers dredging up\nand destroying the ocean floor, floating and sunken trash, scuba divers and\nexplorers in robotic machines.) \u201cWe need people to understand how to respect\nus. How to help us. The ocean will always survive, but it\u2019s getting hotter and\nhotter here.\u201d\n\nAt that point, I got so hot myself and started to cry.\n\n\u201cPlease, tell our story.\u201d\n\nAn octopus came and took my hand to take me somewhere, but the drum started\ncalling me back. I surfaced and the people in the boat cheered. Then they held\nup an octopus that they had harvested in celebration. But the octopus was\nlooking me in the eye as if to say \u201cSee? See what we mean?\u201d\n\n********\n\nFor the record, I think octopus is delicious. But I no longer eat it. Not\nbecause I think we should never eat octopus or seafood, but because this is a\ntime when we are being asked by the ocean to scale back our behaviors that\ncause the oceans to overheat. Those behaviors include overeating seafood and\noverfishing, wearing sunscreens that are toxic to the ocean life, mining the\noceans of oil and minerals, and acting like the ocean is a playground where\nour behavior has no consequences.\n\nBut it\u2019s also about changing our behavior on land. Besides the obvious\nreduction of burning fossil fuels and eating as if nothing mattered,\noverdevelopment is a main source of ocean destruction (and flooding, by the\nway). In Woods Hole, Cape Cod, Massachusetts where my daughter works and\nlives, they now have \u201cyellow tides.\u201d These toxic tides are the result of so\nmuch development that septic systems are overflowing into the water, making\nthe oysters and fish unsafe to eat \u2014 not just because it\u2019s urine, which is\nnitrogen, but because what\u2019s in our urine \u2014 toxic drugs, cleaning supplies\nflushed down the toilets and hormone-disrupting chemicals that are messing\nwith the health and sexuality of ocean life (not to mention ours). Think about\nthat next time you order raw oysters.\n\nPeople are shit. But shit makes the world go round IF we learn to channel our\nshit in the right ecological directions. From baby diapers to a lifetime of\nsitting on the toilet, to how we dispose of our dead bodies, it all matters.\nWhale poop feeds phytoplankton, which makes more than half the oxygen on earth\nand feeds all the tiny fish. Think about that for a second...saving and\nprotecting the whales isn\u2019t just a feel-good, do-good distant action. It\u2019s\nabout making sure we have enough air to breathe! It\u2019s about making sure there\nare enough small fish to feed the bigger fish. It\u2019s about ensuring an adequate\nclean supply of seafood for you to enjoy when you go out to eat or cook at\nhome.\n\nAs one of the local guides (a \u201cbelonger\u201d) from Big Blue Collective told me\nwhen I asked him if people in TCI have gardens, \u201cThe ocean is our garden!\u201d We\nmust tend to the ocean just as carefully as we tend to our backyard gardens \u2014\norganically, regeneratively, and with future generations in mind.\n\nAs beach season starts this year, the Whales want you to think about all these\nthings. Here are a few tips to help you get started:\n\n  1. Stop using sunscreen unless you have to. The only reef-safe sunscreens are purely mineral-based. Better yet, manage your sun exposure by only going out at certain times of the day and keeping your body and the water around you free from toxins. Wear rash guards and hats instead. Sunscreen is one less thing you need to buy.\n  2. Reduce your consumption of seafood. Raw oysters should only be eaten in cold months (R months). Avoid the larger fish that accumulate toxins from eating smaller fish. Eat local and wild. Yes, salmon is good for you. But farm-raised salmon is terrible for the environment, which means it\u2019s terrible for you, too.\n  3. Renovate and rehabilitate rather than build new construction. Much of the flooding attributed to climate change is also due to the overdevelopment of our water-absorbing land. Overdevelopment forces water to run off into the waterways, taking all the toxins with it into the ocean. According to the Reef Rescue group in TCI, it\u2019s not just ocean heating that\u2019s killing the coral, but a virus most likely dredged up from construction happening in Florida.\n  4. Keep your recreation clean. That means sailboats instead of yachts. Stand-up paddle boards instead of jet skis. And Kayaks instead of motorboats. Kite surfing is good too. Keeping your recreation clean is not just better for the water, it\u2019s better for your body. For inspiration, check out Cole Brauer, the first American woman to sail all around the world by herself in a race where she came in second!\n  5. Keep your pee and poo clean. Eat organic food. Avoid toxic cleaners and beauty products. Try not to use pharmaceuticals you don\u2019t need. Don\u2019t flush stuff down the toilet or sewer drains that is toxic.\n\nThis is me after a successful solo snorkeling swim. I have a bit of reef-safe\nsunscreen on, hence the white residue. I am also sprinkled with a bit of\nParrot Fish poo, otherwise known as sand. I saw them down there chomping away!\nWhat the Whales want us to know is that we can still have lots of fun in the\nwater and enjoy the beach, but they\u2019d prefer if we learn to do it without\nharming them and their home, so they can continue to provide us with air to\nbreath and songs to sing together.\n\nMaria Rodale is an explorer of nature and an award-winning activist in its\nbehalf.
