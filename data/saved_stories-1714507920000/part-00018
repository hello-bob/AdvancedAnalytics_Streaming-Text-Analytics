Prior to joining The Verge, she\ncovered the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy.\n\nApr 29, 2024, 8:08 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nIllustration: The Verge\n\nOpenAI announced the Memory feature that allows ChatGPT to store queries,\nprompts, and other customizations more permanently in February. At the time,\nit was only available to a \u201csmall portion\u201d of users, but now it\u2019s available\nfor ChatGPT Plus paying subscribers outside of Europe or Korea.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s Memory works in two ways to make the chatbot\u2019s responses more\npersonalized. The first is by letting you tell ChatGPT to remember certain\ndetails, and the second is by learning from conversations similar to other\nalgorithms in our apps. Memory brings ChatGPT closer to being a better AI\nassistant. Once it remembers your preferences, it can include them without\nneeding a reminder.\n\nAs The Verge\u2019s David Pierce pointed out, some users can find it creepy if\nchatbots know them in this way, so OpenAI has said users will always have\ncontrol over what ChatGPT retains (and what is used for additional training).\n\nOpenAI writes in a blog post that in a change from the earlier test, now\nChatGPT will tell users when memories are updated. Users can manage what\nChatGPT remembers by reviewing what the chatbot took from conversations and\neven making ChatGPT \u201cforget\u201d unwanted details.\n\nImage: OpenAI\n\nOpenAI\u2019s examples of uses for Memory include:\n\n> You\u2019ve explained that you prefer meeting notes to have headlines, bullets\n> and action items summarized at the bottom. ChatGPT remembers this and recaps\n> meetings this way.\n>\n> You\u2019ve told ChatGPT you own a neighborhood coffee shop. When brainstorming\n> messaging for a social post celebrating a new location, ChatGPT knows where\n> to start.\n>\n> You mention that you have a toddler and that she loves jellyfish. When you\n> ask ChatGPT to help create her birthday card, it suggests a jellyfish\n> wearing a party hat.\n>\n> As a kindergarten teacher with 25 students, you prefer 50-minute lessons\n> with follow-up activities. ChatGPT remembers this when helping you create\n> lesson plans.\n\nChatGPT could always recall details during active conversations; for example,\nif you ask the chatbot to draft an email, you can immediately follow it up\nwith \u201cmake it more professional,\u201d and it will remember that you were talking\nabout email. But if you wait long enough or start a new conversation, that all\ngoes out the window.\n\nOpenAI did not say why Memory will not be available in Europe or Korea. The\ncompany says Memory will roll out to subscribers to ChatGPT Enterprise and\nTeams, as well as custom GPTs on the GPT Store, but did not specify when.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Razer made a million dollars selling a mask with RGB, and the FTC is not pleased\n\n  2. ## FCC fines AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing location data\n\n  3. ## The walls of Apple\u2019s garden are tumbling down\n\n  4. ## In the first Autonomous Racing League race, the struggle was real\n\n  5. ## Fiido Air review: so lightweight you\u2019ll forget it\u2019s an e-bike\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from this stream From ChatGPT to Gemini: how AI is rewriting the\ninternet\n\n  * ### The OLED iPad Pro could launch with an M4 chip\n\nApr 28, 2024, 1:31 PM UTC\n\n  * ### What will Instagram\u2019s chatbot creator look like?\n\nApr 27, 2024, 7:34 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Zuckerberg says it will take Meta years to make money from generative AI\n\nApr 24, 2024, 11:40 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Microsoft launches Phi-3, its smallest AI model yet\n\nApr 23, 2024, 7:19 AM UTC\n\nSee all 503 stories\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
