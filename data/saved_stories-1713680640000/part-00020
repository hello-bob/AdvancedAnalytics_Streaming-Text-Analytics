This spam\nwas disruptive to said projects, whose (usually volunteer) maintainers had to\nfigure out what was going on and then try to stop the spammy PRs.\n\nMax Howell, the creator of tea.xyz (and creator of homebrew, though he's no\nlonger involved), seemed apologetic, and promised to make changes to the\nprotocol to stop this spammy behavior.\n\nNow, deprived of that avenue, people are just creating massive waves of empty\nsoftware packages, with nothing other than a \"teafile\" with their crypto\nwallet address for rewards, and submitting them to package managers like NPM\nand RubyGems.\n\nThis spam prompted a blog post from RubyGems, who wrote that they had to\ndevote time to strengthening limits on package publishing and \"ensuring\n[accounts] didn't disrupt the community further.\"\n\nSecurity researchers at Phylum also wrote up the protocol's impact on the\nJavaScript world, which has seen as many as 7x as many packages published on\nNPM as previous daily averages. \"Automated sustained spamming of this volume\nfor months on end is rare and does nothing but cause heavy strain on the\necosystem itself, degrading the performance of the ecosystem for genuine users\nand straining open source security researchers,\" they wrote.\n\n  * \"The Implications of Crypto Rewards on RubyGems.org\", RubyGems [archive]\n  * \"Digital Detritus: Unintended Consequences of Open Source Sustainability Platforms\", Phylum [archive]\n\nOther entries related to\n\nTheme tags: Bad idea\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n## $26 million liquidated in surprise Pac Finance smart contract change\n\n(attribution)\n\nPac Finance, a of the Aave lending protocol deployed on the Blast blockchain,\nsurprised some of its users as an unannounced and unexpected code change\nlowered the liquidation threshold.

They also\nacknowledged that there had been \"abnormal, unscheduled upgrades to the\nprotocol\". They asked their community members for help in tracking the wallet.\n\nSome speculated that the story was fake, and that the project had stolen the\nfunds. However, Chinese police have in several instances cracked down on\npeople and companies involved in Filecoin-related projects, including an $83.3\nmillion alleged pyramid scheme in August 2023 and a group of Filecoin Ponzi\nschemers in 2021.

Although there was novelty value in the themed\nrestaurant, which for a time boasted that it accepted cryptocurrency payments,\nthe excitement seemed to wear off quickly after a few early news articles.\nAfter a while, the restaurant's crypto payments became spotty, with employees\nsaying the system was unwieldy and unpopular among customers.\n\nSome more recent Yelp reviews described fairly mediocre food, which \"[t]he\nNFTs don't make up for\".\n\nThe restaurant opened in April 2022, a month after owner Andy Nguyen purchased\nBored Ape #6184 for $268,000, along with three Mutant Apes for an additional\ncombined $187,000. #6184 became the restaurant's logo, and the others were\nincorporated into the restaurant's branding. The NFTs haven't been resold\nsince, although it's unlikely they could recoup close to their original\npurchase prices \u2014 Bored Apes have been averaging a little under $50,000 in\nrecent sales, and Mutants around $8,500 each.\n\n  * Tweet by Long Beach County [archive]\n  * Recent Bored Ape sale prices [archive]\n  * Recent Mutant Ape sale prices [archive]\n\nOther entries related to or\n\nTheme tags: Collapse\n\nBlockchain tags: Blockchain: Ethereum\n\nTech tags: NFT\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n## Do Kwon and Terraform Labs found liable for $40 billion fraud\n\nDo Kwon (attribution)\n\nAfter hearing arguments that Terraform Labs was \"built on lies\" during a two-\nweek-long trial, the jury in the civil case against the company and its\nfounder Do Kwon found that both were liable for fraud.\n\nKwon and his company were behind the algorithmic stablecoin, Terra, which\ndramatically collapsed in May 2022, sending huge ripple effects throughout the\necosystem. He and his company had lied about the stability of the token,\nultimately causing massive financial damage to the tune of around $40 billion.\n\nKwon is in custody in Montenegro after attempting to flee criminal cases in\nboth the United States and South Korea.
