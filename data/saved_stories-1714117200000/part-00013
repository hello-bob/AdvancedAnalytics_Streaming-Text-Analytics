Source: Getty.\n\nApril 25, 2024, 9:31 AM ET\n\nIn the pandemic winter of 2020, Katie, my family\u2019s 14-year-old miniature\npoodle, began coughing uncontrollably. After multiple vet visits, and more\nthan $1,000 in bills, a veterinary cardiologist diagnosed her with heart\nfailure. Our girl, a dog I loved so much that I wrote an essay about how I\ncalled her my \u201cdaughter,\u201d would likely die within nine months.\n\nKatie survived for almost two years. My younger son joked that Katie wasn\u2019t\ngoing to let advanced heart failure get in the way of her life goal of never\nleaving my side, but the truth was that I was the one who wouldn\u2019t let her go.\nKatie\u2019s extended life didn\u2019t come cheap. There were repeated scans,\nechocardiograms, and blood work, and several trips to veterinary emergency\nrooms. One drug alone cost $300 a month, and that was after I shopped\naggressively for discounts online.\n\nPeople like me have fueled the growth of what you might call Big Vet. As\nhousehold pets have risen in status\u2014from mere animals to bona fide family\nmembers\u2014so, too, has owners\u2019 willingness to spend money to ensure their well-\nbeing. Big-money investors have noticed. According to data provided to me by\nPitchBook, private equity poured $51.6 billion into the veterinary sector from\n2017 to 2023, and another $9.3 billion in the first four months of this year,\nseemingly convinced that it had discovered a foolproof investment. Industry\ncheerleaders pointed to surveys showing that people would go into debt to keep\ntheir four-legged friends healthy. The field was viewed as \u201clow-risk, high-\nreward,\u201d as a 2022 report issued by Capstone Partners put it, singling out the\nindustry for its higher-than-average rate of return on investment.\n\nFrom the December 2022 issue: How much would you pay to save your pet\u2019s life?\n\nIn the United States, corporations and private-equity funds have been rolling\nup smaller chains and previously independent practices. Mars Inc., of Skittles\nand Snickers fame, is, oddly, the largest owner of stand-alone veterinary\nclinics in the United States, operating more than 2,000 practices under the\nnames Banfield, VCA, and BluePearl. JAB Holding Company, the owner of National\nVeterinary Associates\u2019 1,000-plus hospitals (not to mention Panera and\nEspresso House), also holds multiple pet-insurance lines in its portfolio.\nShore Capital Partners, which owns several human health-care companies,\ncontrols Mission Veterinary Partners and Southern Veterinary Partners.\n\nAs a result, your local vet may well be directed by a multinational shop that\nviews caring for your fur baby as a healthy component of a diversified revenue\nstream. Veterinary-industry insiders now estimate that 25 to 30 percent of\npractices in the United States are under large corporate umbrellas, up from 8\npercent a little more than a decade ago. For specialty clinics, the number is\ncloser to three out of four.\n\nAnd as this happened, veterinary prices began to rise\u2014a lot. Americans spent\nan estimated $38 billion on health care and related services for companion\nanimals in 2023, up from about $29 billion in 2019. Even as overall inflation\ngot back under control last year, the cost of veterinary care did not. In\nMarch 2024, the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers was up 3.5 percent\nyear over year. The veterinary-services category was up 9.6 percent. If you\nhave ever wondered why keeping your pet healthy has gotten so out-of-control\nexpensive, Big Vet just might be your answer.\n\nTo get a sense of what might happen when the profit-seeking dial gets turned\nup too high in veterinary medicine, we need look no further than human health\ncare. An extensive body of research shows that when private equity takes over\na hospital or physician practice, prices and the number of expensive\nprocedures tend to go up. A study found serious medical errors occur more\nfrequently after private equity buys the hospital. Another study found that\ncosts to patients rise, too, sometimes substantially. And that\u2019s in a tougher\nregulatory environment. In veterinary medicine, there is no giant entity like\nMedicare capable of pushing back on prices. There is no requirement, in fact,\nto provide care at all, no matter how dire the animal\u2019s condition. Payment is\ndue at the time of service or there is no service.\n\nWhenever I told people I was working on this article, I was inundated with Big\nVet complaints. Catherine Liu, a professor at UC Irvine, took her elderly pit-\nbull mix, Buster, to a local VCA when he became lethargic and began drooling\nexcessively. More than $8,000 in charges later, there was still no diagnosis.\n\u201cSonograms, endoscopy\u2014what about just a hypothesis of what the symptoms could\nbe? Nothing like that at all was forthcoming,\u201d Liu told me. Shortly before\nBuster died, a vet in private practice diagnosed him with cancer. The disease,\nLiu said, had not once been mentioned by the vets at VCA. (Mars Petcare, VCA\u2019s\nparent company, declined to comment on the episode.)\n\nI don\u2019t mean to single out VCA here\u2014in fact, I should note that a VCA vet\u2019s\nmedical protocol was almost certainly responsible for my dog\u2019s longer-than-\nexpected life. One reason Mars-owned chains attract outsized attention for\ntheir high costs and customer-service failures is that the company actually\nbrands its acquisitions. That\u2019s unusual. A study conducted by the Arizona\nconsumer advocate Todd Nemet found that fewer than 15 percent of corporate-\nowned practices in the state slap their own brand identity on their vets; most\nkeep the original practice name, leaving customers with the illusion of local\nownership. (When I asked Thrive Pet Healthcare, a chain majority-owned by TSG\nConsumer Partners, about why the company doesn\u2019t brand its clinics, a\nspokesperson replied, \u201cWe realize the value of local hospital brands and are\ncommitted to preserving and supporting them.\u201d)\n\nIndeed, some pet owners told me that they realized that ownership of their vet\nhad changed only after what they thought was a routine visit resulted in\nrecommendations for mounds of tests, which turned out to have shot up in\nprice. Paul Cerro, the CEO of Cedar Grove Capital, which invests in the pet\nindustry, says this issue is frequent in online reviews. \u201cPeople will say,\n\u2018I\u2019ve been coming here for four years, and all of a sudden I\u2019m getting charged\nfor things I\u2019ve never been charged for,\u2019 and they give it one star.\u201d\n\nRead: The great veterinary shortage\n\nBig Vet denies charging excessive prices. VCA Canada, for instance, recently\ntold The Globe and Mail that prices can increase after an acquisition because\n\u201cthe quality of the care, the quality of everything we offer to them, goes up\nas well.\u201d A spokesperson for Mars told me, \u201cWe invest heavily in our\nassociates, hospitals, state-of-the-art equipment, technology, and other\nresources.\u201d NVA, which is planning an initial public offering in 2025 or 2026,\ndid not directly answer a question about why veterinary prices were rising so\nrapidly, instead sending me a statement saying, in part, \u201cOur vision is to\nbuild a community of hospitals that pet owners trust, are easy to access, and\nprovide the best possible value for care.\u201d\n\nDo rising prices really just reflect higher-quality care? There may be some\ntruth to this, but there is also evidence to the contrary. A study published\nlast year in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, for\nexample, found that vets working for large corporations reported more pressure\nto generate revenue, whereas veterinarians working for independent practices\nreported higher levels of satisfaction for such things as the \u201cability to\nacquire new large equipment\u201d and the \u201cability to get new/different drugs.\u201d\nPreliminary research by Emma Harris, the vice president of Vetster, a\nveterinary telehealth start-up, found significant differences in pricing\nbetween corporate and privately owned veterinary clinics in the same\ngeographic region. Usually, she told me, the increases \u201coccurred immediately\nafter the sale to a private-equity-owned group.\u201d\n\nAll of this doesn\u2019t sit well with many in the sector. Vets tend to be\nidealistic, which makes sense given that many of them rack up six figures in\nstudent-loan debt to pursue a profession that pays significantly less than\nhuman medicine. One vet, who worked for an emergency-services practice that,\nthey said, raised prices by 20 percent in 2022, told me, \u201cI almost got to the\npoint where I was ashamed to tell people what the estimate was for things\nbecause it was so insanely high.\u201d (The vet asked for anonymity because they\nfeared legal repercussions.) Others described mounting pressure to upsell\ncustomers following acquisition by private equity. \u201cYou don\u2019t always need to\ntake X-rays on an animal that\u2019s vomited just one time,\u201d Kathy Lewis, a\nveterinarian who formerly worked at a Tennessee practice purchased in 2021 by\nMission Veterinary Partners, told me. \u201cBut there was more of that going on.\u201d\nPrices increased rapidly as well, she said, leading to customer complaints.\n(Mission Veterinary Partners did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nThe combination of wheeling-and-dealing and price increases in the veterinary\nsector is beginning to attract the government\u2019s attention. In the United\nStates, the Federal Trade Commission required, in a 2022 consent decree, that\nJAB seek prior approval before purchasing any emergency or specialty clinic\nwithin 25 miles of one it already owns in California and Texas for the next\ndecade. In her written comments, FTC Chair Lina Khan said she feared these\none-by-one purchases could lead to the development of a stealth monopoly. (JAB\ndenied any wrongdoing.) And in the United Kingdom, where corporate ownership\nis higher than in the United States (even the practice originally owned by the\nauthor of the classic veterinary novel All Creatures Great and Small has been\nrolled up), government authorities are moving forward with an investigation\ninto high prices and market concentration after an initial inquiry drew what\nregulators called an \u201cunprecedented\u201d response from the public.\n\nPet owners used to have an easier time accepting the short lives of domestic\nanimals. Few people were taking the barnyard cat or junkyard dog in for\nchemotherapy or ACL surgery, to say nothing of post-op aquatic physical\ntherapy. \u201cWhen we started out over 20 years ago, you had to live near a\nveterinary teaching hospital to have access to something like an MRI,\u201d Karen\nLeslie, the executive director of the Pet Fund, a charity that aids people\nwith vet bills, told me. \u201cNow it\u2019s the standard of care. It\u2019s available\nbasically everywhere\u2014but that starts at $2,000.\u201d\n\nBig Vet, in Leslie\u2019s view, helped fuel an increase in expensive services. The\nsame medical progress that\u2019s helped humans beat back once-fatal diseases is\ndoing the same for cats and dogs, extending their life spans to record\nlengths. But only if you have the money to pay for it. Some pets\u2014my late\nKatie, Liu\u2019s late Buster\u2014receive one expensive test or treatment after\nanother, sometimes helpful, sometimes not. Other equally loved pets may go\nwithout basic care altogether, or even fall victim to what the industry calls\n\u201ceconomic euthanasia,\u201d where they are put down because their owners can\u2019t\nafford their medical bills. (Pet insurance, widely promoted by the industry,\nis unlikely to help much. Uptake rates are in the low single digits, a result\nof relatively high costs and often-limited benefits.)\n\nWatch: Volunteer veterinarians in Ukraine\n\nThe American Veterinary Medical Association\u2019s tracker shows that vet visits\nand purchases of heartworm and flea-and-tick medications are down compared\nwith this month last year, even as practice revenues are up, suggesting that\nsome owners are having trouble affording routine, preventative care. The\nmarket researcher Packaged Facts found that a full third of pet owners say\nthat they would take their animal to the vet more often if it were less\nexpensive. Shelter Animals Count, an animal-advocacy group, reports that the\nnumber of pets surrendered to shelters rose in the past two years. Carol\nMithers, the author of the upcoming book Rethinking Rescue, told me that some\npeople give up pets because they believe the shelter system will provide them\nwith necessary medical treatment\u2014something that is, heartbreakingly, not true.\n\nThe veterinary past is easy to romanticize. The truth is that pets have never\nreceived all the needed care, and that wealthy pet owners have always had\naccess to more care. But the emergence of Big Vet and the injection of\ncutthroat incentives into a traditionally idealistic, local industry threatens\nto make these problems far worse. It portends a future in which some pet\nowners get shaken down, their love for their pets exploited financially, while\nothers must forego even basic care for their pets. I don\u2019t think Katie, who\nloved all animals, would approve. I certainly don\u2019t.\n\nSupport for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett\nFoundation.\n\nHelaine Olen is a writer living in New York.
