AI) Have No Creativity\n\n## My Frustrating Quest for Usable AI-Generated Content\n\nContrary to the misconception that \"the misconception that AI lacks creativity\nis false,\" AI indeed lacks creativity.\n\nHere, when I say AI, I'm referring to LLMs like ChatGPT. I'm not trying to\ndiscuss abstract concepts like \"true creativity.\" It doesn't matter if there's\na parrot or a person inside the LLM. The point is that they haven't produced\nany practical, creative results in the real world. I'm only concerned with the\n\"practical\" sense of \"lacking creativity.\"\n\nI don't have any theoretical basis for my claim. However, this makes my\nargument strong because I'm not proposing a hypothesis. The basis for my claim\nis simply my observations from reality.\n\nLLMs seem to be good at certain creative tasks. When people say this, they\nprobably mean that LLMs are good at things like \"creating a Shakespearean-\nstyle rap using McDonald's menu items.\" They're also good at other creative\ntasks, such as:\n\n1\\. Finding commonalities between a chair and the sun.\n\n2\\. Coming up with unique settings for a novel, like a scenario where a\ndinosaur from the past becomes the President of the United States. Out of all\nthe novel settings I've prompted ChatGPT to generate, the most entertaining\none was where people became addicted to counting the number of pigeons, but it\nturned out they were actually counting the number of times they blinked.\n\nI don't know if these tasks are truly creative. I'm not going to define what\n\"creativity\" means here. When I say LLMs lack creativity, I simply mean that\nthey can't be used practically for tasks that I consider creative. Also, I'm\nnot saying AI can't generate new content. It's just that the content is\nterrible.\n\nI've tried many times to get creative results from LLMs because it would be\nawesome if it were possible. However, I've never gotten a single usable\nresult. Not once. They were all terrible.\n\nWhen the term \"truly new\" comes up, people often say, \"Creating something\ntruly new is done by only a tiny fraction of people.\" But the bar for \"truly\nnew\" in the sense that LLMs can't do it is incredibly low.\n\nBased on my experience, I don't think LLMs could come up with the core content\nof any of my blog posts unless I roleplay as Socrates and forcefully guide\nthem in that direction. The same goes for my various coding-related ideas.\n\nSo, am I a genius? If so, I'd appreciate some sponsorship.\n\nThe post is over.
