It is recommended to read\nThe Sourdough Framework first as it is the basis for the recipes in this book.\n\n## \ud83c\udf5e Baking the book (Docker)\n\n    \n    \n    make\n\nThen you can check out the file book/book.pdf\n\nIf you want to \ud83c\udf5e bake all the versions including ebook variants (.pdf, .epub),\nrun:\n\n    \n    \n    make bake\n\nYou can check the files in the folder book/release/\n\nYou can get some help on building various versions with:\n\n    \n    \n    cd book/ make help\n\n## Download\n\n  * Download .pdf\n  * Download .epub\n\n## Support\n\nDid you find a typo, or feel the wording could be improved?
