Various sources have all claimed that Apple would\nintroduce AI-related enhancements.\n\nIt looks like the initial batch of features will function without the need for\nan internet connection.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman, writing in a section of his weekly PowerOn newsletter\nsaid on Sunday that the initial set of AI-related features Apple plans to\ndebut with iOS 18 \"will work entirely on device.\" In practice, these AI\nfeatures would be able to function without an internet connection or any form\nof cloud-based processing.\n\nWatch the Latest from AppleInsider TV\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nHands on with Apple's Journal App in iOS 17.2!\n\nShare\n\nNext\n\nStay\n\nAppleInsider has received information from individuals familiar with the\nmatter that suggest the report's claims are accurate. Apple is working on an\nin-house large language model, or LLM, known internally as \"Ajax.\"\n\nWhile more advanced features will ultimately require an internet connection,\nbasic text analysis and response generation features should be available\noffline.\n\nRegarding individual apps, we will likely see improvements to Messages,\nSafari, Spotlight Search, and Siri. Apple has been testing on-device text-\nbased response generation for a while, meaning this feature will most likely\nbe among those first previewed or released.\n\nMore advanced AI-related features and enhancements will still require an\ninternet connection. Apple reportedly discussed licensing Google and OpenAI's\nAI technology for use in iOS 18 rather than developing its own online LLM.\n\nThe significant increase in popularity of AI projects over the past few years\nis likely the reason for Apple's apparent interest in artificial intelligence.\nAI tools have become increasingly accessible to everyday consumers, and issues\nhave arisen in the legal and education sectors.\n\nOn-device processes could help eliminate certain controversies found with\nserver-side AI tools. For example, these tools have been known to hallucinate,\nmeaning they make up information confidently.\n\nAnd, the hallucination problem has only gotten worse, as AI models feed on\ncontent generated by other AI models.\n\nWith its new \"Ajax\" LLM, the company likely seeks to build a competitor to the\ntools currently on the market. By eliminating the requirement for cloud-based\nprocessing and improving the quality of text generation, the company could\ngain a significant advantage over rival AI-powered services and tools.\n\nApple will reveal its AI plans during WWDC, which starts on June 10.\n\n## Rumor Score\n\n\ud83e\udd2f\n\n### Likely\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\n18 Comments\n\n## 18 Comments\n\n## canukstorm\n\nsaid about 21 hours ago\n\nhttps://x.com/Alex4D/status/1779996362479718581\n\n## 22july2013\n\nsaid about 21 hours ago\n\nApple's upcoming AI might not require a remote server to process its AI logic,\nbut it will require an Internet connection to find many kinds of answers.\nContrary to what many people seem to think, LLMs do not contain an entire copy\nof the Internet within them.\n\n## Wesley Hilliard\n\nsaid about 20 hours ago\n\n> 22july2013 said:\n>\n> Apple's upcoming AI might not require a remote server to process its AI\n> logic, but it will require an Internet connection to find many kinds of\n> answers.
