We have observed, however, that the conventional\n> alignment process fails to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often\n> leads to the generation of more false facts (i.e. hallucination). In this\n> paper, we study how to make the LLM alignment process more factual, by first\n> identifying factors that lead to hallucination in both alignment steps:\\\n> supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular,\n> we find that training the LLM on new knowledge or unfamiliar texts can\n> encourage hallucination. This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human\n> labeled data that may be novel to the LLM. Furthermore, reward functions\n> used in standard RL can also encourage hallucination, because it guides the\n> LLM to provide more helpful responses on a diverse set of instructions,\n> often preferring longer and more detailed responses. Based on these\n> observations, we propose factuality-aware alignment, comprised of\n> factuality-aware SFT and factuality-aware RL through direct preference\n> optimization. Experiments show that our proposed factuality-aware alignment\n> guides LLMs to output more factual responses while maintaining instruction-\n> following capability.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2405.01525 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2405.01525v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.01525arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Sheng-Chieh Lin [view email] [v1] Thu, 2 May 2024 17:54:54 UTC (2,461\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled FLAME: Factuality-Aware Alignment for Large\nLanguage Models, by Sheng-Chieh Lin and 6 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2405\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
