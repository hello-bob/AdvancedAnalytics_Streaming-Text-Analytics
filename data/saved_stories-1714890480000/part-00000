Each side accuses the other of bad-faith\nnegotiating.\n\nThe company, which is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, said Saturday that\nits latest offer includes general annual wage increases and a new compensation\nstructure for firefighters on a 24-hour shift schedule that would result in an\naverage wage increase of about $21,000 a year. Boeing says firefighters were\npaid $91,000 on average last year.\n\nThe union, which argues Boeing has saved billions in insurance costs by\nemploying its own on-site firefighters, has said it\u2019s seeking raises of 40% to\n50%. Boeing\u2019s proposed pay increase would still leave crews earning 20% to 30%\nless than firefighters in the cities where Boeing plants are located, the\nunion said.\n\nA major sticking point is Boeing\u2019s demand to make firefighters wait 19 years\nto hit top pay scale, up from 14 years. The union is proposing five years.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\n  * Share this Story : Boeing locks out its private firefighters around Seattle over pay dispute\n\n    * Copy Link\n    * Email\n    * X\n    * Reddit\n    * LinkedIn\n    * Tumblr\n\nComments\n\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\n\nCreate an AccountSign in\n\nGeVestor\n\nDieser Mann wei\u00df bescheid: Megatrend Smart-FarmingExperten Geheimnisse: Wie\nein Report die Investmentstrategie ver\u00e4nderteGeVestor|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nDiane Francis: Trudeau's gross fiscal mismanagementFinancial Post\n\nGas Stove Pollution Harms Poor and Minority Americans Most, Study\nFindsFinancial Post\n\nGeVestor\n\nGoldgrube gefunden: 3 Top Aktien 2024Experten Geheimnisse: Wie ein Report die\nInvestmentstrategie ver\u00e4nderteGeVestor|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nApotheke Regional\n\n\u00c4rzte ratlos: 62-J\u00e4hrige sieht fast 20 Jahre j\u00fcnger aus dank diesem einfachen\nTrick!Apotheke Regional|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nthermondo\n\nHausbesitzer aufgepasst: G\u00fcnstiger kann man auf die W\u00e4rmepumpe nicht\numsteigen!thermondo|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nRentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nTrending\n\n  1. ### Posthaste: This missed CPP opportunity is costing Canadians thousands, says report\n\n  2. ### Killer TD variable rate mortgage could be sign of better deals to come\n\n  3. ### Posthaste: This cratering GDP number has only ever been seen during a recession\n\n  4. ### David Rosenberg: Why the Bank of Canada needs to start cutting rates ...
