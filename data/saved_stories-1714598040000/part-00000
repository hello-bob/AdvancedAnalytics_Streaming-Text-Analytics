The formation is the Taam Ja\u2019 Blue\nHole in Mexico\u2019s Chetumal Bay, and it has so far been measured to 1,378 feet\ndeep, or 420 meters below sea level.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nHuge Sinkhole Opens Up on South Australian Coast\n\nThe Best New Movies and TV Streaming in May 2024, and Where to Watch Them\n\nStudio Thought Seed of Chucky Was \u2018Too Gay, Too Funny'\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nStudio Thought Seed of Chucky Was \u2018Too Gay, Too Funny'\n\nBlue holes are huge underwater sinkholes that appear on the seafloor when the\nlimestone bedrock collapses. Some of the most famous blue holes are off\nCentral America, especially Belize\u2019s Great Blue Hole. Taam Ja\u2019 is near the\nborder of Mexico and Belize, off of Mexico\u2019s Tamalcab Island and close to\nseveral other blue holes in Chetumal Bay. Measurements of the hole\u2019s depth and\nhow current circulates through it were published this week in Frontiers in\nMarine Science.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nHuge Sinkhole Opens Up on South Australian Coast\n\nThe Best New Movies and TV Streaming in May 2024, and Where to Watch Them\n\nStudio Thought Seed of Chucky Was \u2018Too Gay, Too Funny'\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nStudio Thought Seed of Chucky Was \u2018Too Gay, Too Funny'\n\nTaam Ja\u2019 usurps the South China Sea\u2019s Dragon Hole (also called the Sansha\nYongle Blue Hole) as the deepest known blue hole. The Dragon Hole is about 990\nfeet deep, surpassing the third-deepest blue hole, Dean\u2019s Blue Hole, by over\n300 feet. The Taam Ja\u2019 Blue Hole is more than twice as deep as Dean\u2019s Blue\nHole.\n\nA 2023 survey found the hole was 900 feet deep; it\u2019s now known to be over\n1,300 feet deep.Graphic: Alc\u00e9rreca-Huerta et al., Front. Mar. Sci. 2023\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2023, the team measured the sinkhole using a CTD (conductivity,\ntemperature, and depth) profiler, a suite of electronic instruments that could\ncharacterize multiple components of the sinkhole. Comparing hydrographic data\nfrom the sinkhole with water layers in other reef lagoons, estuaries, and\nbarrier reefs in Central America and the Caribbean led the team to conclude\nthat \u201cpotential subterranean connections\u201d may exist in the hole\u2019s depths.\n\nThe CTD also revealed an increase of water temperature and salinity in the\nhole around 1,312 feet (400 meters) below sea level. The warm water may be\nrelated to volcanic or tectonic processes or geothermal activity at depth, the\nscientists concluded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers emphasized that the hole may be much deeper than their recent\nmeasurement, based on the structure of inland limestone cave systems. The team\nspecifically referenced Krubera-Voronya, the deepest-known cave, which is\n7,188 feet (2,191 meters) deep.\n\nLocation of the blue hole and images of it at (B) 16 feet deep, (C) 65 feet\ndeep, and (D) 98 feet deep.Graphic: Alc\u00e9rreca-Huerta et al., Front.

They outlined that future investigations of the hole \u201cshould\nincorporate advanced underwater navigation technologies\u201d to better explore the\nmysterious\u2014and hitherto unknown\u2014depth of the eerie hole.\n\nMore: Earth\u2019s 8 Weirdest Cave Systems\n\n", "frontpage": false}
