Several of the\naffected countries accuse Moscow of intentionally jamming signals with its\nelectronic warfare systems.\n\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, GPS interference has\nbeen recurring in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. These types of disruptions\nare common in and around conflict zones. Even so, in the last half year, the\nairspace of the three Baltic countries \u2014 in addition to that of Finland,\nSweden and Poland \u2014 has been much more affected than at the beginning of the\nwar. What\u2019s more, thousands of ships have been navigating the Baltic without\nGPS since December, when the Russian army\u2019s electronic warfare began in the\nKaliningrad enclave. And in remote northeastern Norway, near Russia\u2019s Northern\nFleet base \u2014 which has eight of the 11 Russian submarines capable of launching\nlong-range nuclear missiles \u2014 outages are almost daily.\n\nLast week, two Finnair planes had to turn around and return to Helsinki after\nfailing to reach Estonia\u2019s Tartu airport. The airline suspended the route\nbetween the Finnish capital and the second most populous city in Estonia.\nUnlike the vast majority of European airports, planes can only land at Tartu\nwith a GPS signal. Lauri Soini, chair of the Finnish Pilots Association, told\nReuters that for the past six months, GPS jamming has been affecting an \u201carea\nextending from Poland across the Baltic states to the Swedish and Finnish\ncoasts, also affecting lower altitudes and maritime traffic.\u201d\n\nEstonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsakhna reacted to the decision to pause\nflights to Tartu with a post on the social network X, in which he accused\nRussia of jamming GPS navigation devices. Tsakhna said he had spoken with his\nLatvian, Lithuanian, Finnish and Swedish counterparts and insisted that the\nmatter to be discussed among all NATO allies and EU members. In an interview\nwith the Financial Times, the minister said the interferences were part of\n\u201cRussia\u2019s hostile activities\u201d and \u201ca hybrid attack.\u201d\n\nLosing the GPS signal mid-flight does not, in principle, pose a serious risk.\nCommercial airliners have several older alternative systems. However, Dana\nGoward, director of the Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation and a\nmember of an advisory council to U.S. President Joe Biden, tells EL PA\u00cdS by\nphone that interference \u201cinevitably reduces the safety and efficiency of\naviation.\u201d Goward points out that in recent months \u201cthe risk of an accident\noccurring has increased\u201d and that Russia has several types of electronic\nwarfare systems that can disrupt GPS signals at different altitudes and\ndistances.\n\nIn addition to interference, cases of spoofing \u2014 when a device broadcasts a\nfalse GPS system to trick the receiver into believing fake location or time\nvariables \u2014 have also risen significantly.\n\nTodd Walter, director of the GPS Laboratory at Stanford University, explains\nthat trying to locate exactly where the interference is coming from is a\ncomplex process. \u201cOur estimates will never be completely precise, but\neverything indicates that the focus of the disruptions in the Baltic is\nlocated in Kaliningrad,\u201d the researcher tells EL PA\u00cdS in a video call.\n\n### \u201cHuman lives may be lost\u201d\n\nIn northeastern Norway, thousands of miles from the war front, authorities are\ntrying to adapt to life without GPS. GPS interference has been recorded on\nmore than 95% of the days since January 2023. Occasionally, at sea level,\ncitizens have lost the signal on their cell phone or have received erroneous\ninformation about their location. The Norwegian Communications Authority says\nthat at more than 1,500 meters altitude the interference is intermittent, and\nthat above 3,000 meters it is practically continuous. In addition to thousands\nof internal flights, ambulance helicopters \u2014 which provide an essential\nservice in one of the least densely populated areas in Europe \u2014 are also\naffected.\n\nAlthough the war in Ukraine has ruptured relations between Norway and Russia,\nregular meetings are still held to discuss border issues. In one of these\nmeetings, Ellen Katrine Haetta, police chief in the Finnmark region, detailed\nthe risks that interference poses to search and rescue operations. \u201cIt\u2019s very\nserious. Human lives may be lost,\u201d Haetta told local media. \u201cThe FSB [Russia\u2019s\nFederal Security Service] told me that they will investigate the matter,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\nIn the Baltic, GPS maritime navigation is increasingly rare and, given the\nrisks involved, insurers have raised the cost of premiums. Lieutenant Colonel\nJoakim Paasikivi, a member of the Swedish Defense University, told Swedish\nbroadcaster SVT that the interference to maritime navigation was \u201cpart of\nRussian influence activities, or so-called hybrid war\u201d against NATO countries.\n\nIn late April, the German Defense Ministry said, \u201cThe persistent disruptions\nto the global navigation satellite system are very likely of Russian origin,\u201d\nand specifically pointed to Kaliningrad, the Russian territory wedged between\nPoland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. In March, a plane carrying British\nDefense Minister Grant Shapps had to activate alternative global positioning\nsystems while passing through an area near the Russian territory. On December\n25 and 26, Poland recorded interference lasting more than 30 hours, which was\nspread across a large part of the country.\n\n### Electronic warfare systems\n\nRussia has powerful electronic warfare systems. Several reports from the\nCenter for Advanced Defense Studies detail the extensive spoofing campaigns\nthat the Russian army has carried out from different bases it controls in\nSyria. The Washington-based analysis center also states that, when Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin has traveled to occupied areas of Ukraine, such as\nthe Crimean peninsula or the city of Mariupol, he has been flanked by mobile\nelectronic warfare systems. During NATO\u2019s military exercises in northern\nNorway in 2018, which also involved soldiers from Sweden and Finland \u2014\nalthough they were not yet NATO members \u2014 Oslo and Helsinki accused Moscow of\ndisrupting the GPS signal in part of their territory.\n\nRussian electronic warfare systems are used daily in Ukraine to inhibit enemy\ndrone communications, and even to divert the trajectory of U.S. Himars\nmissiles. The Russian military also repeatedly jams the GPS signal around\nMoscow and St. Petersburg, or in regions far from the border where refineries\nhave been attacked by Ukrainian drones. Disturbances are also common around\nthe Black Sea, where Ukrainian water drones have repeatedly hit Russian Navy\nships.\n\nAt the end of January, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the\nInternational Air Transport Association (IATA) held a meeting in the German\ncity of Cologne to address the growing cases of interference and spoofing. In\na joint statement, EASA and IATA noted that the problems with GPS \u201cpose\nsignificant challenges to aviation safety\u201d and, in the absence of viable\ntechnical solutions in the short term, called for improved pilot training to\naddress the issue.\n\nMartin Herem, commander of the Estonian Armed Forces, said in a recent\ninterview with a local media that Russia is \u201ctesting\u201d its powerful electronic\nwarfare systems in anticipation of a future conflict with NATO. Goward and\nWalter believe this is a reasonable argument, and both have no doubt that at\nleast part of the interference in the Baltics is intentional.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Russia strikes Odesa with ballistic missiles and cluster bombs\n\nCristian Segura | Kyiv\n\n### Russia intensifies its offensive against the foreign press\n\nJavier G.
