The changes are part of an agreement\nwith a promoter to dismiss the world governing body from a lawsuit challenging\nthat policy.\n\nRelevent Sports lawyer Jeffrey L Kessler filed a letter on Monday in a\nManhattan court stating Fifa and his client agreed to the dismissal. Keller\nwrote that Fifa agreed to abide by any injunction arising from the suit, which\nalso includes US Soccer as a defendant. The agreement did not alter the suit\nagainst the US Soccer.\n\n\u201cFifa and Relevent have agreed to resolve this matter as it concerns Fifa,\npending Fifa\u2019s consideration of changes to existing Fifa policies with respect\nto playing official season games outside a league\u2019s home territory,\u201d Fifa said\nin a statement. \u201cFifa has not admitted any liability and continues to deny the\nlegal claims alleged in Relevent\u2019s complaint.\u201d\n\nA relegation push and CBS: USL\u2019s quest to become America\u2019s go-to league\n\nRead more\n\nRelevent, controlled by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, announced in August\n2018 it planned to host a La Liga match between Barcelona and Girona at Miami\nGardens, Florida, the following January.\n\nIn October 2018, Fifa said its ruling council adopted a policy that\n\u201cemphasized the sporting principle that official league matches must be played\nwithin the territory of the respective member association.\u201d Barcelona then\nwithdrew its commitment to play in Florida.\n\nRelevent in 2019 also was refused permission by US Soccer to sanction a league\nmatch between two teams from Ecuador. Relevent sued the governing bodies,\nclaiming violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and tortious interference.\n\n\u201cBringing official matches from Europe to the US is an exciting proposition\nbut it must be done thoughtfully and collaboratively,\u201d Relevent CEO Daniel\nSillman said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to partnering with Fifa to\nsupport the global growth of the game and the best leagues in the world.\u201d\n\nCaproni in July 2021 granted US Soccer\u2019s motion to dismiss the antitrust claim\nbut the case was reinstated in March 2023 by the second US circuit court of\nappeals. US Soccer asked the US supreme court in August to take the case, and\nthe Joe Biden administration last month said the supreme court should let the\nappellate decision stand.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European\nsoccer\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.
