We've received your submission.\n\nBack to Reading\n\nPublished April 29, 2024, 11:11 a.m. ET\n\nThis redefined a long-distance call.\n\nEarth just received a laser transmission from a world- (and perhaps universe)\nrecord-breaking 140 million miles away \u2014 which could have major implications\nfor the future of space travel.\n\nHowever, this correspondence wasn\u2019t extraterrestrial in origin: It was\nactually sent by NASA\u2019s Psyche spacecraft, which is currently located\napproximately 1.5 times the distance between Earth and the Sun.\n\n\u201cThis represents a significant milestone for the project by showing how\noptical communications can interface with a spacecraft\u2019s radio frequency comms\nsystem,\u201d Meera Srinivasan, the project\u2019s operations lead at NASA\u2019s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said in a statement.\n\n3\n\nEarth just received a laser transmission from a world (and perhaps universe)\nrecord-breaking 140 million miles away \u2014 which could have major implications\nfor the future of space travel. Aliaksandr Marko \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\n3\n\nThis visualization shows the Psyche spacecraft\u2019s position on April 8 when the\nDSOC flight laser transceiver transmitted data at a rate of 25 Mbps over 140\nmillion miles to a downlink station on Earth. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThis major breakthrough was achieved by using a Psyche feature called Deep\nSpace Optical Communications, or DSOC, one of the droid\u2019s several task per\nSpace.com. Its main directive is exploring 16 Psyche, the $100,000 quadrillion\nasteroid from which it takes its name.\n\n## Explore More\n\n### I'm a longevity expert \u2014 I swear by these 5 supplements for aging\n\n### My daughter heard 'monsters' in the wall \u2014 what we discovered was\nsomething out of a horror movie\n\n### Influencer runs the Brooklyn Half Marathon without registering \u2014 then\ninfuriates runners by bragging about her pace\n\nNASA wanted to show the potential for laser communications to be conducted\nacross interstellar distances, allowing for high bandwidth and a much speedier\nconnection \u2014 from 10 to 100 times faster than what\u2019s available today \u2014 between\nhumans and the probes they send into space.\n\nThis achievement was particularly significant as, along with sending the laser\nmessage a record-breaking distance, NASA also managed to transmit actual data\ngathered from the spacecraft.\n\n\u201cWe downlinked about 10 minutes of duplicated spacecraft data,\u201d explained\nSrinivasan. \u201cUntil then, we\u2019d been sending test and diagnostic data in our\ndownlinks from Psyche.\u201d\n\nTo wit, in November of last year, Psyche sent back to Earth from 10 million\nmiles away, but it was pre-loaded test data and not any \u201creal\u201d info.\n\n3\n\nThis watershed moment provides a taste of how spacecraft like Psyche\n(pictured) \u201ccould use optical communications in support of humanity\u2019s next\ngiant leap: sending humans to Mars,\u201d NASA wrote. NASA/Ben Smegelsky\n\n## see also\n\n### Earth received a message from 10M miles away \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t E.T.\n\nThis marked the culmination of a series of messages sent by the probe since it\nlaunched on October 13th atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy Rocket.\n\nDuring a prior dry run in December, Psyche beamed data back from 19 million\nmiles away, sending it at the system\u2019s maximum rate of 267 megabits per\nsecond.\n\nThis correspondence \u2014 which included footage of an orange tabby cat named\nTaters \u2014 took around just over a minute and a half to reach earth, which is\ncomparable to broadband internet speeds.\n\nBy contrast, this latest DSOC transmission was only 25 megabits. This was due\nto the fact that Psyche was seven times further away, reducing the speed at\nwhich it could send and receive messages.\n\nDespite the comparatively syrupy speed, this nonetheless eclipsed the\nproject\u2019s goal of \u201cproving at least 1 Mbps was possible at that distance,\u201d per\nthe release.\n\nThis watershed moment provides a taste of how spacecraft \u201ccould use optical\ncommunications in support of humanity\u2019s next giant leap: sending humans to\nMars,\u201d NASA wrote.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nPsyche is slated to fly by the Red Planet by 2026, whereupon it will fly\ntoward its main destination, 16 Psyche, which it should reach by 2029.\n\nLike the early pioneers\u2019 search for the Northwest Passage, it will aim to map\nout this final frontier El Dorado, which contains enough precious metals to\ncrash the gold market.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * asteroids\n  * lasers\n  * mars\n  * nasa\n  * space\n  * spacex\n  * world record\n  * 4/29/24\n\nRead Next Gen Z is ditching acronyms like Millennial-favorite 'YOLO'...\n\n#### Top Concerts\n\nVividseats: Official Ticketing Partner of New York Post Get seats.
