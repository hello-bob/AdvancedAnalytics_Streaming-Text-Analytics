A major obstacle\n> to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly\n> unavoidable quadratic complexity of \\Omega(N^2), corresponding to the\n> requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least\n> once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a\n> number of non-zero couplings that is only O(N). Here we present a general\n> algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that\n> significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline. Our algorithm relies on a\n> stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011) that produces the best\n> edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive\n> quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the second-neighbor\n> search finishes in log-linear time (Baron & Darling, 2020; 2022), we\n> demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic time,\n> with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by O(N^{3/2}\\log N),\n> but with a more typical log-linear complexity of O(N\\log^2N). In practice,\n> we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of\n> magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with\n> our theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus\n> enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even\n> millions of nodes and edges.\n\nComments:| 12 pages, 7 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Machine Learning (cs.LG);\nData Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Computation\n(stat.CO); Machine Learning (stat.ML)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2401.01404 [cs.DS]  \n(or arXiv:2401.01404v4 [cs.DS] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.01404arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Tiago Peixoto [view email] [v1] Tue, 2 Jan 2024 19:00:13 UTC (7,924 KB)\n[v2] Sun, 7 Jan 2024 09:53:43 UTC (7,924 KB) [v3] Mon, 12 Feb 2024 13:01:54\nUTC (7,924 KB) [v4] Thu, 2 May 2024 11:47:05 UTC (8,066 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Scalable network reconstruction in subquadratic\ntime, by Tiago P.
