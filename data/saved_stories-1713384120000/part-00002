Since July of\nlast year the company has lost about $400 billion in market capitalization \u2014 a\ndecline of over 40%. It\u2019s now less than half as valuable as Meta, and only\naround a quarter as valuable as Google.\n\nNo one ever really knows exactly why a stock goes up or down, but we can\nhazard a few guesses. For one thing, people are just buying fewer Teslas these\ndays:\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nAs a result, Tesla\u2019s revenue has stopped growing. Meanwhile, two executives,\nDrew Baglino and Rohan Patel, have recently quit \u2014 that could be a sign of\ninternal turmoil or a reaction to the company\u2019s dimming prospects, but either\nway it\u2019s a bad sign. Tesla also recently laid off 10% of its global workforce,\nafter a sustained hiring binge.\n\nBut stock prices don\u2019t just depend on current revenues; they also depend on\nexpectations about future revenue growth. And a massive shadow is looming over\nTesla\u2019s future growth: competition from Chinese companies.\n\nChina has been ramping up EV production enormously. That ramp-up includes\nTesla itself, of course, which makes a bunch of cars in China. But it\u2019s\nChina\u2019s own automakers that have been booming the most. BYD, the country\u2019s\nleading car company, briefly overtook Tesla in EV sales last year. And plenty\nof other companies are entering the race, including Xiaomi, a mobile phone\nmaker who recently started to make affordably priced, stylish, high-\nperformance electric cars.\n\nBy JustAnotherCarDesigner - Own work, CC0\n\nChinese companies are beginning to squeeze Tesla out of the Chinese market,\nand providing stiff competition in Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia,\nand elsewhere (Chinese EVs aren\u2019t sold in the U.S. yet). BYD and the rest make\ngood-quality products, but more importantly, they\u2019re able to offer them at\nunbeatable prices. A BYD Atto 3 sells for around $39k to $48k in Australia,\nwhile a Tesla Model 3 sells for $62k to $72k.\n\nTesla\u2019s answer to this was supposed to be to go even cheaper. The company had\npromised to create a $25,000 electric car \u2014 a true mass-market vehicle that\nwould bring EVs to the masses at last. But Elon Musk recently nixed the plan,\nchoosing to focus on driverless taxis instead. When the $25,000 EV arrives, it\nwill be a Chinese company who makes it.\n\nNot everyone is upset about this, of course. Elon Musk\u2019s detractors are prone\nto schadenfreude, viewing Tesla\u2019s decline as karmic punishment for letting the\nantisemites and Russian propagandists back onto Twitter. But I think this\nreaction is shortsighted. To see a champion of U.S. industry and innovation go\ndown to fast-following Chinese rivals shouldn\u2019t make any American happy. And\nthe same techniques that China is using to defeat Tesla will be used to defeat\nany other American competitor.\n\nSo we should be thinking very hard about how China did this, and what the U.S.\nand allied countries can do to prevent it from happening again, and again, and\nagain.\n\n####\n\nThe China Cycle: How Western innovations end up benefitting Chinese companies\n\n## Keep reading with a 7-day free trial\n\nSubscribe to Noahpinion to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free\naccess to the full post archives.\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
