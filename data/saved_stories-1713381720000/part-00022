I\u2019ll try to explain. Last weekend I had the unique\nthrill of watching pop-culture icons Batman and the Joker make a guest-\nappearance on STATIC SHOCK, the Kids WB animated series I co-created. It looks\nlike the episode went over well with the audience, too. I\u2019ve read many good\nreviews. I\u2019ve received well-wishes from dozens of fans. I\u2019ve got some great\ne-mails from little kids who discovered the show only because Batman was on\nit. All in all, an unexpected triumph.Except...Except there are some comic\nbook fans who are confused by what the crossover does to the continuity of the\nDC and Milestone universes (answer: nothing, actually) or to the continuity of\nDC Comics\u2019 animated shows (answer: nothing that matters, really). There\u2019s just\na few of those guys out there, mind you but they\u2019re strident. Anyone who has\nread my old columns knows my radical stance on comic book continuity (part 2\nis here. Click the links if you care). The short version is this, I think\ncomic book continuity should be treated as TV continuity traditionally has,\nthat is to say, every show has its own, individual continuity - even when that\nshow shares characters from other shows. The old sit-coms Seinfeld and Mad\nAbout You share characters but both shows conveniently ignore that fact\nwhenever they feel like it. This allows them to have all the fun of\ncrossovers, without the silly baggage of both shows having to keep it all\nstraight (and, wonder of wonders, you can watch and enjoy either show without\never watching the other one).This is the right answer for comics too, because\ncomplex interlocking storylines across dozens of series will inherently prove\nto be absurd. Let me demonstrate.For the purposes of our demonstration, we\npostulate that any TV show that shares characters with another series is in\nthe same universe as that series. With the help of the guys at the Milestone\nE-group and their discovery of a wondrous TV crossover website that lists an\nastonishingly large list of spinoffs and crossovers, I will first reveal to\nyou a stunning tapestry of interconnected TV shows, then prove that none of\nthose shows' episodes actually occurred. I\u2019ll do the last with two magic\nwords: St. Elsewhere.For those of you don\u2019t know, St. Elsewhere was a slick,\nwell written and acted drama series about the doctors, administrators and\npatients of the fictional Boston hospital, St. Eligius (nicknamed St.\nElsewhere by the staff). After a long, award-winning run, in the very last\nmoments of the show\u2019s final episode, it was revealed that all of the events of\nthe show were merely the prolonged daydream of an autistic child. None of it\n\"really\" happened. Whether you like this final twist (for what it\u2019s worth, I\ndidn\u2019t), it\u2019s a legitimate ending to a self-contained show. But if St.\nElsewhere played by the rules of comics, either they wouldn\u2019t have been\nallowed to do it, or they would have precipitated a crisis in TV Land far\nbloodier than DC Comics\u2019 Crisis On Infinite Earths. Why? Because crossover-\nwise, St. Elsewhere is the Kevin Bacon of TV shows.Stay with me now, this is\ncomplicated but kind of fun.Characters from St. Elsewhere have appeared on\nHomicide, which means that show is part of the autistic child\u2019s daydream and\nlikewise doesn\u2019t exist. It gets worse. The omnipresent Detective John Munch\nfrom Homicide has appeared on X-Files, Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU. Law &\nOrder characters have appeared on Law & Order: Criminal Intent. X-Files\ncharacters have appeared on The Lone Gunmen and Millennium. Characters from\nChicago Hope have appeared on Homicide. Characters from Picket Fences have\nappeared on Chicago Hope. All those shows are gone (if you count cartoons,\nwhich makes this game much too easy, the X-Files characters have appeared on\nThe Simpsons. The Critic has also appeared on The Simpsons. Dead).Characters\nfrom Picket Fences have appeared on Ally McBeal. Ally McBeal has appeared on\nThe Practice. Characters from The Practice have appeared on Boston Public.\nAutistic daydreams, every one.But that's not all. St Elsewhere characters have\nappeared on Cheers, so Fraiser doesn\u2019t exist. Neither do Wings, Caroline In\nThe City or The Tortellis but who cares? Well, maybe you do, because Caroline\nIn The City once crossed over with Friends, which crossed over with Mad About\nYou, which crossed over with Seinfeld and The Dick Van Dyke show. None of them\nhappened in our new, shared continuity.St. Elsewhere also shared characters\nwith The White Shadow and It\u2019s Gary Shandling\u2019s Show. Garry Shandling crossed\nover with The Andy Griffith show (no, really!). So Gomer Pyle, Mayberry RFD,\nand Make Room for Daddy/The Danny Thomas Show are gone. Make Room For Daddy\ntakes out I love Lucy.And there\u2019s more, St. Elsewhere also shares continuity\nwith M*A*S*H, so Aftermash and Trapper John MD are out of there.Now here\u2019s a\ngood one, St. Elsewhere shared a patient with The Bob Newhart Show, so the Bob\nNewhart Show is part of the grand daydream. The Bob Newhart Show crossed over\nwith Murphy Brown, which in turn links to, among many others: Julia, The\nNanny, Everybody Loves Raymond and I Dream of Jeannie! Meanwhile, the series\nNewhart was revealed to be a nightmare had by Bob Newhart\u2019s character on the\nBob Newhart Show. Newhart crossed over with Coach, which connects it to Grace\nUnder Fire, Ellen and Drew Carey. Drew Carey takes out Home Improvement and\nNYPD Blue.All of these shows (and many more that I left out or missed) are\ndaydreams of St. Elsewhere\u2019s autistic kid.This is by no means an exhaustive\nlist. Links to the Happy Days, All In The Family and Diagnosis Murder\nuniverses would take out another 20 or 30 shows. If we can get to The Mary\nTyler Moore Show, who knows how many would fall? My favorite possibility? A\nlink to Knight Rider, of all things, would remove every single Star Trek\nseries. I wouldn\u2019t mind some research help from my vast and loony readership\non these and any other shows you guys can think of, E-mail me. No cartoons\nthough, that way lies madness. The Scooby Doo movies alone encompass a good\nchunk of the space/time continuum.All of these would help me prove my Grand\nUnification Theory, which posits: \"The last five minutes of St. Elsewhere is\nthe only television show, ever. Everything else is a daydream.\"So what does\nthis prove, other than the fact that I\u2019ve got too much free time? Well, my\npoint and I do have one (I can steal this catch phrase because, as I\u2019ve\nalready proven, Ellen never existed), is that while guest-shots and crossovers\ncan be fun, obsessive, cross-series continuity is silly.It\u2019s silly in comics\ntoo. Relax and enjoy the show.\\-------------------Dwayne McDuffie is the co-\ncreator of STATIC SHOCK (returning to the Kids WB! on Saturday, January 26 at\n8:30 AM and guest-starring Batman, no less).
