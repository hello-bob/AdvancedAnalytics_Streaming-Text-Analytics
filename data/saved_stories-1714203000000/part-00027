(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nThe Northeast corridor is America\u2019s busiest rail line. Each day, its trains\ndeliver 800,000 passengers to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington and\npoints in between.\n\nThe Northeast corridor is also a name for the place those trains serve: the\ncoastal plain stretching from Virginia to Massachusetts, where over 17% of the\ncountry\u2019s population lives on less than 2% of its land. Northeasterners ride\nthe corridor and live there too.\n\nLike \u201cRust Belt,\u201d \u201cDeep South,\u201d \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d and \u201cAppalachia,\u201d \u201cCorridor\u201d\nhas become shorthand for what many people think of as the Northeast\u2019s defining\nfeatures: its brisk pace of life, high median incomes and liberal politics. In\n1961, Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona wished someone had \u201csawed off\nthe Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea.\u201d In 2016, conservative F.H.\nBuckley disparaged \u201clawyers, academics, trust-fund babies and high-tech\nworkers, clustered in the Acela Corridor.\u201d\n\nAs a scholar of language and literature, I\u2019m interested in what words can\nteach us about places. My new book, \u201cThe Northeast Corridor,\u201d shows how\nAmerica\u2019s most important rail line has shaped the Northeast\u2019s cultural\nidentity and national reputation for almost 200 years. In my view, this bond\nbetween transit and territory will only strengthen as new federal investments\nin passenger service draw more Northeasterners aboard trains.\n\nIf the Northeast corridor region were an economy, it would be the fifth-\nlargest in the world. (Northeast Corridor Infrastructure and Operations\nAdvisory Committee, CC BY-ND)\n\n#### Forming a great chain\n\nThe first American railroads were stubs \u2013 strap iron curiosities that hauled\nmarble, granite and coal in winter months when canals froze. It was not until\n1830 that the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad opened the nation\u2019s first public\npassenger line.\n\nRailway mania ensued. Within a few years, trains were crisscrossing the\nEastern Seaboard. A new periodical, The Railroad Journal, predicted that\ntracks would one day form a \u201cgreat chain which, is in our day to stretch along\nthe Atlantic coast, and bring its chief capitals into rapid, constant, and\nmutually beneficial relation.\u201d\n\nThe Boston & Providence Railroad forged one link of this chain in New England.\nThe Philadelphia & Trenton cast another in Pennsylvania, and the Philadelphia,\nWilmington, & Baltimore hammered out a third through Delaware and Maryland.\nNamed for the cities they linked, these carriers helped turn a collection of\nrival ports into a cohesive economic unit.\n\nDespite their rapid growth, each railroad remained a separate fiefdom beset by\nits own state mandates, financial shortfalls and technological limitations. An\nantebellum train trip from Baltimore to New York would have required multiple\ntransfers and two ferry rides, and taken most of a day.\n\nThe \u201cgreat chain\u201d began to take modern shape in the late 19th century as\ncorporate consolidations created two highly resourced super carriers: the New\nHaven and Pennsylvania railroads. Engineering advances permitted the\nconstruction of new bridges, embankments and terminals. With the opening of a\ntunnel under the Hudson River from New Jersey to Manhattan in New York City in\n1910, and a bridge over Hell Gate Strait between the New York boroughs of\nQueens and the Bronx in 1917, trains could roll continuously between New\nEngland and the Chesapeake region.\n\nA crowd awaits the arrival of evangelist Billy Sunday at Pennsylvania Station\nin New York City, Jan. 1, 1915. (Library of Congress)\n\n#### Connecting a megalopolis\n\nRailroading became a way of life for Northeasterners. Physicist Albert\nEinstein liked watching trains click-clack through Princeton Junction during\nhis time at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in the\n1930s and 1940s.\n\nComposer George Gershwin, who rode by rail from New York to Boston, claimed\nthat \u201cit was on the train with its steely rhythms, its rattlety bang\u201d that \u201cI\nsuddenly heard \u2013 and even saw on paper \u2013 the complete construction of\n\u2018Rhapsody [in Blue]\u2019 from beginning to end.\u201d\n\nTheir fellow passengers included luminaries like poet Marianne Moore, jazz\ncomposer and pianist Duke Ellington and orchestra conductor Leopold Stokowski,\nalong with countless ordinary riders whose lives sprawled across the region.\n\nIn 1961, French-Ukrainian geographer Jean Gottmann called the Northeast a \u201cnew\norder in the organization of inhabited space.\u201d Gottmann observed that unlike\nEuropean nations, which developed around dominant capitals like London and\nRome, the United States grew from a \u201cpolynuclear\u201d fusion of cities and suburbs\nthat he called \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d\n\nThe relative proximity of megapolitan cities generated a \u201ctidal current of\ncommuting\u201d between them, which Gottman experienced firsthand while riding\ntrains between academic appointments in Baltimore, Princeton and Manhattan.\n\nOne of Gottman\u2019s adherents, Rhode Island Sen. Claiborne Pell, imagined the\nNortheast in 1962 as \u201cone long metropolitan industrial unit.\u201d A frequent\nrider, Pell believed that trains played an essential role in the region\u2019s\ninterlocking economy.\n\n#### Amtrak takes over\n\nAs railroads lost riders to cars, buses and jets in the 1960s, Pell urged\nPresident John F. Kennedy to create a government agency that would operate\npassenger trains for the public good. He called the tracks between Boston and\nWashington a \u201cpassageway for gargantuan surges of movement along our Northeast\nseaboard\u201d \u2013 or, a \u201ccorridor\u201d for short.\n\nThe name stuck. When Amtrak took over U.S. intercity passenger rail travel in\n1971, the Northeast corridor hosted its most popular trains \u2013 including the\nstylish, if breakdown-prone Metroliners, which whisked business-class\npassengers between New York and Washington at velocities topping 100 mph.\n\nBy 1978, the Northeast accounted for over half of Amtrak\u2019s ridership. The\nregion\u2019s rail revival convinced Congress to spend US$1.75 billion in the 1980s\non the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, a multi-year effort to\nmodernize the line, renovate stations and trim schedules.\n\nIn 2000, Amtrak debuted the Acela Express, a sleek and pricey train that was\nbilled as the first U.S. high-speed passenger rail service. Acela grew\nsynonymous with its well-heeled clients, but seldom reached its top speed of\n150 mph on the corridor\u2019s curving and congested tracks.\n\nThe train still became a symbol for Northeasterness. Pundits took to calling\nthe presidential nominating contests held on the same day in Rhode Island,\nConnecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland the \u201cAcela Primary.\u201d\nConservatives railed against \u201cAcela Corridor\u201d ways of thought.\n\nThe $16 billion Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project will build a new rail tunnel\nunder the Hudson River from New Jersey to New York and renovate the existing\n100-year-old tunnel.\n\nToday, President Joe Biden \u2013 a longtime corridor commuter \u2013 is proposing to\nkick off a \u201csecond great rail revolution,\u201d with billions of dollars in funding\nto strengthen and expand Amtrak\u2019s network.\n\nHigh-speed rail projects in California, Nevada and Texas, meanwhile, promise\nto bring world-class service to the West and South. Construction has begun on\nBrightline West, a high-speed link from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. What these\nventures will make of their regions remains unseen. But if the Northeast\ncorridor is any indication, new passenger trains will redefine both the\nworking lives and cultural perceptions of those who use them.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect that the Institute for Advanced Study\nin Princeton, New Jersey is not affiliated with Princeton University.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons\nlicense.
