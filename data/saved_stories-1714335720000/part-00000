The tools they adopt and advocate for impact their reputation. You\nmight have heard \u201cno one ever got fired for buying IBM\u201d in reference to making\ngood choices.\n\nBut picking older, well-adopted tools can be at odds with how fast the\nindustry moves. Is there a newer alternative that solves my needs better? Ask\nyour developer.\n\nKeeping up the latest trends is part of their job. They need to know what's a\nfad and what's here to stay. This is why experienced developers become\nskeptical of almost everything. It's hard to earn their trust.\n\nDeveloper marketing is about building trust. Here's what's worked for me.\n\n## How can I improve my developer marketing?\n\n  1. Don\u2019t publish content you wouldn\u2019t share yourself.\n  2. Always consider how you can build developer trust. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction. It\u2019s reflected in every product and marketing decision you make.\n  3. When something sucks with your product, own it. Don\u2019t try to hide the failure. Lean into it. Bring the community along for the continuous iteration of your product. \u201cYou told us this was bad, and we fixed it\u201d. Follow up with people after you ship.\n  4. Get involved in the community. Host, attend, or sponsor a hackathon or meetup. Spend time talking to developers 1:1. Their feedback drives product improvements and content ideas. Where are people struggling? Write about that.\n  5. Create a developer experience so good that it does marketing for you. Write docs worth sharing, filled with helpful diagrams and detailed descriptions. Create code examples and templates that help developers get started quickly.\n\n## Throw out the old playbook\n\nDevelopers love great marketing, but most companies get it wrong.\n\nThey\u2019re trying to apply the enterprise marketing playbook to the wrong\naudience.\n\n  * Enterprise Marketing\n\n    * Goal: Grow pipeline and revenue\n    * Audience: Directors, VPs, or C-suite\n    * Buyer Interests: Increased efficiency, cost savings, innovation\n    * How: Sales-served, sign a yearly contract for a discount\n  * Developer Marketing\n\n    * Goal: Grow retained signups and community awareness\n    * Audience: Individual developers\n    * Buyer Interests: Transferable skills, affordable, great developer experience\n    * How: Self-serve, start free then swipe a credit card\n\n## What does great developer marketing look like?\n\nI\u2019m a developer who works at the intersection of engineering, product, and\nmarketing. Based on my experience, the best developer marketing:\n\n  1. Teaches how to build great products\n  2. Builds and retains trust\n  3. Uses precise language\n\n### How did they build that!?\n\nWhen I see a great developer tool, my first thought is: how did they build\nthat?\n\nThiago Duarte\n\n@dooart_dev\n\n\u00b7Follow\n\nthis is so fast it is actually weird, my brain seems unable to accept such\nfast UI on an ecommerce website\n\nGuillermo Rauch\n\n@rauchg\n\nThe fastest storefront I've ever seen. So excited about the new Next.js\nCommerce powered by App Router. Headless backend by @shopify.\n\nWatch on Twitter\n\n3:06 PM \u00b7 Jul 25, 2023\n\n52\n\nReply\n\nRead 3 replies\n\nThere\u2019s a natural curiosity. I want to reverse engineer the product and learn\nnew tools or skills I can apply to my work.\n\nThe best developer marketing shows how to build great product experiences.\nBonus points if you capture the \u201ccurrent thing\u201d \u2013 a new AI tool, or a popular\nstyle of app (TikTok clone).\n\nGreat developer marketing is invoking this response as a service.\n\nBrian Jordan\n\n@bcjordan\n\n\u00b7Follow\n\nReplying to @rauchg\n\nMy first thought was damn the link navigations are snappy as hell\n\n3:35 AM \u00b7 Jan 8, 2024\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nRead more on Twitter\n\n### Zero days since the latest JavaScript framework\n\nDevelopers don\u2019t try your product the first time they hear about it. They\ncertainly don\u2019t want to talk to someone to get access first.\n\nThey need to hear positive feedback several times before they trust it enough\nto try. That's why building, growing, and retaining developer trust is\neverything.\n\nTrust comes from your marketing being helpful regardless of the product. And\nretention comes from making something developers actually want.\n\nIndividual developers are tired of enterprise marketing being used on them.\nThey\u2019re the wrong audience\u2014they don\u2019t want the cold calls or unhelpful emails.\nAnd if you lose their trust, they\u2019re quick to move on to other products.\n\nTrust is built (or lost) through the content you create and put out into the\ncommunity. It\u2019s a reflection of what you stand for.\n\nHere are some of my red flags when reading developer content:\n\n  * Buzzwords and acronyms: Sometimes these are necessary, but there\u2019s a lot of copywriting that looks like \u201ccutting-edge, LLM-powered RAG platform\u201d when it should really be \u201cbring knowledge to your AI model\u201d. Acronyms also alienate newcomers.\n  * Misusing technical terms: \"Our JavaScript framework helps you make responsive websites\u201d \u2013 does it though, or is that CSS? This can degrade trust because it shows the author might not have a deep understanding of the subject. Another example is broken or incorrectly formatted code examples. Did they even check that it works?\n  * Overpromising simplicity: The developer ecosystem is too obsessed with simplicity. I\u2019m guilty. While \u201cget started in one click\u201d might be good sometimes, it can also be harmful. Maybe I want more options? \"Simply install our SDK\" might not be as simple as it sounds.\n  * Vague explanations: Developers want a practical example of what your product does. \u201cUtilizing the latest technology to supercharge your development process\u201d. Is this an editor, framework, database, or something else?\n\nDevelopers are more likely to trust open-source tools. These tools likely have\na community of other developers learning together. They can take their\nknowledge of the tool from job to job as they grow in their career.\n\n### Show, don\u2019t tell\n\nGreat developer marketing is both concise and precise.\n\nIt values your time\u2014every word matters. Show them how to build interesting\nthings, don\u2019t fill a post with 1000 words of garbage.\n\nConsider an email announcing a new version of your product. The pricing has\nchanged, and there's a data migration.\n\n  * How can I make it concise?\n\n    * Put the bottom line up front: If I stop reading after the first paragraph, did I get what I needed to know? Is there action required? Put that in the email subject line.\n    * Make it easy to scan: The visual flow of the content is as important as the words you choose. They should be able to quickly scan for landmarks (like code examples or commands they need to run).\n  * How can I make it precise?\n\n    * Address their fears directly: This email mentions a migration. Am I going to lose my data? Do I need to make changes right away? Am I going to be charged more?\n    * Personalize the content: Show them their team name, the date the migration starts and finishes in UTC, exactly how much their price was before and after, and how they can take action (maybe a CLI command that shows their usage).\n\n## What do you want them to remember?\n\nYour product is competing between thousands of others for developer mindshare.\nYou believe yours is better. How do you share that message?\n\nLet the product speak for itself. Listen to customer feedback and iterate. If\nyour marketing isn\u2019t working, their feedback should tell you why.\n\nNaval\n\n@naval\n\n\u00b7Follow\n\nYou\u2019re doing sales because you failed at marketing. You\u2019re doing marketing\nbecause you failed at product.\n\n10:11 PM \u00b7 Mar 20, 2022\n\n23.8K\n\nReply\n\nRead 1.1K replies\n\nThis tweet is provocative, but it makes a point: you can't fix a bad product\nwith more marketing and sales. When you believe in the product, you don\u2019t need\nto speak down against others. I prefer to do the opposite.\n\nI believe in optimism for software, the web, and the community I\u2019m building. I\nwant people to remember I was helpful, positive, and enthusiastic about the\nproduct.\n\n## Wait, what about DevRel?\n\nDeveloper Relations is more than only developer marketing. It's the\nintersection between product, engineering, marketing, and sales.\n\nFor early companies, you might only need DevRel. They are generalists. But as\nyou grow, you need to specialize. Get the right leaders for both developers\nand enterprise marketing.\n\nDeveloper marketing leaders come from non-marketing roles (engineering,\ndeveloper relations). They love showing developers how to build amazing\nthings.\n\nEnterprise marketing leaders come from traditional marketing roles (content,\nproduct marketing, growth). They can sell to developers, even if not one, and\nknow how to build a pipeline generating engine.\n\nIt\u2019s possible for one person to do both sides of marketing well, but rare.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
