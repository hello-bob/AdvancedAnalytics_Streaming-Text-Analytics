Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nLive Nation and Ticketmaster may finally face a federal antitrust lawsuit\nafter years of criticism from fans and politicians over how the entertainment\ngiant may have abused its power as the dominant force in the live music\nindustry.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust\ndivision is preparing to file a lawsuit against Live Nation in the next few\nweeks. No exact date was given, nor were specific details about the suit. But\nsources reportedly said it would accuse Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster,\nof using its standing and power in the industry to undermine competition.\n\nA rep for Live Nation did not immediately return Rolling Stone\u2019s request for\ncomment. A rep for the DOJ\u2019s antitrust division declined to comment.\n\nThe suit will potentially arrive two years after the DOJ launched an\ninvestigation into Live Nation and Ticketmaster. While the probe had begun\nearlier in the year, it was first revealed in Nov. 2022 after Ticketmaster\u2019s\ndisastrous on-sale rollout for Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. The debacle put a\nmagnifying glass on many issues that had long dogged fans, like wait times and\nhigh price mark-ups. Politicians soon piled on, too, expressing concerns about\nanticompetitive practices and Live Nation\u2019s alleged monopoly over the live\nentertainment industry.\n\nLive Nation has repeatedly pushed back against these accusations. Just last\nmonth, the company\u2019s head of corporate affairs, Dan Wall, published an essay\nthat argued against the claim that the alleged monopoly was the reason for\nhigh ticket prices. Instead, Wall said, it was artists who set ticket prices\nand that the biggest stars in the world could command high prices because\n\u201cdemand is regularly well in excess of the supply in tickets.\u201d As for\nTicketmaster\u2019s infamous fees, Wall argued they\u2019re not \u201cjunk fees,\u201d but\nnecessary to cover operational costs for venues and the ticket seller.\n\n## Trending\n\n### O.J.

But\nits merger with Live Nation \u2014 the biggest concert promoter and venue operator\n\u2014 in 2010 is the source of many of the modern complaints about the practices\nof the entwined companies. Among them is the accusation that Live Nation has\npressured concert venues into using Ticketmaster over other ticketing systems\n\u2014 an anti-competition allegation that nearly led the DOJ to sue Live Nation in\n2019. (A settlement was ultimately reached.)\n\nWhile Ticketmaster reportedly holds over 80% of the primary ticket sale\nmarket, a spokesperson for the company argued to the WSJ that it actually\nfaces \u201cmore competition today than it has ever had, and the deal terms with\nvenues show it has nothing close to monopoly power.\u201d\n\n### More News\n\n  * ### Ariana Grande's Grandmother Makes History As Oldest Person on Hot 100\n\n    * Grande News\n    * By\n\nTom\u00e1s Mier\n\n  * ### Future and Metro Boomin Are Anti-Heroes in Search of a Good Time on \u2018We Still Don\u2019t Trust You\u2019\n\n    * ALBUM REVIEW\n    * By\n\nJayson Buford\n\n  * ### 'Rolling Stone Writers' Room' to toast Stephen Wilson Jr., Charley Crockett and Drayton Farley with George Dickel\n\n    * By\n\nRolling Stone\n\n  * ### Courtney Love Vs.
