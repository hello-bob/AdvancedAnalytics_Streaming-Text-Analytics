It is available in TSO under the operating systems MVS, MVS/XA,\nMVS/ESA, OS/390 and z/OS. RPF is intended to be used by experienced people,\nwho have a good knowledge of IBM mainframes and mainframe operating systems.\nRPF is for use with 24-bit and 31-bit MVS operating systems (MVS 3.7 and\nabove). RPF is written in S/370 assembler (IFOX00), but can be translated with\nAssembler-H (IEV90) or HL-Assembler (ASMA90).\n\n## Roots of RPF\n\nRPF was developed because in the 1980's we did not have a \"state of the art\"\neditor in MVS. IBM has a beautiful editor in TSO called ISPF. My employer did\nnot choose to pay for ISPF because the standard editor was Roscoe. ISPF was\ntoo expensive and TSO was not used very much in those days.\n\nWhen I started to work at this employer I had a TSO background for many years.\nSo I felt that I needed a fullscreen editor in TSO and MVS. That was the\nreason to develop an editor by myself. I wrote the fullscreen editor (RPF) in\nthe evening hours on my employer's computer. My employer permitted me to use\nthe computer for this project. After months of development and programming,\nthe first prototype of RPF was available for testing. Many collegues tested\nRPF and reported bugs and suggestions to me. Finally RPF became available for\nproduction. For many years we worked with RPF continued to improve it in\nsubsequent releases. In 1984 MVS and TSO became so common that my employer\ndecides to pay for IBM's ISPF product. Until the 1990's we used both RPF and\nISPF. After a few years ISPF had replaced RPF and RPF was not used anymore. At\nthat time I decided to stop the development of RPF.\n\nBrowse on a large screen with 62 lines and 160 columns\n\nIn the famous year 2000, the S/370 and S/390 emulator Hercules became\navailable. With Hercules you are able to run MVS and its successors on a PC\nplatform. The first version of Hercules ran only in Linux. Later, the Windows\nversion became available. Suddenly I and many other \"Herculeans\" had the\navailability of a mainframe on our own PC's. IBM decided to make MVS 3.8J\navailable for common use, so you don't need to pay license fees anymore for\nthe base MVS. However ISPF was not available for public domain use, because\nISPF is still used and is a copyrighted product. MVS/TSO without a full-screen\neditor is not a very good option, so I decided to make RPF available to\nHercules users running MVS on their personal computers. Desiring to make a\nfull-screen editor available for myself and these users, I restarted\ndevelopment of RPF.\n\n## Functions of RPF\n\nRPF consists of 1 version which runs on all MVS like platforms (MVS38J,\nMVS380, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, OS/390 and z/OS). In MVS/XA and above and MVS/380,\nRPF uses extended addressing to run in 31 bit mode. RPF is started in TSO as a\ncommand processor. After logon to TSO, the command \"RPF\" is sufficient to have\nall the functions of RPF available to you. The functions of RPF are:\n\n  * Edit of card-image records l like parameter decks and source-code of programs like PL/1, Cobol, Fortran and last but not least Assembler.\n  * Edit other data sets or members with fixed or variable records up to 255 bytes.\n  * Browse/View files and members of Partitioned Datasets (PDS) under MVS.\n  * Browse/View files with undefined records like LOAD modules.\n  * Compile (assemble) of Assembler source code and to link-edit the code to executable programs.\n  * Creation (allocation) of MVS data sets and Delete of MVS data sets.\n  * List the Volume Table Of Contents (VTOC) of DASD volumes. Also you can browse, edit, delete, uncatalog, catalog and compress (PDS only) datasets in a \"dataset selection list\"\n  * Execute TSO commands.\n  * Display, requeue, print and delete JOB output.\n  * Edit, Browse of Librarian modules. Librarian is a product of Computer Associates (Broadcom). Librarian is not a part of RPF. Only the free-to-distribute FAIR routines of Librarian are used.\n  * Edit, Browse Panvalet modules. Panvalet is a product of Computer Associates (Broadcom).\n  * Edit, Browse, print and delete ARCHIVER items. ARCHIVER can be dowloaded from www.cbttape.org file 147\n  * Move and Copy of PDS members.\n  * Reset and Delete ISPF statistics.\n  * Search data sets for strings of data.\n\n## Installation of RPF\n\nRPF is distributed as seven unloaded partitioned datasets, that can be\nreceived with e.g. IND$FILE on your 3270 emulated terminal. The zip files\ncontaining the RPF unloaded PDS's and the RPF User's Guide can be downloaded\nin the table below.\n\n## Release 1.9.7 available\n\nThe updates of this release are:\n\n  * EDIT: Top of data line added;\n  * BROWSE: Bottom of data line added;\n  * Library, Move/Copy, DS-List, Archiver, Librarian: END data line added with totals;\n  * Library/Arschiver: Confirm member delete can be selected;\n  * Move/Copy (option 3.3): All types of sequential datasets can be copied;\n  * Some 0C4 abends fixed;\n  * Small enhancements.\n\nRPF 1.9.7 will replace older releases of RPF.\n\nRPF 1.9.7 has been tested on MVS38J, MVS380 and z/OS.\n\nRPF 1.9.7 is distributed as 7 zipped XMI files to make the installation\neasier. Install these files with Hercules DASDLOAD, with RECV370 or with TSO\nRECEIVE.\n\nClick here for an example of an RECV370 job. Alternatively you can run the TSO\nRECEIVE command after upload with PC-3270 File Transfer (IND$FILE).\n\n## Current releases\n\nRPF 1.9.7 MVS38J load library (required for MVS)| 1.9.7| April 12, 2024|\nDownload  \n---|---|---|---  \nRPF 1.9.7 z/OS load library (required for z/OS)| 1.9.7| April 12, 2024|\nDownload  \nRPF 1.9.7 HELP library (required)| 1.9.7| April 11, 2024| Download  \nRPF 1.9.7 JCL library (required)| 1.9.7| April 11, 2024| Download  \nRPF 1.9.7 Source (optional)| 1.9.7| April 12, 2024| Download  \nRPF 1.9.7 Maclib (optional)| 1.9.7| April 11, 2024| Download  \nRPF 1.9.7 ISPF panels| 1.9.7| April 11, 2024| Download  \nRPF 1.9.7 User's Guide| 1.9.7| April 11, 2024| Download  \nRPF 1.9.6 MVS38J load library (required for MVS)| 1.9.6| December 10, 2023|\nDownload  \nRPF 1.9.6 z/OS load library (required for z/OS)| 1.9.6| December 10, 2023|\nDownload  \nRPF 1.9.6 HELP library (required)| 1.9.6| December 10, 2023| Download  \nRPF 1.9.6 JCL library (required)| 1.9.6| December 10, 2023| Download  \nRPF 1.9.6 Source (optional)| 1.9.6| December 10, 2023| Download  \nRPF 1.9.6 Maclib (optional)| 1.9.6| December 10, 2023| Download  \nRPF 1.9.6 ISPF panels| 1.9.6| December 10, 2023| Download  \nRPF 1.9.6 User's Guide| 1.9.6| December 10, 2023| Download  \n  \nRelease notes\n\nYou can also find RPF on the CBT-tape website (file 415).

With this feature RPF can have up to 1 million\nworkspace lines for editing large data sets.\n\nI have written an SMP4 usermod to install this feature. This usermod needs\nGreg Price's usermod ZP60033. This usermod add the LOC operand in GETMAIN.\n\nClick on the button below to download the MVS380 usermod.\n\nDownload MVS380 usermod\n\n2024 Prince Webdesign\n\n", "frontpage": false}
