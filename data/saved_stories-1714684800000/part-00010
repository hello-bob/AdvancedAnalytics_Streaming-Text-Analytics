These include:\n\n  * One of the men molested her while he was sitting on her\n  * Despite being handcuffed and restrained, she fought back, kicking and swearing\n  * An admission that this provoked the men to beat her to death with batons\n  * An IRGC officer ordered the men to dump her body on a street\n\nThe BBC report acknowledges there are numerous fake Iranian official documents\nin circulation, but says \u201cextensive investigations indicate the papers we\nobtained do chronicle the teenager's last movements\u201d.\n\nThe BBC also put the allegations to the IRGC and the Iranian government before\npublication and they did not respond.\n\nMiddle East\n\nBBC\n\nIran\n\n2022 Iran protests\n\nRelated\n\nWATCH\n\n## Watch: Inside Lebanon's ghost towns after Israeli strikes\n\n17 hrs ago\n\nMiddle East\n\n## Gaza hostage's mother pleads for ceasefire deal\n\n1 day ago\n\nMiddle East\n\n## Southern Lebanon: BBC sees air strike destruction in deserted towns\n\n2 days ago\n\nMiddle East\n\nMore\n\n1 hr ago\n\n## Presenters lose part of legal case against BBC\n\nTheir equal pay claims won't go to a tribunal, but claims including sex and\nage discrimination will.\n\n1 hr ago\n\nEntertainment & Arts\n\n5 hrs ago\n\n## Former BBC journalist alleges police surveillance\n\nVincent Kearney believes the PSNI may have tried to identify his sources for a\nSpotlight programme.\n\n5 hrs ago\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n1 day ago\n\n## Four presenters begin legal action against BBC\n\nThey claim age and sex discrimination and say they were paid less than a male\npeer, which the BBC denies.\n\n1 day ago\n\nEntertainment & Arts\n\n3 days ago\n\n## Armed forces killed Iran teen, evidence suggests\n\nRevolutionary Guards' papers passed to the BBC give chilling details of Nika\nShakarami\u2019s last movements.\n\n3 days ago\n\nMiddle East\n\n3 days ago\n\n## BBC's The Green Planet 'boosted UK economy by \u00a37.4m'\n\nThe Green Planet, filmed in 127 countries, was produced in Bristol where it\nsupported 50 jobs.\n\n3 days ago\n\nBristol\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
