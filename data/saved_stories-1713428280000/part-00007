The layoffs that increased throughout\n2022 crested into last year\u2014totaling 262,735 workers impacted in 2023,\naccording to layoffs.fyi. And yet, despite ongoing layoffs for many, we also\nexperienced an AI boom. 2023 was our first full year in the new AI era\u2014ChatGPT\nlaunched in earnest in November 2022\u2014and we\u2019re just starting to see how AI may\nbe integrating into business and hiring decisions.\n\nAlongside these highs and lows, we\u2019ve also experienced a notable debate about\nwhere we work, with many companies shifting away from the pandemic remote work\nnorms. 2023 was certainly a shift in how talent and tech engage with one\nanother, on many levels.\n\nWe dove into our venture capital firm\u2019s talent data to uncover what\u2019s actually\nhappening across the tech industry. We found big shake-ups in where talent is\nmoving, Gen Z's career paths, and where to find AI experts:\n\n  1. Austin is the fastest-growing city for top tech talent by percentage.\n  2. New York City is gaining the biggest share of relocating tech talent.\n  3. Silicon Valley is losing the biggest share of relocating tech talent, but is still growing in net head count.\n  4. Gen Z talent is being promoted to management slower than past generations.\n  5. Gen Z workers switch jobs 2x faster than those in Gen X.\n  6. VC-backed founders are older than a decade ago, with the oldest in sectors like life sciences and cybersecurity.\n  7. Data is maturing from an analyst- and scientist-centric role to an engineering-focused discipline.\n  8. As demand for AI talent grows, a declining percentage of AI hires have graduate degrees or prestigious schooling.\n  9. Silicon Valley still hosts the most AI talent, benefiting from the recent AI startup boom.\n\nWe close out the report with predictions for the future, and what founders\nshould do to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nOur source: We used SignalFire\u2019s own AI engine, Beacon, which we\u2019ve been\nrefining since our launch in 2013. Beacon tracks more than 600 million\nemployees and 80 million companies to guide our investing, assist portfolio\ncompanies with scaling their teams and revenue, and gather the key insights\nfor this report.\n\n## Everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, and the Big Apple is seeding new\nopportunities\n\nThe San Francisco Bay area has been the undisputed center of technology for\ndecades, and it still reigns supreme. However, the pandemic and its impact on\nremote work resulted in a diaspora for tech companies and their workers,\nrevealing a shift toward other growing tech hubs. In this section we\u2019ll share\nthe top destinations for tech worker relocations and how founders can recruit\ntop talent across the globe.\n\n### Talent trend #1: Everything\u2019s bigger in Texas\n\nAustin is rapidly emerging as a top-tier tech talent market\n\nThe old adage is true: everything really is bigger in Texas. We crunched the\nnumbers and looked at city-by-city growth at top VC-backed startups, from 2019\npre-pandemic head counts to the close of 2023. Texas claimed two of the top\nthree spots with Austin (up 23%) and Dallas (up 19%).\n\nNotably, Austin also tops the charts for growth in big tech, with a remarkable\n44% growth during this time period. Seattle claimed the number two spot with\n20% growth of employees at VC-backed startups\u2014but we can also infer a great\ndeal of that growth was not as much geo-movement as it was movement from big\ntech companies to startup opportunities, with only 6% growth in Seattle\u2019s big\ntech scene. Also notable is that the Bay Area saw immaterial startup net\ngrowth during the same period, though some of this may be characterized by a\nshift of tech workers to big tech companies, which saw 18% growth. And\nArizona, once considered a hub for tech sales workers, has shrunk by 7% over\nthe same time period.\n\n### Talent trend #2: The Big Apple gets bigger\n\nTech talent flocked to New York City from across the country\n\nOverall population trends in the post-pandemic period were largely driven by\npeople entering and leaving the tech workforce as the 2021 boom was followed\nby years of layoffs.\n\nBut once people have tech jobs, where do they prefer to live?\n\nOne way to home in on these preferences is to look at the subset of existing\ntech workers who relocated between 2022 and 2023. The data below gives the\nchange in each city\u2019s population among this moving subset, where a city\u2019s net\ngain or loss is determined by the difference between the number of people who\nmoved to that city and the number of people who moved away from it.\n\nOn this measure, NYC tops the charts, taking in nearly twice as many\nrelocators between 2022 and 2023 as runner-up Austin and claiming 15% of all\npeople who moved. The biggest losers include some of the most notable tech\nhubs, including San Francisco, Seattle, and Boston, and many posit this is due\nto the high cost of living in cities like these compared with emerging cities\nlike Austin. However, that does not properly tell the story, with New York\nCity boasting the highest rent prices in the country yet attracting the\nlargest share of relocators during this time period.\n\n### Talent trend #3: The Silicon Valley startup exodus\n\nThe Bay Area is still growing its tech head count, but it's losing talent to\nNYC and Austin\n\nThere are two key aspects to the movement away from San Francisco Bay Area\nstartups during the past five years. The first relates to a shift to big tech\nduring that time period (remaining in the Bay Area), and the second relates to\na physical relocation to tech startups in other locations.\n\nOne hypothesis for why tech workers may have shifted to big tech over the past\nfive years: the former reputation for FAANG companies and other big tech to be\na safe and secure career move compared to a fledgling startup\u2014until the\nmassive layoffs in 2022 and beyond. We postulate the trend of startup talent\nshifting from startups to big tech as a \u201csafe move\u201d is long gone and VC-funded\nstartups are in a strong position to recruit from this same talent pool.\n\nThe second aspect of this trend is the physical relocation by geolocation from\nthe Bay to places like NYC, Austin, Los Angeles, and Denver. Given the shift\nto remote work during the pandemic, we believe that the bulk of these moves\nare remote worker relocations that do not align to their employer locations in\nall cases.\n\nBy net change as a percentage of all San Francisco Bay Area relocators, the\nmost common move was to NYC, and NYC also received new residents from Seattle\nand Boston. What\u2019s clear is that cost of living doesn\u2019t purely incite these\nmoves; NYC is in the midst of a tech talent boom.\n\n#### Location hiring tips for founders\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out, consider basing your company in Austin, NYC,\nSeattle, or Dallas to take advantage of these geo-movement trends. These tech\nhubs have an influx of talent, many of whom work in big tech today but who may\nbe more open to VC-backed startups in the wake of big tech\u2019s layoff\ninstability.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to find local talent, consider entities in growing\nsecondary hubs, either as remote talent optionality or by creating a hub and\nspoke model.

When Gen X was four years into their careers, 7% of the\ngeneration had already moved upward into management positions, compared with\nonly 2.8% in Gen Z today. In this section we explore our hypotheses for why\nGen Z is less likely to become a manager compared with Gen Y or Gen X.\n\nFirst, this generation has experienced a most unsteady macroeconomic entrance\ninto the workforce, experiencing a global pandemic, The Great Resignation, and\na layoffs peak\u2014all within their first four years. The data is clear they job\nhopped at double the rate of their older generational counterparts: Gen Y on\naverage worked an average of 2.2 jobs over the first four years of their\ncareer, compared with Gen X holding on average 1.1 jobs over the first four\nyears of their careers, respectively.\n\nRegardless of job hop by choice or by layoff, it is likely that Gen Z has\nbuilt a different, more transient relationship with employers. It\u2019s possible\nthat they simply don\u2019t stay with one company long enough to reach promotion,\nor they would rather explore all of their options more fully and management\ndoesn\u2019t top that list. Another hypothesis is that Gen Z is entrepreneurially\nmotivated through side hustles or the gig economy to gain additional economic\nstreams in an unsteady full-time work environment.\n\nRegardless of the reason, what we\u2019re seeing is that fewer Gen Z workers are\ntaking the management track, and if that trend continues it could\nfundamentally create a labor shortage in management in a few decades as they\nmature into the more senior working generation.\n\n### Talent trend #5: It\u2019s an age old question, why does Gen Z change jobs more\nquickly than X or Y?\n\nGen Z's fresh graduates held twice as many different jobs in the first four\nyears after college as Gen X did\n\nAbove we explored the many reasons Gen Z isn\u2019t moving into management\npositions, and one prominent reason supported by data is the frequency at\nwhich they change jobs, regardless of the reason.\n\nThere are many reasons for job changes over the past few years, be it The\nGreat Resignation of 2021 or the layoffs of 2022 until now. Gallup and others\nhave been pointing to Millenials as the \u201cJob Hopping Generation\u201d because they\nchange jobs at a far greater rate than their predecessor generations. However,\nBeacon data surfaced from the past two years shows that Gen Z is even more\nquick to jump from one job to another.\n\nThe chart below reveals that Gen Z employees both leave jobs at an earlier\ntime interval than their older counterparts and hold more jobs within the same\ntime period.\n\nBecause most people experience their first management job as a promotion\nwithin the same company, one theory as to why Gen Z isn\u2019t moving into\nmanagement could be that they aren\u2019t staying long enough to experience\npromotions. Regardless of promotion to management or to more senior individual\ncontributor positions, this may create some stagnation in upward mobility for\nGen Z and an even greater friction in the relationship between employers and\nGen Z.\n\n### Talent trend #6: Venture-backed founders today are older than before\n\nVC-backed founders are now twice as likely to have 15\u201320 years of experience\nversus a decade ago\n\nWe are in the beginning stages of a founder boom, where the increase in\nlayoffs mixed with the increase in new technologies to build business upon\n(AI, no-code/low-code, etc.) create space for a new cohort of founders to\nstart companies.\n\nWe compared the age and years of work experience of today\u2019s cohort of venture-\nbacked founders compared to the last major generation 10 years ago and found\nthat founders are trending significantly older now. The majority of founders\nin 2013 had 10 or fewer years of experience, and today most founders have 5\u201320\nyears of work experience prior to starting their company.\n\nThis could be because of the rise in B2B SaaS businesses and the benefit of\nwork experience in founding in this sector, compared with the rise in consumer\nproducts we saw during the first 15 years of the century. It could also be\nbecause of the large-scale numbers of experienced tech workers laid off in the\npast two years who founded a company when they didn\u2019t find another role. It\ncould also be because experienced founders are returning to found another\ncompany in the wake of AI. No matter the reason, the youngest generation of\nworkers (those with less than five years of experience) aren\u2019t founding\nventure-backed companies at nearly the rate their older counterparts did a\ndecade ago\u2014generational differences abound between the actions of Gen Z and\nearlier generations.\n\n#### Generational hiring tips for founders\n\nFounders should anticipate the needs of the Gen Z workforce in order to retain\nthem beyond the first year. One systemic way to do this is to create clear\ncareer pathways for the individual contributor talent track to incrementally\nadvance their career within your company so they see progressive advancement\nover time, regardless of aspirations for management. Additionally, founders\nshould consider implementing a 10% time program to spark innovation and\nfreedom and keep Gen Z excited about ways to contribute to the company outside\nof their normal job duties.\n\nAnd a pitch for the older generations: founders should also consider hiring\nmore diversity by age. Research shows that older workers increase your total\ntalent pool and create more productive businesses, and older workers are more\nlikely to be loyal to your company for a longer period of time.\n\n## Spotlight on AI: The data is in\n\n### Talent trend #7: Data engineering is on the rise\n\nData engineer has eclipsed data analyst as the top data-related role\n\nHeadlines abound about advances in AI technology\u2014but there should be a\nsubheader that underscores the critical role data plays in the equation. Data\nengineers in particular are vital for AI's advancement, focusing on\ncollecting, cleaning, and preparing vast amounts of data necessary for AI\nmodels.\n\nHistorically the remit for data scientists has been much broader than pure\ndata science, and as the role that data plays in technology advances, we\u2019re\nseeing more specialization across data organizations. It\u2019s clear that data\nengineers are the in-demand growth role of 2023. While data scientists peaked\nin 2018 and are sloping downward, we believe that it\u2019s less about the\nimportance of data science and more that their remit has been honed in on the\ntrue craft they are trained for alongside more developed data teams.\n\n### Talent trend #8: AI-vy League > Ivy League\n\nThe highest concentration of AI talent is now at top startups, not tech giants\nand prestigious universities\n\nMany companies looking for AI/ML talent typically list requirements for top-\ntier CS programs at the graduate level, but this is simply not the reality\nwhen considering who is actually hired. Even amongst scientists and\nresearchers, less than half of all hires have a graduate degree, and only\nabout a third of ML engineers have a graduate degree at all, let alone a PhD.\n\nIn fact, the top AI talent is concentrated (with and without degrees) at a set\nof nine AI companies SignalFire has coined the AI-vy League. Companies should\nthink twice before making graduate degrees requisite for their open roles;\nthis can detract from the applicant pool of qualified individuals and have\nadverse consequences for diversity and equity efforts.\n\n### Talent trend #9: Silicon Valley still wins for AI talent\n\nA new gold rush of AI startups is reinvigorating the San Francisco Bay Area\n\nWhile there has been an exodus from Silicon Valley for tech workers over the\npast five years, it is still number one when it comes to volume of AI talent.\nNYC may be stealing tech talent more broadly from the West coast, but it has a\nlong way to go in order to catch up to the sheer volume boasted by the SF Bay\nArea and San Jose, California.\n\nInterestingly, there is also a high concentration of this talent in places\nfounders might not expect: from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Portland, Oregon,\ncompanies can find relevant AI talent for their open roles without competing\nwith major tech hubs.\n\n#### AI hiring tips for founders\n\nWhile the supply and demand mix mostly favors employers in this current jobs\nclimate, AI talent is the exception and is in extremely high demand. Companies\nthat can hire remotely should consider alternative locations and flexible\nworking conditions to attract top AI/ML talent from the other concentrated\ncities listed above. Additionally, staffing the team properly so a data\nscientist can be 100% data scientist and ML engineer can be 100% ML\nengineer\u2014compared with covering for other teams with an expansive generic\nengineering remit\u2014will go a long way.\n\nAlso, your best talent might already be on your team. Companies like Modal\nLearning give existing teams the skills to advance to becoming data engineers\nand data scientists, so companies not only gain these critical capabilities\nwithout hiring externally but also nurture the career growth of their\nemployees.\n\n## Future predictions\n\n### The emergence of new job categories\n\nA lot of headlines today ponder whether AI will displace workers, and the\nreality for most skilled workers is that it won\u2019t displace a job but it will\nevolve it. With AI being integrated into many enterprise-ready workplace tools\nfor productivity, collaboration, and more, the bigger question is what new\njobs will emerge as a result of AI? I believe we will see a shift into\nsubspecialties similar to the data shift we explored previously in this\nreport, only with the security function. Today, there are CISOs and security\nleaders whose remit is very broad, and given the myriad cybersecurity dynamics\nthat stem from AI\u2019s powerful capabilities, I predict we\u2019ll see new\nsubspecialties emerge within security teams and much more intentional hiring\nin this functional arena, similar to the way data exploded over the past five\nyears.\n\nFounder tip: Organizational design isn\u2019t only about org charts, it\u2019s the art\nand science of designing organizations that can make decisions and execute\neffectively. Do you have the right roles organized in the right ways to help\nyour organization drive key results forward? Check out our People Fundamentals\nguide, which highlights tips for organizational design and more people\nfundamentals to get right within your company (especially if you don\u2019t have an\nHR leader yet).\n\n### Remote work will rise again\n\nIn this economy, where there is a surplus of talent impacted by layoffs, the\nReturn to Office movement will continue to gain ground with the upper hand in\nhiring, but as the tides turn back to a candidate-centric market in future\nyears, those companies that have built flexible foundations to support remote\nwork will have a long-term upper hand.\n\nFounder tip: Build remote-ready companies to be successful in any workplace\nmodality. Consider SignalFire\u2019s WFH FAQ guide to strengthen the remote aspects\nof your workplace (even if it\u2019s just what happens when someone WFH for a one-\noff) so that, should you need to shift strategies to attract talent in 2025\nand beyond, you\u2019re ready.\n\n### Fractional is the future\n\nMuch of the layoffs of 2022 and 2023 stem from an overhiring response to the\nGreat Resignation of 2021. Companies are getting wise to the fact that\nworkforce needs come and go, and the pivot from fast hiring to fast firing is\npainful. Moreover, Gen Z has completely different views on the relationship\nbetween workplace and worker than their peers of previous generations, and the\ndynamic and transient nature of consulting and fractional work is an appealing\nconstruct. There will be an increase in fractional and consulting work for key\nroles in companies during this period of economic uncertainty for startups,\nand we believe that fractional and temporary work is here to stay.\n\nFounder tip: Build a hiring plan to better forecast full-time hiring needs and\nget clear on when temporary or fractional work suffices.\n\n### About SignalFire\n\nSignalFire is the first venture capital firm built like a technology company\nto better solve for the needs of founders.
