The big tech and big oil pairing will\nwork closely during their multi-year collaboration to \"develop and certify\nnext-generation, energy-efficient, liquid-based cooling technologies\" writes\nExxonMobil in the press release. Intel wants significant improvements in order\nto cool future Xeon CPUs with up to 2,000 watts TDPs, which are scheduled to\nappear between now and 2030.\n\nExxonMobil is best known as an oil company, but it's also one of the largest\nchemical businesses worldwide. One of its perhaps surprising strengths is in\nproviding advanced fluids for liquid immersion cooling solutions. It makes\nvarious PFAS-free immersion cooling products offering different grades,\nviscosities, and flash points.\n\nIn the press release, ExxonMobil says it hopes the new collaboration will aid\nthe industry\u2019s transition to liquid cooling. A canned statement from Intel\nechoes those hopes and explains that turnkey solutions for liquid cooling that\nprovide \"significant energy and water savings\" are among the goals of the\npartnership.\n\nExxonMobil makes some bold claims for its immersion cooling fluids. Its\ndielectric fluids are said to offer superior thermal management while\nincreasing hardware lifespan and lowering costs. The trio of properties\nhighlighted seem handpicked to appeal to data center operators. Sustainability\nis also stressed, with ExxonMobil pointing to reduced energy use (measured by\nPower Usage Effectiveness (PUE)), reduced water consumption, and increased\nrack density.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIt looks like ExxonMobil has the fluid side of things sewn up, so Intel just\nneeds to work on the turnkey immersion cooling tanks and chassis. We've\npreviously reported on Intel\u2019s liquid and immersion cooling investments and\nprojects. In May 2022 we noted that the firm would invest $700 million to\ndesign next-generation immersion liquid cooling solutions. Last year we\nreported on Intel researchers creating immersion cooling systems leveraging\nintriguing technology such as \"3D vapor chambers embedded in coral-shaped heat\nsinks.\" Similarly, we heard it was testing out \"tiny jets, adjusted by\nartificial intelligence, that shoot cool water over hot spots in the chip to\nremove heat.\"\n\nIn short, Intel seems to have plenty of ideas that could complement the use of\nExxonMobil's best fluids. There's no clear timeline of when the partnership\nwill finalize the hardware and liquid side of things, but presumably Intel\nwants the solution to be ready for the 2,000W TDP Xeons it showed on roadmaps\nat February\u2019s IFS Direct Connect event.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

It's a\nbig win when big data center can heat a small town in some place like Iceland\n:)\n\nReply\n\n  * thestryker\n\n> JTWrenn said:\n>\n> We need to lower power usage from datacenters and instead they are just\n> working on how to handle higher power usage.

Think of it this way\nif a 2P 2000W CPU based server can replace at least 6x 2P 350W CPU based\nservers there is going to be a large amount of power savings. Immersion\ncooling is usually more efficient than liquid or air as well so if they can\nget a non-PFAS based system working that should be more power savings.\n\nReply\n\n  * dalek1234\n\n2000 Watts? So instead of making CPUs more energy efficient (something Intel\nis seriously lacing in and doesn't have much of a future as a company without\ndoing so), they are preparing for CPUs that suck up even more power. Does that\nmean they gave up on making their CPUs considerably more power-efficient? Kind\nof sounds like it to me.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nRaspberry Pi Compute Module 4S memory variants announced\n\nTSMC's labor practices draw serious concern in Arizona \u2014 the company's new\nchip plant allegedly plagued by worker abuses\n\nFormer EKWB Employees say company has racist, hostile work environment,\nwithholds overtime pay\n\nGigabyte confirms Ryzen 9000 branding for Zen 5 processors, preps beta BIOS\nupdates for 500-series motherboards\n\nWindows 11 update brings advertisements to the start menu\n\nQualcomm announces Snapdragon X Plus \u2013 10-cores is less than X Elite, but the\nsame 45 TOPS from the NPU\n\nBambu Lab Printer Firmware Updates Have Limited Timeline\n\nMicrosoft blocks some PCs from Windows 11 24H2 \u2014 CPU must support SSE4.2 or\nthe OS will not boot\n\nIntel CPU-dispensing vending machine game spotted in Japan \u2014 one user got a\nCore i7-8700 for $3\n\nNewegg offers free membership program to boost signups \u2014 includes free\nshipping and special deals\n\nAMD rumored to use 'slow' 18Gbps GDDR6 in RDNA 4 \u2014 leaker says Team Red's next\ngeneration GPUs won't use GDDR7\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
