We are more similar than we are different,\" said biologist\nDr Isabella Laumer at the Max Planck institute in Germany and lead author of\nthe research.\n\nA research team in the Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia spotted Rakus\nwith a large wound on his cheek in June 2022.\n\nThey believe he was injured fighting with rival male orangutans because he\nmade loud cries called \"long calls\" in the days before they saw the wound.\n\nThe team then saw Rakus chewing the stem and leaves of plant called Akar\nKuning - an anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial plant that is also used\nlocally to treat malaria and diabetes.\n\nArmas\n\nScientists saw Rakus chewing a medicinal leaf into a paste\n\nHe repeatedly applied the liquid onto his cheek for seven minutes. Rakus then\nsmeared the chewed leaves onto his wound until it was fully covered. He\ncontinued to feed on the plant for over 30 minutes.\n\nThe paste and leaves then appear to have done their magic - the researchers\nsaw no sign of infection and the wound closed within five days.\n\nAfter a month, Rakus was fully healed.\n\nSafruddin\n\nAfter a month, the wound on Rakus's cheek was healed\n\nThe scientists concluded that Rakus knew he was applying medicine because\norangutans very rarely eat this particular plant and because of the length of\nthe treatment.\n\n\"He repeatedly applied the paste, and he later also applied more solid plant\nmatter. The entire process lasted really a considerable amount of time -\nthat's why we think that he intentionally applied it,\" explains Dr Laumer.\n\nThe researchers also saw Rakus resting for much longer than usual - more than\nhalf of the day - suggesting he was trying to recuperate after the injury.\n\nScientists were already aware that great apes used medicine to try to heal\nthemselves.\n\nIn the 1960s biologist Jane Goodall saw whole leaves in the faeces of\nchimpanzees, and others documented seeing great apes swallowing leaves with\nmedicinal properties.\n\nBut they had never seen a wild animal applying a plant to a wound.\n\nDr Laumer says it is possible that it was the first time Rakus had done this\ntype of treatment.\n\n\"It could be that he accidentally touched his wound with his finger that had\nthe plant on it. And then because the plant has quite potent pain relieving\nsubstances he might have felt immediate pain relief, which made him apply it\nagain and again,\" she says.\n\nOr he could have learned the method from watching other orangutans in his\ngroup.\n\nThe researchers will now be closely watching other orangutans to see if they\ncan spot the same medical skills that Rakus showed.\n\n\"I think in the next few years we will discover even more behaviours and more\nabilities that are very human-like,\" she suggests.\n\nThe research is published in the scientific journal Scientific Reports.\n\nOrangutans\n\nRelated\n\n## Zoo's orangutans 'intrigued' by roof repairs\n\n18 Apr 2024\n\nEssex\n\n## Zoo's orangutan enclosure shut after storm damage\n\n16 Apr 2024\n\nEssex\n\n## 'Iconic figure' Sibu the orangutan dies\n\n1 Mar 2024\n\nEurope\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": true}
