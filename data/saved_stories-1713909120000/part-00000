By comparison, most AI systems up until\nrecently have been air-cooled.\n\nAs we saw at GTC, this trend could soon change. While Nvidia's HGX B100 and\nHGX B200 systems will still be available in air-cooled form factors, its most\npowerful accelerators like the 2,700-watt Grace-Blackwell Superchip will\nrequire liquid cooling.\n\nDespite the hype, adding AI capabilities was far from enterprises' highest\npriority, with roughly 58 percent of respondents saying improving facility\nsecurity was their biggest pain point, followed by reducing energy\nconsumption, increasing utilization of existing hardware, and acquiring higher\nperformance systems all ranking above AI capabilities at 27 percent.\n\nLiquid cooling isn't limited to AI and HPC systems. It also happens to be much\nmore efficient at removing waste heat than air. As we've previously discussed,\n15-20 percent of power consumption can be directly attributed to the fans used\nto move air through these systems. Transitioning to liquid cooling, depending\non the technology involved, largely eliminates the need for high RPM fans,\nreducing power consumption considerably.\n\nCombined with the opportunistic boost algorithms found on most modern\nprocessors, liquid-cooled systems should in theory be capable of achieving\nhigher clock speeds than their air-cooled siblings.\n\n### Enterprises still undecided on direct to chip vs immersion cooling\n\nDespite the advantages liquid cooling offers, readers remain split as to which\nversion of technology they will ultimately deploy.\n\nBy 2026 more than a third of respondents expect to employ some form of liquid\ncooling in their datacenters \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nBy 2026, 16.3 percent said they were going all in on direct-to-chip (DTC)\nliquid cooling, which replaces heat sinks with cool plates through which warm\nor chilled water or coolants are pumped. By comparison, 6.5 percent said they\nplanned to go 100 percent immersion cooling. This technology involves\nsubmerging the entire system in either single-phase fluids like synthetic\noils, or two-phase fluids engineered to boil at or around the chips' operating\ntemperature.\n\nAbout a sixth of respondents said they planned to use a mix of DTC and\nimmersion cooling in their datacenters, while 61.7 percent said they had no\nplan to utilize either technology in the next two years.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the largest enterprises expect to adopt liquid cooling the\nfastest. This could be down to a couple of factors, ranging from larger\nbudgets for AI deployments or limited datacenter space necessitating denser\nrack configurations.\n\n### Most enterprises probably don't need liquid cooling just yet\n\nThe majority of those surveyed have rack power densities below what is\ngenerally considered necessary for liquid cooling \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nSpeaking of current rack power trends, it's not hard to see why so many\nenterprises are sticking with air cooling in the near term. About 87 percent\nof respondents reported rack densities of 50 kW of lower. That's the upper end\nof what Digital Realty CTO Chris Sharp told our sibling site The Next Platform\nits facilities could support without resorting to rear-door heat exchangers\n(RDHx) or DTC cooling.\n\nPractically speaking, we tend to see RDHx \u2013 essentially rack-sized radiators\nused to chill hot air exiting servers down to acceptable levels \u2013 used in\nracks exceeding around 40 kW. For reference, that's roughly the load expected\nfor a stack of four DGX H100 systems.\n\nJust 6.7 percent of respondents said their average rack power was between 51\nkW and 100 kW a rack, while 6.3 percent said it exceeded 100 kW. We've seen\nsome larger RDHx systems that can handle air-cooled systems up to around 90 kW\nof thermal dissipation.\n\nThe survey found that as enterprises grow larger they trend toward denser rack\nconfigurations \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nHere, again, there aren't many surprises with enterprises trending toward\nhigher rack densities the larger they get.\n\n  * Supermicro CEO predicts 20 percent of datacenters will adopt liquid cooling\n  * Liquid cooling specialist snags Microsoft datacenter wizard as advisor\n  * What Nvidia's Blackwell efficiency gains mean for DC operators\n  * How thermal management is changing in the age of the kilowatt chip\n\n### Cost and reliability remain key concerns\n\nBut while readers expect to deploy liquid cooling more broadly across their\ninfrastructure over the next few years, there remain challenges and concerns\nregarding adoption.\n\nMaintenance and complexity followed by the cost of implementation were two of\nbiggest barriers to adoption for liquid cooling cited by survey respondents \u2013\nclick to enlarge\n\nAmong their top concerns were maintenance, complexity, and the initial cost of\nimplementation. Liquid-cooled systems require additional resources, facility\nwater, CDUs, and in the case of DTC, rack manifolds to distribute the coolant\nto the individual systems.\n\nExisting datacenters can be retrofitted to support liquid cooling using in-\naisle coolant reservoirs and liquid-to-air CDUs. However, the cooling capacity\nis generally lower with these kinds of approaches.\n\nFollowing cost and complexity, 48.6 percent of respondents cited a lack of\nexperience with the technology, and 41 percent expressed fears over leaks and\nspills. Finally, 21.4 percent said the cost of buying and replacing coolant as\na potential challenge.\n\nWhile liquid cooling does introduce additional complexity and points of\nfailure, the technology is by no means new, having been used for decades in\nsupercomputers, HPC-centric clusters and render farms, and more recently\nlarge-scale GPU and accelerator farms for training generative AI.\n\nIncreased interest in liquid cooling has given rise to preventative measures\nlike negative pressure coolant loops designed to minimize spills in the case\nof a leak, and in rack CDUs with redundant or modular pumps. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Datacenter\n  * Immersion cooling\n  * Liquid cooling\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Datacenter\n  * Immersion cooling\n  * Liquid cooling\n  * Server\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Disaster recovery\n  * Home lab\n  * Open Compute Project\n  * PUE\n  * Software defined data center\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Data Centre\n\n#### More about\n\n2 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Datacenter\n  * Immersion cooling\n  * Liquid cooling\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Datacenter\n  * Immersion cooling\n  * Liquid cooling\n  * Server\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Disaster recovery\n  * Home lab\n  * Open Compute Project\n  * PUE\n  * Software defined data center\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Data Centre\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Liquid cooling specialist snags Microsoft datacenter wizard as advisor\n\nIceotope will need the help as it navigates the frosty waters of global\nexpansion\n\nOn-Prem18 days | 2\n\n#### Digital Realty wants to turn Irish datacenters into grid-stabilizing\npower jugglers\n\nElectricity goes both ways as bit barns in Dublin aim to cut emissions and\nboost the bank\n\nOn-Prem2 hrs | 4\n\n#### AI energy draw from Chicago datacenters to rise ninefold\n\nNo wonder industry is exploring nuclear as an alternative to electricity\n\nOn-Prem4 days | 16\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### HPE sues China's Inspur Group over server patents\n\nMiddle Kingdom biz accused of IP theft and changing names to evade sanctions\n\nSystems6 days | 1\n\n#### Blackstone wants to plug hyperscale datacenter into former Britishvolt\nbattery site\n\nPlans to plant $12B bitbarn where homegrown renewables hope once lived\n\nOn-Prem7 days | 49\n\n#### Microsoft aims to triple datacenter capacity to fuel AI boom\n\nAnd it's far from the only hyperscaler getting in on the act\n\nOn-Prem5 days | 2\n\n#### AI cloud startup TensorWave bets AMD can beat Nvidia\n\nStarts racking MI300X systems - because you can actually buy them and they\nbeat the H100 on many specs\n\nSystems7 days | 4\n\n#### Digital Realty ditches diesel for salad dressing in US to cut datacenter\nemissions\n\nHydrotreated vegetable oil to power bit barns stateside after successful Euro\ntrial\n\nSystems12 days | 15\n\n#### RISC-V AI chip upstart Rivos plans to undercut Nvidia, helped by a\nquarter-billion in VC lucre\n\nWith Apple lawsuit behind it, focussed on finalizing its designs\n\nOn-Prem7 days |\n\n#### OpenAI CEO wants UAE into his plan for a global AI cabal\n\nAsking for emir few billion bucks to pay for lots of fabs, datacenters, and\nnuclear power plants\n\nAI + ML12 days | 7\n\n#### Dell shaves months off lead times for GPU-powered AI servers\n\nTSMC turns advanced packaging production knob to 11\n\nHPC12 days | 2\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
