Macdonald was a\nfigure at the institutional heart of British philosophy in the mid-20th\ncentury whose work, especially her views on the nature of philosophy itself,\ndeserves to be better known.\n\nEarly proponents of the \u2018analytic\u2019 method in philosophy such as Bertrand\nRussell saw good philosophy as science-like and were dismissive of philosophy\nthat was overly poetic or unscientific. Russell, for example, took issue with\nthe French philosopher Henri Bergson, who was something of a b\u00eate-noire for\nearly analytic philosophers. Bergson\u2019s theorising (Russell thought) did not\ndepend on argument but rather on expressing \u2018truths\u2019, so-called, arrived at by\nintrospection. As Russell wrote in \u2018The Philosophy of Bergson\u2019 (1912):\n\n> His imaginative picture of the world, regarded as a poetic effort, is in the\n> main not capable of either proof or disproof. Shakespeare says life\u2019s but a\n> walking shadow, Shelley says it is like a dome of many-colored glass,\n> Bergson says it is a shell which burst into parts that are again shells. If\n> you like Bergson\u2019s image better, it is just as legitimate.\n\nRussell places Bergson alongside William Shakespeare and Percy Bysshe Shelley\nand worries that there is no objective measure of whose worldview is more\naccurate. There\u2019s no way of proving which is a better account of things, it\u2019s\nsimply a matter of which \u2018image\u2019 you like best. In other words, there\u2019s no\nattempt to provide empirical evidence \u2013 evidence based on publicly observable\ndata \u2013 in support of these views. For Russell, this was enough to show that\nwhat Bergson was doing was not really philosophy, at least not good\nphilosophy, any more than Shakespeare\u2019s plays and Shelley\u2019s poetry were.\n\nRussell\u2019s view of what counts as good philosophy was not one that Macdonald\nshared. In her 1953 paper, she embraces comparisons between philosophy and\nliterature, poetry and art. For Macdonald, philosophical theories are very\nmuch like \u2018pictures\u2019 or \u2018stories\u2019 and, perhaps even more controversially, she\nsuggests that philosophical debates often come down to \u2018temperamental\ndifferences\u2019. For example, whether you are willing to believe (in accordance\nwith thinkers like Ren\u00e9 Descartes) that we have an immaterial soul will come\ndown to more than just the philosophical arguments you are presented with.\nYour view on this matter, Macdonald thinks, will more likely be determined by\nyour own personal values, life experiences, religion and so on. In this way,\nshe thinks, temperamental differences account for many philosophical\ndisagreements.\n\nHowever, unlike Bergson, Macdonald was not working in a different\nphilosophical tradition from Russell. She was, to all appearances at least,\njust as much a part of analytic philosophy as he was. In fact,\ninstitutionally, she was at the very centre of things. Macdonald studied at\nthe University of London and her PhD was supervised by Susan Stebbing, the\nfirst woman in Britain to be appointed a full professor of philosophy. Along\nwith Stebbing and others including Gilbert Ryle, Macdonald helped found\nAnalysis \u2013 the academic journal of analytic philosophy \u2013 which she later\nedited after the Second World War. And throughout the 1930s and \u201950s, she\npublished many articles in venues like the Proceedings of the Aristotelian\nSociety, the UK\u2019s foremost philosophical society, and was an active member of\nCambridge University\u2019s Moral Sciences Club.\n\nSo what happened? How did Macdonald end up with such a different view about\nwhat good philosophy looks like from Russell\u2019s? And, if Macdonald was right,\nwhat does that imply about the value of philosophy?\n\nThe story of Macdonald\u2019s entry into philosophy is quite remarkable. She was\nborn in 1903 into poverty to a single mother who later absconded to Australia,\nleaving her baby behind to be fostered. Macdonald was ill throughout her\nchildhood and youth, suffering from tuberculosis (among other things), and\nsupported by an organisation called the National Children\u2019s Home and Orphanage\nthat later helped pay for her undergraduate studies. As Michael Kremer notes,\nMacdonald\u2019s upbringing stands in stark contrast with many of the canonical\nfigures in 20th-century philosophy such as Russell, who was born into British\naristocracy (his grandfather was an earl who was twice prime minister), Ludwig\nWittgenstein, a member of what was, historically, an extremely wealthy family\n(his father Karl, an industrialist, was one of the richest men in Europe), or\nRyle, who spent his entire adult life easily moving through the ranks at the\nUniversity of Oxford.\n\nStebbing was an important figure in Macdonald\u2019s life, both personally and\nprofessionally. Macdonald was one of a number of women who benefitted from\nStebbing\u2019s supervision, along with Ruth Lydia Saw and Elsie Whetnall, and\nwould go on to teach at Bedford College (now part of Royal Holloway,\nUniversity of London) where Stebbing was professor of philosophy.\n\nIt was not easy for women to establish themselves in philosophy at this time\nand many women\u2019s careers were negatively impacted by sexism (Oxford didn\u2019t\nbestow degrees to women until 1920, and at the University of Cambridge it even\nlater: 1948). When she applied for G E Moore\u2019s Chair in Cambridge in 1938,\nStebbing, for example, was told by Ryle that \u2018everyone thinks you are the\nright person to succeed Moore, except that you are a woman\u2019. Blunt to say the\nleast. Similarly, in a letter to a friend in 1939, Macdonald writes: \u2018I have\nbeen hoping to get a permanent lectureship in philosophy ... It is difficult\nin my subject, especially for a woman.\u2019 Nonetheless, through a pipeline from\nBedford College into academic philosophy (and often back to Bedford College),\nStebbing was able to help several women establish themselves in the\nprofession.\n\nShe subjects philosophical enquiry itself to scrutiny, analysing the ways that\nphilosophers talk and write\n\nIt is also likely that Stebbing had a hand in pushing Macdonald to focus on\nthe relationship between philosophy and language. In Thinking to Some Purpose\n(1939), Stebbing emphasises the importance of distinguishing between different\nuses of language \u2013 eg, the difference between descriptive and emotive language\n\u2013 not only in philosophy, but in public discourse such as politics and\njournalism. After working with Stebbing, Macdonald went to Cambridge to work\non a project on the influence of language on the concept of \u2018matter\u2019, a topic\non which Stebbing herself once planned to write a book.\n\nSoon after arriving in Cambridge in the 1930s, Macdonald met Wittgenstein, a\ntowering figure in 20th-century philosophy. Along with Alice Ambrose,\nMacdonald attended many of his lectures \u2013 and the two women would go on to\npublish the so-called Blue and Brown Books, collated from notes they took\nbetween 1932-1935. It is no coincidence that, from the late 1930s onwards,\nMacdonald\u2019s work often draws on what is known as \u2018linguistic analysis\u2019 \u2013 which\nis an approach to philosophy rather than a specific theory. Linguistic\nanalysis was central to Wittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy (and important in\nAmbrose\u2019s philosophy, too).\n\nLinguistic analysis involves paying attention to and drawing conclusions from\nthe language used in particular contexts, including philosophical debates,\nscientific theories, and ordinary (common-sense) language. In her essay\n\u2018Linguistic Philosophy and Perception\u2019, Macdonald subjects philosophical\nenquiry itself to scrutiny, analysing the sorts of ways that philosophers talk\nand write \u2013 especially in comparison with scientists. This kind of linguistic\nanalysis is a way of taking a step back and taking a look at the practice of\nphilosophy itself. It involves answering questions like: What do philosophical\ndisagreements involve and what do philosophical theories look like?\n\nIn a sense, then, Macdonald\u2019s aims can be thought of as anthropological: she\nis interested in making observations about what a particular subsection of\nsociety \u2013 philosophers \u2013 are doing and providing a description of their\nactivities. Macdonald takes philosophers of perception as her case study\n(hence the paper\u2019s title) and, by paying attention to the language they use,\noffers an account of what philosophy of perception really amounts to.\nAlthough, as we will see, her findings stretch beyond just philosophy of\nperception, they include the nature of philosophy itself.\n\nPutting the tools of linguistic analysis to work, Macdonald focuses her\nattention on the word \u2018theory\u2019. What do philosophers mean when they talk about\nphilosophical \u2018theories\u2019? And is it the same thing that scientists mean when\nthey use the word \u2018theory\u2019? Macdonald\u2019s answer is a categorical \u2018No\u2019.\n\nShe claims that, when scientists put forward theories, they do so to explain\nempirical facts. Scientists put forward hypotheses (eg, \u2018Earth is round\u2019 or\n\u2018physical objects are governed by laws of gravity\u2019), which can then be\nverified (or falsified) by experiments and observations, leaving behind only\nplausible theories, and eliminating those that are refuted by factual\nevidence. Thus, Macdonald writes: \u2018Confirmation and refutation by fact is an\nessential part of the meaning of \u201ctheory\u201d in its empirical sense.\u2019\n\nIf \u2018confirmation and refutation by fact\u2019 based on experiments is essential to\nthe way that the word \u2018theory\u2019 is used by scientists, that provides a basis on\nwhich to examine whether philosophers use the word \u2018theory\u2019 in that way. And\nthis is where Macdonald thinks philosophical theories differ from what\nscientists mean by the term:\n\n> They cannot be tested. Every philosophical theory of perception is\n> compatible with all perceptual facts.\n\nAccording to Macdonald, philosophical theories cannot be tested. Is that true?\nWhat might she mean by this? Once again, she uses the philosophy of perception\nas her example.\n\nPhilosophical theories, unlike scientific theories, are not in the business of\ndiscovering new facts\n\nTwo opposing positions in the philosophy of perception are direct realism and\nindirect realism (I\u2019m going to oversimplify both here). Direct realism is the\nview that we directly perceive external objects in the world around us. When I\nlook out of my window, I directly see a tree \u2013 and the nature of my perceptual\nexperience informs me (directly) about the nature of the tree. Indirect\nrealism, on the other hand, is the view that I only ever indirectly perceive\nobjects like trees. What I directly perceive are mental representations \u2013 ie,\nideas of trees \u2013 that are produced in my mind when my sense organs (eg, my\neyes) are stimulated in the right way and send signals to my brain. I learn\nabout the world around via these ideas (also known as \u2018sense data\u2019) in my\nmind. Direct realism might seem more common-sensical, but indirect realism\nmight seem better equipped to deal with the existence of illusory or\nhallucinatory experiences, where I am seemingly not perceiving the world the\nway it really is. Given all this, isn\u2019t it true to say that direct realists\nand indirect realists disagree on the facts?\n\nIn a sense, yes. But Macdonald\u2019s point is that there is no disagreement on the\nphenomenological facts: facts about what it is like to have a perceptual\nexperience. Both the direct realist and the indirect realist agree that, when\nI look out my window, I see a tree. What they disagree on is what it means to\nsay that \u2018I see a tree\u2019 \u2013 they disagree on the mechanics of what is going on,\nor how best to explain the fact that I see a tree. Most importantly, for\nMacdonald, there\u2019s no empirical test available to draw a line between the two\ntheories. We can\u2019t run an experiment to test for the truth of either theory\nbecause, on the level of experience, both parties agree that it\u2019s true to say:\n\u2018I see a tree.\u2019\n\nThus, the first step in Macdonald\u2019s meta-philosophical argument is to show\nthat philosophical theories are not \u2018theories\u2019 in a scientific sense since\nthey lack the essential criterion of being confirmed or refuted by fact. For\nthis reason, she argues, philosophical theories, unlike scientific theories,\nare not in the business of discovering new facts.\n\nSo what is it that philosophical theories do? Macdonald\u2019s answer is: \u2018What\nthey do suggest are new forms of expression for familiar facts.\u2019\n\nAt this point, Macdonald\u2019s analysis of the value of philosophy takes a turn\nthat would have made Russell \u2013 who tried to move philosophy as far away from\nthe arts as possible \u2013 very uncomfortable. Macdonald claims that philosophy\u2019s\nvalue is much closer to that of art, literature or poetry than science. She\nexplains that the arts inform us that \u2018Language has many uses besides that of\ngiving factual information or drawing deductive conclusions.\u2019 A philosophical\ntheory may not provide \u2018information in a scientific sense\u2019, she writes, \u2018but,\nas poetry shows, it is far from worthless.\u2019\n\nBy this point in her career, Macdonald had engaged extensively with the\nphilosophy of art, the philosophy of art criticism, and the philosophy of\nfiction. Her meta-philosophical claims in \u2018Linguistic Philosophy and\nPerception\u2019 indicate that her engagement with the arts gave her an acute sense\nof where their value lies. What\u2019s more, she evidently came to believe that the\nvalue of philosophy is very similar.\n\nA good work of poetry, art or literature, Macdonald explains, can \u2018enlarge\u2019\ncertain aspects of human life to help us see and think about them differently.\nFor example, Shakespeare\u2019s Othello encourages us to think about jealousy by\nmaking it the centrepiece of the play. Or consider the emphasis on humanity\u2019s\nrelationship with nature in Romantic poetry. In both cases, the artist has\n\u2018zoomed in\u2019 on, or \u2018enlarged\u2019, an aspect of life \u2013 in a way that it is not\ntypically enlarged in real life \u2013 to encourage the audience to reflect on it.\n\nHers is a 180-degree turn away from the \u2018scientistic\u2019 account of good\nphilosophy Russell endorsed\n\nMacdonald\u2019s claim is that philosophical theories act in a similar way \u2013\ndifferent theories \u2018enlarge\u2019 certain aspects of experience. And this, in turn,\nmeans that the proponents of those theories end up telling competing stories.\nSome philosophers, like Plato, emphasise the degree to which our senses\ndeceive us. Others, like Aristotle, emphasise the degree to which sense-\nexperience is key to knowledge. Again, Plato and Aristotle did not disagree on\nthe facts of experience \u2013 both agree that when I look out the window, I see a\ntree. But they disagree about the kind of story we ought to tell about those\nfacts. In Plato\u2019s story, the senses are the villains. In Aristotle\u2019s, they are\nthe heroes. Thus, Macdonald writes:\n\n> Everyone, it is sometimes said, is born either a little platonist or a\n> little aristotelian. Whatever be the truth of this aphorism has little to do\n> with the truth and falsity of these doctrines. It refers rather to\n> temperamental differences.\n\nWhat we find in Macdonald\u2019s meta-philosophy, then, is a 180-degree turn away\nfrom the \u2018scientistic\u2019 account of good philosophy that Russell endorsed.\nRussell worried that choosing between Shakespeare, Shelley or Bergson might\nturn out to be simply a matter of individual preference, that there would be\nno criterion for showing that one was a better thinker than another. But\nMacdonald\u2019s claim is that this is true of any philosophical theory \u2013 different\nstories will suit different temperaments.\n\nAt this point, one might think: enough is enough. It\u2019s all very well to\nconsider how philosophy overlaps with the arts, but surely Macdonald has gone\ntoo far when she suggests that philosophical theories are just \u2018good stories\u2019.\nMore formally, one might worry that Macdonald\u2019s account of philosophical\ndebate generates a problem of relativism.\n\nIf philosophical debates come down to \u2018temperamental differences\u2019, then it\nlooks like there\u2019s no real right or wrong (or true or false) \u2013 any more than\nit\u2019s right or wrong to prefer John Keats to Shelley, or Sally Rooney to James\nJoyce. Macdonald herself articulates the concern like so: \u2018Ought not\nphilosophy to be impersonal, unemotional and strictly rational?\u2019\n\nThis leaves Macdonald with two options. The first is to bite the bullet and\naccept that, since artistic judgments are relativistic, and philosophy is like\nthe arts, then philosophical preferences must be relativistic too. But there\nis another response available to Macdonald that does not involve accepting the\ncharge of relativism. Note that the line of reasoning above depends upon a\ncrucial assumption: that artistic judgments are relativistic.\n\nIs this really true? Are judgments about art, literature and poetry purely a\nmatter of subjective preferences? Some might be tempted to answer \u2018Yes\u2019. If I\nlike my child\u2019s hand painting more than a piece hanging in Tate Modern, I\nmight be inclined to say that, for me, it is a better piece of art. Similarly,\nif I get more enjoyment reading Rooney\u2019s novel Normal People than Joyce\u2019s\nUlysses, then who\u2019s to say that Joyce is a better writer.\n\nFor Macdonald, the job of a moral philosopher is akin to that of an art critic\n\nHowever, elsewhere in her writing \u2013 eg, her essay \u2018Natural Rights\u2019(1947) \u2013\nMacdonald endorses the view that, while artistic judgments cannot be\nempirically tested \u2013 and thus \u2018falsified\u2019 or \u2018verified\u2019 like scientific\nhypotheses \u2013 they can be defended and justified. An art critic can justify\ntheir judgment that one piece of art is better than another. And they can\npersuade others to agree with them, and minds can be changed. In that sense,\nMacdonald suggests, a critic is like a barrister, pointing to certain evidence\nand telling a story intended to win over the jury to a particular point of\nview. In other words, artistic preferences are not entirely relativistic.\n\nConsider a case in which you read a novel and find it underwhelming \u2013 it\ndidn\u2019t capture your imagination or engage you. But later you speak to a friend\nwho explains how the novel alludes to certain literary tropes, or subverts the\ngenre in some unique way, or satirises a political movement you were unaware\nof. You might find that your mind has changed. Your attention has been drawn\nto features of the novel and, to borrow Iris Murdoch\u2019s words, you have been\nforced to \u2018look again\u2019.\n\nIn \u2018Natural Rights\u2019, Macdonald argues that ethical judgments (eg, \u2018murder is\nwrong\u2019 or \u2018it is wrong to steal\u2019), while they are not empirical in same way\nthat scientific hypotheses are \u2013 they cannot be tested by experiment \u2013 are\nnonetheless meaningful. And, again, she draws on judgments about the arts as a\nmodel for what meaningful, but non-empirical, statements might look like. For\nMacdonald, the job of a moral philosopher is akin to that of an art critic:\nboth are in the business of defending or justifying certain judgments or\npreferences. It\u2019s not, as Russell says, as simple as liking one image more\nthan another. There\u2019s an onus on being able to justify or rationalise that\npreference.\n\nThe worry might persist that surely there\u2019s the matter of truth to contend\nwith. Philosophical theories might be like good stories, but surely only one\nof those stories can be true, or at least closer to the truth than another?\nMacdonald doesn\u2019t address this question head-on so it isn\u2019t obvious what her\nanswer would be. I have attempted to show that her view is that even our\nindividual preferences can be defended or justified, just like works of art,\nmeaning that our philosophical views need not purely come down to mere gut\nintuitions. But I am tempted to suggest that Macdonald would not be overly\nconcerned about truth \u2013 at least not in the way we usually think of it. Other\nscholars, like Cheryl Misak, have connected Macdonald to pragmatist\nphilosophers like Frank Ramsey. Pragmatism, in a nutshell, is the view that\nwhat is true is what is useful. And different philosophical theories can be\nuseful to different people for different reasons (such as, Macdonald might\nadd, their temperament). While it is by no means explicit, the relativistic\nbent to Macdonald\u2019s account of philosophical theories might signal that she\nwas influenced by pragmatist ways of thinking about truth.\n\nWhile Russell\u2019s comparison between Bergson\u2019s philosophy and the writings of\nShakespeare or Shelley is intended as a form of criticism, Macdonald argues\nthat an appreciation of the arts is key to understanding where the value of\nphilosophical enquiry lies. In fact, Macdonald argues that philosophers ought\nto stop trying to make scientific philosophy a thing \u2013 because it is dangerous\nfor philosophy. So long as philosophers like Russell keep up the pretence that\nphilosophy ought to be like science, they are judging it by a standard that it\ncannot hope to meet \u2013 precisely because philosophical \u2018theories\u2019 aren\u2019t\nempirically testable.\n\nBut Macdonald\u2019s attempts to push philosophy away from science and towards the\narts isn\u2019t just a defensive manoeuvre. It\u2019s also, she thinks, a way of making\nthe value of philosophy clearer. For Macdonald, philosophy\u2019s value lies not in\nproviding us with new facts about the world, but rather in helping to see the\nfamiliar in a new light, in drawing attention to features of experience that\nmight ordinarily pass us by, and by providing us with stories that can help\nmake better sense of the world around us. Whether her story about what\nphilosophy is is better than Russell\u2019s story, or just a different story, well,\nthat\u2019s up to you to decide.\n\nThinkers and theoriesHistory of ideasPhilosophy of language\n\n15 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nMetaphysics\n\nThe enchanted vision\n\nLove is much more than a mere emotion or moral ideal.
