Hence, we are sharing\nour concerns externally.\n\nWe, Meta employees, wish to express our disappointment and astonishment at the\nlack of acknowledgement and care the leaders of this company have shown toward\nthe Palestinian community and its allies. In private conversations, we hear\nfrom our Palestinian colleagues about family members they have lost in Gaza\nand family they are working tirelessly to find safety for. However, any open\nsupport for our Palestinian colleagues or the millions facing a humanitarian\ncrisis in Palestine is met with internal censorship of employee concerns,\nbiased leadership statements showing one-sided support, and external\ncensorship that is raising public alarm and distrust of our platforms.\n\nInternally, we have called out the months of silencing within our workplace\nforums. While we loudly display \u201cYour voice is valued\u201d, CEE is used as a guise\nto delete dissenting opinions and silence employees that may simply be seeking\nsolace from their coworkers or raising awareness about building safer\nproducts. While in other companies, employees within Employee Resource Groups\n(ERG) are allowed to connect and speak freely with each other, ERG\u2019s such as\nMuslims@ and Palestinians@ have faced so much censorship that an employee\nproposed just deleting the ERG altogether instead of giving the illusion that\nwe can freely build community at Meta. CEE claims to reduce disruptions in our\nworkplace, yet censorship from CEE has caused many of us at Meta to feel\ndisrupted, unheard, and unsafe to the point that several of our Metamates have\ndecided to resign. In the words of our former colleague, any mention of\nPalestine is taken down - Even when the post was from a colleague expressing\ntheir grief. Even when the post was to celebrate the UN International day of\nsupport to the Palestinian people. Even when the post is a link to a\nfundraiser to help the Gazans. Even when asking questions about product bugs\nthat affect Palestinian voices.\n\nOne of the original core values of Facebook was to \u201cBe Open\u201d and our current\nvalues claim that \u201cWe create a culture where we are straightforward and\nwilling to have hard conversations with each other.\u201d Employees have always\nbeen first responders to surface issues raised externally to those internally\nwith the power and knowledge to fix them. However when over 450 colleagues\ncame together to sign a letter similar to this one in December, CEE was used\nto delete the letter and restrict one of the writers from their work devices\nfor over two months while the workplace, product, and policy concerns brought\nforth were completely ignored. Employees have attempted to raise product\nconcerns related to the conflict only to have their posts and comments\ncensored or dismissed throughout internal channels. Most recently, questions\nabout investigative reports indicating the possibility of governments, ISPs,\nand coordinated bad actors using Whatsapp data for military targeting have\nbeen met with dismissive and insufficient responses or outright deleted\nthroughout internal forums.\n\nMeta leaders have posted numerous strong statements of support for our Israeli\ncolleagues along with condemnation of the attack on Israel on October 7th that\ntook the lives of ~1,200 civilians, both on internal and external platforms.\nMark stated on his public Facebook - \u201cThe terrorist attacks by Hamas are pure\nevil. There is never any justification for carrying out acts of terrorism\nagainst innocent people. The widespread suffering that has resulted is\ndevastating. My focus remains on the safety of our employees and their\nfamilies in Israel and the region.\u201d\n\nHowever, bias and inequity is painfully apparent when those same leaders do\nnot similarly share support for our Palestinian colleagues and allies nor\ncondemnation of the attacks on Palestine, which have now taken ~35,000\ncivilian lives and created a humanitarian crisis of displacement and\nstarvation for ~2 million Palestinians. This has created a hostile and unsafe\nwork environment for hundreds of our Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, anti-Zionist\nJew, and anti-genocide colleagues at the company, who have felt consistently\nalienated and uncomfortable at work. Many have tried to articulate this\nthrough posts on Workplace only to be censored, rebuffed, and/or penalized.\nFeedback shared directly with leadership on Workplace Chat has been met with\ndismissiveness. Bias and inequity for the human rights and humanitarian crisis\nin Gaza is also apparent when compared to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\nafter which there was an outpouring of leadership support on all fronts,\nincluding additional resourcing and investment through various social impact\ninitiatives. The lights in the Dublin office were even painted with the colors\nof the Ukraine flag. Leadership must do better to achieve true equity and\ninclusion.\n\nExternally, when it comes to Palestine, the dismissive tone and lack of\ninvestment by Meta is not new and the company has consistently failed to\nthoroughly take action on years of evidence of suppression of Palestinian\nvoices on our platforms worldwide. In 2024 the company is still slowly\naddressing the findings of an independent audit influenced by Human Rights\nWatch\u2019s (HRW) 2021 letter to Meta on the Palestinian conflict 3 years ago. In\nthe wake of October 7th, Meta has ignored reasonable requests for transparency\non our content policies from Senator Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers\naround the globe. Numerous civil rights organizations, some of whom are Meta\npartners, have been met with dismissal on the censorship concerns brought\nforth - leading to external petitions such as one against Meta\u2019s proposed\npolicy of treating \u201cZionist\u201d as a proxy for \"Jewish\u201d, which collected over\n52,000 signatures.\n\nWhile Meta denies any Palestinian censorship or bias to the public, internally\ngroups of employee volunteers have found numerous product and policy issues\nwith disparate impacts to Palestinian, Muslim, and Arab communities since\nOctober 7th. The few improvements that have been made were achieved only by\nappealing to isolated product teams, with minimal senior leadership support or\nresources. Furthermore, in the wake of global criticism of censorship and\nmoderation, leading into the biggest year for democracy in history, Meta has\nupdated its policy to no longer recommend \u2018political content\u2019 by default\nacross Instagram and Threads without clear guidelines of how this would impact\ncontent originating from global conflict zones. Meta has continued to fail the\nPalestinian community through its policies and lack of investment.\n\n\u201cMeta.Metamate.Me.\u201d We believe we are all Meta and are committed to\nrespectfully working together to address the issues internally and externally,\nwhile holding firmly to the demands we have been echoing for months:\n\n  1. We demand an end to censorship - stop deleting employee\u2019s words internally in order to foster an inclusive environment where all communities feel seen, heard, and safe\n\n  2. We demand acknowledgment - share internal acknowledgments of support for Palestinian colleagues and acknowledge the lives lost in the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza to recognize our shared humanity\n\n  3. We demand transparency and accountability - allocate dedicated resources to investigate issues of censorship and biases on our platforms and openly disclose findings to build trust among employees and the public\n\n  4. We implore you to end the silence - issue a public statement urging for an immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaza\n\nAs tech workers, we have a tremendous privilege to work on products that serve\nthe world, and with that comes tremendous responsibility. We have been proud\nto work at Meta \u2013 and want to continue believing in its mission to give people\nthe power to build community and bring the world closer together.\n\nPlease sign the letter here. The letter will be updated with signatories\nperiodically, listed in alphabetical order:\n\n", "frontpage": false}
