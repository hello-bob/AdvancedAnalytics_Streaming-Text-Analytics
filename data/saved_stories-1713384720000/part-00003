Everything\n\n(Mis)Uses of Technology\n\n### from the dumb-is-smart dept\n\nTue, Apr 16th 2024 03:32pm - Karl Bode\n\nWhen last we checked in with our friends at Roku, they had made the unpopular\ndecision to effectively \u201cbrick\u201d user streaming hardware and television sets if\nusers didn\u2019t agree to a typically draconian end user agreement that\neffectively bans your legal right to sue the company.\n\nEroding your legal rights using fine print isn\u2019t new; it\u2019s been a U.S.\ncorporate standard since the Supreme Court gave AT&T the green light to do so\nway back in 2011, and part of Roku\u2019s plans since 2019. Being extra annoying\nabout it was a new wrinkle; but this too isn\u2019t all that uncommon for publicly-\ntraded companies trying to boost growth, revenues, and market share at any\ncost.\n\nBut such behavior has diminishing returns, of course. You can cross a\nthreshold where you\u2019re so focused on boosting revenues that you forget about\nthe end user experience and drive users to the exits through sheer annoyance.\n\nThat\u2019s the mode Roku\u2019s clearly in now, as made evident by recent behavior and\na new patent the company has filed that would help the company force ads on\ntop of whatever you\u2019re watching on your Roku TV, regardless of whether or not\nyou have a third-party device or game console attached:\n\n> \u201cA patent application from the company spotted by Lowpass describes a system\n> for displaying ads over any device connected over HDMI, a list that could\n> include cable boxes, game consoles, DVD or Blu-ray players, PCs, or even\n> other video-streaming devices. Roku filed for the patent in August 2023, and\n> it was published in November 2023, though it hasn\u2019t yet been granted.\u201d\n\nSo, in other words, if you attached a third-party streaming competitor\u2019s\ndevice to your Roku TV, and the TV detected that you had paused playback, it\nwould insert a static or video ad into the screen. Of course it\u2019s just a\npatent and doesn\u2019t mean this will be implemented, but it is kind of\nrepresentative of the broader \u201csmart\u201d TV sector, which cares less and less\nabout product quality as it pursues data monetization.\n\nFor years all I\u2019ve ever wanted from TV manufacturers is an extremely \u201cdumb\u201d 4K\n65 inch TV that has a whole bunch of HDMI inputs, but no \u201csmart\u201d internals.\nSince I know the real money is increasingly made from spying on users and\nmonetizing their every fart (while failing to properly secure the collected\ndata), I\u2019ve even been willing to pay extra for simplicity, quality, and\nprivacy.\n\nYes, I know I can simply not connect my TV to the internet. But that\u2019s not\nfixing my problem. Even basic HDMI switching and settings are now tethered to\nclunky, bloated, smart internals and GUIs that take time to load, and get\nslower as the TV ages. Some manufacturers also block you from basic functions\nunless you agree to be tracked and monetized. And yes, I could also buy a\nbusiness-class set, but such options are cost prohibitive and often lack\nfeatures like HDR.\n\nInstead of having a business segment that tailors to people who simply want a\nquality, dumb-as-a-box-of-hammers television, the market keeps heading in the\nother direction (like this TV that shows ads on a second screen, constantly,\neven when the primary TV is off).\n\nI know why they\u2019re doing it, but I don\u2019t have to like it. And I know that\ngiven the tendency of publicly-traded companies to push their luck to please\nWall Street\u2019s incessant demand for improved quarterly returns, there\neventually comes a point where user annoyance causes a revolt, and the company\nin question usually stumbles forth anyway, oblivious.\n\nFiled Under: 4k, ad injection, advertising, hdr, injected ads, privacy, smart\ntv, surveillance, television, tv Companies: roku\n\n38 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Congress Decides To Give FBI Another Free Pass On Section 702 Abuses\n  * Partisan Bullshit Tanks House Section 702 Reform Efforts\n  * Whoops: Data Broker Data Reveals Rich Visitors To Jeffrey Epstein's Island\n  * Jim Jordan Demands Major Ad Companies Explain Why They Won\u2019t Advertise On Truth Social\n  * AT&T Stops Pretending It Had Nothing To Do With A Massive Data Breach Impacting 73 Million Customers.

And the problem of ads can presumably be solved with\na curtain or a small piece of furniture.\n\nPeople actually pay for those TVs and Roku boxes that show ads and probably\nabuse personal data. That\u2019s a whole other level of badness. Magazines and\nnewspapers used to do the same (still do, for the few still using them).\n\n(Similarly, people like to mention that cable TV was originally ad-free, but\nthat was never true. Maybe some pay channels enshittified themselves.)\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nStephen T.

I\ncan\u2019t evaluate the claim as I\u2019ve never been in the market for a TV or bought\none\u2014computer monitors seem good enough, and these days a TV is just a large\nmonitor that maybe cuts off the edges of the video signal and has ads.\n\nStill, family members give me shit about using a monitor, making it sound like\na \u201cTV\u201d is an absolute necessity. While bitching about theirs. And here\u2019s Karl\nsaying complaining all products on the market suck, and I just can\u2019t relate.\nAs a child, my family gathered around a 20-incher when my eyes were terrible\nbut I didn\u2019t yet know I needed glasses, and I was jealous of the home theater\npeople who spent thousands of dollars to get 40- and 50-inchers. Now I can see\nbetter, and 65 inches and 4K and HDR has apparently become some kind of\nminimum standard? I\u2019ve still got some old 512\u00d7384 DivX DVD-rips from the\n1990s, and while a bit more resolution is nice, I don\u2019t see it being\nparticularly important for TV shows.\n\n(I would like higher pixel density for computer stuff, so as to make anti-\naliased font rendering rendering obsolete\u2014it never looks quite right. And\nfaster updates to eliminate blurring. MicroLED looks promising.)\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 17, 2024 at 5:32 am\n\n# Re: Re: Re:^2\n\nTakes like this are simply wild.

And it\u2019s not even\nthe desire per se that\u2019s surprising; just the shit that people are willing to\nput up with to get those sizes. It\u2019s not hard to find monitors in the\n30-to-40-inch range, and I don\u2019t think 10 to 20 extra inches is worth dealing\nwith all the stuff Karl and others are mentioning.\n\n> why most people want a remote\n\nThat remains a bit of a mystery, because most people I know do not commonly\nuse their TV remote.\n\nCable TV requires a box at each TV, and it\u2019s that remote that people use.\nExcept maybe if they need to switch inputs, or if that remote can\u2019t control\ntheir TV\u2019s volume (but someone that picky about picture quality probably wants\ngood 5.1 sound too, which means they\u2019re not using the TV\u2019s sound anyway).\n\nAnd you\u2019re missing the bit about the remotes being shitty. The last good\ninfra-red remote I used was circa 1990; it took a 9-volt battery, responded\ninstantly, and was bright enough to control the TV with no line of sight (even\nwith my hand tightly covering the emitter, or from other rooms). Modern infra-\nred remotes seem slow and unreliable by comparison, so I\u2019ve been using a\nradio-based remote for the last couple decades\u2014just not for a \u201cTV\u201d. There are\nalso Bluetooth remotes, which TV manufacturers would\u2019ve presumbly switched to\nlong ago if they didn\u2019t hate their customers.\n\n> why most people want something that makes it simple to just watch things,\n> and in general why your hardcore nerd solutions aren\u2019t suitable to the\n> general public.\n\nMeh. My mother\u2019s hardly been able to easily work the TV since the cable\ncompany forced them to upgrade to digital service. Also see the adjacent story\nabout Bell screwing over their DVR subscribers.\n\nIt\u2019d be nice to have something simple and good, and I get why people want it.\nBut the market\u2019s just not providing that and hasn\u2019t been for quite some time.\nSo either they get nerdy, or switch to books, or become resigned to hating\nthemselves and paying for shitty products and services from people who are\nworking against them. (Like Netflix, now a MAFIAA member whose \u201csuggestions\u201d\nare mostly the stuff that\u2019s cheap to license. If you don\u2019t have a personal\nrecommendation from someone and just want to browse, you\u2019d better have\nsomething like IMDb open on the side, because the ratings on most of what they\nsuggest are shockingly low.)\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 17, 2024 at 8:06 am\n\n# Re: Re: Re:^4\n\nI guess it really is that difficult to develop basic self-awareness.

Nearly every article and review was unanimous: buy a Roku. So I\ndid, and it sucked. It literally has ad buttons built into the remote. The\ninterface was slow, clunky, disorganized, and also riddled with ads. They\u2019re\nso dependent on ad revenue that they\u2019d often get new streaming apps last,\ndespite having the largest market share, simply because they had to negotiate\nad and data collection deals with those platforms. After only a few months of\nowning what was basically a brand new device, Roku announced a new major OS\nupdate that current devices would not get. After less than a year we\u2019d\nsuddenly get no further updates. Users revolted and they were pressured into\nchanging their plans, but I still replaced my garbage Roku with an Apple TV, a\nfar better device in every way.\n\nRoku has been an atrocious company from the very beginning and yet somehow was\nthe darling of the tech media and their every product met with universally\npositive reviews. I\u2019m honestly glad they finally took their mask completely\noff enough for others to finally notice how awful this company is, but I still\ncan\u2019t make sense of why it took so long.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\n## Add Your Comment Cancel reply\n\nTechdirt Podcast Episode 387: Abolishing Section 230 Would Abolish Wikipedia\n\nBell Canada, After Nixxing Most Hardware DVR, Changes Cloud PVR Recording\nRetention\n\nFollow Techdirt\n\n### Techdirt Daily Newsletter\n\nA weekly news podcast from Mike Masnick & Ben Whitelaw\n\nSubscribe now to Ctrl-Alt-Speech \u00bb\n\nEssential Reading\n\n#### The Techdirt Greenhouse\n\nRead the latest posts:\n\n  * Winding Down Our Latest Greenhouse Panel: The Lessons Learned From SOPA/PIPA\n  * From The Revolt Against SOPA To The EU's Upload Filters\n  * Did We Miss Our Best Chance At Regulating The Internet?\n\nRead All \u00bb\n\n#### Trending Posts\n\n  * Bell Canada, After Nixxing Most Hardware DVR, Changes Cloud PVR Recording Retention\n  * Roku Eyes Patent That Would Inject Ads Into...

I'm surrounded by a pack of assholes.\"\n  * That said, the art of sounding right while being wrong is surely a featured curriculum at many US universities.\n  * BentFranklin: Keeping your data from Apple is harder than expected [article]\n\nhttps://www.aalto.fi/en/news/keeping-your-data-from-apple-is-harder-than-\nexpected\n\n  * mildconcern: And keeping the federal government running with the 5th Circuit around is also harder than expected.\n  * John Roddy: I'm waiting for the fifth circuit to issue a nationwide injunction on nationwide injunctions from the fifth circuit.\n  * mildconcern: If that causes the circuit to disappear in an internal contradiction, I'm all for it\n  * candescence: As usual, Elon is being a hypocrite about his whole \"well I'll follow the law\" stuff now that he's having beef with Brazil\n  * Mostly because it involves a left-wing government taking down right-wing content and banning right-wingers for breaking hate speech laws in the wake of Bolsonaro trying to stage a coup\n  * Meanwhile he's \"too busy\" to look into Twitter bowing to India and banning Modi's critics, as well as banning people connected to Alexei Navalny and voicing doubts about the Russian government's role in his death\n  * mildconcern: @Mike Masnick did you get to see totality? Skies were clear and the crowd was shouting in northern Vermont, though I could have done without the 11 hour car ride home.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yup! We're in Texas and ended up driving pretty far out to where it was predicted to be clearer and we had a great view.\n  * John Roddy: It's funny. I've actually been going around telling people that Sun is currently nearing the peak of its 11-year cycle and has been unusually active recently.\n  * Didn't even occur to me that you'd be able to *see* that during the eclipse.\n  * Because the corona is where all of that really shows.\n  * Also spaceweather.gov\n  * Not enough government websites have a chart on their homepage that shows real-time updates on the current measured proton flux.\n  * mildconcern: fantastic, I'm glad you got to see it too.\n  * And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n  * Samuel Abram: I took a screencap of a thread on facebook, to illustrate the necessity of checkmarks as verification and not a marker of a paid status.\n  * Unfortunately, I can't upload it here\n  * [link]\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17P1ICo5rwQcW4dnkY8KSX8XzdIXoSQZN/view?usp=drive_link\n\n  * John Roddy: Wow. I legit didn't even realize Lowery was still alive.\n  * He was a grumpy old man last time I encountered him years and years ago, after all.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yes, but he's just asking people to be more \"genuinely empathetic\" like the time he suggested I should get cancer and die in a fire.\n  * John Roddy: I don't know. His decision to back up the guy who compared Brian to Hitler kinda seems to undermine that a bit.\n  * mildconcern: \"Following that were screenshots of tweets (or whatever the fuck)\". You apparently are feeling the same degree of \"done with that shit\" as I am, @Tim Cushing\n  * BentFranklin: Crickets from Chirp Systems in Smart Lock Key Leak [link]\n\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/04/crickets-from-chirp-systems-in-smart-lock-\nkey-leak/\n\n  * Mike Masnick: yikes. that's bad\n  * BentFranklin: \"We justifiably loathe Elon Musk for destroying Twitter, but we should have a hundred times the bile for Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Sundar Pichai. All three have unquestionably damaged our ability to access knowledge through their actively harmful approach to maintaining a portal that billions use to find answers to everything.\" [article]\n\nhttps://www.wheresyoured.at/the-great-looting-of-the-internet/\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Not sure I buy that argument entirely. Especially as I see the enshittification of Google as (finally) a window of opportunity for others to step in\n  * John Roddy: Cloud powered AI cryptocurrency\n  * mildconcern: Yeah Google is so much easier to switch away from than a social network.\n  * I've been using Kagi for months now and haven't looked back. I tried DuckDuckGo and found that I often had to try Google when it failed. I haven't had to do the same with Kagi.\n  * Mike Masnick: kagi has been good for me too...\n  * Samuel Abram: It's just that Kagi costs money and google doesn't\n  * BentFranklin: That sounds great actually, considering what free gets you these days. Maybe someone can get Kagi added to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogl...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/wiki/index\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Wednesday  \n  \n---  \n05:29| The GOP Is Blocking A Last Ditch Effort To Bring Cheap Broadband To\nPoor Americans (9)  \n  \n## Tuesday  \n  \n19:41| Bell Canada, After Nixxing Most Hardware DVR, Changes Cloud PVR\nRecording Retention (14)  \n15:32| Roku Eyes Patent That Would Inject Ads Into...
