In just one week, from 26 February to 3\nMarch, Russia used more than 500 [guided aerial bombs with a mounted UMPC]\u201d.\n\nThe freefalling Soviet design bombs used by the Russian military are being\neasily transformed into guided ones by adding a UMPC \u201cplanning and correction\nmodule\u201d, cheap wings and satellite navigation systems.\n\nThey are described in the military as being \u201cdrop-and-forget\u201d as aircraft\ncarrying them are able to fire out of reach of Ukraine\u2019s air-defence systems.\n\nRussia\u2019s air force appears to have been a key player in turning the tide of\nthe war in the Kremlin\u2019s favour in recent months at a time when Ukraine\u2019s air\ndefences are at a low ebb.\n\nA recent paper from the International Institute for Strategic Studies warned:\n\u201cRussia is using glide bombs, along with direct-attack munitions, in volume to\noverwhelm Ukrainian air defence.\u201d\n\nThe thinktank noted that the source of the success of the weapon was the lack\nof capacity within the Ukrainian air defence.\n\n\u201cThe reduced rate of missile engagements and the growing number of glide-bomb\nattacks are indicative of the scarcity of air-defence weapons,\u201d they wrote.\n\u201cThis shortage is in part due to delays in European aid and the hold up of the\nlatest US military-aid package, which is worth around $60bn. Passed by the US\nSenate in February, it has failed to win the support of the Republican-\ncontrolled House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nRussia is reliant on foreign-made components but has not found any difficulty\nin importing them, despite the west imposing sanctions.\n\nThe Ukrainian report on the latest military developments notes that on the\nsamples of such munitions obtained by its forces the \u201csurface of electronic\ncomponents is rubbed or varnished, which prevents the identification of some\ncomponents\u201d.\n\nAnalysts have, however, identified a variety of key pieces of technology in\nthe guided bombs which are said to have been imported to Russia via China,\nThailand and Turkey. The components were originally made by companies in the\nUS, China and Japan, it is claimed, although there is no evidence that any of\nthe manufacturers have breached the western sanctions regime on imports to\nRussia.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to This is Europe\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to\neconomics to the environment\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei\nLavrov, while on a two-day visit to Beijing, increased that anxiety by\nclaiming that the two countries had agreed to discuss ways to deepen their\nsecurity cooperation. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, also warned\nduring a parallel trip to China that there would be \u201csignificant consequences\u201d\nfor any Chinese companies supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nUMPC systems attached to bombs \u201cgenerate a flight path depending on the\nreceived flight tasks with location correction\u201d enabled through global\nnavigation systems, according to the Ukrainian government report.\n\nA key developer of the technology being attached to the bombs is said to be\nthe Russian manufacturer NPO Basalt JSC, which is able to produce 500 units a\nmonth.\n\nThe bombs \u2013 ranging from the 250kg FAB-250 to the 1,500kg FAB-1500s \u2013 on which\nthe guidance systems are often attached, are high explosive and have a\n\u201crelatively robust casing for penetrating soil or obstacles such as interfloor\nfloors of buildings and structures\u201d, according to the Ukrainian report. The\nestimated range of the middle-weight FAB-500 is 55-60km.\n\nThe heavier bombs are said by the analysis to be carried by Su-34 and Su-35S\nprecision bombers. \u201cThe onboard equipment of these aircraft probably allows\nchanging the coordinates of their target during the flight but before launch\u201d,\nthe Ukrainian report says.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201ccivilians and civil infrastructure are also often\ntargeted\u201d. It cites a strike that damaged 15 high-rise buildings, injuring 16\ncivilians, including two children, in Kurakhove, in the Donetsk region, on 3\nMarch, and strikes in the Kharkiv region on 7 and 27 March that killed two and\ninjured 17.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Ukraine\n  * Russia\n  * Europe\n  * Arms trade\n  * China\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Ukraine war briefing: Long-range Atacms missiles on the way, says Zelenskiy\n\n13h ago\n\n  * ### Rishi Sunak promises UK\u2019s largest ever military support package for Ukraine\n\n16h ago\n\n  * ### The Guardian view on arming Ukraine: US Congress votes against appeasement\n\n19h ago\n\n  * ### EU ministers warned not to relax support for Ukraine amid requests for air defence aid\n\n22h ago\n\n  * ### Did Boris Johnson really sabotage peace talks between Russia and Ukraine?
