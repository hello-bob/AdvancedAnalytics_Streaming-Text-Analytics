An earlier version of the bill could have banned\nthe popular video-sharing app prior to the election, but recent changes mean\nCongress and Biden may not face such an immediate voter backlash.\n\nThe new legislation provides nine months for TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent\ncompany, ByteDance, to sell it or face a nationwide prohibition in the United\nStates. The president can grant a one-time extension of 90 days, bringing the\ntimeline to sell to one year, if he certifies that there\u2019s a path to\ndivestiture and \u201csignificant progress\u201d toward executing it.\n\nEven without the extension, the earliest a ban could start is January 2025.\nWith the extension, it would be April. And with TikTok threatening legal\naction, the matter could get tied up in the courts for even longer. It\u2019s a\nshift from an earlier House-passed bill that included a six-month window that\ncould have triggered a TikTok ban before the November election.\n\nA senior Republican aide said Democrats were responsible for the change.\n\u201cSenate Democrats had been pretty consistent about wanting to extend that\ntimeline,\u201d the aide said.\n\nThe election was \u201cdefinitely\u201d something \u201cconveniently addressed\u201d by the new\ndeadline, said a Democratic source close to the issue.\n\nOther Democrats are assuring voters that ByteDance would sooner sell TikTok\nthan risk a U.S. ban, a view some experts disagree with.\n\n\u201cTikTok ain\u2019t going away. There is no more capitalistic entity than an\norganization controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. They\u2019re going to sell\nit,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Armed Services Committee, who\nfaces re-election this fall. \u201cYoung people will go on their TikTok tomorrow\nand they\u2019ll still have it. And then the day after that, they\u2019ll still have it.\nAnd the day after that, they\u2019ll still have it,\u201d Kaine said, adding that the\nonly difference is it will be American-owned. \u201cIf you like it, you\u2019re going to\nkeep it.\u201d\n\nIn endorsing the revised TikTok bill, Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria\nCantwell, D-Wash., said that extending ByteDance\u2019s divestment period \u2014 what\nshe called her \u201crecommendation\u201d \u2014 would help ensure there is \u201cenough time for\na new buyer to get a deal done.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers who helped negotiate that change, including Rep. Raja\nKrishnamoorthi, D-Ill., agreed that the reason they pushed back the deadline\nwas to improve the chances of a sale.\n\n\u201cThis gives more time to make the divestment achievable,\u201d said Krishnamoorthi,\nthe top Democrat on the special committee investigating the CCP. \u201cIt made a\nlot of sense. That\u2019s why, as you could tell, we didn\u2019t lose any votes because\nof the change. In fact, we gained some votes \u2014 we went from 352 to 360 votes\nin the House.\u201d\n\n## Trump, who tried his own ban, tells 'the young people' to blame Biden\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, sought to\nexploit a ban politically.\n\n\u201cJust so everyone knows, especially the young people, Crooked Joe Biden is\nresponsible for banning TikTok,\u201d Trump said on social media. \u201cHe is the one\npushing it to close ... Young people, and lots of others, must remember this\non November 5th, ELECTION DAY, when they vote!\u201d\n\nIt's a flip-flop for the former president, who signed an executive order in\nAugust 2020 to ban TikTok in 45 days if it was not sold. His statement cited\n\u201cthe threat posed\u201d by China with its ability under Chinese law to force the\napp to grant access to Americans\u2019 data and its potential to manipulate the\nalgorithm to advance Chinese propaganda \u2014 the same reasons Congress and Biden\nfavor a ban.\n\nBut the executive order was blocked in court, and the app persisted.\n\n\u201cI have every expectation that TikTok will be alive and well, no matter who is\npresident,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \u201cDonald Trump is obviously\ntrying to turn it into an election issue, but considering he was in favor of\nbanning it, I think his warning is more baloney to use a polite word.\u201d\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said opinions about TikTok and social media won\u2019t\n\u201crival choice and democracy and immigration as a voting issue\u201d in the 2024\nelection.\n\nBut Murphy said the political implications cut both ways.\n\n\u201cI am part of a group of pissed-off parents that feel that they\u2019ve lost\ncontrol of their kids\u2019 lives. There\u2019s undoubtedly another group of kids who\nare worried that they\u2019re going to lose access to social media in the way that\nthey have it now,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut those are two very distinct voting groups\nand if you ignore the perils of social media, maybe you pick up some younger\nvoters, but you lose some parents. So this is one of these issues where you\nhave to see the full picture.\u201d\n\nRep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., who voted against the TikTok ban over the weekend,\ntold NBC News in an interview that there is a need to solve the national\nsecurity and data concerns associated with the platform but added that banning\nTikTok would be disastrous for creators, organizers and activists.\n\n\u201cI think this is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, where we\nhave people, communities that are able to organize, that are able to meet,\nthat are able to find space for their businesses to grow\" on TikTok, she said.\n\u201cWe need to actually think about what the consequences of that are, not\npolitical consequences alone. But the consequences holistically.\u201d\n\n## 'The battle lines aren't really clear'\n\nA Republican working on Senate races said being tough on TikTok would have\nbeen an easier message to drive home in the campaign before Trump himself came\nout against the ban.\n\n\u201cIt used to be a lot more straightforward,\u201d this person said of how they could\nmessage against Democrats who use TikTok to campaign \u2014 which, despite Biden's\nintention to sign the ban legislation, includes his campaign. \u201cBut Trump is on\nthe other side now. It makes the whole thing a little murkier. The battle\nlines aren\u2019t really clear.\u201d\n\nStill, the Republican believes that a looming ban could have a big impact on\nthe campaign trail for Democrats who use TikTok, saying candidates are using\nit exclusively as a tool to reach voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really clear they think it\u2019s an important tool in their toolbox,\u201d this\nperson said.\n\n### Recommended\n\n2024 Election\n\n### 2024 ElectionBob Casey and Dave McCormick advance to the general election\nin Pennsylvania, setting up a key race for Senate control\n\nWar in Ukraine\n\n### War in UkraineNew U.S. military aid is finally heading to Ukraine \u2014 but is\nit too little, too late?\n\nIn frontline battleground Senate states, Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, of\nOhio, and Bob Casey, of Pennsylvania, are active on the platform. So, too, are\nDemocratic Reps. Ruben Gallego, of Arizona, and Colin Allred, of Texas, both\nrunning for Senate seats in competitive races this fall. Gallego and Allred\nvoted for the TikTok ban in the House.\n\nBrown\u2019s campaign declined to comment. Casey\u2019s campaign said it could not\ncomment ahead of the Senate vote. Campaigns for Gallego and Allred did not\nimmediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBiden's campaign said only that the campaign is on TikTok but that the\npresident doesn't have an official account on the platform.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked late Tuesday about a\npotential backlash to the TikTok crackdown, said: \u201cSpeaker Johnson put it in\nbill \u2014 the big supplemental bill. We had to get the supplemental bill passed\nas quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nSome of Biden's allies disagree with him on a TikTok prohibition.\n\nProgressive Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a Biden campaign surrogate, said he\nopposes a TikTok ban, citing free speech rights.\n\n\u201cThe longer timeline helps marginally in pushing the ban until after the\nelection and the bill, in any case, is likely to get struck down by the\ncourts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut rushing to pass it shows the complete disconnect\nbetween the Beltway establishment and many Americans.\u201d\n\nKhanna's advice for election candidates navigating a voter backlash to a\nTikTok ban?\n\n\u201cI would tell them to follow their heart but take their brain with them,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nScott Wong\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\nAllan Smith\n\nAllan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.\n\nAli Vitali and Henry J.
