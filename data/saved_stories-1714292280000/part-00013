NguyenPublished Apr. 24, 2024 \u2022 6:00am\n\nIn the 2010s, blue-chip tech firms like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Meta and\nSalesforce spent hundreds of millions of dollars opening glamorous, amenity-\nfilled offices in downtown San Francisco, spurring a building boom that\naltered the city\u2019s skyline.\n\nAfter a global pandemic and a wholesale shift to hybrid work, those same firms\nhave retreated en masse\u2014leaving the city\u2019s now hollowed-out downtown to pay\nthe price.\n\nBy the end of 2019, the 20 biggest tech employers had leased more than 16\nmillion square feet of space, nearly a quarter of the city\u2019s total office\nstock. Now, those same companies are holding onto only 8.3 million square\nfeet, according to data from real estate firm CBRE.\n\n\u201cTech companies were the most important as it was related to growth, but\nthey\u2019re also the most responsible for the downsizing as well,\u201d said Colin\nYasukochi, executive director of CBRE\u2019s Tech Insights Center.\n\nWhat drove the city\u2019s previous real estate boom has now busted. And there\u2019s\nstill no clear answer on what comes next.\n\n## \u2018Everyone is splitting\u2019\n\nEven with the recent pickup in office leasing from nascent industries like\nartificial intelligence and climate tech, the scale of Big Tech\u2019s pullback\ndwarfs the total leasing activity over the past two years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just gone from being at the most amazing frat party to now the police\nhave arrived and everyone is splitting,\u201d said a veteran San Francisco tech\noffice broker who asked to be anonymous to preserve existing client\nrelationships.\n\nA few key examples: Last January, Meta listed all 34 floors, or 435,000 square\nfeet, of its office space at the glitzy 181 Fremont skyscraper for sublease\nafter announcing mass layoffs tied to cost-cutting efforts. A company\nspokesperson confirmed Meta kept one office location in the city at 250 Howard\nSt., where it still leases all of the office space at the 43-floor tower.\n\nUber marketed the majority of its new Mission Bay headquarters for sublease last year. | Source: Camille Cohen/The Standard\n\nUber followed Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s lead and put a portion of its massive Mission\nBay headquarters campus up for grabs months later, with two buildings\neventually snapped up by OpenAI last October.\n\nThe city\u2019s largest private employer, Salesforce, said in a recent securities\nfiling that it now owns or leases less than 45% of office space it had from\nthe year prior\u2014about 900,000 square feet, down from 1.6 million, as of last\nJanuary. \u201cOur offices remain a critical part of our culture here in San\nFrancisco, our global headquarters, and around the world,\u201d a Salesforce\nspokesperson said in a statement.\n\nData from Avison Young shows that, among the top 20 tech companies in San\nFrancisco based on office space in 2019, at least four have completely\neliminated their office footprint, with one company reducing its space by over\n730,000 square feet. Another company, which still has offices in the city,\nreduced its space by more than 1 million square feet. Overall, 80% of these\ncompanies have decreased the amount of office space they use in the city.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Big Tech occupied the best spaces while paying top-tier\nrents, real estate experts said. Derek Daniels, regional research director for\nColliers, said the combination of low interest rates and the explosion of\ncloud computing, social media and other technologies drove the previous boom.\n\n\u201cWith expectations of continued growth in funding and headcount, some were\neven committing to proposed [but unbuilt] sites,\u201d Daniels said.\n\nA decade ago, Dropbox once leased over 700,000 square feet of office space at 1800 Owens St. Remote work has led the company to steadily shed its real estate ever since. | Source: Paul Chinn/SF Chronicle/Getty Images\n\nNow, the dynamic has been completely flipped and companies in the market for\nSan Francisco office space do not lack options. Colliers estimates that nearly\n30% of offices are currently vacant. Other firms tag the number as high as\n36%.\n\nPut in physical terms, some 30 million square feet remain empty. As a visual\naid, that\u2019s the equivalent of more than 500 football fields of space or more\nthan 20 Salesforce Towers.\n\nThe slowdown doesn\u2019t appear to be reversing quickly. Revised data from the\nstate Employment Development Department last month showed that the tech\nindustry is still in the midst of shedding jobs after an already painful year\ndefined by layoffs.\n\n## Waiting for the reset\n\nSince most office buildings are tied to a commercial loan, distressed\nlandlords not collecting steady rent checks have either had to walk away from\nproperties or sell at a steep discount. Only once that cycle is completed\u2014and\npre-pandemic rates flushed out\u2014can rent costs finally be reset, experts say.\n\nTake the 22-story office building at 350 California St. as a model. In\nSeptember, San Francisco real estate developers SKS Partners and the Swig\nCompany partnered to purchase the property for around $61 million, roughly 75%\noff the price it went for in 2020.\n\nWith a lower cost burden, the new landlords were able to ink two new office\ntenants that likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford the location previously.\nIn January, nonprofit developer Bridge Housing nabbed the entire 16th floor,\nwhile climate innovation coworking company 9Zero took the fourth floor days\nafter.\n\nRelated\n\nBurdened by debt, savvy SF office owners get creative\n\nSan Francisco commercial property owners have billions in debt coming due.\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThe next era of San Francisco commercial real estate will begin in 2024\n\nSimilarly, the City and County of San Francisco announced it was exiting its\nlease from 1155 Market St. last month in favor of a discounted deal and newer\ndigs down the street at 1455 Market St., the former home of Uber and Block.\n\nWhereas the last run on real estate was driven by unicorn startups and Silicon\nValley giants, the biggest office leases so far this year are from less-flashy\ncompanies taking advantage of lower rents to accommodate their growing\nheadcounts.\n\nThis new six-story building was leased by Pinterest before the social media giant put it up for sublease in the wake of the pandemic. | Source: Kevin V. Nguyen/The Standard\n\nDutch payment processing company Adyen snapped up Pinterest\u2019s entire building\nat 505 Brannan St. in February, while HR automation software company Rippling\njust leased nine floors at 430 California St., once entirely occupied by\nWeWork.\n\nMeanwhile, with the larger tech industry in retreat, all eyes are fixed upon\nAI to take the torch. Real estate sources said last week OpenAI is still\nshopping for more office space despite recently expanding its footprint.\n\nJLL Senior Analyst Chris Pham said while the focus has been on the large-\nlanguage model AI companies, the potential for growth in the next few years\nwill come from those who build applications on top of those models, likening\nthem to \u201cthe next Uber and Facebook.\u201d\n\nCiting PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates, Pham\u2019s team estimates that AI\ncompanies will lease up to 12 million square feet in San Francisco by 2030.\n\nBut it\u2019s best to keep expectations tempered, others say. AI is still a part of\na larger industry going through an existential realignment.\n\n\u201cThe current tech turnaround will take a few years to broaden into a much\nlarger growth cycle,\u201d Yasukochi of CBRE said. \u201cTech still has the highest\ngrowth potential for San Francisco since financial and legal have been\ndeclining in employment for decades.\u201d\n\nKevin V.
