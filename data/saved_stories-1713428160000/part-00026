It\u2019s a newer project developed by Ben\nPate, and it does something totally new: composable interfaces.\n\nEmissary FediForum demo\n\nThe secret sauce behind Emissary as a project is brilliant in its simplicity:\nit gives you a server and a bunch of tools, and gives you the power to build\nwhatever interface you want on top of it. It\u2019s very reminiscent of Hubzilla,\nbut it makes customization a first-class citizen.\n\n## Deep Customization\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of moving parts here, but it\u2019s pretty easy to summarize: instead\nof simply giving you the power to customize how Emissary looks, you\u2019re also\ngiven the power to customize how it works.\n\nExamples from the FediForum demo. Left to right: a social reader view, a to-do\nlist view, and a social profile view. All of these were developed using\nEmissary\u2019s powerful templating system.\n\nEmissary offers comprehensive documentation, and a bunch of different template\ntypes that can assist in building whatever app comes to mind. From the layout\nand widgets to the timelines and data types.\n\nBy following this method, is possible to turn Emissary into whatever platform\nyou want. It uses a special JSON templating system, and the frontend processes\neverything with a toolkit based on HTMX. For developers, this means that you\ndon\u2019t need to write a frontend in a special custom framework \u2013 instead,\nEmissary uses the principles of HTML for development.\n\nContrary to other attempts to build this kind of thing in the past, Emissary\nlets developers write timelines and activity data as templates. Here\u2019s how you\ncan define a simple to-do list item:\n\n### Template Definitions\n\nThis part exists at the top of the template, and simply defines what it is,\nand provides some instructions for how it\u2019s used by Emissary.\n\n    \n    \n    templateId:\"test-todo-item\" templateRole:\"todo-item\" socialRole:\"Note\" model:\"stream\" containedBy: [\"todo\"] label:\"To Do Item\" description:\"A single item in a to-do list\" icon:\"check-badge\"\n\nJSON\n\n### Schema\n\nThis part defines the actual fields of the object itself. Every single\nproperty is defined as a type, with additional fields nested in the actual\ndata itself. Here, the data property includes dueDate and complete.\n\n    \n    \n    schema: { type:\"object\" properties: { label: {type:\"string\", maxlength: 64} summary: {type:\"string\", maxlength: 256} data: {type:\"object\", properties: { dueDate: {type:\"string\", format:\"date\"} complete: {type:\"boolean\"} }} }\n\nJSON\n\n### Actions\n\nHere, the allowed actions are defined. Each action is built up of multiple\nsteps, which are tasks that can be mixed and matched to make something happen.\nLet\u2019s look through it.\n\n    \n    \n    actions: { create: { steps: [ {do:\"as-modal\", \"steps\": [ {do:\"edit\", \"form\": { type:\"layout-vertical\" label:\"Add Task\" children: [ {type:\"text\", label:\"Name\", path:\"label\"} {type:\"textarea\", label:\"Details\", path:\"summary\"} {type:\"text\", label:\"Due Date\", path:\"data.dueDate\"} ] }} {do:\"publish\", outbox:true} {do:\"trigger-event\", \"event\":\"refreshPage\"} ]} ] } view: { steps:[ {do:\"include\", \"action\":\"edit\"} ] } edit: { steps: [ {do:\"as-modal\", \"steps\": [ { do:\"edit\" form: { type:\"layout-vertical\" label:\"Edit Task\" children: [ {type:\"text\", label:\"Name\", path:\"label\"} {type:\"textarea\", label:\"Details\", path:\"summary\"} {type:\"text\", label:\"Due Date\", path:\"data.dueDate\"} {type:\"toggle\", path:\"data.complete\", options:{true-text:\"Complete\", false-text:\"Not Complete\"}} ] } options: [\"delete: /{{.StreamID}}/delete\"] } {do:\"publish\", outbox:true} {do:\"trigger-event\", \"event\":\"refreshPage\"} ]} ] } delete: { \"steps\": [ {do:\"unpublish\", outbox:true} {do:\"delete\", \"title\":\"Delete Task?\"} {do:\"trigger-event\", \"event\":\"refreshPage\"} ] } discuss: { steps: [ {do:\"as-modal\", \"steps\": [ {do:\"view-html\"} ]} ] } }\n\nJSON\n\nThe Create action adds a popup modal as a step, which then has the Name,\nDetails, and dueDate values. After it\u2019s filled out, the activity gets\npublished to an outbox, which is the standard method for dispatching in\nActivityPub. The page refreshes, and now it\u2019s possible to edit or delete the\nitem, or add a comment.\n\nWhen we put it all together, we get something that defines what data is\navailable, what actions are taken in processing that data, how it all looks,\nand what interactions are available to users. As someone who had messed around\nwith PHP, Rails, and Node apps over the years, I cannot begin to tell you how\nwild this is.\n\n## Federated Music Demo\n\nThe latest demo Ben showcased is an attempt to create an alternative to\nBandcamp. It\u2019s called Arcadium, and is designed around letting artists\ncustomize the look and feel of their band pages. It includes support for\nstreaming audio, links to other services, a custom home page, and events.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible example, and as of this writing, has a little over two\nweeks of active development time. The idea that this kind of thing is possible\nso quickly is nothing short of astonishing.\n\nBen continues to work on Arcadium, but is also seeking insight from Fediverse\nmusicians looking for another Bandcamp alternative. Tapping into an existing\ncommunity and building for their needs would be a great idea, as we\u2019ve already\nseen Bonfire do with Open Science Network.\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nIt could be argued that Emissary is for power users and developers, but I\nthink that\u2019s only part of the picture. Emissary is based on IndieWeb\nprinciples, and a big motivation for the project involves giving people the\npower to shape their Web environment into whatever they want. It\u2019s a powerful,\nintoxicating idea, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n\nI\u2019m going to download Emissary and tinker with it. Should my efforts bear\nfruit, I hope to write some guides in the near future!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\n\nTags\n\nDeveloper Tools Developers\n\nSean TilleyApril 17, 2024\n\n0 123 3 minutes read\n\n# Help us explore further!\n\nWe Distribute is an independent media publication dedicated to reporting on\nUser Empowerment, Decentralized Communication, and the future of the Internet.\nOur reporting relies on donations to sustain these efforts, and helps us pay\nour writers.
