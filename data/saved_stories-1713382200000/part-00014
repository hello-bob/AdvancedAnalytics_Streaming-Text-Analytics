Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the\ncontent's credibility:\n\nfact-checked\n\nreputable news agency\n\nproofread\n\n# AI vs humans: Influencers face competition from virtual models\n\nby Marie-Morgane LE MOEL\n\nAI offers opportunities to social media influencers but also presents risks.\n\nSocial media influencers have embraced artificial intelligence to spice up\ntheir content but they are also facing growing competition from AI-generated\nInstagramers, TikTokers and YouTubers.\n\nSporting pink hair and posing in lingerie, swimsuits or gym outfits, Aitana\nLopez has more than 300,000 followers on Instagram where she is described as a\n\"gamer at heart\" and \"fitness lover\"\u2014except she's not real.\n\nAitana was created by The Clueless, a Barcelona-based company that describes\nitself as an \"AI modeling agency\" run by \"visionaries on a mission to redefine\nthe world of influencers\".\n\nSofia Novales, project manager at The Clueless, said the \"rising costs\nassociated with human influencers\" was a reason behind the company's creation.\n\n\"Virtual models, being digital, present a more economical alternative,\"\nNovales said.\n\nAnother plus: total control over content.\n\n\"The advantages lie in unparalleled creative control, allowing seamless\ndecision-making on image, fashion, and aesthetics without the need for\nphysical photoshoots,\" Novales said.\n\nThe rise of AI has fueled concerns about the proliferation of deepfake videos\nthat could be used maliciously.\n\nMeta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, said Friday it would start putting\n\"Made with AI labels\" on AI-generated content in May.\n\nAI presents a huge business opportunity for content creators: The influencer\nmarket is expected to grow rapidly, from $16.5 billion in 2022 to nearly $200\nbillion by 2032, according to Allied Market Research.\n\n## Younger audience\n\nUsing virtual influencers is not new: Barbie already has millions of followers\non Instagram.\n\nBut they are now being used in advertisements where they can't be told apart\nfrom a real person.\n\nTake Lil Miquela, a \"19-year-old Robot living in LA\" created by a California\nagency in 2016.\n\nWith 2.6 million followers on Instagram and 3.5 million on TikTok, Lil Maqueta\nhas promoted brands as big as BMW.\n\nThe idea was to \"create something never seen before,\" the German premium\ncarmaker said in a statement to AFP.\n\n\"Attracting a younger, technology-savvy generation is for us the icing on the\ncake,\" it said.\n\nMaud Lejeune, who heads up the Paris-based digital strategy agency AD Crew,\nsaid that it isn't difficult for the public to accept AI influencers.\n\n\"It's like actors on TV: we know it isn't real yet we follow them and we find\nit interesting, it's like watching a mini-series.\"\n\nAD Crew represents more than 30 influencers, but Lejeune created her own\nvirtual influencer, Metagaya, two years ago.\n\n\"The current level of design didn't exist then. It's technical, you've got to\ndress them, take photos for the background, create a story,\" said Lejeune,\nacknowledging that Metagaya didn't turn out very well.\n\nThe rapid technological progress brought by the likes of OpenAI's Sora video\ngenerator could make it easier to create and operate realistic virtual\ninfluencers.\n\n## Deepfakes\n\nHuman influencers are also seizing on AI technology to make better videos.\n\nFrance's Charles Sterlings sees an opportunity to improve translations.\n\nHe uses different tools on platforms like HeyGen and Rask.ai to automatically\ntranslate and lip-sync his video posts into English and Spanish.\n\nSterlings also uses Deepshot, a platform that allows users to create deepfakes\nby changing the words and mouth movement of people in real videos.\n\nHe said it took him just a few minutes and a few dollars to manipulate a video\nof French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nBut Sterlings sees the technology as a competitor as well as a useful tool.\n\n\"Anyone with a phone can be an influencer. But eventually, it will be\nartificial intelligence, available 24 hours a day, and much cheaper to\ndevelop,\" he said.\n\nFor Maud Lejeune, AI can help influencers produce more content.\n\n\"It's tough to put yourself in front of the camera for a long time and certain\ncreators burn out... Maybe AI will provide a new way to create without\nexposing oneself,\" she said.\n\nThe Clueless has no qualms about its AI models taking away business from real\ninfluencers.\n\n\"We don't foresee real models becoming obsolete or replaced by AI-generated\nmodels like Aitana,\" said Novales. \"In our view, they can coexist as another\ncompetition of the industry.\"\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP\n\nCitation: AI vs humans: Influencers face competition from virtual models\n(2024, April 7) retrieved 17 April 2024 from\nhttps://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-ai-humans-competition-virtual.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
