By obfuscating the connection to LLaMA 3 in the naming,\nNvidia appears to be attempting to sidestep the open source licensing terms\nwhile benefiting from Meta's publicly released work.\n\nThis is a concerning precedent that undermines the principles of open and\nethical use of open source AI models. Nvidia needs to be held accountable for\nthis potential breach of license.\n\nI call on Nvidia to immediately either:\n\n  1. Rename your ChatQA model to properly indicate its lineage from LLaMA 3 in compliance with the terms.\n  2. Or provide a clear, public justification for how your approach does not violate the LLaMA 3 license.\n\nOpen and transparent use of open source work is crucial for building trust in\nthe rapidly evolving AI field. Nvidia must take responsibility and respect the\nlicensing terms that enable open sourcing of foundational models like LLaMA 3.\n\nI did it for the Vine.\n\nCleanCoder123\n\n12 minutes ago\n\nBy Llama 3 license: \"(B) prominently display \u201cBuilt with Meta Llama 3\u201d on a\nrelated website, user interface, blogpost, about page, or product\ndocumentation. If you use the Llama Materials to create, train, fine tune, or\notherwise improve an AI model, which is distributed or made available, you\nshall also include \u201cLlama 3\u201d at the beginning of any such AI model name.\"\n\nSo 1. Display \"Built with Meta Llama 3\u201d on page. 2. Rename model to be\nprefixed with \"Llama 3\" as stated in the Llama 3 license. @zihanliu\n\n\u00b7 Sign up or log in to comment\n\n", "frontpage": false}
