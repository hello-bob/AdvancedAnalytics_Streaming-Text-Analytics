These are my thoughts on the subject.\n\nAnshul Sao\n\nMay 07, 2024\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Minimum Viable Kubernetes\n\nanshulsao1.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nAs a CTO of an early-stage startup, I've seen my fair share of debates around\nwhether to adopt Kubernetes (K8s) or not. There's a lot of noise out there,\nwith many claiming that K8s is an overkill and advocating for simpler\nsolutions like AWS + ECS.\n\nHowever, comparing K8s (as deployed by large companies with complex setups) to\nECS is like comparing apples to oranges.\n\nNot all K8s setups need to be complex. The perception that ECS is easy while\nK8s is difficult is misleading. When starting from scratch, you'll need to put\nin effort to learn both. Sure, K8s might require a tad more effort initially,\nbut in the long run, you'll be thankful you started with it. A lot of growing\norganizations are adopting K8s, and it's not for no reason. It's a necessary\ndevil.\n\nI acknowledge that Kubernetes is hard. And the documentation is overwhelming.\nYou have to do some hard work upfront. But this complexity stems from its\nversatility \u2013 you can deploy almost any type of workload on K8s. It's like a\nSwiss Army knife \u2013 packed with tools for every occasion, but you don't need to\nuse them all at once.\n\nPeople have built vast, intricate systems on K8s, but you don't need to go\nthat far. While everything is possible on K8s, you don't need to add that much\ncomplexity from the get-go. For simple applications, you don't need to\nleverage complex and nuanced K8s features.\n\n##\n\nMinimum Viable Kubernetes\n\nThe key is to define what's necessary and what's unnecessary complexity. Take\na step back and define your \"Minimum Viable Kubernetes\" (MVK) \u2013 the minimum\nset of components and configurations required to meet your core needs reliably\nand efficiently. Do you need namespaces and permissions for every pod? Do you\nneed to be available 99.999% of the time? Do you need a complex observability\nsetup? Choose your battles carefully.\n\nUse a simple Deployment instead of a complicated StatefulSet. Use Node Port\nservices instead of setting up an Ingress controller. Don't create custom\nResourceDefinitions; stick to the built-in resources like Pods, Services, and\nDeployments. Use a hosted solution like EKS or GKE instead of installing every\ncomponent like networking, storage, and logging yourself.\n\nIn my current startup, we started with K8s from the get-go \u2013 with a very\nsimple setup. We didn't add namespaces or permissions on pod levels because\nthat wasn't needed. But as our software scaled, K8s scaled beautifully with\nit.\n\n##\n\nThat all said, why bother with K8s in the first place?\n\nCoz It\u2019s flexible. It\u2019s scalable.\n\nFirst, you have the entire flexibility. You don't get locked in. And later,\nwhen the time comes to be cloud portable, it doesn't become a six-month-long\nproject. This flexibility provides a business advantage. When you're cloud-\nflexible, you gain a competitive edge.\n\nTo illustrate, I once worked at a company heavily tied down to AWS. One of our\nenterprise clients didn't want to use AWS, and we lost the deal because moving\nto another cloud for that customer would have been a 3-4 month effort, at\nleast.\n\nA K8s setup also scales with you beautifully. Whether you want to add more\nservices, need better networking, or need to launch in multiple geographies.\nIt won\u2019t be a hassle.\n\nAnd it's easier to hire people later to manage complex setups than to move to\nK8s when you have a massive cloud footprint. If you don't want to hire, there\nare many tools in this space that help you manage K8s easily, at a fraction of\nthe cost of a DevOps engineer.\n\nIn conclusion, Kubernetes is evolved, and it can be easy if you make it so.\nStart on K8s \u2013 it's a necessary devil. Embrace its complexity judiciously, and\nget a competitive advantage as your startup grows.\n\nComment on HackerNews\n\nFollow me on Twitter\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Minimum Viable Kubernetes\n\nanshulsao1.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nStay the hell away from anything that's not cloud portable\n\nWhile starting with one cloud provider might seem like the best option,\nstartups need to be aware of the complexities and limitations of vendor lock-\nins...\n\nApr 24 \u2022\n\nAnshul Sao\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Stay the hell away from anything that's not cloud portable\n\nanshulsao1.substack.com\n\nStay The Hell Away from Anything That's Not Cloud Portable\n\nI want to talk about something that's going to sound a little debatable, but I\ndon\u2019t want others to make the same mistakes I did.
