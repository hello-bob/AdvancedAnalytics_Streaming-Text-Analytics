While some apps have to notify users immediately after an event\noccurs, others can schedule notifications strategically to notify them only on\nopportune moments. This tailoring allows apps to shorten the users\u2019\ninteraction delay. In this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive\nstudy that identified the factors that influence users\u2019 interaction delay to\ntheir smartphone notifications. We analyzed almost 10 million notifications\ncollected in-the-wild from 922 users and computed their response times with\nregard to their demographics, their Big Five personality trait scores and the\ndevice\u2019s charging state. Depending on the app category, the following\ntendencies can be identified over the course of the day: Most notifications\nwere logged in late morning and late afternoon. This number decreases in the\nevening, between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m., and at the same time exhibits the lowest\naverage interaction delays at daytime. We also found that the user\u2019s sex and\nage is significantly associated with the response time. Based on the results\nof our study, we encourage developers to incorporate more information on the\nuser and the executing device in their notification strategy to notify users\nmore effectively.\n\nKeywords:\n\nnotification; call to action; response time; HCI; mobile computing\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nNotifications are designed to signal the user and to attract the attention the\nlatter. They either remind users, provide them with information, or prompt\nthem to take action. This feature was incorporated into operating systems (OS)\nbefore the advent of the smartphone and has been part of human\u2013computer\ninteraction design for decades. In contrast to the desktop PC realm,\nnotifications in mobile computing are a much more integral part of the user\nexperience, as the smartphone is usually within the user\u2019s reach much more\noften than a traditional desktop PC [1]. Thus, the installed mobile\napplications can persuade users to interact with the smartphone virtually\nevery minute of the day and therefore increase engagement. In [2], for\nexample, the introduction of a notification mechanism, which served as a call\nto action, quintupled the frequency of data collection in their health\nservice. A notification as a call to action is particularly effective if the\nnotification offers action buttons to facilitate the user\u2019s interaction [3].\n\nHowever, for some applications, this pervasive capability to attract the\nusers\u2019 attention has become a prerequisite for reliable operation. Apps, for\nexample, where a call to action is an integral part of the functionality\n(e.g., the app category of instant messaging) require the operating system to\nprovide a reliable way to notify users in a timely manner [4]. In addition,\nless prominent app categories, such as health, also rely on a robust\nnotification mechanism [5]. Daily life research methods such as Ecological\nMomentary Assessment or Experience Sampling, for example, are often used in\nstudies in the healthcare domain and heavily utilize notifications to signal\nstudy participants [6,7,8]. Sometimes their sampling design is limited to only\na small period of time for user interaction [9].\n\nIn recent years, the reliability of the notification management\nimplementations of apps not using proprietary services offered by OS vendors\nis challenged by newly introduced battery optimization features in the Android\nOS versions 6, 7, 8, and 9. More specifically, the OS uses the interaction\nhistory of mobile applications to intelligently manage resources (i.e.,\noptimizing energy consumption). These features especially compromise the\nexecution of infrequently used apps, causing them to no longer operate as\nintended by the developer [10].\n\nIn addition to the technical requirements for a reliable notification\nmechanism, often implemented using proprietary solutions from the OS provider\n(i.e., Firebase Cloud Messaging and Apple Push Notification Service), a more\nin-depth analysis of user behavior is also beneficial to improve the\neffectiveness of notification mechanisms. For example, studies on\nnotifications have shown that users prioritize app notifications differently,\nwhich influences how they interact with the notification [4,11,12,13]. At the\nsame time, the number of notifications can vary greatly per mobile application\n[14,15] and depend on the hour of the day. Investigating these differences in\na large scale can help to improve future notification management by designing\nsmarter scheduling mechanisms. The latter, in turn, has the potential to\nimprove the user experience of an app by incorporating these usage patterns\nand helps to minimize notification intrusiveness by optimizing notification\ndelivery windows [16]. In the case of health apps, user data can help tailor\nnotifications to the user\u2019s individual health routines, increasing the\nperceived value of the app and the likelihood of future user engagement [17].\nOptimizing user engagement and preventing notification fatigue can improve\noverall app effectiveness by increasing user adherence [18].\n\nThis study pursued the following several objectives: Firstly, it aims to\nquantify user behavior in terms of notification prioritization, response\ntimes, and the impact of notification volume. This analysis will include\nvariations between app categories and time of day. Secondly, it aims to\ninvestigate how user demographics (such as age and gender), personality\ntraits, app category, and device charge level influence user response time to\na notification. By understanding user behavior patterns and preferred\ninteraction times, the study aims to contribute to the development of\nintelligent notification scheduling systems. These systems could optimize\nnotification delivery windows to minimize intrusiveness and improve the user\nexperience, leading to improved app effectiveness and user engagement. This is\nparticularly important in the area of health apps where user adherence is\ncrucial.\n\nIn this work, we provide such insights into the interaction of smartphone\nusers and their apps. Based on the TYDR dataset [19,20,21], we analyzed the\ninteraction with smartphone notifications together with other user- and\ndevice-related data to identify factors that influence the users\u2019 smartphone\ninteraction. More specifically, the core contributions of this work are as\nfollows:\n\n  * A detailed exploration of in-the-wild smartphone notifications of a large dataset;\n\n  * A comprehensive analysis of temporal differences in user interactions to determine preferred times for notification scheduling;\n\n  * The role of the users\u2019 demographics and personalty traits for notification scheduling;\n\n  * The impact of the app\u2019s category and the devices charging state on response times to smartphone notifications.\n\nThe results shall support developers to design more reliable notification\nservices and to improve the alignment of notification schedules to the common\nusers\u2019 interaction patterns by incorporating additional information.\n\nThe article is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background\ninformation on smartphone notifications, with a focus on the notification\nmechanisms offered by the Android operating system. Section 3 describes the\nmethods used to collect, process, partition, and analyze the data. In Section\n4, we present the results of our study, and in Section 5, we discuss their\nimplications. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude our work and provide an\noutlook for future research.\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\nThere are several works that investigated the user\u2019s perception of and\ninteraction with smartphone notifications. Since various mechanisms in current\nsmartphone OSs can interfere with the notification creation process, we also\nprovide a brief description of the issues as well as technical background\nknowledge in this section.\n\n#### 2.1. Notification Interaction\n\nIn several works, smartphone users showed that their behavior regarding the\ninteraction with smartphone notifications is complex and also differs in many\nregards. Ref. [1], for example, found an association between call durations\nand the number of notifications per day as well as the level of extraversion.\nOther personality traits, like neuroticism, are also positively related to\nsmartphone usage [22]. In addition to personality traits, ref. [23] examined\nhow people use smartphones depending on their age and gender. According to the\nstudy, women tend to use their phones longer than men, with an average daily\nusage time of 167 min compared to 154 min for men. Additionally, women tend to\nspend more time using communication and social apps, while men spend more time\nplaying games. These findings suggest that age and gender are significant\nfactors in determining how individuals use their smartphones. A classification\nof users in terms of notification management was also shown in [14].\nInterestingly, this is also observed in the opposite direction: user behavior\ncan be influenced by a call to action in the form of a smartphone notification\n[24]. This shows the significance of a comprehensive understanding of how\nusers interact with notifications and what influences these interactions.\n\nIn their study on notifications, Pielot et al. [15] found that participants\ntypically viewed notifications within a few minutes, but also perceived them\nas disruptive. Additionally, participants reported feeling stressed and\noverwhelmed by the number of notifications received, particularly from\nmessaging apps. Weber et al. [25], in turn, investigated how users deal with\ninterruptions from mobile notifications by manually deferring them. Previous\nresearch has focused on delivering notifications at convenient times to avoid\ninterrupting users. This study examined a different approach: an app called\n\u201cNHistory\u201d that allows users to \u2019snooze\u2019 notifications for a specific time or\nuntil a specific time. Users typically snooze notifications for short periods\nof time, usually no longer than two days. The most frequently snoozed\nnotifications include messages, calendar notifications, social media, and\nemail notifications. To identify opportune moments for user interaction, ref.\n[26] developed a machine learning model. The model significantly outperformed\nthe baseline model and predicted user engagement with recommended content\n66.6% more accurately. It uses phone usage patterns, communication activity,\nand context such as location to make these predictions. Although this approach\ntheoretically enhances user engagement with mobile notifications by sending\nthem at optimal times, the study only examined engagement with a specific\ncontent format. It is unclear whether the model can be generalized to other\nnotification types or content.\n\nTo shed light on the notification ecosystem, ref. [4] conducted, to the best\nof our knowledge, the largest study (regarding the amount of participants and\nnotifications) in the literature. Even though the study is from 2014, the\npaper provides a broad look at how people interact with notifications, as they\ncollected almost 200 million notifications of more than 40,000 users. In their\nstudy, they found that the amount of notification a user receives differs for\neach app category. WhatsApp, for example, was particularly prevalent in their\ndata, leading the authors to suspect that it was the most widely used and most\ncommon app of their study participants. The second most common app category\nwas e-mail, followed by SMS. Participants of this study, furthermore, stated\nthat notifications were important for them, especially when the notification\nis related to communication. For these reasons, the authors assume that\ncommunication remains one of the most important functions of smartphones,\ndespite the large variety of apps and usage possibilities. However, the study\ndiffers from the TYDR project in its technical structure: Ref. [4] created\nboth a mobile and a desktop application in the form of a web browser plugin\nfor Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. The desktop application served as an\nincentive for study participants to view notifications from their smartphone\non their PC. This could have an impact on the study\u2019s participant selection,\nas the use case mainly targets users of both mobile and desktop devices.\nAnother difference between [4] and our work is the availability of user\ndemographic data in TYDR. In this work, we show that additional information on\nthe app user can make an important contribution to understanding user\ninteractions with notifications.\n\nIn [27], the authors studied interruptions of smartphone users caused by\nnotifications. Following a comparable in-the-wild data collection approach to\nthe TYDR app, the authors used Mobile Crowdsensing to log data in the\nbackground and Experience Sampling Methods to collect additional data (e.g.,\nBig Five personality traits) using questionnaires. They found that the\npresentation, alert type, sender\u2013recipient relationship and characteristics of\nthe task influence the user interaction. Furthermore, they found a significant\ncorrelation between a notification\u2019s seen time and the user\u2019s extroversion and\nneuroticism [27]. In contrast to our work, they focused not on the temporal\ndelay of an interaction, but on the users\u2019 receptivity to notifications.\nFurthermore, their work does not differentiate results by app category. The\nelaborate assessment of notifications is perhaps the reason that only a\nfraction of people participated in the study (n = 20) compared to the TYDR\nstudy (n = 922).\n\nIn another work, ref. [11] analyzed in their study a larger dataset containing\nroughly 800,000 notifications from 278 users. They also found that instant\nmessaging notifications are interacted with the fastest. Furthermore, they\nshowed that a surprisingly large number of notifications were received while\nthe user is actively using the phone. When looking at the restrictions\ndescribed in Section 2.2, this directly influences the timely creation of the\nnotification. However, in contrast to our work, they focused on the daily\nnumber of notifications instead of a per-hour evaluation and, furthermore,\ncalculated conversion rates for the notifications (i.e., percentage of\ninteraction-triggering notifications). Again, the app category \u201cmessages\u201d was\nthe most interesting from the users\u2019 perspective, since this category showed\nthe highest conversion rate.\n\nTable 1 compares the research in this section with the study presented in this\npaper, highlighting the different parameters analyzed in each study. Our study\nincluded more parameters in the overall analysis, as we included demographic\ninformation, personality traits, app-related data, and battery status, while\nthe other studies used fewer parameters for their analysis.\n\nTable 1. Comparison of the parameters of the analysis between the related work\nand the study presented in this paper.\n\n#### 2.2. Technical Background\n\nSince notifications constitute an important pillar of modern applications and\ntheir pursuit for attention, current mobile OSs like Android have introduced\ncomplex features for notification management. From a technical perspective,\napplications use OS interfaces to instruct the OS to either set up background\nservices that create notifications depending on incoming messages from a\nremote entity (remote push notifications), or to schedule the creation of\nnotifications at a specific time (local push notifications).\n\nHowever, changes to the behavior of OS interfaces and newly introduced\nrestrictions on the execution of background services can be error-prone for\nall those apps that have not yet been updated or tested for a new OS version.\nFor example, ref. [28] describe in their work the behavioral change in their\nmobile crowdsensing app with different Android versions. They further describe\nthat the background data collection was affected by the introduction of\nvarious battery optimization features. Problems with these OS-related\nrestrictions regarding background services were also reported in [14]. Vendor-\nspecific OS adjustments like a battery optimization feature had such an impact\non the data collection that those datasets had to be excluded from the data\nanalysis. To avoid such issue in the TYDR app, the data collection tasks have\nbeen implemented as a foreground service (see Section 3.1).\n\nSince there is, according to [29], a certain amount of unawareness in the\ndeveloper community about OS\u2019 internal mechanisms that affect the execution of\napps and their background services, we briefly describe the following two\nprominent methods to execute background tasks on Android as well as\nlimitations posed by the OS:\n\nThe background service offers the possibility to continuously run application\ncode in the background for a longer period of time and without the user\u2019s\nawareness. This is, for example, especially useful when notifications or\nmessages need to be received from and processed by the server at all times and\nwithout the app\u2019s prior knowledge. Since background services are controlled by\nthe app and thus represent potential battery consumers from the OS\u2019\nperspective as well as possibly accessing sensitive information without the\nuser\u2019s knowledge, they are subject to some restrictions in the latest Android\nversions. In addition, background services can be stopped by the OS at any\ntime, which is why a reliable execution cannot be guaranteed for the entire\noperating time of the smartphone.\n\nThe second way to run application code in the background is through the alarm-\nbased approach. Via the alarm interface, the Android framework provides a way\nto schedule tasks in advance and execute them at a later point in time. The OS\nthen takes over the management of the tasks, which is why this variant is\nconsidered particularly energy-saving. Depending on the intended use, however,\nthis can affect the timing of the tasks since alarms are extremely dependent\non the battery optimizations integrated in the OS like Doze or App Standby\n[30,31,32,33].\n\nThe most significant restriction of the aforementioned Doze mode is that apps\ncan perform background tasks only in a periodically offered maintenance\nwindow. This restricts apps from precisely create notifications without\nincluding mechanisms that also work on Doze mode (e.g., proprietary services\nthat are excluded from OS restrictions, such as Firebase Cloud Messaging). As\nsoon as the user activates the device or charges the device, Doze mode is\nterminated and therefore all restrictions are suspended. Both, Doze and App\nStandby have large impact on applications [10] that are not designed for\noptimal operation under this execution environment. This may also be evident\nin the creation of notifications, as, for example, notifications are not\ncreated until the next maintenance window and thus will be displayed delayed.\n\n## 3\\. Methodology\n\nWe analyzed the data collected with the app TYDR (Track Your Daily Routine)\n[19,20,21] to better understand differences in the usage behavior of app users\nand support future apps in their effort for strategic notification scheduling.\nTYDR (Google Play Store entry:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dynamic_project.tydr\n(accessed on 23 February 2024)) is an app developed for research purposes for\nAndroid smartphones that used the mobile crowdsensing methodology to collect\nsensor data and smartphone usage statistics as well as pose questionnaires on\nthe personality of the users. From a user\u2019s perspective, TYDR shows aggregate\nstatistics about the user\u2019s smartphone use. From our research\u2019s perspective,\nwe collected these data in order to analyze smartphone usage behavior. When\nopening the TYDR app, the user can choose which data he or she is willing to\nlet the app track and display statistics about.\n\nFor this work, we used a subset of the TYDR dataset, containing notification\nmetadata and battery data. In addition, we used the gathered information about\nthe users\u2019 devices as well as the responses to a demographic and a personality\ntraits questionnaire. The data were collected between October 2018 and October\n2020.\n\n#### 3.1. Data Collection\n\nFrom the user\u2019s perspective, in order to let TYDR collect notification\nmetadata, he/she has to allow TYDR to access notification data, and, in turn,\nsee aggregate statistics about how many notifications were triggered by which\napp. Once the permission is given, we store metadata for each notification in\na local database, and periodically upload it to our backend. For more details\non the implementation and privacy aspects, please refer to [19,20,21].\n\nTo track the interactions of users with their smartphones, TYDR implemented a\nso-called notification listener that logs all notification metadata, e.g., app\nname, timestamp of the appearance and disappearance of the notification. The\nnotification listener was implemented as a foreground service instead of a\nbackground service with a permanent notification to indicate the ongoing data\ncollection. This was necessary in order to prevent the OS from stopping the\nTYDR app listeners (cf. Section 2.2) and thus not missing any app interaction.\nIn order to preserve the users\u2019 privacy, all fields containing private data\n(e.g., title or content of the notification) were only recorded in hashed\nform.\n\nThe battery-related data were gathered using the BatteryManager interface of\nthe Android OS. The BatteryManager uses broadcasts to signal any changes in\nthe batteries\u2019 charging state. In addition to the charging state, the current\nbattery level was also logged. Additional data regarding the executing\nenvironment (i.e., smartphone model name), demographic information of the user\n(e.g., sex, age), or other user-related information were collected either\nusing programmable interfaces that were provided by the OS or by asking the\nuser to fill out questionnaires.\n\n#### 3.2. Data Preprocessing\n\nWe deduplicated the battery and notification data, since the TYDR app logs\ndata on every status change (e.g., due to an app-triggered update). To\nminimize anomalies in the Android-related data, we searched the smartphone\ndataset for smartphone updates. To be more precise, we excluded data from\nusers who updated their operating system while using the TYDR app to ensure\nuser-level data integrity. With the now cleaned data, we were able to\ncalculate the following metric:\n\nInteraction Delay (IDL) describes the temporal difference between the\nnotification being displayed and the notification being removed from the\nnotification bar (by clicking or dismissing).\n\nThe IDL was calculated as an integer to the second. We removed all records\nwhose IDL was not greater than zero, as such short interaction times likely\nindicate automatic removal rather than human\u2013computer interaction.\n\nWe then merged the battery data with the notification data based on timestamps\nand user identifier. Notification data and battery data might not be recorded\nat the same time. In the merging process, to enrich the notification data, we\nallowed for a time difference of 10 min between notification timestamp and\nbattery recording. We expect the battery level not to change significantly in\nsuch a short period of time and allow for significantly more battery level\nannotation.\n\nSince our analysis is dedicated to the temporal dynamics of notification\ncreation and interaction, we have to distinguish between fixed notifications\nand notifications as a call to action. In order to disregard fixed\nnotifications (and faulty records), we set an upper bound for the calculated\nIDL of one day. This limit excludes only a minimal number of 6496 records\n(0.06%) from the analysis and has no significant impact on the calculations of\nthe analysis.\n\nEach record can be associated with a device. Through this relationship, the\nrecords were enriched with additional information about the device (e.g.,\nAndroid version and device model ID). To group the apps, we defined a list of\n15 categories and manually sorted each app into one of the following\ncategories: Health, Finance, Outdoor, Shopping, Educational, Self-\nOrganization, File Processing, Gaming, News & Entertainment, Social Media,\nMessaging, System-/OS-related, Misc, Warning, and less than 10 unique users.\n\nFinally, we removed all records that were either not complete (i.e., have\nattributes without information) or in the app categories Misc, File\nProcessing, and less than 10 unique users. Doing so, we ensured on the one\nhand to only compare datasets containing a minimum amount of users, and on the\nother to exclude apps that are neither using notification as reminders nor as\na call to action. For example, most notifications in the app category File\nProcessing originate from cloud and office apps that use notifications to\ncommunicate the status of an ongoing task (e.g., file upload). We excluded\nthese records because our purpose in this paper is to analyze human\u2013computer\ninteractions.\n\nIn addition to the records described above, we included the time of the day in\nhours (12 a.m.\u201311 p.m.) when the notification appeared, the battery level at\nthe moment of the notification appearance, as well as whether the smartphone\nwas charging at the moment (yes/no).\n\n#### 3.3. Datasets\n\nAfter the data processing, the dataset contained 9,894,656 notifications from\n922 unique users. In the following, this dataset is called DS1. In addition,\nwe formed a second dataset (DS2) containing only data from users who have also\nfilled out a demographic questionnaire (58%) and a third dataset (DS3) with\nusers that filled out a demographic as well as a Big Five personality traits\nquestionnaire (45%). In Table 2, we give an overview about the datasets. DS2\ncontains the users that filled out a demographic questionnaire. Overall, 84%\nof users are male () and 16% are female (). The mean age of users is 35.2\nyears with a standard deviation of 10.6 years. DS3 contains the users that\nadditionally filled out a Big Five personality trait questionnaire (BFI-2,\n[34,35]). The measured Big Five personality traits of TYDR user are comparable\nto those of the population average with only minor differences [21].\n\nTable 2. Overview of the used datasets. DS1 contains only device- and app-\nrelated data. DS2 contains filled out demographic questionnaires. In DS3,\nusers also filled out an additional personality questionnaire. Therefore, DS3\nis a subset of DS2 and DS2 is a subset of DS1. Percentages have been rounded.\n\n#### 3.4. Data Analysis\n\nWe first used descriptive statistics to present the distribution of the\ndifferent datasets and to describe the socio-demographic characteristics of\nthe respondents. We calculated the median, mean, and standard deviation of the\nIDL depending on the following factors: app category, time of day in hours,\ncharging, battery level, sex (only DS2 and DS3; sex refers to the binary sex\nassigned at birth), age (only DS2 and DS3), and Big Five personality traits\n(only DS3). Regarding time of day in hours, for all analyses, we truncated all\nlocal time values after the specification of the hour. In other words, we only\nconsidered the number of hours and did not round.\n\nWe then conducted a bivariate analysis of the data using a compared mean test\nto compare the mean of the IDL of different groups. More specifically, we\ndetermined whether the associated means of the various specifications of one\nvariable were significantly different from each other. Thereby, we applied\ndifferent kinds of tests depending on the characteristic of the variable. For\ncategorical variables, such as the Sex or App category, we used a t-test, if\nthe variable has only two categories (e.g., charging), or ANOVA (analysis of\nvariance), if the variables has more than two categories (e.g., app category).\nFor continuous variables, such as battery level, the Spearman correlation was\napplied. To measure the significance, we chose a significance level of 5%. In\nthe subsequent multiple linear regression model, all variables for which the\np-value was less than 0.05 in the bivariate analysis, were included to model\nthe linear relationship between those explanatory variables and the IDL. The\nmodel predicts the IDL based on the values of the explanatory variables.\nBefore the regression was conducted, the important requirements for this\nanalysis, such as the absence of multicollinearity, have also been reviewed\nand confirmed. In order to include the categorical variables in the linear\nregression model as well, they had to be transformed into dummy variables. A\ndummy variable is a binary variable that can take only the values 0 or 1,\nrepresenting the observation of a characteristic (e.g., being male was equal\nto 1 or not being male was equal to 0). For each categorical variable, which\ncan take on k different values, dummy variables were included in the\nregression model to avoid perfect collinearity. Thus, the specifications not\ncharging, Messaging, as well as female are used as reference categories within\nthe individual features. All analyses were two-sided with a significance level\nof .\n\n## 4\\. Results\n\nThe characteristics of the users and the distribution of interaction delays in\nminutes are summarized in Table 3. DS1 included 9,894,656 notifications from\n922 users, DS2 included 5,794,439 notifications from 537 users and included\nfactors such as sex and age, and DS3 included 4,396,241 notifications from 417\nusers and included the variables from DS2 as well as the Big Five personality\ntraits.\n\nTable 3. Descriptive statistical analysis of DS1, DS2, and DS3. Demographic\ninformation is only available in DS2 and DS3. Data on Big Five personality\ntraits are only available in DS3.\n\nRegarding the optimizations and limitations introduced in Android 6 and 7 (see\nSection 2.2), we analyzed the Android version of the devices. Over 70% of the\ndataset was collected from devices running Android 8, followed by Android 9\nand Android 7 as the second and third most common versions, respectively. The\nremaining data accounted for less than 0.2% of DS1.\n\nWhen examining the apps that trigger notifications, it is evident that the\nquantity of records gathered differs significantly among the app categories\n(see Table 3). More than half of the data can be attributed to the Messaging\ngroup, which comprises both messenger and email apps (e.g., Telegram Messenger\nand Google Mail), accounting for a substantial portion of the records in DS1.\nAccording to Table 4, the messenger app WhatsApp on its own accounts for 35%\nof DS1.\n\nTable 4. The top 10 apps with the most notifications in DS1 (IDL in minutes).\n\nTable 3 displays both the mean and median IDL for the apps in our dataset. The\nmean is the arithmetic average and represents the central tendency of the\ndata. However, since outliers (i.e., notifications not responded to for a long\ntime) are not uncommon in mobile crowdsensing studies, we also calculate the\nmedian to provide an additional measure for data understandability. The median\nrepresents the middle value of an ordered dataset (i.e., the IDL of 50% of all\nnotifications is lower). Therefore, when comparing the median IDL of two app\ncategories, we obtain a less biased view of the data.\n\nThe average IDL of WhatsApp (mean = 4.71; median = 0.23) is relatively low\ncompared to other frequently used apps. It is important to note that the\nMessaging app category includes apps associated with social networks, such as\nFacebook Messenger. The distinction between social media apps and messenger\napps is based on their main function, such as instant messaging, rather than\ntheir affiliation, such as Facebook.\n\nAlthough the median for similar apps in the Messaging app category, such as\nTelegram (package name: com.telegram.messenger) or Facebook Messenger (package\nname: com.facebook.orca), is comparatively low, their means differ\nsignificantly. Email applications such as Google Mail (package name:\ncom.google.android.gm) and Microsoft\u2019s email app Outlook (package name:\ncom.microsoft.office.outlook) exhibit significantly higher mean values.\n\nThe category with the second-largest number of apps is System_OS, with over 2\nmillion records (23.5%). For instance, Android\u2019s download manager is part of\nthis group, ranking third among the top 10 apps in DS1. Following the two\nlargest app categories, there is a significant decrease in notification\nfrequency: the third-largest group, News_Entertainment, accounts for only 5%,\nand all other groups each have a share of less than 5% (see Table 3).\n\nFigure 1 also illustrates the large differences in the number of records per\ngroup. It shows the number of notifications for each hour of the day and app\ncategory. Blue cells indicate a large number of records, yellow cells indicate\nonly a few data, and green cells indicate everything in between. When\ncomparing the app categories Messaging and Gaming, Messaging showed 66 times\nmore data usage per hour between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Large differences are also\nnoticeable in less populated categories such as Entertainment and\nSelf_Organization. The dataset also indicates that fewer notifications are\ngenerated at night due to reduced interaction with the smartphone during these\ntimes. For instance, in the Messaging app category, the number of records\nincreases thirteen-fold between 3 a.m. and 6 p.m, while categories like\nWarning only show a minor increase during the same period.\n\nFigure 1. Records of each app category in DS1 per time of day in hours.\n\nThe median IDL also varies greatly depending on the app category. Figure 2\ndisplays the distribution of the IDL throughout the day and per app category.\nWhile some categories exhibit less variation across the day (e.g., Educational\nand Messaging), there is significant variation in categories such as Gaming\nand Social_Media. An increase in IDL often occurs at night, particularly\nbetween 1 and 6 a.m., with a peak at 3 or 4 a.m. Figure 2 also shows an\nopposing trend for some app categories, such as Finance or Health.\n\nFigure 2. Median IDL of each app category in DS1 per time of day in hours.\n\nTo investigate the association between the mean and median IDL and the record\ncount, we calculated their z-scores. This allows for the comparison of\ndifferent measures and a better observation of fluctuations over time, as the\nz-scores indicate the difference between a value and the mean in terms of\nstandard deviations. The z-scores were grouped by time of day in hours and are\nshown in Figure 3. This calculation enabled us to identify peaks throughout\nthe day, indicating times with above-average values and potentially high IDL\nfor new notifications, as well as periods with average or below-average IDL.\nThe mean and median IDL show opposing trends. The lowest z-score for the\nmedian IDL is at 2 a.m., while the highest z-score for the mean IDL is at 3\na.m. (see Figure 3, 1). The third z-score for the record count indicates that\nthe number of notifications is below average during these nighttimes. The\nnumber of notifications increases and is above average at around 7:30 a.m.\n(see Figure 3, 2). Although the median IDL also increases until 8 a.m. (see\nFigure 3, 3), the mean IDL decreases to a below-average value. After 8 p.m.,\nthe median IDL decreases to an average value while the notification count\nincreases until 11 a.m. (see Figure 3, 4) and remains a relatively stable\nabove-average value until 6 p.m. (see Figure 3, 5). Between 7:30 p.m. and\n10:30 p.m., the median IDL and record count are below average, making it a\npromising time for user notifications.\n\nFigure 3. Z-scores for the mean IDL (gray), median IDL (red), and the record\ncount (orange) per time of day in hours in DS1.\n\nThe bivariate analysis (see Table 3) revealed a significant difference in the\nIDL among various app categories (p-value < 0.001). The smallest IDL was\nobserved for Warning notifications (mean = 2.71; median = 0.07), while the\nhighest IDL was observed for Gaming notifications with a median of 12.75 (mean\n= 64.1). The median interaction delays for the Messaging, Outdoor, Shopping,\nand System_OS app categories were all less than one minute.\n\nThe Spearman correlation indicates a significant association between the time\nof day in hours and the IDL, as well as between the battery level and the IDL\n(see Table 3). Although the number of notifications between 12 and 5 a.m. was\nrelatively small, the median IDL during this period was the lowest, averaging\n0.18 min. When examining the battery level, it is evident that the IDL\ndecreases as the battery level decreases. The mean IDL for low battery levels\nis 13.41 with a median of 0.27, while the mean IDL for high battery levels is\n19.53 with a median of 0.40. Most of the time, the smartphones were not\ncharging (75%). However, the device\u2019s charging status is significantly\nassociated with the IDL. When the device is charging, the IDL tends to be\nsmaller (mean = 14.93; median = 0.2) compared to when it is not charging (mean\n= 17.04; median = 0.42). Figure 4 (red: charging = yes; gray: charging = no)\nillustrates the difference between the two charging states, showing a steady\ndistance between the two median values for the IDL for each battery level.\n\nFigure 4. Median IDL for each battery level during charging and battery\noperation in DS1 (non-stacked areas).\n\nAll significant features from the bivariate analyses were included in the\nsubsequent multiple linear regression. The results, presented in Table 5,\nconfirm the previous findings that a higher battery level is associated with a\nhigher IDL, while the IDL is smaller later in the day. On average, the\ninteraction delay decreases by 0.43 min for every additional hour during the\nday. Additionally, an increase of 1% in battery results in an average delay\nincrease of 0.1 min. On average, the IDL differs depending on whether the\nsmartphone is charging or not by 2.8 min. Additionally, the app category is\ncorrelated with the IDL value. For instance, notifications categorized as\nWarning have an IDL that is 8.9 min less than those categorized as Messaging.\nThe IDL of all other categories is higher compared to messaging.\n\nTable 5. Results of the linear regression for DS1, DS2, and DS3.\n\n#### 4.1. The Role of Sex and Age\n\nFor DS2, we recalculated the z-scores for the mean and median IDL, as well as\nfor the notification count. The distribution and results were comparable to\nthose of DS1. Therefore, the bivariate analyses of the factors already\nincluded in DS1 remained significant. The distributions within the features\ndid not differ much from those in DS1. In addition to the analyses of DS1, we\nalso included the association of sex and age with the IDL. Both the t-test for\nsex and the Spearman correlation for age were significant, indicating that\nthere are statistically significant differences between their IDL means.\n\nSince sex and age had a significant effect on IDL, we examined the app\ncategories for deviations. Table 6, illustrates the findings for both sexes.\nMost app categories have comparable IDLs for female and male users with only\nminor differences. However, the same app categories (e.g., News_Entertainment,\nFinance, and Gaming) showed considerable deviations, which is due to the\nheterogeneous distribution of the data (see Table 6, SD). We also investigated\nin the number of notifications per app category depending on age (see Figure 5\nand Figure 6). It was found that younger individuals, particularly those aged\n18 to 29, receive a higher number of notifications for the app categories\nMessaging and Social_Media compared to older age groups. Additionally, the\nnumber of notifications in the News_Entertainment category is also higher\namong younger individuals than in other age groups. All age groups have\nsimilar percentages of applications for communication, as shown in Figure 5.\nSome deviations, such as the noticeably higher number of notifications in the\ncategories of Finance and Health, are particularly evident among individuals\naged over 62.\n\nFigure 5. Percentage of app categories per age group in DS2.\n\nFigure 6. Number of notifications of female and male users for each app\ncategory in DS2.\n\nTable 6. IDL in minutes per app category & sex in DS2.\n\nTable 3 shows the differences between male and female users for the entire\ndataset. Female users have a longer median reaction time to notifications\n(median = 0.43) compared to male users (median = 0.33). Additionally, the\naverage interaction delay increases with age. In DS2, the mean IDL for the\n18\u201329 age group and the 45\u201362 age group differs by approximately 9 min. The\nmedian time differs slightly, with 0.30 min for the 18\u201329 age group and 0.55\nminutes for the 45\u201362 age group. The data indicate that 37.2% of the sample\nbelonged to the 18\u201329 age group, while 23.0% belonged to the 45\u201362 age group.\nFurthermore, Figure 7 illustrates that the distribution of notifications\nduring the day was similar across all age groups. Additionally, the data\nreveal that individuals under the age of 45 receive more notifications at\nnight. Especially for the age group of 45\u201362 years, there is a clear decrease\nin the number of notifications at 10 p.m.\n\nFigure 7. Number of notifications of each age group throughout the day in DS2\n(stacked areas).\n\nFigure 8 shows the median IDL in minutes for each age group throughout the\nday. The age groups of 18\u201329 years and 30\u201344 years exhibited few differences,\nwith the exception of a peak at 7 a.m. in the 18\u201329 age group (see Figure 8,\n2). Additionally, the median IDL in the 18-29 age group only increases from 5\na.m. onward, in contrast to all other age groups (see Figure 8, 1). Users in\nthe 45\u201362 age group show an increased median during nighttime and especially\nin the morning compared to younger users. Figure 8 also showed multiple peaks\nfor users above 62 years, having the largest peak at 6 a.m. Since we have only\nlittle data for this age group, only 0.7% of DS2 to be precise (see Table 3),\nthese peaks represent the outliers of individual users rather than being\nrepresentative. Therefore, we have depicted the area of users over 62 years\nold transparently. As all features, including age and sex, were significantly\nassociated with IDL in this dataset, they were all included as explanatory\nvariables in the multiple linear regression. The regression results are\ncomparable to those of DS1. The battery level and time of day values are\nconsistent with the regression model for DS1. However, the charging value\ndiffers slightly (\u22123.87 compared to \u22122.80), while the values of the different\napp categories deviate significantly from those in DS1 (e.g., Finance: DS1:\n20.34, DS2: 8.74). In addition to the previously mentioned variables, the\nnewly added factors of age and sex are also significantly associated with the\nIDL. On average, a person who is one year older requires 0.39 more minutes to\nreact to a notification. Additionally, male users require more time to react\nthan female users.\n\nFigure 8. Median interaction delay (IDL) of each age group throughout the day\nin DS2 (stacked areas). Data of users older than 62 are presented\ntransparently because only little data were available (0.7% of DS2).\n\n#### 4.2. The Role of the Big Five Personality Traits\n\nDS3 showed similar z-scores for the mean and median IDL, as well as a\ncomparable notification distribution throughout the day when compared to DS2.\nThe Big Five personality trait scores were also included in DS3, in addition\nto the factors included in DS2. In the bivariate analysis, all Big Five\npersonality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness,\nand Neuroticism) are significantly and positively related to the IDL. This\nmeans that a higher score in these individual personality traits is associated\nwith a higher IDL. To examine the connection between these factors and the\nIDL, we used the Spearman correlation. The measure resulted in a p-value <\n0.001 for all five personality traits, indicating statistical significance.\n\nIndividuals with higher scores in openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism\ntend to have less interaction delay compared to those with lower scores. For\ninstance, those in the top half of openness score have a median interaction\ndelay of 0.28, while those in the bottom half have a median interaction delay\nof 0.4. The median of both halves of the extraversion score is identical.\nHowever, individuals with a score in the upper half of agreeableness exhibit a\nhigher interaction delay than those in the bottom half (median = 0.45 compared\nto 0.25).\n\nThe multivariate regression model, which includes the Big Five personality\nfeatures, confirms the results of the bivariate analysis. All newly added\nvariables, except for extraversion, are significantly associated with IDL. On\naverage, a one-point increase on the neuroticism scale is linked to a 1.44\nhigher IDL, whereas a one-point increase in openness, conscientiousness, and\nagreeableness raises the IDL by less than half a minute.\n\n## 5\\. Discussion\n\nThe analysis of the TYDR dataset showed that there is a significant dependency\nbetween the IDL and the app category. In the case of the category Gaming, for\nexample, the difference in the mean IDL compared to the category Warning was\nover an hour (63.36 min). A deviation of interaction times between app\ncategories was also found in the works [4,14,15]. In all works, the app\ncategory Messaging (called \u201cMessenger\u201d in [4,15] and \u201cSMS & IM\u201d in [14]) also\nshowed a lower interaction delay than the other categories. This difference in\nbehavior may indicate that users saw the notifications and intentionally did\nnot respond to them. Especially if users prioritize notification differently\ndepending on the app category. In [4], users are asked to give feedback on\nnotifications and also to prioritize them. It turns out that messenger apps\nwere given the highest priority in this study. Moreover, the interaction time\n(in [4] called \u201cclick time\u201d) and the importance of notifications showed a\nnegative correlation and, therefore, confirms the results of our analysis with\nregard to the app category.\n\nThe distribution of app categories is also similar to works [4,14,15]: the\ncategory of messaging apps contains the most notification data. However, our\nwork stands out from other works because we extracted the number and\ndifference in notifications per time of day more precisely than, for example,\nref. [15]. Moreover, we identified in all three datasets that the IDL is above\naverage in the morning hours (see Figure 3, 3). A similar trend is shown in a\nstudy of [25]: they found that highest number of notifications per hour are\nposted in the morning, and the lowest at night and in the evening.\nInterestingly, their application allowed users to snooze notifications and the\nhighest number of snoozes per hour was also in the morning. We therefore\npropose to schedule notifications in the evening, since our data showed that\nboth the amount of notifications and the median IDL is decreasing after 8 p.m.\n(see Figure 3, 6,7). The results of the linear regression support this\nfinding, as IDL is negatively correlated with time of day and decreases\nthroughout the day.\n\nUsing this insight, apps that require a short IDL (e.g., therapy apps that\nrequire an action within a short time frame [9]) can optimize their\nnotification scheduling. Especially, when apps are using an alarm-based\napproach (see Section 2.2) to implement local push notifications. This\napproach is generally more robust than remote push notifications, because of\nthe network restrictions that are part of the battery optimizations of current\nAndroid operating system versions [36].\n\nTo further support the scheduling of future notifications, we calculated the\nz-scores for the mean and median IDL as well as for the notification count.\nThis supported our understanding of the average IDL per hour. More precisely,\nusing the mean z-score, we were able to identify points in time with, on\naverage, high or low IDL (see Figure 3, high: 1; low: between 2 and 7). The\nsame is the case for the median z-scores, which offered us a better view on\nthe average IDL with less dispersion due to outliers. Time points with high\nmedian z-scores but only average mean z-scores (i.e., at these time points the\nIDL was increased above average and this was not due to outliers) show\nintervals at which no notification should be sent (see Figure 3, 3). Combined\nwith the third z-score for the record count (i.e., the average amount of\nnotifications), we could identify a time span with low mean and median\nz-scores and thereby decreasing notification count (see Figure 3, between 6\nand 7). This indicates that the users were active and reacted very quickly at\nthese points in time. Furthermore, because of the decreasing notification\ncount, users are maybe more likely to perceive new notifications.\n\nLooking at Table 5 and Figure 4, the charging state is also linked to the IDL.\nIn Figure 4, the continuous distance visualizes the existence of an\ninfluencing factor with respect to the IDL. In case of the charging state,\nthere are technical as well as behavioral reasons for this. On the technical\nside, the absence of battery optimizations (as described in Section 2.2) has a\npositive effect on the background execution of apps. Background services do\nnot have to wait for a maintenance window to receive and create push\nnotifications. Another possible reason could be the user\u2019s behavior during the\ncharging process. If the user charges their smartphone at daytime or during\ntheir waking phase, the probability that the user will also use the smartphone\nis high. Interestingly, in Figure 4 1, an increased IDL difference is shown\nbetween 98% and 100% battery level. This difference might be caused by the\nfact that after charging the smartphone, a user starts another activity (e.g.,\ngoing to work). This possible activity would match the increased IDL in the\nmorning shown in Figure 8. It is also possible that the user is more likely to\ncharge the smartphone next to him/her or look at the smartphone more often in\norder not to miss a notification. Because the OS does not restrict any app\u2019s\nrequest for resources during charging, an accumulation of interruptions caused\nby notifications (apps no longer have to wait for the next maintenance window\nto create or receive notifications) is also a possible reason for a lower IDL\n(see Section 2.2).\n\nDemographic information about the user, especially age, was significantly\nassociated with the IDL. A comparable association between age and the\nnotification interaction is described in [26], where the authors developed an\nalgorithm using machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of user\ninteraction with a smartphone notification. For their computation, they used a\nsample with similar age distribution (mean = 37.85; std = 11.01) to our sample\n(DS2: mean = 35.04; std = 10.67). In contrast to their work, we did not\ncompute the likelihood of a user interaction, but tried to predict the\ndifference in time between displaying a notification in the notification bar\nand its removal. Consequently, we also identified age as an important factor,\nbut did not reproduce the positive correlation between age and user\ninteraction because all notifications without interaction were removed from\nour dataset during data cleaning (see Section 3.2).\n\nAnother demographic information, the user\u2019s sex, is associated with the IDL.\nFemales tend to have a slightly larger median IDL compared to males. On the\nother hand, the mean IDL is slightly larger compared to males. These\ndifferences might be due to varying levels of IDL within sex groups, as\nfemales show fewer outliers with respect to IDL. Another possible reason is\nthe unequal distribution of data between men and women (see Table 3). Since\naccording to [23], daily smartphone use for males is lower compared to\nfemales, this difference in smartphone use could lead to a lower average IDL\nfor females.\n\nWhen we had a closer look at the Big Five personality traits, the regression\nanalysis showed that people who have a higher neuroticism score also have a\nhigher IDL on average. Neurotic people are defined as rather emotionally\nunstable, impulsive people, who tend to get angry fast and perceive life\nnegatively [37]. Other studies have found that neuroticism is significantly\npositively related to higher smartphone [22] and social media usage [38] or\neven to a smartphone addiction [39,40]. While more neurotic users use their\nphone more, their IDL was higher. Even if someone has a higher smartphone\nusage, he/she does not necessarily respond to notifications more quickly.\n\n#### 5.1. Implications for Notification Scheduling\n\nThe objective was to utilize minimal data, commonly available in most apps, to\nidentify patterns in the user\u2019s smartphone interaction and facilitate\nintelligent notification planning. These findings can be directly applied to\nthe creation of intelligent notification systems. Intelligent notification\nsystems can utilize our results to calculate the expected IDL. We would like\nto point out that the parameters for the planning algorithms are available at\ndifferent times. The app category, notification volume, and demographic data,\nsuch as gender and age as well as the Big Five personality traits are examples\nof data that are known prior to operation. They are suitable for calculating\nand defining individual tendencies for notifications a priori. On the other\nhand, there are parameters that are only available to the notification system\nduring operation and are therefore suitable for ad hoc calculations. These\ninclude, for example, the battery level or the state of charge. The time of\nday is a parameter that can be used both for a priori calculations (e.g., to\ndetermine time periods) and for ad hoc calculations.\n\nThe study showed that the number of notifications and the IDL are\nsignificantly affected by the app category and time of day. Scheduled\nnotifications for apps from categories that are expected to have a higher IDL,\naccording to our analysis, can use the regression results to choose a more\nappropriate time to send notifications to the user, thereby reducing the IDL.\nFor example, our analysis indicates to schedule notifications in the evening,\nsince our data showed that both the amount of notifications and the median IDL\ndecreases after 8 p.m.\n\nFurthermore, the IDL is significantly influenced by the user\u2019s age, gender,\ncharging state, and current battery level. Health apps can use user\ndemographic data to personalize notifications. For instance, older\nindividuals, who typically have a higher IDL, could receive scheduled\nnotifications earlier to perform actions, such as data entry, within a certain\ntime interval. This is especially important in studies that use daily life\nmethods, when a person\u2019s momentary state is to be recorded in a short time\ninterval [9]. The same applies to gender, as men tend to have a higher IDL. To\nsupport the development of intelligent notification systems, developers are\nalso encouraged to monitor the current battery level and state of charge and\nintegrate them into their calculations.\n\n#### 5.2. Limitations\n\nIn this work, the time between creation and removal of a notification from the\nnotification bar was measured to reflect user response time. As discussed\nearlier, users prioritize notifications differently, suggesting an impact on\nIDL. Since this study used data from a mobile crowdsensing app, real-world\nmeasurements were used for evaluation without including the participants\u2019\nprioritization. The participants of the TYDR study (i.e., app users) were not\ninstructed to respond as quickly as possible, but rather real-world behavior\nwas measured. This results in a high external validity (a strength of mobile\ncrowdsensing research [5]), but at the cost of the internal validity. In other\nwords, we cannot differentiate whether a high IDL is caused by technical\nissues or the app user\u2019s individual prioritization of apps without the\ncollection of more data (e.g., screen activation). To achieve this, there are\nspecialized tools to research both app and user behavior [10].\n\nAnother limitation of this study is the lack of more notification metadata in\nthe TYDR dataset. In newer Android versions, it is possible to get the reason\nof the notification removal from the OS via the notification listener (see\nSection 3.1). This field returns an encoded value with the information if, for\nexample, the user or the app itself removed the notification from the\nnotification bar [41]. This information is important to further clean the\ndataset and especially to implement an improved detection mechanism for\npermanent notifications or progress indicators. In the present work, this\ninformation was not available, so we could only process the data by making\nassumptions (see Section 3.2). In addition, this would allow more detailed\nanalytics on how the user interacts with the notifications (e.g., click and\ndismiss rates for notifications per app category).\n\nThus, there is more dispersion in the data, which can be seen in Table 3 by\nthe difference between the arithmetic mean and the median as well as the\nstandard deviation of the IDL. In addition, knowing whether a notification was\ntriggered locally or remotely would help us better understand the impact of\nbattery optimizations in Android smartphones. This information could be used\nto improve the notification systems for services with a need for a short IDL.\nFurthermore, in contrast to [27], we did not differentiate between individual\nand group messages in our analysis of the app category Messenger.\n\nAdditionally, because we used real-world data, the number of the individual\nvalues a variable can take on, diverges. For example, considerably more male\nthan female users are included in this analysis and, in contrast to the number\nof messaging notifications, the number of Finance or Gaming notifications is\nrather small. We partially addressed this issue by only including categories\nwith a sufficient number of notifications and/or enough unique users (more\nthan 10, see Section 3.2).\n\nThe same applies with the age distribution of the users. The majority of\nnotifications was collected from users younger than 62 years. Only 0.7% of\nnotifications in DS2 and 1.0% of notifications in DS3 can be assigned to users\nolder than 62 years (see Table 3). In Figure 7, the distribution of the data\nover the day is shown. Notifications from users older than 62 years are\ncolored in dark blue. Because these notifications are only a fraction of the\nentire dataset, the gained information (e.g., IDL of age group > 62 in Figure\n8) must be interpreted with caution. The influence of individual outliers is\nmuch more pronounced with a small user base, so that the significance of the\ndata is reduced.\n\nIn addition, we did not include users\u2019 geographic or cultural origin in the\nanalysis in this study. The TYDR app was available worldwide on the Google\nPlay Store and, therefore, any cultural differences may be part of the\ndataset. An analysis of notifications for such differences is part of future\nwork.\n\nFinally, we would like to note that this study only includes data from users\nwith an Android smartphone. Since interaction with operating systems may\ndiffer in terms of notifications (e.g., due to different implementations of\nbattery optimization features), the results are not directly applicable to\nusers of other operating systems, such as Apple\u2019s iOS.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nIn this work, we presented a detailed study on smartphone notifications to\nidentify influencing factors on the interaction delay. The used data are part\nof the TYDR dataset and contains almost 10 million notifications that were\ncollected in-the-wild from 922 unique users.\n\nWe found that the number of notification is significantly depending on the app\ncategory and the time of the day. For example, the number of notifications\ncreated by the app WhatsApp on its own accounts for 35% of the data, and\nshowed a thirteen-fold increase between 3 a.m. and 6 p.m. Furthermore, our\ncomprehensive analysis of the temporal difference between notification\ncreation and removal in the notification bar showed a significant negative\nassociation between the interaction delay and the time of day. In other words,\nresponse time decreases over the course of the day. We thus propose to, if\npossible, notify users in the evening between 8 and 11 p.m.\n\nWe used additional data provided by either the users (e.g., sex and age) or\nthe device (e.g, battery level) to identify more factors that possibly\ninfluence the interaction delay. Our analysis showed a significant positive\nassociation between the interaction delay and the battery level as well as\nage. In other words, younger users tend to interact faster, and app users on\nfully charged devices exhibit a higher IDL than on devices with lower battery\nlevels. We also found that males tend to have higher interaction delays than\nfemales.\n\nSince the majority of participants in our study were under the age of 62, and\nthe results for those over 62 were based on a smaller sample size, it would be\nbeneficial to conduct further studies, particularly with older participants.\nAdditionally, it is possible that other smartphone parameters provided to\ndevelopers may impact user interaction. The incorporation of the latter into\nthe development of smart notification systems could assist in tailoring the\nplanning and ad hoc scheduling of survey and notification periods to the user.\nThis is particularly relevant in the case of ecological momentary assessment\nor experience sampling apps.\n\nWe highly encourage researchers and developers to incorporate more information\nabout the user and the smartphone in their notification scheduling algorithms,\nsince additional factors like the Big Five personality traits or the devices\u2019\ncharging state also correlated with the interaction delay. In the pursuit for\nstrategic notification planning, our contribution can help to identify\nopportune moments for future user notifications.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.S. and F.B.; data curation, M.S., L.M. and F.B.; formal\nanalysis, M.S. and L.M.; investigation, M.S. and L.M.; methodology, M.S., L.M.\nand F.B.; resources, M.R., R.P. and F.B.; supervision, F.B.; visualization,\nM.S. and L.M.; writing\u2014original draft, M.S., L.M. and F.B.; writing\u2014review &\nediting, M.S., L.M., M.R., R.P. and F.B.
