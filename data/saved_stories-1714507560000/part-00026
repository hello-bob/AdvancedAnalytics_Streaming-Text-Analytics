(Image credit: NASA)\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory at NASA has achieved network speeds of 267 Mbps\npast the distance between Earth and the sun with its new Deep Space Optical\nCommunications (DSOC) system, which was launched on October 5, 2023. This DSOC\ntesting was done with NASA's Psyche spacecraft on December 11, 2023, while on\nits way to the asteroid of the same name in order to mine it for metal.\nCurrently, the craft is \"healthy and stable\" on its way to an asteroid belt\nbetween Mars and Jupiter, NASA says.\n\nNASA's Deep Space Optical Communications were first tested with Psyche on\nwhile transmitting 15 seconds of 4K video (below) from Earth to Psyche over a\ndistance of 19 million miles \u2014 which is also 80 times the distance between the\nEarth and the moon, and 1.5 times the distance between Earth and the sun. At\nlast, high-bandwidth Internet can operate on a truly galactic scale.\n\nCompared to existing high-end radio frequency systems used by other\nspacecraft, DSOC is 10 to 100 times faster at its tested speeds of 267 Mbps at\ncloser range and 25 Mbps from deep space. By NASA's numbers, this places the\nold systems at a peak speed of around 25 Mbps, with possibly greater gains\nover larger distances. A properly galactic (well, solar) speed boost, one\ncould say.\n\nMore recently, NASA used the later communications transmitting tech to send\ndemo data over 140 million miles away, 1.5 times the distance between the\nEarth and the sun. A slower \"round trip\" testing conducted on April 8 included\nhigh volumes of engineering data on the test itself sent back to Earth. The\nround trip test also used \"digital pet photographs\", which is almost certainly\nNASA code for \"cat memes\", considering the content of the original video sent\nto Psyche. That was 280 million miles in total, to Psyche and back.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nHowever, a few downsides for DSOC still exist. For example, clear skies are\nrequired to transmit high-bandwidth data, and storms can disrupt the\nconnection entirely. This makes it seem that the current communications\nsystems may need to be kept in place for certain flight or safety-critical\nconcerns with future spacecraft\u2014 though it's noted that an array of multiple\nground stations could be set up to receive signals when one goes offline.\n\nAs noted by Ken Andrews, project flight operations lead at NASA's Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL), \"The fact we're doing this now has surpassed all\nof our expectations.\"\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

They said 10 to 100 times faster, and it *should* be\nthe case that the farther out you go, the greater the advantages of laser\ncommunications over radio. It should not be a linear relationship.\n\nReply\n\n  * usertests\n\n> Xenophage said:\n>\n> Because of the inverse square law, I suspect your math about NASA's\n> estimates of bandwidth is wrong.

Don't lasers behave similarly to other forms of communication in\nthat they become diffuse over a distance?\n\nReply\n\n  * domih\n\n<<...At last, high-bandwidth Internet can operate on a truly galactic\nscale...>>\n\nMmm... with a beefy latency of 4.2465 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 x 1000 =\n133,917,624,000 milliseconds with the nearest star.
