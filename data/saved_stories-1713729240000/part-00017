However, classic works adapt CNT metrics that\n> only permit a topological analysis as they do not account for the effect of\n> the input data. In addition, CNT metrics have been applied to a limited\n> range of architectures, mainly including Fully Connected neural networks. In\n> this work, we extend the existing CNT metrics with measures that sample from\n> the DNNs' training distribution, shifting from a purely topological analysis\n> to one that connects with the interpretability of deep learning. For the\n> novel metrics, in addition to the existing ones, we provide a mathematical\n> formalisation for Fully Connected, AutoEncoder, Convolutional and Recurrent\n> neural networks, of which we vary the activation functions and the number of\n> hidden layers. We show that these metrics differentiate DNNs based on the\n> architecture, the number of hidden layers, and the activation function. Our\n> contribution provides a method rooted in physics for interpreting DNNs that\n> offers insights beyond the traditional input-output relationship and the CNT\n> topological analysis.\n\nComments:| IJCAI'24 (full paper, main track)  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.11172 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.11172v2 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.11172arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Emanuele La Malfa [view email] [v1] Wed, 17 Apr 2024 08:42:42 UTC\n(17,804 KB) [v2] Thu, 18 Apr 2024 11:17:43 UTC (17,804 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Deep Neural Networks via Complex Network\nTheory: a Perspective, by Emanuele La Malfa and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
