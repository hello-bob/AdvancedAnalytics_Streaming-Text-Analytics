Brechner Freedom of Information\nProject at the University of Florida. The study was published in March in the\npeer-reviewed journal Journalism.\n\nCuillier and co-author A. Jay Wagner of Marquette University surveyed 330\npeople across the United States who have requested public records from the\ngovernment through state and federal freedom of information laws.\n\nThey compared two different kinds of requesters: Those seeking information in\nthe public interest, such as journalists, researchers, and nonprofit\norganizations, and those seeking information for commercial purposes, such as\nlawyers and businesses that profit from information. The study found that:\n\n  * Commercial requesters were more likely to receive what they ask for, compared to those seeking records in the public interest, such as journalists, researchers and average Americans.\n  * Commercial requesters were more likely to sue the government for records, while public-interest requesters are left with few avenues to challenge record denials.\n  * Those seeking government records in the public interest are much less likely to feel that freedom of information laws positively impact government and individuals\u2019 everyday lives.\n\n\u201cThese findings indicate significant barriers for average people in acquiring\nthe information they need to improve their communities and hold government\naccountable,\u201d Cuillier said. \u201cInformation access should be available to\neveryone, not just companies and those who have the money to sue. That\u2019s the\nwhole point of public record laws \u2013 to inform Americans so they can better\nself-govern, maintaining a strong democracy and republic.\u201d\n\nCuillier and Wagner provide several recommendations for improving the process,\nincluding proactive release of records for commonly requested records and\nestablishment of alternative dispute resolution systems so citizens don\u2019t have\nto hire a lawyer to exercise their right to know.\n\nFacebookLinkedInThreadsXCopy LinkEmailShare\n\nPosted: April 16, 2024 Category: Brechner Center, College News Tagged as:\nBrechner Freedom of Information Project, David Cuillier, Government Records\nLaws, public records\n\n#### Recent Articles\n\nUFCJC PRSSA Bateman Team Receives First Place in 2024 National Case Study\nCompetition\n\nThe University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications (UFCJC)\nPublic Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) Bateman Case Study\nCompetition team has received first...\n\nRead more\n\nJiawei Liu to Join UFCJC as an Assistant Professor in the Advertising\nDepartment and STEM Translational Communication Center\n\nJiawei Liu will join the University of Florida College of Journalism and\nCommunications in August 2024 an assistant professor in the Advertising\nDepartment and in...\n\nRead more\n\n## Connect with the College of Journalism and Communications\n\n### Keep up with the latest news about faculty, alumni, friends, and current\nstudents.
