More\n> specifically, quaternion embeddings, hypercomplex-valued embeddings with\n> three imaginary components, are utilized to represent entities. Relations\n> are modelled as rotations in the quaternion space. The advantages of the\n> proposed approach are: (1) Latent inter-dependencies (between all\n> components) are aptly captured with Hamilton product, encouraging a more\n> compact interaction between entities and relations; (2) Quaternions enable\n> expressive rotation in four-dimensional space and have more degree of\n> freedom than rotation in complex plane; (3) The proposed framework is a\n> generalization of ComplEx on hypercomplex space while offering better\n> geometrical interpretations, concurrently satisfying the key desiderata of\n> relational representation learning (i.e., modeling symmetry, anti-symmetry\n> and inversion). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves\n> state-of-the-art performance on four well-established knowledge graph\n> completion benchmarks.\n\nComments:| Accepted by NeurIPS 2019  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine\nLearning (stat.ML)  \nCite as:| arXiv:1904.10281 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:1904.10281v3 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1904.10281arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Shuai Zhang [view email] [v1] Tue, 23 Apr 2019 12:36:59 UTC (165 KB)\n[v2] Sat, 25 May 2019 06:11:16 UTC (191 KB) [v3] Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:45:00 UTC\n(190 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Quaternion Knowledge Graph Embeddings, by Shuai\nZhang and Yi Tay and Lina Yao and Qi Liu\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 1904\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CL stat stat.ML\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### DBLP - CS Bibliography\n\nlisting | bibtex\n\nShuai Zhang Yi Tay Lina Yao Qi Liu\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
