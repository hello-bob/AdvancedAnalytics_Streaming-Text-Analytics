His DIY micro-RVs proof what company missed\n\n1.7KLikes\n\n26,773Views\n\nApr 212024\n\nMicro-shelter super-designer Paul Elkins (his bike campers have inspired a\nmovement in Germany: Fahrradwohnwagen) has created a pedal RV that converts\nfrom bike to bedroom to kitchen to bathroom to lounge in a space little larger\nthan his own body, and using the cheapest of materials. Elkins used old\nbicycles and fluted plastic (which he often recycles from campaign signs) to\ncreate a bicycle camper that doesn't tow the camper, but instead brings it\ninside the bicycle for a hyper-efficient ride. The final bike/camper weighs\nless than 100 pounds, including kitchen supplies and a sleeping bag. The home\nconverts using plywood panels that can be reconfigured to expose the\npedals/handlebars or covered up for sleeping, lounging, or cooking. The\nshower/bathroom is created using a shower curtain that snaps to the wing door\nto create a private area for showering (with a solar shower) that can also be\nused as a sheltered guest room.
