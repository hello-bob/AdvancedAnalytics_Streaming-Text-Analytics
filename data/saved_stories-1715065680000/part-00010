Ask me anything!\n\nSearchBot is thinking ...\n\n\u00d7\n\nPowered by Search Engine Land (and love)\n\nGoogle manipulated ad auctions and inflated costs to increase revenue, harming\nadvertisers, the Department of Justice argued last week in the U.S. vs. Google\nantitrust trial.\n\nWhat follows is a summary and some slides from the DOJ\u2019s closing deck,\nspecific to search advertising, that back up the DOJ\u2019s argument.\n\n## Google\u2019s monopoly power\n\nThis was defined by the DOJ as \u201cthe power to control prices or exclude\ncompetition.\u201d Also, monopolists don\u2019t have to consider rivals\u2019 ad prices,\nwhich testimony and internal documents showed Google does not.\n\nTo make the case, the DOJ showed quotes from various Googlers discussing\nraising ad prices to increase the company\u2019s revenue.\n\n  * Dr. Adam Juda said Google tried to come up with \u201cbetter prices or more fair prices, where those new prices are higher than the previous ones.\u201d\n\n  * Dr. Hal Varian indicated that Google had many levers it could use to change the ad auction design to achieve its desired outcome.\n\n  * Juda and Jerry Dischler confirmed this. Dischler was quoted discussing the impact of increasing prices from 5% to 15% in two slides:\n\nOther slides from the deck the DOJ used to make its case:\n\n  * Google Search ad CPCs more than doubled between 2013 and 2020.\n\n## Advertiser harm\n\nGoogle has the power to raise prices when it desires to do so, according to\nthe DOJ. Google called this \u201ctuning\u201d in internal documents. The DOJ called it\n\u201cmanipulating.\u201d\n\nFormat pricing, squashing and RGSP are three things harming advertisers,\naccording to the DOJ:\n\n### Format pricing\n\n  * \u201cAdvertisers never pay more than their maximum bid,\u201d according to Google.\n  * Yes, but: What Google failed to mention is \u201cProject Momiji,\u201d which very quietly launched in 2017.\n  * What is Momiji: It artificially inflated the bid made by the runner-up.\n  * The result: A 15% increase for the \u201cwinning\u201d advertiser. More ad revenue for Google.\n  * Relevant slides: From the DOJ\u2019s deck:\n\n### Squashing\n\n  * How it worked: Google increased an advertiser\u2019s lifetime value based on how far their predicted click-through rate (pCTR) was from the highest pCTR. According to a 2017 document introducing a new product called \u201cKumamon,\u201d Google had been doing this using \u201ca simple algorithm consisting of bid, three quality signals, and some (mostly) hand tuned parameters.\u201d (A screenshot of this document seemed to indicate Kumamon would add more machine learning signals in the auction.)\n  * In other words: Google raised \u201cthe price against the highest bidder.\u201d\n  * Google\u2019s goal: To create a \u201cmore broad price increase.\u201d\n  * The result: The Google ad auction winner paid more than it should have if squashing wasn\u2019t part of the ad auction.\n  * And: The DOJ indicated this all led to a \u201cnegative user experience\u201d as Google ranked ads \u201csub-optimally in exchange for more revenue.\u201d\n  * Relevant slides: From the DOJ\u2019s deck:\n\n### RGSP\n\n  * What is it: The Randomized Generalized Second-Price was introduced in 2019. (Dig deeper. What is RGSP? Google\u2019s Randomized Generalized Second-Price ad auctions explained)\n  * How it worked: Google referred to it as the ability to \u201craise prices (shift the curve upwards or make it steeper at the higher end) in small increments over time (AKA \u2018inflation\u2019).\u201d It did not lead to better quality, according to 2019 Google emails.\n  * How Google talked about it: \u201cA better pricing knob than format pricing.\u201d\n  * The result: It incentivized advertisers to bid higher. Google increased revenue by 10%.\n  * Relevant slides: From the DOJ\u2019s deck:\n\n## Search Query Reports\n\nThe lack of query visibility also harms advertisers, according to the DOJ.\nGoogle makes it nearly impossible for search marketers to \u201cidentify poor-\nmatching queries\u201d using negative keywords.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s presentation.
