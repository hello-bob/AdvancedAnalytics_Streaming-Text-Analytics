At its peak, it served legions of job seekers resulting\nin roughly 6 million yearly job searches, 2 million yearly \u201capply\u201d clicks, and\nabove industry average application submission rates.\n\nMany community members reported a strong preference for using Stack Overflow\nJobs in their job search because of our unique focus on developer needs, and\nwere truly disappointed to see it go.\n\nBut unfortunately, the business model of the feature was not sustainable for\nStack because of the investment it would have taken to make it competitive\nwith other job sites. However, we are aware of how much users liked it, and\nhow many people found a great job through it. In the last few years, we have\nheard repeatedly from community members that they want it back.\n\nWe heard you, and we are delighted to announce that we are introducing a new\nversion of Stack Overflow Jobs, crafted in partnership with Indeed, a leading\nglobal hiring platform. By partnering with Indeed, we believe we have found a\nsolution that allows us to provide a best-in-class job site experience while\ncontinuing to focus on our strength \u2013 the developer community.\n\n## What\u2019s being tested\n\nStack Overflow Jobs will be launching in the coming weeks as an initial test\n(we will update this post once the experiment is live, so stay tuned). At\nfirst, this will be only available in the US. Through the first phase of this\nexperiment we will be looking to get answers to some of these questions:\n\n  * Does the new Stack Overflow Jobs allow us to bring the same degree of value to technical job seekers as the prior version did?\n\n  * Does this business model enable us to expand to more markets so we can serve more job seekers?\n\n  * Can we create the long-term sustainability needed to continue building upon and improving this feature?\n\nWe know job searching can be stressful and time consuming. Half the battle is\nfinding quality jobs that are a good match for your skills and interests,\nbefore even starting the application process. We believe that by combining the\nunique strengths of Stack Overflow, including our dedication to the developer\ncommunity, and Indeed\u2019s volume of quality tech jobs, we can help developers\nand other technical job seekers find their next great opportunity via a\ncurated, tech focused job site.\n\nWe see this as just the beginning, with hopes of proving out this partnership\nmodel to expand in both product features and functionally, as well as more\nmarkets outside the US.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe new Stack Overflow Jobs, powered by Indeed, will be hosted on its own\ndomain, linked from the left navigation on Stack Overflow and technical Stack\nExchange sites (the same group of sites where you see \u2018Companies\u2019 in the left\nnavigation, though to be clear \u2018Companies\u2019 and \u2018Jobs\u2019 remain separate\nfeatures).\n\nThe job site will showcase thousands of technical job listings in the US. Use\nkeyword searches to find jobs that are a great fit for your interests and\nexperience. In order to apply for a job, hit the \u201capply\u201d button and you will\nbe redirected to the posting on Indeed, where you can submit your application.\nNo personal data about users is shared between Stack Overflow and Indeed.\n\nWe are taking measures to ensure that the listings that populate Stack\nOverflow Jobs will be high quality and highly relevant to the Stack Overflow\nand Stack Exchange technical community. However in the event that something\noff-topic slips through the cracks, we want to get it corrected as soon as\npossible. See the help center article here with more information.\n\n## Feedback\n\nWe are considering this an experiment with bringing back a feature that\npreviously brought a lot of value to the site. As we learn, we will evaluate\ngrowth and expansion opportunities. This may include revisiting features from\nthe original version of Stack Overflow Jobs and/or building new ones, to\ncontinue helping technologists on a job search journey.\n\nOur goal is to create a job site experience that developers and other\ntechnical job seekers love. Let us know how we can do that!\n\nWhen thinking about searching for your next technical role, what pieces of\ninformation or features would be most useful for you?\n\nDo you have feedback about your experience with the original Stack Overflow\nJobs? What did you like or dislike?\n\nWhat are the most important things for us to keep in mind as we iterate on\nthis experiment?\n\n  * discussion\n  * featured\n  * jobs\n  * announcements\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this question\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nedited 23 hours ago\n\nThis_is_NOT_a_forum\n\n6,66544 gold badges3535 silver badges5555 bronze badges\n\nasked yesterday\n\nSashaStaffModSasha\n\n2,17377 silver badges1919 bronze badges\n\n12\n\n  * The help center article here link is a 404 for me.\n\n\u2013 dan1st\n\nyesterday\n\n  * 5\n\n@dan1st we are having a small error there, working on resolving it asap.\n\n\u2013 Sasha StaffMod\n\nyesterday\n\n  * 3\n\nWhy is this posted on MSE as opposed to MSO as this is only about \"the\ndeveloper community\"?\n\n\u2013 dan1st\n\nyesterday\n\n  * 20\n\n@dan1st \"and technical stack exchange sites\"\n\n\u2013 starball\n\nyesterday\n\n  * 9\n\nFor once sharing datas between SO and Indeed on a voluntary basis would have\nbeen useful, yet \"No personal data about users is shared between Stack\nOverflow and Indeed.\".

I understand that there are perspectives on this being considered a\nregular business practice. I know there are marketing reasons to reuse online\nservice names, in this case, Stack Overflow Jobs, but you are not bringing\nback something; you are just reusing a service name. Google has done the same,\neven using the same name simultaneously (a recent case is using \"Workspace\" as\na product and feature name).\n\nStack Overflow has been walking away from its roots. While we should accept\nthat they are a business dealing with complex goals in complex times, I think\nthat it's fair to expect them to keep Meta Stack Exchange as a place leaning\ncloser to what is expected about post titles in the Stack Exchange Network:\nThey should be a summary of the post content and free of \"click bait\" like\nwriting style.\n\nI think that partnerships are good; I just hope that this will bring back the\nbest features of the original Stack Overflow Jobs.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited 22 hours ago\n\nanswered yesterday\n\nRub\u00e9nRub\u00e9n\n\n15.6k33 gold badges2525 silver badges6767 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * 7\n\nYou make good points about the original title of this post.

As a\nmoderator on a technical site and another one, it\u2019s something that would have\npotential long term benefits for my site.\n\nIs this going to replace the companies link (which is essentially a vestigial\norgan of 'old' careers) or is it an added on link without any other changes?\n(I missed that this was covered in the question)\n\nI see other folks have covered the USPs of old jobs/careers, specifically the\ndeveloper story, so I won't retread that again. But I suspect that'll have\nmore value for many people.\n\nI used to critique the old SO jobs as something that didn't work because SO\nwas a small fish in the broader job-website market, so I actually think this\nmay be the right way to go if you can combine letting Indeed do the part of\nbuilding a job site (and ideally at minimal developer work on the SO side) and\nadding the things that made SO jobs unique on top of that.\n\nYou would also do well to remember the main value SO has is their reputation,\nand preserving that with the community would be a good idea if people were to\ngo with the SO Indeed instance over the main one.\n\nOn that note, it feels like you're 'lending' the SO name to a simple rebranded\nindeed page. I'm pretty sure that the answer I'd get here is 'we can't talk\nabout the financial details', but we just went through a very painful belt\ntightening process.
