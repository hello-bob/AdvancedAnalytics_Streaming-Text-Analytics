SFDs are most often used in developing countries.\n\n## Development[edit]\n\nIn 2012\u20132013, the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program sponsored a study\non the fecal sludge management of twelve cities with the goal of developing\ntools for better understanding the flow of excreta through the cities. As a\nresult, Isabel Blackett, Peter Hawkins, and Christiaan Heymans authored The\nmissing link in sanitation service delivery: a review of fecal sludge\nmanagement in 12 cities.^[1] Using this as a basis, a group of excreta\nmanagement institutions began collaborating in June 2014 to continue\ndevelopment of SFDs.^[2]\n\nIn November 2014, the SFD Promotion Initiative was started with funding from\nthe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Initially funded as a one year project,\nit was extended in 2015. In September 2019, the focus of the program shifted\nto scaling up the current methods of producing SFDs to allow for citywide\nsanitation in South Asia and Africa. As of 2021 more than 240 shit flow\ndiagram reports have been published. The initiative is managed as part of the\nSustainable Sanitation Alliance and is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates\nFoundation. It is partnered with many nonprofit organizations such as the\nCentre for Science and Environment, EAWAG, and the Global Water Security &\nSanitation Partnership.^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5]\n\n## Use in developing countries[edit]\n\nThe great majority of those living in urban areas, especially the poor, use\nnon-sewer sanitation systems. This poses environmental and health challenges\nfor growing urban areas in developing countries, and many of these countries\nwill need to change their sanitation strategies as their population grows.\nUsing a shit flow diagram allows political leaders and members of the\ncommunity to see at a glance the challenges facing their sanitation systems,\nand where improvements will be most effective. The simplified nature of the\ndiagram allows for easier dialog about local excreta management. Over 140\ncities in the developing world have had SFDs prepared and published, many by\nnonprofit organizations. They are then used to identify where resources should\nbe focused.^[6]^[5]^[1]^[2]\n\n> So we go and we look around the world at what we call a shit-flow diagram to\n> see where in a city is the sewage going? Is it being processed? Is it\n> getting in the river?\n>\n> \u2014 Bill Gates, ^[7]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Blackett, Isabel; Hawkins, Peter; Heymans, Christiaan (April 1, 2014). \"The missing link in sanitation service delivery : a review of fecal sludge management in 12 cities\".
