It differs from traditional platforms like Patreon and Ko-Fi\nin two key aspects:\n\n## No commission\n\nMembership in the Collective is available for all paying customers of\nCommunick. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are hosting your Matrix server or enjoying\naccess to the whole suite of fediverse services on Communick\u2019s flagship\nservers, as long as you have an active contract you are elligible to receive\ncontributions from backers.\n\nGiven that we already make money in the hosting service, we can offer the\ncrowdfunding platform without taking a cut. We will deduct only the payment\nprocessor fees and applicable taxes, and creators can keep all else.\n\n## Sponsors define a fixed contribution to the whole collective\n\nIn the traditional platforms, the creators define tiers of support and the\nbackers have to pick the one that fits within their budget. Doing that for\neach new creator involves a new transaction and therefore a new set of choices\nand \u201cbudgeting\u201d around. We believe that in the end this makes it harder for\nthose that want to simply support as many people as possible and end up\nconcentrating the donations around those who are more popular or those who end\nup offering more perks to the backers.\n\nWe want to create a simpler approach: backers define their \u201cbudget\u201d upfront by\nselecting a fixed pledge to the Collective - which can start at $5 and go up\nto $100 per month - and after that they can get to choose how much will be\nallocated to each of their favorite creators.\n\nWe believe that while this approach will lead to smaller average contributions\nto each individual contributor, it will make things better by having more\npeople willing to contribute.\n\n### Why are we you doing this? How is this related to proving social media\nservers?\n\nCommunick was created and developed as a proposed alternative to fix the\ncurrent business model for the digital economy of the XXI Century. The already\nfamous \u201cIf you are not paying for the product, you are the product\u201d adage\nillustrates the main issue: while ad-funded business might have have given us\n\u201cfree\u201d services which could be made available to anyone in the globe, it\nunfortunately also created an economic environment where consumers can not\n\u201cvote with their wallets\u201d to signal to the market what are the problems really\nworth solving. It also made investors and entrepreneurs measure the success of\ntheir work by metrics that have little to do with \u201cquality\u201d and made it all\nabout \u201cquantity\u201d: instead of asking themselves How many sons and daughters are\ncloser to their parents than they were before? How many journalists have time\nand resources to investigate stories to their communities? How many people are\nbeing inspired by the work of artisans and go on to create their own things?,\nthey are living and dying by presentations that try to answer \u201chow many users\ndo we have? How many ads can we serve? How much time per day do they spend on\nour site?\u201d. These are not metrics that indicate a healthy economy, and the\nfact that this has become a global phenomenon makes the whole endeavour even\nmore catastrophic.\n\nWe strongly believe that the digital economy is healthier and fairer when\neveryone contributes a bit and that we are transparent on the business model.\nThe crowdfunding platform is essentially a way to extend this principle to\ncontent creators as well. In this approach, they pay us for the service we\nprovide, and they get paid by creating and developing the things that their\naudiences desire. Everyone\u2019s incentives are aligned, and everyone is forced to\nbe kept honest.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
