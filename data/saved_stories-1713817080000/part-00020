Having gained a\nphilosophy degree at Harvard University in 1963, he was then doing a BPhil at\nOxford University under the behaviourist philosopher Gilbert Ryle, but spent\nmost of his time in the Radcliffe science library learning about the brain.\n\nMany philosophers were (as they still are) trying to accommodate the mind, and\nits subjectivity, in third-person science. Yet it seems impossible to identify\n\u201cintentionality\u201d (the \u201caboutness\u201d of thoughts) or \u201cqualia\u201d (the \u201cthusnesses\u201d\nof experience) as nothing but brain states or behaviour.\n\nIn dealing with \u201cintentionality\u201d, Dennett, however, had a novel strategy \u2013\n\u201cfirst content, then consciousness\u201d \u2013 that reversed the usual line of enquiry.\nHe proposed \u201cto understand how consciousness is possible by understanding how\nunconscious content is possible first\u201d.\n\nNature, he argued, has its own unwitting reasons \u2013 \u201cfree-floating rationales\u201d\nthat are \u201cindependent of, and more fundamental than, consciousness\u201d. The\nability of organisms to respond appropriately, if unconsciously, to things in\nthe environment is a \u201crudimentary intentionality\u201d. And, over aeons, the\n\u201cblind, foresightless, purposeless process of trial and error\u201d has knitted\n\u201cthe mechanical responses of \u2018stupid\u2019 neurons\u201d (in certain creatures\u2019 brains)\ninto a \u201creflective loop [that] creates the manifest illusion of\nconsciousness,\u201d he thought. \u201cMind is the effect, not the cause.\u201d As spiders\nmindlessly spin webs, homo sapiens has spun \u201ca narrative self\u201d.\n\nWhat Ryle had dismissed as \u201cthe ghost in the machine\u201d could thus be exorcised,\nnot by denying its existence but by seeing it for what it is \u2013 a conjuring\ntrick rather than magic, an illusion fabricated by what (in his 1995 book\nDarwin\u2019s Dangerous Idea) he called evolution\u2019s \u201creverse engineering\u201d.\n\nDennett\u2019s first book, Content and Consciousness was published in 1969. Sixteen\nother books and numerous papers adapted and extended its thesis \u2013 that\nintentionality can be ascribed, along a spectrum with no clear dividing line,\nimpartially to minds, human brains, bees, computers, thermostats: it is a\nfunctional relation between object and environment. As to exactly when, in\nevolutionary or personal history, conscious intentionality arose, \u201cdon\u2019t ask,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nWe can take what he called a \u201cphysical stance\u201d towards something (considering\nits constituents and their causal interlockings) or a \u201cdesign stance\u201d (seeing\nit as fabricated, by evolution or humans, to serve a particular function) or\nan \u201cintentional stance\u201d (explaining its behaviour in terms of goals that it\nwould sensibly pursue if it were rational).\n\n\u201cThe intentional stance is thus a theory-neutral way of capturing the\ncognitive competences of different organisms (or other agents) without\ncommitting the investigator to overspecific hypotheses about the internal\nstructures that underlie the competences.\u201d We treat chess-playing computers,\nsome animals and humans, as if they had beliefs and desires. But, he was\nfuriously asked, don\u2019t we humans actually have them?\n\nYes and no, apparently. There is no one-to-one match between brain states and\nmental states. It is the creature as a whole that has intentionality. The\ndiscrete individually identifiable mental states that we seem to be having are\n(in reality) \u201can edited and metaphorialised version of what\u2019s going on in our\nbrains\u201d \u2013 equivalent to \u201cuser illusions\u201d on a computer screen: like the\nhourglass, folder and dustbin icons, they betoken the complex processes\noccurring behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cNo part of the brain is the thinker that does the thinking, or the feeler\nthat does the feeling,\u201d said Dennett, nor is, or does, the brain as a whole.\nInstead there are \u201cmultiple channels in which specialist circuits try, in\nparallel pandemoniums, to do their various things, creating multiple drafts as\nthey go\u201d \u2013 until, from among \u201cconcurrent contentful events in the brain ... a\nselect subset of such events \u2018wins\u2019 ... The way to explain the miraculous-\nseeming powers of an intelligent intentional system is to decompose it into\nhierarchically structured teams.\u201d These consist of \u201crelatively ignorant,\nnarrow-minded, blind homunculi that produce the intelligent behaviour of the\nwhole\u201d.\n\n\u201cYes we have a soul but it\u2019s made of lots of tiny robots\u201d was the headline of\nan article about him in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, and Dennett\nendorsed it with amusement. He loved making furniture, building fences,\nmending roofs, tinkering with cars and boats; and, among the many things he\nconstructed were sets of nested Russian dolls to illustrate his philosophy.\nThe outside doll was \u201cDescartes\u201d; inside that was \u201cthe Middle Ghost\u201d (a\nreference to Ryle\u2019s) \u2013 but inside that was a \u201cRobot\u201d. \u201cWe are not authorities\nabout our own consciousness,\u201d he said. The robot is masked by the ghost.\n\nDennett pronounced qualia to be illusions. Ever since Descartes, we have\ntended to assume that we have \u201cmental images\u201d, as if, said Dennett, we could\nview little pictures, visible only to ourselves in an inner \u201cCartesian\ntheatre\u201d.\n\nIf so, we should be able to count the number of stripes on the tiger we are\nimagining, and say whether we have been seeing it face-on or sideways. No such\ndefinite information is available. Mental images are indeterminate in a way\nthat pictures cannot be, and closer to generalised linguistic descriptions. So\nlimited and poor is our access to our own conscious experiences, said Dennett,\nthat it \u201cdoes not differ much from the access another person can have to those\nexperiences \u2013 your experiences \u2013 if you decide to go public with your\naccount\u201d. Indeed \u201cour first-person point of view of our own minds is not so\ndifferent from our second-person point of view of others\u2019 minds\u201d. We take an\nintentional stance on ourselves.\n\nDennett\u2019s views remained pretty consistent throughout numerous books and\npapers, but in recent years he became more lenient towards mental imagery. He\nwas impressed by neuroscientific research suggesting that there are specific\nobservable brain activities that potentially may be decoded as imaging\nprocesses.\n\nAnd, having been stern in denying what is disparagingly called \u201cfolk\npsychology\u201d (a term he invented), he began to describe himself as \u201ca mild\nrealist\u201d about mental states, prepared to concede that \u201cthe traditional\npsychological perspective\u201d is not merely something described by third-person\nobservers.\n\nAvoiding accusations that he smuggled in the subjectivity he so adamantly\ndenied, Dennett had recourse to \u201cmemes\u201d, a concept (invented by Dawkins)\nmodelled on that of genes. Memes are units of cultural practice, including\nanything from language to drama to wearing a baseball cap backwards to\nclapping as a form of praise. They are, in Dennett\u2019s words, \u2018\u201cprescriptions\u201d\nfor ways of doing things that can be transmitted to, and from, human brains,\nand that \u201chave their own reproductive fitness, just like viruses\u201d. We are\ninfected by memes, and it is \u201cthe memes invasion ... that has turned our\nbrains into minds\u201d.\n\nDennett also applied a Darwinian approach to free will. \u201cA billion years ago,\nthere was no free will on this planet, but now there is. The physics has not\nchanged; the improvements in \u2018can do\u2019 over the years had to evolve.\u201d We are\nnow able to predict probable futures, and to pursue or avert them. We are not\ndeluded about having that capacity; as we are, he fulminated, about religion.\nBreaking the Spell (2006) was judiciously named. That was what he was urging\nreligious people to do.\n\nBorn in Boston, Dennett spent the first five years of his life in Lebanon. His\nfather, also Daniel, was a counter-intelligence officer posing as a cultural\nattache to the American embassy in Beirut. He died in a plane crash in 1947\n(later, Dennett\u2019s sister, the investigative journalist Charlotte Dennett,\nwould claim Kim Philby\u2019s connivance in it). Dennett\u2019s mother, Ruth Leck, a\nteacher and editor, took the children back to Massachusetts.\n\nReprieved from matching up to his father\u2019s expectations, Dennett said, he\nnonetheless grew up in his father\u2019s shadow. But little could sap his exuberant\nself-confidence. Characteristically, the title of his 1991 book was\nConsciousness Explained.\n\nIn 1959, having just begun a maths degree at Weslyan University, Connecticut,\nDennett read Willard van Orman Quine\u2019s From a Logical Point of View. He was so\nexcited that he decided \u201cto be a philosopher, and go to Harvard and tell this\nman Quine why he is wrong\u201d. The first two he managed, though for a time he\nworried that Quine (later a great friend) was more interested by Dennett\u2019s\nsculpture than his philosophising.\n\nDennett did contemplate being a sculptor, and would, he said, certainly have\nstudied engineering had his family not been so arts-oriented. Co-director of\nthe Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University in Massachusetts, in 1993\nhe joined the Humanoid Robotics Group at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology to construct a robot (Cog) that would be not only intelligent but\nconscious. The project ended in 2003, and Cog was retired to a museum.\n\nDennett was Austin B Fletcher professor of philosophy at Tufts, and visiting\nprofessor at a host of other universities, including Oxford and the London\nSchool of Economics. His memoir, I\u2019ve Been Thinking, was published in 2023.\n\nHe and his wife, Susan (nee Bell), whom he married in 1962, lived in North\nAndover, Massachusetts, and he also hobby farmed in Maine for more than 40\nsummers, blissfully \u201ctillosophising\u201d on a tractor, sailing his boat Xanthippe,\nfixing buildings and digging drains. Dennett loved solving puzzles and\ndisinterring the inner workings of machines \u2013 above all those of \u201cthe\nmiraculous-seeming\u201d mind. \u201cNo miracles allowed,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is survived by Susan, a daughter, Andrea, and son, Peter, and six\ngrandchildren, and his sisters, Cynthia and Charlotte.\n\nDaniel Clement Dennett, philosopher, born 28 March 1942; died 19 April 2024\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Philosophy books\n  * Philosophy (Education)\n  * Philosophy (World news)\n  * obituaries\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
