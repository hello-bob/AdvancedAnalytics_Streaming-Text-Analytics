Mort was left facing a \u2018tide of anxiety and fear\u2019 whenever she\nconsidered who might have created the images and why, as well as a feeling\nthat treasured memories of her past had been polluted. In her disquieting\nexploration of Mort\u2019s experience, the UK filmmaker Rosie Morris draws out how\nsociety is still struggling to understand the nature of deepfake pornography\nand its harms as the problem accelerates and laws struggle to keep up. The\nfilm also reveals how this disturbing innovation perpetuates age-old issues of\nsexism and objectification.\n\nDirector: Rosie Morris\n\nProducers: Rebecca Mark-Lawson, Daria Nitsche, Clair Maleney\n\nWebsite: Guardian Documentaries\n\n29 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\nvideo\n\nWellbeing\n\nBorn in China, Zee seeks a gender-affirming life in the American Midwest\n\n11 minutes\n\nSave\n\nvideo\n\nRituals and celebrations\n\nA beginner\u2019s guide to a joyful Persian tradition of spring renewal and rebirth\n\n3 minutes\n\nSave\n\nvideo\n\nLove and friendship\n\nLove looks a bit different for a chain-smoking couple in a small apartment\n\n11 minutes\n\nSave\n\nvideo\n\nWork\n\nA Swedish expat in the Philippines wonders: what\u2019s up with people sleeping at\nwork?\n\n14 minutes\n\nSave\n\nvideo\n\nBiography and memoir\n\nThe unique life philosophy of Abdi, born in Somalia, living in the Netherlands\n\n29 minutes\n\nSave\n\nvideo\n\nCognition and intelligence\n\nWhat\u2019s this buzz about bees having culture?
