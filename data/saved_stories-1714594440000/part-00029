Many\nthanks to you and to all the people who support our project. I know we say it\nevery month, but it\u2019s important.\n\nFastly powered repositories\n\nEarlier this month we announced a BETA test for our new Fastly repositories.\nThis is a long test. The more people join it, the better.\n\n> BETA Test: Fastly repositories\n\nWe\u2019re working with Fastly on a partnership to power the next generation of\nLinux Mint repositories. Their CDN (Content Delivery Network) and its caching\nmechanism are extremely impressive. Unlike our repository servers which are\nlocated in one place and have a maximum bandwidth capacity, the Fastly network\nreplicates and caches data to make it available anywhere in the World,\nconsistently at fast speed, without downtime or slow-downs.\n\nTo give you an idea, a single Linux Mint server currently serves data from\nChicago at 1Gbps per second. The further away you are from Chicago the slower\nit might be for you. When the load is high (during a release or during a peak\nof important security updates affecting large packages), the server serves\nmore people at the same time and so its 1Gbps bandwidth gets shared/divided\nbetween all the people who try to get data from it. When there are too many\npeople trying to update, we get really slow speeds or even errors.\n\nWhen Linux Mint started in 2006 our bandwidth needs were relatively modest. As\nthe project grew year after year, the servers were upgraded to have more and\nmore resources and allow for higher bandwidth. We also set up multiple servers\nand balanced the load between them. This allowed us to increase our capacity\nand face higher and higher loads. But the problem remains, it just depends on\nthe load.\n\nThe Fastly network allows us to address the issue in a much better way. First,\nFastly has servers in many different places in the World, so it no longer\nmatters if you\u2019re close or far from our servers. The data is cached by the\nFastly network and serves efficiently anywhere. Second, because the data is\ncached, Fastly is able to provide it even when/if our servers become\nunreachable.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping this test will be a success and lead to a great partnership with\nFastly. Don\u2019t hesitate to join the test and give us your feedback.\n\nNew partnership with Datadog\n\nWe are thrilled to announce a new partnership with Datadog.\n\nDatadog specializes in... data. It\u2019s not just monitoring and log analysis,\nthey provide an incredibly customizable set of tools which lets you define\nyour own parsers, metrics, dimensions and basically get the information you\nwant, analyzed and monitored in real time.\n\nThe stats we shared last month, which showed the popularity of each Linux Mint\nedition, were powered by Datadog.\n\nDatadog could make us understand our own services better. What are the most\ndownloaded packages in our repositories? Which versions? How big is i386?\nWhere is most of the bandwidth going? When during the week? etc.\n\nNote: This data comes from the traffic on the download pages of our website.\nWe do not collect any telemetry inside the OS.\n\nJoining the Matrix\n\nFollowing the discontinuation of Hexchat we announced efforts to make IRC\neasier with the development of a new custom chat room application called\nJargonaut.\n\nJargonaut works. It works well and does exactly what we want. Its\nimplementation was relatively easy and I\u2019d say it\u2019s now 75% complete.\n\nWhen we announced it though, we heard some of your feedback about Matrix. We\ntested that as well and started using it.\n\nToday we\u2019re announcing we\u2019ll be moving to Matrix and integrating Element into\nMint 22 instead of Jargonaut.\n\nWhile being as open as IRC, Matrix provides a user experience which is similar\nto Slack or Discord to some extent. It\u2019s modern, it\u2019s persistent, and simply\nby being modern and persistent it\u2019s actually less confusing to newcomers than\nan extremely simple application like Jargonaut which connects you to a room\nwithout even having to log in.\n\nMatrix also feels future-proof. It has everything it needs to be backed by the\nFOSS community at large. Its specifications continue to evolve. Its many\nclients provide a variety of choices today on different platforms and if we\never needed to make a custom client in the future it would be possible as\nwell.\n\nWith a bit of integration, Matrix can be simple too. Mint 22 will feature a\npreinstalled Web App called Matrix.\n\nThat Web App will show you some information to help you get started:\n\nAnd then it will connect you to the Linux Mint space on Matrix using a Web\nclient called Element:\n\nThe Web App will be present in the WebApp Manager. If you want to use a\ndifferent Matrix client, you\u2019ll be able to modify it or delete it.\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t need to wait for Mint 22 to connect to the Linux Mint\nspace on Matrix. You can simply head over to\nhttps://app.element.io/#/room/#linuxmint-space:matrix.org.\n\nXApp should be independent\n\nLinux Mint is the largest consumer of XApp applications, but the reason XApp\nwas created, as a project, was to make these applications work everywhere and\nfor everybody. Whenever a new XApp application was started, the goal was\nspecifically to NOT make it Linux Mint and/or Cinnamon specific.\n\nAt a time where GNOME applications are less and less designed to work anywhere\nelse than in GNOME, a project like XApp is extremely important.\n\nWas it a success outside of Linux Mint though? Yes and no. Many Xapps are\navailable in other distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc..) but\nvery few distributions actually make use of them.\n\nTake Xubuntu for instance. It used to ship with file-roller, gnome-calculator,\nevince. These applications moved to libAdwaita (more on that in the next\nparagraph) and now look completely out of place in Xfce so Xubuntu replaced\nthem with engrampa, mate-calc, atril..\n\nFor GNOME-Scan, it couldn\u2019t find alternatives though.\n\nThis is GNOME-Scan and Atril side by side in Xubuntu 24.04:\n\nThis isn\u2019t ideal for Xubuntu. These applications are installed by default,\nthis is how it looks out of the box.\n\nBefore I go on with this, I want to say this isn\u2019t criticism directed at\nXubuntu. As an official Ubuntu derivative they cannot ship with a previous\nversion of GNOME Scan, and I think it\u2019s partly our fault they got in this\nsituation.\n\nSo on the right you have Atril which looks like all the other apps in Xubuntu\n24.04, and on the left you\u2019ve got an app which has nothing to do here and\nwhich is designed to integrate specifically with GNOME Shell.\n\nTo add to the issue, although MATE apps such as mate-calc work everywhere,\nthey were designed for MATE, so if you open up the application menu you don\u2019t\nsee \u201cCalculator\u201d in your Xubuntu desktop, but \u201cMATE Calculator\u201d.\n\nNow, why is it partly our fault? Because we never knocked on Xfce\u2019s door\nand/or worked with them.\n\nThey have the same problems as us, as MATE, as Budgie, as many other\ndesktops.. we made Xapps because we needed them in Mint, in Cinnamon. We\ndidn\u2019t want to make Cinnamon apps, so we made \u201cLinux\u201d apps which worked\n\u201ceverywhere\u201d, we wrote it somewhere and we left it that.\n\nIt was enough for us, but it wasn\u2019t enough for Xubuntu or other desktops. From\ntheir point of view they saw Linux Mint making something in their own little\ncorner and putting it on github.com/linuxmint, or even worse they saw nothing\nat all.\n\nWhat should have happened ideally would have been more communication and an\nindependent XApp project, not hosted or maintained by Linux Mint, but by\npeople from various desktop and/or distributions.\n\nXApp should be its own organization, with its own github repositories, chat\nroom, website, etc. It should be a space which facilitates collaboration,\ncompatibility and the development of application which works everywhere, not\njust apps which are needed or maintained by us.\n\nIf we want other developers and other projects to work together on compatible\nsoftware and common solutions, we need a space like XApp. But this space needs\nto be independent of any DE and any distribution for everyone to feel equal\nand to feel welcome. Not just on paper, but in general, in discussions,\nempowerment and decision-making.\n\nXapp is on Matrix at https://matrix.to/#/#xapp:matrix.org. Everyone is\nwelcome.\n\nlibAdwaita is for GNOME only\n\nNo matter what happens upstream, we will always do our best to make each Linux\nMint release a better experience than the one you already have. Applications\nwill be native and look native. They will integrate well. If we let you choose\na desktop theme, ALL installed applications will support it.\n\nIf an application doesn\u2019t support Cinnamon we can\u2019t ship with it in our\nCinnamon edition. The same goes for MATE and Xfce.\n\nIt would be completely unacceptable for us to ship with an application which\nused its own window controls and didn\u2019t follow the system theme. Looking at it\nlong-term, we also do not want our apps to be designed by people who have no\nconsideration for what is important to us, and whose decisions are motivated\nby a desktop we don\u2019t even use.\n\nThis is File Roller 3.42. This application has always been labeled as \u201cfor\nGNOME\u201d, but it integrated well in any GTK desktop. With File Roller 44 this is\nno longer the case. It looks just like GNOME Scan in the previous screenshot.\nIt\u2019s not made for MATE, Cinnamon or Xfce and it really shows.\n\nBy moving to GTK4/libAdwaita this app really became a GNOME app, an app which\nlooks specifically designed for GNOME and nothing else.\n\nSo what do we do in Linux Mint 22?\n\nWe could do like Ubuntu 24.04. They provide a finished product with a high\nlevel of integration. The way they do that is by modifying libAdwaita to\nsupport their theme: Yaru. We could do the same with Mint-Y. It would make all\nGNOME applications look nice in Linux Mint, but we\u2019d have to remove theme\nselection, since it would only work with Mint-Y. In the long term it wouldn\u2019t\nsolve the main issue either: These applications are designed for a desktop\nwhich is more and more different to ours by the day. It\u2019s not just a question\nof themes or look. Today these apps are losing menubars, themes, tomorrow they\nmight come with no minimize button or anything GNOME doesn\u2019t use.\n\nWe didn\u2019t want to fork a whole suite of apps right now. Not with the upcoming\nmajor release and not before we try to make XApp more independent and boost\ncollaboration with other projects.\n\nIn Mint 22 GNOME Font Viewer was removed and the following applications were\ndowngraded back to GTK3 versions:\n\n  * Celluloid\n  * GNOME Calculator\n  * Simple Scan\n  * Baobab\n  * System Monitor\n  * GNOME Calendar\n  * File Roller\n  * Zenity\n\nThese applications are very likely to be forked in the near future, except for\nZenity which we\u2019ll probably stop using altogether.\n\nlibAdwaita is for GNOME and GNOME only. We can\u2019t blame GNOME for this, they\u2019ve\nbeen very clear about it from the start. It was made specifically for GNOME to\nhave more freedom and build its own ecosystem without impacting GTK.\n\nWe want to send a strong signal upstream and towards other projects. We cannot\nand will not support applications which do not support our users and\nenvironments.\n\nWe can\u2019t promote applications to our users which don\u2019t support our users. The\nsoftware manager will be vigilant towards that going forward and list\ncompatible software by default.\n\nI want to reach out to upstream developers here. If your application is only\nfor GNOME, then by all means, ignore this and use libAdwaita, it\u2019s made for\nthat.\n\nIf you intend to support all environments then don\u2019t use this library. At the\nvery least please get in touch with us so we\u2019re aware of your intention and\nkeep you listed as a supported app. You can reach us at\nhttps://matrix.to/#/#linuxmint-dev:matrix.org.\n\nAdwaita no longer works outside of GNOME\n\nAdwaita (the theme) will be removed from the list of available themes in\nCinnamon 6.2.\n\nHere is the Adwaita icon theme in Ubuntu 24.04:\n\nAs you can see the theme provides icons for some categories (Internet,\nAccessories..etc) but not others. Many icons are missing, the desktop looks\ncompletely broken and it\u2019s not a bug, it\u2019s a feature. The direction Adwaita is\ntaking is to only support GNOME and nothing else.\n\nIt would be OK if we could remove Adwaita or not ship with it, but we can\u2019t.\nGTK depends on it.\n\nBudgie didn\u2019t wait for it to break and blacklisted Adwaita 2 years ago. We\u2019re\ndoing it now in Cinnamon. MATE and Xfce should probably do it since it looks\njust as bad on any non-GNOME desktop.\n\nFlatpak verification is extremely important\n\nIn Linux Mint, is it safe to open up the Software Manager and install Google\nChrome? Yes? No? Well.. it depends, and it has nothing to do with how much you\ntrust Linux Mint, or Google.\n\nYou need to trust Ryan Gonzalez because it isn\u2019t Mint or Google which updates\nthe Flatpak for Chrome, it\u2019s Ryan.\n\nNow as it happens, Ryan\u2019s a very nice developer. The problem isn\u2019t Ryan. The\nproblem is that amongst the 6 million people who installed his Flatpak, very\nfew people know who Ryan is.\n\nIn Flathub, a verified app is an app that is published by its original\ndeveloper or a third party approved by the developer. Chrome is published by\nRyan and is therefore \u201cunverified\u201d.\n\nRight now, 42% of Flatpaks have been verified by Flathub. The store is\nactively trying to verify apps, especially now after the XZ story and the\nmultiple times malware was injected in the Snap Store.\n\nThis is Chrome in the Linux Mint Software Manager:\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single mention of Ryan here.\n\nThe situation online on the Flathub website is a little bit better:\n\nThe app is shown as \u201cUnverified\u201d but you still have to dig to find who\u2019s\nmaintaining it.\n\nWe\u2019ve been lucky so far. We really need to take action:\n\n  * We\u2019ll update the Software Manager to not show unverified Flatpaks by default. This will be an opt-in.\n  * When shown, unverified apps will have a score of 0. The score can help a user build trust towards the application, but the issue here isn\u2019t the application, it\u2019s the fact that the maintainers aren\u2019t who people think they are.\n  * When shown, unverified apps will be clearly marked as unverified.\n\nWe\u2019re fully aware this goes against convenience and will hurt Linux Mint a\nlittle bit. It might not be a popular decision but we think it\u2019s a very\nimportant one.\n\nBy the time malware hits Flathub, we hope these measures and the measures\ntaken by Flathub will have minimized the number of exposed users and raised\nawareness around the risks which are being taken.\n\nIn the case of XZ, the maintainer would have been \u201cverified\u201d. What worked for\nus was the vigilance of upstream developers and the time it took for new code\nto make its way into Linux Mint. The malware in XZ affected Debian Sid but it\nnever made its way into Debian Stable, or Ubuntu LTS or Linux Mint.\n\nUnlike the Debian base which takes months or even years to stabilize and reach\nyou here, a Flatpak updated by its maintainer can reach millions of users\nalmost instantaneously. We recommend automated updates, also for security\nreasons. When it comes to Flatpak the risk isn\u2019t just taken at installation\ntime, it\u2019s taken with every update, at a time when you might not even think\nabout Flatpaks. This is more risky than Windows users downloading software\nfrom random websites. It\u2019s supported by the update manager.\n\nYou REALLY need to trust where you get your software from and in our own\nSoftware Manager we don\u2019t show you the info you need to make informed\ndecisions.\n\nWe\u2019ll address this ASAP. Thank you for your attention on this important topic.\n\nSponsorships:\n\nLinux Mint is proudly sponsored by:\n\nGold Sponsors:Silver Sponsors:| Bronze Sponsors:  \n---|---  \n  \nDonations in March:\n\nA total of $9,626 were raised thanks to the generous contributions of 302\ndonors:\n\n$1200 (8th donation), Abigail M. $216, Luca P. $200, John R. $162, Karsten K.\n$162, Thomas Metzinger $150 (5th donation), Scott G. $128, Christopher B. $120\n(4th donation), George C. $120, Christopher L. $108 (4th donation), Michael F.\n$108 (3rd donation), Franky W. $108, Endris $108, Jean-pierre V. $108, Michael\nK. $100 (6th donation), Robin S. $100 (5th donation), Brittany Taylor F. $100\n(3rd donation), Charlotte B. $100, Douglas P. $100, John R. $100, Larry M.\n$100, Rich B. $100, Vaughn A. $95, J\u00e9r\u00f4me G. $80, Brendan Gilet Graphic Design\n$59, Julie M. $54 (18th donation), David M. $54 (9th donation), Volker P. $54\n(4th donation), Reg O. $54 (4th donation), Robert H.

Seeing what you have to do is\neven harder. The extra work beyond easy will be something that I will get used\nto doing. The decisions made by you and your team have always been for the\nbest.

Sam says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 5:59 pm\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to understand everything that was explained here, but I have\none piece of feedback about the comparison picture \u201cThis is GNOME-Scan and\nAtril side by side in Xubuntu 24.04:\u201d \u2014 In my book, the GNOME version wins\nhere: clear, immediate information. The other side could be anything, from\nwaiting to work, to not work at all, to...? This is general feedback, to any\ndevs, to keep users and usability in mind, not just \u201cprettiness.\u201d Same goes\nfor scrollbars \u2013 some of us really need them, so don\u2019t keep trying to kill\nthem off. Just saying.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Clem says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 12:05 am\n\nHi Sam,\n\nI agree with you, and I\u2019ll also say this, I think libAdwaita (the hardcoded\ntheme used by GNOME-Scan) is much better looking than Greybird (the theme used\nby the system, and Atril here in the picture).\n\nBut the problem isn\u2019t which theme looks better. Ultimately that\u2019s subjective\nand Xubuntu\u2019s cosmetic decision. The problem is that they look completely\ndifferent. Here on this picture you only see the theme and the window\ncontrols, but there\u2019s also a huge different in layouts, UI, dialogs, button\nplacement etc.\n\n  4. Seba says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 6:07 pm\n\nRegarding Flatpak, I hope you can update it to the latest version that solves\nthe recently found security problem (CVE-2024-32462).

DaveW says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 8:59 pm\n\nSince there are ever more Ubuntu provided apps that can no longer be used by\nLinux Mint without modification or replacement, what are the major reasons to\nremain based on Ubuntu rather than Debian?\n\nIs a migration to GTK4 in the todo list?\n\nReply\n\n    1. Adri\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Galera says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 11:22 pm\n\nClem has already expressed himself numerous times about this. An Ubuntu base\nprovides a better user experience, compatibility, and access to third-party\nprograms.\n\nThe GTK libraries, although essential in the Linux ecosystem, are becoming\nincreasingly problematic due to the \u201cmonopolistic\u201d attitude of their\ndevelopers, the same as Gnome and Red Hat products.\n\nRegards.\n\n    2. Clem says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 12:01 am\n\nHi Dave,\n\nThis has nothing to do with Ubuntu. These applications are also in Debian. The\nreason you don\u2019t see them in LMDE 6 is simply because the Debian Stable base\nis slightly older than the Ubuntu 24.04 base, which just included the GNOME 46\nupdates.\n\nGTK4, no. We fully support GTK4 apps but we\u2019re not migrating to it.\n\nIt took a decade for GTK3 to be stable, we want to enjoy it for a while. Many\nwidgets we\u2019re using in GTK3 no longer exist in GTK4 so the migration isn\u2019t\neasy and could force the loss of features or layout changes in some\napplications. GTK4 probably needs a library to make it complete and easy to\nuse, a libAdwaita for generic apps really. But nobody made one so far,\nassuming they ever will. Long term we don\u2019t know if GTK will continue to\nsupport themes or even Xorg. Some GTK users moved to Qt or other toolkits.\nSome are looking at GTK3 forks. Some are thinking of making a GTK4 lib. And\nsome like us, are just happy to stay on GTK3 until there\u2019s more visibility\ngoing forward.\n\n  8. InfoLibre says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 10:20 pm\n\nWith Flatpak, Snap, AppImage..., Linux distributions are not anymore safe,\nlike Windows. Everybody can distribute malwares into packages, without any\nverification. It\u2019s indeed an important and good decision to begin to verify\npackages and inform users. Matrix is a very good new too. Linux Mint choices\nare very interesting. I\u2019m more and more happy to use Linux Mint and will\ndonate again.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Adri\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Galera says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 11:26 pm\n\nFrom my point of view, the security (and privacy) of Linux lies not primarily\nin its means of software distribution, but in the permissions of the programs.\n\nRegards.\n\n    2. Clem says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 12:11 am\n\nThey can be safe, or at least safer than they are now. Flathub\u2019s verification\nprocess is very welcome and we really need to support it. Showing permissions\ncould also help users make a more informed decision. Although ultimately\nconvenience is key, no matter what information is shown, and these\ntechnologies put you in direct contact with upstream.\n\nIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve been missing really badly on our Debian frozen package bases\nwhere software is safe but not bleeding edge, direct access to the very\nlatest. It\u2019s both risky and more rewarding. Pros vs cons.\n\n  9. Random person says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 10:52 pm\n\n> Right now, only 25% of Flatpaks have been verified by Flathub.\n\nI\u2019m not sure about that figure. Currently, Flathub states: Verified: 1084 /\nTotal apps: 2574. That\u2019s 42% of apps verified.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Clem says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 11:20 pm\n\nThanks, I\u2019ll correct this asap.\n\n  10. David C. says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 12:14 am\n\nEvery time the Mint team is hit with hard problems it always comes out with\nsome of the best and most well-reasoned decision making I\u2019ve seen in over two\ndecades of software development. No ego and with the good of all in mind. I am\nconsistently impressed and appreciative of all the team\u2019s efforts.\n\nReply\n\n  11. roundabout-host says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 6:28 am\n\nThis was a very good read, thank you for maintaining the distro. You do make\nreally good decisions as always!\n\nNo matter what you want, IRC is dying. Not for us, but for most people it is,\nsince the advent of Discord, Slack and other services. It doesn\u2019t have media\nsharing, or history, or user profiles. Matrix is a great choice.\n\nGNOME can now be considered an enemy to all other distros. They were first a\nfriend, making apps and tools for all of us, they made GTK. Then they made\nGNOME 3, but it didn\u2019t really affect GTK. Now they started tailoring the\nlibrary to GNOME, made their apps use it. And they heavily promote them as the\nonly Linux. You can see it on Flathub, they have a GNOME aesthetic precisely\ndue to this.\n\nWhat I think is going to happen is that even GTK could become unusable for\nother distros. GTK3 will be deprecated around 2030. But GTK5, it will\neffectively integrate Adwaita because it won\u2019t even recognise themes. I don\u2019t\nthink you can migrate to GTK4, as it has no menus. So GTK is a dead end unless\nyou fork.\n\nI also see a problem with GNOME encouraging devs to style their apps more due\nto the users not being able to do so. This could lead to a Windows situation\nwhere 75% of apps have their own window bar and fancy styling. I don\u2019t think\nanyone wants this, except the GNOME devs, of which one said they never met\nanyone who thought themes are good because it doesn\u2019t give them enough\ncreative control. But apps are not websites.\n\nI\u2019m trying to make a widget toolkit myself, because I\u2019m so tired of this. It\nwill have themes. I think what GNOME needs to solve the problems of app\ndevelopers is this: * ability to get the properties of something else (i.e\nthis is similar to a button in appearance, make it look the same but\ncircular); * a general theme attribute light/dark so at least text contrast is\nfine. Mine will have both of these.\n\nAlso, can Zenity be downgraded even further? The last GTK3 version has the\naccept button in the headerbar. Same with Screenshot.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve got some criticism. Without a font app, newbies won\u2019t know where\nto install fonts. At least make a simple dialogue to state where the font must\nbe moved.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Clem says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 10:28 am\n\nHi Vlad,\n\nI don\u2019t agree with the vocabulary. \u201cEnemy\u201d is uncalled for. I also don\u2019t think\nthey heavily promote their ecosystem as the only Linux, quite the opposite,\nthey agree with us on libAdwaita being GNOME-only. They made it so GNOME\ndesign could continue to diverge and innovate without impacting GTK. If you\nask me that\u2019s a very good thing.\n\nThe problem we have is that past that they don\u2019t really care. So if GTK4 is\nincomplete and a poor replacement for GTK3 it\u2019s not their problem. And again\nhere, I can\u2019t really blame them. You can\u2019t expect people to work on something\nthey don\u2019t need or committed to. But we do have a real problem because without\nthat, GTK isn\u2019t really an option long term.\n\nI agree with everything else you said and I think you said it really well. I\njust want to say I understand GNOME\u2019s position even though it really doesn\u2019t\nsuit us and it could indeed lead to the death of themes and many desktop\nenvironments.\n\nRegarding Zenity, let us know which versions introduce which regressions and\nwhich application it impacts. It\u2019s a very small component so it could be\nreplaced easily if it only affects a few apps.\n\nThe font viewer had so many problems. It had been downgraded multiple times in\nthe past already. Nothing to do with libAdwaita at the time, it just crashed\non startup or had critical bugs. We also felt it wasn\u2019t really needed for most\npeople so we removed it. If it\u2019s just the installation of a font file you\nneed, a simple Nemo action could solve that.\n\n    2. roundabout says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 10:45 am\n\nSome GitLab discussions, however, show that they are looking to sometime merge\nlibadwaita and GTK, so GTK will only work with it.\n\n  12. spamegg says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 7:43 am\n\nHonestly at this point we need a serious alternative to Flatpak. There are so\nmany complaints about it on the Forums. People struggle with very large update\nsizes, multiple versions of the same runtime dependencies (especially Nvidia\ndrivers), download errors, some broken apps, permission problems, being stuck\nin `/run/user/1000` directories by default, theming issues, and now malware! I\ncannot in good conscience recommend Flatpak to anyone at this point. There are\nway too many downsides, with almost no upside. Maybe Mint should take a look\nat integrating appimages? There is a distro called Nitrux that exclusively\nfocuses on them. Or something similar to what Arch builds have, that can build\n/ install from source. Even better would be some way of getting newer versions\nof DEB packages (I\u2019m perfectly happy to use older LTS versions but others\naren\u2019t) and forgetting about all the stupid app systems entirely... Anyway,\nI\u2019m not trying to be anti-Flatpak, I hope it improves over time. It really\nreally sucks right now.\n\nReply\n\n    1. roundabout says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 9:20 am\n\nAppimages don\u2019t integrate at all, they\u2019re like EXE for Linux.\n\n    2. spamegg says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 10:03 am\n\nThere is appimage-launcher, which provides Menu / desktop integration. For\nintegration into a software manager program, there is Appimagehub. But yes I\nrecognize it would still be a lot of work. I just feel like somebody has to\nmention it as a future possibility on behalf of all the users struggling with\nFlatpak.\n\n    3. Clem says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 10:59 am\n\nDoesn\u2019t AppImageHub face the same security issues as Flathub? They also need\nto verify the identity of the maintainers.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get into sandboxing/permissions because the vast majority of\nusers don\u2019t review them when they install smartphone apps, Firefox extensions\netc.. if a maintainer requires a permission it\u2019s usually given as a habit and\nfor convenience. That said, Flatpak has that built-in for people who care,\nAppImage doesn\u2019t.\n\n    4. roundabout says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 10:46 am\n\nAppImages don\u2019t theme either.\n\n  13. NM64 says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 8:31 am\n\nEver since coming from Windows, I\u2019ve been baffled by GTK3 and GTK4 somehow\nfailing \u201cFitts law\u201d (the aforementioned file roller is a good example\u2014with a\nmaximized window, clicking the very top-right pixel does not click the (X)\nclose button, though Firefox also falls for this issue).\n\nI\u2019m wondering if XApp as a whole can avoid this issue?\n\nI mean, I cannot help but wonder if the entire reason the issue exists is all\ndown to \u201cbeing for GNOME\u201d which obviously uses a completely different window\nand desktop design that doesn\u2019t even take advantage of \u201cFitts law\u201d with\nregards to corners or other edges of the screen.\n\nReply\n\n  14. Greg says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 8:38 am\n\nAn interesting read, thank you. I hope your point of view on GTK4 an Xapps is\nshared by the maintainers of other GTK desktop environments and applications\nand leads to cooperation. More public discussion seems necessary. And, as you\nobserve, satisfaction with what we already have, e.g. GTK3, if it i s mature\nand performant, can\u2019t be neglected, especially when novelty means mutilation\nof features and incohesive theming (even if attractive, libadwaita looks quite\nnice IMHO). It\u201ds sad that good traditional apps get discontinued and their\nmodern replacements choose looks over functionality. More work that results in\n\u2018less\u2019...\n\nReply\n\n  15. angelo says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 11:33 am\n\nHi Clem, I\u2019m a bit confused practically, if these changes aren\u2019t right, will\nwe move to gnome gtk4 or kde in the future?

Clem says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 2:45 pm\n\nHi Angelo,\n\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll move to GTK4 until it\u2019s clear we have a future with GTK.\nThis is what is being discussed for instance right now for GTK5:\n\nConsider removing the gtk-theme-name setting:\nhttps://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/3586 Consider dropping the X11\nbackend: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/5004\n\nWe would not invest in a toolkit which drops support for themes and/or X11,\nnot until themes and X11 are already dead, which is not the case right now.\n\nBy KDE I think you mean Qt? It\u2019s one possibility. Our favorite toolkit isn\u2019t\nQt though, it\u2019s GTK3.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict where we\u2019ll be in 5 to 10 years, but right now we\u2019re very\nhappy with GTK3. Wherever we move next, I would like to think it will be very\nsimilar to it, or very compatible in terms of what it offers.\n\n    2. Clem says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 3:43 pm\n\nHi Angelo,\n\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll move to GTK4 until it\u2019s clear we have a future with GTK.\nThis is what is being discussed for instance right now for GTK5:\n\nConsider removing the gtk-theme-name setting:\nhttps://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/3586 Consider dropping the X11\nbackend: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/5004\n\nWe won\u2019t invest in a toolkit which drops support for themes and/or X11, not\nuntil themes and X11 are already dead, which is not the case right now.

Our favorite toolkit isn\u2019t\nQt though, it\u2019s GTK3.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict where we\u2019ll be in 5 to 10 years, but right now we\u2019re very\nhappy with GTK3. Wherever we move next, I would like to think it will be very\nsimilar to it, or very compatible in terms of what it offers. GTK3 itself will\nlast a very long time. Some people might complement GTK with libs or fork it\nif it becomes useless, or they might join the GTK project and help them\nsupport what GNOME doesn\u2019t want to work on. Who knows?\n\nThe only thing that is for sure is that the things we need, we need. When\nsolutions disappear the needs don\u2019t vanish, we find alternatives. Right now\nmany people need things which are no longer provided or being discussed and\nremoved. It\u2019s hard to predict who will do what, who will follow and what will\nhappen, but it\u2019s definitely the right time to start talking about it and\ngetting people to understand each other a little bit more.\n\nWhen GNOME 2 disappeared we weren\u2019t ready. I don\u2019t know if you remember the\nmess Mint 12 was and MGSE, we certainly do. It was the only time in our\nhistory we recommended people stay on the previous release. Efforts went\ncojointly towards MATE and Cinnamon. We needed a panel, we needed a menu, we\nneeded a tray icon. We had them before, what provided them disappeared, we had\nto step up and really react. We\u2019re not in this position with GTK but we\u2019re\nvigilant. We could end up killing themes, Cinnamon and X11, shipping with\nGNOME, just like we could fork GTK and never look back. These are two\nextremes. What we know for sure is that we\u2019ll always be a finished product for\nour users, something polished and ready to use. That will never change and\nwe\u2019ll always want to have a better release and stable release every 6 months.\nWhere does that lead us long-term? It depends on GNOME, it depends on Xfce,\nforks, other toolkits, ourselves... it\u2019s hard to say. And right now, the best\nguarantee we can give you is that in between now and then, things won\u2019t\nchange, you won\u2019t be looking at a broken transition, we\u2019ll continue to ship\nwith GTK3 in the short-term and with the same desktop experience.\n\nIf you look back at Mint throughout the years, it changes. It changes slowly.\nIt evolves but without brutal or radical changes. That\u2019s something we\nappreciate and which we find important. The best toolkit to give you that\nexperience right now, even for new projects, is GTK3.\n\nA few more things. We\u2019re really good at what we do and so is GTK. But we do\nvery different things. We do not want to maintain a toolkit and certainly not\nto innovate and build the toolkit of the future. We work with stable software\non a stable frozen package base. We need mature, supported technology which\nlasts a while. GNOME is a bleeding edge project which is turned towards the\nfuture and doesn\u2019t care about the past. But what they see as the past, is not\nonly our present, it\u2019s also our near future. That\u2019s another part of the\nproblem. You see us react to all of this here in 2024 because it just\nlitterally landed in Ubuntu a few weeks ago. We\u2019re already OK until 2026\nwithout having to do much at all, but if you look at the links I posted above\nthey\u2019re about GTK5 and yet they were posted 3 years and 1 year ago\nrespectively. That\u2019s an important aspect to understand in our inability to be\nunderstood/considered by GNOME in their decisions and vice versa.\n\nLooking back at GTK3 it was both painful and a great step forward. It was\nunstable for years but it eventually brought us fantastic innovations.\nGtk.Stack among some of our favorites, HiDPI support of course.. even really\ndivisive technology such as CSD and symbolic icons. If you look back at it,\nthere\u2019s no question only GTK could have innovated that well, but the\ntransition and mayhem they created downstream was almost unacceptable.\n\nWe\u2019ve been reacting to regressions and feature loss since GNOME 2 because we\nhad to. Every time we take on more responsibility we get more empowerment and\nit allows us to implement an even better solution, but if we didn\u2019t have to,\nwe wouldn\u2019t have. We\u2019d have spent our resources more on distribution tooling,\nutilities. I\u2019m really hoping we won\u2019t need to migrate away from GTK, or get\ninvolved in maintaining a fork because we need innovators such as the GTK\nfolks, but I really don\u2019t know. As I said, our core business isn\u2019t to work on\ninnovation, it\u2019s to distribute what\u2019s stable, and prepare the near future, so\nit will depend largely on GTK and other people. We\u2019ll use the best tool to do\nthe job, we just don\u2019t know what tool that will be.\n\n  16. bcb says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 2:53 pm\n\nThank you for the update: I\u2019m glad to see you on Matrix!\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nProudly powered by WordPress.
