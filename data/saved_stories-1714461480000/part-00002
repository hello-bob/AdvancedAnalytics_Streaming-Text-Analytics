That makes it almost\nimpossible to do some repairs, or to assert ownership.\n\nYou can't even begin to repair something if you can't open it up and look at\nit. You can't do the repair if you aren't allowed to move the parts around or\nadd your own new parts. When the \"something\" is software, this means you need\nto be able to look inside that software and at its source code, and you need\nto be able -- and allowed -- to change it. If you don't like to do repairs\nyourself, you need to be able to choose any repair person you trust to do\nthem.\n\nIn a WIRED opinion piece, Kyle Wiens, founder of the popular electronic repair\ncompany iFixit, and one of the spear headers of the right to repair movement,\nsaid, \"As long as we\u2019re limited in our ability to modify and repair things,\ncopyright -- for all objects -- will discourage creativity. It will cost us\nmoney. It will cost us jobs. And it\u2019s already costing us our freedom.\"\n\nNathan Proctor, who leads the US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG)\u2019s Right\nto Repair campaign, spoke to Grist saying, \"If you like democracy and freedom,\nthen you should like right to repair. I believe average citizens should have\nthe power to fix things... We should make it easier for them to take matters\ninto their own hands, for the sake of our collective future.\"\n\nFor a more elaborate introduction to the Right to Repair from Nathan, you can\nwatch his presentation at the FSF's LibrePlanet conference in 2019.\n\n## The right to repair and free software\n\nCars are accelerating their transition from purely mechanical technology to\nrelying on software. This means that any meaningful notion of repair has to\ninclude user rights over that software. Without the freedom to run, modify,\ndistribute, and share the software ourselves, we are now putting our lives at\nthe mercy of manufacturers.\n\nOne example is Tesla, who have introduced a subscription controlled by Digital\nRestrictions Management (DRM) for their (not your) car to keep it active and\nupdated while it is with you. They also obstruct access for general repairs,\nand used or recycled structural parts are not allowed. Nonfree software is\nmaking it impossible to see what the software does, or whether it is safe and\nup to date, or to make it safe when you know it is not. The right to repair\nwould give more control to owners and make us less dependent on the\nmanufacturer and their intentions; in this case, Tesla, who won't let anyone\nelse repair the bugs in their code, even the security researchers who can\nsteal the car in seconds.\n\nTesla's developments are an indication of where the future of electronics is\ntaking us, which is a future that is dangerously dependent on proprietary\nsoftware. But they are far from the only example here. Farmers suffer a\nsimilar fate, with manufacturers of tractors insisting farmers do not own\ntheir tractors, but they merely receive a license to operate the vehicle. This\nmakes it nearly impossible to repair certain older models when manufacturers\ndecide to no longer maintain the software, which forces farmers into\npurchasing new equipment. Freedom to share, study, and modify the software\nwould guarantee a more sustainable business model for farmers, as well as\nprotect their freedom.\n\nIt is this example of automated vehicles that served as inspiration for the\nFSF's animated video Fight to Repair.\n\nHowever, any technology we use could potentially be co-opted by the\nproprietary, DRM-controlled subscription model Tesla and the tractor\nmanufacturers are proposing. Imagine your \"smart home\" having a broken lock,\nor worse, being broken into, and not having the control, or the simple right\nto repair the bug. Countless other examples can be found showing us that the\nkey to a free future is the right to repair. We need to fight for a future in\nwhich the software used is free in order to maintain ownership and control not\nonly over our technology, but over our lives.\n\n## Resources\n\nThankfully, there are many organizations, advocates and innovators who are\ndriving the right to repair movement globally.

By erecting barriers \u2013 whether monetary or logistic \u2013 to owners being able to repair or service their property, manufacturers create the conditions by which needed repairs or maintenance will be delayed or put off entirely. This, in turn, creates the environment in which malicious actors thrive. -- SecureRepairs Statement of Principles\n\n  * Just let us fix our stuff. -- Nathan Proctor, US PIRG\n\n## Related work by the FSF\n\n  * The FSF also runs the Defective by Design campaign, which fights to eliminate Digital Restrictions Management.\n  * \"The right to repair\" by Alison Chaiken\n  * \"EPA opposed DMCA exemptions that could have revealed Volkswagen fraud\" by Donald Robertson\n\n##### Document Actions\n\n  * Share on social networks\n  * Syndicate:\n  * News\n  * Events\n  * Blogs\n  * Jobs\n  * GNU\n\n1PC9aZC4hNX2rmmrt7uHTfYAS3hRbph4UN\n\nTake Action\n\n    \n\nWatch and share Fight to Repair about the crucial need for the right to repair\nthe technology we depend on.\n\nFree software campaigns\n\n    \n\n  * High Priority Free Software Projects\n  * Free JavaScript\n  * Protect Yourself from Surveillance\n  * GNU Operating System\n  * Defective by Design\n  * Fight to Repair\n  * Working Together for Free Software\n  * Secure Boot vs. Restricted Boot\n  * Upgrade from Windows\n  * Free BIOS campaign\n  * End Software Patents\n  * Past campaigns\n\n##### Sign up\n\nRecent blogs\n\n    What role community plays in free software and more -- Interview with David Wilson\n    Meet the locals: Come to LibrePlanet and connect with free software supporters in New England\n    Recent blogs - More...\n\nNews\n\n    FSF to be deposed in SFC v Vizio, updates relevant FAQ entry Apr 29, 2024\n    Alyssa Rosenzweig, who spearheaded the reverse-engineering of Apple's GPU, to keynote LibrePlanet Mar 27, 2024\n    More news...\n\nThe FSF is a charity with a worldwide mission to advance software freedom \u2014\nlearn about our history and work.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2004-2024 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
