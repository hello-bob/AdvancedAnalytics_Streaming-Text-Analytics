Stripe\u2019s new features were announced\nyesterday at the company\u2019s Stripe Sessions conference in San Francisco,\nwhereas Hubspot\u2019s announcements can be found here.\n\nBut the story that\u2019s being swapped by Silicon Valley insiders tells a more\nominous story\u2014both companies have been furiously building in an effort to\nreach some semblance of feature parity with a little known and mysterious\nstart-up, Outseta.\n\n\u201cThe boards of both companies are deeply concerned,\u201d says a TechCrunch\nreporter who asked to remain unnamed.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each company\u2019s attempt to fight back and maintain\nrelevance.\n\n## Hubspot\n\nThe major announcement coming out of Hubspot was the public release of the\ncompany\u2019s \u201cCommerce\u201d product\u2014Hubspot\u2019s first foray into the payments space.\n\nOutseta\u2014which launched its platform that fully integrates payments, CRM,\nemail, and help desk tools in 2017\u2014now has a true peer with a similar feature\nset. Both companies cover the core tools required to run many types of small\nbusinesses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of shocked it took Hubspot so long to offer a payments product,\u201d\nsaid Outseta Co-founder Geoff Roberts. \u201cFor a company whose mission is to help\ntheir customers \u2018grow better,\u2019 it\u2019s pretty tough to grow when you can\u2019t\ncollect payments.\u201d\n\nAs for what took Hubspot so long to reach feature parity, Roberts could only\nspeculate.\n\n> \u201cIt became pretty clear to me that (former Hubspot CEO) Brian Halligan sat\n> down to watch a Grateful Dead special on Netflix and became transfixed,\u201d\n> said Roberts.\n\n\u201cHis pint of Cherry Garcia melted on his couch. I heard he didn\u2019t even watch\nthe eclipse!\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Hubspot\u2019s product leader\u2014CTO and Co-founder Dharmesh\nShah\u2014Roberts had a different theory.\n\n\u201cI think Dharmesh became obsessed with reaching feature parity with Wordle,\u201d\nsaid Roberts. \u201cThat was to our advantage\u2014it took (current Hubspot CEO) Yamini\nRangan taking the reins of the company to awaken the beast.\u201d\n\n## Stripe\n\nAs for Stripe\u2019s announcements, the company created buzz yesterday by\nannouncing the launch of their usage based payments API as well as the ability\nto pay for products like Stripe Billing and Stripe Tax on either the current\npay-as-you-go model or a subscription basis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve offered a usage-based payments API since 2017,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cIn fact,\nit\u2019s how we\u2019ve charged our customers since we started.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m a little surprised by the reception to this product,\u201d continues\nRoberts. \u201cConsidering Stripe currently charges for many of their own products\nusing a usage based model, I\u2019m very surprised they didn\u2019t offer this sooner.\nMaybe they just weren\u2019t processing enough payment volume to make it\nworthwhile\u2014or maybe people just really like spaghetti.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Stripe\u2019s offering of Stripe Billing on a subscription basis,\nRoberts\u2019 comments focused on the simplicity of Stripe\u2019s pricing model.\n\n\u201cLook\u2014I applaud Stripe for offering their customers the simplicity of yet\nanother payment model,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a strange move though\u2014my\nread is the Collison brothers simply couldn\u2019t agree, so they decided to offer\nboth models. It\u2019s tough to break a two-way tie.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for us, customers processing payments with Outseta don\u2019t pay any Stripe\nBilling fees\u2014and never have,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cWe built our own invoicing and\nsubscription management features to save our customers on these fees\u2014and\nthat\u2019s a position we\u2019re excited to maintain.\u201d\n\nStripe has yet to release the new subscription based pricing tiers for Stripe\nBilling and Stripe Tax.\n\nRoberts however had nothing but praise for Stripe\u2019s announcement that they\u2019ll\nsoon be offering automated registration and tax filing for US based\nbusinesses.\n\n\u201cThis is the big one,\u201d he said. \u201cKudos to Stripe for delivering\u2014it\u2019s something\nour mutual customers will immediately make use of.\u201d\n\n## What now?\n\nWhile both Hubspot and Stripe have significantly deeper pockets than Outseta,\nRoberts seemed poised and comfortable with his company\u2019s position in the\nmarket.\n\n> \u201cLook, competition is a good thing. Hubspot and Stripe creeping towards\n> feature parity with Outseta is a reflection that we\u2019ve focused on building\n> the right feature set.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I mean look at it this way\u2014Outseta\u2019s annual revenue is many multiples of\nthe number of customers that Hubspot has. To infinity, and beyond!\u201d\n\n#### About Hubspot\n\nFounded in 2006 in Cambridge, MA, Hubspot raised over $100M from investors\nincluding Sequoia Capital and Google Ventures prior to their IPO in 2014.
