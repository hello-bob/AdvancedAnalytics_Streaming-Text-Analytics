During this mission, similar to Apollo 9, a precursor to\nthe Apollo 11 lunar landing, the crew would validate the ability of Orion and\nStarship to dock and test habitability inside Starship. The crew would then\nreturn to Earth. In another option NASA is considering, a crew would launch in\nOrion and fly to a small space station near the Moon, the Lunar Gateway, and\nthen return to Earth.\n\nTo discuss these options, Ars asked for an interview with Catherine Koerner, a\ndeputy associate administrator who oversees Exploration Systems Development\nfor NASA. Instead, the space agency offered a noncommittal statement.\n\n\"NASA continues to work toward the Artemis II crewed test flight in September\nof 2025 and the Artemis III test flight to land astronauts near the lunar\nSouth Pole in September of 2026,\" the statement read. \"The agency evaluates\nelement progress and status on a daily basis and uses that data to make\ndecisions at the right time for each mission as a part of prudent programmatic\nand mission management. Should a particular hardware element not be available\nto support a mission as scheduled or planned, NASA will evaluate the readiness\nof available hardware for options to make those decisions with crew safety as\nthe number one priority.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## An unrealistic timeline\n\nThe space agency's date for Artemis II is optimistic but potentially feasible\nif NASA can resolve the Orion spacecraft's heat shield issues. A lunar landing\nin September 2026, however, seems completely unrealistic. The biggest\nstumbling blocks for Artemis III are the lack of a lander, which SpaceX is\ndeveloping through its Starship program, and spacesuits for forays onto the\nlunar surface by Axiom Space. It is not clear when the lander or the suits,\nwhich NASA only began funding in the last two to three years, will be ready.\n\nThere are also concerns about the complexity of Artemis III. It will require a\nnumber of previously untested steps, including an Orion-Starship rendezvous\nand docking in lunar orbit; humans flying inside of Starship in space;\nStarship going down to the surface and coming back up to dock with Orion; and\nmore. Mission planners would be more comfortable if they could, in NASA\nparlance, \"buy down the risk\" of Artemis III by validating some of these\ndelicate maneuvers before the lunar landing mission.\n\nThis is why NASA has asked SpaceX to look at a mission where Orion would\nrendezvous with the Starship vehicle in orbit around Earth. Such a\nmission\u2014whether called Artemis IIS or Artemis III\u2014would solve a lot of\nproblems for the space agency and appears to be the preferred option at this\ntime. Critically, it would verify the ability of the two spacecraft to dock in\nan environment where, if there were a problem, it would be much easier for the\ncrew to return safely home. It would also validate the ability of astronauts\nto live inside Starship and perform some ascent and descent maneuvers.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n220\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
