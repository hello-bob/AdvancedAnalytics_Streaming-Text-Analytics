For five months, the spacecraft transmitted unusable\ndata equivalent to a dial tone.\n\nIn March, engineers discovered the cause of the communication snafu: a stuck\nbit in one of the chips comprising part of Voyager\u2019s onboard memory. The chip\ncontained lines of code used by the flight data subsystem (FDS), one of three\ncomputers aboard the spacecraft and the one that is responsible for collecting\nand packaging data before sending it back to Earth.\n\nJPL engineers sent a command through the Deep Space Network on 18 April to\nrelocate the affected section of code to another part of the spacecraft\u2019s\nmemory, hoping to fix the glitch in the archaic computer system. Roughly 22.5\nhours later, the radio signal reached Voyager in interstellar space, and by\nthe following day it was clear the command had worked. Voyager began returning\nuseful data again on 20 April.\n\nNASA engineers managed to diagnose and repair Voyager 1 from 24 billion\nkilometers away\u2014all while working within the constraints of the vintage\ntechnology. \u201cWe had some people left that we could rely on [who] could\nremember working on bits of the hardware,\u201d says project scientist Linda\nSpilker. \u201cBut a lot of it was going back through old memos, like an\narcheological dig to try and find information on the best way to proceed.\u201d\n\n## Minuscule Memory\n\nVoyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2\u2014which also remains operational\u2014were launched\nnearly 50 years ago, in 1977, to tour the solar system. Both spacecraft far\nsurpassed their original missions of visiting Jupiter and Saturn, and in 2012,\nentered interstellar space.\n\n\u201cThat mission literally rewrote the textbooks on the solar system,\u201d says Jim\nBell, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University and author of a book\nrecounting 40 years of the mission. \u201cWe\u2019ve never sent anything out that far,\nso every bit of data they send back is new.\u201d The 1960s and 1970s technology,\non the other hand, is now ancient.\n\nDecades after the tech went out of vogue, the FDS still uses assembly language\nand 16-bit words. \u201cThese are two positively geriatric spacecraft,\u201d says Todd\nBarber, a propulsion engineer for Voyager. Working to fix the issues, he says,\nis \u201clike palliative care.\u201d\n\nVoyager\u2019s flight data subsystem (FDS) and other computers were custom built\nfor the mission by General Electric.JPL photo 360-751AC\n\nTo first diagnose the issue, NASA\u2019s engineers first tried turning on and off\ndifferent instruments, says Spilker. When that proved unsuccessful, they\ninitiated a full memory readout of the FDS. \u201cThat\u2019s what led to us finding\nthat piece of hardware that had failed and that 256-bit chunk of memory,\u201d she\nsays. In one chip, the engineers found a stuck bit, fixed at the same binary\nvalue. It became clear that the chip was irreparable, so the team had to\nidentify and relocate the affected code.\n\nHowever, no single location was large enough to accommodate the extra 256\nbits. \u201cThe size of the memory was the biggest challenge in this anomaly,\u201d says\nSpilker. Voyager\u2019s computers each have a mere 69.63 kilobytes of memory.\n\nTo begin fixing the issue, the team searched for corners of Voyager\u2019s memory\nto place segments of code that would allow for the return of engineering data,\nwhich includes information about the status of science instruments and the\nspacecraft itself. One way the engineers freed up extra space was by\nidentifying processes no longer used. For example, Voyager was programmed with\nseveral data modes\u2014the rate at which data is sent back to Earth\u2014because the\nspacecraft could transmit data much faster when it was closer to Earth. At\nJupiter, the spacecraft transmitted data at 115.2 kilobits per second; now,\nthat rate has slowed to 40 bits per second, and faster modes can be\noverwritten. However, the engineers have to be careful to ensure they don\u2019t\ndelete code that is used by multiple data modes.\n\nHaving successfully returned engineering data, the team is working to relocate\nthe rest of the affected code in the coming weeks. \u201cWe\u2019re having to look a\nlittle harder to find the space and make some key decisions about what to\noverwrite,\u201d says Spilker. When their work is completed, the Voyager team hopes\nto return new science data, though unfortunately, all data from the anomaly\nperiod was lost.\n\n## Built to Last\n\nThe cause of the stuck bit is a mystery, but it\u2019s likely the chip either wore\nout with age or was hit by a highly energetic particle from a cosmic ray.\nHaving entered interstellar space, \u201cVoyager is out bathed in the cosmic rays,\u201d\nSpilker says. Luckily, the spacecraft was built to take it, with its\nelectronic components shielded from the large amount of radiation present at\nJupiter. \u201cThat\u2019s serving us quite well now in the interstellar medium.\u201d\n\nThe 8-track tape aboard Voyager stores data about planets and plasma, not pop\nmusic. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nWhen Voyager was built, the 12-year trip to Uranus and Neptune alone was a\n\u201cseemingly impossible goal for a 1977 launch,\u201d says Barber. The longevity of\nVoyager is a testament of its engineering, which accounted for many\ncontingencies and added redundancy. The mission also included several firsts,\nfor example, as the first spacecraft with computers able to hold data\ntemporarily using volatile CMOS memory. (An 8-track digital tape recorder\nonboard stores data when collected at a high rate.)\n\nImportantly, it was also the first mission with a reprogrammable computer. \u201cWe\ntake it for granted now,\u201d Bell says, but before Voyager, it wasn\u2019t possible to\nadjust software in-flight. This capability proved essential when the mission\nwas extended, as well as when issues arise.\n\nGoing forward, the Voyager team expects to encounter additional problems in\nthe aging spacecraft\u2014though they hope to make it to the 50-year anniversary\nbefore the next one. \u201cWith each anomaly, we just learn more about how to work\nwith the spacecraft and are just amazed at the capabilities that the engineers\nbuilt into it using that 1960s and \u201970s technology,\u201d Spilker says. \u201cIt\u2019s just\namazing.\u201d\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * 50 Years Later, This Apollo-Era Antenna Still Talks to Voyager 2 \u203a\n  * Voyager 1 Hasn't Really Left The Solar System, But That's OK \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Mission Status - Voyager \u203a\n  * Voyager 1 \u203a\n\nvoyager 1hackingsatelliteradio\n\nGwendolyn Rak\n\nGwendolyn Rak is a contributor to IEEE Spectrum.\n\nThe Conversation (0)\n\nSort by\n\nTransportationNewsClimate TechClimate ChangeTelecommunications\n\n## To Make Cars Safer, Connect Them to Everything\n\n20 hours ago\n\n3 min read\n\n1\n\nAerospaceNewsComputing\n\n## \u201cVideo Games\u201d for Flies Shed Light on How They Fly\n\n05 May 2024\n\n3 min read\n\n2\n\nThe InstituteCareersNews\n\n## IEEE\u2019s Honor Society Expands to More Countries\n\n03 May 2024\n\n3 min read\n\n## Related Stories\n\nAerospaceNewsEnergyTelecommunications\n\n## Satellite Radar Sharpens Ukraine Dam Collapse Questions\n\nDIYHands OnMagazineApril 2024\n\n## The Most Hackable Handheld Ham Radio Yet\n\nComputingSemiconductorsArtificial IntelligenceNews\n\n## Faster, More Secure Photonic Chip Boosts AI Training\n\n", "frontpage": false}
