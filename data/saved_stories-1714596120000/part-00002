Here we present experimental results\ndemonstrating quantum error correction of GKP states based on reservoir\nengineering of a superconducting device. Error correction is made fully\nautonomous through an unconditional reset of an auxiliary transmon qubit. We\nshow that the lifetime of the logical qubit is increased from quantum error\ncorrection, therefore reaching the point at which more errors are corrected\nthan generated.\n\n  * Received 28 September 2023\n  * Accepted 11 March 2024\n\nDOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.150607\n\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The storage mode, in which the GKP\ncode is encoded, is the fundamental mode of a coaxial cavity dispersively\ncoupled to an auxiliary transmon qubit. The auxiliary is also dispersively\ncoupled to an on-chip resonator used for readout and reset. (b) Protocol for\nthe initialization of GKP logical states with a depth-N circuit. Each layer n\nconsists of an auxiliary rotation of parameter Rn and a conditional\ndisplacement on the storage mode of parameter \u03b2n. (c) Protocol for measurement\nof the characteristic function of initialized GKP logical states. Real part of\nthe characteristic function Re(C|\u00b1 \u0304\u03bc\u27e9), of GKP logical states (d) |\u2212 \u0304X\u27e9, (e)\n|+ \u0304X\u27e9, and (f) |\u2212 \u0304Y\u27e9 for \u0394=0.36 using a circuit with a depth N=9, leading to\nan initialization duration of 7.86 \u03bcs excluding resets. (g) State fidelity\nestimated from state reconstruction given measured (d)\u2013(f) and simulated\ncharacteristic functions.\n\nReuse & Permissions\n\n  * ###### Figure 2\n\n(a) Dissipative swap between the auxiliary qubit and the resonator enabled by\nan effective |f0\u27e9r\u2194|g1\u27e9r transition, followed by relaxation as |g1\u27e9r\u2192|g0\u27e9r.\n(b) Reset protocol with Nds dissipative swaps. (c) Average reset error \u03b5rt as\na function of Nds measured experimentally (orange) and obtained from numerical\nsimulations (teal). The horizontal dashed line indicates the experimental\nnoise floor of 4\u00d710\u22124. (d) Logical fidelity FL measured as a function of free\nevolution time (blue, top axis) or number of dissipative swaps (orange, bottom\naxis). Plain and dashed lines show fits to the data from which logical\nlifetimes TL of 0.176 and 0.143 ms are obtained for free evolution without and\nwith dissipative swaps, respectively. The limit FL\u21920.5 represents a fully\ndecohered logical channel.

After initialization of a\nGKP logical state (encoding), the sBs protocol is either applied (with QEC) or\nnot (without QEC) Nid times. An extra idle time Tid between each round is\nadded in both cases. The GKP qubit Pauli expectation value \u27e8^\u03bc0\u27e9\u00b1 is measured\nfor states |\u00b1 \u0304\u03bc\u27e9 (decoding). (c) Logical fidelity FL measured as a function\nof time without QEC (blue) and with default (red) or optimized sBs protocols\n(turquoise) for Tid=40 \u03bcs. The full lines show the decay of the logical\nfidelity obtained from a fitting procedure [31]. The data without QEC are the\nsame as in Fig. 2. (d) Logical lifetime TL obtained experimentally (dark bars)\nand numerically (pale bars). The horizontal dashed line corresponds to the\nlogical lifetime without QEC.\n\nReuse & Permissions\n\n1 of 3\n\n\u00d7\n\nSign up to receive regular email alerts from Physical Review Letters\n\n##### More Links\n\n  * APS\n  * Current Issue\n  * Earlier Issues\n  * News & Announcements\n  * About this Journal\n  * Editorial Team\n  * About the Journals\n  * Join APS\n\n  * ###### Authors\n\n    * General Information\n    * Submit a Manuscript\n    * Publication Rights\n    * Open Access\n    * SCOAP^3\n    * Policies & Practices\n    * Tips for Authors\n    * Professional Conduct\n\n  * ###### Referees\n\n    * General Information\n    * Submit a Report\n    * Update Your Information\n    * Policies & Practices\n    * Referee FAQ\n    * Guidelines for Referees\n    * Outstanding Referees\n\n  * ###### Librarians\n\n    * General Information\n    * Subscriptions\n    * Online License Agreement\n    * Usage Statistics\n    * Your Account\n\n  * ###### Students\n\n    * Physics\n    * PhysicsCentral\n    * Student Membership\n\n  * ###### APS Members\n\n    * Subscriptions\n    * Article Packs\n    * Membership\n    * FAQ\n    * APS News\n    * Meetings & Events\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Policies\n  * Contact Information\n  * Feedback\n\nISSN 1079-7114 (online), 0031-9007 (print). \u00a92024 American Physical Society.\nAll rights reserved.
