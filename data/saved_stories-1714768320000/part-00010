Therefore, the assumed distribution\n> of longevities has some bearing on the chances of success of technosignature\n> searches, as well as on the inferred age of technosignatures following a\n> first contact. Here, we investigate the possibility that the longevity of\n> technosignatures conforms to the so-called Lindy's law, whereby, at any\n> time, their remaining life expectancy is roughly proportional to their age.\n> We show that, if Lindy's law applies, the general tenet that the first\n> detected technosignature ought to be very long lived may be overruled. We\n> conclude by discussing the number of emitters that had to appear, over the\n> history of the Galaxy, in order for one of them to be detectable today from\n> Earth.\n\nComments:| 9 pages, 4 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for\nAstrophysics (astro-ph.IM)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2405.00020 [physics.pop-ph]  \n(or arXiv:2405.00020v1 [physics.pop-ph] for this version)  \nJournal reference:| The Astronomical Journal, 167, 119 (2024)  \nRelated DOI:| https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ad217dDOI(s) linking to\nrelated resources  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Claudio Grimaldi [view email] [v1] Tue, 20 Feb 2024 22:19:01 UTC (133\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Technosignatures longevity and Lindy's law, by\nA.
