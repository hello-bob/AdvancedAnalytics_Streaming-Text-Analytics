This article documents an early-ninth-century ritual\nfire-burning event at the Maya site of Ucanal in Guatemala and argues that it\nmarked a public dismantling of an old regime. Rather than examine this event\nas part of a Classic period Maya collapse, the authors propose that it was a\nrevolutionary pivot point around which the K'anwitznal polity reinvented\nitself, ushering in wider political transitions in the southern Maya Lowlands.\n\n## Keywords\n\nMesoamericaLate Classic periodTerminal Classic periodroyal burialgreenstone\nornamentspolitical history\n\nType\n\n    Research Article\n\nInformation\n\n    \n\nAntiquity , First View , pp. 1 - 19\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2024.38 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCreative Commons\n\n    \n\nThis is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives licence\n(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/), which permits non-\ncommercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the\noriginal work is unaltered and is properly cited.

The \u2018Big Bang\u2019 that dramatically shifted the\norganisation and composition of Mississippian Cahokia in the Southeast USA\naround AD 1050 is well-documented in the sweeping changes to public plaza\nspaces and shifts in household material culture that followed (Pauketat & Alt\nReference Pauketat and Alt2005; Beck et al. Reference Beck, Bolender, Brown\nand Earle2007). But we can now only speculate about the event or events\u2014such\nas the ceremonial erection of a large cypress marker post in a centre\nplaza\u2014that crystallised this major transformation of Mississippian history in\nthe minds and memories of the Mississippians themselves. The arrival of\nTeotihuacanos to the Maya city of Tikal on 11 Eb 15 Mak (16 January AD 378) is\nrecorded in post-factum textual documents and in the archaeological evidence\nof Teotihuacan presence or influence at the site at around this time (Stuart\nReference Stuart, Carrasco, Jones and Sessions2000; Houston et al. Reference\nHouston, Ram\u00edrez, Garrison, Stuart, Ayala and Rosales2021; Moholy-Nagy\nReference Moholy-Nagy2021), yet the arrival itself, occurring as a distinct\nevent, is unknown in material terms. Such monumental events are historically\ncontingent and emerge from the structural patterns and contexts of socially\nembedded ways of being (Marx Reference Marx1963; Giddens Reference\nGiddens1984). Yet, some moments stand out as particularly \u2018eventful\u2019;\nembodying simultaneously the termination of an era and the emergence of\npossibility (Sahlins Reference Sahlins1985, Reference Sahlins2005; Sewell\nReference Sewell1996).\n\nThis article presents evidence for an early-ninth-century ritual fire-burning\nevent at the Maya site of Ucanal, the capital of the K'anwitznal kingdom\n(Figure 1). Occurring at the dawn of a new political era in the Maya Lowlands\nduring the Terminal Classic period (c. AD 810\u2013950), this event marked a moment\nof change in the kingdom and in the Lowlands more generally, fulfilling\nSewell's (Reference Sewell1996: 844) concept of an \u2018event\u2019 in history as an\noccurrence that not only imparts significant structural change but is\nrecognised as significant by contemporaries. Much epigraphic and\narchaeological research in the Maya area has focused on the collapse of\nClassic Maya polities at the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth\ncentury AD, examining patterns in the last dated monuments or in the ritual\ntermination and abandonment of elite palatial and ceremonial architecture.\nRather than examine this fire-burning event as a bookend to Maya history, we\nview it as a pivot point around which the K'anwitznal polity reinvented itself\nand the city of Ucanal went on to a flourishing of activities.\n\nFigure 1. Regional map of the Maya area with selected sites mentioned in the\ntext (figure by C. Halperin).\n\n## New leadership in the K'anwitznal kingdom\n\nOne of the major transitions in the political history of the K'anwitznal\nkingdom came at the very beginning of the ninth century with the assumption of\nleadership by Papmalil (or Papamalil). The name Papmalil is unprecedented\namong Ch'olti\u2019an texts of the Classic period and may have been foreign in\norigin, deriving from either Chontal Maya (Martin Reference Martin2020: 290,\n295\u20136) or Nahua (Pall\u00e1n Gayol & Mel\u00e9ndez Guadarrama Reference Pall\u00e1n Gayol,\nMel\u00e9ndez Guadarrama and van Broekhoven2010: 18\u201319), with the latter long\nhaving influenced Chontal Maya along the Gulf Coast. Papmalil ruled not with a\nroyal title incorporating the K'anwitznal emblem glyph but as an ochk'in\nkaloomte\u2019, a high title often associated with military leaders and powerful\noverlords of the highest status (Martin Reference Martin2020: 259\u201360, 290;\nGrube Reference Grube, Okoshi, Chase, Nond\u00e9d\u00e9o and Arnauld2021: 41\u20132).\nAlthough we have no written record indicating when he came to power, texts\nfrom other sites mention his (or his namesake's) involvement in alliances,\njoint acts of warfare, gift-giving and supervision of ceremonies for a period\nbetween c. AD 814\u2013859.\n\nPapmalil's rule was not only seminal because of his possible foreign\norigins\u2014perhaps breaking the succession of ruling dynasts at the site\u2014but also\nbecause his rule shifted political dynamics in the southern Maya Lowlands.\nMost notably, Papmalil appears on Altars 12 and 13 at the site of Caracol,\nboth dedicated in AD 820, in the act of gift exchange with the Caracol king,\nToobil Yopaat (Grube Reference Grube, Chase and Chase1994: 95\u20136) (Figure 2).\nThe fact that Altar 23, dedicated only 20 years earlier, depicts a K'anwitznal\nruler, Xub Chahk, captive and in a state of bondage, underscores a rather\nabrupt change in relations (Stuart Reference Stuart2019). Simon Martin\n(Reference Martin2020: 160) argues that the mention of Papmalil on Caracol\nAltar 13 three times as opposed to twice for the Caracol king suggests that\nPapmalil was the dominant player in these exchanges. As detailed on Stela 32\nat Naranjo, also dedicated in AD 820, Papmalil may have also presided over the\naccession rituals of the Naranjo king Waxaklajuun Ubaah K'awiil in AD 814\nbecause the Naranjo king appears on Papmalil's palanquin (Martin Reference\nMartin2020: 295\u20136). Again this marks a change in relations from the Late\nClassic period when Naranjo's ruler, K'ahk\u2019 Tiliiw Chan Chahk, conquered\nUcanal (AD 698), initiating Naranjo's dominance over the K'anwitznal kingdom\nthat lasted until at least 744\u2013748 (Houston Reference Houston and Houston1983;\nCarter Reference Carter2016).\n\nFigure 2.

Grube, used with permission); right) Caracol Altar 13\nshowing Papmalil standing left of Caracol ruler, K'inich Toobil Yopaat, AD 820\n(modified from University of Pennsylvania image Obj. 51-54-9) (figure by\nauthors).\n\nThe K'anwitznal kingdom appears to have also forged key alliances with Nakum\nand Ceibal during the early Terminal Classic period. The K'anwitznal leader,\nChan Ek\u2019 ho\u2019 pet, for example, installed the new Ceibal ruler, Wat'ul K'atel,\nto power on the eve before the turning of the 10th baktun in the Maya long-\ncount calendar in AD 829 (Schele & Mathews Reference Schele and Mathews1998:\n178\u201380). Under Wat'ul K'atel and for at least a century afterward, Ceibal\nexperienced a renaissance of activity with household constructions, the\nerection of new monuments and the building of new types of ceremonial\narchitecture, such as an I-shaped ballcourt and a circular shrine structure\n(Tourtellot Reference Tourtellot1988; Bazy & Inomata Reference Bazy and\nInomata2017). During this time, the name Papmalil is mentioned on Stela 2 at\nNakum in 849, named here as an elk'in kaloomte\u2019 or eastern kaloomte\u2019 (Zralka\net al. Reference Zralka, Helmke, Martin, Koszkul and Vel\u00e1squez2018: 22), and\non Altar 1 at Ixlu in 859, where he was identified as a northern kaloomte\u2019\n(Martin Reference Martin2020: 290).\n\nAt the site of Ucanal, Papmalil appears to have ushered in an era of\nprosperity. Excavations first by the Proyecto Atlas Arqueol\u00f3gico de Guatemala,\ndirected by Juan Pedro Laporte, and more recently by the Proyecto Arqueol\u00f3gico\nUcanal (PAU), directed by Christina Halperin, Jose Luis Garrido (2014\u20132022)\nand Carmen Ramos (2023\u2013present) reveal that substantial construction occurred\nin both the civic-ceremonial core and outer residential zones of the city with\na slight increase in residential population between the Late Classic B'aaluum\nphase (c. AD 700\u2013810) and the Terminal Classic Winik phase (c. 810\u2013950)\n(Laporte & Mej\u00eda Reference Laporte and Mej\u00eda2002; Laporte Reference Laporte,\nDemarest, Rice and Rice2004; Halperin et al. Reference Halperin, LeMoine and\nP\u00e9rez Zambrano2019, Reference Halperin, Flynn-Arajdal, Miller Wolf and\nFreiwald2021; Halperin Reference Halperin2021). Several large phases of civic-\nceremonial construction can also be attributed to the early Winik phase, c.\n810\u2013850/870. For example, Ballcourt 1 was constructed during this time and\nrepresents one of the largest ballcourts in the region at 40m long (Halperin\net al. Reference Halperin, Cruz G\u00f3mez, Radenne, Bigu\u00e9, Halperin and\nGarrido2020a & Reference Halperin, Garrido, Salas and LeMoineb) (Figure 3).\nThe tallest building at the site, Structure A-5, and another large temple-\npyramid building, Structure A-12, were also built during the early Terminal\nClassic period, creating a new centrally located east-west building axis in\nPlaza A, the oldest and most sacred ceremonial zone in the city (Laporte &\nMej\u00eda Reference Laporte and Mej\u00eda2002: 9, 11, fig. 12).\n\nFigure 3. Left) plan of part of the Ucanal site core showing the location of\nStructure K-2; right) illustrated reconstruction of Structure K-2 in its final\nphase (reconstruction by L.F. Luin) (figure by authors).\n\n## The \u2018fire enters\u2019 ritual at Structure K-2\n\nDuring excavations at Ucanal in 2022, a burnt deposit that included human bone\nand other artefacts (Burial 20-1) was found in construction fill at the summit\nof Structure K-2, a temple-pyramid situated in the public Plaza K (Figure 3;\nPerea Reference Perea, Halperin and Garrido2023). The Burial 20-1 deposit was\nsituated on an eroded floor of the penultimate architectural phase of the\ntemple-pyramid (Sub-1) and covered by its final phase of architecture, which\nconsisted of a rectangular temple with a low masonry wall that would have\nserved as the base for a perishable upper wall and roof (Perea Reference\nPerea, Halperin and Garrido2023). The burning does not appear to have been\nconducted in the place of deposition since the limestone blocks and floor did\nnot have evidence of fire damage. The final phase temple constructed over the\ndeposit sat on a raised foundation whose floor (#1) was 1.5m above the\nprevious phase floor (floor #2, which was part of Structure K-2, Sub-1)\n(Figure 4). The construction fill covering the deposit was built up using\nconstruction pens of rough wall alignments of cut stone blocks without mortar.\nThe walls were roughly constructed and only 0.15\u20130.25m thick, too narrow to\nhave served as the walls of a previous temple or building. The ceramics within\nthis fill date to the early Winik phase, which is consistent with an\naccelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon date of cal AD 773\u2013881 (1218\u00b118 BP\nat 92.3% probability using OxCal v4.4, UOC-20030) obtained from charcoal in\nthe burial 20-1 deposit. The preservation of soot and other evidence of\nburning was excellent, indicating that the deposit had not been exposed to the\nelements for any length of time prior to the commencement of construction.\n\nFigure 4. South profile of excavations at the summit of Structure K-2, showing\nthe location of the Burial 20-1 deposit in red (with its largest concentration\nin dark red) in Unit 20B-32 and the large sculpted blocks used as the fill for\nits final-phase construction episode (figure by M. Perea).\n\nOf note is the fact that most of the construction fill is composed of large,\nnicely carved stone blocks that would normally comprise the facing stones of a\nmonumental building rather than its interior fill. The use of enormous\nquantities of recycled facing stones as construction fill was a common early\nTerminal Classic practice at the site. For example, the fill for the\nconstruction of the large 40m-long ballcourt (Ballcourt 1) and for one\nfoundational phase of an elite residential platform (Group J) are also\ncomposed almost entirely of cut facing stones and, occasionally, vault stones\nthat were likely dismantled from an earlier building or buildings (Halperin\nReference Halperin2021). Radiocarbon and ceramic analyses indicate that these\nmassive construction episodes also date to the very beginning of the Terminal\nClassic period.\n\nThe Burial 20-1 deposit consisted of fine black soot mixed with burnt and\nfragmented human bone and body ornaments (Figures 5 & 6). None of the bones\nwere articulated but most of the bone, ornaments and soot were concentrated in\na 0.6m-diameter zone (Figure 5a) in roughly the centre line of the building\nplatform. Although some of the bone fragments and broken ornaments were found\nscattered as much as 1.5m away, covering a zone that extended into units\nUCA20B-31 and UCA20B-32, these bone and ornament fragments were also mixed\nslightly with the stone fill, indicating that the fill stones had been thrown\ninto construction pens with no effort to protect the Burial 20-1 deposit.\n\nFigure 5. Burial 20-1 deposit: a) largest concentration of soot, ash, human\nbone and ornaments, UCA20B-32-3-3520 (photograph by. M. Perea); b & c) burnt,\ncracked and warped long bone fragments, Individual 20-1A (photographs by C.\nHalperin & C. Bello-Hernandez); d) partially burnt femoral head fragment,\nIndividual 20-1B (photograph by C. Bello-Hernandez).\n\n### Burial 20-1 human remains\n\nOsteological analysis indicates that the minimum number of individuals within\nthe deposit is four, all of which were adults (Figure 5c & d; see also online\nsupplementary material (OSM) Table S1). Individual A was an adult whose sex\ncould not be estimated osteologically, though the remains are generally\ngracile. The bone of this individual is burned a white to dark grey with\nfissures and cracks that indicate that significant amounts of collagen were\nstill present in the bone when it was burned. There is evidence of shrinkage\nof the bone, reducing the size by up to 25 per cent, and warping that suggests\nthe fire burned at a temperature of over 800\u00b0C (Ubelaker Reference\nUbelaker2009; Symes et al. Reference Symes, Rainwater, Chapman, Gipson, Piper,\nSchmidt and Symes2015; Cerezo-Rom\u00e1n et al. Reference Cerezo-Rom\u00e1n, Fenn, Cruz\nGuzm\u00e1n, Nava Maldonado, Le\u00f3n Romero and Villalpando2023). The teeth were not\nrecovered but voids in the mandibular alveolar bone indicate that the lower\nright first and second molars were in situ at the time of burning while\nremodelling of the maxillary alveolus suggests that the corresponding upper\nteeth were lost during life. Individual B was a young adult male (21\u201335 years\nold) with large, robust cranial and postcranial bones including a large\nfemoral head fragment that exceeds the male range of a typical skeletal male\n(Buikstra & Mielke Reference Buikstra, Mielke, Gilbert and Mielke1985; Wrobel\net al. Reference Wrobel, Danforth and Armstrong2002) (Figure 5d). The bones of\nthis individual are denser than those belonging to individual A and are\ndiscoloured black, yellow and brown from heat exposure, but lack evidence of\nshrinkage, suggesting that the skeleton was subject to temperatures well under\n700\u00b0C. Individual C was a young adult, probable male, with type-A1 tooth\nmodification (single triangular cut at the tooth base) to the right mandibular\nlateral incisor (Romero Molina Reference Romero Molina1986). None of the bones\nor teeth of this individual show evidence of thermal damage. Individual D was\nan adult (40\u201360 years old) whose bones were robust, representing a probable\nmale. The more advanced age is demonstrated in the degree of osteoarthritis\npresent on the joint surfaces. Similar to individual C, the bones of this\nindividual show no evidence of thermal damage.\n\n### Burial 20-1 ornaments and objects\n\nThe body ornaments included 1470 fragments of greenstone pendants, beads,\nplaques and mosaics (together weighing just over 2kg), 41 obsidian semi-\nspherical objects, large blades and mosaics and 10 004 marine shell beads\n(Figure 6) (8686 complete, 1318 fragmentary), as well as pendants made of\nmammal teeth, a bone perforator, ceramic ornaments, pyrite and slate pieces.\nAs with bone from individuals A and B, most of the ornaments show evidence of\nburning at high temperatures (Tables S2 & S3). Many of the greenstone ornament\nfragments could be pieced together but not all fragments were recovered,\nperhaps due to explosive redistribution during burning. Fire exposure,\nfissures and fracture patterns on the greenstone ornaments are similar to\nthose displayed on burnt jade ornaments recovered from the Sacred Cenote at\nChichen Itza (Proskouriakoff Reference Proskouriakoff1974; Coggins & Shane III\nReference Coggins and Shane1984), although the sheer quantity and variety of\nthe examples from the Sacred Cenote suggest an accumulation from several\nburning rituals over a period of time rather than the single burning event\nthat the Ucanal Burial 20-1 deposit probably represents.\n\nFigure 6. Burnt ornaments from the Burial 20-1 deposit: a) medium spheroid\ngreenstone beads (UC-PV-028); b) Prunum apicinum and other marine shell beads;\nc) marine shell discs; d) marine shell ornaments (Dentalium sp.) (photographs\nby C. Halperin).\n\n### Interpretation of the Burial 20-1 deposit\n\nSeveral pieces of evidence indicate that the human bone and ornaments had once\nbeen part of the contents of a Late Classic royal tomb and we argue that the\ndeposit was part of an early Terminal Classic fire-entering rite (och-i k'ak\u2019\nt-u-muk-il, \u2018the fire entered his/her tomb\u2019) that marked the symbolic and\nliteral destruction of an earlier K'anwitznal dynastic line. Due to the\nchronological overlap of the fire event (AD 773\u2013881) with Papmalil's reign (c.\nAD 814\u2013859), we suspect that he was a key figure in this change in political\nregime.\n\nFirst, radiocarbon dating of Individual A indicates that they died sometime\nduring the Late Classic period (cal AD 660\u2013775, 1294\u00b117 BP at 95.4%\nprobability using OxCal v4.4, UOC-20013), up to a century before the burning\nevent itself. The greenstone pieces also correspond stylistically with the\nLate Classic period. Diagnostic Terminal Classic features, such as horizontal\nnose septum ornaments or more angular and blockier bodily proportions\n(Proskouriakoff Reference Proskouriakoff1974; Halperin & Martin Reference\nHalperin and Martin2020) are absent from the Burial 20-1 greenstone ornaments.\n\nSecond, the quantity and quality of the burnt and broken ornaments indicate\nthat they derived from a royal context. One of the ornament fragments included\na two-sided carved Hu'unal greenstone diadem, the jewel of royalty par\nexcellence (Schele & Miller Reference Schele and Miller1986: 119\u201320) (Figure\n7a & b). Other notable pieces include a round relief pendant of a human head\n(Figure 7c), a plaque with a mat design (another symbol of Maya royalty;\nFigure 7d), an incised decorated disc depicting a wind god figure (Figure 7e)\nand a carved pendant plaque of a human head (Figure 8). The recovery of at\nleast four different sized and decorated ear flares (Table S2) suggests that\nornaments belonged to multiple individuals. The carved pendant plaque may have\nbeen manufactured from an heirloom clam-shaped Olmec-style greenstone pendant,\nand a name likely comprised of three signs sits in the pictured headdress, a\ncommon position for name placement in Maya imagery. The signs include fire\nscrolls, three visible dots\u2014although a fourth missing dot was likely part of\nthe imagery\u2014and two sticks with lines that may represent two torches (Figure\n8). Thus, these symbols may read some combination of K'AHK (\u2018fire\u2019), KAN\n(\u2018four\u2019) and TAAJ (\u2018torch\u2019) to name the figure, whose neck spouts blood or\nprecious liquid scrolls.\n\nFigure 7. Burnt and cracked greenstone ornaments from the Burial 20-1 deposit:\na) Hu'unal greenstone diadem (UC-PV-061; scale bar shared with d); b) drawing\nof Hu'unal greenstone diadem, Topoxt\u00e9 (modified after Taube & Ishihara-Brito\nReference Taube, Ishihara-Brito, Pillsbury, Doutriaux, Ishihara-Brito and\nTokovinine2012: fig. 82d); c) round relief pendant of a human head (UC-\nPV-065); d) plaque with mat design (UC-PV-066) (drawing by D. Hounzell); e) an\nincised decorated disc (UC-PV-045) (photographs by C. Halperin).\n\nFigure 8. Carved pendant plaque of a human head (UC-PV-062), Burial 20-1.\nNote: the original suspension hole ran through the long section of the plaque\nand a second suspension hole was added later, along with the carved head\nimagery, running through the short section of the plaque (photographs by C.\nHalperin).\n\nThird, the remains of a greenstone mosaic funerary mask were recovered from\nthe deposit (UC-PV-052) (Figure 9). Although such masks are occasionally found\nin caches, the majority accompany royal individuals in their tombs (Mel\u00e9ndez\nReference Mel\u00e9ndez2019: tab. 1.2). The mosaic mask was identified by the nose\npiece, a diagnostic element of greenstone mosaic masks (Juna Carlos Mel\u00e9ndez\npers. comm.), and two obsidian eye pupils, which are similar to examples from\ngreenstone masks from royal Burials 8, 37, 39 and 61 from El Peru-Waka\u2019\n(Mel\u00e9ndez Reference Mel\u00e9ndez2019: 825). The edges of the mosaic mask fragments\nwere all uniformly polished and pecked, distinguishing them from clean breaks\nthat occurred during heat exposure.\n\nFigure 9. Fragments from a greenstone mosaic mask UC-PV-052 (main image); two\npolished obsidian eye pupils (top right) with detail of one of them (top\nleft), Burial 20-1 (photographs by C. Halperin).\n\nFourth, microscopic analysis of the ornaments indicates many have a rust-\nreddish coloured pigment on their surfaces or lodged in their incised crevices\n(Figure 10). Red pigments such as cinnabar or hematite were commonly sprinkled\nor painted upon the bodies of deceased royal persons as part of Preclassic and\nClassic period burial rites (Fitzsimmons Reference Fitzsimmons2009: 81\u20133;\nScherer Reference Scherer2015: 76\u20139). A small piece of cinnabar was also\nrecovered from the deposit (Table S3), making it likely that these ornaments\nhad once been part of a royal tomb.\n\nFigure 10. Ornaments from Burial 20-1 with traces of red pigment: a)\nperforated decorated disk (UC-PV-044); b) microphotograph of UC-PV-044's\nincised corner detail showing red pigment; c & e) mammal-tooth pendants; d)\nflat perforated greenstone rectangle (UC-PV-042) (photographs by C. Halperin).\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe argue that the Burial 20-1 deposit was part of a revolutionary historical\nmoment that simultaneously rejected a Late Classic dynastic line and\nestablished an occasion for the founding of a new political order. As Sahlins\n(Reference Sahlins1985, Reference Sahlins2005) and Giddens (Reference\nGiddens1984) underscore, however, events are the reproduction and working out\nof structural traditions that, in turn, create new conditions for action in\nthe world. In putting the Burial 20-1 deposit in a larger structural context,\nit is clear that royal fire-entering tomb rites were not new in the Maya area\n(Fitzsimmons Reference Fitzsimmons2009: 142\u201361; Tiesler Reference Tiesler,\nTiesler and Scherer2018). Classic period glyphic texts describe such rites as\noch-i k'ak\u2019 t-u-muk-il, \u2018the fire entered his/her tomb\u2019 (Stuart Reference\nStuart and Houston1998: 384\u201398), often either marking the veneration of\ndynastic descendants or political acts of termination and rupture (Fitzsimmons\nReference Fitzsimmons, Colas, LeFort and Persson2006). For example, David\nStuart (Reference Stuart and Houston1998: 398\u20139) interprets the glyphic panels\nof Structure A-14 at Ceibal as detailing a fire-entering tomb ritual in AD 747\nby Yich'aak Bahlam, an eighth-century Ceibal ruler. He entered the tomb of\nK'an Mo\u2019 Balam, an Early Classic Ceibal ruler interred more than 300 years\nearlier for a \u2018censing\u2019 event that brought legitimacy to his reign. In turn,\nLate Classic Tomb 1 at Calakmul shows evidence of having been re-entered and\nscorched by fire, which Tiesler interprets as having been a desecratory act\n(Tiesler Reference Tiesler, Tiesler and Scherer2018: 225\u20137). In addition, the\nlikely tomb of Piedras Negras Ruler 4 (Burial 13) was re-entered, the bones\nwere burnt and the tomb contents scattered and destroyed. Piedras Negras Panel\n3 suggests that this act was conducted by Ruler 7, a possible interloper\n(Houston & Scherer Reference Houston, Scherer, Luj\u00e1n and Olivier2010: 183\u20134).\nThe Ucanal Burial 20-1 remains, however, represent tomb contents that were\ntaken and displaced outside of the original tomb, whose location is currently\nunknown.\n\nThe Ucanal Burial 20-1 deposit appears to have been an act of desecration: it\nwas dumped at the edge of a crude wall used as a construction pen and no\neffort was made to protect the fragmented bones and ornaments from the stone\nblocks deposited on top of them as construction fill. This type of deposition\ndiffers from that of an early Terminal Classic cremation burial found\nelsewhere at the site of Ucanal, Burial 21-2, which was located within elite\nresidential Group 103 (Cano Estrada Reference Cano Estrada, Halperin and\nGarrido2020; Halperin et al. Reference Halperin, Garrido, Salas and\nLeMoine2020b: fig. 5a). The cremated bones of an adult female were placed\nwithin and protected by two lip-to-lip bowls with her cremated and fragmented\njade ear flares placed carefully at the centre of the bones. It is possible\nthat a Dolphin Head Red monochrome bowl was placed above the Burial 20-1\ndeposit within the construction fill of the final phase of Structure K-12 and\njust below the sealing of Floor #1 (Figure 4), but the placement of the burnt\nmaterial appears otherwise haphazard.\n\nThe fire-burning event of the Burial 20-1 deposit was likely a dramatic public\naffair that had the potential to instantiate a sense of structural dislocation\n(Sewell Reference Sewell1996: 861). Structural dislocation occurs when there\nis a sentiment of uncertainty that allows the basic foundations of the current\npolitical, social or economic order to be questioned. For example, the French\nRevolution was part of a larger contingent series of events and processes,\nfrom problems of food insecurities and the hallowing out of the state treasury\nto the commoners\u2019 creation of the National Assembly. Yet it was the storming\nof the Bastille, the symbol of French royal and militaristic hegemony, that\nstimulated an intense moment of structural disjunction in the minds of the\nFrench people, allowing them to see their world in a moment of punctuation.\nSimilarly, many other events undoubtedly paved the way for the Ucanal Burial\n20-1 fire-burning event. But because the fire-burning event itself had the\npotential to be highly ceremonial, public and charged with emotion, it could\ndramatically mark the dismantling of an ancient regime. The bones and\nornaments themselves were likely agents in such a turn of history as they may\nhave been imbued with a life force or animating soul that made contending with\nthem a necessary part of change (Novotny Reference Novotny2013; Houston\nReference Houston2014).\n\nIn turn, the structural changes of the Terminal Classic period did not occur\novernight. While Ucanal inhabitants initiated a series of civic-ceremonial\nconstructions during the early Winik phase, many of the new architectural\nintroductions associated with changing political and religious traditions did\nnot occur until the late Winik phase (c. AD 850/870\u2013950). For example, the\nlarge ballcourt, Ballcourt 1, constructed in Plaza A was built in a\ntraditional fashion during the early Winik phase, albeit larger than most Late\nClassic ballcourts. It was not until the late Winik phase, however, that a\nrefurbished stucco floor was added and a low enclosure wall was built at its\nnorthern end to form a T-shaped alleyway (Halperin et al. Reference Halperin,\nCruz G\u00f3mez, Radenne, Bigu\u00e9, Halperin and Garrido2020a & Reference Halperin,\nGarrido, Salas and LeMoineb). Stela 29, the stela monument in front of\nStructure K-2, exhibited a new slimmed-down aesthetic of leadership, one in\nwhich the ruler was no longer depicted dripping with jade ornaments. The stela\nplatform fill, however, dates to the late Winik phase and the stela itself was\nlikely dedicated in AD 879 (Halperin & Martin Reference Halperin and\nMartin2020).\n\nNonetheless, some large structural changes occurred in the Maya Lowlands\nduring the early Terminal Classic period and may be linked to the reign of\nPapmalil. Caracol Altar 12 depicts Papmalil in a seated, side-by-side\n\u2018conference scene\u2019 (Figure 2), one of the first monumental expressions from\nthe Terminal Classic period to exhibit such positionality. Side-by-side\nseating emphasised horizontal relationships on a seemingly equal footing,\nwhich contrasts with the hierarchical positionality of Late Classic imagery in\nwhich rulers were often depicted higher and larger than all figures in the\nscene. Such horizontal political dispositions became popular throughout the\nTerminal Classic period (LeMoine et al. Reference LeMoine, Halperin and\nSalas2022; Carter & Lukach Reference Carter and Lukach2023) and it was during\nthis time that political leaders in the southern Maya Lowlands began to shift\naway from ostentatious displays of wealth and that distinctions between elite\nand non-elite households greatly diminished (Halperin & Garrido Reference\nHalperin and Garrido2019; Chase & Chase Reference Chase, Chase, Okoshi, Chase,\nNond\u00e9d\u00e9o and Arnauld2021; LeMoine & Halperin Reference LeMoine and\nHalperin2021).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Burial 20-1 fire-burning event at the site of Ucanal marked a major\njuncture in the political history of the K'anwitznal polity that rejected an\nearlier dynastic line in the making of a new era of political history. It\ncomprised the re-entry into the tomb (or tombs) of Late Classic Maya royalty\nand the ritual burning of at least two royal bodies and their bodily\nornaments. The ritual burning event, which occurred sometime during the early\nTerminal Classic period, coincides chronologically with the reign of Papmalil\nof K'anwitznal who was responsible for key shifts in political alliances\nthroughout the southern Maya Lowlands. This new era was marked by monumental\nbuilding construction at Ucanal that used facing stones of previous buildings\nas construction fill to bury the symbols of an earlier regime. The fire-\nburning event itself and the reign of Papmalil helped usher in new Terminal\nClassic forms of monumental imagery that emphasised horizontal political ties\nand fundamental changes in the social structure of society. In this sense, it\nwas not just an end of an era, but a pivot point around which the K'anwitznal\npolity, and the Maya of the southern Lowlands in general, transformed\nthemselves anew.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nResearch by the PAU would not be possible without the support and\nparticipation of the community of Pichelito located on and by the site of\nUcanal, of our colleagues from Barrio Nuevo San Jos\u00e9 and project laboratory\nstaff headed by Miriam Salas Pol (https://www.ucanal-archaeology.com).
