In education, for example:\n\n  * It's never been easier to finish homework or write an essay without any engagement whatsoever with the relevant material. (Beware, though! Teachers are apparently adding invisible text with extra instructions, so they can spot students who blindly copied and pasted the text into a chatbot.)\n  * Recommendation letters are easier to produce, so now they're weaker as a signal.\n  * The fact that phones are easy to conceal, and that parents can object when schools want to ban them ($, WSJ), means that even in-class assignments aren't safe. (I can only assume that youthful tradecraft has continued to improve since my middle school days.)\n\nOn the other hand, let's try some other superlatives, starting with the more\nformally academic:\n\n  * It's never been faster to check an essay for grammar problems, whether as a student or a grader.\n  * It's also never been easier to grade unstructured text assignments based on checklists\u2014if the assignment is to explain the causes of the English Civil War or the Great Depression, it's a lot faster to check thirty three-page essays to see if they all reference Divine Right or rising tariffs.\n  * It's never been easier to get last-minute help on tricky concepts, especially if the confusion about them arises at some inconvenient time, like late at night the day before an assignment is due.\n  * Handouts, quizzes, lesson plans, and other textual artifacts of teaching are easier to make. Yes, there is the risk of hallucinations here, but \"read this short text about the topic you teach and correct any misconceptions it contains\" is a core competency that teachers already have.\n\nThese are all ways that AI helps with schooling. But it's also good for\neducation, a thing that can but does not necessarily occur alongside it. What\nis education? A good working definition for being educated is that it's the\nability to meaningfully participate in humanity's pursuit of knowledge.^[1]\nThat's broad enough to cover poetry, econometrics, baking, multivariate\ncalculus, how to comfort a friend after the death of their beloved pet, etc.\nThere's a lot to it; it's never done. Another good working definition is that\neducation is a measure of the recursion depth that you can handle if a curious\nchild keeps asking you \"Why?\"\n\nAnd AI is really, incredibly good for education, especially the kind that\ninvolves exploring topics independently. (It's still a useful tool for\ncheating, but the students who were cheating were also doing their best to\nminimize learning, so all it really does is make that process more efficient.\nYou can put up impressive deadlift numbers by using a pulley instead of\ngetting strong, but if you do that, you weren't really trying to get strong in\nthe first place, were you?) You can trivially write your own lesson plan,\nwhich will not be perfect but will include plenty of information that you\ndon't know you're missing. Similarly, you can dive into advanced textbooks\nwithout fear, because ChatGPT is great at telling you what the prerequisite\nconcepts are for something you're trying to learn.\n\nThis process takes some getting used to, but it's quite doable. ChatGPT\ndoesn't replace teachers, but does offer exactly what a good part-time tutor\ndoes: enough breadth to recognize holes in your knowledge, and to point you\ntowards filling them. It does sometimes hallucinate the textbooks it\nrecommends, but if you search for the topic rather than the exact title and\nadd \"Reddit\" or \"Metafilter\" or \"LessWrong\" to the query, you'll probably find\nwhat you're looking for.\n\nThis kind of education doesn't work for everyone, and it doesn't work for\nevery topic. For example, if you're trying to pick up some kind of tacit\nknowledge, no amount of text is a substitute for an in-person demonstration or\na video. And I\u2019ve also noticed that LLMs tend to have limited knowledge of\nobscure programming languages (though their knowledge of the principles behind\nthem is comprehensive, unless the language in question is truly weird).\n\nThat combination of good theoretical grounding and less practical knowledge\nabout the details of specific libraries is not optimal for productivity\u2014you\njust want to write the code, not to finally learn what's getting hashed in a\nhash table and why it matters! But learning-through-doing is all about\nstructuring work so there's an optimal drag from not knowing quite what you're\ndoing.^[2] This is very hard in a classroom environment; it's very unlikely\nthat twenty five people in the same age range and zip code will all happen to\nbe capable of exactly the same academic work, or will have the same level of\nmotivation in every class. If instruction is mass-produced at the classroom\nlevel\u2014one teacher addressing a class and giving everyone the same\nassignments\u2014the best you can get is a class that's too slow-paced for the best\nstudents and still too fast for the slowest. And even then, although academic\nskills broadly correlate, students do have different relative strengths and\nweaknesses. So even in that optimal scenario, the same student can be bored in\na fourth-grade math class but also struggling in a fourth-grade reading class.\n\nAs with customer service, AI in education could focus less on replacing\nworkers and more on letting them focus on things that are still hard to\nautomate; a teacher who teaches five classes with twenty students each has one\nhundred students to keep track of, and just isn't all that likely to figure\nout that one of them misunderstands a particular fundamental concept while\nanother one is struggling with the mechanics of a problem and should probably\ndo a bunch of practice drills until it starts to click. It's hard to find room\nfor individualized instruction if there's a lot of mass instruction, grading,\netc. in the mix. But if students are interacting with AI tutors most of the\ntime, and talking to a human being when they're truly stuck or can't find the\nmotivation to keep going, teachers will have about as much to do as before,\nbut will be doing more valuable things.\n\nIn that model, students are working at their own pace (at least if that pace\nis fast enough to consistently perform at grade level), and teachers are in a\nsupport role, there isn\u2019t much of a need to lock students into the Nth grade\nthat they're chronologically suited for if they're capable of N+2nd or N+5th-\nlevel work elsewhere. And this can vary significantly by subject; the extremes\nare more visible in math and music than elsewhere, but there's a lot of\nvariance in talent.\n\nAnd that variance presents an important problem: performing well in an\nacademic domain requires some combination of crystalized intelligence (what\nyou know) and fluid intelligence (how fast you think). These can be\nsubstituted a bit\u2014it's a rite of passage for mathy kids to neglect to study\nfor something, forget a critical formula, and then re-derive it during the\ntext, and it's a rite of passage for conscientious and ambitious people to\nhave some class they took which they aced through brute-force memorization\nwhen they couldn't get the concepts down pat.^[3] The more a field advances,\nthe more crystalized knowledge is required to get to the frontiers. Isaac\nNewton was able to make material contributions to math and physics as an\nundergraduate, in part because there was so much low-hanging fruit from the\nabsence of a Newton. A modern Newton wouldn't be making that kind of\ncontribution at that age simply because there's a whole tower of giants-on-\nthe-shoulders-of-giants to scale. Over time, the accumulated-knowledge barrier\ngets higher and higher, and more people aren't scaling the peak until after\ntheir fluid intelligence has started to decline. So any time a sufficiently\ntalented young person is held back in school, we're statistically reducing the\nlikelihood that they'll be at the peak of their thinking abilities by the time\nthey know where to apply them.^[4]\n\nEducation policy tends to focus less on the needs of 99th-percentile students\nthan the rest, in part from the healthy egalitarian view that they will do\njust fine without extra instruction. But that's a narrow and present-focused\nview: raising the ceiling on potential academic achievement today raises the\nfloor on standards of living for the next generation, since so much economic\ngrowth comes from scaling and refining a handful of big inventions, and those\nbig inventions are in short supply. But AI is also great for the 50th-\npercentile student. 99th-percentile kids will tend to appreciate this kind of\ncustomization because they can quickly outstrip anything a standard grade-\nlevel curriculum has to offer in their chosen subject, but the student-level\nimpact is probably bigger for the 50th-percentile student since there's so\nmuch variation in what specific plusses and minuses put them into that status,\nand thus so much room to improve their worst subject. For an educator with\ninfinite patience and infinite attention, the optimal student grade on any\ngiven test is probably something like 70%: better than random but worse than\nadequate is the most informative grade someone can get, since it illustrates\nexactly what they need to move to the next level.^[5]\n\nIt's challenging to actually get a school to adopt something like this.\nThere's the standard reluctance for people who get paid for their labor to\nadopt a labor-saving technology, especially if\u2014as is the typical case\u2014its\noutput is something slightly worse but astonishingly cheaper. But it's\nnecessary: US schools tend to get funded based on the number of students they\nhave, and their costs are fixed; the sixteenth student in a fifteen-student\nclassroom needs a little more effort, but not 1/16th of the total. So if\nthere's a productivity improvement that competing private schools or\nhomeschooling parents discover, they have no choice to adopt it. Education is\nlabor-intensive, and the default for any labor-intensive job in a growing\neconomy is to see continuous declines in productivity; even if teachers' work\ndoesn't change, if the jobs that compete for their talents get more productive\nand pay more, schools have to raise wages to compensate. (It's of course quite\nunfair that every time ASML has a breakthrough, it increase the wages of the\nmedian React programmer. But that's life in a complex economy\u2014you're always\nbenefiting from and suffering from random changes that are outside of your\ncontrol, though the benefit outweighs the suffering on average over time. The\nbest you can do is engineer your job so it's a complement to the things that\nare constantly getting cheaper and better.)\n\nThe approach of AI-enhanced adaptive learning is something I've seen in\naction, and while N is small it seems to work well. I've used ChatGPT to fill\nin lots of gaps in theoretical knowledge, to convert mathematical formulas\ninto programs that I can play around with until I understand them, to confirm\nsome intuitions, disconfirm others, find the right name for a concept so I can\nread the work of someone who understands it better than I do, etc. This is all\nuseful to me, but hard to quantify. It's the ideal middleware between \"I had a\nfascinating conversation with someone who's an expert in a field I know very\nlittle about\" and answering all of the follow-up questions that emerged from\nthat conversation.\n\nMeanwhile, there are already promising signs that an app-first education can\nwork. My oldest daughter attends Alpha School, whose pitch is: two hours of\ntypical schoolwork per day (reading, math, etc.), all in apps, and then\nenrichment activities like learning karate, programming robots, practicing\npublic speaking, etiquette, etc. It's tricky to generalize from a small\nsample, and especially so in education\u2014the parents who select into unusual\nschools will be different from the ones who don't, and randomized controlled\ntrials are expensive and controversial. But: she's in second grade\nchronologically, and when she finished her second-grade coursework, what\nhappened was that her next assignment was third-grade level, and that\ncontinued until she got to fourth. It's possible for a patient parent to lobby\ntheir school to put their child in a more advanced grade, but it\u2019s hard to\narrange, and that grade will still be set by their worst subject rather than\ntheir best. It's a better default, where students are continuously challenged,\nget feedback on their weaknesses, and advance when they're ready, at whatever\npace works. (In fact, one of the questions this model has to deal with is:\nwhen they're chronologically in tenth- or eight- or sixth-grade, and they've\nfinished the K-12 curriculum, how do you keep them busy?)\n\nThis is not cheap, at least for now; if I didn't place a high value on my kids\nnot being bored for a decade and a half, I'd probably spend the money on\nsomething else. But it scales in a way that traditional education doesn't:\nimprovements in the efficiency of app-based education increase the number of\nstudents a given teacher can work with by decreasing the amount of time that\nany given student needs. It also leads to some flexibility for other fixed\ncosts, like real estate. When kids are doing self-paced learning in apps, it's\nsimply not that big a deal if they have to stay home for a day, or go on a\nfamily vacation; I've worked silently at my Laptop Job while my daughter works\nsilently on her Laptop School a few feet away.\n\nSchools move slowly, and it's hard for edtech to make inroads\u2014schooling in the\nUS is an $800bn market of which 120% is already spoken for. But education is\nhard to resist; ultimately, the people who prioritize it are capable of things\nthat other people aren't, and they are the ones who end up in charge. So take\nit as a given that the most ambitious parents will be adopting AI-based\neducation, that their kids will be learning faster and will never get around\nto associating learning with boredom, and that there is no meaningful policy\ndecision that will stop this. The question is: how fast will the rest of the\nschooling system catch up?\n\n  1. You might argue that being educated is the ability to be a good citizen, but that also means that North Koreans, convicted felons in some states, etc. can\u2019t be well-educated. I'd say Xi Jinping was getting an education when he was reading Goethe in exile, even though at the time it didn't look like he'd have much of a shot at political participation. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2. This, in fact, is a good reason to learn a second programming language, a second human language, to read up on moral systems that are very different from the one in which you were raised, etc. When these systems are mature, they have a series of \"what\" answers that help you avoid spending too much time on the \"why\" questions. But a different \"what\" implies a different \"why,\" and reveals inherent tradeoffs in the way things are. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  3. During the days of orgo discourse, it was interesting to talk to some people who thought the class was hard because you had to figure out how to apply the same set of concepts in many surprising contexts, and others thought it was challenging because of all the memorization. For medicine, a field where breadth of knowledge and quick thinking can both be valuable in different contexts, it's good to have a class that can be passed only by being an outlier on at least one of these, but that doesn't require both. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  4. The converse of this is that new fields are often dominated by much younger people, because the barriers to entry are low. If you got into crypto in 2010, you could spend a few months and read just about everything that had ever been written about cryptocurrency. Today, it takes a little longer, and the median participant is correspondingly older. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  5. I haven't talked much about the worst-performing students, in part because I don't have much relevant experience and in part because it seems like a fundamentally different, and much grimmer, problem. Browsing the /r/Teachers subreddit indicates that the problem is not just coursework and feedback. More efficient grading and custom lesson plans for each student are probably not going to do much for the vaping-weed-during-class issue. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n## Diff Jobs\n\nCompanies in the Diff network are actively looking for talent.

But that's not the only way banks fail. The other option\nis the sixteen-year workout of tiny Liberty Bank. Small banks can take their\ntime reorganizing because they're less of a nexus of systemic risk\u2014their\ndepositors will be able to find another bank, and their failure probably won't\nlead to cascading defaults elsewhere. A quick liquidation is expensive,\nbecause whoever buys the bank is underwriting the risk that it's even worse\nthan it looks, and that if it isn't, it will get worse when the best people\nleave. But in a long process, the bank is still making subpar loans and the\ncapital remains tied up for a long time. It also encourages the bank to take\nrisks; if it's failing anyway, a high-risk bet can get it back to breakeven,\nwhile in the event of a failure it would have been insolvent either way.\n\n### AI Asset Plays\n\nThe eventual fate of any company is that its assets are worth more when\napplied to some other purpose, and it shuts down. This usually happens when\nthe economics of the business itself deteriorate, and whatever it bought in\nmore flush times (especially real estate) can be sold. Occasionally, it's the\nopposite: the assets appreciated faster than the business improved, so the\nsensible thing to do is to sell them. And sometimes it's both: a photo sharing\napp, EyeEM, went bankrupt and sold last year; now it's requiring users to\nmanually delete their photos if they don't want them to be licensed for AI\ntraining. This is uncomfortable for people who uploaded photos for some other\npurpose, but in general your attitude towards posting things online should be\nto assume that after a while, they're all either public or deleted ($, Diff).\n\n### Retail Rides Again\n\nRetail day-trading is the rare phenomenon that picked up during Covid, had an\neye-catching peak, and then\u2014reset to a much higher level than pre-pandemic,\nwithout some reversion to the original trend ($, WSJ). Some of this predated\nthe impact of the pandemic (The Diff was writing about WallStreetBets in\nFebruary 2020), but stimulus checks and a lot of time indoors exposed many\nmore people to the joys of volatile stocks and short-dated options. Gambling\nis one of a few industries that try to optimize for customers rounding the\ncost of their service down to zero, at least over the timescales that matter\nwhen they're asking themselves whether it's a bad habit or not. In trading,\nzero-commission is an incredibly powerful way to do that.\n\n### Single-Family Rentals\n\nState and Federal legislators are considering plans to force institutional\nsingle-family landlords\u2014i.e. companies owned by PE or public markets that\nscoop up suburban homes for rental\u2014to divest their portfolios to homeowners\n($, WSJ). This is a business that The Diff has covered a few times ($): to the\nextent that these landlords compete with homebuyers, they're increasing\nprices, but if they compete with smaller landlords, they increase the supply\nof rentable property because their occupancy rate is higher than the\nnationwide vacancy rate. The relevant inventory number is not the easy-to-\ncalculate count of houses sold, but the harder-to-estimate number of available\nhome-months that can be sold to willing buyers. One thing the WSJ piece\nillustrates is that, despite their high growth, these larger landlords are\ntypically 1-2% of all homes purchased by investors, and they've actually\nreduced their share in the last few quarters. The typical home is still owned\nby its occupant, and the typical home that isn't is owned by the kind of\nsmall-scale landlord who has existed for a long time. But even if the larger\nlandlords are a small share of the market, they can still have a price impact\nby driving prices up. On still another hand: they tend to buy in markets where\nthey see favorable demographic trends and tight housing supply, so part of\ntheir social function is to raise home prices today in places where they'd\notherwise rise more gradually over time.\n\n### AI Math\n\nOne of the drivers of the consumer Internet renaissance of the early 2000s was\njust how cheap it was to start a company. Open-source software and affordable\nconsumer hardware meant that the cost of launching was cheap, so the pace of\niteration went up. AI has completely inverted that: there's a high fixed cost\njust to participate, so small companies have had to, and been able to, raise\nsubstantial rounds before they have any real business ($, WSJ). This creates\nsome troubling incentives: hardware and foundation model companies want the\nnext layer of the supply chain to be as fragmented as possible, so they offer\neasier terms to startups. This means that early AI companies, when they do\nhave a business, can easily find themselves addicted to fantasy economics. In\na structurally high-margin business, this is tolerable for a while, but in AI\nit's entirely possible for a company to iterate into a situation where it\nproduces 50% gross margins, but only because more than half of its costs are\nsubsidized by suppliers.\n\n### Share this edition!\n\n#### Sign up\n\n### Become a member\n\nSign Up Now\n\nJoin 50,000+ industry professionals and curious generalists by subscribing to\nThe Diff.\n\n  * Data & Privacy\n  * People\n  * Manifesto\n  * Log In\n\n\u00a9 Copyright The Diff, Byrne Hobart\n\n", "frontpage": false}
