This is also the same for our sister\ncompanies\u2019 Ameritron, Hygain, Cushcraft, Mirage and Vectronics.\n\nTimes have changed since I started this business 52 years ago. Our product\nline grew and grew and prospered. Covid changed everything in businesses\nincluding ours. It was the hardest hit that we have ever had and we never\nfully recovered.\n\nI turned 80 this year. I had never really considered retirement but life is so\nshort and my time with my family is so precious.\n\nI want to thank all of our employees who have helped build this company with\nme over the years. We have many employees who have made MFJ their career for\n10, 20, 30, 40 and more years.\n\nWe are going to continue to sell MFJ products past May 17, 2024. We have a lot\nof stock on hand. We will continue to offer repair service work for out-of-\nwarranty and in-warranty units for the foreseeable future.\n\nFinally, a special thanks to all of our customers and our dealers who have\nmade MFJ a worldwide name and a profitable business for so many years. You all\nare so much appreciated.\n\nSincerely Yours, 73s\n\nMartin F. Jue, K5FLU\n\n### Related\n\nSpread the radio love\n\nThis entry was posted in News and tagged Martin Jue, MFJ, MFJ Enterprises on\nApril 25, 2024 by Thomas.\n\n## 22 thoughts on \u201cMFJ ceases on-site production in Starkville, Mississippi\u201d\n\n  1. Paul April 27, 2024 at 2:03 pm\n\nMaybe MFJ will be purchased by some of the employees and do business under a\ndifferent name ? All Electronics was purchased by some of the employees and\nbecame aretronics . To cut labor costs more DIY kits will become available\nwhich helps interested young folk develop additional skill sets. Happy and\nhealthy retirement to Martin.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  2. Jim WB4ILP April 26, 2024 at 9:17 pm\n\nMartin is a very nice gentleman and I was lucky to meet him on several\noccasions. He has done much for our hobby as well as providing employment for\nmany people. Unfortunately it has become difficult to maintain competitive\nmanufacturing in the U.S. As hard as it already was covid made things much\nworse. It became extremely difficult to get and keep workers. Companies were\ndirectly impacted by their lack of workers and indirectly by their vendors\nhaving the same labor issues. It became harder and harder to meet production\nschedules to fill orders. The cost and leadtimes for everything increased\ndramatically. Components, materials, outside processes, freight, overhead and,\nof course, labor costs soared. Combine that with a long list of products that\nsell in low to moderate volumes and you have a manufacturing nightmare. Martin\nand MFJ have been at the heart of Amateur Radio and now I wish Martin a Long\nand Happy Retirement spent with his friends and family. 73 Martin ! Jim WB4ILP\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  3. Ron April 26, 2024 at 8:53 pm\n\nI still have excellent success with their 1026 noise canceling signal enhancer\nand their 959C antenna tuner preamp. My 784B tunable dsp noise filer had a bad\nsolder joint I diagnosed but then worked a treat also. I was shocked to see\nthe cost of the 1026 now north of $400, such is the cost of small run domestic\nassembly I guess. The good thing is they published the circuits in the manuals\nso many of us can service them if necessary.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  4. John April 26, 2024 at 6:38 pm\n\nWhile it must have been a production nightmare to schedule jobs to make the\nmany hundreds of line items that MFJ produced, I\u2019m grateful for their\nproducts. I still use their wonderful antenna analyzer and have one of the\nvery old \u201cgrey box\u201d CW audio filters that still works .\n\nI sold off my \u201cMFJ Stack\u201d of small QRP rigs that was always in the inside\ncover of QST (Keyer, power supply, VFO , transmitter, audio filter, etc....)\n\nBest to you Mr MFJ!\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  5. Uli April 26, 2024 at 6:15 pm\n\nThanks Martin & team,\n\nfor all of your products and hard work in engineering and support. I\u2019ve loved\nthem all. Especially MFJ. Really sad situation for the ham future. Hope there\nwill be a human team in the spirit to suceed the area of all products for the\nfuture. A ham radio future without the products ? I could not believe that\nthis is possible. No one at earth to be the right person suceeding the\nbusiness?\n\n73 de Uli DL4GG\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  6. Laurin Cavender April 26, 2024 at 5:27 pm\n\nI\u2019ve been acquainted with Martin for many years. I and almost my whole family\nhave been customers of his. I always enjoyed the talks he gave in Atlanta,\nsome of which are on you-tube. I owned, fixed, traded and sold most of the\nitems MFJ ever produced or sold. Almost all their equipment is easy to\nunderstand, use and fix if needed. I\u2019ve also modified many of their items\nalso. Laurin Cavender WB4IVG Tallapoosa Ga.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  7. Ken N. April 26, 2024 at 2:22 pm\n\nThe saddest part to me is Hygain, Cushcraft, and Ameritron leaving the\nindustry. They are the real Icons in Ham Radio. Thanks to all of the MFJ\nemployees I have dealt with since 1981.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  8. Frank April 26, 2024 at 6:44 am\n\nVery sad news. MFJ was our nice sponsor for the SWL Contest 2023 with two very\nnice gifts. I hope someone will buy the rights ( if this is possible ) to\ncontinue to build all this \u00e9quipment for SWL, Ham radio operators, CB radio\nop\u00e9rators, etc. I organise again a contest but no sponsors for 2024. Thank you\nand 73 de Frank SWL F14368 near Paris France\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  9. John ve3ips April 26, 2024 at 6:21 am\n\nI still have various beige box items from his early days and various manual\nantenna tuners.\n\nI would expect DX Engineering to pick up the Hygain and Cushcraft antenna\nlines\n\nPrices have gone up, parts harder to obtain, sales down and stuff made in\nChina having logistic issues\n\nSadly, retailers and customers will be stuck as hams shy away from buying\nanything from them now except at rock bottom prices\n\nHam Radio was MFJ and Martin did a lot for the hobby and he can now retire and\nenjoy life and not worry about having a catalogue of 1000 products\n\nDrake, Ten-Tec, Heathkit and now MFJ\n\nA lot of mom and pop retailers also were shuttered over the years\n\nI used to enjoy shopping at the ham store in Minneapolis and the one in\nSunnyvale\n\nRemember Universal Radio?\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  10. Rob de Santos April 26, 2024 at 6:00 am\n\nIt seems inevitable that a generation of these companies has come to the end.\nUnfortunately, the industry is no longer expanding, and perhaps a sale was not\nan option. No buyers might be out there and willing to take on such a wide\nrange of products and the support that would go with it. MFJ absorbed so many\nother brands in the past decades and who would want so many low volume\nproducts?\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  11. Jock Elliott April 26, 2024 at 6:00 am\n\nWell nuts.\n\nI have found several piece of MFJ gear to be excellent performers,\nparticularly the 1886 loop antenna.\n\nCheers, Jock\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  12. Art Jackson April 25, 2024 at 11:16 pm\n\nReferred to as \u201cMighty Fine Junk\u201d, I don\u2019t know of any Hams that hasn\u2019t bought\nsomething from them, in addition to the other companies they have purchased. I\nam saddened, but I think I have everything that I need from them now that I am\nlong retired. I am kind of shocked no one purchased them. That\u2019s business. I\nstill have MFJ Tuners, a CW Keyboard, a CW Filter, a Mobile antenna and\nSWR/Power Meters... and stuff that died. I have owned and own many HF, VHF and\nUHF antennas and Mirage Amplifiers. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a dark day.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  13. Adam Ebel April 25, 2024 at 10:15 pm\n\nThe only stuff that I bought was a couple of books from the 2004 local hamfest\nand also got some free manuals from them in the past, and also a prize such as\nthe dual UTC clock, and some coffee mug that end up broke back in the day. The\nrest of the other stuff, I wanted to order one of those AM Transmitter kits,\nbut they kept telling me it was out of stock and it would take them weeks to\nget it back in stock. I wish they would continue staying in business for\ncurrent and future generations to come, and also offer some of their active\nantennas and accessories in a assemble and kit format such as the Vectronics\nActive Antenna kit and the MFJ-956 LW-MW-SW antenna preselector. Still, I want\nto get a chance to build one of those short wave regenerative radio receiver\nkits.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n    1. rtc April 26, 2024 at 5:40 pm\n\nAdam, MFJ\u2019s website shows they still have the MFJ 8100 in stock. In fact they\nstill offer the Vectronics clone (same rx) and for just $20 extra you can get\nthe wired version. It\u2019s not hard to build,about 2-3 hours if you take your\ntime. But for only $20 more,why not get the wired version? After all,it\u2019s only\nmoney.??\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  14. Adrian Waiblinger April 25, 2024 at 9:27 pm\n\nThat\u2019s sad for us and the workers but good for Martin. I still have my mfj\n1278 packet modem that I got many years ago. Such fond memories.\n\nHopefully someone may want to take over and continue the range.\n\nAll the best Martin, thanks for giving us toys.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  15. Alvin Norris April 25, 2024 at 8:36 pm\n\nFor years I always stopped to talk to Martin at the mfj booth. I rember once\nwhen we were talking I entioned that Iwasavig aprobem with the powerjac on one\nof my MFJ DEVICES. He pointed tone of his staff and he said, He will give you\nthe solution before you leave, and he did. Alvin\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  16. Steve April 25, 2024 at 8:19 pm\n\nI\u2019m surprised he chose to close the business, rather than sell it. It\u2019s a bit\nretro for today, but many hams remember his equipment very well. I owned\nseveral different xcvrs and antenna tuners that I used for many years. I\ndidn\u2019t get into the digital dials and more advanced rigs until the late \u201890s\nwith Elecraft. Before that I was strictly Heathkit until they folded. His\ncompany will be missed.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n    1. Frank April 26, 2024 at 6:57 am\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised he chose to close the business, rather than sell it.\u201d me too i\nam very surprise. I think if someone buy rights to build these equipment they\nunfortunatly will search for a place in Asian where salarys are not to high.\nYou can see now SW receiver are all made in China. Exeptept the very expenvive\nICOM who are very nice and i think made in Japan ? I am french iand its realy\nhard to have MADE IN FRANCE because a lot of cotisations for sociale security,\netc. Like 40 US Dollars for 1 hour of work to pay for the boss...\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  17. JOHN April 25, 2024 at 7:50 pm\n\nThat is very sad news .... Getting close to retirement, & was hoping to spend\na lot of time renewing my association with Ham Radio .... Now maybe it\u2019s not\ngoing to happen ?\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  18. Daniel A Robinson April 25, 2024 at 7:46 pm\n\nAnother huge loss after news about Wellbrook, and Telford closing. Time as a\nchanging. I was never a huge fan of MFJ as I thought their stuff was just OK,\nbut a few units were very good, especially in noise reduction and antenna\nequipment\n\nReply \u2193\n\n    1. rtc April 25, 2024 at 8:05 pm\n\nSo sad to hear. Like you I always thought their stuff was OK,satisfactory,etc.\nnot necessarily great but an awful lot of ham equipment was made only by\nthem,like the excellent MFJ-8100 regen receiver and other things. I\u2019ve told\nThomas for years the \u201cgrand old companies\u201d have been going away and they were\none of the last. Sure am glad I went ahead and got a scanner beam from\nthem...if anyone reading this is thinking about one of their products,now is\nthe time to proceed with the project.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n  19. Steve Searl April 25, 2024 at 7:13 pm\n\nThis is so sad but not totally surprising.
