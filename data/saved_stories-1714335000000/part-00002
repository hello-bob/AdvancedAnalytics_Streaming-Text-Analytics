But there\u2019s much that is left out. It\nis well-known that US efforts to build the bomb started years before physicist\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer took over as director of the Manhattan Project at Los\nAlamos Laboratory in New Mexico in 1943. That project was initiated by fellow\nphysicist Leo Szilard. Concerned by the pace at which nuclear-science\ndiscoveries were being made in Germany, Szilard persuaded Albert Einstein in\nAugust 1939 to write a letter to then-president Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning\nhim of the risk of an atomic bomb in Adolf Hitler\u2019s hands.\n\nBut Szilard wasn\u2019t the only physicist to try to use Einstein\u2019s prestige to\nalert the president. Viennese physicist Hans Thirring independently arrived at\nthe same idea. Thirring\u2019s attempt petered out, but deserves a footnote in\nhistory, if only because it involves none less than Kurt G\u00f6del in the\nunexpected role of a secret agent. The tale has all the trappings of an Alfred\nHitchcock movie.\n\n## Vienna Circle\n\nG\u00f6del, a mathematician and philosopher, was called by Einstein \u201cthe greatest\nlogician since Aristotle\u201d \u2014 a phrase coined in 1924 that stuck. Yet when Kurt\nenrolled at the University of Vienna 100 years ago, he started out in physics.\nRelativity was all the rage then, and G\u00f6del\u2019s professor, Hans Thirring, was an\nexpert. He had just co-discovered an important feature of the Universe \u2014 that\nthe gravitational field of a spinning ball (such as Earth) differs from that\nwhen the ball is still, now known as the Lense\u2013Thirring effect. The difference\nis tiny, however, and it wasn\u2019t measured until 80 years later, using first-\nrate space technology.\n\nThe avant-garde philosophers of the Vienna Circle, a group of self-appointed\nheralds of the scientific world view, also influenced G\u00f6del and turned his\nmind towards the foundations of mathematics. By age 25, he had discovered his\n\u2018incompleteness theorem\u2019, which states roughly that there is no consistent\nformal system in which all arithmetical propositions can be proved. This was\nan epoch-making result.\n\nG\u00f6del became one of the first postdocs to be invited to the newly founded\nInstitute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. But when he returned\nfrom the United States to Vienna in 1934, he had a nervous breakdown. Indeed,\nbouts of persecution mania and fears of poisoning would dog him for the rest\nof his life. Thus, during the 1930s, G\u00f6del shuttled between seminars in\nVienna, the Institute for Advanced Study and mental-health clinics.\n\nWhy Oppenheimer has important lessons for scientists today\n\nHis mathematical work shifted to \u2018set theory\u2019, especially the theory of\ninfinites. And again, he achieved a landmark result. He obsessively pursued\nthe \u2018continuum hypothesis\u2019, which states roughly that the infinitude of real\nnumbers is next largest to that of natural numbers. G\u00f6del managed to show that\nthis hypothesis is compatible with the axioms of set theory \u2014 a brilliant\nfeat. His shorthand notebooks from that period, which are currently being\ndeciphered and published, show that he pursued in parallel a stupendous range\nof interests, including parapsychology and quantum mechanics \u2014 two fields that\nalso engrossed his former physics professor, with whom he had never lost\ntouch.\n\nThirring was charismatic, popular with his students and brim-full of ideas. He\nhad invented a cape-like \u2018hover-coat\u2019 for skiers and held a patent on films\nwith sound. He, too, was in close touch with the hard-nosed \u2018positivists\u2019 of\nthe Vienna Circle, who thought that knowledge comes only from experience and\nlogical analysis. But this did not dampen Thirring\u2019s interest in paranormal\nphenomena.\n\nTo hold a truly scientific world view, one must be ready to swim against the\nmainstream. This applies to political tides, too: Thirring was one of the\nwoefully few in Vienna to stand up firmly against the flood of Nazi students\nafter Hitler came to power. The \u2018brownshirt\u2019 storm troopers \u2014 the paramilitary\nwing of the Nazi Party \u2014 could not accuse him of being of Jewish descent, but\nhis support of Einstein (who was Jewish) was bad enough in their eyes. And in\n1938, as soon as Austria was annexed to the Third Reich, 50-year-old Thirring\nlost his professorial chair. But he did not lose contact with former\ncolleagues. And he was well aware that, in physics labs everywhere, everyone\nwas talking about nuclear fission \u2014 the division of the atomic nucleus and the\nresulting release of energy \u2014 which had just been discovered in Hitler\u2019s\nBerlin.\n\n## Mounting concern\n\nIn the summer of 1939, after reading an article in the scientific journal Die\nNaturwissenschaften by Siegfried Fl\u00fcgge \u2014 later a leading member of\nUranverein, the ominous \u2018Uranium Club\u2019 that was behind the German effort to\nbuild a nuclear bomb \u2014 Thirring had learnt enough to feel that the US\ngovernment should be warned. Like Szilard, and at about the same time, he came\nup with the idea to use Einstein to alert Roosevelt. But how could Thirring\ncontact Einstein? The Gestapo, the Nazi secret police force, would intercept\nevery phone call or letter from Vienna to Princeton, where Einstein lived.\n\nThis is when Thirring heard that G\u00f6del happened to be on a brief visit to\nVienna, to see his mother and take his wife Adele back with him to Princeton.\nWhy not use G\u00f6del as a secret messenger to reach Einstein? Thirring entrusted\nG\u00f6del confidentially with the task of warning Einstein about Hitler\u2019s bomb.\n\nUnfortunately, the plan proved ill-fated. G\u00f6del\u2019s departure was delayed for\nnearly four months by an avalanche of bureaucratic hurdles. At times, escape\nlooked hopeless.\n\nDifficulties and chicanery piled up. After Germany annexed Austria, G\u00f6del\nautomatically became a German citizen, and had to return his old passport. The\nvisa for multiple re-entry into the United States was in the old passport, and\nthe hopelessly overtaxed US consulate could not simply transfer it to the new\none. G\u00f6del had to re-apply to enter the United States, and thus join a queue\nof thousands who were desperately trying to escape from the Reich.\n\nG\u00f6del had also lost his lectureship, and thus his professorial status. The\nNazis were re-structuring academic life, and G\u00f6del\u2019s former contacts aroused\ntheir suspicion. Would he be able to represent \u2018New Germany\u2019 abroad? A minor\nbureaucrat had found fault with G\u00f6del\u2019s previous journey to the United States;\nthe revenue service questioned the few hundred dollars on his account. It\nseemed he was of Aryan descent, but where was his grandparents\u2019 marriage\ncertificate, and that of his wife\u2019s grandparents? Administration ran amok.\n\nAs one Viennese eye-witness, the writer Leo Perutz, described it: \u201cObscure\noffices that no one had ever heard of before would suddenly emerge from\nhiding, would make their demands imperiously known, and would insist on being\nsatisfied, or at least noticed and consulted.\u201d\n\nG\u00f6del and his wife had moved out of their flat in September \u2014 but because they\ncouldn\u2019t leave the country as planned, they had to look urgently for new\nlodgings. On top of it all, a mustering commission of the German armed forces,\nthe Wehrmacht, declared G\u00f6del fit for garrison duty. It was like a bad dream.\nIndeed, many years later, he would still be plagued by nightmares about being\ntrapped in Vienna.\n\n## Perilous flight\n\nIn the end, thanks to vigorous interventions by mathematician John von Neumann\nand others at the Institute for Advanced Study, the visas came through in\nearly January 1940. By then, Hitler\u2019s troops had overrun Poland, and Europe\nwas torn apart by war. The United States wasn\u2019t involved yet, and some neutral\nvessels still plied the Atlantic Ocean. However, they were routinely searched\nby Allied warships, and all German passengers were sent to internment camps.\nOn top of that, there was the risk of running through the periscope sight of a\ntrigger-happy German U-boat skipper. Obviously, an Atlantic crossing would not\ndo.\n\nThe only way out was the other way around: eastward, through Siberia and the\nPacific. A tight-rope act, but just feasible. The Soviet Union and Japan were\nboth waging wars, but not against Germany, or the United States, or each\nother.\n\nThirring\u2019s plan was still alive, and on the eve of G\u00f6del\u2019s departure, the\ndauntless physicist met him and relayed the secret message. It was by no means\nsure that it would reach its destination. At each hitch, the G\u00f6dels risked\nbeing stopped. They had a long way to go.\n\nTo Berlin first, for some final stamps on their documents. From there, across\nhalf of Prussia, to reach occupied Poland, with its bombed railway stations\nand baleful troop transports clustering the sidings. On through twilight\nLatvia and Lithuania, and into Joseph Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union. Each border\ncrossing took hours. Each luggage search was nerve-racking, and each knock on\nthe compartment door was ill-boding. Finally in Moscow, the G\u00f6dels spent a\nnight in the gigantic Hotel Metropol, a gloomy block housing mostly Communist\nParty delegates, some anxiously awaiting their upcoming trials for disloyalty.\nThese were the heydays of communist purges and spy scares.\n\nHow Viennese scientists fought the dogma, propaganda and prejudice of the\n1930s\n\nAt Yaroslavski station in central Moscow, the G\u00f6dels boarded the Trans-\nSiberian Express. Its other terminus was more than 9,000 kilometres away, in\nVladivostok. During the seemingly endless nights of ice and snow, the train\naccumulated a colossal delay. After finally reaching Vladivostok, they had to\ntake a ship \u2014 often running behind schedule \u2014 to Yokohama, Japan. While in\nBerlin, G\u00f6del and Adele had booked a cabin in the SS President Taft for the\nleg from Yokohama to San Francisco, California. Inevitably, they missed the\nocean liner, and had to wait for two weeks for the next one, the SS President\nCleveland.\n\nOnce aboard, things started picking up. A day\u2019s stopover in sight of Oahu,\nHawaii, came as a welcome change from icy Siberian train platforms. The coast\nof California rising from the horizon was the climax. Years later, G\u00f6del would\nstill enthuse: \u201cSan Francisco is absolutely the most beautiful city I have\never seen.\u201d There was just one last formality before landing: the immigration\npapers, with their obnoxious queries \u2014 \u201cHave you ever been a patient in an\ninstitution for the care and treatment of the insane?\u201d No.\n\nAnother railway ticket; another trans-continental ride, now in an elegant\nPullman sleeper train; and the safe haven of Princeton at last, after almost\ntwo months of travelling. G\u00f6del\u2019s long-time friend, economist Oskar\nMorgenstern, reported in his diary on 12 March 1940: \u201cG\u00f6del arrived. This time\nwith wife. Via Siberia. When asked about Vienna: The coffee is wretched!\u201d\n\nAfter having circled three-quarters of the globe, G\u00f6del had reached Einstein\u2019s\ndoorstep. He could finally fulfil his mission. Despite all obstacles,\nThirring\u2019s message had arrived. Quite conceivably, it could save the world.\n\nAnd this is where G\u00f6del failed.\n\nHe confessed it to Thirring more than three decades later: on meeting\nEinstein, G\u00f6del had not transmitted the warning, but merely \u201cgreetings from\nThirring\u201d. The bizarre excuse: he, G\u00f6del, had felt that a nuclear chain\nreaction would be possible only \u201cin a distant future\u201d.\n\n## Lost legacy\n\nWhat did Thirring make of this? We can only wonder. He had outlasted the Third\nReich unbowed, reassumed his professorship and become one of the firmest\nvoices against nuclear armament. By then, however, Einstein\u2019s letter to\nRoosevelt, prompted by Szilard, was public knowledge. Thirring\u2019s son Walter,\nwho was also a theoretical physicist and a colleague of mine in Vienna, later\ntold me that his father was always uneasy about his (imagined) role in the\nbomb project. Hans, who was an inveterate pacifist, saw himself as a link in\nthe causal chain that had led to the horrors of the atom bombs dropped on\nHiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in 1945. Only in 1972, shortly before his\ndeath and already weakened by a stroke, did he learn that his message had\nnever reached its goal.\n\nAs a secret agent, G\u00f6del had proved a dud. But then again, fortunately, the\nspectre of Hitler\u2019s atomic bomb had turned out to be no great shakes either.\n\nNature 627, 26-28 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00644-1\n\n### Updates & Corrections\n\n  * Correction 20 March 2024: Owing to a late editorial change, the originally published text of this Essay made an erroneous statement about the nature of the continuum hypothesis, and stated mistakenly that Hans Thirring had lost contact with former colleagues.\n\n### Competing Interests\n\nThe author declares no competing interests.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * How Einstein built on the past to make his breakthroughs\n\n  * How Viennese scientists fought the dogma, propaganda and prejudice of the 1930s\n\n  * Born secret \u2014 the heavy burden of bomb physics\n\n  * The scientist-spy who spilt secrets of the bomb\n\n  * The doubly dextrous physics of Enrico Fermi\n\n  * Dreaming of the bomb\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Physics\n  * History\n  * Nuclear physics\n\n## Latest on:\n\nJudge dismisses superconductivity physicist\u2019s lawsuit against university\n\nNews 25 APR 24\n\nRobust optical clocks promise stable timing in a portable package\n\nNews & Views 24 APR 24\n\nProbing entanglement in a 2D hard-core Bose\u2013Hubbard lattice\n\nArticle 24 APR 24\n\nAncient DNA traces family lines and political shifts in the Avar empire\n\nNews & Views 24 APR 24\n\nNetwork of large pedigrees reveals social practices of Avar communities\n\nArticle 24 APR 24\n\nCharles Darwin investigates: the curious case of primrose punishment\n\nNews & Views 23 APR 24\n\nLaser spectroscopy of triply charged 229Th isomer for a nuclear clock\n\nArticle 17 APR 24\n\nThe science of Oppenheimer: meet the Oscar-winning movie\u2019s specialist advisers\n\nNews Q&A 11 MAR 24\n\nSpace and nuclear pioneers show the value of empowering women in STEM\n\nCorrespondence 05 MAR 24\n\nJudge dismisses superconductivity physicist\u2019s lawsuit against university\n\nNews 25 APR 24\n\nRobust optical clocks promise stable timing in a portable package\n\nNews & Views 24 APR 24\n\nProbing entanglement in a 2D hard-core Bose\u2013Hubbard lattice\n\nArticle 24 APR 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### Professor\n\ntest\n\nBerlin (DE)\n\nSpringer Nature Group\n\n  * #### ECUST Seeking Global Talents\n\nJoin Us and Create a Bright Future Together!\n\nShanghai, China\n\nEast China University of Science and Technology (ECUST)\n\n  * #### Position Recruitment of Guangzhou Medical University\n\nSeeking talents around the world.\n\nGuangzhou, Guangdong, China\n\nGuangzhou Medical University\n\n  * #### Junior Group Leader\n\nThe Imagine Institute is a leading European research centre dedicated to\ngenetic diseases, with the primary objective to better understand and trea...\n\nParis, Ile-de-France (FR)\n\nImagine Institute\n\n  * #### Director of the Czech Advanced Technology and Research Institute of Palack\u00fd University Olomouc\n\nThe Rector of Palack\u00fd University Olomouc announces a Call for the Position of\nDirector of the Czech Advanced Technology and Research Institute of P...\n\nCzech Republic (CZ)\n\nPalack\u00fd University Olomouc\n\nDownload PDF\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * How Einstein built on the past to make his breakthroughs\n\n  * How Viennese scientists fought the dogma, propaganda and prejudice of the 1930s\n\n  * Born secret \u2014 the heavy burden of bomb physics\n\n  * The scientist-spy who spilt secrets of the bomb\n\n  * The doubly dextrous physics of Enrico Fermi\n\n  * Dreaming of the bomb\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Physics\n  * History\n  * Nuclear physics\n\n## Sign up to Nature Briefing\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your\ninbox every weekday.\n\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter \u2014 what matters in science, free to\nyour inbox daily.\n\nGet the most important science stories of the day, free in your inbox.
