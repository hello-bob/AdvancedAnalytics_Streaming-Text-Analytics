When not in Bangkok, she\ncollaborates with a friend to obtain products or contacts suppliers directly.\n\nShe promotes the goods on Instagram and buys ads there. She also puts her\nproduct catalog on WhatsApp groups and e-commerce platforms like Shopee. She\nusually transports the wares via cargo from Bangkok to her residence near\nJakarta before shipping them nationwide.\n\n\"Our [customs] regulations are getting stricter and stricter now,\" she said.\n\nJakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Indonesian officials are\nseeking to tighten surveillance at ports of entry and further enforce\nregulations covering goods imported by individuals. (Photo by Ken Kobayashi)\n\nIndeed, jastip has caught the attention of Indonesian authorities, and recent\ngovernment actions could restrict it. A regulation enacted in March stipulates\nsome personal import limits on electronic gadgets -- including cell phones and\ntablet computers. But Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan said in the same month\nthat the regulation has received complaints and would be evaluated.\n\nIn a statement in March, the customs office at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta\nInternational Airport said each passenger can bring in 5 kilograms of food\nitems. The office said that in 33 enforcement actions, it had destroyed around\na ton of milk buns from Thailand, worth about 400 million rupiah ($25,000),\nbecause they lacked Indonesian food certification.\n\nDiane Cahyono said she usually sends cargo shipments of around 50 to 100\nkilograms at a time, paying 95,000 to 125,000 rupiah per kilogram, which\nincludes customs duties.\n\nHer pricing depends on product size and availability and the distance traveled\nto get it, and excludes local shipping fees. The more effort it takes to get a\nproduct, the higher her price.\n\n\"This is a dilemma because I am in a position as a seller who really uses\nforeign products,\" she said. \"Who does not want to love local products? But\nthe dilemma is that at the same price, the quality is indeed different.\"\n\nSome businesses and experts are critical of jastip.\n\nBhima Yudhistira Adhinegara, director of the Jakarta-based Center of Economic\nand Law Studies, cites the practice's \"big negative impact on domestic\nplayers,\" as customers can try \"imported goods without going through\ncomplicated procedures and expensive import duties.\"\n\nMilk buns on sale in Bangkok. Indonesian customs authorities have destroyed\nsuch buns brought from Thailand for lacking Indonesian food certification.\n(Photo by Devin Jimie)\n\nHe said: \"Jastip needs to be monitored more closely because it has become a\ncompetitor of similar products in the country. If it is allowed to continue,\nit will take up a large domestic market niche.\" Besides affecting business\ncompetitiveness, he cited the burden of \"loss of income from import duties.\"\n\nHe estimated the daily value of jastip transactions at 5 billion to 6 billion\nrupiah, adding that 80% of the total is \"illegal jastip, which did not comply\nwith regulations and did not pay import duties and excise\" taxes.\n\n\"Legal import tariffs can reach 40%, meaning the country loses a potential\nincome of 1.6 billion rupiah per day,\" he told Nikkei.\n\nAnna, who did not want to give her full name, has been involved with jastip\nbetween Indonesia and China since 2018, promoting items on WeChat, WhatsApp\nand Instagram. She delivers them using 50 or 60 kilograms of hand-carried\nluggage per passenger or cargo flight and pays the required taxes.\n\nShe provides customers in Indonesia with goods from China like smartwatches\nand lifestyle items from the discount retailer Miniso that are not available\nin Indonesia. She also brings products from Indonesia -- such as an herbal\nremedy and a stomach ulcer medicine -- for Indonesian students in China as\nwell as products like cigarettes and coffee beans for Chinese.\n\n\"Students have limited money, so using [global courier] DHL is expensive for\nthem. We are cheaper, so that helps,\" she said.\n\nAnna charges a jastip fee worth 200,000 rupiah per kilogram, although for some\nlarger goods she sets pricing per item. Her service runs every two weeks,\nworking with nine to 10 people in charge of delivering, receiving or packaging\nthe goods.\n\nShe makes a profit of around 16 million to 17 million rupiah for every two-way\ntrip after deducting the costs of flights and accommodations. She declined to\ndisclose the fees for her couriers -- Indonesian university students flying\nhome and back -- but said they receive 4 million to 10 million rupiah per\ntrip, depending on the number of orders.\n\nAnna expressed irritation at the government's effort to crack down on jastip:\n\"Indonesia makes regulations for [small] stuff like this, like there are no\nother [pressing] regulations.\"\n\nShe added that taking Indonesian goods to China actually makes up a bigger\nproportion of her business and she sees jastip as a way to help introduce\nIndonesian products abroad.\n\n\"In my case, Indonesia-China had more traffic than China-Indonesia, so more\nexports than imports. The Chinese themselves love [Indonesian products], as do\nWesterners [in China].\"\n\n## Read Next\n\n  * The Big Story\n\n#### From Grab to GoTo, Southeast Asia's startups weather funding winter\n\n  * Japan immigration\n\n#### Indonesians, Vietnamese form larger share of Japan's foreign workers\n\n  * Retail\n\n#### Indonesia outlet malls draw middle-class fans of Adidas, Coach\n\n  * Travel & Leisure\n\n#### Taiwan seeks more tourists from Indonesia\n\n  * Belt and Road\n\n#### Chinese investment in Asia rose 37% in 2023, led by Indonesia\n\n## Latest On Business trends\n\n  * Business trends\n\n#### Health-conscious Vietnamese wary of Japan's red yeast rice problem\n\n  * Business trends\n\n#### Japanese 100-yen shop president says penny-pinching mindset persists\n\n  * Business trends\n\n#### Singapore loses shine as Southeast Asia base for multinationals\n\n## Sponsored Content\n\n### About Sponsored Content This content was commissioned by Nikkei's Global\nBusiness Bureau.\n\nDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia app\n\n#### Get Insights on Asia in your inbox\n\nRegister for our newsletters\n\n#### Connect With Us\n\nNikkei Inc.
