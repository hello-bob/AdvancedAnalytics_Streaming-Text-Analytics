It says that the leftist approach to government creates inequality\nthat far exceeds the inequality produced by the market. And it says that the\npower wielded by government officials far exceeds their intelligence. I\nsuggest ways to break up the concentration of political power.\n\n####\n\nConcentration of Political Power\n\nThere was a joke that I heard growing up during the Cold War. Under\ncapitalism, man exploits man. Under Communism, it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nI argue that we need to pay attention to political inequality, not just market\ninequality. In fact, our political system creates its own form of extreme\ninequality. Consider measuring the inequality of power in our political system\nby looking at budget power.\n\n> Montgomery County, Maryland, where I live, has a budget of $4.3 billion,\n> which is allocated by a nine-member County Council...almost $500 million per\n> legislator, every year...\n>\n> ...in 2007, only four executives were paid as much as $100 million.\n>\n> ...If you had a fortune of $10 billion and earned five percent in interest,\n> this would give you $500 million per year to spend...only 83 people in the\n> world, including only 28 American citizens, have as much wealth at their\n> disposal as a member of the Montgomery County Council.\n\nAt the time, dividing the Federal budget by the number of people in Congress\ngave a figure of $5.5 billion per year. Spending on \u201cearmarks\u201d (that is,\nspending directly controlled by one Federal legislator) alone was $30 million\nper year. At the time, having an income of $30 million per year would have put\nyou in the top one hundredth of one percent of the income distribution.\n\nDividing a jurisdiction\u2019s budget by the number of legislators is a crude\nmeasure of the legislator\u2019s power. But it is more likely to be an under-\nestimate than an over-estimate.\n\n> They also can enact mandates, laws, and regulations that do not directly\n> increase spending but still exert authority over citizens.\n\nThe unmistakable trend over the past one hundred years is for the power\nexercised by a small set of people has increased. One example is the Federal\nReserve, which before the 2008 financial crisis had a balance sheet of just\nunder $1 trillion and now has a balance sheet of nearly $9 trillion.\n\nWithin our democracy, power has become more unequal. Ordinary voters have much\nless influence than they used to, as population has grown while the size of\nCongress has remained fixed.\n\n> In 1910, there were fewer than 200,000 people per legislator. Today [2007]\n> there are more than 500,000 people per legislator.\n>\n> Los Angeles County...local government has almost 2 million people per\n> legislator.\n\n####\n\nToo much power, too little knowledge\n\nWhile power has become more concentrated, knowledge has become more dispersed.\nIn the economy, people are increasingly specialized. Science, medicine, and\nengineering have split into smaller sub-disciplines\n\nIn general, policy makers have too little knowledge relative to the high\nconcentration of power. Consider the bills passed in Congress that run to\nhundreds of pages, which is more than they can read. And often the bills\nmerely delegate power to unelected officials in government agencies.\n\nConcerning the financial crisis of 2008, I wrote,\n\n> The failure to regulate in time was not due to a lack of tools. Nor was it\n> due to a lack of will...The failure to prevent the crisis was due to the\n> lack of knowledge among key policymakers.\n\nWhen it came to managing systemic risk in housing finance, the regulators\nthought that securitization was the solution. In fact, it turned out to be the\nproblem.\n\nIn the book, I contrast this high concentration of power without knowledge to\nthe way that the Internet works, in comparison with legacy newspapers, radio,\nand television.\n\n> As a medium, it is more democratic, allowing more people to disseminate\n> information. Internet governance is much less intrusive than ordinary\n> government. The Internet thereby provides an example showing that minimalist\n> government can produce richly rewarding outcomes. Finally, by facilitating\n> collaboration and spontaneous production of public goods, the Internet can\n> enable groups to provide substitutes for the work of centralized government.\n\nI did not anticipate the growth of social media, which has given rise to new\nquestions about concentration of power. But it still seems dubious that\nincreased government power over social media would be the solution to whatever\nproblems are caused by the way that information spreads on the Internet.\n\n####\n\nHow to Decentralize Power\n\nIf I am correct that power has become far too concentrated, what structural\nreforms could change that?\n\nOne approach is to arrange government by function, rather than by territorial\nmonopoly.\n\n> There might be an elementary education unit, a fire protection unit, a\n> garbage collection unit, and so forth. The territories of these different\n> units could overlap. The fire protection unit serving my house could have a\n> different territory from the garbage collection unit serving my house.\n\nThis separation of functions could expose more functions to competition. It\nwould\n\n> give individuals a lot of choice about which services they want and\n> approximately how much they are willing to pay for them.\n\nI propose that government provision of services be replaced by vouchers.\nVouchers would be used not just for education but for health care and other\nsocial services.\n\nI also propose that neighborhoods be allowed to obtain charters to purchase\nservices, such as garbage collection or fire protection. Shifting decisions\nfrom a city or county level to a neighborhood level would reduce concentration\nof power.\n\nAnother idea is competitive regulation.\n\n> For example, instead of having a county or city issue restaurant licenses,\n> there could be private licensing agencies. Some consumers might prefer\n> restaurants licensed by a particular agency...Other consumers might prefer a\n> different agency\n\nA lot of the book rests on my view that Internet technology is a better match\nfor decentralized government than for concentrated power. Sounding like Martin\nGurri or Balaji Srinivasan, I conclude,\n\n> At the moment, the political stars are aligned to favor greater\n> concentration of government power. However, I doubt that this political\n> trend will be able to overcome the structural trend of greater diffusion of\n> information.\n>\n> Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps what appears to me to be a high concentration of\n> political power is mitigated by forces that I have overlooked. Or perhaps I\n> am misreading the technological trends, and in fact new information and\n> communication systems give the advantage to central planning...\n>\n> I do not claim to have settled the issue of what, if anything, should be\n> done about concentrated political power. My hope is that this book will help\n> provoke further discussion of this neglected but crucial topic.\n\nFor the left, concentration of political power is a non-issue. For me, that\nmakes their concerns with inequality come across as unfocused at best and\nphony at worst.\n\nShare\n\nsubstacks referenced above:\n\n@\n\nSlow Boring\n\nWhat the left gets right\n\nIn the first post of this series, I defended the utility of the general\nleft/right political dichotomy and offered a little sketch of its history\nacross the past two centuries.

The\nLeft's worship of unconstrained power is based on their unrealistic view of\nthe perfectibility of human nature, and their eschatological na\u00efve belief in\nthe possibility of a collective rational or technocratic management of human\naffairs so as to ward off tragedy and contingency from life. Those who are not\nblind to human fallibility instead want to see institutions that limit the\nexercise of power so as to prevent tyranny, which is always the end result of\nLeftist power. The Left's supposed disdain for hierarchy is hypocritical; they\nare only opposed to hierarchies which they do not control and which limit\ntheir power. And since this post is talking about power without knowledge, it\nwould be well to mention the late Jeffrey Friedman's book of exactly that\ntitle, which demonstrates the futility of technocratic rule.Expand full\ncommentLike (7)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nstu5 hrs ago\u00b7edited 2 hrs ago\"One approach is to arrange government by\nfunction, rather than by territorial monopoly.\"Huh. To me this seems like the\nperfect way to give special interests even more power. Aren't schools pretty\nmuch entirely a separate entity governed by function? How is that working out?\nWhat am I missing?\"I also propose that neighborhoods be allowed to obtain\ncharters to purchase services, such as garbage collection or fire\nprotection.\"Again, I'm a little perplexed. Sticking with education, you want\nto tell me how my kids are better off in one of the smaller of the ~850 school\ndistricts in Illinois versus the 25 school districts in Maryland?\"I propose\nthat government provision of services be replaced by vouchers.\"I have no clue\nhow this would work. Or help.\"I also propose that neighborhoods be allowed to\nobtain charters to purchase services, such as garbage collection or fire\nprotection. Shifting decisions from a city or county level to a neighborhood\nlevel would reduce concentration of power.\"This seems a different direction\nthan vouchers but ok. Getting back to schools, we have rich school districts\nnext to poor school districts. It's a problem. And you want to make more\ngovernment services like this? How do you propose to divide up the large\nbusinesses that pay lots of taxes?I generally like the way you think and agree\nwith you A LOT but I really don't think you've thought this through. It seems\nto me you are only looking at the benefits of your preferred approaches and\n(especially) none of the pitfalls while looking at the status quo with exactly\nthe opposite blinders.Expand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n22 more comments...\n\nThe Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\nWhy don't more women use it?\n\nSep 24, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n50\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Strategy of Dating Short Men\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n111\n\nI Condemn. . .But\n\nThe worst form of evil\n\nOct 14, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n99\n\nShare this post\n\n#### I Condemn. . .But\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n80\n\nAssimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\nWe have not done it well\n\nMay 10, 2023 \u2022\n\nArnold Kling\n\n65\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Assimilating Women into Male Institutions\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n61\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Arnold Kling\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
