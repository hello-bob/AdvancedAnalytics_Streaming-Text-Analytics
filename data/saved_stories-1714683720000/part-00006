The\n5.34-petaflop supercomputer ranked as the 20th most powerful in the world at\nthe time of its installation in 2016. Bidding started at $2,500, but it's\nprice is currently $27,643 with the reserve not yet met.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nKing under the mountain: Building Colorado\u2019s Cold War command center\n\nThe supercomputer, which officially operated between January 12, 2017, and\nDecember 31, 2023, at the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center, was a powerful\n(and once considered energy-efficient) system that significantly advanced\natmospheric and Earth system sciences research.\n\n\"In its lifetime, Cheyenne delivered over 7 billion core-hours, served over\n4,400 users, and supported nearly 1,300 NSF awards,\" writes the University\nCorporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) on its official Cheyenne\ninformation page. \"It played a key role in education, supporting more than 80\nuniversity courses and training events. Nearly 1,000 projects were awarded for\nearly-career graduate students and postdocs. Perhaps most tellingly, Cheyenne-\npowered research generated over 4,500 peer-review publications, dissertations\nand theses, and other works.\"\n\nUCAR says that Cheynne was originally slated to be replaced after five years,\nbut the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted supply chains, and it clocked in\ntwo extra years in its tour of duty. The auction page says that Cheyenne\nrecently experienced maintenance limitations due to faulty quick disconnects\nin its cooling system. As a result, approximately 1 percent of the compute\nnodes have failed, primarily due to ECC errors in the DIMMs. Given the expense\nand downtime associated with repairs, the decision was made to auction off the\ncomponents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * A photo gallery of the Cheyenne supercomputer up for auction.\n\nUS General Services Administration\n\n  * US General Services Administration\n\n  * US General Services Administration\n\n  * US General Services Administration\n\n  * US General Services Administration\n\n  * US General Services Administration\n\n  * US General Services Administration\n\n  * US General Services Administration\n\n  * US General Services Administration\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nWith a peak performance of 5,340 teraflops (4,788 Linpack teraflops), this SGI\nICE XA system was capable of performing over 3 billion calculations per second\nfor every watt of energy consumed, making it three times more energy-efficient\nthan its predecessor, Yellowstone. The system featured 4,032 dual-socket\nnodes, each with two 18-core, 2.3-GHz Intel Xeon E5-2697v4 processors, for a\ntotal of 145,152 CPU cores. It also included 313 terabytes of memory and 40\npetabytes of storage. The entire system in operation consumed about 1.7\nmegawatts of power.\n\nJust to compare, the world's top-rated supercomputer at the moment\u2014Frontier at\nOak Ridge National Labs in Tennessee\u2014features a theoretical peak performance\nof 1,679.82 petaflops, includes 8,699,904 CPU cores, and uses 22.7 megawatts\nof power.\n\n### Further Reading\n\n1.1 quintillion operations per second: US has world\u2019s fastest supercomputer\n\nThe GSA notes that potential buyers of Cheyenne should be aware that\nprofessional movers with appropriate equipment will be required to handle the\nheavy racks and components. The auction includes seven E-Cell pairs (14\ntotal), each with a cooling distribution unit (CDU). Each E-Cell weighs\napproximately 1,500 lbs. Additionally, the auction features two air-cooled\nCheyenne Management Racks, each weighing 2,500 lbs, that contain servers,\nswitches, and power units.\n\nAs of this writing, 12 potential buyers have bid on this computing monster so\nfar. The auction closes on May 5 at 6:11 pm Central Time if you're interested\nin bidding. But don't get too excited by photos of the extensive cabling: As\nthe auction site notes, \"fiber optic and CAT5/6 cabling are excluded from the\nresale package.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n204\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
