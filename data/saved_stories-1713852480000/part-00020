A rural Oregon city asks the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case started in the rural Oregon town of Grants Pass, which began fining\npeople US$295 for sleeping outside as the cost of housing escalated and tents\nsprung up in the city\u2019s public parks. The San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit\nCourt of Appeals struck down the law under its holding that banning camping in\nplaces without enough shelter beds amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe justices appeared to be leaning toward a narrow ruling in the case after\nhearing arguments that showed the stark terms of the debate over homelessness\nin Western states like California, which is home to one-third of the country's\nhomeless population.\n\nSleeping is a biological necessity, and people may be forced to do it outside\nif they can't get housing or there's no space in shelters, Justice Sonia\nSotomayor said.\n\n\u201cWhere do we put them if every city, every village, every town lacks\ncompassion and passes a law identical to this? Where are they supposed to\nsleep? Are they supposed to kill themselves, not sleeping?\" she said.\n\nSolving homelessness is a complicated issue, said Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He\nquestioned whether ticketing people for camping helps if there aren't enough\nshelter beds to hold everyone, but also raised concerns about federal courts\n\u201cmicromanaging\u201d policy.\n\nOther conservative justices asked how far Eighth Amendment legal protections\nshould extend as cities struggle with managing homeless encampments that can\nbe dangerous and unsanitary.\n\n\u201cHow about if there are no public bathroom facilities, do people have an\nEighth Amendment right to defecate and urinate outdoors?\u201d said Justice Neil\nGorsuch.\n\nOther public-health laws cover that situation, Justice Department attorney\nEdwin Kneedler said. He argued people shouldn\u2019t be punished just for sleeping\noutside, but said the ruling striking down the Grants Pass law should be\ntossed out because the court didn't do enough to determine if people are\n\u201cinvoluntarily homeless.\u201d\n\nGorsuch and other justices also raised the possibility that other aspects of\nstate or federal law could help sort through the issue, potentially without\nsetting sweeping new legal precedent.\n\nThe question is an urgent one in the West, where a cross-section of Democratic\nand Republican officials contend that the 9th Circuit's rulings on camping\nbans make it difficult for them to manage encampments. The appeals court has\njurisdiction over nine states in the West.\n\nAdvocacy groups, on the other hand, argued that allowing cities to punish\npeople who need a place to sleep will criminalize homelessness and ultimately\nmake the crisis worse as the cost of housing increases.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the Supreme Court Monday morning to\nadvocate for more affordable housing, holding silver thermal blankets and\nsigns like \u201chousing not handcuffs.\u201d\n\n  * Read more of the latest international headlines(opens in a new tab)\n\nHomelessness in the United States grew a dramatic 12 per cent last year to its\nhighest reported level, as soaring rents and a decline in coronavirus pandemic\nassistance combined to put housing out of reach for more people.\n\nMore than 650,000 people are estimated to be homeless, the most since the\ncountry began using the yearly point-in-time survey in 2007. Nearly half of\nthem sleep outside. Older adults, LGBTQ2S+ people and people of color are\ndisproportionately affected, advocates said.\n\nIn Oregon, a lack of mental health and addiction resources has also helped\nfuel the crisis. The state has some of the highest rates of homelessness and\ndrug addiction in the nation, and ranks near the bottom in access to\ntreatment, federal data shows.\n\nThe court is expected to decide the case by the end of June.\n\nRush reported from Portland, Oregon.\n\nReport an error\n\nEditorial standards & policies\n\nWhy you can trust CTV News\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## RELATED STORIES\n\n  * Quebec lawsuit could limit dismantling of homeless camps in the province\n\n  * Advocate slams 'draconian' changes proposed to Vancouver bylaw on sheltering in parks\n\n  * Can homeless people be fined for sleeping outside?
