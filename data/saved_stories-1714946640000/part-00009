Perhaps one overlooked benefit though was in relation to mental\nhealth, specifically of those tasked with making alphabet books. How did they\nrepresent the letter X before X-rays? Xylophones, which have also been a\npopular choice through the twentieth century to today, are mysteriously absent\nin older works. Perhaps explained by the fact that, although around for\nmillennia, the instrument didn't gain popularity in the West (with the name of\n\u201cxylophone\u201d) until the early twentieth century. So to what solutions did our\nindustrious publishers turn?\n\nAs we see below, in addition to drawing on names \u2014 be it historical figures,\nplants, or animals, all mostly of a Greek bent (X being there much more\ncommon) \u2014 there's also some more inventive approaches. And some wonderfully\nlazy ones too.\n\n## Xerxes, Xantippe, and more...\n\nAs a figure of note, you might hope it would be your epic accomplishments that\nwould lead to your name being uttered by students for millennia to come \u2014 not\nfor the coincidence of the tricky letter with which your name began. But so it\nwas for the Persian king Xerxes, who in the field of nineteenth-century\nalphabet books achieved what he could never quite achieve in fifth-century-BC\nAthens: domination. Though there was perhaps some solace in that he was likely\nthe very first historical figure of which many a child would learn.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nThe Lu Lu Alphabet (1867) by Pamela Atkins Colman \u2014 Source.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nThe Comic Alphabet (1847) by Percy Cruikshank \u2014 Source.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nFootsteps on the Road to Learning, or, The Alphabet in Rhyme (1849) \u2014 Source.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nNonsense Books (1888) by Edward Lear \u2014 Source.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nThe \"Union\" Alphabet for Children (1862) \u2014 Source.\n\nXanthippe, the supposedly \u201cfiery\u201d wife of Socrates also gets a good look in,\noften shown in a rage pouring a chamber pot over her husband's head, which \u2014\naccording to legend \u2014 the philosopher accepted with a simple \u201cAfter thunder\ncomes the rain\u201d.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nComic Alphabet (1836) by George Cruikshank \u2014 Source.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nThe Royal Picture Alphabet (ca. 1855) by John Leighton \u2014 Source.\n\nOther historical figures too can be seen to rise through the ranks of their\nlesser initialed contemporaries.
