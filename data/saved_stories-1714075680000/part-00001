Need more be said?'\n\nNews\n\nBy Andy Chalk\n\npublished 13 hours ago\n\nFans aren't happy, as you can imagine.\n\n(Image credit: Facepunch Studios)\n\nFollowing a takedown request issued by Nintendo, the famed physics sandbox\nGarry's Mod is removing \"all Nintendo related stuff\" from its Steam Workshop.\n\n\"Some of you may have noticed that certain Nintendo related workshop items\nhave recently been taken down,\" Facepunch Studios said in a Steam update.\n\"This is not a mistake, the takedowns came from Nintendo.\n\n\"Honestly, this is fair enough. This is Nintendo's content and what they allow\nand don't allow is up to them. They don't want you playing with that stuff in\nGarry's Mod\u2014that's their decision, we have to respect that and take down as\nmuch as we can.\"\n\nThe \"not a mistake\" line may have been prompted in part by earlier DMCA claims\nagainst Nintendo-related mods that some Garry's Mod players claimed were\nfraudulent. It's not clear whether that was actually the case, but it seems to\ndefinitely not be the case now.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\nNintendo is notoriously protective of its property, and it's not shy about\ngetting heavy with people it thinks are getting out of line. Earlier this\nyear, for instance, it sued the makers of the Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu,\nforcing a near-immediate halt to its development (and sticking the developers\nwith a $2.4 million bill); more famously, it saddled programmer and hacker\nGary Bowser with a $14.5 million financial albatross he'll be paying off for\nthe rest of his life, on top of more than a year spent in a US federal prison,\nfor the crime of making and selling \"circumvention devices\" for the Switch.\n\nIt's the sort of brutal behavior that has a deep, chilling impact, sometimes\nbeyond the obvious targets. In January, for instance, Valve ordered a halt to\nPortal 64, a popular Portal demake for the Nintendo 64. Portal 64 maker James\nLabert said he was asked by Valve to take the project down because it \"depends\non Nintendo's proprietary libraries.\"\n\n\"I think Valve didn't want to be tied up in a project involving Nintendo IP,\"\nLambert told PC Gamer at the time. \"I don't blame them.\"\n\n## PC Gamer Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThat thinking may also be driving the Garry's Mod housecleaning: The potential\nfor headaches (and significant financial pain) is great enough that it's\npreferable to just eliminate any possibility of an unpleasant letter from\nNintendo's legal department.\n\nThere's definitely a lot of Nintendo-related stuff available for Garry's Mod.\nA search for \"Nintendo\" in the Garry's Mod Steam Workshop brings up 44 pages\nof results, while \"Mario\" delivers a whopping 186 pages of results. Other\nNintendo characters, including Bowser, Zelda, Princess Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi\nalso bring up dozens of pages of results. It's a big pile to sort through, and\nFacepunch turned to the community for some help with the effort.\n\n\"This is an ongoing process, as we have 20 years of uploads to go through,\" it\nwrote. \"If you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo related uploads and\nnever uploading them again, that would help us a lot.\"\n\nWhether it will get that help seems to be an open question. Despite the\nmessage, there's still some doubt among Garry's Mod players that the takedown\nrequest is real. Some are criticizing the development team for \"falling for\nit,\" while others are demanding proof that Facepunch verified the takedown\nrequests are legit. A few legal theories about fair use in Japan are being\nkicked around, and there are also calls for Facepunch to keep the Nintendo\ncontent in place as a matter of principle, and damn the consequences.\nNaturally, there's also a good deal of upset with Nintendo, and occasional\npredictions of Garry's Mod's imminent demise (not all of them polite) should\nit knuckle under to the forces of injustice.\n\nNone of which is likely to matter\u2014there's nothing in the takedown announcement\nindicating that this is anything but a done deal. As Facepunch put it, \"It's\nNintendo. Need more be said?\"\n\nI've reached out to Facepunch for comment and will update if I receive a\nreply.\n\nAndy Chalk\n\nAndy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster\nwith text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.\nFrom there he graduated to the glory days of Sierra Online adventures and\nMicroprose sims, ran a local BBS, learned how to build PCs, and developed a\nlongstanding love of RPGs, immersive sims, and shooters.
