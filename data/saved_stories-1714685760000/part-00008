Try RISC OS. It is, literally, something\nelse\n\nLiam Proven\n\nThu 2 May 2024 // 09:51 UTC\n\nThe new version of RISC OS, the original native Arm OS, runs on eight or nine\nArm-based platforms, including the Raspberry Pi Zero, 1, 2, 3 and 4 \u2013 and on\nthat last two, this release supports wireless networking.\n\nRISC OS 5.30 comes with quite an assortment of applications, and plenty more\nare online (click to enlarge)\n\nRISC OS 5.30 is the latest release of Acorn's original native operating system\nfor its Arm processors. Original, but not first: As Acornsoft project lead\nPaul Fellows told the Reg in 2022, what was then called \"Arthur\" supplanted a\nfar more ambitious project called ARX, which never shipped. ROS 5.30 is the\nfirst stable release from the RISC OS Open (aka ROOL) project since version\n5.28 in 2020. (If you have that, you can upgrade in place.)\n\nRISC OS Open project leader Steve Revill, who we interviewed last year, told\nus:\n\nThis stable release has been in the works for a long time \u2013 we wanted to get\nit right! The Wi-Fi support comes from a successful combination of\npartnerships with companies in the RISC OS scene and generous donations from\ncommunity members to support our bounties. We really hope the welcome addition\nof Wi-Fi on the Pi makes it easier for people who've never tried this little\nOS to give it a spin.\n\nAcorn's original, and very comprehensive, documentation has been updated for\nthis release, too:\n\nThere's also a complete User Guide PDF included in our RISC OS Pi download - a\n618 page book, also available in print from ROOL or Amazon. We take pride in\nthe quality of our user documentation and believe this sets us apart from many\nOpen Source projects.\n\nIt also includes a very basic web browser, but one without Javascript \u2013 so\nit's limited (click to enlarge)\n\nNew owners RISC OS Developments made RISC OS 5 open source in 2018 and it's\nstill in active development under RISC OS Open. That is no trivial project:\nAlthough by modern standards this desktop operating system is tiny,\nsignificant chunks of it were hand-coded in Arm assembly code \u2013 for 20th\ncentury hardware. Version 5.30 supports seven platforms: Post-1994 Acorn\nmachines with the IOMD chipset, the Iyonix and Beagleboard hardware we\ndescribed in 2010, and Elesar's Titanium PC, plus three Arm development boards\n(the IGEPv5, the OMAP 5432, and the Pandaboard). And, of course, the Raspberry\nPi, which is by some distance the cheapest member of the family. For now, RISC\nOS does not support the Raspberry Pi 5, but it does run on the Pi Zero, 1, 2,\n3 and 4, and it's fast and responsive on all of them.\n\nWe found the new support for the Wi-Fi controllers in the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4\na little clunky \u2013 for instance, changes to the network configuration require a\nreboot. Even so, it's a lot better than nothing. First, you enable the SDIO\nWLAN interface; then, after a restart, a new Wi-Fi icon appears on the left of\nthe icon bar, which allows you to connect to both 2.4 and 5GHz networks.\n\nThis is a fairly modernized and refurbished late-1980s single-user GUI-based\nOS, and that implies some limitations. It was first released the same year as\nOS/2 1.0, long before Apple System 7 or Windows 3.0. In fact, it'll remind you\nof Windows 3 on MS-DOS: it's a single-tasking text-mode OS, with networking,\non top of which is a graphical desktop that does cooperative multitasking.\nRISC OS gives applications access to much of the memory map, and so if a\nprogram accidentally scribbles over the wrong parts of that address space, the\nwhole computer can freeze up \u2013 which in testing our Pi 400 did several times.\n\nBut saying that, it's an admirably complete OS, in this vulture's opinion,\nwith quite a rich portfolio of applications. RISC OS 5.30 comes with a\nselection of productivity apps, plus development tools, including a choice of\neditors, Python, Lua, and a C compiler \u2013 and of course with a 32-bit version\nof BBC BASIC V, a fully structured interpreter which also supports inline Arm\nassembly language.\n\nThis is, in a way, a mature OS with an ecosystem and an aftermarket. (Which,\nwe feel we must explicitly spell out, means that quite a few of those third-\nparty applications and drivers will cost you money.) There are emulators that\nwill let you run 20th century Acorn apps that you can find online, but this\nisn't an emulated vintage environment like Amiga Forever. It's not meant for\nrunning games from thirty years ago. This is a native bare-metal OS, built on\n1980s roots but updated for 21st century hardware. It's also not an\nexperimental project with little practical use, like Redox OS or Serenity OS,\ninteresting though those are.\n\nThe RISC OS GUI \u2013 called simply the WIMP \u2013 will take some getting used to. It\nhas no application menu bars at all, for example. You middle click on things\nto get at the relevant menu; this GUI only has context menus, nothing else.\n(What menu is easier to hit than whacking the mouse pointer up to the top of\nthe screen? One where you don't move the mouse at all! The menu is always\nwhere your mouse already is.) And yes, there is an icon bar along the bottom\nwhere you can bring up menus and windows for running programs and other\nthings; but when you want to do something in an app, you click the menu mouse\nbutton in the context of that application rather than look for a menu bar.\n\nThe idea of having a directory navigation right in the save dialog, so you can\nchoose where to put the file, was a hack invented for the original 128kB\nMacintosh, because it didn't have enough RAM to show a filer window alongside\nyour app. RISC OS didn't need that: In 1987, it ran on a 32-bit RISC\nworkstation with a meg of RAM, so its Save dialog just has an icon that you\ndrag to the directory window you want.\n\nSimilarly, this is the OS whose GUI perhaps inspired NeXTstep's Dock, which in\nturn inspired the Windows 95 taskbar. RISC OS doesn't work like them, because\nit's often thought they got their ideas from RISC OS.\n\nWhen you run a RISC OS application, all that happens is that it puts an icon\nin the icon bar. Middle-click that new icon for global options, or in most\napps, just left-click it to open a new empty window. The right button doesn't\ngo unused: it's called Adjust and it modifies what a left-click would do. So,\nfor example, left-click a scrollbar to move in that direction, but right-click\nit to move the other direction. Left-click an \"OK\" button to save your\nsettings, but right-click it to Apply them without closing. It's odd, but in\nits way, it's more elegant than any other mouse-driven desktop.\n\nAs you can no doubt tell, the Reg FOSS desk is very fond of RISC OS. It was\nthe first GUI we got to know, on our Archimedes A310 \u2013 back when Apple's\nSystem 6 was new. That ran best on the Mac IIci, which was $6,269 \u2013 in 2024,\nthat's $153\u20444K or \u00a3121\u20442K. When this vulture was 20, our used Archie cost \u00a3800\n(one kilobuck).\n\nRISC OS is a fascinating glimpse into another world. It has almost no\ninfluence from the worlds of 32-bit Windows, or MacOS 7 or Mac OS X, or Linux\n\u2013 because they hadn't been invented yet. It has a superbly elegant graphical\ndesktop, but it's almost totally unlike anything else you've ever seen.\n\nImagine if the classic 1980s Motorola 68000 computers \u2013 the Atari ST, the\nAmigas, or the Classic MacOS pre-PowerPC Macs \u2013 and their CPUs had kept on\ndeveloping and evolving into the present day, completely separately from\nmodern world of 64-bit chips and both FOSS and proprietary OSes. That's what\nRISC OS is: A time-traveler from the 1980s, alive and well, modernized and\nupdated, but almost completely free of any influence from the rest of the\n32-bit World Wide Web era. You will find it very disorienting, especially if\nall you know is post-1990s OSes, but that's part of the fun. Almost everything\nyou could want \u2013 web browsers, email, office-type apps, games, dev tools \u2013\nit's all there, and enough to get you started is here, free and open source.\n\nThe 2024 release of RISC OS runs fine on a \u00a312 ($15) Raspberry Pi Zero \u2013 and\nthe same SD card will boot any model up to the Pi 4 or 400. (But not, for now,\nthe new, 64-bit-only Pi 5.) If you don't have one of those, but have an old Pi\n1, 2 or 3 lying in a drawer somewhere, dusty and neglected, dig it out and put\nRISC OS onto an SD card \u2013 even a 2GB card will do \u2013 and give it a try. \u00ae\n\n### Bootnote\n\nROOL is not the only flavor of RISC OS, and the machines listed above aren't\nthe only modern RISC OS hardware in the world \u2013 they just happen to be the\nones that the RISC OS Open project currently supports. There are some other\ndevices that aren't included in version 5.30 right now, because there are too\nmany outstanding bugs. Some of these have their own separate ports of RISC OS\navailable. This includes the PineBook and PineBook Pro laptops, and the PINE\nA64 board.\n\nIn addition, there are two other noteworthy editions.\n\nThere's a distribution specifically aimed at the Raspberry Pi, called RISC OS\nDirect, also from RISC OS Developments. We talked to Andrew Rawnsley of RISC\nOS Developments, who told us:\n\nOur expectation is to deliver a version of RISC OS Direct with all this baked\nin over the summer, but with such a significant piece of engineering, we are\nmaking sure to test thoroughly.\n\nThis is the culmination of a much larger project to modernise RISC OS - new\nTCP/IP, IPv6, Firewall, Wi-fi, Browser (essential to configure wifi in many\ninstances), and a ready-to-go RISC OS to present it all. Even the UI has seen\na lick of paint thanks to Pinboard2.\n\nThere's also a separately-maintained 26-bit branch of RISC OS for original\nAcorn hardware, although these days most users run it on x86 PCs or Macs on a\ncommercial emulator called Virtual Acorn.\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Raspberry Pi\n  * RISC\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Raspberry Pi\n  * RISC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AVR\n  * RISC-V\n  * SiFive\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Arm\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Raspberry Pi\n  * RISC\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Raspberry Pi\n  * RISC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AVR\n  * RISC-V\n  * SiFive\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Arm\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Raspberry Pi adds more memory to the Compute Module 4S\n\nCompute Module 5 still on track for later this year\n\nPersonal Tech5 days | 8\n\n#### Raspberry Pi OS 5.2 is here, with pleasant tweaks to Wayland-based\ndesktop\n\nKernel 6.6 and small refinements, plus less visible, but meaningful\nadjustments\n\nOSes2 months | 38\n\n#### Venturing beyond the default OS on Raspberry Pi 5\n\nThe pros and cons of some other Arm Linux distros for the pocket powerhouse\n\nOSes2 months | 56\n\n#### Getting on board with AI\n\nHow partnerships can provide the key to getting up and running with AI faster\nthan the competition\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Flipper Zero takes to the big screen\n\nRP2040-based Video Game Module brings game controller functionality and video\noutput\n\nPersonal Tech3 months | 6\n\n#### PiStorm turbocharges vintage Amigas with the Raspberry Pi\n\nFOSDEM 2024 Who needs the present when you can relive the '80s at warp speed?\n\nPersonal Tech3 months | 34\n\n#### Raspberry Pi Pico cracks BitLocker in under a minute\n\nWindows encryption feature defeated by $10 and a YouTube tutorial\n\nResearch3 months | 143\n\n#### Raspberry Pi on IPO plans: 'We want to be ready when the markets are\nready'\n\nBankers appointed, but CEO insists nothing will change while he's in charge\n\nPersonal Tech3 months | 55\n\n#### Techie resurrects teletext on a vintage BBC Master\n\nYou can get Ceefax via a Pi, but behold it in its most exotic of habitats\n\nBootnotes3 months | 20\n\n#### Eben Upton on Sinclair, Acorn, and the Raspberry Pi\n\nInterview The future's bright.
