That's what it's there for!\n\n### If you're rsyncing, and are willing to offer anonymous rsync service,\nplease let me know at the adr below\n\n### As of Apr, 2024 there are over 165000 files including over 8 million text\npages in the archive.\n\n## Bitsavers Updates RSS\n\nRSS feeds for bitsavers updates are available bits communications components\nmagazines pdf test_equipment\n\n## Mastodon\n\nbitsavers' social media presence\n\n## Active Mirrors\n\n### Web\n\nbitsavers.computerhistory.org bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de\nbitsavers.trailing-edge.com University of Kent ftpmirror.your.org\nwww.bighole.nl decromancer.ca\n\n### FTP\n\nbitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de University of Kent ftpmirror.your.org\n\n### RSYNC\n\nftpmirror.your.org ftpmirror.infania.net\n\nrsync is the preferred method for cloning and syncing with the archive. This\nsite has no javascript, data bases or any of that Web 2.0 stuff It was\ndesigned to be cloned as-is to be an exact copy of bitsavers.org\n\nYou can clone the entire archive with\n\nrsync -av --delete rsync://bitsavers.org:/bitsavers/ bitsavers/\n\nAs of Oct, 2023, the entire archive is around 1.4tb\n\nThere was a big bump in archive size because of the preservation of NetBSD iso\narchival releases If you are syncing, be warned that file names, dates and\ntheir location in the hierarchy change (these aren't permalinks) The --delete\nin the rsync is important\n\n## Archive Indexing\n\nAn index file is maintained at the top level of each category heirarchy\nIndexByDate.txt is updated each time an indexed document is added to the\narchive. These files are what drives the rss feeds\n\n## Snapshots/Mirrors\n\n  * Jul 2004 shapshot of pdp-11.trailing-edge.com\n  * Jan 2005 shapshot of simh.trailing-edge.com\n  * Jun 2012 snapshot of simh.trailing-edge.com\n  * scans from the University of Queensland\n  * NetBSD release archive 1.0 to the present\n\n  \n---  \n  \n## The PDF Document Format\n\nDocuments here are kept in a minimal subset of PDF format, just using it as a\ncontainer for lossless Group 4 fax compression (ITU-T recommendation T.6)\nimages. Contributions are normally post-processed by tools to put them in\nexactly this format.\n\nDocuments were scanned using a Ricoh IS520 400dpi 30ppm B&W duplex production\nscanner from the late 90's through 2007.\n\nConversion to higher performance Kodak DS 2500D scanning occured in July,\n2007. The 2500D is an OEM version of the Panasonic KV-S2055 scanner.\n\nIn 2008, the Kodak was replaced by a Panasonic KV-S3065W, which is capable of\nduplex color 600dpi scanning, and has the capability to scan sheets 100 inches\nlong.\n\nPost-processing is done using Lemkesoft's TIFF to PDF conversion is done using\nEric Smith's tumble A final OCR step is done with Acrobat Pro. I've continued\nto use tumble since it is MUCH faster than Acrobat for tif to pdf conversion.\n\nThe preferred form for any contributed text scan is as a collection of\nlossless Group 4 fax compression (ITU-T recommendation T.6) images saved as\nTIFF files with a minium scan resolution of 400 dpi.\n\nLower scan resolutions produce noticable artifacts if a page needs to be\nstraightened in post-processing.\n\nLossy compression formats, such as JPEG, should NEVER be used to save pages of\ntext, since the compression format destroys edge resolution and contrast\n\n## OCR\n\nOCR has been part of the post-processing of scans for many years now and is\nslowly being applied to older pdf files. It is a slow process and it will take\nmany years to complete.\n\n## Document Scanning Station\n\n## Tape processing over the years\n\nThese were taken in rooms that no longer exist at CHM, ca. 2006. The rooms\nwere demolished when the Revolution exhibit was built. They were roughly where\nthe gift shop and orientation theatre are now. You can see four XServe RAIDs\nwhich are still in use in 2021 with 2.5\" 1tb Toshiba SATA drives and PATA/SATA\nadapters.\n\n## Where does the source material come from?\n\nMost of the documents are from my personal collection that I have either\nbought or been given over the course of many decades in the computer industry,\nor have been loaned to me for scanning.\n\nI have a VERY large backlog of material to scan and don't actively solicit\nmaterial to work on.\n\nIf I do decide to scan something from a donor I will return it if requested.\n\nUnless it is a very rare document I probably won't accept something that\nrequires manual scanning, since scanning time in my day is limited.\n\nI do not personally archive any paper that has been scanned.\n\nThe scanning process I use is destructive. Bindings are removed and paper is\nrecycled.\n\nOriginal documents that are still in good condition may be donated to the\nComputer History Museum for archiving, depending on if they are within CHM's\ncollecting scope.\n\nThe CHM running lot number for my donated documents is X6512.2012\n\nThis project was started to downsize my collection of paper in the early 90's\nand continues to be its primary purpose.\n\nand.. the site looks this way for a reason, to leave it static and easy to\nmirror, so don't remind me that it looks like it's from 1995\n\nat bitsavers dot org\n\n", "frontpage": true}
