Credit: Allen J.\nSchaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty\n\nDownload PDF\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is already transforming the global economy.\nCompanies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars each year in these\ntechnologies. In almost every sector, AI is being used to drive operational\nefficiencies, manage complexity, provide personalized services and speed up\ninnovation.\n\nAs AI\u2019s influence on society grows, questions arise about its impact on\ngreenhouse-gas emissions: will its myriad applications help to reduce the\nworld\u2019s carbon footprint or hinder climate progress? The answer will depend on\nhow AI models are developed and operated, and what changes result from their\nuse. And scientists simply don\u2019t know how all that will pan out \u2014 a worrying\nsituation when there is so much at stake.\n\nMost discussions so far about AI\u2019s environmental consequences have focused on\nthe direct impacts of these computationally intensive technologies \u2014 how much\nenergy, water or other resources they consume and the amount of greenhouse\ngases they generate. But the global repercussions of AI applications for\nsociety will be much broader, from transforming health care and education to\nincreasing the efficiency of mining, transportation and agriculture.\n\nSuch AI-driven changes can lead to indirect effects on emissions, which might\nbe positive or negative. These indirect effects also need to be taken into\naccount, and could vastly exceed those from direct impacts^1^,^2. Assessments\nof all types of AI impact are urgently needed. Here\u2019s what we know and what we\ndon\u2019t.\n\n## Uncertainty ahead\n\nThe direct impacts of AI on climate so far are relatively small. AI operations\nfor large models require millions of specialized processors in dedicated data\ncentres with powerful cooling systems. AI processors installed in 2023 consume\n7\u201311 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity annually, which is about 0.04% of\nglobal electricity use^3. That is less than for cryptocurrency mining (100\u2013150\nTWh) and conventional data centres (500\u2013700 TWh), which together accounted for\n2.4\u20133.3% of global electricity demand in 2022, according to the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA). Thus, in terms of total global greenhouse-gas emissions,\nwe calculate that AI today is responsible for about 0.01%, on the basis of IEA\nassessments showing that data centres and transmission networks together\naccount for about 0.6% (see go.nature.com/3q7e6pv).\n\nAI use is expanding rapidly. Over the past decade, the compute capacity used\nto train advanced large language models has increased tenfold each year.\nDemand for AI services is expected to rise by 30\u201340% annually over the next\n5\u201310 years. And more powerful AI models will require more energy. One estimate\nsuggests that, by 2027, global AI-related energy consumption could be 10 times\ngreater than it was in 2023^3, or about as much as is consumed annually by\npeople watching television in US homes. Although there could be challenges for\nlocal electricity grids in regions where many data centres are based, from a\nglobal perspective, AI should not lead directly to large, near-term increases\nin greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nImprovements in energy efficiency could offset some of the projected increase\nin power demand, as they did when data centres expanded in the 2010s^4. More-\nefficient AI algorithms, smaller models and innovations in hardware and\ncooling systems should help^5^,^6. For example, small language models, such as\nMicrosoft\u2019s Phi-2 and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano, can run on mobile phones and\ndeliver capabilities previously seen only with the largest models. AI\ncompanies are increasingly investing in renewable power and setting up\noperations in countries or regions with abundant clean-energy supplies, such\nas Iceland.\n\nIndirect effects are less clear, however. Some AI applications are designed to\ntackle climate change, for example to reduce emissions from the energy and\ntransport sectors, from buildings and industry operations and from land use.\nOptimizing supply chains will make manufacturing more efficient and support\nthe integration of renewable energy into electricity grids. Speeding up the\ndevelopment of new materials for batteries and renewable energy^7^,^8 will be\na boon.\n\nThere could also be some negative indirect impacts. Embedding AI into existing\napplications, from health care to entertainment, might drive more electricity\nuse. Oil and gas exploration and extraction could become cheaper, potentially\ndriving up production. And without proper governance, the widespread use of AI\ncould affect political and economic stability, with ramifications for poverty,\nfood security and social inequalities \u2014 all of which could have knock-on\neffects for emissions^9.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just existing AI systems. How will future AI technologies develop?\nHow will their expansion affect the global economy? And how will this affect\ndecarbonization? Researchers simply don\u2019t know; it\u2019s too early to tell. It is\ntempting to simply extrapolate past AI electricity-use trends into the future,\nbut overlooking social, economic and technological factors often results in\nlarge forecasting errors^4^,^5^,^10. Similarly, an overly simplistic view of\nthe impacts of indirect emissions risks underestimating AI\u2019s potential for\naccelerating important climate-solution breakthroughs, such as the development\nof less expensive and more powerful batteries in months rather than\ndecades^11.\n\n## AI-driven emissions scenarios\n\nRecognizing these huge uncertainties, here we call on researchers to develop a\nset of policy-relevant scenarios to quantify the effects that AI expansion\ncould have on the climate under a range of assumptions. Routinely used by\nfinancial institutions to understand risks and opportunities and plan\ninvestments, scenarios combine quantitative models with expert consultations.\nRather than making predictions, they explore many possible futures based on\ninfluential factors.\n\nSpecifically, we recommend that a suite of scenarios be built to better\nunderstand how AI expansion might affect emissions, both directly and\nindirectly. These scenarios should range from a \u2018reference\u2019 case without\nwidespread adoption of powerful AI technologies, to an \u2018aspirational\u2019 case in\nwhich all the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are achieved;\nscenarios should also include ones with undesirable outcomes.\n\nFive elements are essential for AI-driven emissions scenarios to be credible\nand useful.\n\nLink to existing climate scenarios. The climate community already uses\nintegrated assessment models (IAMs) to assess future greenhouse-gas emissions\nquantitatively on the basis of qualitative narratives about potential socio-\neconomic, demographic, policy, technology and governance outcomes. Five\nstandard scenarios, or Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), are widely used.\nThese range from a future in which the world is deeply divided and remains\nhooked on fossil fuels to a more optimistic scenario of global cooperation,\ndecoupling of economic growth from emissions and serious investment in clean\nenergy.\n\nAI should be integrated into these pathways, along with the global shocks and\ntechnological breakthroughs that might accompany it. This would require major\nwork, including incorporating expertise from the AI community, rethinking each\nof the pathway narratives and exploring whether new ones need to be added.\nCould AI take the world to a more radically green future, or a more dystopian\none? What factors define those outcomes? How plausible are they? Scenarios can\nhelp to narrow down answers.\n\nTurning these narratives into quantitative scenarios will require developing\nnew analytical models, collecting new types of data and establishing an\ninstitutional structure to enable rapid updates to keep up with the fast pace\nof societal transformations that AI is driving, as we outline here.\n\nDevelop quantitative analytical frameworks. Developing IAMs for exploring the\ninfluence of AI will require improved data and analytical frameworks for both\ndirect and indirect impacts. The biggest challenge will be quantifying the\nrange of indirect effects resulting from AI-driven societal transformations,\nas well as AI-powered innovations on climate-relevant advances and\nbreakthroughs.\n\nFor example, AI personalization could encourage sustainable consumption, but\nit could also increase demand for resource-intensive goods. And disentangling\nthe emissions impacts of AI-enabled innovations from other technologies that\nlower emissions, such as renewables or carbon capture, will be challenging\nbecause the pace of research and development differs across sectors. Policies\nand regulations are also often slow to catch up. Quantifying the interplay of\nthese dynamics will be difficult.\n\nComparing and replicating scenarios will be key to improving them as AI\nsystems are rolled out. Researchers should regularly run comparisons between\ndifferent models for direct and indirect AI-related emissions, coordinated\nthrough platforms used by the climate community, such as the Energy Modeling\nForum and the Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium. Scientists must\nensure that the data and assumptions in these analyses are fully documented,\nfreely shared and completely replicable by others.\n\nShare data. Data availability is a challenge \u2014 especially for fast-moving\nindustries such as AI, in which data are often private or tied to proprietary\ninformation. For example, more data are needed on AI workloads in large cloud-\ncomputing companies, their electricity and carbon intensity, and trends in\nefficiencies gained for building and using AI models.\n\nMethods to safely and openly share representative, measured, aggregated and\nanonymized data without compromising sensitive information are needed. AI can\nbuild on examples from other industries \u2014 such as the Getting the Numbers\nRight initiative, which keeps track of carbon dioxide and energy performance\nindicators in the global cement industry, and the Solomon Energy Intensity\nIndex for fuel refining and pipelines.\n\nStandards should be established for measuring, reporting, verifying and\ndisseminating AI-related data, to ensure both quality and broad accessibility.\nRecent legislation, such as the European Union\u2019s AI Act and the European\nEnergy Efficiency Directive, could help to drive the development of standards.\nAlthough neither regulation directly mandates specific reporting on AI energy\nconsumption, their emphasis on data-centre transparency and efficiency could\npromote the development of reporting standards.\n\nIssue rapid updates. AI technology is advancing so quickly that scenarios will\nneed to be revised at least once per year, and ideally twice. This is more\nfrequent than is currently done for climate-change scenarios, which are\nupdated every 6\u20137 years. Annual or biannual updates will be challenging, given\nthe need to collect new data and to develop analytical frameworks as AI\nsystems, applications and breakthroughs emerge.\n\nBecause of the potential for AI to either reduce or increase energy demand,\nresearchers must update models that represent societal demand for energy, as\nwell as explore how this demand will change as AI technologies evolve.\nScenarios with varying resolutions might be released on different time frames.\nFor example, coarse-resolution scenarios might be updated every few months;\nmore-detailed scenarios could be released every 2\u20133 years.\n\nBuild an international consortium. An international consortium needs to be set\nup to undertake the development of AI-driven emissions scenarios. It should\ngather specialists from around the world and represent all the relevant\ndisciplines \u2014 from computer and sustainability science to sociology and\neconomics. We suggest this AI-driven emissions-scenario community be co-\nsponsored by international scientific networks that focus on sustainability,\nsuch as the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in\nLaxenburg, Austria, and by international non-governmental organizations\nfocused on AI and society. Examples include the Partnership on AI or the newly\nestablished UN Futures Lab, which has been set up to coordinate and improve\nstrategic foresight across the UN to guide long-term decision making.\n\nConsortia that are associated with key IAM and energy-systems models, such as\nthe IEA Technology Collaboration Programme or the IIASA\u2019s programmes, could\nensure both open access to data and models, and immediate relevance to the\nbroader climate-scenario modelling communities. The UN and other bodies, such\nas the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva, Switzerland, should be\nengaged \u2014 but without compromising on the need for agility and speed.\n\nFinancial support will be needed to maintain the consortium and support the\nregular update of scenarios. This could come from a combination of\nphilanthropic, private, governmental and intergovernmental sources.\n\nAI is one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. It\u2019s imperative\nthat decisions around its development and use \u2014 today and as it evolves \u2014 are\nmade with sustainability in mind. Only through developing a set of standard\nAI-driven emissions scenarios will policymakers, investors, advocates, private\ncompanies and the scientific community have the tools to make sound decisions\nregarding AI and the global race to net-zero emissions.\n\nNature 628, 718-720 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01137-x\n\n## References\n\n  1.
