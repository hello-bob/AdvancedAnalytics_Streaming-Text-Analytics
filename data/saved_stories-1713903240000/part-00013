But the future of these controversial businesses is\nnow under threat, after a Chinese court ruled that they are illegal on\nmultiple grounds.\n\nMaid caf\u00e9s \u2014 venues where male customers are served by female staff, usually\ndressed in skimpy outfits \u2014 first became popular in China in the late 2010s.\nThough they are no longer as fashionable as they were then, there are still\nthousands of them operating all over the country.\n\nThe original case against maid caf\u00e9s was brought by a local procuratorate in\nthe eastern city of Yiwu, which launched a large-scale investigation in the\nwake of a sexual assault case in a local venue in 2023.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSubmit\n\nBy submitting, you agree to our Terms Of Use.\n\n*Please enter an email address.\n\nLocal officials found that hundreds of caf\u00e9s and e-sports venues in Yiwu were\noffering maid caf\u00e9-style services, with female servers forced to kneel to\nserve tea, massage male customers, and shout \u201cWelcome home, my master!\u201d to\nanyone entering.\n\nThe procuratorate brought a public interest lawsuit to a local court, arguing\nthat such services \u201cbelittle and damage women\u2019s rights to human dignity.\u201d They\nalso said that some local businesses had failed to take measures to protect\ntheir female staff from sexual harassment.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of the procuratorate in late 2023, and local\nbusinesses were ordered to cease offering maid services or face closure. Over\nthe following months, Yiwu authorities reportedly investigated over 800\nbusinesses to ensure they had complied.\n\nNow, this case looks set to become a model for other Chinese cities to follow.\nEarlier this week, China\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate published a list of\n12 cases for prosecutors nationwide to learn from, which included the maid\ncaf\u00e9 ruling in Yiwu.\n\nThe list \u2014 which the procuratorate released jointly with the All-China Women\u2019s\nFederation and All-China Federation of Trade Unions \u2014 covers a wide range of\nissues, including the handling of sexual harassment and assault cases,\ndiffering standards for male and female toilets, and the denial of land rights\nto women in rural China.\n\nMaid caf\u00e9s have been controversial in China ever since the industry first\nstarted to take off, with detractors arguing that they degrade women and in\nsome cases become hotbeds of sexual harassment. But they still have many fans;\ncontent related to maid caf\u00e9s regularly attracts massive traffic on Douyin,\nChina\u2019s version of TikTok, and the video platform Bilibili.\n\nChen Qianyi, a gender equality advocate from the southern Hainan province,\ntold Sixth Tone that she had been \u201cwaiting for maid caf\u00e9s to face this\nspecific restriction since 2018.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaid caf\u00e9s have been a symbolic space where women are defaulted to being the\nsubject of sexual exploitation,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThe key to solving this problem\nshould be educating the public to respect women.\u201d\n\nIn a comment on the Yiwu case, the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate said that it\nshould serve as a model for other cities because local prosecutors took swift\naction despite facing a difficult situation: Maid caf\u00e9s are a new industry\nsubject to little specific regulation and control, meaning that rights\ninfringements were often passing unnoticed.\n\nChina\u2019s revised women\u2019s rights protection law, which came into effect in 2023,\nhas given prosecutors new powers by clarifying that violating women\u2019s right to\npersonal dignity is also illegal. In the past year, more than 46,000 people\nhave been prosecuted in China for violating women\u2019s rights to life, health,\nand personal dignity, a year-over-year increase of 10.7%, according to\nofficial data.\n\n(Header image: IC)\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nABOUT SIXTH TONE\n\n  * About Us\n\n|\n\n  * Contribute\n\n|\n\n  * Join Us\n\n|\n\n  * Research\n\n|\n\n  * Contact Us\n\n|\n\n  * Terms Of Use\n\n|\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n|\n\n  * Sitemap\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Terms Of Use.\n\n\u6caaICP\u590714003370\u53f7-4\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016~2024 Sixth Tone.
