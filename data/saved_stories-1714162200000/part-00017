If you\u2019ve had the misfortune of\nlistening to my \u201cI went to Calgary and got to visit 3 BIG MINERAL STORES and\nalso SCRABBLE IN THE DIRT FOR FOSSILS\u201d speech, then you might be wondering\nwhat\u2019s wrong with this adult man.\n\nOne of the themes and joys of this mineral collection is the Permadance.\n\nThe \u201cPermadance\u201d happens when something temporary becomes permanent. Soft\nbecomes hard. Something cold and sturdy becomes warm and wobbly. Dissolving.\nRe-forming. Hardening. Transforming.\n\nThis constant transformation \u2013 this ongoing dance \u2013 makes me feel awe and\nwonder. And a mineral collection is a way to tap into that feeling.\n\nThe Permadance is a sea snail turning into metal\n\nSource\n\nA hunk of cinnabar sweating out its deadly contents\n\nSource\n\nIt is a Neanderthal inside your bathroom tile\n\nSource\n\nThe PermaDance is 4 square-miles of ancient rainforest inside a coal mine.\n\nSource\n\nI think about these miners \u2013 down there with headlamps, in the heat and damp\nof the mine. Backs wet with sweat. Flimsy fabric sticking to the skin. Booming\ndown the mine tunnels in their squat jeep, rushing to where digging machine\nmeets coal-face. No time to think about the roof two feet above. No time to\nthink about roots and leaves and acorns and giant tree fern trunks protruding\nthrough the walls. We have work to do. Busy busy busy.\n\nBodies surrounded. Enshrouded. Enveloped by a rainforest.\n\nOne day, a great granddaughter of mine will think about me. Sitting at my\nsecond-hand Aeron chair. Shirt sticking to my clammy back. Eyes unwavering.\nFocused on the screen two feet in front. Too busy busy busy thinking about\nFail to retrieve sObject 00QMm000007ASqDMAW, this sObject could have been\ndeleted or a permission setting is preventing sync user to read this record to\nnotice the transformation taking place around me.
