Under\nPayUp, delivery drivers made $26 per hour before accounting for mileage and\ntips.\n\nUnder the new proposal, gig workers were provided a minimum wage of $19.97,\nwhich is Seattle's minimum wage, plus a per-mile minimum payment of $0.35.\nHowever, this rule has many worried gig workers would go without a living\nwage.\n\nGroup of delivery people waiting on e-bikes outside McDonalds fast food\nrestaurant, Queens, New York. Seattle is considering a new bill that would\nbring down the minimum wage for delivery drivers after reduced consumer\ndemand.

But it was also said to protect\ndelivery drivers, who are forced to spend their own money on extra costs like\ngas and vehicle maintenance.\n\n\"Under these revisions, drivers would still be paid at a guaranteed hourly\nrate, although some advocates say when you factor any other expenses these gig\nworkers face, it would ultimately present a negative effect to their overall\npay,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of\nTennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\n\nExclusively Available to Subscribers Try it now for $1\n\nDoorDash said the company experienced 300,000 fewer orders within Seattle in\nthe past three months, likely related to the city's minimum wage guidelines\nand how they impacted consumer prices.\n\nRead more\n\n  * Minimum wage study debunks business claim\n  * Minimum wage could be raised for thousands of Americans\n  * California unemployment spikes\n\n\"It's painfully clear from listening to Dashers, merchants and consumers that\nthis new law simply isn't working,\" DoorDash said in a statement, as reported\nby Fox 13. \"The latest numbers show that the longer this law remains in place,\nthe more harm it causes. The compromise proposal presented by Drive Forward\nthat the City Council is considering is a promising step toward increasing\naffordability for consumers and restoring millions in lost revenue for\nmerchants and Dashers in Seattle.\"\n\nUber also said delivery orders had shifted down by 30 percent in the weeks\nfollowing the law's passage.\n\n\"Protecting gig workers is important,\" finance expert Michael Ryan, the\nfounder of michaelryanmoney.com, told Newsweek. \"But the real-world impacts\nhave been pretty brutal for all sides so far. That's why the city council is\nnow considering scaling back some of the wage requirements.\"\n\nThe new law could be voted on by May 21, and restaurants, employees and\ncustomers alike are waiting to see how it will impact them financially. The\nlaw could also face amendments before being passed.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Seattle City Council for comment via email.\n\nBeene said Seattle and other major cities are struggling to figure out how to\npass minimum wages that fit the financial needs of employees while not harming\nthe local economy.\n\n\"There seems to be a universal agreement that these workers deserve better\nwages than what they were receiving, but it's difficult to know exactly how\nmuch employers can give while also turning a profit,\" Beene said. \"The\nadvocates calling for more transparency from employers in this space are spot-\non. We need a breakdown of where all these charges to the customer are going\nin order to know how much truth there is to the claim they can't pay over a\ncertain amount.\"\n\n## Uncommon Knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial Guidelines\n\n### About the writer\n\nSuzanne Blake\n\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.
