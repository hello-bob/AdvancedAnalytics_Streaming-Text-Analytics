This README will guide\nyou through the enchanting process of setting up and running cloud functions\nlocally, ensuring a pristine, isolated development environment with the aid of\nGitpod. \ud83e\uddd9\u2642\ufe0f\u2728\n\n## Premise \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n\nFor this magical journey, Python will serve as our trusty runtime language. To\navoid any mystical contamination in our local environment, I've set everything\nup in a dedicated Gitpod workspace. It's like conjuring your very own wizard's\ntower for code experimentation! \ud83c\udff0\n\nBypass the implementation steps by leaping straight into this repository in\nGitpod! Click the button below to teleport there (it's pre-configured for\nconvenience \ud83d\ude09):\n\n## Implementation \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n\nFirst, let's enchant our requirements.txt file with a sprinkle of\ndependencies:\n\n    \n    \n    functions-framework==3.*\n\nNow for the spell-casting\u2014the code! Here's a simple Python script that summons\na cloud function:\n\n    \n    \n    import functions_framework @functions_framework.http def main(request): return f'Hello, {request.json.get(\"name\")}\\n' if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()\n\n### Spell Details \ud83e\uddd0\n\n  * @functions_framework.http: This powerful spell instructs our script to gear up for responding to HTTP requests as a Cloud Function.\n  * It's crucial to always send a response back. Ignoring requests is a no-no in both the arcane and coding worlds\u2014it prevents errors and keeps the magical and digital flows balanced.\n\n## Execution \ud83d\ude80\n\nIt's time to animate our cloud function! Open your terminal (ensure it's not\nengaged with other magical commands) and recite the following spell:\n\n    \n    \n    functions-framework --target=main\n\nOpen another terminal window (think of it as opening a portal to another\ndimension) and invoke your newly minted function:\n\n    \n    \n    curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"name\":\"Siddhant\"}' http://localhost:8080\n\nIf the cosmic energies align and your incantation is precise, you will be\ngreeted with:\n\n    \n    \n    Hello, Siddhant\n\n## Epilogue \ud83c\udf1f\n\nRemember, the functions-framework is capable of more than just HTTP functions;\nit can also initiate event-driven functions. Perhaps that's an adventure we'll\nembark upon in the future!\n\n## References \ud83d\udcda\n\nFor more spells and scholarly knowledge, consult these ancient tomes (or just\nclick here):\n\n  * Google Cloud Functions Framework Python\n\nHappy coding, and best wishes on your serverless quest! <3\n\n## About\n\nRun Cloud Functions Locally or in Gitpod\n\n### Topics\n\nserverless local cloud-functions gitpod\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n0 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
