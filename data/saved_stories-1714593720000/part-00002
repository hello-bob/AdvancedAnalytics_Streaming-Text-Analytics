Thanks to MainFT\u2019s Eric\nPlatt, Alphaville has now got its mitts on the prospectus for its latest bond\nsale.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating stuff and sheds some light on one of Wall Street\u2019s hottest\nplayers. We won\u2019t upload the whole thing though: we checked it for watermarks\nand scrubbed its metadata, but Jane Street is paranoid and publicity-shy\nenough that they might have inserted a few subtle changes in different docs to\nsee if anyone leaks it.\n\nBut here are FTAV\u2019s main observations from the prospectus.\n\n## Jane Street\u2019s footprint is huge, and growing\n\nJane Street estimates that, thanks to its strong growth in equities\nwholesaling, it accounted for 10.4 per cent of all North American equity\ntrading in 2023, up from 7.6 per cent in 2022. In other words, it is catching\nup on Citadel Securities, which reckons that it accounts for 23 per cent of US\nequity market volume.\n\nGlobally, Jane Street thinks that it now accounts for over 2 per cent of all\ntrading in over 20 countries, and last year Jane Street also traded options\nwith a notional value of $32tn, about 7.6 per cent of all volume in Options\nClearing Corporation contracts.\n\nHowever, the firm\u2019s prowess is particularly strong in ETF market-making. Last\nyear Jane Street\u2019s monthly ETF trading volumes averaged $527bn, or about 14\nper cent of US ETF trading volumes and 20 per cent of European ETF volumes.\nAcross the year that clocks in at $6.3tn.\n\nFor context, that\u2019s about five times the London Stock Exchange\u2019s entire\ntrading volumes in 2023.\n\nIt is even more important as an \u201cauthorised participant\u201d \u2014 specialised market-\nmakers that enable the creation and redemption of ETF shares \u2014 accounting for\n24 per cent of all primary market activity in US-listed ETFs, 28 per cent in\ninternational equity ETFs and 12 per cent in US equity ETFs.\n\nJane Street is particularly dominant in fixed income ETFs , accounting for 41\nper cent of all primary market activity according to its bond prospectus. The\ntrading firm has used this as a bridgehead to break into corporate bond\ntrading territory long dominated by banks. The prospectus says:\n\n> We are a leader in fixed income and corporate bond trading, and we saw\n> considerable growth in this business over the last few years. Much of our\n> bond expertise comes from our position as one of the largest fixed income\n> ETF market makers: our primary market activity in fixed income ETFs has\n> helped us expand our bond inventory, which in turn allows us to provide\n> meaningful liquidity in the underlying market. In 2023, we executed\n> approximately $179,000 million globally in portfolio trading volumes with\n> typical basket sizes of $10 million to $1,000 million and 10 to 1,000 line\n> items. We have leveraged our expertise through partnerships with electronic\n> platforms like TradeWeb, Bloomberg, and MarketAxess to develop and refine\n> their portfolio trading offerings. Industry tailwinds, including continued\n> electronification of bonds trading, supports our business. The percentage of\n> bonds traded electronically has grown to 42% and 31% in 2023 in U.S.\n> investment grade and high-yield, respectively, up from 34% and 25% in 2021.\n\nThis is why some people argue that APs like Jane Street have become\nsystemically important.\n\n## Jane Street is stupidly profitable\n\nMainFT already reported the headline numbers \u2014 net trading revenues of $4.4bn\nin the first quarter, after a $10.5bn haul in 2023, and a profit margin north\nof 70 per cent \u2014 but it bears repeating.\n\nThat is the fourth straight year of net trading revenues exceeding $10bn.\nGross revenues came at a record $21.9bn in 2023, up 34 per cent from 2022.\nThat\u2019s equivalent to 1/7th of the combined equity, bond, currency and\ncommodity trading revenues of all the major global investment banks last year.\n\n\u00a9 Coalition\n\nGoldman Sachs \u2014 historically Wall Street\u2019s most formidable trading house \u2014\ngenerated $15.8bn of net revenues from making markets in 2023, but on a vastly\nlarger balance sheet and with a far bigger work force.\n\nAt the end of 2023. Jane Street employed 2,631 people, so that equates to\nalmost $4mn of net revenue per head on average. In adjusted EBITDA, it comes\nto $2.83mn per employee (or nearly $22mn for each of the 482 traders actual\ntraders at Jane Street.) FT Alphaville doesn\u2019t have the number of employees in\nGoldman\u2019s global markets division at hand, but for the bank as a whole the\naverage earnings per head clocked in at $213,000 last year.\n\nAnd the now-legendary Indian options trade that half of Wall Street is trying\nto unearth can\u2019t account for much of this. Asia only accounted for 14 per cent\nof Jane Street\u2019s net revenues last year, up from 12 per cent in 2022:\n\nRevenues by asset class is less lopsided, with bonds, commodities and options\naccounting for 45 per cent of revenues last year, and equities and the rest\nmaking up 55 per cent. That compares to 57 per cent and 43 per cent\nrespectively in 2022, presumably because of the growth of equity wholesaling.\n\n## Jane Street\u2019s balance sheet has grown enormously\n\nThe bond prospectus indicates that Jane Street\u2019s total assets rose 34 per cent\nto $140.2bn at the end of 2024, which is probably one of the best ways to show\njust how different it is from more \u201cpure\u201d high-frequency trading firms that\ntry to avoid warehousing any risk for too long.\n\nFor example, that\u2019s nearly 14 times larger than Virtu. Jane Street is a very\nquant-y firm, where speed and technology are important, but it\u2019s more human-\ndriven than many of the firms it is often compared to, such as Citadel\nSecurities.\n\nAbout 80 per cent of the company\u2019s capital comes from employee equity, which\nhas swelled to $21.3bn at the end of 2023 thanks to retained profits over the\npast four years.\n\nIn recent years, this has been supplemented with some longer-term loans (such\nas the recent bond sale where this data came from). Here\u2019s a more granular\nbreakdown of Jane Street\u2019s capital:\n\nEven this is now a little out of date. The bond prospectus indicates that the\nblowout first quarter of earnings means that there\u2019s now over $24bn of\nmember\u2019s equity.\n\n## Jane Streeters make a lot of money. A LOT\n\nGiven Jane Street\u2019s disclosed compensation and benefits of $2.4bn last year,\nthis works out to over $900k for each employee on average. No wonder even its\ninternships have become so wildly competitive.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this has led to turnover of just 6 per cent over the past two\nyears. Jane Street attributes this to a culture that is \u201chighly collaborative,\nwith an emphasis on intellectual curiosity, minimal hierarchy, and building\nfor the long term\u201d and \u201cthe success of our approach to recruiting and\nretaining talent\u201d. But FTAV suspects it maaaay be linked to some of Wall\nStreet\u2019s most generous paychecks.\n\nThe real money is at the top. The bond prospectus reveals that Jane Street has\n40 \u201cequity unit holders on a full-time basis and in good standing\u201d, with an\naverage tenure of 16 years. Among those there will be at least a handful of\nbillionaires, even if no Jane Streeter appears on any rich lists.\n\nThe only founder still at the firm is Rob Granieri, but insiders say it is\nfunctionally run by roughly 30-40 senior executives in what kinda resembles an\nincredibly profitable anarchist commune. Or as Jane Street itself puts it:\n\n> We operate as a functionally-organized structure consisting of various\n> management and risk committees. Each committee is responsible for directing\n> the overall strategy of the firm and for emphasizing the importance of risk\n> management to our operations. Each of our trading desks and business units\n> is run by equity unit holders who take an active role in managing our day-\n> to-day operations of the firm and have a vested interest in prudent risk\n> management to ensure our long-term success. Our management structure allows\n> for effective cross-departmental communication reflecting our shared sense\n> of responsibility and decision making across a wide array of individuals.\n\n## Jane Street is paranoid\n\nGranieri once told MainFT: \u201cI still walk in every day thinking that we\u2019re\nstill struggling to survive\u201d. Sam Bankman-Fried may be the exception that\nproves the rule \u2014 that wariness still seems to permeate the firm.\n\nIn addition to a heavily-scrutinised centralised risk book monitored by 14\npeople, Jane Street is a big user of options \u201cto hedge firmwide tail risk and\nto manage risk from idiosyncratic exposures\u201d across its various trading desks\nand the company as a whole. The focus is very much on dodging calamities:\n\n> We focus on preparing for firmwide risks during catastrophic events. This\n> involves, among other things, buying out-of-the-money puts as protection.\n> Our goal is not just to protect positions during large dislocations, but to\n> also ensure that we have the liquidity and risk capacity to trade larger\n> than normal, enabling us to provide liquidity to our clients and the market\n> at large.\n\nA few years ago Jane Street indicated that it spends about $50mn-75mn a year\non out-of-the-money puts to insure itself against severe market drops. The\nincome statement in the bond prospectus doesn\u2019t indicate where this might crop\nup, but Jane Street says that \u201cother expenses\u201d came to $359.3mn last year,\nwhich might be where this is lumped under.\n\nThe firm also maintains an extra \u201cliquidity buffer\u201d of about 15 per cent of\nits trading capital, held outside of the prime brokerages through which it\ndoes most of its business and secures its daily leverage.\n\nThis liquidity buffer is meant to ensure that it can hold on to positions even\nat times of extreme market stress and margin calls. It averaged $4.1bn in\n2023, and was held in cash, money market funds, Treasury bills and reverse\nrepo at a holding company level.\n\nUnlike many trading firms, Jane Street also makes a point out of paying its\npeople according to their contribution to the broader company, rather than\ntying it to personal P&L or the earnings of their desk. \u201cAs a result there is\na significant emphasis on contributions to risk management and non-trading\nfunctions\u201d, it argues. It also seems to lead to fewer slaps from the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority.\n\nJane Street even includes its risk management as a risk factor, arguing that\nits extra layers of safety \u2014 a series of preset risk controls on messages\nleaving its trading desks \u2014 can mean it might lose out on business.\n\n> In certain cases, this layer of risk management, which adds latency to our\n> process, may limit our ability to profit from acute volatility in the\n> markets. This would be the case, for example, where a particular strategy\n> being utilized by one of our traders is temporarily halted for violating a\n> preset risk limit. Even if we are able to quickly and correctly resume the\n> trading strategy, we may limit our potential upside as a result of our risk\n> management policies. As a result, our risk management systems could have a\n> material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations,\n> financial condition and/or cash flows.\n\n## Jane Street wants to grow almost everywhere\n\nThe OCaml jockeys at Jane Street insist that the trading firm doesn\u2019t do big\nlong-term strategy plans, merely iterating and evolving year after year. And\nit certainly doesn\u2019t like discussing any plans publicly.\n\nBut it did reveal some vague future initiatives in its bond prospectus,\nprimarily speeding up across the board, growing the equity wholesaling\nbusiness and moving into options wholesaling, and expanding even more in fixed\nincome trading:\n\nAt this stage, few would probably bet against them doing well with all of this\nstuff. But, of course, Wall Street is littered with the carcasses of companies\nthat once looked imperious and unassailable in their fief.\n\nWe gather the likes of Goldman Sachs are particularly keen to take Jane Street\ndown a peg, so it will be interesting to see how things shake out over the\nnext few years.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.
