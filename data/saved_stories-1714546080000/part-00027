for Novo\nNordisk's Ozempic\n\nPublished Tue, Apr 30 20241:48 PM EDTUpdated An Hour Ago\n\nAnnika Kim Constantino@annikakimc\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * The Federal Trade Commission said it is challenging hundreds of alleged \"junk\" patents held by pharmaceutical companies for 20 brand-name drugs, including Novo Nordisk's blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Saxenda.\n  * The FTC has argued that drugmakers are needlessly listing dozens of extra patents for branded medications to keep their drug prices high and stall generic competitors from entering the U.S. market.\n  * The agency sent letters to Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Covis Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Teva Pharmaceuticals, among other pharmaceutical companies.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * NOVO.B-DK\n\nA box of Ozempic and contents sit on a table in Dudley, North Tyneside,\nBritain, October 31, 2023.\n\nLee Smith | Reuters\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said it is challenging hundreds of\nalleged \"junk\" patents held by pharmaceutical companies for 20 brand-name\ndrugs, including Novo Nordisk's blockbuster drugs Ozempic, Saxenda and\nVictoza.\n\nThe FTC issued letters to 10 companies, warning them that certain drug patents\nwere improperly listed. These companies include Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca,\nBoehringer Ingelheim, Covis Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Teva\nPharmaceuticals and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, as well as some of their\nsubsidiaries.\n\nMany of the drug patents are for Type 2 diabetes, along with asthma and\ninhalers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.\n\nMost top-selling medications are protected by dozens of patents covering\nvarious ingredients, manufacturing processes, and intellectual property.\nGeneric drugmakers can only launch cheaper versions of a branded drug if the\npatents have expired or are successfully challenged in court.\n\n\"By filing bogus patent listings, pharma companies block competition and\ninflate the cost of prescription drugs, forcing Americans to pay sky-high\nprices for medicines they rely on,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a release. \"By\nchallenging junk patent filings, the FTC is fighting these illegal tactics and\nmaking sure that Americans can get timely access to innovative and affordable\nversions of the medicines they need.\"\n\nThe FTC also notified the Food and Drug Administration about the challenges.\nThe FDA manages patent listings for approved drugs on a document called the\nOrange Book.\n\nThe FTC first challenged dozens of branded drug patents last fall, leading\nthree drugmakers to comply and delist their patents with the FDA. Five other\ncompanies did not.\n\nThe Tuesday announcement expands the Biden administration's effort to crack\ndown on alleged patent abuses by the pharmaceutical industry. The FTC has\nargued that drugmakers are needlessly listing dozens of extra patents for\nbranded medications to keep their drug prices high and stall generic\ncompetitors from entering the U.S. market.\n\nThe patent disputes add to a broader effort by the Biden administration to\nmake health care more affordable for Americans \u2013 a key pillar of President Joe\nBiden's 2024 reelection campaign.\n\n\"We applaud the FTC's work with FDA to crack down on Big Pharma's patent games\nand lower costs for prescription drugs\u2014including weight loss and diabetes\ndrugs,\" Jon Donenberg, National Economic Council deputy director, said in a\nstatement to CNBC.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Tuesday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, Live Nation, Boeing, Coinbase, Amazon & more\n  * Dividend stocks are poised to outperform, says Bank of America.
