The study is also the first to combine\nthe use of two investigative techniques called electrophysiology and\noptogenetics to study this illusion. Results from experiments on mice settle a\nlong-standing debate in neuroscience about which levels of neurons within the\nbrain are responsible for the perception of brightness.\n\n#### Everyday Optical Illusions\n\nWe\u2019re all familiar with optical illusions; some are novelties, while some are\nall around us. Even as you look at the screen in front you, you are being\nfooled into thinking that you\u2019re seeing the color white. What you\u2019re really\nseeing is lots of red, green, and blue elements packed so tightly together it\ngives the impression of being white. Another example is a fast rotating wheel\nor propeller, which can briefly look like it\u2019s reversing direction while it\u2019s\naccelerating to full speed.\n\nIn any case, it might be surprising to know that optical illusions are not\njust fun to look at but can also be a useful tool to learn more about eyes,\nnerves, minds, and brains.\n\nWhat do you see? This is a classic neon-color-spreading illusion and is not\nthe same as the one used in these experiments. Chances are you can glance at\nthis and initially see a light-blue circle in slight contrast to the otherwise\nwhite background. But in reality, the background is entirely white; it\u2019s as if\nthe blue from the blue sections of the black filaments bleeds into the circle\nimplied by the ends of the blue lines.

It\u2019s a vast subject area so naturally there are\nmany ways to explore it, and amongst other things, he uses optical illusions.\nHis most recent research looked at whether a certain kind of illusion that\nworks on humans would also work on mice. And it turns out, it does. But why is\nthis significant?\n\n\u201cKnowing this kind of illusion, called a neon-color-spreading illusion, works\non mice as well as humans, is useful for neuroscientists like myself, as it\nmeans that mice can serve as useful test subjects for cases where humans\ncannot,\u201d said Watanabe. \u201cTo really understand what goes on inside the brain\nduring perceptual experiences, we need to use certain methods that we cannot\nuse on people. These include electrophysiology, the recording of neural\nactivity with electrodes, and optogenetics, where light pulses enable or\ndisable firing of specific neurons in a living brain.\u201d\n\nWatanabe\u2019s experiment was the first of its kind to make use of both\nelectrophysiology and optogenetics at the same time in animal test subjects\nexposed to the neon-color-spreading illusion, which allowed his team to see\nprecisely what structures within the brain are responsible for processing the\nillusion.\n\n\u201cAfter a visual stimulus lands on the eye, it\u2019s carried to the brain by nerves\nand is then received by a series of layers of neurons called V1, V2, and so\non, where V1 is the first and most basic layer, and V2 and above are\nconsidered higher layers,\u201d said Watanabe.\n\n\u201cThere is a long-standing debate in neuroscience about the role higher levels\nplay in the perception of brightness and it was not an easy thing to study.\nOur experiment on mice has shown us that neurons in V1 responded not just to\nthe illusion, but also to a nonillusory version of the same kind of pattern\nshown. But only when the illusory version was shown to the mice did neurons in\nV2 also play a crucial role: that of modulating the activity of neurons in V1,\nthus proving that V2 neurons do in fact play a role in the perception of\nbrightness.\u201d\n\nThis experiment has shown that mice models can be effective in this area of\nneuroscience. Watanabe hopes this is just the beginning and that such\nexperiments will help toward his grand aim of clarifying the neural mechanism\nof consciousness.\n\nReference: \u201cBrightness illusions drive a neuronal response in the primary\nvisual cortex under top-down modulation\u201d by Alireza Saeedi, Kun Wang, Ghazaleh\nNikpourian, Andreas Bartels, Nikos K.
