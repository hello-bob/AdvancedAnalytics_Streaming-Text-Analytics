My\ncolleagues call it \u201cdisinformation,\u201d and I generally do, too, but let\u2019s call\nit for what it is: lying. During this stretch, I have written more than 200\narticles and columns, and most of them were either about CEOs who lie, experts\nwho lie, scientists who lie, attorneys general who lie, legislators who lie,\nor a president who lies. And I\u2019m not talking about run-of-the-mill white lies.\nI\u2019m talking about lies that have grave consequences for the future of the\nplanet.\n\n(I should add that I also wrote 65 columns featuring Q&As with scientists and\nexperts who work for my organization, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).\nThey don\u2019t lie. They follow the science. The series is called \u201cAsk a\nScientist,\u201d and the last one I wrote will run in mid-May.)\n\nAfter a dozen years unmasking lies and five years before that overseeing UCS\u2019s\nmedia relations operation, I am leaving the organization. But before I walk\nout the door, I wanted to provide a retrospective of some of my columns on the\nbiggest sponsors of climate disinformation in the country: ExxonMobil CEO\nDarren Woods, his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, and Charles Koch, CEO of the\ncoal, oil and gas conglomerate Koch Industries.\n\n## See no evil\n\nI wrote more columns about ExxonMobil and its top executives than any other\nmajor source of climate lies. Most of these pieces were about the company\u2019s\nsupport for a seemingly independent network of anti-regulation, \u201cfree-market\u201d\nnonprofits that spread falsehoods about the reality and seriousness of climate\nchange. ExxonMobil spent at least $39 million on some 70 of these\norganizations from 1998 through 2020, more than any funder besides Charles\nKoch and his brother David, co-owner of Koch Industries until his death in\n2019.\n\nI first wrote about ExxonMobil in March 2013 after I saw the company\u2019s then-\nCEO, Rex Tillerson, on the Charlie Rose talk show, who provided me with fodder\nfor perhaps my favorite of two dozen ExxonMobil-related columns.\n\nRex Tillerson, ExxonMobil CEO from 2006 to 2016. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty\nImages)\n\nRose asked Tillerson open-ended questions on a range of subjects, including\nclimate change and national energy policy. And Rose did, at times, ask follow-\nup questions. But in nearly every instance, Rose listened politely, refrained\nfrom challenging Tillerson on the facts, and went on to his next question. So\nI decided to write a column in which I pretended to have been on the show\nalongside Tillerson, calling it \u201cRex & Me: The Charlie Rose Show You Should\nHave Seen Last Friday,\u201d a nod to Michael Moore\u2019s first film, Roger & Me.\n\nThe column featured excerpts from Rose and Tillerson\u2019s hour-long conversation\nwith comments I inserted as if I were sitting there in the studio rebutting\nTillerson\u2019s statements.\n\nRose first asked Tillerson about his take on global warming. Repeating his\ncompany\u2019s long-standing talking point, Tillerson emphasized scientific\nuncertainty, despite the fact that Exxon\u2019s own scientists had been warning\nmanagement about \u201cpotentially catastrophic\u201d human-caused global warming since\nat least 1977. \u201cWe have continued to study this issue for decades...,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThe facts remain there are uncertainties around the climate, climate\nchange, why it\u2019s changing, what the principal drivers of climate change are.\u201d\n\nIn my retelling of the show, I quickly pointed out that the UN\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had by then concluded that \u201cmost\u201d of\nthe increase in average global temperatures since 1950 was \u201cvery likely\u201d due\nto the increase in human-made carbon emissions.\n\nWhen Rose asked Tillerson if there is a link between extreme weather events\nand global warming, Tillerson told Rose that he had \u201cseen no scientific\nstudies to confirm [one].\u201d In the original broadcast, Rose went on to another\ntopic. But before he was able to do that in my imaginary scenario, I corrected\nthe record. \u201cThere is, in fact, substantial scientific evidence that there\u2019s a\nstrong link between global warming and heat waves and coastal flooding from\nsea-level rise,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a strong link to heavy precipitation\nand drought, depending on the region and time of the year.\u201d\n\nLater in the hour, Tillerson told Rose that the federal government should end\nsubsidies for renewable energy. \u201cI mean, wind has received subsidies for more\nthan 20 years now,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe if we took the subsidy off and it was\nchallenged and had to perform, people would take it to a new level.\u201d\n\nIt was a bogus argument that fossil fuel proponents would repeat ad nauseum\nover the next 10 years, so when Rose failed to provide some needed context, I\njumped in.\n\n\u201cRex,\u201d I interjected, \u201cit\u2019s bizarre that your top national energy priority is\nending federal support for renewables. ... [W]hat about the oil and gas\nindustry\u2019s subsidies and tax breaks?\u201d I then explained that, at the time, the\noil and gas industry had been receiving an average of $4.86 billion (in 2010\ndollars) in federal tax breaks and subsidies for nearly 100 years.\n\u201cRenewables,\u201d I added, \u201chave gotten peanuts in comparison.\u201d\n\nFour years later, when Tillerson testified before the Senate Foreign Relations\nCommittee after President Trump nominated him to be his secretary of state, a\nsenator asked him if he would pursue the Group of 20 pledge to eliminate\nfossil fuel subsidies. His reply? \u201cI\u2019m not aware of anything the fossil fuel\nindustry gets that I would characterize as a subsidy.\u201d\n\n## Still funding lies after all these years\n\nTillerson\u2019s successor, Darren Woods, now 59, has carried on his company\u2019s\ntradition of deceit. During an October 2021 hearing the House Oversight and\nReform Committee held on the oil industry\u2019s decades-long climate\ndisinformation campaign, Woods\u2014one of four oil company executives testifying\nthat day\u2014was asked if he would \u201ccommit right here to stop funding\norganizations that reject the science of climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not support climate denial,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe do not ask people to lobby\nfor anything different than our publicly supported [climate] positions.\u201d\n\nDarren Woods, ExxonMobil CEO from 2017 to the present. (Photo: Pool/Getty\nImages)\n\nThe history of that lie bears retelling. For years, ExxonMobil executives have\nacknowledged climate change is happening\u2014but not its cause\u2014and insisted they\nwant to be \u201cpart of the solution.\u201d And since 2015, they have claimed that\ntheir company supports the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which was\nbrokered that year. Why? ExxonMobil wants to be seen as a good corporate\ncitizen. It wants to protect what academics call its \u201csocial license,\u201d meaning\nthat it wants to be seen as being legitimate, credible and trustworthy. At the\nsame time, however, the company has continued to expand oil and gas\ndevelopment and fund climate science denier groups that undermine efforts to\naddress climate change.\n\nThe genesis of ExxonMobil\u2019s brazen hypocrisy can be traced back to 2007. In\nJanuary of that year, UCS released consultant (now UCS editorial director)\nSeth Shulman\u2019s report, \u201cSmoke, Mirrors and Hot Air: How ExxonMobil Uses Big\nTobacco\u2019s Tactics to Manufacture Uncertainty on Climate Science,\u201d revealing\nthat the company had spent $16 million between 1998 and 2005 on more than 40\nanti-regulation think tanks to launder its message. When asked by a Greenwire\nreporter a month later about the grantees identified in the UCS report,\nKenneth Cohen, then ExxonMobil\u2019s vice president of public affairs, said the\ncompany had stopped funding them. Hardly. In 2007 alone, the company gave $2\nmillion to 37 denier groups, including the American Legislative Exchange\nCouncil, Heartland Institute and Manhattan Institute.\n\nIn July 2015, after UCS discovered that Exxon (before it merged with Mobil)\nwas aware of the threat posed by climate change more than 30 years earlier and\nhad been intentionally deceiving the public for decades, reporters contacted\nExxonMobil spokesman Richard Keil for comment. One reporter asked him about\nExxonMobil\u2019s long history of funding climate change denier groups. \u201cI\u2019m here\nto talk to you about the present,\u201d Keil said. \u201c...We do not fund or support\nthose who deny the reality of climate change.\u201d\n\nI wrote a column a week later dissecting Keil\u2019s carefully crafted whopper.\n\u201cTechnically [Keil was correct], perhaps, because practically no one can say\nwith a straight face that global warming isn\u2019t happening anymore,\u201d I wrote.\n\u201cMost, if not all, of the people who used to deny the reality of climate\nchange have morphed into climate science deniers. They now concede that\nclimate change is real, but reject the scientific consensus that human\nactivity\u2014mainly burning fossil fuels\u2014is driving it. Likewise, they understate\nthe potential consequences, contend that we can easily adapt to them, and\nfight government efforts to curb carbon emissions and promote renewable\nenergy. ExxonMobil is still funding those folks, big time.\u201d\n\nBy its own accounting, ExxonMobil has continued to fund those folks\u2014albeit\nfewer of them\u2014to this day. For at least a decade, the company has been listing\nits grantees in its annual World Giving Report, and beginning in 2015 I wrote\na column every year citing how much it gave climate science denier groups the\nprevious year through 2021, when it stopped listing grantees receiving less\nthan $100,000. Previously, its reports included grants of $5,000 or more. That\nlack of transparency has made it impossible to discern exactly how much the\ncompany is still spending on climate disinformation, but nonetheless it\namounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nMy 2021 column on the company\u2019s grants from 2020, \u201cDespite Cutbacks,\nExxonMobil Continues to Fund Climate Science Denial,\u201d ran two days before\nWoods and top executives from BP America, Chevron and Shell testified before\nthe House Oversight Committee. Despite Woods\u2019s insistence at the hearing that\nhis company does not support \u201cclimate denial\u201d and does not ask its grantees to\nsupport anything other than its official climate-related pronouncements, three\nExxonMobil grantees that received at least $100,000 in 2020 contradicted the\ncompany\u2019s professed positions. They included a climate science-denying\neconomist at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), which has received more\nthan $5 million from ExxonMobil since 1998; George Washington University\u2019s\nanti-regulation Regulatory Studies Center, which opposed stronger efficiency\nstandards for home appliances and vehicles that would significantly reduce\ncarbon emissions; and the US Chamber of Commerce, which at the time dubiously\ncalled for \u201cthe increased use of natural gas\u201d to \u201cfurther progress\u201d in\naddressing climate change.\n\nSince I wrote that column, my last one on ExxonMobil\u2019s annual grants, the\ncompany\u2019s Worldwide Giving Report in 2022 indicated that in 2021, ExxonMobil\ncontributed another $150,000 to AEI and $150,000 to the GWU Regulatory Studies\nCenter. The company has yet to publish a report for its grantmaking in 2022,\nlet alone 2023.\n\n## Things go worse with Koch\n\nMy other b\u00eate noire is the 88-year-old libertarian industrialist Charles\nKoch\u2014the 22th-richest person in the world with a net worth of $67.6\nbillion\u2014and his network of uber-rich friends and \u201cfree-market\u201d think tanks and\nadvocacy groups. From 1997 through 2020, Koch family-controlled foundations\ndonated more than $160 million to at least 90 groups to manufacture doubt\nabout climate science and delay efforts to address global warming\u2014four times\nmore than even what ExxonMobil reportedly spent over the same time period.\n\nKoch is a lot more doctrinaire than his current counterpart at ExxonMobil.\nWoods downplays the central role human activity\u2014mainly burning fossil\nfuels\u2014plays in triggering climate change, but he has grudgingly conceded that\nglobal warming poses an \u201cexistential threat.\u201d Koch, by contrast, has never\nacknowledged that climate change is a serious problem and has questioned\u2014with\nno evidence\u2014the veracity of climate models, which studies have found to be\nquite accurate.\n\nCharles Koch, Koch Industries CEO from 1967 to the present. (Photo: Fortune\nConferences)\n\nFor more than two decades, the Koch network has been diligently spreading\ndisinformation to sabotage efforts to transition to a clean energy economy,\nmore often than not by attacking proposed climate policies on economic\ngrounds. Over the last 12 years, I wrote eight columns on the Koch network\u2019s\nescapades, including:\n\n  * Its attempt in 2012 to scare consumers about the cost of state renewable energy standards, which require utilities to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels by increasing their use of wind and solar power. In fact, such standards have had a negligible effect on electricity prices and often save ratepayers money.\n\n  * Its effort in 2013 to kill the federal production tax credit for wind, when the Koch-founded Americans for Prosperity and 100 other Koch network groups made the same disingenuous argument that Rex Tillerson made on the Charlie Rose show. \u201cAmericans deserve energy solutions that can make it on their own in the marketplace,\u201d they wrote in a letter to Congress, \u201cnot ones that need to be propped up by government indefinitely.\u201d\n\n  * Its 2018 campaign to kill a federal income tax credit for electric vehicle buyers, trotting out the same phony argument it made against wind tax breaks. The 18 Koch-funded groups that collaborated in the campaign, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Manhattan Institute, and the Koch-founded American Energy Alliance and Americans for Prosperity, argued that the government shouldn\u2019t subsidize any energy technologies, but confined their objections to tax breaks for clean energy alternatives, again falsely claiming\u2014like Tillerson\u2014that the oil and gas industry receives no subsidies.\n\nBut my favorite Koch column is my most recent one, \u201cIt\u2019s Time for Charles Koch\nto Testify About His Climate Change Disinformation Campaign,\u201d which ran in\nMarch 2022. I urged the House Oversight Committee to pull Koch in for\nquestioning before it ended its investigation given the fact that he \u201cis as\nconsequential a disinformer as the four oil company executives who testified\nlast fall ... combined.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the committee did not take my advice, but the column did give\nme the opportunity to report on the considerable amount Koch Industries\u2019\npolitical action committees (PACs) and employees spend on campaign\ncontributions, how much the company spends on lobbying, and the fact at least\n50 Koch network alumni landed key positions in the Trump administration. They\nincluded Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Energy Secretary Rick Perry,\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, White House\nLegislative Affairs Director Marc Short, and ... Vice President Mike Pence,\nwho led Trump\u2019s transition team. Egged on by Koch devotees both inside and\noutside the government\u2014as well as by more than 60 executive branch staff from\nthe Koch-funded Heritage Foundation\u2014the Trump administration rolled back at\nleast 260 regulations, including more than 100 environmental safeguards.\n\n## Is the day of reckoning coming?\n\nAs I said at the beginning of this essay, the lies uttered and underwritten by\nthe Koch brothers and ExxonMobil executives\u2014as well as their employees and\nPACs\u2019 generous campaign contributions to climate science deniers in\nCongress\u2014have had serious consequences.\n\nLast year, the United States suffered an unprecedented number of climate\nchange-related billion-dollar disasters, including record heat waves, drought,\nwildfires and floods, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration. The 28 extreme weather events collectively caused nearly $93\nbillion in damage. Last year also was hottest in at least 173 years, according\nto the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The annual temperature was 1.48\ndegrees Celsius (2.66 degrees Fahrenheit) above the preindustrial average.\n\nWhile the world is burning up, oil industry profits last year\u2014while lower than\nin 2022\u2014were still quite robust. The two US oil giants, ExxonMobil and\nChevron, netted $36 billion and $21.3 billion respectively. Chevron CEO Mike\nWirth, one of the oil company executives who testified before the House\nOversight Committee in October 2021, boasted that Chevron \u201creturned more cash\nto shareholders and produced more oil and natural gas [in 2023] than any year\nin the company\u2019s history.\u201d Meanwhile, Koch Industries\u2019 annual revenue was $115\nbillion last year, down slightly from $125 billion in 2022. (Because the\ncompany is privately held, it is not required to divulge profit data.)\n\nCities, counties, states and US territories are now taking steps to hold these\nand other fossil fuel companies, as well as their trade associations,\naccountable. So far, some 40 of them have filed 28 lawsuits in state and\nterritory courts for fraud and damages. Chicago and Bucks County,\nPennsylvania, 30 miles north of Philadelphia, are the most recent\nmunicipalities to file a climate lawsuit. In both cases, the defendants\ninclude BP America, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Philips 66 and Shell,\nas well as the American Petroleum Institute (API), the oil industry\u2019s biggest\ntrade association.\n\nExxonMobil has been named as a defendant in all of the cases. To date, Koch\nIndustries has been named in only one, filed by the state of Minnesota in June\n2020. That lawsuit alleges that API, ExxonMobil and Koch Industries, which\nowns an oil refinery in the state, violated state consumer protection laws by\nmisleading Minnesotans about the role fossil fuels play in causing the climate\ncrisis.\n\nAs I pointed out in a column about Minnesota\u2019s lawsuit, the state has a\nstoried history when it comes to such litigation. It was one of the first\nstates to sue the tobacco industry, and its lawsuit in the 1990s\u2014the only one\nthat made it to trial\u2014resulted in a groundbreaking settlement of $6 billion\nover the first 25 years and $200 million annually thereafter. The case also\npried 35 million pages of documents from tobacco company files revealing\ndetails of the industry\u2019s campaign to sow doubt about the links between\nsmoking and disease. As UCS pointed out in its 2007 expos\u00e9 of ExxonMobil\u2019s\nclimate disinformation campaign, the tobacco and fossil fuel industries used\nmany of the same strategies and tactics.\n\nUS climate litigation is only expected to grow this year, following the US\nSupreme Court\u2019s rejection of the oil industry\u2019s attempts to transfer climate\nlawsuits from state courts to federal courts, where industry lawyers believe\nthey are more likely to prevail. If the lawsuits are ultimately successful,\ncourts could order oil companies and their trade associations to pay out\nhundreds of billions of dollars to impacted communities.\n\nThat eventuality, much like the deserved comeuppance the tobacco industry\nreceived, would be a just outcome. But even a huge payout wouldn\u2019t begin to\ncompensate for the damage already done by Koch and ExxonMobil lies.\n\nPosted in: Climate Change, Corporate Accountability, Energy\n\nTags: Charles Koch, climate change, Darren Woods, ExxonMobil, Global warming,\nKoch Brothers, Rex Tillerson\n\n## Share\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn\n\nAbout the author\n\nMore from Elliott\n\nElliott writes about UCS-related topics for a range of news organizations.\nPrior to joining UCS, Elliott was the Washington communications director for\nthe Natural Resources Defense Council, a foreign news editor at National\nPublic Radio, the managing editor of American Journalism Review, and the\neditor of Nuclear Times and Public Citizen magazines.\n\n## More like this\n\nFrank Schulenburg/Wikimedia Commons\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\n## New California Legislation Would Help Us Better Understand Wildfire Health\nImpacts\n\nDaniel Barad Western States Policy Manager\n\nUpasana Khatri\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n## A Call for Climate Justice at the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights\n\nL.
