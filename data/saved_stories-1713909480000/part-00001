Harvard Libraries, ^olvwork289691A group\nphoto of computers at Harvard together with Mary Anna Palmer Draper, aka Mrs.\nHenry Draper. She's seated in the middle. After her husband's death, she\ncontributed a significant sum of money to continue her late husbands' dream of\nscientific astrophotograpy, leading to the Draper Catalog, an ambitious\nproject of the Observatory. Many, though not all, computers were funded for\nthis project.Harvard dates this as 1891. It seems to be approximately the same\ntime as other photos with similar groups of women, taken in the same room. I\nthink there were two pairs of photos taken on different days.The photo was\ntaken in the long computing room (see 1876 floor plans) on the south side of\nthe second floor (the top floor, excluding the dome) of the building. The\nphotograph was taken facing east, and the doorway in the photo is the closet\nshown in the floor plan.Left to right:\n\n* unknown (standing)\n* unknown (seated)\n* possibly Eve Leland\n* Mrs. Draper (seated)\n* Antonia Maury\n* Williamina Fleming\n* possibly Mabel C.

It has to\nbe after Dec. 1889, based on the graph on the wall of \u03b2 Aurig\u04d5, just behind\nAntonia Maury (who is credited for discovering that it is a binary star). And\nas it was published in an April 1892 New England Magazine, thta's the upper\nlimit on the photo.This is the same location as the photos with Mrs. Draper\nand some of the computers, the larger computing room on the top floor of the\nwest wing of the Observatory.From left to right:\n\n* possibly Mabel Stevens\n* unknown\n* Antonia Maury\n* possibly Eve Leland (seated)\n* Williamina Fleming\n* unknown\n* unknown\n* probably Florence Cushman  \n[link]1891Earliest source: \"[Observatory computer room and staff], 1891.\"\nHarvard University Archives / HUV 1210 (9-4). Harvard Libraries,\n^olvwork289689Nearly the identical photo as the previous, but with Pickering\nadded standing on the left. Obviously taken the same day.Note that the women\ndid not work this closely. As can be seen in the above photos with Mrs.\nDraper, the room is larger and they are crowded together for sake of the\nphotograph. There were between three and five rooms total for the computing\nwork, and by my best guess about 15 women worked there at that time, as well\nas at least five men. Still cramped, but not this cramped.The following year,\na brick building was constructed to help out with the space issues.  \n[link]1891Earliest source: \"Observatory [analysis of stellar spectra], 1891.\"\nHarvard University Archives / HUV 1210 (9-6).

Stevens, and she's wearing\nthe same dress as one of the women of women computers in the old building with\nFleming. Fleming appears to be wearing the same dress also, but without the\njacket.This photo was taken on the same floor as that other photo, but in a\nthe other computer room at the oppisite side of the building.  \n[link]1896ish Annie Jump Cannon while at RadcliffeEarliest source: \"Portrait\nof Annie Jump Cannon.\" Radcliffe College Archives / PC 70-1-2. Harvard\nLibraries, ^olvwork353777The earliest image I've found so far of Annie Jump\nCannon. This is what Harvard says: \"Inscription: Verso: Miss Annie Jump Cannon\nof the Harvard observatory, taken while doing graduate work at Radcliffe\nCollege\", and dates it 1895-1897. This would put her at about 33 years old.\nShe had taken ten years off for lack of available work between Wellesley and\nRadcliffe. During this she took up photography, published a small book of\nphotographs^footsteps, caught scarlet fever, and lost most of her\nhearing.^wikicannonI have a small suspicion based on her appearance in other\nphotos that this photo may be much earlier than Harvard's 1896 date, but so\nfar nothing to back it up.Use/Copyright: Radcliffe College Archives: This\nimage may not be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means,\nelectronic or mechanical, without permission in writing from the Radcliffe\nArchives.  \n[link]1898/3Earliest source: \"[Observatory data analysis by women computers]\n.\" Harvard University Archives / UAV 630.271 (E4116). Harvard Libraries,\n^olvwork432388Women computers working (or posing as if they're working) in a\nroom in the new brick building, built in 1892.I've dated this photo to March\nof 1898 based on a calendar visible in the image. The year is not actually\nlegible, but it's a year in which the first was a Tuesday. It also appears\n(not very clearly) as if the calendar is marked with quarter moon phases, and\nbased on this interpretation, it can only be 1898.Williamina Fleming is\nstanding. Immediatly in front of her are Eve Leland (back row center) and Ida\nWoods to the right. The rest are unidentified, although the woman closest to\nthe camera could be A. J. Cannon.Note: Harvard identifies this as a photo\nincluding Henrietta Leavitt. She does not appear in this photo.  \n[link]1900ishEarliest source: \"[Women on-board ship, ca. 1900].\" Harvard\nUniversity Archives / UAV 630.271 (173). Harvard Libraries, ^olvwork431825A\ngroup of women, most or all computers from the Observatory, on board the C.S.\nMinia, a cable repair ship. On the early end for possible dates of this\npicture, Mabel Gill (holding Fleming's hand) was hired in 1892 (assuming she\nhad been hired at this point). At the other end, Fleming passed away in\n1911.The Minia became famous as one of two ships primarily responsible for\npicking up survivors (and bodies) after the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.\nBefore that, the Minia was a well-known ship under Captain Trott, also well-\nknown for his ability to find and repair broken transatlantic telegram cables,\nin the deepest seas and the worst weather. He was also known for his\nhospitality when in port, and this photo could simply have been an opportunity\nto visit the ship, although he is not one of the gentlemen in this\npicture.William Squares DeCarteret took over as captain in 1899 after Trott\npassed away, and James Adams became his chief officer. In her 1900 journal,\nWilliamina Fleming specifically mentions a letter from \"Captain Adams\" about\nthe Minia. James Adams did eventually become captain of the Minia but it seems\nto be at a later date. At any rate, Miss Fleming apparently had some direct\nconnection with an officer on the ship.Another possible connection would be\nthe Observatory's early interest in telegraphy; they might have had much more\ndirect contact with the ship than your average telegraph customer.\nTransatlantic cables were used for clock synchronization and precise longitude\ndeterminations from the very beginning. In 1873, Joseph Lovering published On\nthe Determination of Transatlantic Longitudes by Means of the Telegraphic\nCables.Also, Captain Trott and at least one crewman were members of the Nova\nScotia Institute of Science, which sent their proceedings to the Observatory,\nso it's possible there were other connections between this ship and the\nObservatory also.Left to right:\n\n* probably William Squares De Carteret *\n* unknown man\n* unknown woman\n* Mabel Gill\n* unknown woman\n* unknown man\n* Williamina Fleming\n* probably Florence Cushman\n* either Mabel Stevens or A J Cannon**\n* unknonwn woman\n* probably James Adams *\n* probably Eve Leland\n* possibly Ida Woods*I found photos of both captain De Carteret and Adams, and I think it's at least possible that these men are those men, but I may have them reversed as they look like brothers to me.**I think it looks more like Cannon, and I want it to be her because I actually have no other images (besides very large group shots at conferences) with Fleming and Cannon together. BUT, reasonable estimates of this photo's date would put Cannon in the 35 to 40 range. If this is her she certainly looks MUCH younger than the 1902 photo I have of her.  \n[link]1902+Earliest source: \"[Williamina Fleming at Harvard College\nObservatory plate stacks, ca. 1900].\" Harvard University Archives / UAV\n630.271 (388). Harvard Libraries, ^olvwork432040Williamina Fleming at Harvard\nCollege Observatory plate stacks. These are the \"new\" plate stacks in the\nbrick building addition, built in 1902.  \n[link]1911 Women ComputersEarliest source: \"Observatory Group [photographic\ngroup portrait, ca. 1910].\" Harvard University Archives / HUPSF Observatory\n(14). Harvard Libraries, ^olvwork360662Harvard calls this photo \"Observatory\nGroup\", ca. 1910. The Internet often calls it a photo of \"Pickering's Harem\".\nI think it's from mid-1911. The lack of Williamina Fleming certainly makes it\nlikely to be after 1911 when she passed away, and Henrietta Leavitt, also\nabsent from the photo, was out of town until late 1911. The photo was taken in\nthe front of the Astrophotographic Library aka, the \"Brick Building\", aka\n\"Building C.\"\"Pickering's Harem\" may be a modern sexist invention rather than\na historic one. I've found no references earlier than 1976 for this phrase. On\nthe other hand, they were much more polite about what the wrote down back\nthen, so it may just as well be a real nickname passed down by oral\ntradition.One source that DOES use that nickname, from 1982, also lists a very\ndetailed description of the women in this photo, which I'll just quote here\ndirectly:\"At the far left of the photograph is Margaret Harwood (AB Radcliffe\n1907, MA University of California 1916), who had just completed her first year\nas Astronomical Fellow at the Maria Mitchell Observatory. She was later\nappointed director there, the first woman to be appointed director of an\nindependent observatory. Beside her in the back row is Mollie O'Reilly, a\ncomputer from 1906 to 1918. Next to Pickering is Edith Gill, a computer since\n1889. Then comes Annie Jump Cannon (BA Wellesley 1884), who at that time was\nabout halfway through classifying stellar spectra for the Henry Draper\nCatalogue. Behind Miss Cannon is Evelyn Leland, a computer from 1889 to 1925.\nNext is Florence Cushman, a computer since 1888. Behind Miss Cushman is Marion\nWhyte, who worked for Miss Cannon as a recorder from 1911 to 1913. At the far\nright of this row is Grace Brooks, a computer from 1906 to 1920. Ahead of Miss\nHarwood in the front row is Arville Walker (AB Radcliffe 1906), who served as\nassistant from 1906 until 1922. From 1922 until 1957 she held the position of\nsecretary to Harlow Shapley, who succeeded Pickering as Director. The next\nwoman may be Johanna Mackie, an assistant from 1903 to 1920. She received a\ngold medal from the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO)\nfor discovering the first nova in the constellation of Lyra. In front of\nPickering is Alta Carpenter, a computer from 1906 to 1920. Next is Mabel Gill,\na computer since 1892. And finally, Ida Woods (BA Wellesley 1893), who joined\nthe corps of women computers just after graduation. In 1920 she received the\nfirst AAVSO nova medal; by 1927, she had seven bars on it for her discoveries\nof novae on photographs of the Milky Way.\"^pickeringsharem  \n[link]1918 Women ComputersEarliest source: \"[Observatory Staff in \"paper doll\"\npose, (in line holding hands) panoramic photograph ca. 1918].\" Harvard\nUniversity Archives / UAV 630.271 (391).

This is an addition to the director's residence added in about 1893 that maybe doubled the size of the residence. The building is not curved, and the brick building to the right is the end of the astrophotographic addition, lying in the same plane. The wide angle just makes it look like a 90 degree bend.  \n[link]1925 \"As We Were\"Earliest source: \"Observatory Women [photographic group\nportrait, 1925].\" Harvard University Archives / HUPSF Observatory (19).\nHarvard Libraries, ^olvwork360663Harvard says the caption is \"As We Were\" in\nthe upper left corner, but they must not have scanned that or it is on the\nback.

They've been scanned by their owner, Charles Reynes, who's\nthe great grandson of Edward Skinner King (who was almost certainly at the\nperformance - he's in the group photo for the AAS conference where the play\nwas staged). They are by far the best quality images I've found anywhere of\nthe performance, and three of them haven't been found anywhere else.I'm having\na particular problem with two identifications from these photographs: G. W.\nWheelwright as Winslow Upton and W. R. Ransom as Pickering. I'm hoping to\nidentify the characters from the context of the photos, but at this point I'm\nnot sure that will work. From the opposite end, I've attempted to find\nphotographs of both Wheelwright and Ransom in other contexts.
