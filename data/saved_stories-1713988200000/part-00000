It generally does not remove genetic material, Nuzzo said, but\ntypically renders pathogens unable to cause harm to people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe greater concern, however, \u201cis that it\u2019s showing up in a lot more samples,\nmeaning the infection is more widespread in dairy herds than we thought,\u201d said\none public health official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share\ninformation not yet made public.\n\nIn a four-page statement, the FDA said some of the samples collected have\n\u201cindicated the presence\u201d of the bird flu virus based on testing that detects\nviral particles but does not distinguish whether they are active or dead. The\nfinding of virus \u201cdoes not mean that the sample contains an intact, infectious\npathogen,\u201d the agency\u2019s statement said.\n\nAdditional laboratory testing is underway to grow the virus in cells and in\nfertilized eggs, the latter being the \u201cgold standard\u201d for sensitive detection\nof active, infectious virus, the FDA said. \u201cImportantly, additional testing is\nrequired to determine whether intact pathogen is still present and if it\nremains infectious, which determines whether there is any risk of illness\nassociated with consuming the product,\u201d the FDA statement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFDA officials said results are expected in the next few days to weeks.\n\n\u201cTo date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the\ncommercial milk supply is safe,\u201d the agency said in its statement.\n\nOfficials and experts did not have additional details about the number of milk\nsamples that were positive for particles of bird flu or where the samples\noriginated.\n\nAlthough this strain of avian flu has been circulating for more than 20 years,\nits leap into cows is of substantial concern, surprising even longtime\nobservers of the virus. More than two dozen livestock herds in at least eight\nstates have been infected with avian flu since March 25, prompting\ninvestigations by federal and state officials.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFor weeks, key federal agencies have expressed confidence in the safety of the\ncommercial milk supply, including pasteurized products sold at grocery stores.\nThe FDA has highlighted data showing pasteurization inactivates other viruses\nand pointed to studies showing that the pasteurization process for eggs \u2014\nwhich occurs at a lower temperature than what is used for milk \u2014 deactivates\nthe highly pathogenic avian influenza.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe International Dairy Foods Association, which represents the nation\u2019s dairy\nmanufacturing and marketing industry, said that viral fragments are \u201cnothing\nmore than evidence that the virus is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cMilk and milk products produced and processed in the United States are among\nthe safest in the world,\u201d spokesman Matt Herrick wrote in an email, adding\nthat \u201cviral fragments are simply indicative of pasteurization doing its job\neffectively and protecting our commercial milk supply.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn recent weeks, multiple experts expressed confidence that the pasteurization\nprocess ensures there is no threat to the safety of the nation\u2019s milk supply\nbut said the federal government should still perform tests to confirm that is\nthe case.\n\nFlu is a \u201cfairly wimpy virus,\u201d meaning it is \u201cfairly readily inactivated,\u201d\nsaid Richard J. Webby, a virologist at St Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s something that has to be tested.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne case of avian flu has been reported in a Texas farmworker in recent weeks,\nonly the second human case ever of bird flu in the United States.\n\nSo far, the virus has not acquired the ability to spread efficiently in\npeople.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut as it is able to jump from animal to animal, prospects increase for it\nmutating to cause sustained person-to-person transmission \u2014 a development that\ncould fuel a pandemic.\n\nState health officials have tested 23 people with flu-like symptoms, but only\nthe dairy worker in Texas has tested positive during the current outbreak.\nOngoing surveillance of emergency department visits and flu tests in regions\nwhere bird flu has been detected has not flagged unusual trends in flu-like\nillnesses, or eye inflammation, the only symptom experienced by the dairy\nworker, according to officials at the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, who say the risk to the general public of bird flu remains low.\n\nThe lack of more human cases is a good sign, health officials say.\n\nThe key to containing the outbreak resides in livestock herds. Testing of cows\nis voluntary. U.S. Department of Agriculture protocols restrict testing to\ncows with specific symptoms and limits the number of tests per farm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nFeel-good stories\n\nNews that brims with optimism\n\nHe got a college degree while he was in prison.
