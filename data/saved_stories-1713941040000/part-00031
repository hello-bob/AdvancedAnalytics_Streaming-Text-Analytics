It is\nalso unclear if the same benefits of napping would be seen in people without a\npredisposition.\n\nProf Tara Spires-Jones, the president of the British Neuroscience Association,\na group leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute, and deputy director of\nthe Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh,\nwelcomed the study, although she said it had limitations including that the\nself-reported napping habits of UK Biobank participants may not be entirely\naccurate.\n\n\u201cThis study is important because it adds to the data indicating sleep is\nimportant for brain health,\u201d she said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Neuroscience\n  * Ageing\n  * Sleep\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### \u2018Like a film in my mind\u2019: hyperphantasia and the quest to understand vivid imaginations\n\n3d ago\n\n  * ### Keep winning at tennis?
