Schaub\n\nApril 22, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EDT\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nListen\n\n5 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nEve O. Schaub is the author of \u201cYear of No Garbage: Recycling Lies, Plastic\nProblems, and One Woman\u2019s Trashy Journey to Zero Waste.\u201d\n\nThe time has come for us to stop \u201crecycling\u201d plastic. Plastic as a material is\nnot recyclable, and the very best thing we can do to celebrate Earth Day this\nyear is to acknowledge that fact.\n\nThis seems counterintuitive, I know. We\u2019ve been told for decades that the\nanswer to the plastic-waste crisis is more, better recycling: If only we\nsorted better! If only we had better access to recycling technologies! If only\nwe washed and dried our plastics more adequately! This is all a smokescreen,\ndesigned to distract us from the truth that plastic recycling \u2014 if by\n\u201crecycling\u201d we mean converting a used material into a new material of similar\nvalue and function \u2014 is a myth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nUnlike paper, glass and metal, plastic is not easily, efficiently turned into\nnew products. What passes for \u201crecycling\u201d plastic is costly, energy-intensive\nand toxic. On top of all that, the process requires the addition of a shocking\namount of new virgin plastic \u2014 around 70 percent \u2014 to hold the newly formed\nplastic item together. As a result, only about 5 percent of plastic gets\n\u201crecycled\u201d (or, more accurately, \u201cdowncycled\u201d into a product of inferior\nquality). Compare that with a 68 percent recycling rate for paper and\ncardboard.\n\nConsidering that, as a society, we\u2019ve been actively trying to get better at\nplastic recycling since the 1970s, 5 percent represents a colossal,\nunequivocal failure. It tells us that plastic \u201crecycling\u201d is, at heart, an\nempty, performative gesture.\n\nMany environmentalists will protest this assertion. They might correctly point\nout that plastics labeled with the resin identification code of 1 or 2 (the\nnumber inside the \u201cchasing arrows\u201d triangle on many plastics) have a higher\nmeasure of recycling success: about 30 percent. Shouldn\u2019t we support recycling\nat least this plastic?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFor a long time, I thought so.\n\nBut this brings us to another myth: that plastic is harmless to human health.\nWhat many people do not know is that plastic is made from two ingredients:\nfossil fuels and toxic chemicals. When we say toxic chemicals, we are talking\nabout some very bad actors: heavy metals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\n(PFAS), flame retardants and persistent organic pollutants. Tens of thousands\nof proprietary chemical formulas are involved in the production of plastic,\nmost of which have never been tested for their effects on human health,\nalthough many are known to be endocrine disruptors, fertility inhibitors and\ncarcinogens.\n\nWhat this means is that even if we were to get better at recycling plastic, we\nshouldn\u2019t want to. When you grind up, melt and re-form a bunch of plastic\n(with the addition of lots of new virgin plastic to bind it together), all\nthose thousands of toxic plastic chemicals combine to make a Frankenstein\nmaterial that has what scientists call \u201cnon-intentionally added substances\u201d in\nit. Which is to say that chemicals that are not supposed to be there start\nshowing up. A study last year concluded that recycled plastics contain \u201can\nunknown number of chemical compounds at unknown concentrations.\u201d In 2021, a\nCanadian study concluded that plastic is \u201cnot suitable for processing into\nfood grade PCR,\u201d referring to post-consumer resin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe upshot? You do not want your food wrapped in recycled, mystery-ingredient\nplastic.\n\nBut what if we use recycled plastic only for nonfood items such as picnic\nbenches? Then we have yet another deeply troubling aspect of plastic to deal\nwith: microplastics. We\u2019ve been hearing more and more about these lately,\nbecause scientists are finding them everywhere they look \u2014 in the environment\nand in the human body.\n\nThe chemical composition of all plastic \u2014 whatever the type \u2014 is a synthetic\npolymer that doesn\u2019t break down or go away, ever. Instead, it breaks up into\nsmaller and smaller pieces until it turns into microplastics or even\nnanoplastics. These tiny particles are still plastic, still toxic, but now so\nsmall that we are eating and breathing them all the time. Microplastics have\nbeen discovered in human lungs, bloodstream and breastmilk, as well as in the\nplacenta of unborn babies. Scientists have found microplastics in sperm,\ntestes and the brain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe effect of all this plastic in our bodies is still being revealed, but we\nknow it is substantial. A recent study concluded that the disease burden from\nplastic exposure includes preterm birth, obesity, heart disease and cancer,\nand the health-care cost was $249 billion in 2018 alone. The human body has\nbecome the trash can of our plastics-addicted culture.\n\nTrying to recycle plastic makes the microplastics problem even worse. A study\nof just one plastics recycling facility discovered that it might be washing 3\nmillion pounds of microplastics into its wastewater every year \u2014 all of which\nends up being deposited in our city water systems or dumped into the\nenvironment.\n\nAt this very moment, we all have microplastics coursing through our bodies.\nThis is not the fault of not enough recycling. This is the fault of too much\nplastic. So I say: Let\u2019s treat plastic like the toxic waste it is and send it\nwhere it can hurt people the least.\n\nRight now, that place is the landfill.\n\nThen we need to get to work on the real solution: making a whole lot less of\nit.\n\n### About guest opinion submissions\n\nThe Washington Post accepts opinion articles on any topic.
