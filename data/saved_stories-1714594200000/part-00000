Block did not correct\ncompany processes when it was alerted to the breaches, the former employee\ntold prosecutors and NBC News.\n\nRoughly 100 pages of documents the former employee provided to NBC News\nidentify transactions, many in small dollar amounts, involving entities in\ncountries subject to U.S. sanctions restrictions \u2014 Cuba, Iran, Russia and\nVenezuela \u2014 as recently as last year.\n\n\u201cFrom the ground up, everything in the compliance section was flawed,\u201d the\nformer employee told NBC News. \u201cIt is led by people who should not be in\ncharge of a regulated compliance program.\u201d\n\nA second person with direct knowledge of Block\u2019s monitoring programs and\npractices echoed that assessment; NBC News granted the former employee and the\nsecond person anonymity to guard against potential reprisals.\n\nThe Southern District of New York did not respond to a request for comment\nabout the inquiry.\n\nJack Dorsey at the Bitcoin 2021 Conference in Miami in June 2021. Eva Marie\nUzcategui / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nEdward Siedle, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer who\nrepresents the former employee and participated in the discussions with\nprosecutors, said, \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding from the documents that compliance\nlapses were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years.\u201d\n\nProsecutors met with the former employee after NBC News reported in mid-\nFebruary that two other whistleblowers had told financial regulators about\ncompliance failures at Cash App, the hugely popular mobile payment platform\nowned by Block. Cash App, introduced in 2013, allows users to send and receive\nmoney instantaneously among themselves and to buy stocks and Bitcoin. As of\nDecember, Cash App had 56 million active transacting accounts and $248 billion\nin inflows during the previous four quarters, the company said.\n\nAsked about the probe, a Block spokeswoman provided the following statement:\n\u201cBlock has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly\nadapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions\nregulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and\nprocesses for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on\nsanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations. Continually\nimproving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for\nBlock. We have been and remain committed to building upon this work, as well\nas continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.\u201d\n\n### Recommended\n\nEconomy\n\n### EconomyFederal Reserve not expected to budge on interest rates yet as\ninflation holds its grip\n\nBusiness News\n\n### Business NewsNBC Sports could buy back rights to 'Roundball Rock' if it\nairs NBA games again, composer John Tesh says\n\nThe company said it believed it had voluntarily reported the \u201cthousands of\ntransactions\u201d described by the former employee to the Office of Foreign Assets\nControl, or OFAC, a department of the U.S. Treasury that enforces economic\nsanctions. But the former employee disputed that, saying thousands of\ndifferent transactions were not reported.\n\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 31 secondsVolume 90%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n02:31\n\n02:31\n\nTwitter co-founder Jack Dorsey steps down as CEO\n\n02:31\n\nSquare, the other main business unit at Block, is a financial services\nplatform used by millions of merchants. Documents provided to prosecutors and\nreviewed by NBC News identify instances at Square when it failed to conduct\nbasic customer due diligence on its international merchant sellers and\nimproperly reimbursed some of the merchants\u2019 funds that had been frozen for\nsanctions violations. (Merchants are considered customers at Square, while\nusers are considered customers at Cash App.) New customers at both Square and\nCash App who triggered sanctions alerts at their initial screenings were\npermitted to conduct transactions before the alerts were resolved, the\ndocuments say. They also show instances of employees\u2019 flagging that customer\nbiography information, such as linked social media accounts, was not screened\nagainst sanctions keyword lists.\n\nCash App\u2019s design increased the risk of compliance lapses, the documents\nindicate. \u201cDue to the nature of the product,\u201d a document said, \u201ccustomers do\nnot appear to leave stored balances in Cash App very long so our ability to\nblock a stored balance or reject funds is limited. In virtually all\nsituations, balances have been depleted by the time of review.\u201d\n\nThe former employee also told prosecutors about the findings of an outside\nconsultant Block hired to assess its internal systems for monitoring\nsuspicious activities, rating customer risks and screening for sanctions\nviolations. The consultant identified almost 50 deficiencies in those systems\nlast year, the documents show.\n\nIn its response to NBC News, the company said the hiring of the consultant\nshowed Block\u2019s commitment to perform and improve compliance, adding that 50\ndeficiencies were not unusual given the report\u2019s scope. The former employee\u2019s\ninterpretation of the report misconstrues its findings and their significance,\nthe company said.\n\nThe company declined to answer questions about the specific deficiencies cited\nin the documents. It said that when deficiencies are identified, Block works\n\u201cwith our in-house legal team, as well as with outside counsel and\nconsultants, to advise us on the issue and appropriate remediation.\u201d The\ncompany conducts recurring sanctions screening on all merchants, it said, and\nits program includes the essential components expected by OFAC.\n\nOFAC administers and enforces economic sanctions to protect the nation against\n\u201ctargeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists and terrorist\norganizations, weapons of mass destruction proliferators, narcotic\ntraffickers, and others,\u201d according to its website. It \u201cstrongly encourages\u201d\ncompanies to develop, implement and routinely update sanctions compliance\nprograms. \u201cSenior management\u2019s commitment to, and support of, an\norganization\u2019s risk-based sanctions compliance program is one of the most\nimportant factors in determining its success,\u201d OFAC says, and it is essential\nto fostering \u201ca culture of compliance throughout the organization.\u201d\n\nAlong with senior management, the Block board of directors was informed of\nextensive lapses at the company, the former employee told prosecutors. In\nrecent months, Block has announced the unexpected departures of two directors:\nLawrence Summers, the former U.S. treasury secretary and a Block director\nsince 2011, resigned in February, and in April it said Sharon Rothstein, a\ndirector since 2022, will not stand for re-election at the company\u2019s annual\nmeeting in June.\n\nBlock said that Summers and Rothstein were leaving the board to devote more\ntime to other professional and personal activities and that their departures\nwere not \u201ca result of any disagreements with the company on any matter\nrelating to the company\u2019s operations, policies or practices.\u201d\n\n0 seconds of 6 minutes, 52 secondsVolume 90%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n06:52\n\n06:52\n\nLarry Summers: Silicon Valley Bank crisis 'speaks to the need for much\nstronger regulation'\n\n06:52\n\nDuring his time on the board, Summers served on the audit committee, which is\ncharged with reviewing and discussing with management the company\u2019s program\nand policies on risk assessment and risk management. The committee is overseen\nby Lord Paul Deighton, a former Goldman Sachs executive who was commercial\nsecretary to the treasury in the U.K. government from 2013 to 2015. NBC News\nrequested interviews with Deighton and Summers, but they declined, forwarding\nthe requests to Block\u2019s corporate communications unit.\n\nBlock has encountered difficulties with regulators before. In late 2021, the\nFinancial Market Supervisory Committee of the Bank of Lithuania ordered Verse\nPayments Lithuania UAB, the company\u2019s European version of Cash App, to\ndetermine the identity of its existing clients whose identities had not been\nestablished or had been established out of compliance with the law on\nPrevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.\n\nVerse and its former head were fined last year when the Bank of Lithuania\ninspected Verse and \u201cfound serious and systematic violations of the prevention\nof money laundering and terrorism financing.\u201d The top Verse executive \u201cdid not\nensure the safe and reliable operation of the institution, did not take\neffective measures to eliminate violations and did not ensure the compliance\nof the institution\u2019s activities with the established requirements, although\ninformation about the violations committed by the institution was known to him\nfor a long time,\u201d the Bank of Lithuania said at the time.\n\nBlock shut down Verse last year. On an earnings call in August, Dorsey said\nthat Verse required significant investment and that its market had \u201cnot seen\nthe growth and profitability we had expected.\u201d\n\nMobile payment apps like Cash App, PayPal and Venmo are popular, with over\nthree-quarters of U.S. adults using them, according to a study last year by\nthe Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Known as person-to-person payment\nplatforms, the services pose risks to their users and to the financial system,\nregulators say. In recent years, for example, law enforcement officials have\ncited criminals\u2019 use of payment apps to evade laws, such as laundering stolen\nCovid relief funds in 2020.\n\nCash App is not a bank, but it uses external banking partners to conduct\nvarious services. One is Sutton Bank, the small Ohio institution that issues\nCash App\u2019s prepaid Visa debit cards, allowing users to spend or withdraw their\nfunds. Banks are required to know every one of their customers, but the Cash\nApp program \u201chad no effective procedure to establish the identity of its\ncustomers,\u201d the previous whistleblowers said in their complaints to federal\nfinancial regulators.\n\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 15 secondsVolume 90%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n02:15\n\n02:15\n\nCourt documents reveal details of dispute leading up to fatal stabbing of Cash\nApp founder\n\n02:15\n\nOn March 29, Sutton Bank settled a consent order with the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corp. that echoed the whistleblowers\u2019 allegations. In the order, the\nFDIC alleged \u201cunsafe or unsound banking practices and violations of law or\nregulation\u201d at Sutton, including those relating to the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nUnder the order, Sutton agreed to revise its internal programs to \u201cimprove its\nsupervision and direction\u201d of its anti-money laundering and terrorism\nfinancing program and \u201cto assure and maintain the Bank\u2019s full compliance with\nthe Bank Secrecy Act.\u201d Sutton also agreed to look back to July 2020 \u201cto ensure\nthat all required customer identification program information has been\nobtained and the bank has formed a reasonable belief that it knows the true\nidentity\u201d of its customers.\n\nThe FDIC order cited Sutton Bank\u2019s work with \u201cthird parties\u201d or outside\nentities and required it to provide details about anti-money-laundering\ncompliance and customer identification programs at the outside companies it\nworks with. The FDIC did not name Cash App in the order, but it is the largest\nthird party that Sutton Bank works with, according to its chief compliance\nofficer. The FDIC order also required Sutton to provide quarterly reporting of\n\u201cthird-party compliance with legal, contractual, and service level\nresponsibilities, and management actions to address anti-money laundering and\ncountering the financing of terrorism deficiencies.\u201d\n\nJames Booker, senior counsel at Sutton Bank, said in an email that the bank is\nworking closely with regulators and that the recent consent order \u201csettled\nsome longstanding issues concerning anti-money laundering controls\u201d that had\narisen \u201cprior to the bank\u2019s 2023 restructuring of its anti-money laundering\nprogram.\u201d\n\nAs for Block, it said the Sutton consent order was not likely to affect Cash\nApp\u2019s ongoing business relationship with the bank.\n\nGretchen Morgenson\n\nGretchen Morgenson is the senior financial reporter for the NBC News\nInvestigative Unit.
