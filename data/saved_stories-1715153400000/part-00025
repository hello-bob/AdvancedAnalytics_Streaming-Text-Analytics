DOI:\n10.1038/s43247-024-01357-z\n\nA team of paleoclimatologists with the U.S. Geological Survey, NASA Ames\nResearch Park, has found that atmospheric rivers in the past have dumped far\nmore rain on California than those that have occurred over the past two years.\n\nIn their paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment,\nthe group describes their study of sediment core samples collected from the\nbottom of Leonard Lake, in northern California.\n\nOver the past two winters, parts of California have seen much more rain than\nis normal for the region. The reason for it has been the creation of what have\ncome to be called atmospheric rivers over parts of the Pacific Ocean, which\ndump wave after wave of rain as they move over land.\n\nPrior research has suggested that atmospheric rivers used to be more common in\nthe region, and may have resulted in more rain than has been seen in modern\ntimes. Such studies have suggested that if certain conditions develop, more\natmospheric rivers could form in the future, and that they could be bigger,\nleading to more rainfall than has been seen thus far.\n\nFor this new study, the researchers focused on the history of atmospheric\nrivers dumping rain on California. They traveled to Leonard Lake in northern\nCalifornia to collect core sediment samples. The lake was chosen due to its\nrelatively stable history going back thousands of years and its geographical\nfeatures.\n\nThe team collected core soil samples by pushing soil samplers down to the lake\nbottom from a boat. Their samples reflected layers deposited over\napproximately 3,200 years. Rain events over the years have resulted in the\ncreation of sediment layers, allowing the team to see how much rain had fallen\nduring certain periods of California history.\n\nIn studying the core samples, the research team found evidence of the largest\natmospheric river events, which both exceeded those from recent years,\noccurring two and three millennia ago and dumping massive amounts of rainfall\nin the region.\n\nThe findings by the team are relevant because prior studies have suggested\nglobal warming is leading to the likelihood of more atmospheric rivers forming\nover the Pacific\u2014the sediment samples, the researchers note could be offering\na glimpse of what could be in California's future.\n\nMore information: Clarke A.
