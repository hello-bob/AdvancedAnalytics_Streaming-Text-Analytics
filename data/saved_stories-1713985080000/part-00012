Large parts of the string theory and quantum gravity\ncommunities did what they could to take advantage of this. On November 30,\n2022, this all of a sudden changed as two things happened on the same day:\n\n  * Quanta magazine, Nature and various other places were taken in by a publicity stunt, putting out that day videos and articles about how \u201cPhysicists Create a Wormhole Using a Quantum Computer\u201d. The IAS director compared the event to \u201cEddington\u2019s 1919 eclipse observations providing the evidence for general relativity.\u201d Within a few days though, people looking at the actual calculation realized that these claims were absurd. The subject had jumped the shark and started becoming a joke among serious theorists. That quantum computers more generally were not living up to their hype didn\u2019t help.\n  * OpenAI released ChatGPT, very quickly overwhelming everyone with evidence of how advanced machine learning-based AI had become.\n\nIf you\u2019re a theorist interested in getting funding, obviously the thing to do\nwas to pivot quickly from quantum computing to machine learning and AI, and\nget to work on the people at Quanta to provide suitable PR. Today Quanta\nfeatures an article explaining how \u201cUsing machine learning, string theorists\nare finally showing how microscopic configurations of extra dimensions\ntranslate into sets of elementary particles.\u201d\n\nLooking at these new neural network calculations, what\u2019s remarkable is that\nthey\u2019re essentially a return to a failed project of nearly 40 years ago. In\n1985 the exciting new idea was that maybe compactifying a 10d superstring on a\nCalabi-Yau would give the Standard Model. It quickly became clear that this\nwasn\u2019t going to work. A minor problem was that there were quite a few classes\nof Calabi-Yaus, but the really big problem was that the Calabi-Yaus in each\nclass were parametrized by a large dimensional moduli space. One needed some\nmethod of \u201cmoduli stabilization\u201d that would pick out specific moduli\nparameters. Without that, the moduli parameters became massless fields,\nintroducing a huge host of unobserved new long-range interactions. The state\nof the art 20 years later is that endless arguments rage over whether Rube\nGoldberg-like constructions such as KKLT can consistently stabilize moduli (if\nthey do, you get the \u201clandscape\u201d and can\u2019t calculate anything anyway, since\nthese constructions give exponentially large numbers of possibilities).\n\nIf you pay attention to these arguments, you soon realize that the underlying\nproblem is that no one knows what the non-perturbative theory governing moduli\nstabilization might be. This is the \u201cWhat Is String Theory?\u201d problem that a\nconsensus of theorists agrees is neither solved nor on its way to solution.\n\nThe new neural network twist on the old story is to be able to possibly\ncompute some details of explicit Calabi-Yau metrics, allowing you to compute\nsome numbers that it was clear back in the late 1980s weren\u2019t really relevant\nto anything since they were meaningless unless you had solved the moduli\nstabilization program. Quanta advertises this new paper and this one (which\n\u201copens the door to precision string phenomenology\u201d) as well a different sort\nof calculation which used genetic algorithms to show that \u201cthe size of the\nstring landscape is no longer a major impediment in the way of constructing\nrealistic string models of Particle Physics.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll end with a quote from the article, in which Nima Arkani-Hamed calls this\nwork \u201cgarbage\u201d in the nicest possible way:\n\n> \u201cString theory is spectacular. Many string theorists are wonderful. But the\n> track record for qualitatively correct statements about the universe is\n> really garbage,\u201d said Nima Arkani-Hamed, a theoretical physicist at the\n> Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nA question for Quanta: why are you covering \u201cgarbage\u201d?\n\nUpdate: String theorist Marcos Mari\u00f1o on twitter:\n\n> In my view, using today\u2019s AI to calculate the details of string\n> compactifications is such a waste of time that I fear that a future\n> Terminator will come to our present to take revenge for the merciless,\n> useless exploitation of its grandparents.\n\nThis entry was posted in This Week's Hype.

Low Math, Meely Interacting says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 8:04 pm\n\nBut isn\u2019t it amazing it took this long? It\u2019s the sort of problem the AI hype\nmachine was practically created for.\n\n  3. Peter Woit says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 8:12 pm\n\nLMMI, Actually people have been getting grants to use AI to supposedly study\nthe string theory landscape for quite a few years now. Before the AI hype\nboom, this was part of the Big Data hype boom.\n\nWhat\u2019s new is that Quanta finally got around to promoting this stuff. Unclear\nwhy that took so long, and why they waited until they had Arkani-Hamed on\nrecord describing it as garbage.\n\n  4. clueless_postdoc says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 9:00 pm\n\nThis is purely a layman perspective. I read your post, then I read the quanta\narticle. Never mind if what they\u2019re doing is science, let alone good science,\nbut if at some point people could write down a particular Calabi-Yau 3 fold,\nand say well if you compactify using this particular Calabi-Yau, you get the\nstandard model. That would be pretty interesting, no? From reading your blog\nand various popsci books, it seems previously this failed because people\nsimply did not have the computing power, but now it seems they do?\n\nRemark: \u201cnever mind if this is science....it would be pretty interesting?\u201d \u2013\nperhaps the reason I\u2019m paid by a (poor) math department instead of a physics\none.\n\n  5. Peter Woit says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 10:00 pm\n\nclueless postdoc, The problem is that Calabi-Yaus come with a large number\n(say order 100) parameters. These are going to give you 100 new long-range\ngravitational strength forces. This looks nothing like physics, it\u2019s what\nArkani-Hamed is referring to when he says \u201cthe track record for qualitatively\ncorrect statements about the universe is really garbage\u201d. This has nothing to\ndo with any computational difficulty. The reason people gave up on this in 80s\nwas not that the calculations were difficult, but that they were meaningless.\n\nIf you decide you\u2019re going to assume that you have some mechanism that\ndynamically fixes the moduli parameters to specific values, you can try and\ncalculate standard model parameters for the effective 4d theory with those\nfixed parameters. But the result would depend on 100 parameters, and not be\nbased on any underlying theory, again Arkani-Hamed\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d.\n\n  6. Dan Winslow says:\n\nApril 24, 2024 at 8:01 am\n\nWell...sure, classical computing AIs for this are probably worthless. That\u2019s\npretty obvious! However, one should think of the current effort as kind of a\ntune-up. When they start using AIs from QUANTUM computing, then maximum\nbuzzword density will have been achieved and the whole argument will collapse\ninto a single point of infinitely dense grant money.\n\n  7. clueless_postdoc says:\n\nApril 24, 2024 at 9:16 am\n\nHi Peter,\n\nThanks for the reply! Again I am very much a layman. I agree the first option\nis probably not physics. But take the second option, suppose you manually take\n100 or so parameters, fix them, and if my reading of the situation is correct,\nyou get some extension of standard model that includes gravity, in a\nreasonably consistent way? Never mind if this destroys any way of getting it\nout of a simple fundamental theory, my impression is that we don\u2019t currently\nhave any other way to do this (no other competing theory can go this far)?\n\nMy uninformed opinion, from a rather humble vantage point, is that having a\nRube-Goldberg machine that does at least something is better than having\nnothing at all. (Never mind how much hype is or would be generated from this)\n\n  8. Peter Woit says:\n\nApril 24, 2024 at 9:29 am\n\nclueless postdoc, The problem is that if you fix the moduli, by hand or by the\nKKLT Rube Goldberg mechanism, you don\u2019t have a consistent theory. You do have\nan essentially infinite number of things you can calculate, so you can try and\nkeep calculating, trying to make more and more complicated choices to get\nresults that are not in obvious disagreement with observation, but this can\u2019t\nlead to anything meaningful.\n\nI recommend that everyone interested in this follow the Twitter discussion\nwith Marcus Mari\u00f1o at\nhttps://twitter.com/marino_beiras/status/1783042977922699457 Mari\u00f1o is a\nstring theorist expert on the subject of Calabi-Yaus, so very well equipped to\nknow whether the calculations being advertised in Quanta are meaningful or\ngarbage.\n\n### Leave a Reply\n\n  * ### About\n\nPeter Woit\u2019s Home Page\n\n  * Follow @notevenwrong\n\n  * ### Quantum Theory, Groups and
