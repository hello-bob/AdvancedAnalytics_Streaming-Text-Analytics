They\nDon\u2019t.\n\n19 Comments / 19 New Leave a Comment\n\nThings you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\nlearn to code Feb. 19, 2020\n\n# Lambda School\u2019s Misleading Promises\n\nBy Vincent Woo\n\nLambda School founder Austen Allred Photo: Courtesy of TEDx/YouTube\n\nIf you visit the website of Lambda School, a \u201cboot camp\u201d for people who want\nto quickly learn how to code, you\u2019re greeted by a photograph of a grinning\nstudent with an open laptop and the encouraging words: \u201cYour new tech career\nstarts here.\u201d It\u2019s the first of many promises made by Lambda, which currently\nboasts 2,500 students, all of whom receive their education online from their\nown homes \u2014 and none of whom pay out of pocket for their educations, instead\nsigning \u201cIncome Sharing Agreements,\u201d or ISAs, through which Lambda gets a\npercentage of their first tech job after graduating.\n\nIf you recognize the name, it might be because of the $48 million in venture\nfunding it\u2019s raised in its nearly three years of existence, or its $150\nmillion valuation. VCs have been attracted to Lambda\u2019s ability to rapidly grow\nits enrollment via online-only instruction and the no up-front cost tuition\nenabled by the ISA model. But most likely it\u2019s because you\u2019ve seen the\ncompany\u2019s ubiquitous Facebook ads, or read some of the seemingly endless\ntweets about the company written by its executives, in particular its founder,\nAusten Allred. I personally became interested in the school after seeing a\n(now deleted) tweet by one of Lambda\u2019s executives, Trevor McKendrick, in which\nhe claimed that \u201cif you don\u2019t think Lambda is at least a $100B company you\ndon\u2019t understand the American economy.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think Lambda is a $100B company, regardless of whether I understand\nthe American economy. Internal company documents obtained and reviewed by\nIntelligencer, plus interviews with former staff and students show a company\nselling unprepared students an incomplete education, fueled by overpromising\nmarketing and misleading, if not downright fraudulent, figures.\n\nAllred, a serial entrepreneur from Utah with a background in marketing,\nfounded Lambda in 2017. His previous work was mostly concerned with \u201cgrowth\nhacking,\u201d which is Silicon Valley jargon for finding underappreciated (or,\nless charitably, underhanded) ways of marketing something. He\u2019s also published\nseveral articles about entrepreneurship \u2014 including one with the inauspicious\ntitle \u201cSuccessful Entrepreneurs Are Usually Liars.\u201d\n\n2017 was a bit of an odd time to get into the coding-boot-camp business. The\nindustry got going in 2011, when start-ups were in vogue, and the dominant\neconomic narrative of the day was that high unemployment was explained in part\nby a \u201cskills gap\u201d that retraining could solve. This was the era when people\nwrote articles with titles like \u201cWhy Everyone Should Learn to Code,\u201d and boot\ncamps rushed to fill this apparent need. There was hope that technology could\nsolve its own economic divide between the haves and have-nots \u2014 or rather, the\ncode literate and illiterate.\n\nNearly a decade later, the boot-camp boom is over. Unemployment has dropped,\nand the \u201cskills gap\u201d has come under fire as an explanation for labor-market\nslack, especially now that the labor market has tightened. Most large boot\ncamps have been sold or shut down, as enthusiasm gave way to the sober\neconomics of running a for-profit school. Most, except for Lambda School.\n\nLambda School has raised funding from prestigious Silicon Valley institutions\nlike Y Combinator, GV (formerly Google Ventures), and Ashton Kutcher\u2019s Sound\nVentures. It is currently valued at $150M, an impressive sum for a company\nthat only began fundraising in August of 2017. Unfortunately, there\u2019s very\nlittle evidence that Lambda is able to improve where other boot camps have\nfailed.\n\n## Job Placement\n\nThe point of a coding boot camp, obviously, is to help you get a better job.\nLambda\u2019s claim, reproduced on its website, that \u201c86% of Lambda School\ngraduates are hired within 6 months and make over $50k a year\u201d is an\nunderstandably attractive proposition for students \u2014 and a key pillar of\nLambda\u2019s marketing. Students I talked to confirmed that the feeling that it\nwas likely that they would be able to land high-paying jobs was a key part of\ndeciding to attend.\n\nHowever, a May 2019 Lambda School investment memo \u2014 entitled \u201cHuman Capital:\nThe Last Unoptimized Asset Class\u201d \u2014 written for Y Combinator and obtained by\nIntelligencer, tells a very different story. In a section warning that\nstudent-debt collections may prove too low, it matter-of-factly states that,\n\u201cWe\u2019re at roughly 50% placement for cohorts that are 6 months graduated.\u201d A\nrecent interviewee for work at Lambda School also confirmed to me that the\ncompany\u2019s own internal numbers, which the interviewee was provided as part of\ntheir interview process, seem to indicate a roughly 50 percent or lower\nplacement rate.\n\nSo where does that 86 percent figure come from? Lambda has reported graduate-\noutcome statistics at the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR), a\nvoluntary trade organization of coding boot camps whose purpose is to ensure\nthat participating schools publish truthful information about student\noutcomes. Allred has often used this report to defend his company online. But\nwhere other boot camps have multiple reports spanning many student cohorts,\nLambda has only reported statistics for its first 71 graduates \u2014 86 percent of\nwho, the school claims, found jobs. Sheree Speakman, the CEO of CIRR, told me\nthat Lambda has not undergone the standard independent auditing for the sole\nreport it has submitted, and that her communications to Lambda School\nregarding further reporting and auditing have gone unanswered.\n\nLambda\u2019s former director of career readiness, Sabrina Baez, told me that\nplacing Lambda\u2019s first batch of students was extremely difficult, largely\nowing to how underdeveloped the curriculum was at the time. When asked about\nLambda\u2019s claim that 86 percent of its first graduates were placed within six\nmonths, she told me, \u201cI would say out of that 71 students, within six months\nof them graduating it was probably a 50-60 percent placement rate,\u201d and added\nthat Allred sometimes exaggerated student-placement progress on Twitter \u2014\nrecalling, as an example, an instance in which she told Allred that a student\nmight receive an offer soon, only to find out later that he had tweeted that\nthe student had already received an offer.\n\n## Income Sharing\n\nLambda is also unusual in that it does not charge an upfront tuition to\nattend. Its home page proclaims, \u201cWe don\u2019t get paid until you do, so we\u2019re in\nthis together, from your first day of classes to your first day on the job.\u201d\nLambda School is free, but with an asterisk: To attend, you sign a contract\nthat says that if you get a tech job paying $50K or more, you have to pay 17\npercent of your pre-tax income to Lambda School for two years, or until you\npay back $30K, whichever comes first. These are called Income Share\nAgreements, or ISAs.\n\nStudents I spoke to confirmed that knowing that the school only profited if\nthey were successful in breaking into a tech career was a key factor in\nlearning to trust Lambda. The allure is that you don\u2019t need to trust any\nparticular authority on whether the school is good \u2014 Lambda is putting its\nmoney where its mouth is.\n\nOnly, it\u2019s not always clear to students who actually owns these ISAs. Last\nyear, Lambda partnered with Edly, an ISA marketplace co-founded by former\nMerrill Lynch banker Chris Ricciardi, the \u201cgrandfather of collateralized debt\nobligations,\u201d to sell Lambda ISAs to investors. Wired reported in August 2019\nthat, \u201cFor about half of the ISAs, the company sells the rights to a portion\nof its returns to investors; in return, it gets cash up front.\u201d On Twitter,\nAllred has vociferously denied this claim, suggesting that the author of the\npiece was mistaken. In October, he tweeted, \u201cWe never, ever get paid up front\nfor ISAs.\u201d\n\nPrivate communications to his investors, however, confirm that Allred\u2019s claim\nis entirely untrue. These documents show that, as recently as August 2018, a\nhedge fund paid $10K per ISA to purchase half of Lambda School\u2019s ISAs. In\nfact, Allred lamented not being able to accept a better deal from a second\nfund because the deal with the first fund came with a two-year exclusivity\nagreement. Students I spoke to were entirely unaware of this practice, and\nwere surprised to learn that Lambda was selling their ISAs. This week, the\nVerge reported, Edly began removing references to Lambda on its website. The\nschool\u2019s secret financing arrangements are a violation of Lambda\u2019s central\npromise to its students \u2014 that Lambda only makes money when the students make\nmoney.\n\n## Curriculum Issues\n\nWhat about the quality of education? Lambda\u2019s educational model hinges on\nstudent-contractors called Team Leads (TLs) \u2014 students who, two months into\ntheir education, defer another two months in order to become teaching\nassistants tasked with taking attendance, checking in with other students, and\nanswering questions. These student-contractors are paid roughly $13 an hour\nand have only just learned the material they are then tasked with explaining\nto the next batch of students. One student told me he was given no training on\nhow to be a TL and spent many hours on devising curriculum and exercises to\nhelp other students. Another student, Erica Thompson, told me that TLs \u201care\nhired on a Friday and start on Monday.\u201d\n\nTLs are roughly analogous to graduate-student instructors at universities, but\nwith far less experience with the material. Worse, they\u2019re sometimes tasked\nwith filling in the holes of the start-up\u2019s curriculum development. Two dozen\nTLs were asked to quickly develop a new curriculum to teach React Hooks, a new\naddition to the popular JavaScript library. After the students rushed to\ncomplete this task, it became clear that the instructor who had assigned them\nthe project had acted without approval. Their work was thrown out and quickly\nreplaced with material copied from other online tutorials. This appears to be\na common strategy for Lambda\u2019s curriculum development. Another student\ndescribed material copied from a popular course on Udemy, an online learning\nplatform, handed out on Slack as supplemental material for struggling\nstudents.\n\nThe issues don\u2019t end there. As Zoe Schiffer and Megan Farokhmanesh reported\nthis week at the Verge, the Lambda enrollment process is haphazard and\nunreliable, and the curriculum is unlikely to help students pass even a first-\nround programming interview. For some students, the experience has been so\ndisappointing that they\u2019ve begun to organize. In a group letter to the\nschool\u2019s administration, Bethany Surber, a student spokesperson for a group\nenrolled in Lambda\u2019s UX program, objected to the \u201csubstandard, disorganized,\nor completely lacking curriculum delivered to us by Lambda School.\u201d Surber and\nher group are seeking to negotiate the cancellation of their ISAs.\n\nI had the opportunity to question Allred about all of this at his office this\nJanuary, after an extremely polite PR person ushered me into a small\nconference room in Lambda School\u2019s San Francisco office. When Allred arrived,\nwearing a baseball cap branded with his company\u2019s logo, I asked him about the\ndiscrepancy in the advertised student-placement rate and what he reported to\nhis investors. At first, he told me that the 50 percent number in the memo\nreferred to \u201cstudent[s] making more than $50K.\u201d When I reminded him that his\nmarketing materials claimed that 86 percent of all graduates make at least\nthat much, he admitted that some student cohorts had placement rates as low as\n50 percent, and suggested that because the section of the memo concerned\nrisks, \u201cWe\u2019re going to pick our lowest number.\u201d\n\nI asked about the documents that showed Lambda outright selling ISAs, and he\ntold me \u2014 contra earlier claims on Twitter \u2014 \u201cthat was true in the early days\nof Lambda School, but that\u2019s not true today.\u201d These days, Allred insists, the\nschool doesn\u2019t sell but instead \u201cfinances\u201d ISAs: \u201cWe get an advance from an\ninvestor that is backed by the ISA.\u201d Effectively, Lambda takes out a loan that\nis secured by students\u2019 ISAs, and has to repay that loan with more interest as\nmore students graduate and are placed. Whether or not this counts as \u201cselling\u201d\nstrikes me as a meaningless semantic distinction: Either way, the school\nreceives some money up front and an investor shoulders some of the risk of the\nISA not paying out. And either way, Lambda School students don\u2019t know that the\nschool isn\u2019t as incentive-aligned with them as the school\u2019s marketing\nindicates.\n\nAs for the UX students who organized to try to arrange a cancellation of their\nISAs, Allred suggested that the group\u2019s letter was the result of bullying by\nparticularly vocal complainers. Rather than negotiate with the group as a\nwhole, he told me that he offered to speak with each student individually \u2014\nweakening the group\u2019s bargaining power \u2014 and decide whether their case merited\na cancellation of their ISA. From an original 20 signatories on the letter to\nLambda, 12 students remain who were willing to commit to group bargaining.\n\nBefore I left, I asked Allred about the thing that had first attracted my\nattention about Lambda: Why did he post on Twitter so much? Taking off his\nhat, he told me that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t really have friends,\u201d and used Twitter as a\nway of having some social interaction. A moment later, he clarified that he\nfelt \u201can obligation to do everything I can for the students, in a way that I\njust don\u2019t feel towards friends.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that line. Lambda\u2019s lies regarding graduate outcomes,\nfinancial structure, and curriculum quality are not merely hyperbole to drive\nsales of a product. The real human cost of underprivileged students who have\nbeen sold the dream of a new career is significant. One student I spoke with\nstretched thin the last of the goodwill from his friends and family to be able\nto attend Lambda and forego working. Erica is broke and drives for Uber to\nmake ends meet. Students with no safety nets experience real financial pain\nfrom the nine-month hiatus from work, in addition to the looming dread of\npossibly having to pay Lambda $30K one day.\n\nThere is some virtue, still, to Lambda\u2019s mission. Technology and economic\nchange has opened up new job opportunities, and many Americans are desperate\nto join an industry that promises a future. Coding boot camps offer a kind of\nsolution for one moral conundrum of technology \u2014 can we build a future that\ndoesn\u2019t diminish the people who helped us get here? Not, it would seem,\nthrough Lambda School.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t stopping it. Lambda continues to pursue a familiar grow-at-any-\ncost strategy. Investors now own 40 percent of the company, and Allred now\nneeds to deliver them a return. Lambda\u2019s internal documents show that the\nschool can be profitable so long as at least one in four students manages to\nfind a tech job, and that it intends to enroll more than 10,000 students in\n2020.\n\nThis post has been updated to clarify a hedge fund deal to purchase Lambda\nSchool\u2019s income share agreements.\n\n### Sign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter\n\nDaily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to\nreceive email correspondence from us.\n\n### Tags:\n\n  * technology\n  * learn to code\n  * coding\n  * tech boot camps\n  * lambda school\n  * austen allred\n  * audm\n  * More\n\nShow 19 Comments / 19 New Leave a Comment\n\nThe Misleading Promises of Hot Boot-Camp Startup Lambda\n\nThings you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n### Most Viewed Stories\n\n  1.
