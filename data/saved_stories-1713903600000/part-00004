This is a major step in WorkOS\u2019\nvision to become the world\u2019s best platform for identity, authentication, and\nauthorization.\n\nToday we are thrilled to announce that WorkOS has acquired Warrant, the Fine\nGrained Authorization (FGA) service.\n\nFGA allows developers to implement precise access controls within their\napplications, ensuring robust security and data compliance. In other words, it\ndetermines who has access to what and what they can do within an app.\nWarrant\u2019s product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called\nZanzibar, which was originally designed by Google to power Google Docs and\nYouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while\nmaintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use\ncases.\n\nThe Warrant authorization system is open source, allowing anyone to run it\nthemselves. Developers can alternatively use Warrant\u2019s highly-available cloud\nversion. For the most demanding applications, Warrant provides an \u201cedge-agent\u201d\nservice that enables permission checks to happen entirely locally without a\nnetwork request. This is a key reason why Warrant is the most flexible \u2014 and\ntherefore the most powerful \u2014 authorization solution on the market today.\n\nWarrant was founded 3 years ago and serves millions of requests each day for\ndevelopers around the world. Over the coming months, we plan to integrate\nWarrant\u2019s FGA technology into WorkOS alongside existing products such as\nenterprise Single Sign-On (SAML), Directory Sync (SCIM), User Management\n(CIAM), and Audit Logs (SIEM). If you are currently looking to build Role-\nBased Access Control (RBAC) or Fine Grained Authorization (FGA) in your app,\nplease reach out for access to the preview release.\n\nWe are incredibly excited to join forces with Warrant and continue providing\nthe best platform for identity, authentication, and authorization. We are just\ngetting started!\n\nIn this article\n\nLink\n\nWe\u2019re hiring\n\nOur global team is growing and we\u2019re hiring all types of roles.\n\nView open roles\n\nAbout us\n\nWorkOS builds developer tools for quickly adding enterprise features to\napplications.\n\nLearn more\n\nProducts\n\nUser ManagementEnterprise SSODirectory SyncAdmin PortalAudit LogsAuthKitMulti-\nFactor Auth\n\nDevelopers\n\nDocumentationChangelogOpen SourceAPI Status\n\nResources\n\nBlogPodcastPricingSecuritySupport PlansEnterprise SLA\n\nCompare\n\nAuth0FronteggClerk\n\nCompany\n\nAboutCustomersCareersLegalPrivacyContact\n\n\u00a9 WorkOS, Inc.\n\nThis site uses cookies to improve your experience.
