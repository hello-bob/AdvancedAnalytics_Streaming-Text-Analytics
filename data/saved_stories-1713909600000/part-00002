They are still around, and some of them continue to annoy us\nwith their buzzing. While scientists have classified these creatures as\npterygotes, the rest of the world simply calls them winged insects.\n\nThere are many aspects of insect biology, especially their flight, that remain\na mystery for scientists. One is simply how they move their wings. The insect\nwing hinge is a specialized joint that connects an insect\u2019s wings with its\nbody. It\u2019s composed of five interconnected plate-like structures called\nsclerites. When these plates are shifted by the underlying muscles, it makes\nthe insect wings flap.\n\nUntil now, it has been tricky for scientists to understand the biomechanics\nthat govern the motion of the sclerites even using advanced imaging\ntechnologies. \u201cThe sclerites within the wing hinge are so small and move so\nrapidly that their mechanical operation during flight has not been accurately\ncaptured despite efforts using stroboscopic photography, high-speed\nvideography, and X-ray tomography,\u201d Michael Dickinson, Zarem professor of\nbiology and bioengineering at the California Institute of Technology\n(Caltech), told Ars Technica.\n\nAs a result, scientists are unable to visualize exactly what's going on at the\nmicro-scale within the wing hinge as they fly, preventing them from studying\ninsect flight in detail. However, a new study by Dickinson and his team\nfinally revealed the working of sclerites and the insect wing hinge. They\ncaptured the wing motion of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) analyzing\n72,000 recorded wing beats using a neural network to decode the role\nindividual sclerites played in shaping insect wing motion.\n\n## Understanding the insect wing hinge\n\nThe biomechanics that govern insect flight are quite different from those of\nbirds and bats. This is because wings in insects didn\u2019t evolve from limbs. \u201cIn\nthe case of birds, bats, and pterosaurs we know exactly where the wings came\nfrom evolutionarily because all these animals fly with their forelimbs.\nThey're basically using their arms to fly. In insects, it's a completely\ndifferent story. They evolved from six-legged organisms and they kept all six\nlegs. However, they added flapping appendages to the dorsal side of their\nbody, and it is a mystery as to where those wings came from,\u201d Dickinson\nexplained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome researchers suggest that insect wings came from gill-like appendages\npresent in ancient aquatic arthropods. Others argue that wings originated from\n\u201clobes,\u201d special outgrowths found on the legs of ancient crustaceans, which\nwere ancestors of insects. This debate is still ongoing, so its evolution\ncan\u2019t tell us much about how the hinge and the sclerites operate.\n\nUnderstanding the hinge mechanics is crucial because this is what makes\ninsects efficient flying creatures. It enables them to fly at impressive\nspeeds relative to their body sizes (some insects can fly at 33 mph) and to\ndemonstrate great maneuverability and stability while in flight.\n\n\u201cThe insect wing hinge is arguably among the most sophisticated and\nevolutionarily important skeletal structures in the natural world,\u201d according\nto the study authors.\n\nHowever, imaging the activity of four of the five sclerites that form the\nhinge has been impossible due to their size and the speeds at which they move.\nDickinson and his team employed a multidisciplinary approach to overcome this\nchallenge. They designed an apparatus equipped with three high-speed cameras\nthat recorded the activity of tethered fruit flies at 15,000 frames per second\nusing infrared light.\n\nThey also used a calcium-sensitive protein to track changes in the activity of\nthe steering muscles of the insects as they flew (calcium helps trigger muscle\ncontractions). \u201cWe recorded a total of 485 flight sequences from 82 flies.\nAfter excluding a subset of wingbeats from sequences when the fly either\nstopped flying or flew at an abnormally low wingbeat frequency, we obtained a\nfinal dataset of 72,219 wingbeats,\u201d the researchers note.\n\nNext, they trained a machine-learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN)\nusing 85 percent of the dataset. \u201cWe used the CNN model to investigate the\ntransformation between muscle activity and wing motion by performing a set of\nvirtual manipulations, exploiting the network to execute experiments that\nwould be difficult to perform on actual flies,\u201d they explained.\n\nIn addition to the neural network, they also developed an encoder-decoder\nneural network (an architecture used in machine learning) and fed it data\nrelated to steering muscle activity. While the CNN model could predict wing\nmotion, the encoder/decoder could predict the action of individual sclerite\nmuscles during the movement of the wings. Now, it was time to check whether\nthe data they predicted was accurate.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n29\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### Biomarkers, from diagnosis to treatment\n\nTo find cancer before it strikes, look for the molecular clues\n\n  * ##### Biomarkers, from diagnosis to treatment\n\n  * ##### Scott Manley Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### Teach the Controversy: Dowsing\n\n  * ##### Teach the Conspiracy: GMOs\n\n  * ##### How Does That Work?: Rising sea levels\n\n  * ##### Teach the Controversy: Flat Earthers\n\n  * ##### How Does That Work?: Radiometric Dating\n\n  * ##### How Does That Work?: The Large Hadron Collider\n\n  * ##### What \"First Man\" tells you about Neil Armstrong, and what it doesn't\n\n  * ##### Delta V: The Burgeoning World of Small Rockets, Paul Allen's Huge Plane, and SpaceX Gets a Crucial Green-light\n\n  * ##### Inside the International Space Station with Scott Kelly\n\n  * ##### Chris Hadfield explains his 'Space Oddity' video\n\n  * ##### Astronaut Scott Kelly teaches orbital mechanics with Kerbal Space Program\n\n  * ##### Go Inside the Aerodrome, Where the Future of Flight Takes Shape\n\n  * ##### The soft future of robotics\n\n  * ##### See the Gear the CDC's Disease Detectives Use in the Field\n\n  * ##### Ars Technica interviews Peggy Whitson\n\n  * ##### The Ice Age Secrets of White Sands National Monument\n\n  * ##### InSight Landing On Mars\n\n  * ##### Talking Space and Robots with NASA's Terry Fong\n\nMore videos\n\n\u2190 Previous story Next story \u2192\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Today on Ars\n\nCNMN Collection WIRED Media Group \u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
