However,\nits applicability is limited by its low bandwidth.\n\nIt was covered under the now-expired U.S. patent 5,732,138, titled \"Method for\nseeding a pseudo-random number generator with a cryptographic hash of a\ndigitization of a chaotic system.\" by Landon Curt Noll, Robert G. Mende, and\nSanjeev Sisodiya.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2001,^[2] there was a website at lavarand.sgi.com demonstrating\nthe technique. Landon Curt Noll, one of the process's originators, went on to\nhelp develop LavaRnd, which does not use lava lamps.^[3] Despite the short\nlife of lavarand.sgi.com, it is often cited as an example of an online random\nnumber source.^[4]^[5]\n\nAs of 2017^[update], Cloudflare maintains a similar system of lava lamps for\nsecuring Internet traffic.^[6]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Totally Random\".
