TechSpot means tech analysis and\nadvice you can trust.\n\nWhy it matters: Zilog is retiring the Z80 after 48 years on the market.\nOriginally developed as a project stemming from the Intel 8080, it eventually\nrose to become one of the most popular and widely used 8-bit CPUs in both\ngaming and general computing devices.\n\nThe iconic IC device, developed by Federico Faggin, will soon be phased out,\nand interested parties only have a few months left to place their orders\nbefore Zilog's manufacturing partner ends support for the technology.\n\nAccording to Zilog's notification, Wafer Foundry Manufacturer (WFM) will cease\naccepting \"last time buy\" (LTB) orders for the remaining Z80 products in mid-\nJune. Zilog will process and schedule LTB orders for the Z80 based on\ncustomers' demand, while WFM will provide actual delivery dates thereafter.\nDepending on the overall LTB demand, the company may impose stricter\nrequirements on minimum and maximum quantities.\n\nFederico Faggin, an Intel engineer, founded Zilog in 1974 after his work on\nthe Intel 4004, the first 4-bit CPU. The Zilog Z80 was then released in July\n1976, conceived as a software-compatible \"extension\" and enhancement of the\nIntel 8080 processor.\n\nDeveloped by a team of just 12 people, the Z80 saw remarkable success, leading\nZilog to establish its own chip manufacturing plants and expand to over a\nthousand employees within two years. Like its Intel counterpart, the Z80 was\noriginally designed for embedded systems but went on to become a significant\nmilestone in gaming hardware from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.\n\n> The Zilog Z80 is discontinued. pic.twitter.com/oCxVyl7IhT\n>\n> \u2013 \u00e3\u00c2\u00c2\u00e3\u00c2\u00c2\u00e3\u00c2\u00a6\u00e3\u00c2\u00c2 @ \u00e8\u00c2a\u00e5\u00b7\u00b1\u00e3\u00c2\u00ae\u00e6\u00bb (@iyatemu) April 19, 2024\n\nSeveral home computers and gaming consoles were built around the capabilities\nof the Z80, including Sega's Master System and SG-1000, and Nintendo's Game\nBoy and Game Boy Color. Many classic arcade games also used the Z80, including\nthe original version of Pac-Man. Additionally, the 8-bit processor was common\nin military applications, musical synthesizers like the Roland Jupiter-8, and\nvarious other electronic devices.\n\nZilog licensed its Z80 technology to US companies Synertek and Mostek, which\naided Faggin's venture with production, as well as to the European\nmanufacturer SGS/STMicroelectronics. The CPU design was later replicated by\nJapanese, East European, and Soviet manufacturers, while corporations such as\nNEC, Toshiba, Sharp, and Hitachi produced their own compatible versions of the\nchip.\n\nIn recent years, Zilog has refocused Z80 production on the embedded device\nmarket, offering advanced microcontroller products that retain compatibility\nwith the original Z80 and Z180 designs.\n\n10 comments 736 likes and shares\n\nShare this article:\n\n### Tech Jobs: Find the next step in your career\n\n### Related Stories\n\n  * AMD unveils new Ryzen Pro 8000 processors for AI PCs\n  * Meta Quest 2 gets a permanent price drop to just $199\n  * Intel Lunar Lake to offer 45 TOPS of NPU performance, matching Microsoft's \"AI PC\" threshold\n  * Microsoft Xbox credit card is out of beta, available to all US residents\n\n### Featured on TechSpot\n\n  * San Francisco's train system still runs on floppy disks\n\n  * China bans Intel and AMD CPUs, Windows for government PCs\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * 25 comments\n\nNew charging algorithm could double life of li-ion batteries\n\n  * 39 comments\n\nRepair shop reports receiving 200 melted RTX 4090s per month, up from last\nyear\n\n  * 33 comments\n\nNew Affordable AMD B650 Motherboard Roundup\n\n  * 14 comments\n\nThe DiskMantler can take apart a hard drive in as little as 8 seconds by\nvigorously shaking it\n\nLoad Comments 10\n\n...\n\nUser Comments: 10\n\nGot something to say?
