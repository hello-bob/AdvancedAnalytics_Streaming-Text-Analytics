This has been\nconfirmed by Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Dr.\nWilliam LaPlante. While many questions remain about the tablet and how it\nexactly works, there\u2019s now footage showing it fitted in cockpits during combat\n(or at least live-fire training) missions.\n\nLaPlante was speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\n(CSIS) think tank's annual Global Security Forum yesterday, April 24, 2024.\nWhen asked to provide examples of successful programs that rapidly developed\ncapabilities and got them into the hands of the military, one example he chose\nwas the tablets in Ukrainian fighter cockpits:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a series of ... we call it \u2018air-to-ground,\u2019 it\u2019s what we call it\neuphemistically ... think about the aircraft that the Ukrainians have, and not\neven the F-16s, but they have a lot of the Russian and Soviet-era aircraft.\nWorking with the Ukrainians, we\u2019ve been able to take many Western weapons and\nget them to work on their aircraft where it\u2019s basically controlled by an iPad\nby the pilot. And they\u2019re flying it in conflict like a week after we get it to\nhim.\u201d\n\nLaPlante didn\u2019t provide further details, but it\u2019s noteworthy that a video\nrecently released by the Ukrainian Air Force shows a Su-27 Flanker fitted with\nexactly this type of system \u2014 possibly an iPad, but perhaps also another kind\nof commercially available tablet.\n\nThe video in question shows the Su-27 employing U.S.-supplied AGM-88 High-\nspeed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARMs), which have provided these fighters, as\nwell as Ukrainian MiG-29 Fulcrums with a suppression and destruction of enemy\nair defense (SEAD/DEAD) capability.\n\nIn one portion of the video, screen-capped below, the tablet can be seen to\ndisplay a navigational map, as well as other, undiscernible data.\n\nvia X\n\nThe fact that the size of the tablet, attached horizontally, blocks out key\ninstruments in the cockpit suggests that it displays a variety of flight-\ncritical data, as well as being used for navigation.\n\nvia X\n\nBased on LaPlante\u2019s remarks, it seems that the same tablet is also vital for\nthe employment of several Western-supplied air-to-ground weapons. After HARM\nwas integrated, Soviet-era Ukrainian fighters also began using Joint Direct\nAttack Munition-Extended Range (JDAM-ER) precision-guided bombs. They have\nsince added French-supplied Hammer rocket-assisted bombs to their inventory\nlists. The United Kingdom has now also pledged to send dual-mode Paveway IV\nprecision-guided bombs, though it is unknown at present what aircraft will\ncarry them.\n\nIn the case of HARM, JDAM-ER, and Hammer, it has been assumed that they are\nlikely being employed against targets of known coordinates, with these being\npre-programmed on the flight line before the jet takes off. The pilot then has\nto navigate to the area, perhaps also aided by a tablet with GPS navigation,\nand then release the weapon, which is guided to the target using its GPS-aided\ninertial navigation system.\n\nUsing HARM is a little more involved, however, due to the fact that the target\nmight present itself only fleetingly and may well be highly mobile (especially\nin the case of battlefield air defense systems). At the same time, the nature\nof the SEAD/DEAD means that the pilot may need to respond to \u2018pop-up\u2019 targets\nas and when they appear, for example when a particular air defense radar is\nswitched on.\n\nA Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker carrying AGM-88 HARM missiles as well as air-to-air\nmissiles. via X via Twitter\n\nMost critically, however, in the case of Ukraine, is the fact that its Soviet-\nera fighters lack the kinds of data bus interfaces that would ensure seamless\ncompatibility with any of these three weapons.\n\nThis is something we have discussed in the past and we also concluded that a\ntablet was a likely part of the solution.\n\nFurthermore, an Su-27 or MiG-29 using JDAM-ER relies not only on a tablet in\nthe cockpit, but also on specialized pylons on which the weapons are carried.\nAs we have noted in the past, these unusual pylons may not only provide\ncritical GPS information to the weapon prior to release, but they could also\nincorporate some kind of electronic support measures (ESM) \u2014 passive detection\ngear that can identify and even geolocate threat emitters.\n\nProbably the best look so far at the distinctive pylon that Ukrainian MiG-29\nand Su-27 fighters use to carry JDAM-ER precision-guided glide bombs. via X\nvia X\n\nWhile one ESM receiver in the pylon (or elsewhere on the jet, for that matter)\nwould be able to provide general awareness of a radar threat's presence, it\nwouldn\u2019t be able to determine its range. However, two or more such receivers\ncould allow that same emitter to be triangulated. This would allow the\nlocation to be determined, which could, in turn, be presented on the map shown\non the cockpit tablet.\n\nThe pilot would then be much better able to use JDAM-ER to prosecute targets\nof opportunity. The same may well apply to the Hammer, which appears to be\nlaunched from these same pylons.\n\nAn underside view of a Ukrainian MiG-29 carrying a Hammer munition, also seen\nin the inset top right. via X/Sagem Via X\n\nHARM, on the other hand, has not been seen fitted to the special pylons.\n\nNevertheless, a cockpit tablet could provide a kind of visualized radar\nwarning receiver for Ukrainian fighter pilots conducting Wild Weasel missions.\nIt could present data acquired by some other kind of onboard ESM, or more\nrudimentary information from the seeker head on the HARMs themselves. In this\nway, threat data could overlayed on a map, with the pilot then using this to\nprosecute those targets or otherwise avoid the highest-threat areas. Any of\nthis kind of capability would enhance the survivability of the jets and the\nefficacy of the air-to-ground weapons they launch.\n\nAt the very least, the tablet could allow for basic weapons employment,\ntogether with the GPS-generated moving map.\n\nAn AGM-88 HARM loaded on a MiG-29, seen here in a screen capture from a video\npreviously released by a Ukrainian organization called RevengeFor. RevengeFor\ncapture via X\n\nIt should be noted that we have seen previous imagery of smaller, commercially\navailable GPS devices \u2014 apparently from Garmin \u2014 installed in the cockpits of\nUkrainian MiG-29s, as in the video below, which also includes HARM-shooting\nFulcrums.\n\nIt is even possible that such a setup, with a pylon adapted for the weapons\nbeing employed and paired with a tablet, would not need any data bus wiring at\nall. The pylon could contain a hardware module that handles this with some\nsort of a short-range wireless device, like a Bluetooth system, that connects\nwith the pad in the cockpit wireless. While this may be far from a traditional\nmilitary-grade solution, it would make integration seamless without having to\nwire the aircraft specifically for these new munitions.\n\nSo, while still much is unknown about exactly how these tablets interface with\nthe aircraft and the Western weapons they now carry, it's clear that they play\na major role in giving Ukraine's old Soviet-era fighters a bunch of new and\nvery deadly tricks.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com\n\nAGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM)Air Force MunitionsAir\nForcesAir-To-GroundFightersFlankersFulcrumsJoint Direct Attack Munition\n(JDAM)MiG-29Su-27Ukrainian Air Force\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
