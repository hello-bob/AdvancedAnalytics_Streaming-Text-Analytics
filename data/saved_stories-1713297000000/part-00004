It's the decade of the 2040s that we're\ngonna be landing astronauts on Mars.\"\n\nAn artist's impression of the Mars Sample Return Mission on the surface of the\nred planet, showing the Perseverance rover already exploring Jezero crater, a\nsmall helicopter and a lander featuring a robot arm to collect the rover's\nsamples and put them in a containing aboard a solid-propellant rocket. The\nrocket then would blast off and release the sample container in Mars orbit\nwhere a European Space Agency spacecraft would capture it and bring the\nsamples back to Earth for analysis. NASA\n\nHe said the estimated price tag, which could go up to $11 billion depending on\nthe options pursued, also was \"unacceptable.\" The original target in a\nNational Science Foundation decadal survey that recommended a sample return\nmission was just under $6 billion.\n\n\"The long and short of it then is that the current budget environment doesn't\nallow us to pursue an $11 billion architecture, and 2040 is too long,\" Nelson\nsaid. \"So, what to do?\n\n\"I have asked our folks to reach out with a request for information to\nindustry, to JPL, to all NASA centers (and) to report back this fall an\nalternate plan that would get (samples) back quicker and cheaper, and try to\nstay within those limits that the decadal survey said that we should.\"\n\nAfter the teleconference concluded, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said on X that\nhis company's Starship rocket, which NASA Artemis astronauts will use to reach\nthe moon's surface in the next few years, \"has the potential to return serious\ntonnage from Mars within (about) 5 years.\"\n\n> Starship has the potential to return serious tonnage from Mars within ~5\n> years\n>\n> \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 15, 2024\n\nNo immediate comment on that idea from NASA.\n\nAs originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, is the most\ncomplex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new\nNASA lander to bring a rocket to the surface capable of launching soil and\nrock samples gathered by another rover already on the red planet.\n\nOnce in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by a European\nSpace Agency spacecraft and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis\nto determine if any signs of past microbial activity might be present in\nancient riverbed deposits.\n\nThe Perseverance rover captured a selfie last year showing the robot in Jezero\ncrater on the red planet where it is collecting soil and rock samples for\neventual return to Earth by NASA's Mars Sample Return mission. NASA\n\nNASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, with a projected life cycle\ncost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent\nreview board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget\nprojections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up\nto the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.\n\nThe review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the\nground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion\ndepending on the final mission architecture.\n\n\"MSR is a deep-space exploration priority for NASA, in collaboration with\nESA,\" the review team concluded. \"However, MSR was established with\nunrealistic budget and schedule expectations from the beginning. MSR was also\norganized under an unwieldy structure.\n\n\"As a result, there is currently no credible, congruent technical, nor\nproperly margined schedule, cost and technical baseline that can be\naccomplished with the likely available funding.\"\n\nThe team said \"technical issues, risks and performance-to-date indicate a near\nzero probability of ... meeting the 2027/2028 Launch Readiness Dates (LRDs).\nPotential LRDs exist in 2030, given adequate funding and timely resolution of\nissues.\"\n\nTo launch in 2030, the NASA sample retrieval lander and ESA's Earth Return\nOrbiter likely will requite between $8 billion and $9.6 billion, \"with funding\nin excess of $1 (billion) per year to be required for three or more years\nstarting in 2025.\"\n\nA sealed sample tube rests on the surface of Mars after release from the\nPerseverance rover. The precise locations of the sample tubes is documented to\nmake recovery by a sample return mission more efficient. NASA\n\nAlternative mission scenarios and launching the sample retrieval rover and ESA\norbiter on different timetables between 2030 and 2035 might \"yield an MSR\nprogram that is potentially able to fit within the likely annual funding\nconstraints.\" But costs could reach nearly $11 billion, more than NASA spent\nto build the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nNelson said a major reason for the ballooning cost was a billion-dollar hit to\nNASA's science budget that was part of a congressional deal to secure funding\nfor the debt ceiling. NASA received $310 million for the sample return mission\nin the agency's fiscal 2024 budget and plans to ask for just $200 million in\nthe FY25 budget request while mission options are explored.\n\nHowever the mission plays out, samples will be waiting. Since landing in\nJezero crater in February 2021, NASA's Perseverance rover has been collecting\nsoil and rock samples, storing them on board in sealed tubes or dropping them\nto the surface in known locations for eventual retrieval. The samples were\ncollected at or near an ancient delta where water once flowed into the crater,\npossibly depositing indicators of past biological activity.\n\nWhile Perseverance is equipped with sophisticated instruments and lab gear, it\nwas designed primarily to assess habitability, not to look for direct signs of\npast microbial life. For that sort of in-depth research, the samples must be\nbrought back to Earth.\n\nUnder the initial MSR plan, a NASA retrieval rover would touch down near the\nPerseverance samples, collect them with a robot arm or small helicopters and\nput them inside a sample container atop a solid-fuel rocket known as the Mars\nAscent Vehicle. The MAV would then blast off and release the sample container\nin Mars orbit.\n\nAt that point, ESA's retrieval spacecraft would rendezvous with the sample\nspacecraft, capture it and head back to Earth. The sample container then would\nbe released for a parachute descent to a U.S. landing site. From there, it\nwould be flown to a laboratory at the Johnson Space Center for the start of\ndetailed analysis.\n\n### Space & Astronomy\n\nMore\n\nObject that crashed through Florida home's roof was from space station\n\nNASA seeks to reign in costs of Mars Sample Return mission\n\nFinal Delta 4 Heavy puts NRO spy satellite into space\n\nSpace station captures image of moon's shadow during solar eclipse\n\nBill Nye shares tips for eclipse: \"Be in the moment\"\n\nMore\n\nIn:\n\n  * Perseverance Mars rover\n  * Mars\n  * Space\n  * NASA\n\nWilliam Harwood\n\nBill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984,\nfirst as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as\na consultant for CBS News.\n\nTwitter\n\nFirst published on April 15, 2024 / 3:30 PM EDT\n\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.
