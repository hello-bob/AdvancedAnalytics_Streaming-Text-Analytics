Feature requests and bug reports are always welcome!\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\njust should run on any system with a reasonable sh, including Linux, MacOS,\nand the BSDs.\n\nOn Windows, just works with the sh provided by Git for Windows, GitHub\nDesktop, or Cygwin.\n\nIf you'd rather not install sh, you can use the shell setting to use the shell\nof your choice.\n\nLike PowerShell:\n\n    \n    \n    # use PowerShell instead of sh: set shell := [\"powershell.exe\", \"-c\"] hello: Write-Host \"Hello, world!\"\n\n...or cmd.exe:\n\n    \n    \n    # use cmd.exe instead of sh: set shell := [\"cmd.exe\", \"/c\"] list: dir\n\nYou can also set the shell using command-line arguments. For example, to use\nPowerShell, launch just with --shell powershell.exe --shell-arg -c.\n\n(PowerShell is installed by default on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008\nR2 S1 and later, and cmd.exe is quite fiddly, so PowerShell is recommended for\nmost Windows users.)\n\n### Packages\n\nOperating System| Package Manager| Package| Command  \n---|---|---|---  \nAlpine Linux| apk-tools| just| apk add just  \nArch Linux| pacman| just| pacman -S just  \nDebian and Ubuntu derivatives| MPR| just| git clone\nhttps://mpr.makedeb.org/just cd just makedeb -si  \nDebian and Ubuntu derivatives| Prebuilt-MPR| just| ^You must have the\nPrebuilt-MPR set up on your system in order to run this command. sudo apt\ninstall just  \nFedora Linux| DNF| just| dnf install just  \nFreeBSD| pkg| just| pkg install just  \nGentoo Linux| Portage| guru/dev-build/just| eselect repository enable guru\nemerge --sync guru emerge dev-build/just  \nmacOS| MacPorts| just| port install just  \nMicrosoft Windows| Chocolatey| just| choco install just  \nMicrosoft Windows| Scoop| just| scoop install just  \nMicrosoft Windows| Windows Package Manager| Casey/Just| winget install --id\nCasey.Just --exact  \nNixOS| Nix| just| nix-env -iA nixos.just  \nopenSUSE| Zypper| just| zypper in just  \nSolus| eopkg| just| eopkg install just  \nVarious| asdf| just| asdf plugin add just asdf install just <version>  \nVarious| Cargo| just| cargo install just  \nVarious| Conda| just| conda install -c conda-forge just  \nVarious| Homebrew| just| brew install just  \nVarious| Nix| just| nix-env -iA nixpkgs.just  \nVarious| Snap| just| snap install --edge --classic just  \nVoid Linux| XBPS| just| xbps-install -S just  \n  \n### Pre-Built Binaries\n\nPre-built binaries for Linux, MacOS, and Windows can be found on the releases\npage.\n\nYou can use the following command on Linux, MacOS, or Windows to download the\nlatest release, just replace DEST with the directory where you'd like to put\njust:\n\n    \n    \n    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to DEST\n\nFor example, to install just to ~/bin:\n\n    \n    \n    # create ~/bin mkdir -p ~/bin # download and extract just to ~/bin/just curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/bin # add `~/bin` to the paths that your shell searches for executables # this line should be added to your shells initialization file, # e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/bin\" # just should now be executable just --help\n\nNote that install.sh may fail on GitHub Actions, or in other environments\nwhere many machines share IP addresses. install.sh calls GitHub APIs in order\nto determine the latest version of just to install, and those API calls are\nrate-limited on a per-IP basis. To make install.sh more reliable in such\ncircumstances, pass a specific tag to install with --tag.\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\nDevelopers may be interested in running the same just commands that they use\nlocally on continuous integration platforms such as GitHub Actions. For\nexample, every time that a contributor creates a pull request, a GitHub Action\ncould run just test on the three major operating systems to provide feedback\nto both the contributor and reviewers that tests are passing.\n\nDemonstrate how to install and use just in GitHub Actions on the three major\noperating systems without needing third-party GitHub Actions. Put the\nfollowing code into a .github/workflows/just_test.yml file.\n\n    \n    \n    name: just_test on: [pull_request, push] jobs: ubuntu: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - run: sudo snap install --edge --classic just - uses: actions/checkout@v4 - run: just test macos: runs-on: macos-latest steps: - run: brew install just - uses: actions/checkout@v4 - run: just test windows: runs-on: windows-latest steps: - run: choco install just - uses: actions/checkout@v4 - run: just test\n\nOr with extractions/setup-just:\n\n    \n    \n    - uses: extractions/setup-just@v1 with: just-version: 1.5.0 # optional semver specification, otherwise latest\n\nOr with taiki-e/install-action:\n\n    \n    \n    - uses: taiki-e/install-action@just\n\n### Release RSS Feed\n\nAn RSS feed of just releases is available here.\n\n### Node.js Installation\n\njust-install can be used to automate installation of just in Node.js\napplications.\n\njust is a great, more robust alternative to npm scripts. If you want to\ninclude just in the dependencies of a Node.js application, just-install will\ninstall a local, platform-specific binary as part of the npm install command.\nThis removes the need for every developer to install just independently using\none of the processes mentioned above. After installation, the just command\nwill work in npm scripts or with npx. It's great for teams who want to make\nthe set up process for their project as easy as possible.\n\nFor more information, see the just-install README file.\n\n## Backwards Compatibility\n\nWith the release of version 1.0, just features a strong commitment to\nbackwards compatibility and stability.\n\nFuture releases will not introduce backwards incompatible changes that make\nexisting justfiles stop working, or break working invocations of the command-\nline interface.\n\nThis does not, however, preclude fixing outright bugs, even if doing so might\nbreak justfiles that rely on their behavior.\n\nThere will never be a just 2.0. Any desirable backwards-incompatible changes\nwill be opt-in on a per-justfile basis, so users may migrate at their leisure.\n\nFeatures that aren't yet ready for stabilization are gated behind the\n--unstable flag. Features enabled by --unstable may change in backwards\nincompatible ways at any time. Unstable features can also be enabled by\nsetting the environment variable JUST_UNSTABLE to any value other than false,\n0, or the empty string.\n\n## Editor Support\n\njustfile syntax is close enough to make that you may want to tell your editor\nto use make syntax highlighting for just.\n\n### Vim and Neovim\n\n#### vim-just\n\nThe vim-just plugin provides syntax highlighting for justfiles.\n\nInstall it with your favorite package manager, like Plug:\n\n    \n    \n    call plug#begin() Plug 'NoahTheDuke/vim-just' call plug#end()\n\nOr with Vim's built-in package support:\n\n    \n    \n    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start cd ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start git clone https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just.git\n\n#### tree-sitter-just\n\ntree-sitter-just is an Nvim Treesitter plugin for Neovim.\n\n#### Makefile Syntax Highlighting\n\nVim's built-in makefile syntax highlighting isn't perfect for justfiles, but\nit's better than nothing. You can put the following in ~/.vim/filetype.vim:\n\n    \n    \n    if exists(\"did_load_filetypes\") finish endif augroup filetypedetect au BufNewFile,BufRead justfile setf make augroup END\n\nOr add the following to an individual justfile to enable make mode on a per-\nfile basis:\n\n    \n    \n    # vim: set ft=make :\n\n### Emacs\n\njust-mode provides syntax highlighting and automatic indentation of justfiles.\nIt is available on MELPA as just-mode.\n\njustl provides commands for executing and listing recipes.\n\nYou can add the following to an individual justfile to enable make mode on a\nper-file basis:\n\n    \n    \n    # Local Variables: # mode: makefile # End:\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n\nAn extension for VS Code by skellock is available here (repository), but is no\nlonger actively developed.\n\nYou can install it from the command line by running:\n\n    \n    \n    code --install-extension skellock.just\n\nAn more recently active fork by sclu1034 is available here.\n\n### JetBrains IDEs\n\nA plugin for JetBrains IDEs by linux_china is available here.\n\n### Kakoune\n\nKakoune supports justfile syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to\nTeddyDD.\n\n### Helix\n\nHelix supports justfile syntax highlighting out-of-the-box since version\n23.05.\n\n### Sublime Text\n\nThe Just package by nk9 with just syntax and some other tools is available on\nPackageControl.\n\n### Micro\n\nMicro supports Justfile syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to\ntomodachi94.\n\n### Other Editors\n\nFeel free to send me the commands necessary to get syntax highlighting working\nin your editor of choice so that I may include them here.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nSee the installation section for how to install just on your computer. Try\nrunning just --version to make sure that it's installed correctly.\n\nFor an overview of the syntax, check out this cheatsheet.\n\nOnce just is installed and working, create a file named justfile in the root\nof your project with the following contents:\n\n    \n    \n    recipe-name: echo 'This is a recipe!' # this is a comment another-recipe: @echo 'This is another recipe.'\n\nWhen you invoke just it looks for file justfile in the current directory and\nupwards, so you can invoke it from any subdirectory of your project.\n\nThe search for a justfile is case insensitive, so any case, like Justfile,\nJUSTFILE, or JuStFiLe, will work. just will also look for files with the name\n.justfile, in case you'd like to hide a justfile.\n\nRunning just with no arguments runs the first recipe in the justfile:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just echo 'This is a recipe!' This is a recipe!\n\nOne or more arguments specify the recipe(s) to run:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just another-recipe This is another recipe.\n\njust prints each command to standard error before running it, which is why\necho 'This is a recipe!' was printed. This is suppressed for lines starting\nwith @, which is why echo 'This is another recipe.' was not printed.\n\nRecipes stop running if a command fails. Here cargo publish will only run if\ncargo test succeeds:\n\n    \n    \n    publish: cargo test # tests passed, time to publish! cargo publish\n\nRecipes can depend on other recipes. Here the test recipe depends on the build\nrecipe, so build will run before test:\n\n    \n    \n    build: cc main.c foo.c bar.c -o main test: build ./test sloc: @echo \"`wc -l *.c` lines of code\"\n    \n    \n    $ just test cc main.c foo.c bar.c -o main ./test testing... all tests passed!\n\nRecipes without dependencies will run in the order they're given on the\ncommand line:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just build sloc cc main.c foo.c bar.c -o main 1337 lines of code\n\nDependencies will always run first, even if they are passed after a recipe\nthat depends on them:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just test build cc main.c foo.c bar.c -o main ./test testing... all tests passed!\n\n## Examples\n\nA variety of example justfiles can be found in the examples directory.\n\n## Features\n\n### The Default Recipe\n\nWhen just is invoked without a recipe, it runs the first recipe in the\njustfile. This recipe might be the most frequently run command in the project,\nlike running the tests:\n\n    \n    \n    test: cargo test\n\nYou can also use dependencies to run multiple recipes by default:\n\n    \n    \n    default: lint build test build: echo Building... test: echo Testing... lint: echo Linting...\n\nIf no recipe makes sense as the default recipe, you can add a recipe to the\nbeginning of your justfile that lists the available recipes:\n\n    \n    \n    default: just --list\n\n### Listing Available Recipes\n\nRecipes can be listed in alphabetical order with just --list:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --list Available recipes: build test deploy lint\n\njust --summary is more concise:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --summary build test deploy lint\n\nPass --unsorted to print recipes in the order they appear in the justfile:\n\n    \n    \n    test: echo 'Testing!' build: echo 'Building!'\n    \n    \n    $ just --list --unsorted Available recipes: test build\n    \n    \n    $ just --summary --unsorted test build\n\nIf you'd like just to default to listing the recipes in the justfile, you can\nuse this as your default recipe:\n\n    \n    \n    default: @just --list\n\nNote that you may need to add --justfile {{justfile()}} to the line above.\nWithout it, if you executed just -f /some/distant/justfile -d . or just -f\n./non-standard-justfile, the plain just --list inside the recipe would not\nnecessarily use the file you provided. It would try to find a justfile in your\ncurrent path, maybe even resulting in a No justfile found error.\n\nThe heading text can be customized with --list-heading:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --list --list-heading $'Cool stuff...\\n' Cool stuff... test build\n\nAnd the indentation can be customized with --list-prefix:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --list --list-prefix \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Available recipes: \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7test \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7build\n\nThe argument to --list-heading replaces both the heading and the newline\nfollowing it, so it should contain a newline if non-empty. It works this way\nso you can suppress the heading line entirely by passing the empty string:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --list --list-heading '' test build\n\n### Aliases\n\nAliases allow recipes to be invoked on the command line with alternative\nnames:\n\n    \n    \n    alias b := build build: echo 'Building!'\n    \n    \n    $ just b echo 'Building!' Building!\n\n### Settings\n\nSettings control interpretation and execution. Each setting may be specified\nat most once, anywhere in the justfile.\n\nFor example:\n\n    \n    \n    set shell := [\"zsh\", \"-cu\"] foo: # this line will be run as `zsh -cu 'ls **/*.txt'` ls **/*.txt\n\n#### Table of Settings\n\nName| Value| Default| Description  \n---|---|---|---  \nallow-duplicate-recipes| boolean| false| Allow recipes appearing later in a\njustfile to override earlier recipes with the same name.  \ndotenv-filename| string| -| Load a .env file with a custom name, if present.  \ndotenv-load| boolean| false| Load a .env file, if present.  \ndotenv-path| string| -| Load a .env file from a custom path, if present.\nOverrides dotenv-filename.  \nexport| boolean| false| Export all variables as environment variables.  \nfallback| boolean| false| Search justfile in parent directory if the first\nrecipe on the command line is not found.  \nignore-comments| boolean| false| Ignore recipe lines beginning with #.  \npositional-arguments| boolean| false| Pass positional arguments.  \nshell| [COMMAND, ARGS...]| -| Set the command used to invoke recipes and\nevaluate backticks.  \ntempdir| string| -| Create temporary directories in tempdir instead of the\nsystem default temporary directory.  \nwindows-powershell| boolean| false| Use PowerShell on Windows as default\nshell. (Deprecated. Use windows-shell instead.  \nwindows-shell| [COMMAND, ARGS...]| -| Set the command used to invoke recipes\nand evaluate backticks.  \n  \nBoolean settings can be written as:\n\n    \n    \n    set NAME\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n    \n    \n    set NAME := true\n\n#### Allow Duplicate Recipes\n\nIf allow-duplicate-recipes is set to true, defining multiple recipes with the\nsame name is not an error and the last definition is used. Defaults to false.\n\n    \n    \n    set allow-duplicate-recipes @foo: echo foo @foo: echo bar\n    \n    \n    $ just foo bar\n\n#### Dotenv Settings\n\nIf dotenv-load, dotenv-filename or dotenv-path is set, just will load\nenvironment variables from a file.\n\nIf dotenv-path is set, just will look for a file at the given path.\n\nOtherwise, just looks for a file named .env by default, unless dotenv-filename\nset, in which case the value of dotenv-filename is used. This file can be\nlocated in the same directory as your justfile or in a parent directory.\n\nThe loaded variables are environment variables, not just variables, and so\nmust be accessed using $VARIABLE_NAME in recipes and backticks.\n\nFor example, if your .env file contains:\n\n    \n    \n    # a comment, will be ignored DATABASE_ADDRESS=localhost:6379 SERVER_PORT=1337\n\nAnd your justfile contains:\n\n    \n    \n    set dotenv-load serve: @echo \"Starting server with database $DATABASE_ADDRESS on port $SERVER_PORT...\" ./server --database $DATABASE_ADDRESS --port $SERVER_PORT\n\njust serve will output:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just serve Starting server with database localhost:6379 on port 1337... ./server --database $DATABASE_ADDRESS --port $SERVER_PORT\n\n#### Export\n\nThe export setting causes all just variables to be exported as environment\nvariables. Defaults to false.\n\n    \n    \n    set export a := \"hello\" @foo b: echo $a echo $b\n    \n    \n    $ just foo goodbye hello goodbye\n\n#### Positional Arguments\n\nIf positional-arguments is true, recipe arguments will be passed as positional\narguments to commands. For linewise recipes, argument $0 will be the name of\nthe recipe.\n\nFor example, running this recipe:\n\n    \n    \n    set positional-arguments @foo bar: echo $0 echo $1\n\nWill produce the following output:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just foo hello foo hello\n\nWhen using an sh-compatible shell, such as bash or zsh, $@ expands to the\npositional arguments given to the recipe, starting from one. When used within\ndouble quotes as \"$@\", arguments including whitespace will be passed on as if\nthey were double-quoted. That is, \"$@\" is equivalent to \"$1\" \"$2\"... When\nthere are no positional parameters, \"$@\" and $@ expand to nothing (i.e., they\nare removed).\n\nThis example recipe will print arguments one by one on separate lines:\n\n    \n    \n    set positional-arguments @test *args='': bash -c 'while (( \"$#\" )); do echo - $1; shift; done' -- \"$@\"\n\nRunning it with two arguments:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just test foo \"bar baz\" - foo - bar baz\n\n#### Shell\n\nThe shell setting controls the command used to invoke recipe lines and\nbackticks. Shebang recipes are unaffected.\n\n    \n    \n    # use python3 to execute recipe lines and backticks set shell := [\"python3\", \"-c\"] # use print to capture result of evaluation foos := `print(\"foo\" * 4)` foo: print(\"Snake snake snake snake.\") print(\"{{foos}}\")\n\njust passes the command to be executed as an argument. Many shells will need\nan additional flag, often -c, to make them evaluate the first argument.\n\n##### Windows Shell\n\njust uses sh on Windows by default. To use a different shell on Windows, use\nwindows-shell:\n\n    \n    \n    set windows-shell := [\"powershell.exe\", \"-NoLogo\", \"-Command\"] hello: Write-Host \"Hello, world!\"\n\nSee powershell.just for a justfile that uses PowerShell on all platforms.\n\n##### Windows PowerShell\n\nset windows-powershell uses the legacy powershell.exe binary, and is no longer\nrecommended. See the windows-shell setting above for a more flexible way to\ncontrol which shell is used on Windows.\n\njust uses sh on Windows by default. To use powershell.exe instead, set\nwindows-powershell to true.\n\n    \n    \n    set windows-powershell := true hello: Write-Host \"Hello, world!\"\n\n##### Python 3\n\n    \n    \n    set shell := [\"python3\", \"-c\"]\n\n##### Bash\n\n    \n    \n    set shell := [\"bash\", \"-uc\"]\n\n##### Z Shell\n\n    \n    \n    set shell := [\"zsh\", \"-uc\"]\n\n##### Fish\n\n    \n    \n    set shell := [\"fish\", \"-c\"]\n\n##### Nushell\n\n    \n    \n    set shell := [\"nu\", \"-c\"]\n\nIf you want to change the default table mode to light:\n\n    \n    \n    set shell := ['nu', '-m', 'light', '-c']\n\nNushell was written in Rust, and has cross-platform support for Windows /\nmacOS and Linux.\n\n### Documentation Comments\n\nComments immediately preceding a recipe will appear in just --list:\n\n    \n    \n    # build stuff build: ./bin/build # test stuff test: ./bin/test\n    \n    \n    $ just --list Available recipes: build # build stuff test # test stuff\n\n### Variables and Substitution\n\nVariables, strings, concatenation, path joining, and substitution using\n{{...}} are supported:\n\n    \n    \n    tmpdir := `mktemp -d` version := \"0.2.7\" tardir := tmpdir / \"awesomesauce-\" + version tarball := tardir + \".tar.gz\" publish: rm -f {{tarball}} mkdir {{tardir}} cp README.md *.c {{tardir}} tar zcvf {{tarball}} {{tardir}} scp {{tarball}} me@server.com:release/ rm -rf {{tarball}} {{tardir}}\n\n#### Joining Paths\n\nThe / operator can be used to join two strings with a slash:\n\n    \n    \n    foo := \"a\" / \"b\"\n    \n    \n    $ just --evaluate foo a/b\n\nNote that a / is added even if one is already present:\n\n    \n    \n    foo := \"a/\" bar := foo / \"b\"\n    \n    \n    $ just --evaluate bar a//b\n\nAbsolute paths can also be constructed^1.5.0:\n\n    \n    \n    foo := / \"b\"\n    \n    \n    $ just --evaluate foo /b\n\nThe / operator uses the / character, even on Windows. Thus, using the /\noperator should be avoided with paths that use universal naming convention\n(UNC), i.e., those that start with \\?, since forward slashes are not supported\nwith UNC paths.\n\n#### Escaping {{\n\nTo write a recipe containing {{, use {{{{:\n\n    \n    \n    braces: echo 'I {{{{LOVE}} curly braces!'\n\n(An unmatched }} is ignored, so it doesn't need to be escaped.)\n\nAnother option is to put all the text you'd like to escape inside of an\ninterpolation:\n\n    \n    \n    braces: echo '{{'I {{LOVE}} curly braces!'}}'\n\nYet another option is to use {{ \"{{\" }}:\n\n    \n    \n    braces: echo 'I {{ \"{{\" }}LOVE}} curly braces!'\n\n### Strings\n\nDouble-quoted strings support escape sequences:\n\n    \n    \n    string-with-tab := \"\\t\" string-with-newline := \"\\n\" string-with-carriage-return := \"\\r\" string-with-double-quote := \"\\\"\" string-with-slash := \"\\\\\" string-with-no-newline := \"\\ \"\n    \n    \n    $ just --evaluate \"tring-with-carriage-return := \" string-with-double-quote := \"\"\" string-with-newline := \" \" string-with-no-newline := \"\" string-with-slash := \"\\\" string-with-tab := \" \"\n\nStrings may contain line breaks:\n\n    \n    \n    single := ' hello ' double := \" goodbye \"\n\nSingle-quoted strings do not recognize escape sequences:\n\n    \n    \n    escapes := '\\t\\n\\r\\\"\\\\'\n    \n    \n    $ just --evaluate escapes := \"\\t\\n\\r\\\"\\\\\"\n\nIndented versions of both single- and double-quoted strings, delimited by\ntriple single- or triple double-quotes, are supported. Indented string lines\nare stripped of a leading line break, and leading whitespace common to all\nnon-blank lines:\n\n    \n    \n    # this string will evaluate to `foo\\nbar\\n` x := ''' foo bar ''' # this string will evaluate to `abc\\n wuv\\nxyz\\n` y := \"\"\" abc wuv xyz \"\"\"\n\nSimilar to unindented strings, indented double-quoted strings process escape\nsequences, and indented single-quoted strings ignore escape sequences. Escape\nsequence processing takes place after unindentation. The unindentation\nalgorithm does not take escape-sequence produced whitespace or newlines into\naccount.\n\n### Ignoring Errors\n\nNormally, if a command returns a non-zero exit status, execution will stop. To\ncontinue execution after a command, even if it fails, prefix the command with\n-:\n\n    \n    \n    foo: -cat foo echo 'Done!'\n    \n    \n    $ just foo cat foo cat: foo: No such file or directory echo 'Done!' Done!\n\n### Functions\n\njust provides a few built-in functions that might be useful when writing\nrecipes.\n\n#### System Information\n\n  * arch() \u2014 Instruction set architecture. Possible values are: \"aarch64\", \"arm\", \"asmjs\", \"hexagon\", \"mips\", \"msp430\", \"powerpc\", \"powerpc64\", \"s390x\", \"sparc\", \"wasm32\", \"x86\", \"x86_64\", and \"xcore\".\n  * num_cpus()^1.15.0 - Number of logical CPUs.\n  * os() \u2014 Operating system. Possible values are: \"android\", \"bitrig\", \"dragonfly\", \"emscripten\", \"freebsd\", \"haiku\", \"ios\", \"linux\", \"macos\", \"netbsd\", \"openbsd\", \"solaris\", and \"windows\".\n  * os_family() \u2014 Operating system family; possible values are: \"unix\" and \"windows\".\n\nFor example:\n\n    \n    \n    system-info: @echo \"This is an {{arch()}} machine\".\n    \n    \n    $ just system-info This is an x86_64 machine\n\nThe os_family() function can be used to create cross-platform justfiles that\nwork on various operating systems. For an example, see cross-platform.just\nfile.\n\n#### Environment Variables\n\n  * env_var(key) \u2014 Retrieves the environment variable with name key, aborting if it is not present.\n\n    \n    \n    home_dir := env_var('HOME') test: echo \"{{home_dir}}\"\n    \n    \n    $ just /home/user1\n\n  * env_var_or_default(key, default) \u2014 Retrieves the environment variable with name key, returning default if it is not present.\n  * env(key)^1.15.0 \u2014 Alias for env_var(key).\n  * env(key, default)^1.15.0 \u2014 Alias for env_var_or_default(key, default).\n\n#### Invocation Directory\n\n  * invocation_directory() - Retrieves the absolute path to the current directory when just was invoked, before just changed it (chdir'd) prior to executing commands. On Windows, invocation_directory() uses cygpath to convert the invocation directory to a Cygwin-compatible /-separated path. Use invocation_directory_native() to return the verbatim invocation directory on all platforms.\n\nFor example, to call rustfmt on files just under the \"current directory\" (from\nthe user/invoker's perspective), use the following rule:\n\n    \n    \n    rustfmt: find {{invocation_directory()}} -name \\*.rs -exec rustfmt {} \\;\n\nAlternatively, if your command needs to be run from the current directory, you\ncould use (e.g.):\n\n    \n    \n    build: cd {{invocation_directory()}}; ./some_script_that_needs_to_be_run_from_here\n\n  * invocation_directory_native() - Retrieves the absolute path to the current directory when just was invoked, before just changed it (chdir'd) prior to executing commands.\n\n#### Justfile and Justfile Directory\n\n  * justfile() - Retrieves the path of the current justfile.\n\n  * justfile_directory() - Retrieves the path of the parent directory of the current justfile.\n\nFor example, to run a command relative to the location of the current\njustfile:\n\n    \n    \n    script: ./{{justfile_directory()}}/scripts/some_script\n\n#### Just Executable\n\n  * just_executable() - Absolute path to the just executable.\n\nFor example:\n\n    \n    \n    executable: @echo The executable is at: {{just_executable()}}\n    \n    \n    $ just The executable is at: /bin/just\n\n#### Just Process ID\n\n  * just_pid() - Process ID of the just executable.\n\nFor example:\n\n    \n    \n    pid: @echo The process ID is: {{ just_pid() }}\n    \n    \n    $ just The process ID is: 420\n\n#### String Manipulation\n\n  * quote(s) - Replace all single quotes with '\\'' and prepend and append single quotes to s. This is sufficient to escape special characters for many shells, including most Bourne shell descendants.\n  * replace(s, from, to) - Replace all occurrences of from in s to to.\n  * replace_regex(s, regex, replacement) - Replace all occurrences of regex in s to replacement. Regular expressions are provided by the Rust regex crate. See the syntax documentation for usage examples. Capture groups are supported. The replacement string uses Replacement string syntax.\n  * trim(s) - Remove leading and trailing whitespace from s.\n  * trim_end(s) - Remove trailing whitespace from s.\n  * trim_end_match(s, pat) - Remove suffix of s matching pat.\n  * trim_end_matches(s, pat) - Repeatedly remove suffixes of s matching pat.\n  * trim_start(s) - Remove leading whitespace from s.\n  * trim_start_match(s, pat) - Remove prefix of s matching pat.\n  * trim_start_matches(s, pat) - Repeatedly remove prefixes of s matching pat.\n\n#### Case Conversion\n\n  * capitalize(s)^1.7.0 - Convert first character of s to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.\n  * kebabcase(s)^1.7.0 - Convert s to kebab-case.\n  * lowercamelcase(s)^1.7.0 - Convert s to lowerCamelCase.\n  * lowercase(s) - Convert s to lowercase.\n  * shoutykebabcase(s)^1.7.0 - Convert s to SHOUTY-KEBAB-CASE.\n  * shoutysnakecase(s)^1.7.0 - Convert s to SHOUTY_SNAKE_CASE.\n  * snakecase(s)^1.7.0 - Convert s to snake_case.\n  * titlecase(s)^1.7.0 - Convert s to Title Case.\n  * uppercamelcase(s)^1.7.0 - Convert s to UpperCamelCase.\n  * uppercase(s) - Convert s to uppercase.\n\n#### Path Manipulation\n\n##### Fallible\n\n  * absolute_path(path) - Absolute path to relative path in the working directory. absolute_path(\"./bar.txt\") in directory /foo is /foo/bar.txt.\n  * canonicalize(path)^1.24.0 - Canonicalize path by resolving symlinks and removing ., .., and extra /s where possible.\n  * extension(path) - Extension of path. extension(\"/foo/bar.txt\") is txt.\n  * file_name(path) - File name of path with any leading directory components removed. file_name(\"/foo/bar.txt\") is bar.txt.\n  * file_stem(path) - File name of path without extension. file_stem(\"/foo/bar.txt\") is bar.\n  * parent_directory(path) - Parent directory of path. parent_directory(\"/foo/bar.txt\") is /foo.\n  * without_extension(path) - path without extension. without_extension(\"/foo/bar.txt\") is /foo/bar.\n\nThese functions can fail, for example if a path does not have an extension,\nwhich will halt execution.\n\n##### Infallible\n\n  * clean(path) - Simplify path by removing extra path separators, intermediate . components, and .. where possible. clean(\"foo//bar\") is foo/bar, clean(\"foo/..\") is ., clean(\"foo/./bar\") is foo/bar.\n  * join(a, b...) - This function uses / on Unix and \\ on Windows, which can be lead to unwanted behavior. The / operator, e.g., a / b, which always uses /, should be considered as a replacement unless \\s are specifically desired on Windows. Join path a with path b. join(\"foo/bar\", \"baz\") is foo/bar/baz. Accepts two or more arguments.\n\n#### Filesystem Access\n\n  * path_exists(path) - Returns true if the path points at an existing entity and false otherwise. Traverses symbolic links, and returns false if the path is inaccessible or points to a broken symlink.\n\n##### Error Reporting\n\n  * error(message) - Abort execution and report error message to user.\n\n#### UUID and Hash Generation\n\n  * blake3(string)^1.25.0 - Return BLAKE3 hash of string as hexadecimal string.\n  * blake3_file(path)^1.25.0 - Return BLAKE3 hash of file at path as hexadecimal string.\n  * sha256(string) - Return the SHA-256 hash of string as hexadecimal string.\n  * sha256_file(path) - Return SHA-256 hash of file at path as hexadecimal string.\n  * uuid() - Generate a random version 4 UUID.\n\n#### Semantic Versions\n\n  * semver_matches(version, requirement)^1.16.0 - Check whether a semantic version, e.g., \"0.1.0\" matches a requirement, e.g., \">=0.1.0\", returning \"true\" if so and \"false\" otherwise.\n\n##### XDG Directories^1.23.0\n\nThese functions return paths to user-specific directories for things like\nconfiguration, data, caches, executables, and the user's home directory. These\nfunctions follow the XDG Base Directory Specification, and are implemented\nwith the dirs crate.\n\n  * cache_directory() - The user-specific cache directory.\n  * config_directory() - The user-specific configuration directory.\n  * config_local_directory() - The local user-specific configuration directory.\n  * data_directory() - The user-specific data directory.\n  * data_local_directory() - The local user-specific data directory.\n  * executable_directory() - The user-specific executable directory.\n  * home_directory() - The user's home directory.\n\n### Recipe Attributes\n\nRecipes may be annotated with attributes that change their behavior.\n\nName| Description  \n---|---  \n[confirm]^1.17.0| Require confirmation prior to executing recipe.  \n[confirm(\"prompt\")]^1.23.0| Require confirmation prior to executing recipe\nwith a custom prompt.  \n[linux]^1.8.0| Enable recipe on Linux.  \n[macos]^1.8.0| Enable recipe on MacOS.  \n[no-cd]^1.9.0| Don't change directory before executing recipe.  \n[no-exit-message]^1.7.0| Don't print an error message if recipe fails.  \n[no-quiet]^1.23.0| Override globally quiet recipes and always echo out the\nrecipe.  \n[private]^1.10.0| See Private Recipes.  \n[unix]^1.8.0| Enable recipe on Unixes. (Includes MacOS).  \n[windows]^1.8.0| Enable recipe on Windows.  \n  \nA recipe can have multiple attributes, either on multiple lines:\n\n    \n    \n    [no-cd] [private] foo: echo \"foo\"\n\nOr separated by commas on a single line^1.14.0:\n\n    \n    \n    [no-cd, private] foo: echo \"foo\"\n\n#### Enabling and Disabling Recipes^1.8.0\n\nThe [linux], [macos], [unix], and [windows] attributes are configuration\nattributes. By default, recipes are always enabled. A recipe with one or more\nconfiguration attributes will only be enabled when one or more of those\nconfigurations is active.\n\nThis can be used to write justfiles that behave differently depending on which\noperating system they run on. The run recipe in this justfile will compile and\nrun main.c, using a different C compiler and using the correct output binary\nname for that compiler depending on the operating system:\n\n    \n    \n    [unix] run: cc main.c ./a.out [windows] run: cl main.c main.exe\n\n#### Disabling Changing Directory^1.9.0\n\njust normally executes recipes with the current directory set to the directory\nthat contains the justfile. This can be disabled using the [no-cd] attribute.\nThis can be used to create recipes which use paths relative to the invocation\ndirectory, or which operate on the current directory.\n\nFor example, this commit recipe:\n\n    \n    \n    [no-cd] commit file: git add {{file}} git commit\n\nCan be used with paths that are relative to the current directory, because\n[no-cd] prevents just from changing the current directory when executing\ncommit.\n\n#### Requiring Confirmation for Recipes^1.17.0\n\njust normally executes all recipes unless there is an error. The [confirm]\nattribute allows recipes require confirmation in the terminal prior to\nrunning. This can be overridden by passing --yes to just, which will\nautomatically confirm any recipes marked by this attribute.\n\nRecipes dependent on a recipe that requires confirmation will not be run if\nthe relied upon recipe is not confirmed, as well as recipes passed after any\nrecipe that requires confirmation.\n\n    \n    \n    [confirm] delete-all: rm -rf *\n\n#### Custom Confirmation Prompt^1.23.0\n\nThe default confirmation prompt can be overridden with [confirm(PROMPT)]:\n\n    \n    \n    [confirm(\"Are you sure you want to delete everything?\")] delete-everything: rm -rf *\n\n### Command Evaluation Using Backticks\n\nBackticks can be used to store the result of commands:\n\n    \n    \n    localhost := `dumpinterfaces | cut -d: -f2 | sed 's/\\/.*//' | sed 's/ //g'` serve: ./serve {{localhost}} 8080\n\nIndented backticks, delimited by three backticks, are de-indented in the same\nmanner as indented strings:\n\n    \n    \n    # This backtick evaluates the command `echo foo\\necho bar\\n`, which produces the value `foo\\nbar\\n`. stuff := ``` echo foo echo bar ```\n\nSee the Strings section for details on unindenting.\n\nBackticks may not start with #!. This syntax is reserved for a future upgrade.\n\n### Conditional Expressions\n\nif/else expressions evaluate different branches depending on if two\nexpressions evaluate to the same value:\n\n    \n    \n    foo := if \"2\" == \"2\" { \"Good!\" } else { \"1984\" } bar: @echo \"{{foo}}\"\n    \n    \n    $ just bar Good!\n\nIt is also possible to test for inequality:\n\n    \n    \n    foo := if \"hello\" != \"goodbye\" { \"xyz\" } else { \"abc\" } bar: @echo {{foo}}\n    \n    \n    $ just bar xyz\n\nAnd match against regular expressions:\n\n    \n    \n    foo := if \"hello\" =~ 'hel+o' { \"match\" } else { \"mismatch\" } bar: @echo {{foo}}\n    \n    \n    $ just bar match\n\nRegular expressions are provided by the regex crate, whose syntax is\ndocumented on docs.rs. Since regular expressions commonly use backslash escape\nsequences, consider using single-quoted string literals, which will pass\nslashes to the regex parser unmolested.\n\nConditional expressions short-circuit, which means they only evaluate one of\ntheir branches. This can be used to make sure that backtick expressions don't\nrun when they shouldn't.\n\n    \n    \n    foo := if env_var(\"RELEASE\") == \"true\" { `get-something-from-release-database` } else { \"dummy-value\" }\n\nConditionals can be used inside of recipes:\n\n    \n    \n    bar foo: echo {{ if foo == \"bar\" { \"hello\" } else { \"goodbye\" } }}\n\nNote the space after the final }! Without the space, the interpolation will be\nprematurely closed.\n\nMultiple conditionals can be chained:\n\n    \n    \n    foo := if \"hello\" == \"goodbye\" { \"xyz\" } else if \"a\" == \"a\" { \"abc\" } else { \"123\" } bar: @echo {{foo}}\n    \n    \n    $ just bar abc\n\n### Stopping execution with error\n\nExecution can be halted with the error function. For example:\n\n    \n    \n    foo := if \"hello\" == \"goodbye\" { \"xyz\" } else if \"a\" == \"b\" { \"abc\" } else { error(\"123\") }\n\nWhich produce the following error when run:\n\n    \n    \n    error: Call to function `error` failed: 123 | 16 | error(\"123\")\n\n### Setting Variables from the Command Line\n\nVariables can be overridden from the command line.\n\n    \n    \n    os := \"linux\" test: build ./test --test {{os}} build: ./build {{os}}\n    \n    \n    $ just ./build linux ./test --test linux\n\nAny number of arguments of the form NAME=VALUE can be passed before recipes:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just os=plan9 ./build plan9 ./test --test plan9\n\nOr you can use the --set flag:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --set os bsd ./build bsd ./test --test bsd\n\n### Getting and Setting Environment Variables\n\n#### Exporting just Variables\n\nAssignments prefixed with the export keyword will be exported to recipes as\nenvironment variables:\n\n    \n    \n    export RUST_BACKTRACE := \"1\" test: # will print a stack trace if it crashes cargo test\n\nParameters prefixed with a $ will be exported as environment variables:\n\n    \n    \n    test $RUST_BACKTRACE=\"1\": # will print a stack trace if it crashes cargo test\n\nExported variables and parameters are not exported to backticks in the same\nscope.\n\n    \n    \n    export WORLD := \"world\" # This backtick will fail with \"WORLD: unbound variable\" BAR := `echo hello $WORLD`\n    \n    \n    # Running `just a foo` will fail with \"A: unbound variable\" a $A $B=`echo $A`: echo $A $B\n\nWhen export is set, all just variables are exported as environment variables.\n\n#### Getting Environment Variables from the environment\n\nEnvironment variables from the environment are passed automatically to the\nrecipes.\n\n    \n    \n    print_home_folder: echo \"HOME is: '${HOME}'\"\n    \n    \n    $ just HOME is '/home/myuser'\n\n#### Setting just Variables from Environment Variables\n\nEnvironment variables can be propagated to just variables using the functions\nenv_var() and env_var_or_default(). See environment-variables.\n\n### Recipe Parameters\n\nRecipes may have parameters. Here recipe build has a parameter called target:\n\n    \n    \n    build target: @echo 'Building {{target}}...' cd {{target}} && make\n\nTo pass arguments on the command line, put them after the recipe name:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just build my-awesome-project Building my-awesome-project... cd my-awesome-project && make\n\nTo pass arguments to a dependency, put the dependency in parentheses along\nwith the arguments:\n\n    \n    \n    default: (build \"main\") build target: @echo 'Building {{target}}...' cd {{target}} && make\n\nVariables can also be passed as arguments to dependencies:\n\n    \n    \n    target := \"main\" _build version: @echo 'Building {{version}}...' cd {{version}} && make build: (_build target)\n\nA command's arguments can be passed to dependency by putting the dependency in\nparentheses along with the arguments:\n\n    \n    \n    build target: @echo \"Building {{target}}...\" push target: (build target) @echo 'Pushing {{target}}...'\n\nParameters may have default values:\n\n    \n    \n    default := 'all' test target tests=default: @echo 'Testing {{target}}:{{tests}}...' ./test --tests {{tests}} {{target}}\n\nParameters with default values may be omitted:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just test server Testing server:all... ./test --tests all server\n\nOr supplied:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just test server unit Testing server:unit... ./test --tests unit server\n\nDefault values may be arbitrary expressions, but concatenations or path joins\nmust be parenthesized:\n\n    \n    \n    arch := \"wasm\" test triple=(arch + \"-unknown-unknown\") input=(arch / \"input.dat\"): ./test {{triple}}\n\nThe last parameter of a recipe may be variadic, indicated with either a + or a\n* before the argument name:\n\n    \n    \n    backup +FILES: scp {{FILES}} me@server.com:\n\nVariadic parameters prefixed with + accept one or more arguments and expand to\na string containing those arguments separated by spaces:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just backup FAQ.md GRAMMAR.md scp FAQ.md GRAMMAR.md me@server.com: FAQ.md 100% 1831 1.8KB/s 00:00 GRAMMAR.md 100% 1666 1.6KB/s 00:00\n\nVariadic parameters prefixed with * accept zero or more arguments and expand\nto a string containing those arguments separated by spaces, or an empty string\nif no arguments are present:\n\n    \n    \n    commit MESSAGE *FLAGS: git commit {{FLAGS}} -m \"{{MESSAGE}}\"\n\nVariadic parameters can be assigned default values. These are overridden by\narguments passed on the command line:\n\n    \n    \n    test +FLAGS='-q': cargo test {{FLAGS}}\n\n{{...}} substitutions may need to be quoted if they contain spaces. For\nexample, if you have the following recipe:\n\n    \n    \n    search QUERY: lynx https://www.google.com/?q={{QUERY}}\n\nAnd you type:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just search \"cat toupee\"\n\njust will run the command lynx https://www.google.com/?q=cat toupee, which\nwill get parsed by sh as lynx, https://www.google.com/?q=cat, and toupee, and\nnot the intended lynx and https://www.google.com/?q=cat toupee.\n\nYou can fix this by adding quotes:\n\n    \n    \n    search QUERY: lynx 'https://www.google.com/?q={{QUERY}}'\n\nParameters prefixed with a $ will be exported as environment variables:\n\n    \n    \n    foo $bar: echo $bar\n\n### Running Recipes at the End of a Recipe\n\nNormal dependencies of a recipes always run before a recipe starts. That is to\nsay, the dependee always runs before the depender. These dependencies are\ncalled \"prior dependencies\".\n\nA recipe can also have subsequent dependencies, which run after the recipe and\nare introduced with an &&:\n\n    \n    \n    a: echo 'A!' b: a && c d echo 'B!' c: echo 'C!' d: echo 'D!'\n\n...running b prints:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just b echo 'A!' A! echo 'B!' B! echo 'C!' C! echo 'D!' D!\n\n### Running Recipes in the Middle of a Recipe\n\njust doesn't support running recipes in the middle of another recipe, but you\ncan call just recursively in the middle of a recipe. Given the following\njustfile:\n\n    \n    \n    a: echo 'A!' b: a echo 'B start!' just c echo 'B end!' c: echo 'C!'\n\n...running b prints:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just b echo 'A!' A! echo 'B start!' B start! echo 'C!' C! echo 'B end!' B end!\n\nThis has limitations, since recipe c is run with an entirely new invocation of\njust: Assignments will be recalculated, dependencies might run twice, and\ncommand line arguments will not be propagated to the child just process.\n\n### Writing Recipes in Other Languages\n\nRecipes that start with #! are called shebang recipes, and are executed by\nsaving the recipe body to a file and running it. This lets you write recipes\nin different languages:\n\n    \n    \n    polyglot: python js perl sh ruby nu python: #!/usr/bin/env python3 print('Hello from python!') js: #!/usr/bin/env node console.log('Greetings from JavaScript!') perl: #!/usr/bin/env perl print \"Larry Wall says Hi!\\n\"; sh: #!/usr/bin/env sh hello='Yo' echo \"$hello from a shell script!\" nu: #!/usr/bin/env nu let hello = 'Hola' echo $\"($hello) from a nushell script!\" ruby: #!/usr/bin/env ruby puts \"Hello from ruby!\"\n    \n    \n    $ just polyglot Hello from python! Greetings from JavaScript! Larry Wall says Hi! Yo from a shell script! Hola from a nushell script! Hello from ruby!\n\nOn Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and MacOS, shebang recipes are\nexecuted by saving the recipe body to a file in a temporary directory, marking\nthe file as executable, and executing it. The OS then parses the shebang line\ninto a command line and invokes it, including the path to the file. For\nexample, if a recipe starts with #!/usr/bin/env bash, the final command that\nthe OS runs will be something like /usr/bin/env bash\n/tmp/PATH_TO_SAVED_RECIPE_BODY. Keep in mind that different operating systems\nsplit shebang lines differently.\n\nWindows does not support shebang lines. On Windows, just splits the shebang\nline into a command and arguments, saves the recipe body to a file, and\ninvokes the split command and arguments, adding the path to the saved recipe\nbody as the final argument. For example, on Windows, if a recipe starts with\n#! py, the final command the OS runs will be something like py\nC:\\Temp\\PATH_TO_SAVED_RECIPE_BODY.\n\n### Safer Bash Shebang Recipes\n\nIf you're writing a bash shebang recipe, consider adding set -euxo pipefail:\n\n    \n    \n    foo: #!/usr/bin/env bash set -euxo pipefail hello='Yo' echo \"$hello from Bash!\"\n\nIt isn't strictly necessary, but set -euxo pipefail turns on a few useful\nfeatures that make bash shebang recipes behave more like normal, linewise just\nrecipe:\n\n  * set -e makes bash exit if a command fails.\n\n  * set -u makes bash exit if a variable is undefined.\n\n  * set -x makes bash print each script line before it's run.\n\n  * set -o pipefail makes bash exit if a command in a pipeline fails. This is bash-specific, so isn't turned on in normal linewise just recipes.\n\nTogether, these avoid a lot of shell scripting gotchas.\n\n#### Shebang Recipe Execution on Windows\n\nOn Windows, shebang interpreter paths containing a / are translated from Unix-\nstyle paths to Windows-style paths using cygpath, a utility that ships with\nCygwin.\n\nFor example, to execute this recipe on Windows:\n\n    \n    \n    echo: #!/bin/sh echo \"Hello!\"\n\nThe interpreter path /bin/sh will be translated to a Windows-style path using\ncygpath before being executed.\n\nIf the interpreter path does not contain a / it will be executed without being\ntranslated. This is useful if cygpath is not available, or you wish to pass a\nWindows-style path to the interpreter.\n\n### Setting Variables in a Recipe\n\nRecipe lines are interpreted by the shell, not just, so it's not possible to\nset just variables in the middle of a recipe:\n\n    \n    \n    foo: x := \"hello\" # This doesn't work! echo {{x}}\n\nIt is possible to use shell variables, but there's another problem. Every\nrecipe line is run by a new shell instance, so variables set in one line won't\nbe set in the next:\n\n    \n    \n    foo: x=hello && echo $x # This works! y=bye echo $y # This doesn't, `y` is undefined here!\n\nThe best way to work around this is to use a shebang recipe. Shebang recipe\nbodies are extracted and run as scripts, so a single shell instance will run\nthe whole thing:\n\n    \n    \n    foo: #!/usr/bin/env bash set -euxo pipefail x=hello echo $x\n\n### Sharing Environment Variables Between Recipes\n\nEach line of each recipe is executed by a fresh shell, so it is not possible\nto share environment variables between recipes.\n\n#### Using Python Virtual Environments\n\nSome tools, like Python's venv, require loading environment variables in order\nto work, making them challenging to use with just. As a workaround, you can\nexecute the virtual environment binaries directly:\n\n    \n    \n    venv: [ -d foo ] || python3 -m venv foo run: venv ./foo/bin/python3 main.py\n\n### Changing the Working Directory in a Recipe\n\nEach recipe line is executed by a new shell, so if you change the working\ndirectory on one line, it won't have an effect on later lines:\n\n    \n    \n    foo: pwd # This `pwd` will print the same directory... cd bar pwd # ...as this `pwd`!\n\nThere are a couple ways around this. One is to call cd on the same line as the\ncommand you want to run:\n\n    \n    \n    foo: cd bar && pwd\n\nThe other is to use a shebang recipe. Shebang recipe bodies are extracted and\nrun as scripts, so a single shell instance will run the whole thing, and thus\na pwd on one line will affect later lines, just like a shell script:\n\n    \n    \n    foo: #!/usr/bin/env bash set -euxo pipefail cd bar pwd\n\n### Indentation\n\nRecipe lines can be indented with spaces or tabs, but not a mix of both. All\nof a recipe's lines must have the same type of indentation, but different\nrecipes in the same justfile may use different indentation.\n\nEach recipe must be indented at least one level from the recipe-name but after\nthat may be further indented.\n\nHere's a justfile with a recipe indented with spaces, represented as \u00b7, and\ntabs, represented as \u2192.\n\n    \n    \n    set windows-shell := [\"pwsh\", \"-NoLogo\", \"-NoProfileLoadTime\", \"-Command\"] set ignore-comments list-space directory: \u00b7\u00b7#!pwsh \u00b7\u00b7foreach ($item in $(Get-ChildItem {{directory}} )) { \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7echo $item.Name \u00b7\u00b7} \u00b7\u00b7echo \"\" # indentation nesting works even when newlines are escaped list-tab directory: \u2192 @foreach ($item in $(Get-ChildItem {{directory}} )) { \\ \u2192 \u2192 echo $item.Name \\ \u2192 } \u2192 @echo \"\"\n    \n    \n    PS > just list-space ~ Desktop Documents Downloads PS > just list-tab ~ Desktop Documents Downloads\n\n### Multi-Line Constructs\n\nRecipes without an initial shebang are evaluated and run line-by-line, which\nmeans that multi-line constructs probably won't do what you want.\n\nFor example, with the following justfile:\n\n    \n    \n    conditional: if true; then echo 'True!' fi\n\nThe extra leading whitespace before the second line of the conditional recipe\nwill produce a parse error:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just conditional error: Recipe line has extra leading whitespace | 3 | echo 'True!' | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo work around this, you can write conditionals on one line, escape newlines\nwith slashes, or add a shebang to your recipe. Some examples of multi-line\nconstructs are provided for reference.\n\n#### if statements\n\n    \n    \n    conditional: if true; then echo 'True!'; fi\n    \n    \n    conditional: if true; then \\ echo 'True!'; \\ fi\n    \n    \n    conditional: #!/usr/bin/env sh if true; then echo 'True!' fi\n\n#### for loops\n\n    \n    \n    for: for file in `ls .`; do echo $file; done\n    \n    \n    for: for file in `ls .`; do \\ echo $file; \\ done\n    \n    \n    for: #!/usr/bin/env sh for file in `ls .`; do echo $file done\n\n#### while loops\n\n    \n    \n    while: while `server-is-dead`; do ping -c 1 server; done\n    \n    \n    while: while `server-is-dead`; do \\ ping -c 1 server; \\ done\n    \n    \n    while: #!/usr/bin/env sh while `server-is-dead`; do ping -c 1 server done\n\n#### Outside Recipe Bodies\n\nParenthesized expressions can span multiple lines:\n\n    \n    \n    abc := ('a' + 'b' + 'c') abc2 := ( 'a' + 'b' + 'c' ) foo param=('foo' + 'bar' ): echo {{param}} bar: (foo 'Foo' ) echo 'Bar!'\n\nLines ending with a backslash continue on to the next line as if the lines\nwere joined by whitespace^1.15.0:\n\n    \n    \n    a := 'foo' + \\ 'bar' foo param1 \\ param2='foo' \\ *varparam='': dep1 \\ (dep2 'foo') echo {{param1}} {{param2}} {{varparam}} dep1: \\ # this comment is not part of the recipe body echo 'dep1' dep2 \\ param: echo 'Dependency with parameter {{param}}'\n\nBackslash line continuations can also be used in interpolations. The line\nfollowing the backslash must start with the same indentation as the recipe\nbody, although additional indentation is accepted.\n\n    \n    \n    recipe: echo '{{ \\ \"This interpolation \" + \\ \"has a lot of text.\" \\ }}' echo 'back to recipe body'\n\n### Command Line Options\n\njust supports a number of useful command line options for listing, dumping,\nand debugging recipes and variables:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --list Available recipes: js perl polyglot python ruby $ just --show perl perl: #!/usr/bin/env perl print \"Larry Wall says Hi!\\n\"; $ just --show polyglot polyglot: python js perl sh ruby\n\nRun just --help to see all the options.\n\n### Private Recipes\n\nRecipes and aliases whose name starts with a _ are omitted from just --list:\n\n    \n    \n    test: _test-helper ./bin/test _test-helper: ./bin/super-secret-test-helper-stuff\n    \n    \n    $ just --list Available recipes: test\n\nAnd from just --summary:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --summary test\n\nThe [private] attribute^1.10.0 may also be used to hide recipes or aliases\nwithout needing to change the name:\n\n    \n    \n    [private] foo: [private] alias b := bar bar:\n    \n    \n    $ just --list Available recipes: bar\n\nThis is useful for helper recipes which are only meant to be used as\ndependencies of other recipes.\n\n### Quiet Recipes\n\nA recipe name may be prefixed with @ to invert the meaning of @ before each\nline:\n\n    \n    \n    @quiet: echo hello echo goodbye @# all done!\n\nNow only the lines starting with @ will be echoed:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just quiet hello goodbye # all done!\n\nAll recipes in a Justfile can be made quiet with set quiet:\n\n    \n    \n    set quiet foo: echo \"This is quiet\" @foo2: echo \"This is also quiet\"\n\nThe [no-quiet] attribute overrides this setting:\n\n    \n    \n    set quiet foo: echo \"This is quiet\" [no-quiet] foo2: echo \"This is not quiet\"\n\nShebang recipes are quiet by default:\n\n    \n    \n    foo: #!/usr/bin/env bash echo 'Foo!'\n    \n    \n    $ just foo Foo!\n\nAdding @ to a shebang recipe name makes just print the recipe before executing\nit:\n\n    \n    \n    @bar: #!/usr/bin/env bash echo 'Bar!'\n    \n    \n    $ just bar #!/usr/bin/env bash echo 'Bar!' Bar!\n\njust normally prints error messages when a recipe line fails. These error\nmessages can be suppressed using the [no-exit-message]^1.7.0 attribute. You\nmay find this especially useful with a recipe that wraps a tool:\n\n    \n    \n    git *args: @git {{args}}\n    \n    \n    $ just git status fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git error: Recipe `git` failed on line 2 with exit code 128\n\nAdd the attribute to suppress the exit error message when the tool exits with\na non-zero code:\n\n    \n    \n    [no-exit-message] git *args: @git {{args}}\n    \n    \n    $ just git status fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\n\n### Selecting Recipes to Run With an Interactive Chooser\n\nThe --choose subcommand makes just invoke a chooser to select which recipes to\nrun. Choosers should read lines containing recipe names from standard input\nand print one or more of those names separated by spaces to standard output.\n\nBecause there is currently no way to run a recipe that requires arguments with\n--choose, such recipes will not be given to the chooser. Private recipes and\naliases are also skipped.\n\nThe chooser can be overridden with the --chooser flag. If --chooser is not\ngiven, then just first checks if $JUST_CHOOSER is set. If it isn't, then the\nchooser defaults to fzf, a popular fuzzy finder.\n\nArguments can be included in the chooser, i.e. fzf --exact.\n\nThe chooser is invoked in the same way as recipe lines. For example, if the\nchooser is fzf, it will be invoked with sh -cu 'fzf', and if the shell, or the\nshell arguments are overridden, the chooser invocation will respect those\noverrides.\n\nIf you'd like just to default to selecting recipes with a chooser, you can use\nthis as your default recipe:\n\n    \n    \n    default: @just --choose\n\n### Invoking justfiles in Other Directories\n\nIf the first argument passed to just contains a /, then the following occurs:\n\n  1. The argument is split at the last /.\n\n  2. The part before the last / is treated as a directory. just will start its search for the justfile there, instead of in the current directory.\n\n  3. The part after the last slash is treated as a normal argument, or ignored if it is empty.\n\nThis may seem a little strange, but it's useful if you wish to run a command\nin a justfile that is in a subdirectory.\n\nFor example, if you are in a directory which contains a subdirectory named\nfoo, which contains a justfile with the recipe build, which is also the\ndefault recipe, the following are all equivalent:\n\n    \n    \n    $ (cd foo && just build) $ just foo/build $ just foo/\n\nAdditional recipes after the first are sought in the same justfile. For\nexample, the following are both equivalent:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just foo/a b $ (cd foo && just a b)\n\nAnd will both invoke recipes a and b in foo/justfile.\n\n### Imports\n\nOne justfile can include the contents of another using import statements.\n\nIf you have the following justfile:\n\n    \n    \n    import 'foo/bar.just' a: b @echo A\n\nAnd the following text in foo/bar.just:\n\n    \n    \n    b: @echo B\n\nfoo/bar.just will be included in justfile and recipe b will be defined:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just b B $ just a B A\n\nThe import path can be absolute or relative to the location of the justfile\ncontaining it. A leading ~/ in the import path is replaced with the current\nusers home directory.\n\nJustfiles are insensitive to order, so included files can reference variables\nand recipes defined after the import statement.\n\nImported files can themselves contain imports, which are processed\nrecursively.\n\nWhen allow-duplicate-recipes is set, recipes in parent modules override\nrecipes in imports.\n\nImports may be made optional by putting a ? after the import keyword:\n\n    \n    \n    import? 'foo/bar.just'\n\nMissing source files for optional imports do not produce an error.\n\n### Modules^1.19.0\n\nA justfile can declare modules using mod statements. mod statements are\ncurrently unstable, so you'll need to use the --unstable flag, or set the\nJUST_UNSTABLE environment variable to use them.\n\nIf you have the following justfile:\n\n    \n    \n    mod bar a: @echo A\n\nAnd the following text in bar.just:\n\n    \n    \n    b: @echo B\n\nbar.just will be included in justfile as a submodule. Recipes, aliases, and\nvariables defined in one submodule cannot be used in another, and each module\nuses its own settings.\n\nRecipes in submodules can be invoked as subcommands:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --unstable bar b B\n\nOr with path syntax:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --unstable bar::b B\n\nIf a module is named foo, just will search for the module file in foo.just,\nfoo/mod.just, foo/justfile, and foo/.justfile. In the latter two cases, the\nmodule file may have any capitalization.\n\nModule statements may be of the form:\n\n    \n    \n    mod foo 'PATH'\n\nWhich loads the module's source file from PATH, instead of from the usual\nlocations. A leading ~/ in PATH is replaced with the current user's home\ndirectory.\n\nEnvironment files are only loaded for the root justfile, and loaded\nenvironment variables are available in submodules. Settings in submodules that\naffect environment file loading are ignored.\n\nRecipes in submodules without the [no-cd] attribute run with the working\ndirectory set to the directory containing the submodule source file.\n\njustfile() and justfile_directory() always return the path to the root\njustfile and the directory that contains it, even when called from submodule\nrecipes.\n\nModules may be made optional by putting a ? after the mod keyword:\n\n    \n    \n    mod? foo\n\nMissing source files for optional modules do not produce an error.\n\nOptional modules with no source file do not conflict, so you can have multiple\nmod statements with the same name, but with different source file paths, as\nlong as at most one source file exists:\n\n    \n    \n    mod? foo 'bar.just' mod? foo 'baz.just'\n\nSee the module stabilization tracking issue for more information.\n\n### Hiding justfiles\n\njust looks for justfiles named justfile and .justfile, which can be used to\nkeep a justfile hidden.\n\n### Just Scripts\n\nBy adding a shebang line to the top of a justfile and making it executable,\njust can be used as an interpreter for scripts:\n\n    \n    \n    $ cat > script <<EOF #!/usr/bin/env just --justfile foo: echo foo EOF $ chmod +x script $ ./script foo echo foo foo\n\nWhen a script with a shebang is executed, the system supplies the path to the\nscript as an argument to the command in the shebang. So, with a shebang of\n#!/usr/bin/env just --justfile, the command will be /usr/bin/env just\n--justfile PATH_TO_SCRIPT.\n\nWith the above shebang, just will change its working directory to the location\nof the script. If you'd rather leave the working directory unchanged, use\n#!/usr/bin/env just --working-directory . --justfile.\n\nNote: Shebang line splitting is not consistent across operating systems. The\nprevious examples have only been tested on macOS. On Linux, you may need to\npass the -S flag to env:\n\n    \n    \n    #!/usr/bin/env -S just --justfile default: echo foo\n\n### Formatting and dumping justfiles\n\nEach justfile has a canonical formatting with respect to whitespace and\nnewlines.\n\nYou can overwrite the current justfile with a canonically-formatted version\nusing the currently-unstable --fmt flag:\n\n    \n    \n    $ cat justfile # A lot of blank lines some-recipe: echo \"foo\" $ just --fmt --unstable $ cat justfile # A lot of blank lines some-recipe: echo \"foo\"\n\nInvoking just --fmt --check --unstable runs --fmt in check mode. Instead of\noverwriting the justfile, just will exit with an exit code of 0 if it is\nformatted correctly, and will exit with 1 and print a diff if it is not.\n\nYou can use the --dump command to output a formatted version of the justfile\nto stdout:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --dump > formatted-justfile\n\nThe --dump command can be used with --dump-format json to print a JSON\nrepresentation of a justfile.\n\n### Fallback to parent justfiles\n\nIf a recipe is not found in a justfile and the fallback setting is set, just\nwill look for justfiles in the parent directory and up, until it reaches the\nroot directory. just will stop after it reaches a justfile in which the\nfallback setting is false or unset.\n\nAs an example, suppose the current directory contains this justfile:\n\n    \n    \n    set fallback foo: echo foo\n\nAnd the parent directory contains this justfile:\n\n    \n    \n    bar: echo bar\n    \n    \n    $ just bar Trying ../justfile echo bar bar\n\n### Avoiding Argument Splitting\n\nGiven this justfile:\n\n    \n    \n    foo argument: touch {{argument}}\n\nThe following command will create two files, some and argument.txt:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just foo \"some argument.txt\"\n\nThe users shell will parse \"some argument.txt\" as a single argument, but when\njust replaces touch {{argument}} with touch some argument.txt, the quotes are\nnot preserved, and touch will receive two arguments.\n\nThere are a few ways to avoid this: quoting, positional arguments, and\nexported arguments.\n\n#### Quoting\n\nQuotes can be added around the {{argument}} interpolation:\n\n    \n    \n    foo argument: touch '{{argument}}'\n\nThis preserves just's ability to catch variable name typos before running, for\nexample if you were to write {{argument}}, but will not do what you want if\nthe value of argument contains single quotes.\n\n#### Positional Arguments\n\nThe positional-arguments setting causes all arguments to be passed as\npositional arguments, allowing them to be accessed with $1, $2, ..., and $@,\nwhich can be then double-quoted to avoid further splitting by the shell:\n\n    \n    \n    set positional-arguments foo argument: touch \"$1\"\n\nThis defeats just's ability to catch typos, for example if you type $2, but\nworks for all possible values of argument, including those with double quotes.\n\n#### Exported Arguments\n\nAll arguments are exported when the export setting is set:\n\n    \n    \n    set export foo argument: touch \"$argument\"\n\nOr individual arguments may be exported by prefixing them with $:\n\n    \n    \n    foo $argument: touch \"$argument\"\n\nThis defeats just's ability to catch typos, for example if you type $argumant,\nbut works for all possible values of argument, including those with double\nquotes.\n\n### Configuring the Shell\n\nThere are a number of ways to configure the shell for linewise recipes, which\nare the default when a recipe does not start with a #! shebang. Their\nprecedence, from highest to lowest, is:\n\n  1. The --shell and --shell-arg command line options. Passing either of these will cause just to ignore any settings in the current justfile.\n  2. set windows-shell := [...]\n  3. set windows-powershell (deprecated)\n  4. set shell := [...]\n\nSince set windows-shell has higher precedence than set shell, you can use set\nwindows-shell to pick a shell on Windows, and set shell to pick a shell for\nall other platforms.\n\n## Changelog\n\nA changelog for the latest release is available in CHANGELOG.md. Changelogs\nfor previous releases are available on the releases page. just --changelog can\nalso be used to make a just binary print its changelog.\n\n## Miscellanea\n\n### Companion Tools\n\nTools that pair nicely with just include:\n\n  * watchexec \u2014 a simple tool that watches a path and runs a command whenever it detects modifications.\n\n### Shell Alias\n\nFor lightning-fast command running, put alias j=just in your shell's\nconfiguration file.\n\nIn bash, the aliased command may not keep the shell completion functionality\ndescribed in the next section. Add the following line to your .bashrc to use\nthe same completion function as just for your aliased command:\n\n    \n    \n    complete -F _just -o bashdefault -o default j\n\n### Shell Completion Scripts\n\nShell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell, and Elvish are\navailable in the completions directory. Please refer to your shell's\ndocumentation for how to install them.\n\nThe just binary can also generate the same completion scripts at runtime,\nusing the --completions command:\n\n    \n    \n    $ just --completions zsh > just.zsh\n\nmacOS Note: Recent versions of macOS use zsh as the default shell. If you use\nHomebrew to install just, it will automatically install the most recent copy\nof the zsh completion script in the Homebrew zsh directory, which the built-in\nversion of zsh doesn't know about by default. It's best to use this copy of\nthe script if possible, since it will be updated whenever you update just via\nHomebrew. Also, many other Homebrew packages use the same location for\ncompletion scripts, and the built-in zsh doesn't know about those either. To\ntake advantage of just completion in zsh in this scenario, you can set fpath\nto the Homebrew location before calling compinit. Note also that Oh My Zsh\nruns compinit by default. So your .zshrc file could look like this:\n\n    \n    \n    # Init Homebrew, which adds environment variables eval \"$(brew shellenv)\" fpath=($HOMEBREW_PREFIX/share/zsh/site-functions $fpath) # Then choose one of these options: # 1. If you're using Oh My Zsh, you can initialize it here # source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh # 2. Otherwise, run compinit yourself # autoload -U compinit # compinit\n\n### Grammar\n\nA non-normative grammar of justfiles can be found in GRAMMAR.md.\n\n### just.sh\n\nBefore just was a fancy Rust program it was a tiny shell script that called\nmake. You can find the old version in contrib/just.sh.\n\n### User justfiles\n\nIf you want some recipes to be available everywhere, you have a few options.\n\nFirst, create a justfile in ~/.user.justfile with some recipes.\n\n#### Recipe Aliases\n\nIf you want to call the recipes in ~/.user.justfile by name, and don't mind\ncreating an alias for every recipe, add the following to your shell's\ninitialization script:\n\n    \n    \n    for recipe in `just --justfile ~/.user.justfile --summary`; do alias $recipe=\"just --justfile ~/.user.justfile --working-directory . $recipe\" done\n\nNow, if you have a recipe called foo in ~/.user.justfile, you can just type\nfoo at the command line to run it.\n\nIt took me way too long to realize that you could create recipe aliases like\nthis. Notwithstanding my tardiness, I am very pleased to bring you this major\nadvance in justfile technology.\n\n#### Forwarding Alias\n\nIf you'd rather not create aliases for every recipe, you can create a single\nalias:\n\n    \n    \n    alias .j='just --justfile ~/.user.justfile --working-directory .'\n\nNow, if you have a recipe called foo in ~/.user.justfile, you can just type .j\nfoo at the command line to run it.\n\nI'm pretty sure that nobody actually uses this feature, but it's there.\n\n\u0304\\\\_(\u30c4)_/ \u0304\n\n#### Customization\n\nYou can customize the above aliases with additional options. For example, if\nyou'd prefer to have the recipes in your justfile run in your home directory,\ninstead of the current directory:\n\n    \n    \n    alias .j='just --justfile ~/.user.justfile --working-directory ~'\n\n### Node.js package.json Script Compatibility\n\nThe following export statement gives just recipes access to local Node module\nbinaries, and makes just recipe commands behave more like script entries in\nNode.js package.json files:\n\n    \n    \n    export PATH := \"./node_modules/.bin:\" + env_var('PATH')\n\n### Alternatives and Prior Art\n\nThere is no shortage of command runners! Some more or less similar\nalternatives to just include:\n\n  * make: The Unix build tool that inspired just. There are a few different modern day descendents of the original make, including FreeBSD Make and GNU Make.\n  * task: A YAML-based command runner written in Go.\n  * maid: A Markdown-based command runner written in JavaScript.\n  * microsoft/just: A JavaScript-based command runner written in JavaScript.\n  * cargo-make: A command runner for Rust projects.\n  * mmake: A wrapper around make with a number of improvements, including remote includes.\n  * robo: A YAML-based command runner written in Go.\n  * mask: A Markdown-based command runner written in Rust.\n  * makesure: A simple and portable command runner written in AWK and shell.\n  * haku: A make-like command runner written in Rust.\n\n## Contributing\n\njust welcomes your contributions! just is released under the maximally\npermissive CC0 public domain dedication and fallback license, so your changes\nmust also be released under this license.\n\n### Janus\n\nJanus is a tool that collects and analyzes justfiles, and can determine if a\nnew version of just breaks or changes the interpretation of existing\njustfiles.\n\nBefore merging a particularly large or gruesome change, Janus should be run to\nmake sure that nothing breaks. Don't worry about running Janus yourself, Casey\nwill happily run it for you on changes that need it.\n\n### Minimum Supported Rust Version\n\nThe minimum supported Rust version, or MSRV, is current stable Rust. It may\nbuild on older versions of Rust, but this is not guaranteed.\n\n### New Releases\n\nNew releases of just are made frequently so that users quickly get access to\nnew features.\n\nRelease commit messages use the following template:\n\n    \n    \n    Release x.y.z - Bump version: x.y.z \u2192 x.y.z - Update changelog - Update changelog contributor credits - Update dependencies - Update man page - Update version references in readme\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### What are the idiosyncrasies of Make that Just avoids?\n\nmake has some behaviors which are confusing, complicated, or make it\nunsuitable for use as a general command runner.\n\nOne example is that under some circumstances, make won't actually run the\ncommands in a recipe. For example, if you have a file called test and the\nfollowing makefile:\n\n    \n    \n    test: ./test\n\nmake will refuse to run your tests:\n\n    \n    \n    $ make test make: `test' is up to date.\n\nmake assumes that the test recipe produces a file called test. Since this file\nexists and the recipe has no other dependencies, make thinks that it doesn't\nhave anything to do and exits.\n\nTo be fair, this behavior is desirable when using make as a build system, but\nnot when using it as a command runner. You can disable this behavior for\nspecific targets using make's built-in .PHONY target name, but the syntax is\nverbose and can be hard to remember. The explicit list of phony targets,\nwritten separately from the recipe definitions, also introduces the risk of\naccidentally defining a new non-phony target. In just, all recipes are treated\nas if they were phony.\n\nOther examples of make's idiosyncrasies include the difference between = and\n:= in assignments, the confusing error messages that are produced if you mess\nup your makefile, needing $$ to use environment variables in recipes, and\nincompatibilities between different flavors of make.\n\n### What's the relationship between Just and Cargo build scripts?\n\ncargo build scripts have a pretty specific use, which is to control how cargo\nbuilds your Rust project. This might include adding flags to rustc\ninvocations, building an external dependency, or running some kind of codegen\nstep.\n\njust, on the other hand, is for all the other miscellaneous commands you might\nrun as part of development. Things like running tests in different\nconfigurations, linting your code, pushing build artifacts to a server,\nremoving temporary files, and the like.\n\nAlso, although just is written in Rust, it can be used regardless of the\nlanguage or build system your project uses.\n\n## Further Ramblings\n\nI personally find it very useful to write a justfile for almost every project,\nbig or small.\n\nOn a big project with multiple contributors, it's very useful to have a file\nwith all the commands needed to work on the project close at hand.\n\nThere are probably different commands to test, build, lint, deploy, and the\nlike, and having them all in one place is useful and cuts down on the time you\nhave to spend telling people which commands to run and how to type them.\n\nAnd, with an easy place to put commands, it's likely that you'll come up with\nother useful things which are part of the project's collective wisdom, but\nwhich aren't written down anywhere, like the arcane commands needed for some\npart of your revision control workflow, to install all your project's\ndependencies, or all the random flags you might need to pass to the build\nsystem.\n\nSome ideas for recipes:\n\n  * Deploying/publishing the project\n\n  * Building in release mode vs debug mode\n\n  * Running in debug mode or with logging enabled\n\n  * Complex git workflows\n\n  * Updating dependencies\n\n  * Running different sets of tests, for example fast tests vs slow tests, or running them with verbose output\n\n  * Any complex set of commands that you really should write down somewhere, if only to be able to remember them\n\nEven for small, personal projects it's nice to be able to remember commands by\nname instead of ^Reverse searching your shell history, and it's a huge boon to\nbe able to go into an old project written in a random language with a\nmysterious build system and know that all the commands you need to do whatever\nyou need to do are in the justfile, and that if you type just something useful\n(or at least interesting!) will probably happen.\n\nFor ideas for recipes, check out this project's justfile, or some of the\njustfiles out in the wild.\n\nAnyways, I think that's about it for this incredibly long-winded README.\n\nI hope you enjoy using just and find great success and satisfaction in all\nyour computational endeavors!\n\n\ud83d\ude38\n\n## About\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Just a command runner\n\njust.systems\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nCC0-1.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n17.1k stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n66 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n392 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 102\n\n1.25.2 Latest\n\nMar 11, 2024\n\n\\+ 101 releases\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Used by 220\n\n\\+ 212\n\n## Contributors 150\n\n\\+ 136 contributors\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Rust 95.3%\n  * Shell 3.6%\n  * Makefile 0.7%\n  * CSS 0.2%\n  * HTML 0.1%\n  * Nushell 0.1%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
