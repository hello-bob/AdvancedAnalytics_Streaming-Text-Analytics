This review is a checkpoint in the lifetime of most NASA projects and\nmarks the moment when the agency formally commits to the final design,\nconstruction, and launch of a space mission. The outcome of each mission's\nconfirmation review typically establishes a budgetary and schedule commitment.\n\n\u201cDragonfly is a spectacular science mission with broad community interest, and\nwe are excited to take the next steps on this mission,\" said Nicky Fox,\nassociate administrator of NASA's science mission directorate. \"Exploring\nTitan will push the boundaries of what we can do with rotorcraft outside of\nEarth.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Dragonfly, NASA confirmed the mission with a total lifecycle\ncost of $3.35 billion and a launch date of July 2028. That is roughly twice\nthe mission's original proposed cost and a delay of more than two years from\nwhen the mission was originally selected in 2019, according to NASA.\n\n## Busting the cost cap\n\nRising costs are not necessarily a surprise on a mission as innovative as\nDragonfly. After reaching Titan, the eight-bladed rotorcraft lander will soar\nfrom place to place on Saturn's hazy moon, exploring environments rich in\norganic molecules, the building blocks of life.\n\nDragonfly will be the first mobile robot explorer to land on any other\nplanetary body besides the Moon and Mars, and only the second flying drone to\nexplore another planet. NASA's Ingenuity helicopter on Mars was the first.\nDragonfly will be more than 200 times as massive as Ingenuity and will operate\nsix times farther from Earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite its distant position in the cold outer Solar System, Titan appears to\nbe reminiscent of the ancient Earth. A shroud of orange haze envelops Saturn's\nlargest moon, and Titan's surface is covered with sand dunes and methane\nlakes.\n\nTitan's frigid temperatures\u2014hovering near minus 290\u00b0 Fahrenheit (minus 179\u00b0\nCelsius)\u2014mean water ice behaves like bedrock. NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which\nflew past Titan numerous times before its mission ended in 2017, discovered\nweather systems on the hazy moon. Observations from Cassini found evidence for\nhydrocarbon rains and winds that appear to generate waves in Titan's methane\nlakes.\n\nClearly, Titan is an exotic world. Most of what scientists know about Titan\ncomes from measurements collected by Cassini and the European Space Agency's\nHuygens probe, which Cassini released to land on Titan in 2005. Huygens\nreturned the first pictures from Titan's surface, but it only transmitted data\nfor 72 minutes.\n\nDragonfly will explore Titan for around three years, flying tens of kilometers\nabout once per month to measure the prebiotic chemistry of Titan's surface,\nstudy its soupy atmosphere, and search for biosignatures that could be\nindications of life. The mission will visit more than 30 locations within\nTitan's equatorial region, according to a presentation by Elizabeth Turtle,\nDragonfly's principal investigator at the Johns Hopkins University Applied\nPhysics Laboratory.\n\n\"The Dragonfly mission is an incredible opportunity to explore an ocean world\nin a way that we have never done before,\u201d Turtle said in a statement. \u201cThe\nteam is dedicated and enthusiastic about accomplishing this unprecedented\ninvestigation of the complex carbon chemistry that exists on the surface of\nTitan and the innovative technology bringing this first-of-its-kind space\nmission to life.\"\n\nHowever, this high level of ambition comes at a high cost. NASA selected\nDragonfly to proceed into initial development in 2019. Turtle's science team\nproposed Dragonfly to NASA through the agency's New Frontiers program, which\nhas developed a series of medium-class Solar System exploration missions. The\nNew Frontiers program has an impressive pedigree, beginning with the New\nHorizons mission that flew by Pluto in 2015, the Juno mission to Jupiter, and\nthe OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n107\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
