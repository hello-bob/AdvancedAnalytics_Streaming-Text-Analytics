Don\u2019t Let Them\n\nDEEPLINKS BLOG\n\nBy Chao Liu and Cooper Quintin\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n# Internet Service Providers Plan to Subvert Net Neutrality. Don\u2019t Let Them\n\nShare It Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Copy link\n\nIn the absence of strong net neutrality protections, internet service\nproviders (ISPs) have made all sorts of plans that would allow them to\ncapitalize on something called \"network slicing.\" While this technology has\nall sorts of promise, what the ISPs have planned would subvert net\nneutrality\u2014the principle that all data be treated equally by your service\nprovider\u2014by allowing them to recreate the kinds of \u201cfast lanes\u201d we've already\nagreed should not be allowed. If their plans succeed, then the new proposed\nnet neutrality protections will end up doing far less for consumers than the\nold rules did.\n\nThe FCC released draft rules to reinstate net neutrality, with a vote on\nadopting the rules to come the 25th of April. Overall, the order is a great\nstep for net neutrality. However, to be truly effective the rules must not\npreempt states from protecting their residents with stronger laws and clearly\nfind the creation of \u201cfast lanes\u201d via positive discrimination and unpaid\nprioritization of specific applications or services are violations of net\nneutrality.\n\n#### Fast Lanes and How They Could Harm Competition\n\nSince \u201cfast lanes\u201d aren\u2019t a technical term, what do we mean when we are\ntalking about a fast lane? To understand, it is helpful to think about data\ntraffic and internet networking infrastructure like car traffic and public\nroad systems. As roads connect people, goods, and services across distances,\nso does network infrastructure allow for data traffic to flow from one place\nto another. And just as a road with more capacity in the way of more lanes\ntheoretically means the road can support more traffic moving at speed1,\ninternet infrastructure with more \u201clanes\u201d (i.e. bandwidth) should mean that a\nnetwork can better support applications like streaming services and online\ngaming.\n\nIndividual ISPs have a maximum network capacity, and speed, of internet\ntraffic they can handle. To continue the analogy, the road leading to your\nneighborhood has a set number of lanes. This is why the speed of your internet\nmay change throughout the day. At peak hours your internet service may slow\ndown because a slowdown has occurred from too much requested traffic clogging\nup the lanes.\n\nIt\u2019s not inherently a bad thing to have specific lanes for certain types of\ntraffic, actual fast lanes on freeways can improve congestion by not making\nfaster moving vehicles compete for space with slower moving traffic, having\nexit and entry lanes in freeways also allows cars to perform specialized tasks\nwithout impeding other traffic. A lane only for buses isn\u2019t a bad thing as\nlong as every bus gets equal access to that lane and everyone has equal access\nto riding those buses. Where this becomes a problem is if there is a special\nlane only for Google buses, or for consuming entertainment content instead of\nparticipating in video calls. In these scenarios you would be increasing the\nquality of certain bus rides at the expense of degraded service for everyone\nelse on the road.\n\nAn internet \u201cfast lane\u201d would be the designation of part of the network with\nmore bandwidth and/or lower latency to only be used for certain services. On a\ntechnical level, the physical network infrastructure would be split amongst\nseveral different software defined networks with different use cases using\nnetwork slicing. One network might be optimized for high bandwidth\napplications such as video streaming, another might be optimized for\napplications needing low latency (e.g. a short distance between the client and\nthe server), and another might be optimized for IoT devices. The maximum\nphysical network capacity is split among these slices. To continue our\ntortured metaphor, your original six lane general road is now a four lane\ngeneral road with two lanes reserved for, say, a select list of streaming\nservices. Think dedicated high speed lanes for Disney+, HBO, and Netflix, but\nthose services only. In a network neutral construction of the infrastructure,\nall internet traffic shares all lanes, and no specific app or service is\nunfairly sped up or slowed down. This isn\u2019t to say that we are inherently\nagainst network management techniques like quality of service or network\nslicing. But it\u2019s important that quality of service efforts be undertaken, as\nmuch as possible, in an application agnostic manner.\n\nThe fast lanes metaphor isn\u2019t ideal. On the road having fast lanes is a good\nthing, it can protect more slow and cautious drivers from dangerous driving\nand improve the flow of traffic. Bike lanes are a good thing because they make\ncyclists safer and allow cars to drive more quickly and not have to navigate\naround them. But with traffic lanes it\u2019s the driver, not the road, that\ndecides which lane they belong in (with penalties for doing obviously bad\nfaith things such as driving in the bike lane.)\n\nInternet service providers (ISPs) are already testing their ability to create\nthese network slices. They already have plans of creating market offerings\nwhere certain applications and services, chosen by them, are given exclusive\nreserved fast lanes while the rest of the internet must shoulder their way\nthrough what is left. This kind of networking slicing is a violation of net\nneutrality. We aren\u2019t against network slicing as a technology, it could be\nuseful for things like remote surgery or vehicle to vehicle communication\nwhich requires low latency connections and is in the public interest, which\nare separate offerings and not part of the broadband services covered in the\ndraft order. We are against network slicing being used as a loophole to\ncircumvent principles of net neutrality.\n\n#### Fast Lanes Are a Clear Violation of Net Neutrality\n\nWhere net neutrality is the principle that all ISPs should treat all\nlegitimate traffic coming over their networks equally, discriminating between\ncertain applications or types of traffic is a clear violation of that\nprinciple. When fast lanes speed up certain applications or certain classes of\napplications, they cannot do so without having a negative impact on other\ninternet traffic, even if it\u2019s just by comparison. This is throttling, plain\nand simple.\n\nFurther, because ISPs choose which applications or types of services get to be\nin the fast lane, they choose winners and losers within the internet, which\nhas clear harms to both speech and competition. Whether your access to Disney+\nis faster than your access to Indieflix because Disney+ is sped up or because\nIndieflix is slowed down doesn\u2019t matter because the end result is the same:\nDisney+ is faster than Indieflix and so you are incentivized to use Disney+\nover Indieflix.\n\nISPs should not be able to harm competition even by deciding to prioritize\nincumbent services over new ones, or that one political party\u2019s website is\nfaster than another\u2019s. It is the consumer who should be in charge of what they\ndo online. Fast lanes have no place in a network neutral internet.\n\n  * 1\\. Urban studies research shows that this isn\u2019t actually the case, still it remains the popular wisdom among politicians and urban planners.\n\n## Related Issues\n\nNet Neutrality\n\nShare It Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Copy link\n\n## Join EFF Lists\n\n## Related Updates\n\nDeeplinks Blog by Chao Liu, Kit Walsh | April 16, 2024\n\n### Tell the FCC It Must Clarify Its Rules to Prevent Loopholes That Will\nSwallow Net Neutrality Whole\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released draft rules to\nreinstate net neutrality, with a vote on adopting the rules to come on the\n25th of April.
