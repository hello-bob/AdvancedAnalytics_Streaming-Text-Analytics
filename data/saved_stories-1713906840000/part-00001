I like\nfiguring things out. I like making things. And I want to do as much of that as\nI can. And part of being able to do that is to have the best personal\ninfrastructure I can. Over the years I\u2019ve been steadily accumulating and\nimplementing \u201cpersonal infrastructure hacks\u201d for myself. Some of them are,\nyes, quite nerdy. But they certainly help me be productive. And maybe in time\nmore and more of them will become mainstream, as a few already have.\n\nNow, of course, one giant \u201cproductivity hack\u201d that I\u2019ve been building for the\nworld for a very long time is the whole technology stack around the Wolfram\nLanguage. And for me personally, another huge \u201cproductivity hack\u201d is my\ncompany, which I started more than 32 years ago. Yes, it could (and should) be\nlarger, and have more commercial reach. But as a nicely organized private\ncompany with about 800 people it\u2019s an awfully efficient machine for turning\nideas into real things, and for leveraging what skills I have to greatly\namplify my personal productivity.\n\nI could talk about how I lead my life, and how I like to balance doing\nleadership, doing creative work, interacting with people, and doing things\nthat let me learn. I could talk about how I try to set things up so that what\nI\u2019ve already built doesn\u2019t keep me so busy I can\u2019t start anything new. But\ninstead what I\u2019m going to focus on here is my more practical personal\ninfrastructure: the technology and other things that help me live and work\nbetter, feel less busy, and be more productive every day.\n\nAt an intellectual level, the key to building this infrastructure is to\nstructure, streamline and automate everything as much as possible\u2014while\nrecognizing both what\u2019s realistic with current technology, and what fits with\nme personally. In many ways, it\u2019s a good, practical exercise in computational\nthinking, and, yes, it\u2019s a good application of some of the tools and ideas\nthat I\u2019ve spent so long building. Much of it can probably be helpful to lots\nof other people too; some of it is pretty specific to my personality, my\nsituation and my patterns of activity.\n\n## My Daily Life\n\nTo explain my personal infrastructure, I first have to say a bit about my\ndaily life. Something that often surprises people is that for 28 years I\u2019ve\nbeen a remote CEO. I\u2019m about as hands-on a CEO as they come. But I\u2019m only\nphysically \u201cin the office\u201d a few times a year. Mostly I\u2019m just at home,\ninteracting with the company with great intensity\u2014but purely through modern\nvirtual means:\n\nI\u2019m one of those CEOs who actually does a lot of stuff myself, as well as\nmanaging other people to do things. Being a remote CEO helps me achieve that,\nand stay focused. And partly following my example, our company has evolved a\nvery distributed culture, with people working scattered all over the world\n(it\u2019s all about being productive, rather than about \u201cshowing up\u201d):\n\nAt my desk, though, my basic view of all this is just:\n\nIt\u2019s always set up the same way. On the right is my main \u201cpublic display\u201d\nmonitor that I\u2019ll be screensharing most of the day with people I\u2019m talking to.\nOn the left is my secondary \u201cprivate display\u201d monitor that\u2019s got my email and\nmessages and other things that aren\u2019t directly relevant to the meetings I\u2019m\ndoing.\n\nFor the past year or so, I\u2019ve been livestreaming many of our software design\nmeetings\u2014and there are now 250 hours of archived screensharing, all from that\nright monitor of mine.\n\nParticularly since I\u2019m at my desk much of each day, I\u2019ve tried to optimize its\nergonomics. The keyboard is at the right height for optimal typing. The\nmonitors are at a height that\u2014especially given my \u201ccomputer distance\u201d\nmultifocal glasses\u2014forces my head to be in a good position when I look at\nthem, and not hunched over. I still use a \u201croll-around\u201d mouse (on the left,\nsince I\u2019m left-handed)\u2014because at least according to my latest measurements\nI\u2019m still faster with that than with any other pointing technology.\n\nAt the touch of a button, my desk goes to standing height:\n\nBut while standing may be better than sitting, I like to at least start my day\nwith something more active, and for more than a decade I\u2019ve been making sure\nto walk for a couple of hours every morning. But how can I be productive while\nI\u2019m walking? Well, nearly 15 years ago (i.e. long before it was popular!) I\nset up a treadmill with a computer in the room next to my office:\n\nThe biomechanics weren\u2019t too hard to work out. I found out that by putting a\ngel strip at the correct pivot point under my wrists (and putting the mouse on\na platform) I can comfortably type while I\u2019m walking. I typically use a 5%\nincline and go at 2 mph\u2014and I\u2019m at least fit enough that I don\u2019t think anyone\ncan tell I\u2019m walking while I\u2019m talking in a meeting. (And, yes, I try to get\npotentially frustrating meetings scheduled during my walking time, so if I do\nin fact get frustrated I can just \u201cwalk it off\u201d by making the treadmill go a\nlittle faster.)\n\nFor many years I\u2019ve kept all kinds of personal analytics data on myself, and\nfor the past couple of years this has included continuous heart-rate data.\nEarly last summer I noticed that for a couple of weeks my resting heart rate\nhad noticeably gone down. At first I thought it was just because I happened to\nbe systematically doing something I liked then. But later in the summer, it\nhappened again. And then I realized: those were times when I wasn\u2019t walking\ninside on a treadmill; instead (for different reasons) I was walking outside.\n\nFor many years my wife had been extolling the virtues of spending time\noutside. But it had never really seemed practical for me. Yes, I could talk on\nthe phone (or, in rare cases, actually talk to someone I was walking with). Or\nI could be walking with a tablet, perhaps watching someone else\nscreensharing\u2014as I did, rather unstylishly, for a week late last summer during\nmy version of a vacation:\n\nI\u2019d actually been thinking about walking and working for a long time. Twenty\nyears ago I imagined doing it with an augmented reality display and a one-\nhanded (chorded) keyboard. But the technology didn\u2019t arrive, and I wasn\u2019t even\nsure the ergonomics would work out (would it make me motion sick, for\nexample?).\n\nBut then, last spring, I was at a fancy tech event, and I happened to be just\nout of the frame of a photo op that involved Jeff Bezos walking with a robotic\ndog. I wasn\u2019t personally so excited about the robotic dog. But what really\ninterested me was the person walking out of the frame on the other side,\nintently controlling the dog\u2014using a laptop that he had strapped on in front\nof him as if he were selling popcorn.\n\nCould one actually work like this, typing and everything? After my \u201cheart-rate\ndiscovery\u201d I decided I had to try it. I thought I\u2019d have to build something\nmyself, but actually one can just buy \u201cwalking desks\u201d, and so I did. And after\nminor modifications, I discovered that I could walk and type perfectly well\nwith it, even for a couple of hours. I was embarrassed I hadn\u2019t figured out\nsuch a simple solution 20 years ago. But starting last fall\u2014whenever the\nweather\u2019s been good\u2014I\u2019ve tried to spend a couple of hours of each day walking\noutside like this:\n\nAnd even when I\u2019m intently concentrating on my computer, it\u2019s somehow nice to\nbe outside\u2014and, yes, it seems to have made my resting heart rate go down. And\nI seem to have enough peripheral vision\u2014or perhaps I\u2019ve just been walking in\n\u201csimple enough\u201d environments\u2014that I haven\u2019t tripped even when I\u2019m not\nconsciously paying attention. No doubt it helps that I haven\u2019t mostly been\nwalking in public places, so there aren\u2019t other people around. Of course, that\nalso means that I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to get the kind of curious\nstares I did in 1987 when I first walked down a city street talking on a shoe-\nsized cellphone....\n\n## My Desk Environment\n\nI\u2019ve had the same big wooden desk for 25 years. And needless to say, I had it\nconstructed with some special features. One of my theories of personal\norganization is that any flat surface represents a potential \u201cstagnation\npoint\u201d that will tend to accumulate piles of stuff\u2014and the best way to avoid\nsuch piles is just to avoid having permanent flat surfaces. But one inevitably\nneeds some flat surface, if only just to sign things (it\u2019s not all digital\nyet), or to eat a snack. So my solution is to have pullouts. If one needs\nthem, pull them out. But one can\u2019t leave them pulled out, so nothing can\naccumulate on them:\n\nThese days I don\u2019t deal with paper much. But whenever something does come\nacross my desk, I like to file it. So behind my desk I have an array of\ndrawers\u2014with the little hack that there\u2019s a slot at the top of each drawer\nthat allows me to immediately slide things into the drawer, without opening\nit:\n\nI used to fill up a banker\u2019s box with filed papers every couple of months; now\nit seems to take a couple of years. And perhaps as a sign of how paperless\nI\u2019ve become, I have a printer under my desk that I use so rarely that I now\nseem to go through a ream of paper only every year or so.\n\nThere are also other things that have changed over the years. I always want my\nmain computer to be as powerful as possible. And for years that meant that it\nhad to have a big fan to dissipate heat. But since I really like my office to\nbe perfectly quiet (it adds a certain calmness that helps my concentration), I\nhad to put the CPU part of my computer in a different room. And to achieve\nthis, I had a conduit in the floor, through which I had to run often-finicky\nlong-distance video cables. Well, now, finally, I have a powerful computer\nthat doesn\u2019t need a big fan\u2014and so I just keep it behind my desk. (I actually\nalso have three other not-so-quiet computers that I keep in the same room as\nthe treadmill, so that when I\u2019m on the treadmill I can experience all three\nmain modern computing environments, choosing between them with a KVM switch.)\n\nWhen I mention to people that I\u2019m a remote CEO, they often say, \u201cYou must do\nlots of videoconferencing\u201d. Well, actually, I do basically no\nvideoconferencing. Screensharing is great, and critical. But typically I find\nvideo distracting. Often I\u2019ll do a meeting where I have lots of people in case\nwe need to get their input. But for most of the meeting I don\u2019t need all of\nthem to be paying attention (and I\u2019m happy if they\u2019re getting other work\ndone). But if video is on, seeing people who are not paying attention just\nseems to viscerally kill the mood of almost any meeting.\n\nGiven that I don\u2019t have video, audio is very important, and I\u2019m quite a\nstickler for audio quality in meetings. No speakerphones. No bad cellphone\nconnections. I myself remain quite old school. I wear a headset (with padding\nadded to compensate for my lack of top-of-head hair) with a standard boom\nmicrophone. And\u2014partly out of caution about having a radio transmitter next to\nmy head all day\u2014my headset is wired, albeit with a long wire that lets me roam\naround my office.\n\nEven though I don\u2019t use \u201ctalking head\u201d video for meetings, I do have a\ndocument camera next to my computer. One time I\u2019ll use this is when we\u2019re\ntalking about phones or tablets. Yes, I could connect their video directly\ninto my computer. But if we\u2019re discussing user experience on a phone it\u2019s\noften helpful to be able to actually see my finger physically touching the\nphone.\n\nThe document camera also comes in handy when I want to show pages from a\nphysical book, or artifacts of various kinds. When I want to draw something\nsimple I\u2019ll use the annotation capabilities of our screensharing system. But\nwhen I\u2019m trying to draw something more elaborate I\u2019ll usually do the retro\nthing of putting a piece of paper under the document camera, then just using a\npen. I like the fact that the image from the document camera comes up in a\nwindow on my screen, that I can resize however I want. (I periodically try\nusing drawing tablets but I don\u2019t like the way they treat my whole screen as a\ncanvas, rather than operating in a window that I can move around.)\n\n## On the Move\n\nIn some ways I lead a simple life, mostly at my desk. But there are plenty of\ntimes when I\u2019m away from my desk\u2014like when I\u2019m someplace else in my house, or\nwalking outside. And in those cases I\u2019ll normally take a 13\u2032\u2032 laptop to use.\nWhen I go further afield, it gets a bit more complicated.\n\nIf I\u2019m going to do serious work, or give a talk, I\u2019ll take the 13\u2032\u2032 laptop.\nBut I never like to be computerless, and the 13\u2032\u2032 laptop is a heavy thing to\nlug around. So instead I also have a tiny 2-lb laptop, which I put in a little\nbag (needless to say, both the bag and the computer are adorned with our\nSpikey logo):\n\nAnd for at least the past couple of years\u2014unless I\u2019m bringing the bigger\ncomputer, usually in a backpack\u2014I have taken to \u201cwearing\u201d my little computer\nwherever I go. I originally wanted a bag where the computer would fit\ncompletely inside, but the nicest bag I could find had the computer sticking\nout a bit. To my surprise, though, this has worked well. And it\u2019s certainly\namusing when I\u2019m talking to someone and quickly \u201cdraw\u201d my computer, and they\nlook confused, and ask, \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d\n\nI always have my phone in my pocket, and if I have just a few moments that\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019ll pull out. It works fine if I\u2019m checking mail, and deleting or\nforwarding a few messages. If I actually want to write anything serious,\nthough, out will come my little computer, with its full keyboard. Of course,\nif I\u2019m standing up it\u2019s pretty impractical to try to balance the computer on\none hand and type with the other. And sometimes if I know I\u2019m going to be\nstanding for a while, I\u2019ll bring a tablet with me. But other times, I\u2019ll just\nbe stuck with my phone. And if I run out of current things I can usefully do\n(or I don\u2019t have an internet connection) I\u2019ll typically start looking at the\n\u201cthings to read\u201d folder that I maintain synched on all my devices.\n\nBack in 2007 I invented WolframTones because I wanted to have a unique\nringtone for my phone. But while WolframTones has been successful as an\nexample of algorithmic music composition, the only trace of it on my phone is\nthe image of WolframTones compositions that I use as my home screen:\n\nHow do I take notes when I\u2019m \u201cout and about\u201d? I\u2019ve tried various technological\nsolutions, but in the end none have proved both practical and universally\nsocially acceptable. So I\u2019ve kept doing the same thing for 40 years: in my\npocket I have a pen, together with a piece of paper folded three times (so\nit\u2019s about the size of a credit card). It\u2019s very low-tech, but it works. And\nwhen I come back from being out I always take a few moments to transcribe what\nI wrote down, send out emails, or whatever.\n\nI have little \u201ctech survival kits\u201d that I bring with me. Here are the current\ncontents from my backpack:\n\nThe centerpiece is a tiny charger, that charges both my computer (through\nUSB-C) and my phone. I bring various connectors, notably so I can connect to\nthings like projectors. I also bring a very light 2- to 3-prong power adaptor,\nso I don\u2019t find my charger falling out of overused power outlets.\n\nWhen I\u2019m going on \u201cmore serious expeditions\u201d I\u2019ll add some things to the kit:\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201ccharging brick\u201d (unfortunately now in short supply) that\u2019ll keep my\ncomputer going for many hours. For events like trade shows, I\u2019ll bring a tiny\ncamera that takes pictures every 30 seconds, so I can remember what I saw. And\nif I\u2019m really going out into the wilds, I\u2019ll bring a satphone as well. (Of\ncourse, I always have other stuff too, like a very thin and floppy hat, a\nlight neoprene bag-within-a-bag, glasses wipes, hand sanitizer, mosquito\nwipes, business cards, pieces of chocolate, etc.)\n\nIn my efforts to keep organized on trips, I\u2019ll typically pack several plastic\nenvelopes:\n\nIn \u201cPresentation\u201d there\u2019ll be the adaptors (VGA, HDMI, ...) I need to connect\nto projectors. Sometimes there\u2019ll be a wired Ethernet adaptor. (For very low-\nkey presentations, I\u2019ll also sometimes bring a tiny projector too.) In \u201cCar\u201d\nthere\u2019ll be a second cellphone that can be used as a GPS, with a magnetic back\nand a tiny thing for attaching to the air vent in a car. There\u2019ll be a\nmonaural headset, a phone charger, and sometimes a tiny inverter for my\ncomputer. If I\u2019m bringing the satphone, there\u2019ll also be a car kit for it,\nwith an antenna that magnets to the roof of the car, so it can \u201csee\u201d the\nsatellites. In \u201cHotel\u201d there\u2019ll be a binaural headset, a second computer\ncharger, and a disk with an encrypted backup of my computer, in case I lose my\ncomputer and have to buy and configure a new machine. The fourth plastic\nenvelope is used to store things I get on the trip, and it contains little\nenvelopes\u2014approximately one for each day of my trip\u2014in which I put business\ncards.\n\nYears ago, I always used to bring a little white-noise fan with me, to mask\nbackground noise, particularly at night. But at some point I realized that I\ndidn\u2019t need a physical fan, and instead I just have an app that simulates it\n(I used to use pink noise, but now I just use \u201cair conditioner sound\u201d). It\u2019s\noften something of a challenge to predict just how loud the outside noise\none\u2019s going to encounter (say, the next morning) will be, and so how loud one\nshould set the masking sound. And, actually, as I write this, I realize I\nshould use modern audio processing in the Wolfram Language to just listen to\nexternal sounds, and adjust the masking sound to cover them.\n\nAnother thing I need when I travel is a clock. And nowadays it\u2019s just a piece\nof Wolfram Language code running on my computer. But because it\u2019s software, it\ncan have a few extra features. I always leave my computer on my home timezone,\nso the \u201cclock\u201d has a slider to specify local time (yes, if I\u2019m ever in a half-\nhour timezone again I\u2019ll have to tweak the code). It also has a button Start\nsleep timer. When I press it, it starts a count-up timer, which lets me see\nhow long I\u2019ve been asleep, whatever my biological clock may say. (Start sleep\ntimer also sends an email which gives my assistant an idea of whether or not\nI\u2019ll make it to that early-next-morning meeting. The top right-hand \u201cmouse\ncorner\u201d is a hack for preventing the computer from going to sleep.)\n\nWhenever it\u2019s practical, I like to drive myself places. It was a different\nstory before cellphones. But nowadays if I\u2019m driving I\u2019m productively making a\nphone call. I\u2019ll have meetings that don\u2019t require me to look at anything\nscheduled for my \u201cdrive times\u201d (and, yes, it\u2019s nice to have standard\nconference call numbers programmed in my phone, so I can voice-dial them). And\nI maintain a \u201ccall-while-driving\u201d list of calls that I can do while driving,\nparticularly if I\u2019m in an unusual-for-me timezone.\n\nI\u2019ve always had the problem that if I try to work on a computer while I\u2019m\nbeing driven by someone else, I get car sick. I thought I had tried\neverything. Big cars. Little cars. Hard suspension. Soft suspension. Front\nseat. Back seat. Nothing worked. But a couple of years ago, quite by chance, I\ntried listening to music with big noise-canceling headphones\u2014and I didn\u2019t get\ncar sick. But what if when I\u2019m being driven I want to be on the phone while\nI\u2019m using my computer? Well, at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, despite my\nson\u2019s admonition that \u201cjust because you can\u2019t tell what they\u2019re selling at a\nbooth doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s interesting\u201d, I stopped at a booth and got these\nstrange objects, which, despite looking a bit odd, do seem to prevent car\nsickness for me, at least much of the time:\n\n## Giving Talks\n\nI give quite a lot of talks\u2014to a very wide range of audiences. I particularly\nlike giving talks about subjects I haven\u2019t talked about before. I give talks\nto the fanciest business, tech and science groups. I give talks to schoolkids.\nI enjoy interacting with audiences (Q&A is always my favorite part), and I\nenjoy being spontaneous. And I essentially always end up doing livecoding.\n\nWhen I was young I traveled quite a bit. I did have portable computers even\nback in the 1980s (my first was an Osborne 1 in 1981), though mostly in those\ndays my only way to stay computer-productive was to have workstation computers\nshipped to my destinations. Then in the early 1990s, I decided I wasn\u2019t going\nto travel anymore (not least because I was working so intensely on A New Kind\nof Science). So for a while I basically didn\u2019t give any talks. But then\ntechnology advanced. And it started being realistic to give talks through\nvideoconferencing.\n\nI went through several generations of technology, but a number of years ago I\nbuilt out a videoconferencing setup in my basement. The \u201cset\u201d can be\nreconfigured in various ways (podium, desk, etc.) But basically I have a back-\nprojection screen on which I can see the remote audience. The camera is in\nfront of the screen, positioned so I\u2019m looking straight at it. If I\u2019m using\nnotes or a script (which, realistically, is rare) I have a homemade\nteleprompter consisting of a half-silvered mirror and a laptop that I can look\nat the camera through.\n\nWhile it\u2019s technically feasible for me to be looking straight at the camera\nwhen I\u2019m livecoding, this makes it look to the audience as if I\u2019m staring off\ninto space, which seems weird. It\u2019s better to look slightly down when I\u2019m\nobviously looking at a screen. And in fact with some setups it\u2019s good for the\naudience to see the top of a computer right at the bottom of the screen, to\n\u201cexplain\u201d what I\u2019m looking at.\n\nVideoconferenced talks work quite well in many settings (and, for some extra\nfun, I\u2019ve sometimes used a telepresence robot). But in recent years (partly as\na result of my children wanting to do it with me) I\u2019ve decided that traveling\nis OK\u2014and I\u2019ve been all over the place:\n\nI\u2019ll usually be giving talks\u2014often several per day. And I\u2019ve gradually\ndeveloped an elaborate checklist of what\u2019s needed to have them work. A podium\nthat\u2019s at the right height and horizontal enough to let me type easily on my\ncomputer (and preferably not so massive that I\u2019m hidden from the audience). An\nattachable microphone that leaves my hands free to type. A network connection\nthat lets me reach our servers. And, of course, to let the audience actually\nsee things, a computer projector.\n\nI remember the very first computer projector I used, in 1980. It was a Hughes\n\u201cliquid crystal light valve\u201d, and once I got it connected to a CRT terminal,\nit worked beautifully. In the years since then I\u2019ve used computer projectors\nall over the world, both in the fanciest audiovisual situations, and in\noutlying places with ancient equipment and poor infrastructure. And it\u2019s\namazing how random it is. In places where one can\u2019t imagine the projector is\ngoing to work, it\u2019ll be just fine. And in places where one can\u2019t imagine it\nwon\u2019t work, it\u2019ll fail horribly.\n\nSome years ago I was giving a talk at TED\u2014with some of the fanciest\naudiovisual equipment I\u2019d ever seen. And that was one of the places where\nthings failed horribly. Fortunately we did a test the day before. But it took\na solid three hours to get the top-of-the-line computer projector to\nsuccessfully project my computer\u2019s screen.\n\nAnd as a result of that very experience I decided I\u2019d better actually\nunderstand how computers talk to projectors. It\u2019s a complicated business, that\ninvolves having the computer and the projector negotiate to find a resolution,\naspect ratio, frame rate, etc. that will work for both of them. Underneath,\nthere are things called EDID strings that are exchanged, and these are what\ntypically get tangled up. Computer operating systems have gotten much better\nabout handling this in recent years, but for high-profile, high-production-\nvalue events, I have a little box that spoofs EDID strings to force my\ncomputer to send a specific signal, regardless of what the projector seems to\nbe asking it for.\n\nSome of the talks I give are completely spontaneous. But often I\u2019ll have\nnotes\u2014and occasionally even a script. And I\u2019ll always write these in a Wolfram\nNotebook. I then have code that \u201cpaginates\u201d them, basically replicating\n\u201cparagraphs\u201d at the end of each page, so I have freedom in when I \u201cturn the\npage\u201d. In past years I used to transfer these notes to an iPad that I\u2019d set up\nto \u201cturn the page\u201d whenever I touched its screen. But in recent years I\u2019ve\nactually just synched files, and used my little computer for my notes\u2014which\nhas the advantage that I can edit them right up to the moment I start giving\nthe talk.\n\nIn addition to notes, I\u2019ll sometimes also have material that I want to\nimmediately bring into the talk. Now that we have our new Presenter Tools\nsystem, I may start creating more slide-show-like material. But that\u2019s not how\nI\u2019ve traditionally worked. Instead, I\u2019ll typically just have a specific piece\nof Wolfram Language code I want to input, without having to take the time to\nexplicitly type it. Or perhaps I\u2019ll want to pick an image from a \u201cslide farm\u201d\nthat I want to immediately put on the screen, say in response to a question.\n(There\u2019s a lot of trickiness about projector resolutions in, for example,\nslides of cellular automata, because unless they\u2019re \u201cpixel perfect\u201d they\u2019ll\nalias\u2014and it\u2019s not good enough just to scale them like typical slide software\nwould.)\n\nSo how do I deal with bringing in this material? Well, I have a second display\nconnected to my computer\u2014whose image isn\u2019t projected. (And, yes, this can\ncontribute to horrible tangling of EDID strings.) Then on that second display\nI can have things to click or copy. (I have a Wolfram Language function that\nwill take a notebook of inputs and URLs, and make me a palette that I can\nclick to type inputs, open webpages, etc.)\n\nIn the past we used to have a little second monitor to attach to my\nlaptop\u2014essentially a disembodied laptop screen. But it took all sorts of\nkludges to get both it and the projector connected to my laptop (sometimes one\nwould be USB, one would be HDMI, etc.) But now we can just use an iPad\u2014and\nit\u2019s all pure software (though the interaction with projectors can still be\nfinicky):\n\nFor a while, just to be stylish, I was using a computer with a Spikey carved\nout of its case, and backlit. But the little rhombuses in it were a bit\nfragile, so nowadays I mostly just use \u201cSpikey skins\u201d on my computers:\n\n## My Filesystem\n\nThe three main applications I use all day are Wolfram Desktop, a web browser,\nand email. My main way of working is to create (or edit) Wolfram Notebooks.\nHere are a few notebooks I worked on today:\n\nOn a good day I\u2019ll type at least 25,000 characters into Wolfram Notebooks\n(and, yes, I record all my keystrokes). I always organize my notebooks into\nsections and subsections and so on (which, very conveniently, automatically\nexist in hierarchical cells). Sometimes I\u2019ll write mostly text in a notebook.\nSometimes I\u2019ll screen capture something from elsewhere and paste it in, as a\nway to keep notes. Depending on what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019ll also actually do\ncomputations in a notebook, entering Wolfram Language input, getting results,\netc.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve accumulated over a hundred thousand notebooks,\nrepresenting product designs, plans, research, writings, and, basically,\neverything I do. All these notebooks are ultimately stored in my filesystem\n(yes, I sync with the cloud, use cloud files, and file servers, etc.) And I\ntake pains to keep my filesystem organized\u2014with the result I can typically\nfind any notebook I\u2019m looking for just by navigating my filesystem, faster\nthan I could formulate a search for it.\n\nI believe I first thought seriously about how to organize my files back in\n1978 (which was also when I started using the Unix operating system). And over\nthe past 40 years I\u2019ve basically gone through five generations of filesystem\norganization, with each generation basically being a reflection of how I\u2019m\norganizing my work at that stage in my life.\n\nFor example, during the period from 1991 to 2002 when I was writing my big\nbook A New Kind of Science, a substantial part of my filesystem was organized\nsimply according to sections of the book:\n\nAnd it\u2019s very satisfying that today I can go immediately from, say, an image\nin the online version of the book, to the notebook that created it (and the\nstability of the Wolfram Language means that I can immediately run the code in\nthe notebook again\u2014though sometimes it can now be written in a more\nstreamlined way).\n\nThe sections of the book are basically laid out in the NewScience/Book/Layout/\nfolder of my \u201cthird-generation\u201d filesystem. Another part of that filesystem is\nNewScience/BookResearch/Topics. And in this folder are about 60 subfolders\nnamed for broad topics that I studied while working on the book. Within each\nof these folders are then further subfolders for particular projects I did\nwhile studying those topics\u2014which often then turned into particular sections\nor notes in the book.\n\nSome of my thinking about computer filesystems derives from my experience in\nthe 1970s and 1980s with physical filesystems. Back when I was a teenager\ndoing physics I voraciously made photocopies of papers. And at first I thought\nthe best way to file these papers would be in lots of different categories,\nwith each category stored in a different physical file folder. I thought hard\nabout the categories, often feeling quite pleased with the cleverness of\nassociating a particular paper with a particular category. And I had the\nprinciple that if too many papers accumulated in one category, I should break\nit up into new categories.\n\nAll this at first seemed like a good idea. But fairly quickly I realized it\nwasn\u2019t. Because too often when I wanted to find a particular paper I couldn\u2019t\nfigure out just what cleverness had caused me to associate it with what\ncategory. And the result was that I completely changed my approach. Instead of\ninsisting on narrow categories, I allowed broad, general categories\u2014with the\nresult that I could easily have 50 or more papers filed in a single category\n(often ending up with multiple well-stuffed physical file folders for a given\ncategory):\n\nAnd, yes, that meant that I would sometimes have to leaf through 50 papers or\nmore to find one I wanted. But realistically this wouldn\u2019t take more than a\nfew minutes. And even if it happened several times a day it was still a huge\nwin, because it meant that I could actually successfully find the things I\nwanted.\n\nI have pretty much the same principle about some parts of my computer\nfilesystem today. For example, when I\u2019m collecting research about some topic,\nI\u2019ll just toss all of it into a folder named for that topic. Sometimes I\u2019ll\neven do this for years. Then when I\u2019m ready to work on that topic, I\u2019ll go\nthrough the folder and pick out what I want.\n\nThese days my filesystem is broken into an active part (that I continuously\nsync onto all my computers), and a more archival part, that I keep on a\ncentral fileserver (and that, for example, contains my older-generation\nfilesystems).\n\nThere are only a few top-level folders in my active filesystem. One is called\nEvents. Its subfolders are years. And within each year I\u2019ll have a folder for\neach of the outside events I go to in that year. In that folder I\u2019ll store\nmaterial about the event, notebooks I used for talks there, notes I made at\nthe event, etc. Since in a given year I won\u2019t go to more than, maybe, 50\nevents, it\u2019s easy to scan through the Events folder for a given year, and find\nthe folder for a particular event.\n\nAnother top-level folder is called Designs. It contains all my notes about my\ndesign work on the Wolfram Language and other things we\u2019re building. Right now\nthere are about 150 folders about different active areas of design. But\nthere\u2019s also a folder called ARCHIVES, which contains folders about earlier\nareas that are no longer active.\n\nAnd in fact this is a general principle in the project-oriented parts of my\nfilesystem. Every folder has a subfolder called ARCHIVES. I try to make sure\nthat the files (or subfolders) in the main folder are always somehow active or\npending; anything that\u2019s finished with I put in ARCHIVES. (I put the name in\ncapitals so it stands out in directory listings.)\n\nFor most projects I\u2019ll never look at anything in ARCHIVES again. But of course\nit\u2019s easy to do so if I want to. And the fact that it\u2019s easy is important,\nbecause it means I don\u2019t have nagging concerns about saying \u201cthis is finished\nwith; let\u2019s put it in ARCHIVES\u201d, even if I think there\u2019s some chance it might\nbecome active again.\n\nAs it happens, this approach is somewhat inspired by something I saw done with\nphysical documents. When I was consulting at Bell Labs in the early 1980s I\nsaw that a friend of mine had two garbage cans in his office. When I asked him\nwhy, he explained that one was for genuine garbage and the other was a buffer\ninto which he would throw documents that he thought he\u2019d probably never want\nagain. He\u2019d let the buffer garbage can fill up, and once it was full, he\u2019d\nthrow away the lower documents in it, since from the fact that he hadn\u2019t\nfished them out, he figured he\u2019d probably never miss them if they were thrown\naway permanently.\n\nNeedless to say, I don\u2019t follow exactly this approach, and in fact I keep\neverything, digital or paper. But the point is that the ARCHIVES mechanism\ngives me a way to easily keep material while still making it easy to see\neverything that\u2019s active.\n\nI have a bunch of other conventions too. When I\u2019m doing designs, I\u2019ll\ntypically keep my notes in files with names like Notes-01.nb or SWNotes-01.nb.\nIt\u2019s like my principle of not having too many file categories: I don\u2019t tend to\ntry to categorize different parts of the design. I just sequentially number my\nfiles, because typically it\u2019ll be the most recent\u2014or most recent few\u2014that are\nthe most relevant when I continue with a particular design. And if the files\nare just numbered sequentially, it\u2019s easy to find them; one\u2019s not trying to\nremember what name one happened to give to some particular direction or idea.\n\nA long time ago I started always naming my sequential files file-01, file-02,\netc. That way pretty much any sorting scheme will sort the files in sequence.\nAnd, yes, I do often get to file-10, etc. But in all these years I have yet to\nget even close to file-99.\n\n## Knowing Where to Put Everything\n\nWhen I\u2019m specifically working on a particular project, I\u2019ll usually just be\nusing files in the folder associated with that project. But on a good day,\nI\u2019ll have lots of ideas about lots of different projects. And I also get\nhundreds of emails every day, relevant to all sorts of different projects. But\noften it\u2019ll be months or years before I\u2019m finally ready to seriously\nconcentrate on one of these other projects. So what I want to do is to store\nthe material I accumulate in such a way that even long in the future I can\nreadily find it.\n\nFor me, there are typically two dimensions to where something should be\nstored. The first is (not surprisingly) the content of what it\u2019s about. But\nthe second is the type of project in which I might use it. Is it going to be\nrelevant to some feature of some product? Is it going to be raw material for\nsome piece I write? Is it a seed for a student project, say at our annual\nSummer School? And so on.\n\nFor some types of projects, the material I\u2019m storing typically consists of a\nwhole file, or several files. For others, I just need to store an idea which\ncan be summarized in a few words or paragraphs. So, for example, the seed for\na student project is typically just an idea, that I can describe with a title,\nand perhaps a few lines of explanation. And in any given year I just keep\nadding such project ideas to a single notebook\u2014which, for example, I\u2019ll look\nat\u2014and summarize\u2014right before our annual summer programs.\n\nFor pieces like this that I\u2019m potentially going to write, it\u2019s a little\ndifferent. At any given time, there are perhaps 50 pieces that I\u2019m considering\nat some point writing. And what I do is to create a folder for each of them.\nEach will typically have files with names like Notes-01.nb, into which I\naccumulate specific ideas. But then the folder will also contain complete\nfiles, or groups of files, that I accumulate about the topic of the piece.\n(Sometimes I\u2019ll organize these into subfolders, with names like Explorations\nand Materials.)\n\nIn my filesystem, I have folders for different types of projects: Writings,\nDesigns, StudentProjects, etc. I find it important to have only a modest\nnumber of such folders (even with my fairly complex life, not much more than a\ndozen). When something comes in\u2014say from a piece of email, or from a\nconversation, or from something I see on the web, or just from an idea I\nhave\u2014I need to be able to quickly figure out what type of project (if any) it\nmight be relevant to.\n\nAt some level it\u2019s as simple as \u201cwhat file should I put it into\u201d? But the key\npoint is to have a pre-existing structure that makes it quick to decide\nthat\u2014and then to have this structure be one in which I can readily find things\neven far into the future.\n\nThere are plenty of tricky issues. Particularly if years go by, the way one\nnames or thinks about a topic may change. And sometimes that means at some\npoint I\u2019ll just rename a folder or some such. But the crucial thing as far as\nI\u2019m concerned is that at any given time the total number of folders into which\nI\u2019m actively putting things is small enough that I can basically remember all\nof them. I might have a dozen folders for different types of projects. Then\nsome of these will need subfolders for specific projects about specific\ntopics. But I try to limit the total number of \u201cactive accumulation folders\u201d\nto at most a few hundred.\n\nSome of those \u201caccumulation folders\u201d I\u2019ve had for a decade or more. A few will\ncome into existence and be gone within a few months. But most will last at\nmost a few years\u2014basically the time between when I conceptualize a project,\nand when the project is, for practical purposes, finished.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but I end up maintaining two hierarchies of folders. The\nfirst, and most important, is in my filesystem. But the second is in my email.\nThere are two basic reasons I maintain material in email folders. The first is\nimmediate convenience. Some piece of mail comes in and I think \u201cthat\u2019s\nrelevant to such-and-such a project that I\u2019m planning to do\u201d\u2014and I want to\nstore it in an appropriate place. Well, if that place is a mail folder, all I\nhave to do is move the mail with one mouse motion (or maybe with one press of\na Touch Bar button). I don\u2019t have to, for example, find a file or filesystem\nfolder to put it into.\n\nThere\u2019s also another reason it\u2019s good to leave mail as mail: threading. In the\nWolfram Language we\u2019ve now got capabilities both for importing mailboxes, and\nfor connecting to live mail servers. And one of the things one quickly sees is\nhow complicated the graphs (actually, hypergraphs) of email conversations can\nbe. Mail clients certainly aren\u2019t perfect as a way to view these\nconversations, but it\u2019s a lot better to use one than, say, to have a\ncollection of separate files.\n\nWhen projects are fairly well defined, but aren\u2019t yet very active, I tend to\nuse filesystem folders rather than email folders. Typically what will be\ncoming in about these projects are fairly isolated (and non-threaded) pieces\nof mail. And I find it best either just to drag those pieces of mail into\nappropriate project folders, or to copy out their contents and add them to\nnotebooks.\n\nWhen a project is very active, there may be lots of mail coming in about it,\nand it\u2019s important to preserve the threading structure. And when a project\nisn\u2019t yet so well defined, I just want to throw everything about it into a\nsingle \u201cbucket\u201d, and not have to think about organizing it into subfolders,\nnotebooks, etc.\n\nIf I look at my mail folders, I see many that parallel folders in my\nfilesystem. But I see some that do not, particularly related to longer-term\nproject concepts. And I have many such folders that have been there for well\nover a decade (my current overall mail folder organization is about 15 years\nold). Sometimes their names aren\u2019t perfect. But there are few enough folders,\nand I\u2019ve seen them for long enough, that I have a sense of what I\u2019m filing in\nthem, even though their names don\u2019t quite capture it.\n\nIt\u2019s always very satisfying when I\u2019m ready to work on a project, and I open\nthe mail folder for it, and start going through messages, often from long ago.\nJust in the past few weeks, as we wrap up a major new version of the Wolfram\nLanguage, I\u2019m starting to look ahead, and I\u2019ve been going through folders with\nmessages from 2005, and so on. When I saved those messages, I didn\u2019t yet have\na definite framework for the project they\u2019re about. But now I do. So when I go\nthrough the messages I can quickly put them into the appropriate active\nnotebooks and so on. Then I delete the messages from the mail folder, and\neventually, once it is empty, delete the whole mail folder. (Unlike with\nfiles, I don\u2019t find it useful to have an ARCHIVES folder for mail; the mail is\njust too voluminous and not organized enough, so to find any particular item\nI\u2019ll probably end up having to search for it anyway, and of course I certainly\nhave all of my mail stored.)\n\nOK, so I have my filesystem, and I have mail. At our company we also have an\nextensive project management system, as well as all sorts of databases,\nrequest trackers, source control systems, etc. Mostly the nature of my current\nwork does not cause me to interact directly with these, and I don\u2019t explicitly\nstore my own personal output in them. At different times, and with different\nprojects, I have done so. But right now my interaction with these systems is\nbasically only as a viewer, not an author.\n\nBeyond these systems, there are lots of things that I interact with basically\nthrough webpages. These might be public sites like wolframalpha.com or\nwolfram.com. They might be internal sites at our company. And they might be\npreliminary (say, \u201ctest\u201d or \u201cdevel\u201d) versions of what will in the future be\npublic websites or web-based services. I have a personal homepage that gives\nme convenient access to all these things:\n\nThe source for the homepage is (needless to say) a Wolfram Notebook. I can\nedit this notebook in my filesystem, then press a button to deploy a version\nto the Wolfram Cloud. I\u2019ve got an extension in my web browser so that every\ntime I create a new browser window or tab, the initial content will be my\npersonal homepage.\n\nAnd when I\u2019m going to start doing something, there are just a few places I go.\nOne is this web homepage, which I access many hundreds of times every day.\nAnother is my email and its folders. Another is my desktop filesystem. And\nbasically the only other one of any significance is my calendar system.\n\nFrom time to time, I\u2019ll see other people\u2019s computers, and their desktops will\nbe full of files. My desktop is completely empty, and plain white (convenient\nfor whole-screen screensharing and livestreaming). I\u2019d be mortified if there\nwere any files to be seen on my desktop. I\u2019d consider it a sign of defeat in\nmy effort to keep what I\u2019m doing organized. The same can be said of generic\nfolders like Documents and Downloads. Yes, in some situations applications\netc. will put files there. But I consider these directories to be throwaways.\nNothing in them do I intend to be part of my long-term organizational\nstructure. And they\u2019re not synched to the cloud, or across my different\ncomputers.\n\nWhatever the organization of my files may be, one feature of them is that I\nkeep them a long time. In fact, my oldest file dates are from 1980. Back then,\nthere was something a bit like the cloud, except it was called timesharing.\nI\u2019ve actually lost some of the files that I had on timesharing systems. But\nthe ones I had on on-premise computers are still with me (though, to be fair,\nsome had to be retrieved from 9-track backup tapes).\n\nAnd today, I make a point of having all my files (and all my email) actively\nstored on-premise. And, yes, that means I have this in my basement:\n\nThe initial storage is on a standard RAID disk array. This is backed up to\ncomputers at my company headquarters (about 1000 miles away), where standard\ntape backups are done. (In all these years, I\u2019ve only ever had to retrieve\nfrom a backup tape once.) I also sync my more active files to the cloud, and\nto all my various computers.\n\n## All the Little Conveniences\n\nMy major two personal forms of output are mail messages and Wolfram Notebooks.\nAnd over the 30 years since we first introduced notebooks we\u2019ve optimized our\nnotebook system to the point where I can just press a key to create a default\nnew notebook, and then I\u2019m immediately off and running writing what\nautomatically becomes a good-looking structured document. (And, by the way,\nit\u2019s very nice to see that we\u2019ve successfully maintained compatibility for 30\nyears: notebooks I created back in 1988 still just work.)\n\nSometimes, however, I\u2019m making a notebook that\u2019s not so much for human\nconsumption as for input to some automated process. And for this, I use a\nwhole variety of specially set up notebooks. For example, if I want to create\nan entry in our new Wolfram Function Repository, I just go to the menu item\n(available in any Version 12 system) File > New > Repository Item > Function\nRepository Item:\n\nThis effectively \u201cprompts\u201d me for items and sections to add. When I\u2019m done, I\ncan press Submit to Repository to send the notebook off to our central queue\nfor repository item reviews (and, just because I\u2019m the CEO doesn\u2019t mean I get\nout of the review process\u2014or want to).\n\nI actually create a fair amount of content that\u2019s structured for further\nprocessing. A big category is Wolfram Language documentation. And for\nauthoring this we have an internal system we call DocuTools, that\u2019s all based\non a giant palette developed over many years, that I often say reminds one of\nan airplane cockpit in its complexity:\n\nThe idea of DocuTools is to make it as ergonomic as possible to author\ndocumentation. It has more than 50 subpalettes (a few shown above), and\naltogether no less than 1016 buttons. If I want to start a new page for a\nWolfram Language function I just press New Function Page, and up pops:\n\nA very important part of this page is the stripe at the top that says\n\u201cFuture\u201d. This means that even though the page will be stored in our source\ncontrol system, it\u2019s not ready yet: it\u2019s just something we\u2019re considering for\nthe future. And the system that builds our official documentation will ignore\nthe page.\n\nUsually we (which quite often actually means me) will write documentation for\na function before the function is implemented. And we\u2019ll include all sorts of\ndetails about features the function should have. But when the function is\nactually first implemented, some of those features may not be ready yet. And\nto deal with this we (as we call it) \u201cfuturize\u201d parts of the documentation,\ngiving it a very visible pink background. It\u2019s still there in the source\ncontrol system, and we see it every time we look at the source for the\ndocumentation page. But it\u2019s not included when the page for documentation that\npeople will see is built.\n\nDocuTools is of course implemented in the Wolfram Language, making extensive\nuse of the symbolic structure of Wolfram Notebooks. And over the years it\u2019s\ngrown to handle many things that aren\u2019t strictly documentation; in fact, for\nme it\u2019s become the main hub for the creation of almost all notebook-based\ncontent.\n\nThere\u2019s a button, for example, for Stephen Wolfram Blog. Press it and one gets\na standard notebook ready to write into. But in DocuTools there\u2019s a whole\narray of buttons that allow one to insert suggestions and edits. And when I\u2019ve\nwritten a blog what will come back is typically something like this:\n\nThe pink boxes are \u201cyou really need to fix this\u201d; the tan are \u201chere\u2019s a\ncomment\u201d. Click one and up comes a little form:\n\nOf course, there are plenty of change-tracking and redlining systems out there\nin the world. But with the Wolfram Language it becomes easy to create a custom\none that\u2019s optimized for my needs, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve had done. Before I had\nthis, it used to take many hours to go through edit suggestions (I remember a\nhorrifying 17-hour plane ride where I spent almost the whole time going\nthrough suggestions for a single post). But now\u2014because it\u2019s all optimized for\nme\u2014I can zip through perhaps 10 times faster.\n\nVery often tools that are custom built for me end up being adapted so everyone\nelse can use them too. An example is a system for authoring courses and\ncreating videos. I wanted to be able to do this as a \u201cone-man band\u201d\u2014a bit like\nhow I do livestreaming. My idea was to create a script that contains both\nwords to say and code to input, then to make the video by screen recording in\nreal time while I went through the script. But how would the inputs work? I\ncouldn\u2019t type them by hand because it would interrupt the real-time flow of\nwhat I was saying. But the obvious thing is just to \u201cautotype\u201d them directly\ninto a notebook.\n\nBut how should all this be orchestrated? I start from a script:\n\nThen I press Generate Recording Configuration. Immediately a title screen\ncomes up in one area of my screen, and I set up my screen-recording system to\nrecord from this area. Elsewhere on my screen is the script. But what about\nthe controls? Well, they\u2019re just another Wolfram Notebook, that happens to act\nas a palette containing buttons:\n\nBut how can I actually operate this palette? I can\u2019t use my mouse, because\nthen I\u2019d take focus away from the notebook that\u2019s being screen recorded. So\nthe idea that I had is to put the palette on an extended desktop, that happens\nto be being displayed on an iPad. So then to \u201cperform\u201d the script, I just\npress buttons on the palette.\n\nThere\u2019s a big Advance Script button. And let\u2019s say I\u2019ve read to a point in the\nscript where I need to type something into the notebook. If I want to simulate\nactual typing I press Slow Type. This will enter the input character-at-a-time\ninto the notebook (yes, we measured the inter-key delay distribution for human\ntyping, and simulate it). After a while it gets annoying to see all that slow\ntyping. So then I just use the Type button, which copies the whole input\nimmediately into the notebook. If I press the button again, it\u2019ll perform its\nsecond action: Evaluate. And that\u2019s the equivalent of pressing Shift+Enter in\nthe notebook (with some optional extra explanatory popups suitable for the\nvideo).\n\nI could go on about other tools I\u2019ve had built using the Wolfram Language, but\nthis gives a flavor. But what do I use that isn\u2019t Wolfram Language? Well, I\nuse a web browser, and things that can be reached through it. Still, quite\noften, I\u2019m just going to the Wolfram Cloud, and for example viewing or using\ncloud notebooks there.\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll use our public Wolfram Cloud. But more often I\u2019ll use a private\nWolfram Cloud. The agendas for most of our internal meetings are notebooks\nthat are hosted on our internal Wolfram Cloud. I also personally have a local\nprivate Wolfram Cloud running, that I host an increasing number of\napplications on.\n\nHere\u2019s the dock on my computer as of right now:\n\nIt\u2019s got a filesystem browser; it\u2019s got an email client; it\u2019s got three web\nbrowsers (yes, I like to test our stuff on multiple browsers). Then I\u2019ve got a\ncalendar client. Next is the client for our VoIP phone system (right now I\u2019m\nalternating between using this, and using audio along with our screensharing\nsystem). Then, yes, at least right now I have a music app. I have to say it\u2019s\nrather rare that my day gives me a chance to listen to music. Probably the\nmain time when I end up doing it is when I\u2019m very behind on email, and need\nsomething to cheer me up as I grind through thousands of messages. As soon as\nI\u2019m actually writing anything nontrivial, though, I have to pause the music,\nor I can\u2019t concentrate. (And I have to find music without vocals\u2014because I\u2019ve\nnoticed I can\u2019t read at full speed if I\u2019m hearing vocals.)\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll end up launching a standard word processor, spreadsheet, etc.\napp because I\u2019m opening a document associated with one of these apps. But I\nhave to admit that in all these years I\u2019ve essentially never authored a\ndocument from scratch with any of these apps; I end up just using technology\nof ours instead.\n\nOccasionally I\u2019ll open a terminal window, and directly use operating system\ncommands. But this is becoming less and less common\u2014because more and more I\u2019m\njust using the Wolfram Language as my \u201csuper shell\u201d. (And, yes, it\u2019s\nincredibly convenient to store and edit commands in a notebook, and to\ninstantly be able to produce graphical and structured output.)\n\nAs I write this, I realize a little optimization I haven\u2019t yet made. On my\npersonal homepage there are some links that do fairly complex things. One, for\nexample, initiates the process for me doing an unscheduled livestream: it\nmessages our 24/7 system monitoring team so they can take my feed, broadcast\nit, and monitor responses. But I realize that I still have quite a few custom\noperating system commands, that do things like update from the source code\nrepository, that I type into a terminal window. I need to set these up in my\nprivate cloud, so I can just have links on my personal homepage that run\nWolfram Language code for these commands. (To be fair, some of these commands\nare very old; for example, my fmail command that sends a mail message in the\nfuture, was written nearly 30 years ago.)\n\nBut, OK, if I look at my dock of apps, there\u2019s a definite preponderance of\nSpikey ones. But why, for example, do I need three identical standard Spikeys?\nThey\u2019re all the Wolfram Desktop app. But there are three versions of it. The\nfirst one is our latest distributed version. The second one is our latest\ninternal version, normally updated every day. And the third one (which is in\nwhite) is our \u201cprototype build\u201d, also updated every day, but with lots of\n\u201cbleeding edge\u201d features that aren\u2019t ready to go into serious testing.\n\nIt requires surprisingly fancy operating system footwork to get these\ndifferent versions installed every night, and to correctly register document\ntypes with them. But it\u2019s very important to my personal workflow. Typically\nI\u2019ll use the latest internal version (and, yes, I have a directory with many\nprevious versions too), but occasionally, say for some particular meeting,\nI\u2019ll try out the prototype build, or I\u2019ll revert to the released build,\nbecause things are broken. (Dealing with multiple versions is one of those\nthings that\u2019s easier in the cloud\u2014and we have a whole array of different\nconfigurations running in internal private clouds, with all sorts of\ncombinations of kernel, front end, and other versions.)\n\nWhen I give talks and so on, I almost always use the latest internal version.\nI find that livecoding in front of an audience is a great way to find\nbugs\u2014even if it sometimes makes me have to explain, as I put it, the \u201cdisease\nof the software company CEO\u201d: to always want to be running the latest version,\neven if it hasn\u2019t been seriously tested and was built the night before.\n\n## Archiving & Searching\n\nA critical part of my personal infrastructure is something that in effect\ndramatically extends my personal memory: my \u201cmetasearcher\u201d. At the top of my\npersonal homepage is a search box. Type in something like \u201crhinoceros\nelephant\u201d and I\u2019ll immediately find every email I\u2019ve sent or received in the\npast 30 years in which that\u2019s appeared, as well as every file on my machine,\nand every paper document in my archives:\n\nTo me it\u2019s extremely convenient to have a count of the messages by year; it\noften helps me remember the history or story behind whatever I\u2019m asking. (In\nthis case, I can see a peak in 2008, which is when we were getting ready to\nlaunch Wolfram|Alpha\u2014and I was working on data about lots of kinds of things,\nincluding species.)\n\nOf course, a critical piece of making my metasearcher work is that I\u2019ve stored\nso much stuff. For example, I actually have all the 815,000 or so emails that\nI\u2019ve written in the past 30 years, and all the 2.3 million (mostly non-spam)\nones I\u2019ve received. And, yes, it helps tremendously that I\u2019ve had a company\nwith organized IT infrastructure etc. for the past 32 years.\n\nBut email, of course, has the nice feature that it\u2019s \u201cborn digital\u201d. What\nabout things that were, for example, originally on paper? Well, I have been\nsomething of an \u201cinformational packrat\u201d for most of my life. And in fact I\u2019ve\nbeen pretty consistently keeping documents back to when I started elementary\nschool in 1968. They\u2019ve been re-boxed three times since then, and now the main\nones are stored like this:\n\n(I also have file folder storage for documents on people, organizations,\nevents, projects and topics.) My rate of producing paper documents increased\nthrough about 1984, then decayed quite rapidly, as I went more digital.\nAltogether I have about a quarter million pages of primary non-bulk-printed\ndocuments\u2014mostly from the earlier parts of my life.\n\nAbout 15 years ago I decided I needed to make these searchable, so I initiated\nthe project of scanning all of them. Most of the documents are one or a few\npages in length, so they can\u2019t be handled by an automatic feeder\u2014and so we set\nup a rig with a high-resolution camera (and in those days it needed flash). It\ntook several person-years of work, but eventually all the documents were\nscanned.\n\nWe automatically cropped and white-balanced them (using Wolfram Language image\nprocessing), then OCR\u2019ed them, and put the OCR\u2019ed text as a transparent layer\ninto the scanned image. If I now search for \u201crhinoceros\u201d I find 8 documents in\nmy archive. Perhaps not surprisingly given that search term, they\u2019re a bit\nrandom, including for example the issue of my elementary school magazine from\nEaster 1971.\n\nOCR works on printed text. But what about handwritten text? Correspondence,\neven if it\u2019s handwritten, usually at least comes on printed letterhead. But I\nhave many pages of handwritten notes with basically nothing printed on them.\nRecognizing handwriting purely from images (without the time series of\nstrokes) is still beyond current technology, but I\u2019m hoping that our neural-\nnet-based machine learning systems will soon be able to tackle it.\n(Conveniently, I\u2019ve got quite a few documents where I have both my handwritten\ndraft, and a typed version, so I\u2019m hoping to have a training set for at least\nmy personal handwriting.)\n\nBut even though I can\u2019t search for handwritten material, I can often find it\njust by \u201clooking in the right box\u201d. My primary scanned documents are organized\ninto 140 or so boxes, each covering a major period or project in my life. And\nfor each box, I can pull up thumbnails of pages, grouped into documents. So,\nfor example, here are school geography notes from when I was 11 years old,\ntogether with the text of a speech I gave:\n\nI have to say that pretty much whenever I start looking through my scanned\ndocuments from decades ago I end up finding something unexpected and\ninteresting, that very often teaches me something about myself, and about how\nI ended up developing in some particular direction.\n\nIt may be something fairly specific to my life, and the fact that I\u2019ve worked\non building long-term things, as well as that I\u2019ve kept in touch with a large\nnumber of people over a long period of time, but I\u2019m amazed by the amount of\neven quite ancient personal history that I seem to encounter practically every\nday. Some person or some organization will contact me, and I\u2019ll look back at\ninformation about interactions I had with them 35 years ago. Or I\u2019ll be\nthinking about something, and I\u2019ll vaguely remember that I worked on something\nsimilar 25 years ago, and look back at what I did. I happen to have a pretty\ngood memory, but when I actually look at material from the past I\u2019m always\namazed at how many details I\u2019ve personally forgotten.\n\nI first got my metasearcher set up nearly 30 years ago. The current version is\nbased on Wolfram Language CreateSearchIndex/TextSearch functionality, running\non my personal private cloud. It\u2019s using UpdateSearchIndex to update every few\nminutes. The metasearcher also \u201cfederates in\u201d results from APIs for searching\nour corporate websites and databases.\n\nBut not everything I want can readily be found by search. And another\nmechanism I have for finding things is my \u201cpersonal timeline\u201d. I\u2019ve been\nmeaning for ages to extend this, but right now it basically just contains\ninformation on my external events, about 40 of them per year. And the most\nimportant part is typically my \u201cpersonal trip report\u201d, which I meticulously\nwrite, if at all possible within 24 hours.\n\nUsually the trip report is just text (or at least, text structured in a\nnotebook). But when I go to events like trade shows I typically bring a tiny\ncamera with me, that takes a picture every half-minute. If I\u2019m wearing one of\nthose lanyard name tags I\u2019ll typically clip the camera on the top of the name\ntag, among other things putting it at an ideal height to capture name tags of\npeople I meet. When I write my personal trip report I\u2019ll typically review the\npictures, and sometimes copy a few into my trip notebook.\n\nBut even with all my various current sources of archival material (which now\ninclude chat messages, livestreams, etc.), email still remains the most\nimportant. Years ago I decided to make it easy for people to find an email\naddress for me. My calculation was that if someone wants to reach me, then in\nmodern times they\u2019ll eventually find a way to do it, but if it\u2019s easy for them\njust to send email, that\u2019s how they\u2019ll contact me. And, yes, having my email\naddress out there means I get lots of email from people I don\u2019t know around\nthe world. Some of it is admittedly strange, but a lot is interesting. I try\nto look at all of it, but it\u2019s also sent to a request tracker system, so my\nstaff can make sure important things get handled. (It is sometimes a little\nodd for people to see request tracker ticket metadata like SWCOR #669140 in\nemail subject lines, but I figure it\u2019s a small price to pay for making sure\nthe email is actually responded to.)\n\nI might mention that for decades email has been the primary means of\ncommunication inside our (geographically distributed) company. Yes, we have\nproject management, source control, CRM and other systems, as well as chat.\nBut at least for the parts of the company that I interact with, email is\noverwhelmingly dominant. Sometimes it\u2019s individual emails being sent between\npeople. Sometimes it\u2019s email groups.\n\nIt\u2019s been a running joke for a long time that we have more email groups than\nemployees. But we\u2019ve been careful to organize the groups, for example\nidentifying different types by prefixes to their names (t- is a mailing list\nfor a project team, d- a mailing list for a department, l- a more open mailing\nlist, r- a mailing list for automated reports, q- a request list, etc.) And\nfor me at least this makes it plausible to remember what the right list is for\nsome mail I want to send out.\n\n## Databases of People & Things\n\nI know a lot of people, from many different parts of my life. Back in the\n1980s I used to just keep a list of them in a text file (before then it was a\nhandwritten address book). But by the 1990s I decided I needed to have a more\nsystematic database for myself\u2014and created what I started calling pBase. In\nrecent years the original technology of pBase began to seem quite paleolithic,\nbut I now have a modern implementation using the Wolfram Language running in\nmy personal private cloud.\n\nIt\u2019s all quite nice. I can search for people by name or attributes, or\u2014if I\u2019m\nfor example going to be visiting somewhere\u2014I can just have pBase show me a map\nof our latest information about who\u2019s nearby:\n\nHow does pBase relate to social networks? I\u2019ve had a Facebook account for a\nlong time, but it\u2019s poorly curated, and always seems to ride at the maximum\nnumber of possible friends. LinkedIn I take much more seriously, and make a\npoint of adding people only if I\u2019ve actually talked to them (I currently have\n3005 connections, so, yes, I\u2019ve talked to quite a few people).\n\nIt\u2019s very convenient that every so often I can download data from my LinkedIn\naccount via ServiceExecute to update what\u2019s in pBase. But LinkedIn captures\nonly a fraction of people I know. It doesn\u2019t include many of my more prominent\nfriends and acquaintances, as well as most academics, many students, etc.\n\nEventually I\u2019ll probably get pBase developed more, and perhaps make the\ntechnology generally available. But within our company, there\u2019s already a\nsystem that illustrates some potential aspirations: our internal company\ndirectory\u2014which is running in our internal private cloud, and basically uses\nWolfram|Alpha-style natural language understanding to let one ask natural\nlanguage questions.\n\nI might mention in addition to our company directory, we also maintain another\ndatabase that I, at least, find very useful, particularly when I\u2019m trying to\nfigure out who might know the answer to some unusual question, or who we might\ntap for some new project. We call it our Who Knows What database. And for each\nperson it gives a profile of experience and interests. Here\u2019s the entry for me\n(and here\u2019s the source with the question details):\n\nIn terms of personal databases, another useful one for me is the database of\nbooks I own. I haven\u2019t been buying too many books in the past decade or so,\nbut before then I accumulated a library of about 6000 volumes, and it\u2019s not\nuncommon\u2014particularly when I\u2019m doing more historically oriented research\u2014that\nI\u2019ll want to consult quite a few of them. But how should they be organized?\n\u201cBig\u201d classification schemes like Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress are\noverkill, and don\u2019t do a great job of matching my personal \u201ccognitive map\u201d of\ntopics.\n\nLike my filesystem folders, or my physical folders of papers, I\u2019ve found the\nbest scheme is to put the books into fairly broad categories\u2014small enough in\nnumber that I can spatially remember where they are in my library. But how\nshould books be arranged within a category?\n\nWell, here I get to tell a cautionary tale (that my wife regularly uses as an\nexample) of what can go wrong in my kind of approach. Always liking to\nunderstand the historical progression of ideas, I thought it would be nice to\nbe able to browse a category of books on a shelf in historical order (say, by\nfirst publication date). But this makes it difficult to find a specific book,\nor, for example, to reshelve it. (It would be easier if books had their\npublication dates printed on their spines. But they don\u2019t.)\n\nAbout 20 years ago I was preparing to move all my books to a new location,\nwith different lengths of shelves. And I had the issue of trying to map out\nhow to arrange book categories on the new shelves (\u201chow many linear feet is\nquantum field theory and where can it fit in?\u201d) So I thought: \u201cWhy not just\nmeasure the width of each book, and while I\u2019m at it also measure its height\nand its color?\u201d Because my idea was that then I could make a graphic of each\nshelf, with books shown with realistic widths and colors, then put an arrow in\nthe graphic to indicate the location (easily identified visually from\n\u201clandmarks\u201d of other books) of a particular book.\n\nI got a colorimeter (it was before ubiquitous digital cameras) and started\nhaving the measurements made. But it turned out to be vastly more labor-\nintensive than expected, and, needless to say, didn\u2019t get finished before the\nbooks had to be moved. Meanwhile, the day the books were moved, it was noticed\nthat the packing boxes fit more books if one didn\u2019t just take a single slab of\nbooks off a shelf, but instead put other books around the edges.\n\nThe result was that 5100 books arrived, basically scrambled into random order.\nIt took three days to sort them. And at this point, I decided just to keep\nthings simpler, and alphabetize by author in each category. And this certainly\nworks fine in finding books. But one result of my big book inventory project\nis that I do now have a nice, computable version of at least all the books\nconnected to writing A New Kind of Science, and it\u2019s actually in the Wolfram\nData Repository:\n\n\u2715\n\n    \n    \n    ResourceData[\"Books in Stephen Wolfram's Library\"]  \n  \n---  \n  \n## Personal Analytics\n\nIn 2012 I wrote a piece about personal analytics and the data I\u2019ve collected\non myself. Back then I had about a third of a million outgoing emails in my\narchive; now it\u2019s half a million more, and I can extend my diurnal plot of\nemail I\u2019ve sent:\n\n(The big empty spaces are when I\u2019m asleep, and, yes, as I\u2019ve changed\nprojects\u2014e.g. finishing A New Kind of Science in 2002\u2014my sleep habits have\nchanged; I\u2019m also now trying an experiment of going to sleep earlier.)\n\nI have systems that keep all sorts of data, including every keystroke I type,\nevery step I take and what my computer screen looks like every minute (sadly,\nthe movie of this is very dull). I also have a whole variety of medical and\nenvironmental sensors, as well as data from devices and systems that I\ninteract with.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting every so often to pick up those Wolfram Data Drop databins\nand use them to do some data science on my life. And, yes, in broad terms I\nfind that I am extremely consistent and habitual\u2014yet every day there are\ndifferent things that happen, that make my \u201cproductivity\u201d (as measured in a\nvariety of ways) bounce around, often seemingly randomly.\n\nBut one thing about collecting all this data is that I can use it to create\ndashboards, and these I find useful every single day. For example, running in\nmy private cloud is a monitoring system for my email:\n\nThe yellow curve is my total number of pending email messages; the red is the\nnumber I haven\u2019t even opened yet. These curves are pretty sensitive to all\nkinds of features of my life, and for example when I\u2019m intensely working on\nsome project, I\u2019ll often see my email \u201cgo to seed\u201d for a little while. But\nsomehow in trying to pace myself and decide when I can do what, I find this\nemail dashboard very helpful.\n\nIt\u2019s also helpful that every day I get emails reporting on the previous day.\nHow many keystrokes did I type, and in what applications? What files did I\ncreate? How many steps did I take? And so on.\n\nI keep all kinds of health and medical data on myself too, and have done so\nfor a long time. It\u2019s always great to have started measuring something a long\ntime ago, so one can plot a several-decade time series and see if anything\u2019s\nchanged. And, actually, the thing I\u2019ve noticed is that often my value (say\nblood level) for something has remained numerically essentially the same for\nyears\u2014but many of the \u201cnormal ranges\u201d quoted by labs have bounced all over the\nplace. (Realistically this isn\u2019t helped by labs inferring normal ranges from\ntheir particular observed populations, etc.)\n\nI got my whole genome sequenced in 2010. And although I haven\u2019t learned\nanything dramatic from it, it certainly helps me feel connected to genomic\nresearch when I can see some SNP variant mentioned in a paper, and I can\nimmediately go look to see if I have it. (With all the various vicissitudes of\nstrands, orientations and build numbers, I tend to stick to first principles,\nand just look for flanking sequences with StringPosition.)\n\nLike so many of the things I\u2019ve described in this piece, what has worked for\nme in doing personal analytics is to do what\u2019s easy to do. I\u2019ve never yet\nquite solved the problem, for example, of recording what I eat (our image\nidentification isn\u2019t yet quite good enough, and even made-just-for-me apps to\nenter food have always seemed a bit too onerous). But whenever I have a system\nthat just operates automatically, that\u2019s when I successfully collect good\npersonal analytics data. And having dashboards and daily emails helps both in\nproviding ongoing feedback, and in being able to check if something\u2019s gone\nwrong with the system.\n\n## The Path Ahead\n\nI\u2019ve described\u2014in arguably quite nerdy detail\u2014how some of my personal\ntechnology infrastructure is set up. It\u2019s always changing, and I\u2019m always\ntrying to update it\u2014and for example I seem to end up with lots of bins of\nthings I\u2019m not using anymore (yes, I get almost every \u201cinteresting\u201d new device\nor gadget that I find out about):\n\nBut although things like devices change, I\u2019ve found that the organizational\nprinciples for my infrastructure have remained surprisingly constant, just\ngradually getting more and more polished. And\u2014at least when they\u2019re based on\nour very stable Wolfram Language system\u2014I\u2019ve found that the same is true for\nthe software systems I\u2019ve had built to implement them.\n\nWhat of the future? Some things will certainly get upticked. I realized while\nwriting this piece that I can now upgrade to 4k monitors (or higher) without\naffecting screensharing (the feed is automatically downsampled). Before too\nlong maybe I\u2019ll be using AR to annotate my environment in real time. Maybe\neventually I\u2019ll have some way to do XR-based as-if-in-person\nvideoconferencing. Maybe\u2014as I\u2019ve been assuming will be possible for 40+\nyears\u2014I\u2019ll finally be able to type faster using something like EEG. And so on.\n\nBut the more important changes will be in having better-developed, and more\nautomated, workflows. In time I expect it\u2019ll be possible to use our machine\nlearning tools to do automatic \u201ccomputational history\u201d, for example assembling\na useful and appropriately clustered timeline of things I\u2019ve done, say in a\nparticular area.\n\nIn my efforts at historical research, I\u2019ve had occasion to use lots of\narchives of people and organizations. There\u2019s usually a certain amount of\nindexing and tagging that\u2019s been done. (Who is that letter to and from? When\nwas it written? What are its keywords? Where was it filed? And so on.) But\nthings tend to be very granular, and it\u2019s usually hard work to determine the\noverall arc of what happened.\n\nMy first goal is to make all the material I personally have useful for myself.\nBut I\u2019m thinking of soon starting to open up some of the older material for\nother people to see. And I\u2019m studying how\u2014in modern times, with all the cloud\ninfrastructure, machine learning, visualization, computational documents, etc.\nthat we have\u2014I can build the best possible system for presenting and exploring\narchives.\n\nAs I think about my day, I ask myself what aspects of it aren\u2019t well\noptimized. A lot of it actually comes down to things like email processing,\nand time spent for example actually responding to questions. Now, of course,\nI\u2019ve spent lots of effort to try to structure things so as many questions as\npossible become self-answering, or can be addressed with technology and\nautomation that we\u2019ve built. And, in my role as CEO, I also try hard to\ndelegate to other people whenever I can.\n\nBut there\u2019s still plenty left. And I certainly wonder whether with all the\ntechnology we now have, more could be automated, or delegated to machines.\nPerhaps all that data I\u2019ve collected on myself will one day let one basically\njust built a \u201cbot of me\u201d. Having seen so many of my emails\u2014and being able to\nlook at all my files and personal analytics\u2014maybe it\u2019s actually possible to\npredict how I\u2019d respond to any particular question.\n\nWe\u2019re not there yet. But it will be an interesting moment when a machine can,\nfor example, have three ideas about how to respond to something, and then show\nme drafts that I can just pick from and approve. The overall question of what\ndirection I want to go in will almost by definition have to stay with me, but\nthe details of how to get there I\u2019m hoping can increasingly be automated.\n\n### Product Details\n\nIn the course of this piece, I\u2019ve mentioned all sorts of devices and systems.\nHere\u2019s a list of the specific products I\u2019m currently using. Note that I\u2019m not\n\u201cendorsing\u201d things; I\u2019m just explaining what I happen to use, based on my\nresearch, and my particular constraints and history.\n\nI\u2019m listing items in the order they appear in this piece, usually not\nrepeating if they\u2019re mentioned multiple times.
