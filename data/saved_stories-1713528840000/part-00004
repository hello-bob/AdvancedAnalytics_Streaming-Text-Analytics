A storied history of high drama and thrilling racing on a\nmajestic challenge that sweeps and undulates with the landscape of the Mie\nprefecture where it is built. It is the perfect combination of risk and\nreward, where the bold and exacting shine but which has retained its fearsome\nreputation of being unforgiving of error. A classic and in the modern era, an\nold-school circuit indeed.\n\nSuzuka recently extended its contract with F1 until 2029, a decision widely\nwelcomed given the recent proliferation of anodyne street circuits. Max\nVerstappen made his F1 debut in practice here in 2014 having just turned 17.\nThe world champion\u2019s admiration is informed by there still being genuine\njeopardy at Suzuka.\n\nMax Verstappen continues qualifying dominance to take Japanese GP pole\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of my favourites,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite intimidating the\nfirst time you actually drive around the track, that\u2019s how I found it. Because\nit\u2019s so narrow, if you make a small mistake, you can go off in the grass or\ngravel. It just adds a bit more to it than some other tracks where you can run\nwide. So you definitely need to be really aware. If you push a bit more, you\nrisk a bit more that you can really go off and crash the car. That makes it\nvery special for me.\u201d\n\nThis season has felt like something of a rebirth for the revered figure-of-\neight track, which held its first Japanese GP in 1987, as it is the first time\nit has been used so early in the campaign. If it is not to be the season\u2019s\nconcluding meeting as it was on so many memorable occasions, with that honour\nnow seemingly forever in the iron grip of the petrodollars of the soulless Abu\nDhabi, then an early spot in the spring, with all to play for still in the\nchampionship and teams still feeling their way into a new season, is a worthy\nplace for this formidable and fascinating venue.\n\nAs if to mark the occasion, Sunday\u2019s race has coincided with cherry blossom \u2013\nthe Sakura \u2013 season, so along with the usual throngs of enthusiastic fans\nflooding into the track, pink and white flowers have peppered the surrounding\ncountryside of this largely rural, seaside area overlooking the Ise bay,\nvisible on a clear day looking down the slope into turns one and two.\n\nMcLaren driver Oscar Piastri in action with a view of cherry blossom in the\nbackground.

It is a decade since Jules Bianchi suffered the accident\nthat would ultimately cost him his life. He went off in heavy rain and poor\nvisibility at the quick Dunlop curve and hit the recovery vehicle that was\nremoving another car from the track. Bianchi would die from his injuries the\nfollowing year.\n\nFortunately F1 learned lessons from the tragedy and Sunday\u2019s race promises\nmuch because Suzuka is a circuit defined by its glorious corners. The Esses, a\nsweeping uphill sequence of four undulating bends with a slight banking that\ncan make or break a lap, the Degners, the Hairpin, Spoon and the fearsome\n130R, a left-hander taken with full commitment to test a car like perhaps no\nother, although turn one at Sebring is similarly gripping.\n\nNowadays it is perhaps easy to assume drivers enjoy the purpose\u2010built\nenormodromes with state-of-the-art facilities, but the reality is they are\nthrill junkies, as ever they have been, and those corners make for one hell of\na ride.\n\nDamon Hill (right) claimed a glorious victory in the wet against Michael\nSchumacher in 1994. Photograph: Paul-Henri Cahier/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s undulations, cambers, all things which race tracks have and city\ntracks don\u2019t really have any more,\u201d says Williams\u2019 Alex Albon. \u201cSuzuka is just\nuncompromising. There\u2019s really not much run-off, it\u2019s white lines and grass.\nSo you enjoy that as a driver to be able to feel that adrenaline when you\u2019re\ndriving and to know that to go quicker, you need to put a bit more on the\nline.\u201d\n\nLittle wonder, then, that the 3.6\u2010mile track has returned so many classic\nmoments. It was designed as a test circuit for Honda by the Dutchman John\nHugenholtz in 1962. His creation puts every aspect of driver and car under the\nspotlight and has fittingly gone on to provide the backdrop to some of the\ngrandest of F1 theatre.\n\nAlain Prost and Ayrton Senna go head to head during 1988\u2019s Japanese Grand Prix\nat Suzuka. Photograph: Paul-Henri Cahier/Getty Images\n\nThere was Ayrton Senna\u2019s comeback from 14th in 1988 after a stall at the\nstart, reeling Alain Prost back in to take the win and his first title. Then\nsubsequently their epic confrontations in 1989 and 1990, the latter attracting\nthree million entries for a draw for the 120,000 tickets on offer. Damon\nHill\u2019s win in the wet in 1994, a race he cites as his favourite, driving in\nterrible conditions on instinct alone to beat Michael Schumacher in the rain\nat one of the world\u2019s most demanding circuits.\n\nThen there was Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen\u2019s charge from 17th to victory in 2005. The\nFinn\u2019s finest moment? Well, it certainly is high on the list. The track simply\nseems to inspire more from the drivers. Long may it maintain its deserved\nplace as a jewel in Formula One\u2019s crown.\n\nThis article was amended on 7 April 2024 because an earlier version located\nthe Suzuka circuit in the Aichi prefecture whereas it is in the Mie\nprefecture.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Formula One\n  * The Observer\n  * Motor sport\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Football\n  * Cricket\n  * Rugby union\n  * Tennis\n  * Cycling\n  * F1\n  * Golf\n  * US sports\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
