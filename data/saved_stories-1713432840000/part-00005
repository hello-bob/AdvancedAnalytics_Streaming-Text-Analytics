It\u2019s worth keeping track of\nthe difference.\n\nBy Manvir Singh\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nRailing against social media for manipulating our zombie minds might just\ndistract us from our collective societal failures.Illustration by Till Lauer\n\nMillions of people have watched Mike Hughes die. It happened on February 22,\n2020, not far from Highway 247 near the Mojave Desert city of Barstow,\nCalifornia. A homemade rocket ship with Hughes strapped in it took off from a\nlaunching pad mounted on a truck. A trail of steam billowed behind the rocket\nas it swerved and then shot upward, a detached parachute unfurling ominously\nin its wake. In a video recorded by the journalist Justin Chapman, Hughes\ndisappears into the sky, a dark pinpoint in a vast, uncaring blueness. But\nthen the rocket reappears and hurtles toward the ground, crashing, after ten\nlong seconds, in a dusty cloud half a mile away.\n\nHughes was among the best-known proponents of Flat Earth theory, which insists\nthat our planet is not spherical but a Frisbee-like disk. He had built and\nflown in two rockets before, one in 2014 and another in 2018, and he planned\nto construct a \u201crockoon,\u201d a combination rocket and balloon, that would carry\nhim above the upper atmosphere, where he could see the Earth\u2019s flatness for\nhimself. The 2020 takeoff, staged for the Science Channel series \u201cHomemade\nAstronauts,\u201d was supposed to take him a mile up\u2014not high enough to see the\nEarth\u2019s curvature but hypeworthy enough to garner more funding and attention.\n\nFlat Earth theory may sound like one of those deliberately far-fetched\nsatires, akin to Birds Aren\u2019t Real, but it has become a cultic subject for\nanti-scientific conspiratorialists, growing entangled with movements such as\nQAnon and COVID-19 skepticism. In \u201cOff the Edge: Flat Earthers, Conspiracy\nCulture, and Why People Will Believe Anything\u201d (Algonquin), the former Daily\nBeast reporter Kelly Weill writes that the tragedy awakened her to the\nsincerity of Flat Earthers\u2019 convictions. After investigating the Flat Earth\nscene and following Hughes, she had figured that, \u201con some subconscious\nlevel,\u201d Hughes knew the Earth wasn\u2019t flat. His death set her straight: \u201cI was\nwrong. Flat Earthers are as serious as your life.\u201d\n\nWeill isn\u2019t the only one to fear the effects of false information. In January,\nthe World Economic Forum released a report showing that fourteen hundred and\nninety international experts rated \u201cmisinformation and disinformation\u201d the\nleading global risk of the next two years, surpassing war, migration, and\nclimatic catastrophe. A stack of new books echoes their concerns. In\n\u201cFalsehoods Fly: Why Misinformation Spreads and How to Stop It\u201d (Columbia),\nPaul Thagard, a philosopher at the University of Waterloo, writes that\n\u201cmisinformation is threatening medicine, science, politics, social justice,\nand international relations, affecting problems such as vaccine hesitancy,\nclimate change denial, conspiracy theories, claims of racial inferiority, and\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine.\u201d In \u201cFoolproof: Why Misinformation Infects\nOur Minds and How to Build Immunity\u201d (Norton), Sander van der Linden, a\nsocial-psychology professor at Cambridge, warns that \u201cviruses of the mind\u201d\ndisseminated by false tweets and misleading headlines pose \u201cserious threats to\nthe integrity of elections and democracies worldwide.\u201d Or, as the M.I.T.\npolitical scientist Adam J. Berinsky puts it in \u201cPolitical Rumors: Why We\nAccept Misinformation and How to Fight It\u201d (Princeton), \u201ca democracy where\nfalsehoods run rampant can only result in dysfunction.\u201d\n\nMost Americans seem to agree with these theorists of human credulity.\nFollowing the 2020 Presidential race, sixty per cent thought that\nmisinformation had a major impact on the outcome, and, to judge from a recent\nsurvey, even more believe that artificial intelligence will exacerbate the\nproblem in this year\u2019s contest. The Trump and the DeSantis campaigns both used\ndeepfakes to sully their rivals. Although they justified the fabrications as\ntransparent parodies, some experts anticipate a \u201ctsunami of misinformation,\u201d\nin the words of Oren Etzioni, a professor emeritus at the University of\nWashington and the first C.E.O. of the Allen Institute for Artificial\nIntelligence. \u201cThe ingredients are there, and I am completely terrified,\u201d he\ntold the Associated Press.\n\nThe fear of misinformation hinges on assumptions about human suggestibility.\n\u201cMisinformation, conspiracy theories, and other dangerous ideas, latch on to\nthe brain and insert themselves deep into our consciousness,\u201d van der Linden\nwrites in \u201cFoolproof.\u201d \u201cThey infiltrate our thoughts, feelings, and even our\nmemories.\u201d Thagard puts it more plainly: \u201cPeople have a natural tendency to\nbelieve what they hear or read, which amounts to gullibility.\u201d\n\nBut do the credulity theorists have the right account of what\u2019s going on?\nFolks like Mike Hughes aren\u2019t gullible in the sense that they\u2019ll believe\nanything. They seem to reject scientific consensus, after all. Partisans of\nother well-known conspiracies (the government is run by lizard people; a cabal\nof high-level pedophilic Democrats operates out of a neighborhood pizza\nparlor) are insusceptible to the assurances of the mainstream media. Have we\nbeen misinformed about the power of misinformation?\n\nIn 2006, more than five hundred skeptics met at an Embassy Suites hotel near\nO\u2019Hare Airport, in Chicago, to discuss conspiracy. They listened to\npresentations on mass hypnosis, the melting point of steel, and how to survive\nthe collapse of the existing world order. They called themselves many things,\nincluding \u201ctruth activists\u201d and \u201c9/11 skeptics,\u201d although the name that would\nstick, and which observers would use for years afterward, was Truthers.\n\nThe Truthers held that the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center\nwere masterminded by the White House to expand government power and enable\nmilitary and security industries to profit from the war on terror. According\nto an explanation posted by 911truth.org, a group that helped sponsor the\nconference, George W. Bush and his allies gagged and intimidated whistle-\nblowers, mailed anthrax to opponents in the Senate, and knowingly poisoned the\ninhabitants of lower Manhattan. On that basis, Truthers concluded, \u201cthe\nadministration does consider the lives of American citizens to be expendable\non behalf of certain interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of this dispute, a clear leader will emerge.\u201d\n\nCartoon by Frank Cotham\n\nLink copied\n\nThe Truthers, in short, maintained that the government had gone to extreme\nmeasures, including killing thousands of its own citizens, in order to carry\nout and cover up a conspiracy. And yet the same Truthers advertised the\nconference online and met in a place where they could easily be surveilled.\nSpeakers\u2019 names were posted on the Internet along with videos, photographs,\nand short bios. The organizers created a publicly accessible forum to discuss\nnext steps, and a couple of attendees spoke to a reporter from the Times,\ndespite the mainstream media\u2019s ostensible complicity in the coverup. By the\nlogic of their own theories, the Truthers were setting themselves up for\nassassination.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nAn Iranian Woman Finds Her Might, in \u201cThe Smallest Power\u201d\n\nTheir behavior demonstrates a paradox of belief. Action is supposed to follow\nbelief, and yet beliefs, even fervently espoused ones, sometimes exist in\ntheir own cognitive cage, with little influence over behavior. Take the\n\u201cPizzagate\u201d story, in which Hillary Clinton and her allies ran a child sex\nring from the basement of a D.C. pizzeria. In the months surrounding the 2016\nPresidential election, a staggering number of Americans\u2014millions, by some\nestimates\u2014endorsed the account, and, in December of that year, a North\nCarolina man charged into the restaurant, carrying an assault rifle. Van der\nLinden and Berinsky both use the incident as evidence of misinformation\u2019s\nviolent implications. But they\u2019re missing the point: what\u2019s really striking is\nhow anomalous that act was. The pizzeria received menacing phone calls, even\ndeath threats, but the most common response from believers, aside from liking\nposts, seems to have been leaving negative Yelp reviews.\n\nThat certain deeply held beliefs seem insulated from other inferences isn\u2019t\npeculiar to conspiracy theorists; it\u2019s the experience of regular churchgoers.\nCatholics maintain that the Sacrament is the body of Christ, yet no one\nexpects the bread to taste like raw flesh or accuses fellow-parishioners of\ncannibalism. In \u201cHow God Becomes Real\u201d (2020), the Stanford anthropologist T.\nM. Luhrmann recounts evangelical Christians\u2019 frustrations with their own\nbeliefs. They thought less about God when they were not in church. They\nconfessed to not praying. \u201cI remember a man weeping in front of a church over\nnot having sufficient faith that God would replace the job he had lost,\u201d\nLuhrmann writes. The paradox of belief is one of Christianity\u2019s \u201cclearest\u201d\nmessages, she observes: \u201cYou may think you believe in God, but really you\ndon\u2019t. You don\u2019t take God seriously enough. You don\u2019t act as if he\u2019s there.\u201d\nIt\u2019s right out of Mark 9:24: \u201cLord, I believe; help my unbelief!\u201d\n\nThe paradox of belief has been the subject of scholarly investigation;\npuzzling it out promises new insights about the human psyche. Some of the most\ninfluential work has been by the French philosopher and cognitive scientist\nDan Sperber. Born into a Jewish family in France in 1942, during the Nazi\nOccupation, Sperber was smuggled to Switzerland when he was three months old.\nHis parents returned to France three years later, and raised him as an atheist\nwhile imparting a respect for all religious-minded people, including his\nHasidic Jewish ancestors.\n\nThe exercise of finding rationality in the seemingly irrational became an\nacademic focus for Sperber in the nineteen-seventies. Staying with the Dorze\npeople in southern Ethiopia, he noticed that they made assertions that they\nseemed both to believe and not to believe. People told him, for example, that\n\u201cthe leopard is a Christian animal who observes the fasts of the Ethiopian\nOrthodox Church.\u201d Nevertheless, the average Dorze man guarded his livestock on\nfast days just as much as on other days. \u201cNot because he suspects some\nleopards of being bad Christians,\u201d Sperber wrote, \u201cbut because he takes it as\ntrue both that leopards fast and that they are always dangerous.\u201d\n\nSperber concluded that there are two kinds of beliefs. The first he has called\n\u201cfactual\u201d beliefs. Factual beliefs\u2014such as the belief that chairs exist and\nthat leopards are dangerous\u2014guide behavior and tolerate little inconsistency;\nyou can\u2019t believe that leopards do and do not eat livestock. The second\ncategory he has called \u201csymbolic\u201d beliefs. These beliefs might feel genuine,\nbut they\u2019re cordoned off from action and expectation. We are, in turn, much\nmore accepting of inconsistency when it comes to symbolic beliefs; we can\nbelieve, say, that God is all-powerful and good while allowing for the\nexistence of evil and suffering.\n\nIn a masterly new book, \u201cReligion as Make-Believe\u201d (Harvard), Neil Van\nLeeuwen, a philosopher at Georgia State University, returns to Sperber\u2019s ideas\nwith notable rigor. He analyzes beliefs with a taxonomist\u2019s care, classifying\ndifferent types and identifying the properties that distinguish them. He\nproposes that humans represent and use factual beliefs differently from\nsymbolic beliefs, which he terms \u201ccredences.\u201d Factual beliefs are for\nmodelling reality and behaving optimally within it. Because of their function\nin guiding action, they exhibit features like \u201cinvoluntariness\u201d (you can\u2019t\ndecide to adopt them) and \u201cevidential vulnerability\u201d (they respond to\nevidence). Symbolic beliefs, meanwhile, largely serve social ends, not\nepistemic ones, so we can hold them even in the face of contradictory\nevidence.\n\nOne of Van Leeuwen\u2019s insights is that people distinguish between different\ncategories of belief in everyday speech. We say we \u201cbelieve\u201d symbolic ones but\nthat we \u201cthink\u201d factual ones are true. He has run ingenious experiments\nshowing that you can manipulate how people talk about beliefs by changing the\nenvironment in which they\u2019re expressed or sustained. Tell participants that a\nwoman named Sheila sets up a shrine to Elvis Presley and plays songs on his\nbirthday, and they will more often say that she \u201cbelieves\u201d Elvis is alive. But\ntell them that Sheila went to study penguins in Antarctica in 1977, and missed\nthe news of his death, and they\u2019ll say she \u201cthinks\u201d he\u2019s still around. As the\nGerman sociologist Georg Simmel recognized more than a century ago, religious\nbeliefs seem to express commitments\u2014we believe in God the way we believe in a\nparent or a loved one, rather than the way we believe chairs exist. Perhaps\npeople who traffic in outlandish conspiracies don\u2019t so much believe them as\nbelieve in them.\n\nVan Leeuwen\u2019s book complements a 2020 volume by Hugo Mercier, \u201cNot Born\nYesterday.\u201d Mercier, a cognitive scientist at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure who\nstudied under Sperber, argues that worries about human gullibility overlook\nhow skilled we are at acquiring factual beliefs. Our understanding of reality\nmatters, he notes. Get it wrong, and the consequences can be disastrous. On\ntop of that, people have a selfish interest in manipulating one another. As a\nresult, human beings have evolved a tool kit of psychological adaptations for\nevaluating information\u2014what he calls \u201copen vigilance mechanisms.\u201d Where a\ncredulity theorist like Thagard insists that humans tend to believe anything,\nMercier shows that we are careful when adopting factual beliefs, and\ninstinctively assess the quality of information, especially by tracking the\nreliability of sources.\n\nVan Leeuwen and Mercier agree that many beliefs are not best interpreted as\nfactual ones, although they lay out different reasons for why this might be.\nFor Van Leeuwen, a major driver is group identity. Beliefs often function as\nbadges: the stranger and more unsubstantiated the better. Religions, he notes,\ndefine membership on the basis of unverifiable or even unintelligible beliefs:\nthat there is one God; that there is reincarnation; that this or that person\nwas a prophet; that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are separate yet\none. Mercier, in his work, has focussed more on justification. He says that we\nhave intuitions\u2014that vaccination is bad, for example, or that certain\npoliticians can\u2019t be trusted\u2014and then collect stories that defend our\npositions. Still, both authors treat symbolic beliefs as socially strategic\nexpressions.\n\nAfter Mike Hughes\u2019s death, a small debate broke out over the nature of his\nbelief. His publicist, Darren Shuster, said that Hughes never really believed\nin a flat Earth. \u201cIt was a P.R. stunt,\u201d he told Vice News. \u201cWe used the\nattention to get sponsorships and it kept working over and over again.\u201d\nSpace.com dug up an old interview corroborating Shuster\u2019s statements. \u201cThis\nflat Earth has nothing to do with the steam rocket launches,\u201d Hughes told the\nsite in 2019. \u201cIt never did, it never will. I\u2019m a daredevil!\u201d\n\nPerhaps it made sense that it was just a shtick. Hughes did death-defying\nstunts years before he joined the Flat Earthers. He was born in Oklahoma City\nin 1956 to an auto-mechanic father who enjoyed racing cars. At the age of\ntwelve, Hughes was racing on his own, and not long afterward he was riding in\nprofessional motorcycle competitions. In 1996, he got a job driving\nlimousines, but his dream of becoming the next Evel Knievel persisted; in\n2002, he drove a Lincoln Town Car off a ramp and flew a hundred and three\nfeet, landing him in Guinness World Records.\n\nWhen Hughes first successfully launched a rocket, in 2014, he had never talked\nabout the shape of the planet. In 2015, when he co-ran a Kickstarter campaign\nto fund the next rocket flight, the stated motivation was stardom, not\nscience: \u201cMad Mike Hughes always wanted to be famous so much that he just\ndecided one day to build a steam rocket and set the world record.\u201d He got two\nbackers and three hundred and ten dollars. Shortly afterward, he joined the\nFlat Earth community and tied his crusade to theirs. The community supported\nhis new fund-raising effort, attracting more than eight thousand dollars. From\nthere, his fame grew, earning him features in a documentary (\u201cRocketman,\u201d from\n2019) and that Science Channel series. Aligning with Flat Earthers clearly\npaid off.\n\nNot everyone believes that he didn\u2019t believe, however. Waldo Stakes, Hughes\u2019s\nlandlord and rocket-construction buddy, wrote on Facebook that \u201cMike was a\nreal flat earther,\u201d pointing to the \u201cdozens of books on the subject\u201d he owned,\nand said that Hughes lost money hosting a conference for the community.\nAnother of Hughes\u2019s friends told Kelly Weill that Flat Earth theory \u201cstarted\nout as a marketing approach,\u201d but that once it \u201cgenerated awareness and\ninvolvement . . . it became something to him.\u201d\n\nThe debate over Hughes\u2019s convictions centers on the premise that a belief is\neither sincere or strategic, genuine or sham. That\u2019s a false dichotomy.\nIndeed, the social functions of symbolic beliefs\u2014functions such as signalling\ngroup identity\u2014seem best achieved when the beliefs feel earnest. A Mormon who\nsays that Joseph Smith was a prophet but secretly thinks he was a normal guy\ndoesn\u2019t strike us as a real Mormon. In fact, the evolutionary theorist Robert\nTrivers argued in \u201cDeceit and Self-Deception\u201d (2011) that we trick ourselves\nin order to convince others. Our minds are maintaining two representations of\nreality: there\u2019s one that feels true and that we publicly advocate, and\nthere\u2019s another that we use to effectively interact with the world.\n\n\u201cI can say literally anything and they use it for spa music.\u201d\n\nCartoon by Sarah Morrissette\n\nLink copied\n\nThe idea of self-deception might seem like a stretch; Mercier has expressed\nskepticism about the theory. But it reconciles what appear to be contradictory\nfindings. On the one hand, some research suggests that people\u2019s beliefs in\nmisinformation are authentic. In \u201cPolitical Rumors,\u201d for example, Berinsky\ndescribes experiments he conducted suggesting that people truly believe that\nBarack Obama is a Muslim and that the U.S. government allowed the 9/11 attacks\nto happen. \u201cPeople by and large say what they mean,\u201d he concludes.\n\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s research implying that many false beliefs are\nlittle more than cheap talk. Put money on the table, and people suddenly see\nthe light. In an influential paper published in 2015, a team led by the\npolitical scientist John Bullock found sizable differences in how Democrats\nand Republicans thought about politicized topics, like the number of\ncasualties in the Iraq War. Paying respondents to be accurate, which included\nrewarding \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d responses over wrong ones, cut the differences by\neighty per cent. A series of experiments published in 2023 by van der Linden\nand three colleagues replicated the well-established finding that\nconservatives deem false headlines to be true more often than liberals\u2014but\nfound that the difference drops by half when people are compensated for\naccuracy. Some studies have reported smaller or more inconsistent effects, but\nthe central point still stands. There may be people who believe in fake news\nthe way they believe in leopards and chairs, but underlying many genuine-\nfeeling endorsements is an understanding that they\u2019re not exactly factual.\n\nVan der Linden, Berinsky, and Thagard all offer ways to fight fabrication.\nBut, because they treat misinformation as a problem of human gullibility, the\nremedies they propose tend to focus on minor issues, while scanting the larger\nsocial forces that drive the phenomenon. Consider van der Linden\u2019s\nprescription. He devotes roughly a third of \u201cFoolproof\u201d to his group\u2019s\nresearch on \u201cprebunking,\u201d or psychological inoculation. The idea is to present\npeople with bogus information before they come across it in the real world and\nthen expose its falsity\u2014a kind of epistemic vaccination. Such prebunking can\ntarget specific untruths, or it can be \u201cbroad-spectrum,\u201d as when people are\nfamiliarized with an array of misinformation techniques, from emotional\nappeals to conspiratorial language.\n\nPrebunking has received an extraordinary amount of attention. If you\u2019ve ever\nread a headline about a vaccine against fake news, it was probably about van\nder Linden\u2019s work. His team has collaborated with Google, WhatsApp, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security, and the British Prime Minister\u2019s office;\nsimilar interventions have popped up on Twitter (now X). In \u201cFoolproof,\u201d van\nder Linden reviews evidence that prebunking makes people better at identifying\nfake headlines. Yet nothing is mentioned about effects on their actual\nbehavior. Does prebunking affect medical decisions? Does it make someone more\nwilling to accept electoral outcomes? We\u2019re left wondering.\n\nThe evidential gap is all the trickier because little research exists in the\nfirst place showing that misinformation affects behavior by changing beliefs.\nBerinsky acknowledges this in \u201cPolitical Rumors\u201d when he writes that \u201cfew\nscholars have established a direct causal link\u201d between rumors and real-world\noutcomes. Does the spread of misinformation influence, say, voting decisions?\nVan der Linden admits, \u201cContrary to much of the commentary you may find in the\npopular media, scientists have been extremely skeptical.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ve been misinformed about how to fight\nmisinformation. What about the social conditions that make us susceptible? Van\nder Linden tells us that people are more often drawn to conspiracy theories\nwhen they feel \u201cuncertain and powerless,\u201d and regard themselves as\n\u201cmarginalized victims.\u201d Berinsky cites scholarship suggesting that\nconspiratorial rumors flourish among people who experience \u201ca lack of\ninterpersonal trust\u201d and \u201ca sense of alienation.\u201d In his own research, he\nfound that a big predictor of accepting false rumors is agreeing with\nstatements such as \u201cPoliticians do not care much about what they say, so long\nas they get elected.\u201d A recent study found a strong correlation between the\nprevalence of conspiracy beliefs and levels of governmental corruption; in\nthose beliefs, Americans fell midway between people from Denmark and Sweden\nand people from middle-income countries such as Mexico and Turkey, reflecting\na fraying sense of institutional integrity. More than Russian bots or click-\nhungry algorithms, a crisis of trust and legitimacy seems to lie behind the\nproliferation of paranoid falsehoods.\n\nFindings like these require that we rethink what misinformation represents. As\nDan Kahan, a legal scholar at Yale, notes, \u201cMisinformation is not something\nthat happens to the mass public but rather something that its members are\ncomplicit in producing.\u201d That\u2019s why thoughtful scholars\u2014including the\nphilosopher Daniel Williams and the experimental psychologist Sacha\nAltay\u2014encourage us to see misinformation more as a symptom than as a disease.\nUnless we address issues of polarization and institutional trust, they say,\nwe\u2019ll make little headway against an endless supply of alluring fabrications.\n\nFrom this perspective, railing against social media for manipulating our\nzombie minds is like cursing the wind for blowing down a house we\u2019ve allowed\nto go to rack and ruin. It distracts us from our collective failures, from the\nconditions that degrade confidence and leave much of the citizenry feeling\ndisempowered. By declaring that the problem consists of \u201cirresponsible senders\nand gullible receivers,\u201d in Thagard\u2019s words, credulity theorists risk ignoring\nthe social pathologies that cause people to become disenchanted and motivate\nthem to rally around strange new creeds.\n\nMike Hughes was among the disenchanted. Sure, he used Flat Earth theory to\nbecome a celebrity, but its anti-institutionalist tone also spoke to him. In\n2018, while seeking funding and attention for his next rocket ride, he self-\npublished a book titled \u201c \u2018Mad\u2019 Mike Hughes: The Tell All Tale.\u201d The book\nbrims with outlandish, unsupported assertions\u2014that George H. W. Bush was a\npedophile, say\u2014but they\u2019re interspersed with more grounded frustrations. He\nsaw a government commandeered by the greedy few, one that stretched the truth\nto start a war in Iraq, and that seemed concerned less with spreading freedom\nand more with funnelling tax dollars into the pockets of defense contractors.\n\u201cYou think about those numbers for a second,\u201d he wrote, of the amount of money\nspent on the military. \u201cWe have homelessness in this country. We could pay off\neveryone\u2019s mortgages. And we can eliminate sales tax. Everyone would actually\nbe free.\u201d\n\nHughes wasn\u2019t a chump. He just felt endlessly lied to. As he wrote near the\nend of his book, \u201cI want my coffee and I don\u2019t want any whipped cream on top\nof it, you know what I mean?
