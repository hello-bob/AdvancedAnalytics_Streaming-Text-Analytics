Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from After Effects with\nbodymovin, Sketch with Lottie Sketch Export, and from Haiku.\n\nDesigners can create and ship beautiful animations without an engineer\npainstakingly recreating them by hand. Since the animations are backed by\nJSON, they are extremely small in size but can be large in complexity!\nAnimations can be played, resized, looped, sped up, slowed down, reversed, and\neven interactively scrubbed. Lottie can play or loop just a portion of the\nanimation as well, the possibilities are endless! Animations can even be\nchanged at runtime in various ways! Change the color, position, or any\nkeyframable value!\n\nHere is just a small sampling of the power of Lottie\n\n## Installing Lottie\n\nLottie supports Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods, and Carthage (Both dynamic\nand static).\n\n### Github Repo\n\nYou can pull the Lottie Github Repo and include the Lottie.xcodeproj to build\na dynamic or static library.\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nTo install Lottie using Swift Package Manager you can follow the tutorial\npublished by Apple using the URL for the Lottie repo with the current version:\n\n  1. In Xcode, select \u201cFile\u201d \u2192 \u201cAdd Packages...\u201d\n  2. Enter https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-spm.git\n\nor you can add the following dependency to your Package.swift:\n\n    \n    \n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-spm.git\", from: \"4.4.3\")\n\nWhen using Swift Package Manager we recommend using the lottie-spm repo\ninstead of the main lottie-ios repo. The main git repository for lottie-ios is\nsomewhat large (300+ MB), and Swift Package Manager always downloads the full\nrepository with all git history. The lottie-spm repo is much smaller (less\nthan 500kb), so can be downloaded much more quickly.\n\nInstead of downloading the full git history of Lottie and building it from\nsource, the lottie-spm repo just contains a pointer to the precompiled\nXCFramework included in the latest lottie-ios release (typically ~8MB). If you\nprefer to include Lottie source directly your project, you can directly depend\non the main lottie-ios repo by referencing https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-\nios.git instead.\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nAdd the pod to your Podfile:\n\n    \n    \n    pod 'lottie-ios'\n\nAnd then run:\n\n    \n    \n    pod install\n\nAfter installing the cocoapod into your project import Lottie with\n\n    \n    \n    import Lottie\n\n### Carthage\n\nAdd Lottie to your Cartfile:\n\n    \n    \n    github \"airbnb/lottie-ios\" \"master\"\n\nAnd then run:\n\n    \n    \n    carthage update\n\nIn your application targets \u201cGeneral\u201d tab under the \u201cLinked Frameworks and\nLibraries\u201d section, drag and drop lottie-ios.framework from the\nCarthage/Build/iOS directory that carthage update produced.\n\n## Swift Version Support\n\nLottie supports Swift / Xcode versions back to the minimum version that is\npermited by Apple for submissions to the App Store. You can see the most up-\nto-date information for which Swift versions Lottie supports on Swift Package\nIndex:\n\n## Privacy\n\nLottie does not collect any data. We provide this notice to help you fill out\nApp Privacy Details. We additionally provide a privacy manifest which can be\nincluded in your app.\n\n## Security\n\nWe distribute XCFramework bundles for each release on GitHub. In Lottie 4.4.0\nand later, these XCFramework bundles include a code signature. These bundles\nare self-signed under the name \"Lottie iOS\" and have the following\nfingerprint:\n\n    \n    \n    89 2F 1B 43 04 7B 50 53 8F 2F 46 EA D9 29 00 DD 3D 48 11 F358 21 78 C0 61 A5 FB 20 F1 11 CB 26\n\nIn Xcode you can verify this by selecting Lottie.xcframework and confirming\nthat it shows the following information:\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe always appreciate contributions from the community. To make changes to the\nproject, you can clone the repo and open Lottie.xcworkspace. This workspace\nincludes:\n\n  * the Lottie framework (for iOS, macOS, and tvOS)\n  * unit tests and snapshot tests (for iOS, must be run on an iPhone 8 simulator)\n  * an Example iOS app that lets you browse and test over 100 sample animations included in the repo\n\nAll pull requests with new features or bug fixes that affect how animations\nrender should include snapshot test cases that validate the included changes.\n\n  * To add a new sample animation to the snapshot testing suite, you can add the .json file to Tests/Samples. Re-run the snapshot tests to generate the new snapshot image files.\n  * To update existing snapshots after making changes, you can set isRecording = true in SnapshotTests.swift setUp() method and then re-run the snapshot tests.\n\nThe project also includes several helpful commands defined in our Rakefile. To\nuse these, you need to install Bundler:\n\n    \n    \n    $ sudo gem install bundle $ bundle install\n\nFor example, all Swift code should be formatted according to the Airbnb Swift\nStyle Guide. After making changes, you can reformat the code automatically\nusing SwiftFormat and SwiftLint by running bundle exec rake format:swift.\nOther helpful commands include:\n\n    \n    \n    $ bundle exec rake build:all # builds all targets for all platforms $ bundle exec rake build:package:iOS # builds the Lottie package for iOS $ bundle exec rake test:package # tests the Lottie package $ bundle exec rake format:swift # reformat Swift code based on the Airbnb Swift Style Guide\n\n## About\n\nAn iOS library to natively render After Effects vector animations\n\nairbnb.io/lottie/\n\n### Topics\n\nswift ios animation transition-animation ios-animation ios-transition custom-\ntransitions keyframes bodymovin\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nApache-2.0 license\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nCode of conduct\n\n### Security policy\n\nSecurity policy\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n25.1k stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n464 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n3.7k forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases 67\n\n4.4.3 Latest\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\n\\+ 66 releases\n\n## Sponsor this project\n\n  * opencollective.com/lottie\n\n## Contributors 223\n\n\\+ 209 contributors\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Swift 98.9%\n  * Ruby 1.1%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
