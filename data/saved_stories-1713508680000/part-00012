Around 28 minutes into the documentary, Pan\u2019s high\nschool friend Nam Nguyen is described as a \u201cbubbly, happy, confident, and very\ngenuine\u201d person. His words are accompanied by a series of relevant photos.\n\nBut upon closer inspection of the images, there are signs of manipulation; one\nimage in particular showing Pan flashing peace signs with both arms appears\nblatantly manipulated offering evidence that at least some of the image was\nAI-generated.\n\nOn Pan\u2019s left hand, she appears to have only two fingers; missing a thumb, a\npinky finger, and a ring ringer. On her right hand, she is missing a pinky\nfinger and her thumb appears unnaturally long and disjointed. AI image\ngenerators notoriously have a hard time making pictures of human hands.\n\nThese are surely not Jennifer Pan\u2019s fingers.\n\nTwo other photographs showing Pan wearing the same red dress also show AI\nartifacts.\n\nA number of Pan\u2019s features seem suspect here including a long front tooth, a\nstrange gap in her right cheek, and a misshapen ear.Another of the images that\nappear in the documentary. This one has fewer suspect image artifacts.\n\n## Did Netflix Use AI-Manipulated Photos in What Jennifer Did?\n\nIt is difficult to know exactly what has gone on in the editing process but it\ncould be that the producers had one image and used it as a source picture to\nmake more \u201cphotos\u201d.\n\nAny type of manipulation of photos of a true crime documentary is\ncontroversial because a story \u2014 especially one as sensitive as Pan\u2019s \u2014 should\nbe told truthfully and unvarnished even when that story is being told through\nimagery.\n\n\u201cResorting to the tech to generate pictures of a real person, especially of\nsomebody who\u2019s still in jail and will only be eligible for parole around 2040,\nshould raise some alarm bells,\u201d writes Futurism.\n\nWhat Jennifer Did was released on Netflix on April 10.
