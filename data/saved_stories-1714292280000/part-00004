Photograph by\nMarilyn O\u2019Connor.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do with the old magazines when the new issues come out?\u201d I asked\nthe librarian.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the year, we donate them to neighborhood schools so kids can\ncut them up and make collages,\u201d she replied.\n\nOur small public library is relatively new, sparsely filled with only the most\npopular items: a smattering of pregnancy and parenting books, mostly on sleep\ntraining; the latest mystery novels; DVDs on how to build your own she-shed;\nand a few shelves of history and religion to round it out. We live in a\nmaster-planned community filled with parks in a kid-friendly city, so the\nchildren\u2019s section is by far the biggest part of the library.\n\nThis library is very different from the Rochester Public Library close to\nwhere I grew up in New York. I can remember our mom bringing my older brother,\nPhil, and me to the main branch downtown during school breaks to pass the\ntime. The children\u2019s room was so tucked away you had to crawl through a tiny\nchild-size secret wooden door to get to it. That was my favorite part. The\nlibrary, which opened in 1936, was massive, dark, and quiet, but inside that\nsmall room, there were tall windows where the sun splashed from the Genesee\nRiver onto the colorfully illustrated book covers. I wanted to check out\ndozens of books but knew that my mom would get frustrated trying to find the\noverdue items missing somewhere in our messy room while late fees piled up.\n\nPhil and I loved reading. We shared a bedroom until our sister went off to\ncollege. We had bunk beds; he slept on the bottom. This way, we could each\nstay up reading with our own flashlight and not disturb the other\u2014though, of\ncourse, we found plenty of other reasons to complain about this setup.\n\nPhil loved the Encyclopedia Brown books, and he read a lot of Hardy Boys. He\nreally enjoyed a good mystery, especially if it was funny. He had a lot of\nfavorite movies, but I would say one of his absolute favorites, even as an\nadult, was The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 Smarter Brother (1975), with Gene\nWilder, Marty Feldman, and Madeline Kahn. In one scene, Gene Wilder, playing\nSherlock Holmes\u2019s younger brother, Sigerson, is about to meet the foreign\nsecretary, Lord Redcliff. Sigerson walks into the room alone. Checks his fly\nto be sure it\u2019s closed. Spies a box of chocolates. Puts one in his mouth. He\nis startled, and spills the box clumsily to the floor. Just as Lord Redcliff\nwalks in, Sigerson decides the best course of action is to hide all the\nchocolates in his mouth. With his mouth full and chocolate smeared all over\nhis hands and face, he attempts to hide the empty candy box behind his back.\nLord Redcliff spends the rest of the scene shuffling back and forth, peeking\naround to try and see what Sigerson is hiding.\n\nEmily and Phil at seven and nine years old, 1976.

The physical comedy is subtle\nin that the main character is unaware of his buffoonery\u2014only the audience is\nin on the joke. Phil did this a lot: we would know that something was up, but\nthe character himself was often clueless. This was true both of Phil\u2019s comedic\nscenes and more dramatic ones: Sandy Lyle sharting at the party in Along Came\nPolly, Scotty J. trying to kiss Mark Wahlberg\u2019s character in Boogie Nights,\nand the CIA agent Gust Avrakotos smashing the window in Charlie Wilson\u2019s War.\nAll three characters possess the same loud, obnoxious physicality. And then\nyou see it in more nuanced ways, like when the brother in The Savages sneaks a\ncookie before the support group meeting is over, or when Freddie Miles jabs at\nthe piano key in The Talented Mr. Ripley, or when Truman Capote takes tiny\nbites from the baby-food jars in Capote. These gestures brought his characters\nto life, and made us empathize and identify with their excitement,\nembarrassment, anger, and heartache.\n\nEven now, when I watch Phil playing these parts in films that now capture a\ndistant past, in roles that have become familiar to us, I can see so much of\nwho he was. He was a cuddly person, much more so than me. He loved to sit\nclose on a couch, walk arm in arm down the street, and hug big. We grew up\nlike two hamsters making nests out of blankets and books. We burrowed\ntogether, especially when things felt scary or loud. We made up stories that\ntook us away from the chaos of our house and into building forts in the woods,\nrowing boats together on Keuka Lake, or walking to The Brick Oven to eat pizza\nby ourselves like we were grown-ups.\n\nAnd then there were the loud parts. My brother had a lot of loud parts, like\nhis laughter and big gestures of annoyance. The way he would jump up and dance\naround when teasing you\u2014even after you\u2019d pleaded for him to stop, he just\ncouldn\u2019t help poking fun one last time. He knew it was wrong, but he was going\nto do it anyway, and laugh until you were laughing too. And then do it again,\nuntil you weren\u2019t laughing, because we Hoffmans are not good at knowing how to\nstop. We know when to stop, we can tell the mood has shifted, but we always\ntake things one step too far.\n\nShortly after Phil died, I scoured the library shelves for every periodical\nthat even mentioned him. Early in my twenties, I\u2019d begun saving every magazine\nor newspaper article Phil was ever featured in\u2014at least the ones I knew about.\nI even had all his interviews on VHS. And here were the final magazine stories\ndetailing his life cut short. At first, I just wanted to be sure I collected\nall the glowing obituaries reviewing the life and unexpected death of this\ntalented young actor who mesmerized us with his art. But then I became\nobsessive. Even the weekly TV Guide put his name in the crossword: 15 down,\ntwenty letters, \u201cOscar overdose.\u201d I added it to my pile.\n\n\u201cSo, these magazines will just get cut up by little kids?\u201d I asked the\nlibrarian.\n\n\u201cYes. Or recycled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if someone wanted to keep them when the library was done with them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s just too hard to keep track of requests like this.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want to read these articles. But I didn\u2019t want children cutting them\nup in class next year. More importantly, I didn\u2019t want one of my children to\nbe sitting in art class and get handed one of these magazines and open it up\nto see their uncle Phil.\n\nSo I scooped them all up, handed her my library card, and checked them out. I\ntook them home and went up to my room. I hid in the small space between my bed\nand the dresser with a pair of scissors I\u2019d stolen from my daughter\u2019s\nbackpack. I sat on the floor and cut all the articles and photos of Phil out\nof each magazine. I tried to make the missing pages look inconspicuous. But\nthere was no way to really hide it, especially when he was on the cover.\n\nMagazine clippings were everywhere. Our lives had been cut into tiny pieces\nand gobbled up, and we spent a lot of time trying to hide it all away,\nincluding from each other. Eventually, I tucked all the clippings into an old\ncigar box, which I carefully placed up high on a shelf in my closet. I\nreturned the cut-up magazines to the library, slipping them into the book\ndeposit slot and hoping the cameras wouldn\u2019t catch me. I imagined the\nlibrarian deciding to read The New Yorker on her lunch break and realizing\nthat someone had ripped out this key, important article from the magazine. I\nwalked home in the snow, thinking about the mystery I\u2019d created for her with\nthe missing pieces and also how Phil would think I was ridiculous for doing\nall this. He\u2019d wrap his big arm around me, and we would walk a little quicker\nas the temperature dropped and the sun set lower in the sky. We would talk,\nlike when we were kids, imagining the story of Encyclopedia Brown trying to\nsolve The Case of the Vanishing Actor, which takes place in a library with a\nsmall wooden door.\n\nEm and Phil in New York City, fall of 1987.\n\nEmily Anne Barr is a pediatric nurse practitioner, a midwife, and a nurse\nscientist caring for families impacted by HIV.
