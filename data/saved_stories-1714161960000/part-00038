Parental control on Android works\nmuch better and there is no one more minute option. By the way, it is not one\nminute. It is one minute per application and if they uninstall and reinstall\nit they get another minute. So there isn't really a time limit. Apple knows\nthis and promotes it so all kids will prefere an iPhone so they don't have use\nlimits.
