The Physical Aspects of the Living Cell\ninspired biologists and challenged the expectations of physicists on the\nunderlying working principles of living systems. It was published in 1944 and\nexplored whether the statistical approach of physics can account for cellular\nprocesses in living organisms. On the occasion of its 80th anniversary, we\nreflect on its efforts to link biology and physics and on how scientists study\nthese phenomena today.\n\nCredit: arkela / Alamy Stock Vector\n\nPhysical laws rely on order, or \u201corder from disorder\u201d, as Schr\u00f6dinger put\nit^1. Although Isaac Newton\u2019s description of the planets had become a\nparadigmatic case of determinism by the time Schr\u00f6dinger delivered his\nlectures, advances in statistical physics and quantum mechanics had shown that\nat the microscopic level lay disorder and indeterminism. Take atoms in a gas,\nfor example. They move randomly, producing varying degrees of thermal\ndisorder; but when averaged over large numbers, their macroscopic properties\ncan be described by exact physical laws. One typical example is diffusion:\nalthough it can be modelled as a structured process, it stems from random\nBrownian trajectories of individual components.\n\nBut living and inanimate matter differ in their statistical behaviour. Whereas\nphysicists would expect \u201ca big number of atoms controlling the whole\nsystem\u201d^1, an organism\u2019s biology is controlled by a relatively small number of\natoms making up its genetic material. In this way, genes generate \u201corder from\norder\u201d by passing hereditary information down a lineage. This concept,\ntogether with X-ray crystallography experiments by Rosalind Franklin, inspired\nJames Watson and Francis Crick and led to the discovery of DNA structure and\nits central role in living cells.\n\nToday, scientists know there is more to order and disorder than meets the eye.\nFor example, cell signalling is coordinated by intrinsically disordered\nproteins (or regions within proteins). This so-called disorder\u2013function\nparadigm^2 changed the traditional view on structure\u2013function relationships\nand proved that proteins can carry out cellular functions without three-\ndimensionally stable folded structures.\n\nBut how is an organism able to maintain any form of collective order given the\nthermal disorder at its core? In his essays, Schr\u00f6dinger evoked clockwork as a\nmetaphor. In the same way heat disorder is unable to disturb the solid\nconstituents of clockwork enough to alter its movement, an organism\u2019s workings\nrely on an \u201caperiodic crystal\u201d (now known as DNA) which is held together by\nforces that are strong enough to resist thermally driven structural\nvariations. Beyond this illustrative explanation, it all comes down to\nentropy.\n\nLiving systems operate in non-equilibrium conditions to reduce their entropy.\nThis is an organism\u2019s secret to avoid the second law of thermodynamics and a\nrelentless descent into a more disordered form. In the pursuit of homeostasis\n\u2014 the dynamic, self-regulating state characteristic of life by which organisms\nmaintain stability against changing conditions \u2014 biological systems depart\nfrom the physicist\u2019s probabilistic framework, which describes inanimate\nmatter, leading to an inherently informational and more deterministic picture.\n\nThis mechanism is at play during cellular processes that are paramount to\nlife, such as cell metabolism and the transport of solutes across the cell\nmembrane^3. Entropy reduction also occurs via the formation of biomolecular\ncondensates and information storage in DNA^3. Biomolecular condensates are\nmembraneless structures present in eukaryotic cells \u2014 cells that contain a\nnucleus \u2014 which perform a range of functions from controlling the rate of\nchemical reactions to enabling homeostatic cellular responses. Their formation\nis driven by extracellular stimuli, placing them at the centre of information\nexchange between a cell and its environment^4.\n\nToday\u2019s equivalent of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s clockwork-inspired view on biological\norder may be found in mechanobiology. This field is concerned with the\nmechanical rather than the thermodynamic aspects of the interaction between\nliving cells and their environment. The processes by which cells sense\nexternal mechanical signals and translate them into a response \u2014\nmechanosensing and mechanotransduction \u2014 govern crucial cellular behaviour,\nsuch as motility and tissue morphogenesis^5.\n\nFrom understanding the role of DNA as information carrier and of structure-\ndependent protein functionalities, to non-equilibrium thermodynamics,\nbiomolecular condensates and mechanobiology, the connection between physics\nand biology proposed by Schr\u00f6dinger continues to go from strength to strength.\nThe idea of bringing two seemingly opposite disciplines together was a crucial\nstep to advancing our understanding of life. It has already generated a number\nof interesting fields that promise to thrive for years to come.\n\n## References\n\n  1. Schr\u00f6dinger, E. What is Life?
