The\ncomplaints argue that Tesla exaggerated the capabilities of the feature, which\ncontrols steering, speed and other actions typically left to the driver. As a\nresult, the lawsuits claim, the company created a false sense of complacency\nthat led the drivers to tragedy.\n\nEvidence emerging in the cases \u2014 including dash-cam video obtained by The\nWashington Post \u2014 offers sometimes-shocking details: In Phoenix, a woman\nallegedly relying on Autopilot plows into a disabled car and is then struck\nand killed by another vehicle after exiting her Tesla. In Tennessee, an\nintoxicated man allegedly using Autopilot drives down the wrong side of the\nroad for several minutes before barreling into an oncoming car, killing the\n20-year-old inside.\n\nTesla maintains that it is not liable for the crashes because the driver is\nultimately in control of the vehicle. But that contention is coming under\nincreasing pressure, including from federal regulators. Late Thursday, the\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a new review of\nAutopilot, signaling concern that a December recall failed to significantly\nimprove misuse of the technology and that drivers are misled into thinking the\n\u201cautomation has greater capabilities than it does.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a surprising twist, Tesla this month settled a high-profile case\nin Northern California that claimed Autopilot played a role in the fatal crash\nof an Apple engineer, Walter Huang. The company\u2019s decision to settle with\nHuang\u2019s family \u2014 along with a ruling from a Florida judge concluding that\nTesla had \u201cknowledge\u201d that its technology was \u201cflawed\u201d under certain\nconditions \u2014 is giving fresh momentum to cases once seen as long shots, legal\nexperts said.\n\n\u201cA reckoning is coming as more and more of these cases are going to see the\nlight of a jury trial,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, a lawyer with Singleton\nSchreiber who is representing the family of Jovani Maldonado, 15, who was\nkilled in Northern California when a Tesla in Autopilot rear-ended his\nfamily\u2019s pickup truck in 2019.\n\nTesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the lawsuits.\n\nDash-cam footage from August 2019 shows a Tesla rear-end another car.

Tesla\u2019s stock has\nlost more than a third of its value since the beginning of the year. Last\nweek, the company reported a steeper-than-expected 55 percent plunge in first-\nquarter profit as it struggles with falling sales of electric vehicles and\nstiff competition from China. To allay investors\u2019 concerns, Musk has made\nlofty promises about launching a fully autonomous \u201crobotaxi\u201d in August. Soon,\nhe said during Tuesday\u2019s earnings call, driving a car will be like riding an\nelevator: you get on and get out at your destination.\n\n\u201cWe should be thought of as an AI or robotics company,\u201d Musk told investors.\n\u201cIf somebody doesn\u2019t believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they\nshould not be an investor in the company. But we will.\u201d\n\nFollow Technology\n\nMeanwhile, the company has defended itself in court documents by arguing that\nits user manuals and on-screen warnings make \u201cextremely clear\u201d that drivers\nmust be fully in control while using Autopilot. Many of the upcoming court\ncases involve driver distraction or impairment.\n\nAutopilot \u201cis not a self-driving technology and does not replace the driver,\u201d\nTesla said in response to a 2020 case filed in Florida. \u201cThe driver can and\nmust still brake, accelerate and steer just as if the system is not engaged.\u201d\n\nBut the Huang case also potentially involved a distracted driver: Huang was\nallegedly playing a video game when his Tesla plowed into a highway barrier in\n2018. Tesla has not said why it decided to settle the lawsuit, and details of\nthe settlement have not been disclosed in court documents.\n\n###\n\nMore fatal crash details emerge\n\nMeanwhile, federal regulators appear increasingly sympathetic to claims that\nTesla oversells its technology and misleads drivers. Even the decision to call\nthe software Autopilot \u201celicits the idea of drivers not being in control\u201d and\ninvites \u201cdrivers to overly trust the automation,\u201d NHTSA said Thursday,\nrevealing that a two-year investigation into Autopilot had identified 467\ncrashes linked to the technology, 13 of them fatal.\n\nNHTSA did not offer specific information about those crashes. But two fatal\ncrashes from 2022 are detailed in lawsuits that have not been previously\nreported.\n\nIn Phoenix, Iwanda Mitchell, 49, was driving a Tesla in May 2022 when she\nstruck a Toyota Camry that had stalled on the highway, according to court\ndocuments and dash-cam footage obtained by The Post. According the Mitchell\u2019s\nfamily\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan Michaels with MLG Attorneys at Law, Autopilot and\nthe car\u2019s other features \u2014 including forward collision warning and automatic\nemergency braking \u2014 failed to result in Mitchell\u2019s Tesla taking evasive action\nand prevent the vehicle from barreling into the stalled sedan.\n\nMitchell was then struck and killed by an oncoming vehicle when she got out of\nher car.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment regarding this case. In\nresponse to the complaint in January 2024, Tesla said it denies the allegation\nand \u201chas not yet had an opportunity to inspect\u201d Mitchell\u2019s vehicle.\n\nIwanda Delci Mitchell's Tesla failed to see a broken down sedan in the middle\nof the highway in Phoenix. (Video: Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nAbout a month later in Sumner County, Tenn., Jose Roman Jaramillo Cortez drank\ntwo beers and three tequila shots after his shift at a local restaurant, and\nthen hopped into his Tesla Model 3, court documents say. He plugged his\naddress into the Tesla\u2019s GPS and flicked on Autopilot, it said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit filed in June 2023 and dash-cam footage obtained by\nThe Post, the car then pulled onto the wrong side of the road. After driving\nsouth in a northbound lane for several minutes, the Tesla rammed into a car\ndriven by Christian Malone, 20, who died from the impact. In its response to\nthe complaint, Tesla said \u201cthe crash was caused by the negligence and/or\nrecklessness of the driver.\u201d\n\nTrial dates for both cases will be set later next year, Michaels said.\n\nIn another case \u2014 set for trial in November in Key Largo, Fla. \u2014 a Tesla in\nAutopilot allegedly failed to detect an approaching T-intersection while its\ndriver searched for a dropped phone. The Tesla barreled through flashing\nlights and a physical barricade before crashing into a vehicle parked on the\nside of the road, killing a woman and seriously injuring a man.\n\nIn court documents, Tesla has argued that the driver was ultimately\nresponsible for the trajectory of the car. Tesla also states in user manuals\nthat Autopilot may not operate as intended \u201cwhen unable to accurately\ndetermine lane markings\u201d or when \u201cbright light is interfering with the\ncamera\u2019s view.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhen these cases head to trial, juries may be asked to consider whether\nTesla\u2019s many driver warnings are sufficient to spare the company from\nliability. Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment\nManagement, said the last thing the company needs is a highly publicized\ncourtroom battle that focuses attention on such questions.\n\nAt a trial, \u201cthe defense would dig into the weeds ... and it would become very\nclear that the perception of the Autopilot software was very different from\nthe reality,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cEvery day would be a headline, and it would be\nembarrassing.\u201d\n\nSo far, Tesla has faced a jury only once over the role Autopilot may have\nplayed in a fatal crash. In Riverside, Calif., last year, a jury heard the\ncase of Micah Lee, 37, who was allegedly using Autopilot when his Tesla Model\n3 suddenly veered off the highway at 65 mph, crashed into a palm tree and\nburst into flames. Lee died from his injuries, while his fianc\u00e9e and her son\nwere severely injured.\n\nDue to the extensive damage to the car, Tesla said it could not be proved that\nAutopilot was engaged at the time of the crash. During the trial, Michael\nCarey, the attorney for Tesla, argued the technology was not at fault, and\nthat the crash \u201cis classic human error.\u201d According to a toxicology report\ntaken after the crash, Lee had alcohol in his system but it was within the\nlegal limit in California.\n\n\u201cThis case is not about Autopilot. Autopilot didn\u2019t cause the crash,\u201d Carey\nsaid during opening statements. \u201cThis is a bad crash with bad injuries and may\nhave resulted from bad mistakes \u2014 but you can\u2019t blame the car company when\nthat happens. This is a good car with a good design.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Tesla\u2019s arguments prevailed, and a jury found the company not\nliable.\n\nBut the company appears to face headwinds in some other cases. Last year,\nFlorida Circuit Judge Reid Scott upheld a plaintiff\u2019s request to seek punitive\ndamages in a case concerning a fatal crash in Delray Beach, Fla., in 2019 when\nJeremy Banner and his Tesla in Autopilot failed to register a semi truck\ncrossing its path. The car plowed under the truck at full speed, killing\nBanner on impact.\n\nVideo obtained exclusively by The Washington Post shows the moment a Tesla\noperating on Autopilot crashed into a truck parked on a rural Florida road in\n2019. (Video: Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nIn the ruling, Scott said the family\u2019s lawyers \u201csufficiently\u201d presented\nevidence to reasonably seek punitive damages at trial, which could run\nmillions of dollars.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 evidence included that Tesla \u201cknew the vehicle at issue had a\ndefective Autopilot system,\u201d according to order. Citing other fatal crashes\ninvolving Autopilot, Scott wrote that there is a \u201cgenuine\u201d dispute over\nwhether Tesla \u201ccreated a foreseeable zone of risk that posed a general threat\nof harm to others.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s appeal of the ruling is pending.\n\n###\n\nChange in defense strategy?\n\nAs the spate of lawsuits churns forward, Tesla has shown a fresh willingness\nto settle such cases \u2014 despite Musk\u2019s vow on Twitter in 2022 to never settle\n\u201can unjust case against us even if we will probably lose.\u201d\n\nIn addition to settling the Huang case, Tesla \u201cindicated\u201d that it was open to\ndiscussing a potential settlement in the Riverside case as it was being\npresented to a jury last fall, said Michaels, the MLG lawyer who represented\nLee\u2019s family.\n\nThe month-long trial featured testimony from an accident reconstructionist, a\ntop engineer at Tesla and a paramedic who responded to the crash and said it\nwas among the most horrific accidents he had ever seen. Michaels said he\ndeclined to engage in settlement talks because he wanted to continue to \u201cmake\nthis a really public issue.\u201d He said he also \u201cdid not have confidence in our\nability to come to an agreeable amount.\u201d\n\nTesla and its lawyer in the case, Carey, did not respond to a request for\ncomment.\n\nAfter four days of deliberations, the jury decided the case in Tesla\u2019s favor.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThough he lost, Michaels said the trial attracted media attention and gave\nother lawyers with cases against Tesla insight into the company\u2019s defense\nstrategy. Plus, he said, his law firm\u2019s phone has since been blowing up with\npotential clients.\n\n\u201cWe walked away from guaranteed money,\u201d Michaels said, \u201cbut that wasn\u2019t what\nit was about.\u201d\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": true}
