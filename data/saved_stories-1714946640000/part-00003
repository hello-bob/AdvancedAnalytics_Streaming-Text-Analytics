I\nreally, really badly wish to play this\n\nReply\n\nVladimir Slepnev87 days ago\n\nSorry man, this was so long ago. I think Android and the Play Store have\nchanged enough that making the game work again would take me awhile. Maybe\njust play online instead.\n\nReply\n\nColorfulShapes86 days ago\n\nI don't play things online because one day they'll disappear and i dont want\nto need to cope with losing things just because they're only available online\n\ud83e\udee0\n\nReply\n\nDamian280935 days ago\n\nYou can download the archive and open the index.html then you can run it with\nsome apps\n\nReply\n\nElioneli192 days ago\n\nabsolutely loving this game\n\nReply\n\nMalikune343 days ago (1 edit) (+1)\n\n6 Minutes and 28 Seconds.

One time I\nwas walking across a bridge, laptop in hand, playing the game. All of a sudden\nsome IDIOT bumped into me and I dropped my laptop over the bridge. I was\nfurious but could think of nothing else but to jump after it. I needed to beat\nmy highscore. While in mid air i mistakenly hit left instead of right, ending\nmy run. i was devastated and heartbroken. Seconds later upon impact I broke\nall of the limbs in my body and suffered severe brain damage. Now I cant play\nanymore and my life has no meaning. Overall decent game 7/10\n\nReply\n\nrayadomian1 year ago\n\nWishing you a speedy recovery!!!!

This has\ndestroyed friendships, relationships, and my GPA. I warn anyone embarking on\nthis glorious yet foul journey. Ask yourself: What is glory?\n\nReply\n\nrayadomian1 year ago\n\nThanks for this insight elly!\n\nReply\n\nVladsDad1 year ago(+1)\n\nBro same. After 6 months of playing at least 8 hours a day I have finally beat\nmy 30 second record. It has cost me a lot too, but days like today make it all\nworth it. Godspeed all #roadtooneminute\n\nReply\n\nduncannofsinger1 year ago(+1)\n\nMy mother always told me: whatever you are, be a good one. I've meandered\nthrough mindless jobs, pointless hobbies, and expensive schooling only to find\nthat no endeavor suits my inescapable black sheep nature. Until I discovered\nyour creation, Vladimir. Nothing inspires me to improve and become my best\nself quite like the pure survival of zigs and zags. Sooner or later, this\ngodsend will take me into an even darker place on the outside world. But until\nthen, I'll be here. #bettertoburnoutthanfadeaway\n\nReply\n\nEndless Pixel1 year ago(+1)\n\nVery great game !\n\nQuazar is now professionally known as Axwell, a Swedish house musician (that's\n11 years ago).\n\nReply\n\nghost2 years ago(+4)\n\nwhat am i supposed to do\n\nReply\n\nOlesch2 years ago (1 edit) (+1)\n\nHad a battle with my brother. Beating the other one's record.\n\nWe started with ~30-40s were our first runs. 1min seemed impossible at that\nmoment. I was very proud, when I managed 1:10. Then he managed 1:12 or\nsomething. Then I got to 1:13 and suddenly 1:20. I felt safe.\n\nThen suddenly he comes up with statistics in an excel, which types of curves\nkill him the most and an astonishing 1:30. 1:30 felt too far, like I could\nnever reach that. But after 5-10h of playtime stretched over one week I\nfinally managed 1:31.\n\nWhat really helped: Don't focus your eyes, keep them unfocussed, more or less\nin the center. Don't rush it, keep the white line near the middle, no need to\nkeep it at the border of your screen.\n\nThis game is very addicting and has a really, really high production value!\n\nReply\n\ndumb rhythm gamer1 year ago\n\nimagine\n\nimagine\n\nReply\n\ngalaxyyyyy2 years ago\n\nshape rotators rise up\n\nReply\n\nHugeFanofSpongeBob2 years ago\n\nVladimirslepnev Zig Zag game not available on Google play store can i have apk\nfile of it\n\nReply\n\nAbrakadabra4542 years ago\n\nits just stuck loading on the menu :|\n\nReply\n\nincrepare2 years ago\n\ncute :)\n\nReply\n\nitch.io Sufferer3 years ago\n\nThis game is awesome! Closest we get to super hexagon in terms of inspired.\n\nReply\n\nBig Brain Time4 years ago(+3)(-4)\n\nhow am i supposed to know which way to go? im going the way the path goes but\nit says its wrong.\n\nReply\n\nRando-Malo (RegisRquoi)7 years ago(+2)\n\nReally cool.\n\nControls were a bit confusing for me. I think there's two reasons for it:\n\n1\\. the sign \"press left, up, right\" is not visible enough (and there's\nnothing in the itch description too)\n\n2.At first, I thought the game was meant to be played with the mouse, because:\nwhen I clicked, the game started, and wen I clicked again, it counted as \"go\nleft\" and the game kept going. So I was like. \"okay I'm supposed to click on\nthe left or right side of the line and it didn't work. I had to look on the\ncomment where you explained to get it :')\n\nThe game is looking cool, and it's pretty fun. Good work on this ! :) Super\nchallenging too, haha ! I like that.\n\nReply\n\narrogant.gamer7 years ago\n\nAny plans for a global leaderboard?\n\nReply\n\nVladimir Slepnev7 years ago(+1)\n\nI'm thinking about it. Not sure what to do about cheaters though, because\ncheating in a JS game is very easy.\n\nReply\n\nSvenR2 years ago (1 edit)\n\nYup, this got me up to 6:13. Reducing the interval would improve it:\n\nsetInterval(() => { if (interpIndex < 10) handleMove(path[pathIndex + 1] -\npath[pathIndex]); }, 100);\n\nReply\n\ngroverburger7 years ago\n\nWow this is really fun. On par with super hexagon. A few more song choices\nwould be nice however.\n\nReply\n\nVladimir Slepnev7 years ago\n\nThanks! I'm always looking for other songs to add. Funky Stars sets a pretty\nhigh bar though :-)\n\nReply\n\nnikotwenty7 years ago(+2)\n\nMaybe if I understood how to actually play\n\nReply\n\nVladimir Slepnev7 years ago(+3)\n\nPress left or right to choose which way the line should go next, from the\nperspective of the line. For example, when the line is pointing up, left goes\nleft and right goes right. When the line is pointing down, right goes left and\nleft goes right.\n\nReply\n\narrogant.gamer7 years ago (5 edits)\n\nThis is my new jam\n\nHigh Score: 67 sec\n\nReply\n\nDeleted post7 years ago\n\nDeleted 7 years ago\n\nReply\n\nDeleted post7 years ago\n\nDeleted 7 years ago\n\nReply\n\nDeleted post7 years ago\n\nDeleted 7 years ago\n\nReply\n\nVladimir Slepnev7 years ago\n\nCome on man, you can do better than that.
