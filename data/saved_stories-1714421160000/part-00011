It said homes contained an average of nine connected\ndevices.\n\nAs well as basic broadband routers, that can include toys that are linked to\nthe web, or home appliances such as radiators, ovens and fridges that can be\ncontrolled remotely.\n\nHowever, since their adoption there has also been a proliferation of reports\nof hackers taking over such devices to misuse them, sometimes filming or\nrecording covertly, spying on people, or stealing personal data.\n\n  * Police welcome video doorbells, but do they cut crime?\n  * 'Mass surveillance' fears over law change plans\n  * Aga app 'could let hackers turn off oven'\n\nSarah Lyons, from the National Cyber Security Centre, said firms making the\nproducts needed to take responsibility.\n\n\"Businesses have a major role to play in protecting the public by ensuring the\nsmart products they manufacture, import or distribute provide ongoing\nprotection against cyber-attacks and this landmark Act will help consumers to\nmake informed decisions about the security of products they buy,\" she said.\n\nKen Munro a security researcher for Pen Test Partners, a firm that carries out\nethical hacking against smart devices, described the new law as \"a step in the\nright direction\".\n\n\"It's got teeth, which I love,\" he said.\n\nPreviously it has been too easy for manufacturers to end support for older\nproducts as they rolled out new models, he said, and it would be useful for\nconsumers to be able to compare how many years of support were promised for\nthe product they are purchasing.\n\nA longer support period suggested a manufacturer that was generally taking\ncyber-security seriously, he said.\n\n\"I think some device manufacturers at the bottom of the market might pay lip-\nservice and do the bare minimum to make their products secure,\" he said.\n\nRocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer group Which? said\nthe new law would give consumers \"vital protections\".\n\nBut the Office for Product Safety and Standards should be prepared to \"take\nstrong enforcement action against manufacturers if they flout the law\" he\nadded.\n\n## German parents told to destroy 'spy' dolls\n\n## Divisive Online Safety rules become law in UK\n\n## Musk in China to discuss enabling Full Self Driving\n\n## Aga app 'could let hackers turn off oven'\n\nCyber-security\n\nRelated\n\n## Honeytrap mystery is even stranger than we thought\n\n13 Apr 2024\n\nUK Politics\n\n## Cyber-attack data 'could be sold by hackers'\n\n12 Apr 2024\n\nLeicester\n\n## Ukraine gives award to vigilantes for Russia hacks\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\nTechnology\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
