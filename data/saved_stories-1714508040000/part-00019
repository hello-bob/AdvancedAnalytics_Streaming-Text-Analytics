Kivim\u00e4ki\nstill denies any wrongdoing, Jaari added.\n\n## Previous conviction not taken into account\n\nAlthough Kivim\u00e4ki has a prior conviction for fraud, he had not served any\nprison time in the five years preceding the hacking of Vastaamo's database and\nwas therefore considered to be a first-time offender under Finnish law.\n\nHe was previously found guilty of fraud against American Airlines and the US\nauthorities, after he made false distress calls that led US police departments\nto send special forces to people's homes and the airline to abort a flight.\n\nKivim\u00e4ki made the calls in 2014, when he was 16-17 years old. The Helsinki\nCourt of Appeal handed him a 10-month suspended prison sentence in 2022 along\nwith a fine.\n\nHelsinki District Court handed Vastaamo's former CEO Ville Tapio a three-month\nsuspended prison sentence in April last year on a data protection charge\nbecause he did not fulfil General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nrequirements. This verdict was appealed by both Tapio and the prosecutor, and\nthe appeal hearing will begin in May 2025.\n\n## More on the subject: The package contains 4 links\n\n## More on the subject\n\nCrime\n\n### Fingerprint photo led investigators to therapy centre hacking suspect\n\n2023\n\nCrime\n\n### Vastaamo suspect Kivim\u00e4ki ordered back behind bars \u2013 but whereabouts\nunknown\n\n19.2.\n\nCrime\n\n### Therapy centre hack suspect faces aggravated extortion, other charges\n\n2023\n\nCrime\n\n### Court orders Vastaamo suspect's continued detention\n\n2023\n\n## Latest: paketissa on 10 artikkelia\n\n## Latest\n\nNewsCelebrations\n\n### May Day Eve festivities take a fresh turn in Helsinki, honour tradition\nelsewhere\n\nThe Havis Amanda statue, the traditional focal point of celebrations, is\nundergoing restoration, so students are instead gathering around a makeshift\nmonument.\n\n16:47Discuss\n\nNewsPolitics\n\n### S\u00e1mi Parliament board sign UN complaint over election re-run\n\nThe Supreme Administrative Court has ruled that last year's elections to the\nS\u00e1mi Parliament must be run again with 65 voters reinstated to the electoral\nroll.\n\n15:36Discuss\n\nNewsCrime\n\n### Court hands Kivim\u00e4ki 6-year prison sentence in historic hacking case\n\nAleksanteri Kivim\u00e4ki's hacking of psychotherapy centre Vastaamo's patient\ndatabase led to a case with the largest number of victims in Finnish legal\nhistory.\n\n14:21\n\nNewsCrime\n\n### Finns Party committee proposes ejecting gun-toting MP from parliamentary\ngroup\n\n13:56\n\nNewsAgriculture\n\n### Farms behind schedule after cold spring\n\n13:321 comment\n\nNewsCrime\n\n### Police establish unit to tackle online scams\n\n11:25Discuss\n\nNewsPolitics\n\n### Poll: Li Andersson most competent party leader\n\n9:543 comments\n\nNewsMedia\n\n### Tuesday's papers: Vornanen fallout, banking risks and Tappara shares\n\n9:12\n\nNewsTravel\n\n### Finnair suspends flights to Estonian city following GPS disruptions\n\n29.4.1 comment\n\nNewsPolitics\n\n### Finns Party MP faces police probe, loses leader Purra's trust over karaoke\nbar shooting incident\n\n29.4.\n\n## Most read\n\n  1. 1\n\nDomestic news\n\n### Finland set for warmest May Day of the decade\n\n  2. 2\n\nMedia\n\n### Tuesday's papers: Vornanen fallout, banking risks and Tappara shares\n\n  3. 3\n\nPolitics\n\n### Poll: Li Andersson most competent party leader\n\n  4. 4\n\nCrime\n\n### Police establish unit to tackle online scams\n\n  5. 5\n\nCrime\n\n### Court hands Kivim\u00e4ki 6-year prison sentence in historic hacking case\n\n## Latest\n\n  1. 16:47\n\nCelebrations\n\n### May Day Eve festivities take a fresh turn in Helsinki, honour tradition\nelsewhere\n\n  2. 15:36\n\nPolitics\n\n### S\u00e1mi Parliament board sign UN complaint over election re-run\n\n  3. 14:21\n\nCrime\n\n### Court hands Kivim\u00e4ki 6-year prison sentence in historic hacking case\n\n  4. 13:56\n\nCrime\n\n### Finns Party committee proposes ejecting gun-toting MP from parliamentary\ngroup\n\n  5. 13:32\n\nAgriculture\n\n### Farms behind schedule after cold spring\n\n  6. 11:25\n\nCrime\n\n### Police establish unit to tackle online scams\n\n  7. 9:54\n\nPolitics\n\n### Poll: Li Andersson most competent party leader\n\n  8. 9:12\n\nMedia\n\n### Tuesday's papers: Vornanen fallout, banking risks and Tappara shares\n\n  9. 29.4.\n\nTravel\n\n### Finnair suspends flights to Estonian city following GPS disruptions\n\n  10. 29.4.\n\nPolitics\n\n### Finns Party MP faces police probe, loses leader Purra's trust over karaoke\nbar shooting incident\n\n  11. 29.4.\n\nForeign policy\n\n### Paper: EU guards to remain at Finnish-Russian border until at least autumn\n\n  12. 29.4.\n\nDomestic news\n\n### Finland set for warmest May Day of the decade\n\n  13. 29.4.\n\nWorking life\n\n### Inspections reveal poor treatment, underpaying of foreign workers by\nLapland tourism firms\n\n  14. 29.4.\n\nDomestic news\n\n### Finland's baby bust extends to historically large Laestadian families\n\n  15. 29.4.\n\nForeign policy\n\n### Poll: Majority in Finland disapprove of Israel's actions in Gaza\n\n  16. 29.4.\n\nMedia\n\n### Monday's papers: Racist TikTok comments, new strike warnings, and\nTappara's three-peat\n\n  17. 28.4.\n\nDomestic news\n\n### EBU okays Windows95man's nude underwear\n\n  18. 28.4.\n\nDomestic news\n\n### Finland opens national e-library\n\n  19. 28.4.\n\nDomestic news\n\n### Chicago-Helsinki flight lands in New York\n\n  20. 28.4.\n\nDomestic news\n\n### Study reveals teacher bias against immigrant-background students in final\nexam\n\n  * About Yle\n  * Privacy statement\n  * Accessibility\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Careers\n  * Contact us\n\n", "frontpage": false}
