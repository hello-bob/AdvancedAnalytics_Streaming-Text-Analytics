Credit: Felix Tulatz\n\nFar north of the Arctic Circle lies a fjord on the front lines of climate\nchange. Geir Wing Gabrielsen has been visiting this inlet, located on the\nnorthwest side of the Norwegian archipelago Svalbard, since 1981, when he\nfirst came to study the behaviour of Arctic birds. It used to be that each\nyear when the ecotoxicologist would arrive in May or June \u2014 springtime in\nSvalbard \u2014 he could count on one thing: that the fjord would still be locked\nin ice.\n\nBut all of that has changed.\n\nThe Arctic is warming four times as fast as the rest of the world owing to\nclimate change. And because of a quirk of ocean currents, the fjord, called\nKongsfjorden, is warming even faster (see \u2018Current situation\u2019). So much so\nthat, since 2006, it no longer freezes over \u2014 even when the Sun sets during\nthe winter months, between October and February.\n\nThis has completely reshaped the fjord\u2019s ecosystem, according to a study in\nPolish Polar Research published in January^1. Arctic mammals such as beluga\nwhales (Delphinapterus leucas) and ringed seals (Phoca hispida) that once\ncalled the fjord home have left. Meanwhile, more southerly animals including\nAtlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) and Atlantic mackerels (Scomber\nscombrus) have moved in. And new habitats have popped up along the shoreline\nwhere sea ice once suffocated plant growth.\n\nFor researchers such as Gabrielsen, at the University Centre in Svalbard,\nthese changes are met with a sense of loss. But they are also viewed as an\nopportunity. The fjord \u201cwill provide information about how the Arctic will be\nin the future\u201d, Gabrielsen says. And it could help to answer the big questions\nof which species will survive the shifting climate in the Arctic, and how.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that I \u2014 in my time \u2014 have been able to see such dramatic\nchanges,\u201d he says.\n\n## Vanishing Ice\n\nKongsfjorden, meaning \u2018king\u2019s fjord\u2019, is arguably the best-studied Arctic\nfjord in the world. Norway established its first Arctic research station there\nin the 1960s in what was then the mining community of Ny-\u00c5lesund. Since then,\n11 other nations, including Germany, China and India, have set up camp there.\n\nThe density of research activity in the fjord has made it possible to track\nits environmental changes in detail. The eastern reach of Svalbard is pummeled\nby an Arctic current that keeps its frigid temperatures stable. Meanwhile, the\nwestern reach \u2014 where Kongsfjorden sits \u2014 is exposed to an offshoot of the\nAtlantic Gulf Stream. As a result, the fjord\u2019s winter water temperature rose\nfrom 0.3 oC in 2004 to 4 oC in 2017. The most obvious effect of the warmer\nwater hitting Kongsfjorden is the rapid retreat of its glaciers, says Kai\nBischof, a marine biologist at the University of Bremen in Germany.\n\n\u201cIf you go there, like me, every other year, you can really see the changes,\u201d\nBischof adds. He remembers how, in the 1990s, a retreating glacier revealed a\nsurprise: a piece of land once covered in ice and marked on maps as a\npeninsula turned out to be an island. Scientists can now comfortably motor\naround it in boats. \u201cThe rate of change is accelerating,\u201d Bischof says.\n\n## Out with the old, in with the new\n\nKongsfjorden has become something of a pilgrimage for politicians seeking to\nunderstand global warming. Both former UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon and\nformer US secretary of state John Kerry have toured the fjord. The rapidly\nchanging landscape makes it \u201ca place where you can really experience the\nchanging climate through your eyes\u201d, says Bischof.\n\nThe fjord has already taught researchers that the Arctic is susceptible to\ntipping points. When it failed to ice over in 2006, it \u201cwas a great wake-up\ncall\u201d, Gabrielsen says.\n\nBut determining how exactly climate change will scramble the fjord\u2019s ecosystem\nis a bit more difficult.\n\nResearchers have so far recorded the effects on some species. For instance,\nringed seals have mostly left the fjord because, without any sea ice in which\nto build their dens during the spring, their pups were exposed to predatory\nbirds. In 2023, scientists recording the living symphony of the fjord also\nnoted that the frequency of whale songs had diminished, compared with\nSvalbard\u2019s northeast coast^2.\n\nMeanwhile, some opportunistic species have moved onto the scene. Atlantic\nmackerels were first spotted in September 2013. The Atlantic puffin, spotted\noccasionally in the 1980s, is now thriving in Kongsfjorden. And a 19-year\nsurvey^3 of the stomach contents of black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla)\nin the fjord \u2014 a type of seabird in the gull family \u2014 suggests that, since\naround 2006, they have started to feast on a wide array of Atlantic fish that\nseem to have relocated, including Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), capelin\n(Mallotus villosus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua).\n\nThe presence of these southern migrants seems to support the hypothesis that\nthe Arctic will become more and more similar to the North Atlantic Ocean, a\nprocess aptly called Atlantification.\n\n## Arctic adapters\n\nSome newcomers to Kongsfjorden present a challenge for researchers. Luisa\nD\u00fcsedau, a molecular biologist at the Alfred Wegner Institute in Bremerhaven,\nGermany, says that she and her colleagues now need to keep a watch out for\npolar bears (Ursus maritimus) as they walk the shoreline to collect specimens\nsuch as algae and kelp.\n\nOnce upon a time, these massive marine mammals would rarely come into the\nfjord. But with there being less and less sea ice \u2014 which polar bears rely on\nto hunt \u2014 the animals have started shifting tactics. Last summer, according to\nGabrielsen, an unprecedented 20 polar bears and cubs travelled to the fjord to\neat the eggs of common eiders (Somateria mollissima) and barnacle geese\n(Branta leucopsis) nesting along the shore.\n\nPolar bears aren\u2019t the only new thing on the shoreline. Scientists used to\nhave a hard time studying anything growing along the tide line because of the\nsea ice covering it for a large chunk of the year. They also assumed that the\nice would prevent most plants from growing there, because it would scrape away\nanything that tried to take root. Today, thick strands of kelp and algae \u2014\nsome species entirely new to science, according to D\u00fcsedau \u2014 are flourishing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a tiny forest\u201d that forms a home for crabs, worms, snails and many\nother creatures that used to live on the sea floor, says D\u00fcsedau. \u201cIt\u2019s\nblooming.\u201d\n\nThe growth is a reminder that nature can adapt, she says. But she also\nemphasizes that it used to be difficult to know what was actually under the\nsea ice, especially during the harsh conditions of winter.\n\nWith the shifting environment, that is changing. Researchers are trying to\nestablish a baseline for what typically lives in the fjord so that they can\nsystematically bear witness as the ecosystem continues to evolve.\n\nTwo years ago, for instance, polar ecologist Charlotte Havermans, also at the\nAlfred Wegner Institute, travelled with a team to Kongsfjorden to learn\nwhether jellyfish stayed active during the polar winter. The researchers\ndidn\u2019t know whether they would succeed. But upon shining their headlamps into\nthe dark, now-uncovered water, \u201cwe saw so many jellyfish\u201d, she says, \u201cit was\nincredible\u201d. She adds: \u201cThere were so many more species in the winter than we\nthought.\u201d Not only that, but the team found jellyfish DNA in the stomachs of\namphipods \u2014 tiny crustaceans \u2014 also spending the winter in the fjord. It was\nthe first time scientists had spotted Arctic amphipods naturally feeding on\njellyfish, and suggested that the jellies play a much bigger part in the\nwinter food chain that previously thought^4.\n\nKongsfjorden is powerful because it serves as a visual reminder of the power\nthat climate change has to reshape the world, says Gabrielsen. Some 40 years\nago, \u201cI was so fascinated\u201d by the fjord\u2019s beauty, he says. Now, \u201cI have\ngrandchildren, and I wonder if they will be able to see what I have seen\u201d.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01128-y\n\n## References\n\n  1. W\u0119s\u0142awski, J.
