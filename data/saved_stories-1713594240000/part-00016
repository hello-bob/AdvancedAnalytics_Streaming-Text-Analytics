The\nactual requirements vary from state to state and indeed, even within a given\nstate, there's a lot of variation. Here in New York, for instance there are\nsome strong programs that will truly prepare a candidate to teach CS in K12\nbut too many others that are just \"certificate mills\" and the state doesn't\nseem to care.\n\nThe question that I noticed garnering discussion recently wasn't the creation\nof new certification areas but rather, what do we do with the people currently\nteaching CS?\n\nDo we grandfather them in? If so, do we do it indefinitely? Do we force them\nto go through an entire certification program? How about making them sit for\nan exam? How about something else?\n\nI'm writing about this now because on social media I noticed a post from a\nteacher who was just informed they'd have to take the Praxis exam in order to\ncontinue teaching CS. Here, and in other forums I've heard some teachers shrug\nthis off since they did similar or had to do more, and some say that it was\nridiculous to make someone already teaching CS sit for an exam or take\nadditional courses.\n\nI wanted to push back on that.\n\nJust because someone has been teaching CS doesn't mean they should. In New\nYork City, due to their CSforAll initiative hundreds of teachers have been\nthrust into CS classes over the past few years with minimal preparation. Many\nof them have worked super hard and have done a yeoman's job but the majority,\nfrom what I've seen, don't know CS beyond the super basics and haven't really\nhad the opportunity to learn how to teach it.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some who indeed do have a solid CS background and\nany additional exams or coursework are just a waste of time.\n\nOn the third hand, a teacher who has already been certified in some other area\nand has been teaching CS in a public school shouldn't have to pay out of\npocket to take additional coursework or exams.\n\nThe problem is that you can't really assess who knows their stuff and who\ndoesn't just because \"I've been doing it for the past ten years.\"\n\nI'm comfortable saying that even though I'm certified in math, I'm a very\nstrong CS teacher but can I prove it? Test scores don't necessarily prove it.\nI taught for many years at Stuyvesant. Those kids would do well on\nstandardized tests if a potato taught the class. In fact, over my career, I've\nseen, in regents classes where a class taught by a horrible teacher ended up\nwith some of the highest regents scores. There are reasons for this but it's\nnot worth the time to explain here.\n\nShould we look for student testimonial? Maybe but that could just mean that\nthe teacher was popular and unless you're going to find students who are a\nbunch of years out, they might not have the perspective to give a fair\nevaluation.\n\nHow about observation reports from supervisors? Since supervisors rarely know\nCS that won't work either.\n\nIt's a tough nut to crack.\n\nSo, we're left with some states where they're requiring sitting CS teachers\ntake an exam and/or classes which will be an inconvenience or burden on the\nfew teachers that already really know their stuff and other states like NY\nwhere they're fine with unqualified teachers for the next ten years by having\nteachers merely fill out a form, which I wrote about here.\n\nNeither solution is ideal.\n\nProbably the best solution would be to have current CS teachers sit for an\nexam like the CS Praxis exam and have the state pick up the fee. I'm not a big\nfan of standardized exams but as far as they go, the CS Praxis isn't horrible\nand if you pass it, you should have the CS knowledge necessary to teach most\nHigh School CS classes. If you waive the fee, then it isn't really a big ask\nfor a qualified CS teacher. Maybe you also only do this for teachers who've\nbeen teaching CS classes for two or more years or something like that. Combine\na no cost exam with the teachers past CS teaching track record and you\nprobably hit the sweet spot - fair for the teacher and you have a pretty good\nidea that your CS teachers know their stuff.\n\nSeems like an easy common sense solution and it wouldn't cost that much.\nInstead we get states requiring way too much of working teachers or on the\nflip side, allowing teachers with no credentials to teach our students. I\nguess we've learned not to expect more from our governments.\n\n2024-04-19\n\n  * certification\n\n  * #certification\n\n\u00a9 2024 Powered by Hugo, theme Anubis.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
