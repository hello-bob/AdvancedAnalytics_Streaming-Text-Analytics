The content creator known as lilsimsie has almost 2 million\nsubscribers on YouTube and streams herself playing the game on Twitch daily.\nSims\u2019 most popular videos are builds, where viewers watch her create homes in\nwhich every room in the house is built with a different budget or color, for\nexample.\n\nSims is obviously an extreme user of the game, but she says that, in her\nexperience, Simmers who love building frequently use the app to help them\ndesign their IRL spaces. \"People that play The Sims a lot do [use it] when\nthey\u2019re moving into a new place and trying to think about layout and it\u2019s the\neasiest tool. There are tools like that are more professional, but if you\nalready play The Sims and you\u2019re like, where am I going to put my couch? Let\nme real quick build it in The Sims and then move it around a bit,\" she\nexplains, noting that the base level of the game is now free, making it\naccessible for all. \"You can actually see it in 3D, change colors and swap out\nthings so easily. It\u2019s helpful when you\u2019re trying to picture what it\u2019s going\nto be like in real life.\"\n\n^\n\nTwo years ago, when Sims bought a house that needed renovations, she didn\u2019t\njust use the game to design the interiors of her bedroom, bathroom, and\noffice. In the case of the kitchen gut job, she actually showed her Sims build\nto her contractor, who was able to replicate it, even though he\u2019s never played\nthe game.\n\nEven if you haven\u2019t played The Sims yourself, most people have at least heard\nof it. Over the past 20-plus years, it\u2019s become one of the best-selling games\nof all time. (The Sims 4 has reached more than 85 million global players since\nits launch in 2014). Launched in 2000 by Maxis and Electronic Arts, the\nsandbox game was an instant hit, in part because there was no way to win. One\nsimply creates a person (called a \"Sim\") and then their entire world, ushering\nthem through various stages of life and imposed narratives.\n\nBuilt environments were always a key part of The Sims; in fact, game designer\nWill Wright got the idea after his home burned down in the 1991 Oakland\nfirestorm. \"When something like this happens, you get a big picture. Where do\nI want to live? What sort of things do I need to buy? You see your life almost\nas a project in process. When you\u2019re embedded in your day-to-day life you\ndon\u2019t get that perspective,\" he told Berkeleyside in 2011.\n\nInspiration may have sprung from tragedy for Wright, but the game he created\nhas inspired some players to pursue these existential questions\nprofessionally. When Leo, a 30-year-old architect also known as YouTuber\nXFreezerBunnyX, first encountered the game at a mall in the Philippines in\n2005, he says, \"it changed my life.\"\n\nHe quickly became obsessed and his parents took notice of the incredible\nhouses he was designing, inviting over relatives just to take a look. After\nthat, he says, \"I got a lot of encouragement from my parents to become an\narchitect. I definitely would not have considered it if it weren\u2019t for The\nSims, because I don\u2019t think I was really that interested in architecture, to\nbe honest.\"\n\nLeo loves doing speed builds for his audience, and is known for his mastery of\ndifferent styles, creating everything from Parisian rooftop apartments to\ntraditional Japanese temples in the game. Even though it has limitations\u2014like\nonly allowing you to build four stories high\u2014designing in The Sims is a\nreprieve, especially as professional architecture software like Revit and\nAutocad are far more complex and wonky. Leo thinks The Sims helped him become\n\"the guy that did all the plans\" at work; becoming the go-to person for layout\nafter an initial sketch of a project was done. \"Because I kind of got started\nat an early age making spaces for virtual people, I think it definitely got a\nhead start,\" he says.\n\n^\n\nWhen Leo was just starting in his career, he was tasked with mocking up a roof\nrenovation quickly with the client right next to him. Instinctually, he hopped\non The Sims and was able to show them what a gable roof would look like on\ntheir windows. They didn\u2019t seem to mind the format it was presented in, and\nthe project was completed successfully.\n\nFor Allison Maeve, a 25-year-old architectural designer from Cincinnati, Ohio,\nworking as an architect professionally in a \"horrible work environment\"\ncouldn\u2019t compete with the creativity and ease of streaming her builds full-\ntime on Twitch. A key aspect of Maeve\u2019s content is her professional\nbackground, as she uses it to educate her audience about architectural\nstandards, like door clearances and thresholds.\n\nEven though the game does not currently allow for Sims to be in wheelchairs,\nduring her builds, Maeve takes the opportunity to explain things like ADA\nregulations to her followers. \"I did a build [of a library] last week and I\nactually had to change my floor plan because I realized it wasn\u2019t going to be\naccessible to someone in a wheelchair,\" she says, \"It\u2019s fun to question my\ncommunity and we kind of learn together.\"\n\nShe continues: \"I really use The Sims to teach my community about little\narchitecture effects and tips and tricks here and there and they love it.\nWe\u2019re still having fun and we can be cool and funky and creative, but I\u2019m\ngoing to show you how to do a floor plan the right way at least in my\neyes...You can\u2019t just be placing things willy nilly.\"\n\nThough The Sims is made for civilians who play it as a vehicle for fantasy,\nthe designers of the game itself are also making sure players have all the\ntools they need to recreate reality accurately. Sims Art Director Michael\nO\u2019Connor, 50, says \"the research is always king\":\n\n\"What does it take to make a craftsman style home look like a craftsman style\nhome? Besides the wall textures and the roof, how many columns do you need?\nHow many doors do you need? How many windows in a set? We\u2019re always thinking,\nokay, they\u2019re going to tell this story...would they have all the tools to tell\nthat story?\"\n\nThe game is also forward thinking in terms of design trends, releasing new\ncapabilities like the dream home decorator pack. The team works with\nconsultants on what players might want in the future, as a development cycle\nfor a new pack often takes about a year to bring to the finish line.\n\"Cottagecore...that was a big hit,\" O\u2019Connor says. \"But we were kind of\ncrossing our fingers when I was the art director on [the Cottage Living] pack.\nIs this going to be a passing fad by the time [it] comes out?\n\nLeo thinks the game isn\u2019t just tracking trends, it\u2019s setting them. \"I\u2019m seeing\ntrends that were popular in The Sims years ago that are only starting to be\npopular now,\" he claims. \"In my actual architectural practice, those wood slat\nwalls are all over the place. But I first saw them in The Sims [City Living\npack] maybe two or three years ago. And I\u2019m like, now they\u2019re kind of like all\nover the place.\" Though, he adds, \"I\u2019m kind of sick of them at this point.\"\n\nIllustration by Randy Pollak.\n\nRelated Reading:\n\nI\u2019ll Never Be Ashamed of My Everything Chair\n\nThe People Obsessed With Using Obsolete, Y2K Technology\u2014as Decor\n\nAlana Hope Levinson\n\nThe Trend Times columnist.
