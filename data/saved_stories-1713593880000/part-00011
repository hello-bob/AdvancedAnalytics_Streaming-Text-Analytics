Memory-safe languages\n> solve this problem when they are used, but the existing code bases\n> consisting of billions of lines of C and C++ continue to grow, and we need\n> additional bug detection mechanisms. This paper describes a family of tools\n> that detect these two classes of memory-safety bugs, while running in\n> production, at near-zero overhead. These tools combine page-granular guarded\n> allocation and low-rate sampling. In other words, we added an \"if\" statement\n> to a 36-year-old idea and made it work at scale. We describe the basic\n> algorithm, several of its variants and implementations, and the results of\n> multi-year deployments across mobile, desktop, and server applications.\n\nSubjects:| Software Engineering (cs.SE); Programming Languages (cs.PL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2311.09394 [cs.SE]  \n(or arXiv:2311.09394v2 [cs.SE] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.09394arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Marco Elver [view email] [v1] Wed, 15 Nov 2023 21:41:53 UTC (67 KB) [v2]\nSat, 13 Jan 2024 14:42:26 UTC (69 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled GWP-ASan: Sampling-Based Detection of Memory-\nSafety Bugs in Production, by Kostya Serebryany and 11 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.SE\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2311\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.PL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
