The plea deal required Zhao to step down as\nBinance chief executive and accept a $150 million fine, and for the company to\npay a $4.3 billion penalty.\n\n\u201cZhao\u2019s willful violation of US law was no accident or oversight,\u201d the US\nDepartment of Justice wrote in a court filing ahead of the sentencing. \u201cHe\nmade a business decision that violating US law was the best way to attract\nusers, build his company, and line his pockets.\u201d\n\nIn the filing, prosecutors requested that Zhao receive a 36-month prison\nsentence, pointing to the need to \u201cdeter others who are tempted to build\nfortunes and business empires by breaking US law.\u201d Zhao\u2019s legal counsel asked\nfor probation, on the grounds that no defendant in a comparable case \u201chas ever\nbeen sentenced to incarceration.\u201d\n\nIn coming to an appropriate sentence for Zhao, the judge was required to \u201clook\npast the guidelines\u201d and factor in context beyond the facts of the underlying\ncrime, says Daniel Richman, a professor of law at Columbia University and\nformer federal prosecutor. That includes the character of the defendant, the\nlikelihood of recidivism, past infractions, and other factors.\n\nIn a letter to the judge in advance of the hearing, Zhao apologized for his\nconduct and accepted responsibility for the failure to establish an effective\ncompliance program at Binance. \u201cWords cannot explain how deeply I regret my\nchoices that result in me being before the Court,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPlease accept my\nassurance that this will be my only encounter with the criminal justice\nsystem.\u201d\n\nZhao\u2019s willingness to \u201cplead guilty and take responsibility\u201d will have counted\nin his favor, says Richman, but evidence of his flagrant disregard for the law\nwill have weighed heavily on the judge. \u201cWhen you have somebody who flouted\nthe law in such a sustained way, one could expect that respect for the law\nwill loom large in the sentence the judge imposes,\u201d says Richman.\n\nZhao is the second crypto figurehead to face criminal sentencing in the US in\nas many months. On March 28, Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF, founder of bankrupt\ncrypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Before their\nrespective falls from grace, the pair vied for control of the exchange market\nand reportedly sparred frequently. But the similarities between the cases end\nthere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an easy comparison, but an imperfect one,\u201d says Daniel Silva, an\nattorney at law firm Buchalter and former US prosecutor. \u201cCZ pleaded guilty to\nnot following the law as required of a financial institution executive. SBF\nwas different: He was improperly using customer funds, gained through\nfraudulent statements and material omissions of fact.\u201d\n\nIn their own presentence filing, Zhao\u2019s counsel made a thinly-veiled reference\nto the distinction. \u201cMr. Zhao has been convicted only of an AML [anti-money-\nlaundering] compliance failure,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHe has not defrauded any\ninvestors, there has been no misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Their\nclient, they appeared to be saying, is no SBF.\n\nZhao will not be required to forfeit the wealth he has accrued as founder of\nBinance as part of his sentence. Although he departed Binance in November,\nZhao is reported to retain an estimated 86 percent stake in the exchange and\ncontinues to be worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe DOJ, which until last year had secured few landmark crypto convictions,\nwill nonetheless celebrate the conviction. \u201cWhether people criticize the\nsentence as too light, it sends a healthy message,\u201d says Silva. The aim is to\n\u201cdeter the next crypto or financial institution CEO from thumbing their nose\nat anti-money-laundering regulations.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nI Tried These AI-Based Productivity Tools.
