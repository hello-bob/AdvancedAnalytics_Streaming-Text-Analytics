However, LLMs\n> still suffer from significant security and privacy issues. For example, LLMs\n> might expose user privacy from hacking attacks or targeted prompts. To\n> address this problem, this paper introduces a novel machine unlearning\n> framework into LLMs. Our objectives are to make LLMs not produce harmful,\n> hallucinatory, or privacy-compromising responses, while retaining their\n> standard output capabilities. To accomplish this, we use an evaluative model\n> to pinpoint dialogues needing unlearning. We also establish a distance loss\n> to function as the model's negative loss, diverting it from previous\n> undesirable outputs. Furthermore, we determine the expected output's cluster\n> mean to formulate a positive loss, directing the model's outputs toward\n> preferable outcomes without compromising its reasoning abilities and\n> performance. Experimental results show that our approach effectively meets\n> unlearning objectives without substantially compromising model performance.\n\nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.16841 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.16841v1 [cs.CR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16841arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Kongyang Chen [view email] [v1] Sat, 3 Feb 2024 05:14:56 UTC (228 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Machine Unlearning in Large Language Models, by\nKongyang Chen and 6 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
