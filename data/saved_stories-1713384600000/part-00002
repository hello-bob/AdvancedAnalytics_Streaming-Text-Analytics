The next generation of the Atlas program\nbuilds on decades of research and furthers our commitment to delivering the\nmost capable, useful mobile robots. An advanced control system and state-of-\nthe-art hardware give the robot the power and balance to demonstrate advanced\nathletics and agility.\n\nWe use Atlas to explore the potential of the humanoid form factor, leveraging\nthe robot\u2019s whole body to move with grace, speed, and dexterity. Atlas\ndemonstrates our efforts to develop the next generation of robots with the\nmobility, perception, and intelligence needed to be commonplace in our lives.\n\n0:31\n\n1:38\n\n0:13\n\n0:10\n\nAthletic Intelligence\n\nConnections between perception and control allow Atlas to adapt\u2014quite\nliterally\u2014on the fly.\n\nDynamic Manipulation\n\nUsing both hands and its full range of motion, Atlas can interact with the\nworld in meaningful ways.\n\nReal-Time Perception\n\nAtlas sees its surroundings with depth sensors to generate point clouds of the\nenvironment.\n\nModel-Predictive Control\n\nAtlas uses models of the robot\u2019s dynamics to predict how its motion will\nevolve over time and adjust accordingly.\n\n1 / 4\n\n## Innovation and R&D\n\nR&D is never boring at Boston Dynamics. We expand our robots\u2019 mobility,\ndexterity, perception, and intelligence in leaps and bounds\u2014with the aim to\nmake robots useful in our everyday lives. Discover how our legacy of\ninnovation informs our real-world solutions.\n\nOur Products\n\nLegacy Robots\n\n## We\u2019re engineering a better robot\n\nEvery centimeter of Atlas is meticulously designed, manufactured, and\ncalibrated to bring out the best performance possible.\n\n###### High Power\n\nA custom battery and one of the world\u2019s most compact hydraulic systems enable\nhigh power for Atlas to deliver impressive feats of mobility.\n\nActuation Hydraulic\n\nJoints 28\n\n###### Dynamic\n\nAtlas\u2019 advanced control algorithms enable the robot to plan complex whole body\nmovements while accounting for the environment.\n\nSpeed 2.5 m/s\n\n###### Lightweight\n\nAtlas uses a mixture of titanium and aluminum 3D printed parts to give it the\nstrength-to-weight ratio necessary for leaps and somersaults.\n\nHeight 1.5 m\n\nWeight 89 kg\n\n## Inside our Robotics Lab\n\nOur robots aren\u2019t designed overnight\u2014our R&D team have spent countless hours\ntesting and iterating on new builds or ideas.
