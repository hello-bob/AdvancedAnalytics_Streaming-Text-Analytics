(AP) \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency cleared the way Friday\nfor a higher blend of ethanol to be sold nationwide for the third summer in a\nrow, citing global conflicts that it says are putting pressure on the world\u2019s\nfuel supply.\n\nThe agency announced an emergency waiver that will exempt gasoline blended\nwith 15% ethanol from an existing summertime ban. Gasoline with 10% ethanol is\nalready sold nationwide, but the higher blend has been prohibited in the\nsummer because of concerns it could worsen smog during warm weather.\n\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan said the waiver was warranted because of\n\u201cRussia\u2019s unjustified, unprovoked, and unconscionable war against Ukraine\u201d and\nthe ongoing conflict in the Middle East, which he said are putting pressure on\nthe global fuel supply. He said the diminished U.S. refining capacity is also\na factor.\n\nThe biofuels industry and politicians in the Midwestern states where ethanol\nis produced from corn praised the EPA\u2019s decision. They have portrayed ethanol\nas a product that helps farmers, reduces prices at the pump and lessens\ngreenhouse gases because the fuel burns more cleanly than gasoline.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThai plastics firm will pay $20 million to settle with U.S. over Iran\nsanctions violations\n\nAttack blamed on IS militants kills 22 pro-government fighters in central\nSyria\n\n3 dead amid heavy flooding caused by record rain in the UAE\n\n\u201cAllowing uninterrupted sales of E15 will help extend gasoline supplies,\nprevent fuel shortages, protect air quality and reduce carbon emissions,\u201d said\nRenewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds called the decision \u201ca huge victory for Iowa farmers,\nAmerican energy independence, and consumers.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists and others, however, have said increased ethanol production\ncan increase carbon releases because it results in more corn production,\nleading to increased use of fertilizer and greater releases of nitrate.\nSynthetic and natural fertilizers also are a leading source of water\npollution.\n\nIowa leads the nation in ethanol production, followed by Nebraska, Illinois,\nSouth Dakota, Minnesota and Indiana.\n\nMost gasoline sold across the country today is blended with 10% ethanol,\nthough 15% blends are becoming increasingly common, especially in the Midwest.\n\nThe EPA has approved sales of E15 for cars and trucks manufactured after 2000.\nThe RFA estimates that the higher blend will cost consumers more than 25 cents\na gallon less than 10% ethanol.\n\nEarlier this year, the EPA permanently approved year-round E15 sales in eight\nMidwestern states, starting next year. The waiver announced Friday is\ntemporary and only applies this year.\n\nJOSH FUNK\n\nJosh covers railroads & Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\n\ntwitter\n\nmailto\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nMore human remains believed those of missing woman wash up on beach\n\nUndo\n\nUrlaub in \u00d6sterreichAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Der Rosalia-Radwanderweg in \u00d6sterreichUrlaub in \u00d6sterreich:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUndo\n\nWoman pleads guilty for role in 4 slayings stemming from custody dispute,\nsentenced to life\n\nUndo\n\nTrump loses bid to halt Jan. 6 lawsuits while he fights criminal charges in\nthe 2020 election case\n\nUndo\n\nNew York man pleads guilty to sending threats to state attorney general and\nTrump civil case judge\n\nUndo\n\nAlabama court authorizes executing a man convicted of killing a delivery\ndriverThe Alabama Supreme Court has authorized executing a man convicted of\nkilling a delivery driver who stopped at an ATM in 1998.AP News\n\nUndo\n\nMan charged with 4 University of Idaho deaths was out for a drive that night,\nhis attorneys sayEthan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee\nGoncalves were stabbed to death at a rental home near the university campus in\nMoscow, Idaho, early on Nov. 13, 2022.AP News\n\nUndo\n\nAd Content\n\nAdvertisement: thermondo\n\nHausbesitzer aufgepasst: Die Revolution auf dem W\u00e4rmepumpenmarktAdvertisement:\nthermondo\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Forge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenAdvertisement: Forge Of Empires\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: eToro\n\nMarkteinblicke 2024 f\u00fcr InvestorenAdvertisement: eToro\n\nUndo\n\nAd Content\n\nAdvertisement: thermondo\n\nDieser Heizungsbauer revolutioniert den W\u00e4rmepumpenmarktAdvertisement:\nthermondo\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: eToro\n\nNavigation durch die M\u00e4rkte im Jahr 2024: 5 Assets, die Sie dieses Jahr im\nBlick behalten solltenAdvertisement: eToro\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Checkfox\n\nRiesa - Revolution bei PKV-Tarifen: So halbieren Sie Ihren\nBeitragAdvertisement: Checkfox\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Forge Of Empires\n\nDas Strategiespiel des Jahres auf deinem PCKein Download.
