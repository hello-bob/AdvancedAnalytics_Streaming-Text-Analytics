It turns out that inducing altered states of\nconsciousness, in the right setting, can help people work through depression,\nanxiety, and addiction, as well as navigate major life transitions such as\nloss or terminal illness.\n\nBut what if we could engineer these altered states without any external\nsubstances or stimuli? Enter the jhanas, a growing meditation trend that\u2019s\nmade its way into some corners of tech. Practitioners claim they can induce\nextremely blissful mental states that rival life\u2019s peak experiences, available\nat any time with enough concentration.\n\nJhanas, if they are as accessible and transformative as they seem, create new\ninroads to understanding, and improving, how our brains work. By revealing the\nmind\u2019s potential to transform our subjective experience, they point toward a\nradically expanded notion of what happiness can be \u2014 and where it comes from.\n\nFatchurofi Muhammad\n\nThe jhanas, which derive from Buddhism, are eight states of consciousness that\nallegedly produce strong feelings in the body and mind. They can be accessed\nthrough a meditation technique that involves concentrating the mind on an\nobject, then gradually deepening the sensation that arises.\n\nModern practitioners tend to focus their practice on the first four jhanas, or\nthe \u201cform jhanas,\u201d which roughly progress from euphoria (first jhana, or J1)\nto joy (J2) to contentment (J3) to peacefulness or equanimity (J4). While the\nhigher jhanas (J5 through J8), sometimes called the \u201cdeep\u201d or \u201cformless\u201d\njhanas, are more dissociative, the first four (J1 through J4) bring about\npalpably positive sensations, which have a clearer instrumental purpose.\n\nStephen Zerfas, cofounder of Jhourney, a company that aims to help more people\nexperience jhanas, describes them as \u201cthe opposite of a panic attack.\u201d Instead\nof an escalating anxiety loop, jhanas are an escalating pleasure loop, the\nintensity of which is comparable \u2014 depending on whom you ask \u2014 to an orgasm,\nan MDMA-induced cuddle puddle, or the thrill of new love.\n\nJhanas were first described centuries ago, but they\u2019ve only recently\nexperienced a modern revival. According to the suttas, the Buddhist\nscriptures, the Buddha entered the first jhana spontaneously as a child, and\nlater encouraged the pursuit of the jhanas as a \u201cpath to awakening.\u201d But as\nBuddhism spread and became more formalized, jhanas were cordoned off as a rare\nfeat, attainable only by monks after years of advanced practice. The\nVisuddhimagga, a fifth-century Buddhist text, written more than 800 years\nafter the Buddha\u2019s death, describes the difficulty of entering into the\njhanas: \u201conly one in a hundred or a thousand\u201d can successfully perform each\nstep.\n\nBy the 10th century, jhanas had fallen almost entirely out of practice.\nTheravada, the oldest school of Buddhism, had chosen to deemphasize the role\nof meditation and self-discovery, and instead focus on the moral aspects of\nthe Buddha\u2019s teachings. It was only in 18th-century Myanmar that Buddhist\nleaders began to reintroduce meditation as a way to strengthen and preserve\nculture in the face of British colonialism. This renewed interest in\nmeditation grew into what is termed the Vipassana movement in the 1950s, a\nlineage that persists in the Western mindfulness movement today.\n\nBut while they embraced meditation, Vipassana practitioners discouraged the\npursuit of jhanas as a path to insight. Many teachers viewed them as a\nhedonistic distraction from \u201cliberation,\u201d a state where pleasure is believed\nto be irrelevant. Even today, jhanas occupy something of a dissident place in\nmost meditation circles, which emphasize transcending beyond the self, instead\nof doing things for the self.\n\nAyya Khema, a Buddhist nun and German Holocaust survivor who discovered\nmeditation while traveling through Asia, saw them differently. In the 1980s,\nshe began teaching the jhanas as a \u201clost art\u201d that could help practitioners\nattain the wisdom they sought. But Khema\u2019s interpretation of the jhanas \u2014\nusing the suttas as a reference \u2014 differed from the doctrine taught in the\nVisuddhimagga. Instead of expecting Buddhists to progress through all eight\njhanas, Khema thought that even experiencing the first jhana would be\nbeneficial to one\u2019s practice.\n\nKhema set in motion a wave of \u201csutta-inspired\u201d jhana teachers in the decades\nthat followed, including Leigh Brasington, author of Right Concentration: A\nPractical Guide to the Jhanas; Bhante Vimalaramsi, who founded the Tranquil\nWisdom Insight Meditation (TWIM) movement; and Rob Burbea, author of Seeing\nThat Frees: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising. Each teacher has\ntheir own philosophy, but all emphasize focusing on the more attainable first\nfour \u201clight jhanas,\u201d instead of progressing through the more advanced \u201cdeep\njhanas.\u201d\n\nAmong meditation communities, there is still debate as to whether today\u2019s\nversion is a watery imitation of the original practice that was reserved for\nadvanced meditators. But it is impossible to oversee a practice that no one\ncan be prevented from trying on their own. Western-style yoga, for example,\ndoesn\u2019t look very much like how it was practiced in 10th-century India, but it\nimproves the mental and physical health of millions of people every day. These\nbenefits, along with yoga\u2019s accessibility, helped it spread far beyond its\noriginal context.\n\nIn spreading awareness of the jhanas, modern teachers also attracted a\ncommunity of those who \u2014 like the Buddha \u2014 had organically discovered these\nstates, but either didn\u2019t know what they were, or were discouraged by their\nteachers from exploring them. This \u201camateurization\u201d of the jhanas, when it\ncollided with the internet, is how it found purchase among a growing group of\ntechnologists.\n\n***\n\nNick Cammarata, an artificial intelligence researcher with a gentle\ndisposition, is an experienced meditator who describes himself as having an\nunusually high baseline mood. As a child, he was bullied for his positivity\nuntil he learned to assume an outwardly depressed affect \u2014 what he describes\nas \u201chiding [my] rapture under a hoodie.\u201d\n\nCammarata first heard about the jhanas through the Qualia Research Institute,\na network of researchers that studies consciousness. Its cofounder, Andr\u00e9s\nG\u00f3mez Emilsson, classifies the jhanas as an \u201cexotic state,\u201d by which he means\nan unusual or extreme subjective experience whose properties might help us to\nreverse engineer consciousness. Just as black holes and plasma help us\nunderstand how matter works, jhanas or psychedelics could do the same for\nconsciousness.\n\nIntrigued, Cammarata tried, and failed, to experience the jhanas for several\nyears, before taking time to \u2014 as he describes it \u2014 unblock himself\nspiritually through therapy and other forms of meditation, which quieted his\ninternal voice (\u201cmonkey mind too loud\u201d). In the summer of 2021, he returned to\nhis practice and found himself in first jhana. Surprised to find that no one\nhe knew had written about the jhanas already, Cammarata decided to share his\nexperience publicly. In a series of tweets, he described the jhanas as \u201cclean\njoy,\u201d a \u201csensory overload of pleasure and serenity,\u201d and the \u201cfreest of free\nlunches\u201d in terms of their accessibility and benefit.\n\nSome scoffed at Cammarata\u2019s claims, comparing the jhanas to telekinesis or\nclairvoyance. A few people asked for biometric data as evidence. \u201dWhen nerdy\ntypes start talking about \u2018amazing sex,\u2019 I can't help but roll my eyes,\u201d wrote\none commenter on a blog post. \u201cSorry, but I don't really value your opinion on\nthis.\u201d Others, intrigued by the promise of self-induced euphoria, eagerly\nwanted to learn how to do it.\n\nCammarata\u2019s tweets sparked wider interest among the This Part of Twitter\n(tpot) community and its associated touchpoints. Tpot \u2014 sometimes used\ninterchangeably with \u201cpostrationalism\u201d \u2014 is a loose subculture, notorious for\nits love of introspection, that grew out of the tech-adjacent rationalist\nmovement. Where rationalists emphasize the use of logic to govern their\ndecision-making, tpot believes that \u201cvibes\u201d and feelings are unaccounted for\nby pure logic and advocate taking them more seriously.\n\nIn October 2022, psychiatrist and rationalist writer Scott Alexander featured\nCammarata\u2019s experience on his blog, Astral Codex Ten. Last year, Bayeslord, a\npseudonymous cofounder of the techno-optimist movement effective\naccelerationism, uploaded a series of Rob Burbea\u2019s talks to YouTube, where\nthey now have more than 80,000 views. Lady Red Beacham, a pseudonymous Twitter\nuser, started a Discord community for the jhana-curious, which grew to over\n400 members. Many who joined had been meditating without formal instruction,\nand only realized they had experienced the jhanas after reading Cammarata\u2019s\ntweets.\n\nZerfas, the Jhourney cofounder, is one such person who discovered the jhanas\nby accident. He began meditating five years ago as a way to cope during a\ndifficult time. Ten months into his practice, while on a retreat, Zerfas\nstumbled into a euphoric \u201cpeak experience.\u201d After many more hours of practice,\nhe realized he could replicate the experience at will. He continued to\nmeditate this way daily for two years, not knowing what the jhanas were, until\nhe read Cammarata\u2019s tweets, turned to his then-girlfriend (now wife), and\nremarked, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what that is!\u201d\n\nInstead of spreading jhanas through teaching, as Brasington or Burbea did,\nZerfas \u2014 a former software engineer and management consultant \u2014 took the tech-\nminded approach. Jhourney\u2019s physical product is currently in development, but\nthey plan to use neurofeedback \u2014 signals that tell users how they are\nprogressing, based on evaluation of their neural activity \u2014 to help people\nexperience jhanas more deterministically.\n\nAs part of their research and development process, Zerfas and his colleagues\nbegan hosting weeklong retreats to teach jhanas to beginners. Their retreats\noffer a secular approach, focusing on practical technique \u2014 closer to\nsomething that pop-sci neuroscientist Andrew Huberman might evangelize rather\nthan one described by a Buddhist monk. Attendees do high-intensity workouts\nand cold plunges to enhance their relaxation and focus. They also provide\noptional self-assessments, which help Jhourney\u2019s team understand how one\u2019s\npersonality and prior experiences might influence their jhana practice.\n\nZerfas had initially hoped that something like 30% of attendees would find\nsuccess in accessing jhanas. He was stunned to find that their retreats\nyielded 70% success rates with fewer than 40 hours of practice \u2014 without using\ntechnology at all. Jhourney\u2019s early success suggests that, as modern\npractitioners have claimed, self-inducing blissful states may be much easier\nthan previously thought.\n\nSo far, scientific research has been slow to catch up. There is some limited\nevidence to support the idea that the jhanas engender a distinct neurological\nexperience. An early study, from 2013, used fMRI and EEG data to show that its\nsubject had stimulated his own dopamine/opioid reward system while in jhana \u2014\nwithout the use of any external stimuli, such as rhythmic movement or mental\nimagery. A 2019 study of 29 meditators found that its subjects displayed brain\nactivity during jhanas similar to that during nonrapid eye movement (nREM)\nsleep, despite being conscious.\n\nMost recently, Matthew Sacchet, who oversees the Meditation Research Program\nat Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, coauthored an\nfMRI case study in 2023 that showed that its subject experienced \u201cdistinctive\npatterns of brain activity\u201d during jhanas that mapped to an altered state of\nconsciousness, such as being comatose or under the influence of psychedelics.\n\u201cOur study presents the most rigorous evidence yet,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cthat\njhana practice deconstructs consciousness, offering unique insights into\nconsciousness and significant implications for mental health and well-being.\u201d\n\nBut study recruitment remains a challenge to researchers. Two of the three\njhana studies described above only had one subject, due to the difficulty of\nrecruiting practitioners who can reliably enter and sustain a jhanic state, as\nwell as varying definitions of what constitutes the jhanas. Authors of the\n2013 paper lamented that they had found \u201cthe only person in the [United\nStates] who had the requisite training in jhana who was willing to submit to\nthe experimental protocol.\u201d\n\nSeen from this perspective, Jhourney looks as much like an applied research\norganization as a tech company. Their growing body of retreat attendees might\nhelp us substantiate and further investigate jhana practitioners\u2019 claims. And\nJhourney\u2019s own data, both qualitative (from retreat attendee reports) and\nquantitative (they\u2019ve collected a large EEG dataset from an early pilot, and\nplan to do more) could provide clues about what happens inside a person\u2019s\nbrain during jhanas \u2014 and how to help more people experience them.\n\n***\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area has a long history as the playground of\nconsciousness. For decades, many of its resident technologists have been both\nhabitually curious about \u2014 and determined to master \u2014 the inside of their\nbrains. This sort of cerebral hedonism is hardly visible to outsiders, in the\nway that visitors to Miami might be dazzled by the splash of colorful cars and\nclothing, or one to New York City might marvel at the richness of experience\nin a single block. Instead, tech\u2019s otherworldly adventures take place inside\nits members\u2019 minds, scattered throughout the hills and forests and Victorian\nhomes that make up San Francisco.\n\nIt was here that I found myself driving a rental car through the Napa Valley\nto a private retreat center to try to experience the jhanas for myself, under\nJhourney\u2019s guidance. After parking beneath the redwoods, I was shown to my\ncabin, a sparse but clean room with two beds, a nightstand, and a naked light\nbulb.\n\nAs I unpacked my things and walked to the dining hall, I felt a bit silly,\nwondering if my love of adventure had tugged me too far. Zerfas had invited me\nto a retreat after I\u2019d interviewed him for this piece, which I politely\ndeclined twice. A week was too long to be away from my obligations at home,\nand I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be worth it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t think the jhanas were real, as so many other skeptics\nseemed to. I believed that the experience had been transformative for everyone\nI\u2019d spoken to \u2014 for them. But I didn\u2019t have much personal interest in\nmeditation. I was focused and happy in my day-to-day; I had never felt the\npull of Netflix binges and phone notifications; there was no looming crisis in\nmy life that I needed to solve for.\n\nAfter Zerfas persisted a third time, however, my curiosity got the best of me,\nand I relented. Like those I\u2019d interviewed, I enjoyed thinking of my brain as\na machine I could tinker with, and this was an experience I hadn\u2019t tried yet.\nMy goal was simple: I wanted to see what my brain could do.\n\nOther than a five-day trip to a Zen monastery I\u2019d taken with a friend nearly a\ndecade ago, I had no prior meditation experience. There, the morning bell\nsounded before sunrise. We ate porridge with nutritional yeast. We were taught\nto bow to each other, to place our meditation cushions just so, to step into\nthe Zendo with the left foot, not the right. My legs went numb as I sat cross-\nlegged for hours. Meditation was expected to be uncomfortable; that was what\nwe were there for. One teacher coached us, during a particularly long sit, to\nuse our physical pain as fodder for spiritual inquiry.\n\nMy Jhourney retreat had none of this austerity. Zerfas and his cofounder, Alex\nGruver, who facilitated the retreat together, feel that exploring the jhanas\nshould be fun. Meditation was expected to be comfortable; lying down with\nblankets was encouraged. The first day and a half was social, with group\nactivities like a sound bath and cacao ceremony. Only after did we settle into\n\u201cnoble silence\u201d \u2014 a mutual agreement not to speak to or acknowledge other\nattendees, except during group Q&A \u2014 for the rest of the week.\n\nEach morning, I joined a group of 10 other attendees for a group \u201csit,\u201d or\nmeditation \u2014 followed by light instruction and Q&A, where we\u2019d help one\nanother debug our solo sessions. Then we\u2019d go off to meditate on our own for\nthe day, before reconvening for another, similarly structured evening session.\n\nZerfas and Gruver offered general guidance on the methods that were likely to\nfacilitate success with the jhanas. The basic technique was finding a\n\u201cmeditation object\u201d \u2014 something or someone that sparked a pleasant sensation \u2014\nthen trying to intensify and heighten that sensation. But we were told to\nexperiment, because certain techniques were likely to work better for some\nthan others. This, too, was a marked departure from the typical dogma of\nmeditation retreats.\n\nI felt like a scientist, traipsing off to my cabin each morning to lie on my\nspare bed for 45-60-minute \u201csits,\u201d walk around the grounds, then record my\nobservations in a notebook, until it was time for dinner. In the evenings, we\nlogged our experiences using presupplied Chromebooks. I had a daily\n\u201cinterview,\u201d a one-on-one conversation with a Jhourney facilitator to discuss\nwhat I\u2019d learned, get feedback, and figure out what to try the next day. The\ndynamic felt closer to that of a researcher and principal investigator \u2014 which\nI vastly preferred \u2014 than a meditation student seeking the wisdom of a guru.\n\nI\u2019ll cut to the chase: In my first hour of practice, I found myself in first\njhana \u2014 the most euphoric of the jhanas. The experience felt like an MDMA roll\nhitting at the exact moment of a bass drop. My hands and chest tingled; my\nhead snapped back; I felt a distinct \u201cpushing\u201d up through the center of my\nspine. Eventually, the sensations dissipated, and I opened my eyes, feeling\npeaceful, as I watched the rain patter against the windows.\n\nDespite the intensity of my experience, I wasn\u2019t sure that I had really\nexperienced the jhanas, mostly because \u2014 after all the buildup of expectations\n\u2014 it seemed crazy to have entered them so quickly. In my first interview with\nZerfas and Gruver, I explained what I\u2019d observed, including what I could only\ndescribe as a \u201ccalm state\u201d that followed the euphoric bliss. Zerfas perked up\nand asked a few questions that reminded me of being at an eye doctor. Was it\n\u201cjoy\u201d I\u2019d experienced, or \u201ceuphoria\u201d? Was it \u201ccalm,\u201d or \u201ccontentedness\u201d? Then\nhe nodded, like a doctor who\u2019d finished assessing his patient\u2019s symptoms.\n\nZerfas asked if I wanted to continue tinkering on my own or whether I wanted\nhis \u201cthought dump.\u201d I hesitated. Delving deep into my brain felt like\nexploring a personal terra incognita; I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted anyone else\u2019s\nmap. I had intentionally avoided reading others\u2019 instructions or descriptions\nof the jhanic states. It was the not-knowing that made these expeditions so\nexciting. After wavering a bit, I asked Zerfas for his thoughts, but he seemed\nto sense my desire to explore without narrativization and wisely kept his\nfeedback vague, telling me to keep experimenting and having fun.\n\nThe next day, I replicated the progression of sensations during each sit. I\nwas now certain that what I\u2019d experienced was the first and second jhana,\nwhich Zerfas confirmed in my next interview. I had also begun to discern a\nnew, third, \u201cpost-calm\u201d sensation, which I was struggling to locate in my\nbody. Zerfas and Gruver helped me find the nuance and gradient of each state \u2014\nnoticing how the sensations changed, until I found myself in a subjectively\ndifferent experience \u2014 until I realized I\u2019d discovered the next two jhanic\nstates, J3 and J4.\n\nOnce I got comfortable with running up and down states J1 through J4 \u2014 I\ncalled this \u201cpracticing my scales,\u201d as with music \u2014 I unexpectedly tipped\nmyself into J5, floating out of my body to gaze at an infinite space. After an\ninitial fear that I had somehow died, I learned to expand J5 into J6, then J7,\neach of which was more disembodied than the next. Halfway into the retreat,\nafter a particularly memorable session \u2014 my mind exploding into indescribable\nbeauty, followed by nothingness, that exceeded the intensity of some\npsychedelic experiences \u2014 I laid in my spare bed, half-curled in my blanket\nand blinking in the sunlight, and decided it was time to go home and process\nwhat I\u2019d learned.\n\n***\n\nWhen I first arrived at Jhourney\u2019s retreat, I had a clear objective in mind:\nto experience the first jhana. J1 produces overwhelmingly strong bliss effects\nand is the main conversation piece with regards to the jhanas\u2019 purported\nbenefits. I thought that if I could accomplish this goal, I would be done with\nmy practice.\n\nI later realized that was a mistake. The power of the jhanas was not that they\noffered a temporary escape from our otherwise pallid lives \u2014 as we typically\nthink of pleasurable vices \u2014 but that, with repeated practice, they somehow\nelevated my everyday life to be more jhana-like.\n\nWithin two days, my relationship with J1 progressed from the gleeful euphoria\nof an MDMA roll to being overwhelmed by its saccharine quality. I began to\nfeel a bit run down \u2014 not dissimilar to how one might feel if they were\nrolling three times a day. \u201cHelp!\u201d I tapped into the Chromebook during my\nevening reflection. I didn\u2019t want to experience J1 anymore. It was too much. I\nhad developed an intuitive muscle memory that was now causing me to pop into\nJ1 involuntarily, grinning like a fool as my thirsty brain guzzled pleasure\nwith abandon, which was, I wrote at the time, \u201ccreeping me out.\u201d But in order\nto access the higher jhanas, which I still wanted to explore, I had to pass\nthrough J1. I felt trapped.\n\nThat evening, at Zerfas\u2019s encouragement, I went on a walk with one of\nJhourney\u2019s alumni, who were at the retreat to provide peer support. She\nassured me that what I was experiencing was normal, and that my central\nnervous system would quickly acclimate. She was right. By the next day, J1 had\nmellowed out to a state that was enjoyable, but no longer stifling.\n\nI had thought that attaining J1 would be the height of my experience. Within a\nfew days, that \u201cpeak experience\u201d had ceased to be all that interesting. At\nfirst I thought it was because my ability to access J1 had diminished, but\nthen I noticed something strange. Even when I wasn\u2019t in the jhanic states, my\nworld had become noticeably ... boosted, somehow. Colors were brighter,\nvisuals sharper, sounds sweeter. When I retreated to my cabin in the evenings,\nI smiled, warmed by the cozy light. I listened to the chorus of frogs croaking\nin the rain at night and felt happy that they were happy. On my drive to the\nairport, I radiated piti \u2014 the Pali word for euphoric energy \u2014 as I cruised\nNorthern California\u2019s winding roads, watching a rainbow beam onto the soft,\nverdant hills below.\n\nWaltzing through San Francisco International Airport to catch a red-eye, I was\nsure now that something was different. I had worried that leaving the retreat\nwould be a depressing return to reality. Instead, I felt like I was in a\ncommercial from the 1950s, donning an apron and pouring orange juice for my\nhusband with a twirl. I wasn\u2019t outwardly doing anything differently, but\neveryone I interacted with laughed and smiled and wished me the best. Several\nstrangers complimented my energy. The TSA officer grinned at me as he took my\nFlorida driver\u2019s license. \u201cWell\u201d \u2014 he checked my name \u2014 \u201cNadia,\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s\nsomething in the water in Florida, isn\u2019t there!\u201d\n\nI messaged Beacham, who had once tweeted about how her jhanic practice had\nmade a trip to Macy\u2019s feel \u201cas intense as sex.\u201d \u201cNow I completely understand\nyour Macy\u2019s tweet,\u201d I wrote. \u201cNever has a walk through SFO been so luminously\nradiant!\u201d I felt ridiculous typing those words. She called me, laughing. \u201cNow\nyou\u2019re one of us!\u201d But, she added more soberly that in her view, the best part\nof jhanas wasn\u2019t just the good feelings they brought to one\u2019s life. It\u2019s that\nthey were a tool for clearing away the cobwebs, making it possible to examine\none\u2019s life more impassively.\n\nMany practitioners believe there is a natural path from experiencing the\njhanas to \u201cinsight,\u201d or meaningful learnings that improve one\u2019s life.\nAccording to Brasington, the jhanas teacher, jhanas work by \u201cquiet[ing] down\nthe normal ego-making processes\u201d so that you can see the world as it is,\ninstead of \u201cin terms of your advantages and disadvantages.\u201d^ 1 Another theory\nis that by giving people a taste of how happiness feels, they will find ways\nto bring themselves closer to this ideal state. Mechanistically, this is not\nunlike finding role models or surrounding oneself with like-minded peers \u2014\nbeing around greatness makes us want to be great. Or, as Zerfas put it: \u201cYou\ncome for the bliss and stay for the personality change.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what sort of insights I wanted to explore. I had attended the\nJhourney retreat primarily to satisfy my intellectual curiosity about a\nstrange phenomenon. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but notice ... things. Why, for\nexample, had I been so quick to pick up the jhanas? I had thought of myself as\na sort of lovably grumpy person, not particularly prone to cheerfulness. But\nmaybe this aspect of myself wasn\u2019t as immutable as I\u2019d thought, and my\nquickness to annoyance made it just as easy for me to find joy \u2014 I just had to\nflip the switch in the other direction.\n\nBeacham offered another prompt. \u201cSo ... so what is it that led you to stand\nhere at this moment, talking on the phone to me from SFO after leaving early\nfrom a jhanas retreat?\u201d I stopped, suddenly unsure how to answer, feeling the\nfluorescence of the lights and hearing the twang of the loudspeaker for the\nfirst time since I\u2019d arrived.\n\n***\n\nIf the jhanas are so good, and they\u2019ve been around for centuries, why haven\u2019t\nthey spread more widely? I kept asking myself this question as I drove back to\nthe airport.\n\nOne reason might be that jhanas have a natural half-life. Beacham had once\nmused to me that jhanas had a sort of anti-mimetic effect, where instead of\nevangelizing, practitioners tend to lose interest once they\u2019ve had their fill\nof pleasure. Cammarata \u2014 who says he rarely practices the jhanas anymore \u2014\ncompares this experience to drinking water while thirsty. While dehydrated,\nit\u2019s hard to think about anything but water. The first few gulps, when one\nfinds it, are ravenously satisfying. But once you\u2019ve drunk enough, your mind\nmoves on to other things. This had been my experience with J1.\n\nAnother possibility is that the jhanas have simply been hiding in plain sight.\nFor most of their existence, they were practiced only by monks under stringent\nconditions. Modern teachers made the jhanas more accessible, but they are\nstill cloaked in spiritual language and Buddhist tradition, which makes them\neasily dismissable as yet another wellness trend. Jhourney and the Qualia\nResearch Institute are taking a secular approach, but even their\ninterpretation of the jhanas is informed by Buddhism.\n\nThe fact that jhanas have persisted for this long undetected, however,\nshouldn\u2019t discredit their transformative power. Yoga and psychedelics, too,\nhad a \u201cWesternization\u201d moment that came centuries after people had begun using\nthem. Perhaps this is now that moment for the jhanas.\n\nThis last sentence will likely make many practitioners cringe. It\u2019s nice to\nhave well-kept secrets \u2014 it keeps the crowds away, deters misunderstanding and\nexploitation. But as a nonmeditator, my experience with the jhanas felt closer\nto behavioral therapy than a spiritual practice. (Jhanas are sometimes\ncompared to MDMA or psychedelics in terms of their therapeutic potential, with\nthe added benefit of being legal and freely available, and with fewer side\neffects.)\n\nI didn\u2019t need hundreds of hours of training to access a mental state that had\nan unmistakably positive impact on my affect; I just needed a new way of\nthinking about how to think. If panic attacks are real, and people can be\ncoached to not experience them, why is it so controversial to assert that\npeople can learn to induce the opposite of a panic attack? Furthermore, why\nisn\u2019t there a secular word for such a concept?\n\nThroughout the retreat, Zerfas repeated a maxim he\u2019d borrowed from other jhana\nteachers: One should take the effort they\u2019d expect to need and halve it, then\nhalve it again. This advice might apply not only to attaining the jhanas, but\nalso to grasping their impact. Jhanas are a technique for invoking altered\nstates of consciousness through sustained concentration, which can then relax\nour brains to perceive the world more clearly \u2014 it could really be that\nsimple. These claims should pique curiosity, rather than just skepticism.\n\nFor some reason, the notion of others being happy seems to trigger a \u201ctall\npoppy\u201d syndrome among the unhappy, as if there were only so much happiness to\ngo around. Even Zerfas, when he tried to explain his early experiences to\nfriends, found that they were \u201ceither skeptical or concerned,\u201d which made him\nnot want to talk about it. I, too, avoided telling my friends \u2014 whom I think\nof as quite open to unconventional ideas \u2014 what I was experiencing during the\nretreat, fearing they might think me crazy, or worse, painfully naive.\n\nPeer pressure can work in positive directions, but so too is there downward\npressure to not be happy, to not seek the insights, to continue mimicking the\npleasure-chasing activities so as not to disturb the (lack of) peace. Just as\nnot everyone eats well and exercises, despite knowing they ought to, not\neveryone wants to reflect on their life and risk destabilization, no matter\nhow straightforward the solution might be.\n\nJhanas are not a panacea; no behavioral intervention could ever be. Some\npeople might benefit more from cognitive behavioral therapy, psychiatric\ntreatment, or simply spending more time with loved ones than they would from\nthe jhanas. But jhanas surely deserve to reach more people than they are now.\n\nI entered first jhana in less time than it would\u2019ve taken for an MDMA pill to\nkick in. A popular YouTube video from meditation teacher Michael Taft, titled\n\u201cHow to Jhana,\u201d is just over 24 minutes long. \u201cDon't try too hard!\u201d Taft\ncounsels in the video\u2019s description. \u201cJhanas are meant to be enjoyable.\u201d My\nexperience might be atypical, but it\u2019s wise to remember that we\u2019ve barely\nscratched the surface in understanding the jhanas.\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about what makes jhanas easier or harder to experience\namong a general, nonmeditator population. Relying on advanced meditators to\nassess their difficulty seems premature. I personally found that the\nrelaxation techniques I\u2019d been taught to use in mindfulness meditation didn\u2019t\nhelp me with the jhanas, which required invoking what more closely resembled\nflow state \u2014 something I had a lot of practice with, thanks to the nature of\nmy daily work.\n\nJhanas, if they continue to spread, could bring a taste of happiness \u2014 or what\nKhema called \u201cbiting into the mango\u201d \u2014 to millions of people today who bury\ntheir bliss in addictive habits like doomscrolling, binge drinking, or\nnicotine. At this stage, it\u2019s just a hypothesis, but it seems like one worth\ntesting. Until we overcome our reflexive resistance to such an idea, however,\nwe will stand, like Tantalus, in a pool of water, with the power to quench our\nthirst just out of reach.\n\n  1.
