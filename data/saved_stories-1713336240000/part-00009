The\nrules mirror the ones imposed by the FCC during the Obama era and repealed\nduring Trump's presidency. But some advocates are criticizing a decision to\nlet Internet service providers speed up certain types of applications as long\nas application providers don't have to pay for special treatment.\n\nStanford Law Professor Barbara van Schewick, who has consistently argued for\nstricter net neutrality rules, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that \"harmful\n5G fast lanes are coming.\"\n\n\"T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon are all testing ways to create these 5G fast lanes\nfor apps such as video conferencing, games, and video where the ISP chooses\nand controls what gets boosted,\" van Schewick wrote. \"They use a technical\nfeature in 5G called network slicing, where part of their radio spectrum gets\nused as a special lane for the chosen app or apps, separated from the usual\nInternet traffic. The FCC\u2019s draft order opens the door to these fast lanes, so\nlong as the app provider isn\u2019t charged for them.\"\n\nIn an FCC filing yesterday, AT&T said that carriers will use network slicing\n\"to better meet the needs of particular business applications and consumer\npreferences than they could over a best-efforts network that generally treats\nall traffic the same.\"\n\n## Carriers could charge more for faster gaming\n\nVan Schewick warns that carriers could charge consumers more for plans that\nspeed up specific types of content. For example, a mobile operator could offer\na basic plan alongside more expensive tiers that boost certain online games or\na tier that boosts services like YouTube and TikTok.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEricsson, a telecommunications vendor that sells equipment to carriers\nincluding AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, has pushed for exactly this type of\nservice. In a report on how network slicing can be used commercially, Ericsson\nsaid that \"many gamers are willing to pay for enhanced gaming experiences\" and\nwould \"pay up to $10.99 more for a guaranteed gaming experience on top of\ntheir 5G monthly subscription.\"\n\nBefore the draft net neutrality order was released, van Schewick urged the FCC\nto \"clarify that its proposed no-throttling rule prohibits ISPs from speeding\nup and slowing down applications and classes of applications.\"\n\nIn a different filing last month, several advocacy groups similarly argued\nthat the \"no-throttling rule needs to ban selective speeding up, in addition\nto slowing down.\" That filing was submitted by the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Open Technology Institute at\nNew America, Public Knowledge, Fight for the Future, and United Church of\nChrist Media Justice Ministry.\n\nThe request for a ban on selective speeding was denied in paragraph 492 of\nRosenworcel's draft rules, which are scheduled for an April 25 vote. The draft\norder argues that the FCC's definition of \"throttling\" is expansive enough\nthat an explicit ban on what the agency called positive discrimination isn't\nneeded:\n\n> With the no-throttling rule, we ban conduct that is not outright blocking,\n> but inhibits the delivery of particular content, applications, or services,\n> or particular classes of content, applications, or services. Likewise, we\n> prohibit conduct that impairs or degrades lawful traffic to a non-harmful\n> device or class of devices. We interpret this prohibition to include, for\n> example, any conduct by a BIAS [Broadband Internet Access Service] provider\n> that impairs, degrades, slows down, or renders effectively unusable\n> particular content, services, applications, or devices, that is not\n> reasonable network management. Our interpretation of \"throttling\"\n> encompasses a wide variety of conduct that could impair or degrade an end\n> user's ability to access content of their choosing; thus, we decline\n> commenters' request to modify the rule to explicitly include positive and\n> negative discrimination of content.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n14\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
