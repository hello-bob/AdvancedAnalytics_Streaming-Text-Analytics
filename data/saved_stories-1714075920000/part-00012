Those neurons typically\nundergo energy-intensive molecular adaptations, occasionally resulting in\ntransient DNA damage^3,4,5. Here we found discrete clusters of excitatory\nhippocampal CA1 neurons with persistent double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks,\nnuclear envelope ruptures and perinuclear release of histone and dsDNA\nfragments hours after learning. Following these early events, some neurons\nacquired an inflammatory phenotype involving activation of TLR9 signalling and\naccumulation of centrosomal DNA damage repair complexes^6. Neuron-specific\nknockdown of Tlr9 impaired memory while blunting contextual fear conditioning-\ninduced changes of gene expression in specific clusters of excitatory CA1\nneurons. Notably, TLR9 had an essential role in centrosome function, including\nDNA damage repair, ciliogenesis and build-up of perineuronal nets. We\ndemonstrate a novel cascade of learning-induced molecular events in discrete\nneuronal clusters undergoing dsDNA damage and TLR9-mediated repair, resulting\nin their recruitment to memory circuits. With compromised TLR9 function, this\nfundamental memory mechanism becomes a gateway to genomic instability and\ncognitive impairments implicated in accelerated senescence, psychiatric\ndisorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Maintaining the integrity of TLR9\ninflammatory signalling thus emerges as a promising preventive strategy for\nneurocognitive deficits.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Control of neuronal excitation\u2013inhibition balance by BMP\u2013SMAD1 signalling\n\nArticle Open access 17 April 2024\n\n### A high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial atlas of cell types in the\nwhole mouse brain\n\nArticle Open access 13 December 2023\n\n### Integrated proteomics reveals autophagy landscape and an autophagy\nreceptor controlling PKA-RI complex homeostasis in neurons\n\nArticle Open access 10 April 2024\n\n## Main\n\nMemories of individuals\u2019 experiences are represented across assemblies of\nneurons in hippocampal and cortical circuits. Several mechanisms of formation\nand maintenance of these assemblies have been proposed. The most prominent\nsuch mechanism is stimulus-induced long-term potentiation of synaptic\nconnectivity^7, an energy-demanding process that involves extensive\nbiochemical and morphological adaptations at all levels of neuronal\nfunction^8,9. There is also evidence for contributions of pre-existing\ndevelopmental and other intrinsic programmes of individual neurons^10,\nincluding the baseline expression of the transcriptional factor CREB^11 and\nlineage of developmental origin^12,13. Recent focus has also been on the role\nof the interneuronal perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the stabilization of memory\ncircuits through tightened control of inhibitory inputs to dedicated neuronal\nassemblies^14. Here we explored whether an overarching process could integrate\nstimulus-dependent and pre-existing mechanisms that underlie the commitment of\nneurons to memory-specific assemblies.\n\n## CFC increases Tlr9 expression\n\nWe first performed an analysis of transcriptional profiles of dorso-\nhippocampal neurons beyond the initial, well-established 24\u221248 h time window\nwhen protein signalling, immediate early gene (IEG) expression and delayed\ngene expression (for example, growth factors) take place^15,16. To this end,\nwe performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of total RNA isolated from\nindividual mouse hippocampi obtained either 96 h or 21 days after contextual\nfear conditioning (CFC) (one-trial 3 min exposure to a context followed by a 2\ns, 0.7 mA shock, constant current), and noted a robust difference in the gene\nexpression profiles for recent relative to remote memory with little within-\ngroup variability (a total of 847, with 440 up-regulated) (Fig. 1a). We\npreviously reported that the 21-day gene expression repertoire revolved around\ncilium and extracellular matrix genes needed for PNN formation^17, but the 96\nh gene expression profiles associated with the shaping of recent memory\nrepresentations remained unexplored. We found that 96 h after CFC the majority\nof differentially expressed genes were immune response genes involved in\nnucleic acid sensing and cytokine release (71 up-regulated and 11 down-\nregulated) (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1). Within immune response genes,\nthe applied analyses identified TLR9 and its downstream NF-\u03baB signalling\npathway^18 as the most prominent functional gene clusters (Extended Data Fig.\n1a,b), which is consistent with the reported activation of the NLRP3\ninflammasome several days after CFC^19. We replicated the RNA-seq data with\nnew sets of individual hippocampal samples using quantitative PCR, confirming\nthe robustness of the observed effect (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). The up-\nregulation of Tlr9 gene expression was accompanied by increased TLR9 protein,\nas well as increased co-localization of TLR9 with LAMP2, a marker of late\nendosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 1b), an effect that was neuron-specific (Fig.\n1c). After CFC, TLR9 co-labelling with LAMP2 was significantly stronger\ncompared with markers of early (EEA1 and RAB7) and recycling (Rab11) endosomes\n(Fig. 1d), suggesting enhanced TLR9 trafficking to endosomes, enabling DNA\nrecognition and NF-\u03baB activation^20.\n\nFig. 1: Nucleic acid-sensing activity after CFC.\n\na, Bulk RNA-seq showed increased expression of 441 genes in hippocampi\nobtained 96 h after CFC (recent, n = 7 mice) compared with those collected 21\ndays (remote, n = 5 mice) after CFC. Volcano plots demonstrate significant\nincreases in expression of genes related to inflammation and TLR signalling. P\nadj, adjusted P value. b, TLR9 protein levels and co-localization of TLR9 with\nthe mature vesicle marker LAMP2 at different times after CFC. LAMP2 levels did\nnot fluctuate, TLR9 levels and its co-localization with LAMP2 increased 6 h\nafter CFC, peaking 96 h later (n = 6 mice, 360 neurons per time point; one-way\nANOVA; LAMP2: P = 0.3104, F_(3,19) = 1.278; TLR9: P = 0.0005, F_(3,20) =\n9.363; co-localization: P < 0.0001, F_(3,20) = 21.27). c, TLR9 and LAMP2\nsignals in glial cells (revealed by nuclear size), show no significant co-\nlocalization (n = 6 mice, 12 glial cells per time point; one-way ANOVA; P =\n0.8186, F_(3,20) = 0.3090).

Note the lack of\nTLR9 and LAMP2 signals in a glial cell (cyan arrow).

In the absence of infection or apoptotic DNA\ndamage, these pathways are typically silent, but under neuronal stress, TLR9\nresponds to the release of mitochondrial DNA fragments^21. To determine\nwhether extranuclear dsDNA fragments with TLR9-activating potential can be\nfound in hippocampal neurons, we collected hippocampi of naive mice or mice\ntrained in CFC 24 or 96 h earlier and isolated their extranuclear DNA. After\nconfirming that the fraction was not contaminated with genomic DNA, we\nproceeded with cloning and sequencing of the isolated dsDNA fragments (Fig.\n1e). Contrary to our expectation that, if any, we would identify mitochondrial\ndsDNA, all cloned dsDNA fragments were of genomic origin, predominantly\nstemming from non-coding DNA. We cloned a total of 53 dsDNA fragments\nbelonging to 25 unique genomic sequences, none of which corresponded to\nmitochondrial genes. After CFC, the frequency of CG-containing sequences,\nwhich are putative activators of TLR9, transiently increased from 33% to 77%.\nWe also performed live-cell imaging of primary hippocampal neuronal cultures\nusing dyes that detect dsDNA or mitochondrial DNA to distinguish non-\nmitochondrial from mitochondrial extranuclear DNA. Non-mitochondrial mobile\nDNA signals were readily detected in the cytosol (Fig. 1f and Supplementary\nVideo 1).\n\n## CFC triggers dsDNA breaks and DDR\n\nNeuronal activity is known to induce transient DNA breaks^3, which are\nrequired for the learning-related induction of IEGs. However, such breaks\noccur in enhancers of coding genes and are repaired within minutes without\naffecting neuronal homeostasis^5. To examine the origin of extranuclear dsDNA\nfragments generated by CFC, we hypothesized that, in discrete neuronal\npopulations, activity-induced DNA damage might be more substantial and\nsustained. We performed a time-course study up to 96 h after CFC, focusing on\ndsDNA breaks in individual cells of the hippocampal CA1 region because of its\nwell-established role in the formation and retention of context memories^22.\nTo detect DNA damage, we performed immunofluorescent labelling with antibodies\nspecific for the dsDNA break-binding phospho-histone \u03b3H2AX^3 and quantified\nthe signals using plot profile or particle analyses. To minimize the\ninterference of background \u03b3H2AX activity unrelated to dsDNA breaks, foci were\nselected if their fluorescence intensity was at least two standard deviations\ngreater than the average intensity of the total nuclear signal for each CA1\nregion of interest. One and three hours after CFC, we identified discrete,\npatchy clusters of CA1 nuclei exhibiting a significant increase of the total\nnumber of neurons with clear \u03b3H2AX foci (Fig. 2a, left and Supplementary Video\n2). Whereas the number of nuclear foci subsequently decreased, much larger\n\u03b3H2AX-labelled foci emerged in individual neurons, persisting from 6 to 96 h\n(Fig. 2a, middle). All \u03b3H2AX signals were neuron-specific and were not found\nin astrocytes or microglia (Fig. 2a, right). Co-labelling with the nuclear\nenvelope protein lamin B1 revealed that at the time of maximal dsDNA break\ndetection, a subset of nuclei exhibited envelope ruptures (discontinuation of\nlamin B1 labelling), resulting in perinuclear release of \u03b3H2AX in RNA-rich\nareas typical of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig.\n2a), a primary localization site of inactive TLR9. The number of ruptures\nincreased significantly 1 h after CFC and remained detectable in a smaller\nnumber of nuclei throughout the 96 h period. The perinuclear \u03b3H2AX signals co-\nlabelled with TLR9 (Fig. 2c) and to a lesser extent with the DNA dye Hoechst\nand with antibodies recognizing dsDNA (Extended Data Fig. 2b). These findings\nindicated that in some neurons, \u03b3H2AX and dsDNA, alone or in complexes, were\nreleased from the nucleus in TLR9-containing perinuclear sites. The persistent\n\u03b3H2AX signals found at later time points (6\u201396 h) had a diameter of 4 \u03bcm or\nlarger, and co-localized with the centrosome markers centrin and \u03b3-tubulin,\ndemonstrating pericentrosomal localization rather than localization at sites\nof dsDNA breaks (Fig. 2d, left), as suggested previously^4. Contrary to the\nsmall, sharp and focused nuclear signals, all pericentrosomal signals were\nlarge and fuzzy. These signals were strongly and consistently co-labelled with\n53BP1, the main mediator of DNA repair by nonhomologous end joining^23,24\n(Fig. 2d, right). Neurons undergoing dsDNA breaks and DNA damage repair (DDR)\ndid not show any nuclear morphological indices of apoptosis. Both nuclear and\npericentrosomal \u03b3H2AX signals overlapped with cleaved caspase-3 foci, but the\npatterns of their localization were consistent with the non-apoptotic,\nprobably memory-related roles of cleaved caspase-3^25 (data not shown).\nAlthough consistent with evidence of centrosomal localization of 53BP1^26 and\nwith increasing recognition of centrosomal control of DDR^27, the extent to\nwhich dsDNA breaks and centrosomes shared molecular components, including\n\u03b3H2AX, dsDNA fragments and DNA repair enzymes was unexpected and suggested\nthat the proposed role of centrosomes in the maintenance of gene integrity in\ndividing cells^28 also applies to adult neurons undergoing memory-related\nactivity.\n\nFig. 2: DNA damage and DDR after CFC.\n\na, Left, number of neurons showing \u03b3H2AX puncta (n = 360 neurons per group;\none-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001, F_(5,30) = 65.09) and size of \u03b3H2AX foci (n = 360\nneurons per group; one-way ANOVA; P < 0.0001, F_(5,30) = 38.17) after CFC.\nRight, localization of \u03b3H2AX (green arrows) in neurons (marked by NeuN; cyan\narrows) relative to astrocytes (marked by GFAP; purple arrows) and microglia\n(marked by IBA1; orange arrows) (two-way ANOVA; factor: cell type, P < 0.0001,\nF_(2,90) = 673.8; factor: time, P < 0.0001, F_(5,90) = 77.73; cell type \u00d7\ntime, P < 0.0001, F_(10,90) = 77.95).

We collected brain sections 1 h after CFC\nbecause this time point is optimal for the detection of Fos in CA1^29, as well\nas EGR1, which shows both sizeable baseline expression as well as up-\nregulation after learning^30. We also performed immunostaining for CREB, whose\nbaseline expression has been directly implicated in memory^11. Many neurons\nwith the typical, homogenous nuclear labelling for Fos, CREB and EGR1 were\ndevoid of \u03b3H2AX signals and showed overall insignificant correlation (Fig. 2e\nand Extended Data Fig. 3). Even in instances of co-detection, IEG labelling in\nneurons positive for \u03b3H2AX was mainly punctate and scattered. Only 20% of all\n\u03b3H2AX-positive nuclei were Fos-positive (52% of Fos^+ nuclei were co-labelled\nwith \u03b3H2AX). Instead, \u03b3H2AX signals were associated with inflammatory\nsignalling, as shown by a high degree of co-localization with RELA, the most\nabundant NF-\u03baB family member, which translocates to the nucleus upon\nactivation (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nWe also examined to what extent IEG or DDR (centrosomal \u03b3H2AX\nsignals)-responsive neurons up-regulate Fos during subsequent memory\nreactivation (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Because IEG responses peak\n1 h after CFC and DDR peaks at 96 h, we permanently labelled the CFC-activated\nIEG population with GFP using the robust activity marker PRAM\u2013GFP driven by\nthe Fos promoter^31. In this way we could examine Fos reactivation 96 h after\nCFC in both populations by comparing the overlap of \u03b3H2AX, GFP and Fos. As\n\u03b3H2AX^+Fos^+ neurons were scarce, we compared 30\u201334 neurons per population.\nRelative to PRAM-labelled neurons, \u03b3H2AX^+ (DDR population) neurons showed\nsignificantly smaller Fos responses after memory reactivation, demonstrating\nthat both after CFC and after memory reactivation, IEG and inflammatory\nsignalling occurred predominantly in non-overlapping neuronal populations.\n\n## Tlr9 in CA1 neurons is required for context memory\n\nWe next investigated whether the inflammatory response is a side effect of\nlearning-induced DNA damage or whether it contributes to memory formation. We\ninduced a neuron-specific knockout of TLR9 in CA1 dorso-hippocampal neurons of\nTlr9^fl/fl mice by locally injecting adeno-associated virus (AAV9) expressing\nCre recombinase\u2013GFP or GFP under control of the human synapsin promoter (Syn)\n(Fig. 3a, left). The Syn-cre-injected mice showed impaired context memory, as\nrevealed by significant reduction of freezing behaviour over multiple tests\n(Fig. 3a, middle). The neuron-specific virus expression was shown by\ndifferential staining for astrocytes and microglia (Fig. 3a, right and\nExtended Data Fig. 4a). Knockdown was validated by quantitative analysis of\nTLR9 and RELA (Fig. 3b). The memory deficit was replicated by a different\napproach, using injection of AAV9 expressing Syn-driven Tlr9-targeting short\nhairpin RNA (shRNA) in the hippocampi of wild-type mice (Fig. 3c). The\nhippocampal Tlr9 knockdown (Tlr9-KO) also impaired trace fear conditioning\n(TFC), as shown by reduced freezing during context and tone tests, but did not\naffect delay fear conditioning (DFC), a form of hippocampus-independent\nlearning (Fig. 3d). Because viral injections are known to cause inflammatory\nresponses of astrocytes and microglia (as confirmed in our post-mortem\nanalysis; Extended Data Fig. 4b), we also determined the contribution of these\ncell populations to the observed memory deficits. Astrocytic knockdown using\nGFAP-cre did not affect CFC after injection in Tlr9^fl/fl mice (Extended Data\nFig. 4c). Consistent with previous findings^32, microglial depletion was\nsimilarly ineffective, as determined in both wild-type and Tlr9^fl/fl mice\nreceiving a CSF1R inhibitor in their diet or regular diet after injection of\nSyn-cre (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). Introduction of Syn-cre in the hippocampi\nof WT mice did not affect CFC relative to Syn-GFP-injected wild-type controls\n(Extended Data Fig. 4e, bottom right).\n\nFig. 3: Impaired context memory after neuron-specific deletion of hippocampal\nTlr9.\n\na, Left, experimental schematic.

The TLR9\nantagonist oligonucleotide ODN2088 significantly impaired CFC, whereas the\nsmall drug cGAS\u2013STING inhibitors RU-521 and H-151 were ineffective relative to\nvehicle (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Consistent with these observations, CFC was\nintact in mice lacking the Sting1 gene relative to wild-type controls\n(Extended Data Fig. 5b). Finally, to test the role of endogenous processing of\nextranuclear dsDNA in memory formation, we also manipulated the levels of two\nDNases controlling cellular DNA sensing. DNase2 digests dsDNA in shorter dsDNA\nfragments required for TLR9 binding and activation^33. To prevent the\ngeneration of TLR9-activating DNA fragments we virally overexpressed Dnase2\nshRNA or scrambled shRNA in mouse dorsal hippocampi. Dnase2 shRNA treatment\nsignificantly impaired memory formation (Extended Data Fig. 5c). TREX1 is a\ncytosolic DNase that predominantly restricts the activity of the cGAS\u2013STING\npathway^33. We disrupted cGAS\u2013STING-mediated DNA sensing by overexpressing\nTREX1\u2013GFP in the dorsal hippocampus, using GFP overexpression as a control. In\nthese mice, context memory formation was not affected (Extended Data Fig. 5d).\nIn sum, these experiments provided converging evidence for a role of neuron-\nspecific TLR9-mediated but not cGAS\u2013STING-mediated dsDNA sensing in the\nformation and persistence of context memories.\n\n## Tlr9 knockdown disrupts CFC-induced gene expression\n\nTo better characterize the effects of CFC and neuron-specific Tlr9-KO on gene\nexpression in individual neuronal and non-neuronal hippocampal populations, we\nperformed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq). For this experiment, we\nexpressed the viral vectors in the entire dorsal hippocampus to analyse their\neffects across all subfields. We collected nuclei and prepared libraries (Lib)\nfrom 4 groups of mice (pooled from 5 mice per group): Tlr9^fl/fl mice injected\nwith Syn-GFP and euthanized 96 h after CFC (Lib 1); Tlr9^fl/fl mice injected\nwith Syn-cre and euthanized 96 h after CFC (Lib 2); naive Tlr9^f^l/fl mice\ninjected with Syn-GFP (Lib 3); and naive Tlr9^fl/fl mice injected with Syn-cre\n(Lib 4). Lib 4 was sorted to obtain GFP-positive and GFP-negative nuclei and\nused to determine the cell specificity of cre expression by snRNA-seq\n(Extended Data Fig. 6a), whereas the other samples were analysed for CFC-\ninduced (Lib 1 versus Lib 3) and Tlr9-KO (Lib 2 versus Lib 1) effects (Fig.\n4). An unsupervised algorithm identified 29 clusters, with the highest\ndiversity seen among excitatory CA1 neurons (12 clusters) relative to dentate\ngyrus granule cells (DGGC) (4 clusters), interneurons (4 clusters) and non-\nneuronal cells (typically 1 cluster each) (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Analyses of\nrobust gene expression changes (more than 1.5-fold) revealed both increases\nand decreases of gene expression in the CFC and Tlr9-KO groups (Fig. 4a and\nSupplementary Tables 1 and 2). Tlr9-KO abolished the CFC-induced gene\nexpression but did not affect the expression of these genes relative to the\nnaive control (Lib 2 versus Lib 3; Supplementary Table 3). An exception was\ncluster 26, which showed a paradoxical up-regulation of genes involved in axon\nguidance and adhesion in Tlr9-KO (Extended Data Fig. 7). CFC induced a set of\nhighly conserved genes across neuronal clusters and occasionally in non-\nneuronal cells, with most genes associated with the endomembrane system and\nacting as endoplasmic reticulum chaperones and regulators of vesicle\ntrafficking and function, and with interleukin-6 production (Fig. 4b and\nSupplementary Tables 4 and 5). Some of the proteins encoded by these genes\nmediate TLR9 folding (HSP90B1) and induce vesicle acidification (ATP6V0C),\nwhich are critical for TLR9 activation (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6c),\nwhereas others, such as those associated with interleukin-6 signalling,\nrequire TLR9 activation. In line with recent reports, we detected many\ndoublecortin-positive (DCX^+) neurons among CA1 neurons, DGGC and\ninterneurons^34 (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8), and found that the\nconserved gene responses were more pronounced in the DCX^+ cluster (Fig. 4e).\nThe expression of Dcx in CA1 and up-regulation of Hsp90b1 after CFC were also\nconfirmed by RNAscope analysis (Extended Data Fig. 9). A reactome analysis of\nbroader gene expression profiles (including all genes showing a significant\nincrease in expression (P < 0.05) in addition to those showing conserved\nchanges) revealed CFC-induced gene expression across pathways involved in RNA\nand protein metabolism, vesicle trafficking, immunity, cell cycle, DNA repair\nand cilium assembly, however in this case, DCX^\u2212 excitatory CA1 and DGGC\nneurons were the most affected population (Fig. 4f). Although we did not\ndetect low abundance transcripts of immune mediators (such as TLR9 or RELA),\nthe findings confirmed that 96 h after CFC, neurons acquire inflammatory\nphenotypes associated with TLR signalling, DNA repair, ciliogenesis and\nvesicle trafficking. In addition to the described effects, CFC and Tlr9-KO\ninduced some unexpected phenotypic changes of excitatory neurons, such as\nfluctuations of vGlut2 and DCX (Extended Data Fig. 8).\n\nFig. 4: Single-cell changes of gene expression after neuron-specific deletion\nof hippocampal Tlr9.\n\na, Tlr9^fl/fl mice injected with Syn-cre or Syn-GFP were trained in CFC or\nleft untrained (naive), and 96 h later, dorsal hippocampal nuclei were\nisolated and processed for snRNA-seq. Robust (more than 1.5-fold) changes of\ngene expression were found after CFC in mice injected with control virus (Syn-\nGFP CFC versus Syn-GFP naive) or Cre virus (Syn-cre CFC versus Syn-GFP CFC).\nb, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis reveals that most genes regulated by CFC and\nTlr9-KO involve endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondrial function, IL-6\nproduction and inflammation. CFC induced up-regulation of these genes, whereas\nTlr9-KO blocked this effect. c, The most conserved genes up-regulated by CFC\nand down-regulated by Tlr9-KO across cell clusters include Atp6v0c and\nHsp90b1, key regulators of TLR9 function (Extended Data Fig. 6). d, Dcx\nexpression superimposed on uniform manifold approximation and projection\n(UMAP) analysis of snRNA-seq data from dorsal hippocampal cells.

Circles are scaled to the percentage effect of\nTlr9-KO on the gene expression or pathway relative to Syn-GFP with CFC. TLR\ncascades, DDR and cilium assembly are enriched among the pathways that are\nmost up-regulated by CFC and down-regulated by Tlr9-KO. RNA Pol II, RNA\npolymerase II.\n\nSource Data\n\nFull size image\n\nGiven that immune cells express high levels of TLR9 and are also a source of\ncirculating, cell-free DNA^35, we also examined whether bloodborne\ninfiltrating cells and DNA from extracellular sources might contribute to the\nobserved up-regulation of TLR9 signalling and memory. Such contribution was\nunlikely, however, given the absence of lymphocytic and myeloid cell markers\nin our samples (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Similarly, systemic or\nintrahippocampal infusions of DNase1 (which efficiently degrades cell-free\nDNA) before and shortly after CFC were ineffective (Extended Data Fig. 10b),\nas was intrahippocampal injection of DNase1 and S1 nuclease, which degrades\nsingle-stranded DNA, before the context test.\n\nIn summary, the snRNA-seq approach identified ongoing CFC-induced cell-\nspecific (mainly neuron-specific) gene expression responses and discrete\nphenotypic changes 96 h after CFC. Tlr9-KO blunted the induction of most of\nthe up-regulated genes without affecting CFC down-regulated genes and induced\nadditional, CFC-unrelated changes, especially in excitatory cluster 26.\n\n## TLR9 controls DDR, ciliogenesis and PNN build-up\n\nTo determine the cellular consequences of Tlr9-KO, we collected the hippocampi\nof WT and Tlr9^fl/fl mice 24 h after their last memory test following each\nexperiment, and first examined DNA damage and DDR response. In addition, we\ncollected hippocampi of Rela^fl/fl and interferon receptor 1-floxed\n(Ifnar1^fl/fl) mice undergoing the same genetic and behavioural manipulations\nto examine the potential contributions of these pathways downstream of TLR9. A\ncontrol group that was not exposed to CFC was also included. We found a\nsignificant increase of the number of neurons with dsDNA breaks in all mice,\nincluding wild-type mice, injected with Syn-cre. However, this effect was more\npronounced in the genetically modified lines (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig.\n11) and was also found in mice that were not exposed to CFC. There were large\nmultifocal nuclear accumulations of \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 in wild-type and\nIfnar1^fl/fl mice injected with Syn-cre, as previously found in nuclear bodies\nformed around DNA lesions in cell lines undergoing replication stress^28, with\nan average size of 2 \u03bcm corresponding to nuclear stress bodies^36. Notably, in\nTlr9^fl/fl and Rela^fl/fl mice, Syn-cre completely disrupted the recruitment\nof 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage and to centrosomal DDR sites (Fig. 5a,b). To\nexamine whether this affected other memory-related centrosomal functions, we\nalso examined the consequences of individual gene knockdown on ciliogenesis\nand cilium-dependent PNN formation^17. Whereas wild-type and IFNAR1^fl/fl mice\ninjected with Syn-Cre showed intact ciliogenesis in CA1 neurons, as shown by\nfilamentous staining for adenyl cyclase III (ACIII), neurons of Tlr9^fl/fl and\nRela^fl/fl mice showed punctate and disorganized ACIII labelling accompanied\nby disappearance of PNNs, with the scarce remaining PNNs showing markedly\nreduced complexity (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 12). These findings\ndemonstrated that lack of TLR9 disrupts the nuclear and centrosomal DDR\nmachinery so that at the time of CFC, CA1 neurons could not recruit DDR\ncomplexes or form cilia and PNNs. Whereas both Rela-KO and Ifnar1-KO could\ncontribute to Tlr9-KO-induced genomic instability, the effects on 53BP1,\nciliogenesis and PNN formation were most likely to be mediated by the RELA\ndownstream pathway.\n\nFig. 5: Impaired DDR, ciliogenesis and PNN formation by neuron-specific\ndeletion of hippocampal Tlr9.\n\na, Increased number of neurons showing \u03b3H2AX signals in mice hippocampally\ninjected with Syn-cre relative to Syn-GFP (n = 5 mice (150 neurons) per group;\ntwo-tailed Chi-square test; \\\\({\\chi }_{(4)}^{2}=54.86\\\\), P < 0.0001; post\nhoc analysis using Bonferroni correction, \u03b1 = 0.05; versus GFP: WT cre ****P <\n0.0001, Tlr9^fl/fl ****P < 0.0001, Rela^fl/fl ****P < 0.0001 and Ifnar1^fl/fl\n****P < 0.0001).

The observed genomic instability was accompanied\nby centrosomal DDR in wild-type and Ifnar1^fl/fl mice, but blunted in\nTlr9^fl/fl and Rela^fl/fl mice injected with Syn-cre (n = 5 mice (150 neurons)\nper group; two-tailed Chi-square test; \\\\({\\chi }_{(4)}^{2}=124.1\\\\), P <\n0.0001; post hoc analysis using Bonferroni correction \u03b1 = 0.05; versus WT cre:\nTlr9^fl/fl ^####P < 0.0001, Rela^fl/fl ^####P < 0.0001 and Ifnar1^fl/fl ^NSP =\n0.9681).

On the basis of the evidence presented here, we suggest that\nin distinct populations of hippocampal CA1 excitatory neurons, this is\nachieved through learning-induced TLR9 signalling linking DNA damage to DDR.\nOver several days, such neurons acquired an inflammatory phenotype involving\nactivation of the TLR9 DNA-sensing pathway and pericentrosomal accumulation of\nDDR complexes. TLR9 activation was most probably triggered by the release of\n\u03b3H2AX and dsDNA fragments, stemming predominantly from non-coding DNA, into\nthe endomembrane system. Some of these neurons underwent more profound\nphenotypic fluctuations consistent with changes of their differentiation\nstate. The identified genetic, molecular and cellular phenotypes were blocked\nby neuron-specific knockdown of Tlr9, and some, including disruption of\npericentrosomal DDR and ciliogenesis, were replicated by Rela knockdown but\nnot by Ifnar1 knockdown, identifying NF-\u03baB rather than interferon pathways as\ndownstream mediators. The involvement of DNA sensing by TLR9, but not the\nevolutionary older cGAS\u2013STING pathway in CFC, suggests that neurons have\nadopted an immune-based memory mechanism involving trafficking of dsDNA and\nhistone to endolysosomes, rather than their release in the cytosol^37. This is\nconsistent with the gene expression profiles observed 96 h after CFC, which\nwere primarily related to endoplasmic reticulum function and vesicle\ntrafficking.\n\nAlthough we could not directly demonstrate activation of TLR9 by specific DNA\nfragments at the single-neuron level, we found evidence that several\nTLR9-activating mechanisms are induced by CFC. TLR9 signalling is induced\nmainly by unmethylated CpG DNA sequences, which are predominantly of bacterial\norigin^38, but such sequences can also be generated through demethylation of\nmammalian DNA during learning and long-term potentiation^15. Moreover, there\nis increasing evidence of TLR9 activation by mammalian self-DNA^39,40 and by\nhistones^41, both of which we found to be released from the nucleus following\nnuclear envelope ruptures.\n\nGiven the association of dsDNA damage with neurodegeneration^42, neurons\nundergoing learning-induced dsDNA breaks might be expected to be excluded from\nmemory assemblies. This was also suggested by lack of significant association\nbetween the observed inflammatory responses with other mechanisms implicated\nin learning, including IEG responses. However, we found that these neurons\nwere required for memory formation, but only if their TLR9-mediated DDR\nmachinery was intact. Although many factors could predispose individual\nneurons to respond with dsDNA damage rather than IEG, it needs to be\nconsidered that diverse responses to synaptic input^43 could be based on the\ngenetic diversity of neurons generated throughout life^44. The occurrence of\nsustained dsDNA breaks might reflect a particularly intense CA1 response of\ndiscrete CA1 neurons best tuned to the context information carried by\nexcitatory input^5, and resulting in their lasting representation of that\ncontext. A shared history of cycles of DNA damage and repair could similarly\norganize neuronal assemblies by collective experience as a shared history of\nIEG response or birthdate, providing yet another dimension to memory\norganization. An advantage of recruiting distinct neuronal populations to\nmemory representations is that they can uniquely contribute to their\nstability, specificity, flexibility and other properties^31,45. Whereas\npopulations displaying IEG responses during memory formation and reactivation\nmight be better suited for retrieval-mediated memory updates and\nmodifications^46, the population displaying an inflammatory DDR phenotype\nseems better suited to maintain stable representations of context memories. By\ncoordinating centrosome-mediated DDR, TLR9 could integrate genomic responses\nto synaptic inputs (dsDNA breaks), which subserve memory specificity, with\ndelayed, extrasynaptic memory mechanisms (ciliogenesis and PNN formation),\nwhich promote memory persistence^14,17,40, at least when memories are\nhippocampally dependent^47.\n\nOur findings support recent data revealing more widespread expression of DCX\nin hippocampal and cortical neurons than originally believed^34,48.\nFluctuations of DCX in response to hyperexcitation and inflammation are\nthought to reflect changes in neuronal maturation states^49. We found similar\nchanges within small, DCX^+ CA1 clusters (clusters 11, 21 and 24) that lost\ntheir DCX^+ phenotype in response to CFC, indicating that some neurons, at\nleast transiently, shifted to a more mature state. Given the essential role of\nDCX in nucleus-centrosome coupling^50, it is conceivable that DCX could also\ncontribute to the recruitment of centrosomal DDR complexes in some of the\nidentified neurons.\n\nIn addition to its relevance for memory, TLR9 activity was essential for the\nmaintenance of neuronal genomic integrity. Knockdown of TLR9 inflammatory\nsignalling showed that even mild stimuli, such as spontaneous or memory-\nrelated neuronal activity (and possibly other endogenous factors such as\ncommensal microbes^51) can trigger substantial genomic instability in the\nabsence of TLR9-controlled DNA sensing and DDR. This suggests that the\nconsequences of TLR9-based anti-inflammatory treatment strategies^52, although\nbeneficial for restricting astrocytic and microglial activation, may prove\ndetrimental for neuronal health if they compromise the functioning of the\nneuronal TLR9 pathway. Given that genomic instability is considered to be a\ngateway to accelerated senescence and psychiatric and neurodegenerative\ndisorders^42,53,54, neuron-specific TLR9 and downstream RELA signalling are\nlikely to emerge as promising preventive and therapeutic targets for\npreserving neurocognitive health.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Animal husbandry\n\nEight-week-old male and female C57BL/6 N mice were obtained from Envigo.\nTlr9^fl/fl (C57BL/6J-Tlr9^em1Ldm/J) mice with loxP sites flanking exon 1 of\nthe Tlr9, Ifnar1^fl/fl (B6(Cg)-Ifnar1^tm1.1Ees/J) mice with loxP sites\nflanking exon 3 of the type-1 interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor gene, Rela^fl/fl\n(B6.129S1-Rela^tm1Ukl/J) mice with loxP sites flanking exon 1 of the Rela\ngene, and Sting1-knockout mice C57BL/6J-Sting1gt/J; Goldenticket (Tmem173gt)\nmice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and bred in institutional\nfacilities. All mice were eight weeks of age at the beginning of experiments,\nunless otherwise specified. All mice were group housed (12 h:12 h light:dark\ncycle with lights on at 07:00, temperature 20\u201322 \u00b0C, humidity 30\u201360%) with ad\nlibitum access to food and water (mice were switched to single housing one\nweek before experiments). All experimental groups were mixed sex, consisting\nof approximately equal numbers of males and females. All procedures were\napproved by Northwestern University\u2019s Animal Care and Use Committee (protocols\nIS00002463 and IS00003359) and Albert Einstein\u2019s Animal Care and Use Committee\n(protocols 00001289 and 00001268) in compliance with US National Institutes of\nHealth standards, and at Aarhus University in compliance with the Danish\nNational Animal Experiment Committee (protocol 2021-15-0201-00801).\n\n### Tissue collection\n\nFor all analyses, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, dorsal\nhippocampi immediately dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue\nwas stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until protein or RNA extractions were performed.\n\n### Bulk RNA-seq\n\nRead quality was assessed using FastQC^46 (v0.10.1) to identify sequencing\ncycles with low average quality, adapter contamination, or repetitive\nsequences from PCR amplification. Alignment quality was analysed using\nSAMtools flagstat with default parameters. Data quality was visually inspected\nas described previously^55. Furthermore, we assessed whether samples were\nsequenced deep enough by analysing the average per base coverage and the\nsaturation correlation for all samples using the MEDIPS R package^56. The\nsaturation function splits each library in fractions of the initial number of\nreads (ten subsets of equal size) and plots the convergence. The correlation\nbetween biological replicates was evaluated using Pearson correlation\n(function MEDIPS.correlation). Only data passing all quality standards were\nused for further analyses. Data were aligned to the genome using gapped\nalignment as RNA transcripts are subject to splicing and reads might therefore\nspan two distant exons. Reads were aligned to the whole Mus musculus mm10\ngenome using STAR aligner58 (2.3.0e_r291) with default options, generating\nmapping files (BAM format). Reads were aligned to mouse genome M. musculus\nmm10 and counted using FeaturesCount as described previously^55. Genes with\nsignificantly different fold change (false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05)\nwere classified as up-regulated or down-regulated.\n\n### Isolation of nuclei and FACS\n\nFresh dorsal hippocampal tissue was collected from mice 96 h after CFC. Nuclei\nwere isolated following an established protocol^57. RNase inhibitor was added\nto the 6\u00d7 homogenization buffer stable master mix at a final concentration of\n1.2 U \u03bcl^\u22121. Tissue was homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer for 1.5 min.\nSamples were resuspended with the 50% iodixanol solution (50% iodixanol in 1\u00d7\nhomogenization buffer) via gentle pipetting to make a final concentration of\n25% iodixanol. Three millilitres of a 35% iodixanol solution (35% iodixanol in\n1\u00d7 homogenization containing 480 mM sucrose) was added to a new 15 ml Falcon\ntube. Three millilitres of a 29% iodixanol solution (29% iodixanol in 1\u00d7\nhomogenization buffer containing 480 mM sucrose) was layered above the 35%\niodixanol mixture. A 4 ml 25% iodixanol solution was layered on the 29%\nsolution. In a swinging-bucket centrifuge, nuclei were centrifuged for 20 min\nat 3,000g. After centrifugation, the nuclei were present at the interface of\nthe 29% and 35% iodixanol solutions. This band with the nuclei was collected\nin a 300 \u03bcl volume and transferred to a pre-chilled tube. Following isolation,\nnuclei were counted and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting\n(FACS) buffer (1% BSA, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 U \u03bcl^\u22121 RNase inhibitor in PBS) at 2\n\u00d7 10^6 nuclei per ml. A subset of nuclei was sorted by GFP expression on a\nhigh-speed cell sorter flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter MoFlowXDP cell sorter).\nSee Supplementary Fig. 1 for the detailed gating strategy.\n\n### snRNA-seq\n\nsnRNA-seq libraries were generated from up to 10,000 individual cells captured\nin an oil emulsion on a Chromium Controller (10x Genomics). cDNA was generated\nin the individual cell\u2013gel bead emulsion micro-reactors while adding barcodes\nat the cellular and molecular level using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3\u2032\nKit v3.1(10x Genomics kit 1000268). The barcoded cDNAs from the individual\ncells were combined for the remaining library process. The unique molecular\nbarcodes (UMIs) prevented amplification artefacts from skewing the analysis.\nThe libraries were analysed on a Fragment Analyzer 5200 (Agilent Technologies)\nto ensure a normal size distribution with an average size of 450 bp and\nsequenced on an llumina Sequencer with the following read lengths: 28 bp for\nread 1, 10 bp for i7 index, 10 bp for i5 index and 90 bp for read 2 at a read\ndepth of 20,000 reads per cell. Five libraries were generated and analysed\n(Supplementary Table 6).\n\n### snRNA-seq analysis\n\nThe sequencing files in FASTQ format of each sample were aligned against mouse\nmm10 genome v4.0.0 and converted to gene count matrices using Cellranger\nsoftware v7.0.1. Quality control and downstream analysis was performed using\nSeurat R package v4.3.0. Doublets were detected and removed using R package\nscDblFinder v1.13.13. Ambient RNA was detected and corrected using R package\nSoupX v1.6.2. Cells with less than 1000 detected genes, more than 4,000\ndetected genes, or more than 5% mitochondrial genes were excluded from further\nanalysis. Samples were normalized using Seurat SCTransform function and then\nintegrated and clustered using Seurat functions. Differential gene expression\nanalysis was performed to compare cells from different samples in each\ncluster. Genes with more than 1.5-fold change and an adjusted P value of less\nthan 0.01 were defined as significant. Co-expression of two genes was assessed\nby comparing the cosine similarity of the target two genes and random chosen\npair of genes. Gene set enrichment analysis was run on each cluster comparing\nsamples with different condition against the Gene Ontology database using R\npackage fgsea v1.20.0. Pathways with less than 0.05 adjusted P value are\nconsidered significantly enriched. The pathway analysis was performed using\nthe Reactome Patway database (version 86)^58. Well-established markers for\nbrain and blood-derived cell populations were used to define individual\nclusters^59,60.\n\n### Gene ontology and interaction network analyses of bulk RNA-seq data\n\nFunctional protein association network analysis was performed using Search\nTool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database\n(version 11.0)^61 for up-regulated genes. The network was processed applying\nkmeans clustering, setting cluster number to 4. Inflammatory response-\nassociated genes were identified using Mouse Genome Database (MGI) Batch Query\nGenome Analysis Tool (v6.23). Selection criteria was classification within the\nGO term \u2018Inflammatory response\u2019 (ID: GO:0006954) using IMP (Inferred from\nmutant phenotype), IEA (Inferred from electronic annotation) and IBA (Inferred\nfrom biological aspect of ancestor) evidence codes. Functional classification\nof up-regulated genes was performed using PANTHER Classification System\nengine, version 17.0. Genes were analysed through PANTHER Overrepresentation\n(test type: Fisher; correction: FDR; functional classification: PANTHER GO-\nSlim Biological Process, Mus musculus - REFLIST (21997)).\n\n### RT^2 array\n\nDifferential expression of inflammatory response-associated genes between\nrecent and remote memory was analysed using The Mouse Innate and Adaptive\nImmune Responses RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen, 330231 PAMM-052ZA), according\nto manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total RNA was extracted from dorsal hippocampi\nusing PureLink RNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher, 12183018 A). Tissue was dissected\neither 96 h (n = 5, pooled) or 21 days (n = 5, pooled) after CFC, resuspended\nin lysis buffer, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. RNA was\nextracted following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was synthetized using\nthe RT^2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen, 330401). For each experimental group, 500\n\u03bcg of total RNA was used for the cDNA synthesis. Genomic DNA elimination\nreaction was prepared by mixing RNA with 2 \u03bcl of buffer GE in 10 \u03bcl total\nreaction volume. Real-time PCR reaction was performed using RT^2 SYBR Green\nqPCR Mastermix in duplicates for each sample (recent, remote). The PCR\nreaction was performed in an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System with\nthe following cycling conditions: 95 \u00b0C, 10 min; then 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C, 15\ns; 60 \u00b0C, 1 min. \u0394C_t values for each gene were calculated by subtracting the\naverage C_t value of 6 housekeeping genes from the C_t value of each target\ngene. Differential expression between recent and remote memory was calculated\nfrom \u0394\u0394C_t value.\n\n### Quantitative PCR analysis\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74136). Reverse\ntranscription was performed on 100 ng of total RNA PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit\n(Takara RR037A). Real-time PCR analysis was performed on a QuantStudio 6 Flex\ninstrument (ThermoFisher) using SYBR green detection system (Applied\nBiosystems, 4367659) and primers specific for Tlr9 (330001/PPM04221A-200),\nTlr7 (330001/PPM04208A-200) and Tlr13 (330001/PPM41490A-200) (all from\nQiagen). Housekeeping genes Gapdh and Hprt were used for normalization. \u0394C_t\nfor target genes was calculated using average C_t of the two housekeeping\ngenes. mRNA amount for each experimental group was expressed relative to naive\ngroup and calculated as \\\\({2}^{\\Delta {C}_{{\\rm{t}}}-\\Delta\n{C}_{{{\\rm{t}}}_{naive}}}\\\\).\n\n### Cytosolic DNA extraction and analysis\n\nCytosolic DNA extraction was performed as previously described^62. DNA was\nextracted using Mitochondria/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (Abcam, ab65320) from\nfresh tissue (dorsal hippocampus) and cleared extracts were treated with 1 mg\nml^\u22121 proteinase K for 1 h at 55 \u00b0C, extracted with phenol:chloroform, treated\nwith RNase A (1 mg ml^\u22121) for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C, and sequentially extracted with\nphenol:chloroform and chloroform. Purified cytosolic DNA was tested for\nnuclear DNA contamination by performing a 40-cycle PCR reaction using primers\nfor vGlut1 (also known as Slc17a7) (forward: GTGGAAGTCCTGGAAACTGC, reverse:\nATGAGCGAGGAGAATGTGG). For cloning of dsDNA, samples were treated with DNA\npolymerase I, large (Klenow) fragment (1 U \u03bcg^\u22121 DNA; NEB), supplemented with\n33 \u03bcM of each dNTP, for 15 min. DNA was precipitated with sodium\nacetate/ethanol as described above, and dissolved in water. DNA samples were\ntreated with Taq polymerase (NEB) for 20 min, and immediately cloned into\npCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. One\nShot competent cells were transformed by adding 2 \u03bcl of the TOPO Cloning\nreaction into a vial of One Shot chemically competent Escherichia coli. Cells\nwere incubated on ice for 30 min, heat-shocked for 30 s at 42 \u00b0C without\nshaking, and immediately transferred to ice. After 5 min, 250 \u03bcl of room\ntemperature SOC medium was added, and tubes were placed horizontally in a\nshaker (200 rpm) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Cells were pelleted at 6,000 rpm for 10\nmin, resuspended in 50 \u03bcl of SOC medium, and spread on a pre-warmed selective\nplate. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. All colonies from each plate\nwere picked and placed into individual wells of a 96-well plate containing 50\n\u03bcl of PBS. The sequence of cloned DNA fragments was determined by direct\ncolony sequencing (ACGT).\n\n### Primary cultures, treatment and live imaging\n\nThe hippocampi from post-natal day 0 (P1) C57BL/6 N male and female mice were\nisolated, and dissociated, as described previously^63. Cells were plated in a\n14-mm-diameter glass dish (MatTek, P35G-1.5-14-C) coated with poly-d-lysine\n(Sigma-Aldrich) at a density of 50,000 cells per cm^2 and grown in neuronal\nmedium (Neurobasal Medium containing 1 mM GlutaMax, and 2% B27, all from\nThermoFisher). Neurons were cultured for 14 days in vitro before treatments.\nCells were treated with 25 \u03bcM N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) for 10 min in fresh\nneuronal medium, washed twice, and incubated for 1 h with PicoGreen (dsDNA\ndye, 1:20,000), CellMAsk (cell membrane dye, 1:1,000), and MitoTracker\n(mitochondria dye, 1:20,000) diluted in neuronal medium. Cells were imaged on\nNikon W1 spinning disc confocal microscope (Center for Advanced Microscopy,\nNorthwestern University), 1 frame per 10 s at 100\u00d7 magnification.\n\n### Immunohistochemistry\n\nMice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 240 mg kg^\u22121\nAvertin and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 150 ml per mouse). Brains were removed and post-\nfixed for 24 h in the same fixative and then immersed for 24 h each in 20% and\n30% sucrose in phosphate buffer. Brains were frozen and 50-\u03bcm sections were\ncut for use in free-floating immunohistochemistry^17 with the primary and\nsecondary antibodies listed in Supplementary Tables 7 and 8, respectively. In\naddition to manufacturers\u2019 validation, all primary antibodies were validated\nby comparison to no primary control samples.\n\n### PNN imaging\n\nPNNs were visualized using Wisteria floribunda lectin (WFA) staining, a widely\nused approach for PNN visualization^40. WFA staining was performed according\nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, endogenous peroxidase was\ninactivated with hydrogen peroxide. Following streptavidin/biotin and Carbo-\nFree blocking, sections were incubated with biotinylated WFA (Vector\nBiolaboratories), Vectastain ABC system, and fluorescein, coumarin or\nrhodamine isothiocyanate (Akoya Biosciences). Sections were mounted using\nFluorSave (Millipore-Sigma).\n\n### Microscopy, image analysis and quantification\n\nLow-magnification images (up to 60\u00d7 magnification) were captured with a Leica\nmicroscope with a Leica DFC450 C digital camera whereas high-magnification\nimages and z-stacks (60\u2013100\u00d7 magnification) were captured using a confocal\nlaser-scanning microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV10i). All quantifications were\nperformed with ImageJ. Clusters of \u03b3H2AX-positive neurons were first\nidentified, and analyses were performed in the surrounding (~100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm)\narea. Thus, the numbers are representative of regions of interest rather than\naverage of the CA1 subfield. For time-course analyses, we counted \u03b3H2AX\nneurons in 180 neurons per mouse (3 consecutive slices of 60 neurons). With 6\nmice per group, this amounted to 1,000 neurons per time point. In most of the\nother molecular targets we counted 60 neurons per mouse using a 60\u2013100\u00d7\nobjective. All images were converted to binary format, and for each cell\nshowing \u03b3H2AX we determined the background and applied a threshold twice above\nthe background signal. We thus obtained similar results across different\nantibodies and conditions. All analyses were performed with Fiji/ImageJ. The\nJACoP Plugin for object-based co-localization was used to determine co-\nlocalization by comparing the position of the centroids of the nuclei of the\ncolour channels. Their respective coordinates were then used to define\nstructures separated by distances equal to or below the optical resolution^45.\nVolume and 3D viewer Plugins were used for 3D reconstruction of z-stacks,\nwhereas plot profile and surface plot functions were used for analyses of\nclusters at lower (40\u00d7) magnification. Coloc2 was used to determine\ncorrelation of expression levels of different fluorophore signals. The analyse\nparticles, plot profile and measure functions were used to determine the\nnumber, size, distribution and distance between indicated signals.\n\n### Fluorescent multiplex v2 RNAscope\n\nNaive mice (n = 4) or mice subjected to CFC (n = 4) were perfused 96 h later\nwith ice-cold 0.1 M PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and processed as\ndescribed above. RNAscope was performed according to the manufacturer\ninstructions. To visualize Hsp90b1 and Dcx mRNA and NeuN protein RNAscope\nMultiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (ACD Biotechne, 323100) and RNA\u2013Protein\nCo-Detection Ancillary kit (ACD Biotechne, 323180) were used. In brief, slides\nwere dried at 60 \u00b0C in an oven for 30 min, dehydrated in ethanol, treated with\nhydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature, washed in water and boiled\nin co-detection target retrieval reagent (around 98 \u00b0C) for 5 min. The\nsections were incubated with anti-Neun antibody (1:500, Sigma, ABN78), fixed\nwith 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (VWR, GEN0786-1056), protease plus, and\nrinsed with sterile water. The hybridization step was performed by incubating\nthe sections with the following probes: Mm-Hsp90b1-C1 (ACD Biotechne, 556051),\nMm-DCX-C2 (ACD Biotechne, 478671-C2), Mm-PPIB (positive control probe, ACD\nBiotechne, 320881) and dabB (negative control probe, ACD Biotechne, 320871)\nfor 2 h at 40 \u00b0C and stored overnight in 5\u00d7 saline sodium citrate. The\nhybridization was amplified with AMP 1 and AMP 2. All amplification and\ndevelopment were performed at 40 \u00b0C, and 2 \u00d7 2 min of washes in ACD wash\nbuffer was performed after each step. For C1 probe TSA Vivid Fluorophore Kit\n520 (Biotechne, 7523) was used, for C2 and C3, positive and negative probes\nTSA Vivid Fluorophore Kit 650 (7527) was used. Sections were incubated with\ngoat anti-rabbit Alexa-568 secondary antibody (1:300, Invitrogen, A11036) and\nDAPI solution (ACD bio), and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant\n(ThermoFisher Scientific, 33342). Images were acquired with an Andor BC43\nspinning disk confocal microscope (Oxford Instruments) controlled by the\nFusion software from Andor, using a 10\u00d7 air 0.45 NA objective, a 60\u00d7 oil\nimmersion 1.42 NA objective, a CMOS camera (6.5 \u03bcm pixel; 2,048 \u00d7 2,000 pixels\ngenerating 16-bit, monochrome images) with no binning. Samples were\nilluminated with 4 fixed wavelengths of 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm and 638 nm.\nDorsal hippocampus overview was obtained with 3 \u00d7 3 stitching (10% overlap)\nusing the 10\u00d7 objective and the region of interest (CA1 pyramidal layer,\nclosest to the midline) was afterward imaged at higher magnification using the\n60\u00d7 objective. Image analysis was performed after thresholding using the\nanalyse particle function in ImageJ using four slices per mouse. The number of\nparticles was analysed per 60 neurons per slice (240 neurons per mouse).\n\n### Fear conditioning\n\nCFC was performed in an automated system (TSE Systems) as previously\ndescribed^29. In brief, mice were exposed for 3 min to a novel context,\nfollowed by a foot shock (2 s, 0.7 mA, constant current). TFC was performed by\nexposing the mice to for 3 min to a novel context, followed by a 30 s tone (75\ndB SPL, 10 kHz, 200 ms pulse), a 15 s trace, and a foot shock (2 s, 0.7 mA,\nconstant current)^63. DFC was performed as described for TFC, except that\ntrace was omitted so that shock immediately followed the end of the tone. At\nindicated time points, mice were tested for memory retrieval by re-exposing\nthem to the same context (context test), or to a tone presented over 30 s in a\ndifferent context (tone test after TFC or DFC). Testing consisted of 3 min in\nthe conditioning context, during which freezing was measured every 10 s.\nFreezing was expressed as a percentage of the total number of observations\nduring which the mice were motionless. Activity was recorded automatically by\nan infrared beam system and expressed in cm s^\u22121. The individual experiments\nwith wild-type mice were not performed on littermates, so we did not apply\nrandomization procedures, but with all genetic lines bred in our facility,\nlittermates were randomly assigned to different experimental groups to\nminimize litter effects. The behavioural tests were performed blindly, either\nby experimentalists who were unaware of the treatments because the solutions\nwere coded or by experimenters unaware of the experimental design. The\nexperimenter performing the tests was not aware of the numbering code.\n\n### Surgery and cannulation\n\nDouble-guided cannulas (Plastic One) were implanted in the dorsal hippocampus\nas described previously^17. Mice were anesthetized with 1.2% tribromoethanol\n(vol/vol, Avertin) and implanted with bilateral 26-gauge cannulas using a\nstereotaxic apparatus (Kopf, model 1900). Stereotaxic coordinates for the\ndorsal hippocampus were 1.8 mm posterior, \u00b11.0 mm lateral and 2.0 mm ventral\nto bregma.\n\n### Pharmacological treatments\n\nAll oligonucleotides and drugs were injected into the dorsal hippocampus at a\nvolume of 0.25 \u03bcl per side, at a rate of 0.15 \u03bcl min^\u22121 using microinfusion\npumps (Model UMP3T-1 UltraMicroPump 3 with SMARTouch Controller). ODN2088 was\ninjected at doses of 125 and 300 ng per mouse corresponding to 4 and 8 nmol,\nrespectively. Based on pilot experiments, the cGAS and STING antagonists were\ninjected at doses of 10 and 50 ng in 250 nl per mouse.\n\nDNase I (Sigma-Aldrich D4513, lot SLCQ3662, diluted in water) was injected\nintraperitoneally with 50 U DNase I in 200 \u03bcl saline, 24 h and 12 h before and\n1 h after CFC, or intrahippocampally with 50 U DNase I per mouse at volume of\n0.5 \u03bcl per side, at a rate of 1 \u03bcl min^\u22121 24 h before and 1 h after test.\nDNase I and S1 nuclease (Thermo Scientific, EN0321) treatment were injected\ninto the dorsal hippocampus at dosage 5 U DNase I + 10U S1 in 20%\nglycerol/artificial cerebrospinal fluid, vehicle: 20% glycerol/artificial\ncerebrospinal fluid 4 h before the memory test. Treatment schedules and doses\nwere designed based on published data^64 and including both high and low doses\nas well as pre-CFC and pre-test injections.\n\nFor depletion of microglia, Pexidartinib (PLX-3397, HY-16749 lot: 212013\nMedChemExpress) was formulated into 5053 PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 at the\nconcentration of 290 ppm (W.F. Fisher and Son). The mice were fed for four\nweeks before the test. LabDiet 5053 served as a control diet. At the end of\nexperiments, all brains were collected for histological determination of\ncannula placements or immunohistochemistry.\n\n### Virus injections\n\nAll viruses (listed in Supplementary Table 9) were injected at a volume of 0.5\n\u03bcl per side, 1.8 mm posterior, \u00b11.0 mm lateral and 2.0 mm ventral to bregma,\nat a rate of 0.15 \u03bcl min^\u22121. At the time of virus infusion, mice were eight\nweeks old. CFC and memory tests were performed from weeks 13 to 17. One day\nafter the completion of behavioural testing, mice were intracardially\nperfused, and all brains were collected, and virus spread was confirmed by\nimmunohistochemical analysis of GFP or mCherry.\n\n### Labelling CFC-activated CA1 neurons using robust activity marking\n\nWe labelled the CA1 neurons in the dorsal hippocampus activated during CFC\nusing doxycycline-off (off-Dox) activity-dependent cell tagging with the\nRobust Activity RAM system^31 coupled to the human Fos minimal promoter with\nfour tandem repeats of an enhancer module (PRAM) as recently described in\ndetail^11. In brief, we put two groups of wild-type mice on a doxycycline diet\none day before injecting AAV2/9-PRAM:d2tTA-TRE:NLS-mKate2 and took them off\nthe diet after 9 days, followed by CFC the day after. Mice were left\nundisturbed in our testing facility without doxycycline for additional two\ndays. Following two days, mice were put back on the doxycycline diet and 96 h\nafter CFC, one group was subjected to memory reactivation (context test) and\neuthanized 1 h later. An additional, non-reactivated group served as control.\nThis later group was only used internally to ensure that there was no Fos\nresponse without memory reactivation.\n\n### Statistics and reproducibility\n\nStatistical power to detect anticipated effect sizes was determined using\npower analysis (calculator at\nhttp://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2.html) conducted on\nrepresentative samples of previous work and pilot experiments. For all\nproposed experiments, minimum power is set at 0.90 to detect an \u03b1 = 0.05 (two-\nsided test) for a difference in means from 20% to 40%, with a 15% common\nstandard deviation. To prevent litter effects, mice from the same litter were\nassigned to different experimental groups. Viruses were injected by\nexperimenters aware of the construct but the mice were then assigned coded\nnumbers by the laboratory technician. The code was available after\nquantification and before analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using\nGraphPad Prism. Mice with misplaced virus infusion or cannulas, and mice with\nless than 70% viral expression in the CA1 were excluded. One-way ANOVA\nfollowed by Tukey\u2019s test was used for post hoc comparisons of three or more\nexperimental groups (only when ANOVA was significant) whereas Student\u2019s t-test\nwas used for comparison of two experimental groups. Homogeneity of variance\nwas confirmed with Levene\u2019s test for equality of variances. On indicated data,\nwe performed correlation analyses and report Pearson\u2019s r coefficients.\nSignificant changes of co-localization or activation (%) were determined using\nthe Chi-square test. A priori determined post hoc analyses following Chi-\nsquare tests were performed using Bonferroni-corrected alpha levels as the\noriginal overall alpha level (\u03b1 = 0.05) was divided by the number of tests\nbeing conducted. These adjusted alpha levels were used as the new significance\nthreshold for each individual test. All comparisons were conducted using two-\ntailed tests and the P value for all cases was set to <0.05 for significant\ndifferences. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Statistically significant\ndifferences are indicated as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P <\n0.0001 and *****P < 0.00001. All cellular and molecular effects were shown in\na minimum of six biological replicates (Figs. 1e and 2e and Extended Data\nFigs. 3f and 9). Two experimental replicates were performed for all time-\ncourse, Tlr9-KO, Rela-KO, Ifnar1-KO and WT\u2013cre experiments (Figs. 1c,d, 2a\u2013d\nand 5a,c and Extended Data Figs. 2\u20134, 11 and 12). All significant behavioural\neffects were replicated at least three times using wild-type, virus-specific\nand cell-specific control groups. All main gene expression effects were\nreplicated with four different approaches (bulk RNA-seq, quantitative PCR\narrays, quantitative PCR and snRNA-seq). Replicates produced similar results\nrelative to initial or representative experiments.\n\n### Figures\n\nFigures were created and edited using Adobe Illustrator CS6 (Adobe, v27.5,\nRRID: SCR_010279).

Nuclei obtained\nfrom hippocampi Tlr9^flox/flox mice injected with Syn-Cre but not exposed to\nCFC were prepared as described in Fig. 4 but separated using fluorescence-\nactivated cell sorting (FACS) and the separated populations of GFP^+ and GFP^\u2212\nnuclei were subjected to snRNA-Seq using the same approaches as described for\nunsorted samples. When compared to the total neuron clusters (left), the gene\nprofiles of GFP^+ nuclei showed a pattern consistent with neuron-specific\nexpression whereas the gene profiles of GFP^- nuclei showed a pattern\nconsistent with expression in non-neuronal cells (right). b Identification of\nmain cell populations based on known markers for neuronal and non-neuronal\ncells. c Examination of cosine similarity of Atp6v0c and Hsp90b1 across\nclusters revealed a coefficient of 0.6 and a significant above chance\nassociation (p < 0.01), suggesting co-expression across cell types (top).\nViolin plots showing up-regulation of Atp6v0c and Hsp90b1 by CFC and down-\nregulation by Tlr9KO (bottom).\n\nSource Data\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 7 Cluster-specific gene expression and presence of\nneuronal markers.\n\na Up-regulation of gene expression after CFC (top) and down-regulation after\nTlr9KO (middle) is predominant in neuronal clusters. A significant correlation\nwas found between CFC increased vs Tlr9 KO decreased changes of gene\nexpression by cluster (top corner). A unique pattern opposite the effect of\nTlr9 KO is seen in cluster 26, showing a strong increase of gene expression,\nmost of which were involved in control of axon guidance and cell-matrix\nadhesion. This cluster uniquely expresses Slc17a6 coding for vGlut2 (see c).\nGene ontology analysis revealing similar patterns of up-regulation and down-\nregulation of functional pathways (bottom). b Neuronal phenotyping with\nconserved markers revealing presence of Dcx in several excitatory and all\ninhibitory neuronal clusters in addition to immature DGGC (cluster 25). c The\nexpression of excitatory and inhibitory neuron markers as well as d CA and\nDGGC markers were consistent with the clustering method and identified\nclusters 0, 7, 11, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 29 as excitatory CA\nneurons, clusters 1-4 as DGGC, cluster 25 as immature DGGC, and clusters 13,\n14, 19, and 23 as inhibitory neurons.\n\nSource Data\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 8 Cluster-specific changes of cellular phenotypes after\nCFC and Tlr9 KO.\n\na CFC induced decrease of GAP43 from excitatory clusters 11 and 24, but the\nmost dramatic effect was the disappearance of Dcx from most excitatory\nclusters (7, 11, 20, 24, 29) and inhibitory cluster 19 (gray stars). This CFC\neffect was prevented by Tlr9 KO (black stars), enabling these clusters to\nretain Dcx while losing Slc17a6. In response to CFC, the most interesting\nchange was in cluster 28, which shifted from an undifferentiated to a mature\nDGGC phenotype (Prox1^+ Calb1^+ Dcx^\u2212), an effect prevented by Tlr9 KO. In\nresponse to Tlr9KO, significant phenotype changes were noted in immature DGGC\n(cluster 25), which lost their excitatory and acquired an inhibitory\nphenotype, and in excitatory cluster 26, which switched from an\nundifferentiated vGlut2^+ Calb1^+ GAP43^\u2212 NeuroD6^\u2212 phenotype to a vGlut1^+\nSatb2^+ GAP43^+ NeuroD6^+ phenotype typical of CA neurons.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 9 Validation of the RNA-seq data using RNAscope.\n\na Low magnification images demonstrating Dcx mRNA expression in newly born\nDGGC as well as in individual CA1 neurons. b Positive and negative controls\n(see Methods for detailed description). c High magnification images\nidentifying Dcx^+ CA1 neurons. d The number of Hsp90b1 signals was\nsignificantly higher in hippocampi 96 h after CFC relative to the na\u00efve group\n(left, representative micrographs; right, n = 4 mice/group, 4 sections/mouse,\n180-240 nuclei/mouse, two-tailed unpaired t test, t_30 = 2.939, p = 0.0063).\nData represented as mean \u00b1 s.e.m., ^nsp > 0.05; ****p < 0.0001; ***p < 0.001;\n**p < 0.01; *p < 0.05.\n\nSource Data\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 10 Analysis of the potential contribution of\ninfiltrating immune cells and cell free DNA to the cellular and behavioral\neffects of CFC and Tlr9.\n\na Violin plots demonstrating lack of detectable infiltrating lymphocytes and\nmyeloid cells in the hippocampus after CFC. Cells positive for\nmacrophage/monocyte markers were identified as microglia based on the presence\nof Siglech, Hexb, and Sall1. b Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of DNase I\nbefore CFC did not affect freezing behavior at test (n = 9 mice/group; two-\ntailed unpaired t test, t_16 = 0.3194, p = 0.7536). c Similar freezing was\nalso found in mice injected with intrahippocampal (i.h.) DNase I or vehicle\nbefore CFC (n = 7 mice/group; two-tailed unpaired t test, t_12 = 0.9197, p =\n0.3758). d Combined i.h. injections of DNase I and S1 nuclease before the\nmemory test did not affect context memory retrieval relative to vehicle\ncontrols (n = 8 mice/group; two-tailed unpaired t test, t_14 = 0.4799, p =\n0.6387). Data represented as mean \u00b1 s.e.m., ^nsp > 0.05; ****p < 0.0001; ***p\n< 0.001; **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05.\n\nSource Data\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 11 Low magnification images demonstrating the extent of\ngenotype-dependent effects of Syn-Cre on dsDNA breaks and 53BP1 recruitment.\n\nImages obtained from two mice per genotype depicting dsDNA breaks (\u03b3H2AX) and\nDDR in neuron-specific knockout of Tlr9 and its downstream signaling genes\nRelA and IFNAR1.
