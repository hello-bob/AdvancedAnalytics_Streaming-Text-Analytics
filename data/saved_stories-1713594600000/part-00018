Charles\nGullung/Getty Images\n\n  * Poor diet can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.\n  * Experts have not yet found any firm causative links between individual dietary components and cancer.\n  * A new study has discovered that methylglyoxal \u2014 which is produced when glucose is broken down in cells \u2014 may help explain the link between poor diet and cancer.\n  * They suggest that a long-term poor diet leads to an increase in the production of methylglyoxal, which switches off cancer-preventing genes, increasing cancer risk.\n\nPoor nutritionTrusted Source is associated with many health conditions, among\nthem obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancers, including those of\nthe breast, uterus, and large intestine. High intakes of sodium, saturated\nfats, and sugars can increase the risk of chronic conditions like heart\ndisease and type 2 diabetes, but what links diet and cancer is less clear.\n\nAlthough many foods are said to be associated with increased or decreased\ncancer risk, according to the National Cancer InstituteTrusted Source, no\nstudies have yet shown that any dietary component directly causes or protects\nagainst cancer.\n\nNow, a study from the National University of Singapore, published in\nCellTrusted Source, has discovered a mechanism that may help to explain why\npoor diet increases cancer risk.\n\nIn cell studies, the researchers found that methylglyoxal, which is produced\nwhen cells break down glucose to release energy, can inhibit genes that\nprotect against cancer. They suggest that poor diet leads to higher levels of\nmethylglyoxal, increasing the likelihood of cancer.\n\n> \u201cThis study suggests a potential correlation between high levels of\n> methylglyoxal, a metabolic by-product, and a genetic mutation pattern seen\n> in some cancers. It is an interesting area to explore further, but we need\n> further lab research and clinical testing to conclusively establish if\n> methylglyoxal levels are directly linked to cancer risk.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Tayyaba\n> Jiwani, science engagement manager at Cancer Research UK, who was not\n> involved in the study, speaking to Medical News Today.\n\n##\n\nBreast cancer gene increases effect of methylglyoxal\n\nMethylglyoxal is a by-productTrusted Source of the metabolism of glucose,\nproteins and lipids. It is a reactive small molecule that can disrupt cell\nfunction, so is broken down by enzymes into less harmful substances. However,\nif too much methylglyoxal is produced, the study suggests, the excess can then\ndamage DNATrusted Source.\n\nThe researchers first investigated the effect of methylglyoxal in cells from\npeople who had inherited a copy of a mutated gene \u2014 BRCA2 \u2014 that increases the\nrisk of breast and ovarian cancers.\n\nThey discovered that methylglyoxal temporarily disabled tumor suppression by\nBRCA2, which could increase the likelihood of cancer developing.\n\nProf. Ashok Venkitaraman, corresponding author, NUS Centre for Cancer\nResearch, National University of Singapore, told Medical News Today:\n\n\u201c[M]ethylglyoxal triggers the destruction of BRCA2 protein, reducing its\nlevels in cells. (It doesn\u2019t prevent expression of the BRCA2 gene.) This\neffect is temporary, but can last long enough to inhibit the tumor-preventing\nfunction of BRCA2.\u201d\n\nMethylglyoxal damaged DNA in cells that had the mutated form of the BRCA2\ngene. Repeated exposure to methylglyoxal increased the level of damage to the\nDNA.\n\n\u201cIt is well documented that some individuals are at a high risk of developing\nbreast, ovarian, pancreatic or other cancers because they inherit a faulty\ncopy of the cancer-preventing gene \u2014 BRCA2 \u2014 from their parents,\u201d Venkitaraman\nsaid.\n\n\u201cOur recent findings show that cells from such individuals are particularly\nsensitive to the effects of methylglyoxal, which is a chemical produced when\nour cells break down glucose to create energy. We find that methylglyoxal\ninhibits the tumor-preventing function of BRCA2, eventually causing faults in\nour DNA that are early warning signs of cancer development,\u201d he added.\n\n##\n\nSimilar effects seen without gene\n\n> \u201cThe study revealed that even individuals without a genetic predisposition\n> might still face an increased cancer risk if they present with elevated\n> methylglyoxal levels. This scenario is commonly observed in those with\n> diabetes or pre-diabetes, conditions often linked with obesity or suboptimal\n> dietary and lifestyle habits.\u201d\n>\n> \u2014 Kelsey Costa, MS, RDN, registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of\n> Dietitian Insights, who was not involved in the study, speaking to Medical\n> News Today.\n\nCosta explained how methylglyoxal might have this effect:\n\n\u201cMethylglyoxal produces a group of complex compounds known as advanced\nglycation end-products (AGEs), which accumulate in the body and contribute to\nvarious health conditions, including diabetes and obesity. These AGEs have\nbeen linked to increased oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are\ncritical factors in cancer development.\u201d\n\nHigh levels of methylglyoxal are common in people with prediabetes and\ndiabetes, and can also result from obesity and eating a poor diet.\n\n\u201cDiabetes is a condition where the body has trouble controlling blood sugar\n(glucose) levels, so people with prediabetes/diabetes have higher than normal\nlevels of glucose. Some of this excess glucose is broken down by glycolysis,\nin turn elevating methylglyoxal,\u201d Venkitaraman told MNT, explaining also that:\n\n\u201cPoor diets rich in sugar or refined carbohydrates are known to cause blood\nglucose levels to spike.\u201d\n\n##\n\nWhat the findings might mean\n\nVenkitaraman cautioned that, as their work was carried out in cells, not\npatients, it would be premature to give specific advice to reduce cancer risk\non the basis of their findings. However, he explained how their work might\ninfluence thinking about genes and cancer:\n\n\u201cOur work also revises a longstanding theory about certain cancer-preventing\ngenes. This theory \u2014 called the Knudson\u2019s \u2018two-hit\u2019 paradigmTrusted Source \u2014\nwas first formulated in 1971 and proposed that these genes must be inactivated\npermanently in our cells before cancer can arise.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur latest findings show that methylglyoxal can temporarily inactivate such\ncancer-preventing genes, suggesting that repeated episodes of poor diet or\nuncontrolled diabetes can \u2018add up\u2019 over time to increase cancer risk,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nDr. Jiwani cautioned that more research was needed to confirm the effects of\nmethylglyoxal:\n\n\u201cThe study shows that exposing cancer cells in the lab to high levels of\nmethylglyoxal can transiently deplete the tumor-suppressor protein BRCA2,\nincreasing the risk of DNA damage. But this alone doesn\u2019t prove that these\ncells will go on to become cancerous. Additional research is needed to see if\nthese same effects occur in the more complex contexts of our tissues, organs,\nand bodies, where metabolic reactions and by-products are intricately\nregulated.\u201d\n\n##\n\nMore evidence that diet affects cancer risk\n\nCosta told MNT that this research provides another reason to try and follow a\nhealthy diet:\n\n\u201cDiets rich in unhealthy processed foods, red meats, added sugars, and refined\ngrains, like the typical Western diet, may lead to an increase in\nmethylglyoxal due to metabolic dysfunction, posing a risk for various\ndiseases, including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and an\nelevated risk of cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs is often the case, the best way to reduce methylglyoxal production and\nmaintain metabolic, microbiome, and overall health is to eat a balanced,\nplant-forward diet that is rich in dietary fiber and bioactive compounds, with\na focus on whole and minimally processed foods,\u201d she advised.\n\nOne diet often advocated for improving health is the Mediterranean diet and,\nCosta said, and there is now evidence that it might reduce methylglyoxal\nlevels.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in a recent study,\u201d she said, \u201cfollowing a Mediterranean diet was\nlinked to lower methylglyoxal levels in the bloodstream, which appeared to\nhelp maintain kidney health among individuals with type 2 diabetes and\ncoronary heart disease.\u201d\n\n### From our expert nutritionists\n\nDiet or Leave it: Keto Diet\n\nCurious about keto diets?
