We are immensely proud of this\naccomplishment and grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the ongoing\ndialogue in software engineering.\n\nMarkus Borg, our Principal Researcher, was at the conference in Lisbon to\npresent the paper.\n\n\"We are deeply honored to have received this award. Managing technical debt is\na key business concern, and CodeScene offers unique opportunities in this\narea. Receiving recognition from the scientific community is profoundly\nmeaningful to us, it serves as a strong affirmation that our data lake is\nvaluable and that our analytical approach is sound. Few tool vendors can\nshowcase an equally research-based foundation.\"\n\nMarkus Borg, Principal Researcher, CodeScene at the TechDebt Conference 2024\n\n## Increasing, not Diminishing: Investigating the Returns of Highly\nMaintainable Code\n\nThis research explores how the quality of source code affects business\noutcomes and the implications for software development organizations. Key\nquestions include how code health relates to defect counts and development\ntime, and how different levels of code health impact value creation.\n\nTo answer these questions, the researchers analyzed data from 46,000 source\ncode files. They used polynomial regression to examine the correlation between\ncode health and defect counts, and developed a pragmatic model to assess value\ncreation.\n\n### Their findings show that:\n\n  * Code health has a negative correlation with defect counts for low and high levels of code health, with no clear correlation in between.\n  * Development time decreases steadily as code health improves, with uncertain trends at extreme code health levels. The study also reveals non-linear relationships between code health and value creation, with increasing returns at higher levels of code health.\n\nThe insight gained suggests that improving code maintainability has tangible\nbenefits, supporting software evolvability beyond just a measure of developer\npride.\n\nThe call to action emphasizes the need to communicate the business value of\ncode quality to executives, informing strategic decisions around refactoring\nand development priorities.
