In a bid\nto heap pressure on his coalition partners to amend the law, Mr Wissing said\nthat he would have to enforce a ban on weekend driving to abide by the law\nunless it was changed before mid-July.\n\nThe Greens accused Mr Wissing of stirring up unfounded fears at a time when\nGerman enthusiasm for climate-friendly legislation is at a low ebb during the\ncost of living crisis.\n\nJulia Verlinden, the Green\u2019s parliamentary group leader, said there were other\nways to tackle pollution, including introducing a speed limit on the nation\u2019s\nautobahns.\n\nHowever, a speed limit on the motorways is controversial. Mr Wissing has ruled\nit out, as have opposition parties the CDU and hard-Right Alternative for\nGermany.\n\nMr Wissing defended his comments, saying: 'I told the citizens the truth. You\ncan only save such large amounts [of pollution] by giving up cars and trucks'\nCredit: Liesa Johannssen/Reuters\n\nGreenhouse emissions in Europe\u2019s biggest economy fell to the lowest level in\n70 years in 2023, but the transport sector has been consistently failing to\nmeet its climate targets.\n\nAccording to the current climate protection law, the ministry responsible for\nunderperforming sectors must launch an immediate programme to put them back on\ntrack.\n\nMr Wissing has not yet done so. His ministry claims reforming the sector is\nmore challenging than other areas of the economy because it affects people\u2019s\neveryday lives and cannot be changed quickly.\n\n\u201cA corresponding reduction in traffic performance would only be possible\nthrough restrictive measures that are difficult to communicate to the\npopulation, such as nationwide and indefinite driving bans on Saturdays and\nSundays,\u201d he wrote in a letter dated Thursday to coalition parliamentary group\nleaders.\n\nThe letter was heavily criticised by coalition partners and environmental\ngroups.\n\n## \u2018Scaremongering through absurd proposals\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is not responsible for a minister to stir up unfounded fears,\u201d Katharina\nDroege, the Green Party parliamentary group leader, said on Friday.\n\nDetlef Mueller, the SPD deputy parliamentary group leader, said the gambit\nwould not move the negotiations forward.\n\n\u201cScaremongering through absurd proposals does not help climate protection in\nthe transport sector at all, on the contrary,\u201d he said.\n\nClara Thompson, mobility expert at Greenpeace, told the German Press Agency:\n\u201cWissing has wasted two years blocking every climate protection measure in\nroad traffic - now he is coming up with horror scenarios so that he won\u2019t have\nto do anything in the future either.\u201d\n\nHowever, Christian Lindner, the FDP party leader and finance minister,\nsupported the threat.\n\n\u201cThe climate protection law of the previous government could soon lead to\ndriving bans,\u201d he wrote on social media.\n\nThe transport ministry said the minister\u2019s letter was not a threat but rather\nexpressed the opinion that parliament should live up to its responsibilities\nand agree upon the amendment.\n\nA spokesman for the ministry said: \u201cIt is a minister\u2019s responsibility to point\nout the dangers.\u201d\n\nMr Wissing defended himself on German radio on Friday, saying: \u201cI told the\ncitizens the truth. You can only save such large amounts [of pollution] by\ngiving up cars and trucks.\n\n\u201cThose like Greenpeace and the Greens, who always say that the climate\nprotection law must remain as it is, may now be frightened by the consequences\nof their policies.\u201d\n\nThe climate protection law was introduced by the centre-Right CDU when it led\nthe government under Angela Merkel.\n\nNow in opposition, it is leading in the polls after a string of disputes\nbetween the coalition members.\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Germany,\n  * Net Zero,\n  * Climate change,\n  * Pollution,\n  * Europe\n\n363\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
