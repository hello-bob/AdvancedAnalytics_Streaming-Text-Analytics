Specifically, war correspondents with\nphotojournalist Lee Smith (Kirsten Dunst) in the lead role. Lee is from a\nlaconic old guard of photojournalists. She\u2019s travelled around the world\ncapturing images of humanity at its more wrought, raw, and worst.\n\nIn the world of Civil War, where a fascist President has taken over the White\nHouse and the Western Forces of California and Texas have fought back in a\nconflagration on US soil, Lee is unconvinced of the power her photography has.\n\u201cEverytime I survive a war-zone, I thought I was sending a warning home.\n\u2018Don\u2019t do this.\u2019 But here we are,\u201d she muses.\n\n  * More than 450 Jewish creatives denounce Jonathan Glazer\u2019s \u2018The Zone of Interest\u2019 Oscars speech\n  * Euronews Culture's Film of the Week: 'Civil War' - Alex Garland's jaw-droppingly tense thriller\n\nMuch of the conversation around Civil War \u2019s themes have discussed the film\u2019s\npointed apoliticism. It\u2019s rarely clear which army the journalists are side-by-\nside with although there are moments \u2013 notably the scene with Jesse Plemons \u2013\nwhere nationalism and racism are directly implicated as, at the very least,\nresults of war. For this article though, I want to focus on how the film\ndialogues with images of war, just as Lee questions it aloud herself in the\nplot.\n\nAs Lee and her ragtag group of journalists travel from New York to Washington\nin their efforts to seal a final interview with the President (Nick Offerman)\nbefore the Western Forces\u2019 imminent sieging of the capital, the film is\ninterspersed with the images Lee and her colleagues have taken.\n\nSaying the quiet part out loud - Jesse Plemons in Civil War A24\n\nThere are shots of a public square, moments after a suicide bomber detonated,\nthe streets littered with the bleeding dismembered. We get stills of bodies,\nhanging from posts with their executioners posing beside. Soldiers are forced\non their knees, awaiting oblivion.\n\nThere are also flashbacks through Lee\u2019s career with shots of her travels to\nthe far-flung lands she saw ravaged by war firsthand in her futile mission to\npreach the horror of bloodshed to her own people.\n\nAll of this is shot beautifully by Garland. Of course it is. He\u2019s the writer\nwhose early works were helmed by the supremely talented Danny Boyle before he\nwent on to direct his own gorgeously framed films Ex Machina, Annihilation and\nMen.\n\nOutside of the film\u2019s still moments which reflect on the nature of Lee\u2019s work,\nevery shot of Civil War is either artfully composed when reflecting on war\u2019s\nterror or gleefully bombastic when engaging in the thrill of it.\n\nThese two emotions are thematically sensible, given part of Garland\u2019s point is\nthe way war correspondents are driven both moralistically and by adrenaline.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more scared and more alive at the same time,\u201d Lee\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9\nJessie Cullen (Cailee Spaeny) says at one point.\n\nThe other reason for Civil War 's presentation is that Garland is, at his\ncore, an incredibly competent director who loves slickly made films. It\u2019s this\nquality that is the film\u2019s contention. Garland\u2019s images are brutal but\nbeautiful. Just as Lee questions how impactful images of foreign wars were to\nher countrymen, does Garland\u2019s transposition of these images to a US setting\nactually create any weight to their message?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an anti-war film,\u201d goes the Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut-\nattributed quote that has been rehashed to death by this point, but films like\nCivil War are in direct conversation with the line. Truffaut alluded to the\ninevitably of putting guns, explosions and life-or-death situations on screen\nbeing titillating to audiences.\n\nGarland avoids a plot that simply splits the US by its current political\ndivisions in order to strike home the violent calamity of war through the\nimagery of its cruelty alone. Yet with the state of US politics as it is,\nwould the images of soldiers storming the White House and summarily executing\nits Trumpian president not excite a certain cohort of Americans meant to rue\nthe message of the film?\n\nIn its semi-apoliticism, Garland has attempted to transpose the visual horror\nof war onto a familiar territory while removing the context of war. I believe\nit\u2019s rooted in the humanistic belief that war could be averted if only people\nremembered their shared humanity over their differences.\n\nBut while the amnesia to shared humanity is one cause of war, it isn\u2019t it\nalone. Context does matter to understanding how war proliferates. While the\nsudden realisation of shared humanity would certainly stop the awful\nbombardement that Gazan civilians face from Israel, the wider Middle Eastern\nconflict that threatens as the detente between Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel\nis unsettled still looms, for example.\n\nThe combination of Garland\u2019s semi-glorifying imagery and his simplistic war-\nwithout-context theme mean Civil War makes a far thinner point than the\ndirector probably intended. It\u2019s the complete inverse of another film, the\nsublime The Zone of Interest.\n\nThe Zone of Interest tells the story of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss\u2019s\nfamily life living besides the concentration camp without ever showing an\nimage of the horrors within. Garland directly praised Jonathan Glazer\u2019s film\nin a recent interview for the podcast \u2018Script Apart\u2019 for the way it respects\nthe intelligence of its audience.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe Zone of Interest simply assumes that you have certain kinds of\ninformation available to you. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nWhile Civil War is a film of images without context, The Zone of Interest is\ncontext alone. If you\u2019d never heard of Auschwitz and the Holocaust, you\u2019d\nlikely find it to be an unsettling if nonsensical film. Garland\u2019s own point is\nthat Auschwitz and the related imagery around it \u2013 trains, smoke, striped\npyjamas \u2013 are a part of an intelligent viewer\u2019s knowledge to the extent that\nit only needs to be invoked indirectly for the message of its wickedness to be\nconveyed.\n\nAmong the praise heaped on The Zone of Interest, many have argued its\npurposeful eschewing of images of Jewish suffering means it manages to pass\nthat infamous Truffaut test of war films.\n\nThe evil at the heart of H\u00f6ss enjoying his middle-class lifestyle, ambivalent\nto the suffering the audience knows is happening on the other side of his\nfence is far more effective at communicating the depths humanity can sink to\nwhen it forgets empathy than bombastic images of helicopters spraying bullets\nat government buildings. Glazer achieved something incredible in making The\nZone of Interest a genuine anti-war film. Garland\u2019s Civil War might just be an\naction movie.\n\nShare this article Comments\n\n## You might also like\n\nNow playing Next\n\nCulture news\n\n### Charred scroll from Vesuvius reveals Plato's death\n\nNow playing Next\n\nCulture news\n\n### International Jazz Day: How you can celebrate in Europe\n\nNow playing Next\n\nCulture news\n\n### Beyonc\u00e9 and flat earths: What new words enter the French dictionary?\n\nCivil War Cinema film Journalism United States\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Top stories\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Why are we still being scammed by immersive art exhibitions?\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## The Best Film of All Time revealed by Rotten Tomatoes\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Celebrated US novelist Paul Auster dies aged 77\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Esther art fair brings Estonian flair to Manhattan\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Iranian authorities ban film crew from attending Cannes Film Festival\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Most read\n\n### 'Miss AI': World's first beauty contest with computer generated women\n\n### Exhibition shines light on Claude Monet's overlooked brother Leon\n\n### Greek helmet discovered in Croatia may rewrite tribal history\n\n### G\u00e9rard Depardieu has been taken into custody\n\n### Charred scroll from Vesuvius reveals Plato's death\n\n# 'Miss AI': World's first beauty contest with computer generated women\n\n'Miss AI': World's first AI beauty contest with computer generated women -\nCopyright Fanvue\n\nCopyright Fanvue\n\nBy David Mouriquand\n\nPublished on 25/04/2024 - 11:23\u2022Updated 15:25\n\nShare this articleComments\n\nShare this article\n\nFacebookTwitterFlipboardSendRedditMessengerLinkedinVK\n\nDystopian nigtmare or the future of beauty contests?

The winner will go home with $5,000 (\u20ac4,600) cash and an \"imagine\ncreator mentorship programme\" worth $3,000 (\u20ac2,800).\n\nThe co-founder, Will Monanage, has said he\u2019s hoping it will become \u201cthe Oscars\nof the AI creator economy.\u201d\n\n\"The creator economy is an extremely exciting place to be in right now, and\nwith the help of our platform, there\u2019s been exponential growth in AI creators\nentering the space, growing their fanbases, and monetising content,\" added\nMonanage.\n\nThe panel of judges - two human, two AI generatedFanvue\n\nBritain's pageant historian Sally-Ann Fawcett is part of the panel of judges \u2013\none of the two human judges, as the panel includes AI models Emily Pelligrini\n(who became 'famous' last year after footballers and other celebrities\napparently wrote to her believing she was real) and Aitana Lopez, a pink-\nhaired fake Spanish model who earns up to \u20ac10,000 a month for her male creator\nby modelling clothing for brands.\n\nFawcett said in a recent interview with British outlet the Daily Mail: \"As one\nof the world\u2019s only traditional pageantry historians it\u2019s really exciting to\nbe involved in an awards which feels so futuristic.\"\n\n\"Interestingly, there are so many parallels between real life pageantry\ncontestants and AI creators, and how they engage with their audiences,\" she\nadded.\n\nAmidst the concerns that AI is threatening job security and artistic\nprofessions, this move into the pageant industry just feels like the\norganizers have come up with the following: \u201cConsidering real beauty pageants\nare criticised for dehumanising women, lets dodge that bullet by having\ncontestants which aren\u2019t human to begin with!\u201d\n\nBright sparks.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that a pageant of this nature further exacerbates\nunrealistic beauty standards through now computer-generated \u2018perfection\u2019. And\nthere\u2019s also no Mr AI competition yet, reinforcing once more a misogynistic\nstreak to the gendered beauty norms.\n\n\"What would be your one dream to make the world a better place?\"\n\nFor this toxic-feeling stunt to be a prank.\n\nAdditional sources \u2022 Daily Mail\n\nShare this articleComments\n\n## You might also like\n\nNow playing Next\n\nCulture news\n\n### Daniel Radcliffe speaks out on J.K.

It's not entirely clear which member of the Lieser family was the\nmodel.\n\nKlimt left the painting, with small parts unfinished, in his studio when he\ndied of a stroke in early 1918 and it was given to the family who had\ncommissioned it, according to the auction house.\n\nThe Jewish family fled Austria after 1930 and lost most of their possessions.\n\nIt's unclear exactly what happened to the painting between 1925 and the 1960s,\na period that includes the Nazi dictatorship.
