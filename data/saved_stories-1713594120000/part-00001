Television, Hanna-Barbera\n\nAs a child of the 1980s, my perception of the smart home has been dominated by\nthe idea that one day, we will all have Rosey the Robot-style robots roaming\nour homes \u2014 dusting the mantelpiece, preparing dinner, and unloading the\ndishwasher. (That last one is a must; we were smart enough to come up with a\nrobot to wash our dishes; can\u2019t we please come up with one that can also\nunload them?)\n\n### Related\n\n  * Boston Dynamics\u2019 new Atlas robot is a swiveling, shape-shifting nightmare\n  * Make robots hairy\n\nHowever, after seeing Boston Dynamics\u2019 latest droid, Atlas, unveiled this\nweek, my childhood dreams are fast turning into a smart home nightmare. While\nThe Jetsons\u2019 robot housekeeper had a steely charm, accentuated by its frilly\napron, the closer we come to having humanoid robots in our home, the more\nterrifying it appears they will be. Not so much because of how they look \u2014 I\ncould see Atlas in an apron \u2014 but more because of what they represent.\n\nWith its bipedal, hardcore yogi moves, Atlas is a new all-electric humanoid\nrobot from Boston Dynamics. And while the next generation of the company\u2019s\nAtlas program is designed for commercial use, they tout it as being capable of\ndoing work that\u2019s \u201ctoo dangerous, too hard, or too dull and dirty\u201d for us\nhumans. Three of those things definitely apply to the home.\n\nWhile Atlas seems intentionally designed to feel menacing \u2014 or at least far\nfrom cuddly \u2014 the technology on show here makes it easy to connect the dots to\nthe creation of a humanoid home robot. Nvidia is working on that very thing,\nrecently announcing the launch of Project GR00T Foundation model for humanoid\nrobots. \u201cBuilding foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the\nmost exciting problems to solve in AI today,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of\nNvidia, said of the launch. \u201cThe enabling technologies are coming together for\nleading roboticists around the world to take giant leaps towards artificial\ngeneral robotics.\u201d\n\nAs a child of the aforementioned \u201980s, artificially intelligent robots are the\nstuff of nightmares. The Terminator series embedded the fear of the robot\nuprising in the psyche of my generation, and things haven\u2019t gotten much\ncheerier since.\n\nIsn\u2019t it cute? Anthropomorphizing household appliances has its charms ... and\nits chills.\n\nPhoto by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nHowever, pop culture aside, it\u2019s clear that robotics have a place in our\nhomes. The question is, should we be working toward an all-capable, bipedal,\nhuman-like bot to take everyday chores off our hands? The more I think about\nit \u2014 and the more robots I have roaming around my home \u2014 the more I think the\nanswer is no. We don\u2019t need a robot that understands what we say and can\nreplicate our movements; we need robots that do one job (or maybe two related\njobs) and do them well.\n\nI have more experience than most with home robots. Amazon\u2019s Astro robot rolled\naround my house for two weeks. I\u2019ve played with an ElliQ companion robot,\ntested dozens of robot vacuums and mops, and currently have two robot\nlawnmowers patrolling my garden. Not to mention the various smart speakers\nscattered around my home, packing artificial intelligence inside, including\none with a screen on a robotic arm that swivels to face you when you talk to\nit (yes, it\u2019s creepy). If there is a robot uprising on the cards, I\u2019ll be the\nfirst to go.\n\nWhen robots do their job, they are very useful. When they go wrong, they can\nwreak havoc\n\nWhen robots do their job, they are very useful. When they go wrong, they can\nwreak havoc. I\u2019ve had a robot lawnmower cut down my husband\u2019s favorite plants\nand a robot vacuum knock over a chair, causing a domino effect that ended in a\nsmashed window. Unsupervised mechanical devices moving around your home come\nwith consequences, and the fewer responsibilities \u2014 and appendages \u2014 you give\nthem, the less catastrophic those will be when things go wrong, and the better\nthey will do the job they\u2019re designed for.\n\nA robot that can fold clothes, a dishwasher that can empty itself, a stovetop\nthat can saut\u00e9 the garlic and onions, these are the innovations I\u2019d like to\nsee. Some have been attempted; others seem like the stuff of Samantha\u2019s\nkitchen in Bewitched. All seem safer, simpler, and ultimately more comfortable\nthan having a six-foot robot roaming around my house.\n\nComfortable because when my self-emptying dishwasher breaks, I can responsibly\nrecycle it and get a new one. When my humanoid robot housekeeper reaches the\nend of its firmware updates, I\u2019ll have to put it out to pasture.\n\nReading about how Atlas\u2019 predecessor, having reached the end of its purpose,\nhas been decommissioned and is now a fixture in the lobby of Boston Dynamics,\nI felt a tinge of sadness. It brought to mind the heartbreaking final moments\nof Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s excellent novel Klara and the Sun.\n\nAnthropomorphizing appliances \u2014 imbuing them with human characteristics and\nhuman-like intelligence \u2014 brings with it a whole host of complicated\nchallenges around the nature of consciousness and the boundaries of humanity.\nThis is not something I want to deal with when it comes to a dishwasher.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\n## PSVR 2: future of VR, tethered to the past\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nSony\u2019s PSVR 2 launches February 22nd for $549.
