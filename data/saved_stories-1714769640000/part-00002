Thank goodness we're finally going to get to try painting lovely ivy-\ncovered walls across a pastoral canvas: Pounce Light says a demo is coming on\nMay 30.\n\nTiny Glade, from everything we've seen so far, is a very laid back building\ngame that takes after some of the procedural building elements so many people\nenjoyed in Townscaper but with its own deeper set of building tools. You can\ndraw castle-y curtain walls, raise towers, and scatter your choices of\nwindows, lights, and other decor. Bits of your project will respond to one\nanother as you build, like walls sprouting an arched gateway when you draw a\nfootpath leading up to its edge.\n\n(Image credit: Pounce Light)\n\nIn its blog post, Pounce Light says that in the demo we'll be able to play the\n\"summer glade\" map, the sunny, grass plains and woods backdrop that we've seen\nin so many of its sneak peeks and posts. From a screenshot, it looks like\nwe'll be able to build structures and paths, place windows and lights, and\nchange paint colors and terrain heights. There's a flower symbol in the\ntoolbar as well which I'm guessing is related to placing landscaping details.\n\nThe developer says it's also added the much-requested photo mode in which\nplayers can move about their camera to take the exact screenshots they want.\nWill my own tiny glade be my new phone and desktop background? Likely.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\nThe Tiny Glade demo will drop on May 30 and will stay up throughout the Steam\nNext Fest\u2014scheduled to run from June 10 - June 17 this year\u2014\"and perhaps for a\nweek or two after\u2014we shall see once when we get there,\" Pounce Light says. So\nthat's going to be a solid two and a half weeks, at least, to give it a try.\n\nTiny Glade hasn't announced a release date for its full version, but it's\nexpected sometime in 2024 and it's definitely one of the upcoming cozy games\nI'm most excited for this year.\n\n## Comic deals, prizes and latest news\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nLauren Morton\n\nAssociate Editor\n\nLauren started writing for PC Gamer as a freelancer in 2017 while chasing the\nDark Souls fashion police and accepted her role as Associate Editor in 2021,\nnow serving as the self-appointed chief cozy games enjoyer.
