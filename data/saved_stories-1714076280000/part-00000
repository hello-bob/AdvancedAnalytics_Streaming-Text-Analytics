Tammy Baldwin,\nD-Wis., said the changes are actively harming the Postal Service and its\ncustomers.\n\nThey praised DeJoy for issuing a \u201ctransformative plan,\u201d but said the policies\nhave led to declining service, higher prices and lower mail usage. The\nlawmakers blamed ongoing price hikes for declining mail volumes and said the\napproach would continue to drive business away from the Postal Service.\n\n\u201cIt has become clear that under the DFA, USPS is continuing to implement\nchanges that are harmful to Americans and the American businesses that rely on\nthe service,\u201d the senator said. \u201cAs the board of governors, you must step in\nbefore further harm is caused.\u201d\n\nThe letter was the latest in a series of concerns voiced by members of both\nparties and congressional chambers, though it went further in calling for the\ntermination of the Delivering for America plan altogether. After initial\nbacklash to DeJoy\u2019s selection and his early reform efforts, temperatures\ncooled as lawmakers worked with the postmaster general to pass the 2022 Postal\nService Reform Act and allowed him some leeway to enact his vision. As\nconsolidations and mail rerouting efforts hit individual member\u2019s states and\ndistricts, however, that friction is rebuilding.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing last week, DeJoy defended his plan and said he was\ncommitted to seeing it through. He told members of the Senate Homeland\nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee that their influence helped shape\nthe formation and structure of the reform effort and a return to the previous\nstatus quo would mean a continuation of the \u201cfinancial death spiral\u201d that\npredated his arrival.\n\nIn addition to pricing concerns, DeJoy repeatedly faced questions about his\nnetwork changes that has led to some disruptions of mail delivery. The DFA\nplan has included consolidating mail sorting away from individual post offices\nin favor of centralized centers and moving processing operations away from\nhundreds of cities and towns in favor of 60 mega-centers throughout the\ncountry. As part of a new initiative, USPS is also rolling out an \u201coptimized\ncollection plan\u201d that will require mail to sit overnight at post offices\ninstead of being collected each evening for transportation to a processing\ncenter.\n\nMail delays have spiked across the country and performance has been\nparticularly poor in areas piloting the new network structure, leading DeJoy\nto apologize and promise improvements. He added, however, that his efforts\nwill bear fruit if given appropriate time.\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to criticize when you show up at the crime scene and see the\ndamage, but the path there is long and people are working very hard to change\nminds and hearts in terms of how we perform,\u201d the postmaster general said.\n\nUSPS earlier this month announced it is planning in July to raise the cost of\na First Class stamp to 73 cents from 68 cents as part of a proposal to raise\noverall prices by 7.8%. The increases, if approved by the Postal Regulatory\nCommission, would mark the sixth hike under DeJoy\u2019s tenure and a 31% spike in\nthe cost of a stamp since he took office. USPS has begun raising its rates on\na biannual basis and DeJoy has tapped into the authority he won in 2020 to\nincrease prices more than the rate of inflation on nearly every allowable\noccasion.\n\nApproval of the increases will amount to a simple checking of the math to\nensure postal management has stayed within the permissible formula.\n\nThe Postal Service lost $6.5 billion in fiscal 2023, despite DeJoy\u2019s initial\nprojection that it would break even that year. The significant price hikes\nenabled USPS to grow revenue\u2014by 1% for packages and 2.1% for First Class\nmail\u2014despite volume declines in both categories. Still, critics derided the\nongoing strategy as contributing to a spiral of less use of the mail system.\n\n\u201cPrice hikes are driving disastrous declines in mail volume, which is still\nthe biggest money-maker for the USPS,\u201d said former Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kan.,\nwho now leads Keep US Posted, a nonprofit comprised of large-scale mailers and\nother postal stakeholders. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Postal Regulatory Commission to\nhit the brakes on price increases, and for Congress to take a hard look at the\nnumbers and how they affect the financial solvency of the U.S. Postal\nService.\u201d\n\nThe postal board\u2014in its current composition\u2014is unlikely to heed the senators\u2019\ncall, as Chairman Roman Martinez recently defended the Delivering for America\nplan at a Senate hearing. The board \u201ccontinues to support the DFA plan and\nPostmaster General Dejoy\u2019s efforts,\u201d Martinez said, adding the changes were\n\u201ccritically necessary\u201d and created \u201cthe only viable path\u201d for USPS to regain\nfinancial self-sufficiency. Martinez said the plan is working as intended and,\ndespite some setbacks, simply needs more time to unfold.\n\nThe board could soon veer from its current path, however. Amber McReynolds was\nrecently named its vice chair, and she took the occasion to voice an openness\nto change.\n\n\u201cIt is OK to celebrate success while also being open to ideas for further\nimprovement and adjustments to the DFA, if needed, as challenges arise or\nconditions change,\u201d McReynolds said.\n\nPresident Biden has also nominated his former Labor Department Secretary Marty\nWalsh to fill one of the two vacant Senate-confirmed spots on the board.\nWalsh\u2019s confirmation would give Biden his sixth nominee on the panel and the\nformer secretary would be the fourth Democrat to sit on the board, joining\nthree Republicans and one independent. Federal statute requires no more than\nfive members of the board be of the same party, meaning Biden could choose\nanother Democrat to fill the remaining vacancy.\n\nDeJoy is also facing pressure from the postal regulator, with whom he has\nfeuded since taking office. At last week\u2019s hearing, PRC Chairman Michael\nKubayanda said the Postal Service\u2019s performance is trending in the wrong\ndirection and suggested the commission may issue a renewed advisory opinion on\nthe mailing agency\u2019s network changes.\n\nA spokesperson for the Postal Service said it had not yet received the letter\nbut would respond to the senators when it does.\n\nShare This:\n\nNEXT STORY: Bipartisan group looks to push IRS towards simpler math error\nnotices\n\nManagement\n\nReinventing government: Reflections 30 years later\n\nWorkforce\n\nRetiring NTEU President Reflects on 3 Decades in Organized Labor\n\nManagement\n\n'Long, Long Overdue': An Oral History of the GPRA\n\nWorkforce\n\nState of the Unions: A New Normal\n\nOversight\n\nWhat I Learned Covering Government for 34 Years\n\nsponsor content\n\nWhy KVM is Winning Over VMware vSphere\n\nManagement\n\nReinventing government: Reflections 30 years later\n\nWorkforce\n\nRetiring NTEU President Reflects on 3 Decades in Organized Labor\n\nManagement\n\n'Long, Long Overdue': An Oral History of the GPRA\n\nWorkforce\n\nState of the Unions: A New Normal\n\nOversight\n\nWhat I Learned Covering Government for 34 Years\n\nsponsor content\n\nWhy KVM is Winning Over VMware vSphere\n\n\u00a9 2024 by Government Media Executive Group LLC.
