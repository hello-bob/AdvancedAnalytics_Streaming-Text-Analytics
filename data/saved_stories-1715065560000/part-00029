More programming languages will be supported in the future!\n\n# We're excited to have you onboard with Spectral!\n\nWith Spectral, you can easily navigate your codebase, visualizing the\nconnections between functions and variables on an infinite canvas, similar to\na map.Future features include real-time code editing, debugging on the\nSpectral canvas, adding annotations, and a multiplayer collaboration mode.As\nSpectral is still in its early stages, there are many bugs to address and we\nare all ears for feature requests! If you encounter any issues or want to\nsubmit feature requests, please help us by creating a GitHub Issue at\nSpectral-community, or contact us at fron@spectral.wiki. Feel free to include\ndetailed descriptions and visuals such as screenshots or screen recordings of\nthe bugs.\n\n# Running Spectral\n\nTo use Spectral, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Open any JavaScript (JS) / TypeScript (TS) file and place your cursor at any arbitrary function name (or if its anonymous function, place the cursor at the function signature)\n  2. Right click on that function and pick Trace with Spectral (or Press CTRL + SHIFT + S) to start navigating your code in Spectral, beginning at that arbitrary function\n\nNote: If you are using a mouse, hold the right-click button and drag the\ncursor to pan the canvas around\n\n# Spectral Features  \n  \n---  \n  \n  * Contact us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy\n  * Manage cookies\n  * Terms of use\n  * Trademarks\n\n\u00a9 2024 Microsoft\n\n", "frontpage": false}
