If so, we may have to rethink our\nunderstanding of the universe\n\nBy Miriam Frankel\n\n15 April 2024\n\nryan wills; Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images\n\nEver feel like you are stuck in a hole? Newsflash: you are. Astronomers call\nit the \u201clocal hole\u201d, but that is quite the understatement. It is vast,\ngigantic, enormously huge \u2013 although, in truth, adjectives fail us when it\ncomes to this expanse of nothingness. It is the largest cosmic void we know\nof, spanning 2 billion light years. Our galaxy happens to be near its centre,\nbut the trouble with this hole isn\u2019t that it presents a proximate danger \u2013\nmore that it shouldn\u2019t exist at all.\n\nThat is, if one of our most firmly held beliefs about the cosmos is true. That\nassumption, known as the cosmological principle, says that the universe\u2019s\nmatter should be evenly distributed on the largest scales. It is the\ncornerstone on which much of modern cosmology is built. If the void is real,\nthen that stone might be crumbling.\n\nFor this reason, few dared to believe the void could be genuine. But evidence\nhas mounted in recent years, and astronomers have moved from doubt to\nbegrudging acceptance. They have also discovered other similarly vast\nstructures. So now the question is being asked with increasing urgency: if we\nreally are living in a void, do we need to drastically modify our models of\nthe cosmos? That might involve rethinking gravity, the nature of dark matter,\nor both.\n\nWhy the big bang may not have been the beginning of the universe\n\nWe once thought the big bang was a single moment, but physicists are now\nsettling on a different version of events, writes Chanda Prescod-Weinstein\n\nThe idea that the universe has the same character through and through can be\ntraced back at least as far as Isaac Newton. He argued that the motions of the\nstars and planets can be explained...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Sign up to our weekly newsletter\n\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!
