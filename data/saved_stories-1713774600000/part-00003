For the builders of the world faced with a\njigsaw puzzle of partial digital solutions and chronic labor and supply chain\nissues, the margins are growing ever-thinner and the necessity is to change or\nperish.\n\nMore Stories\n\nLifestyle\n\nYouTube inventor makes explosive pool cue, then plays his friend\n\nArchitecture\n\nDanish green-roof beach house boasts sustainable sophistication\n\nBritish company Automated Architecture (AUAR) has a thoroughly ingenious\nsolution and it has enlisted an all-star cast of financial backers in short\norder: Morgan Stanley, ABB Robotics, Rival Holdings (USA), Vandenbussche NV\n(Belgium) with VCs such as Miles Ahead and Bacchus Venture Capital (Jim\nHorowitz et al) helping to get the initial idea off the ground.\n\nAUAR partners with home builders and contractors in Europe and North America,\nlicensing its micro-factory and all the digital technology to build low-energy\nhomes at the price of normal homes, at any scale. The idea is to provide the\ntools to empower local ecosystems of communities, contractors, architects and\ndevelopers to build better homes.\n\nThe Automated Architecture Business Model\n\nAUAR\n\nAUAR licenses the company\u2019s low CapEx robotic micro-factories and the entire\ntech stack required to run them, with prices starting at $300,000 plus an\nongoing licensing fee. Their licensees will be existing home builders, who\nwill be able to build homes more cost-efficiently at any scale. AUAR's\ncustomer profile is a home builder with a minimum of \u00a320m turnover per year.\nThere's about 3,000 of these potential customers across EU and North America.\n\nGiven robots don't need sleep or pay and work considerably faster than humans\n(who are in chronic short supply), AUAR\u2019s building system is expected to cut\nlabor costs by 30% and supply chain, transport and logistics costs by 80%.\n\n\u201cThe average home has about 7000 parts, each with a different supply chain,\u201d\nsays AUAR's co-founder and CEO Mollie Claypool. \u201cWe have one primary material,\nand only a few supply chains.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need for affordable low-energy homes, but building high-\nquality, sustainable timber homes is hard to scale, and AUAR intends to change\nthat. Robots and AI allow us to deliver high-quality housing at significantly\nlower costs, increasing margins and productivity while lowering the cost for\nthe end users. By using our solution, construction companies can hit their\nsustainability targets at a cost they are comfortable with.\u201d\n\nEach $300,000 AUAR micro-factory enables an approximate USD $1.3 million per\nyear revenue creation opportunity for home builders, removing the barriers to\nthe widespread adoption of robotics in the construction industry.\n\nAUAR's system is already being deployed, with the first micro-factories\nopening in Europe last month, and conversations underway with potential\npartners in Canada, Spain, Sweden, Portugal, France and the Netherlands.\n\nAUAR's first partner in the United States will be Indiana-based Rival\nHoldings, a company that emerged in 2023 with the merger of two already strong\ncompanies with the same vision. Ambassador Supply and VIA Developments formed\none company to better enable their intention to operate at the forefront of\nchange in the American construction industry, and AUAR was one of the\ncompany's first investments. Rival might be new in name, but it already\noperates 16 companies in 10 states, with over 800 employees.\n\nRival CEO Brad Crawford explained the creation of the venture company thus:\n\u201cAs our industry grows and evolves, it is critical that we focus on\ntechnology, innovation and disruption. Rival is a company that will work to\ncatalyze innovation and growth, through a holistic view of the real estate and\nconstruction industry, and a willingness to take risks and explore\npossibilities.\u201d\n\nAUAR's first partner in Europe will be Belgian-based Vandenbussche, which\nopened its first micro-factory in March 2024\n\nVandenbussche / Foto-Atelier De Rammelaere\n\nAUAR is targeting 40 licence partners for its micro-factories by 2030, with a\ncapacity to produce over 75,000 energy-efficient homes by then, but clearly\nthe industry is seeking a way to become more efficient and with two large\npartnerships in play already, the AUAR model also scales, and if the\nefficiencies can be proven, we expect this business model to be the path of\nleast resistance between two massive needs.\n\nMcKinsey Global Institute\u2019s March 2024 report on investing in productivity\ngrowth, summed up the imperative: \u201cToday the world needs productivity growth\nmore than ever. It is the only way to raise living standards amid aging, the\nenergy transition, supply chain reconfiguration, and inflated global balance\nsheets.\u201d\n\nThe World Economic Forum has been touting the micro-factory concept for quite\nsome time, even though this micro-factory explainer was only published in\nMarch 2024. At right, construction industry journal Construction Dive\nchronicles some of the productivity woes of the American Industry.\n\nwords words\n\nIn a similar report on improving construction productivity from a global\nperspective, McKinsey wrote: \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that the industry is on the\nverge of disruption, and industry players are actively working on new\napproaches. How organizations are preparing to deal with the disruption varies\ngreatly\u2014though most recognize that failure to adapt could result in being left\nbehind.\n\n\u201cTo cope with disruptive pressures, some have taken incremental approaches to\nadopting best practices by establishing small, discrete programs. Others have\ncreated transformational agendas designed to work within the current confines\nof the industry. Still others are making significant strategic bets to\nradically restructure the value chain or establish manufacturing-like systems\nof mass production.\n\nThese two reports form McKinsey Global Institute are essential reading if you\nfind the micro-factory concept intriguing. At left is the March 2024 report on\ninvesting in productivity growth, and at right is the 2017 report on\nReinventing Construction\n\nMcKinsey Global Institute\n\nIt is unclear which approach will win in a given market segment\u2014but\nunderstanding the challenge and the opportunity to address it is a crucial\nfirst step.\u201d\n\nThe most heralded of the new enabling technologies coming to the construction\nindustry is the micro-factory \u2013 a small-scale, high-tech automated\nmanufacturing facility with a broad range of process capabilities that can be\nscaled up by replicating identical small cells in large numbers. AUAR's robot\ncells are quite compact, making it an affordable, quickly deployable and\nscalable solution.\n\nIn addition, the operating system uses AI, which makes it easy to generate a\ndesign and convert it into building elements. This means that the operator\nworking with the robot only has to validate the process. As a result, this is\nthe ideal solution to the productivity problem that the sector has been facing\nfor years.\n\nBy 2030, the company aims to have a network of 40 partners and have its cells\nbuilding 75,000 homes per year.\n\nThat might sound like an ambitious target, but we expect more success, more\nfunding, and more scaling well before then.\n\nWe expect that once this model has proven itself, the rush will be on to\ntransform the building sector and AUAR will be at the forefront of this\nchange.\n\n\"I am convinced that we can help transform the housing market,\u201d says AUAR's\nMollie Claypool.\n\nSo are we.\n\nView gallery - 8 images\n\nGood Thinking\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\nNo comments\n\nMike Hanlon\n\nAs a photojournalist, Mike\u2019s work has been published in a dozen languages\nacross 20+ countries.
