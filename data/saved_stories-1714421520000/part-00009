A preprint^1 posted on 16\nApril reported the discovery of the virus in raw milk from infected cows, and\nUS federal authorities said on Wednesday that the virus had been found in lung\ntissue collected from a seemingly healthy cow.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, US officials confirmed at a media briefing that genomic\nmaterial from the H5N1 strain, which is causing the outbreak, had been\ndetected in milk sold in shops.\n\nDetection of viral particles in milk sold to consumers suggests that avian flu\nin cows could \u201cbe more widespread than initially thought\u201d, says food scientist\nDiego Diel at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \u201cIncreased surveillance\nand testing in dairies should be an important part of control measures going\nforward.\u201d Nature looks at the implications for human health and the future of\nthe outbreak.\n\n## What does it mean that H5N1 is in retail milk?\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how many milk samples the FDA has tested or where the\nsamples were collected. The agency said that it would release more information\nin the coming days and weeks.\n\nAfter it leaves the farm and before it hits the shelves, milk is pasteurized\nto inactivate pathogens. To detect H5N1, the FDA used a test called\nquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which picks up viral RNA.\nBecause it detects fragments of the viral genome, the test cannot distinguish\nbetween living virus and the remnants of dead virus, says dairy scientist\nNicole Martin at Cornell University.\n\nBird flu outbreak in mink sparks concern about spread in people\n\n\u201cThe detection of viral RNA does not itself pose a health risk to consumers,\nand we expect to find this residual genetic material if the virus was there in\nthe raw milk and was inactivated by pasteurization,\u201d she says.\n\nThe presence of viral material in commercially available milk does have\nbroader implications, however. There are several possible explanations, says\nvirologist Brian Wasik, also at Cornell University. It could be that the\noutbreak is more pervasive than farmers realized, and that milk from infected\nanimals is entering the commercial supply. Another possibility, he says, is\nthat \u201casymptomatic cows that we are not testing are shedding virus into milk\u201d.\nBut it\u2019s also possible that both scenarios are true.\n\nUS federal rules require milk from infected cows to be discarded, but it\u2019s not\nyet clear whether cows often start shedding the virus before they look sick or\nproduce abnormal milk. The 16 April preprint, which has not yet been peer\nreviewed, includes reports that milk from infected cows is thicker and more\nyellow than typical milk and that infected animals eat less and produce less\nmilk than usual.\n\n## Is milk with traces of H5N1 in it a threat to humans?\n\nThere is no definitive evidence that pasteurization kills H5N1, but the method\nkills viruses that multiply in the gut, which are hardier than flu viruses,\nsays Wasik. \u201cInfluenza virus is relatively unstable,\u201d he says, \u201cand is very\nsusceptible to heat.\u201d Pasteurization of eggs, which is done at a lower\ntemperature than pasteurization of milk, does kill H5N1.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that pasteurization would be less effective at killing\nrelatively high viral concentrations in milk, says Wasik. Finding out whether\nthis is the case requires experimental data. In the absence of a definitive\nanswer, keeping milk from infected cows out of the commercial supply is\nextremely important.\n\nWhen Nature asked when to expect more evidence on whether pasteurization kills\nH5N1, Janell Goodwin, public-affairs specialist at the FDA in Silver Spring,\nMaryland, said that the agency and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)\n\u201care working closely to collect and evaluate additional data and information\nspecific to\u201d H5N1.\n\n## Is milk spreading bird flu among cows?\n\nUSDA researchers have tested nasal swabs, tissue and milk samples of cows from\naffected dairy herds and have found that milk contained the highest viral\nconcentrations. This indicates that the virus could be spreading through milk\ndroplets.\n\nBird-flu threat disrupts Antarctic penguin studies\n\nIf so, milking equipment could be involved. \u201cThe teat cups of a milking\nmachine could transfer remnants of H5N1-containing milk from one cow to the\nteats of the next cow being milked,\u201d says virologist Thijs Kuiken at Erasmus\nUniversity Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. \u201cEven if they are\nwashed and disinfected, the levels of virus in the milk of infected cattle are\nso high that one could not exclude the possibility of infectious virus being\ntransferred from cow to cow by this route.\u201d In fact, in some equipment set-\nups, workers spray down milking machines with high-pressure hoses to clean\nthem, which would aerosolize any infected milk, says Wasik.\n\nThe USDA website concurs that viral spread is \u201clikely through mechanical\nmeans\u201d.\n\n## Is enough being done to stop the spread?\n\nThe FDA announced on Wednesday that cows must test negative for bird flu\nbefore they can be moved across state lines. That might help to stem the\noutbreak, scientists say. Animals in the US dairy industry move around a lot,\nWasik says. Calves are moved to be raised into milk cows, cows are moved when\nthey stop producing milk and farmers sell the animals. Such movement is\nprobably \u201ca main driver\u201d of the outbreak, Wasik says.\n\nDiel would like to see surveillance of bulk milk samples at farms. Wastewater\ntesting and environmental sampling could be useful, too, Wasik says,\nparticularly around farms near outbreaks or farms where cows have been moved.\nHe also advocates for a quarantine or observation period of 24 or 48 hours\nwhen cattle are moved to a new farm.\n\nSuch surveillance measures \u201ccould really buy us time, slow down the outbreak\u201d,\nsays Wasik, so researchers and agencies can \u201cget a better handle on it.\nBecause time is what\u2019s of the essence.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01221-2\n\n### Updates & Corrections\n\n  * Correction 26 April 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the name of the agency that annnounced that one in five milk samples tested positive for avian-flu remnants.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
