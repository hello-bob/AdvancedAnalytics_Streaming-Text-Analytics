It makes me feel desperate: a rare warm day followed\nby another sleet storm, the high-octane days of summer still impossibly far\naway.\n\nIn May 2019, I was crawling out of my skin. The high-elevation north-facing\ntrails were still sheets of ice and the south-facing trails were shoe-sucking\nmud. I was so sick of my gym routine that I\u2019d sit in the parking lot for 20\nminutes, willing myself to go inside.\n\nI\u2019d moved to Montana from the northeast nearly a decade before, drawn to lofty\nmountains to reinvent my tame life in suburban New Hampshire. I immediately\nbegan compiling a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of outdoor activities: I learned to mountain bike,\nbecame a strong climber, checked peaks off my list, and worked as a horseback\nguide. Backcountry recreation was the social currency and my value hinged on\naccepting every invitation, so I did my best to learn everything.\n\nBut no matter how many skills I picked up, my struggles with asthma meant I\noften fell behind. I was the last one to the top of the switchbacks, watching\nmy lean, muscled friends vanish over the ridge as I sucked air through a\nwindpipe that felt like a crumpled straw.\n\nI made up for those cardio challenges with an uncanny ability to reject fear.\nI volunteered to go first on intimidating climbing routes, humming to stay\ncalm as I gripped miniscule edges and pressed my feet against glassy slabs of\nrock. I fell often, once catching my leg behind the rope and flipping upside\ndown, my head ringing as I smashed into the wall. My belayer called up in a\npanic and offered to lower me, but I was already pulling myself up the rope\nbefore I\u2019d stopped swinging. My self-worth banked on being the most fearless,\ncamping in winter storms, grabbing the reins of the horse who had thrown me,\npulling pebbles out of my knees and joking about how hard I\u2019d hit the ground.\n\nThat frenetic activity level of summer and winter made spring\u2019s dullness\nharder to bear. I craved movement in the backcountry and the social life that\ncame with it. Kadin texted me one of those afternoons when I was flopping\naround the climbing gym mats delaying my workout. He was a climbing partner,\ndecently good friend, river guide, and enough of an enigma that I wasn\u2019t sure\nwhether I had a crush or he just had enough mystique to seem appealing.\n\nHe asked if I had a kayak.\n\nI responded right away. Yeah, an old river runner. You looking to get out this\nweek?\n\nMy kayak was a 15-year-old Wave Sport Frankenstein I\u2019d picked up at a pawn\nshop the year before. I\u2019d spent that summer paddling the reservoir south of\ntown, occasionally running a calm section of the Madison River. The boat was\nnarrow and prone to tipping. I planned to take a roll clinic the following\nsummer, as I was determined to gain aptitude in yet another outdoor sport\u2014just\nenough to feel confident on beginner whitewater.\n\nThe section of the Gallatin River that Kadin wanted to run was near my house,\neasily accessible and less intimidating than anything in the canyon. Despite\nbeing an open section of water, it was still technically early-season\nconditions, ice cold and scattered with hazardous deadfall. I accepted the\ninvitation immediately.\n\n> Despite being an open section of water, it was still technically early-\n> season conditions, ice cold and scattered with hazardous deadfall. I\n> accepted the invitation immediately.\n\nI didn\u2019t consider whether or not I was comfortable paddling that stretch.\nAlong with the desire to keep up with my peers, my ability to assess risk was\nskewed after years of narrow backcountry escapes, a well-documented phenomenon\nwhere your risk perception shifts after successfully navigating unpredictable\nsituations. From outrunning lightning storms to losing the trail to tackling\nclimbs well above my grade, I\u2019d encountered plenty of tenuous scenarios and\nalways figured it out, scraping by without too much damage.\n\nThe Adventure Experience Paradigm describes this well; it uses a simple line\ngraphic to show the interplay of risk and competence. When the risk is low and\nthe skills are high, the person is toward the bottom of the chart in the\n\u201crealm of exploration and experimentation.\u201d When competence and risk are\nbalanced, the participant is in the middle, and when risk exceeds competence,\nthe outcome can be catastrophic. The more experience someone has with\nnavigating risky situations, the more confident they become, skewing the\nvariables. My boating experience was minimal and that section of river was not\nfor beginners, but I had scraped by enough times that my risk assessment was\ndangerously off-kilter. It was a really, really bad combination.\n\n> My boating experience was minimal and that section of river was not for\n> beginners, but I had scraped by enough times that my risk assessment was\n> dangerously off-kilter. It was a really, really bad combination.\n\nNone of this was on my mind a few days later as I grabbed my kayaking gloves\nand neoprene booties and dragged my boat out of the garage. I raked a finger\nthrough the cobwebs stretching across the seat as Kadin\u2019s truck rumbled into\nmy driveway. We crammed both boats in the bed of my truck, shuttled his truck\nto the takeout, and I drove us back to the start.\n\nThe wind was brisk as we unloaded the boats, whipping my hair against my face\nand pushing puffy white clouds across the sky. I inched down the embankment\ntoward the blown-out river, swollen from snowmelt and moving faster than I\nthought. Icy water splashed my toes and I slipped in the slick mud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I brought the booties,\u201d I shouted over the water. Kadin gave me a\nthumbs up and tossed his spare spray skirt in my direction.\n\nThe river at this time would have been around 40 degrees, frigid with snowmelt\nand choked with trees and other obstacles lodged in the current. These lodged\nobstacles, called \u201cstrainers,\u201d make normally moderate sections extremely\ndangerous, allowing water through but not a boat. Getting pinned underwater\nagainst a wall of debris is just one of the ways you can die on a river. It\ndidn\u2019t occur to me to be scared.\n\nTo a casual observer, the fact that I owned a boat and a few kayaking\naccessories gave the appearance I knew what I was doing. But technical boating\nis a far cry from my mellow paddling experience. I lacked the reflexes and\nskills to navigate faster water, plus my boat was outdated and difficult to\nstabilize. But the excitement of finally getting outside, the relative rarity\nof an invitation from Kadin, plus my other narrow escapes pushed out any seed\nof doubt. I lowered myself into my kayak.\n\nKadin\u2019s spare spray skirt barely fit over the cockpit and I couldn\u2019t get\nenough leverage to secure it. He crouched over my boat, wrestling with the\nneoprene until it strained across the opening.\n\n\u201cCan you pull that off if you have to?\u201d He secured his own spray skirt and\npushed himself toward the water.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answered honestly. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of tight.\u201d\n\nHe paused. \u201cDo you want to practice?\u201d\n\nHis hesitancy annoyed me.\n\nI knew I should make sure I could release it, but my brain raced through two\nscenarios: if I couldn\u2019t pull the spray skirt, it would be clear we shouldn\u2019t\nrun this section\u2014I\u2019d be trapped underwater if I flipped my boat and couldn\u2019t\nroll. But if I pulled it on shore and couldn\u2019t put it back on, Kadin would\nhave to help me again and I\u2019d look silly and inexperienced. I shook my head\nand dug my paddle into the embankment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, let\u2019s go. I\u2019m not going to flip my boat.\u201d\n\nMy boat wasn\u2019t cooperating the instant I dropped into the river. The water was\ntoo fast and unpredictable. Every time I tried to adjust course, I was\nbuffeted by the current. I scolded myself to paddle like I knew how, but this\nwasn\u2019t the type of kayaking I was used to\u2014my reflexes were slow and instincts\nincorrect. My boat\u2019s slim bow dipped and rose, and I flexed my legs against\nthe thigh braces in an attempt to stabilize. An icy splash of water streamed\ndown my jacket. I knew I shouldn\u2019t be on the water.\n\n> I knew I shouldn\u2019t be on the water.\n\nI was desperate to be off the river but I also wasn\u2019t in control. That\nrealization turned into panic as I was catapulted forward in the current,\nglancing sidelong at the bank rushing by and knowing I didn\u2019t have the skills\nto eddy out. Too much was happening too quickly. The spray skirt felt like a\nvise around my waist.\n\nA wave hit me in the face and I gasped, swiping a hand across my eyes as I\nheard Kadin yell behind me.\n\n\u201cStay to the left! Maggie, the left!\u201d he shouted.\n\nI turned to hear him better, and when I looked forward I had dropped into a\ntrough and the current swept me to the right.\n\nI blinked to clear water from my eyes and saw why Kadin had yelled to stay\nleft. I was heading right toward a massive strainer, topped by a downed tree\nat head height. It was as thick as my torso, the gnarled root ball creating a\ndam for a jagged pile of broken logs.\n\nI threw my arm out and collided with the tree with a sickening whack. Before I\ncould take a breath, my boat flipped and I was underwater.\n\nOh no, I thought. I am in so much trouble.\n\nIt was silent underwater, yellowish-green and brighter than I would have\nthought. Fist-sized rocks bouncing next to my head were the only indication of\nhow fast I was moving.\n\nYou\u2019re moving, which means you\u2019re not pinned against the strainer. Get air.\nYou have to roll.\n\nI\u2019d never practiced rolling a kayak\u2014the roll clinic was still on my long list\nof goals\u2014but I knew to snap my hips into the side of the boat and leverage\nwith the paddle. My boat was built to roll, but I had no muscle memory to draw\nfrom to actually execute the move. I also had no paddle\u2014it had been ripped\nfrom my hands when I hit the tree.\n\nI threw my hips into the side of my boat. It rocked a few inches, then settled\nback.\n\nI fought panic. Try again, you need to get air.\n\nI threw my hips harder into the side of the boat. Nothing. The effort took\nenergy and energy took oxygen. A countdown started in my head. I only had a\nfew minutes to get out of the boat. How long had I been underwater?\n\nWet exit. Pull the spray skirt.\n\nI frantically felt for the grab loop, but I was upside down and disoriented.\nWhen I found it after wasting more precious seconds, I leaned back and pulled\nas hard as I could. It didn\u2019t budge. More seconds went by. My heart started\nthudding more rapidly and I felt that familiar aching burn when you stay\nunderwater too long.\n\nA thought came into my head, momentarily paralyzing me: these might be your\nlast few minutes.\n\nMy clumsy gloved hands scrabbled uselessly at the edges of the neoprene\ntrapping me in the boat. As I realized I couldn\u2019t release the spray skirt that\nway either, panic, regret, and sorrow flooded my brain.\n\n> As I realized I couldn\u2019t release the spray skirt that way either, panic,\n> regret, and sorrow flooded my brain.\n\nPlease no. Please don\u2019t let it end like this.\n\nThis is where my brain split into two tracks running at the same time: a\nsadness track and an action track.\n\nThe sadness track focused on my family. My parents and three younger siblings\nall still lived in the Northeast. They supported me but didn\u2019t understand my\ndrive to keep pushing, and they continuously begged me to be careful. I\nthought about my mother, wracked with nerves whenever I\u2019d casually recount\nanother close call. I thought about my dad. His cancer had just relapsed; my\nfamily was already suffering. My drowning would destroy them.\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry for my family, I made a mistake and I wish I hadn\u2019t\ncome here and I\u2019m sorry.\n\nThe action track said: keep trying until it\u2019s over.\n\nI smashed my hip into the side of my boat again, and this time I rocked it\nenough to hear the roar of the water and feel air on one side of my face. I\nsucked in a half-breath, half-mouthful-of-water before rolling under again,\nbuying myself incrementally more time. I wondered if Kadin had seen me roll,\nif he knew what was happening.\n\nMy heart sped up even more and I felt a new sensation in my chest: a dark hole\nwith a deep burn around the edges. Still being pulled downriver, I watched my\nhourglass run out as I tried one last time to roll, but I was too tired and\nbarely moved the boat.\n\nI knew then that I didn\u2019t want my last few minutes to be full of sadness and\nregret. If I wasn\u2019t going to survive this, I didn\u2019t want my final thoughts to\nbe berating myself for a bad choice.\n\nIt\u2019s OK, I thought. You didn\u2019t mean for this to happen. You are going to die\nand you should just be grateful for the time you had.\n\nThe heavy, black ache in my chest fully replaced the burn. I forced myself to\nkeep my eyes open and watch the sunbeams like I\u2019d seen a thousand times\nbefore, when I\u2019d been underwater by choice and could come up for air when I\nwanted.\n\nMy vision spotted and wavered. I thought about my family one more time, trying\nto send a message through the river and into the air I couldn\u2019t reach: I\u2019m so\nsorry, I love you, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\n\nI read somewhere that we\u2019re all unreliable narrators, even for our own\nstories.

I just know I opened my eyes to the blue sky\nstudded with clouds I thought I\u2019d never see again, and that I felt the spring\nair whipping against my face. He told me I made a noise, a choking moan that\nsounded like a dying animal. He thought: she still might not make it.\n\nThings came into focus one at a time: Kadin\u2019s arm across my chest, the\nbruising strike of his legs as he lifeguard-dragged me to an eddy, my head\npropped out of the water on his shoulder.\n\nOnce I fully came to, I thrashed away from him, swimming an adrenaline-fueled\nfreestyle to the bank and digging my hands into the mud to pull myself out. I\ncollapsed in a heap, threw up river water, tried to stand, fell down. Kadin\nleaned over me and pressed my shoulders down, his eyes darting over my face,\nhis own hollow with fear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m OK, I\u2019m fine.\u201d My voice sounded like it was run through a grater. Once I\nstarted shivering, I couldn\u2019t stop.\n\n\u201cMags, I thought you were a goner.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened,\u201d I asked, \u201chow did you get to me?\u201d\n\nHe told it like this: he saw me collide with the strainer and flip my boat. He\npaddled after me as fast as possible, watching my upside-down kayak, waiting\nfor me to roll. He kept a countdown in his head, and when I didn\u2019t surface, he\nbeached his boat on a sandbar, ripped off his spray skirt, and dove into the\ncurrent, swimming as hard as he could until he reached me.\n\nHe grabbed my boat as it flew downriver with my unconscious body dangling\nunderneath. He tried to roll me, but my dead weight made it impossible, so he\nhung on the rounded hull until he found the grab loop to release the spray\nskirt and rip me out upside down.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how long I was underwater. You can suffer irreversible brain\ndamage after five minutes without oxygen, but my half-breath had bought me\nmore time. If Kadin hadn\u2019t seen me flip, missed my boat in the current, or\ntaken another minute to reach me, it would have been over.\n\nWe staggered along a dirt road, cut through a field, then followed another\nroad to where we\u2019d dropped his truck. We didn\u2019t talk.\n\n\u201cDo you need me to go home with you?\u201d he asked when we got back to my truck.\nHis hands trembled on the steering wheel. We were both freezing.\n\n\u201cNo, go home. I\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. I was always fine.\n\nIt took three tries to get the key into the ignition. The sound of the engine\nmade me jump.\n\nFoot on brake. Reverse. Drive. Gas. My leg trembled so hard on the pedal the\ntruck shuddered.\n\nI drove home with both hands on the wheel; I left my drenched clothes in a\nheap in the entryway. I turned the shower on, but the sound of the water sent\nshock waves through my body and I slapped the knob back off. Reeking of river\nwater, I crawled into bed and willed the shaking to stop.\n\nThe next few days passed in a blur. I emptied the trash, checked the mail. Fed\nmy cat in the morning and evening, responded to the most basic work emails.\nDazedly coordinated an upcoming potluck dinner that I didn\u2019t think to cancel.\n\nWhen I told friends what happened, I called it \u201cthe kayak accident\u201d and kept\nit flippant. I told them that yes I\u2019d nearly drowned, but no they shouldn\u2019t\nworry, care, or ask about it. When they did worry, care, and ask about it, I\nsnapped like a cornered dog. No questions. I said I didn\u2019t want to talk about\nit.\n\nI maintained this barbed facade, but inside I was coming apart. I woke up each\nnight gasping for air. Sometimes my face was buried in my pillow and sometimes\nI\u2019d been holding my breath. How do our bodies know to keep breathing? I\nwondered. Is it safe to fall asleep?\n\nBruises blossomed from my thighs to my shins. My hips ached from slamming into\nthe boat, and I was so tired I had to hold onto the wall walking upstairs.\nWhen I showered, I huddled terrified against the wall, trying to wash my hair\nwithout the water hitting my face.\n\nI hosted the dinner party a week later. To cancel would have meant I was\nexhausted and scared, and if I was exhausted and scared, I was weak. If I was\nweak, I was worthless. So instead of calling Kadin and telling him I wasn\u2019t\nOK, or asking him if he also wasn\u2019t OK, or talking to my family, or writing in\na journal, I opened my front door to a dozen friends and drifted through the\nwarm noise of music and conversation. Where are the serving bowls? Do you want\nme to put this in the oven? Does Maggie have an ice maker?\n\nHalfway through the night I grabbed a bowl of food scraps to toss in the\ncompost. The din dulled to near-silence as I stepped into my backyard and\npulled the slider shut. Loud to quiet. Above water to under water. OK to not\nOK.\n\nLike dripping wax, the patio and window glow melted together, and a muted\nthrumming pounded in my ears. I slid down the side of my house as pinpricks\nspotted my vision and my breathing went ragged and gasping. It was my first\npanic attack from the accident, but it wouldn\u2019t be my last.\n\n> It was my first panic attack from the accident, but it wouldn\u2019t be my last.\n\nIt got worse after that. I was haunted by a newfound fear of consequences,\nmade worse by a desperation to maintain my fearlessness, the basis of my self-\nworth. I still went outside, but I was terrified. A creak overhead meant a\nbranch was about to crush me, clouds gathering over a distant peak meant a\nlightning strike. I camped at an alpine lake and lie awake in my tent,\npicturing yellow eyes watching from the trees. I never got back in my kayak.\n\nMore distressing than this new timidness were the dissociative episodes that\nstarted shortly after the accident. Multiple times each day I would find\nmyself drifting out of reality, wondering how everyone was coping after my\ndeath.\n\nMy final thought before losing consciousness had been accepting my own death,\nand part of my brain still existed in the space where I never woke up. I\u2019d\nstare at my hands in yoga, splayed like pale starfish on the mat, and wonder\nwhat flowers my mom had chosen for my memorial. A stab of anguish as I walked\nto the mailbox: had my little cat been brought back to the animal shelter, or\nhad one of my friends taken him in? Then I\u2019d blink and be back in yoga class\nor standing in front of my mailbox with the key held limply in my hand.\n\nThese flashes of dissociation became more frequent. I had to remind myself\nevery day that I hadn\u2019t died\u2014I still lived in my house with the flowering\nperennial bed and mismatched thrift-store furniture. My family hadn\u2019t gathered\nin Montana to sort out the accumulation of debris that made up my life.\n\nIt seemed too dramatic to call it PTSD. Was I so fragile that a few minutes\nunderwater had such an impact? I didn\u2019t even know if the accident could be\nclassified as a near-death experience. I hadn\u2019t seen the light at the end of a\ntunnel or felt myself leaving my body. I hadn\u2019t even needed to be\nresuscitated\u2014hypoxia caused me to plummet into unconsciousness, but as soon as\nI reoxygenated, my body started to function and I could breathe on my own. I\nfelt weak and fragile, unable to quantify what was happening and too ashamed\nto confront the poor decisions that led me there.\n\nDespite my denial, what was happening to my brain was a form of dissociation\nfrom the traumatic event, and a noted element of PTSD. People who have come\nclose to death report more dissociative responses than other trauma survivors,\nand while the episodes typically do eventually fade, the more I tried to\npretend I was OK, the longer they would last.\n\nIt took weeks to tell my family what had happened, and I did it in a rush\nthrough the crackly Bluetooth connection on my way to the grocery store.\n\n\u201cI had a close call kayaking a few weeks ago,\u201d I told my mom, rattling through\nthe bullet points before she could interject. Hit a downed log, flipped my\nboat, trapped underwater, my friend got to me in time, it was fine.\n\nShe responded, slowly, but I wasn\u2019t listening. The words I wanted to say felt\nlodged in my throat, and I ran them through my head like dialogue with the mic\ncut off.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m dead or alive. Every night I wake up feeling like I\u2019m\nsuffocating and if a loud room goes quiet I have a panic attack. I\u2019m sad and\nscared and I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t die or if there\u2019s a reason I survived and\nwhy I ignored all of the risk and almost killed myself.\n\nI didn\u2019t say any of that, but I did surprise myself by blurting out an apology\nbefore I hung up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I said, horrified as I got choked up. \u201cI love you guys and\nI won\u2019t do anything stupid like that again.\u201d\n\nKadin was the only one I thought I trusted to talk about it, though when he\nfinally called me one evening a few weeks later, I still couldn\u2019t drop my\nveneer.\n\n\u201cI just think . . . you know . . . you could have died, and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cIt really scared me seeing you not come up for air, and I don\u2019t know\nhow to talk about it and I\u2019m sorry I brought you out there.\u201d I paced around in\nmy kitchen, holding my phone at arm\u2019s length like I could be electrocuted\nthrough the speaker.\n\nI fumbled a response, still managing not to say anything honest or raw. I\u2019ll\nthank him later, I told myself, when I tell him what\u2019s been going on in my\nbrain. Maybe he\u2019s going through the same thing.\n\nAfter that conversation we settled into a quiet understanding: two guarded\npeople who had narrowly escaped a serious consequence.\n\nOnce we established a different rapport, I saw a lot of Kadin. What would have\nthrilled me before (acceptance) was now a relief (someone who understood).\n\nWe climbed together and took long drives into the mountains. We hiked picnic\nfood up to a remote lake, and once we recovered the kayaks from the river, I\nstored them both in my garage. I felt deeply connected to him, though I fought\nthe idea since he was still the enigma that kept me chasing the end of a\nstring, picking at the knot to see if it could be unraveled.\n\nNo one else heard the noise I made as the air came back into my lungs. No one\nelse had beached their boat and swam toward me as alpine runoff deadened their\nlimbs. No one else kept their eyes on my upside-down boat and no one else\nrisked the current and strainers to drag an unconscious girl out of a kayak.\nIf he\u2019d waited another few beats, missed the sandbar, not connected with my\nboat as the current carried him past, I would have died.\n\n\u201cYou two have some sort of weird bond,\u201d my friend muttered as I slide-tackled\nKadin on the gym mats one day that fall.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, he saved my life.\u201d At that point, she knew to nod and not ask\nme to elaborate.\n\nHe was still Kadin, though, trauma bonded or not. He\u2019d disappear for a month\nat a time, not return my calls, skip our planned yoga classes.\n\nMy brain had reached more of an equilibrium by then. I still drifted in and\nout of reality, wondering who had taken over my house and which one of my\nfriends had my cat. But I\u2019d just smile apologetically to whoever I was with as\nI startled back to reality.\n\n\u201cSorry, can you repeat that? I was spacing out.\u201d\n\nFall rolled into winter and our boats hadn\u2019t left my garage. I brushed off the\ncobwebs and hung them on hooks, telling myself I\u2019d talk to Kadin in the spring\nand confront the accident, possibly ask if he wanted to take the roll clinic\nwith me. I\u2019d feel safer with him there. Maybe it would close the gap and allow\nme to move on.\n\nIn the meantime, I spent that winter trying to understand the event from a\nclinical perspective.\n\nI replayed the accident obsessively in my head, ashamed at my choices while\ntrying to understand where they\u2019d come from. I blamed my personality, I blamed\nliving in a mountain town, I blamed incorrect risk perception after too many\nclose calls, I blamed wanting to impress Kadin. If I could create a flowchart\nof decisions and personality traits that led me to the river that day, I would\nguarantee that it never happened again.\n\nI knew my reduced risk inhibition came from too many narrow escapes, and\nhaving a more experienced partner had created an \u201cexpert halo\u201d that tipped the\nadventure-experience scale to a dangerous imbalance. At the same time, I\nhadn\u2019t been looking to push my limits like the sensation-seeking personalities\nI kept reading about, people who needed big thrills to feel things. Those\npeople often have lower trait anxiety, which means they feel less anxious in\nday-to-day life. While I loved being outside and did seek certain types of\nadventure, I have always had high anxiety and didn\u2019t enjoy the feeling of\nfear. I\u2019d just learned to ignore it.\n\nEventually I talked to Jerry Johnson, a professor in town who researches\nbackcountry risk assessment. Nothing about my story seemed to surprise him.\n\n\u201cYou wonder how these accidents don\u2019t happen more frequently in towns like\nthis, where the bar is so high,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re responding to social cues.\nHow you perform in these sports contributes to your self-worth and value. You\nwant to be able to keep up.\u201d\n\nI nodded, slowly. He was so matter-of-fact. It wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear,\nbut it was the truth. I wasn\u2019t a thrill seeker; I was someone who wanted to\nfit in and was scared of being left behind.\n\nThe brain split was the other major element I wanted to untangle. The\ndissociative episodes were still part of my life on a near-daily basis, but\nthat winter, no one I spoke to had any idea what I was talking about.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d a counselor said over the phone. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything\nlike that.\u201d\n\nEventually, long after my initial outreach, I heard back from another\ncounselor I reached out to. Not for therapy, but for more information about\nthis split. Parker Schneider specializes in acute and complex trauma, and has\na background in adventure-based programming. They offered precise, pertinent\nfeedback about what I was describing.\n\n\u201cNear-death experiences are almost always traumatic and can be incredibly\nprofound,\u201d Schneider said. \u201c[They leave] the nervous system grappling with\nprocessing the intense emotions and sensations involved in the experience.\u201d\n\nSchneider seemed familiar with what I had been experiencing, and told me that\ndissociation can be a way for someone to get through during the near-death\nexperience (NDE), as well as a way to cope afterward while the brain works to\nintegrate the experience.\n\n\u201cAfter an NDE, dissociation might manifest as the mind alternating between\ndifferent perceptions of reality,\u201d Schneider told me. \u201cThis could involve\noscillating between a reality in which an individual survived the event and\none in which they died.\u201d\n\nBetween this measured explanation of my lapses in reality, and Johnson\u2019s quiet\nunderstanding of my need to keep up, I felt more tethered to reality. I also\nfelt like I could begin to forgive myself.\n\nIt was January, eight months after the accident, and Kadin had bailed on\nanother yoga class. I was bristling, tired of his flakiness and though I\ndidn\u2019t want to admit it, stung by the perceived rejection.\n\nI had just gotten home when a mutual friend called.\n\n\u201cMags, you\u2019re going to want to go to the hospital. It\u2019s Kadin. I thought you\u2019d\nwant to know.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t part of Kadin\u2019s primary friend group, so I wasn\u2019t included in the\ncommunications from the past few days. The only thing I knew was that he was\nin the hospital and he wasn\u2019t going to make it.\n\nI drove across town in a hysterical frenzy, racing through wing after wing\nuntil I found the right room. I grabbed his hand in the hospital bed,\ndissolving into despair and guilt. He was in front of me\u2014his curly sandy-\ncolored hair and climbers\u2019 forearms and calf tattoo\u2014but inaccessible. I sobbed\nand thanked him and apologized for not saying it enough. I said everything I\u2019d\nwanted to say since May but it was too late, he couldn\u2019t hear me.\n\nI pictured him swimming the current to my boat, releasing the spray skirt and\ngrabbing me under the arms to pull me out, the countdown clock also running\nthrough his head. How long has she been underwater?\n\nI had been inches from him, unconscious in my boat in that liminal space\nbetween life and death. And now, here he was in front of me, in between but\nalready gone. There was no current to swim and I couldn\u2019t pull him out of a\nboat and bring him to the surface. My time stretches into the future but his\nis over.\n\nThis is what he knew: he knew he saved me from drowning, that I cared about\nhim, that we were trauma bonded and that maybe I loved him for saving me. But\nI was too mired in regret and terror to tell him that when I woke up\nsuffocating in my sleep, then realized I could breathe, the panic gave way to\ngratitude for being alive.\n\nI am sorry for my choices and grateful for my second chances. I\u2019ve never gone\nback on that river and I\u2019ve never truly untangled the web of decisions that\nmade me agree to go boating that day. Maybe someday I\u2019ll be able to face it.\nUntil then, I accept that fear helps protect me and I appreciate every day for\nbeing one I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have.\n\nIt\u2019s been five years. Both of our boats still hang from hooks in my garage.\nEvery few months I clear off the cobwebs.\n\nMaggie Slepian is a full-time writer based in Montana.
