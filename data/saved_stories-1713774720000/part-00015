I\nwasn\u2019t worried though, I\u2019d already downloaded the Valley Metro app, bought a\nday pass, and should that not work, I had crisp dollar bills in my shirt\npocket ready to whip out. Anyway, nobody else seemed to be paying, so I sat\ndown content and excited, happy to be back on the road for a month, and ready\nto undermine Phoenix\u2019s stereotype as America\u2019s least walkable city.\n\nChris Arnade Walks the World is a reader-supported publication. To receive new\nposts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nThat was the high point, and within a minute it all started going south, kept\ngoing south, until I was so broken, despondent, depressed, and ill, I turned\ntail and went back home, barely batting an eye at burning a round trip ticket\nto the Philippines.\n\nA wrote a minute, but it probably was only twenty seconds before the guy\nsprawled over three seats directly across from me, who smelled of shit, piss,\nsweat, and alcohol, started yelling at me. Telling me to stop looking at him,\nto get out of his face, and asking me why the fuck I was near him. He was a\nblack guy, which I only mention because he mentioned it many times while also\npointing out I was white.\n\nI did my best to ignore him, but he refused to be ignored, so I told him\nsomething like, \u2018It\u2019s all good. I got no issue with you, we all cool,\u2019 to\nwhich he said something like, \u2018Well I got a fucking issue with you\u2019 and leaned\nin closer, and ranted some more.\n\nI causally looked around, hoping to find someone to share a look of \u2018Geez,\nwhat\u2019s up with this guy,\u2019 but everyone was smartly ignoring it all, refusing\nto look at me, him, their eyes focused on being empty and removed. So a few\nstops later, when I realized he wasn\u2019t going to drop it, whatever it was, I\nmoved a few cars away, but he kept looming, and whenever I glanced up, he was\nlocked on me.\n\nHalf an hour later I was at a bus stop, waiting with a mob for the 41 that was\ntwenty minutes late, wishing I\u2019d peed in the airport because this whole\nairport to motel adventure was taking longer than my bladder had expected.\nGiven the surrounding smell I was sure my predicament wasn\u2019t a novelty.\n\nI was still optimistic and content. Phoenix has a muscular low-slung\nminimalist beauty, especially towards sunset, when the dust that coats\neverything gives back a little, turning the sky a soft red. The crepuscular\nlights hide a lot, and like a bottom rung strip-club, Phoenix especially\nbenefits from that.\n\nWhen my bus eventually came, it was so late, so crowded, the line to get on so\nlong, the driver waived us through, so I didn\u2019t get to use the bus app or the\ndollars in my pocket, didn\u2019t get to bask in being the good student who\u2019d done\nhis homework.\n\nTen minutes later, about a mile from my motel, I was off the bus, feeling\nqueasy from the odor of weed mixed with an undetermined burning plastic smell\nthat seemed everywhere. Anyways, I was happy to walk the last few blocks and\nmaybe find a place to eat that had a bathroom.\n\nBut there were few appealing places to sit down and eat, and no place with a\nbathroom that I could slip into to pee quickly \u2014 all were locked tightly. I\nquickly understood why. I was in an open-air drug market that extended the\nsix-miles length of my bus ride, with dealers and users lining the road, their\nstalls being shopping carts piled high with boxes, bags, electronics, jugs,\nstuffed animals, mops, shovels, tents, and dirty clothes. The ground around\nthem was littered with two-inch squares of burned tin foil, empty liquor\nbottles, old panhandling signs, and piles of shit and puddles of piss.\n\nAfter crossing an overpass, its narrow passage a dystopian scene of bodies\ntwisted into collapsed shapes from drugs, I was at my hotel, behind a guarded\ngate. In front of it was the restaurant I\u2019d picked out as a fallback should I\nrun out of time, which I was, and while it looked promising, it also had a\nlarge cardboard sign on the door \u201cBathroom Out Of Order\u201d which while\ndisappointing my bloated bladder, my brain knew was a ruse to drive away the\noverpass dwellers.\n\nAfter a nice meal of pozole, I checked into my motel, and while I\u2019m used to\nthe chaos of cheap motels, which are often long-term residencies for people\nwith state vouchers, this one tested even me.\n\nThe rooms had a strong prison cell aesthetic, stripped of anything valuable,\nthat might cause harm, be broken, or carted away. A cement rectangle holding\ntwo hard beds with a single see-through thin sheet, a perfunctory cover that\nsomehow was both scratchy yet provided no warmth, pillows so thin a stack of\nfour barely registered as an adult pillow, and a decade-old TV bolted into\nplace, and that was it. No lamps, no working outlets beyond one for the TV and\nfridge, which I unplugged so I could charge my phone and computer.\n\nThen there was the smell of weed and that burning plastic, so I kept the door\nopen, to be serenaded into sleep by the whoooshing sound of the Quick Quack\nCar Wash fifty yards away. I eventually closed it when the ambulance sirens\ngot to be too much, and for safety, although its half-broken lock seemed\nentirely symbolic.\n\nThe next morning (5 a.m.) I started what I hoped would be the beginning of a\ndaily routine, walking a mile to the McDonald\u2019s to have my coffee and chill.\nBut that walk, like the walk to my motel, was a maze of broken people. Now\nmostly sleeping, but many still up and hustling. It became like one of those\nold Disney rides, where an animatronic character would pop out from behind a\nbuilding or bush, holding a bottle of vodka, or an old vacuum cleaner (why),\nor pushing a train of carts, and mumble something at me, or towards me, or\njust into the void.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s wasn\u2019t much better. A haven for the broken. There was the woman\nwho was engaged in a loud conversation with a Susan, who wasn\u2019t there. She had\nno phone, but pretended she did. She walked around the dining room, never\nstraying too far from her nest, a pile of bags and clothes near the kids\u2019\nplayhouse.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the illegal, you\u2019re the stranger in our land, Susan. Is you\u2019re\ngrotesque friend also an illegal Susan!\u201d\n\n(long pause)\n\n\u201cWith your husband behind bars you don\u2019t have citizenship, Susan. You\u2019re\ntrying to get me really hurt, Susan. Should I go to Uncle Mike\u2019s apartment\nright now and knock his door? (pause) Why is your father allowing you to treat\neveryone in the family like such pieces of crap? (pause) Huh, Susan? Huh? Why\naren\u2019t you answering me. (pause) I don\u2019t see any reason they should be lenient\nwith you, Susan.\u201d\n\nWhen she started mixing in Friends references, \u201cWell Susan, I\u2019ll tell you\nthis, I\u2019m the Rachel character and you\u2019re the smelly cat downstairs\ncharacter.\u201d I did my best not to laugh.\n\nAfter my coffee, I began my planned walk, a thirteen mile loop that would take\nme through most of Northwest Phoenix, where I\u2019d hoped to find something\ndifferent, but I didn\u2019t.\n\nSix miles later, my ability to find humor in the disarray was gone, when\ndesperate to pee, I went to an empty strip mall to add to the urine smell.\n\nThat\u2019s where I found John, wrapped in a singed blanket, his body covered in\nscars and recent burns. He was alternating between picking at scabs and\npulling smoke from a sizzling blue paste spread over a thin tin-foil bespoke\nstove.\n\nHe was smoking a \u201cperc 30,\u201d a cheap knock-off opioid pill. The legal term is\nnon-pharmaceutical fentanyl, or NPF, and they\u2019re all over Phoenix. They\u2019re why\nthe buses, and my motel room, smelled like burned plastic, since users pull\nthe smoke up through restaurant straws. It\u2019s also why my iced coffee at\nMcDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t come with a straw.\n\nJohn had (accidentally) set himself on fire a few days earlier, but didn\u2019t go\nto the hospital, and refused my offers to bring him to one. He didn\u2019t want to\nlose his prime spot, or risk having his drugs taken away, or being shuttled\ninto another rehab where he would have to play by someone else\u2019s rules.\n\nI brought him a McDonald\u2019s breakfast, although he didn\u2019t eat it. He wanted to\ntell me his life story, of his \u201ctrauma,\u201d which in his mind included having\nbeen a marine, a POW, and a sex-slave, all of which he escaped by swimming\nacross the ocean1.\n\nThe more believable parts of his bio was he\u2019d been born in California to a\nmother who cared more for her drugs than her children, followed by a decade in\nthe foster care system.\n\nJohn, like a lot of users I talked to in Phoenix, was slow. Very slow.\nProbably mentally disabled. In any functional humane society he wouldn\u2019t be on\nthe streets, smoking fake fentanyl laced pills and setting himself on fire. He\nwouldn\u2019t be telling stories of trauma, real and made up.\n\nBut that\u2019s not us. We, for whatever reason, let this crap happen. Churn out\nmillions of Johns, untethered, with no community to embrace them other than\nthe community of drugs and homelessness. We let whole parts of our cities\nbecome public shooting galleries, drug traps, and camp grounds.\n\nThe rest of the walk didn\u2019t get any better, and my mood kept getting worse.\nThe sun rose, my skin baked, and while I should have drunk lots of water, I\ndidn\u2019t, because there weren\u2019t any bathrooms around. That shouldn\u2019t have\nstopped me, because everyone else pee-ed and shit outside, turning Phoenix\ninto the world\u2019s largest litter box.\n\nThat first day\u2019s walk wasn\u2019t uniformly bad though because Phoenix does have\nnice parts.\n\nPhoenix is a large grid, of mile-long four-lane sides, with shopping plazas at\nthe corners, and an inside of twisting single-lane roads and simple ranch\nhomes on half-acre plots. Those residential insides are the nice parts, and\nshowing that they\u2019re nice is partly why I\u2019d come to Phoenix: to highlight a\nversion of the American Dream, which, while I might not love and isn\u2019t\nnecessarily \u201cwalkable,\u201d is still very appealing to lots of people. It\u2019s what I\nwrote about last week, when I cautioned that walkability doesn\u2019t necessarily\ntranslate into livibility.\n\nYet, it gets harder and harder to focus on those nice middle parts, when the\ndisorder on the edges and the nodes was so overwhelmingly intense.\n\nBy the end of the day, I was a little beaten down, tired, sunburned, and\ndehydrated, but still ok. So I went to a local bar, had a few beers, got some\ntent tacos, went to sleep, and got up to do it all over again, this time with\nthe plan of walking towards the presumably nicer downtown.\n\nThe second morning began at the same McDonald\u2019s, with the now familiar woman\nyelling at Susan \u2014 my own little Groundhog Day-like riff (\u201cOkay, campers, rise\nand shine, and don't forget your booties\u201d) which I chuckled at.\n\nBy noon I wasn\u2019t chuckling anymore. The walk, although in a different\ndirection, was just as depressing. Long empty stretches on mile-long blocks,\nwith just me and the distraught. It became another day-long lesson in the\nzoology of American dysfunction \u2014 the homeless addict, the mentally-ill\nhomeless addict, the bored and aimless teens, the elderly with no family, the\nphysically handicapped, the obese, the obese physically handicapped, the perc\n30 addict, the angry mentally ill, and so on and so on.\n\nAfter a lunch my body had no interest in, I realized I was in over my head,\nand needed to get out of the sun, needed water, so I called it quits, and\nfound a bus route to get the six miles back to my motel. The first bus was\nrunning forty-five minutes late, and the stop had no shade, so instead of\nwaiting, I walked to the second, which was an hour and fifteen late. I also\nwalked that last bit.\n\nWhen I finally got to my room, I realized I\u2019d made a massive mistake2. I had\nzero appetite, despite having eaten little all day, and I badly needed\nhydration, so I went to the corner 24 7 Convenience Store to stock up on\nGatorade, where all my cards were declined, then locked. I\u2019ve used these cards\nin Senegal, Mongolia, and Ecuador without triggering so much as a security\ntext, but the corner of 27th and Indian School Rd was too much for the\nalgorithm. Given who was around me and the amount of plexiglass between me and\nthe clerk, it was probably justified.\n\nThankfully I still had all my crisp dollar bills in my shirt pocket, because\ndespite having ridden four or five buses since landing, I\u2019d never had to use\nthem, since every fare reader was broken, or I was waved on because the bus\nwas so late and crowded.\n\nI drank about two gallons of water and Gatorade, and although only 5 p.m. I\nwent to sleep. It was a bad night. My head pounded, my body cramped, I had a\nfever, and could never get comfortable, constantly flipping between dreams and\nhallucinations. Three times people pounded on my door, which I knew was real\nbecause I checked my phone to see the time, and took screenshots like any good\njournalist does, and also to help the police catch my killer. I watch a lot of\nDateline.\n\nIt was probably more innocent though \u2014 people mistaking my room for their\ndealer\u2019s room or for the place the party was. There were a lot of parties\ngoing on, the music from them bleeding through my walls, as well as the\narguments around them. \u201cYou stole my pipe you fucking bitch!\u201d was the only\nline I remember, because for feverish reasons I was on the speakers side,\nconvinced that S had indeed stole his pipe. Which you simply don\u2019t do to\nsomeone. Not without consequences.\n\nThe next morning, desperate to force a routine, I once again trekked to the\nMcDonald\u2019s, to get my coffee and the latest anti-Susan news. I felt a little\nbetter, my headache and fever were gone, but my body still felt like an\novercooked noodle, and I ditched any plans for another walk. Anyways, I wasn\u2019t\nin the mood to see more despair.\n\nI did make it to Sunday mass, both for religious reasons but also to see a\nbetter side of Phoenix, and humanity. That did lift me a bit, to see\nfunctional families, together, with smiles on their faces, rather than\ngrimaces of pain.\n\nI spent the rest of the day in my room, only going out to get a lunch at the\nMcDonald\u2019s, and to stock up on Gatorade. This time I rode the bus rather than\nwalked, and once again, didn\u2019t get the chance to pay, since the fare readers\nwere all broken.\n\nAt night my fever returned, as did the post-midnight door pounding, and when I\nwoke up to an email reminding me of my flight to LA, which reminded me of my\nflight to Manila in four days, my heart sunk and I realized I was done. I\ndidn\u2019t want any more motel room illness days, any more feeling trapped,\nsurrounded by the unfamiliar.\n\nSo I booked a late flight home, despite my flights to LA and Manila being non-\nrefundable. Which meant two more bus rides to get to the airport, and maybe a\nchance to finally use the one day bus pass I\u2019d downloaded, or stick in to the\nfare reader two crisp bills that still sat at the ready in my shirt pocket.\n\nThat last bus finally had a working scanner, and I gleefully paid, then sat in\nfront of a young couple who spent the ride preparing a foil of perc 30s, which\nthey had the decency to wait to smoke till getting off.\n\nI wish I had something nicer to say about Phoenix, but it really sucked. I am\nsure people will point out I chose the worst part of the city to spend time\nin, but it\u2019s a large chunk of Phoenix, adjacent to and including parts of\ndowntown where lots of residents live.\n\nWhile I feel awful for the broken people on the streets, am angry at our cruel\nsociety that values freedom, independence, and self-expression so much we give\nsuch little support, guidance, and fulfilling community to those with the\nleast who need it the most, I feel worse for the residents of Phoenix who are\ntrying their best to be decent people, who don\u2019t do drugs, don\u2019t panhandle,\npay their taxes, try to pay their bus fares, play by the rules, and are hoping\nto find their tiny slice of the American Dream.\n\nThat dream still exists and the lower-income residential parts of Phoenix are\na testimony to that, including a lot of Mexican-American immigrants who have\nso much relative to what they once had, who can hope to see their children\ngrow up and do better than themselves.\n\nBut it also comes with neighborhoods now being locked down in response to the\nbedlam outside. Their bus stops pissed on, their streets littered with the\ndetritus of drugs, their bathrooms locked, with the mirrors pulled out of\nthem3.\n\nNone alone is a huge deal, but in aggregate it is depressing, bleak, and soul-\nsucking, that this downscale version of the American Dream comes with having\nto navigate around, and tolerate, an unnecessary tumult.\n\nHaving to navigate a Disney-like ride of human animatronics \u2014 empty of purpose\nor meaning, powered by drugs, and filled with despair.\n\nI would like to say we are a better country than this. Richer, more\nempathetic, and less selfish, but I\u2019m not so sure anymore. There is a profound\nemptiness in large parts of the US \u2014 a purposelessness, hopelessness, and\nspiritual vacuum, being filled by an addiction to the momentary relief,\nfleeting felicity, and the dulling numbness of weed, booze, and perc 30s.\n\nA loneliness of the soul being tempered by a growing community of drugs, that\nwell-to-do Americans have decided to ignore, presumably to let it play out in\nthe \u201crougher\u201d parts of town.\n\nThat\u2019s a mistake, and it\u2019s not fair to anyone involved. Not to the empty and\nbroken, who are being allowed to slowly kill themselves one pill after the\nnext, and certainly not to the residents of those neighborhoods, who shouldn\u2019t\nhave to be the only witness to it all.\n\nPS: When I got home, I booked a less stressful trip to walk the Netherlands\nand Belgium. I leave next Thursday, and plan to walk from Amsterdam to\nBrussels, via Rotterdam and other places.\n\nI need a break from the bleak, and these long walks through industrial Europe\nare my favorite.\n\n\u2018Til next week!\n\n1\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating to listen to street users, especially those towards the\nbottom of the mental capacity range, regurgitate Mickey Mouse versions of\nmodern therapy talk, which is centered with the idea of trauma. It\u2019s become a\nvery modern way for them to justify their behavior. It\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s my\npast trauma speaking!\n\nThat they end up inventing trauma, when they already have plenty of real\nproblems, shows how a lot of group therapy has now turned into an arms race of\nbad stuff.\n\n2\n\nThe walks were made more strenuous because I carried my backpack, since I\ndidn\u2019t want to leave any valuables in my motel room. LOL.\n\n3\n\nIt became a running bit to try and find a McDonald\u2019s bathroom with a mirror. I\nnever found one. They take them out because people either break them (for\nlaughs), or scratch tag them, or spend so much time cleaning up in front of\nthem (washing hair in sink, etc), that they\u2019ve pulled them out altogether.\n\n### Subscribe to Chris Arnade Walks the World\n\nHundreds of paid subscribers\n\nDispatches and photos from walks around the world\n\n315 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n43 Restacks\n\n315\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Walking Phoenix\n\nwalkingtheworld.substack.com\n\n121\n\nShare\n\n121 Comments\n\nChris ArnadeMar 14\u00b7edited Mar 14AuthorWell, this post was finally found by\nreddit and I've had to close the comments to only paying subscribers.I don't\nreally want to address their issues, because I'll let the piece speak for\nitself.But the idea I unfairly targeted Phoenix by choosing the worst part of\ntown entirely misses what I do. I don't ever stay in the touristy parts of\ntown. I don't use cabs or cars. I walk and use public transportation, and I\nstay at the lowest cost motels I can find.The part of Phoenix I stayed in, and\nwalked, is a large part of Phoenix. It's not some weird anomaly. Just like the\nSouth Bronx is very much NYC, as is East LA, or Central Cleveland, or\nNorthside Milwaukee, all of which I've stayed in.Expand full commentLike\n(13)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\nChris TharpMar 3AuthorI knew you'd probay hate it.
