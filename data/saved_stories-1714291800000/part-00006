Reader discretion is strongly advised.\n\nThe man who ushered in the widespread acceptance of the hardcore porn genre,\nMax Hardcore, passed away on Monday, March 27. He was 66 years old. Max, the\nself-proclaimed founder of \u201cthroat f***ing\u201d and other sex acts in porn many\nwould consider criminal, whose real name was Paul F. Little (also known as\nPaul Steiner), profoundly shaped the landscape of pornography.\n\nMax had a career that spanned several decades and was a porn industry AVN Hall\nof Fame director and performer who was largely responsible for popularizing\nabusive, violent porn. He was exposed in Exodus Cry\u2019s documentary series\nBeyond Fantasy, the last episode of which was released just days before his\ndeath. The series uncovers violation, coercion, and abuse in the porn\nindustry.\n\nPorn producer Eric Swiss shared in Beyond Fantasy, \u201cBefore Max, pornography\nwas a very tame thing. All pornographers, whether they accept it or not, owe a\nlarge part of their craft to what he developed... As pornographers, we stand\non the shoulders of the genius of Max Hardcore for what he created.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenius\u201d is not the word that comes to mind when we think of Max Hardcore.\n\u201cCriminal,\u201d feels much more appropriate. Exodus Cry carries the conviction\nthat many of the sex acts depicted in Max\u2019s videos were acts of sexual assault\nthat would warrant prosecution.\n\n## Who Was Max Hardcore?\n\nMax was seemingly an average joe; a middle-aged man with a twangy, Midwestern\naccent, who liked race cars and rock \u2018n roll. In an interview for Beyond\nFantasy, he states that he \u201cgrew up in a very healthy and nurturing\nenvironment. No traumatic events. Parents were together until they died... The\nworst thing I can remember is getting beat up by a bully.\u201d\n\nHe grew up in Wisconsin and began making the move to amateur pornography\ncreation in the early 1990s. Max rose to prominence in 1992 with the release\nof the film series, \u201cThe Anal Adventures of Max Hardcore\u201d and became known for\nthe cowboy hat he wore in every scene. In total, he created more than 500\npornographic films across his career.\n\nInspired by pornographer John Stagliano, who became famous for pioneering the\ngonzo porn genre, Hardcore\u2019s films have depicted young women, appearing to be\nunderage, being urinated on, slapped, choked, fisted, and vomiting as they\nwere gagged by his penis or other objects.\n\nWhat we discovered through our investigation of the porn industry, and our\nsubsequent interviews and investigation into Max, is that he is a man with a\ndeeply sociopathic desire to destroy women. As controversial as his content\nwas, the porn industry acted as a welcoming outlet for his sadistic, violent,\nand deeply abusive cravings to be satisfied.\n\nHis motto was, \u201cWe\u2019re not happy until you\u2019re not happy.\u201d And he truly lived by\nthat. In his interview for Beyond Fantasy, he told Director Benjamin Nolot,\n\u201cIf you stay cooperative through the whole scene, then we haven\u2019t pushed you\nhard enough... I want you to tell me to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI push to the maximum, to the absolute limit, and some women I have pushed\nover the limit...When you\u2019re pushing hard, people are going to suffer, for\nsure. It\u2019s a great experience to find out what the breaking point of a person\nis. In my films, I push to the maximum to see how much stuff she can take\nuntil she stops and can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d\n\n## Max\u2019s Film-Making Methods and Philosophy\n\nFor many porn producers and consumers, Max is viewed as an icon and a hero. To\nothers, he was the worst kind of predator. Max refers to the women in his\nscenes as \u201cvictims\u201d and they all refer to him as \u201cMister.\u201d He was a man marked\nby violence who frequently took on roles of power, preying on the vulnerable.\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to look at his scenes and see that they are a form of\npseudo-pedophilia. He dressed up the women\u2014often girls who were brand new to\nthe industry\u2014as little girls in schoolgirl skirts, ankle socks, pink ribbons,\nand pigtails. They skip into their scenes and Max pursues them, abducts them,\ntortures them, and more or less rapes them.\n\n> His motto was, \u201cWe\u2019re not happy until you\u2019re not happy.\u201d\n\nUsing the term rape can be tricky when referring to the porn industry. Actual\ndepiction of rape may result in an obscenity trial and a prison term for the\npornographer. So porn producers, like Max, get around the rape issue by\nensuring that at some point they obtained some form of consent. However, as we\nuncover in Beyond Fantasy, performers are not given the full picture of what\nwill be asked of them in many scenes. They are given as little information as\npossible. In fact, they are often coerced or defrauded into giving some form\nof consent.\n\nA typical Max Hardcore scene, by all intents and purposes, looks like rape. A\ngirl is pursued and captured. She cringes and cowers; Max yanks her by her\nhair and slaps her around. But the porn industry and Max himself tell us it is\nnot rape, because he has obtained \u201cconsent.\u201d Images battle with words. Turn\nthe sound down, and it is a rape.\n\nRELATED: These Performers are Exposing Violent Abuse on Porn Sets\n\nMax Hardcore defined his films as \u201cinstructional videos\u201d on how to get a young\ngirl to do whatever you want. These videos center on inflicting pain and\nhumiliation on girls who appear to be underage, even pre-pubescent in some\ncases. He told the Sick & Wrong Podcast, \u201cWe\u2019d use tiny little girls, maybe 80\nor 90 pounds. If you see a girl who looks like she\u2019s 14 years old and she\u2019s\ntakin\u2019 it up the ass and havin\u2019 a good time, that\u2019s great!\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIn real life, you\u2019re not gonna meet a 12-year-old girl on the\nstreet and be f*ckin\u2019 her in a filthy bathroom at the public park. But it can\nhappen with the magic of cinema! When people saw Barbie Angel, Little\nCinderella, Catalina, Chloe Adams, et cetera, et cetera, they thought the\ngirls were underage, when in fact, of course, they were not.\u201d\n\nSome journalists have described Hardcore\u2019s work as male revenge, intended not\nfor arousal but rather the complete degradation and breaking of women through\nintolerable cruelty and aggressive, determined brutality.\n\nDavid Foster Wallace, author of \u201cBig Red Son,\u201d wrote, \u201cGood old Max Hardcore,\nfor instance, is a total psychopath\u2014that\u2019s part of his on-screen Gonzo\npersona\u2014but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner.\u201d\n\nEven in his interview for Beyond Fantasy, Max did not conceal his sadistic\nimpulses: \u201cI completely f*cking dominate them and push them down, hold them,\nput their arms behind their back, pull their hair, spank \u2018em and slap \u2018em\nuntil you finally break \u2018em down and leave \u2018em in a heap on the floor. And\nsometimes they break completely and start crying.\u201d\n\n### Coercive Tactics\n\nIn 2000, Max allowed a British documentary crew to film behind the scenes of a\nshoot with Felicity, a new performer. What they captured was incredibly heart-\nwrenching and sickening. She quickly stops the scene in distress, \u201cThe things\nyou\u2019re doing to my body and stuff, it\u2019s abusive.\u201d She sobs, \u201cI am not\ncomfortable with it. I hate it... I can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s horrible and I hate it\nand I want to go home.\u201d\n\nMax responds, \u201cYou got responsibilities and people who have responsibilities\nthat are important, they do it, they do their job. They take care of\nbusiness.\u201d\n\nWhen she still insists that she doesn\u2019t want to partake in the scene anymore,\nMax gets cruel stating, \u201cYou think the scene is disgusting? You disgust me.\nYou\u2019re a f*cking loser.\u201d\n\nWhen director Benjamin Nolot questions Max about this particular scene and why\nhe pursued Felicity after she left the scene, Max smiles and laughs. \u201cYou can\nlook at that as pressure and trying to coerce her into doing the scene but I\nlook at it as encouragement.\u201d\n\nMax eventually pressured Felicity into continuing with the scene but the\ndocumentary crew intervened and she left.\n\nA former porn performer by the name of Julie Meadows said this about working\nwith Max:\n\n\u201cMax was the low point of my career... Also, when I asked over the phone what\nkind of sex it would be, I was told boy/girl sex. I wasn\u2019t told that it would\nbe about implied pedophilia. I wasn\u2019t told that there might be incest-related\ndialogue. I wasn\u2019t told a speculum would be involved or extreme face-f*cking.\n\nAs he explained the scene, two large men stood behind my seat in his tiny\noffice. If I imagine what another female could possibly feel like in that\nsituation, but with her car blocks away from her and no idea where she is\nbecause she was driven to the location and not given the address, I can\nimagine she\u2019d feel even more vulnerable than I did, and I still felt very\nvulnerable in the situation.\u201d\n\n> I was crying to the point where I\u2019m looking at the cameraman waiting for\n> somebody to stop it. But I\u2019m like if I stop now, I\u2019m not going to get paid.\n\nIn a podcast interview with Holly Randall, Briana Banks, a veteran porn star\nwith more than 20 years in the porn industry, describes a traumatizing 6-hour\nlong scene she did with Max Hardcore during which he used personal information\nagainst her. Upon meeting, Max was kind and personable, inquiring about her\nfamily and personal life. However, he later used that information against her\nin the scene to further break her.\n\nOnce the scene began, Max turned into somebody very different. Banks said, \u201cI\nwas crying to the point where I\u2019m looking at the cameraman waiting for\nsomebody to stop it. But I\u2019m like if I stop now, I\u2019m not going to get paid.\nAll this stuff is going through my head, like how much longer can this really\ngo on for? And this is only 2 hours into it...[Max] didn\u2019t drug me but I wish\nI had been drugged for that scene.\u201d\n\n## Max Hardcore\u2019s Criminal History\n\nMax Hardcore faced several charges during his time in the porn industry.\nUnfortunately, true justice never seemed to be achieved other than a short\nstint in jail. He was indicted on five counts of transporting obscene matter\nby use of an interactive computer service and five counts of mailing obscene\nmatter. The indictment alleged that through MaxWorld, Max distributed films\nthat met the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s standards of obscenity, through the U.S.\nmail, to an address located in the Middle District of Florida.\n\nIn June of 2008, Max was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 46\nmonths in prison. His websites were confiscated by the government, and he was\nfined a total of $87,500.\n\n### Distribution of Child Sexual Abuse Material\n\nIn 1998, just 6 years after Max\u2019s first breakout film, he was charged by the\ncity of Los Angeles with child pornography and the distribution of obscenity.\nIn his film Max Extreme 4, an actress who was over age 18 was portrayed as an\nunderage character.\n\nRELATED: Why is the Fictional Depiction of Child Porn Legal in the US?\n\nHowever, in 2002, just before this case was finally brought to trial, the U.S.\nSupreme Court determined, in the infamous Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition\ncase, that the statute prohibiting adults from portraying an underage\ncharacter was unconstitutional. Based on this ruling, the child pornography\ncharges against Max Hardcore were dismissed. The misdemeanor charge of\ndistribution of obscenity was retained, but a jury failed to reach a verdict.\n\nIn our interview with Max in Beyond Fantasy, \u201cBarely Legal,\u201d Max admits, \u201cI\ncostume the girls to look like this emerging teen. It\u2019s an indeterminate age\nbetween twelve and twenty.\u201d\n\n### Hicks v. Max Hardcore\n\nOn May 7, 2014, adult film performer Alaina Hicks (stage name Bonnie Rotten)\nsued Hardcore and two of his companies, Film West Production and\nMaxhardcoretv.com, claiming that video stills and a scene she shot with him,\nwhen she was only 19, were made available to the public without her consent.\n\nTwo months later, Hardcore filed a retaliatory suit against Hicks, claiming\nthat she was attempting to repudiate a 2012 agreement giving him permission to\nuse her performance in F*** Puppets 2, which he acted in and produced. He\nclaimed that Hicks received \u201ca substantial benefit\u201d from appearing in the\nfilm.\n\nThe case was eventually dismissed and the terms and details of the\nstipulation/agreement were not made public.\n\nIn an interview on the TT Boy TV podcast, hosted by fellow pornographic\nperformer Phillip Troy Rivera, Hardcore recounted the story of an actress he\nreferred to as \u201cOlivia,\u201d (we can surmise he is referring to Hicks) who planned\nto sue him over an appearance in one of his films. He said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t like\nthe way she was portrayed. I\u2019m throat-f***ing her and she\u2019s vomiting. So she\nwas gonna sue me. I write her a check, I think it was for fifteen thousand,\nand the problem goes away. A check . . . it\u2019s a disappearing device.\u201d\n\n## Max Hardcore Leaves Behind a Legacy of Abuse, Trauma and Coercion\n\nSince Max\u2019s recent death, droves of men, both participants in porn and\npurveyors of it, took to social media to celebrate his life and contribution\nto the porn industry. But one look at Max\u2019s legacy, and we can\u2019t help but\nwonder what it is that they are celebrating... the humiliation, degradation\nand horrific abuse of women? The coercion? The pedophilic themes in his\nvideos?\n\nTo celebrate Max Hardcore\u2019s legacy is to celebrate the hatred of women, rape\nand sexual assault. Instead, we ought to mourn the hundreds, if not thousands\nof women abused by this man throughout his career in porn.\n\nWe spent a good deal of time examining Max\u2019s influence on the porn industry in\nour third episode of Beyond Fantasy, \u201cHardcore.\u201d You can watch the whole\nseries for free on YouTube. In addition to interviews with porn industry\nprofessionals, the series includes graphic descriptions of what happens on\nporn sets, short clips from porn scenes (we\u2019ve blurred all nudity), and it\ncomes with a strong trigger warning.\n\nThis episode in the series boldly exposes violent abuse porn, content which is\ncreeping onto screens in virtually every household with an internet\nconnection. Yes, this is a disturbing subject. But until we as a society see\nit for what it is and call out the blatant injustice, the abuse will continue.\n\nExodus Cry has been actively working with women who have been assaulted or\nsexually exploited in the creation of pornography, including victims of Max\nHardcore. Despite the fact that these women have essentially been through hell\nand back, they are finding healing and building beautiful new lives. Thanks to\nthe generosity of amazing partners, we have been able to provide survivors\nwith life-changing, specialized trauma-informed therapy from some of the\nnation\u2019s top trauma therapists.\n\nYou can help play an important part in bringing restoration and new life to\nvictims of sexual exploitation and abusive porn by donating here.\n\nFeatured post\n\n##### More posts by Madison McQueen & Olivia Burnett\n\nHow Porn and Trafficking Are Undeniably Connected When people think of\ntrafficking, they generally don\u2019t think of pornography.
