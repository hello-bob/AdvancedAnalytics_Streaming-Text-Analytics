The leaked materials allow us to cross-\nexamine past research findings ; explore threat actors\u2019 tactics, techniques\nand procedures (TTPs); and probe the motivations and intents of Chinese threat\nactors. The Natto Team has found one aspect of i-SOON leaked documents that\nhas not been discussed much. This is \u201cTZ\u201d, two letters in the Latin alphabet,\nlikely an acronym. It appears more than 80 times across the over 570 leaked\ndocuments, including chat logs, product marketing white papers, compromised\ndata samples, screenshots and images. What does TZ stand for? Interestingly,\nno explanation can be found through the documents. Even i-SOON\u2019s product\nmarketing whitepaper, Integrated Combat Platform (\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u4f5c\u6218\u5e73\u53f0), mentioned TZ 17\ntimes, but it did not explain what TZ stood for or meant. It sounds as if TZ\nwas a code name for something. Well, maybe it is time for us to decode the\nmeaning of mysterious TZ.\n\nWhat is TZ? Source: Natto Thoughts\n\n#\n\nFrom What We Knew\n\ni-SOON leaks displayed quite a few two-letter acronyms in various chat logs,\ncontracts, and product marketing papers. Some of them were known Chinese\nacronyms used in chat rooms or forums when users would like to be discreet and\navoid censorship while discussing sensitive topics. These two-letter acronyms\nwere often the initial letters of Chinese characters that had been written out\nin Pinyin, the standard system of romanized spelling for transliterating\nChinese. For example:\n\n  * AQ - in Pinyin: \u0101n qu\u0101n; in Chinese: \u5b89\u5168; in English: security; in the context of the leak it refers to offices of the Ministry of State Security.\n\n  * GA \u2013 in Pinyin: g\u014dng \u0101n; in Chinese: \u516c\u5b89; in English: public security; in the context of the leak it refers to offices of the Ministry of Public Security.\n\n  * QB \u2013 in Pinyin: q\u00edn b\u00e0o; in Chinese: \u60c5\u62a5; in English: intelligence.\n\n  * ZC \u2013 in Pinyin: zh\u0113n ch\u00e1; in Chinese: \u4fa6\u67e5; in English: detect; investigate; or scouting; or in Chinese \u4fa6\u5bdf; in English: reconnaissance, or scouting.\n\n  * JG \u2013 in Pinyin: j\u016bn g\u014dng; in Chinese: \u519b\u5de5; in English: military industry.\n\n  * JK \u2013 in Pinyin: ji\u0101n k\u00f2ng; in Chinese: \u76d1\u63a7; in English: surveillance or monitoring.\n\nFrom the above acronyms, we believe TZ stands for a phrase consisting of two\nChinese characters whose Pinyin initials are \u201cT\u201d and \u201cZ.\u201d Checking the Chinese\ndictionary and sorting through hundreds of two-Chinese-character phrases with\nPinyin initials \u201cTZ\u201d, the following are phrases the Natto Team believed may be\nrelevant to the context:\n\n  * t\u00f3u zi, \u6295\u8d44, investment\n\n  * t\u00e8 zh\u0113, \u7279\u4fa6, short for \u7279\u6b8a\u4fa6\u67e5(\u4fa6\u5bdf), special investigation, or special reconnaissance\n\n  * t\u00e8 zh\u00f4ng, \u7279\u79cd, special (military)\n\n  * t\u00e0n zh\u0113, \u63a2\u9488, probe, detector\n\n  * t\u00f4ng zh\u00e0n, \u7edf\u6218, unification\n\n  * t\u00f4ng zh\u00ec, \u7edf\u6cbb, rule\n\n  * ti\u00e2o zh\u00e0n: \u6311\u6218, challenge\n\n  * t\u00ee zh: \u4f53\u5236, system\n\n  * t\u00fb zi: \u5154\u5b50, rabbit\n\n  * t\u00f3ng zh\u00ec: \u540c\u5fd7, comrade\n\n  * t\u00eee zi: \u5e16\u5b50, post\n\n  * t\u012b zi: \u68af\u5b50, ladder\n\nAdding to the complexity, it appears TZ can also be an acronym for an English\nphrase as well. On February 20, 2024 (see below), two days after the i-SOON\nleak, a user on HiNative, a Quora-like global language Q&A platform based in\nJapan, asked a question in Chinese: what does \u201cnetwork TZ business\u201d mean?\u201d. It\nis likely this user was reading the same documents as we were. In this case,\ninquisitive minds think alike.\n\n\u201cWhat does \u201cnetwork TZ business\u201d mean?\u201d Source:\nhttps://zh.hinative.com/questions/25502968\n\nOne responder suggested it means \u201ctime zone\u201d in English and provided examples:\n\u201c\u7f51\u7edcTZ\u4e1a\u52a1 (w\u01cenglu\u00f2 TZ y\u00e8w\u00f9) refers to online time zone services.\u201d ... \u201cFor\nexample \u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3,\u7f51\u7edcTZ\u4e1a\u52a1\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002(Z\u00e0i zh\u00e8ge qu\u00e1nqi\u00fahu\u00e0 de sh\u00edd\u00e0i, w\u01cenglu\u00f2 TZ\ny\u00e8w\u00f9 bi\u00e0n d\u00e9 yu\u00e8 l\u00e1i yu\u00e8 zh\u00f2ngy\u00e0o.) (Pinyin transliteration). In this\nglobalized era, online time zone services are becoming increasingly\nimportant.\u201d (English translation).\n\nTZ as TimeZone sounds like a plausible suggestion, but we have quite a few\nother alternatives to choose from too. The difficult part is which one is the\nanswer.\n\nShare\n\n#\n\nTZ Used in the i-SOON Leaks\n\nThe Natto Team started by looking into the context when TZ appeared in phrases\nin the i-SOON leaked documents. Here are TZ phrases we discovered:\n\n  * TZ\u4e1a\u52a1: TZ business\n\n  * TZ\u5b9e\u6218\u4e1a\u52a1: TZ live combat business\n\n  * TZ \u5de5\u4f5c: TZ work\n\n  * TZ\u5e73\u53f0: TZ platform\n\n  * TZ \u6b66\u5668\u88c5\u5907: TZ weapon and equipment\n\n  * TZ\u961f\u4f0d: TZ team\n\n  * TZ\u4efb\u52a1: TZ task\n\n  * TZ\u5e02\u573a:TZ market\n\n  * TZ \u9500\u552e\u961f\u4f0d: TZ sales team\n\n  * TZ\u6307\u5bfc\u5904\u5904\u957f: chief of TZ Guidance Office\n\n  * \u56fd\u5bb6TZ\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d: positioning of the State TZ\n\n  * TZ\u7c7b\u7684\u516c\u53f8: TZ type companies\n\n  * TZ\u961f\u957f; TZ\u526f\u5927\u961f\u957f: TZ captain; TZ vice-captain\n\n  * TZ\u4e00\u7ebf\u7684\u4eba: TZ frontline people\n\n  * TZ\u57f9\u8bad: TZ training\n\n  * TZ \u6295\u8d44: TZ investment\n\n  * TZ\u7684\u9ec4\u57d4\u519b\u6821: TZ\u2019s Whampoa Military Academy (note: the Whampoa Military Academy is the first military academy established by Sun Yat-sen, the first provisional president of the Republic of China. https://thechinaproject.com/2021/06/16/the-profound-legacy-of-chinas-whampoa-military-academy/)\n\n  * TZ\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57f9\u8bad: TZ field training\n\n  * TZ\u5efa\u8bbe: TZ building\n\n  * \u7f51\u5b89TZ: network security TZ\n\n  * \u7f51\u7edcTZ\u961f\u4f0d: network TZ team\n\n  * TZ\u884c\u4e1a: TZ industry\n\n  * TZ\u670d\u52a1\u80fd\u529b: TZ service capability\n\n  * TZ\u603b\u961f: TZ unit/brigade\n\n  * TZ\u6bd4\u6b66: TZ competition\n\n  * TZ\u80fd\u529b: TZ capability\n\n  * TZ\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4: TZ lab\n\nAs previously mentioned, i-SOON\u2019s Integrated Combat Platform product marketing\nwhite paper used the acronym TZ intensively. In the Preface section of the\nwhite paper, it stated:\n\n> \u201cIn recent years, along with the continuous development and building of\n> network TZ teams and TZ laboratories nationwide, network TZ teams of the\n> public security bureaus at all levels have reached a high level in terms of\n> both technical personnel talent reserve and tools and equipment development.\n> Specialized network TZ laboratory teams have achieved good results in\n> combating various types of online criminal activities and obtaining key\n> clues and intelligence to protect national security.

The platform can\n> scientifically manage the mechanism for the use of TZ weapons and equipment\n> and improve the norms of task flow.\u201d (Translated using DeepL.com (free\n> version) with Natto Team edits)\n\nThis is a long description of TZ but does not say what TZ is. However, from\nthe description, it appears that Chinese public security bureaus at all levels\nhave TZ teams and do TZ work.\n\nLooking into Chinese-language sources on the organizational structure of the\npublic security bureaus and drawing on the Natto Team\u2019s previous i-SOON\nresearch, we came across an obscure biographical profile on Baidu Baike, a\nChinese version of Wikipedia, that listed the person\u2019s workplace as \u201cPolitical\nCommissar of the Network (Cyber) Special Investigation (Reconnaissance) Unit\nof the Cyber Security and Defense office of the Public Security Department of\nJiangxi Province.\u201d This clue suggested that the Cyber Security and Defense\nBureau of the Ministry of Public Security (\u516c\u5b89\u90e8\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u536b\u5c40) \u2013 for which i-SOON was\none of the original certified suppliers \u2013 has a unit (\u652f\u961f) called \u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u4fa6\u652f\u961f (w\u00e2ng\nlu\u00f2 t\u00e8 zh\u0113n zh\u012b du\u00ec) \u2013 Network (Cyber) Special Investigation (Reconnaissance)\nUnit. This could be shortened to Network TZ Unit. Aha, TZ in this case likely\nstands for special investigation or special reconnaissance. To further confirm\nthis finding, the Natto Team went back to the Integrated Combat Platform\nmarketing paper again and discovered that on at least one occasion the\nmarketing paper used the phrase \u201c\u7279\u4fa6\u961f\u4f0d\u201d - special investigation/special\nreconnaissance team - without using the TZ acronym. This was in the part where\nit said the platform \u201ccan facilitate technicians of the special\ninvestigation/reconnaissance team to carry out collaborative and synthetic\noperations. The team can share techniques, tools and equipment and results,\ngiving full play to the advantages of collective combat.\u201d\n\nNote: in Chinese \u7279\u4fa6 , t\u00e8 zh\u0113n (TZ) is short for either \u7279\u6b8a(\u79cd)\u4fa6\u67e5 (t\u00e8 sh\u016b (zh\u00f4ng)\nzh\u0113n ch\u00e1 ) meaning special investigation or \u7279\u6b8a(\u79cd)\u4fa6\u5bdf (t\u00e8 sh\u016b (zh\u00f4ng) zh\u0113n ch\u00e1 )\nmeaning special reconnaissance. \u4fa6\u67e5zh\u0113n ch\u00e1 and \u4fa6\u5bdfzh\u0113n ch\u00e1 have the same Pinyin\nbut the second Chinese character is different, so \u4fa6\u67e5and \u4fa6\u5bdf have a slight\ndifference in meanings. Reading between the lines of i-SOON documents, TZ can\nmean either of these two phrases according to the context. \u201cSpecial\u201d likely\nrefers to investigations or reconnaissance activities carried out covertly\nand/or by the public security or state security bureaus.\n\n#\n\nWhen TZ Means Special Investigation/Reconnaissance of Networks\n\nTo expand our understanding of what a special network investigation or\nreconnaissance team, lab, task, competition, capability, training, or business\nentails the Natto Team re-examined the context of i-SOON documents when TZ was\nmentioned and conducted further research in Chinese procurement websites,\nvarious official government websites and Chinese search engine. We discovered\nit appears that building the capability of special network investigation and\nreconnaissance has been a priority in various levels \u2013 national, provincial,\nand local \u2013 of Chinese public security bureaus. The investment on this effort\nappears significant, judging from government procurement orders for special\nnetwork investigation/reconnaissance products and services. Companies like\ni-SOON that offer such products and services have seen a huge business\nopportunity in this area.\n\nFor example, in September 2020, the Cyber Security and Defense Department of\nChongqing Municipality Public Security Bureau requested a bid \u201cProcurement of\nTZ Platform Upgrade and Supporting Hardware.\u201d (see screenshot below). The\nbudget for the procurement order was 1.82 million RMB (around US$267K).\n\n\u201cCompetitive Negotiation Announcement for Procurement of TZ Platform Upgrade\nand Supporting Hardware (19B0202) for the Cyber Security and Defense\nDepartment of Chongqing Municipality Public Security Bureau,\u201d from the Chinese\nprocurement platform bidcenter posted on September 16, 2020. Source:\nwww.bidcenter.com\n\nIn the leaked i-SOON communications, when i-SOON\u2019s CEO Wu Haibo, aka shutdown\nor shutd0wn, discussed the company\u2019s business direction, he emphasized\nrepeatedly the importance of TZ products to the company\u2019s revenue. In one chat\nconversation with the company chief operations officer, lengmo, shutdown\nstated that the market and the clients had a huge demand for network\ninvestigation/reconnaissance products and requested lengmo to develop a\nstrategy to improve the scalability of the company\u2019s current products. Not\nonly provincial level public security clients but also county level and\ntownship level needed the products, shutdown said. The chat conversations also\nmentioned that several competitors were developing products and services\nrelated to network investigation/reconnaissance and that i-SOON worked with\nindustry partners to sell the products and services as well. In addition,\ni-SOON\u2019s business had benefited from offering network\ninvestigation/reconnaissance training programs to the public security bureaus.\n\nPivoting on this clue, the Natto Team searched sources such as Sogou, a\nChinese search engine for training programs similar to the ones i-SOON\noffered. Such programs seemed to be in high demand. For example, the Public\nSecurity Bureau in Hubei province had a province-wide \u201cSpecial Network\nInvestigation/Reconnaissance Professional Work Training\u201d course for officers\nwho worked for the Cyber Security and Defense offices at various levels (see\nscreenshot below).\n\n\u201d2018 Provincial Special Network Investigation/Reconnaissance Professional\nWork Training Course Begins at Our Academy \u2013 Hubei Police Academy.\u201d Posted on\nHubei Police Academy on July 23, 2018. Source:\nhxxps://www.hbpa.edu[.]cn/info/1174/23201.htm\n\nWell, why is network reconnaissance so special? Probably every CTI analyst can\neasily give the answer based on the Cyber Kill Chain, the framework outlining\nthe steps in any cyber threat operation. In any such campaign, reconnaissance\nis the first step: to gather information on the target, identify weak points\nof the targeted system and set up an effective attack plan. i-SOON knew it,\nand so did the Chinese public security bureaus. Network reconnaissance can\nalso be used defensively, as in penetration testing, to identify the\nvulnerabilities of a system one is protecting. For its part, network\ninvestigation usually refers to forensics for incident response and for law\nenforcement to investigate criminal incidents. Network reconnaissance and\ninvestigation are both relevant to the work of public security bureaus.\n\nTo conclude, The Natto Team replaced \u201cTZ\u201d with \u201creconnaissance\u201d in the\nfollowing paragraphs from the preface section of i-SOON\u2019s Integrated Combat\nPlatform marketing paper that previously mentioned. Does this all make sense\nnow?\n\n> \u201cIn recent years, along with the continuous development and building of\n> network reconnaissance teams and reconnaissance laboratories nationwide,\n> network reconnaissance teams of the public security bureaus at all levels\n> have reached a high level in terms of both technical personnel talent\n> reserve and tools and equipment development.
