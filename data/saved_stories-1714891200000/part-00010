He grabbed the radio to warn the pilot, his older brother Dick\nRutan. But Dick never heard the message.\n\nNine days and three minutes later, Dick, along with copilot Jeana Yeager,\ncompleted one of the greatest milestones in aviation history: the first round-\nthe-world flight with no stops or refueling.\n\nA decorated Vietnam War pilot, Dick Rutan died Friday evening at a hospital in\nCoeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, with Burt and other loved ones by his side. He was 85.\nHis friend Bill Whittle said he died on his own terms when he decided against\nenduring a second night on oxygen after suffering a severe lung infection.\n\n\u201cHe played an airplane like someone plays a grand piano,\u201d said Burt Rutan of\nhis brother, who was often described as has having a velvet arm because of his\nsmooth flying style.\n\nBurt Rutan said he had always loved designing airplanes and became fascinated\nwith the idea of a craft that could go clear around the world. His brother was\nequally passionate about flying. The project took six years.\n\nThere was plenty to worry Burt during testing of the light graphite plane,\nVoyager. There were mechanical failures, any one of which would have been\ndisastrous over a distant ocean. When fully laden, the plane couldn't handle\nturbulence. And then there was the question of how the pilots could endure\nsuch a long flight on so little sleep. But Burt said his brother had an\noptimism about him that made them all believe.\n\n\u201cDick never doubted whether my design would actually make it around, with\nstill some gas in the tank,\u201d Burt Rutan said.\n\nVoyager left from Edwards Air Force Base in California just after 8 a.m. on\nDec. 14, 1986. Rutan said with all that fuel, the wings had only inches of\nclearance. Dick couldn't see when they started dragging on the runway. But at\nthe moment Burt called on the radio, copilot Yeager gave a speed report,\ndrowning out the message.\n\n\u201cAnd then, the velvet arm really came in,\u201d Burt Rutan said. \u201cAnd he very\nslowly brought the stick back and the wings bent way up, some 30 feet at the\nwingtips, and it lifted off very smoothly.\u201d\n\nThey arrived back to a hero's welcome as thousands gathered to witness the\nlanding. Both Rutan brothers and Yeager were each awarded a Presidential\nCitizens Medal by President Ronald Reagan, who described how a local official\nin Thailand at first \u201crefused to believe some cockamamie story\" about a plane\nflying around the world on a single tank of gas.\n\n\u201cWe had the freedom to pursue a dream, and that\u2019s important,\" Dick Rutan said\nat the ceremony. \u201cAnd we should never forget, and those that guard our\nfreedoms, that we should hang on to them very tenaciously and be very careful\nabout some do-gooder that thinks that our safety is more important than our\nfreedom. Because freedom is awful difficult to obtain, and it\u2019s even more\ndifficult to regain it once it\u2019s lost.\u201d\n\nRichard Glenn Rutan was born in Loma Linda, California. He joined the U.S. Air\nForce as a teenager and flew more than 300 combat missions during the Vietnam\nWar.\n\nHe was part of an elite group that would loiter over enemy anti-aircraft\npositions for hours at a time. The missions had the call sign \u201cMisty,\" and\nDick was known as \u201cMisty Four-Zero.\u201d Among the many awards Dick received were\nthe Silver Star and the Purple Heart.\n\nHe survived having to eject twice from planes, once when his F-100 Super Sabre\nwas hit by enemy fire over Vietnam, and a second time when he was stationed in\nEngland and the same type of plane had a mechanical failure. He retired from\nthe Air Force with the rank of lieutenant colonel and went on to work as a\ntest pilot.\n\nBurt Rutan said his brother was always having adventures, like the time he got\nstranded at the North Pole for a couple of days when the Russian biplane he\nwas in landed and then sank through the ice.\n\nDick Rutan set another record in 2005 when he flew about 10 miles (16\nkilometers) in a rocket-powered plane launched from the ground in Mojave,\nCalifornia. It was also the first time U.S. mail had been carried by such a\nplane.\n\nGreg Morris, the president of Scaled Composites, a company founded by Burt\nRutan, said he first met Dick was when he was about seven and over the years\nalways found him generous and welcoming.\n\n\u201cBigger than life, in every sense of the word,\u201d Morris said, listing off\nRutan's legacy in the Vietnam War, testing planes and on the Voyager flight.\n\u201cAny one of those contributions would make a legend in aviation. All of them\ntogether, in one person, is just inconceivable.\u201d\n\nWhittle said Rutan had been courageous in his final hours at the hospital \u2014\nsharp as a tack, calm and joking with them about what might come next after\ndeath.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the greatest pilot that\u2019s ever lived,\u201d Whittle said.\n\nDick Rutan is survived by his wife of 25 years Kris Rutan; daughters Holly\nHogan and Jill Hoffman; and grandchildren Jack, Sean, Noelle and Haley.\n\n### 1/1Dick Rutan, who set an aviation milestone when he flew nonstop around\nthe world, is dead at 85\n\n### Dick Rutan, who set an aviation milestone when he flew nonstop around the\nworld, is dead at 85\n\nObit Dick Rutan\n\nAP1985\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
