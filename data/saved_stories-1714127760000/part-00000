The Keret House was first conceived as a seemingly\nimpossible vision of the Polish architect Jakub Szczesny of Centrala, who\nfirst presented the idea as an artistic concept during the WolaArt festival in\n2009. Now, three years later, the vision has become a reality and is drawing a\nsignificant amount of international attention to the city of Warsaw.\n\nBuilt between two existing structures from two historical epochs, the narrow\ninfill is more of an art installation that reacts to the past and present of\nWarsaw. Although the semi-transparent, windowless structure\u2019s widest point\nmeasures only 122 centimeters, it\u2019s naturally lit interior doesn\u2019t seem nearly\nas claustrophobic as one would think.\n\nThe Keret House will serve indefinitely as a temporary home for traveling\nwriters, starting with Israeli writer Etgar Keret.\n\nImages and the architects\u2019 description after the break...\n\nKeret House is the installation art in the form of an insert in between two\nexisting buildings. The project was launched on Saturday 20th of October in\nWarsaw. It is led by the Israeli writer Etgar Keret.\n\nSave this picture!\n\n\u00a9 Polish Modern Art Foundation / Bartek Warzecha\n\nArtistic hermitage in public space\n\nSave this picture!\n\n\u00a9 Polish Modern Art Foundation / Bartek Warzecha\n\nKeret House is fully functional space in which one can live as well as create.\nIt is located between buildings at Chlodna 22 Street and Zelazna 74 Street.\n\u201cWe deeply believe it will become a symbol of modern Warsaw ingrained in its\ncomplicated history. The House attracts attention of media from entire world.\nHe hopes it will show the most fascinating side of Warsaw\u201d, said project\ncurators Sarmen Beglarian and Sylwia Szymaniak form Polish Modern Art\nFoundation.\n\nThe House is located on the plot measuring 92 centimeters in its narrowest\npoint and 152 centimeters in its widest point. \u201cThat is why at first it seems\nthat the construction of living space within such premise is impossible. Keret\nHouse is to contradict that false image, simultaneously broadening the concept\nof impossible architecture\u201d, says the architect Jakub Szczesny. The house\nitself is 72 centimeters in the narrowest and 122 centimeters in the widest\npoint.\n\nSave this picture!\n\n\u00a9 Polish Modern Art Foundation / Bartek Warzecha\n\nIn the fracture of history\n\nSave this picture!\n\n\u00a9 Polish Modern Art Foundation / Bartek Warzecha\n\nThe house is located between two buildings from two historical epochs. \u201cThe\nfirst is a brick building on Zelazna Street \u2013 a fragment of the pre-world war\nII city, almost no longer existing. The second \u2013 a cooperative concrete\napartment building, an element of an \u201cimposed structure\u201d, which was aimed at\nnegating the previous city landscape. Their adjacency is coincidental \u2013 like\nmany architectural structures in Warsaw. Keret House is a perfect example of\nthe so-called \u201cnon-matching\u201d in the city\u2019s urban fabric. Another reason is the\ncity\u2019s war history \u2013 where the house is located, two ghettos \u2013 the large\nghetto and the small ghetto met. Only a few steps from the house, a bridge\nconnecting the two closed spaces, stood\u201d, explains Jakub Szczesny.\n\nProject\u2019s Founder/Concept Designer: Jakub Szczesny Art Curators: Sarmen\nBeglarian, Sylwia Szymaniak Executive Producer: Joanna Trytek \u2013 Black Salt\nProduction\n\nSave this picture!\n\n\u00a9 Polish Modern Art Foundation / Bartek Warzecha\n\nOrganizer: Polish Modern Art Foundation Co-financing: the Capital City of\nWarsaw Partner: National Centre for Culture\n\nSponsor: LHI General conctractor: AWBUD Partners: GIRA, Kingspan, Decoroom,\nVolunta Parket, Milantex, Polish Institute in Tel Aviv, White & Case,\nKostrzewa PR, Chylinski Family, Jewish Community in Warsaw, Chlodna Comedy\nClub, PMG Partners, Biuro Wystaw\n\nThe Keret House project was run by Polish Modern Art Foundation.
