Boot splash screen? no problem.\nCustom Interface for your Home Automation Project? sure thing. Stream media\nprocessing? Of course.\n\nIt has been used in a number of both experimental, hobby, academic research\nand commercial projects and products alike, in areas ranging from VR desktops\nto industrial computer vision systems for robotic automation.\n\nAt its heart lies a robust and portable multimedia engine, with a well-tested\nand well-documented Lua scripting interface for high level controls, one IPC\nsystem (SHMIF) for de-coupling with two low level APIs (arcan-shmif and arcan-\ntui) for more intense work.\n\nOn the other side of this IPC system are everything from media encoders and\ndecoders to networking bridges and services for protocols such as Wayland,\nX11, VNC and VT100 as well as command line shells which sidesteps terminal\nprotocols entirely.\n\nAt every step of the way, the underlying development emphasises security,\nperformance and debug-ability guided by a principle of least surprise in terms\nof API design.\n\nThe overarching project (\u2018The Arcan Project\u2019) is a research umbrella covering\nmost facets of operating system development, with the larger goal of building\na user facing networked overlay operating system and a browser for future\nwebs. For more on that, see the post on \u201cArcan as Operating System design\u201c.\n\nSee the Videos page for videos from some of the public projects built using\nthe engine as a main component. Most of the detailed user and development\ndocumentation can be found on the Wiki and the development discussion goes on\nin the #arcan IRC channel on libera.\n\nFor a high-level presentation, please refer to this video:\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### 1 Response to About\n\n  1.
