You could\nbuy a brand-new 4K display with quantum dots, high dynamic range, and a fast\nrefresh rate, or splurge on a curved QHD monitor so wide that it stretches\ninto your peripheral vision while playing.\n\nAlternatively, you could venture onto eBay and spend similar money on a CRT\nmonitor from 20 years ago.\n\nThe latter option might not be as ill-advised as it seems. Within PC gaming\ncircles, some people insist that cathode ray tube monitors, despite their\nlower resolutions, smaller screens, and considerable bulk, are superior for\ngames because they respond to input faster and have less motion blur than\nLCDs. Although this argument's been floating around for years, it just got a\nnew wave of attention from Eurogamer's Digital Foundry, which recently created\na video extolling the outdated display tech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Today's premium-priced gaming LCDs are trying very hard to recapture CRT's\nmajor benefits\u2014low latency, high refresh rates and reduced input lag\u2014but as\ngood as many of these screens are, for our money nothing beats a good old-\nfashioned cathode ray tube display for desktop gaming\u2014not even the very best\nLCD screens on the market,\" Digital Foundry editor Richard Leadbetter wrote.\n\nUnfortunately, getting a CRT monitor that works well with modern PC games is a\nlot harder than buying a 4K LCD monitor on Amazon. While CRT TVs and monitors\nare readily available on Craigslist or your local thrift store (sometimes even\nfor free) only a handful of models support the widescreen aspect ratios that\nsome modern games require. The most prized CRT monitor of them all, Sony's\nGDM-FW900, recently sold for $999 on eBay, and buying a compatible graphics\ncard or video adapter could raise the final cost even further.\n\nThe payoff, however, will be imperceptible input lag and no motion blur, along\nwith a feeling, perhaps, that you've kept another aging monitor out of an\ne-waste graveyard. PC gamers have arguably spent more for less before.\n\n## The case for CRT gaming\n\nOn a CRT monitor, the screen is coated in millions of phosphor dots, with one\nred, green, and blue dot for every individual pixel. To light up each pixel,\nan electron beam scans across the screen, focusing electrons on individual\nphosphor dots and causing them to emit photons. Applying more voltage to the\nsystem generates more electrons, in turn causing each dot to emit more light.\n\nThat's a lot to wrap your head around, but the thing to keep in mind is that\nthe electron-to-photon exchange happens instantly. While CRTs do have some\nsources of lag\u2014namely, the time spent buffering each video frame and scanning\neach line of the frame from top to bottom on the screen\u2014those delays are on\nthe order of microseconds. When you move your mouse or press a button on the\nkeyboard, the response time is imperceptible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's the chemistry of the phosphors,\" said Barry Young, a longtime CRT\ndisplay analyst who is now the CEO of the OLED Association. \"You hit it with\nan electron, and it creates a photon immediately.\"\n\nBy contrast, an LCD requires physical movement on the part of every pixel. On\nan LCD, the back of the display emits a constant stream of white light, which\npasses through a polarizer and onto an array of liquid crystals. Applying\nvoltage to each crystal causes them to twist, altering the amount of light\nthat comes through the screen's front polarizer.\n\nCompared to electron-photon conversion, the physical movement of liquid\ncrystals inside an LCD display takes a lot more time, introducing input lag.\nIt also creates blurriness when there's a lot of motion happening across the\nscreen.\n\nRaymond Soneira, the president of display research firm DisplayMate, has found\nthat this issue even persists on panels with faster refresh rates than the\nusual 60 Hz. This may explain why Digital Foundry's John Linneman described\nthe CRT experience as \"cleaner, smoother, [and] nicer\" compared to even the\nbest LCDs.\n\n\"The issue here is that you're comparing an electronic conversion\u2014that is,\nfrom an electron to a photon\u2014with physically twisting the liquid crystal,\"\nYoung said. \"The faster something moves across the panel, the less capable an\nLCD is with keeping up with the movement.\"\n\nIn fairness, LCD panel makers have done a lot to close the gap with CRTs.\nYoung points out that liquid crystals twist faster than they used to, and LCD\npanels can further reduce latency and motion blur by buffering an additional\nframe in their timing controllers or inserting artificial frames.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the CEO of the OLED Association, he also argues that OLED displays provide\nthe same responsiveness as CRT monitors because they also involve electron-to-\nphoton conversion, only with organic chemicals (the \"O\" in OLED is for\norganic) receiving the voltage instead of phosphor dots.\n\n\"There's really no difference between OLEDs and CRTs,\" Young said.\n\nStill, large-screen OLED panel makers to date have focused nearly all their\nenergy on televisions, so the only OLED monitor on the market today is a\n22-inch panel from Asus that costs $4,000. Young said the manufacturer of\nthose panels, JOLED, is building a larger factory next year, bringing down\ncosts, It may be a while until OLED monitors can compete with even the best\nLCDs on price.\n\n## Hunting for the CRT holy grail\n\nIf you're convinced that a CRT monitor is the way to go, you'll still have a\nlot of competition in finding a great one.\n\nAdam Taylor, who creates educational tech videos under the name EposVox on\nYouTube, has spent years trying to find a Sony GDM-FW900 in decent condition.\nHe's set up multi-keyword searches on sites like eBay, Craigslist, and\nFacebook Marketplace, and regularly puts out feeler posts in his area to see\nif anyone might have any leads. For a monitor that doesn't need any repairs\nand doesn't have any major cosmetic issues, Taylor said in an interview that\nhe's willing to pay up to $500.\n\nThe FW900's big selling point, Taylor said, is its 16:10 aspect ratio, which\nis much wider than the 4:3 aspect ratio of most CRT monitors. Although a 16:9\naspect ratio is more common among LCD monitors today, most games still support\n16:10, which would fill the entire screen on a FW900. The monitor also has a\nmaximum resolution of 2304x1440 at a refresh rate of 80 Hz\u2014pretty good even by\nmodern standards\u2014and it can hit a super-smooth refresh rate of 160 Hz when the\nresolution is cut in half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It can do ridiculous things while still supporting a modern workflow, because\nit's 16:10,\" Taylor said.\n\nBeyond the FW900, Taylor said the same monitor has sold under different makes\nand models, including the HP A7217A, SGI GDM-FW9011, and Sun GDM-FW9010, but\nthose are no easier to come by. A couple 16:9 CRT monitors also exist,\nincluding the Intergraph InterView 28HD96 (famously used by John Carmack to\ncode Quake) and 24HD96, but they're even rarer.\n\nEven if you can find one, you'll need a graphics card with an analog output,\nsuch as Nvidia's 900 series and AMD's 300 series cards, or a digital-to-analog\nconverter. You'll also have to go in knowing the monitor may not last. As the\nphosphor inside a CRT ages, it will naturally lose its luminance, and that's\nassuming it doesn't suffer any other issues along the way. Repairing a CRT can\nbe tedious and dangerous, Taylor says, and repair shops are practically\nnonexistent.\n\n\"It's one of those things, you don't get to keep it forever,\" Taylor said.\n\"You know that getting into it, because it's very old technology that is very\nprone to problems and needing maintenance.\"\n\nStill, Taylor is he's glad to see CRT monitors getting another round of\nattention. That's not always the case with some of his fellow CRT enthusiasts,\nwho fear that more media coverage will inflate prices and bring in too many\nnewbies, Taylor said. But outside of some occasional instances of people\ncapitalizing on the hype (like the FW900 that sold for $999 on eBay) he hasn't\nseen much evidence of price gouging. Most CRT monitor sales, he said, come\nfrom people who've hoarded them in garages and basements and just want to get\nrid of them.\n\nBesides, getting CRTs into the hands of people who want to play with them is\nbetter than having them wind up in warehouses, waiting for a recycling\nsolution that never comes.\n\n\"We have no way established, at least in the U.S., to get rid of these things,\nand so to see people use them and have fun with them in a way that keeps them\nfrom just being destroyed pieces of glass and lead in the streets is a super\ngood place for me,\" Taylor says. \"There's a whole elitist, 'This is better,'\naspect to it, but just using the screens and having fun, I think, is really\nimportant.\"\n\nTagged:TVLCD\n\n### ONE EMAIL.
