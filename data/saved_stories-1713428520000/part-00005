They apply to your\nuse of our services.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The section titled \u201cSettling Disputes Between You and Discord\u201d\ncontains an arbitration clause and class-action waiver that applies to all\nU.S.-based Discord users. Please read this section carefully as it may\nsignificantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit\nin court.\n\nWhen we say \u201cDiscord,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d in these terms, we mean Discord\nInc., its subsidiaries, and its related companies.\n\nWhen we say \u201cservices\u201d in these terms, we mean Discord\u2019s services, apps,\nwebsites, and other products.\n\nWhen we say \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour,\u201d we mean you. If you\u2019re accessing our services on\nbehalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the\nauthority to bind that entity to these terms, and \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d will refer\nto that entity.\n\nWe also have a Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and these other policies\nthat apply to your use of our services and are incorporated into these terms.\nYou should read these policies\u2014we\u2019ve worked hard to make them simple and\nclear, and they contain important information about your use of our services.\nIf you use our API, Discord\u2019s Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy\napply to that use. Discord\u2019s Paid Services Terms apply to any purchase you\nmake through Discord, and Discord\u2019s Monetization Terms apply to any sales you\nmake through Discord.\n\nTogether, these rules make Discord possible, and they matter to us. If you\nbelieve others aren\u2019t following them, please let us know by reporting it to\nus.\n\n## Who we are\n\nWe provide services that allow you to interact with other Discord users (such\nas through direct messages and group direct messages) and participate in large\nand small spaces (or \u201cservers\u201d). Our services may also include access to\ncertain software, features, and content, including items that you can purchase\nfrom us or others. Additional terms may apply to those purchases.\n\nDiscord Inc. is located at 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107,\nUSA. Discord Netherlands B.V. is located at Schiphol Boulevard 195, 1118 BG\nSchiphol, Netherlands.\n\n## Age requirements and responsibility of parents and legal guardians\n\nBy accessing our services, you confirm that you\u2019re at least 13 years old and\nmeet the minimum age required by the laws in your country. We maintain a list\nof minimum ages around the world as a resource for you, but we aren\u2019t able to\nguarantee that it is always accurate. If you are old enough to access our\nservices in your country, but not old enough to have authority to consent to\nour terms, your parent or legal guardian must agree to our terms on your\nbehalf. Please ask your parent or legal guardian to read these terms with you.\nIf you\u2019re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child (who must meet\nthe minimum age for your country) to use the services, then these terms also\napply to you and you\u2019re responsible for your child\u2019s activity on the services,\nincluding purchases made by them. For more information on purchases, see\n\u201cDiscord\u2019s Paid Services\u201d below.\n\n## What you can expect from us\n\nDiscord is the best place to talk, hang out and have fun with friends online.\nTo do that, we provide different digital spaces where you can connect with\nother Discord users and communities. Discord users communicate primarily via\n\u201cservers,\u201d which are digital spaces made up of different types of channels.\nText channels allow users to interact via text-based messages, as well as\nimages, GIFs, emoji, and other uploadable media. Voice channels allow users to\ncommunicate by voice and/or streaming video. Users can also communicate one-\nto-one using direct messages, or communicate with a limited number of users\nvia group direct messages. We\u2019re always evolving our services, and we may\ncreate other types of spaces in the future!\n\nUsers create servers, and users choose which servers to join and who their\n\u201cfriends\u201d are. All users must follow our Community Guidelines and other\npolicies, but in Servers, the server owners and server admins control the\nserver permissions and additional rules, including establishing membership\nrequirements and creating custom roles and what those roles can do within the\nserver. Server owners and admins also control whether to make their server\navailable in Server Discovery, whether to publish their server invite link on\npublic websites, whether to enable community growth and safety features, and\nwhether to add bots or other apps. These permissions, like the size of a\nserver, may change over time.\n\nDiscord is designed to make communicating with the people you want to speak to\nas easy as possible. Posts appear in text channels in the order in which\nthey\u2019re made. Voice and video communication happens in real time. We may build\nfeatures that help you create content and communicate with others, join\nconversations more easily, or may highlight content and activity available to\nyou on Discord that might be of interest. Discord was also designed to make it\neasy to share what you\u2019re up to. You can stream what you\u2019re doing on your\ndevice, or you can share your status, including what game you're playing, what\nsong you\u2019re listening to (if you link a music account), and more. Sharing\ngameplay is fundamental to the Discord experience, so it\u2019s turned on by\ndefault. You can turn it off in your Settings at any time, and you\u2019re in\ncontrol of whether or not you connect other accounts to Discord.\n\nDiscord\u2019s services may be personalized to each user based on their activity,\nso that you can see content and communities that may be of interest to you.\nYou can control whether and to what extent Discord personalizes your\nexperience in your Settings.\n\nWe\u2019re actively developing new features and products to improve Discord. As\npart of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering new\nservices, or stop offering some services entirely (or just in some places or\nfor some users) if they no longer make sense from a business perspective or\ncreate risk for Discord, our users, or other third parties. While we try to\navoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or\nchange to the services, and your content may not be retrievable due to such\noutages or changes. We are not liable for any such outages or service changes.\n\n## Your Discord account\n\nTo access the services on an ongoing basis, you will need to create a Discord\naccount. You can provide a username and password, and a way of contacting you\n(such as an email address and/or phone number). You\u2019ll also need to provide\nyour birthday. In some cases, you may be required to verify your account or\nprovide additional information.\n\nYou are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree to notify\nus immediately if you believe your account has been compromised. If you use a\npassword, it must be strong, and we (strongly) recommend that you use that\npassword only for your Discord account and that you enable two-factor\nauthentication.\n\nYou must always provide accurate information to Discord and maintain the\naccuracy of the information associated with your account. We may assume that\nany communications we\u2019ve received from your account or the associated contact\ninformation have been made by you, and that any purchases made using your\naccount were made by you.\n\nIf you get locked out of your account, we\u2019ll need to contact you at the email\nor phone number associated with your account. If your account is compromised\nor you no longer have access to your email account or phone number, we may not\nbe able to restore your access to your account or the servers you\u2019ve created.\n\nYou agree not to license, sell, lend, or transfer your account, Discord\nusername, vanity URL, or other unique identifier without our prior written\napproval. We also reserve the right to delete, change, or reclaim your\nusername, URL, or other identifier.\n\n## Content in Discord\u2019s services\n\n#### Your Content\n\nWhen we say \u201cyour content\u201d in these terms, we mean all the things you add\n(upload, post, share, stream, etc.) to our services. This includes text,\nlinks, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, or other media. If we come up\nwith another way for you to add content to the services, it includes that too.\n\nYou don\u2019t have any obligation to add content to the services. If you choose to\nadd content to the services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have\nthe right to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in this\nsection of these terms, and that your content is lawful. We take no\nresponsibility for any of your content, and we are not responsible for others\u2019\nuse of your content.\n\nOur services allow users to add content in a number of different ways,\nincluding via direct messages, group direct messages, and in small and large\nservers. Some of these servers may be larger spaces, and if you share content\nwithin them, that content may be more likely to be accessed by a lot of\npeople. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery\nsection of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server\nowners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can\naccess these spaces. You should be aware that these permissions are set by\nserver owners or admins, and they may change over time. Please understand\nwhere you are posting on Discord, familiarize yourself with the relevant\nserver permissions when joining and posting in a certain space, and choose the\nright space, features, and settings for you and your content.\n\nYour content is yours, but you give us a license to it when you use Discord.\nYour content may be protected by certain intellectual property rights. We\ndon\u2019t own those. But by using our services, you grant us a license\u2014which is a\nform of permission\u2014to do the following with your content, in accordance with\napplicable legal requirements, in connection with operating, developing, and\nimproving our services:\n\n  * Use, copy, store, distribute, and communicate your content in manners consistent with your use of the services. (For example, so we can store and display your content.)\n  * Publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content if you\u2019ve chosen to make it visible to others. (For example, so we can display your messages if you post them in certain servers or recommend that content to others.)\n  * Monitor, modify, translate, and reformat your content. (For example, so we can resize an image you post to fit on a mobile device.)\n  * Sublicense your content, to allow our services to work as intended. (For example, so we can store your content with our cloud service providers.)\n\nThis license is worldwide, non-exclusive (which means you can still license\nyour content to others), royalty-free (which means there are no fees for this\nlicense), transferable, and perpetual.\n\nWe reserve the right to block, remove, and/or permanently delete your content\nif it is in breach of these terms, our Community Guidelines, our other\npolicies, or any applicable law or regulation, or if it creates risk for\nDiscord or negatively impacts the experience or interests of other Discord\nusers to continue to make it available.\n\nWe welcome feedback on our services. By sending us feedback, you grant us a\nnon-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable license to use the\nfeedback and ideas generated from the feedback without any restrictions,\nattribution, or compensation to you.\n\n#### Discord\u2019s content\n\nOur services include some content that belongs to us, such as the design of\nour apps and websites, our art and images, and content written by us. You may\nuse our software as outlined in these terms. You may only use our trademarks\n(or other brand indicia) and copyrights as permitted in our Brand Guidelines\nor with our prior written permission. We retain all intellectual property\nrights in our content.\n\n#### Other content\n\nOther people\u2019s content. Our services might also provide you with access to\nother people\u2019s content. You may not use this content without that person\u2019s\nconsent, or as allowed by law. Other people\u2019s content is theirs and doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily reflect Discord\u2019s own views. Discord doesn\u2019t endorse or verify the\naccuracy or reliability of content shared by Discord users. We work hard to\ntry to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place, but cannot always\nprevent you from encountering content that you may find objectionable or\noffensive. You agree we will not be liable for any harm caused by that\ncontent. You may report content that you think violates any of our policies.\nWe have the right, but not the obligation, to review such reports and block or\nremove content at our discretion.\n\nThird party features and content. Our services may also allow you to access\nthird-party websites, features, apps, or other content. We provide you access\nonly as a convenience to you, and are not responsible for the content or\nservices available from these websites or resources.\n\n## Software in Discord\u2019s services\n\nLicense to our software. Some of our services allow you to download client\nsoftware. So long as you comply with these terms, we grant you a worldwide,\nnon-exclusive, personal, and non-assignable license to download, install, and\nrun that software, solely to access our services.\n\nYou may not copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute,\nsell, lease, or sublicense any of our software or services. You also may not\nreverse engineer or decompile our software or services, attempt to do so, or\nassist anyone in doing so, unless you have our written consent or applicable\nlaw permits it.\n\nAlthough we are granting you this license, we retain any intellectual property\nrights we have in our software and services.\n\nOpen source. Some of Discord\u2019s services include software subject to separate\nopen source license terms, and your use of those services are subject to your\ncompliance with those license terms, when applicable. We encourage you to\nreview them, as some licenses may explicitly override these terms.\n\nThird-Party Services. Discord may allow you to access apps, bots, or other\nproducts, features, or services developed by third parties (\u201cthird-party\nservices\u201d). It\u2019s your choice whether to use these third-party services and\nwhether to participate in Discord servers that incorporate them. You should\nreview any terms and policies provided by the third parties before doing so as\nthey govern your use of their services. While these third parties do need to\nfollow all policies that apply to them (which may include these Terms, our\nCommunity Guidelines, Developer Terms of Service, and Developer Policy),\nDiscord is not responsible for any third-party services.\n\n## Copyright\n\nWe respect the intellectual property of others and expect our users to do the\nsame. See our Copyright & IP Policy for information on how to file a copyright\ncomplaint.\n\n## Discord\u2019s paid services\n\nWe won\u2019t charge you a fee to use the basic functionality of our services, but\nyou may be able to pay for additional features and products.

You can learn more about our approach to safety and content\nmoderation in our Safety Center.\n\n## Termination\n\nYour right to terminate. You\u2019re free to stop using Discord\u2019s services at any\ntime and for any reason. To terminate this agreement, you may delete your\nDiscord account through the Settings page in the Discord app (the gear icon\nnext to your username) and discontinue use of the services. Certain provisions\nof these terms will survive termination as outlined below in the \u201cSurvival\u201d\nsection.\n\nDisabling your account limits the processing of your personal information as\ndescribed in our Privacy Policy.

You can appeal any enforcement action we take under these terms or other\npolicies, including terminations, suspensions, or content removals through\nthis form or available in-app options.

Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have\nan issue with the services, you agree to reach out to us before initiating a\nlawsuit or arbitration. This requires emailing disputes@discordapp.com a\nwritten notice (\u201cWritten Notice\u201d), which must include: (1) your name; (2) the\nemail address or phone number associated with your Discord account; (3) a\ndetailed description of the issue; and (4) how you\u2019d like to resolve it. If\nthe dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the\nWritten Notice, you and Discord agree to resolve any remaining dispute through\nfurther informal discussions or one of the formal dispute resolution\nprovisions below. You must engage in this informal resolution process before\nstarting any formal dispute resolution unless exempted by law. Applicable\nstatutes of limitations and due dates for arbitration filing fees or other\ndeadlines will be tolled upon receipt of the Written Notice to\ndisputes@discordapp.com, while the parties attempt informal resolution.\n\nIf you reside in the European Union, you may also be entitled to submit your\ncomplaint to the European Commission\u2019s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR)\nPlatform or the Out-of-Court Dispute Settlement (\u201cOCDS\u201d) mechanism under DSA\nArticle 21. ODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online\npurchases of goods and services without going to court. Note that a submission\nto the ODR or via the OCDS mechanism alone, without submitting a Written\nNotice to disputes@discordapp.com, will not toll the applicable statutes of\nlimitations or other deadlines.\n\nGoverning law and jurisdiction. The Federal Arbitration Act, federal\narbitration law, and California law will apply to these terms and any disputes\nrelated to these terms or our services, regardless of conflict of laws rules.\nAny dispute that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved exclusively in\nthe state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California, and you and\nDiscord both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in these courts.\n\nIf you are a consumer residing in the European Union, this clause and these\nterms in general do not affect any mandatory consumer rights you may have\nunder your local law, and all disputes arising in connection with the services\nand/or these terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the\ncourt of Amsterdam, the Netherlands or, if you are a consumer, to a court\ncloser to your domicile if in an EU Member State.\n\nAgreement to arbitrate.\n\nIF YOU\u2019RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY\nARBITRATION PROVISIONS. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY \u2013 IT MAY\nSIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT\nIN COURT:\n\nYou and Discord agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the\ninterpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. Except for the\ncircumstances described below, and only after the parties have engaged in a\ngood-faith, but unsuccessful, effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with\nthe \u201cinformal resolution\u201d process (above), you and Discord agree to resolve\nany dispute, disagreement, or claim relating to these terms or our services\nthrough final and binding arbitration in the U.S. county where you reside.\nThis includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring\nbefore the existence of this arbitration agreement or any prior agreement as\nwell as claims that may arise after the termination of this arbitration\nagreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth in\nsection.\n\nArbitration rules. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator,\ngoverned by these terms and the American Arbitration Association Rules,\nexcluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or\nrepresentative actions (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), available at\nhttps://www.adr.org/active-rules. These terms will govern if there\u2019s a\nconflict between these terms and the AAA Rules. To begin the arbitration\nproceeding, either party must submit a written Demand for Arbitration\n(available at www.adr.org) with the AAA and provide a copy to the other party\nas specified in the AAA Rules. To provide notice to Discord, please send an\nemail with the subject line \u201cArbitration Demand\u201d to disputes@discordapp.com.\n\nIf the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000, and you do not seek\ninjunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted\nsolely on the basis of documents you and Discord submit to the arbitrator,\nunless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in\ncontroversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either\nparty may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which\nmay be in-person, videoconference, or telephone conference.\n\nArbitration costs. AAA sets forth fees for its services, which are available\nat www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Fee_Schedule.pdf. If Discord is\nthe party initiating an arbitration against you, Discord will pay all costs\nassociated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you\ninitiate an arbitration against Discord, you will be responsible for the first\n$100 toward the nonrefundable Initial Filing Fee, unless the arbitrator\ndetermines that you are unable to pay, in which case Discord will pay the\nentire filing fee. For cases seeking less than $75K, Discord will pay the\nremainder of the Initial Filing Fee and both parties\u2019 Administrative fees\n(unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating\nactivity to be conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous (under the\nstandard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11). For cases seeking\nmore than $75K, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with AAA\nRules.\n\nIn all arbitrations, unless otherwise required by law or the AAA Rules, you\u2019re\nresponsible for all other additional arbitration costs incurred, including\nattorney\u2019s fees and expert witness costs. The parties agree that AAA has\ndiscretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration\nfees due under AAA\u2019s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such\nmodification does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection\nto such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge\nby either party to the fees imposed by AAA does not constitute a default,\nwaiver, or breach of this Section while such challenge remains pending before\nAAA, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nOffer of Judgment. At least 14 days before the date set for an arbitration\nhearing, any party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow\njudgment on specified terms. If the offer made by the offering party is not\naccepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more\nfavorable award, the other party will not recover its post-offer costs and\nwill pay the offering party\u2019s costs from the time of the offer.\n\nArbitration Decision. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and\nbinding on you and Discord, and judgment to enforce the decision may be\nentered by any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Discord agree that\ndispositive motions will be allowed in the arbitration. Except as explicitly\nset forth in this arbitration section, the arbitrator, and not any federal,\nstate or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all\ndisputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability,\nenforceability or formation of these terms of service, including, but not\nlimited to any claim that all or any part of these terms of service are void\nor voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute\nregarding the payment of AAA or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such\npayments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator must follow these terms\nand can award the same damages and relief as a court. The arbitrator has the\nright to impose sanctions in accordance with the AAA Rules and procedures for\nany frivolous claims, improper claims, or submissions the arbitrator\ndetermines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party's failure\nto comply with this Section or claims filed on behalf of a claimant who is not\nparty to this agreement. No arbitration award or decision will have any\npreclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not\na named party to the arbitration.\n\nMass filings. If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are\nasserted against Discord or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel\nor entities (\u201cMass Filing\u201d), these additional rules will apply:\n\nIf you or your counsel file a demand for arbitration that fits within the\ndefinition of Mass Filing, you agree that your demand for arbitration will be\nsubject to the additional protocols set forth in this mass filing subsection.\n\nBellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators\nwhen there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or\nrelated parties. You and Discord agree to jointly ask the arbitrator to agree\nto the following procedures: The arbitrator will randomly assign sequential\nnumbers to each of the claims included in a Mass Filing, after which the\nclaims numbered 1-10 will be designated the \u201cInitial Test Cases\u201d and will\nproceed to arbitration. The Parties agree to decide on a single arbitrator for\nall Initial Test Cases and to consolidate the cases for pre-hearing procedures\nand the pre-hearing conference. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or\nthe schedule is extended, the arbitrator will render final awards for the\nInitial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference. If\nfewer than 5 Initial Test Cases resolve without a final decision of the\narbitrator because they are resolved in advance, cases will be selected in\nbatches of 10 and will proceed to arbitration until at least 5 have been\nresolved by a final arbitrator decision. The arbitrator\u2019s decisions for the\nInitial Test Cases shall be in writing and shall contain the essential\nfindings and conclusions of fact and law upon which the arbitrator based the\ndecision.\n\nThe results of the Initial Test Cases resolved by a final arbitrator decision\nwill then be given to a mediator who will try to facilitate a resolution of\nthe remaining cases. After the results are provided to the mediator, the\nmediator and the parties will have 90 days (the \u201cMediation Period\u201d) to agree\non a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding\ncases. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during the\nMediation Period, either Party may choose to opt out of the arbitration\nprocess and proceed in court with its remaining claims. Notice of the opt-out\nwill be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation\nPeriod. Opt out of arbitration under this section shall not be construed as\nopt out of the section titled \u201cClass Waiver\u201d below.\n\nAbsent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order\ndetermined by the sequential numbers assigned to claims in the Mass Filing.\n\nIf your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, any statute of\nlimitations applicable to your claims will remain tolled until your demand for\narbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.\n\nOther remedies. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nIn some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of\nlitigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than\nin court. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND DISCORD ARE EACH\nWAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\nYou may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you\npursuant to your state\u2019s law.\n\nOpt-out. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing an opt-out\nnotice to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com within 30 days of April 15, 2024 or\nwhen you first register your Discord account, whichever is later; otherwise,\nyou shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these\nparagraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Discord also will\nnot be bound by them.\n\nExceptions. You or Discord may still pursue claims, if they qualify,\nexclusively in small claims court in San Francisco County, California, and you\nand Discord both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in that court. The\nsmall claims court, and not any arbitrator or AAA, shall have the exclusive\nauthority to resolve disputes regarding whether a dispute is properly within\nthe jurisdiction of a small claims court. Additionally, disputes concerning\npatents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of\npiracy or unauthorized use of our services will not be subject to arbitration.\nEither party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in\na court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party\u2019s claims are time-\nbarred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not\nwaive a party\u2019s right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed\narbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall\nautomatically be stayed (and any applicable statute of limitations tolled)\npending the outcome of such action.\n\nClass waiver. IF YOU\u2019RE A U.S. RESIDENT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU AND\nDISCORD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR\nINDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED\nCLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, UNLESS DISCORD PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO\nCONSOLIDATE IN WRITING. If this specific paragraph is found unenforceable,\nthen the \u201cAgreement to arbitrate\u201d section will be null and void. If there is a\nfinal judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this\nparagraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only\nthat remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court.\nThe parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to\narbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and\nremedies. This subsection does not prevent you or Discord from participating\nin a class-wide settlement of claims.\n\nChanges to this Dispute Section: Discord will provide 30 days\u2019 notice of the\ndate of any material changes to this clause. Changes will become effective on\nthe 30th day and apply to all claims not yet filed. If you continue to use the\nsite after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which Discord\ndoes not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause. If you reject\nany such changes by opting out of the arbitration agreement, you may exercise\nyour right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but\nany prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of\nthe arbitration agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If Discord\nchanges this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted\nthis agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this agreement), you\nagree that your continued use of the Discord product(s) or services 30 days\nafter such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not\nagree to such change, you may opt out by providing notice as described in this\nsection.\n\n## More important stuff\n\nYou have certain rights that, by law, can\u2019t be limited by these terms, and we\nin no way intend to restrict those rights in these terms.\n\nEntire agreement.
