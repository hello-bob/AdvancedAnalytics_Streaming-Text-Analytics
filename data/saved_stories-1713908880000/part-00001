A new project hopes to develop a digital tool to decipher it.\n\nTironian Notes dates back to Roman times and became very popular in the Early\nMiddle Ages. With parchment so expensive, many manuscript writers wanted to be\nas efficient as possible. Therefore, instead of writing out whole words, they\nused a shorthand of simple lines. For example, the word for King (Latin:\nregis) looked like a x.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe use of Tironian Notes hit a high point during the Carolingian era, with at\nleast 14,000 words turned into shorthand. The system went into decline after\nthe 11th century and disappeared after the Middle Ages. Today, very few\nmedieval historians even know how to read this shorthand, making it very\ndifficult to read some manuscripts.\n\nAn example of Tironian Notes on an early medieval manuscript \u2013 Vatican\nLibrary, MS Reg. lat. 846, fol. 103v\n\nTo help resolve the problem, scholars at Heidelberg University and other\nGerman universities have created a new project \u2013 Deciphering Stenographic\nNotes in Historical Documents \u2013 with the help of 35,000 euros in funding from\nthe Volkswagen Foundation. They aim to developed a digital tool that could\ntranscribe and edit Tironian Notes on the basis of pattern recognition. They\nwill test the tool on a 9th-century commentary on the Roman poet Virgil. The\nmanuscript is largely unexplored and is now to be deciphered.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\n0:00 / 3:35\n\nCan You Move in Armour_\n\nCan You Move in Armour_\n\nAmazons of the North_ Viking Warrior Women in Norway_\n\nMedieval Archery at The Royal Garrison\n\nMedieval kitchen discovered in Czech Republic\n\nThe Middle Ages A Graphic History\n\nTudor Music\n\nRulers of the Carolingian Empire\n\nInfamous Women of the Middle Ages and Renaissance\n\nThe Origins of the First Crusade\n\nThe Medieval University\n\nHour by Hour Reconstructing a Medieval Breton Prayer Book\n\nAmazons of the North Viking Warrior Women in Norway\n\nInfamous Women of the Middle Ages and Renaissance\n\nCan You Move in Armour\n\nAnglo-Saxon cemetery discovered in England\n\n10 Things You Might Have Missed in the Bayeux Tapestry\n\nThe Virgil commentary \u201cVergilius Turonensis\u201d arose in the scriptorium \u2013 the\nwriting room \u2013 of St. Martin Abbey in Tours (France) and is today held in the\nBurgerbibliothek in Bern, Switzerland.
