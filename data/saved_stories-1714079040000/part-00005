The cost of implementing a\nfunctioning system that allows external auditors to sign off accounts is\nexpected to be more than \u00a3100 million more than initial estimates. In\nSeptember last year, the council was effectively declared bankrupt because of\nthe Oracle implementation and a string of equal pay claims going back a number\nof years, the bill for which has been estimated up to \u00a3760 million.\n\n  * Mega city council's Oracle ERP system still not legally safe, compliant... 2 years after rollout\n  * City council megaproject to spend millions for manual work Oracle system was meant to do\n  * City council megaproject mulls ditching Oracle after budget balloons to \u00a3131M\n  * Whether to move off Oracle is the $100M+ question for Europe's largest public body\n\nGreenway said that producing accounts for financial years 2022-2023 and\n2023-24 would be difficult \"because the audit trail was not switched on until\nAugust [or] September, which means we have at least half a year of\ntransactions with no audit trail and ability to test for fraud in that system.\nSo that's a concern.\"\n\nThe Register has asked the council to clarify in which year the audit trail\nwas switched on.\n\nIn October last year, a 12-page public interest report from external auditors\nGrant Thornton highlighted concerns over security and governance from when the\nsystem was first introduced. \"Some IT security systems were not implemented\nand there is an inadequate segregation of duties in the system,\" it said.\n\nCity councillor and member of the audit committee Meirion Jenkins, who also\nruns a business reselling and implementing Microsoft Dynamics 365 ERP systems,\nsaid: \"In my 40 years of selling and implementing these systems [neither Fiona\nGreenway or I] have ever seen this situation arise before. And neither of us\ncan offer an explanation as to why one would decide [not to implement audit\nfeatures]. That's a mystery.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Councillor Fred Grindrod, chair of the council's audit\ncommittee, asked why the Oracle system was still not \"safe and compliant\" in\nterms of legal and statutory obligations going into the new financial year,\nsomething Grant Thornton said would be \"absolutely crucial.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * ERP\n  * Oracle\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * ERP\n  * Oracle\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Database\n  * Mark Hurd\n  * MySQL\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Larry Ellison\n  * SAP\n\n#### More about\n\n7 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * ERP\n  * Oracle\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * ERP\n  * Oracle\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Database\n  * Mark Hurd\n  * MySQL\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Larry Ellison\n  * SAP\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Mega city council's Oracle ERP system still not legally safe,\ncompliant... 2 years after rollout\n\nFusion software misses another deadline, one external auditors for Birmingham\nCity Council described as 'absolutely crucial'\n\nDatabases8 days | 47\n\n#### Oracle scores big win with Fujitsu Japan for its Alloy partner cloud\n\nBut Big Red's $8 billion investment plan may not be all it seems\n\nChannel6 days | 1\n\n#### Oracle changes its tune with HQ move to Music City\n\nNashville 'ticked all the boxes' for Big Red's employees, says founder Ellison\n\nPaaS + IaaS1 day | 15\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### North American S/4HANA migrations ramping among SAP users\n\nSkills access still an issue for organizations hoping to beat the 2027 ECC\nsupport deadline\n\nDatabases10 days | 1\n\n#### UK county council misses deadline for \u00a37.3M RISE with SAP system launch\n\nGloucestershire reluctant to set new date in S/4HANA migration saga\n\nPaaS + IaaS13 days | 15\n\n#### Palantir and Oracle buddy up on cloud infrastructure\n\nBut do all Foundry workloads move to OCI?
