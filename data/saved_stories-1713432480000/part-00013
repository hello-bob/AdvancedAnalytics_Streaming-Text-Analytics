Killer, our first character, is\nat a party and drives home drunk. At a certain point in her journey, she\nswerves, hits the curb, and kills a pedestrian who was on the curb. Merely\nReckless, our second character, is in every way exactly like Killer but, when\nshe swerves and hits a curb, she kills no one. There wasn\u2019t a pedestrian on\nthe curb for her to kill. The difference between Killer and Merely Reckless is\na matter of luck.\n\nDoes Killer deserve more blame \u2013 that is, resentment and indignation \u2013 than\nMerely Reckless? Or, do Killer and Merely Reckless deserve the same degree of\nblame? We feel a pull to answer \u2018yes\u2019 to both questions. Let\u2019s consider why.\n\nOn the one hand, we believe that Killer deserves more blame than Merely\nReckless, because it\u2019s only Killer who causes the death of a pedestrian.\nPlausibly, a person can deserve extra blame for a bad result of her action\nthat she reasonably could have been expected to foresee, and causing the death\nof a pedestrian by driving drunk is that kind of bad consequence. So, even\nthough they deserve an equal degree of blame for their callous and reckless\ndriving, Killer deserves more blame overall, because only Killer\u2019s foreseeable\nmoral risk turns out badly.\n\nOn the other hand, we believe that Killer and Merely Reckless must deserve the\nsame degree of blame, because luck is the only difference between them, and\nluck, most of us think, cannot affect the praise and blame a person deserves.\nIt would be unfair for Killer to deserve more blame due merely to what\nhappened to her, because moral judgment is about a person and not what happens\nto her. So, they must deserve the same degree of blame.\n\nIn summary, our commonsense ideas about moral responsibility imply the\ncontradiction that Killer and Merely Reckless do and do not deserve the same\namount of resentment and indignation. More generally, our commonsense ideas\nabout moral responsibility have the paradoxical implication that luck in\nresults can and cannot affect how much praise and blame a person deserves.\n\nNevertheless, the vexation runs deeper. Luck clearly affects the results of\nactions but, less obviously, as I\u2019ll demonstrate, luck can also affect actions\nthemselves.\n\nFumbles, our third character, is in every way like Killer and Merely Reckless.\nThey all get drunk and decide to drive home in the dark, and they all walk on\nautopilot to their cars. Fumbles takes a slightly different path to her car\nfrom the others, trips over a patch of uneven lawn, and drops her keys down a\ndrain. Fumbles is forced to call a cab to take her home. Of course, it\u2019s a\nmatter of luck which path each person takes, because they\u2019re all oblivious to\nthe relative merits of the different routes to their cars. If Fumbles hadn\u2019t\ntaken that path and lost her keys, she would\u2019ve driven drunk just like Killer\nand Merely Reckless.\n\nNight Blind, our fourth character, has many of the same beliefs and character\ntraits as Killer, Merely Reckless and Fumbles. She differs from those three\nmainly by having horrendous night vision, and this incapacity distinguishes\nher character by making driving at night unthinkable for her. When Night Blind\ngets drunk in the evening, she doesn\u2019t even entertain the idea of driving\nhome. Of course, her having bad night vision is a matter of luck, like the\ngood vision of the others. If Night Blind had better vision (and if driving\ndrunk had also been an option for her), we might suppose that she would\u2019ve\ndecided to drive home drunk just like Killer, Merely Reckless and Fumbles.\n\nThe contradiction at the heart of our thinking extends to these new\ncharacters. On the one hand, we believe that luck affects the degree of blame\ndeserved by all four characters. We believe that Killer and Merely Reckless\ndeserve more blame than Fumbles, because they drive home drunk, and Fumbles\ndoes not. We also believe that Killer, Merely Reckless and Fumbles deserve\nsome degree of blame, but that Night Blind, who got a cab home, deserves no\nblame at all. In other words, we think that luck affects the degree of blame\neach person deserves.\n\nOn the other hand, we believe that luck cannot affect the blame that Killer,\nMerely Reckless, Fumbles and Night Blind deserve, and so believe that all four\ndeserve precisely the same degree of blame. The salient differences between\nthese four characters is something outside of their control: the location of\nthe pedestrian, tripping over uneven ground in the dark, or having bad night\nvision. But they each would\u2019ve driven drunk if they had been in the same\ncircumstance and had the same constitution. So, they all must deserve the same\ndegree of blame.\n\nSome philosophers believe that both sides of the contradiction I\u2019ve outlined\nare undeniable and leave it as a paradox. Most philosophers, however, are not\nsatisfied with paradoxes. As you might expect, many of them have attempted to\niron out this inconsistency in our thinking. Some suggested solutions are\npure. They allow luck to affect the moral responsibility in all four\ncharacters, or they preclude luck from affecting moral responsibility in all\nfour characters. Other solutions are mixed, because they allow luck to affect\nmoral responsibility in some but not other characters.\n\nThe skeptical response is a pure view that bars luck from affecting moral\nresponsibility in all four characters; every kind of luck must be factored out\nof moral evaluation. But luck saturates who we are (think of Night Blind),\nwhat we do (think of Fumbles), and what results from what we do (think of\nKiller and Merely Reckless). So, because luck must be factored out of moral\nevaluation, and luck permeates everything that we are, do and bring about, no\none is morally responsible for anything.\n\nOne problem with the skeptical response is that it\u2019s an empty victory; it\u2019s\nlike winning a battle by sacrificing most of what we care about. After all,\nthe skeptical response undermines our self-conception as morally responsible\nagents, and it requires practical revision of praising and blaming as\nindividuals, and practical revision of rewarding and punishing as governing\nauthorities. It is, then, worth exploring whether other responses can dissolve\nthe paradox in a way that preserves what we care about.\n\nThe character response is that people fundamentally deserve praise and blame\nonly for their character traits. This view implies that Killer, Merely\nReckless and Fumbles deserve equal blame, because they have the same character\ntraits that give rise to their decision to drive drunk. Whether they kill a\npedestrian or have an opportunity to drive drunk is irrelevant to their degree\nof blameworthiness. Night Blind, of course, lacks those traits; she wouldn\u2019t\ncontemplate driving drunk because she wouldn\u2019t contemplate driving at night\nand she drinks only at night. For this reason, Night Blind deserves no blame\non this account. The character response, then, is a mixed view. It precludes\nluck in results and circumstance from affecting moral responsibility in\nKiller, Merely Reckless and Fumbles, and it allows luck in constitution to\naffect Night Blind\u2019s moral responsibility by saving her from disgrace.\n\nAn unattractive feature of the character response, however, is that it appears\nto imply that when people act out of character, they don\u2019t deserve praise or\nblame. Intuitively, however, many of us think that people are morally\nresponsible for at least some of their uncharacteristic actions. Additionally,\nthe character response implies that it is always impermissible to praise and\nblame strangers, because we don\u2019t know much about the character of strangers.\nEven so, at least most of us think that it is at least possible to praise and\nblame a stranger in an apt way. Given these difficulties, let\u2019s consider the\nnext solution.\n\nIf luck can affect moral responsibility for actions, then it can also affect\nmoral responsibility for consequences\n\nThe acts response is that people fundamentally deserve praise or blame only\nfor what they actually do. On this view, luck makes no difference to the blame\nthat Killer and Merely Reckless deserve, because they perform the same kind of\naction. But luck makes a difference between the moral responsibility of Killer\nand Merely Reckless, on the one hand, and Fumbles and Night Blind, on the\nother, because luck in circumstance and constitution prevents Fumbles and\nNight Blind from acting in the same way as the other two did that night. The\nacts response, then, is a mixed view that bars luck in results from affecting\nthe blame a person deserves, but allows luck in circumstance and constitution\nto affect it.\n\nAlthough I view the acts response as more plausible than the other proposals\nI\u2019ve outlined so far, I do think it\u2019s an unstable position. After all, if luck\ncan affect moral responsibility for actions, then we have at least some reason\nto think that the same luck can also affect moral responsibility for\nconsequences. In terms of our examples, the fact that Merely Reckless deserves\nmore blame than Fumbles, even though the salient difference between them is a\nmatter of luck, provides some reason to think that Killer deserves more blame\nthan Merely Reckless even though the only difference between them is also a\nmatter of luck. Let\u2019s, then, turn to consider the final response.\n\nThe moral luck response is that some kinds of luck in results, circumstance\nand constitution affect the praise and blame a person deserves. On this view,\nKiller deserves more blame than Merely Reckless, because only Killer causes\nthe death of the pedestrian; Merely Reckless deserves more blame than Fumbles\nbecause, of the two, only Merely Reckless drives drunk; and Fumbles deserves\nmore blame than Night Blind because, of the two, only Fumbles decides to drive\ndrunk.\n\nGiven the problems that arise with the skeptical, character and acts\nresponses, we have a preliminary reason to think that the moral luck response\nis correct. But if the moral luck response is correct, why is there a\ncontradiction in our thinking in the first place? That is, how can we explain\nthe common intuitive reaction that, for example, Killer and Merely Reckless\ndeserve the same degree of blame when the moral luck response implies that\nthey deserve different amounts of blame?\n\nThe answer to this question comes from properly distinguishing two kinds of\ncommonsense moral evaluation that we tend to run together \u2013 namely, being to\nblame for bringing about an event and being a bad person. What makes someone a\ngood or a bad person? Plausibly, the moral quality of a person is determined\nby her character and so by her actual voluntary actions and what she would\nvoluntarily do. On this view, Killer and Merely Reckless are no better or\nworse persons than each other, because they voluntarily do the same kind of\nthing. Additionally, Killer, Merely Reckless and Fumbles are also no better or\nworse as persons than one another, because Fumbles would\u2019ve voluntarily done\nwhat Killer and Merely Reckless do if she had been in their circumstances.\n(Night Blind is relevantly different from those three. She has a different\ncharacter as evidenced by the unthinkability of driving drunk at night,\nbecause she never drives at night, and she drinks only at night.)\n\nThis distinction between being to blame for an outcome and being a bad person\nallows us to discriminate between the various cases. Killer isn\u2019t any worse a\nperson than Merely Reckless; but that doesn\u2019t show that they both merit the\nsame amount of blame, because blame isn\u2019t just about the kind of person you\nare. Likewise, although Merely Reckless is no worse a person than Fumbles is,\nit doesn\u2019t then follow that they are equally blameworthy.\n\nBeing a good or a bad person is about one\u2019s character; being blameworthy for\nan event is about being accountable for what you have done in the world. As an\nillustration, consider the example of Works Tonight. She has the same moral\ncharacter as Killer, Merely Reckless and Fumbles, and so would\u2019ve acted in the\nsame way as those three did if she had gone to the party. But she was called\nin to work that night, and so missed the party altogether. Plausibly, Works\nTonight isn\u2019t blameworthy for doing anything related to driving drunk, but\nWorks Tonight is just as bad a person as Killer, Merely Reckless and Fumbles.\n\nOnce we separate blame for actions and outcomes from blame for character, we\ncan see how we got into this conflicted state in the first place.\n\nWhich of these responses to the problem of moral luck is correct matters\ngreatly at least for praise and blame in our dealings with other people, for\nthe morality of some criminal laws, and for the morality of a final judgment\nafter death if there is such a thing.\n\nBut no matter which of these responses (or perhaps another not considered\nhere) turns out to be correct, there\u2019s a lesson we can all learn about luck,\nmoral pride and moral humility.\n\nOne form of moral pride involves the belief that we\u2019re self-made people. Moral\npride can make us feel superior to others and more liable to find fault with\nthem, because the belief that all persons are self-made implies that others\u2019\nbad traits are entirely of their own making. For the same reason, moral pride\ncan also undermine feelings of compassion towards those who have had difficult\nformative histories (such as early emotional trauma), faced hard moral\ndecisions (social pressure in Nazi Germany, for example), or had minimal help\nfrom others in the moral life (if, for example, they haven\u2019t had good role\nmodels).\n\nBut our reflections on Killer, Merely Reckless, Fumbles, Night Blind and Works\nTonight should shatter the illusion that we\u2019re self-made people. We\u2019re all\nsignificantly \u2013 but not entirely \u2013 shaped by luck. The recognition that we\u2019re\nnot wholly self-made should help us to credit others for their roles in our\nmoral lives and perhaps most importantly to be compassionate and generous to\nthose who are down on their luck. After all, with different luck, we might\nhave shared their fate.\n\nIn Defense of Moral Luck: Why Luck Often Affects Praiseworthiness and\nBlameworthiness by Robert Hartman is published via Routledge.\n\nEthicsHuman rights and justicePersonality\n\n24 July 2017\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHuman rights and justice\n\nMy elusive pain\n\nThe lives of North Africans in France are shaped by a harrowing struggle to\nbelong, marked by postcolonial trauma\n\nFarah Abdessamad\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nThinkers and theories\n\nPhilosophy is an art\n\nFor Margaret Macdonald, philosophical theories are akin to stories, meant to\nenlarge certain aspects of human life\n\nPeter West\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nNeuroscience\n\nHow to make a map of smell\n\nWe can split light by a prism, sounds by tones, but surely the world of odour\nis too complex and personal?
