Icon believe it.\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * Windows 1.x (1985) and Windows 2.x (1987)\n\n  * Windows 3.0 (1990)\n\n  * Windows 3.1 (1992)\n\n  * Windows 95 (1995)\n\n  * Windows 98 (1998)\n\n  * Windows 2000 and Windows Me (2000)\n\n  * Windows XP (2001)\n\n  * Windows Vista (2007)\n\n  * Windows 7 (2009)\n\n  * Windows 8 (2012) and Windows 8.1 (2013)\n\n  * Windows 10 (2015)\n\n  * Windows 11 and Beyond (2021)\n\nOver the past three-plus decades, the icons of Microsoft Windows have evolved\nalongside improvements in screen resolutions and color depth. Here's a look at\nhow the size and style of Windows icons have changed over time.\n\n## Windows 1.x (1985) and Windows 2.x (1987)\n\nIn the first two major releases of Windows, application icons only appeared if\nyou minimized a program to the taskbar at the bottom of the screen (in Windows\n1.x) or to the desktop (in Windows 2.x). Icons were simple black-and-white\nillustrations that were 32x32 pixels in size.\n\nTo run apps in Windows 1 or 2, you'd pick a file name from a list in a program\ncalled \"MS-DOS Executive.\" MS-DOS Executive didn't show icons, only the names\nof the files (as if you typed the \"dir\" command in DOS). In those days,\nWindows ran as a basic graphical shell over MS-DOS, so the basic list of files\nmade sense---even if it wasn't as visually appealing as later approaches.\n\nRelated: 35 Years of Microsoft Windows: Remembering Windows 1.0\n\n## Windows 3.0 (1990)\n\nWindows 3.0 introduced the capability to display 16-color icons that were\n32x32 pixels in size, and they featured a new \"3D\" look (as it was called at\nthe time) with simulated shadows, courtesy of artist Susan Kare. Kare had\npreviously designed icons and fonts for the original Macintosh.\n\nWith 3.0, Windows icons used color for the first time, and Kare imparted them\nwith the right mix of playfulness and business sense that made them very\nappealing. She set archetypes in Microsoft icon design that would filter down\nthrough future Microsoft apps and versions of Windows alike.\n\nRelated: Windows 3.0 Is 30 Years Old: Here's What Made It Special\n\n## Windows 3.1 (1992)\n\nIcons in Windows 3.1 resembled Windows 3.0 icons with more detail, despite\nstill being 32x32 pixels and 16 colors. Artists at Microsoft achieved this by\nusing dithering effects in the icons to simulate more color depth as well as\nby improving shadow effects in the illustration style.\n\n## Windows 95 (1995)\n\nIn Windows 95, many icon designs got a graphical overhaul, although some still\ncarried over from Windows 3.1. Most Windows 95 system icons shipped as\n32-by-32 pixel 16-color images by default. However, the Win32 API used in\nWindows 95 introduced support for 256x256 pixel icons with 16.7 million colors\nfor the first time. In fact, with the Plus! add-on pack (or a registry hack),\nyou could enable 65,536-color icons (called \"high color\" at the time),\nalthough not many Windows 95 users used them.\n\nRelated: Windows 95 Turns 25: When Windows Went Mainstream\n\n## Windows 98 (1998)\n\nWindows 98 shipped with 256-color icons by default in 32x32 pixel size. And\nfor the first time, Microsoft offered many system icons in a larger 48x48\npixel size. These were ideal for accessibility purposes and for use with high-\nresolution displays (although their usage was generally rare at the time).\nMany icon designs (such as My Computer and the Recycle Bin) received updates,\nbut Windows 98 also relied on many legacy icons from Windows 95 and even from\nWindows 3.1, in some cases.\n\n## Windows 2000 and Windows Me (2000)\n\nLike Windows 98, Windows 2000 shipped with 256-color system icons, which were\navailable in 32x32 and 48x48 pixel sizes. Several major desktop icons received\nfacelifts again, gaining more detail and color depth. Windows Me used many of\nthe same new icons as Windows 2000, including a new \"My Computer\" icon.\n\nRelated: Remembering Windows 2000, Microsoft's Forgotten Masterpiece\n\n## Windows XP (2001)\n\nWindows XP supported 32-bit icons (16.7 million colors and an alpha channel\nfor transparency) for the first time. This allowed for translucent shadow and\nglassy effects as well as for smoother icon edges, thanks to improved anti-\naliasing. As with Windows 2000, most XP system icons were either 32x32 or\n48x48 pixels in size.\n\nDesign-wise, XP's icons offered a fresh start, with rounded corners, more\ncolor depth, and the use of smooth gradients, noticeably moving away from\nKare's Windows 3.0 icon style for the first time. Even so, many icons for\nlesser-used apps and utilities carried over from earlier versions of Windows.\n\n## Windows Vista (2007)\n\nIn Windows Vista, Microsoft included a new Aero interface that emphasized\nglossy translucent effects and drop shadows. For the first time, Windows\nshipped with a set of 256x256 pixel system icons. The set wasn't complete,\nhowever, and smaller icons could be automatically scaled up to match.\nAccordingly, Windows Explorer in Vista allowed scaling icons dynamically to\nnon-standard sizes based on the user's personal preference.\n\nAs with XP, many of Vista's main app and utility icons received a sleek,\nglossy Aero-style redesign as Microsoft attempted to match the modern,\nresolution-independent look of Mac OS X.\n\nRelated: 20 Years Later: How the Mac OS X Public Beta Saved the Mac\n\n## Windows 7 (2009)\n\nWindows 7 used mostly the same icon set as Vista, but it changed some key\nicons for programs like Control Panel and Microsoft Paint. Several revised\nicons gained a more flat, heads-on appearance that began to move Microsoft\naway from the glossy 3/4 view icons in Vista.\n\n## Windows 8 (2012) and Windows 8.1 (2013)\n\nWindows 8 received a radical UI design with the Metro interface. Metro\nincluded a new type of icon called a \"Live Tile\" that allowed dynamic\ninformation updates within the tile itself (kind of like a mini-widget) on the\nStart Screen.\n\nIn Windows 8, many app icons became simple white silhouettes of objects or\nshapes over a solid, colored background. In addition, Windows 8 included\nregular desktop (File Explorer) icons, most of which were carried over from\nWindows 7 and earlier.\n\nRelated: Windows 8 Screenshot Tour: Everything You Possibly Want to Know\n\n## Windows 10 (2015)\n\nAt launch, Windows 10 initially carried over the look of Windows 8's Live\nTiles icons while also still using File Explorer icons held over from both\nWindows 8 and the Windows 7 era. Windows 10 also included some redesigned\ndesktop icons with a more angular look and softer gradients. Sometime in 2020,\nWindows began rolling out new application icons in the Microsoft Store that\nabandoned the flat, angular Live Tile look in favor of more colorful icons\nwith a more rounded design.\n\nAs it stands today, Windows 10's icon set is still a huge mixed bag of at\nleast three or four different legacy icon styles carried over from earlier\nversions of Windows.\n\n## Windows 11 and Beyond (2021)\n\nMicrosoft\n\nFor the past few years, Microsoft has been teasing a unified set of brand new\nicons for Windows 10, first including them in Windows 10X and then planning to\nrelease them in an upcoming \"Sun Valley\" update. Now, it looks like these\nicons might just roll out with Windows 11 instead---but only time will tell.\n\nRelated: Windows 11: What's New In Microsoft's New OS\n\nNotably, it looks like Windows 11 will abandon the Metro/Live Tile concept of\nWindows 8 and 10 completely, meaning that icons can have more depth and color.\nSo far, Microsoft is going for a flat cartoon look with low detail and gentle\ngradients. It's a welcome change for many users, especially if Microsoft can\nfinally move past the mixed bag of legacy icons currently found in Windows 10.\nThe future awaits!\n\nRelated: Windows 11 Confirmed: What We Learned From the Leaked Build\n\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.
