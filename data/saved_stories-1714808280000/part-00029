Let\u2019s look at this in\ncontext:\n\nConstant concerted efforts by state actors, but over decades, have had some\nlimited success.\n\nLinux, had a guy volunteer an make a backdoor because the maintainer of a key\npillar of most distros wasn\u2019t earning any money.\n\nThe reality for Microsoft is there still isn\u2019t very much genuine competition\nto it in the OS space when working in certified environments. (like\ngovernment). Redhat come closest, but quite a distant second.\n\nThe Main problem for Microsoft is actually that many of its customers don\u2019t\npatch/upgrade.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n     * 2024-05-02 10:01 pm\n\nCapEnt\n\nYou are really equating a failed attempt to put forward a backdoor targeting\nOpenSSH (and only when used with libsystemd) with actual severe consummated\nsecurity breaches of Microsoft cloud services targeting high level government\nofficials and agencies?\n\nMan, these are not even the same stuff. Did you even read the article? It\u2019s\nnot even about Windows.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n       * 2024-05-03 7:42 am\n\nAdurbe\n\nI did. Because they are related.\n\n\u201cfederal Cyber Safety Review Board released a long-anticipated report which\nshowed the company failed to prevent a massive 2023 hack of its Microsoft\nExchange Online environment. The hack by a People\u2019s Republic of China-linked\nespionage actor\u201d\n\nPlease point me towards the alternative mail services that\u2019s certified for use\nat high security institutions? I\u2019d suggest their arnt. Any from the open\nsource world.\n\nWhy are they not certified? Yes there is an element of money. But a far larger\nimpact is the trust of those those contributing code.\n\nXz is a recent, public, manifestation of the true side of FUD. The Uncertainty\nand Doubt of those contributing to key parts of systems.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n  2. 2024-05-03 12:04 am\n\nsukru\n\nThey had the same \u201cwake up\u201d moment during Windows XP era.\n\nThere were worms that would affect any Ethernet connected computer during\nsetup. Before even being able to install any firewalls or other security\nsoftware, your computer would be infected and spreading the worm to even more\ndevices.\n\nThat led them to do more or less a \u201call hands red alert\u201d on security and gave\nup XP SP2 along with a long stream of fixes and new tools: eventually a good\nfirewall, a free antivirus (defender), patch Tuesday, and many others.\n\nFor historical reference:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_(computer_worm)\n\nWhat that means is there is precedent for them to fix things very wlel...\nafter they become a real mess.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n     * 2024-05-03 12:05 am\n\nsukru\n\ngave us*\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n  3. 2024-05-03 9:58 am\n\nGeck\n\nI agree that Windows is a dinosaur and this will more and more start to show.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n### Our Sponsor\n\n### Search OSNEWS\n\n### OSnews Accounts\n\n    * Create Account\n    * Login\n\n### Featured articles\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n    * Setting up a YubiKey on Linux is a mess, and it really shouldn\u2019t be\n    * Fedora change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release to KDE Plasma\n\n### Topics\n\n### Related Posts\n\n    * Microsoft Eyes Open Source View\n\nApril 29, 2003 \u2022 10 Comments\n\n    * Microsoft Open-Sources Clever U-Prove Identity Framework\n\nMarch 3, 2010 \u2022 11 Comments\n\n    * Microsoft Office for iPad spotted?\n\nFebruary 21, 2012 \u2022 18 Comments\n\n    * Microsoft Debuts Windows Live OneCare\n\nMay 31, 2006 \u2022 35 Comments\n\n    * Next Mac Office Due Late 2010 With Outlook\n\nAugust 13, 2009 \u2022 11 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts\n\n    * Some personal news\n\nMarch 23, 2024 \u2022 69 Comments\n\n    * Linus Torvalds really prefers tabs\n\nApril 17, 2024 \u2022 64 Comments\n\n    * VMS Software guts its community licensing program\n\nApril 13, 2024 \u2022 50 Comments\n\n    * Chinese Tencent-owned Riot Games installs rootkit on every League of Legends players\u2019 computer\n\nMay 1, 2024 \u2022 49 Comments\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n\nApril 8, 2024 \u2022 46 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts (Last 3 Years)\n\n    * Apple\u2019s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors take its in-house Arm-based chips to new heights\n\nOctober 18, 2021\n\n    * Microsoft is testing a desktop watermark for unsupported Windows 11 PCs\n\nFebruary 27, 2022\n\n    * Rant: year of Linux on the desktop\n\nDecember 29, 2022\n\n    * A few thoughts on Fuchsia security\n\nJune 14, 2021\n\n    * Apple intentionally kills web applications for EU users in iOS 17.4 onward to spite its EU users\n\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\n### About OSnews\n\nOSnews Privacy Statement \u00a9 OSnews Inc.
