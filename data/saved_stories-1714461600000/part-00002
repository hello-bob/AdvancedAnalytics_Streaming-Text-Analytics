Due to recency bias, investors always focus on recent\nunderperformance and forget past outperformance.\n\nI believe the concept behind the ARKK ETF was sound and still is, but the\nmanagement was inadequate. They should have consulted CTAs on how to manage\npositions in volatile markets. CTAs know how investors behave, and for this\nreason, some target volatility. It is not always desirable, but if you want to\nstay in business, you have to take into account mass psychology and the\n\u201cmadness of crowds.\u201d\n\nIt appears that the management of ARKK ETF was satisfied with a return of 153%\nin 2020 and did not reduce positions with trailing or any other position\nmanagement method. Done ex ante, that would have significantly lowered the\nreturn for 2020, but also reduced the coming drawdown.\n\nBuy and Hold Performance of ARKK ETF. Backtest. Price Action Lab Blog. Norgate\nData.\n\nThe buy-and-hold equity performance chart shows how outperformance can turn\ninto weakness. The ETF returned nearly 153% in 2020, and normally a reversion\nto some mean was reasonable. I do not know if it was greed or miscalculation\nthat prevented applying volatility targeting, but the reversion occurred. It\ncan be seen from the bottom pane of the above chart that equity volatility\nstarted rising in 2020, and by the end of 2022, it had increased from about\n25% to nearly 33%. The increased volatility triggered an allocation reduction\nby portfolio managers, and that also contributed to a significant drawdown\nthat reached as high as 81% by the end of 2022; that was basically the end of\nthe promises and the start of damage control.\n\nHowever, the basic premise did not fail. The ARKK ETF is now (again) tracking\nmore closely the Nasdaq Next Generation 100 total return index ($NGXTR).\n\nIn fact, the correlation between the ARKK ETF and the Nasdaq Next Generation\n100 total return index was always high; just the volatility was different. The\naverage 0-lag, 24-month correlation has been +0.83, with a maximum of +0.94\nand a minimum of +0.58.\n\nNote how the correlation reached its maximum near the start of 2020. The\ntracking of the index was close, but the volatility of returns was much\ndifferent. Over the period considered, the volatility of the index has been\n21.4%, versus 38.1% for the ARKK ETF, or nearly double. This was enough to\ncreate problems.\n\nApparently, and in hindsight, the problem with ARKK ETF was its significant\noutperformance. It may sound paradoxical, but outperformance can turn into\nweakness in these markets. This is one reason some active managers target\nvolatility and risk-adjusted returns instead of total returns. Simply stated,\nthose who entered near the top make a lot of noise after a large loss,\nalthough in reality it was their own miscalculation. When you invest in a fund\nafter a 153% annual return, if you have a basic education in statistics, you\nshould assign a high probability to a large drawdown. The fact that those\ngreedy investors act as a herd and enter and exit the market at the same time\nonly makes the issue worse.\n\nI am not here to judge anyone, because outsiders always miss important pieces\nof the puzzle, but it is clear to me that ARKK ETF, although still a valid\nconcept, did not exercise relevant risk and money management methods,\nincluding but not limited to using trailing stops, dynamic stops, and\nvolatility targeting. Small private funds can always avoid these more\nsophisticated risk management methods and target absolute returns, but a\npublicly traded ETF with a large following on social media must be more\nsophisticated with its risk management, even when that would imply lower\nreturns. Few remember the 153% return of ARKK in 2022, and nearly everyone\nfocuses on the current 71% drawdown from all-time closing highs. In my\nopinion, it would be better to close this ETF and start a new one with better\nrisk management rules because this one will be haunted forever, not because it\nwas a bad idea but because of its outperformance in 2020.\n\nIt is paradoxical, but there cannot be markets without paradoxes.\n\nPremium Content\n\nYou have immediate access to hundreds of articles when you subscribe.
