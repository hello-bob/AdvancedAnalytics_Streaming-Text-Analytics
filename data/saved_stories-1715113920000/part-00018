That averages out to $2,500 a\nmonth since mid 2012. And, with near record interest rates and elevated home\nprices, I may end up paying another $350,000 in rent before I ever buy a\nhouse.\n\nI am a part of what you might call the Forever Renter class. This is a cohort\nof people in their mid-20s to late-30s who are either unwilling or unable to\nbuy a home under current market conditions. Unfortunately, those conditions\naren\u2019t moving in the right direction either. As Redfin recently reported, \u201cThe\nmedian U.S. home-sale price hit a record $383,725 during the four weeks ending\nApril 21, up 5.2% from a year earlier.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the median U.S. home that is setting records. Homes in many\nhigh cost of living areas are near their highs as well. Last month Zillow\nreported that there are now a record 550 \u201cMillion-Dollar\u201d cities in the United\nStates. These are cities where the typical home price is greater than $1\nmillion. While nearly half of these Million-Dollar cities are in California,\nthe New York metropolitan area has the most with 106:\n\nBut rising home prices are just one factor impacting affordability. High\ninterest rates are another.\n\nThe 30-Year mortgage rate peaked last October at 7.8% before dropping through\nyear end. At the time, the worst of it seemed to be over. However, with\ninflation coming in hotter than expected this year, many believe that the Fed\nwill no longer cut rates as planned in 2024. As a result, mortgage rates have\nstarted creeping up yet again with the 30-Year near 7.2% today:\n\nBut the final nail in the coffin for housing affordability is the slow growth\nin income. Incomes haven\u2019t risen in lockstep with housing prices and mortgage\nrates. For example, according to the National Association of Realtors, the\nmedian family income increased by 18% from $85,806 to $100,876 between 2021\nand February 2024.\n\nHowever, over the same time period, the monthly mortgage payment required to\npurchase the median U.S. home doubled:\n\nSo while American families were getting an 18% raise, their prospective\nhousing cost increased by 100%. Technically, the median sales price for new\nhouses in the U.S. has dropped by 13% since their peak in late 2022:\n\nHowever, this has done very little to affect affordability. Since rates are\nstill so high, the American Dream remains out of reach for so many.\n\nThis is why the Forever Renter class exists. Though incomes have increased,\nhousing costs have increased by far more. It\u2019s gotten so bad that Zillow\nestimated that homebuyers need to earn nearly $50,000 more today than in 2020\nto comfortably afford a home. And, in some cities in California, the amount of\nadditional income needed exceeds $100,000!\n\nBut, this only addresses a portion of the Forever Renter class\u2014those who are\nunable to buy a home. It ignores those who can afford to buy one, but choose\nnot to. Because, even if you could buy a house in this market, should you?\n\n## The Unwilling Buyers\n\nFor those that have the means to purchase a home in the current housing\nmarket, they may still choose not to if renting is much cheaper. While the\nnumbers vary by location, I ran an analysis a few weeks ago that suggests that\nrenting has the upper hand in many high cost cities.\n\nFor example, in a place like NYC, a Forever Renter could end up having to\ndecide between paying $4,000 a month to rent or $7,000 a month to buy the same\napartment. Even if they could afford such a high housing cost, would that be\nbetter than renting and investing the extra $3,000 a month into a diversified\nportfolio? My conservative estimate suggests not. For the time being, renting\nwins out.\n\nThis is where many in the unwilling Forever Renter class find themselves. They\nhave good jobs. They make good money. But interest rates are also the highest\nthey have been in two decades. As a result, if they want to borrow money to\nbuy a house, they will pay for it dearly.\n\nGiven this, their best course of action may be to forego the mortgage market\naltogether and save up enough money to buy a house in cash. If that is too\ndifficult, they could at least trying saving up a larger downpayment instead.\nRather than putting the standard 20% down, maybe they put 50% down. Anything\nthat helps them reduce the amount of money that they borrow at high rates\nwould be a win.\n\nAlternatively, they could use a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach as well. Maybe they\nstart by saving for a larger downpayment, but if rates drop to a more suitable\nlevel sooner, then they pull the trigger and buy a house.\n\nNo matter how the future plays out, being flexible with your planning can go a\nlong way in helping you make the right financial decision. And, in the event\nthat the immediate future doesn\u2019t play out in your favor, remember that\n\u201cforever\u201d isn\u2019t as long as it seems.\n\n## Forever Isn\u2019t Forever\n\nAs much as I want to go on about the woes of the Forever Renter class, they\nmay not stay as Forever Renters for all too long. The problem with a lot of\nfinancial opinions (mine included) is that they can be far too short-sighted.\nWe overindex on what\u2019s happening right now and extrapolate that out into the\nfuture. But that\u2019s almost never how the future actually turns out.\n\nJust go back in time with me five years to May 2019. Imagine all the\nforecasts, price targets, and predictions that were made in that year. How\nmany of them turned out to be right? None. Not a single one predicted what\nhappened in the next year. And I wouldn\u2019t expect them to.\n\nThe same thing will be true with regards to the U.S. housing market. Right now\nthings look bleak. The vast majority of 20 and 30 somethings can\u2019t afford a\nhome today. But this doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t be able to afford one later.\nJust look at what is happening in Austin, Texas as an example of what could\nbe. Developers started building more homes and prices have dropped by 18%\nsince May 2022. Increasing supply works. Go figure.\n\nOf course, this won\u2019t happen everywhere (for a host of reasons). But it\nillustrates how a difficult situation is unlikely to stay difficult\nindefinitely. Something\u2019s got to give. A solution will present itself. Whether\nthat solution is the one we want is another story entirely. In the meantime,\nhere are some options that can help you during your \u201cforever renter\u201d period:\n\n  * Earn more: If you feel like you will be forever priced out of the housing market, start finding ways to earn more. I know this won\u2019t help in the short run, but raising your income is the best thing you can do to improve your financial situation in the long run. If you have both Saturday and Sunday off every single week, then there is no excuse to get started on something that can eventually increase your earnings.\n  * Consider other housing arrangements: Being more open with where you live and who you live with as you wait for market conditions to improve. Living with roommates, moving to a lower cost of living area, or downsizing can help reduce your living costs temporarily as you save up to buy your desired home.\n  * Be flexible: Buying a home will likely be the biggest financial decision of your life, so don\u2019t rush into it. This is especially true in an unfavorable housing market. Be willing to adjust your timeline and keep saving until the right opportunity comes along. When things aren\u2019t looking good, being flexible enough to wait out the storm has its advantages.\n\nWhile things don\u2019t look great now, I am a firm believer that the housing\nmarket will become less daunting...eventually.
