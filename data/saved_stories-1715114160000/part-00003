Double-entry bookkeeping is a simple idea, but it\nis difficult to find a clear and concise exposition. After piecing it together\nfrom various sources, I decided to write my own explanation, one which I hope\nwill appeal to people who don't know anything about accounting, but who do\nappreciate the elegance of a well-designed system.\n\n## Using accounts to track value and flows of value\n\nFirst let me remark that everything here applies just as well to personal\nfinances as it does to the finances of an organization. You could, if you\ndesired, use double-entry bookkeeping on your personal finances. But from here\non out I'll refer to a hypothetical business.\n\nThe most critical (monetary) numbers to track in a business are:\n\n  * the value of your assets\n  * the value of your liabilities\n  * your income (in a given month, year, etc.)\n  * your expenses (in a given month, year, etc.)\n\nAssets are the things you own (cash, stock, property, etc.) or are owed (such\nas a yet-to-be-received payment for a service you have provided). Liabilities\nare commitments you have made to pay other parties. For example, in the time\nbetween purchasing a service and paying for it, you have a liability for the\namount of the bill. A loan is another type of liability.\n\nObviously your net assets and net liabilities are both defined at any given\nmoment (e.g. \"assets at midnight on January 17th\"). Income and expenses, on\nthe other hand, are defined over a period of time (\"income during the first\nweek of February\").\n\nTo track assets/liabilities and income/expenses, businesses use a system of\n\"accounts\". At any given time, each account has a balance, which starts at 0\nand changes as transactions occur. A business will generally have multiple\naccounts in each account category: for example, asset accounts might include a\nchecking account, a cash account, and an account which tracks the value of a\nbuilding it owns. Liability accounts might include an account corresponding to\nthe debt on a loan, or an account which tracks how much you currently owe a\ncertain supplier. The net assets of the business will be the sum of all the\nasset accounts. Likewise with liabilities.\n\nNote that when we use the word \"account\", we are not talking about bank\naccounts. Accounts are just records that the company keeps internally. Some of\nthose \"internal\" accounts will be set up for the purpose of tracking bank\naccounts, and thus should have basically identical entries to what the bank\nstatement says, but many of the internal accounts (like cash and physical\nproperty) have no counterpart at the bank.\n\nAlso, it may seem a little odd that income and expense accounts even exist,\nbecause the balance of these accounts doesn't \"mean\" anything. If your cash\naccount says $10, you have $10 in cash. But if your expense account says $10,\nyou don't have $10 of anything. (Instead, you have simply accumulated $10 of\nexpenses since you started keeping track.) Nonetheless, it is standard to have\nincome and expense accounts and track their value over time. Expense accounts\nsimply start at 0 and then you add to them as expenses are incurred. Likewise\nincome accounts start at 0 and become more negative as income is earned.\nYou'll soon see the virtues of this system. (Income and expense accounts do\nalso generally get reset to 0 at the end of the year. We'll explain this\nbelow.)\n\n## The chart of accounts\n\nAccountants often use the term \"chart of accounts\" to refer to a list of all\nyour accounts. They also like to number all the accounts. Here's a sample\nchart of accounts:\n\n    \n    \n    Assets Checking 101 Cash 102 Accounts Receivable Bob 103 John 104 Liabilities Mortgage 201 Accounts Payable 202 Loan from Susan 203 Income Income from painting 301 Income from woodworking 304 Expenses Paint 401 Computer equipment 402 Electricity 403 Taxes 404 Depreciation 405\n\n(In case you're not familiar with the idea of accounts receivable, it simply\nrefers to money owed to us by people who have purchased our goods or services,\nbut have not yet paid the bill.)\n\n## The key principles of accounting\n\nNow we get to the non-obvious, yet elegant, features of accounting. There are\ntwo key principles:\n\n  1. Some of your accounts have positive values, and some have negative values.\n  2. The sum of all the accounts is zero. (And if it isn't, you made a mistake somewhere.)\n\nHere are the sign conventions for accounts:\n\n    \n    \n    assets positive liabilities negative income negative expenses positive\n\nAssets and liabilities are fairly easy to understand. If you have $100 in cash\nand other assets, your asset accounts should add to $100. If you have $200 in\ntotal debt, your liability accounts should add to $-200.\n\nIncome and expenses are a little more surprising. When we earn $100 in income,\nwe decrease the corresponding income account by $100 (so that it gets more and\nmore negative over time). When we spend $100, we increase the expense account\nby $100 (so that it gets more and more positive over time). You'll see why in\na moment. You will also see in a moment why the sum of accounts is always\nzero.\n\n## The general ledger\n\nTo track activity on accounts, businesses use what is known as a \"general\nledger\". This is a table which lists all changes to the value of any account\n(going back all the way to the start of the business), along with the amount\nof the change and the date on which it occurred. All account values start at\n0, so using this table, you can sum up the appropriate entries to compute the\nvalue of any account at any time.\n\nHere's an example of the beginning of a general ledger (this is for a company\nthat opened its doors on 1/1/14).\n\n    \n    \n    |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------| | date | comments | account | delta | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------| | 1/1/14 | open checking account | | | | | | assets.checking | 300 | | | | owner equity | -300 | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------| | 1/2/14 | borrow money from susan | | | | | | liabilities.susan | -100 | | | | assets.cash | 100 | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------| | 1/3/14 | buy paint | | | | | | assets.cash | -100 | | | | expenses.paint | 100 | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------| | 1/4/14 | bill bob for painting services | | | | | | assets.receivable.bob | 2450 | | | | income.painting | -2450 | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------| | 1/5/14 | bob pays for my services | | | | | | assets.receivable.bob | -2450 | | | | assets.checking | 2450 | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------| | 1/6/14 | withdraw cash | | | | | | assets.checking | -100 | | | | assets.cash | 100 | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------| | 1/7/14 | partially repay susan | | | | | | assets.cash | -50 | | | | liabilities.susan | 50 | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------|\n\nNotice that the ledger is organized into transactions. Every transaction\naffects multiple accounts, and these effects are listed as a unit. For\nexample, if we buy something, that affects both assets and expenses. The asset\naccount decreases by some amount, and the expense account increases by the\nsame amount. (Commonly a transaction affects exactly two accounts, hence the\nterm double-entry bookkeeping.)\n\nAdding up all the entries, we obtain a value for each account as of 1/7/14:\n\n    \n    \n    assets.checking 2650 assets.receivable.bob 0 assets.cash 50 liabilities.susan -50 income.painting -2450 expenses.paint 100 owner equity -300\n\n(Don't worry about the owner equity account just yet, we'll come back to\nthat.)\n\nAgain, notice that income and liability accounts have negative values. (In\nreal life people report these numbers without the negative signs, but I'm\ngoing to leave them because it's conceptually simpler.)\n\n## The golden rule of accounting\n\nThe astute reader will notice at this point that the entries within each\ntransaction in our example add to zero, which in turn means that the sum of\nall accounts is always zero. This is the \"fundamental theorem\" or \"golden\nrule\" of accounting that we mentioned earlier: accounts add to zero. This\nprovides a useful way to check your work.\n\nWe can now see why we use negative signs for income and positive signs for\nexpenditures: it makes the accounting equation hold.\n\nAnother way to understand income and expenses is that they correspond to\nassets held by everybody in the world except you. So when you earn income, the\nnet assets of everybody else goes down, and when you spend it, it goes up.\nMoreover, the fact that accounts always add to the same value (zero) is just\nan expression of the \"conservation of money\": when you transact business,\nmoney (and other forms of value) isn't created or destroyed, it merely changes\nhands.\n\nIn terms of remembering the rules for what entries are positive and negative,\nyou can use the following mnemonic: assets and liabilities get the signs that\nseem logical. Income and expenses get the opposite.\n\n## Owner equity\n\nNow we can explain the \"owner equity\" account as well. When the company gets\nstarted, the owner equity account represents how much of his own money the\nowner has put into the company. (And if there are multiple owners, there are\nseparate owner equity accounts which reflect how much each contributed.)\n\nSince the company (in principle) \"owes\" the owner their investment back, owner\nequity is a form of liability, and thus it gets a negative sign.\n\nSo when an owner opens a checking account for his new business (using $300 of\nhis personal assets), the owner equity account now has -$300: that reflects\nhis stake in the business.\n\nThe owner can also take money out of the company at any time (seeing as how he\nowns it, he is entitled to do this). For example, if he takes $200 out, the\naccounts change like so:\n\n    \n    \n    before after ---------------------------------------------------------- assets of company 300 100 owner equity -300 -100\n\nOne purpose that is served by introducing the owner equity account is that it\nenables the sum of all accounts to be 0; without it, any time an owner\ninvested money in the business, or took money out, the sum of accounts would\nchange.\n\nAs the business conducts business, it hopefully earns a profit. As accounting\nentries get made, you can see that the \"net profit so far\" ends up\naccumulating in the income and expense accounts:\n\n> net profit so far = sum of income and expense accounts\n\nBecause the owner is entitled to this profit, it then makes sense to shift\nmoney from the income/expense accounts to the owner equity account. This is\ndone typically at the end of the year using something called \"closing entries\"\nwhich will be discussed in a moment. After closing entries for a given year\nare made, the owner equity account then reflects not how much the owner put in\nto the company, but how much he is now entitled to take out of the company, if\nhe wishes.\n\nBefore we discuss these closing entries, let us cover one more topic.\n\n## Credit and debit columns\n\nOne thing we glossed over when presenting the general ledger was the \"debit\"\nand \"credit\" columns. It is standard practice in accounting to write numbers\nin two columns (debit and credit), instead of just a single \"delta\" column.\nPositive numbers go in the debit column, negative in the credit column (but\nwithout the negative sign). This is basically done for readability, as far as\nI can tell. Here is how our ledger looks when we obey this convention:\n\n    \n    \n    |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | date | comments | account | debit | credit | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/1/14 | open checking account | | | | | | | assets.checking | 300 | | | | | owner equity | | 300 | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/2/14 | borrow money from susan | | | | | | | liabilities.susan | | 100 | | | | assets.cash | 100 | | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/3/14 | buy paint | | | | | | | assets.cash | | 100 | | | | expenses.paint | 100 | | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/4/14 | bill bob for painting services | | | | | | | assets.receivable.bob | 2450 | | | | | income.painting | | 2450 | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/5/14 | bob pays for my services | | | | | | | assets.receivable.bob | | 2450 | | | | assets.checking | 2450 | | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/6/14 | withdraw cash | | | | | | | assets.checking | | 100 | | | | assets.cash | 100 | | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/7/14 | partially repay susan | | | | | | | assets.cash | | 50 | | | | liabilities.susan | 50 | | |--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------|\n\n## Closing entries\n\nIt may seem a bit odd to have \"income\" accounts which just get more and more\nnegative forever, and \"expenses\" accounts which just grow forever. Accountants\napparently agree, and so the convention is to prevent this by resetting them\nto zero each year. This is done by making so-called \"closing entries\" in the\nentry at the end of each year. Closing entries do not reflect any actual\ntransaction, but simply help to keep the books organized.\n\nIn addition to resetting income and expense accounts to zero, closing entries\nshift profit to the owner equity account, so that the owner equity account\nthen represents the true value of the business (or equivalently, how much\nmoney the owner is entitled to take out of the business, should he choose to\ndo so).\n\nClosing entries have several other nice effects. First, since income and\nexpense accounts are reset to zero each year, this means that they always\nreflect year-to-date income and expenses. Second, you can determine from the\nclosing entry what the year's income and expenses were. And finally, as you\nwould expect, closing entries obey the same accounting equation that every\nother entry does. An example of closing entries is shown below (our business\napparently didn't do anything between 1/7 and 12/31).\n\n    \n    \n    |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | date | comments | account | debit | credit | |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/1/14 | open checking account | | | | | | | assets.checking | 300 | | | | | owner equity | | 300 | |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/2/14 | borrow money from susan | | | | | | | liabilities.susan | | 100 | | | | assets.cash | 100 | | |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/3/14 | buy paint | | | | | | | assets.cash | | 100 | | | | expenses.paint | 100 | | |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/4/14 | bill bob for painting services | | | | | | | assets.receivable.bob | 2450 | | | | | income.painting | | 2450 | |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/5/14 | bob pays for my services | | | | | | | assets.receivable.bob | | 2450 | | | | assets.checking | 2450 | | |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/6/14 | withdraw cash | | | | | | | assets.checking | | 100 | | | | assets.cash | 100 | | |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 1/7/14 | partially repay susan | | | | | | | assets.cash | | 50 | | | | liabilities.susan | 50 | | |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------| | 12/31/14 | closing entries | | | | | | | income.painting | 2450 | | | | | expenses.paint | | 100 | | | | owner equity | | 2350 | |----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+--------|\n\nAfter this closing entry, the net values in our accounts are\n\n    \n    \n    assets.checking 2650 assets.receivable.bob 0 assets.cash 50 liabilities.susan -50 income.painting 0 expenses.paint 0 owner equity -2650\n\nNote how income and expenses have become zero, and the owner equity account\nreflects the true value of the business.\n\n## Posting\n\nIn the olden days it was standard practice to keep separate documents, one per\naccount, which listed the transactions affecting that account. (Pretty much in\nthe format you see on your bank statement.) These documents were prepared by\nmanually copying entries out of the general ledger, so that the general ledger\nwas always the primary, \"authoritative\" source of information. (This process\nwas called \"posting.\") Computers have made the manual posting process\nunnecessary, obviously, and accounting software will generate an account-\nspecific view on demand.\n\n## What's the point of double-entry?\n\nDouble-entry accounting follows from a few simple principles. First, there is\nthe fairly obvious principle that you should know what you have, what you owe,\nwhere your money comes from, and where it goes. This leads to maintaining\naccounts for assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Furthermore, it makes\nsense to introduce an owner equity account (or accounts, if there are multiple\nowners) to track how much the owner(s) have invested in the company.\n\nAll of these accounts then change over time. It's natural to group related\nchanges into transactions, and have a master list of such transactions. This\ngives us the general ledger: a single, authoritative, append-only record of a\ncompany's financial state.\n\nMoreover, by choosing the positive and negative signs right, we can get the\nsum of all accounts to be zero, and the sum within each transaction to be\nzero, providing a useful way to check our work. Moreover, we can be assured we\nwill keep an accurate tally of expenses (important for tax purposes,\nobviously): to keep our general ledger in sync with our bank statements, we\nare forced to note every outflow of money, and the corresponding ledger\nentries won't balance unless we also note an expense.\n\n## More reading\n\nFor another hacker's perspective on accounting, you might be interested in\nthis article by Martin Kleppmann.\n\n\u00a9 2015-2024 Sean Markan - sean.markan@gmail.com\n\n", "frontpage": false}
