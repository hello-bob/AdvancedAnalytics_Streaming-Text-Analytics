World\n\nAUSTIN, TEXAS \u2014 Adam Sullivan left investment banking to mine bitcoin at an\nawkward time. It was May 2023, bitcoin was trading at around $21,000, U.S.\nregulators were in the thick of cracking down on the sector writ large, and\nCore Scientific, the company he had agreed to take over, was battling angry\nlenders in a Texas bankruptcy court over tens of millions of dollars in\noutstanding debt.\n\nBut Sullivan knew that, with a lifeline, he could get the business to a much\nbetter place. That\u2019s because the halving was on the way, and with it would\nlikely come a big rally in bitcoin.\n\nLate Friday night, the bitcoin code automatically cut new issuance of the\nworld\u2019s largest cryptocurrency in half. It happens roughly every four years,\nand in addition to helping to stave off inflation, it historically precedes a\nmajor run-up in the price of bitcoin.\n\nThe technical event is relatively simple: Bitcoin miners get paid in bitcoin\nto validate transactions, and after 210,000 blocks of transactions are\ncomputed and added to the main chain, the reward given to the miners securing\nbitcoin is \u2018halved.\u2019\n\nThere are more than a dozen publicly traded miners on the network and\nthousands of smaller, private ones around the globe, constantly racing to\nprocess transactions and get paid in new bitcoin. Because the event leads to a\ncut to rewards paid to miners directly, they\u2019ll be the first ones to feel the\nimpact of the halving.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has touched new all-time highs after each \u201chalving\u201d\nevent.\n\nCNBC\n\nTypically, when the halving cuts supply, it\u2019s led to huge rallies for bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, the previous (and only) three halvings in the chain\u2019s history have\ncome before every bull run, in which the coin has touched new all-time highs\nand a surge of investors have entered the market for the first time.\n\nThat rapid price increase has helped many miners stave off the worst since it\ntends to offset the impact of having the block prize cut in half.\n\n\u201cAs a company that was already in the process of scaling our infrastructure\nduring the previous halving, we know the toll that halvings can take on a\ncompany if it is not adequately prepared,\u201d Core\u2019s Sullivan told CNBC.\n\nThe aggregate market cap of the 14 U.S.-listed bitcoin miners tracked by\nJPMorgan analysts, which accounts for around 21% of the global Bitcoin\nnetwork, declined 28% over the first half of April to $14.2 billion, reaching\nyear-to-date lows. Bitdeer was the best-performing stock over the period, down\naround 20%, versus Stronghold Digital, which was 46% lower.\n\nSome have billed the 2024 bitcoin halving as a seminal moment for the mining\nsector. Depending on how much prep work miners have done, it could easily make\nor break them.\n\n\u201cBeing prepared for a halving means evaluating all of your power strategies,\nall of your software capabilities, all of your operations,\u201d continued\nSullivan.\n\nOthers are less concerned given recent price moves in bitcoin.\n\nIn a research note from Needham on Apr. 16, analysts said they expect the\nhalving to only have a modest impact to miners\u2019 estimated EBITDA margins,\ndespite the 50% reduction in revenue, since the price of bitcoin has been\ntrading in the range of $60,000 to $70,000.\n\n\u201cWe expect geopolitical tensions and interest rate policy to be the biggest\nnear-term drivers of crypto price action,\u201d Needham analysts wrote, adding that\nat a bitcoin price above $60,000, the halving is \u201cderisked for nearly all\npublic miners.\u201d\n\nThe bank did, however, single out their preference for low-cost bitcoin\nproducers like Riot Platforms, Bitdeer, and Cipher Mining. Meanwhile, if\nbitcoin prices fall, Needham says the most outsized native impact will be felt\nby higher cost producers that are also levered to higher bitcoin prices via\nlarge treasury holdings.\n\nAnalysts from JPMorgan echoed a similar sentiment, writing in an Apr. 16\nresearch note that they think \u201crecent weakness offers an attractive entry\npoint\u201d for investors and that they are \u201cespecially bullish\u201d on Riot, which\nthey believe offers attractive relative valuations.\n\nPower supply for Whinstone\u2019s bitcoin mine in Rockdale, Texas.\n\n## Years spent bracing for the halving\n\nMiners have had years to prepare for the halving, including seeking lower\npower costs and upgrading their fleets to more efficient machines.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s halving happens like clockwork every four years,\u201d said Haris Basit,\nchief strategy officer of Bitdeer Technologies Group. \u201cIt\u2019s a known variable\nthat is a benchmark for us to remain focused on operational excellence.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the Singapore-headquartered mining firm has invested in new data\ncenters, but its core strategy has been to increase vertical integration\nthrough research and development. 25% of its staff is focused on R&D efforts,\nwhich Basit says have \u201cled to new innovations and revenue pathways, such as\nour recently announced 4nm mining rigs and AI Cloud offerings.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald recently named Bitdeer as having one of the\nindustry\u2019s lowest \u201call-in\u201d cost-per-coin.\n\nGreg Beard, the CEO and Chairman of Stronghold Digital Mining, tells CNBC that\nminers whose only lever is more efficient machines will be at a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cMiners who own their low-cost power are better positioned,\u201d said Beard.\n\u201cOperational costs will be lower, allowing them to be more flexible with their\ncapital.\u201d\n\nCore\u2019s Sullivan agrees, noting that bitcoin mining data centers in the future\nwill work hand-in-glove with power generators and grid operators to serve as a\nvirtual battery for grid operators \u2013 allowing them to increase base load,\ncurtail bitcoin data centers when they need to, and avoid peak generation\nloads, which he says are dirty and expensive.\n\n\u201cWe own and operate our infrastructure, giving us greater control over\noperational and strategic decisions, such as the potential to expand into\nhigh-performance computing hosting,\u201d said Sullivan.\n\nCore Scientific, which launched in 2017 and now manages seven mining sites in\nfive U.S. states, also owns the full technology stack. The company has been\nlooking to diversify its revenue streams beyond purely bitcoin. Sullivan says\nthat existing data centers offer reconfiguration opportunities to accommodate\nnew types of high-value compute.\n\n\u201cCertain data centers are located in close proximity to major metropolitan\nareas, making them candidates for low-latency, high-value compute\napplications,\u201d said Core\u2019s CEO.\n\nBitdeer\u2019s bitcoin mine in Rockdale, Texas.\n\nRiot Platforms CEO Jason Les told CNBC that preparation for the halving came\ndown to the company\u2019s long-standing focus on achieving a low cost of power,\nstrong balance sheet, and significant scale of operations. Les says that\u2019s\nwhat has positioned the firm to both withstand the halving with positive\nmargins and be well positioned for upside on the other side of it.\n\n\u201cOur new Corsicana Facility was energized just this week, and we will be\nsignificantly scaling up our hash rate with next-generation equipment at that\nnew site over the remainder of the year,\u201d said Les. \u201cAs a result, we are\npositioned to mine more bitcoin per day at the end of the year than we do\ntoday, despite the halving.\u201d\n\nMarathon Digital, which has seen its stock rise more than 70% in the last\nyear, took a different approach to scaling the business than its rivals. CEO\nFred Thiel tells CNBC that the company grew quickly using an asset-light\napproach, where Capex was spent on mining rigs rather than infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIn December, we owned less than 5% of the sites where we were hosting our\nminers,\u201d said Thiel. \u201cToday we now own 53% of our total 1.1 gigawatts of\ncapacity, having purchased it at less than the build and replacement cost.\u201d\n\nOwning sites lowers Marathon\u2019s cost to mine by up to 20% on a marginal cost\nbasis. Thiel also noted that by the end of 2024, Marathon expects to further\nimprove efficiency by 10% to 15% as they deploy the next generation rigs\nacross their new sites.\n\nThat boost to efficiency isn\u2019t just about new gear, however. The firm is\ndeploying its own custom firmware, which allows it to operate even more\nefficiently.\n\nMarathon, along with other mining firms, has begun diversifying its business\nmodel into ancillary operations beyond purely bitcoin mining, as well.\n\nThiel says the company recently launched an energy harvesting division, where\nthey are compensated for converting stranded methane and bio-mass into energy,\nwhich they then sell heat back into an industrial or commercial process. The\nservice essentially subsidizes and lowers Marathon\u2019s cost to mine\nsignificantly. The company expects this new business line to generate a\nsignificant portion of its revenues by the halving in 2028.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:0602:06\n\nBlockstream\u2019s Adam Back on teaming up with Tesla and Block to mine bitcoin\nwith solar power\n\nCrypto World\n\n## Diversifying revenue\n\nThe April 2024 bitcoin halving looks a lot different than the three that came\nbefore it.\n\nFor years, increased competition resulting from new miners coming online has\nbeen cutting into profits, because more miners means more people are sharing\nthe same pool of rewards.\n\nIn a research note from JPMorgan on Apr. 16, analysts note that the network\nhashrate, a proxy for industry competition and mining difficulty, was up 4% in\nApril from the month before. Stronghold\u2019s Beard says the halving is a headwind\ndwarfed by the global hashrate increasing nearly five-fold from the last one\nin May 2020.\n\n\u201cMining is a tough industry especially because there are a lot of nation\nstates that have extra power power and they\u2019re dedicating it to mining,\u201d said\nNic Carter of Castle Island Ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s a free market, anybody can enter\ninto it as long as they have the basics.\u201d\n\nU.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have also significantly shifted the\npricing dynamics. In years past, the price of bitcoin didn\u2019t surge until after\nthe halving. But in the wake of record flows into these spot bitcoin funds,\nthe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency touched a fresh all-time-high above $73,000\nin March.\n\n\u201cThe recently approved bitcoin ETFs have proven to be huge pipelines of\ncapital into bitcoin and that universe of ETFs continues to grow with the\nrecent approvals in Hong Kong as well,\u201d said Riot\u2019s Les. \u201cWe think the price\naction we\u2019ve seen in bitcoin year-to-date reflect that and has us very\noptimistic on what bitcoin mining economics can look like in the months and\nyears post-halving.\u201d\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO3:0703:07\n\nBitcoin resumes rally after hitting a new all-time high\n\nWorldwide Exchange\n\nBlackrock\u2019s ETF reached $17 billion in net assets within a few months of\nlaunching. Beard of Stronghold tells CNBC that if Blackrock added even just a\nbillion dollars more of bitcoin in April to its ETF, it would single handedly\ncreate demand for more coins than the mining industry will supply post\nhalving.\n\nWhat is also different this time around is that the block reward is no longer\nthe primary form of miner revenue. Recent programming innovations in bitcoin\nhave given way to a burgeoning ecosystem of projects building on top of\nbitcoin\u2019s blockchain, which has translated to greater transaction fee revenue\nfor miners.\n\nThere is a limit to how large the blocks can go but the value of those blocks\nis about to increase significantly, according to Bill Barhydt, who is the CEO\nand founder of Abra. From Barhydt\u2019s vantage point, he supports miners with a\nmix of services, including their auto liquidations, so he has access to a lot\nof macro data across the sector.\n\n\u201cThe math is simple,\u201d begins Barhydt. \u201cBitcoin blocks are fixed in size and\nthe demand for data within those blocks is going to increase significantly for\nseveral reasons, including more retail wallet holders moving their bitcoin\ninto and out of storage, new uses cases like Ordinals (NFTs for bitcoin) and\nDeFi on bitcoin, institutional settlement requirements for exchange traded\nproducts in the U.S., Hong Kong, Europe, etc., lightning settlement\ntransactions, and more.\u201d\n\nAt the current rate of adoption, Barhydt believes that transaction fees in\nthis cycle would likely peak within 24 months at 10 times their cost during\nthe previous cycle peak, due to a combination of a higher price for bitcoin\nitself, combined with higher demand for the space inside each block.\n\nCastle Island\u2019s Carter isn\u2019t so sure that fee-based revenue can completely\nmake up for lost income post-halving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely clear that fees are fully offsetting the lost revenue, and\nin fact, I don\u2019t expect that to happen\u201d said Carter.\n\nFees tend to be really cyclical. They rise sharply during periods of\ncongestion, and they fall back to near zero during other normal periods.\nCarter cautions that miners will see spikes in fees, but there is not yet an\nenduring, strong, and robust fee market most of the time.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:4304:43\n\nJack Dorsey backed start-up taps into geothermal, hydro and solar power to run\nbitcoin mines across Africa\n\nCrypto World\n\n## Swapping ASICs for AI\n\nIn the last year, there has been a surge in demand for AI compute and\ninfrastructure that can support the massive workloads required to power these\nnovel machine learning applications. In a new report, digital asset fund\nmanager CoinShares says it expects to see more miners shift toward artificial\nintelligence in energy-secure locations because of the potential for higher\nrevenues.\n\nAlready, mining firms like BitDigital, Hive, Hut 8, Terawfulf, and Core\nScientific all have either current AI operations or AI growth plans.\n\n\u201cThis trend suggests that bitcoin mining may increasingly move to stranded\nenergy sites while investment in AI grows at more stable locations,\u201d write\nanalysts at CoinShares.\n\nBut pivoting from bitcoin mining to AI isn\u2019t as simple as re-purposing\nexisting infrastructure and machines. The data center requirements are\ndifferent, as are the data network needs.\n\n\u201cAI presents several challenges, notably the need for distinct and\nconsiderably more costly infrastructure, which establishes barriers to entry\nfor smaller, less capitalized entities,\u201d continues the report. \u201cAdditionally,\nthe necessity for a different skill set among employees leads to increased\ncosts as companies hire more AI-skilled talent.\u201d\n\nThe rigs used to mine bitcoin are called ASICs, short for Application-Specific\nIntegrated Circuits. The \u201cSpecific\u201d in that acronym means that it can\u2019t be\nused to do other things, like supporting the underlying infrastructure for AI.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a bitcoin miner, your machines can\u2019t be repurposed,\u201d explains\nCarter. \u201cYou have to buy net new machines in order to do it and the data\ncenter requirements are different for AI versus bitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nSullivan says that Core Scientific, which has been mining a mix of digital\nassets since 2017, began to diversify into other services in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe company has owned and hosted Nvidia DGX systems and GPUs for AI\ncomputing, having built and deployed a specialized facility specifically for\nhigh-value compute applications at our Dalton, Georgia data center campus,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nCore Scientific has also partnered with CoreWeave, a cloud provider which\nprovides infrastructure for use cases like machine learning.\n\nSullivan says the combined capabilities will support both AI and High\nPerformance Compute workloads, resulting in an estimated revenue of $100\nmillion, though he says the total potential revenue is much higher given their\nsignificant infrastructure footprint that can be fitted to host some of the\nmost advanced GPU compute coming to market.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is an early example of high-value compute, attracting\nsignificant capital and a number of companies scaling their operations to\nsupport the Bitcoin network,\u201d said Sullivan.\n\nBut Sullivan thinks few operators will be able to make the transition to AI.\n\nSullivan continued, \u201cBitcoin mining sites can only be repurposed if they meet\nthe attributes that are required for HPC. Many existing sites across North\nAmerica do not meet these needs.\u201d\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:3402:34\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF decision: First trades expected after SEC grants approvals\n\nWorldwide Exchange\n\n## More In Crypto World\n\nwatch now\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO08:53\n\nBitcoin rises to $64,000 in the final hours before the halving: CNBC Crypto\nWorld\n\nJordan Smith\n\nCrypto prices gain to start the week following first Bitcoin halving since\n2020\n\nTanaya Macheel17 min ago\n\nHow a Jack Dorsey-backed bitcoin miner uses a volcano in Kenya to turn on the\nlights in rural homes\n\nMacKenzie Sigalos\n\nRead More\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
