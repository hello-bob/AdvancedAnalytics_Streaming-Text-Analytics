Several technologies could help to meet this need.\n\nBut which approaches could be viable on a commercial scale?\n\nToronto-based Hydrostor Inc. is one of the businesses developing long-duration\nenergy storage that has moved beyond lab scale and is now focusing on building\nbig things. The company makes systems that store energy underground in the\nform of compressed air, which can be released to produce electricity for eight\nhours or longer.\n\n### We\u2019re hiring!\n\nPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.\n\nSee jobs\n\nI spoke with Curtis VanWalleghem, Hydrostor\u2019s CEO and co-founder, to get an\nupdate on how close he is to breaking ground on large plants in Australia and\nCalifornia and to learn how he makes the case for his company.\n\nHe emphasizes the simplicity of his product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple system that just uses a hole in rock [plus] air and\nwater,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the equipment is all from the oil and gas industry,\nso you don\u2019t need new manufacturing or anything.\u201d\n\nSome background on why long-duration storage matters: The grid of the near\nfuture will require a mix of energy storage resources to fill gaps when there\nare lulls in generation from wind and solar. Most lithium-ion battery systems\nrun for a maximum of four hours. Energy system planners have said the grid\nwill also need storage options that can run six, eight and 12 hours, and some\nthat last as long as a day or more.\n\nThe Department of Energy has identified the need for long-duration storage as\nan essential part of fully decarbonizing the electricity system, and, in 2021,\nset a goal that research, development and investment would help to reduce the\ncosts of the technologies by 90 percent in a decade.\n\nA variety of companies and technologies are competing for a share of the\nmarket. This includes several types of long-duration batteries, and some\nresources that have been around for a while, such as pumped hydro storage at\nhydroelectric dams.\n\nHydrostor\u2019s first large project to go online is likely going to be Silver City\nEnergy Storage Centre in Australia, which will have the ability to discharge\nat 200 megawatts for up to eight hours. Construction should begin around the\nend of 2024 and the plant should be running by mid-2027, VanWalleghem said.\n\nThe next project would be Willow Rock Energy Storage Center, located near\nRosamond in Kern County, California, with a capacity of 500 megawatts and the\nability to run at that level for eight hours. Hydrostor is aiming to begin\nconstruction by late next year and have it running before 2030. But before\nthat, the company needs to get a permit from the California Energy Commission,\na process that has restarted after a brief pause.\n\nUnlike some other long-duration storage companies, Hydrostor has proven its\ntechnology. The company has operated a small, 1.75-megawatt plant in Goderich,\nOntario, since 2019, which can run for about six hours at a time. Compressed-\nair storage existed before Hydrostor\u2014plants in Germany and Alabama have been\naround for decades and use variations on this approach.\n\nHydrostor\u2019s system uses a supersize air compressor that ideally would run on\nrenewable electricity. The system draws air from the environment, compressing\nit and moving it through a pipe into a cavern more than 1,000 feet\nunderground. The process of compressing the air produces heat, and the system\nextracts heat from the air and stores it above ground for reuse. As the air\ngoes underground, it displaces water from the cavern up a shaft into a\nreservoir.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to discharge energy, the system releases water into the cavern,\nforcing the air to the surface. The air then mixes with heat that the plant\nstored when the air was compressing, and this hot, dense air passes through a\nturbine to make electricity.\n\nThe long-term viability of the technology will be closely tied to how its cost\ncompares to other types of long-duration storage. The California plant has a\nprojected cost of about $1.5 billion, which would make it competitive with\npumped hydro and other available options. The users of the plant\u2019s services\nwould include Central Coast Community Energy, a nonprofit power provider based\nin Monterey.\n\nVanWalleghem said there is room to push costs down as the company gains\nexperience from these first few plants. The storage systems have a projected\nlifespan of about 50 years, which is an important data point when comparing it\nto battery systems, which have much shorter lives, he said.\n\nYiyi Zhou, an analyst for BloombergNEF, said Hydrostor is one of about 100\ncompanies that focus, at least in part, on developing long-duration energy\nstorage.\n\nHydrostor stands out, she said, because its technology is \u201crelatively mature\u201d\nand the company has also been one of the most successful in the space at\nraising money from investors.\n\nBloombergNEF reported a global total of 1.4 gigawatts and 8.2 gigawatt-hours\nof long-duration energy storage as of last September, excluding pumped hydro.\nThe average duration, which you can calculate by dividing gigawatt-hours by\ngigawatts, was 5.9 hours.\n\nFor perspective, the two Hydrostor projects being developed have a combined\ncapacity of 0.9 gigawatts, more than half of the global total now online.\n\nFor this year and next, the long-duration storage technologies likely to see\nthe fastest adoption are compressed air storage and flow batteries, according\nto BloombergNEF. (I wrote an explainer on flow batteries in 2022.)\n\nI find it challenging to get my arms around this part of the clean energy\neconomy because of the large gap between what\u2019s been developed and what\u2019s in\nsome stage of planning. There are many opportunities for projects to sputter\nand die along the way.\n\nWith this in mind, I\u2019ll be watching to see whether Hydrostor is able to begin\nconstruction on schedule in Australia and whether it can navigate the\nregulatory approval process for the plant in California.\n\nThe California project has gone through some big changes. At one point,\nHydrostor had two proposals in the state, but dropped one because of\nchallenges in the permitting process, including some issues with building in a\nlocation overseen by the California Coastal Commission. The remaining project,\nWillow Rock, has also gone through changes to the design and the location in\nresponse to feedback from the local community and from regulators.\n\n### This story is funded by readers like you.\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge\nand advertising.

The review process\nbegan again in March and could be complete as soon as this time next year.\n\nOne of the factors to keep in mind is that California\u2019s state government and\nthe California Energy Commission have made clear that they want to build long-\nduration energy storage. The state has estimated that it will need 4 gigawatts\nof long term energy storage capacity to be able to meet the goal of 100\npercent clean electricity by 2045.\n\nHydrostor and state officials want to see this project get up and running. If\nthat happens, it could provide a showpiece to make the case for building many\nothers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just looking forward to the growth, just getting these projects\nconstructed and then start doing more, five, 10 projects at a time,\u201d\nVanWalleghem said.\n\nOther stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:\n\nPower Plant Pollution Targeted in Sweeping Actions by Biden Administration:\nThe Biden administration finalized a sweeping set of regulations for power\nplants. The rules offer plenty of exemptions, much leeway and additional time\nfor industry to comply, as my colleague Marianne Lavelle reports. Power plant\noperators need to meet a carbon dioxide limit equal to the reduction of\ninstalling a carbon capture system and running it at 90 percent efficiency.\nPlant operators have until 2032 to comply, two more years than previously\nplanned. The rules face pushback from some state officials who are closely\nallied with fossil fuel companies, including West Virginia Attorney General\nDaniel Morrissey, who said he will fight back against \u201cBiden\u2019s anti-energy\nagenda.\u201d\n\nBiden Administration Moves to Speed up Permits for Clean Energy: The Biden\nadministration released rules designed to streamline permits for clean energy\nprojects while also requiring federal agencies to more heavily weigh the\neffects of climate change on low-income communities before approving projects\nlike oil wells, as Coral Davenport reports for the New York Times. The rules\nwould allow projects with a long-term environmental benefit to receive\nexpedited environmental reviews.\n\nTesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market: Tesla has laid off\nalmost everyone in its Supercharger organization, a group of nearly 500\nemployees that has built a vast network of EV charging stations, as Dana Hull,\nEdward Ludlow and Keith Naughton report for Bloomberg. The decision shocked\nthe auto industry at a time when nearly every major automaker is in the\nprocess of adopting a charging system compatible with Tesla\u2019s network. The\ncuts include Rebecca Tinucci, who was senior director of the Supercharger\ngroup and was a key figure in Tesla\u2019s dominance of charging infrastructure.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said the company still plans to grow the charging network,\njust at a slower pace for new locations.\n\nAssessing the Future of U.S. Nuclear Power After Vogtle: The final new reactor\nat Plant Vogtle in Georgia has begun sending electricity to the grid, marking\nthe completion of a project that was long delayed and vastly over budget to\nthe point that nobody else in the United States wants to build a similar large\nplant, as Zach Bright reports for E&E News. The nuclear industry has shifted\nto focus on developing small, modular reactors, but this technology has yet to\nbe deployed on a commercial scale.\n\nWill There Be Less Wind to Fuel Wind Energy? Wind energy generation declined\nlast year across the country, including in Illinois, largely due to weather\nfactors that reduced wind speeds. Researchers are trying to determine whether\nclimate change is contributing to the decrease in wind speeds, as Brett Chase\nof the Chicago Sun-Times and I report. It is not new to see variations in wind\nspeeds from year to year, but this becomes a greater concern for the\nelectricity grid as it relies more on renewable sources of electricity.\n\nInside Clean Energy is ICN\u2019s weekly bulletin of news and analysis about the\nenergy transition.
