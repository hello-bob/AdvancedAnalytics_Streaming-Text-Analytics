It is named after the media and market\nresearcher Tony Twyman and has been described as one of the most important\nlaws of data analysis.^[2]^[3]^[4]\n\nThe law is based on the fact that errors in data measurement and analysis can\nlead to observed quantities that are wildly different from typical values.\nThese errors are usually more common than real changes of similar magnitude in\nthe underlying process being measured. For example, if an analyst at a\nsoftware company notices that the number of users has doubled overnight, the\nmost likely explanation is a bug in logging, rather than a true increase in\nusers.^[3]\n\nThe law can also be extended to situations where the underlying data is\ninfluenced by unexpected factors that differ from what was intended to be\nmeasured. For example, when schools show unusually large improvements in test\nscores, subsequent investigation often reveals that those scores were driven\nby fraud.^[5]^[6]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Sagan standard\n  * Zebra (medicine)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Kohavi, Ron. \"Twyman's Law and Controlled Experiments\" (PDF).
