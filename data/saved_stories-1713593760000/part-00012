By recognizing\nthe relationships between these modalities \u2014 images and video, audio, text,\ndepth, thermal and inertial measurement units (IMUs) \u2014 this breakthrough helps\nadvance AI by enabling machines to better analyze many different forms of\ninformation, together.\n\nExplore the demo to see ImageBind's capabilities across image, audio and text\nmodalities.\n\nSee its capabilities\n\nMultimodal AI\n\n### One embedding to bind them all\n\nFor humans, a single image can \u2018bind\u2019 together an entire sensory experience.\nImageBind achieves this by learning a single embedding space that binds\nmultiple sensory inputs together \u2014 without the need for explicit supervision.\nIt can even upgrade existing AI models to support input from any of the six\nmodalities, enabling audio-based search, cross-modal search, multimodal\narithmetic, and cross-modal generation.\n\nRead the blog post\n\nEmergent recognition performance\n\n### Enabling zero-shot and few-shot recognition\n\nThe open source ImageBind model achieves a new SOTA performance on emergent\nzero-shot recognition tasks across modalities \u2014 even better than prior\nspecialist models trained specifically for those modalities.\n\nRead the paper\n\n\u00a9 2023 Meta\n\nTerms of Service\n\n", "frontpage": false}
