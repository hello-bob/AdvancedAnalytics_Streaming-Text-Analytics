The plan had been known for some time and at least two,\nmostly complete backups, have been acquired by separate archiving teams. A\n90GB torrent is currently being shared all over the world, but for\ninternational movie and TV show app users that rely on Subscene for subtitles,\nchaos may prevail for a while.\n\nAfter two decades online and maybe even a few more under Divxstation branding\nright at the beginning, veteran subtitle download site Subscene.com has\nfinally thrown in the towel.\n\nIn various guises, linked to specific geographic regions, perhaps as many as\n50 domains can be linked to Subscene over the past twenty years. At a time\nwhen legal streaming services didn\u2019t even exist, Subscene offered subtitles\nfor large libraries of movies and TV shows in multiple languages.\n\nMaking content accessible to non-native speakers, in countries where legal\nstreaming services wouldn\u2019t arrive for a decade, didn\u2019t just help people to\nunderstand movies. For those hoping to widen their horizons, subtitles became\nopportunities to learn new languages. For the deaf and hard of hearing,\nsubtitles represented a new connection with the wider world.\n\n## Competition \u2013 Finally\n\nThings are, of course, very different today. While a disappointing number of\nlegal streaming platforms still fail to provide acceptable subtitles on all\ncontent, Netflix releases often arrive with subtitles in dozens of languages.\nThat seems likely to have played a part in reduced levels of traffic at\nSubscene, leading to a fairly quiet announcement two months ago.\n\n\u201cHi everyone, i\u2019m very sorry to be [writing] this, but Subscene cannot\ncontinue for much longer,\u201d the site\u2019s owner told users.\n\n\u201cIt has not been paying for itself for several years now, visitors are\nfalling, and maintenance cannot continue. I am amazed at all your\nadministrative work with the content which is the primary reason that I have\ncontinued paying for the site for this long. Thank you all for this journey we\nhave been on together. If I can do anything for you let me know.\u201d\n\n## Shutdown in 24 Hours\n\nOn May 2, 2024, Subscene\u2019s owner posted to the site\u2019s forum to confirm what\nhad been mentioned at least eight weeks earlier. Subscene would be shutting\ndown for good.\n\nSome Subscene users complained that 24 hours wasn\u2019t enough time to back up\nsubtitles they had uploaded to the site. Others expressed concerns that a\ngiant subtitle collection shouldn\u2019t just disappear without an effort to\npreserve it. The reality is that efforts to preserve the contents of Subscene\nhad been underway for some time.\n\n## Archiving, Hoarding Data\n\nSoon after the first announcement two months ago, indicating that Subscene\nwould close down, members of the /r/DataHoarder subreddit had quickly sprung\ninto action. They produced a full 90GB+ database, which they say even includes\ndeleted subtitle files, and then made it available online via a regular\n.torrent file, a magnet link, and for the Usenet fans, an NZB file.\n\nAs mentioned on their Wiki, Archive Team sprang into action with the 24-hour\nshutdown period underway yet still managed to retrieve almost everything.\n\n\u201cIt was announced on 2024-05-02 that the site would cease operations within 24\nhours, and that a \u2018takeover plan was not possible\u2019. No reason was given for\nthe sudden closure. A DPoS project was started 2024-05-03 13:56 UTC and was\nable to grab most subtitles before the websites demise later that day at\n2024-05-03 21:11 UTC.\u201d\n\n## Data Saved But in The Wrong Place for App Users\n\nUsers who prefer to use mostly Android apps for their movie and TV show fix,\noften have in-app access to subtitles. As the image below shows, Subscene.com\nis regularly used as a source for those subtitles.\n\nSince the site\u2019s URL appears to be hardcoded in many cases, only an app update\nwill be able to point to a new location. Even then, open access to the files\nisn\u2019t guaranteed and will only become more complex if there\u2019s not enough\ncentralized interest in creating or curating new subtitles for the latest\ntitles.\n\nThere\u2019s no suggestion from the site\u2019s operator that Subscene has faced recent\nlegal issues but nevertheless, blocking injunctions and personalized mentions\nin industry reports to government have played a part in the site\u2019s history.\n\nAccording to a message on the site\u2019s main page, that history ends here.\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * apps\n  * subscene\n  * subtitles\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### LaLiga \u201cTalks to Google\u201d About Deleting Piracy Apps From a Million Phones\n\n  * September 24, 2023, 19:20 by Andy Maxwell\n\nPiracy\n\n### Are Pirate Streaming Apps Dangerous?
