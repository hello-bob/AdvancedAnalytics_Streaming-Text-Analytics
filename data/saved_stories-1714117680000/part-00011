Its\ncloud computing revenue surged by more than 20%.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI tools \u201care orchestrating a new era of AI transformation,\ndriving better business outcomes across every role and industry,\u201d said Satya\nNadella, the chief executive of Microsoft.\n\nAs the group races to integrate AI across its software and services, Nadella\nsaid its Azure cloud computing business saw the pace of deals worth $100m and\n$10m increase by double-digit percentages. It has also started selling its\nCopilot AI software add-on to small businesses.\n\nTotal revenue at Microsoft increased 17% to $61.86bn during the first three\nmonths of 2024, the third quarter of its financial year, surpassing analyst\nexpectations of some $60.88bn. Earnings per share increased 20% to $2.94,\nahead of the expected $2.83.\n\nShares in the group rose 4% during after-hours trading in New York on\nThursday.\n\nWith a stock market value of nearly $3tn, Microsoft is the world\u2019s largest\npublic company. Shares in the firm have increased by more than 30% over the\npast year \u2013 an impressive rise, although less than the rallies of Amazon and\nGoogle, whose stocks have risen by more than 60% and 40%, respectively.\n\nWith a multibillion-dollar investment in the ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\nMicrosoft has sought to position itself at the heart of AI\u2019s rise \u2013 and the\ndestination for the industry\u2019s top talent. In March, the company announced it\nhad hired a co-founder of Google\u2019s Deepmind AI subsidiary, Mustafa Suleyman,\nas well as a co-founder of $4bn startup Inflection AI and several of its\nemployees.\n\nIn November, after OpenAI\u2019s board ousted its co-founder and chief executive,\nSam Altman, he briefly said he would decamp to Seattle and join Microsoft in a\nmajor coup for Nadella. The majority of OpenAI\u2019s employees said they would\njoin Altman, which would effectively obliterate the company. Altman was\nreinstated as chief executive days later.\n\nMicrosoft is now trying to monetize its dominance in this space. The company\nreported in the final months of 2023 that AI contributed 6% of the revenue\ngrowth within its powerhouse Azure cloud computing division; up from 3% the\nprevious quarter, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Nadella highlighted LinkedIn\u2019s\nAI tools for writing posts and articles, which he said helped the number of\nLinkedIn sessions grow by 11%. Revenue from LinkedIn increased 10%, per\nMicrosoft\u2019s press release.\n\nIt has been signing a series of high-profile AI deals. Two days before this\nweek\u2019s earnings report, Microsoft announced that Coca-Cola had signed a five-\nyear, $1.1bn contract with Azure for AI and cloud computing services. Last\nmonth, it announced a partnership with AI startup Mistral to offer access to\nthe French company\u2019s models Azure.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
