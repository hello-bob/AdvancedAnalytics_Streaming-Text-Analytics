(Not this one! Everyone is very nice, and there is free Cherry\nCoke Zero with movie theater ice on the fifth floor.) If you\u2019re past 25,\nyou\u2019ve probably had one that left you feeling like a three-legged whippet\nabandoned at the pound. Maybe everything was grand, and then there was a\nregime change, and the new boss won\u2019t talk to you. Then you get demoted after\ngetting blamed for something that was really Dilbert No. 8\u2019s fault. Your sense\nof self-worth nosedives, and you must seek out a therapist who is not in your\nnetwork. You wander the streets looking up \u201cgaslighting\u201d on your phone and\nwondering if it is you who sucks.\n\nThis is pretty much the setup for Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cSlow Horses\u201d which begins its\ndelightfully grim third season on Wednesday. OK, there\u2019s a lot of intrigue and\ngunfire, but at its core it is the tale of precariously employed worker drones\nmaking their way through a broken workplace led by a flatulent boss with hair\nthat hasn\u2019t been washed since Guy Fawkes Day 2011. \u201cSlow Horses\u201d is a twist on\ntheir place of employment, Slough House, a diseased walk-up in London where\nthe discard pile of MI5, England\u2019s spy service, work shit jobs under the\nwatchful red eye of Jackson Lamb, a genius, rapidly calcifying spymaster who\ndoesn\u2019t play well with others, lives on kebabs, whiskey and a weekly brushing\nof the teeth. (His dream death is a heart attack on steep stairs after some\n\u201cdodgy vindaloo.\u201d) Lamb\u2019s charges are in Slough House because of addictions,\nroyal fuck-ups and misplayed office politics. (Except for computer genius\nChristopher Chung\u2019s Roddy Ho, who is there for simply being a computer genius\ndickhead.) MI5 keeps them around for off-the-books work too unseemly for \u201cThe\nPark,\u201d and as easily blamed sacrificial, uh, lambs when things go wrong.\n\n## Related Stories\n\nVIP+\n\n### \u2018Civil War\u2019 Record Opening Leaves A24 With More to Prove\n\n### Robert Downey Jr. Calls It \u2018Mind-Blowing\u2019 to Watch Jeremy Renner Celebrate\nat Chris Evans\u2019 Wedding After Snow Plow Accident: \u2018Yes, Miracles Happen\u2019\n\nGary Oldman plays Lamb as a cynic with a diseased heart of something that is\nnot quite gold. Oldman once portrayed John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s George Smiley, so\nimagine spymaster Smiley gone to seed, a seed buried at the bottom of a waste\ntreatment plant. He sharpened his yellow teeth in the last days of the Cold\nWar, and 30 years later he\u2019s been relegated to the third division of the spy\ngame at Slough House where he manages misfits while smoking, drinking and\nliving in his sad office. His nemesis is the perfectly coifed Diana Taverner,\nplayed by Kristin Scott-Thomas as an ice queen inexpertly climbing to the top\nof MI5\u2019s greasy pole. They\u2019re enemies, but enemies that need each other. An\nactor\u2019s master class occurs when the two occasionally meet to exchange\ninformation on a grubby bench on the Thames. Taverner taunts Lamb for his fall\nfrom grace, while Lamb responds with vulgar bon mots and a crop dusting of her\npersonal space. \u201cLady Di,\u201d as her subordinates call her, looks like merely\nbeing in Lamb\u2019s presence is draining her of her well-calculated chicness.\n\n### Popular on Variety\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nThe plough horses at Slough House are a delightfully diverse lot in both\nethnicity, gender and dysfunction. The lead mule is River Cartwright, played\nby the habitually great Jack Lowden, the scion of MI5 royalty who got played\nin a training exercise that resulted in the theoretical deaths of thousands,\nand avoided the pink slip only because his granddad (Jonathan Pryce) is MI5\nroyalty. His chief competitor for competence includes Louisa (Rosalind\nEleazar), who lost her partner last season, and is now seemingly on a bender\nof anonymous men and risky behavior that might end her days. This season,\nAimee-Ffion Edwards\u2019 Shirley Dander and Kadiff Kirwan\u2019s Marcus Longridge, coke\nuser and gambling addict respectively, play larger roles in the pursuit of, if\nnot justice, mitigating the amount of death and injustice being dropped on\nunsuspecting pawns. The actors are all perfectly slotted in their surliness,\nthanks to the magic of legendary casting director Nina Gold, who has now cast\n\u201cSlow Horses\u201d and \u201cBad Sisters,\u201d Apple TV+\u2019s two most accomplished shows.\n\nPart of the charm of \u201cSlow Horses\u201d is that Lamb and the Slough House inmates\nstill possess some kind of moral center. Lamb\u2019s moments of humanity are\nusually tied to coming to the aid of his spies, aka his \u201cJoes\u201d \u2014 some alive,\nmany dead. His conscience, as much as it exists, is his assistant Catherine\nStandish, played with mousy brilliance by Saskia Reeves. Lamb has a soft spot\nfor Catherine \u2014 well, because he murdered her previous boss, while Catherine\nthinks it was a suicide that she could have prevented if she had not been an\nalcoholic. Now, she spends her days at AA meetings and trying to prevent Lamb\nfrom blowing up what remains of his career.\n\nSeason 3 revolves around Standish\u2019s kidnapping after an AA meeting, and its\nties to a MI5 cover-up that involves keeping their dirty laundry private by\noffing their own agents. If there\u2019s a fault in the third season, it is that it\nseems the popularity of \u201cSlow Horses,\u201d particularly in the UK, has upped the\nproduction budget. This is most evident in the season\u2019s start with a\n\u201cBourne\u201d-like chase scene through Istanbul, and, later, a \u201cHeat\u201d-ish shootout\nthat goes on a bit too long. (I\u2019d much rather have 15 minutes more of Lamb\nslagging off his underlings in the unfashionable Barbican neighborhood of\nLondon.) But those are minor quibbles. The play \u2014 not so much the gunplay \u2014\nremains the thing.\n\n\u201cSlow Horses\u201d suggests that the workplace behind the camera is just as\nimportant. In addition to Gold\u2019s contributions, the series is centered on ace\nmaterial from the tart spy novels of Mick Herron, with scripts either written\nor overseen by Will Smith, a former producer on \u201cVeep.\u201d You can see that\nshow\u2019s influence in \u201cSlow Horses\u2019\u201d moments of black comedy, but this show has\na soul that \u201cVeep\u201d never had. We glimpse actual humanity in some of Lamb\u2019s\nmore benevolent antics; in River dealing with his beloved grandfather slipping\ninto dementia; and in Scott-Thomas\u2019 verbal wars with her boss, the equally\nsteel-willed Ingrid Tearney played by Sophie Okonedo. Oh yeah, Mick Jagger\nloved the books so much that he provided the acidic theme song.\n\nI\u2019d end this with a terrible line about how the horses of Slough House may be\nslow, but the show is a thoroughbred. That is if I hated my job, but I don\u2019t.\n(Did I mention the free Cherry Coke Zero?)\n\nJust watch.\n\nThe first two episodes of \u201cSlow Horses\u201d premiered on Apple TV+ on Nov. 29, and\nthe remaining four will be released weekly on Wednesdays\n\nJump to Comments\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?\n\nSubscribe Today\n\n## More From Variety\n\n### Ethan Hawke Lost the Oscar for \u2018Training Day\u2019 and Denzel Washington\nWhispered in His Ear That Losing Was Better: \u2018You Don\u2019t Want an Award to\nImprove Your Status\u2019\n\n### \u2018Civil War\u2019 Record Opening Leaves A24 With More to Prove\n\n### The Most-Anticipated Movies of 2024\n\n### Chris Hemsworth Takes Blame for \u2018Thor: Love and Thunder\u2019 Failure: \u2018I Got\nCaught Up in the Improv and the Wackiness\u2019 and \u2018Became a Parody of Myself\u2019\n\n### Survey: One-Third of Peacock Users Still Subscribe for Free\n\n### Robert Downey Jr. Calls It \u2018Mind-Blowing\u2019 to Watch Jeremy Renner Celebrate\nat Chris Evans\u2019 Wedding After Snow Plow Accident: \u2018Yes, Miracles Happen\u2019\n\nLoading comments...\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * ### Ethan Hawke Lost the Oscar for \u2018Training Day\u2019 and Denzel Washington Whispered in His Ear That Losing Was Better: \u2018You Don\u2019t Want an Award to Improve...\n\n  * ### Chris Hemsworth Takes Blame for \u2018Thor: Love and Thunder\u2019 Failure: \u2018I Got Caught Up in the Improv and the Wackiness\u2019 and \u2018Became a Parody of Myself...\n\n  * ### Robert Downey Jr. Calls It \u2018Mind-Blowing\u2019 to Watch Jeremy Renner Celebrate at Chris Evans\u2019 Wedding After Snow Plow Accident: \u2018Yes, Miracles Happen...\n\n  * ### James Gunn Confused by Conspiracy Theory Over Henry Cavill\u2019s Superman Re-Casting: My Superman \u2018Was Always Intended as and Pitched as a New Story...\n\n  * ### \u2018Avengers\u2019 Directors Say Marvel\u2019s Recent Problems Aren\u2019t Due to Superhero Fatigue but a \u2018Big Generational Divide About How You Consume Media...\n\n  * ### ABC News Meteorologist Rob Marciano Exits\n\n  * ### Jeff Bridges Returning for 'Tron: Ares'\n\n  * ### \u2018Unlocked: A Jail Experiment\u2019: Arkansas County Refuses $60,000 Check From Producers of Netflix Doc Amid Ongoing Legal Battle\n\n  * ### Jerry Seinfeld Says TV Comedy Is Being Killed By the \u2018Extreme Left and P.C.
