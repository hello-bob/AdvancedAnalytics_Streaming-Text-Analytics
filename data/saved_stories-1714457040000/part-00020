If you want to tell the best story you must include those\nelements in your writing and whenever possible, exercise brevity. I\u2019ve taken\non the task of introducing you to Nova Terra with those words in mind, having\nfocused on the who and the what thus far in blog posts #1 and #2 respectively.\nToday, I will answer our most asked question when it comes to EcoBlox: how do\nyou do make them?\n\nThis is how we do it:\n\nThe graphic above was not meant to give you intimate details about the process\nof making EcoBlox. It is a cool piece of content, in my opinion, that was\nprepared by students from the Colorado School of Mines in an effort to provide\na 20,000-foot view of Nova Terra\u2019s process. These engineering students are\npart of a Capstone project with Nova Terra where we are resource mapping and\nperforming soil tests on various quarry samples, and since they are such a\ndelight to work with I thought I should present their content.\n\nThis is how we do it:\n\nNova Terra is evolving the engineering behind EcoBlox every week, just as my\ncompany is evolving and I am evolving within the NREL West Gate program as an\nentrepreneur. I feel lucky to be surrounded by such thoughtful mentors, most\nof whom have been where I am right now. They have been in my shoes.\n\nA good percentage of them are women too, which makes their experience\nincredibly valid to me. They support my mission to scale and commercialize\nEcoBlox, and as a result, have helped to reduce my entrepreneurial fears to\nreasonable levels. They are serious about positioning Nova Terra for success\nand that level of support is priceless. It is wonderful and I am so grateful!\n\nLike most startup companies I want to generate some external funding in order\nto put my advanced business plan into motion, which affects how I scale Nova\nTerra in Colorado, across the United States, and possibly the world. That\nmeans I spend an ample amount of my time preparing for and delivering\npresentations in search of this funding. Tomorrow, in fact, I have the\nopportunity to pitch for a $250k grant, but we are only allowed five minutes\nto present. How much can you say in five short minutes? Have you ever tried to\nfind out by simply timing yourself? That\u2019s how I do it.\n\nIn next week\u2019s Substack post, I\u2019ll talk more about this pitch, where it took\nplace and where it fits within the lifecycle of Nova Terra. I appreciate your\nsubscriptions and engagements with the Nova Terra Substack thus far, and hope\nwe can have a public discussion about entrepreneurship, the value of\nmentorship and the power of EcoBlox right here on this post. I look forward to\nyour input.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLisa\n\nThanks for reading Nova Terra News!
