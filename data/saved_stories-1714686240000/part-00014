It\u2019s a rite of spring, like the migration of\nbirds. Their destination is the Combine, a weeklong event where National\nFootball League teams evaluate the talent to determine whom they\u2019ll select\nduring the upcoming NFL draft.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nSociety\n\n### Analytics wind up for a shot in ice hockey\n\nTechnology\n\n### Why some artificial intelligence is smart until it\u2019s dumb\n\nThe Mind\n\n### Lessons from sports psychology research\n\nIn a convention center ballroom not far from the stadium, another \u201ccombine\u201d is\ntaking place. Here the marquee event is not the 40-yard dash but the six-\nminute research presentation. The competitors are not sports stars but data\nscientists who\u2019ve come for the final round of the Big Data Bowl. Launched by\nthe NFL in 2018, this competition challenges teams of researchers to apply\nanalytics and AI tools to football data.\n\nOver the last several years, analytics have enabled NFL teams to evaluate\nplayers in ways not possible before \u2014 for example, assessing a defender\u2019s\nability to create tackling opportunities, not just completed tackles. Coaches\nuse the metrics to streamline game preparation. And fans, as well as bettors\nand bookmakers, crave the insights offered by what the NFL calls Next Gen\nStats.\n\nBig Data Bowl competitors, like their player counterparts, can be picked up by\na football team. About 40 have been hired by some 20 teams, says Mike Lopez,\nthe NFL\u2019s senior director of football data and analytics. Others have joined\ncompanies, including Zelus Analytics, StatsBomb and Telemetry Sports, that\nprovide data and services to NFL teams and other sports teams. (Stephanie\nKovalchik, a data scientist at Zelus Analytics, described how the same\ntechniques can be applied across different sports in 2023 in the Annual Review\nof Statistics and Its Application.)\n\nMore than 300 entries in 2024\u2019s Big Data Bowl were winnowed to five finalist\nteams invited to Indianapolis. \u201cYou have academics here, industry\nprofessionals, students, and collaborations between students and coaches,\u201d\nsays Ron Yurko, a statistician at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and\none of this year\u2019s finalists. The goal is to gain insight \u201cthat has football\nmeaning.\u201d\n\nData scientists Katherine Dai and Matt Chang explain their prizewinning\nresearch on missed tackle opportunities at the 2024 Big Data Bowl.\n\nCREDIT: AP IMAGES FOR THE NFL. USED WITH PERMISSION\n\n## Tracking every move\n\nBeginning in 2014, NFL players have worn a computer chip in their shoulder\npads. Ten times every second, the chip records player location, direction,\nvelocity and acceleration. \u201cNext Gen Stats in football means player tracking,\u201d\nLopez says. Since 2017, a similar chip has been in the ball, and all of the\ndata have been made available to all of the teams since 2018.\n\nBut that\u2019s only part of it. What really separates today\u2019s statistics is the\nway they are analyzed. The goal is to understand not just what happened, but\nalso why. Why did this run gain only three yards, while that one went for 88\nyards and a touchdown? In the process, Next Gen Stats for the first time can\nquantify the contributions of the unsung players who don\u2019t ever touch the\nball, such as the blocker who sprang the runner loose for that 88-yard\ntouchdown.\n\nKatherine Dai, one of this year\u2019s finalists, says the research presented in\nthe 2024 Big Data Bowl featured two complementary approaches. Analytics\ngenerally use human-derived formulas to extract meaningful metrics from the\ndata. In contrast, machine learning \u2014 the approach that has brought us\ngenerative AI like ChatGPT \u2014 trains the computer to figure out the most\npredictive features.\n\nIf a metric just captures what happened, it\u2019s probably analytics. If it relies\non a prediction or a probability of what could have happened, it\u2019s probably\nmachine learning, Dai says.\n\nThe winning entry in the 2024 Big Data Bowl assigns a missed tackle to a\ndefender when his probability of making a tackle rises above the 75 percent\nthreshold for at least half a second before dropping back and neither he nor a\nteammate makes the tackle in the next second. This example, from a November 7,\n2022, game between the Baltimore Ravens and the New Orleans Saints, shows the\npaths of five defenders (red squares on the left are missed tackles) and the\nrunner, Kenyan Drake (black square). Alontae Taylor, Kaden Elliss, Malcolm\nRoach and Zack Baun all had a chance to tackle the runner (right graph) before\nMarcus Maye succeeded.\n\nCREDIT: COURTESY OF KATHERINE DAI\n\nWhen the NFL hired Lopez, a former statistics professor at Skidmore College in\nNew York State and a former college football player, he sold them on the idea\nof the Big Data Bowl in his interview and promised that, as in the 1989 film\nField of Dreams, \u201cif you put the data out there, the analysts will come.\u201d But\nthree hours before the submissions deadline for the first competition, only\nthree had come in, and he was getting nervous. \u201cThen they started pouring in,\u201d\nhe says \u2014 100 between 9 p.m. and midnight. \u201cThat was a lesson to me on how\ndata scientists work.\u201d\n\nEvery year since, the competition has had a specific theme. In 2020, for\nexample, tracking data were used to predict the expected yards gained by a\nrunning play at any instant during the play, based on locations of the 22\nplayers and their speeds \u2014 a task made to order for machine learning.\n\nThe winners were a pair of data scientists based in Austria, Philipp Singer\nand Dmitry Gordeev, who had only rudimentary knowledge of American football.\nThey were both \u201cgrandmasters\u201d of computer competitions, and they developed a\nneural network, a common type of machine-learning algorithm, that blew the\nothers away.\n\nSinger and Gordeev\u2019s algorithm was adopted into several new Next Gen Stats:\nexpected rushing yards, rushing yards over expected (the difference between\nactual yards gained and the prediction), first down probability and touchdown\nprobability. The stats debuted on national TV just six months later.\n\nStay in the Know Sign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter today\n\n## Securing the win\n\nIf you were going to bet on the 2024 winner, a smart choice might have been\nYurko\u2019s team. He worked on football analytics even before the NFL got\ninterested. In 2017, Yurko and colleagues presented a technique for estimating\na football player\u2019s WAR, or wins above replacement, defined as the number of\nfractional wins created by a given player compared with an average replacement\nplayer. (It\u2019s \u201cfractional\u201d because only some portion of the credit for a win\nis granted to the player.)\n\nIn baseball, WAR has been a go-to metric for more than 20 years, but it wasn\u2019t\nso easy to generalize to football. Yurko\u2019s paper, reported in the Journal of\nQuantitative Analysis in Sports, inspired Nate Sterken, winner of the\ninaugural Big Data Bowl and now lead data scientist for the Cleveland Browns,\nto go into football analytics.\n\nYurko was a Big Data Bowl judge, but stopped judging when he joined the\nCarnegie Mellon faculty because, he says, \u201cI wanted my students to win.\u201d\nIndeed, his students were on two of this year\u2019s five final teams, and one\nstudent, Quang Nguyen, was a finalist for the second year in a row.\n\nThe theme for 2024 was tackling, and Yurko\u2019s team used tracking data to\ncalculate a physics-based measure for fractional tackles. After identifying\nwhen the runner\u2019s forward momentum decreases significantly, the computer\nidentifies the nearby defenders and divides credit accordingly. If two\ndefenders are nearby when the runner\u2019s momentum decreases by 50 percent, for\nexample, they each get credit for 25 percent of the ultimate tackle.\n\nThe fractional tackle metric highlights the contributions of defensive\nlinemen, who often slow the runner down but less often complete the tackle.\nThese linemen (or their agents) can use this stat when negotiating salaries,\nfor instance.\n\nBut Yurko\u2019s team didn\u2019t win. Instead, victory \u2014 and a prize of $25,000 \u2014 went\nto Dai, Matthew Chang, Daniel Jiang and Harvey Cheng. Three of the data\nscientists had met as graduate students at Princeton. None had entered a\ncoding competition before. \u201cWe joked that it would be a good excuse to watch\nsome football,\u201d Dai says. None had worked in sports analytics, but \u201cwe\u2019re open\nto it,\u201d she adds.\n\nWith 13:05 left to play in the November 7, 2022, game between the Baltimore\nRavens and the New Orleans Saints (right), the ball carrier Kenyan Drake\n(number 17 in white) has broken free from four tackling opportunities (red\nboxes, left). A human scorer charged only Malcolm Roach (number 97) with a\nmissed tackle, but advanced data analytics concluded that three additional\nplayers should also have been charged with missed tackles (27, 55 and 53,\ndiving). Another player, Marcus Maye (6), caught up with Drake at around the\n50-yard line to finally make the tackle.\n\nCREDITS: LEFT, COURTESY OF KATHERINE DAI. RIGHT, NFL. USED WITH PERMISSION\n\nThe team first tried to predict at any moment the probability of a tackle\nwithin the next second, but three algorithms that used neural networks weren\u2019t\naccurate enough. So the team pivoted to decision trees, another well-known\nmachine learning method, and hit pay dirt. Predictions of tackles improved,\nplus the team could identify near misses.\n\nAfter charting the probabilities of multiple defenders getting a tackle on the\nsame play across time, Chang noticed peaks and valleys. Comparing that with\nvideo of the plays revealed that the peaks matched up with someone missing a\ntackle. \u201cAll credit to Matt,\u201d Dai says.\n\nThat led the team to a quantifiable definition for a missed tackle: It occurs\nwhen a defensive player\u2019s probability of making a tackle exceeds 75 percent\nfor more than half a second, then drops below 75 percent, and neither he nor\nhis teammates make a tackle within the next second. It\u2019s a simple definition,\nbut the trick is computing the probability, which depends on machine learning.\n\nAll of these metrics still have room to evolve. Matt Edwards, head of American\nfootball analysis at StatsBomb, notes that both teams evaluated tackling based\non proximity to the runner, not actual contact. That\u2019s a limitation of the\ntracking data; the chips can\u2019t tell whether the players are touching. The old-\nfashioned approach of having humans watch game video can do that.\n\nAnd though chip-based data aren\u2019t available for college players, some teams\nwill take tracking data from video alongside new analytics into consideration\nin the next NFL draft, which begins April 25.\n\nEdwards points to the Los Angeles Rams. Instead of relying on how a player\nperforms in the 40-yard dash and other Combine events that don\u2019t replicate\nwhat happens in an actual game, the Rams are looking solely at tracking data.\n\u201cYou want to know how quickly he gets off the ball,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cWhat is\nhis closing speed and reaction time when the ball is in the air? These are\nfootball-specific skills.\u201d\n\n10.1146/knowable-042324-2\n\nDana Mackenzie is a mathematician who went rogue and became a science writer.\nHe likes learning about unexpected ways in which math pops up in everyday\nlife.\n\nRepublish This Article\n\n  * Artificial Intelligence\n  * Computer Science\n  * Society\n  * Technology\n\nStay in the Know Sign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter today\n\nShare this article\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Pocket\n  * Reddit\n  * Flipboard\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * Republish\n\n## Support Knowable Magazine\n\nHelp us make scientific knowledge accessible to all\n\nDonate\n\nTAKE A DEEPER DIVE | Explore Related Scholarly Articles\n\nANNUAL REVIEW OF STATISTICS AND ITS APPLICATION\n\n### Player Tracking Data in Sports\n\nSports analytics now use the latest computer learning methods to extract\nmeaningful insights from player tracking data, which give the precise location\nand speed of the ball and players on the court, pitch, rink or gridiron.\n\nANNUAL REVIEW OF STATISTICS AND ITS APPLICATION\n\n### Modeling Player and Team Performance in Basketball\n\nData analysts have used increasingly high-resolution data in basketball to\nevaluate and detect team strategies, measure the performance of players, and\ngenerate predictive insights such as the expected value of a possession at any\nmoment in time.\n\nMore From\n\n### A new way of looking at concussions\n\n### Is it time to bring data to managing?\n\nKnowable Magazine is from Annual Reviews, a nonprofit publisher dedicated to\nsynthesizing and integrating knowledge for the progress of science and the\nbenefit of society.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Annual Reviews\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * YouTube\n  * Reddit\n  * Flipboard\n  * RSS Feed\n\n  * Donate\n  * About\n  * Staff\n  * Contact\n  * Newsletter\n  * Republish\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n\nClose X\n\n## Knowable Magazine is available for free.
