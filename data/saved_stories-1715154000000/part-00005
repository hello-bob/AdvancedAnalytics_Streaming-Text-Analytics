The Opal C1 is a beautifully designed (temporarily\ndisabled) 4k webcam that was better than what others had to offer. Opal also\nsells another cute and well-designed webcam called Tadpole, primarily for\nWindows Laptop users.\n\nEvery startup thinks their baby is the most beautiful. Still, I am not the one\nto not try something new. What sold me was their persuasive argument. Not only\nwill the image quality be great, they will continue to improve the hardware\nwith new software upgrades.\n\nChugh and Sohlstrom said that with computer vision (and other aspects of AI)\nmaking progress by the week, we can\u2019t think of the camera as static hardware.\nIt can not just be upgraded, but also, the hardware can be given more\ncapabilities over a period of time.\n\nThe ability to upgrade hardware via firmware is well understood, but very few\ncamera (and device makers) think of continuously enhancing their products with\nsoftware. In other words, the camera is no different from a computer for them.\nJust like smartphone companies \u2014 who use their smart phone\u2019s innards to make\nthe camera better.\n\nOpal has since released a product called Composer, which allows you to enhance\nyour Opal Camera. It takes advantage of onboard chips to do so. By installing\nthe software, you can increase (or decrease) the depth of field effect (Bokeh)\nby controlling the virtual aperture. If you own an iPhone, this is the webcam\nequivalent of Portrait mode. In a media release, Opal explained:\n\n> The neural nets we are running become steps in a longer pipeline used within\n> features on the device. For example Bokeh \u2013 for our Bokeh effect, we start\n> with a neural network guessing the segmentation between the foreground and\n> background, which kicks off a proprietary set of filters that tune the\n> segment, and a graphic rendering pipeline that actually models the physics\n> of how light enters a lens through a hexagonal lens \u2013 all to make a Bokeh\n> effect that is far more convincing than anything else out there. Each of\n> these steps, we\u2019re doing 30 times a second.\n\nYou can Zoom in on your face and have the camera follow you around. There are\nseveral other enhancements, for example, pinch to zoom. The multiple mics\nfilter out the noise. And you can create a \u201clook\u201d for yourself. Opal is not\nthe only game in town \u2014 China-based Insta360 makes Link, a 4K webcam, that too\nis \u201cAI\u201d enhanced and offers gesture control, AI tracking, and many such\nfeatures. These are table stakes in the business now. No wonder I find\nLogitech dowdy, in comparison.\n\nIn the past, you needed mirrorless cameras to get similar functionality, and\neven then they are not very advanced. In comparison, Composer is a collection\nof algorithms and software that has the option of giving a $200 webcam more\ncapabilities by the day. Hardware companies such as Opal have to consider\noffering a paid service where software and algorithms, and not hardware, help\nthem make a profit by enhancing the camera on an ongoing basis. That is better\nthan a one-time \u201chardware\u201d sale.\n\nAn ongoing evolution happening in the world of cameras. While overall sales of\ncameras might be slumping, there are many more \u201ccameras\u201d out in the world. In\n2016, I made my argument in The New Yorker:\n\n> We are splintering what was the \u201ccamera\u201d and its functionality\u2014lens,\n> sensors, and processing\u2014into distinct parts, but, instead of lenses and\n> shutters, software and algorithms are becoming the driving force. And this\n> is not just happening on smartphone cameras. You can expect the software to\n> define and enhance what lenses, sensors, and processing units in other\n> settings can do. Dash cams, security cams, adventure cams, driving\n> cams\u2014these are just early examples of devices that have specific\n> applications, cameras that could become much more powerful in the future.\n\nEvery single time I use Opal\u2019s Composer, I become acutely aware of how far\nbehind the camera companies are lagging in thinking about artificial\nintelligence, computer vision, and software to look beyond selling hardware.\nIt is even more confounding because most modern mirrorless cameras have\nprocessors, connectivity, storage, and power. The possibilities are endless.\n\nSadly, Sony and Nikons of the world make hardware \u2014 and they won\u2019t even know\nhow to contemplate the notion \u2014 that sometimes, a camera is not just a camera.\n\nApril 22, 2024.

High end mirrorless cameras can\nbe beautiful things (Yes, I\u2019m also a Leica fan), but they are ripe for\nreinvention.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n    1. Om Malik says:\n\nApril 22, 2024 at 5:21 pm\n\nI was hoping that Leica could take the next step with the SL3 but it hasn\u2019t,\nbut then neither have others. So the status quo continues.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  2. Scott Wharton says:\n\nApril 22, 2024 at 8:29 pm\n\nHave you seen the new Logitech Brio MX 705? It has similar functionality and\nthe software in their Tune app. And at $199, it\u2019s both better and cheaper. But\nthe marketing is not as crisp I\u2019ll admit. Mea culpa: I used to run this group\nso I\u2019m biased but I think you should take a close look.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n    1.

I am growing tired of my\ncurrent webcam, and as a camera nerd, am eager to hear which offers the better\nresults between the Opal and the new Logitech Brio MX! I tried the \u201cSLR as a\nwebcam\u201d thing but it\u2019s heavy and I didn\u2019t to have to keep resetting it\u2019s\nposition, especially now that webcam software is getting so good\u2014as you say.\nWill follow with interest.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n        1. Om Malik says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 11:06 am\n\nI am told the Logitech is very good. I don\u2019t have it. I will order it and will\nshare my opinion. For now, I have Opal C1 and it is doing a great job.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n        2. Scott Wharton says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 11:53 am\n\nWe built the MX Brio 705 to be an SLR replacement with very high quality but\nall of the good things about Logitech. Smaller, low prices, easy to use,\nsoftware integration. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing what Om thinks. There are\nmany reviews of the product online now.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
