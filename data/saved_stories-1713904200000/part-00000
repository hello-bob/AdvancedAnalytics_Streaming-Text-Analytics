For those not yet\ntaking the leap to this big NetBSD update, NetBSD 9.4 is out today for those\nrelying on the stable NetBSD 9 series.\n\nNetBSD 9.4 brings various stability enhancements and security fixes. With\nNetBSD 9.3 having debuted back in 2022, there's a lot in NetBSD 9.4 in terms\nof fixes.\n\nNetBSD 9.4 also includes some updated hardware support such as Intel 600 and\n700 series chipset support in various drivers, AMD Zen 3 and Zen 4 support\nwithin the temperature driver and related components, supporting newer CPUs in\ntprof, and various support additions for different wired/wireless network\nadapters and other device ASICs. NetBSD 9.4 also ships with an updated X.Org\nServer due to all the security vulnerabilities found over the past two years,\nupdated OpenSSL, and other package updates.\n\nThe release announcement strongly recommends that NetBSD 9 users upgrade to\nNetBSD 9.4 if not going straight away for NetBSD 10.\n\n2 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nOpenBSD 7.5 Released - Faster Performance For Many-Core ARM Servers\n\nNetBSD 10.0 Released With Much Improved Hardware Support & Faster Performance\n\nFreeBSD 13.3 Released With Better WiFi Support, LLVM objdump Added\n\nNetBSD 10.0 Should Be Released Soon - Likely Last RC Debuts\n\nFreeBSD 13.3-RC1 Improves WiFi Stability, Takes Care Of Some Kernel Panics\n\nFreeBSD Has Been Working On AMD64 SIMD libc Optimizations - Coming For FreeBSD\n14.1\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
