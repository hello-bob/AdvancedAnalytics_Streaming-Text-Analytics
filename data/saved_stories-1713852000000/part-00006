The first four installments examined a broad range of\ntopics, from ancient Egypt, to the Roman Empire, to the Napoleonic era, to the\nUS Civil War, and up through events in the 1990s. Of all the entries I\ncontributed, the one I had the most fun researching and writing was about\nMarco Polo and the origin of pasta. In this edition, I\u2019m going solo with a\nfull menu of myths about culinary and food-related history. Dig in and enjoy.\n\n###\n\nMyth: George Washington Carver invented peanut butter\n\nGeorge Washington Carver was a man of incredible accomplishment. Born into\nslavery in antebellum Missouri, Carver, fascinated with plants from a young\nage, went on to become an agricultural chemist, agronomist, and famous food\ninnovator. He spent decades teaching about agriculture, often going out of his\nway to ensure that his courses and lessons could reach those most in need.\nCarver created the Jesup Wagon, a classroom on wheels that traveled the\nAmerican countryside educating farmers about different crops and better\nagricultural techniques. As a pioneering advocate of emerging practices like\nsoil conservation and crop rotation, his efforts helped save many Southern\nfarmers from ruin in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.\n\nCarver figured out how to turn soybeans into paints and stains, invented 118\nproducts (both foods and non-foods) from sweet potatoes, and developed another\n300 from peanuts alone. According to the US Department of Agriculture, \u201cAmong\nCarver\u2019s many synthetic discoveries: adhesives, axle grease, bleach, chili\nsauce, creosote, dyes, flour, instant coffee, shoe polish, shaving cream,\nvanishing cream, wood stains and fillers, insulating board, linoleum, meat\ntenderizer, metal polish, milk flakes, soil conditioner, and Worcestershire\nsauce.\u201d His bottomless bag of tricks and discoveries for how to eat and use\npeanuts earned him the nickname the \u201cPeanut Man.\u201d As peanut butter rose in\npopularity in the 20th century, the Peanut Man and peanut butter became\ninextricably linked, but of George Washington Carver\u2019s myriad contributions to\nfood, inventing peanut butter wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nPeanuts are native to South America, with peanut fossils dating back at least\n8,500 years. The earliest known version of peanut butter was found among the\nIncas between 1200 and 1533 CE,1 where peanuts were roasted and ground into a\nsort of paste. In 1884, the Canadian chemist Marcellus Gilmore Edson was\nissued a US patent to create a peanut paste of his own, processed with heat to\ncreate a product he called \u201cpeanut candy\u201d \u2014 still not quite the same as the\npeanut butter we eat today, but more recognizable than what the Incas made. It\nwas John Harvey Kellogg \u2014 the cereal guy, and a Seventh-Day Adventist\nvegetarian \u2014 who developed modern peanut butter in 1895 to be a healthy\nalternative to eating meat.\n\nGeorge Washington Carver was an amazingly prolific, ingenious, generous,\nbarrier-shattering innovator who deserves to be celebrated for what he did \u2014\nnot what he didn\u2019t.\n\nGeorge Washington Carver circa 1940\n\n###\n\nMyth: Croissants were invented in France, or in celebration of the Ottoman\nEmpire\u2019s defeat in the Battle of Vienna\n\nNo country has been more influential on global culinary arts than France. Half\nthe techniques, recipes, cookware, and terminology people use around the world\nstem from or have been influenced by French creations, French improvements,\nand, yes, French colonialism (e.g. modern Vietnamese cuisine). Imperialism\nsucks, but ph\u1edf slaps. But one of France\u2019s most iconic foods, the croissant, is\nlayered with more myths than butter.\n\nFor starters, the croissant ain\u2019t French in origin. According to the Institute\nof Culinary Education, croissants originated in Austria as a half-moon-shaped\nroll made with copious amounts of butter or lard called a kipferl or kipfel.\nRecords indicate that kipferls go back to at least the 13th century. As\nSmithsonian Magazine\u2019s Amanda Fiegl writes, \u201cAs recently as the 19th century,\nthe French viewed the croissant as a foreign novelty, sold only in special\nViennese bakeries in the pricier parts of Paris.\u201d The croissant was inspired\nby the kipferl and perfected by the French, who upped the flakiness with a\nlaminated yeast dough and even more butter \u2014 just don\u2019t say this in front of\nany Austrians.\n\nAnother legend has it that Marie Antoinette, who was born in Austria,\nintroduced the kipferl to the French court because she missed the food of her\nhomeland, but there\u2019s no evidence for this. The evidence we do have shows that\nAustrian businessman August Zang popularized kipferls in Paris in 1839, and\nthe first French version of the croissant was officially recorded in 1915 by\nSylvain Claudius Goy. Over the course of the 20th century, croissants became\nfixtures in everyday French eating, and gained worldwide recognition.\n\nOne more myth surrounding the origin of the kipferl/croissant claims that the\npastry was invented in celebration of the defeat of the Ottomans in the Battle\nof Vienna in 1683, with its crescent shape designed to resemble the moon on\nthe Ottoman flag. Since we know the roll is centuries older than this battle,\nwe can safely say that this, too, is a myth.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve never seen what all the fuss is about when it comes to\ncroissants, but the number of myths surrounding a food\u2019s history is usually a\npretty good indicator that it\u2019s reached the highest echelons of popularity.\n\n###\n\nMyth: MSG is harmful for health\n\nOne of those zombie lies that just won\u2019t die despite being riddled with fact-\nchecking bullets is that monosodium glutamate, the flavor-enhancing food\nadditive commonly abbreviated as MSG, is particularly harmful and even\ndangerous to human health.2 On its face, this seems a purely health-related\nmatter, however there is an important historical element to it. First, let\u2019s\naddress the health claims.\n\nOne systematic review of the medical literature after the next has shown that\nthere\u2019s no real problem with MSG. A 2017 review in the World Journal of\nPharmaceutical Sciences noted that \u201cMSG is one of the most intensely studied\nfood ingredients in the food supply and has been found safe.\u201d Another 2019\nsystematic review in Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety\nconcluded, \u201cCritical analysis of existing literature establishes that many of\nthe reported negative health effects of MSG have little relevance for chronic\nhuman exposure and are poorly informative.\u201d\n\nThe only real health risk of MSG is the sodium content (monosodium glutamate).\nWhile MSG contains only about a third of the sodium found in salt, making it a\ncomparatively healthier flavor-enhancer, it still has a fair amount of sodium,\nsomething almost all people in developed countries eat too much of. If you\nwould think it insane to boycott a Chinese restaurant because its menu doesn\u2019t\nadvertise \u201cno salt\u201d, you shouldn\u2019t be doing so because it doesn\u2019t say \u201cno\nMSG.\u201d But where did MSG\u2019s undeservedly bad rap come from?\n\nMSG was first discovered by the Japanese Chemist Kikunae Ikeda in 1908 when he\nextracted it from kombu, an edible seaweed. By the 1950s, it had become a\ncommonly used ingredient in processed foods the world over. But in the 60s,\nconsumers began to scrutinize food additives, and a single complaint caught\nfire. As the food and health reporter Anna Maria Barry-Jester put it in\nFiveThirtyEight:\n\n> \u201cIn 1968, the New England Journal of Medicine published a letter from a\n> doctor complaining about radiating pain in his arms, weakness, and heart\n> palpitations after eating at Chinese restaurants. He mused that cooking\n> wine, MSG, or excessive salt might be to blame. Reader responses poured in\n> with similar complaints, and scientists jumped to research the phenomenon.\n> \u2018Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\u2019 was born.\u201d3\n\nOf course, this letter was speculative, entirely anecdotal, and not a\nscientific study of any kind. But once it began to spread like wildfire, the\nfact that it was penned by a doctor and published in the prestigious New\nEngland Journal of Medicine lent it an air of authority, even though it was\nsimply a glorified reader response letter. A series of flawed and later\ndebunked studies came out in the years following which muddied the issue\nfurther. All of this occurred after 1965, when the US dramatically opened up\nimmigration from Asian countries, among others. The wish to connect this\nsupposedly toxic ingredient with Asian immigrants played an undeniable role in\nthe degree to which MSG became stigmatized.\n\nThe sad irony is that those who most fear MSG to this day tend to be\npolitically progressive \u201cnatural\u201d food advocates \u2014 the kinds of people who\nstill mask in public and punctuate commands to \u201cBelieve. The. Science\u201d with\nclap emojis. But their animus is unscientific and rooted in xenophobia.\n\n###\n\nMyth: Tang was invented by NASA, for NASA, or as a result of space race\ntechnologies\n\nNASA and the space race produced a number of spin-off technologies with\napplications that help plenty of people down here on Earth, such as memory\nfoam, the computer mouse, artificial limbs, freeze drying, scratch-resistant\nlenses, wireless headphones, and more. But, contrary to popular belief, Tang,\nthe powdered orange-flavored drink mix, wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nIn his book, Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us (2013), Michael\nMoss tells the tale of Tang. In 1956, Al Clausi, a food scientist at General\nFoods,4 figured out how to create a synthetic orange juice-like powder\nfortified with a comparable amount of vitamin C to the real thing. Two years\nlater, Tang hit the shelves. When prepared as directed, Tang had only a bit\nmore sugar than real juice, but since the product was a powder, consumers\ncould \u2014 and usually did \u2014 add somewhat more per glass than the suggested\nserving size. It became a high-sugar soft drink that folks rationalized as\nhealthy because it contained vitamin C. Then, as Moss writes:\n\n> \u201cNASA, the space program, needed a drink that would add little bulk to the\n> digestion, given the toilet constraints in space. Real orange juice had too\n> much bulky fiber in its pulp. Tang, however, was perfect \u2014 what\n> technologists call a \u2018low-residue\u2019 food. When NASA heard about Tang, Clausi\n> instructed a colleague: \u2018Tell NASA we\u2019re honored to be of service, and we\u2019ll\n> supply whatever they need \u2014 free of charge.\u2019 On February 20, 1962, John\n> Glenn returned from his triple orbit around the earth and told reporters\n> that the only good thing about the food aboard his spacecraft was the Tang.\n> With that endorsement, sales exploded.\u201d\n\nTang gained a reputation as a futuristic \u201castronaut food\u201d, and from there, it\nwas only a matter of time before it joined the ranks of velcro and teflon as\napocryphal innovations or spin-offs from space technology. In reality, it was\n(and still is) little more than orange Kool-Aid that got some awesome PR from\nan astronaut who used it to wash down freeze-dried space food. NASA should be\nembarrassed at the free press they gave to Tang, but at least they can take\nsolace in the fact they didn\u2019t invent the stuff.\n\n1960s advertisement for Tang\n\n###\n\nMyth: Sushi originated in Japan\n\nAs its popularity exploded across the world over the past few decades, sushi\nhas become perhaps Japan\u2019s most globally recognized and celebrated dish. But\nthe history of sushi is a long and murky path that takes us beyond the shores\nof Japan.\n\nThe earliest proto-sushi, called \u201cnarezushi\u201d (\u201cmatured sushi\u201d), originated in\nChina sometime between the 5th and 3rd centuries BCE. It involved pickling and\nfermenting fish with rice, vinegar, wine, and salt as a way of preserving it.\nThis practice made the trip across the pond to Japan sometime between 710 and\n794 CE. Over the centuries, changes and innovations in cooking and preparation\ntechniques sped up the fermentation process. During the Edo period\n(1603\u20131868), people began using vinegar separately to directly flavor the\nfish, allowing it to be eaten right away while retaining that sour fermented\ntaste. They called it \u201chayazushi\u201d (\u201cquick sushi\u201d). By 1820, the art of sushi\nmaking had evolved to its modern form, \u201cnigirizushi\u201d (hand-rolled sushi) made\nby a chef named Yohei Hanaya.\n\nWhat began as a method for food preservation progressed through the years from\na product that was slowly fermented and pickled to a freshly prepared dish\nthat retained a similar flavor profile through the use of seasoned vinegar and\ncondiments. To set what we now think of as sushi side by side with the very\nearliest Chinese narezushi, they seem like two entirely separate species of\nfood with nothing in common. And yet they share a gastronomical lineage\nreflected in their names. So no, Japan did not invent the original sushi, but\nthey made it infinitely better, faster, and more popular \u2014 and at the end of\nthe day, that\u2019s actually the far more impressive accomplishment.

Spiciness is not actually a flavor detected by taste buds, but\nrather a mouth sensation.) Savoriness comes primarily from glutamic acid\n(monosodium glutamate), the most abundant amino acid found naturally occurring\nin food and within the human body.\n\nCultures around the world have been using glutamate-rich foods to enhance the\nflavors of dishes for ages. Italians use anchovies and aged Parmigiano\nReggiano cheese. Throughout Asia, people use mushrooms, fish sauce, and\nfermented pastes such as miso, doubanjiang, and gochujang. And pretty much\neveryone at this point cooks with soy sauce, tomato paste, and garlic. Food\nmanufacturers skirt the notice of misinformed but health-conscious consumers\nwith \u201cno MSG\u201d ingredients like yeast extract and mushroom extract that perform\nthe same savory-boosting function because they share the same active\ningredient \u2014 glutamic acid. MSG is simply the chemically pure essence of all\nof these ingredients \u2014 it\u2019s the Walter White \u201cblue sky\u201d of umami, or what\ncomedian Nigel Ng\u2019s character Uncle Roger calls the \u201cking of flavor\u201d and \u201csalt\non crack.\u201d\n\n3\n\nThe aforementioned 2017 systematic review: \u201cA popular belief is that large\ndoses of MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort, known as\n\u2018Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\u2019 (CRS), but double-blind tests fail to find\nevidence of such a reaction.\u201d\n\nAnd the 2019 systematic review: \u201cReports on MSG hypersensitivity, also known\nas \u2018Chinese restaurant syndrome\u2019, or links of its use to increased pain\nsensitivity and atopic dermatitis were found to have little supporting\nevidence.\u201d\n\n4\n\nGeneral Foods was acquired by Philip Morris (the tobacco company) in 1985 and\nmerged with Kraft in 1990.\n\n### Subscribe to American Dreaming\n\nBy Jamie Paul \u00b7 Launched 3 years ago\n\nPolitics, culture, and commentary from an outside the box, non-ideological\nperspective.\n\n3 Likes\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Everything You Know About History Is Wrong: Part V \u2014 Food Edition\n\namericandreaming.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nIntent Doesn\u2019t Matter?\n\nLet\u2019s Think This Through Here\n\nFeb 19, 2021 \u2022\n\nJamie Paul\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Intent Doesn\u2019t Matter?\n\namericandreaming.substack.com\n\n3\n\nCollege Was the Biggest Mistake of My Life\n\nWe desperately need a change in culture.\n\nApr 23, 2022 \u2022\n\nJamie Paul\n\n7\n\nShare this post\n\n#### College Was the Biggest Mistake of My Life\n\namericandreaming.substack.com\n\n5\n\nAndrew Yang\u2019s New \"Forward\" Party Isn't What You Think\n\nOn third parties in general, the Forward Party in particular, and why the\noutrage is overblown.\n\nOct 14, 2021 \u2022\n\nJamie Paul\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Andrew Yang\u2019s New \"Forward\" Party Isn't What You Think\n\namericandreaming.substack.com\n\n6\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 American Dreaming\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
