This is compared to an\nincrease of 1.8% in the final three months of 2023.\n\nRaising interest rates makes borrowing - for things such as loans and\nmortgages - more expensive and theoretically is meant to encourage people to\nspend less. The idea is that this helps to bring inflation down by dampening\ndemand.\n\nHowever, US inflation has not fallen back as quickly as expected.\n\nAt the same time, economic growth - measured as gross domestic product (GDP) -\nhas slowed from 3.4% growth in the final three months of last year to 1.6%.\nEconomists had been expected it to decelerate but only to 2.4%.\n\nOlu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch, the credit rating agency,\nsaid: \"The hot inflation print is the real story in this report.\n\n\"If growth continues to slowly decelerate, but inflation strongly takes off\nagain in the wrong direction, the expectation of a Fed interest rate cut in\n2024 is starting to look increasingly more out of reach.\"\n\nThe key US interest rate is between 5.25% to 5.5% - the highest level in more\nthan 20 years.\n\nStuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital in London, said the US\nFederal Reserve, which sets interest rates, was \"now finding itself caught\nbetween a rock and a hard place\".\n\n\"The growth numbers suggest monetary policy has worked its magic and the Fed's\nfoot on the monetary brake can be eased somewhat,\" he said.\n\n\"But the inflation figures suggest otherwise, and potentially even point to\nthe need for a further tightening.\"\n\nThe 1.6% growth figure is the first estimate of GDP. A second reading, \"based\non more complete source data\", will be released on 30 May.\n\nNevertheless, the economy is a key issue as the US heads towards an election\nlater this year.\n\n## US inflation jumps as fuel and housing costs rise\n\n## US bank boss warns interest rates could rise to 8%\n\nUS economy\n\nInflation\n\nGDP\n\nEconomic growth\n\nRelated\n\n## How Chinese firms are using Mexico as a backdoor to the US\n\n4 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## Workers take on car giant Volkswagen in fight for pay\n\n16 Apr 2024\n\nBusiness\n\n## Russia to grow faster than all advanced economies\n\n16 Apr 2024\n\nBusiness\n\nMore\n\n2 days ago\n\n## 'We need a miracle' - Israeli and Palestinian economies battered by war\n\nSix months of conflict have also taken a heavy economic toll.\n\n2 days ago\n\nMiddle East\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Petrol prices on UK forecourts hit 150p a litre\n\nRising oil prices have lifted the cost of filling up but it may prove short-\nterm, claim experts.\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n3 days ago\n\n## How does government borrowing work?\n\nHow does government borrowing work, and how and when is the money paid back?\n\n3 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n4 days ago\n\n## Is Rishi Sunak keeping his five key promises?\n\nThe prime minister said five priorities should be used to hold his government\nto account.\n\n4 days ago\n\nReality Check\n\n8 days ago\n\n## Rising costs push fish supper price 'to ceiling'\n\nA local fish and chip shop owner says he has witnessed multiple businesses\nclose in recent months due to rising costs.\n\n8 days ago\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
