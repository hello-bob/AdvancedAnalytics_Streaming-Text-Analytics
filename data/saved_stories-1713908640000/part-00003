That\u2019s one of the lessons\nfrom Amazon\u2019s recent decision to dial back its much-ballyhooed \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d\nshopping technology, a seemingly science-fiction-esque software that actually\nfunctioned, in no small part, thanks to behind-the-scenes human labor.\n\nThis phenomenon is nicknamed \u201cfauxtomation\u201d because it \u201chides the human work\nand also falsely inflates the value of the \u2018automated\u2019 solution,\u201d says Irina\nRaicu, director of the Internet Ethics program at Santa Clara University\u2019s\nMarkkula Center for Applied Ethics.\n\nTake Just Walk Out: It promises a seamless retail experience in which\ncustomers at Amazon Fresh groceries or third-party stores can grab items from\nthe shelf, get billed automatically and leave without ever needing to check\nout. But Amazon at one point had more than 1,000 workers in India who trained\nthe Just Walk Out AI model\u2014and manually reviewed some of its sales\u2014according\nto an article published last year on the Information, a technology business\nwebsite.\n\nAn anonymous source who\u2019d worked on the Just Walk Out technology told the\noutlet that as many as 700 human reviews were needed for every 1,000 customer\ntransactions. Amazon has disputed the Information\u2019s characterization of its\nprocess. A company representative told Scientific American that while Amazon\n\u201ccan\u2019t disclose numbers,\u201d Just Walk Out has \u201cfar fewer\u201d workers annotating\nshopping data than has been reported. In an April 17 blog post, Dilip Kumar,\nvice president of Amazon Web Services applications, wrote that \u201cthis is no\ndifferent than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where\nhuman reviewers are common.\u201d\n\nNews of this technology\u2019s retirement in U.S. Amazon Fresh stores\u2014in favor of\nshopping carts that let customers scan items as they shop\u2014has triggered\nrenewed focus on an uncomfortable truth about Silicon Valley hype.\nTechnologies heralded as automating away dull or dangerous work may still need\nhumans in the loop, or as one Bloomberg columnist put it, AI software \u201coften\nrequires armies of human babysitters.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hardly a new phenomenon. Throughout history, canny inventors and\nentrepreneurs have sought to slap the \u201cautomated\u201d label on what was really\njust normal human activity. Take the \u201cMechanical Turk,\u201d a robe-clad robot that\ninventor Wolfgang von Kempelen debuted in the early 1770s. Von Kempelen would\ntell observers that the humanoid machine could play full games of chess,\nopening up the automaton to show off clockwork mechanisms within, as Atlas\nObscura recounted.\n\nBut the Mechanical Turk was a sham. As many contemporary observers began to\nsuspect, a human operator was hiding in a chamber beneath the chessboard and\ncontrolling its movements by candlelight. The clockwork mechanisms were simply\nwindow dressing for an easily impressed audience.\n\nUeber den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung by\nJoseph Racknitz, 1789.\n\nEraza Collection/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps fitting that Amazon now runs a platform with the same name that\nlets companies crowdsource piecemeal online tasks that require human judgment,\nsuch as labeling the training data that modern AI systems learn from. After\nall, charades in the style of the original Mechanical Turk\u2014nominally automated\nsystems that actually rely on human help, or what Jeff Bezos once dubbed\n\u201cartificial artificial intelligence\u201d\u2014are common features of the modern Web,\nwhere an aura of technological sophistication can sometimes be more important\nthan technological sophistication itself.\n\n## Curated by Our Editors\n\n  * ### Spiderlike Mars Robot Might One Day Crawl through Unexplored Volcanic Caves\n\nLauren Leffer\n\n  * ### Humans Absorb Bias from AI--And Keep It after They Stop Using the Algorithm\n\nLauren Leffer\n\n  * ### Algorithms Are Making Important Decisions.

Pointing to tales as varied as Mary Shelley\u2019s 1818\nnovel Frankenstein and the 2014 film Ex Machina, he adds, \u201cIt is in these\nstories and scenarios that we play the role of God by creating new life out of\ninanimate matter. And it appears that the desire to actualize this outcome is\nso persistent and inescapable [that] we are willing to cheat and deceive\nourselves in order to make it a reality.\u201d\n\nEven before products such as ChatGPT and DALL-E kicked off the current\nartificial intelligence boom, this dynamic played out with less ambitious AI\nproducts. Consider X.ai, a company that once touted an automated personal\nassistant that could schedule meetings and send out e-mails. It turned out\nthat the reason X.ai\u2019s software seemed so lifelike was that it was literally\nalive, which Bloomberg reported in 2016: behind the scenes, human trainers\nwere reviewing almost all inbound e-mails. Other concierge and personal\nassistant programs from that era were similarly human-dependent, and\nBloomberg\u2019s report noted that the draw of venture capital may have\nincentivized start-ups to frame ordinary workflows as cutting-edge.\n\nIt\u2019s a dynamic that plays out across our increasingly online life. That food\ndelivery robot carting a salad to your front door might actually be a young\nvideo game enthusiast piloting it from afar. You might think a social media\nalgorithm is sifting out pornography from cat memes, when in reality human\nmoderators in an office somewhere are making the toughest calls.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a question of marketing appeal,\u201d Raicu says. \u201cIt\u2019s also a\nreflection of the current push to bring things to market before they actually\nwork as intended or advertised. Some companies seem to view the \u2018humans inside\nthe machine\u2019 as an interim step while the automation solution improves.\u201d\n\nIn recent months the hype around generative AI has created exciting new\nopportunities for people to mask workaday human labor under a shiny, PR-\nfriendly veneer of fauxtomation. Earlier this year, for instance, the Internet\nerupted in a furor over a posthumous George Carlin stand-up special that had\npurportedly simulated the late comic\u2019s sense of humor with a machine-learning\nprogram trained on his oeuvre. But later, under the threat of a lawsuit from\nCarlin\u2019s estate, one of the video\u2019s creators admitted through a spokesperson\nthat the supposedly AI-generated jokes had in fact been written by an ordinary\nperson.\n\nIt was the latest in a centuries-old tradition that continues to enchant and\nensnare unwary consumers: humans pretending to be machines pretending to be\nhumans once again.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nBrian Contreras is a freelance tech journalist who previously served as the\nLos Angeles Times' first artificial intelligence reporter.
