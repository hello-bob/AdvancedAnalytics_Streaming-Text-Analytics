Other investors include Founders Fund, Playground Global and Redpoint\nVentures.\n\nAustralia has been an early leader in quantum computing, investing in academic\nresources and establishing a national quantum strategy, with the goal of\nbuilding commercially viable quantum computers in the country.\n\nAD\n\nPete Shadbolt, a PsiQuantum co-founder (two are from Australia) and its chief\nscientific officer, told Semafor that Australia picked his company because it\nwas the most likely to reach a big enough scale to produce impactful results.\n\nHe noted the country has \u201cspent a lot of money on research and they got a lot\nof amazing papers and a lot of amazing demonstrations. But it\u2019s always been\nclear that in order to realize those benefits, you have to build a big, old,\nexpensive machine.\u201d\n\nIn this article:\n\n### The News\n\n### Know More\n\n### Reed\u2019s view\n\n### Room for Disagreement\n\n### Notable\n\n### Know More\n\nQuantum computers do not work like traditional computers. Instead of using\nmicroscopic transistors, which can represent either ones or zeros, they use\nparticles known as qubits.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike transistors, qubits can exist in multiple states at a time, allowing\nthem to perform different types of calculations. The theory of quantum\nentanglement allows many qubits to be linked, allowing for an even larger\nnumber of computations.\n\nTraditional computers are more or less limited by the laws of classical\nphysics; quantum computers are not.\n\nThere are several ways to make qubits, and popular methods include using\ntrapped ions or particles within superconductors.\n\nAD\n\nPsiQuantum believes the best approach is using individual photons as qubits,\nby manipulating single particles of light. While this is among the most\ndifficult methods of quantum computing, PsiQuantum made a bet that it was\nultimately the most practical for large scale quantum computers because of the\nexisting infrastructure built around photonics.\n\nIt has partnered with one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the\nworld, Global Foundries, to produce photonic computers with enough fidelity to\nwork with individual photons.\n\nAnother major advantage of using photons as qubits is that photons can operate\nat room temperature. Most other supercomputers require extremely cold\ntemperatures, making them impractical at scale.\n\nPsiQuantum\u2019s method still requires refrigeration, but not nearly as much as\nother methods. As a result, it plans to build its quantum computers inside\ncryogenic cabinets built by a company that makes meat lockers.\n\nThose units are then networked together to increase the total number of\nqubits. By the end of 2027, PsiQuantum plans to have a quantum computer with 1\nmillion qubits. The largest quantum computers today have about 1,000.\n\nWith 1 million qubits, PsiQuantum believes it can perform error correction,\nessentially making up for mistakes made by the qubits. Traditional computers\nalso require error correction, but in the case of quantum computers, the\nmajority of qubits are used for this task. Shadbolt said \u201cthat sucks, but\nthat\u2019s tough luck.\u201d\n\nNetworking the refrigerated units together was another hurdle for PsiQuantum.\nIt needed to achieve a breakthrough in photonic switching, essentially sending\nphotons back and forth with an unprecedented amount of fidelity, allowing very\nfew photons to escape.\n\nPsiQuantum revealed some of how it has achieved this in a paper that appeared\nonline Friday.\n\n### Reed\u2019s view\n\nAustralia\u2019s willingness to bet on PsiQuantum\u2019s ability to build a working\nquantum computer makes sense. Even if the company fails, the economic impact\nof attracting this kind of cutting edge technology will pay dividends in the\nlong run.\n\nWhen semiconductors were still nascent, Taiwan made a similar bet by\nsubsidizing the development of TSMC. Now, the island is among the most\ntechnologically advanced areas in the world.\n\nSouth Korea, the world\u2019s leader in R&D as a percentage of GDP, has a similar\nstory.\n\nAustralia, known more for mining than technology, stands to gain here.\n\nIf PsiQuantum is able to hit its target of a 1 million-qubit quantum computer\nby the end of 2027, then the next decade is going to see major, rapid\ntechnological development. Quantum computers will lead to immediate\nbreakthroughs in materials science and biotechnology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to usher in, we hope, a new decade in which human beings have\nmastery over chemistry and physics of the type they\u2019ve not had before,\u201d\nShadbolt said.\n\n### Room for Disagreement\n\nIn Australia, there\u2019s some pushback on the government\u2019s willingness to bet big\non a foreign company, even if it has some Australian DNA. James Riley of\nInnovationAus.com wrote: \u201cThe idea that Australia, having spent tens of\nmillions of public research dollars on quantum research over decades, would\ndrop $200 million or more on a foreign quantum startup that has made no\ninvestment in this country and no commitment to this country seems unhinged.\n\nFor Australia\u2019s quantum companies, it would be a disaster. It would have a\ncrippling effect on the ability of Australia\u2019s quantum hardware pioneers\u2019\nability to raise venture capital in international markets.\n\nEvery conversation with the specialist quantum VCs in the world would start\nwith trying to explain why your own government would make a signature NRF or\nFuture Made in Australia investment into a US company, rather than any kind of\ninvestment in your own company.\u201d\n\n### Notable\n\n  * It\u2019s not easy to write about quantum computing, in part because the technology is so far out there.
