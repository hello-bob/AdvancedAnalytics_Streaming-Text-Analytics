While standard subword tokenizers\n> compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much\n> higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over\n> neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and\n> serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main\n> obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque\n> outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that\n> text na\u00efvely compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by\n> LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression\n> technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the\n> same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over\n> neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-\n> level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed\n> benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword\n> tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the\n> benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer\n> autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide\n> extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and\n> offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of\n> high-compression tokenizers.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.03626 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.03626v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.03626arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Brian Lester [view email] [v1] Thu, 4 Apr 2024 17:48:28 UTC (320 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text, by\nBrian Lester and 6 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
