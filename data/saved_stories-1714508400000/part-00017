Microsoft, which owns OpenAI, and\nother tech giants have turned up in some states offering legislative guidance,\nbut Workday has been particularly active and influential, observers say.\n\nCivil liberties and workers\u2019 rights advocates say they are alarmed to see\nWorkday\u2019s outsized state-level success, particularly since AI tools deployed\nin the workplace can have a huge impact on real people by determining who gets\nhired, fired and promoted. The company\u2019s model legislation does nothing to\nprotect consumers or employees, the advocates say, while giving employers and\nother private entities nearly unchecked power to set workplace and other AI\nnorms with no independent audits.\n\nA top Workday lobbyist, Chandler Morse, has been interacting with state\nlawmakers for several months, and by his own account \u2014 given in late October\ntestimony to Maryland lawmakers \u2014 had at that point held \u201cactive\u201d discussions\nin at least five state capitals. Meanwhile, a second Workday executive\npresented the company\u2019s vision to a large \u201cmulti-state working group\u201d of\nlegislators convened by Connecticut state Sen. James Maroney on March 1, a\nWorkday spokesperson confirmed.\n\nA draft copy of Workday\u2019s model bill, which is marked confidential but has\napparently been shared widely with some state lawmakers and their aides,\ncontains language closely resembling central elements of AI bills introduced\nin California on February 15; Illinois on February 8; Rhode Island on February\n7; Connecticut on February 7; New York on January 8 and Washington state on\nJanuary 8.\n\nA Workday spokesperson said the company did not lobby on AI governance issues\nin either Rhode Island or Illinois.\n\nOctober 25, 2023, hearing on AI by a Maryland General Assembly committee,\nincluding Chandler Morse, vice president for corporate affairs for Workday.\n\nThe Connecticut bill is still being refined, Maroney said, but, as with\nothers, currently includes key language that matches the Workday model nearly\nverbatim. Maroney told Recorded Future News that he considered Workday\u2019s ideas\nafter executives there sent him their model bill.\n\nMaroney also was the lead sponsor for a dominant model of industry-friendly\ndata privacy legislation passed in Connecticut and later copied in many other\nstates, partially thanks to Maroney\u2019s stewardship over the same \u201cmulti-state\nworking group\u201d focused on harmonizing approaches between states, an effort he\nis replicating for AI legislation.\n\nWashington State Rep. Clyde Shavers said he collaborated with Workday and a\nvariety of other tech companies on his bill, and also spoke to a California\nlegislator who just introduced a bill shaped with Workday\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cIt's important to collaborate among legislatures so that we don't have\nopposing or discrete legal regimes that may be difficult or challenging for\nentities dealing with artificial intelligence to really fully comply with,\u201d\nShavers said in an interview.\n\nNone of the other relevant lawmakers responded to a request for comment.\n\nDespite Morse\u2019s outreach in Maryland, no bill has been introduced there.\n\n### The perils of \u2018automated decision tools\u2019\n\nWorkers\u2019 rights and civil liberties advocates say \u201cautomated decision tools,\u201d\nor software that uses artificial intelligence to make decisions, can be\ndangerous if not aggressively regulated.\n\nWorkday is at the center of a current court case that underscores why\nadvocates are concerned. The company is being sued by Derek Mobley, a Black\nman over age 40 who claims he has been rejected by more than 100 jobs he\napplied for using Workday\u2019s AI-based hiring software.\n\nMobley alleges that Workday\u2019s automated system is \u201cmuch more likely to deny\napplicants who are African-American, suffer from disabilities and/or are over\nthe age of 40,\u201d according to an amended complaint for the class action lawsuit\nagainst the company filed in a California federal court last month. (A Workday\nspokesperson said the lawsuit \u201cis without merit\u201d).\n\nAdvocates for workers say cases like Mobley\u2019s highlight why AI regulation\nneeds to be very carefully written. And they point to several examples of\nlanguage in the state bills that parallel the Workday model, which they say\nwill leave workers unprotected.\n\nParticularly worrisome, they say, is a line borrowed from Workday\u2019s template\nthat appears with very slight wording differences in at least six states\u2019\nlegislation, suggesting that the bill\u2019s regulations would only apply to an\nautomated decision tool that has been \u201cspecifically developed and marketed to,\nor specifically modified to be the controlling factor in making a\nconsequential decision.\u201d\n\nThe problem, critics say, is that without independent audits, no company is\ngoing to admit to using automated tools as a controlling, or dominant, factor\nin employment decisions. If a company isn\u2019t using the technology as a\ncontrolling factor when making decisions then, under Workday\u2019s language,\nregulations don\u2019t apply.\n\n\u201cIt creates a loophole that swallows the entire law,\u201d said Matt Scherer,\nsenior policy counsel for workers' rights and technology at the Center for\nDemocracy and Technology, an advocacy group focused on digital rights.\n\nThe language, paired with the lack of audits, \u201cmakes it much harder for\nsomeone to challenge when a deployer is saying that the AI system is exempt\nfrom the law,\u201d said Hayley Tsukayama, associate director of legislative\nactivism at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group focused on\ndefending civil liberties in a digital world.\n\nIn fact, she said, as long as an employer states regulations don\u2019t apply\nbecause they aren\u2019t using workplace AI as a \u201ccontrolling factor,\u201d the employer\ndoesn\u2019t even need to tell workers an AI tool has been deployed at all under\nthe spate of new laws inspired by Workday\u2019s widely circulated model.\n\nThe Workday model, and the state bills it has inspired, also don\u2019t give\nworkers the right to sue if they feel AI has harmed them, said Cody Venzke,\nsenior policy counsel at the ACLU.\n\n\u201cMost people expect that if they're discriminated against in employment that\nthey can sue,\u201d Venzke said.\n\n### In the game since 2019\n\nA Workday spokesperson said the company\u2019s interest in these issues isn\u2019t new.\nIt has been \u201chelping lay the groundwork for AI regulation since 2019,\u201d the\nspokesperson said in a prepared statement, adding that Workday is committed to\nboth \u201cresponsible AI and enabling innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe it is important to differentiate between those decisions in which\nthe AI is a controlling factor from those in which an informed human is in the\nloop and leveraging AI-driven insights, remaining in control, and is\naccountable for a final decision,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWhen asked how the public can hold corporations accountable without\nindependent audits, the Workday spokesman said impact assessments, which\nappear instead of audits in the Workday model legislation as well as in the\nstate laws referenced above, are a \u201ctried and tested tool.\u201d\n\nThe Workday spokesperson pointed to the fact that the California law just\nintroduced with the company\u2019s support would mandate the state attorney general\nand Civil Rights Department to oversee compliance.\n\nCritics say state attorneys general and other public offices lack the\nbandwidth and, often the expertise, to effectively police the use of AI in\nevery workplace in a given state. Impact assessments will not be effective\nwithout independent review, they say.\n\n\u201cThe distinction is that an audit is conducted by a theoretically impartial\nthird party, whereas under these bills in California, Connecticut and other\nstates, impact assessments can be done by the company that is deploying or\ndeveloping the AI system \u2014 with all of the potential conflicts of interest\nthat such self-assessment creates,\u201d Scherer said.\n\nMany of the bills under consideration also contain loopholes that will allow\ncompanies to avoid providing consumers and workers with notice about how the\ntechnology will be used, Scherer said, calling it \u201cthe overarching No. 1\nproblem with all of these bills.\u201d\n\n### A heavyweight gains traction\n\nWorkday, which earned $6.2 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023 and is used by\nmore than half of Fortune 500 companies, has been urging state lawmakers to\nfocus on \u201charmonizing\u201d state bills, Morse told Maryland lawmakers in October.\n\nAsked about Morse\u2019s drumbeat of state lobbying in recent months, the Workday\nspokesperson said in a statement that the company shares \u201cour expertise with\npolicymakers to support in the development of responsible AI guardrails.\u201d\n\nWorkday lobbyists have even earned hat tips from state legislators unveiling\nbills.\n\nWhen California Assembly Member Rebecca Bauer-Kahan introduced her version of\nautomated decision tools AI legislation last month, she quoted Morse in a\npress release announcing the bill.\n\nIn the release, Morse hailed Bauer-Kahan\u2019s legislation and said Workday was\n\u201cpleased to have contributed to its development.\u201d A Microsoft executive also\nwas quoted offering support for the bill in the release.\n\nMorse has urged other lawmakers to follow Bauer-Kahan\u2019s lead and act quickly.\n\nSettling on a common model \u201cas different jurisdictions start to think about\nhow to move forward is going to be key so that this regulatory strategy\ndoesn't collapse under its own weight,\u201d Morse told Maryland lawmakers in\nOctober.\n\nAt an AI hearing in Washington state in December a Workday lobbyist, Jarrell\nCook, joined executives from Microsoft and Salesforce in testifying about how\nto consider AI regulation.\n\nCook told Washington lawmakers the company has spoken with state and federal\nlawmakers and also advocated for its vision for AI regulation on the\ninternational stage.\n\n\u201cWorkday has prioritized working with policymakers that are seeking to\nregulate AI and align with the vision that we have, making sure that it's\ndeployed and developed responsibly,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe know that most lawmakers\nare not running for office thinking about AI as often as we do.\u201d\n\n  * Privacy\n  * Technology\n  * Government\n  * Industry\n  * News\n\nGet more insights with the\n\nRecorded Future\n\nIntelligence Cloud.\n\nLearn more.\n\nTags\n\n  * artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * software\n  * legislation\n  * civil liberties\n  * business\n  * California\n  * Illinois\n  * Connecticut\n  * Washington state\n  * New York\n  * Maryland\n  * Rhode Island\n  * regulation\n  * states\n\nPrevious articleNext article\n\nCanadian city says timeline for recovery from ransomware attack \u2018unknown\u2019\n\nRansomware gang claims to have made $3.4 million after attacking children\u2019s\nhospital\n\nSuzanne Smalley\n\nis a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for\nThe Record.
