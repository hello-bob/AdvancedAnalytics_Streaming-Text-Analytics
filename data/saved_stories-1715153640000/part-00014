Taft\n\nFeature image via Unsplash.\n\nVOXPOP\n\nTry our new 5 second poll. It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nShould IBM Open Source Terraform?\n\nShould IBM donate the soon-to-be-acquired HashiCorp Terraform to the Linux\nFoundation?\n\nYes, a vendor-neutral group like the Linux Foundation is the way to go.\n\nYes, but to Apache, FSF or another less corporate-friendly open source\ngoverning body.\n\nNo, IBM just spent $6.4 billion on HashiCorp. Why give away the code for free?\n\nNo, The Linux Foundation already has the code (\"OpenTofu\")\n\nI don\u2019t use Terraform. It\u2019s none of my business where the code goes.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nMicrosoft has donated $1 million to The Rust Foundation to do whatever it sees\nfit.\n\nMicrosoft, a Rust Foundation Platinum Member, made an unrestricted donation in\nDecember 2023 to help the organization advance the performance, safety, and\nsustainability of the Rust programming language.\n\nHowever, the announcement of the donation was delayed because the foundation\nneeded time to democratically decide how to best allocate the funds to support\nthe Rust maintainers and the language itself, Dr. Rebecca Rumbul, the Rust\nFoundation\u2019s executive director and CEO, told The New Stack.\n\n## Two Years\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s donation will be invested over a two year period and applied to\nhigh-priority areas of need in the Rust ecosystem, including hiring an\nadditional Rust Foundation infrastructure engineer (now closed to\napplications), funding the Rust Foundation\u2019s capstone \u201cFellowship\u201d program,\nand developing new systems and programs to support the work of Rust Project\nmaintainers and reduce workload strain, Rumbul said.\n\nIn January 2024, the Rust Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors approved a motion to\nput $350,000 of this funding towards employing a new Infrastructure Engineer\nfor two years, and to ringfence $650,000 for the Rust Project to directly fund\npriorities of their choosing over a period of two years.\n\nThe Rust Foundation spent the first quarter of 2024 in close collaboration\nwith the Rust Foundation Project Directors and the Rust Project Leadership\nCouncil to identify the most pressing areas of need within the Rust Project.\nThe Leadership Council is currently considering a plan that would involve\nusing a large portion of the first $325,000 reserved for the Rust Project to\nmake key process improvements, including the development of new collaboration\nmechanisms to help support maintainer workflow efficiency.\n\n\u201cBy making this unrestricted $1M contribution to the Rust Foundation,\nMicrosoft has demonstrated its ongoing commitment to the Rust programming\nlanguage, the Rust Foundation\u2019s stewardship, and the Leadership Council\u2019s\nstatus as an advocate for the wider Rust Project,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\u201cThe Rust Foundation looks forward to supporting emerging priorities within\nthe Project, in addition to hiring a second Infrastructure Engineer and\ncontinuing our direct support of Rust maintainers through the Fellowship\nprogram.\u201d\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1.

However, this Microsoft donation is\ndifferent.\n\nFor one thing, it came to the foundation a couple of months before Google\u2019s\ndonation, and it was for the foundation to choose what to do with the funding.\n\n\u201cThis donation is different from Google\u2019s $1 million donation, which was\nspecifically earmarked for studying the interoperability between C++ and\nRust,\u201d Rumbul said.\n\nThat two major tech vendors are investing in Rust says a lot, according to\nBrad Shimmin, an analyst at Omdia.\n\nHe argues that two companies that have their own vested interests in the likes\nof C#/TypeScript and Golang, all strongly typed languages are donating to the\nRust language is significant.\n\n\u201cI honestly think this sort of investment points to two important thoughts.\nFirst it underscores the value of the Rust language, which has found its way\ninto many important projects, such as the Linux kernel itself. Even though the\nlanguage may be difficult to learn, it has proven Itself to be well suited to\nsoftware that operates close to the hardware, delivering both performance and\nstability,\u201d Shimmin told The New Stack. \u201cAnd second, I think it calls\nattention to the need for guidance and stability within the Rust community\nitself, which has proven to be somewhat volatile over the last year or two.\u201d\n\n## Safety and Security\n\nMeanwhile, Rumbul said memory safety and secure programming have been key to\norganizations adopting Rust.\n\n\u201cI feel like two or three years ago and before that, no one was really talking\nabout security like now, as security was always kind of a bolt-on after the\nfact,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas now the attitude has shifted, and you should be\nbuilding secure software by default. You need to be baking in security at the\ntime of coding.\u201d\n\nRumbul mentioned directives from organizations like the Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the White House looking at Rust due\nto its focus on security and performance.\n\n\u201cCloud providers need memory-effective code \u2014 and this one of the Rust\nfortes,\u201d said Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research. \u201cAnd Rust\nis just popular with developers, as it is \u2018the most loved language,\u2019\u201d\naccording to Stack Overflow, he said. \u201cIt makes sense as a foundation member\nfor Microsoft to be a good citizen.\u201d\n\nOverall, the unrestricted donation from Microsoft is seen as a significant\nvote of confidence in the Rust Foundation and its ability to effectively\nsupport and grow the Rust ecosystem.\n\nDarryl K.
