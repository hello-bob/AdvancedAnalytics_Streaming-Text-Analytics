The role scientists play in expanding the\nfrontiers of human knowledge. The opportunities scientists have to speak on\nimportant issues. And so on.\n\nIf you\u2019re an actor, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell me about the power that theatre has\nto express ideas. The unique role that actors play in bringing stories to life\nfor people. The opportunities actors have to speak on important issues. And so\non.\n\nIf you\u2019re a doctor, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll tell me about the miracle of lifesaving\nmedicine. The challenges that you alleviate from peoples lives every day. The\nopportunities doctors have to speak on important issues. And so on.\n\nBut this is misdirection.\n\nThese are myths. Not because they aren\u2019t true, but because they came after you\ndecided what you wanted to do, not before. The purpose they serve is one: for\nthe world, most especially you, to feel like what you do is important.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe story begins when you were around 4, starting to figure yourself out. In\nkindergarten, you excelled at some things, and not at most others. To\ndistinguish yourself (to feel special and important), you identified with your\nstrengths. These strengths gave you the ticket to compete in a dominance\nhierarchy; a status structure built around achievement in a specific domain.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine you were a better-than-average writer. The teachers told your\nparents what great stories you wrote. You could be the next Tolkien! You never\nheard of Tolkien before, and he wouldn\u2019t have been important to you even if\nyou had. But this makes you special now. So, you spurn all other pursuits as\ninferior to you, and make writing your \u201cthing\u201d. The rest of your life is\nconsumed by success in this domain. This is the dominance hierarchy you chose\nto make yourself feel important.\n\nTo reinforce your participation in a dominance hierarchy, you immerse yourself\ninto the myths built around this dominance hierarchy by your fellow travelers.\nAll of those flowery reasons why people like to say they\u2019re in the career\nthey\u2019re in, all those claims to the supposed intrinsic value of the thing. The\ntrue purpose is to breath intrinsic value into something a group of people are\nbetter than the rest of society at. You, being a member of this group, thus\nbenefit in perpetuating these myths.\n\nAll of this happens without you even realizing it, because you didn\u2019t have to\ninvent any of it yourself. It was already there. The many dominance\nhierarchies in the world surrounding different skillsets already existed, and\nthe myths that are built up around them were well storied by generations of\ndominance hierarchy climbers. Your parents, your teachers, your peers,\nthemselves already self-enslaved to these dominance hierarchies, offer you the\nchains when they witness your strengths. You happily clasp them onto your\nwrists.\n\nLet\u2019s summarize your career in a flowchart.\n\nChild has ego \u2192 wants to be important \u2192 demonstrates a certain talent \u2192\nidentifies a dominance hierarchy predicated on that talent \u2192 consumes the\nmythology of the intrinsic importance of that dominance hierarchy, storied by\ngenerations of those who climbed it \u2192 spend your life climbing to the top of\nthat dominance hierarchy.\n\nEveryone has some kind of skillset/competency/passion. Every\nskillset/competency/passion has an associated dominance hierarchy (many even).\nEvery dominance hierarchy has a self-justifying myth.\n\nSomeone might object that this is actually normal, and that I\u2019m just framing\nlife in an overly cynical way. But no; believing in myths is wrong and\nunhealthy. Spending your life climbing semi-contrived dominance hierarchies\nand lying to yourself with its myths is a waste of life. We should not spend\nour lives enslaved to our own egos, latching onto a dominance hierarchy,\nendlessly proving to the world how important and relevant we are. We should\nchoose the kind of work that we think we can genuinely make the greatest\nimpact doing. That which Allah, not our egos, would be most pleased with.\n\nBesides, these thoughts aren\u2019t original. I first read about them from Ted\nKaczynski of all people, except instead of \u2018dominance hierarchy\u2019 he used the\nterms \u2018power process\u2019 and \u2018surrogate activity\u2019.\n\nLife looks very different once you adopt this outlook. One unsettling\ncorollary is that, because every dominance hierarchy is set up for the same\npurpose, they are in some sense interchangeable. The striving actor,\nscientist, or doctor, are really the same kind of person motivated by the\nexact same thing. They are all just striving to ascend a dominance hierarchy.\nThe details of their domain are irrelevant; it\u2019s all about asserting their\nimportance within their dominance hierarchy and by extension to wider society.\nThey all buy into a myth that gives value to the dominance hierarchy they\nderive their importance from, and they all exert their strength to climb it.\nEven though we may think of theatre and science as two very different things:\nwhen it comes to the motivations of the rats in the race, they\u2019re just\ndifferent vehicles driving on the same road.\n\n### Subscribe to Muslim Musings\n\nBy Abu Ibrahim \u00b7 Launched 2 years ago\n\nReflections about and around Islam.\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Everything is Dominance Hierarchies\n\nmuslimmusings.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nDon't Sacrifice Your Advantage\n\nMy chess opponents were doing something I couldn't explain\n\nAug 20, 2022 \u2022\n\nAbu Ibrahim\n\n2\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Don't Sacrifice Your Advantage\n\nmuslimmusings.substack.com\n\n4\n\nPublic Speaking vs. Arrogance\n\nAn Attempt at Reconciliation\n\nJun 20, 2022 \u2022\n\nAbu Ibrahim\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Public Speaking vs. Arrogance\n\nmuslimmusings.substack.com\n\nNorth Vs.
