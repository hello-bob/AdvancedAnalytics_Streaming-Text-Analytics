Made by the Swiss manufacturer Stadler and known\nas the FLIRT (for \u201cFast Light Intercity and Regional Train\u201d), it will soon be\nshipped to Southern California, where it is slated to carry riders on San\nBernardino County\u2019s Arrow commuter rail service before the end of the year. In\nthe insular world of railroading, this hydrogen-powered train is a Rorschach\ntest. To some, it represents the future of rail transportation. To others, it\nlooks like a big, shiny distraction.\n\nIn the quest to decarbonize the transportation sector\u2014the largest source of\ngreenhouse-gas emissions in the United States\u2014rubber-tired electric vehicles\ntend to dominate the conversation. But to reach the Biden administration\u2019s\ngoal of net-zero emissions by 2050, other forms of transportation, including\nthose on steel wheels, will need to find new energy sources too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best way to decarbonize railroads is the subject of growing debate among\nregulators, industry, and activists. Things are coming to a head in\nCalifornia, which recently enacted rules requiring all new passenger\nlocomotives operating in the state to be zero-emissions by 2030 and all new\nfreight locomotives to meet that threshold by 2035. Federal regulators could\nbe close behind.\n\nThe debate is partly technological, revolving around whether hydrogen fuel\ncells, batteries, or overhead electric wires offer the best performance for\ndifferent railroad situations. But it\u2019s also political: a question of the\nextent to which decarbonization can, or should, usher in a broader\ntransformation of rail transportation. For decades, the government has largely\ndeferred to the will of the big freight rail conglomerates. Decarbonization\ncould shift that power dynamic\u2014or further entrench it.\n\nSo far, hydrogen has been the big technological winner in California. Over the\npast year, the California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans, has\nordered 10 hydrogen FLIRT trains at a cost of $207 million. After the Arrow\nservice, the next rail line to receive hydrogen trains is scheduled to be the\nValley Rail service in the Central Valley. That line will connect Sacramento\nto California High-Speed Rail, the under-construction system that will\neventually link Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nIn its analysis of different zero-emissions rail technologies, Caltrans found\nthat hydrogen trains, powered by onboard fuel cells that convert hydrogen into\nelectricity, had better range and shorter refueling times than battery-\nelectric trains, which function much like electric cars. Hydrogen was also a\ncheaper power source than overhead wire (or simply \u201celectrification,\u201d in\nindustry parlance), which would cost an estimated $6.8 billion to install on\nthe state\u2019s three main intercity routes. (California High-Speed Rail and its\nshared track on the Bay Area\u2019s Caltrain commuter service will both be powered\nby overhead wire, since electrification is necessary to reach speeds of over\n100 miles per hour.)\n\n## Related Story\n\nWhen hydrogen will help climate change\u2014and when it won\u2019t.\n\nHydrogen could be key to addressing climate change, but where it comes from\nwill matter.\n\nFurther complicating the electrification option, installing overhead wire on\nthe rest of California\u2019s passenger network would require the consent of BNSF\nand Union Pacific, the two major freight rail carriers that own most of the\nstate\u2019s tracks. The companies have long opposed the installation of wire above\ntheir tracks, which they say could interfere with double-stacked freight\ntrains.\n\nElectrifying all 144,000 miles of the nation\u2019s freight rail tracks would cost\nhundreds of billions of dollars, according to a report by the Association of\nAmerican Railroads (AAR), an industry trade group, and even electrifying\nsmaller sections of track would result in ongoing disruptions to train traffic\nand shift freight customers from trains to trucks, the group claims.\nElectrification would also require the cooperation of electric utilities,\nleaving railroads vulnerable to the grid connection delays that plague\nrenewable-energy developers.\n\n\u201cWe have long stretches of track outside of urbanized areas,\u201d says Marcin\nTaraszkiewicz, an engineer at the engineering and architecture firm HDR who\nhas worked on Caltrans\u2019s hydrogen train program. Getting power to those rugged\nplaces can be a challenge, he says, especially when infrastructure must be\ndesigned to resist natural disasters like wildfires and earthquakes: \u201cIf that\nwire goes down, you\u2019re going to be in trouble.\u201d\n\nThe AAR thinks California\u2019s railroad emissions regulations are too much, too\nsoon, especially given that freight rail is already three to four times more\nfuel efficient than trucking. Last year, the AAR sued the state over its\nlatest railroad emissions regulations, in a case that is still pending. Though\nthe group generally prefers hydrogen to electrification as a long-term\nsolution, it contends that this alternative technology is not yet mature\nenough to meet the industry\u2019s needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA group called Californians for Electric Rail also views hydrogen as an\nimmature technology. \u201cFrom an environmental as well as a cost perspective,\nit\u2019s a really circular and indirect way of doing things,\u201d says Adriana Rizzo,\nthe group\u2019s founder, who is an advocate for electrifying the state\u2019s regional\nand intercity tracks with overhead wire.\n\nSynthesizing, transporting, and using the tiny hydrogen molecule can be very\ninefficient. Hydrogen trains currently require roughly three times more energy\nper mile than trains powered by overhead wire. And the environmental benefits\nof hydrogen\u2014the ostensible purpose of this new technology\u2014remain largely\ntheoretical, since the vast majority of hydrogen today is produced by burning\nfossil fuels like methane. Natural-gas utilities have been among the hydrogen\nindustry\u2019s biggest boosters, because they are already able to produce and\ntransport the gas.\n\nOpinions on the merits of hydrogen trains have been mixed. In 2022, following\na pilot program, the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg determined that this\ntechnology would be 80% more expensive to operate over the long run than other\nzero-emissions alternatives.\n\nKyle Gradinger, assistant deputy director for rail at Caltrans, thinks there\u2019s\nbeen some \u201cTwittersphere exaggeration\u201d about the problems with hydrogen\ntrains. In tests, the hydrogen-powered Stadler FLIRT is \u201cperforming as well as\nwe expected, if not better,\u201d he says. Since they also use electric motors,\nhydrogen trains offer many of the same benefits as trains powered by overhead\nwire, Gradinger says. Both technologies will be quieter, cleaner, and faster\nthan diesel trains.\n\nCaltrans hopes to obtain all the hydrogen for its trains from zero-emissions\nsources by 2030\u2014a goal bolstered by a draft clean-hydrogen rule issued by the\nBiden administration in 2023. California is one of seven \u201chydrogen hubs\u201d in\nthe US, public-private partnerships that will receive billions of dollars in\nsubsidies from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for developing\nhydrogen technologies. It\u2019s too early to say whether Caltrans will be able to\nprocure funding for its hydrogen fueling stations and supply chains through\nthese subsidies, Gradinger says, but it\u2019s certainly a possibility. So far,\nCalifornia is the only US state to have purchased hydrogen trains.\n\nAdvocates like Rizzo fear, however, that all this investment in hydrogen\ninfrastructure will get in the way of more transformative changes to passenger\nrail in California.\n\n\u201cWhy are we putting millions of dollars into buying new trains and putting up\nall of this infrastructure and then expecting the same crappy service that we\nhave now?\u201d Rizzo says. \u201cThese systems could carry so many more passengers.\u201d\n\nRizzo\u2019s group, and allies like the Rail Passenger Association of California\nand Nevada, think decarbonization is an opportunity to install the type of\ninfrastructure that supports the vast majority of fast passenger train\nservices around the world. Though the up-front investment in overhead wire is\nhigh, electrification reduces operating costs by providing constant access to\na cheap and efficient energy source. Electrification also improves\nacceleration so that trains can travel closer together, creating the potential\nfor service patterns that function more like an urban metro system than a\nonce-per-day Amtrak route.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaltrans has a long-term plan to dramatically increase rail service and\nspeeds, which might eventually require electrification by overhead wire, also\nknown as a catenary system. But at least for the next couple of decades, the\nagency believes, hydrogen is the most feasible way to meet the state\u2019s\nambitious climate goals. The money, the political will, and the stomach for a\nfight with the freight railroads and utility companies just aren\u2019t there yet.\n\n## Related Story\n\nMeet the divers trying to figure out how deep humans can go\n\nFiguring out how the human body can withstand underwater pressure has been a\nproblem for over a century, but a ragtag band of divers is experimenting with\nhydrogen to find out.\n\n\u201cThe gold standard is overhead catenary electrification, if you can do that,\u201d\nGradinger says. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t going to get to a level of service on the\nintercity side for at least the next decade or two that would warrant\ninvestment in electrification.\u201d\n\nRizzo hopes that as the federal government puts more railroad emissions\nregulations in place, the case for electrifying rail by overhead wire will get\nstronger. Other countries have come to that conclusion: a 2015 policy change\nin India resulted in the electrification of nearly half the country\u2019s track\nmileage in less than a decade. The United Kingdom\u2019s Decarbonising Transport\nPlan states that electrification will be the \u201cmain way\u201d to decarbonize the\nrail industry.\n\nThese changes are still compatible with a robust freight industry. The world\u2019s\nmost powerful locomotives are electric, pulling ore-laden freight trains in\nSouth Africa and China. In 2002, Russia finished electrifying the 5,700-mile\nTrans-Siberian Railway, demonstrating that freight trains running on electric\nwire can travel very long distances over very harsh terrain.\n\nThings may be starting to shift in the US as well, albeit slowly. BNSF appears\nto have softened its stance against electrification on a corridor it owns in\nSouthern California, where it has agreed to allow California High-Speed Rail\nto construct overhead wire on its right of way. Rizzo and her group are\nlooking to make these projects easier by sponsoring state legislation\nexempting overhead wire from the California Environmental Quality Act. That\nwould prevent situations like a 2015 environmental lawsuit from the affluent\nBay Area suburb of Atherton, over tree removal and visual impact, that delayed\nCaltrain\u2019s electrification project for nearly two years.\n\nNew innovations could blur the lines between different kinds of green rail\ntechnologies. Caltrain has ordered a battery-equipped electrified train that\nhas the potential to charge up while traveling from San Francisco to San Jose\nand then run on a battery onward to Gilroy and Salinas. A similar system could\nsomeday be deployed in Southern California, where trains could charge through\nthe Los Angeles metro area and run on batteries over more remote stretches to\nSanta Barbara and San Diego.\n\nNew hydrogen technologies could also prove transformative for passenger rail.\nThe FLIRT train doing laps in the Colorado desert is version 1.0. In the\nfuture, using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier could result in much longer range\nfor hydrogen trains, as well as more seamless refueling. \u201cWith hydrogen,\nthere\u2019s a lot more room to grow,\u201d Taraszkiewicz says.\n\nBut in a country that has invested little in passenger rail over the past\ncentury, new technology can only do so much, Taraszkiewicz cautions. America\u2019s\nrailroads all too often lack passing tracks, grade-separated road crossings,\nand modern signaling systems. The main impediment to faster, more frequent\npassenger service \u201cis not the train technology,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s everything\nelse.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Schneider is a freelance writer covering housing, transportation, and\nurban policy.\n\n### by Benjamin Schneider\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
