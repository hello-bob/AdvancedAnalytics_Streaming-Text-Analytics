Internet Archive Lawsuit | Internet Archive Blogs\n\n# Internet Archive Blogs\n\n## A blog from the team at archive.org\n\n# Internet Archive Stands Firm on Library Digital Rights in Final Brief of\nHachette v. Internet Archive Lawsuit\n\nPosted on April 19, 2024 by Chris Freeland\n\nToday, the Internet Archive has taken a decisive final step in our ongoing\nbattle for libraries\u2019 digital rights by submitting the final appellate reply\nbrief [PDF] in Hachette v. Internet Archive, the publishers\u2019 lawsuit against\nour library. This move reaffirms Internet Archive\u2019s unwavering commitment to\nfulfilling our mission of providing universal access to all knowledge, even in\nthe face of steep legal challenges.\n\n## READ THE FINAL APPELLATE REPLY BRIEF\n\nStatement from Brewster Kahle, founder and digital librarian of the Internet\nArchive: \u201cResolving this should be easy\u2014just sell ebooks to libraries so we\ncan own, preserve and lend them to one person at a time. This is a battle for\nthe soul of libraries in the digital age.\u201d\n\nThis process has taken nearly four years to work through the legal system, and\nin that time we\u2019ve often fielded the question, \u201cWhy should I care about this\nlawsuit?\u201d By restricting libraries\u2019 ability to lend the books they own\ndigitally, the publishers\u2019 license-only business model and litigation\nstrategies perpetuate inequality in access to knowledge.\n\nThroughout this legal battle, Internet Archive has remained steadfast in our\nmission to defend the core values of libraries\u2014preservation, access, and\neducation. This fight is not just about protecting the Internet Archive\u2019s\ndigital lending program; it\u2019s about standing up for the digital rights of all\nlibraries and ensuring that future generations have equal access to the wealth\nof knowledge contained within them.\n\nPosted in Books Archive, Lending Books, News | Tagged CDL, controlled digital lending, lawsuit | Leave a reply\n\n## About Chris Freeland\n\nChris Freeland is the Director of Library Services at Internet Archive.\n\nView all posts by Chris Freeland \u2192\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### Latest Posts\n\n  * Internet Archive Stands Firm on Library Digital Rights in Final Brief of Hachette v.
