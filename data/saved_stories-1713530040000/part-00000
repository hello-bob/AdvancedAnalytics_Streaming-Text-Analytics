A collection of diseases, including neuropathy and dementia, neuroHIV\ncan cause problems with memory and thinking and compromise our ability to live\na normal life.\n\nUsing a mouse model of neuroHIV, a research team led by biomedical scientists\nat the University of California, Riverside, studied the effects of\ninterferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2), a small protein involved in cell signaling and integral\nto the body\u2019s natural defense mechanism against viral infections. The\nresearchers found that higher or lower than normal levels of IFN\u03b2 affect the\nbrain in a sex-dependent fashion: some changes only occur in females, others\nonly in males.\n\nMarcus Kaul, a professor of biomedical sciences in the School of Medicine who\nled the study, explained that when infection-induced IFN\u03b2 levels become high,\nthe brains of females and males are protected. If IFN\u03b2 production in response\nto infection is absent or too low, HIV can compromise brain function right\naway in both females and males, he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, IFN\u03b2 also controls other cell and brain functions,\u201d Kaul said. \u201cIf\nIFN\u03b2 is absent, females display reduced nerve cell connections called\ndendrites in the cerebral cortex, while males show diminished \u2018presynaptic\nterminals,\u2019 another type of nerve cell connection, in the hippocampus.\u201d\n\nDendrites are highly branched structures that increase the receptive surface\nof neurons.\n\n\u201cParadoxically, in the hippocampus of females and males, the damage to\npresynaptic terminals by HIV is diminished when IFN\u03b2 is absent but the\nreduction of injury is more pronounced in males,\u201d Kaul said.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the work adds to scientists\u2019 understanding of\nhow innate immunity affects the brain during chronic HIV infection.\n\n\u201cUntil now, it was not known that normal levels of IFN\u03b2 are required for\nnormal memory function and that the absence of IFN\u03b2 changes the production of\nnerve cell components in a sex-dependent fashion,\u201d Kaul said.\n\nThe findings, published in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, are\nnoteworthy because the mouse model of neuroHIV that Kaul and his team used\nshares key features of brain injury and compromised function, such as impaired\nmemory, with people living with HIV infection, or PLWH.\n\nAlmost all cells in the body can produce IFN\u03b2. Kaul explained IFN\u03b2 regulates\nthe production of inflammatory factors in neuroHIV and has two major effects:\n(a) it changes the state of a virally infected cell from \u2018normal\u2019 to \u2018anti-\nviral,\u2019 making the cells uncomfortable environments for the virus, even\ncompletely shutting down virus production, and (b) IFN\u03b2 is released from\ninfected cells as well as specialized cells that, by sensing infected cells,\ncan alert neighboring cells and the entire body of a viral infection.\n\n\u201cThis is how neighboring cells adapt to become more resistant to viral\ninfection,\u201d Kaul said. \u201cSome of them will also release additional anti-viral\nfactors and a mixture of other factors that can promote or limit inflammation,\nsuch as cytokines called CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5.\u201d\n\nThe research was performed in Kaul\u2019s laboratory. The team generated a new\nvariant of an established transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV by crossbreeding\nthis model with mice that lack IFN\u03b2. The team then analyzed memory function\nand brain tissue of the transgenic mice for injury that usually occurs in\nneuroHIV.\n\n\u201cHIV and some other viruses have developed mechanisms to reduce or even\nprevent the production of more than normal levels of IFN\u03b2,\u201d said Hina Singh,\nan assistant project scientist in Kaul\u2019s lab and the first author of the\nresearch paper. \u201cWe know little about the role of IFN\u03b2 in the human brain\nbeyond that it can reduce inflammation. This is a major reason why IFN\u03b2 is\nused to treat multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that affects more than\n2.8 million people worldwide. Currently, we have almost no information about\nhow much IFN\u03b2 is present in the brains of PLWH and what it does there.\u201d\n\nSingh said the study underscores the importance of having normal levels of\nIFN\u03b2 during no viral infection and having sufficiently high levels of IFN\u03b2 in\ncase of neuroHIV or other viral infections.\n\n\u201cThe body\u2019s many anti-viral responses observed in HIV infection are not\nspecific to HIV but also occur with other viral infections,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in\ncontrast to most other viral infections, the body cannot get rid of HIV, which\ndiminishes the effectiveness of the natural IFN\u03b2 response.\u201d\n\nNext, the team plans to work on confirming the findings of the neuroHIV model\nin PLWH.\n\n\u201cFor this, we will need to investigate tissues of PLWH who consented to donate\nthem for research after death,\u201d Kaul said. \u201cUltimately, we hope to develop\nIFN\u03b2 into a therapy for patients with neuroHIV.\u201d\n\nThe study was funded by grants to Kaul from the National Institutes of Health.\nKaul and Singh were joined in the research by scientists at UCR and The\nScripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.\n\nThe title of the research paper is \u201cInterferon-\u03b2 deficiency alters brain\nresponse to chronic HIV-1 envelope protein exposure in a transgenic model of\nNeuroHIV.\u201d The paper is scheduled to appear in print in May 2024.\n\n##### Second related study\n\nAnother study from the Kaul lab is scheduled to appear in print in the May\n2024 issue of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.\n\n\u201cThis study adds another important aspect to our understanding of how innate\nimmunity and an inflammatory mechanism affects the brain during chronic HIV\ninfection,\u201d Kaul said.\n\nThe study shows that intact HIV and its viral envelope protein gp120 each\ncause macrophages, a type of white blood cell, to release cysteinyl\nleukotrienes, or CysLTs, which are pro-inflammatory mediators. The study shows\nfor the first time that the CysLTs are critical components of macrophage\nneurotoxicity induced by HIV-1, the most common of the two major types of HIV.\n\n\u201cThe potential translational value of our work is the demonstration that an\nasthma drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration, that inhibits a\nmajor receptor for CysLTs also prevents HIV-induced neurotoxicity,\u201d Kaul said.\n\nThe research paper is titled \u201cA critical role for Macrophage-derived\nCysteinyl-Leukotrienes in HIV-1 induced neuronal injury.\u201d Nina Yuan, a former\nassociate specialist researcher in the Kaul lab, is the paper\u2019s lead author.\nThis study was supported by funds from the National Institute of Health.\n\nHeader photo shows Hina Singh (left) and Marcus Kaul.
