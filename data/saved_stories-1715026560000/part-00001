The suit is based on the current pressure\nsuits worn by astronauts on Crew Dragon flights but, unlike those suits, is\nintended for use on spacewalks.\n\nThe suit upgrades include new joint designs that remain soft until pressurized\nwhile maintaining mobility, improved thermal management, and an upgraded\nhelmet with an exterior coating that acts like a sun visor along with a camera\nand heads-up display that provides information on the status of the suit\nduring the spacewalk. Umbilicals provide life support for the suits.\n\nThe suits will first be worn on the Polaris Dawn mission, a Crew Dragon\nprivate spaceflight that is part of the Polaris program of missions backed by\nbillionaire Jared Isaacman. He will fly on that mission with Kidd Poteet,\nSarah Gillis and Anna Menon. All four will wear the suits because Crew Dragon,\nlacking an airlock, will have to be depressurized for the spacewalk.\n\nGillis said in a discussion hosted by SpaceX on social media May 4 that the\nspacewalk would last about two hours, including the time depressurizing the\ncabin at the start and repressurizing it at the end. Two people will exit the\ncapsule, using a device called a \u201cskywalker\u201d at the front hatch with handholds\nand interfaces to assist them in going through the hatch.\n\nThe spacewalkers will go through a \u201ctest matrix\u201d to collect data on the\nperformance of the EVA suits. \u201cThis is looking at mobility, movement in this\nmicrogravity environment, how the suit is performing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a\nwhole series of test questions that will be stepped through for the time\noutside the spacecraft.\u201d\n\nThe suits have been extensively tested on the ground, including a test where\nthe entire Crew Dragon capsule was placed in a vacuum chamber and the cabin\ndepressurized with four \u201cspacesuit simulators\u201d inside. \u201cThat all worked as\nexpected,\u201d said Stu Keech, vice president of Dragon at SpaceX. \u201cThat\u2019s\nequivalent to the uncrewed Demo-1 flight\u201d of Crew Dragon in 2019.\n\nThe spacewalk also required modifications to Dragon itself, such as a\nrepressuization system to restore cabin pressure after the spacewalk and\nchanging some materials based on their outgassing properties. \u201cThe interior is\ngoing to look a little different when you see pictures of us sitting in the\nspacecraft,\u201d Gillis said.\n\nThe suits will also be used as the pressure suits worn during launch and\nreentry on typical Crew Dragon missions. SpaceX plans to eventually combine\nthe two suits into a single one, with some changes already incorporated into\npressure suits starting with the Crew-6 mission based on what the company\nlearned developing the EVA suits.\n\n\u201cThe goal of this suit is to be our first design of the EVA suit, and then,\njust like all over SpaceX products, we\u2019re going to continue through block\nupgrades as we go forward and learn,\u201d Keech said.\n\n#### Polaris Dawn plans\n\nThe spacewalk is a key part of the upcoming Polaris Dawn mission, and\ndevelopment of the spacesuits had been a pacing factor for that flight, once\nplanned for late 2022 but delayed several times since then.\n\nPolaris Dawn is now scheduled for early summer, and SpaceX expressed\nconfidence that the schedule would hold. \u201cPolaris Dawn is the next major\noperation for the Dragon program,\u201d Keech said. \u201cRight now the whole team is\ndriving towards a launch date in early summer of this year.\u201d\n\nThe Falcon 9 launching the Polaris Dawn mission will place the Crew Dragon\nspacecraft into an elliptical orbit of 190 by 1,200 kilometers, Menon said.\nThe spacecraft will then raise its apogee to 1,400 kilometers, the highest\naltitude for a crewed mission since the Apollo 17 crewed mission in 1972.\n\nDragon will remain at that apogee for about seven orbits, collecting data on\nthe increased radiation environment, before lowering to 700 kilometers. That\nis the altitude at which the mission will conduct the EVA. The mission will\nremain in orbit for five days, Isaacman said, conducting experiments and\ntesting the ability of the spacecraft to communicate through SpaceX\u2019s Starlink\nconstellation.\n\nThe flight profile, with the higher altitude and the spacewalk, brings with it\nnew risks. Keech said SpaceX had evaluated both the radiation and\nmicrometeroid/orbital debris impact risk for this flight profile. \u201cThe Polaris\nDawn mission, for both of those, will be within the risk that we accept for a\nsix-month ISS mission,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re not\nunnecessarily taking risks, but you do have to expand the envelope and do it\nmethodically.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly are briefed constantly on where the differences are between our\nmission and a normal profile,\u201d Isaacman said, \u201cand feel really comfortable\nthey\u2019ve been addressed.\u201d\n\n### Related\n\n#### Polaris Dawn private astronaut mission slips to mid-2024\n\nA private astronaut mission that will feature the first spacewalk from a Crew\nDragon spacecraft has suffered another delay, this time to at least the middle\nof this year.\n\n#### Collins performs tests of new space station spacesuit\n\nCollins Aerospace, one of the companies with a NASA award to develop a new\ngeneration of spacesuits, has completed a series of tests of that design in a\nmicrogravity environment on an aircraft.\n\n#### Polaris Dawn rescheduled for April\n\nThe first flight of the Polaris program of private astronaut missions is now\nscheduled for no earlier than next April, a delay of nearly a year and a half\nfrom its original plan.\n\nTagged: Crew Dragon, Polaris Program, spacesuit, SpaceX\n\n## Jeff Foust\n\nJeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for\nSpaceNews.
