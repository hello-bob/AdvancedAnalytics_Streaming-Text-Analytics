A variety of scientific and industrial domains, including\ngeosciences, climate science, manufacturing, and other initiatives within the\nEuropean HPC and scientific applications ecosystem, will benefit from this\ninnovative technology, reflecting the wide-reaching and transformative impact\nof the project.\n\nThe two major project outcomes, High-Performance Computing Workflows as a\nService (HPCWaaS) and the project software stack, are crucial in supporting\nthe development, deployment and execution of complex workflows. These\nadvancements play a key role in tackling challenges related to natural\ndisasters, climate change and the optimization of manufacturing processes.\nHPCWaaS helps users and developers to manage complex scientific workflows by\nsimplifying their lifecycle steps and widening the access to HPC for\nnewcomers. Additionally, the project has released as open source the\neFlows4HPC software stack, which is versatile and applicable across numerous\nscientific and industrial applications requiring HPC, AI and big data\ntechniques.\n\nRosa M. Badia, coordinator of the \u20ac7,6M eFlows4HPC project, said that \u201cthe\nachieved results mark a significant milestone, demonstrating the versatility\nof the eFlows4HPC software stack in leveraging HPC resources. This translates\nto a notable decrease in time-to-solution for application developers that need\nto combine traditional HPC with AI or big data in a single workflow.\u201d She\nthinks that \u201cwe are shaping the future of HPC workflows and empowering\nresearchers to tackle emerging challenges that require complex workflows.\u201d\n\neFlows4HPC consortium, coordinated by the Barcelona Supercomputig Center, has\nbeen highly engaged with multiple initiatives in order to ensure broader\nadoption of the eFlows4HPC methodologies by other scientific and industrial\ncommunities. Joint collaboration activities have been organized with other\nEuropean initiatives and HPC Centers of Excellence (CoEs), such as ESiWACE3\n(climate and weather simulations) and PerMedCoE (personalized medicine)\ncommunities. The project has also supported ChEESE and ChEESE-2P by developing\ncomplex workflows for earthquake impact simulation. eFlows4HPC methodologies\nwill also be used for the development of workflows in DT-GEO, that aims to\nbuild a digital twin for geophysical extremes, and the CAELESTIS project.\nFinally, the SKA Regional Centres, the regional support network for the\ninternational initiative providing square-kilometre array telescopes, showed\ninterest in evaluating the HPCWaaS methodology.\n\n  * tweet\n  * share\n  * share\n  * share\n  * email\n\nFiled Under: HPC Software, News Tagged With: Barcelona Supercomputing Centre,\nBSC, eFlows4HPC, hpc workflows\n\n#### Sponsored Guest Articles\n\n### Kickstart Your Business to the Next Level with AI Inferencing\n\n{SPONSORED GUEST ARTICLE] Check out this article form HPE (with NVIDIA.)
