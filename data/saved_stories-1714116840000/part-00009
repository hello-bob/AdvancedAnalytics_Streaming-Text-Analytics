They are on a continual search for the perfect diet, the\nperfect work routine, the perfect travel setup.\n\nOptimizing can take quite a bit of time and energy.\n\nWhat would happen if we let go of optimizing? Who would we be without the idea\nthat we should optimize everything?\n\nOne idea is that if we decided not to optimize everything, we\u2019d stop caring,\nstop trying to make things better, and live suboptimal lives. But I know\nmyself pretty well \u2013 I will always care, even if I am not trying to optimize.\nI will always do my best, which is different than optimizing \u2013 it\u2019s taking\ncare and giving love, even if things aren\u2019t optimized. I believe most of you\nare this way, pouring your hearts into something with pure love, without\nneeding to make everything perfect.\n\nSo why shouldn\u2019t we optimize? And what would it be like if we didn\u2019t?\n\nGive me a few moments to make the case against optimizing, and present an\nalternative way.\n\n### The Case Against Optimizing\n\nI don\u2019t think people who optimize are idiots (many of the smartest people do\nit), nor is it a life-ruining thing to try to optimize. I\u2019ve done it many\ntimes.\n\nBut consider:\n\n  1. The savings never get realized. When you try to optimize, you are spending some of your precious life moments trying to find the perfect setup. Sure, once you\u2019re done, things will theoretically be set up perfectly from then on, so over the long run you should save a lot of time and effort, right? Well, first, let\u2019s acknowledge that there\u2019s a big cost to optimizing up front. And the savings would only be realized after running the optimal system or method for a good while. Unfortunately most people who optimize don\u2019t just set it up and forget it \u2013 they continue to try to optimize over and over. It\u2019s a never-ending quest, so the cost keeps adding up but the savings never catches up.\n  2. Optimizing is a trap of dissatisfaction. Optimizing is the quest for something as close to perfect as you can get it. But that\u2019s an unrealistic ideal. It doesn\u2019t really exist. And we\u2019ll never get to optimal \u2013 when we get close, we\u2019ll continue the habit of being dissatisfied with the way things are. We\u2019ll have put in a lot of work, but then not be happy. Because the search for perfect is a trap, where you\u2019re strengthening the mental habit of dissatisfaction.\n  3. Optimizing is a focus on what\u2019s not important. Coming up with the perfect productivity system, the perfect todo list software \u2013 it\u2019s not important. It\u2019s procrastination on the things that are truly important. The tasks at the top of the todo list you already have, that you\u2019re not working on, so that you can optimize. Coming up with the perfect diet system isn\u2019t important \u2013 eating vegetables is. Eating nuts and beans and fruits is important. Forget the rest, just do that. Coming up with the perfect vacation isn\u2019t important \u2013 you\u2019re missing out on what\u2019s right in front of you, there at home, when you are trying to optimize your next trip.\n  4. Even if you could optimize, such a perfect life would suck. Let\u2019s imagine for a moment that you could spend a week optimizing every single thing in your life. Everything is now perfect, most things are automated, life because ridiculously easy. (Hint: it\u2019s not possible.) Even if were possible to make life this perfect, life would absolutely suck. If everything ran easily, you would never appreciate any accomplishments, because they came too easily. Nothing would be earned, nothing would feel amazing. People run ultramarathons not because they are perfect and ideal and easy, but because they are such a struggle. The struggle makes it meaningful. Sure, get some good tools, learn how to do things well ... but don\u2019t worry about a little extra work. Don\u2019t worry about don\u2019t something a few too many times. A little repetition helps you to get really good at something. A little difficulty helps you to really learn something. A little irritation helps you to find patience, let go of ideals and love things as they are.\n  5. Optimizing is a good way to get things to break. Imagine that you optimized a series of software tools so they all ran perfectly together, a huge complicated structure of connected machines ... amazing work, well engineered, well thought-out. But when things are optimized like this, they are fragile. If one thing breaks, the others do too. If your life is optimized, it\u2019s easy to break. To give you another example ... let\u2019s say you have an optimized sleep routine. It\u2019s amazing, and you get great sleep this way! But then you have to fumigate your house, so you have to sleep at a relative\u2019s house. Your entire optimized routine is thrown off, so you get horrible sleep for a few days. Then you try to optimize your sleep for travel, getting a great setup for sleeping on the plane and trains. Then your favorite sleep mask, ear plugs (or noise-canceling headphones) and travel pillow get stolen. No sleep! The most optimized thing to do, then, is to not optimize \u2013 get good at dealing with everything, from sleeping on trains without any kind of setup to sleeping on the ground. Unoptimize your life by getting good at dealing with unoptimal situations. Throw randomized craziness into your life. Forget about optimizing, and learn flexibility, learn to deal, learn to let go, learn to adapt.\n  6. Optimizing is a distraction. It\u2019s like cleaning the decks when the Titanic is sinking. It\u2019s not important that you optimize. It\u2019s important that you are present, that you learn to be mindful, to be compassionate, to work from a place of love, to let go of your attachments, to see your interconnectedness with others. To be pure love, and to give your gift to the world. Not what todo software you use, not what bulletproof coffee you drink, not what perfect backpack you carry. Don\u2019t get caught up in the distractions \u2013 focus on what truly matters.\n\nSo what\u2019s an alternative way? There isn\u2019t one way, of course, but I\u2019ll share\nsome ideas.\n\n### An Alternative Way\n\nConsider a different way of being:\n\n  1. Instead of optimizing your schedule, pick one thing to do and focus fully on it. Do it with all of your heart, out of love. When you\u2019re done, give a bow of gratitude. Take a moment to pause and not rush to the next thing. Repeat.\n  2. Instead of trying to find the perfect software, the perfect tool, the perfect travel clothes ... focus on being content with where you are, who you are, what you have, what is in front of you right now. Contentment is much more important than getting to perfect.\n  3. Instead of building a fragile optimized routine, system or setup ... give yourself less-than-optimal situations, randomness, things you need to adapt to. Develop flexibility, agility, adaptability, robustness, antifragility.\n  4. Be present. Appreciate the fleeting moment, because there won\u2019t be many more before you die. Be fully immersed in the moment, cherishing the beauty of this life.\n  5. When you find yourself with the urge to optimize and find the perfect setup, recognize that you\u2019re letting yourself be distracted from what\u2019s important. Then ask yourself, \u201cWhat\u2019s most important right now?\u201d Focus on that, even if it gives you discomfort and makes you want to run. Get good at that, rather than good at optimizing.\n  6. Let your path be less controlled, more random. Let it be filled with messiness, because that\u2019s how you adapt to messiness. Let it be filled with chaos, because then you can find peace in the middle of chaos. Let it be filled with the joy of life exactly as it is, because that\u2019s optimal. What is. Not what you wish it could be.\n\nAnd do it with a smile and joy in your heart. What a life we have been gifted\nwith!\n\nPrevious post: How to Be Mindful All the Time\n\nNext post: Fearlessness: How to Stop Running from Space\n\n# Life-changing training programs and live experiences\n\n# from Zen Habits:\n\nTransformation, One Change at a Time\n\nOpen to Something Meaningful\n\nCultivate Deep Focus in the Face of Resistance\n\n## Join 2,000,000 breath-taking readers:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
