interest in doing a $26 billion takeover of the company.\n  * A Skydance consortium could hear from a Paramount special committee on a recommendation of next steps as soon as Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.\n  * Some Paramount investors have clamored for the board to engage with Apollo and Sony rather than take the Skydance deal, because all common shareholders would get a premium for their shares.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * PARA\n\nShari Redstone, non-executive chairwoman of Paramount Global, attends the\nAllen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, July 11,\n2023.\n\nDavid A. Grogan | CNBC\n\nSony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management have sent a\nletter to the Paramount Global board expressing interest in acquiring the\ncompany for about $26 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe expression of formal interest comes as David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media,\nbacked by private equity firms RedBird Capital and KKR, awaits word from\nParamount\u2019s special committee on whether the panel will recommend its bid to\nacquire the company to controlling shareholder Shari Redstone.\n\nSkydance Media hasn\u2019t heard anything from the special committee yet, though it\nexpects to find out the special committee\u2019s recommendations on next moves as\nearly as Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount\u2019s\npanel could recommend approving Skydance\u2019s offer or rejecting it, or it could\ncome back to the Skydance consortium with alternatives or changes.\n\nSpokespeople for Paramount, Redstone\u2019s National Amusements, the special\ncommittee and Skydance declined to comment. Sony and Apollo did not\nimmediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n## Paramount\u2019s options\n\nIf the special committee wants to continue negotiating with Skydance, or\nRedstone wants more time to consider her options while still talking to\nEllison\u2019s company, the sides could extend an exclusivity window that ends\nFriday. It\u2019s also possible Skydance could walk away from the deal, which it\nhas been negotiating on for months.\n\nIf Skydance walks away, Redstone could turn her attention to negotiating a\ndeal with Sony and Apollo, which would give all common shareholders a premium\npayout on their shares.\n\nParamount Global shares jumped more than 12% on the news that Sony and Apollo\nsubmitted a letter formalizing its interest, earlier reported by The New York\nTimes and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRedstone initially rejected an offer by Apollo in favor of exclusive talks\nwith Skydance. Redstone still prefers a deal that would keep Paramount\ntogether, as Skydance\u2019s offer would, a person familiar with the matter said. A\nprivate equity firm would likely tear the company apart through a series of\ndivestitures to extract value.\n\nThe Sony-Apollo offer would make the former the majority shareholder and the\nlatter a minority holder, according to a person familiar with the letter. That\ncould also assuage Redstone\u2019s fears that a new buyer could break apart the\ncompany, because Sony is another large Hollywood player and the owner of Sony\nPictures.\n\nA $26 billion offer for Paramount Global values the company higher than the\ncompany\u2019s current $22 billion enterprise value.\n\nStill, the special committee would likely want to review details on financing\nand get assurances that there are no regulatory challenges in merging with\nSony, a non-U.S. entity. To do this, the special committee would have to\ninform the Skydance consortium that it wants to end its exclusive talks, which\nwould likely drive Skydance away as a bidder, according to people familiar\nwith the matter.\n\nThat move would be applauded by a number of Class B shareholders, including\nGamco, Matrix Asset Advisors and Aspen Sky Trust, who have all publicly\nexpressed dismay about the Skydance transaction. Skydance\u2019s \u201cbest and final\u201d\noffer included merging its entertainment assets with Paramount, raising $3\nbillion to buy out common shareholders at about a 30% premium on an unaffected\n$11 per share price, and paying Redstone nearly $2 billion for her controlling\nstake.\n\nRedstone could also argue she\u2019s more comfortable with pushing forward at\nParamount Global without a sale. Earlier this week, the board removed Bob\nBakish as the company\u2019s CEO. Installing a new CEO and giving investors a new\nplan forward would be essential to assuage a restless common shareholder base,\nwho would likely argue the Apollo-Sony bid, if real, is in the best interest\nof shareholders.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Thursday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Ferrari, Netflix, Tesla, Nvidia, TJX, Carvana & more\n  * Bank of America says this shoe stock is an inflation winner and you should buy it before earnings\n  * These are Morgan Stanley\u2019s top picks into quarterly earnings\n  * Tesla price cuts could backfire, fund manager says, warning of a \u2018huge demand problem\u2019 on the horizon\n  * Gundlach sees one rate cut this year as Fed keeps up inflation fight\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
