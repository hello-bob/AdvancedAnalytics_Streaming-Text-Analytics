The maximum recorded\nweight was 190 tonnes for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres (91 ft), whereas\nlonger ones, up to 33.6 metres (110 ft), have been recorded but not\nweighed.^[1]^[2]^[3] It is estimated, this individual could have a mass of 250\ntonnes or more.^[4]^[5]^[6] The longest non-colonial animal is the lion's mane\njellyfish (37 m, 120 ft).^[7]\n\nIn 2023, paleontologists estimated that the extinct whale Perucetus,\ndiscovered in Peru, may have outweighed the blue whale, with a mass of 85 to\n340 t (94\u2013375 short tons; 84\u2013335 long tons).^[8] However more recent studies\nsuggest this whale was much smaller than previous estimates putting its weight\nat 60 to 113 tonnes.^[9] While controversial, estimates for the weight of the\nsauropod Bruhathkayosaurus suggest it was around 110\u2013170 tons, with the\nhighest estimate being 240 tons, if scaled with Patagotitan, although actual\nfossil remains no longer exist, and that estimation is based on described\ndimensions in 1987.^[10] The upper estimates of weight for these two\nprehistoric animals would have easily rivaled or exceeded the blue whale.\n\nThe African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) is the largest living land\nanimal. A native of various open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, males weigh\nabout 6.0 tonnes (13,200 lb) on average.^[11] The largest elephant ever\nrecorded was shot in Angola in 1974. It was a male measuring 10.67 metres\n(35.0 ft) from trunk to tail and 4.17 metres (13.7 ft) lying on its side in a\nprojected line from the highest point of the shoulder, to the base of the\nforefoot, indicating a standing shoulder height of 3.96 metres (13.0 ft). This\nmale had a computed weight of 10.4 to 12.25 tonnes.^[1]\n\n## Heaviest living animals[edit]\n\nThe heaviest living animals are all whales.

At the\nhighest estimates, this would make Perucetus the heaviest known animal in\nhistory.^[8]\n\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant. The largest\nextinct land mammal known was long considered to be Paraceratherium\norgosensis, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 4.8 m (15.7 ft)\ntall, measured over 7.4 m (24.3 ft) long and may have weighed about 17\ntonnes.^[59]^[60] In 2015, a study suggested that one example of the\nproboscidean Palaeoloxodon namadicus may have been the largest land mammal\never, based on extensive research of fragmentary leg bone fossils from one\nindividual, with a maximum estimated size of 22 tonnes.^[61]^[59]\n\n### Stem-mammals (Synapsida)[edit]\n\nLisowicia bojani, likely the biggest non-mammal synapsid ever, compared to a\nhuman\n\nThe Late Triassic Lisowicia bojani, from what is now southern Poland, probably\nwas the largest of all non-mammalian synapsids (most of which became extinct\n250 million years ago), at 4.5 m (15 ft) in length, 2.6 m (8.5 ft) in height\nand 9 t (20,000 lb) in weight.^[62] However, one study suggested a more\nconservative weight of 4.87 tonnes to 7.02 tonnes for the adult taxon, with an\naverage body mass of 5.88 tonnes.^[63] The largest carnivorous synapsid was\nAnteosaurus at 5\u20136 m (16\u201320 ft) and 500\u2013600 kg (1,100\u20131,300 lb).^[64]\n\nCaseasaurs (Caseasauria)\n\n    The herbivorous Alierasaurus was the largest caseid and the largest amniote to have lived at the time, with an estimated length around 6\u20137 m (20\u201323 ft).^[65] Another huge caseasaur is Cotylorhynchus hancocki, with an estimated length and weight of at least 6 m (20 ft)^[66] and more than 500 kg (1,100 lb).^[67]\nSphenacodontids (Sphenacodontidae)\n\n    The biggest carnivorous synapsid of Early Permian was Dimetrodon, which could reach 4.6 m (15 ft) and 250 kg (550 lb).^[68] The largest members of the genus Dimetrodon were also the world's first fully terrestrial apex predators.^[69]\nTappenosaurids (Tappenosauridae)\n\n    The Middle Permian Tappenosaurus was estimated at 5.5 m (18 ft) in length which is comparable in size with the largest dinocephalians.^[70]\nTherapsids (Therapsida)\n\n    The plant-eating dicynodont Lisowicia bojani is the largest-known of all non-mammalian synapsids, at 4.5 m (15 ft) and 9,000 kg (20,000 lb).^[62]^[71]^[72] The largest carnivorous therapsid was the aforementioned Anteosaurus from what is now South Africa during Middle Permian epoch. It reached 5\u20136 m (16\u201320 ft) long, and about 500\u2013600 kg (1,100\u20131,300 lb) in weight.^[64]\n\n### Reptiles (Reptilia)[edit]\n\nMain article: List of largest reptiles\n\nThe saltwater crocodile is the largest living reptile.\n\nThe largest living reptile, a representative of the order Crocodilia, is the\nsaltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) of Southern Asia and Australia, with\nadult males being typically 3.9\u20135.5 m (13\u201318 ft) long. The largest confirmed\nsaltwater crocodile on record was 6.32 m (20.7 ft) long, and weighed about\n1,360 kg (3,000 lb).^[1] Unconfirmed reports of much larger crocodiles exist,\nbut examinations of incomplete remains have never suggested a length greater\nthan 7 m (23 ft).^[73] Also, a living specimen estimated at 7 m (23 ft) and\n2,000 kg (4,400 lb) has been accepted by the Guinness Book of World\nRecords.^[74] However, due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very\nlarge living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions has yet to be\nverified. A specimen named Lolong caught alive in the Philippines in 2011\n(died February 2013) was found to have measured 6.17 m (20.2 ft) in\nlength.^[75]^[76]^[77]^[78]^[79]\n\nThe Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the \"Komodo monitor\",\nis a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca,\nFlores, Gili Motang, Nusa kode and Padar. A member of the monitor lizard\nfamily (Varanidae), it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a\nmaximum length of more than 3 metres (9.8 feet) in rare cases and weighing up\nto approximately 166 kilograms (366 pounds).^[80]\n\n#### Largest living reptiles[edit]\n\nThe following is a list of the largest living reptile species ranked by\naverage weight, which is dominated by the crocodilians.

The tallest and heaviest sauropod known from a complete skeleton is a specimen of an immature Giraffatitan discovered in Tanzania between 1907 and 1912, now mounted in the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde of Berlin. It is 12\u201313.27 m (39.4\u201343.5 ft) tall and weighed 23.3\u201339.5 tonnes.^[114]^[115]^[116]^[117]^[118]^[119] The longest is a 25 m (82 ft) long specimen of Diplodocus discovered in Wyoming, and mounted in Pittsburgh's Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907. A Patagotitan specimen found in Argentina in 2014 is estimated to have been 37\u201340 m (121\u2013131 ft) long and 20 m (66 ft) tall, with a weight of 69\u201377 tonnes.^[120]^[121]\n    There were larger sauropods, but they are known only from a few bones. The current record-holders include Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed 100 tonnes; Supersaurus which might have reached 34 m (112 ft) in length and Sauroposeidon which might have been 18 m (59 ft) tall. Some abnormal specimens such as specimen BYU 9024 of the Barosaurus genus could reach an astounding 45-48 meters long, with mass varying from the 'modest' 60-66 tons to the more immense 92-120 tons.^[122]^[123]^[124] Two other such sauropods include Bruhathkayosaurus and Maraapunisaurus. Both are known only from fragments that no longer exist. Bruhathkayosaurus might have been between 40\u201344 m (131\u2013144 ft) in length and 175\u2013220 tonnes in weight according to some estimates, with recent estimates being place between 110-170 tons.^[125]^[10] Maraapunisaurus might have been approximately 35\u201340 m long and 80\u2013120 tonnes or more.^[126] Each of these two 'super-sauropods' would have easily rivalled the largest blue whale in size.^[10]^[12]\nRank| Animal| Average mass [tonnes]| Maximum mass [tonnes]| Average total\nlength [m (ft)]  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1| Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi| 110-170^[10]| 240^[10]| 44.1 (144.6)^[127]^[128]  \n2| Maraapunisaurus fragillimus| 80-120^[129]| 150^[130]| 35-40 (115-131)^[129]  \n3| Barosaurus lentus BYU 9024| 60-66^[122]^[123]^[131]^[132]| 92-120^[124]|\n45-48 (148-157)^[132]  \n4| Argentinosaurus huinculensis| 75-80^[117]| 100^[117]^[133]| 35\u201339.7\n(115\u2013130)^[117]^[134]  \n5| Mamenchisaurus| 50-80^[135]| 80^[135]| 26\u201335 (85\u2013115)^[135]  \n6| Notocolossus gonzalezparejasi| 44.9\u201375.9^[133]| 75.9^[133]| 28 (92)^[133]  \n7| Patagotitan mayorum| 55-69^[136]| 77^[136]| 33\u201337 (108\u2013121)^[136]  \n8| Puertasaurus reuili| 50-60^[137]| 60| 27-30 (89-98)^[138]^[139]^[140]  \n9| Sauroposeidon proteles| 40-60^[141]| 60^[141]| 27\u201334\n(89\u2013112)^[141]^[137]^[142]  \n10| Dreadnoughtus schrani| 22.1\u201359.3^[143]| 59.3^[143]| 26 (85)^[133]^[143]  \n  \nTheropods (Theropoda)\n\n    The largest theropod known from a nearly complete skeleton is the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex specimen, nicknamed \"Sue\", which was discovered in South Dakota in 1990 and now mounted in the Field Museum of Chicago at a total length of 12.3 m (40 ft). Body mass estimates have reached over 9,500 kg,^[144] though other figures, such as Hartman's 2013 estimate of 8,400 kg,^[145] have been lower.\n    Another giant theropod is Spinosaurus aegyptiacus from the mid-Cretaceous of North Africa. Size estimates have been fluctuating far more over the years, with length estimates ranging from 12.6 to 18 m and mass estimates from 7 to 20.9 t.^[146]^[147] Recent findings favor a length exceeding 15 m ^[148] and a body mass of 7.5 tons.^[149]\n    Other contenders known from partial skeletons include Giganotosaurus carolinii (est. 12.2\u201313.2 m and 6-13.8 tonnes) and Carcharodontosaurus saharicus (est. 12-13.3 m and 6.2-15.1 tonnes).^[147]^[150]^[151]^[152]^[153]^[122]\n    The largest extant theropod is the common ostrich (see birds, below).\nArmored dinosaurs (Thyreophora)\n\n    The largest thyreophorans were Ankylosaurus and Stegosaurus, from the Late Cretaceous and Late Jurassic periods (respectively) of what is now North America, both measuring up to 9 m (30 ft) in length and estimated to weigh up to 6 tonnes.^[154]^[155]\nOrnithopods (Ornithopoda)\n\n    The largest ornithopods were the hadrosaurids Shantungosaurus, a late Cretaceous dinosaur found in the Shandong Peninsula of China, and Magnapaulia from the late Cretaceous of North America. Both species are known from fragmentary remains but are estimated to have reached over 15 m (49 ft) in length^[156]^[157] and were likely the heaviest non-sauropod dinosaurs, estimated at over 23 tonnes.^[157]\nCeratopsians (Ceratopsia)\n\n    The largest ceratopsians were Triceratops and its ancestor Eotriceratops from the late Cretaceous of North America. Both estimated to have reached about 9 m (30 ft) in length^[158] and weighed 12 tonnes.^[159]^[160]\n\n#### Birds (Aves)[edit]\n\nMain article: List of largest birds\n\nThe common ostrich is the largest living bird.\n\nThe largest living bird, a member of the Struthioniformes, is the common\nostrich (Struthio camelus), from the plains of Africa. A large male ostrich\ncan reach a height of 2.8 m (9.2 ft) and weigh over 156 kg (344 lb).^[161] A\nmass of 200 kg (440 lb) has been cited for the common ostrich but no wild\nostriches of this weight have been verified.^[162] Eggs laid by the ostrich\ncan weigh 1.4 kg (3.1 lb) and are the largest eggs in the world\ntoday.^[citation needed]\n\nThe largest bird in the fossil record may be the extinct elephant birds\n(Aepyornithidae) of Madagascar, which were related to the kiwis. Aepyornis\nexceeded 3 m (9.8 ft) in height and 500 kg (1,100 lb), while Vorombe could\nreach a similar height and a mass of 732 kg (1,614 lb).^[163] The last of the\nelephant birds became extinct about 300 years ago. Of almost exactly the same\nupper proportions as the largest elephant birds was Dromornis stirtoni of\nAustralia, part of a 26,000-year-old group called mihirungs of the family\nDromornithidae.^[164] The largest carnivorous bird was Brontornis, an extinct\nflightless bird from South America which reached a weight of 350 to 400 kg\n(770 to 880 lb) and a height of about 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in).^[165] The tallest\ncarnivorous bird was Kelenken, which could reach 3 to 3.2 meters in height and\n220 to 250 kilograms. The tallest bird ever was the giant moa (Dinornis\nmaximus), part of the moa family of New Zealand that went extinct around 1500\nAD. This particular species of moa stood up to 3.7 m (12 ft) tall,^[161] but\nweighed about half as much as a large elephant bird or mihirung due to its\ncomparatively slender frame.^[1]\n\nThe heaviest bird ever capable of flight was Argentavis magnificens, the\nlargest member of the now extinct family Teratornithidae, found in Miocene-\naged fossil beds of Argentina, with a wingspan up to 5.5 m (18 ft), a length\nof up to 1.25 m (4.1 ft), a height on the ground of up to 1.75 m (5.7 ft) and\na body weight of at least 71 kg (157 lb).^[1]^[166]^[167] Pelagornis sandersi\nis thought to have had an even larger wingspan of about 6.1\u20137.4 m (20\u201324 ft),\nbut is only about 22\u201340 kg (49\u201388 lb), half the mass of the\nformer.^[168]^[167]\n\n##### Heaviest living bird species[edit]\n\nThe following is a list of the heaviest living bird species based on maximum\nreported or reliable mass, but average weight is also given for comparison.\nThese species are almost all flightless, which allows for these particular\nbirds to have denser bones and heavier bodies.

Formerly considered conspecific with the Chinese giant salamander (A.\ndavidianus), the maximum size of this nearly human-sized river-dweller is 64\nkg (141 lb) and almost 1.83 m (6.0 ft).^[1] Before amniotes became the\ndominant tetrapods, several giant amphibian proto-tetrapods existed and were\ncertainly the dominant animals in their ecosystems. The largest known was the\ncrocodile-like Prionosuchus, which reached a length of 9 m (30 ft).^[179]\n\nFrogs (Anura)\n\nThe massive and destructive cane toad ranks as the largest toad in the world.\n\n    The largest member of the largest order of amphibians is the African goliath frog (Conraua goliath). The maximum size this species is verified to attain is a weight of 3.8 kg (8.4 lb) and a snout-to-vent length of 39 cm (15 in).^[1] The largest of the toads, the cane toad (Rhinella marina), is also the second largest member of the frog order. This infamous, often invasive species can grow to maximum mass of 2.65 kg (5.8 lb) and measure a maximum of 33 cm (13 in) from snout-to-vent.^[1] Rivaling the previous two species, the African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus adspersus) can range up to a weight of 2 kg (4.4 lb) and 25.5 cm (10.0 in) from snout to vent.^[180] Another large frog is the largest frog in North America, the American bullfrog, which can reach weights of up to 0.8 kg (1.8 lb) and snout-to-vent-length (SVL) of 20 cm (7.9 in). However, the toad Beelzebufo ampinga, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era in what is now Madagascar, was estimated to grow to 41 cm (16 in) long and weigh up to 4.5 kg (9.9 lb), making it the largest frog ever known.^[181] But in more recent studies, animals of this species have been estimated to have grown to at least 23.2 cm (9.1 in) (snout-vent length), which is around the size a modern African bullfrog can reach.^[182] The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (Litoria infrafrenata), the females of which can reach a length of 14 cm (5.5 in) from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115 g (4.1 oz).^[183] The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members. The largest is the Surinam horned frog (Ceratophrys cornuta), which can reach 20 cm (7.9 in) in length from snout to vent and weigh up to 0.48 kg (1.1 lb).^[184] While not quite as large as Ceratophrys cornuta, Leptodactylus pentadactylus is often heavier; it can reach 18.5 cm (7.3 in) long and weigh 0.60 kilograms (1.3 pounds). The largest dendrobatid is the Colombian golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), which can attain a length of 6 cm (2.4 in) and nearly 28.3 g (1.00 oz).^[185] Most frogs are classified under the suborder Neobatrachia, although nearly 200 species are part of the suborder Mesobatrachia, or ancient frogs. The largest of these are the little-known Brachytarsophrys or Karin Hills frogs, of South Asia, which can grow to a maximum snout-to-vent length of 17 cm (6.7 in) and a maximum weight of 0.54 kg (1.2 lb).^[186]\nCaecilians (Gymnophiona)\n\n    The largest of the worm-like caecilians is the Colombian Thompson's caecilian (Caecilia thompsoni), which reaches a length of 1.5 m (4.9 ft), a width of about 4.6 cm (1.8 in) and can weigh up to about 1 kg (2.2 lb).^[1]\nSalamanders (Urodela)\n\n    Besides the previously mentioned Chinese and South China giant salamanders, the closely related Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) is also sometimes cited as the largest living amphibian, but salamanders of a greater size than 1.53 m (5.0 ft) and 36 kg (79 lb) have never been verified for this species. Another giant of the amphibian world is the North American hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis), which can measure up to 0.76 m (2.5 ft). The recently described reticulated siren of the southeastern United States rivals the hellbender in size, although it is more lean in build.^[187] The largest of the newts is the Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), which can grow up to 30 cm (12 in) in length.^[188]\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\nMain article: List of largest fish\n\n## Invertebrate chordates[edit]\n\n### Tunicates (Tunicata)[edit]\n\nFurther information: Tunicata\n\nThe largest tunicate is Synoicum pulmonaria, found at depths of 20 and 40\nmetres (66 and 131 ft), and are up to 14 centimetres (6 in) in diameter. It is\nalso present in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, around the coasts of\nGreenland and Newfoundland, but is less common here than in the east, and\noccurs only at depths between 10 and 13 metres (33 and 43 ft).^[189]\n\nEntergonas (Enterogona)\n\n    The largest entergona is Synoicum pulmonaria it is usually found at depths between about 20 and 40 metres (66 and 131 ft) and can grow to over a metre (yard) in length. It is also present in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, around the coasts of Greenland and Newfoundland, but is less common here than in the east, and occurs only at depths between 10 and 13 metres (33 and 43 ft).^[189]\nPleurogonas (Pleurogona)\n\n    The largest pleurogona is Pyura pachydermatina .^[190] In colour it is off-white or a garish shade of reddish-purple. The stalk is two thirds to three quarters the length of the whole animal which helps distinguish it from certain invasive tunicates not native to New Zealand such as Styela clava and Pyura stolonifera.^[191] It is one of the largest species of tunicates and can grow to over a metre (yard) in length.^[192]\nAspiraculates (Aspiraculata)\n\n    The largest aspiraculate is Oligotrema large and surrounded by six large lobes; the cloacal syphon is small. They live exclusively in deep water and range in size from less than one inch (2 cm) to 2.4 inches (6 cm).\n\n#### Thaliacea[edit]\n\nThe Pyrosoma atlanticum is the largest thaliacean.\n\nThe largest thaliacean, Pyrosoma atlanticum, is cylindrical and can grow up to\n60 cm (2 ft) long and 4\u20136 cm wide. The constituent zooids form a rigid tube,\nwhich may be pale pink, yellowish, or bluish. One end of the tube is narrower\nand is closed, while the other is open and has a strong diaphragm. The outer\nsurface or test is gelatinised and dimpled with backward-pointing, blunt\nprocesses. The individual zooids are up to 8.5 mm (0.33 in) long and have a\nbroad, rounded branchial sac with gill slits. Along the side of the branchial\nsac runs the endostyle, which produces mucus filters. Water is moved through\nthe gill slits into the centre of the cylinder by cilia pulsating\nrhythmically. Plankton and other food particles are caught in mucus filters in\nthe processes as the colony is propelled through the water. P. atlanticum is\nbioluminescent and can generate a brilliant blue-green light when\nstimulated.^[193]^[194]\n\nDoliolida (Doliolida)\n\n    The largest doliolida is Doliolida ^[195] The doliolid body is small, typically 1\u20132 cm long, and barrel-shaped; it features two wide siphons, one at the front and the other at the back end, and eight or nine circular muscle strands reminiscent of barrel bands. Like all tunicates, they are filter feeders. They are free-floating; the same forced flow of water through their bodies with which they gather plankton is used for propulsion - not unlike a tiny ramjet engine. Doliolids are capable of quick movement. They have a complicated lifecycle consisting of sexual and asexual generations. They are nearly exclusively tropical animals, although a few species are found as far north as northern California.^[citation needed]\nSalps (Salpida)\n\n    The largest salp is Cyclosalpa bakeri 15cm (6ins) long. There are openings at the anterior and posterior ends of the cylinder which can be opened or closed as needed. The bodies have seven transverse bands of muscle interspersed by white, translucent patches. A stolon grows from near the endostyle (an elongated glandular structure producing mucus for trapping food particles). The stolon is a ribbon-like organ on which a batch of aggregate forms of the animal are produced by budding. The aggregate is the second, colonial form of the salp and is also gelatinous, transparent and flabby. It takes the shape of a radial whorl of individuals up to about 20cm (4in) in diameter. It is formed of approximately 12 zooids linked side by side in a shape that resembles a crown.^[193]^[196] are largest thetyses: Thetys vagina Individuals can reach up to 30 cm (12 in) long.^[citation needed]\nLarvaceans (Larvacea)\n\n    The largest larvacean is Appendicularia 1 cm (0.39 in) in body length (excluding the tail).^[citation needed]\n\n### Cephalochordates (Leptocardii)[edit]\n\nFurther information: Leptocardii\n\nThe largest lancelet is the European lancelet (Branchiostoma lanceolatum)\n\"primitive fish\". It can grow up to 6 cm (2.5 in) long.^[197]\n\n## Invertebrate non-chordates[edit]\n\n### Echinoderms (Echinodermata)[edit]\n\nAt up to 3 m (9.8 ft) long, the sea cucumber Synapta maculata is the longest\nknown echinoderm.\n\nThe largest species of echinoderm in terms of bulk is probably the starfish\nspecies Thromidia gigas, of the class Asteroidea, which reaches a weight of\nover 6 kg (13 lb),^[198] but it might be beaten by some giant sea cucumbers\nsuch as Thelenota anax. However, at a maximum span of 63 cm (25 in), Thromidia\ngigas is quite a bit shorter than some other echinoderms.^[1] The longest\nechinoderm known is the conspicuous sea cucumber Synapta maculata, with a\nslender body that can extend up to 3 m (9.8 ft). In comparison, the biggest\nsea star is the brisingid sea star Midgardia xandaros, reaching a span of 1.4\nm (4.6 ft), despite being quite slender.^[1] Evasterias echinosoma is another\ngiant echinoderm and can measure up to 1 m (3.3 ft) across and weigh 5.1 kg\n(11 lb).^[1]\n\nCrinoids (Crinoidea)\n\n    The largest species of crinoid is the unstalked feather-star Heliometra glacialis, reaching a total width of 78 cm (31 in) and an individual arm length of 35 cm (14 in). A width of 91.4 cm (36.0 in) was claimed for one unstalked feather-star but is not confirmed.^[1] The genus Metacrinus has a stalk span of 61 cm (24 in) but, due to its bulk and multiple arms, it is heavier than Heliometra.^[1] In the past, crinoids grew much larger, and stalk lengths up to 40 m (130 ft) have been found in the fossil record.^[199]\nSea urchins and allies (Echinoidea)\n\n    The largest sea urchin is the species Sperosoma giganteum from the deep northwest Pacific Ocean, which can reach a shell width of about 30 cm (12 in).^[200] Another deep sea species Hygrosoma hoplacantha is only slightly smaller.^[200] The largest species found along the North America coast is the Pacific red sea urchin (Mesocentrotus franciscanus) where the shell can reach 19 cm (7.5 in).^[201] If the spines enter into count, the biggest species may be a Diadematidae like Diadema setosum, with a test up to 10 cm (3.9 in) only, but its spines can reach up to 30 cm (12 in) in length.^[202]\nSea cucumbers (Holothuroidea)\n\n    The bulkiest species of sea cucumber are Stichopus variegatus and Thelenota anax, weighing several pounds, being about 21 cm (8.3 in) in diameter, and reaching a length of 1 m (3.3 ft) when fully extended. Synapta maculata can reach an extended length of 3 m (9.8 ft), but is extremely slender (3-5cm) and weigh much less than Stichopodids.^[1]\nBrittle stars (Ophiuroidea)\n\n    The largest known specimen of brittle star is the basket star Astrotoma agassizii. This species can grow to have a span of 1 m (3.3 ft).^[1] Sometimes, Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni is considered the largest but the maximum this species is can measure 70 cm (28 in) and a disk diameter of about 14.3 cm (5.6 in). Outside from euryalids, the biggest ophiurid brittle star may be Ophiopsammus maculata (6\u20137 inches).^[203]\nSea stars (Asteroidea)\n\n    The heaviest sea star is Thromidia gigas from the Indo-Pacific, which can surpass 6 kg (13 lb) in weight, but only has a diameter of about 65 cm (2.13 ft).^[198]^[200] Despite its relatively small disk and weight, the long slender arms of Midgardia xandaros from the Gulf of California makes it the sea star with the largest diameter at about 1.4 m (4.5 ft).^[200] Mithrodia clavigera may also become wider than 1 m (39 in) in some cases, with stout arms.^[citation needed]\n\n### Flatworms (Platyhelminthes)[edit]\n\nFurther information: Platyhelminthes\n\nMonogenean flatworms (Monogenea)\n\n    The largest known members of this group of very small parasites are among the genus of capsalids, Listrocephalos, reaching a length of 2 cm (0.79 in).^[204]\nFlukes (Trematoda)\n\n    The largest known species of fluke is Fasciolopsis buski, which most often attacks humans and livestock. One of these flukes can be up to 7.5 cm (3.0 in) long and 2 cm (0.79 in) thick.^[205]\nTapeworms (Cestoda)\n\n    The largest known species of tapeworm is the whale tapeworm, Polygonoporus giganticus, which can grow to over 30 m (98 ft).^[206]^[207]\n\n### Segmented worms (Annelida)[edit]\n\nThe largest of the segmented worms (including earthworms, leeches, and\npolychaetes) is the African giant earthworm (Microchaetus rappi). Although it\naverages about 1.36 m (4.5 ft) in length, this huge worm can reach a length of\nas much as 6.7 m (22 ft) and can weigh over 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).^[208] Only the\ngiant Gippsland earthworm, Megascolides australis, and a few giant\npolychaetes, including the notorious Eunice aphroditois, reach nearly\ncomparable sizes, reaching 4 and 3.6 m (13 and 12 ft), respectively.^[1]\n\n### Ribbon worms (Nemertea)[edit]\n\nThe largest nemertean is the bootlace worm, Lineus longissimus. A specimen\nfound washed ashore on a beach in St. Andrews, Scotland in 1864 was recorded\nat a length of 55 m (180 ft).^[209]\n\n### Mollusks (Mollusca)[edit]\n\nA 7 m (23 ft) giant squid, the second largest of all invertebrates, encased in\nice in the Melbourne Aquarium.\n\nBoth the largest mollusks and the largest of all invertebrates (in terms of\nmass) are the largest squids. The colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni)\nis projected to be the largest invertebrate.^[210] Current estimates put its\nmaximum size at 12 to 14 m (39 to 46 ft) long and 750 kg (1,650 lb),^[211]\nbased on analysis of smaller specimens. In 2007, authorities in New Zealand\nannounced the capture of the largest known colossal squid specimen. It was\ninitially thought to be 10 m (33 ft) and 450 kg (990 lb). It was later\nmeasured at 4.2 m (14 ft) long and 495 kg (1,091 lb) in weight. The mantle was\n2.5 m (8.2 ft) long when measured.^[212]^[213]\n\nThe giant squid (Architeuthis dux) was previously thought to be the largest\nsquid, and while it is less massive and has a smaller mantle than the colossal\nsquid, it may exceed the colossal squid in overall length including tentacles.\nOne giant squid specimen that washed ashore in 1878 in Newfoundland reportedly\nmeasured 16.8 m (55 ft) in total length (from the tip of the mantle to the end\nof the long tentacles), head and body length 6.1 m (20 ft), 4.6 m (15 ft) in\ncircumference at the thickest part of mantle, and weighed about 900 kg (2,000\nlb). This specimen is still often cited as the largest invertebrate that has\never been examined.^[1]^[214]^[215] However, no animals approaching this size\nhave been scientifically documented and, according to giant squid expert Steve\nO'Shea, such lengths were likely achieved by greatly stretching the two\ntentacles like elastic bands.^[216]\n\nAplacophorans (Aplacophora)\n\n    The largest known of these worm-like, shell-less mollusks are represented in the genus Epimenia, which can reach 30 cm (12 in) long. Most aplacophorans are less than 5 cm (2.0 in) long.^[217]\nChitons (Polyplacophora)\n\n    The largest of the chitons is the gumboot chiton, Cryptochiton stelleri, which can reach a length of 33 cm (13 in) and weigh over 2 kg (4.4 lb).^[218]\nThe mouth of a mostly hidden giant clam, the largest bivalve\n\nBivalves (Bivalvia)\n\n    The largest of the bivalve mollusks is the giant clam, Tridacna gigas. Although even larger sizes have been reported for this passive animal, the top verified size was for a specimen from the Great Barrier Reef. This creature weighed 270 kg (600 lb), had an axial length of 1.14 m (3.7 ft) and depth of 0.75 m (2.5 ft).^[1] The largest bivalve ever was Platyceramus platinus, a Cretaceous giant that reached an axial length of up to 3 m (nearly 10 ft).^[219]\nGastropods (Gastropoda)\n\n    The \"largest\" of this most diverse and successful mollusk class of slugs and snails can be defined in various ways.\n    The living gastropod species that has the largest (longest) shell is Syrinx aruanus with a maximum shell length of 0.91 m (3.0 ft), a weight of 18 kg (40 lb) and a width of 96 cm (38 in).^[220]^[221] Another giant species is Melo amphora, which in a 1974 specimen from Western Australia, measured 0.71 m (2.3 ft) long, had a maximum girth of 0.97 m (3.2 ft) and weighed 16 kg (35 lb).^[1]\n    The largest shell-less gastropod is the giant black sea hare (Aplysia vaccaria) at 0.99 m (3.2 ft) in length and almost 14 kg (31 lb) in weight.\n    The largest of the land snails is the giant African snail (Achatina achatina) at up to 1 kg (2.2 lb) and 35 cm (14 in) long.\nCephalopods (Cephalopoda)\n\n    (See Cephalopod size.) While generally much smaller than the giant Architeuthis and Mesonychoteuthis, the largest of the octopuses, the giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini), can grow to be very large. The largest confirmed weight of a giant octopus is 74 kg (163 lb),^[222] with a 7 m (23 ft) arm span (with the tentacles fully extended) and a head-to-tentacle-tip length of 3.9 m (13 ft).^[223] Specimens have been reported up to 125 kg (276 lb) but are unverified. A weight of 10 - 50kg is a much more common size.^[1]\n\n### Roundworms (Nematoda)[edit]\n\nPlacentonema gigantissima, the largest roundworm\n\nThe largest roundworm, Placentonema gigantissima,^[224] is a parasite found in\nthe placentas of sperm whales which can reach up to 9 m (30 ft) in\nlength.^[225]\n\n### Velvet worms (Onychophora)[edit]\n\nThe largest velvet worm known is Sol\u00f3rzano's velvet worm (Peripatus\nsolorzanoi). An adult female was recorded to have a body length of 22 cm\n(approximately 8.7 in).^[226]\n\n### Arthropods (Arthropoda)[edit]\n\nJapanese spider crab.\n\nThe largest arthropod known to have existed is the eurypterid (sea scorpion)\nJaekelopterus, reaching up to 2.5 m (8.2 ft) in body length, followed by the\nmillipede relative Arthropleura at around 2.1 m (6.9 ft) in length.^[227]\nAmong living arthropods, the Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi) is\nthe largest in overall size, the record specimen, caught in 1921, had an\nextended arm span of 3.8 m (12 ft) and weighed about 19 kg (42 lb).^[1] The\nheaviest is the American lobster (Homarus americanus), the largest verified\nspecimen, caught in 1977 off of Nova Scotia weighed 20 kg (44 lb) and its body\nlength was 1.1 m (3.6 ft).^[1] The largest land arthropod and the largest land\ninvertebrate is the coconut crab (Birgus latro), up to 40 cm (1.3 ft) long and\nweighing up to 4 kg (8.8 lb) on average. Its legs may span 1 m (3.3 ft).^[1]\n\n#### Arachnids (Arachnida)[edit]\n\nBoth spiders and scorpions include contenders for the largest arachnids.\n\nGiant huntsman spider\n\nSpiders (Araneae)\n\n    The largest species of arachnid by length is probably the giant huntsman spider (Heteropoda maxima) of Laos, which in 2008 replaced the Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) of northern South America as the largest known spider by leg-span.^[228] However the most massive arachnids, of comparable dimensions and possibly even greater mass, are the Chaco golden knee (Grammostola pulchripes), and the Brazilian salmon pink (Lasiodora parahybana). The huntsman spider may span up to 29 cm (11 in) across the legs, while in the New World tarantulas like Theraphosa can range up to 26 cm (10 in).^[1] In Grammostola, Theraphosa and Lasiodora, the weight is projected to be up to at least 150 g (5.3 oz) and body length is up to 10 cm (3.9 in).^[229]\nScorpions (Scorpiones)\n\n    The largest of the scorpions is the species Heterometrus swammerdami of the Indian subcontinent, which have a maximum length of 29.2 cm (11.5 in) and weigh around 60 g (2.1 oz). Another extremely large scorpion is the African emperor scorpion (Pandinus imperator), which can weigh 57 g (2.0 oz) but is not known to exceed a length of 23 cm (9.1 in).^[1] However, they were dwarfed by Pulmonoscorpius kirktonensis, a giant extinct species of scorpion from Scotland, at an estimated length of 0.7 m (2.3 ft),^[230] and the aquatic Brontoscorpio, at up to 94 cm (3.08 ft) which is only known from a free finger.^[231]\nPseudoscorpions (Pseudoscorpiones)\n\n    The largest pseudoscorpion is Garypus titanius, from Ascension island, which can be 12 mm (0.47 in) long.^[232]\n\n#### Crustaceans (Crustacea)[edit]\n\nThe largest crustacean is the Tasmanian giant crab (Pseudocarcinus gigas),\nwith a weight of 13 kilograms (29 lb) and a carapace width of up to 46\ncentimetres (18 in). It is the only species in the genus Pseudocarcinus.^[233]\nMales reach more than twice the size of females.^[234] At a length of up to 40\ncentimetres (16 in), Lysiosquillina maculata is the largest mantis shrimp in\nthe world.^[235] Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (Astacopsis gouldi) 5\nkilograms (11 lb) in weight and over 80 centimetres (31 in) long have been\nknown in the past, but now, even individuals over 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) are\nrare.^[236] The species is only found in Tasmanian rivers flowing north into\nthe Bass Strait below 400 metres (1,300 ft) above sea level, and is listed as\nan endangered species on the IUCN Red List.^[237]\n\nBranchiopods (Branchiopoda)\n\n    The largest of these primarily freshwater crustaceans is probably Branchinecta gigas, which can reach a length 10 cm (3.9 in).^[238]\nBarnacles and allies (Maxillopoda)\n\n    The largest species is Pennella balaenopterae, a copepod and ectoparasite specialising in parasitising marine mammals. The maximum size attained is 32 cm (about 13 in).^[239] The largest of the barnacles is the giant acorn barnacle, Balanus nubilis, reaching 7 cm (2.8 in) in diameter and 12.7 cm (5.0 in) high.^[240]\nOstracods (Ostracoda)\n\n    The largest living representative of these small and little-known but numerous crustaceans is the species Gigantocypris australis females of which reaching a maximum length of 3 cm (1.2 in).\n\nAmphipods, isopods, and allies (Peracarida)\n\nGiant isopod\n\n    The largest species is the giant isopod (Bathynomus pergiganteus), which can reach a length of 45 cm (18 inches) and a weight of 1.7 kg (3.7 lb).^[241]\nRemipedes (Remipedia)\n\n    The largest of these cave-dwelling crustaceans is the species Godzillius robustus, at up to 4.5 cm (1.8 in).^[242]\n\n#### Horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura)[edit]\n\nThe four modern horseshoe crabs are of roughly the same sizes, with females\nmeasuring up to 60 cm (2.0 ft) in length and 5 kg (11 lb) in weight.^[243]\n\n#### Sea spiders (Pycnogonida)[edit]\n\nThe largest of the sea spiders is the deep-sea species Colossendeis colossea,\nattaining a leg span of nearly 60 cm (2.0 ft).^[244]\n\n#### Trilobites (Trilobita)[edit]\n\nSome of these extinct marine arthropods exceeded 60 cm (24 in) in length. A\nnearly complete specimen of Isotelus rex from Manitoba attained a length over\n70 cm (28 in), and an Ogyginus forteyi from Portugal was almost as long.\nFragments of trilobites suggest even larger record sizes. An isolated pygidium\nof Hungioides bohemicus implies that the full animal was 90 cm (35 in)\nlong.^[245]^[246]\n\n#### Myriapods (Myriapoda)[edit]\n\nCentipedes (Chilopoda)\n\nScolopendra gigantea\n\n    The biggest of the centipedes is Scolopendra gigantea of the neotropics, reaching a length of 33 cm (13 in).^[247]\nMillipedes (Diplopoda)\n\n    Two species of millipede both reach a very large size: Archispirostreptus gigas of East Africa and Scaphistostreptus seychellarum, endemic to the Seychelles islands. Both of these species can slightly exceed a length of 28 cm (11 in) and measure over 2 cm (0.79 in) in diameter.^[1] The largest ever known was the Arthropleura, a gigantic prehistoric specimen that reached nearly 189 cm (74 in).\nSymphylans (Symphyla)\n\n    The largest known symphylan is Hanseniella magna, originating in Tasmanian caves, which can reach lengths from 25 mm (0.98 in) up to 30 mm (1.2 in).^[248]\n\n#### Insects (Insecta)[edit]\n\nGoliath beetle\n\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of\norganisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many\nundescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of\nbeetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms.\nAlthough heavyweight giant wetas (Deinacrida heteracantha) are known, the\nelephant beetles of Central and South America, (Megasoma elephas) and (M.\nactaeon), the Titan beetle (Titanus giganteus) of the neotropical rainforest\nor the Goliath beetles, (Goliathus goliatus) and (G. regius), of Africa's\nrainforest are thought to reach a higher weight.^[249] The most frequently\ncrowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100 g\n(3.5 oz) and 11.5 cm (4.5 in).^[1] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can\nreach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2 cm (5.2 and 6.0\nin), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. The\nGoliath beetle's wingspan can range up to 25 cm (9.8 in).^[1]\n\nSome moths and butterflies have much larger areas than the heaviest beetles,\nbut weigh a fraction as much.\n\nThe longest insects are the stick insects, see below.\n\nRepresentatives of the extinct dragonfly-like order Meganisoptera, such as the\nCarboniferous Meganeura monyi of what is now France and the Permian\nMeganeuropsis permiana of what is now North America, are the largest insect\nspecies known to have existed. These creatures had a wingspan of some 75 cm\n(30 in) and a mass of over 1 pound (450 g), making them about the size of a\ncrow.^[1]\n\nCockroaches and termites (Blattodea)\n\nGiant burrowing cockroach\n\n    The largest cockroach by body mass is the Australian giant burrowing cockroach (Macropanesthia rhinoceros), also known as the rhinoceros cockroach. This species can attain a length of 8.3 cm (3.3 in) and a weight of 36 g (1.3 oz). It does not have wings.^[250] The Brazilian giant cockroach (Blaberus giganteus) of the neotropics reaches greater sizes of up to 10 cm in length and 15 cm in wingspan, although it is not as massive and heavy as the burrowing species. The termites, traditionally classified in their own order (Isoptera), have recently been re-considered to belong in Blattodea. The largest of the termites is the African species Macrotermes bellicosus. The queen of this species can attain a length of 14 cm (5.5 in) and breadth of 5.5 cm (2.2 in) across the abdomen; other adults, on the other hand, are about a third of the size.^[1]\nBeetles (Coleoptera)\n\n    The beetles are the largest order of organisms on earth, with about 400,000 species so far identified. The most massive species are the Goliathus, Megasoma and Titanus beetles already mentioned. Another fairly large species is the Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules) of the neotropic rainforest with a maximum overall length of at least 19 cm (7.5 in) including the extremely long pronotal horn. The weight in this species does not exceed 16.5 g (0.58 oz).^[1] The longest overall beetle is a species of longhorn beetle, Batocera wallacei, from New Guinea, which can attain a length of 26.6 cm (10.5 in), about 19 cm (7.5 in) of which is comprised by the long antennae.^[1]\nEarwigs (Dermaptera)\n\n    Since 1798, the largest of the earwigs has been the Saint Helena giant earwig (Labidura herculeana), endemic to the island of its name, measuring up to 8 cm (3.1 in) in length.^[251] As of 2014, with the declaring of the organism extinct by the IUCN,^[252] this may no longer be the case, although some believe a small number individuals are still extant.^[253]\nTrue flies (Diptera)\n\nGauromydas heros, the largest fly\n\n    The largest species of this order, which includes the common housefly, is the neotropical species Gauromydas heros, which can reach a length of 6 cm (2+3\u20448 in) and a wingspan of 10 cm (3.9 in).^[1] Species of crane fly, the largest of which is Holorusia brobdignagius, can attain a length of 23 cm (9.1 in) but are extremely slender and much lighter in weight than Gauromydas.\nMayflies (Ephemeroptera)\n\n    The largest mayflies are members of the genus Proboscidoplocia from Madagascar. These insects can reach a length of 7 cm (2.8 in).^[254]\nTrue bugs (Hemiptera)\n\nGiant water bug walking over land\n\n    \n\nThe largest species of this diverse order is usually listed as the giant water\nbug in the genus Lethocerus, with L. maximus from the Neotropics being the\nabsolutely largest.^[255] They can surpass 12 cm (4.7 in) in length,^[256]\nwith some suggesting that the maximum size is 15 cm (5.9 in).^[257] It is more\nslender and less heavy than most other insects of this size (principally the\nhuge beetles). The largest cicada is Megapomponia imperatoria, which has a\nhead-body length of about 7 cm (2.8 in) and a wingspan of 18\u201320 cm (7\u20138\nin).^[258]^[259] The cicadas of the genus Tacua can also grow to comparably\nlarge sizes. The largest type of aphid is the giant oak aphid (Stomaphis\nquercus), which can reach an overall length of 2 cm (0.79 in).^[260] The\nbiggest species of leafhopper is Ledromorpha planirostris, which can reach a\nlength of 2.8 cm (1.1 in).^[261]\n\nMegachile pluto, the largest bee.\n\nAnts and allies (Hymenoptera)\n\n    The largest of the ants, and the heaviest species of the order, are the females of the African Dorylus helvolus, reaching a length of 5.1 cm (2.0 in) and a weight of 8.5 g (0.30 oz).^[1] The ant that averages the largest for the mean size within the whole colony is a ponerine ant, Dinoponera gigantea, from South America, averaging up to 3.3 cm (1.3 in) from the mandibles to the end of abdomen.^[1] Workers of the bulldog ant (Myrmecia brevinoda) of Australia are up to 3.7 cm (1.5 in) in total length, although much of this is from their extremely large mandibles.^[1] The largest of the bee species, also in the order Hymenoptera, is Megachile pluto of Indonesia, the females of which can be 3.8 cm (1.5 in) long, with a 6.3 cm (2.5 in) wingspan. Nearly as large, the carpenter bees can range up to 2.53 cm (1.00 in).^[1] The largest wasp is probably the so-called tarantula hawk species Pepsis pulszkyi of South America, at up to 6.8 cm (2.7 in) long and 11.6 cm (4.6 in) wingspan, although many other Pepsis approach a similar size. The giant scarab-hunting wasp Megascolia procer may rival the largest tarantula hawks in weight and wingspan, though its body is not as long.^[1]\n\nMoths and allies (Lepidoptera)\n\nQueen Alexandra's birdwing.\n\n    The Hercules moth (Coscinocera hercules), in the family Saturniidae, is endemic to New Guinea and northern Australia, and its wings have the largest documented surface area (300 square centimeters) of any living insect,^[262]^[263] and a maximum wingspan which is confirmed to 28 cm (11 in) while unconfirmed specimens have spanned up to 35.5 cm (14.0 in). The largest species overall is often claimed to be either the Queen Alexandra's birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae), a butterfly from Papua New Guinea, or the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas), a moth from Southeast Asia. Both of these species can reach a length of 8 cm (3.1 in), a wingspan of 28 cm (11 in) and a weight of 12 g (0.42 oz). One Atlas moth allegedly had a wingspan of 30 cm (12 in) but this measurement was not verified.^[1] The larvae in the previous species can weigh up to 58 and 54 g (2.0 and 1.9 oz), respectively. However, there are no reported measurements of surface area that would exceed the Hercules moth, and the white witch (Thysania agrippina) of Central and South America, has the largest recorded wingspan of the order, and indeed of any living insect, though the white witch is exceeded in surface area by the Hercules moth. The verified record-sized Thysania spanned 30.8 cm (12.1 in) across the wings, although specimens have been reported to 36 cm (14 in).^[1] The heaviest mature moths have been cited in the giant carpenter moth (Xyleutes boisduvali) of Australia, which has weighed up to 20 g (0.71 oz) although the species does not surpass 25.5 cm (10.0 in) in wingspan.^[1]\nMantises (Mantodea)\n\n    The largest species of this order is Toxodera denticulata from Java, which has been measured up to 20 cm (7.9 in) in overall length.^[264] However, an undescribed species from the Cameroon jungle is allegedly much larger than any other mantis and may rival the larger stick insects for the longest living insect.^[265] Among widespread mantis species, the largest is the Chinese mantis (Tenodera aridifolia). The females of this species can attain a length of up to 10.6 cm (4.2 in).\nScorpionflies (Mecoptera)\n\n    The largest scorpionfly, the common scorpionfly (Panorpa communis), can reach a body length of about 30 millimetres (1.2 in).^[266]\nAlderflies and allies (Megaloptera)\n\n    This relatively small insect order includes some rather large species, many of which are noticeable for their elongated, imposing mandibles. The dobsonflies reach the greatest sizes of the order and can range up to 12.5 cm (4.9 in) in length.^[267]\nNet-winged insects (Neuroptera)\n\nBlue eyes lacewing\n\n    These flying insects reach their largest size in Palparellus voeltzkowi, which can have a wingspan over 16 cm (6.3 in).^[268] The largest lacewing is the \"blue eyes lacewing\" (Nymphes myrmeleonides) of Australia, which can measure up to 4 cm (1.6 in) in length and span 11 cm (4.3 in) across the wings.^[269] Some forms of this ancient order could grow extremely large during the Jurassic period and may have ranked among the largest insects ever.^[270] Found in the Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, Makarkinia adamsi had wings nearly 140\u2013160 mm (5.5\u20136.3 in) in length.^[271]\nDragonflies and damselflies (Odonata)\n\n    The largest species of Odonata is the damselfly Megaloprepus caerulatus of the neotropics, attaining a size of as much as 19 cm (7.5 in) across the wings and a body length of over 12 cm (4.7 in).^[1] The largest species of dragonfly is Tetracanthagyna plagiata of Southeast Asia, spanning up to 17.6 cm (6.9 in) and measuring up to 11.8 cm (4.6 in) long; while bulkier and heavier than Megaloprepus (at up to 7 g (0.25 oz)), it is smaller in its linear dimensions.^[1]\nGrasshoppers and allies (Orthoptera)\n\nGiant weta\n\n    The largest of this widespread, varied complex of insects are the giant wetas of New Zealand, which is now split among 12 species. The largest of these is the Little Barrier Island giant weta (Deinacrida heteracantha), the largest specimen was weighed at 71.3 g (2.52 oz), one of the largest insects weights ever known. These heavyweight insects can be over 9 cm (3.5 in) long.^[1] The largest grasshopper species is often considered to be the Australian giant grasshopper (Valanga irregularis), which ranges up to 9 cm (3.5 in) in length.^[272] The American eastern lubber grasshopper (Romalea guttata) can allegedly range up to 10 cm (3.9 in) in length.^[273] However, the greatest grasshopper sizes known, to 12 cm (4.7 in), have been cited in the South American giant grasshopper (Tropidacris violaceus). The longest members of this order (although much lighter than the giant wetas) is the katydid Macrolyristes corporalis of Southeast Asia which can range up to 21.5 cm (8.5 in) with its long legs extended and can have a wingspan of 20 cm (7.9 in).^[274]\nStick insects (Phasmatodea)\n\n    The longest known stick insects are also the longest known insects, notably species in the tribe Pharnaciini, but they are generally relatively lightweight because of their slender shape. The longest is an unnamed species of Phryganistria discovered in China in 2016, where a specimen held at the Insect Museum of West China in Chengdu has a total length of 62.4 cm (24.6 in).^[275] The second-longest species is the Australian Ctenomorpha gargantua, females of which have been measured at over 60 cm (24 in) in total length.^[276] Other very large species, formerly believed to be longest but now considered third longest is Sadyattes chani; a specimen held in the Natural History Museum in London has a total length of 56.7 cm (22.3 in).^[277]^[278] These measurements are, however, with the front legs fully extended; it has a body length measuring 35.7 cm (14.1 in).^[279] Another very large species is Phobaeticus kirbyi where the total length (including extended legs) is up to 54.6 cm (21.5 in) and the body alone up to 32.8 cm (12.9 in).^[280] Another of the longest insect in terms of total length is Phobaeticus serratipes of Malaysia and Singapore, measuring up to 55.5 cm (21.9 in).^[281] Another extremely long stick insect is Pharnacia maxima, which measured 51 cm (20 in) with its legs extended.^[1] The spiny stick insect (Heteropteryx dilatata) of Malaysia does not reach the extreme lengths of its cousins, the body reaching up to 16 cm (6.3 in) long, but it is much bulkier. The largest Heteropteryx weighed about 65 g (2.3 oz) and was 3.5 cm (1.4 in) wide across the thickest part of the body.^[1]\nLice (Phthiraptera)\n\n    These insects, which live parasitically on other animals, are as a rule quite small. The largest known species is the hog louse, Haematopinus suis, a sucking louse that lives on large livestock like pigs and cattle. It can range up to 6 mm (0.24 in) in length.^[282]\n\nStoneflies (Plecoptera)\n\nPteronarcys californica\n\n    The largest species of stonefly is Pteronarcys californica of western North America, a species favored by fishermen as lures. This species can attain a length of 5 cm (2.0 in) and a wingspan of over 9.5 cm (3.7 in).^[283]\nBooklice (Psocoptera)\n\n    The largest of this order of very small insects are the barklice of the genus Psocus, the top size of which is about 1 cm.^[284]\nFleas (Siphonaptera)\n\n    The largest species of flea is Hystrichopsylla schefferi. This parasite is known exclusively from the fur of the mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa) and can reach a length of 1.2 cm (0.47 in).^[1]\nSilverfishes and allies (Thysanura)\n\n    These ancient flightless insects, some of which feed on human household objects, can range up to 4.3 cm (1.7 in) in length. A 350 million year old form was known to grow quite large, at up to 6 cm (2.4 in).^[citation needed]\n\nThrips (Thysanoptera)\n\n    Members of the genus Phasmothrips are the largest kinds of thrips. The maximum size these species attain is approximately 1.3 cm (0.51 in) in length.^[285]\nCaddisflies (Trichoptera)\n\n    The largest of the small, moth-like caddisflies is Eubasilissa maclachlani. This species can range up to 7 cm (2.8 in) across the wings.^[286]\nAngel insects (Zoraptera)\n\n    The largest angel insect species, Hubbard's angel insect (Zorotypus hubbardi), grows up to 3 mm (0.12 in) in length.^[287]^[288]\n\n### Cnidarians (Cnidaria)[edit]\n\nThe lion's mane jellyfish, one of the longest extant animals\n\nThe lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) is the largest cnidarian species,\nof the class Scyphozoa. The largest known specimen of this giant, found washed\nup on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870,^[289]^[290] had a bell diameter\nof 2.5 m (8.2 ft), a weight of 150 kg (330 lb). The tentacles of this\nspecimens were as long as 37 m (121 ft) and were projected to have a\ntentacular spread of about 75 m (246 ft) making it one of the longest extant\nanimals.^[1]\n\nCorals and sea anemones (Anthozoa)\n\n    The largest individual species are the sea-anemones of the genus Discoma, which can attain a mouth disc diameter of 60 cm (2.0 ft).^[291] Longer, but much less massive overall, are the anemones of the genus Ceriantharia, at up to 2 m (6.6 ft) tall.^[292] Communities of coral can be truly massive, a single colony of the genus Porites can be over 10 m (33 ft), but the actual individual organisms are quite small.\nHydrozoans (Hydrozoa)\n\n    The colonial siphonophore Praya dubia can attain lengths of 40\u201350 m (130\u2013160 ft).^[293] The Portuguese man o' war's (Physalia physalis) tentacles can attain a length of up to 50 m (160 ft).^[294] On 6 April 2020 the Schmidt Ocean Institute announced the discovery of a giant Apolemia siphonophore in submarine canyons near Ningaloo Coast, measuring 15 m (49 ft) diameter with a ring approximately 47 m (154 ft) long, claiming it was possibly the largest siphonophore ever recorded.^[295]^[296]\n\n### Sponges (Porifera)[edit]\n\nDespite its inert appearance, the heavyweight Xestospongia muta is indeed an\nanimal\n\nThe largest known species of sea sponge is the giant barrel sponge,\nXestospongia muta. These massively built sponges can reach 2.4 m (8 ft) in\nheight and can be about the same thickness at the thickest part of the\n\"body\".^[297] Some of these creatures have been estimated to be over 2,400\nyears of age.^[298]\n\nCalcareous sponges (Calcarea)\n\n    The largest known of these small, inconspicuous sponges is probably the species Pericharax heteroraphis, attaining a height of 30 cm (0.98 ft). Most calcareous sponges do not exceed 10 cm (3.9 in) tall.^[citation needed]\nHexactinellid sponges (Hexactinellida)\n\n    A relatively common species, Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni, can reach a height of 1 m (3.3 ft) once they are of a very old age.^[299] This is the maximum size recorded for a hexactinellid sponge.^[citation needed]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Largest prehistoric animals\n  * Megafauna\n  * Largest organisms\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i ^j ^k ^l ^m ^n ^o ^p ^q ^r ^s ^t ^u ^v ^w ^x ^y ^z ^aa ^ab ^ac ^ad ^ae ^af ^ag ^ah ^ai ^aj ^ak ^al ^am ^an ^ao ^ap ^aq ^ar ^as ^at ^au ^av ^aw ^ax ^ay ^az ^ba ^bb ^bc ^bd ^be ^bf ^bg ^bh ^bi ^bj Wood, Gerald The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats (1983) ISBN 978-0-85112-235-9\n  2. ^ Davies, Ella (20 April 2016). \"The longest animal alive may be one you never thought of\".
