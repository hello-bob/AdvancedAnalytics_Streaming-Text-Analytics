Sign up for it here.\n\nOver the past decade, sleep has become better understood as a core part of\nwellness. But the stressors of modern life mean that Americans are getting\nless of it.\n\nFirst, here are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\n  * The Supreme Court goes through the looking glass on presidential immunity.\n  * The inflation plateau\n  * The campus-left occupation that broke higher education\n\nSleep No More\n\nIn the 1980s, when Rafael Pelayo was a young medical student setting out in\nthe field of sleep research, people thought he was wasting his time. At that\npoint, our culture was not so obsessed with the subject of rest. Now, he told\nme, people acknowledge that he was onto something\u2014and insomniacs circle him\n\u201clike sharks to blood\u201d when they hear what he does for a living. Pelayo, a\nclinical professor at the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center, says that the \u201ctide\nis changing\u201d in how society values sleep. Over the past decade, how, and how\nmuch, we sleep has become a major health and wellness concern.\n\nIt\u2019s a subject on Americans\u2019 minds: Late last year, for the first time since\nGallup began asking the question in 2001, a majority of surveyed American\nadults said they would feel better if they slept more; 57 percent of people\nsurveyed said that they need to get more sleep, up from 43 percent in 2013,\nwhen the data were last gathered.\n\nPeople\u2019s self-reported quantities of sleep are also on the decline. Compared\nwith a decade ago, fewer people report getting eight hours or more of sleep,\nand more people say they get five hours or less. Just 36 percent of women\nreport getting the sleep they need\u2014down from more than half in 2013.\n\nAs anyone who has lain awake at night knows, anxiety can affect sleep. That\nAmericans say they are not sleeping as well as they reported in 2013 likely\ncan be blamed in part on the stresses of the pandemic, Brynn K. Dredla, a\nneurologist and sleep-medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville,\nFlorida, told me. \u201cFrom a survival standpoint, if we\u2019re under stress, our body\nthinks, Well, I have to be awake to deal with that stress,\u201d she explained. Our\nbrains have trouble distinguishing between acute danger, such as a bear\nattack, and chronic stress. \u201cFor us to sleep, we need to have a physically and\npsychologically safe environment,\u201d she said. (A cold, dark, quiet room\u2014with\nInstagram and news apps far away from the bed and the mind\u2014doesn\u2019t hurt\neither.)\n\nTeenagers aren\u2019t sleeping enough, and they\u2019re experiencing high levels of\nstress\u2014particularly teen girls. Blaming the ubiquity of the smartphone for bad\nsleep would be easy, but Pelayo finds that too simplistic\u2014after all, we \u201chad\nsleep issues way before the phones came out,\u201d he noted. Teens aren\u2019t getting\nenough sleep, Pelayo argued, in part because school tends to start at such an\nungodly hour (he has advocated for later start times, a legislative effort\nthat has gained momentum in states including California and Florida). It\ndoesn\u2019t help that adolescents are generally not great at recognizing when they\nare sleepy. Teens need a lot of sleep, Dredla explained, and sleep deprivation\noften makes them frustrated, which in turn \u201cwill lead to behaviors that\nactually can start promoting wakefulness,\u201d such as napping or drinking\ncaffeine. It\u2019s not just teens\u2014anyone can build up \u201csleep debt\u201d and get into a\ncycle of sleeping poorly, stimulating themselves to stay awake, having trouble\nsleeping at night, and doing it all over again.\n\nAs sleep has become more central to Americans\u2019 conception of wellness,\ncompanies have swooped in to try to package sleep as a luxury good. A cottage\nindustry of products, including specialized pillows, apps, and pills, has\nsprung up in recent years promising to help people sleep better. Some simple\npieces of technology\u2014better mattresses, better cooling systems\u2014have indeed\nenhanced sleep over the decades. But you don\u2019t necessarily need to buy more\nstuff in order to sleep better. Savvy marketing makes people think the\nsolution is complex, but at its core, the human body wants to sleep. \u201cYou were\nsleeping in utero,\u201d Pelayo reminded me.\n\nOf course, knowing this is not always enough to help a person struggling to\nget solid sleep. Pelayo advises that a good step for people having trouble\nsleeping is to wake up at the same time every morning. Forcing yourself to\nfall asleep is nearly impossible; if someone offered you $1,000 to fall asleep\nimmediately, it might get even harder. But, he said, you can make yourself\nwake up consistently.\n\nA good night of sleep consists of four factors, Pelayo explained: amount of\nsleep, quality of sleep, timing of sleep, and state of mind. That last one is\nkey, he said\u2014if you don\u2019t look forward to going to bed, or if you dread waking\nup in the morning, you may have a very hard time sleeping. People tend to\nblame themselves when they don\u2019t sleep well. He suggests that a better route\nfor such people is to try to move past \u201cthat self-blame, because it\u2019s not\nhelpful. We want to figure out what\u2019s happening.\u201d It could be that you have a\nsleep disorder; many women, for example, develop sleep apnea after menopause.\n\nOver the decades, Pelayo has watched sleep wellness become more valued, in\nparallel to many Americans beginning to internalize the benefits of eating\nhealthy foods. \u201cWaking up tired is like leaving a restaurant hungry,\u201d Pelayo\nsaid. Though many Americans seem to feel that way these days, he retains hope.\nThe good news about sleep? Everyone can do it. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun gig as a sleep\ndoctor, because most patients get better.\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\n  * The Protestant sleep ethic\n  * Can medieval sleeping habits fix America\u2019s insomnia?\n\nToday\u2019s News\n\n  1.
