The A39\nroad provides access from the towns of Barnstaple, Bideford, and Bude. It lies\nat the south end of Northam Burrows and faces westward into Bideford Bay,\nopposite Saunton Sands and Braunton Burrows. There is an electoral ward with\nthe same name. The population at the 2011 census was 2,112.^[1]\n\n## Name[edit]\n\nRoad sign marking the entrance to the village\n\nWestward Ho! is noted for its unusual place name.^[2] The village name comes\nfrom the title of Charles Kingsley's novel Westward Ho! (1855), which was set\nin nearby Bideford. The book was a bestseller, and entrepreneurs saw the\nopportunity to develop tourism in the area. The Northam Burrows Hotel and\nVilla Building Company, chaired by Isaac Newton Wallop, 5th Earl of\nPortsmouth, was formed in 1863, and its prospectus stated:\n\n> This Company has been formed for the erection of a Family Hotel, on an\n> Estate purchased for the purpose immediately contiguous to Northam Burrows,\n> and of Villas and Lodging Houses for Sale or Lease. The want of such\n> accommodation has long been felt, and as no attempt to supply it has\n> hitherto been made by individuals, it is deemed to be a legitimate project\n> to be undertaken by a Company. The salubrity and beauty of the North of\n> Devon have long been known and appreciated. Sir James Clark has placed it in\n> the highest position for health-giving qualities; and the recent publication\n> of Professor Kingsley's \"Westward Ho\" has excited increased public attention\n> to the western part, more especially, of this romantic and beautiful coast.\n> Nothing but a want of accommodation for visitors has hitherto prevented its\n> being the resort of families seeking the advantages of sea bathing, combined\n> with the invigorating breezes of the Atlantic....\n\nThe hotel was named the Westward Ho!-tel, and the adjacent villas were also\nnamed after the book. As further development took place, the expanding\nsettlement also acquired the name of Westward Ho!^[3]^[4] The exclamation mark\nis therefore an intentional part of the village's name. It is the only such\nplace name in the British Isles;^[5] Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, Quebec, Canada,\nshares the distinction of having an exclamation mark in its name.\n\n## Development[edit]\n\nHoly Trinity Church\n\nDevelopment of the village began ten years after the 1855 Kingsley novel was\npublished, in order to satisfy the Victorians' passion for seaside\nholidays.^[6] The United Services College was founded in the village in 1874.\n\nShell middens and a submerged forest that date to the Mesolithic period have\nbeen excavated on the shoreline at Westward Ho!.^[7]\n\nThe village has become more residential as holiday camps closed and houses and\nflats were erected. One former camp was Torville Camp. The two major holiday\ncamps still running are Surfbay Holiday Park and Braddick's Holiday Centre.\n\n## United Services College[edit]\n\nMain article: United Services College\n\nThe United Services College, a public school for boys aged about thirteen to\neighteen, was founded at Westward Ho! in 1874 and had the aim of preparing\nboys for the army and navy and for the service of the British Empire. It\nlasted until 1906, when it merged with the Imperial Service College in\nBerkshire and closed its site at Westward Ho!. Notable old boys included\nRudyard Kipling, whose book Stalky & Co. (1899) is based on his time at the\nCollege.\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\nThe pebble ridge at Westward Ho! beach\n\nWestward Ho! is known for its surfing seas and the long expanse of clean sand\nbacked by a pebble ridge and grasslands which extends for about three miles.\nIt has two churches, Westward Ho! Baptist Church and Holy Trinity Church.\n\nThe seaward part of the village lies within the North Devon Coast, an Area of\nOutstanding Natural Beauty.\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\nThe rocks on the coastline of Westward Ho! are of Upper Carboniferous age. The\nrocks were tilted during the Variscan Orogeny; in the present day they dip at\n50\u201370 degrees north and south. The wave-cut platform is an example of a multi-\nscale fault system, with the phases of tectonic activity exposed at low tide.\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n### Bus services[edit]\n\n  * Stagecoach 21 \u2013 The North Devon Wave \u2013 Westward Ho! \u2013 Northam \u2013 Bideford \u2013 Instow Anstey Way \u2013 Fremington \u2013 Bickington \u2013 Railway Station \u2013 Barnstaple Bus Station - Braunton - Ilfracombe^[8]\n  * Stagecoach services run right through the day at 30-minute intervals, 2 buses an hour during the summer months and hourly during the winter.\n  * Stagecoach 16 runs to Appledore \u2013 Northam \u2013 Bideford 6 times a week only on Tuesdays and Thursdays 3x per day.\n  * National Express Coaches used to serve Westward Ho!.\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\nMain article: Westward Ho! railway station\n\nA railway served Westward Ho! from 1901 to 1917. The Bideford, Westward Ho!\nand Appledore Railway was a standard gauge railway which ran between these\nplaces, but had no connection with the rest of the railway system, though\nthere was a pedestrian ferry link from Appledore to Instow which was connected\nto the rest of the rail network of Britain. A section of the trackbed is used\nas part of the South West Coast Path.\n\nThe Charles Kingsley statue in nearby Bideford\n\nThe West Country class locomotive number 21C136 (later 34036), built initially\nfor Southern Railways and later British Rail, was named \"Westward Ho!\" after\nthe town.\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\nIt is also known for the Royal North Devon Golf Club, the oldest golf course\nin England and Wales. Other attractions of the village include the arcades, a\ngo-kart track and the Rock Pool a tidal lido.\n\n## World War II[edit]\n\nAdapted Bailey bridges were tested at Westward Ho! as part of the Mulberry\nHarbour project, as well as the Panjandrum by the Directorate of Miscellaneous\nWeapons Development.^[9]\n\n## Notable resident[edit]\n\nRudyard Kipling spent several of his childhood years at Westward Ho!, where he\nattended the United Services College (later absorbed by Haileybury College,\nwhich is now in Hertfordshire). His collection of stories, Stalky & Co,\npublished in 1899, was based on his experiences at the College. To commemorate\nhis living there, the first stanza of his poem \"If\u2014\" is set into the pavement\non the promenade in granite setts.^[10]\n\nThe view inland\n\n## Twin towns[edit]\n\nWestward Ho! is twinned with Mondeville in France, and B\u00fcddenstedt in Germany.\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\nThe town lends its name to the song \"Westward Ho! - Massive Letdown\" by the\nband Half Man Half Biscuit which recounts a dream about holidaying in the\ntown. The song also mentions the nearby village of Northam.^[11]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * North Devon Coast AONB\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Ward population 2011\".
