According to previous\nresearch, the sounds of planes flying overhead can ruin sleep quality for\npeople who live near airports. Another study found that people exposed to\nairplane noise at night are more likely to suffer heart failure. So, is it\npossible for jets to one day have silent engines? This tantalizing prospect,\nbelieve it or not, is now one step closer to reality, thanks to innovative\nresearch conducted by a team of engineers at the University of Bristol in the\nUnited Kingdom.\n\nTheir findings, recently published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, shed new\nlight on the noise generated by an innovative type of aircraft engine known as\na boundary layer ingesting (BLI) ducted fan.\n\nBoundary layer ingesting (BLI) ducted fan test rig inside the aeroacoustics\nwind tunnel facility at the University of Bristol.

To put it simply, these engines are a bit\nlike the ones you\u2019d find on a typical modern airliner, but with a clever\ntwist. Instead of being mounted under the wings, they are partially embedded\ninto the main body of the aircraft. This unique configuration allows them to\n\u201cingest\u201d air not just from the front but also from the surface of the plane\nitself. As a result, the engines don\u2019t have to work as hard to propel the\naircraft forward, leading to significant fuel savings.\n\nBut while BLI ducted fans promise to revolutionize the way we fly, there\u2019s a\ncatch: noise. Until now, very little was known about how these engines\nactually generate and propagate sound, especially when they are mounted on\ncurved surfaces like the fuselage of an aircraft. This is where the Bristol\nteam, led by researcher Feroz Ahmed and Professor Mahdi Azarpeyvand, comes in.\n\nUsing the state-of-the-art facilities at the University\u2019s National\nAeroacoustic Wind Tunnel, the researchers were able to pinpoint the various\nsources of noise in a BLI ducted fan setup. They discovered that the noise\npattern changes depending on how much thrust the fan is producing. At high\nthrust levels, the noise is similar to what you\u2019d expect from a conventional,\nunducted fan. But when the fan is producing less thrust, something interesting\nhappens: the duct itself starts to contribute more to the overall noise.\n\nTo better understand these phenomena, it\u2019s helpful to think of a BLI ducted\nfan as a bit like a high-tech hairdryer. When you turn a hairdryer on full\nblast, most of the noise comes from the fan inside. But if you turn it down to\na lower setting, you might start to notice a different kind of sound, perhaps\na whistling or whooshing noise coming from the duct or nozzle. In a similar\nway, the noise from a BLI ducted fan is a complex interplay between the fan\nitself, the duct that surrounds it, and the air flowing over the curved\nsurface of the airframe.\n\nThe Bristol team\u2019s research is a crucial first step in understanding and\nultimately mitigating the noise generated by these innovative engines. By\nbreaking down the various noise sources and studying how they change under\ndifferent operating conditions, the researchers are paving the way for\nquieter, more efficient aircraft designs.\n\nComplex noise sources illustration in an embedded engine or boundary layer\ningesting (BLI) ducted fan.

Quieter planes would not only\nimprove the quality of life for these residents but also potentially allow for\nmore flights to operate during noise-sensitive hours, such as early mornings\nor late evenings. Moreover, reducing noise is a key hurdle in getting new\naircraft designs certified by regulatory agencies.\n\nThere are also exciting implications for the future of urban air mobility.\nMany companies are currently developing small, electric vertical take-off and\nlanding (eVTOL) aircraft for use as aerial taxis or personal vehicles. These\ndesigns often rely on ducted fans for propulsion, and minimizing noise will be\ncritical for their acceptance and widespread adoption in cities.\n\nThe Bristol team\u2019s work is already garnering attention from major players in\nthe aviation industry. Projects like the Bell X-22A, Embraer X, Airbus E-fan,\nLilium Jet, Green Jet, and Hybrid Air Vehicle are all exploring the use of\nembedded ducted fans for next-generation aircraft. By providing a clearer\nunderstanding of the noise challenges involved, the research could help guide\nthe design and development of these futuristic planes.\n\nAs Dr. Ahmed notes, the study\u2019s findings could also have far-reaching impacts\non the scientific community. The complex interplay of noise sources in a BLI\nducted fan setup is a fascinating problem from a fluid mechanics perspective,\nand the team\u2019s work is likely to inspire further research and exploration in\nthis field.\n\n\u201cOur study sheds light on how noise is generated by futuristic embedded ducted\nfans mounted on curved airframe surfaces, revealing that noise patterns vary\nwith fan thrust levels, offering crucial insights for quieter next-generation\naircraft design,\u201d he says in a media release.\n\nUltimately, the quest for quieter, more efficient aircraft is driven by a\ngrowing demand for air travel that is not only more environmentally friendly\nbut also more pleasant for passengers and communities on the ground. By\nunlocking the secrets of noise generation in embedded ducted fans, the\nUniversity of Bristol team has brought us one step closer to this vision of a\ngreener, quieter future for aviation. As research in this area continues to\nadvance, we can look forward to a day when the roar of jet engines is replaced\nby the gentle hum of a new generation of aircraft, whisking us to our\ndestinations with unprecedented efficiency and minimal disturbance to the\nworld below.\n\nArticle reviewed by StudyFinds Editor-in-Chief Steve Fink.\n\nTags: air travel, airplanes, engineering, noise, noise pollution, sound\n\nAdd a Comment\n\nAbout the Author\n\n### StudyFinds Editor\n\nView StudyFinds's article archive\n\nThe contents of this website do not constitute advice and are provided for\ninformational purposes only.
