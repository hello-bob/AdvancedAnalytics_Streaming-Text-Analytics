Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Fear Factory\u2019s Demanufacture: the future-metal classic that rewired the 90s\n\nBy Dom Lawson\n\n( Metal Hammer )\n\npublished 10 November 2015\n\nIn the summer of \u201995, Fear Factory unleashed Demanufacture \u2013 a futuristic\nmasterpiece that would influence metal to come\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that the future is created in the here and now.\n\nWhen Fear Factory released second album Demanufacture in 1995, it pointedly\nand powerfully predicted both metal\u2019s future and the runaway train of\ninteractive technology and artificial intelligence. More importantly, it\nchanged the way heavy music sounded forever.\n\nIn truth, Fear Factory were not the most likely candidates for widespread\nsuccess. Their 1991 debut, Soul Of A New Machine, was an extraordinarily fresh\nand inventive extreme metal record that took its cues from death metal,\ngrindcore and industrial music, with vocalist Burton C. Bell\u2019s then-\nunprecedented method of switching from guttural growl to haunting croon\nproving the element that contributed most to the band\u2019s perceived uniqueness.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 1993\u2019s similarly groundbreaking Fear Is The Mindkiller\nremix EP that Burton and guitarist Dino Cazares\u2019s musical vision would be\ntruly brought to life. Comprising new versions of songs from their debut,\ndismantled and rebuilt by Rhys Fulber of industrial heavyweights Frontline\nAssembly, the record\u2019s joyous cross-pollination set Fear Factory on the right\ntrack and towards the album that would soon define their career.\n\n\u201cFear Is The Mindkiller is what we wanted to be,\u201d Dino says today. \u201cWe just\ndidn\u2019t have the technology to do that at first. We didn\u2019t have the keyboard\nsamples or the old-school computers that guys like Rhys were using. So we\u2019d\ntry to emulate the machine with guitars, bass, drums and vocals. If you listen\nto old industrial bands like KMFDM or Ministry, they\u2019d sample a metal riff and\nthen loop it so it was the same riff over and over. Well, we were trying to\ncopy that.\u201d\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM loudersound\n\n\u201cDino was trying to find a way to turbocharge their music and soup it up a\nlittle bit,\u201d explains Rhys. \u201cFear Is The Mindkiller got the band into\nindustrial clubs where they wouldn\u2019t have been played before. When it came to\nthe next record, they asked me to bring more of that stuff into their music.\u201d\n\nInstrumental in signing Fear Factory to Roadrunner all those years ago,\nrenowned metal A&R Monte Conner (now of Nuclear Blast) plainly saw the\npotential in the band\u2019s idiosyncratic approach, and he maintains that what\nthey were doing was revolutionary.\n\n(Image credit: Burton C Bell & Fear Factory)\n\n\u201cFear Factory were pioneering from the beginning,\u201d he insists. \u201cThose vocals\nstarted on that first album \u2013 a brutal death metal band were putting in these\npoppy choruses, and how groundbreaking was that? But the goal when they were\nmaking Demanufacture was to evolve away from death metal and towards something\ncompletely new.\u201d\n\n## Metal Hammer Newsletter\n\nSign up below to get the latest from Metal Hammer, plus exclusive special\noffers, direct to your inbox!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThanks to the diverse tastes of all involved, Fear Factory were never destined\nto be another generic metal band. From death metal and industrial to\nelectronica and soundtracks, everything the band loved was coalescing into a\nnew and thrillingly unfamiliar identity. The early 90s were not the most\nauspicious time for metal in commercial terms, but alongside the likes of\nSepultura, Pantera, Machine Head and Korn, Fear Factory were throwing the\ngenre a lifeline by simply devising a new way of doing things.\n\n\u201cWe had this vision of how we wanted Fear Factory to sound and it took us a\nwhile to grasp and understand our craft, and how to get to that point,\u201d states\nBurton. \u201cAt the time of Demanufacture, everything came together. Lyrically,\nconceptually and sonically, the arrangements, the production... it all just\nclicked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t afraid of taking chances,\u201d Dino adds, \u201cbut we were really just\ndoing what we liked. Making bigger choruses or bringing in the techno\nelements, it was like, \u2018This is the shit we like, so let\u2019s do it!\u2019 We had\nnothing to lose.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Burton C Bell & Fear Factory)\n\nAs Fear Factory\u2019s music evolved, so did the band\u2019s conceptual core. Although\nhistory may tend to paint the band as sci-fi nerds, perpetually banging on\nabout man\u2019s impending battle with robots, the true inspiration behind\n*Demanufacture *and its tales of rebellion against a corrupt technologically\nadvanced elite came from the reality of life on the streets of Los Angeles in\nthe first half of the 90s.\n\n\u201cFrom 1990 to 1995, there were fires, floods and riots,\u201d Dino explains. \u201cIn\n1994 there was a big earthquake. So we saw LA being destroyed. We saw all the\nlooters, we saw people shooting each other, we saw the National Guard\npatrolling our streets at night. So we were living it. Burt was able to\nchannel all of that and put it into Demanufacture. The first line you hear on\nthe album is \u2018Desensitised by the values of life...\u2019 That was what we saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemanufacture was a concept album, but it was inspired by true events,\u201d adds\nBurton. \u201cWe were in a hostile environment. The whole time leading up to the\nriots, you could sense tension in the air, between everybody. Everyone was a\ntarget. No one trusted the police. It was surreal. There were guys on top of\nbuildings with semi-automatic rifles, protecting their goods. We were living\nin Demanufacture times, fighting against the man and struggling for survival.\u201d\n\nWith high expectations, an incendiary concept and a handsome budget from an\noptimistic Roadrunner, Fear Factory began work on Demanufacture at the\nlegendary Chicago Trax studio, chosen primarily because industrial mainstays\nlike Ministry and Skinny Puppy had recorded there.\n\n\u201cThat studio was a fucking wreck,\u201d Dino recalls with a sigh. \u201cWe started\nrecording drums, the computer kept crashing, people were selling drugs out of\nthe studio. We were like, \u2018We need to get the fuck out of here!\u2019\u201d\n\nRhys Fulber was in charge of \u201cturbocharging\u201d the album (Image credit: Burton C\nBell & Fear Factory)\n\nKeen to avoid any further delays, the band swiftly abandoned Chicago for\nBearsville Studios in upstate New York. Esteemed British metal producer Colin\nRichardson was on board once again, having worked with the band on their\ndebut, and Bearsville itself had a formidable reputation as a studio where\nlegends like Alice Cooper and The Rolling Stones had committed classics to\ntape.\n\n\u201cBearsville is out in the fields in the middle of nowhere!\u201d Dino chuckles. \u201cWe\nwere city boys in the fucking mountains. While we were there, Faith No More\nwere in one room, Bon Jovi were in the other, and we were in the middle. Let\u2019s\njust say we hung out with Faith No More a lot, ha ha! We started doing drums\nand everything was going great, but when we started on guitars we hit a brick\nwall. Colin didn\u2019t like my guitar tone. We fought about it for two weeks and\ndidn\u2019t record one fucking note!\u201d\n\nIn conflict with their producer, Dino and Burton could feel time slipping away\nand their budget rapidly evaporating. Colin remained adamant that Dino should\nchange his equipment. Dino told Colin to fuck off.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Fuck you, this is my sound!\u2019 you know? One day I was so\nfrustrated, I walked down to a fruit stand at the bottom of the hill from the\nstudio,\u201d says the guitarist. \u201cThere was a guy working there and he looked\nfamiliar, and it was the guitarist from [DC hardcore legends] Bad Brains, Dr\nKnow! So I started talking with him and told him what was going on, and he\nsaid, \u2018I\u2019ve got some stuff you could use!\u2019 So we plugged my amplifier into his\ncabinet and suddenly, boom, the tone was there! Everyone was wiping the sweat\noff their foreheads, you know? Ha ha!\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Burton C Bell & Fear Factory)\n\nWith the deadlock broken, the making of Demanufacture began in earnest. With a\ngreater emphasis on keyboards, samples and sound effects, but still driven\nforward by that synchronised and mechanistic blend of riffs and kick drums,\nthe album\u2019s 11 songs promised to be a radical new manifesto for metal. But\nsuch was the focus and ferocity of Dino Cazares\u2019s vision for the album that he\nwas rapidly coming to the conclusion that Colin Richardson was no longer the\nright man to mix it.\n\n\u201cProducers hear things differently sometimes,\u201d says Rhys Fulber. \u201cBut Dino was\nvehemently opposed to doing it Colin\u2019s way. It\u2019s a little bit sad that it was\nallowed to roll and a whole bunch of money was spent, but Colin did contribute\ngreat stuff to that record.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing against Colin, he\u2019s brilliant, but I felt that we\u2019d moved in a\ndifferent direction,\u201d explains Dino. \u201cIf he\u2019d mixed it, it would\u2019ve sounded\nlike a typical metal record, and we needed to be outside the box. The first\nmix was horrible; the keyboards weren\u2019t in the forefront, and we wanted them\nloud, so we took back control of the record. We started mixing the album with\nRhys and [Frontline Assembly engineer/producer] Greg Reely and the first song\nthat Greg mixed, we were like, \u2018Oh my god, this is it!\u2019\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Burton C Bell & Fear Factory)\n\n\u201cWe were at Enterprise Studio in Burbank, in this big room where they\u2019d edit\nmusic and sound for films,\u201d Burton recalls. \u201cIn front of this big, beautiful\nmixing desk there was this 20-foot movie screen, so we would play Bladerunner,\nTerminator, Apocalypse Now and Robocop, or Raymond [Herrera, ex-Fear Factory\ndrummer] would be playing Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter on this huge screen,\nand that\u2019s how we\u2019d get our inspiration. It was an exciting, fun time.\u201d\n\nDemanufacture was released on June 13, 1995, replete with fittingly\ngroundbreaking artwork courtesy of noted graphic artist Dave McKean, and soon\naccrued some of that year\u2019s most ecstatic reviews. It went on to become a huge\nsuccess and its influence on successive generations of metal bands is\nunquestionable. Fear Factory\u2019s next album, Obsolete, would be even more\nsuccessful and earn the band their only gold record in the US. However, it is\nfor Demanufacture that Burton and Dino will inevitably be best remembered when\nthey eventually hang up their boots. This December, they will hit the UK for a\nrun of headlining dates, performing Demanufacture in its immaculate entirety.\nFear Factory are one of the few bands that have the perfect excuse for\nrevisiting the past: above all else, Demanufacture was ahead of its time and\nalmost eerily prescient on multiple levels. Two decades on, it still sounds\nlike the future.\n\n(Image credit: Burton C Bell & Fear Factory)\n\n\u201cIt really is a masterpiece and Fear Factory don\u2019t get the credit they deserve\nfor being innovators,\u201d says Monte Conner. \u201cTheir sound and their concept is\nonly getting more relevant as time goes by.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemanufacture put us on the map,\u201d Burton concludes. \u201cWe were ahead of our\ntime. What we did was raw and real and instinctive. That raw energy just\nwasn\u2019t for the mainstream and I\u2019m fine with that. I never wanted to be a\nmainstream artist. I wanted to be on the fringe and dangerous, and\nDemanufacture is still dangerous.\u201d\n\nDom Lawson\n\nWriter\n\nDom Lawson has been writing for Metal Hammer and Prog for over 14 years and is\nextremely fond of heavy metal, progressive rock, coffee and snooker.
