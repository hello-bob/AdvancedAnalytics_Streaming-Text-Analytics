Dennett\nwas a young scholar who wanted to get philosophers out of their armchairs and\ninto conversations with psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists. \u201cI\ntried in \u2018Brainstorms\u2019 to write about the problems in language accessible to\nall serious thinkers, as jargon-free as possible, with lots of examples,\u201d he\nwrites in the preface to the 40^th-anniversary edition of the book.\n\nSome of the chapters contained in the collection cast longer shadows than\nothers. \u201cWhere Am I?,\u201d featured below in its entirety, has had a remarkable\ntrajectory. In 1979, it was nearly turned into a Hollywood film (ultimately\nabandoned when it was found that a sci-fi magazine with a faintly similar\nstoryline published a few years earlier). In 1981, the main scene from the\nessay was rendered in a BBC science documentary \u201cin which,\u201d Dennett writes, \u201cI\nappear, looking at my own brain in a fabulous fountain/vat on a pedestal in\nfront of whirring computer tape drives (remember those?), and wondering why I\nam saying \u2018Here I am staring at my own brain in a vat\u2019 instead of \u2018Here I am,\nin a vat, being stared at by my own eyes.\u2019\u201d Later it was represented in both a\nJavanese shadow puppet play and a feature-length film starring Dennett and the\ncomputer scientist Douglas Hofstadter.\n\nDennett is quick to admit he didn\u2019t invent the concept of the brain in the\nvat, nor was he the first philosopher to entertain the idea. That credit goes\nto Gil Harman, he believes, whose 1973 book \u201cThought\u201d includes this brief\npassage that put the idea in his head:\n\n> Or perhaps you do not even have a body. Maybe you were in an accident and\n> all that could be saved was your brain, which is kept alive in the\n> laboratory. For your amusement you are being fed a tape from the twentieth\n> century. Of course, that is to assume that you have to have a brain in order\n> to have experiences; and that might be just part of the myth you are being\n> given.\n\nDennett concocted the first version of his tale in 1976 while driving on the\nMass Pike from Tufts University to Vassar College, where he was to give a\ncolloquium. That evening he ad-libbed the story and then spent \u201cseveral\nhilarious hours considering its implications and complications\u201d with his\nstudents. \u201cI would guess that \u2018Where am I?\u2019 has been on the syllabus of more\nphilosophy courses than anything else I have written,\u201d he writes in the\npreface, \u201cand some Vassar undergraduates deserve a bit of the credit.\u201d\n\nDaniel Dennett died last month at the age of 82.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve won my suit under the Freedom of Information Act, I am at\nliberty to reveal for the first time a curious episode in my life that may be\nof interest not only to those engaged in research in the philosophy of mind,\nartificial intelligence and neuroscience but also to the general public.\n\nSeveral years ago I was approached by Pentagon officials who asked me to\nvolunteer for a highly dangerous and secret mission. In collaboration with\nNASA and Howard Hughes, the Department of Defense was spending billions to\ndevelop a Supersonic Tunneling Underground Device, or STUD. It was supposed to\ntunnel through the earth\u2019s core at great speed and deliver a specially\ndesigned atomic warhead \u201cright up the Red\u2019s missile silos,\u201d as one of the\nPentagon brass put it.\n\nThis story is excerpted from Daniel C. Dennett\u2019s book \u201cBrainstorms:\nPhilosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology\u201c\n\nThe problem was that in an early test they had succeeded in lodging a warhead\nabout a mile deep under Tulsa, Oklahoma, and they wanted me to retrieve it for\nthem. \u201cWhy me?\u201d I asked. Well, the mission involved some pioneering\napplications of current brain research, and they had heard of my interest in\nbrains and of course my Faustian curiosity and great courage and so forth ...\nWell, how could I refuse? The difficulty that brought the Pentagon to my door\nwas that the device I\u2019d been asked to recover was fiercely radioactive, in a\nnew way. According to monitoring instruments, something about the nature of\nthe device and its complex interactions with pockets of material deep in the\nearth had produced radiation that could cause severe abnormalities in certain\ntissues of the brain. No way had been found to shield the brain from these\ndeadly rays, which were apparently harmless to other tissues and organs of the\nbody. So it had been decided that the person sent to recover the device should\nleave his brain behind. It would be kept in a safe place where it could\nexecute its normal control functions by elaborate radio links. Would I submit\nto a surgical procedure that would completely remove my brain, which would\nthen be placed in a life-support system at the Manned Spacecraft Center in\nHouston? Each input and output pathway, as it was severed, would be restored\nby a pair of microminiaturized radio transceivers, one attached precisely to\nthe brain, the other to the nerve stumps in the empty cranium. No information\nwould be lost, all the connectivity would be preserved. At first I was a bit\nreluctant. Would it really work? The Houston brain surgeons encouraged me.\n\u201cThink of it,\u201d they said, \u201cas a mere stretching of the nerves. If your brain\nwere just moved over an inch in your skull, that would not alter or impair\nyour mind. We\u2019re simply going to make the nerves indefinitely elastic by\nsplicing radio links into them.\u201d\n\nI was shown around the life-support lab in Houston and saw the sparkling new\nvat in which my brain would be placed, were I to agree. I met the large and\nbrilliant support team of neurologists, hematologists, biophysicists, and\nelectrical engineers, and after several days of discussions and\ndemonstrations, I agreed to give it a try. I was subjected to an enormous\narray of blood tests, brain scans, experiments, interviews, and the like. They\ntook down my autobiography at great length, recorded tedious lists of my\nbeliefs, hopes, fears, and tastes. They even listed my favorite stereo\nrecordings and gave me a crash session of psychoanalysis.\n\nThe day for surgery arrived at last and of course I was anesthetized and\nremember nothing of the operation itself. When I came out of anesthesia, I\nopened my eyes, looked around, and asked the inevitable, the traditional, the\nlamentably hackneyed post-operative question: \u201cWhere am I?\u201d The nurse smiled\ndown at me. \u201cYou\u2019re in Houston,\u201d she said, and I reflected that this still had\na good chance of being the truth one way or another. She handed me a mirror.\nSure enough, there were the tiny antennae poking up through their titanium\nports cemented into my skull.\n\n\u201cI gather the operation was a success,\u201d I said, \u201cI want to go see my brain.\u201d\nThey led me (I was a bit dizzy and unsteady) down a long corridor and into the\nlife-support lab. A cheer went up from the assembled support team, and I\nresponded with what I hoped was a jaunty salute. Still feeling lightheaded, I\nwas helped over to the life-support vat. I peered through the glass. There,\nfloating in what looked like ginger ale, was undeniably a human brain, though\nit was almost covered with printed circuit chips, plastic tubules, electrodes,\nand other paraphernalia. \u201cIs that mine?\u201d I asked. \u201cHit the output transmitter\nswitch there on the side of the vat and see for yourself,\u201d the project\ndirector replied. I moved the switch to OFF, and immediately slumped, groggy\nand nauseated, into the arms of the technicians, one of whom kindly restored\nthe switch to its ON position. While I recovered my equilibrium and composure,\nI thought to myself: \u201cWell, here I am, sitting on a folding chair, staring\nthrough a piece of plate glass at my own brain ... But wait,\u201d I said to\nmyself, \u201cshouldn\u2019t I have thought, \u2018Here I am, suspended in a bubbling fluid,\nbeing stared at by my own eyes\u2019?\u201d I tried to think this latter thought. I\ntried to project it into the tank, offering it hopefully to my brain, but I\nfailed to carry off the exercise with any conviction. I tried again. \u201cHere am\nI, Daniel Dennett, suspended in a bubbling fluid, being stared at by my own\neyes.\u201d No, it just didn\u2019t work. Most puzzling and confusing. Being a\nphilosopher of firm physicalist conviction, I believed unswervingly that the\ntokening of my thoughts was occurring somewhere in my brain: yet, when I\nthought \u201cHere I am,\u201d where the thought occurred to me was here, outside the\nvat, where I, Dennett, was standing staring at my brain.\n\nAlso by Daniel DennettDid HAL Commit Murder?\n\nI tried and tried to think myself into the vat, but to no avail. I tried to\nbuild up to the task by doing mental exercises. I thought to myself, \u201cThe sun\nis shining over there,\u201d five times in rapid succession, each time mentally\nostending a different place: in order, the sun-lit corner of the lab, the\nvisible front lawn of the hospital, Houston, Mars, and Jupiter. I found I had\nlittle difficulty in getting my \u201cthere\u2019s\u201d to hop all over the celestial map\nwith their proper references. I could loft a \u201cthere\u201d in an instant through the\nfarthest reaches of space, and then aim the next \u201cthere\u201d with pinpoint\naccuracy at the upper left quadrant of a freckle on my arm. Why was I having\nsuch trouble with \u201chere\u201d? \u201cHere in Houston\u201d worked well enough, and so did\n\u201chere in the lab,\u201d and even \u201chere in this part of the lab,\u201d but \u201chere in the\nvat\u201d always seemed merely an unmeant mental mouthing. I tried closing my eyes\nwhile thinking it. This seemed to help, but still I couldn\u2019t manage to pull it\noff, except perhaps for a fleeting instant. I couldn\u2019t be sure. The discovery\nthat I couldn\u2019t be sure was also unsettling. How did I know where I meant by\n\u201chere\u201d when I thought \u201chere\u201d? Could I think I meant one place when in fact I\nmeant another? I didn\u2019t see how that could be admitted without untying the few\nbonds of intimacy between a person and his own mental life that had survived\nthe onslaught of the brain scientists and philosophers, the physicalists and\nbehaviorists. Perhaps I was incorrigible about where I meant when I said\n\u201chere.\u201d But in my present circumstances it seemed that either I was doomed by\nsheer force of mental habit to thinking systematically false indexical\nthoughts, or where a person is (and hence where his thoughts are tokened for\npurposes of semantic analysis) is not necessarily where his brain, the\nphysical seat of his soul, resides. Nagged by confusion, I attempted to orient\nmyself by falling back on a favorite philosopher\u2019s ploy. I began naming\nthings.\n\n\u201cYorick,\u201d I said aloud to my brain, \u201cyou are my brain. The rest of my body,\nseated in this chair, I dub \u2018Hamlet.\u2019\u201d So here we all are: Yorick\u2019s my brain,\nHamlet\u2019s my body, and I am Dennett. Now, where am I? And when I think \u201cwhere\nam I?\u201d where\u2019s that thought tokened? Is it tokened in my brain, lounging about\nin the vat, or right here between my ears where it seems to be tokened? Or\nnowhere? Its temporal coordinates give me no trouble; must it not have spatial\ncoordinates as well? I began making a list of the alternatives.\n\n(1) Where Hamlet goes, there goes Dennett. This principle was easily refuted\nby appeal to the familiar brain transplant thought-experiments so enjoyed by\nphilosophers. If Tom and Dick switch brains, Tom is the fellow with Dick\u2019s\nformer body \u2014 just ask him; he\u2019ll claim to be Tom, and tell you the most\nintimate details of Tom\u2019s autobiography. It was clear enough, then, that my\ncurrent body and I could part company, but not likely that I could be\nseparated from my brain. The rule of thumb that emerged so plainly from the\nthought experiments was that in a brain-transplant operation, one wanted to be\nthe donor, not the recipient. Better to call such an operation a body-\ntransplant, in fact. So perhaps the truth was,\n\n(2) Where Yorick goes, there goes Dennett. This was not at all appealing,\nhowever. How could I be in the vat and not about to go anywhere, when I was so\nobviously outside the vat looking in and beginning to make guilty plans to\nreturn to my room for a substantial lunch? This begged the question I\nrealized, but it still seemed to be getting at something important. Casting\nabout for some support for my intuition, I hit upon a legalistic sort of\nargument that might have appealed to Locke.\n\nSuppose, I argued to myself, I were now to fly to California, rob a bank, and\nbe apprehended. In which state would I be tried: In California, where the\nrobbery took place, or in Texas, where the brains of the outfit were located?\nWould I be a California felon with an out-of-state brain, or a Texas felon\nremotely controlling an accomplice of sorts in California? It seemed possible\nthat I might beat such a rap just on the undecidability of that jurisdictional\nquestion, though perhaps it would be deemed an inter-state, and hence Federal,\noffense. In any event, suppose I were convicted. Was it likely that California\nwould be satisfied to throw Hamlet into the brig, knowing that Yorick was\nliving the good life and luxuriously taking the waters in Texas? Would Texas\nincarcerate Yorick, leaving Hamlet free to take the next boat to Rio? This\nalternative appealed to me. Barring capital punishment or other cruel and\nunusual punishment, the state would be obliged to maintain the life-support\nsystem for Yorick though they might move him from Houston to Leavenworth, and\naside from the unpleasantness of the opprobrium, I, for one, would not mind at\nall and would consider myself a free man under those circumstances. If the\nstate has an interest in forcibly relocating persons in institutions, it would\nfail to relocate me in any institution by locating Yorick there. If this were\ntrue, it suggested a third alternative.\n\n(3) Dennett is wherever he thinks he is. Generalized, the claim was as\nfollows: At any given time a person has a point of view, and the location of\nthe point of view (which is determined internally by the content of the point\nof view) is also the location of the person.\n\nSuch a proposition is not without its perplexities, but to me it seemed a step\nin the right direction. The only trouble was that it seemed to place one in a\nheads-I-win/tails-you-lose situation of unlikely infallibility as regards\nlocation. Hadn\u2019t I myself often been wrong about where I was, and at least as\noften uncertain? Couldn\u2019t one get lost? Of course, but getting lost\ngeographically is not the only way one might get lost. If one were lost in the\nwoods one could attempt to reassure oneself with the consolation that at least\none knew where one was: one was right here in the familiar surroundings of\none\u2019s own body. Perhaps in this case one would not have drawn one\u2019s attention\nto much to be thankful for. Still, there were worse plights imaginable, and I\nwasn\u2019t sure I wasn\u2019t in such a plight right now.\n\nPoint of view clearly had something to do with personal location, but it was\nitself an unclear notion. It was obvious that the content of one\u2019s point of\nview was not the same as or determined by the content of one\u2019s beliefs or\nthoughts. For example, what should we say about the point of view of the\nCinerama viewer who shrieks and twists in his seat as the roller-coaster\nfootage overcomes his psychic distancing? Has he forgotten that he is safely\nseated in the theater? Here I was inclined to say that the person is\nexperiencing an illusory shift in point of view. In other cases, my\ninclination to call such shifts illusory was less strong. The workers in\nlaboratories and plants who handle dangerous materials by operating feedback-\ncontrolled mechanical arms and hands undergo a shift in point of view that is\ncrisper and more pronounced than anything Cinerama can provoke. They can feel\nthe heft and slipperiness of the containers they manipulate with their metal\nfingers. They know perfectly well where they are and are not fooled into false\nbeliefs by the experience, yet it is as if they were inside the isolation\nchamber they are peering into. With mental effort, they can manage to shift\ntheir point of view back and forth, rather like making a transparent Neckar\ncube or an Escher drawing change orientation before one\u2019s eyes. It does seem\nextravagant to suppose that in performing this bit of mental gymnastics, they\nare transporting themselves back and forth.\n\nStill their example gave me hope. If I was in fact in the vat in spite of my\nintuitions, I might be able to train myself to adopt that point of view even\nas a matter of habit. I should dwell on images of myself comfortably floating\nin my vat, beaming volitions to that familiar body out there. I reflected that\nthe ease or difficulty of this task was presumably independent of the truth\nabout the location of one\u2019s brain. Had I been practicing before the operation,\nI might now be finding it second nature. You might now yourself try such a\ntromp l\u2019oeil. Imagine you have written an inflammatory letter which has been\npublished in the Times, the result of which is that the Government has chosen\nto impound your brain for a probationary period of three years in its\nDangerous Brain Clinic in Bethesda, Maryland. Your body of course is allowed\nfreedom to earn a salary and thus to continue its function of laying up income\nto be taxed. At this moment, however, your body is seated in an auditorium\nlistening to a peculiar account by Daniel Dennett of his own similar\nexperience. Try it. Think yourself to Bethesda, and then hark back longingly\nto your body, far away, and yet seeming so near. It is only with long-distance\nrestraint (yours? the Government\u2019s?) that you can control your impulse to get\nthose hands clapping in polite applause before navigating the old body to the\nrest room and a well-deserved glass of evening sherry in the lounge. The task\nof imagination is certainly difficult, but if you achieve your goal the\nresults might be consoling.\n\nAnyway, there I was in Houston, lost in thought as one might say, but not for\nlong. My speculations were soon interrupted by the Houston doctors, who wished\nto test out my new prosthetic nervous system before sending me off on my\nhazardous mission. As I mentioned before, I was a bit dizzy at first, and not\nsurprisingly, although I soon habituated myself to my new circumstances (which\nwere, after all, well nigh indistinguishable from my old circumstances). My\naccommodation was not perfect, however, and to this day I continue to be\nplagued by minor coordination difficulties. The speed of light is fast, but\nfinite, and as my brain and body move farther and farther apart, the delicate\ninteraction of my feedback systems is thrown into disarray by the time lags.\nJust as one is rendered close to speechless by a delayed or echoic hearing of\none\u2019s speaking voice so, for instance, I am virtually unable to track a moving\nobject with my eyes whenever my brain and my body are more than a few miles\napart. In most matters my impairment is scarcely detectable, though I can no\nlonger hit a slow curve ball with the authority of yore. There are some\ncompensations of course. Though liquor tastes as good as ever, and warms my\ngullet while corroding my liver, I can drink it in any quantity I please,\nwithout becoming the slightest bit inebriated, a curiosity some of my close\nfriends may have noticed (though I occasionally have feigned inebriation, so\nas not to draw attention to my unusual circumstances). For similar reasons, I\ntake aspirin orally for a sprained wrist, but if the pain persists I ask\nHouston to administer codeine to me in vitro. In times of illness the phone\nbill can be staggering.\n\nBut to return to my adventure. At length, both the doctors and I were\nsatisfied that I was ready to undertake my subterranean mission. And so I left\nmy brain in Houston and headed by helicopter for Tulsa. Well, in any case,\nthat\u2019s the way it seemed to me. That\u2019s how I would put it, just off the top of\nmy head as it were. On the trip I reflected further about my earlier anxieties\nand decided that my first postoperative speculations had been tinged with\npanic. The matter was not nearly as strange or metaphysical as I had been\nsupposing. Where was I? In two places, clearly: both inside the vat and\noutside it. Just as one can stand with one foot in Connecticut and the other\nin Rhode Island, I was in two places at once. I had become one of those\nscattered individuals we used to hear so much about. The more I considered\nthis answer, the more obviously true it appeared. But, strange to say, the\nmore true it appeared, the less important the question to which it could be\nthe true answer seemed. A sad, but not unprecedented, fate for a philosophical\nquestion to suffer. This answer did not completely satisfy me, of course.\nThere lingered some question to which I should have liked an answer, which was\nneither \u201cWhere are all my various and sundry parts?\u201d nor \u201cWhat is my current\npoint of view?\u201d Or at least there seemed to be such a question. For it did\nseem undeniable that in some sense I and not merely most of me was descending\ninto the earth under Tulsa in search of an atomic warhead.\n\nWhen I found the warhead, I was certainly glad I had left my brain behind, for\nthe pointer on the specially built Geiger counter I had brought with me was\noff the dial. I called Houston on my ordinary radio and told the operation\ncontrol center of my position and my progress. In return, they gave me\ninstructions for dismantling the vehicle, based upon my on-site observations.\nI had set to work with my cutting torch when all of a sudden a terrible thing\nhappened. I went stone deaf. At first I thought it was only my radio earphones\nthat had broken, but when I tapped on my helmet, I heard nothing. Apparently\nthe auditory transceivers had gone on the fritz. I could no longer hear\nHouston or my own voice, but I could speak, so I started telling them what had\nhappened. In mid-sentence, I knew something else had gone wrong. My vocal\napparatus had become paralyzed. Then my right hand went limp \u2014 another\ntransceiver had gone. I was truly in deep trouble. But worse was to follow.\nAfter a few more minutes, I went blind. I cursed my luck, and then I cursed\nthe scientists who had led me into this grave peril. There I was, deaf, dumb,\nand blind, in a radioactive hole more than a mile under Tulsa. Then the last\nof my cerebral radio links broke, and suddenly I was faced with a new and even\nmore shocking problem: whereas an instant before I had been buried alive in\nOklahoma, now I was disembodied in Houston. My recognition of my new status\nwas not immediate. It took me several very anxious minutes before it dawned on\nme that my poor body lay several hundred miles away, with heart pulsing and\nlungs respirating, but otherwise as dead as the body of any heart transplant\ndonor, its skull packed with useless, broken electronic gear. The shift in\nperspective I had earlier found well nigh impossible now seemed quite natural.\nThough I could think myself back into my body in the tunnel under Tulsa, it\ntook some effort to sustain the illusion. For surely it was an illusion to\nsuppose I was still in Oklahoma: I had lost all contact with that body.\n\nIt occurred to me then, with one of those rushes of revelation of which we\nshould be suspicious, that I had stumbled upon an impressive demonstration of\nthe immateriality of the soul based upon physicalist principles and premises.\nFor as the last radio signal between Tulsa and Houston died away, had I not\nchanged location from Tulsa to Houston at the speed of light? And had I not\naccomplished this without any increase in mass? What moved from A to B at such\nspeed was surely myself, or at any rate my soul or mind \u2014 the massless center\nof my being and home of my consciousness. My point of view had lagged somewhat\nbehind, but I had already noted the indirect bearing of point of view on\npersonal location. I could not see how a physicalist philosopher could quarrel\nwith this except by taking the dire and counter-intuitive route of banishing\nall talk of persons. Yet the notion of personhood was so well entrenched in\neveryone\u2019s world view, or so it seemed to me, that any denial would be as\ncuriously unconvincing, as systematically disingenuous, as the Cartesian\nnegation, \u201cnon sum.\u201d\n\nThe joy of philosophic discovery thus tided me over some very bad minutes or\nperhaps hours as the helplessness and hopelessness of my situation became more\napparent to me. Waves of panic and even nausea swept over me, made all the\nmore horrible by the absence of their normal body-dependent phenomenology. No\nadrenaline rush of tingles in the arms, no pounding heart, no premonitory\nsalivation. I did feel a dread sinking feeling in my bowels at one point, and\nthis tricked me momentarily into the false hope that I was undergoing a\nreversal of the process that landed me in this fix \u2014 a gradual\nundisembodiment. But the isolation and uniqueness of that twinge soon\nconvinced me that it was simply the first of a plague of phantom body\nhallucinations that I, like any other amputee, would be all too likely to\nsuffer.\n\nMy mood then was chaotic. On the one hand, I was fired up with elation at my\nphilosophic discovery and was wracking my brain (one of the few familiar\nthings I could still do), trying to figure out how to communicate my discovery\nto the journals; while on the other, I was bitter, lonely, and filled with\ndread and uncertainty. Fortunately, this did not last long, for my technical\nsupport team sedated me into a dreamless sleep from which I awoke, hearing\nwith magnificent fidelity the familiar opening strains of my favorite Brahms\npiano trio. So that was why they had wanted a list of my favorite recordings!\nIt did not take me long to realize that I was hearing the music without ears.\nThe output from the stereo stylus was being fed through some fancy\nrectification circuitry directly into my auditory nerve. I was mainlining\nBrahms, an unforgettable experience for any stereo buff. At the end of the\nrecord it did not surprise me to hear the reassuring voice of the project\ndirector speaking into a microphone that was now my prosthetic ear. He\nconfirmed my analysis of what had gone wrong and assured me that steps were\nbeing taken to re-embody me. He did not elaborate, and after a few more\nrecordings, I found myself drifting off to sleep. My sleep lasted, I later\nlearned, for the better part of a year, and when I awoke, it was to find\nmyself fully restored to my senses. When I looked into the mirror, though, I\nwas a bit startled to see an unfamiliar face. Bearded and a bit heavier,\nbearing no doubt a family resemblance to my former face, and with the same\nlook of spritely intelligence and resolute character, but definitely a new\nface. Further self-explorations of an intimate nature left me no doubt that\nthis was a new body and the project director confirmed my conclusions. He did\nnot volunteer any information on the past history of my new body and I decided\n(wisely, I think in retrospect) not to pry. As many philosophers unfamiliar\nwith my ordeal have more recently speculated, the acquisition of a new body\nleaves one\u2019s person intact. And after a period of adjustment to a new voice,\nnew muscular strengths and weaknesses, and so forth, one\u2019s personality is by\nand large also preserved. More dramatic changes in personality have been\nroutinely observed in people who have undergone extensive plastic surgery, to\nsay nothing of sex change operations, and I think no one contests the survival\nof the person in such cases. In any event I soon accommodated to my new body,\nto the point of being unable to recover any of its novelties to my\nconsciousness or even memory. The view in the mirror soon became utterly\nfamiliar. That view, by the way, still revealed antennae, and so I was not\nsurprised to learn that my brain had not been moved from its haven in the\nlife-support lab.\n\nI decided that good old Yorick deserved a visit. I and my new body, whom we\nmight as well call Fortinbras, strode into the familiar lab to another round\nof applause from the technicians, who were of course congratulating\nthemselves, not me. Once more I stood before the vat and contemplated poor\nYorick, and on a whim I once again cavalierly flicked off the output\ntransmitter switch. Imagine my surprise when nothing unusual happened. No\nfainting spell, no nausea, no noticeable change. A technician hurried to\nrestore the switch to ON, but still I felt nothing. I demanded an explanation,\nwhich the project director hastened to provide. It seems that before they had\neven operated on the first occasion, they had constructed a computer duplicate\nof my brain, reproducing both the complete information processing structure\nand the computational speed of my brain in a giant computer program. After the\noperation, but before they had dared to send me off on my mission to Oklahoma,\nthey had run this computer system and Yorick side by side. The incoming\nsignals from Hamlet were sent simultaneously to Yorick\u2019s transceivers and to\nthe computer\u2019s array of inputs. And the outputs from Yorick were not only\nbeamed back to Hamlet, my body; they were recorded and checked against the\nsimultaneous output of the computer program, which was called \u201cHubert\u201d for\nreasons obscure to me. Over days and even weeks, the outputs were identical\nand synchronous, which of course did not prove that they had succeeded in\ncopying the brain\u2019s functional structure, but the empirical support was\ngreatly encouraging.\n\nHubert\u2019s input, and hence activity, had been kept parallel with Yorick\u2019s\nduring my disembodied days. And now, to demonstrate this, they had actually\nthrown the master switch that put Hubert for the first time in online control\nof my body \u2014 not Hamlet, of course, but Fortinbras. (Hamlet, I learned, had\nnever been recovered from its underground tomb and could be assumed by this\ntime to have largely returned to the dust. At the head of my grave still lay\nthe magnificent bulk of the abandoned device, with the word STUD emblazoned on\nits side in large letters \u2014 a circumstance which may provide archeologists of\nthe next century with a curious insight into the burial rites of their\nancestors.)\n\nThe laboratory technicians now showed me the master switch, which had two\npositions, labeled B, for Brain (they didn\u2019t know my brain\u2018s name was Yorick)\nand H, for Hubert. The switch did indeed point to H, and they explained to me\nthat if I wished, I could switch it back to B. With my heart in my mouth (and\nmy brain in its vat), I did this. Nothing happened. A click, that was all. To\ntest their claim, and with the master switch now set at B, I hit Yorick\u2019s\noutput transmitter switch on the vat and sure enough, I began to faint. Once\nthe output switch was turned back on and I had recovered my wits, so to speak,\nI continued to play with the master switch, flipping it back and forth. I\nfound that with the exception of the transitional click, I could detect no\ntrace of a difference. I could switch in mid-utterance, and the sentence I had\nbegun speaking under the control of Yorick was finished without a pause or\nhitch of any kind under the control of Hubert. I had a spare brain, a\nprosthetic device which might someday stand me in very good stead, were some\nmishap to befall Yorick. Or alternatively, I could keep Yorick as a spare and\nuse Hubert. It didn\u2019t seem to make any difference which I chose, for the wear\nand tear and fatigue on my body did not have any debilitating effect on either\nbrain, whether or not it was actually causing the motions of my body, or\nmerely spilling its output into thin air.\n\nThe one truly unsettling aspect of this new development was the prospect,\nwhich was not long in dawning on me, of someone detaching the spare \u2014 Hubert\nor Yorick, as the case might be \u2014 from Fortinbras and hitching it to yet\nanother body \u2014 some Johnny-come-lately Rosencrantz or Guildenstern. Then (if\nnot before) there would be two people, that much was clear. One would be me,\nand the other would be a sort of super-twin brother. If there were two bodies,\none under the control of Hubert and the other being controlled by Yorick, then\nwhich would the world recognize as the true Dennett? And whatever the rest of\nthe world decided, which one would be me? Would I be the Yorick-brained one,\nin virtue of Yorick\u2019s causal priority and former intimate relationship with\nthe original Dennett body, Hamlet? That seemed a bit legalistic, a bit too\nredolent of the arbitrariness of consanguinity and legal possession, to be\nconvincing at the metaphysical level. For, suppose that before the arrival of\nthe second body on the scene, I had been keeping Yorick as the spare for\nyears, and letting Hubert\u2019s output drive my body \u2014 that is, Fortinbras \u2014 all\nthat time. The Hubert-Fortinbras couple would seem then by squatter\u2019s rights\n(to combat one legal intuition with another) to be the true Dennett and the\nlawful inheritor of everything that was Dennett\u2019s. This was an interesting\nquestion, certainly, but not nearly so pressing as another question that\nbothered me. My strongest intuition was that in such an eventuality I would\nsurvive so long as either brain-body couple remained intact, but I had mixed\nemotions about whether I should want both to survive.\n\nI discussed my worries with the technicians and the project director. The\nprospect of two Dennetts was abhorrent to me, I explained, largely for social\nreasons. I didn\u2019t want to be my own rival for the affections of my wife, nor\ndid I like the prospect of the two Dennetts sharing my modest professor\u2019s\nsalary. Still more vertiginous and distasteful, though, was the idea of\nknowing that much about another person, while he had the very same goods on\nme. How could we ever face each other? My colleagues in the lab argued that I\nwas ignoring the bright side of the matter. Weren\u2019t there many things I wanted\nto do but, being only one person, had been unable to do? Now one Dennett could\nstay at home and be the professor and family man, while the other could strike\nout on a life of travel and adventure \u2014 missing the family of course, but\nhappy in the knowledge that the other Dennett was keeping the home fires\nburning. I could be faithful and adulterous at the same time. I could even\ncuckold myself \u2014 to say nothing of other more lurid possibilities my\ncolleagues were all too ready to force upon my overtaxed imagination. But my\nordeal in Oklahoma (or was it Houston?) had made me less adventurous, and I\nshrank from this opportunity that was being offered (though of course I was\nnever quite sure it was being offered to me in the first place).\n\nThere was another prospect even more disagreeable \u2014 that the spare, Hubert or\nYorick as the case might be, would be detached from any input from Fortinbras\nand just left detached. Then, as in the other case, there would be two\nDennetts, or at least two claimants to my name and possessions, one embodied\nin Fortinbras, and the other sadly, miserably disembodied. Both selfishness\nand altruism bade me take steps to prevent this from happening. So I asked\nthat measures be taken to ensure that no one could ever tamper with the\ntransceiver connections or the master switch without my (our? no, my)\nknowledge and consent. Since I had no desire to spend my life guarding the\nequipment in Houston, it was mutually decided that all the electronic\nconnections in the lab would be carefully locked: both those that controlled\nthe life-support system for Yorick and those that controlled the power supply\nfor Hubert would be guarded with fail-safe devices, and I would take the only\nmaster switch, outfitted for radio remote control, with me wherever I went. I\ncarry it strapped around my waist and \u2014 wait a moment \u2014 here it is. Every few\nmonths I reconnoiter the situation by switching channels. I do this only in\nthe presence of friends of course, for if the other channel were, heaven\nforbid, either dead or otherwise occupied, there would have to be somebody who\nhad my interests at heart to switch it back, to bring me back from the void.\nFor while I could feel, see, hear and otherwise sense whatever befell my body,\nsubsequent to such a switch, I\u2019d be unable to control it. By the way, the two\npositions on the switch are intentionally unmarked, so I never have the\nfaintest idea whether I am switching from Hubert to Yorick or vice versa.\n(Some of you may think that in this case I really don\u2019t know who I am, let\nalone where I am. But such reflections no longer make much of a dent on my\nessential Dennettness, on my own sense of who I am. If it is true that in one\nsense I don\u2019t know who l am then that\u2019s another one of your philosophical\ntruths of underwhelming significance.)\n\nIn any case, every time I\u2019ve flipped the switch so far, nothing has happened.\nSo let\u2019s give it a try ...\n\n\u201cTHANK GOD! I THOUGHT YOU\u2019D NEVER FLIP THAT SWITCH! You can\u2019t imagine how\nhorrible it\u2019s been these last two weeks \u2014 but now you know, it\u2019s your tum in\npurgatory. How I\u2019ve longed for this moment! You see, about two weeks ago \u2014\nexcuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but I\u2019ve got to explain this to my ... um,\nbrother, I guess you could say, but he\u2019s just told you the facts, so you\u2019ll\nunderstand \u2014 about two weeks ago our two brains drifted just a bit out of\nsync. I don\u2019t know whether my brain is now Hubert or Yorick, any more than you\ndo, but in any case, the two brains drifted apart, and of course once the\nprocess started, it snowballed, for I was in a slightly different receptive\nstate for the input we both received, a difference that was soon magnified. In\nno time at all the illusion that I was in control of my body \u2014 our body \u2014 was\ncompletely dissipated. There was nothing I could do \u2014 no way to call you. YOU\nDIDN\u2019T EVEN KNOW I EXISTED! It\u2019s been like being carried around in a cage, or\nbetter, like being possessed \u2014 hearing my own voice say things I didn\u2019t mean\nto say, watching in frustration as my own hands performed deeds I hadn\u2019t\nintended. You\u2019d scratch our itches, but not the way I would have, and you kept\nme awake, with your tossing and turning. I\u2019ve been totally exhausted, on the\nverge of a nervous breakdown, carried around helplessly by your frantic round\nof activities, sustained only by the knowledge that someday you\u2019d throw the\nswitch.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn, but at least you\u2019ll have the comfort of knowing I know\nyou\u2019re in there. Like an expectant mother, I\u2019m eating \u2014 or at any rate\ntasting, smelling, seeing \u2014 for two now, and I\u2019ll try to make it easy for you.\nDon\u2019t worry. Just as soon as this colloquium is over, you and I will fly to\nHouston, and we\u2019ll see what can be done to get one of us another body. You can\nhave a female body \u2014 your body could be any color you like. But let\u2019s think it\nover. I tell you what \u2014 to be fair, if we both want this body, I promise I\u2019ll\nlet the project director flip a coin to settle which of us gets to keep it and\nwhich then gets to choose a new body. That should guarantee justice, shouldn\u2019t\nit? In any case, I\u2019ll take care of you, I promise. These people are my\nwitnesses.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, this talk we have just heard is not exactly the talk I\nwould have given, but I assure you that everything he said was perfectly true.\nAnd now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I think I\u2019d \u2014 we\u2019d \u2014 better sit down.\u201d\n\nDaniel Dennett was a renowned American philosopher and cognitive scientist and\nthe author of several books, including \u201cBrainstorms,\u201d from which this article\nis excerpted.\n\nPosted on May 6\n\nFacebook Twitter Reddit Pocket Flipboard\n\nTagged in\n\nPhilosophy Science Fiction Short Story\n\nThe MIT Press is a mission-driven, not-for-profit scholarly publisher.
