Ron DeSantis. Senate Bill 1530 and\nHouse Bill 1365 would prohibit city and county governments from allowing\nhouseless people to sleep or camp on public property and rights of way. The\nbills call for the creation of encampment sites where houseless people will be\nallowed to stay and for a portion of funding to be directed toward mental\nhealth and shelter facilities. Houseless advocates and formerly houseless\nindividuals say the bills are discriminatory and dehumanizing toward houseless\npeople.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly discriminatory, racist, elitist, and repressive bill that\nlooks to dehumanize the poor, the Black, and the homeless and designate people\nas undesirable and take them out of the cities where they can\u2019t afford these\nincreasingly unaffordable, escalating skyrocketing rents and put them into\ncamps outside of cities,\u201d said David Peery, a formerly houseless advocate and\nthe founder of Miami Coalition to Advance Racial Equity. \u201cThis has been a\nlongstanding goal of certain really fascist repressive people throughout the\nyears.\u201d\n\nThe bills are now advancing through the Fiscal Policy committee in the Senate\nand the Health and Human Services Committee in the House. DeSantis expressed\nsupport for the bill during a press conference in Miami Beach on Feb. 4 but\nsaid he did not support the creation of encampments, \u201cparticularly in areas\nthat would interfere with the public conducting normal business.\u201d\n\nThe disapproval mirrors a similar \u201cNIMBY\u201d-ism (not in my back yard) that Miami\ncommissioners faced when they tried to move houseless individuals to a\nhistoric Black beach in 2022. After thousands of locals protested the\ndecision, some because of the inhospitable living conditions it would create\nfor houseless individuals and the environmental implications and others\nbecause of prejudice against having houseless individuals near their\nrecreational area, the idea was rejected. A location is still being\ndetermined.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why this proposal is unlikely to work is because ...\nnobody is going to want any type of homeless camp [anywhere] near where they\nwork or live,\u201d Peery said, adding that legislators are \u201cblinded\u201d by their\nhatred of the poor. \u201cThat just tells you that in their mind it\u2019s, \u2018Let\u2019s just\ndeport them to uninhabited islands. They\u2019re out of sight, out of mind.\u2019\u201d\n\nFlorida has had the third-largest houseless population in the nation since\n2020, behind California and New York. In 2023, the state had 30,809 unhoused\nindividuals, according to the annual report by Florida\u2019s Council on\nHomelessness.\n\nPeery and other advocates have been calling for a housing-first approach,\nwhich prioritizes providing housing for people so that their most basic needs\ncan be addressed. Conservative think tanks like the Cicero Institute strongly\noppose this model and have created model legislation that further criminalizes\nhouselessness.\n\n\u201cThese efforts have been spearheaded by very conservative think tanks, very\nconservative people that simply want to relegate the poor into the areas where\nthey cannot see them,\u201d Peery said. \u201cThey certainly want to use and exploit the\npoor for their labor in order to produce their wealth that they can use, but\nthey don\u2019t want to see them.\u201d\n\nIn the 2018 case Martin v. Boise, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that\nit\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment to criminalize camping on public property\nwhen the people in question have nowhere else they can legally sleep. In 2019,\nthe Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of that case. The case could now\nbe overturned in Grants Pass v. Johnson, when the Supreme Court decides\nwhether cities can legally ban or limit unhoused people camping in public\nspaces. If the Supreme Court rules that this prohibition is not cruel and\nunusual punishment, they could open the door for anyone camping out anywhere\nin the country to be arrested, whether a shelter bed is available or not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious thing, and it can absolutely have implications for this\nlaw that they\u2019re trying to pass in Florida,\u201d said October 22nd Alliance to End\nHomelessness Founder Jeff Weinberger. \u201cI think this is a horrible, horrible\nlaw. They are trying to control individuals\u2019 freedom of movement ... We have a\nconstitutionally protected freedom of movement in this country, and to tell\npeople that the only way they can exist in this world is if they\u2019re living in\na sanctioned encampment, where their lives are very much going to be\ncontrolled by the state, there\u2019s another name for that, and it\u2019s not\nencampment, it\u2019s prison.\u201d\n\nWeinberger urges citizens to contact their local officials and voice their\nconcerns with the bills.\n\n### Related\n\nTagged: Florida, houseless, houseless encampment, housing, politics, unhoused\n\n## Alexandra MartinezSenior News Reporter\n\nAlexandra is a Cuban-American writer based in Miami, with an interest in\nimmigration, the economy, gender justice, and the environment.
