The\nbenefit was reduced eye strain and a superior reading experience, without\nbeing tethered to any device.\n\nI continue to consume articles this way, with one exception: Long-form\narticles that are 20+ pages long. I often can\u2019t read them in one session. This\nadded a burden of keeping track of where I\u2019d left off. Reading should be fun,\nnot a chore.\n\nI solved this problem a different way: Convert it to an audio file and add to\na podcast feed so I can listen to it while driving. Let the podcast software\nkeep track of where I left off.\n\nMy prior experiments with text-to-speech systems failed to impress. The first\ntime was probably in \u201896 or \u201897, where I had Windows read out to me various\narticles from a local encyclopedia software. While I thought it pretty cool,\nthe proof was in the usage: I stopped using it within days.\n\nHow much has text-to-speech improved since and how much will it cost me?\n\nGoogle Cloud was the first service I tried. They support many different voices\nand accents. I wrote a script that would extract the text of an article, send\nit to Google Cloud, and save the result as a wav file locally. Since I didn\u2019t\nwant to try all the different voices, I randomly pick one each time.\n\nThe quality is better than I expected. Listening to small snippets, most will\nnot realize that these are computer generated voices. Only when you listen to\na whole article, you start noticing that the tone variation is relatively\nperiodic.\n\nHow much does this cost me?\n\nNothing.\n\nGoogle gives enough credits per month that so far I have not had to pay a dime\nto them. [1]\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a particular New Yorker article about Dan Ariely.\n\nYou can find my script here with some documentation here. It works by using\nMozilla\u2019s Readability feature that is embedded into Firefox, coupled with\nSimon Willison\u2019s shot-scraper tool. The hardest part, surprisingly, was\ngenerating the XML file that podcast readers need. I could not find a simple\nPython library to generate it, nor could I find any specs on what should be in\nthe XML file. I hacked an existing podcast\u2019s XML, modifying it for my needs.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[1]| There was one month where I saw a one cent charge from Google, and I\u2019m\nnot sure if it was due to this or one of those credit card verification\ncharges to see if the card is valid.  \n---|---  \n  \n  * Previous Article: Latent Spoilers\n\n", "frontpage": false}
