While initial air combat\noccurred during the opening days of the war, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of\nreporting about the situation in the air since. At the moment, both sides\ncontinue to fly different variants of the same aircraft \u2013 including the SU-25\nand MIG-29 \u2013 but one of the lesser seen jets has been the Sukhoi 27, an\naircraft which both sides have continued to use since the 1980s. We will make\na brief comparison between both sides and how their SU-27s compare.\n\nOn the Russian side are many variants of the SU-27 still in operation, but\nwithin the context of the Ukraine war, the only version seemingly in combat is\nthe Su-27SM, or Flanker-E.\n\nOn the Ukrainian side are a number of variants, each with slightly differing\nabilities; these are the SU-27P, S, and UB variants.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the differences between these aircraft, starting with the\nUkrainians.\n\nUKRAINIAN\n\nBeginning in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited\na fleet of Russian aircraft. Among them were roughly 70 SU-27s. Having issues\nwith sourcing parts, half of the inventory was grounded and six of these were\nsupposedly sold off. Today, it is reported that Ukraine is operating a total\nof 34 serviceable Su-27s. These early variants were at a clear disadvantage\nagainst more contemporary fighters; namely due to the lack of a modernised\nradar, multifunction displays, and the ability to use active radar guided\nmissiles.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2014, the Ukrainian SU-27 fleet was made up of three sub\nvariants; the SU-27-UB, S, and P. Three upgrade programs were initiated in\n2014 \u2013 although these were limited in scope. The goal was to modernise these\naircraft and bring them up to NATO standards. These would be the SU-27-UB-1M\nupgrade for the SU-27-UB, the SU-27-S-1M for the SU-27S, and the SU-27P-1M for\nthe SU-27-P. It is also possible that since the start of the war, other\nupgrade programs occurred without public announcement.\n\nThe biggest problem with these aircraft is that they lack fully integrated\nactive radar systems. Most appear to retain support for earlier semi-active\nradar guided missiles. This is a key difference from the Russian aircraft and\nwe will get into the details a bit later.\n\nRUSSIAN\n\nOn the Russian side is the SM variant, the only SU-27 known to regularly\noperate in this current war. The SM variant offers several crucial\nimprovements. Firstly, it is outfitted with modern multifunction displays,\nclearing much of the analogue cockpit clutter found in previous versions. This\nis driven by a more powerful computer, integrating a better electro optical\nsystem, and an upgraded radar. This upgraded mission computer allows the radar\nto generate synthetic aperture terrain mapping, and maritime target\nacquisition. Upgraded engines are also equipped on some models, whilst all SM\nvariants can use laser guided bombs, and several air to surface missiles,\nincluding the KH-31 and KH-29. Two sub variants \u2013 the SM2 and SM3 \u2013 also\nexist, with slight upgrades as well.\n\nA key advantage held by the Russian variant is its ability to carry active\nradar guided missiles. The most dangerous of these is the R-77, a BVR missile\ndesigned to compete with the AIM-120C. Other common loadouts include the\nactive R-27EA and R-27ET infrared optical for medium range, and the R-73\nArcher for close range. As highlighted by a Ukrainian MiG-29 pilot, the R-77\nmissile has given these Russian jets a distinct advantage.\n\nKEY DIFFERENCES\n\nThe most important difference between the Ukrainian and Russian Sukhoi 27\nvariants is the integration of active radar guided missiles. In modern combat\nthis is a necessary capability. The reason is simple; Ukrainian aircraft \u2013\nwith their semi-active radar guided missiles \u2013 require the launch aircraft to\nmaintain lock with the target until the missile hits. The missile\u2019s onboard\ncomputer cannot track the target on its own.\n\nIn contrast, most active radar guided missiles have onboard computers capable\nof locking and tracking the target autonomously. So, an aircraft equipped with\nactive radar missiles can launch and then break away to go defensive. An\naircraft with semi-active missiles cannot; they must hold lock with their\naircraft, which usually means continuously flying towards the target, as the\nradar gimbal can only rotate so far.\n\nTo put this into perspective, in a modern BVR fight, an aircraft will usually\nturn cold, or go defensive after firing a missile if there is a possibility\nthat an adversary has also fired a missile. Generally, a pilot wants to be\nflying at an angle no less than 90 degrees when going defensive against\nincoming missiles. Preferably, he would be flying in the opposite direction. A\npilot firing a semi active missile cannot do this, as most radar gimbals\ncannot pan more than 90 degrees. If the target goes beyond the gimbal limit,\nthe missile is useless.\n\nA Ukrainian pilot \u2013 when interviewed \u2013 said that the lack of such \u201cfire and\nforget\u201d missiles was the greatest problem for the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\nAnother important difference is the integration of a datalink system in the\nRussian variant of the aircraft. This is not a necessary technology, but it\ndoes offer some major advantages for co-ordination.\n\nThe Ukrainians may still yet upgrade their aircraft in the future. Since the\nwar started, both the SU-27 and MIG-29 underwent quick upgrade programs to\naccommodate AGM 88 anti-radiation missile to target SAM radars. There has also\nbeen some talk about an AMRAAM upgrade for both aircraft, although this seems\nunlikely. Integrating such weapons as AIM-120s into an eastern bloc aircraft\nwould cost a considerable amount of time and money, as it would not only\nentail producing new equipment specifically for both the Mig and Sukhoi, but\ncould also require radar upgrades and such.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWith all of this considered, it is easy to see just how important the Russian\nupgrade programs have been for keeping the SU-27 current. For Ukrainian\npilots, no amount of skill or training can improve radar capability, or\nmissile tracking. The arrival of the F-16 in Ukraine may change this balance,\nalthough it is difficult to say. The F-16s being delivered, (mid-life upgrade\nA/B models), are older than the Russian SU-27SMs, though they will at least\nhave active guided missile capabilities. The challenge will then be utilising\nolder AMRAAMs with their 50-mile range, against the 80 to 100 mile range of\nthe MIG-31K and SU-35S equipped with R-77s. This will be important to consider\ngiven the thick anti-air coverage from both sides along the front lines, which\nencourages both sides to fire off BVR missiles while still in friendly\nterritory before returning to base. For this reason, it does not seem\nrealistic that \u2013 as many online have advocated for \u2013 the Ukrainians go on some\nsort of air offensive into Russia. This could be disastrous for the ageing\nfleet of Sukhois.\n\nNevertheless, even with these disadvantages, Ukrainian pilots have pushed\nthese old aircraft to their limits. It is claimed \u2013 although it is hard to\nverify \u2013 that these old SU-27s continue to contest most of the Ukrainian air\nspace. If this is true, then this is a particularly impressive feat, given\nwhat they are up against, and it highlights how these older designs can still\nbe put to use in a defensive role.\n\nAs for the Russians, it is unlikely that the SU-27 upgrade programs will\ncontinue for too much longer. Despite its success as a design, many have been\nkeen to move on from the SU-27, and onto newer designs such as the SU-57 and\nSU-75 checkmate. While export variants continue to be built, the SU-35 may\nmark the last major development domestically. Nicknamed the \u2018Last Flanker\u2019,\nthe SU-35 will likely remain in service for some time, although from its\ninception as a spinoff of the SU-27M, it was always intended to be the interim\naircraft awaiting the arrival of 5^th and 6^th gen designs.\n\nNevertheless, just like the F-15, the Flanker is somewhat symbolic of 4^th gen\nfighters. It is still deadly and despite the hundreds of modern aircraft\nproduced in recent years, it is likely that we will continue to see it in the\nair for decades to come.\n\nAs for the Ukrainian Air Force\u2019s technology deficit compared to the Russians,\nit remains to be seen what new airpower will be brought to the table, and what\ndifference, if any, it will make for either side.\n\nMilitary Aviation Videos is a reader-supported publication.
