He throws up his\nhands and, in his first speech of the epic, proclaims lucky the ones who lie\ndead and buried in Troy. This is a moment of great despair; with it Vergil\npresents Aeneas as a man constantly on the point of just giving up. So why\ndoes he go on?\n\nMany feel he has no choice. As an agent of Rome\u2019s imperial fate, his personal\ndesires cannot guide him. There is no doubt that Vergil\u2019s Aeneas is a man torn\nnearly in two by what he wants and what he must do, yet there are moments in\nthe text where Aeneas\u2019s private desires and public mission form an uneasy\nalliance. One of these comes just after the storm has ended and Aeneas, along\nwith a few of his men, has washed ashore on the coast of Carthage. He needs\nhis men to keep going despite their \u201cgrieving hearts.\u201d Close to losing heart\nhimself, he dons a brave face for his men and utters one of the epic\u2019s most\nfamous lines: \u201cMaybe one day it will be pleasant to remember even these\nthings.\u201d Although this public utterance is at odds with his inner turmoil, it\nnevertheless helps the reader to glimpse the sort of private life he envisions\nif and when the mission succeeds.\n\nWhen I first read this line as a teenager, I found it appalling and\ninfuriating \u2014 Of course they will never remember any of this with pleasure!\nHis men have experienced war, death, exile, homelessness, divine wrath, and\nfind themselves yet again in a dangerous, unknown land. How could Aeneas offer\nsuch false hope? To me this line was blind to the full extent of their\nsuffering. It took years for me to come to terms with Aeneas\u2019s words here, and\nthis happened only gradually as the result of a deeply personal reading of the\ntext.\n\nMy reaction to this line changed profoundly two years ago in the aftermath of\nmy grandfather\u2019s death, an event that forever connected in my mind the story\nof the epic and my own family\u2019s history. My grandfather, a veteran of some of\nthe bloodiest combat of the Second World War, was able, decades later, to\nexperience exactly the kind of memory Vergil\u2019s Aeneas describes. He at last\nprovided me with an illustration that I could really grasp of what motivates\nAeneas\u2019s desire one day to remember past sufferings with pleasure. Although my\ngrandfather forms an unlikely parallel for Aeneas, the two are linked by their\nhorrifying experiences of war.\n\nJohn McCarter (Papaw) was born in 1922 and grew up on a small farm in the\nAppalachian mountains of East Tennessee. In December 1942 he enlisted (along\nwith four of his brothers) in the army with the full knowledge that he would\ngo to war. When asked in later years why he signed up, his answer never\nwavered: If he hadn\u2019t, another boy would have been drafted in his place.\n\nPapaw had never spent much time outside of East Tennessee before reporting for\nbasic training at Fort Benning, Georgia. There, he made one of the great\nfriends of his life, an Italian American from Pennsylvania named Joe Romano.\nPapaw later confessed to my brother that he and Joe promised each other they\nwould get in touch with the other\u2019s family if something happened to one of\nthem; I imagine many young soldiers made such promises. This would be a\npromise simply too painful for my grandfather to keep.\n\nIn 1943 Papaw set out with the 3rd Infantry Division on a converted cruise\nliner to Casablanca and then traveled across North Africa, where the fighting\nwas already over for the most part, to Tunisia. From there he went to Sicily\non the heels of the Allied invasions, and thence to Salerno. It would be on\nthe Italian mainland that he would find himself on the front lines of heavy\ncombat as part of the Allied assault on Monte Cassino and the amphibious\nlanding at Anzio. Papaw\u2019s journey mirrored that of Aeneas: from Tunisia (site\nof Dido\u2019s Carthage) to Sicily to Campania to Latium. Wars have a devastating\ntendency to repeat themselves.\n\nThe casualty numbers from Monte Cassino and Anzio are staggering by any\nmeasure. Tens upon tens of thousands of people died. Somehow Papaw survived.\nAt Monte Cassino he and a friend named Frank (a talented card shark, according\nto Papaw) were separated from their unit after it came under assault. Amid the\nartillery barrage Frank lost his helmet, so Papaw gave him the liner from his\nown, which, though hardly an effective defense, calmed him. They hid in the\nmountains, at one stage taking cover from enemy fire in a creek bed, for two\ndays before making it to an aid station.\n\nJoe Romano was killed at Monte Cassino on November 5, 1943. News of his death\nwould reach Papaw afterwards in Naples, where he was sent to train in\npreparation for the landing at Anzio. The allied forces would be pinned down\nthere for months, and Papaw, exhausted, was eventually pulled off the front\nlines and sent to a hospital in Naples, then home. He was suffering from what\nwe now believe was combat fatigue, and it was a fellow Tennessean named Sgt.\nCrawford that recognized his condition was poor and likely saved his life.\nThere are no doubt a thousand things I do not know about what my grandfather\nendured and what he had to do to survive. But those are not my memories to\nshare.\n\nGrowing up I always knew Papaw had been in the war, though he rarely spoke of\nit. He certainly would never have marched in a parade or invited accolades. He\nlived a quiet, simple life. He read, worked in the garden, played with his\ngrandkids, argued (at times relentlessly) about politics. He loved to tinker.\nAnd he took care of my grandmother, Gladys, as she grew frail with dementia.\nBut the war was always present in the background. My grandmother might reveal\nthat he had awoken her yet again by shielding her from enemy fire in his\nsleep. It would creep out in his dismay as again and again men went to war\nwith one another.\n\nAs a teenager I was too intrigued by my own daily dramas to ask him much about\nhis service. Then in college I became deeply interested in the Italy of an\naltogether different past, that of Vergil and Horace, and embarked on my own\nItalian adventure at the age of 21 to study abroad for the summer. I saw some\nof the same places he did \u2014 Salerno, Naples, Anzio \u2014 under vastly different\ncircumstances. A few days after my return, I went to his house, prepared to\ntell him all about my trip. I did not expect that he would be the one opening\nhimself up to me.\n\nWe spent the whole day poring over my photos and maps on his living room\nfloor, and together we compared our different paths through the same Italian\nsoil. Although I cannot imagine that Papaw ever looked back on his experiences\nwith pleasure, I am certain that his conversation with me that day was a\nsource of pleasure for him. By then it had become increasingly important for\nhim to remember, to acknowledge that part of his life but anchor it firmly in\nthe past.\n\nMuch is necessary for such remembering to occur. Time must intervene and be\nfilled with fresh memories of a life well lived. One has to feel that the\nsuffering mattered. My ability to go to Italy and walk in the same places he\nfought gave him such assurance. These places were frozen in his mind in a\nstate of turmoil, but my experiences of them animated them with new meaning.\nSomehow what he did meant that I could live a very different life, that\ngenerations of his own family flourished because of him. In the end it was the\ndeeply personal sense that he had accomplished something for those he loved\nthat took the bitter sting out of remembering a painful past.\n\nWhat Aeneas holds out to his men and to himself is the possibility that just\nmaybe they will have a life like my grandfather\u2019s \u2014 the one thing that could\nmake such suffering bearable. A life filled with family that grows across\ngenerations, defined not by the pain of the past but by the peace of mind\nthat, with enormous luck, comes once the intensity of war\u2019s fury has receded.\nAeneas\u2019s address to his men exposes his own personal hopes for life after war;\nconsolation comes not from the promise that he will found an empire he knows\nnothing about but from the possibility that he may simply enjoy his life again\none day.\n\nAeneas is by no means ready to remember anything with pleasure when Dido bids\nhim to recount Troy\u2019s fall, an act of memory that brings him, in the opening\nwords of Book 2, \u201cunspeakable grief.\u201d When he finally arrives in Italy, \u201cwars,\nhorrible wars\u201d await him yet again. Aeneas\u2019s final act in the epic, his\nretributive killing of Turnus, shows him drinking deeply of wrath and fury,\nand Vergil offers us no hint that such violence can ever be mollified. We\nalready know as early as the first book \u2014 it is unalterable fate \u2014 that Aeneas\nwill die shortly after the epic\u2019s conclusion. He will not live to see his son\ncome of age or generations emerge from his acts. Rome may win, but Aeneas\nhimself suffers profound personal loss.\n\nAnd yet memory remains of crucial importance to Aeneas. As he marches out to\nface Turnus in the final book, yearning for battle, he pauses for one last\nembrace with his young son. \u201cRemember me,\u201d he asks, \u201cin your ripe adulthood.\u201d\nHe recognizes that memory is no longer his to hope for, but he may yet bring\nabout for his son the kind of life that was once a consolation for himself and\nhis men. It is not Rome but a long, peaceful life that he urgently wants to\nbequeath to his son.\n\nMy grandfather helps me to understand this kind of remembering as well. The\nlast time I saw him at his own home, before the final days spent in hospitals\nand nursing homes with heart and kidney failure, he made a similar request of\nme. Knowing he would die soon, he asked me simply to remember him. The task of\nmemory had now been passed to me, and with this request Papaw, like Aeneas,\nsignaled his readiness for his final act to begin. Whereas remembering is a\npleasure only the living enjoy, being remembered is a solace left to the\ndying.\n\nTo me, Aeneas\u2019s desires to remember and be remembered resonate inextricably\nwith my grandfather\u2019s life and death. The gulf between me and the mythology of\nthe text contracts, and I can see the stakes faced by Aeneas with greater\nclarity. Viewing Aeneas through the lens of my grandfather helps me see just\nhow poignantly human he often is. This is a humanity that readers have not\nalways granted Aeneas; he is simply duty-bound, pious, at times merely the\nprototype of an ideal.\n\nInterpreting the Aeneid in light of my grandfather\u2019s WWII service is related\nto the ways in which that war influenced how so many read the poem. Viewed\nearlier in the century as a monument to imperialism, it was in the war\u2019s wake\nthat Vergil\u2019s readers, who had witnessed firsthand the dangers of such\nmovements, started to recognize the private cost of Aeneas\u2019s mission, and to\nuncover a strand of pessimism running alongside the epic\u2019s nationalistic\ntrajectory.\n\nJust as these works rarely emerge from the sweep of history with earlier\nreadings intact, so too must they be reread as we change. The reflection of my\ngrandfather that I see in Aeneas bears witness to the ways in which we bring\nour own histories to bear in our acts of reading. The Aeneid that I read at\neighteen is not same one I now read twenty years later as a mother of two\nyoung children, and it is not the same one I will read if I am lucky enough to\nshare my grandfather\u2019s longevity. Some of the best moments of reading come\nwhen there is a mutual disclosure between reader and text and bonds are formed\n\u2014 both of affinity and difference \u2014 that keep bringing us back to find new\nmeanings unlocked. One of the reasons such ancient works endure is their\nability to transform along with us and to shed light on who we are both\ncollectively and as individuals.\n\nMy grandfather never read the Aeneid, and if he were still here he could take\nissue with how I have read him. He might tell me that I have gotten his story\nall wrong. But in the end the memories we have of the dead are not that\ndifferent from texts to be interpreted. How we do so depends upon who we are\nand our private ties to those we remember. In the end, this is my grandfather\nas I construe him and the meaning that I derive from his life will change as I\nmyself change. I look forward to getting to know him again and again\nthroughout my life. In so many ways he lives on.\n\nImage courtesy of the author.\n\nTwitterShare\n\nThe Millions' future depends on your support.
