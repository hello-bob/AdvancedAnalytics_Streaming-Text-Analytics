(AP\nPhoto/Lindsey Wasson, File)\n\nHONOLULU \u2014 A single mother of two, Amy Chadwick spent years scrimping and\nsaving to buy a house in the town of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui.\nBut after a devastating fire leveled Lahaina in August and reduced Chadwick\u2019s\nhome to white dust, the cheapest rental she could find for her family and dogs\ncost $10,000 a month.\n\nChadwick, a fine-dining server, moved to Florida where she could stretch her\nhomeowners insurance dollars. She\u2019s worried Maui\u2019s exorbitant rental prices,\ndriven in part by vacation rentals that hog a limited housing supply, will\nhollow out her tight-knit town.\n\nMost people in Lahaina work for hotels, restaurants and tour companies and\ncan\u2019t afford $5,000 to $10,000 a month in rent, she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pushing out an entire community of service industry people. So no\none\u2019s going to be able to support the tourism that you\u2019re putting ahead of\nyour community,\u201d Chadwick said by phone from her new home in Satellite Beach\non Florida\u2019s Space Coast. \u201cNothing good is going to come of it unless they\ntake a serious stance, putting their foot down and really regulating these\nshort-term rentals.\u201d\n\nThe Aug. 8 wildfire killed 101 people and destroyed housing for 6,200\nfamilies, amplifying Maui\u2019s already acute housing shortage and laying bare the\nenormous presence of vacation rentals in Lahaina. It reminded lawmakers that\nshort-term rentals are an issue across Hawaii, prompting them to consider\nbills that would give counties the authority to phase them out.\n\nGov. Josh Green got so frustrated he blurted an expletive during a recent news\nconference.\n\n\u201cThis fire uncovered a clear truth, which is we have too many short-term\nrentals owned by too many individuals on the mainland and it is b\u2014\u2014\u2014t,\u201d Green\nsaid. \u201cAnd our people deserve housing, here.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFILE - Signs asking people to respect locals and that \"Lahaina is not for\nsale\" are seen on the side of the Lahaina Bypass, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023, in\nLahaina, Hawaii. An acute housing shortage hitting fire survivors on the\nHawaiian island of Maui is squeezing out residents even as they try to\novercome the loss of loved ones, their homes and their community. (AP\nPhoto/Lindsey Wasson, File)\n\nVacation rentals are a popular alternative to hotels for those seeking\nkitchens, lower costs and opportunities to sample everyday island life.\nSupporters say they boost tourism, the state\u2019s biggest employer. Critics\nrevile them for inflating housing costs, upending neighborhoods and\ncontributing to the forces pushing locals and Native Hawaiians to leave Hawaii\nfor less expensive states.\n\nThis migration has become a major concern in Lahaina. The Council for Native\nHawaiian Advancement, a nonprofit, estimates at least 1,500 households \u2014 or a\nquarter of those who lost their homes \u2014 have left since the August wildfire.\n\nThe blaze burned single family homes and apartments in and around downtown,\nwhich is the core of Lahaina\u2019s residential housing. An analysis by the\nUniversity of Hawaii Economic Research Organization found a relatively low\n7.5% of units there were vacation rentals as of February 2023.\n\nLahaina neighborhoods spared by the fire have a much higher ratio of vacation\nrentals: About half the housing in Napili, about 7 miles north of the burn\nzone, is short-term rentals.\n\nNapili is where Chadwick thought she found a place to buy when she first went\nhouse hunting in 2016. But a Canadian woman secured it with a cash offer and\nturned it into a vacation rental.\n\nAmy Chadwick, stands by map of Hawaii at her current home Monday, April 8,\n2024, in Satellite Beach, Fla. Chadwick, a victim of the fires in Hawaii moved\nto Florida where she could stretch her homeowners insurance dollars while she\nwaits for her lot to be cleared and for permission to rebuild. (AP Photo/John\nRaoux)\n\nAlso outside the burn zone are dozens of short-term rental condominium\nbuildings erected decades ago on land zoned for apartments.\n\nIn 1992, Maui County explicitly allowed owners in these buildings to rent\nunits for less than 180 days at a time even without short-term rental permits.\nSince November, activists have occupied the beach in front of Lahaina\u2019s\nbiggest hotels to push the mayor or governor to use their emergency powers to\nrevoke this exemption.\n\nMoney is a powerful incentive for owners to rent to travelers: a 2016 report\nprepared for the state found a Honolulu vacation rental generates 3.5 times\nthe revenue of a long-term rental.\n\nState Rep. Luke Evslin, the Housing Committee chair, said Maui and Kauai\ncounties have suffered net losses of residential housing in recent years\nthanks to a paucity of new construction and the conversion of so many homes to\nshort-term rentals.\n\n\u201cEvery alarm bell we have should be ringing when we\u2019re literally going\nbackwards in our goal to provide more housing in Hawaii,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his own Kauai district, Evslin sees people leaving, becoming homeless or\nworking three jobs to stay afloat.\n\nThe Democrat was one of 47 House members who co-sponsored one version of\nlegislation that would allow short-term rentals to be phased out. One\nobjective is to give counties more power after a U.S. judge in 2022 ruled\nHonolulu violated state law when it attempted to prohibit rentals for less\nthan 90 days. Evslin said that decision left Hawaii\u2019s counties with limited\ntools, such as property taxes, to control vacation rentals.\n\nLawmakers also considered trying to boost Hawaii\u2019s housing supply by forcing\ncounties to allow more houses to be built on individual lots. But they watered\ndown the measure after local officials said they were already exploring the\nidea.\n\nShort-term rental owners said a phase-out would violate their property rights\nand take their property without compensation, potentially pushing them into\nforeclosure. Some predicted legal challenges.\n\nAlicia Humiston, president of the Rentals by Owner Awareness Association, said\nsome areas in West Maui were designed for travelers and therefore lack schools\nand other infrastructure families need.\n\n\u201cThis area in West Maui that is sort of like this resort apartment zone \u2014\nthat\u2019s all north of Lahaina \u2014 it was never built to be local living,\u201d Humiston\nsaid.\n\nOne housing advocate argues that just because a community allowed vacation\nrentals decades ago doesn\u2019t mean it still needs to now.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are not living in the 1990s or in the 1970s,\u201d said Sterling Higa,\nexecutive director of Housing Hawaii\u2019s Future. Counties \u201cshould have the\nauthority to look at existing laws and reform them as necessary to provide for\nthe public good.\u201d\n\nCourtney Lazo, a real estate agent who is part of Lahaina Strong, the group\noccupying Kaanapali Beach, said tourists can stay in her hometown now but many\nlocals can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHow do you expect a community to recover and heal and move forward when the\npeople who make Lahaina, Lahaina, aren\u2019t even there anymore?\u201d she said at a\nrecent news conference as her voice quivered. \u201cThey\u2019re moving away.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n### Around The Web\n\n## Most read by subscribers\n\n1\n\n### Supreme Court appears divided over homeless ban and rights of the unhoused\n\n2\n\n### Rooftop solar panels are flooding California\u2019s grid.
