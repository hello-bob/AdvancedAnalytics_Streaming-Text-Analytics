But it can be slow\nto beam huge amounts of data across the solar system \u2013 for example, it took\nNew Horizons 15 months to send the 50 GB of data from its close encounter with\nPluto back to Earth.\n\nMore Stories\n\nEnergy\n\nSea-bed 'air batteries' offer cheaper long-term energy storage\n\nBiology\n\nWould we exist if Earth's magnetic field hadn't collapsed 500m years ago?\n\nUsing light could drastically speed up that process, at least in some cases.\nData can be encoded more densely into light waves than radio waves, allowing\nlarger packets to be sent in a shorter time. So far, high speed tests have\nbeamed data in lasers between satellites and the ground, and even from lunar\norbit to Earth, but things get trickier over longer distances.\n\nNow, NASA has broken the distance record for data transmission via lasers. On\nApril 8, the Psyche spacecraft, currently en route to the asteroid belt,\nbeamed data back to Earth from over 140 million miles (225 million km) away.\nThat\u2019s about one and a half times the distance to the Sun, and 14 times\nfarther than the first test of the equipment back in November.\n\nA diagram illustrating the distance record achieved in the new laser\ncommunication test, between Earth and the spacecraft Psyche\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe goal was to prove that the spacecraft could transmit at up to 1 Megabit\nper second (Mbps), but that was far surpassed, with the test clocking speeds\nof up to 25 Mbps. The Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) instrument\nonboard Psyche sent a copy of engineering data to Palomar Observatory in\nCalifornia, while simultaneously sending the same data to NASA\u2019s Deep Space\nNetwork via radio.\n\nFor context, Netflix recommends 25 Mbps to stream the service in 4K.\n\n\u201cWe downlinked about 10 minutes of duplicated spacecraft data during a pass on\nApril 8,\u201d said Meera Srinivasan, operations lead on the project. \u201cUntil then,\nwe\u2019d been sending test and diagnostic data in our downlinks from Psyche. This\nrepresents a significant milestone for the project by showing how optical\ncommunications can interface with a spacecraft\u2019s radio frequency comms\nsystem.\u201d\n\nOther recent experiments include sending data from ground stations to Psyche\nand back \u2013 a round trip of 280 million miles (450 million km) \u2013 in a single\nnight, and using multiple receivers in different regions to pick up the signal\nat the same time, which could be important if weather conditions in one area\ninterrupt the connection.\n\nThe team says this tech demo is a key step towards faster communication of\nhigh resolution images and data that will be needed when humans eventually set\nfoot on Mars.\n\nSource: NASA\n\n## Tags\n\nSpaceNASACommunicationsCommunicateLaserLightDataTransmissionPsycheSpacecraftOptical\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\nNo comments\n\nMichael Irving\n\nMichael has always been fascinated by space, technology, dinosaurs, and the\nweirder mysteries of the universe.
