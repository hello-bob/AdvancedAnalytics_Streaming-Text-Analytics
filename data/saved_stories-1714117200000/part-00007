Twenty-plus years later, that complaint no longer\nholds water.\n\nLinux has several viable routes to installing tons of applications. There's\nevery distribution's built-in package manager, such as apt (Debian-based), dnf\n(Fedora-based), zypper (SUSE-based), and pacman (Arch-based). There are also\nuniversal package managers (Snap and Flatpak packages) and you can also\ninstall them from the source.\n\nAlso: There's a new Ubuntu Linux desktop on its way\n\nAnother method for installing apps is called AppImage. It's a unique format\nfor distributing Linux applications. Apps don't depend on any specific\ndistribution or desktop environment, require installation, and can be run\nwithout admin privileges. In other words, you download the AppImage for an\napplication and run it. That's it.\n\nWell, sort of -- as there's another step to take before you can run the\napplication, which is part of what I want to talk about. But first, let's find\nout more about AppImages.\n\n#### Newsletters\n\nZDNET Tech Today\n\nZDNET's Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked\nabout stories, five days a week.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSee all\n\n## Why use AppImages?\n\nThis is the big question. Even after using AppImages for quite some time, the\nmain answer I have to the question is that, in some cases, there isn't an\nalternative. There are some applications I've used over the years that only\noffer an AppImage option. With AppImages, the app should run exactly as\nexpected, regardless of what desktop environment, window manager, or\ndistribution is used. This consistency is a big plus for developers who\ndeliver their products quickly and reliably.\n\nAlso: 8 cool things you can do with a Linux desktop\n\nThe primary goals for AppImages are simplicity, binary compatibility,\ndistribution agnosticism, zero installation, zero-root permission required,\nand portability. These goals are all achieved while leaving the operating\nsystem untouched.\n\nSounds like a perfect system, right? For the most part, AppImages is quite\ngood, but there are downsides. For example, you cannot upgrade an AppImage.\nInstead, you download a new image and run it instead of the old one, hoping\nall your configurations and data aren't lost. The other downfall is that users\noften have to manage the executable permission for the AppImage. Although\nsetting that permission is quite simple, it is another step.\n\nAlso: How to install software on Linux using Snap (and why you should)\n\nNow that you understand AppImages, let's see how they are used in Linux. I'm\ngoing to show you by way of the Bitwarden AppImage.\n\n## How to use an AppImage on Linux\n\nWhat you'll need: The only thing you'll need for this task is a running\ninstance of a Linux distribution. It doesn't matter what distribution, only\nthat it has a GUI. That's it. Let's get this AppImage running.\n\n## 1: Download the AppImage file\n\nOpen your web browser and point it to the Bitwarden download page. Once there,\nclick the Linux entry and save the .AppImage file to your Downloads directory.\n\n## 2: Give the AppImage the necessary permissions\n\nOpen your desktop file manager (such as GNOME Files) and locate the\nPermissions section. In GNOME Files, there's a Permissions tab. Click that tab\nand then click the checkbox for Allow Executing File As Program.\n\nAlso: The best Linux distros for beginners: You can do this!\n\nOnce you've enabled execution permission, close the Properties window and go\nback to the file manager.\n\nYou must give an AppImage executable permission before it can run.\n\nScreenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nAnother way of giving the file execution permission is from the command line.\nThis route is not quite as easy, but it's also not hard.\n\nAlso: How to add the power of DuckDuckGo to your Linux terminal\n\nTo give the file execution permission from the command line, open a terminal\nwindow and change into the Downloads directory using the command:\n\n    \n    \n    cd ~/Downloads\n\nNext, give the file execution permissions with the command:\n\n    \n    \n    chmod u+x Bitwarden*.AppImage\n\n## 3\\. How to run an AppImage on Linux\n\nNow that you've set the permissions, all you have to do to run the AppImage is\nopen the file manager, navigate to the directory for the application, and\ndouble-click on the AppImage file. This will open the app and you can use it\nas you would any application installed on the desktop.\n\nAlso: Ubuntu Mate is one of the most popular Ubuntu spins for a reason\n\nThe one caveat to running AppImages on your desktop is they often do not have\nthe means to integrate with your desktop menu, docks, or panels. As a result,\neither you have to launch the application from the file manager or some\ndesktop environments will allow you to create a desktop file first (which is\nbeyond the scope of this article).\n\nSome AppImages, such as the one for Bitwarden, offer a desktop integrations\noption that creates a launcher for your menu. If you see an integration option\non the first launch of the application, make sure to go ahead with that\nconfiguration to simplify things.\n\nAnd that's all there is to using an AppImage on Linux. It's a viable option\nfor anyone looking to run applications on Linux not found within the built-in\npackage manager.\n\n#### Linux\n\nThe best Linux laptops for consumers and developers\n\nWant to save your aging computer?
