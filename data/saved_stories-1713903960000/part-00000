We started just over four years ago with a vision to remake\nconsumer electronics to respect people and the planet. We chose to take on the\nnotebook space first to prove that it\u2019s possible to fix even the most mature,\ncompetitive categories with an excellent product that is simple to repair,\nupgrade, and customize. We\u2019ve continued to increase our sales and market share\nsubstantially each year as the industry broadly has struggled. It\u2019s clear that\nour commitment to longevity is resonating. It\u2019s ultimately your belief in our\nmission and products that drives our success.\n\nWhen we closed a Series A round two years ago, we shared our strategy around\nfundraising, which is to raise as little as possible and focus funds on\nefficiently expanding the reach of our mission. You can now see the results of\nthat investment with Framework Laptop 16 out in customers\u2019 hands. With this\nnew round, we\u2019re continuing to deepen support for our existing customers,\nscaling the reach of our current products, and extending to additional product\ncategories that let us empower new consumers and businesses. Ultimately, we\nneed for everyone in the world to have the option for a longer-lasting\nproduct, no matter the category.\n\nA core focus of this fundraise beyond taking in capital is bringing strategic\nconnections and expertise. We chose each of our new investors based on their\nbelief in our mission, the strengths of their teams, the companies they work\nwith, and the reach of their networks. We\u2019ve had a number of early partnership\ndiscussions with other startups in our investors\u2019 portfolios, and we\u2019re\nexcited to share more about this as we deliver on the results. Cooler Master\nis a key strategic partner-turned-investor, having been both the supplier for\nour Framework Laptop 16 thermal system and the first company to join the\nFramework ecosystem with a compatible product, a case that enables Framework\nLaptop Mainboard reuse. We have additional collaborations with the Cooler\nMaster team in incubation now.\n\nThere is one group of people who are more strategically important than any\nother: the Framework community. The third most common question we\u2019ve gotten\nsince starting Framework (after \u201cAMD when?\u201d and \u201cUpgradeable graphics when?\u201d)\nis \u201cCan I invest in Framework?\u201d. The answer is finally... possibly. In\naddition to the $17M of funds we\u2019ve raised from traditional investors, we\u2019re\nraising a $1M community round to enable 100 of you to invest $10,000 each in\nFramework. Investing in startups is approximately the riskiest place\nimaginable to put your money, and statistically, the most likely outcome for\nany individual early-stage startup investment is for it to become worthless.\nWith that in mind, for both moral and regulatory reasons, we\u2019re limiting\nparticipation to individuals and entities that meet the SEC\u2019s Accredited\nInvestor qualifications. This also allows us to publicly share the existence\nof this fundraising under the SEC\u2019s 506(c) regulations. If you qualify as an\nAccredited Investor, believe in our mission and strategy, and are interested\nin investing in this round, you can get more details and apply here.\n\nThere\u2019s one other way you can participate in our mission, which is to join our\nteam! To actually drive the growth that our new funding enables, we\u2019re adding\na few key roles across Framework, including a Product Marketing Manager and a\nSupply Chain Manager. You can check out all of our open roles on our careers\npage. We\u2019re eager to fix this industry together as quickly as we can.\n\n## Which Framework Laptop is right for you?\n\nBrowse Framework Laptops\n\n  * Company\n  * About Us\n  * Sustainability\n  * Our Blog\n  * We're Hiring 7\n  * Contact Us\n  * Framework for Business\n\n  * Social\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Discord\n  * Mastodon\n  * GitHub\n  * RSS\n\n  * Community\n  * Community Forum\n  * Support\n  * Repair Guides\n\n  * Marketplace\n  * View All\n  * Framework Laptop\n  * Expansion Cards\n  * Mainboards\n  * Memory & Storage\n  * Keyboards\n  * Parts\n  * Customization\n  * Tools\n  * Software\n  * Merch\n\nSubscribe\n\nStay up to date with the Framework Newsletter (a few times a month)\n\n\u00a9 2024 Framework Computer Inc\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWarranty\n\nTerms of Sale\n\nCookie Policy\n\nUSD\n\nUSD\n\n", "frontpage": true}
