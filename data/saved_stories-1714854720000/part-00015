At this point, we have to have it,\" Mr\nKendall said after he climbed grinning from the cockpit.\n\nImage: Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall was in the cockpit.

Arms control experts and humanitarian groups are\nconcerned that AI might one day be able to autonomously drop bombs without\nfurther human consultation and are seeking restrictions on its use.\n\nRead more: Meta's AI tells Facebook user it has a child Creating fake sexual\nimages to become criminal offence\n\n\"There are widespread and serious concerns about ceding life-and-death\ndecisions to sensors and software,\" the International Committee of the Red\nCross has warned.\n\nMr Kendall said there would always be human oversight when weapons are used.\n\nThe pilots programming Vista are aware they are potentially training their own\nreplacements, but would also dread going up against an enemy's AI fleet\nthemselves.\n\n\"We have to keep running. And we have to run fast,\" Mr Kendall said.\n\n### Related Topics\n\n  * Artificial Intelligence\n\n## Sky News footer\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n\n### About Sky News\n\n  * About Us\n  * Sky News Profiles\n  * Sky News International\n  * Sky News Library Sales\n  * Site Map\n  * Editorial Guidelines\n  * Sky News Board\n\n### Sky News Services\n\n  * Sky News RSS\n  * Sky News For Your Phone\n  * Sky News Radio\n\n### Sky Channels\n\n  * Sky Witness\n  * Sky Atlantic\n  * Sky Arts\n  * Sky Cinema\n  * Sky Sports\n\n### More Sky Sites\n\n  * NOW\n  * Sky Zero\n  * Sky Academy Studios\n  * Bigger Picture\n  * Sky Group\n  * Sky Bet\n  * Sky.com\n  * Sky News Arabia\n  * Advertise With Us\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy & Cookies\n  * Privacy Options\n  * Accessibility\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sky UK\n\n", "frontpage": false}
