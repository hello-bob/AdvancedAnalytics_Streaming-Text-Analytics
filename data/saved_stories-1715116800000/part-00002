The\ncomplexity class includes all problems solvable in polynomial time by a\nquantum computer. Prime factorization is in class, and is also in class, owing\nto Shor's algorithm. The hardest of all problems within the class are called\n-complete. If a quantum algorithm can solve an -complete problem in polynomial\ntime, it would imply that a quantum computer can solve all problems in in\npolynomial time. Here, we present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm to solve\nan -complete variant of the problem, thereby, rendering . We illustrate that\ngiven a set of integers, which may be positive or negative, a quantum computer\ncan decide in polynomial time whether there exists any subset that sums to\nzero. There are many real-world applications of our result, such as finding\npatterns efficiently in stock-market data, or in recordings of the weather or\nbrain activity. As an example, the decision problem of matching two images in\nimage processing is -complete, and can be solved in polynomial time, when\namplitude amplification is not required.\n\nNote: Preprint, 6 pages, 2 figures, comments welcome.\n\n##### Metadata\n\nAvailable format(s)\n\n    PDF\nCategory\n\n    Foundations\nPublication info\n\n    Preprint.\nKeywords\n\n    Subset-Sum ProblemNP-complete ProblemBQP AlgorithmQuantum AlgorithmExponential Speedup\nContact author(s)\n\n    sanchita ghosh14 @ gmail com anantsharma2410 @ gmail com sreetama das @ ino cnr it roy shibdas @ gmail com\nHistory\n\n    2024-04-29: approved\n    2024-04-27: received\n    See all versions\nShort URL\n\n    https://ia.cr/2024/646\nLicense\n\n    CC BY\n\nBibTeX\n\n    \n    \n    @misc{cryptoeprint:2024/646, author = {Sanchita Ghosh and Anant Sharma and Sreetama Das and Shibdas Roy}, title = {Efficient Quantum Algorithm for SUBSET-SUM Problem}, howpublished = {Cryptology ePrint Archive, Paper 2024/646}, year = {2024}, note = {\\url{https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/646}}, url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/646} }\n\nNote: In order to protect the privacy of readers, eprint.iacr.org does not use\ncookies or embedded third party content.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
