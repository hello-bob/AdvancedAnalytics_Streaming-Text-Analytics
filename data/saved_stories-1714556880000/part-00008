It takes a\nhighly opinionated approach to using container technology by deploying fat\ncontainers as isolated server appliances.\n\nOf course it's open source.\n\n#### Preface\n\nAfter conducting a survey, we discovered a much larger number of people wish\nto self-host than the current self-hosting base today.\n\nThrough a series of person-to-person interviews, we established two cohorts -\nthe \"too hard to setup\" and \"don't have IP addresses\" groups.\n\nIPv6rs is the answer to the latter, but the former left us curious.\n\n#### Self-Hostathon\n\nWe proceeded to conduct a self-hostathon of sorts. Our participants ranged in\nexpertise - with some having worked as computer repair specialists and others\nwith web development experience. There were also musicians and many other\nprofessional backgrounds not so directly related to the computer world. While\nall of the participants were able to setup their IPv6rs and DNS, few were able\nto completely setup a self-hosted server (in this case, the options were\nWordpress, Ghost or Mastodon).\n\nWe reviewed the actions taken by interviewing the partipants, individually,\nand found peculiar, yet understandable, errors abound; from typos to\nsituations where the VM needed to be wiped.\n\n#### The State of Server and Open Source Server Type Software Projects\n\nIt was surprising to us as we figured the install process was much simpler.\nWhen we look at the open source server softwares out there, they look amazing\n-- well polished, complete enterprise worthy software applications used by the\nmost popular websites in the world, and built, free and open source, by kind\nand beautiful contributors.\n\nHowever, the multi-faceted, multi step and manual setup process proves to be a\nsignificant obstacle.\n\n## Our Solution: Cloud Seeder by IPv6rs\n\nSince we already solve the external IP issue with our service, we decided to\nsolve the setup issue. We'd like to introduce you to Cloud Seeder by IPv6rs\nwhich provides a simple graphical user interface to setup appliances with just\na click.\n\nCloud Seeder by IPv6rs was built using GoLang with its GUI powered by Fyne,\nwhich helps us to enable cross platform compatibility with a single, slim and\ndescriptively readable, codebase. Under the hood, it relies on the amazing\nPodman, which of course is open source.\n\nNow, with one-click, you can have your software server appliance running from\nyour own home computer in it's own encapsulated container.\n\nThe friction with self hosting is gone.\n\nThe decentralized era of self ownership is here.\n\nOwn your own data, and be happy. After all, trust is not security; everytime\nyou trust an entity with your data, you increase your attack surface area by\nthe size of that entity.\n\n#### Current Supported Appliances\n\nThere will be many more appliances supported in the future. The current list\nis below:\n\n  * Mastodon\n\n  * OpenWeb-UI powered by Ollama\n\n  * Nextcloud\n\n  * code-server\n\n  * Wordpress\n\n  * Ghost\n\n  * Misskey\n\n  * Lemmy\n\n  * Pixelfed\n\n  * RocketChat\n\n  * Vaultwarden\n\n  * Bluesky\n\n  * Mail Server by PostFix and Dovecot\n\n  * Stalwart\n\n  * Jellyfin\n\n  * PeerTube\n\n  * Immich\n\n  * Planka\n\n  * XMPP\n\n  * YaCy\n\n  * Gitea\n\n  * Gitlab\n\n  * Minecraft\n\n  * Funkwhale\n\n  * Navidrome\n\n  * LAMP Server\n\n  * Base Ubuntu 22.04\n\n#### Current Supported Architectures\n\nCloud Seeders by IPv6rs will instantly setup a server appliance for you on:\n\n  * MacOS (x86 or ARM)\n  * Windows 10, 11 (x86 only)\n  * Linux (gnome-terminal required) (x86 or ARM)\n\nPodman must be installed first.\n\n### How to Install\n\nIt's best to download the binaries from our Releases page. These follow the\ntypical install scheme for each OS (installer for windows, dmg for MacOS and a\nfolder for Linux)\n\nIf you'd like to compile yourself, you'll need Golang 1.21.0+ and then follow\nthese instructions:\n\n    \n    \n    cd cloudseeder cd src && go mod tidy make\n\nThe unsigned binaries should be in a folder called cloudseeder/dist upon\ncompletion.\n\nAll of this has only been tested on MacOS but the build should work fine in\nLinux.\n\n### Core Details\n\n  * simple, completely non-interactive installs\n\n  * unattended security updates enabled by default for security\n\n  * using battle hardened and stable ubuntu 22.04 LTS for security and compatibility\n\n  * automated updates provided via tray menu\n\n  * sshd disabled by default for security\n\n  * syslog disabled by default for storage\n\n  * CAP_NET_ADMIN, /dev/net/tun ro access to cgroups are the only permissions required [1][2]\n\n[1] SELinux is disabled.\n\n[2] With the exception, as of writing, of bluesky which requires privileged\naccess. Only run if you trust bluesky!\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n##### Why Open Source?\n\nAll of the appliances we support are open source, so of course we're open\nsource too. Further, you need to know what you are installing and what that\ninstalled software is doing for that matter -- our transparency in this\nprocess is our way of showing you our commitment to you.\n\n##### Why did you use Go and not Electron?\n\nWe chose GoLang as the programming language to benefit from its cross-platform\nability as well as small binary form factor versus, for example, nodeJS.\n\nAdditionally, we built a Configurator which automatically generates a user-\ninterface from a JSON file to run a script. We felt this would be useful to\nother developers, so this has been separated as its own module which you can\nbuild and distribute with your own application subject to the open source\nlicense. This will improve over time.\n\nWe also built Tray which generates a task tray from a JSON file. You can feel\nfree to use it in your projects.\n\n##### Why a fat container? Why not VM?\n\nWe initially built Cloud Seeder by IPv6rs as a VM launcher -- powered by\nMultipass. We made the pivot after researching extensive CVEs and other\ncontainer escapes and cross referenced against those relating to QEMU and\nvirtualization/hypervisors, generally. It is not 2016 anymore. Containers have\ncome a long way.\n\nThe biggest benefit is not needing to reserve RAM and CPU for each individual\nappliance allowing you to deploy several appliances versus a few.\n\nWe run the containers with NET_ADMIN and read-only access to cgroups. The\nassumption is that you're not running untrusted appliances, but if you are,\nthey still need to escape the container in a meaningful way.\n\nThe exception is the appliances that run privileged for Cinch (Container IN\nContainer Hierarchy).\n\n##### How do I get the syslog?\n\nType journalctl or to get the end of the file, journalctl -e or tail with\njournactl -f\n\n##### Can I install other stuff on my appliance?\n\nYou can, but we don't recommend it. When we release updates/upgrades these\nchanges may conflict. Instead, launch another container or recommend an\nappliance to us if we don't have a package for it already!\n\n##### When will more appliances come?\n\nWe are always working on more and they should arrive soon! :-)\n\n##### How do we donate? This is great for decentralization and the self-\nhosting movement.\n\nPlease donate to the respective projects! These are awesome platforms built by\ngreat people who deserve these funds.\n\nAnd when you're looking for an external IP, definitely give IPv6rs (us) a\nlook.\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 IPv6rs Limited https://ipv6.rs\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCOOLER License.\n\n## About\n\nOne-click install internet appliances that operate on your terms.
