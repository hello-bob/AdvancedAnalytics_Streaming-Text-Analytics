Published\nAugust 10, 2022.\n\n### Lecture 1: Course Vision and When to Use ML\n\nWe review the purpose of the course and consider when it's a good (or bad!)\nidea to use ML. Published August 8, 2022.\n\n### Lab Overview\n\nWe walk through the entire architecture of the application we will be\nbuilding, from soup to nuts. Published July 25, 2022.\n\n### Lecture 2: Development Infrastructure & Tooling\n\nWe tour the landscape of infrastructure and tooling for developing deep\nlearning models. Published August 15, 2022.\n\n### Lab 4: Experiment Management\n\nWe run, track, and manage model development experiments with Weights & Biases.\nPublished August 17, 2022.\n\n### Lecture 3: Troubleshooting & Testing\n\nWe look at tools and practices for testing software in general and ML models\nin particular. Published August 22, 2022.\n\n### Lab 5: Troubleshooting & Testing\n\nWe try out some Python testing tools and dissect a PyTorch trace to learn\nperformance troubleshooting techniques. Published August 24, 2022.\n\n### Lecture 4: Data Management\n\nWe look at sourcing, storing, exploring, processing, labeling, and versioning\ndata for deep learning. Published August 29, 2022.\n\n### Lab 6: Data Annotation\n\nWe spin up a data annotation server and learn just how messy data really is.\nPublished August 31, 2022.\n\n### Lecture 5: Data Management\n\nWe do a lightning tour of all the ways models are deployed and do a deep dive\non running models as web services. Published September 5, 2022.\n\n### Lab 7: Web Deployment\n\nWe create and deploy our ML-powered text recognition application with a simple\nweb UI and a serverless model service. Published September 7, 2022.\n\n### Lecture 6: Continual Learning\n\nWe consider what it takes to build a continual learning system around an ML-\npowered application. Published September 12, 2022.\n\n### Lab 8: Model Monitoring\n\nWe add user feedback to our ML application and review data logged by actual\nusers of the FSDL Text Recognizer. Published September 14, 2022.\n\n### Lecture 7: Foundation Models\n\nWe look at how to build on GPT-3, CLIP, StableDiffusion, and other large\nmodels. Published September 19, 2022.\n\n### Lecture 8: ML Teams and Project Management\n\nWe look at the structure of ML teams and projects, including how to hire or\nget hired on an ML team and how to build an ML-first organization. Published\nSeptember 26, 2022.\n\n### Lecture 9: Ethics\n\nWe consider ethical concerns around buiding technlogy, building with machine\nlearning, and building artificial intelligence.
