As a result, Facepunch Studios, the developers of Garry\u2019s Mod, are\nin the process of removing about 20 years\u2019 worth of Nintendo-related content\nfrom the game.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nTurok 3 and Star Wars: Dark Forces Are Getting Remastered\n\nNew Retro Shooter Mashes Duke Nukem And Half-Life Together\n\nWhy The Hot New Redfall Gameplay Trailer Left Us Feeling Cold\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nWhy The Hot New Redfall Gameplay Trailer Left Us Feeling Cold\n\nIn an update to Garry\u2019s Mod\u2019s Steam page, the developers stated, \u201cSome of you\nmay have noticed that certain Nintendo related workshop items have recently\nbeen taken down. This is not a mistake, the takedowns came from Nintendo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nTurok 3 and Star Wars: Dark Forces Are Getting Remastered\n\nNew Retro Shooter Mashes Duke Nukem And Half-Life Together\n\nWhy The Hot New Redfall Gameplay Trailer Left Us Feeling Cold\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nWhy The Hot New Redfall Gameplay Trailer Left Us Feeling Cold\n\nThe update continues, \u201cHonestly, this is fair enough. This is Nintendo\u2019s\ncontent and what they allow and don\u2019t allow is up to them. They don\u2019t want you\nplaying with that stuff in Garry\u2019s Mod - that\u2019s their decision, we have to\nrespect that and take down as much as we can.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Nintendo\u2019s litigious nature, not to mention its fierce protectiveness\nover its brand image and that of its mascots, the notice from Nintendo comes\nas a bit of a shock. As the update goes on to note, Nintendo content has been\nhosted on Garry\u2019s Mod for close to 20 years. Models of countless Nintendo\nmascots like Mario have been ported over to the Source engine for the\nenjoyment of anyone playing Garry\u2019s Mod since the very beginning. It\u2019s strange\nfor Nintendo to suddenly come out of the blue and enforce a takedown of this\nmuch content, especially since the flexibility of the Source engine in Garry\u2019s\nMod was a large part of the appeal behind the game, which was popularized in\nthe early 2010s by a slew of gaming Youtube personalities playing multiplayer\nsocial-deduction games in Garry\u2019s Mod such as Prop Hunt and Trouble In\nTerrorist Town. Of course, you could also argue that Facepunch was, at times,\na little too lenient about what they allowed on Garry\u2019s Mod, making sense of\nNintendo\u2019s decision to take action after all this time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNintendo-themed add-ons seem to have begun getting taken down a few months\nago, though Facepunch didn\u2019t publicly divulge that the company had issued the\ntakedowns until earlier today. The process has been \u201congoing\u201d since then, and\nthe developers are still working to remove all of it, which is an\nunderstandably Herculean task.\n\nIt\u2019s so much, in fact, that at the very end of the update, Facepunch jokes\nthat, \u201cIf you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo related uploads and\nnever uploading them again, that would help us a lot.\u201d\n\n", "frontpage": false}
