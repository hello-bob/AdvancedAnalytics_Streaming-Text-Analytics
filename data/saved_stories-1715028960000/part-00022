Tenure is the length of\ntime in job. Their correlation degrades rapidly.\n\nTenure is the length of time with an employer or the industry. Aptitude is\ncompetence and the ability to perform a certain kind of work at a certain\nlevel. Aptitude is acquired through experience (XP), which requires tenure,\nbut the correlation degrades rapidly as tenure grows.\n\nEarly on in the career, acquiring aptitude is easy because the skill tree is\nsimple and has well-trodden paths; tenure and aptitude have a reasonably high\ncorrelation, and there is an expectation of progress across aptitude levels\nwithin specific time frames. As you progress in your career, tenure and\naptitude start to diverge and begin to fluctuate wildly:\n\n  * You can have five years of tenure repeating the same year of XP: the skill tree is not changing much.\n  * You can steadily accumulate XP points, year after year, and gradually unlock new branches of the skill tree.\n  * You can have a year of tenure that accumulates five years of XP in one: a speedrun through the skill tree.\n\nThere are no constants. Most of us will experience alternating periods of\nsteady growth, professional plateaus, and speedruns: some will continuously\nseek out pressure-cooker assignments, some will be thrust into them, and\nothers will settle into a comfortable groove where they will hone their\nestablished craft and skill tree.\n\nDifferent people have different optimal \u201cresting aptitude level\u201d. While there\nis an expectation of progress at the beginning of the journey\u2014the ascent to\nthe \u201cbasecamp aptitude skill tree\u201d\u2014most of us will eventually settle at a\nplateau. This is not a bug, or a deficiency of the individual, it\u2019s normal and\nexpected.\n\n### Find your \"resting\" zone before you lose it\n\nMost organizations have a \u201ccareer resting level\u201d for each job: a level\neveryone is expected to reach eventually that, once reached, carries no\nfurther level growth expectations except for sustained execution and honing of\ntheir craft. Unfortunately, it's rare to find well-developed tools and\nlanguage that gives enough credit, praise, and recognition to this happy\nsteady state. Resting levels are not \"easy\" levels, they are the personal\ngoldilocks zone: challenging but not impossible, rewarding but not at the cost\nof all else.\n\nA clear-eyed perspective for the \"right\" resting level is one of the most\nchallenging personal questions. The answer is not static and may shift based\non variety of circumstances\u2014health, family, organization that you're operating\nin, and access to opportunities\u2014and all too often leads most of us into the\ntrap of Peter's principle: we only recognize the optimal zone once we lost it,\nfeeling trapped and unable to step back. It\u2019s not atypical to find many high-\nflying icons\u2014regardless of whether they are IC's or managers, founders or\nemployees\u2014wistfully lamenting about a happier and more satisfying professional\nstage in their career.\n\nNone of the above is an argument for not pushing yourself, or others, beyond\nan expected career resting level. On the contrary, lean into it, but make sure\nyou do it with a clear understanding that transitions beyond a certain level\ncome with increasingly large and transformational shape-shifting of both the\nscope and type of work involved. Tenure is not aptitude. Build the right\nskills but know what kind of skills and work will make you happy.\n\n  * Share on Twitter\n\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n\n  * Share via Email\n\n  * Copy link\n\n###\n\nIlya Grigorik\n\nTwitter\n\nPrincipal Engineer, Technical Advisor to the CEO at Shopify.
