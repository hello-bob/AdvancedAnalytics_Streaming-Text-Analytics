(U.S. Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich)\n\nUPDATED 4/24/24 at 5:48 PM ET with details from an Air Force press release and\ncomments from CCA vendors.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Defense startup Anduril and drone maker General Atomics\nAeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) have been picked by the Air Force to build and\ntest drone prototypes for the next phase of the service\u2019s Collaborative Combat\nAircraft program, the Air Force announced tonight.\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s decision winnows down a pool of five competitors to two. As a\nresult, three other vendors \u2014 Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman \u2014\nhave been eliminated from the running.\n\n\u201cThe companies not selected to build these production representative CCA\nvehicles, and execute the flight test program, will continue to be part of the\nbroader industry partner vendor pool consisting of more than 20 companies to\ncompete for future efforts, including future production contracts,\u201d the Air\nForce said.\n\nAs Breaking Defense first reported, the five contractors were previously\npicked by the Air Force for the program\u2019s first phase, which largely focused\non design work. Today\u2019s selection narrows down the vendors who will take their\ndesigns from the drawing board to the real world. As Air Force acquisition\nchief Andrew Hunter recently told lawmakers in a congressional hearing, the\nupcoming CCA stage will see those vendors \u201ccomplete detailed designs, build\nprototypes and test production-representative test articles.\u201d\n\nUnveiled by the service as a major multibillion dollar program in the fiscal\nyear 2024 budget, the CCA effort aims to initially field as many as 1,000\ndrones. According to the service\u2019s press release today, officials plan to make\na \u201ccompetitive production decision\u201d by FY26 for the first round of CCA work\nand \u201cfield a fully operational capability before the end of the decade.\u201d\n\nAir Warfare, Sponsored\n\n### GA-ASI\u2019s MQ-9B: The right UAV for persistence, power, and performance\n\nAir Warfare, Sponsored\n\n### GA-ASI\u2019s MQ-9B: The right UAV for persistence, power, and performance\n\nAir Warfare, Sponsored\n\n### GA-ASI\u2019s MQ-9B: The right UAV for persistence, power, and performance\n\nWhen assessing the state of the art of unmanned aerial systems, it\u2019s critical\nto be very clear about what various aircraft can and can\u2019t do \u2013 and could\nnever do.\n\nFrom GENERAL ATOMICS AERONAUTICAL SYSTEMS, INC.\n\nWhen assessing the state of the art of unmanned aerial systems, it\u2019s critical\nto be very clear about what various aircraft can and can\u2019t do \u2013 and could\nnever do.\n\nFrom GENERAL ATOMICS AERONAUTICAL SYSTEMS, INC.\n\nRELATED: In a \u2018world first,\u2019 DARPA project demonstrates AI dogfighting in a\nreal jet\n\nAt the Air & Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium in February, Kendall\nrevealed that the CCA competition underway right now would be the program\u2019s\nfirst \u201cincrement,\u201d with a second to follow in the FY25 budget. That second\nincrement would provide vendors eliminated today, as well as new ones, another\nshot at a CCA contract. International collaboration could also feature in the\nsecond increment, Kendall said, and the service\u2019s release today indicated\nforeign military sales could be on the table for the program.\n\nDuring the February roundtable, Kendall further revealed the \u201cpossibility\u201d\nthat more than one vendor could see their drone bid enter service for the\nfirst increment. He also floated the chance of carrying up to three vendors\nthrough the preceding test phase if industry helped share some of the cost.\n\nRecommended\n\n### Clearing smoke: Boeing swapping out AH-64E Apache generators, eyes new\ngenerator options\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some improvement ... and so readiness is there: We have enough\nretrofit generators right now [and] it\u2019s not impacting readiness,\u201d said John\nChicoli, the director of Boeing\u2019s global services for vertical lift and\nspecial operations.\n\nBy Ashley Roque\n\nWith only two vendors making the cut today, it\u2019s unclear if that idea bore any\nfruit. Asked recently whether industry was convinced to pick up some of the\ntab, Hunter told reporters that \u201ccost sharing is not core to our approach on\nCCA.\u201d\n\nThe service\u2019s press release today said that the down select decision \u201cdoes not\nexclude any of the vendors from competing for the future Increment 1\nproduction contract\u201d \u2014 likely suggesting companies would have to spend\ninternal funds to move their designs forward and compete for an eventual\nproduction deal.\n\n## What Companies Pitched, And What Comes Next\n\nWhen it comes to specific designs, GA-ASI has stated that the company\u2019s Gambit\ndrone family would be its entry, while Anduril\u2019s acquisition last year of\nautonomous aircraft vendor Blue Force positioned the Fury drone to be\nAnduril\u2019s bid. In images today touting the company\u2019s win, Anduril showcased\nthe Fury drone, appearing to confirm the drone was the company\u2019s bid.\n\n\u201cThere is no time to waste on business as usual. With the CCA program,\nSecretary Kendall and the Air Force have embraced a fast-moving, forward-\nlooking approach to field autonomous systems at speed and scale,\u201d Anduril CEO\nand Co-Founder Brian Schimpf said in a statement. \u201cWe are honored to be\nselected for this unprecedented opportunity, which signals a demand for\ncontinued expansion of the defense industrial base. Anduril is proud to pave\nthe way for other non-traditional defense companies to compete and deliver on\nlarge scale programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout our 30-year history, GA-ASI has been at the forefront of rapidly\nadvancing unmanned aircraft systems that support our warfighters,\u201d GA-ASI\nPresident David Alexander said in a statement. \u201cThe USAF is moving forward\nwith GA-ASI due to our focused commitment to unmanned air-to-air combat\noperations and unmatched UAS experience, ensuring the production of the CCA\naircraft at scale to deliver affordable combat mass for the warfighter.\u201d\n\nBoeing said in a statement today that the aerospace giant offered a\n\u201cproprietary solution tailored to the U.S. Air Force\u2019s unique CCA phase one\nrequirements,\u201d and did not pitch the MQ-25 Stingray or MQ-28 Ghost Bat.\n\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed that we won\u2019t be moving forward in this phase of\nthe Air Force\u2019s CCA program, we are undeterred in our commitment to providing\nnext-generation autonomous combat aircraft for U.S. and global military\ncustomers. Work continues on our robust and growing autonomous family,\nincluding the MQ-25 Stingray and future derivatives, the MQ-28 Ghost Bat, and\na number of proprietary programs we can\u2019t disclose,\u201d Boeing said.\n\nLockheed and Northrop have also not confirmed what candidates they put\nforward.\n\nIn a statement, Lockheed said the company \u201cremains committed to advancing the\nstate of the art in autonomous systems for air and ground missions. Our work\nto develop and integrate pathfinding open architectures, ground control\nsystems like the Multi-Domain Combat SystemTM, human factors interfaces, and\nmission systems continues. For some time, we\u2019ve been focused on bringing to\nlife the transformative power of autonomous and AI/ML enabled operations in\ncrewed and uncrewed DoD systems, with particular focus on integrating CCA with\nF-35 and F-22. These commitments and work are ongoing.\u201d\n\nA representative for Northrop did not immediately respond to a request for\ncomment.\n\nA second parallel effort under CCA is also known to be working on the drones\u2019\nautonomous software, though it\u2019s unclear what companies are involved. Hunter\nsaid last year the service already had 20 to 30 vendors working on that\nelement of CCA work, and more recently said in February that the autonomy\npiece would continue independent of progress on the hardware side.\n\n### Recommended\n\n  * #### Clearing smoke: Boeing swapping out AH-64E Apache generators, eyes new generator options\n\n  * #### Missile Defense Agency\u2019s new long-range radar steps toward full deployment\n\nSponsored\n\n  * GA-ASI\u2019s MQ-9B: The right UAV for persistence, power, and performance\n\n  * B-21, hypersonics and more: How digital development is driving industry innovation\n\n  * A new approach to speed, scale and efficiency for the industrial base\n\n  * Why cloud modernization is critical to multi-domain operations\n\n  * Topics: Air Force, Andrew Hunter, Anduril, autonomy, Boeing, collaborative combat aircraft, Frank Kendall, GA-ASI, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman\n\n### Latest from Breaking Defense\n\n### Air Force picks Anduril, General Atomics for next round of CCA work\n\n### Sullivan says Ukraine supplemental should cover all of 2024, long-range\nATACMS now in Ukraine\n\n### Space Force EW unit working to integrate new weapon systems, intel\npersonnel\n\n### Clearing smoke: Boeing swapping out AH-64E Apache generators, eyes new\ngenerator options\n\nAir Warfare, Networks / Cyber, Sponsored\n\n### B-21, hypersonics and more: How digital development is driving industry\ninnovation\n\nAir Warfare, Networks / Cyber, Sponsored\n\n### B-21, hypersonics and more: How digital development is driving industry\ninnovation\n\nAir Warfare, Networks / Cyber, Sponsored\n\n### B-21, hypersonics and more: How digital development is driving industry\ninnovation\n\nTechnological advancements are key to keeping pace with customer demands and\nevolving threat landscapes.\n\nFrom Breaking Defense\n\nTechnological advancements are key to keeping pace with customer demands and\nevolving threat landscapes.\n\nFrom Breaking Defense\n\nRecommended\n\n### Norway\u2019s top officer on his \u2018biggest challenge,\u2019 next frigate and new NATO\nneighbors\n\n### Lockheed Martin projects potential $1 billion loss on classified program\n\nAir Warfare, Sponsored\n\n### A new approach to speed, scale and efficiency for the industrial base\n\nAir Warfare, Sponsored\n\n### A new approach to speed, scale and efficiency for the industrial base\n\nAir Warfare, Sponsored\n\n### A new approach to speed, scale and efficiency for the industrial base\n\nRadars, EW, EO/IR, space imagery, and microelectronics are brought under one\nroof for a streamlined approach to common people and factories.\n\nFrom Breaking Defense\n\nRadars, EW, EO/IR, space imagery, and microelectronics are brought under one\nroof for a streamlined approach to common people and factories.\n\nFrom Breaking Defense\n\n  * Sign up and get Breaking Defense news in your inbox.\n\nWe will never sell or share your information without your consent.
