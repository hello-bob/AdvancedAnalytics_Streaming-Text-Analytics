MIT President Sally Kornbluth and\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman covered all that and more in a wide-ranging discussion\non MIT\u2019s campus May 2.\n\nThe success of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT large language models has helped spur a wave\nof investment and innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.\nChatGPT-3.5 became the fastest-growing consumer software application in\nhistory after its release at the end of 2022, with hundreds of millions of\npeople using the tool. Since then, OpenAI has also demonstrated AI-driven\nimage-, audio-, and video-generation products and partnered with Microsoft.\n\nThe event, which took place in a packed Kresge Auditorium, captured the\nexcitement of the moment around AI, with an eye toward what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201cI think most of us remember the first time we saw ChatGPT and were like, \u2018Oh\nmy god, that is so cool!\u2019\u201d Kornbluth said. \u201cNow we\u2019re trying to figure out\nwhat the next generation of all this is going to be.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Altman welcomes the high expectations around his company and the\nfield of artificial intelligence more broadly.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s awesome that for two weeks, everybody was freaking out about\nChatGPT-4, and then by the third week, everyone was like, \u2018Come on, where\u2019s\nGPT-5?\u2019\u201d Altman said. \u201cI think that says something legitimately great about\nhuman expectation and striving and why we all have to [be working to] make\nthings better.\u201d\n\nThe problems with AI\n\nEarly on in their discussion, Kornbluth and Altman discussed the many ethical\ndilemmas posed by AI.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve made surprisingly good progress around how to align a system\naround a set of values,\u201d Altman said. \u201cAs much as people like to say \u2018You\ncan\u2019t use these things because they\u2019re spewing toxic waste all the time,\u2019\nGPT-4 behaves kind of the way you want it to, and we\u2019re able to get it to\nfollow a given set of values, not perfectly well, but better than I expected\nby this point.\u201d\n\nAltman also pointed out that people don\u2019t agree on exactly how an AI system\nshould behave in many situations, complicating efforts to create a universal\ncode of conduct.\n\n\u201cHow do we decide what values a system should have?\u201d Altman asked. \u201cHow do we\ndecide what a system should do? How much does society define boundaries versus\ntrusting the user with these tools? Not everyone will use them the way we\nlike, but that\u2019s just kind of the case with tools. I think it\u2019s important to\ngive people a lot of control ... but there are some things a system just\nshouldn\u2019t do, and we\u2019ll have to collectively negotiate what those are.\u201d\n\nKornbluth agreed doing things like eradicating bias in AI systems will be\ndifficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to think about whether or not we can make models less biased\nthan we are as human beings,\u201d she said.\n\nKornbluth also brought up privacy concerns associated with the vast amounts of\ndata needed to train today\u2019s large language models. Altman said society has\nbeen grappling with those concerns since the dawn of the internet, but AI is\nmaking such considerations more complex and higher-stakes. He also sees\nentirely new questions raised by the prospect of powerful AI systems.\n\n\u201cHow are we going to navigate the privacy versus utility versus safety\ntradeoffs?\u201d Altman asked. \u201cWhere we all individually decide to set those\ntradeoffs, and the advantages that will be possible if someone lets the system\nbe trained on their entire life, is a new thing for society to navigate. I\ndon\u2019t know what the answers will be.\u201d\n\nFor both privacy and energy consumption concerns surrounding AI, Altman said\nhe believes progress in future versions of AI models will help.\n\n\"What we want out of GPT-5 or 6 or whatever is for it to be the best reasoning\nengine possible,\u201d Altman said. \u201cIt is true that right now, the only way we\u2019re\nable to do that is by training it on tons and tons of data. In that process,\nit\u2019s learning something about how to do very, very limited reasoning or\ncognition or whatever you want to call it. But the fact that it can memorize\ndata, or the fact that it\u2019s storing data at all in its parameter space, I\nthink we'll look back and say, \u2018That was kind of a weird waste of resources.\u2019\nI assume at some point, we\u2019ll figure out how to separate the reasoning engine\nfrom the need for tons of data or storing the data in [the model], and be able\nto treat them as separate things.\u201d\n\nKornbluth also asked about how AI might lead to job displacement.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that annoys me most about people who work on AI is when\nthey stand up with a straight face and say, \u2018This will never cause any job\nelimination. This is just an additive thing. This is just all going to be\ngreat,\u2019\u201d Altman said. \u201cThis is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and\nthis is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function, and this\nis going to create entirely new jobs. That always happens with technology.\"\n\nThe promise of AI\n\nAltman believes progress in AI will make grappling with all of the field\u2019s\ncurrent problems worth it.\n\n\u201cIf we spent 1 percent of the world\u2019s electricity training a powerful AI, and\nthat AI helped us figure out how to get to non-carbon-based energy or make\ndeep carbon capture better, that would be a massive win,\u201d Altman said.\n\nHe also said the application of AI he\u2019s most interested in is scientific\ndiscovery.\n\n\u201cI believe [scientific discovery] is the core engine of human progress and\nthat it is the only way we drive sustainable economic growth,\u201d Altman said.\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t content with GPT-4. They want things to get better. Everyone\nwants life more and better and faster, and science is how we get there.\u201d\n\nKornbluth also asked Altman for his advice for students thinking about their\ncareers. He urged students not to limit themselves.\n\n\u201cThe most important lesson to learn early on in your career is that you can\nkind of figure anything out, and no one has all of the answers when they start\nout,\u201d Altman said. \u201cYou just sort of stumble your way through, have a fast\niteration speed, and try to drift toward the most interesting problems to you,\nand be around the most impressive people and have this trust that you\u2019ll\nsuccessfully iterate to the right thing. ... You can do more than you think,\nfaster than you think.\u201d\n\nThe advice was part of a broader message Altman had about staying optimistic\nand working to create a better future.\n\n\u201cThe way we are teaching our young people that the world is totally screwed\nand that it\u2019s hopeless to try to solve problems, that all we can do is sit in\nour bedrooms in the dark and think about how awful we are, is a really deeply\nunproductive streak,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI hope MIT is different than a lot of\nother college campuses. I assume it is. But you all need to make it part of\nyour life mission to fight against this. Prosperity, abundance, a better life\nnext year, a better life for our children. That is the only path forward. That\nis the only way to have a functioning society ... and the anti-progress\nstreak, the anti \u2018people deserve a great life\u2019 streak, is something I hope you\nall fight against.\u201d\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\n## Related Links\n\n  * President Sally Kornbluth\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Special events and guest speakers\n  * Machine learning\n  * Artificial intelligence\n  * Technology and society\n  * Human-computer interaction\n  * President Sally Kornbluth\n  * Invention\n  * Community\n  * Labor and jobs\n  * Ethics\n  * Sustainability\n  * History of science\n  * Careers\n  * Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E)\n  * Business and management\n  * School of Engineering\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n  * School of Science\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### MIT faculty, instructors, students experiment with generative AI in\nteaching and learning\n\n### A crossroads for computing at MIT\n\n### A faster, better way to prevent an AI chatbot from giving toxic responses\n\n### MIT Generative AI Week fosters dialogue across disciplines\n\n## More MIT News\n\n### William Green named director of MIT Energy Initiative\n\nIn his new role, the professor of chemical engineering plans to speed up the\nconsensus process among academics, business leaders, and policymakers for a\nsuccessful energy transition.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Seizing solar\u2019s bright future\n\nWith laser-based precision tools for measuring and tuning materials, MIT\nspinout Optigon aims to rev up the energy transition.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### MIT astronomers observe elusive stellar light surrounding ancient quasars\n\nThe observations suggest some of earliest \u201cmonster\u201d black holes grew from\nmassive cosmic seeds.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Creating bespoke programming languages for efficient visual AI systems\n\nAssociate Professor Jonathan Ragan-Kelley optimizes how computer graphics and\nimages are processed for the hardware of today and tomorrow.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### HPI-MIT design research collaboration creates powerful teams\n\nTogether, the Hasso Plattner Institute and MIT are working toward novel\nsolutions to the world\u2019s problems as part of the Designing for Sustainability\nresearch program.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### MIT conductive concrete consortium cements five-year research agreement\nwith Japanese industry\n\nThe MIT EC^3 Hub, an outgrowth of the MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub, will\ndevelop multifunctional concrete applications for infrastructure.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n  * More news on MIT News homepage \u2192\n\n## More about MIT News at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office\nof Communications.\n\n### News by Schools/College:\n\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n### Resources:\n\n  * About the MIT News Office\n  * MIT News Press Center\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Press Inquiries\n  * Filming Guidelines\n  * RSS Feeds\n\n### Tools:\n\n  * Subscribe to MIT Daily/Weekly\n  * Subscribe to press releases\n  * Submit campus news\n  * Guidelines for campus news contributors\n  * Guidelines on generative AI\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA,\nUSA\n\nRecommended Links:\n\n  * Visit\n  * Map (opens in new window)\n  * Events (opens in new window)\n  * People (opens in new window)\n  * Careers (opens in new window)\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Accessibility\n  *     * Social Media Hub\n    * MIT on X\n    * MIT on Facebook\n    * MIT on YouTube\n    * MIT on Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
