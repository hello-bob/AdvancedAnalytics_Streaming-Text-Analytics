Experts\nwarn these attacks could potentially impact critical infrastructure,\ncommunication networks, and more.\n\nVideo: Cameron Getty; Getty Images\n\nThe disruption to GPS services started getting worse on Christmas Day. Planes\nand ships moving around southern Sweden and Poland lost connectivity as their\nradio signals were interfered with. Since then, the region around the Baltic\nSea\u2014including neighboring Germany, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania\u2014has\nfaced persistent attacks against GPS systems.\n\nTens of thousands of planes flying in the region have reported problems with\ntheir navigation systems in recent months amid widespread jamming attacks,\nwhich can make GPS inoperable. As the attacks have grown, Russia has\nincreasingly been blamed, with open source researchers tracking the source to\nRussian regions such as Kaliningrad. In one instance, signals were disrupted\nfor 47 hours continuously. On Monday, marking one of the most serious\nincidents yet, airline Finnair canceled its flights to Tartu, Estonia, for a\nmonth, after GPS interference forced two of its planes to abort landings at\nthe airport and turn around.\n\nThe jamming in the Baltic region, which was first spotted in early 2022, is\njust the tip of the iceberg. In recent years, there has been a rapid uptick in\nattacks against GPS signals and wider satellite navigation systems, known as\nGNSS, including those of Europe, China, and Russia. The attacks can jam\nsignals, essentially forcing them offline, or spoof the signals, making\naircraft and ships appear at false locations on maps. Beyond the Baltics, war\nzone areas around Ukraine and the Middle East have also seen sharp rises in\nGPS disruptions, including signal blocking meant to disrupt airborne attacks.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nNow, governments and telecom and airline safety experts are increasingly\nsounding the alarm about the disruptions and the potential for major\ndisasters. Foreign ministers in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have all blamed\nRussia for GPS issues in the Baltics this week and said the threat should be\ntaken seriously.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be ruled out that this jamming is a form of hybrid warfare with the\naim of creating uncertainty and unrest,\u201d Jimmie Adamsson, the chief of public\naffairs for the Swedish Navy, tells WIRED. \u201cOf course, there are concerns,\nmostly for civilian shipping and aviation, that an accident will occur\ncreating an environmental disaster. There is also a risk that ships and\naircraft will stop traffic to this area and therefore global trade will be\naffected.\u201d\n\n\u201cA growing threat situation must be expected in connection with GPS jamming,\u201d\nJoe Wagner, a spokesperson from Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Information\nSecurity, tells WIRED, saying there are technical ways to reduce its impact.\nOfficials in Finland say they have also seen an increase in airline\ndisruptions in and around the country. And a spokesperson for the\nInternational Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency, tells WIRED\nthat the number of jamming and spoofing incidents have \u201cincreased\nsignificantly\u201d over the past four years, and interfering with radio signals is\nprohibited under the ITU\u2019s rules.\n\n## On the Upswing\n\nAttacks against GPS, and the wider GNSS category, come in two forms. First,\nGPS jamming looks to overwhelm the radio signals that make up GPS and make the\nsystems unusable. Second, spoofing attacks can replace the original signal\nwith a new location\u2014spoofed ships can, for example, appear on maps as if\nthey\u2019re at inland airports.\n\nBoth types of interference are up in frequency. The disruptions\u2014at least at\nthis stage\u2014mostly impact planes flying at high altitudes and ships that can be\nin open water, not people\u2019s individual phones or other systems that rely on\nGPS.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nMillions of Americans Might Lose Internet Access Today.

Benoit Figuet, an academic at the Zurich University\nof Applied Sciences who also runs a live GPS spoofing map, says there have\nbeen an additional 44,000 spoofing incidents logged since the start of this\nyear.\n\n#### Content\n\nTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site\nit originates from.\n\nEarlier this month, more than 15,000 planes had their locations spoofed to\nBeirut Airport, according to data Figuet shared with WIRED. More than 10,000\nwere spoofed to Cairo Airport, while more than 2,000 had their locations\nshowing in Yaroslavl in Russia, the data shows. Separate analysis from\ngeospatial intelligence company Geollect shared with WIRED shows that on April\n16, around 55 ships broadcast their location as being over the main runway at\nSimferopol International Airport in Crimea, Ukraine. The airport is around 19\nmiles inland from the Black Sea, where it\u2019s believed the ships were actually\nlocated.\n\n\u201cThe biggest change in the past six months is definitely the amount of\nspoofing that\u2019s going on,\u201d says Zach Clements, a graduate research assistant\nat the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cFor the first time, we\u2019re seeing\nwidespread disruptions in civil aviation, especially in the Eastern\nMediterranean, the Baltics, and the Middle East. In prior years, there were\nreports of spoofing impacting marine vessels, but not aviation.\u201d\n\nClements says there appear to be three spoofers that can be traced back to\nRussia. One open source intelligence analyst, going by the pseudonym Markus\nJonsson, has located jamming in the Baltics, and that which impacted the\nFinnish airline this week, to Kaliningrad and other Russian locations. One\nresearch group has suggested disruption near Poland impacted Russia\u2019s own GNSS\nsystem less than others. Russia has a long history of interfering with GPS\nsignals both within its borders and internationally. Russia\u2019s embassy in the\nUK did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nMillions of Americans Might Lose Internet Access Today.

A spokesperson for Eurocontrol, a European\naviation organization with more than 40 countries as members, says its\nanalysis shows disruptions are happening in the Eastern Mediterranean, areas\naround Ukraine and the Black Sea, as well as the Baltic states. During one\nweek in March, 4,387 aircraft reported issues, the Eurocontrol spokesperson\nsays, while for the same week last year, there were 2,646 flights reporting\nproblems.\n\nThe Eurocontrol spokesperson says planes can fly safely without GNSS, but\ninterference \u201cputs a higher workload on pilots and air traffic control.\u201d A\nsafety notice issued by the UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority this month says loss\nof GNSS can result in navigation issues, incorrect emergency \u201cterrain\u201d\nwarnings that the plane is low to the ground, and the failure of various other\nsystems.\n\n\u201cI have flown with crew members who were not fully aware of this problem,\u201d one\npilot said in a NASA report detailing GPS incidents that was also published\nthis month. Other pilots said they had received \u201cfalse terrain warnings\u201d that\ncaused them to pull up and that pilots should have a \u201cthorough review of\njamming affects on the different aircraft systems\u201d as part of their training.\n\nJari P\u00f6ntinen, a director at Traficom, the Finnish transport and\ncommunications agency, says there has been an increase in disruptions both\nclose to and in Finland since the beginning of this year. P\u00f6ntinen, who was\nformerly a pilot, says flight operators need to make sure they have made\n\u201ccomprehensive risk assessments\u201d and to properly train pilots about what to\nexpect if GPS disruptions occur.\n\n## Threats Big and Small\n\nThe increase in GPS disruptions has partly coincided with Russia\u2019s full-scale\nwar in Ukraine and Israel\u2019s attacks in Gaza. Disrupting GPS as part of\nelectronic warfare has become common on Russia and Ukraine\u2019s battlefields as a\nway to try to limit the operation of drones. And while Iran launched a barrage\nof missiles and drones against Israel on April 13, Israeli GPS disruption\ndesigned to limit the impact of the attack also impacted mapping and taxi\nservices as well as food delivery.\n\nKevin Heneka, the founder of cybersecurity company Hensec whose work includes\ndetecting GPS disruptions, says jamming and spoofing technology has become\ncheaper and smaller over the years, to the extent that individuals can install\nthem in their cars to hide their movements. However, Heneka says, more\nsophisticated attacks use equipment that can cost huge sums. \u201cIn conflict\nzones, in military terms, and in professional terms, this spoofing is very\nsophisticated, and it always goes hand in hand with jamming,\u201d he says.\n\nAs the number of jamming and spoofing incidents increases, there is a growing\nconcern that the disruption of crucial services could become normalized.\nMultiple experts worry that the full extent of GPS interference is not known,\nand systems beyond those of airlines and shipping may be at risk if the\ndisruption becomes more widespread.\n\n\u201cMany do not realize that GNSS is not only used in your mobile phone for\nnavigation, but is also a primary source of time synchronization for vital\ninfrastructure: power grid systems, data centers, automatic train control\nsystems, communication systems\u2014especially 5G\u2014financial services, and any\ndistributed management and control systems,\u201d says Maksim Barodzka, the CEO of\nGNSS-detection firm GPSPatron. \u201cWhat's happening with this infrastructure is\nnot widely reported in the public domain.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our WIRED Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * A hacker took down North Korea\u2019s internet.
