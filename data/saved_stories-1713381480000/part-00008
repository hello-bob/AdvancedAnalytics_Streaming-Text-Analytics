Parks III\u201445 of Omaha,\nNebraska\u2014with wire fraud, money laundering, and engaging in unlawful monetary\ntransactions in connection with the scheme. Parks has yet to enter a plea and\nis scheduled to make an initial appearance in federal court in Omaha on\nTuesday. Parks was arrested last Friday.\n\nProsecutors allege that Parks defrauded \u201ctwo well-known providers of cloud\ncomputing services\u201d of more than $3.5 million in computing resources to mine\ncryptocurrency. The indictment says the activity was in furtherance of a\ncryptojacking scheme, a term for crimes that generate digital coin through the\nacquisition of computing resources and electricity of others through fraud,\nhacking, or other illegal means.\n\nDetails laid out in the indictment underscore the failed economics involved in\nthe mining of most cryptocurrencies. The $3.5 million of computing resources\nyielded roughly $1 million worth of cryptocurrency. In the process, massive\namounts of energy were consumed.\n\nParks\u2019 scheme allegedly used a variety of personal and business identities to\nregister \u201cnumerous accounts\u201d with the two cloud providers and in the process\nacquiring vast amounts of computing processing power and storage that he never\npaid for. Prosecutors said he tricked the providers into allotting him\nelevated levels of services and deferred billing accommodations and deflected\nthe providers\u2019 inquiries regarding questionable data usage in unpaid bills. He\nallegedly then used those resources to mine Ether, Litecoin, and Monero\ndigital currencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe defendant then allegedly laundered the proceeds through cryptocurrency\nexchanges, an NFT marketplace, an online payment provider, and traditional\nbank accounts in an attempt to disguise the illegal scheme. Once proceeds had\nbeen converted to dollars, Parks allegedly bought a Mercedes-Benz, jewelry,\nfirst-class hotel and travel accommodations, and other luxury goods and\nservices.\n\nFrom January to August 2021, prosecutors allege, Parks created five accounts\nwith the Seattle-based \u201con-demand cloud computing platform\u201d using different\nnames, email addresses, and corporate affiliations. He then allegedly \u201ctricked\nand defrauded\u201d employees of the platform into providing elevated levels of\nservice, deferring billing payments, and failing to discover the activity.\n\nDuring this time, Parks repeatedly requested that the provider \u201cprovide him\naccess to powerful and expensive instances that included graphics processing\nunits used for cryptocurrency mining and launched tens of thousands of these\ninstances to mine cryptocurrency, employing mining software applications to\nfacilitate the mining of tokens including ETH, LTC and XMR in various mining\npools, and employing tools that allowed him to maximize cloud computing power\nand monitor which instances were actively mining on each mining pool,\u201d\nprosecutors wrote in the indictment.\n\nWithin a day of having one account suspended for nonpayment and fraudulent\nactivity, Parks allegedly used a new account with the provider. In all, Parks\nallegedly consumed more than $2.5 million of the Seattle-based provider\u2019s\nservices.\n\nThe prosecutors went on to allege that Parks used similar tactics to defraud\nthe Redmond provider of more than $969,000 in cloud computing and related\nservices.\n\nProsecutors didn\u2019t say precisely how Parks was able to trick the providers\ninto giving him elevated services, deferring unpaid payments, or failing to\ndiscover the allegedly fraudulent behavior. They also didn\u2019t identify either\nof the cloud providers by name. Based on the details, however, they are almost\ncertainly Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Representatives from both\nproviders didn\u2019t immediately return emails seeking confirmation.\n\nIf convicted on all charges, Parks faces as much as 30 years in prison.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n92\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
