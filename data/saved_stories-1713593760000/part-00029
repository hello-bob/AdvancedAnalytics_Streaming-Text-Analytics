The Reg FOSS\ndesk looked at the two Qt-centric remixes, and found some intriguing\ndistinctions between them and their parent distro.\n\nThe beta of Lubuntu 24.04 offers a new choice: live session or proceed\ndirectly to installation - Click to enlarge\n\nWhen we did a roundup of the remixes for the last LTS release cycle, 22.04, we\nnoted that Lubuntu was a little different from the other flavors. For\ninstance, Lubuntu 22.04 booted direct to a live session without asking, and if\nyou did choose to install, it used the Calamares cross-platform installer,\nrather than Canonical's own tool.\n\nThese are aside from its svelteness. It's fairly well known as the lightest\nweight member of the Ubuntu family, taking less disk and less RAM than the\nothers. That's a good thing, even if you are not short of resources: there's\nless to go wrong, it represents a smaller attack surface, and it leaves more\nresources available for your apps. A few Reg readers have told us that Lubuntu\nis their go-to Ubuntu remix, for its simple, no-nonsense approach as well as\nits modest resource usage, and we can't fault that stance.\n\nIt looks like the Noble Numbat release will offer some more functional\ndifferences over and above these. For instance, this release offers the option\nto install directly from boot-up, without starting a full desktop session.\nSince this is a flavor of particular interest to those who want a lighter-\nweight OS, it's good to see that the Calamares installer offers a \"minimal\"\ninstallation option \u2013 historically, some of the remixes didn't offer this.\n\nAs we reported back in February, with the 24.04 LTS release, Kubuntu is also\nswitching to using Calamares as its installation program. We tried the betas\nof both Lubuntu and Kubuntu to see how the new installer is looking.\n\nNot two but three types of installation: normal, minimal, and even full, with\nextra snappy apps - Click to enlarge\n\nThis highlighted a difference that we weren't expecting: a three-way choice of\ninstallation types. In the betas of both Kubuntu and Lubuntu, you don't just\nget Ubuntu's \"Normal\" and \"Minimal\" offerings, but also an optional \"Full\"\ninstallation, which adds some extra packages to the mix. This adds the Element\nclient for Matrix, the Thunderbird multi-protocol messaging client, the\nVirtual Machine Manager for libvirt-compatible hypervisors, and KDE's Krita\nimage-editing program. (It is perhaps churlish of us to point out that\nThunderbird itself includes a Matrix client, but we must run that risk.)\n\n  * Lightweight Windows-like desktop LXQt makes leap to Qt 6 with version 2.0\n  * Ubuntu, Kubuntu, openSUSE to get better installation\n  * Cinnamon and KDE sync version numbers in desktop sibling rivalry\n  * Revamped Raspberry Pi OS boasts Wayland desktop and improved imager tool\n\nOne of the more common complaints about Ubuntu in recent years is its growing\nfondness for packaging applications in Canonical's snap format. In the beta\nversion of the standard Ubuntu desktop the Thunderbird email client is now a\nsnap as well. Upstream Ubuntu also has a new Snap-centric App Centre, which no\nlonger supports Debian packages: it's snaps or nothing. It should come as no\nsurprise, then, that if you choose the Full install option in Lubuntu and\nKubuntu 24.04, the additional apps are installed as snap versions.\n\nInstead of the Snap-based App Centre, Lubuntu offers KDE's Discover \u2013 but the\nbeta has glitches - Click to enlarge\n\nHowever, there is some good news for Lubuntu users. The new version includes a\nlittle extra instrumentation around the snap format, and Lubuntu \"Noble\"\nincludes on-screen status notifications when Snap packages are installing in\nthe background, thanks to a new program called lubuntu-snap-installation-\nmonitor. It also has a new first-run wizard, and alongside the standard\nLubuntu login session, there are options for an unthemed LXQt session as well\nas a very bare login session with the OpenBox window manager and nothing else.\n\nIf you choose the Qt-based editions, though, you get the KDE Discover\ngraphical app store instead. This supports both Snap and Debian packages, and\nif you install the optional Flatpak back-end, it supports that package format\nas well. We did see some graphical glitches with Discover in the Lubuntu Noble\nbeta, though, which made it unusable in Virtualbox. We tried the Virtualbox\nguest additions, and the equally FOSS VMware graphics driver, but neither\nhelped. We hope this is resolved before release \u2013 it works fine in Kubuntu\nitself.\n\nThe beta of Kubuntu 24.04 shows what the Discover app is meant to look like -\nClick to enlarge\n\nAs we reported in February, KDE Plasma 6 was released just a little too late\nto be included in the latest Kubuntu. Both Lubuntu and Kubuntu 24.04 come with\nthe previous stable versions of their respective desktops: LXQt 1.4 and KDE\nPlasma 5.27.11. That means that by default, no Wayland sessions are on offer\nhere, just plain old X.org. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Ubuntu\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Ubuntu\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Canonical\n  * Debian\n\n#### More about\n\n7 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Ubuntu\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Ubuntu\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Canonical\n  * Debian\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### NetBSD 10 proves old tech can still kick apps and take names three\ndecades later\n\nFOSDEM 2024 Proper old-school Unix, not like those lazy, decadent Linux types\n\nOSes2 days | 37\n\n#### AlmaLinux 9.4 beta prepares to tread where RHEL dares not\n\nCIQ also has an alternative approach to compatible kernels with RockyLinux\n\nOSes2 days | 5\n\n#### OpenBSD 7.5 locks down with improved disk encryption support and syscall\nlimitations\n\nThe most secure Unix-like OS to date?\n\nOSes7 days | 49\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### VMS Software prunes OpenVMS hobbyist program\n\nVintage OS editions go the way of the dodo as VSI cranks up exclusivity\n\nApplications10 days | 54\n\n#### Linux Foundation is leading fight against fauxpen source\n\nOpinion Shifts its transmission from vendor neutral into open source gear\n\nApplications7 days | 37\n\n#### Canonical cracks down on crypto cons following Snap Store scam spree\n\nIn happier news, Ubuntu Pro extended support now goes up to 12 years\n\nSecurity22 days | 18\n\n#### After delay due to xz, Ubuntu 24.04 'Noble Numbat' belatedly hits beta\n\nKernel 6.8, GNOME 46, and more apps in Snap packages\n\nOSes4 days | 29\n\n#### Open sourcerers say suspected xz-style attacks continue to target\nmaintainers\n\nSocial engineering patterns spotted across range of popular projects\n\nSecurity3 days | 29\n\n#### Valkey publishes release candidate and attracts new backer\n\nOpen source Redis alternative gathers momentum\n\nDatabases2 days | 5\n\n#### Open source versus Microsoft: The new rebellion begins\n\nOpinion Neither side can afford to lose, but one surely must\n\nSaaS4 days | 181\n\n#### Debian spices up APT package manager with a dash of color, squishes\nancient bug\n\n2.9 gives a taste of what's to come\n\nOSes1 day | 32\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
