Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes.

Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices.

His screen name was professorparsley,\nand he looked the part \u2014 tall and thin, with glasses, features that Rose found\nattractive. On their first date, Rose learned that Will was a college student\nliving with his mother, and his handle came from a nickname given to him by a\nchild at an art camp where he worked. They laugh about it now, as they do with\nmost things. Will thought Rose was exciting and direct. He grew up in suburban\nOntario, and she was from Southern California, which was like another world to\nhim. Right away, what they loved about each other were their differences.\n\n### Listen to this article, read by Julia Whelan\n\nListen 21:27\n\nRose was drawn to how stable Will seemed \u2014 so unlike the other men she had\ndated, who dreaded commitment. Their relationship survived multiple moves,\nabout a year of long-distance dating and the challenges of finding time to be\ntogether while living with parents and roommates. Now, seven years into their\nmarriage, they have their own place: a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles,\nwhere Rose sees Pilates clients. Will is gone during the day, teaching, and at\nnight they cuddle in bed and watch television. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite part of the\nday,\u201d Rose says. (Rose and Will are middle names. All subjects asked to be\nreferred to by their first names, middle names or a nickname, out of concerns\nfor their privacy.)\n\nAs much as Will grounds her, Rose feels that the familiar calm of their\nrelationship also shuts her down sexually. They go months without sex, but\nthey don\u2019t lack intimacy. They have a policy of never refusing a hug,\nsomething they instituted to resolve the minor disagreements that inevitably\ncrop up in any relationship. They have also talked candidly about how, for\nher, the safe predictability of their marriage \u2014 the quality she loves about\ntheir lives together \u2014 dulls her sex drive. She knows that can be confusing,\neven frustrating, for Will, but she doesn\u2019t like the idea of forcing herself\nto have sex. Rose\u2019s mother, now divorced, felt obligated to have sex with\nRose\u2019s father once a week. That\u2019s not the kind of relationship Rose wants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo get into a sexual mood, Rose relies on a set of rituals to help build\nanticipation \u2014 doing her hair and makeup, shaving her legs, having a glass of\nwine over dinner or, when their schedules allow, going on vacation to break\nout of their routines. Will doesn\u2019t need to do anything to feel ready for sex,\nand Rose sees this as another way in which they\u2019re different. Over the years,\nthey have accepted that this is what their sex life looks like, and will look\nlike, if they want to be together, which they do.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the couple went more than a year without having sex, but\nthey savored their extra time together. Rose used to spend hours driving in\ntraffic to different workout studios, coming home late, not seeing her husband\nmuch. Stuck at home, they took walks around their neighborhood. They talked\nconstantly. They started taking online yoga classes together, a hobby that\nstuck. Will appreciates these smaller opportunities to connect. Rose thinks\nshe\u2019s not the nurturing type, but Will disagrees. \u201cShe\u2019s not stingy in spirit\nor time,\u201d he says.\n\nSometimes they shower together and hold each other naked, without any\nexpectation of sex. Though Will remains hopeful that these moments will lead\nto something else, he doesn\u2019t push it.\n\nCultural attitudes about the role sex plays in a marriage have evolved\nsignificantly over time. Where once marital sex was primarily a means for\nbearing children, in recent decades, the conventional wisdom was that frequent\nsex was integral to a happy union. During the 1990s, a new wave of sex\npositivity coincided with the ascendancy of different forms of therapy,\nincluding couples counseling. Experts coached couples on how to strengthen\ntheir marriages, often relying on the belief that healthy relationships\nincluded consistent sex with partners. By the 2010s, appointment sex had\nbecome one popular method for maintaining intimacy and, somewhat implicitly,\nsafeguarding against separation.\n\nIn more recent years, however, both relationship experts and couples\nthemselves have been gradually dismantling some of these commonly held views,\nworking to destigmatize the unconventional approaches that some take to stay\ntogether. Online groups have sprung up for couples who challenge basic\nassumptions that spouses should share a bedroom or even a home. Sharon Hyman,\nwho runs a Facebook group called Apartners for couples who have chosen to live\nseparately, told me that many of the members in her community find their sex\nlives improve when they don\u2019t spend every minute together. \u201cMy goal is to show\nthat there are healthy options for relationships,\u201d Hyman says. \u201cNo one size\nfits all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne effect of the ever-changing sexual climate is that many couples today are\nsimply less willing to tolerate what the psychotherapist Esther Perel calls\n\u201cboredom\u201d in the bedroom. Perel has made a career of articulating how domestic\noverexposure saps eroticism, which requires some intrigue, mystery and\nunfamiliarity. That\u2019s not to suggest that long-term love and desire are\nimpossible, but according to Perel, keeping sexual interest alive requires\ngetting creative. In her podcast, \u201cWhere Should We Begin?\u201d Perel helps couples\nexplore and articulate their fantasies, honor each other as individuals and\nexperiment with new approaches to fulfilling their desires together.\n\nFor Perel, as for many other relationship experts, that sometimes means re-\nexamining investment in another foundational premise of marriage: monogamy.\nThe advice columnist Dan Savage, too, has argued that monogamy isn\u2019t entirely\nplausible, or pleasurable, for everyone, and is critical of Americans\u2019\nobsession with moralizing infidelity. He encourages married people to be\nhonest with each other about how hard it is to carry the responsibility of\nfulfilling their partner\u2019s sexual and emotional needs for decades on end.\n\nImage\n\nCredit...Tonje Thilesen for The New York Times\n\nWhile some are questioning the standard of monogamous sex in marriage by\nexploring polyamorous and open relationships, others are pushing back against\nthe pressure to have sex at all. In fact, Americans on the whole are having\nless sex than they used to \u2014 across race, gender, region, educational level\nand work status. One study found that American adults born in the 1990s are\nhaving less sex than older generations; they are in fewer steady partnerships,\nand those who are partnered are also having less sex. The 2021 General Social\nSurvey found that about 50 percent of all adults polled had sex once a month\nor less, with half of those people reporting they hadn\u2019t had sex for a year.\nResearchers have speculated about the reasons for this 30-year sexual low,\nfrom isolation caused by technology to cultural conversations about consent.\n\nMany younger women, for instance, shaped in part by the #MeToo movement, are\nengaging in intentional abstinence. There are trends on TikTok about going\n\u201cboysober,\u201d a word coined by the comedian Hope Woodard, who says that taking a\nbreak from sex can be empowering for women who previously altered their\ndesires to accommodate men. The digital feminist 4B movement, which originated\nin South Korea but has spread globally through social media, advocates a\nrejection of childbearing, as well as heterosexual dating, marriage and sex.\n\u201cPlatonic life partners,\u201d meanwhile \u2014 friends who commit to owning a home and\neven raising children together \u2014 insist that sex and romance are not necessary\nto lifelong unions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe sex educator and researcher Emily Nagoski is resistant to the idea that\nfrequent sex should be a chief component of every committed relationship.\nNagoski \u2014 who has been open about her own hiatus from marital sex \u2014 doesn\u2019t\nendorse obligatory sex, nor does she encourage aiming for any sexual base line\nin terms of regularity or behavior. Drawing on the work of the Canadian\nsexologist Peggy Kleinplatz, Nagoski believes that low desire can sometimes be\nevidence of good judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s not dysfunctional not to want sex you don\u2019t\nlike,\u201d Nagoski says.\n\nIn her new book, \u201cCome Together,\u201d Nagoski urges couples who want to explore\ntheir sexualities and deepen their sexual bond to begin by figuring out what\neach person wants when they want sex. For many, sex represents freedom from\nthe ordinary, but what it takes to get there will look different for every\ncouple and is likely to change over time. After all, desires don\u2019t always\nalign, or they evolve in unexpected ways.\n\nMichelle and John met in 2005 at a party, and in the early years of their\nrelationship, they couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other. Four years ago,\nhowever, after experiencing what she calls a \u201ctraumatic\u201d childbirth, Michelle\nbegan to worry that intercourse would cause her pain.\n\nShe and John did not have sex for a year after they became parents. Now they\ncan go months without it. Friends of theirs, too, seem to be experiencing new\nchapters in their own sex lives and opening up their marriages, which has\nsparked conversations between Michelle and John about the possibilities for\nreinvigorating their sex life. But they don\u2019t always agree on what they want,\nor what they\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nJohn knows, however, that having sex outside the marriage is a red line for\nMichelle. She witnessed infidelity tear apart her parents\u2019 relationship. \u201cI\nthink there\u2019s a big fear about \u2018I have an urge that may be resolved in a\nminute or two,\u2019 but the sense of what could be broken is not worth the risk,\u201d\nJohn says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLove, for both, is about much more than fulfilling those momentary desires.\nAfter almost two decades together, they consider themselves best friends and\n\u201csoul mates.\u201d When they first began dating, Michelle was reeling from the loss\nof her brother, who died in a car accident. She talked with John about the\nexperience on an early date, and they were inseparable after that. John\nthought she was beautiful and wanted to spend as much time with her as he\ncould. Michelle thought he was a welcome distraction, someone who could lift\nher out of her grief. They went to concerts. He made her mixtapes. But there\nwere also times when she broke down crying, and he was there for her.\n\nJohn used to try to comfort Michelle by saying he understood how she felt, but\nwhen he lost his own brother in 2012, he realized how wrong he had been. As he\nmourned, Michelle \u201cjust knew what to do in the unspoken moments \u2014 whether it\nwas knowing when to give me space, or knowing when I needed a hug, or I just\nneeded her to be next to me,\u201d John says. Today, Michelle remains the \u201ccentral\npiece\u201d of his happiness.\n\nMichelle and John share a one-bedroom with their daughter, and while they get\nsome privacy during the day, they\u2019re busy working from home. Now, most days,\nMichelle masturbates in the morning, while John takes their daughter to\npreschool. He masturbates at night in the bathroom, while watching porn on his\nphone. For John, it\u2019s merely a physical release, but for Michelle, pleasuring\nherself serves a different purpose: She is trying to figure out what makes her\nfeel good. Exploring her changed body alone eliminates the guilt she has when\nshe can\u2019t climax with her husband. She doesn\u2019t want him to think it has\nanything to do with him. \u201cI want to get there, but it\u2019s not getting there,\u201d\nshe says.\n\nOf the more than 30 married people I interviewed, many, like Michelle, told me\nthat becoming parents irrevocably changed their sex lives. Camille, who lives\nin California, felt her marriage was the most solid and caring relationship\nshe had ever experienced, but becoming a mother distanced her from her desire.\n\u201cIt feels like something I can\u2019t quite touch, like in another room, or another\npart of me that I don\u2019t know how to access,\u201d she says.\n\nOther mothers started to see sex as one more chore, another line item on their\nlist of responsibilities. Keti, a mother of a neurodivergent child who craved\nbeing held, found that sex with her husband had become \u201crobotic\u201d as she began\nto see it as \u201cone more demand.\u201d Her husband was doing everything he could to\nsupport her, but she felt an obligation to get back to their old sex life,\neven though she wanted \u201cdesperately to go into a forest and just lie down and\nnot hear anyone or anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLilien, who has two kids, says becoming a mother was a turning point for her.\nShe had to leave her previous career and didn\u2019t know who she was or what she\nwanted. \u201cMy identity was totally eviscerated,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really\nconfused about what my worth was.\u201d Her history of sexual assault also\nresurfaced in profound ways. She thought she needed to be \u201cpermeable\u201d to\nnurture her children. She didn\u2019t have the capacity to extend that physical\nopenness to her husband. She couldn\u2019t stand soft caresses from him, which felt\nlike the tickling of her child\u2019s hands.\n\nLilien\u2019s husband, Philip, never pressured her to be intimate, for which she is\ngrateful. \u201cThe most important thing for me was to maintain a place where the\nsex you have is very positive, very consensual, very understood and mutually\nenjoyed,\u201d he says. Five years later, Philip knows she is still coming to terms\nwith everything motherhood has brought into her life. Recently they started\nhaving more sex, about once every other month. Lilien loves her husband\u2019s firm\nback rubs, which he\u2019s happy to give.\n\nOther couples, much like Rose and Will, confessed to feeling sexually\nmisaligned with their partners as their desires shifted in different\ndirections. Jean, a 38-year-old mother living in Virginia, told me that her\nhusband\u2019s interest in sex has dropped off gradually over the course of their\n13-year marriage. She, on the other hand, experienced what she called \u201ca\nsecondary puberty\u201d as her kids grew older and became less dependent on her.\nShe felt \u201cso sexually charged\u201d that she visited her gynecologist to confirm\nshe wasn\u2019t having a hormonal issue. She\u2019s now trying to figure out how to\nnavigate her husband\u2019s low desire. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m living in the upside-down\na lot of the time,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friends complain about their husbands\ngrabbing their butt while they wash dishes, and I think, Wow, I would love to\nfeel wanted like that.\u201d\n\nAnother mother, Emily, says that sex gradually became less important over the\ncourse of her 34-year marriage. When her kids were little, intimacy with her\nhusband stalled briefly, but as their children grew older, they had a \u201crevival\nof a good sex life,\u201d Emily says. Now she is 59 and has had several operations\nresulting from a battle with cancer, including a hysterectomy and mastectomy.\nAs a result, her desire lessened, and sex began to feel like \u201cvacuuming the\nhouse\u201d \u2014 something she did to make her husband happy. And he noticed. \u201cIf you\nare used to somebody responding to you in a certain way, you can tell when\nthey are acting,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the same person.\u201d\n\nOne night in bed, about 10 years after she went on a hormone treatment for her\ncancer that put her into early menopause, they had a frank conversation about\ntheir sex life. \u201cWe discussed my lack of desire, and he said that if I\u2019m not\nturned on, then he\u2019s not either,\u201d Emily says. He admitted that his sex drive\nhad dipped, too. So they decided not to force it. She feels there\u2019s some\ncultural pressure for older people to keep up their sex lives into their 80s.\nShe\u2019s read, with skepticism, articles claiming that maintaining sex later in\nlife is healthy. \u201cIs it?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEmily feels their marriage has progressed naturally: They experienced decades\nof passion, and while they remain affectionate outside of the bedroom, their\nrelationship now transcends sex in many ways. It\u2019s about the life they\u2019ve\nbuilt together. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a sexless relationship for years now,\u201d Emily\nsays. \u201cWe get along great, but we\u2019re more like best buds than lovers.\u201d\n\nDespite their insistence that sex isn\u2019t essential in their marriages, most of\nthe couples I spoke with still keep track of how often they have sex. They\nalso appear haunted by how far they deviate from perceived norms. John, for\ninstance, hopes he and his wife can work back up to having sex two or three\ntimes a week, but admits he has no idea where that figure came from.\n\nNumbers, Nagoski believes, can be a counterproductive metric. It\u2019s impossible\nto hear such statistics and not judge one\u2019s relationship against them. Numbers\nalso don\u2019t account for whether participants are enjoying the sex they are\nhaving. \u201cYou\u2019re comparing yourself \u2014 you\u2019re judging yourself as OK or\ninadequate \u2014 compared to a whole bunch of people you\u2019re not having sex with,\nwho are not having sex with you,\u201d Nagoski says.\n\nFor couples measuring themselves against what Nagoski calls the \u201cfictions\u201d of\nsex, or for those worried that their relationship is on the line whenever they\nenter the bedroom or don\u2019t meet some monthly number, there may be too much\npressure for sex to be enjoyable. It\u2019s more important that couples establish\nwhat kind of sex is worth having.\n\n> ## \u2018There are people who tell you all the sex they\u2019re having. I feel like\n> it\u2019s a lot more common that a lot of people are not.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nRose admits to feeling the weight of societal expectations. Recently she\ndecided that since she and Will were rarely having sex, she would have her\nbirth-control implant removed from her arm. During the procedure, the nurse\nintimated there was something wrong with Rose\u2019s marriage. Rose felt shamed and\nangry. The idea that she should be living in a constant state of arousal with\nher husband after a decade together is, to her, ridiculous, but also part of a\nfacade she thinks many married couples maintain.\n\n\u201cThere are people who tell you all the sex they\u2019re having,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel\nlike it\u2019s a lot more common that a lot of people are not.\u201d With the help of\nher therapist, Rose is exploring whether her A.D.H.D. may play a role in her\nneed to seek new stimuli \u2014 not because she sees it as a problem but because\nshe is interested in understanding her desire more fully. \u201cApparently the\npartner fatigue I experience is not so uncommon because our \u2018special\u2019 brains\nare always seeking out what\u2019s new,\u201d she says.\n\nWill sometimes turns to Buddhist writings on restraint to explore his\nsexuality. He jokes there may be some confirmation bias at work, but he thinks\nhis wife\u2019s self-awareness \u2014 and her unwillingness to force herself into sex\nthat she doesn\u2019t want to have \u2014 has matured him. For Will, intimacy is less\nabout completion and more about connection. \u201cI\u2019ve learned, even just about the\nact of sex itself, the ending is not always the best part,\u201d Will says.\n\u201cThere\u2019s pleasure throughout the spectrum.\u201d\n\nIn March, for Rose\u2019s 40th birthday, they took a trip to Hawaii. She switched\noff her phone for hours as they sprawled out by the ocean. Will remembers\nturning toward his wife and staring at her, watching her relaxing, her body\nloose. In that moment, he wasn\u2019t thinking about sex or how beautiful Rose\nlooked under the sun. He was thinking about how similar they actually are.\nMore than anything, they want to enjoy themselves in their own way, to savor\nthe small moments when they can let the rest of the world fade away.\n\nAmanda Montei is the author of \u201cTouched Out: Motherhood, Misogyny, Consent and\nControl.\u201d She is based in California.\n\nRead by Julia Whelan\n\nNarration produced by Anna Diamond and Tanya P\u00e9rez\n\nEngineered by Joel Thibodeau\n\nA version of this article appears in print on April 21, 2024, Page 30 of the Sunday Magazine with the headline: An Intimate Absence.
