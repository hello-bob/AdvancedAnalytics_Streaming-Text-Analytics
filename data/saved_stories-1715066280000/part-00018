definitive control of the new Christian power, the Kingdom of\nPortugal.\n\nThe siege of Lisbon was one of the few Christian victories of the Second\nCrusade\u2014it was \"the only success of the universal operation undertaken by the\npilgrim army\", i.e., the Second Crusade, according to the near contemporary\nhistorian Helmold,^[2] although others have questioned whether it was really\npart of that crusade.^[3] It is seen as a pivotal battle of the wider\nReconquista.\n\nThe fall of Edessa in 1144 led to a call for a new crusade by Pope Eugene III\nin 1145 and 1146. In the spring of 1147, the Pope authorized the crusade in\nthe Iberian Peninsula. He also authorized Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile to\nequate his campaigns against the Moors with the rest of the Second Crusade. In\nMay 1147, a contingent of crusaders left from Dartmouth, Devon in the Kingdom\nof England. They had intended to sail directly to the Holy Land, but weather\nforced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast at the northern city of Porto\non 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with Afonso I of Portugal,\nwho had in 1139 declared himself king of the new Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nThe crusaders agreed to help the King attack Lisbon, with a solemn agreement\nthat offered to the crusaders the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom\nmoney for expected prisoners. The siege began on 1 July. The city of Lisbon at\nthe time of arrival consisted of sixty thousand families, including the\nrefugees who had fled Christian onslaught from neighbouring cities of Santar\u00e9m\nand others. Also reported by the De expugnatione Lyxbonensi is that the\ncitadel was holding 154,000 men, not counting women and children; as the\nmedieval account put it, after 17 weeks of siege \"the inhabitants were\ndespoiled and the city cleansed\".\n\nThe rulers of Lisbon agreed to surrender on 24 October, four months later,\nprimarily because of hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in\nthe newly-captured city, but some of the crusaders set sail and continued to\nthe Holy Land. Lisbon eventually became the capital city of the Kingdom of\nPortugal in 1255.\n\n## Second Crusade[edit]\n\nThe traditional start of the Reconquista is identified with the defeat of the\nMuslims in the Battle of Covadonga in 722.^[4] After the First Crusade in\n1095\u20131099, Pope Paschal II urged Iberian crusaders (Portuguese, Castilians,\nLeonese, Aragonese, and others) to remain at home, where their own warfare was\nconsidered just as worthy as that of crusaders travelling to Jerusalem.^[5]\n\nIn 1142, during the siege of Lisbon (1142), Afonso Henriques, taking advantage\nof the passage of a group of Anglo-Norman crusaders on their way to the Holy\nLand, attempted to use them to take the Muslim-ruled city of Lisbon. Although\nthis attempt ultimately failed leaving some distrust among the crusader\nforces, it showed the Portuguese monarch the usefulness of such force in\nfuture attempts.^[6]\n\nThe fall of Edessa in 1144 led to a call for a new crusade by Pope Eugene III\nin 1145 and 1146. In the spring of 1147, the Pope also authorized a crusade in\nthe Iberian peninsula, where \"the war against the Moors had been going on for\nhundreds of years.\"^[7] Pope Eugene encouraged Marseilles, Pisa, Genoa, and\nother Mediterranean cities to fight in Iberia. He also authorized Alfonso VII\nof Le\u00f3n and Castile to equate his campaigns against the Moors with the rest of\nthe Second Crusade.^[8]\n\nOn 19 May 1147, a contingent of crusaders left from Dartmouth in England,\nconsisting of crusaders from Flanders, Frisia, France, England, Scotland and\nsome German polities^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]^[1] who collectively considered\nthemselves \"Franks\".^[13] No prince or king was in charge of the expedition,\nand its participants seem to have been largely made up of townsmen, who\norganised themselves using a sworn oath.^[3] Leadership was provided by Hervey\nde Glanvill, Constable of Suffolk.^[14]^[15] Other crusader captains included\nArnout IV, Count of Aarschot leading the Rhinelanders, Christian of Gistel\nleading the Flemish and Boulogne forces, and the Anglo-Norman forces led by\nSimon of Dover, Andrew of London, and Saher of Archelle.^[16] Important\ndecisions were made collectively by the commanders.\n\n### Redirected efforts[edit]\n\nAfonso I of Portugal in a non-contemporary portrait\n\nAccording to Odo of Deuil there were 164 ships bound for the Holy Land, and\nthere may have been as many as 200 by the time they reached the Iberian shore.\nBad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern\ncity of Porto on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced by the bishop of\nPorto, Pedro II Pit\u00f5es, to meet with King Afonso. The king, who had reached\nthe Tagus and conquered Santar\u00e9m on 15 March, had also been negotiating with\nthe pope for the recognition of his title of King. He was notified of the\narrival of a first party and hastened to meet them.^[14]\n\nThe undisciplined multi-national group agreed to help him there, with a solemn\nagreement that offered to the crusaders the pillage of the city's goods and\nthe ransom money for expected prisoners. For the city, \"they shall have it and\nhold it until it has been searched and despoiled, both of prisoners for ransom\nand of everything else. Then, when it has been as thoroughly searched as they\nwish, they shall turn it over to me...\"^[17]\n\nKing Afonso promised to divide the conquered territories as fiefs among the\nleaders. He reserved the power of advocatus and released those who were at the\nsiege and their heirs trading in Portugal from the commercial tax called the\npedicata.\n\nThe English crusaders were at first unenthusiastic at this change of plan, but\nHervey de Glanville convinced them to participate.^[18] Some led by William\nViel and his brother, however, refused to take part^[clarification needed] on\naccount on an earlier joint attempt to capture Lisbon 1142. Hostages were\nexchanged as sureties for the oaths.^[14]\n\n### Fall of Lisbon[edit]\n\nThe Siege of Lisbon by D. Afonso Henriques by Joaquim Rodrigues Braga (1840):\na Romantic view\n\nThe siege began on 1 July. The Christians soon captured the surrounding\nterritories and besieged the walls of Lisbon itself. After four months, the\nrulers agreed to surrender on 21 October because the Crusaders' siege tower\nreached their wall (thus causing a one-day standstill) and because of hunger\nwithin the city, which was sheltering populations displaced from Santar\u00e9m as\nwell as \"the leading citizens of Sintra, Almada, and Palmela.\"^[19]\n\nAfter a brief riotous insurrection the Anglo-Norman chronicler attributes to\n\"the men of Cologne and the Flemings\",^[20] the city was entered by the\nChristian conquerors, on 25 October. The terms of the surrender indicated that\nthe Muslim garrison of the city would be allowed to keep their lives and\nproperty, but as soon as the Christians entered the city these terms were\nbroken.^[14] According to the De expugnatione Lyxbonensi,\n\n> The enemy, when they had been despoiled in the city, left the town through\n> three gates continuously from Saturday morning until the following\n> Wednesday. There was such a multitude of people that it seemed as if all of\n> Hispania were mingled in the crowd.^[17]\n\nFurthermore, according to the De expugnatione Lyxbonensi, the Flemish and\nthose from Cologne were the ones who broke their oath but even according to\nthis they were more concerned with plundering than killing any of the\ninhabitants:\n\n> They ran hither and yon. They plundered. They broke down doors. They\n> rummaged through the interior of every house. They drove the citizens away\n> and harassed them improperly and unjustly. They destroyed clothes and\n> utensils. They treated virgins shamefully. They acted as if right and wrong\n> were the same. They secretly took away everything which should have been\n> common property. They even cut the throat of the elderly Bishop of the city,\n> slaying him against all right and justice. ... The Normans and the English,\n> however, for whom faith and religion were of the greatest importance,\n> contemplating what such actions might lead to, remained quietly in their\n> assigned position, preferring to stay their hands from looting rather than\n> to violate the obligations of their faith and their oathbound\n> association.^[21]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nSome of the crusaders set sail and continued on their journey around the\nIberian Peninsula and were invited by Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona to\nhelp him capture the city of Tortosa on the Ebro.^[14] However, most of the\ncrusaders settled in the newly captured city, thus boosting the number of\nChristian supporters in Iberia.\n\nGilbert of Hastings was elected bishop marking the beginning of the historic\nrelationship between England and Portugal which would later form the Anglo-\nPortuguese Alliance.\n\nIn spite of the contractual nature of the city's surrender, a legend arose\nthat the Portuguese warrior and nobleman, Martim Moniz, sacrificed himself in\norder to keep the city doors open to the conquering Christian armies.^[22]\n\nLisbon eventually became the capital city of the Kingdom of Portugal in 1255.\nThe victory was a turning-point in the history of Portugal and the wider\nReconquista, which would be completed in 1492.^[23]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Christianity portal\n\n  * Saint George's Castle\n  * Portugal in the Middle Ages\n  * Timeline of Portuguese history\n  * De expugnatione Lyxbonensi, a contemporary eye-witness account.\n  * The History of the Siege of Lisbon, a modern novel about the siege and of the unreliability of historical memory.\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b H.
