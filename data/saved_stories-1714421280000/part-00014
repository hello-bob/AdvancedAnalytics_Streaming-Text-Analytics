This afternoon, a car radio in Roslindale tuned to 89.3 only picked up a\nRhode Island NPR station.\n\nLast year, the FCC set a minimum fine of $20,000 for pirate radio operators,\nbut said Marius was more than deserving of a whopping increase, in part\nbecause he's been warned - and fined - by the commission before:\n\n> First, we find that Marius's conduct was intentional. Marius had been warned\n> multiple times since 2004 that his conduct was illegal, including a\n> forfeiture order issued against him, but he nonetheless chose to continue to\n> operate without authorization. Second, we find that an upward adjustment is\n> warranted based on Marius's history of prior violations of the Act observed\n> by Agents in 2004 and 2017. Last, we find that Marius's broadcasting on two\n> separate frequencies and from three different geographic areas was egregious\n> as it significantly increased the likelihood of interference to lawfully\n> operating stations and the potential for harm to the public if such stations\n> needed to transmit emergency alerts.\n\nMarius, who lives in Randolph, has 30 days to appeal the proposed fine.\n\nNeighborhoods:\n\nMattapan\n\nFree tagging:\n\npirate radio\n\nAttachment| Size  \n---|---  \nAttachment| Size  \n---|---  \nComplete FCC report| 473.43 KB  \n  \n  * facebook\n  * twitter\n  * email\n  * print\n\n  * Reply\n\nAd:\n\nLike the job UHub is doing?

Local range stations - like almost all FM\nstations - should be locally owned.\n\nup\n\n45\n\n  * reply\n\n### I understand the need to be\n\nBy anon on Sat, 04/27/2024 - 2:50pm.\n\nI understand the need to be careful stewards of the EM band, but I don\u2019t think\nthe community is better off having this station down. He should have been\nbrought in, not locked out.\n\nup\n\n27\n\n  * reply\n\n### Yes, they should be...\n\nBy necturus on Sat, 04/27/2024 - 2:58pm.\n\n...and they used to be. But then Ronald Reagan came along, and rules which\nlimited owners to no more than seven AMs, seven FMs, and seven TV stations\nwere repealed, paving the way for the rise of Iheart, Cumulus, and Beasley,\nthe three companies that now own almost all radio stations in the Boston\nmarket except the non-commercial FMs.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin of local radio was hammered home by Bill Clinton\nwhen he signed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which among other things,\nmandated that all vacant channels be auctioned off to the highest bidder.\nClinton and Reagan are responsible for the current media landscape, one of\nwhose consequences is the deep political divide in our country.\n\nThe only remaining locally owned full power (\"Class B\") commercial FMs in the\nBoston market are WPLM 99.1 and WXRV 92.5. There's also one medium power\n(\"Class A\") station with a commercial license: WHRB 95.3, which is owned by a\nstudent organization at Harvard.\n\nup\n\n42\n\n  * reply\n\n### You fired me up\n\nBy Plen-T-Pak on Sat, 04/27/2024 - 7:25pm.\n\nYou're right. Coincidentally I was just reading about low power FM and how\nit's completely legal. Broadcast range varies widely but can range up to a\nmile. If a scattering of people all cooperated and played the same stuff, all\nsynced up via internet, then you'd have a distributed broadcast system. Who's\nin? Transmitter is around $100, but maybe we can get a bulk deal.\n\nJust yesterday I was reading about some dude down in Montclair New Jersey\nwho's been broadcasting \"I'll Make Love To You\" by Boyz II Men on repeat for\n13 years. His broadcast reaches a couple blocks.\n\nhttps://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/lpfm\n\nup\n\n14\n\n  * reply\n\n### One Watt\n\nBy BostonDog on Sat, 04/27/2024 - 11:45pm.\n\nUp to a mile only in ideal conditions, free of obstruction and other\ninterference. Even with a good transmission location, the signal won't go far.\nThe hardware is cheap. They used to sell small FM transmitters for people to\nuse in the car as a way of connecting their MP3 player to the stereo before\ncars came standard with Aux-In jacks and Bluetooth. (Mostly used in the\nClinton years when cars stopped having cassette players but before MP3 players\nbecame a thing.)\n\nThe problem with pirate radio is that the unlicensed people use the same\nfrequencies as the non-commercial stations. So they end up knocking the best\nlegitimate broadcasters off the air. It's not as if they are replacing Clear\nChannel.\n\nup\n\n10\n\n  * reply\n\n### 100W is the limit\n\nBy Plen-T-Pak on Sun, 04/28/2024 - 9:24am.\n\nUp to 12 miles under ideal conditions.\n\nup\n\n2\n\n  * reply\n\n### LPFM requires a license\n\nBy BostonDog on Sun, 04/28/2024 - 11:42am.\n\nAnd there aren't any currently available in Boston.\n\nWhat's know as \"Part-15\" is legal unlicensed FM transmission. That's limited\nto a watt.\n\nup\n\n1\n\n  * reply\n\n### That's 100% illegal\n\nBy Aaron Read on Sun, 04/28/2024 - 12:52am.\n\nThe only legal way to broadcast to FM in the USA is to meet the power\nrestrictions of 47 CFR Part 15, which is 250 microvolts/meter measured at 3\nmeters from the radiating antenna. That's TINY. On a good day it MIGHT reach\n100ft. Not miles, FEET.\n\nBy contrast, a licensed 47 CFR Part 73 Class A 6kW FM station is 1\nmillivolt/meter measured at 28.3km. To put these in the same units of\nmeasurement:\n\n  * Part 15 = 250 microvolts per meter, at 0.003 km\n  * Part 73 = 10,000 microvolts per meter, at 28.3 km\n\nAlso the LEGAL transmitters cost a lot more than $100/ea. You might see FM\ntransmitters on eBay for that little (maybe) but you'll notice that every\nsingle one of them is sold from an overseas location, usually China. That's\nbecause every single one of them is 100% illegal for use in the United States.\n\nOh, and if you're referring to the actual Class LPFM license (47 CFR Part\n73.801 to 73.881) those are licensed at 100w referenced to 30m Height Above\nAverage Terrain. To compare to the items above, it's 10,000 microvolts per\nmeter (aka 1 millvolt/meter) measured at 5.6km. These many only be applied for\nduring filing windows that typically open once every 10 to 15 years, and the\nlast one was December 2023. They must protect all existing facilities and I'd\nwager that if there were room for any new ones in Boston before the last\nwindow, there sure aren't now. And it'd be 100% illegal for them all be\nbroadcasting the same content; they cannot repeat another licensed station's\nbroadcast.\n\nup\n\n8\n\n  * reply\n\n### Oh please don't take a dump\n\nBy Plen-T-Pak on Sun, 04/28/2024 - 5:34pm.\n\nOh please don't take a dump all over my dreams, man. :)\n\nThanks for the info! I appreciate you taking the time to explain it.\n\nup\n\n3\n\n  * reply\n\n### It's almost impossible to find these people\n\nBy necturus on Sat, 04/27/2024 - 2:50pm.\n\nThey'll put a transmitter on the roof of a building far from their actual\nstudios and feed it via the Internet. When the FCC comes knocking, they ask\nwhoever answers the door to turn it off,which they do. Then the pirate comes,\ncollects his equipment, sets it up at another location, and turns it back on.\nLather, rinse, repeat.\n\nLately, the FCC has been going after landlords on whose property they find\nillegal transmitters. But the FCC is underfunded, doesn't have enough\nenforcement people, and has no powers of arrest.\n\nMy suggestion has always been that the state should pass a law, not against\nradio piracy, which is a federal matter, but targeting advertisers who use\nillegal stations. The law should be in the form of a whopping big tax, with\nthe goal of making pirate radio an uneconomical choice for the advertisers. No\nadvertisers, no pirate stations.\n\nup\n\n6\n\n  * reply\n\n### Landlords = Property Taxes\n\nBy Aaron Read on Sun, 04/28/2024 - 12:57am.\n\nThe FCC going after the landlords, as the PIRATE Act gave them authority to\ndo, was a stroke of genius precisely because it avoid the problem of FCC not\nhaving statutory authority to arrest pirates and/or seize equipment. (only the\nUS Marshalls can do that, and they're understaffed as it is with better things\nto be doing)\n\nWhen you're a property owner, and you have an outstanding federal forfeiture\nagainst your property, guess what you cannot do? That's right: pay/settle your\nannual property tax bill. Stop paying your property taxes, guess what happens?\nThat's right: the local government comes after you. Local police, local\ncourts, local arrests and seizures to settle the tax debt.\n\nWorse, Massachusetts still has the legal authority (although not for long,\nthanks to recent court rulings) to seize ALL your property on a parcel with an\noutstanding tax bill, just to settle the debt. Regardless of how much more the\nproperty is worth than the bill.\n\nIt'll take a year or two to really take effect, but these FCC forfeitures will\nhave real teeth in them before much longer. Marius is about to learn this the\nhard way, as is anyone who's ever allowed him to broadcast from their\nproperty.\n\nup\n\n  * reply\n\n### what is \"radio\"?\n\nBy anon on Sat, 04/27/2024 - 3:07pm.\n\nwhat is \"radio\"?\n\nup\n\n16\n\n  * reply\n\n### It's the sound\n\nBy SamWack on Sun, 04/28/2024 - 4:26pm.\n\nof a brand-new world.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqmohLGzWis\n\nup\n\n2\n\n  * reply\n\n### Was he transmitting from\n\nBy Don't Panic on Sun, 04/28/2024 - 2:04am.\n\nWas he transmitting from Woolson Street or nearby? I remember a huge radio\ntower looming up in that residential area. I didn't think that much about it\nbecause we had huge satellite receivers in that part of the neighborhood back\nin the day.\n\nThe tower messed with my cable.

Apparently not.\n\nAs an aside, we live in 2024 not 1985. It's easy to create media to local\ncommunity in the Internet, accessed with a smartphone which vast majority of\npeople, including American Haitians, Haitians from Haiti, etc , own\n\nup\n\n2\n\n  * reply\n\n### Not gonna lie, I find this\n\nBy anon on Sun, 04/28/2024 - 12:28pm.\n\nNot gonna lie, I find this extremely interesting and cool. I hope they drop\nthe charges as it\u2019s a non violence crime. Maybe just hit him with a\nmisdemeanor. The percentage of people who are ACTUALLY willing and able to set\nup and operate pirate radio is wager is very very very low. There\u2019s no need to\nmake example of this guy.\n\nup\n\n4\n\n  * reply\n\n### It's about intererence\n\nBy necturus on Sun, 04/28/2024 - 5:26pm.\n\nThese pirates interfere with the reception of other stations. The FCC rules\nexist for a reason: to manage a scarce resource -- radio spectrum -- in the\npublic interest.\n\nAnyone is free to \"broadcast\" on the Internet. There is room for an infinite\nnumber of stations there. But there's only so much room on the FM dial, and\nsomeone has to be the judge of who gets to use the channel space. Otherwise it\nwill end up like CB radio in the 1970s, where millions of 5-watt transmitters\nproduced a cacaphony of noise.\n\nIronically, there's now a vacant channel on the Boston AM band. The license of\nWZBR 1410 AM expired recently after its owner died and the station failed to\nget back on the air within a year. The AM band is perfectly good, but it's\nlost popularity primarily because most AM stations broadcast content of little\ninterest -- typically angry right wing politics or Bible-thumping.\n\nup\n\n3\n\n  * reply\n\n## Support Universal Hub\n\nHelp keep Universal Hub going.
