A repeat performance\nin 2024 may not be as easy, but it is possible.\n\nBy Nick Bunker\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nKey Points:\n\n  * Next year\u2019s outlook will depend not only on the direction of demand for workers, but also on whether any future declines are coming primarily through less hiring, rather than more layoffs.\n  * More prime-age workers may continue to join the labor force if the labor market remains tight and immigration flows stay high. But don\u2019t expect these forces to hold off the shrinking effects of an aging population forever.\n  * Workers are quitting less frequently than a few years ago, but job-switching is still elevated by historical standards.\n  * Wage growth increasingly looks like it\u2019s on track to return to a pre-pandemic pace. But it\u2019s unclear how long that return will take and whether inflation will follow a similar trajectory.\n  * Increased usage of GenAI and other technologies \u2014 in addition to an increase in jobs developing those tools \u2014 could reshape the broader labor market. Watch for the use of Generative AI in jobs that don\u2019t create AI.\n\nThe labor market didn\u2019t follow the script many people wrote for it this year.\nLet\u2019s all be thankful for that. Despite many projections for a recession, a\nhistorically fast tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, a\nbanking crisis, and geopolitical crises and uncertainty, the labor market\nstands strong. Getting to this spot required a few unexpected things to\nhappen.\n\nJob openings and job postings fell considerably, but layoffs stayed low.\nWorkers came flooding back into the labor force, and employers continued\nhiring at a solid clip, but wage growth slowed. The so-called \u201cGreat\nResignation\u201d that marked the early post-pandemic years ended, but workers\nstill felt comfortable leaving their jobs. A host of new artificial\nintelligence tools were introduced that threaten to upend how many workers do\ntheir jobs, but there\u2019s no immediate sign of it displacing workers.\n\nBut past performance is no guarantee of future results. Everything that needed\nto go right for the labor market in 2023 largely has. For next year to end on\na similar high note, a few trends need to hold up or accelerate in 2024:\n\n  * Demand for workers will need to stay strong, either because job postings hold firm or employers hoard workers despite weak hiring plans.\n  * More prime-age workers will need to enter the workforce to counteract the long-term drag of an aging population.\n  * Quitting will need to stick at its current pace, a level consistent with what we saw before the pandemic but still elevated by historical standards.\n  * Nominal wage growth will need to continue to come down to ease concerns about the labor market fueling inflation. But for workers to keep adding to their purchasing power, wage growth cannot fall below the rate of inflation.\n  * Generative AI tools may spread rapidly through the economy and boost productivity growth.\n\nThis report digs into these broad trends. Following them will help us navigate\nnext year\u2019s path. Fingers crossed, the trail doesn\u2019t take any detours.\n\n## Demand for workers has moderated, but further reductions could be more\ntroubling.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cIndeed Job Postings Index\u201d with a vertical axis spanning\nfrom 40 to 160. The index is set so the daily number of job postings on\nFebruary 1, 2020, is equal to 100. The index declined for much of 2022 and\nearly 2023, but its descent has moderated in recent months.\n\nEmployers\u2019 hiring appetites are no longer as ravenous as a few years ago. As\nof early November, the Indeed Job Postings Index is down 22.5% from its\nDecember 31, 2021 peak, and the federal government\u2019s job openings number is\ndown 20.6% from its March 2022 high as of September. Part of the decline in\nthese measures is because employers have been able to fill many positions. As\nof October, total employment was 3% above its February 2020 pre-pandemic peak.\n\nA table with the title \u201cSectors with the sharpest declines in job postings\u201d\nshows the year-over-year change in the Job Postings Index for different\noccupational sectors. The largest decline is for Software Development job\npostings, down 51%.\n\nAt the same time, many employers have rethought their staffing plans in light\nof slowing economic growth, shifting consumer demand, and higher interest\nrates. The pullback in job postings has been most stark in sectors tied to\npreviously high-flying industries, including tech, where stock valuations have\nfallen and hiring plans have returned to earth. Sectors connected to companies\nthat provide in-person services, including restaurants, hotels, and hospitals,\nrepresent a continued source of robust hiring demand.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cPostings are most resilient in sectors most likely to be\nin person\u201d shows trends in the Indeed Job Postings Index by remote work tier.\nSectors more likely to advertise remote work have seen job postings slip more\nsince 2022.\n\nThe divergence in hiring outlooks can be seen in the different trends for jobs\ndepending on whether they need staff to be in person. While job postings are\ndown overall, postings in sectors with the highest shares of roles that can be\ndone remotely have fallen the most \u2014 essentially back to pre-pandemic levels.\nJob postings for the sectors most likely to require in-person work have\nactually increased since mid-year, up 3.1% from June 16th to November 3rd,\nwhile overall postings were down 1% over the same period. The continued\nresilience of hiring in these sectors depends on continued strong consumer\nspending for in-person services which flows through to desired hiring.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cLayoffs remain low by historical standards\u201d shows the\nlayoffs and discharges rate from January 2019 to September 2023. The vertical\naxis spans from 0.9% to 1.8%. The current layoff rate of 1% remains below the\nlowest layoff rate prior to the pandemic.\n\nAnd while employers may be less enthusiastic about adding more workers to\ntheir payrolls, they seem content to keep the workers they already have \u2014\nfalling demand for workers overall is coming primarily through less demand for\nnew workers. After a brief rise early in the year, the overall layoff rate as\nof September was just 1%, a level that would have represented a record low\nbefore the pandemic. There has been a dramatic decline in layoffs over the\ncourse of the year in a handful of industries, including Retail Trade. In\nFebruary 2020, just prior to the onset of the pandemic, the layoff rate for\nthe Retail Trade sector was 1.9%. By September 2023, the latest available\ndata, the layoff rate in Retail had essentially halved, to just 0.9%.\n\nNext year\u2019s outlook will depend not only on the direction of demand for\nworkers \u2014 whether it continues to fall or not \u2014 but also on the means through\nwhich employers reduce that demand. If demand for new hires continues cooling\nat roughly the same gradual pace as it has throughout 2023, then the labor\nmarket can be expected to continue on its current path without a spike in\nunemployment. But while postings and openings remain elevated relative to\nhistoric norms, they are still at a much lower level than recent highs. A\nfurther, rapid descent from these lower levels could mean that fewer currently\nunemployed workers are getting hired, leading to a rise in unemployment.\n\nAnd a prolonged contraction in overall demand for workers could also mean that\nemployers would start to shed current workers and layoffs would start to\nmount. Job postings and job openings could fall even more without a large rise\nin unemployment if employers hoard labor, as many have hypothesized. But\nthat\u2019s uncharted territory for the US labor market. Keeping an eye on not just\nthe growth of job postings and openings, but the level as well, will be\nimportant next year.\n\n## The labor force is growing, but it can\u2019t defy demographic gravity forever\n\nMost predictions about the future are difficult, but some are relatively easy.\nWithout a tremendous surge in immigration in the next few years, the United\nStates will continue to age. According to projections from the Congressional\nBudget Office, the share of the working-age population 65 and above will grow\nfrom 17.5% in 2023, to 20.9% in 2035. An aging population means the pool of\navailable workers will shrink in the years to come.\n\nBut over the past year, the labor force has defied these dynamics and grown\nquite quickly. The US labor force grew by an average of 276,000 people per\nmonth through the first 10 months of the year \u2014 faster than both the 2021\nmonthly average of 98,000 workers and the average of 131,000 in the three\nyears prior to the pandemic. If the long-term trend is toward a slower-growing\nlabor force, how was 2023 such a strong year?\n\nA bar chart titled \u201cThe labor force is growing rapidly in 2023\u201d shows average\nmonthly labor force growth during the first 10 months of the year. The chart\nshows data for 2023 (an average of 276,000 per month, 2022 (224,000 per\nmonth), and 2021 (98,000 per month.) It also shows a line for the average pace\nfrom 2017 through 2019: 131,000 per month.\n\nIn short, the participation rate of prime-age workers, those aged 25-to-54,\nrose to levels not seen since the early 2000s. As of October, the\nparticipation rate for these workers was 83.3%, down from a recent peak of\n83.5% the month prior, but still comparable to rates twenty years ago.\nConsistently high demand for workers has both pulled more people into the\nlabor force, and kept more current participants attached to the job market. A\nrebound in immigration from depressed pandemic-era flows has boosted prime-age\nparticipation as well. Even though foreign-born workers were just 18% of the\nlabor force a year ago, roughly a fourth of the growth in the labor force over\nthe past year has come from foreign-born workers. Short-term strength has\nmanaged to push back against the long-term trend. At least for now.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much longer these short-term boosts to the labor force can\ncontinue. While 25-54-year-olds are participating at a rate in the range of\nwhat we saw twenty years ago, the current prime-age labor force participation\nrate is still short of its all-time high of 84.6% reached in January 1999.\nEven if participation among prime-age workers rose to match that high, and\nmore workers aged 65+ pushed their participation rates to all-time highs, the\nlabor force participation rate would only slightly increase next year, and\nthen stabilize in 2025. After that, the weight of demographics would take\nover, and the participation rate would start to drop.\n\nA bar chart titled \u201cAn aging population will eventually pull down the US labor\nforce participation rate.\u201d The chart shows labor force participation rates for\n2018 through 2023 and then projected labor force participation rates under a\nscenario laid out in the text of the report.\n\nOne way to counteract this seemingly inevitable slide could be through\nincreased immigration, which may continue to be a meaningful source of workers\nin the next few years, but likely not a growing one. Foreign interest in job\npostings on Indeed has picked up since the pandemic and is well above 2019\nlevels. About 4% of clicks on job postings in the US came from outside the\ncountry in September 2023, up from roughly 2% four years prior. However,\nforeign interest seemingly plateaued over the past year. If interest from job\nseekers outside the US is any indication, immigration is unlikely to\naccelerate next year and provide a larger boost to the labor force.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cForeign job seeker interest has increased\u201d shows the\nshare of clicks on US job postings from outside the US. The share has\nincreased from 2018 and 2019 levels of roughly 2% and now stands at a bit more\nthan 4%.\n\nReplicating the strong labor force growth of the past year will be difficult,\nbut continued strong demand for workers, and robust immigration, may offer a\ntemporary reprieve from the long-term trend. Because so many Americans have\nsimply aged into retirement over the past few years, and with many more behind\nthem in the years to come, overall labor supply will remain more limited than\nit was pre-pandemic \u2014 though it will still respond to a strong labor market.\nThe currently resilient labor market might test the bounds of how much further\nparticipation rates can rise for some workers, but it can\u2019t defy the gravity\nof demographics forever.\n\n## The Great Resignation is behind us, but that doesn\u2019t mean workers aren\u2019t\nquitting their jobs\n\nAs we head toward the end of 2023, it\u2019s clear that workers just aren\u2019t\nquitting like they used to, at least compared to the rates in late 2021 and\n2022. The immediate post-pandemic surge in workers voluntarily leaving their\njobs was so sudden and remarkable it was deemed the \u201cGreat Resignation.\u201d Job\nopportunities were proliferating and competition for workers was fierce. While\nthe data on quitting can\u2019t tell us where workers end up after they leave their\njobs, other data from the federal government can. Those data show the Great\nResignation was a period of elevated job switching.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cQuits rates and job-switching rates tend to move\ntogether\u201d covers data from the first quarter of 2001 to the third quarter of\n2023.\n\nThose days, at least as we knew them, are behind us. The quits rate stood at\n2.3% in September, the latest available data, equal to the average rate in\n2019. This slowdown in quitting is mainly attributable to declining employer\ndemand for new hires in early 2022. But another feature of the Great\nResignation period was that workers were leaving their jobs at high rates\nwhile the overall unemployment rate was still elevated following pandemic-\nrelated disruptions.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cQuitting is still strong by historical standards.\u201d The\ngraph covers data from January 2001 to September 2023. The most recent data\nshow the quits rate is equal to where it was in 2019 and that this level is\nstrong by historical standards.\n\nGenerally, workers feel more comfortable quitting when unemployment is low and\ntheir confidence in finding another job is high \u2014 the typical relationship\nshows that when unemployment is high, quitting is low, and vice versa. And\nwhen unemployment is high, you\u2019d expect it to be unemployed workers filling\nopen job roles rather than those currently holding a job. But during 2021, the\nquits rate rose much faster than one might expect given the unemployment rate.\nIt looked as though more hires were coming from the ranks of the already-\nemployed, rather than the unemployed.\n\nBut the relationship between quitting and the unemployment rate has since\nshifted back to its pre-pandemic pattern. The quits rate in September was\nroughly in line with what may have been predicted pre-pandemic if the\nunemployment rate was 3.8%, as it was in September. That reconnection can be\nseen in the graph below, in which the quits rate and the unemployment rates\nfor January 2020 and September 2023 are very close to each other. The\npandemic-era disconnect between the job-finding outlook for the employed and\nthe unemployed has disappeared. The result is that quitting has declined\nwithout a corresponding rise in the unemployment rate.\n\nA graph titled \u201cThe relationship between quitting and unemployment is back to\nits pre-pandemic status\u201d shows data on the unemployment rate and the quits\nrate.\n\nHowever, a return to the 2019-era quits rate doesn\u2019t mean workers are suddenly\nwithout opportunities to find new jobs, or that employers don\u2019t need to worry\nabout retaining current workers. Before the Great Resignation, the all-time\nhigh quits rate was 2.4% \u2014 just barely above the current level of 2.3% \u2014 a\nsign that workers are still job-switching at near-historic rates. And even if\nthe overall quits rate falls further to levels more in line with historical\naverages, individual industries and sectors may see more churn, and more\nworkers looking to leave. For example, quitting in Leisure and Hospitality\nremains above its pre-pandemic rate, while the quits rate for Professional and\nBusiness Services stands below its February 2020 level.\n\nA chart titled \u201cQuits rate by industry sector\u201d shows the quits rate for a\nvariety of industry sectors in September 2023 and February 2020. Most sectors\nhad a quits rate in September very similar to their pre-pandemic rate, with a\nfew exceptions.\n\nJob seekers are increasingly shifting their interest to job postings outside\ntheir current field, according to Indeed data. For example, the share of civil\nengineers looking at job postings outside of their field has grown by almost 9\npercentage points since 2019 \u2014 from almost 77% in 2019 to more than 85%\ncurrently. If a growing share of workers in some fields are looking to leave\nthose roles without an offsetting rise in interest from other fields,\nemployers would need to take steps to retain current employees. Such steps\ncould include pay hikes, increases in benefits, or changes in workplace\nflexibility, among others.\n\nA table titled \u201cSectors with the largest jump in workers looking to leave\ntheir field since 2019.\u201d The table shows data on the rates at which job\nseekers are clicking on job postings in sectors which different from their\ncurrent occupation.\n\n## Wage growth looks to be settling down \u2014 hopefully, inflation will follow\n\nOne of the most apparent signs of the ongoing US labor market cooldown is that\nwages are no longer growing as quickly as they recently were. Falling employer\ndemand, increasing labor supply, and diminished quitting has resulted in\nemployers handing out smaller raises. This slowdown in wage growth can be seen\nin a variety of measures of wage growth, including the Indeed Wage Tracker and\nthose from the federal government. The Indeed Wage Tracker peaked first \u2014 in\nJanuary 2022 \u2014 and the Atlanta Fed\u2019s Wage Growth Tracker peaked last, in early\n2023.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cA quartet of wage growth metrics\u201d shows year-over-year\nwage growth for four measures of wage growth. All four measures show wage\ngrowth moderating in 2023.\n\nWhile wage growth has slowed by several measures, it hasn\u2019t yet returned to\nits pre-pandemic growth pace. But there are indications it may fall to that\nlevel relatively soon. According to the latest data from the Indeed Wage\nTracker, posted wages in October were up 4.2% from a year prior, down from\n4.8% in July, and well below the January 2022 peak of 9.3%. If posted wages\ncontinue to slow down at roughly the rate they have for the past three months,\nthe Indeed Wage Tracker will return to its pre-pandemic pace before the middle\nof next year.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cUS posted wages are slowing considerably\u201d with a vertical\naxis from 0% to 10%. The graph covers from January 2019 to October 2023. It\nshows posted wage growth rising quickly through most of 2021 before peaking in\nJanuary 2022 and declining through October 2023.\n\nWage growth seems on a track back to the healthy and sustainable rate seen\nbefore the pandemic. Wage growth between 3.5% to 4% would be consistent with\n2% inflation, assuming labor productivity grows between 1.5% and 2% annually.\nLabor productivity is up 2.2% over the past year, but the underlying pace\nmight be lower than that moving forward.\n\nNote that the data above is nominal and does not account for inflation.\nConsumer prices were up 3.2% year-over-year in October, above both pre-\npandemic norms and the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. By most measures, wages\nare currently growing slightly faster than the rate of inflation, meaning\nworkers\u2019 purchasing power is actually showing a modest increase. But if\nnominal wages continue to decelerate, inflation will also have to slow further\nfor workers to keep receiving these inflation-adjusted raises.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cPosted wages are growing faster than prices\u201d covers data\nfrom January 2019 to October 2023. The graph compares year-over-year growth in\nthe Consumer Price Index versus the Indeed Wage Tracker.\n\nThe inflation outlook is hotly debated. Whether and how quickly it returns to\nthe desired 2% annual rate depends on many factors including the effects of\nmonetary policy, changing consumer behaviors, the stability of inflation\nexpectations, and, of course, the state of the labor market. If wage growth\nstays higher for longer it could impede inflation\u2019s fall. When, as recently as\na year or two ago, wages were growing at double or more their pre-pandemic\npace, many feared that inflation would also remain high. Slowing wage growth\nhas soothed some of those fears, at least for the moment, but both wages and\nprices will need to continue to slow to put those concerns fully to rest.\n\nWhile wage growth might be slowing down, employers could be finding other ways\nto attract job seekers that are less costly. As Hiring Lab has documented,\nsalary transparency has become increasingly common in the US, due in part to a\nrise in local regulations. But employers might also find that advertising what\nthey pay could be a competitive necessity in a still-tight labor market. Wages\nmight not grow as quickly next year, but employers that advertise what they\u2019re\npaying may find it somewhat easier to attract quality candidates than their\ncompetition, which may keep salary information more opaque.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cOver half of jobs on Indeed now include salary information\u201d\nwith a vertical axis ranging from 20% to 50%. Indeed tracked the percentage\nshare of US job postings containing employer-provided salary information\nmonthly from January 2019 to October 2023. The chart shows that the share has\nincreased since early 2020, and reached a series high of 53% in October 2023.\n\n## Watch for the usage of Generative AI in jobs that don\u2019t create AI\n\nArtificial intelligence, particularly generative artificial intelligence,\nrocketed into public consciousness at the end of 2022. These technologies have\ngreat potential to reconfigure a wide variety of jobs, and potentially create\nmany more new jobs. The impacts will likely be felt widely but unevenly, with\nsome occupational sectors \u2014 including Software Development \u2014 highly exposed to\nGenerativeAI, while others \u2014 including Driving \u2014 will feel fewer direct\nimpacts. Even so, regardless of intensity, those effects will take some time\nto play out.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait to see the long-term effects of GenAI, but it\u2019s clear right\nnow that jobs related to the field are surging. At the beginning of 2023,\n0.003% of job postings mentioned terms related to Generative AI. This share\nstood at 0.06% by the end of October, a 20 times increase. Of course, only 6\nin 10,000 job postings means Generative AI jobs aren\u2019t very common, even if\nthey are growing rapidly. Our measure not only captures jobs that create\nGenerative AI tools, but it also accounts for postings that mention if the\nrole will use a GenAI tool. Marketing jobs are a good example \u2014 while most\nMarketers aren\u2019t actively creating AI tools, they are certainly using them in\ntheir work, and showing up in our tracker as a result.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cPercentage (%) of job postings containing GenAI terms.\u201d\nWith a vertical axis ranging from 0.00 to 0.06, and a horizontal axis ranging\nfrom January 2020 to October 2023, the graph shows the percentage of job\npostings containing GenAI terms, and the recent rise of that percentage.\n\nIncreased usage of GenAI and other technologies \u2014 in addition to an increase\nin jobs developing those tools \u2014 could reshape the broader labor market. GenAI\njobs might increase in the years ahead, but if the growth comes primarily from\nthose jobs that create the tools, without corresponding growth in roles that\nsimply use these tools, the economic impact of AI and GenAI could be small.\nFor example, the power of personal computing didn\u2019t become apparent until it\nwas used in a mass capacity, not just in a few technology and research\ncompanies. So when it comes to GenAI jobs moving forward, we\u2019ll be sure to\ntrack the overall level and the occupational sectors leading the way.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn many ways, these first few post-pandemic years are uncharted territory.\nMore evidence emerges daily that our economic maps and contingency plans may\nbe outdated and insufficient to guide us on what comes next. So far, the labor\nmarket has shown that a high-demand environment and tight labor supply need\nnot be permanently inflationary. Wage growth can slow without a spike in\nunemployment. Workers who left the labor market can be drawn back. The\noptimistic view of the market may actually be the correct view.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that we are entering a period in which the easiest hurdles\non the road to a soft landing have already been cleared, leaving only the\nhighest and most difficult for the last mile of the race. That the labor\nmarket\u2019s journey to this point has been relatively painless does not guarantee\nthat actual pain is not coming. The full effects of the past 20 months of\ntightened monetary policy may be ahead of us, and things may slow further, as\nis widely expected. And if conditions do not continue to cool as expected,\nthen the Federal Reserve may feel it has no choice but to tighten the screws\neven further, forcing a more immediate slowdown in place of the only gradual\none we\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nThere\u2019s a case for optimism for 2024, but it\u2019s best not to oversell it.\n\nMethodology\n\nData on seasonally adjusted Indeed job postings are an index of the number of\nseasonally adjusted job postings on a given day, using a seven-day trailing\naverage. February 1, 2020, is our pre-pandemic baseline, so the index is set\nto 100 on that day. We seasonally adjust each series based on historical\npatterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. We adopted this methodology in January 2021.\nData for several dates in 2021 and 2022 are missing and were interpolated.\nNon-seasonally adjusted data are calculated in a similar manner except that\nthe data are not adjusted to historical patterns.\n\nThe number of job postings on Indeed.com, whether related to paid or unpaid\njob solicitations, is not indicative of potential revenue or earnings of\nIndeed, which comprises a significant percentage of the HR Technology segment\nof its parent company, Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. Job posting numbers are\nprovided for information purposes only and should not be viewed as an\nindicator of the performance of Indeed or Recruit. Please refer to the Recruit\nHoldings investor relations website and regulatory filings in Japan for more\ndetailed information on revenue generation by Recruit\u2019s HR Technology segment.\n\nTo calculate the average rate of wage growth, we follow an approach similar to\nthe Atlanta Fed US Wage Growth Tracker, but we track jobs, not individuals. We\nbegin by calculating the median posted wage for a given country, month, job\ntitle, region, and salary type (hourly, monthly, or annual). Within each\ncountry, we then calculate year-on-year wage growth for each job title-region-\nsalary type combination, generating a monthly distribution. Our monthly\nmeasure of wage growth for the country is the median of that distribution.\nAlternative methodologies, such as the regression-based approaches in\nMarinescu & Wolthoff (2020) and Haefke et al. (2013), produce similar trends.\nMore information about the data and methodology is available in a research\npaper by Pawel Adrjan and Reamonn Lydon, Wage growth in Europe: evidence from\njob ads, published in the Central Bank of Ireland\u2019s Economic Letter series.\n\nThe analysis of Generative AI job postings involved extracting job postings\ndirectly related to Generative AI, using specific keywords indicating its\npresence, such as \u201cGenerative AI,\u201d \u201cLarge Language Models,\u201d and \u201cChat GPT.\u201d\n\nWe assess foreign job seeker interest in the US by tracking the share of total\nclicks on Indeed job postings in the US by job seekers with IP addresses\noutside of the US. Job seekers whose location could not be determined were\nremoved from the analysis.\n\nWe calculate pay transparency share in US job postings by dividing the number\nof unique job postings with a salary into a total count of unique\nadvertisements in a given month. Pay information is extracted from postings\npublished on Indeed.com. Salaries advertised as being paid daily or weekly are\nomitted from the analysis.\n\nThe analysis of the potential increases in the labor force participation rate\nassumes that labor force participation rates for workers ages 25 to 34, ages\n35 to 44, ages 45 to 54, and ages 65 plus would all return to their respective\nall-time highs. We don\u2019t assume an increase for workers ages 55 to 64 as that\ngroup is already at an all-time high. The participation rates are all\ncalculated as the annual average of the non-seasonally adjusted data.
