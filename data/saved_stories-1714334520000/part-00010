Ejiao was once a luxury consumed at the emperor\u2019s court,\nvalued as a traditional remedy taken to strengthen the blood, improve sleep,\nand slow aging. Today, ejiao is for the masses. People drink it in a tonic\nthat costs about $2 for 10 vials; eat it in small cakes made with rock sugar,\nrice wine, walnuts, and black sesame at $7 for a tin of 30; or snack on ejiao-\ncoated dates at just under a dollar a packet.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: The collagenous substance is extracted from donkey\nhides. China\u2019s domestic donkey population has plunged precipitously, and now\nthe nation\u2019s mass taste is stripping African farms of one of their most\nessential and valuable assets. In countries as far-flung as Nigeria, Ethiopia,\nand Botswana, animals that are the mainstays of many small farms\u2014where donkeys\nare used for plowing, hauling crops to market, and many other purposes\u2014are\ninstead being slaughtered for the cash value of their skins.\n\nThe drain has become so damaging to Africa\u2019s rural economy that in February\nthe 55-member African Union approved a continent-wide ban on the slaughter of\ndonkeys for their skins at its heads-of-state summit. Whether the governments\nof Africa can implement such a ban remains to be seen. If they do, they could\nseriously pinch the Chinese ejiao industry.\n\nChina\u2019s rulers have done nothing to address the issue. On the surface, their\ninaction is bewildering. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has expended huge sums of\npolitical and financial capital on wooing the countries of the developing\nworld, especially in Africa. Given that context, stepping in to regulate the\nejiao trade and help preserve the African donkey would seem an easy, low-cost\nway of proving China\u2019s willingness to be a constructive partner.\n\nRead: China\u2019s latest food scandal: fox-tainted donkey meat\n\n\u201cLeadership comes with responsibility,\u201d Oscar Meywa Otele, a political\nscientist at the University of Nairobi, told me. African countries would like\nto see China play \u201ca more meaningful and acceptable role,\u201d but the donkey\nissue is a big enough problem that it \u201cmay undermine [China\u2019s] ambitions to be\nthe leader of the global South.\u201d\n\nXi\u2019s grand goals can conflict with China\u2019s short-term economic and political\ninterests. When this occurs, it opens a window onto Beijing\u2019s true attitude\ntoward its putative partners and raises doubts about China\u2019s readiness to\nassume that leadership. That matters in Washington. As the developing world\nbecomes a battleground between the United States and China, with both eager to\ngain adherents to their competing visions for a reformed world order, the\ncontradictions of Xi\u2019s approach could damage his efforts to portray Beijing as\nmore sympathetic to the interests and needs of poor countries. The humble\ndonkey has thus taken on geopolitical significance.\n\nChina\u2019s consumption of ejiao has increased with the country\u2019s wealth. Back in\n1990, ejiao makers in China required some 200,000 donkey hides annually. Now\nthey are believed to consume about 4 to 6 million skins a year. That amounts\nto approximately 10 percent of the world\u2019s estimated donkey population of 53\nmillion\u2014a rate of attrition that is clearly unsustainable. The demand from\nejiao producers outstripped domestic supplies years ago and led to a brisk\nimport business.\n\nExactly how many hides come from Africa is unclear, but the continent is home\nto two-thirds of the world\u2019s donkeys, so it\u2019s safe to assume that African\nexports account for a large share. Because donkeys breed slowly\u2014a jennet\ntypically produces a foal only every other year\u2014the drain is rapidly depleting\nAfrica\u2019s herd. One study suggests that South Africa\u2019s donkey population\ndeclined from 210,000 animals in 1996 to 146,000 in 2019. On current trend,\nthe donkey could completely vanish from the continent over the next two\ndecades. In addition, the rising value of pelts has encouraged the illicit\nslaughter of donkeys, the bypassing of regulatory controls, and the widespread\ntheft of donkeys from poor farmers.\n\nBeijing could do much to alleviate the problem. Better regulating the donkey-\nskin trade on its end could assist African governments in monitoring and\ncontrolling exports, as well as ensure a more sustainable supply to China\u2019s\nejiao producers. Why Beijing has not bothered to react is a matter of\nspeculation. One factor could be that the government likes to promote\ntraditional medicine, at home and abroad, as a way of highlighting China\u2019s\nancient science and civilization; in that respect, it may see any restraint on\nthe industry as counter to the national interest. Or the welfare of donkeys\nand the plight of African farmers may simply be below Beijing\u2019s attention\nthreshold, compared with its more pressing geopolitical concerns.\n\nRead: A donkey ambulance for women in labor in Afghanistan\n\nChina\u2019s abusive donkey trade is part of a wider pattern of Chinese\nexploitation of the global South\u2019s resources. Chinese fleets have long been\naccused of aggressive overfishing, from the West African coast to the South\nPacific. In the South China Sea, most of which Beijing claims as its\nterritorial waters, Chinese vessels block fishermen from neighboring countries\nfrom traditional fishing grounds, which is a significant point of contention\namong governments of the region.\n\nChina\u2019s commercial interests are also at odds with Beijing\u2019s effort to promote\nitself as a champion of the world\u2019s poorest nations. A lending binge by state\nbanks, much of it to support Xi\u2019s global infrastructure-building scheme, the\nBelt and Road Initiative, has been touted as a sustainable-development program\nand proof of China\u2019s superiority as an economic partner. But these loans,\nwhich turned China into the world\u2019s largest official creditor to the\ndeveloping world, have contributed to a debt crisis in the global South as\nsome low-income countries have become overburdened and unable to make\nrepayments.\n\nYet Beijing has shown its debtors little sympathy, and the state banks have\nbeen squeezing poor countries hard. They have resisted writing down some of\nthe loan principal\u2014a common practice in debt restructurings that is aimed at\nspeeding a return to solvency\u2014and typically insist on cutting deals in secret\nto beat other creditors to what\u2019s left in the depleted coffers of debtor\ncountries. When, for instance, Angola had to restructure a $15 billion loan\nfrom China in 2020, the state-owned China Development Bank first began paying\nitself interest from a mandated escrow account. Then, anticipating the\nexhaustion of that source, the bank demanded that the cash-poor government\nreplenish it.\n\nDeveloping countries \u201care getting to know China in a different role,\u201d Bradley\nParks, the executive director of the research lab AidData at William & Mary,\ntold me. Less for its largesse, and more \u201cas the world\u2019s largest debt\ncollector.\u201d And he added: \u201cDebt collectors don\u2019t win a lot of popularity\ncontests.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, new lending from Beijing has all but dried up over the past\nfive years. As a result, the flow of funds that once went from China to the\nglobal South has reversed. A 2023 study of China\u2019s lending program published\nby the American Economic Association revealed that developing countries are\nnow paying more to Chinese banks to service their debts than they are\nreceiving in new loans.\n\nRead: The rich men who drink rhino horns\n\nChinese leaders\u2019 approach to developing-world debt \u201cis in direct tension with\ntheir desire to enjoy influence with the general public and with governing\nelites within the developing world,\u201d Parks said. Throughout this push for\ninfluence, Chinese leaders have been at pains to portray themselves as\nselfless partners, interested in the global good, in contrast with the West.\n\u201cIn promoting its own development process, China always insists on mutual\nsupport with the countries of the South, complementing each other\u2019s strengths,\nand jointly building a modernized Global South,\u201d Liu Jianchao, the influential\nhead of the Communist Party\u2019s international department, recently reiterated in\na top ideological journal.\n\nYet the reality is that China\u2019s ascent presents as many risks as benefits to\nemerging economies. Xi still appears to believe that he can lead the rising\nvoices of the global South in a struggle against their former colonial masters\nin the West. But China\u2019s actual policies toward the developing world are\nbeginning to echo that old colonialism: the exploitation of resources to\nbenefit the center, the metropole\u2019s self-perception that its superior\ncivilization confers special rights, the use of capital to extract more wealth\nfrom the less fortunate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s African governments that need to be much more proactive. You can\u2019t\nafford to let China dictate to you,\u201d Sanusha Naidu, a senior research fellow\nat the Institute for Global Dialogue, a South Africa\u2013based think tank, told\nme. \u201cThat\u2019s been the big challenge, the difficulty, in this relationship.\u201d\n\nThe African Union donkey ban is a sign that the continent\u2019s leaders are\ndeciding to act in that more proactive way. Implicit in the ban is a strong\nmessage that China can\u2019t have all it wants, on its own terms, from the global\nSouth. If the African Union succeeds in shutting down the trade in donkey\nhides to China, Beijing will no longer be able to pretend that its actions\nhave no detrimental effect on African countries or its reputation on the\ncontinent. The ejiao industry is already damaging China-Africa relations,\nLauren Johnston, a China expert at the University of Sydney, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s\nmaking people hate China.\u201d\n\nMichael Schuman is a contributing writer at The Atlantic, based in Beijing,\nChina.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
