Judaism is a beautiful, thousands-year-old tradition, and\nIsrael is a 76-year-old colonial apartheid state,\u201d Morgan Bassichis, an\norganizer with Jewish Voice for Peace, told the crowd.\n\n\u201cThis is the Passover that we take our exodus from Zionism. Not in our name.\nLet Gaza live.\u201d\n\nThe mass arrests came after the seder rituals. Speakers included journalist\nand author Naomi Klein, Palestinian activist Linda Sarsour and several Jewish\nstudents suspended from Columbia University and Barnard College over the\nprotests that have rocked US campuses in recent days.\n\nRabbi Miriam Grossman, from Brooklyn, led a prayer before the first cup of\nritual wine. \u201cWe pray for everyone besieged, for everyone facing starvation\nand mass bombardment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Passover is not like other Passovers,\u201d said Klein. \u201cSo many are not with\ntheir families but this movement is our family,\u201d she added in reference to\npolitical disagreements that have divided Jewish families since the start of\nthe war.\n\nKlein spoke after eating the bitter herbs that represent the bitterness of\nslavery at the seder. \u201cOur Judaism cannot be contained by an ethno-state, for\nour Judaism is internationalist by its very nature. Our Judaism cannot be\nprotected by the rampaging military of that ethno-state, for all that military\ndoes is sow sorrow and reap hatred, including hatred against us as Jews.\u201d\n\nJewish communities have often used Passover to protest about global injustice.\nTuesday\u2019s protest, organizers said, was inspired by the 1969 Freedom Seder,\norganized by Arthur Waskow on the anniversary of Dr Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s\ndeath. The original Freedom Seder sought to connect the Jewish exodus story\nwith the struggle for civil rights in the US and against the war in Vietnam.\n\nOne protester, a 31-year-old Jewish woman who asked not to be named for\nsecurity reasons, said: \u201cPassover is about liberation. In our family\nPalestinians have always been part of our celebration and mourning. The call\nfor liberation is more important now than ever ... as Americans the billions\nof our tax dollars in the Israeli military bill is outrageous and horrifying.\u201d\n\nJewish groups have staged a number of high profile, anti-war actions in the US\nsince 7 October, shutting down sites from the Capitol to the Statue of\nLiberty. Jewish activists held another seder on Monday, the first night of\nPassover, at Columbia\u2019s protest encampment.\n\nIsrael\u2019s offensive has killed at least 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza including\n13,000 children. The 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas killed about 1,200 people\nin southern Israel. Tuesday marked 200 days since the war began.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Protest\n  * New York\n  * Brooklyn\n  * Israel\n  * Gaza\n  * Palestinian territories\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
