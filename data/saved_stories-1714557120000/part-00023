Nick\u2019s nickname is Shorty, despite him\nbeing 6 feet 1 inch tall barefooted. Nick\u2019s nickname seems ironic given his\nheight, but it makes more sense when you learn about his family: Nick\u2019s mom is\n6\u20192\u201d\u2014she has lived in Ohio for most of her life. Nick\u2019s dad is 6\u20194\u201d\u2014he owns a\nfarm in the mountains near San Ram\u00f3n, Costa Rica. Nick\u2019s older step-brother is\n6\u20197\u201d\u2014he teaches junior (under 18) basketball in Spain and backpacks all over\nEurope when he gets bored of teaching junior basketball in Spain.\n\nIntelEdge360 with Bidemi Ologunde is a reader-supported publication.

He arrived\nCalifornia with savings from summer jobs but soon realized the high cost of\nliving. So he began working various jobs to support himself\u2014from waiting\ntables to retail store positions\u2014while attending open casting calls and\nauditions in his spare time. In February 2022, his persistence, grit, and\ndetermination paid off when he landed an unpaid internship as a creative\nassistant at a medium-sized entertainment company in Los Angeles. The\nopportunity allowed him to make connections in the industry and learn about\nthe business side of entertainment. His hard work was eventually recognized,\nand he was offered a paid position at the company in November 2022.\n\nThroughout his long and arduous journey in Southern California, Nick found a\nsupportive community of friends who share similar goals, hobbies, quirks, and\npassions\u2014individuals with legendary nicknames like El Chunky, Big Fit, Whopper\nJr., Bandido, and Noodles. They would meet every Thursday night at Live Oak\nPark in Manhattan Beach to play basketball. They would also visit a different\nlocal food joint every other Saturday night. The group also shared interests\nin voice acting, hand doubling, video game casting, stage acting, stunt\nperformance, cinematography, script supervision, film composing, set design,\nlocation management, and so on. They often collaborated on small projects\ntogether.\n\nAfter Nick\u2019s unpaid internship transitioned into a paid full-time job in late\n2022, he was able to move from his barely-comfortable shared living situation\nin Florence into a decent apartment in El Segundo, and then get a more\nreliable car, and even fly his mom out to visit him in during the summer of\n2023.\n\n> Contents Shorty & Co.
