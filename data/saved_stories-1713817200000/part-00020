Unlock developer\npotential while controlling cloud costs and risk.\n\nApr 22 2024Chris Van Wesep\n\nToday HashiCorp is excited to introduce The Infrastructure Cloud to help\norganizations and their development teams make the most of their cloud\ninvestment. Our goal is to help these teams ship code quickly while minimizing\ncloud costs and security risks.\n\nThe Infrastructure Cloud isn\u2019t a new product. Instead, it\u2019s a new way for the\nHashiCorp products to deliver value more quickly via the HashiCorp Cloud\nPlatform (HCP), a unified SaaS platform for infrastructure and security\nlifecycle management. As part of this announcement, we\u2019re bringing Terraform\nto HCP, and Terraform Cloud is now HCP Terraform.\n\nThe Infrastructure Cloud is the result of more than a decade of experience\nworking with thousands of customers to deeply understand what leads to\nsuccessful cloud adoption.\n\n## \u00bbMove fast while maintaining control of your cloud estate\n\nSuccessful cloud adoption requires successfully managing cloud applications,\ninfrastructure, and security \u2014 the cloud application value chain.\n\n### \u00bbThe 3 lifecycles of the application value chain\n\nThe application value chain describes the three systematic processes necessary\nto deliver cloud applications and maintain control over cloud infrastructure\nand security. The first, often more familiar to organizations, is Application\nLifecycle Management (ALM), which focuses on the process to code, test, and\ndeploy applications. The second is Infrastructure Lifecycle Management (ILM),\nwhich focuses on the process to build, deploy, and manage infrastructure to\nrun applications. Finally, Security Lifecycle Management (SLM) focuses on the\nprocess to protect, inspect, and connect machines, users, and applications.\nEach of these processes is an equally important part of the application value\nchain in the cloud.\n\n### \u00bbLifecycle management beyond Day 0\n\nDuring cloud migrations, many organizations invest heavily in accelerating\napplication deployment. They focus on Day 0, often neglecting critical Day 1\nto Day N activities like managing infrastructure changes, protecting\ncredentials, inspecting security logs, destroying no-longer-needed\ninfrastructure, and more. But failing to address challenges beyond Day 0 can\nlead to outages, security failures, and wasteful spending.\n\nYou can learn more about the three cycles of the concept of lifecycle\nmanagement in a new video from Armon Dadgar, HashiCorp co-founder and CTO.\n\n## \u00bbThe Infrastructure Cloud\n\nOver the past decade, HashiCorp has delivered a portfolio of infrastructure\nand security products as self-managed offerings. Many of the organizations\nwe\u2019ve worked with have emphasized the importance of delivering ILM and SLM on\na platform that provides cross-product workflows, a cloud system of record,\nand enterprise-grade capabilities. Working with our customers convinced us to\ndeliver these capabilities as part of a unified cloud platform, which is both\neasier to consume and operate. These guiding principles are the focus of our\ninvestment in the HashiCorp Cloud Platform.\n\n### \u00bbHashiCorp Cloud Platform\n\nWith the HashiCorp Cloud Platform, customers can experience the following\nbenefits:\n\n  * Faster onboarding: HCP products can be up and running in minutes because you don\u2019t need to set up an environment to run them.\n  * Cross-product workflows: With all core HashiCorp products now hosted on the same HCP platform, the products share data more easily, and more workflows can be purposefully designed to take advantage of multiple products.\n  * Latest capabilities: As new features are released to products on the HCP SaaS platform, you always have access to the latest capabilities and updates.\n  * Scale on demand: HCP can support whatever capacity organizations may require, whenever it is needed.\n  * High availability: Your ILM and SLM platform is mission-critical, so these systems must be highly available. HCP-based products include high availability by design, while running self-managed products often requires additional investment.\n  * Lower total cost of ownership (TCO): Since HashiCorp manages products in the HCP portfolio, organizations can run their infrastructure and security processes with leaner teams, reducing overall operating costs and allowing organizations to apply more resources to their core competencies.\n\n### \u00bbInfrastructure Lifecycle Management\n\nInfrastructure Lifecycle Management starts with creating new infrastructure \u2014\nsuch as a virtual machine, a Kubernetes cluster, or a Lambda function \u2014 using\ninfrastructure as code. Once this infrastructure is created, it will likely\nneed to be updated many times during its lifecycle \u2014 due to image patching,\nscaling up or down, running a new version, adding new features, fixing bugs,\netc. Changes may also result from new business requirements. Perhaps the\napplication now needs to be PCI compliant, requiring application of a new set\nof policies.\n\nBeing able to create the asset quickly, with all the right governance policies\napplied before deployment, is important, but the ongoing set of activities\nmanaging this asset to ensure continued productivity while minimizing cost and\nrisk is equally critical. Finally, the system should automatically reclaim\nthese resources when they\u2019re no longer needed.\n\nTo address infrastructure lifecycle management, HCP provides well-integrated\ninfrastructure as code workflows, a system of record for cloud resources, and\nthe capabilities to manage the lifecycle of infrastructure.\n\nThe HashiCorp products that underpin Infrastructure Lifecycle Management are:\n\n  * Terraform: As noted above, HashiCorp Terraform Cloud is now HCP Terraform. This is a major step toward our goal of offering a unified HCP experience using a single workflow to let organizations rely on infrastructure as code to provision their cloud, networking, private datacenter, and SaaS infrastructure and continuously manage infrastructure throughout its lifecycle.\n  * Packer: Organizations can use a single workflow to build cloud and private datacenter images and continuously manage the lifecycle of images in provisioning pipelines.\n  * Waypoint: Users can create an internal developer platform (IDP) to enable platform teams to deliver golden patterns and workflows to manage applications at scale in any environment. HCP Waypoint is currently in beta, and scheduled to be generally available in 2024.\n  * Nomad: Bring modern, multi-tenant compute orchestration and application scheduling to any type of software. Self-managed only, Nomad manages containers, binaries, and virtual machines efficiently in the cloud, on-premises, and across edge environments.\n\n### \u00bbSecurity Lifecycle Management\n\nSecurity Lifecycle Management involves protecting secrets, certificates, and\nother credentials, inspecting your digital estate for unsecured credentials,\nand connecting authorized machines, services, and people. The process starts\nwith the creation of a secret, perhaps for something as simple as enabling an\napplication to talk to a database. This secret will need to be rotated\nregularly, and many organizations still spend thousands of hours manually\nrotating secrets, or simply don't rotate them often enough \u2014 or at all. And,\nof course, this rotated secret might require a refresh of the associated\ninfrastructure to pick up that new secret, emphasizing the interconnected\nnature of ILM and SLM. Ultimately, when the associated application is no\nlonger needed and is decommissioned, the secret should also be destroyed to\nlimit the potential attack surface.\n\nTo address Security Lifecycle Management, HCP provides well-integrated\nidentity-based security workflows, a system of record for sensitive\ninformation (credentials, certificates, keys, customer data), and the\ncapabilities to manage the lifecycle of security.\n\nThe HashiCorp products that underpin Security Lifecycle Management are:\n\n  * Vault: A secrets management solution for storing, distributing, and rotating secrets; as well as brokering access between people, machines, and services.\n  * Boundary: A modern approach to remote user access and privileged access management (PAM) using identity-driven controls to secure user access across dynamic environments.\n  * Consul: An identity-based approach to service networking for service discovery, secure communication, and network automation across multiple cloud and runtime environments.\n\n## \u00bbThe way to do cloud right\n\nCloud can be hard to get right. With effective Infrastructure Lifecycle\nManagement and Security Lifecycle Management on The Infrastructure Cloud,\nHashiCorp provides the right foundation and scalable cloud principles to help\nget you there \u2014 and our products are already in production at hundreds of the\nworld\u2019s largest organizations. The Infrastructure Cloud is here to help you do\ncloud right.\n\nTo learn more about The Infrastructure Cloud:\n\n  * Read The Infrastructure Cloud white paper\n  * Visit The Infrastructure Cloud home page\n\n    * Visit the Infrastructure Lifecycle Management page\n    * Visit the Security Lifecycle Management page\n  * Check out The Infrastructure Cloud press release\n  * Watch the How does The Infrastructure Cloud work? video\n\nHCPHashiCorp\n\n#### Sign up for the latest HashiCorp news\n\n#### More blog posts like this one\n\nApril 18 2024 | Products & Technology\n\n##### How secret scanning works\n\nHCP Vault Radar conducts ongoing reconnaissance of unsecured secrets stored as\nplain text in code repositories as well as configuration, DevOps, and\ncollaboration tools.\n\nApril 16 2024 | Products & Technology\n\n##### HCP Packer webhooks now generally available\n\nWebhooks for HCP Packer automatically notify external systems about image-\nrelated events.\n\nApril 11 2024 | Products & Technology\n\n##### Secrets sync now available on Vault Enterprise to manage secrets sprawl\n\nSecrets sync is a new feature in HashiCorp Vault that facilitates centralized\nmanagement, governance, and control of secrets for multiple external secret\nmanagers.\n\nSign up for the HashiCorp newsletter\n\nProducts\n\n  * Terraform\n  * Packer\n  * Vault\n  * Consul\n  * Nomad\n  * Waypoint\n  * Vagrant\n  * Boundary\n\nResources\n\n  * Whitepapers\n  * Events\n  * Webinars\n  * Support\n  * Community\n  * Podcast\n  * Training\n  * Professional Services\n\nDevelopers\n\n  * Docs\n  * Tutorials\n  * Integrations\n  * Resource Library\n  * Community\n\nCompany\n\n  * About\n  * Press\n  * Careers\n  * Blog\n  * Investors\n  * Brand\n  * Contact Us\n  * Become a Partner\n\nInternational sites\n\n  * French\n  * German\n  * Japanese\n  * Korean\n  * Portuguese\n  * Spanish\n\n  * System Status\n  * Terms of use\n  * Trust center\n  * Trademark policy\n  * Trade controls\n\n  * GitHub\n  * X\n  * Youtube\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Facebook\n  * Meetup\n\nWe use cookies & other similar technology to collect data to improve your\nexperience on our site, as described in our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
