Anders Ericsson\n\nPublishedJune 27, 2016\n\nWe may earn a commission from links on this page.\n\nIn the early 1940s, the best middle-distance runner in the world was a man\nnamed Gunder H\u00e4gg. H\u00e4gg had grown up with his father, a lumberjack, in an\nisolated part of northern Sweden. As a teenager, he loved running in the\nwoods. Eventually, he and his father became curious about how fast he could\nrun. They mapped out a course that was about 1,500 meters long, and Gunder ran\nthe circuit while his father timed him with an alarm clock.\n\nAfterward, H\u00e4gg\u2019s father told him that he had completed the course in four\nminutes and 50 seconds\u2014a remarkably good time for that distance in the woods.\nAs he would later recall in his autobiography, H\u00e4gg was inspired by his\nperformance to believe that he had a bright future as a runner. So he started\ntraining more seriously. He went on to become one of the world\u2019s premier\nrunners, breaking a total of 15 world records during his career.\n\nLike many of the people who become top performers in their fields, H\u00e4gg and\nhis father believed that he had the ability to become very good at a\nparticular skill. It was this belief that convinced him it would be worthwhile\nto put in the long hours necessary to become a world-class runner. But as we\nexplain in our book Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise, innate\ntalent has little to do with a person\u2019s ultimate success. What matters is\nwhether we are willing and able to devote ourselves to deliberate practice.\n\nWhat is surprising is just how little basis there is for any of these beliefs\nof predestined greatness.\n\nIn one classic study, psychologist Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues studied a\ngroup of top performers in six different fields: swimming, tennis, piano,\nsculpting, mathematics, and neuroscience. One thing that stood out about these\nvery accomplished people was that as children, they all had at least one very\nsupportive adult in their lives. This person told them that they were special,\nand had unique potential.\n\nThis is a common theme in the development of so many of the world\u2019s champion\nathletes, world-class musicians, prize-winning scientists and artists, and\nothers at the top of their fields. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone putting\nin the effort necessary to become among the best in the world in some area\nwithout believing that all that hard work was going to pay off. What is\nsurprising is just how little basis there is for any of these beliefs of\npredestined greatness.\n\nWhen Bloom looked more closely at the childhoods of top performers, he found\nno evidence that these individuals had been measurably superior to their peers\nbefore they began their rigorous training. Yes, their parents believed in\nthem\u2014but that\u2019s what parents do. For every child with highly supportive\nparents who winds up becoming a chess grandmaster or Nobel Prize-winning\nphysicist, there are many more who turn out to be ordinary.\n\nConvince a child that he or she has a special talent, and you increase the\nodds tremendously that the child will actually grow up to be something\nspecial.\n\nThe truth is that there is very little connection between a person\u2019s early\nsuccess\u2014the sort that leads parents and others to declare that someone has\n\u201cnatural talent\u201d\u2014and their ultimate success. Children who are better than\ntheir peers in the early stages of learning a skill\u2014playing the piano, hitting\na baseball, reading, drawing, or working with numbers\u2014are not guaranteed to\nsucceed as an adult.\n\nWhat of Gunder H\u00e4gg? Surely his destiny was clear when he ran that exceptional\ntime on the course through the forest? As it turns out, H\u00e4gg was not so\nexceptional on that day. Many years later, his father confessed that he had\nlied. H\u00e4gg\u2019s actual time was five minutes, 50 seconds\u2014a full minute slower\nthan his father had reported, and a time that was by no means special. His\nfather explained that he had exaggerated H\u00e4gg\u2019s speed because he was worried\nthat his son had lost his passion for running and needed encouragement. It\nobviously worked.\n\nThe phenomenon we see at work with H\u00e4gg and the other superior performers that\nBloom studied is very similar to the placebo effect in medicine. Give someone\na sugar pill but pretend it\u2019s a real drug, and that person is more likely to\nreport feeling better than someone who gets nothing. Similarly, convince a\nyoung child that he or she has a special talent, and you increase the odds\ntremendously that the child will actually grow up to be something special.\n\nThere is a big difference, however. The placebo effect requires nothing more\nthan a belief in the efficacy of the sugar pill. But getting someone to\nbelieve in their own talent requires years of hard work and practice.\n\nHere\u2019s how it generally works: Parents who believe a child is gifted will work\nto find a suitable teacher to guide the child\u2019s training. The parents\nthemselves also encourage and oversee the child\u2019s practice. The child, feeling\nspecial because of the attention, wants to please the parents and the teacher\nand works hard to improve. Over time, the practice pays off, and the child\ndevelops a skill that is itself rewarding because of the positive feedback he\nor she gets from peers and adults. The child develops a self-image as a\nviolinist or a swimmer or a gymnast or an artist, and the initial observation\nthat the child had a \u201cnatural talent\u201d in that area seems to have been borne\nout.\n\nDeliberate practice depends on extensive feedback, and is the most effective\nform of training that researchers have yet to discover.\n\nIn fact, it is the years of training that make some people proficient in a\ngiven skill\u2014not some sort of innate talent. Typically, that training comes in\nthe form of deliberate practice, a type of practice that is teacher-directed\nand focused on incremental advances that add up to major improvement.\nDeliberate practice depends on extensive feedback, and is the most effective\nform of training that researchers have yet to discover. But it is hard\nwork\u2014and thus not likely to be pursued for long by someone who isn\u2019t convinced\nthe effort is worth it.\n\nThis is why a parent\u2019s initial belief in a child\u2019s extraordinary gifts is so\nimportant. This belief makes it much more likely that both the child and the\nparents will make the necessary investment in training for the child to become\nspecial.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that a relatively small percentage of parents are\nwilling to commit to this level of development. In fact, most children could\nbenefit from this sort of training.\n\nWe would like to see many more children taking advantage of deliberate\npractice to get started on the right path to building a talent\u2014thus opening up\na world that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. Deliberate practice is\nsuch a powerful tool for developing one\u2019s potential that it seems a shame that\nso few people today actually use it.\n\nBut how can we make this happen? The answer is not to convince more parents\nthat their children have some special talent that needs to be developed.\nInstead, we need to spread the word that with the right sort of practice,\npretty much anyone can develop incredible abilities.\n\nWe need to spread the word that with the right sort of practice, pretty much\nanyone can develop incredible abilities.\n\nWe also need to communicate this message on a personal level\u2014to convince\nindividuals that dramatic improvement is possible and to show them how it is\ndone. One of the best ways to do this is to identify particular teachers or\ncoaches who have a special knack for helping others. Most of these mentors\nknow there is nothing magical about helping young people to accomplish big\nthings\u2014the same training techniques can help anyone get better. A good teacher\nwill assess a student\u2019s skill level, identify training goals, and develop a\nregimen to meet those goals.\n\nOf course, we need to have a good reason if we\u2019re going to devote ourselves to\nsuch a rigorous undertaking. In place of the conviction that you or your child\nhave some special talent, it is better to choose to pursue a given skill for\nthe sake of the skill itself. Playing music for yourself or your friends,\ndrawing pictures of the places you visit or taking photos the people you meet,\ncompeting with others at tennis or softball, generating ideas and thinking\nabout important topics\u2014these are tangible fruits of deliberate practice that\nanyone can appreciate. You don\u2019t need to become the best in order for a skill\nto prove rewarding.\n\nThere will always be some people who want to reach the top of their fields.\nBut for most of us, it is enough to have a motivation that is less ambitious\nand more personal. We want to be able to take control of our own potential and\nshape ourselves into the people we wish to be. Deliberate practice makes that\npossible.\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
