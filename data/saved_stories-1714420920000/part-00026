He's never been more wrong.\n\nElena Lacey; Getty Images\n\nJoseph Tartaro never meant to cause this much trouble. Especially for himself.\n\nIn late 2016, Tartaro decided to get a vanity license plate. A security\nresearcher by trade, he ticked down possibilities that related to his work:\nSEGFAULT, maybe, or something to do with vulnerabilities. Sifting through his\noptions, he started typing \u201cnull pointer,\u201d but caught himself after the first\nword: NULL. Funny. \u201cThe idea was I\u2019d get VOID for my wife\u2019s car, so our\ndriveway would be NULL and VOID,\u201d Tartaro says.\n\nThe joke had layers, though. As Tartaro well knew, and as he explained in a\nrecent talk at the Defcon hacker conference, \u201cnull\u201d is also a text string that\nin many programming languages signifies a value that is empty or undefined. To\nmany computers, null is the void.\n\nThat setup also has a brutal punch line\u2014one that left Tartaro at one point\nfacing $12,049 of traffic fines wrongly sent his way. He\u2019s still not sure if\nhe\u2019ll be able to renew his auto registration this year without paying someone\nelse's tickets. And thanks to the Kafkaesque loop he\u2019s caught in, it\u2019s not\nclear if the citations will ever stop coming.\n\nNull Set\n\nIn his Defcon talk, Tartaro played up the idea that he had initially hoped a\nNULL plate might get him out of tickets\u2014that, once fed into the database of\noffenders, the violation quite literally would not compute. But he says now\nthat pranks weren\u2019t actually his initial focus. If anything, he was surprised\nthat the California DMV website let him register NULL in the first place.\n\nTrending Now\n\nThat first year as a NULL driver was uneventful. But when it came time to\nrenew in 2017, the DMV website no longer accepted NULL as an option. \u201cIt broke\nthe website,\u201d Tartaro says. Specifically, the site told him that the license\nplate and vehicle identification number he had entered, known as the VIN, were\ninvalid. But Tartaro was still able to use a reference number to renew. He\ndidn\u2019t think much more of it.\n\nHe also didn\u2019t think much of the ticket he got in early 2018, for not having\nthe appropriate registration sticker on his license plate. Tartaro suspects\nsomeone scraped it off to use on their own car. He thought about fighting it,\nbut the fine was only $35, so he decided to just pay it and move on with his\nlife.\n\nThen came the citations. Dozens of them, deposited in bulk to his mailbox.\nParking violations, stand-stop violations, fines of $37, $60, $74, $80, from\nFresno to Rancho Cucamonga. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Fresno,\u201d Tartaro says of the\nCalifornia city.\n\nNor had Tartaro gone on a statewide, parking-related crime spree. Instead, by\npaying that $35 ticket, it appears that a database somewhere now associated\nNULL with his personal information. Which means that any time a traffic cop\nforgot to fill in the license plate number on a citation, the fine\nautomatically got sent to Joseph Tartaro.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Mysterious \u2018Dark\u2019 Energy That Permeates the Universe Is Slowly Eroding\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Gear\n\nI Tried These AI-Based Productivity Tools.

(Tartaro has an\nInfiniti.) At one point, Tartaro says, he received two tickets written at\nCypress College within hours of each other\u2014for two different vehicles. He\nwould have had to swap the registration during his lunch break. Worse yet, the\nincoming citations seemed to apply retroactively.\n\n\u201cI have tickets from 2014,\u201d Tartaro adds. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the plate back then.\u201d\n\nCitations 'R' Us\n\nThe fines were all sent by a private company called the Citation Processing\nCenter, which, well, processes parking citations. But calling them, Tartaro\nsays, proved fruitless. \u201cI reached out to this company, and they\u2019re basically\nsaying that I have to prove without a doubt that these hundreds of tickets\naren\u2019t mine. Trying to speak to a manager went nowhere. He\u2019s like, you\u2019ve got\nto mail all these back to us.\u201d\n\nTartaro declined, worried about potentially losing the paper record of the\nmisallocated fines. But the next day, he says, he noticed something odd in the\npublic online listing of citations maintained at the Citation Processing\nCenter\u2019s website. He had given them an example of a specific ticket he had\ngotten that implicated a Honda. Online, that record had been changed to an\nInfiniti with Taranto\u2019s VIN. Taranto shared a side by side comparison of his\npaper copy and the apparently altered database version as part of his Defcon\ntalk.\n\n\u201cAfter I had the phone call, directly after the phone call, those same tickets\nwhere I still have the physical printouts in front of me right now that say\ntheir make and model were modified,\u201d Tartaro says. A Citation Processing\nCenter employee said that while she was aware of Tartaro\u2019s situation, the\ncompany was unable to comment.\n\nTartaro next turned to the DMV, which he says worked with the Citation\nProcessing Center to void out the bulk of tickets that had errantly come his\nway. That successfully got the amount owed down to $6,262 as of last weekend,\nbut didn\u2019t solve the core problem. More tickets continued to trickle in. The\ndatabase still had him pegged.\n\nEven through all this, Tartaro remained mostly unconcerned. The CPC was just a\nprivate company; he could keep working with the DMV to void the fines as they\ncame in, which was an annoyance but not a catastrophe. He had successfully\nregistered his car the previous year despite CPC citations piling up. But just\ndays before Defcon, according to Tartaro, he says he received a notice that\nthe California DMV would not let him renew his registration unless he actually\npaid some of those fines.\n\n\u201cNow that the DMV is enforcing these tickets that are falsified, it changes\neverything,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the moment, I cannot reregister my vehicle without\npaying the tickets. But I can\u2019t pay the tickets because it admits guilt, and\nthe minute I admit that it opens me up to all the other tickets. I\u2019m basically\nin a really bad situation.\u201d\n\nThe situation has improved somewhat in recent days, at least. Tartaro\ncalculates that tickets assigned to his car still tallied over $6,000 when he\nlast checked on Sunday. When WIRED looked up the NULL plate in the CPC\ndatabase Tuesday, after asking the company about the charges, it showed only\n$140 worth of tickets remaining\u2014both from Fresno.\n\nInfiniti and Beyond\n\nTartaro doesn\u2019t see this as much of a reprieve. He\u2019s glad the tickets have\nvanished, but he would still need to pay $140 to reregister his car. And\nthere\u2019s no guarantee that more fines won\u2019t show up along the way.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to know where to turn for resolution. \u201cMr. Tartaro\u2019s situation\nappears to stem from policies set by local parking authorities\u2014which the DMV\nhas no control over,\u201d California DMV spokesperson Marty Geenstein said. \u201cFrom\nthe DMV\u2019s perspective, our system recognizes his personalized plate and shows\nhe is eligible to renew his registration online.\u201d Assuming he pays the fee.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Mysterious \u2018Dark\u2019 Energy That Permeates the Universe Is Slowly Eroding\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Gear\n\nI Tried These AI-Based Productivity Tools.

Null has himself had to deal with\ncountless annoyances, from American Express dropping his last name altogether,\nto Bank of America refusing to accept emails from his \"nullmedia.com\" domain.\n\nStill, Tartaro says he\u2019s determined to keep his problematic license plate, and\nnot just as a point of pride. \u201cI still have tickets associated with me. The\nmoment I change my plate I just know it\u2019s going to be even more convoluted,\nand more confusing,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable changing it until I\nknew it was actually solved.\u201d\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n  * How smaller cities are trying to plug brain drain\n  * The radical transformation of the textbook\n  * How scientists built a \u201cliving drug\u201d to beat cancer\n  * An iPhone app that protects your privacy\u2014for real\n  * How white nationalists have co-opted fan fiction\n  * \ud83d\udcf1 Torn between the latest phones?
