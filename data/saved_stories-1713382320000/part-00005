The present work focuses on the microwave-assisted hydrogenolysis\nof oxytetracycline to selectively produce \u03b1-doxycycline. Although the\ncombination of microwave irradiation and a heterogeneous rhodium catalyst\nprovided good conversions, the selective synthesis of active \u03b1-doxycycline was\nonly achieved when an oxytetracycline-cyclodextrin complex was used as the\nstarting material, giving the desired product at 34.0% yield in a one-step\nreaction under very mild conditions.\n\nKeywords: doxycycline, microwave-assisted reaction, cyclodextrins\ncomplexation, rhodium catalyst, stereoselective synthesis\n\nGo to:\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nTetracyclines are one of the most widely used classes of antibiotics [1] for\nhuman and veterinary use [2]. First isolated from Streptomyces aureofaciens in\nthe 1940s, they derive their name from tetracycline, which is the simplest of\nthese molecules that still retain antibiotic functions, although it was not\nthe first to be isolated [3]. First-generation tetracyclines, such as\nchlortetracycline and oxytetracycline, naturally occur in soil bacteria\ncolonies [4,5,6]. Second-generation tetracyclines are synthetic or semi-\nsynthetic drugs that are often produced via the modification of natural\ntetracyclines. They show improved activity, stability and reduce the\ninsurgence of bacterial resistance [7,8,9]. In particular, doxycycline,\n4-dimethylamino-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,5,10,12,12a-pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-2,naphthacencarboxamide,\nis one of the most commonly used semi-synthetic derivatives of tetracycline\n[10]. Doxycycline is an isomer of tetracycline that differs only in the\nposition of one hydroxyl group. Doxycycline can be formally viewed as the\nresult of the transfer of the C_6 hydroxyl group of tetracycline to C_5. It is\nbacteriostatic and acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis via the\ndisruption of transfer and messenger RNA at ribosomal sites [11]. Its\nsynthesis was first reported by Pfizer [12], and it is nowadays industrially\nproduced starting from oxytetracycline, having methacycline as an\nintermediate. Another early route for this synthesis was reported and patented\nby Jensen and McCormick in 1962 [13] and involved the hydrogenolysis of\noxytetracycline over an Rh/C 5 wt% catalyst under H_2 pressure. While this\ndirect conversion over a heterogeneous catalyst was appealing, it made use of\ndimethylformamide (DMF) and water 1:1 mixture and involved 16 h of reaction at\nroom temperature. Nevertheless, few improvements have been made to this\nprocess since then; this is mainly because of the high cost of rhodium and the\nlow doxycycline yields, with 6-epi-doxycycline being a common secondary\nproduct [14]. Indeed, C6 hydrogenolysis involves a stereocenter and can result\nin two epimers: the \u03b1 (common doxycycline, pharmaceutically active) and the \u03b2\n(6-epi-doxycycline) forms. \u03b2 epimer formation may be favored when a\nheterogeneous catalyst is used because of the substrate\u2019s skeletal\nconfiguration, which leads to it approaching the catalyst from the side of the\nmethyl substituent [15]. More recent work involved the hydrogenation of\nmethacycline over a Pd/C 0.4 wt% catalyst that was poisoned with a\nthiourea/quinoline mixture [16]. The mixture coordinates the Pd active sites,\ncreating a steric hindrance that pushes the reaction towards the desired\nproduct. This approach led to 94.5% enantioselectivity towards \u03b1-doxycycline\nand conversion of 90.7%. The introduction of chirality in drugs during their\nsynthesis is of crucial importance. Over the past few years, the new\nopportunities offered by homogeneous transition metal catalysis have been\nrealized [17].\n\nMany authors have opted for the use of homogeneous Rh(I) and Rh(III) catalysts\ninstead, controlling the enantioselectivity of the reaction via the steric\nhindrance of the organic ligands [13,18]. The total synthesis of doxycycline,\nstarting from simple building blocks, is also possible, but generally involves\nseveral steps that lower the yield. One example is the enantioselective\nsynthesis reported by Charest et al., which indeed led to the \u03b1 form of\ndoxycycline, but in 18 steps with a yield of 8.3% [19].\n\nThe present work focuses on the hydrogenolysis of oxytetracycline via the\nscreening of different supported Rh catalysts. The objective was not only the\nsynthesis of \u03b1-doxycycline but also the improvement of the conditions found in\nthe literature to create a greener protocol. For this reason, we also compared\nconventional and microwave (MW) heating. MW was used to reduce both the\nreaction time and the amount of catalyst needed, exploiting their fast and\nintense activation of metallic nanoparticles [20,21]. MW is known for its\nfast-heating rate and the creation of hotspots and inverse thermal gradients\n[22,23,24]. The use of a heterogeneous catalyst creates synergistic effects\nwith MW and allows the solid to be easily recovered and reused [25].\nFurthermore, once we established which heating technique works best,\ncyclodextrins (CDs) were used as complexing agents for the starting\noxytetracycline to test whether it is possible to influence the\nenantioselectivity of the reaction. CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides that are\nmade up of glucopyranose units connected by \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bonds. They are\nnon-toxic and widely used even in food applications [26]. CDs are the one of\nmost used chiral selectors in capillary electrophoresis and their exclusive\nstructures, involving a truncated cone shape cavity with a hydrophilic\nexternal surface and a hydrophobic internal surface, making them effective for\nseparation purposes [27,28,29]. Indeed, CDs can form host\u2013guest complexes with\norganic molecules. Host\u2013guest complexes are molecular aggregates that are\nstabilized via non-covalent bonds (for example, van der Waals, hydrogen bonds,\nand hydrophobic interactions) that can be easily broken under mild conditions\n(using an organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol). Tetracycline\nsupramolecular complexes with CDs have previously been investigated [30] for\nuse in analytical and biological applications, but, to the best of our\nknowledge, no synthetic investigations on similar supramolecular complexes\n(involving tetracyclines and CDs) have been performed so far. In the present\nwork, the inclusion process of oxytetracycline with CDs has been investigated,\nfor the first time, for the selective MW-assisted synthesis of \u03b1-doxycycline\nunder heterogeneous catalysis.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\nAll organic reagents, catalysts, and solvents were purchased from Sigma\nAldrich (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) and used without further\npurification. The CDs were purchased from Wacker Chemie, Munich, Germany. MW-\nassisted reactions were carried out in a SynthWAVE reactor (MLS GmbH,\nLeutkirch im Allg\u00e4u, Germany; Milestone Srl, Bergamo, Italy), which housed a\nclosed MW-cavity. Conventional reactions were performed in a 300 mL PolyBlock\nstainless steel reactor.\n\nHPLC-DAD analysis was performed using an HPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford,\nMA, USA) coupled with a diode array detector (UV/DAD, Waters Corp., Milford,\nMA, USA) and an automatic sampler (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). A Gemini\nNXC18 column (250 mm, 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used\nwith gradient elution and UV-DAD acquisitions at 270 and 360 nm.\n\nA Fraction Link separation module, equipped with Waters Micromass ZQ Mass\nSpectrometer was used to identify the final product (see Supplementary\nMaterials).\n\nNMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECZR 600 spectrometer, operating at 14T,\nat 25 \u00b0C in an appropriate deuterated solvent; chemical shifts were referenced\nusing the residual solvent proton or carbon resonances. Full assignment was\nobtained using COSY, ^1H-^13C HMQC, ^1H-^13C HMBC 2D-spectroscopies (see\nSupplementary Materials).\n\n### 2.1. General Procedure for the Conventional and MW-Assisted Synthesis of\nDoxycycline\n\nThe 300 mL PolyBlock stainless steel reactor used for the conventional heating\ntests was equipped with temperature and pressure control and a PTFE stirrer.\nThe reactor could operate up to 100 bar and 250 \u00b0C. A sampling valve on the\nbottom of the reactor was directly connected to the cooling chamber.\n\nMW-assisted reactions were carried out in a SynthWAVE reactor, which is a\nmultimode MW system, equipped with multiple gas inlets, able to operate up to\n300 \u00b0C and 199 bars, both on small and large scales (from 2 to 600 mL).\nIntegrated sensors continuously monitor the internal pressure and temperature\nallowing the software to adjust, in real-time, the applied MW power to follow\na predefined temperature profile.\n\nIn a typical experiment both with MW and with conventional heating,\noxytetracycline (0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of solvent (DMF/H_2O 1:1,\nMeOH, or H_2O) in the presence of 50 mg of supported Rh catalysts (5 wt.%).\nThe reactions were performed under magnetic stirring (400 rpm) at a fixed\ntemperature and for a predefined time (see Table 1) under H_2 pressure of 5 or\n10 bar.\n\n### Table 1\n\nDoxycycline synthesis under conventional and MW-assisted conditions.\n\nEntry| Heating| Solvent| Catalyst| H_2 (bar)| T (\u00b0C)| Time (h)| Yield \u03b2-Doxy\n(%)| Yield \u03b1-Doxy (%)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1a| Conventional ^a| DMF/H_2O| Rh/AC 5%| 5| 50| 16| traces| n.d.  \nDMF/H_2O| Rh/AC 5%| 5| 70| 16| traces| n.d.  \n2a| H_2O| Rh/AC 5%| 10| 50| 16| traces| n.d.  \n3a| MeOH| Rh/AC 5%| 10| 50| 16| 3.00| n.d.  \n4a| H_2O| Rh/Al_2O_3 5%| 10| 50| 16| 0.50| n.d.  \n5a| MeOH| Rh/Al_2O_3 5%| 10| 50| 16| traces| n.d.  \n6a| MW ^b| DMF/H_2O| Rh/AC 5%| 5| 50| 4| 1.20| n.d.  \n7a| DMF/H_2O| Rh/AC 5%| 5| 50| 2| 2.15| n.d.  \n8a| DMF/H_2O| Rh/AC 5%| 5| 70| 2| 0.95| n.d.  \n9a| H_2O| Rh/AC 5%| 5| 50| 2| traces| n.d.  \n10a| MeOH| Rh/AC 5%| 5| 50| 2| 36.90| n.d.  \n11a| H_2O| Rh/Al_2O_3 5%| 5| 50| 2| 34.20| n.d.  \n12a| MeOH| Rh/Al_2O_3 5%| 5| 50| 2| 1.10| n.d.  \n  \nOpen in a separate window\n\n^a conventional heating, 50 mg oxytetracycline, 5 mg Rh/AC 5 wt%. ^b MW\nheating, 50 mg oxytetracycline, 50 mg Rh/AC 5 wt%. n.d. = non detected.\n\n### 2.2. General Procedure for Oxytetracycline-CD Complexation and Further\nHydrogenolysis Reaction\n\nCDs were used as chiral selectors. Three different CDs were considered: \u03b2CD,\nrandomly methylated \u03b2CD (RAMEB), and \u03b3CD. Water was used as a solvent to favor\nCD dissolution and avoid any possible competition in the complexation\nreaction. HCl 0.01 M was used to allow oxytetracycline dissolution.\n\nComplexation was performed with a 1:1 molar ratio of CDs (5.50 g) to\noxytetracycline (1.92 g) in water. CDs were not dried before use and a 14 wt%\n(\u03b2CD) and 10 wt% (\u03b3CD) of water were considered. HCl 0.001 M was added to\nsolubilize the cycline. The solution was then stirred for 12 h and filtered.\nBoth RAMEB and \u03b3CD resulted in a homogeneous solution that was collected and\nfreeze-dried to obtain a yellow crystalline solid. The \u03b2CD resulted in a\nprecipitate that was collected after filtration and dried in a vacuum (3.10\ng). The solution was freeze-dried, obtaining 4.32 g solid. UV-Vis analysis of\nthe two solid fractions indicates a content of 30% w/w of oxytetracycline for\nthe first solid and 25% w/w for the second one (Figure 1). The UV-Vis spectra\nwere visualized via SpectraGryph 1.2 software.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 1\n\nOxytetracycline/\u03b2-CD complex UV-Vis analyses.\n\nThe so-formed complexes (150 mg) were hydrogenated in water (2 mL) under 5 bar\nof H_2 using an Rh/AC or Rh/Al_2O_3 5 wt % commercial catalyst in a 1:1 weight\nratio to the oxytetracycline: the catalyst amount is notably high but still\nhalved compared to the starting work reported in the literature [13]. The\nreactions were performed under MW irradiation at 50 \u00b0C for 2 and 4 h. The\nmixture was then filtered and washed with EtOH/water (1:1) to recover the\nproducts from the precipitated complexes.\n\n### 2.3. \u03b2-Doxycycline Chacterization\n\n1H-NMR (D_2O, 600MHz, \u03b4 ppm): 7.56, 1H (H-8); 6.96, 1H (H-7); 6.92, 1H (H-9);\n3.74, 1H (H-5), 3.40, 1H (H-4); 3.35, 1H (H-6); 3.14, 1H (H-5a); 2.93, 6H\n(N-CH_3); 2.77, 1H (H-4a); 1.03, 3H (CH_3).\n\n13C-NMR from HMQC and HMBC (D_2O, 150MHz, \u03b4 ppm): 135.0 (C-8), 119.5 (C-7),\n116.2 (C-9), 67.1 (C-5), 66.3 (C-4), 44.8 (N-CH3), 44.3 (C-5a), 42.0 (C-4a),\n33.0 (C-6), 16.1 (CH3).\n\nHPLC-MS, Rt 11.44, m/z = 445.\n\n### 2.4. \u03b1-Doxycycline Chacterization\n\n1H-NMR (D_2O, 600MHz, \u03b4 ppm): 7.32, 1H (H-8); 6.77, 1H (H-7); 6.55, 1H (H-9);\n4.2, 1H (H-4); 3.56, 1H (H-5), 2.40, 1H (H-6); 2.30, 1H (H-5a); 2.80, 6H\n(N-CH_3); 2.63, 1H (H-4a); 1.30, 3H (CH_3).\n\n13C-NMR from HMQC and HMBC (D_2O, 150MHz, \u03b4 ppm): 160.0 (C-10), 147 (C-6a)\n137.1 (C-8), 116.3 (C-7), 115.9 (C-9), 73.1 (C-12a), 68.4 (C-5), 65.6 (C-4),\n44.5 (N-CH_3), 45.7 (C-5a), 41.3 (C-4a), 37.0 (C-6), 14.9 (CH_3).\n\nHPLC-MS, Rt 11.56, m/z = 445.\n\n### 2.5.

Results and Discussion\n\n### 3.1. A-Doxycycline Synthesis under Heterogeneous Rhodium Catalyst\n\nOxytetracycline hydrogenolysis was initially performed without the addition of\nCDs as chiral selectors over heterogeneous Rh catalysts (Scheme 1). The\nreactions were performed over commercial Rh/AC and Rh/Al_2O_3 5 wt%: these two\ncommercially available options were chosen to test any role of the support\nover the final result. DMF/water 1:1 mixture was reported in the literature\nfor the reaction; we also tested methanol (MeOH) and pure water to replace the\nDMF, aiming for a more sustainable process. The addition of HCl to 0.01 M was\nused to solubilize the reagent. The list of the experimental conditions tested\nis presented in Table 1.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nScheme 1\n\nMW-assisted doxycycline synthesis under rhodium heterogeneous catalysis.\n\nConventional and MW heating were compared because, to the best of our\nknowledge, MW has never been employed for this synthesis. The results show\nthat it is possible to drastically reduce the reaction time using MW; however,\nin these conditions only \u03b2-doxycycline was obtained. With conventional\nheating, 16 h were necessary, and \u03b2-doxycycline was obtained only in low\namounts. Water and methanol are preferred as solvents for the reaction, both\nin MW-assisted and in conventional experiments, although \u03b2-doxycycline was\nstill obtained with DMF/H_2O under MW. The results were evaluated considering\nthe ratio of doxycycline over oxytetracycline after HPLC-DAD analysis (Graphic\n1). \u03b2-doxycycline was identified by NMR spectroscopy, also by comparing data\nwith those obtained on a standard of \u03b1-doxycycline (see Supplementary\nMaterials: Figures S1\u2013S12).\n\nThis improvement in activity under MW is likely due to the interaction of the\nsolid catalyst with the radiation, the faster and homogeneous heating, and\npossibly the resulting hotspots. The reaction was also tested at 70 \u00b0C for 4 h\nseparately in DMF/H_2O, as a reference from the literature, however, the\nharsher conditions resulted in a drop in selectivity. Also, a 10:1 substrate\nto catalyst weight ratio was tested for the optimized conditions over the two\nsupports, but this led to the product only in traces.\n\nFurthermore, the addition of \u03b1-doxycycline as an internal standard proved that\nonly the \u03b2-form is obtained in these conditions, and so we introduced CDs. As\nCDs can complex MeOH, it is not recommended to use it as a solvent; otherwise,\nthe complexes with oxytetracycline may be destroyed. Surprisingly, the\naddition of CDs improved the conversion over Rh/AC when 4 h were used, while\nyield and selectivity were not affected using Rh/Al_2O_3.\n\nThe subsequent experiments were all performed in water, using MW and Rh/AC.\nThe first CD test involved the \u03b2CD residue in a 2-h reaction. This resulted in\n\u03b1-doxycycline, although in a negligible amount, as confirmed by HPLC-DAD and\nHPLC-MS analysis with the addition of the internal standard (Figures S13\u2013S15).\nHowever, oxytetracycline conversion was not complete. New 4-h hydrogenation\nwas performed, and the \u03b1-doxycycline yield improved from 4.0 to 14.1%. This\nmay be explained by the higher stability, and consequent lower reactivity of\nthe complexes, compared to the free oxytetracycline.\n\nOnce we had established that CD complexation was able to positively influence\nthe enantioselectivity of the hydrogenation, we ran further tests with\ndifferent CDs. Moreover, the reaction was performed both on the already-formed\ncomplex and with the addition in situ of the native CDs, to investigate which\nwould work the best. The overall results are shown in the following table\n(Table 2), and selectivity is calculated based on the integrated area ratios:\n\n### Table 2\n\nMW-assisted synthesis of doxycycline starting from oxytetracycline/\u03b2-CD\ncomplex.\n\nEntry| Substrate| Conversion (%)| Yield \u03b1-Doxy (%)| Yield \u03b2-Doxy (%)  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1b| \u03b2CD solid ^a| 44.3| 4.0| 16.1  \n2b| \u03b2CD solid ^b| 60.0| 14.1| 32.2  \n3b| \u03b2CD filtrate ^b| 100| 34.0| n.d.  \n4b| \u03b2CD in situ ^b| 100| 19.1| 36.2  \n5b| RAMEB ^b| 68.3| n.d.| n.d.  \n6b| \u03b3CD ^b| 100| 26.2| 14.3  \n7b| \u03b3CD in situ ^b| 100| 5.2| 6.7  \n  \nOpen in a separate window\n\n^a 50 mg oxytetracycline, 50 mg Rh/AC 5 wt%, 2 mL H_2O, 50 \u00b0C, 5 bar H_2, 2 h.\n^b 50 mg oxytetracycline, 50 mg Rh/AC 5 wt%, 2 mL H_2O, 50 \u00b0C, 5 bar H_2, 4 h.\nn.d. = non detected.\n\nWhile both \u03b2CD and \u03b3CD can complex the substrate, the formation of these\nadducts is not favored under the reaction conditions, meaning that prior\nsynthesis is recommended. Finally, 3b was the best reaction, showing that the\ncomplex is more soluble than its components and has greater stability in\nwater. Doxycycline was easily recovered using the EtOH 50% washes. However,\nonce synthesized, it may be directly recovered and stored in complex form,\nmaking for an easier purification step. Complexation with RAMEB, albeit\nsuccessful, does not lead to the desired compound. \u03b1-Doxycycline was\nidentified by NMR spectroscopy comparing data with those obtained on an\n\u03b1-doxycycline standard (Figures S1\u2013S12).\n\n### 3.2. Supposed Mechanism Involved in the Hydrogenation Process\n\nHydrogenolysis of the C6 benzyl alcohol promoted by the heterogeneous catalyst\nwas previously documented to occur via two possible pathways [36] that can\ndeeply influence the stereoselectivity of the reaction. Having observed\ndifferent selectivity towards doxycycline epimers when CDs complexes were\nused, we propose that the one depicted in Scheme 2a is involved in\noxytetracycline hydrogenolysis. Oxytetracycline, in an acidic aqueous\nsolution, undergoes epimerization at benzylic carbon C-6. The new structure is\nhighly stabilized by a hydrogen bond formation between the two cis-hydroxyl\ngroups in positions 6 and 5, which results in a six-membered ring (Scheme 2b).\nFurther hydrogenation leads to obtaining the \u03b2-doxycycline.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nScheme 2\n\nEquilibrium between \u03b1 and \u03b2 epimers and following hydrogenation processes (a).\nHydrogen bond in a six-term cycle that involves the C6 in its \u03b2 configuration\n(b).\n\nIn presence of CDs, instead, the interaction between OH in C-6 and the\nhydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin cavity competes with that which occurs\nbetween the hydroxyls in C-6 and C-5 as a consequence of epimerization.\n\nAs shown in the energetics in Table 3, the two orientations of tetracycline\nrings are not equally possible in CD complexes. Both OXY-HCl and the\ndehydrated intermediate formed in \u03b2CD and RAMEB prefer B/C rings in the\ncavity. The inclusion of A/B rings in this orientation of tetracycline results\nin significantly lower energy states than C/D inclusion with \u03b2CD. The\nconsequence of entrapped C/D rings is that the reducible moiety is not\naccessible to the hydrogenation catalyst. As the C/D rings move out of the CD\ncavities, they become virtually freely accessible to the rhodium\nnanoparticles, but the formation of both C6-epimers of DOXY is not equally\npossible, as shown in Figure 2. The primary hydroxyl groups are blocking the\nfavorable hydrogenation position. Although both the OXY-HCL and the dehydrated\nintermediate favor the inclusion complex, in the case of RAMEB, the\ninteraction is as strong as with \u03b2CD.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 2\n\nPossible attachment of the Rh nanoparticles around C-6 (figures shows the\noptimized intermediate/CD complexes (PM6 method) with the molecular mechanics\n(MMFF94) optimized Rh nanoparticles).\n\n### Table 3\n\nThe heat of formation differences (Kcal/mol) of the complete and incomplete\ninclusion compounds between CDs and oxytetracycline, relative to the free\ncomponents.\n\nA\u2212| Ai| A+| B\u2212| Bi| B+  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n\u03b2CD/OXY-HCl| \u221238.6| \u221240.6| \u221231.2| \u221214.0| \u221225.2| \u221225.2  \nRAMEB/OXY-HCl| \u221234.7| \u221258.4| \u221225.6| \u221217.3| \u221219.0| \u221239.6  \n\u03b2CD/Dehydrated-HCl| \u221223.6| \u221220.2| \u221220.0| \u221213.2| \u221232.4| \u221222.8  \nRAMEB/Dehydrated-HCl| \u221239.3| \u221250.7| \u221224.8| \u221232.2| \u221232.0| \u221229.2  \n  \nOpen in a separate window\n\nThe reverse orientation of the tetracycline ring showed a different picture.\nAlthough the encapsulation of the A/B rings is also favored, the complete B/C\ninclusion of OXY-HCl is weaker in this orientation. While the OXY-HCl prefers\nto leave the C/D ring from the cavity in the case of RAMEB, the \u03b2CD likes to\nkeep close the OXY-HCl to the cavity. The dehydrated intermediate is more\nstable when the B/C rings are encapsulated; in the case of RAMEB, the energy\ndifferences are not significantly different. When the C/D rings are out of the\ncavity, the hydrophilic ring\u2019s high hydrophilicity and strong H-bond forming\nability keep the C/D rings fixed, and the double bond is accessible for the\ncatalyst. Unlike the \u03b2CD, the methyl groups of RAMEB can hinder the double\nbond, more from the unfavorable side, which prevents the formation of DOXYs at\nall. Although the orientation of the C/D rings of the intermediate toward the\nprimary hydroxyl rim is less favorable, in this case, the methyl substituents\nof RAMEB can also hinder the unfavorable attack of the Rh nanoparticle to the\nhydrogenation. The reverse orientation equally allows the hydrogenation from\nboth sides of the tetracycline ring system.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions\n\nA simple procedure for the synthesis of \u03b1-doxycycline starting from an\noxytetracycline/CD complex under hydrogen pressure (5 bar) using heterogeneous\ncatalysis has been described. Under MW irradiation, a 34.0% yield of\n\u03b1-doxycycline was recorded from the oxytetracycline/CD complex. Even though\nmore research is needed to reduce the amount of Rh catalyst needed, we believe\nthat this work should be useful in establishing new means of obtaining\n\u03b1-doxycycline selectively, as well as contributing to the future design of\neven more sustainable organic synthetic procedures based on heterogeneous\ncatalysis in combination with MW irradiation and green solvents.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe R&D department of Huvepharma Italy is warmly acknowledged for its\ntechnical support.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Supplementary Materials\n\nThe following are available online at\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antibiotics10091084/s1.
