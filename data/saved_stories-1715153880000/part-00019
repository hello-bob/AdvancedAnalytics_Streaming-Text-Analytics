With record construction of solar and wind in 2023,\na new era of falling fossil generation is imminent. 2023 was likely the pivot\npoint, marking peak emissions in the power sector.\n\nThe renewables revolution \u2013 led by solar and wind \u2013 is breaking records and\ndriving ever-cleaner electricity production. The world is now at a turning\npoint where solar and wind not only slow emissions growth, but actually start\nto push fossil generation into decline.\n\nIndeed, the expansion of clean capacity would have been enough to deliver a\nfall in global power sector emissions in 2023. However, drought caused a five-\nyear low in hydropower, which created a shortfall that was met in large part\nby coal. Nonetheless, the latest forecasts give confidence that 2024 will\nbegin a new era of falling fossil generation, marking 2023 as the likely peak\nof power sector emissions.\n\n  * 01\n\n#### Renewables provided 30% of global electricity for the first time\n\nIn 2023, growth in solar and wind pushed the world past 30% renewable\nelectricity for the first time. Renewables have expanded from 19% of global\nelectricity in 2000, driven by an increase in solar and wind from 0.2% in 2000\nto a record 13.4% in 2023. China was the main contributor in 2023, accounting\nfor 51% of the additional global solar generation and 60% of new global wind\ngeneration. Combined with nuclear, the world generated almost 40% of its\nelectricity from low-carbon sources in 2023. As a result, the CO2 intensity of\nglobal power generation reached a new record low, 12% lower than its peak in\n2007.\n\n  * 02\n\n#### Solar was the main supplier of electricity growth in 2023\n\nSolar is leading the energy revolution. It was the fastest-growing source of\nelectricity generation for the 19th year in a row, and surpassed wind to\nbecome the largest source of new electricity for the second year running.\nIndeed, solar added more than twice as much new electricity as coal in 2023.\nThe record surge in installations at the very end of 2023 means that 2024 is\nset for an even larger increase in solar generation.\n\n  * 03\n\n#### Hydropower fell to a five-year low, preventing a fall in emissions in\n2023\n\nDrought conditions resulted in a record fall in hydropower generation, which\ndropped to a five-year low. Under normal conditions, the clean capacity added\nduring 2023 would have been enough to enable a 1.1% fall in fossil generation.\nHowever, the shortfall in hydropower was met by an increase in coal\ngeneration, which led to a 1% increase in global power sector emissions. 95%\nof the coal generation rise in 2023 occurred in four countries that were\nseverely affected by droughts: China, India, Viet Nam and Mexico.\n\n  * 04\n\n#### Demand growth slowed in 2023, but in future it will only go up\n\nGlobal electricity demand rose to a record high in 2023, with an increase of\n627 TWh which is equivalent to adding the entire demand of Canada (+607 TWh).\nNevertheless, the 2023 increase of 2.2% was below the average for recent\nyears, due to a pronounced decrease in demand in OECD countries, notably the\nUS (-1.4%) and the EU (-3.4%). In contrast, the rapid demand growth in China\n(+6.9%) was equivalent to the total global growth in demand in 2023. More than\nhalf of the electricity demand rise in 2023 was from five technologies:\nelectric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, electrolysers, air conditioning and data\ncentres. The spread of these technologies will accelerate the growth in\nelectricity demand, but overall energy demand will decline as electrification\nis much more efficient than fossil fuels.\n\n  * 05\n\n#### A new era of declining power sector emissions is about to begin\n\nEmber forecasts fossil generation to fall slightly in 2024, leading to larger\nfalls in subsequent years. Demand growth in 2024 is expected to be higher than\nin 2023 (+968 TWh) but clean generation growth is forecast to be even greater\n(+1300 TWh), leading to a 2% fall in global fossil generation (-333 TWh).\nAlready the rollout of clean generation, led by solar and wind, has helped to\nslow the growth in fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last ten years. As\na result, half the world\u2019s economies are already at least five years past a\npeak in electricity generation from fossil fuels. OECD countries are at the\nforefront of this, with power sector emissions collectively peaking in 2007\nand falling 28% since then.\n\nThe decade ahead will see the energy transition enter a new phase. A permanent\ndecline in fossil fuel use in the power sector at a global level is now\ninevitable, leading to falling sector emissions. Clean electricity additions \u2013\nled by solar and wind \u2013 are already forecast to outpace demand growth in the\ncoming decade, securing moderate reductions in fossil fuel use and hence\nemissions, even as demand accelerates to meet the growing needs of\nelectrification and other booming technologies.\n\nFor the goal of achieving international climate change targets, this is\ncritical, with multiple analyses finding that the power sector should be the\nfirst to decarbonise \u2013 by 2035 in OECD countries, by 2045 in the rest of the\nworld. The sector is currently the highest emitting of all, producing more\nthan a third of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Clean electricity is\nalso key to decarbonising transport, heating and much of industry, by\nreplacing the fossil fuel burning that currently takes place in car and bus\nengines, boilers, furnaces and other applications. An accelerating transition\nto a clean electrified economy powered by wind, solar and other forms of clean\nenergy will also unlock benefits in areas such as economic growth, jobs, air\nquality and energy sovereignty.\n\nThe pace of emissions declines will be shaped by how quickly the build-out of\nclean power continues. There is a global consensus on the scale of ambition\nneeded. At the UN\u2019s COP28 climate change conference in December, world leaders\nreached a historic agreement to triple global renewables capacity by 2030. The\ntarget would see the world reach 60% renewable electricity by 2030, almost\nhalving power sector emissions and putting the world on a pathway aligned with\nthe 1.5C climate goal. Leaders also agreed at COP28 to double annual energy\nefficiency improvements by 2030, which will be crucial to delivering the full\npotential of electrification and avoiding runaway growth in electricity\ndemand.\n\nCountries are already demonstrating the key enablers that galvanise rapid\ngrowth in solar and wind, including high-level policy ambition, incentive\nmechanisms and flexibility solutions. The report highlights three countries \u2013\nChina, Brazil and the Netherlands \u2013 which show that despite very different\nstarting points, the combination of these approaches is delivering rapid\ntransformations of their electricity systems and preparing the way for a\nclean, electrified economy.\n\n> \"The renewables future has arrived.
