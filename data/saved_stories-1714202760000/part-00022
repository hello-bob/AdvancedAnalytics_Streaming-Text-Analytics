I believe for a number of reasons\nthat it is.\n\nLet us first consider the question from the point of view of scientific\nknowledge. It might appear that there are no essential methodological\ndifferences between astronomy and economics: scientists in both fields attempt\nto discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of\nphenomena in order to make the interconnection of these phenomena as clearly\nunderstandable as possible. But in reality such methodological differences do\nexist. The discovery of general laws in the field of economics is made\ndifficult by the circumstance that observed economic phenomena are often\naffected by many factors which are very hard to evaluate separately. In\naddition, the experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the so-\ncalled civilized period of human history has\u00e2as is well known\u00e2been largely\ninfluenced and limited by causes which are by no means exclusively economic in\nnature. For example, most of the major states of history owed their existence\nto conquest. The conquering peoples established themselves, legally and\neconomically, as the privileged class of the conquered country. They seized\nfor themselves a monopoly of the land ownership and appointed a priesthood\nfrom among their own ranks. The priests, in control of education, made the\nclass division of society into a permanent institution and created a system of\nvalues by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously,\nguided in their social behavior.\n\nBut historic tradition is, so to speak, of yesterday; nowhere have we really\novercome what Thorstein Veblen called \"the predatory phase\" of human\ndevelopment. The observable economic facts belong to that phase and even such\nlaws as we can derive from them are not applicable to other phases. Since the\nreal purpose of socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the\npredatory phase of human development, economic science in its present state\ncan throw little light on the socialist society of the future.\n\nSecond, socialism is directed towards a social-ethical end. Science, however,\ncannot create ends and, even less, instill them in human beings; science, at\nmost, can supply the means by which to attain certain ends. But the ends\nthemselves are conceived by personalities with lofty ethical ideals and\u00e2if\nthese ends are not stillborn, but vital and vigorous\u00e2are adopted and carried\nforward by those many human beings who, half unconsciously, determine the slow\nevolution of society.\n\nFor these reasons, we should be on our guard not to overestimate science and\nscientific methods when it is a question of human problems; and we should not\nassume that experts are the only ones who have a right to express themselves\non questions affecting the organization of society.\n\nInnumerable voices have been asserting for some time now that human society is\npassing through a crisis, that its stability has been gravely shattered. It is\ncharacteristic of such a situation that individuals feel indifferent or even\nhostile toward the group, small or large, to which they belong. In order to\nillustrate my meaning, let me record here a personal experience. I recently\ndiscussed with an intelligent and well-disposed man the threat of another war,\nwhich in my opinion would seriously endanger the existence of mankind, and I\nremarked that only a supra-national organization would offer protection from\nthat danger. Thereupon my visitor, very calmly and coolly, said to me: \"Why\nare you so deeply opposed to the disappearance of the human race?\"\n\nI am sure that as little as a century ago no one would have so lightly made a\nstatement of this kind. It is the statement of a man who has striven in vain\nto attain an equilibrium within himself and has more or less lost hope of\nsucceeding. It is the expression of a painful solitude and isolation from\nwhich so many people are suffering in these days. What is the cause? Is there\na way out?\n\nIt is easy to raise such questions, but difficult to answer them with any\ndegree of assurance. I must try, however, as best I can, although I am very\nconscious of the fact that our feelings and strivings are often contradictory\nand obscure and that they cannot be expressed in easy and simple formulas.\n\nMan is, at one and the same time, a solitary being and a social being. As a\nsolitary being, he attempts to protect his own existence and that of those who\nare closest to him, to satisfy his personal desires, and to develop his innate\nabilities. As a social being, he seeks to gain the recognition and affection\nof his fellow human beings, to share in their pleasures, to comfort them in\ntheir sorrows, and to improve their conditions of life. Only the existence of\nthese varied, frequently conflicting, strivings accounts for the special\ncharacter of a man, and their specific combination determines the extent to\nwhich an individual can achieve an inner equilibrium and can contribute to the\nwell-being of society. It is quite possible that the relative strength of\nthese two drives is, in the main, fixed by inheritance. But the personality\nthat finally emerges is largely formed by the environment in which a man\nhappens to find himself during his development, by the structure of the\nsociety in which he grows up, by the tradition of that society, and by its\nappraisal of particular types of behavior. The abstract concept \"society\"\nmeans to the individual human being the sum total of his direct and indirect\nrelations to his contemporaries and to all the people of earlier generations.\nThe individual is able to think, feel, strive, and work by himself; but he\ndepends so much upon society\u00e2in his physical, intellectual, and emotional\nexistence\u00e2that it is impossible to think of him, or to understand him, outside\nthe framework of society. It is \"society\" which provides man with food,\nclothing, a home, the tools of work, language, the forms of thought, and most\nof the content of thought; his life is made possible through the labor and the\naccomplishments of the many millions past and present who are all hidden\nbehind the small word \u00e2society.\u00e2\n\nIt is evident, therefore, that the dependence of the individual upon society\nis a fact of nature which cannot be abolished\u00e2just as in the case of ants and\nbees. However, while the whole life process of ants and bees is fixed down to\nthe smallest detail by rigid, hereditary instincts, the social pattern and\ninterrelationships of human beings are very variable and susceptible to\nchange. Memory, the capacity to make new combinations, the gift of oral\ncommunication have made possible developments among human being which are not\ndictated by biological necessities. Such developments manifest themselves in\ntraditions, institutions, and organizations; in literature; in scientific and\nengineering accomplishments; in works of art. This explains how it happens\nthat, in a certain sense, man can influence his life through his own conduct,\nand that in this process conscious thinking and wanting can play a part.\n\nMan acquires at birth, through heredity, a biological constitution which we\nmust consider fixed and unalterable, including the natural urges which are\ncharacteristic of the human species. In addition, during his lifetime, he\nacquires a cultural constitution which he adopts from society through\ncommunication and through many other types of influences. It is this cultural\nconstitution which, with the passage of time, is subject to change and which\ndetermines to a very large extent the relationship between the individual and\nsociety. Modern anthropology has taught us, through comparative investigation\nof so-called primitive cultures, that the social behavior of human beings may\ndiffer greatly, depending upon prevailing cultural patterns and the types of\norganization which predominate in society. It is on this that those who are\nstriving to improve the lot of man may ground their hopes: human beings are\nnot condemned, because of their biological constitution, to annihilate each\nother or to be at the mercy of a cruel, self-inflicted fate.\n\nIf we ask ourselves how the structure of society and the cultural attitude of\nman should be changed in order to make human life as satisfying as possible,\nwe should constantly be conscious of the fact that there are certain\nconditions which we are unable to modify. As mentioned before, the biological\nnature of man is, for all practical purposes, not subject to change.\nFurthermore, technological and demographic developments of the last few\ncenturies have created conditions which are here to stay. In relatively\ndensely settled populations with the goods which are indispensable to their\ncontinued existence, an extreme division of labor and a highly-centralized\nproductive apparatus are absolutely necessary. The time\u00e2which, looking back,\nseems so idyllic\u00e2is gone forever when individuals or relatively small groups\ncould be completely self-sufficient. It is only a slight exaggeration to say\nthat mankind constitutes even now a planetary community of production and\nconsumption.\n\nI have now reached the point where I may indicate briefly what to me\nconstitutes the essence of the crisis of our time. It concerns the\nrelationship of the individual to society. The individual has become more\nconscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does not experience\nthis dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force,\nbut rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic\nexistence. Moreover, his position in society is such that the egotistical\ndrives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social\ndrives, which are by nature weaker, progressively deteriorate. All human\nbeings, whatever their position in society, are suffering from this process of\ndeterioration. Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, they feel insecure,\nlonely, and deprived of the naive, simple, and unsophisticated enjoyment of\nlife. Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through\ndevoting himself to society.\n\nThe economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my\nopinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge community of\nproducers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other\nof the fruits of their collective labor\u00e2not by force, but on the whole in\nfaithful compliance with legally established rules. In this respect, it is\nimportant to realize that the means of production\u00e2that is to say, the entire\nproductive capacity that is needed for producing consumer goods as well as\nadditional capital goods\u00e2may legally be, and for the most part are, the\nprivate property of individuals.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, in the discussion that follows I shall call\n\u00e2workers\u00e2 all those who do not share in the ownership of the means of\nproduction\u00e2although this does not quite correspond to the customary use of the\nterm. The owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the\nlabor power of the worker. By using the means of production, the worker\nproduces new goods which become the property of the capitalist. The essential\npoint about this process is the relation between what the worker produces and\nwhat he is paid, both measured in terms of real value. Insofar as the labor\ncontract is \u00e2free,\u00e2 what the worker receives is determined not by the real\nvalue of the goods he produces, but by his minimum needs and by the\ncapitalists' requirements for labor power in relation to the number of workers\ncompeting for jobs. It is important to understand that even in theory the\npayment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product.\n\nPrivate capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of\ncompetition among the capitalists, and partly because technological\ndevelopment and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of\nlarger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these\ndevelopments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which\ncannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political\nsociety. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by\npolitical parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private\ncapitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the\nlegislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not\nin fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of\nthe population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists\ninevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information\n(press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most\ncases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective\nconclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.\n\nThe situation prevailing in an economy based on the private ownership of\ncapital is thus characterized by two main principles: first, means of\nproduction (capital) are privately owned and the owners dispose of them as\nthey see fit; second, the labor contract is free. Of course, there is no such\nthing as a pure capitalist society in this sense. In particular, it should be\nnoted that the workers, through long and bitter political struggles, have\nsucceeded in securing a somewhat improved form of the \u00e2free labor contract\u00e2\nfor certain categories of workers. But taken as a whole, the present day\neconomy does not differ much from \u00e2pure\u00e2 capitalism.\n\nProduction is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no provision that\nall those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find\nemployment; an \u00e2army of unemployed\u00e2 almost always exists. The worker is\nconstantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and poorly paid workers\ndo not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers' goods is\nrestricted, and great hardship is the consequence. Technological progress\nfrequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden\nof work for all. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among\ncapitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and\nutilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions.\nUnlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of\nthe social consciousness of individuals which I mentioned before.\n\nThis crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. Our\nwhole educational system suffers from this evil. An exaggerated competitive\nattitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive\nsuccess as a preparation for his future career.\n\nI am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely\nthrough the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an\neducational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an\neconomy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized\nin a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs\nof the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to\nwork and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The\neducation of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate\nabilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his\nfellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present\nsociety.\n\nNevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet\nsocialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete\nenslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism requires the\nsolution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it\npossible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic\npower, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How\ncan the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic\ncounterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?\n\nClarity about the aims and problems of socialism is of greatest significance\nin our age of transition. Since, under present circumstances, free and\nunhindered discussion of these problems has come under a powerful taboo, I\nconsider the foundation of this magazine to be an important public service.\n\nAddeddate\n\n    2010-06-30 23:32:37\n\nIdentifier\n\n    AlbertEinsteinWhySocialism\n\nIdentifier-ark\n\n    ark:/13960/t79s2gm40\n\nOcr\n\n    ABBYY FineReader 8.0\n\nPpi\n\n    300\n\n##\n\nplus-circle Add Review\n\ncomment\n\nReviews\n\nThere are no reviews yet.
