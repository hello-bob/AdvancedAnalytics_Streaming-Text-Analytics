Review\ncopies of the device were allegedly sent to 50 people this past week.\n\nAs confirmed by Nick in his video, the UnlockSwitch works as expected, and, in\nits current state, acts like an exact clone of the MIG Switch. A teardown\nshows that this looks like a very close clone of the MIG Switch.\n\nImportant Update: Nick Moses and team are now worried this could actually be a\nsemi-elaborate scam, using Youtube reviewers as \u201cbait\u201d with reskinned MIG\nSwitch flashcarts, to bring preorders for a non existing product. See below\nfor details\n\n## What are MIG Switch and UnlockSwitch?\n\nThe MIG Switch (and the UnlockSwitch) looks and feels like a regular Nintendo\nSwitch cartridge, but allows you to load multiple games in an embedded SD\nCard. Switch between games is done by ejecting, then re-inserting the\nflashcart into the device.\n\nThe youtuber confirmed the UnlockSwitch works as of Nintendo Switch Firmware\n18.0.0.\n\nThe MIG Switch (and now, its clones) is advertised as a backup and development\ndevice for the Nintendo Switch, but its practical use case is probably going\nto be piracy for the most part. For people looking to pirate games, the system\nmight be more convenient than existing modchip solutions, as it doesn\u2019t\nrequire hacking the console, or soldering any modchip. It is, however, very\nlimited in scope in my opinion, allowing only for piracy, but none of the more\n\u201clegit\u201d hacking use cases such as homebrew, plugins, custom firmwares, etc...\n\n## UnlockSwitch \u2013 How is it different from the MIG Switch?\n\nDifferences between the MIG Switch and UnlockSwitch, based on Nick Moses\u2019s\ninitial review, are mostly cosmetic. The UnlockSwitch looks and feels more\nlike some official Nintendo product, shipping in a box that is the same size\nas Nintendo Switch games. The cartridge itself is apparently a bit thicker\n(also longer), and in his tests, Nick mentioned having to apply a bit more\npressure to insert the UnlockSwitch.\n\nThe review units are apparently not the final product though, and UnlockSwitch\nhave claimed they will be able to differentiate their product\u2019s functionality\nfrom Mig Switch, for example by including a button that would allow switching\nbetween games without having to eject the cartridge every single time. People\nhave shown concerns that the operating mode of having to constantly eject and\nre-insert the MIG Switch to cycle through games could induce some wear and\ntear on the console.\n\nAs for now, legit folks on the scene such as Nick have started confirming the\nUnlockSwitch is a legit product. I still personally feel that the concept of\nthe MIG Switch in itself is a flawed idea, compared to fully hacking your\nconsole. However, at the right price point, this might be an ok accessory, and\nit seems like the UnlockSwitch could bring the pricing of these devices down\n(they claim the product will sell for $39, compared to the $60+ of the MIG\nSwitch). This could be a problem for the MIG Switch\u2019s reputation, as not\neveryone has even received their units (ordered several months ago) yet.\n\n## An important update: MIG Switch team react \u2013 say UnlockSwitch is a scam\n\nDeadspecimen posted an updated video, including a response from MIG Switch.\n(video below)\n\nMIG Switch team claim that the UnlockSwitch is not a clone, but actually an\nold production batch of the MIG Switch itself, that has been reskinned by\nscammers. They say UnlockSwitch don\u2019t actually have a product, but just sent\nthat small batch of re-skinned MIG Switch flashcarts to a select group of\nreviewers, in order to build hype for preorders. According to MIG Switch team,\npeople who preorder the UnlockSwitch will not receive anything. Of course, as\naccurately mentioned by DeadSpecimen on his video, MIG Switch have vested\ninterest in talking their competition down, but what they\u2019re stating is also a\nlikely possibility (they did send a verification tool to DeadSpecimen and Nick\nMoses, which allegedly confirmed that the chips are actually MIG Switch chips.\nNobody except MIG Switch can actually confirm if this is true, so that\u2019s no\nproof for anybody else).\n\nFrom MIG Switch to Nick Moses & team:\n\n> \u201cWe will email customers this week, to warn them to not purchase, or they\n> will get scammed. After, if they don\u2019t listen, their problem, we warned\n> them.\u201d\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ll stand by what I\u2019ve said above: I don\u2019t think these products\nare really worth it, compared to actually hacking your console with a proven,\ncheap modchip such as the picofly. In any case, be careful where you spend\nyour money.\n\nThanks to DeadSpecimen for the tip!\n\n#### Rumor: \u201cUnlockSwitch\u201d claim they have reverse engineered the MIG Switch\nand have a clone under way\n\nThis could be a late April Fools' prank, or simply a whole bunch of nothing,\nbut following the distribution of MIG Switch retail models, we're already\nseeing a claim that the device has been reverse engineered, and that clones\nare being produced, under the name UnlockSwitch. This rumor is to...\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\n#### MIG Switch updates: production delays and new firmware revision\n\nThe \"russian\" team behind the MIG Switch piracy cartridge for the Nintendo\nSwitch have been sporadically posting updates. The vast majority of people who\npreordered the chip haven't received it yet, and it seems distributors\nthemselves haven't received the flashcart. Earlier this week, the MIG Switch\nofficial website posted an...\n\nMarch 1, 2024\n\n#### The MIG Switch works as advertised for the most part, but concerns remain\naround ban risks\n\nReviewers have started receiving their copies of the MIG Switch flashcart for\nNintendo Switch. Most of the folks who have received their review copies\nconfirmed the device works as expected (it will run Switch game \"backups\" on\nany Switch model), with one notable exception of a MIG Switch cart that...\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nTags: MIG SwitchNick MosesUnlockSwitch\n\nwololo\n\nWe are constantly looking for guest bloggers at wololo.net.
