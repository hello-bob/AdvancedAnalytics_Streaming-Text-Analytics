She is currently on a road trip across Europe, creating and\nleaving sculptures along the way.\n\nView more articles by Rima Khalek\n\nJune 11th, 2021October 14th, 2022\n\nTake me to the Steps\n\nMany people around the world eat insects without batting a lash, gagging, or\nthinking of childhood dares. They eat insects as snacks or main dishes as an\nabundant source of protein, healthy fats and minerals. Raising and harvesting\ninsects for human consumption requires considerably fewer resources than\nlivestock does, and releases much less greenhouse gases.\n\nThere are more than 1,900 edible insects on Earth. In this article we will\nfocus on three easily accessible ones: crickets, mealworms, and waxworms.\nWe\u2019ll use a technique to get them cleaned and cooked that works well with many\nother insects too. How you prepare them after is completely up to your\ncreative self.\n\n## Basic Starting Point\n\nWith live insects, it is best to put them in the refrigerator for at least an\nhour or until you are ready to use them. This will immobilize them by slowing\ntheir metabolism, which helps in the collecting and cleaning process. If you\nprefer, you can place them in the freezer for an hour, which will kill them,\nand then you can proceed without fear of reanimation.\n\n### Crickets\n\nFigure A\n\nPlace the crickets (Figure A) in the freezer for an hour to eliminate the\nchance of any escape artists. Then pick them out of their container, being\nsure to leave any squished ones behind, and clean them by rinsing under cool\nwater.\n\n### Mealworms\n\nMealworms are the larvae from the mealworm beetle. They have a very earthy\nflavor. They generally come in a bag with newspaper in it for them to crawl\naround in.\n\nFigure B\n\nFirst, empty the mealworms into a deep bowl, something they can\u2019t crawl up and\nout of, and remove them from the newspaper (Figure B).\n\nFigure C\n\nNext, clean them up. I like to do this while they are still alive and a little\nslow from the fridge. You will find that there will be plenty of shed skin and\na few dead worms, which are easy to find because they are generally darker in\ncolor (Figure C).\n\nA trick that I found that is a huge help is blowing. Go outside where you can\nmake a bit of a mess, put a handful in a shallow bowl and blow. You will blow\nall their shed skin away. After all the dead and shed skin are separated, give\nthem a nice rinse and stick them in the fridge or freezer for an hour.\n\n### Waxworms\n\nFigure D\n\nWaxworms (Figure D) are the caterpillar larvae of the wax moth. They have a\nvery neutral flavor and take on what you cook them with.\n\nFigure EFigure F\n\nWaxworks are pretty easy to clean. If they arrive in sawdust, take a large\nstrainer and sift (Figure E). Some may squeeze through but it is a pretty\npainless process of cleaning. Pick out any black dead ones or ones that look\nlike they are on their way out (Figure F). Give them a nice rinse and put them\nback in the fridge for an hour.\n\n## Project Steps\n\n### Cooking\n\nNext\n\nBoil a pot of salted water or prepare stock (savory or sweet). You\u2019ll drain\nthe insects quickly, so be ready\n\n### Put in your insects\n\nNextPrevious\n\nFor crickets, set your timer for 2 minutes. For mealworms or waxworms, 1\nminute.\n\nNextPrevious\n\nWhen time is up, drain them, put them in a bowl, and quickly put them in the\nfridge to cool, about 15 minutes. Don\u2019t rinse them.\n\n### When the insects are cooled\n\nNextPrevious\n\nplace them on a dehydrator sheet on top of the tray and dehydrate them until\nthey are fully dry but not crunchy.\n\nIf you are planning to roast them, you can skip the dehydrator and stick them\ndirectly onto a baking sheet and into the oven. Set the temperature to 200o F\nfor 2 hours or until desired crispiness.\n\n### Store your crickets\n\nNextPrevious\n\nStore your crickets in a mason jar until ready to use; put mealworms and\nwaxworms in a vacuum-sealed bag or Ziploc bag with air removed. Keep in the\nrefrigerator or freezer until ready to use. Enjoy!\n\n### Meal Time\n\nPrevious\n\nCooking with insects is easier than you might think! It doesn\u2019t always have to\nbe whole insects, dried out and crispy. Here are a few recipes you can make\nright now.\n\n#### Mealworm Flapjacks\n\n(UK style, not pancakes) A sweet bar with a savory punch, thanks to mealworms.\n\n#### Mealworm Margarita\n\nIf you didn\u2019t tell your guests, they would probably have no idea their\nmargarita rims were coated in mealworm. You probably should tell them though.\n\n#### Mealworm Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\nA great way to get people to try their first insect-infused meal. Nobody turns\ndown cookies!\n\n#### Cricket Flour Almond and Goji Berry Energy Bars\n\nPerfect for a snack in your pack. These energy bars use cricket flour for an\nadditional protein punch.\n\n#### Cricket Flour Brownies\n\nJust like regular brownies, but made with the protein of the future, crickets.\n\n#### Cricket Flour Pizza Dough\n\nThe world\u2019s most popular food can be made with cricket flour as well!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis article appeared in Make: Volume 71.
