Previous analyses have shown how orbital\n> evolution induced by this object can explain the origins of a broad\n> assortment of exotic orbits, ranging from those characterized by high\n> perihelia to those with extreme inclinations. In this work, we shift the\n> focus toward a more conventional class of TNOs, and consider the observed\n> census of long-period, nearly planar, Neptune-crossing objects as a\n> hitherto-unexplored probe of the Planet 9 hypothesis. To this end, we carry\n> out comprehensive N-body simulations that self-consistently model\n> gravitational perturbations from all giant planets, the Galactic tide, as\n> well as passing stars, stemming from initial conditions that account for the\n> primordial giant planet migration and sun's early evolution within a star\n> cluster. Accounting for observational biases, our results reveal that the\n> orbital architecture of this group of objects aligns closely with the\n> predictions of the P9-inclusive model. In stark contrast, the P9-free\n> scenario is statistically rejected at a \\sim5\\,\\sigma confidence-level.\n> Accordingly, this work introduces a new line of evidence supporting the\n> existence of Planet 9 and further delineates a series of observational\n> predictions poised for near-term resolution.\n\nComments:| 11 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical\nJournal Letters  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.11594 [astro-ph.EP]  \n(or arXiv:2404.11594v1 [astro-ph.EP] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.11594arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Konstantin Batygin [view email] [v1] Wed, 17 Apr 2024 17:45:39 UTC\n(4,271 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Generation of Low-Inclination, Neptune-Crossing\nTNOs by Planet Nine, by Konstantin Batygin and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nastro-ph.EP\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\nastro-ph\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
