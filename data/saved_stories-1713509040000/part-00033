A new stage musical reclaims\nhim as a hero, although questions remain over his story's tragic ending.\n\nIn the aftermath of his unconventional voyage, Larry Walters assured the\nAmerican public he wasn't actually a crackpot who had risked life and limb\nwith a hare-brained scheme that was dreamed up on a whim.\n\nNo - taking flight had been a lifelong ambition, he told interviewers\nafterwards.\n\nBut he had been rejected by the US Air Force because of bad eyesight, so\ncarried out years of careful research to make his dream come true in his own\npeculiarly homespun way.\n\nWhen he came back down to Earth - somehow unscathed after floating in the\nchair across the approach to LAX airport and landing in power lines - Walters'\nescapade caused a minor sensation.\n\nIn an interview on David Letterman's TV show, he tried to explain how serious\nhis plan had been - but his references to his \"craft\" and \"ground crew\" failed\nto quell the laughter from the audience.\n\nThe craft was an ordinary piece of garden furniture, and the ground crew were\na few friends and his fianc\u00e9e in her small back yard.\n\nJosh Bird\n\nCharlie McCullagh and Evelyn Hoskins play Larry and fianc\u00e9e Carol in 42\nBalloons\n\n\"When people were laughing at him, he said, 'I knew what I was doing',\" says\nJack Godfrey, who has written the musical about the man nicknamed Lawnchair\nLarry.\n\n\"He says multiple times in the interview, which is something that really\nsticks with me and is in the show, 'I knew what I was doing'.\n\n\"Even though he does acknowledge the absurdity of some of the things, I think\nhe's saying, it might have seemed ridiculous, but if you really look at every\nstep of the plan, everything was organised and carefully arranged and it\nwasn't just a careless thing.\n\n\"He was a pilot, not just a guy sitting in a chair. He was actually a pilot -\nin his head.\"\n\nIndeed, Walters did have everything planned out. He had calculated how many\nballoons he needed, attached 13 plastic jugs of water to his chair as ballast,\nand took an air pistol to burst the balloons to control his descent.\n\nHowever, not everything went according to plan.\n\n## Aircraft sightings\n\nLarry ended up soaring much higher than expected, losing a pair of glasses\noverboard as he shot up to 16,000ft (4,880m). Two commercial aircraft reported\nsightings to air traffic control.\n\nAfter shooting out seven balloons, he accidentally dropped the gun before the\nremaining balloons started to deflate and he landed unharmed after about 45\nminutes.\n\nLarry's initial fame may not have lasted much longer than his flight, but his\nexploits have continued to hold an unlikely fascination for four decades.\n\nHe has inspired numerous cluster ballooning copycats and a 2003 film starring\nRhys Ifans, while the balloon idea was taken to new heights in Pixar's 2009\nmovie Up.\n\nHe has now made it across the Atlantic thanks to the musical 42 Balloons,\nwhich opens at the Lowry theatre in Salford, Greater Manchester, on Thursday.\n\n\"There's something about the story that I really connected with,\" its writer\nand composer says.\n\nSeeing someone achieve an apparently far-fetched life goal is inspiring,\nGodfrey explains. The 31-year-old wrote the show while working part-time as a\nteacher and harbouring his own more sedate ambition.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe story may sound familiar to those who have seen Pixar's movie Up (premiere\npicture from 2009)\n\n\"I had just moved to London and I had this big dream of becoming a writer and\nI had people in my life who were doubting me - in a way that is quite natural.\nMy family and friends are all supportive, but I don't come from a theatre\nbackground.\n\n\"So when I discovered the story about this guy who had a dream and people\ndoubted him or he had obstacles in his way... I thought, that's such an\ninspirational story of someone who is going to overcome the odds and make his\ndream come true by whatever means necessary.\n\n\"[It's] a real underdog story that I really connected with at the time because\nI thought, this guy's just like me. There's something about it that really\ninspired me.\n\n\"And I thought, maybe this is something that other people will connect with.\nIt feels like a universal story, the idea of having a dream.\"\n\nBy writing about Larry's dream, Godfrey has gone some way to achieving his\nown, and is now a rising star of musical theatre.\n\n42 Balloons, his first professional show, has had notable backing. Producers\nAndy and Wendy Barnes also discovered hit show Six, while the Lowry gave early\nsupport to Operation Mincemeat - which has just won the Olivier Award for best\nnew musical.\n\nGodfrey is also preparing for his second professional show, called Babies,\nwhich will open at London's Other Palace theatre at the end of May.\n\nJosh Bird\n\nThe cast in rehearsals for 42 Balloons\n\nMeanwhile, someone else to have been inspired by Lawnchair Larry is Mark\nBarry, who started investigating the story and eventually came to act as his\nfamily's spokesman.\n\nHe set out to correct some of the misconceptions about Larry.\n\n\"I really felt like people thought he was a kind of a lunatic, and I wanted to\nlet people know that this was not Larry,\" he says. \"This guy was us. The only\ndifference was he pursued his dream.\n\n\"He was a dreamer who fulfilled his dreams, unlike most of us, who just sit in\nour chair. He actually pursued it.\"\n\nBarry, a pilot and simulator engineer from Arizona, tracked down the actual\nlawnchair, which Larry had given to a child from the neighbourhood where he\nlanded. The chair is now in the US National Air and Space Museum at the\nSmithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.\n\nBarry isn't involved in the musical, although the chair's rediscovery is part\nof the plot. As is Larry's death at the age of 44 in 1993, 11 years after his\nflight.\n\nAt the time, his mother told US media that he shot himself in the heart after\nhiking to his favourite spot in the Angeles National Forest. It was widely\naccepted to have been a suicide. That's the storyline in the show.\n\n## New evidence?\n\nHowever, his mother later told the New Yorker there were suspicious\ncircumstances. There were drug smugglers in the area, and Larry was found with\nthe gun in his right hand, whereas he was left-handed, she said. In the same\narticle, Larry's sister dismissed the suggestion of foul play.\n\nBarry now claims to have uncovered evidence that Larry's death was not suicide\n- but doesn't want to give further details until he's finished writing a book\nabout Larry's life and death.\n\nSo, part of Larry's story may still be left to be told.\n\nWhatever the truth, he seems destined to go down in history as a heroic\nmaverick of everyday American life.\n\nLarry told the LA Times: \"I didn't think that by fulfilling my goal in life,\nmy dream, that would create such a stir - and make people laugh.\"\n\n42 Balloons is at The Lowry in Salford until 19 May.\n\n## Sunset Boulevard equals Olivier Awards record\n\nTheatre\n\nManchester\n\nMusical theatre\n\nRelated\n\n## Weekly quiz: How did Sunset Boulevard put itself on the map at the\nOliviers?\n\n7 hrs ago\n\nWorld\n\n## Town set to launch Rik Mayall comedy festival\n\n2 days ago\n\nHereford & Worcester\n\n## Community arts space upgrade under way\n\n3 days ago\n\nDorset\n\nMore\n\n10 hrs ago\n\n## Never give up, says final-place marathon runner\n\nFilm of Lynda Elmore finishing last in the Manchester Marathon has been\nwatched by millions.\n\n10 hrs ago\n\nEngland\n\n18 hrs ago\n\n## Disabled actor says Olivier win signals progress\n\nAmy Trigg says in the past people in the industry had been \"against casting\ndisabled actors\".\n\n18 hrs ago\n\nEssex\n\n1 day ago\n\n## Viagra and ring found after heiress drowned - court\n\nA cleaner for an heiress who drowned in a pool says she found the items at the\ncouple's marital home.\n\n1 day ago\n\nManchester\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Club backs 'Taylor Swift tax' to help small venues\n\nA Manchester live music club backs a \u00a31 tax on stadium shows to help\nstruggling grassroots venues.\n\n2 days ago\n\nManchester\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Arena victim's mum walking from Manchester to London to demand new law\n\nFigen Murray says five years on from Martyn's Law being proposed, \"legislation\nstill hasn\u2019t been tabled\".\n\n2 days ago\n\nManchester\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
