Hol. Born.\n\nWhile the company only lasted for a few years \u2014 and they only produced a\nhandful of models \u2014 their distinctive designs (for both their cases and their\nhardware & software choices) are worthy of being remembered.\n\nJust to give you a good example... this is the Holborn 9100 (and connected\nterminals):\n\nI mean. Wow! Just look at that monitor! That distinctive neck just screams\n\u201c1950s futurism\u201d... and I absolutely love it.\n\nOk. Let\u2019s back up a moment.\n\nThe company was founded in Hengelo (a town in The Netherlands, near the German\nborder). This is their first office space:\n\nPictured below are the founders of the company \u2014 Dick Gerdzen (left) and Hans\nPolak (right) \u2014 surrounded by a bunch of Holborn computers and terminals.\n\nNow. The computers. Let\u2019s tackle them in chronological order.\n\n### The Holborn 9100\n\nThe first computer from Holborn was the 9100 (and the accompanying 9120\nterminal). Pictured on the left in the picture below.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Hack42 Museum\n\nNote that the 9100 computer portion (where the CPU, drives, etc. were\ncontained) is the size of a mini-fridge or a low profile filing cabinet (with\nthe 9120 terminal sitting on top).\n\nYeah. The big filing cabinet thing on the floor? That\u2019s the primary computer\nunit.\n\nThe specs of this system were as follows:\n\n  * Zilog Z80 CPU @ 3.5 MHz\n\n  * 72 KB of RAM (expandable to 220 KB)\n\n  * 8 inch floppy drives\n\nWhich brings us to the Operating System... it was 100% custom and in-house\ndeveloped. The Holborn OS was a multi-user system, booted entirely from ROM,\nwhich allowed multiple Holborn 9120 terminals to connect to a single Holborn\n9100 computer (\u201cServer\u201d).\n\nOne extra (and optional) feature of the 9100... it had a photosensitive light\npen which could be used as a pointing device. Not a mouse, but a light pen.\n\nWhat did the Holborn Operating System look like in practice? How did it work?\nHow, exactly, did the light pen work with the included software?\n\nThose are questions I\u2019ve had for many years... yet, despite hunting high and\nlow, have never found so much as a single picture showcasing the Holborn OS in\nany readable way. Due to the Holborn OS only being available in ROM on the\n9100 itself... no known digital archival copy exists.\n\nIn the end, only roughly 200 Holborn 9100 units were sold. (Though that number\nis debated... more on that in a moment.)\n\n### The Holborn 7100\n\nThis was a simplified (and cheaper) version of the 9100. Instead of supporting\na whole office worth of connected terminals (as with the 9100), the 7100 only\nsupported two connected terminals (users) at once.\n\nIt looked like the 9100. Acted like the 9100. Just with... less.\n\nIt is unknown how well this model sold. It is assumed that it did not sell\nwell.\n\n### The Holborn 6100\n\nIn 1982, the Holborn Computer company had to make some tough decisions.\n\nTheir Holborn OS (booted from ROM), was not proving popular. And the CP/M\noperating system (from Gary Kildall\u2019s Digital Research in Pacific Grove,\nCalifornia) was rapidly gaining in popularity.\n\nLuckily the architecture already in use by Holborn computers (the Z80) had a\nnative version of CP/M.\n\nThus the lower priced, and smaller footprint, Holborn 6100 line was born. Same\nZ80 CPU, and now with a maximum 192 KB of RAM (slightly less than the 9100)...\nbut, this time, booting the CP/M operating system off disk.\n\nNo more booting from ROM. No more in-house developed operating system.\n\nThis is the Holborn 6140 with the connected 6110 terminal. See? Much smaller\nthan that gigantic 9100 mini-fridge. But still retained that fantastically\ninteresting terminal design.\n\nHere is a shot of the Holborn 6100\u2019s screen, running CP/M.\n\nImage courtesy Technisch museum\n\nHow many of these machines shipped? Reports put it somewhere in the ballpark\nof around 100. Total.\n\nThough the lack of information makes this fact difficult to confirm.\nRegardless, it was not exactly selling like hotcakes.\n\n### The Holborn 6500\n\nThe final computer designed by Holborn was the ill-fated 6500.\n\nIn the 6500, Holborn removed the keyboard from the terminal body (making it a\ndetached keyboard), and filled the base of the terminal with the computer guts\n(thus eliminating the need for the separate computer housing used in earlier\nmodels). As shown in this advertisement for the \u201cnot yet released\u201d 6500:\n\nAnd here is a shot of the inside of the Holborn 6500, with the top of the case\nlifted up to show the internals.\n\nImage courtesy: Inexhibit\n\nUnfortunately Holborn Computers declared bankruptcy in April of 1983... before\nshipping the 6500.\n\n### The End of Holborn\n\nAnd here is where things become increasingly sad for the company.\n\nWhen Holborn went bankrupt, investigators determined that only 50 units were\nsold of the 9100 and 7100 combined. And that the company had over 3.5 million\nguilders in debt. (Guilders were the currency in use in The Netherlands prior\nto changing to the Euro. Some quick math tells us that 3.5 Million guilders\nwould be roughly equal to $7 Million USD.)\n\nWould the 6500 model have been enough to save the company? Who knows.\nConsidering the poor sales up till then, and the relatively massive debt (when\ncompared to sales), it seems unlikely.\n\nBut one thing is for certain... those are some seriously funky (and awesome)\nlooking machines. So I\u2019m sure glad they tried.\n\nIf you ever run across a Holborn, count yourself lucky. These are some of the\nhardest computers to find nowadays. Considering that only a few hundred were\never sold, you aren\u2019t likely to stumble across them at a flea market or eBay.\n\nWith that, I leave you with some pictures of Holborn computers in action.\nBecause they're just so darned cool looking.\n\nJoin the Lunduke Community\n\nTo read more articles like this, sign up and join my community today\n\n16\n\nView All\n\n8\n\nWhat else you may like...\n\nVideos\n\nPodcasts\n\nPosts\n\nArticles\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nMay 04, 2024\n\nOn the Z-80 Holborn Computers\n\nRemembering the (very) funky Holborn computers of the early 1980s.\n\nThe full article: https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5588902/1950s-sci-fi-style-\ncomputers-powered-by-a-z80-built-in-holland\n\n00:14:04\n\n11\n\nView All\n\n2\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nMay 04, 2024\n\nOn The History of Screensavers: 1961 - 1990\n\nFrom Sci-Fi novels and Atari... to old Macs and Flying Toasters.\n\nThe full article: https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5588984/the-definitive-\nhistory-of-screensavers-1961-1990\n\n00:18:01\n\n9\n\nView All\n\n2\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nMay 03, 2024\n\nMozilla: A Bully from the Very Beginning\n\nThe story of how \"Firefox\" was named.\n\nRead the full article: https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5577706/why-is-firefox-\ncalled-firefox\n\n00:19:45\n\n10\n\nView All\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nNovember 22, 2023\n\nThe futility of Ad-Blockers\n\nAds are filling the entirety of the Web -- websites, podcasts, YouTube videos,\netc. -- at an increasing rate.

Zip disks. Hard disks.\n\nThese sorts of spinning, magnetic storage mediums have been critical to\nseveral decades of computers. It\u2019s almost hard to imagine the computers of the\n1970s, 80s, and 90s without floppy and hard disks (and other magnetic drives).\n\nBut how, exactly, did they come into existence?\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the very first of such devices... and their\ninspiration.\n\n### 1946 - The Mail-a-Voice\n\nWe\u2019ll begin our journey with the 1946 release of the Brush Mail-a-Voice.\n\nThe Mail-a-Voice. Be Honest. You want one.\n\nA truly fascinating device, the Mail-a-Voice looked like a phonograph...\nexcept it used a paper disc that was coated in magnetic material. You could\nthen record up to 3 minutes of audio on a single paper disk (which would spin\nat 20 rotations per minute)... and then fold the paper disc up and mail it to\nsomeone inside a standard envelope.\n\nThus the \u201cMail-a-Voice\u201d.\n\nThis device didn\u2019t store computer data itself -- it was only for audio -- but\nit did inspire engineers who were working on cheap data storage for\ncomputers...\n\n### February, 1948 - Andrew Booth\u2019s Spinning Drum\n\nIn a 1947 trip to the USA, Andrew Booth (who was working on his own computer\ndesign), had the chance to see the \u201cMail-a-Voice\u201d in action.\n\nSince Booth needed a good, inexpensive storage medium for his computer... he\nattempted to build a similar device using a flat, paper, magnetic disk. What\nwas, essentially, a first attempt at what we would now call a \u201cFloppy Disk\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, it didn\u2019t quite work. Booth found that he needed to spin the\npaper disk quite a bit faster in order to make it viable as a data storage\nmechanism... and he had a hard time keeping the paper disk flat.\n\nIn fact, as Booth upped the RPM to 3,000 \u2014 which is what he determined he\nneeded \u2014 the paper disk itself started to disintegrate. Booth would later\ncomment:\n\n> \u201cI suppose I really invented the floppy disc, it was a real flop!\u201d\n\nSo he abandoned that approach and, instead, decided to use a brass drum. Why\nbrass? Because brass is a bit less likely to disintegrate than... paper.\n\nIt's brass, baby! BRASS!\n\nThis system worked. His brass, rotating drum (with a magnetic coating), had a\n2 inch diameter and could store 10 bits per inch.\n\nYeah. 10 bits. Per inch.\n\nNot exactly massive amounts of storage. But, hey, it was a start! And it\ndidn\u2019t disintegrate! Huzzah!\n\n### Improving the magnetic drum\n\nWith the first prototype working, Booth set about improving his magnetic,\nrotating drum storage device. The final version ended up being able to store\n256 words of either 20 or 21 bits each (different sources cite different\nvalues here and there does not appear to be consensus on if it was 20 or 21\nbit words).\n\nIn modern terms: This would be equivalent to roughly 5 kilobits of data\nstorage. Give or take.\n\nThis storage drum was put to use on the ARC (the Automatic Relay Computer).\n\nBooth working on the Automatic Relay Computer.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the ARC could utilize that storage drum to handle\n50 numbers and could load a program consisting of 300 individual instructions.\n\nIt wasn't exactly a \u201cHard Disk Drive\u201d... more of a \u201cHard Drum Drive\u201d.\n\nEither way... Pretty darn cool for the 1940s.\n\n### 1956 - The First \u201cHard Disk Drive\u201d\n\nOver the years that followed, this idea was refined and improved. The rotating\ndrum was abandoned for hard, magnetic platters \u2014 ones sturdy enough to handle\nmuch higher RPMs (certainly much sturdier than paper!)... and thus leading to\nfaster data access.\n\nThese improvements eventually leading to the 1956 release of the IBM Model 350\nDisk Storage Unit for the IBM 305 RAMAC computer.\n\nIBM Model 350 Disk Storage Unit\n\nThe Model 350 Hard Disk Drive, in a base configuration, could store roughly\n3.75 MB \u2014 all contained in a cabinet 5 feet long, 2 1/2 feet deep, and 5 1/2\nfeet tall \u2014 with platters spinning at 1,200 RPM.\n\nAnd all thanks to a voice dictation device built for mailing 3 minutes of\naudio on a folded-up piece of paper.\n\nRead full Article\n\n16\n\nView All\n\n3\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nMay 06, 2024\n\nWho (really) created the \"Byte\"?\n\nAnd what is the REAL definition of term?\n\nKilobytes (KB). Megabytes (MB). Gigabytes (GB).\n\nWe use these storage measurements every single, gosh-darned day. And most of\nus feel like we know exactly what they mean. But do we really?\n\nDo we really \u2014 truly \u2014 know what a \u201cByte\u201d is... and its origin? I mean... who\ncame up with the term \u201cByte\u201d, anyway?\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to look over the history of the term. If, for no other\nreason, than to feel smarter than most other nerds.\n\n### What is a \u201cByte\u201d?\n\nIf you ask Mr. Google, a Byte is exactly 8 Bits.\n\nMr. Google wouldn't lie... right?\n\nOk. Great. 8 Bits = 1 Byte.\n\nSo what is a Bit?\n\nThat part is simple.\n\nA Bit is the smallest unit of information for a digital computer. A Bit can\nhave two possible values... 0 or 1. It is a boolean. A binary.\n\nMany people believe \u201cBit\u201d is short for \u201cBite\u201d. You find this in many computer\nhistory books. This little tidbit has been repeated so often, many believe it.\nHowever, like many such oft-repeated anecdotes in computing... it\u2019s hogwash.\n\nIn fact, \u201cBit\u201d is an acronym for \u201cBinary Information Digit\u201d. Squish that\nphrase together and you get \u201cBit\u201d.\n\n### Fun factoids about the origin of the \u201cBit\u201d\n\nThe first usage of the word \u201cbit\u201d, when talking about a type of data in\nreference to computing, was by Vannevar Bush. He published an articled\nentitled \u201cInstrumental Analysis\u201d in the October, 1936 issue of \u201cAmerican\nMathematical Society\u201d. In it he used the phrase \u201cbits of information\u201d when\ntalking about punch cards.\n\nHowever...\n\n\u201cBit\u201d was commonly used in Middle English to refer to \u201ca mouthful\u201d or a\n\u201cmorsel\u201d of food. (This is the origin of why many believe \u201cBit\u201d is short for\n\u201cBite\u201d... even though it isn\u2019t.) As such, Vannevar Bush may not have actually\nbeen thinking about a \u201cBit\u201d as a \u201cBinary digit\u201d... instead he may simply have\nthought \u201cthis is a morsel of data\u201d. Also worth noting... Bush never actually\ndefines what a \u201cbit\u201d is. Making it likely that he was simply using the word\n\u201cbit\u201d in the Middle English way.\n\nThe first \u2014 distinctly verifiable \u2014 usage of \u201cBit\u201d in this way is by John\nTukey. From \u201cA Mathematical Theory of Communication\u201d written by C. E. Shannon\nin 1949:\n\n> \u201cThe choice of a logarithmic base corresponds to the choice of a unit for\n> measuring information. If the base 2 is used the resulting units may be\n> called binary digits, or more briefly bits, a word suggested by J. W. Tukey.\n> A device with two stable positions, such as a relay or a flip-flop circuit,\n> can store one bit of information.\u201d\n\nThere you have it. More information about the origin of the term \u201cbit\u201d than\nyou ever wanted to know.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.\n\nOk. Great.\n\nSo, in short, a Bit is a 0 or 1. And a Byte is a group of 8 Bits. Easy.\n\n### Not so fast there, sport!\n\nWhile the Byte being 8 Bits is commonly accepted today... that was not always\nthe case. Not by a long shot!\n\nIn fact, there are two competing stories for who created the term \u201cByte\u201d...\nand neither of them were referring to a set of 8 Bits!\n\nSeriously!\n\n### Werner Buchholz\u2019s 6 Bits\n\nThe most often cited creator of the term \u201cByte\u201d is Werner Buchholz \u2014 who used\nthe term, in 1956, to refer to a grouping of 6 Bits when working on the IBM\nStretch Super computer.\n\nMan sitting at IBM Stretch console. Image source: computer-history.info.\n\nA \u201c6 Bit\u201d Byte was common in those days. In fact, Braille was a 6 Bit encoding\nof characters for the blind. And many of the early computers (from IBM and\nothers) used 6 Bit groupings to encode character data.\n\n6 Bits -- not 8 Bits -- per Byte.\n\nHowever (you knew there had to be a \u201chowever\u201d)...\n\n### Louis G. Dooley\u2019s N Bits\n\nAround that same time (1956 or so), Louis Dooley first used the word \u201cByte\u201d to\nrefer to an undefined grouping of \u201cBits\u201d. But, typically, used as \u201c4 Bits\u201d.\n\nThat's right. Not 8 Bits. Not 6 Bits. But 4 Bits.\n\nDooley published the following letter in BYTE magazine:\n\n> \u201cI would like to get the following on record: The word byte was coined\n> around 1956 to 1957 at MIT Lincoln Laboratories within a project called SAGE\n> (the North American Air Defense System), which was jointly developed by\n> Rand, Lincoln Labs, and IBM. In that era, computer memory structure was\n> already defined in terms of word size. A word consisted of x number of bits;\n> a bit represented a binary notational position in a word. Operations\n> typically operated on all the bits in the full word.\n>\n> We coined the word byte to refer to a logical set of bits less than a full\n> word size. At that time, it was not defined specifically as x bits but\n> typically referred to as a set of 4 bits, as that was the size of most of\n> our coded data items. Shortly afterward, I went on to other responsibilities\n> that removed me from SAGE. After having spent many years in Asia, I returned\n> to the U.S. and was bemused to find out that the word byte was being used in\n> the new microcomputer technology to refer to the basic addressable memory\n> unit.\n>\n> Louis G. Dooley Ocala, FL\u201d\n\n### So... what the heck is a \u201cByte\u201d?!\n\nThat\u2019s right. We now have two very, very different definitions for the word\n\u201cByte\u201d. Both creations of the word happened independently... and at almost the\nexact same moment in time.\n\n  * \u201cThe Buchholz Byte\u201d - A grouping of 6 Bits.\n  * \u201cThe Dooley Byte\u201d - A grouping of an undefined number of bits, less than a full word size. Often used to describe 4 Bits.\n\nYou\u2019ll note that neither of these definitions \u2014 from the men who created the\nterm \u2014 have the number \u201c8\u201d in them.\n\nThe shift towards 8 Bits per Byte started to happen in the 1970s... with the\ndevelopment and gaining popularity of 8-Bit processors, such as the legendary\nIntel 8008.\n\nA revision of the Intel 8008 CPU\n\nInterestingly, some of those early 8-Bit CPU\u2019s had specific functions for\nhandling 4-Bit chunks of data. Because, up until that point, 4 and 6-Bit\n\u201cBytes\u201d were incredibly common (including in the predecessor to the Intel\n8008... the 4-Bit Intel 4004).\n\nFun Factoid: Nowadays a 4-Bit group is called a \u201cNibble\u201d. Which is adorable.\n\nFor quite some time the term \u201coctet\u201d or \u201coctad\u201d was used to denote 8 Bit\ngroups. At some point along the way, most people phased that out as well...\nsimply referring to all \u201cgroups of bits\u201d as a \u201cByte\u201d. Though you will still\nfind \u201coctet\u201d used here and there, especially when talking about various\nnetwork protocols.\n\nAll of which means...\n\n### Dooley invented the modern \u201cByte\u201d... not Buchholz\n\nWhile many writers, enthusiasts, and computer historians are quick to say that\nWerner Buchholz coined the term \u201cByte\u201d... they are obviously mistaken.\n\nBesides the fact that it\u2019s hard to discern who (Dooley or Buchholz) actually\nused the term first... the Buchholz definition is no longer used at all in\nmodern computing.\n\nThe Buchholz definition is specific. 6 Bits. Which modern computing has\ndetermined is not the amount of Bits in a modern Byte.\n\nThe Dooley definition, on the other hand, allows for wiggle room. Which means\nthat an 8 Bit \u201cByte\u201d would fit the Dooley definition. But not the Buchholz.\n\nThe facts are clear: Louis G. Dooley created the word \u201cByte\u201d. At least as it\nhas been used for the last 40+ years.\n\nBut Buchholz \u2014 an absolute legend in the computing world \u2014 gets one heck of an\nHonorable Mention trophy.\n\nRead full Article\n\n22\n\nView All\n\n18\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nMay 05, 2024\n\nThe History of Ctrl-Alt-Delete\n\nHow the \"Three Fingered Salute\" came to be.\n\nCtrl-Alt-Del \u2014 sometimes known as \u201cThe Three Fingered Salute\u201d \u2014 is among the\nmost recognizable keyboard commands in the entire computer world.

How, exactly, did it come to be?\n\nLet\u2019s take a tour through the history of this beloved / hated / mocked key\ncombination.\n\n### Not the first multi-key reset\n\nControl-Alt-Delete may be the most famous \u201creset this computer\u201d key\ncombination... but it wasn\u2019t the first.\n\nThat honor goes to the Exidy Sorcerer in 1978. A Z-80 powered home computer\nthat never saw the commercial success of its rivals.\n\nThe Exidy Sorcerer\n\nNote the two \u201cReset\u201d keys in the top right of the keyboard.\n\nOk, that simply is too small to make out.\n\nENHANCE!\n\nRESET! RESET!\n\nMuch better.\n\nHere we see the two \u201cReset\u201d keys.\n\nHow do you hard reset an Exidy Sorcerer? You guessed it -- press both of these\nkeys at the same time.\n\nIn theory this was to make it harder to accidentally reset a machine... having\na single \"Reset\" key would simply be too easy to tap without intending to. But\nthey put the two keys immediately next to each other. And right next to\n\"RETURN\" -- which you would always be reaching for with a pinky. Strange\nkeyboard layout choice, right?\n\nIt's like putting a \"Nuclear Self Destruct\" button right next to the \"Make a\nCup of Coffee\" button.\n\nRegardless, the Sorcerer still wins the title of \u201cfirst computer with a multi-\nkey reset\u201d. So it\u2019s got that going for it.\n\n### The IBM 5150\n\nFlash forward to 1981, in Boca Raton, Florida. A team of engineers was about\nto release the IBM 5150 (aka \u201cThe IBM Personal Computer\u201d).\n\n(Yes. The IBM PC was crated in Florida. That random little tidbit doesn\u2019t get\ntalked about much.)\n\nThe IBM 5150 Personal Computer\n\nOne of the engineers working on the BIOS of the 5150, David Bradley,\nimplemented a three-key reset for the team within IBM (and partners such as\nMicrosoft) to use during development.\n\nA convenience feature that was never intended to see the light of day. Three\nkeys that would quickly reset the entire machine without needing to do a hard\n\u201cPower off and Power back on\u201d.\n\nThat three-key combination?\n\nControl... Alt... Escape.\n\n\u201cSorry, Lunduke. You wrote that wrong. It\u2019s Control-Alt-Delete. Not Escape.\u201d\n\nNot at first. In those early days, the key combination was \u201cCtrl-Alt-Esc\u201d.\nThat\u2019s how the IBM 5150 was originally reset.\n\nThat, right there, is a good looking keyboard.\n\nHowever, all three of those keys being on the left hand side of the keyboard\nmade it too easy to accidentally bump. You might as well have two \"RESET\" keys\nright next to each other (how crazy would that be?).\n\nSo the lead programmer of the project, Mel Hallerman, suggested changing\n\u201cEscape\u201d to \u201cDelete\u201d (which was on the complete other side of the keyboard).\nThus making it much harder to accidentally hit.\n\nAnd, just like that, Control-Alt-Delete was born.\n\n### It was not supposed to ship\n\nConsidering how instantly recognizable the \"Three Fingered Salute\" is\nnowadays, it seems wild to think that it was never intended for the public to\neven know about -- it was strictly for internal development purposes.\n\nIn fact, it barely received any development time at all according to the man\nwho developed it.\n\n> \u201cIt was five minutes, 10 minutes of activity, and then I moved on to the\n> next of the 100 things that needed to get done.\u201d - David Bradley\n\nDavid Bradley, the father of Ctrl-Alt-Del. Photo credit: AP\n\nAll that changed when someone included the details of \u201cCtrl-Alt-Del\u201d in the\ntechnical manuals for the IBM Personal Computer.\n\nHere you can see it documented in the \u201cIBM 5150 Guide to Operations\u201d (where it\nis detailed not once... but three times):\n\nSource: IBM 5150 Guide\n\nAt which point... the cat was out of the bag. Ctrl-Alt-Delete was documented\nand publicly known (and used) by a commercially successful computer.\n\nThere was no turning back now. It was a standard. Even if it was never\nintended to see the light of day.\n\nAnd, to think, we were this close to having Ctrl-Alt-Escape instead. (Let\u2019s\njust thank heavens we didn\u2019t get stuck with the double RESET keys...)\n\nRead full Article\n\n18\n\nView All\n\n3\n\nReply\n\nSee More\n\nSign Up To Lunduke\n\nSign Up for free to see more from this community or subscribe to Lunduke for\n$6/month to support Lunduke for more interaction and exclusive content.\n\nLogin Signup\n\nAvailable on mobile and TV devices\n\nPowered by Locals\n\nAbout Community\n\nLunduke\n\n6304 Members\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nSeptember 22, 2023\n\nLunduke Journal Link Central (tm)\n\nLooking for some of the biggest articles and shows from The Lunduke Journal?\nOr Podcast feeds?
