It\u2019s like having a\nsenior engineer in front of you.\n\n### Sebastian Gallese\n\nSenior Engineer, Included Health\n\nPretty darn impressed with\n\nGreptile so far. Loaded up a Github repo, and asked questions about a repo,\nreceived quick, intelligent answers in plain English. It was even able to\ncreate a Mermaid diagram to help me visualize the code.\n\n### Paul Suarez\n\nSenior Software Engineer, Liberty Mutual\n\nI am extremely impressed and honestly quite surprised. I have GPT4, the new\nGemini Advanced, and Greptile in 3 different tabs (I'm also using Copilot both\nin Bing and GitHub Copilot chat in vsCode, but they're pretty terrible). I'm\nwriting my prompt and pasting it into all 3 AIs. ALL but ONE time, Greptile\nhas given me BY FAR the best responses. The code is often complete without me\nbegging. The context is far better since it has access to my repo. The\nadditional supporting articles and resources offered along the response were\nreally helpful.\n\n### Jack Chapman\n\nCardinal Gray, ex-Citadel\n\nThe team is kick ass. If you use GPT while writing code, you should try\nGreptile. It's much more tailored to that use case than regular GPT. I've used\nthe product to write tests and to debug how our code interacts with other\nrepos.\n\n### Anikonda\n\n@anikonda\n\nThis tool is absolutely amazing. Been absolutely loving it! Saving so much\ntime for building out my side project as the project becomes bigger and bigger\n\n### KineticDrive\n\nAI at Georgia Tech\n\nJust wanted to say y\u2019all are killing it. Currently using your service for help\nwith a codebase for my masters thesis here at Georgia Tech and couldn\u2019t help\nbut recommend to lab mates\n\n### Rahul Behal\n\nCTO, AgentHub, ex-Amazon\n\nGreptile is 100x better than ChatGPT and 10x better than Cursor at answering\nquestions about the entire codebase.\n\nI have no idea how they do it.\n\n# Goodbye, docs \ud83d\udc4b\n\n## Greptile can answer hard questions on complex codebases better than any\nother tool. Where we're going, we don't need docs.\n\n### Onboard Developers\n\nRamp up new engineers to your codebase 10x faster!\n\n### Debug 10X Faster\n\nPaste-in an error message and let Greptile diagnose it!\n\n### Replace your docs\n\nDevelopers don't like writing docs. Now, they don't have to!\n\n### Crush Tech Debt\n\nParse legacy code with ease, so you can focus on shipping.\n\n# 24/7 Subject-matter expert.\n\n## Greptile answers questions like that one 100X dev on your team who's been\naround for years and knows the codebase cold.\n\n\u00a9 Tabnam Inc. 2024\n\nLinkedIn\n\nContact Us\n\n", "frontpage": true}
