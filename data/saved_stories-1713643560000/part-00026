Nothing so serious that\nI was truly concerned (at first) but, annoyances, to be sure. (\"PC? Weren't\nyou talking about a TV??\" you might be thinking to yourself. Yes. I'll get\nthere. Oh, will I ever get there.)\n\nFor a long time, the most serious hiccup with my PC was being unable to open\nDisplay Settings on my PC. I had to use Nvidia control panel to make\nadjustments. Whatever. Didn't affect my ability to work or anything. I had\njust updated to Windows 11 so I thought maybe something went wrong in the\nupdate. So I did another install (which meant I had to re-install a ton of\nmusic plugin stuff on my computer which takes ages given all the stuff I use.)\n\nThe fresh install still didn't fix it. So I simply ignored it for the better\npart of 2 years.\n\nOver time, so slowly I didn't really clock them as being related, other things\nstarted to fail.\n\nI have a Komplete Kontrol S88 midi Keyboard that interfaces with Kontakt and\nKomplete Kontrol in my DAW. I can use the keyboard to adjust settings or\nselect instruments without having to look at my computer screen. At some point\nlast year this stopped working. I could still use it to input midi, and I was\nafraid I'd have to do a fresh install of all the Native Instruments stuff I\nuse, so I kept putting off trying to fix it until I had less going on with\nwork. It worked, just not as well as it should!\n\nThen, Task manager started to hang in weird ways. It wouldn't close unless I\nforced it closed with ProcExp. Whatever! Computers are weird!\n\nI had trouble getting video capture cards to connect when I considered\nstreaming Splatoon. Whatever! I'm not a streamer, I should probably use that\nenergy on something else.\n\nBut then, in March, I had some things fail that, turns out, are pretty\nnecessary to using the computer.\n\nI was trying to get remote desktop to work on my tablet so I could work in the\nliving room closer to my cat, Grendel, who was still very much in mourning for\nhis best friend (<3 Guts). Grendel is at his happiest when he's napping on the\ncouch next to a human. So I thought, hey, I could do some stuff in remote\ndesktop mode! It wasn't something I used very often because it doesn't play\nsuper nice with audio, it'd been probably over a year since I last used it,\nbut I knew it had worked and had been easy to set up.\n\nWell. It refused to connect despite appearing as an option on my tablet. And\nas I was trying to troubleshoot this problem...\n\nMy task bars on my PC disappeared! If I moused over the spot they should have\nbeen I got the loading circle. And my monitors would jitter!\n\nSystem settings were nowhere to be found. To navigate I had to open Task\nManager (which if you recall was already acting strange and sluggish for the\npast year) in order to open the command panel, which I'd then use to launch\nprograms. Or, attempt to. If I tried to open the system settings, my PC spat\nout \"Uhhh what's \"Settings\"? We ain't got settings\" (in command I got\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32>start ms-settings: Access is denied.\" despite being in\nadmin mode)\n\nSO I started to panic a wee bit. It's not a great time for me to possibly need\na new PC! Plus, it works great when it works.\n\nI manually backed up everything important from my main PC drive (as I could\nnot access the windows backup program because it lived in settings!!!!!!!!)\nand downloaded the Windows 11 installer to a drive in case I needed to\ncompletely wipe my computer and start fresh.\n\nIn a last ditch effort, I tried updating my Nvidia GeForce graphics driver and\nrestarted.\n\nLo and behold, my taskbars came back and I could access settings again!\nHuzzah!\n\nThis lasted for 6 days. And then the taskbars disappeared AGAIN along with\nSettings.\n\nAt least by now I'd become somewhat comfortable using command to get around,\nso I was less panicked than I was in round 1. I at least knew the computer\nwouldn't crash and delete all my shit suddenly (plus I had my backups that\nwere up-to-date).\n\nI asked my friends if they'd ever heard of anything like this, and Cohost's\nown @vogon helped me poke around some additional graphics driver stuff in case\nupdating to the new Nvidia program that's in beta would solve my issue. This\nfelt super promising when I went into safe mode and saw taskbars. So, I did\nthe update, and, as before, when I updated, the taskbars came back! But there\nwere gone again almost immediately. My screen literally started flickering and\nthey vanished. It was so fucking bizarre.\n\nI turned to google once more, hoping that somehow, as useless as google is\nthese days, maybe I'd find what I needed to fix my damn computer!\n\nSomehow, against all odds, I found it. I happened to use the exact right\nstring in my search to pull up some reddit threads. The first one didn't have\nanything useful, but a few results down I spotted \"no taskbar and task manager\nfreezes\" holy moly!!!\n\nAt first glance however, there wasn't anything useful. But then I spotted some\ncollapsed comments at the bottom of the thread. I knew more than likely they\njust had comments like \"sucks bro\" or \"this is why i use linux :/\" But I\nexpanded them and inside was a link to a Microsoft forum post. I kept my\nexpectations in check and clicked on the link. What I saw had my nearly\nvibrating in my seat.\n\nThis was the solution.\n\nNarayan B Nov 16, 2023, 12:20 AM\n\nSo I finally solved it!\n\nSource of the problem: an Android TV (HiSense model) connected to my network.\nYes. A TV caused this issue.\n\nHISENSE? LIKE THE SAME BRAND OF TV I HAVE HAD SINCE 2020???\n\nI followed the instructions. I deleted keys generated by our TV for 5 straight\nminutes. 5 Minutes of like 200BPM clicking. I restarted. Everything worked\nagain. I laughed so hard I cried. I felt like I'd solved a murder. The main\nsuspect was the PC but the culprit was the TV in the other room. And he almost\ngot away with it!!! If I had spent a few days carrying out a clean install and\nre-installing all my work stuff, my problem would have come back. If I had\ntaken the PC out back and shot it and replaced it with a fancy new computer,\nthe problem would have come back.\n\nBecause the problem was never the PC. The Problem was my Hisense TV in the\nnext room.\n\nOnce I carried this out, I was able to open display settings for the first\ntime (outside of safe mode) in 2 years. When I deleted the keys, my Task\nManager started behaving normally again. I turned around and saw that my\nkeyboard was once again displaying the VST controls on its screen. The fancy\nmidi keyboard was back at full functionality. I was able to connect my CRT as\na display again using the HDMI -> RCA converters I'd assumed had stopped\nworking (nope! they still worked, they always worked!)\n\nWhich brings me to today. Almost a month later everything still works. So, I\ndecided to see if remote desktop would magically work again. The answer is:\nYes. Yes, in fact, my TV was the reason my remote desktop connection had\nfailed the month before.\n\nSo here I am, sitting on my couch with my tablet and bluetooth keeb and mouse,\nwriting this post in remote desktop mode so I could attach screenshots of this\nsaga to my post without sitting at my PC. Grendel is snoring beside me as I\nwrite.\n\nAs a treat for reading this far, please enjoy two screenshots of my friends\nreacting to the solution of my great mystery.\n\nadding: the TV in question, in case you're curious: Hisense 50Q8G- 50\" Smart\n4K ULEDTM Android TV with Quantum Dot Technology (Canada Model)\n\n#curse#cursed#tv#hisense#HiSense TV Curse#mysteries#Solved\nMystery#troubleshooting#technology#pc#windows#windows 11#windows\n10#taskbar#task manager#computer troubles#my computer is sick#cursed\ntech#reddit#google search#remote desktop#Midi#interface#Ableton#native\ninstruments#komplete kontrol s88\n\n65 comments\n\nYou must log in to comment.\n\n#### in reply to @ghoulnoise's post:\n\ntech witch lun\u00e9@lunemercove19 hr. ago\n\nincredibly cursed! glad you got it resolved\n\nlogin to reply\n\n@damon19 hr. ago\n\nsmart TVs are absolute hell bastard machines\n\nlogin to reply\n\npriscilla@ghoulnoise19 hr. ago\n\nI'm campaigning to make TVs so dumb they devolve back into the far superior\nCRT\n\nlogin to reply\n\nPleasingFungus@cavalcadeofcats18 hr. ago\n\nhell ya preach it\n\nlogin to reply\n\nEric Edmondson@erice14 hr. ago\n\nplease do, we need a savior\n\nlogin to reply\n\n@effef13 hr. ago\n\npretty much the worst things ever invented\n\nlogin to reply\n\n@frenemymine18 hr. ago\n\nhahaha what the FUCK\n\nlogin to reply\n\njosh g.@joshg18 hr. ago\n\nwhat the fuck\n\nlogin to reply\n\nlydia@lydia18 hr. ago\n\ncomputers were a mistake holy shit\n\nlogin to reply\n\nSpencer@SPNKr18 hr. ago\n\nI have a Hisense in the other room and I'm now looking at it like it's an\nenemy agent.\n\nlogin to reply\n\nRatel, honey.@akhra17 hr. ago\n\nwhat's truly incredible is, this is the second reason for me, and frankly I\nwouldn't be surprised if they happened at the same time. a software update\nlast year came with a new license where they invented something even worse\nthan an arbitration clause (you have to contact their lawyers first, and they\nhave to approve arbitration; and this explicitly applies to class action) and\nthe notification had only an \"accept\" button and there was also an explicit\n\"circumventing the dialog and using the software counts as acceptance\" bit. so\nmy Hisense got an immediate factory reset and lives offline, running software\nprior to that license... which is probably the only reason I never saw these\nissues.\n\nlogin to reply\n\nliffy \ud83d\udc9c@lifning5 hr. ago\n\nwhat's really insidious about this is like.. yeah, i think probably most\nhisense TV owners are just having their windows computers mysteriously start\nbreaking like OP, and perhaps some of them have wasted money on trying to\nrepair or replace their PCs as a result, or at least lost the ability to do\nsomething important for their work etc. -- heck, this sounds a lot like an FCC\nPart 15 violation when it comes to emitting signals that cause harmful\ninterference with other devices -- but good luck getting a class action suit\ngoing about it in the binding-arbitration world!\n\nlogin to reply\n\nDamien@eramdam17 hr. ago\n\noh my fucking god\n\nlogin to reply\n\nsamson@squidcrusher17 hr. ago\n\nWow this is wild!

The system should probably limit the number of UPnP devices that can\nbe registered at the same time.\n\nFunnily, I got a similar \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d issue, but it was\nalmost the reverse situation: I couldn't watch TV if a specific computer on my\nnetwork was turned off.\n\nThis was a fun combination of factors:\n\n  * My ISP\u2019s TV box receives TV via multicast UDP, so when I\u2019m watching TV, multicast packets go from the router to the TV box\n  * I have a dumb Ethernet switch between them, which replicates the incoming multicast packets on all of its ports. Since other connected devices just ignore multicast packets they are not interested in, this is fine, but...\n  * At this time I had one computer on the switch whose Ethernet card stayed up but switched to 10 Mbps when the computer was turned off. No idea why.\n\nSo when the computer is off and the TV box is on, the switch dutifully\nretransmits the multicast packets on the 10 Mbps port. Since 10 Mbps is not\nsufficient for that, its send queues fill up, until it starts dropping random\npackets on all connections. Fun.\n\nlogin to reply\n\npriscilla@ghoulnoise15 hr. ago\n\nI love technology\n\nlogin to reply\n\nternarykitten@ternarykitten14 hr. ago\n\n10 Mbps may be to receive Wake on LAN packets.\n\nlogin to reply\n\nAnnie D@ann-arcana13 hr. ago\n\nMy worst \"spooky action\" story has to be the ISP-provided wifi router that\nindirectly killed my iBook G4.\n\nFor some reason, whenever the iBook connected to the wifi, the system would\nlock up after about 20 minutes, and after a reboot, lock up progressively\nfaster until it was unusable.\n\nI figured it was a dying HDD, but I tried multiple drives and none of them\nfixed the problem. Finally in the process of the insane disassembly\nprocess[1], I snapped the tiny power connector off the mainboard and that was\nthe end of it. :(\n\nReplaced it with a PowerBook G4 I found locally, booted up fine when the\nseller tested it in front of me, brought it to the office, worked fine there\n... got it home and it locked up again.\n\nTurns out for whatever reason I never figured out, my specific Zyxel\nmodem/router combo will cause the wifi in old PowerMacs to hard crash the\ncomputer. I fixed it by scoring an old Airport Express and sticking it in a\nDMZ. Eventually the Zyxel died and I replaced it, and the TP-Link I bought\nworked just fine.\n\n[1] It's so insane that the iFixit guide pauses on step 11 to say:\n\n> Breathe deeply. Trying times are ahead, but we promise the lower case does\n> come off.\n\nlogin to reply\n\nFrancis Theodore Catte@franktcatte13 hr. ago\n\nIt is truly insane how deeply Apple buried a notoriously unreliable\nmodel&brand hard drive in the G4 iBooks.

Pause frames should tell the switch\nto stop sending any traffic for some amount of time, but broken switches will\nrelay pause frames to other devices on the network, which will then stop\nsending traffic, effectively killing the whole network.\n\nlogin to reply\n\nAnnie D@ann-arcana15 hr. ago\n\nThis is why my TV is a cheap RCA-branded panel I found on Amazon with zero\nsmart features whatsoever...
