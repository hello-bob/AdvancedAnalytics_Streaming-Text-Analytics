Not all Google employees are happy\nabout that.\n\nAlexander Koerner/Getty Images\n\nThe first time Zelda Montes heard about Google's Project Nimbus was about six\nmonths ago, even though she worked at the company since 2022. The project is a\n$1.2 billion contract to supply Israel with cloud computing services.\n\nAs someone who's opposed to the war in Gaza, Montes says she was shocked. This\ncomes at a time when tension over the Israeli conflict is simmering across the\ncountry.\n\n\"I think that speaks volumes to just how little people at work actually know\nabout this contract,\" Montes says, who worked as a software engineer at\nYouTube, which is owned by Google.\n\nMontes immediately joined a Google employee group called No Tech for\nApartheid, which had been organizing around Project Nimbus since 2021. Their\ngoal is for Google to drop its contract with the Israeli government. She says\nthe group has raised its concerns with Google's leadership, spoke in company\ntown halls and set up tables in Google's offices with fliers about Project\nNimbus.\n\n### Technology\n\n### Google blocks California news in response to bill that would force tech\ngiant to pay\n\n### Business\n\n### Google Employees Walk Out To Protest Company's Treatment Of Women\n\nBut, she says, \"Google was quite literally silencing our voices in the\nworkplace and not allowing for any kind of worker dissent to be expressed\naround the project.\"\n\nSo, on Tuesday, the group went one step further.\n\nThey staged sit-in protests in Google's offices in Silicon Valley, New York\nCity and Seattle \u2013 more than 100 protestors showed up. A day later, Google\nfired Montes and 27 other employees who are part of the No Tech for Apartheid\ngroup.\n\nThis is one of the largest mass firings seen in the tech industry and comes as\nmany Silicon Valley companies do work with Israel. Some employees say they\naren't comfortable with that.\n\nWorkers at Amazon and Facebook parent Meta have also clashed with their\nemployers over speaking out against the war. Last month Google fired another\nsoftware engineer who protested at an Israel tech event.\n\nA Google spokesperson told NPR in an email when asked about Tuesday's\nprotestors, \"physically impeding other employees' work and preventing them\nfrom accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and\ncompletely unacceptable behavior. After refusing multiple requests to leave\nthe premises, law enforcement was engaged to remove them to ensure office\nsafety.\"\n\n### Project Nimbus and cloud computing\n\nGoogle, in partnership with Amazon, started contracting with the Israeli\ngovernment on Project Nimbus in 2021. Last week, Time magazine obtained an\ninternal company document that showed Israel's Ministry of Defense has\ncontracted with Google as recently as last month.\n\nThe Google spokesperson said its cloud services support several governments\naround the world, including Israel. Project Nimbus is for government\nministries, the spokesperson said, and \"this work is not directed at highly\nsensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or\nintelligence services.\"\n\nThe No Tech for Apartheid group says that without clarity on the project, it's\nstill unclear how the technology is being used in Israel. They say they fear\nit could be used in the war in Gaza and be weaponized against Palestinian\ncivilians.\n\n\"Workers have the right to know how their labor is being used, and to have a\nsay in ensuring the technology they build is not used for harm,\" the group\nsaid in a statement.\n\n### Worker arrests and firings\n\nAround noon on the day of the sit-in, Montes says she and other protestors at\nGoogle's New York office unfurled a 15-foot banner down an open staircase that\nread: \"No tech for genocide.\" (Israel rejects claims of genocide, saying it's\nfighting in self-defense).\n\nThey sat around and played the card game Uno until they were approached by\nGoogle security. Montes says they were then told to leave or else they'd be\narrested, but it wasn't until about eight hours later that the police arrived.\n\n\"It was a lot of weird energy because we kept thinking like, 'are they going\nto call the cops already?'\" Montes says, recounting the day.\n\nBy the time the police showed up it was nighttime and most everyone was gone\nfrom the office. They handcuffed four protesters who refused to leave the\nbuilding, including Montes, walked them to a freight elevator and down into\nthe garage where a police van was waiting. The group spent about three and a\nhalf hours in jail.\n\n### Technology\n\n### Google Illegally Fired And Spied On Workers Who Tried To Organize, Labor\nAgency Says\n\n### Technology\n\n### Tech workers recount the cost of speaking out, as tensions rise inside\ncompanies\n\nIn all, nine protestors were arrested in California and New York. It wasn't\nuntil the following evening that Google began to fire workers. Montes says she\nwas placed on administrative leave at first, but then got an email saying she\nwas terminated.\n\nThe email said she had \"violated Google's code of conduct\" and \"policy on\nharassment, discrimination and retaliation\" during the events on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral of the Google employees who were fired didn't participate in the\nprotests this week, according to No Tech for Apartheid. Google's spokesperson\nsaid the company has been investigating employees on an individual basis.\n\n\"We have so far concluded individual investigations that resulted in the\ntermination of employment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate\nand take action as needed,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMontes says the firings are a fear tactic that won't work. \"Workers are\nagitated and we're organized,\" she says, and even though she's been fired\n\"we'll keep organizing until this project is dropped.\"\n\nEditor's note: Google and Amazon are among NPR's financial supporters.\n\n  * Project Nimbus\n  * Hamas-Israel war\n  * cloud computing\n  * Google\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n", "frontpage": true}
