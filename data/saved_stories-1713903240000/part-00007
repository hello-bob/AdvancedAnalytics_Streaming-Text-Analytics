When I was doing sales calls with companies\nabout Parthenon part of the risk factor was what if I decided this project\nwasn't viable as a business. Every time, I said I would open source the code\nand continue to work on it. Well, I decided a year ago that I needed to change\nmy approach and focus on a single area instead of trying to solve lots of\nproblems as Parthenon does. So I created BillaBear, which uses Parthenon, to\nfocus on billing. Which is actually building the billing system I wanted in\nParthenon.\n\n## Why two different licenses?\n\nThe main Parthenon bundle/library is available under GPL to ensure the freedom\nof others to use and share their modifications. The skeleton application is\nunder MIT to allow people to do what I did with BillaBear and create a\nshareable application using Parthenon that they're able to license\ndifferently. Since Parthenon doesn't continue business logic it shouldn't\naffect anyone who is trying to create a business application since GPL doesn't\n(as far as I know) infect their code. However, if they were to use the\nskeleton application I believe it would infect their code and that would\ncreate a business risk for companies.\n\nTL;DR - I want to allow people to relicense what they do with the skeleton\napplication but not be able to do so with the core library.\n\n## Why isn't Parthenon viable?\n\nOne of the main problems with Parthenon and the marketplace is it isn't really\nwhat people want. It's positioned as a SaaS boilerplate, simply because that's\nwhat people understood and it does all of that. But it does a whole bunch of\nother things that are so out of scope for a Boilerplate. And that's simply\nbecause it was never meant to be a boilerplate. I had envisioned it as a\n\"product framework\" of sorts. No other boilerplate for example has A/B\ntesting,\n\nAnother issue is the tech stack. If you look at who uses Symfony it's\ngenerally in-house development teams working on big long projects. If you look\nat what the cool kids use to build quick rapid projects it's generally in\nJavaScript or a similar stack. Even within the PHP space, Laravel is chosen by\nagencies and small developers to quickly build something due to how it\nsimplifies the creation process while Symfony is about making it easier to\nmaintain.\n\n## What's happening to Parthenon?\n\nThis isn't that Parthenon is no longer maintained. I'll be using Parthenon\nheavily for BillaBear and any re-usable features/components I create that I\nneed for BillaBear features will be in Parthenon. So there are no plans to\nstop work on Parthenon it's just not been my focus for a while and almost\ncertainly won't be for a while. I'm sure it will be my focus again one day.\n\nYou can find it at github.com/getparthenon\n\n## BillaBear\n\nA small little plug for BillaBear. It's a Subscription Management and Billing\nSystem that is self-hostable. It's released under the FSL license that Sentry\nuses and basically just restricts creating a competing cloud billing service.\nIt's self-hostable and I'm currently working on the SaaS version.\n\nWebsite: BillaBear.com Github: github.com/billabear/billabear\n\n## SaaS Start Up Guide\n\nAnother little plug, a fortnightly newsletter that is written by experts in\nFinance, Law, and Tech that focuses on starting a SaaS company.
