It ships with many\nnew features and improvements \u2014 over one hundred improvements in total!\n\nThis new version of Kong Insomnia also makes it much easier to migrate from\nother products with a more reliable \u201cimport\u201d experience, while improving the\nspeed of using the product and making it more customizable. Let\u2019s dive into\nall the notable features.\n\n## Pre-request scripting\n\nInsomnia 9.0 ships with the much anticipated pre-request scripting capability,\nallowing you to write a custom script in JavaScript before testing a request\nin a collection.\n\nThe pre-request scripting capability allows you to be in full control of a\nrequest lifecycle by programmatically building more complex behavior. This\nincludes the ability to make other HTTP requests to retrieve an authentication\ntoken from a third party before submitting the original request, or\norchestrating multiple requests together. It also allows users to modify the\ncurrent requests programmatically in a variety of ways by accessing parameters\nand environment variables directly.\n\nInsomnia\u2019s pre-request scripts are compatible with Postman. This means that,\nin most scenarios, you\u2019ll be able to copy-paste your existing pre-request\nscripts from Postman into Insomnia, and they'll work seamlessly.\n\n## Improved offline access\n\nIn this new 9.0 release, we\u2019ve significantly improved the offline usage of\nInsomnia for those users who are working in restricted environments or have an\nunreliable internet connection:\n\n  * Users are not required to log in every time the application starts. Instead, we\u2019ll remember the user session for 30 days in the desktop application and avoid requesting they log in again during that time frame.\n  * We\u2019ve also improved the experience when starting the application while being offline, by removing an application error that used to pop up when starting the application.\n\nWe've resolved an issue when starting Insomnia while offline.\n\nOf course, the Scratch Pad is available for usage offline as well and without\nan account, and whether you decide to log in to your account or not, the data\ncan be still stored fully locally based on your project settings. Data can be\nstored in the following backends on a per-project basis:\n\n  * In the cloud via Cloud Sync for ease of collaboration and fully encrypted\n  * Fully locally via Local Vault to keep data entirely local even after logging in\n  * On a third-party Git repository via Git Sync that doesn\u2019t require cloud access\n\ni\ufe0f Your data can be local even after logging in to Insomnia.\n\nWith Insomnia, you\u2019re in full control of where your data \u2014 like collections\nand test and design documents \u2014 are stored.\n\nAdditionally, Insomnia organization owners can also fully mandate top-down\nstorage backends for all an organization\u2019s projects using Storage Control. By\ndoing so, the collaborators of an organization are forced to store their data\nin the desired storage type.\n\n## API mocking\n\nInsomnia's capabilities just got better with the release of our built-in API\nmocking feature that can be used in the cloud or locally. This means that you\ncan now use Insomnia to:\n\n  1. Design APIs\n  2. Debug APIs\n  3. Test APIs\n  4. Mock APIs\n  5. Implement CI/CD automation with the Insomnia CLI to run tests and linting for QA.\n\nWith API mocking, teams can reduce the coordination required between the\nbackend and frontend by creating API mock routes with a predefined response\nand status code \u2014 on a custom route that we can configure \u2014 so that you can\nstart building on top of an agreed-upon API interface even before the\nunderlying API implementation is complete.\n\nAPI mocks can be seamlessly hosted in the cloud by Insomnia for ease of\nsharing and collaboration, or they can run on a self-hosted mock server\nlocally for full control.\n\n## Global search\n\nWhen working across several different projects and organizations, it can be\nchallenging to search for what you're looking for. To make it easier to find\nyour collections, tests, design specs (and now API mocks too) we have\nintroduced a new global search function that will search for your files across\nevery Insomnia organization.\n\nThis capability will improve your productivity and make it even easier to\nimmediately find what you're looking for.\n\n## Improved collaboration and more\n\nWhen collaborating with either Cloud Sync or Git Sync, you can now better\nvisualize what changes are being committed and pushed using the new in-app\ndiff viewer.\n\nAlso, we're now automatically pulling files like collections, documents,\nmocks, and tests in the dashboard without the need to manually pull them\nyourself. These files will show as \u201cUnsynced\u201d and will be fully downloaded\nsimply by clicking on them.\n\nYou can now also hide the \u201cOrganizations\u201d sidebar by using the new toggle in\nthe footer of Insomnia, and show it again by pressing the button again. This\nallows you to have more screen space to debug your collections.\n\n## The future of Insomnia\n\nWe have doubled down on the shipping velocity of Insomnia, and in the\nfollowing months, you will see even more capabilities like:\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Post-request scripting (shipping very soon)\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Multiple tabs\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Folder-level authentication and settings\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Git Sync on a per-project basis\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Global environment variables\n\n\ud83d\udd2e A new YAML format for collaborating better in Insomnia\n\n\ud83d\udd2e A more advanced RBAC for collaboration\n\n\ud83d\udd2e A revamped plugin ecosystem\n\n\ud83d\udd2e And more!\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the changes made last year to drive\nthe product to a path of sustainable development and growth, and we're driving\nthe roadmap based on the feedback received on GitHub issues and discussions.\nSo please send your feedback and suggestions, since there's a high likelihood\nthat they will be built for the upcoming releases.\n\nGet started for free with Kong Insomnia 9.0 today.\n\nTags:Insomnia\n\nPowering the API world\n\nIncrease developer productivity, security, and performance at scale with the\nunified platform for API management, service mesh, and ingress controller.\n\nSign up for Kong newsletter\n\nProducts\n\nKong KonnectKong Gateway EnterpriseKong GatewayKong MeshKong Ingress\nControllerKong InsomniaProduct UpdatesGet Started\n\nExplore More\n\nAPI First DevelopmentAPI Gateway: Build vs BuyAWS and Kong TogetherKong vs\nMulesoftKong vs ApigeeAccelerate APIOpsCloud API Modernization\n\nDocumentation\n\nKong Konnect DocsKong Gateway DocsKong Gateway Enterprise DocsKong Mesh\nDocsKong Insomnia DocsKong Konnect Plugin Hub\n\nOpen Source\n\nKong GatewayKumaInsomniaKong Community\n\nCompany\n\nAbout KongCustomersCareersPressEventsContact\n\n  * Terms\u2022\n  * Privacy\u2022\n  * Trust and Compliance\n\n  * \u00a9 Kong Inc. 2024\n\nBy clicking \u201cAccept All Cookies\u201d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your\ndevice to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our\nmarketing efforts.\n\n## Privacy Preference Center\n\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your\nbrowser, mostly in the form of cookies.
