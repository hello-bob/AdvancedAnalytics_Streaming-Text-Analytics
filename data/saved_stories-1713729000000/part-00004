She arrived to a small apartment in Silver\nLake, one block from the Vista Theatre\u2014a single-screen Spanish Colonial\nRevival building that had opened in 1923, four years before the advent of\nsound in film.\n\nSmith was looking for a job in television. She had an MFA from the Yale School\nof Drama, and had lived and worked as a playwright in New York City for\nyears\u2014two of her productions garnered positive reviews in the Times. But\nplaywriting had begun to feel like a vanity project: to pay rent, she\u2019d worked\nas a nanny, a transcriptionist, an administrative assistant, and more. There\nseemed to be no viable financial future in theater, nor in academia, the other\nworld where she supposed she could make inroads.\n\nFor several years, her friends and colleagues had been absconding for Los\nAngeles, and were finding success. This was the second decade of prestige\ntelevision: the era of Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Homeland, Girls. TV had become a\nplace for sharp wit, singular voices, people with vision\u2014and they were getting\npaid. It took a year and a half, but Smith eventually landed a spot as a staff\nwriter on HBO\u2019s The Newsroom, and then as a story editor on Showtime\u2019s The\nAffair in 2015.\n\nI first spoke with Smith in August of last year, four months into the strike\ncalled by the Writers Guild of America against the members of the Alliance of\nMotion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the biggest Hollywood\nstudios. In 2013, she\u2019d begun to develop the idea for what would become\nDickinson, a gothic, at times surreal comedy based on the life of the poet,\nEmily. \u201cI realized you could do one of those visceral, sexy, dangerous half\nhours but make it a period piece,\u201d she said. \u201cI was never trying to write some\nmiddle-of-the-road thing.\u201d She sold the pilot and a plan for at least three\nseasons to Apple in 2017; she would be the showrunner, and the series had the\npotential to become one of the flagship offerings of the company\u2019s streaming\nservice, which had not yet launched.\n\nLooking back, Smith sometimes marvels that Dickinson was made at all. \u201cIt\ncenters an unapologetic, queer female lead,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a poet and\nfeatures her poetry in every episode\u2014hard-to-understand poetry. It has a high\nbarrier of entry.\u201d But that was the time. Apple, like other streamers, was\nlooking to make a splash. \u201cI mean, they made a show out of I Love Dick,\u201d Smith\nsaid, referring to the small-press cult classic by Chris Kraus, adapted into a\n2016 series for Amazon Prime Video. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen because people are\nusing profit as their bottom line.\u201d\n\nIn fact, they weren\u2019t. The streaming model was based on bringing in\nsubscribers\u2014grabbing as much of the market as possible\u2014rather than on earning\nrevenue from individual shows. And big swings brought in new viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s\nlike a whole world of intellectuals and artists got a multibillion-dollar\ngrant from the tech world,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut we mistook that, and were frankly\nactively gaslit into thinking that that was because they cared about art.\u201d\n\nMaking a show for Apple was not what she\u2019d hoped it would be. What the company\nwanted from her and the series never felt clear\u2014there was a \u201cradical\ninformation asymmetry,\u201d she said, regarding management\u2019s priorities and\nmetrics. After she and her colleagues completed the first season of Dickinson,\nthey waited for the streamer to launch and the show to air. Their requests for\na firm timeline and premiere date were ignored. Smith started to worry that\nApple might scrap the idea for the streaming platform altogether, in which\ncase the show might never be seen, or might even disappear\u2014she didn\u2019t have a\ncopy of the finished product. It belonged to Apple and lived on the company\u2019s\nservers.\n\n\u201cIt was communicated to me,\u201d Smith said, \u201cthat my only choice to keep the show\nalive was to begin all over again and write a whole new season without a\ngreen-light guarantee. So I was expected to take on that risk, when the\nentities that stood to profit the most from the success of my creative labor,\nthe platform and studio, would not risk a dime.\u201d \u201cIt was also on me,\u201d she went\non, \u201cto kind of fluff everybody involved in the entire making of the show,\nfrom the stars to the line producer to the costume designer, etcetera, to make\nthem believe that we\u2019d be coming back again and prevent them, sometimes\nunsuccessfully, from taking other jobs.\u201d\n\nFinally, in late 2019, when Smith and her colleagues were two months into\nproduction on Season 2, the show premiered as one of the streamer\u2019s four\noriginal series. It was an immediate critical success and a sensation on\nsocial media. \u201cIn Apple TV+\u2019s initial smattering of shows,\u201d wrote the\nWashington Post, \u201conly \u2018Dickinson\u2019 is a delicious surprise.\u201d It received a\n2019 Peabody Award; in 2021 it made the New York Times\u2019 list of best programs\nof the year and won a Rotten Tomatoes prize for Fan Favorite TV Series.\n\nBut Smith was losing steam. \u201cI was only allowed to make the show to the extent\nthat I was willing to take on unbelievable amounts of risk and labor on my own\nbody perpetually, without ceasing, for years,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I knew that if I\never stopped, the show would die.\u201d It had seemed to her that Apple didn\u2019t\nvalue the series, and she felt at a loss. Smith now knows that Dickinson was\nthe company\u2019s most-watched show in its second and third seasons. But at the\ntime, she had no access to concrete information about its performance. As was\nthe habit among streamers, Apple didn\u2019t share viewership data with its\nwriters. And without that data, Smith had no leverage. In 2020, after three\nseasons, she told Apple that she was done. \u201cI said, I can\u2019t do it anymore. And\nApple said, Okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cPassion can only get you so far,\u201d she told me. But she\u2019d stayed in Hollywood.\n\u201cI\u2019m an artist,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m never going to stop creating.\u201d The\nindustry was still the only place one could make a real living as a writer.\n\u201cWhen people say, Why stay in TV?\u201d she said, \u201cThe answer is, There is nothing\nelse. What do you mean?\u201d\n\nThe truth was that the forces that had opened doors for Smith were the same\nones that had made her individual work seem not to matter. They were the same\nforces that had been degrading writers\u2019 working lives for some time, and they\nwere cannibalizing the business of Hollywood itself.\n\nThanks to decades of deregulation and a gush of speculative cash that first\nhit the industry in the late Aughts, while prestige TV was climbing the rungs\nof the culture, massive entertainment and media corporations had been\nswallowing what few smaller companies remained, and financial firms had been\ninfiltrating the business, moving to reduce risk and maximize efficiency at\nall costs, exhausting writers in evermore unstable conditions.\n\n\u201cThe industry is in a deep and existential crisis,\u201d the head of a midsize\nstudio told me in early August.^* We were in the lounge of the Soho House in\nWest Hollywood. \u201cIt is probably the deepest and most existential crisis it\u2019s\never been in. The writers are losing out. The middle layer of craftsmen are\nlosing out. The top end of the talent are making more money than they ever\nhave, but the nuts-and-bolts people who make the industry go round are losing\nout dramatically.\u201d\n\nHollywood had become a winner-takes-all economy. As of 2021, CEOs at the\nmajority of the largest companies and conglomerates in the industry drew\nsalaries between two hundred and three thousand times greater than those of\nmedian employees. And while writer-producer royalty such as Shonda Rhimes and\nRyan Murphy had in recent years signed deals reportedly worth hundreds of\nmillions of dollars, and a slightly larger group of A-list writers, such as\nSmith, had carved out comfortable or middle-class lives, many more were\nworking in bare-bones, short-term writers\u2019 rooms, often between stints in the\nservice industry, without much hope for more steady work. As of early 2023,\namong those lucky enough to be employed, the median TV writer-producer was\nmaking 23 percent less a week, in real dollars, than their peers a decade\nbefore. Total earnings for feature-film writers had dropped nearly 20 percent\nbetween 2019 and 2021.\n\nWriters had been squeezed by the studios many times in the past, but never\nthis far. And when the WGA went on strike last spring, they were historically\nunified: more guild members than ever before turned out for the vote to\nauthorize, and 97.9 percent voted in favor. After five months, the writers\nwere said to have won: they gained a new residuals model for streaming, new\nminimum lengths of employment for TV, and more guaranteed paid work on\nfeature-film screenplays, among other protections.\n\nBut the business of Hollywood had undergone a foundational change. The new\neffective bosses of the industry\u2014colossal conglomerates, asset-management\ncompanies, and private-equity firms\u2014had not been simply pushing workers too\nhard and grabbing more than their fair share of the profits. They had been\nstripping value from the production system like copper pipes from a\nhouse\u2014threatening the sustainability of the studios themselves. Today\u2019s\nbusiness side does not have a necessary vested interest in \u201cthe business\u201d\u2014in\nthe health of what we think of as Hollywood, a place and system in which\ncreativity is exchanged for capital. The union wins did not begin to address\nthis fundamental problem.\n\nCurrently, the machine is sputtering, running on fumes. According to research\nby Bloomberg, in 2013 the largest companies in film and television were more\nthan $20 billion in the black; by 2022, that number had fallen by roughly\nhalf. From 2021 to 2022, revenue growth for the industry dropped by almost 50\npercent. At U.S. box offices, by the end of last year, revenue was down 22\npercent from 2019. Experts estimate that cable-television revenue has fallen\n40 percent since 2015. Streaming has rarely been profitable at all. Until very\nrecently, Netflix was the sole platform to make money; among the other\ncompanies with streaming services, only Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s platforms may\nhave eked out a profit last year. And now the streaming gold rush\u2014the era that\nmade Dickinson\u2014is over. In the spring of 2022, the Federal Reserve began\nraising interest rates after years of nearly free credit, and at roughly the\nsame time, Wall Street began calling in the streamers\u2019 bets. The stock prices\nof nearly all the major companies with streaming platforms took precipitous\nfalls, and none have rebounded to their prior valuation.\n\nThe industry as a whole is now facing a broad contraction. Between August 2022\nand the end of last year, employment fell by 26 percent\u2014more than one job gone\nin every four. Layoffs hit Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Paramount Global,\nRoku, and others in 2022. In 2023, firings swept through the representation\ngiants United Talent Agency and Creative Artists Agency; Netflix, Paramount\nGlobal, and Roku again; plus Hulu, NBCUniversal, and Lionsgate. In early 2024,\nit was announced that Amazon was cutting hundreds of jobs from its Prime Video\nand Amazon MGM Studios divisions. In February, Paramount Global laid off\nroughly eight hundred people. It\u2019s unclear which streamers will survive. As\nJames Dolan, the interim executive chair of AMC Networks, told employees in\nlate 2022 as he delivered news of massive layoffs\u2014roughly 1,700 people (20\npercent of U.S. staff) would lose their jobs\u2014\u201cthe mechanisms for the\nmonetization of content are in disarray.\u201d\n\nProfit will of course find a way; there will always be shit to watch. But\nwithout radical intervention, whether by the government or the workers, the\nindustry will become unrecognizable. And the writing trade\u2014the kind where one\nactually earns a living\u2014will be obliterated.\n\nGreed is not new to Hollywood. The well-off career we associate with\ntwentieth-century screenwriting came about from a combination of worker action\nand federal regulation. The job was shaped in its early years, beginning in\nthe Twenties, by a cartel of major motion-picture companies that, in 1948,\nwould be found by the Supreme Court to have conspired to fix prices and\nmonopolize the industry. Yet writing for the studios was good, salaried work.\nUp until the brink of the Depression, the companies were rolling in money. In\n1931, average yearly income for a full-time, regularly employed writer was\nmore than $14,000\u2014roughly $273,000 in today\u2019s money\u2014more than three times that\nof the average American.\n\nBut in 1933, both MGM and Paramount Pictures cut screenwriters\u2019 pay by 50\npercent, and writers moved to form a union. The Screen Writers Guild was\ncertified in 1938, and its first contract, in 1942, secured a guaranteed\nbaseline pay of $125 a week\u2014the equivalent of roughly $2,500 today\u2014and the\npower to arbitrate over screenwriting credits, which had previously been at\nthe whim of producers.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruling came down, studio power was dealt another blow.\nThe industry\u2019s eight reigning companies were each forced to enter into an\nagreement with the Department of Justice, collectively known as the Paramount\nDecrees, which prohibited them from both distributing and exhibiting the films\nthey produced\u2014they could do only one or the other. The companies that owned\ntheater chains gave up their cinemas, taking a significant hit. In the years\nthat followed, the studios, less flush with cash, began to prefer freelance\nwriters to salaried employees.\n\nBy the end of the Fifties, when 86 percent of Americans owned a television,\nwriters had piecemeal established limited residual payments but wanted more.\nThe studios\u2014which now made both films and television\u2014claimed that the fast-\nchanging business was too uncertain to increase writers\u2019 cuts, an assertion\nthat, according to the film and media historian Miranda Banks, later\nexecutives would repeat with each major technological innovation in\ndistribution, from cable to VHS tapes to DVDs, and finally to streaming. In\n1960, the union, now the Writers Guild of America, went on strike, soon\nfollowed by the Screen Actors Guild. Both won expanded residuals, increased\nminimums, pensions, and health benefits. Most writers were now freelancers,\nbut they had established a basis for long and stable careers.\n\nOver the next two decades, the writing profession was further bolstered by a\nfederal government that enforced and expanded antitrust law. In 1970, the\nFederal Communications Commission instituted the Financial Interest and\nSyndication Rules\u2014or Fin-Syn\u2014which barred networks from holding ownership\nstakes in the prime-time and syndicated programs that they aired, effectively\nprohibiting film studios from owning TV networks and vice versa, and generally\nincreasing competition. In the mid-Seventies, full-time TV staffers were paid\na minimum of roughly $30,000 a year, almost twice the median family income in\n1976. For high-budget feature-film screenplays, writers made a baseline of\nabout $17,000, or around $95,000 in today\u2019s money.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the early Eighties, when the Reagan Revolution hit Hollywood,\nthat the guardrails began to fall. In 1983, the Department of Justice allowed\nHBO, Columbia Pictures, and CBS to merge to form TriStar Pictures, combining\ncable, film, and broadcast-network interests in direct violation of antitrust\nlaw. Executives at other entertainment companies took note and moved to create\ntheir own conglomerates. In 1985, the DOJ went a step further, issuing a memo,\nlater discovered by the historian Jennifer Holt, stating that it would no\nlonger enforce the Paramount Decrees, and the studios scooped up theater\nchains once again. When the Clinton Administration came to power, it carried\non what its Republican predecessors had begun. In 1993, the FCC began to\nformally repeal the Fin-Syn rules, and in 1996, Clinton signed the\nTelecommunications Act, which removed restrictions on the cross-ownership of\nbroadcast networks and cable providers. In 1994, in an unprecedented deal,\ncable giant Viacom merged with retailer Blockbuster Video, and took over\nParamount Pictures. In 1996, Disney merged with Capital Cities/ABC to become\nthe largest entertainment conglomerate in the world. The next year, Time\nWarner\u2014already the product of two massive corporations, and previously the\nbiggest conglomerate\u2014joined with Turner Broadcasting System and reclaimed the\ncrown. The gates had been opened, and the new monopolization was only just\nbeginning.\n\nAt first, deregulation did not seem to harm writers. The mergers and\nacquisitions opened up synergies across the newly diverse properties within\neach conglomerate, bringing in, according to the historian of Hollywood Tom\nSchatz, unprecedented profits. This coincided with a boom in the theatrical\nbusiness and may have contributed to increasing movie budgets\u2014which\nskyrocketed during the Eighties and Nineties\u2014and increased pay for\nscreenwriters. In the late Eighties and throughout the Nineties, executives\nseemed to have more money to spend than ever before. Studios were hungry for\noriginal material, and invested more in development. They paid writers to try\nout concepts, crack stories, and see what worked. Howard A. Rodman, a writer\nfor the recent HBO series The Idol and a former president of the WGA West, had\nstarted out in 1987. \u201cIn the era that I came up in,\u201d he told me in August, \u201ca\nstudio might develop thirty to forty screenplays to get the one that actually\nsang.\u201d The norm was what\u2019s known as a multistep deal: studios paid up front\nfor ideas, then scripts, then rewrites. Robin Swicord, writer of the\nadaptations for 1994\u2019s Little Women and 2008\u2019s The Curious Case of Benjamin\nButton, told me: \u201cWhen you would walk into someone\u2019s office for a meeting,\nyou\u2019d see behind them a wall of screenplays.\u201d She worked with one executive\nwho oversaw 120 scripts in development in one year.\n\nThere was a heightened interest in \u201cspec\u201d scripts\u2014unsolicited screenplays\u2014and\ndoors seemed to fly open. The writer John Brancato had vaulted into the A-list\nin 1991, when he sold the script that would later become The Game, starring\nMichael Douglas. A year or two later, he told me, he was hired to write a\nmajor movie screenplay\u2014what eventually became The Net, starring Sandra\nBullock\u2014based on only a vague conversation. Pay ranged from solid to life-\nchanging. In 1994 and 1995, original scripts for high-budget movies brought in\na minimum of around $72,000\u2014the equivalent of about $150,000 today.\n\nIn television, deregulation had aided the rise of cable, opening up new\nopportunities for writers. In the mid-Eighties, there had been fewer than\nfifty cable networks; by the end of the Nineties, there were more than two\nhundred, and nearly 70 percent of American homes had access. Multiple series\nfrom HBO, such as Sex and the City, which first aired in 1998, and The\nSopranos, which debuted in 1999, were not only hits but cultural phenomena,\nand other cable networks dove in to scripted content.\n\nA staff writer on a premium cable show in 1998 working for five months would\nmake at least $2,400 a week\u2014adding up to more than $90,000 in today\u2019s money.\nWriters above the entry level would receive lump sums of more than $17,000 for\nauthoring complete episodes. They also earned residuals. Broadcast networks\noften paid writers even more than cable, and writers were usually employed for\nlonger. In September, I spoke with an A-list film and TV writer who worked on\na variety of network shows in the late Nineties and early Aughts. \u201cYou felt\nlike you hit the majors,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were on call twenty-four seven; you\nworked nights. But the given was that you\u2019re getting paid a gazillion dollars.\nIt was an amazing time to be a television writer.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, however, deregulation was already allowing executives to\nshore up extraordinary power, and a new distance was forming between business\ninterests and the production of film and TV. Writers\u2019 fortunes were set to\nchange.\n\nBy the early Aughts, six enormous conglomerates\u2014Disney, General Electric, News\nCorporation, Sony, Time Warner, and Viacom\u2014controlled every major movie studio\nand broadcast network, and a substantial portion of the profitable cable\nbusinesses. The conglomerates were raking in more than 85 percent of all film\nrevenue and producing more than 80 percent of American prime-time television.\nAs these entities grew, business operations became much more complex, and the\nsleight of hand known as Hollywood accounting\u2014obfuscating exactly how much is\nspent and earned, exactly how much is due to be paid out\u2014became much easier\nfor the studios.\n\nWriters were beginning to feel the squeeze. They suspected that they were\nbeing shorted on royalties and residuals, and on their share of profits from\nthe home-video market. At the same time, what was then called New\nMedia\u2014content on the web and for mobile devices\u2014which wasn\u2019t covered under the\nunion contract, was starting to eat into their overall cut. In November 2007,\nthe WGA went on strike. But writers were still making a fairly comfortable\nliving, and others in the industry were not as supportive as they would come\nto be in 2023. \u201cThere was a sense of, \u2018Why are you motherfuckers putting all\nthe dry cleaners and caterers out of work?\u2019 \u201d Rodman told me. \u201c \u2018This is a\npicket line of millionaires against billionaires.\u2019 \u201d The strike was ultimately\nundercut by dissent within the guild. The WGA agreed to an AMPTP offer that\nestablished the right to bargain over New Media and granted writers residuals\nfor material rebroadcast online, but with no increase for DVDs.\n\nWhen the strike was over, it was February 2008. The United States was three\nmonths into what would later be understood as the Great Recession. In an\neffort to stimulate the economy, the Federal Reserve had begun cutting\ninterest rates in September, and over the following eighteen months it\nprovided financial institutions with more than $7.7 trillion in capital. In\nlate 2008, the Fed reduced the interest rate to almost zero. With piles of\ncash and cheap credit in hand, asset-management companies and private-equity\nfirms set out for the frontiers of various U.S. industries. Over the next\ndecade, three asset-management companies\u2014BlackRock, Vanguard, and State\nStreet\u2014would take over American business, becoming the largest shareholders of\n88 percent of the S&P 500, the roughly five hundred biggest public U.S.\ncompanies. Private-equity firms\u2014distinguished by their intent to sell the\nproperties they acquire\u2014would eventually be the backing for at least 7 percent\nof American jobs.\n\nTo these speculators, Hollywood looked like a gold mine: the studios and\nentertainment corporations were ripe with redundancies and inefficiencies to\nbe axed\u2014costs to be cut, parts to be sold, profits to be diverted to\nshareholders, executives, and new, often unrelated ventures. And thanks to the\nderegulation of the preceding decades, the industry was wide open. Financial\ninstitutions could snatch up or take over large portions of companies in any\narea of the business; they could even acquire or substantially invest in\ngroups in competition with one another\u2014and they did, creating types of soft\nmonopoly. Bets were even placed against the traditional industry as a whole,\nin the form of investments in Netflix, which promised to disrupt and dominate\nat-home viewing. Today the Big Three asset-management firms hold the largest\nstakes in most rival companies in media and entertainment. As of the end of\nlast year, Vanguard, for example, owned the largest stake in Disney, Netflix,\nComcast, Apple, and Warner Bros. Discovery. It holds a substantial share of\nAmazon and Paramount Global. By 2010, private-equity companies had acquired\nMGM, Miramax, and AMC Theatres, and had scooped up portions of Hulu and\nDreamWorks. Private equity now has its hands in Univision, Lionsgate,\nSkydance, and more.\n\nThe flood of cash from Wall Street compounded the monopolization under way,\naccelerating mergers and acquisitions, and transforming already massive\nentities into behemoths. Between 2009 and 2019, Disney, for example, purchased\nMarvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox. Comcast purchased NBCUniversal,\nDreamWorks Animation, and Sky. And the financial firms set about extracting\nand multiplying short-term profits. Andrew deWaard, a scholar of the political\neconomy of media, has found that the use of dividends, stock buybacks, and\ncorporate venture capital, all of which siphon revenue away from reinvestment\nin a business and its workforce, exploded in entertainment companies between\n2008 and 2023. Comcast, for instance, which through its subsidiaries owns more\nthan ten TV networks and studios, paid out more than $3.2 billion in dividends\nand stock buybacks in 2008. In 2022, that number topped $18 billion.\n\nThe studios, now beholden to much larger companies and financial institutions,\nbecame subject to oversight focused on short-term horizons. This summer, I\nspoke with the head of a film and TV studio purchased by a private-equity firm\nin recent years. \u201cIt used to be there were these big, crusty, old legacy\ncompanies that had a longer-term view,\u201d he said, \u201cthat could absorb losses,\nand could take risks. But now everything is driven by quarterly results. The\nonly thing that matters is the next board meeting. You don\u2019t make any\ndecisions that have long-term benefits. You\u2019re always just thinking about,\n\u2018How do I meet my numbers?\u2019 \u201d Efficiency and risk avoidance began to run the\ngame.\n\nIn the years following the recession, there was, as Howard Rodman put it, \u201ca\nslow erosion\u201d in feature-film writers\u2019 ability to earn a living. To the new\nbosses, the quantity of money that studios had been spending on developing\nscreenplays\u2014many of which would never be made\u2014was obvious fat to be cut, and\nin the late Aughts, executives increasingly began offering one-step deals,\nguaranteeing only one round of pay for one round of work. Writers, hoping to\nmake it past Go, began doing much more labor\u2014multiple steps of development\u2014for\nwhat was ostensibly one step of the process. In separate interviews, Dana\nStevens, writer of The Woman King, and Robin Swicord described the change\nusing exactly the same words: \u201cFree work was encoded.\u201d So was safe material.\nIn an effort to anticipate what a studio would green-light, writers\nincorporated feedback from producers and junior executives, constructing what\nbecame known as producer\u2019s drafts. As Rodman explained it: \u201cYour producer says\nto you, \u2018I love your script. It\u2019s a great first draft. But I know what the\nstudio wants. This isn\u2019t it. So I need you to just make this protagonist more\nlikable, and blah, blah, blah.\u2019 And you do it.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the fees that writers could charge for their work were being\npushed down. Talent agents, who had previously advocated for their writers to\nmake as much money as possible, were now employed by much larger companies\nthat derived their revenue from a variety of other sources and controlled the\nmarket for writer representation. By 2019, the major Hollywood agencies had\nbeen consolidated into an oligopoly of four companies that controlled more\nthan 75 percent of WGA writers\u2019 earnings. And in the 2010s, high finance\nreached the agencies: by 2014, private equity had acquired Creative Artists\nAgency and William Morris Endeavor, and the latter had purchased IMG. Meeting\nbenchmarks legible to the new bosses\u2014deals actually made, projects off the\nground\u2014pushed agents to function more like producers, and writers began\nhearing that their asking prices were too high.\n\nExecutives, meanwhile, increasingly believed that they\u2019d found their best bet\nin \u201cIP\u201d: preexisting intellectual property\u2014familiar stories, characters, and\nproducts\u2014that could be milled for scripts. As an associate producer of a\nsuccessful Aughts IP-driven franchise told me, IP is \u201csort of a hedge.\u201d\nThere\u2019s some knowledge of the consumer\u2019s interest, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of\ndry run for the story.\u201d Screenwriter Zack Stentz, who co-wrote the 2011 movies\nThor and X-Men: First Class, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s a way to take risk out of the\nequation as much as possible.\u201d\n\nBrancato, who himself found work on Catwoman and two movies in the Terminator\nfranchise in the early Aughts, told me that by the middle of the decade, no\none wanted original scripts. IP had proved extremely valuable on the\ninternational market\u2014increasingly important as domestic box-office growth\nstagnated over the course of the Aughts and 2010s\u2014and it began to make up a\ngreater and greater share of studio output. According to the media historian\nShawna Kidman, franchise movies had accounted for around 25 percent of all\nstudios\u2019 wide-release features in 2000; in 2017 they made up more than 64\npercent.\n\nThe shift to IP further tipped the scales of power. Multiple writers I spoke\nwith said that selecting preexisting characters and cinematic worlds gave\nexecutives a type of psychic edge, allowing them to claim a degree of creative\ncredit. And as IP took over, the perceived authority of writers diminished.\nJulie Bush, a writer-producer for the Apple TV+ limited series Manhunt, told\nme, \u201cExecutives get to feel like the author of the work, even though they have\na screenwriter, like me, basically create a story out of whole cloth.\u201d At the\nsame time, the biggest IP success story, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, by far\nthe highest-earning franchise of all time, pioneered a production apparatus in\nwhich writers were often separated from the conception and creation of a\nmovie\u2019s overall story. \u201cWorking on these big franchises is a little bit like\nbeing a stonemason on a medieval cathedral,\u201d Stentz told me. \u201cI can point\ntoward this little corner, or this arch, and say, That was me.\u201d Within this\nsystem, writers have sometimes been withheld basic information, such as the\narc of a project. Joanna Robinson, co-author of the book MCU: The Reign of\nMarvel Studios, told me that the writers for WandaVision, a Marvel show for\nDisney+, had to craft almost the entirety of the series\u2019 single season without\nknowing where their work was ultimately supposed to arrive: the ending\nremained undetermined, because executives had not yet decided what other\nstories they might spin off from the show. Marvel also began to use so many\nwriters for each project that it became difficult to determine who was\nresponsible for a given idea. Multiple writers who worked on Guardians of the\nGalaxy, The Incredible Hulk, The Avengers, and Thor: Ragnarok have forced WGA\narbitration with the company to recoup the credits and earnings that they\nbelieve they\u2019re due.\n\nMarvel\u2019s practices have been widely emulated, especially for franchise\nproductions. \u201cEvery other studio with big tentpole movies has tried to imitate\nthe Marvel model,\u201d Stentz told me, including \u201cthrowing waves of writers at the\nsame project.\u201d \u201cIn some cases,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve gone even further, by\nconvening entire writers\u2019 rooms\u201d\u2014a standard practice only in television. Both\nthe Avatar sequels (one of which is not yet out) and Terminator: Dark Fate\nwere developed this way, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s high-profile IP involved,\u201d Brancato told me, \u201cwriters tend to be\ntreated as disposable.\u201d \u201cEverybody\u2019s feeling fucked over,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\ngeneral sense is that you\u2019re an absolutely fungible widget, and they don\u2019t any\nlonger take you seriously. It\u2019s so broken. I mean, really, it is fucking\nbroken.\u201d\n\nThe post-recession flood of cash and credit played out very differently in the\nworld of television: for years, creative workers considered it an incredible\nboon. It opened the industry to new writers, new subjects, and powered an era\nthat actually seemed defined by risk-taking.\n\nNetflix had convinced Wall Street that its value could be measured by\nsubscriber growth, rather than short-term profit, and the streamers that came\nsoon after it adopted the same model. The streaming ecosystem was built on a\nwager: high subscriber numbers would translate to large market shares, and\neventually, profit. Under this strategy, an enormous amount of money could be\nspent on shows that might or might not work: more shows meant more\nopportunities to catch new subscribers. Producers and writers for streamers\nwere able to put ratings aside, which at first seemed to be a luxury. Netflix\npaid writers large fees up front, and guaranteed that an entire season of a\nshow would be produced. By the mid-2010s, the sheer quantity of series across\nthe new platforms\u2014what\u2019s known as \u201cPeak TV\u201d\u2014opened opportunities for unusually\noffbeat projects (see BoJack Horseman, a cartoon for adults about an equine\nhas-been sitcom star), and substantially more shows created by women and\nwriters of color. In 2009, across cable, broadcast, and streaming, 189\noriginal scripted shows aired or released new episodes; in 2016, that number\nwas 496. In 2022, it was 849.\n\nThe need for writers was enormous. But thanks in part to the cultural success\nof the new era, supply soon overshot demand. For those who beat out the\ncompetition, the work became much less steady than it had been in the pre-\nstreaming era. According to insiders, in the past, writers for a series had\nusually been employed for around eight months, crafting long seasons and\nstaying on board through a show\u2019s production. Junior writers often went to the\nsets where their shows were made and learned how to take a story from the page\nto the screen\u2014how to talk to actors, how to stay within budget, how to take a\nstudio\u2019s notes\u2014setting them up to become showrunners. Now, in an innovation\ncalled mini-rooms, reportedly first ventured by cable channels such as AMC and\nStarz, fewer writers were employed for each series and for much shorter\nperiods\u2014usually eight to ten weeks but as little as four. The weekly pay still\nput most other work to shame: between 2020 and 2023, a staff writer in a ten-\nweek mini-room made at least $5,000 a week. But getting staffed for multiple\nrooms in a year was a challenge at best. Residual payments\u2014which at the time\ndid not account for a show\u2019s success among viewers\u2014were often tiny. One\nwriter, who ran a show for Apple TV+ in 2020 and 2021, told me that his\nresiduals were \u201cnear zero.\u201d Justin Boyd, who around the same time wrote for\nboth Netflix and AMC, said that his network residuals were roughly double what\nthey were for the streaming platform.\n\nWriters in the new mini-room system were often dismissed before their series\nwent to production, which meant that they rarely got the opportunity to go to\nset and weren\u2019t getting the skills they needed to advance. Showrunners were\nleft responsible for all writing-related tasks when these rooms shut down. \u201cIt\nbroke a lot of showrunners,\u201d the A-list film and TV writer told me.\n\u201cPhysically, mentally, financially. It also ruined a lot of shows.\u201d\n\nThe price of entry for working in Hollywood had been high for a long time:\nunpaid internships, low-paid assistant jobs. But now the path beyond the entry\nlevel was increasingly unclear. Jason Grote, who was a staff writer on Mad Men\nand who came to TV from playwriting, told me, \u201cIt became like a hobby for\npeople, or something more like theater\u2014you had your other day jobs or you had\na trust fund.\u201d Brenden Gallagher, a TV writer a decade in, said, \u201cThere are\nperiods of time where I work at the Apple Store. I\u2019ve worked doing data entry,\nI\u2019ve worked doing research, I\u2019ve worked doing copywriting.\u201d Since he\u2019d started\nin the business in 2014, in his mid-twenties, he\u2019d never had more than eight\nmonths at a time when he didn\u2019t need a source of income from outside the\nindustry.\n\nIn the end, the precarity created by this new regime seems to have had a\ndisastrous effect on efforts to diversify writers\u2019 rooms. \u201cThere was this\nfeeling,\u201d the head of the midsize studio told me that day at Soho House,\n\u201cduring the last ten years or so, of, \u2018Oh, we need to get more people of color\nin writers\u2019 rooms.\u2019 \u201d But what you get now, he said, is the black or Latino\nperson who went to Harvard. \u201cThey\u2019re getting the shot, but you don\u2019t actually\nsee a widening of the aperture to include people who grew up poor, maybe went\nto a state school or not even, and are just really talented. That has not\nhappened at all.\u201d To the extent that this was better than no change, he said,\n\u201cWriters\u2019 rooms are more diverse just in time for there not to be any writers\u2019\nrooms anymore.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the 2010s, it was clear that something had to give or the\nindustry would be facing a dearth of trained talent. \u201cThe Sopranos does not\nexist without David Chase having worked in television for almost thirty\nyears,\u201d Blake Masters, a writer-producer and creator of the Showtime series\nBrotherhood, told me. \u201cBecause The Sopranos really could not be written by\nsomebody unless they understood everything about television, and hated all of\nit.\u201d Grote said much the same thing: \u201cPrestige TV wasn\u2019t new blood coming into\nHollywood as much as it was a lot of veterans that were never able to tell\nthese types of stories, who were suddenly able to cut through.\u201d\n\nNetflix, the other streamers, and the networks weren\u2019t just destabilizing the\ncareers of individual writers: they were stealing from the industry\u2019s future.\nBut things were once again worse than they seemed. The streamers, which would\nsoon employ about half of TV-series writers, were thoroughly speculative\nventures, and they were set to expand and contract with the whims of the\nmarket.\n\nIn April 2022, Netflix told investors that it had lost two hundred thousand\nsubscribers in the first quarter of the year. It expected to lose two million\nusers in the next three months. Within days, its stock price fell by 35\npercent. By September, it was down 60 percent. By November, the share price of\nWarner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of Max, had dropped by 61 percent;\nParamount, by 49; Disney, by 44; and Comcast, by 38. Meanwhile, tensions\nbetween writers and executives were rising, and by the time the WGA\u2019s board of\ndirectors was preparing for its triennial negotiations with the AMPTP, in the\nspring of 2023, they knew they were in for a fight.\n\nThe strike was called on May Day. In July, the actors guild, SAG-AFTRA, also\nstruck, turning up the pressure on the AMPTP, and in late September, the\nstudios and writers made a deal. In October, just days after the new contract\nwas ratified, I spoke with Adam Conover, writer, creator, and star of truTV\u2019s\nAdam Ruins Everything and a member of the 2023 WGA negotiating committee. The\nAMPTP had been shortsighted, he told me, locked in an old view of their labor\nforce. \u201cThey didn\u2019t realize that they did their job too well,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWorkers actually got pushed out, actually got their wages cut.\u201d The studios\u2019\nown systems had already forced many writers to take second and third jobs; the\nworkers were not anywhere near as dependent on industry pay as they had been\nin the past. And they were furious. Compared with the stoppage in 2007 and\n2008, one producer told me, \u201cthis felt more like scorched earth.\u201d Many writers\nI talked to during the strike spoke of the executives with a mix of anger and\ndisbelief. Boyd told me, \u201cThey cannot do what we do. And they hate us for it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the studios had any reckoning,\u201d Rodman said, \u201cof the solidarity\nand militancy that their own greed created in the people who create their\nwealth.\u201d\n\nIn the end, that solidarity succeeded in establishing a new streaming-\nresiduals model\u2014based on numbers of views\u2014minimum staffing requirements and\nlengths of employment for TV writers\u2019 rooms, and at least two rounds of\nguaranteed work for feature screenplays. The union had also forced streamers\nto release some viewership data, and had established that AI could not be\ngiven writing credit for anything: a human author would have to be involved\nand paid, regardless of AI output.\n\nBut as the dust has settled, it has become clear that there are several\nsignificant problems with the new agreement. The writers\u2019-room staffing rules\nkick in only if a showrunner decides to bring on help at the start of a deal;\notherwise, they can write a season on their own. It would often benefit them\nto go the latter route\u2014budgets, after all, are shrinking\u2014and studios would\nlikely prefer this. One writer told me that by the start of 2024, he\u2019d already\nseen showrunners use the loophole. As for the data-sharing agreement, a closer\nlook reveals it to be, as deWaard put it, \u201cvery limited, and very fragile.\u201d\nThe studios will share viewership information with a limited number of WGA\nadministrators for high-budget shows. The guild can then release that\ninformation only in a summary form, which, in the words of the contract,\naggregates the data \u201con an overall industry level.\u201d The guild cannot share any\ninformation at all on the performance of individual shows. A WGA\nrepresentative told me that there would be no secondary process for writers to\nobtain that data.\n\nThe threshold for receiving the viewership-based streaming residuals is also\nincredibly high: a show must be viewed by at least 20 percent of a platform\u2019s\ndomestic subscribers \u201cin the first 90 days of release, or in the first 90 days\nin any subsequent exhibition year.\u201d As Bloomberg reported in November, fewer\nthan 5 percent of the original shows that streamed on Netflix in 2022 would\nhave met this benchmark. \u201cI am not impressed,\u201d the A-list writer told me in\nJanuary. Entry-level TV staffing, where more and more writers are getting\nstuck, \u201cis still a subsistence-level job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job for rich\nkids.\u201d\n\nConover said that the most important facts were that guild leadership had kept\nmembers unified and that a new streaming-residuals structure was now in place;\nthey could fight to raise the rates during the next round of negotiations, in\n2026. \u201cOnce something is a number on a piece of paper,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can do a\nlot with it.\u201d The majority of writers I spoke with this winter said that it\nwas too soon to tell what the impact of the new contract would be. A group\nalmost as large said that the agreement did not address the fundamental\nproblems in the business.\n\nBrenden Gallagher, who echoed Conover\u2019s belief that the union was well-\npositioned to gain more in 2026, put it this way: \u201cMy view is that there was a\nlot of wishful thinking about achieving this new middle class, based around,\nto paraphrase 30 Rock, making it 1997 again through science or magic. Will\nthere be as big a working television-writer cohort that is making six figures\na year consistently living in Los Angeles as there was from 1992 to 2021? No.\nThat\u2019s never going to come back.\u201d\n\nSince the end of the strike, the industry has continued to contract. \u201cIt\u2019s a\ngreat shaking-out point,\u201d the A-list writer told me. \u201cA lot of people who are\nvery smart are willing to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what it is going to be in a year,\nbut it ain\u2019t going to be this.\u2019 \u201d Barry Schwartz, a film and TV writer in the\nindustry for almost two decades, told me that post-strike, mid-career writers\nare making \u201cextremely conservative choices.\u201d \u201cPeople aren\u2019t speccing,\u201d he\nsaid\u2014submitting uncontracted scripts\u2014\u201cand if they are, it\u2019s not original\nstuff. People are chasing IP or waiting on an assignment.\u201d And younger\nwriters, he said, are keeping their heads down.\n\nAs for what types of TV and movies can get made by those who stick around,\nKelvin Yu, creator and showrunner of the Disney+ series American Born Chinese,\ntold me: \u201cI think that there will be an industry move to the middle in terms\nof safer, four-quadrant TV.\u201d (In L.A., a \u201cfour-quadrant\u201d project is one that\naims to appeal to all demographics.) \u201cI think a lot of people,\u201d he said, \u201cwho\nwere disenfranchised or marginalized\u2014their drink tickets are up.\u201d Indeed,\nmultiple writers and executives told me that following the strike, studio\nchoices have skewed even more conservative than before. \u201cIt seems like buyers\nare much less adventurous,\u201d one writer said. \u201cBuyers are looking for Friends.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to believe that this type of caution will pay off. The\nsupposed sure shot of IP is currently misfiring: in 2023, Disney\u2019s The Marvels\nfell more than $64 million short of breaking even, and its Indiana Jones\nsequel drastically underperformed. The Flash, for Warner Bros. Discovery, lost\nmillions, and the company\u2019s Shazam! Fury of the Gods flopped. (In the case of\nBarbie\u2014the loudest exception\u2014the writers, Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, were\ngiven extraordinary free rein.) As Zack Stentz put it, \u201cHollywood is based on\ngiving audiences what they might not know. Any attempt to drive risk out of\nthat process is sooner or later doomed to failure.\u201d His words played off an\nold adage by the screenwriter William Goldman. \u201cNobody knows anything,\u201d he\nwrote. \u201cNot one person in the entire motion picture field knows for certain\nwhat\u2019s going to work.\u201d But investments in the alchemy of the creative process\ndo not perform well in quarterly reports.\n\nThe film and TV industry is now controlled by only four major companies, and\nit is shot through with incentives to devalue the actual production of film\nand television. What is to be done? The most direct solution would be\ngovernment intervention. If it wanted to, a presidential administration could\nenforce existing antitrust law, break up the conglomerates, and begin to pull\nentertainment companies loose from asset-management firms. It could regulate\nthe use of financial tools, as deWaard has suggested; it could rein in private\nequity. The government could also increase competition directly by funding\nmore public film and television. It could establish a universal basic income\nfor artists and writers.\n\nNone of this is likely to happen. The entertainment and finance industries\nspend enormous sums lobbying both parties to maintain deregulation and\nprioritize the private sector. Writers will have to fight the studios again,\nbut for more sweeping reforms. One change in particular has the potential to\nflip the power structure of the industry on its head: writers could demand to\nown complete copyright for the stories they create. They currently have\nsomething called \u201cseparated rights,\u201d which allow a writer to use a script and\nits characters for limited purposes. But if they were to retain complete\ncopyright, they would have vastly more leverage. Nearly every writer I spoke\nwith seemed to believe that this would present a conflict with the way the\nunion functions. This point is complicated and debatable, but Shawna Kidman\nand the legal expert Catherine Fisk\u2014both preeminent scholars of copyright and\nmedia\u2014told me that the greater challenge is Hollywood\u2019s structure. The\nbusiness is currently built around studio ownership. While Kidman found the\nidea of writer ownership infeasible, Fisk said it was possible, though it\nwould be extremely difficult. Pushing for copyright would essentially mean\ngoing to war with the studios. But if things continue on their current path,\nwriters may have to weigh such hazards against the prospect of the end of\ntheir profession. Or, they could leave it all behind.\n\nFrom the\n\nMay 2024 issue\n\n#### From the Archive\n\nTimeless stories from our 173-year archive handpicked to speak to the news of\nthe day.\n\n### Got it!
