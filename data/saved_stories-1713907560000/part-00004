The answer may no longer be a mystery:\nKrebsOnSecurity found compelling clues suggesting the intrusion was carried\nout by the same Russian hacking crew that stole of millions of payment card\nrecords from big box retailers like Home Depot and Target in the years that\nfollowed.\n\nQuestions about who stole tax and financial data on roughly three quarters of\nall South Carolina residents came to the fore last week at the confirmation\nhearing of Mark Keel, who was appointed in 2011 by Gov. Nikki Haley to head\nthe state\u2019s law enforcement division. If approved, this would be Keel\u2019s third\nsix-year term in that role.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that Keel was careful not to release many details\nabout the breach at his hearing, telling lawmakers he knows who did it but\nthat he wasn\u2019t ready to name anyone.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that we didn\u2019t come up with a whole lot of people\u2019s\ninformation that got breached is a testament to the work that people have done\non this case,\u201d Keel asserted.\n\nA ten-year retrospective published in 2022 by The Post and Courier in\nColumbia, S.C. said investigators determined the breach began on Aug. 13,\n2012, after a state IT contractor clicked a malicious link in an email. State\nofficials said they found out about the hack from federal law enforcement on\nOctober 10, 2012.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity examined posts across dozens of cybercrime forums around that\ntime, and found only one instance of someone selling large volumes of tax data\nin the year surrounding the breach date.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 2012 \u2014 three days before South Carolina officials say they first\nlearned of the intrusion \u2014 a notorious cybercriminal who goes by the handle\n\u201cRescator\u201d advertised the sale of \u201ca database of the tax department of one of\nthe states.\u201d\n\n\u201cBank account information, SSN and all other information,\u201d Rescator\u2019s sales\nthread on the Russian-language crime forum Embargo read. \u201cIf you purchase the\nentire database, I will give you access to it.\u201d\n\nA week later, Rescator posted a similar offer on the exclusive Russian forum\nMazafaka, saying he was selling information from a U.S. state tax database,\nwithout naming the state. Rescator said the data exposed included Social\nSecurity Number (SSN), employer, name, address, phone, taxable income, tax\nrefund amount, and bank account number.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of information, I am ready to sell the entire database, with\naccess to the database, and in parts,\u201d Rescator told Mazafaka members. \u201cThere\nis also information on corporate taxpayers.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 26, 2012, the state announced the breach publicly. State officials\nsaid they were working with investigators from the U.S. Secret Service and\ndigital forensics experts from Mandiant, which produced an incident report\n(PDF) that was later published by South Carolina Dept. of Revenue.\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the Secret Service, South Carolina\nprosecutors, and Mr. Keel\u2019s office. This story will be updated if any of them\nrespond. Update: The Secret Service declined to comment.\n\nOn Nov. 18, 2012, Rescator told fellow denizens of the forum Verified he was\nselling a database of 65,000 records with bank account information from\nseveral smaller, regional financial institutions. Rescator\u2019s sales thread on\nVerified listed more than a dozen database fields, including account number,\nname, address, phone, tax ID, date of birth, employer and occupation.\n\nAsked to provide more context about the database for sale, Rescator told forum\nmembers the database included financial records related to tax filings of a\nU.S. state. Rescator added that there was a second database of around 80,000\ncorporations that included social security numbers, names and addresses, but\nno financial information.\n\nThe AP says South Carolina paid $12 million to Experian for identity theft\nprotection and credit monitoring for its residents after the breach.\n\n\u201cAt the time, it was one of the largest breaches in U.S. history but has since\nbeen surpassed greatly by hacks to Equifax, Yahoo, Home Depot, Target and\nPlayStation,\u201d the AP\u2019s Jeffrey Collins wrote.\n\nAs it happens, Rescator\u2019s criminal hacking crew was directly responsible for\nthe 2013 breach at Target and the 2014 hack of Home Depot. The Target\nintrusion saw Rescator\u2019s cybercrime shops selling roughly 40 million stolen\npayment cards, and 56 million cards from Home Depot customers.\n\nWho is Rescator? On Dec. 14, 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published the results of a\n10-year investigation into the identity of Rescator, a.k.a. Mikhail Borisovich\nShefel, a 36-year-old who lives in Moscow and who recently changed his last\nname to Lenin.\n\nMr. Keel\u2019s assertion that somehow the efforts of South Carolina officials\nfollowing the breach may have lessened its impact on citizens seems unlikely.\nThe stolen tax and financial data appears to have been sold openly on\ncybercrime forums by one of the Russian underground\u2019s most aggressive and\nsuccessful hacking crews.\n\nWhile there are no indications from reviewing forum posts that Rescator ever\nsold the data, his sales threads came at a time when the incidence of tax\nrefund fraud was skyrocketing.\n\nTax-related identity theft occurs when someone uses a stolen identity and SSN\nto file a tax return in that person\u2019s name claiming a fraudulent refund.\nVictims usually first learn of the crime after having their returns rejected\nbecause scammers beat them to it. Even those who are not required to file a\nreturn can be victims of refund fraud, as can those who are not actually owed\na refund from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nAccording to a 2013 report from the Treasury Inspector General\u2019s office, the\nIRS issued nearly $4 billion in bogus tax refunds in 2012, and more than $5.8\nbillion in 2013. The money largely was sent to people who stole SSNs and other\ninformation on U.S. citizens, and then filed fraudulent tax returns on those\nindividuals claiming a large refund but at a different address.\n\nIt remains unclear why Shefel has never been officially implicated in the\nbreaches at Target, Home Depot, or in South Carolina. It may be that Shefel\nhas been indicted, and that those indictments remain sealed for some reason.\nPerhaps prosecutors were hoping Shefel would decide to leave Russia, at which\npoint it would be easier to apprehend him if he believed no one was looking\nfor him.\n\nBut all signs are that Shefel is deeply rooted in Russia, and has no plans to\nleave. In January 2024, authorities in Australia, the United States and the\nU.K. levied financial sanctions against 33-year-old Russian man Aleksandr\nErmakov for allegedly stealing data on 10 million customers of the Australian\nhealth insurance giant Medibank.\n\nA week after those sanctions were put in place, KrebsOnSecurity published a\ndeep dive on Ermakov, which found that he co-ran a Moscow-based IT security\nconsulting business along with Mikhail Shefel called Shtazi-IT.\n\nA Google-translated version of Shtazi dot ru.

And related questions such as how in the world\nan IT consultant or employee (a) could fall for such a scheme (yes, I know how\ngood they can be, and how they get more credible or persuasive over time, but\n...), and (b) NOT have seriously layered protection over the state\u2019s data to\nseverely limit whatever data was exposed?\n\nBy the way, it is questions like these that convinced me it was time to retire\nfrom IT management in health care.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n    1.
