It is imperative that we end it.\n\n#### Kevin Erdmann\n\nApr 10, 2024 \u2014 13 min read\n\nThe last few decades of American housing have passed through several phases of\na vicious policy cycle. There may be nothing more urgent than ending it.\n\nA polity can find itself in a vicious cycle where bad public policy leads to\nbad outcomes. Instead of retracting that policy, additional policies are\nlayered atop it, each with their own unintended consequences, which, in turn,\nattract more layers of new policies.\n\nThis is common with issues like immigration, drugs, and sex. In those arenas,\none sign of ineffective policy is the rise of black markets. You might say\nthat the increasingly common tent encampments in our major cities are our\nhousing black markets.\n\n## Policy Cycle 1: Closed Access Cities (mislabeled the Superstar Cities)\n\nThe policy vicious cycle began in the early twentieth century when major\nAmerican cities started to experiment with local zoning ordinances. The\nvicious cycle was codified in the 1926 Supreme Court decision, Euclid v.\nAmbler, where the court called apartment buildings parasitical and opened up a\ncentury where city-building as it had necessarily occurred in the past could\nbe outlawed as a nuisance.\n\nSome cities which had developed before zoning have declared themselves\nillegal. The New York City planning department, ironically, resides in a\nbuilding that the department would be required to reject if it were proposed\ntoday and that is also, officially, a National Landmark.\n\n### Closed Access outcomes\n\nBy the end of the twentieth century, the New York City, Los Angeles, Boston,\nand San Francisco metropolitan areas had encased themselves so securely within\narbitrary rules against city-building that they lost the ability to grow. I\nrefer to these as the Closed Access cities. From 1994 through 1999, annual\npermits for new homes had fallen below 3 units per thousand residents in the\nClosed Access cities.\n\nAbout 6 units per thousand residents are required to maintain low, normal\npopulation growth. Among other cities, metropolitan areas like Detroit and\nChicago were permitting about 4 units per thousand residents at the time.\nSuccessful, growing cities permit well more than 10. The Closed Access cities\nhad become extreme low outliers in housing production. Their ability to house\nresidents had become unsustainably low.\n\nResidents of the cities that lack adequate housing must engage in a game of\nhousing \u201cmusical chairs\u201d. When there aren\u2019t enough new homes, residents must\nbid for existing homes. For rich residents, housing is mostly a luxury. So\nwhen the bidding war pushes prices up, rather than pay more, they opt for\nless. In practice, that means moving to a neighborhood that would have\npreviously housed families who were slightly less rich.\n\nFor families with lower incomes, housing is less of a luxury and more of a\nnecessity. At some point, there are no more bedrooms to give up. No longer\ncommute to bear. It becomes a stark choice between paying more, choosing to be\nregionally displaced, or becoming homeless.\n\nEconomists call this filtering. In cities that allow enough new housing, older\nhomes become more affordable. New residents of older neighborhoods typically\nhave lower incomes than the previous residents. Where housing is in short\nsupply, the filtering goes in the other direction. The new residents of older\nhomes tend to have higher incomes than the previous residents. The prices of\nthose homes rise.\n\nSo, when housing is in short supply, rents and prices rise the most in the\npoorest neighborhoods. Their residents have the fewest options. This leads to\na self-selection of remaining families. Families either have high enough\nincomes to trade down and remain in the city, or they are willing to spend\nmore of their lower incomes to avoid displacement, or they are displaced. When\nabout 1% of a city\u2019s population is forced to leave each year, after a couple\ndecades, the compositional effects of that exodus add up.\n\nNew research is starting to highlight the effects of this problem. Researchers\nhave been discovering that the high gross incomes of the Closed Access cities\nare not high once the cost of housing is accounted for. It is increasingly\nclear that residents of the Closed Access cities don\u2019t have higher incomes\nbecause those cities are \u201csuperstars\u201d. Those cities have instead failed their\npoorest residents. The typical college educated resident of the housing\ndeprived cities is just breaking even compared to similar workers in other\ncities. And, workers with less education are worse off than workers in other\ncities. The difference in incomes between cities is mostly due to housing\ndisplacement. The poorest residents have to make a hard choice. They either\nchoose poverty over displacement by paying the high cost of housing or they\nchoose displacement, which raises the average incomes of those who remain.\n\n### Misunderstanding Closed Access outcomes\n\nIn the past, successful cities didn\u2019t become such outliers in average incomes.\nThey mostly grew larger. Every new engineer that moved to Detroit in the early\ntwentieth century was joined by teachers, police officers, waitresses, clerks,\netc. The average Detroit income was only moderately higher than other cities.\nMostly, it grew.\n\nToday, the cities with high incomes are the slowest-growing cities in the\ncountry. Their rates of net domestic migration are the worst in the country.\nAn anthropologist looking at only their population and migration trends would\nassume there had been a famine or a natural disaster. It is their outmigration\nthat is unusual.\n\nAre those cities popular? How would we know? There aren\u2019t actually hordes of\nnewcomers moving in. We are left only to presume that phantom newcomers would\nlike to move in. Locals only have the impression that there are many newcomers\nbecause, without more housing, each newcomer brings problems for locals\ninstead of opportunities. From 1995 to 2022, the Los Angeles metropolitan area\ngrew by a total of 10%. Dallas-Fort Worth grew by 77%. The US by 25%. It isn\u2019t\nremotely clear that demand for living in Los Angeles is higher than Dallas.\n\n## Policy Cycle 2: Housing Refugees (mislabeled the Housing Bubble)\n\nAs the century turned, these pressures mounted. Each year, migration away from\nthe Closed Access cities increased. By the mid-2000s, net domestic migration\nreached about 1.5% of the Closed Access population annually.\n\n### Housing Refugee outcomes\n\nThe cities they moved to (Florida from the northeast, and Arizona, Nevada, and\ninland California from the California coast) became the emblems of a housing\nbubble. Eventually, the exodus from the Closed Access cities overwhelmed the\nability of growing cities to grow even faster, and home prices in those cities\nstarted to rise. Those high prices were the motivation of countless\nretrospectives from Mian and Sufi\u2019s \u201cHouse of Debt\u201d to Michael Lewis\u2019 \u201cThe Big\nShort\u201d.\n\nMany outcomes you might think happened, didn\u2019t. During the subprime mortgage\nboom, the convention says that \u201canyone with a pulse\u201d could get a mortgage.\nYet, homeownership peaked by early 2004, before the subprime lending boom and\nwell before the CDO markets highlighted in the Big Short were in vogue. The\nincome of the median homeowner actually increased between the mid-1990s and\nthe mid-2000s, relative to the median renter. New homeowners were more likely\nto have a college education and work in the professions. Homeowners weren\u2019t\nbuying bigger or better homes compared to renters. By 2007 lending was\nbecoming risky, but it was families with the highest incomes who were taking\non mortgage payments that claimed more than 40% of their incomes, not families\nunqualified for home ownership.\n\n#### Misunderstanding Housing Refugee outcomes\n\nThe terms of mortgages became riskier but, all considered, the qualifications\nof new homeowners generally did not. Families were playing housing \u201cmusical\nchairs\u201d. And, \u201cmusical chairs\u201d attracts speculators.\n\nPrices\n\nThe high cost of housing in the poorest neighborhoods of the Closed Access\ncities led to a popular belief that loose lending fueled the price bubble by\nallowing poor families to take on untenable mortgages. When I controlled for\nthe regressive effect of inadequate housing supply, I found evidence for a\nmoderate credit boom. Expanded credit access, on average, was associated with\nan increase in home prices of about 8% from 2002 to 2006, which then reversed.\n(That is actually a larger economic effect than other research finds.) But,\nmost of the boost in prices associated with credit access was in markets where\nprices and construction activity were moderate.\n\nThe much more important factor raising prices was inadequate housing in the\nClosed Access cities. Prices remain elevated today in those cities in the same\nway they were then, with much tighter lending practices. Prices in the cities\nthat took on their wave of housing refugees temporarily spiked and then\nreversed after the wave of migration dissipated during the Great Recession.\n\nThe cities that families were flooding away from and the cities that families\nwere flooding into looked different in subtle but important ways.\n\nPrices generally only appreciated excessively in the poorest neighborhoods of\ncities that were collectively losing hundreds of thousands of existing\nresidents each year to that faminesque migration. But the temporary rise in\nprices in the quintessential \u201cbubble\u201d cities where those families fled to was\nnot particularly higher in poorer neighborhoods.\n\nResearchers who did not correctly center Closed Access migration in their\nstudy designs simply did not look for those differences.\n\nConstruction Boom\n\nMany of the worst policy decisions were based on the idea that a credit bubble\nhad created a glut of housing. In reality, there were three types of cities,\nnone of which fit that description. Construction activity increased in the\nClosed Access cities and the Contagion cities that took on their migrants.\nVacancies were low there. They really needed homes. Prices and construction\nactivity were moderate elsewhere.\n\nOn a per capita basis, national housing production was never very high, and\nthe small amount of increased construction had reversed by the end of 2007,\neven in bubble regions like Nevada and Arizona. The peak of vacancies in 2009\nand 2010 happened well after the collapse in construction had more than\nreversed any additional building in any city. Vacancies were due to a broken\neconomy and the arrest of decades-old migration trends, not a glut of homes.\nThe record is clear.\n\n## Policy Cycle 3: Lending Prohibition (mislabeled the Housing Supply Glut)\n\nIf prices in 2006 were mostly high because of supply constraints and there\nwasn\u2019t a supply glut, then why the collapse?\n\n### Lending Prohibition outcomes\n\nThe origination of the fragile mortgages in the new private subprime and Alt-A\nmortgage markets dried up by early 2007. Then, the pendulum swung too far.\n\nData from the New York Federal Reserve and from Fannie Mae concur. The average\ncredit score of new borrowers remained relatively stable from the 1990s\nthrough 2007. In 2007, the average price of homes getting new Fannie Mae\nmortgages and the average price of homes with existing mortgages were both\nnear $250,000. Prices had appreciated significantly. In 2000, the average\nprice of both had been about $150,000. But, while the values of homes had\nincreased, Fannie Mae was issuing mortgages to the same borrowers in the same\nhouses that they had been for years. Average prices were rising because of the\nurban housing shortage.\n\nThen, by 2009, the average credit score of new borrowers permanently rose by\nabout 40 points. Home values across the country had collapsed, and homes with\nFannie Mae mortgages were no different. By 2009, the price of the average home\nwith existing Fannie Mae mortgages was down to $204,000. But homes with new\nFannie Mae mortgages in 2009 averaged $327,000. Between 2007 and 2009, lending\nto the bottom half of the American housing market imploded and never returned.\nThe federal agencies abandoned their existing customer base and regulators\nforced even stricter standards on banks.\n\n### Misunderstanding Prohibition outcomes\n\nThis was not a reversal of a bubble. It wasn\u2019t inevitable. It wasn\u2019t\nnecessary. And I would argue that it was responsible for the entirety of the\n$5 trillion net loss in real estate wealth between 2007 and 2012. Atlanta\nprovides a keen view into what happened. Atlanta was a metropolitan area that\ndidn\u2019t have a building boom or a price bubble. Real rents declined by about\n15% in Atlanta between 2002 and 2006. The moderate American building boom had\nbeen a boon to Atlanta\u2019s renters.\n\nIn neighborhoods with incomes around $150,000 or higher, Atlanta homes\ntypically sold for about 3 times the average neighborhood income, with\nsurprisingly little variation through boom and bust, from 2002 to 2019.\n\nIn the typical neighborhood with an average income of about $50,000, from 2002\nto 2007, homes sold for about 4 times income. Again, with surprisingly little\nvariation. Then, when lending dried up, home prices in Atlanta neighborhoods\nwith $50,000 incomes collapsed down to 2 times the typical tenant\u2019s income by\nthe end of 2011. Cut in half.\n\nHome prices before 2008 across Atlanta were typical of many cities. It is\ncommon for the price/income ratio of homes to be slightly higher in poorer\nneighborhoods than in richer neighborhoods, even in cities with ample housing,\nlike Atlanta in 2007. In fact, it would be quite odd for it to be the other\nway.\n\nBy 2011, in Atlanta, it was the other way. It would have taken the typical\nworking-class resident of Atlanta fewer years to pay for the home they lived\nin than it would have taken the typical rich resident of Atlanta. This\nremarkable reversal of the norm could only be achieved by making mortgages to\nthose families effectively illegal.\n\nAdd up all those trends in city after city, and the tightened lending\nstandards after 2007 pulled $5 trillion out of the wallets of American\nhomeowners in direct proportion to how little they had to begin with\u2014a deeply\nregressive moral panic.\n\n## Policy Cycle 4: The Rent Crisis (mislabeled the Build-to-Rent boom)\n\nThe suffocation of entry level mortgage lending meant the suffocation of entry\nlevel construction. Before 2006, more than half a million new homes were\nregularly sold each year for less than $200,000. By 2011, barely 100,000 were\nsold at that price point, and that market has never rebounded.\n\n### Rent Crisis outcomes\n\nWhen construction dried up, rents increased. Construction dried up the most\nwhere incomes were low and homes had lost the most value. In Atlanta,\nconstruction dropped by 90% even though it hadn\u2019t risen during the subprime\nboom.\n\nSo, rents subsequently increased the most where home prices had fallen the\nmost. Rents from 2015 to 2021 rose about 40% more in the poorest neighborhoods\nthat had the deepest price drops than they did in the richest neighborhoods\nwhere prices had been more stable after 2007.\n\nNow, the entire country was building at a rate below 3 units per thousand\nresidents. The entire country was playing housing musical chairs. Since this\ncycle of housing deprivation was caused by national mortgage suppression\nrather than local land use policies, costs increased in poor neighborhoods in\nevery city, and they increased the most in the poorest cities.\n\nConstruction of apartments had been strong right up until the September 2008\ncrisis, and then recovered quickly back to pre-crisis activity by 2012. But\nall cities have made multi-family and infill housing too difficult. The United\nStates needs well over a million new homes a year. It has been decades since\nmore than a few hundred thousand apartments have been approved nationally in a\ngiven year. And the time it takes to complete an apartment building has\ndoubled since the 1990s. So, apartments have not been able to fill the gap to\nproduce a sustainable amount of housing since 2008.\n\nWhen prices collapsed, investors and corporations started to buy single-family\nhomes. A new industry of large corporate landlords developed. Finally, rents\nhave increased enough that existing homes sell for as much as new homes.\nOnerous post-crisis mortgage regulations remain in place. The tenants for\nthese homes generally cannot buy them. So corporate landlords order the new\nhomes.\n\n### Misunderstanding Rent Crisis outcomes\n\nNa\u00efve observers blame the corporate landlords for the rising prices and rents.\nAnd, so, now, at several levels of government, bills are being proposed to\nexclude these buyers from the market. If we can keep Wall Street money out of\nlocal housing markets, prices will go back down. This is true. Rents, then,\nwould continue to go up.\n\nThis is worrisome. This is the last round of the vicious cycle.\n\nLet\u2019s review our national devolution. In turns, we have restricted:\n\n  1. All housing in a few key metro areas.\n  2. Multi-family or infill housing in every major metro area.\n  3. Single-family mortgaged entry level homes in every major metro area. And now, potentially,\n  4. New single-family rental homes.\n\nThat is all the forms of housing, short of tents and underpasses. We are one\nstep away from legislating mass homelessness.\n\n## Policy Cycle 5: The Homeless Crisis (mislabeled the Drug and Mental Health\ncrisis)\n\nThe basic pattern will repeat, and in the cities with the worst housing\nconditions, we already have a preview of cycle 5.\n\n### Homeless Crisis\n\nWhere housing is in shortest supply, tent cities are accumulating in our parks\nand on our street corners. Of course, the residents that end up homeless\naren\u2019t middle managers and engineers. They are the most vulnerable residents.\nWhere homes are ample, mentally ill residents mostly have a home to sleep in.\nThe rate of homelessness across the US is correlated with low housing\nvacancies and high rents. It isn\u2019t correlated with mental illness or drug use.\n\n### Misunderstanding Homeless Crisis outcomes\n\nSince many homeless residents have personal problems, it seems obvious that\npersonal problems are the reason for their condition. And they frequently are!\nBut the reason a lack of housing is part of that poor condition is poor local\nhousing supply.\n\nThis is just one more case of mistaking the side effects for the cause. The\nalternate cause of every phase\u2019s problems has been logically unassailable. The\nClosed Access cities are popular. Loose lending can push up prices. There was\na building boom. It was followed by vacant units and a foreclosure crisis.\nCorporations do outbid families for homes and they have raised rents.\n\nWe can continue down the same path by blaming mental health and drugs for\nhomelessness. Bulldoze the tent encampments. Oppose the new housing support\ncenter because it\u2019s too dangerous to have those people living so near the\nneighborhood.\n\nEach of these steps has been a test of our liberal birthright. And we have\ncollectively failed, step after step, decade after decade.\n\nI tremble to imagine what Policy Cycle 6 will be.\n\n## Ending this\n\nIn addition to the cycles of failed housing policies, Americans have also\nsought to blame various sources of demand for costly housing: short-term\nrentals, wealthy foreigners, immigrants from the south, low interest rates. A\nconventional description of the Great Recession is that the housing bubble\nfooled Americans into thinking we were richer than we really were. You could\nsay that the Great Recession was our attempt to make ourselves poor enough to\nfit into our inadequate stock of housing. And it briefly succeeded. Maybe the\nmost popular idea of the past 20 years among the financial layperson is \u201cRaise\ninterest rates until the bubble pops.\u201d\n\nBefore 2008, even at the bottom of our deepest recessions, America never\nproduced fewer new homes per capita than we produce today. What does it say of\nAmerica if this is now too much housing demand for us to handle?\n\nIt clearly should not be. And to recognize that is to rediscover an optimism\nfor what we are capable of if we simply allow it.\n\nIlliberal assumptions have led to illiberal policy choices, which have led to\nilliberal conclusions, over and over again. Our very perceptions, our self-\nidentity as Americans, our mutual trust, are mired in a fog of confusion.\n\nHome prices in the Los Angeles metro area are at record highs. Yet, its\npopulation has declined by 3% since 2017. How high do interest rates need to\nrise? How much unemployment do we need to create? How many immigrants do we\nneed to deport? How many Airbnb\u2019s do we need to shut down? How many tents do\nwe need to bulldoze? How illiberal are we willing to be to push Los Angeles\u2019\npopulation down far enough to fit into its pitiful housing? Or will we choose,\nat this late date, to pay forward the growing, aspiring nation we inherited?\n\nFeatured image is Sparks, Nevada, by Ken Lund\n\n## Read more\n\n### How Movements Win\n\nOn the importance of a strong inside strategy.\n\nBy Samantha Hancox-Li Apr 9, 2024\n\n### An Arrow Against All Illiberals\n\nIan Dunt's How To Be a Liberal is a history of liberalism's conflicted nature\nand a call to arms for a dynamic, inclusive liberalism.\n\nBy Janet Bufton, Alan Elrod, Paul Crider Apr 8, 2024\n\n### A City of Liberalism Means Becoming a City of Yes\n\nImplementing YIMBY reforms in New York City.\n\nBy Nick Felker Mar 28, 2024\n\n### Magic Kingdom Authoritarianism\n\nTrump, Orb\u00e1n, revival, and the superficial strongman.\n\nBy Alan Elrod Mar 27, 2024\n\nPowered by Ghost\n\n## Liberal Currents\n\nLiberal Currents offers discussion, elucidation, and defense of liberal\nprinciples and institutions.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
