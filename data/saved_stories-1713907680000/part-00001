Some examples of public suffixes are .com,\n.co.uk and pvt.k12.ma.us. The Public Suffix List is a list of all known public\nsuffixes.\n\nThe Public Suffix List is an initiative of Mozilla, but is maintained as a\ncommunity resource. It is available for use in any software, but was\noriginally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers. It allows\nbrowsers to, for example:\n\n  * Avoid privacy-damaging \"supercookies\" being set for high-level domain name suffixes\n  * Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user interface\n  * Accurately sort history entries by site\n\nWe maintain a fuller (although not exhaustive) list of what people are using\nit for. If you are using it for something else, you are encouraged to tell us,\nbecause it helps us to assess the potential impact of changes. For that, you\ncan use the psl-discuss mailing list, where we consider issues related to the\nmaintenance, format and semantics of the list. Note: please do not use this\nmailing list to request amendments to the PSL's data.\n\nIt is in the interest of Internet registries to see that their section of the\nlist is up to date. If it is not, their customers may have trouble setting\ncookies, or data about their sites may display sub-optimally. So we encourage\nthem to maintain their section of the list by submitting amendments.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2007\u201322 Mozilla Foundation.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
