When I first started\ncoding, the thrill of solving problems and getting that hit of dopamine from\nthe instant feedback loop was incredible. It\u2019s easy to forget those initial\nchallenges and accomplishments as you progress, though, and problems that used\nto look like unscalable walls turn into speed bumps. That\u2019s why I believe\nregularly reflecting on your work is so valuable. Otherwise, you might find\nyourself dwelling on the struggles and forgetting the successes you\u2019ve\nachieved along the way.\n\n## Writing down the wins\n\nHere\u2019s how I track my progress: Every week or two, I set aside some time to\nquickly document my achievements, even small ones. I keep it concise to avoid\nprocrastination. I have some anxiety around tasks with too many unknowns, so a\nsimple, mechanical process works best for me. I\u2019m also a very forgetful\nperson, so I usually have to review artifacts created by the work that I do,\nlike following digital breadcrumbs that I leave around. Here\u2019s a list of where\nI might find these things:\n\n  * issues I\u2019ve worked on\n  * pull requests\n  * emails\n  * edits to documentation\n  * slack messages\n\nThe more concrete evidence, the better, but some achievements don\u2019t leave\nclear evidence so be sure to capture interesting anecdotes as they happen.\nAnything that has allowed me to progress forward should be highlighted, even\nif it is a result of compromise or realizing that you made a mistake.\n\nI also apply a similar strategy to my personal life. Did I stay on top of my\nDanish lessons and language learning apps? Did I have periods of being ill\nduring this period? Was I physically active, by cycling, exercising, or simply\ntaking the stairs? Tracking these things helps me see the broader picture.\n\n## Quarterly reviews\n\nTo pair with the weekly tracking. I conduct a more in-depth reflection every 3\nmonths. Here, I add my thoughts to these accomplishments. I create a narrative\nof the past quarter, encompassing both highs and lows, as well as the\ninevitable \u201cneutral\u201d experiences. Three months seems like a good timeframe to\nidentify any significant shifts in my attitude or goals. It allows me to\nassess my progress on past goals and set new ones for the future. I believe\nthis time frame is MUCH better than the yearly cycle of New Year resolutions.\nTwelve months is way too long. One month is usually not enough to make good\nprogress on goals or to establish habits. Three months seems just right to me.\nSo here\u2019s the list of what might appear on a quarterly review:\n\n  * A \u201cnarrative\u201d of the last three months using concrete examples from my journal to back it up.\n  * Report on the progress of previous goals.\n  * Create new goals or revise the older goals if needed.\n  * Pictures and video of important moments.\n  * Reflect on big family budget items and see if they align with my priorities in life.\n\n## Yearly themes\n\nYes, I am a Cortexan and podcast episodes outlining yearly themes are among my\nfavorites. Yearly themes give a framework for me to push myself to do things I\nwant to do while allowing me to adjust (every quarter) exactly what it means\nto accomplish my theme. Sometimes life throws additional challenges. For\nexample, it\u2019s silly to fail at achieving a goal of \u201crunning a mile every day\u201d\nif you break your leg.\n\nFor me, this year is \u201cThe Year of Building\u201d. Here\u2019s what I wrote about my\ntheme shortly before the year began:\n\n> I want to build some cool things. I want to make some useful open source\n> projects. I want to implement some neat solutions at work and actually prove\n> them out. My follow-through sometimes lacks when I lose interest in things.\n> I want to make more cool blog posts.\n>\n> I also want to build on my Danish by continuing my Danish classes, self\n> study with and using it more \u201cin the wild\u201d.\n\nI think I\u2019m doing a good job with this one. You may notice though that the\nlatest batch of blog posts didn\u2019t start in January. I \u201cslacked\u201d on this goal\nfor over a month but in my theme framework, it\u2019s fine because I was ramping up\nmy Danish classes again. My yearly theme allows me a lot of grace on the day-\nweek-month scale while hopefully keeping me honest on the yearly scale and\nallowing for adjustment of individual goals to match reality.\n\n## Try it yourself\n\nJournaling and goal-setting are extremely personal things so your process may\nvary a lot from mine. But one thing is likely true of everyone: by keeping\ntrack of your wins, both big and small, you can maintain motivation and see\nyour progress over time. Give it a try and see how it impacts your software\nengineering (and life) journey!\n\nDiscuss on Mastodon\n\nsudorandom @sudorandom@infosec.exchange\n\n\ud83d\udcdd New Post!
