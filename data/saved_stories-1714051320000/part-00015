Burgess said\nthose laws aren\u2019t working well because tech companies aren\u2019t helping.\n\n\u201cBut even when the warrant allows us to lawfully intercept an encrypted\ncommunication, we cannot actually read it without the assistance of the\ncompany that owns and operates the app,\u201d he said. \u201cThe company has to be\nwilling and able to give effect to our warrant.\u201d\n\nThe spy boss made it clear he doesn\u2019t want more powers, or an end to end-to-\nend encryption.\n\n\u201cI am asking the tech companies to do more. I\u2019m asking them to give effect to\nthe existing powers and to uphold existing laws,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWithout their help in very limited and strictly controlled circumstances,\nencryption is unaccountable,\u201d Burgess argued. \u201cIn effect, unaccountable\nencryption is like building a safe room for terrorists and spies, a secure\nplace where they can plot and plan.\u201d\n\nHe argued the case for \u201caccountable encryption\u201d by telling the story of a\nrecent operation involving an Australian who shared extremist content online\nand was suspected of having contacted terrorists to discuss plans for a\nviolent act. Burgess said that after a \u201cdifficult, dangerous, time-consuming\nand resource-intensive\u201d operation that involved \u201csurveillance, human\nintelligence and other capabilities,\u201d ASIO determined the individual\n\u201cpossessed the intent and capability to conduct an attack.\u201d\n\nThe spy boss argued that accountable encryption would have meant ASIO could\nmore quickly and easily reached that conclusion.\n\n\u201cQuick and targeted access to his communications could have been the\ndifference between life and death,\u201d Burgess argued.\n\n  * Australia secures takedown order for terror videos, which Elon Musk wants to fight\n  * Australian techie jailed for accessing museum's accounting system and buying himself stuff\n  * New Zealand to world: China attacked us, too!\n  * Meta kills Facebook News in the US and Australia\n\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP) commissioner Reece Kershaw spoke next and\ncited the April 21 statement made by 32 European police chiefs in which they\nexpressed \u201cdeep concern that end-to-end encryption is being rolled out in a\nway that undermines their ability to investigate crime and keep the public\nsafe.\u201d\n\nKershaw backed that sentiment and, like his European colleagues, framed it in\nthe context of investigations into child exploitation.\n\n\u201cIf a judicial officer decides there is reasonable suspicion that a serious\ncrime has been committed, and it is necessary for law enforcement to access\ninformation to investigate that serious crime, tech companies should respect\nthe rule of law and the order of a court, or independent judicial authority,\nand provide that information,\u201d Kershaw said.\n\n\u201cMy door is open to all relevant tech CEOs and chairmen, including Elon Musk\nand Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d the police boss said. \u201cI know we can find common ground\nbecause, put simply, tech is supposed to make our lives easier and safer, and\nnot the opposite.\u201d\n\nOr maybe that common ground will be hard to find given that Elon Musk is\ncurrently arguing against an Australian law that requires the takedown of a\nvideo depicting an act of terror. Several associates of the alleged offender\ndepicted in that video were arrested on Wednesday as it was felt they share a\nviolent ideology and therefore represent an unacceptable risk to the\nAustralian community.\n\n### The Phantom Menace\n\nASIO boss Burgess also discussed AI, a technology he said is \u201c equal parts\nhype, opportunity, and threat\u201d\n\n\u201cHype because there\u2019s a yawning chasm between current reality and what\u2019s being\nclaimed by tech-evangelists and marketing gurus. A lot of what they call AI\nisn\u2019t,\u201d Burgess said, before predicting AI presents an opportunity to \u201cdeliver\ndividends to every part of society, from the economy to health care.\u201d\n\nBut he lamented that AI can also improve the productivity of \u201cthose who could\nuse it to threaten Australia\u2019s security\u201d and said some nasty people are\nalready using AI for evil.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of offshore extremists already asking a commercially available\nAI program for advice on building weapons and attack planning,\u201d Burgess said.\n\u201cIf the programs refuse to provide the requested information, the extremists\ntry to bypass the ethical handbrakes.\u201d\n\nBurgess also predicted \u201cAI is likely to make radicalization easier and\nfaster\u201d, and \u201cwill increase the volume of espionage\u201d as it gives nation-states\na good reason \u201cto harvest personal data to assist their own programming and\nmore motivated to steal information about rival AI technologies.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also braced for \u201cmore prolific, more credible and more effective\ndisinformation campaigns\u201d conducted by foreign intelligence services.\n\nASIO, he said, will fight AI with AI, because that\u2019s \u201cthe most obvious and\npossibly best defense.\u201d Burgess confirmed \u201cASIO\u2019s been using artificial\nintelligence for a number of years now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not replacing our people \u2013 it is augmenting and assisting them,\u201d he\nsaid, by making it easier for ASIO staff to sift information.\n\n\u201cFinding a critical piece of intelligence is less like looking for a needle in\na haystack than looking for a needle in a field of haystacks,\u201d he said. \u201cAI\nmakes that process easier and faster; it can identify worrying patterns and\nrelationships in minutes and hours rather than weeks and months.\u201d\n\nBut only if the data it\u2019s working on isn\u2019t encrypted. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Australia\n  * Encryption\n  * Law\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Australia\n  * Encryption\n  * Law\n  * Security\n  * Social Media\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * Advanced persistent threat\n  * Antitrust\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Authentication\n  * BEC\n  * Black Hat\n  * BSides\n  * Bug Bounty\n  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n  * Cross-border data flow\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  * Data Breach\n  * Data Protection\n  * Data Theft\n  * DDoS\n  * DEF CON\n  * Digital certificate\n  * Digital Services Act\n  * Exploit\n  * Firewall\n  * Five Eyes\n  * Hacker\n  * Hacking\n  * Hacktivism\n  * Identity Theft\n  * Incident response\n  * Infosec\n  * Kenna Security\n  * Let's Encrypt\n  * NCSAM\n  * NCSC\n  * Palo Alto Networks\n  * Password\n  * Phishing\n  * Privacy Shield\n  * Quantum key distribution\n  * Ransomware\n  * Remote Access Trojan\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Signal\n  * Social Network\n  * Spamming\n  * Spyware\n  * Square Kilometre Array\n  * Surveillance\n  * TLS\n  * Trojan\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * Vulnerability\n  * Wannacry\n  * Zero trust\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Australia\n  * Encryption\n  * Law\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Australia\n  * Encryption\n  * Law\n  * Security\n  * Social Media\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * Advanced persistent threat\n  * Antitrust\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Authentication\n  * BEC\n  * Black Hat\n  * BSides\n  * Bug Bounty\n  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n  * Cross-border data flow\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n  * Data Breach\n  * Data Protection\n  * Data Theft\n  * DDoS\n  * DEF CON\n  * Digital certificate\n  * Digital Services Act\n  * Exploit\n  * Firewall\n  * Five Eyes\n  * Hacker\n  * Hacking\n  * Hacktivism\n  * Identity Theft\n  * Incident response\n  * Infosec\n  * Kenna Security\n  * Let's Encrypt\n  * NCSAM\n  * NCSC\n  * Palo Alto Networks\n  * Password\n  * Phishing\n  * Privacy Shield\n  * Quantum key distribution\n  * Ransomware\n  * Remote Access Trojan\n  * REvil\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Signal\n  * Social Network\n  * Spamming\n  * Spyware\n  * Square Kilometre Array\n  * Surveillance\n  * TLS\n  * Trojan\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * Vulnerability\n  * Wannacry\n  * Zero trust\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Australia secures takedown order for terror videos, which Elon Musk wants\nto fight\n\n+Comment Yet X remains a supporter of The Christchurch Call, an international\nagreement to stop video nasties\n\nPersonal Tech2 days | 59\n\n#### Europol now latest cops to beg Big Tech to ditch E2EE\n\nDon't bore us, get to the chorus: You need less privacy so we can protect the\nchildren\n\nSecurity3 days | 25\n\n#### Senate passes law forcing ByteDance to sell off TikTok \u2013 or face a US ban\n\nUpdated Somewhere in Beijing, someone's screaming: Mother, PFACAA!\n\nPersonal Tech1 day | 62\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Governments issue alerts after 'sophisticated' state-backed actor found\nexploiting flaws in Cisco security boxes\n\nDon't get too comfortable: 'Line Dancer' malware may be targeting other\nvendors, too\n\nSecurity5 hrs | 2\n\n#### Elon Musk's X to challenge Australian content takedown orders in court\n\nAsia In Brief PLUS: Samsung in 'emergency mode';
