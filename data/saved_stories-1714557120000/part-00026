Absolutely agree with getting folks involved in taking\nownership of them. Go team!\n\n> If anything is missing from dependencies, please feel free to add them.\n\nOk yeah this was my main concern. I knew for sure there is router stuff which\nis why I started there with the labels, but I think there is more in the other\nfew. So if anyone wants to take point on reviewing the deps we own which are\n\"direct deps\" of express that would be awesome. Specifically I think each repo\nneeds to address if there are any pending breaking changes which look like\nthey were ready to land (if they are too contentious or too incomplete then we\nshould not land them now) or if there is a pre-existing major version branch\nwith work left to do on it (which is the case in a few for sure). For that we\nneed to catalog that work here so we make sure we don't miss anything.  \n---  \n  \nMember Author\n\n###\n\nUlisesGascon commented Apr 28, 2024\n\n> Can I do the \"Add the blog one\" @UlisesGascon?\n\nI think that @chrisdel101 is actively working on it, maybe we can provide them\nmore support.Aside of active development for sure you (@CBID2 @mertcanaltin)\ncan work on:\n\n  * Reviewing the PR(s) for the new blog\n  * Start to work on the blog entries content (see: Ideas for blog content expressjs.com#1500)\n\n> Add support for Node@22 in the CI (no leader), would like to work with this\n> topic.\n\nI think that maybe @rxmarbles is working on it, based on slack comment  \n---  \n  \nMember\n\n###\n\nwesleytodd commented Apr 29, 2024\n\n> Active dev branch for v5 is 5.x, correct? As opposed to 5.0 which would be a\n> release branch?\n\nYeah exactly. That said I have gotten confused a few times and I think this is\none case where we would benefit from automation and some really clear and\nsimple docs.  \n---  \n  \nSign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.
