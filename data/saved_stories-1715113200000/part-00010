Physicists detect the first \u201cglueball\u201d\n\nGlueballs are an unusual, unconfirmed Standard Model prediction, suggesting\nbound states of gluons alone exist. We just found our first one.\n\nA view from above of the BES III detector at the electron-positron collider in\nBeijing, China. Exotic particles have newly been detected here, including X,\nY, and Z mesons which don't fit the normal scheme of a quark-antiquark\ncombination. With the X(2370) particle, we may have detected the first\nglueball in history.\n\nCredit: Institute for High Energy Physics, Beijing\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  * At a fundamental level, the matter we know of is largely composed of quarks, like the up and down quarks, which make up protons and neutrons: the particles at the heart of every atom\u2019s core.\n  * Quarks and gluons, operating under the strong force and the rules of quantum chromodynamics, make up all the known hadrons, baryons, and mesons in existence, providing us with a huge spectrum of particle states.\n  * But, in theory, there should be another kind of bound state never observed before: glueballs, which are quarkless composite particles made of bound gluons alone. At last, in 2024, we may have found our first one.\n\nEthan Siegel\n\nShare New particle at last! Physicists detect the first \u201cglueball\u201d on Facebook\n\nShare New particle at last!

Physicists detect the first \u201cglueball\u201d on LinkedIn\n\nWhen it comes to the Standard Model of particle physics, most people\nincorrectly assume that it\u2019s known, it\u2019s correct, and that there are no more\nopen questions about its validity. While the Standard Model has certainly\nwithstood every challenge that\u2019s been thrown at it by way of direct detection\nexperiments, there are still a whole slew of questions that have yet to be\nanswered. Although the matter that makes us up is composed of atoms, which are\nmade of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and where the protons and neutrons\nare made up of three quarks apiece \u2014 all held together by gluons through the\nstrong interaction \u2014 that\u2019s not the only possible way to have bound states of\nmatter.\n\nIn theory, at least according to quantum chromodynamics (our theory of the\nstrong nuclear force), there should be multiple ways to make a bound state of\nquarks, antiquarks, and/or gluons alone.\n\n  * You can have baryons (with 3 quarks each) or anti-baryons (with 3 antiquarks each).\n  * You can have mesons (with a quark-antiquark pair).\n  * You can have exotic states like tetraquarks (2 quarks and 2 antiquarks), pentaquarks (4 quarks and 1 antiquark or 1 quark and 4 antiquarks), or hexaquarks (6 quarks, 3 quarks and 3 antiquarks, or 6 antiquarks), etc.\n  * Or, you can also have states made of gluons alone \u2014 with no valence quarks or antiquarks \u2014 known a glueballs.\n\nIn a radical new paper just published in the journal Physical Review Letters,\nthe BES III collaboration just announced that an exotic particle, previously\nidentified as the X(2370), may indeed be the lightest glueball predicted by\nthe Standard Model. Here\u2019s the science of the claim, as well as what it all\nmeans.\n\nBubble chamber tracks from Fermilab, revealing the charge, mass, energy, and\nmomentum of the particles and antiparticles created. Although we can\nreconstruct what happened at the collision point for any one event, we need\nlarge numbers of statistics to build up sufficient evidence to claim the\nexistence of any new particle species.\n\nCredit: Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory / DOE / NSF\n\nIf you want to find a particle in the world of high-energy physics, it isn\u2019t\nenough to simply create that particle in the lab and build a detector around\nit, viewing the decay products and determining what occurred back at the point\nof that particle\u2019s creation. The problem with that approach is that, in a\nquantum Universe, there\u2019s rarely a single definitive outcome that you can\npredict based on a set of given initial conditions. Instead, you can only\npredict the probabilities of a wide variety of outcomes that are expected to\noccur, and then you require many repeated observations to determine whether\nyour theoretical predictions align with or conflict with what you observe.\n\nThis becomes especially important when you\u2019re looking for something that\nshould exist or occur within the Standard Model, but only under infrequent,\npossibly special conditions or circumstances. Every unstable particle \u2014 both\nfundamental and composite \u2014 has a set of decays that it\u2019s allowed to\nexperience, and a frequency for each decay pathway that\u2019s also predicted:\nknown as its branching ratios. While we normally think of particle creation as\noccurring only if you have enough energy to make it from energy, via\nEinstein\u2019s famous E = mc2, the reality is that many composite particles can\nonly be detected from the signatures left when other known particles are\ncreated in great numbers, and then decay away.\n\nThe particles and antiparticles of the Standard Model have now all been\ndirectly detected, with the last holdout, the Higgs boson, falling at the LHC\nin 2012. Today, only the gluons and photons are massless; everything else has\na non-zero rest mass. Only the quarks and gluons couple to the strong force,\nand experience QCD interactions.\n\nCredit: E. Siegel/Beyond the Galaxy\n\nDuring the 20th century, various pieces of the Standard Model came together.\nWe discovered that atoms were composed of nuclei and electrons, and then that\nthe atomic nuclei themselves were made of still smaller particles: protons and\nneutrons, which were further divisible into quarks and gluons. It was soon\ndetermined that there weren\u2019t just two types of quarks \u2014 the up and down\nflavors \u2014 but heavier, exotic, short-lived types as well.\n\n  * The first particle to contain a strange quark, the kaon, was discovered in 1947, but the explanation for it (including the existence of the strange quark) was only found in 1964.\n  * The first discovery of the charm quark came in 1974, when a particle known as the J/\u03c8 was discovered by two independent teams: Samuel Ting\u2019s team at Brookhaven (who named it \u201cJ\u201d after himself, as the Chinese character for Ting is \u4e01) and Burton Richter\u2019s team at SLAC (who named it \u201c\u03c8\u201d consistent with other conventions in particle physics).\n  * The bottom quark was discovered soon thereafter in 1977, and the sixth and final quark predicted by the Standard Model, the top quark, was revealed in 1995.\n\nAll particles that are composed of any of these heavier, exotic quarks (or\nantiquarks) are fundamentally unstable, and must not only decay, but decay\nthrough the weak interactions in order to change the species of the\nconstituent quarks inside. All particles containing a strange, charm, bottom,\nor top quark cannot remain stable for long; in a tiny fraction of a second,\nthey decay and change species, transitioning back into lower-energy, lighter,\nmore stable particles in the process.\n\nWhen the neutral kaon (containing a strange quark) decays, it typically\nresults in the net production of either two or three pions. Supercomputer\nsimulations are required to understand whether the level of CP-violation,\nfirst observed in these decays, agrees or disagrees with the Standard Model\u2019s\npredictions. With the exception of only a few particles and particle\ncombinations, almost every set of particles in the Universe are unstable, and\nif they don\u2019t annihilate away, they will decay in short order.\n\nCredit: Brookhaven National Laboratory\n\nThere are also rules that must be followed in order for any sort of composite\nparticle to exist: the full suite of the quantum rules that govern the\nUniverse.\n\n  * Energy must be conserved, meaning that if you wish to create a particle initially, you must have enough available energy (via Einstein\u2019s E = mc2) for that particle to be able to be created.\n  * Electric charge, angular momentum, linear momentum, and other quantum properties must also be conserved: you can only create particles (or particle-antiparticle pairs) that don\u2019t violate these conservation laws.\n  * Rules about spin, or the inherent angular momentum of these particles, must be obeyed, including as respects the decay pathways of parent particles into daughter particles.\n  * And if you have any quark-and-gluon containing entity, which are the only particles that experience the strong nuclear force, you can only create a \u201ccolorless\u201d combination of these particles, even for an instant, if you want them to exist.\n\nThe rules about the strong nuclear force and color are a little bit more\ncomplicated than theories with only one type of charge (positive and\nattractive, like gravity) or two types of charge (positive and negative, where\nlike charges repel and opposite charges attract, like electromagnetism), and\ninvolve three fundamental types of charge \u2014 color charge \u2014 that are all\ninterrelated. While every quark has a color, every antiquark has an anticolor,\nand every gluon carries a color-anticolor combination, the bound states that\nexist must all be truly colorless.\n\nCombinations of three quarks (RGB) or three antiquarks (CMY) are colorless, as\nare appropriate combinations of quark/antiquark pairs. The gluon exchanges\nthat keep these entities stable are quite complicated, but require eight, not\nnine, gluons. Particles with a net color charge are forbidden under the strong\ninteractions.\n\nCredit: Maschen/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThis leaves us, perhaps surprisingly to some, with an enormous number of\npossible combinations for creating colorless bound states.\n\n  * You can have a color-anticolor combination, like a quark-antiquark pair, to make a meson.\n  * You can have a color-color-color or anticolor-anticolor-anticolor combination, such as three quarks or three antiquarks, to make either a baryon or an anti-baryon.\n  * You can have multiple combinations of either or both of the two above options to still maintain a colorless state; so long as there are equal numbers of \u201ccolored\u201d and \u201canticolored\u201d particles, or that there\u2019s an excess of one type over the other in multiples of three, you can have a colorless entity, including tetraquarks, pentaquarks, hexaquarks, or greater numbers or quarks.\n  * Or you can have something that\u2019s made exclusively of gluons \u2014 the particles that carry a color-anticolor combination inherently \u2014 with no quarks or antiquarks at all, save for the ones that arise internally as a consequence of the gluon field.\n\nThat last possibility is rarely discussed in particle physics, because the\nresultant entity \u2014 a glueball \u2014 had not only never been detected, but\ncalculating the expected properties of glueballs was too daunting of a task\nfor 20th century physicists.\n\nToday, Feynman diagrams are used in calculating every fundamental interaction\nspanning the weak and electromagnetic forces, including in high-energy and\nlow-temperature/condensed conditions. Including higher-order \u201cloop\u201d diagrams\nleads to more refined, more accurate approximations of the true value to\nquantities in our Universe. However, the strong interactions cannot be\ncomputed in this fashion, and must either be subject to non-perturbative\ncomputer calculations (Lattice QCD) or require experimental inputs (the\nR-ratio method) in order to account for their contributions.\n\nCredit: V. S. de Carvalho and H. Freire, Nucl. Phys. B, 2013\n\nBut here in the 21st century, we can do those calculations. The difference is\nthat, in the 20th century, the only reliable technique we had for calculating\nthe properties of quantum systems was perturbatively: where you calculate\nprogressively more and more complex interaction terms to get progressively\nmore and more accurate answers. This approach, which was so successful for\nquantum electrodynamics (where the interaction strength gets smaller at\ngreater distances and has a small coupling constant at low energies), fails\nspectacularly for quantum chromodynamics, as the strong force gets greater as\ndistances increase and its coupling constant is large.\n\nHowever, a new technique came along with the advent of high-performance\ncomputing: the technique of Lattice QCD. By treating spacetime as a discrete\ngrid with a very small inherent spacing, we can make predictions for larger-\nscale phenomena: the confinement of QCD bound states, the conditions under\nwhich a quark-gluon plasma should arise, and even a prediction for the masses\nof various bound states, including not only the proton and neutron, but heavy\nand exotic bound states as well. In other words, whereas we couldn\u2019t calculate\nthe full suite of the expected properties of tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and\nglueballs back in the 1990s, those are calculation we can perform \u2014 down to\nprecisions with only a few percent uncertainty \u2014 here in the 2020s.\n\nGluons aren\u2019t simply the particles that bind quarks together; they may also be\nparticles that bind themselves together into a quarkless glob known as a\nglueball. The lightest glueball state may be able to be revealed from the\ndecays of particles created in electron-positron colliders.\n\nCredit: University of Glasgow/BNL\n\nTheoretically, these predictions now include one for the lightest glueball\nstate: it should be a pseudoscalar, with total spin 0, no electric charge, and\nwith odd parity, and with a rest mass of between 2.3 and 2.6 GeV/c2. If you\nwant to try and create this glueball state experimentally, your best bet is to\ncreate a composite particle whose mass is slightly greater than this value,\nbut whose decay produces lots of gluons and hadrons: an ideal place for\nsearching for glueballs. Because of how easy it is to produce it with modern\ntechnology, and because it has precisely these properties, decays of the J/\u03c8\nparticle is generally regarded as a great place to look for these potential\nglueball states.\n\nWhenever a J/\u03c8 particle is created, there\u2019s about a 26% chance that it will\ndecay into a photon (which can then decay into either quark-containing\nparticles or lepton-antilepton pairs), about a 64% chance it will decay into\nthree gluons, and about a 9% chance it will decay into a photon and two\ngluons. Even though most of the decays are mundane and well-understood, a\nsmall contribution from the lightest glueball could contribute to some of\nthese decay channels. In particular, if a J/\u03c8 particle decays into:\n\n  * a photon,\n  * an \u03b7\u2032 particle,\n  * and either a pair of kaons or a pair of pions,\n\na resonance of the \u03b7\u2032 with the kaon/pion pair could appear in the data if it\ncorresponds to the lightest glueball state.\n\nThe BES III Experiment at the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider 2 in China\ncollides electrons and positrons at energies between 2 and 4.7 GeV to create a\nvariety of known and previously unknown particles, including exotic QCD\nstates. The discovery of multiple tetraquark states has already come from this\ncollaboration, and the X(2370) now emerges as an exciting candidate for a\npossible glueball particle.\n\nCredit: BES III collaboration\n\nThe greatest \u201cfactory\u201d ever constructed for investigating the J/\u03c8 particle is\nlocated in Beijing at their electron-positron collider, known as the Beijing\nSpectrometer III (BES III), which began taking data in its modern form in\n2008. In its first year, alone, BES III accumulated some 226 million events\nthat created J/\u03c8 particles, and as of the end of 2023, that cumulative number\nnow exceeds 10 billion J/\u03c8 particles. Therefore, even rare events and\nresonances that emerge from these decays can now be probed. A few exotic\nstates have been discovered as well: a class of particles known as XYZ mesons,\nwhich are now known to include exotic states such as tetraquarks.\n\nAll told, with the data collected at BES III, they can announce definitive\nevidence for a new composite particle known as the X(2370), with:\n\n  * a mass of 2.395 GeV/c2,\n  * a spin of 0,\n  * a branching fraction of approximately 0.000013 [meaning that about 1 out of every 76,000 J/\u03c8 particles will decay into something that includes an X(2370)],\n  * and that appears with a cumulative statistical significance of a whopping 11.7-\u03c3.\n\nIn particle physics, a result that appears with more than 5-\u03c3 significance has\njust a 0.00006% chance of being a statistical fluke, and any result more\nsignificant than that has surpassed the \u201cgold standard\u201d for announcing a bona\nfide discovery.\n\nOriginally, the only hadrons known to exist were either combinations of three\nquarks (baryons), three antiquarks (anti-baryons), and quark-antiquark pairs\n(mesons). Now, more exotic states such as tetraquarks, including the Z_c(3900)\nshown here, are known to exist as well. Glueballs, pentaquarks, and other\nexotics remain tantalizing and expected possibilities as well.\n\nCredit: APS/Alan Stonebraker\n\nAlthough the particle was first announced as being at 2.370 GeV/c2, which is\nwhy it\u2019s known as the X(2370), the latest experimental results indicate that\nits mass is more accurately 2.395 GeV/c2, with an experimental uncertainty of\n0.011 GeV/c2 attached to it. Meanwhile, the latest theoretical results from\nLattice QCD, published in 2019, predicted a mass of 2.395 \u00b1 0.014 GeV/c2,\nwhich shows a spectacular agreement between experiment and theory. This\nparticle, the X(2370), exists, and is having its properties measured better\nthan ever before, with this latest study being the first to measure the\nquantum numbers of its spin and parity.\n\nWhile all of it is consistent with this particle being the first glueball ever\ndetected, however, there are still reasons to be cautious. For one, other\nX-mesons have been discovered, and are mere resonances involving combinations\nof quarks-and-antiquarks rather than glueballs. For another, the production\nrate of the X(2370) observed from J/\u03c8 decays is a bit too high to be\nconsistent with the glueball interpretation, although that interpretation is\nstill being reviewed. And finally, the negative parity measured for X(2370) is\nconsistent with this being a pseudoscalar instead of a scalar, but this only\nestablishes a consistency with the glueball interpretation: not a smoking gun\nsignal that it is indeed a glueball in its nature.\n\nThe J/\u03c8 system can decay to a photon and two gluons, where the two gluons can\nthen combine to temporarily create an X(2370) exotic particle. Although its\nnature is still not 100% certain, the interpretation of the X(2370) as a\nglueball remains compelling, and if so, it would be the first glueball\nparticle ever revealed by experiment.\n\nCredit: Physical Review Letters/Twitter\n\nThe big question at the core of this study is whether glueballs exist or not,\nas the Standard Model and the theory of QCD predict that they must, and\nwhether the observations of the X(2370) are sufficient to establish it as a\nglueball state itself. These latest results \u2014 the strongest and most robust in\nhistory \u2014 support the interpretation of the X(2370) as a potential glueball\nstate, and bring us one step closer to putting this key aspect of the Standard\nModel to a critical test. However, until questions about its production rate\nand branching ratios can be sufficiently answered, we have to remain open-\nminded to the fact that this could be just another \u201cexotic\u201d state, like a\ntetraquark, that isn\u2019t composed solely of gluons.\n\nNevertheless, with the production of many hundreds of thousands of X(2370)\nparticles as the result of the decay of more than 10 billion J/\u03c8 particles, we\nhave now solidly measured more properties than ever of this exotic particle.\nIt is now the most compelling, interesting candidate for a glueball: a species\nof composite particle that should exist, but that has never been seen before.\nMore work still needs to be done to determine the full nature of the X(2370)\nparticle, but this is the strongest evidence for the existence of a glueball\never put forth into the world. If no glueballs exist in all of nature, then\nsomething new is wrong with the Standard Model. If glueballs do exist,\nhowever, the X(2370) just might be the first one revealed to humanity.\n\nTags\n\nparticle physics\n\nIn this article\n\nparticle physics\n\nRelated\n\nStarts With A Bang\n\nWhy does our Universe have 8 types of gluon?\n\nProtons and neutrons are held together by the strong force: with 3 colors and\n3 anticolors.
