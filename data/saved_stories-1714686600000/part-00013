The project is known as the International Lunar\nResearch Station (ILRS) and was jointly announced in 2021 by China and Russia.\n\nChina is now leading the moon base initiative and attempting to attract\ninternational partners for the endeavor. So far, alongside China, Russia,\nVenezuela, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, South Africa, Egypt, Thailand and\nNicaragua have joined the initiative, according to Space News.\n\nRelated: Not just Artemis: China and Russia plan to put boots on the moon, too\n\nA still from a video released by the China National Space Administration\n(CNSA) that outlines its concept for a lunar base to be developed across the\nnext couple of decades.

These\ncorrespond to the planned Chang'e-6 and 7 missions planned for launch next\nmonth and in 2027 respectively.\n\nTogether with Chang'e-8, these will form a basic model of the ILRS by around\n2028. Next will come communications, power generation and other\ninfrastructure, which will be built on and developed into an expansive,\ninhabited lunar outpost.\n\nThe project is envisioned as a comprehensive scientific experimental base\nwhich will host interdisciplinary and multi-objective research activities\nfocusing on lunar exploration and utilization, according to Chinese reports.\nIt will be capable of long-term independent operation, either on the lunar\nsurface or in lunar orbit.\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nA still from a video released by the China National Space Administration\n(CNSA) that outlines its concept for a lunar base to be developed across the\nnext couple of decades.

It\nwill serve as a technological, material, and intellectual reservoir, preparing\nus for future missions to Mars and other distant destinations in space,\" Wu\nWeiren, chief designer of China's lunar exploration program, told China\nCentral Television (CCTV) on Wednesday.\n\nWu says the ILRS will be constructed in two phases. The first will establish\ncomprehensive scientific facilities with basic functions and essential\nsupporting elements around the lunar south pole by 2035. The second phase will\nset about building a well-equipped and stable facility of considerable scale\nby 2045.\n\nOne curious detail of the video is the presence of a retired NASA Space\nShuttle appearing to lift off from a launch pad in the background.\n\n> Boom problem solved.
