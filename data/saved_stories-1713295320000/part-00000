This returns at most\n25 HN submissions that should have a pretty intellectually stimulating\ndiscussion.\n\nI built this tool to help me find interesting discussions on Hacker News. I\nlove reading HN discussion almost more than the articles themselves. However,\nI found that full text search, although highly performant, is not always good\nat surfacing interesting discussions on a certain topic.\n\nBriefly, this works by...\n\n* Doing full-text search on short queries of up to three words, taking the average vector embedding of the first 1024 results returned, and then finding 25 stories with an average comment embedding close to the query.\n* Getting the text embedding for queries with more than three words (or queries with emoji) and then using that directly to find 25 stories of interest.\n\nThis deserves a more thorough writeup, and a picture is probably worth a\nthousand words here...\n\nLoading...\n\n", "frontpage": true}
