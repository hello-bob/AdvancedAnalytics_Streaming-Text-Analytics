It was a disturbing\nforecast, and everybody paid attention.\n\nPeople saw his book Future Shock everywhere. I was just a freshman in high\nschool, but even I bought a copy (the purple version). And clearly I wasn\u2019t\nalone\u2014Clark Drugstore in my hometown had them piled high in the front of the\nstore.\n\nThe book sold at least six million copies and maybe a lot more (Toffler\u2019s\nwebsite claims 15 million). It was reviewed, translated, and discussed\nendlessly. Future Shock turned Toffler\u2014previously a freelance writer with an\nEnglish degree from NYU\u2014into a tech guru applauded by a devoted global\naudience.\n\nToffler showed up on the couch next to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show.\nOther talk show hosts (Dick Cavett, Mike Douglas, etc.) invited him to their\ncouches too. CBS featured Toffler alongside Arthur C. Clarke and Buckminster\nFuller as trusted guides to the future. Playboy magazine gave him a thousand\ndollar award just for being so smart.\n\nToffler parlayed this pop culture stardom into a wide range of follow-up\nprojects and businesses, from consulting to professorships. When he died in\n2016, at age 87, obituaries praised Alvin Toffler as \u201cthe most influential\nfuturist of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nBut did he deserve this notoriety and praise?\n\n####\n\nThe Honest Broker is a reader-supported guide to music, books, media &\nculture. Both free and paid subscriptions are available. If you want to\nsupport my work, the best way is by taking out a paid subscription.\n\nFuture Shock is a 500 page book, but the premise is simple: Things are\nchanging too damn fast.\n\nToffler opens an early chapter by telling the story of Ricky Gallant, a\nyoungster in Eastern Canada who died of old age at just eleven. He was only a\nkid, but already suffered from \u201csenility, hardened arteries, baldness, slack,\nand wrinkled skin. In effect, Ricky was an old man when he died.\u201d\n\nToffler didn\u2019t actually say that this was going to happen to all of us. But\nI\u2019m sure more than a few readers of Future Shock ran to the mirror, trying to\nassess the tech-driven damage in their own faces.\n\n\u201cThe future invades our lives,\u201d he claims on page one. Our bodies and minds\ncan\u2019t cope with this. Future shock is a \u201creal sickness,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt is\nthe disease of change.\u201d\n\nAs if to prove this, Toffler\u2019s publisher released the paperback edition of\nFuture Shock with six different covers\u2014each one a different color. The concept\nwas brilliant. Not only did Future Shock say that things were constantly\nchanging, but every time you saw somebody reading it, the book itself had\nchanged.\n\nOf course, if you really believed Future Shock was a disease, why would you\naggravate it with a stunt like this? But nobody asked questions like that.\nMaybe they were too busy looking in the mirror for \u201cbaldness, slack, and\nwrinkled skin.\u201d\n\nToffler worried about all kinds of change, but technological change was the\nmain focus of his musings. When the New York Times reviewed his book, it\nannounced in the opening sentence that \u201cTechnology is both hero and villain of\nFuture Shock.\u201d\n\nDuring his brief stint at Fortune magazine, Toffler often wrote about tech,\nand warned about \u201cinformation overload.\u201d The implication was that human beings\nare a kind of data storage medium\u2014and they\u2019re running out of disk space.\n\nAlvin Toffler\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that Toffler invented either of those terms\u2014\u201cfuture shock\u201d or\n\u201cinformation overload.\u201d Back in 1963, the former phrase had shown up in a talk\ndelivered to a group of educators by Charles Weingartner and Neil Postman.\nThey defined \u201cfuture shock\u201d as the \u201csocial paralysis induced by rapid\ntechnological change.\u201d Two years later, Toffler published an article in\nHorizon magazine entitled \u201cThe Future as a Way of Life,\u201d which showcased some\nof the key points.\n\nHere Toffler announced the arrival of this new affliction. Future shock was\nthe inevitable result of a \u201csecond industrial revolution\u201d sweeping the world.\n\u201cBut it was \u201cbigger, deeper, and more important\u201d than the previous industrial\nrevolution. Here, too, he looks at technology as a threat.\n\nToffler points out that there were now 15,000 academic journals, publishing\nmaybe a \u201cmillion significant papers in them each year.\u201d Who could keep up with\nall this progress? (Of course, that assumes that the contents of 15,000\nacademic journals represent progress\u2014but that\u2019s a different discussion.)\n\nI find it curious that Toffler spoke so much about technological change, and\nso little about sociological change. When he published Future Shock in 1970,\nthe US had just experienced a tumultuous decade, but the disruptions weren\u2019t\ncoming from machines. The real sources of shock were the people themselves,\nthe masses were unleashed.\n\n> ### Instead of Future Shock, Toffler should have written a book called\n> Future Numbness or Future Couch Potato. That would have hit the mark with a\n> bullseye.\n\nThe real forces of change in that era were the sexual revolution, liberation\nfrom censorship, the rise of alternative lifestyles, vocal protests, and the\noverturning of inherited values of all sorts. But Toffler looked for\ndisruptive change elsewhere, and pointed at \u201cair travel and space flight,\ntelevision, the development of nuclear energy, the invention of the computer,\nthe discovery of DNA with its possibilities for the control of evolution,\u201d and\nother trends of that sort.\n\nYou might think that Toffler, writing in 1965, would focus on the\nassassination of the President or the Civil Rights movement. But instead he\ndevotes more attention to attempts to detect radio signals from Jupiter.\n\nBut does the existence of space travel really put us in a state of shock? Is\nair travel a danger to our psyches and organisms?\n\nAnd what about television? I have a friend who can\u2019t fall asleep unless the TV\nis on in his bedroom. To my mind, that provides a much better metaphor for\nconsumer technology. It doesn\u2019t shock us\u2014not at all.\n\nIt numbs us.\n\nAs I look back on Future Shock with the benefit of 50 years of hindsight, I\nsee this everywhere in his book. Things turned out the exact opposite of what\nToffler anticipated. Instead of Future Shock, he should have written a book\ncalled Future Numbness or Future Couch Potato. That would have hit the mark\nwith a bullseye.\n\nPeople today aren\u2019t put into shock by all their tech devices. They are numbed\nand hypnotized. They\u2019re addicted and won\u2019t put them down. These folks haven\u2019t\nbeen invaded by the future. If these machines are the future, they can\u2019t get\nenough of it.\n\nIt\u2019s the past that people have lost. They don\u2019t care about it. They don\u2019t\nunderstand it. They don\u2019t want to understand it.\n\nWe live in cities that embody thousands of years of human labor, ingenuity,\nand imagination. Perhaps this might be shocking and anxiety-provoking if\npeople thought about it\u2014and especially if they focused on how fragile all this\nis. History tells of other cultures that created amazing technologies and then\ncollapsed. Thinking about that might actually cause some real shock.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how the dominant mindset right now views city life or digital\ndevices\u2014or any other legacy of the past. The reality is that people don\u2019t\nthink about much of anything at all, because technology turns them into\npassive receptors.\n\nNobody is \u201cinvaded by the future.\u201d The citizenry is entirely absorbed by the\npresent moment\u2014to the exclusion of everything else.\n\nJust watch them on the street or subway with their devices, and see that empty\nlook on their faces. Like zombies in those horror films, they might have had a\nreal life once, long ago, but they\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like.\n\n> ### \u201cIt\u2019s the past that people have lost. They don\u2019t care about it. They\n> don\u2019t understand it. They don\u2019t want to understand it.\u201d\n\nAnd what about information overload? That has to be true, no?\n\nAh, the reality on the street is much different. As I noted in my recent\narticle on \u201cThe State of the Culture, 2023\u201d people sip that information with a\nvery narrow straw.\n\nYour data stream is like a morphine drip at the hospital. And with the same\nresult\u2014you want to make sure you\u2019re always hooked to the machine that provides\nthe drip.\n\nTikTok and Instagram, for example, can be described in many ways. But\n\u201cinformation overload\u201d or \u201cfuture shock\u201daren\u2019t the words I\u2019d use. Consumers\nhave become very skilled at blocking out information\u2014maybe too skilled. That\u2019s\nwhat happens when your interactions with the real world are reduced to 10 or\n20 second video snippets.\n\nNobody is overloaded with information not in the year 2023. Not even\nstudents\u2014or especially not students.\n\nIf we turn away from technology for a moment, and look instead at culture, we\nabsolutely do not find rapid change. We see the exact opposite.\n\nMovie studios keep releasing the same stories with the same characters. The\nhottest Hollywood star at the Cannes festival this year was Harrison Ford, age\n80. Last year it was comparative youngster Tom Cruise, age 60. Both showed up\nto pitch sequels in which they played the same character they originated four\ndecades ago.\n\nMusical genres don\u2019t change much from year to year, or even from decade to\ndecade. A recent survey found that the most popular song has been the same for\nthree years.\n\nMany of the biggest names in commercial music are the same ones who were\npopular when Toffler peddled his Future Shock concept back in the 1970s. For\nexample, here\u2019s what a search engine told me when I asked about the\nbestselling rock artists in the year 2023.\n\nSo even if tech devices are evolving rapidly\u2014and I\u2019m not entirely convinced of\nthat\u2014the culture is stagnating. It needs more change, not less.\n\nYet Toffler was correct about one thing. People are getting sick.\n\nRates of depression are up. Suicide rates are up. Self-harm and eating\ndisorders and mental illness are rising everywhere. Drugs kill millions of\nindividuals\u2014and it\u2019s not always illegal drugs. Addictions of all sorts plague\nsociety, and \u2018recovery\u2019 programs of all sorts are big business. And so is\n\u2018anger management\u2019\u2014a vocation that didn\u2019t even exist in Toffler\u2019s day. People\ncan\u2019t control their anger, and lash out at the slightest things. Violence is\nat a high point; tolerance at a low point.\n\nToffler saw something of this sort coming\u2014in fact, he probably underestimated\nit. If you look through the index to his book, you won\u2019t find suicide,\ndepression, addiction, or other such topics. But you will find numerous\nreferences to the \u201cnervous system\u201d or \u201cpace of life\u201d or \u201cadaptation.\u201d\n\nHe clearly envisioned an anxious world on the go. People would travel in space\nships. We would be operating complicated machines like Charlie Chaplin in\nModern Times. But that\u2019s not the world we live in now.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t flying in spaceships. (Well, a few billionaires do that, but\nthere are no tickets for us.) In fact, people are barely interested in getting\na driver\u2019s license nowadays. Hey, there\u2019s so much entertainment just sitting\nat home with that tiny screen.\n\nThat\u2019s what Toffler missed. The future came and it didn\u2019t shock us with its\ncomplexity. They simplified everything so we can manage by swiping left or\nright, or just clicking on a button.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cinformation underload\u201d nowadays\u2014and huge corporations work to deliver\nit. They ensure that our digital lives have no shocks or surprises. Their\nalgorithms are designed to deliver today something almost identical to what\nthey gave us yesterday. And tomorrow will be no different.\n\nAs a result, the future has fallen from view, replaced by a sense of stasis.\nAnd so has the past, which ought to be a resource but has become so weightless\nthat it might as well not exist at all. All this is causing real sicknesses,\nand we don\u2019t need to invent new names for them. They\u2019ve been around a while,\nonly now they\u2019re much worse and afflicting more people.\n\nIn a situation like this, we ought to reverse Alvin Toffler\u2019s advice. We need\nmore change, not less. And it ought to be centered on the areas of greatest\nnumbness and disconnectedness. I\u2019m talking about the culture itself, not the\ntechnology.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the place to spell out the necessary agenda\u2014that\u2019s a huge issue\nbeyond our scope here. But I can tell you one thing. The kind of change we\nneed isn\u2019t going to happen on an app.\n\n### Subscribe to The Honest Broker\n\nBy Ted Gioia \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nA trustworthy guide to music, books, arts, media & culture by Ted Gioia\n\n547 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n49 Restacks\n\n547\n\nShare this post\n\n#### In 1970, Alvin Toffler Predicted the Rise of Future Shock\u2014But the Exact\nOpposite Happened\n\nwww.honest-broker.com\n\n166\n\nShare\n\n166 Comments\n\nChris RyanTangentially Speaking with Chri...May 28, 2023\u00b7edited May 28,\n2023Interesting, but I wonder if a lot of your critique would be resolved by\nlooking at other meanings of the word, \"shock.\" You seem to limit yourself to\nsomething being \"shocking,\" whereas I've always interpreted \"Future Shock\" to\nbe more akin to \"being in shock,\" which aligns quite well with the numbness\nyou decry. A state of shock is triggered by events too sudden and overwhelming\nto process: a car accident, a bomb going off, a sudden death of a loved one. I\nthink a good bit of our numbness is due to being oversaturated with immediate\nnews from all over the world (no need to wait for Walter Cronkite to tell it\n\"the way it is\" at 6pm), assurances of impending doom (melting ice caps,\nextinction of pollinators, aquifers running dry, lunatics and fools being\nelected). We are in a state of future shock because too much is going too\nwrong too quickly, leading many of us to wonder if there's any future at\nall.Expand full commentLike (60)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n7 replies\n\nSteve MeyerMay 28, 2023Liked by Ted Gioia\u201cWe are all just prisoners here of\nour own device.\u201d - Eagles, \u2018Hotel California\u2019Expand full commentLike\n(36)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\n164 more comments...\n\nThe State of the Culture, 2024\n\nOr a glimpse into post-entertainment society (it's not pretty)\n\nFeb 18 \u2022\n\nTed Gioia\n\n5,615\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The State of the Culture, 2024\n\nwww.honest-broker.com\n\n584\n\nWhat Can We Learn from Barnes & Noble's Surprising Turnaround?\n\nDigital platforms are struggling, meanwhile a 136-year-old book retailer is\ngrowing again.
