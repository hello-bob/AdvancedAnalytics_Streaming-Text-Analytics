Existing projects will remain unchanged unless manually updated.\n\nThis change helps ensure consistent function performance and faster startup\ntimes. Depending on your function code size, this may reduce cold starts by a\nfew hundred milliseconds.\n\nWhile increasing the function CPU can increase costs for the same duration, it\ncan also make functions execute faster. If functions execute faster, you incur\nless overall function duration usage. This is especially important if your\nfunction runs CPU-intensive tasks.\n\nThis change will be applied to all paid plan customers (Pro and Enterprise),\nno action required.\n\nCheck out our documentation to learn more.\n\nPost\n\nPosted by\n\nShohei Maeda\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nTobias Lins\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nTom Lienard\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nBrian Emerick\n\nTechnical Program Manager\n\nDevelop.Preview.Ship.\n\nVercel is the platform for frontend developers, providing the speed and\nreliability innovators need to create at the moment of inspiration.\n\nStart Deploying\n\nTour the Product\n\n", "frontpage": false}
