In 2021, Proton Mail faced controversy when it complied with a legal\nrequest that led to the arrest of a French climate activist. Under Swiss law,\nProton Mail was compelled to collect and provide information on the\nindividual\u2019s IP address to Swiss authorities, who then shared it with French\npolice.\n\nThe recent case involving the Spanish police this time, highlights privacy\nconcerns and the limits of encrypted communication services under national\nsecurity pretexts, and brings a long-debated subject to the forefront once\nagain.\n\nThe core of the controversy stems from Proton Mail providing the Spanish\npolice with the recovery email address associated with the Proton Mail account\nof an individual using the pseudonym \u2018Xuxo Rondinaire.\u2019 This individual is\nsuspected of being a member of the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra (Catalonia\u2019s police\nforce) and of using their internal knowledge to assist the Democratic Tsunami\nmovement.\n\nUpon receiving the recovery email from Proton Mail, Spanish authorities\nfurther requested Apple to provide additional details linked to that email,\nleading to the identification of the individual.\n\nThis case is particularly noteworthy because it involves a series of requests\nacross different jurisdictions and companies, highlighting the complex\ninterplay between technology firms, user privacy, and law enforcement. The\nrequests were made under the guise of anti-terrorism laws, despite the primary\nactivities of the Democratic Tsunami involving protests and roadblocks, which\nraises questions about the proportionality and justification of such measures.\n\nLike before, Proton Mail\u2019s compliance with these requests is bound by Swiss\nlaw, which mandates cooperation with international legal demands that are\nformalized through proper channels (Swiss court system).\n\nLast year, when we noted that Proton Mail complied with nearly 6,000 data\nrequests in 2022, Proton provided us with an explanation that inbox contents\nremain secure.\n\n> Please note that in all cases email content, attachments, files etc are\n> always encrypted and cannot be read.\n>\n> Proton statement to RestorePrivacy last year\n\nLooking at Proton\u2019s transparency report, we find that Proton Mail complied\nwith 5,971 data requests last year alone, up slightly from the year before.\n\nWith so many data requests going on in the background, it is all the more\nimportant to safeguard the data you share with various services.\n\n### The importance of good OPSEC\n\nThis situation serves as a critical reminder of the importance of maintaining\nstringent OPSEC (operational security). One should always be aware of the\npotential vulnerabilities that come with linking recovery information or\nsecondary services (like Apple accounts) that may not have the same privacy\nsafeguards as a primary encrypted email service.\n\nFor users concerned about privacy, particularly those involved in sensitive or\npolitical activities, OPSEC should be a top concern when using privacy tools.\nIt\u2019s advisable to:\n\n  * Avoid linking recovery emails or phone numbers that can directly tie back to personal identities or primary business activities.\n  * Consider using secondary, disposable emails or virtual phone numbers that offer an additional layer of anonymity.\n  * Use a good VPN service to hide your IP address whenever possible. (Failure to do this is what compromised a Proton Mail user in France who was arrested after after police obtained IP logs.)\n  * Consider purchasing services using an anonymous payment method.\n  * Stay informed about the legal obligations and policies of communication service providers, especially regarding their compliance with international law enforcement requests.\n\nWhile Proton Mail and similar services offer substantial protections and end-\nto-end encryption on their email platform, they are not immune to legal and\ngovernmental pressures. Users must navigate these waters carefully, balancing\nthe need for security with the potential legal obligations of their service\nproviders.\n\nRestorePrivacy has reached out to Proton Mail for a comment on the case and\ntheir exact involvement, but a statement wasn\u2019t immediately available. We will\nupdate this article as soon as we hear back.\n\n#### About Alex Lekander\n\nAlex Lekander is the Editor-in-Chief and founder of RestorePrivacy.

John Doe\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nProtonMail seems to be getting a bit too high profile for my likes. And 6,000\ndata requests complied with? Damn. I\u2019m not even faulting Proton here. And\nlegal requests through the court can\u2019t be ignored, but this all doesn\u2019t sit\nwell with me.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n## Sidebar\n\n#### Follow Us:\n\n  * X\n  * Mastodon\n  * Facebook\n\nDigital Privacy Essentials: Secure Browser Private Search Engines Secure Email\nBest Password Managers Secure Messaging Services Best Ad Blockers Best VPN\nServices Secure Cloud Storage\n\nAbout RestorePrivacy\n\nContact\n\nPrivacy & Security Guides: Privacy Tools Alternatives to Google Products\nFirefox Privacy Modifications Five Eyes, 9 Eyes, 14 Eyes Spying Browser\nFingerprinting Is Tor Safe?
