Our aim is\nto stimulate the growth of a unified Europe by continuously innovating in\npayments, which is an important underlying feature of our economy.\"\n\nDr. Joachim Schmalzl\n\nChairman Of the Board\n\n## Starting a new era of European Payments\n\nWe are dedicated to building a unique and new payment platform that embodies\ntrust, efficiency, and adaptability. We set a new standard to serve the needs\nof people and businesses in Europe.\n\n## Introducing wero\n\nAt the core of EPI\u2019s offering is wero, our digital wallet solution. Designed\nwith the user in mind, this intuitive app streamlines payments across various\nbank accounts, offering unparalleled transparency and control. As wero\nevolves, it\u2019s poised to support additional payment methods from third parties,\nenriching the payment experience. Beyond mere transactions, wero\u2019s vision\nencompasses a suite of value-added services, potentially including innovative\nbuy-now-pay-later options backed by banks, digital identity verification\n(e-ID), and integration of merchant loyalty programs, all seamlessly woven\ninto the payment process.\n\n## A flexible payment scheme\n\nEPI allows existing instant account-to-account payment infrastructures to be\nused in a wider range of use cases. The payment applications will extend and\nbe enhanced over time. Customers will be able to use any of their eligible\nbank accounts to pay instantly, securely and with ease.\n\n## EPI Ecosystem\n\nWe are creating a payment ecosystem, with EPI acting as the bridge between a\nmultitude of parties in the complex payment landscape. Technically speaking,\nEPI will therefore be a 4-corner scheme.\n\nA strong connection\n\n## Founding Shareholders\n\n## epi in the news\n\n##### EPI CEO Says Europe Ready for One Digital Wallet\n\nVisit article\n\n##### The European payment service will finally come to fruition\n\nVisit article\n\n##### This is how Europe will seek to become more independent when it comes to\npayments\n\nVisit article\n\n## Keep in the loop\n\nRead the latest news from the company\n\nVisit Newsroom\n\n## Meet us at events all across Europe\n\n20 March 2024\n\n#### CAP IT\n\nFabrice Le Gall, EPI Country Lead Manager France, will participate in a\nroundtable discussion to explore EPI\u2019s strategy for this year and introduce\nhow wero will offer a new way of payment for consumers.\n\nFind out more\n\n21 March 2024\n\n#### Money Motion\n\nLudovic Francesconi, EPI Chief Member & Strategy Officer, will discuss the\nfuture of payments in Europe in a panel discussion.\n\nFind out more\n\n17-19 April 2024\n\n#### Payment Nomads\n\nFabian Mansfeld, Executive Management Member, will join this event to talk\nabout the payments landscape and give insights about EPI.\n\nFind out more\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\nWhat is \u201cEPI\u201d?\n\n\u201cEPI\u201d stands for \u201cEuropean Payments Initiative\u201d launched by 16 banks and\nfinancial service companies to create a new digital wallet (Wero) and a\nunified account-to-account solution.\n\nThe solution aims to become a new standard in payments for European consumers\nand merchants across all types of retail transactions including in-store,\nonline, and \u201cperson-to-person\u201d.\n\nWhy EPI?\n\nEPI shareholders aim to enhance the market by introducing Wero, a\ncomprehensive payment solution based on the Instant Payment scheme as defined\nby the European Payments council (EPC). Wero is designed to support a variety\nof transactions, including merchant and person-to-person payments, offering\nsecurity, immediacy, and ease of use. This initiative aligns with Europe\u2019s\npush towards instant payments, echoing calls from European authorities for\nbanks and payment providers to develop an independent, alternative payment\nsystem based on Instant Payment schemes.\n\nWhat are the benefits of EPI?\n\nEPI aims to revolutionise digital payments in Europe by offering a consistent\nsolution across all major retail scenarios, including peer-to-peer (P2P),\npoint of sale (POS), and online commerce. This initiative addresses the\ncurrent fragmented payment landscape in Europe, fulfilling the long-standing\ndemand from both merchants and consumers for a unified pan-European payment\napproach.\n\nBenefits to European Citizens and Merchants \u2013 For Consumers: EPI promises\ninnovation in payment methods, transitioning from the 50% of transactions\nstill conducted in cash to a more digital approach. \u2013 For Merchants: It offers\na seamless, competitive, and unified payment solution, available to all\nEuropean consumers.\n\nWhat is \"wero\"?\n\nWero is a new payment solution that aims to become the standard for European\nconsumers and merchants.

EPI as a new and innovative market player may be expected to\nincrease competition both in terms of quality and conditions.\n\nWhy is wero based on Instant Payments?\n\nInstant Payments allow the development of a service covering multiple payment\nuse cases such as paying friends and family, paying in a shop, paying online,\npaying a bill or an invoice, which no other single solution offers for the\ntime being.\n\nWho is involved in EPI at this stage?\n\nEPI is open for European market players, individual banks or banking\ncommunities, as well as payment service providers to apply and join EPI. For\nthe time being, 16 European banks and financial services companies are\ninvolved spanning across five European countries, including leading pan-\nEuropean third-party acquirers.\n\nHow does EPI position wero towards other payment schemes (local and/or\ninternational ones)?\n\nLike existing international solutions, Wero is being designed as a consistent\nsolution across countries. EPI participants will progressively roll out Wero\nto their customers. EPI\u2019s ambition is for Wero to become a new standard of\npayments in Europe, thus offering an independent European alternative. Wero as\nan emerging scheme intends to pursue collaborative discussions with both\ninternational and domestic payment schemes.\n\nDoes EPI cooperate with merchants or merchant initiatives?\n\nEPI has interacted and continues interacting with European merchant\nassociations to get their feedback on the solution and ensure that Wero will\ncater for their needs.\n\nI'm a journalist, how do I submit a media request?\n\nEPI Company continues work and preparations for launch.
