We compare this year's event with Current 2023\n(previously known as Kafka Summit Americas) to identify the discernible shift\nin Confluent's strategic vision.\n\ncontents_\n\nThe Universal Data Product: A New Paradigm\n\nKafka and Kora: Pioneering Data Streaming Innovation\n\nBlending Batch and Streaming: A Unified Approach\n\nThe Rise of GenAI\n\nData streaming is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field, underscored by the IPO\nof Confluent in 2021. Founded by the original creators of Apache Kafka,\nConfluent's public offering has magnified attention on this domain. Startups\nlike RisingWave, Redpanda, Materialize, Decodable, and WarpStream have secured\nsignificant venture capital to develop next-generation streaming platforms.\nMeanwhile, established companies are also making notable advances. For\ninstance:\n\n  * Databricks has introduced the ambitious Lightspeed project, aiming to revolutionize Spark Structured Streaming and power the Delta Live Table within its lakehouse platform.\n\n  * Snowflake has debuted Dynamic Tables and Snowpipe Streaming, efforts to seamlessly integrate batch and streaming pipelines.\n\n  * MongoDB Atlas has entered the stream processing arena with its new platform, now in public preview .\n\nThe Kafka Summit, hosted by Confluent, is the preeminent conference in the\ndata streaming sector, attracting a global community of enthusiasts and\nprofessionals. Having attended every Kafka Summit post-COVID, we've witnessed\nfirst-hand the ongoing evolution in this space. The 2024 Kafka Summit in\nLondon maintained its reputation as a magnet for data streaming aficionados\nworldwide. Confluent\u2019s recap of the event highlighted several innovations,\nincluding the GA of managed Flink, the newly released Tableflow, Kora, and\nmore.\n\nBut which topics should you pay special attention to? We compare this year's\nevent with Current 2023 (previously known as Kafka Summit Americas) to\nidentify the discernible shift in Confluent's strategic vision.\n\n## The Universal Data Product: A New Paradigm\n\nThe concept of a data product represents a groundbreaking shift in the data\nlandscape. It enables users to develop applications seamlessly atop a robust\ndata foundation, eliminating concerns about the intricate data infrastructure\nbeneath. Traditionally, data systems like Spark and Snowflake, managed by data\ninfrastructure teams, have served as the backbone for analytical processes.\nThese teams create layers of abstraction, allowing data service colleagues to\nutilize APIs without needing to navigate the complexities of the underlying\ninfrastructure.\n\nConfluent aims to redefine the essence of the data product, choosing Kafka as\nits foundation rather than relying on batch systems such as Spark and\nSnowflake. This strategic shift is designed to simplify user interaction with\ndata infrastructure, promoting Kafka from a mere tool for data movement to a\ncomprehensive solution for data management and storage.\n\nData, with its inherent value, acts as a magnet, attracting more interactions\nand, consequently, generating increased revenue. But how does Confluent set\nitself apart from competitors like Snowflake and Databricks? Shaun Clowes, the\nChief Product Officer at Confluent, sheds light on this distinction. While\nanalytical data products have matured, they often overlook the dynamism of\nreal-time data events. Confluent's vision extends beyond the analytical domain\nto encompass the operational sphere, capturing data at its source. This\napproach not only preserves the immediacy of operational data but also\nintegrates it seamlessly into analytical processes.\n\nShould Confluent realize this ambitious vision, it stands to redefine its\nmarket position significantly, potentially surpassing industry giants like\nSnowflake and Databricks in both value and influence.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: Confluent articulated their ambition to develop\ndata products leveraging Kafka as the foundational technology.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: Confluent articulated their ambition to develop\ndata products leveraging Kafka as the foundational technology.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: Instead of building yet another\nanalytical data products, Confluent wants to innovate universal data product.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: Instead of building yet another\nanalytical data products, Confluent wants to innovate universal data product.\n\n## Kafka and Kora: Pioneering Data Streaming Innovation\n\nAt its core, Confluent is synonymous with Kafka. Its primary business revolves\naround enhancing and promoting Kafka, a technology deemed indispensable by\nvirtually every modern company. The allure of open-source Kafka lies not only\nin its functionality but also in its critical role across various industries.\nRecent developments have introduced notable enhancements, including the two-\nphase commit mechanism and improved client observability, as detailed in\nKIP-939. These advancements promise to revolutionize data consistency\nmaintenance in Kafka-powered systems, particularly by facilitating atomic\ntransactions across diverse databases and Kafka topics. The implementation of\nsuch features, like the \"dual write\" technique, aims to achieve exactly-once\nsemantics (EOS) in distributed environments, a significant milestone for data\nintegrity.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: Kafka\u2019s roadmap.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: Kafka\u2019s roadmap.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: Two-Phase Commit and Client\nObservability are the two newly added features.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: Two-Phase Commit and Client\nObservability are the two newly added features.\n\nAs Kafka's marketplace expands, the competition intensifies, with new entrants\naiming to carve out their share. A recurring challenge for users has been\nKafka's cost. In response, innovative solutions have emerged to alleviate\nfinancial burdens. Redpanda, for example, employs a tiered storage strategy to\nslash cloud expenses significantly. WarpStream leverages cloud object stores\nlike S3 to offer a Kafka-compatible platform, while Upstash introduces a\nserverless Kafka model, enhancing accessibility and cost-efficiency.\n\nIn response to these market dynamics, Confluent has unveiled the Kora engine.\nThis groundbreaking initiative is set to reinforce Confluent\u2019s leadership\nthrough features like multi-tenancy, serverless abstraction, and a separation\nof networking, storage, and computing layers, coupled with automated\noperations and universal access. Kora is poised to solidify Confluent's\ndominant position by offering a solution that is not only up to 16 times\nfaster than traditional Kafka but also more cost-effective, addressing one of\nthe most pressing concerns of Kafka users.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: Kora is 10X faster than open-source Kafka.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: Kora is 10X faster than open-source Kafka.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: Kora is now 16X faster than open-\nsource Kafka.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: Kora is now 16X faster than open-\nsource Kafka.\n\n## Blending Batch and Streaming: A Unified Approach\n\nThe perception of streaming as a niche often emerges when comparing data\nstreaming companies with their batch processing counterparts. While it's\ndebatable whether this viewpoint holds true in 2024, the necessity for batch\nprocessing solutions remains undisputed, and their relevance is unlikely to\nwane even as the streaming market expands.\n\nConfluent's strategy transcends the traditional boundaries of the streaming\ndomain, aiming to merge the realms of batch and streaming. This fusion is\nintended to capture market share across both operational and analytical\nsegments. But what's the method behind this visionary approach?\n\nA significant shift was observed at Current 2023, where Confluent heavily\nemphasized Flink's dual capabilities in batch and streaming, its potential as\na streaming warehouse, and its compatibility with data lake technologies like\nIceberg, Paimon, and Hudi. Interestingly, Delta Lake was not mentioned. Fast\nforward to this year, Confluent has pivoted its focus towards Iceberg,\nchampioning it as the cornerstone of its data lake strategy, backed by\nheavyweight supporters like AWS and Snowflake.\n\nThis move towards Iceberg is not merely an integration but a profound\ntransformation in Confluent's strategy. The introduction of TableFlow marks a\npivotal advancement, enabling seamless integration of Kafka data into data\nlakes, warehouses, or analytics engines as Apache Iceberg tables.\nTraditionally, bridging operational data with analytical insights has been\nfraught with complexity, cost, and fragility. Confluent's TableFlow aspires to\nstreamline this integration, promising a more cohesive data ecosystem.\n\nAs TableFlow reaches maturity, Confluent positions itself to challenge\nindustry giants like Snowflake and Databricks directly. This bold step not\nonly reaffirms Iceberg's status as the preferred data lake format but also\nsignifies Confluent's ambition to redefine the data landscape.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: Flink brings mixed execution mode and has the\npotential to be the streaming warehouse.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: Flink brings mixed execution mode and has the\npotential to be the streaming warehouse.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: Confluent now fully embraces Apache\nIceberg.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: Confluent now fully embraces Apache\nIceberg.\n\n## The Rise of GenAI\n\nGenAI has emerged as the quintessential buzzword of 2024, capturing the\nattention of the tech world. Engaging in discussions about GenAI has become\nalmost a prerequisite to staying relevant in the rapidly advancing tech\nlandscape.\n\nAt Current 2023, Confluent unveiled its AI ambitions, albeit in broad strokes.\nThe discourse primarily revolved around the potential of data streaming\nplatforms to facilitate real-time data ingestion and processing, leaving much\nto the imagination regarding specifics.\n\nBy the time of the Kafka Summit London 2024, Confluent's narrative around\nGenAI had gained clarity and depth. The conversation evolved beyond the basic\npremise of transferring data between operational databases and vector\ndatabases. Confluent articulated a more sophisticated vision, incorporating\nthe use of Flink for invoking external vector embedding services, thus marking\na significant step forward in their AI strategy.\n\nDespite this progress, the roadmap for implementing Confluent's GenAI\ninitiatives remains somewhat nebulous, lacking detailed applications and real-\nworld use cases. Furthermore, the challenge of handling unstructured data\u2014such\nas text, images, videos, and speeches\u2014for model training persists. The extent\nto which Confluent's solutions can effectively bridge the gap between\nstructured and unstructured data realms is yet to be fully understood, leaving\na space ripe for innovation and exploration.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: the debut of Confluent\u2019s AI dream.\n\nSlide deck from Current 2023: the debut of Confluent\u2019s AI dream.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: The AI dream is now fleshed out with\nFlink and vector embedding service.\n\nSlide deck from Kafka Summit London 2024: The AI dream is now fleshed out with\nFlink and vector embedding service.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo encapsulate Confluent\u2019s strategic focus, four key terms come to mind: high-\nlevel abstraction, cost efficiency, unified systems, and GenAI. These pillars\nunderscore a broader shift in technology preferences and needs\u2014towards tools\nthat are simultaneously simpler and more potent, cost-effective, and enhanced\nby AI to streamline daily tasks.\n\nFar from being a niche, streaming technology represents both the current\nlandscape and the future trajectory of data management and analysis.\n\n  * /*Copy Link*/\n\n  * /*Twitter*/\n\n  * /*Linkedin*/\n\nYingjun Wu\n\nFounder and CEO at RisingWave Labs\n\n  * Copy Link\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n\nRelated Posts_\n\n[ Thought Leadership ]\n\nBuilding a Stream Processing Platform for Developers\n\nAt this point in 2024, is the timing ripe for the democratization of stream\nprocessing?
