The documents, purportedly an invoice from Loblaws to a No Frills\nstore, highlight significant profit margins, raising questions about fairness\nand transparency in retail pricing.\n\nAt the center of the revelations is the Gross Profit Margin (GPM), a key\nmetric in retail indicating the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of\ngoods sold. In this case, the leaked documents reveal GPMs as high as 53.75%\nfor President\u2019s Choice Unsalted Butter Alternative, suggesting a considerable\nmarkup on a staple grocery item.\n\nThe retail giant has long been marred with issues on extremely high grocery\nprices, with Metro Inc. (TSX: MRU) taking a legal action alleging that Loblaws\nfalsely implicated Metro in a bread price-fixing conspiracy, causing damage to\nits reputation.\n\nBased on indicated GPMs, some of the products sold at more than 40% margin\ninclude: No Name Sour Cream (51.48%), President\u2019s Choice Original Lemonade\n(49.17%), Derlea Garlic Spread (46.55%), Gay Lea Unsalted Butter (45.57%),\nSilk True Almond (44.66%), Astro Original Yogurt (43.41%), President\u2019s Choice\nKefir (41.38%), and Kraft Natural Cheese (40.81%).\n\nBased on the summary of this particular leaked invoice, profit margin on dairy\nproducts came in at 28.7% on the average while natural foods\u2019 margin came in\nat 39.3% on the average.\n\nThis comes after Loblaw has had a successful fourth quarter with a revenue\nincrease of 3.7%, reaching $14.53 billion, which surpassed analyst\nexpectations. Adjusted earnings per share also rose by 13.6%, reaching $2.00\nper share, higher than the expected $1.90 per share. The company attributed\nthis success to its focus on improving its retail operations, resulting in\nincreased customer traffic and market share.\n\nFor the full year, Loblaw reported revenue of $59.53 billion, up by 5.4%\ncompared to the previous year. Gross profit margin for the year came in at\n32%, comparably similar to 2022. Adjusted earnings per common share increased\nby 13.6% to $7.75.\n\nA noteworthy aspect of the year was the company\u2019s buyback program, during\nwhich it repurchased 14.5 million shares for $1.73 billion. Additionally,\nretail free cash flow amounted to $1.69 billion. These buybacks occurred amid\nconcerns about high food prices, with the federal government urging grocery\ncompanies to reduce costs under a \u201cgrocery code of conduct.\u201d\n\nDespite record profit for Loblaw\u2019s, chairman Galen Weston attempted to pass\nthe blame to grocery suppliers, while also stating that food prices would not\ngo down if Loblaw reduced its profit margins.\n\n\u201cI do understand that Canadians are feeling this pressure. They look at these\nbig numbers and they think to themselves, \u2018Gosh, if that company would not\nmake so much profit, our food prices would go down.\u2019 But that\u2019s not the way\nthat it would actually work,\u201d commented Weston in December.\n\n> Loblaw\u2019s Dropped $1.7 Billion On Buybacks In 2023 While Fighting Against\n> Grocery Code Of Conduct\n\nMost recently, the retail giant also faced scrutiny after it disclosed the\nhefty compensation package of its new chief executive, Per Bank, totaling\n$22.1 million for the year 2023. Bank, who assumed the role on November 1st,\nreceived a one-time $18 million award to replace forfeited compensation from\nhis former employer.\n\nThe package breakdown revealed Bank\u2019s $1.315 million annual salary, a target\nannual bonus of nearly $2 million, and a target of $7.2 million in annual\nlong-term incentives for the current year. Despite his brief tenure, Bank\nreceived approximately $3.75 million for his first 60 days on the job,\nalongside additional benefits including rent coverage and tax equalization\npayments.\n\n> Per Bank Made Bank: Loblaw CEO Made A Hefty $22 Million Amid Boycott Calls\n\nLoblaw Companies last traded at $148.80 on the TSX.\n\nERRATUM: An earlier version of this article noted that the gross profit margin\nfor select products were \u201ccuriously at 0%\u201d, without noting that there were no\ndelivered products\u2013hence, the zero value of the margin. This has been\ncorrected.\n\nInformation for this briefing was found via Reddit and the sources mentioned.\nThe author has no securities or affiliations related to this organization.

Metro and Foodland as well. However\nI\u2019ve noticed since Galen Weston Jr took over no Frills and some of the other\nstores have not been the same. I know that many many things are doing\nshrinkflation, I myself have seen markups on products at a NoFrills store that\nwere not on sale,regular priced at around $2.99 for presidents choice\nvegetable crackers (sweet potato and such) I had bought two boxes that came to\naround almost $6 after tax. About a month or so ago that I was in there saw\nthe same product they were now displayed something like 2 boxes for $8.99-9.99\n. I took a picture with my phone, and loud enough for people could hear it I\nsaid \u201d Go FURS Galen Weston Jr. \u201d Disgusting. We also had a Weston\u2019s bakery in\nmy town for a very long long time. Around Christmas you could always smell the\nmaking fruit cake (blah, FRUIT CAKE!!!) I had heard rumors that the woman that\nused to run it at least on the floor anyway was a slave driver. Maybe she\u2019s\nrelated to the family? This was before COVID hit in 2020 that they were\nalready making changes. I\u2019m not sure about Galen\u2019s father, but he and his wife\nare monsters. They certainly cannot be human. I\u2019m sorry but I find it hard to\nbelieve anything that comes out of somebody\u2019s mouth who has been already in\nand out of court still twice for tax evasion ,tax fraud, offshore accounts\nlaundered through companies that are supposedly owned by the family or friends\nof the family... And let\u2019s not even get started on the whole fact that they\nbroke a contract which I had foreseen would happen once these grocery stores\nmade their money they would recinde on the deal that they had made about\npaying thier frontline employees \u201cdanger pay\u201d , the extra $2 an hour that was\nadded to their paycheck when COVID first hit back in early 2020, and no frills\nas well as other grocery stores were responsible for people hoarding by\nputting up signs saying only so many per customer, knowing full well the\nramifications that it would lead to so they can engage in unruly gouging\npractices. The end result was that they cause the droughts for paper products,\nwater and baking goods. Maybe we need to re think at Soylent Green as being a\npossible renewable food source I\u2019m sure Galen Weston Jr already is.....\n\nReply\n\n  * DJ\n\nApril 12, 2024 1:59 AM at 1:59 am\n\nPermalink\n\nUnbelievable! Well, that\u2019s not true, for we all know prices are outrageous\nthese days. I wish Loeb would come back, they were my \u201cgoto\u201d store. Never\nliked going to Loblaws. Too big, and too expensive. Loblaws tried ratting on\nLoeb over the bread fixing scandal, but yet Loblaws gets immunity from being\nheld accountable for being a part of the scandal, themselves. All because\nLoblaws was the one company to \u201cwhistleblow\u201d on the scandal. I imagine down in\nthe Muskoka region, good ole Galen Weston, is laughing at all of us while\nacting like Scrooge McDuck. While bricks of cash are being used to add\nadditions to the \u201cWeston Compound\u201d.... The closest grocery store nearest me,\nis Loblaws. So I\u2019m forced to go there. I\u2019m disabled. So I shop for as much as\nI can put on my chair to go back home. I rarely do delivery, unless online\nshopping. Then I use Walmart. I would stop and even tried not going to\nLoblaws. For I don\u2019t like Weston practices. He is shady AF. They were a major\nplayer in the bread scandal, but because they were the \u201crat\u201d., nothing happens\nto them. Or very little did. Not enough for them to change. Almost a 54%\nmarkup??????????? Unbelievable!!!!! But then again, because it\u2019s Loblaws, it\nis very BELIEVABLE! BOYCOTT LOBLAWS!!\n\nReply\n\n    * GDI\n\nApril 13, 2024 1:42 AM at 1:42 am\n\nPermalink\n\nThis is only half the story.
