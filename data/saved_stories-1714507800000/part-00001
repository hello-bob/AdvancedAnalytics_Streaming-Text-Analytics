There's a limit of 250 new feeds for each user.\n\nYou can also subscribe to feeds other people have added. No limit there.\nSubscribe to as many as you like.\n\nEveryone can see everything. Our lists and categories are there for everyone\nto use.\n\nA FeedLand community works together shaping news flows.\n\n### The 250-feed limit\n\nThere's a limit of 250 new feeds per user.\n\nA new feed is one that no one else is subscribed to. So if you're clicking a\ncheckbox in someone else's feed list, that won't count against your 250 feed\nlimit.\n\nAt some point we will provide a way to purchase more subscriptions if you run\nup against the limit.\n\n### Nothing is hidden\n\nSomething important about FeedLand. Almost everything is open to everyone. I\ncan see your feed list and you can see mine. I can read the news as you see it\nand vice versa.\n\nObviously only you can sign in as you, that much is secret, as are your\nsettings.\n\nYou can only subscribe to feeds if you're signed in.\n\n### How to sign up\n\nIf this is your first time using FeedLand, you'll need to create a new\naccount.\n\n  1. Go to feedland.com.\n\n  2. You should see a dialog where you can log in using WordPress.\n\n  3. We also have a way to sign up with just an email address. Instructions for that are coming soon.\n\nAfter logging in, you're offered a chance to add some feeds to your empty feed\nlist. It's easier to learn the product with a few feeds you're subscribed to.\nAfter they're added you will be taken to your Feed List page.\n\n### Reading the news\n\nTo read news from the feeds you're subscribed to, choose My News from the main\nmenu.\n\nThis is the primary way to read news in FeedLand.\n\n### Finding feeds\n\nChoose Recent users from the first menu. Click on a name to see what they're\nsubscribed to.\n\nIf you see a feed you want to subscribe to, click the checkbox. That's all you\nhave to do.\n\nAnother way to find feeds is to look in the Hotlist or the Subscription log,\naccessible from the first menu.\n\nTo get back to your feed list, choose My feed list from the first menu.\n\n### Questions\n\nIf you have questions about how to use the product, post an issue in this\ngroup.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
