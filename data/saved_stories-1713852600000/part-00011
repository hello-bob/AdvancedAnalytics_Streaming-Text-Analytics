Since years. On and off... more off than on honestly. Because\nthere\u2019s no fun in soliloquies. But I will be happy to chime in again as soon I\nsee active forks on githubSo have fun browsing this time-killing page... 150+\nposts are waiting to make you wonder where the time went  \n---  \n  \nThere\u2019s a rough schedule where this project should go, given there are enough\nclever people joining in or at least display a certain degree of interest. So\nthere\u2019s a skech of the main-phases, aka \u201cThe Plan\u201d (without dates):\n\n### Sk\u00f6ll\n\nAs said in the intro, Sk\u00f6ll is about \u201ccatching\u201d the sun, i.e. get the original\nHelios 1.31 sources to compile on Solaris. This includes\n\n  * cleaning up the code\n  * weed out unneccesary parts (e.g. the TI DSP code)\n  * smooth the edges (There are multiple strange code-constructs which should be cleaned)\n  * get a general understanding of it all\n\n### Hati\n\nNext phase/release/step after that will be \u201cHati\u201d, the other wolf who chases\nthe moon \u2013 less mystic, this means getting the \u201cHelios-Sk\u00f6ll\u201d sources to\ncompile on Linux. Some tools already do, e.g. the Transputer Assembler \u2018as\u2019...\nthe Norcroft-C compiler is another story.\n\nAnd as we all know, when Sk\u00f6ll and Hati finally managed to hunt down the sun\nand the moon, the world will be destroyed and reborn:\n\n### Ragnar\u00f6k!\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not the end of the world. I leave it open for now what that\nmeans in terms of Helios, but maybe there will be a critical mass of\nparticipants in the community to push \u201cHelios-Hati\u201d forward into version 1.4\nrunning on x86 or current ARM implementations like Raspberry Pi and the like?\n\n### Secondary theater of War\n\nWell, then there\u2019s another part of Helios which needs some attention: The\nserver. This is the piece of software handling the communication between the\nHost (e.g. your DOS Box) and the connected Helios System (e.g. your\nTransputer(farm)). There are several Server sources in the\n[HeliosRoot/]ioproc/server folder like DOS, Windows, RS6000, HP9000,\nInteractive UNIX, Sun3/4/i386, SCO etc... obviously all supporting very old\nversions of their OSes, e.g. Windows 3.x or Solaris 2.\n\nSo this part will need some love, too. I will mainly concentrate on DOS\n(that\u2019s the [HeliosRoot/]ioproc/server/ibm folder), because that\u2019s what I use\nto talk to Helios. To support more recent ways of communication than\nISA/SBUS/VME-cards, we have to create a new server, for example for Mikes USB-\nLink Interface.\n\n  * share\n  * share\n\nARMLinuxportingSolaris.

In part I hoped that if just one or two people got\ninterested and got involved, it might help.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Axel says:\n\nDecember 9, 2021 at 8:34\n\nThanks Liam! Yeah, this is the outer corner of an outer corner of the web \u2013\nvery special interest. For all of you who are interested in getting started\nwith Transputers etc. I can provide help and hardware, even if you like to use\nyour Apple II or C64 as host\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
