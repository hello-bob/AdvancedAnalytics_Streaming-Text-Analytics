It was dark, there were no warning signs or barriers around the\nvo\u00e7oroca, and before he knew it, the car - with him inside - plunged into the\nvast hole.\n\n\u201cWhen the car slid, even though it was falling quickly, I thought of my\nyoungest son,\u201d he tells the BBC.\n\nBaby Gael had turned four months old the day before. \u201cI asked God to protect\nme so that I could raise my little son,\u201d says Lt Silveira.\n\nHe was knocked unconscious and woke up at the bottom of the ravine three hours\nlater. After a complicated rescue operation and months of convalescence, he\ncan now walk without crutches.\n\nJos\u00e9 Silveira nearly died when he fell into the ravine\n\nHis experience is a vivid example of the risks facing Buriticupu\u2019s 70,000\nresidents.\n\nAs more gullies appear, there are fears that the city in Maranh\u00e3o state, on\nthe edge of the Amazon rainforest, could be split in two. At 350m above sea\nlevel, Buriticupu has about 30 gullies, with the largest two separated by less\nthan 1km.\n\n\u201cIf the authorities don\u2019t contain this, they will meet and form a river,\u201d says\nEdilea Dutra Pereira, a geologist and professor at the Federal University of\nMaranh\u00e3o.\n\nGullies have been part of the Earth\u2019s geological history for millions of\nyears.\n\nBut Prof Pereira and other experts we spoke to said that existing gullies are\nexpanding more rapidly and they fear new ones will open because of climate\nchange, which can make rainfall more intense.\n\nAnd in places where cities grow without the right planning and infrastructure\nto deal with rainwater, the risk increases.\n\nBrazil is the worst-affected country in Latin America, but Mexico, Colombia,\nEcuador and Argentina also suffer from the same problem. And beyond the\ncontinent, countries in Africa, such as Angola, the Democratic Republic of\nCongo and Nigeria - where some gullies are more than 2km long - are also\naffected.\n\nThis type of erosion threatens fertile agricultural land in some parts of\nChina, the US and Europe too.\n\n## \u201cToo dangerous\u201d to live here\n\nThere are no official statistics for gully-related deaths, but the authorities\nin Buriticupu say gullies have swallowed up at least 50 houses and some\nresidents have had to abandon their homes, leaving neighbourhoods deserted.\n\nMarisa Cardoso Freire\u2019s house sits on the edge of a gully and was labelled\n\u201chigh risk\u201d by the local Civil Defence Force in May 2023.\n\nAlong with 100 other families, she had to leave her home and move to another\npart of Buriticupu.\n\nCity Hall promised to cover the rent of new homes for displaced people, but\nMarisa says the municipality has not paid rent on time and she has been\nthreatened with eviction.\n\nWhen we contacted Buriticupu City Hall to ask what was happening, it failed to\nrespond.\n\nMarisa is struggling to accept that she has lost her home\n\nAt Marisa\u2019s old home, two of the family's dogs fell into the canyon and died.\n\nThen one day she was trying to get her 10-year-old son Enzo, who is autistic,\nto come back into the house and she raised her voice.\n\nEnzo got angry and ran to the edge of the gully. \u201cIf you shout at me again,\nI'll throw myself in the hole,\u201d he threatened.\n\n> \u201cThat's when I told my husband that we couldn't stay here any longer, it\u2019s\n> too dangerous\u201d\n\nMarisa Cardoso\n\nShe will probably never be able to live in the home she built.\n\n\u201cWhen I left, my heart hurt because it's something we fought so hard to\nachieve.\u201d\n\n## How did it reach this point?\n\nDeforestation plays a big part in this type of soil degradation.\n\nBuriticupu is now an arid, stony place but it is part of the Amazon rainforest\nand was once covered in trees, such as cedar, West Indian locust and ip\u00ea.\n\nIn the 1990s the timber industry was booming here. There were more than 50\nsawmills working 24 hours a day. Twenty years later, most of the city's native\nvegetation was gone.\n\n> \u201cThe issue of vegetation is essential, because during a rainy event, it\n> reduces the impact of raindrops\u201d\n\nEdilea Dutra Pereira Geologist and professor at the Federal University of\nMaranh\u00e3o\n\nWhen there are not enough plants or trees to absorb the rain...\n\nthe drops dislodge soil particles and water collects on the surface.\n\nStreams form and wear the soil away.\n\nGullies or ravines can be created.\n\nWhen there are not enough plants or trees to absorb the rain...\n\nthe drops dislodge soil particles and water collects on the surface.\n\nStreams form and wear the soil away.\n\nGullies or ravines can be created.\n\nClimate change can exacerbate the process in areas prone to gully erosion as\nit can lead to more intense rainfall.\n\nBuriticupu is experiencing more violent storms than it used to, according to\nJuarez Mota Pinheiro, a climatologist at the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o.\n\nIn the first months of 2023, the state of Maranh\u00e3o faced one of the worst\nfloods in its history. More than 60 municipalities went into a state of\nemergency, thousands of people were made homeless and there were dozens of\ndeaths.\n\nThis ravine is one of about 30 in Buriticupu\n\n\u201cRainfall intensity is predicted to increase by 10% to 15% [globally by the\nend of the century]. That may not sound like much, but if you have more and\nmore episodes of extreme rainfall, the dynamics of erosion changes,\u201d says\nMatthias Vanmaercke, from KU Leuven University in Belgium.\n\nHe and his colleague Jean Poesen analysed data from more than 700 gullies\naround the world and concluded that if extreme rainfall increases by that\namount, it could double (or even triple in the worst-case scenario) the risks\nof gully erosion.\n\n\u201cYou'll have a hard time finding a decent scientist that will not agree with\nthe fact that climate change will probably make this worse,\u201d Prof Vanmaercke\nsays.\n\n## Fear of the rain\n\nThis phenomenon is affecting people across the world, including millions in\nAfrica.\n\nThe capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kinshasa, has hundreds of\nurban gullies - one of which is 2km long. There are more than 165km of gullies\nin the city, which is home to 12 million people.\n\nA main road in the Mont Ngafula district in Kinshasa collapsed into a gully in\n2021\n\nIn just one night of heavy rain in Kinshasa in December 2022, 60 people died\nwhen their homes fell into a ravine.\n\nAlexandre Kadada was there.\n\n\u201cIt happened within the space of 30 or 40 minutes. The gully started to open\nup and all the houses disappeared. The neighbourhood was unrecognisable,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n\u201cMy belongings, my house, everything was gone. I only saved my children and my\nwife.\u201d\n\nMr Kadada\u2019s neighbour and her four children were among the victims. The\nwoman\u2019s husband was left disabled.\n\nAlexandre Kadada is now president of a group representing victims of the\ntragedy\n\nMr Kadada's children are now frightened at the slightest hint of bad weather.\n\n\u201cIt was the rain that disrupted everything. The rain brought death and\ndespair,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe really consider it to be a new geohazard of the Anthropocene,\u201d says Prof\nVanmaercke. The Anthropocene is a term used by some scientists to refer to\nrecent times, when human activities have profoundly affected the planet.\n\nThe population of Kinshasa is expected to grow to 20 million by 2030 and 35\nmillion by 2050, becoming the largest megacity in Africa, according to the\nWorld Bank.\n\nUncontrolled urban growth can involve cutting down trees \u2013 a natural barrier\nto erosion - and illegal occupation of potentially unstable areas.\n\nIn Buriticupu, people also fear the rain.\n\n\u201cThere are times when land the size of a house collapses. It makes a violent\nnoise, it shakes everything. Then people cry. The sadness it causes is crazy,\u201d\nsays 52-year-old Jo\u00e3o Batista, a mechanic who owns a workshop on the edge of a\nhuge gully.\n\n\u201cI've lost 40% of my customers. Many are afraid to stop by,\u201d he says. But he\nrefuses to leave.\n\nThe vo\u00e7oroca behind his workshop was once a playground for children, he says,\nbut the gully swallowed everything.\n\nOther buildings near Batista\u2019s workshop have been abandoned\n\nHe decided to plant bamboo to try to slow the erosion. But given the scale of\nthe problem, Buriticupu needs much bigger solutions.\n\n## What can be done?\n\nHowever, with the right engineering and investment, \u201call of this is\nstoppable\u201d, says Prof Vanmaercke.\n\nTo stop gully erosion, cities have to build proper drainage systems to control\nthe flow of rainwater and run-off, explains Prof Poesen, to divert water away\nfrom areas vulnerable to gullies.\n\nThe Santos Dumont gully in Buriticupu has expanded over the past 10 years\n\nBut these schemes cost money in cities where budgets are tight.\n\nThe public prosecutor\u2019s office for Maranh\u00e3o state is taking legal action\nagainst the city of Buriticupu, saying it has not carried out plans that had\nbeen agreed.\n\nBuriticupu\u2019s Mayor Jo\u00e3o Teixeira da Silva declined to comment on the case but\nsays he has requested financial help from the federal government to fund work\nto divert the flow of rainwater.\n\nThe national government told us it was considering whether to release 300m\nBrazilian reals ($60m; \u00a347m) for Buriticupu. It added that it has already\nprovided 629,000 reals ($125,000; \u00a3100,000) to build a canal and storm drain,\nrestore local roads and demolish 89 houses.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment says that it has a programme to implement\n\u201cresilient systems in cities\u201d, but that it is not currently doing anything in\nBuriticupu.\n\n\u201cThese are complex works, works that require large resources,\u201d says the mayor.\n\u201cWhat we need is responsibility, both at the municipal, state and federal\nlevels.\u201d\n\nBut Jo\u00e3o Batista is aware that if the gully behind his workshop grows, he may\nhave to move.\n\n\u201cThis is nature telling us that if we don't look after our planet, it will be\ndestroyed. If it keeps raining like this, then we are in God\u2019s hands because\nthere's nothing we can do.\u201d\n\n## Credits\n\nReporting: Shin Suzuki\n\nAditional reporting: Stephanie Hegarty and Emery Makumeno\n\nEditors: Carol Olona, Tamara Gil and Alison Gee\n\nDesign: Caroline Souza\n\n3D model: Daniel Arce L\u00f3pez\n\nDevelopment: Matthew Taylor, Marta Mart\u00ed and Simon Frampton\n\nProject management: Holly Frampton and Carol Olona\n\nField producer: Paul Ivan Harris\n\nPhotography: Vitor Serrano, Dareck Tuba and Alex Huguet/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAdditional sources: Antonio Guerra, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro;\nFernando Bezerra, Universidade Estadual do Maranh\u00e3o; Gilberto Salviano Almeida\nFilho and Claudio Luiz Ridente Gomes, Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnol\u00f3gicas;\nMarco Ant\u00f4nio Gomes and Helena Filizola, Embrapa; Ryan Anderson, University of\nSouth Africa.
