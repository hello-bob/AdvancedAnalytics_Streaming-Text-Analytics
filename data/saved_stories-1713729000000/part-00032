His unparalleled legacy,\nepitomised by the discovery of the Higgs boson, continues to profoundly shape\nthe future of particle physics like no other discovery before it. This is the\nstory of his legacy.\n\nWhen Higgs was born in 1929, our understanding of matter was completely\ndifferent. Physicists had developed a simple model of matter with three\nfundamental, or elementary, particles (those that can\u2019t be broken down into\nsmaller particles).\n\nThese were protons, which exist in the nuclei of atoms, electrons, which\nsurround the protons and photons, packets of light that are responsible for a\nforce of nature called the electromagnetic force.\n\nDuring Higgs\u2019 lifetime, an astonishing revolution would unfold, culminating in\nthe creation of the Standard Model of particle physics, the most successful\nframework for understanding the building blocks of the universe in history.\n\nHiggs would supply the heart to this theory. To understand the significance of\nHiggs\u2019 work, it is necessary to understand the puzzle that nature laid out for\nphysicists, beginning with the discovery of the neutron in 1932.\n\nThe neutron is a sub-atomic particle, a neutral partner of the proton, but\nslightly heavier. If ripped out of the atomic nucleus, a neutron decays into a\nproton and an electron in about ten minutes.\n\nExplaining this decay required a new force and particle to mediate it (known\nas a force carrier). The new force carrier had to be many times heavier than\nboth the neutron and proton, which the prevalent theory couldn\u2019t explain.\n\nAccording to this theory, force carriers had to be massless. This was the case\nfor the force carrier for the electromagnetic force, the photon. Physicists\ncall this feature of the theory a symmetry.\n\nIn physics, theories with more symmetry have fewer free parameters \u2013 fewer\nparts of the theory that can be changed. An additional parameter, such as the\nmass for a force carrier, would make the theory inconsistent.\n\nPhysicists knew that some particles had mass, but could not explain it. They\nneeded to find the right way to break, or overcome, the symmetry in this\ntheory, giving particles mass in a way that was compatible with everything\nknown about the laws of nature. At the time Higgs began working on his ideas\nin the 1960s, the question of how elementary particles acquired mass was a\ncentral issue in physics.\n\nPeter Higgs shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work. Henrik\nMontgomery / Shutterstock\n\nIn the early 1960s, the American physicist Phil Anderson noticed that the\nproblematic symmetry in this theory could be overcome in superconductors (a\nmaterial that conducts electricity with zero resistance) or in charged gas\ncalled plasma. However, for a theory that should explain mass, a viable\nsolution couldn\u2019t depend on a specific medium or material.\n\nLater, Higgs and other theorists developed a model that overcame this\ndifficulty. The others physicists were Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen, Tom\nKibble, Robert Brout and Fran\u00e7ois Englert. Englert would go on to share the\n2013 Nobel prize in physics with Higgs.\n\nThe idea was simple in retrospect: a background field permeates all of space,\ncreating the kind of medium for which Anderson\u2019s idea worked. Higgs published\nhis first paper on the topic in 1964. In 1966, he was first to predict that\nthis \u201cHiggs field\u201d must also come with a \u201cHiggs particle\u201d. If discovered, it\nwould prove that the Standard Model was a consistent theory of nature.\n\nYet the search for the Higgs boson turned out to be extraordinarily\nchallenging. Higgs himself thought the question would not be settled in his\nlifetime. It took almost 50 years and the largest experiment ever built, the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, to finally discover the Higgs boson. On\nJuly 4 2012, images of Higgs, moved to tears by the announcement, went around\nthe world.\n\nThe Standard Model of particle physics. Alionaprof / Shutterstock\n\nOur universe is fundamentally shaped by the unique properties of the Higgs\nboson. Similar to the solid, liquid and gaseous states of matter, the Higgs\nfield corresponds to a phase of the universe that can be determined by\nmeasuring the way the Higgs boson interacts with other particles.\n\nIn the decade since its discovery, many of these interactions have been\nobserved at the LHC. These results have raised new questions. The stability of\nthe universe \u2013 its ability to persist in its present state more or less\nforever \u2014 seems to depend on the mass and interactions of the Higgs boson.\n\nIf current measurements of that particle are correct, the universe isn\u2019t\nstable in its current state. This means that it could eventually undergo a\ntransition to another form. The answers we uncover to this question could\nprove the Standard Model wrong.\n\nPhysicists also want to answer whether the Higgs field really explains all the\nmasses of elementary particles as predicted by the Standard Model. For many\nHiggs bosons produced at the LHC, we can\u2019t figure out what other particles\nthey decay into. If we could, we could test more speculative theories linked\nto dark matter or other theories beyond the Standard Model.\n\nTo answer these questions, Europe, the US and China have proposed plans for\nbuilding new particle colliders focused on studying the Higgs boson. Higgs\u2019\nlegacy will be the experimental particle physics programme of the 21st\ncentury.\n\nHiggs was a physicist from a different era. It would be unthinkable now for\nsomeone with his publication record to hang on in academia. He published only\na handful of papers, almost all of which were authored by him alone. Today\u2019s\nacademic culture creates fierce competition and pressure to publish\nfrequently.\n\nHiggs acknowledged this in a 2013 interview: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine how I\nwould ever have enough peace and quiet in the present sort of climate to do\nwhat I did in 1964... Today I wouldn\u2019t get an academic job... I don\u2019t think I\nwould be regarded as productive enough.\u201d\n\nThis should be considered a warning. Breakthroughs require time to read and\nstudy work in other fields, such as the time Higgs spent to understand\nAnderson\u2019s work. They require universities to create environments that\nprioritise time for research, rather than placing researchers in precarious\npositions dependant on the constant pursuit of grant funding.\n\nIt would be entirely fitting if Peter Higgs\u2019 legacy, which transformed our\nunderstanding of particle physics, also transformed our approach to research.\n\n  * Physics\n  * Large Hadron Collider\n  * Higgs boson\n  * CERN\n  * Science\n  * Standard model of particle physics\n  * Particle physics\n  * Peter Higgs\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Senior Disability Services Advisor\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\n  * ##### GRAINS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CHAIRPERSON\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
