Key to\ncapitalizing on such solutions is the public\u2019s trust and willingness to grant\ninfluence to scientists in shaping policy. However, previous research on\ndeterminants of trust is limited and does not factor in the diversity of\nscientific occupations. The present study (N = 2,780; U.S. participants)\ninvestigated how four well-established dimensions of social evaluations\n(competence, assertiveness, morality, warmth) shape trust in 45 types of\nscientists (from agronomists to zoologists). Trust in most scientists was\nrelatively high but varied considerably across occupations. Perceptions of\nmorality and competence emerged as the most important antecedents of trust, in\nturn predicting the willingness to grant scientists influence in managing\nsocietal problems. Importantly, the contribution of morality (but not\ncompetence) varied across occupations: Morality was most strongly associated\nwith trust in scientists who work on contentious and polarized issues (e.g.,\nclimatologists). Therefore, the diversity of scientific occupations must be\ntaken into account to more precisely map trust, which is important for\nunderstanding when scientific solutions find their way to policy.\n\n## Figures\n\nCitation: Gligori\u0107 V, van Kleef GA, Rutjens BT (2024) How social evaluations\nshape trust in 45 types of scientists.

However, trust in scientists is brittle. For example,\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic trust in science and scientists has been\ndocumented to have decreased in several countries, including France, Italy,\nand the US [1, 2]. But also before the pandemic trust levels left much to be\ndesired: In 2018, only 18% of the world population reported high levels of\ntrust in scientists [3]. Given that trust in scientists is one of the key\npredictors of positive attitudes and compliance with science-based\nrecommendations (e.g., vaccination [1] or pro-environmental behavior [4, 5]),\ninsights into how trust in scientists is shaped and can be enhanced are\ncrucial. However, the current understanding of trust in scientists is hampered\nby the implicit assumption that all scientific occupations are the same. This\nstate of affairs hinders the successful implementation of science-based\nsolutions to societal challenges. In the present research, we address this\nproblem by investigating how trust is shaped by social evaluations across 45\nscientific occupations, as well as how these social evaluations subsequently\nshape willingness to grant scientists influence in managing societal problems.\n\n### Diversity of scientific occupations\n\nScience is not a monolithic enterprise: It consists of a plethora of\ndisciplines that each comes with its own goals, values, and approaches. It is\nconceivable, then, that perceptions of scientists and trust in scientists\ndiffer across scientific occupations. Indeed, previous research shows that the\nterm \u201cscientist\u201d is an overgeneralization. In a systematic investigation of\nsocial evaluations of more than 30 scientific occupations in the US and the\nUK, Gligori\u0107 and colleagues (2022) found that people perceive meaningful\ndifferences between different scientific occupations [6]. For example,\nsociologists were regarded as less competent than neuroscientists, whereas\nzoologists and related occupations were seen as the most moral and sociable.\nThese differences in social evaluations could be empirically captured in\nclusters (e.g., biomedical scientists, data scientists). Similarly,\nAltenm\u00fcller and colleagues (2024) showed that scientific occupations also\ndiffer in perceptions along the ideological line of liberalism-conservatism,\nso that some occupations (e.g., sociologists, climate scientists) are seen as\nmore liberal than others (e.g., mathematicians, chemists) [7]. Trust, too,\nvaries across different types of scientists: For example, people hold more\npositive perceptions of publicly (vs. privately) funded scientists [8], and\nsome scientists work on issues that are caught in the crosshairs of heavily\npoliticised public debate (e.g., climate science, vaccination), which can\ntrigger science scepticism [9].\n\nCrucially, how this diversity translates to trust in scientists is to date\nunknown. This is because most research investigating scientist perceptions has\nfocused on the generic term \u201cscientists\u201d. Some exceptions are disparate\nstudies of one or two specific groups or categories, such as scientists\nworking on genetic modification (GM) [10], chemists and biologists [11], and\nmathematicians [12]. To date, however, no systematic comparison of trust in\ndifferent types of scientists has been conducted. This is problematic because\nit remains unknown whether interventions aimed at increasing trust should be\ntailored to specific (groups of) scientists or scientists in general.\n\n### Trust in scientists\n\n#### Social evaluations as antecedents of trust.\n\nWhat are the factors that contribute to trust in scientists? Some researchers\npoint to the importance of social evaluations. Notably, Fiske and Dupree\n(2014) suggested that even though scientists are seen as competent, their\nperceived lack of warmth might contribute to lower trust [13]. This work is\nbased on the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM; [14]), which\nposits two social evaluation dimensions\u2013competence and warmth. Although SCM is\none of the best-known social evaluation models, other models proposed\ndifferent structures of social judgment, arguing for separation of morality\nand warmth (e.g., politicians can be perceived as friendly, but immoral;\n[15\u201317]), separation of competence (capability) and assertiveness (confidence)\n[15], or even adding a new dimension (conservative-progressive beliefs) [18].\nIn a recent adversarial collaboration, researchers who posited five different\nsocial evaluation models attempted to integrate these models [19\u201321]. Their\nintegration suggested that further division of the Big Two factors\n(Agency/Vertical dimension and Communion/Horizontal dimension) into four\nfacets (competence and assertiveness; morality and warmth) is the most\nappropriate structure of social judgment [19\u201321]. Such distinctions showed to\nbe useful for understanding evaluations of scientists as well, given that\nresearch has shown that scientists are not only seen as very competent\n(intelligent, smart), but are also perceived as more moral than warm, as well\nas more competent than assertive [6, 22]. However, although social evaluation\nmodels are a promising path to increasing understanding of trust in scientists\n[13], to our knowledge, no research has directly tested how social evaluations\nof groups subsequently relate to trust. In other words, work so far leaves the\nquestion of how well-established social evaluations of scientists shape levels\nof trust in them. Additionally, as mentioned before, it is unknown whether the\nrole of social evaluations in trust varies across occupations.\n\nAnother, somewhat related, strand of research on trust (in scientists) comes\nfrom organizational psychology, which suggests that trust is composed of three\ncomponents: ability (skill, expertise), benevolence (self-interest vs societal\nbenefits), and integrity (fairness and honesty) [23]. Trust in scientists\ncould be, in principle, somewhat different as laypeople are unable to\nunderstand different scientific information without specialized knowledge in\nthat area. Yet, the three-component model of trust has also shown to be\napplicable within the context of scientists: Hendriks and colleagues (2015)\nfound that scientists were evaluated on these three dimensions [24]. More\nrecently, it has been suggested that the factor of \u201copenness\u201d should be added\nas a fourth component of trust in scientists [10]. However, due to high\nintercorrelations between components, neither study tested the relative\ncontribution of these dimensions to trust. These intercorrelations are\nexpected (and inevitable) given that they are seen as trust components (parts\nof trust), rather than factors influencing trust. With this in mind, the\ncurrent work focused on social evaluations as predictors, because they 1) are\nmore clearly conceptualized in the literature, 2) show lower\nintercorrelations, and 3) potentially shape trust, rather than merely\nrepresenting components of trust. Importantly, we did not focus solely on\ntrust ratings, but we also included the consequence of trust, which we\noperationalized using a novel influence granting task (see pilot studies).\n\n### The present study\n\nIn the present study, we investigated trust in many different groups of\nscientists. Specifically, we tested whether and how four theoretical social\nevaluation dimensions (competence, assertiveness, morality, warmth; [19, 25])\ncontribute to trust across 45 different scientific occupations. Moreover, we\nexamined how trust in turn shapes the willingness to grant scientists\ninfluence on the management of complex societal problems, by including a novel\ninfluence granting task (details about pilot studies conducted to develop this\ntask can be found in the S1 File). Incorporating this task enabled us to\ninvestigate not only the influence of social evaluations on trust perceptions,\nbut also to assess the downstream consequences of these perceptions in a more\necologically valid way.\n\n## Method\n\n### Participants\n\nAs pre-registered, we aimed to collect data from 2813 participants. This\nsample size was determined based on the notion that correlations stabilize at\naround 250 participants [26]. Since each participant rated four (out of 45)\noccupations (see procedure), we needed 2813 participants (= 250*45/4) so that\neach occupation would obtain ratings from approximately 250 participants. To\naccount for anticipated exclusions (see below), we sampled 3246 participants\nfrom Prolific, selecting only US participants whose minimum approval rate was\n95/100. Participation took around 10 minutes, and participants were paid \u00a31.05\n(approx. $1.16 or \u20ac1.20). As pre-registered, we excluded participants who\nfailed an attention check question (n = 334), speeders (twice faster than the\nmedian of 610 seconds; n = 82), and multivariate outliers (Mahalanobis\ndistance on each item of the dependent variable, n = 50), which left us with a\nfinal sample of N = 2780 (1333 men, 1382 women, 65 indicated \u201cother\u201d; M_age =\n39.03, SD_age = 14.93). Regarding education, 0.7% indicated education less\nthan high school, 25.3% had completed high school, 12.7% were students, 42.3%\nhad an undergraduate degree, and 19.1% had a graduate degree. The sample was\nslightly liberal (M = 3.07; SD = 1.76; range 1\u20137) and somewhat religious (M =\n3.03; SD = 2.09; range 1\u20137). No analyses were performed before data exclusion.\n\n### Procedure and materials\n\nEthical approval was obtained at the authors\u2019 university. We report all\nmeasures used in the study. After reading the information letter and signing\nthe consent form, participants reported their demographics, political\norientation, and religiosity. Next, each participant was asked to rate four\nscientific occupations on several attributes. The four occupations were\nrandomly selected out of 45 occupations. The list of 45 scientific occupations\nwas obtained from the previous study in which US participants were asked to\ngenerate as many scientific occupations as they could [6]. After rating one\nscientific occupation, participants moved to the next one, until they had\nrated four.\n\nFirst, participants rated an occupation on four social evaluation dimensions\nwhich were presented on four separate pages (the order of dimensions was\nrandomized). The four dimensions were competence, assertiveness, morality, and\nwarmth [19]. Each dimension was measured with five items on a 7-point (from -3\nto 3) bipolar scale [15, 27]. Examples of items for competence included pairs\nsuch as \u201cincompetent\u2013competent\u201d and \u201cunintelligent\u2013intelligent\u201d, and items for\nassertiveness included pairs such as \u201chas no leadership skills at all\u2013has\nleadership skills\u201d and \u201cunconfident\u2013confident\u201d. Morality was assessed with\npairs such as \u201cunjust\u2013just\u201d and \u201cunfair\u2013fair\u201d, while warmth included pairs\nlike \u201ccold\u2013warm\u201d and \u201cuncaring\u2013caring\u201d. Reliabilities for all four dimensions\nwere high: Median Cronbach\u2019s alphas were \u03b1 = .92 (range .80 \u2013.95), \u03b1 = .87\n(range .83 \u2013.91), \u03b1 = .93 (range .88 \u2013.96), and \u03b1 = .94 (range .93 \u2013.96) for\ncompetence, assertiveness, morality, and warmth respectively. All items\nmeasuring each dimension, as well as their intercorrelations, are given in the\nS1 Fig in S1 File.\n\nAfter rating an occupation on the social evaluation scales, trust was measured\nusing the following item: \u201cHow much do you trust [occupation]?\u201d (1 = do not\ntrust at all to 7 = trust completely) [1]. We opted for this approach to\nmeasure trust for several reasons. First, various large-scale research studies\nhave used this operationalization [1, 3], which predicts a range of\nbehaviors[28, 29] and allows participants to construct their own meaning of\ntrust, rather than researchers imposing theirs. Second, a one-item measure has\nbeen shown to function well as a substitute for a multi-item measure of trust\n[30]. Third, our pilot studies, which included both one-item and a more\nspecific four-item [31] measures of trust, indicate that these correlate\nstrongly (median Pearson\u2019s r = .74 across different occupations and pilot\nstudies). Finally, a single-item measure is cost-effective, which was of\nimportance given the large number of participants and occupations in the\nstudy.\n\nNext, participants completed the influence granting task (IGT)\u2014a novel task\nthat we designed to measure the willingness to grant scientists influence on\nmanaging societal problems (see the S1 File for pilot studies in which we pre-\ntested the task). We presented participants with the following scenario:\n\n> Imagine there is a pressing problem in your country that is affecting every\n> citizen. You have the complete power to make a decision about how to solve\n> the problem. This problem is very complex and, therefore, to solve it, the\n> help and advice of various types of scientists would be useful. If you were\n> to make a final decision, how strongly would you value the input of the\n> following parties? Note that points must sum up to 100.\n\nParticipants were then instructed to use sliders to distribute 100 points of\ndecision power to different parties. The points had to total 100 (constant sum\ntype of question), and participants distributed them to seven different\nparties which were shown in a randomized order: community leaders,\npoliticians, citizens, friends, family, themselves, and the scientific\noccupation at hand. Given that we wanted to allow for comparisons of effects\nbetween different scientific occupations, we developed one scenario for all\noccupations. The rationale for this task was that granting influence can be\nunderstood as one of the key trusting behaviors, in that people are more\nwilling to confer decision-making power to individuals or institutions they\ntrust [23, 32\u201334]. On average (across all scientific occupations),\nparticipants distributed the points in the following descending order:\nscientists (25.5), citizens (18.1), community leaders (16.9), themselves\n(16.6), friends (8.0), politicians (7.5), family (7.3).\n\nAfter rating four occupations, participants were presented with an attention\ncheck question which was similar to the IGT and was phrased in the following\nway: \u201cImagine there is a pressing problem in your country that is affecting\nevery citizen. Note that this question is an attention-check question. Please\nselect the option myself and move it [the slider] to the maximum.\u201d Next,\nparticipants were asked to report how attentive they were (1 = not very\nattentive to 5 = extremely attentive). Failing either of the attention checks\nwarranted exclusion (for the second question, answering \u201cnot very attentive\u201d\nwas considered an attention check failure). Finally, we asked participants to\nindicate if they knew all occupations they were asked to rate (2465 reported\nthey knew all occupations, 315 indicated they did not). The results remained\nunchanged when analyses were conducted with data from only participants who\nreported knowing all occupations (n = 2465). Note that testing the robustness\nof results after excluding participants who did not know occupations was not\npre-registered.\n\n## Results\n\nAll reported analyses were pre-registered unless stated otherwise. Before\nanswering our research questions on the relationship between social\nevaluations and trust, we first calculated ratings of competence,\nassertiveness, morality, warmth, trust, and IGT for each occupation. Ratings\nwere estimated from a mixed model which included a random intercept for\nparticipants because each participant rated only 4 (out of 45) occupations.\nThe table of ratings by occupation is given in Table 1. Overall, scientists\nevoked positive perceptions given that all social evaluations and trust\nratings were above the mid-point of the scales (though note that political\nscientists and economists evoked noticeably lower ratings of morality and\ntrust compared to other occupations).\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nTable 1. Social evaluations, trust, and IGT ratings of scientific occupations\nin the study with standard errors in the brackets.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299621.t001\n\nAs per a reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we compared the fit of two models of social\nevaluations (non-preregistered analyses): one with the four-factor (the one we\ncurrently use) and one with the two-factor (agency/communion) solution. Only\nthe four-factor solution showed good fit (CFI = 0.946, TLI = .937, RMSEA =\n.077, SRMR = .052, AIC = 444328, BIC = 444811), but not the two-factor one\n(CFI = 0.748, TLI = .717, RMSEA = .163, SRMR = .140, AIC = 483346, BIC =\n483792). Comparing the models showed that the four-factor solution was\nsignificantly better (\u03c72diff(5) = 9592.5, p < .001).\n\n### Social evaluations predicting trust and influence granting\n\nSince participants rated different occupations (ratings were nested in\nparticipants and occupations), multilevel analyses were required. Before\nconducting analyses, we performed mean-centering within clusters\n(occupations), to disaggregate between and within effects, and focused only on\nthe latter. We also standardized all variables to facilitate the\ninterpretation of the coefficients and enable comparing effects in predicting\ntrust and influence granting. The correlation between the variables is given\nin Table 2.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nTable 2. Correlations between scientists\u2019 evaluation variables, trust, and\ninfluence granting (IGT).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299621.t002\n\nWe ran a multilevel model to investigate how social evaluations relate to\ntrust. Because trust levels could be different for different participants and\ndifferent occupations, we first ran a model with a random intercept for\nparticipants and occupations, and fixed effects for social evaluation\nmeasures. The results are given in Table 3 (left). There are several things to\nnote. First, morality seems to play the most important role in shaping trust\nperceptions, followed by competence. Assertiveness and warmth also\ncontributed, but to a smaller extent. Regarding random effects, random\nintercepts suggest that trust levels varied across participants and across\noccupations. The full random intercept model (AIC = 21329) showed better fit\nthan the models without a random intercept for either participants or\noccupations (AIC = 24065, LRT(1) = 2738.3, p < .001 and AIC = 23312, LRT(1) =\n1984.8, p < .001 respectively), indicating that trust levels were indeed\ndifferent across participants and occupations.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nTable 3.

We did so by creating a model that allowed slopes for\neach of the social evaluation dimensions to vary across occupations. Fixed\neffects remained relatively unchanged, with variances of slopes being .001 for\ncompetence, .000 for assertiveness, .009 for morality, and .003 for warmth.\nComparing models with and without random effects for each social evaluations\ndimension showed that the effects of competence and assertiveness on trust did\nnot vary across occupations (LRTs(5) < 9.02, ps > .10), while the effect of\nmorality (LRT(5) = 69.43, p < .001) and warmth (LRT(5) = 20.85, p < .001) did.\nA visual representation of the effects of social dimensions predicting trust\nacross occupations is provided in Fig 1(A) and 1(B). In short, results suggest\nthat the effects of competence and assertiveness predicting trust did not vary\nacross scientific occupations, whereas the effects of morality and warmth did.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 1.\n\nA.

The estimates vary\nacross different occupations.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299621.g001\n\nNext, we conducted the same analysis with the IGT as the dependent variable.\nAgain, morality and competence were found to be more important than warmth and\nassertiveness, although the difference between their respective importance is\nnoticeably smaller compared to the effects predicting trust (Table 3, right).\nAs with trust, model comparisons indicated that IGT levels varied across\nparticipants and occupations: A full random intercept model (AIC = 21330)\nshowed a better fit than models without either a random intercept for\nparticipants or occupations (AIC = 30367, LRT(1) = 7049.1, p < .001 and AIC =\n24182, LRT(1) = 864.6, p < .001 respectively). To investigate the random\neffects of social evaluation dimensions predicting IGT, we applied the same\nstrategy as for trust. Again, fixed coefficients remained the same, with\nvariances of slopes being .002 for competence, .002 for assertiveness, .002\nfor morality, and .002 for warmth. Comparing models with and without random\neffects for each social evaluations dimension indicated that the effects of\ncompetence (LRT(5) = 12.8, p = .03), assertiveness (LRT(5) = 17.0, p < .01),\nand warmth on IGT (LRT(5) = 12.5, p = .03), but not morality (LRT(5) = 10.0, p\n= .07) varied across occupations. Given the low variances and marginal p\nvalues, these results did not decisively show whether including random effects\nis warranted. We, therefore, investigated the AIC of the models when each of\nthe random slopes was dropped. These models had either equal or higher AIC\nthan the baseline model with no random slopes (AIC = 23271). For this reason,\nwe opted for selecting the simpler model, i.e., without random effects. A\nvisual representation of the effects of social evaluations predicting IGT\nacross occupations, which is provided in the S2 and S3 Figs in S1 File, also\nsupported this decision. In short, these analyses show that the impact of\nsocial evaluation dimensions (competence, assertiveness, morality, warmth) on\ninfluence granting did not depend on occupation, unlike what was observed for\ntrust ratings. This suggests that, for example, perceptions of morality have\nthe same impact on willingness to grant scientists influence, regardless of\nthe scientific occupation in question. Note that all analyses above retained\nthe same pattern when the morality dimension was calculated excluding the\n\u201ctrustworthy\u201d adjective due to semantic overlap (fully reported in the S1\nFile).\n\n### Trust as a mediator of the effect of social evaluations on influence\ngranting\n\nFinally, we tested if trust mediates the effect of social evaluations\npredicting influence granting. To do so, we conducted a multilevel mediation\nanalysis. This analysis allowed us to test whether trust mediates the\nrelationship on average (ignoring different occupations), and how this\nindirect effect varies across different occupations. The coefficients were\nestimated from two regression models (first: social evaluations predicting\ntrust; second: social evaluations and trust predicting IGT) which included a\nrandom intercept for participants and occupations and fixed effects of social\nevaluations. The significance of indirect effects (all significant, p < .001)\nwas tested using bootstrapping (estimating the model 1000 times). Effects\naveraged across occupations are given in Fig 2. As evident from the figure,\nthe effects of competence, assertiveness, and morality were partially mediated\nby trust, while warmth did not have a total effect in the first place.\nMediation proportions (the ratio of the total effect that is accounted by the\nmediating variable) of competence, assertiveness, and morality effects were\n42%, 14%, and 73% respectively. Random effects by occupation can be found in\nthe S1 File.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 2. The effect of social evaluations predicting influence granting via\ntrust.\n\nThe model is averaged across occupations and participants with random\nintercepts for both factors. Trust partially mediated the effects of\ncompetence, assertiveness and morality. Significant paths are marked with\nthree asterisks (***p < .001). Direct effects are given within brackets.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299621.g002\n\nWe ran all the analyses above (non-preregistered) using only the big two\nfactors\u2013agency (calculated as an average of competence and assertiveness) and\ncommunion (calculated as an average of warmth and morality). This showed that\nboth big factors contributed to predicting trust which mediated the effect on\ninfluence granting (S4 and S5 Figs in S1 File). Importantly, comparing the\nresults of analyses with two vs. four factors allowed us to discern which\nparts of the agency and communion contribute to trust (competence and\nmorality) and which do not (assertiveness and warmth).\n\n## Discussion\n\nResearch on trust in scientists\u2014arguably a key prerequisite for public\nacceptance of science-based solutions\u2014is limited because it routinely treats\nscientific occupations as homogenous. The present study is, to our knowledge,\nthe first to systematically investigate the antecedents of trust in scientists\nacross a wide range of science domains. More specifically, we investigated how\nsocial evaluations shape trust as well as the willingness to grant scientists\ninfluence in managing societal problems. We found that trust in scientists was\nrelatively high, with all occupations scoring above the mid-point. However,\nsome scientists were trusted more than others. We discovered that perceptions\nof competence and morality play a prominent role in shaping trust ratings,\nmore so than perceptions of assertiveness and warmth. Importantly, whereas the\neffect of competence was uniform, the effect of morality varied across\noccupations\u2013morality was more strongly associated with trust in occupations\nworking on contentious, publicly debated topics (see below).\n\nThe prominent role of competence and morality in trust suggests that trust in\nscientists has two requirements: Although a scientist must be knowledgeable\nand competent, this competence must be paired with good intentions (i.e., the\nscientist needs to be perceived as moral). Both ingredients are necessary to\nbuild a trustworthy scientist: Scientists would not be seen as scientists if\nthey were perceived as incompetent [6, 13, 22], while morality is arguably the\nmost important predictor of trust [10, 24]. Whereas Fiske and Dupre (2014)\nsuggested that the perception of warmth (in terms of the two-dimensional SCM)\nis important for trust in scientists [13], our study advances this notion by\nshowing that this particularly applies to morality, and not warmth. It is also\nnoteworthy that competence (vs. assertiveness) and morality (vs. warmth) as\nstrongest predictors are more stable and central to one\u2019s character as they\nrefer to perception how people are (vs. how they behave/seem) [27].\n\nTrust in scientists is likely different from trust in other social and\noccupational categories. A key defining characteristic of scientists is\ncompetence [6] and much of the work that scientists do is not fully\ncomprehensible to laypeople, who therefore will have to rely on scientists\u2019\ncompetence and their good intentions. However, trust in other groups might\nshow different patterns. Indeed, research conducted within the SCM framework\nshows that trust in negotiators [35] and strangers [36] is determined by\nwarmth, but not competence. Similarly, perceived morality (vs competence) is\nmore important in cases such as group acceptance and rejection [37], and group\nevaluations [17]. Overall, this suggests that competence will contribute to\ntrust when it is particularly relevant for an outcome, as is the case with\nscientists (e.g., discovering a drug to combat cancer depends on medical\nresearchers\u2019 skills and knowledge).\n\nImportantly, our study provides evidence that not all social evaluations shape\ntrust in the same way for different occupations. Whereas competence similarly\nshaped trust regardless of scientific occupation, morality did not. Why would\nperceptions of morality have a weaker effect on trust for some occupations,\nbut a stronger effect for others? This might be because certain groups of\nscientists work on more contentious and polarized issues. For instance, some\nof the occupations for which morality most strongly influenced trust were\nthose in climate science and politico-economic research. This finding aligns\nwith the idea that many science attitudes are rooted in ideologies,\nidentities, and other motivational factors [38, 39]. Additionally, some\nbranches of science involve larger moral implications, as evidenced by public\ndiscussions about various scientific topics. This certainly applies to climate\nscience [40, 41], nuclear physics [42], political science, and\u2014especially\nsince 2020\u2014virology [43]. Whenever science is seen as especially relevant to\npeople\u2019s lives, the perceived morality of the scientists involved arguably\nmatters more, which is what the current data seem to support.\n\nIt is, however, important to note two differences when using social\nevaluations to predict trust perceptions, as compared to predicting the\nInfluence Granting Task. First, the effect sizes were stronger when predicting\ntrust perceptions. Second, for trust perceptions (but not IGT), the effect of\nmorality perceptions varied across scientific occupations. We believe these\ndifferences emerged because social evaluations more closely matched trust\nperceptions in that both can be seen as attitudinal measures, whereas the IGT\nis a more behavioral measure (behavioral willingness). Another likely reason\nis common-method variance: seven-point scales were used to measure social\nevaluations and trust perceptions, but not for responses on the IGT. Finally,\nin responding to the IGT, factors other than trust might have influenced the\nresponses (e.g., certain personality traits could drive participants more\ntowards the option \u201cmyself\u201d; individuals that have stronger ties with family\ncould prefer the family option, etc.).\n\n### Limitations, future research, and conclusion\n\nOur study is not without limitations. Firstly, our measure of trust perception\nis short (one item) and might have seemed somewhat general to participants.\nNevertheless, this approach to measuring trust is relatively common in\nresearch on trust in scientists [1, 3] as it provides a cost-effective way to\ncapture key perceptions. Future research could put more focus on what trust in\nscientists entails, as well as on finding valid ways to investigate its\nconsequences. Similarly, the utilized influence-granting measure may have come\nacross as somewhat artificial, as the problem was unnamed, and participants\nwere offered to grant influence to only one type of scientist. Therefore,\nparticipants might have had more specific problems in mind (e.g., climate\nchange, COVID-19) when responding. However, it would be very difficult to come\nup with particular scenarios appropriate for each scientific occupation,\nespecially given potential confounds. By keeping the phrasing of the question\nidentical, we avoided this problem and were able to make comparisons across\ndifferent occupations. Future research might benefit from utilizing a measure\ngauging the consequences of trust that is further improved on ecological\nvalidity, for example by assessing real-world behavior in specific domains.\nAnother limitation of the study is that it utilized US participants, so the\ngeneralizability of the roles of competence and morality remains to be tested.\nTesting whether these results apply to other countries could be one avenue for\nfuture research. Finally, given the correlational nature of our study, a\nfruitful next step would be to experimentally assess the (relative) impact of\ncompetence and morality on trust and its consequences across scientific\noccupations, which would also pave the way for potential interventions (e.g.,\nemphasizing scientists\u2019 good intentions in science communication).\n\nIn conclusion, the current work shows that trust in scientists varies\nconsiderably across occupations. Across 45 scientific occupations, trust was\nlargely based on how competent and moral people perceived a scientist to be.\nThe importance of morality was, however, not uniform across domains. For\nexample, morality was not as important for trust in geographers as it was for\ntrust in pharmacologists. These findings demonstrate that it is important to\nconsider the diversity of scientific occupations when investigating trust and\nits contributing factors and the willingness to grant scientists influence in\nengaging with societal problems and policymaking.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nPilot studies.\n\n### S1 File.
