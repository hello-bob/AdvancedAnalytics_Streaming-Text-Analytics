Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Why do most mammals have 5 fingers?\n\nNews\n\nBy Katherine Irving\n\npublished 8 hours ago\n\nThe simple question of \"why five\" has puzzled scientists from multiple fields,\nand the answer still isn't entirely clear.\n\nHumans, dogs, cats and many other mammals share the same five-finger pattern\non our front limbs (Image credit: Getty Images / Sergey Ryumin)\n\nIf you look at the paws of a cat, a dog or even a kangaroo, you'll notice they\nhave something in common with our hands. Even if some might be shrunken or\ndifferently positioned, all of these mammals have five digits, or fingers. Why\ndo we share this pattern with our furry friends, even though we evolved under\ndifferent conditions?\n\nTo answer the question of why mammals have five fingers, we must first\nunderstand why tetrapod (Greek for \"four-footed\") vertebrates have five\nfingers. Mammals belong to the superclass Tetrapoda, which also includes\nreptiles, amphibians and birds. Even members of this group without traditional\nlimbs have five fingers in their skeleton \u2014 whales, seals and sea lions have\nfive fingers in their flippers \u2014 even if they have four or fewer toes.\n\nThere is some variation: Horses have just one toe, and birds have one fused\nfinger bone at the end of their wing. However, scientists have discovered that\nthese animals start out with as many as five fingers as embryos, but they\nshrink away before they are born.\n\nThis process is dictated largely by Hox genes, Thomas Stewart, an evolutionary\nbiologist at Penn State, told Live Science. Hox genes encode proteins that\nhelp regulate the activity of other genes, turning them on or off. They help\nensure that body parts end up in their correct location in an animal's body,\nas it develops from an embryo. As such, they're involved in dictating the\nskeletal pattern of tetrapods and do so by helping to control proteins created\nby the sonic hedgehog gene (yes, that's the real name) to activate and block\neach other while creating tissues.\n\nThrough this process, finger buds grow; depending on the type of animal, these\nbuds could either continue growing or reabsorb. Then, the cells around where\nthe fingers should be die, creating separate digits. Exactly how this happens\nis \"admittedly a pretty complicated problem,\" Stewart said. The details vary\ndepending on which scientist you ask.\n\nNobody is sure when this five-finger plan first evolved. The first known\nanimals to develop fingers evolved from fish around 360 million years ago and\nhad as many as eight fingers, Stewart said. However, the existence of the\nfive-finger plan in most living tetrapods indicates that the trait is likely a\n\"homology\" \u2014 a gene or structure that is shared between organisms because they\nhave a common ancestor. The common ancestor of all living tetrapods must have\nsomehow evolved to have five fingers and passed that pattern down to its\ndescendants.\n\nMammal forelimbs, including a human arm, lion forelimb, whale front flipper\nand bird wing.

One theory is canalization \u2014 the idea that over time, a gene or trait\nbecomes more stable and less likely to mutate. Stewart gave the example of\ncervical, or neck, vertebrae: Mammals almost always have seven of these\nvertebrae even though that number doesn't seem to offer a particular\nadvantage. If the number has worked for millions of years, there's no reason\nto change it, according to this theory.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRelated: Which animal species has existed the longest?\n\nHowever, not all researchers agree with the canalization idea. Kimberly\nCooper, a evolutionary developmental geneticist at the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego, points out that polydactyly, or having more than five\nfingers, occurs as a mutation in many mammals, including humans. There are\nmultiple mutations that can cause polydactyly, but a recent study published in\nthe journal Nature found that it can happen through the mutation of just one\nnucleotide in the sonic hedgehog gene.\n\nThe five-fingered paw of a koala.

Some\nspeculate it might be down to gene linkage: As genes evolve over millions of\nyears, some become linked, meaning changing one gene (the amount of fingers)\ncould lead to other more serious health issues. But as of yet, nobody has\noffered concrete proof, Stewart told Live Science.\n\n\"We can ask a very simple question of why don't we see more than five fingers,\nand it seems like we should arrive at a simple answer,\" he said. \"But it's a\nreally deep problem. That makes [this field] really exciting.\"\n\nKatherine Irving\n\nKatherine Irving is a freelance science journalist specializing in wildlife\nand the geosciences.
