Open Science practices include but\n> are not limited to the early sharing of results via preprints and openly\n> sharing outputs such as data and code to make research more reproducible and\n> extensible. Existing evidence shows that adopting Open Science practices has\n> effects in several domains. In this study, we investigate whether adopting\n> one or more Open Science practices leads to significantly higher citations\n> for an associated publication, which is one form of academic impact. We use\n> a novel dataset known as Open Science Indicators, produced by PLOS and\n> DataSeer, which includes all PLOS publications from 2018 to 2023 as well as\n> a comparison group sampled from the PMC Open Access Subset. In total, we\n> analyze circa 122'000 publications. We calculate publication and author-\n> level citation indicators and use a broad set of control variables to\n> isolate the effect of Open Science Indicators on received citations. We show\n> that Open Science practices are adopted to different degrees across\n> scientific disciplines. We find that the early release of a publication as a\n> preprint correlates with a significant positive citation advantage of about\n> 20.2% on average. We also find that sharing data in an online repository\n> correlates with a smaller yet still positive citation advantage of 4.3% on\n> average. However, we do not find a significant citation advantage for\n> sharing code. Further research is needed on additional or alternative\n> measures of impact beyond citations. Our results are likely to be of\n> interest to researchers, as well as publishers, research funders, and\n> policymakers.\n\nSubjects:| Digital Libraries (cs.DL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.16171 [cs.DL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.16171v1 [cs.DL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16171arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Giovanni Colavizza [view email] [v1] Wed, 24 Apr 2024 20:03:01 UTC\n(43,353 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled An analysis of the effects of sharing research\ndata, code, and preprints on citations, by Giovanni Colavizza and 6 other\nauthors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.DL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
