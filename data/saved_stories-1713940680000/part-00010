Here's\nwhat to know.\n\nBy Kate Gibson\n\nEdited By Alain Sherter\n\nUpdated on: April 23, 2024 / 4:39 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nBiden order could make it easier to quit\n\nBiden's latest executive order could make it easier for Americans to quit\ntheir jobs 06:45\n\nFederal regulators on Tuesday enacted a nationwide ban on new noncompete\nagreements, which keep millions of Americans \u2014 from minimum-wage earners to\nCEOs \u2014 from changing jobs within their industries.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday afternoon voted 3-to-2 to approve the\nnew rule, which will ban noncompetes for all workers when the regulations take\neffect in 120 days. For senior executives, existing noncompetes can remain in\nforce. For all other employees, existing noncompetes are not enforceable.\n\nThe antitrust and consumer protection agency heard from thousands of people\nwho said they had been harmed by noncompetes, illustrating how the agreements\nare \"robbing people of their economic liberty,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said.\n\nThe FTC commissioners voted along party lines, with its two Republicans\narguing the agency lacked the jurisdiction to enact the rule and that such\nmoves should be made in Congress.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nThe new rule could impact tens of millions of workers, said Heidi Shierholz, a\nlabor economist and president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning\nthink tank.\n\n\"For nonunion workers, the only leverage they have is their ability to quit\ntheir job,\" Shierholz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Noncompetes don't just stop you\nfrom taking a job \u2014 they stop you from starting your own business.\"\n\nSince proposing the new rule, the FTC has received more than 26,000 public\ncomments on the regulations. The final rule adopted \"would generally prevent\nmost employers from using noncompete clauses,\" the FTC said in a statement.\n\nThe agency's action comes more than two years after President Biden directed\nthe agency to \"curtail the unfair use\" of noncompetes, under which employees\neffectively sign away future work opportunities in their industry as a\ncondition of keeping their current job. The president's executive order urged\nthe FTC to target such labor restrictions and others that improperly constrain\nemployees from seeking work.\n\nStill, the rule is virtually certain to be challenged in court, with the U.S.\nChamber of Commerce in the past calling it \"blatantly unlawful. The trade\ngroup, which advocates for U.S. corporations and businesses, did not respond\nto a request for comment.\n\n\"The freedom to change jobs is core to economic liberty and to a competitive,\nthriving economy,\" Khan said in a statement making the case for axing\nnoncompetes. \"Noncompetes block workers from freely switching jobs, depriving\nthem of higher wages and better working conditions, and depriving businesses\nof a talent pool that they need to build and expand.\"\n\n## A threat to trade secrets?\n\nAn estimated 30 million people \u2014 or one in five U.S. workers \u2014 are bound by\nnoncompete restrictions, according to the FTC. The new rule could boost worker\nwages by a total of nearly $300 billion a year, according to the agency.\n\nEmployers who use noncompetes argue that they are needed to protect trade\nsecrets or other confidential information employees might learn in the course\nof their jobs. But corporations concerned about protecting their intellectual\nassets can use restraints such as confidentiality agreements and trade secret\nlaws, and don't need to resort to noncompete agreements, the FTC staff\ndetermined.\n\nThe commission's final rule does not nullify existing noncompetes with senior\nexecutives, who are defined as those earning more than $151,164 a year and who\nhold a policy-making position. Those execs are much more likely to negotiate\nthe terms of their compensation, according to regulators.\n\nStill, the FTC is banning new noncompetes for senior executives on the grounds\nthat the agreements stifle competition and discourage employees from creating\nnew businesses, potentially harming consumers.\n\nThe idea of using noncompetes to keep business information out of the hands of\nrivals has proliferated, noted Shierholz, citing a notorious case involving\nJimmy John's eateries.\n\nLow-paid workers are now the hardest hit by restrictive work agreements, which\ncan forbid employees including janitors, security guards and phlebotomists\nfrom leaving their job for better pay even though these entry-level workers\nare least likely to have access to trade secrets.\n\n## Real-life consequences\n\nIn laying out its rationale for banishing noncompetes from the labor\nlandscape, the FTC offered real-life examples of how the agreements can hurt\nworkers.\n\nIn one case, a single father earned about $11 an hour as a security guard for\na Florida firm, but resigned a few weeks after taking the job when his child\ncare fell through. Months later, he took a job as a security guard at a bank,\nmaking nearly $15 an hour. But the bank terminated his employment after\nreceiving a letter from the man's prior employer stating he had signed a two-\nyear noncompete.\n\nIn another example, a factory manager at a textile company saw his paycheck\ndry up after the 2008 financial crisis. A rival textile company offered him a\nbetter job and a big raise, but his noncompete blocked him from taking it,\naccording to the FTC. A subsequent legal battle took three years, wiping out\nhis savings.\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nCalifornia could ban Clear, which lets travelers pay to skip TSA lines\n\nA TikTok ban was passed by the House.
