Maruyama for Christmas last\nyear. It is one of the greatest presents I have ever received, and is a book\nthat truly highlights everything that is beautiful about mathematics.\n\nThe book describes itself as \u201cintended for researchers and advanced graduate\nstudents\u201d as well as \u201cstrongly recommended as a high school textbook\u201d.\nUnbelievably, it manages to offer an awful lot to both these groups of people\nwith its unique mix of rigour and readability.\n\nAlthough admittedly a little slow to start, after around twenty pages you\u2019ll\nbe engrossed by the most important definitions, informative lemmas, and\ndecisive theorems. Highlights include the crucial definition 2.2.8 and theorem\n3.1.15: you\u2019ll be kicking yourself for not coming up with them yourself. But\nthe true highlight of the book is the result that underlies the entire topic,\ntheorem 3.3.9.\n\nTheorem 3.3.9. Assume M(V)(|y\u03b6,C|\u2192\u222b\u222b\u221211tan\u22121( \u0304d)dJm\u222a\u22ef+exp\u22121(\u221a2\u22129)\u2265\n\u03041xtan\u22121(0\u03c9(\u03a3). Then \u2016\u02c6\u039b\u2016<y\n\nIf I had to pick one result to use to explain the beauty in mathematics to a\nnon-mathematician, this result would be it. Its proof is simply delightful:\n\nProof. This is trivial.\n\nReading Galois Knot Theory, you will find yourself constantly surprised that\nyou haven\u2019t heard of J. Maruyama: she\u2019s the author of 60 books and 82\narticles, and you\u2019ll find yourself wanting to track down and study each one.\nIf they\u2019re anywhere near as eloquent as this book, you\u2019ve been missing out for\na long time.\n\n... Ok, time to come clean. There\u2019s another reason you haven\u2019t heard of J.\nMaruyama. She\u2019s made up.\n\nIn fact, the whole book is made up.\n\nThe ruse quietly revealed in small text at the bottom of page ii:\n\nThe contents of this book were randomly generated by mathgen, a context-free\ngrammar to produce random mathematical writing.\n\nThat\u2019s why the result above appears to be complete nonsense: it is complete\nnonsense!\n\nmathgen works by starting with a basic template for a paper containing blanks.\nThese blanks are replaced with words, phrases or equations, which in turn may\ncontain blanks. By repeatedly filling the blanks, the software eventually\narrives at a final paper. On their website, you can even generate a paper with\nyourself as the author: I\u2019m not sure my supervisor is going to be very\nimpressed with my latest paper...\n\nmathgen was written by Nate Eldredge, and is partly based on SCIgen, by Jeremy\nStribling, Max Krohn, and Dan Aguayo. It is entirely open source and available\non GitHub, so why not adapt it to use more phrases from your area of research\nand exponentially increase your paper output (while simultaneously\nexponentially decreasing their quality).\n\nMatthew Scroggs\n\nMatthew is a postdoctoral researcher at University College London. He hasn\u2019t\nhad time to play Klax since the noughties, but he\u2019s pretty sure that Coke is\nit!\n\n@mscroggs mscroggs.co.uk All articles by Matthew\n\n#### More from Chalkdust\n\n  * ### Crossnumber winners, Issue 17\n\nDid you solve it?\n\n  * ### Crossnumber winners, Issue 16\n\nDid you solve it?\n\n  * ### Prize crossnumber, Issue 16\n\nCan you solve it?\n\n  * ### Cryptic crossword, Issue 16\n\nCan you solve it?\n\n  * ### Crossnumber winners, Issue 15\n\nDid you solve it?\n\n  * ### My favourite LaTeX package\n\nThe Chalkdust editors share some of their favourites\n\n# Read also\n\n  * ### Crossnumber winners, Issue 17\n\nDid you solve it?\n\n  * ### Crossnumber winners, Issue 16\n\nDid you solve it?\n\n  * ### Prize crossnumber, Issue 16\n\nCan you solve it?\n\nChalkdust is published by Chalkdust Magazine, UCL, Gower Street, London WC1E\n6BT, United Kingdom.
