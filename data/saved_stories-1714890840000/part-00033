According to Heroku\nCo-founder and Heavybit Founding Partner James Lindenbaum:\n\n### \u201cThe standing of developers within organizations has changed\nmassively\u2013they\u2019re now central figures, influencers in multimillion-dollar\npurchasing decisions, and their roles have expanded into many new areas.\nThere\u2019s a new respect for who developers are.\u201d\n\nJames Lindenbaum\n\nHeroku Co-founder\n\nIt\u2019s also arguably easier than ever to become a software developer, but it\u2019s\nmore complicated than ever to develop software products. As Tailscale Co-\nfounder David Crawshaw puts it:\n\n### I think it\u2019s worth thinking about how software has become more complex.\nThere are more people involved in building it. And that adds a lot of\norganizational and structural complexity to trying to solve problems in the\nsoftware world.\n\nDavid Crawshaw\n\nTailscale Co-founder & CTO\n\nTo prepare ourselves for the future, we\u2019re looking back at a decade of\nlearnings from development\u2013where we overestimated the effects of technology\nand where we underestimated them.\n\nThe last decade has seen:\n\n  * The maturation of cloud software post-digital transformation\n  * The emergence of the digital-native enterprise\n  * The decoupling of full-stack into front end and back end as separate disciplines\n  * The proliferation of DevOps and DevSecOps\n\nWe\u2019ve also seen significant cultural shifts as a result of cloud abstraction,\nthe growing importance of (and shift in power toward) developers as enterprise\nbuyers, and even in how we think about developer culture and diversity. As\nKubernetes Co-founder Joe Beda suggests,\n\n### There is now an idea that when things fail, you learn from it. It has been\nincredibly positive for our industry in terms of making it possible for new\nfolks to come in, to make mistakes, to learn, to get the support from those\naround them. Being able to open up our industry to a ton more different people\nalong the way.\n\nJoe Beda\n\nSemi-retired technologist, Kubernetes Co-founder\n\nWe\u2019ve compiled the histories and musings of members across the development\ncommunity, including founders and leaders at Snyk, DataDog, Netlify,\nLaunchDarkly, Fastly, and CircleCI, to understand their most important\nlearnings across 10 years of computing. Here are their stories.\n\n## Ch. 1: Technology Changes Become the New Normal\n\nBuilding software has paradoxically become more complex while becoming easier\nto start. Processes are more divorced from hardware so devs can focus on\nhigher-order challenges, and APIs have enhanced interoperability everywhere.\nBut it hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\n2018: The Kubernetes team receives OSCON Portland's Most Impactful Open Source\nProject award. (Image courtesy Kubernetes.io)\n\n### Abstraction: Cloud and Virtualization\n\nIn the last decade, even computer workstations have changed. Desktop sales hit\nrecord lows as professionals traded bulky towers with on-premise software for\nlaptops with saved logins. Salespeople used Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics;\ndevs used GitHub and Jira.\n\n### What you were coding, and how you coded, was restricted by, and embedded\nin the hardware. Those two things have gotten further and further decoupled.\n\nJim Rose\n\nCEO/CircleCI\n\nEnterprises used the buzzword \u201cdigital transformation\u201d for cloud migrations.\nBut the pandemic made migration an imperative. Remote work setups, estimated\nto take 450 days to prepare, took 10. What happened? The Cloud brought\ntechnical abstraction\u2013streamlining low-level details into higher-level\nsystems. CircleCI CEO Jim Rose suggests, \u201cIt used to be what you were coding,\nand how you coded, was restricted by, and embedded in the hardware. For the\nlast 10 years, those two things have gotten further and further decoupled.\u201d\n\nWe saw the next step in virtualization\u2013allocating system resources to load-\nbalance and help teams work asynchronously across increasingly distributed\ninfrastructure. Dev teams moved from the VMs of the 1990s to 2013\u2019s Docker\nEngine and 2014\u2019s Kubernetes, which made containerization the norm.\n\n### To truly get the most out of Cloud, you need to move beyond thinking about\nvirtual machines and start thinking about processes and serverless functions.\n\nJoe Beda\n\nKubernetes Co-founder\n\nHeptio Founder and Kubernetes Co-founder Joe Beda offers: \u201cThinking about\ncloud infrastructure, you have things like virtual machines, discs,\nnetworks\u2013software concepts modeled on physical things. To truly get the most\nout of Cloud, you need to move beyond thinking about virtual machines and\nstart thinking about processes and serverless functions. We move from VMs to\ncontainers or functions or disks to buckets or databases. For Cloud, we\u2019ve\nmoved to higher abstractions across all the different parts of compute.\u201d\n\n#### Data Management and Better Living Through APIs\n\n\u201cThe biggest change? The rise of cloud databases, in particular Snowflake, and\nits effect on data architectures,\u201d according to Vimeo Interim CEO,\nCloudConnect Founder, and former Heroku CEO Adam Gross. Making databases both\nscalable and affordable mitigated the latency challenges of access by\nreference.\u201d\n\n2020: Snowflake goes public on the NYSE. (Image courtesy Fortune.)\n\n\u201cThe Cloud revolutionized data management and architecture. The ability to\ndistribute data across Cloud instances gave teams unprecedented scalability in\na pay-as-you-go format. If databases become \u2018free,\u2019 instead of doing\nmicrosurgery to connect systems line by line, you can take everything\u2013all your\nSalesforce details and other data\u2013and have the \u2018act of copying,\u2019 along with\nthe actual storage of everything, within a database. And it\u2019s now cheap enough\nand predictable enough that I can do that with a good experience.\u201d\n\n### The biggest change? The rise of cloud databases, and the effect it had on\ndata architectures.\n\nAdam Gross\n\nInterim CEO/Vimeo\n\nThe Cloud expanded the \u201cAPI Economy\u201d\u2013which lets users share cross-app data via\nintegrations. Netlify founder Mathias Biilmann Christensen notes that APIs\nhave basically turned into business functionalities. \u201cSuddenly, we don't have\nto build the APIs ourselves because they're not that different from one\nbusiness to the other. You get all the headless CMS widgets, platforms like\nStripe for payments, Algolia for search...all the modern, headless,\ne-commerce, and inventory platforms. I think that was one of the biggest\nshifts of the last decade.\u201d\n\n## Ch. 2: Process Changes Become Movements\n\nAs technology evolved, our work did too. Grassroots movements emerged for new\nbest practices, faster software delivery, and better infrastructure\nmanagement.\n\n#### Developer Experience Comes to the Forefront\n\n2015: Snyk co-founders Guy Podjarny and Assaf Hefetz discuss third-party code\nsecurity at Velocity Conference. (Image courtesy O\u2019Reilly.)\n\nHeroku cofounder and Heavybit founding partner James Lindenbaum notes an\nimportant evolution in product development: The rise of developer experience\n(DX). In years past, tools for developers were not given the design and user\nexperience care that was invested in consumer-facing tools. Now more than 50%\nof engineering leaders suggest that DX is \u201ccritical\u201d at the C-suite level for\nadoption, as well as for attracting and retaining top talent.\n\n### A command line is an interface. An API is an interface. These things need\nto be treated as first-class citizens and designed with care and attention to\nuser experience. When we started applying design and UX practices to developer\ntools, we called it DX because we wanted to underscore the intended audience\nand attract design talent to the space.\n\nJames Lindenbaum\n\nCo-founder/Heroku, Founding Partner/Heavybit\n\n\u201cA command line is an interface. An API is an interface. These things need to\nbe treated as first-class citizens and designed with care and attention to\nuser experience. When we started applying design and UX practices to developer\ntools, we called it DX because we wanted to underscore the intended audience\nand attract design talent to the space.\u201d Lindenbaum notes that the greater\nemphasis on DX was a direct consequence of developers becoming critical\ndecision-makers within organizations. \u201cDevtools went from being underdogs\nwhich couldn't get venture funding 10 years ago, to being one of the hottest\nmarkets in venture today.\u201d\n\n#### Waterfall Gives Way to Agile, Leading to CI/CD\n\nDevelopers previously used Waterfall methodology, a sequential model prominent\nin the 1970s. Its stepwise approach was intended to enforce discipline and\nlead to higher quality, but was criticized for inflexibility and risk, as\ntesting occurred last, often requiring a return to the drawing board.\n\n### When I was a young engineer, I walked around with a physical document,\nwhich people would have to sign off on saying that there would be no more\nchanges. Of course, that didn't work.\n\nEdith Harbaugh\n\nCo-founder/LaunchDarkly\n\nLaunchDarkly Co-founder Edith Harbaugh recounts her journey\u2013and the pain of\nworking on strict Waterfall-based projects. \u201cWhen I was a young engineer, I\nwalked around with a physical document, which people would have to sign off on\nsaying that there would be no more changes. Of course, that didn't work.\nThere's always changes.\u201d\n\nMore-iterative methodologies emerged, most notably 2001\u2019s Agile, which\nemphasizes teams continuously developing, testing, and shipping. Agile paved\nthe way for continuous integration/continuous delivery, popularized in the\n2010s, which uses automation to help teams quickly ship and merge new code\ninto their main branch.\n\nHoneycomb Co-founder and CEO Christine Yen offers, \u201cOne really exciting thing\nover the last 10-15 years has been blurring the lines between development and\nproduction. Before Heroku, I remember so much of building a Rails app was\nwrestling with Capistrano...getting what worked on your machine to actually\nwork on that AWS instance or your university's server.\u201d\n\n### One thing that has been really exciting over the last 10-15 years has been\nblurring the lines between development and production.\n\nChristine Yen\n\nCo-founder & CEO/Honeycomb\n\n\u201cAnd now, not only do we have the obvious \u2018Git push, deploy workflows\u2019 process\neveryone uses, but there are cloud editors and tools where there is no\ndifference between dev and production. You have an app, it's always live, and\nyou can fork other things back into dev. I've always really liked the creation\nof software, and reducing friction between \u2018I'm trying to create a thing\u2019 and\n\u2018Other people can see it\u2019 is so exciting.\u201d\n\n#### Developers Take on Operations, Security, Monitoring\n\nIn the 2000s, clashes between developers and IT revealed different incentives.\nDevelopers sought innovation to engage paying customers, while IT prioritized\nstable environments over immediate changes that could disrupt systems. Tossing\nnew code \u201cover the wall\u201d wasn\u2019t working.\n\n2023: Global conference DevOpsDays commemorates its 15th year.\n\nDevOps emerged in response, extending beyond Agile to the full software\ndevelopment lifecycle by shifting dev and deployment left. The goal: Unite\neveryone who built, deployed, and maintained software around shared principles\nof iterative collaboration, feedback, automation, and tracking security and\noutages.\n\nChef Co-founder, DevOps pioneer, and Heavybit Partner Jesse Robbins explains\nhis epiphany on Amazon\u2019s backup systems engineering team. \u201cI went from being\nan ops tyrant to embracing development innovations, which can take the system\ndown, but bring your share price up. To improve developer productivity\u2013still\ncrucial today\u2013we found the biggest delay was all the checks and approvals\nbefore deploy. The best way to make devs more productive was to let them\nhandle deployment and put them on call for their software.\u201d\n\n\"When I asked Tim O\u2019Reilly to let us start the Velocity Conference, it was\nbecause we could see the pieces falling into place. While developers would, of\ncourse, continue to write the important software that was already eating the\nworld, the future would also require robust infrastructure to support it--and\npeople to run this new ecosystem. The future wasn't going to belong to a\nsingle, mythical 10x coder--it was going to belong to a growing community of\nsmart, empathetic, curious teams who put aside their egos in favor of\nconstantly learning how to keep the enormous ships they were sailing above\nwater and pointed in the right direction.\"\n\n### It\u2019s not clear there\u2019s a discrete difference today between observability\nversus incident management versus DevSecOps. Everything is part of that\ncontinuous lifecycle.\n\nJesse Robbins\n\nCo-founder/Chef, Partner/Heavybit\n\nIt also became clearer DevOps should own site reliability engineering,\nensuring continuous availability through monitoring, incident management, and\ncapacity planning. Robbins recalls, \u201cAs Amazon\u2019s \u2018Master of Disaster,\u2019 I led\nchaos engineering GameDays to introduce major system failures so we could\nlearn about reliability. But in a safe environment where people could\nexperiment, so I pushed for more empathy within DevOps (or as we called it,\n#hugops). Then again, it\u2019s not clear there\u2019s a discrete difference today\nbetween observability versus IM versus DevSecOps. Everything is part of that\ncontinuous lifecycle.\u201d\n\nHoneycomb\u2019s Christine Yen adds, \u201cI think the rise of SRE has been a shift in\nhow teams think about what it means to deliver a great service. From \u2018Are my\nmachines okay?\u2019 to \u2018Are my customers happy? Are my teams effective?\u2019 And of\ncourse, the rise of open telemetry, which we are proud to say we've played a\nsupporting role in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first wave of DevOps was about teaching ops to code and automate.\nObservability supported the second wave\u2013developers learning how to own their\ncode in production. And you see that with SRE supporting You Build It, You Run\nIt initiatives from companies like PagerDuty and Salesforce.\u201d\n\nTeams began to own more processes, including security via DevSecOps\u2013building\ncontrols directly into dev and deployment processes, including static app\nsecurity testing, dynamic app security testing, and software composition\nanalysis.\n\n### DevOps graduated from a side \u2018digital transformation\u2019 project to the\ncenter. Central teams are now the buyers of modern tools too.\n\nGuy Podjarny\n\nCo-founder & CEO/Snyk\n\nGuy Podjarny, Co-founder of DevSecOps leader Snyk, reflects on how\nDevSecOps\u2013and DevOps overall\u2013have become enterprise essentials. \u201cDevOps in the\nenterprise graduated from a side \u2018digital transformation\u2019 project to the\ncenter. Central teams are now the buyers of modern tools too. These teams\nmanage both old and new stacks in the org, and so solutions at scale need to\nhave a narrative for both, but they command bigger budget and opportunity.\u201d\n\n#### The Evolution of Web and the Jamstack Movement\n\nPopularized in 2005, Asynchronous Javascript and XML introduced asynchronous\ndata transfer that no longer forced reloads when users interacted with\nwebsites. The separation of front end and back end reduced the risk of back-\nend issues affecting front-end performance (and vice versa). Frameworks like\nAngular (2010), React (2013), and Vue.js (2014), further expanded on AJAX's\nfoundation.\n\n2019: Attendees at the Jamstack Conference discuss building projects at scale.\n\nOpenSauced founder Brian Douglas reflects on how the plummeting price of\ncompute, and the seemingly endless supply of free AWS credits, fueled\ncountless success stories. \u201cI keep coming back to the story of Instagram and\nhow they used AWS to host their platform and get acquired by Facebook. There\nwere so many stories over the last 10 years of companies in that same\nsituation.\u201d\n\n### I keep coming back to the story of Instagram and how they used AWS to host\ntheir platform and get acquired by Facebook.\n\nBrian Douglas\n\nFounder & CEO/OpenSauced\n\nDouglas reflects on the rapid evolution of front-end development, highlighting\nthe unexpected dominance of React in recent years. \u201cBut to see that\nprogression of them specializing in solving these problems\u2013we now have Next.js\nbuilt on top of React. And if I could centralize the language or the\nframework, I could find developers to build stuff for me quickly. Now, I can\nmove faster.\u201d\n\nThe decoupling of front-end from back-end culminated in the Jamstack, a\nframework that combines JavaScript, APIs, and markup languages to place app\nlogic on the client side, avoiding tight connections to the back-end.\n\nMathias Biilmann Christensen, founder of Jamstack creator Netlify, recalls,\n\u201cWhen I started Netlify, it was really from this belief that there was an\nopportunity to change the core architecture of how developers build for the\nWeb. No one owned the platform\u2013there was no walled garden.\u201d\n\n### When we raised the first funding round for Netlify, we got questions like,\n\u2018Why the Web? Isn't everything going to be mobile apps?\n\nMathias Biilmann Christensen\n\nCo-founder & CEO/Netlify\n\n\u201cWhen we raised the first funding round for Netlify, we got questions like,\n\u2018Why the Web? Isn't everything going to be mobile apps?\u2019 There have been so\nmany different areas of change here. It was absolutely the Jamstack moment\nwhere you started decoupling Web UI from all the backends and started building\nan API for every functionality.\u201d\n\n## Ch. 3: New Beliefs Become Our Culture\n\nHow we think about computing and what it means to be a developer have also\nchanged\u2013including how devs start their careers, their importance, and how\nbrilliant jerks are not the answer.\n\n2017: Mike Judge\u2019s Silicon Valley lampoons some of the worst aspects of\ndeveloper culture.\n\n#### The Modern Dev Paradox: Fewer Boundaries, More Specialization, More\nGeneral Knowledge\n\nOpenSauced\u2019s Brian Douglas reflects on what a \u2018developer\u2019 is. \u201cIf I\u2019m on\nGitHub, cloning repos, keeping my Minecraft server up with WYSIWYG editors, am\nI a developer despite being 12 years old and learning a bit of Java?\nProbably.\u201d However, Douglas and others note that now, specialization is key.\n\u201cDon't ask me to do any back-end or server stuff today.\u201d\n\nHeptio\u2019s Joe Beda agrees. \u201cDevelopment has changed from something where you\ncould be a generalist to now, where you have to specialize. We've talked about\n\u2018full-stack engineers,\u2019 but I don't think that really exists anymore. This is\nonly accelerating with the excitement around AI.\u201d\n\n### The average developer has a lot more knowledge about infrastructure, and\nincreasing knowledge about security.\n\nPriyanka Sharma\n\nExecutive Director/Cloud Native Computing Foundation\n\nYet Cloud Native Computing Foundation Executive Director Priyanka Sharma\npoints out that today\u2019s developers are also generalists in infrastructure and\nsecurity. \u201cThe average developer has a lot more knowledge about\ninfrastructure, and increasing knowledge about security.\u201d TheDevSecOps\nmovement displaced general security knowledge from a few technical wizards at\nGoogle or Netflix to the general dev public. \u201cToday, end users know what they\nneed and they can call the shots. I\u2019d like to think that CNCF had a small part\nto play here. It\u2019s a different world. Customers are a lot more empowered,\neducated, and in charge of their destinies.\u201d\n\n#### Easier Entry Makes Dev Mainstream\n\nThere were ~18M developers in 2013, and ~26M as of 2023. Abstraction,\nbootcamps, no-code tooling, and now generative AI have reduced the barrier to\nentry.\n\nSharma explains. \u201cThere's new tools, and more people use them, which means\nmore people creating software, with help from automation. Generative AI has\ntaken it to another level. This is no longer a niche job.\u201d\n\n### At no point in the history of programming has making things easier\nactually shrunk the job market. At no point has that made things worse.\n\nSimon Wistow\n\nCo-founder/Fastly\n\nFastly Co-founder Simon Wistow suggests easier entry means opportunity for\nwould-be developers. \u201cAt no point in the history of programming has making\nthings easier actually shrunk the job market. At no point has that made things\nworse.\u201d\n\n#### Phasing Out: \u201c10x Devs\u201d and \u201cCode Bros\u201d\n\nOne myth that will not be missed is the \u201810x developer,\u2019 the lone wolf who\ncodes better than an entire team. Why is the myth\u2013and the toxic environment it\nspawned\u2013on its way out?\n\nThe CNCF\u2019s Priyanka Sharma doesn\u2019t mince words. \u201cI think there was a toxic\nmasculinity culture with software development, especially in the US. While we\nhave to always be vigilant towards culture corrosion, I do think things are\nbetter, at least in the ecosystem I inhabit.\u201d\n\nHeptio founder Joe Beda agrees. \u201cDevelopment was sometimes like a frat with\nhazing. But the idea of the \u201810x developer\u2019 is fading away. The real \u201810x\ndevelopers\u2019 make people around them better. It's not just about how much code\nyou're putting in an editor, it's about how you're bringing up other people\nand making everybody more effective.\u201d\n\n## Ch. 4: The Future of Computing\n\nWhat\u2019s next? Is software development as we know it on its last legs thanks to\nAI? On the contrary, veteran SREs suggest that AI will likely require humans\nin the loop. And the rest of the community anticipates even bigger\nopportunities.\n\n2023: 200+ devs and AI experts discuss what AI means for software at DevGuild:\nAI Summit.\n\n### Computing Is Just Getting Warmed Up\n\nFormer VP of Research/451 Research, Former Alchemist Accelerator Managing\nDirector, and Heavybit part-time partner Rachel Chalmers pushes back against\nthe idea of software having anything other than enormous potential. \u201cI came to\nSan Francisco in 1998 thinking the party was already over. I believe down to\nmy bones that we are in the prehistory of technology.\u201d\n\n### I believe down to my bones that we are in the prehistory of technology.\n\nRachel Chalmers\n\nPart-Time Partner/Heavybit\n\n\u201cThere's an amazing sci-fi book by Vernor Vinge called A Deepness in the Sky.\nA programmer digs through the software on the generation ship he's on. And\nhe\u2019s talking about Unix, still being used in the far future. Unix is over 50\nyears old now, and it's still everywhere. The work we do in infrastructure\ntoday lays the foundation for the far future.\u201d\n\nTailscale Co-founder David Crawshaw also predicts more upside. \u201cIt's easy to\nlook at our industry and say there was some kind of \u2018gold rush\u2019 and that it's\n\u2018over.\u2019 I don't think that's right. We've been slowly rebuilding the world\neconomy around computers. The ability to write software lets you interact with\nindustries in a highly leveraged way, where just the right software change\nwill have dramatic economic impact.\u201d\n\n### The ability to write software lets you interact with industries in a\nhighly leveraged way, where just the right software change will have dramatic\neconomic impact.\n\nDavid Crawshaw\n\nCo-founder & CTO/Tailscale\n\nSystem Initiative Co-founder & CEO and Chef Co-founder Adam Jacob suggests\nthat one of the most exciting opportunities in building new technology has\nbeen right in front of us the whole time. \u201cIf you look at the amount of\nhistory we have now and all the systems we've built, it's easy to think that\nwe've built all the cloud systems that could be built, to one degree or\nanother. But I think, in fact, we're actually very, very new at understanding\nhow to even conceptualize building those systems or thinking about how they\nget constructed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, even more exciting than how AI and LLMs could work, is the question:\n\u2018What could you build if you used all the knowledge we have today, as opposed\nto being stuck with the belief that what we did 10 years ago was the only\nway?\u2019 And I think you have to have seen a cycle of disruption, or multiple\ncycles, to realize that that's possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: When you look at any existing technology, it\u2019s natural to\nthink, \u2018Well, that thing will always be here. Obviously, it can't be\ndisrupted.\u2019 But it almost always can. It's just a question of how it can be\nimproved. And I think that our ability to capitalize on such opportunities is\nreally nestled in our understanding of how those systems get built.\u201d\n\n### It's easy to think that we've built all the cloud systems that could be\nbuilt, to one degree or another. What could you build if you used all the\nknowledge we have today, as opposed to being stuck with the belief that what\nwe did 10 years ago was the only way?\n\nAdam Jacob\n\nCEO & Co-Founder/System Initiative\n\n\u201cRight now, it seems to be a popular talking point that building things is\nsimpler or easier because all these building blocks are there, which creates a\nreal opportunity for people who are willing to ignore those building blocks\nand create something fundamentally different. Vertically-integrated, deeper\ntechnology can create opportunities that other people can't see because they\ndon't understand how the fundamentals work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really seems like we\u2019ve forgotten fundamentals like this. If you ask\ndevelopers today: How long does it take for an L1 cache hit to happen? They\nmight not know! There\u2019s opportunity living there\u2013if you understand how a\nsystem works in a fundamental way, you can build things that other people\ncan\u2019t, because they just don\u2019t know how it works.\u201d\n\n### AI: Unlocking Potential for Development\n\nMachine learning, natural language processing, and generative AI have arrived,\nand developers aren\u2019t extinct yet. Research suggests GenAI actually makes devs\nmore productive overall.\n\nDatadog CTO Alexis L\u00ea-Qu\u00f4c expresses surprise at how far GenAI has come\u2013and\nhow far it has to go. \u201cWithout a doubt, getting the computer to consistently\npass the Turing test via LLMs has been a real surprise for me. And yet,\ngetting the same techniques to deal with the physical world like a six-year-\nold is proving extremely difficult. Also a bit of a surprise.\u201d\n\n### Getting the computer to consistently pass the Turing test via LLMs has\nbeen a real surprise for me.\n\nAlexis L\u00ea-Qu\u00f4c\n\nCo-founder & CTO/Datadog\n\nCircleCI\u2019s Jim Rose suggests that although GenAI is exciting, its notable AI\nchip limitations may mean even more opportunities for devs to explore. \u201cOn the\nAI front, people are going back to hardware. They're finding ways to make\nthings run fast\u2013to make it super case-specific for the hardware it runs on.\nAnd that's interesting. A \u2018back-to-the-future\u2019 moment.\u201d\n\n#### Embracing Diversity and Becoming Stronger\n\nDiversity has been, and will continue to be, hugely beneficial for computing.\nNew people from different backgrounds will create software to solve problems\nwe might not have even considered.\n\n2023: The winners of the TED AI Hackathon.\n\nThe CNCF\u2019s Priyanka Sharma notes that advances in automation and tooling offer\nfaster starts and scalability for devs of all levels, and empower people from\ndiverse backgrounds to build truly innovative products.\n\n\u201cI was judging the TED AI Hackathon in San Francisco\u2013I'm used to hackathon\nteams being young males\u2013this was completely different. It was diverse people\nworking together on cool ideas. And with generative AI, you have all these\nclick-to-start managed services.\u201d\n\nSharma explains how the winning team designed a tool that maps voters\u2019 policy\npositions to candidates to help them understand which candidates are closest\nto their own interests. \u201cI don't think that kind of tool would come out of\npast hackathons. And because we have expanded who can participate, we\u2019re\nimpacting society in such a different manner. It just demonstrates the\nopportunity available for people who can create value.\u201d\n\nFastly\u2019s Simon Wistow is also bullish on a more-diverse future. \u201cWe're in this\nweird moment where developing a website is really complicated. You have to\nlearn technologies like Webpack and Next.js, Kubernetes and containers, and\nthen you go and deploy it, and now you've got bots, scrapers, and DDoS\nattacks. It's scary out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat excites me is a bunch of these technologies will make it easier for\neverybody, companies like Glitch, Replit, MightyMeld, and Fastly. The more\npeople with diverse backgrounds and interests, the better the industry will\nbe. We should be building the technology that opens it up to everybody. Not\njust keeping it within seven square miles of San Francisco.\u201d\n\n## Conclusion: What Lies Ahead\n\nThere\u2019s a great deal to be excited about in the future, including a\ncontinually lowering barrier to entry to software development and a\nproductivity force multiplier in AI. It\u2019s also highly likely that future\ngenerations of developers will not only look and sound different than the devs\nof 10 to 20 years ago, but also that they will learn and work in very\ndifferent ways as well. So long as developers continue to welcome diverse\nvoices and new faces, there\u2019s no limit to how much the community can grow.\n\n### Content from the Library\n\nVisit library\n\nJul 22, 2020\n\nArticle\n\n### An Interview with CNCF GM & Heavybit Adivsor, Priyanka Sharma\n\nPriyanka Sharma is a long-time community member and Heavybit advisor.
