Sharing is caring so\nwe wanted to highlight the thoughts and advice from Kyndryl, formerly IBM's\nglobal tech infrastructure services outpost, and others.\n\nOn April 22, as activists staged protests around the globe over failures to\ncurb greenhouse gas emissions, another warrior of the corporate kind spoke\nabout the perilous state of climate change.\n\nIvan Doppl\u00e9, senior veep and Global Digital Workplace Practice Lead at\nKyndryl, ruminated on the \"fragility of our planet\" while he was 35,000 feet\nin the air on a flight from Europe to Asia.\n\n\"As I sit on a flight bound for India, the view from above offers a serene yet\nsobering reminder of the fragility of our planet. Today, on Earth Day, I find\nmyself reflecting not only on my personal commitments to sustainability but\nalso on my professional responsibilities.\"\n\nThere is nothing more heartwarming than earnest emotions on networking site\nfor suits LinkedIn, for this is the medium that Ivan chose.\n\nNot resisting the temptation to promote Kyndryl, he added: \"Our team is\nfocused on developing solutions that enable businesses to reduce their\necological footprint, enhance energy efficiency, and promote sustainable\npractices through advanced technological deployments.\n\n\"We are pioneering the use of AI to optimize energy usage across corporate\nnetworks, and implementing cloud solutions that drastically cut down on\nphysical infrastructure, thereby reducing resource consumption.\"\n\nIvan isn't afraid to look closer to home either, writing that he \"embraced\norganic gardening\" and tries to opt for \"biologically nutritious options\nwhenever possible.\"\n\nWe asked if the India trip was for pleasure or business. We also highlighted\nthe energy intensive nature of AI and that the aviation industry accounts for\n2.5 percent of greenhouse emissions. The trip was to meet \"customers, partners\nand my employees,\" he told us.\n\n\"I fully understand the g'house challenge by aviation but I think in global\nroles traveling is not totally avoidable. For the people at customers and\nemployees it means a lot to have such rare moment to meet in person.\" On\nLinkedIn, Doppl\u00e9 said he tries to \"video conferencing to avoid unnecessary\ntravel, and I alternate between trains and my electric car for local\ntransportation.\"\n\nKyndryl India - Doppl\u00e9's destination - implored all of us, again via LinkedIn,\nto \"understand the impact of your emails\" and to delete as needed. \"Empty your\nrecycle bin often and delete temporary files,\" it added, and be mindful of\n\"emissions from video calls.\"\n\nIt's enough to make digital natives want to sit in a darkened room and be\nthoroughly ashamed of themselves. Now if there was only somewhere this author\ncould find a place to vent these words.... Oh, of course. LinkedIn.\n\nKyndryl wasn't the lone voice on Earth Day. Chipmaking is a dirty business but\nsomeone has to do it. Intel chief global ops officer Keyvan Esfarjani pointed\nout the corporation's mission to \"deliver a globally balanced supply chain\nthat is resilient, trusted and sustainable.\"\n\nHe added: \"As we celebrate Earth Day, we're reminded of our responsibility as\nindustry leaders. We're committed to creating more energy-efficient products,\ndriving down our industry's overall environmental footprint and empowering\nemployees to give back to their communities worldwide.\"\n\n  * Digital Realty wants to turn Irish datacenters into grid-stabilizing power jugglers\n  * IT biz trials gadget deliveries by drone to sidestep traffic and emissions\n  * Digital Realty ditches diesel for salad dressing in US to cut datacenter emissions\n  * Intel's green dream is chips without any dips in Mother Nature's health\n\nIntel, we're assured, knows that Earth Day isn't a \"moment in time, but rather\nan ongoing conversation that enables both the company and its ecosystem be the\ncatalyst for a greener tomorrow.\"\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions are one thing, but one Intel fab alone was found to\nhave created 15,000 tons of waste in one quarter alone, of which circa 60\npercent was hazardous. During the three months, the plant was also found to\nhave used enough water in production to full 1,400 Olympic swimming pools.\nThis was based on a report from 2020.\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, prepared for Earth Day by telling customers of five ways to\nrecycle and reuse their Amazon boxes. According to US marine conservation\ngroup Oceana, Amazon created 94 million kg of plastic waste in the US in 2022,\nthe weight of over 14,000 large African elephants, up 9.8 percent year-on-\nyear. Amazon had, however, cut plastic use in the rest of the world.\n\nEfforts are being made across industry to improve the situation on many\nfronts. At least Amazon and Intel weren't grandstanding on LinkedIn. Oh, wait.\n\u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Climate Change\n  * Environment\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Climate Change\n  * Environment\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Renewables\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Earth\n  * Science\n\n#### More about\n\n6 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Climate Change\n  * Environment\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Climate Change\n  * Environment\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Renewables\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Earth\n  * Science\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Crypto conferences liquidated after biblical flooding in Dubai\n\nThere's something nice about seeing Web3 fanatics in ankle-deep water\n\nBootnotes14 days | 17\n\n#### Digital Realty ditches diesel for salad dressing in US to cut datacenter\nemissions\n\nHydrotreated vegetable oil to power bit barns stateside after successful Euro\ntrial\n\nSystems20 days | 17\n\n#### Intel's green dream is chips without any dips in Mother Nature's health\n\nSustainability Summit pushes industry partners to reduce their environmental\nimpact, including harmful chemicals\n\nSystems1 month | 7\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### UK awards \u00a31.73M to AI projects to advance net zero goals\n\nGreat!
