Anything you do or create will probably receive little to\nno attention, so stop optimizing for a non-existent audience and instead focus\non what makes you enjoy the activity.\n\nWant to try a craft or artistic hobby? Focus on mastering the skill and enjoy\nthe variety it can provide. You don\u2019t need to build a personal style. No one\nwill care. Want to do photography and think black and white photos are cool?\nGreat! You don\u2019t need to create an Instagram branded all around your moody\nblack and white photos. Most likely you\u2019ll get bored of it and want to try a\ndifferent type of photography, and that\u2019s great. You aren\u2019t Ansel Adams, no\none will care if your \u201cstyle\u201d is all over the place.\n\nDo you want to build an app or website but don\u2019t enjoy the process of\ndesigning? Then make it ugly. Who cares! Design is for an audience and you\ndon\u2019t have one. Functionality is more important right now. Maybe a designer\nwill notice and want to improve it for you, but until then take pride in your\ncrappy UI.\n\nBlogging is fun and therapeutic. Grammar and editing aren\u2019t. As long as your\nthoughts are coherent, don\u2019t worry too much about writing mistakes or\nfiltering yourself. Just use Grammarly to fix elementary-level errors and move\non. It\u2019s more about the writing process than the final product.\n\nThe most egregious thing you can do with any activity is daydream about how\nyou can make money off of it. That\u2019s the quickest way to optimize for the\nwrong things and suck the fun right out of it. Most likely you will stop doing\nthe activity almost immediately, so save the money-making schemes for work.\n\nIn the end, find something you enjoy doing and just do it because you enjoy\nit. If you have to, make some goals for yourself, but never for your\n\u201caudience\u201d.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
