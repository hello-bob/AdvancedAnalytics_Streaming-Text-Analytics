What style? She alternated between a\nblank stare and a furrowed brow: \"I ... have a photo on my phone of the\nfeather that I like, I could show you that?\"\n\nThe artist rubbed his beard and told her he didn't do realistic tattoos. Maybe\nthey should set up an appointment for her sometime next week, with another\nartist, he offered. Between the lines, he seemed to say, \"This will be\npermanent, so I don't want to give you the wrong tattoo.\"\n\nBut considering how many changes skin weathers \u2014 burns heal, scars fade and\nwrinkles set in \u2014 it's sort of unbelievable that tattoos do stick around.\n\nRecently, a group of French scientists looked into how that works, hoping to\nuse the knowledge to improve tattoo removal.\n\nSo, first, of course, they gave some mice tattoos.\n\nThe mice didn't get Mom tattoos on their tiny biceps. Instead, they got tail\ntats \u2014 three stripes of green ink \u2014 for researchers to study.\n\n\"The thing is, the mouse skin can be super fragile, much more fragile than\nhuman skin,\" says Sandrine Henri, an immunologist at the Centre d'Immunologie\nMarseille-Luminy.\n\nIf you zoom way in on any tattoo, it's really just a bunch of cells holding\ntight to ink particles. From the mice's tail tattoos, Henri and her colleagues\nidentified one type of cell that captured ink particles and stayed in place,\nthe dermal macrophage.\n\nThe researchers thought they might be able to disrupt the tattoos by\ndestroying the macrophages that had locked up the ink. So they engineered mice\nwhose macrophages \u2014 and only those cells \u2014 would shrivel in the face of a\nspecific toxin, and then injected that compound into these special, tattooed\nmice.\n\nBut it didn't work.\n\nThe messed-up macrophages released their ink particles, but the color\npersisted. It turns out that new macrophages quickly took over the job of\nholding the tiny flecks of ink in place, and the mice kept their sporty green-\nstriped tails.\n\nBut if it were possible, Henri says, to use an ointment, or a drug, to delay\nthose replacement macrophages, it might improve tattoo removal for mice \u2014 and\nhumans. The researchers' findings appeared Tuesday in the Journal of\nExperimental Medicine.\n\nTo think about removing ink from human shoulders, rather than mouse tails, it\nhelps to know how tattoos appear. In broad strokes, we understand this\nprocess, says Bruce Klitzman, a biomedical engineer at Duke who once worked on\ncreating an erasable tattoo.\n\nAs a tattoo artist outlines a yin-yang symbol on someone's shoulder, a solid\nneedle loaded with ink pierces the tattoo-ee's skin, or epidermis, and the\nneedle's exit lets pigment flow into a second layer of skin, the dermis,\nKlitzman says.\n\nBut any self-respecting immune system treats all visitors \u2014 including the ink\nparticles meant to create a wolf's face on your forearm \u2014 as unwelcome. So\nskin cells mount a multilevel attack on the ink particles.\n\nFirst, the cells that weren't hit by the tattoo needle block out guests,\nKlitzman says. Only a fraction of the ink an artist lays down actually makes\nit into the dermis, and this is also why new tattoos tend to leak ink as they\nheal.\n\nNewly tattooed skin swells, the same way it would respond to any other wound,\nand blood and lymph ferry away the smallest bits of ink. For the remaining\npigment particles, the next order of the immune system's business is consuming\nthe foreign invaders, to try to destroy them.\n\nThat's where the macrophages, the cells Henri studied, come in. They're\nspecialized immune cells \u2014 their name means big eater in Greek \u2014 and their job\nis to slurp up interlopers, says Klitzman. \"Macrophages can basically swallow\nmany, many tattoo pigment particles, almost like a vacuum cleaner, just go\nalong and suck up all those particles,\" he says.\n\nUsually, a macrophage digests the invaders it devours, using acid to rip its\nenemy apart. It's a good strategy for killing bacteria and viruses, but not\nfor tattoo pigments. Acid has little effect on the ink ingredients.\n\nThat means a macrophage that has gorged on ink has no way to finish its job.\nEventually, the pigment-filled macrophages dial back their attack, content to\ncontain the threat, even if they can't completely neutralize it. \"They just\nsit there like a full vacuum cleaner bag,\" says Klitzman.\n\nAnother type of cell, called a fibroblast, is also known to take in some ink\nparticles in human skin. Together, the macrophages and fibroblasts bind enough\nink for the image of, say, a carrot or feather to appear on your calf.\n\nThose cells and the pigment inside them can hang around for years. But all\ncells die eventually, which brought Henri and her team to their question: How\ndo tattoos stay put as individual cells die?\n\nTheir work confirms that even when macrophages die and release their pigment\nparticles, other macrophages quickly gobble up the ink, keeping it in place.\n\nEven when the researchers grafted one mouse's tail tattoo onto another mouse's\nback, the second mouse's own macrophages carried the skin graft's tattoo. \"The\ncells from the graft died and released the ink, and the host mouse's cells\ncaptured it,\" Henri says.\n\nAll of that, basically, underscores why tattoo removal is really, really\ndifficult.\n\nLaser removal is an option, says Jared Jagdeo, a dermatologist at University\nof California, Davis. Tuned to a wavelength specific to a tattoo's colors,\n\"lasers are able to break apart tattoo particles,\" he says. The bursts of\nenergy bust ink \"from larger boulders into smaller rocks, and then into fine\npebbles which then can be swept away by the lymphatic system.\"\n\nBut laser removal is far from perfect. The process of blurring ink beyond\nrecognition can take many sessions, spaced weeks apart, at a couple hundred\ndollars a visit.\n\nLaser pulses irritate skin, and people show re-uptake of ink similar to\nHenri's mice, Jagdeo says. He uses anti-inflammatory drugs to help tame that\nresponse, but it's really difficult to remove all evidence of a tattoo.\n\"Tattoos are at their baseline permanent, so if [someone gets] a tattoo they\nshould plan on having it for a while,\" he says.\n\nBack at the tattoo shop, I don't know if the woman with the red-tailed hawk\nfeather ever managed to get her tattoo. Either way, I hope she's happy with\nher decision. For now, tattoo removal is still a challenge.\n\n  * macrophages\n  * tattoo\n  * skin\n  * ink\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### On Aging\n\n#### Got brothers or sisters?
