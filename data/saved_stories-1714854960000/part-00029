The storytelling, the characters, the stellar\nperformances, the expert pacing all contribute to that success. But it's also\na visually stunning achievement that brings 17th-century feudal Japan to vivid\nlife, thanks to masterful visual effects that have been woven in so\nseamlessly, it can be challenging to distinguish between the CGI and the real\nfootage.\n\nThe novel is a fictionalized account of the key players and events in 17th-\ncentury feudal Japan that ultimately led to the naming of a new sh\u014dgun\n(central ruler), Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the advent of the Edo period. The\nclimactic event was the October 21, 1600, Battle of Sekigahara, in which\nTokugawa defeated a coalition of clans led by Ishida Mitsunari. Clavell's\nnovel also includes a fictionalized version of an English navigator named\nWilliam Adams, aka Miura Anjiin (\"the pilot of Miura\"), who was the first of\nhis nation to reach Japan in 1600, eventually becoming a samurai and one of\nTokugawa's key advisers.\n\nClavell's epic saga was a blockbuster success, selling over 6 million copies\nby 1980. The author changed the names of all the main characters, purportedly\nto \"add narrative deniability,\" and despite some inevitable inaccuracies and\nauthorial liberties, the novel is breathtaking in scope, chock-full of\nencyclopedic period details. In fact, Sh\u014dgun is often credited with\nintroducing an entire generation of Western readers to Japanese history and\nculture. \"In sheer quantity, Sh\u014dgun has probably conveyed more information\nabout Japan to more people than all the combined writings of scholars,\njournalists, and novelists since the Pacific War,\" an editor named Henry Smith\nwrote in 1980.\n\nIt was also just a cracking good read and perfect fodder for the miniseries\ncraze that hit broadcast TV in the late 1970s and early 1980s, driven by the\nrunaway success of 1977's Roots. A nine-hour miniseries adaptation of Sh\u014dgun\nran over five nights in September 1980, starring Richard Chamberlain as John\nBlackthorne and Toshiro Mifune as Lord Yoshii Toranaga, the fictional\ncharacters based on Adams and Tokugawa, respectively. It, too, was a massive\nsuccess, driving even more sales of Clavell's novel, although the reception in\nJapan was far more negative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / Hiroyuki Sanada stars as Lord Yoshii Toranaga, a character based on\nthe historical figure Tokugawa Ieyasu.\n\nFX/Hulu\n\nFast-forward to 2018, when FX announced that it had made a straight-to-series\norder for a new adaptation of the novel, created by Justin Marks and Rachel\nKondo. This time around, Cosmo Jarvis (Peaky Blinders, Raised by Wolves) stars\nas Blackthorne, while Hiroyuki Sanada (The Last Samurai, John Wick: Chapter 4)\nplays Toranaga. It's been described as \"a Game of Thrones set in 17th century\nJapan,\" although calling it a 17th century Japanese Godfather also captures\nthe essence of the new series.\n\nThis new incarnation of Sh\u014dgun opens in 1600. Japan's Taik\u014d died the year\nbefore, leaving five regents equally responsible for protecting his heir until\nthe child comes of age. Toranaga is one such regent, but his rival, Lord\nIshido (Takehiro Hira), conspires with the other three to have Toranaga\nimpeached, with the ultimate goal of double-crossing his co-conspirators,\nkilling the child, and ruling himself. Meanwhile, Blackthorne's ship, Erasmus,\nwrecks on the shore of the coastal village Ajiiro, where Portuguese Catholic\npriests try to turn the local samurai against the Protestant survivors.\n\nBlackthorne finds himself embroiled in this hotbed of political intrigue when\nToranaga takes a shine to him, envisioning a key role for the English pilot in\nToranaga's own secret machinations. There is a scheming local lord, Kashigi\nYabushige (Tadanobu Asano) trying to play both sides; a charming Spanish\nsailor named Vasco Rodrigues (Nestor Carbonell, Lost) who befriends\nBlackthorne; and the alluring translator, Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), who finds\nherself torn between her loyalty to Toranaga and her Catholic faith\u2014not to\nmention a growing attraction to the foreign Anjin.\n\nThe responsibility for putting together all those seamless visual effects fell\nto VFX supervisor Michael Cliett, whose extensive credits include Falling\nSkies, iZombie, Arrow, The 100, and Serenity. Cliett and his team spent a\ngrueling three years agonizing over every historical detail. \"It was all worth\nit, all the blood, sweat, and tears,\" Cliett told Ars. \"I'm so proud of the\nshow and I'm so grateful at the reception that it's gotten, the recognition of\nour hard work. I'm grateful to have been part of it.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n65\n\nJennifer Ouellette Jennifer is a senior reporter at Ars Technica with a\nparticular focus on where science meets culture, covering everything from\nphysics and related interdisciplinary topics to her favorite films and TV\nseries.
