Credit:\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nFor the first time since November, NASA\u2019s Voyager 1 spacecraft is returning\nusable data about the health and status of its onboard engineering systems.\nThe next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin returning science data\nagain. The probe and its twin, Voyager 2, are the only spacecraft to ever fly\nin interstellar space (the space between stars).\n\nVoyager 1 stopped sending readable science and engineering data back to Earth\non Nov. 14, 2023, even though mission controllers could tell the spacecraft\nwas still receiving their commands and otherwise operating normally. In March,\nthe Voyager engineering team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern\nCalifornia confirmed that the issue was tied to one of the spacecraft\u2019s three\nonboard computers, called the flight data subsystem (FDS). The FDS is\nresponsible for packaging the science and engineering data before it\u2019s sent to\nEarth.\n\nThe team discovered that a single chip responsible for storing a portion of\nthe FDS memory \u2014 including some of the FDS computer\u2019s software code \u2014 isn\u2019t\nworking. The loss of that code rendered the science and engineering data\nunusable. Unable to repair the chip, the team decided to place the affected\ncode elsewhere in the FDS memory. But no single location is large enough to\nhold the section of code in its entirety.\n\nSo they devised a plan to divide the affected code into sections and store\nthose sections in different places in the FDS. To make this plan work, they\nalso needed to adjust those code sections to ensure, for example, that they\nall still function as a whole. Any references to the location of that code in\nother parts of the FDS memory needed to be updated as well.\n\nThe team started by singling out the code responsible for packaging the\nspacecraft\u2019s engineering data. They sent it to its new location in the FDS\nmemory on April 18. A radio signal takes about 22 1\u20442 hours to reach Voyager\n1, which is over 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from Earth, and\nanother 22 1\u20442 hours for a signal to come back to Earth. When the mission\nflight team heard back from the spacecraft on April 20, they saw that the\nmodification worked: For the first time in five months, they have been able to\ncheck the health and status of the spacecraft.\n\nDuring the coming weeks, the team will relocate and adjust the other affected\nportions of the FDS software. These include the portions that will start\nreturning science data.\n\nVoyager 2 continues to operate normally. Launched over 46 years ago, the twin\nVoyager spacecraft are the longest-running and most distant spacecraft in\nhistory. Before the start of their interstellar exploration, both probes flew\nby Saturn and Jupiter, and Voyager 2 flew by Uranus and Neptune.\n\nCaltech in Pasadena, California, manages JPL for NASA.\n\nNews Media Contact Calla Cofield Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n626-808-2469 calla.e.cofield@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nAuthor Naomi HartonoPosted on April 22, 2024April 22, 2024\n\n## Archives\n\n  * April 2024\n  * March 2024\n\n## Categories\n\n  * Uncategorized\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n  * NASA\u2019s Voyager 1 Resumes Sending Engineering Updates to Earth\n  * Engineers Pinpoint Cause of Voyager 1 Issue, Are Working on Solution\n  * NASA Engineers Make Progress Toward Understanding Voyager 1 Issue\n  * Engineers Working to Resolve Issue With Voyager 1 Computer\n  * Introducing the Voyager Mission Blog\n\n## Recent Comments\n\nNo comments to show.\n\nVoyager National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA Official: Brian\nDunbar\n\n  * No Fear Act\n  * FOIA\n  * Privacy\n  * Office of Inspector General\n  * Agency Financial Reports\n  * Contact NASA\n  * Accessibility\n\n", "frontpage": true}
