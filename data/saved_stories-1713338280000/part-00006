This process does not always increase the overall usability: web\nbrowsers and related technologies (HTML, Javascript, etc.) still cannot\nachieve the performances of stand-alone applications written in C++ or Java,\nand different browsers often introduce quirks and small problems that\ndevelopers are chasing every day.\n\nApache OpenOffice is stepping ahead of this process, offering an user\ninterface that is actually simpler, and will surely work smoothly on any\ncomputer.\n\nThe Splash Screen\n\nLinux users are already accustomed to terminal emulators, and connections to\nother computers using protocols such as Secure Shell (SSH) or even Telnet in\nthe old days.\n\nMicrosoft Windows user will recognize a somewhat familiar look of the new\ninterface, that will resemble legacy DOS programs such as WordStar.\n\nThe new user interface will be unable to represent bigger and smaller fonts,\nimages, and will have a very limited support of colors (currently 16). It will\nabandon the outdated WYSIWYG paradigm (What You See Is What You Get) and will\nintroduce the new WYSIWYG-WABIT (What You See Is What You Get -- With A BIT of\nimagination).\n\nThe Writer Interface\n\nAs this interface will be based on the latest versions of the available\nsoftware libraries, the next releases of Apache OpenOffice will unfortunately\nnot support the following architectures:\n\n  * Linux x86,\n  * Windows 32-bit,\n\nbut the following architectures will be supported instead:\n\n  * MS-DOS 6.22 on dual-core ARM CPU's,\n  * Windows 3.11 (only on 64-bit systems),\n  * OS/2 on PowerPC.\n\nThe proposed release date is April 31st, 2024^[1]. More screenshots will be\navailable soon.\n\nStay tuned for more updates!\n\n1: Please note that the US, European Union and many other countries have\nagreed to set a one-time leap day. This is to compensate a glitch in the\ntiming that has been evolved over the past years.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011-2024 The Apache Software Foundation, Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. | Contact Us | Terms of Use | Privacy Apache, OpenOffice, OpenOffice.org and the seagull logo are registered trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation.
