Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and\ncomparison tools\n\nEuropean investor allocations to environmental, social and governance exchange\ntraded funds slowed down in the first quarter of 2024 as the sector endures an\n\u201cexistential crisis\u201d, Morningstar research shows.\n\nNet flows into ESG ETFs totalled \u20ac7.1bn in the first quarter, down from\n\u20ac13.8bn in the previous three-month period.\n\nESG sales represented 16 per cent of total ETF inflows during the quarter,\ncompared with 29 per cent in the previous period, the research found.\n\n\u201cThis means further deceleration from the highs of 2022 when close to 65 per\ncent of all flows into the European ETF market were directed to ESG-themed\nstrategies,\u201d said Jose Garcia-Zarate, associate director of passive strategies\nat Morningstar.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the\nFT Group.\n\nESG investing \u201cappears to be going through a period of existential crisis as\nflows, while still positive in absolute terms, dwindle as a proportion of\ntotal flows, particularly within equity\u201d, Garcia-Zarate added.\n\nWhile the ESG ETF flows and assets situation in Europe remained \u201con positive\nground . . . in absolute terms\u201d, it would be \u201cunwise to negate that some\ninvestors have become concerned about the underperformance of the ESG\ninvestments in the last couple of years\u201d.\n\nSales of ESG equity ETFs in the first quarter amounted to \u20ac4.1bn, a sharp\ndecline on the \u20ac12.5bn collected in the previous quarter.\n\n\u201cAnother sign of concern is that this has been a period where growth equity\nstrategies have outperformed value-focused peers,\u201d Morningstar says.\n\n\u201cESG equity propositions tend to be heavy in growth stocks, which begs the\nquestion of why they have not been able to benefit from the tailwind in terms\nof flows.\u201d\n\nHowever, overall sales of European ETFs remained on a steady course in early\n2024.\n\nEuropean ETFs and exchange traded commodities gathered \u20ac44.5bn of net new\nmoney in the first three months of the year, a slight decrease on the \u20ac47.4bn\nattracted in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nFlows into equity ETFs totalled \u20ac36.8bn during the period, a slight increase\non the previous quarter, signalling investors were keen to continue riding the\nrally in global equity markets, particularly the US, Morningstar says.\n\n### Latest news on ETFs\n\nVisit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and\ncomparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG\nratings\n\nBut fixed income ETF flows fell from \u20ac14.1bn in the last quarter of 2023 to\n\u20ac8.8bn of net inflows in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\u201cThe once steady stream into bond ETFs witnessed a slowdown, reflecting\ninvestor recalibration of rate-cut expectations,\u201d says Garcia-Zarate.\n\nAt the end of March, assets under management in European ETFs stood at\n\u20ac1.81tn, up 10 per cent on the previous quarter.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s iShares arm topped the quarterly flows league with \u20ac14.1bn of net\nsales, ahead of DWS\u2019s Xtrackers business and Amundi, which respectively\nattracted \u20ac8bn and \u20ac5bn of net new money.\n\n*Ignites Europe is a news service published by
