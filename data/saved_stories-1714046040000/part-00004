Amanda\nBemis\n\nAt the crossroads of an intense creative period and a personal tragedy, Dave\nNewell found himself stuck with an idea he couldn\u2019t shake: What if he opened a\nrecord pressing plant?\n\nThis was back in 2021. Newell was grieving the death of his father, pondering\nwhat the next few decades of his own life might look like, and trying to\nfigure out what to do with the tons of music he\u2019d made over the past year.\nSince the early 2000s, Newell had traversed the rap underground, releasing\nmusic under the moniker Enoch with the Florida group CYNE. Fiercely\nindependent, his desire to self-release a new solo record eventually\ndovetailed with an even bolder idea to manufacture it himself, too.\n\n\u201cThere were a variety of factors that all fell into place,\u201d Newell tells\nRolling Stone. \u201cIt just dawned on me that this might be the perfect thing for\nme to pursue.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Newell and his wife Betsy Bemis have realized that vision\nwith Audiodrome Record Pressing, which officially opens today, April 22 (and\nyou can check out Enoch\u2019s album, which came out last month). It\u2019s a boutique\nshop in Gainesville, Florida that aims to serve smaller artists and labels\nleft in the lurch by the continued growth of vinyl, especially among pop stars\nwhose massive manufacturing needs have created industry-wide backlogs. But\nit\u2019s also a revolutionary kind of pressing plant: One powered completely by\nsolar energy.\n\nNewell and Bemis didn\u2019t set out to start the first fully solar-powered plant\nin the U.S., but sustainability was always a key consideration. When Bemis\nfirst started looking into what it would take to open a plant, she grew\nincreasingly uncomfortable with the heavy environmental impact of\nmanufacturing vinyl. Vinyl itself is made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a\nplastic polymer, and often comes wrapped in single-use plastic shrink-wrap. On\ntop of all that, there\u2019s the heavy carbon footprint left by every stage of\nmanufacturing and shipping.\n\n\u201cIf we were going to do this, I needed us to do it in a way that we could feel\ngood about, and mitigate as much as we could,\u201d Bemis says.\n\n## Editor\u2019s picks\n\n### The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\n\n### The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\n### The 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History\n\n### Every Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term\n\nAdmittedly, solar power was not part of the initial plans to make Audiodrome\neco-friendly. It was too expensive, maybe something Newell and Bemis could\npursue down the line if all went well. But after a few potential plant\nlocations fell through, the couple came across an available space in a new\nmulti-purpose development called San Felasco Tech City that was powered by\nsolar energy and boasted one of the largest arrays of bifacial solar panels in\nthe world.\n\n\u201cThey just had everything we needed,\u201d Newell says. \u201cIt was kind of\nserendipitous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had always wanted solar,\u201d Bemis adds, \u201cso when we found this place that had\nthe incredible electricity needs that pressing plants need, and was fully\nsolar powered, we thought, \u2018This was the place for us.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese solar panels will power Audiodrome\u2019s two steamless record presses from\nViryl Technologies. Typically, vinyl records are pressed with machines that\nuse fossil fuel-burning boilers to create steam that melts and flattens PVC\npellets into a disc. Steamless machines conjure the same heat to create the\nsame effect but without a boiler. They do operate on a much \u201csmaller scale,\u201d\nNewell acknowledges, though that\u2019s just fine for a shop the size of\nAudiodrome. (\u201cIf we had 20 presses, we wouldn\u2019t have much of a choice \u2014 we\u2019d\nhave to run a boiler,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat\u2019s not a knock on anybody, that\u2019s just\nhow it works.\u201d)\n\nThe steamless machines also feature a closed-loop chiller system that\ndrastically cuts down on water waste, recycling the water needed to heat, then\ncool, the PVC into a disc. \u201cThe water bill we get is unbelievable,\u201d Newell\nquips. \u201cIt\u2019s like $10!\u201d\n\n## Related\n\n### Beyonc\u00e9's Classic 'Cowboy Carter' Finally Arrives on Vinyl -- Here's Where\nto Score it Online\n\n### Tierra Whack Drops Urban Outfitters Exclusive Vinyl and Graphic Tee\nCelebrating Her Debut Album\n\n### After Billie Eilish's Oscar Win, Here's Where You Can Buy the Barbie Movie\nSoundtrack Online\n\nAudiodrome has adopted other practices that are starting to become more\nstandard across the vinyl manufacturing industry as it aims to embrace\nsustainability (Newell and Bemis both admire the eco-friendly efforts of the\nDutch plant, Deepgroves). The excess trim cut from newly-pressed records is\nrecycled to make more records, and anything that doesn\u2019t pass quality control\nis similarly ground up and used again. Workers still have to wear nitrile\ngloves during the manufacturing process, but Bemis says they\u2019re testing ones\nthat are \u201cbiodegradable within five years, versus the typical 100.\u201d\n\nBut Newell and Bemis are also putting forward some innovations of their own.\nThey\u2019ve commissioned two kinds of exterior packaging options they hope clients\nwill embrace as an alternative to single-use plastics: One, made from paper,\nis curbside recyclable and biodegradable, while the other, partly made from\ncornstarch, is compostable.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not a one-for-one,\u201d Bemis admits. \u201cThey\u2019re not as transparent as poly\nbags and shrink-wrap, but the hope is that bands on tour [use them], or\n[artists] not on a major label, or in a big box store that\u2019s requiring you to\nhave it shrink-wrapped.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have something that\u2019s a little different than what people are used to,\u201d\nNewell adds. \u201cI don\u2019t know if everybody in the industry is gonna use this\ntomorrow, but it could be a good baby step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAudiodrome soft-launched in January and has been pressing records for a small\ngroup of clients since then. Newell has an array of contacts throughout\nindependent music, especially hip-hop, while Bemis has tipped off some of her\nfriends in the classical music world. But even before their official opening,\nword of mouth was getting around.\n\n\u201cOne guy just called me out of the blue and he\u2019d seen on our website that we\nwere family owned,\u201d Newell says. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Man, that\u2019s the coolest thing\nin the world. I want to press records with you because I just love that.\u2019\nThat\u2019s the kind of thing I hope we continue with.\u201d\n\n## Trending\n\n### Billie Eilish Would Like to Reintroduce Herself\n\n### Team Trump Is Ready to Lose the Supreme Court Immunity Case.

The goal is for their two machines to press between\n250,000 to 300,000 records a year, just during day shifts. If the demand is\nthere, they\u2019ll consider adding night shifts, but Newell says they want to \u201cdo\nthings right\u201d and \u201cdo it well.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cI don\u2019t want to take on a bunch of work just to make a buck. And I\nwant the people that work with us to take pride in it.\u201d\n\n### More News\n\n  * ### Nicki Nicole Reminds an Ex What He's Lost on 'Ojos Verdes'\n\n    * new cumbia\n    * By\n\nJulyssa Lopez\n\n  * ### Kim Petras Cancels Summer Fest Appearances Due to Health Concerns: 'I'm Devastated'\n\n    * Get Well Soon\n    * By\n\nCharisma Madarang\n\n  * ### Stagecoach Livestream 2024: How to Watch the Country Music Festival from Home\n\n    * Festival Season\n    * By\n\nJohn Lonsdale\n\n  * ### Drew Carey Had a Spiritual and Sexual Awakening at His First Phish Concert\n\n    * Glad You Had Fun\n    * By\n\nLarisha Paul\n\n  * ### Dionne Warwick on Her Rock Hall Induction: 'I've Never Considered Myself a Rock & Roller'\n\n    * SERENE DIONNE\n    * By\n\nDavid Browne\n\nRead more\n\n## The Latest\n\n  * ### Giuliani Among 18 Trump Allies Indicted in Arizona for 2020 Election Scheme\n\n    * GOTCHA\n    * 23 mins ago\n\n  * ### Nicki Nicole Reminds an Ex What He's Lost on 'Ojos Verdes'\n\n    * new cumbia\n    * 1 hour ago\n\n  * ### Republicans Respond to School Shootings With Bills to Arm Teachers\n\n    * 'Dangerous Precedent'\n    * 2 hours ago\n\n  * ### Kim Petras Cancels Summer Fest Appearances Due to Health Concerns: 'I'm Devastated'\n\n    * Get Well Soon\n    * 3 hours ago\n\n### The digital daily newsletter\n\nA Cultural Force That\n\nTranscends Generations\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy\nPolicy.
