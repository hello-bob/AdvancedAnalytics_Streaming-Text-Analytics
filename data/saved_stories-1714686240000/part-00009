The attention\naware feature lowers the sound of alerts if users are looking at their device.\nIf you are looking at your phone it also dims the display until you stop\nlooking at it.\n\nApple has an online advice page on alarms, which points to controlling the\nalarm volume via the \u201cSounds & Haptics\u201d feature under settings, adding that\nthe \u201cdo not disturb\u201d and \u201csilent mode\u201d options do not affect the alarm sound.\nThe page also recommends that users check their alarm sound is not set to\n\u201cnone\u201d.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Apple\n  * iPhone\n  * Smartphones\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Apple removes WhatsApp and Threads from Chinese App Store\n\n19 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Apple loses mantle as world\u2019s biggest phone seller to Samsung as China sales drop\n\n15 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### EU fines Apple \u20ac1.8bn over App Store restrictions on music streaming\n\n4 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Why is Apple facing a \u20ac500m fine from EU over music streaming?\n\n19 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Apple reportedly faces \u20ac500m fine from EU over music streaming access\n\n19 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Apple Vision Pro reviews roundup: stunning potential with big trade-offs\n\n30 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Apple overtakes Samsung as world\u2019s top smartphone seller\n\n17 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Apple suffers setback in fight against EU order to pay \u00a311bn tax bill in Ireland\n\n9 Nov 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
