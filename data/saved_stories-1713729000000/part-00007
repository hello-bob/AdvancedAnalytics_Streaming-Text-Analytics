The cleaner wrasse\nfish appears to recognize its own visage in an underwater mirror. Octopuses\nseem to react to anesthetic drugs and will avoid settings where they likely\nexperienced past pain.\n\nAll three of these discoveries came in the last five years \u2014 indications that\nthe more scientists test animals, the more they find that many species may\nhave inner lives and be sentient. A surprising range of creatures have shown\nevidence of conscious thought or experience, including insects, fish and some\ncrustaceans.\n\nThat has prompted a group of top researchers on animal cognition to publish a\nnew pronouncement that they hope will transform how scientists and society\nview \u2014 and care \u2014 for animals.\n\nNearly 40 researchers signed \u201cThe New York Declaration on Animal\nConsciousness,\u201d which was first presented at a conference at New York\nUniversity on Friday morning. It marks a pivotal moment, as a flood of\nresearch on animal cognition collides with debates over how various species\nought to be treated.\n\nThe declaration says there is \u201cstrong scientific support\u201d that birds and\nmammals have conscious experience, and a \u201crealistic possibility\u201d of\nconsciousness for all vertebrates \u2014 including reptiles, amphibians and fish.\nThat possibility extends to many creatures without backbones, it adds, such as\ninsects, decapod crustaceans (including crabs and lobsters) and cephalopod\nmollusks, like squid, octopus and cuttlefish.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a realistic possibility of conscious experience in an animal,\nit is irresponsible to ignore that possibility in decisions affecting that\nanimal,\u201d the declaration says. \u201cWe should consider welfare risks and use the\nevidence to inform our responses to these risks.\u201d\n\nJonathan Birch, a professor of philosophy at the London School of Economics\nand a principal investigator on the Foundations of Animal Sentience project,\nis among the declaration\u2019s signatories. Whereas many scientists in the past\nassumed that questions about animal consciousness were unanswerable, he said,\nthe declaration shows his field is moving in a new direction.\n\n\u201cThis has been a very exciting 10 years for the study of animal minds,\u201d Birch\nsaid. \u201cPeople are daring to go there in a way they didn\u2019t before and to\nentertain the possibility that animals like bees and octopuses and cuttlefish\nmight have some form of conscious experience.\u201d\n\n## From 'automata' to sentient\n\nThere is not a standard definition for animal sentience or consciousness, but\ngenerally the terms denote an ability to have subjective experiences: to sense\nand map the outside world, to have capacity for feelings like joy or pain. In\nsome cases, it can mean that animals possess a level of self-awareness.\n\nIn that sense, the new declaration bucks years of historical science\northodoxy. In the 17th century, the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes argued\nthat animals were merely \u201cmaterial automata\u201d \u2014 lacking souls or consciousness.\n\nDescartes believed that animals \u201ccan\u2019t feel or can\u2019t suffer,\u201d said Rajesh\nReddy, an assistant professor and director of the animal law program at Lewis\n& Clark College. \u201cTo feel compassion for them, or empathy for them, was\nsomewhat silly or anthropomorphizing.\u201d\n\nIn the early 20th century, prominent behavioral psychologists promoted the\nidea that science should only study observable behavior in animals, rather\nthan emotions or subjective experiences. But beginning in the 1960s,\nscientists started to reconsider. Research began to focus on animal cognition,\nprimarily among other primates.\n\nBirch said the new declaration attempts to \u201ccrystallize a new emerging\nconsensus that rejects the view of 100 years ago that we have no way of\nstudying these questions scientifically.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a surge of recent findings underpin the new declaration. Scientists\nare developing new cognition tests and trying pre-existing tests on a wider\nrange of species, with some surprises.\n\nTake, for example, the mirror-mark test, which scientists sometimes use to see\nif an animal recognizes itself.\n\nIn a series of studies, the cleaner wrasse fish seemed to pass the test.\n\nThe fish were placed in a tank with a covered mirror, to which they exhibited\nno unusual reaction. But after the cover was lifted, seven of 10 fish launched\nattacks toward the mirror, signaling they likely interpreted the image as a\nrival fish.\n\nAfter several days, the fish settled down and tried odd behaviors in front of\nthe mirror, like swimming upside down, which had not been observed in the\nspecies before. Later, some appeared to spend an unusual amount of time in\nfront of the mirror, examining their bodies. Researchers then marked the fish\nwith a brown splotch under the skin, intended to resemble a parasite. Some\nfish tried to rub the mark off.\n\n\u201cThe sequence of steps that you would only ever have imagined seeing with an\nincredibly intelligent animal like a chimpanzee or a dolphin, they see in the\ncleaner wrasse,\u201d Birch said. \u201cNo one in a million years would have expected\ntiny fish to pass this test.\u201d\n\nIn other studies, researchers found that zebrafish showed signs of curiosity\nwhen new objects were introduced into their tanks and that cuttlefish could\nremember things they saw or smelled. One experiment created stress for\ncrayfish by electrically shocking them, then gave them anti-anxiety drugs used\nin humans. The drugs appeared to restore their usual behavior.\n\n0 seconds of 3 minutes, 47 secondsVolume 90%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n03:47\n\n03:47\n\nFamily shares pet octopus journey on TikTok\n\n03:48\n\nBirch said these experiments are part of an expansion of animal consciousness\nresearch over the past 10 to 15 years. \u201cWe can have this much broader canvas\nwhere we\u2019re studying it in a very wide range of animals and not just mammals\nand birds, but also invertebrates like octopuses, cuttlefish,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd\neven increasingly, people are talking about this idea in relation to insects.\u201d\n\nAs more and more species show these types of signs, Reddy said, researchers\nmight soon need to reframe their line of inquiry altogether: \u201cScientists are\nbeing forced to reckon with this larger question \u2014 not which animals are\nsentient, but which animals aren\u2019t?\u201d\n\n## New legal horizons\n\nScientists\u2019 changing understanding of animal sentience could have implications\nfor U.S. law, which does not classify animals as sentient on a federal level,\naccording to Reddy. Instead, laws pertaining to animals focus primarily on\nconservation, agriculture or their treatment by zoos, research laboratories\nand pet retailers.\n\n\u201cThe law is a very slow moving vehicle and it really follows societal views on\na lot of these issues,\u201d Reddy said. \u201cThis declaration, and other means of\ngetting the public to appreciate that animals are not just biological\nautomatons, can create a groundswell of support for raising protections.\u201d\n\nHelge-Karl / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nState laws vary widely. A decade ago, Oregon passed a law recognizing animals\nas sentient and capable of feeling pain, stress and fear, which Reddy said has\nformed the bedrock of progressive judicial opinions in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington and California are among several states where lawmakers\nthis year have considered bans on octopus farming, a species for which\nscientists have found strong evidence of sentience.\n\n### Recommended\n\nEnvironment\n\n### EnvironmentTall flowers, dead shrubs, ephemeral lake: Death Valley has\nbecome a picture of climate whiplash\n\nClimate in Crisis\n\n### Climate in CrisisDubai clears up after epic rains swamp glitzy desert city\n\nBritish law was recently amended to consider octopuses sentient beings \u2014 along\nwith crabs and lobsters.\n\n\u201cOnce you recognize animals as sentient, the concept of humane slaughter\nstarts to matter, and you need to make sure that the sort of methods you\u2019re\nusing on them are humane,\u201d Birch said. \u201cIn the case of crabs and lobsters,\nthere are pretty inhumane methods, like dropping them into pans of boiling\nwater, that are very commonly used.\u201d\n\nEvan Bush\n\nEvan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.
