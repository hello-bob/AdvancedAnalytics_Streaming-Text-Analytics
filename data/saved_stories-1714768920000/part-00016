Experts say the\nsamples which could answer questions about a significant period of solar\nsystem activity billions of years ago.\n\nState news agency Xinhua hailed the launch as \u201cthe first endeavour of its kind\nin the history of human lunar exploration\u201d.\n\nNeil Melville-Kenney, a technical officer at the European Space Agency working\nwith Chinese researchers on one of the Chang\u2019e-6 payloads, told Reuters: \u201cThe\nfar side of the moon has a mystique perhaps because we literally can\u2019t see it,\nwe have never seen it apart from with robotic probes or the very few number of\nhumans that have been around the other side.\u201d\n\nShould the mission be successful, the Chinese National Space Administration\n(CNSA) is expected to share the samples internationally, just as it did with\nthe moon rocks collected during the 5th Chang\u2019e mission \u2013 the first collected\nsince the US Apollo missions.\n\nThat mission in 2020 confirmed for the first time that China could safely\nreturn an uncrewed spacecraft to Earth from the lunar surface.\n\nChina\u2019s space program is central to the government\u2019s overall national\nstrategy, and is widely celebrated within the country as a demonstration of\nthe nation\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nBeijing\u2019s polar plans have worried Nasa, whose administrator, Bill Nelson, has\nrepeatedly warned that China would claim any water resources as its own.\nBeijing says it remains committed to cooperation with all nations on building\na \u201cshared\u201d future.\n\nNelson has also warned of China bolstering its space capabilities by using\ncivilian programs to mask military objectives, cautioning that Washington must\nremain vigilant.\n\nThe US is planning to put astronauts back on the moon by 2026 with its Artemis\n3 mission.\n\nReuters contributed to this report\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * China\n  * The moon\n  * Space\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
