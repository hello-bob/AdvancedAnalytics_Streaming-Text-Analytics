This is Meal 2.0.\u201d\n\nThat had a nice, cheery ring to it. So we sat down with the enthusiasm of true\nbelievers in progress, as we gulped down our reheated casserole and green\nbeans.\n\n\u201cThat was some serious bootstrapping,\u201d I admitted in the aftermath. \u201cLet\u2019s\npivot now to video\u2014should we do Netflix or Apple TV tonight?\u201d\n\n####\n\nThe Honest Broker is a reader-supported guide to music, books, media &\nculture.

But Techno-Optimists must graciously give up things of\nthe past, like farm fresh foods.\n\nOtherwise we might get left behind when the Techno-Optimist Rapture arrives.\n\nOur delivery system for Meal 2.0\n\nOf course, even Techno-Optimism has its limits. We try to avoid Meal 3.0. The\nfood begins to take on a rubbery, unpleasant quality after multiple migrations\nto the microwave delivery system. And I won\u2019t even speculate on the gustatory\nproperties of Meal 4.0.\n\nBut we take consolation in our loyalty to the Techno-Optimist charter. After\nall, those software upgrades also go rancid after a while, just like our\nleftovers. I only wish that I could take those improvements to Google and\nTwitter and dump them into the garbage disposal, the most serviceable user\ninterface in our Techno-Optimist home.\n\nTo brighten up our technophile repasts, we seek out the most futuristic\nbackground music. We\u2019ve found great solace in an AI-generated sad girl who\nsings the full text of the MIT software license.\n\nIt\u2019s especially liberating when we join in\u2014declaring our allegiance to this\nTechno-Optimist anthem, which grants us \u201cwithout restriction, including\nwithout limitation, the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense and/or sell\u201d our MIT software.\n\nWhat more could a couple want?\n\nBut we did want more because, after all, the future never rests. So we decided\nto create our own AI song\u2014a motivational tune for our tech-savvy lifestyles.\n\nI enthusiastically signed up with the Suno AI music app. I\u2019ve worked with many\ngreat composers over the decades, but none capable of creating 500 songs per\nmonth for just ten dollars.\n\nProgress is so exciting!\n\nI asked my AI overlord to create a \u201cjazzy bossa nova song about a wonderful\nfuture when technology and AI provide for everything people want and need.\u201d\nThis tune could serve as a daily ritual for our future-tripping.\n\nAnd our wise overlord gave us exactly that. The song is called \u201cDreams of\nTomorrow.\u201d\n\n1\u00d7\n\n0:00\n\n-1:14\n\nWould you like to sing along?\n\n> DREAMS OF TOMORROW\n>\n> In a world of limitless possibilities, we'll embrace the dawn. A fusion of\n> dreams and technology, where all desires are drawn. The gentle sway of a\n> bossa nova, the rhythm of a beat. We'll dance into the future, where\n> everything is sweet.\n>\n> With the touch of a button, our world comes alive. AI at our service,\n> fulfilling all we strive. From smart homes to self-driving cars, we'll live\n> in harmony, Where convenience meets elegance, a futuristic symphony.\n>\n> [Chorus]\n>\n> Oh, in the land of tomorrow, where dreams become real, Technology's embrace,\n> a future we can feel, Bossa nova serenades our every waking day A world of\n> endless wonder, where we'll forever sway.\n\nWasn\u2019t that fun?\n\nYou thought that real bossa nova only came from the beaches in Rio? Not\nanymore. There\u2019s a new Silicon Valley bossa, and when it passes we go \u2018ah\u2019.\n\nDisneyland\u2019s \u201cHouse of the Future,\u201d unveiled in 1957\u2014and demolished in 1967\n\nWe were now the ideal Techno-Optimist couple. So imagine my shock when I heard\ncrashing and thrashing sounds from the kitchen. I rushed in, and could hardly\nbelieve my eyes.\n\nTara had taken my favorite coffee mugs, and was pulverizing them with a\nsledgehammer. I own four of these\u2014and she had already destroyed three of them.\n\nThis was alarming. Those coffee mugs are like my personal security blanket.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I shouted.\n\n\u201cWe need to move fast and break things,\u201d she responded, a steely look in her\neyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what Mark Zuckerberg tells us to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t destroy my coffee mugs!\u201d I pleaded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s NOT destruction,\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s creative destruction! You haven\u2019t\nread your Schumpeter, or you\u2019d know the difference.\u201d\n\nMark Zuckerberg and Joseph Schumpeter\n\nShe was right\u2014it had been a long time since I\u2019d read Schumpeter, and only had\nthe vaguest recollection of those boring books. Didn\u2019t he drink coffee? I had\nno idea. So I watched helplessly as Tara smashed the final mug to smithereens.\n\nI was at a loss for words. But when she turned to my prized 1925 Steinway XR-\nGrand piano, I let out an involuntary shriek.\n\nNo, no, no, no\u2014not the Steinway.\n\nShe hesitated, and then spoke with eerie calmness: \u201cI understand your\nfeelings. But is this analog input system something a Techno-Optimist family\nshould own?\u201d\n\nI had to think fast. Fortunately I remembered that my XR-Grand was a strange\nSteinway, and it originally had incorporated a player piano mechanism (later\nremoved from my instrument). This gave me an idea:\n\nI started improvising (one of my specialties):\n\n> You\u2019re absolutely right. A piano is a shameful thing for a Techno-Optimist\n> to own. Our music should express Dreams of Tomorrow. [I hummed a few bars.]\n> But this isn\u2019t really a piano\u2014you need to consider it as a high performance\n> peripheral, with limitless upgrade potential.\n\nI opened the bottom panel, and pointed to the empty space where the player\npiano mechanism had once been. \u201cThis is where we insert the MIDI interface.\nJust wait and see.\u201d\n\nShe paused, and thought it over\u2014but still kept the sledgehammer poised in\nmidair. Then asked: \u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t just an outmoded legacy system?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me, baby,\u201d I said with all the confidence I could muster. \u201cTogether we\ncan transform this bad boy into a cutting edge digital experience platform. We\nwill sail on it together into the Metaverse.\u201d\n\nIs my 1925 Steinway an outmoded legacy system?\n\nShe hesitated\u2014then put down the sledgehammer. Disaster averted!\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re blinding me with science, my dear,\u201d I said to her in my most\nconciliatory tone.\n\n\u201cTechnology!\u201d she responded with a saucy grin.\n\nThat night at dinner, we ate Meal 2.0 in silence, except for \u201cDreams of\nTomorrow\u201d repeating endlessly in the background. The song was starting to\nannoy me.\n\nI knew we had made progress with our progress. But we hadn\u2019t even entered the\nacceleration phase yet. We had so many upgrades still ahead of us.\n\nAfter a moment, I took a chance:\n\n\u201cDarling, our Meal 2.0 delivery system is definitely dominating the food\nvertical. The analytics are irrefutable. But here\u2019s a suggestion\u2014why don\u2019t we\ninput these into our garbage disposal user interface, and go out to dinner\ninstead?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe Tex-Mex or burgers?\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cDefinitely!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go dancing too. This Techno-Optimism stuff is great. But I think we may\nhave exceeded our burn rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my thought too. Let\u2019s take a break from the future. I\u2019m sure it will\nstill be there when we get back.\u201d\n\nFULL DISCLOSURE: The above narrative is satirical in intent. No pianos or even\ncoffee mugs were damaged in its making. However, we do describe leftovers as\n\u201cMeal 2.0\u201d in our household.\n\n### Subscribe to The Honest Broker\n\nBy Ted Gioia \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nA trustworthy guide to music, books, arts, media & culture by Ted Gioia\n\n82\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How We Became a Techno-Optimist Family\n\nwww.honest-broker.com\n\n20\n\nShare\n\n20 Comments\n\nChauncey Clifford2 hrs agoVonnegut 2.0Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nRichard Grace2 hrs agoHey man, you gotta eat your leftovers.Expand full\ncommentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n18 more comments...\n\nThe State of the Culture, 2024\n\nOr a glimpse into post-entertainment society (it's not pretty)\n\nFeb 18 \u2022\n\nTed Gioia\n\n5,402\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The State of the Culture, 2024\n\nwww.honest-broker.com\n\n565\n\nWhat Can We Learn from Barnes & Noble's Surprising Turnaround?\n\nDigital platforms are struggling, meanwhile a 136-year-old book retailer is\ngrowing again.
