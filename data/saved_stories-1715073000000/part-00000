The eruption at the 22-second mark may appear\ntiny, but it's still far bigger than the size of the Earth, according to the\nESA.\n\nThe rain that's visible around the 30-second mark in the form of darker, hair-\nlike strands that almost look like a rainbow, are relatively cool, likely\nlower than 10,000 degrees Celsius. The brighter background is far hotter, at\naround a million degrees Celsius.\n\nThe Solar Orbiter has already allowed scientists to get incredibly close views\nof the Sun. When it comes to distance, only the Parker Solar Probe has it\nbeat: last year, the probe managed to set the record for the closest flyby of\nthe Sun, skimming just 4.51 million miles above its \"surface.\"\n\nHowever, the Parker probe wasn't primarily designed to record videos \u2014 it's\nonly thanks to the Solar Orbiter that we've been able to get such a\nmagnificent view.\n\nMore on the Sun: Sun Blasts Comet, Breaking Off Its Tail\n\nShare This Article\n\nWater Off Boeing's Back\n\nCommander of First Boeing Astronaut Launch Issues Warning\n\nMar 27, 11:56 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nSpace Fireworks\n\nNASA Experiment With Fire in Space Ends When Entire Spacecraft Burns Up\n\nFeb 16, 9:22 AM EST\n\nRead More\n\nBudget Cuts\n\nMars Sample Return in Trouble After Mass NASA Layoffs\n\nFeb 7, 1:09 PM EST\n\nRead More\n\nMartian Water\n\nScientists Discover Enough Mars Ice to Cover Planet in Water\n\nJan 20, 6:30 AM EST\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}

While\nIndia\u2019s global rise is a function of growth in absolute power, peer\naccommodation and a conducive \u2018chaotic\u2019 international situation, its waning\nregional influence is caused by diminishing relative power (vis-\u00e0-vis China),\nloss of primacy in South Asia, and fundamental changes in South Asian\ngeopolitics.\n\nIndia\u2019s aggregate power has grown over the past two decades \u2014 evident in\nrobust economic growth, military capabilities, and a largely young demography.\nIts inclusion in key global institutions such as the G-20, as an invitee at\nG-7 meetings, and active participation in multilateral groups such as the\nQuad, BRICS, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation further highlight its\ngeopolitical significance and its powerful presence globally, even if it is\nnot a member of the United Nations Security Council. There is a lot more peer\naccommodation of (except from China of course) of India\u2019s claims to be a\nglobally significant power. India\u2019s global rise is also aided by growing\ninternational attention on the Indo-Pacific, a theatre that is pivotal to\nglobal strategic stability, where India has a central position, geographically\nand otherwise.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * India a bridging power in many ways: Jaishankar\n\n  * Is the emerging global order bipolar?\n\n  * Dilemmas of India\u2019s great power ambitions\n\n#### Extraneous factors\n\nDespite this global rise, paradoxically and worryingly, India\u2019s influence is\ndeclining in South Asia. When compared to India\u2019s influence in the region\nduring the Cold War or in comparison to China\u2019s influence in the region today,\nIndia\u2019s power and influence in the region has sharply declined. This\ncomparative decline, not an absolute one, caused by several extraneous\nfactors, will have an impact on India\u2019s global position over time.\n\nParadoxically, again, some of the factors that have led to the decline of\nIndian influence in the region are also the reasons behind India\u2019s global\nprominence. Consider the following. The American withdrawal from the region\nand China filling that power vacuum have been disadvantageous to India. But\nthat is, at the same time, a major reason why the United States and its allies\nare keen to accommodate India\u2019s global interests including in order to push\nback China in the region. In the case of the Indo-Pacific, while interest in\nthe Indo-Pacific has increased, India\u2019s global prominence as an indispensable\nIndo-Pacific power, New Delhi\u2019s focus on the great power balance in the Indo-\nPacific may have stretched New Delhi a bit too thin in the continental\nneighbourhood.\n\nIndia and the great power contest in West Asia\n\nIf India\u2019s global rise stems from the growth in absolute power and the\ngeopolitical choices made by the leading powers of the contemporary\ninternational system, India\u2019s regional decline is a product of the dynamics of\ncomparative power, and geopolitical choices made by the region\u2019s smaller\npowers. To that extent, overlooking the balancing acts by the region\u2019s smaller\npowers to focus on the great power balancing might become counterproductive.\n\n#### The rise of China and what India must do\n\nBut the rise of China explains India\u2019s regional decline more than anything\nelse. Today, India is more powerful than it has ever been in nearly two\ncenturies. And, yet, it is, comparatively speaking, the weakest it has ever\nbeen in history vis-\u00e0-vis China. Faced with a rising superpower next door for\nthe first time, India is facing stiff geopolitical competition for influence\nin South Asia. China\u2019s rise will, therefore, mean that India may no longer be\nthe most consequential power in the region.\n\nThe arrival of China in South Asia, the withdrawal of the U.S. from the\nregion, and India\u2019s tilt to the Indo-Pacific have shifted the regional balance\nof power in Beijing\u2019s favour. Sensing this new power equation, South Asia\u2019s\nsmaller powers, India\u2019s neighbours, are engaged in a range of strategies:\nbalancing, bargaining, hedging and bandwagoning. India\u2019s smaller neighbours\nseem to find China as a useful hedge against India, for the moment at least.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that a great deal of this regional\nbalancing results from shifts in the regional balance of power, not merely\nfrom insufficient Indian outreach to the neighbourhood.\n\nWestern countries are making sensible bet on India, \u2018a rising great power\u2019,\nsays Martin Wolf\n\nWhile the presence of a rising superpower at its doorstep for the first time\nis at the heart of this paradox, the growing obsolescence of South Asia as a\ngeopolitical construct adds to India\u2019s diminishing hold on the region. For\nIndia, meeting the challenge posed by this paradox is essential as China\u2019s\nrise in South Asia will mean that India may no longer be the most\nconsequential power in the region.\n\nTo begin with, New Delhi must revisit some of its traditional conceptions of\nthe region, \u2018modernise\u2019 its primacy in South Asia, and take proactive and\nimaginative policy steps to meet the China challenge in the region.\n\nFirst of all, we must accept the reality that the region, the neighbours and\nthe region\u2019s geopolitics have fundamentally changed over the decade-and-a-half\nat the least. Not willing to acknowledge there is a problem will only make\nmatters worse.\n\nSecond, New Delhi must focus on its strengths rather than trying to match the\nmight of the People\u2019s Republic of China in every respect \u2014 the latter is a\nfool\u2019s errand. Fashioning a new engagement with the region that reflects\nIndia\u2019s traditional strengths and the region\u2019s changed realities is essential.\nReclaiming the Buddhist heritage is one such example.\n\nThird, India\u2019s continental strategy is replete with challenges whereas its\nmaritime space has an abundance of opportunities for enhancing trade, joining\nminilaterals, and creating new issue-based coalitions, among others. New Delhi\nmust, therefore, use its maritime (Indo-Pacific) advantages to cater to its\nmany continental handicaps. Doing so could involve including India\u2019s smaller\nSouth Asian neighbours to the Indo-Pacific strategic conversations. Many of\nthem are maritime states but not serious players within the Indo-Pacific\nproject. India and its partners (the U.S., Japan, Australia, the European\nUnion, and others) must find ways of engaging and partnering with Sri Lanka,\nthe Maldives, and Bangladesh as part of their larger Indo-Pacific strategy. In\nother words, New Delhi should try to wean them away from the China-led\nregional grand strategy by making them a key part of the Indo-Pacific grand\nstrategy where India and its partners hold significant advantage over China.\n\nFourth, there is today an openness in New Delhi to view the region through a\nnon-India centric lens. This also means that New Delhi is no longer uneasy\nabout external powers in its neighbourhood as it used to be during the Cold\nWar. As a consequence, there is a desire to join hands with external friendly\npartners both in the Indian Ocean and South Asia so as to deal with the\nregion\u2019s common challenges. This openness in New Delhi, and the desire of the\nexternal actors to engage the region, must be utilised to address the\ndifficulties arising out of New Delhi\u2019s regional decline.\n\n#### Tap soft power\n\nFinally, New Delhi should make creative uses of its soft power to retain its\ninfluence in the region. One way to do that is to actively encourage informal\ncontacts between political and civil society actors in India and those in\nother South Asian countries. For instance, there is a need to encourage\ninformal and unofficial conflict management processes in the region especially\nwhen and where the Indian state is hesitant about being involved directly in a\nconflict \u2014 Myanmar is a case in point.\n\nThe dichotomy between India\u2019s global rise and regional decline has profound\nimplications for India\u2019s global aspirations. It is a legitimate question to\nask whether a country that is unable to maintain primacy in its periphery will\nbe able to be a pivotal power in international politics.\n\nHappymon Jacob teaches at the School of International Studies, Jawaharlal\nNehru University, New Delhi and is the founder of Council for Strategic and\nDefence Research\n\n  * Copy link\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Telegram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Reddit\n\nRemove SEE ALL\n\nElections 2024\n\nElections 2024\n\n## Modi and Yogi are working for your children, PM says in U.P., targets\nOpposition over dynastic politics\n\nElections 2024\n\nElections 2024\n\n## Muslim quota will be removed if BJP is elected to power in Telangana,\nreiterates Amit Shah\n\nElections 2024\n\nElections 2024\n\n## Doordarshan National ropes in prominent personalities for election\nawareness campaign\n\nElections 2024\n\nElections 2024\n\n## National Conference\u2019s top leadership resigns in Ladakh to support non-INDIA\nbloc candidate\n\nElections 2024\n\nCheck out our latest election coverage\n\n### Related Topics\n\nIndia / diplomacy / China / G20 / Japan / Australia / USA / Brazil / United\nNations / oceans / European Union / Sri Lanka / Maldives / Bangladesh /\nMyanmar / international relations\n\n### Top News Today\n\n1 / 0Photos\n\nRead in App\n\n  * ##### The Hindu\n\n    * About Us\n    * Code of Editorial Values\n    * News Archive\n    * Sitemap\n    * Print Subscription\n    * Digital Subscription\n    * Subscribe to Newsletters\n    * Rss Feeds\n    * Readers Editor-Terms of Reference\n    * Authors & Contributors\n  * ##### Contact us\n\n    * Contact Us\n    * Social Media\n    * Advertise With Us\n  * ##### Group News Sites\n\n    * Business Line\n    * BL on Campus\n    * Sportstar\n    * Frontline\n    * \u0b87\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bc8\n    * The Hindu Centre\n    * Young World Club\n    * The Hindu ePaper\n    * Business Line ePaper\n    * Crossword + Free Games\n\n  * ##### Other Products\n\n    * RoofandFloor\n    * STEP\n    * Images\n    * Classifieds - Print\n    * Bookstore & Special Publications\n  * ##### Popular Sections\n\n    * Elections\n    * Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict 2023\n    * Latest News\n    * National News\n    * International News\n    * Videos\n    * Life & Style\n    * Food\n    * Podcast\n    * Showcase\n  * ##### Opinion\n\n    * Editorial\n    * Columns\n    * Comment\n    * Cartoon\n    * Letters\n    * Interview\n    * Lead\n\n  * ##### Business\n\n    * Agri-Business\n    * Industry\n    * Economy\n    * Markets\n    * Budget\n  * ##### Sport\n\n    * Cricket\n    * Football\n    * Hockey\n    * Tennis\n    * Athletics\n    * Motorsport\n    * Races\n    * Other Sports\n  * ##### Sci-Tech\n\n    * Science\n    * Technology\n    * Health\n    * Agriculture\n    * Environment\n    * Gadgets\n    * Internet\n\n  * ##### States\n\n    * Andhra Pradesh\n    * Karnataka\n    * Kerala\n    * Tamil Nadu\n    * Telangana\n  * ##### Cities\n\n    * Bengaluru\n    * Chennai\n    * Coimbatore\n    * Delhi\n    * Hyderabad\n    * Kochi\n    * Kolkata\n    * Kozhikode\n    * Madurai\n    * Mangaluru\n    * Mumbai\n    * Puducherry\n    * Thiruvananthapuram\n    * Tiruchirapalli\n    * Vijayawada\n    * Visakhapatnam\n\n  * ##### Trending on The Hindu\n\n    * News\n    * 2024 India General Election results\n    * Lok Sabha General elections 2024\n    * Lok Sabha Elections 2024 LIVE News- May 1\n    * Arvind Kejriwal arrest LIVE updates\n    * India News\n    * Prajwal Revanna\n    * Lok Sabha elections 2024 Dates\n    * Columbia university protests 2024 LIVE\n    * Aadhar\n\n  * ##### Trending on Group sites\n\n    * Stock Market Live Updates\n    * Stocks to buy today\n    * RBI MPC\n    * RCB vs KKR Live\n    * Gold Rate Today\n    * Silver Rate Today\n    * CSK vs SRH LIVE\n    * Football News\n    * Politics News\n    * Frontline Current Issue\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\nCopyright\u00a9 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.
