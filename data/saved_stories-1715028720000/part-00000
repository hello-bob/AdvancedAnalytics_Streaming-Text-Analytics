You certainly don\u2019t just want to\nbelieve the hosts\u2019 own marketing materials (since I have yet to come across a\nhost that doesn\u2019t say they\u2019re the fastest around), and doing any performance\ntests of your own will take time.\n\nPlus, are you really going to buy 10\u201315 different hosting setups only to test\ntheir loading times and uptime across 3+ years so that you can then pick the\ntop one at the end of it all?\n\nClearly, no one would be that mad, would they be?\n\nWould they?!\n\nYeah, so we actually did just that.\n\nWhat you\u2019re about to see is a summary of our findings, learnings, and\ncommentary on the top hosts in the WordPress space \u2013 plus how fast they really\nare. This is all based on around 14,000 individual measurements/tests done\nover the last 3+ years.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you want to learn about our methodology in detail, click here.\n\nIf you want to get straight to the results, keep reading. \ud83d\udc47\n\n## Here are the fastest WordPress hosts according to our tests\n\nFirst, the main thing that everyone wants to know...so who is the fastest\nhost?\n\nTable of contents\n\n### Who\u2019s the fastest all time?\n\nNow here\u2019s the best answer: it depends!\n\nBut also doesn\u2019t \u2013 since there\u2019s clearly someone with the lowest average load\ntime.\n\nI\u2019m going to show you the data and you can decide what to make of it yourself.\n\nFirst off, given that we\u2019re testing those hosts from different locations, this\nalready has a huge influence on load times. After all, our test servers are\nsomewhere, and if that \u201csomewhere\u201d is closer to the test node, then the load\ntime is going to be better than when it\u2019s on the other side of the globe.\n\nThen, there are also other factors that influence these results, which aren\u2019t\nstrictly related to the server infrastructure but more to the other software\nand optimizations that the hosting company is implementing to make the\nperceived speed of the setup better. I consider all that fair game, plus\nthere\u2019s really no way to remove that variable from the equation.\n\nWith all that said, here are the fastest WordPress hosts when looking at their\nall-time (2021-now) average load times in our testing (ordered by US load\ntime, dark green represents the lowest load time in column):\n\nHere\u2019s a more granular look of all the hosts, their average load times from\neach testing region (again), plus minimum and maximum recorded load times and\nstandard deviation (in alphabetical order):\n\n  * We have relatively less data for Rocket than for the other hosts (started tracking Q4 of 2022), so take it for what it is.\n  * Flywheel has Fastly CDN enabled by default, and you cannot disable it from the user panel. I put this in the category of \u201cweb host trying to make the experience better for its users,\u201d so I can\u2019t really hold it against them, but it still needs to be mentioned.\n  * One caveat: GoDaddy had the most problems with downtime throughout all this time. So in short, it was fast...when it worked.\n\nReality check \ud83d\udd2e\n\nI realize that many of you will be more interested in who\u2019s actually the most\nperformant host right now instead of last year or even three years ago.\nPerfectly understandable!\n\nSo here it is:\n\n### Who\u2019s the fastest this year and month?\n\nHere are the fastest hosts of 2024 so far (ordered by US load time; dark green\nrepresents the lowest load time in column):\n\nAnd if you\u2019re invested in the fastest WordPress hosts this month, here\u2019s that:\n\nNot a good month for DreamHost.\n\n### Who\u2019s the most consistent over time?\n\nConclusion: based on our tests, Rocket and Flywheel deliver the most\nconsistent performance over time.\n\nOkay, so the average speed is one thing, but the next thing I wanted to find\nout was how each hosting company\u2019s loading times have progressed over time.\n\nIt just seemed interesting to see whether these hosting companies offer the\nsame performance year after year or if there\u2019s any variance at all. Ideally,\nyou\u2019d want to see them getting faster \u2013 as every hosting company learns how to\nbe a better hosting company with each year of experience \ud83e\udd17...though that\nseemed like a fairytale, honestly, so I really wasn\u2019t expecting much.\n\nI tried various visualization methods that could effectively depict these\ntrends in load times for different web hosts. An approach that ended up being\nthe most worthwhile was using line charts to track the performance of each\nhost from quarter to quarter.\n\nThese charts are straightforward:\n\n  * each line represents load times as measured from a given region for a single host;\n  * each point on that line marks the loading time recorded for a particular quarter;\n  * there\u2019s a trend line to show progression over time.\n\nThis visual representation helps pinpoint which hosts have improved their\nspeed, which have remained consistent, and which may have experienced\ndeclines. Here\u2019s the gallery of hosts:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Click here to see the charts:\n\nClick charts to expand.\n\nAs you can see there, there actually is quite a lot going on(!). Most of the\nhosts have managed to improve their load times each year. Only a couple of\nthem stayed roughly the same or got worse. I\u2019d also like to point your\nattention to the raw values (in seconds) on the Load Time axis. For example,\neven though Flywheel\u2019s fall from grace looks pretty steep, it\u2019s only an actual\nchange from 0.2s to 0.8s of load time, which is still pretty great.\n\nOkay, so those are the individual hosts, when looked at one by one. However, I\nalso wanted to see them all in one chart. To do that, I created a cumulative\naverage chart. This chart aggregates the loading times of each host across all\nrecorded quarters while also smoothing out short-term fluctuations to reveal\nlonger-term trends. By doing so, it highlights which hosts have consistently\nmaintained fast loading times and which have seen their performance vary.\n\nHere\u2019s the chart for measurements from the US:\n\nHere it is for the EU:\n\nThe findings were revealing. Some hosts showed remarkable consistency with\nminimal fluctuation in speed, while others displayed significant variability.\n\n  * For example, check out the aforementioned Flywheel, which appeared to be worsening but actually still sits at the very bottom of the chart (it\u2019s the fastest).\n  * Cloudways, for comparison, has the flattest chart of all the hosting companies. This is in no way surprising; let\u2019s not forget that they don\u2019t actually have any server infrastructure of their own but instead host through the cloud hosting giants like Google or Digital Ocean (our test setup uses Digital Ocean).\n\n### Consistency vs peak performance\n\nThe above shows us a visual picture of how consistent those hosts are when it\ncomes to speed, but let\u2019s also take it from a different perspective and\ninvestigate the relationship between consistency vs peak performance among\nthese hosting services.\n\nThis involves looking at the average load times and comparing them with their\nvariability (standard deviation) to understand not just who is the fastest on\naverage but also who maintains the most consistent performance.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do this:\n\n  * Get the average load time and standard deviation for each host to gauge both speed and consistency.\n  * Create a scatter plot where each host is represented by a point. The x-axis shows the average load time (speed), and the y-axis presents the standard deviation (consistency).\n\nThis will help visualize which hosts not only offer low load times on average\nbut also maintain consistent performance over time:\n\nSome observations:\n\n  * Lower left quadrant. Hosts in this area offer both low average load times and low variability, indicating they are not only fast but also consistent. All things considered, the three hosts there \u2013 Flywheel, Rocket, GoDaddy \u2013 are the ones that show the best combination of speed and consistency over time.\n  * Upper right quadrant. Hosts here have higher average load times and greater variability, suggesting that you might have some better and worse periods with them.\n  * There isn\u2019t much of anything in the lower right and upper left quadrants.\n  * There are multiple hosts in the middle, meaning that they exhibit good consistency and performance throughout.\n\n### Who\u2019s the fastest \u201cmanaged WordPress\u201d host?\n\nConclusion: Flywheel is the fastest managed host, GoDaddy is the fastest\nstandard host. Managed WordPress hosts are not significantly faster than\nstandard hosts.\n\nSo there\u2019s this thing I\u2019ve been thinking about, and not just me but probably\neveryone who\u2019s ever seen the label \u201cmanaged WordPress hosting.\u201d Are those\nhosts actually any faster?\n\nWe actually do have a handful of managed setups in our test site portfolio, so\nI could find that out. I pitted those managed\u201d hosts against \u201cstandard\u201d hosts.\nHere\u2019s the lineup:\n\nStandard hosts:\n\n  * A2\n  * Bluehost\n  * DreamHost\n  * GoDaddy\n  * GreenGeeks\n  * HostGator\n  * Hostinger\n  * InMotion\n  * Namecheap\n  * Scala\n\nManaged WordPress:\n\n  * Cloudways\n  * Flywheel\n  * Kinsta\n  * Rocket\n  * SiteGround\n  * WP Engine\n\nTo determine who comes on top, I checked the overall average load times for\neach host across all regions and then ranked them within their respective\ngroups.\n\nWhen put all together, here are the top three fastest hosts in each category\n(according to their average load times):\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Fastest standard hosts:\n\n  1. GoDaddy: 0.74s\n  2. Bluehost: 1.35s\n  3. Namecheap: 1.46s\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Fastest managed hosts:\n\n  1. Flywheel: 0.47s\n  2. Rocket: 0.59s\n  3. Cloudways: 1.09s\n\nOr, to look at a broader picture, here are the average load times for all\nstandard hosts and all managed hosts:\n\nStandard hosts: 1.76s\n\nManaged hosts: 1.49s\n\nDo you get more speed with managed WordPress hosts? Yes, but only marginally.\n\nIn the end, paying premium on managed hosts doesn\u2019t seem to be worth it if all\nyou\u2019re after is speed.\n\nSpeaking of money:\n\n### Who\u2019s the fastest cheap WordPress host?\n\nThis one\u2019s quick: it\u2019s Namecheap.\n\nThey\u2019re not only the cheapest host in the lineup but also one that sits near\nthe top of the pack speed-wise (at no. 5). Here\u2019s how the price vs speed\npicture lines up:\n\nBut hold on, we\u2019re not done with the topic of pricing yet. Far from that,\nactually! I have something much more interesting for you next:\n\nGo to top\n\n## \u201cSpeed Dollars\u201d \u2013 or how much speed you get for your buck\n\nThe topic of money is always interesting and an important one when deciding\nwhich of these hosting companies to choose. You\u2019d assume that the more you\ninvest, the better performance you should get overall \u2013 faster load times,\nless downtime, better user experience in total, etc.\n\nBut is that really the case?\n\nSo just taking the speed aspect into account, I wanted to calculate \u201chow much\nspeed\u201d you get for each dollar spent.\n\nIntroducing Speed Dollars!\n\n### The need for speed...and value!\n\nI was wondering how to make these calculations all make sense and for the\nfinal Speed Dollar amounts to actually represent anything. After some trial\nand error, I\u2019ve decided to go with the following:\n\nI started by noting the slowest speed a website took to load across the entire\ndata set, which was 6.55s.\n\nWondering what the host was that recorded this slowest load time? I\u2019m not\ngoing to tell you. You\u2019ll have to look through the data set yourself for that\neaster egg. \ud83d\ude03\n\nNext, I asked a simple question: For every dollar or euro I spend, how much\ncan I reduce that sluggish 6.55 seconds?\n\nTo find the answer, I used a formula that\u2019s pretty straightforward:\n\nHere\u2019s what that math does:\n\n  * 6.55 \u2013 average load time: This tells us by how much a hosting service can decrease that maximum sluggish time.\n  * Divided by price: This shows how much each second of speed improvement costs.\n\nThe result? The Speed Dollar. The higher this number, the less you pay for\neach second your page loads faster, which means you\u2019re getting more speed for\nyour buck!\n\nNow for the results:\n\n### Speed Dollars for tests from the US\n\nConclusion: Namecheap and InMotion Hosting give you the \u201cmost speed per dollar\nspent.\u201d\n\nHere are the calculated Speed Dollar values, indicating how many seconds each\ndollar spent can shave off from the maximum load time of 6.55 seconds (when\nmeasured from testing locations in the US):\n\n  1. Namecheap: 3.66 seconds shaved off per dollar spent\n  2. InMotion: 2.49\n  3. Bluehost: 1.96\n  4. Hostinger: 1.87\n  5. DreamHost: 1.78\n  6. SiteGround: 1.67\n  7. GreenGeeks: 1.67\n  8. A2: 1.62\n  9. HostGator: 1.53\n  10. Scala: 1.35\n  11. GoDaddy: 0.82\n  12. Cloudways: 0.49\n  13. Flywheel: 0.47\n  14. WP Engine: 0.28\n  15. Rocket: 0.24\n  16. Kinsta: 0.18\n\nOnce again, Namecheap comes on top as the host that offers the best value in\nterms of reducing load time for each dollar spent, making it a highly cost-\neffective option.\n\n### Speed Euros for tests from the EU\n\nHaving done the math for the US, why not do the same for EU, right? Here are\nthe Speed Euros for the hosts, ordered from best value:\n\n  1. Namecheap: 3.23 seconds shaved off per euro spent\n  2. InMotion: 2.34\n  3. Hostinger: 2.15\n  4. SiteGround: 1.96\n  5. GreenGeeks: 1.87\n  6. Bluehost: 1.86\n  7. Scala: 1.70\n  8. DreamHost: 1.58\n  9. A2: 1.35\n  10. HostGator: 1.30\n  11. GoDaddy: 0.87\n  12. Cloudways: 0.57\n  13. Flywheel: 0.47\n  14. Rocket: 0.25\n  15. WP Engine: 0.24\n  16. Kinsta: 0.16\n\nThe order is nearly the same, with only a couple of changes here and there.\nNamecheap, again, comes out on top.\n\n### Is there any correlation between price and load time?\n\nConclusion: higher prices do not guarantee significantly better performance.\n\nThe experiment above was fun, but is there actually any real correlation\nbetween price and speed?\n\nTo find out, let\u2019s check if there\u2019s a statistically significant relationship\nbetween the cost of hosting services and their average load times.\n\nHere\u2019s the plan:\n\n  * Calculate the correlation coefficient between prices and average load times to quantify the relationship.\n  * Create a scatter plot to visually assess the relationship between price and performance across all hosts.\n\nHere\u2019s the scatter plot that presents this:\n\n  * The correlation coefficient of -0.265 indicates a weak negative relationship between price and load time. This suggests that higher prices might be associated with slightly faster load times, but the relationship is not strong.\n  * The scatter plot shows a broad spread of data points. While some higher-priced hosts offer lower average load times, there are exceptions where cheaper hosting services perform competitively, offering low load times at a lower price.\n\nThis analysis indicates that while there might be a slight tendency for more\nexpensive web hosting services to provide faster load times, the correlation\nis weak. Therefore, higher prices do not guarantee significantly better\nperformance, and there are economical hosting options that offer competitive\nspeeds.\n\nGo to top\n\n## Conclusions conclusions\n\nPutting all this data together, which of the top three hosts would I actually\nrecommend?\n\nBased on all this analysis conducted across several metrics \u2013 average load\ntimes, price-to-performance ratio (Speed Dollars), consistency in performance,\nand improvement over time \u2013 here are my top recommendations, in two scenarios:\n\n### \u201cI want the fastest host here!\u201d\n\n#### Rocket\n\n  * Performance and cost: It\u2019s a tough case with Rocket. The performance is rock-solid, as you\u2019ve seen in the tests. But it\u2019s just roughly 15x more expensive than Namecheap. So in the end, if I were to recommend a lightning-fast WordPress host to you personally (in the ~$30 / mo range), it would be it. (We host this very site on Rocket, btw.)\n  * Consistency: It\u2019s been superbly consistent. However, keep in mind that we have comparatively less data for Rocket \u2013 about half of what we have for the other hosts.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n#### Flywheel\n\n  * Performance and cost: While not the best score when it comes to Speed Dollars, the raw performance of Flywheel cannot be ignored. It\u2019s among the top two fastest hosts we\u2019ve measured.\n  * Consistency: Flywheel exhibited a super-low variability in load times, placing it in a great position in terms of consistency according to the scatter plot.\n\n### \u201cI want the most speed for the money\u201d\n\n#### Namecheap\n\n  * Performance and cost: Namecheap consistently showed up as providing excellent value for money, with one of the highest Speed Dollar and Speed Euro values.\n  * Consistency: Although not the absolute fastest, it provides a good balance between cost and performance, with relatively consistent load times.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n#### InMotion\n\n  * Performance and cost: InMotion also showed good performance in terms of Speed Dollars and Speed Euros. It offers competitive prices, making it an attractive choice for those balancing budget and speed.\n  * Consistency: Exhibits consistent performance with a lower variability in load times, plus it has also slightly improved its performance over time.\n\nGo to top\n\nLet\u2019s zoom back out \ud83d\udd2d\n\n## Our methodology\n\nLet me give you a bit of backstory first:\n\nI think we started this experiment around 2019. It began rather simple; we\njust wanted to see who\u2019s faster, Bluehost or SiteGround. Then we added WP\nEngine to the mix, and then before we knew it, our portfolio of \u201cunneeded\u201d\nhosting accounts had grown to 16 in total.\n\nYes, you read that right. For some reason, we keep paying for 16 different web\n(and) WordPress hosting accounts and use them for nothing else than \u201cscience\u201d\npurposes to check how fast they actually load and which is the fastest one.\n\nThis brings us to today. I figured, why not just show you the results of these\ntests, the historical spreadsheets, plus some conclusions and considerations\non the topic of the fastest WordPress hosting overall?\n\nI used the word \u201cscience\u201d there in quotes since what we did wasn\u2019t really\nscience. The experiment started rather organically, with no specific thought\nprocess behind it and no big planning. There are certainly some holes in this\napproach, and feel free to point them out in the comments, but I still think\nthe overall findings might be helpful for those of you interested in this kind\nof stuff.\n\nUnfortunately, we didn\u2019t track the early numbers when we just had a couple of\nhosts on record. We only started doing that around 2021, when the lineup was\nalready 12\u201314. Before that, we just shared the load times from month to month.\n\nHere\u2019s how we set up each host and how we do our tests:\n\n### We buy each hosting setup independently\n\nWe don\u2019t inform the hosting company about what we intend to do. We want to be\njust ol\u2019 regular customers for each of them.\n\nWe also use these setups to write individual reviews for those hosts, so\nsometimes we buy the entry-level plans, sometimes higher tiers of hosting.\n\n### We run a test site on each host\n\nWe use WordPress on all our test sites. We install WordPress...well...normally\n\u2013 through the host\u2019s own panel or cPanel. Nothing fancy.\n\nWe then make every site look the same:\n\n  * All sites use the same theme (Neve) and starter design (see below).\n  * All sites have the same test content; it\u2019s the stock content of the starter site design.\n  * All sites also have the same set of popular plugins to add some extra load. Right now, the stack is: All In One WP Security, Templates Patterns Collection (Themeisle\u2019s starter designs), WP Statistics, WPForms, Yoast SEO.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 Click here to see the design:\n\nThe idea behind this is that we want these websites to emulate a real website\nas much as possible. We really didn\u2019t want to just have a simple HTML page\nwith 3B of content on it. In that scenario, each host would probably do a\ngreat job loading it in no time.\n\nThe homepages of our sites are around 650KB, which, while still not huge, does\nmanage to feature all the common design elements (which you can see in the\nscreenshot above).\n\nHere\u2019s roughly how the individual resources break down:\n\nOther important considerations:\n\n  * We don\u2019t equalize the settings of the servers. In short, we want to give some benefit to the hosts that go the extra step and try to gain an inch by fine-tuning their server configuration. More or less, we want to make our experience similar to what a normal user\u2019s experience would be when they walk into a host. I\u2019d argue that most users (at least on the entry-level plans) won\u2019t fiddle with a lot of options in their hosting config files.\n  * We update all the plugins, themes and WordPress core every month.\n\nAnd, lastly, sorry, we won\u2019t make the addresses public. We just don\u2019t want the\ncompanies (or anyone else) messing with them and skewing the results over\ntime.\n\n### What we measure and how\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of tools and options to test load times and uptimes of your\nwebsite, so that\u2019s good, but we had some requirements when picking one:\n\n  * We\u2019re interested in the total load time (\u201ctime to fully loaded\u201d) of each of our test setups. Metrics like initial response times or FCP times can be misleading and aren\u2019t really representative of an actual user\u2019s experience or perceived speed of the site. That\u2019s why we went the distance and decided to measure the time it takes to load the page entirely.\n  * We wanted to be able to test the sites from multiple locations around the globe.\n  * We wanted to emulate an actual web connection and user browser in an attempt to make it not be a lab-like experiment. Know those labels that tell you what distance an electric vehicle can supposedly go on one charge? Yeah, you can predict the problem with those. We wanted to avoid somewhat the same thing when testing hosts.\n  * We needed to do multiple tests per site and then average out the numbers to get the final \u201ctypical\u201d load time. Ideally, in the range of 3\u20135.\n\nGiven the experiment was an organic one, the choice of tools also evolved\norganically. I started doing this with Pingdom Tools totally by hand. Meaning,\nI clicked through the interface, inputted the site, and picked each location\nindividually. Then repeat. Then repeat.\n\nIt was pretty doable somewhere up to the fifth site mark. Above that, I\u2019ve\ndecided to switch to something that can be more automated.\n\nThe math just doesn\u2019t work in our favor here...16 sites x 6 locations x 5 runs\neach. That\u2019s 480 individual tests every month. Have mercy on me; I\u2019m not\nclicking this through on my own any longer! \ud83d\ude03\n\nThere\u2019s just one solution on the web that can deliver all that \u2013 WebPageTest.\nIt has an API, plus some interesting open-source scripts available on the web.\nIt\u2019s highly customizable and lets you test your site from basically all over\nthe world.\n\nI\u2019ve experimented with different test locations and parameters over the years,\nbut as of 2024, I\u2019ve gone for what they call a \u201cnative\u201d connection (with no\ntraffic shaping*) and used the desktop version of Chrome as the end user\nenvironment. We\u2019ve been testing our sites from N.Virginia (USA), California\n(USA), Utah (USA), London (UK), Paris (France), and Mumbai (India).\n\n* WebPageTest also lets you set up emulated testing for different connections, like cable, DSL, 3G, LTE, and so on, plus all sorts of popular browsers and devices. Truly powerful stuff. Would recommend.\n\nWhat about uptime?\n\nOh, right, tracking uptime is much simpler. We picked UptimeRobot for that.\n\nIt pays attention to uptime 24/7 and records every second of downtime. It also\ngives us one year of history, plus those cool status pages for each of the\nhosts. Plus, we put the older numbers in a separate spreadsheet not to lose\nany data older than one year.\n\nI\u2019m only mentioning this for context. Uptime doesn\u2019t have much to do with site\nspeed, but I thought some of you would be interested to see this as well.

Namecheap does not. After the\nfirst year, you get dinged for an SSL certificate.

For example, how can you negotiate for better performance if it is\nclear from Chrome developer diagnostics that the host server itself (not\ncontent, images etc.) is creating more than two seconds\u2019 delay on a site?\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nJenny Wilson\n\nMay 28, 2018 1:27 pm\n\nWe moved our sites to SiteGround and A2 Hosting.

For better performance, you must make sure that: 1.\nUsing Premium DNS or Route53 (Amazon AWS) 2. The Best CDN, MaxCDN or\nCloudFront 3. The Server is on Litespeed Technology 4.
