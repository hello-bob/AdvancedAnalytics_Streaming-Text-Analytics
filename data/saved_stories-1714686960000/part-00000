That\u2019s what a team in Canada believes after finding\nthat Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity doesn\u2019t quite match up\nwith what astronomers are seeing at the edge of the universe!\n\nEinstein\u2019s famous theory has been the backbone of modern physics for 100\nyears, helping to explain how gravity works here on Earth and out in space.\nMoreover, countless studies have proven this theory to be accurate over the\nyears \u2014 confirming that gravity affects our three physical dimensions as well\nas the fourth dimension of time.\n\n\u201cThis model of gravity has been essential for everything from theorizing the\nBig Bang to photographing black holes,\u201d explains Robin Wen, the lead author of\nthe project and a recent Waterloo Mathematical Physics graduate, in a\nuniversity release.\n\n\u201cBut when we try to understand gravity on a cosmic scale, at the scale of\ngalaxy clusters and beyond, we encounter apparent inconsistencies with the\npredictions of general relativity. It\u2019s almost as if gravity itself stops\nperfectly matching Einstein\u2019s theory. We are calling this inconsistency a\n\u2018cosmic glitch\u2019: gravity becomes around one percent weaker when dealing with\ndistances in the billions of light years.\u201d\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics,\nexamined the possibility that the strength of gravity governing the entire\nuniverse (the cosmological gravitational constant) is slightly different than\nNewton\u2019s gravitational constant that governs gravity on smaller scales, like\nthe orbit of planets around the Sun.\n\n\u201cAlmost a century ago, astronomers discovered that our universe is expanding,\u201d\nnotes Niayesh Afshordi, a professor of astrophysics at the University of\nWaterloo and researcher at the Perimeter Institute.\n\n\u201cThe farther away galaxies are, the faster they are moving, to the point that\nthey seem to be moving at nearly the speed of light, the maximum allowed by\nEinstein\u2019s theory. Our finding suggests that, on those very scales, Einstein\u2019s\ntheory may also be insufficient.\u201d\n\nScientists have found that Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity\ndoesn\u2019t quite match up with what astronomers are seeing at the edge of the\nuniverse!

It turns out some alternative quantum gravity theories\nlike Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity naturally predict such a cosmic glitch between\nlarge and small scales. The new study provides a simple way of implementing\nthis effect like \u201ca footnote\u201d to the standard cosmological model.\n\nWen and his colleagues introduced a single new parameter called Omega_g that\nquantifies the difference between the cosmological and Newtonian gravitational\nconstants. They found that current observations from the Planck satellite\nmeasuring the cosmic microwave background radiation favor a value of Omega_g\naround -0.01, or about a one-percent difference in the strength of gravity\nacross cosmic scales compared to local scales.\n\nA negative Omega_g leads to a slightly weaker gravity, driving the expansion\nof the universe on the largest scales. This subtle effect can slightly\nalleviate a couple of long-standing issues between different cosmological\nobservations in the standard model.\n\n\u201cThink of it as being like a footnote to Einstein\u2019s theory,\u201d Wen says. \u201cOnce\nyou reach a cosmic scale, terms and conditions apply.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis new model might just be the first clue in a cosmic puzzle we are\nstarting to solve across space and time,\u201d Afshordi adds.\n\nThe researchers caution that the existence of a cosmic glitch is not yet\nconclusive based on the current data. More precise measurements from future\nexperiments mapping the cosmic microwave background and the distribution of\nmatter throughout deep space will be required to definitively confirm or rule\nout this potential breakdown of general relativity at the end of the universe.\n\nTags: albert einstein, galaxies, gravity, space, space exploration, speed of\nlight, theory of relativity\n\nAdd a Comment\n\nAbout the Author\n\n### Chris Melore\n\nChris Melore has been a writer, researcher, editor, and producer in the New\nYork-area since 2006.
