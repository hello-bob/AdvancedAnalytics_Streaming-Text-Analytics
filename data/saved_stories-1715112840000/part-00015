Why is\nthis of significance?That's not the first attempt of the German State to break\nfree of vendors by adopting open source software. We've recently witnessed\nanother attempt in \"Is The German State In Love With OSS?\" in which the State\nadopted openDesk, the open source alternative to Microsoft's and Google's\noffice applications.Using openDesk, employees, IT administrators and public\ntransport operators would have an effective open source based alternative in\nthe workplace environment, allowing the state to cut costs by not being held\nhostage in paying absurd amounts of fees to big corp software packages.This\nnew attempt of moving to LibreOffice is putting yet another stone on the path\nto the State's digital sovereignty campaign. Specifically, the federal state\nof Schleswig-Holstein has decided to move from Microsoft Windows and Microsoft\nOffice to Linux and LibreOffice, starting with the migration of 30K PCs. The\nofficial statement explains the rationale of the move:With a cabinet decision\nto introduce the open-source software LibreOffice as a standard office\nsolution across the board, the government has given the starting signal for\nthe first step towards complete digital sovereignty for the country, with\nfurther steps to follow.Ensuring digital sovereignty is at least as important\nas energy sovereignty. This cannot be achieved with the current standard IT\nworkplace products and the switch to open source solutions is an important\nbuilding block towards maintaining digital sovereignty. The use of open source\nsoftware also benefits from improved IT security, cost-effectiveness, data\nprotection and seamless collaboration between different systems.That mentality\naligns with the initiative of the Government's Sovereign tech fund for open\nsource software, which aims to strengthen the important role that software\nplays in modern society, as we found out in \"The German Government's Sovereign\nTech Fund For OSS\":The Sovereign Tech Fund started life in October 2022,\nfinanced by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate\nAction and has a lot to spend; 11.5 million EUR for 2023 alone. It's goal is\nto sustainably strengthen the open source ecosystem, focusing on security,\nresilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the code.As such\nsince October 2022 has allocated funds to projects like curl, Drupal, Fortran,\nthe Python Package Index, OpenPGP. js/GopenPGP , OpenSSH, etc.From that list\nof projects it is evident that the Fund does invest in projects that benefit\nand strengthen the open source ecosystem; package managers, open\nimplementations of communication protocols, administration tools for\ndevelopers, digital encryption technologies and libraries for programming\nlanguages.It doesn't just focus on the security aspect of OSS but adopts a\ngeneral outlook on aspects like maintenance, documentation, usability,\nreliability or bug fixes.Without underestimating those aspects the most\nimportant would certainly be Security. To that respect, there's yet another\ninitiative that spanns beyond a single state and government and is encompassed\nby the European Commission itself, as we examined in \"European Union Will Pay\nFor Finding Bugs In Open Source Software\".What better way of acknowledging\nOSS's importance than by a state-driven sponsorship?This time the EU pays for\nfinding security vulnerabilities in LibreOffice, LEOS, Mastodon, Odoo and\nCryptPad, with an added 20% bonus for providing a code fix for the bugs\ndiscovered.The criteria for choosing the particular applications were based on\ntheir actual use. All of them are open source solutions used by public\nservices across the European Union.In the end it boils down to our proposition\nof treating \"Software Security as a Civil Right\", made back in 2019 due to\nFOSSA:This EU initiative is part of the Free and Open Source Software Audit\n(FOSSA) project, thanks to Julia Reda MEP of the EU Pirate Party, who started\nthe project thinking that enough is enough after severe vulnerabilities were\ndiscovered in key infrastructure components like OpenSSL. This prompted her to\ninvolve the EU Commission in contributing to the security of the\nInternet.Schleswig-Holstein will not stop there though. The change in office\nsoftware is a milestone, but only the start of the change: the switch to free\nsoftware Operating System, collaboration platform, directory service,\nspecialist procedures and telephony will follow. In addition to open-source\nsoftware development, the aim is also to release the country's future\ndevelopment results under free licenses.Open everything, open to all.\n\n#### More Information\n\nOfficial announcement in GermanOfficial announcement auto-translated to\nEnglish\n\n#### Related Articles\n\nIs The German State In Love With OSS?The German Government's Sovereign Tech\nFund For OSSEuropean Union Will Pay For Finding Bugs In Open Source\nSoftwareSoftware Security as a Civil RightTo be informed about new articles on\nI Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and\nfollow us on Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin.| Node.js 22 Adds WebSocket Client\n29/04/2024Node.js 22 has been released with support for requiring ESM graphs,\na stable WebSocket client, and updates of the V8 JavaScript engine.\\+ Full\nStory  \n---  \nGitLab Releases Duo Chat 22/04/2024GitLab has announced that Duo Chat is now\ngenerally available in GitLab 16.11, offering a range of AI features in a\nsingle natural language chat experience.\\+ Full Story  \nMore News\n\n  * OpenSilver 2.2 Adds LightSwitch Compatibility Pack\n  * Udacity's New Discovering Ethical AI Course\n  * Spider Courtship Decoded by Machine Learning\n  * JetBrains Launches IDE Services\n  * Dev Tunnels - An Alternative to Ngrok For .NET Users\n  * Grow with Google Launches Generative AI Course\n  * Open Platform For Enterprise AI Launched\n  * Google Reduces Support For Python, Dart And Flutter\n  * Eclipse JKube 1.16 Goes GA\n  * Deno Improves JSR Support\n  * Pure Virtual C++ 2024 Sessions Announced\n  * Can C++ Be As Safe As Rust?\n\n  \n  \n#### Comments\n\nor email your comment to: comments@i-programmer.info  \n  \nLast Updated ( Friday, 03 May 2024 )  \n  \nRSS feed of news items only\n\nCopyright 2009-2024 i-programmer.info.
