The green ribbon represents one path from among\nthe many that are mathematically possible along the surface of the darker\ngreen bounding tube. Locations where the ribbon changes direction abruptly\nrepresent trajectory changes at Lagrange points, while constricted areas\nrepresent locations where objects linger in temporary orbit around a point\nbefore continuing on.\n\nThe Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN)^[1] is a collection of\ngravitationally determined pathways through the Solar System that require very\nlittle energy for an object to follow. The ITN makes particular use of\nLagrange points as locations where trajectories through space can be\nredirected using little or no energy. These points have the peculiar property\nof allowing objects to orbit around them, despite lacking an object to\norbit^[further explanation needed]. While it would use little energy,\ntransport along the network would take a long time.^[2]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nInterplanetary transfer orbits are solutions to the gravitational three-body\nproblem, which, for the general case, does not have analytical solutions, and\nis addressed by numerical analysis approximations. However, a small number of\nexact solutions exist, most notably the five orbits referred to as \"Lagrange\npoints\", which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one\nbody is significantly more massive.\n\nThe key to discovering the Interplanetary Transport Network was the\ninvestigation of the nature of the winding paths near the Earth-Sun and Earth-\nMoon Lagrange points. They were first investigated by Henri Poincar\u00e9 in the\n1890s. He noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would\nalmost always settle, for a time, on an orbit about that point.^[3] There are\nin fact an infinite number of paths taking one to the point and away from it,\nand all of which require nearly zero change in energy to reach. When plotted,\nthey form a tube with the orbit about the Lagrange point at one end.\n\nThe derivation of these paths traces back to mathematicians Charles C. Conley\nand Richard P. McGehee in 1968.^[4] Hiten, Japan's first lunar probe, was\nmoved into lunar orbit using similar insight into the nature of paths between\nthe Earth and the Moon. Beginning in 1997, Martin Lo, Shane D. Ross, and\nothers wrote a series of papers identifying the mathematical basis that\napplied the technique to the Genesis solar wind sample return, and to lunar\nand Jovian missions. They referred to it as an Interplanetary Superhighway\n(IPS).^[5]\n\n## Paths[edit]\n\nAs it turns out, it is very easy to transit from a path leading to the point\nto one leading back out. This makes sense, since the orbit is unstable, which\nimplies one will eventually end up on one of the outbound paths after spending\nno energy at all. Edward Belbruno coined the term \"weak stability\nboundary\"^[6] or \"fuzzy boundary\"^[7] for this effect.\n\nWith careful calculation, one can pick which outbound path one wants. This\nturns out to be useful, as many of these paths lead to some interesting points\nin space, such as the Earth's Moon or between the Galilean moons of Jupiter,\nwithin a few months or years.^[8]\n\nFor trips from Earth to other planets, they are not useful for crewed or\nuncrewed probes, as the trip would take many generations. Nevertheless, they\nhave already been used to transfer spacecraft to the Earth\u2013Sun L_1 point, a\nuseful point for studying the Sun that was employed in a number of recent\nmissions, including the Genesis mission, the first to return solar wind\nsamples to Earth.^[9] The network is also relevant to understanding Solar\nSystem dynamics;^[10]^[11] Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 followed such a trajectory\non its collision path with Jupiter.^[12]^[13]\n\n### Further explanation[edit]\n\nThe ITN is based around a series of orbital paths predicted by chaos theory\nand the restricted three-body problem leading to and from the orbits around\nthe Lagrange points \u2013 points in space where the gravity between various bodies\nbalances with the centrifugal force of an object there. For any two bodies in\nwhich one body orbits around the other, such as a star/planet or planet/moon\nsystem, there are five such points, denoted L_1 through L_5. For instance, the\nEarth\u2013Moon L_1 point lies on a line between the two, where gravitational\nforces between them exactly balance with the centrifugal force of an object\nplaced in orbit there. These five points have particularly low delta-v\nrequirements, and appear to be the lowest-energy transfers possible, even\nlower than the common Hohmann transfer orbit that has dominated orbital\nnavigation since the start of space travel.\n\nAlthough the forces balance at these points, the first three points (the ones\non the line between a certain large mass, e.g. a star, and a smaller, orbiting\nmass, e.g. a planet) are not stable equilibrium points. If a spacecraft placed\nat the Earth\u2013Moon L_1 point is given even a slight nudge away from the\nequilibrium point, the spacecraft's trajectory will diverge away from the L_1\npoint. The entire system is in motion, so the spacecraft will not actually hit\nthe Moon, but will travel in a winding path, off into space. There is,\nhowever, a semi-stable orbit around each of these points, called a halo orbit.\nThe orbits for two of the points, L_4 and L_5, are stable, but the halo orbits\nfor L_1 through L_3 are stable only on the order of months.\n\nIn addition to orbits around Lagrange points, the rich dynamics that arise\nfrom the gravitational pull of more than one mass yield interesting\ntrajectories, also known as low energy transfers.^[4] For example, the gravity\nenvironment of the Sun\u2013Earth\u2013Moon system allows spacecraft to travel great\ndistances on very little fuel,^[citation needed] albeit on an often circuitous\nroute.\n\n## Missions[edit]\n\nLaunched in 1978, the ISEE-3 spacecraft was sent on a mission to orbit around\none of the Lagrange points.^[14] The spacecraft was able to maneuver around\nthe Earth's neighborhood using little fuel by taking advantage of the unique\ngravity environment. After the primary mission was completed, ISEE-3 went on\nto accomplish other goals, including a flight through the geomagnetic tail and\na comet flyby. The mission was subsequently renamed the International Cometary\nExplorer (ICE).\n\nThe first low energy transfer using what would later be called the ITN was the\nrescue of Japan's Hiten lunar mission in 1991.^[15]\n\nAnother example of the use of the ITN was NASA's 2001\u20132003 Genesis mission,\nwhich orbited the Sun\u2013Earth L_1 point for over two years collecting material,\nbefore being redirected to the L_2 Lagrange point, and finally redirected from\nthere back to Earth.^[1]\n\nThe 2003\u20132006 SMART-1 of the European Space Agency used another low energy\ntransfer from the ITN.^[citation needed]\n\nIn a more recent example, the Chinese spacecraft Chang'e 2 used the ITN to\ntravel from lunar orbit to the Earth-Sun L_2 point, then on to fly by the\nasteroid 4179 Toutatis.^[citation needed]\n\n## Asteroids[edit]\n\nThe asteroid 39P/Oterma's path from outside Jupiter's orbit, to inside, and\nback to outside is said to follow these low energy paths.^[1]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Gravitational keyhole\n  * Gravity assist\n  * Halo orbit\n  * Hill sphere\n  * Horseshoe orbit\n  * Interplanetary spaceflight\n  * Lunar cycler\n  * Mars cycler\n  * Orbital mechanics\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Ross, S.
