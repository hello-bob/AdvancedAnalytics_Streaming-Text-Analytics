Legal Studies Research Paper Forthcoming\n\n19 Pages Posted: 25 Apr 2024\n\nSee all articles by Eric Goldman\n\n## Eric Goldman\n\nSanta Clara University - School of Law\n\nDate Written: April 16, 2024\n\n### Abstract\n\nI delivered this talk as the 2024 Nies Lecture at Marquette University School\nof Law, Milwaukee, WI. The talk compares the recent proliferation of\nGenerative AI with the Internet\u2019s proliferation in the mid-1990s. In each\ncase, it was clear that the technology would have revolutionary but uncertain\nimpacts on society. However, the public sentiments toward the two innovations\nhave differed radically. The Internet arrived during a period of widespread\ntechno-optimism, creating a regulatory environment that fostered the\nInternet\u2019s growth. Generative AI, in contrast, has arrived during widespread\ntechno-pessimism and following decades of conditioning about the dangers of\n\u201cAI.\u201d The difference is consequential: The prevailing regulatory and legal\nresponses to Generative AI will limit or even negate its benefits. If society\nhopes to achieve the full potential of Generative AI, we\u2019ll need to adopt a\nnew regulatory approach quickly.\n\nKeywords: generative AI, AI artificial intelligence, technology, regulation,\nopenAI, chatGPT, dall-e, section 230, 47 USC 230, first amendment, EU AI act,\ndot com boom, internet exceptionalism\n\nJEL Classification: K2, K4, L4, L5, L86, O33\n\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\n\nGoldman, Eric, Generative AI is Doomed (April 16, 2024).
