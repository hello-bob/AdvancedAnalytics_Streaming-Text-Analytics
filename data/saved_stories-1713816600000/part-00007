Apparently, the prince is an avid gamer and has high\nexpectations for SNK\u2019s growth.\n\nFounded in Osaka, Japan in 1978, SNK enjoyed remarkable success in the 1990s,\nthanks to the popularity of its arcade fighting game series such as King of\nFighters, Fatal Fury and Samurai Shodown. In this decade, SNK also entered the\nhome console market, with various iterations of their Neo Geo console. SNK\nwould file for bankruptcy in 2000, but managed to successfully rebuild itself.\n\nKing of Fighters XV, released in 2022.\n\nNews of the Saudi Arabian royal family\u2019s investment in SNK hit international\nmedia back in 2022. At this time, the prince\u2019s MiSK Foundation (Prince\nMohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Foundation) owned approx. 96% of SNK\u2019s\nshares- making it the majority shareholder. This led to concerns in the media\nover Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record (especially regarding women,\nminorities, and its ongoing role in the war in Yemen), as well as worries that\nthis would impact the content of SNK games, particularly depictions of female\nand LGBT characters. However, at the time, SNK producer and designer Yasuyuki\nOda was quoted as saying that the situation has no effect on the company\u2019s\ncreative output (source: Games Industry.biz).\n\nAs reported on Japanese game dev news site gamemakers, SNK CEO Kenji Matsubara\nrecently gave a presentation about the company\u2019s current circumstances and\ngrowth strategy at the Game Creators Conference \u201824. Currently, the Saudi\nArabian prince\u2019s foundation owns 100% of SNK\u2019s shares. Matsubara recalls\nasking the prince in an online meeting about what he wants to do with SNK.\n\nRun-and-gun Metal Slug is considered to be one of SNK\u2019s classic games.\n\nIt seems that Matsubara thought that the prince might wish to move SNK to\nSaudi Arabia and grow the company there, or develop games using SNK IPs in the\nWest, and voiced these concerns. However, in response, the prince passionately\ndemanded to see SNK grow bigger as a Japanese company and to \u201cshine brightly\non the world again,\u201d like it did in the 1990s.\n\nSamurai Shodown (image credit: Xbox Hub)\n\nMatsubara went on to outline the company\u2019s plans for future growth- explaining\nthat SNK aims to become one of the top ten game publishers in the world in ten\nyears\u2019 time. To achieve this ambitious goal, the company has not only worked\nout a long-term strategy but is also looking at the short term, precisely\ncalculating how many titles it plans to release within a 3-year period.\n\nAlthough SNK is well known in Asia, brand recognition in America and Europe is\nlacking in comparison. SNK has offices in China, but it doesn\u2019t have any in\nthe West. It seems that the Japanese video game developer and publisher is\nmoving to address these issues. According to gamemakers\u2019 report, the company\nis also working with outside partners to increase the number of game releases\nand to try making more titles outside the fighting game genre.\n\n0\n\nShares\n\n  * Share On Facebook\n  * Tweet It\n\nAuthor\n\n#### Verity Townsend\n\nAutomation West Editor and translator.

SNK\u2019s real issue is just output currently and the\npartnership with Arika will help for their own library, I would like it if\nthey also partnered up with DIMPS as well for other titles even just Action\ngames that are similar to Like A Dragon. It will take time just like all\nthings though for it to come together.\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n  * ## Popular Posts\n\n    * 1\n\nTencent\u2019s Palworld clone game prompts reaction from PocketPair CEO - \u201cThese\nare incredible times\u201d\n\n    * 2\n\nBunny girl dating sim Bunny Garden is a massive hit in Japan, topping digital\nsales charts\n\n    * 3\n\nStellar Blade\u2019s uncensored release in Japan prompts criticism of rating system\n\n    * 4\n\nLatest \u201cGame Boy\u201d device linked to luxury car thefts in Japan (Nintendo\nunaffiliated)\n\n    * 5\n\nYoko Taro says Stellar Blade is \u201cmuch better\u201d than NieR: Automata, but Hyung-\nTae Kim thinks it can\u2019t compete\n\nYou are reading\n\n###### Saudi Arabian prince wants SNK to grow as a Japanese company, rather\nthan relocate\n\nShare 1 Comment\n\n  * ## ABOUT US\n\nAUTOMATON WEST is operated by Active Gaming Media Inc.
