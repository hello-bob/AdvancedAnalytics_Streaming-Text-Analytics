Credit:\nSevrette/Andia via Alamy\n\nDownload PDF\n\nIn late 2020, COVID-19\u2019s global death toll was rising as cold weather in the\nNorthern Hemisphere and holiday gatherings spurred rapid transmission of SARS-\nCoV-2 in the absence of a vaccine. Scientists and public-health officials were\ndesperate for new ways to track the virus, which often moved faster than\ncontact tracers could follow it.\n\nTong Zhang, an environmental engineer and microbiologist at the University of\nHong Kong (HKU), and his colleagues were pioneers of what was fast becoming a\npopular surveillance method. They had been collecting periodic wastewater\nsamples from about two dozen maintenance holes in the city and testing the\nsewage for coronavirus DNA, with support from Hong Kong\u2019s government. In late\nDecember, they traced an outbreak to a single apartment building where there\nhad been no sign of cases^1.\n\nThe government quickly took action. Officials tested all of the building\u2019s\n2,000-odd residents; 9 tested positive. \u201cThose people were isolated and went\nto a quarantine site. So they stopped the transmission chain,\u201d Zhang says.\nAfter that success, he and his colleagues expanded their efforts.\n\nThese scientists traced a new coronavirus lineage to one office \u2014 through\nsewage\n\nWastewater testing remains part of Hong Kong\u2019s COVID-19 strategy to this day.\nZhang\u2019s team tests for the coronavirus at about 20 sites across the city each\nweek, he says, and the team has expanded the analysis of these samples to\ncover other pathogens, including influenza, rotavirus, norovirus and mpox, as\nwell as markers of antimicrobial resistance. He views wastewater testing as a\nway to gauge the health of an entire community at once. \u201cIf we can make the\nmethodology more standardized\u201d, this tool becomes a \u201cpromising and exciting\u201d\nway to screen the world for pathogens, including those that scientists haven\u2019t\nyet identified,he says.\n\nMany researchers are following similar approaches. There are currently more\nthan 4,600 sites around the world where wastewater is being collected for\nSARS-CoV-2 testing, and some of the research teams involved are investigating\nother potential applications, such as tracking illicit drug use and even the\nprevalence of cancer.\n\nBut whether this has the potential to be an effective public-health strategy\nis still a matter of debate. Leo Poon, a colleague of Zhang\u2019s at HKU\u2019s School\nof Public Health, says that more research should be done before health\nagencies expand their sewage testing programmes and make this surveillance\npart of their routine budgets. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot unknown,\u201d he says,\nparticularly in terms of testing for pathogens besides SARS-CoV-2. \u201cI think\nthere\u2019s a steep learning curve at the moment: when we detect something, what\ndoes it mean?\u201d\n\n## Early accomplishments\n\nMany of the projects tracking COVID-19 through wastewater started in similar\nways. Scientists learnt early in the pandemic that SARS-CoV-2 could be\nidentified in sewage^2, and made contact with local water authorities and\nhealth agencies to get samples.\n\nBy the end of 2020, several studies had shown that levels of coronavirus in\npublic water systems could correlate with the number of COVID-19 cases in the\ncommunity. For example, researchers at Stanford University in California found\nthat viral levels in wastewater rose and fell with cases in the San Francisco\nBay area^3. The group that led the work has gone on to found the\nWastewaterSCAN project, which tests samples from nearly 200 sites across the\nUnited States (see \u2018Peak transmission\u2019).\n\nIn the most successful wastewater projects, scientists say, researchers\ncollaborated directly with public-health officials, who used the data to\ninform COVID-19 safety policies. This happened in rural parts of Ghana, where,\nas in Hong Kong, wastewater testing found COVID-19 cases that hadn\u2019t been\ncaught by other types of surveillance. Habib Yakubu, a public-health\nresearcher at Emory University\u2019s Center for Global Safe Water, Sanitation, and\nHygiene in Atlanta, Georgia, worked with a team of Ghanaian scientists to\ndevelop testing methods that accounted for the country\u2019s limited public sewers\nand laboratory equipment. They tried this in two rural districts, Nanumba\nNorth and Mion, where government officials suspected that COVID-19 might be\nspreading but where clinical testing hadn\u2019t identified any cases.\n\nThe researchers worked with community leaders to identify sites for sampling,\nincluding schools, health-care facilities, markets and streams used for\nwashing clothes. \u201cWe looked at, where do people converge?\u201d Yakubu says.\nCOVID-19 was, in fact, present in these regions, the researchers found. As a\nresult, officials increased public-health activities, including community\neducation and vaccination efforts. The team tested for other diseases that are\ncommon in Ghana, including cholera and typhoid, which has also informed health\nactions.\n\nFor scientists at the Tata Institute for Genetics and Society in Bengaluru,\nIndia, the need for wastewater testing for COVID-19 became clear after the\ncountry\u2019s devastating wave of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2021,\nsays Farah Ishtiaq, an evolutionary ecologist at Tata who leads the COVID-19\nsurveillance programme in the city. She and her colleagues worked with\nofficials to set up testing at 28 water treatment plants in Bengaluru \u2014 a\nlogistically challenging task, because the team had to collect samples\nmanually rather than using the automated samplers common in higher-income\nnations.\n\nThis testing proved its worth during the spread of the Omicron variant in\nBengaluru the following year, Ishtiaq says. Wastewater data demonstrated that\nOmicron variants were spreading widely across the city at a time when data\nfrom the health-care system were limited. Officials responded by renewing mask\nmandates and placing restrictions on large gatherings, she says.\n\nInspired by case studies such as these, the field has grown drastically over\nthe past 4 years, with hundreds of research teams now testing in 72 countries,\naccording to the COVIDPoops19 dashboard maintained by environmental engineer\nColleen Naughton and her colleagues at the University of California, Merced\n(see \u2018Uneven coverage\u2019).\n\n## Interpreting poo\n\nIn December 2023 and January 2024, it was clear that COVID-19 was spreading\nwidely in several parts of the world. But public-health agencies had severely\ncut back on conventional testing and surveillance programmes, leading to\nuncertainty about how much the coronavirus was spreading, and a sudden focus\non wastewater-based epidemiology.\n\nSome scientists and social-media commentators stated that SARS-CoV-2 levels in\nwastewater correlated with specific case numbers, estimating huge surges in\nthe United States and Europe. But others cautioned that wastewater\nsurveillance is not reliable enough to predict true infection numbers. There\u2019s\na \u201cfalse sense of precision\u201d in such estimates, says Sam Scarpino, an\nepidemiologist at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, who has\nworked on COVID-19 data systems.\n\nEstimates are difficult to make because the sewage data differ considerably\nfrom conventional health indicators. In typical surveillance, data represent\nindividual infected people who can be identified through contact tracing,\nisolated and treated. In wastewater surveillance operations, data can\nrepresent entire communities.\n\nCOVID variants found in sewage weeks before showing up in tests\n\nThey make \u201ca litre represent a million people\u201d, says Douglas Manuel, a public-\nhealth physician at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Manuel and his\ncolleagues have identified several variables that can alter results from such\nscreenings; these include population density, precipitation, sample\ncomposition, handling and testing methods and quality-control measures^4. For\nexample, as snow melts in Ottawa\u2019s spring, it flows into the wastewater system\nand \u201cscours out\u201d solid waste that might have built up in the pipes, Manuel\nsays. This could interfere with findings relating to SARS-CoV-2 measurements.\n\nTo account for those variables, researchers tend to compare measurements from\none site over time. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\nfor instance, developed a metric called the wastewater viral activity level\nthat compares a testing site\u2019s recent SARS-CoV-2 measurement to past ones,\nthen averages those comparison values across larger regions.\n\nThese comparison metrics can be helpful for presenting wastewater results to\nthe public, but they gloss over the data\u2019s complexity. Bilge Kocamemi, an\nenvironmental engineer at Marmara University in Istanbul and a project\ncoordinator for Turkey\u2019s wastewater testing, says that she quickly realized\nthat \u201cscientific representation of the data makes the data unusable for the\npublic\u201d. Instead, she and her colleagues developed a relatively simple\nCOVID-19 map: testing sites are displayed in different shades of yellow and\ngreen, depending on how high SARS-CoV-2 levels are. This coloured scale is not\nprecise, Kocamemi says, but it\u2019s easy for people who don\u2019t have a scientific\nbackground to understand.\n\n## Improving estimates\n\nModelling case counts \u2014 or other metrics of COVID-19 spread in a community,\nsuch as how many people will be hospitalized \u2014 from viral levels in wastewater\nis difficult, but not impossible, say scientists who work on this challenge.\nSuch models would make it easier for health officials to make policy decisions\non the basis of sewage data.\n\nThe myriad ways sewage surveillance is helping fight COVID around the world\n\nThe CDC\u2019s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics in Washington DC,\nwhich launched in 2022, is one group taking on this challenge. Wastewater data\nare \u201ca really good leading indicator\u201d for COVID-19\u2019s burden on hospitals, says\nDylan George, the centre\u2019s director. In February, George and his colleagues\nreleased new hospital forecasting models informed by wastewater data, among\nother metrics (see go.nature.com/43xumbz). Studies have shown that such models\nare more accurate when they use wastewater data in tandem with data from the\nhealth-care system, rather than just one of those sources^5.\n\nGeorge cautions that ongoing research will be needed to better understand the\nconnection between virus levels in wastewater and disease levels in a\ncommunity. For example, some scientists think that virus levels might change\nas SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate; a variant known as JN.1 might cause people\nto shed more virus particles, or shed them for longer compared with previous\nvariants, George says. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be an active area of research\ngoing forward.\u201d\n\nModellers would like to have more detailed clinical testing data to allow them\nto make better comparisons between wastewater results and community\ninfections. The challenge is often even greater for researchers testing\nwastewater for other viruses, says Casandra Philipson, a scientist at Ginkgo\nBioworks, a company in Boston that analyses sewage from aeroplanes and\nairports, along with conducting research into new biosecurity tools. Philipson\nsays that there are decent clinical data available for COVID-19, flu and\nrespiratory syncytial virus. But, she adds, \u201cWhen you get outside of those\nthree pathogens, there really is a massive data scarcity issue.\u201d\n\n## What else can be tested in sewage?\n\nSome scientists are interested in a range of other diseases and health\nindicators that show up in people\u2019s waste.\n\nBernd Manfred Gawlik, who coordinates wastewater work at the European\nCommission\u2019s Joint Research Centre in Brussels, calls wastewater the \u201cdirty\nblood of the city\u201d, and compares sewage sampling to blood testing. \u201cWe are now\nonly starting to understand\u201d how to diagnose this \u201cblood\u201d at the collective\nlevel, he says.\n\nOne common target of testing is antimicrobial resistance (AMR), an area of\nwastewater research that pre-dates the pandemic. Ishtiaq, in Bengaluru, says\nthat \u201cAMR is a huge problem in this part of the world\u201d, because many people\nuse unregulated antibiotics. Her research has expanded from COVID-19 testing\nto a multifaceted, genomic platform that can look for both viral and bacterial\ninfections. Wastewater data will help researchers to understand which\npathogens are driving infections and communicate that information to\nphysicians, she says.\n\nFatma Guerfali, a molecular biologist and bioinformatician at the Pasteur\nInstitute in Tunis, is also tracking AMR in Tunisia, one of the countries\nconsidered most at risk. Guerfali says that she and her colleagues are working\nwith the country\u2019s health agency, as well as with research collaborators in\nother African countries, to determine how best to expand the programme, which\nstarted with COVID-19 testing.\n\nHow sewage could reveal true scale of coronavirus outbreak\n\nBeyond global targets such as AMR and flu, wastewater testing priorities\ndiffer according to local health challenges. Because this testing can pick up\na wide variety of pathogens, scientists often consult with health agencies to\ndetermine which targets to prioritize. In Louisville, Kentucky, for example,\nTed Smith, director of the Center for Healthy Air, Water and Soil at the\nUniversity of Louisville, and his colleagues are testing for a \u2018panvirome\npanel\u2019 that includes about 30 pathogens of interest to the local health\nagency. Last year, the testing picked up measles during an outbreak in the\nstate, and health officials used the data to inform vaccination programmes,\nalerts for physicians and other health efforts, he says.\n\nAnother area of expansion lies in testing chemicals that people excrete into\nwastewater. Some researchers, such as those at the start-up company Biobot\nAnalytics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are screening for opioids and other\ndrugs with a risk of misuse. Smith and his colleagues are testing sewage for\ncompounds indicative of exposure to air pollution and they have started\nresearch into lead levels. \u201cEvery day, we come up with new things that we can\ninterrogate wastewater for,\u201d he says.\n\nA few researchers are even going beyond diseases spread by humans to those\nspread by animals. In 2022, scientists published work linking new SARS-CoV-2\nvariants in New York City\u2019s wastewater to the city\u2019s rats^6. Ishtiaq is\nlooking at avian flu in Bengaluru, and Ekta Patel, a scientist at the\nInternational Livestock Research Institute in Kenya, is studying animal\ndiseases there.\n\nPatel and her colleagues are sampling sewage at slaughterhouses and testing\nfor 66 pathogens, including anthrax, brucellosis, and Rift Valley fever. To\ncomplement the wastewater tests, Patel hopes her team can collect data from\nveterinary clinics and community hospitals.\n\nSome wastewater scientists reflect on how different the early days of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic might have been had there been a robust global sewage-\nsurveillance system in place. Researchers could have \u201cimmediately\nretroactively screened wastewater all around the planet\u201d as soon as the\nvirus\u2019s sequence was released, Scarpino says. This screening could have led to\na global list of places SARS-CoV-2 was already spreading, informing strategies\nto contain the virus even before clinical testing was widely available.\n\nScarpino argues that such a system would require major financial investment,\nnational and scientific leaders who can take ownership of those projects and\nstandards that make wastewater data more comparable across countries^7.\n\nThe current COVID-19-testing community \u201ccame out of need and chaos\u201d, says\nMegan Diamond, who works on wastewater surveillance at the Rockefeller\nFoundation in New York City. Global and regional institutions such as the\nWorld Health Organization, the European Union and the Africa Centres for\nDisease Control and Prevention might need to step up and offer guidance for\ntesting, data sharing and standards, Diamond says.\n\nGawlik has worked on one such broad effort: the Global Consortium for\nWastewater and Environmental Surveillance for Public Health, or GLOWACON,\nwhich was launched in Brussels in March. By recruiting more than 300\ncollaborators from around the world, including scientists, government\nofficials and representatives of international organizations, to this\nconsortium, he hopes to advance new methods for diagnosing health issues from\nthe \u201cdirty blood\u201d of cities around the world.\n\nNature 628, 492-494 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01092-7\n\n## References\n\n  1.
