Technologies\n\n  2. Test & Measurement\n\n# 6 Ways Innovation is Changing Calibration\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nDiscover how innovations in calibration technology are revolutionizing\nprecision and efficiency across industries.\n\nMichael Johnston\n\nRelated To: Fluke Calibration\n\nWhat you\u2019ll learn:\n\n  * How innovation is reshaping calibration.\n  * Six new technologies that are helping technicians overcome challenges.\n\nAdvances in the calibration industry are opening doors for professionals to\nachieve and maintain precision in new ways (see figure). These innovations\ndirectly address challenges faced by technicians identified in a Fluke\nCalibration survey, such as meeting demand for better performance, dealing\nwith outdated equipment, and needing to calibrate machines faster.\n\nFluke Calibration\n\nNext-generation calibrators like the Fluke 5560A Multi-Product Calibrator\nstreamline calibration, enabling technicians to achieve greater accuracy while\ncalibrating multiple devices with a single tool.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll explore six new technologies paving the way to a more efficient,\nprecise, and future-ready calibration industry.\n\n### 1\\. Automated Software for Improved Process Accuracy and Efficiency\n\nCalibration automation software can be used to convert manual processes and\nprocedures into low-touch or even no-touch tasks. This improves calibration\ntime as automation speeds up tasks that are time-consuming if performed\nmanually.\n\nIn additon, automation frees up technicians from manual tasks to focus on more\nstrategic and complex assignments that require their skills and expertise.\nIncorporating this software into your calibration laboratory can lead to a\nsignificant boost in calibration throughput, with the potential to increase\nefficiency by up to 200%.\n\nAutomating calibration tasks guarantees consistent execution every time,\nregardless of location or operator. This leads to improved repeatability. And\nit allows less-experienced technicians to be guided through procedures,\nfreeing up your subject-matter experts to use their time where needed without\nrisking a drop in quality.\n\n### 2\\. Artificial Intelligence for Deep Learning and Intelligent Calibration\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that we\u2019re in a new era of artificial-intelligence (AI)\ntechnology. New applications of these tools are being identified daily, and\ncalibration is one of many sectors benefitting from this technology boom.\n\nCalibration systems driven by AI dynamically adapt and optimize processes\nusing machine learning and advanced algorithms. These systems scrutinize vast\ndatasets, accounting for variables like instrument behavior and environmental\nconditions to identify patterns and trends. This can aid processes like\ncalibration interval optimization to improve reliability and reduce\nmaintenance costs.\n\nThe automotive industry is already taking steps to use AI in design and\ndevelopment. As manufacturers come up with innovative solutions to challenges,\nsuch as trying to accelerate the electronic-control-unit (ECU) calibration\nprocess for hybrid and electric vehicles, AI is increasingly driving the\nprocess.\n\n### 3\\. Cloud-Based Management Systems Establish Compliance Through\nAccessibility\n\nCompliance is too critical to rely on outdated techniques. If there's anything\nthat can motivate businesses to move beyond digitized databases and static\nspreadsheets, it\u2019s a cloud-based management system\u2014and for good reason.\n\nCloud-based systems will store all of your data and documentation in one\ncentralized platform. They\u2019re accessible from virtually anywhere, on multiple\ndevices. This makes it simple and quick to pull up the required documentation\nin real-time during an audit to demonstrate compliance.\n\nFurthermore, these systems enhance calibration processes by providing real-\ntime visibility into instrument status, calibration schedules, and historical\ndata. Constant access to data facilitates efficient monitoring and lends a\nhand when technicians need to make maintenance decisions.\n\nEmbracing the cloud also provides opportunities for further applications of AI\nand machine learning tools. Cloud-based access helps these programs leverage\nlarge amounts of data that can be anonymized and analyzed to learn more about\nmeasurement devices than ever before.\n\n### 4\\. Another Step Toward Industry 4.0 with Digital Calibration Certificates\n\nThe advent of the digital calibration certificate (DCC) may soon make\nconventional calibration certificates obsolete.\n\nA DCC isn\u2019t merely a scanned copy of a traditional paper-based certificate,\nsuch as a PDF. Rather, it provides all calibration information in an\nextensible markup language (XML) format, which is machine-readable. This means\nthat the information contained in a DCC can be transferred immediately to\ndigitally supported processes. Cryptographic signatures are used to verify the\nauthenticity of these certificates.\n\nA DCC\u2019s machine readability is particularly advantageous for production and\nquality monitoring processes. As manual creation and consolidation of data is\neliminated, it reduces errors in data transfer and calculations. In addition,\nthe automation facilitated by DCCs streamlines the production process,\nensuring that all parts meet specifications outlined in the DCC. Overall, this\ninnovation has great potential to enhance product quality and reliability.\n\n### 5\\. New Temperature Sensor Technology Cuts Calibration Time in Half\n\nRegulatory agencies like the FDA require pharmaceutical and biosciences\nindustries to routinely calibrate their temperature sensors. To comply with\nregulation, most plants schedule calibration every six months.\n\nBut sometimes sensors can drift out of alignment in between calibrations,\nleading to ruined fermentation batches that can cause huge company losses.\nFortunately, new technology has now made it possible for sensors to calibrate\nthemselves at the end of each batch, ensuring continuous accuracy in\ntemperature measurements. This frequent adjustment significantly reduces the\nrisk of fermentation batch failures and associated financial losses.\n\nManually calibrating sensors requires disconnecting and reconnecting the\nsystem\u2019s wiring, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. This is another\nway new advances help make the process more efficient. A technician can now\ntwist the top of a sensor to remove it instead of disconnecting wires, which\ncuts calibration time in half.\n\n### 6\\. Efficiency and Monitoring Through Remote or Touchless Calibration\n\nTouchless calibration denotes the remote transfer of standard reference data\nfrom calibration laboratories to the customer\u2019s facilities. The main objective\nis to provide real-time synchronized communication during the calibration\nprocess. This innovation collates information parameters from the calibration\nreference standard and shares them in real-time through a dedicated digital\nnetwork.\n\nWhile touchless calibration systems are still at a nascent stage, a 2022 study\nvalidated their ability to calibrate DC voltage. Today, touchless calibration\nis now being used in the shipping industry to monitor the conditions of\nperishables during transit. As this technology continues to evolve, its future\napplications in various industries hold promise for widespread adoption.\n\n### Demand for Precision Calibration on the Rise\n\nIncreased investment in calibration and the integration of advanced\ntechnologies significantly expands the possibilities. It\u2019s no surprise that\nthe global calibration services market is expected to witness a compound\nannual growth rate of around 5.6% from 2024 to the early 2030s.\n\nThis projected growth underscores the rising importance of precise calibration\nin diverse sectors, driving the demand for cutting-edge solutions and\ncontributing to the market\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\n##\n\nContinue Reading\n\n###\n\nSolving the contact resistance challenge for 7nm and beyond CMOS\n\n###\n\nFlash Memory Takes Over\n\n##\n\nSponsored Recommendations\n\n###\n\nNear- and Far-Field Measurements\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nIn this comprehensive application note, we delve into the methods of measuring\nthe transmission (or reception) pattern, a key determinant of antenna gain,\nusing a vector network...\n\n###\n\nDigiKey Factory Tomorrow Season 3: Sustainable Manufacturing\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nIndustry 4.0 is helping manufacturers develop and integrate technologies such\nas AI, edge computing and connectivity for the factories of tomorrow.
