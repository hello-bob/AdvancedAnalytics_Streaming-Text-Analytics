Studying the cosmic\n> evolution of the bar fraction in disc galaxies is therefore essential to\n> understand galaxy evolution in general. Previous studies have found, using\n> the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), that the bar fraction significantly\n> declines from the local Universe to redshifts near one. Using the first four\n> pointings from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Cosmic Evolution Early\n> Release Science Survey (CEERS) and the initial public observations for the\n> Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research (PRIMER), we extend the\n> studies of the bar fraction in disc galaxies to redshifts 1 \\leq z \\leq 3,\n> i.e., for the first time beyond redshift two. We only use galaxies that are\n> also present in the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey\n> (CANDELS) on the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) and Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) HST\n> observations. An optimised sample of 368 close-to-face-on galaxies is\n> visually classified to find the fraction of bars in disc galaxies in two\n> redshift bins: 1 \\leq z \\leq 2 and 2 < z \\leq 3. The bar fraction decreases\n> from \\approx 17.8^{+ 5.1}_{- 4.8} per cent to \\approx 13.8^{+ 6.5}_{- 5.8}\n> per cent (from the lower to the higher redshift bin), but is about twice the\n> bar fraction found using bluer HST filters. Our results show that bar-driven\n> evolution might commence at early cosmic times and that dynamically settled\n> discs are already present at a lookback time of \\sim 11 Gyrs.\n\nComments:| Accepted for publication in MNRAS; 18 pages, 10 figures; final\nversion includes new disc classification and mass cut, but results remain the\nsame; Figs. 6 and 7 summarise the main results  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2309.10038 [astro-ph.GA]  \n(or arXiv:2309.10038v3 [astro-ph.GA] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.10038arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \nRelated DOI:| https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae921DOI(s) linking to related\nresources  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zoe Ashleigh Le Conte [view email] [v1] Mon, 18 Sep 2023 18:00:04 UTC\n(2,647 KB) [v2] Wed, 20 Sep 2023 08:17:49 UTC (2,931 KB) [v3] Tue, 23 Apr 2024\n17:37:45 UTC (3,036 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled A JWST investigation into the bar fraction at\nredshifts 1 < z < 3, by Zoe A.
