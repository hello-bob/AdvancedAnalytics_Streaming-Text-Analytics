Her other son lives in event time: for him, what happens when, and for\nhow long, isn\u2019t dependent on the clock. \u2018It\u2019s about an internal sense of\nwhat\u2019s moving you forward,\u2019 says Avnet, a professor of marketing at Yeshiva\nUniversity in New York.\n\nClock-timers rely on an external cue to tell them when to start and finish\nwork, a hobby or a social engagement. If you are a clock-timer, you may wake\nup every day at 6:30 am, start working at 9 am, eat lunch at noon, go to the\ngym at 5 pm, and sleep at 10 pm. An event-timer might wake up when they\u2019re no\nlonger sleepy, eat when they\u2019re hungry, and work on a project until it\u2019s done\n\u2013 ending at no predetermined time.\n\nAvnet and her collaborator Anne-Laure Sellier, a professor of behavioural\nsciences at HEC Paris, have been studying clock time and event time for more\nthan 10 years, inspired by the differences in their own preferences. When the\ntwo met, they struck up a conversation about being late, and what time\nmeetings start at conferences. They slowly realised that the way they\norganised their lives was completely different.\n\nAvnet, like her older son, relies on the clock to structure her day. If she\nhas to complete a number of tasks, she divides out chunks of time she will\ndedicate to each one. When the time allotted for a task is over, she moves on\nto the next one. Sellier found that mysterious: she ended a task when it was\ncompleted and not before. \u2018I\u2019m completely event time,\u2019 she says.\n\nWe often plan our activities based on the clock out of necessity, so that we\ncan coordinate with friends or show up at the right time to a dentist\nappointment. But when it comes to how you would ideally plan your days, the\nresearch suggests that people differ, with some more drawn to clock time and\nsome more to event time. \u2018We\u2019re all born with a tendency to be one more than\nthe other,\u2019 Avnet says. This relationship with the clock affects more than\njust your to-do list; it may also be connected to how you experience your\nagency in the world and your emotional experiences in the moment.\n\nClock-timers rely more on external cues (such as calories) for deciding what\nto eat\n\nTo assess whether someone is more of a clock-timer or event-timer, Avnet and\nSellier will ask them about how they manage their schedules and tasks,\nincluding how much they agree with statements such as: \u2018When I make a\ntimetable for a task, I usually stick to it\u2019 (a sign of being a clock-timer)\nand \u2018I don\u2019t mind how long it takes to complete a task as long as it is done\nwell\u2019 (an event-time attitude). One way of managing your time is not\nnecessarily better than the other, but there are differences associated with\neach. Efficiency drives clock people, meaning they say their goal is to\ncomplete tasks in a set amount of time, and they say they value getting it\ndone. If a clock-timer gives themselves two hours to finish a task, when the\ntwo hours are over, the work is over. For an event-timer, effectiveness is\nmore the stated goal: they will finish working on a task when it feels like\nit\u2019s completed. They value doing the job well, not finishing it at a certain\npoint.\n\nWhen a person relies heavily on the clock to determine what to do and when to\nstop, research suggests they might also have a looser relationship with their\nown sense of control. This is because they look towards an external cue to\nguide their actions, according to Sellier, and that external cue, rather than\nsomething within them, is what seems to control the world around them. Event-\ntime people appear to believe, more than clock-time people do, that their\nactions make a meaningful difference in determining what happens to them.\n\nUsing the clock to guide what one does has also been linked to a lower\ninclination to savour positive feelings such as joy, gratitude and excitement.\nAvnet and Sellier have even found that clock-timers rely more on external cues\n(such as calories) for deciding what to eat, compared with event-timers. Avnet\nsays this is probably because clock-timers look outward to understand what to\ndo next, and so aren\u2019t as tuned in to their inner feelings.\n\nIn one study, people did a hot yoga class where poses were either held for a\ncertain number of minutes, with a clock in the room, or held for an\nundetermined amount of time without an external cue. The people who did the\nclock-time yoga class reported less positive emotion, and also struggled more\nwith the poses.\n\nIn event time, \u2018you feel more harmony with the world around you,\u2019 Sellier\nsays. You are likely to be more deeply engaged with what you are experiencing\nif you\u2019re not regularly looking to the clock to see if \u2018time is up\u2019.\n\nPeople perform better when they are able to adhere to the scheduling style\nthat works for them\n\nHumans have always had to devise ways to navigate time. There are calendars\nthat link time to which flowers are blooming or which vegetables are in\nseason. In ancient Egypt, a \u2018nilometer\u2019 was used to track time based on how\nhigh the Nile River was. \u2018There\u2019s nothing special about clock time, per se,\u2019\nsays Kensy Cooperrider, a cognitive scientist at the University of California,\nSan Diego who has studied different frameworks for keeping time. \u2018It\u2019s just\nthe uber-quantitative version that modern industrial societies have kind of\nsettled on, and is shared.\u2019\n\nWhen a scheduling style becomes shared, it can take on a moral quality. In a\nUS schoolbook from 1881, students were forced to read stories about the\nextreme consequences of tardiness: a train conductor crashes because he is\nlate, or a man\u2019s business fails. The lesson concludes:\n\n> The best laid plans, the most important affairs, the fortunes of\n> individuals, honor, happiness, life itself are daily sacrificed because\n> somebody is behind time.\n\nSince going by the clock is widely the prevailing mode at workplaces and\nschools, if you\u2019re an event-timer, it can feel like you\u2019re failing to match up\nwith the world around you.\n\nBut when people ask Avnet which kind of scheduling is best, she responds that\nneither is superior. What\u2019s helpful is to recognise your own preference and to\nmake use of that as best you can. Avnet and Sellier\u2019s work suggests that\npeople perform better when they are able to adhere to the scheduling style\nthat works for them.\n\nIn one study, Avnet and Sellier gave participants test questions to answer\nafter gauging their preference for clock time or event time. Some of the\nsubjects were given time limits for finishing their tests, with the timers on\ndisplay, while others were told they could take as long as they needed.\nEveryone finished the test at about the same time, but those who were clock-\ntimers did better when they had a set timeframe, while event-timers did better\nwhen there was no time limit.\n\nIn his book A Geography of Time (1997), the social psychologist Robert Levine\nexplained that, in many parts of the world, it is event time, and not clock\ntime, that rules work and social settings. At a wake held by the Mi\u2019kmaq\nIndigenous peoples in Canada, there are times for singing, prayer, and eating.\n\u2018The mourners simply move from one time to another by mutual consensus,\u2019\nLevine wrote. \u2018When do they begin and end each episode? When the time is ripe\nand no sooner.\u2019\n\nEvent-timers can be perfectionists, which contradicts the view that they are\neasy-breezy, free-floating people\n\nIn Sellier\u2019s home country, France, an event-time style is relatively\nprominent, she says. When there are research seminars in Paris, and the\nAmericans come to visit, Sellier says many of them are jumpy about what time\nthe talk should be starting. \u2018Because we never start on time,\u2019 she says. But\nthis is typical for an event-time culture: they start when it feels right to\nstart, after everyone has settled in and had some time to chat.\n\nWhen I worked in an office in the US with a traditional 9-to-5 schedule, I\nstruggled to work at the designated times. I preferred to write earlier in the\nmornings and take a break for yoga or a walk at the time when everyone else\nwas starting to work, and I was supposed to be logging on. Sometimes a task\ntakes me an inordinate amount of time, sometimes I complete it very quickly.\nEvent-timers can be perfectionists, Avnet says, which contradicts the view\nthat they are easy-breezy, free-floating people who live outside conventional\nrules.\n\n\u2018I know that today I\u2019m going to end my day at 6 pm, but my event-time\ncolleague might work until 10 pm, or she might end at 4 pm,\u2019 Avnet says.\nEvent-time people don\u2019t need the time to motivate them to do a job, but\nsometimes they overdo it. \u2018They don\u2019t know when to stop,\u2019 she says.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many people, suddenly working from home, were\nthrust into a situation that was more conducive to event time. They could\nmanage their schedules more flexibly and do their tasks when it felt right,\nand for as long as needed. Sellier thinks that this is one reason why many\npeople are resisting going back to the office full-time: they were event-\ntimers all along. (This applies only to people whose schedules actually became\nmore flexible. A day full of Zoom meetings at designated times is still\nquintessential clock time.)\n\nSellier hopes that one takeaway from this period is that, while clock time is\nuseful, it\u2019s not the only way to structure your time. Most people already\nblend both scheduling styles to some extent, but Sellier believes (with a\nlittle bias) that we could all use a bit more event time in our lives.\n\nAvnet and Sellier prove that a clock-timer and event-timer can work well\ntogether. \u2018The clock person keeps pushing the event person because there is a\ndeadline at the end,\u2019 Avnet says. \u2018On the other hand, the event person will\nsometimes say: \u201cWait, this is not ready, we have to go back and rethink some\nstuff.\u201d\u2019\n\nKnowing that one style isn\u2019t superior to the other, you can try to fit your\nwork and social life to the approach that suits you best. You could even\nexperiment a bit with the alternative style. For a more creative approach to a\nwork problem, try tackling it in event time \u2013 where there\u2019s no strict cut-off,\nand more solutions might emerge in the hours (or even days) past what would\nhave been your deadline. If your to-do list is getting out of hand, dedicate a\nclock-time period to it, to check items off your list that have been\nlanguishing a little too long. And, of course, there are non-work situations\nin which giving yourself flexibility in scheduling can be a boon. \u2018When I\u2019m on\nvacation,\u2019 Avnet says, \u2018I try not to be a clock person.\u2019\n\nSave\n\nShare\n\nPost\n\nEmail\n\nHabits and routinesFocus and attentionGoals and motivation\n\nSyndicate this idea\n\n30 April 2024\n\nEmotions\n\nidea\n\nHow \u2018feelings about thinking\u2019 help us navigate our world\n\nThe pleasant feeling of knowing, the frustration of forgetting, and other\n\u2018metacognitive feelings\u2019 serve as unsung guides\n\nby Pablo Fernandez Velasco & Slawa Loev\n\nMusic\n\nidea\n\nI learned to hear the music of Earth\u2019s underwater musicians\n\nIf we consider the sounds of whales and other organisms with an open mind, we\nfind a strange beauty \u2013 and can even join in\n\nby David Rothenberg\n\nThinking and intelligence\n\nidea\n\nPhilosophical reflection often begins with a disruptive mood\n\nFor many of our greatest philosophers, it was their moods, from wonder to\nestrangement to anxiety, that first inspired them\n\nby Steven Segal\n\nPsyche is a digital magazine from Aeon Media that illuminates the human\ncondition through psychology, philosophy and the arts.\n\n  * Therapeia\n  * Eudaimonia\n  * Poiesis\n\n  * Popular\n  * All topics\n\n  * About\n  * Contact\n  * Support\n\n\u00a9 Aeon Media Group Ltd. 2012-2024.Privacy PolicyTerms of UseRSS\n\nPsyche is published by registered charity Aeon Media Group Ltd in association\nwith Aeon America, a 501(c)(3) charity.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
