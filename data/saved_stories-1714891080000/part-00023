Everyone loves lightsabers. You can buy some nice\nreplicas, and there are even classes on lightsaber training. But what about an\nactual working lightsaber? What it would take to make a real one?\n\nToday, I'm going to focus on the power needed to run a lightsaber. How much\npower would it use, and what kind of battery would you need? (The issue of how\nyou can make a light beam with a finite shape that slices through things ...\nwell, we'll just set that aside for now.)\n\nFor this estimation, I'm going to look at Episode I: The Phantom Menace. In an\nearly scene, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) uses his lightsaber to cut through a\nthick metal door in a Trade Federation starship. There's a bunch of physics to\nconsider, so let's get started.\n\n## Power and Energy\n\nRemember in Episode IV when Darth Vader said, \u201cThe ability to destroy a planet\nis insignificant next to the power of the Force\u201d? He was talking about\nmilitary power, not physical power. Words are slippery\u2014just like the Force is\nnot the same as a force in physics. But to a physicist, power has a specific\nmeaning: It's the rate of energy use or transmission.\n\nWe can write this as the change in energy (\u0394E) with respect to a finite time\ninterval (\u0394t). If the energy is measured in joules and time in seconds, then\nthe power would be in units of watts.\n\nCourtesy of Rhett Allain\n\nSay you pick up a textbook off the floor and lift it to the level of a table.\nSince you're working against gravity, this would require about 10 joules of\nenergy. You'd use the same amount of energy whether you did it fast or slow,\nbut the power would differ. If it took you 10 seconds to lift the book, it\nwould require a power of 1 watt. If you did it in one second, that would be 10\nwatts. Same energy, different power. Right?\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

We\njust need to see some event in which we can estimate a change in energy over a\nmeasurable time interval. This is exactly what we see when Qui-Gon thrusts his\nlightsaber into that metal door.\n\n## Thermal Energy and Change in Phase\n\nTo increase the temperature of a cup of coffee, you need energy. In this case,\nwe call it thermal energy. The change in thermal energy of something like\ncoffee depends on the mass of the object (m), the change in temperature (\u0394T),\nand the \u201cspecific heat capacity\u201d (c) of the material.\n\nCourtesy of Rhett Allain\n\nJust to see how this works, imagine you take 300 grams of coffee (which is\nbasically water) and raise the temperature from 25 to 100 Celsius. This would\nrequire 94,000 joules\u2014as much energy as you'd need to lift that textbook 9,400\ntimes. You're appreciating that Mr. Coffee on your counter now, right?\n\nBut wait! If you melt a metal door, you aren't just raising the temperature\nbut also changing the phase of the material from a solid to a liquid. That's\nwhat melting does. The amount of energy required to change phases depends on\nthe mass of the object (m) and a property we call the latent heat of fusion\n(l_f).\n\nCourtesy of Rhett Allain\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car? Listen Up\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Science\n\nGet Ready for Monster Hurricanes This Summer\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Business\n\nWould You Still Use Google if It Didn't Pay Apple $20 Billion to Get on Your\niPhone?\n\nParesh Dave\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Breach of a Face Recognition Firm Reveals a Hidden Danger of Biometrics\n\nJordan Pearson\n\nMelting an ice cube takes 3.34 x 10^5 joules per kilogram. So a single ice\ncube with a mass of 50 grams would take 16,700 joules. You can already see\nthat melting stuff takes a bunch of energy. If you want to melt a metal door,\nyou have to do two things\u2014increase the temperature to the melting point and\nthen actually liquefy it. The total amount of energy depends on the mass and\ntype of the metal.\n\n## Estimating the Power\n\nNow we have to make some guesses. The big question is what starship doors are\nmade of. I mean, if I was making a giant spaceship to carry battle droids\naround, I think my metal of choice would be aluminum, which has a nice balance\nbetween weight and strength.\n\nLuckily, we know all about aluminum. It has a density of 2,700 kilograms per\ncubic meter and a melting temperature of 660 degrees Celsius. The specific\nheat capacity is 900 joules per kilogram per degree Celsius, and it has a\nlatent heat of fusion at 3.96 x 10^5 joules per kilogram. (I know that's a lot\nof numbers, but don't worry, we're just going to drop them into a computer.)\n\nWhat is the mass of the metal that's melted? That's a tough one. On Qui-Gon's\nfirst cut, it looks like he cuts a path about 2 meters long. I'm not sure\nabout the width of this path, but I'll go with 1 centimeter. Finally, the door\nis maybe 5 centimeters thick, and he's cutting all the way through in one\npass. With those estimations, I get a total mass of 2.7 kilograms of melted\nmetal.\n\nNow I can calculate the energy required to melt this amount of aluminum. It's\njust the energy needed to increase the temperature of the metal to the melting\npoint and then melt it. (Want to try the calculation with a different metal?\nJust plug your numbers into my Python code.) With my numbers, I get a required\nenergy of 2.6 million joules. Melting metal isn't trivial.\n\nNow, for the power, I just need to determine how long it takes to melt this\nmetal. Using Tracker Video Analysis, I get a cut time of 11.5 seconds. This\ngives a power output of 2.28 x 10^5 watts. Yes, that's the actual, physical\npower of the Force. It's equivalent to 305 horsepower, so it's like a high-\npowered car right there in your hand.\n\n## A Lightsaber Battery\n\nMaybe lightsabers don't have batteries. Maybe they just draw energy from an\nextra dimension or something. No one knows because lightsabers aren't real\n(and that's fine). But if they did have a battery, what would it look like?\nWhat kind of battery would work?\n\nWe already estimated the power output of the lightsaber. With this, we can\ncalculate the total energy stored in the device. We just need to know how long\nit will run on a single charge. I've never seen a lightsaber fizzle out in\nStar Wars, and I've never seen them plugged in to the wall, so I assume they\nlast a long time.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car? Listen Up\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Science\n\nGet Ready for Monster Hurricanes This Summer\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Business\n\nWould You Still Use Google if It Didn't Pay Apple $20 Billion to Get on Your\niPhone?\n\nParesh Dave\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Breach of a Face Recognition Firm Reveals a Hidden Danger of Biometrics\n\nJordan Pearson\n\nLet's just make a guess that a lightsaber can run for 10 hours. That's\nprobably a conservative estimate. So if the lightsaber outputs 2.28 x 10^5\nwatts for 10 hours, that requires a total stored energy of 8.2 x 10^9 joules.\nOof! That's the same as picking up a textbook 820 million times.\n\nCould you store that much energy with a lithium-ion battery like the one in\nyour phone? These cells can store 2.5 x 10^9 joules per cubic meter. Using our\nvalue for the stored energy, this means the battery would have a volume of 3.3\ncubic meters. That is ... daunting. A cylindrical handle to contain it might\nbe, for instance, 4 meters long and 1 meter in diameter\u201414 feet long and 3\nfeet thick. It would be like dueling with tree trunks or telephone poles.\n\nOn the other hand, remember what Yoda tells Luke: \u201cSize matters not.\u201d So who's\nto say.\n\nBut maybe we were wrong about the run time. Let's just use the dimensions of\nthe lightsabers we see in the movies. How about a handle 13 centimeters long\nand 6 centimeters in diameter? That would have a volume of 367 cubic\ncentimeters, which is about 0.01 percent the size of the one above. If\neverything is proportional, that would give us a run time of 4 seconds. In\nthis case, whoever's battery lasts longer wins.\n\nClearly, a lithium-ion battery isn't going to cut it. Using the reasonable\nhandle size above, we would need an energy density of 2.23 x 10^13 joules per\ncubic meter (or 2.23 x 10^4 megajoules per liter) to get the run time we want.\nLooking at a list of energy densities, the only thing that could work is some\ntype of nuclear battery or an antimatter source. I'd be fine with an\nantimatter battery. That would be complicated but super cool.\n\nBy the way, do you have a favorite lightsaber duel from the Star Wars movies\nand shows? Let me know. A lot of people cite the \u201cDuel of the Fates\u201d in\nPhantom Menace, when Darth Maul takes on Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi with\nhis double lightsaber. Ray Park, who played Darth Maul with psycho ferocity,\nwas a real-life black belt, and it shows.\n\nI put together a list of my top 5 lightsaber duels a few years ago. See if you\nagree.
