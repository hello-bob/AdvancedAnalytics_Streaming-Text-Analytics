The tab also has a list of recommended channels with similar topics\nwhere you can discover new content creators.\n\nWhen viewing posts from a channel, you can pull up to jump to the next unread\nchannel in your list. After hopping through all your channels, you can keep\nscrolling to browse recommended channels.\n\n> Channel recommendations are based only on the general topic of channels you\n> already subscribe to. So any predominance of particular types of vegetables\n> or fruit is entirely on you.\n\n#### My Profile\n\nYour Settings now have a 'My Profile' section that allows you to view your\nprofile as it appears to other users \u2013 and quickly edit or change any\ninformation.\n\nYou can now pin up to 3 stories to the top of your profile page \u2013 to showcase\nyour achievements or make sure nobody misses that cat in a suit you met in an\nelevator.\n\n> We've also added little icons that show the privacy settings of your posted\n> stories, so you can quickly see if they need adjustments.\n\n#### Birthdays\n\nAnyone can choose to add their birthday to their profile \u2013 letting all their\ncontacts know when to bring gifts. On your birthday, anyone who visits your\nprofile will be greeted with animated confetti and plenty of balloons.\n\nWhen it's someone else's birthday, a banner appears in your chat list \u2013 so you\nwon't forget to congratulate them. Don't worry if you forgot their gift, you\ncan tap the banner to quickly send a subscription to Telegram Premium.\n\n> By default, your date of birth is only visible to your contacts. Like other\n> information on your profile, birthdays have granular privacy settings which\n> you can control via Settings > Privacy and Security > Date of Birth.\n\n#### Channels on Your Profile\n\nIf you own a channel, you can now add it to your profile page. This places a\ndetailed preview of the latest post above your bio \u2013 sending visitors to your\npersonal project, online portfolio or company blog in one tap.\n\n#### Collectibles on Your Profile\n\nOwners of collectible usernames can link them to their Telegram account or\nchannels \u2013 listing the extra names on the profile page.\n\nTapping a collectible username or anonymous number on someone's profile now\npulls up extra info about the collectible \u2013 like when it was acquired and for\nhow much.\n\n> Collectibles can be bought and sold on the Fragment platform, which uses the\n> TON blockchain.\n\n#### Share Location Indefinitely\n\nWhen meeting up with friends or taking a trip, you can share your live\nlocation with individual users or entire group chats. This lets others follow\nyour journey \u2013 or even set an alert for when you arrive.\n\nNow you can add more time to an existing shared location. And if you want\nfriends and family to keep track of your movements for extended periods, there\nis a new option to share your location with them indefinitely, until you turn\nit off.\n\n> To start sharing your location, open the attachment menu in a private chat\n> or a group and select Location > Share My Live Location for....\n\n#### Reaction Notification Settings\n\nWe've added new settings that let you control notifications for reactions to\nyour messages.\n\nThis update also introduces notifications about reactions to your stories, so\nyou will never miss a heart again. (Or a flame. Or a thumbs up. Or a...\npigeon? Whatever that means.)\n\n> The new settings are available in Settings > Notifications and Sounds >\n> Reactions.\n\n#### Profile Pictures in Forwarded Messages\n\nForwarded messages now show the profile picture of the user from whom they\nwere forwarded. This makes them more recognizable in the chat \u2013 and makes it\neasier to read forwarded conversations with multiple authors.\n\nIf you limit who can link back to your account when forwarding, your profile\npicture will not appear on messages forwarded from you.\n\n> Tip: On Telegram, you can set a separate public photo that will be displayed\n> to users you don't know.\n\n#### Animated Emoji in Polls\n\nPremium users can now include animated and custom emoji in polls. At long\nlast, democracy can help decide whether animated ducks are better than static\ncats.\n\n#### Mass Moderation for Groups\n\nGroup admins can now select several messages and perform multiple moderation\nactions at the same time \u2013 in a new menu with individual toggles for each user\nand action to maximize efficiency.\n\nThe menu also has options to restrict user permissions instead of banning them\nfrom the community right away.\n\n> Admins of groups with 200+ members can also enable aggressive spam filtering\n> to automatically detect and restrict problematic users in their chat.\n\n##### Improved Recent Actions\n\nThe Recent Actions section lets group admins view notable events that took\nplace in the chat in the past 48 hours, like deleted or edited messages and\nadmin activity.\n\nWith this update, recent actions are now more compact, with similar actions by\nthe same admin grouped together. Admins can also see replies and to which\ntopics recent action messages belong.\n\n> We also fixed text highlighting when you search recent actions \u2013 now it\n> works just as well as when you search in regular Telegram chats.\n\n#### Reaction Management for Channels\n\nChannel admins now have an extra way to manage reactions \u2013 selecting a maximum\nnumber of reaction types each post can have to keep things tidy.\n\n> This allows channels to frequently change their available reactions (like\n> adding something relevant for a holiday), without a bunch of Easter bunnies\n> popping up on past posts.\n\n##### Unhide Ads\n\nBy default, subscribing to Telegram Premium hides ads in channels. If you wish\nto still see them \u2013 either to check your own ads or help channels earn\nrewards, there is a new toggle to show sponsored messages in Settings >\nTelegram Business.\n\n#### Open Stories Anonymously\n\nWhile viewing stories, Premium users can activate Stealth Mode in the story\nmenu to hide their recent views and continue hiding views for the next 25\nminutes.\n\nNow you can also activate Stealth Mode from the chat list \u2013 simply press and\nhold a story in your feed and select 'View Anonymously'. This opens the story\nwithout adding you to the list of viewers even for a second, and also turns on\nStealth Mode.\n\n#### Swipe for Next Topic\n\nWhen browsing groups that have topics enabled, you can pull up at the bottom\nof the chat to go to the next unread topic.\n\n#### Instant View on Telegram Desktop\n\nTelegram's cross-platform Desktop app now supports Instant View for websites \u2013\nopening the page and all its media directly in your app with zero load times.\n\n> If you ever find errors on an Instant View page, scroll to the bottom and\n> tap 'Wrong Layout?' to send us feedback.\n\n#### Rewards for Creators\n\nA new reward system has launched for channel owners \u2013 sharing 50% of the\nrevenue from ads shown in their channels. Withdrawals on Fragment are already\navailable for eligible channels \u2013 with no fees.\n\n> Users can promote their channel or bot by creating sponsored messages on the\n> Telegram Ad Platform \u2013 powered by the TON blockchain.\n\n#### 900 Million Users\n\nTelegram continues to be one of the most-used and most-downloaded apps in the\nworld \u2013 and now has more than 900 million monthly active users.
