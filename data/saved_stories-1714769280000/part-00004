Dean was fired by Spirit last year, and filed a complaint\nwith the Department of Labor alleging that his termination was in retaliation\nfor raising safety concerns.\n\nAccording to the Seattle Times, Dean was hospitalized after having trouble\nbreathing. He was intubated and developed pneumonia and a serious infection\nbefore dying two weeks later.\n\n\u201cHe passed away yesterday morning, and his absence will be deeply felt. We\nwill always love you Josh,\u201d Dean\u2019s aunt, Carol Dean Parsons, said via\nFacebook.\n\nDean was represented by the same law firm that represented Boeing\nwhistleblower John \u201cMitch\u201d Barnett. Barnett, 62, was found dead in March from\nwhat appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nBarnett spent almost three decades at Boeing, and told the New York Times in\n2019 that he had found \u201cclusters or metal slivers\u201d hanging over the wiring of\nflight controls that could have caused \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage if they had\npenetrated wires.\n\nHe alleged that management had ignored his complaints and moved him to another\npart of the plant.\n\nLast month, another Boeing whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, told Congress there\nwas \u201cno safety culture\u201d at Boeing, and alleged that employees who raised the\nalarm were \u201cignored, marginalized, threatened, sidelined and worse\u201d. He said\nhe feared \u201cphysical violence\u201d after going public with his concerns.\n\nUS regulators are now investigating Boeing after a mid-air door-panel blowout\nin January on a Boeing 737 Max 9.\n\nReuters reported last month that the justice department is now weighing\nwhether Boeing violated an agreement that shielded it from criminal\nprosecution over the fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\n  * In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.
