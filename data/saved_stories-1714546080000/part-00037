Previously, she was\na reporter at Bloomberg.\n\nApr 30, 2024, 6:59 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nCath Virginia / The Verge | Photos from Getty Images\n\nBinance founder Changpeng Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison for\nfailing to establish adequate anti-money laundering protections. Zhao, once\nthe head of the largest crypto exchange in the world, pleaded guilty in\nNovember 2023.\n\nJudge Richard Jones says that Zhao prioritized \u201cBinance\u2019s growth and profits\nover compliance with US laws and regulations.\u201d While Jones doesn\u2019t think Zhao\nis likely to reoffend, the scale of the crime is notable.\n\nBinance \u201cviolated US law on an unprecedented scale\u201d\n\nThough Zhao is not as well-known as FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, he is a\nmore important figure in the crypto world. The Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur\nfounded Binance in 2017. Though he was required to step down as CEO of the\nexchange as part of his plea agreement, he is still the controlling\nshareholder of the company, which one person told Bloomberg was \u201ca massive\nshitcoin casino.\u201d Binance listed many more tokens than competitors such as\nCoinbase.\n\nProsecutors requested three years of prison time, double the sentencing\nguideline of 18 months, because the \u201cscope and ramifications of Zhao\u2019s\nmisconduct were massive,\u201d they wrote in their sentencing memo. They also\nsuggested that Zhao\u2019s sentence should \u201creflect the significant harm to US\nnational security caused by his criminal acts.\u201d\n\nBinance allowed sanctions violations of more than $898 million, according to\nprosecutors, and \u201cviolated US law on an unprecedented scale.\u201d Zhao and other\nBinance executives didn\u2019t comply with US laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act\n(BSA), and didn\u2019t adequately implement anti-money laundering efforts. As a\nresult, Iranian customers were able to transact at least $1.1 million with US\ncustomers in violation of sanctions. Other sanctioned countries, such as Cuba\nand Syria, were able to transact as well.\n\nZhao\u2019s lawyers, in their own sentencing memo, said that Zhao deserved no jail\ntime, as \u201cno defendant in a remotely similar BSA case has ever been sentenced\nto incarceration.\u201d Zhao traveled from his home in the UAE to enter his guilty\nplea. He has remained in the US \u201caway from his home, partner, and young\nchildren for five and a half months,\u201d his lawyers wrote. Besides, Binance has\ntaken action to fix their anti-money laundering procedures, they wrote.\n\nIn the crypto world, Zhao has long been known as a cowboy with a reputation\nfor flouting US laws. In October 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of rival\nexchange FTX, tweeted (and deleted) that he was \u201cexcited to see [Zhao] repping\nthe industry in DC going forward! uh, he is still allowed to go to DC, right?\u201d\nA week after that, Zhao tweeted he\u2019d sell his holdings of FTX\u2019s token in\nresponse to a blockbuster story in CoinDesk. Since Binance had been an early\ninvestor in FTX, that was a pretty sizable amount. \u201cWe won\u2019t support people\nwho lobby against other industry players behind their backs,\u201d Zhao said.\n\nBy publicly broadcasting his trade, Zhao began the run on FTX that eventually\nrevealed the fraud at the exchange. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in\nprison in March after being found guilty in a jury trial of seven counts of\nconspiracy and fraud charges.\n\nZhao has already agreed to pay a fine of $50 million, a pittance compared to\nthe estimated $33 billion fortune he made with Binance. He also agreed not to\nappeal any sentence up to 18 months.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Razer made a million dollars selling a mask with RGB, and the FTC is not pleased\n\n  2. ## Elon Musk goes \u2018absolutely hard core\u2019 in another round of Tesla layoffs\n\n  3. ## FCC fines AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing location data\n\n  4. ## Binance founder\u2019s sentencing hearing\n\n  5. ## Automatic emergency braking at speeds up to 90mph required under new rule\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from this stream Crypto collapse: FTX\u2019s fall is one piece of a long,\ncold, contagious crypto winter\n\n  * ### Y\u2019all aren\u2019t going to believe this, but Coachella is doing NFTs again.\n\nMar 6, 2024, 1:51 AM UTC\n\n  * ### GameStop is pulling out of the NFT game.\n\nJan 13, 2024, 3:54 PM UTC\n\n  * ### First Bitcoin ETFs approved by US regulators\n\nJan 10, 2024, 9:45 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Sam Bankman-Fried won\u2019t face a second trial.\n\nDec 30, 2023, 2:35 PM UTC\n\nSee all 270 stories\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
