Learning the material\n\n  2. Learning the human elements of using the material\n\n###\n\nLearning the \u201cgame\u201d\n\nLooking at the soccer header image, first, you learn basic soccer skills:\npassing, trapping the ball, what various positions do, various ways to kick\nthe ball, general fitness, etc.\n\nKids Who Love Math is a reader-supported publication.

Polya, How to Solve It shows\n> anyone in any field how to think straight. In lucid and appealing prose,\n> Polya reveals how the mathematical method of demonstrating a proof or\n> finding an unknown can help you attack any problem that can be reasoned\n> out\u2014from building a bridge to winning a game of anagrams. How to Solve It\n> includes a heuristic dictionary with dozens of entries on how to make\n> problems more manageable\u2014from analogy and induction to the heuristic method\n> of starting with a goal and working backward to something you already know.\n>\n> This disarmingly elementary book explains how to harness curiosity in the\n> classroom, bring the inventive faculties of students into play, and\n> experience the triumph of discovery. But it\u2019s not just for the classroom.\n> Generations of readers from all walks of life have relished Polya\u2019s\n> brilliantly deft instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going\n> straight to the heart of a problem.\n\nThe University of Hawaii Math Department hosts a digital copy here:\nhttps://math.hawaii.edu/home/pdf/putnam/PolyaHowToSolveIt.pdf.\n\nHow to Solve It is all very well and good (and I highly recommend it), but the\npages and prose look like this:\n\nWhich can be helpful if you\u2019ve seen or at least played around with proofs,\nsequences, some geometry, and some basic algebra.\n\nBut for our kids in elementary school and middle school, it\u2019s going to be hard\nto get them to sit down long enough to work through it (even if we do it with\nthem).\n\n###\n\nSomething for the young(er) math kids\n\nSo here are some strategies that I\u2019ve slowly cobbled together that might work\nfor your kid when they are struggling with how to solve it.\n\n  * Look at what chapter/section you are in\n\n  * Look at what techniques you used in the last few problems\n\n  * Look at what techniques you used in the last chapter/section\n\n  * Write down all of the information that was given to you\n\n  * Draw a picture or diagram to visualize the problem\n\n  * Look at the previous problems\n\n  * How is your current problem similar to the previous ones\n\n  * How is your current problem different from the previous ones\n\n  * Can you break the problem down into smaller steps\n\n  * Think through the problem step-by-step by writing out each step\n\n  * Explain the problem out loud in your own words\n\n  * Is there missing information or instructions\n\n  * Did you miss any information or instructions\n\n  * What are the key numbers, variables, and unknowns\n\n  * Can you eliminate any options or ways you\u2019ve learned to solve problems (does this look like a multiplication problem?)\n\n  * Guess the answer and work backward to see if you can get the right initial conditions\n\n  * Look for a simpler, similar problem and build up in complexity\n\n  * What other multiple approaches can you use (visual, guess and check, estimate, make the numbers smaller)\n\n  * What other strategies have you not tried?\n\n  * Can you practice easier problems to see if there was a step that you didn\u2019t quite understand?\n\n###\n\nLearning math is hard so they\u2019ll get things wrong all the time\n\nLearning math is hard.\n\nWhen I got to college I asked one of my math professors what their job was\nlike.\n\nThey said reading math papers and trying to apply what they learned from\nothers to their own problems.\n\nI asked how long it took to read a paper and understand it enough to apply it\nto one's own problems.\n\nThey said about 1 page per day.\n\nI was shocked.\n\nThey said learning new math is hard, even if you\u2019re a math professor whose job\nis doing math.\n\nSo when my kids get upset that they can\u2019t figure out a problem or that they\ngot a wrong answer, I tell them it\u2019s not the end of the world and we go to the\n\u201csimple strategies\u201d above.\n\n###\n\nSelf-coaching\n\nThe ideal situation is that they slowly learn how to self-coach themselves.\n\nPer the sub-heading \u201cGetting stuck in a math problem and how to get unstuck.\u201d\n\nThey are going to get stuck, so it\u2019s important to start developing the\nmachinery for figuring out how to get unstuck.\n\nThe way to get unstuck is to be able to self-coach as they learn the material\nand try to use the new material.\n\n###\n\nWhat strategies have you found helpful?\n\nWhat did you find helpful to your math kids?\n\nWhat did you find helpful when you were growing up?\n\nPlease share in the comments below if anything comes to mind.\n\nThat\u2019s all for today :) For more Kids Who Love Math treats, check out our\narchives.\n\nStay Mathy!\n\nAll the best, Sebastian Gutierrez\n\n.\n\nKids Who Love Math is a reader-supported publication.
