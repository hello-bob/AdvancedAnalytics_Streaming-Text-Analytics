Python is an extremely versatile programming\nlanguage with a wide range of applications, from web development to data\nanalysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. By\nincluding Python with the base operating system, users can access the language\nwithout the need for additional downloads or installations, which may rely on\na separate team of people to deploy the software. Due to Python's ubiquitous\nnature on other platforms, this would serve to significantly lower the\nbarrier-to-entry for IT professionals to be useful and productive on the\nplatform while being effective on other platforms simultaneously.\n\nIdea priority| Medium  \n---|---  \n  \n  * Post comment\n\n  * Guest\n\nReply\n\n| Mar 13, 2024\n\nAs companion software, I suggest including Z Open Automation Utilities (ZOAU)\nwhich provides Python APIs. Also, offering enterprise support for the Python\nibm-db package for zDB2 access would be necessary.\n\n0 reply Hide replies\n\nBy clicking the \"Post Comment\" or \"Submit Idea\" button, you are agreeing to\nthe IBM Ideas Portal Terms of Use.
