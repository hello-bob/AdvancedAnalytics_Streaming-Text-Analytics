Facebook is\nundeniably cooked, a decaying, depressing hall of horrors full of viral AI-\ngenerated content that seemingly gets worse every day.\n\nBut I do not think Facebook is the dead internet. Instead, I think it is\nsomething worse. Facebook is the zombie internet, where a mix of bots, humans,\nand accounts that were once humans but aren\u2019t anymore mix together to form a\ndisastrous website where there is little social connection at all.\n\nI have spent more time than anyone I know endlessly scrolling through AI spam\non Facebook. I have watched the evolution of Facebook\u2019s AI spam go from\nslightly uncanny modifications of real images to the completely bizarre and\nobviously fake. I have done this from my own Facebook account, which I have\nhad since 2005, as well as from two burner accounts I created specifically to\ntrack how AI-generated content is recommended on the platform and to see\nwhether Facebook would put AI-generated images into my feed organically. I now\nuse Facebook exclusively to see what kinds of bizarre AI content is going\nviral, and to attempt to figure out who is making it, why they are making it,\nand who is interacting with it.\n\n## This post is for paid members only\n\nBecome a paid member for unlimited ad-free access to articles, bonus podcast\ncontent, and more.\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Sign up for free access to this post\n\nFree members get access to posts like this one along with an email round-up of\nour week's stories.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAlready have an account?
