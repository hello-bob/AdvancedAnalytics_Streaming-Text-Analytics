No matter where we come from, we're united by a common vision for\nthe future and a core set of values we think will get us there:\n\n  1. Focus on the mission\n\n  2. Demonstrate grit\n\n  3. Never stop learning\n\n  4. Pursue excellence\n\n# Job description\n\nQuilter is hiring a Senior to Staff level Reinforcement Learning (RL) Engineer\nto join our team.\n\nAlthough Quilter\u2019s automated circuit board design software is already the most\nsophisticated in the world, it is in many ways still in its infancy. Today,\nQuilter\u2019s completes the several intermediate steps in its circuit board design\nworkflow using a mix of traditional executable software and RL agents trained\nin specific contexts to complete narrow tasks at a superhuman level. In the\nlong term, our goal is to design boards end-to-end with RL-trained agents.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a talented RL Engineer who has significant experience\ndesigning, setting up, training, and successfully applying RL models and\noutputs in a commercial context. We need someone who can act as an extremely\ncapable senior owner who will own and solve some of the most complex and\nimpactful challenges on our technology roadmap. This is an opportunity to be a\nfoundational contributor to an extremely exciting commercial application of\nreinforcement learning, and to work with a focused and dedicated team of\nexperienced ML/AI researchers and engineers.\n\n# Requirements\n\n  * M.Sc. or Ph.D. (preferable) focusing on one or more of the following areas: Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, or a closely related field\n\n  * Demonstrated research publications in any of the major conferences\n\n  * Proficient with Python and C++.\n\n  * Proficient with PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n\n# What you\u2019ll do\n\n  * Develop reinforcement learning or imitation learning algorithms to tackle various parts of the board design pipeline\n\n  * Research new models and training algorithms that push the boundaries of complexity that our algorithms can currently tackle\n\n  * Apply modern techniques found in recent literature on applications of reinforcement learning to limited-data domains such as Robotics trained without simulation data\n\n  * Run Physics simulations to compute rewards for your agent to develop policies that optimize for ideal Electromagnetic and Thermal properties of PCBs\n\n  * Build production-grade environment that model the problem of PCB design for your agents to explore and exploit\n\n  * Validate your policies against our internal gauntlet of design benchmarks\n\n# What we value\n\n  * You are a jack of all trades - equally happy implementing a recent research paper, writing production grade environments and wrangling the infrastructure required for training\n\n  * You have significant experience with applying reinforcement learning in advanced research or production contexts (such as Robotics, Self-driving cars, Gaming)\n\n  * You have trained agents that have had to generalize across a wide set of environments or a wide set of control options\n\nPlease note: We are an equal opportunity employer and currently a remote-only\ncompany. At this time, we are focused on hiring primarily within the US, with\noccasional exception to accommodate exceptional talent.\n\n# What we offer:\n\n  * Interesting and challenging work\n\n  * Competitive salary and equity benefits\n\n  * Remote work with no commute\n\n  * Health, dental, and vision insurance\n\n  * Regular team events and offsites (~2x / year)\n\n  * Unlimited paid time off\n\n  * Paid parental leave\n\nWant to learn more about Quilter, our vision, and our investors?
