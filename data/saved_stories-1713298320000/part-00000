That could affect Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field\n\nSierra Solter\n\nOur ozone is pennies thick \u2013 and soon we\u2019ll put at least an Eiffel Tower\u2019s\nworth of metallic ash into the ionosphere every year\n\nShare\n\nA dead spacecraft the size of a truck ignites with plasma and pulverizes into\ndust and litter as it rips through the ionosphere and atmosphere. This is what\nhappens to internet service satellites during re-entry. When the full mega-\nconstellation of satellites is deployed in the 2030s, companies will do this\nevery hour because satellite internet requires thousands of satellites to\nconstantly be replaced. And it could compromise our atmosphere or even our\nmagnetosphere.\n\nSpace entrepreneurs are betting on disposable satellites as key to a new means\nof wealth. There are currently nearly 10,000 active satellites and companies\nare working as fast as possible to get tens of thousands more into orbit \u2013 for\na projected 1m in the next three to four decades.\n\n\u201cWe could get to 100,000 satellites in 10 to 15 years,\u201d Dr Jonathan McDowell,\nof the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told me. Those satellites\npower hyper-connected internet services and may turn some billionaires into\ntrillionaires \u2013 at the cost of shrouding the planet with toxic trash.\n\nSuper-intelligent aliens are going to destroy humanity? Whatever\n\nJoel Snape\n\nRead more\n\nThe problem is that space, contrary to popular belief, isn\u2019t really a giant,\nself-cleaning void. Space holds systems like the magnetosphere that keep us\nalive and supplied with oxygen by protecting our atmosphere. The space around\nour planet is a plasma cocoon that is cradling life.\n\nIt is easy to assume that the magnetosphere is too vast and robust for\nhumanity to ever have any impact on it, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I\u2019m a\nplasma physicist at the intersection of aerospace and physics and the author\nof recent research in peer-review that found that the space trash generated by\ndead and dying commercial satellites could compromise our ionosphere or\nmagnetosphere, also known as our planet\u2019s plasma environment.\n\nAfter studying the problem for over a year, I have no doubt that the sheer\nvastness of this pollution is going to disrupt our delicate plasma environment\nin one way or another. Yet few people are discussing this potential crisis \u2013\nin part, I suspect, because so much scientific research about space is\nintertwined with commercial space ventures, which have a vested interest in\navoiding these questions.\n\nUpon investigating just how much dust in the form of satellite and rocket\ndebris the space industry has dumped into the ionosphere during re-entry, I\nwas alarmed to find that it is currently multiple Eiffel Tower\u2019s worth of\nmetallic ash. I wouldn\u2019t have even been able to calculate that at all without\na scientist\u2019s personally run website. Our ozone is mere pennies thick, and\nsoon we will be putting at least an Eiffel Tower\u2019s worth of metallic ash a\nyear directly into the ionosphere. And all of that will stay there,\nindefinitely.\n\nHow could we possibly think that burning trash in our atmosphere 24/7 is going\nto be fine? Although some study is being devoted to stratospheric loading \u2013\nthe phenomenon of satellite and rocket chemicals saturating the atmosphere\nwith ozone-depleting alumina \u2013 humanity might also be forcing \u201cmagnetospheric\nloading\u201d on our planet, as well. No one else is currently studying the\npollution of the magnetosphere except for myself.\n\nWe don\u2019t even have a clear estimate of the mass of all regions in the\nmagnetosphere, yet we are going to load it with the wreckage of countless\ngiant spacecraft. These SUV-size satellites will soon be burning in the\natmosphere on an hourly basis. Unlike meteorites, which are small and only\ncontain trace amounts of aluminum, these wrecked spacecraft are huge and\nconsist entirely of aluminum and other exotic, highly conductive materials.\nAnd highly conductive materials can create charging effects and act as a\nmagnetic shield.\n\nIf all of these conductive materials accumulate into a huge layer of trash, it\ncould trap or deflect all or parts of our magnetic field. The Earth is a ball\nmagnet that we\u2019re surrounding with fast-moving metal trash. And so far,\nextrapolating from open-source data, the current trash in the ionosphere shows\nan apparent human-made electrostatic signature. It is known that individual\nspacecraft can perturb their environment with plasma wakes; imagine how\n100,000 or more of them and their associated trash could perturb the\nmagnetosphere.\n\nEven if we only induce ionospheric perturbations regionally \u2013 say, in\nspaceflight regions \u2013 then it could cause holes above the ozone. This in turn,\ncould allow atmospheric stripping, which could erode our atmosphere over time\nand put the planet at risk of losing habitability.\n\nLow Earth orbit is being promoted as a \u201cdestination and economy\u201d for\nsatellites and even low-gravity space hotels (which seem to be perpetually\n\u201ccoming soon\u201d and then canceled). People like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos\nrepeatedly state that space is the key to human longevity. But what if it is\nthe opposite? What if the space industry is the means to our pale blue dot\u2019s\ndemise? And what if all of this pollution that space entrepreneurs are\ncreating is happening in such a multidisciplinary, inaccessible, un-studied\nway that we don\u2019t even understand the risk?\n\nOur magnetosphere keeps us alive. It should be protected as an Earth\nenvironment. Instead, we\u2019re filling it with electronic waste so that\nbillionaires can trade electromagnetic signals for dollars they really don\u2019t\nneed.\n\n\u201cOur technical civilization poses a real danger to itself,\u201d Carl Sagan warned\nin his 1997 book Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the\nBrink of the Millennium. The magnetosphere is our first line of defense\nagainst an otherwise lethal solar system, and any pollution of it should be\nintensely studied and monitored. Indeed, if an asteroid the size of a Starlink\nsatellite was headed towards Earth, it would activate planetary defense\nmonitoring. But since it\u2019s a human-made object impacting the atmosphere, we\ndon\u2019t monitor it at all.\n\nSpace companies need to stop launching satellites if they can\u2019t provide\nstudies that show that their pollution will not harm the stratosphere and\nmagnetosphere. Until this pollution is studied further, we should all\nreconsider satellite internet.\n\n  * Sierra Solter is a plasma physicist, engineer, and inventor who studies the intersection of heliophysics and aerospace\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Science\n  * Opinion\n  * Space\n  * Satellites\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Jeff Bezos\n  * comment\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * The Guardian view\n  * Columnists\n  * Cartoons\n  * Opinion videos\n  * Letters\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
