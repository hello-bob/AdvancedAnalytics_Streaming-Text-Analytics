But the real threat lies with the\nleagues, special interests, and media outlets integrating addictive gambling\nwith the games we love.\u2019 Photograph: David Zalubowski/AP\n\nOpinionSport\n\n# The legalization of sports gambling in the US was a mistake\n\nBhaskar Sunkara\n\nThe Toronto Raptors\u2019 Jontay Porter was just banned for life for violating\nbetting rules. There will be much more of this to come\n\nShare\n\nOn Wednesday, the NBA announced that Jontay Porter, a center for the Toronto\nRaptors, was banned from the league for life. An investigation found that the\nbench player disclosed confidential information to gamblers, exited a match\nearly to influence an \u201cover/under\u201d wager on his stat line, and bet on games\nusing a friend\u2019s account.\n\nPorter\u2019s actions shouldn\u2019t be trivialized. Sport is an important part of our\nculture \u2013 and fair competition and the integrity of results are essential to\nit. But the real threat to sports and the livelihoods of billions of fans lies\nwith the leagues, special interests and media outlets integrating addictive\ngambling with the games we love. The profit-seeking corporate encouragement of\nthis behavior needs to be countered with strict federal regulation before an\nemerging public health crisis gets even worse.\n\nIn the 2010s, the Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, and the state of New\nJersey challenged the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (Paspa),\nwhich prohibited new state-sanctioned sports gambling. Legal books were\nlimited to a few grandfathered states, like Nevada. At the time, the scope of\nillegal sports gambling was unclear, with some putting the number at $50bn.\n\nThe US supreme court took on the case in 2018, ruling that Paspa was\nunconstitutional. Today, 38 states and the District of Columbia have made\nsports betting legal, with legislation pending in other areas. The dream of\nfigures like the NBA\u2019s Adam Silver, who immediately after becoming\ncommissioner in 2014 published a New York Times op-ed advocating legalization,\nwas fulfilled.\n\nThe early results have made billions for gambling companies, television\nnetworks, state governments, and players and owners alike. It\u2019s been a\nnightmare, however, for millions of ordinary people.\n\nWhen I bet on sports in high school, the process involved studying the Vegas\nlines in the Daily News and placing small bets with a local bookie. By\ncollege, it meant navigating to an offshore gambling site, possibly converting\nsome money to bitcoin, and placing a wager before the start of a match. Today,\ntechnology has changed things radically: we can seamlessly place bets on our\naddictive smartphones and we don\u2019t just bet before the games, we can bet on\nthe outcome of every play, with AI models generating odds in real time.\n\nSports betting apps store dozens of data points on every customer: they know\nwhat you like to bet on, when to send you push notifications, and what offers\ncan draw you back in if you haven\u2019t gambled in a while. Like any drug,\ngambling activates the brain\u2019s reward system. But most street-level dopamine-\npeddlers don\u2019t have access to the power of big data.\n\n> Legalization does not just bring black markets into the light of day \u2013 it\n> serves to radically expand markets\n\nNor do they have marketing departments. If you\u2019ve watched a sports game,\nthere\u2019s no doubt you\u2019ve seen advertisements from FanDuel, Draft Kings, BetMGM\nor any number of legal sportsbooks. They feature celebrities and athletes \u2013\npeople like Kevin Garnett, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Hart, Patton Oswalt and the\nentire Manning football dynasty \u2013 encouraging you to sign up and risk your\nwages. Podcasts at media networks like the Ringer are dedicated entirely to\nbetting. ESPN, owned by the conservative Disney corporation, has even gone to\nthe extreme of hosting its own sportsbook, ESPN BET.\n\nThe efforts are paying off. Last year, Americans legally wagered $120bn on\nsports, up 27.5% compared with 2022. And billions more are probably still bet\nillegally.\n\nThis sharp increase is a reminder that legalization does not just bring black\nmarkets into the light of day \u2013 it serves to radically expand markets. In\naddition to the social stigma that surrounded it, the barrier to entry for\nsports gambling used to be knowing a bookie and being willing to wager in\ncash. Then it became being tech-savvy enough to navigate sketchy offshore\nsites. Now it\u2019s just being 18 years old and having a smartphone and a credit\ncard.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that young people are suffering the most from legalization.\nAccording to a St Bonaventure/Siena Research survey, 39% of men and 20% of\nwomen aged 18 to 49 years old bet on sporting events. Among young men, 38% say\nthey\u2019re betting more than they should, 19% have lied about the extent of their\nbetting, and 18% have bet and lost money meant for meeting their financial\nobligations.\n\nGambling helplines have naturally been flooded. A recent 60 Minutes program\nnotes that in the five years since New Jersey legalized sports gambling, calls\nto the state\u2019s service has tripled, with the largest caller demographic being\nbetween 25 and 34.\n\nYet there seems to be no real constituency for tight federal regulation, much\nless prohibition. A libertarian-influenced Republican party is happy to\nsupport free markets, no matter their corrosive social effects.\n\nMany progressives are also more wary of punitive states than the actions of\npowerful corporations. Legalized gambling gives them more taxes to spend\nwithout trying to take it from the pockets of big business or wealthy\nindividuals. Never mind that the state is forced to absorb the externalities\ncreated by legalization and that the push has facilitated a redistribution of\nwealth from the poor to the rich.\n\nAdvances in artificial intelligence will only make online betting more\naddictive in the years to come, and no doubt this environment will create more\nJontay Porters in the future. Ultimately, Americans won\u2019t be able to take on\nthe powerful forces corrupting our culture until we decide we want to live in\na society that celebrates earning money, not winning it.\n\n  * Bhaskar Sunkara is the president of the Nation, founding editor of Jacobin, and author of The Socialist Manifesto: The Case for Radical Politics in an Era of Extreme Inequalities\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Sport\n  * Opinion\n  * Gambling\n  * Sport betting\n  * Basketball\n  * NBA\n  * Toronto Raptors\n  * comment\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Soccer\n  * NFL\n  * Tennis\n  * MLB\n  * MLS\n  * NBA\n  * NHL\n  * F1\n  * Golf\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
