This is expressed in statements such\nas:\n\nUsually successful startups happen because the founders are sufficiently\ndifferent from other people that ideas few others can see seem obvious to\nthem.\n\nhttp://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html\n\nEverybody\u2019s ideas seem obvious to them. I\u2019ll bet even John Coltrane or Richard\nFeynman felt that everything they were playing or saying was pretty obvious.\nSo maybe what\u2019s obvious to me is amazing to someone else?\n\nhttps://sive.rs/obvious\n\nFew understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new ideas seem\nmuch more conservative once they succeed. They seem perfectly reasonable once\nyou're using the new model of the world they brought with them.\n\nhttp://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html\n\nWhile my argument aligns with these perspectives, I argue that the concept I\npresent here is more precise and practically beneficial. I propose that we\nsplit creativity into two types: Explicit Creativity and Reflective\nCreativity. They are not degrees of the same kind, but completely different,\nyet people often lump them together under the label of 'creativity'.\n\nExplicit Creativity is considered an 'ability'. For instance, when a\ncreativity test asks you to write as many similarities between a chair and a\nbanana as you can think of, it's measuring Explicit Creativity. It's\nversatile, applicable to general tasks, and can be enhanced through learning\ntechniques or processes. Explicit Creativity applies to individual elements.\nExamples include problem-solving skills, adding new features to an existing\nproduct, or creating optical illusions in art.\n\nOn the other hand, Reflective Creativity is a byproduct of the creator's\nindividuality and world model, and does not fall under 'ability'. Reflective\nCreativity is perceived as creative because what seems obvious to the creator\nappears innovative to others. It does not apply to individual elements but\noperates integrally. It's harder to verbalize and tends to carry subtle, rich\nmeanings. Many innovative ideas seem to originate from Reflective Creativity.\nA favorite example of mine would be a passionate fan of anime girls and buses,\nwho wrote a detailed account of which buses the anime girls would be on -\nthis, I believe, falls under Reflective Creativity.\n\nBy distinguishing these two as separate entities, we can clearly identify\ntheir characteristics without confusion. Generally, the features we associate\nwith creativity pertain to Explicit Creativity. Reflective Creativity has\nunique traits separate from Explicit Creativity. Outcomes from Reflective\nCreativity can be hard to understand when examined individually, but make\nsense when viewed as a whole. Until others fully understand the underlying\nworld model or see the complete outcome, they might find it hard to grasp. If\nnot sufficiently explained, individual components may appear bizarre to\nothers.\n\nWhen considering these characteristics, the virtues of each type also differ.\nFor Explicit Creativity, the virtues align with common-sense rules for\nfostering creativity. For Reflective Creativity, one notable difference is\nthat it's more associated with a closed mind than an open one. Although being\nopen to new information is important, there are times when one must remain\nclosed off because people will often try to correct what they perceive as\nstrange ideas. To protect the idea, one might need to stay firm against\ncriticisms or ignore them (this might explain why fierce nerds, who might\nthink everyone else is stupid, often produce impressive results).\n\nLet's think about how we can practically apply what we've discussed. Often,\nthose with ideas rooted in Reflective Creativity face demands to conform.\nPeople will say things like \"If you're creative, you should do this because\nthis is what creative people do\" - in discussions or receiving user feedback,\nfor instance. If you're strongly inclined towards Reflective Creativity, this\nwill always happen. You'll need to be very cunning and very communicative to\nprotect your ideas. So, when faced with such remarks in the future, you can\nsay \"no\" (at least to yourself).\n\nMore generally, consider this guideline: If you can't sufficiently explain an\nidea that sprung from Reflective Creativity, expect people to misunderstand\nit.\n\nMethods for generating ideas from Reflective Creativity will also differ.\nIdeas from brainstorming sessions tend to be superficial or derivative,\noriginating from Explicit Creativity, and unlikely to be profound or\ninnovative. Direct approaches to ideate from Reflective Creativity will likely\nstruggle. How to further enhance Reflective Creativity? One way I know is to\nstrive to step out of the obsession of sounding plausible.\n\nReflecting on our discussion so far, you can devise strategies for working on\nReflective Creativity-based ideas. To preserve the essence of Reflective\nCreativity-based ideas, one person should lead the project, ensuring team\nmembers understand the underlying world model before progressing. There are\ntasks unsuitable for Reflective Creativity. For instance, collaboration can be\npoison if communication skills are not very good because it's hard to get\npeople to understand your idea before the outcome is complete. If you fail to\ndo this, you might just sound crazy to them, constantly receive criticisms,\nand struggle to keep your idea alive. Also, compromising might ruin the\noutcome more severely than in other cases because Reflective Creativity-based\nideas should be applied integrally. Even discussing or conversing with others\ncould be harmful. You must gauge their understanding level before considering\ntheir opinions \u2013 whether they understand the underlying world model or are\njust viewing the idea in isolation.\n\nThe post is over.
