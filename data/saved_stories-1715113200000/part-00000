Credit: Ourspace\n\nHELSINKI \u2014 The new Long March 6C rocket successfully inserted four satellites\ninto orbit late Monday on its debut flight.\n\nThe first Long March 6C rocket lifted off from Taiyuan Satellite Launch\nCenter, north China, at 11:21 Eastern, May 6 (0321 UTC on May 7). The Shanghai\nAcademy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST), the rocket\u2019s manufacturer, confirmed\nlaunch success within an hour of liftoff.\n\nFour satellites were aboard the launch. The main payload was Haiwangxing-1, or\nNeptune-1, an experimental, 239-kilogram X-band synthetic aperture radar\nsatellite. Neptune-1 was manufactured by SAST for Zhihui Space Tech. The\nlatter firm aims to launch 12 operational satellites for the Neptune\nconstellation.\n\nThe other satellites included Zhixing 1C, another SAR satellite, this time for\nBeijing-based Smart Satellite. The other two are described as wide-view\noptical and high-resolution video satellites. The mission was a SAST rideshare\nlaunch.\n\n> Haiwangxing-01, the main payload on the CZ-6C, is a 239 kg X-band SAR\n> satellite built by SAST for Zhihui Space Tech.

The rocket is capable of\nlifting about 2,400 kgs to a 500-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). The 6A\ncan carry 4,500 kg to a 700-km SSO. The variants provide greater launch\noptions and flexibility.\n\nThe launch was China\u2019s 20th of 2024 and follows the May 3 launch of the\nChang\u2019e-6 sample return mission. China aims to launch around 100 times this\nyear.\n\n## SAST\u2019s new rockets\n\nThe Long March 6C is not the only new SAST rocket expected to fly this year.\nThe academy is also planning to debut its 3.8m-diameter Long March 12 later\nthis year from a new commercial launch site at Wenchang. It will be capable of\nlifting 10 tons to low Earth orbit or 6 tons to a 700-kilometer sun-\nsynchronous orbit.\n\nThe rockets are part of a new generation of Chinese rockets that use kerosene\nand liquid oxygen instead of toxic, hypergolic propellant. However, access to\nspaceports capable of facilitating these launches has slowed the rate at which\nthe older Long March rockets can be replaced.\n\nThere are greater, yet more nebulous plans beyond the above. The academy aims\nto debut a 4.0-meter-diameter rocket in the next couple of years. It could use\nmethane-liquid oxygen engines developed by a commercial entity.\n\nA SAST promotional video released with today\u2019s launch shows the Long March 6A\nand 6C next to two further rocket models. Both future models appear to have\nlanding legs for recovery and reuse. It is unclear which rockets these are.\n\nSAST is a major institute under the China Aerospace Science and Technology\nCorporation (CASC), the country\u2019s state-owned main space contractor.\n\nBeijing-based China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) is CASC\u2019s\nother rocket design and manufacturing arm. CALT is developing the new Long\nMarch 10 reusable rocket for human spaceflight. One variant of which will be\ndesigned to send astronauts and a landing stack to the moon. The Long March 10\nwill be slowed by retropropulsion and caught by tight wires when in\nrecoverable mode.\n\n## Commercial reusability in China\n\nChina\u2019s efforts to develop reusable rockets do not stop there. The country\u2019s\ncommercial launch service providers are also working on reusable launchers.\nThese notably include Space Pioneer\u2019s Tianlong-3, which will be comparable in\ncapacity to the Falcon 9 and due to launch later in the summer. Landspace is\nworking on its Zhuque-3 stainless steel rocket at Jiuquan, while iSpace is\nalso developing a methane-liquid oxygen Hyperbola-3 rocket. A number of these\ncompanies have also conducted hop tests, along with SAST and CASC\u2019s sister\nentity CASIC.\n\nThe first orbital launch and landing attempt may however come from Deep Blue\nAerospace. The firm plans to launch its light-lift Nebula-1 rocket in the\nsecond half of the year. Galactic Energy is also working towards the first\nlaunch of the Pallas-1 kerosene-liquid oxygen rocket. The first flight,\nexpected later this year, is likely to be expendable.\n\nCompany| Rocket Name| Rocket Type| Key Features or Notes  \n---|---|---|---  \niSpace| Hyperbola-3| Methane-liquid oxygen reusable| Payload capacity of 8,500\nkg to Low Earth Orbit (LEO); first flight planned for 2025.  \nLandspace| Zhuque-3| Methalox reusable| Payload capacity up to 21,000 kg to\nLEO; first flight planned for 2025.  \nGalactic Energy| Pallas-1| Kerosene-liquid oxygen reusable| Payload capacity\nof 5,000 kg to LEO, or 3,000 kg to a 700 km sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).  \nCAS Space| Kinetica 2| Kerolox reusable| Payload capacity of 7,800 kg to 500\nkm SSO.  \nDeep Blue Aerospace| Nebula-1| Kerolox reusable| Payload capacity of 1,000 kg\nto 500 km SSO; first flight planned in late 2024.  \nSpace Pioneer| Tianlong-3| Kerolox| Comparable to Falcon 9 in launch\ncapability; plans for a reusable first stage.  \nOrienspace| Gravity-2| Kerolox| 25,600 kg to LEO. First flight in 2025; plans\nfor a reusable first stage.  \nCASC| Various| Various| Working on reusable rockets including a new-generation\nhuman-rated launcher, spaceplane, and Long March 9 super heavy-lift launcher.  \n  \nNon-exhaustive list of planned Chinese reusable rockets.\n\n### Related\n\n#### Long March 6A launches second Yunhai-3 satellite\n\nChina added to its fleet of secretive meteorological satellites with the\nlaunch of Yunhai-3 (02) late Tuesday.\n\n#### China\u2019s 2024 space plans include 100 launches and moon sample return\nmission\n\nChina is planning a national record 100 orbital launches in 2024, according to\nthe country\u2019s main space contractor.\n\n#### China launches first of a new series of Yaogan reconnaissance satellites\n\nChina launched its first Yaogan-42 satellite late Tuesday, adding to the\ncountry\u2019s growing military satellite reconnaissance capabilities.\n\nTagged: CASC, China, Long March 6C, rideshare, SAR, SAST\n\n## Andrew Jones\n\nAndrew Jones covers China's space industry for SpaceNews.
