We did not have supercomputers back\nthen, of course, but plenty of very complex calculations have always been done\nat Los Alamos; sometimes by hand, sometimes by tabulators from IBM that used\npunch cards to store and manipulate data \u2013 an early form of simulation. The\nfirst digital computer to do such calculations at Los Alamos was called MANIAC\nand was installed in 1952; it could perform 10,000 operations per second and\nran Monte Carlo simulations, which use randomness to simulate what are\nactually deterministic processes. Los Alamos used a series of supercomputers\nfrom IBM, Control Data Corporation, Cray, Thinking Machines, and Silicon\nGraphics over the following four decades, and famously was home of the\npetaflops-busting \u201cRoadrunner\u201d system built by IBM out of AMD Opteron\nprocessors and Cell accelerators, which was installed in 2008 and which\nrepresented the first integration of CPUs and accelerators at large scale.\n\nMore recently, Los Alamos installed the $147 million \u201cTrinity\u201d system in 2015,\ncomprised of Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi CPUs from Intel with a combined 2 PB of\nmemory and Intel 100 Gb/sec Omni-Path interconnect. Trinity was noteworthy\nbecause offloading the results of calculations from that large amount of\nmemory required a burst buffer so the machine could keep on calculating. The\nreplacement for Trinity, which was installed in August 2023, is the\n\u201cCrossroads\u201d supercomputer, which is based on Intel\u2019s \u201cSapphire Rapids\u201d Xeon\nSP processors with HBM2e stacked memory and HPE\u2019s Slingshot interconnect.\n\nBoth Los Alamos and its neighbor Sandia National Laboratories have been eager\nto foster the creation of Arm servers that can be clustered into\nsupercomputers, and Los Alamos has been driving the memory bandwidth per core\nwith the ill-fated ThunderX4 Arm server project at Cavium (and then Marvell).\nNeither the \u201cTriton\u201d ThunderX3 or the ThunderX4 ever saw the light of day, and\nso Los Alamos cajoled Intel to create the HBM variant of Sapphire Rapids, and\nalso did its part in convincing Nvidia to create the \u201cGrace\u201d CG100 Arm server\nchips that is paired with its current \u201cHopper\u201d GH100 and GH200 GPU\naccelerators and, soon, its future \u201cBlackwell\u201d GB100 and GB200 accelerators.\n\n### On The Hunt For The Memory Stag\n\nVenado which means deer or stag in Spanish and is also the name of a peak in\nNew Mexico\u2019s Sangre de Cristo mountains, and that is where the new machine\ngets its name. As you might expect, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is the prime\ncontractor on the system, and as we expected, the system does not make use of\nthe NVLink Switch shared memory interconnect for GPUs that Nvidia has created\nto make superpods of shared memory GPUs.\n\nThere was some talk two years ago when the Venado system architecture was\nbeing formalized that Los Alamos might want to use InfiniBand, not HPE\u2019s\nSlingshot variant of Ethernet, inside of a Cray \u201cShasta\u201d XE supercomputer\nsystem with Grace-Grace and Grace-Hopper compute engines, but as it turns out,\nLos Alamos is deploying 200 Gb/sec Slingshot 11 interconnects. Our guess? HPE\nSlingshot 11 with 200 Gb/sec per port is a whole lot cheaper than Nvidia\nQuantum 2 InfiniBand with 400 Gb/sec ports.\n\nThe new Venado system is not a workhorse machine in the Los Alamos fleet, but\nan experimental one that is built from its own budget and for the express\npurpose of doing hardware and software research. Most of the machines that Los\nAlamos acquires are proposed, built, accepted, and put immediately to work on\nworkloads for the National Nuclear Security Administration that manages the\nnuclear weapons stockpile for the US military.\n\nBack in May 2021, here is what we knew about Venado officially from the\nannouncement:\n\nWe also learned from talking to Jim Lujan, HPC program manager, and Irene\nQualters, associate laboratory director of simulation and computation at Los\nAlamos, that the basic idea was to do an 80/20 split on compute cycles between\nthe two architectures. Meaning 80 percent of the flops would come from the\nGPUs (and we assumed this was done at FP64 precision to carve the compute pie\nup) and 20 percent would come from the GPUs.\n\nConsidering that in regular GPU-accelerated machines, 95 percent to 98 percent\nof the flops are coming from GPUs, this Venado machine looked quite a bit\nheavier on the CPU than you might otherwise expect. For good reason, as Gary\nGrider, HPC division leader at Los Alamos for the past two and a half decades\nand, among many other things, the inventor of the burst buffer, tells The Next\nPlatform.\n\n\u201cOur applications are these incredibly complex multiphysics, multi-link scale,\nextreme multi-resolution, incredibly complex packages with millions of lines\nof code that run on half the machine for six months to get an answer,\u201d Grider\nexplains. \u201cThat\u2019s normal for us, which is not true of many other Department of\nEnergy labs, if any. They might do it as an unusual thing, but not normally.\nThe reason that it takes six months to run those applications is because the\naccess to memory is so incredibly sparse and irregular because of the\ncomplexity of what they are trying to do \u2013 the applications re trying to run a\nproblem that is 50 times bigger than the machine. And so that ends up being\nthe driver for the kinds of machines we buy for our simulation environment\nbecause we have these needs. And it ends up being the reason why we don\u2019t buy\nvery many GPUs because GPUs are really good if you can do dense linear\nalgebra. But if you are doing everything sparse and irregular, and everything\nis an index lookup and the like, then they are no better than the CPU, really.\nIt is truly more about how much memory bandwidth you can buy per dollar than\nit is about how many flops you can buy.\u201d\n\nIt was convenient, perhaps, that the hyperscalers and cloud builders running\ndeep learning recommendation systems (DLRMs) on GPUs also needed a way to\ncache larger amounts of embeddings for those recommenders than could be held\nin the GPU HBM memory, and the answer Nvidia came up with was Grace, a\nglorified, computational memory controller for an additional 480 GB of LPDDR5.\n\nWhat is not a coincidence, perhaps, is that two 72-core Grace chips connected\nby NVLink ports formed into a superchip has 960 GB of memory capacity and 1\nTB/sec of memory bandwidth into those Arm \u201cDemeter\u201d V2 cores etched into the\nGrace chip. And thanks to four 128-bit SVE2 vector engines per V2 core, the\nGrace-Grace superchip can deliver 7.1 teraflops of aggregate peak FP64 compute\nall by themselves. Under normal circumstances, when the GPUs are doing most of\nthe compute, you would have thought Nvidia would use less heavily vectored\n\u201cPerseus\u201d N2 cores from Arm. We think Los Alamos in the US and CSCS in\nSwitzerland with the \u201cAlps\u201d system, pushed Nvidia to go with the V2 cores. And\nthanks to the relatively few cores in the Grace CPU, the relatively cheap and\nlow-power LPDDR5 memory, and the relatively fat 480 GB of available memory,\nGrace has a good balance of memory bandwidth per core and low cost per unit of\nmemory bandwidth.\n\nThe Grace CPUs, which we detailed here, have sixteen LPDDR5 memory controllers\neach with a total of 546 GB/sec of memory bandwidth and 512 GB of capacity.\nThe delivered version of Grace has only 480 GB of memory and only 500 GB/sec\nof bandwidth. Go figure. The two CPUs in a Grace-Grace superchip are linked to\neach other coherently over a 900 GB/sec NVLink chip-to-chip implementation\n(C2C in the chiplet lingo). That same NVLink C2C interconnect is used to hook\na Grace CPU to a Hopper GPU with 80 GB or 96 GB of HBM3 or 141 GB of HBM3E\ncapacity, depending on which model you buy.\n\nAnyway, based on what we knew about Grace and Hopper back in May 2022 and\ndoing an 80/20 split on compute, we did some back of the envelope math and\nfigured you would need 3,125 Grace-Hopper nodes and around 1,500 Grace-Grace\nnodes. The Grace CPUs have more FP64 oomph than many expected \u2013 again, we\nthink this is intentional and driven by HPC customers, not AI customers \u2013 and\nthe upshot is that the actual Venado system has 2,560 Grace-Hopper nodes and\n920 Grace-Grace nodes.\n\nIf you do the math on that, there are a total of 316,800 Grace cores with a\ntotal of 15.62 petaflops of peak FP64 performance. The Grace CPUs in the\nVenado nodes have a total of 2 PB of main memory. (Huh, do you think that is a\ncoincidence? We don\u2019t. It is the same amount of memory as the Trinity system.)\nThat LPDDR5 memory has an aggregate of 2.1 PB/sec of bandwidth.\n\nThere are 2,560 Hopper GPUs in the box, with a combined 85.76 petaflops of\nFP64 performance on the vector cores and 171.52 petaflops of FP64 performance\non the tensor cores. That\u2019s 92 percent of FP64 on the Hoppers and 8 percent on\nthe Graces if you use the tensor cores on the H100s, but it is 85 percent on\nthe Hopper if you only use the vector cores. We presume that those Hopper GPUs\nhave 96 GB of HBM3 memory each, for a total of 240 TB of HBM3 memory and 9.75\nPB/sec of aggregate bandwidth. If you do the math further, then 81 percent of\nthe memory bandwidth of the machine is on the Hopper GPUs but an amazing 19\npercent is on the Grace CPUs.\n\nAs part of the contract with HPE, the Venado system will be equipped with a\nLustre parallel storage cluster that resides on the Slingshot network, and\nGrider says that Los Alamos is looking to also try out the DeltaFS file system\nand perhaps others with the machine.\n\nGrider says that Venado is installed and running now, and acceptance should\ncome in the next two months \u201cunless there\u2019s some gotcha that happens\nsometimes,\u201d and there should be lots of applications running on the\nexperimental machine by July or so.\n\n#### Sign up to our Newsletter\n\nFeaturing highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to\nyour inbox with nothing in between.

In fact, it could be argued\nthat you have it exactly backwards, as the numbers used in Monte Carlo are\nusually not random at all, but pseudo-random (aka deterministic).\n\nReply\n\n  2. Matt says:\n\nApril 15, 2024 at 11:26 pm\n\nA Monte Carlo method may be used to find a numerical approximation for a\ndeterministic model. An example: Pi is a mathematical constant. The area of a\ncircle is deterministic. The area, A, of a circle is uniquely determined by\nits radius, r, with the formula A = pi*r^2. By (pseudo)randomly sampling\npoints from a uniform distribution from a square with side length r and\ntesting whether they are inside or outside a circle inscribed in the square,\none can find a numerical approximation of the area of the circle with radius r\nby multiplying the area of the square, r^2, by the fraction of points found to\nlie inside the circle. Noting the area formula for the circle, A = pi*r^2, the\nfraction of points found to lie within the circle yields an approximation of\npi.\n\nReply\n\n     * Timothy Prickett Morgan says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 8:21 am\n\nI do believe that is what I said originally without being anywhere near as\nprecise. Monte Carlo is a kind of magic as far as I am concerned. It is an\napproximation, and sometimes nature is perhaps a bit more precise than we are.\nBut that you can take randomness and do predictions at all is the amazing\nthing.\n\nReply\n\n  3. HuMo says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 5:07 am\n\nGreat to see that Santa\u2019s red-nosed rocket sleigh is now officially gambolling\nabout, even as LANL elves get it ready for acceptance of upcoming christmas-\npresent workloads! Its trendy heterogeneous configuration is wildly\nreminiscent of recent partitioned animals grazing in this field, like the Mare\nNostrum 5 GPP (CPU only) and ACC (CPU+GPU). It does seem a bit smaller though\n(as wild deer can be relative to mares?), with its 316,800-strong slender-yet-\ngracious core (vs 725,760 for the GPP mare\u2019s xeons; and also 660,800 xeon\nmax\u2019s at the LANL Crossroads).\n\nIts PF/s 101 (15.6+85.8) could prove an interesting intro into heterogeneous\ngift delivery, seeing (for example) how a hopper full of Oh\u2019Henri\u2019s chocolate\nbars was the #1 Green500 favorite last year (yummy!). More to the point\nthough, its targeted ability to efficiently graze through sparsely distributed\nNorth Pole tundra lichens should directly translate into great performance at\ndispatching christmas lumps of coal to the equally sparse naughty kids of the\nworld! With 1.5x as many cores as Japan\u2019s meteorological twins (PRIMEHPC\nFX1000), one may expect a top 20 or better 0.7 PF/s standing for this HPCG\ntask, somewhat similar to the Wisteria\u2019s Odyssey, but with a potential boost\nfrom the rocket engines of its matrix hoppers (helping it hop-along quicker!).\n\nAll in all a quite interesting animal, sure to be more power-thrifty than its\nupcoming Swiss cheese cousin from the Alps, itself better adpated to the dense\ngrassy pastures found there (running at 445 PF/s in this ecosystem), but\nlikely somewhat equivalent in sparse tundras (IMHO)! Cant\u2019 wait to see its\nblinking red nose in the sky! 8^b\n\nReply\n\n     * Timothy Prickett Morgan says:\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 8:24 am\n\nIt is about having more memory per core and much lower cost per memory\nbandwidth, I think.\n\nMaybe Intel and AMD should have LPDDR5 Xeons and Epycs with a 16 or 24 memory\ncontrollers as an option? Or even 32 or 48 using Eliyan PHYs? How much work\ncould a CPU with proper memory configuration with lots of vector and matrix\nengines do? I am gonna have a think about this....\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
