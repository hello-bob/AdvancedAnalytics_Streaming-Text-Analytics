We wanted to\nreflect on Blacksmith\u2019s journey through the W24 batch. Buckle up, this is\ngoing to be a long read.\n\n## Pre-YC\n\nWe meandered through a number of ideas for about 9 months before getting into\nYC. We would typically do a bunch of legwork for an idea before either losing\nconviction, realizing it wasn\u2019t a good fit for our skill sets, or realizing\nthat it was simply a bad idea.\n\nOne evening we were getting dinner, and complaining about the state of CI at\nour respective jobs, as engineers do. We realized we all dealt with very\nsimilar pain points, despite being at companies in very different stages and\nsegments of the market. We walked away from this conversation feeling like the\nCI compute space (which is a big chunk of the cloud compute market) was\nunderserved by the traditional clouds. Over the next few weeks, as we did more\nresearch, our conviction in the space continued to grow. In late November, we\nstarted playing around with some of the ideas that have come to underpin\nBlacksmith.\n\nAs we were doom-scrolling Twitter in early December, we came across this tweet\nfrom Dalton.\n\nBy this point, we\u2019d spent enough time on Blacksmith to know that we wanted to\nwork on this full time. However, we felt that we were way too early and were\nhonestly a little scared about actually taking the leap to do our own thing.\nWe rationalized that we were going to build Blacksmith sooner or later anyway\nand getting into YC would just accelerate that timeline. Looking back, we are\nvery glad we followed our gut and applied.\n\nFast forward to two weeks later, we were in! When Jared Friedman offered us a\nspot, we accepted immediately.\n\n## Moving to SF for YC\n\nWe spent the rest of December figuring out the logistics of moving our lives\nto SF for the duration of the YC batch.\n\nThe two big rocks were:\n\n  1. Finding a place in SF: YC recommended several furnished apartments, but since we were late, none of their suggestions were available. We ended up finding an Airbnb in Bernal Heights (with a *very* nice coffee shop in the neighborhood).\n\n  2. Pets: We\u2019re a very pro pet company with four pets in total - three cats and a dog. Moving them to SF was not an option, so we had to figure out alternate arrangements to make it work.\n\n## What YC has to Offer\n\n### Money\n\nYC invests $500k into your startup, where $125k is for 7%, and the remaining\n$375k is on an \u201cuncapped MFN SAFE\u201d (i.e. at the next financing round\u2019s\nvaluation). YC wires you the $500k upfront. This is very founder-friendly and\nis enough to give most founding teams almost 2 years of runway.\n\n### Cohort\n\nYC splits everyone into four groups. Each group had 50-60 companies headed by\ntwo group partners and two visiting partners. The group was further split into\nsections of 10 companies based on the product area. We were in the \u201cdev tools\u201d\nsection and met every two weeks for group office hours. By the end of the\nbatch we formed a pretty strong bond with the folks in our section.\n\n### Office Hours\n\nEvery company in the batch has group office hours with their section, and 1:1\noffice hours with their respective YC partners. Group office hours were\nthematic and involved sharing updates about our progress as a group. We\u2019d also\nuse this time to bounce ideas off of people and share things we were\nstruggling with.\n\nOne of our favourite parts of YC were the 1:1 office hours with Jared and\nNate. They gave us honest feedback about what we could be doing better,\nespecially around pipeline generation and growth. Since Nate had previously\nbuilt Lever, he had a lot of expertise in enterprise sales, which was\ninvaluable for us as a company trying to sell a piece of infra to other tech\ncompanies.\n\nThe office hours added implicit pressure to make consistent, measurable\nprogress on some dimension every two weeks. No one wants to show up to their\nnext office hours without new updates to share.\n\n### Bookface\n\nPeople in YC also get access to Bookface, their internal social network. Think\nof it like a StackOverflow for startups. As a first-time founder, Bookface is\nan absolute godsend. In addition to the community, it gives you access to a\nknowledge base of articles covering topics like incorporation, fundraising,\nhiring, and generally most things you\u2019ll run into when setting your company\nup.\n\n### Peer Pressure (the good kind)\n\nYC brings with it a sense of urgency and intensity to get a lot done in 3\nmonths. This had a few implications. It meant:\n\n  1. If you have an idea you have conviction in, build it quickly, talk to users, and try to grow it\n\n  2. If you\u2019re going to pivot, pivot quickly\n\nMany companies, including ourselves, didn\u2019t have a product fully built before\nthe batch but had a working product with many customers by the end of the\nbatch. We also know folks who pivoted multiple times but finally landed with\nsomething they deeply believed in.\n\n### Customers\n\nIf you\u2019re in YC and are building something for startups, it\u2019s a fantastic\nplace to get early customers. You have unrestricted access to 200 companies,\neach with $500k in funding. Some of the most successful YC companies like\nDeel, Pulley, and Brex got their start this way, and continue to get steady\ninbound from each YC batch.\n\nEven though early stage startups weren\u2019t our ICP, many of our batch mates were\nwilling to try Blacksmith out to give us mileage and early feedback.\n\n### Our YC launch\n\nEvery company in the YC batch does at least two launches: a \u201cLaunch Bookface\u201d\nand a \u201cLaunch YC\u201d. Launch YC is when YC makes a dedicated post about your\ncompany from its official LinkedIn and Twitter accounts. Your group partners\nwill push you to do these launches, as soon as possible, and often way before\nyou\u2019re comfortable putting your product out there.\n\nThis is a big opportunity to get early users for most companies since YC has\nmillions of followers across their social media accounts. We wanted to time\nour Launch YC to be about a week before we were going to start our fundraising\nconversations with investors. We had a fairly successful launch and we got a\nnumber of early customers (total strangers!) signing up and running their CI\non us.\n\nThis launch had some fortuitous second-order effects. A random developer, with\na large twitter following, happened to discover Blacksmith and tweeted about\nus.\n\nGreg\u2019s tweet went semi-viral, and we received a sizeable inbound response,\nleading to some more customers. All this gave us a good deal of growth and\ntraction going into fundraising.\n\n## Fundraising\n\nThe YC machine is built around helping companies raise a seed round towards\nthe end of the batch. We would summarize the benefits as:\n\n  1. Tailored advice for fundraising\n\n  2. A ton of inbound interest from VCs and angels\n\n  3. A large angel network of ex-YC founders\n\n  4. Allowing companies to compress their fundraise into a window of 2-4 weeks\n\n  5. Raising at a higher cap\n\nWe took about 70 calls in the 2 weeks we spent fundraising. We decided to\nfirst front-load angel calls from friends & family and YC alumni, to give us\nsome momentum before we started talking to bigger institutional funds. Our\ninitial calls were very successful \u2014 the angels we spoke to were relatively\nhigh conviction and a quick 30 min chat would often lead to a $50k check.\n\nAfter this initial bout of success, things started to get rough \u2014 we were\nreally struggling to calibrate our pitch to the various kinds of institutional\nfunds we spoke to. We realized a key difference between angels and\ninstitutional funds: angels are usually investing on \u201cvibes\u201d, whereas bigger\nVCs often have an \u201cinvestment thesis\u201d, create \u201cmarket maps\u201d and then\ncategorize your company into a bucket within a market. Our pitch was generally\nnot congruent with this thought process and so a lot of investors found it\nhard to think about us within their framework.\n\nOver time, we got better at calibrating our pitch to the investors we were\ntalking to, and started seeing some success. By the end of the second week, we\nhad our first lead investment offer! The moment we let firms know that we had\na lead investment offer, our conversion rate with them went from near-zero to\nover 80%. Once we were closer to making a decision, YC was again incredibly\nhelpful. Jared went out of his way, even over the weekend, to get on the phone\nwith us and help us negotiate.\n\n## Just apply\n\nOnce in a while, there\u2019s discourse online, particularly Twitter, on whether or\nnot to apply to YC. If you\u2019re a first-time founder, we would say it\u2019s a no-\nbrainer. We strongly believe it gives you an unfair advantage when building\nyour company. They stay true to their word about constantly pushing you to\nmake something people want and not falling into traps like hiring and scaling\ntoo early before PMF.\n\nBlacksmith\n\nTerms of Service\n\n", "frontpage": true}
