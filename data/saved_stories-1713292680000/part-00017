We\nhave only two lists, Today and Later. Pick what you have time to do Today from\nthe Later list. What you didn\u2019t have time to finish, will silently move back\nto the Later list, until you are ready.\n\nFollow or contact us on Instagram or X (Twitter). Read our blog @ Medium.\n\nTerms\n\nhi@tdy.do\n\n", "frontpage": false}
