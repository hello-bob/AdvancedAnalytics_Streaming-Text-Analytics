Some of these mention there\u2019s research which backs up the claims.\nBut is this food tip as good as social media influencers suggest?\n\nThe science behind it is actually sound, albeit a little confusing. But the\nactual health effects are not nearly as significant as they\u2019ve been made out\nto be.\n\nWhen bread is cooked, it transforms the moist, bubble-filled dough into a soft\nfluffy loaf. The heat of the oven, combined with the water in the dough,\ncauses the starch in the flour to expand and gelatinise. The same thing\nhappens when flour is added to a sauce and cooked until it thickens.\n\nThese gelatinised starches are easier to digest, making the glucose (sugars)\nthat these starches contain easier for our cells to get hold of. This is true\nof many freshly cooked starchy foods, particularly those low in fibre or made\nfrom finely milled flours \u2013 such as white bread or potatoes.\n\nSome evidence suggests that this kind of rapidly available glucose might\nincrease insulin levels just after eating. Although insulin is important as it\nhelps our cells use glucose for energy (or store it for energy later), too\nmuch insulin could cause you to feel hungrier and possibly even gain weight.\n\nBut when foods containing these gelatinised starches are cooled, the expanded\nstarches shrink back down, becoming what\u2019s known as a resistant starch. These\ncollapsed starches are harder for the enzymes in our digestive tract to break\ndown \u2013 which means its also harder for our cells to get hold of the sugar\nthese starches contain. This means resistant starches are less likely to cause\na blood sugar and insulin \u201cspike\u201d after eating them.\n\nThe degree to which resistant starch is able to form depends on the baking\ntemperature of the bread and whether it\u2019s then refrigerated or frozen. The\nrate of contraction is nearly twice in the freezer as it is in the\nrefrigerator, meaning that more resistant starch will be formed.\n\nPlus, freezing bread traps the water in \u2013 keeping it fresher and softer than\nif you stored it in the fridge, where water will be lost causing the bread to\ngo hard.\n\n## Should you freeze your bread?\n\nA study on ten healthy people looked at the effect of freezing white bread\nthen toasting it. They compared store-bought loaves with homemade bread.\n\nFor samples of homemade bread, freezing and thawing the bread reduced how much\nit spiked blood sugar by 31% over two hours. Interestingly, toasting fresh\nbread also lowered the rise in glucose by 25%.\n\nThis effect was even greater when the homemade bread was frozen, thawed, then\ntoasted \u2013 reducing the blood sugar response by 39%. This effect could\npotentially help with hunger, as glucose and insulin levels will not rise as\nhigh after eating the frozen bread.\n\nNot all bread is equal. morkovkapiy/ Shutterstock\n\nBut when commercial, store-bought white bread was used, freezing before\ntoasting did not improve the body\u2019s blood sugar response. This could reflect\nthe different ways in which commercial bread is made compared to homemade\nbread. The ingredients used or the way the loaf is cooked then cooled may\nreduce the effect of freezing on the formation of resistant starch. The\nevidence is not completely clear.\n\nOther, more recent research, has also shown similar results. So, although some\nof the studies are small, the effect that freezing bread has seems consistent,\nand thoroughly investigated in the lab.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that these effects only exist for a couple of hours\nafter eating the bread. So while freezing your bread before eating it may help\nlower blood sugar levels at one meal (and have a small effect on the next meal\ntoo), the long-term effects on appetite, weight gain or risk of certain\ndiseases (such as type 2 diabetes) is not known \u2013 and is likely to be very\nsmall.\n\nResistant starch can be found in many other cooked and chilled starchy foods\nsuch as potatoes, pasta and some (but not all) types of rice. Basmati rice in\nparticular seems to form more resistant starch than fluffier types of rice\n(such as arborio rice).\n\nAs well as being harder to breakdown than freshly cooked starch, resistant\nstarch provides nutrients to the microbes living in our colon. This helps\nmaintain a healthy balance of bacteria in our gut. These bacteria then release\nchemicals onto the cells lining the colon which help us to maintain a healthy\nmetabolism.\n\nResistant starch has also been shown to help insulin work better by increasing\ninsulin sensitivity somewhat. This can help our bodies use blood sugar more\nefficiently, which is linked to better health, as they can be used more\neffectively as a fuel by our muscles.\n\nThe benefits of resistant starch may even extend to other aspects of our\nmetabolism, as it may also help lower cholesterol. This effect is thought to\nbe caused by the short-chain fatty acids the gut bacteria produce when they\nferment resistant starches. Lower cholesterol levels may mean lower risk of\nheart disease.\n\nWhile these changes may seem quite dramatic they are short term, so their\neffects on our long-term health is more modest. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\nshouldn\u2019t still freeze your bread. Putting a loaf of bread in the freezer can\nreduce food waste with the added bonus of some health benefits \u2013 even if\nsmall.\n\n  * Insulin\n  * Blood sugar\n  * Resistant starches\n  * Bread\n  * Educate me\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Scheduling Analyst\n\n  * ##### Assistant Editor - 1 year cadetship\n\n  * ##### Executive Dean, Faculty of Health\n\n  * ##### Lecturer/Senior Lecturer, Earth System Science (School of Science)\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
