Chair Lina Khan referenced on Tuesday some of the stories she had\nheard from workers.\n\n\"We heard from employees who, because of noncompetes, were stuck in abusive\nworkplaces,\" she said. \"One person noted when an employer merged with an\norganization whose religious principles conflicted with their own, a\nnoncompete kept the worker locked in place and unable to freely switch to a\njob that didn't conflict with their religious practices.\"\n\n### Business\n\n### Noncompete Agreements Are Everywhere, Even Neighborhood Yoga Studios\n\nThese accounts, she said, \"pointed to the basic reality of how robbing people\nof their economic liberty also robs them of all sorts of other freedoms.\"\n\nThe FTC estimates about 30 million people, or one in five American workers,\nfrom minimum wage earners to CEOs, are bound by noncompetes. It says the\npolicy change could lead to increased wages totaling nearly $300 billion per\nyear by encouraging people to swap jobs freely.\n\n### Business\n\n### Many workers barely recall signing noncompetes, until they try to change\njobs\n\n### Business\n\n### Flight attendants don't earn their hourly pay until aircraft doors close.\nHere's why\n\nThe ban, which goes into effect later this year, carves out an exception for\nexisting noncompetes that companies have given their senior executives, on the\ngrounds that these agreements are more likely to have been negotiated. The FTC\nsays employers should not enforce other existing noncompete agreements.\n\nThe vote was 3 to 2 along party lines. The dissenting commissioners, Melissa\nHolyoke and Andrew Ferguson, argued that the FTC was overstepping the\nboundaries of its power. Holyoke predicted the ban would be challenged in\ncourt and eventually struck down.\n\n### Business\n\n### These companies tried a 4-day workweek. More than a year in, they still\nlove it\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has vigorously opposed the ban, saying that\nnoncompetes can benefit both companies, by allowing them to better guard trade\nsecrets, and employees, by giving employers greater incentive to invest in\nworkforce training and development.\n\n  * noncompete agreements\n  * Lina Khan\n  * competition\n  * FTC\n  * employment\n  * Federal Trade Commission\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### Elections\n\n#### How voters from different economic sectors see the 2024 election\n\n##### Economy\n\n#### Sleep training: Life preserver for parents or \"symptom of capitalism\"?\n\n##### Climate\n\n#### Talks for a plastic pollution treaty are stalling.
