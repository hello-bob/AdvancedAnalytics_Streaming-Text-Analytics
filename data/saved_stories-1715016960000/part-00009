Now the\ncompany's repeatedly defensive and dishonest responses to charges that its\nspecially equipped Street View cars surreptitiously collected private internet\ncommunications -- including emails, photographs, passwords, chat messages, and\npostings on websites and social networks -- could signal a tipping point.\n\nWith the phenomenally successful and profitable internet giant being newly\nscrutinized by consumers, competitors, regulators and elected officials alike,\nall concerned about basic issues of privacy, trust and anti-trust, the\nquestion must be raised: Is Google facing an existential threat? With\ngovernment regulators nipping at its heels on both sides of the Atlantic,\nFacebook leading in the race for attention and prestige, and \"social\"\nbeginning to replace \"search\" as a focus of online activity, the company that\nrevolutionized our means of finding information just a decade ago now finds\nitself increasingly under siege and in danger of fading from prominence to\nbecome, in essence, the \"next Microsoft.\"\n\nWho gave these new media companies the right to invade our privacy without our\npermission or knowledge and then secretly store the data until they can figure\nout how to profit from it in the future?That possibility came into sharper\nfocus recently when fed-up European regulators gave the company an ultimatum\n-- change your lying ways about your anticompetitive practices in search,\nonline advertising and smartphone software or face the consequences.\nRegulators in the United States are poised to follow suit.\n\nMeanwhile, the secret Street View data collection has already led to inquiries\nin at least a dozen countries. Yet Google still refuses to 'fess up and supply\nan adequate explanation of what it was up to, why the data was collected and\nwho knew about it. To date, no domestic regulator has even seen the\ninformation that Google gathered from American citizens. Instead, Google chose\nfirst to deny everything, then blamed a programming mistake involving\nexperimental software, claimed that no use of the illicit data in Google\nproducts was foreseen, and said that a single \"rogue\" programmer was\nresponsible for the whole imbroglio. The Federal Communications Commission\n(FCC) determined instead that the data collection was no accident, that\nsupervisors knew all about it and that Google in fact \u201cintended to collect,\nstore and review\u201d the data \u201cfor possible use in other Google products,\u201d and\nfined Google for obstructing the investigation.\n\nGoogle's response to the FCC was not unusual. At every step of the way, the\ncompany has delayed, denied and obstructed investigations into its data\ncollection. It has consistently resisted providing information to both\nEuropean and American regulators and made them wait months for it -- as well\nas for answers as to why it was collected. Company executives even had the\ntemerity to tell regulators they could not show them the collected data,\nbecause to do so might be breaking privacy and wiretapping laws! As Bradford\nL. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, told The New York Times while citing\nGoogle's stated mission to \"organize the world's information and make it\nuniversally accessible and useful,\" it seems \"Google's practice is to prevent\nothers from doing the same thing.\"\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 17 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

Who gave these new media companies the right\nto invade our privacy without our permission or knowledge and then secretly\nstore the data until they can figure out how to profit from it in the future?\n\nNo one, obviously ... and as a direct result of their arrogant behavior, both\nGoogle and Facebook now face the possibility of eventual showdowns with\nregulators, the biggest to hit Silicon Valley since the US government went\nafter Microsoft more than a decade ago. Their constant privacy controversies\nhave also caused politicians to begin taking notice. Senator Al Franken of\nMinnesota, for example, who is in charge of a subcommittee on privacy, noted\nin a recent speech that companies such as Google and Facebook accumulated data\non users because \"it's their whole business model. And you are not their\nclient; you are their product.\"\n\nSmall wonder that Google co-founder Larry Page is feeling \"paranoid\", as the\nAssociated Press recently reported. Why? As I detail in my new book Friends,\nFollowers and the Future: How Social Media are Changing Politics, Threatening\nBig Brands and Killing Traditional Media, as the new \"contextual web\" takes\nthe place of the data-driven web of the early 21st century, it will mean\nfurther bad news for Google -- even though the company still sold $36.5\nbillion in advertising last year. Couple Google's paranoia about Facebook and\nthe evident failure of its latest social network, Google Plus, with its\nproblems about privacy, trust and anti-trust, and it's no surprise that\nexecutives are feeling paranoid. After all, they are facing the very real\nprospect of waging a defensive war on many fronts -- social, privacy, and\ntrust -- simultaneously. Despite its incredible reach, power and profit, it's\na war that Google -- the 21st century equivalent of the still-powerful but\nincreasingly irrelevant Microsoft -- may well be destined to lose, along with\nthe trust its users have long extended to one of the world's most powerful\nbrands.\n\nEditor: Caitlin Roper\n\nTopicsGoogleWiredOpinion\n\nRead More\n\nA New Surveillance Tool Invades Border Towns\n\nPlus: An assassination plot, an AI security bill, a Project Nimbus revelation,\nand more of the week\u2019s top security news.\n\nDhruv Mehrotra\n\nHow to Stop Your Data From Being Used to Train AI\n\nSome companies let you opt out of allowing your content to be used for\ngenerative AI.
