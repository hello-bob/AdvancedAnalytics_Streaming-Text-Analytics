Prove that anyone can make $1M in 12 months with just a phone.\n\nThe story of Mike Black and what happened next: ^\n\nIn 2020, @theMikeBlack1 made a bold move.\n\nHe drained his bank account to zero, left his 7-figure business, and went\nhomeless.\n\nAll to prove that anyone can come back from rock bottom and inspire others. He\npublicly committed to the challenge. ^\n\nThe early days tested Mike's resolve. He slept on benches, battling hunger and\ndoubt.\n\nBut he knew this was bigger than him\u2014it was about showing others what's\npossible.\n\nFailure wasn't an option. Mike had to find a way, no matter how hard it got. ^\n\nA turning point came when a stranger on Craigslist let Mike crash in his RV.\n\nIt wasn't much, but it gave Mike a chance to regroup and strategize his next\nmove.\n\nHe used this small window of opportunity to plan his comeback. And he wasted\nno time... ^\n\nMike got resourceful. He started flipping free items from Craigslist, acting\nas the middleman for profit.\n\nEvery dollar went straight to survival. He stacked odd jobs on\ntop\u2014telemarketing, assistant work, delivery.\n\nBrick by brick, he was making his comeback\u2014or so he thought. ^\n\nRock bottom hit hard when Mike's bank overdrew, and he found himself sleeping\nin a roach-infested RV.\n\nMost would throw in the towel here. For Mike, it only fueled his fire.\n\nComfort was the enemy. This was the ultimate motivator to turn things around,\nand fast. ^\n\nA $1500 marketing gig became Mike's lifeline. He moved into a shared room,\nsaving every penny.\n\nRemember the RV kid? Mike bought the vehicle back for $2K and asked to repay\nthe favor.\n\nWith a small safety net, he could finally focus on building something\nbigger... ^\n\nMike zeroed in on creating a scalable e-commerce biz. Not just any biz, but\none with heart.\n\nHe launched a coffee brand for dog lovers that donated proceeds to animal\nrescues.\n\nStill, he had to juggle this with marketing clients and documenting his\njourney. Sleep became a luxury. ^\n\nTo fund his venture, Mike made bold sacrifices. He rented out his room and\nlived for free.\n\nEvery extra dollar went straight into the business. He was all in, no Plan B.\n\nFinally, he launched the brand. The machine was in motion. But then, a\ndevastating blow... ^\n\nMike's dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. His world shattered.\n\nHe dropped everything to be with his family, but he knew his dad would want\nhim to keep going.\n\nSo he dug deep, channeled his pain into purpose, and kept building. Failure\nwas not an option. ^\n\nBack at it with renewed focus, Mike went full throttle. He implemented\nsubscription model for recurring revenue.\n\nHe commissioned viral videos to spread the word. Some days, he woke up to\nhundreds of new orders.\n\nThis was it. Momentum was building. Then, another crushing setback. ^\n\nTwo severe autoimmune diseases and a tumor left Mike in daily agony.\n\nHe was running on fumes, barely able to function. Doubt crept in\u2014could he\nreally keep going?\n\nThat's when a message changed everything... ^\n\nA stranger reached out, saying Mike's story stopped him from ending his life.\n\nAt that moment, it clicked. This wasn't about hitting $1M. This was about\ninspiring others and showing them what's possible.\n\nMike couldn't stop now. Too many people were counting on him. ^\n\nStill, Mike had to cut things short.\n\nHe made $65K, a far cry from $1M but still a massive feat for someone who\nstarted from zero.\n\nTrue achievement? Building a viable business in weeks. Overcoming shitty odds.\nTouching lives.\n\nMoney comes and goes. But impact\u2014that lasts forever. ^\n\nIf you got something from this...\n\nJoin Eddie\u2019s Extracts to get daily emails about how to achieve your goals\nquickly and effortlessly:\n\njoin.eddiecheng.com ^\n\nEddie's Extracts Join Eddie's Extracts to get daily emails about how to get\nresults easily. https://join.eddiecheng.com/\n\nQuick thank you to @leonjhendrix for the banger thumbnail.

By middle\nschool, he had already decided on his life plan:\n\nTo become Japan's most successful businessman.\n\nAt just 16, Son moved to the US to pursue his dreams. But after enrolling in\nhigh school, he realized it was taking too long.\n\nSo he convinced his school to let him take the college entrance exam early.\n\nDespite being underprepared, he scraped through and headed to UC Berkeley.\n\nRead 18 tweets\n\n#### EDDIE CHENG\n\n@ecomEddie\n\nApr 4\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand marketing, you\u2019ll never be truly wealthy.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about how Apple does killer marketing that always\nmakes billions:\n\nSpeak The Customer's Language\n\nApple doesn't bore you with specs and jargon\u2014they focus on benefits and\nexperiences.\n\nThey say \"Retina Display,\" not \"high pixel density.\" \"1000 songs in your\npocket,\" not \"5GB of storage.\"\n\nNobody cares about the technicality, only the outcome.\n\nSimplicity Sells\n\nApple practices simplicity in everything they do.\n\nFrom product design to advertising, they strip away the unnecessary and focus\non the essence.\n\nThe result? A streamlined experience that customers can't resist.\n\nRead 21 tweets\n\n#### EDDIE CHENG\n\n@ecomEddie\n\nApr 2\n\nThis is Elon Musk.\n\nHe runs 5 billion-dollar companies, has 11 kids, and still has time to\nsh*tpost on Twitter.\n\nI had to know how he manages his time.\n\nHere\u2019s what I found:\n\nTime is the very fabric our lives are woven from. How you spend your days is\nhow you spend your years.\n\nWe each have around 4,000 weeks in our lives\u2014which is not a lot.\n\nThe best time managers recognize the scarcity of this resource:\n\nOne common mistake is trying to gain total mastery and control over time.\n\nWe often feel if we just optimize enough, we can bend time to our will.\n\nBut this is an impossible feat\u2014time will always march on.\n\nSo, how do you break free from the time-wasting trap?\n\nRead 27 tweets\n\n#### EDDIE CHENG\n\n@ecomEddie\n\nMar 29\n\nI\u2019m obsessed with learning how to think.\n\nSo, I spent 100+ hours studying how Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Naval Ravikant\nthink clearly.\n\nHere are 21 logical fallacies to avoid if you want your reasoning to be\nairtight:\n\nAd Hominem\n\nLatin for \"to the person.\"\n\nAn ad hominem fallacy attacks the arguer, rather than the argument itself.\n\nIt insults the individual, questions their motives, and calls their character\ninto question\u2014in the hopes of diverting from the actual reasoning.\n\nStraw Man\n\nThis fallacy misrepresents an opponent's argument, making it appear weaker\nthan it is.\n\nNext, it argues against the distortion, before claiming victory over the\nweakened \u2018Straw Man\u2019.\n\nHere\u2019s a perfect example of this:\n\nRead 27 tweets\n\n#### EDDIE CHENG\n\n@ecomEddie\n\nMar 22\n\nThe root of procrastination isn\u2019t laziness, it\u2019s fear.\n\nIf you struggle with procrastination, read this:\n\nEvery time you put something off, you're flooding your system with toxic\nstress hormones.\n\nThis chronic stress:\n\n\u2022 Weakens your immune system \u2022 Disrupts your physiology \u2022 Puts you at risk for\nillness\n\nProcrastination literally makes you sick.\n\nTrue happiness and fulfillment come from pursuing meaningful, self-directed\ngoals.\n\nHowever, when you procrastinate on those goals, you rob yourself of that deep\nsatisfaction.\n\nThis keeps you stuck in a cycle of mediocrity.\n\nHere\u2019s a clip that explains this better:\n\nRead 23 tweets\n\n#### EDDIE CHENG\n\n@ecomEddie\n\nMar 20\n\nElon Musk once said, \u201cIt\u2019s possible for ordinary people to choose to be\nextraordinary.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t happen because of their intelligence, net worth, or their\nbackground.\n\nIt\u2019s something much more simple:\n\nGrowing up Asian, hard work and achievement were everything.\n\nLike everyone else, I thought the greatest achievement was landing a cushy\ncorporate job.\n\nBut as I grew older, I knew I wanted more.\n\nI just didn't know what that \"more\" was yet.\n\nSchool didn\u2019t help me figure it out either.\n\nThe problem is that school teaches you what to think, not how to think for\nyourself.\n\nYou optimize for the system instead of thinking outside of it. The result?\n\nYou're molded by the system, never knowing your true strengths.\n\nRead 24 tweets\n\n## Did Thread Reader help you today?\n\nSupport us!
