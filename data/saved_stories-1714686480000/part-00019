He\nhad brought clay animation back to life. But his creations, once animated on\nsilver screens, were now housed in cardboard boxes, frozen in various states\nof bewilderment.\n\nOver thirty years, Vinton had built his firm, Vinton Studios, into a\n$28-million-a-year enterprise. He\u2019d produced, directed, and brought to life\nthe most memorable characters of the 80s and 90s \u2014 the California Raisin,\nThurgood Stubbs, the \u201cRed and Yellow M&Ms.\u201d He not only coined the term\n\u201cclaymation,\u201d but was its unheralded king.\n\nAnd now he was in the board room, tracing over the language that seized his\nkingdom. Hours earlier, he\u2019d handed over his company and all of its trademarks\nto Nike co-founder Phil Knight. The billionaire\u2019s son, an animation intern and\nex-rapper with no management experience, would be assuming his place.\n\nBut thirty years earlier, long before the corporate chaos, Vinton picked up a\nball of clay and saw a world of potential.\n\nAn Animated Architect\n\nIn 1966, 18-year-old Will Vinton threw a few things in a duffel bag and left\nhis childhood home in McMinnville, Oregon for California. The son of a car\ndealer and a bookkeeper, he\u2019d temporarily leave his humble roots behind to\nattend The University of California at Berkeley.\n\nIt was a wild time to be at Cal: the Free Speech Movement was undulating,\nVietnam protesters occupied the corners of the city, and the Black Panthers\nhad just emerged in neighboring Oakland; the campus was pulsating with energy\n\u2014 Vinton, a doe-eyed freshman, was in its thralls.\n\nInspired, Vinton had his father ship out the family\u2019s 16-millimeter camera,\nand soon began documenting the local scene. His earliest films \u2014 Gone for a\nBetter Deal and The First Ten Days \u2014 captured the rapture of Berkeley\u2019s\ncounter-culture.\n\nAt the same time, Vinton became infatuated with the organic, free-flowing work\nof Spanish architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, and began pursuing a degree in\narchitecture. \u201cYou really couldn\u2019t emulate his buildings with T-squares and\nstraight edges,\u201d he tells us. \u201cSo I started to work with clay as a medium for\ncreating structures.\u201d\n\nBefore long the table in his apartment became a creative hub for clay\nexperimentation:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019d get together a bunch of my architecture buddies and artist friends, and\n> we\u2019d sit at this table just covered in clay \u2014 there was clay everywhere \u2014\n> building stuff, and filming it. Guys would stop by the place and say, \u2018Oh,\n> this is cool! You should do something with this!\u2019 I started thinking a\n> little more seriously about where to take it.\u201d\n\nAt the time, one of Vinton\u2019s housemates was Bob Gardiner, a sculptor and\nstudent at California College of Arts and Crafts. Marrying Vinton\u2019s editing\nskills and Gardiner\u2019s sculpting prowess, the two created Culture Shock, which\ntoyed with the use of clay as a viable animation medium. The film earned them\nfirst prize at the prestigious Berkeley Film Festival.\n\nTwo Dudes, a Basement, and an Oscar\n\nAfter college, the pair parted ways for a while, and clay hit the back-burner.\nGardiner, still a student, preferred to party; Vinton moved to Portland,\nOregon, got married, and \u201csettled down.\u201d For a few years, Vinton honed his\nfilmmaking skills, working as a freelance director, cinematographer, and sound\ntechnician on short films and documentaries. By 1973, with a full arsenal of\nproduction skills under his belt, he began reconsidering the potential of\nclay.\n\nVinton called Gardiner, who had just completed his degree in California, and\ntalked him into moving to Portland to take part in a clay animation\nexperiment. What ensued, says Vinton, was a sequence of events neither of them\ncould\u2019ve ever imagined.\n\n> \u201cWe started out just experimenting in the basement of my house. I was\n> working full-time with freelance projects, and Bob would just be down there\n> all day. We\u2019d work on this concept on weekend, evenings \u2014 it kind of took\n> over our lives.\u201d\n\nFor a year and half, Gardiner lived in Vinton\u2019s basement (eventually, Vinton\u2019s\nwife kicked him out), relentlessly molding clay into odd characters that\nlooked like something out of a bad acid trip. The result was Closed Mondays.\n\nWhile clay animation had been around long before Closed Mondays (as early as\n1908\u2019s The Sculptor\u2019s Welsh Rarebit Dream), it had been replaced by cel (hand-\ndrawn) animation by the 1920s, and was castigated as impractical and time-\nconsuming. Though clay continued to be sparsely used in subsequent animations\n(Gumby, in the 1950s/60s), Vinton revitalized \u2014 then proceeded to\nrevolutionize \u2014 its applications in film.\n\nClosed Mondays was incredibly laborious. As a stop-motion film, one frame shot\nwas required for each tiny movement; in total, the eight-minute film used\n11,520 single shots (doubling included), each of which required a slight re-\nsculpting of the clay. The man\u2019s face \u2014 a life-size bust \u2014 was made from a\nplastic skull covered in plasticine; Vinton would gradually shift the contours\nof the face to alter expressions frame by frame.\n\nAt times, the character\u2019s emotions verged on \u201cthe grotesque,\u201d but the duo\naccepted their mistakes, errors, and mishaps as part of the process that made\ntheir film truly unique. For instance, after weeks of testing shots, they were\nhaving \u201ca hell of a time\u201d getting their clay character to walk without\nwobbling. To work around this, they made him inebriated. Vinton harps on the\nprocess:\n\n> \u201cThere were so many challenges with early claymation, production-wise. We\n> were doing things that had never been done \u2014 POV shots, new rack focusing\n> techniques \u2014 so we had to find our own solutions. The whole point was to\n> challenge ourselves and try different things. If things went wrong, we\u2019d\n> flip them into positives.\u201d\n\nWith high hopes, Vinton submitted his film to a local festival in Portland. It\nhad taken him and Gardiner 14 months, hundreds of hours of editing, and\nthousands of hours sculpting \u2014 and within two minutes, the film was outright\nrejected. \u201cThe judge didn\u2019t even screen it,\u201d recalls Vinton. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t\nhis cup of tea, or whatever.\u201d\n\n> A Bolex Rex-5, the camera Vinton used to shoot Closed Mondays\n\nThe pair was crushed. On a whim, the deflated Vinton showed it to a friend who\nowned a small theatre in the city, and it was screened, as a favor, before a\nfull-length film. The response was incredible.\n\nWith support, the film was submitted to film festivals \u2014 first small ones,\nthen, \u201cas a joke,\u201d bigger ones. But the film rallied, taking the top prize at\nnearly one hundred showings internationally, including Cannes (the \u201ccreme de\nla creme\u201d of festivals).\n\nThen, as quickly as it was once rejected, the film went on to be nominated for\nan Academy Award for Best Animated Short...and it won. Not only was it the\nfirst stop-motion film to ever win in that category, but it claimed Portland\u2019s\nfirst ever Oscar. Suddenly, 26-year-old Vinton was catapulted into the\nnational spotlight. The award came with no monetary payoff, but offered him\nsomething much more valuable: credibility.\n\n> \u201cAfter being completely rejected at a local level, we were validated. It\u2019s\n> exactly what I had set out to do \u2014 prove that clay animation was still\n> viable. Back then, 99% of animation for for children and families, or two-\n> dimensional; this was neither \u2014 it was for adults, it wasn\u2019t a kiddie film.\n> So many people told us it wasn\u2019t going to happen, just forget it. We\n> validated the medium, and it opened doors.\u201d\n\nAnd open doors, it did. Vinton was barraged with requests from advertising\nfirms and film agencies to produce commercials and shorts. In the aftermath of\ntheir first film\u2019s success, Vinton and Gardiner decided to go their separate\nways (\u201cBob was incredibly talented, but his work ethic was non-existent,\u201d says\nVinton); with clients knocking on his door, Vinton embarked, alone, on his\nnext journey.\n\nThe Rise of Vinton Studios\n\nBy 1974, Will Vinton\u2019s clay animation had became both widespread and\nenormously popular, and he was the hottest commodity on the market for big\nbrands looking to distinguish themselves.\n\nHis first project \u2014 a commercial for Rainier Beer \u2014 tasked him with creating a\n\u201cfull mountain scape complete with a bunch of animals singing the praises of\nbeer.\u201d Quickly, Vinton learned that commercial work was a viable way to make\ndecent money: they were short, fun, and allowed him to do what he wanted to\ndo.\n\nWhat he wanted to do was create films, and he wasted no time. The Rainer\ncommercial inspired his next project, 1976\u2019s Mountain Music:\n\nThe film won first prize at the Hemisfilm International Film Festival, and\nprompted Vinton to expand his production team. He brought in six employees \u2014\nmost of whom were old architecture buddies and artists \u2014 and continued\nfocusing on \u201cseeing how far one could push clay animation.\u201d The small team\ndevoted themselves so much to this philosophy that they wouldn\u2019t even\nentertain ideas that \u201cseemed too easy;\u201d the results were unbelievable.\n\nVinton Studios went on to produce three 27-minute fairy tales in rapid\nsuccession \u2014 Martin the Cobbler (1977), Rip Van Winkle (1978), and The Little\nPrince (1979) \u2014 all of which earned the team \u201cbushels of awards.\u201d Vinton,\nunder the guidance of famed animator Barry Bruce, became a master of refining\nhis characters: once jolting and awkward, his clay puppets were now \u201csmooth,\nwith finer contours, and richer detail.\u201d\n\nWhen the team produced a behind-the-scenes feature in 1978 documenting the\nclay animation process, Vinton coined the term \u201cClaymation,\u201d and trademarked\nit. The use of this term differentiated them from the vast, inevitable sea of\nimitators that had begun to surface.\n\nDespite his success, Vinton\u2019s firm earned just $5,000 in its first five years\nof operation \u2014 enough to sustain his work, but not to sustain a team. This\nwould change in the 80s: Vinton Studios became omnipresent and profitable,\nplaying a hand both in film and commercial work.\n\nIn 1985, Vinton secured a contract to produce stop-motion animations for\nDisney\u2019s Return to Oz \u2014 the studio\u2019s first ever outside job \u2014 and it opened\ndoors for them as a \u201chired hand.\u201d Vinton also produced his first full-length\nclaymation film, The Adventures of Mark Twain, which contained probably one of\nthe creepiest scenes in the history of cinema (though Vinton maintains the\nscene is \u201cpulled so far out of context \u2014 that\u2019s why Youtubers are saying, \u201cOh\nthis is horrible!\u201d)\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Vinton had won a trio of Emmy Awards, and had been\nnominated for four Academy Awards. His projects took him everywhere from\nproducing an animation sequence for Michael Jackson\u2019s Moonwalker film to\nclaymating Bruce Willis into a frog.\n\nVinton also continued his work in commercials, creating some of the most\nmemorable spots of the decade. A widely-disseminated ad he made for Alka\nSeltzer starred a \u201cconvention of disgruntled stomachs\u201d waiting for their hero\nto arrive; his \u201cNoid\u201d series for Dominoes Pizza featured a little red-suited\nman with antennas intent on destroying pizzas:\n\nBut perhaps most famous of all, his work for the California Raisin Advisory\nBoard in 1986 featured a troupe of California Raisins singing Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cI\nHeard It Through the Grapevine\u201d \u2014 a rendition that was so popular it landed on\nthe Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe clay raisins became an overnight sensation. They were soon the official\nmascots of Raisin Bran cereal; a whole bevy of collectible figurines was\nreleased, and CBS hired Vinton Studios to produce a musical short, Meet the\nRaisins!, which was aired on prime-time television and garnered nearly 100,000\nper-release orders on VHS. If Vinton hadn\u2019t been on anyone\u2019s radar before\nthese spots, he was now.\n\nCalifornia Raisins\u2019 success brought new wealth to the company: $3 million per\nyear in revenue. Vinton\u2019s team expanded to 50-60 people and he found himself\ngradually phasing out of the animation process and more into a business-\noriented role. Keeping a staff of animators busy every day and overseeing\ntheir work was getting cumbersome, and the visionary began questioning his\ncreative purpose in the company. Despite this, he forged onward.\n\nVinton Goes Digital\n\nIn the wake of the California Raisins craze, commercial advertising came to\ncompromise over 50% of Vinton Studios\u2019 business \u2014 but this was a double-edged\nsword. The raisin commercials had gotten so huge that claymation became\nsynonymous with them; ad agencies that subsequently hired the firm wanted\ndifferent mediums. Vinton had to think bigger.\n\nThrough the 80s, Computer-generated imagery (CGI) technology had been snaking\nits way into film and television. In 1991, the new technology had a banner\nyear with two major box office hits \u2014 James Cameron\u2019s Terminator 2, and\nDisney\u2019s Beauty and the Beast \u2014 both of which made substantial use of CGI.\nIncreasingly, animation houses turned to computers.\n\nVinton decided to go all-in.\n\nOver the next few years, he hired a team of 20 CGI animators, built a computer\ndepartment, and began integrating the technology into his commercial work. It\nwas a difficult time: Vinton had to lay off some of the staff to make room for\nthe CGI division, and he had to balance the creative demands of his remaining\nartists with the technical aspects of the new processes:\n\n> \u201cComputer animation was not art friendly \u2014 anyone with a right half of a\n> brain can do it; CGI requires an animator to be a technician more than an\n> artist. But I found that my old stop-motion animators were best at adapting\n> to it. CGI works in 3d space, and they already had the knowledge of the\n> process in their bag of tricks.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s first task was a commercial for Chips Ahoy! The 30-second spot took\n60 days to produce, but was ground-breaking: instead of abandoning claymation\naltogether, Vinton integrated it with old-school stop-motion techniques and\nCGI to create incredibly unique visuals. The commercial caught the attention\nof M&Ms/Mars, and paved the way for one of Vinton\u2019s most recognizable\ncharacters, the \u201cRed and Yellow\u201d M&Ms; for the next ten years, Vinton Studios\nwould be the M&Ms\u2019 sole animator.\n\nThen, several things happened that changed Vinton Studios forever.\n\nIn an odd twist, Eddie Murphy hired them to animate his prime-time television\nseries. The PJs, which would use both stop motion and CGI technology, gave the\nfirm \u201ca chance to give drab technology a personality.\u201d But since the clay\nprocess took too long for a weekly format, Vinton pioneered yet another\nmedium, \u201cFoamation,\u201d a system in which ball-and-socket armatures were coated\nwith foam latex. The characters were sturdier and lighter than clay, and were\neasier to move.\n\nSoon after, the firm signed on another stop-motion series, Gary and Mike, for\nUPN.\n\nBy the late 90s, Vinton Studios had reached its apogee in revenues, at $28\nmillion. But the success was deceiving: they were entering a new market, faced\nmuch larger projects than they were used to, and funding a rapidly growing\nteam. Pixar\u2019s 1995 smash hit Toy Story only further fueled the studio\u2019s grand\nambition of becoming a major motion picture house. They\u2019d need more money.\n\nCourting Phil Knight\n\nWith the promise of a major television series, and a transition into the\ndigital market, Vinton had to convert his studio into a full-fledged business.\nHis first move was to hire the company\u2019s first professional CEO, Tom Turpin, a\nHollywood executive who\u2019d previously been \u201cRichard Branson\u2019s media hand\u201d at\nVirgin Entertainment.\n\nThe PJs, along with Gary and Mike, put tremendous stress on the studio to\ngrow; in a few months, the team quadrupled from 100 people to over 400. To\nfund this expansion, Turpin was tasked with bringing in outside investors,\nwith a target of $5 million.\n\nCoincidentally, Vinton Studios\u2019 legal counsel, Brian Booth, was also Nike\u2019s;\nwhen he heard Turpin was looking for \u201ca big fish,\u201d he suggested multi-\nbillionaire Nike co-founder Phil Knight. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many things he\u2019s\ncomfortable investing in,\u201d the lawyer told Turpin, \u201cbut I think he\u2019d really\nlike this.\u201d\n\nBooth was right: while touring Vinton Studios, Knight turned to Turpin,\nsmiled, and said, \u201cThis reminds me of when Nike was small.\u201d Initially, the\ntitan agreed to pitch in $2-3 million; when another investor bowed out on the\nremaining $2 million investment, Turpin found himself asking Knight a for\nmore.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on death\u2019s door, Phil,\u201d he told the Nike chairman. \u201cWill you save us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked it for $3 million,\u201d responded Knight. \u201cAnd I like it for $5 million.\u201d\nWith that, Knight fronted the full funding round, and assumed a 15% stake in\nthe company. An additional $2 million was chipped in by venture capitalists,\nand Vinton Studios suddenly had $7 million in the bank.\n\n\u201cChilly Tee:\u201d From Intern to Board Member in Three Years\n\nAs Vinton Studios was transitioning into computer animation in the early 90s,\na young rapper named \u201cChilly Tee\u201d struggled to cut it in the inhospitable\nstreets of Portland.\n\n\u201cPeople think I\u2019m tryna front, tryna fake, tryna be black \u2014 but I \u2018aint,\u201d the\nlyricist told The Word in 1994. \u201cI\u2019m a black sheep in the industry, if you\nwill. Listen to my track \u2018Krisis of Identity \u2014 you\u2019ll get it.\u2019\u201d Chilly\u2019s\n\u201ckrisis\u201d was clear: he was trying his darndest to get street cred, but had to\n\u201ccope\u201d with his roots as .001-percenter.\n\nYou see, Chilly Tee was really Travis Knight, the son of Nike\u2019s billionaire\nco-founder (and Will Vinton\u2019s newest investor).\n\nWhen Chilly showed an interest in dropping beats, his father built him a\nstate-of-the-art recording studio in a backroom of his mansion. When Chilly\nfound himself without a \u201cposse,\u201d his father hired The Bomb Squad \u2014 one of the\nbest rap production crews in the industry \u2014 to flank his homeboy. And finally,\nwhen Chilly failed to generate an inkling of interest from record companies,\nhis father courted a deal with MCA, using his connections in the entertainment\nindustry.\n\nThe rapper moved to New York, holed up in his parents\u2019 Manhattan penthouse for\nsix months and, in 1993, cut his one (and only) album, Get Off Mine, a\nglorious ode to \u201cjust doing my thing.\u201d Hank Shocklee, the Bomb Squad member\nwho produced the album, later expressed his faith in the project to Vibe\nMagazine:\n\n> \u201cAnybody can sit there with somebody who has talent. Here\u2019s a situation\n> where you have to create the whole ball of wax. If you can get this kid\n> across, you can get anybody across.\u201d\n\nHis father\u2019s return on investment came in the form of product placement. \u201cJust\nDo It,\u201d a track from the album, unabashedly paid homage to Nike: \u201cJust do it,\nyou gotta just do it.\u201c But even Phil Knight couldn\u2019t save his son\u2019s rapping\ncareer, and the album was a major flop. In the end, the only award Chilly won\nwas a spot on Complex\u2019s 120 Worst Rapper Names of All Time list.\n\nSlowly, Chilly transitioned into \u201creal life\u201d while continuing to pursue his\ndream. In 1998, at age 25, he graduated from Portland State University with no\njob experience and few prospects.\n\nWhen Phil Knight came on as an investor in 1998, he had a request. Tom Turpin,\nVinton\u2019s CEO, recalls:\n\n> \u201cPhil approached us and said, \u2018Hey, my son\u2019s trying to be a rapper. I don\u2019t\n> know if you have any spots, but would you be willing to give him a shot?\u2019 Of\n> course, we welcomed Travis; he was a low key, unassuming guy \u2014 and how can\n> you say no to Phil Knight?\u201d\n\nWith no knowledge of animation, Travis Knight was assigned \u201cmop duty\u201d \u2014 he\nstarted out in the doldrums of the CGI department, rendering whiskers on The\nPJs\u2019 Thurgood Stubbs. Nobody at Vinton Studios knew he was the heir to a man\nworth $9 billion ($16.3 billion today) \u2014 a man who\u2019d just purchased 15% of the\ncompany.\n\nAnd nobody knew that in three years\u2019 time, the kid would be sitting on the\nstudio\u2019s board of directors \u2014 or that, in less than a decade, he\u2019d be its\npresident and CEO.\n\nIn January 1999, riding on a massive effort by Vinton Studios, The PJs debuted\non Fox. Each of the 43 episodes Vinton Studios produced had taken over two\nmonths, and the top-heavy show ultimately cost more than its ratings\njustified. Just three seasons later, in 2001, the show was discontinued.\n\nThe same year, the company took another blow: Gary and Mike, the show the\nstudio had secured with UPN, was also cancelled, after only one season.\nDespite winning a combined three Emmy Awards, Vinton\u2019s two hopes for the\nfuture had both been cut short. As if that weren\u2019t enough, the studio\u2019s\ncommercial division took huge hit when the September 11th terrorist attacks\nled to an industry-wide downturn in advertising.\n\nSome questionable choices by management (like opening a full-floor penthouse\nstudio in Los Angeles, pouring money into it, leaving it unoccupied, and\nwatching it fold only six months later) put extra strain on the company, and\nit entered a period of intense financial duress. Vinton recalls feeling lost\nin all of this:\n\n> \u201cIt was getting out of my control. There were LA-type agents and executives\n> brought it, contracts that were really deep \u2014 money was spent on things that\n> weren\u2019t adding any real value. For the first time in twenty-five years, our\n> studio was losing money. I started looking for a way out; I wasn\u2019t happy\n> anymore.\u201d\n\nTurpin was dismissed and Jeff Farnath, previously an executive at Disney,\nstepped in to assume his post as CEO. \u201cHe was a great guy,\u201d says Vinton, \u201cbut\ndidn\u2019t really understand the business. He had culture shock.\u201d As disney\nexecutive, Farnath was used to security and big budgets \u2014 a far cry from the\nailing Vinton Studios.\n\nAs investors, board members, and businessmen took over operations, company\nculture suffered. \u201cMax\u201d [name changed], who had joined Vinton Studios as an\nanimator in the late 1980s, left on a sabbatical in late 2000; when he\nreturned seven months later, he saw a completely different company:\n\n> \u201cWhen I left, we had this very close team. There was a lot of trust, we\n> shared secrets, everybody got a chance to do many different things \u2014 it was\n> like an art colony, with free exchange of ideas, and no competition. When I\n> came back, the change was remarkable: the atmosphere was stern, corporate \u2014\n> it was an entirely different company with an entirely different attitude.\u201d\n\nMassive layoffs ensued: the team Vinton had ramped up for the series was cut\nback down from 400 to less than 100. Max, who\u2019d been there for fourteen years,\nwas offered a severance package; others weren\u2019t so lucky. \u201cPeople were offered\nfunny deals, and given much less than they were supposed to get,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cThere were last-minute changes in contracts and severance package rules.\nPeople weren\u2019t treated well.\u201d\n\nIn the course of two years, a severely mismanaged Vinton Studios blew through\nmore than $7 million in funding, largely due to their unwillingness to scale\nback the team even more. There was only one hope to salvage the company, and\nit came with a swoosh.\n\nFarnath, Vinton Studios\u2019 new CEO, approached Phil Knight \u201cwith his tail\nbetween his legs,\u201d and asked the businessman to put in more money \u2014 just a few\nyears after Knight had put up $5 million. This time, Knight had leverage to be\na controlling shareholder.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m gonna put my money into a hemorrhaging company, I\u2019m gonna own it,\u201d\nKnight told Farnath. With a second investment, he swiftly assumed control of\nthe board, and appointed Nike veterans to join him. Ownership secured, his\nnext plan of action was to give his son a seat at the table.\n\nIn late 2003, Travis Knight was promoted to the board of directors. With only\na few years of production experience under his belt, \u201cChilly Tee\u201d was now Will\nVinton\u2019s boss. In his time as an animator, Knight had actually become\nastonishingly good \u2014 one of the best in the business \u2014 but by all accounts, he\ndidn\u2019t qualify to operate a company. Just six months later, citing \u201cmounting\npressure\u201d from Phil Knight, Will Vinton stepped down from the board and was\nfired from his office position.\n\nTwo years earlier, Vinton\u2019s stock had been worth $20 million; now, he sat\nalone in a cold board room, with a $125,000 severance package in front of him.\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d recalls Vinton. \u201cDevastated.\u201d\n\nHe took Phil Knight to court, suing him on the grounds he\u2019d been unfairly\nousted. The whole thing had been part of a grand scheme, he claimed, for\nKnight to give his kid a company. His charge of corporate nepotism wasn\u2019t\nunsubstantiated \u2014 Knight had no reservations in admitting he\u2019d acquired the\ncompany with his son in mind. But the case was dismissed, and the Knights\nproceeded to strip and reconstruct Vinton Studios into an entirely different\ncompany.\n\nIn the severance process, Knight also took ownership of Vinton\u2019s life-long\nbody of work: the M&Ms, the California Raisins \u2014 even the legal trademark\nrights to the term \u201cClaymation.\u201d\n\nWill Vinton, once the king of clay, had been dethroned.\n\nLaika: Chilly Goes to Hollywood\n\nIn the years following Vinton\u2019s departure, Phil Knight poured $180 million of\nhis own money into the shell of Vinton Studios and rebranded the firm as\nLaika. With his son by his side, he set his sights on big-budget, major motion\npictures.\n\nUsing his clout, Knight lured in animation veterans from Disney, DreamWorks,\nand Pixar. He cleared house and brought in a troupe of Nike executives with no\ndiscernable experience in film (one hire even told Fast Company that he\n\u201cwouldn\u2019t know Finding Nemo if it hit [him] in the face\u201d). Henry Selick (a\nstoried producer who\u2019d directed The Nightmare Before Christmas) was hired\nafter Travis had cited him as an animation hero.\n\nKnight commissioned a sprawling $55 million campus to be built by the same\narchitect he\u2019d used for the Nike headquarters, complete with a 300-seat movie\ntheatre and state-of -the-art workout facility. His investments in the\nstudio\u2019s projects were equally grand: the company\u2019s first feature-length film,\nCoraline, enlisted $50 million of the investor\u2019s money.\n\nIn 2009, Coraline debuted. The film was a hit: with a total budget of $60\nmillion, it grossed $124.6, and was nominated for an Academy Award. The team\nfollowed this success with ParaNorman in 2012, which grossed $107.2 million on\nthe same budget. Boxtrolls, their next featured film, is due this September\nand looks to break nine-figures.\n\nBut the studio\u2019s journey hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing: in 2008, they ran into\nthe same problem Vinton Studios had: a planned animated featured fell through,\nand they had to cut \u201ca significant portion\u201d of their staff. In 2009, following\nCoraline\u2019s success, the company severely downsized again to focus solely on\nstop-motion.\n\n\u201cMax,\u201d an animator who\u2019d been laid off from Vinton Studios, later became a\nfreelancer and found himself back at Laika to work on Coraline. \u201cIt was a\nwonderful project to be involved in,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve had better\nexperiences.\u201d He\u2019d been excited to work with Selick, one of his heroes, but\nfound that animators were treated poorly by management. \u201cThere was a \u2018Just Do\nIt\u2019 attitude. It was a beautiful experience, but rough for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nPromoted to CEO and President of Laika in 2009, Travis Knight is at the\ncompany\u2019s helm today. When film critic Bill Desowitz asked new new chief how\nhe felt shortly after his appointment, he responded with a new breed of\nconfidence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting transition, as I\u2019ve gone over the different permutations\nand roles in the studio over the years,\u201d Knight told him. \u201cSo who better than\nme?\u201d\n\nFree Will\n\nWith the manicured mustache of Mark Twain and the chrome dome of an M&M, the\n66-year-old Will Vinton looks almost like an aged, real-life rendering of his\nown creations.\n\nToday, life isn\u2019t as grand for him as it once was \u2014 though it\u2019s simpler,\nquieter, and more hands-on. He\u2019s stepped away from the \u201ccesspool\u201d of business\nand gotten back to what matters most to him: the beauty of animation.\n\nAfter being ousted in 2002, Vinton endured a period of financial and\npsychological anguish. The modest fortune he built for his family over 30\nyears had largely been wrapped up in company stock; when the ship went down,\nhe sank with it. He sold his Oak Grove home of eight years, pulled his two\nsons out of private school, and \u201cscaled back\u201d on the lifestyle he\u2019d grown\naccustomed to.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely a time when I was rolling the dice and growing the\ncompany,\u201d Vinton told the Portland Tribune in 2005. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the\ndownside would be as big as it was.\u201d Months after the interview, Vinton was\nknocked down again: Bob Gardiner, with whom Vinton had sparked his career and\nwon an Academy Award, committed suicide.\n\nVinton has tried to put the past behind him. Now, he\u2019s back where he began:\ngetting his hands dirty and dreaming up the impossible.\n\nNow wary of investors, Vinton has since turned to Kickstarter to fund his most\nrecent endeavor \u2014 \u201cThe Kiss,\u201d a Broadway musical about a lowly frog who dreamt\nbig \u2014 but raised just 20% of his $80,000 target. He also teaches animation\nclasses at the Portland Institute of Art, and operates Freewill, a \u201cboutique\nanimated movie and licensing studio.\u201d Several projects are in the works, he\ntells us, including Santa: An Animated Holiday Treat, which tells a tale\neerily similar to his own: \u201cSanta must battle his megalomaniacal nemesis Old\nMan Winter to reassert the worth of his old-fashioned ideals in the face of a\nmodern world.\u201d\n\nBut modernity hasn\u2019t deterred Vinton from dabbling in his old medium: he still\nholds clay in high esteem.\n\nVinton tells me about a recent trip he took to Seoul, Korea, to visit a small\nproduction studio. In a corner of the office, a small team of animators\ngathered, played Closed Mondays frame by frame, and studied Vinton\u2019s work with\ncrime-scene scrutiny. He spent several hours in the firm\u2019s office, watching\nhis characters flirt across the screen, each a vignette, a moment in time. A\nmodern-day Prometheus, Vinton had made clay human. He had brought it to life,\nmade it dance, and cry, and sing.\n\nAnd like the clay, he was constantly altered. Like the clay, he shrunk under\nfire, but came out more colorful than before. Twisted, pulled, and reshaped,\nhe emerged with an animated smile, as if finally realizing what it is he\naccomplished.\n\nWill Vinton made characters out of clay, and clay made a character out of him.\n\nThis post was written by Zachary Crockett.
