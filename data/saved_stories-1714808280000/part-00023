Big companies looked more widely, but still often favored a limited\nnumber of highly ranked universities. Regional firms would tap graduates of\nschools with the best reputations in their geographic area.\n\n\u201cThere was a notion that the reputation of the school was a proxy for the type\nof talent you might get,\u201d observes Christine Cruzvergara, who served until\nearly 2019 as associate provost and executive director of career education at\nWellesley College in Massachusetts, one of the \u201cSeven Sisters\u201d\u2014elite schools\nfor women established when most of the Ivy League excluded them.\n\nBut both Cruzvergara and employers have moved into a new phase. She\u2019s now\nchief education strategy officer at Handshake, the online job board (founded\nby a member of the Forbes 30 Under 30 class of 2017) that today links 15\nmillion college students and recent graduates with 900,000 employers.\n\nAs for employers, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic; platforms like Handshake\nand Zoom; labor shortages; and a recognition that a diverse workforce is good\nfor business, they\u2019re looking at a broader swath of graduates and even\napplicants with needed skills, but no college degrees. By Handshake\u2019s count,\n72% of the nation\u2019s 500 biggest companies each now hire from 200 colleges or\nmore.\n\nThe widening of the recruiting base has come at the same time as some\nemployers have been souring on graduates of the eight uber-elite Ivy League\nuniversities\u2014Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, Penn, Columbia, Dartmouth and\nCornell.\n\nWhen Forbes surveyed readers of our Future of Work newsletter earlier this\nmonth, 37% of those with hiring authority said state universities were doing\nbetter than five years ago in preparing job candidates and 31% thought non-Ivy\nLeague private colleges had improved. But just 14% thought the Ivy League\nschools were doing better than five years ago, while 20% said they were doing\nworse, making this the only segment in which negative appraisals of the trend\nin job readiness exceeded positive ones.\n\nThe result? Of those hiring folks, 33% said they are less likely to hire Ivy\nLeague graduates than they were five years ago, with only 7% saying they are\nmore likely to hire them. By contrast, 42% said they are more likely to hire\npublic university grads and 37% said they are more likely to hire grads of\nnon-Ivy League private colleges than five years ago. Only about 5% said they\nare less likely to hire from either group.\n\nForbes used answers to that survey, along with such federal education data as\nmedian SAT and ACT scores, to come up with a list of 20 \u201cNew Ivies\u201d\u201410 public,\n10 private\u2014that are now producing the hard-working, high-achievers that\nemployers crave.\n\nReputations do still matter, but they aren\u2019t set in stone. \u201cWhen hiring\nmanagers see an elite brand, that suggests something to them about a level of\nacademic excellence, rigorous selectivity and the like. Are those necessarily\ngood indicators of how well somebody is going to perform on the job? Not\nreally, but hiring managers don\u2019t have much else to go on in a lot of cases\nand particularly for people who don\u2019t have a lot of work experience,\u2019\u2019 says\nMatt Sigelman, president of The Burning Glass Institute, a Philadelphia think\ntank on the future of the workforce. \u201cPart of the advantage that some brands\nconvey is a scarcity value,\u2019\u2019 he adds, noting that the supply of Harvard grads\nis limited and all of them are presumed to be academically talented, whereas\nonly the top of the class at a big state college is presumed to be at that\nsame level.\n\n\u201cIt only takes a quick scan across any organization to say \u2018Who are my best\ncolleagues, who do I love working with?\u2019\u201d says Cruzvergara. \u201cI guarantee a\nmajority of us would list individuals that didn\u2019t go to the most prestigious\ninstitutions at all. That narrative doesn\u2019t match our reality.\u201d\n\nDanielle Mulvey, cofounder of the All In Company, in Dana Point, California,\nwhich provides pre-hiring assessments and other tools for employers, is one of\nthose in our survey who said she\u2019s less likely to hire Ivy League grads these\ndays. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an impact of Covid, but there seems to be less\nwork experience from their undergraduate years, and I value people with work\nexperience and not me being their first job out of college,\u2019\u2019 she says.\n\nMoreover, as our survey of readers with hiring authority demonstrates,\nschools\u2019 reputations\u2019 are dynamic\u2014and not as rooted in history and geography\nas they may have been in the past. Before the pandemic, many companies still\nspent their recruiting dollars attending career fairs at colleges near their\nheadquarters or local operations and forming pathways with regional\nuniversities nearby.\n\nJust as it did with other aspects of office work, the pandemic pushed more of\nthat recruiting online as hiring managers ditched in-person interviews for\nZoom calls and on-campus career fairs for virtual job boards. What were\ninitially solutions to keep business moving during the pandemic have become\nvaluable tools for employers to discover talent. And once they started\nrecruiting workers online from even more geographic areas, employers naturally\nbecame familiar with a greater number of schools.\n\nJust one person can forge a path between a college and a company, Handshake\u2019s\nCruzvergara observes. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve hired somebody and that graduate does\nwell, now [that school] is fair game. They\u2019ll say \u2018We\u2019re willing to go back to\nthat school.\u201d Think of it this way: the best-known elite colleges have always\nhad powerful and far-flung alumni networks. But graduates of lesser-known\nschools are now building more dispersed networks, too, burnishing their\nreputations and raising the job prospects of alumni.\n\nIn addition, many colleges have become increasingly proactive about building\nties with companies and a \u201cproduct\u201d that\u2019s in demand. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of\nschools, and Georgia Tech is one of them, that have been really aggressive at\nmaking sure that they\u2019re not only attracting great researchers, but they\u2019re\nalso building into their academic programs the kinds of experiences that make\nsure that students graduate with work ready skills and with future ready\nskills,\u2019\u2019 Sigelman says. Not coincidentally, Georgia Tech is on Forbes\u2019 New\nIvies list.\n\nThe desire for a more diverse workforce\u2014as well as talent shortages\u2014are\nadditional reasons employers are casting a wider net. PwC, the second largest\nU.S.-based accounting firm, with 364,000 employees and $53 billion in revenue\nworldwide in 2023, is now using both on-campus and virtual events, as well as\njob boards, to attract 200,000 entry applicants a year, reports Rod Adams, the\nfirm\u2019s talent acquisition and onboarding leader. The result: it\u2019s now hiring\ncandidates from about 700 universities and colleges a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continually focused on expanding our net to reach people from a vast\nrange of experiences and diverse backgrounds,\u2019\u2019 Adams says. For example, PwC\nnow recruits from 36 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, up five-\nfold from 2017. It\u2019s also pouring money into collaborations with HBCUs and\nHispanic Serving Institutions.\n\nThis is about more than diversity. There\u2019s a shortage of qualified CPAs. So\nPwC has set up a program that pays students to work part-time, while they earn\na tuition-free masters at Northeastern University in Boston. It has even\nstarted investing resources in community colleges in a bid to help those\nstudents \u201caccess career paths they might not have originally considered,\u2019\u2019\nAdams notes.\n\nOther big players are also reaching out to community colleges. Bank of\nAmerica, the nation\u2019s second largest bank, reports it has partnered with 30\ncommunity colleges to develop a curriculum in financial services. With\ninternships an increasingly important pathway to jobs, its Global Technology\nTeam began offering summer internships specifically for community college\nstudents as a pilot program in 2022. Satisfied with the results, it continued\nthe internships for 2023 and now 2024.\n\nEven those who recruit from a more limited number of schools are looking at a\nmore diverse mix\u2014and using technology to widen the geographic pool. Booz Allen\nHamilton, a military and government contractor based in McLean, Virginia,\nrecruits from a core group of 20 colleges, based in large part on the location\nof its offices, says Tom Downs, director of diversity talent acquisition and\ntalent pipeline programs. The core includes the University of Virginia and the\nUniversity of Maryland, both members of the New Ivies, as well as Howard\nUniversity in Washington, D.C. and Morgan State University in Baltimore, both\nHBCUs.\n\nPost-pandemic, Booz Allen is back to doing more in-person recruiting\nevents\u2014some 75 last year. But Covid-19 permanently expanded the way it looks\nfor talent. It found about 10% of its college interns this year on Handshake.\n\u201cNow we can reach out and touch you via (Microsoft) Teams and Zoom or\nwhatever,\u2019\u2019 Downs says. \u201cFor the future, we\u2019ll always see a hybrid opportunity\nto engage.\u201d\n\n#### MORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesExclusive: Employers Are Souring On Ivy League Grads, While These 20\n\"New Ivies\" AscendBy Emma WhitfordForbesThis Billionaire's Bad Bets Left\nHundreds Of Underserved Scholarship Students In LimboBy Giacomo\nTogniniForbesStrapped College Town Wants To Impose A $50 Per-Student, Per-\nSemester TaxBy Kelly Phillips ErbForbesA College Double Major Could Be A\nTicket To Career SecurityBy Emma WhitfordForbesWill Homeschooling Parents Save\nEdtech?By Emma Whitford\n\nEmma Whitford\n\nI write about business, finance and technology in the K-12 and higher\neducation sectors.
