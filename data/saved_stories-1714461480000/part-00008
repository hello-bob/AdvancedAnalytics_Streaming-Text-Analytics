In his\nbook No Sense of Place (1985), Meyrowitz first applied the concept to media\nlike television and the radio. He claimed that this new kind of technology\nbroke barriers between different kinds of audiences as the content being\nproduced was broadcast widely.^[4] In The Presentation of Self in Everyday\nLife, Erving Goffman argues that individuals develop \"audience segregation\"\nwhereby they make sure that they segregate one audience to whom they perform\none role from the other audiences to whom they play a different role. Context\ncollapse arises out of the failure to do so. This is partly because of the\ninclination to imply during an interaction that one's performance is their\nmost important role performance (an impression that would collapse if\ndifferent audiences to whom one performs differently were to be integrated)\nand that there is a uniqueness to one's relationship and role performance to a\ngiven audience.^[5]\n\nMichael Wesch used the term context collapse in his 2008 lecture \"An\nAnthropological Introduction to YouTube.\"^[6] The term was first used in print\nby danah boyd, Alice Marwick, and Wesch. boyd is credited with coining the\nterm \"collapsed contexts\" in the early 2000s in reference to social media\nsites like Myspace and Friendster.^[7]^[4]^[8]\n\n## In social media[edit]\n\nThe concept of context collapse has become much more prominent with the rise\nof social media because many of these platforms, like Twitter, restrict users\nfrom specifically identifying and determining their audience.^[2] On Twitter,\ncontext collapse is seen with the retweeting functionality. When a public user\nposts a social media post known as a 'tweet', it can be retweeted by anyone,\nthus introducing the content to a new audience.^[4] To avoid any unwanted\nattention, some users may resort to the 'lowest common denominator' approach.\nThis is when a user may only post content online they know would be\nappropriate for all of their audience members.^[9]\n\n## Types of context collapse[edit]\n\nAs defined by linguist Jenny L. Davis and sociologist Nathan Jurgenson, there\nare two main types of context collapse: context collusions and context\ncollisions. Context collusions are considered to be intentional while context\ncollisions are considered to be unintentional.\n\nAn example of context collusion offline may be a wedding where different\nsocial circles are purposefully combined. Online, context collusion is seen on\nsocial media sites like Facebook where one may create a post to garner\nattention from various social groups.\n\nContext collision is seen in the case where someone makes a joke about someone\nelse, not realizing they are also listening. On the web, an example of context\ncollision is when companies accidentally make private information about their\nusers available.^[2]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Poe's law\n  * Contextual Integrity\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Brandtzaeg, Petter Bae; L\u00fcders, Marika (2018). \"Time Collapse in Social Media: Extending the Context Collapse\".
