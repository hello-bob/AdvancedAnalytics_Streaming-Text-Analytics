The idea\nmight seem preposterous - pitting a 40-year-old home computer against a device\npowered by 127-Qubit \u2018Eagle\u2019 quantum processing unit (QPU). However, the\nanonymous researcher(s) conclude that the \u2018Qommodore 64\u2019 performed faster, and\nmore efficiently, than IBM\u2019s pride-and-joy, while being \u201cdecently accurate on\nthis problem.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the paper, the researchers admit that their \u2018Qommodore 64\u2019\nproject is \u201ca joke,\u201d but, sadly for IBM, its proof of quantum utility was also\nbuilt upon shaky foundations, and the Qommodore 64 team came up with some\nconvincing-looking benchmarks. There was some controversy about IBM\u2019s claims\nat the time, and we are reminded it took just five days for the quantum\nexperiment to be simulated on an ordinary MacBook M1 Pro laptop. The jokey\nQuantum Disadvantage paper (PDF link, headlining section starts at page 199)\nports this experiment to a machine packing the far more humble MOS Technology\n6510 processor.\n\nImage 1 of 3\n\n(Image credit: SIGBOVIK 2024)\n\n(Image credit: SIGBOVIK 2024)\n\n(Image credit: SIGBOVIK 2024)\n\nTo get deep into the weeds with the quantum theory and math behind the quantum\nutility experiment, please follow the above PDF link. However, to summarize,\nthe C64-based experiment uses the sparse Pauli dynamics technique developed by\nBegu\u015di\u0107, Hejazi, and Chan to approximate the behavior of ferromagnetic\nmaterials. Famously, IBM claimed such calculations were \u201ctoo difficult to\nperform on a classical computer to an acceptable accuracy, using the leading\napproximation techniques,\u201d recalls the paper. Not quite, and as already\nmentioned above, an ordinary laptop can obtain similar results.\n\nThe anonymous C64 user(s) provide some interesting details of their quantum-\ndefeating feat. Their aggressively truncated and shallow depth-first search\nmodel used just 15kB of the spacious 64kB available on the iconic Commodore\nmachine. Meanwhile, the final code consisted of about 2,500 lines of 6502\nassembly, stored on a cartridge that fitted in the C64\u2019s expansion port. This\ncode was handled by the mighty 1 MHz 8-bit MOS 6510 CPU. The C64 took approx 4\nminutes per data point. (Testing the same code on a modern laptop achieved\nroughly 800\u03bcs per data point.)\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nIn conclusion, the researcher(s) asserts that the \u2018Qommodore 64\u2019 is \u201cfaster\nthan the quantum device datapoint-for-datapoint... it is much more energy\nefficient... and it is decently accurate on this problem.\u201d On the topic of how\napplicable this research is to other quantum problems, it is snarkily\nsuggested that \u201cit probably won\u2019t work on almost any other problem (but then\nagain, neither do quantum computers right now).\u201d Overall, it is difficult to\nknow whether the results are entirely genuine, though a lot of detail is\nprovided and the linked research references in the paper seem genuine.\n\nWe know many readers are retro computing enthusiasts, as well as DIYers and\nmakers. So it is good to know that the author(s) of this paper say that they\nwill provide source code to allow others to replicate their results. However,\nsource code will only be supplied in one of three formats, they say: \u201ca copy\nhandwritten on papyrus, a slide-show of blurry screenshots recorded on a VHS\ntape, or that I dictate it to you personally over the phone.\u201d So please add an\nextra pinch of salt to this story for that.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

I learned that one of the death knells for the Amiga was that they\nrefused to adopt MS office. They wanted to develop their own.\n\nAnyway. Fun article.

The top image in the article is a 3D render of the \"Commodore 64x\" which\nis a mITX PC case with mechanical keyboard, merely shaped like a Commodore 64\nbreadbin. The keyboard layout is different, adapted for a PC.\n\n> kyzarvs said:\n>\n> It took a very long time for true multi-tasking to become as efficient as\n> the Amiga chipset\n\nPreemptive multitasking did not depend on the custom chipset: you'd need only\na hardware timer that could trigger an interrupt, and in the Amiga: that was\nin one of the CIA chips. Those were in essence variants of the ones in the\nC64.\n\nIt was otherwise all software: Carl Sassenrath's \"Exec\" handled interrupts,\ntask scheduling and message passing and the framework that allowed dynamically\nloaded libraries and device drivers.\n\nR.J. Mical's \"Intuition\" had the windows, menus and \"gadgets\"\n(\"controls\"/\"widgets\") run in Intuition's task instead of requiring message\nround-trips to the application for every user interaction like on other\nsystems: This made using multiple tasks very responsive, independent of how\nslow the applications actually were. That the Blitter was used to move windows\naround and scroll window contents helped of course, but was not critical.\n\n> Blastomonas said:\n>\n> Agreed.

They wanted to develop their own.\n\nYou mean: Microsoft wanted to develop their own windowing system? They were\napparently busy with Windows 1.0 when the Amiga launched, yes. It was not the\nonly or even the first windowing system on top of MS-DOS at the time though,\nso I'd think that Microsoft regarded those as more close competitors.\n\nThe general belief back in the day was that Microsoft would have ported\nMicrosoft Office to the Amiga had the Amiga platform appeared to be viable in\nthe long run, with good sales figures also in the US and a strong company\nbehind it that believed in the platform, but...\n\nAFAIK, there were some pretty viable word processors and spreadsheets for the\nAmiga. Microsoft Office did not become dominant even on the PC until the\nmid-90's when Commodore went bankrupt. I'd think that in about '93, the\ndominant PC word processor was still WordPerfect: both in DOS and MS Windows\n3.1, and the dominant spreadsheet was Lotus-1-2-3. BTW. I believe the DOS\nversion of WordPerfect was even ported to Amiga: but a WYSIWYG version never\nwas.\n\nReply\n\n  * Amdlova\n\nFeeling nostalgic these days... windows 95, commodore computers... just\nbrought the 1999 silver game on steam... man need to get a 4:3 screen to\nfulfill the vibe\n\nReply\n\n  * niceguy1\n\nthe ides of april. i had a vic 20 with 4k of ram (i believe). cartridge side\nscrolling games and basic programming - i also had a 300 baud modem. yeah im\nold.\n\nReply\n\n  * SunMaster\n\n> Blastomonas said:\n>\n> Agreed.

And qc issues.\n\nBut the Amiga was an amazing design, I loved both my A1000 and A2000.\n\nReply\n\n  * 35below0\n\nWindows still hasn't come round to the idea of hiding files the user doesn't\never want to interact with. Or the idea of non-uniform icon sizes. They did\ntry the idea of applying wallpapers to individual drawers folders... It was\nnot a pretty sight.\n\nReply\n\n  * Sluggotg\n\nThe C64 was my first computer. Then the Amigas came out. I jumped to the\nA2000. Loved Commodore but it was ran into the ground by Irving Gould. He\nowned controlling interest in the company and kicked out Jack Tramiel. It was\nsad to see Commodore go away.\n\nObviously I still have C64s/Amigas and many other models of old computers.\nComputing in the 80s was very exciting. It still is but in a different way.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nAMD unveils Ryzen Pro 8000-series processors \u2014 Zen 4 and AI engines come to\nthe commercial market\n\nRaspberry Pi brings GitHub's Octocat to life, with tentacles that wiggle\n\nAsus' 8K Mini LED ProArt display is the king of new ultra high-end\nprofessional monitors \u2014 1200 nits and 4096 lighting zones\n\nMinisforum V3 tablet arrives \u2014 the world's first AMD Ryzen 7 8840U-powered\nSurface clone\n\nEnthusiast arms 12-slot NVMe NAS with an Nvidia RTX GPU to run local ChatGPT\n\nLamptron gets caught using counterfeit AIDA64 software keys with its LCD-\nequipped products\n\nCommodore 64 claimed to outperform IBM's quantum system \u2014 sarcastic\nresearchers say 1 MHz computer is faster, more efficient, and decently\naccurate\n\nGigabyte officially unveils premium ice-themed motherboard and GPU \u2014 XTREME\nPrestige Limited Edition lineup arrives\n\nSamsung plans big capacity jump for SSDs, preps 290-layer V-NAND this year,\n430-layer for 2025\n\nChatGPT plays Red Dead Redemption II \u2014 AI vision system was overwhelmed\n\nTuxedo's Sirius 16 Gen2 is an All-AMD Linux gaming laptop with a 165 Hz IPS\npanel \u2014 starts at 1699 Euros\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
