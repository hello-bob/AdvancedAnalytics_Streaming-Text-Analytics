Kristopher Shultz of the\nClark County Sheriff's Office said.\n\n\"Mr. Brock received some scam call by a person purporting to be someone from\nour courts who informed him a family member was incarcerated and that he had a\nbond of a significant amount of money,\" Shultz said. \"The calls turned from\n'I'm an officer in the court' to 'We have this subject hostage, this is a\nransom demand.'\"\n\nThe person who called Brock, or an accomplice, requested an Uber ride to his\nSouth Charleston home to pick up the money, Shultz said.\n\n\"Ms. Hall did not have any idea,\" he added.\n\nWilliam Brock told investigators he shot Loletha Hall, 61, outside his home\nMarch 25 because he thought she was working with a man who called him\npretending to be an officer at the local court, according to the Clark County\nSheriff's Office.Clark County Sheriff's Office\n\nWhen Hall arrived at the home and approached the front door, Brock confronted\nher with a gun and asked her who she was working for, Shultz said. He took her\ncellphone and prevented her from getting in her vehicle and driving away.\n\n\u201cWhen she tried to get away, he shot her once, then there was more exchange\nbetween them,\" Shultz said. \"Mr. Brock was at some point injured to his head,\nand he shot Ms. Hall a second time. There was more conversation, and then he\nshot her a third time. Only after he shot her a third time did he then make\ncontact with authorities to report the incident.\"\n\nHall did not threaten Brock, have a weapon or assault him, according to the\nsheriff's office and a complaint filed in Clark County Municipal Court. She\nwas taken to a hospital where she died from her injuries, according to the\ncomplaint.\n\nIn a statement, Uber said the company had spoken with Hall's family.\n\n\"This is a horrific tragedy and our hearts continue to be with Loletha\u2019s loved\nones as they grieve,\" an Uber spokesperson said. \"We have been in contact with\nlaw enforcement and remain committed to supporting their investigation.\"\n\nWilliam Brock's home.Clark County Sheriff's Office\n\nThe Uber spokesperson said the account of the person who ordered a car to\nBrock's house has been banned. Officials have not identified the person who\nrequested the Uber and have not said whether they have made any additional\narrests in connection with the case.\n\nIn a grand jury presentation Monday, Brock was indicted on three counts of\nmurder, one count of felonious assault and one count of kidnapping, Shultz\nsaid. He will be arraigned on those charges later this week.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether he has an attorney.\n\nBrock was originally arraigned on a murder charge in the Municipal Court of\nClark County on Wednesday and posted a $200,000 bond. If convicted of that\ncharge, he could be sentenced to 15 years to life in prison or a $15,000 fine.\n\nMirna Alsharif\n\nBreaking news reporter\n\nAllison Burstein contributed.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
