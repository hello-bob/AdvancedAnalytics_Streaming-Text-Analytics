As far as verified measurements go, the longest living snake right now\nmeasures a paltry 7.67 meters.\n\nA total of 27 different fossils were analyzed. (Datta & Bajpai, Scientific\nReports, 2024)\n\nRecovered from a fossil bed in the Naredi formation in the western Indian\nstate of Gujarat, the remains would have been deposited in what was once a\nbrackish lake or lagoon early in the Eocene, more than 40 million years ago.\n\nBesides its astonishing length, the ancient snake can tell us more about the\nevolution of similar giant serpents. By assessing the size, shape and\ncharacteristics of the fossils, and comparing them to known species, the\nresearchers have placed this snake in the now-extinct Madtsoiidae family.\n\n\"Here we report the discovery of a giant madtsoiid snake, one of the largest\nsnakes ever reported, from an interval corresponding to a warm Middle Eocene\nperiod (~47 million years ago) of India,\" write the researchers in their\npublished paper.\n\nGeographer Debajit Datta and paleontologist Sunil Bajpai analyzed 27 vertebrae\nmeasuring up to 62.7 millimeters (2.5 inches) in length and up to 111.4\nmillimeters (4.39 inches) in width. The fossils, together with previous\nstudies into ancient snakes, point to a broad, cylindrical body.\n\nBased on the characteristics of the snake's backbone, it's unlikely that it\nspent much of its time in the water or the trees. V. indicus was most probably\na slow-moving snake that caught its prey with ambushes, much like the\nanaconda, the researchers say.\n\nFrom what we already know about ancient snakes and the lineages that connect\nthem to today's species, the family that this snake belongs to most probably\nfirst emerged in India before spreading to Europe and Africa some 56-34\nmillion years ago.\n\n\"Biogeographic considerations, seen in conjunction with its interrelationship\nwith other Indian and North African madtsoiids, suggest that Vasuki represents\na relic lineage that originated in India,\" write Datta and Bajpai.\n\nGiven the giant size of V. indicus, there's a strong possibility it lived in a\nrelatively warm (28 \u00b0C or 82 \u00b0F) climate in this part of India, with higher\ntemperatures meaning faster metabolic rates in cold-blooded reptiles.\n\nIt's not just a fascinating snake species discovery then, but also another\ndata point for understanding the climate patterns of the ancient past.\nEverything considered though, we're glad this is a snake that we're never\ngoing to come across.\n\n\"Recovery of additional material and new taxa (including large-sized forms)\nmay provide further insights into madtsoiid systematics and biogeography,\"\nDatta and Bajpai conclude.\n\nThe research has been published in Scientific Reports.\n\nTrending News\n\nYour Vision Can Predict Dementia 12 Years Before Diagnosis, Study Finds\nHealth5 days ago\n\nExpired Cans of Salmon From Decades Ago Reveal a Big Surprise Nature7 days ago\n\nMysterious Link Between Cats And Schizophrenia Is Real, Study Finds Health7\ndays ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
