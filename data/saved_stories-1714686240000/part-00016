CREDIT Ed Bell for\nthe Simons Foundation\n\nA team of astronomers and citizen scientists has discovered a planet in the\nhabitable zone of an unusual star system, including two stars and potentially\nanother exoplanet.\n\nThe planet hunters spotted the Neptune-like planet as it crossed in front of\nits host star, temporarily dimming the star\u2019s light in a way akin to a solar\neclipse on Earth. This \u2018transit method\u2019 usually identifies planets with tight\norbits, as they are more likely to follow paths that put them between Earth\nand their host star and, when following such paths, move into light-blocking\npositions more frequently.\n\nThat\u2019s why this newly discovered planet is considered unusually far out, with\nthe planet taking 272 days to lap its star. Furthermore, the star is now by\nfar the brightest one known to host a transiting planet in the habitable zone\nwhere liquid water can exist.\n\nFollow-up observations of the system revealed even more peculiarities. The\nstar is also orbited by a still unconfirmed second planet with a 34-day orbit\nand, perhaps most interestingly, another star. The unique system provides a\nvaluable data point for scientists trying to understand how planets form and\nremain in stable orbits in multi-star systems. The researchers present their\ndiscoveries April 30 in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nAn infographic illustrating new discoveries about a multi-star, multi-planet\nsystem. CREDIT Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Simons Foundation\n\n\u201cFinding planets in multi-star systems is crucial for our understanding of how\nyou can make different planets out of the same material,\u201d says study lead\nauthor Nora Eisner, a research fellow at the Flatiron Institute\u2019s Center for\nComputational Astrophysics in New York City.\n\nSystems of stars and planets form when clouds of gas and dust begin clumping\ntogether. When a star forms alongside another star, the pair can form a binary\nstar system. Because planets are estimated to be half as likely to form in a\nbinary star system compared to single-star systems, Eisner says \u201cit\u2019s quite\nexciting that we found this one.\u201d\n\nThe newfound planet \u2014 formally called TOI 4633 c, but nicknamed Percival\n(after a character from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d book series) by the scientists \u2014\nwas first identified by citizen scientists sifting through data collected by\nNASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The Planet Hunters TESS\nprogram enables anyone with a computer connected to the internet to search for\nundiscovered planets in the TESS data.\n\n\u201cEvery time I spot a possible transit, I can feel my heart beat faster and my\nexcitement rise extensively,\u201d says Simon Bentzen, a Danish citizen scientist\nwho has volunteered with Planet Hunters TESS since 2018. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that\nI helped find the new system. I hope that the new planets can help contribute\nto our understanding of planet formation and help answer other interesting\nplanetary questions.\u201d\n\nThe citizen scientists help the astronomers sort through the enormous\ndatasets, which are far too large for researchers to analyze on their own. To\ndate, the project has allowed over 43,000 volunteers from 90 countries to help\ncatalog some 25 million objects. Citizen scientists are particularly\ninvaluable in finding long-orbit exoplanets because these objects are hard for\ncomputers to identify.\n\n\u201cThe human brain has a really incredible ability to recognize patterns and to\nfilter out noise,\u201d says Eisner, who is the principal investigator of Planet\nHunters TESS. \u201cWhile our algorithms struggle to identify these longer-period\nplanets, the citizen scientists don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter 15 citizen scientists flagged the possible planet, Eisner and her team\ndecided to take a closer look. Follow-up study of the star\u2019s radial velocity \u2014\nwhich looked for tiny wobbles in the star\u2019s movement that reveal the\ngravitational tug of nearby companions \u2014 showed a potential second planet\nclose to the star.\n\nFurther images and archival data revealed that what the scientists first\nthought was a single star is in fact two. The two co-orbiting stars are\ncurrently too close together to be distinguished individually from our vantage\npoint on Earth. However, archival observations of the star collected over the\npast 119 years showed that the system is indeed a pair of binary stars.\n\nThe three transits of TOI 4633 c. Nominal TESS observations are shown in light\ngray while solid circles represent 60 minutes binned data.\n\nThe new exoplanet has the second-longest orbit of any planet discovered with\nTESS data and is one of only five with orbits longer than 100 days. \u201cThis\nplanet is remarkable in many aspects,\u201d Eisner says. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable in its\norbit, it\u2019s remarkable for being in the habitable zone and it\u2019s remarkable for\norbiting a bright star.\u201d\n\nWhile the scientists do think the planet is in the habitable zone, they would\nnot advise it as a destination for your next interstellar vacation. TOI 4633 c\nhas no solid surface, and the atmosphere is probably thick with water vapor,\nhydrogen and methane. However, previous studies have shown that long-period\nplanets are more likely to have satellites or moons, which may offer solid\nsurfaces for life to take hold.\n\n\u201cIf this planet were to have a moon, that moon would likely have a solid\nsurface, which could then be a great place to find water,\u201d Eisner says. In the\nfuture, the exoplanet could be targeted by exomoon detection campaigns given\nthe system\u2019s brightness and the planet\u2019s long orbit, both of which are helpful\nfor exomoon detection.\n\nWhile scientists are keen to learn more about this system, it will be at least\n30 years before the two stars are far enough apart for them to determine the\nexact layout of the stellar system. Confirming whether the planets orbit the\nsame star or different ones could help improve our understanding of how long\nsuch systems can remain stable. It could also help scientists make better\npredictions for finding new exoplanets. Indeed, nearly half of all sunlike\nstars occupy multi-star systems.\n\n\u201cIf we were able to constrain where the planets orbit, it would really offer a\nstepping stone to open up our understanding of exoplanet formation,\u201d Eisner\nsays. \u201cIt could also possibly help us someday be able to look at a star and\nits properties and make some guesses about what planets are potentially\norbiting in that system.\u201d\n\nEisner encourages people interested in volunteering with Planet Hunters TESS\nto check out the project\u2019s website.\n\nABOUT THE FLATIRON INSTITUTE\n\nThe Flatiron Institute is the research division of the Simons Foundation. The\ninstitute\u2019s mission is to advance scientific research through computational\nmethods, including data analysis, theory, modeling and simulation. The\ninstitute\u2019s Center for Computational Astrophysics creates new computational\nframeworks that allow scientists to analyze big astronomical datasets and to\nunderstand complex, multi-scale physics in a cosmological context.\n\nPlanet Hunters TESS.
