The early days of the web were\nchaotic, free, and open. Everyone published unique content on their own\ndomain. No two sites looked the same. We interacted with one another to share\nideas.\n\nThen the social networks came. They removed the complexity of running a\nserver. They added simple social interactions. Follow. Like. Reply. Everything\ngot easier.\n\nBut convenience came at a cost, and slowly the way we consumed information\nbecame less like home cooking and more like McDonalds.\n\nThis fast food algorithm diet was deliberately designed by technology\ncompanies to profit from our addictions. And after two decades of indulgence,\nthe cracks in our collective consciousness are visible all around us.\n\nThe time has come to take back control, and there are good reasons to be\noptimistic.\n\nFor the past few years the choice has been difficult. Either participate in\nclosed networks at the mercy of algorithms, or set up an independent website\nat the expense of your growth. Now, though, that entire dynamic is getting\nflipped upside down for the first time.\n\nEmail gave us private messaging technology that isn\u2019t owned by a single\ncompany. You can communicate with anyone, whether you use Gmail or Outlook.\n\nActivityPub is doing the same for social technology. It\u2019s a protocol that\nallows people across different platforms to follow, like and reply to one\nanother. No algorithms. No lock-in. No bullshit.\n\nThe open web is coming back, and with it returns diversity. You can both\npublish independently and grow faster than ever before with followers from all\nover the world & the web.\n\nClosed networks are in a heated zero-sum competition for users, so your reach\nis limited to people on the same platform.\n\nEmail, the web\u2019s original open protocol, is used by more people than any\nplatform or social network that has been invented before or since; because it\nshares users rather than competing for them.\n\nThe ActivityPub network works the same way: You get access to an audience of\nevery person across any platform. Open networks grow larger because they don't\ndepend on the success of any one company.\n\n## Platforms by number of users\n\nEmail\n\n4.4b\n\nFacebook\n\n3b\n\nInstagram\n\n2b\n\nTikTok\n\n1b\n\nX\n\n300m\n\n30m (Substack)\n\n> \u201cThe fundamental shift, from platforms to protocols, appears to have\n> momentum in a way it never has before.\u201d\n\nDavid Pierce // The Verge \u2192\n\n## So, what are we going to do with all this momentum?\n\nIn 2024, Ghost is adopting ActivityPub and connecting with other federated\nplatforms across the web.\n\nThis means that, soon, Ghost publishers will be able to follow, like and\ninteract with one another in the same way that you would normally do on a\nsocial network \u2014 but on your own website.\n\nThe difference, of course, is that you\u2019ll also be able to follow, like, and\ninteract with users on Mastodon, Threads, Flipboard, Buttondown, WriteFreely,\nTumblr, WordPress, PeerTube, Pixelfed... or any other platform that has\nadopted ActivityPub, too. You don\u2019t need to limit yourself to following people\nwho happen to use the same platform as you.\n\n## Follow whoever you like, wherever they are.\n\nWe\u2019re building an ActivityPub feed directly into Ghost to allow you to follow\npeople, publications and topics from around the web that interest and inspire\nyou.\n\nYou can already subscribe to Ghost sites using email or RSS, but now you\u2019ll be\nable to subscribe using ActivityPub and have fresh content from all your\nfavorite places delivered to a single, unified place. The same place you\nalready go when you want to publish yourself.\n\nWhen you do publish, your posts will appear in other people\u2019s feeds in\nGhost... and in Mastodon, and everywhere else.\n\n## Enjoy a simple, relaxed reading experience.\n\nLong-form content deserves a dedicated design so you can read in peace, much\nlike the way email newsletters show up in your inbox.\n\nThe great thing about ActivityPub is that each platform can design its own\nexperience around how to present content, whilst still remaining compatible\nwith everything else.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent the past 10 years designing a great writing experience with Ghost.\nNow, for the first time, we\u2019re going to work on designing a great reading\nexperience, too. Which is cool because it turns out that people who write a\nlot also tend to read a lot.\n\nWho\u2019d have thought?\n\n## A universal way for people to subscribe to your work.\n\nActivityPub is a lot like email, and Ghost already supports email\nsubscriptions. This means we can use the same interface to support both. Your\naudience enters whatever address they\u2019re used to subscribing to things with,\nand Ghost figures out the rest.\n\nThis allows your readers to choose how they would prefer to subscribe, and\nyour work to reach farther and wider when you publish.\n\nThe great thing about this is that ActivityPub subscribers and email\nsubscribers are all just registered Ghost members.\n\nRegardless of the way people sign up, they can sign in, comment, like a post,\nor adjust the way they prefer to receive new posts from you. One benefit of\nActivityPub over email is that it has a 100% deliverability rate. No more\nOutlook quarantine folder nonsense.\n\nWhen people reply or interact with your posts in the broader ActivityPub\nnetwork, those interactions will show up on your site, too.\n\nAnd, because this technology is all open, you remain in full control of your\nsubscribers.\n\nWhen you publish a new piece online, your distribution comes from your own\nwebsite rather than needing to depend on 3rd parties.\n\n## So how\u2019s all this going to work?\n\nNetworks tend to work best when they\u2019re shaped by the people who use them. So,\nrather than going away and working on things quietly behind closed doors,\nwe\u2019re inviting you to be a part of the build process, and help answer this\nquestion.\n\nWhat you\u2019re looking at here is our first step: Publishing some initial ideas,\nand inviting your feedback.

ActivityPub is a protocol, like email. You can use it for whatever you\nlike. Mastodon and Threads are built around short-form content, Pixelfed is\nbuilt around images, Peertube is built around video. Ghost is going to be\nflexible, but generally focused on long-form, rich content.\n\n### Are you working together with anyone else on this?\n\nYes! Our friends at Buttondown are also building ActivityPub support right\nnow, and we've received kind offers of help from teams at Mastodon & the\nActivityPub spec authors. If any other platforms want to work together, drop\nus an email on activitypub@ghost.org.\n\nIf Google, Apple, Samsung and Amazon are all able to collaborate on Matter to\nmake their products interoperable with one another, there\u2019s no reason\npublishing platforms can\u2019t do the same.\n\n### What about premium content & paid subscribers?\n\nWe think that should work fine, too. There are multiple ways of supporting\ngated access to content in ActivityPub, and we're going to do our best to\ncreate a seamless experience both for publishers and for readers.\n\n### How big is the ActivityPub network?\n\nBecause it\u2019s decentralised, we don\u2019t have an exact total. Based on data we\nhave about the largest ActivityPub platforms, particularly Meta/Threads, it\u2019ll\nbe between 170-200million users by the summer of 2024. Ghost will be adding\ntens-of-millions more to that total.\n\n### I don't want this and I'm very angry about it!\n\nActivityPub support will be optional and you don't have to turn it on if you\ndon't want it. Sorry you're having a bad day, here's a video of a really good\ndog to cheer you up.\n\n### This sounds great! How do I get it?\n\nSign up below for early access to ActivityPub support in Ghost! We\u2019ll be\nsharing everything we\u2019re working on in a dedicated email newsletter.\n\nIf you\u2019re currently using another platform without ActivityPub support and\nyou\u2019re curious about trying Ghost and enjoying 0% payment fees, we're happy to\nhelp migrate you - free of charge.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013\u20132024 Ghost Decentralised.
