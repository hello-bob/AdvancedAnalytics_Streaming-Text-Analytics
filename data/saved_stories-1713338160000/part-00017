So, let\u2019s look at five\npractices that can help you keep your applications more secure.\n\n## 1\\. Validate inputs and sanitize data\n\nInput validation and data sanitization are fundamental aspects of secure\ncoding. It is important to validate all incoming data against the expected\nformats and sanitize it, as this can greatly reduce the risks posed by SQL\ninjection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Processing un-sanitized data\ncan have some serious implications for the safety and security of both\ninfrastructure and customer data. It can also be used to provide attack\nvectors for exploits, for example, exfiltration of data, request forgeries,\nand injection-based attacks. For robust sanitization and validation, consider\nlibraries like Pydantic, which can help you confirm all data incoming is what\nis expected. Using Pydantic, which adopts a fail-early approach, we can stop\nthe propagation of data before it can become a problem.\n\n## 2\\. Use secure coding libraries and tools\n\nLeverage Python\u2019s ecosystem of libraries and tools designed to enhance\nsecurity. Here are some examples of such tools:\n\n  * Dependency Management: Use pip-audit to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.\n  * Authentication: Implement libraries like Flask-Login for secure session management.\n  * Cryptography: Protect sensitive data using the cryptography library for encryption and bcrypt for hashing.\n  * Code Analysis: Employ tools like bandit to automatically scan your codebase for security issues.\n  * Hypothesis: Utilize testing libraries like hypothesis to help weed out edge cases and odd behaviors. By integrating these resources into your development workflow, you can greatly enhance the security of your application.\n\n## 3\\. Keep Python and libraries up-to-date\n\nRegularly update the Python runtime and libraries to patch vulnerabilities and\nmaintain application security. Use modern dependency management tools like\nPoetry to efficiently manage and update dependencies.\n\n### Using Poetry\n\nStart by using poetry for its strong dependency management and packaging\nfeatures. Poetry has a built-in tool for tracking and updating package\ndependencies. To check for outdated dependencies in your project, use poetry\nshow --outdated. This command displays all dependencies that have newer\nversions. To update a specific package, use poetry update <package-name>, or\nsimply poetry update to upgrade all outdated dependencies. Poetry ensures that\nupdates follow the semantic versioning constraints in your pyproject.toml\nfile, preserving compatibility and minimizing the risk of introducing breaking\nchanges.\n\nIf you need help setting up poetry, check out my post here.\n\n### Using Pip\n\nIn environments without poetry, Pip is a useful tool for updating packages.\nUse pip list --outdated to find outdated packages. To update a package, use\npip install --upgrade <package-name> or apply pip install --upgrade to update\nmultiple packages. However, for better dependency resolution and locking\nfeatures, poetry is the preferred option.\n\nBe cautious with major version updates. They may introduce breaking changes.\nTest your application thoroughly after updates to ensure all functionalities\nwork as expected. This testing phase is crucial for identifying any\nincompatibilities or issues introduced by the updated dependencies. Address\nthem promptly to maintain stability and security.\n\n## 4\\. Implement error handling and logging wisely\n\nWhen you\u2019re creating your error handling and logging systems, it\u2019s really\nimportant to think about preventing any accidental information leakage. It\u2019s a\ngood idea to avoid showing stack traces or any sensitive data to users. When\nusing the logging module or bubbling up exceptions, make sure that\nconfidential information has been sanitized. There have been a few major leaks\nwhere user passwords or banking information have been exposed in the form of\nsystem logs.\n\nA small tip: set DEBUG = False in production, having verbose messages when\ndeveloping is really helpful. But remember to turn it off in production\nbecause you don\u2019t want to leak information regarding your environment,\nlibraries, and so on.\n\n## 5\\. Adhere to the principle of least privilege\n\nIt\u2019s critical to ensure that your Python application works well with\ndatabases, file systems, and external services. You should always adhere to\nthe principle of least privilege, which means granting only the permissions\nrequired for the job, so that the impact of a security breach is minimized.\nThis means that you should not expose more than is necessary, not only to\nother parts of your system but also to your customers. It is best to draw\nclear lines between different parts of your system, and if there is more\ncoupling, consider using a mediator to control the flow of data between these\nsections.\n\n## 6\\. Use HTTPS for data transmission\n\nUsing HTTPS instead of HTTP is a good idea when it comes to securely\ntransmitting data between your application and its users. This small but\ncrucial step can effectively safeguard against possible attacks and ensure the\nutmost protection of crucial information, such as login credentials and\npersonal data. Consider also having the communication between services\nencrypted. So it makes it harder for hackers to sniff traffic.\n\nTools like Let\u2019s Encrypt, which offers free SSL/TLS certificates and allows\nfor the consistent use of HTTPS throughout your application.\n\n## 7\\. Conduct regular security audits and reviews\n\nSecurity is a continuous process that requires regular auditing of your\ncodebase and dependencies to identify vulnerabilities. The threat of zero-day\nexploits is ever present, and some of the worst leaks of data have been due to\npoor auditing and testing. It is also important to conduct thorough code\nreviews with a focus on security. It is also wise to have regular meetings\nwith the team to discuss areas where there might be potential security\nvulnerabilities and to make sure everyone is following all current best\npractices. By taking this proactive approach, you can identify and address\npotential issues early on, ensuring that your application remains resilient\nagainst emerging threats.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nTo ensure the security of Python applications, it is crucial to adopt a\ncomprehensive strategy. This includes implementing thorough input validation,\nutilizing specialized libraries and tools, minimizing privileges, handling\nerrors cautiously, and consistently conducting audits and reviews. By\nintegrating these practices into your development process, you can enhance the\nsecurity of your Python projects, thereby protecting both your data and the\ndata of your users.\n\nCode diagnosis workshop\n\n### Free Code Diagnosis Workshop\n\nQuickly detect problems in your code and review code more effectively with a\n3-part code diagnosis framework.\n\nWatch now\n\n## Improve your code with my 3-part code diagnosis framework\n\nWatch my free 30 minutes code diagnosis workshop on how to quickly detect\nproblems in your code and review your code more effectively.\n\nWhen you sign up, you'll get an email from me regularly with additional free\ncontent.
