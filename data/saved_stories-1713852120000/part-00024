Christof Koepsel/Getty Images\n\nEuropeFootballSociety\n\n##### Jonathan Wilson\n\n###### April 18, 2024 6 mins\n\nOn Sunday, Bayer Leverkusen beat Werder Bremen 5-0 and, by so doing, wrapped\nup their first ever Bundesliga title. Five times before they had been runners-\nup \u2014 four times in the six seasons from 1996-97 when they drew the nickname\nNeverkusen \u2014 but under Xabi Alonso they have been by far the best team in\nGermany this season.\n\nThis is, however, more than a story about a triumphant underdog. It raises the\nquestion: why is such a victory not more common? How has football, the great\nuniversal phenomenon, become a sport in which only a tiny handful of clubs can\nwin? It\u2019s not just in Germany, where Bayern Munich had won the previous 11\nleague titles. Juventus won their ninth in a row in Italy in 2019-20. Paris\nSaint-German have won nine of the last 11 French titles and will surely make\nit 10 in 12 this season. In Spain, Real Madrid are likely this season to make\nit 19 of the last 21 league titles for them and Barcelona. Even in England,\ndefeats for Liverpool and Arsenal on Sunday make Manchester City favourites to\nclaim a sixth league title in seven years.\n\nIn any competition there is the obvious problem that the more successful a\nteam is, the more prize money it will accrue, and the more interest it will\ngenerate, drawing increased revenues from gate receipts, broadcasting deals,\nsponsorship and merchandise. The more money a club has, the better players it\ncan sign and so the more likely it is to win, which in turn generates more\nrevenue, creating an unhelpful cycle in which the rich increasingly dominate.\n\nWhen the first professional football league was established in England in\n1888, that danger was understood and measures taken to combat it. It was a\nvery different world, in which gate receipts represented almost all a club\u2019s\nincome. Initially, to offset the advantage of popular clubs with large\nstadiums, home sides paid away sides \u00a310. From 1919, this became 20% of gate\nreceipts. Meanwhile, to reduce the bargaining power of labour and with it the\nadvantage of the richer clubs who could afford higher wages, the system of\nhire-and-retain was established by which clubs held the players\u2019 licences: it\nmeant that even when a player\u2019s contract had expired, he could not move to a\nnew club until a deal was agreed to transfer his licence. Having reduced the\nmobility of players, the League in 1901 instituted a maximum wage of \u00a310 a\nweek.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### Why I never gave up on Manchester United\n\nBy Hanif Kureishi\n\nAs crowds declined through the Seventies, the financial struggles of league\nfootball led, in the Thatcherite economic climate, to the abolition of the\nlevy paid by home clubs to their opponents in 1981. But its influence can\nstill be felt today. Unlike in Europe, which never adopted the levy, English\nfootball for a long time didn\u2019t develop a superclub model, and even now, the\nmost successful club in English history, Manchester United, have won only 16%\nof all English league titles, while Juventus have won 30% in Italy, Madrid 38%\nin Spain and Bayern 53% in Germany. But there have also been changes from 1981\nonwards: Liverpool, the most successful side up until that point, had won 14%\nof all league titles; since then, Manchester United have won 32%. In fact,\nfive sides \u2014 United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal \u2014 have\nbetween them claimed all but five titles since.\n\nMeanwhile, the advent of the Champions League in 1992 has radically increased\nthe income available from European football \u2014 not just in terms of matchday\nrevenue, but commercial deals and broadcast revenues too. The European Cup was\nlaunched in 1955 as a knockout competition but, after Real Madrid had beaten\nNapoli in the first round in 1987-88, Silvio Berlusconi, at the time the owner\nof AC Milan, pointed out the absurdity, as he saw it, of having the champions\nof Spain and Italy, two huge markets, meeting in a direct eliminator so early\nin the competition. The outcome of his lobbying was a group stage and,\ngradually, an expansion so that, rather than just the champions, the\ncompetition now includes up to four sides from each country. After another\nrejig, two countries next season will have five. The result has been that the\ncompetition has become an increasingly closed shop: it\u2019s 20 years since a side\nfrom outside Spain, England, Italy or Germany won; in the 20 years before\nthat, nine different countries provided European champions.\n\nIn that, football follows the model outlined by Thomas Piketty in Capital in\nthe Twenty-First Century: the rich getting richer from 1980 or so onwards as\nincome is drawn increasingly to capital \u2014 that is, the results of past\nsuccess. For Piketty, what is unusual is less that trend of increasing\ninequality than the fact it was reversed in the mid-part of the century,\nsomething he puts down to large capital shocks between the beginning of the\nFirst World War and the end of the Second, including the devastation of\ninfrastructure during the wars, nationalisation, inflation and the high growth\nduring the period of reconstruction and demographic transition, leading to\nhigher bargaining power for organised labour.\n\nCounter-intuitively, English football put in place its measures against\ninequality during the Belle Epoque, when capitalism seemed to lead inevitably\nto JP Morgan-style monopolies. Although football had effectively become a\nbusiness from the moment professionalism was legalised in 1885, it was\nunderpinned by a spirit of mutual support. But even if it wasn\u2019t publicly\nacknowledged at the time, competition is good for the business of sport.\nFootball is a curious enterprise from a financial point of view, in that while\neach club strives to be the most successful it can be, what is actually being\nsold is not their excellence, but a series of contests between clubs.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### Thomas Piketty's failed revolution\n\nBy William Davies\n\nSome spectators perhaps enjoy watching an expensively assembled team of stars\nturning tricks to destroy an opponent that is little more than a patsy, in the\nmanner of the Harlem Globetrotters, or the ancient clashes between lions and\nChristians. It is true that viewing figures went up for golf and athletics\nwhen Tiger Woods and Usain Bolt were in their prime, but there is a difference\nbetween witnessing a supreme athlete pushing the boundaries of human\npossibility when it seems the opponent is less other golfers or sprinters than\nnature itself; ball sports feel futile if the opponent is just other less\nexpensively assembled humans who are obviously less good at the sport.\n\nCertainly that is the conclusion drawn by the major American sports, all four\nof which \u2014 basketball, baseball, ice hockey and American football \u2014 operate\neffectively as a cartel in which measures such as the draft (in which the\nweakest side gets first pick of the next year\u2019s talent) and salary caps help\nensure the franchises are as evenly matched as possible. What sells, they have\nconcluded, is competition. That was always the view of Richard Scudamore, CEO\nof the Premier League from 1999-2018, who pursued a policy by which the team\nfinishing first in the Premier League would receive a maximum of 1.8 times\nmore in broadcasting revenue than the team finishing 20th. In Spain that ratio\nat one point reached 17:1, although a recognition of the problems it caused\nhas brought it back to around 4.5:1. Scudamore has no doubt that relative\nequality has been a major factor in the Premier League\u2019s global success.\n\nBut inequality is growing, even in the Premier League. Scudamore\u2019s principle\nof the division of broadcast rights has been skewed by the increasing\nimportance of overseas deals. Multi-club networks are becoming increasingly\ncommon, as the giants buy up smaller subsidiaries in other countries. Premier\nLeague clubs, with foreign owners, managers and players and, increasingly,\nforeign fans, are now essentially global brands that happen to be based in\nEngland, altering the relationship between the club and its immediate\ncommunity in ways traditional fans find unnerving.\n\n\u201cThis is football\u2019s Belle Epoque moment.\u201d\n\nAttempts to impose spending caps have proved extremely difficult to implement\n(witness the 115 charges City still face for alleged offences, some of which\ndate back over a decade) and, in their present form, arguably petrify pre-\nexisting financial stratification. It\u2019s no coincidence that Premier League\nclubs, looking at how to revise the existing Profit and Sustainability\nRegulations have happened on a similar solution to that proposed by Piketty: a\nluxury tax. But it faces the same problems as Piketty\u2019s: how can it be\nenforced globally? And what restraint is it really when two of the major\nplayers are as extraordinarily wealthy as the investment arms of the states of\nAbu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia?\n\nIn his exploration of the Rawlsian nature of much of Piketty\u2019s analysis,\nMartin O\u2019Neill observes that his argument against financial inequality is not\nonly that it \u201cundermines equality of opportunity in the next generation and...\nundercuts the political equality needed for a well-functioning democracy\u201d but\nthat \u201cinequality is often counterproductive in terms of growth and economic\nefficiency\u201d, which perhaps helps explain why, complacent on their own success,\nthe likes of Juventus and Bayern can lose their grip.\n\nIt\u2019s a more straightforward tactical point to note that when teams are much\nbetter than their domestic rivals, winning most games easily, they lose the\ncapacity to defend, which perhaps explains the tendency for high-scoring games\nand dramatic comebacks in the latter stages of the Champions League in recent\nseasons (although that may be beginning to change).\n\nLeverkusen are the exception, just as Leicester were in England in 2015-16.\nBut one freak winner does not change the fundamental picture. This is\nfootball\u2019s Belle Epoque moment. It is fashionable and popular, glamorous and\nat times thrilling. Crowds, at least in England, are bigger than they\u2019ve been\nfor 60 years, and yet player wage inflation means that debt is a permanent\nstate for most of the league. The sense is of growing inequality creating a\nmounting tension; the big becoming so big that the pyramid that has sustained\nfootball for almost a century and a half is crumbling under the strain.\nLeverkusen\u2019s success and the joy it provoked in an unremarkable mid-sized town\non the Rhine is a reminder of what football can bring, and what it is in\ndanger of losing in the superclub era. It\u2019s a sport in desperate need of the\nmodern equivalent of that \u00a310 Victorian levy.\n\nJonathan Wilson is a columnist for the Guardian and Sports Illustrated, the\neditor of the Blizzard and author of Angels With Dirty Faces: A Footballing\nHistory of Argentina.\n\njonawils\n\n## Join the discussion\n\n### Join like minded readers that support our journalism by becoming a paid\nsubscriber\n\n### To join the discussion in the comments, become a paid subscriber.\n\n#### Join like minded readers that support our journalism, read unlimited\narticles and enjoy other subscriber-only benefits.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n16 Comments\n\nMost Voted\n\nNewest Oldest\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\nPeter West\n\n4 days ago\n\nI agree with the article. As an American and relative newcomer to football\n(the global kind), I am a little frustrated that the same few Premier teams\nseem to win all the marbles year after year. I love Liverpool and Arsenal, but\nwhat about West Ham and a host of others? It would be as if the NY Yankees or\nDallas Cowboys won their sport\u2019s championships year after year. Great if\nyou\u2019re a diehard Yankees or Cowboys fan, but boring for the rest of us.\n\n2\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nDennis Roberts\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Peter West\n\nI\u2019ve been watching football (soccer) since I was a kid in the 80s and it is\nmore boring now with so few teams in with a chance, even if the quality is\nhigher. And it is, of course, money and globalisation that is responsible.\n\nBut football is extremely successful, for now. It\u2019ll be interesting to see\nwhat happens if the local fanbase that go the stadiums each week starts to\ndecline \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll sell so well overseas if the stadiums aren\u2019t\nfull.\n\nIn the women\u2019s game some of the old established teams, like Donny Belles or\nSunderland, were squeezed out so that the big brands could be utilised. Man U\nabandoned their womens team not long ago, but as the female game was taking\noff in England a way was found to resurrect it and make sure the Man U brand\nwas involved at the top (it was Sunderland that lost out in that case).\n\n2\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLeonel SIlva Rocha\n\n3 days ago\n\nReply to Peter West\n\nA big thanks for NOT calling our beautiful sport Soccer!

In fact the attendance figures were declining ( as a % of possible\ncohort ) BBC TV had, until then, largely confined it`s coverage to \u201cHighlights\n\u201c( Rare full coverage to International / Cup Final etc ). There was , of\ncourse, interest but Footballers still had a maximum wage limit ( though\ncertain 1st Div clubs illegally paid more and were discreetly ignored )\nSupport was essential local to Team & location . It was the interest by TV (\neventually world wide ) that really became the \u201d game changer \u201d and continues\nto dictate the development ( or otherwise) of the \u201d beautiful game \u201c\n\n1\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nPeter B\n\n4 days ago\n\nRubbish. Football \u2013 sadly \u2013 is just another huge entertainment business. All\ntinkering around the edges does is create complexity, uncertainty and the\nopportunity for griifters to slice off their cut. Take the current \u201cfinancial\nfair play\u201d fiasco in the Premier League. No one really knows what the rules\nare. Indeed, they seem to be making them up as they go along. One month\nEverton have a 6 point deduction. Another month it\u2019s been reduced to 2 points.\nNottingham Forest have a 4 point deduction, but the appeal won\u2019t be decided\nuntil after the season finishes ... . Meanwhile, the \u201cbig six\u201d can do whatever\nthey like and never get any deductions. It\u2019s a farce. Better to keep things\nsimple and accept it for what it is. Better than feeding the lawyers and\nhangers on. If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t go, don\u2019t watch and don\u2019t pay. If you\nwant a \u201cfair\u201d football league, start one yourself. Football\u2019s got nothing to\ndo with democracy. It\u2019s a sport/business. Or Thomas Piketty. Keep politics out\nof it. Congratulations to Bayer Leverkusen.\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nReply\n\nTony Price\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Peter B\n\nAll professional sport is an entertainment business. As such it has the same\nproblems as capitalism in general, that it only properly works if it is\nregulated properly to maximise that entertainment value. As in business,\nwithout regulation you get monopolies, and that then reduces the entertainment\nvalue of the contest if the result is effectively decided before the kick-off.\n\n1\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAlex Lekas\n\n4 days ago\n\nSome years back, various American sports \u2013 except baseball \u2013 took a headlong\nplunge into parity through the salary cap. Football, in particular, was almost\nmaniacally driven by a desire for parity to sustain fan enthusiasm for the\nentire season. Attendance drops off when one\u2019s team has been eliminated from\ncontention and people disguised as empty seats is a bad look for television.\nLike everything else, this came with tradeoffs \u2013 exorbitant salaries for often\nmarginal players and annual roster changes through which clubs are more like\nmercenary units, tossing aside any vestige of loyalty. Even so, the NFL is a\nmoney-making machine. So is the NBA. Fans are far less wedded to continuity\nand watching players develop than they once were; like many other examples,\nsports is an instant gratification society in which winning is expected now.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nWyatt W\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Alex Lekas\n\nActually I\u2019d argue the salary cap often does the opposite of what you\u2019re\nsaying. It helps teams keep homegrown/drafted players. There is a 0% chance\nPatrick Mahomes would be in Kansas City if Dallas/NY/LA could spend hundreds\nof millions more than them. As a Brewers fan, this has turned me off baseball.\nAnytime we manage to get a young star, you just know you\u2019ll only have a few\nyears before they\u2019re traded for some 18 year old I\u2019ll see in the majors in 5\nyears.\n\n4\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nT Bone\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Wyatt W\n\nI don\u2019t think either one of you said anything incorrect. But the MLB is just\nso different structurally than the NFL with the most obvious being that they\nplay 145 more baseball games!\n\nBaseball has always been a grind whereas each NFL game matters. Each game is a\nmajor event. The NBA somewhere in between. Unless they cut the baseball season\nin half (fat chance), I don\u2019t see them adopting a salary cap anytime soon.\nWhat fun would it be if the Yankees and Dodgers couldn\u2019t outbid every team\nevery time!\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nSIMON WOLF\n\n4 days ago\n\nDespite the NFL Draft system who the coach & QB are seems to have had a big\neffect with for years the New England Patriots and now Kansas being so\nsuccessful and the same may be true of the Premier League with Pep at Man\nCity.In terms of spending Chelsea and Man Utd have outspent everybody else and\nyet not delivering.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nDavid Kingsworthy\n\n4 days ago\n\nI\u2019ll be interested to see who writes, and how it will be done, the story that\ncompares the corporatization of football (England would be the most\ninteresting case study) to the decline of smaller clubs along with their towns\n(Thatcherism perhaps) and then in the very modern age, the post-Bosman impact\non smaller teams corresponding to the un-Englishing of English towns.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nKirk Susong\n\n4 days ago\n\nI\u2019ve got no objection to salary caps, and there should definitely be more\ntransparency around Financial Fair Play. But to think Piketty is needed for\nthis analysis is ridiculous, and invoking him here gives his dubious form of\ncollectivism a legitimacy it does not warrant. If you own a steel mill, if a\ncompetitor goes out of business, you can keep on selling your product. If you\nown a football club, if your competitor goes out of business, you no longer\nhave a product to sell. Rich capitalists have understood the merits of\ncollectivism in these circumstances for a very long time.\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nReply\n\nDavid Giles\n\n4 days ago\n\nHow boringly predictable that this article should end with a nostalgic\nreference to player wage caps. Of yes, those young but talented lads from\nAfrica and South America are destroying football, no doubt about it.\n\nI wonder. If Picketty\u2019s analysis has much to say about the financial success\ncurrently enjoyed by the l\u201dlosers\u201d, those clubs in Leagues 1 & 2\\. Because at\nthe moment, they have never had it so good.\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nReply\n\n##### Explore\n\n  * Politics\n  * Culture\n  * Science\n  * Faith\n  * War\n  * Society\n\n##### Quick Links\n\n  * Events Calendar\n  * UnHerd Club\n  * Our Mission\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * Contact Us\n\n##### Contribute to UnHerd\n\nWe welcome applications to contribute to UnHerd \u2013 please fill out the form\nbelow including examples of your previously published work.
