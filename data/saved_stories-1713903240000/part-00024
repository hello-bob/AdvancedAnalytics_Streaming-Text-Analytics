And with the regulator expected to approve even more licences, it\nwill position South Africa as one of the continent\u2019s crypto-forward countries.\n\n\u201cAny entity that did not apply for a license and continues activities will be\ninvestigated and there will be consequences for such actions,\u201d said Felicity\nMabaso, the divisional executive for licensing at the FSCA.\n\nThe licensed entities will be subject to ongoing supervision after licensing,\nwhile investigations into people conducting crypto-related financial services\nwithout authorisation will begin.\n\nThe licences were granted to crypto companies with diverse business models,\nincluding advisory services, exchanges, payment gateways, crypto-to-crypto and\ncrypto-to-fiat conversion, crypto asset arbitrage, tokenisation, provision of\nindex-based products, and wallet services.\n\n*This is a developing story\n\nShare this article\n\n## Get the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n## More from this author\n\nNews\n\nCanal+ increases MultiChoice stake to 40.8%\n\nEphraim Modise\n\nNews\n\nSouth African used-car platform WeBuyCars sets sight on $420m valuation with\nJSE Listing\n\nEphraim Modise\n\nNews\n\nOnline payments will resume in Zimbabwe after April 12 as banks adjust to new\ncurrency\n\nEphraim Modise\n\n## Read Next\n\nNews\n\nForeign investors stage comeback to Nigeria, seeking high yields over interest\nrates\n\nJoseph Olaoluwa\n\n## Read more\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nSEC proposes \u20a61 billion capital requirement for virtual asset companies\n\nFrank Eleanya\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nFormer US agent identified as Binance executive detained in Nigeria\n\nNgozi Chukwu\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nExclusive: Two crypto startups submit licence application to Nigerian SEC\n\nNgozi Chukwu\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nKenya\u2019s $20 billion crypto market takes first step to regulation\n\nKenn Abuya\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nPatricia insists on November repayment date after DLM Trust abruptly ends\npartnership\n\nGaniu Oloruntade\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nPatricia customers to receive first batch of repayments in November as company\nappoints trustee\n\nGaniu Oloruntade\n\nTechCabal is a future-focused publication that speaks to African innovation\nand technology in depth\n\nFollow us\n\nCopyright \u00a92024.
