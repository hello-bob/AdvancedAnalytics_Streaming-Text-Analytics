At the most basic level, financial markets were created to help money flow\nfrom those who want to invest it in a good idea \u2014 to grow it \u2014 to those who\nhave a good idea and will execute on that growth. But that\u2019s not what happens\nin today\u2019s public markets.\n\n## Short-term pressures and avoidance of going public\n\nRather than connecting with investors who believe in their vision and support\nthem for long-term success, too many companies find the public markets rife\nwith short-term pressures driving an overemphasis on quarterly results. While\ngoing public used to signal a company\u2019s success, today, many founders aim to\navoid it as long as possible. So much so that the median age for a company to\ngo public has increased from six years in 1980 to 11 years in 2021^1. During\nthe same time period, the median market value at IPO (adjusted for inflation)\nincreased from $105 million to $1.33 billion.\n\nBut the problems with the current misalignment in the public markets go\nfurther. Companies that are overly focused on quarterly results are less\nlikely to invest appropriately in R&D (and therefore less innovative), less\nlikely to invest in the long-term well-being of their workers and communities,\nand less likely to care about their impact on the environment.\n\n## Identifying truly long-term companies and investors\n\nBy definition, a company that is pressured to overperform in the short-term is\ngoing to make decisions that hurt its long-term performance. Those companies\nthat are able to maintain a longer-term focus, despite the pressures in the\nother direction, do outperform over time. But because of the nearly universal\nclaims of long-term focus on both sides, it is often hard for truly long-term\ncompanies and truly long-term investors to accurately identify each other.\n\nOne thing is clear: the markets need a reliable way for these parties to find\neach other in order for the best companies, executing on the right priorities,\nto get the credit they deserve. Not only from their investors, but from their\ncustomers, their employees, and others.\n\nAccording to Edelman\u2019s Trust Barometer, 63% of employees and consumers buy, or\nadvocate for, brands that share their values and beliefs. Employees are\nwilling to take lower pay to work at a company they believe in. Many customers\nare willing to pay higher costs to buy a product from a company that operates\nresponsibly and produces the product sustainably. But with nearly every\ncompany claiming to act in these ways, how can anyone \u2014 including investors \u2014\nreally tell the difference?\n\n## Differentiation and accountability\n\nWe created the Long-Term Stock Exchange to address this core challenge. To\ncreate differentiation and a way for investors, employees, customers,\npolicymakers, and others who care about a company\u2019s responsible behavior to\ndifferentiate those who \u201cwalk the walk\u201d from those who \u201ctalk the talk.\u201d To\ngive appropriate credit where it is due to companies that list with LTSE. To\ncreate accountability, but accountability for the right metrics. Not metrics\nfocusing on quarterly EPS, but on a company\u2019s progress toward achieving its\nlong-term goals. Accountability in the short-term for the right long-term\nperformance metrics. That\u2019s what the LTSE long-term standards are designed to\ndo.\n\nAnd the accountability goes both ways. Virtually every investor claims to be\n\u201clong-term,\u201d particularly at the time of IPO. But the evidence tells a\ndifferent story. Even within an organization that is truly long-term,\nindividual portfolio managers may behave differently. So we created the LTSE\nLong-Term Score^SM that provides listed companies with information about\ninvestor behavior in their sector on the manager level, so they can better\ntarget those who are most likely to support their vision and enable the\nsuccess of the system described above.\n\n## Reinforcing alignment through governance\n\nIn a market that returns to this fundamental alignment, debates about good\ngovernance and ways for each side to protect itself still exist \u2014 but they are\nfar less divisive. Incentives and behavior align to create the long-term value\nboth sides are seeking. And there are a number of governance tools that can\nfurther reinforce that alignment. One of the roles that the Long-Term Stock\nExchange plays with listed companies is helping to identify approaches that\nhave worked and helping our companies to continue to excel in new areas.\n\nBy focusing on success metrics over the long-term, providing increased\ntransparency and commitment from companies to investors, and increased\ntransparency and evidence about investors to companies, the Long-Term Stock\nExchange is seeking to return to the fundamentals for which markets were\ncreated in the first place. When companies are positioned to fulfill their\nlong-term vision and mission, supported by investors who believe in them and\nhold them accountable for the right performance metrics, then companies,\ninvestors, employees, communities, and customers all win. That\u2019s the public\nmarket we all deserve.\n\nReferences:^ 1 https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPOs-Age.pdf\n\n#### Ready to learn more about listing on the LTSE Exchange?\n\nContact the listings team\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information contained above is provided for informational and educational\npurposes only, and nothing contained herein should be construed as investment\nadvice, either on behalf of a particular security or an overall investment\nstrategy.
