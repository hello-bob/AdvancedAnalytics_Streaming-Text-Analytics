The Collatz conjecture states that all paths eventually\nlead to 1.\n\nThe Collatz conjecture^[a] is one of the most famous unsolved problems in\nmathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic\noperations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. It\nconcerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the\nprevious term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one\nhalf of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3\ntimes the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always\nreach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence. The\nconjecture has been shown to hold for all positive integers up to 2.95\u00d710^20,\nbut no general proof has been found.\n\nIt is named after the mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in\n1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.^[4] The sequence of numbers\ninvolved is sometimes referred to as the hailstone sequence, hailstone numbers\nor hailstone numerals (because the values are usually subject to multiple\ndescents and ascents like hailstones in a cloud),^[5] or as wondrous\nnumbers.^[6]\n\nPaul Erd\u0151s said about the Collatz conjecture: \"Mathematics may not be ready\nfor such problems.\"^[7] Jeffrey Lagarias stated in 2010 that the Collatz\nconjecture \"is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach\nof present day mathematics\".^[8]\n\n## Statement of the problem\n\nNumbers from 1 to 9999 and their corresponding total stopping timeHistogram of\ntotal stopping times for the numbers 1 to 10^8. Total stopping time is on the\nx axis, frequency on the y axis.Histogram of total stopping times for the\nnumbers 1 to 10^9.

That is, for each ,\nthere is some with .\n\nIf the conjecture is false, it can only be because there is some starting\nnumber which gives rise to a sequence that does not contain 1. Such a sequence\nwould either enter a repeating cycle that excludes 1, or increase without\nbound. No such sequence has been found.\n\nThe smallest i such that a_i < a_0 is called the stopping time of n.\nSimilarly, the smallest k such that a_k = 1 is called the total stopping time\nof n.^[2] If one of the indexes i or k doesn't exist, we say that the stopping\ntime or the total stopping time, respectively, is infinite.\n\nThe Collatz conjecture asserts that the total stopping time of every n is\nfinite. It is also equivalent to saying that every n \u2265 2 has a finite stopping\ntime.\n\nSince 3n + 1 is even whenever n is odd, one may instead use the \"shortcut\"\nform of the Collatz function:\n\nThis definition yields smaller values for the stopping time and total stopping\ntime without changing the overall dynamics of the process.\n\n## Empirical data\n\nFor instance, starting with n = 12 and applying the function f without\n\"shortcut\", one gets the sequence 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\n\nThe number n = 19 takes longer to reach 1: 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17,\n52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\n\nThe sequence for n = 27, listed and graphed below, takes 111 steps (41 steps\nthrough odd numbers, in bold), climbing as high as 9232 before descending to\n1.\n\n    27, 82, 41, 124, 62, 31, 94, 47, 142, 71, 214, 107, 322, 161, 484, 242, 121, 364, 182, 91, 274, 137, 412, 206, 103, 310, 155, 466, 233, 700, 350, 175, 526, 263, 790, 395, 1186, 593, 1780, 890, 445, 1336, 668, 334, 167, 502, 251, 754, 377, 1132, 566, 283, 850, 425, 1276, 638, 319, 958, 479, 1438, 719, 2158, 1079, 3238, 1619, 4858, 2429, 7288, 3644, 1822, 911, 2734, 1367, 4102, 2051, 6154, 3077, 9232, 4616, 2308, 1154, 577, 1732, 866, 433, 1300, 650, 325, 976, 488, 244, 122, 61, 184, 92, 46, 23, 70, 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 (sequence A008884 in the OEIS)\n\nNumbers with a total stopping time longer than that of any smaller starting\nvalue form a sequence beginning with:\n\n    1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 18, 25, 27, 54, 73, 97, 129, 171, 231, 313, 327, 649, 703, 871, 1161, 2223, 2463, 2919, 3711, 6171, ...

All values tested so far converge to\n1.^[11]\n\nThis computer evidence is still not rigorous proof that the conjecture is true\nfor all starting values, as counterexamples may be found when considering very\nlarge (or possibly immense) positive integers, as in the case of the disproven\nP\u00f3lya conjecture and Mertens conjecture.\n\nHowever, such verifications may have other implications. For example, one can\nderive additional constraints on the period and structural form of a non-\ntrivial cycle.^[12]^[13]^[14]^[clarification needed]\n\n### A probabilistic heuristic\n\nIf one considers only the odd numbers in the sequence generated by the Collatz\nprocess, then each odd number is on average 3/4 of the previous one.^[15]\n(More precisely, the geometric mean of the ratios of outcomes is 3/4.) This\nyields a heuristic argument that every Hailstone sequence should decrease in\nthe long run, although this is not evidence against other cycles, only against\ndivergence. The argument is not a proof because it assumes that Hailstone\nsequences are assembled from uncorrelated probabilistic events. (It does\nrigorously establish that the 2-adic extension of the Collatz process has two\ndivision steps for every multiplication step for almost all 2-adic starting\nvalues.)\n\n### Stopping times\n\nAs proven by Riho Terras, almost every positive integer has a finite stopping\ntime.^[16] In other words, almost every Collatz sequence reaches a point that\nis strictly below its initial value. The proof is based on the distribution of\nparity vectors and uses the central limit theorem.\n\nIn 2019, Terence Tao improved this result by showing, using logarithmic\ndensity, that almost all (in the sense of logarithmic density) Collatz orbits\nare descending below any given function of the starting point, provided that\nthis function diverges to infinity, no matter how slowly. Responding to this\nwork, Quanta Magazine wrote that Tao \"came away with one of the most\nsignificant results on the Collatz conjecture in decades\".^[17]^[18]\n\n### Lower bounds\n\nIn a computer-aided proof, Krasikov and Lagarias showed that the number of\nintegers in the interval [1,x] that eventually reach 1 is at least equal to\nx^0.84 for all sufficiently large x.^[19]\n\n## Cycles\n\nIn this part, consider the shortcut form of the Collatz function\n\nA cycle is a sequence (a_0, a_1, ..., a_q) of distinct positive integers where\nf(a_0) = a_1, f(a_1) = a_2, ..., and f(a_q) = a_0.\n\nThe only known cycle is (1,2) of period 2, called the trivial cycle.\n\n### Cycle length\n\nThe length of a non-trivial cycle is known to be at least 186265759595. If it\ncan be shown that for all positive integers less than the Collatz sequences\nreach 1, then this bound would raise to 355504839929.^[20]^[13] In fact,\nEliahou (1993) proved that the period p of any non-trivial cycle is of the\nform\n\nwhere a, b and c are non-negative integers, b \u2265 1 and ac = 0. This result is\nbased on the continued fraction expansion of ln 3/ln 2.^[13]\n\n### k-cycles\n\nA k-cycle is a cycle that can be partitioned into k contiguous subsequences,\neach consisting of an increasing sequence of odd numbers, followed by a\ndecreasing sequence of even numbers.^[14] For instance, if the cycle consists\nof a single increasing sequence of odd numbers followed by a decreasing\nsequence of even numbers, it is called a 1-cycle.\n\nSteiner (1977) proved that there is no 1-cycle other than the trivial (1;\n2).^[21] Simons (2005) used Steiner's method to prove that there is no\n2-cycle.^[22] Simons & de Weger (2005) extended this proof up to 68-cycles;\nthere is no k-cycle up to k = 68.^[14] Hercher extended the method further and\nproved that there exists no k-cycle with k\u226491.^[20] As exhaustive computer\nsearches continue, larger k values may be ruled out. To state the argument\nmore intuitively; we do not have to search for cycles that have less than 92\nsubsequences, where each subsequence consists of consecutive ups followed by\nconsecutive downs.\n\n## Other formulations of the conjecture\n\n### In reverse\n\nThe first 21 levels of the Collatz graph generated in bottom-up fashion. The\ngraph includes all numbers with an orbit length of 21 or less.\n\nThere is another approach to prove the conjecture, which considers the bottom-\nup method of growing the so-called Collatz graph. The Collatz graph is a graph\ndefined by the inverse relation\n\nSo, instead of proving that all positive integers eventually lead to 1, we can\ntry to prove that 1 leads backwards to all positive integers. For any integer\nn, n \u2261 1 (mod 2) if and only if 3n + 1 \u2261 4 (mod 6). Equivalently, n \u2212 1/3 \u2261 1\n(mod 2) if and only if n \u2261 4 (mod 6). Conjecturally, this inverse relation\nforms a tree except for the 1\u20132\u20134 loop (the inverse of the 4\u20132\u20131 loop of the\nunaltered function f defined in the Statement of the problem section of this\narticle).\n\nWhen the relation 3n + 1 of the function f is replaced by the common\nsubstitute \"shortcut\" relation 3n + 1/2, the Collatz graph is defined by the\ninverse relation,\n\nFor any integer n, n \u2261 1 (mod 2) if and only if 3n + 1/2 \u2261 2 (mod 3).\nEquivalently, 2n \u2212 1/3 \u2261 1 (mod 2) if and only if n \u2261 2 (mod 3).\nConjecturally, this inverse relation forms a tree except for a 1\u20132 loop (the\ninverse of the 1\u20132 loop of the function f(n) revised as indicated above).\n\nAlternatively, replace the 3n + 1 with n\u2032/H(n\u2032) where n\u2032 = 3n + 1 and H(n\u2032) is\nthe highest power of 2 that divides n\u2032 (with no remainder). The resulting\nfunction f maps from odd numbers to odd numbers. Now suppose that for some odd\nnumber n, applying this operation k times yields the number 1 (that is, f^k(n)\n= 1). Then in binary, the number n can be written as the concatenation of\nstrings w_k w_k\u22121 ... w_1 where each w_h is a finite and contiguous extract\nfrom the representation of 1/3^h.^[23] The representation of n therefore holds\nthe repetends of 1/3^h, where each repetend is optionally rotated and then\nreplicated up to a finite number of bits. It is only in binary that this\noccurs.^[24] Conjecturally, every binary string s that ends with a '1' can be\nreached by a representation of this form (where we may add or delete leading\n'0's to s).\n\n### As an abstract machine that computes in base two\n\nRepeated applications of the Collatz function can be represented as an\nabstract machine that handles strings of bits. The machine will perform the\nfollowing three steps on any odd number until only one 1 remains:\n\n  1. Append 1 to the (right) end of the number in binary (giving 2n + 1);\n  2. Add this to the original number by binary addition (giving 2n + 1 + n = 3n + 1);\n  3. Remove all trailing 0s (that is, repeatedly divide by 2 until the result is odd).\n\n#### Example\n\nThe starting number 7 is written in base two as 111. The resulting Collatz\nsequence is:\n\n    \n    \n    111 1111 10110 10111 100010 100011 110100 11011 101000 1011 10000\n\n### As a parity sequence\n\nFor this section, consider the Collatz function in the slightly modified form\n\nThis can be done because when n is odd, 3n + 1 is always even.\n\nIf P(...) is the parity of a number, that is P(2n) = 0 and P(2n + 1) = 1, then\nwe can define the Collatz parity sequence (or parity vector) for a number n as\np_i = P(a_i), where a_0 = n, and a_i+1 = f(a_i).\n\nWhich operation is performed, 3n + 1/2 or n/2, depends on the parity. The\nparity sequence is the same as the sequence of operations.\n\nUsing this form for f(n), it can be shown that the parity sequences for two\nnumbers m and n will agree in the first k terms if and only if m and n are\nequivalent modulo 2^k. This implies that every number is uniquely identified\nby its parity sequence, and moreover that if there are multiple Hailstone\ncycles, then their corresponding parity cycles must be different.^[2]^[16]\n\nApplying the f function k times to the number n = 2^ka + b will give the\nresult 3^ca + d, where d is the result of applying the f function k times to\nb, and c is how many increases were encountered during that sequence. For\nexample, for 2^5a + 1 there are 3 increases as 1 iterates to 2, 1, 2, 1, and\nfinally to 2 so the result is 3^3a + 2; for 2^2a + 1 there is only 1 increase\nas 1 rises to 2 and falls to 1 so the result is 3a + 1. When b is 2^k \u2212 1 then\nthere will be k rises and the result will be 3^ka + 3^k \u2212 1. The power of 3\nmultiplying a is independent of the value of a; it depends only on the\nbehavior of b. This allows one to predict that certain forms of numbers will\nalways lead to a smaller number after a certain number of iterations: for\nexample, 4a + 1 becomes 3a + 1 after two applications of f and 16a + 3 becomes\n9a + 2 after four applications of f. Whether those smaller numbers continue to\n1, however, depends on the value of a.\n\n### As a tag system\n\nFor the Collatz function in the form\n\nHailstone sequences can be computed by the 2-tag system with production rules\n\n    a \u2192 bc, b \u2192 a, c \u2192 aaa.\n\nIn this system, the positive integer n is represented by a string of n copies\nof a, and iteration of the tag operation halts on any word of length less than\n2. (Adapted from De Mol.)\n\nThe Collatz conjecture equivalently states that this tag system, with an\narbitrary finite string of a as the initial word, eventually halts (see Tag\nsystem for a worked example).\n\n## Extensions to larger domains\n\n### Iterating on all integers\n\nAn extension to the Collatz conjecture is to include all integers, not just\npositive integers. Leaving aside the cycle 0 \u2192 0 which cannot be entered from\noutside, there are a total of four known cycles, which all nonzero integers\nseem to eventually fall into under iteration of f. These cycles are listed\nhere, starting with the well-known cycle for positive n:\n\nOdd values are listed in large bold. Each cycle is listed with its member of\nleast absolute value (which is always odd) first.\n\nCycle| Odd-value cycle length| Full cycle length  \n---|---|---  \n1 \u2192 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 1 ...| 1| 3  \n\u22121 \u2192 \u22122 \u2192 \u22121 ...| 1| 2  \n\u22125 \u2192 \u221214 \u2192 \u22127 \u2192 \u221220 \u2192 \u221210 \u2192 \u22125 ...| 2| 5  \n\u221217 \u2192 \u221250 \u2192 \u221225 \u2192 \u221274 \u2192 \u221237 \u2192 \u2212110 \u2192 \u221255 \u2192 \u2212164 \u2192 \u221282 \u2192 \u221241 \u2192 \u2212122 \u2192 \u221261 \u2192\n\u2212182 \u2192 \u221291 \u2192 \u2212272 \u2192 \u2212136 \u2192 \u221268 \u2192 \u221234 \u2192 \u221217 ...| 7| 18  \n  \nThe generalized Collatz conjecture is the assertion that every integer, under\niteration by f, eventually falls into one of the four cycles above or the\ncycle 0 \u2192 0. (The 0 \u2192 0 cycle is only included for the sake of completeness.)\n\n### Iterating on rationals with odd denominators\n\nThe Collatz map can be extended to (positive or negative) rational numbers\nwhich have odd denominators when written in lowest terms. The number is taken\nto be 'odd' or 'even' according to whether its numerator is odd or even. Then\nthe formula for the map is exactly the same as when the domain is the\nintegers: an 'even' such rational is divided by 2; an 'odd' such rational is\nmultiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. A closely related fact is that the\nCollatz map extends to the ring of 2-adic integers, which contains the ring of\nrationals with odd denominators as a subring.\n\nWhen using the \"shortcut\" definition of the Collatz map, it is known that any\nperiodic parity sequence is generated by exactly one rational.^[25]\nConversely, it is conjectured that every rational with an odd denominator has\nan eventually cyclic parity sequence (Periodicity Conjecture^[2]).\n\nIf a parity cycle has length n and includes odd numbers exactly m times at\nindices k_0 < \u22ef < k_m\u22121, then the unique rational which generates immediately\nand periodically this parity cycle is\n\n    (1)  \n---  \n  \nFor example, the parity cycle (1 0 1 1 0 0 1) has length 7 and four odd terms\nat indices 0, 2, 3, and 6. It is repeatedly generated by the fraction\n\nas the latter leads to the rational cycle\n\nAny cyclic permutation of (1 0 1 1 0 0 1) is associated to one of the above\nfractions. For instance, the cycle (0 1 1 0 0 1 1) is produced by the fraction\n\nFor a one-to-one correspondence, a parity cycle should be irreducible, that\nis, not partitionable into identical sub-cycles. As an illustration of this,\nthe parity cycle (1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0) and its sub-cycle (1 1 0 0) are associated\nto the same fraction 5/7 when reduced to lowest terms.\n\nIn this context, assuming the validity of the Collatz conjecture implies that\n(1 0) and (0 1) are the only parity cycles generated by positive whole numbers\n(1 and 2, respectively).\n\nIf the odd denominator d of a rational is not a multiple of 3, then all the\niterates have the same denominator and the sequence of numerators can be\nobtained by applying the \"3n + d \" generalization^[26] of the Collatz function\n\n### 2-adic extension\n\nThe function\n\nis well-defined on the ring of 2-adic integers, where it is continuous and\nmeasure-preserving with respect to the 2-adic measure. Moreover, its dynamics\nis known to be ergodic.^[2]\n\nDefine the parity vector function Q acting on as\n\nThe function Q is a 2-adic isometry.^[27] Consequently, every infinite parity\nsequence occurs for exactly one 2-adic integer, so that almost all\ntrajectories are acyclic in .\n\nAn equivalent formulation of the Collatz conjecture is that\n\n### Iterating on real or complex numbers\n\nCobweb plot of the orbit 10 \u2192 5 \u2192 8 \u2192 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 1 \u2192 ... in an extension of the\nCollatz map to the real line.\n\nThe Collatz map can be extended to the real line by choosing any function\nwhich evaluates to when is an even integer, and to either or (for the\n\"shortcut\" version) when is an odd integer. This is called an interpolating\nfunction. A simple way to do this is to pick two functions and , where:\n\nand use them as switches for our desired values:\n\n    .\n\nOne such choice is and . The iterations of this map lead to a dynamical\nsystem, further investigated by Marc Chamberland.^[28] He showed that the\nconjecture does not hold for positive real numbers since there are infinitely\nmany fixed points, as well as orbits escaping monotonically to infinity. The\nfunction has two attracting cycles of period : and . Moreover, the set of\nunbounded orbits is conjectured to be of measure .\n\nLetherman, Schleicher, and Wood extended the study to the complex plane.^[29]\nThey used Chamberland's function for complex sine and cosine and added the\nextra term , where is any entire function. Since this expression evaluates to\nzero for real integers, the extended function\n\nis an interpolation of the Collatz map to the complex plane. The reason for\nadding the extra term is to make all integers critical points of . With this,\nthey show that no integer is in a Baker domain, which implies that any integer\nis either eventually periodic or belongs to a wandering domain. They\nconjectured that the latter is not the case, which would make all integer\norbits finite.\n\nA Collatz fractal centered at the origin, with real parts from -5 to 5.\n\nMost of the points have orbits that diverge to infinity. Coloring these points\nbased on how fast they diverge produces the image on the left, for . The inner\nblack regions and the outer region are the Fatou components, and the boundary\nbetween them is the Julia set of , which forms a fractal pattern, sometimes\ncalled a \"Collatz fractal\".\n\nJulia set of the exponential interpolation.\n\nThere are many other ways to define a complex interpolating function, such as\nusing the complex exponential instead of sine and cosine:\n\n    ,\n\nwhich exhibit different dynamics. In this case, for instance, if , then . The\ncorresponding Julia set, shown on the right, consists of uncountably many\ncurves, called hairs, or rays.\n\n## Optimizations\n\n### Time\u2013space tradeoff\n\nThe section As a parity sequence above gives a way to speed up simulation of\nthe sequence. To jump ahead k steps on each iteration (using the f function\nfrom that section), break up the current number into two parts, b (the k least\nsignificant bits, interpreted as an integer), and a (the rest of the bits as\nan integer). The result of jumping ahead k is given by\n\n    f^k(2^ka + b) = 3^c(b, k)a + d(b, k).\n\nThe values of c (or better 3^c) and d can be precalculated for all possible\nk-bit numbers b, where d(b, k) is the result of applying the f function k\ntimes to b, and c(b, k) is the number of odd numbers encountered on the\nway.^[30] For example, if k = 5, one can jump ahead 5 steps on each iteration\nby separating out the 5 least significant bits of a number and using\n\n    c(0...31, 5) = { 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 4, 5 },\n    d(0...31, 5) = { 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 20, 1, 26, 1, 10, 4, 4, 13, 40, 2, 5, 17, 17, 2, 2, 20, 20, 8, 22, 8, 71, 26, 26, 80, 242 }.\n\nThis requires 2^k precomputation and storage to speed up the resulting\ncalculation by a factor of k, a space\u2013time tradeoff.\n\n### Modular restrictions\n\nFor the special purpose of searching for a counterexample to the Collatz\nconjecture, this precomputation leads to an even more important acceleration,\nused by Tom\u00e1s Oliveira e Silva in his computational confirmations of the\nCollatz conjecture up to large values of n. If, for some given b and k, the\ninequality\n\n    f^k(2^ka + b) = 3^c(b)a + d(b) < 2^ka + b\n\nholds for all a, then the first counterexample, if it exists, cannot be b\nmodulo 2^k.^[12] For instance, the first counterexample must be odd because\nf(2n) = n, smaller than 2n; and it must be 3 mod 4 because f^2(4n + 1) = 3n +\n1, smaller than 4n + 1. For each starting value a which is not a\ncounterexample to the Collatz conjecture, there is a k for which such an\ninequality holds, so checking the Collatz conjecture for one starting value is\nas good as checking an entire congruence class. As k increases, the search\nonly needs to check those residues b that are not eliminated by lower values\nof k. Only an exponentially small fraction of the residues survive.^[31] For\nexample, the only surviving residues mod 32 are 7, 15, 27, and 31.\n\n## Syracuse function\n\nIf k is an odd integer, then 3k + 1 is even, so 3k + 1 = 2^ak\u2032 with k\u2032 odd and\na \u2265 1. The Syracuse function is the function f from the set I of positive odd\nintegers into itself, for which f(k) = k\u2032 (sequence A075677 in the OEIS).\n\nSome properties of the Syracuse function are:\n\n  * For all k \u2208 I, f(4k + 1) = f(k). (Because 3(4k + 1) + 1 = 12k + 4 = 4(3k + 1).)\n  * In more generality: For all p \u2265 1 and odd h, f^p \u2212 1(2^ph \u2212 1) = 2 \u00d7 3^p \u2212 1h \u2212 1. (Here f^p \u2212 1 is function iteration notation.)\n  * For all odd h, f(2h \u2212 1) \u2264 3h \u2212 1/2\n\nThe Collatz conjecture is equivalent to the statement that, for all k in I,\nthere exists an integer n \u2265 1 such that f^n(k) = 1.\n\n## Undecidable generalizations\n\nMain article: FRACTRAN\n\nIn 1972, John Horton Conway proved that a natural generalization of the\nCollatz problem is algorithmically undecidable.^[32]\n\nSpecifically, he considered functions of the form\n\nwhere a_0, b_0, ..., a_P \u2212 1, b_P \u2212 1 are rational numbers which are so chosen\nthat g(n) is always an integer. The standard Collatz function is given by P =\n2, a_0 = 1/2, b_0 = 0, a_1 = 3, b_1 = 1. Conway proved that the problem\n\n    Given g and n, does the sequence of iterates g^k(n) reach 1?\n\nis undecidable, by representing the halting problem in this way.\n\nCloser to the Collatz problem is the following universally quantified problem:\n\n    Given g, does the sequence of iterates g^k(n) reach 1, for all n > 0?\n\nModifying the condition in this way can make a problem either harder or easier\nto solve (intuitively, it is harder to justify a positive answer but might be\neasier to justify a negative one). Kurtz and Simon^[33] proved that the\nuniversally quantified problem is, in fact, undecidable and even higher in the\narithmetical hierarchy; specifically, it is \u03a0^0 _2-complete. This hardness\nresult holds even if one restricts the class of functions g by fixing the\nmodulus P to 6480.^[34]\n\nIterations of in a simplified version of this form, with all equal to zero,\nare formalized in an esoteric programming language called FRACTRAN.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nIn the movie Incendies, a graduate student in pure mathematics explains the\nCollatz conjecture to a group of undergraduates. She puts her studies on hold\nfor a time to address some unresolved questions about her family's past. Late\nin the movie, the Collatz conjecture turns out to have foreshadowed a\ndisturbing and difficult discovery that she makes about her family.^[35]^[36]\n\n## See also\n\n  * Mathematics portal\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Collatz conjecture.\n\n  * 3x + 1 semigroup\n  * Arithmetic dynamics\n  * Modular arithmetic\n  * Residue-class-wise affine group\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  1. ^ It is also known as the 3n + 1 problem (or conjecture), the 3x + 1 problem (or conjecture), the Ulam conjecture (after Stanis\u0142aw Ulam), Kakutani's problem (after Shizuo Kakutani), the Thwaites conjecture (after Bryan Thwaites), Hasse's algorithm (after Helmut Hasse), or the Syracuse problem (after Syracuse University).^[1]^[3]\n\n## Further reading\n\n    \n\n  * The Ultimate Challenge: The 3x + 1 Problem,^[8] published in 2010 by the American Mathematical Society and edited by Jeffrey Lagarias, is a compendium of information on the Collatz conjecture, methods of approaching it, and generalizations.
