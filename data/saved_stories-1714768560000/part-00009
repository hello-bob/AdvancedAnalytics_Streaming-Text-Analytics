They feature war hero Marian Rejewski, the 1st person to crack the\nEnigma code, describing major breakthroughs before and during WWII (which the\nBritish rarely, if ever, gave proper credit to Poland):\n\n1) French X, British Y, Polish Z (0:42)\n\n2) Wiretap collection amounts needed to break Enigma (1:00)\n\n3) Breaking the Enigma code in 1932 (0:56)\n\n4) Enigma \u201cbanal\u201d A-A-A, Q-W-E keyfinding (1:31)\n\n5) The \u201cBomba\u201d machine (1:16)\n\n6) Enigma codebreaking process and how the Bomba automated the work of over 28\ncodebreakers (1:30)\n\n7) Manual codebreaking with the primitive \u201cgrill method\u201d and then the\n\u201ccyclometer\u201d, processing over 100,000 Enigma key possibilities (26x26x26)6) in\na few minutes (1:56)\n\n8) Handing over Enigma codebreaking and Zygalski sheets to the British in 1939\n(2:07)\n\n9) Polish-British cooperation on Enigma codebreaking. Poles in Paris would\nsend cracked German Enigma keys over wires to Bletchley Park using \u201calmost\ncomical\u201d protection... encrypted with the German Enigma (1:18)\n\nRelated: 2023 biography of Rejewski\n\n### Leave a Reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
