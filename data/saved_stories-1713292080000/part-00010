The requirements were fairly straightforward:\n\n  * 14 people\n  * A 7-day trip\n  * Sometime in the next 6 months\n\nThey weren\u2019t concerned about choosing the exact time yet; they just needed to\nknow which dates would work for everyone\u2014or put another way, when does it NOT\nwork?\n\nI searched but couldn\u2019t find anything that met this specific need, so I\ndecided to build it myself.\n\nThe concept is simple: think of it as an inverse Doodle. You select a date\nrange for the potential event and then ask your friends, family, or coworkers\nto mark the dates they are unavailable. This way, you can easily identify the\nbest possible time slot.\n\nThis approach allows flexibility in planning. For instance, if there\u2019s only a\n5-day stretch available, that could work too.\n\nhi@whennot.com\n\n\u00a92024 WhenNOT.com\n\nMade by Hernas.ee\n\n", "frontpage": false}
