But \u201cmagical\u201d is probably not how I\u2019d describe most public\ndrinking fountains.\n\n#### Button of the Month\n\nIn today\u2019s digital age, it sometimes feels like hardware has taken a back seat\nto the software that drives our devices. Button of the Month is a column that\nexplores the physical pieces of our phones, tablets, controllers, and beyond.\n\nWho among us hasn\u2019t walked up to a drinking fountain, expecting a bubbling\nstream of life-giving water, only to experience the crushing disappointment of\na measly trickle after smashing in that button?\n\nBut I\u2019m beginning to think it\u2019s not the drinking button\u2019s fault; they\u2019re\nactually some of the most elegant buttons out there. They\u2019re one of the few\nremaining buttons where your push directly and mechanically controls the\nresult. They\u2019re over a hundred years old. And all the action happens within an\ninch of the button itself.\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nWhen your thumb pushes that metal disc inward, you\u2019re also pressing a button\nbeneath the button that uncaps a spout inside the spout. There\u2019s a seal inside\nthat blocks the flow of water when the button\u2019s sticking out and releases it\nwhen you press down. Pushing down moves the seal that normally covers a tiny\nwaterspout inside the mechanism, letting the water through. Then, it\u2019s free to\nmove, fill up the inside of the faucet, and shoot out the fountain at around\n0.4 gallons per minute.\n\nSounds simple, right? But the genius of the drinking fountain button is that\nit\u2019s modularly repairable. That whole mechanism is part of a self-contained\ncartridge that\u2019s easy to remove and swap out.\n\nYou push button 16, which unseals tiny spigot 22 that normally blocks water\ncoming from inlet 30. It shoots around the bends and out through 34. When you\nrelease, 38 is the return spring that pushes the button back out.\n\nImage: Haws Corporation (USPTO)\n\nA quick patent search shows the cartridge idea dates back to at least the late\n1950s, and drinking fountain manufacturers have all but standardized on it\ntoday. \u201cThree of our four competitors use this same cartridge,\u201d says Bill\nEpker, a 45-year veteran of Haws Corporation, a company that started building\nand patenting drinking fountain tech in 1906. Whether you\u2019re looking at a push\nbutton, a push bar, or even one of those little silver buttons on top of a\nfaucet head, they\u2019ve almost all got the same cartridge inside, says Epker.\n\nPatent 3,902,600 shows how a similar cartridge fits inside a faucet head.\n\nImage: Packaging Coordinators (USPTO)\n\nDrinking fountains haven\u2019t always had push buttons. Haws\u2019 original 1906 design\nhad you squeeze a set of pliers-like handles, as did this earlier 1897 design\nfrom the Hyde Fountain Company. And many of the earliest drinking fountains\nhad no controls at all \u2014 Portland, Oregon, still maintains over a hundred\n\u201cbubblers\u201d that dispense water 18 hours a day, all by themselves.\n\nA review of 15 different types of \u201csanitary fountain\u201d from 1912 didn\u2019t\nshowcase a single button, only levers, twist knobs, an optional foot pedal,\nand always-running types. One 1911 patent application suggests it\u2019s because\nbuttons were pricey: \u201cThe objection to push valves heretofore has been their\nexpense.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanitary fountains\u201d were popularized in the early 1900s to prevent the spread\nof disease; earlier types had a \u201ccommon cup\u201d everyone would share.\nModifications came fast after scientists found vertical streams and a spout\nthat fits inside one\u2019s mouth weren\u2019t best for public health, either.\n\nImage: The American City, volume 6 (Google Books)\n\nBut drinking fountain giant Halsey Taylor at least imagined a push button in\nits very first patent in 1912. And by 1928, they definitely seem to have\ncaught on: a patent from that year notes that drinking fountains were \u201cusually\nequipped with push-buttons\u201d to open their valves \u2014 just without the cartridge\npart.\n\nWhy the move from levers to buttons? Haws, which actually didn\u2019t switch over\nuntil 1984, says maintenance became much easier when cartridge systems came\nalong. Modern ones even have dedicated filters to keep their internals from\nclogging as quickly, and a screwdriver hole that lets anyone with a small\nscrewdriver adjust the height of the stream \u2014 by changing the maximum distance\nthe seal moves away from the internal water port.\n\nExploded view of a Haws drinking fountain button \u2014 including the spring-\nequipped cartridge valve and the snap ring that holds the outer button on.\n\nThey\u2019re harder to vandalize, too, with no lever to break off and a silver (or\ncopper) disc cover that just spins in place if you try to twist it. Yet\nthey\u2019re still easily repairable: Haws patented a version in 2006 that lets a\nrepairperson easily remove the button and access the cartridge with a single\nspecial wrench.\n\nBut ironically, it\u2019s a lack of even that basic maintenance that turns bubblers\ninto dribblers, Haws technical product manager Josh Linn tells me. Many just\nneed their strainer cleaned out or their height screw adjusted, he says. One\nof the company\u2019s owners used to carry a little screwdriver around everywhere\nthey went to fix dribbling fountains \u2014 if you want to try it yourself, Epker\nsays a 1/8-inch flat-blade screwdriver is the largest that will fit.\n\nNot that you should need to in the US, where a shitty public drinking fountain\nexperience is technically against the law! The Americans with Disabilities Act\nrequires them to shoot a stream of water at least four inches high. Also,\ncontrols \u201cshall not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the\nwrist,\u201d and a fountain can\u2019t take more than five pounds of force from a single\nhand to operate.\n\nSo, before you blame that button, maybe let your local parks department know\nit needs fixed?\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPurely physical drinking fountain buttons may not stick around forever. Some\nrefrigerated indoor water fountains already use microswitches and solenoids to\ndispense their product, and many water bottle fillers use hands-free sensors\ninstead of buttons. Many people now pick packaged bottled water, too, even\nthough most bottled water in the US is refiltered tap water and is not\nnecessarily cleaner.\n\nBut Haws says that at least customers seem to have cooled on buying hands-free\nsensors for their normal drinking fountains now that the covid-19 pandemic has\ndied down. \u201cI would say people are falling back to mechanical operation more\nand more,\u201d says marketing manager Mike Wilhelm. \u201cFewer things can go wrong,\nit\u2019s easier to maintain over time.\u201d\n\nFor now, the button is simply more reliable.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Razer made a million dollars selling a mask with RGB, and the FTC is not pleased\n\n  2. ## Elon Musk goes \u2018absolutely hard core\u2019 in another round of Tesla layoffs\n\n  3. ## FCC fines AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing location data\n\n  4. ## Binance founder\u2019s sentencing hearing\n\n  5. ## Automatic emergency braking at speeds up to 90mph required under new rule\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from this stream Button of the month: a dive into how we interact with\nour devices on a physical, tactile level\n\n  * ### The T-Mobile Sidekick\u2019s Jump button made mobile multitasking easy\n\nMar 31, 2024, 12:00 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Today I learned about the \u201880s Casio calculator that doubles as a massive lighter.\n\nFeb 29, 2024, 8:33 PM UTC\n\n  * ### The Indiglo button let there be light\n\nJan 31, 2024, 12:00 PM UTC\n\n  * ### The forbidden popcorn button.\n\nNov 30, 2023, 4:00 PM UTC\n\nSee all 65 stories\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
