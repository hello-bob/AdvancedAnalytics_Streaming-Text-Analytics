However, these tools quickly become frustrating and get abandoned\nwhen they aren\u2019t easy to use.\n\nThe following guidelines help you increase the usability, trustworthiness, and\nusefulness of calculators, quizzes, estimators, converters, or of other\nsimilar types of tools. This article refers to all these tools as\n\u201ccalculators.\u201d\n\n## In This Article:\n\n1\\. Optimize Calculator-Tool Pages for SEO\n\n  * 1\\. Optimize Calculator-Tool Pages for SEO\n  * 2\\.

Contextualize Outputs in Meaningful Ways\n  * 10\\. Avoid Misleading Defaults\n  * 11\\. Consider Exposing the Algorithm of the Tool\n  * 12\\. Do Not Assume AI Is Necessary\n  * Conclusion\n\n## 1\\. Optimize Calculator-Tool Pages for SEO\n\nIncorporate keywords such as \"calculator,\" \u201cquiz,\u201d or \u201cestimator\u201d in the title\nof the page that hosts the tool. Users looking for guidance frequently start\non a search engine and are willing to open a calculator tool directly from the\nsearch results, even if they are unfamiliar with the organization.\n\n## 2\\. Embed Calculators directly in Webpages\n\nUsers prefer tools that are readily accessible and embedded on relevant pages\nrather than in popups or on dedicated pages. However, the embedded tool should\nload quickly. Some users in our research skipped over the calculator they were\nlooking for because they scrolled too quickly, and the tool had not yet\nloaded.\n\n\u2705 NerdWallet: The debt-consolidation calculator was embedded within the\nrelevant webpage rather than forcing users to go elsewhere to access it.\n\n## 3\\. Accommodate Variable Amounts of User Input\n\nUsers assume that the more information they enter, the more accurate the\nresults will be (somewhat like in a filter). However, not all users will be\nprepared to enter the same amount of information in a calculator. Make only\nessential inputs required.\n\nDropdowns and sliders are sufficient when precision isn\u2019t required, such as\nwhen indicating a general level of risk tolerance. Open-text fields are\nessential when users must enter unique, detailed information, such as their\nmonthly budget. When in doubt, let users type things in rather than forcing\nthem to use a slider.\n\n\u2705 Ramsey: For this insurance check-up calculator, users didn't need to enter\nthe exact amount of their yearly income. Choosing an income bracket from a set\nof options captured a sufficient level of granularity. Notice the encouraging\nverbiage Ballpark figures are fine!\u274c Ramsey: The same insurance calculator\nfrustrated one research participant because it would not allow him to select\nmultiple types of life insurance. He immediately discounted the value of the\nresults because he now knew the calculator did not fully understand his\nsituation.\n\n## 4\\. Do Not Force Users to Register to Use a Tool\n\nUsers commonly turn to calculator tools while exploring information and trying\nto understand a problem space. They will almost always choose to continue as a\nguest or otherwise use the tool anonymously when given the option. They don\u2019t\nwant to be bombarded with follow-up communications.\n\n\u2705 The Ohio State University: All participants in our research who interacted\nwith this cancer-risk calculator chose to Continue as a guest. They were\ninterested in the results, but not in an ongoing relationship with the\nuniversity.\n\n## 5\\. Provide Immediate Results on the Website\n\nUsers do not like signing up for an account or waiting for an email to see\ntheir results because, when they are using a calculator, they are just\nexploring, not committing. At the very least, present users with their results\nright on the web page, in addition to any forced registration. Users\nespecially like it when the output is dynamically calculated as they input\ntheir information, so they can see how different inputs affect the outputs.\n\n\u274c Princeton Review: After answering 24 questions about himself, a study\nparticipant had to sign up to see his results. He was particularly frustrated\nbecause he did not know registration would be required before beginning the\nquiz.\n\n## 6\\. Facilitate Easy Input Adjustments and Restarts\n\nOnce users have seen outputs, they should be able to:\n\n  * Change individual inputs without having to reenter all the other inputs\n  * Easily erase all inputs and restart the whole process\n\nFacilitating small tweaks to inputs without forcing complete restarts is most\nimportant when users have entered more than a handful of inputs. They don\u2019t\nwant to have to start all over in order to make a few adjustments. However,\nwhen the tool only accepts a few inputs, users are more likely to want to\nerase all inputs and start again.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Clare.com: This chatbot-like tool asked users a series of questions about a\nroom they will be painting before suggesting some color options. While the\ntool did properly provide a Start over button at the end, changing any\nprevious selections erased all subsequent inputs. The user must reenter\neverything that comes next, even if they did not want those fields changed.\n\nThis flexibility supports iterative exploration and helps users understand the\nimpact of different inputs on the outputs \u2014 particularly since users often\nbegin by putting in rough, estimated information to gauge the value of the\ntool. Do not expect users to be wholeheartedly committed to outputs.\n\n## 7\\. Offer to Explain the Purpose of Inputs\n\nUsers are happy to enter information when they understand how it impacts the\nvalue of the outputs. However, they hesitate when they feel the calculator is\nasking for either too much information (because it takes too much effort) or\ntoo sensitive of personal information (because they worry about privacy). In\nboth cases, provide a rationale for why the information is important for\ngenerating useful outputs to motivate users. This rationale can be visually\ndeemphasized in the interface.\n\n\u2705 Mint Mobile: The quiz offered a reason for why it needs to know whether the\nuser has paid off their phone. This pattern is even more important for more\nlaborious or personal questions.\n\n## 8\\. Help Users Understand Inputs\n\nOffer clarifications and examples of inputs if they are likely to be\nunfamiliar to nonexperts. Such clarifications could include the required\nformat, what others commonly enter, an anchor to decide what\u2019s reasonable, or\nan explanation of unfamiliar terms. (Do not recommend values when requesting\nfactual information that the user cannot change \u2014 for example, the amount of\nsavings a user has, as one investment calculator did).\n\nClarifications should be in line with the associated input fields, to help\nusers refer to them as they input information. They should not be listed in an\ninstruction block, below or off to the side of the calculator.\n\n\u274c American Heart Association: Users in our research were not familiar enough\nwith the required inputs to confidently know what to enter. The massive wall\nof text with explanations to the side of the inputs was overwhelming.\n\n## 9\\. Contextualize Outputs in Meaningful Ways\n\nFrame outputs in meaningful ways, offering interpretations or context to make\ninformation actionable. Users often turn to calculator tools because they are\nunfamiliar with the domain and cannot be expected to understand outputs\nimmediately.\n\n\u2705 Voya: One participant found it meaningful to see how her spending aligned\nwith a simple framework for Needs, Wants, and Savings. She planned to revisit\nthis calculator because she considered this framework useful.\n\n## 10\\. Avoid Misleading Defaults\n\nBe cautious with default values that can influence user assumptions about\nwhat's reasonable. For example, one user was discouraged to see he could not\nafford a home while using a mortgage calculator, only to realize later that\nthe default property-tax amount provided by the tool was more than four times\nthe typical amount in their area.\n\n\u274c Google: Although users could change the US state for which they are\nestimating a mortgage with Google\u2019s Mortgage Calculator, the estimated yearly\nproperty-tax amount did not automatically change. The inaccurate default\nproperty-tax amount overestimated monthly payments by hundreds of dollars per\nmonth if a user did not recognize that the default amount was inaccurate and\nchanged it themselves.\n\n## 11\\. Consider Exposing the Algorithm of the Tool\n\nThis is not always essential, as many users automatically trust the calculator\nbased on their trust in the provider. However, transparent explanations of how\nthe tool calculates results can enhance user trust and comprehension. A clear\nunderstanding of the tool's mechanics can align user expectations with actual\noutcomes, fostering more effective use.\n\n## 12\\. Do Not Assume AI Is Necessary\n\nWhile AI can add sophistication and power, it isn\u2019t always essential for\ngenerating useful outputs. Users\u2019 trust in a tool's algorithms comes from\ntheir perceived reliability and usefulness, not necessarily from the use of\nAI.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDeveloping a calculator tool can be difficult \u2014 especially in complex\ndecision-making domains. However, complex domains are exactly where calculator\ntools are the most valuable because that is where decision makers struggle the\nmost. Accept as much information as users will provide and iterate the design\nto generate more and more personalized outputs for differing circumstances.\n\n## Related Courses\n\n  * #### Persuasive and Emotional Design\n\nCreate delightful experiences that touch, convince, or excite your audience\n\nInteraction\n\n  * #### Information Architecture\n\nOrganize and structure information to improve findability and discoverability\n\nInteraction\n\nadaptive design,comparison,complexity,decision\nmaking,personalization,recommendations,chat bots,Search,Design Patterns\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Search Search\n  * Design Patterns\n\n## Learn More:\n\n  * In-Page Links: 3 Usability Tips\n\nHuei-Hsin Wang \u00b7 4 min\n\n  * Error Messages 101\n\nTim Neusesser \u00b7 3 min\n\n  * Transactional Notification 101\n\nFeifei Liu \u00b7 4 min\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n  * Calculators and Quizzes: User Expectations\n\nTanner Kohler \u00b7 4 min\n\n  * Comparison Tables for Products, Services, and Features\n\nKate Moran and Taylor Dykes \u00b7 12 min\n\n  * Personas Are Living Documents: Design Them to Evolve\n\nMaddie Brown \u00b7 4 min\n\n  * Five Questions for University UX Professionals\n\nTanner Kohler \u00b7 10 min\n\n  * 10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Complex Applications\n\nKate Kaplan \u00b7 12 min\n\n  * Designing for Long Waits and Interruptions: Mitigating Breaks in Workflow in Complex Application Design\n\nKate Kaplan \u00b7 9 min\n\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter\n\nGet weekly UX articles, videos, and upcoming training events straight to your\ninbox.\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Instagram\n  * Youtube\n  * Podcast\n  * Twitter\n\nCertification\n\n  * What is UX Certification?\n  * Specialties\n  * Exams\n  * UX Certified People\n\nUX Training\n\n  * Virtual Training\n  * Browse Courses\n  * Course Calendar\n\nConsulting\n\n  * Expert Review\n  * User Testing\n  * Customized Research\n  * Team Training\n  * Applied Workshops\n  * Keynote Speaking\n\nFree Guidance\n\n  * Articles & Videos\n  * The NN/g UX Podcast\n\nAbout\n\n  * Why NN/g\n  * About Us\n  * People\n  * Contact\n  * Return Policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1998-2023 Nielsen Norman Group, All Rights Reserved.\n\n  * Cookie Preferences\n  * Cookie Declaration\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
