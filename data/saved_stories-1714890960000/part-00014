And it's not about being 2x, 5x, or even\n10x better. Some of the very best engineers are 100 times more productive than\ntheir peers.\n\nPicture that: creating more value in a single day than a big-co engineer\ncreates in 3 months.\n\n## The examples are everywhere\n\nGoogle's initial team had just three people. Apple's crew was only 25-strong\nwhen they introduced the Apple II. At the point of its acquisition by\nFacebook, WhatsApp was serving 600 million users with a team of roughly 50\nengineers. Instagram's tale is quite similar, boasting 30 million users with a\nmere 13 engineers at its $1 billion acquisition. And Basecamp? It began as a\nhumble side project.\n\nSimilarly, at Better Stack we had only 3 software engineers writing code back\nin the day when we crossed $2 million in ARR, coupled with double-digit\nmonthly growth. That's an impressive \"revenue per engineer\" ratio, if you ask\nme.\n\n## It\u2019s the art of doing less\n\nImagine a \"1x engineer\" as a fresh university grad who, given enough time,\ncould build any software from scratch.\n\nThen the \"10x engineer\" is a seasoned pro with a refined intuition that helps\nthem identify the part of code that should be implemented using an existing\nopen-source library instead of building it from scratch. This doesn't mean\nthey write superior code or type faster. Rather, they understand the immense\ntime-saving potential of plugging in an existing open-source work rather than\nre-inventing the wheel. The key here, of course, is choosing the right\nlibrary.\n\nWho\u2019s the mythical \u201c100x engineer\u201d then?\n\nA \"100x engineer\" has a comprehensive understanding of the product roadmap,\nbusiness model, competition, and common customer issues as well as a detailed\nknowledge of the work needed to implement a feature. As a result, they can\njudge the cost/benefit ratio of a feature better than the product manager.\n100x engineers push back on feature definitions. They\u2019re able to cut the right\n5% of the feature to simplify its implementation by 100x.\n\n100x engineers aren\u2019t necessarily better at writing code. They better\nunderstand the context of everything absent in the task description.\n\nThey\u2019re able to take a second to judge the cost/benefit ratio of a feature\nbefore they jump into implementation. They can often do so better than the\nproduct manager or the CEO.\n\nIn the end, it's about everything an engineer doesn't have to do.\n\nYet, pragmatism and thinking from first principles can be surprisingly rare\namong engineers. We've all been guilty of over-engineering, premature scaling,\nrecreating existing libraries, and blindly following industry \"best\npractices\".\n\nBut when you manage to find a few of these 100x engineers, you're in for some\nreal magic.\n\nWe call when your website goes down\n\nGet notified with a radically better infrastructure monitoring platform.\n\nOriginally posted on the Early-stage Startup Engineering blog by Juraj Masar,\nCo-founder & CEO at Better Stack.\n\nGot an article suggestion?
