Ozempic.\n\nAmid the weight loss treatment\u2019s skyrocketing popularity, surgeons believe\nthat Hollywood is experiencing a spike in the side effect known as \u201cOzempic\nFace.\u201d\n\nSeveral doctors claimed to the Daily Mail that celebs from John Goodman to\nSharon Osborne are among those hit hardest by the alleged condition.\n\nFor the uninitiated, some side effects of taking Ozempic include sunken eyes,\ngaunt cheeks and saggy skin, often making the user appear older and more\ndeflated.\n\n\u201cOzempic face is essentially the same characteristics that we see when\npatients have rapid or regular weight loss,\u201d Dr. Smita Ramanadham, a plastic\nsurgeon in New Jersey, told the Daily Mail. \u201cWe see a loss of volume in the\nface, and when we lose fat in the face we see signs like the cheeks are more\nsunken in, more sagging skin and a general hollowing out of the features.\u201d\n\n6\n\nJessica said she never used a weight loss drug but admitted to losing 100\npounds between 2019 and 2020. jessicasimpson/Instagram\n\n## Explore More\n\n### I'm a cancer dietitian \u2014 these two things increase cancer risk\n\n### We made a freaky discovery while cleaning the toilet in our 700-year-old\nhome\n\n### Bird flu virus now found in milk, is of \u201cgreat concern\u201d to WHO\n\n6\n\nJessica Simpson visits SiriusXM Studios for SiriusXM\u2019s Town Hall with Jessica\nSimpson hosted by Andy Cohen on February 05, 2020, in New York City. Getty\nImages for SiriusXM\n\nThe injectable treatment mimics a naturally occurring hormone that tells the\nbrain it\u2019s full, thereby curbing the appetite and inducing rapid weight loss.\n\nOzempic\u2019s fat-fighting capabilities have understandably made it all the rage\nin body-obsessed Hollywood, which has allegedly resulted the aforementioned\nrise in \u201cdeflation,\u201d according to experts.\n\nAfter examining pics of 15 celebs who experienced a major weight loss\ntransformation, a panel of surgeons speculated that at least half may have\nsuffered from this facial emaciation.\n\nThe surgeons analyzed the case of actor John Goodman, 71, who shed nearly 200\npounds \u2014 nearly half his heaviest weight \u2014 since 2007.\n\nGoodman has denied taking Ozempic and the \u201cRoseanne\u201d actor credited dieting,\nexercise and giving up booze for his pound-shedding pilgrimage.\n\n\u201cYou see more lines, more wrinkles and more deflation in his face as he loses\nweight compared to when he was heavier and his face was fuller,\u201d Ramanadham\ndeclared of Goodman. \u201cThese changes are just very typical of overall weight\nloss regardless of whether weight loss drugs were used.\u201d\n\n6\n\nJohn Goodman has reportedly lost nearly 200 pounds since 2007. Rick Davis /\nSplashNews.com\n\nAlso on the list was singer Robbie Williams, 50, who admitted in the fall that\nhe was taking something \u201clike Ozempic\u201d without specifying the treatment.\n\nRamanadham believed this was evident in his visage, describing: \u201cYou can see a\nhollowing under the eyes and the cheeks and more wrinkles appearing because of\na loss of volume. With Robbie, you can see the direct results of weight loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cOzempic face\u201d was less pronounced with women, surgeons said, because they\u2019re\ntraditionally more likely to obscure flaws with fillers and makeup. However,\nthey did point to Sharon Osbourne, who reportedly lost 42 pounds on the drug,\nas the most \u201cdramatic\u201d example of the condition.\n\n6\n\nOsbourne on \u201cGood Morning Britain.\u201d Good Morning Britain/ITV\n\n\u201cHer eyes look more sunken in, her cheeks have more hollowing,\u201d claimed\nRamanadham. \u201cThere is a significant loss in facial volume as well, and more\nwrinkling that is associated with it.\u201d\n\nOther alleged Tinsel-frown sufferers included Jessica Simpson, Scott Disick\nand Liam Payne, although surgeons attributed the latter\u2019s streamlined\ncountenance to buccal fat surgery, in which the fat pad is cored out of the\ncheeks.\n\nOzempic face is one of many side effects associated with the drug, of which 9\nmillion prescriptions were written in the last three months of 2022, the Daily\nMail reported.\n\n6\n\nScott Disick on the beach in Miami on February 22, 2022.

Post a comment.\n\nAlong with causing people to lose face, the treatment has also been blamed for\nincluding vision problems, constipation and even changes in personality.\n\nMeanwhile, in January, several Ozempic adherents claimed they stopped taking\nthe drug and ended up regaining more weight than they lost.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * celebrity weight loss\n  * hollywood\n  * john goodman\n  * ozempic\n  * weight loss\n  * 4/19/24\n\nRead Next Go camping at Bloomingdale's, learn 'Sex and the City' sec...\n\n#### Top Concerts\n\nVividseats: Official Ticketing Partner of New York Post Get seats.
