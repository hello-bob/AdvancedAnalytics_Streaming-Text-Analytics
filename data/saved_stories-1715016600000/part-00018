The evaluation was\nconducted using the WAVE stand-alone API (with additional tools to collect\nsite technology and sector data). The results provide an overview of and\ninsight into the current state of web accessibility for individuals with\ndisabilities as well as trends over time.\n\nNote!\n\nResults below are from February 2024\u2014with comparisons to, and trends from,\nearlier analyses in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\nSupported by BrowserStack\n\nSupport for this research is funded in part by a donation from\n\n## The Sample\n\n### Site Lookup\n\nHow did your home page rank in our study? Enter a web site domain below to\nview details.\n\nThe million home page list was derived from the Tranco ranking which combines\nseveral sources of \"top\" web sites.\n\nSites without home pages, pages that returned errors (404, etc.), pages with\nfewer than 10 HTML elements, and pages with more than 5,000 links to the same\ndomain (for SEO purposes) were not included.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThe WAVE accessibility engine was used to analyze the rendered DOM of all\npages after scripting and styles were applied. WAVE detects end-user\naccessibility barriers and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)\nconformance failures. All automated tools, including WAVE, have\nlimitations\u2014not all conformance failures can be automatically detected.\nAbsence of detected errors does not indicate that a page is accessible or\nconformant. Although this report describes only a subset of accessibility\nissues on only 1,000,000 home pages, this report provides a quantified and\nreliable representation of the current state of the accessibility of the most\ninfluential pages on the web.\n\nNote!\n\nThe Tranco list of top web sites was used for the 2024 sample. While the\nmethodology and sources for Tranco are very similar to those used by the\nWebAIM Million in previous years, the Tranco sample includes only pay-level\ndomains, meaning domains that can be directly registered, not including sub-\ndomains. This year's sample covered a broader swath of the web with fewer\ninfrastructural domains that users would not view, such as CDNs, image and\ndata servers, APIs, etc. This minor change to sampling, plus more\ncomprehensive tests in WAVE, may account for some of the changes described\nbelow.\n\n## Detected Errors\n\nAcross the one million home pages, 56,791,260 distinct accessibility errors\nwere detected\u2014an average of 56.8 errors per page. The number of detected\nerrors increased notably (13.6%) since the 2023 analysis which found 50\nerrors/page. \"Errors\" are WAVE-detected accessibility barriers having notable\nend user impact, and which have a very high likelihood of being WCAG 2.2 Level\nA/AA conformance failures.\n\nThis chart shows the average number of detectable errors per home page over\ntime:\n\n## Home Page Complexity\n\nThe home pages tested had nearly 1.2 billion page elements. Home page\ncomplexity increased significantly in 12 months, from an average of 1050\nelements in February 2023 to an average of 1173 elements per home page in\nFebruary 2024\u2014an 11.8% increase.\n\nThe following chart shows the number of home page elements detected over the\nlast six WebAIM Million studies:\n\nThe number of home page elements increased 11.8% since 2024, and has increased\n50% in the last 5 years. 4.8% of all home page elements had a detected\naccessibility error. Users with disabilities would expect to encounter errors\non 1 in every 21 home page elements.\n\nNote!\n\nError density (number of errors divided by number of page elements) is\nprovided in the site lookup, but is an unreliable metric of site\naccessibility. A significant number of page elements (<div> and <span>\nelements, for example) may result in a lower error density (suggesting better\naccessibility), when in fact many new accessibility errors may have also been\nintroduced. This report focuses on average number of detected errors\u2014likely\nend user barriers\u2014present as opposed to error densities (how diluted those\nerrors are within page elements).\n\nThere was a correlation between page popularity and home page complexity. The\ntop 100,000 pages averaged 1,424 elements\u201445% more page elements than the last\n100,000 sites in the sample (980 elements).\n\n## WCAG Conformance\n\n95.9% of home pages had detected WCAG 2 failures. This improved slightly from\n96.3% in 2023. Over the last 5 years, the pages with detectable WCAG failures\nhave decreased by only 1.9% from 97.8%. These are only automatically detected\nerrors that align with WCAG conformance failures with a high level of\nreliability which suggests that the rate of full WCAG 2 A/AA conformance was\ncertainly lower.\n\nThis chart shows the percentage of home pages with detected WCAG conformance\nfailures over time:\n\nWhile the rate of pages with no detectable errors was very low, 22.2% of pages\nhad 5 or fewer detected errors and 31.2% had 10 or fewer. Over the last\nseveral years the proportion of pages with fewer errors has increased while\nthe number of pages with many errors has also increased\u2014pages with fewer\nerrors have gotten better while pages with many errors have gotten worse.\n\nWCAG Failure| % of Pages  \n---|---  \nLow contrast text| 81  \nMissing alternative text| 54.5  \nMissing form labels| 48.6  \nEmpty links| 44.6  \nEmpty buttons| 28.2  \nMissing document language| 17.1  \n  \nHome pages with most common WCAG failures (% of home pages)\n\nHome pages with most common WCAG 2 failuresWCAG Failure Type| % of home pages  \n---|---  \nLow contrast text| 81.0%  \nMissing alternative text for images| 54.5%  \nMissing form input labels| 48.6%  \nEmpty links| 44.6%  \nEmpty buttons| 28.2%  \nMissing document language| 17.1%  \n  \n96.4% of all errors detected fall into these six categories. These most common\nerrors have been the same for the last 5 years. Addressing just these few\ntypes of issues would significantly improve accessibility across the web.\n\nOver time the number of pages with low contrast text, missing alternative\ntext, empty links, and missing document language has decreased while the\nnumber of pages with missing form input labels and empty buttons has been\nlargely unchanged.\n\n## Low Contrast Text\n\nLow contrast text, below the WCAG 2 AA thresholds, was found on 81% of home\npages. This was the most commonly-detected accessibility issue. On average,\neach home page had 34.5 distinct instances of low-contrast text, up 13.7% from\n30.4 in 2023.\n\n## Images and Alternative Text\n\nHome pages are becoming increasingly graphical. There were over 55.6 million\nimages in the sample, or 55.6 images per home page on average, a 28% increase\nover the last year. 21.6% of all home page images (12 per page on average) had\nmissing alternative text (not counting alt=\"\"). 43% of the images missing\nalternative text were linked images\u2014resulting in links that were not\ndescriptive. One out of every four linked images was missing alternative text.\n\n14.6% of images with alternative text had questionable or repetitive\nalternative text\u2014such as alt=\"image\", \"graphic\", \"blank\", a file name, etc.,\nor alternative text identical to adjacent text or the alternative text of an\nadjacent image.\n\nThese data show that one may expect one third of the images on popular home\npages to have missing, questionable, or repetitive alternative text.\n\n## Form Labeling\n\nThe number of form inputs on home pages has nearly doubled in 5 years, with a\nnotable increase of 22.6% in the last year, from 5.0 million to 6.2 million.\n35.5% of form inputs identified were not properly labeled (either via <label>,\naria-label, aria-labelledby, or title).\n\n## Headings\n\n23.8 million headings were detected (nearly 24 on average per home page). The\nnumber (and prevalence) of heading levels were:\n\n  * 1.5 million <h1> headings (6.4%)\n  * 7.3 million <h2> headings (30.5%)\n  * 8.6 million <h3> headings (36.3%)\n  * 3.7 million <h4> headings (15.6%)\n  * 1.8 million <h5> headings (7.5%)\n  * .9 million <h6> headings (3.7%)\n\nThe number of headings present on analyzed home pages decreased 4% from 24.8\nmillion in 2023 reversing a trend of increases the previous four years.\n\nBecause headings are the primary mechanism used by screen reader users to\nnavigate content, their proper implementation is important. 16.8% of home\npages had more than one <h1>\u2014a decrease from 20.1% in 2023. There were\n1,058,992 instances of skipped heading levels (e.g., jumping from <h2> to\n<h4>)\u2014one in every 22 headings. Skipped heading levels were present on 37.9%\nof all pages, down from 42.2% in 2023. 11.3% of pages had no headings present\nat all, up from 7.9% in 2023.\n\n## Regions\n\n76.7% of home pages had at least one region (or ARIA landmark) defined\u2014a\ndecrease from 80.9% in 2023 (though an increase from all previous years). A\n<main> element or main landmark was present on 39.1% of home pages, down\nslightly from 41.5% in 2023 (though an increase from all previous years).\n15.5% of home pages had a \"search\" landmark, down from 21% in 2023.\n\n## ARIA\n\n89,050,856 ARIA attributes were detected\u201489 per page on average! ARIA code\nusage increased 15% in just one year and has more than quadrupled since 2019.\n\nThis chart shows the number of ARIA attributes per home page over time:\n\nThe prevalence of ARIA labels and descriptions increased 26% in just the last\nyear. Home pages averaged 19.2 aria-label, aria-labelledby, or aria-\ndescribedby attributes.\n\n74.6% of the one million home pages used ARIA (excluding ARIA landmark roles).\nHome pages with ARIA present averaged 34.2% more detected errors than those\nwithout ARIA\u2014one would expect to encounter an additional 15 potential barriers\non home pages with ARIA present.\n\nIncreased ARIA usage on pages was associated with higher detected errors. The\nmore ARIA attributes that were present, the more detected accessibility errors\ncould be expected. This does not necessarily mean that ARIA introduced these\nerrors (these pages are more complex), but pages typically had more errors\nwhen ARIA was present.\n\n6.7% of home pages had an ARIA menu (role=\"menu\", up from 5% in 2023), but 28%\nof ARIA menus introduced accessibility barriers due to the lack of necessary\nARIA menu markup and interactions.\n\nHome pages also averaged 15.5 aria-hidden=\"true\" attributes (up from 13.7 in\n2023, 11.0 in 2022, 8.9 in 2021, and 6.6 in 2020) and 3.1 role=\"button\"\nattributes (down from 3.4 in 2023, but up from previous years). Home pages\naveraged 23.1 instances of tabindex=0 or tabindex=-1 (up 16% from 19.9 in 2023\nand up 95% from 2020).\n\n## Links\n\n13.2% of pages had ambiguous link text, such as \"click here\", \"more\",\n\"continue\", etc. (a decrease from 17.3% of pages in 2023). These pages had 6.3\ninstances of ambiguous links on average.\n\n## Skip Links\n\n13.3% of home pages had a \"skip\" link present, down from 17.2% in 2023. One\nout of every 10 \"skip\" links were broken\u2014either they were hidden in a way that\nmade them inaccessible or the link target was not present in the page.\n\n## Doctypes\n\n91.6% of home pages had a valid HTML5 doctype\u2014an increase from 89.8% in 2023,\n86.1% in 2022 and 79.1% in 2021. Pages with a valid HTML5 doctype had\nsignificantly more page elements (average of 1213 vs. 745) and detectable\nerrors (average of 57.1 vs. 53.2) than pages with other doctypes. 511 unique\ndoctypes were encountered in the million-page sample.\n\n## Site Categories\n\nNote!\n\nWe're grateful for the support of webshrinker.com for providing us the site\ncategory data. Their support makes this valuable information available.\n\nThe one million home pages were categorized based on content into IAB Content\nTaxonomy categories. The table below shows the average number of errors in\neach category and the percent difference in errors for that category from the\naverage of 56.8 errors for the entire million-page sample. In other words, the\npercentage difference is how much better or worse that category is than the\naverage home page.\n\nCategory| Avg. # of errors| % difference  \n---|---|---  \nGovernment| 35.7| \u221237.2%  \nSocial Media| 40.9| \u221228.0%  \nTechnology & Computing| 41.8| \u221226.4%  \nLaw, Government, & Politics| 43.1| \u221224.1%  \nBusiness| 44.3| \u221222.0%  \nSociety| 44.8| \u221221.0%  \nEducation| 48.3| \u221215.0%  \nCareers| 48.9| \u221213.8%  \nPersonal Finance| 49.2| \u221213.4%  \nFamily and Parenting| 50.8| \u221210.6%  \nScience| 50.9| \u221210.4%  \nFood and Drink| 51.6| \u22129.1%  \nHealth and Fitness| 51.7| \u22129.0%  \nReligion and Spirituality| 58.7| +3.3%  \nArts and Entertainment| 60.4| +6.3%  \nTravel| 64.7| +13.8%  \nHobbies and Interests| 66.2| +16.5%  \nPets| 66.3| +16.7%  \nAutomotive| 66.5| +17.1%  \nHome and Garden| 67.6| +19.1%  \nNews/Weather/Information| 69.5| +22.3%  \nAdult Content| 72.9| +28.3%  \nReal Estate| 75.1| +32.2%  \nStyle & Fashion| 77.3| +36.1%  \nShopping| 83.3| +46.6%  \nSports| 84.9| +49.4%  \n  \nThere were notable differences in accessibility errors for sites in different\ncategories. Sports, shopping, style & fashion, real estate, and adult content\nhome pages, for example, had over twice the number of errors on average as\ngovernmental web sites.\n\n## TLDs\n\n1068 unique top-level domains (e.g., com, .tv, .fashion, etc.) were\nrepresented in the million pages analyzed.

The data suggest that ads were among the\nstrongest harbingers of accessibility errors. Home pages that utilize the\ncommon Google AdSense system had 12.3 more errors on average.\n\n### Other technologies\n\nOther common technologies also correlated to more errors:\n\n  * 12.9% of pages had ReCAPTCHA (down from 14.4% in 2023), and these pages had 8.1 more errors than average.\n  * 13.4% of pages (up from 11.5% in 2023) were detected as having Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and these pages had 3.1 more errors than average.\n\nWeb sites that used common cookie compliance technologies, such as OneTrust\nand CookieYes averaged notably fewer errors than average, whereas sites that\nused browser fingerprinting technologies commonly used for user tracking\naveraged significantly more errors than average. Sites that used FingerprintJS\nand ClientJS for user tracking averaged nearly twice and over ten times as\nmany errors respectively. This may suggest a relationship between user privacy\nand accessibility practices.\n\n1,126,054 tables were observed (up from 1,064,331 in 2023) on 162,377 pages.\nOnly 189,546 (16.8%) of the tables had valid data table markup.\n\nWeb sites with common accessibility overlays detected averaged fewer\ndetectable errors than average.\n\n  * AudioEye - 36.9 errors\n  * UserWay - 42.9 errors\n  * accessiBe - 50.5 errors\n\nNOTE: Overlays that manipulate WAVE results were disabled before the testing\noccurred.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur 2024 analysis saw a notable increase in the number of detected\naccessibility errors, though a small decrease in number of pages with WCAG\nconformance failures. Despite increased errors, there were several positive\ntrends. Pages with fewer errors in the past generally got better, suggesting\nthat increased focus on accessibility is impactful. Also, the prevalence of\nseveral error types, such as low contrast text and missing alt text decreased.\nSome sectors, such as government and education, fare much better than others\nindicating regulation and supports have a positive impact on accessibility. We\nat WebAIM hope that this report will help influence improved accessibility.\n\nLast updated: Mar 28, 2024\n\n## Related Resources\n\n  * WAVE Accessibility Evaluation Tool\n  * WAVE Stand-alone API\n\n## \u00a92024 WebAIM\n\nInstitute for Disability Research, Policy, and Practice Utah State University\n6807 Old Main Hill Logan, UT 84322-6807 435.797.7024\n\n## Check Your Accessibility\n\n## From the Blog\n\n  * Web Accessibility in the 2024 Presidential Campaigns\n  * Screen Reader User Survey #10 Results\n  * WebAIM and BrowserStack: Allies for Digital Accessibility Excellence\n  * An Evolution in Microsoft Office Accessibility\n\n## Popular Resources\n\n  * WebAIM Training\n  * WCAG 2 Checklist\n  * WebAIM Monthly Newsletter\n  * Color Contrast Checker\n  * Web Accessibility for Designers\n  * WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool\n\n  * Contact\n  * About\n  * RSS Feeds\n  * Twitter\n  * Copyright & Terms of Use\n\n", "frontpage": false}
