In fact, many people believe that\nsoft skills are somehow innate and cannot be learned, but based on my\nexperience, I can easily say that this is not the case.\n\nThat's why in today's article, we will delve deeper into soft skills and, in\nparticular, we will cover these points:\n\n  * \ud83e\udd4a Hard Skills vs Soft Skills: their definitions and the differences between the two.\n\n  * \ud83e\udd4e Main Soft Skills: we\u2019ll explore the top soft skills and how to develop them.\n\n  * \u2696\ufe0f How to Balance Soft Skills: we\u2019ll discuss which soft skills to prioritize based on your career path.\n\nAs you can see, we have much to cover, so let\u2019s get started!\n\n##\n\n\ud83e\udd4a Hard Skills vs Soft Skills\n\nLet's begin by defining what hard skills and soft skills are:\n\n  * \ud83e\ude9a Hard Skills: the specific knowledge and abilities required to perform a job. This category could include skills like proficiency in a certain programming language, understanding system architectures, or a degree or certification in a specific field.\n\n  * \ud83d\udecf\ufe0f Soft Skills: personal traits and behaviors that help you work well with others and adapt to changes. They include how well you communicate, work in a team, solve problems, and manage your time.\n\nIn this newsletter, I have already mentioned that in recent years, we\u2019ve\ntransitioned from a \u201clow-level era\u201d, where those who understood technology\nwere seen as untouchable gurus, to a \u201chigh-level era\u201d, where technology has\nbecome mainstream and what truly makes a difference are people.\n\nIf we examine this in terms of skills:\n\n  * \u2b07 low-level era \u2192 hard skills were privileged\n\n  * \u2b06 high-level era \u2192 soft skills are privileged\n\nThis is to say that soft skills are no longer a nice-to-have for engineers;\nthey are a requirement for every engineer, especially now with the advent of\nAI.\n\nYou might be tempted to think that soft skills are only needed at the\nleadership level, but that\u2019s not the case. What varies between roles is simply\nthe balance between hard and soft skills, as we will discuss later.\n\n###\n\nDifference Between Hard and Soft Skills\n\nMany believe the main difference is that soft skills are related to\npersonality and can\u2019t always be learned, while hard skills are often acquired\nthrough formal education or specific training.\n\nThis is simply a misconception.\n\nSoft skills, like hard skills, can be learned, studied, and taught. What is\nprobably true is that soft skills are usually more intangible, making\nacquiring them more challenging.\n\nJust to give you an example:\n\n  * If you want to learn Python (a hard skill), you take a course or read a book. With some commitment, you can easily learn it and put it into practice by creating a simple app that could work.\n\n  * If you want to learn communication (a soft skill), courses, books, and teachers are still available, but having direct feedback to perceive your progress will be much harder.\n\nBut this shouldn\u2019t stop you from learning and trying.\n\n##\n\n\ud83e\udd4e Main Soft Skills for Engineers and Managers\n\nThe realm of soft skills is immense, and it would be impossible to list and\ndiscuss all of them. For this reason, I\u2019m only going to consider the ones that\nare fundamental to the engineering world.\n\nThe importance of these can vary based on you, your company, their culture,\nand many other aspects, but I believe the following list covers the most\nimportant ones, which I also look for during my interviews.\n\nFor your convenience, I divided them into five categories:\n\n  * \ud83e\udde0 Personal Skills\n\n  * \ud83e\udd1d Interpersonal Skills\n\n  * \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Communication Skills\n\n  * \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Organizational Skills\n\n  * \ud83d\udc51 Leadership Skills\n\nLet\u2019s now go through all of these, and for each one, understand how they can\nbe useful and how they can be trained. I will also rank based on what I value\nmost when seeking engineers or EMs.\n\n###\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Personal Skills\n\nPersonal skills include a range of capabilities that relate to one's ability\nto manage themselves and navigate daily life's personal and professional\nchallenges.

Therefore, personal and interpersonal skills are probably the most important.\n\n  * Tech Lead: in this role, along with personal and interpersonal skills, since you will have to lead technical projects, it\u2019s crucial to focus on organizational skills.\n\n  * Engineering Manager: a good EM should be able to balance all four categories, but organizational and leadership skills become more important.\n\n  * Engineering Leader: as an engineering leader, both leadership and interpersonal skills become crucial.\n\n##\n\n\u270c\ufe0f That\u2019s all folks\n\nThat's all for today!
