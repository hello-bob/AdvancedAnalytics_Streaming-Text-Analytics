In this conversation, a16z General Partner David\nHaber talks with Marco Argenti, the chief information officer at Goldman\nSachs, about bringing fintech processes into financial services, turning\ndevelopers into clients, and how AI is a major inflection point in the history\nof technology.\n\n## Episode Transcript\n\nThis transcript has been condensed and edited for readability and clarity.\n\nDavid Haber: Marco, thank you so much for joining. I had the pleasure of\nworking with you during my time at Goldman, and I was really excited to chat\nwith you. You\u2019ve had a fascinating career, really at the forefront of a bunch\nof technology platform shifts. Maybe you could walk us through a bit of your\ncareer arc, what were the key learnings from each of those different periods,\nand how does that inform what we\u2019re going through today?\n\nMarco Argenti: I\u2019ve been in technology pretty much all my life. I\u2019ve tried\ndifferent fields within technology, but it was always technology-centered. And\nsince I was a kid, I was fascinated by computers, I was fascinated by the fact\nthat you could have this impossibly malleable state machine that, potentially,\nyou can get it to do whatever you wanted.\n\nAnd so all that within a computer, in a completely virtual world was something\nthat made me dream of something bigger. I started just with regular software\ndevelopment, doing software of different kinds. And then I started selling. I\nhad my own startup, but then really it was the internet that changed\neverything. And as a result of that, I moved to Canada in the \u201990s where I was\nfascinated by this idea of the limitless distribution of knowledge, which is\nsomething that we will reconnect when we talk about AI.\n\nDavid: Totally.\n\nMarco: And so I started an internet company in the \u201990s. We started one of the\nvery first online stores. In fact, we launched a little bit before Amazon.\nObviously, we weren\u2019t as successful. Timing was great, something else about it\nwasn\u2019t. And that was relatively successful. And also in collaboration with\nMicrosoft, we built some of the largest online stores back then in the U.S.\nBut then mobile was the next obvious thing. And it was really early days.\nWe\u2019re talking about 1999 or so.\n\nI actually moved to Europe where a friend of mine was doing an IPO of a\ncompany and he acquired the mobile company almost as an afterthought. And so I\nbecame the CEO of that company, it was called Wireless Solutions. And then we\nstarted to really go down the path of mobilizing the internet, creating\ninfrastructure for others to create mobile websites.\n\nSo, then I went into apps. I went into this idea that the mobile web was\nprobably not rich enough for a small screen and for the experiences, so we\nstarted actually the first app store that I know of, the Ovi Store, which got\npretty successful because of the install base. So, we were doing something\nlike 70 million downloads a day or something like that. So, it was actually\nquite a big thing. And I guess that was one of the biggest learnings of my\ncareer, which is, again, you need to be the biggest user of your own product.\nAnd the second one is that sometimes, little subtleties in user experience\nhave a disproportionate effect. Obviously, at that time, I was dealing with a\nlot of app developers. Apps require a backend and those developers were really\ngreat at doing the application on the phone, but then it was actually hard for\nthem to do a backend, to stand up at the server side of things. Sometimes apps\nhad literally a server under people\u2019s desk as a backend.\n\nSo, this whole idea of a computer on tap was so fascinating for me. And so\nwhen Amazon called me and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey you want to come with us and do\nyou want to actually start the mobile services, backend business within AWS?\u201d\nI jumped to the opportunity. And that led me to start to talk to a lot of\ncompanies that were in manufacturing, because we were getting into IoT and\nsupply chain, and then I started to talk to CEOs about the whole idea of\ndigital transformation.\n\nI started to feel like it\u2019s pretty clear that technology is really moving from\nthe back office into the center of the strategic agenda for CEOs. I was\ntalking to the CEOs of Volkswagen, Philips, and other companies, and all of\nthem, the common theme was, \u201cWe\u2019re starting to actually be limited by our\ntechnology capabilities with regards to our competitiveness and we need to\nreally form and train a muscle, a technology that is just as good as any other\ncompany, including technology company.\u201d So, then I met David Solomon at\nre:Invent, which is the AWS conference where he was speaking, and then we\nstarted to talk and it was pretty clear that Goldman had the same vision that,\nespecially in the world of finance, technology will play a disproportionately\nimportant role. And that\u2019s what led me ultimately to join Goldman in 2019.\n\nDavid: Maybe you can talk about that transition, coming from a business like\nAWS to financial services, which I think was new for you. What were some of\nyour expectations versus reality?\n\nMarco: One of the big things when you do a transition from a tech company to a\ncompany in a different sector is whether that sector is regulated or not. And,\nof course, regulation is something that can be a barrier and you can think\nabout that as slowing innovation. But then I learned maybe from my control\ntheory background, which I studied in university, that you can actually use\ncontrols at your own advantage to gain velocity in the long term. So, that was\na big learning and adaptation where regulation and other controls are actually\nvery important for sustained speed of innovation. So, you might be slow at the\nbeginning, but then eventually you\u2019ll gain velocity. And so that was something\nthat, I think, anybody that comes into a regulated industry has to realize.\n\nThe other thing is really introducing in the engineering team the concept of\nworking backwards from the customer and really turning it into a principle\nthat everybody can understand. So, we developed this leadership talent for\nengineers, the first of which is build with purpose. And it sounds fuzzy if\nyou talk about it and, kind of sort of obvious, but really this idea that in\norder to be good engineers needed to really sit down with the businesses and\nreally deeply understand the why. Because engineers they tend to start from\nthe how. So, if you get a bunch of engineers in a room for example, if they\nneed to do a web project, you can count the seconds before the discussion on\nframeworks come up. Right? And that\u2019s a good discussion, but not a discussion\nI would start from.\n\nSo, this idea of saying, \u201cOkay. We need to ask ourselves fundamental\nquestions. Who\u2019s the client? And really what is the problem, the opportunity\nthat we\u2019re trying to solve? And then how do we measure that? How do we know\nthat that\u2019s actually something that the client will like?\u201d Those questions and\nthen having them written into narratives, fundamentally started to change the\nculture. Because engineers tended to get really fuzzy requirements from the\nbusinesses and then kind of go into sort of a series of approximation. Whereas\nthis idea of shifting left and actually writing down a plan that is very solid\nthat any business person can understand before you write the first line of\ncode. And so this idea of introducing the concept of platforms was extremely\nimportant to speed us up.\n\nDavid: And I recall that being actually a really important message I feel like\nthat you brought to the firm, which was we\u2019re gonna make the developer our\nclient. And I think it was one of the first times that Goldman began thinking\nabout the developer as a client. Maybe talk a little bit about that shift.\n\nMarco: Yeah, and that was definitely new. Remember when I said that you need\nto understand as a leader what your clients are thinking by trying your own\nproduct. And I think also today, given the importance of developers, I think\nit\u2019s also responsibility of a leader, not only technologists to try to really\nunderstand what developers are thinking and what they want and how they think\nand meet them where they are externally and internally. Because sometimes,\neven externally in your clients, the decision makers are not only the business\npeople, but are also the choice of technology, which leads then to the choice\nof a service, is done by developers.\n\nAnd so you really need to think of them as decision-makers even when you\u2019re\ndealing with an external client. And we\u2019re seeing that more and more every\nday.\n\nDavid: Goldman famously had built a lot of internal systems. How do you today\nthink about leveraging internal engineering resources in terms of building\nsoftware?\n\nMarco: So, at the very beginning, we introduced our digital strategy tenets,\nif you remember, and one of them was look outside first before you build. Just\nbecause you have a bunch of smart people, you don\u2019t necessarily need to build\neverything. And I think to me, the the acid test is where do I actually want\nto employ my best people and my best resources, into which kind of tasks? And\nis that something that will create some form of competitive differentiation or\ncontribute to the growth of the business, etc.? If the problem is already\nbeing solved by someone else, there isn\u2019t really a good argument to actually\nbuild it yourself. And also it doesn\u2019t just apply to vendor software, it\napplies to open source in general. Obviously open source is an incredible\nwealth of intellectual property where there is tens of thousands or millions\nof people that have actually spent hundreds of millions of hours in figuring\nout some of the most difficult problems.\n\nThe first questions is, \u201cwhat is out there that could actually give us this\nfunctionality?\u201d And then, of course, you go into a very rigorous selection\nprocess because you need to make sure that the solution is widely adopted,\nthat is supported, that is safe, is secured, etc, etc. So, in many cases, we\ndecide to use a vendor or we decide to use open source, and then we build the\nscaffolding around it to make sure that, A.) it integrates with our systems\nand with our data, B.) it operates in a compliant and safe and secure way. But\nthen at the core, the functionality, it\u2019s something that you can leverage to\nmake sure that you\u2019re removing this undifferentiated heavy-lifting in a way\nand really focus on things that are creative to your business. Open source is\nsomething that, of course, you need to be careful about, you need to be\nextremely selective, but it can actually help a lot.\n\nDavid: It feels like we are entering a new platform shift with AI. How are you\nthinking about generative AI? What is Goldman Sachs already doing with it?\n\nMarco: I would start by saying that, despite all the skepticism that I tried\nto apply and trying to suspend suspension of belief in this case, but I\u2019m\npretty profoundly convinced that at this point, that we really hit a major\ninflection point in technology that has really profound impact. There are\nsocietal impacts and business impacts. In my history of 40 years, it\u2019s\nprobably bigger than any of the revolutions that I\u2019ve seen. Also, because of\nhow quickly that became almost an essential tool for everyday life for a lot\nof people that I know, including myself and my daughter.\n\nThere was a time in which in order to study a subject, I needed to physically\ngo to a library, and then it took me hours before I could actually read\nsomething. If I didn\u2019t understand the subject deeply enough, I had to match\nmyself to the right book, which was not easy, and then climb this ladder of\nknowledge until I was finally equipped to understand a certain subject.\n\nPhysical barrier removed, but knowledge barrier was still there from the age\nof Gutenberg to now hasn\u2019t really changed. It has changed now. That\u2019s why I\nsometimes compare the invention of AI to the invention of the printing press\nin a way that it removed a major barrier. First one was a physical barrier.\nThis one is a knowledge barrier. Your prompt most often determines your level\nof knowledge and the AI actually explains things to you that are attuned to\nthat level of knowledge. And then you can climb that ladder by asking more and\nmore questions and interactively the AI will get deeper and deeper into a\nsubject. It\u2019s almost like having a personal tutor that can be available now to\nbillions of people, which is kind of unprecedented. And I think that will have\nprofound repercussions on the way we shape the education system and the way we\nshape just the access to knowledge, but also how quickly you can ramp up and\nbecome proficient in your own job.\n\nWe think about it in Goldman as a sort of a spectrum where on the left side,\nwhich is the more immediate opportunity, it\u2019s the impact on productivity. And\nI think that could be pretty significant, possibly one of the potentially most\nsignificant productivity enhancements that we\u2019ve seen. And then you walk the\nspectrum all the way on the right side where you have more like alpha\ngenerating or growth generating use cases, which might not return on\ninvestment right away because you actually might need to train your AI, you\nmight need to make it really understand your business and we require\ninvestment.\n\nOne of the things I am really keen on is, hey, this is something really new\nthat we profoundly do not understand. Nobody really understand AI profoundly\nyet. The things that we don\u2019t know are probably more than the things that we\nknow. So, we need to sandbox that into an environment that will allow us for\nsafe innovation and safe experimentation. So, we have set up a working group\nor a committee that reviews all the ideas where we selected out of hundreds of\nideas, we\u2019ve selected about 15 or 19 actually at this point that we\u2019re at\ndifferent phases of piloting.\n\nI think the very first thing that we\u2019re actually starting to be using AI at\nscale is developer productivity, back to developers, right? And we\u2019re seeing\nthe developer productivity go up can be anywhere from 10% to 40% depending on\nthe developer, depending on the use case, which is massive, even if it stays\nat 10%. But then also it has a direct impact on developer happiness, which by\nthe way, you and I know that it is one of the most important factors for\nproductivity is pretty well understood. And then, of course, it\u2019s a journey\nbecause at the beginning, you implement tools that are generic, but then you\nstart adapting the whatever copilot type of AI you\u2019re using for your\ndevelopers with institutional knowledge.\n\nDavid: People may not know that Goldman has thousands of engineers. So, even\njust the 10% to 40% impact on productivity can have a significant impact on\nthe bottom line.\n\nMarco: But then you can extend that to how many of our 45,000 are actually\npeople that are in the knowledge business. I mean, it\u2019s most of them, right?\nAnd so then when you started expanding to that, to bankers, to investors to\npersonal, you know to private wealth managers, and then even eventually to\nregister investment advisors. So, that knowledge, it\u2019s so powerful because, at\nthe end of the day, it changes not only your own productivity, but also your\ndynamics with your clients. And then eventually will actually become the new\nnormal in the way actually clients expect to deal with you and actually can\ncreate the competitive differentiation on the way we actually create products\nand make decisions and create strategies and so on and so forth.\n\nDavid: I\u2019m curious what you think AI\u2019s impact might be on financial services\nas an industry maybe 10 to 15 years from now.\n\nMarco: It\u2019s funny because this is one of those things in which it\u2019s even hard\nto predict the next six months, right?\n\nDavid: It\u2019s moving very quickly.\n\nMarco: With the speed that things that are evolving, and there are still very\nbig open questions right now. First of all, it will be a sort of a table-\nshifting type of phenomenon where it will create new leaders, it will\nreinforce a position of some of the leaders that are actually able to be at\nthe forefront of this and be able to leverage that in the proper way. So, I\nthink it will create differentiation, for sure. I think one trend in financial\nservices has been that speed is becoming more and more of a factor. Price is\nimportant, but how quickly you can price is also very important, especially\nwith some clients. And the switch from batch to real-time and more like having\na real-time business where you need to make decisions really fast that you\nneed to settle really quickly, that you need to go through front to back\nextremely quickly.\n\nAnd so all that, I think, this shift towards more of a real-time business is\nsomething that AI definitely will accelerate. The ability to have very complex\nmodels of the world and of the economy. I think the relationship with clients\nwill change. And as I said before, the expectation of clients of you being\nextremely good at providing personalized advice, personalized portfolios,\nunderstanding deeply what are the repercussions of certain events in your\ninvestment strategy, and being able to provide that kind of information at a\nspeed and at a level of quality that is probably unprecedented.\n\nDavid: Marco, thank you so much for the time. Always a pleasure.\n\nMarco: David, thank you so much.\n\n### Want more a16z Fintech?\n\nSign up for commentary and analysis on recent news, and compelling trends in\nthe fintech space.\n\n###### Thanks for signing up for the a16z Fintech newsletter.\n\nCheck your inbox for a welcome note.\n\nMANAGE MY SUBSCRIPTIONS By clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the\nPrivacy Policy.\n\nContributor\n\n  * David Haber is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, where he focuses on technology investments in financial services.\n\n    * Follow\n    * X\n    * Linkedin\n\nMore From this Contributor\n\n  * In the Vault: Finding a Single Source of AI Truth With Marty Chavez From Sixth Street David Haber\n  * Managing Your Facility and Tools to Automate the Process David Haber, Melissa Wasser, and JJ Yu\n  * Investing in Crux David Haber, Marc Andrusko, and Michelle Volz\n  * B2FI: Demystifying Software Sales Into Financial Institutions David Haber, Sumeet Singh, Brad Kern, and Katy Nelson\n  * It\u2019s Time to Raise Your Debt Facility: Execution Tactics for Founders David Haber, Melissa Wasser, and JJ Yu\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management,\nL.L.C.
