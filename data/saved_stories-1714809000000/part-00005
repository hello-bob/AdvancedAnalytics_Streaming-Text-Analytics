I was only 11 years old, working from my dad's Tandy 1800HD laptop\nand a 2400 baud modem. The Cave BBS soon grew into a bustling 24-hour system\nwith over 1,000 users. After a seven-year pause between 1998 and 2005, I've\nbeen running it again ever since. Here's the story of how it started and the\nchallenges I faced along the way.\n\n## Enter the modem\n\n### Further Reading\n\nModems, wArEz, and ANSI art: Remembering BBS life at 2400bps\n\nIn January 1992, my dad brought home a gateway to a parallel world: a small\nblack plexiglass box labeled \"ZOOM\" that hooked to a PC's serial port. This\nmodem granted the power to connect to other computers and share data over the\ndial-up telephone network.\n\nWhile commercial online services like CompuServe and Prodigy existed then,\nmany hobbyists ran their own miniature online services called bulletin board\nsystems, or BBSes for short. The Internet existed, but it was not yet widely\nknown outside academic circles.\n\nEnlarge / A photo of a Zoom 2400 BPS modem like I first used in 1992.\n\nJohn Scagon\n\nWhereas the Internet is a huge connected web of systems with billions of\nusers, most BBSes were small hobbyist fiefdoms with a single phone line, and\nonly one person could call in and use it at a time. Although BBS-to-BBS\nmessage networks were common, each system still felt like its own island\nculture with a tin-pot dictator (the system operator\u2014or \"sysop\" for short) who\nlorded over anyone who visited.\n\nNot long after my dad brought home the modem, he handed off a photocopied list\nthat included hundreds of BBS numbers from our 919 area code in North\nCarolina. Back then, the phone company charged significantly for long-distance\ncalls (which could also sneakily include parts of your area code), so we'd be\nsticking to BBSes in our region. This made BBSes a mostly local phenomenon\naround the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / My original Raleigh-area BBS list from 1992, dated December 9, 1991.\n\nBenj Edwards\n\nWith modem in hand, my older brother\u2014about five years older than me\u2014embraced\ncalling BBSes first (we called it \"BBSing\"). He filled up his Procomm Plus\ndialing directory with local favorite BBSes such as The Octopus's Garden, The\nBody Shop, and Chalkboard. Each system gained its own flavor from its sysop,\nwho decorated it with ANSI graphics or special menus and also acted as an\nemcee and moderator for the board's conversations.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nRemembering the best shareware-era DOS games that time forgot\n\nI have a distinct memory of the first time I realized what a BBS was. One day\nwhile I looked over my brother's shoulder, he showed me the file section of\none of those BBSes\u2014a list of available files that you could download to your\nlocal computer. Pages of free-to-download shareware games scrolled by. My eyes\nwidened, and something clicked.\n\n\"You can download games for free?\" I remember thinking. I noticed one file\nlabeled \"RAMPAGE.ZIP\" that was one hundred kilobytes\u2014or \"100K,\" as listed.\nThinking of Rampage on the NES, which was one of my favorite games at the\ntime, I asked my brother to download it. He declined because it would have\ntaken over five minutes to transfer on our 2400 BPS modem. Any file around one\nmegabyte would take about an hour to download.\n\nOnline time was precious back then. Since most BBSes only had one phone line,\nyou didn't want to hog the line for too long or the sysop might boot you. And\nthere was extra jeopardy involved. Since we were using our regular house\ntelephone line to connect, the odds that my mom would pick up and try to dial\nout\u2014thus ruining the transfer process\u2014remained very high. But whatever the\nrisks, the thrill of remote projection by computer sunk into me that day and\nnever left.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n225\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
