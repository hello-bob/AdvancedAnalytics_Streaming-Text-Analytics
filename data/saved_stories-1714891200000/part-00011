Water,\nenergy, and a few essential elements are the prerequisites for cells to\nemerge. However, the exact details of how this happens remain a mystery.\n\nRecent research has focused on trying to recreate in the lab the chemical\nreactions that constitute life as we know it, in conditions plausible for\nearly Earth (around 4 billion years ago). Experiments have grown in\ncomplexity, thanks to technological progress and a better understanding of\nwhat early Earth conditions were like.\n\nHowever, far from bringing scientists together and settling the debate, the\nrise of experimental work has led to many contradictory theories. Some\nscientists think that life emerged in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where the\nconditions provided the necessary energy. Others argue that hot springs on\nland would have provided a better setting because they are more likely to hold\norganic molecules from meteorites. These are just two possibilities which are\nbeing investigated.\n\nHere are five of the most remarkable discoveries over the last five years.\n\n## Reactions in early cells\n\nWhat energy source drove the chemical reactions at the origin of life? This is\nthe mystery that a research team in Germany has sought to unravel. The team\ndelved into the feasibility of 402 reactions known to create some of the\nessential components of life, such as nucleotides (a building block of DNA and\nRNA). They did this using some of the most common elements that could have\nbeen found on the early Earth.\n\nThese reactions, present in modern cells, are also believed to be the core\nmetabolism of LUCA, the last universal common ancestor, a single-cell,\nbacterium-like organism.\n\nFor each reaction, they calculated the changes in free energy, which\ndetermines if a reaction can go forward without other external sources of\nenergy. What is fascinating is that many of these reactions were independent\nof external influences like adenosine triphosphate, a universal source of\nenergy in living cells.\n\nThe synthesis of life's fundamental building blocks didn't need an external\nenergy boost: it was self-sustaining.\n\n## Volcanic glass\n\nLife relies on molecules to store and convey information. Scientists think\nthat RNA (ribonucleic acid) strands were precursors to DNA in fulfilling this\nrole, since their structure is more simple.\n\nThe emergence of RNA on our planet has long confused researchers. However,\nsome progress has been made recently. In 2022, a team of collaborators in the\nUS generated stable RNA strands in the lab. They did it by passing nucleotides\nthrough volcanic glass. The strands they made were long enough to store and\ntransfer information.\n\nVolcanic glass was present on the early Earth, thanks to frequent meteorite\nimpacts coupled with a high volcanic activity. The nucleotides used in the\nstudy are also believed to have been present at that time in Earth's history.\nVolcanic rocks could have facilitated the chemical reactions that assembled\nnucleotides into RNA chains.\n\nHydrothermal vents\n\nCarbon fixation is a process in which CO_2 gains electrons. It is necessary to\nbuild the molecules that form the basis of life.\n\nAn electron donor is necessary to drive this reaction. On the early Earth, H_2\ncould have been the electron donor. In 2020, a team of collaborators showed\nthat this reaction could spontaneously occur and be fueled by environmental\nconditions similar to deep-sea alkaline hydrothermal vents in the early ocean.\nThey did this using microfluidic technology, devices that manipulate tiny\nvolumes of liquids to perform experiments by simulating alkaline vents.\n\nThis pathway is strikingly similar to how many modern bacterial and archaeal\ncells (single-cell organisms without a nucleas) operate.\n\n## The Krebs Cycle\n\nIn modern cells, carbon fixation is followed by a cascade of chemical\nreactions that assemble or break down molecules, in intricate metabolic\nnetworks that are driven by enzymes.\n\nBut scientists are still debating how metabolic reactions unfolded before the\nemergence and evolution of those enzymes. In 2019, a team from the University\nof Strasbourg in France made a breakthrough. They showed that ferrous iron, a\ntype of iron that was abundant in early Earth's crust and ocean, could drive\nnine out of 11 steps of the Krebs Cycle. The Krebs Cycle is a biological\npathway present in many living cells.\n\nHere, ferrous iron acted as the electron donor for carbon fixation, which\ndrove the cascade of reactions. The reactions produced all five of the\nuniversal metabolic precursors\u2014five molecules that are fundamental across\nvarious metabolic pathways in all living organisms.\n\n## Building blocks of ancient cell membranes\n\nUnderstanding the formation of life's building blocks and their intricate\nreactions is a big step forward in comprehending the emergence of life.\n\nHowever, whether they unfolded in hot springs on land or in the deep sea,\nthese reactions would not have gone far without a cell membrane. Cell\nmembranes play an active role in the biochemistry of a primitive cell and its\nconnection with the environment.\n\nModern cell membranes are mostly composed of compounds called phospholipids,\nwhich contain a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails. They are\nstructured in bilayers, with the hydrophilic heads pointing outward and the\nhydrophobic tails pointing inward.\n\nResearch has shown that some components of phospholipids, such as the fatty\nacids that constitute the tails, can self-assemble into those bilayer\nmembranes in a range of environmental conditions. But were these fatty acids\npresent on the early Earth? Recent research from Newcastle University, UK\ngives an interesting answer. Researchers recreated the spontaneous formation\nof these molecules by combining H2-rich fluids, likely present in ancient\nalkaline hydrothermal vents, with CO_2-rich water resembling the early ocean.\n\nThis breakthrough aligns with the hypothesis that stable fatty acid membranes\ncould have originated in alkaline hydrothermal vents, potentially progressing\ninto living cells. The authors speculated that similar chemical reactions\nmight unfold in the subsurface oceans of icy moons, which are thought to have\nhydrothermal vents similar to terrestrial ones.\n\nEach of these discoveries adds a new piece to the puzzle of the origin of\nlife. Regardless of which ones are proved correct, contrasting theories are\nfueling the search for answers.\n\nAs Charles Darwin wrote: \"False facts are highly injurious to the progress of\nscience for they often long endure: but false views, if supported by some\nevidence, do little harm, for everyone takes a salutary pleasure in proving\ntheir falseness; and when this is done, one path towards error is closed and\nthe road to truth is often at the same time opened.\"\n\nProvided by The Conversation\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons\nlicense.
