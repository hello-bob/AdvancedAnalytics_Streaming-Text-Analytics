We track 'late-career'\n> scientists (N=324,463) in 16 STEMM disciplines (science, technology,\n> engineering, mathematics, and medicine) from 38 OECD countries for up to\n> five decades. We examine the details of their mobility patterns between the\n> top, middle, and bottom productivity classes. Methodologically, we turn a\n> large-scale publication and citation bibliometric dataset into a\n> comprehensive, longitudinal data source for research on careers in science.\n> The global science system emerges as highly immobile: 60% of global top\n> performers continue their careers as top performers and half of global\n> bottom performers as bottom performers. Jumpers-Up and Droppers-Down are\n> extremely rare in science. Our regression analyses show that productivity is\n> highly path dependent: for all disciplines examined, there is a single most\n> important predictor of being a top performer: being a top performer at an\n> earlier career stage.\n\nComments:| 31 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables plus Electronic Supplementary\nMaterials  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Digital Libraries (cs.DL)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.16835 [cs.DL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.16835v1 [cs.DL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16835arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Marek Kwiek [view email] [v1] Fri, 19 Jan 2024 07:21:13 UTC (3,180 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Quantifying Lifetime Productivity Changes: A\nLongitudinal Study of 325,000 Late-Career Scientists, by Marek Kwiek and\nLukasz Szymula\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.DL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
