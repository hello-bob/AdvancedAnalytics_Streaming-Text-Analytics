Person A and Person B building the\nsame source code should get the exact same binary package resulting from it.\n\nReproducible builds are important to mitigate what\u2019s known today as \u201csupply-\nchain attacks\u201d; attacks that are not directly aimed at the target system but\nrather at a sub-software, library or dependency that is part of that system.\n\nJust because you read the source code for an open source software on GitHub it\ndoesn\u2019t mean that the binary package you download and install on your\noperating system is 100% originating from that source code. A middleman in the\nbuild phase could interfere with that package sometimes without anyone\nknowing, and add malicious codes or scripts to user systems.\n\nMany years ago, mainstream Linux distributions started the effort of making\nall of their packages marked as reproducible builds. That is, anyone who\nbuilds the source code for any package in their distribution will get the\nexact same binary package from that source code, allowing independent\nverifiers and auditors to make sure the supply chain is safe and secure.\nToday, most Linux distributions stand at above a 90% rate for reproducible\nbuilds, and you can track their progress from this website:\n\nreproducible-builds.org\n\nreproducible-builds.org\n\nA few days ago some researchers from the \u201cLucerne University of Applied\nSciences and Arts\u201d in Switzerland published a research paper detailing how\nmuch of Arch Linux packages are actually reproducible according to their own\nindependent tests:\n\ndl.gi.de\n\ndl.gi.de\n\nThe summary they have found is that around 89% of Arch Linux packages are\nreproducible, while the remaining 11% is not. They have set up an online\nservice for continuously building Arch Linux packages and displaying the\nresults of reproducible builds rate:\n\nreproducible.crypto-lab.ch\n\nreproducible.crypto-lab.ch\n\nAs an additional effort, the researchers selected 16 unreproducible packages\nthat belong to the Certbot program from the Let\u2019s Encrypt project; a bot that\ngenerates HTTPS certificates for free for any web server, and reported the\nissues with them to the upstream so that they get fixed.\n\nAdditionally, they have found that a package belonging to the fwupd project is\nnot reproducible. fwupd is an open-source firmware distribution mechanism that\nis included by default in most Linux distributions, and is currently part of\nthe Linux Foundation. They have submitted a PR to the upstream to fix the\nissue.\n\nThus, with the exception of the packages mentioned earlier, around 89% of Arch\nLinux packages are currently reproducible according to these independent\nverifiers. There is still a journey and a lot of time to hit the 100% mark\napparently, but the open source community is closely getting to that target.\n\nLoading...\n\nSomething went wrong while trying to load the full version of this site.
