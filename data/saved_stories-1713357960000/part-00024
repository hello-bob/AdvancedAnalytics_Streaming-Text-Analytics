A video taken by one of the protesters and\nshared with The Washington Post shows New York Police Department officers walk\ninto the Google office and calmly tell protesters that they will be arrested\nif they don\u2019t leave. When the workers refuse, the police ask them to turn\naround and put their hands behind their backs.\n\n\u201cPhysically impeding other employees\u2019 work and preventing them from accessing\nour facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and we will investigate\nand take action,\u201d said Bailey Tomson, a Google spokesperson. \u201cThese employees\nwere put on administrative leave, and their access to our systems was cut.\nAfter refusing multiple requests to leave the premises, law enforcement was\nengaged to remove them to ensure office safety.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nProtesters entered the offices in New York and California around 2 p.m.\nEastern time, vowing to stay there until the company met their demand that\nGoogle pull out of a $1.2 billion contract it shares with Amazon to provide\ncloud services and data centers to the Israeli government. Other protesters\nrallied outside the company\u2019s offices in New York, Sunnyvale and Seattle.\n\nSome workers and outside activists have opposed the contract, known as Nimbus,\nsince it was signed in 2021. But protests have ramped up over the past seven\nmonths as Israeli forces continue to bombard the Gaza Strip, following Hamas\u2019s\nOct. 7 cross-border attack on Israel. Workers have circulated internal emails,\nprotested outside company offices and staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d outside one of\nGoogle\u2019s buildings in San Francisco in December, blocking traffic on a busy\ndowntown street.\n\nThe protests were staged a day after pro-Palestinian activists blocked\nhighways, bridges and the entrances to airports across the United States in\ncoordinated demonstrations against Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza and U.S. military\nsupport for the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn early March, Google fired a worker who stood up and protested during a\nspeech by Google\u2019s top executive in Israel at a conference in New York. Zelda\nMontes, a software engineer at Google-owned YouTube who was one of the workers\nparticipating in the sit-in, acknowledged in an interview before the protest\nthat they may be fired, too.\n\n\u201cWe often have the privilege of looking the other way and not to have to think\nabout the impact of our work on the world,\u201d Montes said. \u201cI have been waiting\nfor months for people to be in the same position as me and be ready to put\ntheir job on the line.\u201d Montes did not respond to text messages requesting\ncomment after the arrests.\n\nThe contract that the workers are protesting was signed with the Israeli\ngovernment as a whole. But when it was initially signed, Israeli officials\ntold reporters that the terms of the deal prohibit Google and Amazon from\ndenying services to specific parts of the government, raising concerns among\nsome tech employees that their work could be used for military purposes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nLast week, Time Magazine reported that Google has been negotiating with\nIsrael\u2019s Defense Ministry in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deplorable that Google has been selling this technology to the Israeli\ngovernment and military and lying to its employees about it,\u201d Montes said,\nreferring to the Time Magazine report.\n\nAmazon employees involved in anti-Nimbus organizing also attended rallies on\nTuesday, organizers said. Employees who oppose the contract with Israel have\nbeen clashing with their Tel Aviv-based co-workers since the conflict began in\nOctober, The Washington Post has previously reported.\n\nAt an Amazon shareholder meeting in May, anti-Nimbus Amazon employees said\nthey will support a resolution requesting a third-party investigative report\non whether \u201ccustomers\u2019 use of its products and services with surveillance,\ncomputer vision, or cloud storage capabilities contributes to human rights\nviolations or violates international humanitarian law.\u201d\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTechnology\n\nBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devices\n\nAnalysis|Chatbots\u2019 flaws aren\u2019t stopping tech giants from putting them\neverywhere\n\nWhat\u2019s with all the black-and-white logos for apps?\n\nU.S. gives Samsung $6.4 billion to build chip factories in Texas\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": true}
