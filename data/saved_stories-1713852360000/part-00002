The\nprotection scheme was exposed in 2022 when Russian authorities arrested six\nmembers of the group, which sold millions of stolen payment cards at flashy\nonline shops like Trump\u2019s Dumps.\n\nA now-defunct carding shop that sold stolen credit cards and invoked 45\u2019s\nlikeness and name.\n\nAs reported by The Record, a Russian court last week sentenced former FSB\nofficer Grigory Tsaregorodtsev for taking a $1.7 million bribe from a\ncybercriminal group that was seeking a \u201croof,\u201d a well-placed, corrupt law\nenforcement official who could be counted on to both disregard their illegal\nhacking activities and run interference with authorities in the event of their\narrest.\n\nTsaregorodtsev was head of the counterintelligence department for a division\nof the FSB based in Perm, Russia. In February 2022, Russian authorities\narrested six men in the Perm region accused of selling stolen payment card\ndata. They also seized multiple carding shops run by the gang, including Ferum\nShop, Sky-Fraud, and Trump\u2019s Dumps, a popular fraud store that invoked the\n45th president\u2019s likeness and promised to \u201cmake credit card fraud great\nagain.\u201d\n\nAll of the domains seized in that raid were registered by an IT consulting\ncompany in Perm called Get-net LLC, which was owned in part by Artem Zaitsev \u2014\none of the six men arrested. Zaitsev reportedly was a well-known programmer\nwhose company supplied services and leasing to the local FSB field office.\n\nThe message for Trump\u2019s Dumps users left behind by Russian authorities that\nseized the domain in 2022.\n\nRussian news sites report that Internal Affairs officials with the FSB grew\nsuspicious when Tsaregorodtsev became a little too interested in the case\nfollowing the hacking group\u2019s arrests. The former FSB agent had reportedly\nassured the hackers he could have their case transferred and that they would\nsoon be free.\n\nBut when that promised freedom didn\u2019t materialize, four the of the defendants\npulled the walls down on the scheme and brought down their own roof. The FSB\narrested Tsaregorodtsev, and seized $154,000 in cash, 100 gold bars, real\nestate and expensive cars.\n\nAt Tsaregorodtsev\u2019s trial, his lawyers argued that their client wasn\u2019t guilty\nof bribery per se, but that he did admit to fraud because he was ultimately\nunable to fully perform the services for which he\u2019d been hired.\n\nThe Russian news outlet Kommersant reports that all four of those who\ncooperated were released with probation or correctional labor. Zaitsev\nreceived a sentence of 3.5 years in prison, and defendant Alexander Kovalev\ngot four years.\n\nIn 2017, KrebsOnSecurity profiled Trump\u2019s Dumps, and found the contact address\nlisted on the site was tied to an email address used to register more than a\ndozen domains that were made to look like legitimate Javascript calls many\ne-commerce sites routinely make to process transactions \u2014 such as \u201cjs-\nlink[dot]su,\u201d \u201cjs-stat[dot]su,\u201d and \u201cjs-mod[dot]su.\u201d\n\nSearching on those malicious domains revealed a 2016 report from RiskIQ, which\nshows the domains featured prominently in a series of hacking campaigns\nagainst e-commerce websites. According to RiskIQ, the attacks targeted online\nstores running outdated and unpatched versions of shopping cart software from\nMagento, Powerfront and OpenCart.\n\nThose shopping cart flaws allowed the crooks to install \u201cweb skimmers,\u201d\nmalicious Javascript used to steal credit card details and other information\nfrom payment forms on the checkout pages of vulnerable e-commerce sites. The\nstolen customer payment card details were then sold on sites like Trump\u2019s\nDumps and Sky-Fraud.\n\nThis entry was posted on Monday 22nd of April 2024 04:07 PM\n\nA Little Sunshine Ne'er-Do-Well News Web Fraud 2.0\n\nAlexander Kovalev Artem Zaitsev Federal Security Service (FSB) Ferum Shop Get-\nNet LLC Grigory Tsaregorodtsev Sky-Fraud Trump's-Dumps\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMailing List\n\nSubscribe here\n\nSearch KrebsOnSecurity\n\nRecent Posts\n\n  * Russian FSB Counterintelligence Chief Gets 9 Years in Cybercrime Bribery Scheme\n  * Who Stole 3.6M Tax Records from South Carolina?\n  * Crickets from Chirp Systems in Smart Lock Key Leak\n  * Why CISA is Warning CISOs About a Breach at Sisense\n  * Twitter\u2019s Clumsy Pivot to X.com Is a Gift to Phishers\n\nStory Categories\n\n  * A Little Sunshine\n  * All About Skimmers\n  * Ashley Madison breach\n  * Breadcrumbs\n  * Data Breaches\n  * DDoS-for-Hire\n  * Employment Fraud\n  * How to Break Into Security\n  * Internet of Things (IoT)\n  * Latest Warnings\n  * Ne'er-Do-Well News\n  * Other\n  * Pharma Wars\n  * Ransomware\n  * Russia's War on Ukraine\n  * Security Tools\n  * SIM Swapping\n  * Spam Nation\n  * Target: Small Businesses\n  * Tax Refund Fraud\n  * The Coming Storm\n  * Time to Patch\n  * Web Fraud 2.0\n\nWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia\n\n\u00a9 Krebs on Security - Mastodon\n\n", "frontpage": true}
