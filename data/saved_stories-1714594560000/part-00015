Around six-in-ten U.S. adults\n(58%) hold that view today, up from 47% at the beginning of Joe Biden\u2019s\npresidency in 2021.\n\nHow we did this\n\nWe conducted this analysis to learn more about U.S. crime patterns and how\nthose patterns have changed over time.\n\nThe analysis relies on statistics published by the FBI, which we accessed\nthrough the Crime Data Explorer, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS),\nwhich we accessed through the National Crime Victimization Survey data\nanalysis tool.\n\nTo measure public attitudes about crime in the U.S., we relied on survey data\nfrom Pew Research Center and Gallup.\n\nAdditional details about each data source, including survey methodologies, are\navailable by following the links in the text of this analysis.\n\nWith the issue likely to come up in this year\u2019s presidential election, here\u2019s\nwhat we know about crime in the United States, based on the latest available\ndata from the federal government and other sources.\n\n#### How much crime is there in the U.S.?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say for certain. The two primary sources of government crime\nstatistics \u2013 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of\nJustice Statistics (BJS) \u2013 paint an incomplete picture.\n\nThe FBI publishes annual data on crimes that have been reported to law\nenforcement, but not crimes that haven\u2019t been reported. Historically, the FBI\nhas also only published statistics about a handful of specific violent and\nproperty crimes, but not many other types of crime, such as drug crime. And\nwhile the FBI\u2019s data is based on information from thousands of federal, state,\ncounty, city and other police departments, not all law enforcement agencies\nparticipate every year. In 2022, the most recent full year with available\nstatistics, the FBI received data from 83% of participating agencies.\n\nBJS, for its part, tracks crime by fielding a large annual survey of Americans\nages 12 and older and asking them whether they were the victim of certain\ntypes of crime in the past six months. One advantage of this approach is that\nit captures both reported and unreported crimes. But the BJS survey has\nlimitations of its own. Like the FBI, it focuses mainly on a handful of\nviolent and property crimes. And since the BJS data is based on after-the-fact\ninterviews with crime victims, it cannot provide information about one\nespecially high-profile type of offense: murder.\n\nAll those caveats aside, looking at the FBI and BJS statistics side-by-side\ndoes give researchers a good picture of U.S. violent and property crime rates\nand how they have changed over time. In addition, the FBI is transitioning to\na new data collection system \u2013 known as the National Incident-Based Reporting\nSystem \u2013 that eventually will provide national information on a much larger\nset of crimes, as well as details such as the time and place they occur and\nthe types of weapons involved, if applicable.\n\n#### Which kinds of crime are most and least common?\n\nProperty crime in the U.S. is much more common than violent crime. In 2022,\nthe FBI reported a total of 1,954.4 property crimes per 100,000 people,\ncompared with 380.7 violent crimes per 100,000 people.\n\nBy far the most common form of property crime in 2022 was larceny/theft,\nfollowed by motor vehicle theft and burglary. Among violent crimes, aggravated\nassault was the most common offense, followed by robbery, rape, and\nmurder/nonnegligent manslaughter.\n\nBJS tracks a slightly different set of offenses from the FBI, but it finds the\nsame overall patterns, with theft the most common form of property crime in\n2022 and assault the most common form of violent crime.\n\n#### How have crime rates in the U.S. changed over time?\n\nBoth the FBI and BJS data show dramatic declines in U.S. violent and property\ncrime rates since the early 1990s, when crime spiked across much of the\nnation.\n\nUsing the FBI data, the violent crime rate fell 49% between 1993 and 2022,\nwith large decreases in the rates of robbery (-74%), aggravated assault (-39%)\nand murder/nonnegligent manslaughter (-34%). It\u2019s not possible to calculate\nthe change in the rape rate during this period because the FBI revised its\ndefinition of the offense in 2013.\n\nThe FBI data also shows a 59% reduction in the U.S. property crime rate\nbetween 1993 and 2022, with big declines in the rates of burglary (-75%),\nlarceny/theft (-54%) and motor vehicle theft (-53%).\n\nUsing the BJS statistics, the declines in the violent and property crime rates\nare even steeper than those captured in the FBI data. Per BJS, the U.S.\nviolent and property crime rates each fell 71% between 1993 and 2022.\n\nWhile crime rates have fallen sharply over the long term, the decline hasn\u2019t\nalways been steady. There have been notable increases in certain kinds of\ncrime in some years, including recently.\n\nIn 2020, for example, the U.S. murder rate saw its largest single-year\nincrease on record \u2013 and by 2022, it remained considerably higher than before\nthe coronavirus pandemic. Preliminary data for 2023, however, suggests that\nthe murder rate fell substantially last year.\n\n#### How do Americans perceive crime in their country?\n\nAmericans tend to believe crime is up, even when official data shows it is\ndown.\n\nIn 23 of 27 Gallup surveys conducted since 1993, at least 60% of U.S. adults\nhave said there is more crime nationally than there was the year before,\ndespite the downward trend in crime rates during most of that period.\n\nWhile perceptions of rising crime at the national level are common, fewer\nAmericans believe crime is up in their own communities. In every Gallup crime\nsurvey since the 1990s, Americans have been much less likely to say crime is\nup in their area than to say the same about crime nationally.\n\nPublic attitudes about crime differ widely by Americans\u2019 party affiliation,\nrace and ethnicity, and other factors. For example, Republicans and\nRepublican-leaning independents are much more likely than Democrats and\nDemocratic leaners to say reducing crime should be a top priority for the\npresident and Congress this year (68% vs. 47%), according to a recent Pew\nResearch Center survey.\n\n#### How does crime in the U.S. differ by demographic characteristics?\n\nSome groups of Americans are more likely than others to be victims of crime.\nIn the 2022 BJS survey, for example, younger people and those with lower\nincomes were far more likely to report being the victim of a violent crime\nthan older and higher-income people.\n\nThere were no major differences in violent crime victimization rates between\nmale and female respondents or between those who identified as White, Black or\nHispanic. But the victimization rate among Asian Americans (a category that\nincludes Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders) was substantially lower\nthan among other racial and ethnic groups.\n\nThe same BJS survey asks victims about the demographic characteristics of the\noffenders in the incidents they experienced.\n\nIn 2022, those who are male, younger people and those who are Black accounted\nfor considerably larger shares of perceived offenders in violent incidents\nthan their respective shares of the U.S. population. Men, for instance,\naccounted for 79% of perceived offenders in violent incidents, compared with\n49% of the nation\u2019s 12-and-older population that year. Black Americans\naccounted for 25% of perceived offenders in violent incidents, about twice\ntheir share of the 12-and-older population (12%).\n\nAs with all surveys, however, there are several potential sources of error,\nincluding the possibility that crime victims\u2019 perceptions about offenders are\nincorrect.\n\n#### How does crime in the U.S. differ geographically?\n\nThere are big geographic differences in violent and property crime rates.\n\nFor example, in 2022, there were more than 700 violent crimes per 100,000\nresidents in New Mexico and Alaska. That compares with fewer than 200 per\n100,000 people in Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine,\naccording to the FBI.\n\nThe FBI notes that various factors might influence an area\u2019s crime rate,\nincluding its population density and economic conditions.\n\n#### What percentage of crimes are reported to police? What percentage are\nsolved?\n\nMost violent and property crimes in the U.S. are not reported to police, and\nmost of the crimes that are reported are not solved.\n\nIn its annual survey, BJS asks crime victims whether they reported their crime\nto police. It found that in 2022, only 41.5% of violent crimes and 31.8% of\nhousehold property crimes were reported to authorities. BJS notes that there\nare many reasons why crime might not be reported, including fear of reprisal\nor of \u201cgetting the offender in trouble,\u201d a feeling that police \u201cwould not or\ncould not do anything to help,\u201d or a belief that the crime is \u201ca personal\nissue or too trivial to report.\u201d\n\nMost of the crimes that are reported to police, meanwhile, are not solved, at\nleast based on an FBI measure known as the clearance rate. That\u2019s the share of\ncases each year that are closed, or \u201ccleared,\u201d through the arrest, charging\nand referral of a suspect for prosecution, or due to \u201cexceptional\u201d\ncircumstances such as the death of a suspect or a victim\u2019s refusal to\ncooperate with a prosecution. In 2022, police nationwide cleared 36.7% of\nviolent crimes that were reported to them and 12.1% of the property crimes\nthat came to their attention.\n\n#### Which crimes are most likely to be reported to police? Which are most\nlikely to be solved?\n\nAround eight-in-ten motor vehicle thefts (80.9%) were reported to police in\n2022, making them by far the most commonly reported property crime tracked by\nBJS. Household burglaries and trespassing offenses were reported to police at\nmuch lower rates (44.9% and 41.2%, respectively), while personal theft/larceny\nand other types of theft were only reported around a quarter of the time.\n\nAmong violent crimes \u2013 excluding homicide, which BJS doesn\u2019t track \u2013 robbery\nwas the most likely to be reported to law enforcement in 2022 (64.0%). It was\nfollowed by aggravated assault (49.9%), simple assault (36.8%) and rape/sexual\nassault (21.4%).\n\nThe list of crimes cleared by police in 2022 looks different from the list of\ncrimes reported. Law enforcement officers were generally much more likely to\nsolve violent crimes than property crimes, according to the FBI.\n\nThe most frequently solved violent crime tends to be homicide. Police cleared\naround half of murders and nonnegligent manslaughters (52.3%) in 2022. The\nclearance rates were lower for aggravated assault (41.4%), rape (26.1%) and\nrobbery (23.2%).\n\nWhen it comes to property crime, law enforcement agencies cleared 13.0% of\nburglaries, 12.4% of larcenies/thefts and 9.3% of motor vehicle thefts in\n2022.\n\n#### Are police solving more or fewer crimes than they used to?\n\nNationwide clearance rates for both violent and property crime are at their\nlowest levels since at least 1993, the FBI data shows.\n\nPolice cleared a little over a third (36.7%) of the violent crimes that came\nto their attention in 2022, down from nearly half (48.1%) as recently as 2013.\nDuring the same period, there were decreases for each of the four types of\nviolent crime the FBI tracks:\n\n  * Police cleared 52.3% of reported murders and nonnegligent homicides in 2022, down from 64.1% in 2013.\n  * They cleared 41.4% of aggravated assaults, down from 57.7%.\n  * They cleared 26.1% of rapes, down from 40.6%.\n  * They cleared 23.2% of robberies, down from 29.4%.\n\nThe pattern is less pronounced for property crime. Overall, law enforcement\nagencies cleared 12.1% of reported property crimes in 2022, down from 19.7% in\n2013. The clearance rate for burglary didn\u2019t change much, but it fell for\nlarceny/theft (to 12.4% in 2022 from 22.4% in 2013) and motor vehicle theft\n(to 9.3% from 14.2%).\n\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published on Nov. 20, 2020.\n\nTopics\n\n  * Criminal Justice\n  * Police\n  * Police\n\nShare This Link:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * Threads\n  * LinkedIn\n  * WhatsApp\n\nShare\n\nJohn Gramlich is an associate director at Pew Research Center\n\n### Related\n\nshort readJul 12, 2023\n\n## 8 facts about Black Lives Matter\n\nreportJun 29, 2023\n\n## #BlackLivesMatter Turns 10\n\nreportJun 14, 2023\n\n## Support for the Black Lives Matter Movement Has Dropped Considerably From\nIts Peak in 2020\n\nshort readJun 14, 2023\n\n## Fewer than 1% of federal criminal defendants were acquitted in 2022\n\nshort readFeb 3, 2023\n\n## Before release of video showing Tyre Nichols\u2019 beating, public views of\npolice conduct had improved modestly\n\n### TOPICS\n\n  * Criminal Justice\n  * Police\n  * Police\n\n### Most Popular\n\n1\n\nVoters\u2019 views of Trump and Biden differ sharply by religion\n\n2\n\nA growing share of Americans have little or no confidence in Netanyahu\n\n3\n\nIn Tight Presidential Race, Voters Are Broadly Critical of Both Biden and\nTrump\n\n4\n\nYounger Americans stand out in their views of the Israel-Hamas war\n\n5\n\nAmericans\u2019 Views of Technology Companies\n\n1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20036 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\n#### Research Topics\n\n  * Age & Generations\n  * Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n  * Economy & Work\n  * Family & Relationships\n  * Gender & LGBTQ\n  * Immigration & Migration\n  * International Affairs\n  * Internet & Technology\n  * Methodological Research\n  * News Habits & Media\n  * Non-U.S. Governments\n  * Other Topics\n  * Politics & Policy\n  * Race & Ethnicity\n  * Religion\n  * Science\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n  * Email Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Tumblr\n  * YouTube\n  * RSS Feed\n\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that\ninforms the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.\nIt conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, media content\nanalysis and other empirical social science research.
