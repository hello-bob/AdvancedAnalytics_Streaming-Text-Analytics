Between 21 April and 4 May 2018, the motto was removed from the code\nof conduct's preface and retained in its last sentence.^[6]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe motto was first suggested either by Google employee Paul Buchheit at a\nmeeting about corporate values that took place in early 2000^[7] or in\n2001^[8] or, according to another account, by Google engineer Amit Patel in\n1999.^[9] Buchheit, the creator of Gmail, said he \"wanted something that, once\nyou put it in there, would be hard to take out\", adding that the slogan was\n\"also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies, especially our\ncompetitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the\nusers to some extent\".^[7]\n\nWhile the official corporate philosophy of Google^[10] does not contain the\nwords \"Don't be evil\", they were included in the prospectus (on Form S-1) of\nGoogle's 2004 IPO (a letter from Google's founders, later called the \"'Don't\nBe Evil' manifesto\"): \"Don't be evil. We believe strongly that in the long\nterm, we will be better served\u2014as shareholders and in all other ways\u2014by a\ncompany that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term\ngains.\"^[11] The motto is sometimes incorrectly stated as Do no evil.^[8]^[12]\n\nBy early 2018, the motto was still cited in the preface to Google's Code of\nConduct:\n\n> \"Don't be evil.\" Googlers generally apply those words to how we serve our\n> users. But \"Don't be evil\" is much more than that...\n>\n> The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put \"Don't be evil\" into\n> practice...^[6]\n\nBetween 21 April and 4 May 2018, Google removed the motto from the preface,\nleaving a mention in the final line: \"And remember... don't be evil, and if\nyou see something that you think isn't right \u2013 speak up!\"^[6]^[13]\n\n## Interpretations[edit]\n\nIn their 2004 founders' letter^[14] prior to their initial public offering,\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin argued that their \"Don't be evil\" culture\nprohibited conflicts of interest, and required objectivity and an absence of\nbias:\n\n> Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions:\n> medical, financial and many others. Our search results are the best we know\n> how to produce. They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept\n> payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updating. We also display\n> advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly.\n> This is similar to a well-run newspaper, where the advertisements are clear\n> and the articles are not influenced by the advertisers\u2019 payments. We believe\n> it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and\n> research, not only to the information people pay for you to see.\n\nIn 2009, Chris Hoofnagle, director of University of California, Berkeley Law's\ninformation privacy programs, stated that Google's original intention\nexpressed by the \"don't be evil\" motto was linked to the company's separation\nof search results from advertising.^[15] However, he observed that clearly\nseparating search results from sponsored links is required by law, thus,\nGoogle's practice had since become mainstream and was no longer remarkable or\ngood. Hoofnagle argued that Google should abandon the motto because:\n\n> The evil talk is not only an albatross for Google, it obscures the\n> substantial consumer benefits from Google\u2019s advertising model. Because we\n> have forgotten the original context of Google\u2019s evil representations, the\n> company should remind the public of the company\u2019s contribution to a\n> revolution in search advertising, and highlight some overlooked benefits of\n> their model.\n\nIn a 2013 NPR interview, Eric Schmidt revealed that when Larry Page and Sergey\nBrin recommended the motto as a guiding principle for Google, he \"thought this\nwas the stupidest rule ever\", but then changed his opinion after a meeting\nwhere an engineer successfully referred to the motto when expressing concerns\nabout a planned advertising product, which was eventually cancelled.^[16]\nJournalists have raised questions about the actual definition of what Google\nconsidered \"evil\".^[17]^[18] On the user-facing 'What We Believe' page, Google\nappeared to replace the original motto altogether (a carefully reworded\nversion stood as of 10 April 2015, \"You can make money without doing\nevil\",^[10] which varied significantly from the absolute imperative of DON'T\nbe evil).\n\n## Use in criticism of Google[edit]\n\nCritics of Google frequently spin the motto in a negative way, such as\nInfoWorld's 2014 article \"Google? Evil? You have no idea\".^[19]^[20]^[21]^[22]\nGoogle's 2012 announcement to \"begin tracking users universally across all its\nservices\" (via \"Google Plus\" accounts) resulted in public backlash on the\nmotto, like \"Google's Broken Promise: The End of 'Don't Be Evil'\" on\nGizmodo.^[23]^[24]^[25] In the same year, major social networks even co-\ndeveloped a Don't be evil browser bookmarklet (specifically to expose alleged\nSERP manipulation promoting Google-owned content over that of others).^[26]\n\nOn 16 May 2013, Margaret Hodge MP, the chair of the United Kingdom Public\nAccounts Committee, accused Google of being \"calculated and unethical\" over\nits use of highly contrived and artificial distinctions to avoid paying\nbillions of pounds in corporation tax owed by its UK operations.^[27] The\ncompany was accused by the committee, which represents the interests of all UK\ntaxpayers, of being \"evil\" for not paying its \"fair amount of tax\". She told\nMatt Brittin, head of Google UK, \"I think that you do evil\".^[28] In 2015, the\nUK Government introduced a new law intended to penalise Google and other large\nmultinational corporations' artificial tax avoidance.^[29]\n\nIn 2015, The Commercial Appeal reported that \"critics say Google's recent\nmoves belie search giant's motto\".^[30]\n\n## Lawsuit[edit]\n\nOn 29 November 2021, three former Google employees filed a lawsuit alleging\nthat Google's motto \"Don't be evil\" amounts to a contractual obligation that\nthe tech giant violated, that Google broke their own moral code by firing them\nas retaliation for their efforts against \"evil\", in what the trio thought were\nin accordance with the principle, in drawing attention to and organizing\nemployees against controversial projects, such as work for the U.S. Customs\nand Border Protection (CBP) during the Trump administration which, as they\nclaimed, amounted to \"doing evil\", and as such deserve monetary damages.^[31]\n\nThe plaintiffs' lawyer, Laurie Burgess, says Google employees can be fired for\nnot abiding by the motto.^[31]\n\n> There are all sorts of contract terms that a jury is required to interpret:\n> \"don't be evil\" is not so \"out there\" as to be unenforceable. \"Since\n> Google's contract tells employees that they can be fired for failing to\n> abide by the motto, 'don't be evil,' it must have meaning.\" - plaintiffs'\n> lawyer, Laurie Burgess^[31]\n\nThe trio circulated a petition calling on Google to publicly commit to not\nworking with the CBP. The three workers, along with a fourth, were later\nfired, in 2019, on a denied accusation, of \"clear and repeated violations\" of\nthe company's data security policies.^[31]\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board wrote, in May 2021, that Google \"arguably\nviolated\" federal labor law by \"unlawfully discharging\" the workers.^[31]\n\nThe trio condemned Google for their behavior in 2021:\n\n> Google realized that \"don't be evil\" was both costing it money and driving\n> workers to organize. Rather than admit that their stance had changed and\n> lose the accompanying benefits to the company image, Google fired employees\n> who were living the motto.^[31]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Censorship by Google\n  * Criticism of Google\n  * Ethical code\n  * Evil corporation\n  * Friendly artificial intelligence\n  * Googlization\n  * List of mottos\n  * Surveillance capitalism\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Lawler, Richard (2 October 2015). \"Alphabet replaces Google's 'Don't be evil' with 'Do the right thing\".
