I spent most of 2023\nwriting my bachelor\u2019s thesis and finishing up my degree. That\u2019s all wrapped up\nnow though, which means I\u2019ve finally had time to wrap up some other things for\nmy open source projects.\n\n## River 0.3.0\n\nThe river 0.3.0 release has finally been tagged! This one\u2019s been in the\npipeline for quite a while, it\u2019s been over a year since 0.2.0 was released and\nriver has seen significant improvements since then. The past few months I\u2019ve\ndone my best to fix as many bugs as possible but a non-bugfix release always\nentails new code reaching a lot of people with diverse setups. If you find a\nbug in river please open an issue.\n\nThe biggest change in river 0.3.0 is not immediately visible: river 0.3.0 uses\nthe wlroots scene graph API and has see a lot of internal improvements related\nto that transition. An initial version of the wlroots scene graph API was\nlanded in wlroots over two years ago and has seen steady improvement since. I\nhelped to push it forward in upstream wlroots over the years and am very happy\nto finally be using it in river. It brings finely-grained damage tracking and\nother performance optimizations to river which should positively impact\nbattery life and make running river with software rendering bearable.\n\nAside from that more behind-the-scenes work, river 0.3.0 brings many nice\nusability enhancements. There is now a \u201crules system\u201d for automatically\nassigning tags to new windows and performing other actions. The input-\nmethod-v2 and text-input-v3 protocols are supported, allowing use of\nalternative input software for users that speak a language not well supported\nby western keyboards. River also now has basic support for drawing tablet\ninput. For a full list of changes, see the release notes here\n\nThank you to everyone who has contributed code and bug reports to river! River\nwould not be where it is today without you.\n\nIn other river news, the upstream river repository has moved to\nhttps://codeberg.org/river/river. Github is a proprietary platform with\ninterests increasingly misaligned with my values. Free and open source\nsoftware like river should not require contributors to have a github account\nor interact with github in any way. There is still a read-only mirror of the\nriver repository on github for now to ease the transition, it may be dropped\neventually if/when I decide to delete my personal github account.\n\nRiver also now has a page here on my website, I\u2019ve written a bit about my\nfuture plans for river there if you\u2019re curious :) River also has gained a\nwritten Code of Conduct documenting the existing standards and moderation\npractice. Luckily, we have a wonderful community and haven\u2019t yet had to deal\nwith any notable unacceptable behavior I\u2019m aware of.\n\n## Waylock 1.0.0\n\nThere haven\u2019t been any breaking changes to waylock in over a year and I\u2019m\nhappy with its feature set. Therefore, I\u2019ve tagged a stable 1.0 release. The\nonly change since the last waylock release is the addition of the -ready-fd\nflag contributed by tiosgz. This is an alternative to the -fork-on-lock flag\nfor notification that waylock has successfully locked the session. The new\nflag is compatible with the readiness notification protocol used by the s6 and\ndinit service managers as well as being more flexible than -fork-on-lock for\nuse in scripting.\n\nDon\u2019t be alarmed if waylock development slows down to a snail\u2019s pace after\nthis release. I consider it to be feature complete and as long as there are no\nbugs found there is little reason to make changes. I will of course continue\nto update it to be compatible with new Zig releases as needed.\n\n## Website Rewrite\n\nYou may have noticed that my website looks a bit different than it used to and\nhas a few new pages. I\u2019d been wanting to add some new pages for a while but\nhad entirely forgotten how to use hugo. Since I didn\u2019t like hugo very much in\npractice anyways, I decided to switch to something more transparent and chose\nBagatto. It has been lovely to work with and I\u2019m much more confident that I\u2019ll\nremember how to modify and extend my website years from now. Source code here\nfor the curious. This was also my first time using Janet (or any lispy\nlanguage) for anything \u201creal\u201d and I found the experience very pleasant.\n\n## Donate\n\nIf my work on river and waylock adds value to your life and you\u2019d like to\nsupport me financially you can find donation information here.\n\n\u00a9 2021-2024 Isaac Freund, Content CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, Source Code AGPL-3.0-only\n\n", "frontpage": true}
