Here is a\nquick-and-dirty guide to recognizing these mind-warping weapons in the wild.\n\nAs I discovered while researching my new book Stories Are Weapons,\npsychological warfare became a professional industry in the early twentieth\ncentury, modeled in part on the new field of public relations. The basic\nstructure of an American psyop is cobbled together out of advertising\ntechniques, pop psychology, and pulp fiction tropes. Using insights gleaned\nfrom these sources, the military spent the early years of the 20th century\nfiguring out how to craft messages that can hurt, demoralize, and distract\nyou.\n\nThen something terrible but predictable happened. Just as military equipment\nwas transferred to civilian police forces during the 1990s, psyops found their\nway into the arsenals of culture warriors today.\n\nUnlike bombs, however, psyops can be dodged. Once you know what to look for,\nyour brain can treat this cultural ordinance exactly the way your spam filter\ntreats e-mails about CrYpT0 InVeStMeNt$ \u2013 it will throw them in your mental\ntrashcan unread, so that you can focus on constructive information.\n\nSo, how do you distinguish between a psyop \u2013 a weaponized story \u2013 from other\nkinds of communication? Walk with me through these three simple steps.\n\n> Did you know? Stories Are Weapons: Psychological Warfare and the American\n> Mind comes out in less than a month, and that means it\u2019s pre-order season!\n> More than ever, bookstores look at pre-orders as a way to figure out which\n> titles they should stock \u2013 this is especially true of the monster stores\n> like Amazon, whose algorithm promotes books based on pre-orders, but it\u2019s\n> also an indicator that indie bookstores look at too. So if you\u2019re thinking\n> of picking up a copy of Stories Are Weapons, smash that pre-order button\n> now. You can even order signed and personalized copies from my local indie,\n> Green Apple Books!\n\n## Step One: Did somebody say \u201canti-American\u201d?\n\nPay attention to media messages that paint groups of American people as\nforeign, or somehow not quite \u201creal\u201d Americans. You can see this currently in\nstories about student protesters being \u201canti-American,\u201d and in rhetoric that\nframes immigrants as \u201cforeign born\u201d aliens.\n\nMy book deals with the long history behind this rhetorical tactic. During the\n20th century, the U.S. government used it to justify firing hundreds of LGBT\npeople during the Lavender Scare. Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed that they\nwere too easily seduced or blackmailed by foreign influences. In the late 19th\ncentury, Jim Crow laws forced Black Americans to live in what was essentially\nanother country, with separate facilities and housing from white Americans.\nThis setup made it easy for the government to frame Black people as\nthreatening outsiders who shouldn\u2019t be permitted to vote.\n\nEven earlier, this kind of rhetoric was used against the people in thousands\nof Indigenous nations. Two centuries later, we still hear agitators and\npundits trying to undermine their American compeers by claiming that they are\nnot truly American.\n\nThere is a single, stark reason why this tactic is so often deployed. Psyops\nare weapons developed by the military, intended for use on a foreign enemy.\nPainting any group of people as \u201cforeign\u201d is a way of declaring that they are\nlegitimate targets for psyops. Culture warriors want to pit groups of\nAmericans against each other, inciting us to go to war with ourselves.\n\n## Step Two: Have you heard the one about deadly venomous snakes?\n\nTo recognize a psyop, it\u2019s useful to read military manuals devoted to\npsychological warfare. I immersed myself in the work of Paul Linebarger, the\nArmy intelligence operative who wrote the first U.S. guide to psychological\nwarfare in the late 1940s. (You can read about him in my previous newsletter.)\nThen I worked with an Army PSYOP instructor, who shared a declassified PSYOP\nmanual with me and taught me how special operations soldiers are trained to\nconduct influence campaigns today.\n\nOne of the throughlines between psyops in Linebarger\u2019s time and now is that\nthey are full of lies, wrapped around one or two nuggets of truth. A great\nexample is this simple leaflet from World War II, dropped on U.S. troops in\nthe Philippines by the Japanese. It\u2019s designed to look like a warning from the\nU.S. Army about \u201cdeadly venomous snakes.\u201d\n\nOf course there are snakes in the Philippines, so there\u2019s your bit of truth.\nIf an American soldier found this leaflet, however, their commanders would\ndeny (rightly) that it was legit. Then this soldier might start wondering if\nthere was some kind of cover-up, and perhaps their commander was knowingly\nsending them into the jungle to die. Psyops-level lies are designed to\ndestabilize an enemy, to make them doubt themselves and their compatriots, and\nto convince them that their country\u2019s institutions are untrustworthy.\n\nWhen psyops enter culture wars, you start to see lies structured like this\nsnake \u201cwarning.\u201d They don\u2019t just misrepresent a specific situation; they aim\nto undermine an entire system of beliefs. When right-wing groups warn about\nmalfunctioning voting machines, for example, the lie goes beyond the machines\nthemselves. It is an attack on the U.S. voting system.\n\n## Step Three: You cannot communicate with someone who says you should be dead\n\nAlong with lies, psyops often contain violent threats. Again, this is an\nexplicit part of military training in PSYOP development. That\u2019s because the\nmessage in war often boils down to \u201csurrender or die.\u201d This is the easiest\nkind of psyop to recognize when it pops up in your everyday doomscrolling.\nWhen somebody tells you to kill yourself, they are obviously deploying\nweaponized language. There is no way to argue with \u201cyou should die.\u201d It is not\na political position; it is a statement of intent do do harm.\n\nThat said, there are ways that violent threats enter so-called rational\npolitical debate in more subtle ways.\n\nTake, for example, the way reactionary politicians use the word \u201cgroomer\u201d to\ndescribe LGBT people. \u201cGroomer\u201d is a term that comes out of law enforcement,\nand is used to describe the behavior of an adult trying to gain the trust of a\nchild they intend to harm or abuse sexually. Calling someone a groomer is\nessentially calling them a criminal who should be incarcerated and have their\ncivil liberties taken away. In Stories Are Weapons, I trace the origin of the\n\u201cgroomer\u201d epithet back to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s 1930s campaign to\nroot out \u201csex criminals\u201d \u2013 his favorite term for LBGT Americans.\n\nCriminalizing a group of people is another way of threatening them with\nviolence and death. Calling for the imprisonment of any group \u2014 whether\nimmigrants, student protesters, or trans people \u2014 is not the opening gambit in\na debate. It is a way of shutting down discussion. It is, in short, a psyop.\n\nRecognizing psyops is one way to defuse them. Instead of engaging with people\nand organizations hurling weaponized messages at you, do anything else. Write\na letter, sit in a garden, talk to a friend, play a game, listen to music, or\nseek out information that isn\u2019t laced with lies and threats. We won\u2019t end this\nculture war by manufacturing better weapons. We must refuse to fight. We must\nrebuild our public sphere, not nuke it from orbit.\n\nIn Stories Are Weapons, I report on people and organizations who are trying to\nend culture wars by doing just that. They\u2019re telling new kinds of stories,\nprotecting our histories in archives, and changing the way social media\nconnects us with each other. They\u2019re also trying to repair the harms and\ntraumas caused by this often-unacknowledged war. Check it out on June 4, or\npre-order a copy today! Also, I\u2019ll be on book tour this summer, so come out to\nsee me and say hi!\n\n## Two Books to Think With\n\nRecently, a group of rebel historians in Texas broke away from the state\u2019s\nhistorical society to found a new organization, the Alliance for Texas\nHistory. It\u2019s a great example of why history matters deeply in culture war,\nand has done for centuries. And it reminded me of one of the books that\ninfluenced my thinking a lot: Ojibwe historian Jean M. O\u2019Brien\u2019s Firsting and\nLasting: Writing Indians Out of Existence in New England. It\u2019s about how New\nEngland historical societies in the 19th century produced boatloads of\namateur-written books about their towns that all made a weirdly similar claim.\nSomehow, these histories claimed, all the Indigenous people who used to live\nin the area had disappeared or gone extinct (after kindly giving their land to\nthe English, of course). Even weirder: Some of these same histories would\ndescribe groups of Indigenous people who currently lived in town. So were the\nIndians gone or not? Obviously they were very much not gone, but historians\nwere trying to make them invisible.\n\nI spoke with O\u2019Brien early in my research, and she told me this was part of a\nlarger cultural trend of white settlers conceiving of U.S. history as a story\nwhere Indigenous people conveniently \u201cdisappeared\u201d \u2014 it was history as psyops,\nand it went right alongside actual genocides happening in the West. O\u2019Brien\nmade me see how culture war and total war work together, especially on the\nlocal level. These books may have been little amateur histories, but they\ninfluenced their communities and justified the United States\u2019 ongoing wars\nwith western Indigenous nations.\n\nAnother book that I kept thinking about as I wrote was one that strongly\ninfluenced me when I was a young cultural critic: the late UC Berkeley\npolitical scientist Michael Rogin\u2019s Ronald Reagan the Movie, and Other\nEpisodes in Political Demonology. He was responding a moment in U.S. history\nthat is almost as surreal as our own. America\u2019s first Hollywood celebrity\npresident, Ronald Reagan, merged fiction and reality in his political rhetoric\nto usher in a new era of extreme conservatism. Rogin paired that event with\nothers in the nation\u2019s past, when storytelling became a surrogate for facts in\ngovernment policy. Acerbic and well-observed, this book is a reminder that the\nUnited States has a long history of selling its policies to the public using\nfantasy and fabulation.\n\n## Stuff I\u2019ve been working on lately\n\nJust in case you need more psyops, I wrote an article for The Atlantic about\nhow science fiction influenced psyops, and why conspiracy influencers often\nsound like they are regurgitating bad science fiction.\n\nI co-host the Our Opinions Are Correct podcast every other week with Charlie\nJane Anders, and our latest episode is about how stories get weaponized!
