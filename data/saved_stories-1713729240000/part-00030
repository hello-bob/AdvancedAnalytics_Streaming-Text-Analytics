Deadline June 1, 2024\n\n# 41 new projects awarded\n\nWe are happy to announce 41 new projects to our portfolio. That effectively\nmeans hundreds of people across the world working on great ideas that\ncontribute to the Next Generation Internet and a more open information\nsociety. The 41 new projects will be part of two different NGI Zero\nprogrammes: NGI0 Entrust (which supports people who are working on privacy and\ntrust enhancing technologies) in its final round sees no less than 30 teams\nreceiving funding. The NGI0 Core program welcomed 11 projects.\n\nProjects cover nine of the ten layers of the NGI technology stack, from\ntrustworthy open hardware to services and applications which provide autonomy\nfor end-users.\n\nWhat is clearly visible this round is a continued strong interest in web\nstandards. This includes exciting work on low level standards like\nWebXR/WebGPU (with projects like Wolvic, Renderling (and alternative usage of\nthese technologies in GPGPU Playground), but also higher level standards like\nActivityPub, Solid and upcoming technologies like WebXDC. It also includes\ncross-platform browser engines forming the basis of projects like Webkit and\nServo. There is a significant number of open hardware projects too, including\na project for low cost redox flow batteries, creating braille content,\ncompliance pre-testing for ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) and better testing\ntowards preventing fault injection in FPGA's.\n\n## NGI Zero funding\n\nNLnet has rolling calls with a deadline every two months. If you have a good\nidea that contributes to a better internet and digital commons we can build\nour societies on you can submit a proposal. The next deadline is June 1^st.\n\n## Meet the new projects\n\n(you can click or tap on the project name to fold out additional information)\n\n### Trustworthy hardware and manufacturing\n\n### Network infrastructure incl. routing, P2P and VPN\n\n### Software engineering, protocols, interoperability, cryptography,\nalgorithms, proofs\n\n### Operating Systems, firmware and virtualisation\n\n### Measurement, monitoring, analysis and abuse handling\n\n### Decentralised solutions, including blockchain/distributed ledger\n\n### Data and AI\n\n### Services + Applications (e.g. email, instant messaging, video chat,\ncollaboration)\n\n### Vertical use cases, Search, Community\n\nStill hungry for more projects?
