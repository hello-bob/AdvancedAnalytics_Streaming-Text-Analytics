What's Next for TikTok Users?\n\nDEEPLINKS BLOG\n\nBy Jason Kelley and Brendan Gilligan\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n# Biden Signed the TikTok Ban. What's Next for TikTok Users?\n\nShare It Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Copy link\n\nOver the last month, lawmakers moved swiftly to pass legislation that would\neffectively ban TikTok in the United States, eventually including it in a\nforeign aid package that was signed by President Biden. The impact of this\nlegislation isn\u2019t entirely clear yet, but what is clear: whether TikTok is\nbanned or sold to new owners, millions of people in the U.S. will no longer be\nable to get information and communicate with each other as they presently do.\n\n#### What Happens Next?\n\nAt the moment, TikTok isn\u2019t \u201cbanned.\u201d The law gives ByteDance 270 days to\ndivest TikTok before the ban would take effect, which would be on January\n19th, 2025. In the meantime, we expect courts to determine that the bill is\nunconstitutional. Though there is no lawsuit yet, one on behalf of TikTok\nitself is imminent.\n\nThere are three possible outcomes. If the law is struck down, as it should be,\nnothing will change. If ByteDance divests TikTok by selling it, then the\nplatform would still likely be usable. However, there\u2019s no telling whether the\napp\u2019s new owners would change its functionality, its algorithms, or other\naspects of the company. As we\u2019ve seen with other platforms, a change in\nownership can result in significant changes that could impact its audience in\nunexpected ways. In fact, that\u2019s one of the given reasons to force the sale:\nso TikTok will serve different content to users, specifically when it comes to\nChinese propaganda and misinformation. This is despite the fact that it has\nbeen well-established law for almost 60 years that U.S. people have a First\nAmendment right to receive foreign propaganda.\n\nLastly, if ByteDance refuses to sell, users in the U.S. will likely see it\ndisappear from app stores sometime between now and that January 19, 2025\ndeadline.\n\n#### How Will the Ban Be Implemented?\n\nThe law limits liability to intermediaries\u2014entities that \u201cprovide services to\ndistribute, maintain, or update\u201d TikTok by means of a marketplace, or that\nprovide internet hosting services to enable the app\u2019s distribution,\nmaintenance, or updating. The law also makes intermediaries responsible for\nits implementation.\n\nThe law explicitly denies to the Attorney General the authority to enforce it\nagainst an individual user of a foreign adversary controlled application, so\nusers themselves cannot be held liable for continuing to use the application,\nif they can access it.\n\n#### Will I Be Able to Download or Use TikTok If ByteDance Doesn\u2019t Sell?\n\nIt\u2019s possible some U.S. users will find routes around the ban. But the vast\nmajority will probably not, significantly shifting the platform's user base\nand content. If ByteDance itself assists in the distribution of the app, it\ncould also be found liable, so even if U.S. users continue to use the\nplatform, the company\u2019s ability to moderate and operate the app in the U.S.\nwould likely be impacted. Bottom line: for a period of time after January 19,\nit\u2019s possible that the app would be usable, but it\u2019s unlikely to be the same\nplatform\u2014or even a very functional one in the U.S.\u2014for very long.\n\nUntil now, the United States has championed the free flow of information\naround the world as a fundamental democratic principle and called out other\nnations when they have shut down internet access or banned social media apps\nand other online communications tools. In doing so, the U.S. has deemed\nrestrictions on the free flow of information to be undemocratic. Enacting this\nlegislation has undermined this long standing, democratic principle. It has\nalso undermined the U.S. government\u2019s moral authority to call out other\nnations for when they shut down internet access or ban social media apps and\nother online communications tools.\n\nThere are a few reasons legislators have given to ban TikTok. One is to change\nthe type of content on the app\u2014a clear First Amendment violation. The second\nis to protect data privacy. Our lawmakers should work to protect data privacy,\nbut this was the wrong approach. They should prevent any company\u2014regardless of\nwhere it is based\u2014from collecting massive amounts of our detailed personal\ndata, which is then made available to data brokers, U.S. government agencies,\nand even foreign adversaries. They should solve the real problem of out-of-\ncontrol privacy invasions by enacting comprehensive consumer data privacy\nlegislation. Instead, as happens far too often, our government\u2019s actions are\nvastly overreaching while also deeply underserving the public.\n\n## Related Issues\n\nFree Speech\n\nPrivacy\n\nSocial Networks\n\nBig Tech\n\nShare It Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Copy link\n\n## Join EFF Lists\n\n## Related Updates\n\nDeeplinks Blog by Molly Buckley | May 3, 2024\n\n### The U.S. House Version of KOSA: Still a Censorship Bill\n\nA companion bill to the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) was introduced in the\nHouse last month.
