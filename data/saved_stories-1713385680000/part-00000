(Image credit: Zenobillis via Getty\nImages)\n\nScientists have created a \"digital twin\" of our planet that can be used to\npredict weather far faster than traditional services.\n\nThe technology could help prevent some of the catastrophic impacts of\ndisasters such as typhoons and flooding. The intensive data-crunching system\ncould also give us a more detailed view of the future effects of climate\nchange and reveal clues about how to mitigate it.\n\nThe system is built by Nvidia, a multinational company that builds graphics\nprocessing units (GPUs), which are electronic circuits that can carry out\nhigh-speed mathematical equations that enable activities such as machine\nlearning, a type of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe platform, called Earth-2, contains a suite of machine learning\ntechnologies developed by Nvidia, all of it driven by supercomputers to\nprovide the immense processing power needed to do the job.\n\nCombined, these create \"a virtual replica of a physical object or system, in\nthis case, Earth's climate,\" Dion Harris, head of data center product\nmarketing at Nvidia, told Live Science.\n\nThe system takes the form of an interactive interface that runs simulations of\nweather and climate across the planet, allowing users to set different\nparameters and simulate weather in different locations at a highly detailed\n1.2-mile (2 kilometers) scale.\n\nRelated: Atlantic's hurricane alley is so hot from El Ni\u00f1o it could send\n2024's storm season into overdrive\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe AI technology has been trained on global datasets that provide hourly\nestimates of land, atmospheric and ocean climate variables. This system\n\"synthesizes hundreds of observations and reconstructs Earth's weather and\nclimate over the last 50 years or so,\" Harris said.\n\nImage showing Earth-2, which Nvidia calls our planet's \"digital twin.\" (Image\ncredit: NVIDIA)\n\nThe intensive training means the AI can quickly sift through troves of weather\nand climate data, churning out thousands upon thousands of potential outcomes\nand ultimately calculating the probability of certain weather outcomes in a\nparticular location.\n\nWhen it comes to approaching weather systems that could put lives at risk and\ncause millions in damage, Nvidia's system can therefore provide real-time\npredictions in seconds, rather than minutes or days, Harris said.\n\nThat can make the difference between life and death in places like Taiwan,\nwhere typhoons are frequent and catastrophic.\n\n\"When a typhoon warning is launched, the priority is to minimize casualties by\ncarrying out early evacuations,\" Harris said. For these reasons, Taiwan's\nCentral Weather Administration is one of the first to trial Nvidia's Earth-2\nsystem and will be using it to forecast, plan for and protect against extreme\nweather events this year.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014Which islands will become uninhabitable due to climate change first?\n\n\u2014Worrisome and even frightening': Ancient ecosystem of Lake Baikal at risk of\nregime change from warming\n\n\u2014Scientists create AI models that can talk to each other and pass on skills\nwith limited human input\n\nThe technology can also provide a detailed longer view of climate change.\nPredicting how climate change will unfold, and what its effects will be,\nrequires the processing of vast and numerous data streams on greenhouse gas\nemissions, temperature, global water cycles, land-use change, ocean chemistry\nand more. It also requires knowing how changes will unfold on global, regional\nand local scales, necessitating high data resolution.\n\nEarth-2's supercomputing power could rapidly parse through these vast data\nstreams to build accurate, predictive simulations, its developers say. That\nmight help cities explore the likelihood and intensity of future heat waves,\nfor instance, and take steps now to start mitigation measures.\n\nEmma Bryce\n\nLive Science Contributor\n\nEmma Bryce is a London-based freelance journalist who writes primarily about\nthe environment, conservation and climate change.
