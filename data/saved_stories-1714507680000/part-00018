The gap with\nEuropean living standards has never been wider.\n\nBy Arnaud Leparmentier (New York (United States) correspondent)\n\nPublished yesterday at 9:00 pm (Paris)\n\nTime to 10 min.\n\nLire en fran\u00e7ais\n\n  * Share\n\n    * Share on Facebook\n    * Share by email\n    * Share on Linkedin\n\nSubscribers only\n\nTimes Square, in New York City, United States, on April 7, 2024. CHARLY\nTRIBALLEAU / AFP\n\nWhen Elias Chedid moved to San Francisco, California, in 2017, he was quite\nhappy to double his salary compared to what he was earning in France. \"I\naccepted an offer at $85,000. I thought it was good. In reality, I'd been\nhad,\" said this young graduate of the HEC business school and mathematician.\nIn the meantime, this data scientist has changed jobs several times, moved to\nNew York and now earns almost $400,000 a year, including bonus shares.\n\n\"In France, I could never have seen my salary quadruple. The opportunities are\nfantastic,\" he said. \"When I come back to Paris, I feel like I'm super-rich.\nWhen I go out with my friends, I pay the bill. It costs me the price of a meal\nfor two in New York.\" This diagnosis is shared by Americans, who dream of sun\nin Europe, much like the French who retire in Marrakech, Morocco. One example\nof this is a report by TV channel CNBC, which on April 21 touted cheap\nretirement in France and Italy on its website: \"You can buy a home in France\nor Italy for 'the price of a new truck,'\" was the headline of the article,\nwhich featured an interview with Tommy Sikes, an American developer. \"I\nstarted discovering these incredible properties that were for sale in smaller\ntowns and villages for $50,000, $75,000, $100,000,\" he told CNBC, asserting\nthat \"the cost of living is literally 50%.\"\n\nThe reason for this is the massive retreat of French and European economies\ncompared to that of the United States. The comparison with 2016 is edifying.\nThat year had the advantage of being relatively uncontroversial, with the euro\ntrading at $1.15 (versus $1.07 today), and the after-effects of the financial\ncrisis and the euro had been overcome by the end of Barack Obama's presidency.\nThe evolution shows that Donald Trump's presidency, followed by that of Joe\nBiden, has been marked by an economic acceleration reminiscent of the golden\nage of corporations, the \"Gilded Age\" of the late 19^th century, with the\ntriumph of John Davison Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, J. P.\nMorgan and the \"Roaring Twenties,\" the 1920s of economic frenzy, inward-\nlooking attitudes and institutionalized racism.\n\nRead more Subscribers only US employment soars even higher than expected\nfollowing economic growth\n\nThe figures are dizzying. There's no denying the somewhat unimaginable market\ncapitalizations, starting with Microsoft ($3 trillion). Profits in 2023 are\nedifying: $94 billion for Apple, $72 billion for Microsoft, $61 billion for\nAlphabet, $55 billion for ExxonMobil and JP Morgan, and $40 billion for Meta.\n\n## 'Takeoff'\n\nAmericans are getting richer too. In 2016, gross domestic product (GDP) per\ncapita was $38,350 for France and $58,180 for the US, according to data from\nthe International Monetary Fund, a 50% gap. By 2023, the figures had risen to\n$47,360 and $85,370, an abysmal gap of 80%. Adjusted for purchasing power\nparities (PPPs), which provide a better measure of living standards, these\nfigures show that the gap has jumped from 30% to 40%.\n\nYou have 80.02% of this article left to read.
