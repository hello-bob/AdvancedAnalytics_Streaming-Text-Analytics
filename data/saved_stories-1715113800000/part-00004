Anyone on or outside the big blue planet gets pulled down to\nit. But here\u2019s a wild question you\u2019ve probably never considered: How would\ngravity behave if you were inside a heavy object? The answer is very\nsurprising, and quite beautiful.\n\nImagine you took the Earth and somehow scooped out the inside. Or, since we\ndon\u2019t want to damage our planet (for I suppose removing its core would be\nquite detrimental...), let\u2019s imagine something else.\n\nSay there was a planet out there somewhere, and rather than being a solid\nsphere, it was actually a spherical shell (essentially a hollowed out planet).\nTo visualize this, I\u2019m going to show only half the planet to stress that the\ninside is empty. Keep in mind that there is a top half not shown, and that the\nwhole planet is perfectly spherical.\n\nIf an astronaut were floating around in space somewhere near this planet, they\nwould be pulled toward it by its gravity. The fact that it is hollowed out\nwon\u2019t change this.\n\nNow here\u2019s where it gets interesting. What if the astronaut weren\u2019t outside\nthe planet, but rather inside the planet? What would gravity do if they found\nthemselves surrounded by the planet\u2019s mass?\n\nThe simplest case is one in which the astronaut is at the exact center of the\nsphere:\n\nA little thought suggests that they wouldn\u2019t feel any gravitational pull and\nwould therefore float. How come?\n\nGiven that they\u2019re at the exact center of the sphere, and given that the\nplanet\u2019s mass is equally distributed all around them, the gravitational pull\nwould be equal in all directions. So, whatever mass is pulling them to the\nleft would have a counteracting mass pulling them to the right. All forces\ncancel out, and the effects of gravity disappear. (Picture a game of tug of\nwar in which equally strong participants are pulling on the astronaut from all\ndirections; the astronaut wouldn\u2019t move.)\n\nNow we\u2019ve gotten to the real meat of the question. Here\u2019s what we really want\nto know. What happens to the astronaut (in terms of gravity) if they are\ninside the sphere, but not at the exact center? In which direction would they\nfall?\n\nTake a moment at think about it.\n\nI\u2019ll put in some filler text...\n\n...before I tell you the answer...\n\n...just in case you want to try and solve this yourself...\n\nYou might think that the astronaut gets pulled toward the nearest side. That\u2019s\ncertainly what I thought at first. After all, if they\u2019re positioned toward the\nleft side (as in the picture above), they\u2019re closer to the mass on the left\nthan the right.\n\nRight?\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re held to the gravity of the Earth and not that of heavier\nJupiter. We\u2019re closer to the Earth.\n\nExcept that, in this case, that isn\u2019t true. The astronaut wouldn\u2019t be pulled\nto the left. They wouldn\u2019t be pulled in any direction. No matter where inside\nthe sphere the astronaut is located, they would be weightless. The effects of\ngravity would be perfectly canceled out. And they wouldn\u2019t need to be at the\nexact center for that to happen.\n\n# The Shell Theorem\n\nThis concept, called the Shell Theorem, was discovered by Isaac Newton nearly\nfour-hundred years ago.\n\nHere\u2019s a succinct summary of the Shell Theorem: The gravitational forces\ninside the shell of a perfect sphere all cancel out, meaning there is no\ngravitational pull anywhere inside the sphere.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at why this happens. Without getting into the weeds of the math\ntoo much, it is important to note one thing you may remember from high school\nphysics: the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the\ninverse square of their distance (1/r^2 , where r is the distance between\nthem). Put differently, if you\u2019re one foot away from something, the pull from\nthat something would be four times stronger than if you were two feet away.\n(Doubling the distance divides the force by 2^2 ).\n\nNow, back to the astronaut. Recall that in the case where they were perfectly\ncentered, the left and right forces canceled out. My claim (or rather,\nNewton\u2019s claim) is that the same is true even if they\u2019re not at the center.\nAnd here\u2019s a picture that shows why:\n\nThat little green circle on the left represents an area of mass pulling to the\nleft. If we took the same angle (shown in red) on the right side, the circle\ndrawn out would be larger. So, even though the right side is farther away from\nthe astronaut, there is more mass contributing to the right-side pull.\n\nHow much more?\n\nSome basic math (which I won\u2019t get into here) shows that it\u2019s exactly\nproportional to the square of the distance. Therefore, even though gravity is\n1/r^2 weaker on the right, there is exactly r^2 more stuff on the right\nexerting that gravity. Those r^2 s cancel each other out all around the\nsphere, and every pull in every direction is precisely negated by a pull on\nthe opposite side.\n\n# A Perfect Universe\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you got lost in the proof. The takeaway is that this\nunintuitive fact didn\u2019t need to be true. The universe could have made the math\nmuch harder than high school trigonometry.\n\nBut, our universe is made up of mathematical laws that are much more elegant\nand understandable than we, frankly, deserve. Einstein once said, \u201cThe most\nincomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.\u201d I\ncouldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nIf gravity fell at a rate of 1/r, or 1/r^3 , or 1/r^2.1 , this wouldn\u2019t work.\nIf we didn\u2019t live in three dimensions of space, this wouldn\u2019t work. But the\nuniverse did give us a force of gravity that falls off at 1/r^2 , and it did\nput us in 3D. And the consequence is that anywhere inside of a perfectly\nspherical mass, there is no net gravitational force at all.\n\nSeveral months ago, I wrote an article in which I argued that there exist\naspects of the universe which are imperfect, like music, and which necessitate\na compromise on the part of humans. But seeing proofs of things like the Shell\nTheorem makes me second guess myself... If things do seem imperfect, it\u2019s much\nmore likely because we humans haven\u2019t yet found a way to understand them.\n\nZ-Axis\n\nThought-provoking articles in your inbox, published weekly, 100% free\n\nHome\n\nPosts\n\n\u00a9 2024 Nir Zicherman.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPowered by beehiiv\n\n", "frontpage": false}
