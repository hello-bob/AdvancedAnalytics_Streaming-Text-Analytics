One smelly solution could be the use\nof human feces.\n\nHungarian budget airline Wizz Air has announced plans to run 10% of its\nflights with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030, and it is turning to\nU.K.-based biofuel company Firefly, which turns sewage sludge into jet fuel,\nto make it happen.\n\n## \u2018Kind of disgusting\u2019\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Firefly CEO James Hygate described the\nbiosolids used by the group as \u201ckind of disgusting\u201d but \u201can amazing resource.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crumbly\u2014like compost or wet chocolate cake,\u201d Hygate said, as reported by\nthe Guardian.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s millions of tonnes of the stuff. And it has no intrinsic value.\u201d\n\nFirefly takes sewage sludge and converts it into two materials: biochar and\nbio-crude. The latter can be transformed into jet fuel, while the former has\nagricultural uses.\n\nWizz Air first announced a \u00a35 million ($6.3 million) equity investment in\nFirefly last year, as part of its move to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nSustainable jet fuel has proved a tough nut to crack, leaving operators in a\nrace to comply with regulators as the EU plots a minimum of 20% of jet fuel to\nqualify as SAF by 2035, rising to 70% by 2050.\n\nPotential solutions have taken many forms, but there hasn\u2019t yet been a silver\nbullet.\n\nSpeaking in September, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said the airline would need\nto use half the electricity production of its native Germany to survive solely\non SAF.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Habeck is going to give me that,\u201d Spohr said in reference\nto German energy minister Robert Habeck.\n\nA spokesperson for Lufthansa told Fortune at the time that the airline would\nbe able to fly for only two weeks on its current supply of SAF.\n\n## Smelly solution\n\nHuman waste won\u2019t be the sole solution and is likely to be used alongside\nother fuels like kerosene. Firefly\u2019s COO Paul Hilditch told ITV News there are\nenough biosolids in the U.K. to satisfy half of country\u2019s SAF demand by 2030.\n\nWizz Air is planning to incorporate the product into its aviation fuel by\n2028, the group says.\n\nThat will depend on Firefly scaling up operations to a commercial level, which\nwould be a world first for the fuel.\n\nThe company will start scaling with a factory in Harwich, Essex, which will\nserve two U.K. airports.\n\nHowever, Firefly still needs regulatory approval and funding to make it a\nfull-scale reality.\n\n\u201cAlongside fleet renewal and operational efficiency, sustainable aviation fuel\nplays a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions from aviation,\u201d said Yvonne\nMoynihan, corporate and ESG officer at Wizz Air.\n\n\u201cOur investment in Firefly, which has the potential to reduce our lifecycle\nemissions by 100,000 tonnes CO2-eq per year, underscores our commitment to\nmainstream the use of SAF in our operations by 2030,\u201d she noted.\n\n## Latest in Environment\n\n  * 4 days ago\n  * Environment - aviation\n\n## Human feces could power your Wizz Air flight within 4 years as world\u2019s\nfirst commercial operation planned in the U.K.\n\nBYRyan Hogg\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n  * 6 days ago\n  * Environment - European Union\n\n## Europe\u2019s antitrust watchdog probes China undercutting its $4 billion wind\nturbine market, saying: \u2018We saw the playbook\u2019 with solar power\n\nBYPrarthana Prakash\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\n  * 6 days ago\n  * Environment - climate change\n\n## Gen Z climate activists celebrate after Swiss boomers strike a blow for\nenvironmentalism in major European Court of Human Rights ruling\n\nBYMolly Quell, Raf Casert, and others\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\n  * 6 days ago\n  * Environment - Switzerland\n\n## Group of Swiss women win the first-ever climate case victory in Europe\u2019s\nhighest human rights court\n\nBYMolly Quell, Raf Casert, and others\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\n  * 7 days ago\n  * Environment - climate change\n\n## After being ravaged by wildfires last year, Greece now wants to pour $2.3\nbillion into fighting climate change and natural disasters\n\nBYPaul Tugwell, Sotiris Nikas, and others\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\n  * 11 days ago\n  * Environment - European Union\n\n## Protests, pandemics, and prices push Europe into reforming its Green Deal\n\nBYEwa Krukowska and Bloomberg\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 3 days ago\n  * Mind\n\n## Founder of Toms shoes went on a men\u2019s retreat with other entrepreneurs to\ncombat his loneliness and depression: \u2018I lost a lot of my clear meaning and\npurpose\u2019\n\nBYAlexa Mikhail\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Tech\n\n## Some ex-TikTok employees say the social media service worked closely with\nits China-based parent despite claims of independence\n\nBYAlexandra Sternlicht\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Leadership\n\n## Nike\u2019s boss says remote work was hurting innovation, so the company\nrealigned and is \u2018ruthlessly\u2019 focused on building a disruptive pipeline\n\nBYJason Ma\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Commentary\n\n## The tax code is made for tradwives.
