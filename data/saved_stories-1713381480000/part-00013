They included one by Peter Higgs, one by Robert\nBrout and Francois Englert, and one, slightly later but independent, by Gerald\nGuralnik, C. Richard Hagen, and Tom Kibble. This general idea was then\nincorporated into a specific theory of the real world\u2019s particles; this was\naccomplished in 1967-1968 in two papers, one written by Steven Weinberg and\none by Abdus Salam. The bare bones of this \u201cStandard Model of Particle\nPhysics\u201d was finally confirmed experimentally in 2012.\n\nHow precisely can mass come from a field? There\u2019s a short answer to this\nquestion, invented a couple of decades ago. It\u2019s the kind of answer that\nserves if time is short and attention spans are limited; it is intended to\nsound plausible, even though the person delivering the \u201cexplanation\u201d knows\nthat it is wrong. In my recent book, I called this type of little lie, a\ncompromise that physicists sometimes have to make between giving no answer and\ngiving a correct but long answer, a \u201cphib\u201d \u2014 a physics fib. Phibs are usually\nharmless, as long as people don\u2019t take them seriously. But the Higgs field\u2019s\nphib is particularly problematic.\n\n## The Higgs Phib\n\nThe Higgs phib comes in various forms. Here\u2019s a particularly short one:\n\nThere\u2019s this substance, like a soup, that fills the universe; that\u2019s the Higgs\nfield. As objects move through it, the soup slows them down, and that\u2019s how\nthey get mass.\n\nSome variants replace the soup with other thick substances, or even imagine\nthe field as though it were a crowd of people.\n\nHow bad is this phib, really? Well, here\u2019s the problem with it. This phib\nviolates several basic laws of physics. These include foundational laws that\nhave had a profound impact on human culture and are the first ones taught in\nany physics class. It also badly misrepresents what a field is and what it can\ndo. As a result, taking the phib seriously makes it literally impossible to\nunderstand the universe, or even daily human experience, in a coherent way.\nIt\u2019s a pedagogical step backwards, not forwards.\n\n## What\u2019s Wrong With The Higgs Phib\n\nSo here are my seven favorite reasons to put a flashing red warning sign next\nto any presentation of the Higgs phib.\n\n### 1\\. Against The Principle of Relativity\n\nThe phib brazenly violates the principle of relativity \u2014 both Galileo\u2019s\noriginal version and Einstein\u2019s updates to it. That principle, the oldest law\nof physics that has never been revised, says that if your motion is steady and\nyou are in a closed room, no experiment can tell you your speed, your\ndirection of motion, or even whether you are in motion at all. The phib\ndirectly contradicts this principle. It claims that\n\n  * if an object moves, the Higgs field affects it by slowing it down, while\n  * if it doesn\u2019t move, the Higgs field does nothing to it.\n\nBut if that were true, the action of the Higgs field could easily allow you to\ndistinguish steady motion from being stationary, and the principle of\nrelativity would be false.\n\n### 2\\. Against Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion\n\nThe phib violates Newton\u2019s first law of motion \u2014 that an object in motion not\nacted on by any force will remain in steady motion. If the Higgs field slowed\nthings down, it could only do so, according to this law, by exerting a force.\n\nBut Newton, in predicting the motions of the planets, assumed that the only\nforce acting on the planets was that of gravity. If the Higgs field exerted an\nadditional force on the planets simply because they have mass (or because it\nwas giving them mass), Newton\u2019s methods for predicting planetary motions would\nhave failed.\n\nWorse, the slowing from the Higgs field would have acted like friction over\nbillions of years, and would by now have caused the Earth to slow down and\nspiral into the Sun.\n\n### 3\\. Against Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion\n\nThe phib also violates Newton\u2019s second law of motion, by completely\nmisrepresenting what mass is. It makes it seem as though mass makes motion\ndifficult, or at least has something to do with inhibiting motion. But this is\nwrong.\n\nAs Newton\u2019s second law states, mass is something that inhibits changes in\nmotion. It does not inhibit motion, or cause things to slow down, or arise\nfrom things being slowed down. Mass is the property that makes it hard both to\nspeed something up and to slow it down. It makes it harder to throw a lead\nball compared to a plastic one, and it also makes the lead ball harder to\ncatch bare-handed than a plastic one. It also makes it difficult to change\nsomething\u2019s direction.\n\nTo say this another way, Newton\u2019s second law F=ma says that to make a change\nin an object\u2019s motion (an acceleration a) requires a force (F); the larger the\nobject\u2019s mass (m), the larger the required force must be. Notice that it does\nnot have anything to say about an object\u2019s motion (its velocity v).\n\nTo suggest that mass has to do with motion, and not with change in motion, is\nto suggest that Newton\u2019s law should be F=mv \u2014 which, in fact, many pre-\nNewtonian physicists once believed. Let\u2019s not let a phib throw us back to the\nmisguided science of the Middle Ages!\n\n### 4\\. Not a Universal Mass-Giver\n\nThe phib implies that the Higgs field gives mass to all objects with mass,\ncausing all of them to slow down. After all, if there were a universal \u201csoup\u201d\nfound everywhere, then every object would encounter it. If it were true that\nthe Higgs field acted on all objects in the same way \u2014 \u201cuniversally\u201d, similar\nto gravity, which pulls on all objects \u2014 then every object in our world would\nget its mass from the Higgs field.\n\nBut in fact, the Higgs field only generates the masses of the known elementary\nparticles. More complex particles such as protons and neutrons \u2014 and therefore\nthe atoms, molecules, humans and planets that contain them \u2014 get most of their\nmass in another way. The phib, therefore, can\u2019t be right about how the Higgs\nfield does its job.\n\n### 5\\. Not Like a Substance\n\nAs is true of all fields, the Higgs field is not like a substance, in contrast\nto soup, molasses, or a crowd. It has no density or materiality, as soup would\nhave. Instead, the Higgs field (like any field!) is more like a property of a\nsubstance.\n\nAs an analogue, consider air pressure (which is itself an example of an\nordinary field.) Air is a substance; it is made of molecules, and has density\nand weight. But air\u2019s pressure is not a thing; it is a property of air, , and\nis not itself a substance. Pressure has no density or weight, and is not made\nfrom anything. It just tells you what the molecules of air are doing.\n\nThe Higgs field is much more like air pressure than it is like air itself. It\nsimply is not a substance, despite what the phib suggests.\n\n### 6\\. Not Filling the Universe\n\nThe Higgs field does not \u201cfill\u201d the universe any more than pressure fills the\natmosphere. Pressure is found throughout the atmosphere, yes, but it is not\nwhat makes the atmosphere full. Air is what constitutes the atmosphere, and is\nthe only thing that can be said, in any sense, to fill it.\n\nWhile a substance could indeed make the universe more full than it would\notherwise be, a field of the universe is not a substance. Like the magnetic\nfield or any other cosmic field, the Higgs field exists everywhere \u2014 but the\nuniverse would be just as empty (and just as full) if the Higgs field did not\nexist.\n\n### 7\\. Not Merely By Its Presence\n\nFinally, the phib doesn\u2019t mention the thing that makes the Higgs field\nspecial, and that actually allows it to affect the masses of particles. This\nis not merely that it is present everywhere across the universe, but that it\nis, in a sense, \u201con.\u201d To give you a sense of what this might mean, consider\nthe wind.\n\nOn a day with a steady breeze, we can all feel the wind. But even when the\nwind is calm, physicists would say that the wind exists, though it is\ninactive. In the language I\u2019m using here, I would say that the wind is\nsomething that can always be measured \u2014 it always exists \u2014 but\n\n  * on a calm day it is \u201coff\u201d or \u201czero\u201d, while\n  * on a day with a steady breeze, it is \u201con\u201d or \u201cnon-zero\u201d.\n\nIn other words, the wind is always present, whether it is calm or steady; it\ncan always be measured.\n\nIn rough analogy, the Higgs field, though switched on in our universe, might\nin principle have been off. A switched-off Higgs field would not give mass to\nanything. The Higgs field affects the masses of elementary particles in our\nuniverse only because, in addition to being present, it is on. (Physicists\nwould say it has a \u201cnon-zero average value\u201d or a \u201cnon-zero vacuum expectation\nvalue\u201d)\n\nWhy is it on? Great question. From the theoretical point of view, it could\nhave been either on or off, and we don\u2019t know why the universe arranged for\nthe former.\n\n## Beyond the Higgs Phib\n\nI don\u2019t think we can really view a phib with so many issues as an acceptable\npseudo-explanation. It causes more problems and confusions than it resolves.\n\nBut I wish it were as easy to replace the Higgs phib as it is to criticize it.\nNo equally short story can do the job. If such a brief tale were easy to\nimagine, someone would have invented it by now.\n\nSome years ago, I found a way to explain how the Higgs field works that is\nnon-technical and yet correct \u2014 one that I would be happy to present to my\nprofessional physics colleagues without apology or embarrassment. (In fact, I\ndid just that in my recent talks at the physics departments at Vanderbilt and\nIrvine.) Although I tried delivering it to non-experts in an hour-long talk, I\nfound that it just doesn\u2019t fit. But it did fit quite well in a course for non-\nexperts, in which I had several hours to lay out the basics of particle\nphysics before addressing the Higgs field\u2019s role.\n\nThat experience motivated me to write a book that contains this explanation.\nIt isn\u2019t brief, and it\u2019s not a light read \u2014 the universe is subtle, and I\ndidn\u2019t want to water the explanation down. But it does deliver what it\npromises. It first carefully explains what \u201celementary particles\u201d and fields\nreally are [here\u2019s more about fields] and what it means for such a \u201cparticle\u201d\nto have mass. Then it gives the explanation of the Higgs field\u2019s effects \u2014 to\nthe extent we understand them. (Readers of the book are welcome to ask me\nquestions about its content; I am collecting Q&A and providing additional\nresources for readers on this part of the website.)\n\nA somewhat more technical explanation of how the Higgs field works is given\nelsewhere on this website: check out this series of pages followed by this\nsecond series, with additional technical information available in this third\nseries. These pages do not constitute a light read either! But if you are\ncomfortable with first-year university math and physics, you should be able to\nfollow them. Ask questions as need be.\n\nBetween the book, the above-mentioned series of webpages, and my answers to\nyour questions, I hope that most readers who want to know more about the Higgs\nfield can find the explanation that best fits their interests and background.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPrevPreviousUpdate to the Higgs FAQ\n\n  * Higgs\n  * cx Higgs field\n\n## Share via:\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\n### One Response\n\n  1.
