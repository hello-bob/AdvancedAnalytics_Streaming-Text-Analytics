That\u2019s the promise of a new \u00a3124 million national electron\nmicroscope facility to be built in Cheshire, UK. The aim is to enable\nresearchers to translate an understanding of physicochemical transitions into\nnew materials and products to address some of society\u2019s biggest challenges,\nfrom climate change to drug discovery.\n\nSource: \u00a9 University of Liverpool\n\nThe government wants the new centre to make the UK a leader in electron\nmicroscopy\n\nThe funding body UK Research and Innovation says that the facility, known as\nRuedi (relativistic ultra-fast electron diffraction and imaging), will be \u2018the\nmost powerful high energy electron microscope in the world\u2019. It will have two\nbeamlines, one to provide ultrafast resolution snapshots (of quadrillionths of\na second), and a high voltage imaging line to reveal chemical dynamics as they\nhappen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigel Browning, a materials scientist based at the University of Liverpool\nexplains that this unique combination of spatial and temporal resolution will\noffer insights allowing scientists to develop new materials, for example, to\nwithstand earthquakes or produce longer lasting batteries or catalysts.\nBrowning, an electron microscopy specialist, who will direct the building and\ntesting of Ruedi, explains: \u2018You can make the chemical compounds in the gas\nphase, and you can look at the[ir] dynamics. Then you want to see how the\ndynamics change when you get to the liquid and the solid phase because that\u2019s\nwhen you start to make a device out of them.\u2019 He notes that insights gained at\nthe facility will support materials applications across the research themes of\nquantum, biology, energy and how materials perform under extreme conditions.\n\n\u2018Ultimately all these challenges relate to complex chemical systems ...\ninterconnected reactions from which products emerge,\u2019 says University of Leeds\nresearcher Sven Schroeder, who will lead the chemical dynamics work at Ruedi.\nHe gives the crystallisation of an organic compound from its solution as an\nexample of highly selective structure control that has applications from\nmedicine to agrochemicals.\n\nSource: \u00a9 A.P.S. (UK)/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nRuedi will be built at the Science and Technology Facilities Council\u2019s\nDaresbury campus in Cheshire\n\n\u2018What steers the organic molecules to reproducibly form the same crystal\nstructure every time?\u2019 he asks. \u2018If we knew, we could design interventions,\nfor example, combined use of pH, chemical additives, different solvents,\ndifferent temperatures and pressures, to target new crystal structures with\ndifferent physical properties.\u2019 Applications would be in the development of\nnew medicine formulations with tailor-made release profiles, explains\nSchroeder. \u2018Longer term, could we design formulations that mimic cell\nbehaviour \u2013 for example can we formulate a cancer drug in the form of an\nartificial cell that recognises when it encounters, say, cancer tissue and\nthen releases the drug payload?\u2019\n\nThe high voltages Ruedi will use will allow scientists to image \u2018thicker\u2019\nsamples, such as a biological cell, as opposed to individual structures or\nproteins. This could hasten drug development, suggests Browning, because\nresearchers will be able to see drug impacts on the whole cell, including\nunintended consequences.\n\nThis content is provided by Twitter.

Browning explains this is because researchers will be\nable to examine the individual mechanisms taking place as ions in a battery\npass from solution to the electrode in each charging cycle, and that limit and\ndegrade battery performance.\n\nRuedi will be the first UK national facility built since the AI revolution,\nand the project team plan to build the technology into every part of the\nprocess from identifying potential users and training them, through to image\ninterpretation.\n\nWith the project already six years in the making, it will take another seven\nto build a fully functioning facility, which will be based at the Daresbury\nLaboratory in Cheshire. All the technology exists, says Browning, but has\nnever been integrated to create the combination of spatial and temporal\nresolution Ruedi will provide. State of the art components will have to be\nconstructed, commissioned and tested. \u2018We\u2019ve started developing the process\nand looking for people with ideas for experiments that we could run through\nthe commissioning and testing phase,\u2019 adds Browning. Because Ruedi will be\nexpensive to use, a digital twin will be built alongside to aid the design of\nexperiments to give researchers confidence that they will get a result.\n\nRuedi is part of a \u00a3388 million UKRI infrastructure investment that will also\nprovide \u00a349 million for cutting edge instrumentation for high throughput and\nhigh precision mass spectrometry. The hub and spoke model will enable\nresearchers to share equipment, data and expertise to gain new insights into\nmolecular structures and functions of new materials for quantum technologies,\nsemiconductors, batteries, catalysts and medicines.\n\nAngeli Mehta\n\n  * Follow\n\nAngeli Mehta is a freelance science writer with a research PhD, based in\nEdinburgh, UKView full profile\n\n## More from Angeli Mehta\n\n  * ## Industry\u2019s water sustainability crisis\n\n  * ## The start-ups taking on climate change by extracting carbon dioxide from the sea\n\n  * ## EU sees big role for carbon capture to meet emissions targets\n\n## Topics\n\n  * Analytical chemistry\n  * Europe\n  * Funding\n  * Government\n  * Imaging and microscopy\n  * infrastructure\n  * United Kingdom\n\n  * No comments\n\n  * Bookmark\n\nPlease Sign in to your account to use this feature\n\n### Related articles\n\n  * News\n\n### Diamond Light Source upgrade receives \u00a3500 million funding boost\n\n12 September 2023 08:30\n\nBy Julia Robinson\n\n  * News\n\n### Energy costs and supply shortages hit European research infrastructure\n\n10 August 2023 08:30\n\nBy Julia Robinson\n\n  * News\n\n### Boost for UK XFEL hopes as UKRI unveils research infrastructure plans\n\n20 June 2022 13:30\n\nBy Jamie Durrani\n\n  * Research\n\n### Microscopy structures reveal mechanism behind bitter taste\n\n15 April 2024 13:30\n\nBy Julia Robinson\n\n  * Opinion\n\n### When the blood keeps on flowing\n\n12 April 2024 08:35\n\nBy Raychelle Burks\n\n  * News\n\n### US finally gets nationwide regulation of PFAS in drinking water\n\n11 April 2024 14:55\n\nBy Rebecca Trager\n\n### No comments yet\n\nYou're not signed in.
