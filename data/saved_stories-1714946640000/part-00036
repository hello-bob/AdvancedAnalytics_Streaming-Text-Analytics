This study\ninvestigated factors associated with biomarkers of metal exposure.\n\nMethods Data were drawn from Wave 5 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco\nand Health (PATH) Study Youth Panel, a nationally representative sample of US\nadolescents aged 13\u201317 years. Urinary biomarkers of exposure to cadmium, lead,\nand uranium were assessed by vaping frequency (occasional (1\u20135 days),\nintermittent (6\u201319 days), and frequent (20+ days)) in the past 30 days and\nflavour type (menthol/mint, fruit, and sweet).\n\nResults Among 200 exclusive e-cigarette users (median age 15.9 years, 62.9%\nfemale), 65 reported occasional use, 45 reported intermittent use, and 81\nreported frequent use. The average number of recent puffs per day increased\nexponentially by vaping frequency (occasional: 0.9 puffs, intermittent: 7.9\npuffs, frequent: 27.0 puffs; p=0.001). Both intermittent (0.21 ng/mg\ncreatinine) and frequent users (0.20 ng/mg creatinine) had higher urine lead\nlevels than occasional users (0.16 ng/mg creatinine). Frequent users also had\nhigher urine uranium levels compared with occasional users (0.009 vs 0.005\nng/mg creatinine, p=0.0004). Overall, 33.0% of users preferred using\nmenthol/mint flavours, 49.8% fruit flavours, and 15.3% sweet flavours. Sweet\nflavour users had higher uranium levels compared with menthol/mint users\n(0.009 vs 0.005 ng/mg creatinine, p=0.02).\n\nConclusions Vaping in early life could increase the risk of exposure to\nmetals, potentially harming brain and organ development. Regulations on vaping\nshould safeguard the youth population against addiction and exposure to\nmetals.\n\n  * Electronic nicotine delivery devices\n  * Heavy Metals\n  * Priority/special populations\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nData are available upon reasonable request.

Frequent users also had higher urine uranium levels than occasional users.\n\n  * Individuals who preferred sweet flavours in their vaping had higher uranium levels than e-cigarette users who favoured menthol or mint flavours.\n\n#### HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY\n\n  * By leveraging a national survey and biospecimen analysis, our study shows a correlation between vaping frequency and heightened metal exposure.\n\n  * The findings of this study underscore the importance of implementing vaping regulations and targeted prevention strategies for adolescents.\n\n## Introduction\n\nE-cigarettes have been the primary mode of nicotine consumption in the youth\npopulation since 2014.1 In 2022, an estimated 14.1% of high school students\n(~2.14 million) and 3.3% of middle school students (~380 000) reported current\n(past 30-day) e-cigarette use (or vaping).2 E-cigarettes are now used more\nregularly and at increased intensity by adolescents, and e-cigarette addiction\nhas surpassed all other modes of tobacco consumption combined as of 2019.3 The\ne-cigarette products are currently marketed with a variety of flavours (eg,\nmint, menthol, fruit, sweet) that are appealing to youth.4 Nevertheless, there\nis limited understanding of the long-term health consequences of e-cigarette\nuse among adolescents.5\n\nCertain metal elements have been identified in e-cigarette aerosols, liquids,\nand in human biospecimens across several studies.6\u20138 Metal concentrations vary\nby device type and brand but are consistently detected within e-cigarette\naerosols and liquids.9 Additionally, a positive association was found between\nthe number of puffs and metal concentration in both liquids and aerosols.10\nIngestion of metals associated with tobacco and e-cigarette use is known to\ncause systemic harm in both acute and chronic exposures. They are of\nparticular importance during child and adolescent development.11 An increased\noverall metal exposure burden has been linked to cognitive impairment,\nbehavioural disturbances, respiratory complications, cancer, and\ncardiovascular diseases in children.11 In a global burden of disease analysis,\nLarsen and Sanchez-Triana described how chronic low-level lead exposure is a\nmajor health concern with significant effects on cardiovascular and\nneurocognitive outcomes.12 This is concerning for adolescents who use\ne-cigarette products, as lead affects cognitive and psychiatric development\nand has also been shown to biodistribute into the brain in mouse models\nexposed to e-cigarette aerosols.13 14 Cadmium exposure increases the risk for\nosteoporosis. It acts as a major carcinogen through multiple biochemical\nmechanisms, with a particular risk for neoplasms of the nasopharynx, lung,\nbreast, pancreas, prostate, and bladder.15\n\nBiomarker studies can provide unique and reliable insights into toxic exposure\namong individuals who vape, which helps elucidate the health effects of\ne-cigarette use. A previous adult study reported that levels of metal exposure\nbiomarkers such as lead and cadmium were approximately 19% and 23% lower in\nnever users than exclusive e-cigarette users, respectively.16 Data from the\n2013\u20132016 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study further\nshowed significantly elevated urinary levels of cadmium and lead in adults who\nused e-cigarettes compared with never users.17 Tobacco plants can absorb\nuranium from the soil, and traces of uranium have been found in tobacco\nleaves.18 In 2018 the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)\nlisted uranium as one of 23 priority pollutants due to its high toxicity to\nliving organisms at elevated concentrations.19 A strong positive association\nhas been discovered between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and\nuranium levels.20 However, objective assessment of metal exposure in\nadolescent e-cigarette users is lacking.14\n\nThis study analysed a national probability sample of adolescents aged 13\u201317\nyears to assess metal exposure among adolescent e-cigarette users with two\nprimary research questions: (1) Are metal concentration levels positively\nassociated with the frequency of e-cigarette use? (2) Does the metal exposure\nvary by e-cigarette flavour type used?\n\n## Methods\n\n### Data collection\n\nData were collected from Wave 5 (December 2018 to November 2019) of the PATH\nYouth Study using a nationally representative sample of US civilian non-\ninstitutionalised individuals. Participants completed a survey during an\ninterview and voluntarily provided in-person urine samples. Wave 5 urine\nsamples for planned laboratory analyses were collected from adolescents who\nhad previously participated in the Wave 4 youth interview. A probability\nsample of participants who provided sufficient urine samples was selected from\na diverse mix of six tobacco product use groups representing never, current,\nand recent former (within 12 months) users of tobacco products.21\n\nThe PATH study was conducted using a 4-stage stratified probability sampling\ndesign with a weighted response rate of 88.0% for the Wave 5 survey. The PATH\ndata collection was approved by Westat\u2019s Institutional Review Board. Metals\nwere directly measured from urine specimens using mass spectrometry following\na simple dilution sample preparation step.21 The PATH youth interview survey\nand youth urine biomarker data were linked through a de-identified personal\nID.\n\nThe PATH Wave 5 Youth biomarker sample included 1607 participants who\ncompleted urine biospecimen assessments and survey interviews. After excluding\nparticipants who reported using nicotine replacement therapies in the past 3\ndays or those with creatinine levels \u226410 mg/dL or >370 mg/dL (n=62), the\ncombined dataset included 1545 participants. To mitigate confounding effects,\nwe further excluded 203 current users of other tobacco products, 27\nparticipants unsure about whether their e-cigarettes contained nicotine, 1059\nnon-users of e-cigarettes, and 56 non-nicotine e-cigarette users, resulting in\na final analytical sample of 200 nicotine e-cigarette users (figure 1).\n\n  * Download figure\n  * Open in new tab\n  * Download powerpoint\n\nFigure 1\n\nFlowchart of participants included in the analytical sample.\n\n### Measures\n\n#### Biomarker outcomes\n\nThe outcomes included three urinary metals: cadmium, lead, and uranium. At\nWave 1\u20132, the PATH Study measured a panel of metals in urine including\nberyllium, cadmium, cobalt, lead, manganese, strontium, thallium, and uranium.\nAt Wave 3 and beyond, the PATH Study measured only cadmium, lead, and uranium.\nSince youth biomarker data were collected at Wave 5, our analysis was limited\nto three metals. The limits of detection (LOD) for cadmium, lead, and uranium\nare 0.055 \u03bcg/L, 0.022 \u03bcg/L, and 0.0024 \u03bcg/L, respectively. Biomarker\nconcentrations that fell below the LOD were replaced through a standard\nsubstitution formula, calculated as the LOD divided by the square root of 2.22\n\n#### E-cigarette use status\n\nParticipants who reported using e-cigarettes \u22651 day in the past 30 days were\nclassified as current e-cigarette users. Based on the number of days\ne-cigarettes were used in the past 30 days, current e-cigarette users were\ngrouped as occasional (1\u20135 days), intermittent (6\u201319 days), and frequent (20+\ndays) users.23 Participants who reported using \u22651 day of other tobacco\nproducts (ie, cigarettes, cigars, pipe, hookah, smokeless tobacco, bidi,\nkretek) in the past 30 days were excluded from the analysis to limit\nconfounding effects.24\n\n#### E-cigarette flavour types\n\nCurrent e-cigarette users were asked which flavours they have used in the past\n30 days. Those who reported using two or more flavours were further asked\nwhich flavours they had used most often. We grouped responses into four\nmutually exclusive categories: menthol or mint, fruit, sweet (ie, chocolate,\ncandy, desserts or other sweets), and others (ie, tobacco, clove or spice, an\nalcoholic drink, a non-alcoholic drink, some other flavours).\n\n#### Other variables\n\nOther tobacco and e-cigarette use variables included exposure to secondhand\ntobacco use (yes/no) based on the participants\u2019 responses regarding whether\nthey live with someone currently using tobacco products, and the type of\ne-cigarette devices used measured by the question: \u201cPlease think about the\nelectronic nicotine product you use most often, what kind of electronic\nnicotine product is it?\u201d with categories \u2018a device that uses replaceable\nprefilled cartridge\u2019, \u2018a device with a tank that you refill with liquids\u2019, and\n\u2018other\u2019 (a disposable device, a mod system, and something else).\n\nDemographic factors included age (continuous, 13\u201317 years old), sex\n(male/female), race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, other races),\nand annual household income (<US$50 000 and \u2265US$50 000).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nWeighted sample characteristics were reported overall and by vaping frequency.\nGroup differences were detected using the Rao\u2013Scott \u03c7^2 test for categorical\nvariables and linear regression for continuous variables. Due to the skewness\nin the distribution, biomarker data were transformed using a natural log.\n\nGeometric mean and 95% CIs of creatinine-corrected levels of concentration for\nmetals of interest were calculated. Multivariable linear regression models\ntested pairwise differences in urinary biomarkers by vaping frequency and\nflavour types, controlling for age, sex, exposure to secondhand tobacco, and\ndevice type. The surveyreg procedure was conducted using the log-transformed\nmetal levels normalised by the creatinine level (eg, ln(metal/creatinine)) as\nthe dependent variables. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) was calculated by\nexponentiating the beta coefficient from a model based on log-transformed\nmetal levels. Analyses applied urinary sample single-wave weight, 100\nreplicated weights, and the balanced repeated replication method with Fay\u2019s\nadjustment 0.3 to account for the complex design of the PATH Study.\nStatistical analysis was conducted in SAS 9.4 with p<0.05 (two-tailed)\nconsidered to be significant.\n\n## Results\n\nAmong 200 exclusive e-cigarette users (median age 15.9 years, 62.9% female),\n65 reported occasional use, 45 reported intermittent use, 81 reported frequent\nuse, and nine had missing vaping frequency. The average number of recent puffs\nper day increased exponentially by vaping frequency (occasional=0.9 puffs,\nintermittent=7.9 puffs, frequent=27.0 puffs; p=0.001). Overall, 33.0% of users\nreported using menthol/mint flavours, 49.8% favoured fruit flavours, 15.3%\nopted for sweet flavours, and 1.9% of users reported other flavours in the\nlast 30 days.

We found that greater\ne-cigarette use frequency is associated with higher lead and uranium biomarker\nlevels in individuals who are intermittent and frequent users. It should be\nnoted that, while cadmium, lead, and uranium have all been found in\ne-cigarette aerosols according to prior literature,14 25 their amounts vary\nsignificantly by brand and type of vapouriser used (eg, tank, pod, mod); such\nstudies, while informative, may not be entirely representative of typical use\nconditions.25 Nonetheless, these compounds are known to cause harm in humans.\nChronic exposure to lead at low levels has been shown to have adverse effects\non cardiovascular and renal systems, cognitive and psychiatric development,\nand decreased fertility in both sexes.26 Uranium can cause local cytotoxic\neffects when inhaled, as well as renal tubular toxicity as a major effect.27\n\nThe intensity of e-cigarette use has surged among US teenagers, many of whom\nnow report regular use, with sharp increases in vaping intensity and addiction\nlevels.3 Compared with the previous PATH biomarker study in adults from 2013\nto 2016,17 our Youth study using the data from 2018 to 2019 did not find a\nstatistically significant increase in cadmium biomarkers across vaping\nfrequency. The reasons behind this difference are unclear, but may be\nattributable to changes in the manufacturing materials used for the heating\nelements. These two studies focused on different populations, with youth and\nadults potentially having different patterns of e-cigarette use. There may\nhave been changes over time in e-cigarette devices and e-liquid formulations\nthat could influence the results. Nonetheless, there remains a historical\nassociation between tobacco product use and exposure to cadmium. In addition,\nincreased uranium biomarkers found within the sweet flavour category are of\nparticular concern because candy-flavoured e-cigarette products make up a\nsubstantial proportion of adolescent vapers,28 and sweet taste in e-cigarettes\ncan suppress the harsh effects of nicotine and enhance its reinforcing\neffects, resulting in heightened brain cue-reactivity.29\n\nMeasures selected for this study were taken to maximise statistical power\nwhile maintaining validity across covariates within the confines of the sample\nsize, although it is worth noting that the number of subjects exposed to\nsecondhand tobacco use does vary by user frequency categories (eg, 29.2%\noccasional vs 56.5% frequent). Secondhand tobacco use might be a source of\nmetal exposure among adolescents.30 31 Therefore, this study adjusted the\nexposure to secondhand tobacco use and types of e-cigarette devices along with\ndemographics in the multivariable regressions. As a result, despite the fact\nthat 95% CIs of uranium levels between sweet and menthol/mint overlap (mean\n(95% CI) 0.009 (0.004 to 0.023) vs 0.005 (0.003 to 0.007)), the adjusted GMR\nof 1.9 (1.1 to 3.3) indicates that the uranium levels in sweet flavour users\nwere almost twice as high as in menthol/mint flavour users after controlling\nfor covariates.\n\n### Study limitations\n\nThis study has limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of the study\nrestricts causal inference. Second, urine lead correlates with blood levels\nbut varies in prediction from one sample. Urine uranium and lead signal\nchronic exposure, yet a single time point is inadequate for assessment. Third,\nthe presence of uranium in the urine may be attributed to various sources\nincluding environmental exposure from natural deposits, industrial activities,\nand dietary intake. Future studies should take geographical regions into\naccount.32 Uranium or its compounds could potentially be present in\ne-cigarette aerosols or e-liquids, either as contaminants or byproducts of the\nheating process. However, the specific sources and pathways of uranium\nexposure in this context are not well understood and would require further\nresearch to elucidate. Finally, small sample sizes may have resulted in\ninadequate statistical power and limited the inclusion of participants\nreporting other flavours (n=7) in the biomarker analyses.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nDespite the limitations, this study reported increased urine lead and uranium\nlevels associated with vaping frequency. Sweet flavours might pose an\nadditional risk of exposure to uranium. E-cigarette use during adolescence may\nincrease the likelihood of metal exposure, which could adversely affect brain\nand organ development. These findings call for further research, vaping\nregulation, and targeted public health interventions to mitigate the potential\nharms of e-cigarette use, particularly among adolescents.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nData are available upon reasonable request.
