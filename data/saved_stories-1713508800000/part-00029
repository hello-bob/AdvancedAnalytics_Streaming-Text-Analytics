And today that spirit of spring cleaning is coming to the entry-level\nsegment of NVIDIA\u2019s professional visualization lineup, where NVIDIA is\nintroducing a pair of new desktop cards based on their low-end Ampere\nhardware.\n\nThe new RTX A1000 and RTX A400 cards will be replacing the T1000/T600/T400\nlineup, which was released three years ago in 2021. The new cards slot into\nthe same entry-level category and finally finish fleshing out the RTX A series\nof proviz cards, offering NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere-generation professional graphics\ntechnologies in the lowest-power, lowest-performance, lowest-cost\nconfiguration possible.\n\nNotably, since the entry-level T-series were based on NVIDIA\u2019s feature-limited\nTU11x silicon, which lacked ray tracing and tensor core support \u2013 the basis of\nNVIDIA\u2019s RTX technologies and associated branding \u2013 this marks the first time\nthese technologies will be available in NVIDIA\u2019s entry-level desktop proviz\ncards. And accordingly, these are being promoted to RTX-branded video cards,\nending the odd overlap with NVIDIA\u2019s compute cards, which never carry RTX\nbranding.\n\nIt goes without saying that as low-end cards, the ray tracing performance of\neither part is nothing to write home about, but it gives NVIDIA\u2019s current\nproviz lineup a consistent set of graphics features from top to bottom.\n\nNVIDIA Professional Visualization Card Specification Comparison  \n---  \nA1000| A400| T1000| T400  \nCUDA Cores| 2304| 768| 896| 384  \nTensor Cores| 72| 24| N/A| N/A  \nBoost Clock| 1460MHz| 1755MHz| 1395MHz| 1425MHz  \nMemory Clock| 12Gbps GDDR6| 12Gbps GDDR6| 10Gbps GDDR6| 10Gbps GDDR6  \nMemory Bus Width| 128-bit| 64-bit| 128-bit| 64-bit  \nVRAM| 8GB| 4GB| 8GB| 4GB  \nSingle Precision| 6.74 TFLOPS| 2.7 TFLOPS| 2.5 TFLOPS| 1.09 TFLOPS  \nTensor Performance| 53.8 TFLOPS| 21.7 TFLOPS| N/A| N/A  \nTDP| 50W| 50W| 50W| 30W  \nCooling| Active, SS| Active, SS| Active, SS| Active, SS  \nOutputs| 4x mDP 1.4a| 4x mDP 1.4a| 3x mDP 1.4a  \nGPU| GA107| TU117  \nArchitecture| Ampere| Turing  \nManufacturing Process| Samsung 8nm| TSMC 12nm  \nLaunch Date| 04/2024| 05/2024| 05/2021| 05/2021  \n  \nBoth the A1000 and A400 are based on the same board design, with NVIDIA doing\naway with any pretense of physical feature differentiation this time around\n(T400 was missing its 4^th Mini DisplayPort). This means both cards are based\non the GA107 GPU, sporting different core and memory configurations.\n\nRTX A1000 is a not-quite-complete configuration of GA107, with 2304 CUDA cores\nand 72 tensor cores. This is paired with 8GB of GDDR6, which runs at 12Gbps,\nfor a total of 192GB/second of memory bandwidth. The TDP of the card is 50\nWatts, matching its predecessor.\n\nMeanwhile RTX A400 is far more cut down, offering about a third of the active\nhardware on the GPU itself, and half the memory bandwidth. On paper this gives\nit around 40% of T1000\u2019s performance, and half the memory bandwidth \u2013 or\n96GB/second. Notably, despite the hardware cut-down, the official TDP is still\n50 Watts, versus the 30 Watts of its predecessor. So at this point NVIDIA will\nsoon cease offering a desktop proviz card lower than 50 Watts.\n\nAs noted before, both cards otherwise feature the same physical design, with a\nhalf-height half-length (HHHL) board with active cooling. As you\u2019d expect from\nsuch low-TDP cards, these are single-slot cooler designs. Both cards feature a\nquartet of Mini DisplayPorts, with the same DP 1.4a functionality that we\u2019ve\nseen across all of NVIDIA\u2019s products for the last several years.\n\nFinally, video-focused users will want to make note that the A1000/A400 have\nslightly different video capabilities. While A1000 gets access to both of\nGA107\u2019s NVDEC video decode blocks, A400 only gets access to a single block \u2013\none more cutback to differentiate the two cards. Otherwise, both video cards\nget access to the GPU\u2019s sole NVENC block.\n\nAccording to NVIDIA, the RTX A1000 will be available starting today through\nits distribution partners. Meanwhile the RTX A400 will hit distribution\nchannels in May, and with OEMs expected to begin offering the cards as part of\ntheir pre-built systems this summer.\n\nSource: NVIDIA\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n  * ### Post Your Comment\n\nPlease log in or sign up to comment.\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n## 0 Comments\n\n### View All Comments\n\n## PIPELINE STORIES\n\n\\+ Submit News\n\nASML Patterns First Wafer Using High-NA EUV Tool, Ships Second High-NA Scanner\nIntel and Sandia National Labs Roll Out 1.15B Neuron \u201cHala Point\u201d Neuromorphic\nResearch System Samsung Unveils 10.7Gbps LPDDR5X Memory - The Fastest Yet\n\n  * Samsung To Receive $6.4 Billion Under CHIPS Act to Build $40 Billion Fab in Texas\n  * NVIDIA Intros RTX A1000 and A400: Entry-Level ProViz Cards Get Ray Tracing\n  * Corsair Enters Workstation Memory Market with WS Series XMP/EXPO DDR5 RDIMMs\n  * Western Digital Previews 4 TB SD Card: World's Highest-Capacity\n  * AMD Quietly Launches Ryzen 7 8700F and Ryzen 5 8400F Processors\n  * Intel Teases Lunar Lake At Intel Vision 2024: 100+ TOPS Overall, 45 TOPS From NPU Alone\n  * Intel To Discontinue Boxed 13th Gen Core CPUs for Enthusiasts\n  * Report: Impact of Taiwanese Earthquake on DRAM Output to be Negligible in Q2\n  * Google Develops In-House Arm 'Axion' CPU for Datacenters\n\n## LINKS\n\n  * Home\n  * About\n  * Forums\n  * RSS\n  * Pipeline News\n  * Bench\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Contact Us\n  * Accessibility Statement\n\n## TOPICS\n\n  * CPUs\n  * Motherboards\n  * SSD/HDD\n  * GPUs\n  * Mobile\n  * Enterprise & IT\n  * Smartphones\n  * Memory\n  * Cases/Cooling/PSU(s)\n\n  * Displays\n  * Mac\n  * Systems\n  * Cloud\n  * Trade Shows\n  * Guides\n\n## FOLLOW\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n  * About\n  * Advertising\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.
