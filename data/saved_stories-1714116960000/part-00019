At this important juncture in my personal\nand professional life, I hope you will let me indulge in some nostalgia and\npride _.\n\nIt\u2019s been 23 years since Mike and I started Atlassian, fresh out of\nuniversity. We got to work on the heels of the dot com bust and unbeknownst to\nus, we were kickstarting the Australian tech industry. We started what is now\nknown as \u2018Product Led Growth\u2019 by selling business software online with no\nsalespeople, and 23 years later, we continue to innovate by leading the world\nas the largest company committed to remote work with Team Anywhere.\n\nToday, rockets don\u2019t launch into orbit without Atlassian\u2019s software . From\nhelping to land the Mars Rover, to ensuring cars roll off the production line\nand Domino\u2019s pizzas are delivered on time, to life-saving medical procedures\nbeing tracked and managed in hospitals, our solutions are woven into the\nfabric of teamwork worldwide. We\u2019re unleashing the potential of teams in every\ncorner of the world (and beyond!).\n\nAnd while there is never a perfect time to make this change, I take comfort in\nmy decision knowing Atlassian is so well placed for the future. We have a\nworld-class cloud platform and the best team we\u2019ve ever had. Our new Point A\nproducts are gaining real traction, AI is providing new and exciting\nopportunities, and we have over 300,000 cloud customers consolidating around\nAtlassian.\n\nThere are very few companies in the world that can play (and win) in the huge\nmarkets we do, with the incredible opportunities at our feet. The future has\nnever looked brighter .\n\nBeyond the outward impact, it\u2019s Atlassian\u2019s soul that brings me the most joy.\nPeople say there\u2019s something special about this place \u2013 something hard to put\nyour finger on. Atlassians really, truly, deeply care about each other and for\ndoing the right thing for one another, for our customers, and for the planet.\n\nAs for me, I\u2019m looking forward to spending some time with my young family,\nimproving the world via philanthropy with Skip Foundation and Pledge 1%,\ninvesting with Skip Capital, as well as mentoring other tech CEOs.\n\nMy last day as co-CEO will be Aug 31, 2024, and after that, I will remain a\nboard member and a special advisor.\n\nFinally, while there will be plenty of time for long thank yous and goodbyes\nover the next four months, I can\u2019t let this opportunity go by without\nrecognising and thanking my co-founder Mike. Mike, it\u2019s hard to put into words\nthe gratitude I feel, and my love for all we have created together. You really\nare George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Unreasonable Man, and the world and I are better as\na result .\n\n\u2013 Scott\n\nAbout this Article\n\nPublished April 25, 2024\n\nAbout the Author\n\nScott Farquhar Co-Founder and Co-CEO\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * Pocket\n  * Email\n\nRelated Content\n\n### More in Company News\n\nCompany News\n\n#### Our Q3 FY24 letter to shareholders\n\nCompany News\n\n#### The journey of a lifetime\n\nCompany News\n\n#### Presenting our new Atlassian Customer Agreement\n\nCompany News\n\n#### Atlassian welcomes the European Union\u2019s AI Act\n\n#### More Collections\n\nCollection\n\n### Wellbeing at Work\n\nLaying the groundwork for better employee health and happiness.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Remote Work\n\nWork-from-home tips and ideas, from our team to yours.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Company Culture\n\nEmbrace transparency, foster a sense of belonging, form connections \u2013 and have\nfun along the way.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Wellbeing at Work\n\nLaying the groundwork for better employee health and happiness.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Remote Work\n\nWork-from-home tips and ideas, from our team to yours.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Company Culture\n\nEmbrace transparency, foster a sense of belonging, form connections \u2013 and have\nfun along the way.\n\nView Collection\n\nCollection\n\n### Wellbeing at Work\n\nLaying the groundwork for better employee health and happiness.\n\nView Collection\n\n#### The journey of a lifetime\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * Pocket\n  * Email\n\nJoin over 80,000 working professionals\n\nBy Atlassian\n\nCulture, tech, teams, and tips, delivered twice a month\n\n  * Atlassian.com\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Atlassian\n\nThis site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience, perform analytics\nand research, and conduct advertising.
