The integration\nis available in Postman Enterprise plans with the Advanced Security\nAdministration add-on and can be accessed in the Postman Canary release. It\nwill be available in the stable build in the coming weeks.\n\nPostman is the leading API platform used by more than 30 million developers to\nbuild and work with APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle\nand streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs, faster.\n\nThe team at Postman was an early partner and tester in the 1Password SDKs\nprivate beta, and built the new integration with 1Password using the 1Password\nJavascript SDK. Developers can use the SDKs to securely retrieve secrets\nstored in 1Password natively in their apps, whether integrating with an API,\naccessing infrastructure secrets, or building their own integrations with\n1Password.\n\n## How it works\n\nFirst, create a service account using 1Password.com or 1Password CLI. We\nrecommend saving the service account token into one of your 1Password vaults\nto reference later. (Note: 1Password Business users may need to ask their\naccount administrator to set up a service account with access to shared\nvaults.)\n\nNext, head over to Postman Vault and start adding a vault secret. Give it an\nappropriate name (under the Key column) and then click the Vault Integration\nIcon in the Value field.\n\nChoose 1Password from the dropdown and enter your 1Password Service Account\ntoken.\n\nNow you can configure your secret by copying the 1Password Secret Reference\nfor the API key or other secret stored in 1Password. The secret reference is\nof the form op://<vault-name>/<item-name>[/<section-name>]/<field-name>.\n\nYou can reference vault secrets in your Postman collections and requests from\nthe URL builder, the Params tab, the Authorization tab, the Headers tab, and\nthe Body tab.\n\nEnclose the vault secret in double curly braces ({{ }}) and prefix the secret\nname with vault: to reference it throughout your Postman team. For example, to\nreference a secret named \u201copenai-api-key\u201d, use the following syntax:\n{{vault:openai-api-key}}.\n\n## Improving API security and collaboration\n\nAPIs are the connective tissue of modern applications. By some estimates up to\n83% of internet traffic is from APIs. Unfortunately, this can also make them\nappealing targets for malicious actors. Multiple high-profile breaches over\nthe past year illustrate the importance of protecting API keys.\n\nBy providing an integrated vault experience, Postman and 1Password help\nstreamline and secure developer workflows, ensuring APIs are protected every\nstep of the way:\n\n  * Available everywhere: You can sync and access your Postman workspace on every device without having to set up access to your API keys and secrets again. Whenever you need to make an API request, your API keys will be available in Postman.\n  * Easier collaboration: Teams that collaborate in a workspace can easily reproduce each other\u2019s requests without additional setup. If they use a shared vault in 1Password to share access secrets, they can easily reproduce requests without any additional configuration.\n  * Reduced security gaps: Secrets are end-to-end encrypted in 1Password so no one else can access them \u2013 including Postman and 1Password. This helps secure secrets and prevents them from accidentally leaking in configuration files or other plaintext files saved to your local disk.\n\n## Build your own integration with 1Password SDKs\n\nPostman was one of our first partners to test and build with the new 1Password\nSDKs for Golang, Javascript, and Python. Currently in private beta, 1Password\nSDKs provide native language functionality to access and work with secrets\nstored in 1Password encrypted vaults.\n\n\u201cThe 1Password SDK takes the hassle out of integrating 1Password Vault into\nyour app,\u201d says Pranav Joglekar, Software Engineer at Postman. \u201cWith a\nstreamlined setup process, it\u2019s up and running in no time. So, we (developers)\ncan focus on building amazing apps while the 1Password SDK handles the rest,\nimproving overall efficiency.\u201d\n\nWhether you\u2019re building an integration, or just want to securely make an API\nrequest in your code, you can use 1Password SDKs to access secrets stored in\nyour 1Password vaults.\n\nSign up for the 1Password Developer Newsletter or join the 1Password Developer\nSlack Community for updates about the public beta, and for the latest product\nupdates and news for developers from 1Password.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see what you build!\n\n### Secure your workflows with 1Password Developer Tools\n\nStreamline how you manage SSH keys, API tokens, and other infrastructure\nsecrets from your first line of code all the way into production.\n\nExplore documentation\n\nSimon Barendse and Andrew Stiefel\n\n#### Tweet about this post\n\n#### Continue Reading\n\n### Developer secrets keep leaking.
