Should all of the new features make it to the\nrelease candidate stage, users will be treated to a new user interface (UI)\nfor customizing popular page controls, a \"Web eraser\" feature, and AI-driven\ncontent summarization tools.\n\n## Intelligent Search - AI-enhanced browsing and text summarization\n\nEngineers evaluating the latest builds of Safari 18 can find a toggle for the\nnew page controls menu within the browser's address bar. The menu consolidates\n\u2014 and provides quick access to \u2014 old and new page control tools, among them\nbeing the browser's new \"Intelligent Search\" feature.\n\nSafari's new intelligent browsing feature could mimic features like Arc\nBrowser's article summary\n\nThis feature is not automatically enabled in test builds of Safari 18 and\ninstead requires manual activation from the page controls menu. Once enabled,\nit's believed the tool leverages Apple's on-device AI technology \u2014\nspecifically the Ajax language-learning model \u2014 to identify topics and key\nphrases within a webpage for which to base the summarization.\n\nWatch the Latest from AppleInsider TV\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nThe M3 MacBook Air is the BEST MAC for EVERYBODY!\n\nShare\n\nNext\n\nStay\n\nIn selecting key phrases, Apple's LLM software identifies sentences that\nprovide explanations or describe the structure of objects, depending on the\ntext in question. Words repeated within a text and key sentences are\nrecognized as text topics.\n\nThese early indications suggest Apple is striving to deliver text\nsummarization alongside Safari 18 later this year, though the exact\nimplementation of this feature remains fuzzy.\n\nApple's text summarization features could be a response to rival generative AI\ntools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. But Apple's on-device models and technologies\nlike Private Relay could make the experience much more secure for users.\nIntelligent Search is also likely to be the same AI browser assistant that one\nX user hinted at a couple of weeks back.\n\n## Web Eraser for better content-blocking\n\nAlso accessible from the new page controls menu is a feature Apple is testing\ncalled \"Web Eraser.\" As its name would imply, it's designed to allow users to\nremove, or erase, specific portions of web pages, according to people familiar\nwith the feature.\n\nThe feature is expected to build upon existing privacy features within Safari\nand will allow users to erase unwanted content from any webpage of their\nchoosing. Users will have the option to erase banner ads, images, text or even\nentire page sections, all with relative ease.\n\nErase parts of a webpage by blocking specific HTML like an existing feature in\n1Blocker\n\nThe erasure is said to be persistent, rather than limited to a browsing\nsession. This means that Safari will remember the changes even after the\noriginal tab or window has been closed.\n\nWhen visiting a web page with previously erased content, Safari will inform\nthe user that the page has been modified to reflect their desired changes. The\nbrowser will also give the user the option to revert changes and restore the\nwebpage to its initial, unaltered state.\n\nAs for where Apple got the inspiration for Web Eraser, the company could have\nSherlocked the feature from the third-party app 1Blocker. The application\nfeatures a similar way of erasing ads, where users would tap ads to make them\ndisappear.\n\n## Updated UI will move key tools into one easy location\n\nThe new page controls menu referenced throughout this article will attempt to\noffer Safari 18 users quick and easy access to several options previously\nlocated across different menus and the Share Sheet. Running on pre-release\nversions of macOS 15, for instance, the menu also pulls in the \"Aa\" menu\ncommon on existing iPadOS versions of the browser. These include zoom options,\nwebpage settings for privacy controls, content blocking options, extension\nshortcuts, and access to the new AI and erasure tools.\n\nThe new Safari menu will feature easier access to multiple features previously\nfound in the Share Sheet and Address Bar\n\nThese various options existed previously on macOS, but were found by\nnavigating through the Safari settings menu. Having all of these controls in\none central location in the Address Bar will make these options more\ndiscoverable for end users. Other options like on-page text search and reader\nmode are also in this menu.\n\nThis all suggests Apple intends to unite the iPadOS and macOS Safari UI\nparadigms when it unveils its new OS releases during its Worldwide Developers\nConference in June.\n\n## AI-enhanced Visual Lookup feature could be available in 2025\n\nSimultaneously, Apple is also working on a much more powerful visual search\nfeature scheduled for integration sometime in 2025 that will allow users to\nobtain information on consumer products when browsing through images. People\nfamiliar with the tool say it's similar to the Visual Lookup feature, through\nwhich Siri can identify plants, pets and landmarks from photos.\n\nVisual Lookup could get an AI boost and become available across iOS\n\nVisual Search could be implemented as a system-wide feature. So, instead of\nsurfacing search results in the Photos app, the user may be able to use Visual\nSearch directly in Safari by selecting an image.\n\nGiven development of this tool is in the earlier stages, it remains unclear\nhow Apple will ultimately go about implementing it. It also remains to be seen\nwhether or not the feature will make it through internal testing.\n\nThe iPhone maker has expressed significant interest in artificial intelligence\nand more recently published research related to on-device language learning\nmodels. This goes hand in hand with widespread rumors about several other AI-\npowered software features, many of which are expected to make their debut\nlater this year with iOS 18.\n\n## Another big year for Safari\n\nFrom its inception, Safari was always meant to rival existing web browsers.\n\nFeatures like built-in password tools make Safari an excellent browser option\n\nSafari was originally added to macOS as a means of replacing Microsoft's\nInternet Explorer for Mac, which was the default browser. Over the years, the\napp made its way to the iPhone, and has since received various upgrades over\nthe years.\n\nMore recent versions of Safari provide users with personalized web\nsuggestions, and allow for greater privacy protection with features such as\niCloud Private Relay.\n\nThis latest set of enhancements only serves to better position Safari against\nthe competition, in an ever-increasing landscape of generative AI tools and\nthird-party ad-blockers.\n\nWhile Apple tests many such features during different development stages, it\nis important to remember that not all of them make it to release. Apple has\nbeen known to delay features or cancel them entirely, so there's always a\nchance we may not see these new Safari features after all.\n\nAlong with Safari 18 and its associated improvements, we should also see a\nrevamped Calculator with Math Notes make its way to iPadOS 18. Freeform Scenes\nand Adaptive Voice Shortcuts are new OS features, which are also expected to\ndebut later this year.\n\nApple is expected to introduce various AI-related enhancements as part of iOS\n18 and macOS 15, both of which should be announced at the company's annual\nWWDC on June 10.\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\n16 Comments\n\n## 16 Comments\n\ngatorguy 24195 comments \u00b7 13 Years\n\nAbout 12 hours ago\n\n\"As for where Apple got the inspiration for Web Eraser, the company could have\nSherlocked the feature from the third-party app 1Blocker.
