While the default\nuse case (connect mobile via USB) is already useful (eg. for navigation), one\nmay look at AA headunits as a more generic input/output device.\n\nThis project attempts to provide a basic layer to access Android Auto\nheadunits as a video display and later maybe touchscreen, soundcard, etc.\n\nThis project attempts to be specific enough to provide a clear way to set it\nup. On the other hand it attempts to be generic enough by providing\nconnectivity to already existing software components.\n\n# Hardware\n\nThis software is being developed on Odroid N2 platform. Reasons behind\nchoosing this platform:\n\n  * has USB OTG controller\n  * powerful enough to process video\n  * reasonable form factor, power requirements and price\n\nIf you want to try out this piece of code and/or help just buy Odroid N2. I do\nnot have access to any other platform (ok, I tried BeagleBone Black, but it\nwas too slow) so it would be extremely hard for me to provide any support.\nHowever, feel free to provide patches for other platforms.\n\n# System\n\nThe software is being developed on:\n\n  * latest (as of this writing) stable version of Ubuntu (19.10)\n  * kernel 5.x - stock 4.9.x version has issues with gadget support\n  * latest git version of libusbgx (https://github.com/kopasiak/libusbgx or upstream at: https://github.com/libusbgx/libusbgx)\n\n# Installation\n\nInstructions how to set up runtime and development environment can be found in\nthe installation instructions document.\n\n# Design\n\nAndroid Auto Protocol is not documented. However, it has been reverse\nengineered and open source implementation exists (see\nhttps://github.com/opencardev/openauto). While this code does not use a single\nline from openauto (except for headunit key/cert), openauto is extremenly\nuseful while developing and testing AACS.\n\nThere are several components that comprise AACS:\n\n  * AAServer is the component responsible for communication with car's headunit. When USB OTG connection is available AAServer starts Android Auto communication with headunit and start listening on a Unix socket for client connections.\n  * AAClient is the component responsible for communication with mobile device running Andoid Auto. It starts connection to AAServer to get available service description and then forwards all the traffic to AAServer.\n  * GetEvents is a small tool that listens for touch events from AAServer and uses XTest to forward them to specified application.\n  * more to come - several more components integrating AACS with generic system components are possible such as GStreamer audio sink, audio/video source, etc.\n\nAACS depends on Snowmix for video mixing.\n\n# Usage ideas\n\nSo what exactly could be displayed on headunit? Here are a few ideas:\n\n  * any Android application, including any offline navigation, eg. using https://anbox.io/\n  * video from camera using GStreamer's video4linux2 plugin\n  * any graphical Linux application (using GStreamer's ximagesrc plugin)\n\n# Status\n\nCurrently AACS can do the following:\n\n  * it can act as proxy for Android Auto traffic,\n  * stream any video content to the headunit,\n  * ...stay tuned for more.\n\n## About\n\nAndroid Auto Server encapsulates communication with modern car infotainment\nsystem\n\n### Topics\n\ngstreamer communication android-auto headunit aacs openauto android-automotive\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nGPL-3.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n214 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n26 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n28 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\n1 tags\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 6\n\n## Languages\n\n  * C++ 83.9%\n  * Lua 5.9%\n  * Shell 4.7%\n  * CMake 4.4%\n  * C 1.1%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
