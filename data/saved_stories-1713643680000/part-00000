It might not be a majestic AGI that solves\nall the humanity problems, but it still powers lots of industries and\nactivities, and thus companies and governments that provide AI solutions have\ntremendous resources.\n\nNow, the companies training new and more powerful models run into the problem:\nthere is not enough data for this task.\n\nSo what do they do, besides synthesizing data for training and performing\nother clever tricks? They extend the sources of real, high quality data of\ncourse!\n\nNow imagine that everyone can get a pair of new XR glasses. They are so\nfunctional, versatile and useful that you cannot even think of your life\nwithout them! All influencers wear these fancy devices, there are\ncollaborations with clothing brands suitable for any audience. Also, they are\ndirty cheap.\n\nWhat makes the glasses so cheap you could ask? Maybe ads that are shoveled\nright into your eyes? Or governmental Big Brother that sees you and controls\nwhat you say? Nope, though the second option is somewhat close.\n\nThe price comes with the condition to share all you see, hear and say while\nwearing the device with one of the Big Tech companies (in anonymized,\nabsolutely safe, privacy-conscious way). They use your data to train the AIs\nand AIs become better to improve the society wellbeing. So you don\u2019t only get\na beautiful functional product and services for almost free, you also help the\nhumanity! Together with 7 billion other people who wear glasses as well.\n\nDo you like this vision of the future? I\u2019m sure you do. So we can use some\nmore imagination to ask ourselves additional questions about such world. For\nexample, if most people wear XR glasses and minority does not, what does it\nmean? Are the ones who refuse wearing them are considered as just harmless\nweirdos, or are they evil criminals?\n\nOr, another interesting one: are all the people equal in regards of their\n\u201cusefulness\u201d for data training? Is it possible that things many people see,\nhear and say are so generic and typical, that their \u201clife logs\u201d are almost\nuseless for AI models? The models already trained on similar experiences and\ndo not benefit from more of them. If this is the case, then naturally, there\nwill be a category of \u201cmore useful\u201d people who have unusual lives and share\nrare thoughts. Probably any company wants to have more such users and somehow\nincentivizes them to use particular devices. Do we actually see that these\npeople are more special with some kind of open ILS (interesting/impactful life\nscore)?\n\nOne more thing coming to mind is that not all experiences people share might\nbe \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cmoral\u201d. But probably they can be very useful from the practical\npoint of view. So, is there a black or gray market for such data?\n\nAnd of course, considering the fact that over time our AI training data\nbecomes bigger, there is an inflation of experiences. I.e. every year there\nare fewer things that companies consider unique and of high quality. People\nmight get upset about this inflation especially if it affects their social\nstatus.\n\nI guess there could be a nice short story written about such world as it\u2019s\ninteresting to think about life in it. And I also think it would be nice if we\nwould stop at only imagining it rather than living it in the future. This\nworld definitely looks better than The Matrix where people were just numb\nphysical batteries for machines, but I would say still not very pleasant. Will\nsee what happens next.\n\nAll images in the post are generated by meta.ai\n\n### Subscribe to Thoughts\n\nBy Oleksii \u00b7 Launched 2 years ago\n\nabout thoughts\n\n1 Like\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Imagine\n\nblog.lwoleksii.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nRethinking Descriptive Camera in the age of AI\n\nHow Implai app appeared\n\nOct 30, 2023 \u2022\n\nOleksii\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Rethinking Descriptive Camera in the age of AI\n\nblog.lwoleksii.com\n\nCEO Copilot\n\nPersonalized copilot for managing your company\n\nApr 30, 2023 \u2022\n\nOleksii\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### CEO Copilot\n\nblog.lwoleksii.com\n\nLEGO For Two\n\nOn \"multiplayer\" Lego sets\n\nMay 7, 2022 \u2022\n\nOleksii\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### LEGO For Two\n\nblog.lwoleksii.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Oleksii\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
