However,\nyou still need to make sure your potential customers feel comfortable with\nthat.\n\nBefore pressing the record button, it's crucial to seek consent from all\nparticipants. Not only does this foster a sense of trust and transparency\namong attendees, but it's also the ethical course of action. Furthermore,\ndepending on your location and the applicable laws, obtaining explicit\npermission may be a legal requirement.\n\n## Asking Permission Before Recording\n\nFor a smooth and respectful recording process, we recommend waiting until\nafter you've obtained consent from everyone to hit record. This ensures\ntransparency and aligns with privacy regulations like GDPR.\n\nHere are example of how you can ask for permission:\n\n  * \u201cI like to record my meetings so I can focus on our conversation instead of taking notes. Is that okay with you?\u201d\n  * \"Would it be alright if I recorded this session for anyone to reference later?\"\n  * \u201cIs it fine if I start the recording? It will help me to keep all the important information that we discussed\u201d\n  * \u201cI would like to record the meeting for learning porpuses. Is it ok for you?\u201d\n  * \u201cBefore we begin, I want to confirm that it's okay for me to record our conversation. May I proceed with recording?\u201d\n\n### Respecting Preferences\n\nIt's important to be mindful of everyone's comfort level. After requesting\npermission, take a moment to acknowledge any responses. If someone expresses\nhesitation or objects to the recording, respect their preference and proceed\nwithout recording. Remember, obtaining full consent is crucial.\n\nIf someone expresses discomfort with being recorded, you can respond by using\none of the two options below.\n\n#### Option 1: acknowledge and offer alternatives\n\n  * \"Absolutely, I understand and respect your preference. Would you prefer if I take detailed notes and share them with everyone after the meeting?\"\n  * \"No problem at all! The recording is mainly for reference, and we can certainly proceed without it. Would you still be interested in receiving a summary of the key points discussed?\"\n  * \"Thanks for letting me know. Creating a comfortable and inclusive environment is important.\"\n\n#### Option 2: explain flexibility and reiterate benefits\n\n  * \"No problem at all! The recording is mainly for reference, and we can certainly proceed without it. Would you still be interested in receiving a summary of the key points discussed?\"\n\n## Indications Of Recording A Meeting\n\nBeyond verbally requesting permission, consider these additional steps to\ninform your participants that a meeting is being recorded:\n\n  * Meeting chat message: Post a clear notification in the meeting chat at the beginning, stating the session is being recorded. (add image)\n  * Automated tools: Explore tools like Bluedot that can automate the process of sending recording notifications within your chosen platform.\n\nThese measures create a transparent environment and provide further assurance\nto participants about their awareness of the recording.\n\n## Consent After The Recording Starts\n\nTo be on a save side we would recommend to clarify that meeting is being\nrecorded second time. This way you have full protection since it\u2019s clearly\nrecorded that you asked for permission. You can use these examples:\n\n  * \"Alright, just a reminder that the meeting is now being recorded, and you should see the notification in the chat box. Following the meeting, you'll receive an email containing a summary and the recording.\"\n  * \"Excellent, the recording has begun. Could you please confirm that you're comfortable with this?\"\n  * \"Fantastic! The recording is underway, and I appreciate your confirmation. Let's proceed.\"\n\n## Sharing Recordings Post-Meeting\n\nAfter the meeting concludes, platforms like Bluedot can automatically share\nthe meeting recording and summary with participants. For continuous sharing of\nrecaps, simply select \"always share,\" and it will be done by default.\n\nAfter the meeting is shared, all participants will receive an email containing\na summary, action items, and a link to the video itself.\n\nUpon opening the link, participants will find a transcript, video, and AI-\ngenerated summary with action items.\n\nIn the next episode:\n\nHow to record a Google Meet meeting using Bluedot Extension\n\nTable of contents:\n\n\u2022Asking Permission Before Recording\n\n\u2022Indications Of Recording A Meeting\n\n\u2022Consent After The Recording Starts\n\n\u2022Sharing Recordings Post-Meeting\n\nBacked by\n\nTools\n\nTranscript Chrome extensionChrome Screen RecorderAI Note Taker For Google\nMeetChrome Audio CaptureEdit Google Meet\n\nSocial\n\nLinkedinYouTubeX\n\nResources\n\nBlogTemplatesAffiliate program\n\nCompany\n\nFor teamsPricingSecurity\n\nPress \ud83d\udd35 for better meetings\n\nPrivacy policyTerms of use\n\nBluedot \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
