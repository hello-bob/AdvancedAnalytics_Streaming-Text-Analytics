A well-\nchosen problem can isolate an essential difficulty in a particular area,\nserving as a benchmark against which progress in this area can be measured. It\nmight be like a 'marshmallow', serving as a tasty tidbit supplying a few\nmoments of fleeting enjoyment. Or it might be like an 'acorn', requiring deep\nand subtle new insights from which a mighty oak can develop. [...]\n\nIn this note I would like to describe a variety of my problems which I would\nclassify as my favorites. Of course, I can't guarantee that they are all\n'acorns', but because many have thwarted the efforts of the best\nmathematicians for many decades (and have often acquired a cash reward for\ntheir solutions), it may indicate that new ideas will be needed, which can, in\nturn, lead to more general results, and naturally, to further new problems.\n\nIn this way, the cycle of life in mathematics continues forever.\n\nPaul Erd\u0151s, Some of my favorite problems and results, 1997\n\nThere are 589 problems in the database of which 159 have been solved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
