Here\u2019s Why.\n\nHistorical data shows that the vast, vast majority of investments perform\npoorly.\n\nThis is true for bonds, stocks, and real estate as asset classes. Nearly all\nof it makes for a bad investment for outside passive investors.\n\nAnd what I\u2019ll show in this piece is that this is both normal and unavoidable.\nAnd unintuitively, I\u2019ll also show that it doesn\u2019t mean that most of those\ninvestments shouldn\u2019t have happened. But it does inform us a lot about how we\nshould try to invest as allocators of capital.\n\n## A History of Duds\n\nWhether we look at bonds, stocks, or real estate, the returns for most\ninvestments are bad. The top outliers account for most of the returns.\n\nWe can go through them one-by-one to quantify how bad they are:\n\nHistorical Bond Returns\n\nThe U.S. dollar was the second-best performing currency over the past century,\nsecond only to the Swiss franc. The United States was the largest economy in\nthe world throughout this period, and the dollar rose to become the world\nreserve currency during this time. And yet, holding U.S. government bonds\nduring their time of ascent and dominance underperformed simply holding gold.\n\nProfessor Aswath Damodaran maintains records of the performance of various\nassets classes going back to 1928. If you had invested $100 in T-bills\nstarting in 1928 and compounded them through 2023, you would have $2,249 by\nthe end of 2023. If you had taken more volatility risk and instead invested in\nlonger duration T-bonds, you would have turned $100 into $7,278.\n\nThat seems great at first, except for the fact that this is entirely due to\ndollar debasement along the way. If you had simply put $100 into gold, you\nwould have turned $100 into $10,042. The number of dollars in the U.S. broad\nmoney supply increased by more than 400x from 1928 through 2023.\n\nAnd gold holders were gradually diluted too. That\u2019s why they only had a 100x\nnominal gain rather than a 400x nominal gain which would be in line with the\nmoney supply growth. Every year, the global supply of refined gold increases\nby an estimated 1% to 2%, which gradually impacts a gold holder\u2019s purchasing\npower. If the supply of refined gold grows by an average of 1.5% per year,\nthen after 95 years the amount of refined gold on the market will have\nincreased by about 4x.\n\nAnd the math checks out; each unit of gold increased in dollar price by about\n100x, and there\u2019s about 4x as much of it, and so the market capitalization of\ngold increased by about 400x which is in line with the money supply growth.\n\nAs a result of this gradual dilution, over the long arc of time a gold\nholder\u2019s ability to purchase things like a barrel of oil has been pretty much\nflat, even as our ability to get oil out of the ground becomes better due to\nimproving technology. Here\u2019s the chart of the price of barrels of oil\ndenominated in ounces of gold:\n\nA gold holder\u2019s purchasing power gradually increases for things that we get\nexponentially better at making. A gold coin can buy more agricultural products\ntoday than it could a century ago, and more electronics, and more shoes.\n\nBut it\u2019s not because gold appreciated, and indeed gold was gradually diluted.\nIt\u2019s just that gold was diluted at a slightly slower rate than human\ntechnology/productivity increased in aggregate, and so a gold holder\nmaintained or gradually increased her purchasing power over time in practice.\nAnd she beat government bonds denominated in the world reserve currency, let\nalone every other currency.\n\nHistorical Stock Returns\n\nMultiple studies over the years have shown that a tiny percentage of equities\nmake up virtually all returns in equity markets.\n\nProfessor Hendrik Bessembinder compiled some of the most comprehensive\ndatasets on this phenomenon.\n\nFor his U.S. study, he found that among 26,000 identified stocks between 1926\nand 2019, more than half failed to outperform T-bills. But the reality is even\nworse than that. Just 4% of all stocks accounted for basically all stock\nmarket returns in excess of T-bills; the other 96% of stocks collectively\nmatched T-bills as a group. And just 86 stocks accounted for half of all\nexcess returns.\n\nIn other words, the majority of U.S. stocks historically underperformed\nT-bills, and then another big minority of stocks generated only minor excess\nreturns over T-bills, and then a very small sliver of massive outperformers\nrepresented nearly all stock market excess returns over T-bills. And as the\nprevious section showed, T-bills underperformed gold. And so, the vast\nmajority of stocks failed to outperform the purchasing power of a piece of\nyellow metal.\n\nAnd that\u2019s for the United States, which had the best-performing stocks of the\npast century. For non-U.S. equities, the numbers are even worse. For his\nglobal study, Bessembinder studied 64,000 stocks from across the world over a\nthree-decade period and found an incredible concentration of returns:\n\n> We study long-run shareholder outcomes for over 64,000 global common stocks\n> during the January 1990 to December 2020 period. We document that the\n> majority, 55.2% of U.S. stocks and 57.4% of non-U.S. stocks, underperform\n> one-month U.S. Treasury bills in terms of compound returns over the full\n> sample. Focusing on aggregate shareholder outcomes, we find that the top-\n> performing 2.4% of firms account for all of the $US 75.7 trillion in net\n> global stock market wealth creation from 1990 to December 2020. Outside the\n> US, 1.41% of firms account for the $US 30.7 trillion in net wealth creation.\n\nU.S. stocks as a group were among the best possible investments. Investing in\nthe top 500 U.S. companies, and rotating them as necessary to maintain those\ntop 500 as they join and leave that group over time, would have turned $100 in\n1928 to over $787,000 through 2023 according to Professor Damodaran\u2019s data.\nBut as previously shown, that\u2019s because a tiny percentage of them created\nenormous value while the majority failed to keep up with gold.\n\nThe international results were less stellar. And if Bessembinder had been able\nto run his international numbers for the longer 1926-2019 period then they\nwould have been even worse. A large number of stock markets were completely\nnullified in their entirety at one point or another, due to the outbreak of\nwar or a shift toward communism. Even the stock markets that made it through\nthe past century intact generally underperformed the U.S. stock market.\n\nHistorical Real Estate Returns\n\nReal estate has long been known as a good long-term investment. But is it?\n\nProfessor Aswath Damodaran\u2019s records show that $100 invested into U.S. real\nestate in 1928 would have turned into $5,360 by 2023. That\u2019s better than\nT-bills, but worse than T-bonds and worse than gold. If an investor levered it\nup they would have done much better, but we\u2019ll get to that topic later.\n\nTo double-check this data, we can check Professor Robert Shiller\u2019s dataset on\nreal estate that goes back to 1890. His data shows that the nominal home price\nindex increased by 88x from 1890 to the present. Meanwhile, the price of a\nunit of gold increased by 123x during that period. If the homeowner/landowner\npaid a small maintenance rate each year, as well as a recurring property tax\neach year, then the gap between those two numbers would have been even wider.\n\nOf course, some real estate has performed very well. If someone bought\nManhattan land at the turn of the 20th century, or land in Silicon Valley at\nthe start of the venture era, those bets really paid off. Those were top\npercentile real estate performances.\n\nBut in contrast, significant amounts of real estate goes to zero if the city\nthey are near decreases in population and economic activity. For example,\nthere are abandoned properties all around Detroit. These are large once-\nexpensive homes that are now rotting on parcels of land that nobody wants. And\nreal estate can\u2019t be moved if the economic situation or political situation in\na region becomes untenable.\n\nMost real estate falls somewhere between those extremes. It performs decently,\nespecially when considering that it can replace the owner\u2019s rental income or\nbe rented out for cashflows, but after maintenance and taxes are considered,\nits unlevered total return from price appreciation and cashflow generation net\nof maintenance leaves something to be desired relative to gold.\n\nAnd this mediocre performance in unlevered real estate occurred despite the\nmassive population increase that occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nAlthough rural and suburban residential land is rather abundant, if someone\nbought land in a good neighborhood near a city that grew substantially, their\ninvestment likely did well. But as population growth cools off, so do real\nestate prices. In Japan, there are millions of abandoned countryside homes\nthat are nearly free. Many of them are in beautiful and safe rural areas, and\nyet there is insufficient demand for them. They have varying states of\nquality, but in aggregate they are now deteriorating due to abandonment.\n\nPutting this all together, literally all government bonds have underperformed\ngold over the long run, and most unlevered real estate has underperformed gold\nas well. Stocks as an asset class greatly outperform gold, but only because\nthe top 4% of them in the best-performing market do all the heavy lifting\nwhile the other 96% as a group don\u2019t generate any excess returns.\n\n## Owner-Operators are the Winners\n\nThe numbers shown in the prior section are rather disastrous at face value;\nthe vast majority of investments underperform gold. Does that mean they\nshouldn\u2019t have been made in the first place?\n\nThe answer, especially for stocks and real estate, is that a lot of those\ninvestments actually made sense to do. But not necessarily for outside passive\ninvestors.\n\nA big expense for companies consists of salaries for workers. This includes\nsalaries for the founders and executives as well. And a young company is often\nowned by the founder/president.\n\nIf a reasonably successful company goes through its entire lifecycle from\nbirth to death and fails to outperform T-bills or gold, it doesn\u2019t usually\nmean that the company shouldn\u2019t have existed at all. Along the way, it\nsustained salaries and work for many people, including the founders and\nexecutives and salaried employees. It provided products and/or services to\ncustomers, which improved overall human productivity and quality of life.\n\nThese businesses were often great for owner-operators and employees, and for\ncustomers, but not for outside passive investors.\n\nBeing an owner-operator of a business, or a worker at a business, makes a lot\nof sense. However, the vast majority of businesses are not strong enough to\nprovide good returns for outside passive investors after all expenses\n(including salaries) are considered.\n\nGood returns for outside passive investors are reserved for only the best\ntypes of companies; companies that are so dominant and high-margin that even\nafter paying all of their executives and workers, they have plenty of excess\nprofits for outside passive investors. Although stocks from any sector can\nhave these characteristics, Bessembinder\u2019s research found that major\noutperformers were disproportionally concentrated in the technology,\ntelecommunications, energy, and healthcare/pharmaceutical sectors. They are on\nthe right side of an emerging tech trend, they have network effects, they have\neconomies of scale, they have protected intangible property such as patents,\nor they are part of an oligopoly, and so forth.\n\nReal estate generally rewards owner-operators as well. As a real estate\ninvestor that owns cashflow-producing properties, the more work that you\noutsource, especially if the property is unlevered, the less likely there is\nto be excess profits for you above the rate of just holding gold. Unlevered\ncap rates of cashflow-producing properties tend to be quite low. However,\nsomeone who takes time to study different property markets, invest into select\nproperties using leverage, build them or fix them up and selectively hire or\ncontract people to help him, and then re-sell the homes or rent them out, can\nearn a good living from that activity. It\u2019s his time and attention that is\nadding value and generating returns.\n\nSo the first answer to the question of why most businesses or real estate\ninvestments provide weak returns and yet still make sense to exist, is that\nyou have to look at them from the perspective of owner-operators and workers\n(i.e. the inside active participants), not for outside passive investors. And\nthe second answer has to do with leverage.\n\n## Turning Mediocrity into Wealth via Leverage\n\nHistorically, a key way to turn mediocre investments into good investments has\nbeen to apply leverage. That\u2019s not a recommendation; that\u2019s a historical\nanalysis, and it comes with survivorship bias.\n\nWhen leverage is used outside of certain contexts, it usually turns out\ndisastrously. A lot of famous investors have well-known quotes about how\nleverage isn\u2019t needed, and yet when you look at how they operate and what they\nbuy, they typically do use leverage. In many cases, leverage is built into an\ninvestment itself, or held through multiple layers.\n\nWhen you use leverage to own an investment (such as a business or some real\nestate), you\u2019re borrowing (i.e. shorting) the abundant fiat currency and using\nit to buy things that have some degree of scarcity to them relative to that\ncurrency (such as decent businesses and properties).\n\nWhen leverage improves a mediocre investment for outside passive investors,\nwhat\u2019s really happening is that their fiat currency short is a good\ninvestment. And since leverage is dangerous, there are only a handful of ways\nto deploy large amounts of leverage safely. The mediocre investment in this\ncontext mainly serves as a decent platform for investors to attach a fiat\ncurrency short to, and then arbitrage a profit out of that difference.\n\nDebt and Bonds\n\nLarge amounts of bonds are bought by banks or other levered entities. They\nborrow from depositors at a low interest rate for their liability side, while\ntheir asset side consists of higher-yielding and longer-duration loans and\nsecurities, including government bonds in many cases. Banks have historically\noften been levered around 10-to-1 or more.\n\nThis allows them to earn a high return on their capital. They profit greatly\nfrom the spread between the rate they borrow from depositors at and the rate\nthey lend at or the rate they own securities at.\n\nOther financial institutions engage in similar leveraging, where they use\ngovernment bonds as collateral for loans, or other similar arrangements.\n\nDebt and Real Estate\n\nReal estate is the most leverageable asset for most investors. Within the\ncontext of the fiat currency system, it has been both quantifiably workable\nand socially acceptable to own real estate with 5-to-1 or even 10-to-1\nleverage. People who are not professional investors will routinely put 20%\ndown and borrow 80% of the value of a home, with various options to increase\nthat to 10/90 in some cases, because we set up our financial system around\nthis being a normal thing to do.\n\nThis occurs for a couple reasons. One is that real estate on average is less\nvolatile than equities. A second is that it is much less liquid; a house gets\nappraised less frequently than a stock does, and there are significant costs\nof both time and money to buy or sell a house and to move from one house to\nanother. As a result of these two things, real estate debt is generally not\ncall-able, meaning that as long as she is making payments on time, a mortgage\nborrower doesn\u2019t get liquidated and become forced to sell her house if the\nhouse price dips below the borrowed amount, which would be the case for most\nother types of leveraged collateral.\n\nAfter maintenance and recurring taxes, the majority of unlevered real estate,\neven when rented out for cashflows, doesn\u2019t outperform gold. But unlike gold,\n5-to-1 leverage makes real estate actually pretty good in many contexts, and\nhistorically allows it to outperform gold. Real estate\u2019s reputation as\nbuilding wealth has been well-deserved in practice due to this fact. And of\ncourse, the true winning combination has been to own the top-decile performing\nproperties and lever them.\n\nDebt and Stocks\n\nLarge corporations do the same thing as real estate investors, but at lower\nrates of leverage.\n\nIf a company is successful enough to become one of the largest thousand\ncompanies around, they tend to have excellent access to corporate bond\nmarkets. They can borrow large amounts of money for decades at low interest\nrates, and use that capital to organically expand their business, buy smaller\ncompanies, or buy back their own shares. Either way, they are borrowing\nabundant fiat currency at low rates and using that capital to build or buy\nbusiness equity, and they are arbitraging that spread for shareholders.\n\nConsider Procter & Gamble (PG) for example. The company was founded in 1837,\nand has been profitable virtually every year for decades straight. And yet\nthey have over $30 billion in debt. Why? Because they\u2019re using that debt for\nthe purpose of financial arbitrage. It\u2019s how they improve equity returns. They\nissue bonds with durations of ten or twenty years in many cases, and\nhistorically at very low interest rates that are nearly as low as government\nborrowing rates. And they use those proceeds to make acquisitions or buy back\ntheir own shares. As their debt matures, they refinance it into more debt.\nThey voluntarily keep tens of billions of debt on their books on a permanent\nbasis because it\u2019s a permanent fiat currency short.\n\nMany of Procter & Gamble\u2019s bonds were issued when rates were below 1% or 2%.\nThose are long-term fiat currency shorts, and they were some of the best\ninvestments that the company ever made:\n\nYou can think of it in the following terms. In developed markets, the broad\nmoney supply historically grows by 6-9% per year on average. In the United\nStates that figure has been around 7% per year on average over the long term.\nIf a real estate investor or a corporation can borrow at 1% or 3% or 5% rates\nin that context, then their borrowing rate is less than the money supply\ngrowth rate. The buyer of those bonds gets diluted over time relative to the\ngrowth of the money supply, while the seller of those bonds has effectively\nshorted them, and can deploy the capital into scarcer things like equity and\nproperty.\n\nA lot of blue-chip companies do this. They have among the lowest cost access\nto debt in the world, and so they use it. Starting in 2013, Apple (AAPL) began\ntaking out $108 billion in low-interest debt and using it to buy back their\nown shares. They\u2019re the most successful company in modern financial history,\nand yet like everyone else, they began using debt as a strategic part of their\ncapital structure because they benefit from arbitraging the spread between 1)\nshorting abundant fiat currency and 2) buying scarcer things including their\nown equity.\n\nWarren Buffett and his company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) have taken this a\nstep further, by arbitraging an insurance float.\n\nInsurance companies take in customer premiums, and pay out customer claims. In\nbetween those two activities, they hold capital as a \u201cfloat\u201d and they\ntypically invest that float into bonds. An insurance company is leveraged in\nthis way, and its borrowing is basically in the form of a zero-rate loan from\nits customer premiums. In many cases, an insurance company will break even in\nterms of paying out as many claim dollars as it takes in dollars from\npremiums, but it makes a net profit anyway due to holding interest-bearing\nbonds with that zero-rate float.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is one of the biggest insurance companies in the world. But\nWarren Buffett deploys a sizable percentage of that float into stocks rather\nthan bonds. And the stocks he buys often use leverage as previously described.\nHe owns big stakes of companies like Apple, Procter & Gamble, Coca Cola (KO),\nChevron (CVX), Kraft Heinz (KHC), and many others. These are blue chip\ncompanies that purposely use a lot of low-rate corporate debt despite being\npersistently profitable companies. He also has historically invested in a lot\nof banks, which make use of leverage even more. And then Berkshire as a\ncorporation also issues long-term low-rate bonds, in addition to having\nleverage from its insurance float.\n\nSo Berkshire Hathaway is a big leveraged insurance company that borrows a lot\nof money at low rates and deploys that capital into companies who are also\nleveraged at low rates. For the full stack, there are multiple layers of low\ninterest rate borrowings built on top of one another, and that capital is\nredeployed into scarcer business equity and property. That spread, across all\nthose layers, creates tremendous wealth for people using this strategy\nrelative to those who are long currencies and bonds. Buffett makes sure to\nfocus on low-volatility long-term compounding stocks with economic moats to\ndeploy this strategy on, which keeps the risk in check.\n\nBerkshire has also made a habit out of buying small and medium sized private\nbusinesses in full. Many of these smaller companies would have higher\nborrowing costs if they were independent. But Berkshire can buy a lot of them,\nand then issue corporate debt at the parent company level at much lower\ninterest rates than any of them could issue on their own. So he can buy a lot\nof unlevered cashflow-producing small or medium-sized businesses, and turn\nthem into a portfolio of businesses that are levered with Berkshire\u2019s very low\ncost of capital.\n\nThis has been incredibly effective, because the larger it has become, the\nlower the cost of capital has become. Buffett understood this well from the\nstart, and reached critical mass with this strategy.\n\nA lot of Berkshire\u2019s wholly-owned businesses and stock positions would be\nsomewhat unremarkable if they were unlevered. But decent business operations,\nif their cashflows are stable enough, make excellent platforms to attach fiat\ncurrency shorts to. And a mediocre but reliable business with a long-term low-\ncost fiat currency short attached to it, has been an excellent investment.\n\nEven within the past few years, Berkshire borrowed a lot of yen at ultra-low\nrates, and used it to buy the Sogo shosha Japanese stocks, which have a lot of\nhard assets and positive cashflows (and which have their own yen-denominated\ncorporate debt as well). It was an excellent move; Buffett\u2019s company benefited\nboth from decent operations by the Sogo shosha stocks themselves, as well as\nthe spread between them and the rapidly devaluing yen short that was used to\nbuy them.\n\n## A Game of Financial Blackjack\n\nIn the card game of Blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible\nwith your cards, but without going over 21. If you go over, you automatically\nlose.\n\nOver the past four decades in particular, the global financial system has\nrewarded players of financial Blackjack. Entities that borrow money and use it\nto buy scarce assets, but in a prudent enough way that they are not among the\nfirst wave to blow up in a recession, have been the winners. You want\nleverage, but you don\u2019t want to \u201cgo over\u201d.\n\nThis has been a key contributor to growing wealth divide among individuals,\nand a key contributor to the performance gap between large and small\ncompanies. Larger and wealthier entities, as they grow larger and wealthier,\nget even better access to low cost capital, which gives them even more of an\nadvantage. It\u2019s a virtuous cycle for a while. Larger entities have access to\nlower costs of capital on a hard money system to some extent, but ever-\ndevaluing fiat currency is a supercharger for this trend because the arbitrage\nfrom having good access to credit is way bigger than it is with a hard money\nsystem.\n\nWithin the current financial system, those who do not use leverage generally\nlose. Those who leverage too much or too unskillfully and \u201cgo over\u201d also lose.\nBut those who leverage moderately and skillfully have been the winners. They\nenjoy a multi-trillion-dollar annual arbitrage by shorting abundant fiat\ncurrency for long durations at low interest rates and using it to buy scarcer\nbusiness equity or properties.\n\nIf you don\u2019t play the game as an investor, you usually lose because leverage\ndrives up the valuations for your potential investments. A key reason why cap\nrates on real estate are so low, is that so many people buy them with\nleverage. If there was no significant leverage available for them, then\nunlevered cap rates would need to be higher to incentivize the investment, but\nwith the existence of many people using leverage for them, it drives down the\ncap rates and makes them into typically low-returning investments for anyone\ndesiring to own cashflow-producing properties unlevered.\n\nAnd because it\u2019s a global game, the players have a huge gameboard to use this\nstrategy on. If one currency becomes too hard for this strategy to work, they\ncan make use of jurisdictional arbitrage and deploy their capital somewhere\nelse. There are approximately 160 fiat currencies out there. Dozens of them\nhave decent liquidity and capital markets. Investment firms can borrow (go\nshort) the yen and buy (go long) Brazilian assets. They can borrow (go short)\nthe euro and buy (go long) American assets. The permutations of this strategy\nhave been very abundant for decades.\n\nI say \u201cthey\u201d but of course I include myself here as well. I borrow American\ndollars or Egyptian pounds for multi-year durations at low rates and deploy it\ninto scarcer property. I own equities that borrow for long durations at low\nrates and deploy it into scarcer business equity. I benefit, both directly and\nindirectly, from the spread between shorting abundant fiat currency and\nlonging scarcer property and business equity. This has been the winning\nstrategy.\n\n## The Changing Game Rules\n\nThe properties of the fiat currency system have incentivized debt accumulation\nand the playing of this global game of financial Blackjack.\n\nFour decades of falling interest rates have been a huge tailwind for this\nstrategy, since debts could continually be refinanced at ever-lower rates, and\nincreasingly at rates that are very low relative to the rate of money supply\ngrowth. Additionally, large numbers of open capital markets in an increasingly\nconnected world have made it possible to arbitrage between jurisdictions as\nwell.\n\nNow, after interest rates bounced off zero in developed markets and may start\ngoing structurally sideways instead of structurally down, the effectiveness of\nthat strategy is likely to diminish.\n\nAnd as governments around the world increasingly have high debt at their\nsovereign level, they become increasingly incapable of sustaining high\npositive real yields for long periods of time, which makes it harder for them\nto convincingly fight inflation. Countries that face acute fiscal issues often\nturn to capital controls, which impairs the game of global financial\nBlackjack. It happened all the time in developed countries from the 1930s into\nthe 1970s, and still happens all the time more recently in various emerging\nmarkets.\n\n> High public debt often produces the drama of default and restructuring. But\n> debt is also reduced through financial repression, a tax on bondholders and\n> savers via negative or belowmarket real interest rates.

Whether it\u2019s kinetic wars or trade wars or financial\nwars, as large groups of countries increasingly have tensions between each\nother in terms of strategic interests and run into their own fiscal dominance\nissues, the frictions on global capital movement have a high likelihood of\nincreasing.\n\nSo, the effectiveness of this global financial Blackjack strategy is likely\ngoing to diminish, although entities that already locked their debt in for\nlong durations are potentially in a position to ride the momentum for quite a\nwhile longer.\n\nThe types of investments that worked well during the past four decades are\nless likely to work quite as well over the next four decades. The virtuous\ncycle of ever-lower interest rates, ever-higher private debt levels, and ever-\nhigher equity valuations, is likely getting past its prime, and is at risk of\nrolling over into a vicious cycle in the other direction.\n\nAnd in that shifting environment, it\u2019s important to remember that most\ninvestments are bad. The majority of unlevered businesses are not strong\nenough to produce returns for passive investors that outperform T-bills or\ngold. The majority of unlevered real estate properties, after maintenance and\noperation and taxes are considered, also fail to outperform basic assets like\ngold.\n\nSo in that environment, from the perspective of a passive outside investor\nlooking to deploy capital, it\u2019s important to either seek out the businesses\nthat have durable competitive advantages (network effects, powerful brands,\nintangible property, economies of scale, oligopoly participation, and so\nforth), or to be very sensitive to valuations when buying mediocre companies.\n\nThe prior four decades are unlikely to be a good dataset for back-testing and\nforming strategies that will work for next four decades, because the\nconditions will likely be quite different.\n\nAdditionally, hard monies become a serious alternative once again in this\ncontext, and are worth serious consideration for a portfolio slice, because\nthe hurdle rate for stocks to outperform them is high when there are not a lot\nof tailwinds at the backs of stocks.\n\nTweet\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\n#### Join the Free Investing Newsletter\n\nGet the insider newsletter, keeping you up to date on market conditions, asset\nallocations, undervalued sectors, and specific investment ideas every 6 weeks.\n\nNo spam, no nonsense.
