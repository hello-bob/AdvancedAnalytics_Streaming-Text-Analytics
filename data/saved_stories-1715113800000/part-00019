The photo published by the\ngovernment appears to answer that question quite affirmatively,\u201d Washington\nPost resident fact checker Philip Bump wrote on August 31, 2022.\n\nSome of Bump\u2019s colleagues were more hyperbolic. An ex-CIA officer told ABC\nNews the cover sheets indicated the highest level of secrecy, which in the\nwrong hands could have resulted in murder. \u201cPeople's lives are truly at stake.\nWithout being melodramatic, anything that helps an adversary identify a human\nsource means life and death,\" intelligence expert Douglas London\nmelodramatically warned in reaction to the photo.\n\nThe New York Times insisted the photo was consistent with how the FBI handles\ncriminal investigations. \u201c[It] is standard practice for the F.B.I. to take\nevidentiary pictures of materials recovered in a search to ensure that items\nare properly cataloged and accounted for. Files or documents are not tossed\naround randomly, even though they might appear that way; they are usually\nsplayed out so they can be separately identified by their markings,\u201d reporters\nGlenn Thrush and Adam Goldman wrote on August 31, 2022.\n\nExcept...that is not what happened.\n\n####\n\nA Stunt with Potentially Case-Killing Consequences for DOJ\n\nNew court filings in Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s espionage and obstruction\ncase against Trump and two co-defendants conclusively demonstrate that the\ngovernment used the cover sheets to deceive the public as well as the court.\nThe photo was a stunt, and one that adds more fuel to this dumpster-fire case.\n\nJay Bratt, who was the lead DOJ prosecutor on the investigation at the time\nand now is assigned to Smith\u2019s team, described the photo this way in his\nAugust 30, 2022 response to Trump\u2019s special master lawsuit:\n\n\u201c[Thirteen] boxes or containers contained documents with classification\nmarkings, and in all, over one hundred unique documents with classification\nmarkings...were seized. Certain of the documents had colored cover sheets\nindicating their classification status. (Emphasis added.) See, e.g.,\nAttachment F (redacted FBI photograph of certain documents and classified\ncover sheets recovered from a container in the \u201845 office\u2019).\u201d\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s clever wordsmithing, however, did not accurately describe the origin\nof the cover sheets. In what must be considered not only an act of doctoring\nevidence but willfully misleading the American people into believing the\nformer president is a criminal and threat to national security, agents\ninvolved in the raid attached the cover sheets to at least seven files to\nstage the photo.\n\nClassified cover sheets were not \u201crecovered\u201d in the container, contrary to\nBratt\u2019s declaration to the court. In fact, after being busted recently by\ndefense attorneys for mishandling evidence in the case, Bratt had to fess up\nabout how the cover sheets actually ended up on the documents.\n\nHere is Bratt\u2019s new version of the story, where he finally admits a critical\ndetail that he failed to disclose in his August 2022 filing:\n\n\u201c[If] the investigative team found a document with classification markings, it\nremoved the document, segregated it, and replaced it with a placeholder sheet.\nThe investigative team used classified cover sheets for that purpose.\u201d\n\nBut before the official cover sheets were used as placeholder, agents\napparently used them as props. FBI agents took it upon themselves to paperclip\nthe sheets to documents\u2014something evident given the uniform nature of how each\ncover sheet is clipped to each file in the photo\u2014laid them on the floor, and\nsnapped a picture for political posterity.\n\nThat raises many troubling questions, to say the least, about the FBI\u2019s\nhandling of the alleged incriminating documents.\n\nFor example, who made the on-site determination as to the classification level\nappropriate for each document? Did agents have security clearance and\nexpertise related to classification? Did the agents know whether the document\nhad been declassified by Trump while still in office?\n\nThe hasty assessment also appears to contradict Bratt\u2019s statements in court\nabout the classification status of the seized documents. Bratt told Judge\nAileen Cannon during a hearing last year that the records were undergoing a\nclassification review, presumably conducted by the intelligence community, to\ndetermine the correct level of secrecy.\n\nDid the final analysis confirm or dispute the assessments by the field FBI\nagents who conducted the raid?\n\n####\n\nMissing Paper Trial and Messy Boxes\n\nBut Jack Smith might have bigger problems. During the raid, agents took a box\nin its entirety if it contained papers with classified markings; the box\nusually contained other items, which is how the FBI ended up with so many of\nTrump\u2019s personal belongings.\n\nSo, in order to flag the location of the alleged classified record in the box,\nagents, as Bratt noted, used the cover sheets as placeholders. (The classified\nrecords were then placed in a separate secure file.)\n\nBut now defense attorneys claim, and the special counsel concedes, that some\nplaceholders do not match the relevant document. \u201cFollowing defense counsel\u2019s\nreview of the physical boxes...and the documents produced in classified\ndiscovery, defense counsel has learned that the cross-reference provided by\nthe Special Counsel\u2019s Office does not contain accurate information,\u201d attorneys\nrepresenting Trump\u2019s co-defendant Waltine Nauta wrote in a May 1 motion.\n\nThe motion forced the special counsel to admit the error. \u201cIn many but not all\ninstances, the FBI was able to determine which document with classification\nmarkings corresponded to a particular placeholder sheet,\u201d Bratt wrote.\n\nIn other words, in their zeal to stage a phony photo using official classified\ncover sheets, FBI agents might have failed to accurately match the placeholder\nsheet with the appropriate document. This is a potentially case-blowing\nmistake, particularly if the document in question is one of the 34 records\nthat represents the basis of espionage charges against Trump.\n\nAnd there is another issue in connection with the cover sheets. Defense\nattorneys also noted that in at least one instance, the location of the cover\nsheet in the physical box didn\u2019t match the FBI\u2019s accounting. \u201c[The]\nsheet...does not appear for several hundreds of pages later than the FBI Index\nindicated it would. Defense counsel\u2019s review of these materials calls into\nquestion the likelihood that the contents of the physical boxes remains (sic)\nthe same as when they were seized by the FBI on August 8, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhich Bratt also admitted is an issue. After the boxes were transported from\nFlorida to the hopelessly corrupt Washington FBI field office (another\nscandalous aspect of the case since the investigation should have been\nconducted in southern Florida not in another jurisdiction), a private company\ntook scans of the inside of the boxes. But according to the defense team, the\ncurrent condition of the boxes does not match the scans taken in August 2022.\n\nBratt explained that \u201cthere are some boxes where the order of items within\nthat box is not the same as in the associated scans.\u201d He then offered a list\nof excuses including how some \u201cboxes contain items smaller than standard paper\nsuch as index cards, books, and stationary, which shift easily when the boxes\nare carried, especially because many of the boxes are not full.\u201d\n\nIt is safe to assume Judge Cannon will not take these new revelations lightly\n--particularly since Bratt also had to admit in the same filing that he did\nnot tell her the truth when she asked about the condition of the boxes during\na hearing last month. On April 12, Cannon directly asked Bratt, \u201care the boxes\nin their original, intact form as seized?\u201d Bratt replied yes, but \u201cwith one\nexception, and that is that the classified documents have been removed and\nplaceholders have been put in the documents [place.]\u201d\n\nOof.\n\nIf a picture is worth a thousand words, Jack Smith\u2019s team might need several\nthousand words to weasel their way out of this mess.\n\nDeclassified with Julie Kelly is a reader-supported publication.
