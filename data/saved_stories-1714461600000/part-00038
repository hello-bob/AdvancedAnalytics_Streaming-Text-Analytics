Credit:\nMitch Zimmer/Western Science\n\nIt is a common hack to stretch a balloon out to make it easier to inflate.\nWhen the balloon stretches, the width crosswise shrinks to the size of a\nstring. Noah Stocek, a Ph.D. student collaborating with Western physicist\nGiovanni Fanchini, has developed a new nanomaterial that demonstrates the\nopposite of this phenomenon.\n\nWorking at Interface Science Western, home of the Tandetron Accelerator\nFacility, Stocek, and Fanchini formulated two-dimensional nanosheets of\ntungsten semi-carbide (or W_2C, a chemical compound containing equal parts of\ntungsten and carbon atoms), which, when stretched in one direction, expand\nperpendicular to the applied force. This structural design is known as\nauxetics.\n\nThe trick is that the structure of the nanosheet itself isn't flat. The atoms\nin the sheet are made of repeating units consisting of two tungsten atoms for\nevery carbon atom, which are arranged metaphorically like the dimpled surface\nof an egg carton. As tension is applied across the elastic nanosheet in one\ndirection, it expands out in the other dimension as the dimples flatten.\n\nCredit: University of Western Ontario\n\nPrior to this innovation, there was only one reported material that could\nexpand by 10% per unit length in this counter-intuitive way. The Western-\nengineered tungsten semi-carbide nanosheet can expand to 40%, a new world\nrecord.\n\n\"We were specifically looking to create a two-dimensional nanomaterial from\ntungsten semi-carbide,\" said Stocek. \"In 2018, theorists predicted that it\nmight exhibit this behavior to an excellent level, but nobody had been able to\ndevelop it, despite extensive attempts by research groups all over the world.\"\n\nIt wasn't possible to construct the new tungsten semi-carbide nanomaterial\nusing chemical means, so Stocek and Fanchini relied on plasma physics to form\nthe single-atom layers. Made of charged particles of atoms, plasma is the\nfourth state of matter (with solid, liquid, and gas). Plasma can be observed\nin the natural world in the northern lights, or Aurora Borealis, and the sun's\ncorona during the recent solar eclipse. It is also used in neon lighting,\nfluorescent tubes, and flat-screen TVs.\n\nTypically, the instrumentation used to make two-dimensional nanomaterials is\nspecial furnaces where gases are heated at a high enough temperature to react\nand form the desired substance chemically. This approach simply did not work\nbecause any chemical reaction, the most common process, would lead to a\nproduct different from the desired nanomaterial.\n\n\"That's where most researchers who tried to get this material before us got\nstuck, so we had to pivot,\" said Fanchini.\n\nInstead of heating a gas made of tungsten and carbon atoms in furnaces, which\nwould produce neutral particles as you would get for solids, liquids, or\ngases, Stocek and Fanchini designed a new customized instrumentation that\nproduces a plasma, which is made up of electrically charged particles.\n\nCredit: University of Western Ontario\n\nStretch goals\n\nThere are countless possible applications for these W_2C nanosheets, beginning\nwith a new type of strain gauge. These commercially available gauges are a\nstandard way to measure expansion and stretch in everything from airplane\nwings to household plumbing.\n\n\"Imagine if you want to know if a pipe in your house is deforming and risks\nbursting at some point. You can stick a sensor on the pipe made from this two-\ndimensional nanomaterial and then use a computer to monitor the current\npassing through it. If the current rises, it means the pipe is expanding and\nrisks bursting,\" said Stocek.\n\nThe new nanomaterial, in fact, becomes more electrically conductive, and that\nopens the door for endless possibilities to use in things like sensors or any\ndevice that detects events or changes in the environment and sends the\ninformation to other electronics. Another application is embedding the\nmaterial right in stretchable electronics, like wearable technology so that\nthey have more conductivity.\n\n\"Normally, strain gauges would rely on the fact that when you stretch a\nmaterial, it gets thinner, and you change the conductivity of a material to\ncarry a current,\" said Fanchini. \"With this new nanomaterial, this would no\nlonger be the case.\"\n\nThe findings are published in the journal Materials Horizons.\n\nMore information: Noah B.
