On the\nsame day, the Commission opened a market investigation to assess whether\niPadOS constitutes an important gateway for business users to reach end users\nin order to assess whether should be designated as a gatekeeper.\n\nThat investigation has now ended. According to an EC press release shared on\nMonday, the Commission's investigation found that Apple \"presents the features\nof a gatekeeper in relation to iPadOS,\" for the following reasons:\n\n>   * Apple's business user numbers exceeded the quantitative threshold\n> elevenfold, while its end user numbers were close to the threshold and are\n> predicted to rise in the near future.\n>   * End users are locked-in to iPadOS. Apple leverages its large ecosystem\n> to disincentivise end users from switching to other operating systems for\n> tablets.\n>   * Business users are locked-in to iPadOS because of its large and\n> commercially attractive user base, and its importance for certain use cases,\n> such as gaming apps.\n>\n\nThe Commission has now given Apple a six-month deadline to fully comply with\nthe obligations set by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which means we should\nexpect enforced changes in iOS like alternative app marketplaces, web\ndistribution, and alternative browsers to come to iPadOS as well in a\nforthcoming update.\n\n> \"The Digital Markets Act is a dynamic tool which allows us to tackle the\n> realities of digital markets,\" said Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-\n> President in charge of competition policy. \"Today, we have brought Apple's\n> iPadOS within the scope of the DMA obligations. Our market investigation\n> showed that despite not meeting the thresholds, iPadOS constitutes an\n> important gateway on which many companies rely to reach their customers.\n> Today's decision will ensure that fairness and contestability are preserved\n> also on this platform, in addition to the 22 other services we designated\n> last September. Apple has six months to make iPadOS compliant with the DMA.\"\n\nTo be classified as a \"gatekeeper\" under the DMA, a company must fulfill\ncertain criteria, including having sales across the EU of at least \u20ac7.5\nbillion, or a market capitalization of \u20ac75 billion or above. The designation\nalso requires platforms or services to have more than 45 million monthly\nactive users and over 10,000 active business users annually within the EU.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft were all designated\ngatekeepers by the Commission, and had to fully comply with all DMA\nobligations by March 7.\n\nCompanies that do not adhere to the new regulations risk facing EU\ninvestigations, substantial fines, and the imposition of \"behavioral or\nstructural remedies.\" The fines can amount to 10 percent of a company's global\nrevenue, with a 20 percent penalty for repeat violations.\n\nTags: European Commission, European Union\n\n[ 201 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nSophisticatednut\n\n3 hours ago at 03:18 am\n\n> lmao just keep changing the rules. yeah sure lets see how this plays out\n\nThe rules hasn\u2019t changed.
