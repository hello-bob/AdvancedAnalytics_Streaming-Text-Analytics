Data Wrangler is a free extension\nthat offers data viewing and cleaning that is directly integrated into VS Code\nand the Jupyter extension. It provides a rich user interface to view and\nanalyze your data, show insightful column statistics and visualizations, and\nautomatically generate Pandas code as you clean and transform the data. We\nwant to thank all the early adopters who tried out the extension preview over\nthe past year, as your valuable feedback has been crucial to this release.\n\nImage FUll end to end, image\n\nWith this general availability, we are also announcing that the data viewer\nfeature in the Jupyter extension will be going away. In its place, you will be\nable to use the new and improved data viewing experience offered by Data\nWrangler, which is also built by Microsoft. We understand that the data viewer\nwas a beloved feature from our customers, and we see this as the next\nevolution to working with data in VS Code in an extensible manner and hope\nthat you will love the Data Wrangler extension even more than the data viewer\nfeature. Several of the improvements and features of Data Wrangler are\nhighlighted below.\n\n# Previewing data\n\nOnce the Data Wrangler extension is installed, you can get to Data Wrangler in\none of three ways from the Jupyter Notebook.\n\n  1. In the Jupyter > Variables panel, beside any supported data object, you can see a button to open it in Data Wrangler.\n  2. If you have a supported data object in your notebook (such as a Pandas DataFrame), you can now see an Open \u2018df\u2019 in Data Wrangler button (where \u2018df\u2019 is the variable name of your data frame) appear in bottom of the cell after running code that outputs the data frame. This includes df.head(), df.tail(), display(df), print(df), df.\n  3. In the notebook toolbar, selecting View data brings up a list of every supported data object in your notebook. You can then choose which variable in that list you want to open in Data Wrangler.\n\nAlternatively, Data Wrangler can also be directly opened from a local file\n(such as CSV, Excel, or parquet files) by right clicking the file and\nselecting \u201cOpen in Data Wrangler\u201d.\n\n# Filtering and sorting\n\nData Wrangler can be used to quickly filter and sort through your rows of\ndata.\n\nA gif showing the filter feature in Data Wrangler, image\n\n# Transforming data\n\nSwitch from Viewing to Editing mode to unlock additional functionality and\nbuilt-in data cleaning operations in Data Wrangler. For a full list of\nsupported operations, see the documentation here.\n\nA gif showing the switch from viewing to editing modes in Data Wrangler, image\n\n# Code generation\n\nAs you make changes to the data using the built-in operations, Data Wrangler\nautomatically generates code using open-source Python libraries for the data\ntransformation operations you perform.\n\nA gif showing a data transformation operation in Data Wrangler, image\n\nWhen you are done wrangling your data, all the automatically generated code\nfrom your data cleaning session can then be exported either back into your\nNotebook, or into a new Python file.\n\n# Trying Data Wrangler today\n\nTo start using Data Wrangler today in Visual Studio Code, just download the\nData Wrangler extension from the VS Code marketplace to try it out! You can\nthen launch Data Wrangler from any supported data object in a Jupyter Notebook\nor direct from a data file.\n\nThis article only covered some of the high-level features of what Data\nWrangler can do.
