The Open Source Security (OpenSSF) and OpenJS Foundations\nare calling all open source maintainers to be alert for social engineering\ntakeover attempts, to recognize the early threat patterns emerging, and to\ntake steps to protect their open source projects.\n\n## Failed Credible Takeover Attempt\n\nThe OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council received a suspicious series of\nemails with similar messages, bearing different names and overlapping GitHub-\nassociated emails. These emails implored OpenJS to take action to update one\nof its popular JavaScript projects to \u201caddress any critical vulnerabilities,\u201d\nyet cited no specifics. The email author(s) wanted OpenJS to designate them as\na new maintainer of the project despite having little prior involvement. This\napproach bears strong resemblance to the manner in which \u201cJia Tan\u201d positioned\nthemselves in the XZ/liblzma backdoor.\n\nNone of these individuals have been given privileged access to the OpenJS-\nhosted project. The project has security policies in place, including those\noutlined by the Foundation\u2019s security working group.\n\nThe OpenJS team also recognized a similar suspicious pattern in two other\npopular JavaScript projects not hosted by its Foundation, and immediately\nflagged the potential security concerns to respective OpenJS leaders, and the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the United\nStates Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nOpen source projects always welcome contributions from anyone, anywhere, yet\ngranting someone administrative access to the source code as a maintainer\nrequires a higher level of earned trust, and it is not given away as a \u201cquick\nfix\u201d to any problem.\n\nTogether with the Linux Foundation, we want to raise awareness of this ongoing\nthreat to all open source maintainers, and offer practical guidance and\nresources from our broad community of experts in security and open source.\n\n## Suspicious patterns in social engineering takeovers:\n\n  * Friendly yet aggressive and persistent pursuit of maintainer or their hosted entity (foundation or company) by relatively unknown members of the community.\n  * Request to be elevated to maintainer status by new or unknown persons.\n  * Endorsement coming from other unknown members of the community who may also be using false identities, also known as \u201csock puppets.\u201d\n  * PRs containing blobs as artifacts.\n\n    * For example, the XZ backdoor was a cleverly crafted file as part of the test suite that wasn\u2019t human readable, as opposed to source code.\n  * Intentionally obfuscated or difficult to understand source code.\n  * Gradually escalating security issues.\n\n    * For example, the XZ issue started off with a relatively innocuous replacement of safe_fprintf() with fprintf() to see who would notice.\n  * Deviation from typical project compile, build, and deployment practices that could allow the insertion of external malicious payloads into blobs, zips, or other binary artifacts.\n  * A false sense of urgency, especially if the implied urgency forces a maintainer to reduce the thoroughness of a review or bypass a control.\n\nThese social engineering attacks are exploiting the sense of duty that\nmaintainers have with their project and community in order to manipulate them.\nPay attention to how interactions make you feel. Interactions that create\nself-doubt, feelings of inadequacy, of not doing enough for the project, etc.\nmight be part of a social engineering attack.\n\nSocial engineering attacks like the ones we have witnessed with XZ/liblzma\nwere successfully averted by the OpenJS community. These types of attacks are\ndifficult to detect or protect against programmatically as they prey on a\nviolation of trust through social engineering. In the short term, clearly and\ntransparently sharing suspicious activity like those we mentioned above will\nhelp other communities stay vigilant. Ensuring our maintainers are well\nsupported is the primary deterrent we have against these social engineering\nattacks.\n\n## Steps to help secure your open source project:\n\nIn addition to these recommendations, there are a number of security best\npractices that can improve the security properties of our projects. While\nthese recommendations will not thwart a persistent social engineering attack,\nthey may help improve your overall security posture of your project.\n\n  * Consider following industry-standard security best practices such as OpenSSF Guides.\n  * Use strong authentication.\n\n    * Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) or Multifactor Authentication (MFA).\n    * Use a secure password manager.\n    * Preserve your recovery codes in a safe, preferably offline place.\n    * Do not reuse credentials/passwords across different services.\n  * Have a security policy including a \u201ccoordinated disclosure\u201d process for reports.\n  * Use best practices for merging new code.\n\n    * Enable branch protections and signed commits.\n    * If possible, have a second developer conduct code reviews before merging, even when the PR comes from a maintainer.\n    * Enforce readability requirements to ensure new PRs are not obfuscated, and use of opaque binaries is minimized.\n    * Limit who has npm publish rights.\n    * Know your committers and maintainers, and do a periodic review. Have you seen them in your working group meetings or met them at events, for example?\n  * If you run an open source package repository, consider adopting Principles for Package Repository Security.\n  * Review \u201cAvoiding social engineering and phishing attacks\u201d from CISA and/or \u201cWhat is \u2018Social Engineering\u2019\u201d from ENISA.\n\n## Steps for industry and government to help secure critical open source\ninfrastructure:\n\nThe pressure to sustain a stable and secure open source project creates\npressure on maintainers. For example, many projects in the JavaScript\necosystem are maintained by small teams or single developers who are\noverwhelmed by commercial companies who depend on these community-led projects\nyet contribute very little back.\n\nTo solve a problem of this scale, we need vast resources and public/private\ninternational coordination. There is already great work underway by the\nfollowing organizations:\n\n## Open source foundations:\n\nThe Linux Foundation family of foundations and other similar organizations\nlike ours can help provide a safety net for open source projects. Maintainers\noften lack the time, people and expertise in areas such as security. Neutral\nfoundations help support the business, marketing, legal and operations behind\nhundreds of open source projects that so many rely upon. Our goal is to remove\nany friction outside of coding to support our maintainers and help their\nprojects grow. As vendor-neutral nonprofits, we are uniquely positioned to\noffer expertise garnered from multiple stakeholders represented in our\norganizations.\n\nOn security, our open source foundations have found that an effective best\napproach is to provide technical assistance and direct support to open source\nprojects.\n\nAlpha-Omega is an associated project of the OpenSSF, funded by Microsoft,\nGoogle, and Amazon, funds critical projects and ecosystems. The project aims\nto build a world where critical open source projects are secure and where\nsecurity vulnerabilities are found and fixed quickly. The OpenJS Foundation\nhas experienced how funding developers for security has had a proven impact\nthrough Alpha-Omega investments in Node.js and jQuery.\n\n## Sovereign Tech Fund:\n\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund, financed by the German Federal Ministry for Economic\nAffairs and Climate Action, is providing the OpenJS Foundation and more open\nsource organizations significant funding to strengthen infrastructure and\nsecurity.\n\nThey have built a model with detailed reporting and accountability of\nresources, yet at the same time, have technical expertise on staff to\ncustomize security proposals for the variety of open source projects they\nfund.\n\nIt\u2019s encouraging to see the German government taking this initiative to\nimprove the lives of citizens by investing in critical open source\ninfrastructure through the Sovereign Tech Fund.\n\nWe are advocating for more global public investment in initiatives like the\nSovereign Tech Fund to invest in open source global that society depends on,\ncomplimentary to private funding. We recommend that public institutions learn\nfrom, adapt and coordinate with Germany\u2019s Sovereign Tech Fund to support our\ninterconnected open source projects and shared digital economies.\n\n## About OpenJS Foundation\n\nThe OpenJS Foundation is committed to supporting the healthy growth of the\nJavaScript ecosystem and web technologies by providing a neutral organization\nto host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities for\nthe benefit of the community at large. The OpenJS Foundation is made up of 35\nopen source JavaScript projects including Appium, Electron, Jest, jQuery,\nNode.js, and webpack and is supported by corporate and end-user members,\nincluding GoDaddy, Google, HeroDevs, IBM, Joyent, Microsoft, and the Sovereign\nTech Fund. These members recognize the interconnected nature of the JavaScript\necosystem and the importance of providing a central home for projects which\nrepresent significant shared value.\n\n## About the OpenSSF\n\nThe Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) is a cross-industry initiative\nby the Linux Foundation that brings together the industry\u2019s most important\nopen source security initiatives and the individuals and companies that\nsupport them.
