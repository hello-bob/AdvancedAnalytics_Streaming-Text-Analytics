At this point, you can\nselect which of the large files/directories should be included in the backup.\nThis way, you can prevent unnecessarily backing up large files, saving\nbandwidth and cloud storage space.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Warning: ThriftyBackup is currently alpha-quality software. Do not rely\n> on it as your (only) backup solution!\n>\n> Unfortunately, I also lack the time to develop it into a proper application,\n> but anyone interested is welcome to fork the project and give it a better\n> future.\n\nSome of the other features are:\n\n  * (Reverse) incremental backups using rclone's --backup-dir argument\n\n    * this creates copies of files that are updated/removed during an incremental backup\n  * Basic menu bar app, which\n\n    * shows progress for the backup being performed\n    * allows selecting the files to include in a backup exceeding the threshold\n    * lists backup configurations and information on recent backups\n    * can start ncdu so you can easily browse which files are to be backed up (if the threshold is exceeded), or have been backed up (for recent backups)\n    * provides easy access to the configuration and exclude files\n  * Command line tool to list backup snapshots and their sizes\n\n    * planned: pruning of backups (merges reverse snapshots)\n\n## Backup configurations\n\nThiftyBackup supports multiple backup configurations, allowing for setting\nindividual backup intervals and size thresholds for different sets of file.\nFor each configuration, you specify:\n\n  * source: the directory to back up (this can be an external drive)\n  * destination: where on the cloud storage service to store backups for this backup source\n  * (optional) backup interval: if not provided, you need to trigger a backup manually\n  * (optional) size threshold: if not provided, will create a backup regardless of its size\n\nYou can also provide an exclude file for each configuration to limit which\nfiles and directories will be never be backed up.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThriftyBackup builds on rclone and APFS snapshots, so these need to be set up\nbefore you can run it:\n\n  * APFS snapshots require Time Machine to be configured for your backup source\n\n    * add a destination for Time Machine backups ('+' in System Settings > General > Time Machine)\n\n      * this can be a tiny USB thumb drive that you won't actually use for backups\n    * if you want to back up external drives, remove the volume from the TM exclusion list (Options...) (and add all contents to the exclusion list if you do not want to include the drive in regular TM backups)\n  * install rclone and configure it for your cloud storage service\n  * (optional) install ncdu\n\nYou also need to grant ThriftyBackup Full Disk Access in System Settings >\nPrivacy & Security.\n\nAfter all this, you can start ThriftyBackup. On first run, it will create a\nconfiguration file which you can open for editing through the ThriftyBackup\nmenu bar app menu. The configuration file includes some further hints.\n\n## About\n\nCloud backup for the bandwidth-conscious\n\nforum.rclone.org/t/thriftybackup-simple-incremental-cloud-backup-app-for-\nmacos/40820/1\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n6 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\n2 tags\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Python 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
