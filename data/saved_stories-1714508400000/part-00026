They tried to obtain\nclassified information about Australia's trade relationships.\n\n\"They asked a public servant to provide information on security protocols at a\nmajor airport.\"\n\nThe expulsion of spies working for Narendra Modi's government occurred in\n2020, during Scott Morrison's prime ministership.(AAP: Mick Tsikas)\n\nMr Burgess also detailed how the \"nest of spies\" had successfully cultivated\nand recruited an Australian government security clearance holder who had\naccess to \"sensitive details of defence technology\".\n\nNational security and government figures have now confirmed to the ABC that\nIndia's foreign intelligence service was responsible for the \"nest of spies\",\nand \"a number\" of Indian officials were later removed from Australia by the\nMorrison government.\n\nThe Washington Post this week also reported that two members of the Indian\nintelligence agency known as the \"Research and Analysis Wing\" (RAW) were\nexpelled from Australia in 2020 following an ASIO counter-intelligence\noperation.\n\nDetails of New Delhi's clandestine operations in Australia have emerged as\nwestern allies grow increasingly alarmed over the actions of Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi's government across the globe, including an assassination in\nCanada last September.\n\nDo you know more?

Contact us here.\n\nIn an interview with the ABC while visiting the United States in November, Mr\nBurgess declined to say whether the Indian government's foreign operations had\ncaused any concern for ASIO back in Australia.\n\n\"I don't comment on any actions of any government, and you shouldn't read\nanything into that, I can assure you though if we saw acts of foreign\ninterference or plotting for that, we will deal with it,\" Mr Burgess told the\nABC.\n\nFurther pressed on whether he had ever been involved in the expulsion of\nIndian personnel from Australia, the ASIO director-general again declined to\ncomment.\n\n\"We don't comment on specific operational matters but of course, from time-to-\ntime ASIO will discover undeclared intelligence officers who are operating in\nour country and through our own actions or asking government to help, people\ncan and do leave this country as a result of being found out.\"\n\nIndian High Commissioner to Australia Gopal Baglay at an event inside ASIO\nheadquarters in March 2024. (ABC News)\n\nIndia is a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue alongside the United\nStates, Japan and Australia, and is considered a crucial defence partner in\nthe Indo-Pacific where concerns over China's military build-up are growing.\n\nIn 2022, when delivering his next Annual Threat Assessment, Mr Burgess\ndescribed how nations that were considered friendly were still trying to\nconduct espionage against Australia.\n\n\"Multiple countries are seeking to conduct espionage against us \u2014 and not just\nthose countries that might be considered our traditional adversaries,\" he then\nsaid.\n\n\"In some instances, espionage is conducted by countries we consider friends \u2014\nfriends with sharp elbows and voracious intelligence requirements.\"\n\n### Podcast: Looking For Modi\n\nIn this seven-part series, Avani Dias travels around India in search of\nanswers about who Narendra Modi really is and how he has shaped the world's\nmost populous nation.\n\nRead more\n\nGovernment sources have told the ABC that friendly nations believed to be\nparticularly active with espionage operations in Australia include Singapore,\nSouth Korea, Israel and India.\n\nDuring the 2024 Annual Threat Assessment, also delivered inside ASIO\nheadquarters, senior diplomats and ambassadors from Singapore, South Korea,\nIsrael and India were all invited guests to hear Mr Burgess speak.\n\nThe ABC has approached the Indian High Commission and ASIO for comment, but\nboth declined to respond to specific questions about the \"nest of spies\"\noperation.\n\nPosted 8h ago8 hours agoTue 30 Apr 2024 at 6:59am\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### Modi spruiks himself as a single man, but in a humble home in rural India lives his secret wife\n\n  * ### Right-wing protesters tore down an ancient mosque with their bare hands.
