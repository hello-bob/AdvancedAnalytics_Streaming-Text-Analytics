Phillips\n\nEdel Rodriguez\n\nThe first thing to acknowledge about diversity is that it can be difficult. In\nthe U.S., where the dialogue of inclusion is relatively advanced, even the\nmention of the word \u201cdiversity\u201d can lead to anxiety and conflict. Supreme\nCourt justices disagree on the virtues of diversity and the means for\nachieving it. Corporations spend billions of dollars to attract and manage\ndiversity both internally and externally, yet they still face discrimination\nlawsuits, and the leadership ranks of the business world remain predominantly\nwhite and male.\n\nIt is reasonable to ask what good diversity does us. Diversity of expertise\nconfers benefits that are obvious\u2014you would not think of building a new car\nwithout engineers, designers and quality-control experts\u2014but what about social\ndiversity? What good comes from diversity of race, ethnicity, gender and\nsexual orientation? Research has shown that social diversity in a group can\ncause discomfort, rougher interactions, a lack of trust, greater perceived\ninterpersonal conflict, lower communication, less cohesion, more concern about\ndisrespect, and other problems. So what is the upside?\n\nThe fact is that if you want to build teams or organizations capable of\ninnovating, you need diversity. Diversity enhances creativity. It encourages\nthe search for novel information and perspectives, leading to better decision-\nmaking and problem-solving. Diversity can improve the bottom line of companies\nand lead to unfettered discoveries and breakthrough innovations. Even simply\nbeing exposed to diversity can change the way you think. This is not just\nwishful thinking: it is the conclusion I draw from decades of research from\norganizational scientists, psychologists, sociologists, economists and\ndemographers.\n\n## Information and Innovation\n\nThe key to understanding the positive influence of diversity is the concept of\ninformational diversity. When people are brought together to solve problems in\ngroups, they bring different information, opinions and perspectives. This\nmakes obvious sense when we talk about diversity of disciplinary\nbackgrounds\u2014think again of the interdisciplinary team building a car. The same\nlogic applies to social diversity. People who are different from one another\nin race, gender and other dimensions bring unique information and experiences\nto bear on the task at hand. A male and a female engineer might have\nperspectives as different from each other as an engineer and a physicist\u2014and\nthat is a good thing.\n\nResearch on large, innovative organizations has shown repeatedly that this is\nthe case. For example, business professors Cristian Dezs\u00f6 of the University of\nMaryland and David Gaddis Ross of the University of Florida studied the effect\nof gender diversity on the top firms in Standard & Poor\u2019s Composite 1500 list,\na group designed to reflect the overall U.S. equity market. First, they\nexamined the size and gender composition of firms\u2019 top management teams from\n1992 through 2006. Then they looked at the financial performance of the firms.\nIn their words, they found that, on average, \u201cfemale representation in top\nmanagement leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.\u201d They also\nmeasured the firms\u2019 \u201cinnovation intensity\u201d through the ratio of research and\ndevelopment expenses to assets. They found that companies that prioritized\ninnovation saw greater financial gains when women were part of the top\nleadership ranks.\n\nRacial diversity can deliver the same kinds of benefits. In a study conducted\nin 2003, Orlando Richard, now at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and\nhis colleagues surveyed executives at 177 national banks in the U.S., then put\ntogether a database comparing financial performance, racial diversity and the\nemphasis the bank presidents put on innovation. For innovation-focused banks,\nincreases in racial diversity were clearly related to enhanced financial\nperformance.\n\nEvidence for the benefits of diversity can be found well beyond the U.S. In\nAugust 2012 a team of researchers at the Credit Suisse Research Institute\nissued a report in which they examined 2,360 companies globally from 2005 to\n2011, looking for a relation between gender diversity on corporate management\nboards and financial performance. Sure enough, the researchers found that\ncompanies with one or more women on the board delivered higher average returns\non equity, lower gearing (that is, net debt to equity) and better average\ngrowth.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### How Temperate Forests Could Help Limit Climate Change\n\nAmanda Leland & Steven Hamburg\n\n  * ### Biden Kicks Off Earth Week with Solar Funding, Expanding Climate Corps\n\nJean Chemnick & E&E News\n\n  * ### It\u2019s Time to Act on Pilots\u2019 Mental Health\n\nWilliam R.

Research on racial diversity in small groups, however, makes it\npossible to draw some causal conclusions. Again, the findings are clear: for\ngroups that value innovation and new ideas, diversity helps.\n\nIn 2006 Margaret Neale of Stanford University, Gregory Northcraft of the\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and I set out to examine the impact\nof racial diversity on small decision-making groups in an experiment where\nsharing information was a requirement for success. Our subjects were\nundergraduate students taking business courses at the University of Illinois.\nWe put together three-person groups\u2014some consisting of all white members,\nothers with two white members and one nonwhite member\u2014and had them perform a\nmurder mystery exercise. We made sure that all group members shared a common\nset of information, but we also gave each member important clues that only he\nor she knew. To find out who committed the murder, the group members would\nhave to share all the information they collectively possessed during\ndiscussion. The groups with racial diversity significantly outperformed the\ngroups with no racial diversity. Being with similar others leads us to think\nwe all hold the same information and share the same perspective. This\nperspective, which stopped the all-white groups from effectively processing\nthe information, is what hinders creativity and innovation.\n\nCredit: Edel Rodriguez\n\nOther researchers have found similar results. In 2004 Anthony Lising Antonio,\na professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Education, collaborated with\nfive colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, and other\ninstitutions to examine the influence of racial and opinion composition in\nsmall group discussions. More than 350 students from three universities\nparticipated in the study. Group members were asked to discuss a prevailing\nsocial issue (either child labor practices or the death penalty) for 15\nminutes. The researchers wrote dissenting opinions and had both Black and\nwhite members deliver them to their groups. When a Black person presented a\ndissenting perspective to a group of white people, the perspective was\nperceived as more novel and led to broader thinking and consideration of\nalternatives than when a white person introduced that same dissenting\nperspective. The lesson: when we hear dissent from someone who is different\nfrom us, it provokes more thought than when it comes from someone who looks\nlike us.\n\nThis effect is not limited to race. For example, in 2013 professors of\nmanagement Denise Lewin Loyd of the University of Illinois, Cynthia Wang of\nNorthwestern University, Robert B. Lount, Jr., of the Ohio State University\nand I asked 186 people whether they identified as a Democrat or a Republican,\nthen had them read a murder mystery and decide who they thought committed the\ncrime. Next, we asked the subjects to prepare for a meeting with another group\nmember by writing an essay communicating their perspective. More important, in\nall cases, we told the participants that their partner disagreed with their\nopinion but that they would need to come to an agreement with the other\nperson. Everyone was told to prepare to convince their meeting partner to come\naround to their side; half of the subjects, however, were told to prepare to\nmake their case to a member of the opposing political party, and half were\ntold to make their case to a member of their own party.\n\nThe result: Democrats who were told that a fellow Democrat disagreed with them\nprepared less well for the discussion than Democrats who were told that a\nRepublican disagreed with them. Republicans showed the same pattern. When\ndisagreement comes from a socially different person, we are prompted to work\nharder. Diversity jolts us into cognitive action in ways that homogeneity\nsimply does not.\n\nFor this reason, diversity appears to lead to higher-quality scientific\nresearch. In 2014 Richard Freeman, an economics professor at Harvard\nUniversity and director of the Science and Engineering Workforce Project at\nthe National Bureau of Economic Research, along with Wei Huang, then a Harvard\neconomics Ph.D. candidate, examined the ethnic identity of the authors of 1.5\nmillion scientific papers written between 1985 and 2008 using Thomson\nReuters\u2019s Web of Science, a comprehensive database of published research. They\nfound that papers written by diverse groups receive more citations and have\nhigher impact factors than papers written by people from the same ethnic\ngroup. Moreover, they found that stronger papers are associated with greater\nnumbers of not only references but also author addresses\u2014geographical\ndiversity is a reflection of more intellectual diversity.\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nCheck out our other newsletters\n\n## The Power of Anticipation\n\nDiversity is not only about bringing different perspectives to the table.\nSimply adding social diversity to a group makes people believe that\ndifferences of perspective might exist among them, and that belief makes\npeople change their behavior.\n\nMembers of a homogeneous group rest somewhat assured that they will agree with\none another, understand one another\u2019s perspectives and beliefs, and be able to\neasily come to a consensus. But when members of a group notice that they are\nsocially different from one another, they change their expectations. They\nanticipate differences of opinion and perspective. They assume they will need\nto work harder to come to a consensus. This logic helps to explain both the\nupside and the downside of social diversity: people work harder in diverse\nenvironments both cognitively and socially. They might not like it, but the\nhard work can lead to better outcomes.\n\nIn a 2006 study of jury decision-making, social psychologist Samuel Sommers of\nTufts University found that racially diverse groups exchanged a wider range of\ninformation during deliberation about a sexual assault case than all-white\ngroups did. In collaboration with judges and jury administrators in a Michigan\ncourtroom, Sommers conducted mock jury trials with a group of real selected\njurors. Although the participants knew the mock jury was a court-sponsored\nexperiment, they did not know that the true purpose of the research was to\nstudy the impact of racial diversity on jury decision-making.\n\nSommers composed the six-person juries with either all white jurors or four\nwhite and two Black jurors. As you might expect, the diverse juries were\nbetter at considering case facts, made fewer errors recalling relevant\ninformation and displayed a greater openness to discussing the role of race in\nthe case. These improvements did not necessarily happen because the Black\njurors brought new information to the group\u2014they happened because white jurors\nchanged their behavior in the presence of the Black jurors. In the presence of\ndiversity, they were more diligent and open-minded.\n\n## Group Exercise\n\nConsider the following scenario: You are writing up a section of a paper for\npresentation at an upcoming conference. You are anticipating some disagreement\nand potential difficulty communicating because your collaborator is American\nand you are Chinese. Because of one social distinction, you may focus on other\ndifferences between yourself and that person, such as their culture,\nupbringing and experiences\u2014differences that you would not expect from another\nChinese collaborator. How do you prepare for the meeting? In all likelihood,\nyou will work harder on explaining your rationale and anticipating\nalternatives than you would have otherwise.\n\nThis is how diversity works: by promoting hard work and creativity; by\nencouraging the consideration of alternatives even before any interpersonal\ninteraction takes place. The pain associated with diversity can be thought of\nas the pain of exercise. You have to push yourself to grow your muscles. The\npain, as the old saw goes, produces the gain. In just the same way, we need\ndiversity\u2014in teams, organizations and society as a whole\u2014if we are to change,\ngrow and innovate.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nKatherine W.
