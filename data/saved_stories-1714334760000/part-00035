Addressing rising unemployment requires skill\nevolution and innovative educational approaches to prepare for the future\nworkforce demands.\n\nGetty Images\n\nOur youth need to stop blindly following the latest tech trends and invest in\nbuilding skills that will withstand the test of time.\n\nFor years, science fiction has warned us of a future where we devise our own\nobsolescence. Are we living that reality?\n\nA one-minute search on Google will show headlines in debate among themselves.\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSponsored Links Sponsored Links\n\nPromoted Links Promoted Links\n\nYou May Like\n\nCrossout\n\nShooter Action MMOCrossout\n\nUndo\n\n\u201cAI is taking over the job market\u201d\n\n\u201cAI won\u2019t replace humans\u201d\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 50:00\n\nLoaded: 0.00%\n\n00:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nRemaining Time -50:00\n\n1x\n\n  * Chapters\n\n  * descriptions off, selected\n\n  * captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n  * captions off, selected\n\n  * default, selected\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

The rise of the Content\nManagement System (CMS) saw these high-paying roles vanish in favour of junior\nroles that barely survived the exodus to marketing roles. Companies simply\ndon\u2019t hire a senior-level person to do that work anymore.\n\nAI and automation will wipe out a far more significant number of jobs.\nMillions of people worldwide will have to switch jobs, upgrade, or learn new\nskills.\n\nA McKinsey Report estimated that AI could replace 400 million \u2013 15 percent of\nthe entire global workforce! In India, unemployment statistics are coming out\nfrom all corners of the nation; students from premier engineering institutions\nare unable to secure placements.\n\nDemand for IT jobs related to data collection and data processing will\ncontinue to fall as will all work in structured, predictable environments.\n\nThis is a major chunk of all work that people do across most sectors and\neconomies. In short, technology will continue to make jobs vanish, and they\nmay never come back.\n\nThe problem is even more complex in emerging economies such as India, with a\nyoung population and a challenging need to provide to millions at the cusp of\nentering the workforce.\n\nThe jobs lost would be mitigated by the jobs gained Technology development and\ndeployment will continue unabated. Other demands and drivers of work \u2013\ninfrastructure creation and maintenance, healthcare, green energy and energy\ntransition, and other deep tech domains \u2013 will continue with more than 800\nmillion new jobs adding 21 to 33 percent of the global workforce.\n\nWhile AI can crunch data and identify patterns, it lacks the spark we call\nimagination. Think of India\u2019s vibrant startup ecosystem \u2013 there are over 3,000\ndeep tech startups in India today, and Nasscom predicts we will surpass 10,000\nby 2030. While AI is an integral part of deep tech, the roles need complex\nproblems to be solved and non-routine problems that simply cannot be\nautomated. What these problems need is creativity and ingenuity.\n\nThe Future of Work and What skills are needed? Our youth will need different\nskills to thrive in the workforce of the future. Along with advanced technical\nskills, there will be an increased demand for social and emotional skills such\nas communication and empathy and higher-order cognitive skills such as\ncritical thinking, creativity, problem-solving with complex information\nprocessing, and decision-making.\n\nOur education system, however, is not geared towards developing these skill\nsets. The foundation of deep tech roles lies in tangible engineering. What we\nneed is a shift away from an overly theoretical curriculum to an educational\nmodel that promotes curiosity, experimentation, and hands-on learning.\n\nIt's about transforming classrooms into collaborative spaces where students\nform interdisciplinary connections and test concepts, build prototypes, and\nsolve real-life problems.\n\nThis approach not only equips students with technical skills but also enhances\ntheir cognitive skills, preparing them for a seamless transition from\nclassrooms to careers.\n\nKey Takeaway Our government needs to prioritise greater (not lesser) spending\non education. It needs to proactively identify areas of future skill shortages\nand then take steps to mitigate them.\n\nOur educational institutions need to emerge out of hibernation and switch to\nmore experiential learning modes.\n\nOur youth need to stop blindly following the latest tech trends and invest in\nbuilding skills that will withstand the test of time.\n\nKnowledge of software is no longer enough. Students need to combine that with\nhardware knowledge and domain expertise in up-and-coming industry interest\nareas. Additionally, investing in developing cognitive as well as\ncommunication skills is what will help them adapt and thrive in workplaces of\nthe future.\n\nAI can optimise and automate, but the spark of creativity, the leap of\nintuition, and the courage to explore the unknown come from the human spirit.\nIt's about nurturing a generation of makers \u2013 master innovators, real problem\nsolvers, confident builders, and ethical leaders \u2013 who can harness the power\nof technology to convert the pressing challenges of our times into\nopportunities and emerge as winners.\n\nDamyanti Bhattacharya is CEO of Maker Bhavan Foundation\n\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.
