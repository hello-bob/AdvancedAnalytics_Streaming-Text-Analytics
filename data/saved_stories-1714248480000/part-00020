But now the study\nof Boyajian\u2019s star is being promoted as a research model that could help in\none of the most intriguing of all scientific quests: finding intelligent life\non other worlds.\n\nThis is the argument that Oxford University astrophysicist Prof Chris Lintott\nwill make at a public lecture \u2013 Is it Aliens? The Most Unusual Star in the\nGalaxy \u2013 at a Gresham College lecture in Conway Hall, central London on\nMonday. His prime target will be Boyajian\u2019s star, sometimes nicknamed Tabby\u2019s\nstar after scientist Tabetha Boyajian, in the constellation Cygnus whose odd\ndimming and brightening has been the subject of intense study by space probes\nand observatories in recent years.\n\n\u201cIts behaviour is extraordinary,\u201d Lintott told the Observer. \u201cIt has rapid,\nrandom bursts where its brightness drops dramatically and then returns. There\nis no pattern to it. It flickers as if somebody was playing with its dimmer\nswitch. There is no other star like this in our galaxy.\u201d\n\nBoyajian\u2019s star was studied in detail by the Kepler space observatory in 2012\nwhen its erratic behaviour was first uncovered. These observations indicated\nthat a huge mass of matter circles the star in tight formation and\nsporadically blocks its light.\n\nBut what was the nature of this vast mass of material? Dust rings,\ndisintegrating comets and swarms of asteroids were all put forward as\nexplanations. However, most attention went to the theory, proposed by\nscientists at Penn State University, that the eclipsing mass could be a huge\nalien megastructure.\n\n> Humanity could become radio-quiet in about 50 years \u2013 and that will probably\n> be true for civilisations on other worlds\n\nChris Lintott, astrophysicist\n\nSuch constructions were proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson, who argued that\nsome alien civilisations might be advanced enough to build vast arrays of\nsolar panels around their home stars to capture its heat and light. Dubbed\nDyson spheres or swarms by astronomers, the great orbiting edifices would be\nused to power these distant civilisations.\n\nThe idea that astronomers had stumbled on such a structure triggered headlines\nround the globe \u2013 though not for long. Subsequent research has now undermined\nthe idea. \u201cWe have found that light of different wavelengths is blocked in\ndifferent amounts: exactly what you would expect from starlight passing\nthrough a dust cloud,\u201d said Lintott.\n\nBoyajian\u2019s eclipsing mass is probably a dust cloud produced when a planet\ngrazed too close to its surface and was torn apart. Nevertheless, the study of\nthe strange object is important because it highlights techniques that are\ndestined to become increasingly important as attempts to pinpoint alien\ncivilisations intensify in coming years, Lintott argues.\n\nHumanity could become radio-quiet in about 50 years as a result \u2013 and that\nwill probably be true for civilisations on other worlds\u201cThe search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence [Seti] is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have relied in\nthe past almost exclusively on radio telescopes to detect broadcasts from\nalien civilisations just as our radio and TV transmissions could reveal our\npresence to them. However, to date, we have heard absolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nNor should we be surprised, Lintott argues. \u201cHumanity has already passed its\npeak radio wave output because we are increasingly using narrow beam\ncommunications and fibre-optic cables, rather than beaming out TV and radio\nsignals into the general environment.\u201d\n\nHumanity could become radio-quiet in about 50 years as a result \u2013 and that\nwill probably be true for civilisations on other worlds, he added. \u201cThey will\nhave gone radio silent after a while, like us. So Seti radio telescopes will\nneed to be augmented with other ways of seeking aliens. We are going to have\nto be more creative about what we\u2019re searching for in the data and find\nunusual things that reveal they are the handiwork of aliens.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best\nObserver writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

An example would be provided by an alien civilization\nthat mined asteroids near their home planet, an endeavour that would create\nclouds of interplanetary dust that would reveal themselves from their infrared\nradiation.\n\n\u201cAnd while aliens may not reveal themselves through radio transmissions, they\ncould easily betray their presence from their radar emissions that they use to\nguide their aircraft and spaceships,\u201d added Lintott. \u201cAgain, we need to look\nat these wavelengths for signs of their existence.\u201d\n\nSuch work will require analyses of colossal stores of data and the story of\nBoyajian\u2019s star also provides a key demonstration of how they would be done.\nIts secrets were revealed by an army of citizen scientists, members of the\npublic who collected and analysed the vast reams of data from the instruments\nthat probed the star, said Lintott.\n\n\u201cIt was their combined analyses of data about Boyajian\u2019s that showed it was\nbehaving in a very odd manner \u2013 and it is very likely they will be involved in\nfingering other weird stars in our galaxy in future projects. And you never\nknow, the next time they might hit pay dirt.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Alien life\n  * The Observer\n  * Space\n  * Nasa\n  * Seti (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)\n  * Astronomy\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
