It ran on a\nVAX-11/750 running 4.1BSD. An updated version, credited to Phil Betchel, Cliff\nSpencer, Gretchen Phillips, John LoVerso, and Don Gworek, was posted to the\nnet.sources Usenet newsgroup in December of 1985.\n\n## Sudo at CU-Boulder\n\nIn the Summer of 1986, Garth Snyder released an enhanced version of sudo. For\nthe next 5 years, sudo was fed and watered by a handful of folks at CU-\nBoulder, including Bob Coggeshall, Bob Manchek, and Trent Hein.\n\n## Root Group Sudo\n\nIn 1991, Dave Hieb and Jeff Nieusma wrote a new version of sudo with an\nenhanced sudoers format under contract to a consulting firm called \u201cThe Root\nGroup\u201d. This version was later released under the GNU public license.\n\n## CU Sudo\n\nIn 1994, after maintaining sudo informally within CU-Boulder for some time,\nTodd C. Miller made a public release of \u201cCU sudo\u201d (version 1.3) with bug fixes\nand support for more operating systems. The \u201cCU\u201d was added to differentiate it\nfrom the \u201cofficial\u201d version from \u201cThe Root Group\u201d.\n\nIn 1995, a new parser for the sudoers file was contributed by Chris Jepeway.\nThe new parser was a proper grammar (unlike the old one) and could work with\nboth sudo and visudo (previously they had slightly different parsers).\n\nIn 1996, Todd, who had been maintaining sudo for several years in his spare\ntime, moved distribution of sudo from a CU-Boulder ftp site to his domain,\ncourtesan.com.\n\n## Just Plain Sudo\n\nIn 1999, the \u201cCU\u201d prefix was dropped from the name since there had been no\nformal release of sudo from \u201cThe Root Group\u201d since 1991 (the original authors\nnow work elsewhere). As of version 1.6, Sudo no longer contains any of the\noriginal \u201cRoot Group\u201d code and is available under an ISC-style license.\n\nIn 2001, the sudo web site, ftp site, and mailing lists were moved from\ncourtesan.com to the sudo.ws domain (sudo.org was already taken).\n\n## LDAP Integration\n\nIn 2003, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company contributed code written by Aaron\nSpangler to store the sudoers data in LDAP. These changes were incorporated\ninto Sudo 1.6.8.\n\n## New Parser\n\nIn 2005, Todd rewrote the sudoers parser to better support the features that\nhad been added in the past ten years. This new parser removes some limitations\nof the previous one, removes ordering constraints and adds support for\nincluding multiple sudoers files.\n\n## Quest Sponsorship\n\nIn 2010, Quest Software began sponsoring Sudo development by hiring Todd to\nwork on Sudo as part of his full-time job. This enabled the addition of I/O\nlogging, the plugin API, the log server, additional regression and fuzz tests,\nsupport for binary packages and more regular releases. Quest\u2019s sponsorship of\nSudo ended in February of 2024.\n\n## Present Day\n\nSudo, in its current form, is maintained by:\n\n    \n    \n    Todd C. Miller <Todd.Miller@sudo.ws>\n\nTodd continues to enhance sudo and fix bugs.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
