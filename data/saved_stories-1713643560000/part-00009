Subject to addressing any remaining competition concerns\nof the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, Chrome will ramp up third-party\ncookie restrictions to 100% of users from H2 2024.\n\nlooks_one\n\n### Understand third-party cookie phaseout\n\nLearn more about the timeline of third-party cookie deprecation and understand\nwhat actions you need to take to preserve your site's functionalities.\n\nPrepare for phaseout\n\nlooks_two\n\n### Audit your use of cookies\n\nReview your cookies and make a list of those cookies for which you will need\nto take action to ensure they keep functioning properly.\n\nStart auditing\n\nlooks_3\n\n### Test for breakage\n\nSet up Chrome to block third-party cookies and enable new functionality and\nmitigations to simulate the state after the phase out.\n\nStart testing\n\n## Migrate to privacy preserving solutions\n\nOnce you have identified the cookies with issues and you understand the use\ncases for them, you can work through the following options to pick the\nnecessary solution.\n\nlooks_one\n\n### CHIPS\n\nThe new cookie attribute, Partitioned, allows developers to opt a cookie into\npartitioned storage, with separate cookie jars per top-level site.\n\nExplore CHIPS\n\nlooks_two\n\n### Storage Access API\n\nStorage Access API allows iframes to request storage access permissions when\naccess would otherwise be denied by browser settings.\n\nExplore Storage Access API\n\nlooks_3\n\n### Related Website Sets\n\nRelated Website Sets (RWS) is a way for a company to declare relationships\namong sites, so that browsers allow limited third-party cookie access for\nspecific purposes.\n\nExplore Related Website Sets\n\nlooks_4\n\n### Federated Credential Management API\n\nA web API for privacy-preserving identity federation.\n\nExplore FedCM\n\n## Guides for common workflows\n\nUnderstand how to test common workflows that may rely on third-party cookies\nand decide on which privacy-preserving alternatives to migrate to.\n\nperson\n\n### Identity guide\n\nFind recommended solutions for sign-in scenarios likely to be affected by\nthird-party cookie restrictions.\n\nLearn more\n\npicture_in_picture_alt\n\n### Embed guide\n\nTest for embed-related journeys that rely on third-party cookies, and learn\nhow to choose between the privacy-preserving alternatives.\n\nLearn more\n\n## Temporary exceptions\n\nCross-site cookies have been a critical part of the web for over a quarter of\na century.
