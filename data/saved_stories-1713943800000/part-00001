We spoke\nexclusively to FTC Chair Lina Khan about the landmark rule.\n\nApr 23, 2024\n\n47\n\nShare this post\n\n#### BREAKING: The FTC Just Banned Noncompete Agreements\n\nsubstack.perfectunion.us\n\n1\n\nShare\n\nBy Paul Blest, More Perfect Union\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission voted Tuesday to ban new noncompete agreements\nfor all workers and make existing noncompetes null and void for everyone\nexcept senior executives. These agreements are used to restrict 30 million\nAmerican workers from changing jobs or starting their own businesses due to\nclaims that they could use \u201ctrade secrets\u201d in their new roles.\n\nNoncompete agreements can restrict job mobility based on geographic area\n(i.e., a doctor joining a new practice within 50 miles of their old one) or a\ntime period after leaving the position (anywhere between several months to\nmore than a year). They have been banned in multiple states in the past few\nyears.\n\nBut the FTC has issued a uniform ban that will cover hundreds of millions of\nworkers following a 180-day period for for-profit companies to enter into\ncompliance. More than 26,000 comments were submitted on the rule, more than\n25,000 of which supported a noncompete ban, FTC staff said Tuesday.\n\nThe FTC estimated that the new rule will increase workers\u2019 wages by up to $488\nbillion over 10 years, which FTC staff said would mean a $524 increase in\nannual wages for the average worker. The FTC also estimated that the rule\nwould lead to more than 8,500 new businesses per year.\n\n\u201cRight now workers are stuck in place because of these noncompetes,\u201d FTC chair\nLina Khan told More Perfect Union in an interview about the rule. \u201cSo even if\nthey get a better job opportunity with higher wages, with better benefits,\nthey can't actually switch jobs, which is bad for those workers. It's also bad\nfor other workers who won't have the opportunities that are not being created\nbecause of these noncompetes.\u201d\n\nWatch our new interview with FTC Chair Khan:\n\nFive states have passed bans on noncompetes, not including New York, where\nlawmakers passed a ban last year that was then vetoed by Gov. Kathy Hochul.\nAfter Oregon banned noncompete agreements in 2008, researchers found, average\nhourly wages for all workers were boosted by up to 3 percent; the same\nanalysis found that low-wage workers subjected to noncompetes saw a\nsubstantial negative impact on their wages.\n\nThe final rule differs from the proposal in that \u201csenior executives,\u201d those in\na \u201cpolicy-making position\u201d making more than $151,000 per year, will still be\nsubjected to noncompete agreements signed before the effective date of the new\nrule.\n\nSince announcing the proposal in early 2023, the FTC\u2019s rule has come under\nfire from the business lobby. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said before\nTuesday\u2019s meeting that it will file a lawsuit to block the proposal as soon as\nWednesday. A top Chamber official said earlier this week that the rule \u201copens\nup a Pandora\u2019s box where this commission or future commissions could be\nliterally micromanaging every aspect of the economy,\u201d Bloomberg reported.\n\nBut the FTC argues that noncompete agreements are \u201can unfair method of\ncompetition\u201d that affect both high- and l0w-wage earners. In the medical\nprofession, nearly half of all physicians are subject to noncompete\nagreements, according to the American Medical Association, which backs the\neffort to end the practice. (The FTC estimated that the new rule will result\nin \u201c$74-$194 billion in reduced spending on physician services over the next\ndecade.\u201d)\n\n\u201cAs a physician who has to live within thirty minutes of my workplace\nnoncompete clauses will require me to uproot my family if I ever wanted to\nconsider a new job,\u201d one doctor said in a comment posted in February. \u201cIt\nlimits my freedom to choose where I work when considering all aspects of life.\nIt gives my current employer power in negotiating when negotiating my\ncontract.\u201d\n\nAnd in a comment earlier this month, a one-time Home Depot worker who earned\n$11/hour encouraged the FTC to ban what they described as \u201charmful\nstipulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spoke with the management of several Tool [sic] producers seeking\nemployment as a Sales Rep and was told I would get the job if not for a\nnoncompete agreement with Home Depot,\u201d the commenter said. \u201cSo instead of\ndoing the exact same thing for 70K plus bonuses, I was stuck in abject poverty\ntrying to provide for my wife and disabled toddler.\u201d\n\nThese experiences mirror much of the feedback the FTC received, Khan said.\n\n\u201cWe got comments from across the income level people making near minimum wage,\nbut also people making tens of thousands of dollars or even hundreds of\nthousands of dollars, sharing stories about how noncompetes had been\ndevastating for their lives,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe heard from doctors in rural\nAmerica who shared how noncompetes really limit their ability to continue\nproviding care for their patients if they ever look to change employers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this is having real-world effects harming Americans and harming their\ncommunities,\u201d she added.\n\n### Subscribe to More Perfect Union\n\nLaunched a year ago\n\nMedia that builds power for working people.\n\n47 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n9 Restacks\n\n47\n\nShare this post\n\n#### BREAKING: The FTC Just Banned Noncompete Agreements\n\nsubstack.perfectunion.us\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n1 Comment\n\nRosemary Kirlin8 hrs agoI know in Des Moines, Iowa the lowest paid hospital\nemployees & caregivers are subject to non-compete agreements just the same as\nphysicians are. These noncompete agreements keep low paid employees in poverty\nand effectively hold wages down for the low paid workers in cities & towns\nwhere there are often only one or two large employers in healthcare across an\nentire rural state.
