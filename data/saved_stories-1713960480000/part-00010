However, we believe that it has risk of violating copyright in\nfour important ways. Here, I explain those risks and present an alternative:\nTess.\n\nBy Julia Enthoven\n\nApr 24, 2024 \u2014 4 min read\n\nImage by Touch of Whimsey on Tess\n\nToday, Adobe launched Firefly Image 3. With a big upgrade in quality, Adobe\ndeclares that \u201cwe remain committed to developing generative AI responsibly\nwith creators at the center.\u201d\n\nAlthough I admire Adobe's efforts to support C2PA, Firefly has four major\ncopyright concerns that muddy their ethical argument. In this article, I share\nthose concerns and propose a pro-artist alternative model for AI image\ngenerators that supports a healthier ecosystem.\n\n### Adobe Stock Contributors did not specifically agree to license their\nimages for the purposes of training AI models\n\nAdobe claims the use of Adobe Stock images to train their Firefly AI model is\ncovered under the existing contributor agreement, which grants Adobe rights to\n\"develop new features and services\" from the contributed content (source).\n\nHowever, some contributors argue they were not explicitly notified or did not\nrealize this broad language would allow Adobe to train an AI model that could\npotentially generate derivative works mimicking their art style.\n\n\u201cThe Adobe Stock Contributor Agreement isn't at all clear about the use of\ncontributor photos for this kind of thing. I expect backlash from stock\nphotographers about the use of their images to train Adobe's AI model\u201d wrote\none artist in an ArsTechnical forum.\n\nSince launching last year, Adobe Stock has not updated its Contributor\nAgreement - which predates the technology - to clarify the use of stock images\nto train Firefly. There is no mention of the Firefly Contributor Bonus in the\nPayment section of the agreement.\n\n### Adobe Stock Contributors cannot opt out of training Firefly\n\nAccording to Adobe\u2019s Firefly FAQ, it is impossible for an artist to Opt Out or\nstop Adobe from using their work to train AI models.\n\n\u201cWe currently do not allow for an opt-out mechanism for Adobe Stock content,\nas this content is used for building AI models for a variety of existing and\nfuture Stock features.\u201d\n\n### The training set includes synthetic images\n\nOn the webpage comparing Firefly vs Midjourney, Adobe says that Firefly users\ncan \u201cfeel at ease knowing you\u2019re creating AI images from data based on Adobe\nStock....\u201d\n\nHowever, Adobe Stock accepts images uploaded from AI image generators. The\ncompany said that up to 5% of its training data is these synthetic images,\nundermining the claim that it only uses commercially-licensed content.\n\n### Users do not have to prove ownership of the rights for a stylistic\nreference\n\nWhen using Adobe Firefly, you can upload a reference image to transform your\ngenerated image into that style. However, without any content moderation step,\nusers can easily generate with a photo they don\u2019t have the right to use. The\nresult is that it becomes easy to \u201cborrow\u201d the visual style of well-known\nartists without crediting them, paying them, or getting their permission, and\nthere is a high risk of copyright infringement.\n\nBelow is an example of an image cast into the style of an artist who vocally\nasked not to have their images used with generative AI:\n\nThe underlying issue here is that Firefly and other AI image generators cannot\nattribute what styles have influenced the outputs, making it difficult to\nprotect artists and enable them to see, own, content to, and profit when their\nwork is used in the wild.\n\n# A better approach\n\nI\u2019m the cofounder of a startup called Tess. We are the first properly-licensed\nAI image generator. Tess ensures that artists are paid when the AI image\ngenerator produces work substantially similar to their own. To introduce a\nmiddle layer between the inputs (enormous training data) and a stylized image,\nTess leverages Stable Diffusion as the underlying model and transforms each\ngenerator with strong influence from 10-20 images.\n\nImage by Touch of Whimsey on Tess\n\nIn contrast to Adobe Firefly, Tess does empower artists to own their visual\nstyle:\n\n  * Tess Contributors submit images knowing they will be used to train an AI model through a transparent contributor agreement. Our novel agreement specifies that the work will be use \u201cto develop and improve machine-learning and artificial-intelligence technologies and generations\u201d and this is evident in our payment model. As a result, we protect the livelihood of artists who set up a Tess model specifically for this purpose and the copyright of artists who choose not to participate.\n  * Contributors choose to participate on Tess or not, and we respect the rights of artists who do not participate by preventing users from generating in their style\n  * Tess's Content Moderation team verifies contributors own the rights to images they submit for training data.\n  * Tess users cannot reference works or styles that were not specifically licensed for use with Tess\n\nTess gives transparency to both the buyer and artist. The buyer knows whose\nwork influenced the model and can contact the author of the visual style for\ncustom commissions.\n\nWe believe that the Tess business model most clearly maps to the way clients\ncommission human illustrators: you can\u2019t control all the art that the person\nhas seen in their life, but you can give them a reference or instructions of\nwhat you want drawn and refer to their past work for a visual style.\n\nWe launched into Beta last week \u2013 get on the waitlist by signing in at\nTess.design or send us your thoughts at hello@tess.design.\n\nAbout the author\n\nHey, I'm Julia Enthoven! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nStartups, art, and local journalism\n\nTESS\n\nHomeFor PublishersFor ArtistsModelsBlogSign In\n\nResources\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPrivacy PolicyGuidelinesLicenseAbout Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Tess.
