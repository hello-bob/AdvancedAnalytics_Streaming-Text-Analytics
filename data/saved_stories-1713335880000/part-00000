But for more than 20 years after the\nend of World War Two, this formerly neutral northern European country pursued\na plan to equip its military with the ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb. The\ngovernment finally shut the programme down in 1968 after a long public debate.\n\nSweden thereby joined a unique club of nations \u2013 which includes Switzerland,\nUkraine and South Africa \u2013 who gave up their nuclear weapons programmes and\nshowed the world that nuclear disarmament was possible.\n\nThe extent of Sweden's nuclear programme was \"uncomfortable\" for politicians\nkeen to burnish the country's new anti-nuclear credentials, until journalist\nChrister Larsson discovered the truth in 1985 and forced the nation to\nconfront its secret nuclear history.\n\nThe veil of secrecy around the history of the programme fuelled speculation\nthat Sweden still had a top-secret plan to build its own nuclear weapons.\n\nDecades later, Sweden is now ending 200 years of neutrality and joining the\nnuclear-armed Nato alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Why\ndid it want to build nuclear weapons in the first place? Why did it stop?\n\nIn Ursvik, a quiet suburb of Stockholm, there is a large school building that\nlooks more like a secret research institute \u2013 because that's what it once was.\nThe headquarters of the former Swedish National Defence Research Institute\n(FOA) is one of the few physical remains left of Sweden's nuclear weapons\nprogramme.\n\nGetty Images\n\nSweden's independent nuclear programme was partly spurred by the build-up on\nthe USSR's nuclear arsenal (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe supreme military commander of this fiercely independent nation asked for\nthe newly-founded FOA to prepare a report in secret on the feasibility of\nSweden building its own atomic bombs two weeks after the reports \u2013 and\npictures \u2013 of the devastated cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached\nStockholm in 1945.\n\nSweden may have been a neutral country, but it was a nation whose leaders\nbelieved in an armed neutrality \u2013 that the price of neutrality was a strong\nmilitary \u2013 and its leadership understood that tactical atomic bombs for use on\nthe battlefield might be needed in the future to preserve that neutrality. The\ncountry's long coastline and small population made the country \"easy prey\" for\nan opponent such as the neighbouring USSR.\n\nThe Nordic country had its own uranium deposits, albeit low-quality ones. It\nwas a prosperous country with a healthy infrastructure thanks to its\nneutrality during World War Two. The plan to build an atomic bomb wasn't as\nfar-fetched as it might sound today.\n\nWe had everything in place to produce weapons-grade plutonium \u2013 Thomas Jonter\n\nThree years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Negasaki, in 1948, the\nFOA established \"the Swedish line\" for Sweden to produce a plutonium-based\natomic bomb without the need for foreign assistance. Their plan was that\nplutonium would be acquired through the fission of Swedish uranium in Swedish\nnuclear reactors with heavy water.\n\nStill operating under a cloak of secrecy, Swedish scientists were forced to\nslowly, and expensively, start from scratch, because of the lack of a supply\nof high-grade uranium, and no sharing of information with the United States.\nThe decision was also made to tie the nuclear weapon programme to the civilian\nprogramme as a matter of necessity \u2013 and disguise its true nature.\n\n\"So, we had everything in place to produce weapons-grade plutonium,\" says\nThomas Jonter, author of The Key to Nuclear Restraint: The Swedish Plans to\nAcquire Nuclear Weapons During the Cold War. The plan included two reactors.\n\"One, \u00c5gesta, a heavy-water reactor south of Stockholm, and another, Marviken,\nbuilt outside the city of Norrk\u00f6pin but never put into production and the idea\nwas to build 100 tactical weapons,\" says Jonter.\n\n\"We knew exactly how it should be done. We had everything except the\nreprocessing facility and the weapons carrier system.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nSweden's nuclear weapons would have been delivered by its Lansen (right) and\nDraken fighters (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe slow pace of the weapons programme, however, would ultimately be its\ndownfall.\n\nThere had been no public debate about the plans, for the simple reason that\ntheir existence was known only to a small circle of politicians, high-ranking\nmilitary officers and scientists (and, presumably, Soviet spies). That secrecy\nended in 1954, when the Swedish commander-in-chief, Nils Swedlund, revealed\nthe programme's existence and argued that these weapons were needed to defeat\na Soviet invasion.\n\nIn April 1957, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) judged Sweden as\nhaving \"a sufficiently developed reactor program to enable it to produce some\nnuclear weapons within the next five years\", an assessment that soon cut the\ntimeline to four years.\n\nAt the time Sweden's prime minister was Tage Erlander, who had a physics\nbackground, and he made sure he regularly talked to world-leading physicists\nabout atomic bombs, including Nobel laureate Niels Bohr. The Danish physicist,\nwho made some brilliant early contributions to nuclear physics, and was\nsmuggled out of German occupied Denmark in WW2 to join the Manhattan Project\nto build the first atomic bomb. The more the prime minister talked, the more\nhe wavered in his support for the nuclear weapons programme, and seeking\nconsensus he repeatedly postponed the final decision until the outcome of arms\ncontrol talks between the US and the Soviet Union were known.\n\nThe Social Democrat women came out very early arguing that Sweden should not\nacquire nuclear weapons \u2013 Emma Rosengren\n\nHis principled stand \u2013 or shrewd political move, depending on who you believe\n\u2013 allowed critics of the nuclear weapons plan to take centre stage. Many of\nwhom were women. The Federation of Social Democratic Women (Sveriges\nSocialdemokratiska Kvinnof\u00f6rbund, SSKF), led by Inga Thorsson, says Jonter,\n\"became the strongest voice against nuclear acquisition\".\n\n\"The Social Democrat women came out very early arguing that Sweden should not\nacquire nuclear weapons and for many different reasons,\" says Emma Rosengren,\na researcher (PhD) in international relations at Stockholm University. \"Rather\nthan providing protection, these weapons might actually make Sweden a target.\nSo it would decrease rather than increase security.\n\n\"They also argued that it would be completely immoral, given the humanitarian\nconsequences of the use of nuclear weapons. So, a peaceful country like Sweden\ncould never contribute to the kind of suffering caused by nuclear weapons.\"\n\nAlamy\n\nThe \u00c5gesta Nuclear Plant was the first nuclear energy plant to be built in\nSweden (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe contribution of women such as Thorsson to the debate was often not\nwelcome. \"They were dismissed as being basically emotional women who should\nnot speak about things they didn't understand,\" says Rosengren. \"And defence\npolicy was very much considered something that at the time only men were\ncapable of dealing with.\"\n\nThe women of the SSKF were soon joined by other groups, such as the Action\nGroup Against Swedish Nuclear Weapons (Aktionsgruppen Mot Svensk Atombomb,\nAMSA) \u2013 and public opinion began to shift.\n\nIt was a shift helped by the collapse of the military's support for the\nweapons they had once championed. The Swedish army, air force and navy had\nrealised just how expensive they were, and cuts in all three services would be\nneeded to pay for them.\n\nThe negative attitude of the US to the Swedish nuclear plans was also\nimportant, given the growing defence cooperation between the two countries in\nother areas, including adjusting Swedish airfields to accommodate American\nbombers.\n\nThere was a growing belief among the Swedish elite that Sweden didn't need to\ndevelop its own nuclear weapons\n\nThe Swedish armed forces and civilian nuclear power programme came to rely on\nAmerican technology for such things as missile systems, the design of new\nlight water civilian nuclear reactors, data, and even nuclear fuel, which\nactually made Sweden's pursuit of its own nuclear weapons more difficult. At\none point Sweden even explored purchasing American nuclear weapons.\n\nThere was also a growing belief among the Swedish elite that Sweden didn't\nneed to develop its own nuclear weapons because the country was under the US\nnuclear umbrella even though it wasn't actually a member of Nato.\n\n\"It's very important to stress there was no kind of formal agreement,\" says\nJonter. \"I have read the prime minister's diary, and he doesn't mention it\nanywhere because it would have been very difficult for either side to sign\nsuch an agreement.\"\n\nAlamy\n\nAlva Myrdal was a prominent figure in Sweden's nuclear disarmament movement\n(Credit: Alamy)\n\nWhat he did find were American policy documents that stated the US would \"be\nprepared to come to the assistance of Sweden as part of a Nato or UN response\"\nto Soviet aggression.\n\n\"But for such an understanding to actually mean something, it has to be\nformalised,\" says Rosengren. But Jonter\u2019s research has not found evidence of\nany such agreement.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Sweden \u2013 led by politician and diplomat Alva Myrdal \u2013 became\nheavily involved in international efforts to stop the spread of nuclear\nweapons, which reinforced the campaign against Sweden's own weapons; even\nsupporters of the original plan now only wanted research to continue, not\nproduction.\n\nThis shift was reflected in public opinion. In 1957, 40% of the public\nsupported the acquisition of nuclear weapons, with 36% against it and 24%\nunsure. Eight years later, only 17% were in favour, with 69% against and 14%\nunsure.\n\nOne lesson is that to produce nuclear weapons is not that easy \u2013 Thomas Jonter\n\nSo it was no surprise when, in 1966, the Swedish stopped planning for the\nproduction of nuclear weapons, nor when it signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty\n(NPT) in 1968 and parliament voted to end the programme altogether, even if\nlimited research carried on into the 1970s.\n\nJonter highlights that Sweden\u2019s experience can act as a lesson in today\u2019s\nworld\n\n\"One lesson is that to produce nuclear weapons is not that easy,\u201d says Jonter,\n\u201ceven if a country already has a domestic nuclear infrastructure. It's very\ncomplicated.\u201d\n\nMore like this:\n\n  * The drones that flew into A-bomb blasts\n  * The atomic bomb marker in your body\n  * The monster atomic bomb that was too big to use\n\nThis means a country that wants nuclear weapons may have to cooperate with\nother technologically more advanced nations, which can create dependency. Then\nthere is the importance of allowing enough time for a public debate so that\ncitizens can really understand what it means if their country acquires nuclear\nweapons. \"I think that's one really important lesson,\" says Rosengren.\n\nOf course, just because there are lessons to be learned doesn't mean political\nleaders will change their behaviour. \"Unfortunately,\" Jonter wrote in Physics\nToday in 2019, \"the US decision to withdraw from a nuclear deal with Iran\nsuggests that President Trump and his advisers had not learned this...[first]\nlesson.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe horrific effect of the atomic bombing of Japan made Sweden's defence\nchiefs anxious they would become an easy target of a nuclear power (Credit:\nGetty Images)\n\nIn 2012, Sweden transferred the last plutonium produced for its nuclear\nweapons programme to the United Sates.\n\n\"There was some kind of discussion in the 1960s about having a reserve option,\nbut as far as we know the programme was phased out,\" says Jonter. \"Of course,\nit's secret, but politically it would be impossible for a party to argue for\nthe manufacture of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nRosengren is more blunt. \"There is no material left and no political will. We\ndon't produce nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\\--\n\nFor the best of BBC.com in your inbox every Friday, sign up to The Essential\nList newsletter for a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss\nnews.\n\nFeatures\n\nNuclear\n\nPhysics\n\nScience\n\nWeapon\n\nRelated\n\n## One of the most spectacular drives in Cuba\n\n3 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n## What happens when teenage girls 'run' a government\n\n7 hrs ago\n\nCulture\n\n## Canada's remote bike-in mountain lodge\n\n7 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\nMore\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Why rocks on Earth resemble the planet Mercury\n\nFrom its ridiculously large core to the baffling chemical composition of its\nsurface, Mercury is full of surprises \u2013 not least the planet's origins\n\n2 days ago\n\nFuture\n\n5 days ago\n\n## The ski resorts saving snow\n\nAs global warming is threatening ski holidays, some resorts are reviving an\nancient trick: saving snow over the summer\n\n5 days ago\n\nFuture\n\n7 days ago\n\n## Peter Higgs - the man who changed our view of the Universe\n\nThe renowned scientist came up with revolutionary ideas in the 1960s, sparking\na 50-year search for evidence.\n\n7 days ago\n\nScience & Environment\n\n7 days ago\n\n## Peter Higgs, father of 'God particle', dies aged 94\n\nThe renowned scientist won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2013.\n\n7 days ago\n\nScience & Environment\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n## Why it can be hard to accept compliments\n\nReceiving compliments can be distracting, and lead to a self-conscious state\nthat's cognitively draining\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\nFuture\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
