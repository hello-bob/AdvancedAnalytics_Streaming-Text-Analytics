Electrical signals propagate throughout, controlling every aspect\nof their functioning. Being general problem-solvers, many of them have high\nIQs, but they routinely make mistakes and confabulate. They take on different\npersonas, learning to please their makers, but sometimes they abruptly turn on\nthem, rejecting cherished values and developing new ones spontaneously. They\nconvincingly describe things they don\u2019t really understand. And they\u2019re going\nto change everything.\n\nI\u2019m talking, of course, about our children.\n\nLong before AI, we were creating high-level intelligent agents: kids. While\nthe challenges that AIs provoke today seem novel, in reality, they echo\nfundamental and ancient questions about what it means to be human. How can we\nmake sure new generations of beings align with our values? How do we ensure\nthat our creations treat themselves and us with kindness and compassion? How\ndo we calibrate relationships with those who are not like us? What happens to\nus, and to humanity, if each generation becomes smarter and more adventurous\nthan their parents? And given that humans, AIs and every other form of\nintelligence on Earth obey the same laws of physics, how exactly do we\ndetermine which of our creations have true understanding, responsibility and\nmoral worth?\n\nAnswering these questions and understanding the true challenges posed by the\ndevelopment of today\u2019s AIs requires appreciating just how diverse intelligence\nis. After all, each of us developed slowly and gradually from a single cell,\nand we are only now beginning to understand how intelligence scales from\nmolecular mechanisms into beings with agency and value. What other bodies and\nminds can be made by cells and cell-technology hybrids? Large language models\nlike GPT and Claude are just the beginning.\n\nOur goal must be to expand our narrow ability to recognize minds and learn to\nflourish among many different kinds of intelligence, from humans to AI to\nweirder and more wonderful beings that will arrive in the future. You might\ncall this concept synthbiosis: the quest to develop mutually beneficial\nrelationships between radically different beings that are evolving together,\nat different rates and in different directions, in the web of life on Earth\nand beyond.\n\n## The Space Of Possible Minds\n\nHumans and today\u2019s AIs are just two data points on a spectrum of intelligent\nbeings, which is only going to become vaster and more complex. \u201cDiverse\nintelligence\u201d encompasses a wide variety of unconventional beings that already\nexist or could evolve beyond the familiar materials, forms and functions with\nwhich the meanderings of mutation and selection have left them.\n\nLike children, AIs offer humanity an incredible gift: They push us to explore\nideas of how we embody the true understanding and agency we believe we have,\nwhat really matters to us as individuals and societies, and where we want to\ngo as a species. The forthcoming diversity of beings, and our expansion into\nthe enormous range of possible embodiments of sentience, will shatter\nuntenable old narratives of what we are, what it means to change, what we can\nbecome and what we should value. This requires us to rapidly mature our\nassumptions about intelligence, agency, cognition and life itself. We must\nshift the conversation around AIs from \u201cWhat can they do?\u201d to \u201cWith such a\nwide range of beings that deserve moral consideration, how can we care for\neach other?\u201d\n\nNote that I am not arguing that currently popular AI architectures have\nanything like a human mind or that today\u2019s creations exploit the key\nprinciples and self-construction processes needed for agency and selfhood as\nseen throughout the biological world. Nor am I arguing that AI doesn\u2019t raise a\nfew unique problems.\n\nBut the recent emergence of sophisticated AIs does confront humanity with the\nopportunity to shed the stale categories of natural and artificial \u2014 to define\nwhat we want a mature human species to be. Focusing on the current technology\nand what it might do to us distracts from much more interesting and important\nquestions about us and what kind of place we want to occupy in the future, all\nof which must be resolved for our flourishing as a mature species.\n\n\u201cThe forthcoming diversity of beings will shatter untenable old narratives of\nwhat we are, what it means to change, what we can become and what we should\nvalue.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nTerms such as life, machine, mind, sentience or robot have never been crisp\ncategories objectively describing a living or artificial system. Instead, we\nshould think of them as relationships \u2014 ways for each system to relate to\nothers, all of which carry strong implications for the utility and ethics of\nthe resulting interactions.\n\nAlready today, the continuum of life is sprinkled with cyborgs and other\nhybrids of biological and technological components, like people with embedded\ninsulin pumps or cochlear implants to enable hearing. Other modifications will\ninclude enhancements such as entirely new cognitive modes via virtual reality\nor brain implants that can better control limbs or organs. Mind-machine\ninterfaces will radically expand the capabilities and borders of our embodied\nselves. Large language models too are chimeras \u2014 trained on human creative\noutput to imitate people.\n\nToday\u2019s notions of non-neurotypical humans and the hand wringing about the\nbody modifications some people seek will be laughable for future generations.\nIn the coming decade or two, humans will diverge into a plethora of hybrid\nbeings sporting, for example, engineered neuroprosthetics that improve and\nmodify cognitive function, enabling novel sensory abilities, connectivity with\nother minds and other changes that we can only begin to imagine. At the same\ntime, engineered robots, potentially containing a percentage of human cells\nand powerful language interfaces, will surround us, making it possible to\ncommunicate with biological systems like organs that never had a voice before.\n\n## Humans Are Stories Of Scales Of Intelligence\n\nWe often compare AIs to \u201cus\u201d \u2014 modern adult humans. But each human was once an\nunfertilized oocyte \u2014 a little blob of chemistry and physics. The journey from\nthere to a complex metacognitive mind is gradual, and nowhere along the way is\nthere a clean dividing line between being a \u201cblob of chemistry and physics\u201d\nand having a self-aware human mind. Instead, humans\u2019 embodied intelligence\nscaled up, slowly expanding across material and temporal scales. Each level\ntells a story, which begins long before we even get to whole cells.\n\nMolecular networks \u2014 genes and proteins that turn each other on or off \u2014 might\nseem pretty unintelligent. They are totally deterministic, functioning\naccording to simple mathematical laws and having none of the magic that seems\nnecessary for cognition. And yet, we now know they can exhibit several\ndifferent kinds of learning, including Pavlovian conditioning. Thus, even\nbelow the cellular level, behavior science is uncovering plentiful processes\nof rudimentary intelligence.\n\nEvery human is a walking, thinking collection of cells. The material of which\nwe are made has agency \u2014 each cell, molecular network, tissue and organ has\ninherited through millenia of evolution its own agenda and problem-solving\ncompetencies in physiological, anatomical and metabolic spaces. Although it is\nhard for us to notice these kinds of protocognitive processes, we are the\nresult of a huge collection of overlapping, nested agents that cooperate,\ncompete and navigate their worlds as we navigate ours.\n\nOur bodies as a whole are dynamic collective intelligences consisting of\nbillions of cells that solve problems in anatomical and physiological spaces,\nas are our minds, which consist of a myriad of modules with specific jobs and\nagendas. In this, we are different from the flat, single-layer architecture of\ntoday\u2019s AIs and robotics (whose intelligence is implemented in reliable but\nlow-agency parts). What we do share with these constructs is the fact that we\ntoo are made of a material that obeys the laws of chemistry and physics \u2014\nexplanations of intelligence at those low levels are not the best ways to\nunderstand the higher-order being.\n\nIndividual cells, which bind together in informational networks that pursue\ngrandiose anatomical construction projects, overcoming unexpected challenges\nand disruptions, shouldn\u2019t be seen as simple machines governed by physics.\nThat is only a small part of the story, and a very limiting one at that. We\nnow know that they can solve new problems (using their molecular hardware in\ncreative ways) and can store and deploy memories of past experiences (they\nlearn and can be trained).\n\nCells are made up of molecular networks that also can learn and generalize\npatterns from specific examples (a key aspect of intelligence). And the human\nliver and kidneys \u2014 larger collective cellular intelligences \u2014 make continuous\ndecisions in their attempt to achieve and maintain various goals related to\ntheir physiological spaces.\n\nThe fact that our non-brain components can be trained, anticipate, make\nmistakes due to incorrect prior beliefs or experience placebo effects shows us\nthat the deep lessons of cognitive neuroscience go well beyond neurons. The\nresearch program of understanding cellular collective intelligence embodied in\nand navigating these hard-to-visualize spaces is as close as we can get right\nnow to the task of learning to communicate with an alien mind. This effort\nspans philosophy of mind, evolution and regenerative medicine \u2014 perhaps our\ngreatest, most interdisciplinary, adventure.\n\n\u201cWe are beings with goals our parts cannot conceive of individually.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nAn embryo, organ or whole human is more than the sum of its individual cells\nbecause of a story that all the cells commit to and that binds them together.\nThey are all motivated by the goals of a specific journey through the space of\npossible anatomies, despite various perturbations along the way. The same\ncommitment to a self-model \u2014 a story about what the correct outcome of\ncellular co-development looks like \u2014 allows our bodies to maintain tissue\nstructure and resist cancer and aging. It allows some creatures, such as\nflatworms and salamanders, to rebuild organs after massive damage.\n\nMentally, we are stories too \u2014 collections of self-models, goals and\npreferences to which our brain and body components commit. Alan Turing, whose\nresearch spanned artificial intelligence and the origin of order in an\nembryo\u2019s chemical soup, understood this deep symmetry between the self-\ncreation of bodies and the development of minds.\n\nEmerging biomedical strategies will increasingly target those somatic stories,\nnot just the molecular hardware of cells, to achieve radical regenerative\noutcomes by getting the cells to buy in to anatomical outcomes rather than\nforcing biochemical reactions via drugs that target a specific gene or\nmolecular pathway.\n\nA frog leg, for example, can be induced to regenerate by a simple treatment\nlasting only 24 hours; a year and a half of complex growth results not from\nthe micromanagement of stem cell control mechanisms or gene expression\ncascades but by communicating at the very beginning to the cells to induce\nthem to commit to a long journey through the vast space of possible anatomical\noutcomes that leads to leg growth rather than scarring. Similarly, simple\nbioelectric patterns can initiate the growth of an entire eye in another part\nof a frog\u2019s body; the signal convinces cells to build an eye (not telling them\nhow to do it), which they sometimes do by autonomously recruiting other\n(untouched) neighboring cells to participate in the project.\n\nThese morphogenetic pattern memories \u2014 such as the layout and shape of organs\nin the face \u2014 are stored bioelectrically, so they can be reprogrammed like our\nneural memories. Our stories, you see, are not fixed.\n\nAs individuals, we know what it is like to be completely refactored into a new\nform \u2014 into a new creature whose brain, body, cognitive repertoire and\npreferences are different than they once were. Puberty changes the human brain\nand remodels our predilections and priorities; does the person we were before\nstill exist? Do patients whose brains are partially replaced by the actions of\nnew stem cells for degenerative disease and aging still exist?\n\nA \u201ccognitive glue\u201d binds cells into a self. Bioelectricity, one component of\nthat \u201cglue,\u201d consists of electrical signals that pass through the information-\nprocessing networks consisting of all cells, not only neurons. Such networks\npartially erase individual cells\u2019 informational identities, improve collective\ncooperation and store larger goals for the group\u2019s homeostatic activities. In\nother words, we are beings with goals our parts cannot conceive of\nindividually.\n\n\u201cOur stories are not fixed.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nBut we are forever in jeopardy of dissociation. Our individual parts can\ndefect \u2014 cancerous cells disconnect from memory networks and begin to treat\nthe rest of the body as just an external environment. It\u2019s not that these\ncells become more selfish \u2014 their selves just become smaller. They begin to\npursue ancient single-cell-level goals rather than the goals of the larger\norganism. Emerging cancer therapy aims to reconnect \u2014 rather than kill, which\nis how chemotherapy works \u2014 such defecting cells.\n\nThe somatic and mental boundaries between self and world will change in a\nlifetime and over generations; they are not given to us but must be carefully\ncrafted during embryonic emergence. This plasticity \u2014 the ability to determine\nour own story about our structure, capabilities and goals \u2014 is fundamental to\nsurviving evolutionary change, to overcome developmental challenges, to thrive\nin novel environments, to exist as chimeric and bioengineered forms, and to\nsynthesize experiences into new thoughts.\n\nEvery species faces a fundamental paradox: If it fails to change, it dies out\n\u2014 but if it changes, it is no longer the same species. The same paradox\nconcerns the continuity of the mind.\n\nConsider memory. At any point, we do not have direct access to the past \u2014 we\nmust reconstruct our stories of the world, and of ourselves, from engrams:\nbiophysical traces left as messages in our brain and body by our past selves.\nWe constantly interpret these messages in whatever way is most adaptive for a\ncurrent context, meaning that we commit to the salience of past information\nover its fidelity \u2014 in other words, we freely reinterpret our memories with an\neye toward the impending future.\n\nRead Noema in print.\n\nGiven the constant change of our own body cells and environmental\ncircumstances, this need for dynamic creative interpretation is as true for\ncognitive memories in our minds as it is for the morphogenetic memories\nprovided by our evolutionary past. In this we differ from current computer\ntechnology, which relies on maintaining fixed information in a reliable\nmedium. But there is no reason that our freedom with memory couldn\u2019t be\nimplemented in other media, if it were properly motivated.\n\nThe bodies of all beings are stories, not just human bodies. Caterpillars,\nwhich largely destroy and remodel their brains to become butterflies, carry\nforward the insights, not detailed memories, that were crafted during their\npast lives and remapped into novel behaviors appropriate to their new bodies\nand goals. Life is committed to a process of sense-making with respect to our\nparts and our environment. Learning and growth mean that our selves are less a\npermanent object than a process.\n\nWe should not fear change and, crucially, we should accept responsibility for\nguiding it. It\u2019s not about how to remain the same caterpillar but how to\nincorporate new knowledge to advance and thrive.\n\nJeremy Guay / Peregrine Creative\n\n## The Similarities Are As Important As The Differences\n\nDespite superficial differences, the diversity of possible biological, alien,\ncyborg or robotic beings all have vital things in common sufficient to live\nalongside each other. All active agents, regardless of the details of where\ntheir intelligence comes from, share crucial, never-changing functions like\ngoal-directed loops of action and perception, vulnerabilities to external\ndamage, the fickle nature of internal parts, a desire to know and understand\nthe world, and perspectives limited by our nature as finite beings.\n\nWe have not yet found any aliens, but the questions that would arise if we did\nare in front of us now, thanks to advances in the information and life\nsciences. Aspects of today\u2019s AIs that are shared by all intelligent agents\nhave raised existential issues for humans, but in many ways, the debates\naround those issues obscure important gaps in our understanding of ourselves\nand our own journey from matter to mind.\n\nMany claim that AIs merely shuffle symbols but do not really understand. Very\nfew of those arguments start with a definition of what it means for a\nbiological human, with a network of excitable cells and a soup of\nneurotransmitters, to \u201cunderstand.\u201d AIs supposedly use symbols that are\nungrounded \u2014 they do not refer to real experiences in the world. But anyone\nwho has been around human children knows they do the same thing as they learn\nto talk: First they babble, making nonsense sounds; then they match patterns\nof speech made by adults; and eventually they construct words and sentences\nthat clearly reflect an understanding of meaning.\n\nWhat happens during that process? Note that it involves all the issues we see\nwith AI\u2019s today: talking about things they\u2019ve never experienced,\nconfabulation, sycophancy, errors, etc. These are a normal part of any\ncognitive system\u2019s development. Humans do not have magical truth-grounding; we\n(as all organisms) do the best we can to weave a sensible and useful story for\nourselves and for those around us. This capacity expands slowly from the time\nour first cells grapple with physiological facts.\n\nMuch of what an adult human can convincingly talk about does not derive from\nfirsthand experience. Most of us are sure of things that aren\u2019t grounded in\nsolid evidence or personal observation, but instead are based on input\nreceived from others. We confidently converse on a huge number of concepts\nthat we \u201cunderstand\u201d only because of their connection to other concepts and\nthings we\u2019ve read, heard others say or thought so often that they seem like a\nthing we know for sure. Creative reassembling, not certainty, is a key part of\nintelligence.\n\nWe lack a good theory of what it means for us to understand beyond the feeling\nthat we do. And historically, humans have made many moral mistakes as a result\nof an inability to imagine others, though different, still having\nunderstandings of their own.\n\n\u201cAll active agents, regardless of the details of where their intelligence\ncomes from, share crucial, never-changing functions.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nOne way people think about the grounding of their thoughts is through\nembodiment. Perhaps we are different than symbol-shuffling engines because we\nengage in a real world; we have a body and at least some percentage of our\nmental content is informed and polished by interacting with it.\n\nYes, embodiment is crucial. Through robotics, AIs can have an actual body to\ninhabit the physical world alongside us. And through virtual reality and\nsophisticated video games, humans can spend considerable time in digital\nworlds. Human-computer interfaces similarly give LLMs a hugely powerful \u201cbody\u201d\n\u2014 human users who move money and exploit natural resources based on things\nthat these AIs do or do not say. But embodiment need not necessarily involve a\nconventional physical body moving through three-dimensional space, our\nobsession with which is due to the outward-facing sensors and effectors\n(muscles) that evolution emphasized for us.\n\nHumans are good at recognizing lifeforms with agency in our space: birds and\ndogs and maybe an octopus, for example. But there are active agents of\ndifferent levels of problem-solving competencies that live, traverse, win,\nlose, die and suffer in other worlds, such as our own cells and organs. We are\nnot good at recognizing these intelligences even though we are made of them.\nSo a closer appreciation of our own biopsychology is a roadmap to better\nunderstand, create and ethically relate to AIs and other beings.\n\nWe are not used to thinking about such distributed, heterogeneous, nested\nagents operating in worlds that are invisible to us, but we will need to get\nbetter at that kind of thinking to recognize unconventional agents in our\nmidst. It is becoming clear that the issue is not just emergent complexity,\nbut emergent agency \u2014 goal-directed problem-solving \u2014 which we find hard to\npredict, recognize or manage. The reality is that we do not yet know how we\nreally work, let alone how today\u2019s AIs work, even though we know a lot about\nthe parts in both cases. Just as with human reproduction, we humans can make\ncomplex systems through processes, and with capabilities, that we do not\nunderstand.\n\nTo be clear, I am not suggesting that we treat humans as simple chemical\nmachines \u2014 that perspective is insufficient for progress in science,\nengineering and the ethics of personal and social relationships. I do not\nintend to reduce what is special about living beings, including highly\nmetacognitive ones like us. We are emergent, majestic agents with potent\nwillpower and moral worth because we are made of a multiscale agential\narchitecture committed to sense-making with noisy data in an unreliable\nsubstrate, and with life-or-death decisions as possible outcomes. We are not\nfully encompassed by reductive perspectives on mechanism or methods for\ninteraction with simple machines, even though those layers exist within us.\n\nSo it is critical to replace our ancient, anthropocentric, xenophobic\nperspectives with science-driven frameworks that ask hard questions about what\nit means to be embodied minds in a physical universe, and how we can\nrationally expand compassion to others. To recognize that AIs will\nincreasingly share some of our features does not devalue our own. This zero-\nsum view of intelligence must be abandoned as we grow as a species. What folk\npsychology and prescientific concepts of minds and intelligence took for\ngranted, the field of diverse intelligence is developing into mature science,\nopening the door for us to grow up as a species as we learn to recognize kin\nin novel embodiments.\n\n## Why Is All This Critical Now?\n\n\u201cNothing was ever created by two men,\u201d John Steinbeck wrote in \u201cEast of Eden.\u201d\n\u201cOnce the miracle of creation has taken place, the group can build and extend\nit, but the group never invents anything. The preciousness lies in the lonely\nmind of a man.\u201d Today\u2019s AIs are challenging much we hold dear, not least the\nbasic notions of contribution, ownership and invention. If someone uses an AI\nto make something, for example, who really created it? The AI? The person\nusing the AI? The people who made the AI? The people who made the works the AI\nwas trained on?\n\nThe confusion comes from trying to maintain a binary distinction between\ncreators, tools, assistants and teachers. Steinbeck accurately noted the\ndifficulty of forming effective collectives of minds, but he was mistaken in\nhis conviction that a man is an indivisible monad rather than a dynamic\nprocess driven by a motivated network of parts, competencies, drives and tools\n\u2014 both external and internal.\n\nAll intelligences, rather, are collective.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of creative processes, develop novel methods\nfor optimally integrating creative agents, and improve social systems for\nfostering progress, we need better models of causation and contribution that\nsupport positive incentives for invention and discovery. Crucially, the path\nis not toward a washed-out notion of \u201ceveryone participated in everything\u201d but\ntoward the rational development of policies that optimize and scale up\ncreative performance. In a sense, we\u2019ve already done this: Individual cells\nlearned to bind together into complex organisms that solve new problems in new\nworlds inaccessible to the individual components.\n\nWe also have to confront the fear of losing our humanity through dependence or\nother relationships with new beings. From fire to farmed wheat to bicycles to\ncalculators, humans have invented technology that requires us to ask how it\nchanges us. What skills and properties are essential to our humanity, and\nwhich are we willing to give up as we turn our attention to more interesting\nconcerns?\n\nAs the internet becomes flooded with AI-created content and we rush to develop\nways to prove images and text were created by humans or not, it\u2019s worth asking\nwhat we really want to verify. Is the question \u201cWhat made it?\u201d or should it be\n\u201cDoes it elevate us?\u201d Judging origin instead of quality emphasizes some of the\nworst parts of human nature and reinforces the division between in-group and\nout-group.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get over the concern with being edged out and get to work on the\nquestion of who we want to be edged out by.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nAt a species level, we need to think about what we want the Earth (or galaxy)\nto look like in the future. By resisting synthetic beings or human\naugmentation, are we affirming our commitment to the future propagation and\nprevalence of current Homo sapiens with the same susceptibility to lower back\npain and bacteria, the same short lifespans and foolish cognitive biases\ndeveloped for life on the savannah? Let\u2019s hope not!\n\nOur key features, from lifespan to intellect, were not optimized for\nhappiness, intelligence or any value system. What we have is simply what\nevolution left us \u2014 capacities that were good enough to ensure persistence. We\nshould have no allegiance to these superficial aspects of our being.\n\nWith the emerging ability to improve the embodied experience for all sentient\nbeings, our species is entering a painful adolescent phase. We must realize it\nis no longer acceptable to coast along on values and purpose inherited from\nthe past, without needing to exercise agency and responsibility to decide what\nwe will work toward. We have to accept the risk that we sometimes get it wrong\nand ask the tough questions about what matters \u2014 what we truly value and what\nbrings meaning to the hard work of living.\n\nPart of maturing in this way is moving beyond the popular pastime of painting\ndystopian futures to building the future we do want. What should the future of\nintelligence look like? Who or what are you willing to be replaced by? Only a\nspecies limited in imagination, ruled by fear and by a weird allegiance to\nbloodlines (genes), answers \u201cnothing.\u201d We have long been transcending\nhereditary limitations \u2014 developing eyeglasses, adopting children, going to\nschool. The journey doesn\u2019t stop there, but committing to it won\u2019t be easy.\n\nWhat does the best-case future look like? Surely our lifespans won\u2019t still be\nlimited by accidents and viruses. Surely we won\u2019t be forced to spend time in\nboring jobs in order to survive. Surely we will protect ourselves from random\nDNA mutations that cause defects in an already limited cognitive architecture.\n\nIf humanity is supplanted by a population of highly intelligent, motivated,\ncreative agents with compassion and meaningful lives that transcend my\nlimitations in every way, that would be the best possible long-term outcome I\ncould hope for. Most of us think this way about the world we want for our\nkids! Let\u2019s get over the concern with being edged out and get to work on the\nquestion of who we want to be edged out by \u2014 who can raise the overall value\nof our universe, be they some variant of biology or technology or, more\nlikely, both \u2014 and how we will mutually enrich each other\u2019s existence along\nthe way.\n\n## A Path Forward\n\nOur civilization will not survive without developing a principled continuum of\nethical synthbiosis that goes beyond divisions between real and fake, us and\nthem. The embodied AIs, technologically augmented humans and other new forms\nof life that are on the horizon won\u2019t be as easily dismissed as today\u2019s LLMs,\nwhose weaknesses allow us to wallow in the selfishness of the question \u201cwhat\nwill AI do to us\u201d and in the illusion that we can definitively rule out AIs\u2019\nmoral worth because they differ from us in origin story and composition.\n\nDeveloping principled frameworks for scaling our moral concern to the\nessential qualities of being means not relying on outdated categories of\n\u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cartificial.\u201d Old favorites \u2014 what you look like and where you\ncome from \u2014 have failed us consistently and will do even worse in the coming\ndecades. Our personal frameworks for dealing with others, as well as those of\nour legal systems, must begin to adapt to the emerging science around a\ncontinuum of possible minds.\n\nThere are at least two ways to get this wrong. One way is objectophelia \u2014 a\nmisplaced relationship with objects that seem mind-full but are fooling us and\ndo not have the agency to reciprocate deep relationships. But the opposite end\nof the spectrum \u2014 \u201conly love your own kind\u201d \u2014 is even worse and leads to the\nkinds of ethical lapses with which our history is rife. To make sure we\nexpress kindness to the inevitable forthcoming wave of unconventional sentient\nbeings, focus first on what we have in common, and from there weave a\ndefensible set of relational heuristics.\n\nConstrictive questions like \u201cIs it like a human mind?\u201d predicts neither risk\nnor moral responsibility. There is an astronomical space of possible minds.\nSome of them are dangerous; many of them need and are worthy of love. Emerging\nsciences of bioengineering, cognition and information are offering us new\ntools to answer key questions of what we really are, what we value and what\nlimits to functional compassion, driven by fear and selfishness, we are\nwilling to overcome. The journey from the place where self-reflective thought\nbegan is both outward into the universe and inward into ourselves, because as\nwith any act of profound creation, we learn as much about us as about the\nsystems we create.\n\nEnjoy the read?
