Now it's a national joke.\n\nBy Chris Taylor on April 19, 2024\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard\n\nTesla's CEO introduces the Cybertruck in 2019. Credit: Frederic J. Brown/ AFP\nvia Getty Images\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck was supposed to stop bullets. Turns out its owners should\nbe more afraid of a bit of soap.\n\nAn \"unapproved lubricant\" used on the Cybertruck's accelerator pad caused it\nto slip off and get trapped in a bit of trim above the pedal, according to a\nrecall report [PDF] by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If\nyou've been on TikTok this week, you might have seen what that can mean,\nthanks to a viral video of a Cybertruck owner whose accelerator jammed in the\n\"pedal to the metal\" position.\n\nSEE ALSO: Tesla recalls all 3,878 Cybertrucks due to stuck accelerator pedal\nissue\n\nResult: Every single driver who paid for a Cybertruck, all 3,878 of them, now\nhas to haul their extremely angular EV to their local dealer in Tesla's\nbiggest recall to date. And as with a lot of news these days, how you react to\nthe recall likely depends on whether you're an obsessive fan of Elon Musk.\n\nThe \"masterful gambit, sir\" crowd can easily play it down. After all, no one\ndied. Nobody has even crashed, that we know of, as a result of this error.\nTesla has offered a prompt fix (well, 20 days after it received its first\ncustomer complaint about the pedal, so prompt-ish). The lubricant-toting\nworkers are at fault, not the company. Besides, look at the ongoing disaster\nat Boeing, which approved the use of dish soap in manufacturing the same door\nseal that blew off during a 737 Max flight in January.\n\nNext to Boeing, Tesla looks like a paragon of soapy safety.\n\nAnd yet judging by the ongoing slide of Tesla stock, which reached a one-year\nlow after news of the Cybertruck recall hit Wall Street on Friday, not\neveryone takes this view. After all, it's not the workers' fault someone told\nthem to put a completely unnecessary rugged-look pad on the accelerator. Nor\nshould workers be blamed for rust marks appearing on a stainless steel truck,\nor a trunk that can pinch fingers, or a warning not to wash it in direct\nsunlight, or a flashing red \"pull over\" notice appearing on its screen minutes\nafter at least one customer started driving.\n\n## A punchline on wheels\n\nCrucially for Tesla's future, we may have reached a tipping point: The\nCybertruck has become a punchline in a way that its owners cannot get out from\nunder. The joke is that they are dupes who paid through the nose for an\nextremely expensive vehicle that looks like it was designed by a child and\ndoes not actually perform many of the functions we expect from a truck, and\nthat they'll put up with any design flaw whatsoever.\n\nYou can see this clearly in the most-liked, and highly representative, comment\non that viral TikTok. \"Every Cybertruck owner is like 'I paid 80k for this and\nit almost killed my entire family. Small issue. Love the car!'\"\n\nActually, the owner responded, he paid $122,000 with extras.\n\n\"Sick flex, brother,\" replied another TikTok user. \"I also paid $122k to be a\nludicrously irresponsible threat to any vehicle or pedestrian in my vicinity.\"\n\nCybertruck comedy, still legal, continued over on Musk's Twitter (which, in\ncommon with Stephen King and at least one potential juror in the Manhattan\ntrial of Donald Trump, we still refuse to call X).\n\nTracy Chapman's signature hit provided the perfect joke ...\n\n> Tweet may have been deleted\n\n... while the notion of the Cybertruck as a \"snowflake\" vehicle that cannot\nencounter any real-world conditions took hold.\n\n> Tweet may have been deleted\n\nPerhaps most devastating for Musk: Dril, one of the most beloved accounts on\nthe service, chose this moment for his first Cybertruck tweet.\n\n> Tweet may have been deleted\n\nThe recall also revealed, inadvertently, how far short of Musk's ambition the\nCybertruck has fallen thus far. The CEO estimated 250,000 Cybertruck sales per\nyear in a recent earnings call. It's fair to say that 4,000 Cybertrucks\ndelivered in the first 6 months is a little short of that goal. Not only is\nthat 10 times less than the number of Rivian EV trucks sold so far \u2014 and just\nto be clear, Rivian is in trouble too \u2014 it's also less than half the total\nnumber of Deloreans sold in the U.S. in the 1980s.\n\nThe Delorean was a stainless-steel flop that sent the automaker behind it into\nbankruptcy, despite the car later earning a star turn in Back to the Future.\nTesla, the world's largest EV manufacturer, is clearly in a better position.\nStill, like John Delorean, Musk seems to have bet the future of his company on\nthis quirky vehicle.\n\nTesla could not have chosen a worse time to ask shareholders to reinstate a\n$56 billion compensation package for the CEO that a judge already struck down.\nThe company's second-largest shareholder, a self-described \"Elon fanboy,\" just\nannounced he is voting against.\n\nThe result of that vote, in June, may decide where this chaotic company and\nits mercurial CEO is going next. By then, the supply of Cybertrucks on our\nroads may have dwindled down as the recall goes into effect.\n\nOur national reserves of schadenfreude, meanwhile, have never looked\nhealthier.\n\nTopics Tesla Elon Musk\n\nChris Taylor\n\nChris is a veteran tech, entertainment and culture journalist, author of 'How\nStar Wars Conquered the Universe,' and co-host of the Doctor Who podcast 'Pull\nto Open.'
