The authors analyzed over 20,000 college\napplication essays from a large public university that attracts students from\na range of racial, cultural, and economic backgrounds and found that the\nsemantic volume of the writing, or how much ground an application essay\ncovered predicted college performance, as measured by grade point average.\nEssays that covered more semantic ground predicted higher grades. Similarly,\nessays with smaller conceptual jumps between successive parts of its discourse\npredicted higher grades. These trends held even when researchers controlled\nfor factors including SAT score, parents\u2019 education, gender, ethnicity,\ncollege major, essay topics, and essay length. Some of these factors, such as\nparents\u2019 education and the student\u2019s SAT scores, encode information about\nfamily background, suggesting that the linguistic features of semantic volume\nand speed are not determined solely by socioeconomic status. According to the\nauthors, the results demonstrate that the topography of thought, or the way\npeople express and organize their ideas, can provide insight into their likely\nfuture success.\n\n#### Journal\n\nPNAS Nexus\n\n#### Article Title\n\nThe topography of thought\n\n#### Article Publication Date\n\n7-May-2024\n\nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news\nreleases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of\nany information through the EurekAlert system.\n\nMedia Contacts\n\nJonah Berger University of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School\njberger@wharton.upenn.edu Office: +1 415-305-6971\n\nOlivier Toubia Columbia Business School Ot2107@gsb.columbia.edu Office: +1\n917-340-6251\n\n### More on this News Release\n\n### Using AI to predict GPA from college application essays\n\nPNAS Nexus\n\nJournal\n\n    PNAS Nexus\n\n#### Keywords\n\n#### Original Source\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article-\nlookup/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae163\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS)\n\n  * facebook.com/EurekAlert\n  * @EurekAlert\n  * youtube.com/EurekAlert\n\n  * Help / FAQ\n  * Services\n  * Eligibility Guidelines\n  * Contact EurekAlert!\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * DMCA\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Disclaimer\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
