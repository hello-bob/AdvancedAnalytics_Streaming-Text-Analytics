A big part of your social fabric were the kids who went to the same\nchurch that you did, the people you would gravitate towards in a new social\nsituation. The more rural and working class your family was, the less likely\nyou actually went to a church on a regular basis. You'd see them on Christmas\nand Easter, but they weren't really part of the \"church group\".\n\nMy friend Mark was in this group. His family lived in an underground house\nnext to their former motorcycle shop that had closed down when his dad died.\nIt was an hour walk from my house to his through a beautiful forest filled\nwith deer. I was often stuck within eyesight of the house as a freight train\nslowly rolled through in front of me, sitting on a tree stump until the train\npassed. The former motorcycle shop had a Dr. Pepper machine in front of the\nsoaped windows I had a key to and we'd sneak in to explore the shop on\nsleepovers while his mom worked one of her many jobs.\n\nWhat I mean when I say \"underground house\"\n\nShe was a chain-smoker who rarely spoke, often lighting one cigarette with the\nburning cherry of the first as she drove us to the local video store to rent a\nvideogame. Mark's older brother also lived in the house, but rarely left his\nroom. Mostly it was the two of us bouncing around unsupervised, watching old\nmovies and drinking way too much soda as his German Shepard wheezed and\ncoughed in the cigarette smoke filled house.\n\nFamilies like this were often targeted by Evangelical Christians, groups that\noften tried to lure families in with offers of youth groups that could\nentertain your kids while you worked. At some point, one of the youth pastors\nconvinced Mark's mom that she should send both of us to his church. Instead of\nBlockbuster, we got dropped off in front of an anonymous steel warehouse\nstructure with a cross and a buzzing overhead light on a dark country road\nsurrounded by cornfields. Mark hadn't really been exposed to religion, with\nhis father and mother having been deep into biker culture. I had already seen\nthese types of places before and was dreading what I knew came next.\n\nWhen we walked in, we were introduced to \"Pastor Michael\", who looked a bit\nlike if Santa Claus went on an extreme diet and bought serial killer glasses.\nMark bounced over and started asking him questions, but I kept my distance. I\nhad volunteered the year before to fix up an old train station which involved\na large crew of youth \"supervised\" by the fundamentalist Christian church that\nwanted to turn the train station into a homeless shelter. We slept on the\nfloors of the middle school in this smaller town neighboring mine, spending\nour days stripping paint and sanding floors and our evenings being lectured\nabout the evils of sex and how America was in a \"culture war\". In retrospect I\nfeel like there should have been more protective gear in removing lead paint\nas child labor, but I guess that was up to God.\n\nAfter one of these long sessions where we were made to stand up and promise we\nwouldn't have sex before we got married, I made a joke in the walk back to our\nassigned classroom and was immediately set upon by the senior boy in the\ngroup. He had a military style haircut and he threw me against a locker hard\nenough that I saw stars. I had grown up going to Catholic school and mass\nevery Sunday, spending my Wednesday nights going to CCD (Confraternity of\nChristian Doctrine), which was like Sunday school for Catholics. All of this\nwas to say I had pretty established \"Christian\" credentials. This boy let me\nknow he thought I was a bad influence, a fake Christian and that I should be\ncareful since I'd be alone with him and his friends every night in the locked\nclassroom. The experience had left me extremely wary of these Evangelical\ncults as I laid silently in my sleeping bag on the floor of a classroom,\nlistening to a hamster running in a wheel that had clearly been forgotten.\n\nTo those of you not familiar with this world, allow me to provide some\ncontext. My Catholic education presented a very different relationship with\nholy figures. God spoke directly to very few people, saints mostly. There were\nmany warnings growing up about not falling into the trap of believing you were\nsuch a person, worthy of a vision or a direct conversation with a deity. It\nwas suggested softly this was more likely mental illness than divine\nintervention. He enters your heart and changes your behavior and gives you\npeace, but you aren't in that echelon of rare individuals for whom a chat was\njustified. So to me these Evangelicals claiming they could speak directly with\nGod was heresy, a gross blasphemy where random \"Pastors\" were claiming they\nwere saints.\n\nThe congregation started to file in and what would follow was one of the most\nsurreal two hours of my life. People I knew, the woman who worked at the\nlibrary and a local postal worker started to scream and wave their arms,\nblaming their health issues on Satan. Then at one point Scary Santa Claus\nstarted to shake and jerk, looking a bit like he was having a seizure. He\nstarted to babble loudly, moving around the room and I stared as more and more\npeople seemed to pretend this babbling meant something and then doing it\nthemselves. The bright lights and blaring music seemed to have worked these\nnormal people into madness.\n\nIn this era before cell phones, there wasn't much I could do to leave the\nsituation. I waited and watched as Mark became convinced these people were\nchanneling the voice of God. \"It's amazing, I really felt something in there,\nthere was an energy in the room!\" he whispered to me as I kept my eyes on the\ndoor. One of the youth pastors asked me if I felt the spirit moving through\nme, that I shouldn't resist the urge to join in. I muttered that I was ok and\nsaid I had to go to the bathroom, then waited in the stall until the service\nwrapped up almost two hours later.\n\nIn talking to the other kids, I couldn't wrap my mind around the reality that\nthey believed this. \"It's the language of God, only a select few can\nunderstand what the Holy Spirit is saying through us\". The language was all\npowerful, allowing the Pastor to reveal prophesy to select members of the\nChurch and assist them with their financial investments. This was a deadly\nserious business that these normal people completely believed, convinced this\nnonsense jabbering that would sometimes kind of sound like language was\nliterally God talking through them.\n\nI left confident that normal, rational people would never believe such\nnonsense. These people were gullible and once I got out of this dead town I'd\nnever have to be subjected to this level of delusion. So imagine my surprise\nwhen, years later, I'm sitting in an giant conference hall in San Francisco as\nthe CEO of Google explains to the crowd how AI is the future. This system that\nstitched together random words was going to replace all of us in the crowd,\nsolve global warming, change every job. This was met with thunderous applause\nby the group, apparently excited to lose their health insurance. All this had\nbeen kicked off with techno music and bright lights, a church service with a\nbigger budget.\n\nEvery meeting I went to was filled with people ecstatic about the possibility\nof replacing staff with this divine text generator. A French venture\ncapitalist who shared a Uber with me to the original Google campus for\nmeetings was nearly breathless with excitement. \"Soon we might not even need\nprogrammers to launch a startup! Just a founder and their ideas getting out to\nmarket as fast as they can dream it.\" I was tempted to comment that it seemed\nmore likely I could replace him with an LLM, but it felt mean. \"It is going to\nchange the world\" he muttered as we sat in a Tesla still being driven by a\nhuman.\n\nIt has often been suggested by religious people in my life that my community,\nthe nonreligious tech enthusiasts, use technology as a replacement for\nreligion. We reject the fantastical concept of gods and saints only to replace\nthem with delusional ideas of the future. Self-driving cars were inevitable\nuntil it became clear that the problem was actually too hard and we quietly\nstopped talking about it. Establishing a colony on Mars is often discussed as\nif it is \"soon\", even if the idea of doing so far outstrips what we're capable\nof doing by a factor of 10. We tried to replace paper money with a digital\ncurrency and managed to create a global Ponzi scheme that accelerated the\ndestruction of the Earth.\n\nTypically I reject this logic. Technology, for its many faults, also produces\na lot of things with actual benefits which is not a claim religion can make\nmost of the time. But after months of hearing this blind faith in the power of\nAI, the comparisons between what I was hearing now and what the faithful had\nsaid to me after that service was eerily similar. Is this just a mass\ndelusion, a desperate attempt by tech companies to convince us they are still\nworth a trillion dollars even though they have no new ideas? Is there anything\nhere?\n\n### Glossolalia\n\nGlossolalia, the technical term for speaking in tongues, is an old tradition\nwith a more modern revival. It is a trademark of the Pentecostal Church,\nusually surrounded by loud music, screaming prayers and a leader trying to\nwhip the crowd into a frenzy. Until the late 1950s it was confined to a few\nextreme groups, but since then has grown into a more and more common fixture\nin the US. The cultural interpretation of this trend presents it as a\n\u201cheavenly language of the spirit\u201d accessible only to the gifted ones.\nGlossolalists often report an intentional or spontaneous suspension of will to\nconvey divine messages and prophecies.\n\nIn the early 1900s W. J. Seymour, a minister in the US, started to popularize\nthe practice of whipping his congregation into a frenzy such that they could\nspeak in tongues. This was in Los Angeles and quickly became the center of the\nmovement. For those who felt disconnected from religion in a transplant city,\nit must have been quite the experience to feel your deity speaking directly\nthrough you.\n\nIt's Biblical basis is flimsy at best however. Joel 2:28-9 says:\n\n> And afterwards I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and\n> daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, young men will see\n> visions. Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit\n> in those days.\n\nA lot of research has been done into whether this speech is a \"language\", with\nfascinating results. In the Psychology of Speaking in Tongues, Kildahl and\nQualben attempted to figure that out. Their conclusions were that while it\ncould sound like a language, it was a gibberish, closer to the fake language\nchildren use to practice the sounds of speaking. To believers though, this\npresented no problems.\n\n> He argued that glossolalia is real and that it is a gift from the Holy\n> Spirit. He argued that a person cannot fake tongues. Tongues are an initial\n> evidence of the spirit baptism. It is a spiritual experience. He observed\n> that tongues cannot be understood by ordinary people. They can only be\n> understood spiritually. He noted that when he speaks in tongues he feels out\n> of himself. The feeling is very strange. One can cry, get excited, and\n> laugh. As our respondent prayed, he uttered: Hiro---shi---shi---sha---a---\n> karasha. He jumped and clapped his hands in excitement and charisma. He\n> observed that if God allows a believer to speak in tongues there is a\n> purpose for that. One can speak in tongues and interpret them at the same\n> time. However, in his church there is no one who can interpret tongues.\n> According to our respondent, tongues are intended to edify a person. Tongues\n> are beneficial to the person who speaks in tongues. A person does not choose\n> to pray in tongues. Tongues come through the Spirit of God. When speaking in\n> tongues, it feels as if one has lost one's memory. It is as if one is drunk\n> and the person seems to be psychologically disturbed. This is because of the\n> power of the influence of the Holy Spirit. Tongues are a special visitation\n> symbolising a further special touch of the Holy Spirit. Source\n\nIn reality glossolalic speech is not a random and disorganized production of\nsounds. It has specific accents, intonations and word-like units that\nresembles the original language of the speaker. [source] That doesn't make it\nlanguage though, even if the words leave the speaker feeling warm and happy.\n\nWhat it actually is, at its core, is another tool the Evangelical machine has\nat its disposal to use the power of music and group suggestion to work people\ninto a frenzy.\n\n> The tongue-speaker temporarily discards some of his or her ego functioning\n> as it happens in such times as in sleep or in sexual intercourse.^41 This\n> phenomenon was also noticed in 2006 at the University of Pennsylvania, USA,\n> by researchers under the direction of Andrew Newburg, MD who completed the\n> world's first brain-scan study of a group of Pentecostal practitioners while\n> they were speaking in tongues. The researchers noticed that when the\n> participants were engaged in glossolalia, activity in the language centres\n> of the brain actually decreased, while activity in the emotional centres of\n> the brain increased. The fact that the researchers observed no changes in\n> any language areas, led them to conclude that this phenomenon suggests that\n> glossolalia is not associated with usual language function or usage.\n\nSource\n\nIt's the power of suggestion. You are in a group of people and someone, maybe\na plant, kicks it off. You are encouraged to join in and watch as your peers\nenthusiastically get involved. The experience has been explained as positive,\nso of course you remember it as a positive experience, even if in your core\nyou understand that you weren't \"channeling voices\". You can intellectually\nknow it is a fake and still feel moved by the experience.\n\n### LLMs\n\nLLMs, large language models, which have been rebranded as AI, share a lot with\nthe Evangelical tool. AI was classically understood to be a true artificial\nintelligence, a thinking machine that actually processed and understood your\nrequest. It was seen as the Holy Grail of computer science, the ability to\ntake the best of human intellect and combine it into an eternal machine that\ncould guide and help us. This definition has leaked from the sphere of\ntechnology and now solidly lives on in Science Fiction, the talking robot who\ncan help and assist the humans tasked with something.\n\nIf that's the positive spin, then there has always been a counter argument.\nKnown as the \"Chinese room argument\" as shorthand, it says that a digital\ncomputer running code cannot have a mind, understanding or consciousness. You\ncan create a very convincing fake though. The thought experiment is as\nfollows:\n\nYou've made a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes\nChinese characters as input and returns Chinese characters as output. It does\nso at such a high level that it passes the Turing test in that a native\nChinese speaker believes the thing it is speaking to is a human being speaking\nChinese. But the distinction is that the machine doesn't understand Chinese,\nit is simulating the idea of speaking Chinese.\n\nSearle suggests if you put him into a room with an English version of the\nprogram he could receive the same characters through a slot in the door,\nprocess them according to the code and produce Chinese characters as output,\nwithout understanding anything that is being said. However he still wouldn't\nspeak or understand Chinese.\n\nThis topic has been discussed at length by experts, so if you are interested\nin the counterarguments I suggest the great site by Stanford:\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/\n\n### What Is An AI?\n\nThe Neural Networks powering AI at a high level look as follows:\n\nThe magic part of AI is the Transformer neural network, which uses self-\nattention to process not just the elements of text on their own but the way\nthe data relates to each other. It has been fed enough examples to be able to\ntake the input and produce a likely output. Effectively by ingesting every\nwork spoken by humans on video or written on the internet, it can predict with\nsome level of accuracy what a common collection of words to return to a query\nis.\n\nThe end result is a box that consumes a frightening amount of electricity to\nmimic the responses of an all-knowing eternal AI. The believers can commune\ndirectly with this machine spirit, asking it questions and getting back blocks\nof text or pictures that sometimes look like something a human would make. You\ncannot question the model or work backwards to determine how specifically it\ncame to the conclusion it did. There is an element of the divine in the\nprocess, a specter of magic.\n\n### Hallucination\n\nAs AI was introduced, we were cautioned to be on the lookout for\n\"hallucinations\", where the model would produce convincing-looking fakes. The\nproblem with this warning is it both flies in the face of how humans work\n(we're not amazing at questioning authoritative-sounding answers) and also\nsuggested this was a temporary problem. But the more you read about AI, you\nrealize it can never solve the hallucination problem because it would need to\nunderstand what is \"real\" and \"fake\" in order to do that.\n\nWhat do I mean on a practical level? So I thought I would test out the Google\nGemini AI with some easy questions. I had recently written a bash script to\nquery GCP cloud deployments to get their status and write them to markdown.\nThis should be an easy test of the system, right? It's Google AI writing a\nsimple script using the Google CLI to interact with the Google Cloud Platform.\nClosed ecosystem, high degree of confident, should have definite sources of\ntruth.\n\n> Can you write a bash script using the gcloud CLI to query the status of all\n> deployments using cloud deploy, a GCP service, in the GCP project test123\n> and output the name and current name to a markdown file for each one?\n    \n    \n    #!/bin/bash # Set project ID PROJECT_ID=\"test123\" # Output directory for markdown files OUTPUT_DIR=\"deployment_statuses\" # Create output directory if it doesn't exist mkdir -p \"$OUTPUT_DIR\" # Get all deployments deployments=$(gcloud deploy deployments list --project \"$PROJECT_ID\" --format=\"value(NAME)\") # Loop through each deployment for deployment in $deployments; do # Get deployment details deployment_details=$(gcloud deploy deployments describe \"$deployment\" --project \"$PROJECT_ID\" --format=\"yaml\") # Parse name and state from YAML output name=$(echo \"$deployment_details\" | yq .name) state=$(echo \"$deployment_details\" | yq .status.state) # Create markdown file for deployment output_file=\"$OUTPUT_DIR/$name.md\" echo \"# Deployment: $name\" > \"$output_file\" echo \"Current State: $state\" >> \"$output_file\" # Add additional information to markdown file as needed (e.g., rollout strategy, create time) # ... done echo \"Deployment statuses written to markdown files in $OUTPUT_DIR\"\n    \n    12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334\n\nLooks great right? Exactly what I wanted. Except it doesn't work.\n\ngcloud doesn't have a gcloud deploy deployments argument.\n\n    \n    \n    NAME gcloud deploy - create and manage Cloud Deploy resources SYNOPSIS gcloud deploy GROUP | COMMAND [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...] DESCRIPTION Create and manage Cloud Deploy resources. GCLOUD WIDE FLAGS These flags are available to all commands: --help. Run $ gcloud help for details.

Maybe because not that many\npeople use gcloud it doesn't have a big enough sample size to construct a real\nanswer. Let's ask a more basic question, but let's keep it on Google\ntechnology. Kubernetes has been documented to death, books written about it,\nmillions of articles and blog posts. Certainly that will work.\n\n> How do I, in hosted Kubernetes on GCP, write a deployment configuration yaml\n> which sets nodeAffinity using\n> preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution. The nodepool should be\n> nodes02 with a weight of one.\n\nWhat I'm trying to prompt it here is to give me back a configuration file not\nwith nodeSelector but with Node Affinity, the softer preference level for\nassigning pods to nodes. But there's a small trick in the question. I want a\ndeployment not a Pod spec. This is a distinction which requires a more nuanced\ncomprehension of the subject matter, the ability to not pull the most common\nexample but the more specific example. What we want is this:\n\n    \n    \n    apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx-deployment spec: selector: matchLabels: app: nginx replicas: 3 template: metadata: labels: app: nginx spec: affinity: nodeAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - weight: 1 preference: matchExpressions: - key: cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool operator: In values: - nodes02 containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:1.7.9 ports: - containerPort: 80\n    \n    1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829\n\nWhat I got back was this:\n\n    \n    \n    spec: nodeSelector: cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool: nodes02 affinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - weight: 1 matchExpressions: - key: cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool operator: In values: - nodes02\n    \n    1234567891011\n\nThe problem with this response is it does a very different thing from the\nthing I was trying to do. nodeSelector is a stricter approach, ensuring pods\nare only scheduled on nodes that match the label. nodeAffinity is a much\nsofter preference, telling k8s I'd like the pods to go there if possible but\nif that isn't possible, put them where you would normally do.\n\nBoth of these examples seem reasonable. The machine responded with something\nthat could be construed as the answer, a clever parody of human intelligence,\nbut ultimately it is more like a child playing. It doesn't understand the\nquestion, but understands how to construct convincing looking fakes.\n\nTo the faithful though, this isn't a problem.\n\n> However, if the training data is incomplete or biased, the AI model may\n> learn incorrect patterns. This can lead to the AI model making incorrect\n> predictions, or hallucinating.\n\n> For example, an AI model that is trained on a dataset of medical images may\n> learn to identify cancer cells. However, if the dataset does not include any\n> images of healthy tissue, the AI model may incorrectly predict that healthy\n> tissue is cancerous. This is an example of an AI hallucination.\n\n[Source]\n\nThis creates a false belief that the problem lies with the training data,\nwhich for both of my examples simply cannot be true. Google controls both ends\nof that equation and can very confidently \"ground\" the model with verifiable\nsources of information. In theory this should tether their output and reduce\nthe chances of inventing content. It reeks of a religious leader claiming\nwhile that prophecy was false, the next one will be real if you believe hard\nenough. It also moves the responsibility for the problem from the AI model to\n\"the training data\", which for these LLMs represents a black box of\ninformation. I don't know what the training data is, so I can't question\nwhether its good or bad.\n\n### Is There Anything Here?\n\nNow that isn't to say there isn't amazing work happening here. LLMs can do\nsome fascinating things and the transformer work has the promise to change how\nwe allow people to interact with computers. Instead of an HTML form with\nstrict validation and obtuse error messages, we can instead help explain to\npeople in real-time what is happening, how to fix problems, just in general\nprovide more flexibility when dealing with human inputs. We can have a machine\nlook at less-sorted data and find patterns, there are lots of ways for this\ntech to make meaningful differences in human life.\n\nIt just doesn't have a trillion dollars worth of value. This isn't a magic\nmachine that will replace all human workers, which for some modern executives\nis the same as being able to talk directly to God in terms of the Holy Grail\nof human progress. Finally all the money can flow directly to the CEO himself,\ncutting out all those annoying middle steps. The demand of investors for these\ncompanies to produce something new has outstripped their ability to do that,\nresulting in a dangerous technology being unleashed upon the world with no\nsafeties. We've made a lying machine that doesn't show you its work, making it\neven harder for people to tell truth from fiction.\n\nIf LLMs are going to turn into actual AI, we're still years and years from\nthat happening. This represents an interesting trick, a feel-good exercise\nthat, unless you look too closely, seems like you are actually talking to an\nimmortal all-knowing being that lives in the clouds. But just like everything\nelse, if your faith is shaken for even a moment the illusion collapses.\n\nQuestions/comments/concerns: https://c.im/@matdevdug\n\nShare\n\n## Why Can't My Mom Email Me?\n\nProton email keeps sending my non-Proton email accounts encrypted emails.
