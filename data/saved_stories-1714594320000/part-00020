Within computing fields, websites such as Stack\n> Overflow are considered important sources for users seeking solutions to\n> their computing and programming issues. However, like other social media\n> platforms, Stack Overflow contains a mixture of relevant and irrelevant\n> information. In this paper, we evaluated neural network models to predict\n> the quality of questions on Stack Overflow, as an example of Question\n> Answering (QA) communities. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of\n> neural network models compared to baseline machine learning models,\n> achieving an accuracy of 80%. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the\n> number of layers in the neural network model can significantly impact its\n> performance.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.14449 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.14449v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14449arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Mohammad Al-Ramahi [view email] [v1] Sat, 20 Apr 2024 16:48:18 UTC (254\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Predicting Question Quality on StackOverflow\nwith Neural Networks, by Mohammad Al-Ramahi and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
