Keep your phone on at all times\n\nYou never know when you\u2019ll want to scroll.\n\n2\\. Take your phone everywhere\n\nAnd you never know where you\u2019ll want to scroll.\n\n3\\. Use the same phone for personal and work\n\nMix the two so you always have a reason to be on your phone.\n\n4\\. Take your phone to bed with you\n\nYour phone is your best friend. You should sleep with your best friend.\n\n5\\. Use your phone for everything in your life\n\nBanking, maps, music, camera. Make sure you depend on your phone for\neverything you could possibly need. That way, scroll-unrelated things will\nhelp you back onto your phone to scroll more.\n\nFor example: use your phone for payments. You\u2019ll check your phone every time\nyou pay for something, leading to more scrolling. Excellent!\n\n6\\. Get as big and shiny a phone as possible\n\nSize matters. The bigger and shinier your phone, the more you\u2019ll want to\nscroll on it.\n\n7\\. Use your phone to deal with anxiety\n\nThat unsettling feeling that something is not quite right? Don\u2019t worry,\nthere\u2019s a quick fix: take out your phone and start scrolling!\n\nYou don\u2019t have any underlying issues to address \u2014 scrolling fixes everything.\n\n8\\. Scroll around your friends and family\n\nThey understand. They know you have scrolling to do, and that your phone is\nmore important than them. While you\u2019re scrolling, watch a few videos (maybe\neven on loud!) so your family can\u2019t distract you.\n\nPro tip: keep your phone in view at all times when around people, face up so\nyou can see notifications popping up. Speaking of:\n\n9\\. Leave on all notifications for all apps, all the time\n\nNotifications are an awesome reminder to do some more scrolling. Don\u2019t try to\nmanage them, just let them be. Notifications know best.\n\n10\\. Even when you\u2019re not scrolling, think about scrolling\n\nJust because you don\u2019t have your phone in your hand, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t\nstill think about it. Make sure your focus is always on the scrolling you\u2019ll\ndo once you\u2019re on your phone again.\n\n11\\. Get defensive at people saying you scroll too much\n\nWho are they to judge? They probably scroll just as much. Hypocrites! There\u2019s\nnot a single grain of truth in what they\u2019re saying \u2014 they are just trying to\nmake you feel bad for no reason.\n\n12\\. Use TikTok, Instagram or Snapchat\n\nTo be a proper scroller, you\u2019re going to need one of these apps installed.\nIdeally, all of them.\n\n13\\. Use video platforms, not text ones\n\nWho needs words when you can have short videos designed to keep you scrolling?\n\n14\\. Rely on social media for all your news\n\nDon\u2019t cheat by going direct to news sites, or even worse, subscribing to\nnewsletters. If you scroll enough, you\u2019ll eventually see all the news you\nneed.\n\n15\\. Do what the app wants you to\n\nThe app knows best. If it wants you to keep your streak, keep your streak. If\nit wants you to live stream, live stream. If it wants you to scroll, scroll.\n\n16\\. Get into phone gaming\n\nOK, it\u2019s not quite scrolling per se \u2014 but it\u2019s in the right ballpark. Phone\ngaming is your friend, and it\u2019ll help you to spend even more time on your\nphone scrolling.\n\n17\\. Make sure to post, don\u2019t just lurk\n\nPosting will keep you checking how your post did, which will mean scrolling\neven more. Bonus!\n\n18\\. Join as many messaging groups as you can\n\nMessaging is great for scrolling too. You\u2019ll want to make sure you join as\nmany groups as possible, and once in, never leave.\n\nRemember: if you leave, everyone will know, and they\u2019ll think you\u2019re a\nterrible person.\n\n19\\. Use messaging apps for work\n\nYou won\u2019t succeed at your job unless you talk to the people you work with on\nWhatsApp. When they message you outside of work hours, make sure you reply\nstraight away, otherwise you\u2019ll lose your job.\n\n20\\. Use social media for work\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about scrolling on social media, you need to make things\nofficial. Post a few times a day for work, and ramp up until you\u2019re a fully-\nfledged influencer.\n\n21\\. Don\u2019t meet people in real life\n\nUse your natural human urge to find a partner as fuel to spend more time\nscrolling. Tinder, Hinge, Grindr and other dating apps are great places to\nscroll.\n\nIf you like someone in real life, don\u2019t talk to them \u2014 check if there\u2019s\nsomeone better on the apps.\n\n22\\. Don\u2019t check your screen time\n\nAnd if you do, remember most of that time was stuff you had to do, and it\nwasn\u2019t a typical day/week, and something seems a little high about the number\nanyway, and most people you know use their phones way more.\n\n23\\. Don\u2019t ever think about how much you\u2019re scrolling\n\nYou\u2019re scrolling the right amount. Well, actually \u2014 a little more would be\ngood.\n\n24\\. Go scroll somewhere else, immediately!\n\nEmergency! The scrolling in this article is running out, fast! Please proceed\nto the nearest scroll! Do *not* pause to reflect!\n\nWell done for scrolling all the way down! I write other things that you can\nscroll on \u2014 leave your email so you don\u2019t miss out on a single\nscrollportunity:\n\n###\n\nHow good at scrolling are you?\n\nOne point for each of the above.\n\n20+ points: Life and scroll of the party\n\nCongratulations! You\u2019re on track to spend practically all of your life\nscrolling!\n\n10-19 points: Time for some scroll-searching\n\nNot great, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 your phone will soon help you up to 20+, no\nspecial effort required on your side.\n\n0-9 points: God save your scroll\n\nYou\u2019re useless! Stop looking at trees and the sunset and the people you love!\nGet back on your phone, now!\n\nThanks to\n\nDamola Morenikeji\n\nfor his brilliant ultimate antiguide to happiness, which inspired this.\nAnything you\u2019d add to the list?
