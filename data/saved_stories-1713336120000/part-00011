For that\nhackathon, we remixed the game to create a rocket ship \ud83d\ude80 Flappy-bird-like\ngame, and it immediately became a hit in our intern groupchat. It never\nshipped to production to hit the light of day, but that joy of remixing a game\nstuck with me: it\u2019s the dream of miniapps to create small experiences and then\nshare them with your friends.\n\nWhile Messenger wasn\u2019t about to open itself up to user created miniapps in my\nsummer of 2016, the conditions are finally right to usher in the next era of\nsocial. The confluence of AI (making it easier to code) and crypto (making new\nmonetization marketplace models possible) is breathing new life into a space\nthat hasn\u2019t seen a long-lasting social app since TikTok launched in September\n2016. I believe the shift will be exemplified in the next social primitive:\nthe miniapp.\n\n## Miniapps are the New Social Primitive\n\nEras of Social Primitives\n\nWe\u2019ve had the social app for each era of media; the eras being text, photos,\nthen video. The next era is the era of miniapps. We\u2019ve been able to share\ntext, photos, and then videos with our friends for a decade \u2014 next, we\u2019ll\nbuild into platforms to craft our own post types. User generated apps are\nalready winning in gaming (Roblox), now they\u2019re coming to social.\n\nWhat are miniapps and what do they do allow you to do?\n\nMiniapps make posts. Users play with miniapps to create new art, music, or\ngames, which then can be experienced by your friends. Miniapps live inside a\nsuper app, which acts as a constant contact book and platform for the feeds\nand groupchats that miniapps live inside of. Miniapps are creative tools that\nrender their end product to a feed.\n\nA miniapp fundamentally has two steps. They start with the singleplayer mode,\nwhere someone enters their data, plays the game, or interacts with the app.\nThe second mode is how it shows up in a feed, which is a typically the\nfinished product of the creative process: the finished song, GIF, or\nhighscore. Some quick examples:\n\n  * Artistic miniapps first allow artists to draw on a canvas, and then post their watercolor. Yes, Microsoft Paint is basically a miniapp.\n\n  * Commerce miniapps first allow a seller to decide what to sell and how to make the post look, and then allows users to buy with one tap.\n\n  * Game miniapps first allow friends to play the game, and then allows them to compete by posting their highscores.\n\n  * Utility miniapps take the most arcane 3D image filetypes, and then render them properly in the feed.\n\nMiniapps empower everyone to be Josh Wardle, the guy who created Wordle. He\nbuilt a word game for his partner, and managed to bring a daily spark of joy\ninto millions of people\u2019s lives by leveraging social feeds for the ubiquitous\npass/fail emoji blocks. For a moment in time, Wordle exemplified the promise\nof a fun, open internet. From that spark spawned a universe of remixes:\nWorldle, a game for guessing the outline of a country, Heardle, a game for\nguessing the music, and the list goes on. It was a whimsical time for\ndiscovering tiny, new games. Yet there was no central hub for these\nessentially miniapps. A social platform powered by miniapps has all the\nmemetic potential of inspiring the next Wordle creators.\n\n### Why Miniapps Win\n\nMiniapps move the agency of innovation to the end user, and therefore to\nindividual communities. When I worked at Facebook, we did research trips, like\nthe time I went to Indonesia in 2018 to study if TikTok was going to\nbreakthrough to the United States. We used these learnings to power our\nCreative Tools team \u2014 the ones responsible for building new ways to share\nphotos & videos, the most popular one being Boomerang. We were often just\nguessing at what users wanted out of their social sharing experiences, and\nvalidating our hunches with data gathered from releasing the feature to 1% of\nthe population.\n\nBut ultimately, if a photographer wants to show off their photos in a\nparticular way, why is a larger company the one to tell them how it\u2019s going to\nshow up in a little box? If a 3D artist wants to have their object spin in\nspace, they should have the ability to make it happen. Social platforms that\nembrace miniapps as their feed post primitive will outcompete traditional\nsocial platforms, because they will innovate so much faster by incorporating\ntalent from the community. Just like how crowdsourced YouTube videos have\nstarted to supplant Netflix watch time, so too will crowdsourced miniapps beat\nstatic post types on Instagram. Crowdsourced content always beats centralized\ncontent.\n\n> \u201cNo matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.\u201d\n> \u2014 Joy\u2019s Law\n\nThe medium is no longer the message. When we hang out with our friends online,\nit\u2019s the content of what we\u2019re talking about, not the medium, that matters. A\ngroup chat makes this easy: we drop voice notes next to photo memes next to\nvideos we took of the squad trip. Yet outside of heavily walled gardens like\niMessage apps, there\u2019s no way for individuals to build new experiences inside\nof these group chats. We download new apps to try new types of sharing with\nour friends, but the process of populating a new social graph is cumbersome.\n\nEmpowering individuals and communities to quickly build for their own usecases\nsparks more innovation than constraining ideation to company insiders.\n\nMiniapps are Memetic\n\nMiniapps are inherently viral. What Tiktok did for videos, miniapps will do to\nsocial feeds. When your friend creates a post using a miniapp, you\u2019ll be able\nto immediately do so as well for instant mimicry, spreading it to your own\ngroup of friends. In the Worldle example, you\u2019d be able to immediately go from\nthe score post directly into playing the game yourself. This turbocharges\ngrowth and discovery for new miniapps, making it a desirable place for miniapp\ndevelopers looking for distribution, and consumers looking for new\nexperiences.\n\nMiniapps will naturally explode in popularity and then fade quickly, but\nthat\u2019s okay and intentional: the building blocks for the next viral miniapp\nwill be open source and ready to be remixed. Like how brush fires in forests\nallow for new plant growth, miniapps will blaze into and out of popularity\nwith a constant set of friends underneath.\n\nThe miniapp marketplace has a two sided network effect: as the marketplace of\nminiapps grows, the super app solves more problems for users, making them more\nlikely to stay.\n\nMiniapps are fast to make\n\nSpeeding the innovation process along is that miniapps are faster to build\nthan entire social apps. Rather than becoming a full software engineer,\nbuilding a backend database, and figuring out authentication flows, miniapps\nfocus on the frontend of the experience (ie, sharing photos in a novel way).\nAll the lower levels of the stack, the database, authentication, user session\ntokens, are handled by the super app. Developers create these miniapps like\nsoftware Legos: piecing together components into fun new ways to connect. This\nmeans it\u2019s much easier to learn to code a miniapp. At Seam, we chose to use\nJavascript and React components, which already power most of the web, making\nit easy for anyone with the foundations of coding to contribute.\n\nMiniapps lower the barrier of entry required to create new software, and in\nturn, open it up to an entirely new demographic of creators. Just like the\nearly internet had folks experimenting changing the code on their MySpace\nprofiles, Geocities sites, and even their Neopets stores, miniapps are an\ninvitation to non-coders to learn how to manipulate software for the first\ntime. Even better, one person\u2019s work can be the springboard for someone else \u2014\nstanding on the shoulders of giants.\n\nCompounding this trend is that AI is making coding easier overall. Code can\nnow be generated from natural language, and if there is a corpus of existing\nminiapps, AI can even write the code in the required style and format.\nMiniapps will become the AI killer usecase: if software is eating the world,\nwe\u2019re making it possible for everyone to feast.\n\n### Miniapps: The Future Creative Renaissance\n\nSo, what are the first miniapps going to be? Like the advent of all newly\ndisruptive technology, the first era will be one of skeuomorphism: miniapps\nthat copy the features of existing social apps. At the beginning, most of\nthese miniapps will \u201cfeel like toys\u201d: I\u2019m imaging ephemeral photo miniapps,\nlike Snapchat, meme creation miniapps, like Mematic, or daily word games, like\nNYT Connections. After reading this article, you\u2019ll start seeing entire\nexisting social apps as miniapps waiting to be built.\n\nFurther down the line, people will iterate on and remix miniapps such that\nentirely new ways of creating, socializing, and sharing come to life.\nInevitably, as there was an Uber for the mobile era, a new app that harnessed\nthe full capability of the new technology to build a huge business, there will\nbe a miniapp that fully leverages the capabilities of living in a social feed.\n\nAt Seam, we\u2019re building the first community developed social network, powered\nby miniapps. We already have our miniapp builder live, and our crowdsourced\nlist of ideas for miniapps exists as a repository to record everyone\u2019s\ncreativity.\n\nThe future is bright with the Cambrian explosion of creativity on the horizon\nbecause Miniapps are ushering a new renaissance of online expression.
