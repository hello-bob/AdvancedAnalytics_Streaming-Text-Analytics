Instead,\nthe co-worker can start thinking about your question right away!\n\nYou're trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you\nwould do in person or on the phone. But Chat is neither of those things.\nTyping is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just\nmaking the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost\nproductivity.\n\nThe same goes for \"Hello -- Are you there?\", \"Hi Bob -- quick question.\", \"Do\nyou have a sec ?\", \"yt?\" and \"ping\". Just ask the question!\n\nIf you feel it's brusque to simply say \"Hi\" and ask the question, you can do\nsomething like this:\n\n    \n    \n    2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- if you're not busy I was wondering if I could ask a question. I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]\n\nAdditionally, asking your question before getting a reply allows asynchronous\ncommunication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come\nback, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a\n\"Hello\" and wondering what they missed.\n\nShort link to this page: http://nohello.com/. (If you see that as someone's\nstatus, please be prepared to be ignored if you only say \"Hello!\".)\n\nat\n\nJanuary 16, 2013\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nHome\n\nSubscribe to: Posts (Atom)\n\n### Please Don't Say Just Hello In Chat\n\nPlease Don't Say Just Hello In Chat 2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi 2010-07-19\n12:32:15 co-worker: Hello. ## CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU ...\n\n  * Please Don't Say Just Hello In Chat\n\nPlease Don't Say Just Hello In Chat 2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi 2010-07-19\n12:32:15 co-worker: Hello. ## CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU ...\n\n## Blog Archive\n\n  * \u25bc 2013 (1)\n\n    * \u25bc January (1)\n\n      * Please Don't Say Just Hello In Chat\n\n### Report Abuse\n\n  * Home\n\n|\n\n## Search This Blog  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nSimple theme.
