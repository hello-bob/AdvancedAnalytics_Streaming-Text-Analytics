Photograph: Justin Thomas\n\nThe ObserverSaving money\n\n# How rental \u2018libraries of things\u2019 have become the new way to save money\n\nFrom baby clothes to popcorn makers, borrowing items rather than buying them\nis a growing trend\n\nLaura Whateley\n\nMon 6 May 2024 10.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nA year into motherhood and I can confirm two things: babies grow too fast and\nclothing them is an expensive business.\n\nMy solution has been to rent my daughter Stella\u2019s wardrobe. Warm coats,\nswimming costumes, sleepsuits, sandals \u2013 all can be borrowed for a monthly\nsubscription from any number of services such as Bundlee, Lullaloop and\nthelittleloop, amongst others.\n\nThrough Or Collective, I pay \u00a336 a month for 10 items, which I can keep until\nStella outgrows them, the season shifts or I just fancy a change. The clothes\nturn up in the post and some are brand-new with tags.\n\nClothes rental for children is one of the latest chapters in how \u201clibraries of\nthings\u201d are becoming an increasingly common way to save money, space and\nwaste. The theory is simple: instead of buying a household item or a piece of\nclothing or some equipment you might use once or twice, you take it out and\nreturn it.\n\nThe London-based Library of Things opened three new locations across the city\nthis year and are planning two more. Co-founder Rebecca Trevalyan says their\nmission is to make \u201cborrowing better than buying\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe really want to make rental go mainstream, make it more affordable,\nconvenient and socially rewarding than buying something from Amazon,\u201d she\nsays.\n\nThere are many success stories of previous borrowers from her locations. One\nperson hired a metal detector to hunt down the wedding ring they lost when\ncamping in Sussex and found it within 20 minutes. Another rented a planer at\n\u00a311 a day to fix two doors in her flat after being quoted \u00a3245 for a handyman\nto come in and do the three hour job.\n\nIn Wales, Benthyg Cymru runs a network of more than two dozen libraries across\nthe country. And Edinburgh\u2019s Tool Library has thousands of options to choose\nfrom. In Bath, you can book in a cargo bike delivery and collection to pick up\nyour item from its Share and Repair shop.\n\n> \u2018We want rental to go mainstream ... to make it more affordable, convenient\n> and socially rewarding than buying from Amazon\u2019\n\nRebecca Trevalyan, Library of Things\n\nAll libraries have a selection of items that people may normally find too\nbulky, expensive or not useful enough to buy. Some are keen to try something\nto see if it\u2019s worth the investment. The number one most popular thing to\nborrow is a carpet cleaner, followed by a cordless drill and a hand sander,\naccording to Trevalyan.\n\nYou can borrow a projector and a popcorn machine for cinema nights, a speaker\nand PA system for parties. \u201cIn summer we see a lot more garden items being\nused: strimmers, hedge trimmers, lawn mowers, tents for adventuring, ice cream\nmakers and gazebos for barbecues,\u201d says Trevalyan.\n\nTypically, users browse the items online then choose a location and date to\ncollect them. Unlike a library of books, there are fees, charged daily. A\nhandheld pressure washer is \u00a312 a day, while garden shears are \u00a33.50 with the\nLibrary of Things. Each listing shows how bulky and heavy the item is to get\nhome.\n\n\u201cAn air fryer came in recently - there\u2019s been an air fryer craze, and we\nwanted to introduce it so that people could see if they really did want to buy\none,\u201d says Trevalyan.\n\nOne in 10 people now chooses to rent rather than buy brand-new, a rising\nnumber since 2022, according to figures from Barclaycard Payments and economic\nanalysts Development Economics.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best\nObserver writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

The trend is\npermeating a range of sectors, from childcare to pet care and from fashion to\nfitness.\u201d\n\nA number of new companies and off-shoots of existing brands have emerged\nhoping to capitalise on the trend. Wilko has just launched \u201cWilkohire\u201d, where\ncustomers can borrow tools, painting and decorating, gardening or landscaping\nequipment. Schuh works with Hirestreet, a popular clothes rental website, to\nrent out footwear.\n\nInterrupted Art offers paintings, drawings and photography on subscription.\nYou can order a new work, delivered and hung in your home before being swapped\nfor something else, every 10 weeks, for \u00a366 a month.\n\n\u2018Every penny has a purpose\u2019: the rise of zero-based budgeting\n\nRead more\n\nThere are clearly savings on offer, as long as you are happy not to own items\nor want to resell them when they are out of use.\n\nAccording to Or Collective\u2019s website, I have saved \u00a3640 over the past two\nmonths. Not that I would have ever spent that much - the clothes I borrow from\nbrands such as Bobo Choses and Tinycottons are much pricier than I\u2019d ever be\nable to justify, which is part of the service\u2019s appeal. My daughter is far\nbetter dressed than I am as a result. That said, you can buy them at a reduced\nprice if you become particularly attached.\n\nNow we need bigger toys so I\u2019ve signed up to Whirli, a subscription service to\na toy library, to borrow a walker and climbing frame. Meanwhile, companies\nsuch as Baboodle let you hire bulky equipment - for example, travel cots,\nbouncers, buggies and high chairs - so that after a few months of use, you\nwon\u2019t need to buy a semi-detached home with a garage to store it all.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Saving money\n  * The Observer\n  * Consumer affairs\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Money\n  * Property\n  * Pensions\n  * Savings\n  * Borrowing\n  * Careers\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
