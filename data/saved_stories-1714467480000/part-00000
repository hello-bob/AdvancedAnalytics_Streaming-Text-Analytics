Inside Wealth newsletter\nwith Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer.\nSign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nThe wealth gap between rich millennials and the rest of their age group is the\nlargest of any generation, creating a new wave of class tension and\nresentment, according to a recent study.\n\nEven as the vast majority of millennials struggle with student debt, low-wage\nservice-jobs, unaffordable housing and low savings, the millennial elite are\nsurpassing previous generations. According to the study, the average\nmillennial has 30% less wealth at the age of 35 than baby boomers did at the\nsame age. Yet the top 10% of millennials have 20% more wealth than the top\nbaby boomers at the same age.\n\n\u201cMillennials are so different from one another that it is not particularly\nmeaningful to talk about the \u2018average\u2019 Millennial experience,\u201d wrote the\nstudy\u2019s authors, Rob Gruijters, Zachary Van Winkle and Anette Eva Fasang.\n\u201cThere are some Millennials who are doing extremely well\u2014think Mark Zuckerberg\nand Sam Altman\u2014while others are struggling.\u201d\n\nThe study finds that millennials \u2014 typically defined as those between the age\nof 28 and 43 today \u2014 have faced repeated financial headwinds. Coming of age\nduring the financial crisis, they have lower levels of homeownership, larger\ndebts outweighing assets, low-wage and unstable jobs, and lower rates of dual-\nincome family formation.\n\nAt the same time, the authors say the top 10% of millennials have benefited\nfrom greater rewards for skilled jobs. As they put it, \u201cThe returns to high-\nstatus work trajectories have increased, while the returns to low-status\ntrajectories have stagnated or declined.\u201d\n\nThe millennials who \u201cwent to college, found graduate level jobs, and started\nfamilies relatively late,\u201d ended up with \u201chigher levels of wealth than Baby\nBoomers with similar life trajectories,\u201d according to the report.\n\n## The great wealth transfer\n\nThere may be another factor creating so much wealth among millennials:\ninheritances. In what\u2019s known as \u201cthe great wealth transfer,\u201d baby boomers are\nexpected to pass down between $70 trillion and $90 trillion in wealth over the\nnext 20 years. Much of that is expected to go to their millennial children.\nHigh-net-worth individuals worth $5 million or more will account for nearly\nhalf of that total, according to Cerulli Associates.\n\nWealth management firms say some of that wealth has already starting trickling\ndown to the next generation.\n\n\u201cThe great wealth transfer, which we\u2019ve all been talking about for the last 10\nyears, is underway,\u201d said John Mathews, head of UBS\u2019 Private Wealth Management\ndivision. \u201cThe average age of the world\u2019s billionaires is almost 69 right now.\nSo this whole transition or wealth handover will start to accelerate.\u201d\n\nTensions between millennial classes are likely to escalate as more wealth is\ntransferred in the coming years. Wealth displays on social media by millennial\n\u201cnepo babies\u201d could add to the intra-generational class war and drive\nnonwealthy millennials to overspend or create the appearance of lavish\nlifestyles to keep up.\n\nA survey by Wells Fargo found that 29% of affluent millennials (defined as\nhaving assets of $250,000 to over $1 million of investible assets) admit they\n\u201csometimes buy items they cannot afford to impress others.\u201d According to the\nsurvey, 41% of affluent millennials admit to funding their lifestyles with\ncredit cards or loans, versus 28% of Gen Xers and 6% of baby boomers.\n\nThe battle between rich millennials and the rest could also shape their\nattitudes toward wealth. For over four decades, the vast majority of\nmillionaires and billionaires created in America have been self-made, mostly\nentrepreneurs. A study by Fidelity Investments found that 88% of American\nmillionaires are self-made.\n\nYet inherited wealth could become more common. A study by UBS found that among\nnewly minted billionaires last year, heirs who inherited their fortunes racked\nup more wealth than self-made billionaires for the first time in at least nine\nyears. And, all the billionaires under the age of 30 on the latest Forbes\nbillionaires list inherited their wealth, for the first time in 15 years.\n\n## \u2018Extreme\u2019 wealth\n\nThe surge in wealth among millennial heirs is also creating a lucrative new\nmarket for wealth-management firms, luxury companies, travel firms and real\nestate brokers.\n\nClayton Orrigo, one of the top luxury real estate brokers in Manhattan, has\nbuilt a thriving business on moneyed millennials. The founder of the Hudson\nAdvisory Team at Compass has sold over $4 billion in real estate and regularly\nbrokers deals over $10 million. He says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of his business\nlately is from buyers in their 20s and 30s with inherited wealth.\n\n\u201cI just sold a $16 million apartment to someone in their mid-20s, and the\nbuyer accessed the family trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wealth that is behind these\nkids is extreme.\u201d\n\nInherited wealth has become Orrigo\u2019s specialty. He says he works on forging\nclose relationships with family offices, trusts and young money elite mingling\nat New York membership clubs like Casa Cipriani.\n\nThe pattern is familiar: A wealthy family calls wanting a rental for their son\nor daughter; a few years later, they want a $5 million or $10 million two-\nbedroom condo to buy in a new, high-security building downtown.\n\n\u201cMy gig is working very quietly and very discreetly with the wealthiest\nfamilies in the world,\u201d Orrigo said.\n\nSign up to receive future editions of CNBC\u2019s Inside Wealth newsletter with\nRobert Frank.\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
