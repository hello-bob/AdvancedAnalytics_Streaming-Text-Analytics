Credit: Chalmers University of Technology | Anna Lunde Hermansson\n\nDischarge from ships with so-called scrubbers cause great damage to the Baltic\nSea. A new study from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shows that\nthese emissions caused pollution corresponding to socioeconomic costs of more\nthan \u20ac680 million (approximately $730 million) between 2014 and 2022.\n\nAt the same time, the researchers note that the shipping companies'\ninvestments in the much-discussed technology, where exhaust gases are \"washed\"\nand discharged into the sea, have already been recouped for most of the ships.\nThis means that the industry is now making billions of euros by running its\nships on cheap heavy fuel oil instead of cleaner fuel.\n\n\"We see a clear conflict of interest, where private economic interests come at\nthe expense of the marine environment in one of the world's most sensitive\nseas,\" says Chalmers doctoral student Anna Lunde Hermansson, who is one of the\nauthors of the new study, published in Nature Sustainability.\n\nThe study has been prompted by the ongoing discussion of a potential ban on\nscrubber water discharge\u2014where large volumes of polluted water are produced\nand discharged from the ships' exhaust gas cleaning systems. The issue is on\nthe agenda at multiple levels within the International Maritime Organization\n(IMO) and is also being discussed at EU level as well as on national levels\nsuch as the Swedish Parliament, although a Swedish decision on a ban is yet to\nbe made.\n\nAnna Lunde Hermansson and Chalmers colleagues Erik Ytreberg and Ida-Maja\nHassell\u00f6v have been researching the environmental impact of shipping for many\nyears and are contributing with their expertise in both international and\nnational contexts.\n\nIn a previous study, for example, they have shown that more than 200 million\ncubic meters of environmentally hazardous scrubber water is discharged into\nthe Baltic Sea annually and that scrubber discharge water accounts for up to\n9% of the total emissions of certain carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) into the Baltic Sea.\n\n## Excluding oil spill costs\n\nIn the new study, published in Nature Sustainability, the Chalmers researchers\ncalculated both the external costs of scrubber water discharge, and the\nfinancial balance sheets of over 3,800 vessels that invested in the scrubber\ntechnology. As for the costs associated with the degradation of marine\necosystems, the study shows that between the years 2014 and 2022, scrubber\nwater discharges have polluted at a cost of over \u20ac680 million in the Baltic\nSea area.\n\nThe calculations are based on models for willingness to pay to avoid marine\nenvironmental degradation, but according to the researchers, the estimates\nshould be regarded as an underestimate. For example, direct costs associated\nwith heavy fuel oil spills from ships using scrubbers are not included. The\nmulti-million euro sum that it costs to clean up oil after ships have grounded\nand leak oil, for example Marco Polo on the Swedish coast of Blekinge last\nautumn, are not included in the calculations.\n\n\"If the scrubbers had not existed, no ships today would have been allowed to\nrun on this dirty residual fuel. That is why the scrubber issue is highly\nrelevant to push the shipping industry towards less negative environmental\nimpact,\" says Lunde Hermansson.\n\nAnna Lunde Hermansson, Doctoral student, Department of Mechanics and Maritime Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. Credit: Chalmers University of Technology | Amanda Nylund\n\nRestrictions in several countries\n\nIn terms of the shipowner perspective, the researchers calculated the costs of\ninstalling and maintaining the scrubber systems, as well as the monetary gain\nfrom running the scrubber-equipped vessels on the cheaper and dirtier heavy\nfuel oil instead of the more expensive low-sulfur fuel alternatives.\n\nAccording to the calculations, the majority of the shipping companies that\ninvested in scrubbers have already reached break even, and the total surplus\nby the end of 2022 for all of the 3,800 vessels, was \u20ac4.7 billion. The\nresearchers also note that more than 95% of the most common scrubber system\n(so-called open loop) are repaid within five years.\n\n\"From the industry's point of view, it is often stressed that shipping\ncompanies have acted in good faith by investing in technology that would solve\nthe problem of sulfur content in air emissions and that they should not be\npenalized. Our calculations show that most investments have already been\nrecouped and that this is no longer a valid argument,\" says Lunde Hermansson.\n\nRecently, Denmark has decided to ban the discharge of scrubber water into so-\ncalled territorial waters, within 12 nautical miles of the coast. A number of\ncountries around the world, such as Germany, France, Portugal, Turkey and\nChina, have also adopted national bans or restrictions.\n\nIn Sweden, there is currently no general ban, although some ports, such as the\nPort of Gothenburg, have banned the discharge of scrubber water in their area.\n\n\"We now hope that the issue will also be given priority in the Swedish\nParliament. This is a low-hanging fruit where we can reduce our negative\nimpact on the vital marine environment,\" says Hermansson.\n\nIn addition to Hermansson, the study was conducted by Ida-Maja Hassell\u00f6v, Tiia\nGr\u00f6nholm, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Erik Fridell, Rasmus Parsmo, Jesper Hassell\u00f6v\nand Erik Ytreberg. The researchers are active at Chalmers University of\nTechnology, the Finnish Meteorological Institute and IVL, the Swedish\nEnvironmental Research Institute.\n\nMore information: Strong economic incentives of ship scrubbers promoting\npollution, Nature Sustainability (2024).
