Therefore,\nwe now introduce DAITA.\n\nThrough constant packet sizes, random background traffic and data pattern\ndistortion we are taking the first step in our battle against sophisticated\ntraffic analysis.\n\nWhen you connect to the internet through a VPN (or the Tor Network) your IP\naddress is masked, and your traffic is encrypted and hidden from your internet\nservice provider. If you also use a privacy-focused web browser, you make it\nharder for adversaries to monitor your activity through other tracking\ntechnologies such as third-party cookies, pixels or browser fingerprints.\n\nBut still, the mass surveillance of today is more sophisticated than ever, and\na growing threat against privacy is the analysis of patterns in encrypted\ncommunication through advanced traffic analysis.\n\n## This is how AI can be used to analyze your traffic \u2013 even if it\u2019s\nencrypted.\n\nWhen you visit a website, there is an exchange of packets: your device will\nsend network packets to the site you're visiting and the site will send\npackets back to you. This is a part of the very backbone of the internet. The\nfact that packets are being sent, the size of the packets, and how often they\nare sent will still be visible for your ISP, even if you are using a VPN (or\nthe Tor network).\n\nSince every website generates a pattern of network packets being sent back and\nforth based on the composition of its elements (like images and text blocks),\nit\u2019s possible to use AI to connect traffic patterns to specific websites. This\nmeans your ISP or any observer (authority or data broker) having access to\nyour ISP can monitor all the data packets going in and out of your device and\nmake this kind of analysis to attempt to track the sites you visit, but also\nwho you communicate with using correlation attacks (you sending messages with\ncertain patterns at certain times, to another device receiving messages with a\ncertain pattern at same times).\n\n## How we combat traffic analysis: this is how DAITA works.\n\nDAITA has been developed together with Computer Science at Karlstad University\nand uses three types of cover traffic to resist traffic analysis.\n\n### 1\\. Constant Packet Sizes\n\nThe size of network packets can be particularly revealing, especially small\npackets, so DAITA makes all packets sent over the VPN the same constant size.\n\n### 2\\. Random Background Traffic\n\nBy unpredictably interspersing dummy packets into the traffic, DAITA masks the\nroutine signals to and from your device. This makes it harder for observers to\ndistinguish between meaningful activity and background noise.\n\n### 3\\. Data Pattern Distortion\n\nWhen visiting websites (or doing any other activity that causes significant\ntraffic), DAITA modifies the traffic pattern by unpredictably sending cover\ntraffic in both directions between client and VPN server. This distorts the\nrecognizable pattern of a website visit, resisting accurate identification of\nthe site.\n\n## The future of data brokers selling traffic data is already here\n\nWith the sophisticated AI of today, traffic analysis can potentially be used\nfor mass surveillance. The extent to which traffic analysis is used today is\ndifficult to ascertain. But the ambition is there. In 2021, Vice reported that\nthe FBI purchased netflow data from a data broker claiming to cover over 90\npercent of the world\u2019s internet traffic.\n\nHow traffic analysis can be used in the future is hard to overview. That\u2019s why\nwe need to work on a resistance today. This initial version of DAITA is our\nfirst response to the evolving challenges of online privacy. DAITA is released\nas open source and as we gather feedback we will continue to refine and\ndevelop, ensuring it remains at the forefront of privacy technology.\n\n\u201cWe don't need to speculate on the extent to which traffic analysis is being\nused today. We just observe the development of AI and the development of\nauthoritarian societies. There is also no need to speculate on which role\ntraffic analysis will play in future mass surveillance. What we must do is to\nrecognize the threats and opportunities \u2013 and work on resistance\u201d, says Jan\nJonsson, CEO at Mullvad VPN.\n\n## The building blocks of DAITA are open source\n\nDAITA is built using the open-source Maybenot defense framework, which Mullvad\nhelps to fund development of. The work has been academically peer reviewed and\npublished as open access.\n\n\u201cPutting traffic analysis defenses to practice is long overdue. Because the\narea is changing due to the rapid development of AI, investing time and energy\ninto a framework makes perfect sense\u201d, says Tobias Pulls, researcher at\nKarlstad University.\n\nTo begin with, DAITA 2024.3-beta1 is available in our VPN app on Windows 10\nand 11.\n\nTo start using DAITA: Download the beta version of Mullvad VPN for Windows. Go\nto Settings \u2013 VPN settings \u2013 WireGuard settings \u2013 turn on DAITA.\n\n## Mullvad\n\n## Policies\n\n## Address\n\nMullvad VPN AB\n\nBox 53049\n\n400 14 Gothenburg\n\nSweden\n\nsupport@mullvadvpn.net\n\n  * GPG key\n  * Onion service\n\n## Follow us\n\n## Language\n\n  * \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0651\u0629\n  * Dansk\n  * Deutsch\n  * English\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\n  * Suomi\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * Italiano\n  * \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n  * \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n  * Nederlands\n  * Norsk\n  * Polski\n  * Portugu\u00eas\n  * \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n  * Svenska\n  * \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\n  * T\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n  * \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\n  * \u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\n\n", "frontpage": false}
