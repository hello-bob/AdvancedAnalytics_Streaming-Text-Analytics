In this case, \"some people\"\nare a vague and undefined authority.\n\nIn rhetoric, a weasel word, or anonymous authority, is a word and/or phrase\naimed at creating an impression that something specific and meaningful has\nbeen said, when in fact only a vague, ambiguous, or irrelevant claim has been\ncommunicated. The terms may be considered informal. Examples include the\nphrases \"some people say\", \"it is thought\", and \"researchers believe\". Using\nweasel words may allow one to later deny any specific meaning if the statement\nis challenged, because the statement was never specific in the first place.\nWeasel words can be a form of tergiversation and may be used in advertising,\npopular science, opinion pieces and political statements to mislead or\ndisguise a biased view or unsubstantiated claim.\n\nWeasel words can harshen or over-state a controversial statement. An example\nof this is using terms like \"somewhat\" or \"in most respects,\" which make a\nsentence more ambiguous than it would be without them.^[1]\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\nThe expression weasel word may have derived from the egg-eating habits of\nweasels.^[2] An article published by the Buffalo News attributes the origin of\nthe term to William Shakespeare's plays Henry V and As You Like It, in which\nthe author includes similes of weasels sucking eggs.^[3] The article said that\nthis simile was flawed because weasels do not have the jaw musculature\nsuitable for sucking eggs.^[4]\n\nOvid's Metamorphoses provides an earlier source for the same etymology. Ovid\ndescribes how Juno orders the goddess of childbirth, Lucina, to prevent\nAlcmene from giving birth to Hercules. Alcmene's servant Galanthis, realizing\nthat Lucina is outside the room using magic to prevent the birth, emerges to\nannounce that the birth has been a success. Lucina, in her amazement, drops\nthe spells of binding and Hercules is born. Galanthis then mocks Lucina, who\nresponds by transforming her into a weasel. Ovid writes (in A.S. Kline's\ntranslation) \"And because her lying mouth helped in childbirth, she [as a\nweasel] gives birth through her mouth.\"^[5] Ancient Greeks believed that\nweasels conceived through their ears and gave birth through their mouths.^[6]\n\nDefinitions of the word 'weasel' that imply deception and irresponsibility\ninclude: the noun form, referring to a sneaky, untrustworthy, or insincere\nperson; the verb form, meaning to manipulate shiftily;^[7] and the phrase \"to\nweasel out,\" meaning \"to squeeze one's way out of something\" or \"to evade\nresponsibility.\"^[8]\n\nTheodore Roosevelt attributed the term to his friend William Sewall's older\nbrother, Dave, claiming that he had used the term in a private conversation in\n1879.^[9] The expression first appeared in print in Stewart Chaplin's short\nstory \"Stained Glass Political Platform\" (published in 1900 in The Century\nMagazine),^[10] in which weasel words were described as \"words that suck the\nlife out of the words next to them, just as a weasel sucks the egg and leaves\nthe shell.\" Roosevelt apparently later put the term into public use after\nusing it in a speech in St. Louis May 31, 1916. According to Mario Pei,\nRoosevelt said, \"When a weasel sucks an egg, the meat is sucked out of the\negg; and if you use a weasel word after another, there is nothing left of the\nother.\"^[11]\n\n## Forms[edit]\n\nA 2009 study of Wikipedia found that most weasel words in it could be divided\ninto three main categories:^[12]\n\n  1. Numerically vague expressions (for example, \"some people\", \"experts\", \"many\", \"evidence suggests\")\n  2. Use of the passive voice to avoid specifying an authority (for example, \"it is said\")\n  3. Adverbs that weaken (for example, \"often\", \"probably\")\n\nOther forms of weasel words may include these:^[13]^[14]\n\n  * Illogical or irrelevant statements\n  * Use of vague or ambiguous euphemisms^[15]\n  * Use of grammatical devices such as qualifiers, negation and the subjunctive mood\n  * In most languages with one, use of the first person plural pronoun\n  * Glittering or vague generalizations\n\nGeneralizing by means of quantifiers, such as many, when quantifiable measures\ncould be provided, obfuscates the point being made, and if done deliberately\nis an example of \"weaseling.\"\n\nIllogical or irrelevant statements are often used in advertising, where the\nstatement describes a beneficial feature of a product or service being\nadvertised. An example is the endorsement of products by celebrities,\nregardless of whether they have any expertise relating to the product. In non-\nsequitur fashion, it does not follow that the endorsement provides any\nguarantee of quality or suitability.\n\nFalse authority is defined as the use of the passive voice without specifying\nan actor or agent. For example, saying \"it has been decided\" without stating\nby whom, and citation of unidentified \"authorities\" or \"experts,\" provide\nfurther scope for weaseling. It can be used in combination with the reverse\napproach of discrediting a contrary viewpoint by glossing it as \"claimed\" or\n\"alleged.\" This embraces what is termed a \"semantic cop-out,\" represented by\nthe term allegedly.^[16] This implies an absence of ownership of opinion,\nwhich casts a limited doubt on the opinion being articulated. The construction\n\"mistakes were made\" enables the speaker to acknowledge error without\nidentifying those responsible.\n\nHowever, the passive voice is legitimately used when the identity of the actor\nor agent is irrelevant. For example, in the sentence \"one hundred votes are\nrequired to pass the bill,\" there is no ambiguity, and the actors including\nthe members of the voting community cannot practicably be named even if it\nwere useful to do so.^[17]^[18]\n\nThe scientific journal article is another example of the legitimate use of the\npassive voice. For an experimental result to be useful, anyone who runs the\nexperiment should get the same result. That is, the identity of the\nexperimenter should be of low importance. Use of the passive voice focuses\nattention upon the actions, and not upon the actor\u2014the author of the article.\nTo achieve conciseness and clarity, however, most scientific journals\nencourage authors to use the active voice where appropriate, identifying\nthemselves as \"we\" or even \"I.\"^[19]\n\nThe middle voice can be used to create a misleading impression. For example:\n\n  * \"It stands to reason that most people will be better off after the changes.\"\n  * \"There are great fears that most people will be worse off after the changes.\"\n  * \"Experience insists that most people will not be better off after the changes.\"\n\nThe first of these also demonstrates false authority, in that anyone who\ndisagrees incurs the suspicion of being unreasonable merely by dissenting.\nAnother example from international politics is use of the phrase \"the\ninternational community\" to imply a false unanimity.\n\nEuphemism may be used to soften and potentially mislead the audience. For\nexample, the dismissal of employees may be referred to as \"rightsizing,\"\n\"headcount reduction,\" and \"downsizing.\"^[20] Jargon of this kind is used to\ndescribe things euphemistically.^[21]\n\nRestricting information available to the audience is a technique sometimes\nused in advertisements. For example, stating that a product \"... is now 20%\ncheaper!\" raises the question, \"Cheaper than what?\" It might be said that\n\"Four out of five people prefer ...\" something, but this raises the questions\nof the size and selection of the sample, and the size of the majority. \"Four\nout of five\" could actually mean that there had been 8% for, 2% against, and\n90% indifferent.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Ambivalence\n  * Concept creep\n  * Corporate jargon\n  * Essentially contested concept\n  * Filler (linguistics)\n  * Fnord\n  * If-by-whiskey\n  * Linguistic relativity\n  * Newspeak\n  * Non-apology apology\n  * Non-denial denial\n  * Political correctness\n  * Spin (propaganda)\n  * Wooden language\n  * Hedge (linguistics)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jason, Gary (1988) \"Hedging as a Fallacy of Language\" Archived 23 June 2018 at the Wayback Machine, Informal Logic X.3, Fall 1988\n  2. ^ Theodore Roosevelt Association, Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia(subscription required) Archived 14 April 2012 at the Wayback Machine\n  3. ^ E.
