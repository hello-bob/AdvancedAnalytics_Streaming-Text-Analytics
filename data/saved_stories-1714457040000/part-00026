Git repositories with both SHA-1 and\nSHA-256 hash algorithm use can finally co-exist. Git has long been working on\nsupporting the more secure SHA256 hashes rather than SHA1.\n\nThe other big aspect of Git 2.45 is having initial reftable support. Reftable\nis a new reference storage back-end for Git. Git's Reftable aims for faster\nperformance with an entirely new format for storing Git references. With Git\n2.45 new repositories can be initialized with the \"--ref-format=reftable\"\nargument for making use of it.\n\nThe lengthy list of changes and fixes to find overall with Git 2.45 can be\nfound via the mailing list announcement. There's also a post on the GitHub\nBlog that covers the key v2.45 highlights in more detail.\n\n1 Comment\n\nRelated News\n\nRust-Based Coreutils 0.0.26 Increases Compatibility With GNU Coreutils\n\nServo Web Engine Now Passing Acid2 Layout Engine Test\n\nSovereign Tech Fund Makes New Investments Into GNOME & PHP, Bug Bounty For\nsystemd\n\nLlamafile 0.8 Releases With LLaMA3 & Grok Support, Faster F16 Performance\n\nNginx 1.26 Released With Experimental HTTP/3 Support\n\nTow-Boot 2023.07 U-Boot Distribution Released With New Board Support\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
