We\u2019re at forty! (Announcing the release of Fedora Linux 40)\n\n### Slimbook Fedora 2: New Ultrabooks for Fedora Linux 40\n\nFedora Linux is a community developed and maintained operating system. Fedora\nKDE is one of our adaptations of Fedora Linux for your laptop or desktop. With\nthis milestone release of Fedora KDE 40, we hope that you\u2019ll be interested in\ntrying an OS that belongs to you from start to finish, from install to first\nshut down, from UI customizations to major changes under the hood!\n\n## KDE Plasma 6\n\nThe all-encompassing change in Fedora KDE 40 is the introduction of KDE Plasma\n6. It\u2019s the first major release of the Plasma desktop environment in nine\nyears! Additionally, Fedora KDE is one of the first major distros to ship\nPlasma 6, and we\u2019re the first Fedora Linux desktop variant to ship Wayland-\nonly (not to worry, we retain full support for X11 applications!), enabling\nthe project to push forward improvements to Wayland for the benefit of the\nentire Linux community. This builds upon the work done in previous Fedora\nLinux releases to have Fedora KDE run in Wayland from login to shutdown by\ndefault.\n\n### Featured Highlights\n\n  * There\u2019s a new Overview Effect for keeping tabs on all of your open applications across all your virtual desktops.\n  * Partial support for HDR is implemented in this release on the way to having full support.\n  * Accessibility improvements have been introduced with color blindness correction filters.\n  * A new look to the taskbar comes in the form of a floating panel! Plasma 6 also makes customizing panels easier than ever with an understandable UI to help users make the changes they want with minimal effort.\n  * The Breeze UI theme that has been a hallmark of Plasma for a while gets a refresh with simplifications and modernizations where needed.\n  * NeoChat, KDE\u2019s Matrix client, is provided by default for you to try.\n  * The Cube has returned! The new Overview Effect is cool, but using the Cube to manage your virtual desktops is a fantastic party trick to impress your friends next time you\u2019re sharing your screen.\n\nYou can find more changes and improvements in KDE Plasma 6 from their\nmegarelease page!\n\n### A word about Kinoite...\n\nIf you have an interest in what all of the immutable / atomic / cloud-native /\ncomposable / image-based fuss is about, Fedora Atomic Desktops is a great\nentry point into that world. Case in point, check out Fedora Kinoite 40, an\natomic implementation of Fedora KDE that also comes with Plasma 6!\n\n## Also check out...\n\nAll of the fun events Fedora has coming up!\n\n  * Be on the lookout for dates for the Fedora 40 Release Party, a virtual, user-focused, two day conference all about the new things in Fedora and the exciting things happening from our contributors. Will (hopefully) happen in May.\n  * DevConf.CZ on June 13-15.\n  * Flock to Fedora, our in-person, contributor-focused conference, will be happening on August 7-10.\n  * DevConf.US follows right after on August 14-16.\n  * KDE\u2019s contributor conference, Akademy, will come to Germany on September 7-12.\n\nThanks for learning about Fedora KDE 40. We hope that it will continue to be\nthe reliable and exciting desktop OS you know and love.

(sudo dnf install kwin-x11\nplasma-workspace-x11)\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nReply\n\n  2. #### David Legg\n\nI can\u2019t seem to attract any attention for this Fedora 40 bug:\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265662 It affects nouveau use\nwith 2 monitors. I need somebody to update the bug record to point to Fedora\n40 for me, please.\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nReply\n\n     * #### Gregory Bartholomew\n\nI think you should be able to update the Fedora Linux release. You need to be\nsigned in and you probably need to click the \u201cShow advanced fields\u201d button\nfirst. That said, you might have better luck finding someone to help you\ntroubleshoot the problem at https://ask.fedporaproject.org/.\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nReply\n\n  3. #### Yinchuan\n\nWe should notify the KDE community to add Fedora 40 to the top of this list:\nhttps://community.kde.org/Distributions\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nReply\n\n  4. #### David Levner\n\nI currently use barrier to share a mouse and keyboard between computers. Last\ntime I checked, barrier couldn\u2019t run under Wayland so I have stuck with X11.\nCan you explain, perhaps in another article, how X11-only applications such as\nbarrier will be supported under the KDE spin of Fedora 40?\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nReply\n\n     * #### Landon J\n\nBarrier is unmaintained (+2yrs). They had a wayland bounty, but that seems to\nhave fallen through. I suggest switching to Input Leap, but also waiting on\nhttps://invent.kde.org/plasma/xdg-desktop-portal-kde/-/issues/12 to be\nresolved. (Should hit in Plasma 6.1)\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nReply\n\n  5. #### Darvond\n\nIndeed, all in all a good release. I hope that when Plasma 6 levels off a bit,\nthat they\u2019ll send people over to the Oxygen Squared project.\nhttps://invent.kde.org/pinheiro/oxygen2\n\nAlso eagerly awaiting Fedora to mainline LXQT 2.\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nReply\n\n  6. #### Ricardo\n\nCongrats! I\u2019m setting aside some time this weekend to upgrade my main machine.\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nReply\n\n  7. #### TomsT\n\nIs DNF really the only way to upgrade KDE Spin? I don\u2019t see any notifications\nabout new release in Discover. I think it can be a deal-breaker for people who\nare not really advanced or just don\u2019t follow new releases.\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nReply\n\n  8. #### Murat\n\nHello thanks for fedora 40. But not working my fingerprint. Lenovo thinkpad\ne580.\n\nUSB 06cb:00a2 \u00bb / ff-00-00 Synaptics, Inc.
