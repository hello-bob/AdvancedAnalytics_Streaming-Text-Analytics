The good news is that nations meeting in Ottawa have given\nthemselves until the end of this year to produce a legally binding agreement.\nThe bad news is that countries are further apart than they were last year. A\n31-page draft of the text has ballooned to nearly 100 pages, which contain a\nwide spectrum of positions. Countries have not even decided on how to reach a\nfinal agreement on the draft text. At this stage, the talks could completely\nfall apart, or the end result might be too weak or too narrow to be\nmeaningful.\n\nThe negotiations are being organized by the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP). As is customary, scientists are meant to be able to observe\nthe talks and also advise those attending the discussions. But researchers\nhave told Nature that they are often not in the negotiation room. Worryingly,\nfossil-fuel-producing countries and industries are lobbying to narrow the\ntreaty\u2019s focus on rules and targets for recycling plastics. Such targets are\nimportant, but a lot more is needed to end plastics pollution. All parties\nneed to get a handle on the colossal scale of the problem, and they must\nhonour their promise to place science at the heart of the talks.\n\nWe must protect the global plastics treaty from corporate interference\n\nPlastics are used extensively because of their highly useful properties \u2014 they\ncan be moulded into many shapes and are lightweight, hygienic, cheap to make\nand good insulators. For these reasons, plastics production is increasing\nsharply. In the past two decades it has doubled to more than 450 million\ntonnes annually. But we now know that, because of their huge downsides, their\nuse needs to be limited.\n\nAround 25% of all plastics manufactured end up polluting the environment. Of\nthis, 6 million tonnes end up in rivers and along coastlines annually. These\nmaterials degrade into micro- and nanosized particles that have been found\nalmost everywhere, from Arctic ice to Antarctic snow \u2014 and even in the\nstomachs of unborn babies. The greenhouse-gas emissions associated with\nplastics amount to almost 1.8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide \u2014 3% of the\nglobal total in 2019. Many of the chemicals, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl\nsubstances (PFAS), that are used to make and treat plastics are persisting in\nthe environment and are proving toxic to it.\n\nAlternatives must be found and serious steps need to be taken to tackle waste.\nIf there are no suitable alternatives, nations must invest in the\ninfrastructure necessary to recycle the materials and ensure that\nmanufacturers take responsibility for the full life cycle of their products.\nAnd they must ensure an equitable and just transition that protects people\nwhose jobs depend on the industry.\n\nBut we\u2019re not seeing countries take such steps in the lead-up to the\nnegotiations in Ottawa. Instead, discussions have been dominated by persistent\nlobbying by chemical-industry associations and by some fossil-fuel-producing\nnations, notably Iran, Russia and Saudi Arabia. They want to focus, for\ninstance, on recycling and on pollution-limiting rules, rather than on\neliminating plastics altogether, partly to allow production to continue on\ncurrent scales.\n\nMoreover, researchers are being sidelined when there is so much they could\nhelp to resolve. They include, for example, members of an international\nnetwork, the Scientists\u2019 Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, who\nprovide scientific advice to low-income countries that might not have their\nown research expertise.\n\nMuch is known about the toxicity, biology and chemistry of plastics pollution,\nand the economics of the industry. But there are gaps, especially around how\nvarious aspects of the plastic production and disposal streams affect people\nand their livelihoods. For example, how would a ban on plastics affect waste\ncollectors, who rely on discarded products to earn a living? Research is\nneeded to resolve these issues and to make the treaty work.\n\nPlastic waste is everywhere and countries must be held accountable for\nreducing it\n\nThe world\u2019s environment ministers proposed strengthening research-based policy\nadvice on plastic pollution. An anticipated mechanism called a Science\u2013Policy\nInterface for Plastic Pollution has not been established yet, although\nnegotiations for setting it up are continuing. Furthermore, scientists have\nbeen unable to observe the talks, which they should be allowed to do under UN\nrules. But researchers need to be able to participate meaningfully in the\ndebate.\n\nMany scientists were unable to get accreditation for the first three\nnegotiation rounds. This is because publicly funded universities had been\nincluded in the \u2018government\u2019 category, which meant that their researchers\nwould have had to be accredited as representing their governments, which they\ndon\u2019t. In January, UNEP clarified that those at public universities that are\nautonomous from their governments can apply. But it is not yet clear whether\nthis change has made it easier for academic researchers to get accreditation.\n\nSuccessfully navigating treaty talks requires finding common ground despite\nnations\u2019 competing priorities. One of the strengths of the present system of\norganizing talks is that all those involved agree that discussions will be\nguided by independent scientific knowledge. This is a foundational principle.\nMoreover, science has brought nations together to agree on a treaty \u2014 its role\ncannot be diminished now.\n\nFinding solutions to the plastic problem has to be a multisectoral,\nmultinational and genuinely collegial effort. No amount of recycling is going\nto stop the deluge of plastic coming into the economy. Negotiators need to\naccept that the only way that better waste management and recycling will work\nis if less plastic is made in the first place.\n\nNature 628, 474 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01089-2\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * We must protect the global plastics treaty from corporate interference\n\n  * Plastic waste is everywhere and countries must be held accountable for reducing it\n\n  * Landmark treaty on plastic pollution must put scientific evidence front and centre\n\n  * Three ways to solve the plastics pollution crisis\n\n  * Chemistry can make plastics sustainable \u2013 but isn\u2019t the whole solution\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Green chemistry\n  * Environmental sciences\n  * Policy\n\n## Latest on:\n\nHow synthetic biologists are building better biofactories\n\nTechnology Feature 01 APR 24\n\nA view of wind turbines drives down home values \u2014 but only briefly\n\nResearch Highlight 20 MAR 24\n\nHow science is helping farmers to find a balance between agriculture and solar\nfarms\n\nSpotlight 19 FEB 24\n\nEnvironmental drivers of increased ecosystem respiration in a warming tundra\n\nArticle 17 APR 24\n\nIt\u2019s time to talk about the hidden human cost of the green transition\n\nCorrespondence 16 APR 24\n\nThe world needs a COP for water like the one for climate change\n\nCorrespondence 16 APR 24\n\nWe must protect the global plastics treaty from corporate interference\n\nWorld View 17 APR 24\n\nSmoking bans are coming: what does the evidence say?\n\nNews 17 APR 24\n\nCanadian science gets biggest boost to PhD and postdoc pay in 20 years\n\nNews 17 APR 24\n\nHow synthetic biologists are building better biofactories\n\nTechnology Feature 01 APR 24\n\nA view of wind turbines drives down home values \u2014 but only briefly\n\nResearch Highlight 20 MAR 24\n\nHow science is helping farmers to find a balance between agriculture and solar\nfarms\n\nSpotlight 19 FEB 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### Postdoctoral Position\n\nWe are seeking highly motivated and skilled candidates for postdoctoral fellow\npositions\n\nBoston, Massachusetts (US)\n\nBoston Children's Hospital (BCH)\n\n  * #### Qiushi Chair Professor\n\nDistinguished scholars with notable achievements and extensive international\ninfluence.\n\nHangzhou, Zhejiang, China\n\nZhejiang University\n\n  * #### ZJU 100 Young Professor\n\nPromising young scholars who can independently establish and develop a\nresearch direction.\n\nHangzhou, Zhejiang, China\n\nZhejiang University\n\n  * #### Head of the Thrust of Robotics and Autonomous Systems\n\nReporting to the Dean of Systems Hub, the Head of ROAS is an executive\nassuming overall responsibility for the academic, student, human resources...\n\nGuangzhou, Guangdong, China\n\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)\n\n  * #### Head of Biology, Bio-island\n\nHead of Biology to lead the discovery biology group.\n\nGuangzhou, Guangdong, China\n\nBeiGene Ltd.\n\nDownload PDF\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * We must protect the global plastics treaty from corporate interference\n\n  * Plastic waste is everywhere and countries must be held accountable for reducing it\n\n  * Landmark treaty on plastic pollution must put scientific evidence front and centre\n\n  * Three ways to solve the plastics pollution crisis\n\n  * Chemistry can make plastics sustainable \u2013 but isn\u2019t the whole solution\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Green chemistry\n  * Environmental sciences\n  * Policy\n\n## Sign up to Nature Briefing\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your\ninbox every weekday.\n\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter \u2014 what matters in science, free to\nyour inbox daily.\n\nGet the most important science stories of the day, free in your inbox.
