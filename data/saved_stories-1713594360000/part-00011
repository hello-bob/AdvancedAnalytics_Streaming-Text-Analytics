Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Alibaba claims it will launch a server-grade RISC-V processor this year\n\nNews\n\nBy Anton Shilov\n\npublished March 20, 2024\n\nAlibaba continues to expand its RISC-V portfolio.\n\n(Image credit: T-Head)\n\nAlibaba's research division, the Damo Academy, recently announced expansion of\nits RISC-V efforts, which includes the Xuantie C907 matrix compute core and\nthe Xuantie C930 datacenter-oriented processor, according to Sohu. The server-\ngrade CPU is expected to be launched this year, reports The Register.\n\nOne of the ways for Chinese companies to sidestep U.S. export curbs regarding\nhigh-performance computing and artificial intelligence technologies is by\ndeveloping their own processors for AI and HPC based on their own cores (based\non the RISC-V instruction set architecture, or ISA). Alibaba's T-Head chip\ndivision was one of the first companies to realize the potential of the RISC-V\nISA a few years ago \u2014 so it has quite a lot of experience with the technology\nby now.\n\nT-Head introduced its first RISC-V-based Xuantie C910 processor for client\nsystems around two years ago and Alibaba has been selling PCs based on this\nCPU for a while. For some reason, the processor is no longer listed on the\ncompany's website. The same C910 core is used for the company's PCIe Gen5\nZhenyue 510 enterprise-class SSD controller that are used for a variety of\ndrives.\n\nNow the T-Head Xuantie 930 processor is set to power servers, including those\nmachines running artificial intelligence workloads \u2014 though it remains to be\nseen whether Alibaba plans to use them for its cloud datacenters, or for\nsomething else.\n\nIn addition, Alibaba's chip unit T-Head intends to introduce its Xuantie 907\nmatrix computing unit, though it's unclear whether we're dealing with a\nseparate datacenter SoC for AI workloads or an IP core that can be added to\nanother processor, say, to the Xuantie 910 or Xuantie 930.\n\n\"As the demand for new computing power surges, the development of RISC-V is\nundergoing a metamorphosis and is about to enter a period of application\nexplosion,\" said Zhang Jianfeng, president of the Damo Academy. \"The Damo\nAcademy will continue to increase its R&D investment and ecosystem co-building\nin RISC-V, promoting collaborative innovation and development of the industry\nupstream and downstream.\"\n\nSince native RISC-V technology is crucial for Chinese companies to avoid U.S.\nexport curbs, it's developing very fast in China. As a result, hardware and\nsoftware companies have been collaborating to create a competitive ecosystem\naround this ISA, the report from Sohu notes.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

For now it has a whole lot to catch up to.\n\nSoftware support on the server side is fairly robust already. Most of the\nmajor languages support RISC-V as a target. Java or JVM based languages like\nRuby or Java Script (NodeJs for example) not an issue, just install and run\n(C# support is currently in beta). C/C++ and Rust for example already have\nRISC-V target support on Linux, the software in many cases just needs to be\nrecompiled. Popular server operating environments such as Kubernetes and\nDocker already support RISC-V.\n\nRISC-V is behind in software support, but in truth for the server environment\nit's not that far behind.\n\nReply\n\n  * das_stig\n\nAlways had this crazy thought in my mind for an open source NAS/router.\nRisk-V, open socket, choose your number of cores and speed 2-4 ram slots for\nlarge memory capacity. 4-8 bays, maybe NVMe and 2.5\" SATA models 2 or more\nslots for off the shelf wifi cards for AP's 4+ LAN, minimum of 2.5G, maybe a\ncouple of 10G, managed switch TrueNas/Unraid + open source router/linux +\nother software in isolated containers/jails/vm's\n\nand if made in bulk, reasonable prices for all the components, yes I can dream\n:unsure:\n\nReply\n\n  * ahmad1900\n\n> JamesJones44 said:\n>\n> Software support on the server side is fairly robust already.

Don't know which\nsemiconductor is willing to produce it, will it use 7nm SMIC like the Kirin\n9000S?\n\nReply\n\n  * JamesJones44\n\n> ahmad1900 said:\n>\n> question, is risc v running well natively?

(Android, supports Risc V hardware. But it\ndoesn't seem like much compared to the dominant hardware arm.
