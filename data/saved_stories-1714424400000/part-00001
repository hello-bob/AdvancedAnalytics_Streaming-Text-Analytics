Why do words so often fail you when\nyou try to infect a friend with your enthusiasm for a person, a place, an\nidea? How do you teach someone file version management in the least number of\nwords? For someone who writes, this kind of frustration is part of the\nprocess. I feel it right now. But anyone who uses words or symbols to commune\nwith others, no matter the format, is intimately familiar with the feeling. We\ntake it for granted. But why is it so?\n\nI believe the answer is not in the complexity of those concepts, nor in a\nnihilistic worldview where we're all alone in this world and beyond salvation,\nbut in a system-centered interpretation of language.\n\nTo see that, we need only two concepts I've written about before (but will\nsummarize below): models and framings.\n\n## The Problem with Words\n\nA model is a system that predicts the future. It predicts only a small subset\nof the future, and it comes with a good deal of uncertainty, but it's an\ninvaluable tool for any living organism. This includes mental models, the\nmore-or-less-conscious, customizable models we humans cultivate in our heads.\nThey're how you know that a sip of water will make you feel less thirsty, and\nthat a certain kind of joke would not be appreciated by Linda. Ah, Linda.\n\nModels are able to make predictions of things before they happen because they\nare simpler than the things being simulated. They do away with the irrelevant\ndetails, and for that they are faster. That doing away is done with framings.\nThe way I define it, a framing is a choice of boundaries, or a choice of what\nto treat as a black box and what to see as interactions between black boxes.\nWe don't need to think about what goes on inside the boundaries of those black\nboxes, only what they are prone to do, and how they can interact with other\nblack boxes. Often we treat people as black boxes, for example, but also\nmachines, places, the weather, you name it.\n\nNow, all of this has little to do with language. The way we think (and a lot\nof what our bodies do without our need to think about it) is based on this\nkind of black-box mechanism, where we abstract away the things that don't\nmatter at the moment in order to make our much-needed predictions. It happens\ninside each of our crania. We grow our mental models and tend to them as our\nmost precious instruments\u2014appendages, almost.\n\nBut as long as there's more than one human being on Earth, we'll want to\ncommunicate. Sharing our good framings is a powerful way to help each other.\nThis leads to the question: if your mental models exist as the firing of\nneurons and the shifting of chemicals, how do you transfer them to someone\nelse using only your muscles?\n\nIt's not really possible. Or at least, it's not feasible.\n\nOne problem is that language, whatever its form, comes with its own framing\nbuilt in, what I call the Fundamental Framing of Human Language (FFHL). This\nis dictated by the use of words and sentences to communicate, and by the need\nfor those words to be understood by many. It means that, the moment we try to\nput our thoughts into words, we're forced to map our framings into the framing\nof the shared vocabulary. This is rarely a neat one-to-one mapping.\n\nWhen kung fu is uploaded to Neo's brain with a headjack cable, I bet it wasn't\nverbal information.\n\nIf I wanted to explain to you what the excellent pizza I had last night tasted\nlike, I'd had to reach for a series of words like \"crispy\", \"fresh\", \"earthy\",\n\"harmony of flavors\", and so on and so forth. These are emphatically not the\nterms in which I think about the flavor of pizza while I'm savoring it. I\ndon't use a black box for \"Mozzarella Cheese\", which interacts in some way or\nanother with the \"San Marzano Tomato sauce\" black box, and so on. My\nexperience is purely non-verbal\u2014with boundaries and simplifications, of\ncourse, but not those implied by those words.\n\nIf I were the one baking the pizza, my framing would be different, and I might\nindeed have black box concepts for each separate ingredient. But, even in that\ncase, I would probably tune their boundaries to my needs, for instance I might\nthink of the cheese only in its custom-sliced form, and the sauce as really\nwhole tomatoes picked no more than N days ago. In explaining the pizza-making\nprocess to others, I would have to leave off some of that nuance.\n\nIn other words, we always make a lossy conversion from one framing to another.\nThat doesn't mean that we can't build more sophisticated and accurate framings\nby piling on more words\u2014only that the very foundations are different. It's a\nbit like converting a non-analog photograph to digital. It often works just\nfine, but there are differences that can be of consequence (tiny details lost\ndue to pixelation, color space reduction, and digital artifacts to name a\nfew).\n\nAnother problem with language is that the best way to frame and model a system\ndepends entirely on your purpose, instant per instant. You need to make\npredictions because you have a purpose you're trying to achieve, be it\nremoving thirst or getting hired by a company. Purpose determines what the\n\"irrelevant\" bits are that you can stuff into the black boxes. It doesn't make\nsense to speak of framing and modeling the world without knowing what your\ngoal is.\n\nWe churn through our purposes really fast, too. Once the thirst is quenched,\nyour new goal might be to wash the glass: and suddenly what was the\nrefreshment-yielding \"Glass of Water\" black box a minute ago has been reframed\ninto a bacteria-collecting \"Dirty Glass\" black box. You're trying to predict\nanother aspect of reality, so you dynamically change your framing.\n\nBut what are the chances that the people you're talking or writing to have the\nsame purpose as you, at the same exact time?\n\nScant, the chances are.\n\nOther people usually have different purposes, so what for you is an optimal,\nwell-functioning framing and model, for other people is less than optimal.\n\nIn the 2019 movie Little Women, two of the main characters (Jo and Laurie) are\nso close that they often borrow each other's clothes. You might think they\nsuit both well enough... until you learn that the costume department had to\ntailor two versions of each garment due to their very different proportions.\n\nIt's a bit like sharing clothes with a sibling or a friend. Unless you both\nhave exactly the same body size and shape, the same hair and skin tone, the\nsame personality, it's likely that whatever suits one of you very well will\nlook less than stellar on the other.\n\nWe can't make that kind of relativism go away with language. All we can make\nis compromises. How do we do that, and does it work?\n\n## Mitigating the Bottleneck\n\nOf course, there's always the show-don't-tell approach. Instead of describing\nthe pizza, have the other taste it directly. Instead of writing instructions\non how to swing a racket, have the kid play tennis. But we're talking about\nlanguage now.\n\nOur default language-based strategy is to lean into the FFHL and pick\nvocabulary with the best balance between being fit to the purpose of your\nspecific audience and being accessible, i.e. known to them. For example, the\nWikipedia article about the videogame Baldur's Gate 3 begins like this:\n\n> Baldur's Gate 3 is a role-playing video game with single-player and\n> cooperative multiplayer elements. Players can create one or more characters\n> and form a party along with a number of pre-generated characters to explore\n> the game's story.\n\nThe assumption of the author is that the reader knows these specialized terms:\n\n  * role-playing\n  * video game\n  * single-player\n  * multiplayer\n  * party\n  * pre-generated character\n  * ...\n\nThat's a fair assumption. For most of the visitors on that page, the goal is\nsomething like \"decide whether the game is worth playing for me\" or\n\"understand the properties that set this game apart from the others\". In other\nwords, they're either gamers or game researchers (?). Given that context,\nframing \"role-playing video game\" as a black box (for instance) is a decent\nframing, and one that people are already used to converting to and from in\ntheir heads. But it's still not even close to conveying what every player of\nthat game understands directly: what this particular game feels like to play,\nand how you play it in practice.\n\nSo, besides employing off-the-shelf terminology, we use two more strategies:\nincreasing the resolution and making up new terms.\n\nWords are cheap, so when the first few aren't enough to approximate the\nframings inside our heads, we can always add more words after them to increase\nthe resolution. We can break down the concept and go into detail about what we\nreally mean. This has the benefit, usually, of making the message accessible\nto a broader audience\u2014more multi-purpose\u2014because with more moving parts,\npeople will be able to make them interact in more ways in their own mental\nmodels.\n\nThe downside of increasing the resolution is that it takes an unbelievable\namount of time compared to the immediacy of the thoughts you're thinking.\n(This is when they say that a picture is worth a thousand words, and things to\nthat effect.)\n\nThe other strategy is to invent new words. This doesn't solve the problem of\nexplaining something for the first time, but it saves you a lot work once the\nnew term is established within the group. It's why scientific disciplines\u2014and\nreally all groups with common purposes\u2014are so rife with jargon. They cluster\nin groups that have similar purposes, and make words that define boundaries\nthat work well enough to be shared.\n\nIn Tetris, some really good players sometimes use this kind of crazy maneuver\nwith the T-shaped piece to win the game:\n\nIt would take a lot of words every time one wants to refer to this move, so\nthey've come up with a name for it: \"T-spin\". Now anyone in the Tetris\ncommunity can mention a T-spin on passing in their language and the others\nwill immediately map that back to their own framing of the maneuver.\n\nOf course, neologisms have the opposite downside compared to breaking down\nthings with more words, that is, they make the message more inaccessible to\noutsiders.\n\n## Is Language an Obstacle to Thinking?\n\nWhat about the thinking you do inside your head, when you're all alone?\nIdeally, that should allow you to disregard communicability and make the\ntrade-off 100% in favor of optimizing your mental models. Only in your own\nhead, with your uncompromised and well-understood\u2014or at least \"felt\"\u2014purposes,\ncan you really feel free to redraw all the boundaries, to ignore whatever\nprepackaged framings your culture may have forced upon you, and finally think\nclearly.\n\nThat's the ideal. In reality, things aren't so straightforward. For one thing,\nit's unclear how much one's \"thought language\" (the language one uses inside\ntheir head) affects the way we think and forces us into predetermined patterns\nof thought. This is one of the longest-running debates in linguistics, and\nthere are good arguments for and against both sides.\n\nWith my limited knowledge of the topic, I'd conservatively settle for a midway\npoint: our language probably affects our thinking, even when alone, at least\nin a \"soft\" way, not preventing us at all costs from forming certain thoughts\nthat it doesn't support, but making them more difficult and less intuitive.\n\nI also believe we always keep in a corner of our minds, even when trying to\nfigure things out independently, the knowledge that we'll probably have to\nexplain this stuff to someone else later on. Some people may unpack their\nthinking imagining that they're actually talking to someone. This might\nencourage us to remain in the shared playing field of the language, without\noverthrowing too many of its forms and rules. We're inherently social\ncreatures, and that probably affects what we do even when we are alone.\n\nWe don't know enough to say anything clear about this, but if the above\nhypothesis is true, then language could pose some obstacles to clear, free\nthought. On the other hand, we would only get a tiny fraction of our knowledge\nif we didn't have language, so it's an easy crime to forgive.\n\n## Pick Your Own Answer\n\nIn summary, language is incapable of transferring \"optimal\" framings and\nmodels between people. At most, it can transfer the best framings among those\nfeasible to share among people.\n\nThat's a big difference. Does it mean that we're doomed to be dumber because\nof all the limitations of words? Let me answer four times.\n\nYes, we're doomed, because we lose something in the conversion to and from\nsub-optimal language-based framings. Probably all major breakthroughs in\nthought have happened inside individual heads ruminating in thoughts beyond\nlanguage\u2014the Einsteins and the Shakespeares, the Maxwells and the Aristotles.\nOnly after having made the breakthrough, those people made the effort to put\nthem into imperfect words for others to clumsily word-grapple with. We don't\nknow if they were ever fully understood by anyone.\n\nNo, we're not doomed, because we have the ability, with enough exposure to the\nintended context and purpose, to re-hydrate the sub-optimal framings of\nlanguage into good models for ourselves. You can feel this when something that\nhas been explained to you at length finally clicks for you. It's not the words\ncarrying the message that have made it click, but your own language-less\npuzzle-solving inside your head. What's more, even if the framings and models\nyou reconstruct in your head are a bit different from the one in the source's\nhead, that's often a good thing. Your model might be a novel upgrade on the\noriginal one, or it could be more well-adapted to your own variant of the\npurpose.\n\nLanguage bottlenecks were a more acute problem during WW2.\n\nYes, we're doomed because \"languagification\" is a big overhead. A lot of the\ntime, when we say \"I need to think it through\", we mean that we need to spend\ntime about how to put it into words, not to understand or solve a problem. I\nthink that much less \"thinking through\" would be necessary if we didn't have\nto eventually share what we're thinking.\n\nNo (this is the last one), we're not doomed, because of the obvious network\neffects. If the overhead for language were really too big to be worth the\ntrouble, it would never have evolved in the first place. The effort and the\ndata-loss implied in communication is usually offset by the greater number of\nthinking heads, each with its own chance at making the necessary\nbreakthroughs.\n\n## So What?\n\nAfter all those words, I hope that at least the following (tentative)\ntakeaways have made it to your head more or less intact.\n\nFirst, intended context and goal are paramount when communicating. They're the\nbasis for any thought process. If the speaker/writer/gesturer/... isn't clear\non the receivers' assumed context and purpose, or vice versa, the\ncommunication will likely fail. Always clarify your assumptions.\n\nSecond, it's tempting to \"think in words\", using categories familiar to many,\nbut that might be a mistake. Try to break free from the external constraints\nof language when thinking by yourself. Use imagery, sounds, emotions, space,\nand gut instead: they have more dimensions and more elastic boundaries.\n\nThird, demanding \"exactitude of language\" is a laughable idea.\n\nFourth, communicating your thoughts is hard and it's fraught with errors and\nfrustration and, more often than not, it's well worth it all. \u25cf\n\nCover image:\n\nThe Telephone (circa 1884), Georg Pauli\n\nAll content is licensed under\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\n", "frontpage": false}
