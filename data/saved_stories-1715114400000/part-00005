State-of-the-art approaches use lifting, a technique where source\n> assembly code is translated to an architecture-independent intermediate\n> representation (IR) (for example, the LLVM IR) and use a pre-existing\n> compiler to recompile the IR to the target ISA. However, the hand-written\n> rules these lifters employ are sensitive to the particular compiler and\n> optimization level used to generate the code and require significant\n> engineering effort to support each new ISA. We propose Forklift, the first\n> neural lifter that learns how to translate assembly to LLVM IR using a\n> token-level encoder-decoder Transformer. We show how to incrementally add\n> support to new ISAs by fine tuning the assembly encoder and freezing the IR\n> decoder, improving the overall accuracy and efficiency. We collect millions\n> of parallel LLVM IR, x86, ARM, and RISC-V programs across compilers and\n> optimization levels to train Forklift and set up an input/output-based\n> accuracy harness. We evaluate Forklift on two challenging benchmark suites\n> and translate 2.5x more x86 programs than a state-of-the-art hand-written\n> lifter and 4.4x more x86 programs than GPT-4 as well as enabling translation\n> from new ISAs.\n\nSubjects:| Programming Languages (cs.PL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.16041 [cs.PL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.16041v1 [cs.PL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16041arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Jordi Armengol-Estap\u00e9 [view email] [v1] Mon, 1 Apr 2024 17:27:58 UTC\n(225 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Forklift: An Extensible Neural Lifter, by Jordi\nArmengol-Estap\\'e and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.PL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
