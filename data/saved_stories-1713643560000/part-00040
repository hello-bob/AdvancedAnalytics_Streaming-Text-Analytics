The newly discovered species is\nbelieved to have roamed the seas towards the end of the Triassic, about 202m\nyears ago.\n\nThe team have named the species Ichthyotitan severnensis, meaning \u201cgiant fish\nlizard of the Severn\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis giant probably represents the largest marine reptile formally\ndescribed,\u201d said Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist at the University of Bristol\nand co-author of the research, adding that comparisons with fossils from other\nichthyosaurs suggested the creature would have been about 25 metres in length\n\u2013 about the size of a blue whale.\n\n\u201cOf course, we have to be careful with such estimates because we are dealing\nwith fragments of giant bones,\u201d he added. \u201cBut nonetheless, simple scaling is\ncommonly used to estimate size, especially when comparative material is\nscarce.\u201d\n\nThe team say samples from the fossils suggest the creature was still growing.\nAnd there is another twist.\n\n\u201cWe believe these ichthyosaurs are the last surviving members of the family\ncalled shastasaurida, which went extinct during the global mass extinction\nevent at the end of the Triassic,\u201d said Lomax.\n\nWriting in the journal Plos One, Lomax and colleagues report how the first\npieces of the jawbone were discovered by Justin Reynolds and his daughter Ruby\n\u2013 co-authors of the paper \u2013 on the beach at Blue Anchor in May 2020, when Ruby\nwas 11.\n\nThe pair contacted Lomax, who alongside members of the Reynolds family, joined\nthe search for further pieces. Among those who also joined the hunt was Paul\nde la Salle, an expert from the Museum of Jurassic Marine Life in Dorset who\nin 2016 had discovered a jawbone from what appeared to be a new species of\nichthyosaur at a beach in Somerset. That specimen was subsequently studied by\nLomax and colleagues.\n\nIchthyotitan severnensis is thought to have become extinct at the end of the\nTriassic period. Illustration: Sergey Krasovskiy\n\nWhen the team fitted the fragments of the new fossil together they found it\nbelonged to the same species as the specimen discovered by De la Salle.\n\nIn both cases the fossilised bone is the surangular \u2013 a long, curved structure\nthat sits at the top and back of the lower jaw.\n\nLomax said: \u201cWhen my team described the first specimen in 2018, it showed\nunusual features that suggested it might represent something new. However, we\nrefrained from giving it a name, considering that it was incomplete and also\npartly eroded.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving two examples of the same bone with the same unique features from the\nsame geologic time zone supports our identifications of something new,\nespecially when combined with the fact that these two bones appear roughly 13m\nyears after their latest geologic relatives with a name,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Nick Fraser, a palaeontologist at National Museums Scotland, who was not\ninvolved in the study, said the identification of the bone as part of the\nlower jaw from an ichthyosaur was very convincing.\n\n\u201cIt hints that its one-time owner was a gigantic beast, possibly one of the\nlargest marine reptiles of all time,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Fraser said it was questionable whether the creature should be assigned as\na new species. \u201cFor me it is a bit too incomplete for that,\u201d he said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Fossils\n  * Palaeontology\n  * Somerset\n  * Dinosaurs\n  * Animals\n  * Marine life\n  * Biology\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
