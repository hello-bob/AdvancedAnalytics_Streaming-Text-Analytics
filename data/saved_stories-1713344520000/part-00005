He had just kissed his girlfriend goodnight and was on his way\nhome to pack: The next day he was escaping Michigan\u2019s frozen Upper Peninsula\nfor spring break in Florida.\n\n\u201cWho is you?\u201d he responded.\n\nTall, athletic and blond, Jordan was a football and basketball star at\nMarquette Senior High School, as well as its homecoming king. The 17-year-old\noften received friend requests from random girls on social media. He liked the\nattention.\n\nThis one came from Dani Robertts. Her profile photo showed a teenager with a\ncute smile, sunglasses perched atop shiny brown hair, hugging a German\nshepherd. Dani told Jordan she was from Texas but was going to high school in\nGeorgia. They had one mutual friend and started texting about school life\nwhile he did his laundry.\n\nAround midnight, Dani got flirtatious. She told Jordan she liked \u201cplaying sexy\ngames.\u201d Then she sent him a naked photo and asked for one in return, a \u201csexy\npic\u201d with his face in it. Jordan walked down the hallway to the bathroom,\npulled down his pants and took a selfie in the mirror. He hit send.\n\nIn an instant, the flirty teenage girl disappeared.\n\n\u201cI have screenshot all your followers and tags and can send this nudes to\neveryone and also send your nudes to your family and friends until it goes\nviral,\u201d Dani wrote. \u201cAll you have to do is cooperate with me and I won\u2019t\nexpose you.\u201d\n\nMinutes later: \u201cI got all I need rn to make your life miserable dude.\u201d\n\nJordan DeMay was a football star at Marquette Senior High School. Courtesy:\nFamily\n\nJordan\u2019s tormentor knew his high school, his football team, his parents\u2019\nnames, his address. Dani had created photo collages of his family and friends\nand plastered his nude picture in the middle. One screenshot had his nude\nselfie in a direct message addressed to his girlfriend. Dani said Jordan had\n10 seconds to pay, or the message would be sent.\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d Jordan responded.\n\nThe price was $300. He transferred the money via Apple Cash and pleaded to be\nleft alone. But it wasn\u2019t enough. Now Dani wanted $800. Jordan sent a\nscreenshot of his bank account showing a balance of $55, offering to send\neverything he had.\n\n\u201cNo deal,\u201d Dani replied.\n\nBy 3 a.m., Jordan was starting to unravel.\n\nJordan:Why are you doing this to me? I am begging for my own life.\n\nDani:10 ... 9 ... 8 ... I bet your GF will leave you for some other dude.\n\nJordan:I will be dead. Like I want to KMS [kill myself]\n\nDani:Sure. I will watch you die a miserable death.\n\nJordan:It\u2019s over. You win bro .... I am kms rn. Bc of you.\n\nDani:Good. Do that fast. Or I\u2019ll make you do it. I swear to God.\n\nIt was early 2022 when analysts at the National Center for Missing & Exploited\nChildren (NCMEC) noticed a frightening pattern. The US nonprofit has fielded\nonline-exploitation cybertips since 1998, but it had never seen anything like\nthis.\n\nFeatured in Bloomberg Businessweek, April 22, 2024. Subscribe now.\nIllustration: 731\n\nHundreds of tips began flooding in from across the country, bucking the trend\nof typical exploitation cases. Usually, older male predators spend months\ngrooming young girls into sending nude photos for their own sexual\ngratification. But in these new reports, teen boys were being catfished by\nindividuals pretending to be teen girls\u2014and they were sending the nude photos\nfirst. The extortion was rapid-fire, sometimes occurring within hours. And it\nwasn\u2019t sexually motivated; the predators wanted money. The tips were coming\nfrom dozens of states, yet the blackmailers were all saying the same thing:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ruin your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make it go viral.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnswer me quickly. Time is ticking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have what I need to destroy your life.\u201d\n\nIn January 2022 the center received 100 reports of financially motivated\nsexual extortion. In February it was 173. By March, 259. The numbers were\ntrending up so quickly and the script was so similar that the analysts\nreported it directly to Lauren Coffren, the executive director of the center\u2019s\nexploited children division. \u201cThe bad actors were so fast and so ruthless,\u201d\nCoffren says. Last year, after the center asked social media platforms to\nstart tracking the crime, NCMEC received more than 20,000 such reports.\n\n#### Sextortion Cases\n\nMonthly reports of sextortion made to NCMEC\n\nNote: NCMEC requested that platforms report cases starting in July 2022\nSource: National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\n\nThe scam, which the FBI calls sextortion, has become one of the fastest-\ngrowing crimes targeting children in the US, according to the agency. In an\n18-month period ending in March 2023, the FBI says, at least 20 minors,\nprimarily boys, killed themselves after falling victim to the scam. (Seven\nmore sextortion-related suicides have been reported since then, the latest in\nJanuary.) The crime is \u201cjust out of control,\u201d says Mark Civiletto, a\nsupervisory special agent in the FBI\u2019s Lansing, Michigan, office. \u201cThis is\nsomething that\u2019s touching every neighborhood across the country.\u201d\n\nThe FBI, Civiletto says, is used to handling online fraud cases, such as\nromance scams or elder abuse, which require a long runway so the perpetrator\ncan build rapport with their victims. Sextortion can be done in minutes.\nScammers have zeroed in on a faster method, Civiletto says, one that returns a\nhigher payout by exploiting the shame and embarrassment of teenage boys. And\nsocial media has given scammers a direct line to American teens. With the\nswipe of a thumb, criminals can see a scrapbook of these kids\u2019 lives,\nincluding the names of their friends and family members.\n\nLast year a Snap Inc. survey of more than 6,000 young social media users in\nsix countries including the US found that almost half said they had been\ntargeted in an online sextortion scheme. One-third of those said they had\nshared an intimate photo.\n\nThe scammers have been bold enough to publish playbooks for how to commit this\ntype of blackmail via TikTok and YouTube, in clear violation of social media\nplatforms\u2019 community guidelines. Both companies said in written statements\nthat they had removed posts related to this scam that have been brought to\ntheir attention and vowed to continue to take down such content. But a search\non both platforms found similar content is still available.\n\nRead More: Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation of Teenage\nSextortion\n\nIn late January the chief executive officers of the world\u2019s biggest platforms,\nincluding Meta, Snap and TikTok, were grilled during a congressional hearing\nabout how their companies have endangered a generation of children. There were\nquestions about addictive algorithms and youth suicide rates\u2014and the sudden\nrise of sextortion.\n\nAt one point in the hearing, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms Inc.,\nwhich owns Instagram, was asked to say something to the dozens of bereaved\nparents sitting in the gallery, holding photos of their dead children. \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry for everything you have all been through,\u201d he said.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, addresses parents of children harmed\nby social media at a Senate hearing in January. Photographer: Kent\nNishimura/Bloomberg\n\nThe 911 call blared over the sheriff\u2019s office radio in the picturesque\nlakeside city of Marquette at 7:40 a.m. on a Friday morning: \u201c17-year-old\nsuicide, gunshot.\u201d Detectives Lowell Larson and Jason Hart caught each other\u2019s\neye. Suicides in the area were rare; the sheriff\u2019s office had responded to\nonly three the previous year. Teen suicides were even rarer. They ran to an\nunmarked Chevy Tahoe, leaving two steaming coffee cups behind. The sun was\njust beginning to rise over Lake Superior.\n\nThe detectives arrived at the scene within minutes. John DeMay, a former\npolice officer who went to school with Larson, was standing in the doorway of\nhis beige split-level house, wide-eyed and wearing a T-shirt despite the\nbelow-freezing temperature. \u201cMy son ... \u201d he started. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, John,\u201d Larson\nsaid, placing a hand on his shoulder. Hart guided DeMay upstairs, and Larson\nwalked toward Jordan\u2019s bedroom.\n\nHe took a deep breath and stepped inside. Jordan was sitting upright in his\nbed, leaning against a blood-spattered wall. His left arm hung from the\nmattress, and his right hand held a pistol. His cellphone was in his lap, the\nscreen lighting up with messages.\n\nJohn DeMay is still grieving his son\u2019s death. Photographer: Kevin Serna for\nBloomberg Businessweek\n\nLarson photographed the scene. He pulled on a pair of black nitrile gloves\nbefore picking up Jordan\u2019s phone, switching it to airplane mode and sliding it\ninto a paper bag. He also bagged the gun, which belonged to Jordan\u2019s father,\nand the cartridges, entering it all into the case file.\n\nThe \u201cwhat\u201d of the case was already clear, Larson recalls two years later from\nbehind his desk at the sheriff\u2019s office, raccoon and beaver hides splayed on a\nwall behind him. It was the \u201cwhy\u201d that was disturbing him.\n\nLooking around Jordan\u2019s messy bedroom that morning, Larson didn\u2019t see a\nsuicide note. Jordan had no history of unhappiness or mental illness. His bag\nwas packed with swimsuits and sunscreen, ready for Florida. The alarm on his\nphone kept going off. Everything Larson could see indicated that when Jordan\ngot into bed, he intended to wake up.\n\nJordan\u2019s bedroom at his mother\u2019s house in Marquette, Michigan. Photographer:\nKevin Serna for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA jersey worn by Jordan. Photographer: Kevin Serna for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJennifer Buta, Jordan\u2019s mother, in his bedroom. Photographer: Kevin Serna for\nBloomberg Businessweek\n\nKyla Palomaki was in class but couldn\u2019t concentrate. Text messages to her\nboyfriend weren\u2019t going through. She kept rereading Jordan\u2019s last cryptic\nmessage, sent at 3:30 a.m.: \u201cKyla, I love you so much. I made a mistake and\nwish I could continue but I can\u2019t do this anymore. This was a choice I made\nand I must pay myself.\u201d\n\nJordan had left her house at about 10 the night before. What mistake could he\npossibly have made in the early morning hours? He hadn\u2019t replied to three\nphone calls and eight text messages, including her last one that just said\n\u201cJORDAN!\u201d The only message she\u2019d received about Jordan that morning was from\nhis mom, Jennifer Buta, asking whether he was in school\u2014which seemed odd.\n\nShe was sitting in her second-period class, watching a movie she couldn\u2019t care\nless about. Kyla, an A student who goes to church every Sunday, was instead\nstaring at her phone, willing Jordan to reply. She recalls that at this point\nher unease was giving way to fear.\n\nWhen the school administrator knocked on the classroom door, Kyla prayed that\nher name wouldn\u2019t be called. It was. The administrator wouldn\u2019t answer any of\nher questions on the one-minute walk to the principal\u2019s office or even look\nher in the eye. When she saw her mom and dad inside the office crying, she\nmelted to the floor. \u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d she screamed.\n\nThe next student pulled from class was Justin Jurmu. His dad was sitting\nstone-faced in the assistant principal\u2019s office, waiting for him, they both\nrecall. \u201cJordan\u2019s gone, buddy,\u201d Justin\u2019s father said softly. \u201cHe shot himself\nlast night.\u201d\n\nJordan had been Justin\u2019s best friend since they were 8. \u201cThere\u2019s no way, Dad,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThere is zero chance Jordan is gone.\u201d For 10 minutes, he shook his\nhead, growing increasingly agitated.\n\nThen he saw Kyla leaving the school, propped up by her parents. He watched her\ncollapse, shoulders heaving. Her dad scooped her up and folded her into the\nback seat of his car. Justin howled.\n\nEveryone in the school knew Jordan. He was the guy everybody was jealous of,\nthe one who picked up a hockey stick and just knew how to play. He danced in\nthe hallways between classes, headphones plugged in, blasting rap music. He\nhad a big ego and wasn\u2019t afraid to admit it. \u201cJeez, how can one young man be\nso happy all the time?\u201d his football coach, Eric Mason, asked Jordan a week\nearlier. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way I am, Coach,\u201d Jordan chimed back.\n\nThe Marquette Senior High School football field where Jordan played.\nPhotographer: Kevin Serna for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMarquette is a city of 20,000 where front doors are rarely locked and stolen\nmountain bikes make the news. Nothing stays secret for long. The school\nadministrator who escorted Kyla to the principal\u2019s office is also her next-\ndoor neighbor. Kyla\u2019s dad attended high school with Detective Larson\u2019s sister\nand now works at the local bank where John DeMay is a client.\n\nKyla\u2019s parents had been high school sweethearts. They had married and had\nchildren young. Kyla and Jordan talked about doing the same. Jordan started\nattending church with her family and scrapped plans to seek a basketball\nscholarship at an out-of-state school. He applied to Northern Michigan\nUniversity in Marquette, where Kyla was planning to go.\n\nFor their one-year anniversary, he asked his mom for Kohl\u2019s cash to buy Kyla a\npromise ring. On her 18th birthday card, he wrote: \u201cI want to spend the rest\nof my life with you. You would be such an amazing wife, mother, grandma,\neverything, and I cannot wait for those days to come.\u201d He wore hair ties\naround his wrist in case she needed to pull her wavy blond hair into a\nponytail. He was wearing one when he died.\n\nKyla\u2019s phone wouldn\u2019t stop vibrating. People were messaging her, asking if it\nwas true that Jordan was dead. Rumors were spreading that Kyla had dumped him\nand that\u2019s why he killed himself. She decided to get out of the house. That\nafternoon, she and a friend drove to Presque Isle Park, where Kyla and Jordan\nwould go to watch the sun set. They parked at the end of the road, facing the\nlake, and tried to reckon with what had happened.\n\nKyla Palomaki, Jordan\u2019s girlfriend, looks at his Instagram profile.\nPhotographer: Kevin Serna for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nKyla under a photo of the couple in her bedroom. Photographer: Kevin Serna for\nBloomberg Businessweek\n\nAs Kyla fixated on the last text Jordan had sent her, new Instagram messages\nkept popping up. Strangers were finding her account because Jordan\u2019s public\nInstagram profile looked like a tribute to her. Half of his photos were of the\ntwo of them together, kissing, cuddling, dancing at prom.\n\nOne message was from someone named Dani Robertts. The message contained no\nwords, just a photo of Jordan exposing himself in his bathroom mirror.\n\nKyla stopped breathing. This was the first nude photo of Jordan she\u2019d ever\nseen. He was wearing the red, white and pink plaid pajama bottoms that matched\nher own and the T-shirt he\u2019d had on when he left her house. She looked at the\ntime stamp: 3:30 a.m.\n\nThis must be the mistake he was talking about. \u201cI need you to drop me home\nnow,\u201d she told her friend. Then she replied to Dani Robertts.\n\nKyla:What is this about?\n\nDani:Do you know him?\n\nKyla:Do you?\n\nDani:Answer me\n\nKyla:Who are you?\n\nDani:I bet you know him.\n\nKyla:That\u2019s my boyfriend why\n\nDani:I swear I will ruin his life with this\n\nKyla:He killed himself last night. Please don\u2019t\n\nDani:Do you want me to ruin his life?\n\nKyla:He\u2019s gone. No\n\nDani:Do you want me to ruin his life? Yes or no\n\nKyla:He\u2019s already ruined. Wdym\n\nDani:He his [sic] going to be in jail\n\nKyla:HES DEAD\n\nDani:And this will go viral\n\nKyla:HE SHOT HIMSELF\n\nDani:Haha. Do you want me to end this. And delete the pics? Yes or no....\nCooperate with me and this will end... Just do as I say and all this will end.\n\nDani started video-calling Kyla on repeat. Kyla ran to her parents. \u201cSomething\nhappened last night,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cSomeone has a nude picture of Jordan.\u201d\n\nBy the time word of the nude selfie got to Larson, it was late that Friday\nnight. He immediately called Kyla. She told him about her message exchange\nwith Dani Robertts, and Larson asked her for screenshots so he could\ninvestigate. He hung up at 10 p.m., ending a 15-hour shift, but at least now\nhe was one step closer to the \u201cwhy.\u201d\n\nFirst thing Saturday, he drove to the sheriff\u2019s office. It was his day off,\nbut he had to file a preservation request with Meta for all records associated\nwith the Jordan DeMay and Dani Robertts accounts.\n\nMeta has a portal for police to file requests to preserve records of accounts\nconnected to criminal investigations. Like other social media companies, it\nhas to hold the records\u2014including emails, IP addresses, message transcripts\nand general usage history\u2014for 90 days. It only hands over user data if it\u2019s\nordered to do so by a court.\n\nThere\u2019s one way to expedite the request: file it as an emergency, meaning a\nchild could be harmed or there\u2019s risk of death. Larson believed this case\nqualified. He told Meta that a 17-year-old was already dead, and there was a\nhigh probability other kids were in danger, too.\n\nMeta declined his request within an hour, he says. \u201cThe request you submitted\ndoes not rise to the level of an emergency,\u201d the company responded.\n\nJordan\u2019s tombstone in Marquette. Photographer: Kevin Serna for Bloomberg\nBusinessweek\n\n\u201cScrew you,\u201d Larson thought. He drafted an affidavit and looked up the county\nmagistrate who was on call that weekend. He asked her to sign a search warrant\nand a nondisclosure order so Larson could gain access to Dani Robertts\u2019\nrecords without alerting whoever was using the account that an investigation\nwas underway. Larson got the signed documents back later that day and\nforwarded them to Meta. Then he waited.\n\n\u201cI was helpless,\u201d Larson says. \u201cI was at their mercy.\u201d (A Meta spokesperson\ndeclined to answer Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s questions about the matter.)\n\nThe following night, as Larson was getting into bed, he received a\nnotification that the judge-ordered report from Meta was ready. The five-hour\nmessage exchange between Dani Robertts and Jordan DeMay was worse than he\ncould have imagined. He read it twice, adrenaline pumping at the brazenness of\nthe blackmailer.\n\n\u201cI will watch you die a miserable death.\u201d\n\nLarson had found his why. His next question was who. It was clear to him that\nthe messages had not been written by a teenage girl.\n\nThe Dani Robertts Instagram account records contained a clue: time-stamped IP\naddresses\u2014a unique set of numbers that identifies a specific device on the\ninternet. Larson plugged them into a geolocation tool, and it kicked back\nlatitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. Whoever was running the Dani\nRobertts account was based in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nLarson called a friend, an agent in the FBI\u2019s Marquette field office. \u201cYou got\na minute?\u201d Larson said. \u201cI might need some help.\u201d\n\nLowell Larson, an avid hunter-trapper, says he applies the same skills to his\ndetective work by thinking about behavior patterns of his prey. Photographer:\nKevin Serna for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThat day, Jordan\u2019s red iPhone XR was dropped off at the Michigan State Police\nComputer Crimes Unit in Marquette. Ryan Frazier, a digital forensics analyst\nwho\u2019d been on the force 10 months, opened the sealed evidence bag. He\u2019d\nalready heard about Jordan\u2019s death and recognized his name. He\u2019d played for\nthe same high school football team a few years earlier.\n\nFrazier needed a four-digit passcode to unlock the device. He tried Jordan\u2019s\nbirthday and those of his four younger sisters and his girlfriend. Then he\ncalled Jordan\u2019s basketball and football coaches to ask about his jersey\nnumbers. He wore 05 on the court and 02 on the field. Bingo. The device\nunlocked.\n\nFrazier was able to extract a full file system from the phone until the moment\nof Jordan\u2019s death. It was a digital footprint of Jordan\u2019s usage history,\nincluding what applications were active, what time they were opened, what\nmessages he sent and when. Frazier returned the iPhone to the sheriff\u2019s office\nthe next day along with his report.\n\nLarson noticed there was no message history with Dani Robertts. Jordan had\ndeleted the conversation before he killed himself. The last activity on the\nphone was his 3:30 a.m. message to Kyla and one he sent to his mom: \u201cMother, I\nlove you.\u201d\n\nRecounting the specifics, Larson\u2019s bottom lip starts to quiver. An imposing\nfigure with a buzz cut, he asks to pause the interview, gets up from his desk,\nadjusts his holster and walks to the back of his office, looking for a tissue.\n\u201cThis case,\u201d he mumbles under his breath, \u201cit\u2019s haunting.\u201d\n\nA memorial page dedicated to Jordan in the Marquette Senior High School\nyearbook. Photographer: Kevin Serna for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBy mid-2022 sextortion was dominating NCMEC\u2019s cybertip report line. In June\nthe center summoned social media companies to an urgent meeting to warn them\nabout the scam. More than 50 people joined the call, including representatives\nfrom Meta, Snap and TikTok.\n\nNCMEC\u2019s Coffren says she described the targets, the motives and the mechanics\nof the crime, warning that some teenage boys had already killed themselves.\n\u201cWe need you to take action. Fast.\u201d\n\nThe month after the call, the 17-year-old son of Brandon Guffey, a Republican\nSouth Carolina state representative, received an Instagram message late on a\nTuesday night. \u201cYour cute,\u201d it said. The message was from a biracial girl\nwearing a crop top in her profile photo. Her bio said she was a freshman at a\nnearby college.\n\nGavin Guffey was in his bedroom playing video games with friends online. He\ntold them he was going to drop off to chat with a girl. It didn\u2019t take long\nfor the conversation to turn risqu\u00e9. She sent a sexy photo and asked for one\nin return. When he complied, she threatened to forward it to everyone he was\nfriends with on Instagram unless he sent her money. He paid $25 via Venmo. It\nwasn\u2019t enough. Around 1 a.m. she sent a mock-up of a news story with his photo\nand the headline \u201cGavin Guffey Caught Sending Nudes on the Internet.\u201d\n\nBrandon Guffey, a South Carolina state representative, at a Senate hearing in\nJanuary holding a portrait of his son Gavin. Photographer: Tom Williams/CQ-\nRoll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nAccording to his father, who\u2019s seen a transcript of the conversation, Gavin\nwrote back that he was going to end his life if the photos came out. Less than\nan hour later, he did.\n\nHis father, who had just returned from a political event, heard a shot from\ninside the bathroom and kicked down the door. His son was already gone.\n\nA few days later, while planning Gavin\u2019s funeral, Guffey got a call from an\naunt who shares the same last name. She said her 14-year-old son had been\ncontacted online by someone claiming to be Gavin\u2019s girlfriend, saying\ndangerous people were blackmailing her over nude photos of Gavin. She said\nthey were going to ruin her life if she didn\u2019t pay them $2,000.\n\nWhen Guffey opened his own Instagram account, he found a similar message. \u201cShe\nsaid she needed to talk to me right away and that she was going to ruin my\npolitical career,\u201d Guffey says.\n\nA month later, in August 2022, Guffey was in Myrtle Beach with his wife to\nmark what would have been Gavin\u2019s 18th birthday. He was sitting on the back\ndeck of a family member\u2019s condo with a glass of bourbon, smoking a cigarette,\nwhen a WhatsApp message from a random number flashed on his screen. It said:\n\u201cDid you know your son begged for his life \ud83d\ude02\u201d.\n\nGuffey snapped. \u201cI will f---ing end you,\u201d he replied. A back-and-forth between\nGuffey and the scammer ensued, lasting for hours. They sent him photos of his\nhouse from Google Street View, threatening to break in. He invited them to do\nso: \u201cI will kill you with my bare hands.\u201d In the end, the scammer told Guffey\nhe was sorry about what had happened to his son and said he\u2019d been hired by a\npolitical opponent. No arrests have been made, but Guffey says an FBI\ninvestigation is ongoing. The FBI didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSince sharing the story of his son\u2019s death, Guffey says he no longer silences\nhis phone at night. That isn\u2019t for the blackmailers; it\u2019s for their victims.\nHe says he\u2019s received about 200 calls from teens, usually between midnight and\n3 a.m.: \u201cI\u2019ll answer, and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Mr. Guffey, what happened to Gavin is\nhappening to me. Please help!\u2019 \u201d\n\nBy early 2023, FBI agents in Michigan were homing in on an apartment complex\nin Lagos. Social media records and email addresses obtained from Apple, Google\nand Meta linked two brothers who lived there to the crime. Buried inside their\nGmail and iCloud accounts, FBI agents found evidence that Samuel and Samson\nOgoshi, 22 and 20, respectively, had bought hacked Instagram accounts,\nincluding the one being used by the fictitious Dani Robertts. They had 12\nphotos including the profile picture of the account\u2019s original owner, a\nteenage girl who hasn\u2019t been identified, as well as the nude photo of Jordan\nDeMay and the Photoshopped collage sent to torment him. Their emails contained\na word-for-word script of what was in the messages sent to Jordan the night he\ndied.\n\nThe FBI found evidence that the brothers had used the Dani Robertts account to\nmessage Jordan and target more than 100 other victims in the US, according to\ncourt records. On the same day Jordan died, they were messaging another victim\nin Warrens, Wisconsin, threatening to \u201cmake u commit suicide.\u201d\n\nThe agents also found an incriminating Google search history that included\n\u201cInstagram blackmail death,\u201d \u201cMichigan suicide,\u201d \u201chow to hide my IP address\nwithout VPN?\u201d and \u201chow can FBI track my IP from another country.\u201d\n\nSamson Ogoshi.

Source: Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nigeria\n\nThe Ogoshi brothers were arrested by Nigerian authorities in January 2023.\nCourt records show they come from a middle-class family. Their father is a\nretired member of the military, and their mother runs a small business selling\nsoft drinks in their apartment complex. The boys grew up attending church,\nsinging in the choir and playing soccer with neighborhood friends. The older\nbrother, Samuel, was studying sociology at Nasarawa State University, while\nSamson was training to be a cobbler.\n\nIn August the brothers left Nigeria for the first time, escorted by the FBI.\nThey were extradited to Grand Rapids, Michigan, to face federal charges in\nconnection with the death of Jordan DeMay. A third defendant, Ezekiel Robert,\nhas been arrested and is appealing a Nigerian extradition order.\n\nThe FBI says the Ogoshi brothers and Robert worked with three unnamed co-\nconspirators, according to court documents. They bought the hacked Instagram\naccount from one and got the victims to pay a US-based money mule, someone who\nconverted the payment into cryptocurrency before sending it to another co-\nconspirator in Nigeria. The Ogoshi brothers told the FBI they received only a\nportion of the money they extorted.\n\nDuring the brothers\u2019 extradition proceedings, the US government promised it\nwouldn\u2019t seek the death penalty. On April 10 they pleaded guilty to conspiring\nto sexually exploit teenage boys and face mandatory sentences of 15 years in\nprison. The maximum possible penalty is 30 years. Their attorneys didn\u2019t\nrespond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the meantime, they are being held in a county jail in White Cloud,\nMichigan, about an hour north of Grand Rapids and 6,000 miles from Lagos. They\nhaven\u2019t been allowed to speak to each other. For entertainment, they have\nplaying cards, books and a communal TV. They get one hour of recreation a day\nin a small outdoor courtyard.\n\nOne morning in February, as icicles hung from the barbed wire, Samson Ogoshi\nopted to stay inside. Wearing open-toe sandals and white socks, his orange\njumpsuit pants rolled up above his ankles, he did squats with other inmates in\na communal day room as a Businessweek reporter watched on a security camera.\nWith snow piling up knee-deep in the courtyard, Ogoshi must have felt out of\nplace, says the county sheriff, who\u2019s in charge of the jail; he\u2019d probably\nnever seen snow before.\n\nIn November another Nigerian, Olamide Oladosu Shanu, was indicted for running\na similar sextortion ring that received more than $2.5 million in Bitcoin from\nvictims. The US Secret Service spent months investigating Shanu, who allegedly\nworked with four co-conspirators to hack social media accounts of teenage\ngirls in the US and persuade teenage boys to send nude photos and videos of\nthemselves, according to a 21-page indictment filed in federal court in Idaho.\n\nThe Ogoshi and Shanu alleged crime rings are the modus operandi of Nigeria\u2019s\nYahoo Boys, according to a January report written by Paul Raffile, an analyst\nat the Network Contagion Research Institute in Princeton, New Jersey.\nNicknamed after the Yahoo.com emails they used to swindle thousands of\nunsuspecting Westerners into sending money, often posing as Nigerian princes,\nthe Yahoo Boys are a group of digitally savvy con men who design new scams and\nencourage others to copy them.\n\nRaffile found hundreds of instructional videos on TikTok and YouTube about how\nto blackmail teens. They were posted by young men in Nigeria who used the\nhashtags #YahooBoysFormat and #BlackmailFormat. The how-to guides advised\ntargeting, or \u201cbombing,\u201d American high schools and sports teams to make\nfriends with as many kids as possible from the same community. One of Jordan\u2019s\nfootball teammates was a mutual friend of Dani Robertts\u2019, which made her\naccount appear legitimate.\n\nRaffile says he started studying sextortion last year after a friend was\nblackmailed and asked for help. He read victims\u2019 stories in news reports,\nReddit forums and social media posts and was struck by the similarities of\ntheir experiences, especially when it came to the blackmail script. \u201cThere was\nsome mystery to this,\u201d Raffile says, \u201clike invisible organized crime.\u201d\n\nThe Yahoo Boys videos provided guidance on how to sound like an American girl\n(\u201cI\u2019m from Massachusetts. I just saw you on my friend\u2019s suggestion and decided\nto follow you. I love reading, chilling with my friends and tennis\u201d). They\noffered suggestions for how to keep the conversation flowing, how to turn it\nflirtatious and how to coerce the victim into sending a nude photo (\u201cPic\nexchange but with conditions\u201d). Those conditions often included instructions\nthat boys hold their genitals while \u201cmaking a cute face\u201d or take a photo in a\nmirror, face included.\n\nOnce that first nude image is sent, the script says, the game begins. \u201cNOW\nBLACKMAIL \ud83d\ude00!!\u201d it tells the scammer, advising they start with \u201chey, I have ur\nnudes and everything needed to ruin your life\u201d or \u201chey this is the end of your\nlife I am sending nudes to the world now.\u201d Some of the blackmail scripts\nRaffile found had been viewed more than half a million times. One, called\n\u201cBlackmailing format,\u201d was uploaded to YouTube in September 2022 and got\nthousands of views. It included the same script that was sent to Jordan\nDeMay\u2014down to the typos.\n\nWhile YouTube and TikTok are the preferred platforms for how-to videos, the\nextortion typically happens on Instagram or Snapchat, according to Raffile\u2019s\nreport. Instagram contains extensive personal information blackmailers can use\nto torment victims, including their location, school and friends. Snap\u2019s\ndisappearing messages give users a false sense of security that their images\naren\u2019t being saved. Both companies say they have zero tolerance for this crime\nand have vowed to do more to protect their users.\n\nSnap has been \u201cramping up our tools to combat\u201d sextortion, a company\nspokesperson says. \u201cWe have extra safeguards for teens to protect against\nunwanted contact and don\u2019t offer public friend lists, which we know can be\nused to extort people.\u201d\n\nAntigone Davis, Meta\u2019s global head of safety, said in an emailed statement\nthat sextortion \u201cis a horrific crime, and we\u2019ve spent years building\ntechnology to combat it and to support law enforcement in investigating and\nprosecuting the criminals behind it.\u201d She said scammers keep changing their\ntactics, but the company tracks new trends \u201cso we can regularly improve our\ntools and systems.\u201d\n\nMeta says it\u2019s using artificial intelligence to detect suspicious activity on\nthe platform and to blur nudity and is now showing teens a sextortion-focused\nsafety notice if they message with a suspicious account. And it has helped run\na training session in Abuja, Nigeria, to educate law enforcement and\nprosecutors there. Meta is also a founding member of Take It Down, an\ninitiative launched by NCMEC last year for teens to flag intimate images and\nblock them from being shared across social media.\n\nRaffile says none of the companies contacted him after his report was\npublished and before Businessweek made inquiries. Social media companies\n\u201ccould have curbed this crime from the beginning,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a disastrous\nintelligence failure that over the past 18 months all these deaths and all\nthis trauma was preventable with sufficient moderation.\u201d\n\nJohn DeMay at his home in Marquette. Photographer: Kevin Serna for Bloomberg\nBusinessweek\n\nIn January, Jordan\u2019s parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit in a California\nstate court accusing Meta of enabling and facilitating the crime. That month,\nJohn DeMay flew to Washington to attend the congressional hearing with social\nmedia executives. He sat in the gallery holding a picture of Jordan smiling in\nhis red football jersey.\n\nThe DeMay case has been combined with more than 100 others in a group lawsuit\nin Los Angeles that alleges social media companies have harmed children by\ndesigning addictive products. The cases involve content sent to vulnerable\nteens about eating disorders, suicide and dangerous challenges leading to\naccidental deaths, as well as sextortion.\n\n\u201cThe way these products are designed is what gives rise to these opportunistic\nmurderers,\u201d says Matthew Bergman, founder of the Seattle-based Social Media\nVictims Law Center, who\u2019s representing Jordan\u2019s parents. \u201cThey are able to\nexploit adolescent psychology, and they leverage Meta\u2019s technology to do so.\u201d\n\nBergman also represents a family from Arizona whose 14-year-old son was\nblackmailed after sending nudes. And Guffey, the South Carolina lawmaker,\nfiled his own wrongful death case against Meta. A spokeswoman for Meta says\nthe company can\u2019t respond to questions about these cases because litigation is\npending.\n\nThe lawsuits face a significant hurdle: overcoming Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act. This liability shield has long protected social\nmedia platforms from being held accountable for content posted on their sites\nby third parties. If Bergman\u2019s product liability argument fails, Instagram\nwon\u2019t be held responsible for what the Ogoshi brothers said to Jordan DeMay.\n\nRegardless of the legal outcome, Jordan\u2019s parents want Meta to face the court\nof public opinion. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my story, it\u2019s his,\u201d John DeMay says. \u201cBut\nunfortunately, we are the chosen ones to tell it. And I am going to keep\ntelling it. When Mark Zuckerberg lays on his pillow at night, I guarantee he\nknows Jordan DeMay\u2019s name. And if he doesn\u2019t yet, he\u2019s gonna.\u201d\n\nPresque Isle Park, overlooking Lake Superior, where Kyla and Jordan would go\nto watch the sun set.
