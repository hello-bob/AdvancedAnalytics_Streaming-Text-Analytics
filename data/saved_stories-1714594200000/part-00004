However, the company gave a rather uninspiring guidance for Gaudi 3\nsales this year: the company expects Gaudi 3 to generate $500 million in\nrevenue in 2024. Compared to AI-related expectations of AMD and Nvidia, this\nlooks like a negligible sum.\n\n\"Our Gaudi 3 launch gave us a strong offering to improve our position in\naccelerated computing for the data center and cloud,\" said Pat Gelsinger,\nIntel's chief executive, at the earnings call last week. \"We now expect over\n$500 million in accelerated revenue in the second half of 2024 with increasing\nmomentum into 2025 based on Gaudi 3's vastly superior TCO as well as our own\nexpanding supply.\"\n\nAMD expects its Instinct MI300-series offerings to generate about $3.5 billion\nin revenue this year, which is a modest expectation compared to Nvidia, whose\ndata center GPU revenue \u2014 dominated by GPUs for AI and HPC applications \u2014 is\nexpected to hit around $40 billion this year. In fact, keeping in mind that\nNvidia is now focusing on shipping machines based on its Blackwell compute\nGPUs rather than individual processors, it is likely that Nvidia's data center\nrevenue will be significantly more than $47 billion in 2023.\n\nThere could be several reasons why Intel has such humble expectations for\nGaudi 3's business performance in 2024. Perhaps the company will start\nshipping Gaudi 3 in meaningful volumes only very late in the year and will not\nhave enough time to ship tens of thousands of processors for revenue in 2024.\nIt is also possible that Intel will be supply-constrained or that it expects\nsales of Gaudi 3 to take off slowly because customers yet have to tailor their\nAI software for Intel's hardware.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nBased on Intel's claims, the interest in Gaudi 3 is significant, so the\nproduct should be quite popular, which means that over time, it will generate\nmuch more than $0.5 billion for the company.\n\n\"At our Vision event, we had over 20 customers publicly describing their\nembrace of Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3,\" said David Zinsner, Intel's chief financial\nofficer, at the conference call. \"I was super pleased to see the breadth of\nthose customers. It was CSPs like Naver and Ola and IBM Cloud. It was ISVs\nlike Seekr, right, coming on board. But maybe most importantly, enterprise\ncustomers.\"\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

Most volume would be in 2025. So half a billion in\n2024 isn\u2019t bad for a product releasing near the end of the year. If anything,\nit indicates that 2025 would be much better considering it will have full 12\nmonths to sell it.\n\nReply\n\n  * Alvar \"Miles\" Udell\n\nIt's not that unexpected, remember:\n\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/rival-firm-says-nvidias-ai-\ncustomers-are-scared-to-be-seen-courting-other-ai-chipmakers-for-fear-of-\nretaliatory-shipment-delays-report\n\nReply\n\n  * JRStern\n\nIt's not Intel's fault that some of the hyperscalers are spending billions on\nNVDA chips simply to horde them.
