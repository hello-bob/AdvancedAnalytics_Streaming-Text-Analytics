Meet the 'toolbelt generation'\nWith demand for jobs like HVAC technicians, electricians and wind turbine\ninstallers, enrollment is ticking up at vocational schools as four-year\ncollege costs continue to soar.\n\n### National\n\n# Many in Gen Z ditch colleges for trade schools. Meet the 'toolbelt\ngeneration'\n\nApril 22, 20245:02 AM ET\n\nBy\n\nWindsor Johnston\n\nSy Kirby dreaded the thought of going to college after graduating from high\nschool. He says a four-year degree just wasn't in the cards for him or his\nbank account.\n\n\"I was facing a lot of pressure for a guy that knew for a fact that he wasn't\ngoing to college,\" Kirby says. \"I knew I wasn't going to sit in a classroom,\nespecially since I knew I wasn't going to pay for it.\"\n\nInstead, at the age of 19, Kirby took a job at a local water department in\nsouthern Arkansas. He said the position helped him to develop the skills that\nhelped him start his own construction company.\n\nSy Kirby, who runs his own construction company, says a four-year degree just\nwasn't in the cards for him or his bank account. Will Anderson hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nWill Anderson\n\nSy Kirby, who runs his own construction company, says a four-year degree just\nwasn't in the cards for him or his bank account.\n\nWill Anderson\n\nNow at age 32, Kirby finds himself mentoring many of his employees, who also\nopted to learn a skilled trade rather than shelling out tens of thousands of\ndollars to pursue a degree that they wouldn't use after graduating.\n\nKirby says blue-collar work is lucrative and allows him to \"call the shots\" in\nhis life. But, he says the job also comes with a downside, mainly because of\nthe stigma attached to the industry.\n\n\"I think there's a big problem with moms and dads coming home from quote-\nunquote 'dirty' jobs. Coming home with dirty clothes and sweating. You had a\nhard day's work and sometimes that's looked down upon,\" he says.\n\n### Education\n\n### High-paying jobs that don't need a college degree? Thousands of them sit\nempty\n\nKirby is among the growing number of young people who have chosen to swap\ncollege for vocational schools that offer paid, on-the-job training.\n\n### Skilled trades make a comeback\n\nLisa Countryman-Quiroz is the CEO of JVS, or Jewish Vocational Service, a\nnonprofit in San Francisco that provides career training for unemployed\nworkers to find jobs, including in skilled trades. She says that over the\nyears there has been a shift \u2014 with skilled trade making a comeback,\nespecially among members of Generation Z.\n\n\"Folks have really prioritized a college education as a path to the middle\nclass and a path to a cushy office job.\" But, Countryman-Quiroz says, \"over\nthe last 10 to 15 years, we are seeing a trend among young people opting out\nof universities. Just the crushing debt of college is becoming a barrier in\nand of itself.\"\n\nMore than half of Gen Zers say it's possible to get a well-paying job with\nonly a high school diploma, provided one acquires other skills. That's\naccording to a survey by New America, a Washington Think Tank that focuses on\na range of public policy issues, including technology, education and the\neconomy.\n\n### Business\n\n### The driver of the big rig one lane over might soon be one of these\nteenagers\n\n### The high cost of college prompts a change in career paths\n\nIn addition, the Education Data Initiative says the average cost of college in\nthe United States has more than doubled in the 21st century.\n\nWith that price tag increasing, many Gen Zers say they've been left with no\nchoice but to leave the college path. Many say living with their parents until\nthey can pay off their college debt isn't an option.\n\n### The Indicator from Planet Money\n\n### Do I need a four-year degree?\n\nNitzan Pelman is founder of Climb Hire, a company that helps low-income and\noverlooked people break into new careers. She says many young people say\ngraduating from college with a six-figure debt is a non-starter.\n\n\"It's not a secret that the cost of college has gone up so dramatically in the\nlast decade that it's really cost prohibitive at this point,\" she says.\n\nPelman says pursuing skilled trades can also help \"level the playing field,\"\nespecially for young people from less-privileged backgrounds and for people of\ncolor.\n\n### Economy\n\n### Construction boom helps fuel job gains in March\n\n\"We don't see a lot of Black men in construction, but more Latino men in\nconstruction and you don't see many women in construction. Social capital is a\nreally big gatekeeper and a door-opener for accessing high-quality jobs and\nhelping people break into certain industries,\" she says.\n\nIn 2021, President Biden signed a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure\nbill. Since then, he's been traveling the country promoting the law, which he\nsays will open up thousands of new jobs in trades.\n\n### Education\n\n### Comparing college costs to the amount a student expects to earn after\ngraduation\n\n### \"You can expect to get your hands dirty and that's OK\"\n\nThe high cost of college isn't the only factor driving many young people\ntoward skilled trades. With the use of artificial intelligence on the rise,\nmany Gen Zers see manual labor as less vulnerable to the emerging technology\nthan white-collar alternatives. They also say vocational schools are a\nstraight path to well-paying jobs.\n\nPelman says increasing salaries and new technologies in fields such as\nwelding, plumbing and machine tooling are giving trade professions a face-\nlift, making them more appealing to the younger crowd.\n\n\"There are a lot of vocational jobs out there that are pretty attractive \u2014\nHVAC repair and installation, electricians, solar panel installer \u2014 there's so\nmuch demand for wind turbine installers who, in many cases, make more than\n$100,000 a year \u2014 so there's a lot of demand for manual labor,\" she stresses.\n\nDiego Aguilar works at a trade center at East Bay Municipal Utility District\nin Oakland, Calif. Marla Aufmuth/JVS hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nMarla Aufmuth/JVS\n\nDiego Aguilar works at a trade center at East Bay Municipal Utility District\nin Oakland, Calif.\n\nMarla Aufmuth/JVS\n\nThat was the case for 25-year-old Diego Aguilar, who says a traditional desk\njob was out of the question for him. Aguilar now works full time at a trade\ncenter at East Bay Municipal Utility District in Oakland, Calif., after going\nthrough the JVS training program.\n\n\"When I went into a trade program I learned how much money I could make\nperforming a very specific kind of work. You need mechanics, you need\nmachinists, you need carpenters, operators you need painters. You can expect\nto get your hands dirty and that's OK,\" Aguilar says.\n\n### The Indicator from Planet Money\n\n### Jobs Friday: Why apprenticeships could make a comeback\n\nData from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center shows the number\nof students enrolled in vocational-focused community colleges increased 16%\nfrom 2022 to 2023.\n\nAs for Kirby, he says his mission is to keep raising awareness about what he\ncalls the \"toolbelt generation.\"\n\n\"Where they can walk out of the school of hard knocks, pick an industry, work\nyour 10 years, take your punches, take your licks and hopefully you're\nbringing jobs and careers back to the community,\" he says.\n\nWhen asked if he regrets his decision to go into skilled trades, Kirby\nchuckles. \"Not for a second,\" he says.\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n  * \u00a9 2024 npr\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 162 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
