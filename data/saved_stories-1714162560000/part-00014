The big news was that HashiCorp would be shifting from\npushing licenses and support contracts for its seven core and integrated\nproducts \u2013 Terraform, Packer, Waypoint, Nomad, Vault, Boundary, and Consul \u2013\nto a SaaS model where it operates these tools on various public clouds on\nbehalf of customers.\n\nAnd then on Tuesday, the rumors broke that IBM was going to acquire the\nupstart, whose Hashi Stack \u2013 now formally called HashiCorp Cloud Platform \u2013 is\nan alternative to the OpenStack cloud controller, OpenShift Kubernetes\ncontainer controller, and Ansible automation tool that are all brought\ntogether under IBM\u2019s Red Hat brand.\n\nBoth the Red Hat and Hashi stacks are based on open source tools, so it will\nbe hard to argue, on antitrust grounds, that IBM is cornering the market on\nenterprise distributed computing. But it clearly is trying to do that. And\nbuying HashiCorp is the best way to ensure that whichever stack enterprise\ncustomers choose and whatever cloud customers choose, Big Blue wins. (Don\u2019t\nget to used to the new HashiCorp Cloud Platform, or HCP for short, branding.\nThere is a very good chance it will all have the Red Hat brand slapped on it\nbefore too long.)\n\nIBM confirmed the HashiCorp rumors in its conference call on Wednesday to go\nover its first quarter of fiscal 2024 financial results ending in March. Big\nBlue is paying $35 a share to acquire HashiCorp, which is a 41.7 percent\npremium over the company\u2019s stock price before the acquisition rumors hit.\nHashiCorp which has $1.28 billion in the bank, yielding a net cost of around\n$6.4 billion when the deal gets done sometime before the end of the year if\nall goes according to plan. There is a non-zero chance that someone moves in\nto be a spoiler, but we don\u2019t think the odds are high. Oracle, Amazon,\nMicrosoft, Google, or Elon Musk could make a higher bid to make trouble. Heck,\nHock Tan, chief executive officer of Broadcom and relatively new owner of\nVMware, could swoop in with big bags of cash.\n\nWe did a deep dive into the Hashi Stack back in June 2021, before the company\nwent public and when HashiCorp co-founder and chief technology officer Armon\nDadgar threw a little bit of shade at Kubernetes and bragged that the Nomad\nalternative that HashiCorp had created was better. You can run Kubernetes atop\nthe Hashi Stack just like any other application you might imagine \u2013 which was\nalso the case with the Mesos controller out of Twitter and the OpenStack\ncontroller out of NASA and Rackspace Hosting \u2013 but the question is why would\nyou when Nomad is simpler and easier?\n\nWe analyzed HashiCorp\u2019s financials in March 2022 the wake of the company going\npublic in December 2021, noting that like many startups HashiCorp was spending\nmoney a lot faster than it was making it so it could get larger and reach\nbreakeven. The company\u2019s market capitalization peaked at $17.1 billion just\nafter it went public and was $5.6 billion when we were writing, when\nHashiCorp\u2019s four core automation products at the time \u2013 Terraform for\ninfrastructure provisioning, Vault for security, Consul for networking, and\nNomad for workloads and containers \u2013 had what the company figured was a $73\nbillion total addressable market.\n\nWhen we drilled down into HashiCorp\u2019s numbers again in March 2023, market\ncapitalization was stable at $5.3 billion, and the company said that it wanted\nto grow at 30 percent per year and be profitable on a quarterly basis sometime\nin the second half of fiscal 2025. It doesn\u2019t look like it will happen, with\nsales growth on an annual basis dropping by half in fiscal 2024 ended in\nJanuary this year, to 22.5 percent, from the 48.3 percent growth HashiCorp had\nin fiscal 2023.\n\nThe math we did back in March last year, based on the company\u2019s guidance, had\nHashiCorp breaking $1 billion in sales \u2013 and doing so profitably \u2013 in fiscal\n2026.\n\nIn September 2023, HashiCorp switched its code to the Business Source License,\nwhich allows people to see the code and make modifications, but absolutely\nrestricts someone from creating a clone of the Hashi Stack and peddling\nsupport for it. This created a lot of blowback from open source purists, but\nwith millions of lines of code created from the HashiCorp payroll, you can\nhardly blame a public company from trying to earn its keep. (There is a reason\nthat Mitchell Hashimoto, the other company co-founder and the one that gave it\na name, left HashiCorp in December 2023. Well, there are several.) HashiCorp\nwas literally trying to avoid the CentOS problem that has plagued Red Hat\u2019s\nenterprise business for decades.\n\nAnd so here we are. With the market cap down to $4.74 billion for HashiCorp\nearlier this week and growth stalled lower than expected in an ebullient cloud\nmarket but an IT world shaken up and distracted by generative AI, Big Blue\ncould make HashiCorp shareholders an offer that they wouldn\u2019t refuse. (It is\nnot quite an offer that they couldn\u2019t refuse, but it might be close.)\n\nBefore we get into IBM\u2019s numbers for the first quarter and how it looks like\nRed Hat, let\u2019s just get some visuals on HashiCorp\u2019s numbers.\n\nAs you can see below, getting new customers is getting harder, not easier, and\nwhile the big customers still keep coming, the pace has also slowed here:\n\nRevenue growth for support contracts hit an inflection point to a slower\ngrowth rate a year ago, and even though its cloud-hosted service offering is\ngrowing linearly, it is still growing a little bit more slowly than support.\nSoftware licensing revenues for stuff that is presumably closed source wiggles\nup and down here and there and is generally growing.\n\nProfessional services putter along, and this is where IBM can not only help,\nbut needs something new around which to wrap consulting services. IBM\u2019s stock\ntook a hit this week precisely because the forecast for its consulting\nbusiness is not great.\n\nHere is a comparison we did a year ago, and we just updated it, comparing Red\nHat and HashiCorp, linking them at the state of their businesses at their\nIPOs. The parallels are interesting, amusing, and not even remotely causal:\n\nHashiCorp is a bigger and stronger company before and after its IPO than Red\nHat was. In the summer of 1999 (which was in fiscal 2000 for Red Hat), when\nRed Hat made only made tens of millions of dollars a quarter, the company\u2019s\nmarket capitalization shot above $20 billion. (That was real irrational\nexuberance, eh?) In the wake of the Dot-Com Boom, it took until 2017 for Red\nHat to build a business that justified a $20 billion market capitalization and\nthus it could hit it again.\n\nSo how does HashiCorp fit into IBM? Pretty much like a smaller Red Hat, and\nvery likely within Red Hat when all is said and done. (Just like Red Hat\nabsorbed CoreOS Linux and its neat container tools for Kubernetes in 2018 to\ncreate the second and better iteration of its OpenShift container controller.)\n\nIBM certainly needs to ride any systems software wave it can find, and if\nthere are customers looking to use Hashi Stack instead of the OpenShift-\nOpenStack-Ansible combo to create hybrid clouds, then IBM needs to have\ncontrol of both.\n\nIBM is looking way out into the future with this deal, and it will not have a\nmaterial impact for a while on Big Blue\u2019s software business. The Red Hat\nbusiness has an annual run rate in the trailing twelve quarters of $6.7\nbillion and is 11.5X as large as HashiCorp. But it is only growing at 8\npercent or 9 percent per quarter, and when IBM bought it in October 2018 and\nmerged it into its Software group in 2019, it was growing at between 20\npercent and 25 percent year on year, depending on the quarter.\n\nRed Hat has nonetheless \u2013 and as we expected \u2013 bent the overall IBM core\nsystems business up and to the right, which it most certainly was not doing\nahead of the Red Hat acquisition. The systems part of the Red Hat business\nwere added to the core systems business \u2013 meaning servers, storage, and\noperating systems but not all middleware and no databases or application\nsoftware \u2013 in 2019, and you can see it stop the slide and reverse it.\n\nHashiCorp can do the same thing for Red Hat, initially at a smaller scale, and\nthus also help the overall \u201creal\u201d IBM systems business grow more than it might\notherwise. A 20 percent growth rate is a heck of a lot more than the 1.6\npercent growth rate IBM\u2019s core systems business had in the trailing twelve\nmonths. That said, IBM brought in $32 billion from the combination of its\nSystem z mainframe and Power Systems servers and their storage and operating\nsystems in the past four quarters, and of that, $4.7 billion was for systems\nsoftware from Red Hat for servers from IBM or from others who also use Red Hat\nsoftware.\n\n#### Sign up to our Newsletter\n\nFeaturing highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to\nyour inbox with nothing in between.
