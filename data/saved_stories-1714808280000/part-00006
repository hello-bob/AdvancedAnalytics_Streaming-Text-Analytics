LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters and memory\n> usage while achieving comparable performance to full fine-tuning. We aim to\n> assess the viability of training and serving LLMs fine-tuned with LoRA in\n> real-world applications. First, we measure the quality of LLMs fine-tuned\n> with quantized low rank adapters across 10 base models and 31 tasks for a\n> total of 310 models. We find that 4-bit LoRA fine-tuned models outperform\n> base models by 34 points and GPT-4 by 10 points on average. Second, we\n> investigate the most effective base models for fine-tuning and assess the\n> correlative and predictive capacities of task complexity heuristics in\n> forecasting the outcomes of fine-tuning. Finally, we evaluate the latency\n> and concurrency capabilities of LoRAX, an open-source Multi-LoRA inference\n> server that facilitates the deployment of multiple LoRA fine-tuned models on\n> a single GPU using shared base model weights and dynamic adapter loading.\n> LoRAX powers LoRA Land, a web application that hosts 25 LoRA fine-tuned\n> Mistral-7B LLMs on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80GB memory. LoRA Land\n> highlights the quality and cost-effectiveness of employing multiple\n> specialized LLMs over a single, general-purpose LLM.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2405.00732 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2405.00732v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Justin Zhao [view email] [v1] Mon, 29 Apr 2024 04:01:45 UTC (1,349 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled LoRA Land: 310 Fine-tuned LLMs that Rival\nGPT-4, A Technical Report, by Justin Zhao and 9 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2405\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
