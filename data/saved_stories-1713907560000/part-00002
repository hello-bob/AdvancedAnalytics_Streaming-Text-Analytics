This week, Tyler Burgese interviews\nsociology professor Erin A. Cech about her work on *passion jobs* \u2014 something\nanyone who\u2019s read my work knows I\u2019ve been thinking about for years. Enjoy, and\nif you have a spectacularly good idea for a future Culture Study interview,\nyou know where to find me (aka, my email: annehelenpetersen at gmail dot com)\n\nNow, here\u2019s Tyler:\n\nIf you do what you love, the saying goes, you\u2019ll never work a day in your\nlife.\n\n...I\u2019ll admit that I had a hard time typing that with a straight face. Was it\never that simple?! In reality, tying something you love doing directly to your\nfinancial stability is logistically and emotionally fraught, to say the least.\n\nWe Culture Study readers are in near-constant dialogue about the role of work\nin our lives, from LARPing your job to vocational awe, from quiet quitting to\nloud quitting, and what makes a job secure, or even just good. For this reason\nand many others, I\u2019m delighted to introduce this week\u2019s interview that will\nsurely add even more texture to these ongoing conversations.\n\nDr. Erin A. Cech is an associate professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s\ndepartments of Sociology and Mechanical Engineering (by courtesy) and has\npublished widely on social inequality in and out of the workplace,\nparticularly along the lines of class, gender, and sexuality. She visited my\nsociology department last fall to give talks on her two (!!) recently\npublished books, The Trouble with Passion: How Searching for Fulfillment at\nWork Fosters Inequality, which we\u2019ll focus on today, and Misconceiving Merit:\nParadoxes of Excellence and Devotion in Academic Science and Engineering,\ncoauthored with sociologist Mary Blair-Loy. As soon as I got home from campus\nthat day, I emailed Anne Helen suggesting Erin for an upcoming Culture Study\ninterview.\n\nIn The Trouble with Passion, Erin demonstrates how the commodification of\npassion in the contemporary workplace perpetuates class inequality in college\nand beyond. While passion may seem, on the surface, to be highly\nindividualistic, she details the many ways that it is actually rooted in\nstructural positions and identities. Her methods are robust and aspirational:\n170 interviews with career aspirants and counselors, four surveys of US\nworkers, a hiring experiment, and a review of career-based self-help\nliterature.\n\nI was surprised and delighted to be invited back to the Culture Study stage to\nconduct this interview myself! Our conversation spans the mechanisms of\nworkplace inequality, finding meaning outside of paid employment, and why we\nshould probably stop asking kids what they want to be when they grow up.\n\nYou can buy The Trouble with Passion here and find out more about Erin\u2019s work\nhere.\n\nTo help orient us in the world of this brilliant book, I present a short\nquestion with broad implications: why should we pay attention to whether or\nnot people are passionate about their work?\n\nIn the United States, and in many other postindustrial countries, who we are,\nand how others see us, is entwined with what we do for our paid employment.\nWhen children are asked that perennial question, \u201cwhat do you want to be when\nyou grow up?\u201d they are supposed to answer it with some kind of occupation,\nrather than a personal quality or a family or community goal.\n\nIn turn, the \u201cbest work\u201d is work that is fulfilling and self-expressive\u2014work\nthat feels like an extension of us.\n\nWith all its popularity across education level, class, race, and gender, I\nargue that this cultural priority of \u201cfollowing your passion\u201d turns out to be\nan important mechanisms perpetuating socioeconomic inequality among college-\ngoers, the college educated, and beyond.\n\nLet\u2019s do some table-setting. Can you tell us about the book\u2019s central\nanimating concept, the passion principle?\n\nThe passion principle is a cultural schema that elevates self-expression and\nfulfillment as the central factor in good career decision-making. It entails\nthe prioritization of personally fulfilling work\u2014sometimes even at the expense\nof job security or a decent salary. I find that over 70% of college-educated\nworkers in the US highly praise passion-related considerations in their\nnotions of good career decision-making, and almost two thirds rank its\nimportance above considerations like good salaries and job security. Adherence\nto the passion principle is surprisingly consistent across gender, race, and\nclass background.\n\nWhy is the passion principle compelling to so many people? Passion isn\u2019t just\nseen as a path to a good job, but as key to a good life. White-collar workers\nin the postindustrial labor force encounter a tension between demands on them\nto be devoted, overworking employees and desires to align with ubiquitous\ncultural expectations for self-expression. Passion-seeking seems to mitigate\nthis tension: it allows workers to incorporate their paid employment into\ntheir overarching narrative of the self, while promising to reduce the\npotential drudgery of long hours and work overload.\n\nAlthough passion-seeking is a goal for many workers regardless of class\nbackground or education, there are wide discrepancies in who is ultimately\nable to parlay their passion into stable, well-paid jobs. Globalization forces\nlike automation and outsourcing have meant that US workers without a college\ndegree are much less likely to have access to jobs with tasks that they might\nconceivably be passionate about.\n\nBut even with a college degree, working-class and first-generation college\ngraduates are more likely than their wealthier peers to end up in low-paying\nunskilled jobs when they pursue their passion. By contrast, well-off career\naspirants are more likely to have access to financial \u201csafety nets\u201d\u2014the\nfreedom to wait it out until a job in their passion comes along without\nworrying about defaulting on student loans, or to volunteer or take an unpaid\ninternship to get their foot in the door and trust that their family can help\nthem make ends meet. Economically advantaged career aspirants also have better\naccess to cultural and social capital \u201cspringboards,\u201d such as the use of\nparents\u2019 social networks to help them find jobs. Because they lack these same\nsafety nets and springboards, first-generation and working class passion-\nseekers, regardless of the type of training they have received, are more\nlikely than similarly trained peers to end up in precarious employment far\noutside of their passion.\n\nI also investigate whether employers prefer, benefit from, and maybe even\nexploit the passion of job applicants and employees. In one experiment, I\nfound that college-educated workers, even those who have hiring authority in\ntheir own jobs, prefer job applicants who express passion for the work, in\npart because they believe those applicants will be willing to put more\nuncompensated work into their jobs.\n\nIn these and other ways, I argue, the cultural priority of passion seeking\ncontributes to several dynamics of labor force inequality.\n\nThe Trouble with Passion also raises more existential questions about the\nprioritization of passion among career decision-makers. What does it mean to\ncenter paid employment in one\u2019s self-reflexive project? How does it perpetuate\na culture of overwork and close off other meaning-making opportunities? And in\nwhat ways might the popularity of the passion principle perpetuate\nexploitation \u2013 not only of workers\u2019 time, effort, and emotional labor, but of\nworkers\u2019 very senses of self?\n\nYou write about the ways that the passion principle has operated throughout\nyour own career\u2014including the belief that it caused you to leave behind a\ncareer in engineering to pursue your passion for sociology. Your research,\nhowever, seems to have demystified the passion principle for you, revealing\nthat passionate work is not a one-size-fits-all ticket to fulfillment in life.\nCan you tell us about how you confronted the biases you held about passion as\nthe findings for this project presented themselves to you?\n\nConducting research for The Trouble with Passion raised sobering questions for\nme about standard approaches to mentoring and career advising in\nacademia\u2014approaches that I had fully embraced. Before this book, I often told\nmy students to prioritize their passion above other considerations, and saw\npassion-based commitment to my discipline as the purest form of commitment.\nThe more I uncovered, the more it became apparent that the goal of finding\npassion-based work is presented as ideal for everyone but is feasible for only\na privileged few.\n\nAdditionally, before this research, I implicitly agreed with the idea that\nemployers should prioritize passionate employees and applicants. And I had my\nown share of service industry experience! (In high school and college, I\nworked as a telemarketer, a pizza server, and a clothing store cashier, and\nhanded out samples at Costco.) Yet, the cultural value of passion-based\nservice runs deep. Although my research focused on college-going and college\neducated workers, my broader investigation revealed that even workers who are\nin jobs they aren\u2019t passionate about may still be expected to pretend that\nthey are. A sandwich board I saw recently in front of a Starbucks read, \u201cOur\nPASSION is to serve YOU.\u201d Casual perusal of help wanted ads for service jobs\nlike front desk clerks shows that many workers are expected by employers to\nengage in their jobs as if they were passionate about them.\n\nThe potential for passion to be exploited\u2014either the passion of workers who\nhave it, or by expecting workers to perform it\u2014was a deep-cutting finding that\nled to my own reckoning with my perspectives about work. It forced me to think\ncritically about how my passion for my own work might have been a blinder to\nprocesses of inequality in higher education. I also had to come to terms with\nmy own overwork. I couldn\u2019t recommend that others rethink the amount of time\nthey let work occupy their time on days off without considering my own\ntendency to work nights and weekends. Even more than that, the research\ndemanded that I ask myself, \u201cwho would I be, what is my identity, outside my\nline of work?\u201d\n\nYou point out the significant ways that the passion principle fosters and\njustifies inequality and segregation in the workplace by shifting the focus of\na structural phenomenon to individual-level decisions and preferences, a\nprocess you call \u201cchoicewashing.\u201d\n\nWhat are some of the ways that you suggest educational institutions and their\nemployees (or any institutions, for that matter) can help to decenter passion\nand mitigate the inequality that it can enable?\n\nBy promoting passion-seeking as the most morally valuable way to make career\ndecisions, without addressing skyrocketing education costs, differential\naccess to employment opportunities, and unequal social and cultural capital\nfor garnering the skills and experiences necessary to succeed on the job\nmarket, academic institutions and the instructors and advisors therein simply\nperpetuate the socioeconomic inequalities that students entered college with.\nCollege instructors notoriously promote the idea that students should follow\ntheir passion and \u201cfigure out the employment stuff later.\u201d In my interviews\nwith career counselors and coaches, I found that the majority promoted\npassion-seeking when advising students, and some even explicitly discouraged\nstudents from prioritizing pragmatic factors like salary and job security over\nmeaningful work. Anecdotally, college admissions essays seem to also\nimplicitly or explicitly ask students to explain their academic major choices\nthrough the lens of passion.\n\nFurthermore, this choicewashing often means that patterns of gender, race, and\nclass segregation in higher education and beyond are brushed off as the benign\noutcome of individuals choosing to follow paths they are passionate about.\nThis helps scaffold beliefs like the meritocratic ideology and undermines the\nperceived need for institutional change.\n\nEducators, parents, and employers need to expand the options young adults and\ncareer aspirants see for the role of work in their lives. Passion-seeking\nshould not be a moralized expectation.\n\nSecond, we need to champion collective solutions to the problems of paid work.\nThe passion principle is ultimately an individual-level solution\u2014it helps\nindividual workers navigate the constraints of the labor force and avoid the\npotential drudgery of paid work. But it does nothing to address the factors\nthat make paid work feel like drudgery in the first place. Collective\nsolutions\u2014championing better work hours and working conditions, stronger\nbenefits, and less overwork\u2014would not only make paid work more manageable for\npassion-seekers but also make work better for workers who labor in jobs that\nhold little potential for the expression of passion.\n\nThird, the reason the passion principle is such a powerful force of inequality\nreproduction is because passion-seeking is so risky for many. At the\ninstitutional level, expanding the social safety nets for workers and reducing\nthe crushing burden of student loan debt would go a long way to make passion-\nseeking less risky.\n\nEven people who do work they are passionate about must still do so within a\ncapitalist framework that exploits their labor for profit. This brought to\nmind the well-trod idea (at least among a certain corner of progressives) that\nthere is no ethical consumption under capitalism. To extend this idea a bit,\ndo you think that there can be passionate production under capitalism?\n\nThis is a great question. The passion principle is understood as a good career\ndecision-making guide because people believe it will help them avoid the\ndrudgery of decades of work in a job they feel no connection to. To achieve\nthis, passion-seekers and passionate workers invest much of their own sense of\nidentity in their paid employment.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this is a boon for employers. In the job application\nexperiment I ran, passionate applicants were preferred over applicants who\nwere interested in applying for other reasons (e.g., they respected the\ncompany, they liked the job\u2019s location) and potential employers preferred\npassionate applicants *because* they believed passionate applicants would work\nharder in the job without expecting an increase in pay. In other words,\nemployers may knowingly exploit the passion of the people who work for them.\n\nSo the question becomes: Can there be passionate production within capitalist\nemployment that isn\u2019t exploitative? Exploitation doesn\u2019t just exist at the\nindividual level, where individual workers feel exploited in their own jobs.\nPeople who are passionate about their work may genuinely not feel exploited.\nYet, exploitation in the broader sense is about the reward workers in an\nemployment system receive compared to the value the owners and stakeholders of\ntheir owners receive for their labor. If employers benefit (and profit) from\nlabor that workers put in because they are passionate about their work,\nwithout compensating that labor, that is part of the exploitation of passion.\nIf that production is compensated with proportional rewards, then passionate\nproduction becomes less exploitative.\n\nYou write in the book\u2019s preface that you are \u201cuneasy\u201d telling students\ninterested in sociology to follow their passion and \u201cfigure out the employment\nstuff later,\u201d which many academics tend to do. As a sociology student myself,\nI\u2019m grateful that you are resisting giving advice that may no longer be\npractical! How do you approach these conversations instead and what do you\ntell students who come to you asking for career advice, in sociology or\nbeyond?\n\nI didn\u2019t start out intending to study passion. I was a \u201cfollow your passion\u201d\nenthusiast before this project and encouraged many students to \u201cdo what you\nlove\u201d (especially if that meant pursuing sociology).\n\nMy research for The Trouble with Passion raised jarring questions about my\ntypical approaches to career advising and mentoring. The passion principle was\nalmost tailor-made for wealthy and upper-middle-class young adults. The\npresumption that all students should and will sacrifice financial stability to\npursue their passion is borne out of the privilege of academics (including\nmyself) who were rewarded for, and secured gainful employment in, their\npassion. Many students, especially first generation and working class\nstudents, may not be so lucky.\n\nNow I encourage students, and anyone else at the crossroads of important\ncareer decisions, to marshal a more holistic set of considerations in their\ndecision-making. I start with the question, What do you want your relationship\nto paid work to be? What do you need from your work in addition to a paycheck?\nPredictable hours? Enjoyable colleagues? Benefits? A respectful boss?\n\nSecond, if decision-makers are set on following their passion, I encourage\nthem to demand the worth of their passion-inspired work. Are you being fairly\ncompensated for the additional passion-fueled efforts you put into your job?\nWe contribute to our own and others\u2019 exploitation if we buy into the idea that\npassion is its own form of compensation.\n\nEducators, mentors, parents, and career counselors need to be sources of\ncounter-perspectives for career aspirants making critical decisions. It is\nvital that we offer more critical viewpoints on this long-venerated decision-\nmaking priority.\n\nYour research participants saw meaningful work as more than just a measure of\nprofessional success\u2014it also formed the bedrock of what they saw to be a life\nworth living. One potential antidote you present to conflating one\u2019s identity\nwith the work they do is what you refer to as \u201cdiversifying your meaning-\nmaking portfolio.\u201d I think most people feel that they could be devoting more\ntime to their hobbies and communities (and anything else outside of paid\nemployment), but it can be hard to know how and where to begin this work. What\ndid this diversification process look like for you as you came to understand\nits necessity?\n\nBy \u201cdiversify your meaning-making portfolio,\u201d I mean finding places outside of\nschool and work to center our self-reflexive projects. It can look like\nstarting or reviving hobbies, engaging in community service, joining a civic\ntheatre, taking language lessons, and otherwise nurturing senses of identity\nand fulfillment that exist fully outside the realm of one\u2019s paid employment.\nIn my own case, I started painting (poorly) and dusted off a violin I played\nin high school. My partner is actively involved in the local improvisational\ncomedy scene in our city.\n\nOf course, making room for non-employment passions takes work\u2014it can involve\nnegotiating with employers, partners, and friends to value and make room for\nthese passion pursuits. We may need to be militant with ourselves at first to\nkeep feelings of guilt and perfectionism at bay. The more anchors to sources\nof fulfillment and identity we have outside of paid employment, the more\nprotected we are from the existential threat of putting all of our meaning-\nmaking eggs in the capitalist employment basket.\n\nWe should be asking: How can we shrink the footprint of paid employment in our\nlives? Work that can be neatly contained into predictable hours, that provides\nfreedom to engage in meaningful activities outside of work, and that allows\ntime for friends, family, and volunteer work may be equally if not more\ndesirable goals than passion-seeking.\n\nPassion-seeking not only means giving our time and energy to our employers,\nbut also a central part of ourselves. To put it bluntly, the capitalist labor\nforce was not designed to support us in our personal growth and sense of\nfulfillment; it was designed to increase profit and value for the owners and\nstakeholders of the places we work. By understanding the power of the passion\nprinciple, we can be better equipped to envision alternatives to it\u2014for our\norganizations, for our institutions, and for ourselves. \u25cf\n\nYou can buy The Trouble with Passion here and find out more about Erin\u2019s work\nhere.\n\nAbout the Interviewer: Tyler Burgese is a sociology PhD student who thinks and\nwrites about sexuality and social media.

As a sociology professor, I'm also guilty of\ntelling students to pursue their passion and let the rest take care of itself,\nlike there's some incredible magic that happens to sort it all out. Which, in\nretrospect, is very naive. But it sometimes makes me uneasy given that for a\nlot of my majors, 'pursuing their passion' means going into fields like social\nwork, which are so important, but also will burn them out in a matter of years\nall while they're being severely underpaid.This interview also makes me think\nabout the collapse of civic and community life in the United States. If we're\nbeing told that all our passion goes into work, then of course we don't have\ntime or energy to volunteer or hang out or, you know, join a bowling league.\nWe don't have time to make friends. We don't have time to talk to our\nneighbors. Another important piece of the how-capitalism-screws-us puzzle.\nIt's not, for some of us, that we're being forced to work longer hours and put\nmore of our energy into our work. It's that we WANT to, because we believe\nthat's what a good life is supposed to be.Expand full commentLike\n(57)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n17 replies\n\nMichele Pfannenstiel DVMVeterinary Medicine Through Int...Apr 21Liked by Anne\nHelen PetersenWell that blew my mind.
