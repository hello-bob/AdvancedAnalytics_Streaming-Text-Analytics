Hospital tests revealed that they\nwere anaemic, with evidence of parasites living inside their red blood cells.\n\n> ## \u201cClimate change is increasing the number of people around the world who\n> are devastated by environmentally-linked crises \u2013 floods, droughts, food\n> insecurity.

Scott Gordon, Head of Gavi\u2019s Malaria Vaccine Programme\n\nBecause the patient had recently been bitten by a tick, doctors initially\nsuspected that they might have a parasitic disease called babesiosis. However,\nfurther tests revealed the presence of Plasmodium falciparum \u2013 the deadliest\ntype of malaria parasite \u2013 even though the patient had not recently travelled\nabroad.\n\n### First US case in 20 years\n\nMalaria was once common in the US and many European countries, but the\ndraining of wetlands where mosquitoes breed, plus the use of insecticides,\nwindow screens, antimalarial drugs and improved diagnostics, led to its\ngradual elimination. Most countries in these regions were declared malaria-\nfree by the 1970s.\n\nIn the US, the Anophelesmosquitoes that carry malaria are still present and\naround 2,000 cases of malaria are detected in travellers returning from\ncountries where the disease is endemic each year. However, because these cases\nare relatively rare and tend to be swiftly detected and treated, onwards\ntransmission \u2013 through a mosquito biting an infected person, and then biting\nsomeone else \u2013 is rarer still.\n\nBefore last year, no such cases had been reported since 2003, and none had\nbeen reported in Maryland for more than 40 years. However, between May and\nOctober 2023, ten people were diagnosed with locally acquired malaria in\nFlorida, Texas, Arkansas and Maryland \u2013 including the patient described above.\n\n### Is climate change to blame?\n\nWhile it is too soon to know if such cases mark the start of a trend,\nscientists are increasingly predicting that malaria has the potential to\nrebound in countries or areas long declared malaria-free, including parts of\nthe US, because of climate change.\n\n> ## \"There is stuff happening that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily say is consistent\n> with the trend of malaria eradication, including in places where it has\n> historically been eradicated, such as locally acquired malaria in, for\n> example, Greece.\u201d\n>\n> ###### \u2013 Chris Murray, professor of climate change and health, London School\n> of Tropical Medicine at the MRC unit in the Gambia\n\n\"Climate change is increasing the number of people around the world who are\ndevastated by environmentally-linked crises \u2013 floods, droughts, food\ninsecurity. This dramatically increases their vulnerability to debilitating\ndiseases such as malaria,\" said W. Scott Gordon, Head of Gavi's Malaria\nVaccine Programme. \"And these threats fall hardest on those populations that\nare already most vulnerable \u2013 in societies and around the world.\"\n\nMalaria isn't the only disease that researchers and health professionals are\nworried about. Other vector-borne diseases (those transmitted by blood-sucking\narthropods) such as dengue, Zika, West Nile virus and chikungunya \u2013 are also\nexpected to expand their geographic distributions to more temperate regions\nfurther north or south because of warming temperatures and altered rainfall\npatterns.\n\n\"Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases [those transmitted from animals to humans]\nin particular, are climate-sensitive, because it [climate] impacts the life\nhistory, distribution and success of the hosts these things transmit from,\"\nsaid Chris Murray, a professor of climate change and health at the London\nSchool of Tropical Medicine at the MRC unit in the Gambia.\n\nIn its latest World Malaria Report, published in November 2023, the World\nHealth Organization warned that climate change had the potential to undermine\ngains in the global fight against the disease, particularly in vulnerable\nregions where disrupted access to antimalarial drugs, vaccines and other\npreventive measures such as insecticide-treated bed-nets, e.g. as a result of\nconflict or natural disasters, further increases the risk of malaria\noutbreaks.\n\nLonger summers and warmer winters could extend the breeding season for\nmosquitoes and enable more of them to survive and flourish, while stagnant\npools of water left by receding floods or in plastic containers used to store\nwater in temporary human settlements, make ideal breeding grounds. Warmer\ntemperatures also speed up the growth cycle of malaria parasites, increasing\ntheir numbers.\n\n### Malaria transmission is changing\n\nAlready, there are indications that things are changing: \"There is stuff\nhappening that you wouldn't necessarily say is consistent with the trend of\nmalaria eradication, including in places where it has historically been\neradicated, such as locally acquired malaria in, for example, Greece,\" said\nMurray. \"However, attributing individual events to climate change is\ndifficult, because there are other factors that can contribute, such as\nchanging [malaria] importation rates related to changing flows of people.\n\n\"The season of possible transmission in a lot of places is also increasing.\nParticularly in temperate areas, you've got a situation where local\ntransmission is only possible within a given season \u2013 typically summer in\nEurope or the US. And what looks to be happening, at least from a theoretical\nperspective, is that the season is expanding.\"\n\n#### Have you read?\n\n  * \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of witnessing despair\u201d: relief and hope greet Benin\u2019s malaria vaccine roll-out\n  * Ghana sees falling malaria burden, targets elimination\n  * Malawi health workers report drop in malaria cases following vaccine intro\n\nSome of the strongest evidence for a link between climate change and malaria\ntransmission comes from long-term observations of cases in African highland\nareas on the fringes of endemic transmission, the WHO report said. These\nsuggest that rising temperatures have led to the expansion of the disease in\nrecent decades.\n\nExtreme rainfall and flooding in Pakistan during 2022 also resulted in a\nfivefold increase in malaria cases compared with 2021, the report noted, and\nsuch extreme weather events are predicted to become more commonplace due to\nclimate change.\n\n### Some regions could see a fall in cases\n\nHowever, it is not all bad news. Some areas where malaria is currently endemic\ncould experience a decrease in malaria because of changing temperatures.\n\nProf Jane Carlton, Director of the Malaria Research Institute at the Johns\nHopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said: \"An interesting fact about\nmalaria is that the parasite itself can only develop in a mosquito over quite\na tight temperature range: if it is too cold, the parasite won't grow, and if\nit is too hot, the parasite won't grow. This means that if it gets too hot in\na particular area, the parasite will die, and you may get fewer malaria cases.\n\n> ## \u201cAn interesting fact about malaria is that the parasite itself can only\n> develop in a mosquito over quite a tight temperature range: if it is too\n> cold, the parasite won\u2019t grow, and if it is too hot, the parasite won\u2019t\n> grow.

So, we might see a geographical change\nin the distribution of malaria, which is concerning.\"\n\nWhether such factors contributed to the flurry of locally acquired malaria\ncases in the US last year is impossible to say for sure. Seven of these cases\noccurred in Sarasota County, Florida, south of Tampa; one occurred in Texas,\njust north of the border with Mexico; and another occurred near Little Rock,\nArkansas. Unlike the Maryland case, these ones involved Plasmodium vivax, the\ndominant malaria parasite outside sub-Saharan Africa. All of the patients\nrecovered, and there is no evidence to suggest that any of the cases were\nrelated, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.\n\n\"If there are more [locally acquired] cases this year, then that will\ncertainly be something to be more aware of,\" said Carlton. \"But I think what\nthese cases have really triggered is a realisation that we need to do more\nstudies to better understand the local mosquito populations.\"\n\n### Italian studies\n\nSuch studies are already taking place elsewhere. For instance, in Italy, where\nmalaria was endemic until the 1970s, a cluster of seven non-imported, and\nseemingly unrelated, cases of malaria occurred in 2017, including one case of\nP. falciparum malaria in which a four-year-old girl died. A later\ninvestigation suggested she might have caught it during a hospital stay, as\nthe malaria strain was the same as one infecting another family at the\nhospital who had caught it during a recent trip to Burkina Faso. Possibly, the\nreuse of a needle or some other human error resulted in the girl becoming\ninfected, investigators said.\n\n> ## \u201cHumans are a critical element in the transmission cycle of malaria and\n> many other vector-borne diseases.

Scott Gordon, Head of Gavi\u2019s Malaria Vaccine Programme\n\nIncreased surveillance in the wake of these cases has detected mosquito\nspecies capable of carrying malaria parasites in several regions of Italy,\nincluding rice fields in northern regions, while a study published in\nParasites and Vectors earlier this month found Anopheles sacharovi mosquitoes\n\u2013 historically, one of the two key malaria vectors in Italy, and which were\nthought to have disappeared from the country more than 50 years ago \u2013 in the\nsouthern Apulia region.\n\nAlthough the density of these mosquitoes is unlikely to pose a health threat\nat the current time, \"to prevent the risk of reintroduction of the disease,\nthe need to strengthen the surveillance of [Anopheles mosquitoes] throughout\nthe South should be considered,\" the study authors said.\n\nEven though the risk of catching malaria in temperate regions remains very low\nat the current time, \"it is important that we have systems in place that we\ncan detect unusual changes in the distribution or the abundance of [disease-\ncarrying] species,\" said Murray.\n\nAlso needed is greater public awareness of the signs and symptoms of malaria\nand other vector-borne diseases in countries where they are not currently\nwidespread. \"It is important to start to inform populations in the US about\nhow to protect themselves during the summer months, such as by wearing long-\nsleeved shirts, and just being more aware of if they are being bitten,\"\nCarlton said.\n\n### Focus on the most vulnerable countries\n\nYet it is important not to lose sight of the huge gains that have been made\nagainst malaria in recent decades, and to recognise that the bulk of\ntransmission still occurs in low-income countries. Continuing to focus\nprevention and surveillance efforts on these countries is crucial, as health\ndisparities only magnify global and regional socio-economic disparities,\nleaving populations even more vulnerable to the impact of climate-related\ndisasters and other crises.\n\nT he biggest threat to the progress that has been made against malaria is the\ndisruption of public health systems, whether because of civil strife, poverty\nor climate-related disaster. \"That's when you start to get an increase in\nmalaria cases,\" Carlton said.\n\nOur global climate is changing. The best way to protect ourselves against\nmalaria is to shore up those health care systems to ensure that everyone stays\nsafe. \"Humans are a critical element in the transmission cycle of malaria and\nmany other vector-borne diseases. If we can ensure better care for our most\nvulnerable populations \u2013 such as making sure that they are vaccinated,\nproperly nourished and have access to prevention such as bed-nets \u2013 we may be\nable to limit some of the most dramatic impacts from the changing climate,\"\nsaid Gordon.\n\n## More from Linda Geddes\n\nView all\n\n## Could malaria stage a comeback in the US, Europe and elsewhere because of\nclimate change?\n\n24 Apr 2024\n\n9 min read\n\nMalariaClimate change\n\n## New rapid diagnostic tests will bolster cholera surveillance and improve\nvaccination campaigns\n\n5 Apr 2024\n\n3 min read\n\nCholeraVaccine campaignsVideos\n\n## How the next wave of vaccines could target human parasites\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\n14 min read\n\nVaccine development\n\n## Five things you need to know about the world\u2019s latest weapon against\nbacterial meningitis\n\n25 Mar 2024\n\n6 min read\n\nMeningitisVaccine development\n\n## Recommended for you\n\n## The malaria vaccine: A VaccinesWork guide\n\n25 Apr 2024\n\n1 min read\n\n## Fifty Years of Immunization Success Call for 50 More\n\n25 Apr 2024\n\n4 min read\n\n## Rotavirus vaccination slows down a major childhood killer in Pakistan\n\n25 Apr 2024\n\n5 min read\n\n## Malaria experts call for action on growing drug resistance in Africa\n\n25 Apr 2024\n\n4 min read\n\n## New data shows vaccines have saved 154 million lives in the past 50 years\n\n24 Apr 2024\n\n3 min read\n\n## Could malaria stage a comeback in the US, Europe and elsewhere because of\nclimate change?\n\n24 Apr 2024\n\n9 min read\n\n###### Get the latest VaccinesWork news, direct to your inbox\n\nSign up to receive our top stories and key topics related to vaccination,\nincluding those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u00a9 VaccinesWork.
