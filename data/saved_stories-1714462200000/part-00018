Microsoft Already Has\n\nWhile both Alphabet and Microsoft boasted strong quarterly earnings, only one\ntech giant showed that its generative AI bet is starting to pay off.\n\nIllustration: luchezar/Getty Images\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai is confident that Google will find a way to make\nmoney selling access to generative AI tools. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says\nhis company is already doing it.\n\nBoth companies reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit on\nThursday. And the stock prices of both soared on the results, with Alphabet\nfurther buoyed by its new plans to buy back more shares and issue its first-\never dividend.\n\nBut the near-term fortunes of Microsoft and Google, at least as far as their\ngenerative AI efforts are concerned, look different under the hood and in the\ncomments of their executives. How investors, workers, and potential customers\nperceive the rivals\u2019 dueling efforts could determine which gets the better\nchunk of the hundreds of billions of dollars in spending expected to flow to\nsuch software in the coming years.\n\nIn a call with financial analysts on Thursday, Nadella touted that Microsoft\nnow has 1.8 million customers for GitHub Copilot, a generative AI tool that\nhelps engineers write software code. That\u2019s up from 1.3 million customers a\nquarter ago.\n\nAmong Fortune 500 companies, 60 percent are using Copilot for Microsoft Office\n365, a virtual assistant that uses generative AI to help workers write emails\nand documents, and 65 percent are using a Microsoft Azure Cloud service that\nenables them to access generative AI software from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\u201cAzure has become a port of call for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI\nproject,\u201d Nadella said. The $13 billion dollars Microsoft has invested in\nOpenAI has certainly helped win those clients.\n\nThe buzz of interest in AI services helped drive revenue for Microsoft\u2019s\nbiggest unit, cloud services\u2014up by 7 percentage points compared to a year\nago\u2014and Microsoft\u2019s overall sales rose 17 percent to nearly $62 billion. It\nalso gained cloud market share, Nadella added. The number of $100 million\ncloud deals that Microsoft landed increased 80 percent during the quarter\ncompared to the same period a year ago, and $10 million deals doubled.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Pichai had milestones to boast about too. He told analysts in a\nseparate call that more than 1 million developers are using Google Cloud\u2019s\ngenerative AI tools and that 60 percent of generative AI startups backed by\ninvestors are Google Cloud customers. Generative AI is also boosting the ad\ncampaigns of Google\u2019s advertising clients.\n\nBut Pichai didn\u2019t say how many signups Google had drawn to Gemini Advanced, a\n$20 per month subscription plan announced in February that provides access to\nthe company\u2019s most advanced AI chatbot.\n\nOn Google\u2019s core business of search, Pichai didn\u2019t share revenue figures\nrelated to experiments to summarize query results using generative AI. By\nproviding more direct answers to searchers, Google could end up with fewer\nopportunities to show search ads if people spend less time doing additional,\nmore refined searches. The types of ads Google does show also could have to\nshift.\n\nWhile Pichai said the tests show that users exposed to generative-AI-powered\nsearch are doing more searches, they are also potentially less profitable for\nGoogle because the underlying technology to power more advanced searchers is\ncostlier than operating its longstanding systems.\n\nPichai expressed little concern on either front. \u201cWe are very, very confident\nwe can manage the cost of how to serve these queries,\u201d he said. \u201cI am\ncomfortable and confident that we\u2019ll be able to manage the monetization\ntransition here as well. It will play out over time.\u201d\n\nAlphabet\u2019s overall sales rose 15 percent to nearly $81 billion.\n\nIt spent about the same amount\u2014around $12 billion\u2014as Microsoft investing in\ninfrastructure like servers and data centers last quarter. But the results and\ncomments on Thursday suggest that Microsoft is further along in delivering a\npayoff.\n\nFor now, shareholders are giving both companies leeway. At the close of\nThursday, Microsoft shares were up 35 percent over the past year, and Alphabet\n51 percent over the past year. They are both at or near all-time highs. But if\ncustomers keep flocking to Copilot and the prospects for Gemini and Google\nsearch don\u2019t grow more clear, the trend lines soon could diverge.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Mysterious \u2018Dark\u2019 Energy That Permeates the Universe Is Slowly Eroding\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Gear\n\nI Tried These AI-Based Productivity Tools.
