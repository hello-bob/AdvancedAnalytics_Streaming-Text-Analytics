He\u2019s become so big that\nsponsors can no longer afford placement in his videos because his reach has\ngone so wide. His videos often get more viewers then major sporting events\nlike the Super Bowl.\n\nWhich makes me think what would the hypothetical valuation be of a $BEAST\ntoken and why would he even want to launch one in the first place?\n\nFirstly, if Mr Beast launched a token he could bootstrap his community to\nbuild out and accelerate the growth of both his chocolate company Feastables\nand his network of YouTube channels.\n\nAs of today Mr Beast could create a /mrbeast channel on warpcast.com and\nreward community contributors who create clips, memes, art and other content\nabout his brand in the form of the $BEAST token. This can currently be done\nthrough rounds.wtf which is public infrastructure built by Nouns DAO that\nenables communities to create and fund rounds with any token they like which\nis then distributed to participants with the most engagement.\n\nTake a look at what the Nouns community is currently rewarding animators who\ncreate any form of nounish animation during the week.\n\nAbove you can see that Nouns have created a 3 ETH (~$10,000) rewards pool for\nanyone who posts in the /nouns-animators channel. At the end of the timer the\nrewards pool is equally split in perpetuity with who was able to get the most\nengagement on their post.\n\nYou could easily see how Mr Beast might apply something similar to a channel\nlike /beast-clips or /beast-reactions where he could offer weekly reward pools\nfor people who clip his content and share it on social media or record their\nown reactions to his content, only further propagating his brand.\n\nMost streamers and content creators are already incentivising their community\nto create short form content from their libraries, because they understand the\nimmense power of community content to sky rocket their attention.\n\nCheck out a clip below from one of the biggest streamers in the world\nexplaining his \u2018genius marketing strategy\u2019.\n\nPlay Video\n\nAs explained in the video you just watched, Neon has a discord channel where\nhe pays clippers a certain rate per 100k views they get on platforms like\nTikTok and Instagram using his content. If he were to use something like\nrounds.wtf he could cut 90% of the work out and not have to manually send\npayments to his clipping community.\n\nKeep in mind the reach that Mr Beast or Neon has on platforms like YouTube or\nTikTok is nowhere near what they would have on a relatively small platform\nlike Warpcast. However, I\u2019m only using these examples as a demonstration of\nwhat could be built on the blockchain and decentralised social protocols like\nFarcaster.\n\nMrBeast could even create his own platform like theta.tv and reward his most\nloyal viewers with $BEAST per minute of content consumed. The latest zero\nknowledge proofs could also allow for the prevention of bots farming views on\nhis content by being able to privately prove human identity on chain.\n\nNow why would anyone even want the $BEAST token apart from immediately selling\nit?\n\nWell, you might be able to\n\n-Enter an onchain raffle to get in one of his videos\n\n-Buy merchandise directly on his store\n\n-Randomly get airdropped a Lamborghini if he\u2019s feeling kind\n\n-Join token gated streams and watch private videos\n\n-Stake your $BEAST to earn a portion of the Feastables profit\n\nThe list goes on...\n\nNow, none of these ideas are in any way perfect but it\u2019s an interesting\nalternative to the ad based model that web2 social has been built on. The\ntoken / paid model may just well be our answer to the annoying world of ads on\nsocial media.\n\nIf you liked this article feel free to forward it to anyone in MrBeast\u2019s team.\nWould love to introduce them to some of the best builders in web3.\n\nCollect this post to permanently own it.\n\nSubscribe to TEJI and never miss a post.\n\n#web3#social#community#cryptocurrency\n\n### What's your email?\n\nSubscribe to never miss a post.\n\nOver 100 subscribers\n\nNo thanks\n\nFarcaster\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nGitHub\n\nRSS\n\n\u00a9 2024 TEJI\n\n### TEJI\n\nWeekly thoughts on art, tech, business and life\n\nNo thanks\n\n### TEJI\n\nWeekly thoughts on art, tech, business and life\n\nNo thanks\n\n", "frontpage": false}
