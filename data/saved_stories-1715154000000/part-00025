We\u2019ve made\nit possible to create custom algorithms, introduced community-driven\nmoderation, and opened up federation. This has laid the foundation for a\nsocial protocol that can exist long after Bluesky the app does.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming next? Over the next few months, we\u2019ll be putting more of our\nenergy into the application. This includes a lot of \u201cQuality of Life\u201d\nimprovements and some long-requested features. The biggest changes will be:\n\n  * DMs\n  * Video\n  * Improved Custom Feeds\n  * Improved anti-harassment features\n  * OAuth\n\nWe\u2019re very excited to deliver these features you\u2019ve been asking for. We don\u2019t\nhave exact timelines, but you can expect to see all of these in the next few\nmonths.\n\n## DMs (direct messages)\n\nHistorically, all bluesky posts have been public. But there\u2019s a world of\ninteractions that are opened up when users can directly message each other.\nMaking personal connections, finding job opportunities, organizing events,\nworkshopping posts \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of reasons to slide into the DMs.\n\nWe\u2019re currently working on a DM service that will integrate into the Bluesky\napp. This service will be \u201coff protocol\u201d at first so we can develop\niteratively. We\u2019ll use what we learn to land protocol-driven DMs in the\nfuture. For an update on what\u2019s next for the protocol, see our protocol\nroadmap.\n\nThe v1 of DMs will be one-to-one. You\u2019ll be able to restrict who can DM you\n(open, followed users only, and disabled). If you\u2019ve used DMs on other social\nnetworks, it should feel familiar.\n\n## Video\n\nOur devs keep getting told about cute animal videos which our users can\u2019t\nshare. The guilt is terrible.\n\nWe\u2019re still finalizing the details, but it\u2019s looking like the v1 of video\nintegration on Bluesky will be 90-second clips that you can share on your\nposts.\n\n## Improved Custom Feeds\n\n\u201cCustom Feeds\u201d are one of the best features of Bluesky, allowing users to\ncompletely customize their timeline, but they\u2019re still pretty tough to work\nwith. Our community has done an incredible job filling in the gaps, but we\nwant to finally invest some more energy into making Feeds better.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of ideas in the works:\n\n  * In-app feed creation.\n  * The ability to submit posts to feeds, curate the submissions, and manually moderate what\u2019s included.\n  * Better feed discovery, and a way to see trending feeds.\n  * New feedback mechanisms which the algorithmic feeds can request, such as \u201cshow more\u201d and \u201cshow less\u201d buttons, and a way to track which posts have been seen to stop duplicates from showing so often.\n  * The ability to move \u201cFollowing\u201d out of the leftmost tab of your homepage.\n  * Feed \u201cfollowing\u201d to drive superfeeds which show what\u2019s happening in each of your communities.\n  * Better caching strategies to improve performance.\n\nAlgorithmic choice has been a key goal of Bluesky from the start, and we can\u2019t\nwait to move Custom Feeds forward. It\u2019s incredible how much our community has\ndone with them already, and we think a little extra love will enable you to go\neven further.\n\nWhat you see on social media is mostly determined by algorithms, and giving\nyou the power to control your algorithms like this is one of the most\nimportant things we do.\n\n## Improved Anti-harassment Features\n\nPublic social networks unfortunately all have to deal with the problem of\nusers who want to troll, harass, and just make other people\u2019s lives miserable.\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve implemented tooling like reply controls for threads,\nuser lists, and community-driven moderation through labeling, but there is\nstill more work to be done.\n\nIn the months to come, we\u2019ll be doing another pass over moderation tooling,\nwith a focus on anti-harassment mechanisms. We\u2019ll be publishing more on this\nsoon.\n\n## OAuth\n\nYou know those \u201cLog in with Facebook\u201d or \u201cLog in with Google\u201d buttons you see\nin apps? What if there was a \u201cLog in with Bluesky\u201d button? We think there\nshould be! OAuth is the internet standard that makes that possible, and we\u2019re\nbringing it to Bluesky and atproto.\n\nOAuth is especially important for third-party clients \u2013 it\u2019ll make signing in\neasier and safer for users. You never share your password with other clients,\nand \u201cApp Passwords\u201d will no longer be required.\n\nOnce OAuth lands, we\u2019ll expand on our 2FA model to enable more factors than\nemail (which landed last week).\n\nYou can read about our technical design here.\n\n## See you on Bluesky!\n\nIf you haven't tried Bluesky yet, sign up here and give it a spin.
