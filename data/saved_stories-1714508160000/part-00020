Under the guidelines, even\nthe tiniest Wi-Fi board must either have a randomized password or else\ngenerate a password upon initialization (through a smartphone app or other\nmeans). This password can't be incremental (\"password1,\" \"password54\"), and it\ncan't be \"related in an obvious way to public information,\" such as MAC\naddresses or Wi-Fi network names. A device should be sufficiently strong\nagainst brute-force access attacks, including credential stuffing, and should\nhave a \"simple mechanism\" for changing the password.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's more, and it's just as head-noddingly obvious. Software components,\nwhere reasonable, \"should be securely updateable,\" should actually check for\nupdates, and should update either automatically or in a way \"simple for the\nuser to apply.\" Perhaps most importantly, device owners can report security\nissues and expect to hear back about how that report is being handled.\n\nViolations of the new device laws can result in fines up to 10 million pounds\n(roughly $12.5 million) or 4 percent of related worldwide revenue, whichever\nis higher.\n\nBesides giving consumers better devices, these regulations are aimed squarely\nat malware like Mirai, which can conscript devices like routers, cable modems,\nand DVRs into armies capable of performing distributed denial-of-service\nattacks (DDoS) on various targets.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nThe Cyber Trust Mark is a voluntary IoT label coming in 2024. What does it\nmean?\n\nAs noted by The Record, the European Union's Cyber Resilience Act has been\nshaped but not yet passed and enforced, and even if it does pass, would not\ntake effect until 2027. In the US, there is the Cyber Trust Mark, which would\nat least give customers the choice of buying decently secured or genially\nabandoned devices. But the particulars of that label are under debate and\nseemingly a ways from implementation. At the federal level, a 2020 bill tasked\nthe National Institutes of Standard and Technology with applying related\nstandards to connected devices deployed by the feds.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n52\n\nKevin Purdy Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a\nvariety of technology topics and reviewing products.
