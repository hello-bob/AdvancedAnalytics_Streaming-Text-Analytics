It operates as a middle layer between data, AI\ninfrastructure, and large language models (LLMs), ensuring that end-users can\nharness the power of AI without compromising data security or compliance.\n\nThis software is easily configurable and works within existing data\ninfrastructure, minimizing the risk of data exposure. AI Infrastructure\nSoftware maintains sensitive information\u2019s confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability by enforcing strict authentication, authorization, and encryption\nprotocols. It enables organizations to leverage AI\u2019s potential while adhering\nto regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2, providing peace of\nmind to the organization and its users.\n\n## Bring the AI to the Data.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Infrastructure Software takes a novel approach to AI\ndeployment. Instead of centralizing data into a single repository, such as a\nvector database, it brings the AI directly to the data. This method ensures\nthat data remains secure within its original systems, as the AI only accesses\nthe necessary information when required.\n\nBy orchestrating data on-demand, AI Infrastructure Software maintains a high\nlevel of security and compliance while still enabling powerful AI\napplications. This approach minimizes data movement, reduces potential\nvulnerabilities, and allows organizations to leverage their existing data\ninfrastructure without compromising security or performance.\n\nAI Infrastructure Software is rapidly transforming the modern enterprise by\nbringing the AI to the data instead of the data to the AI. This equates to AI\nuse cases that support seventy-five percent (75%) of the workforce and the X\nfactor for delivering a return on investment.\n\n## Lessons learned from the first year of AI in the enterprise.\n\nOn PI Day, or March 14, 2023, to be exact, a day that also celebrates Albert\nEinstein\u2019s birthday, ChatGPT 4 was announced. Astute businesses and executives\nquickly realized that ChatGPT could unlock levels of productivity never seen\nbefore inside their company. The simplicity of ChatGPT\u2014ask it a question, and\nit knows what you mean\u2014would be the key to unlocking corporate intelligence\nand rapidly transforming data literacy.\n\nHowever, it quickly proved harder to deploy in the enterprise because of the\nprivate and secure nature of company data. Moreover, concerns of cloud vendor\nLLMs with internal data becoming compromised had companies securing their own\ninternal versions of LLMs, like OpenAI. Most organizations already follow an\n\u201cAI Inside\u201d policy to mitigate risks.\n\n## Grounding AI with your Company FACTs.\n\nThe enterprise also quickly realized that retrieval augmented generation is\nthe best technique for combining Generative AI with relevant company\ninformation for accurate and context-aware responses.\n\nUsing RAG to access and interact with company information and having AI-\npowered chatbots provide answers has become the prevailing initial use case in\nthe enterprise, with more sophisticated companies creating AI agents\nleveraging existing data systems.\n\n## AI Infrastructure Software: becoming the standard.\n\nAs companies start to develop their AI ecosystem, they often face a common\nchallenge. Tapping into information scattered across various data repositories\nand silos. From structured databases to communication platforms, these silos\nhold valuable information that can further improve Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG). However, early adopters quickly realized that unlocking\nthese data sources would require a new approach to enable AI in the\nenterprise.\n\nA set of guiding principles emerged to address these challenges, shaping the\nfoundation of AI Infrastructure Software. The first and most crucial tenet is\n\u201cbring the AI to the data, not the data to the AI,\u201d emphasizing the importance\nof leveraging existing data repositories without the need for costly and time-\nconsuming data migration.\n\nThe second guideline states, \u201cIf your people can\u2019t find the source of\ninformation, don\u2019t expect the AI to be any better,\u201d highlighting the\nsignificance of proper data management and accessibility.\n\nFinally, the third guideline extends the concept of zero trust security to AI,\ntreating all users, data, AI agents, and AI co-pilots equally and assuming\nthat no entity can be trusted until proven otherwise.\n\n## SWIRL AI Connect\n\nSolutions like SWIRL AI Connect echo the principles of AI Infrastructure\nSoftware, enabling the modern enterprise to offer intelligent applications to\nunlock their workforce.\n\nBy enabling intelligent applications that unlock the workforce\u2019s potential,\nSWIRL AI Connect empowers modern enterprises to harness the power of AI while\nmaintaining data security and compliance.\n\nOne of SWIRL AI Connect\u2019s key features is its ability to bring AI to the data\nrather than the other way around. By enabling Generative AI to connect\ndirectly with source systems, SWIRL AI Connect eliminates the need for data\nmigration, ensuring that data remains secure and compliant within its original\nenvironment.\n\nThis approach streamlines the AI deployment process and reduces the risk of\ndata breaches and unauthorized access.\n\n  * Data stays in place: SWIRL AI Connect enables Generative AI to connect with source systems, bringing the AI to the data.\n\n  * Unified search: SWIRL AI Connect supports searching multiple data and content repositories simultaneously.\n\n  * Adopts existing security: SWIRL AI Connect utilizes the source system security policies following a zero-trust security approach to ensure users access only what they\u2019re allowed.\n\n  * AI flexibility: SWIRL AI Connect supports using multiple LLMs and AIs, including company-created models located behind the firewall.\n\n  * Data flexibility: SWIRL AI Connect supports structured data from databases, as well as content from email and office documents and applications of collaboration like Teams and Slack.\n\n  * Pilot to co-pilot: SWIRL AI Connect enables simultaneous communication with several co-pilots simultaneously.\n\nAs the enterprise AI landscape continues to evolve, it is clear that AI\nInfrastructure Software will play a crucial role in shaping the future of the\nmodern enterprise. AI Infrastructure Software, like SWIRL AI Connect, can\nharness AI\u2019s power without compromising data security, compliance, or existing\nsystems.\n\nBy bringing AI to the data and providing a flexible, scalable platform for AI\ndeployment, solutions like SWIRL AI Connect enable organizations to unlock\ntheir workforce\u2019s full potential and drive unprecedented levels of\nproductivity and innovation.\n\nSWIRL is advanced AI infrastructure software that serves as a crucial link for\nthe enterprise, enabling seamless integration between various data sources,\ngenerative AI technologies, and applications while prioritizing security.\n\n###### Product\n\n  * SWIRL AI Connect\n  * SWIRL Unified Search\n  * Documentation\n\n###### Resources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Connectors\n  * GitHub\n  * Releases\n  * Slack\n  * News\n\n###### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Careers\n  * FAQ\n  * Partners\n\n###### Contact Us\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Locate Us\n\n\u00a9 SWIRL.
