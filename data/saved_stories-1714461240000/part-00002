Previously, it was only known in general\nterms that he was buried within the academy.\n\nIn a presentation of the research findings at the National Library of Naples,\nProf Graziano Ranocchia, of the University of Pisa, who spearheaded the team\nresponsible for unearthing the carbonised scroll, described the discovery as\nan \u201cextraordinary outcome that enriches our understanding of ancient history\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThanks to the most advanced imaging diagnostic techniques, we are\nfinally able to read and decipher new sections of texts that previously seemed\ninaccessible.\u201d\n\nThe scroll recorded the burial place of Plato as his designated garden at the\nAcademy of Athens.
