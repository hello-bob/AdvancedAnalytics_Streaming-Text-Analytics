A decision in the multi-year legal battle is expected in late summer\nor early fall.\n\nGoogle has contended that consumers still have plenty of choices for search\nengines, and that they choose Google search because it\u2019s helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the DOJ\u2019s perspective, however, it appears that iPhone users don\u2019t have\nmuch of a choice. While Apple has pushed back against Google and attempted to\nexplore partnerships with other search engines such as DuckDuckGo, its\nagreement with Google has effectively barred relationships with Google\ncompetitors.\n\nGoogle has similarly strict agreements with other device makers and web\nbrowsers such as Samsung and Mozilla. The company reportedly paid Apple $20\nbillion in 2022 as part of its contract.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey [Google\u2019s agreements with web browsers and device makers to be the\ndefault search engine] basically freeze the ecosystem in place...\u201d said\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy to the DOJ.\n\nThe result has been that Google has a 90% share of the search market,\naccording to the DOJ, while Bing has just 5.5% and Yahoo! has about 2%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Read more\n\nGoogle has a 90% share of the search market, DOJ says\n\nGoogle paid Apple $20 billion to be Safari\u2019s default search engine\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nKein Scherz: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nverbraucher-zeitung.de\n\nJapanische Erfindung reinigt jedes Badezimmer in 5 MinutenWie konnten wir\ndieses japanische Reinigungsgeheimnis nicht kennen?verbraucher-zeitung.de|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nSolar Vergleich\n\nRentner entdeckt \"Solar-Erfindung\" - Industrie sprachlos(Was Medien deutschen\nHausbesitzern verschweigen.)Solar Vergleich|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nverbraucher-zeitung.de\n\nJapaner putzen nicht, sie machen dies (Es ist genial!)Wie konnten wir dieses\njapanische Reinigungsgeheimnis nicht kennen?verbraucher-zeitung.de|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\nHydrip\n\nHandsauger: Erfindung aus Deutschland erobert gerade ganz\nDeutschlandSaugwunder: Tierhaare, Staub, Schmutz in kleinen Ritzen schafft\ndieser Handsauger kinderleicht.Hydrip|\n\nSponsoredSponsored\n\n", "frontpage": false}
