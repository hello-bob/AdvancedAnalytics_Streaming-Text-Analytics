One reason is that its scale\nis unintuitive. A correlation denotes the gain in Y if you change X by one\nstandard deviation (SD). The problems that follow if you square that value\nwere explained well by Hunter and Schmidt:\n\n> The \u201cpercentage of variance accounted for\u201d... leads to severe underestimates\n> of the practical and theoretical significance of relationships between\n> variables. This is because r2 (and all other indexes of percentage of\n> variance accounted for) are related only in a very nonlinear way to the\n> magnitudes of effect sizes that determine their impact in the real world.\n\nOr more intuitively:\n\n> The ballpark is ten miles away, but a friend gives you a ride for the first\n> five miles.

A popular one\nintroduced by Rosenthal and Rubin in 1982 is the binomial effect size display,\nor BESD. The BESD is an excellent way of conveying how something that explains\n\u201conly\u201d a small share of the variance in something else can have enormous\npractical implications. Consider this table:\n\nThis table is based on a meta-analysis of psychotherapy outcome studies where\npsychotherapy \u201conly\u201d explained 10% of the variance in living or dying (i.e., r\n= 0.32). Per Rosenthal and Rubin, the \u201ctable shows clearly that it is absurd\nto label as \u2018modest indeed\u2019 an effect size equivalent to increasing the\nsuccess rate from 34% to 66% (e.g., reducing a death rate from 66% to 34%).\u201d\n\nYears later, Rosenthal followed up on the BESD and provided more examples of\nwhy it was such an important innovation. To wit, the BESD showed the impacts\nof\n\n  * Aspirin on heart attacks (r = -0.034)\n\n  * Propranolol on heart attacks (-0.04)\n\n  * Serving in Vietnam on alcohol abuse or dependence (0.07)\n\n  * Azidothymidine on AIDS survival (0.23)\n\n  * Cyclosporine on organ rejection (-0.19) and patient survival (0.15)\n\n> Use of the BESD has... shown that we are doing considerably better in our\n> softer, wilder sciences than we may have thought we were doing. It would\n> help keep us better apprised of how we are doing in our sciences if we\n> routinely translated the typical answers to our research questions to effect\n> sizes such as r (and to its equivalent displays) and compared them with\n> other well-established findings such as [the above.]\n\nIt\u2019s now years later, so let\u2019s see some other effect sizes in medicine,\nexpressed as correlations:\n\nLink\n\nIt\u2019s easy to agree with Rosenthal, or at least with his point: we need better\nways to compare effects. Thinking of effects like a coin flip a la Rosenthal\nis very appealing, But I think the BESD is the wrong way to go about achieving\nhis goal.\n\n###\n\nSimplifications Fail\n\nI\u2019m going to generate 1,000 observations of two standard normal variables, X\nand Y, correlated at r = 0.20. I\u2019ll divide the plotted area by the theoretical\nmedians for both variables and then calculate the BESD-implied correlation\nusing the percentages in each quadrant so that I can compare it to the true,\nunderlying correlation the data was generated upon.\n\nAt this correlation, everything looks good for Rosenthal. Now, let\u2019s see a\ncorrelation of 0.30:\n\nEverything still looks good, so let\u2019s keep going to 0.40.\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that I should make this note: I have tried to pick the\nclosest possible correlation to the target correlation out of seeds 0 to\n10,000. That means that the failure to reach 0.40 reflects something real. So\nlet\u2019s see 0.50.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll finish with this: 0.60.\n\nIs the gap just continuously growing as the true correlation rises? Since\nthat\u2019s easy to simulate by gathering the differences between BESD-implied\ncorrelations and true correlations for several thousands seeds, that\u2019s easy to\nfigure out. Here\u2019s the answer:1\n\nWhen two standard, normally-distributed variables are dichotomized, they don\u2019t\nneatly affirm the workings of the BESD. In fact, there are many more\nconditions where the BESD is not clearly affirmed, such as when tables like\nthe \u201cOnly 10%\u201d one shown above instead do not have uniform marginal\ndistributions.2\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the BESD doesn\u2019t just work as a way to convert between\neffect sizes\u2014itself a fraught practice\u2014 and intuitive real-world effects, but\nit\u2019s to be expected. After all, the \u2018correct\u2019 statistic to report to\nunderstand a relationship or an effect could never just be one, universally\napplicable value.\n\n###\n\nEffects in Context\n\nPygmies are very short. That\u2019s the thing they\u2019re best known for, and it\u2019s\nobvious why.\n\nThe reason Pygmies are so small isn\u2019t just poor environments, it\u2019s largely a\ngenetic phenomenon. We know many of the genetic antecedents of small Pygmy\nstature, but even if we didn\u2019t we know them, the quality of Pygmy environments\nhasn\u2019t historically been very differentiated from their neighbors, and yet\nthose non-Pygmy neighbors have never been as small. The neighboring Tikar are\nmuch more normal!\n\nAs it turns out, Pygmies and neighboring groups have interbred. Just as\ninterestingly, pygmies with greater admixture from those neighboring groups\ntend to be a bit taller.\n\nBecker et al. 2011, Fig. 4.\n\nIf we wanted to understand what proportion of the difference was genetic, we\ncould check the correlation between admixture from a taller group and height.\nIf, say, the average Pygmy had 10% admixture from a taller group with an SD of\n15% whereas the non-Pygmy population averaged 99% taller group and two SDs\ntaller, the correlation coefficient required to explain the whole mean\ndifference from within the Pygmy group would be 0.34, or an r2 of 11%. Just\n11%! Not to beat up on variance explained, but if the height gap were one SD,\nthe expected r would be 0.17, or 2.9% of the variance\u2014a very different\nexpectation in squared terms, but a predictably smaller one if we use r.\n\nA \u201csmall to modest\u201d correlation can easily explain a major difference in trait\nmeans between two groups. That\u2019s one context. Another is liability threshold\nmodels.\n\nA now well-known example is that it doesn\u2019t take very much of a relationship\nbetween social media use and depression to explain a large, recent increase in\ndepression. In this short animation, we can see that, in a world without\nsocial media, the depression rate would obviously be unrelated to social media\nuse since there\u2019s not really any social media use. But, when we add it in and\nindividual differences in social media use take their toll, a \u201csmall\u201d\ncorrelation of 0.16 (2.6% of the variance!) could increase depression rates to\n154% of their level when social media wasn\u2019t around.\n\n###\n\nOne Size Does Not Fit All\n\nIn 1979, Rosenthal and Rubin remarked that \u201can appropriate measure of effect\nsize must be sensitive to the context of the data.\u201d\n\nI agree with Rosenthal and Rubin, but shockingly many people do not. There are\npeople who think a correlation of 0.30 is always small, or that significance\nis dependent on the absolute level of a correlation and nothing below 0.71 is\nsignificant. There\u2019s no way to defend those beliefs, but they\u2019re persistent in\nthe public mind.\n\nSo if we want to communicate scientific results\u2014and especially those from\nfields where effect sizes feel \u201csmall\u201d to the lay public\u2014, I have one\nprinciple to suggest: whenever you have the ability to do so, place effects\ninto an appropriate context before presenting them in terms of well-known,\nfrequently misunderstood effect sizes.\n\n1\n\nThat answer was computed with sample sizes of 1,000 and 5,000 seeds. This uses\nN\u2019s of 10,000 and 10,000 seeds:\n\n2\n\nI\u2019ve discussed what statistic the BESD more clearly corresponds to before.\n\n### Subscribe to Cremieux Recueil\n\nHundreds of paid subscribers\n\nI discuss papers that ought to be discussed.\n\n31 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n31\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Correlations and Coin Flips\n\nwww.cremieux.xyz\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n1 Comment\n\nHeadless Marbles2 hrs agoLiked by CremieuxVery nicely illustrated.
