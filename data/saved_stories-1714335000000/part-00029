He had just been on air, and I was about to go on to talk about\nmy area of expertise, the latest immigration controversy. (Yes, this is a very\nDC story.) I asked him what he was working on and he said, \u201cThe fertility\ncrisis.\u201d I was broadly aware of concepts like the demographic transition,\nfalling total fertility rates, and how even immigrants from high-fertility\nsocieties rapidly decrease their fertility after arrival. Well-worn books by\nBryan Caplan, Jonathan List, and Julian Simon about how children and a higher\npopulation are great and why falling birth rates are bad have been with me for\nyears, but this was the first I\u2019d heard of a crisis.\n\nKnowing that I worked on immigration policy, my acquaintance said that\nimmigrants assimilate too rapidly to America\u2019s low-fertility culture and we\nhave to find a way to slow assimilation to boost the birthrate. I disagreed\nvehemently because I support cultural assimilation (which is going well, by\nthe way), but also because he had misdiagnosed the mechanism. \u201cThey\u2019re not\nassimilating to America\u2019s low-fertility culture,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re\nassimilating to high opportunity cost in the United States, which is the\nreason why they\u2019re here in the first place.\u201d He asked what I\u2019d do to increase\nfertility if that were the only outcome I cared about. After clarifying that I\ndon\u2019t support this policy, I said that I\u2019d massively increase marginal tax\nrates on the second worker in any household to force them out of the labor\nmarket, which would lower their opportunity cost of having children. Then the\nproducer came out and hustled me on set.\n\nThat conversation has stuck with me because people who worry about low\nfertility focus on vague cultural explanations and don\u2019t look at the simple\none staring them in the face: microeconomics. Opportunity cost is what you\nmust give up to buy what you want in terms of other goods or services, but the\nconcept applies to every action you take. If I go to the movie theater on a\nFriday at 7pm, I give up the opportunity to spend that time watching a Netflix\nmovie at home. The cost of going to the movie theater is watching the Netflix\nmovie at home, or any other activity that\u2019s second on my list of desires. The\nmore options I have, the potentially higher the opportunity cost I face.\n\nOur wealthy, productive, and vast modern world is full of economic\nopportunities for men and women, as well as a fantastic array of entertainment\noptions. Unemployment is historically low, job openings are high, and wages\nare rising. Female labor-force participation is close to 60 percent, slightly\nbelow historical highs, and more people go to college than ever before to\nsignal that they have the intelligence, discipline, and skills to earn high\nincomes.\n\nTomorrow, I could book a flight to over 100 countries to see wondrous natural\nand man-made sights. There are thousands of good restaurants and bars within\nan hour\u2019s drive. I could never hope to sample fully the range of tasty cuisine\nand alcoholic beverages available to me. The internet is at my fingertips,\nwith billions of interesting articles, tweets, and videos that could fill my\nday. The number and quality of new books that I can download is difficult to\neven describe. Shooting ranges (I\u2019m an American, after all), axe throwing,\ncigar lounges, rock climbing, and various novel and new exercise classes at\ngyms are close by\u2014to say nothing of activities I\u2019m not even aware of yet. And\nI have numerous friends and many potential friends who are just a phone call\nor text away. Streaming services bring the golden age of television and movies\ninto my household. And the list goes on.\n\nThese and other options mean that every choice we make has a high opportunity\ncost regarding our careers and entertainment options. When countries develop,\nfertility falls for this and other reasons. New immigrants drop their\nfertility because the opportunity cost of raising children is higher in a\ncountry with enormous economic opportunities, high incomes, and vast cheap\nentertainment possibilities.\n\nBut the effect isn't limited to immigrants; it also crushes fertility for\nnative-born Americans. Despite the nostalgianomics of Robert Reich and Josh\nHawley, two-income households aren\u2019t vastly more common than they used to be\nbecause of a brutal Malthusian competition for increasingly scarce resources.\nWomen work because their wages are so much higher than they used to be. There\nisn\u2019t a two-income trap\u2014there\u2019s expanded female economic opportunity, and this\nopportunity cost is contributing mightily to the decline in fertility.\n\nEconomists are generally loath to ask people why they make the decisions they\ndo (except for the venerable late and great Ronald Coase), but so are those\nwho are most worried about the decline in fertility. Or they could just watch\nthe latest internet sensation of two DINKs (dual income, no kids) explaining\nall the things they do instead of having kids. It\u2019s hard to explain the\nbenefits of children to people who don\u2019t have them, but it\u2019s easy to describe\nthe opportunity cost. I used to roll my eyes when people said, \u201cHaving kids is\nthe best thing I ever did, and my kids are my life,\u201d but then I realized how\ntrue it is. The insights of evolution make it painfully obvious.\n\n> I pray these people find meaning. Very sad. pic.twitter.com/Wz8RFZ3uVb\n>\n> \u2014 Marty Bent (@MartyBent) December 5, 2023\n\nAfter I had my first child, I described to a philosophy PhD friend how my new\nfeelings revealed the poverty of the English language. My deep feelings for my\nchildren deserve a word other than love, which we use to describe feelings for\nour spouse or an excellent movie, and I never felt that before learning that\nmy wife was pregnant and seeing my son for the first time. I think I would lay\ndown my life to protect my wife\u2014I certainly hope I would if it ever came to\nit. My wife has said the same to me. But after we had our son, we had a frank\nconversation about it. I said, \u201cI think I\u2019d sacrifice my life for you, and I\u2019d\nwant to, but there might be a moment of hesitation. But I have zero hesitation\nto lay down my life to protect our son.\u201d I acquired a love and empathy that I\nhad never experienced before. She agreed on both counts. My philosopher friend\nsaid that it sounded like having children was a \u201cconsciousness-expanding\nexperience,\u201d which was a great way to put it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to convey those intense feelings to people who don\u2019t have children.\nWe see people putting themselves in dangerous and extreme situations to save\ntheir children all the time, and it\u2019s not surprising that they do so. We\nnotice when people put themselves in similar situations to save people they\naren't related to because it\u2019s so uncommon. But the costs of having children\nare obvious, understandable, and relatable to other costs that people\nincur\u2014especially the opportunity costs. Having children is exhausting\ninitially (it gets much better, trust me). Waking up every three hours for a\nfeeding is painful, and you really don\u2019t realize how bad it is until you get a\nsix-hour block of sleep weeks or months after the baby is born.\n\nForget About Overpopulation, Soon There Will Be Too Few Humans\n\nThe more people there are, the more solutions to problems will be found.\n\nQuilletteMaarten Boudry\n\nEverybody knows that newborns are exhausting, and, more importantly, they know\nwhat it feels like to be exhausted before having a baby. People also know that\nhaving a child changes your life. It\u2019s more difficult to have a beer with\ncolleagues after work, go on that important work trip to seal a deal, or take\nthe high-stress long-hours job that pays more, especially for women. It\u2019s\nharder to see your friends on a whim, take vacations to fascinating places, or\ntry new activities that take preparation and skill. Just try learning how to\nrock-climb with a baby.\n\nI'm not arguing that people should refrain from having children. I\u2019m merely\nsetting out the benefits and costs. My wife and I have three children, and I\nwant to have more, but my wife is reasonably more reluctant. She has chosen\njobs that offer flexibility and predictability rather than higher paying and\nmore demanding jobs. She no doubt has sacrificed income as a result. I'm proud\nof her for having a rewarding career and three children because it\u2019s a\ntestament to her intelligence, foresight, energy, and organizational skills\nthat she can make it work. She also knows that having another child could\nentirely knock her out of the labor force. We estimate that purely from lost\nincome, it has cost her (and our household) about $350,000 to have children so\nfar, not including the lost capital gains. Having another one could bump that\nto about $2 million if she stops working for some years.\n\nOn the entertainment side, my wife makes the lucid point that more children\nmean we can\u2019t go on as many or as interesting vacations. This doesn\u2019t bother\nme because I dislike traveling, but she enjoys it. Even traveling across the\ncountry to see our families is significantly more costly and difficult with\nchildren, and we certainly are constrained from doing it impulsively. We see\nour friends less, eat out much less, travel less, try fewer new things, and\ngenerally experience the wider world less because we have children. It takes\nonly a moment\u2019s reflection to realize that she and our household are paying an\nenormous cost for our fertility. It\u2019s worth it, and almost all people think\nthe benefits exceed the costs, but the cost is very high and rising.\n\nThe DINKs video is enraging to people worried about the decline in fertility,\nbut you must be blind to ignore its coherent argument about the opportunity\ncost of having children. The bad news is that the fixed cost, or overhead, of\nhaving children in terms of opportunity cost is high. Having a child changes\nyour life dramatically and makes the costs I describe obvious. But the good\nnews is that the marginal cost, or the cost of having more than one, is much\nlower. The total cost rises with more children, probably to a point, but the\ncost of going from one to two is much lower than going from zero to one. Just\nwitness how much more relaxed and less anxious people are when they have their\nsecond child compared to the first. And the third is a breeze. Hopefully, I\nwill find out that the fourth is also easy.\n\nThis brings me back to my comments in the green room at Fox. Immigrant\nfertility rapidly falls because immigrants, especially women, have\nsignificantly more economic opportunity in the United States, so they make the\nchoice to have fewer children and work to make more money. People who are very\nconcerned about the fertility crisis and want to reverse it should be the most\ninterested in understanding the causes of the decline in the first place. This\nis why I find the vague \u201ccultural\u201d arguments that people raise for not having\nchildren so frustrating. Culture is the set of human actions that evolved to\npartially deal with the problems of the past and to harness opportunities.\nCulture is not some magical force outside of economics, politics, or\ntechnology but a set of human actions affected by economics, politics, and\ntechnology. Culture, in turn, affects economics, politics, and technology. To\nargue for changing the \u201cculture\u201d without changing the rest is simply\nunserious.\n\nCulture isn\u2019t irrelevant, but cultural practices often emerge from changes\nwrought by economics, politics, technology, or elsewhere. Cultural attitudes\nmatter considerably, and many intangibles, such as the approval of strangers,\nlocal mores, and religious belief all greatly influence individual fertility\nchoices. People make decisions for myriad, complex reasons that are poorly\nunderstood. Often, people have aesthetic preferences that they act upon.\nAnalyzing opportunity cost can\u2019t explain everything, but it is an ignored or\noften ridiculed partial explanation that deserves serious consideration.\n\nConservatives and traditionalists on Twitter attempted to shame the DINKs\nvideo. I write \u201cattempted\u201d because the shamers will fail to change cultural\nnorms by scorning people whose behavior they dislike. Shaming works if most\npeople also disapprove of the targets, but most people don\u2019t disapprove of a\nchild-free life because the opportunity-cost is just too high, as the young\ncouple in the DINKs video were at pains to emphasize (albeit in less\nsophisticated economics terms).\n\nThose who write about cultural reasons for fertility will deserve to be taken\nseriously when they can point to widespread changing behaviors and hypothesize\nabout why they changed. People who blame (or credit) a changed culture of\nincreased sexual promiscuity on the development of cheap and effective\nprophylactics, birth control pills, and abortion are serious thinkers. Those\ntechnologies, where available, rapidly changed cultural practices and norms. I\ndisagree with social conservatives who want to ban or restrict birth control\nand condoms to roll back widespread sexual promiscuity, but at least they\nunderstand that the cultural behavior they dislike is downstream of economics\nand technology. One can recognize serious thinkers even when disagreeing with\ntheir conclusions.\n\nPunitive marginal tax rates on the second earner in a household would knock\nmany women (and some men) out of the labor force by lowering the opportunity\ncost of having children because there\u2019d be no career to give up. Further, it\nwould be an awful policy with numerous bad unintended consequences\u2014even on\nother issues that conservatives care about, like family formation and the\ndiminution of individual rights in service of collectivist goals. There are\nother ways to reduce the cost of having children, mainly through deregulation.\n\nThe DINKs video isn\u2019t shaping culture, it\u2019s a cultural response to the fact\nthat it\u2019s never been more expensive to have children when all the costs are\nconsidered. Until natalists acknowledge that, they\u2019ll just be screaming into\nthe void.\n\n  * Politics\n  * Family\n  * economics\n\n### Alex Nowrasteh\n\nAlex Nowrasteh is the vice president for economic and social-policy studies at\nThe Cato Institute.\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Website\n  * Washington\n\nKeep Reading\n\n## The Great Divide\n\nAs CCP corruption and waste has run rampant, the gulf between rich and poor\nhas widened.\n\nAaron Sarin\n\n27 Apr 2024 \u00b7 9 min read\n\n## Misadventures of a Stalinist Stooge\n\nBenn Steil\u2019s engrossing new biography of Henry A.
