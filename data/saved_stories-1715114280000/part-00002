Built using second-generation\n3-nanometer technology, M4 is a system on a chip (SoC) that advances the\nindustry-leading power efficiency of Apple silicon and enables the incredibly\nthin design of iPad Pro. It also features an entirely new display engine to\ndrive the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the breakthrough Ultra\nRetina XDR display on iPad Pro. A new CPU has up to 10 cores, while the new\n10-core GPU builds on the next-generation GPU architecture introduced in M3,\nand brings Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-\naccelerated mesh shading to iPad for the first time. M4 has Apple\u2019s fastest\nNeural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which\nis faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with\nfaster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning (ML)\naccelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro\nan outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe new iPad Pro with M4 is a great example of how building best-in-class\ncustom silicon enables breakthrough products,\u201d said Johny Srouji, Apple\u2019s\nsenior vice president of Hardware Technologies. \u201cThe power-efficient\nperformance of M4, along with its new display engine, makes the thin design\nand game-changing display of iPad Pro possible, while fundamental improvements\nto the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and memory system make M4 extremely well\nsuited for the latest applications leveraging AI. Altogether, this new chip\nmakes iPad Pro the most powerful device of its kind.\u201d\n\nM4 features a new display engine enabling the stunning precision, color\naccuracy, and brightness uniformity of the Ultra Retina XDR display.\n\nThe new CPU of M4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over the powerful\nM2 in the previous iPad Pro.\n\nPro rendering with the new up-to-10-core GPU of M4 is now up to four times\nfaster than on M2.\n\nM4 includes Apple\u2019s most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of 38 trillion\noperations per second \u2014 60x faster than the first Neural Engine in A11 Bionic.\n\n## New Technologies Enabling the New iPad Pro\n\nDelivering a giant leap in performance over the previous iPad Pro with M2, M4\nconsists of 28 billion transistors built using a second-generation 3-nanometer\ntechnology that further advances the power efficiency of Apple silicon. M4\nalso features an entirely new display engine designed with pioneering\ntechnologies, enabling the stunning precision, color accuracy, and brightness\nuniformity of the Ultra Retina XDR display, a state-of-the-art display created\nby combining the light of two OLED panels.\n\nM4 is designed with pioneering technologies that help enable the incredibly\nthin design of iPad Pro.\n\n## New 10-core CPU\n\nM4 has a new up-to-10-core CPU consisting of up to four performance cores and\nnow six efficiency cores. The next-generation cores feature improved branch\nprediction, with wider decode and execution engines for the performance cores,\nand a deeper execution engine for the efficiency cores. And both types of\ncores also feature enhanced, next-generation ML accelerators.\n\nM4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over the powerful M2 in the\nprevious iPad Pro.^1 Whether working with complex orchestral music files in\nLogic Pro or adding highly demanding effects to 4K video in LumaFusion, M4\nboosts performance across pro workflows.\n\nM4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over the powerful M2 in the\nprevious iPad Pro, boosting performance across pro workflows in apps like\nLogic Pro.\n\n## GPU Brings New Capabilities to iPad Pro\n\nThe new 10-core GPU of M4 builds upon the next-generation graphics\narchitecture of the M3 family of chips. It features Dynamic Caching, an Apple\ninnovation that allocates local memory dynamically in hardware and in real\ntime to dramatically increase the average utilization of the GPU. This\nsignificantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.\n\nThe new GPU of M4 will bring hardware-accelerated ray tracing to iPad for the\nfirst time, enabling even more realistic shadows and reflections in games like\nDiablo Immortal, and other graphically rich experiences.\n\nHardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to iPad for the first time, and enables\neven more realistic shadows and reflections in games and other graphically\nrich experiences. Hardware-accelerated mesh shading is also built into the\nGPU, and delivers greater capability and efficiency in geometry processing,\nenabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps.\nPro rendering performance in apps like Octane gets a huge boost with M4, and\nis now up to four times faster than on M2.^1 With these improvements to the\nCPU and GPU, M4 maintains Apple silicon\u2019s industry-leading performance per\nwatt. M4 can deliver the same performance as M2 using just half the power. And\ncompared with the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver\nthe same performance using just a fourth of the power.^2\n\nPro rendering performance in apps like Octane gets a huge boost with M4, and\nis now up to four times faster than on iPad Pro with M2.\n\n## The Most Powerful Neural Engine Ever\n\nM4 has a blazing-fast Neural Engine \u2014 an IP block in the chip dedicated to the\nacceleration of AI workloads. This is Apple\u2019s most powerful Neural Engine\never, capable of an astounding 38 trillion operations per second \u2014 a\nbreathtaking 60x faster than the first Neural Engine in A11 Bionic. Together\nwith next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, the high-performance GPU, and\nhigher-bandwidth unified memory, the Neural Engine makes M4 an outrageously\npowerful chip for AI. And with AI features in iPadOS like Live Captions for\nreal-time audio captions, and Visual Look Up, which identifies objects in\nvideo and photos, the new iPad Pro allows users to accomplish amazing AI tasks\nquickly and on device.\n\niPad Pro with M4 can easily isolate a subject from its background throughout a\n4K video in Final Cut Pro with just a tap, and can automatically create\nmusical notation in real time in StaffPad by simply listening to someone play\nthe piano. And inference workloads can be done efficiently and privately while\nminimizing the impact on app memory, app responsiveness, and battery life. The\nNeural Engine in M4 is Apple\u2019s most capable yet, and is more powerful than any\nneural processing unit in any AI PC today.\n\nM4 has a blazing-fast Neural Engine that can easily isolate a subject from its\nbackground throughout a 4K video in Final Cut Pro with just a tap.\n\n## Advanced Media Engine for Smooth, Efficient Streaming\n\nThe Media Engine of M4 is the most advanced to come to iPad. In addition to\nsupporting the most popular video codecs, like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes, it\nbrings hardware acceleration for AV1 to iPad for the first time. This provides\nmore power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from\nstreaming services.\n\n## Better for the Environment\n\nThe power-efficient performance of M4 helps the all-new iPad Pro meet Apple\u2019s\nhigh standards for energy efficiency and deliver all-day battery life. This\nresults in less time needing to be plugged in and less energy consumed over\nits lifetime.\n\nToday, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030,\nplans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and\nlife cycle of every product.\n\nShare article\n\n## Media\n\n  * Text of this article\n\nMay 7, 2024\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nApple introduces M4 chip\n\nM4 enables the breakthrough design and stunning display of the new iPad Pro,\nwhile delivering a giant leap in performance\n\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced M4, the latest chip delivering\nphenomenal performance to the all-new iPad Pro.
