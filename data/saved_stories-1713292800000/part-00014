Still, many scientific applications that read\nand write data in small chunks are limited by the ability of both the hardware\nand the software to handle such workloads efficiently. This problem will be\nexacerbated with exascale computers, which will allow scientific applications\nto run simulations at significantly larger scales. Even worse, scientific data\nis typically persisted out of order, creating the need to budget time and\nresources for a costly, massive sorting operation.\n\nDeltaFS is a new distributed file system service that addresses these issues.\nTo deal with the immense metadata load resulting from handling a large number\nof files, DeltaFS remains transient and software-defined. The transient\nproperty allows each application using DeltaFS to individually start, stop,\nand control the amount of computing resources dedicated to the file system by\nbootstrapping its own DeltaFS service across as many nodes as it needs,\neffectively controlling metadata performance. When combined with DeltaFS\u2019s\nsoftware-defined nature, this allows file system design and provisioning\ndecisions to be decoupled from the overall design of HPC platforms. Our\nexperiments (Figure 1) show that these properties allow DeltaFS to process two\norders of magnitude more file creation operations compared to prior\napproaches.\n\nFigure 1: File creation throughput with DeltaFS and prior work (IndexFS)  \n---  \n  \nAnother important goal of DeltaFS is to guarantee both fast writing and\nreading in the case of workloads consisting of small I/O transfers. A popular\nscientific application that would benefit from this is Vector-Particle-in-Cell\n(VPIC). VPIC simulates the movement of individual particles through their\ninteractions, and can output particle data for each simulated time step out of\norder. Scientists, however, are mostly interested in accessing all data for a\ngiven particle, e.g. to study its trajectory. To improve the performance of\nsuch applications, DeltaFS uses Indexed Massive Directories (IMDs). WIthin\nthis special directory type, out-of-order writes to a massive number of files\nget indexed in-situ as data is written to storage. This indexing enables quick\ndata accesses, without the need for post-processing the data. Our VPIC\nexperiments show a 5,000x speedup when particle trajectories are accessed\nthrough DeltaFS when 99 compute nodes are used on the LANL Trinity\nsupercomputer. We expect further improvement as simulation size (i.e., output\nsize) increases.\n\nFigure 2: Performance of particle trajectory queries under DeltaFS  \n---  \n  \n### People\n\nFACULTY\n\nGeorge Amvrosiadis Chuck Cranor Greg Ganger\n\nGRAD STUDENTS\n\nQing Zheng Saurabh Kadekodi\n\nALUMNI\n\nKai Ren\n\nPARTNERS\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory: Gary Grider, Brad Settlemyer, Fan Guo Argonne\nNational Laboratory: Robert B.
