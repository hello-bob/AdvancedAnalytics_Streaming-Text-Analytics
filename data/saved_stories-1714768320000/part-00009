With this, the watch line capped its four decades of\npopularity to date with recognition of its popularity with consumers for its\niconic shape.\n\n5.1k Shares\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nShare\n\nRead in other languages\n\n  * English\n  * \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n  * \u7b80\u4f53\u5b57\n  * \u7e41\u9ad4\u5b57\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n  * \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n\n## G-Shock Wins Rare Trademark\n\nCasio\u2019s digital G-Shock watch was created in 1983 based on the \u201ctriple 10\u201d\nconcept: 10-meter fall shock resistance, 10 bars of water resistance, and\n10-year battery life. Its unique toughness has evolved over the 40 years since\nand has won it passionate fans worldwide.\n\nOn June 26, 2023, the G-Shock\u2019s shape\u2014without any logo, company names or other\nlettering at all\u2014was granted a three-dimensional trademark by the Japan Patent\nOffice. The authority based this on Article 3, Section 2 of the Trademark Act,\nsaying that it qualifies because \u201cconsumers are able to recognize the goods or\nservices as those pertaining to a business of a particular person\u201d\u2014in other\nwords, because the shape has become truly distinctive for customers after its\nyears of use. This is the first time in Japan that a watch has been so\nrecognized. Now, these watches have been confirmed as not only uniquely\ndurable, but uniquely shaped.\n\nThe trademark was granted for the shape initiated by the very first G-Shock,\nthe DW-5000C model, with its distinctive square bezel. The current Origin\nseries maintains this basic square design, which has contributed to its long\npopularity. Matsumura Satoko, head of Casio\u2019s IP Legal and Licensing\nDepartment, says, \u201cThe first-generation model truly is a masterpiece for\nCasio. It has a polished design with no waste, and even today serves to help\nhone our technical capabilities, because whenever we incorporate new\nfunctions, we develop them to fit inside this case.\u201d She goes on to explain\nthat the company applied for a three-dimensional trademark in hopes that it\nwould contribute to the company\u2019s branding around the watch\u2019s fortieth\nanniversary.\n\nThere is only one surviving first-generation G-Shock at Casio\u2019s head office.\n(\u00a9 Nippon.com)\n\nMatsumura helped push the G-Shock\u2019s three-dimensional trademark registration.\n(\u00a9 Nippon.com)\n\n## Difficulties in Attaining Text-Free Trademarks\n\nA three-dimensional trademark recognizes the right of protection for 3D shapes\nthat distinguish a given good or service. The concept was introduced in Japan\nin 1996, and more and more companies apply every year. According to the Patent\nOffice\u2019s annual report, it received 311 applications in 2022, of which 202\nwere registered.\n\nHowever, that 202 number includes applications including lettering. According\nto an investigation by Casio, of 50 registered trademarks without lettering,\nit seems only three have the same \u201cdistinctiveness through use\u201d recognized for\nG-Shock.\n\nMatsumura says that the company first sought to register the G-Shock for a\nthree-dimensional trademark in 2005, but only succeeded with a mark including\nthe logo and text. At the time, the watch had been on sale for over 20 years\nand had seen a major boom in the 1990s, but blank, text-free registration was\nsimply too difficult.\n\nThe drive to reapply for text-free registration began in the fall of 2020.\nYonekura Masako of the company\u2019s Trademark and Design Section, who worked on\nthe approach to registration, says, \u201cThe main requirement we had to clear was\nexplaining the distinctiveness.\u201d Essentially every watch consists of a case\nand strap, meaning they generally all look similar, so convincing the patent\noffice would be a steep hill to climb.\n\nThe image at left is the blank three-dimensional image that was successfully\nregistered. Because Casio filed with a basic black and gray image, differences\nin color and material will also be covered. To the right is a first-generation\nDW-5000C model photographed from the same angle. (\u00a9 Casio Computer)\n\nThe top-left watch is the first-generation model, while the rest are all\nsubsequent variations on the design. (\u00a9 Nippon.com)\n\nThe application was filed April 2021, and it took over two years for approval.\nCasio submitted massive amounts of supporting material, including the total\nnumber of G-Shock watches shipped\u2014over 140 million\u2014and sales numbers from over\n140 countries, the number of products sharing the first model\u2019s design, and\ncopies of newspaper and magazine articles. One of the most persuasive\narguments for distinctiveness, though, was a consumer survey.\n\nA total of 1,100 people age 16 and up were presented with the logo- and text-\nfree image like that used in the trademark application. The result was that in\na free response question, 55% identified the shape as a G-Shock, while 66% did\nso in a multiple-choice question. Yonekura explains, \u201cThe fact that more than\n60% of respondents in the multiple-choice question could distinguish it even\nwithout the logo was a better result than we\u2019d expected. This survey and the\noverall three-dimensional trademark registration have helped display the\nG-Shock brand value.\u201d\n\nYonekura was responsible for gathering the survey results and application\nmaterials. (\u00a9 Nippon.com)\n\n## Popular Products with 3D Trademarks\n\nIn looking at past trademarks, we find that those without lettering read like\na list of the most iconic \u201cMade in Japan\u201d products there are. Let\u2019s take a\nlook at a few.\n\nThe Kikk\u014dman table-top soy sauce dispenser is registered both in Japan and in\nthe United States. The bottle was the work of one of Japan\u2019s great industrial\ndesigners, Ekuan Kenji, and since its release in 1961 has been sold in over\n100 countries.\n\nOn top of its simply yet beautiful design, it is full of functionality, as\nwell: the pourer has a downward sloping design that prevents dripping, the\nbottle\u2019s neck narrows to make it easier to hold, and the bottom spreads out to\nprevent toppling. The bottle has become synonymous with soy sauce, such that\neven people who use other brands often refill them into this bottle. Another\ncontainer, the Yakult plastic drink bottle, was registered in 2018, 50 years\nafter it went on sale in 1968.\n\nThe Kikk\u014dman tabletop bottle (Reg. 6031041) is to the left, and the Yakult\nplastic container (Reg. 5384525) on the right. (Courtesy J-PlatPat)\n\nThe Meiji chocolate treats Kinoko no Yama (on sale since 1975 and registered\nin 2018) and Takenoko no Sato (on sale since 1979 and registered in 2021) are\nalso trademarked, but rather than the packaging, the shapes of the snacks,\nmushrooms and bamboo shoots, respectively, themselves made the grade. Surely\ntheir years of sales success and survey responses helped to show their\ndistinctiveness.\n\nKinoko no Yama (Reg. 6031305) is to the left and Takenoko no Sato (reg.\n6419263) is to the right. (Courtesy J-PlatPat)\n\nIt can be easy to show distinctiveness for products with lots of sales and\nreasonable prices, making them part of daily life, but a more unusual example\nis Honda\u2019s scooter, the Super Cub.\n\nLaunched in 1958, the Super Cub is a super-long seller, but one with a\npersistent design concept. At the point that it achieved registration in 2014,\nit had sold of 87 million bikes in over 160 countries worldwide, making it the\nbest-selling motorbike in the world. It was also the first vehicle to attain\nregistration from shape alone, and one of the G-Shock\u2019s few mechanical\nprecedents.\n\nThe Super Cub (reg. 5674666) can be seen running worldwide. (Courtesy\nJ-PlatPat)\n\n## A Home for Unfading Memories\n\nAll the hit products shown here ran into speedbumps on the way to\nregistration, just like the G-Shock. But even when an application was\ninitially denied, these companies went on to gather evidence that consumers\nsee the distinctiveness, submitted surveys, and achieved their goal of\ntrademark registration. Unlike patents, which have a limited duration, a\ntrademark can be maintained forever if it is renewed every 10 years. It is a\npowerful right to hold, and that helps explain the difficulty of getting one\nfor a text-free image.\n\nWhen I asked Yonekura about how she felt after succeeding in such a difficult\nmission, she said, \u201cI really understood the size of the G-Shock brand value,\u201d\nas if she\u2019d forgotten all about the hard work. She went on with a laugh: \u201cI\nwas happy to see all the comments on web articles and social media from\nG-Shock fans celebrating it.\u201d\n\nMatsumura also received an email from overseas which made her happy the\ncompany had tried again. It read, \u201cMy parents got me a G-Shock for my birthday\nwhen I was a child, and I am grateful to you for bringing those memories\nback.\u201d She goes on to say, \u201cI want to keep working hard on projects for\nintellectual property and branding. This was just the first step, and I think\nit was a good start.\u201d\n\nYonekura and Matsumura at the Casio headquarters showroom. (\u00a9 Nippon.com)\n\n(Originally published in Japanese.
