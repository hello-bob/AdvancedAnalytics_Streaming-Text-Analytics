It provides a high-level API for performing actions like\nclicking, typing, and waiting for elements using visual cues such as text and\nimages. With VisBrowser, you can automate web browsing tasks by leveraging the\nvisual layout and content of the page, making your scripts more resilient to\nchanges in the underlying HTML structure. Particularly useful for website\nwhich doesn't give a proper dom, like fuller website, or websites using HTML\ncanvas.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the Visual Browser Adapter, use pip:\n\n    \n    \n    pip install git+https://github.com/hargup/visbrowser.git\n\n## API Reference\n\n### click_image(page, image_path, confidence=0.8)\n\nClicks on an image on the page that matches the specified image file.\n\n  * page: The Playwright page object.\n  * image_path: The path to the image file to search for on the page.\n  * confidence (optional): The minimum confidence level (between 0 and 1) for a match to be considered valid.
