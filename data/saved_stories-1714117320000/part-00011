Much of it gets rejected by wholesalers and\nretailers based on irregularities in weight, size or shape.\n\nThis desire for cosmetically appealing food also extends to consumers, as we\noften prefer picture-perfect produce. Unsurprisingly, this wanton waste takes\na significant environmental toll, with an estimated eight to 10 per cent of\nglobal greenhouse gas emissions tied to unconsumed food.\n\n## Showing ugly produce some love\n\nSome companies have taken strides to counter food waste. A prominent example\nin the United States is Misfits Market, which launched in 2018.\n\nBy buying misshapen and ugly produce and reselling it at discount prices in\nsubscription boxes, Misfits Market has grown into a billion-dollar business.\n\nCloser to home, Loblaw Companies\u2019 \u201cnaturally imperfect\u201d line offers visually\nunappealing produce at lower prices, while newcomers such as Montr\u00e9al-based\nFood Hero are developing apps to reduce a different but persistent form of\nwaste by helping customers find deals on food approaching its best-by date.\n\nA customer shops for produce at a grocery store In Toronto in February 2024.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Cole Burston\n\nDespite such encouraging efforts, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do on\nchanging attitudes and behaviours to alleviate waste. This has become an\nimportant academic issue, and is increasingly being tackled by those of us in\nmarketing, a field that has perpetuated this cycle of waste.\n\nIn a recent study, we introduced our RESCUER framework designed to expose\nstudents to food waste and to generate behavioural changes. We developed it\nover three years through research assignments undertaken by students in our\nclasses at Carleton University. We used 90 reflective essay assignments\nalongside 63 sets of surveys (administered pre- and post-assignment) to\ndevelop the framework.\n\n## Steps towards change\n\nRESCUER stands for the steps in the process of learning, action and change\nundertaken by students, and combines passive and active modes of learning.\n\nWe first engaged students with resources \u2014 \u201cpassive\u201d forms of learning through\nlectures and curated readings on food waste, irregularly shaped produce and\nsustainable practices.\n\nNext, students engaged in an experiential learning exercise that had them\nactively planning, shopping for and preparing a salad with food waste issues\nin mind, before writing reflective journals about their experiences.\nJournaling allows students to articulate their feelings, thoughts and values,\nleads them to examine and challenge pre-conceived assumptions, practices and\npolicies, and encourages them to be more alert when shopping for and preparing\nfood.\n\nWe next accounted for the social influences of family, friends and peers on\nsustainability-minded behaviours.\n\nThroughout the process, students developed a greater cognizance of food waste,\nand these issues became more readily and consistently resonant when shopping.\nThe process also resulted in underlying problem-salience \u2014 the spontaneous\nevocation of the food waste problem in consumers\u2019 minds as soon as they need\nto buy or prepare food.\n\nFinally, we identified factors that expedite learning and adoption processes,\nsuch as the availability of recycling and composting facilities at home and\naccess to retailers that support sustainable practices and provide price\ndiscounts.\n\nA worker stocks shelves of produce at a Metro grocery store. THE CANADIAN\nPRESS/Cole Burston\n\n## Student comments\n\nThe results? Well, students emerged with a much deeper understanding of food\nwaste and an increase in responsible attitudes and behaviours. This increase\nin responsibility is evident in the comments from students about RESCUER,\nincluding:\n\n> \u201cI am cognizant of the negative effects that food abnormalities have on the\n> environment due to food waste issues. On that account, I will surely change\n> some of my habits to match my perceived identity. Seeing myself as, and\n> wanting to be more of, a pro-environmental person, I want my actions\n> regarding food waste to match this desired self-identity.\u201d\n\nThe students\u2019 newfound awareness also translated into more responsible\nconsumption behaviours. They started choosing imperfect produce, as one\nstudent reported:\n\n> \u201cI bought abnormal carrots and green onions and even considered some oddly\n> shaped bell peppers in my purchase decisions.\u201d\n\nThey also became less picky about expiration dates, according to another\nstudent who was conscious of preventing waste:\n\n> \u201cCompleting this assignment has increased my awareness to ensure to take the\n> foods on the shelves that are approaching their best-before date as opposed\n> to selecting the freshest option each time.\u201d\n\nAnother responsible action is in how students spread what they have learned,\nas one noted:\n\n> \u201cI am certainly going to share what I have learned from the readings with\n> friends and family.\u201d\n\nThese qualitative findings are further validated by our survey results. A\ncomparative analysis was conducted before and after the framework\u2019s\nimplementation. It revealed that students\u2019 awareness, understanding and\nactions related to sustainability were all improved after having completed the\nexercise.\n\n## Educators can change attitudes\n\nOverall, we\u2019ve seen our RESCUER framework cultivate a shift towards\nresponsible consumption, and it also situates marketing education within a\nsustainability narrative.\n\nOurs is an example of how educators can play a crucial role in changing\nattitudes and actions, and in equipping future professionals with tools to\ntackle the challenges of sustainability.\n\nConversations about what sustainability entails, how it can be encouraged and\nits integration into education is more relevant than ever as we strive for\nways to work towards a more sustainable future.\n\n  * Marketing\n  * Food\n  * Sustainability\n  * Food waste\n  * Grocery stores\n  * Food shopping\n  * Loblaws\n  * Groceries\n  * Grocery chains\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Project Offier - Diversity & Inclusion\n\n  * ##### Senior Lecturer - Earth System Science\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
