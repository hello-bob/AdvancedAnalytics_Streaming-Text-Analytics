But even rocks from\nspace aren\u2019t immune to warming-weather-related upheavals either.\n\nMeteorites are fragments of other worlds that survive whizzing through Earth\u2019s\natmosphere to land as dull, scorched-black rocks. For decades, planetary\nscientists have used meteorites to better understand the distant places they\ncome from, and Antarctica has been a particularly valuable source, supplying\nmore than 60 percent of those collected to date. But the bounty may be\ndisappearing, according to research published on April 8 in the journal Nature\nClimate Change. In it, scientists estimate that we\u2019re already losing Antarctic\nmeteorites faster than we collect them\u2014and that the rate of loss will increase\nas the planet continues to warm, with the rocks sinking deep in the ice\nsheets, out of scientists\u2019 reach.\n\nAlthough scientists have collected some 80,000 meteorites to date, there\u2019s no\ntelling which ones will reveal something new. \u201cUsually, a few of the\nmeteorites that are brought back every season are something we\u2019ve never seen\nbefore,\u201d says Cari Corrigan, a geologist and curator of the Antarctic\nmeteorite collection at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington,\nD.C., who peer-reviewed the new paper but wasn\u2019t directly involved in the\nresearch. \u201cEach one is kind of a piece of a puzzle that helps us understand\nhow the whole solar system formed.\u201d\n\nThis solar system detritus lands anywhere and everywhere on Earth, but most\nmeteorites are lost\u2014they plummet into the ocean or immediately blend in with\nterrestrial rocks. In Antarctica, in contrast, dark space rocks stand out from\nthe bleak terrain. In addition, the ice\u2019s slow flow over the continent\nconcentrates space rocks in specific regions that have become treasure troves\nfor scientists.\n\n\u201cMeteorites can fall anywhere on the ice sheet,\u201d says Veronica Tollenaar, a\ndoctoral candidate in glaciology at the Free University of Brussels (ULB) and\nco-author of the new research. \u201cThey become embedded into the ice, and they\nflow along with the ice, but when there is a barrier, the flow is redirected\ntoward the surface.\u201d That phenomenon is useful to scientists because it\nconcentrates the space rocks in particular locations. In some areas on the\ncontinent, harsh winds scour the ice from above, revealing meteorites and\nother material in the ice, where the rocks can lie for millennia. Scientists\ncall these spots \u201cblue ice\u201d because of their color. These two processes make\nfor easy meteorite hunting; even so, scientists estimate hundreds of thousands\nmore space rocks are still waiting to be found on Antarctica\u2019s ice.\n\nBut as the world warms, these Antarctic meteorite dynamics are changing. Just\nlike a black T-shirt on a sunny day, a meteorite on Antarctica\u2019s surface traps\nheat that then radiates into the surrounding ice. When air temperatures are\ncold enough, the extra heat doesn\u2019t make much difference\u2014but as climate change\nwarms the poles, the extra few degrees of heat from a meteorite will more\noften be enough to melt the ice around and under it, sending the rock deep\ninto the ice sheet, out of scientists\u2019 reach.\n\n\u201cTypically, once [a meteorite] is brought to the surface, it needs to kind of\nfight to stay at the surface,\u201d says study co-author Harry Zekollari, a\nglaciologist at Vrije University of Brussels (VLB) and the Swiss Federal\nInstitute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich). \u201cWhat we see is that there\u2019s kind\nof a magical threshold somewhere around minus 10 degrees Celsius [14 degrees\nFahrenheit].\u201d When temperatures are colder than that, the ice survives; any\nwarmer and meteorites begin to disappear\u2014even today. \u201cEvery year we find about\n1,000 meteorites, but we lose five times as many,\u201d Zekollari says.\n\nTollenaar, Zekollari and their colleagues used machine learning to identify\nwhere Antarctica\u2019s remaining treasure troves of meteorites may be and then\nprojected how different warming scenarios will affect each location.\n\nTheir analysis suggests that about a quarter of Antarctica\u2019s meteorites will\nbe lost by 2050\u2014and up to three quarters will be out of reach by 2100 under\nthe direst warming projections. Overall, Zekollari says, 1 or 2 percent of\nmeteorites will disappear with each additional tenth of a degree Celsius of\naverage warming. Corrigan notes that historically, the interior of Antarctica\nhasn\u2019t seen much snowfall, but increasing rates from climate change will hide\nmeteorites as well, further reducing the amount of samples scientists can\ncollect beyond what the analysis suggests.\n\nLosing meteorites has real consequences for scientists trying to understand\nthe solar system. Expeditions to Antarctica are challenging but not as\nchallenging as sending astronauts to the moon or robotic spacecraft to snag\nasteroid pieces, Corrigan says. \u201cIt is kind of a poor man\u2019s sample-return\nmission, although it still costs money.\u201d\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.
