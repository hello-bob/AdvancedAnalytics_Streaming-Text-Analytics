If not, you could be losing top professionals to the competition. Try\nthese five tips for creating a streamlined candidate experience that keeps\ndesirable professionals in the funnel.\n\nToday\u2019s tech workers expect a job application experience that\u2019s as enticing\nand effortless as the online consumer experience they\u2019re accustomed to in\ntheir daily lives. A clunky, outdated, or prolonged online application process\ncould be a big turnoff for top talent and create a perception that your\ncompany is behind the times.\n\nYou can help secure high-quality talent\u2014and accelerate your hiring process\u2014by\ndesigning your hiring and onboarding flow to mirror an online retail checkout\nexperience. Here are five e-commerce best practices you can adopt to improve\nyour candidate experience, fill your recruiting pipeline, and streamline your\nhiring flow.\n\n## 1\\. Create a seamless online application process\n\nThe ideal e-commerce experience is frictionless, and your recruiting process\nshould be frictionless for candidates, too. The job application is your first\nchance to make a positive impression on top talent and demonstrate that you\u2019re\na cutting-edge employer. An overly complex or confusing application process\nconveys a poor impression of your organization, reflects an outdated approach\nto corporate hiring, and could deter qualified candidates.\n\nTo put it very simply: Think about creating a resume or application submission\nflow that\u2019s as easy to finish as it is to order pizza delivery online. Your\napplication should flow seamlessly and intuitively, with clear, easy-to-follow\ndirections. To improve performance, e-commerce sites constantly test content\nand form flows. Consider refining your application process using the same\nmindset, and focus on improving your user experience based on quantifiable\nmetrics.\n\n## Win top talent with a frictionless hiring experience\n\nGet the checklist\n\n## 2\\. Minimize manual steps\n\nChecking out on a retail website is typically a three-step process\u2014review the\nshopping cart, provide payment information, and place the order. How many\nclicks, pages, or steps must your candidates complete to apply for a position?\nReducing the number of manual steps required to \u201ccheck out\u201d can increase\nengagement and keep qualified candidates in the funnel.\n\nKeep in mind that candidates with advanced degrees and experience working in\ntech may be turned off by lengthy or redundant applications. Many companies\nare adopting the \u201cone-click apply\u201d approach for positions where just a resume\nor LinkedIn profile is sufficient for initial candidate vetting. Look for ways\nto shorten your application process, like ATS integrations that minimize\nclicks to apply, eliminating redundant questions in favor of resume-only\napplications, and utilizing low-lift features like \u201cyes or no\u201d questions,\ndropdowns, and checkboxes.\n\n## 3\\. Embrace mobile-first functionality\n\nBusy professionals have limited time for job hunting and don\u2019t want to use\ntheir work computers for job applications. Skilled tech workers on the hunt\nfor their next opportunity may spend any spare minute scrolling job postings\non their phone. If your listings and applications aren\u2019t designed for mobile\naccess, you risk candidates taking one look and moving on.\n\nUse a mobile-first approach to job application and messaging design so\ncandidates can complete applications, communicate with your talent acquisition\nteam, and check the status of their application on their phones at any time.\nMobile functionality means greater privacy and convenience\u2014and that means a\nbetter candidate experience.\n\n## Make your hiring flow as effortless as online shopping\n\nGet the checklist\n\n## 4\\. Automate communication and notifications\n\nJust as online shoppers are notified when their order has been placed,\nshipped, or delayed, job candidates want to know how their application is\nprogressing. The best candidates typically have multiple options; if they\ndon\u2019t hear from you, they may accept another job offer or lose interest.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools can help keep candidates informed by\nautomating tasks like application status notifications, scheduling interviews,\nproviding ETAs for background checks, and reminding candidates to complete\nimportant steps like signing consent forms. Recruitment and onboarding is one\nof the top three areas where HR professionals believe AI can deliver immediate\nvalue, according to Workday\u2019s Global CHRO AI Indicator Report. Increased\nproductivity is the top benefit respondents expect to see, translating to\nreduced time to fill positions and faster conversion of top talent.\n\n## 5\\. Provide multiple channels for customer service\n\nE-commerce shoppers expect robust customer service options from retailers; job\ncandidates expect the same from you. Provide multiple customer service formats\nso candidates can get help in the way they prefer.\n\nFor example, create FAQs to answer common questions or a library of quick how-\nto articles to guide users through the application process. When candidates\nneed more help, they should have access to live customer support teams via\nphone, email, or chat. You can also give candidates access to a dedicated\nportal or account they can use to check on application status. Making the\nsupport experience feel personal and customized also goes a long way toward\ncreating a positive impression of your brand and company culture.\n\n## Checkr helps you create a frictionless candidate experience\n\nThe tech job market is highly competitive, but delivering a frictionless\ncandidate experience can help you land top-tier candidates.
