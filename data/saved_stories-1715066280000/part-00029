This\ncoupling can be enhanced using optical tools including high finesse cavities,\nallowing exquisite control of quantum degrees of freedom of individual atoms\nin the domain of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Applying these precision\noptical tools to condensed matter systems presents an opportunity to unlock a\nwide array of optically-enhanced materials for QI applications, both in the\ncontext of externally driven systems, and systems where the cavity-vacuum\ndirectly influences materials properties. Of particular interest is the regime\nof strong light-matter coupling where hybrid systems emerge that inherit\nuseful properties from both their light and matter constituents.\n\nQUAMELEON seeks to push the boundaries of optical control of solid-state\nmaterials, extending established Floquet engineering techniques to regimes\nwhere material properties can meaningfully be changed by electromagnetic\nfields at the few-photon level or by cavity-enhanced vacuum modes. Examples\ninclude new phases of matter and out-of-equilibrium effects. Of particular\ninterest are systems where engineered light-matter coupling can be used to\nenhance or quantify the inter-particle interactions and correlations in a\nmaterial. QUAMELEON seeks to discover new physics insights that can be\nexploited for QI devices such as quantum enhanced sensors, light sources or\ndetectors, transducers, and quantum emulators.\n\nThis ARC Opportunity is soliciting ideas to explore the following question:\nHow can engineered light-matter coupling be used to control or enhance quantum\nmaterials by harnessing vacuum effects or few-photon external drives?\n\nView the QUAMELEON Opportunity on SAM.gov by selecting the Topic 7: QUAntum\nMaterials Engineering using eLEctrOmagNetic fields (QUAMELEON) link under\nSolicitation on the right.\n\nThis ARC Opportunity is issued under the umbrella ARC Exploration Announcement\n(EA), DARPA-EA-24-01.

In 1983, DARPA set out to\nminiaturize them, leading to a much broader adoption of GPS capability.\n\nPaving the Way to the Modern Internet\n\nARPA research played a central role in launching the Information Revolution.\nThe agency developed and furthered much of the conceptual basis for the\nARPANET\u2014prototypical communications network launched nearly half a century\nago\u2014and invented the digital protocols that gave birth to the Internet.\n\n  * About Us\n  * About DARPA\n  * People\n  * Offices\n  * Innovation Timeline\n  * Testimony\n  * Budget and Finance\n  * History list page\n  * Image Gallery\n\n  * Our Research\n  * Coronavirus: DARPA Response\n  * Ethical Legal Societal Implications of Research\n  * Fundamental Research: Seeds of Surprise\n  * Voices from DARPA\n  * Our Programs\n\n  * News\n\n  * Events\n\n  * Work With Us\n  * Opportunities\n  * DARPAConnect\n  * DARPA Innovation Fellowship\n  * New Program Managers\n  * Contract Management\n  * Public Release\n  * For Industry\n  * For Small Businesses\n  * For Universities\n  * For Government and Military\n  * Employment at DARPA\n\n  * Site Info\n  * Sitemap\n  * Cookie Disclaimer\n\n  * Web Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Accessibility/Section 508\n  * No Fear Act\n  * Whistleblower Protection Act\n  * Usage Policy\n  * DoD Hotline\n\n  * USA.gov\n  * /\n  * Freedom of Information Act\n  * /\n  * Privacy and Civil Liberties\n  * /\n  * Visitor Information\n  * /\n  * Contact Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * Linked In\n  * RSS\n\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency 675 North Randolph Street Arlington,\nVA 22203-2114 703.526.6630\n\nThis is an official U.S. Department of Defense website sponsored by the\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\nYou are now leaving the DARPA.mil website that is under the control and\nmanagement of DARPA.
