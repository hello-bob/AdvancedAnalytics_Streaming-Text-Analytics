It can boost sales, cut costs, prevent fraud, streamline manufacturing,\nand strengthen health care.\n\nBut ML initiatives routinely fail to deliver returns \u2014 or fail to deploy\nentirely. They stall before deploying, and at great cost. One of the major\nissues is that companies tend to focus more on the technology than how it\nshould deploy. This is like being more excited about the development of a\nrocket than its launch.\n\nIn this article, I offer an antidote: a six-step practice for ushering machine\nlearning projects from conception to deployment that I call bizML. This\nframework is an effort to establish an updated, industry-standard playbook for\nrunning successful ML projects that is pertinent and compelling to both\nbusiness professionals and data professionals.\n\n## Shifting a Misplaced Focus \u2014 from Technology to Deployment\n\nML\u2019s problem is in its popularity. For all the hoopla about the core\ntechnology, the gritty details of how its deployment improves business\noperations are often glossed over. In this way, ML is now too hot for its own\ngood. After decades of consulting and running ML conferences, the lesson has\nsunk in.\n\nToday\u2019s hype about ML is overzealous because it feeds a common misconception:\nthe ML fallacy. It goes like this: Since ML algorithms can successfully\ngenerate models that hold up for new, unseen situations (which is both amazing\nand true), their models are intrinsically valuable (which is not necessarily\ntrue). The value of ML comes only when it creates organizational change \u2014 that\nis, when an ML-generated model is deployed to actively improve operations.\nUntil a model is used to actively reshape how your organization works, it\u2019s\nuse-less \u2014 literally. A model doesn\u2019t solve any business problems on its own\nand it ain\u2019t gonna deploy itself. ML can be the disruptive technology it\u2019s\ncracked up to be, but only if you disrupt with it.\n\nUnfortunately, businesses often fail to bridge the business/tech \u201cculture\ngap,\u201d a disconnect between data scientists and business stakeholders that\nprecludes deployment and leads to models collecting dust. On the one hand,\ndata scientists, who perform the model development step, fixate solely on data\nscience and generally prefer to not be bothered with \u201cmundane\u201d managerial\nactivities. Often, they take the deployment of their model for granted and\njump past a rigorous business process that would engage stakeholders to\ncollaboratively plan for deployment.\n\nOn the other hand, many business professionals \u2014 especially those already\ninclined to forgo the particulars as \u201ctoo technical\u201d \u2014 have been seduced into\nseeing this stunning technology as a panacea that solves problems on its own.\nThey defer to data scientists for any project specifics. But when they\u2019re\nultimately faced with the operational change that a deployed model would\nincur, it\u2019s a tough sell. Taken off-guard, the stakeholder hesitates before\naltering operations that are key to the company\u2019s profitability.\n\nWith no one taking proactive ownership, the hose and the faucet fail to\nconnect. Far too often, the data scientist delivers a viable model, but the\noperational team isn\u2019t ready for the pass and they drop the ball. There are\nwonderful exceptions and glowing successes, but the generally poor track\nrecord we witness today forewarns of broad disillusionment with ML \u2014 even a\ndreaded AI winter.\n\n## The Solution: BizML\n\nThe remedy is to rigorously plan for deployment from the inception of each ML\nproject. Laying the groundwork for the operational change that deployment\nwould bring to fruition takes more preaching, socializing, cross-disciplinary\ncollaboration, and change-management panache than many, including myself,\ninitially realized.\n\nTo accomplish this, a knowledgeable team must collaboratively follow an end-\nto-end practice that begins by backward planning for deployment. As I\nmentioned above, I call this practice bizML and it consists of the following\nsix steps.\n\n### 1\\. Establish the deployment goal.\n\nDefine the business value proposition: how ML will affect operations in order\nto improve them (i.e., operationalization or implementation).\n\nExample: UPS predicts which destination addresses will receive a package\ndelivery in order to plan a more efficient delivery process.\n\n### 2\\. Establish the prediction goal.\n\nDefine what the ML model will predict for each individual case. Each detail\nmatters from a business perspective.\n\nExample: For each destination, how many packages across how many stops will be\nrequired tomorrow? For example, a group of three office buildings with 24\nbusiness suites at 123 Main St. will require two stops with three packages\neach by 8:30 a.m.\n\n### 3\\. Establish the evaluation metrics.\n\nDetermine the salient benchmarks to track during both model training and model\ndeployment and determine what performance level must be achieved for the\nproject to be considered a success.\n\nExamples: Miles driven, gallons of fuel consumed, tons of carbon emitted, and\nstops-per-mile (the more densely a route is packed with deliveries, the more\nvalue is generated from each mile of driving).\n\n### 4\\. Prepare the data.\n\nDefine what the training data must look like and get it into that form.\n\nExample: Assemble a large number of positive and negative examples from which\nto learn \u2013 both destinations that did receive deliveries on certain days and\nothers that did not.\n\n### 5\\. Train the model.\n\nGenerate a predictive model from the data. The model is the thing that\u2019s\n\u201clearned.\u201d\n\nExamples: decision trees, logistic regression, neural networks, and ensemble\nmodels.\n\n### 6\\. Deploy the model.\n\nUse the model to render predictive scores (probabilities) \u2014 thereby applying\nwhat\u2019s been learned to new cases \u2014 and then act on those scores to improve\nbusiness operations.\n\nExample: By accounting for predicted packages along with known packages, UPS\nimproved its system that assigns packages to delivery trucks at shipping\ncenters. This improvement annually saves an estimated 18.5 million miles, $35\nmillion, 800,000 gallons of fuel, and 18,500 metric tons of emissions.\n\nThese six steps define a business practice that charts a shrewd path to ML\ndeployment. Anyone who wishes to participate in ML projects must be familiar\nwith them, no matter whether they\u2019re in a business or technical role.\n\nAfter culminating with step 6, deployment, you have finished...starting\nsomething new. BizML only begins an ongoing journey, a new phase of running\nimproved operations \u2014 and of keeping things working. Once launched, a model\nrequires upkeep: monitoring it, maintaining it, and periodically refreshing\nit.\n\nFollowing these six steps in this order is almost a logical inevitability. To\nunderstand why, let\u2019s start with the end. The final two culminating steps,\nsteps 5 and 6, are the two main steps of ML, model training and deployment.\nBizML ushers the project through to their completion.\n\nThe step just before those two \u2014 Step 4: Prepare the data \u2014 is a known\nrequirement that always precedes model training. You must provide ML software\nwith data in the right form in order for it to work. That step has always been\nan integral part of modeling projects, ever since linear regression was first\napplied by businesses in the 1960s.\n\nBefore the technical magic, you must perform business magic. That\u2019s where the\nfirst three steps come in. They establish a greatly needed \u201cpreproduction\u201d\nphase of pitching, socializing, and collaborating in order to jointly agree on\nhow ML will be deployed and how its performance will be evaluated.\nImportantly, these first steps go much further than only agreeing on a\nproject\u2019s business objective. They ask business professionals to dive into the\nmechanics that define exactly how predictions will alter operations \u2014 and they\nask data scientists to reach beyond their usual sphere and work closely with\nbusiness-side personnel. This cross-disciplinary team is uniquely equipped to\nnavigate to a deployment plan that is both technically feasible and\noperationally viable.\n\n## Bringing Business Stakeholders into the Fold\n\nFollowing all six of the steps of the bizML practice is uncommon, but hardly\nunheard of. Many ML projects succeed wildly, even if they\u2019re in the minority.\nWhile a well-known, established framework has been a long time coming, the\nideas at the heart of the bizML framework are not new to many experienced data\nscientists.\n\nAnd yet the folks who need it the most \u2014 business leaders and other business\nstakeholders \u2014 are least likely to be familiar with it. In fact, the business\nworld in general has yet to become aware of even the need for a specialized\nbusiness practice in the first place. This is understandable, since the common\nnarrative leads them astray. AI is often oversold as an impenetrable yet\nexciting cure-all. Meanwhile, many data scientists far prefer to crunch\nnumbers than to take pains to elucidate.\n\nFirst things first: Business professionals need some edification. Before those\nin charge can participate in the bizML practice and, ultimately, green-light\nmodel deployment with confidence, they must gain a concrete understanding of\nhow an ML project works from end to end: What will the model predict?\nPrecisely how will those predictions affect operations? Which metric\nmeaningfully tracks how well it predicts? and What kind of data is needed?\nThis isn\u2019t the \u201crocket science\u201d part, but it\u2019s still a modest book\u2019s worth.\n\nConsidering the innumerable dollars and resources pumped into ML, how much\nmore potential value could we capture by adopting a universal procedure that\nfacilitates the collaboration and planning needed to reach deployment? Let\u2019s\nfind out.\n\nThis article is adapted from the book, The AI Playbook: Mastering the Rare Art\nof Machine Learning Deployment, with permission from the publisher, MIT Press.\nIt is a product of the author\u2019s work while he held a one-year position as the\nBodily Bicentennial Professor in Analytics at the UVA Darden School of\nBusiness.\n\nNew!\n\nHBR Learning\n\nDigital Intelligence Course\n\nAccelerate your career with Harvard ManageMentor\u00ae.
