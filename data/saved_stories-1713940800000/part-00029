Introducing: WEB AWESOME.\n\nThere\u2019s less than 48 hours for you to be a part of the Kickstarter and help us\nmake this open source project even more awesome!\n\nJust during the Kickstarter, lock in your Web Awesome Pro AND get a Font\nAwesome Pro subscriptions at 50% off!\n\nWeb Awesome is the fancy pants new name for Shoelace, the most popular free\nand open source web components library. (Shoelace and its creator, Cory\nLaViska, joined Font Awesome back in 2022.)\n\nDrop Web Awesome components into any site, and they\u2019ll just work. Since\nthey\u2019re built using web standards, no JavaScript frameworks are required. But\nWeb Awesome works great with them all!\n\nShoelace \u2013> Web Awesome\n\nWeb Awesome provides a collection of meticulously designed, highly\ncustomizable UI components built on framework agnostic technology. Why spend\nhundreds of hours (or more) building a design system from scratch? Why make a\ncomponent library that only works with one framework?\n\nWith Web Awesome, you can:\n\n  * Start building faster (no need to roll your own buttons)\n  * Build multiple apps with different frameworks that share the same UI components\n  * Fully customize components to match your existing designs\n  * Adopt components incrementally Incrementally as needed (no need to ditch your framework)\n  * Upgrade or switch frameworks without rebuilding foundational components\n\nVersion 3.0 now comes with more Awesome than ever before, including improved\naccessibility, usability, and performance. AND our new theming API makes it\neasier than ever to manually theme your components.\n\nAdding components is super easy!\n\nWeb Awesome, like Shoelace before it, contains a large library of the most\ncommonly needed web components. And there are even more planned as part of the\nKickstarter.\n\nStop starting projects from scratch and build better with Web Awesome.\n\nWeb Awesome Pro is the design system platform that makes it easier to ship\nwebsites, projects, and apps faster. It includes everything in Web Awesome\nFree, plus Pro-only web components, a theme builder, pattern library, and all-\nnew layout components.\n\nOur Pro Theme Builder lets you quickly build your brand as a custom theme,\nincluding your logo, typography, and icons (including Font Awesome Pro). And\nusing just a single color, we\u2019ll help you get your own fully accessible, fully\nunique color palette. And if you ever create a new logo or even undertake a\nfull re-brand, the Pro Theme Builder makes it just as easy the second time to\nget a completely new look and feel for your website, project, or app.\n\nEverything is possible,\n\nEven the impossible!\n\nEvery knob, lever, and dial is yours to command!\n\nOur Pro Pattern Library, with copy-and-paste code snippets, means you never\nhave to build sites completely from scratch. Our patterns are designed from\nthe ground up for the best usability AND accessibility so you have lots of\ngreat starting points for your next project. PLUS, you and your team will have\naccess to your own themed and hosted documentation, so you can stay on the\nsame page and work faster.\n\nA sneak peek at some of the patterns that will be available when Web Awesome\nPro launches \u2013 from e-commerce sites to personal blogs, we have you covered.\n\nOur Pro Layout Components give you an easy responsive layout engine for\nmobile, desktop, and everything in between.\n\nThe <wa-page> component handles structural page elements positioning, so you\ndon\u2019t have to.\n\nResponsive behavior comes built-in with the <wa-page> component.\n\nAt this super-low, Kickstarter-only price, if you save just a quarter of an\nhour every month, Web Awesome Pro will have paid for itself.\n\nSo back the Web Awesome Pro Kickstarter, ship faster, and build better\ntogether.\n\nWe\u2019ve got lots more info over on the Web Awesome Kickstarter, including:\n\n  * Demo Videos\n  * Project Timeline\n  * Rewards\n  * Swag & Add-Ons\n  * Stretch Goals & Progress\n  * License details for WA Free and WA Pro\n\n## So, please support and thanks for putting the Awesome in Web Awesome!\n\nThere\u2019s less than 48 hours for you to be a part of the Kickstarter and help us\nmake this open source project be even more awesome!
