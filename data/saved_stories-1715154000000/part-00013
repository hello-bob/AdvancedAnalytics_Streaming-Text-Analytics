After all, it is not often that Serbia finds itself as part of a\nthree-stop tour by an international leader of such stature.\n\nBut Serbia has been deepening its relationship with China in recent years,\neven as it continues with negotiations to join the European Union.\n\nMr Xi is likely to use his trip to highlight his criticisms of Nato. His visit\ncoincides with the 25th anniversary of the US airstrikes on China\u2019s embassy in\nBelgrade. And in an editorial for the Serbian newspaper, Politika, the\npresident made it clear that feelings over that incident still run high.\n\n\u201cWe should never forget,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Chinese people cherish peace, but we\nwill never allow such tragic history to repeat itself.\u201d\n\nThat kind of rhetoric resonates in Serbia, where the vast majority of people\noppose Nato membership. That is a key factor in why this stop on Mr Xi\u2019s\nEuropean tour makes perfect sense.\n\nOliver Bunic/Bloomberg\n\nNato's 1999 bombing campaign was aimed at pushing Serb forces out of Kosovo\n\nCommercial connections are also a factor. The two countries signed a free\ntrade agreement last year, building on a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d\nin 2016 \u2013 the year of Mr Xi\u2019s previous visit to Serbia.\n\nChina now claims to be the largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI)\nin Serbia. Its ambassador, Li Ming, says that Hisense, along with mining\ncompany Zijin and tyre manufacturer Linglong, provide 20,000.\n\nUN trade figures actually put China in fifth place on the foreign direct\ninvestment list, behind Germany, Italy, the US and Russia.\n\nNonetheless, the Chinese investments are eye-catching \u2013 and only likely to\nincrease. Serbia has just taken delivery of its first Chinese electric high-\nspeed trains. They will eventually run alongside Swiss-made rolling stock on\nthe Belgrade-Budapest railway, which is being reconstructed with Chinese\nexpertise and finance.\n\nAnd that is just the start. Serbia\u2019s infrastructure minister, Goran Vesic,\nsays Chinese partners will work on other infrastructure, including roads,\nbridges, tunnels and sewage. \u201cThere is really a lot of room for co-operation\nwith Chinese companies,\u201d he told Serbia\u2019s national broadcaster, RTS.\n\nNo wonder Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vucic, is planning to personally\nserve the finest wines his country has to offer to his Chinese counterpart\nduring a banquet in Mr Xi\u2019s honour.\n\nReuters/Aur\u00e9lien Morissard\n\nXi Jinping was treated to a wet day in the Pyrenees at the end of his French\nvisit\n\nNoting that within five years Serbian wine will face no import tariffs in\nChina, Mr Vucic told China Central Television that Serbian wines were \u201cnot as\nexpensive as [those] in France\u201d and that he believed Mr Xi was \u201cgoing to like\u201d\nhis selections.\n\nThis was perhaps a gentle dig at Emmanuel Macron, who hosted Mr Xi for the\nfirst stop on his European trip. The French president\u2019s offering was a bottle\nof R\u00e9my Martin Louis XIII cognac, which would cost the best part of \u20ac5,000 in\nBelgrade.\n\nA trip to the Pyrenees was also included in the charm offensive \u2013 to sweeten\npleas by Mr Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for\nMr Xi to ensure more balanced trade with Europe and influence Russia\u2019s\nPresident Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter Belgrade, the next stop for China\u2019s president will be Budapest, where he\nwill meet his strongest ally among the leaders of EU member states, Hungarian\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\nChinese investments are also a strong factor there \u2013 with a factory for\nelectric car giant BYD among the projects that buttress Mr Orban\u2019s resistance\nto the EU consensus on everything from migration to providing arms to Ukraine.\n\n## Ukraine, brandy and EVs top the agenda on Xi's charm offensive\n\n## Hungary opens up to Chinese tech despite protests\n\n## Nato and Serbia put bombing behind them\n\nEurope\n\nXi Jinping\n\nFrance\n\nSerbia\n\nChina\n\nEmmanuel Macron\n\nRelated\n\n## It's a heavy year to be in Eurovision - Bambie Thug\n\n3 hrs ago\n\nWorld\n\n## Gun and motorbike seized after man shot dead\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\n## Polish security finds cabinet meeting room bugged\n\n10 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\nMore\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## Can TikTok's owner afford to lose its killer app?\n\nSell or be banned - TikTok's US operations, by some estimates, could fetch up\nto $100bn.\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nChina\n\n9 hrs ago\n\n## State involvement not ruled out in hack - Shapps\n\nThe details of serving Army, RAF and Navy personnel are involved, the BBC\nunderstands.\n\n9 hrs ago\n\nUK\n\n17 hrs ago\n\n## China hospital stabbing leaves at least two dead\n\nSeveral others are injured following the incident in the south-western Yunnan\nprovince.\n\n17 hrs ago\n\nChina\n\n21 hrs ago\n\n## Child 'scared' as Sikh swords removed on Eurostar\n\nThe Sikh Federation says the policy \"stinks of racism\".\n\n21 hrs ago\n\nBeds, Herts & Bucks\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Ukraine, brandy and EVs top the agenda on Xi's charm offensive\n\nXi Jinping is on his first visit to Europe in five years - and it feels much\nlike a charm offensive.\n\n2 days ago\n\nWorld\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": true}
