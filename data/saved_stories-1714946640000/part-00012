AI presents immense challenges and opportunities, an\nexplosion of new applications, and quickly evolving threats \u2013 making it more\nimportant than ever that the cybersecurity community collaborates to stay\nahead of bad actors.\n\nAs nearly 50,000 security practitioners prepare to attend RSA 2024, here\u2019s a\nlook at how AI will dominate and shape the conversation, as well as how the\nrecent SEC guidelines are changing the roles of the CISO, the C-suite, and\nboard members.\n\n### On the Frontlines of the AI Revolution\n\nAt last year\u2019s RSA, there was a lot of buzz about whether AI was going to be\nthe next big thing in cybersecurity and how to move past the hype. As we\napproach RSA 2024, large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) have\nnow not only arrived \u2013 they will fuel much of the conversation this year.\n\nWith so much to consider around the convergence of AI and risk management, I\u2019m\nexpecting lively debates about the double-edged sword presented by this\nburgeoning technology.\n\nAs my colleagues and I discuss how to protect companies from AI-empowered dark\noperators by leveraging that same technology to augment our defenses, here are\nsome themes I expect to surface at RSA.\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\n### How AI Empowers Hackers and Malicious Attackers\n\nWith physical security incidents costing companies $1 trillion in 2022, AI-\npowered cyberattacks continue to exhibit greater sophistication, speed, and\nadaptability. While this makes them harder to detect and mitigate, offerings\nlike DarkGPT and FraudGPT are making it even easier for bad actors to cause\nharm without needing any coding skills.\n\nAI algorithms can turn vast amounts of data from social media and other\nsources into highly targeted and convincing phishing attacks or other forms of\nsocial engineering. Amid the race to harness generative AI, for example,\nhackers are already exploiting casual users with fake ChatGPT websites and\nphishing scams that mimic the real site. When these attacks are played on\nunsuspecting employees, they can provide unauthorized access to critical\nsystems.\n\nAt the same time, in the rush to market, legitimate GenAI clients often fail\nto include security as a priority while developing apps. With offerings like\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini susceptible to attack, early adopters are augmenting their\nworkforce with third-party apps that leave them vulnerable \u2013 which means\nemployees may willingly expose sensitive company information without even\nknowing it.\n\nAs the cybersecurity community learns to defend against a cascade of AI-\npowered attacks, the technology will only embolden bad actors. Our teams will\nbe faced with increasingly higher-level Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and\nmore sophisticated and evasive malware that is capable of infiltrating and\nmanipulating industrial control systems with greater precision and speed.\n\n### How AI Empowers Cybersecurity Defenders\n\nIn AI\u2019s accelerating world, the challenge before security leaders is growing\nfaster than ever. Thankfully, we are armed with the same technology, and we\ncan leverage AI-powered solutions to fortify our defenses and create a\nproactive campaign against bad actors.\n\nBy incorporating AI/ML-type models into security programs, our cybersecurity\nteams access a deeper understanding of our data and expose risks we would\notherwise miss. When paired with automation, AI tools can sift through massive\ndatasets, compare data cluster behaviors, and respond to potential hazards\nbefore their human counterparts, quickly isolating exposed systems from the\ncompany\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, just as bad actors are using GenAI to craft stronger, more\ndeceptive threats, companies can use the technology to build proactive\ntraining scenarios. In this controlled environment, teams can practice, test,\nand improve their defenses so they are prepared for a myriad of real attacks.\nOn a more day-to-day basis, GenAI can be implemented to empower CISOs to ask\nquestions about their program using natural language and receive accurate\nanswers with predictive insights.\n\nWhile employee training and education remain essential, beating today\u2019s cyber\ncriminals requires robust and evolving technical defenses \u2013 and the SEC\u2019s\nrecent regulations reflect the significance of this battle.\n\n### The New Role of Cybersecurity Executives\n\nThe SEC\u2019s 4-day disclosure rule presents a significant new challenge for\nbusinesses \u2013 one that ties directly back to the AI conversation. AI can help\nwith early detection warnings and faster response times to identify breaches\nwell within that window.\n\nAt the same time, the SEC also requires public companies to share material\ninformation regarding their cybersecurity risk management measures on an\nannual basis. This creates a need for clear visibility of historical data.\n\nWith increasing responsibilities, today\u2019s CISOs are not necessarily in the\ntrenches as they once were. They are more likely to be observing their program\nfrom a higher perspective, enabling them to take a more holistic approach to\ntheir cyber defense strategy and direct their teams with actionable data-\ninformed intelligence.\n\nEmbracing AI/ML is critical for CISOs to achieve this holistic view and help\nanalyze the vast amount of data they need to sift through.\n\n### Exploring the \u2018Art of Possible,\u2019 Together, at RSA 2024\n\nWith AI\u2019s capacities seeming to accelerate at breakneck speed, it is\ncontinuously opening new possibilities \u2013 on both sides of the divide. To stay\nahead of empowered bad actors and shape a resilient and adaptable ecosystem,\nthe cybersecurity community must work together to uncover and embrace the art\nof possible in risk management and threat defense \u2013 which is why I am looking\nforward to exploring RSA 2024 and collaborating to identify solutions and\nstrategies that will help us continue to shape a safer world.\n\nPhoto credit: Headway on Unsplash\n\nRecent Articles By Author\n\n  * ChatGPT Empowers Millions of Potential Cyberattackers\n\nMore from Sivan Tehila\n\nMay 2, 2024May 2, 2024 Sivan Tehila AI, Cybersecurity, predictions, rsa, RSA\nConference, trends\n\n  * \u2190 Kaseya Connect Global 2024 Day Two Recap: Embracing AI and Autonomous Automation\n  * Why CAPTCHAs Are Not the Future of Bot Detection \u2192\n\n#### Sivan Tehila\n\nSivan Tehila is a cybersecurity expert and entrepreneur, and the founder and\nCEO of Onyxia Cyber.
