The Country Music Hall of\nFamer had to relearn how to walk, spell and read in the years that followed. A\ncondition called aphasia limits his ability to speak \u2014 it\u2019s why his wife Mary\nTravis assists him in interviews. It\u2019s also why he hasn\u2019t released new music\nin over a decade, until now.\n\n\u201cWhere That Came From,\u201d which released Friday, is a rich acoustic ballad\namplified by Travis\u2019 immediately recognizable, soulful vocal tone.\n\nCris Lacy, Warner Music Nashville co-president, approached Randy and Mary\nTravis and asked: \u201c\u2018What if we could take Randy\u2019s voice and recreate it using\nAI?,\u2019\u201d Mary Travis told The Associated Press over Zoom last week, Randy\nsmiling in agreement right next to her. \u201cWell, we were all over that, so we\nwere so excited.\u201d\n\n0:00 / 45\n\n# AP AUDIO: With help from AI, Randy Travis got his voice back. Here\u2019s how his\nfirst song post-stroke came to be\n\nAP correspondent Margie Szaroleta reports on Randy Travis recording a new\nsingle with artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cAll I ever wanted since the day of a stroke was to hear that voice again.\u201d\n\nLacy tapped developers in London to create a proprietary AI model to begin the\nprocess. The result was two models: One with 12 vocal stems (or song samples),\nand another with 42 stems collected across Travis\u2019 career \u2014 from 1985 to 2013,\nsays Kyle Lehning, Travis\u2019 longtime producer. Lacy and Lehning chose to use\n\u201cWhere That Came From,\u201d a song written by Scotty Emerick and John Scott\nSherrill that Lehning co-produced and held on to for years. He believed it\ncould best articulate the humanity of Travis\u2019 idiosyncratic vocal style.\n\n\u201cI never even thought about another song,\u201d Lehning said.\n\nOnce he input the demo vocal (sung by James Dupree) into the AI models, \u201cit\ntook about five minutes to analyze,\u201d says Lehning. \u201cI really wish somebody had\nbeen here with a camera because I was the first person to hear it. And it was\nstunning, to me, how good it was sort of right off the bat. It\u2019s hard to put\nan equation around it, but it was probably 70, 75% what you hear now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were certain aspects of it that were not authentic to Randy\u2019s\nperformance,\u201d he said, so he began to edit and build on the recording with\nengineer Casey Wood, who also worked closely with Travis over a few decades.\n\nThe pair cherrypicked from the two models, and made alterations to things like\nvibrato speed, or slowing and relaxing phrases. \u201cRandy is a laid-back singer,\u201d\nLehning says. \u201cRandy, in my opinion, had an old soul quality to his voice.\nThat\u2019s one of the things that made him unique, but also, somehow familiar.\u201d\n\nHis vocal performance on \u201cWhere That Came From\u201d had to reflect that fact.\n\n\u201cWe were able to just improve on it,\u201d Lehning says of the AI recording. \u201cIt\nwas emotional, and it\u2019s still emotional.\u201d\n\nMary Travis says the \u201chuman element,\u201d and \u201cthe people that are involved\u201d in\nthis project, separate it from more nefarious uses of AI in music.\n\n\u201cRandy, I remember watching him when he first heard the song after it was\ncompleted. It was beautiful because at first, he was surprised, and then he\nwas very pensive, and he was listening and studying,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then he\nput his head down and his eyes were a little watery. I think he went through\nevery emotion there was, in those three minutes of just hearing his voice\nagain.\u201d\n\nLacy agrees. \u201cThe beauty of this is, you know, we\u2019re doing it with a voice\nthat the world knows and has heard and has been comforted by,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBut I think, just on human terms, it\u2019s a very real need. And it\u2019s a big loss\nwhen you lose the voice of someone that you were connected to, and the ability\nto have it back is a beautiful gift.\u201d\n\nThey also hope that this song will work to educate people on the good that AI\ncan do \u2014 not the fraudulent activities that so frequently make headlines.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that maybe we can set a standard,\u201d Mary Travis says, where\ncredit is given where credit is due \u2014 and artists have control over their\nvoice and work.\n\nLast month, over 200 artists signed an open letter submitted by the Artist\nRights Alliance non-profit, calling on artificial intelligence tech companies,\ndevelopers, platforms, digital music services and platforms to stop using AI\n\u201cto infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d Artists who co-\nsigned included Stevie Wonder, Miranda Lambert, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj,\nPeter Frampton, Katy Perry, Smokey Robinson and J Balvin.\n\nSo, now that \u201cWhere That Came From\u201d is here, will there be more original Randy\nTravis songs in the future?\n\n\u201cThere may be others,\u201d says Mary Travis. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where this goes. This is\nsuch a foreign territory. There\u2019s likely more on the horizon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do have other tracks,\u201d says Lacy, but Warner Music is being as selective.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a stunt, and it\u2019s not a parlor trick,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was\nimportant to have a song worthy of him.\u201d\n\n## ___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct one instance of the song title \u201cWhere\nThat Came From,\u201d instead of \u201cWhat That Came From.\u201d\n\nMARIA SHERMAN\n\nMusic Journalist\n\ntwitter\n\nmailto\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nA man tried to shoot a pastor during a church service but his gun wouldn't\nfire, state police say\n\nUndo\n\nTreppenlift-VergleichAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Rentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-\nVergleich:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUndo\n\nMedicare and Social Security go-broke dates are pushed back in a 'measure of\ngood news'\n\nUndo\n\nPennsylvania man convicted of kidnapping a woman, driving her to a Nevada\ndesert and suffocating her\n\nUndo\n\nColorado school bus aide shown hitting autistic boy faces more charges\n\nUndo\n\nJudge says gun found in car of Myon Burrell, sentenced to life as teen, can be\nevidence in new caseA judge has ruled that the traffic stop of a Minnesota man\nwas justified, so the results of a search that found drugs and a gun in his\nSUV will be allowed as evidence.AP News\n\nUndo\n\nNo, France did not deploy troops to fight with Ukraine against RussiaSocial\nmedia users are pointing to the blog post as proof that French troops have\nbeen sent to fight Russia alongside Ukraine as the war continues in its third\nyear.AP News\n\nUndo\n\nAd Content\n\nAdvertisement: verbraucher-zeitung.de\n\nJapaner putzen nicht, sie machen dies (Es ist genial!)Advertisement:\nverbraucher-zeitung.de\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Solar Vergleich\n\nRentner aus Sachsen entdeckt \"Solar-Erfindung\" - Industrie\nsprachlosAdvertisement: Solar Vergleich\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Treppenlift-Vergleich\n\nKein Scherz: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsAdvertisement: Treppenlift-\nVergleich\n\nUndo\n\nAd Content\n\nAdvertisement: Solar Vergleich\n\nRentner entdeckt \"Solar-Erfindung\" und revolutioniert den Strom-\nMarktAdvertisement: Solar Vergleich\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Solaranlagen\n\nWas kostet eine Solaranlage mit Speicher 2024?Advertisement: Solaranlagen\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Photovoltaik-Angebotsvergleich\n\nStromkonzerne verschweigen: \"Wer ein Haus in Sachsen hat sollte Nicht\n...\"Advertisement: Photovoltaik-Angebotsvergleich\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Solaranlagen\n\nMehr sollten Solaranlagen 2024 nicht kosten...Solarstrom lohnt sich:\nStromspeicher & staatliche F\u00f6rderung machen es m\u00f6glichAdvertisement:\nSolaranlagen\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Gesund im Alter Magazin\n\nCOPD ist nicht heilbar.
