After a series of small strokes and then a broken hip, Joe\nDesch, a man of iron independence, was forced to recuperate in a Kettering\nnursing home. There he took with him the painful secret he had kept coiled\ninside for most of his life.\n\n\"He seemed still to be fighting battles that should have been settled years\nago,\" Anderson said. \"There were little things that would set him off on\ntirades.\"\n\nAnderson knew only that her father's pain and anger were tied to the World War\nII codebreaking research he had done at Dayton's National Cash Register Co. \u2014\nthe work that had driven him to a nervous breakdown, but which he had never\nbeen able to talk about, not even to explain the Congressional Medal for Merit\nhe had received for his war service.\n\nBut then, one morning that summer, Anderson thought she had found a way to\nhelp her father unburden his heart. There was an article in the paper about\nthe late Capt. Joseph Rochefort, who was receiving a posthumous medal from\nPresident Ronald Reagan for cracking a World War II Japanese code and\nproviding the key to one of the U.S. Navy's greatest victories at the Battle\nof Midway.\n\n\"I went out in the morning,\" Anderson said, \"when he was brightest, and\ncheerfully handed him the clipping and asked, 'Dad, did you know this guy?\nSee, they're giving him a medal like yours \u2014 but posthumously.' \"\n\nDesch burst into a stream of invectives \"that could have been heard all over\nthe state,\" she said. \"He immediately tensed up and yelled, 'They've probably\nfound out I'm in here and have this place bugged \u2014 afraid I'll spill the\nbeans. Don't you ever dare bring that up again!' \"\n\nAnderson didn't. A year later, her father would be dead from a massive stroke.\n\nFALL 1989 It was through her 10-year-old son that Debbie Desch Anderson first\nbegan to unlock her father's mystery.\n\nJesse, her younger boy and a fourth-grader at Holy Angels, had to write a\nfamily history for school. Jesse wanted to profile his grandfather, Joseph R.\nDesch, an electrical engineer and executive at NCR, who had died two years\nbefore. The boy was fascinated by his grandfather's personal things \u2014 scads of\nold photographs, papers and memorabilia boxed up in the basement of her\nKettering home.\n\nAnderson and her son started digging through her father's items. She happened\nupon two thick transcripts she had seen before but had never bothered to read.\nThey were Desch's interviews with Henry Tropp, a historian from the\nSmithsonian Institution, dated Jan. 17 and 18, 1973.\n\nThis time Anderson began skimming the 300-plus pages of questions and answers\nin earnest, finding mostly technical stuff about Desch's role in development\nof the modern computer. But beginning on page 111 of the first-day's\ninterview, and continuing to page 119, the text had been slashed through with\na felt-tipped pen. In the margin was written: \"Delete from tape and\nmanuscript.\"\n\nThe redacted words spoke of \"an electronic cryptanalytic machine,\" of\nclassified code names, British scientists and of top-secret equipment dumped\nand buried in the middle of the night.\n\nAnderson devoured the words, hardly believing her eyes. Here at last was a\nglimmer of her father's top-secret work during WWII.\n\n\"He always said it had to do with codebreaking, and he wouldn't say anything\nmore,\" she said.\n\nAs a teen-ager and young adult, Anderson never pressed him on it, either. She\nknew her father had gone on to head the military research division at NCR\nduring the 1960s, and that's all she cared to know. \"I was a true child of the\n'60s. I was embarrassed that my father was part of the military-industrial\ncomplex,\" she said.\n\nDesch had burned the most crucial NCR war documents \u2014 but somehow had left the\ntranscripts, and those eight pages intended to be stricken from history, at\nhis home in Kettering. Now here they were, in Anderson's hands, like a thin\nray of light pointing the way to treasure deep inside a cave.\n\nFor the next decade, Anderson would try to illuminate her father's mystery,\noften finding herself at odds with national intelligence officials and\nskeptical historians. But in doing so, she would discover the historic role\nthat her father \u2014 as well as NCR and Dayton \u2014 played in shortening the world's\nmost horrible war.\n\nIn 1942 and 1943, Desch had headed a top-secret program at NCR to develop a\nhigh-speed deciphering machine, called a Bombe, to crack the Nazi submarine\ncode. The project was second in priority only to the Manhattan Project that\nbuilt the Atom Bomb, and perhaps second only to the bomb in hastening the war\nto an end.\n\nJoseph R. Desch died on Aug. 3, 1987, at age 80, with his story untold \u2014 until\nnow.\n\nWith the help of Anderson and Colin Burke \u2014 a University of Maryland history\nprofessor who first unearthed the details of the NCR project \u2014 as well as\nnewly released information from the NCR archives and dozens of interviews with\nthe men and women who built the NCR machines, the Dayton Daily News will\nrecreate those crucial months in Dayton leading up to the production of the\nNCR Bombe.\n\nJUNE 5, 1943 It was a sunny morning with just a hint of sea haze on the\nhorizon as Lt. \"Goose\" McAuslun and Lt. Richard S. Rogers flew their Navy\nwarplanes over the vast, empty reaches of the mid-Atlantic, patrolling the\nvicinity of 35 degrees North, 45 degrees West, midway between Jacksonville,\nFla., and Morocco.\n\nMcAuslun's Avenger dive bomber was armed with four depth bombs. Rogers'\nWildcat fighter bristled with high-caliber machine guns. But in the blind-\nman's game of hunting enemy submarines, the pilots had something else just as\nimportant as their weapons \u2014 reliable intelligence information locating a line\nof 17 German U-boats the area, lying in ambush for a westbound Allied convoy.\n\nThe pilots' mission: Find and kill the subs. The pair was on the last leg of a\nfive-hour patrol, 70 miles from their escort carrier U.S.S. Bogue, when\nMcAuslun spotted U-217 cruising placidly on the surface about seven miles to\ntheir right.\n\nMcAuslun signalled Rogers, who banked his Wildcat and dove, strafing the sub's\ndeck. \"He just tore off and left me in his smoke,\" McAuslun, now 81, recalled\nfrom his Henderson, N.C., home.\n\nMcAuslun followed in his tubby Avenger and released his four depth bombs at 75\nfeet, just as the sub began to dive.\n\nBut the crew of U-217 was too late. The four bombs exploded on either side of\nthe sub's hull, lifting it out of the water and splitting the hull. The sub\nsank in just 33 seconds, with Rogers blasting at it one last time to send it\non its way.\n\nIt was the first time the U.S. Navy had sunk a Nazi submarine in a purely\noffensive action. The day before, using the same intelligence, pilots from the\nBogue had damaged and scattered three other U-boats. Naval historians say\nthose two days marked a turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\nThe Navy pilots had no idea that the information guiding their mission had\noriginated from Building 26 at NCR in Dayton, where an intercepted German\nmessage had been cracked just days before. Naval intelligence had relied on a\nhigh-speed decrypting machine called a \u201cBombe\u201d \u2014 designed and manufactured in\na top-secret program at NCR. So secret, in fact, that NCR's key role in the\nAllied intelligence effort known as Ultra would not come to light until half a\ncentury later, when a 1992 directive by then-President Bill Clinton released\nmany classified documents.\n\nSince the early 1970s, much attention has been given to the early Polish and\nBritish successes in cracking the Enigma code. The Poles called their first\ndecoding machine a \"Bomba,\" perhaps after the brand of ice cream cones favored\nby the codebreakers. Operating from the famed codebreaking school at Bletchley\nPark outside of London, the Brits refined and further mechanized the device,\nbased on the theoretical work of mathematician Alan Turing. They dubbed their\ndevice a \"bombe.\"\n\nBut by the spring of 1942, the German navy was again operating in total\nsecrecy and with a vengeance, thanks to a upgrading of their Enigma machines.\nWith the British Ultra effort stumped and the Germans dispatching ever more\nsubmarines to the Atlantic Allies feared they would lose ships to the\nwolfpacks faster than they could be replaced.\n\nNorth Atlantic sinkings more than quadrupled in the last half of 1942 compared\nto the last half of 1941 \u2014 from 600,000 tons to 2.6 million tons. \"And each of\nthe nearly 500 ships sunk in those six months,\" wrote military historian David\nKahn in Seizing the Enigma, \"meant more freezing deaths in the middle of the\nocean, more widows, more fatherless children, less food for some toddler, less\nammunition for some soldier, less fuel for some plane \u2014 and the prospect of\nprolonging those miseries.\"\n\nThe Enigma was like a typewriter that encoded messages by scrambling each\nkeystroke through a series of rotors. It could generate billions upon billions\nof possible letter combinations.\n\nBut unbeknownst to the Germans, the Poles and the Brits had been able to crack\nthe three-rotor Enigma machine, relying in part on captured German documents.\nBut when the German Navy added a fourth rotor on Feb. 1, 1942, the number of\npossible combinations for producing any one letter overwhelmed their\ndecrypting abilities.\n\nUnder increasing pressure from the U.S. Navy, which had been kept in the dark\nwhile soaring numbers of its ships and sailors were lost to the wolfpacks, the\nBritish finally relinquished their control over Ultra and told the Americans\nto give it a go.\n\nWhat was needed, and in a hurry, was a high-speed decoding machine that could\nrun through all the possible Enigma combinations at heretofore unheard-of\nspeeds \u2014 a machine that the British had been working on since late 1941\nwithout success.\n\nNavy theoreticians at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology envisioned an\nall-electronic machine many times faster than the British bombe. But only two\ncompanies in the United States had the technical capability at that time to\nproduce such a marvel \u2014 IBM and Dayton's NCR. The obvious choice for the Navy\nwas NCR, where chairman of the board Col. Edward A. Deeds had a long working\nrelationship with MIT as well as the Navy's top brass. It also had idle\ncapacity \u2014 NCR, unlike IBM, had been ordered by the War Production Board to\nstop making its major product, cash registers, for the duration of the war.\n\nIn the end, the weight of the Navy\u2019s demands, and the nation's, would fall\nmost heavily on one man\u2019s shoulders \u2014 those of Joe Desch. A modest but\nbrilliant engineer, at age 35 he headed NCR's electrical research laboratory.\nDesch had already contributed to the war effort, unknowingly at the time, by\ninventing an electronic counter capable of operating at 1 million counts per\nsecond \u2014 at least 100 times faster than anything achieved before \u2014 for use in\ndeveloping the first atomic bomb.\n\nUnlike the Navy's theoretical engineers, who were mostly graduate students and\nprofessors at MIT, Desch was a floor-trained industrial genius, as savvy about\nfront-office politics as he was knowledgeable about state-of-the-art\nelectronics.\n\nThe MIT engineers \"had a very different orientation than a practical engineer\nlike Joe, but he was able to handle them all and get the job done. He was\nadored by these guys,\" said Colin Burke, former historian-in-residence at the\nNational Security Agency and uthor of Information and Secrecy, the first book\nto detail NCR's attack on the Enigma Code.\n\nIn fact, when Desch took his wife, Dorothy, to Boston to meet the Navy\npersonnel at MIT, she was completely thrown when people at the welcoming\ncocktail party started greeting her husband as \"Dr. Desch.\"\n\n\"Dad said that people who mattered knew better, but that it was\nincomprehensible to the graduate students there that a man of his importance\nwouldn't be a Ph.D.,\" Debbie Anderson said.\n\nBorn in 1907, four years after the Wright brothers' first flight, to a German\nimmigrant mother and a long line of Dayton area wagonmakers, Desch capitalized\non his keen intelligence, and his fascination from an early age with the\nbudding technology of radio, to rise above his humble beginnings in Dayton\u2019s\nEdgemont neighborhood. He worked his way through the University of Dayton and\ngraduated with honors in electrical engineering.\n\nPrior to the war, Desch had built a national reputation for his work in\ndesigning miniature, fast-firing gas tubes \u2014 the \"microchips\" of the 1940s and\nthe basis for electronic calculators at the time. The Navy was betting that if\nanyone could build a new generation of super-fast deciphering machines, it was\nJoe Desch.\n\nThe Bombe project would not only prove to be the biggest technical challenge\nof Desch\u2019s career, but an overwhelming emotional drain. For the next two\nyears, it would mean working 14-hour days under mounting pressure from Navy\nofficials. It would mean severing relations with his German immigrant\nrelatives. It would mean being placed under 24-hour surveillance, with his\nsupervising officer quartered in his own home.\n\nFor the duration of the war, his life would be pinned under a microscope. And\nbefore it was over, he would suffer a nervous breakdown.\n\n\"They kept the pressure on, kept the pressure on and poor Joe took it very\nseriously,\" said Bob Mumma, the NCR business manager who reported directly to\nDesch and took over for him after his breakdown. \"It destroyed Joe's health.\"\n\nMumma, now 95 and a resident of the Otterbein Home in Lebanon, scoffed at the\nsuggestion that he and other involved in the Bombe project were heroes who\nshaved months from the conflict and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\n\"We were just trying to win the war,\" Mumma said.\n\nSPRING 1942\n\nFor weeks that spring, Desch pored over blueprints for what promised to be a\nremarkable new code-breaking machine developed by Navy theoreticians. Even\nthough he was overseeing 13 other military projects at NCR, this would be his\nultimate challenge \u2014 a totally electronic deciphering machine 100 times faster\nthan anything in use.\n\nThe Navy Bombe would rely on tens of thousands of the miniature, fast-pulsing\ntubes Desch himself had invented \u2014 pushed to the limit of their capabilities.\nAfter all, the foe they were attacking seemed almost invincible.\n\nWhen the German military purchased all rights to the Enigma Cipher Machine\nfirst conceived by Dutchman Hugo Koch in 1919, and added several of their own\ninnovations, they had every reason to think their coding system was\nimpenetrable \u2014 even if the machine were captured.\n\nIn essence, the Enigma was an electrical typewriter that scrambled each\nkeystroke through a series of alphabetized rotors, so that the text seemed\ngenerated at random. When a key was depressed, it tumbled the first rotor and,\nafter a complete revolution, a second and a third rotor \u2014 just like the\nodometer on a car. But on the Enigma, each rotor scrambled the alphabet in a\ndifferent way.\n\nThe operator could set each rotor at a different starting position as well,\nchanging the line-up of the rotors. A notched ring on one rotor controlled the\nrotational behavior of the rotor to its left. As an extra security measure,\nthe machine contained a plugboard that transposed individual letters (a for e,\nfor confuse anyone trying to crack the code.\n\nTo unscramble the text, the receiving Enigma operator would be sent the\noriginal rotor positions, in code, as part of the message. He would also have\na chart instructing him in that day's plugboard settings. Only an officer\ncould change the line-up of the rotors inside the machine, based on frequent\norders from command headquarters.\n\nWith all those variables in use, the possible number of Enigma encipherings\nfor each character was staggering \u2014 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 \u2014 or 10 to\nthe 23rd power. And when the Germans introduced a four-rotor machine in early\n1942, the possible combinations grew to 10 to the 26th power. (By comparison,\nthe number of all atoms in the observable universe is 3 to the 80th power.)\n\nIndeed, the Enigma might have been impregnable, except that even the Germans\ndid not always follow proper communications security. Lapses and laziness,\nsuch as not resetting the wheel positions between dispatches and using\npredictable greetings and sign-offs, would create \"cribs\" (strings of known or\nsuspected plain text) that would give Allied codebreakers the wedge they\nneeded to decipher intercepts.\n\nNor did the Germans know that the British had secretly captured Enigma code\ncharts and the machines themselves by raiding unwary German weather ships and\nboarding abandoned U-boats that couldn't be scuttled by their crews in time.\n\nThe NCR Bombe would basically work like an Enigma machine in reverse. By\nfeeding it a \"crib\" of known or suspected plain text from an intercepted\nmessage, the Bombe would crunch through all the billions upon billions of\npossible rotor combinations on the Enigma machine until it arrived at the\nrotor sequence that had enciphered the text. Once the positions of the four\nrotors were known for any part of the cipher, the remainder of the scrambled\ntext could be easily broken by running it in reverse through a captured Enigma\nmachine.\n\nBut the more Desch went over the Navy plans, the more his practical side\nbumped up against a major stumbling block \u2014 an all-electronic machine would\nrequire far too many gas tubes (70,000 in all) and generate too much heat to\noperate reliably.\n\nBut what would Desch tell the Navy intelligence officers who had put so much\nfaith in his engineering skills?\n\nMonday: A complex man with an impossible job.\n\nContact Jim DeBrosse at 225-2437 or by e-mail at jim_debrosse@coxohio.com\n\n[From the Dayton Daily News: 02.26.2001] PART TWO OF EIGHT\n\n## A complex man chosen for a complex and urgent mission, Joe Desch had to\nlook back to see ahead\n\nThe story so far: NCR engineer Joe Desch has been given the seemingly\nimpossible task of creating a high-speed machine that will quickly read the\nNazis' Enigma code. He has begun to see the problems ahead, as the war grinds\non. By By Jim DeBrosse Dayton Daily News\n\nWhile Joe Desch agonized over a practical machine that could break Enigma, the\nsecret Nazi submarine code, the German naval high command knew exactly what it\nhad to do to win the war: sever the lifeline between the industrial powerhouse\nof America and the plucky resistance of the British \u2014 the last hurdle in the\ntotal domination of Europe.\n\nThe German wolfpacks were wreaking havoc in the North Atlantic, the number of\nkills rising every month as British intelligence and U.S. Navy escorts\nfloundered without clues. A workable Bombe, as the codebreaking machine was\ncalled, was needed in a matter of months, not years.\n\n\"We were losing ships like mad. That's how this whole (project) got started,\"\nsaid Bob Mumma, an NCR manager who worked with Desch. \"Of course, Joe had been\nin ROTC and had been assigned to a unit. . . . He felt guilty, I think,\nbecause he wasn't active. That's what bothered him.\"\n\nPrior to heading the Bombe project, Desch had been commissioned as an officer\nin an Army ordnance unit. But when the Navy learned it might lose his\ntechnical expertise to the front, it pulled his orders, Anderson said. It was\na guilty favor he would remember for the rest of the war.\n\nLike the machine he was charged with building, Desch was a complex man: a\ndeeply religious Roman Catholic with a strong sense of ethics, and yet someone\nwho could unleash an inventive stream of curse words in the privacy of his\noffice. He smoked Chesterfields, two packs a day, and when the work day was\nover, he liked his Scotch and water neat.\n\nHe had a surprisingly sentimental side, too. Letters to his wife, Dorothy,\nwere always addressed to \"Sweetie-pie\" and ended with strings of X's for\nkisses and the signature \"Icky Boo.\" On a business trip to New York in 1938,\nthree years after their marriage, he sent her two letters on the same day, one\nwondering if she had seen the moon as he had seen it when his train had pulled\nout of the station early that morning.\n\nThose who worked closest with Desch describe him as a technical genius who\nalso was blessed with management skills. He was self-possessed and self-\nconfident, without being cocky. \"We were a good team. I took care of the\ndetails, he took care of the front office. He knew how to talk to those\npeople,\" Mumma recalled. \"And we both knew a hell of a lot about electronics.\"\n\nDesch loved to garden, loved to dance, especially waltzes. He was an excellent\nballroom dancer, Kettering's Debbie Anderson said of her father. \"Mom said\nmore than once they cleared the floor\" at the Biltmore Hotel, a popular Dayton\nnightspot at the time.\n\nDesch's background was a far cry from the Ivy League types at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology who had come to trust in his industrial\nknow-how. He had lived the idyllic childhood of an early 20th century Huck\nFinn, canoeing and camping along the banks of the Great Miami River, shooting\ncraps in the back alleys of Edgemont, hawking newspapers in the morning and\nushering at nights at the Victory Theatre for his spending money. He was an\naltar boy and straight-A student at Emmanuel Elementary School, but enough of\na troublemaker to have punched one of his Marianist instructors, and knocked\nhim down, in a dispute over a math solution.\n\n\"He was a bit irreverent when he had to be,\" his daughter said. \"But he got a\nscholarship to (the University of Dayton) prep school, so I guess the\nMarianists weren't too mad at him.\"\n\nUnlike many of his young friends, Desch took no interest in hunting. He\ncouldn't bring himself to kill, not even the rabbits his father had asked him\nto raise, Anderson said. \"He loved taking care of the rabbits and building the\nhutch and all, but then when it came time to do what he had to do with them,\nhe couldn't do it,\" she said. \"I don't know if he sold them or not, but he\ngave them to a friend instead.\"\n\nMuch of Desch's technical knowledge was hands-on and self-taught, beginning in\nchildhood. His father, grandfather and uncles were all master wagon-makers who\nknew how to work both with wood and metal and could fashion just about any\ntool for themselves.\n\n\"Dad learned how to tinker at a very early age,\" Anderson said. \"He saw his\nfirst operating radio downtown when he was 11, and he was fascinated with it.\nHe couldn't afford a new one, so he built his own. That's what determined the\nrest of his working life.\"\n\nAs a teen-ager, he started making his own vacuum tubes in the basement of his\nparent's house on Kirkham Street \u2014 launching his lifelong devotion to the\nfield.\n\nAfter graduating with honors from UD in 1929, he went straight to GM's radio\ndivision, where he supervised the testing of radios. Nine years later, he was\nhand-picked to run NCR's new electronic research department. His assignment:\ndesign the first electronic adding machine.\n\nDesch's focus was designing smaller, faster and more reliable gas tubes for\ncomputation. As America's entry into the war neared, his successes would lead\nto military contracts for a variety of useful weapons. By the time the Navy\napproached Desch with its Bombe plans in the spring of 1942, the Army already\nhad entrusted him with a project to design a \"proximity fuse\" \u2014 a radar-\ncontrolled shell that would automatically explode as it neared airborne\ntargets. And as part of the Manhattan Project, he was designing a high-speed\nelectronic counter needed for developing the atom bomb.\n\nBut all that work would be swept aside for the Navy's highest priority \u2014\nbreaking the Enigma Code.\n\nIn a tersely stated letter to the National Defense Research Committee on Aug.\n17, 1942, Desch wrote: \"We have other work of higher priority rating on which\nwe can usefully place our engineers, but once they are started on such other\nwork, they cannot be withdrawn . . . for some time to come.\"\n\nBy mid-summer, two of the Navy's bright young theoreticians were in England\nlearning all about the British bombe and sending reports back to the States.\nDesch received at least some of that information, enough to persuade him that\nhe needed to take a direction different from both the British and the U.S.\nNavy if he were to turn out a machine in time.\n\nAfter weeks of agonizing, Desch decided on a major technological leap \u2014\nbackwards. He proposed an electromechanical device that wouldn't be pretty,\nwouldn't be elegant, but would accomplish the job through sheer brute force.\n\n\"We never had any doubt about it. We knew what (the machine) had to do,\" Mumma\nsaid. \"It was just a matter of time, but time was of the essence.\"\n\nTuesday: Surrendering his privacy for the war.\n\nContact Jim DeBrosse at 225-2437 or by e-mail at jim_debrosse@coxohio.com\n\n[From the Dayton Daily News: 02.28.2001]\n\nPART THREE OF EIGHT\n\n## Enigma, Intense scrutiny, feelings of guilt were heavy burdens for Desch\n\nThe story so far: As World War II grinds on, the Allies are trying to break\nthe Nazi's famously difficult Enigma code, which uses a special rotor-driven\nmachine to create billions of possible letter combinations. The British\ncapture a machine and crack the code, but the Germans modify it and regain the\nupper hand. In 1942, the U.S. Navy turns to Dayton's National Cash Register\nCo. to create an electronic machine that can quickly read Enigma. While Allied\nshipping is being sunk by U-boats and lives are being lost, the effort to make\na \"Bombe,\" as the code-reading machine was called, fall on the shoulders of a\nsingle Dayton engineer at NCR: Joe Desch, whose efforts have remained so\nsecret since then that even his daughter, Debbie Anderson of Kettering, only\nlearned a few years ago how her father helped win the war. But the effort was\nlong and hard, and took a terrible personal toll on Desch, a sensitive, self-\ntaught man.\n\nBy Jim DeBrosse Dayton Daily News\n\nSEPTEMBER-DECEMBER,1942\n\nIn mid-September, Joe Desch went back to the Navy brass with a revised plan\nfor a decoding machine that could approach the performance, if not the\nelegance, of the Navy'sall-electronic design. Desch's Bombe \u2014 part electronic\nbut mostly mechanical \u2014 would crack the German Enigma code through sheer size\nand speed. And more importantly, as the war raged on, his Bombe could be\nproduced in a matter of months rather than years.\n\nTrusting in Desch and the solid reputation of NCR, the Navy promised\neverything and anything he needed to get the job done as quickly as possible \u2014\nmillions of dollars in funding, hundreds of trained personnel and a top-secret\npriority second only to the Manhattan Project and the development of the\nA-Bomb.\n\n\"It was so important that requests to the White House were processed within a\nday and cost overruns of incredible size were accepted without question,\"\nhistorian Colin Burke wrote in Information and Secrecy. \"The jump from an\nestimate of $2 million to one of $4 million in a few months did not threaten\nthe program.\"\n\nBut part of the bargain was that Desch's own life would come under intense\nscrutiny. He spent three days in Washington, D.C., under relentless\ninterrogation before getting his security clearance. His inquisitors hurled\ninsults and accusations, trying to break him down. It became so abusive that\nDesch told the Navy he didn't want the job \u2014 at which point they told him he\nwas cleared and should return to Dayton to begin his assignment.\n\n\"He told me once he had had it up to here with their bull,\" said Debbie\nAnderson, his daughter, who lives in Kettering today. \"But he must have calmed\ndown, because he got the job.\"\n\nThe Navy was particularly concerned about Desch's German relatives. His\nmother, Augusta Stoermer, had emigrated from Germany at age 13. She had worked\nher way from Liverpool, England, to an uncle's home in Pittsburgh, where she\nmade cigars, and finally to Dayton, where she met Edward Frank Desch and\nmarried him in 1906. The elder Desch died in 1937.\n\nHomesick even in her later years, Desch's mother had kept in touch with\nrelatives in Europe and had even gone back twice to Germany before the war.\nBut even worse, Desch's half-cousin, Augusta \"Gusty\" Zimmerman, had a father\nstill in Germany who was active in the Nazi Party, and a husband in Dayton who\nhad tuned into Hitler's broadcasts before the war.\n\nDesch was allowed limited visits with his mother and two younger sisters, but\nonly if the family avoided all contact with Gusty and her husband. \"There was\na lot of bitterness with (Gusty),\" who didn't unders around.\"\n\nDesch was never out of sight of his Navy \"shadows\" \u2014 plainclothes guards who\nsat in parked cars outside his home and office, waiting to tail him around\ntown. Years later, Desch would gleefully tell his daughter what fun it had\nbeen in the beginning to take the guards on wild goose chases. One evening he\ndrove miles out of his way into the country to the old Belmont Dairy, only to\nreturn to his driveway. The guards ignored his greetings when he stepped out\nof his car.\n\nHardest for Desch to swallow, the Navy commander in charge of the project, Lt.\nCmdr. Ralph Meader, was quartered in Desch's Oakwood home to keep an eye on\nhim. The arrangement in the two-bedroom Tudor cottage at 413 Greenmount Blvd.,\nwhich Desch had built just two years earlier for himself and his young bride\nDorothy, was often tense.\n\n\"This Captain Meader . . . practically slept in his bed,\" said Bob Mumma, an\nNCR manager who worked with Desch. \"I'll tell you, day and night, he couldn't\nget rid of him. Joe just about lost his mind.\"\n\nSecurity at NCR was super-tight. Building 26, formerly NCR's night school at\nStewart Street and Patterson Boulevard, was converted into a top-secret\nassembly plant, with machine gun-toting Marines watching from the roof. The\nguards were wounded veterans who had seen action early in the war, and they\ncould be skittish, as Lou Sandor, one of the chief engineers on the Bombe\nproject, discovered. Sandor, now 86, lives in Columbia, S.C.\n\n\"I had a habit of slamming the door to the restroom whenever I went in,\"\nSandor recalled. One day he startled a Marine who was shaving in a restroom\nsink. \"All of a sudden, I was staring into the barrel of a .45. I don't know\nwho was scared more \u2014 me or the Marine who almost shot me.\"\n\nPractically overnight, Desch's research department at NCR grew from a staff of\n20 to more than 1,000. The Navy would give him just about anything he asked\nfor, but Desch said later he got little direct help from the British.\n\n\"It was a one-way street,\" Desch told a Smithsonian historian in 1973. \"The\nBritish came over and visited me and looked at everything I was doing, but I\ncould never see anything they were doing.\"\n\nBurke said better sharing of information about the Enigma between the two\nAllies \"would have saved (NCR) at least three to six months\" of crucial\ndevelopment time. But he said the British weren't entirely to blame. A U.S.\nNaval delegation was invited to tour Bletchley Park, the British Ultra\ncodebreaking operation located outside of London, in 1941. \"But when they came\nback (to the States), the information didn't get to the right people\" \u2014\nincluding Desch.\n\nIn December 1942, Alan Turing, the genius behind Ultra, visited NCR to offer\ndvice, but ended up zinging much of what he saw in a cathing memo. Turing\nfound fault with everything from the machine's gearing to its wheel sizes, but\nwas especially snippy about an automatic feature that Desch and the other NCR\nengineers were proud of \u2014 the machine's ability to brake at high speeds and\nreverse itself to the exact sequence of rotor positions that had broken the\ncode.\n\n\"They say the whole machine is being built sufficiently strong to withstand\nsuch strain,\" Turing wrote. \"Possibly the real objection to this method is\nthat the time taken over each stop is fairly considerable . . . 15 seconds,\nand of course it seems a pity for them to go out of their way to build the\nmachine to do all this stopping if it is not necessary.\"\n\nThe Navy brass decided not to pass the memo on to Desch, for fear it would\ndestroy his morale. Even so, Desch would pay a heavy emotional price in the\nmonths that followed. Developing a workable, reliable Bombe would take months\nlonger than anyone had suspected. Through it all, Meader kept the pressure on.\n\nEven the usually even-tempered Desch began showing signs of the strain. After\none especially tense meeting with Meader and top-ranking Navy officials, \"Dad\ncame out and got up on a table and started shouting that everybody had to\nstart working harder and working faster and get this machine out,\" Anderson\nsaid.\n\nMeader had found an effective, and ultimately devastating, tool for motivating\nDesch \u2014 his guilt.\n\n\"Joe told me privately after the war that Meader said he or the deaths of a\nlot of American boys if he didn't get the job done \u2014 that was a tremendous\namount of pressure for anyone, but especially for Joe,\" said Carl Rench, 79, a\nformer NCR engineer and vice president who became Desch's closest friend soon\nafter joining the company in 1946. \"Let me put it this way, he was a very\nreligious man.\"\n\nAnderson said her father told her long after the war that he had felt so much\nanguish over the sailors who were drowning in the Atlantic that he believed\nhis ery soul was in jeopardy. \"This was the Catholic in him \u2014 he felt like he\nwas in a constant state of mortal sin, so he stopped going to church.\"\n\nThe race to perfect the NCR Bombe, in many ways, was a race against Desch's\nown mounting burden of guilt.\n\nWednesday: A modern-day search for the truth.\n\nContact Jim DeBrosse at225-2437 or by e-mail atjim_debrosse@coxohio.com\n\n[From the Dayton Daily News: 02.28.2001]\n\nPART FOUR OF EIGHT\n\n## Daughter's quest raises more questions\n\nBy Jim DeBrosse Dayton Daily News\n\nMAY 10, 1990\n\nDebbie Anderson was having a late breakfast with her husband Darrell, chairman\nof the theater department at the University of Dayton, when a story in the\nLifestyle section of the Dayton Daily News caught her eye.\n\nIt was about a special exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution on the\ndevelopment of the modern computer, called \"The Age of Information.\"\n\nPart of the exhibit was a decrypting machine built by Dayton's National Cash\nRegister Co. during the war. Bill West, then the archivist at NCR, credited\nAnderson's father, Joe Desch, and his assistant, Bob Mumma, with building the\nmachine.\n\nIt was the first time Anderson had ever seen anyone publicly give credit to\nher father for the NCR Bombe.\n\n\"I had a migraine that morning . . . so I didn't trust what I saw. I reread it\nseveral times,\" she said. \"And then I was kind of miffed. Here this machine\ngoes to the Smithsonian and it was built by my dad, and nobody even bothered\nto call me.\" Anderson decided to travel to Washington, D.C., with her family.\n\"I told my husband, 'Darn it, we should go down there and see this machine.\nThe kids should see it.' \"\n\nHer next move was to contact the Smithsonian curator quoted in the story to\nsee if she could find out more. The curator, in turn, referred her to a\nhistorian at the National Security Agency.\n\n\"I think he (the NSA historian) was stunned when I called,\" Anderson said. \"I\ndon't think anyone was supposed to give out their names and phone numbers\nthere.\"\n\nThe historian agreed to meet with her, suggesting they do so informally at a\ncoffee shop. But when Anderson said that she possessed documents, possibly\nclassified ones, that she hoped to have explained, \"there was a pause and he\nsaid, 'Oh, you'd better come directly to us.' \"\n\nJUNE 23, 1990\n\nThe Anderson's Astro Van was routed to the rear of the bunker-like NSA\nheadquarters \u2014 a massive concrete structure at Ft. Meade, Md. \u2014 where they\nwere greeted by armed guards and told to remain in their vehicle.\n\nMoments later, when the historian who had arranged to meet Anderson arrived at\nthe guard shack, she emerged with her Lazarus bag filled with documents. But\nwhen her two boys, ages 14 and 11, also started to exit the van, hoping to\nstretch their legs after the drive from their motel, they were told to stay\ninside.\n\nIt was just Anderson the historian wanted to see.\n\n\"So Darrell (her husband) drives off and here I am surrounded by all these\nmen,\" she said. \"I thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, what have I gotten myself into?\u2019 \"\n\nThe contents of her bag were emptied and inspected, and Anderson was put\nthrough a metal detector before she was permitted to enter the building.\n\nAnderson spent the next six hours inside the NSA headquarters, where she did\nnearly all the talking.\n\n\"The day was spent looking through the stuff I brought,\" she said. \"People\nwould come and go, and not one time in six hours did they make a comment.\nThey'regood at that.\"\n\nThere was one reaction, however. \"A younger guy came in, close to my age, and\nI don't remember what he was looking at, but all he said was, 'Wow. Can you\nwait a minute while I show this to somebody?' He went away and came back, but\nhe never said a word about why he was so excited.\"\n\nWhen it was time to leave and Anderson started gathering up her father's\nthings, the historian said to her, \" 'You realize, of course, I can't let you\ntake these out of the building,' \" she recalled.\n\nHe said the documents had to be closely examined, to make sure all the\nmaterial had been declassified. If so, her things would be returned to her by\nmail.\n\nAnderson protested, but had no choice. She did, however, insist on an\nitemized, signed receipt. The material she left behind was returned, by third-\nclass mail, three months later.\n\nAnderson left that day disappointed. She had come to the NSA hoping to get\nsome answers about her father's secret. Instead, she had only fed the secret\nwith the little bit that she knew.\n\nParts of the NCR machine may still be secret, and although NSA officials won't\nsay why, some experts believe it's because some of the same technology was\nused against the Soviets during the Cold War, and may still be in use today.\n\nNCR \"continued to be a major contractor for the government (after the war),\nand Joe (Desch) continued to sit on the advisory board\" to the National\nSecurity Agency, said historian Colin Burke, author of Information and\nSecrecy, the first book to detail the development of the NCR Bombe. \"But the\ndocuments aren't out there\" to confirm NCR's Cold War involvement.\n\nPatrick Weadon, an NSA public affairs officer, said, \"We can't comment. The\ncloser you get to present day, the less we can discuss.\"\n\nJUNE 24, 1990\n\nAfter years of trying to imagine what had consumed her father during the war,\nDebbie Anderson's first look at the NCR Bombe surprised her. \"I was amazed at\nhow huge it was,\" she said. \"It was much bigger, much more imposing than what\nI had expected.\"\n\nHer next reaction was frustration. The 7-foot-tall, 11-foot-long, 5,000-pound\nelectromechanical decoder sat behind a waist-high partition at the\nSmithsonian, with no mention of her father's name in any of the plaques or\nbrochures.\n\n\"Here I was at the end of a pilgrimage. I felt a connection to this thing and\nI wanted to go up and touch it, but I couldn't,\" she said. \"There was a stream\nof people waiting and we just had to keep moving on.\"\n\nThe label describing the machine \"said it was manufactured at NCR, not\ndesigned there,\" Anderson said. \"I really wanted to smart off about it to\nsomebody, but I didn't.\" It was what Anderson had come to dub \"the standard\none-line reference\" to NCR's role in breaking the German Enigma code. The\nhistory books she had read and the few documents that she had thus far been\nable to obtain from the National Archive gave NCR credit for building the 120\nBombes and nothing more \u2014 as if the enormously complex machines had been\nstamped off an assembly line like so many widgets.\n\n\"It was so frustrating,\" Anderson said. \"I knew there had to be more to the\nstory, but no one would talk.\"\n\nThe lone remaining NCR Bombe would later be transferred from the Smithsonian\nto the NSA's National Cryptologic Museum at Ft. Meade, Md., where it is now on\npermanent display under the watchful eyes of NSA officials.\n\nOn their way back to Ohio that summer, Anderson and her family stopped at the\nPennsylvania home of Esther Hottenstein, a Navy staff person who had operated\nNCR's secure telephone and telegraph lines to Washington, D.C. during the war.\n\nHottenstein had worked closely with Desch during her years in Dayton \"and was\nvery, very fond of Dad,\" Anderson said. Although she had been a schoolteacher\nprior to the war, Hottenstein had really wanted to be a physician, just as her\nbrothers were, even though few women were encouraged to do so at that time.\n\nAt the close of the war, Desch advised her to \"follow her instincts,\" Anderson\nsaid. \"She went on to medical school and became a family doctor,, and she was\nalways thankful to Dad for that.\"\n\nFor many years after the war, she kept in touch with Desch by mail and, after\nhis death in 1987, with Anderson.\n\nAnderson was looking forward to at last meeting Hottenstein in person, and\nalthough her visit sealed their friendship, it proved useless in her quest to\nlearn more about her father's work.\n\nAll her questions were answered with the same polite reticence she had\nreceived at the NSA, Anderson said. \"It was always, 'Well, gee, I can't\ntellyou about that.' \"\n\nContact Jim DeBrosse at 225-2437 or by e-mail at jim_debrosse@coxohio.com\n\n[From the Dayton Daily News: 03.01.2001] PART FIVE OF EIGHT\n\n## The enemy codes crack, but not Joe Desch\u2019s folks\n\nBy Jim DeBrosse Dayton Daily News\n\nMARCH 19, 1943\n\nAs one of the first technicians assigned to the top-secret NCR Bombe project,\nPhil Bochicchio, a Navy engineer from New Jersey, arrived in Dayton with\norders to report to the U.S. Naval Computing Machine Laboratory, no street\naddress given.\n\nBut when Bochicchio alighted at Union Station, he couldn't find a listing for\nthe laboratory in the phone book or even anyone who had heard of the place. He\nwalked around downtown, to the police and fire stations and then the Navy\nrecruiting office. None of them had heard of the lab, either.\n\nFinally, at the Dayton Municipal Building, a man at the Chamber of Commerce\noffered to drive Bochicchio out to NCR, where the Navy had several other\nprojects in progress. But at NCR, the Navy liaison officer seemed clueless as\nwell, Bochicchio recalled.\n\n\"He looked at my orders and said, 'I don't know what to do with you.' I said,\n'Well, great. Just give me something to do.' \"\n\nBochicchio did building maintenance at NCR for two weeks before he learned\nanything of the project that had summoned him to Dayton \u2014 and only after he\nhad undergone a thorough background check.\n\n\"I got a letter from my Dad saying call home as soon as I can. When I called,\nmy dad said, 'What kind of trouble are you in, boy? The FBI has been here,\nNaval intelligence has been here. All the neighbors are wondering.' \"\n\nBochicchio wasn't in trouble, but he was in for a lot of hard work. As floor\nmanager of the Bombe project in NCR's Building 26, he was in charge of setting\nup and debugging the mammoth decrypting machines. The Desch Bombe was a marvel\nof engineering \u2014 but, like all complex, unproven machines, prone to glitches.\n\nBochicchio said a big part of Desch's headache was trying to please both the\nNavy theoreticians, who designed the logic of the machine and insisted on\nspeed, and the Navy cryptologists, who wanted something reliable and easy to\nmaintain.\n\n\"The mathematician thinks one way, the cryptologist thinks another. And you're\nsitting in the middle and you have to try to figure out how in the hell to\ngive them both what they needed from the machine,\" Bochicchio said.\n\nThe original NCR Bombe housed 16 four-wheel sets of Enigma analogs, or\ncommutators, linked by miles of wiring. (Each machine was the equivalent of 16\nEnigma machines, working in reverse.) To test the hundreds of thousands of\npossible combinations of Enigma rotor positions, each wheel contained 104\nelectrical contact points and had to be perfectly aligned when they touched\nthe copper-and-silver sensing brushes.\n\nThat was a big order, especially when the first wheel of the machine spun at\nclose to 2,000 rpms. At such speeds, keeping the wheels in balance and in\ntheir original shape was a daunting task.\n\nTo solve the problems of heat and distortion, Desch had wanted to use two\nsmaller wheels, instead of one large one, as the first and fastest of the\ncommutators. The Navy nixed that idea. Two wheels would add too much time and\ntoo many parts to codebreaking operations, since the wheels would have to be\nreplaced before each run.\n\nThe machine also was prone to sparks and short circuits that ruined decoding\nruns, and oil leaks that created maintenance nightmares. Sensing brushes had\nto be kept oil-free. Power had to be evenly delivered through a complex of\nmotors, shafts and clutches.\n\nIn short, the NCR Bombe was like a high-performance race car engine being\npushed to its limits \u2014 before anyone even knew for certain it would work.\n\nThe original contract calling for the first Bombes to be delivered to the Navy\nin February 1943 was totally unrealistic, and Desch probably knew it from the\nstart, intelligence historian Colin Burke said.Desch still hadn't produced a\nworkable machine by March, when the German U-Boats were expected to strike\nAllied shipping in an all-out effort to turn the war.\n\nAfter six months of intensive development, all Desch had fashioned were two\ntemperamental prototypes, dubbed Adam and Eve, that leaked oil and broke down\nafter two hours of operating at the speeds demanded by the Navy. The intense\nheat and centrifugal force warped and chipped the machine's fast-spinning\nwheels, made from a heat-resistant plastic called Bakelite.\n\nIn the meantime, Lt. Cmdr. Ralph Meader, the Navy commander in charge of the\nproject, was constantly on Desch's back, reminding him of the American sailors\nwho would die if the new machines didn't come on line.\n\n\"We were not actually aware of that,\" said Lou Sandor, part of the engineering\nteam working for Desch. \"We knew that (the machine) was for a decoding\nactivity, but we just didn't know the details of it. . . . But I'm sure Joe\nwas aware.\"\n\nDebbie Anderson of Kettering, Desch's only child, believes Meader never\nsuspected the full impact of his guilt-lashings. \"Now I understand why Dad was\nreally conflicted and angry most of his life,\" she said. \"The Joe Desch I know\ncarried a lot of anger around. I know it wasn't about me and Mom. And I wasn't\nsure it was about NCR, either.\"\n\nStill, Desch didn't often lose his cool, at least not with his employees. \"He\nwas an amazing person to work for, very even-tempered,\" Sandor said. \"Almost\neveryone I knew got mad (during the project). But I never saw Joe get mad and\nhe had an awful lot of reasons to.\"\n\nInstead, he internalized the pressure and guilt, took it home, let it fester\nthrough the long hours of the night. When he could get away for an hour or\ntwo, Desch liked to retreat to his garden plot off Wilmington Avenue, where he\ngrew everything from corn to kohlrabi. And he loved to whistle, Anderson said,\nmostly Sousa marches and snatches of classical music and old romantic movie\nscores, perhaps to keep the demons in his life at bay.\n\nAs Dayton's steamy summer days approached and tempers began to flare, Desch\nand his engineers relied on old-fashioned tinkering. They found better ways of\nprotecting the Bakelite wheels against the heat. Bochicchio served up a few\ntricks of his own, including soaking the machine's leather seals in oil before\ninstallation, to prevent leakage, and installing a circuit tester that checked\nfor opens and shorts prior to running the machine. He also helped refine a\ncircuit to filter out the \"electronic noise\" from the machine's wire sensing\nbrushes as they bounced along the spinning surfaces of the rotors, thus\nreducing the number of false \"hits.\"\n\nThe frustration at NCR was always with design, never with production. The\nengineers and technicians were amazed at how quickly they could get anything\nthey needed from subcontractors. \"From an engineering standpoint, it was\nwonderful,\" Sandor recalled. \"Instead of waiting weeks and months, we had what\nwe wanted in a few days. It was an absolute priority.\"\n\nIn the end, the NCR Bombe was too late to be the only decisive factor in the\nBattle of the Atlantic. Small escort carriers, converted from old freighters,\nwere already doing that by providing air coverage for convoys.\n\nEven so, the NCR Bombes \u2014 along with new radar that enabled pilots to hone in\non U-boats \u2014 enabled the Allies to become the hunters, rather than the hunted,\nin the North Atlantic, said Bob Cressman, a historian at the Naval Historical\nCenter in Washington, D.C. \"Initially, we would send our convoys around where\nwe thought the submarines would be,\" he said. \"But later on we had enough\nknowledge from the (deciphered) German codes that we could pinpoint where the\nsubmarines were going . . . and we started going after these guys.\"\n\nUsing U-boat transmissions cracked by an NCR Bombe prototype, pilots from the\nescort carrier USS Bogue located and sank the first German submarine in a\npurely offensive attack on June 5, 1943.\n\nCertainly, it wasn't too late for the NCR Bombe to help pave the way for the\nD-Day invasion and shorten what promised to be a long, brutal war \u2014 if it\ncould be made reliable and produced in great enough numbers in time.\n\n\"The alternative methods that the British were using had failed\" against the\nGerman's four-rotor Enigma, Burke said. And even though the Brits later\nproduced a four-wheel bombe in the summer of 1943, it was never as reliable as\nthe American machines. \"The only thing that could keep things moving as far as\n(Enigma) intelligence was the NCR Bombe.\"\n\nBy late May 1943, enough of the bugs had been worked out of the NCR machines\nthat the Navy decided to push ahead with full-scale production. That called\nfor a massive infusion of skilled manpower \u2014 or in this case, womanpower \u2014 to\nget the job done.\n\nContact Jim DeBrosse at 225-2437 or by e-mail at jim_debrosse@coxohio.com.\n\n[From the Dayton Daily News: 03.02.2001] PART SIX OF EIGHT\n\n## WAVES roll in to work on top-secret project\n\nBy Jim DeBrosse Dayton Daily News\n\nMAY, 1943\n\nAfter boot camp in the Bronx and two weeks of training and background checks\nin Washington, D.C., the WAVES were told only that they were being shipped\nwest to work on a top-secret project \u2014 and to keep their mouths shut. As newly\nenlisted members of the U.S. Navy women's auxiliary, they would be joining\nanother 400 or so civilian employees at NCR.\n\nTheir commanding officers in Washington \"specifically told us they would shoot\nus at sunrise if we talked about what we were doing,\" said Evelyn Hodges\nVogel, now 75 and a resident of Tucson, Ariz. The plucky Missouri native had\nlied about her age to enlist in the Women Appointed for Voluntary Emergency\nService at age 18. Recruits were supposed to be at least 21, but Vogel's\nfather, a Navy man himself, had signed the papers against her mother's wishes.\n\n\"And we did keep our mouths shut,\" Vogel said. \"Men always think women have\nbig mouths, but we didn't. We were so proud to be serving in the armed forces\nand doing something that women had never done before.\"\n\nIn all, 600 WAVES would pass through Dayton to assemble Bombes at the U.S.\nNaval Machine Computing Laboratory at NCR, where their skills were desperately\nneeded to offset the wartime shortage of men. Few had an inkling of the\nsignificance of their work until nearly a half century later, during a reunion\nhere in 1995.\n\n\"I never even told anyone I was in the service until the last few years,\" said\nEvelyn Urich Einfeldt, now a 78-year-old resident of Oklahoma City.\n\nThe WAVES were quartered at Sugar Camp off Schantz Avenue, once a training\ncenter for the NCR sales force. They bunked eight to a cabin. Sixty of the\nAdirondack-style structures sat on a wooded hilltop overlooking Carillon Park.\n\nDuring peak production, the bunks never grew cold: one shift of women worked\nwhile another slept. Shifts ran eight to 12 hours long, 24 hours a day, and\nwere rotated weekly.\n\nTo maintain discipline and esprit de corps, the WAVES marched \u2014 to meals, to\nclasses, to work. \"We were marched all the time, no matter what the weather,\"\nsaid Catherine Convery Racz, 79, a Boston native who married a sailor from\nDayton. She still lives here.\n\nEach morning, 200 WAVES marched in full uniform from Sugar Camp \u2014 north on\nMain Street and west on Stewart to Patterson Boulevard \u2014 to NCR's Building 26,\nwhich overlooked the Great Miami River.\n\nThere they wired, soldered and assembled different parts of the massive Bombes\n\u2014 in separate rooms, so no one could identify a whole machine. To further keep\nsecrecy, one WAVE was given the wiring diagram for one side of a commutator\nwheel, while a second WAVE soldered the other side of the same wheel. \"I\nalways said I was the best solderer on this side of the room,\" Racz quipped.\n\"We got to be perfect.\"\n\nThe work could be tedious and exacting. WAVES who were less adept at soldering\nmade wire harnesses, said Phil Bochicchio, who was floor manager of the NCR\nproject. The 78-year-old retired engineer now lives in Ellicott City, Md. \"We\nlaid out plywood boards with nails, and each wire had a color code that went\nto a particular nail. Then they had to lace all those wires together with wax\nstring. Finally, the girls that were adept at soldering nested those lacings\ninto place.\"\n\n\"There was no room for mistakes. Now I understand why,\" former WAVE Jimmie Lee\nLong of Texas said in a letter to Debbie Anderson, daughter of the project's\nchief engineer, Joe Desch. Anderson helped organize the WAVE reunion here in\n1995.\n\nIntelligence historian Colin Burke said it was a testament to the WAVES'\nskills that the machines eventually proved so reliable: sloppy soldering was a\nmajor problem for other early computer prototypes, but not the NCR Bombes.\n\nOnce their shifts ended, the WAVES were free to enjoy themselves. Sugar Camp\nhad a swimming pool, baseball diamond and recreation hall. Movies and skits\nwere regularly shown in the auditorium, and the camp's cafeteria was renowned.\n\"The food was excellent,\" Racz recalled. \"I know we had a lot of good beef \u2014\nthings people on the outside didn't have during the war.\"\n\nDorothy Firor remembers the special advantages of living close to the Sugar\nCamp pool. \"We went skinny-dipping in between the times the night watchman\nmade his rounds.\"\n\nFor those WAVES who craved more excitement, downtown was jumping with after-\nhour spots \u2014 including restaurants and ballrooms at the Biltmore, Van Cleve\nand Miami hotels, as well as Lance's Merry-Go-Round, with its famous revolving\ndance-floor chandelier \u2014 where they could spend some of their $21-a-month\nstipend from the Navy. The women had an easy time getting around Dayton, even\nthough the camp's transport \u2014 an old Woody station wagon \u2014 often broke down\nand had to be pushed.\n\n\"Wherever we were going, people would stop and ask us if we would like a\nride,\" Vogel said. \"Of course, in those days, nobody ever harmed us. The Age\nof Innocence was still intact.\"\n\nVogel, a small-town Missouri native, found plenty to do downtown back then.\n\"It was a lot like Kansas City, which was the nearest big city where I was\nbrought up,\" she said. \"It turned out to be a wonderful duty station.\"\n\nIn the midst of the fun, the WAVES never forget their duty. If anyone asked\nabout their work at NCR, they were instructed to say they were training on\nadding machines. \"People must have thought we were pretty stupid to be there\nall that time learning how to run adding machines,\" Einfeldt said.\n\nSeveral WAVES recalled how Joe and Dorothy Desch, older and more\nsophisticated, had floated in and out of their lives at Sugar Camp for Sunday\ndinners and other festivities \u2014 and always in the company of the couple's\nwatchdog and unwanted house guest, Lt. Cmdr. Ralph Meader.\n\n\"We were all in awe of Joe and Dorothy, because they were beautiful people in\nappearance \u2014 like movie stars. And always dressed so fashionably,\" Vogel said.\n\"Dorothy was more accessible. I don't mean that Joe was unfriendly, just kind\nof aloof.\"\n\nVogel said she realizes now that Desch must have been preoccupied with the\nproject. \"I know darn well he was,\" she said. \"I found out later that it quite\nupset him to have Commander Meader in their home. I know it would have upset\nme.\"\n\nThe WAVES viewed Meader as a \"fatherly type,\" Vogel said. \"He was easy to talk\nto. He always called us 'his girls.' We weren't in awe of him as we were of\nJoe.\"\n\nFor many of the WAVES, the months at NCR passed almost like a dream. In fact,\nuntil top-secret documents were declassified in the early 1990s, it was as if\nthe WAVES hadn't been here at all.\n\n\"There was no record I was ever in Dayton,\" Racz said. \"For years, I couldn't\nunderstand why. All the important people who were there, and we still didn't\nknow what was going on.\"\n\nThe notable visitors to NCR included Cmdr. Edward Travis, head of the British\nUltra operation at Bletchley Park; Capt. Joseph R.

Armed security guards were parked in\ncars outside the home throughout the night.\n\n\"High-level people (from England) came over quite frequently,\" Desch recalled\nin a 1973 interview with a Smithsonian historian. \"Admirals and even members\nof Parliament and Lords of the Admiralty and, Lord, I always ended up with\nthem in my house.\"\n\nAnderson said her father told her \"these guys would literally sleep on the\nliving room floor. . . .

At first,\nhe thought it was just one more electrical short in the temperamental device.\n\nBut then, as it was designed to do, the Bombe came back to life and began\nslowly to rewind. That could mean only one thing: it had scored a \"hit\" on\npart of an Enigma message fed into the machine.\n\nWhen a hit occurred, a complete circuit surged through all 64 of the Bombe's\nfast-spinning \"commutator\" wheels \u2014 possible only if it had arrived at the\npositions of all four rotors on the Enigma machine that may have created the\nmessage. The surge set off a braking mechanism that stopped the Bombe's wheels\nwithin four to five revolutions, then rewound them back to their hit positions\nand printed out the rotor sequence.\n\nThat's exactly what happened, but Bochicchio, the floor manager on the\nproject, still was skeptical. He had a fellow engineer run the same encrypted\nmessage through \"Eve,\" the other prototype. It shut off in precisely the same\nrotor positions.\n\nBochicchio gave the print-out to Lt. Cmdr. Ralph Meader, the Navy official in\ncharge of NCR's massive Nazi-codebreaking effort. Meader wired the results to\nNaval intelligence in Washington, D.C. Codebreakers there could hardly believe\ntheir good fortune. The rotor positions enabled them to unscramble a series of\nintercepted German radio messages over the next two weeks, revealing that the\nGermans were moving 17 submarines to attack westbound Allied Convoy GUS-7A.\nThe convoy's escort carrier, the USS Bogue, sent its pilots to hunt down and\nscatter the wolfpack \u2014 sinking one sub and damaging three others.\n\nBochicchio wouldn't learn until June 5 how important that inaugural hit was,\nwhen Howard Engstrom, head of the Navy's machine decoding section, sent an\nencrypted teletype message to NCR informing the engineers that the May 24 hit\nalone \"had paid for the entire cost of the NCR project.\"\n\nBut there was no time to celebrate. Even at this late stage of development,\nthe NCR engineers were struggling with the machine's most basic part. \"Those\nlarge rotors seemed destined to overheat, lose their shape and create faulty\nelectrical signals,\" historian Colin Burke wrote in Information and Secrecy.\n\"The metal sensing brushes also seemed to have been meant only for slow and\ndependable tabulators. As quick-fixes were made to those parts, more oil leaks\ndeveloped on the prototypes. Those problems raised such fears about the\nproduction model's design that assembly was halted. The situation was so grave\nthat all message processing at Dayton was suspended.\"\n\nAnd the news would grow worse for Joe Desch and his team before it got better.\n\nJUNE 18, 1943\n\nThe order from Naval intelligence seemed unreal. The Navy wanted a whole new\nBombe design, with an automatic method of switching rotors and greater machine\nspeeds \u2014 and with no delays in production.\n\nDesch was stunned. In effect, the Navy wanted a machine approaching the\ncomplexity of a modern computer.\n\nLeading theorists knew even then that electronic digital processing would\nbecome the basis for modern computers, but more practical types like Desch,\nwho knew the limits of industrial production, also realized that it would take\nyears to put such a machine into operation.\n\nDesch had been right. \"There was no practical, high-speed substitute for the\nmany hard-wired rotor wheels that could be rearranged on the Bombe's drive\nspindles,\" Burke wrote. \"Thousands of tubes in very dense circuits would be\nneeded to imitate all possible rotor wiring on the 64 wheels on a Bombe.\"\n\nDesch also realized that the miniature electronic tubes at the time, unlike\ntoday's microchips, simply weren't reliable enough to do the job.\n\nHe protested to Meader, who usually went along with whatever his naval\nsuperiors wanted. This time, Meader supported Desch. He dashed off a rejection\nletter, telling the Navy brass \"that too much money had already been invested,\ntoo much precious material had been used and that the first model was too\nclose to production to be thrown aside,\" Burke wrote.\n\nThe Navy had little choice but to renew its faith in Desch and hope that his\n100 machines, when they finally reached Washington, would do the job.\n\nBy the last week of July, 15 Bombes had been assembled at NCR \u2014 but none would\nwork properly for long.\n\nIt was perhaps Desch's darkest hour. The Navy was ready to scrap the project:\na year of intensive work and millions of dollars were about to be declared a\nwaste. But Desch relied again on his practical bent to save the day. \"At the\nvery last minute, he made a discovery that revived hope,\" Burke wrote.\n\"Running the Bombe's Bakelite code wheels at extreme speeds was again causing\ninvisible distortions, leading to false electrical contacts. Desch predicted\nthat careful storage, handling and refurbishing would solve the problem.\"\n\nAgain, the Navy trusted in his judgment, and the project was spared.\n\nSEPTEMBER, 1943\n\nAlthough no one knew for certain that the NCR Bombes would work in the long\nrun, Desch's optimism \u2014 and a mounting fear of the Nazi submarine wolfpacks \u2014\nled Meader to ship the first of 120 machines to Washington before testing was\ncomplete.\n\nA covered annex was added from the rear entrance of Building 26 to the\nrailroad tracks, where the machines were loaded on flatcars in the dead of\nnight. In Washington, they were unloaded at a top-secret complex on Nebraska\nAvenue near Tenley Square, once the campus of a prestigious all-girls' school.\nInside deceptively quaint old dormitories of ivy-covered brick, the Navy ran\nthe massive codebreaking effort it had taken over from the British.\n\nMany of the WAVES based in Dayton, including Catherine Racz, went along as\noperators. Racz was one of the four-person teams assigned to each of the 120\nmachines, lined up in long, noisy rows in Building 4. The teams got \"menus\"\nfrom Naval intelligence, with beginning rotor positions and plugboard settings\nand a string of encrypted message whose plain text either was known or\nsuspected. Each Bombe was the equivalent of running 16 Enigma machines in\nreverse at extremely high speeds. The more urgent a message, the more Bombes\nwere assigned to crack it.\n\nWhenever a machine scored a hit, \"a bell went off and all the big shots showed\nup\" to retrieve the print-out of the machine's wheel positions, Racz recalled.\n\"Evidently it was something important. But we didn't even know then what we\nwere doing. We just did what we were told.\"\n\nDespite the earlier problems with the machines, they were eventually tweaked\nto the point of reliability, said Bochicchio, who set up the Bombes once they\nreached Washington. All the machines continued to leak small amounts of oil,\nhe said, but by using thicker lubricant and reducing the oil pressure inside\nthe machines, the problem was minimized.\n\n\"We knew we could do it,\" Bochicchio said. \"You try one way, then another. It\njust takes time.\"\n\nBy December, when all 120 machines were operating, the Desch Bombe was proving\nitself worthy of the Navy's investment. Consider that in June 1943, when the\nfirst machines were under development, it took an average of 600 hours to\ndecrypt an Enigma naval message. From December 1943 until the end of the war,\nwhen all 120 machines came on line, it took an average of just 18 hours.\n\n\"As important,\" Burke wrote, \"Desch's Bombes proved to be very, very reliable.\nAfter their first shakedown runs they could be used 24 hours a day.\"\n\nEven though the final product wasn't as fast as had been hoped \u2014 the speed of\nthe Bombe's main wheel had to be slowed from 3,600 rpms to 1,725 rpms to keep\nit from warping and breaking apart \u2014 the Desch design sported several striking\ninnovations, including \"a digital electronic tracking and control system that\nastounded the Navy's engineers,\" according to Burke.\n\nDesch's automatic braking and reverse feature, though pooh-poohed by British\ncodebreaking pioneer Alan Turing, worked reliably and enabled the operator to\nrestart the search for consistencies within the message without delay once a\nhit had been made.\n\n\"Despite all the false starts, delays and problems,\" Burke wrote, \"Desch had\nbuilt one of the most complex machines in the world.\"\n\nThe NCR machine was 200 times faster than the original Polish Bomba and at\nleast 20 times faster than the Turing Bombe. The Desch design ran 30 percent\nfaster than even Britain's 1943 version of a four-wheel Bombe, with a number\nof other advantages, including the ability to run more than one test per run.\n\nThe Brits at last recognized their effectiveness, as well as the abilities of\nU.S. Navy codebreakers, and handed over most of the deciphering operations in\nthe Atlantic to the Americans.\n\nHistorians differ over how much the Bombe shortened the war. But by even the\nmost conservative estimates, the Ultra codebreaking effort, including the NCR\nBombe, lopped at least a year off the fighting, sparing hundreds of thousands\nof lives on both sides of the conflict, Burke said.\n\nSunday: Bringing the truth to light\n\nContact Jim DeBrosse at 225-2437 or e-mail jim_debrosse@coxohio.com\n\n[From the Dayton Daily News: 03.05.2001] PART EIGHT OF EIGHT\n\n## Enigma\n\nSuccess comes, but at huge cost to Desch\n\nBy Jim DeBrosse Dayton Daily News\n\nNOVEMBER 1944 Joe Desch knew as he handed the decoded message to Esther\nHottenstein, the WAVE in charge of sending secret dispatches to Washington,\nthat its contents would mean the deaths of thousands of defenseless men. The\nNov. 14 intercept requested an air escort for two convoys transporting the\nJapanese 23rd Infantry Division from Manchuria to Luzon. It gave their precise\nlocation.\n\nU.S. Navy submarines, seeking revenge for the savage kamikaze attacks in the\nBattle of Leyte Gulf just weeks before, would be lying in ambush, ready to\nsend the troop ships and their escorts to the bottom of the Philippine Sea.\n\nThe gentlemanly rules of engagement Desch had learned so well as a young ROTC\ncadet at the University of Dayton had lost their meaning during the war.\nSurprise and vengeance had been the name of the game since Pearl Harbor. It\nseemed to Desch the madness and cruelty would never end.\n\nHe snapped. After long months of 14-hour days and impossible production\ndeadlines, he handed the deciphered intercept to Hottenstein, told her to send\nit by secure telegraph line to Washington, then walked out of NCR's Building\n26 determined never to come back.\n\nTailed by his security \"shadows,\" Desch drove to a friend's farm outside\nXenia, where he set himself to a simple, thought-numbing task: splitting wood.\n\n\"He knew it was war, and he had a sense of duty, but I think he had been on\nthe edge for quite a while from all the stress of his work,\" Debbie Anderson\nsaid of her father. She said he talked to her only a few times about his\nbreakdown, once after her mother had died of throat cancer in 1971 and again\nafter Anderson, who lives in Kettering, had become a mother herself. \"It was\nvery hard to get him to talk about anything related to the war,\" she said.\n\nFor the next six weeks, Desch drove out nearly every day to the farm and\nchopped wood \u2014 until a Navy intelligence official from Washington approached\nhim there and pleaded with him to return. He told Desch that his country\ndesperately needed him. Only Desch had the expertise to tackle some problems\nthat had arisen in cracking Japanese codes. He had to come back.\n\nDesch complied, but on the condition that his hours would be limited. And he\ninsisted that Lt. Cmdr. Ralph Meader \u2014 the officer placed by the Navy in\nDesch's own home, to keep a security eye on his activities \u2014 be sent to live\nsomeplace else.\n\nBut on that, the Navy wouldn't budge. Meader would stay in Desch's cottage\nuntil early 1946, well after the war had ended, and he would leave his beat-up\nNash Rambler in the driveway for Desch to dispose of on his own.\n\nDesch recovered enough from his breakdown to finish the Japanese codebreaking\nwork, but his assistant, Bob Mumma, was put in charge of the U.S. Naval\nMachine Computing Laboratory for the remainder of the war. Later, Desch\ncontinued his vacuum-tube research at NCR and eventually become an assistant\nvice president. Whether he ever headed another top-secret project is anyone's\nguess.\n\nEven so, his expertise in electronics and cryptanalysis was respected enough\nthat he was named a consultant to the National Research Council on submarine\nwarfare and sat on a special advisory committee to the Secretary of Defense\nfor several years after the war. For at least two decades, he was part of the\nadvisory board to the National Security Agency.\n\nDesch also got the Congressional Medal for Merit \u2014 the highest award given to\ncivilians for exceptional service to the country. Because of the nature of his\nwork, he received the award privately at the Navy Department in 1947.\n\nJust as privately, like millions of other American men and women who gave\ntheir all during the war and survived, Desch forever carried the emotional\nscars of his service. \"It was truly tragic, the pressure they were under\" in\nthe top Navy intelligence circles, Anderson said. \"But other guys got killed.\nIt was just a different form of sacrifice.\"\n\nSoon after the war, Desch learned that nearly every member of the Army\nordnance unit in which he had been commissioned had either been killed or\nwounded in action. But Desch had been pulled from the unit before he could be\nshipped out \u2014 to serve what the Navy had felt was a more important duty.\n\nIn his darkest moments, Anderson said, her father used to say, \"I would much\nrather have been with them.\"\n\nMAY 7, 1945: V-E DAY Evelyn Vogel will never forget that evening, how it\nstarted raining and wouldn't stop \u2014 and yet the rain couldn't dampen the\nspirit of celebration. Thousands of revelers, including WAVES like Vogel,\nheaded downtown to drink, dance and run crazily through the puddles.\n\n\"Commander Meader said we (WAVES) were all free to leave camp and go downtown\nand join the celebration, but to remember our manners,\" Vogel said. \"Anyway,\nwe all went downtown and I had never seen such a scene. Rain all over, but\npeople were shouting and laughing and, of course, open bottles were being\npassed around.\"\n\nVogel ran into some other WAVES downtown, and they headed back to the closest\nthing they knew to their family home \u2014 the Desch's cottage on Greenmount\nAvenue. \"They seemed glad to see us when we got there,\" Vogel said. \"But I'm\nsure everybody took their shoes off because they were all muddy.\"\n\nIt's hard to know how much Joe Desch savored the victory that night, and\nwhether he had properly gauged the significance of his contribution to ending\nthe war. Certainly, he knew the battle in the Pacific would carry on, with\neven more loss of life. Although he had already withdrawn from military work\nto conduct his own research at NCR, Desch would be part of one of the most\nbrutal and decisive acts of the war \u2014 without even realizing it.\n\nThe atom bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki late that summer were\ndeveloped with the help of high-speed electronic counters he had designed\nearlier in the war. Desch had built the counters for the University of\nChicago, personally delivering them to Edward Teller, who \u2014 unknown to Desch \u2014\nwas directing the top-secret Manhattan Project at the time.\n\nBut for the young revelers at the Desch home that night, all they really knew\nwas that the fighting in Europe had finally ended and that they would soon be\nseeing their loved ones.\n\n\"We danced on the front lawn in the rain until midnight,\" Vogel said. \"And we\ndid forget our manners.\"\n\nMAY 1958 In the color home movie, Debbie Anderson, then a second-grader at St.\nAlbert the Great, is decked out in her First Communion dress and seated\nbetween her mother and father on the living room sofa. Her father, a proud\nsmile on his face, leafs through her Communion prayer book.\n\nLater, in the same movie, Desch, his mother and his two sisters dine in\ncelebration around the dining room table, the estrangement of the war years\nlong forgotten.\n\n\"I remember it was always really hard for Dad's family to relax with us \u2014\nexcept for that day,\" Anderson said. \"Everything went right and everybody was\nin a good mood.\"\n\nAnderson would learn later it was also the day that her father had received\nthe Blessed Sacrament for the first time since 1943, when, in the midst of his\nguilt and frustration over not being to perfect the Bombe, he had quit going\nto church.\n\nDesch reconciled with his faith just days before Anderson's First Communion,\nafter he had given his confession to Father George Steinkamp, who had been his\nreligious mentor at Emmanuel Elementary School.\n\nSteinkamp, in his 70s and in poor health by the late 1950s, was the only\npriest with whom Desch felt close enough to unburden his soul.\n\n\"Dad called him up personally and asked him if they would make a special\narrangement for Dad to go to confession,\" Anderson said. \"Father Steinkamp was\nso frail at this time he couldn't walk from the rectory down into the church.\nSo Dad picked him up and carried him into the church and set him in the\nconfessional. Remember, this was the 1950s. You had to use a confessional.\"\n\nCarl Rench, 79, a former NCR engineer and Desch's closest friend after the\nwar, said that, by the late 1950s, Desch had found a measure of peace within\nhimself, as well as a deep religious conviction. Often in those days, he and\nDesch would debate each other's interpretations of the New Testament.\n\n\"He was a Catholic and I was a Protestant, and we had a lot of fun doing\nthat,\" Rench said. \"We went through everything Mark, Luke and John ever wrote\nabout. We even compared some of the stories, I remember.\"\n\nRench said there was no question that Desch was a different man in 1958 than\nhe was in 1946, when Rench first began to work for him. \"We were both trying\nto behave the way Jesus would want us to behave,\" he said. \"Joe was very\nsatisfied with his feelings about the church and the Bible. And I got the\nsense that he was very proud of what he had been able to accomplish, finally,\nduring the war.\"\n\nYet none of the men and women who had worked so hard on the NCR Bombe has ever\nsought credit or recognition for their contribution, including the four NCR\nengineers most intimately involved in its design \u2014 Joe Desch, Bob Mumma, Lou\nSandor and Vince Gulden. \"We worked hard and we worked long hours but I wasn't\nout anywhere where I was being shot at,\" said Sandor, 86, a resident of\nColumbia, S.C. \"Those were the guys really out there doing the tough job.\"\n\nSEPT. 14, 1995 Evelyn Einfeldt recalled sitting in the lobby of the Marriott\nHotel and being amazed that, after 50 years, she could still recognize her\nfellow WAVES as they trickled in for their reunion weekend in Dayton.\n\n\"It was so much fun. We would wait for them to come in the door and, after all\nthese years, it was like nothing had really changed,\" Einfeldt said.\n\nNot true for Dayton, however. Evelyn Vogel noticed, sadly, how much downtown\nhad changed since the war. \"It was a vital, exciting city back then \u2014 a \u2018going\nJenny,\u2019 to use a Missouri term, back in 1944 and '45 and '46. And then to see\nit in 1995, deader than a mackerel \u2014 you couldn't help but shed a few tears.\"\n\nVogel, and many of the other 65 WAVES who had returned to Dayton, also were\nsaddened to see that so much of NCR and Sugar Camp had vanished since the war.\n\"The (NCR) buildings along Main Street \u2014 almost all of them were gone. You\njust don't expect that to be,\" she said. \"And the historical value of Sugar\nCamp, as far as I was concerned, was almost lost. There was only one cabin\nleft\" among the 60 the WAVES had shared during their stay in Dayton.\n\n\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Poor old John Patterson would have wept also if he had\nknown that everything had been taken down,\u2019 \u201d Vogel said.\n\nA big reason Debbie Anderson organized a reunion of the WAVES \u2014 with help from\nCarillon Historical Park, the Air Force Museum and NCR \u2014 was to call attention\nto what was left of the NCR war experience before all traces of it were gone.\n\n\"AT&T had taken over NCR at the time, and a lot of people were mortally afraid\nthey were going to destroy the (NCR) archives as a cost-saving measure,\" she\nsaid. AT&T acquired NCR in 1991, only to spin the company off on its own again\nin 1996.\n\n\"I don't know what made me think the WAVES might want a reunion,\" Anderson\nsaid. \"I didn't know a single WAVE at the time.\"\n\nBut once again fate intervened, this time in the form of a phone call from\nDayton Daily News reporter James Cummings, who had seen a brief mention of NCR\nand the WAVES during a Nova special on PBS called The Codebreakers.\n\nCummings interviewed Anderson and NCR archivist Bill West about the WAVES and\nmentioned the plans for organizing a reunion in Dayton. With the article's\npublication in April 1994, scores of former WAVES all over the country came\nforward to be counted. In all, 65 WAVES would make their way back to Dayton,\nalong with another 150 or so family members.\n\nSpeakers at the four-day event included Jeff Greenhut, a Naval intelligence\nhistorian; Margaret Fiehtner, assistant chief of staff, Naval Security Group\nCommand, based at the Nebraska Avenue complex in Washington, D.C., where the\nNCR machines had done their decoding work during the war, and Colin Burke,\nformer historian in residence at the National Security Agency who first\ndetailed NCR's struggle to break the Enigma Code in his 1994 book Information\nand Secrecy .\n\nThe NCR Bombe was an American industrial triumph, Burke said, in a city that\ngave birth to aviation and many other technological innovations. \"You have a\nhell of an important place there in Dayton.\" As more government documents are\nreleased, Burke said, the contributions that NCR and Joe Desch made toward\nabbreviating World War II will eventually find their way into the mainstream\nof historical knowledge.\n\nTo help give it another push, the WAVES are planning a second reunion in\nDayton for this October. Einfeldt, one of the organizers, expects a small but\nvery dedicated turn-out. \"So many of us are older and don't get around as much\nanymore,\" she said. \"But we'll be there.\"\n\nOnce the world knows more about NCR's contributions to the Ultra effort, the\nquestion becomes, will anything be left standing in Dayton as memorials?\n\nNCR has retained one of the 60 Adirondack-style cabins in Sugar Camp that\nhoused the WAVES, as well as the dining hall and auditorium. All three wooden\nstructures are used for storage and office space. \"There are no plans to\nremove them or do anything else with them,\" said NCR spokesman John Horrigan.\n\nBut the fate of Building 26, where the NCR Bombe was designed and built, is\nanother matter.\n\nNCR is reviewing the status of its real estate holdings worldwide. So far, no\ndecision has been made about Building 26, Horrigan said.\n\n\"Certainly, the building doesn't look anything like it did during the war,\" he\nsaid. All that remains of the original exterior is the rear wall and entrance.\nThe front and sides of the old building are now enveloped by additions, and\nmost of the interior space has been reconfigured as well. Still, Horrigan\nsaid, NCR officials are aware of the building's historical significance and\nhave been discussing how they might recognize it.\n\nAnderson and local members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics\nEngineers are in the process of obtaining a plaque designating the building as\na milestone in the development of the modern computer. But more than that, the\none thing that would speak volumes for Dayton's contribution to the war is an\nactual NCR Bombe. What became of the more than 120 Bombes that were designed\nand built in Dayton? Is it true that all but one have vanished?\n\nThe four Bombe prototypes were the first to disappear, dumped and buried\nsomewhere near the NCR complex during the war. Some say in an old canal bed\nnear the Montgomery County Fairgrounds. Others say underneath the parking lot\nnear Building 26. Desch himself told his daughter they were underneath the\npavement of Patterson Boulevard. There are no records to support anyone's\nclaims.\n\nNaval and intelligence officials say the working machines that reached\nWashington, D.C. were dumped at night into the Chesapeake Bay. But Phil\nBochicchio, the floor engineer in charge of setting up and maintaining the\nmachines in Washington, said he was ordered to ship six Bombes to a Navy\nwarehouse in Mechanicsburg, Pa., soon after the war.\n\nNSA officials insist they know of no other Bombes except the one now on\ndisplay at its National Cryptologic Museum in Ft. Meade, Md.\n\nThe machines sent to the naval warehouse \"were probably just excessed and\ndestroyed. A lot of things up there were excessed and destroyed,\" said Jack\nIngram, curator of the museum. \"We don't have any records on it.\"\n\nThe lone NCR Bombe was first displayed in the NSA lobby in the 1980s, then\nexhibited at the Smithsonian in 1989 before being moved to the cryptologic\nmuseum, which the NSA had opened near its headquarters.\n\nIf, by any chance, there is another NCR Bombe out there somewhere, Dayton\nwould like to have one for its still-unnamed regional history museum, set to\nopen inside Memorial Hall in late 2004. NCR's role in developing the modern\ncomputer \"will be one of the main attractions (of the new museum),\" said Brian\nHackett, executive director of the Montgomery County Historical Society.\n\"Certainly, a Bombe would be the jewel in that crown.\"\n\nAUGUST 1987 Joe Desch had been living by himself, quietly in his West\nKettering home, for several months. He'd moved back there in June after six\nmonths in assisted living and nine months in a nursing home, where he'd made a\nremarkable recovery from hip surgery and a series of small strokes.\n\nDebbie Anderson recalled the way her father, glancing back at the nursing home\non his way to the car, \"stuck out his jaw and said, 'Not many people walk out\nof that place.' He was very proud he'd been able to do that. He really wanted\nto die at home.\" He spent his final months there contented and active. Friends\nand family dropped in frequently, and he spent many hours talking on his ham\nradio.\n\nOn Aug. 3, 1987, when Anderson called her father and got no answer, she knew\nsomething was wrong. She and her husband drove to his home. His morning paper\nwas still in the driveway. They found him on the floor beside his bed \u2014 partly\nparalyzed and speechless from a stroke.\n\nAnderson and her husband spent the day with her father at Kettering Medical\nCenter, where he would die that evening in intensive care.\n\n\"That's exactly how he wanted to go,\" she said. \"He wanted to be in his own\nhome and he wanted to go quickly.\"\n\nBut Anderson said she couldn't help feeling cheated by his death. \"I know this\nis selfish and petty, but I can remember thinking once or twice that day,\nwhatever happened during the war, he knows, he still knows, and we're not\ngoing to get a thing,\" she said. \"I thought, damn it, it's going to be lost.\nHe never told anybody. He never wrote it down.\"\n\nJust before he died at 5:30 that evening, \"I could sense he was trying to\nspeak,\" Anderson said. When his time came, \"he didn't fight it,\" she said.\n\nAnderson would go on to poke and prod at the walls of secrecy that had been\nput up around her father's place in history. She would find her own\nreconciliation with her family's contribution to the war. But she still\ndoesn't know for sure what kind of peace her father had found.\n\nHis death, like so much of his life, was cloaked in mystery.\n\n\"I don't think at the end he figured it all out. Who does?\" she said. \"But he\nhad accepted it just the same.\"\n\nContact Jim DeBrosse at 225-2437 or e-mail jim_debrosse@coxohio.com\n\n## Book\n\nThe secret in Building 26, Jim DeBrosse & Colin Burke, Random House, 2004,\nISBN 0-375-50807-4\n\n## Web Page\n\nDayton Codebreakers - historical papers, info about the \"Dayton Codebreakers\"\nmovie on DVD, etc. Navy Contract NXs7892, TOP SECRET report by R.I.
