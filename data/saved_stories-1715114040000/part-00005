Code words\ncan thwart this deception\n\nBy Ben Guarino\n\nTero Vesalainen/Getty Images\n\nThe most common fraud in the U.S. over the past year was the impostor scam.\nMore than 856,000 instances, collectively draining $2.7 billion nationwide,\nwere reported to the Federal Trade Commission in 2023. First, swindlers fake\nfamiliarity or authority\u2014maybe by stealing the identity of a friend or\nrelative or claiming to be a bank representative or a federal agent. Then, in\nthat guise, they call, text or e-mail you and attempt to take your money.\n\nAnd now artificial intelligence has larded these scams with an additional\nlayer of duplicity: inexpensive voice-cloning services that an impersonator\ncan easily abuse to make deceptive\u2014and astonishingly convincing\u2014phone calls in\nanother person\u2019s voice. These AI tools digest speech samples (perhaps snatched\nfrom videos posted online or from a supposedly \u201cwrong number\u201d phone call) and\ngenerate audio replicas of the stolen voice that can be manipulated to say\nbasically anything.\n\nIf there were a golden rule to thwart AI-infused phone scams, it might be\nsomething like this: Online or on the phone, treat your family members and\nfriends as though they were an e-mail log-in page. Make up a passcode\u2014a safe\nword or private phrase\u2014and share it with them in person. Memorize it. If they\ncall you in alarm or under unusual pressure, especially if those concerns are\nconnected to requests for money, ask for the code to verify who is on the\nother end of the line.\n\nAdopting a computerlike countermeasure for a problem enabled by computer\nalgorithms is admittedly an unnatural practice. It is a human impulse to trust\na family member\u2019s voice, said Jennifer DeStefano, a target of an attempted\nscam, to a Senate judiciary subcommittee last June. Perpetrators had called\nher phone, claimed her then 15-year-old daughter was kidnapped and demanded a\nransom. The plot fell apart when DeStefano learned her child was safe on a ski\ntrip\u2014but only after DeStefano had at first been thoroughly deceived by an AI\nmimic of her daughter\u2019s voice. \u201cHow many times has a loved one reached out to\nyou in despair and you stopped them to validate their identity?\u201d she wrote in\nher testimony. \u201cThe answer is, more than likely, never.\u201d\n\nUsing a verbal password or code phrase may simply be the most straightforward\nway to combat AI voice scams. \u201cI like the code word idea because it is simple\nand, assuming the callers have the clarity of mind to remember to ask,\nnontrivial to subvert,\u201d says Hany Farid, a professor at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, who has studied audio deepfakes. \u201cRight now there is no\nother obvious way to know that the person you are talking to is who they say\nthey are.\u201d Farid and his wife have a code word. His pro tip: \u201cAsk each other\nwhat the code is every once in a while\u2014because unlike a [computer] password,\nwe don\u2019t use the code word very often, so it is easy to forget.\u201d\n\nWith scam fears and dangers becoming such a prominent part of technology news,\nmany of the staff at Scientific American have established safe words, too.\nHere\u2019s what some of our editors had to say about choosing a memorable and\nefficient code:\n\nMy family has had an all-purpose code word since I was a kid. It was\noriginally developed to keep me from being kidnapped in the car line in\nelementary school, though I don\u2019t think we ever had to use it. The idea was\nthat if someone showed up to pick me up claiming that they were sent by my\nparents, I should ask them for the code word. Nowadays the code word mostly\nexists to make sure my parents don\u2019t get scammed by someone pretending to be\nme. \u2014Allison Parshall, associate news editor\n\nEstablishing a code word with my parents was fairly easy\u2014we had one from\nmiddle and high school that was easy to reuse. It was harder to coordinate one\nwith my partner. For each suggestion, he provided an imaginary situation in\nwhich hostage-takers could use the word without even knowing its secret\nmeaning. We\u2019re still working to find one that\u2019s foolproof. In the meantime,\nI\u2019m reminding friends and family that, when in doubt, driving in person to the\nbank or the police department is more reliable than trusting a voice over the\nphone claiming to work for either place! \u2014Arminda Downey-Mavromatis, associate\nengagement editor\n\nMy wife and I settled on a pet name that one of us has for the other that was\nhistorically reserved for when we\u2019re being twee and annoying (and now, I\nguess, vigilant). With my brother\u2014because I do not have a cutesy nickname for\nhim\u2014our defense is rooted in the fact we\u2019re never far from our phone. I\ngenerated a QR code that we both linked to a one-time password authenticator\napp. One of us begins the challenge by asking, \u201cHey, buddy, what\u2019s your\nnumber?\u201d The correct answer is the first three digits of the six-digit code\ndisplayed in the authenticator app. Then the original challenger reads out the\nlast three numbers. A match is a strong indicator that all parties involved\nare who they say. \u2014Ben Guarino, associate editor, technology\n\nAfter reading a scary article about these scams, I contacted my parents and my\nsister, and we all agreed on a code word based on a funny family lore story\nabout my dad\u2019s childhood. Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to remember it if someone\never tries to ensnare us in one of these! \u2014Clara Moskowitz, senior editor,\nspace and physics\n\nFor a while now, I\u2019ve been worried about scammers using generative AI to mimic\nmy or a family member\u2019s voice to scam us out of our money. So when news\nstories started to confirm that this was actually happening, I told my family\nthat we should make a code word or phrase that we could use to know it was\nreally us. I suggested a question-and-answer pair based on something only our\nfamily would know, and one of my family members immediately blurted out the\nanswer in a group text, necessitating a new one. That kicked off a thread\nwhere we proceeded to list different family memories and in-jokes, some of\nwhich even we didn\u2019t know the answer to! It was a fun trip down memory lane.\n\u2014Tanya Lewis, senior editor, health and medicine\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nBen Guarino is an associate technology editor at Scientific American.
