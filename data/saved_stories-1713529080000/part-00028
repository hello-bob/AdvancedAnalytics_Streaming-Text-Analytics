He was 80.\n\nThe Rock & Roll Hall of Famer died at his home in Osprey, Florida, David\nSpero, Betts\u2019 manager of 20 years, confirmed. Betts had been diagnosed with\ncancer and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Spero said.\n\n\u201cHe was surrounded by his whole family and he passed peacefully. They didn\u2019t\nthink he was in any pain,\u201d Spero said by phone.\n\nBetts shared lead guitar duties with Duane Allman in the original Allman\nBrothers Band to help give the group its distinctive sound and create a new\ngenre \u2013 southern rock. Acts including Lynyrd Skynyrd, Kid Rock, Phish and\nJason Isbell \u2013 among many others \u2013 were influenced by the Allmans\u2019 music,\nwhich combined the blues, country, R&B and jazz with 60s rock.\n\nFounded in 1969, the Allmans were a pioneering jam band, trampling the\ntraditional notion of three-minute pop songs by performing lengthy\ncompositions in concert and on record. The band was also notable as a biracial\ngroup from the deep south.\n\nDuane Allman died in a motorcycle accident in 1971, and founding member Berry\nOakley was killed in a motorcycle crash a year later. That left Betts and\nAllman\u2019s younger brother Gregg as the band\u2019s leaders, but they frequently\nclashed, and substance abuse caused further dysfunction. The band broke up at\nleast twice before reforming, and has had more than a dozen lineups.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in\n1995 and earned a lifetime achievement Grammy award in 2012. Betts left the\ngroup for good in 2000, and also played solo and with his own band Great\nSouthern, which included his son, guitarist Duane Betts.\n\nThe group released a self-titled debut album in 1969. A year later came the\nalbum Idlewild South, highlighted by Betts\u2019 instrumental composition In Memory\nof Elizabeth Reed, which soon became a concert staple.\n\nMembers of the Allman Brothers Band in an undated photo.

Photograph: AP\n\nThe 1971 double album At Fillmore East, now considered among the greatest live\nalbums of the classic rock era, was the Allmans\u2019 commercial breakthrough and\ncemented their performing reputation by showcasing the unique guitar interplay\nbetween Allman and Betts.\n\nThe group also had two drummers \u2013 \u201cJaimoe\u201d Johanson, who is Black, and Butch\nTrucks.\n\nDuane Allman died four days after Fillmore was certified as a gold record, but\nthe band carried on and crowds continued to grow. The 1973 album Brothers and\nSisters rose to No 1 on the charts and featured Ramblin\u2019 Man, with Betts\nsinging the lead and bringing twang to the Top 40. The song reached No 2 on\nthe singles charts and was kept out of the No 1 spot by Half Breed by Cher,\nwho later married Gregg Allman.\n\nThe soaring sound of Betts\u2019 guitar on Ramblin\u2019 Man reverberated in\nneighborhood bars around the country for decades, and the song underscored his\nknack for melodic hooks. Ramblin\u2019 Man was the Allmans\u2019 only top 10 hit, but\nBetts\u2019 catchy seven-and-a-half-minute instrumental composition Jessica,\nrecorded in 1972, became an FM radio staple.\n\nBetts also wrote or co-wrote some of the band\u2019s other best-loved songs,\nincluding Blue Sky and Southbound. In later years the group remained a\nsuccessful touring act with Betts and Warren Haynes on guitar. Gregg Allman\nand Butch Trucks died in 2017.\n\nAfter leaving the Allmans for good, Betts continued to play with his own group\nand lived in the Bradenton area with his wife, Donna.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Music\n  * Pop and rock\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
