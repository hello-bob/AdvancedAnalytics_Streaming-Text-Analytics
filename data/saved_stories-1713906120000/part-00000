In physics, the\nsmallest particles possible exhibit the strange phenomenon of being both\nmatter and wave simultaneously. Yes, we\u2019re talking about light, which is\nelectromagnetic energy. And this leads us directly to optics and photonics,\nthe branch of technology concerned with the properties and transmission of\nphotons, that is light particles, for example in fiber optics or lasers.\n\nThe other area that is all about the movement of tiny amounts of electrical\nenergy is the design and manufacture of microchips and microcircuits. One way\nto speed them up is to have the electric signal within a microchip move\nfaster, perhaps even as fast as the speed of light. In optoelectronics, for\nexample, light is used to excite the electrons in semiconductors.\n\nSo quantum technology (QT) is all about light and really small particles, and\nthe applications have to do with computers, sensor technology, communications,\nas well as optical technology. Actually, the potential range of applications\nis huge, from photovoltaic to healthcare, telecommunication to industrial\nmanufacturing, encryption to metrology, that is measurement, and not least,\nlogistics.\n\nGenerally speaking, when people refer to quantum tech or quantum electronics,\nthey are currently still talking about scientific research, whereas people\ninvolved in photonics are in the engineering or application stage. One of\nBerlin\u2019s great strengths is the wealth of connections between the many world-\nclass scientific institutions in town and the tech and business sector,\ncreating transfers that ultimately lead to products. Berlin is in the process\nof positioning itself extremely well in the relatively new field of quantum\ntechnologies.\n\n## Berlin\u2019s Quantum Initiative\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in photonics in Berlin, your first port of call should be\nBerlin Partner\u2019s cluster management optics and photonics Berlin Brandenburg. A\nwhile ago we spoke with cluster manager Gerrit R\u00f6ssler for an article we\ncalled Berlin \u2013 City of Light. Since then, Berlin\u2019s quantum ecosystem, that is\nBerlin's business community, research institutions and universities, have got\ntogether to form BERLIN QUANTUM. The state government sees so much potential\nin this sector that it is providing \u20ac25M in funding for four years. Thomas\nKrause, who heads the department of Energy, Digitalization and Industry in the\nSenate, said simply, quantum technologies are \u201cthe next big thing\u201d.\n\nThe funds are to be used to strengthen the already existing expertise as well\nas to attract talents in the field from all over the world, for example to\nencourage basic research but also to initiate innovative business ideas. The\noriginal concept for this initiative comes from the Berlin University\nAlliance, an association including the three major Berlin universities and the\nCharit\u00e9, with contributions from two Fraunhofer institutions, Heinrich-Hertz-\nInstitute and Fraunhofer FOKUS, all with great expertise in quantum\ntechnology. The three universities are:\n\n  * The Free University (FU)\n  * The Technical University (TU)\n  * The Humboldt University (HU)\n\nFurthemore, the Einstein Foundation as an independent institution promotes\nscience and research in and for Berlin at the highest international level, for\ninstance with their Einstein Research Unit. Professorships in the field of\nquantum technologies (computing and communication) have already been funded.\nNew professorships are to be created as part of Berlin Quantum.\n\nWe asked Prof. Arno Rauschenbeutel, professor at HU Berlin and spokesperson of\nBERLIN QUANTUM, what makes Berlin such a quantum hotspot.\n\n> \u201cBerlin is an internationally renowned hotspot for cutting-edge research in\n> the field of quantum technologies. The location is characterized by a broad\n> spectrum of expertises (quantum communication, sensors, computing and key\n> technologies in photonics, microelectronics and software) represented by\n> excellent scientists in both fundamental and applied research. BERLIN\n> QUANTUM not only promotes QT research, but also drives the technology\n> transfer from the laboratory to real application.\u201d\n\nOne of the first things the BERLIN QUANTUM did was send a large official\ndelegation to the Quantum World Congress in Washington D.C.. The trip was a\nchance to meet with the likes of NASA at the Goddard Space Flight Center, IBM,\nBoeing, and quantum firms such as IonQ, Q-CTRL (see below), or Infleqtion.\nMany of the delegates were greeted as friends and business partners by the\ncompanies they visited. For instance, Claus Heitman, CEO of Toptica Eagleyard,\nbased in Adlershof Berlin, was delighted to see his company's lasers being\nused in research labs and in production facilities at IonQ.\n\nThe BERLIN QUANTUM delegation stateside, at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center\n\u2013 \u00a9 Berlin Partner\n\nSpeaking of Adlershof, a new innovation hub and coworking space for quantum\ntechnologies was recently unveiled at the Berlin Adlershof Innovation and\nstartup center: the Leap. It provides workspace and event space, in short a\nhub for exchange, networking and collaboration between actors from science,\nbusiness and the startup scene addressing the potentials and challenges of\nquantum technologies. There is even free space for new startups who want to\ntake a look at Berlin's quantum ecosystem. The Leap provides 600 m2 including\ncoworking space (featuring an attractive terrace) specifically for quantum\ntechnologies on the top floor of the Berlin Adlershof startup center.\n\nAlso in Adlershof is the DLR\u2019s (German Aerospace Center) Institute of Optical\nSensor Systems, for whom quantum technologies are vital.\n\nLeibniz\u2019 Ferdinand-Braun-Institut (FBH) is very active in the field of modern\nquantum components. Together with Humboldt University Berlin and others, they\nrun several joint labs that deal with the various aspects of quantum\ntechnologies, working on state-of-the-art laser technologies, including\ngenerating a special state of matter called a Bose Einstein condensate.\nMeanwhile, the Leibniz Institute for Crystal Growth (IKZ) is working on spin\nqubits for quantum computers and is shining light on various aspects of novel\nmaterials for quantum technologies.\n\nOther Berlin institutes active in the quantum sphere are:\n\n  * the Dahlem Center for Complex Quantum Systems\n  * the Max Born Institute for Nonlinear Optics and Short Pulse Spectroscopy (MBI)\n  * the research group Optoelectronics and Quantum Devices\n  * the Paul Drude Institute (PDI)\n  * the National Metrology Institute PTB, (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt)\n  * the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB)\n\nAnd of course quantum technologies are one of Fraunhofer\u2019s strategic research\nfields. They even have a quantum testbed facility. Of their Berlin locations,\nthe Institute for Open Communication Systems FOKUS and the Institute for\nTelecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institute (HHI) are deeply involved in QT.\nSo is the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration IZM, whose\nwork is essential for the transfer of the technology into real applications\nand use cases.\n\n## Quantum Businesses in Berlin\n\nHere are just some of the Berlin companies active in quantum tech:\n\nJCMwave provides nano-optic researchers with software for fast and accurate\noptical simulations.\n\nKipu Quantum offers software products for various business domains based on\napplication- and hardware-specific quantum algorithms.\n\nMenlo Systems provides complete laser systems for quantum simulations or\nquantum computing experiments.\n\nMO-SPACE is a startup located in Adlershof and also active in the area of\nencryption and secure communication. However, their solution is designed\nspecifically for space projects.\n\nPicoquant makes lasers for application in quantum technology, for example in\nexperiments on quantum gates for future quantum computers.\n\nQUARTIQ is a pioneer in the development of open hardware and software\nsolutions for quantum technology applications supplying research and metrology\ninstitutes worldwide. They also build transportable and robust optical atomic\nclocks.\n\nThe aforementioned eagleyard is the Adlershof-based subsidiary of Toptica\nPhotonics, making laser diodes for a wide range of industrial applications\nincluding automotive and aerospace technology.\n\nQuantune Technologies makes microscopic infrared laser spectrometers for\nbiomedical consumer devices and industrial applications.\n\nFor an overview of more of the quantum players in Berlin, see Quantum\nTechnology in Berlin-Brandenburg.\n\n## Berlin \u2013 An Attractive Quantum Location\n\nBerlin provides such a good quantum ecosystem that companies active in the\nsector are relocating here. For example, Australian company Nomad Atomics\nmakes quantum sensors for use in mining, underground resources, and\nnavigation. For their northern hemisphere HQ, they chose Berlin.\n\nWe asked Nomad\u2019s Co-Founder & CTO Christian Freier why they came here:\n\n> \u201cWe at Nomad Atomics are developing state-of-the-art miniaturized quantum\n> sensors that can be used specifically for mining, underground resource\n> exploration and navigation. As a start-up originally founded in Australia,\n> we chose Berlin as the hub for our European activities because it's a start-\n> up hotspot in the heart of Europe, and for the strength of its ecosystem in\n> related technologies such as optics and photonics.\u201d\n\nAlso originally Australian, Q-CTRL provides a system to make sure the hardware\nyou\u2019re using in your quantum experiments is not a source for error. The\ncompany recently opened offices in London and Berlin.\n\nUK company M Squared Laser Ltd develops components, sub-systems and sensors\nfor commercial quantum applications in the form of lasers and cutting-edge\nphotonics systems. The company claims to \u201cprovide the world\u2019s purest light\u201d.\nSome of their customers are active in healthcare, some are scientific\norganizations helping to halt climate change. M Squared have expanded their\nEuropean presence with a Berlin office.\n\n## Quantum Incentives\n\nWe have seen that quantum tech refers to much more than the buzzword \u2018quantum\ncomputing\u2019 suggests. Future supercomputers that don\u2019t rely on bits or 0s and\n1s as their basic units, but break these down into \u2018qubits\u2019, which could be in\neither state much like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, are just one aspect of quantum tech.\nQComputers will be able to handle complex problems through parallel computing\noperations that current (super)computers cannot perform or would take an\nincredibly long time to solve. So in part, the technology is being driven by\nthe hope of exponentially faster computing, which, however, entails a vital\nsecurity issue. Today, pretty much all the movement of data between servers is\nencrypted \u2013 quantum computing will be able to break all currently standard\nforms of encryption. This means that data storage and transfer must be made\nquantum-proof. Hence one application of quantum computing is being developed\nin order to protect vital business processes from the misuse of quantum\ncomputing.\n\nSince quantum will likely have massive disruptive potential in all sorts of\nsectors, Berlin is positioning itself as a leading location for quantum tech.\nAnd clearly, as we have shown, the ecosystem and transfer networks are here.\n\nTo make the move to Berlin even more attractive, the senate has regular calls\nand subsidies in the field, such as the applications oriented program Pro FIT.\n\nCompanies, startups, or consortia consisting of firms and research\ninstitutions in the quantum space should get in touch with Berlin Partner for\nsupport in finding funding opportunities for hardware or software, for\nindustrial research, for market launch, or even for experimental development.\n\nTo stay up-to-date about recent quantum developments in Berlin, it is worth\nfollowing BERLIN QUANTUM on social media (LinkedIn) and to keep an eye on the\nofficial webpage qt_berlin.\n\nText: Olaf Bryan Wielk, ideenmanufaktur Header image: \u00a9 Berlin Partner\n\n### Get news and information about Berlin\u2019s business, startup, and science\nscenes.\n\n### Sign up for the latest articles on reason-why.berlin.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nMore articles\n\n#### Show Us What You\u2019re Made of\n\nAmazing materials being developed in Berlin.\n\nLearn More\n\n#### The World\u2019s Most Efficient New Solar Cells\n\nBerlin\u2019s famous Helmholtz Center for Materials and Energy has reclaimed the\nworld record for tandem photovoltaic cells.\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Shoplifters Against The Machine\n\nThe Demons We Seeded \u2013 It Takes Real Intelligence To Program Artificial\nIntelligence\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Tell Me Who You Are \u2013 ID Sovereignty\n\nMaking logins, online purchases, and verifications safer \u2013 with a blockchain?\n\nLearn More\n\nNext\n\n#### Show Us What You\u2019re Made of\n\nAmazing materials being developed in Berlin.\n\nLearn More\n\n#### The World\u2019s Most Efficient New Solar Cells\n\nBerlin\u2019s famous Helmholtz Center for Materials and Energy has reclaimed the\nworld record for tandem photovoltaic cells.\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Shoplifters Against The Machine\n\nThe Demons We Seeded \u2013 It Takes Real Intelligence To Program Artificial\nIntelligence\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Tell Me Who You Are \u2013 ID Sovereignty\n\nMaking logins, online purchases, and verifications safer \u2013 with a blockchain?\n\nLearn More\n\nNext\n\n  * \u00a9 Reason Why Berlin\n  * Legal Notice\n  * Sitemap\n\n  * Business\n  * Startups\n  * Science\n  * Living\n  * News\n  * Events\n\nNewsletter\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n\nShare on\n\n", "frontpage": false}
