The findings suggest that one in three Americans have pirated\na movie or TV series over the past year. Costs are a key motivator for these\nself-proclaimed pirates, with the number of legal subscription services and\ntheir price tags a key trigger.\n\nFor online media consumers, things have improved significantly over the years.\nMore content is being made available on-demand than ever before.\n\nNetflix set the tone a decade ago by offering movies and TV series online as a\nconvenient alternative to piracy. This worked well, so well that more than a\ndozen other streaming services were launched, all with their own exclusive\nreleases.\n\nWhile this may sound positive, in some ways it made things worse for\nconsumers. As it turns out, it\u2019s quite costly to have more than a handful of\nsubscriptions and fees may rise to the point where people feel justified to\npirate some content to keep costs under control.\n\nThis revelation isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s been brought up several times over the years,\ndating back to at least 2017. And indeed, while most people gladly pay for\nstreaming subscriptions, many use pirate sites and services \u2018on the side\u2019 to\nincidentally watch content from services they\u2019re not already subscribed to.\n\nAcademic studies are yet to examine this effect in great detail, but there is\nsurvey data to back the theory up. Previously, most UK consumers felt that\nthey were paying too much for legal subscriptions, with half indicating that\npiracy is a viable alternative.\n\n## 1 in 3 Americans Pirated Movies or TV recently\n\nNew data from U.S. respondents released this week suggests that expensive\nstreaming subscriptions are an issue there too. The online survey, conducted\nby Cordcutting among a sample of 988 American adults, finds that a third of\nall respondents pirated TV series or movies in the past year.\n\nYounger people are more likely to have pirated at some point in their lives.\nFor example, 76% of Generation Z says they have pirated content, a figure that\nfalls to 28% for baby boomers.\n\nPiracy habits are relatively stable. Most people who admitted pirating\nsomething over the past twelve months indicate that they \u2018consume\u2019 about the\nsame as they did earlier. The positive news for rightsholders is that 35%\npirate less than before, while just 11% have increased their piracy volume.\n\n## Streaming Costs Trigger Piracy\n\nFor many people, fragmentation and cost of paid streaming services appear to\nbe key reasons for turning to pirate alternatives. More than a third of the\nself-proclaimed pirates mentioned the price of legal subscriptions among their\nreasons.\n\nOf all pirating respondents, 36% said they used unauthorized alternatives\nbecause they were only interested in a specific show or movie, which alone was\nnot worth a full subscription. This is close to the 35% who indicated that\nsubscription services are too expensive.\n\nThe results of these types of surveys should always be interpreted with\ncaution. The formulation of questions can be leading at times, for example,\nand paid online polls may have a selection bias.\n\nThe results make it clear that the price of legal subscriptions is an issue\nfor a number of people. At the same time, however, the majority of respondents\ndidn\u2019t mention cost as a problem. Other popular reasons to pirate include\ncontent being unavailable through legal channels, or to avoid advertising.\n\n## How to Solve It?\n\nThe current streaming landscape is complicated for a reason. Many players are\ntrying to gain market share hoping to become a dominant force. However, at\nsome point more consolidation would make sense to keep costs under control for\ndistributors and consumers.\n\nWhen asked about possible solutions, many respondents mentioned that cheaper\nlegal services would help, as would stronger penalties for online pirates.\n\nAt the moment, rightsholders are mostly focused on enforcement efforts to\ntackle the problem. In addition to going after pirate sites and services, they\nhope to introduce site blocking legislation to the United States. That has the\npotential to deter some casual pirates.\n\nAccording to the survey, an emphasis on the potential negative effects of\npiracy could help. Among the U.S. respondents who indicated that they had\nnever pirated anything, malware threats and potential negative effects on the\nindustry were frequently mentioned as reasons.\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * streaming\n  * survey\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nResearch\n\n### Movie & TV Giants Say French Pirate Site Audiences Are Continuously\nShrinking\n\n  * March 9, 2024, 10:04 by Andy Maxwell\n\n### Could Piracy Help Netflix Win the Streaming Wars?\n\n  * January 8, 2024, 12:19 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nResearch\n\n### EUIPO Study: 60% of Pirates Also Buy Content From Legal Sources\n\n  * June 13, 2023, 10:59 by Andy Maxwell\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nIconic Game Cracking Group CODEX Shuts Down\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nIconic Game Cracking Group CODEX Shuts Down\n\nMasked Cheat Maker Who \u201cAppeared on BBC\u201d Gets Sued By Ubisoft\n\nUS Copyright Law Doesn\u2019t Apply Worldwide,\u201dDVD Ripper\u201d Tells Court\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14965\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": true}
