Sign up\nfor it here.\n\nOn June 4, 1989, the Polish Communist Party held partially free elections,\nsetting in motion a series of events that ultimately removed the Communists\nfrom power. Not long afterward, street protests calling for free speech, due\nprocess, accountability, and democracy brought about the end of the Communist\nregimes in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Within a few years, the\nSoviet Union itself would no longer exist.\n\nAlso on June 4, 1989, the Chinese Communist Party ordered the military to\nremove thousands of students from Tiananmen Square. The students were calling\nfor free speech, due process, accountability, and democracy. Soldiers arrested\nand killed demonstrators in Beijing and around the country. Later, they\nsystematically tracked down the leaders of the protest movement and forced\nthem to confess and recant. Some spent years in jail. Others managed to elude\ntheir pursuers and flee the country forever.\n\n## Explore the June 2024 Issue\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nView More\n\nIn the aftermath of these events, the Chinese concluded that the physical\nelimination of dissenters was insufficient. To prevent the democratic wave\nthen sweeping across Central Europe from reaching East Asia, the Chinese\nCommunist Party eventually set out to eliminate not just the people but the\nideas that had motivated the protests. In the years to come, this would\nrequire policing what the Chinese people could see online.\n\nNobody believed that this would work. In 2000, President Bill Clinton told an\naudience at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies that it\nwas impossible. \u201cIn the knowledge economy,\u201d he said, \u201ceconomic innovation and\npolitical empowerment, whether anyone likes it or not, will inevitably go hand\nin hand.\u201d The transcript records the audience reactions:\n\n> \u201cNow, there\u2019s no question China has been trying to crack down on the\n> internet.\u201d (Chuckles.) \u201cGood luck!\u201d (Laughter.) \u201cThat\u2019s sort of like trying\n> to nail Jell-O to the wall.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\nWhile we were still rhapsodizing about the many ways in which the internet\ncould spread democracy, the Chinese were designing what\u2019s become known as the\nGreat Firewall of China. That method of internet management\u2014which is in effect\nconversation management\u2014contains many different elements, beginning with an\nelaborate system of blocks and filters that prevent internet users from seeing\nparticular words and phrases. Among them, famously, are Tiananmen, 1989, and\nJune 4, but there are many more. In 2000, a directive called \u201cMeasures for\nManaging Internet Information Services\u201d prohibited an extraordinarily wide\nrange of content, including anything that \u201cendangers national security,\ndivulges state secrets, subverts the government, undermines national\nunification,\u201d and \u201cis detrimental to the honor and interests of the\nstate\u201d\u2014anything, in other words, that the authorities didn\u2019t like.\n\nFrom the May 2022 issue: There is no liberal world order\n\nThe Chinese regime also combined online tracking methods with other tools of\nrepression, including security cameras, police inspections, and arrests. In\nXinjiang province, where China\u2019s Uyghur Muslim population is concentrated, the\nstate has forced people to install \u201cnanny apps\u201d that can scan phones for\nforbidden phrases and pick up unusual behavior: Anyone who downloads a virtual\nprivate network, anyone who stays offline altogether, and anyone whose home\nuses too much electricity (which could be evidence of a secret houseguest) can\narouse suspicion. Voice-recognition technology and even DNA swabs are used to\nmonitor where Uyghurs walk, drive, and shop. With every new breakthrough, with\nevery AI advance, China has gotten closer to its holy grail: a system that can\neliminate not just the words democracy and Tiananmen from the internet, but\nthe thinking that leads people to become democracy activists or attend public\nprotests in real life.\n\nIf people are naturally drawn to human rights, democracy, and freedom, then\nthose concepts have to be poisoned.\n\nBut along the way, the Chinese regime discovered a deeper problem:\nSurveillance, regardless of sophistication, provides no guarantees. During the\ncoronavirus pandemic, the Chinese government imposed controls more severe than\nmost of its citizens had ever experienced. Millions of people were locked into\ntheir homes. Untold numbers entered government quarantine camps. Yet the\nlockdown also produced the angriest and most energetic Chinese protests in\nmany years. Young people who had never attended a demonstration and had no\nmemory of Tiananmen gathered in the streets of Beijing and Shanghai in the\nautumn of 2022 to talk about freedom. In Xinjiang, where lockdowns were the\nlongest and harshest, and where repression is most complete, people came out\nin public and sang the Chinese national anthem, emphasizing one line: \u201cRise\nup, those who refuse to be slaves!\u201d Clips of their performance circulated\nwidely, presumably because the spyware and filters didn\u2019t identify the\nnational anthem as dissent.\n\nEven in a state where surveillance is almost total, the experience of tyranny\nand injustice can radicalize people. Anger at arbitrary power will always lead\nsomeone to start thinking about another system, a better way to run society.\nThe strength of these demonstrations, and the broader anger they reflected,\nwas enough to spook the Chinese Communist Party into lifting the quarantine\nand allowing the virus to spread. The deaths that resulted were preferable to\npublic anger and protest.\n\nLike the demonstrations against President Vladimir Putin in Russia that began\nin 2011, the 2014 street protests in Venezuela, and the 2019 Hong Kong\nprotests, the 2022 protests in China help explain something else: why\nautocratic regimes have slowly turned their repressive mechanisms outward,\ninto the democratic world. If people are naturally drawn to the image of human\nrights, to the language of democracy, to the dream of freedom, then those\nconcepts have to be poisoned. That requires more than surveillance, more than\nclose observation of the population, more than a political system that defends\nagainst liberal ideas. It also requires an offensive plan: a narrative that\ndamages both the idea of democracy everywhere in the world and the tools to\ndeliver it.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, as Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, fantastical\ntales of biological warfare began surging across the internet. Russian\nofficials solemnly declared that secret U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine had\nbeen conducting experiments with bat viruses and claimed that U.S. officials\nhad confessed to manipulating \u201cdangerous pathogens.\u201d The story was unfounded,\nnot to say ridiculous, and was repeatedly debunked.\n\nNevertheless, an American Twitter account with links to the QAnon conspiracy\nnetwork\u2014@WarClandestine\u2014began tweeting about the nonexistent biolabs, racking\nup thousands of retweets and views. The hashtag #biolab started trending on\nTwitter and reached more than 9 million views. Even after the account\u2014later\nrevealed to belong to a veteran of the Army National Guard\u2014was suspended,\npeople continued to post screenshots. A version of the story appeared on the\nInfowars website created by Alex Jones, best known for promoting conspiracy\ntheories about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and harassing\nfamilies of the victims. Tucker Carlson, then still hosting a show on Fox\nNews, played clips of a Russian general and a Chinese spokesperson repeating\nthe biolab fantasy and demanded that the Biden administration \u201cstop lying and\n[tell] us what\u2019s going on here.\u201d\n\nChinese state media also leaned hard into the story. A foreign-ministry\nspokesperson declared that the U.S. controlled 26 biolabs in Ukraine: \u201cRussia\nhas found during its military operations that the U.S. uses these facilities\nto conduct bio-military plans.\u201d Xinhua, a Chinese state news agency, ran\nmultiple headlines: \u201cU.S.-Led Biolabs Pose Potential Threats to People of\nUkraine and Beyond,\u201d \u201cRussia Urges U.S. to Explain Purpose of Biological Labs\nin Ukraine,\u201d and so on. U.S. diplomats publicly refuted these fabrications.\nNevertheless, the Chinese continued to spread them. So did the scores of\nAsian, African, and Latin American media outlets that have content-sharing\nagreements with Chinese state media. So did Telesur, the Venezuelan network;\nPress TV, the Iranian network; and Russia Today, in Spanish and Arabic, as\nwell as on many Russia Today\u2013linked websites around the world.\n\nThis joint propaganda effort worked. Globally, it helped undermine the\nU.S.-led effort to create solidarity with Ukraine and enforce sanctions\nagainst Russia. Inside the U.S., it helped undermine the Biden\nadministration\u2019s effort to consolidate American public opinion in support of\nproviding aid to Ukraine. According to one poll, a quarter of Americans\nbelieved the biolabs conspiracy theory to be true. After the invasion, Russia\nand China\u2014with, again, help from Venezuela, Iran, and far-right Europeans and\nAmericans\u2014successfully created an international echo chamber. Anyone inside\nthis echo chamber heard the biolab conspiracy theory many times, from\ndifferent sources, each one repeating and building on the others to create the\nimpression of veracity. They also heard false descriptions of Ukrainians as\nNazis, along with claims that Ukraine is a puppet state run by the CIA, and\nthat NATO started the war.\n\nOutside this echo chamber, few even know it exists. At a dinner in Munich in\nFebruary 2023, I found myself seated across from a European diplomat who had\njust returned from Africa. He had met with some students there and had been\nshocked to discover how little they knew about the war in Ukraine, and how\nmuch of what they did know was wrong. They had repeated the Russian claims\nthat the Ukrainians are Nazis, blamed NATO for the invasion, and generally\nused the same kind of language that can be heard every night on the Russian\nevening news. The diplomat was mystified. He grasped for explanations: Maybe\nthe legacy of colonialism explained the spread of these conspiracy theories,\nor Western neglect of the global South, or the long shadow of the Cold War.\n\nTyler Comrie\n\nBut the story of how Africans\u2014as well as Latin Americans, Asians, and indeed\nmany Europeans and Americans\u2014have come to spout Russian propaganda about\nUkraine is not primarily a story of European colonial history, Western policy,\nor the Cold War. Rather, it involves China\u2019s systematic efforts to buy or\ninfluence both popular and elite audiences around the world; carefully curated\nRussian propaganda campaigns, some open, some clandestine, some amplified by\nthe American and European far right; and other autocracies using their own\nnetworks to promote the same language.\n\nTo be fair to the European diplomat, the convergence of what had been\ndisparate authoritarian influence projects is still new. Russian information-\nlaundering and Chinese propaganda have long had different goals. Chinese\npropagandists mostly stayed out of the democratic world\u2019s politics, except to\npromote Chinese achievements, Chinese economic success, and Chinese narratives\nabout Tibet or Hong Kong. Their efforts in Africa and Latin America tended to\nfeature dull, unwatchable announcements of investments and state visits.\nRussian efforts were more aggressive\u2014sometimes in conjunction with the far\nright or the far left in the democratic world\u2014and aimed to distort debates and\nelections in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and\nelsewhere. Still, they often seemed unfocused, as if computer hackers were\nthrowing spaghetti at the wall, just to see which crazy story might stick.\nVenezuela and Iran were fringe players, not real sources of influence.\n\nSlowly, though, these autocracies have come together, not around particular\nstories, but around a set of ideas, or rather in opposition to a set of ideas.\nTransparency, for example. And rule of law. And democracy. They have heard\nlanguage about those ideas\u2014which originate in the democratic world\u2014coming from\ntheir own dissidents, and have concluded that they are dangerous to their\nregimes. Their own rhetoric makes this clear. In 2013, as Chinese President Xi\nJinping was beginning his rise to power, an internal Chinese memo, known\nenigmatically as Document No. 9\u2014or, more formally, as the Communiqu\u00e9 on the\nCurrent State of the Ideological Sphere\u2014listed \u201cseven perils\u201d faced by the\nChinese Communist Party. \u201cWestern constitutional democracy\u201d led the list,\nfollowed by \u201cuniversal human rights,\u201d \u201cmedia independence,\u201d \u201cjudicial\nindependence,\u201d and \u201ccivic participation.\u201d The document concluded that \u201cWestern\nforces hostile to China,\u201d together with dissidents inside the country, \u201care\nstill constantly infiltrating the ideological sphere,\u201d and instructed party\nleaders to push back against these ideas wherever they found them, especially\nonline, inside China and around the world.\n\nFrom the December 2021 issue: The bad guys are winning\n\nSince at least 2004, the Russians have been focused on the same convergence of\ninternal and external ideological threats. That was the year Ukrainians staged\na popular revolt, known as the Orange Revolution\u2014the name came from the orange\nT-shirts and flags of the protesters\u2014against a clumsy attempt to steal a\npresidential election. The angry intervention of the Ukrainian public into\nwhat was meant to have been a carefully orchestrated victory for Viktor\nYanukovych, a pro-Russian candidate directly supported by Putin himself,\nprofoundly unnerved the Russians. This was especially the case because a\nsimilarly unruly protest movement in Georgia had brought a pro-European\npolitician, Mikheil Saakashvili, to power the year before.\n\nShaken by those two events, Putin put the bogeyman of \u201ccolor revolution\u201d at\nthe center of Russian propaganda. Civic protest movements are now always\ndescribed as color revolutions in Russia, and as the work of outsiders.\nPopular opposition leaders are always said to be puppets of foreign\ngovernments. Anti-corruption and prodemocracy slogans are linked to chaos and\ninstability wherever they are used, whether in Tunisia, Syria, or the United\nStates. In 2011, a year of mass protest against a manipulated election in\nRussia itself, Putin bitterly described the Orange Revolution as a \u201cwell-\ntested scheme for destabilizing society,\u201d and he accused the Russian\nopposition of \u201ctransferring this practice to Russian soil,\u201d where he feared a\nsimilar popular uprising intended to remove him from power.\n\nPutin was wrong\u2014no \u201cscheme\u201d had been \u201ctransferred.\u201d Public discontent in\nRussia simply had no way to express itself except through street protest, and\nPutin\u2019s opponents had no legal means to remove him from power. Like so many\nother people around the world, they talked about democracy and human rights\nbecause they recognized that these concepts represented their best hope for\nachieving justice, and freedom from autocratic power. The protests that led to\ndemocratic transitions in the Philippines, Taiwan, South Africa, South Korea,\nand Mexico; the \u201cpeople\u2019s revolutions\u201d that washed across Central and Eastern\nEurope in 1989; the Arab Spring in 2011; and, yes, the color revolutions in\nUkraine and Georgia\u2014all were begun by those who had suffered injustice at the\nhands of the state, and who seized on the language of freedom and democracy to\npropose an alternative.\n\nThis is the core problem for autocracies: The Russians, the Chinese, the\nIranians, and others all know that the language of transparency,\naccountability, justice, and democracy appeals to some of their citizens, as\nit does to many people who live in dictatorships. Even the most sophisticated\nsurveillance can\u2019t wholly suppress it. The very ideas of democracy and freedom\nmust be discredited\u2014especially in the places where they have historically\nflourished.\n\nIn the 20th century, Communist Party propaganda was overwhelming and\ninspiring, or at least it was meant to be. The future it portrayed was shiny\nand idealized, a vision of clean factories, abundant produce, and healthy\ntractor drivers with large muscles and square jaws. The architecture was\ndesigned to overpower, the music to intimidate, the public spectacles to awe.\nIn theory, citizens were meant to feel enthusiasm, inspiration, and hope. In\npractice, this kind of propaganda backfired, because people could compare what\nthey saw on posters and in movies with a far more impoverished reality.\n\nA few autocracies still portray themselves to their citizens as model states.\nThe North Koreans continue to hold colossal military parades with elaborate\ngymnastics displays and huge portraits of their leader, very much in the\nStalinist style. But most modern authoritarians have learned from the mistakes\nof the previous century. Freedom House, a nonprofit that advocates for\ndemocracy around the world, lists 56 countries as \u201cnot free.\u201d Most don\u2019t offer\ntheir fellow citizens a vision of utopia, and don\u2019t inspire them to build a\nbetter world. Instead, they teach people to be cynical and passive, apathetic\nand afraid, because there is no better world to build. Their goal is to\npersuade their own people to stay out of politics, and above all to convince\nthem that there is no democratic alternative: Our state may be corrupt, but\neveryone else is corrupt too. You may not like our leader, but the others are\nworse. You may not like our society, but at least we are strong. The\ndemocratic world is weak, degenerate, divided, dying.\n\nInstead of portraying China as the perfect society, modern Chinese propaganda\nseeks to inculcate nationalist pride, based on China\u2019s real experience of\neconomic development, and to promote a Beijing model of progress through\ndictatorship and \u201corder\u201d that\u2019s superior to the chaos and violence of\ndemocracy. Chinese media mocked the laxity of the American response to the\npandemic with an animated film that ended with the Statue of Liberty on an\nintravenous drip. China\u2019s Global Times wrote that Chinese people were mocking\nthe January 6 insurrection as \u201ckarma\u201d and \u201cretribution\u201d: \u201cSeeing such\nscenarios,\u201d the publication\u2019s then-editor wrote in an op-ed, \u201cmany Chinese\nwill naturally recall that Nancy Pelosi once praised the violence of Hong Kong\nprotesters as \u2018a beautiful sight to behold.\u2019 \u201d (Pelosi, of course, had praised\npeaceful demonstrators, not violence.) The Chinese are told that these forces\nof chaos are out to disrupt their own lives, and they are encouraged to fight\nagainst them in a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d against foreign influence.\n\nRead: I watched Russian TV so you don\u2019t have to\n\nRussians, although they hear very little about what happens in their own towns\nand cities, receive similar messages about the decline of places they don\u2019t\nknow and have mostly never visited: America, France, Britain, Sweden,\nPoland\u2014countries apparently filled with degeneracy, hypocrisy, and\nRussophobia. A study of Russian television from 2014 to 2017 found that\nnegative news about Europe appeared on the three main Russian channels, all\nstate-controlled, an average of 18 times a day. Some of the stories were\nobviously invented (European governments are stealing children from straight\nfamilies and giving them to gay couples! ), but even the true ones were\ncherry-picked to support the idea that daily life in Europe is frightening and\nchaotic, that Europeans are weak and immoral, and that the European Union is\naggressive and interventionist. If anything, the portrayal of America has been\nmore dramatic. Putin himself has displayed a surprisingly intimate\nacquaintance with American culture wars about transgender rights, and\nmockingly sympathized with people who he says have been \u201ccanceled.\u201d\n\nFear, cynicism, nihilism, and apathy, coupled with disgust and disdain for\ndemocracy: This is what modern autocrats sell to their citizens and to\nforeigners, all with the aim of destroying what they call \u201cAmerican hegemony.\u201d\n\nThe goal is clear: to prevent Russians from identifying with Europe the way\nthey once did, and to build alliances between Putin\u2019s domestic audience and\nhis supporters in Europe and North America, where some naive conservatives (or\nperhaps cynical, well-paid conservatives) seek to convince their followers\nthat Russia is a \u201cwhite Christian state.\u201d In reality, Russia has very low\nchurch attendance, legal abortion, and a multiethnic population containing\nmillions of Muslim citizens and migrants. The autonomous region of Chechnya,\nwhich is part of the Russian Federation, is governed, in practice, by elements\nof Sharia law. The Russian state harasses and represses many forms of religion\noutside the state-sanctioned Russian Orthodox Church, including evangelical\nProtestantism. Nevertheless, among the slogans shouted by white nationalists\nmarching in the infamous Charlottesville, Virginia, demonstration in 2017 was\n\u201cRussia is our friend.\u201d Putin sends periodic messages to this constituency: \u201cI\nuphold the traditional approach that a woman is a woman, a man is a man, a\nmother is a mother, and a father is a father,\u201d he told a press conference in\nDecember 2021, almost as if this \u201ctraditional approach\u201d would be justification\nfor invading Ukraine.\n\nMichael Carpenter: Russia is co-opting angry young men\n\nThis manipulation of the strong emotions around gay rights and feminism has\nbeen widely copied throughout the autocratic world, often as a means of\ndefending against criticism of the regime. Yoweri Museveni, who has been the\npresident of Uganda for more than three decades, passed an \u201canti-\nhomosexuality\u201d bill in 2014, instituting a life sentence for gay people who\nhave sex or marry and criminalizing the \u201cpromotion\u201d of a homosexual lifestyle.\nBy picking a fight over gay rights, he was able to consolidate his supporters\nat home while neutralizing foreign criticisms of his regime, describing them\nas \u201csocial imperialism\u201d: \u201cOutsiders cannot dictate to us; this is our\ncountry,\u201d he declared. Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the prime minister of Hungary, also ducks\ndiscussion of Hungarian corruption by hiding behind a culture war. He pretends\nthat ongoing tension between his government and the U.S. ambassador to Hungary\nconcerns religion and gender: During Tucker Carlson\u2019s recent visit to Hungary,\nCarlson declared that the Biden administration \u201chates\u201d Hungary because \u201cit\u2019s a\nChristian country,\u201d when in fact it is Orb\u00e1n\u2019s deep financial and political\nties to Russia and China that have badly damaged American-Hungarian relations.\n\nThe new authoritarians also have a different attitude toward reality. When\nSoviet leaders lied, they tried to make their falsehoods seem real. They\nbecame angry when anyone accused them of lying. But in Putin\u2019s Russia, Bashar\nal-Assad\u2019s Syria, and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s Venezuela, politicians and television\npersonalities play a different game. They lie constantly, blatantly,\nobviously. But they don\u2019t bother to offer counterarguments when their lies are\nexposed. After Russian-controlled forces shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight\nMH17 over Ukraine in 2014, the Russian government reacted not only with a\ndenial, but with multiple stories, plausible and implausible: It blamed the\nUkrainian army, and the CIA, and a nefarious plot in which dead people were\nplaced on a plane in order to fake a crash and discredit Russia. This\ntactic\u2014the so-called fire hose of falsehoods\u2014ultimately produces not outrage\nbut nihilism. Given so many explanations, how can you know what actually\nhappened? What if you just can\u2019t know? If you don\u2019t know what happened, you\u2019re\nnot likely to join a great movement for democracy, or to listen when anyone\nspeaks about positive political change. Instead, you are not going to\nparticipate in any politics at all.\n\nAnne Applebaum: The American face of authoritarian propaganda\n\nFear, cynicism, nihilism, and apathy, coupled with disgust and disdain for\ndemocracy: This is the formula that modern autocrats, with some variations,\nsell to their citizens and to foreigners, all with the aim of destroying what\nthey call \u201cAmerican hegemony.\u201d In service of this idea, Russia, a colonial\npower, paints itself as a leader of the non-Western civilizations in what the\nanalyst Ivan Klyszcz calls their struggle for \u201cmessianic multipolarity,\u201d a\nbattle against \u201cthe West\u2019s imposition of \u2018decadent,\u2019 \u2018globalist\u2019 values.\u201d In\nSeptember 2022, when Putin held a ceremony to mark his illegal annexation of\nsouthern and eastern Ukraine, he claimed that he was protecting Russia from\nthe \u201csatanic\u201d West and \u201cperversions that lead to degradation and extinction.\u201d\nHe did not speak of the people he had tortured or the Ukrainian children he\nhad kidnapped. A year later, Putin told a gathering in Sochi: \u201cWe are now\nfighting not just for Russia\u2019s freedom but for the freedom of the whole world.\nWe can frankly say that the dictatorship of one hegemon is becoming decrepit.\nWe see it, and everyone sees it now. It is getting out of control and is\nsimply dangerous for others.\u201d The language of \u201chegemony\u201d and \u201cmultipolarity\u201d\nis now part of Chinese, Iranian, and Venezuelan narratives too.\n\nIn truth, Russia is a genuine danger to its neighbors, which is why most of\nthem are re-arming and preparing to fight against a new colonial occupation.\nThe irony is even greater in African countries like Mali, where Russian\nmercenaries from the Wagner Group have helped keep a military dictatorship in\npower, reportedly by conducting summary executions, committing atrocities\nagainst civilians, and looting property. In Mali, as in Ukraine, the battle\nagainst Western decadence means that white Russian thugs brutally terrorize\npeople with impunity.\n\nAnd yet Mali Actu, a pro-Russian website in Mali, solemnly explains to its\nreaders that \u201cin a world that is more and more multipolar, Africa will play a\nmore and more important role.\u201d Mali Actu is not alone; it\u2019s just a small part\nof a propaganda network, created by the autocracies, that is now visible all\nover the world.\n\nThe infrastructure of antidemocratic propaganda takes many forms, some overt\nand some covert, some aimed at the public and some aimed at elites. The United\nFront, the fulcrum of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s most important influence\nstrategy, seeks to shape perceptions of China around the world by creating\neducational and exchange programs, controlling Chinese exile communities,\nbuilding Chinese chambers of commerce, and courting anyone willing to be a de\nfacto spokesperson for China. The Confucius Institutes are probably the best-\nknown elite Chinese influence project. Originally perceived as benign cultural\nbodies not unlike the Goethe-Institut, run by the German government, and the\nAlliance Fran\u00e7aise, they were welcomed by many universities because they\nprovided cheap or even free Chinese-language classes and professors. Over\ntime, the institutes aroused suspicion, policing Chinese students at American\nuniversities by restricting open discussions of Tibet and Taiwan, and in some\ncases altering the teaching of Chinese history and politics to suit Chinese\nnarratives. They have now been mostly disbanded in the United States. But they\nare flourishing in many other places, including Africa, where there are\nseveral dozen.\n\nThese subtler operations are augmented by China\u2019s enormous investment in\ninternational media. The Xinhua wire service, the China Global Television\nNetwork, China Radio International, and China Daily all receive significant\nstate financing, have social-media accounts in multiple languages and regions,\nand sell, share, or otherwise promote their content. These Chinese outlets\ncover the entire world, and provide feeds of slickly produced news and video\nsegments to their partners at low prices, sometimes for free, which makes them\nmore than competitive with reputable Western newswires, such as Reuters and\nthe Associated Press. Scores of news organizations in Europe and Asia use\nChinese content, as do many in Africa, from Kenya and Nigeria to Egypt and\nZambia. Chinese media maintain a regional hub in Nairobi, where they hire\nprominent local journalists and produce content in African languages. Building\nthis media empire has been estimated to cost billions of dollars a year.\n\nTyler Comrie\n\nFor the moment, viewership of many of these Chinese-owned channels remains\nlow; their output can be predictable, even boring. But more popular forms of\nChinese television are gradually becoming available. StarTimes, a satellite-\ntelevision company that is tightly linked to the Chinese government, launched\nin Africa in 2008 and now has 13 million television subscribers in more than\n30 African countries. StarTimes is cheap for consumers, costing just a few\ndollars a month. It prioritizes Chinese content\u2014not just news but kung-fu\nmovies, soap operas, and Chinese Super League football, with the dialogue and\ncommentary all translated into Hausa, Swahili, and other African languages. In\nthis way, even entertainment can carry China-positive messages.\n\nThis subtler shift is the real goal: to have the Chinese point of view appear\nin the local press, with local bylines. Chinese propagandists call this\nstrategy \u201cborrowing boats to reach the sea,\u201d and it can be achieved in many\nways. Unlike Western governments, China doesn\u2019t think of propaganda,\ncensorship, diplomacy, and media as separate activities. Legal pressure on\nnews organizations, online trolling operations aimed at journalists,\ncyberattacks\u2014all of these can be deployed as part of a single operation\ndesigned to promulgate or undermine a given narrative. China also offers\ntraining courses or stipends for local journalists across Asia, Africa, and\nLatin America, sometimes providing phones and laptops in exchange for what the\nregime hopes will be favorable coverage.\n\nThe Chinese also cooperate, both openly and discreetly, with the media outlets\nof other autocracies. Telesur, a Hugo Ch\u00e1vez project launched in 2005, is\nheadquartered in Caracas and led by Venezuela in partnership with Cuba and\nNicaragua. Selectively culled bits of foreign news make it onto Telesur from\nits partners, including headlines that presumably have limited appeal in Latin\nAmerica: \u201cUS-Armenia Joint Military Drills Undermine Regional Stability,\u201d for\nexample, and \u201cRussia Has No Expansionist Plans in Europe.\u201d Both of these\nstories, from 2023, were lifted directly from the Xinhua wire.\n\nIran, for its part, offers HispanTV, the Spanish-language version of Press TV,\nthe Iranian international service. HispanTV leans heavily into open anti-\nSemitism and Holocaust denial: One March 2020 headline declared that the \u201cNew\nCoronavirus Is the Result of a Zionist Plot.\u201d Spain banned HispanTV and Google\nblocked it from its YouTube and Gmail accounts, but the service is easily\navailable across Latin America, just as Al-Alam, the Arabic version of Press\nTV, is widely available in the Middle East. After the October 7 Hamas attack\non Israel, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an international group\ndedicated to fighting disinformation, found that Iran was creating additional\nhacking groups to target digital, physical, and electoral infrastructure in\nIsrael (where it went after electoral rolls) and the United States. In the\nfuture, these hacking operations may be combined with propaganda campaigns.\n\nRT\u2014Russia Today\u2014has a bigger profile than either Telesur or Press TV; in\nAfrica, it has close links to China. Following the invasion of Ukraine, some\nsatellite networks dropped RT. But China\u2019s StarTimes satellite picked it up,\nand RT immediately began building offices and relationships across Africa,\nespecially in countries run by autocrats who echo its anti-Western, anti-LGBTQ\nmessages, and who appreciate its lack of critical or investigative reporting.\n\nRT\u2014like Press TV, Telesur, and even CGTN\u2014also functions as a production\nfacility, a source of video clips that can be spread online, repurposed and\nreused in targeted campaigns. Americans got a firsthand view of how the\nclandestine versions work in 2016, when the Internet Research Agency\u2014now\ndisbanded but based then in St. Petersburg and led by the late Yevgeny\nPrigozhin, more famous as the mercenary boss of the Wagner Group who staged an\naborted march on Moscow\u2014pumped out fake material via fake Facebook and Twitter\naccounts, designed to confuse American voters. Examples ranged from virulently\nanti-immigration accounts aimed at benefiting Donald Trump to fake Black Lives\nMatter accounts that attacked Hillary Clinton from the left.\n\nSince 2016, these tactics have been applied across the globe. The Xinhua and\nRT offices in Africa and around the world\u2014along with Telesur and\nHispanTV\u2014create stories, slogans, memes, and narratives promoting the\nworldview of the autocracies; these, in turn, are repeated and amplified in\nmany countries, translated into many languages, and reshaped for many local\nmarkets. The material produced is mostly unsophisticated, but it is\ninexpensive and can change quickly, according to the needs of the moment.\nAfter the October 7 Hamas attack, for example, official and unofficial Russian\nsources immediately began putting out both anti-Israel and anti-Semitic\nmaterial, and messages calling American and Western support for Ukraine\nhypocritical in light of the Gaza conflict. The data-analytics company Alto\nIntelligence found posts smearing both Ukrainians and Israelis as \u201cNazis,\u201d\npart of what appears to be a campaign to bring far-left and far-right\ncommunities closer together in opposition to U.S.-allied democracies. Anti-\nSemitic and pro-Hamas messages also increased inside China, as well as on\nChinese-linked accounts around the world. Joshua Eisenman, a professor at\nNotre Dame and the author of a new book on China\u2019s relations with Africa, told\nme that during a recent trip to Beijing, he was astonished by how quickly the\nprevious Chinese line on the Middle East\u2014\u201cChina-Israel relations are stronger\nthan ever\u201d\u2014changed. \u201cIt was a complete 180 in just a few days.\u201d\n\nNot that everyone hearing these messages will necessarily know where they come\nfrom, because they often appear in forums that conceal their origins. Most\npeople probably did not hear the American-biolabs conspiracy theory on a\ntelevision news program, for example. Instead, they heard it thanks to\norganizations like Pressenza and Yala News. Pressenza, a website founded in\nMilan and relocated to Ecuador in 2014, publishes in eight languages,\ndescribes itself as \u201can international news agency dedicated to news about\npeace and nonviolence,\u201d and featured an article on biolabs in Ukraine.\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, Pressenza is part of a project, run by\nthree Russian companies, that planned to create articles in Moscow and then\ntranslate them for these \u201cnative\u201d sites, following Chinese practice, to make\nthem seem \u201clocal.\u201d Pressenza denied the allegations; one of its journalists,\nOleg Yasinsky, who says he is of Ukrainian origin, responded by denouncing\nAmerica\u2019s \u201cplanetary propaganda machine\u201d and quoting Che Guevara.\n\nLike Pressenza, Yala News also markets itself as independent. This\nU.K.-registered, Arabic-language news operation provides slickly produced\nvideos, including celebrity interviews, to its 3 million followers every day.\nIn March 2022, as the biolabs allegation was being promoted by other outlets,\nthe site posted a video that echoed one of the most sensational versions:\nUkraine was planning to use migratory birds as a delivery vehicle for\nbioweapons, infecting the birds and then sending them into Russia to spread\ndisease.\n\nYala did not invent this ludicrous tale: Russian state media, such as the\nSputnik news agency, published it in Russian first, followed by Sputnik\u2019s\nArabic website and RT Arabic. Russia\u2019s United Nations ambassador addressed the\nUN Security Council about the biobird scandal, warning of the \u201creal biological\ndanger to the people in European countries, which can result from an\nuncontrolled spread of bioagents from Ukraine.\u201d In an April 2022 interview in\nKyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told The Atlantic\u2019s editor in\nchief, Jeffrey Goldberg, and me that the biobirds story reminded him of a\nMonty Python sketch. If Yala were truly an \u201cindependent\u201d publication, as it\ndescribes itself, it would have fact-checked this story, which, like the other\nbiolab conspiracies, was widely debunked.\n\nRead: Anne Applebaum and Jeffrey Goldberg interview Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nBut Yala News is not a news organization at all. As the BBC has reported, it\u2019s\nan information laundromat, a site that exists to spread and propagate material\nproduced by RT and other Russian facilities. Yala News has posted claims that\nthe Russian massacre of Ukrainian civilians at Bucha was staged, that Zelensky\nappeared drunk on television, and that Ukrainian soldiers were running away\nfrom the front lines. Although the company is registered to an address in\nLondon\u2014a mail drop shared by 65,000 other companies\u2014its \u201cnews team\u201d is based\nin a suburb of Damascus. The company\u2019s CEO is a Syrian businessman based in\nDubai who, when asked by the BBC, insisted on the organization\u2019s\n\u201cimpartiality.\u201d\n\nAnother strange actor in this field is RRN\u2014the company\u2019s name is an acronym,\noriginally for Reliable Russian News, later changed to Reliable Recent News.\nCreated in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, RRN, part of a\nbigger information-laundering operation known to investigators as\nDoppelganger, is primarily a \u201ctyposquatter\u201d: a company that registers domain\nnames that look similar to real media domain names\u2014Reuters.cfd instead of\nReuters.com, for example\u2014as well as websites with names that sound authentic\n(like Notre Pays, or \u201cOur Country\u201d) but are created to deceive. RRN is\nprolific. During its short existence, it has created more than 300 sites\ntargeting Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Links to these sites are\nthen used to make Facebook, Twitter, and other social-media posts appear\ncredible. When someone is quickly scrolling, they might not notice that a\nheadline links to a fake Spiegel.pro website, say, rather than to the\nauthentic German-magazine website Spiegel.de.\n\nDoppelganger\u2019s efforts, run by a clutch of companies in Russia, have varied\nwidely, and seem to have included fake NATO press releases, with the same\nfonts and design as the genuine releases, \u201crevealing\u201d that NATO leaders were\nplanning to deploy Ukrainian paramilitary troops to France to quell pension\nprotests. In November, operatives who the French government believes are\nlinked to Doppelganger spray-painted Stars of David around Paris and posted\nthem on social media, hoping to amplify French divisions over the Gaza war.\nRussian operatives built a social-media network to spread the false stories\nand the photographs of anti-Semitic graffiti. The goal is to make sure that\nthe people encountering this content have little clue as to who created it, or\nwhere or why.\n\nRussia and China are not the only parties in this space. Both real and\nautomated social-media accounts geolocated to Venezuela played a small role in\nthe 2018 Mexican presidential election, for example, boosting the campaign of\nAndr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Notable were two kinds of messages: those that\npromoted images of Mexican violence and chaos\u2014images that might make people\nfeel they need an autocrat to restore order\u2014and those that were angrily\nopposed to NAFTA and the U.S. more broadly. This tiny social-media investment\nmust have been deemed successful. After he became president, L\u00f3pez Obrador\nengaged in the same kinds of smear campaigns as unelected politicians in\nautocracies, empowered and corrupted the military, undermined the independence\nof the judiciary, and otherwise degraded Mexican democracy. In office, he has\npromoted Russian narratives about the war in Ukraine along with Chinese\nnarratives about the repression of the Uyghurs. Mexico\u2019s relationship with the\nUnited States has become more difficult\u2014and that, surely, was part of the\npoint.\n\nNone of these efforts would succeed without local actors who share the\nautocratic world\u2019s goals. Russia, China, and Venezuela did not invent anti-\nAmericanism in Mexico. They did not invent Catalan separatism, to name another\nmovement that both Russian and Venezuelan social-media accounts supported, or\nthe German far right, or France\u2019s Marine Le Pen. All they do is amplify\nexisting people and movements\u2014whether anti-LGBTQ, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim,\nanti-immigrant, anti-Ukrainian, or, above all, antidemocratic. Sometimes they\nprovide a social-media echo. Sometimes they employ reporters and spokespeople.\nSometimes they use the media networks they built for this purpose. And\nsometimes, they just rely on Americans to do it for them.\n\nHere is a difficult truth: A part of the American political spectrum is not\nmerely a passive recipient of the combined authoritarian narratives that come\nfrom Russia, China, and their ilk, but an active participant in creating and\nspreading them. Like the leaders of those countries, the American MAGA right\nalso wants Americans to believe that their democracy is degenerate, their\nelections illegitimate, their civilization dying. The MAGA movement\u2019s leaders\nalso have an interest in pumping nihilism and cynicism into the brains of\ntheir fellow citizens, and in convincing them that nothing they see is true.\nTheir goals are so similar that it is hard to distinguish between the online\nAmerican alt-right and its foreign amplifiers, who have multiplied since the\ndays when this was solely a Russian project. Tucker Carlson has even promoted\nthe fear of a color revolution in America, lifting the phrase directly from\nRussian propaganda. The Chinese have joined in too: Earlier this year, a group\nof Chinese accounts that had previously been posting pro-Chinese material in\nMandarin began posting in English, using MAGA symbols and attacking President\nJoe Biden. They showed fake images of Biden in prison garb, made fun of his\nage, and called him a satanist pedophile. One Chinese-linked account reposted\nan RT video repeating the lie that Biden had sent a neo-Nazi criminal to fight\nin Ukraine. Alex Jones\u2019s reposting of the lie on social media reached some\n400,000 people.\n\nGiven that both Russian and Chinese actors now blend in so easily with the\nMAGA messaging operation, it is hardly surprising that the American government\nhas difficulty responding to the newly interlinked autocratic propaganda\nnetwork. American-government-backed foreign broadcasters\u2014Voice of America,\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Farda, Radio Mart\u00ed\u2014still exist, but\nneither their mandate nor their funding has changed much in recent years. The\nintelligence agencies continue to observe what happens\u2014there is a Foreign\nMalign Influence Center under the Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence\u2014but they are by definition not part of the public debate. The\nonly relatively new government institution fighting antidemocratic propaganda\nis the Global Engagement Center, but it is in the State Department, and its\nmandate is to focus on authoritarian propaganda outside the United States.\nEstablished in 2016, it replaced the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism\nCommunications, which sought to foil the Islamic State and other jihadist\ngroups that were recruiting young people online. In 2014\u201315, as the scale of\nRussian disinformation campaigns in Europe were becoming better known,\nCongress designated the GEC to deal with Russian as well as Chinese, Iranian,\nand other propaganda campaigns around the world\u2014although not, again, inside\nthe United States. Throughout the Trump administration, the organization\nlanguished under the direction of a president who himself repeated Russian\npropaganda lines during the 2016 campaign\u2014\u201cObama founded ISIS,\u201d for example,\nand \u201cHillary will start World War III.\u201d\n\nToday the GEC is run by James Rubin, a former State Department spokesperson\nfrom the Bill Clinton era. It employs 125 people and has a budget of $61\nmillion\u2014hardly a match for the many billions that China and Russia spend\nbuilding their media networks. But it is beginning to find its footing,\nhanding out small grants to international groups that track and reveal foreign\ndisinformation operations. It\u2019s now specializing in identifying covert\npropaganda campaigns before they begin, with the help of U.S. intelligence\nagencies. Rubin calls this \u201cprebunking\u201d and describes it as a kind of\n\u201cinoculation\u201d: \u201cIf journalists and governments know that this is coming, then\nwhen it comes, they will recognize it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLo and behold, the entity that becomes the most persistent in alleging that\nAmerican elections are fraudulent, fake, rigged, and everything else turns out\nto be the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe revelation in November of the Russian ties to seemingly native left-wing\nwebsites in Latin America, including Pressenza, was one such effort. More\nrecently, the GEC published a report on the African Initiative, an agency that\nhad planned a huge campaign to discredit Western health philanthropy, starting\nwith rumors about a new virus supposedly spread by mosquitoes. The idea was to\nsmear Western doctors, clinics, and philanthropists, and to build a climate of\ndistrust around Western medicine, much as Russian efforts helped build a\nclimate of distrust around Western vaccines during the pandemic. The GEC\nidentified the Russian leader of the project, Artem Sergeyevich Kureyev; noted\nthat several employees had come to the African Initiative from the Wagner\nGroup; and located two of its offices, in Mali and Burkina Faso. Rubin and\nothers subsequently spent a lot of time talking with regional reporters about\nthe African Initiative\u2019s plans so that \u201cpeople will recognize them\u201d when they\nlaunch. Dozens of articles in English, Spanish, and other languages have\ndescribed these operations, as have thousands of social-media posts.\nEventually, the goal is to create an alliance of other nations who also want\nto share information about planned and ongoing information operations so that\neveryone knows they are coming.\n\nIt\u2019s a great idea, but no equivalent agency functions inside the United\nStates. Some social-media companies have made purely voluntary efforts to\nremove foreign-government propaganda, sometimes after being tipped off by the\nU.S. government but mostly on their own. In the U.S., Facebook created a\nsecurity-policy unit that still regularly announces when it discovers\n\u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior\u201d\u2014meaning accounts that are automated and/or\nevidently part of a planned operation from (usually) Russian, Iranian, or\nChinese sources\u2014and then takes down the posts. It is difficult for outsiders\nto monitor this activity, because the company restricts access to its data,\nand even controls the tools that can be used to examine the data. In March,\nMeta announced that by August, it would phase out CrowdTangle, a tool used to\nanalyze Facebook data, and replace it with a tool that analysts fear will be\nharder to use.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) also used to look for foreign propaganda activity, but\nunder the ownership of Elon Musk, that voluntary effort has been badly\nweakened. The new blue-check \u201cverification\u201d process allows users\u2014including\nanonymous, pro-Russian users\u2014to pay to have their posts amplified; the old\n\u201csafety team\u201d no longer exists. The result: After the collapse of the Kakhovka\ndam in Ukraine last summer, a major environmental and humanitarian disaster\ncaused by Russian bombing over many weeks, the false narrative that Ukraine\nhad destroyed it appeared hundreds of thousands of times on X. After the ISIS\nterrorist attack on a concert hall in Moscow in March, David Sacks, the former\nPayPal entrepreneur and a close associate of Musk\u2019s, posted on X, with no\nevidence, that \u201cif the Ukrainian government was behind the terrorist attack,\nas looks increasingly likely, the U.S. must renounce it.\u201d His completely\nunfounded post was viewed 2.5 million times. This spring, some Republican\ncongressional leaders finally began speaking about the Russian propaganda that\nhad \u201cinfected\u201d their base and their colleagues. Most of that \u201cRussian\npropaganda\u201d is not coming from inside Russia.\n\nOver the past several years, universities and think tanks have used their own\ndata analytics to try to identify inauthentic networks on the largest\nwebsites\u2014but they are also now meeting resistance from MAGA-affiliated\nRepublican politicians. In 2020, teams at Stanford University and the\nUniversity of Washington, together with the Digital Forensic Research Lab at\nthe Atlantic Council and Graphika, a company that specializes in social-media\nanalytics, decided to join forces to monitor false election information. Ren\u00e9e\nDiResta, one of the leaders of what became the Election Integrity Partnership,\ntold me that an early concern was Russian and Chinese campaigns. DiResta\nassumed that these foreign interventions wouldn\u2019t matter much, but she thought\nit would be useful and academically interesting to understand their scope. \u201cLo\nand behold,\u201d she said, \u201cthe entity that becomes the most persistent in\nalleging that American elections are fraudulent, fake, rigged, and everything\nelse turns out to be the president of the United States.\u201d The Election\nIntegrity Partnership tracked election rumors coming from across the political\nspectrum, but observed that the MAGA right was far more prolific and\nsignificant than any other source.\n\nThe Election Integrity Partnership was not organized or directed by the U.S.\ngovernment. It occasionally reached out to platforms, but had no power to\ncompel them to act, DiResta told me. Nevertheless, the project became the\nfocus of a complicated MAGA-world conspiracy theory about alleged government\nsuppression of free speech, and it led to legal and personal attacks on many\nof those involved. The project has been smeared and mischaracterized by some\nof the journalists attached to Musk\u2019s \u201cTwitter Files\u201d investigation, and by\nRepresentative Jim Jordan\u2019s Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the\nFederal Government. A series of lawsuits alleging that the U.S. government\nsought to suppress conservative speech, including one launched by Missouri and\nLouisiana that has now reached the Supreme Court, has effectively tried to\nsilence organizations that investigate both domestic and foreign\ndisinformation campaigns, overt and covert. To state baldly what is happening:\nThe Republican Party\u2019s right wing is actively harassing legitimate, good-faith\nefforts to track the production and dissemination of autocratic disinformation\nhere in the United States.\n\nOver time, the attack on the Election Integrity Partnership has itself\nacquired some of the characteristics of a classic information-laundering\noperation. The most notorious example concerns a reference, on page 183 of the\nproject\u2019s final post-2020-election report, to the 21,897,364 tweets gathered\nafter the election, in an effort to catalog the most viral false rumors. That\nsimple statement of the size of the database has been twisted into another\nfalse and yet constantly repeated rumor: the spurious claim that the\nDepartment of Homeland Security somehow conspired with the Election Integrity\nPartnership to censor 22 million tweets. This never happened, and yet DiResta\nsaid that \u201cthis nonsense about the 22 million tweets pops up constantly as\nevidence of the sheer volume of our duplicity\u201d; it has even appeared in the\nCongressional Record.\n\nThe same tactics have been used against the Global Engagement Center. In 2021,\nthe GEC gave a grant to another organization, the Global Disinformation Index,\nwhich helped develop a technical tool to track online campaigns in East Asia\nand Europe. For a completely unrelated, separately funded project, the Global\nDisinformation Index also conducted a study, aimed at advertisers, that\nidentified websites at risk for publishing false stories. Two conservative\norganizations, finding their names on that latter list, sued the GEC, although\nit had nothing to do with creating the list. Musk posted, again without any\nevidence, \u201cThe worst offender in US government censorship & media manipulation\nis an obscure agency called GEC,\u201d and that organization also became caught up\nin the endless whirlwind of conspiracy and congressional investigations.\n\nAs it happens, I was caught up in it too, because I was listed online as an\n\u201cadviser\u201d to the Global Disinformation Index, even though I had not spoken\nwith anyone at the organization for several years and was not aware that it\neven had a website. A predictable, and wearisome, pattern followed: false\naccusations (no, I was not advising anyone to censor anyone) and the\nobligatory death threats. Of course, my experience was mild compared with the\nexperience of DiResta, who has been accused of being, as she put it, \u201cthe head\nof a censorship-industrial complex that does not exist.\u201d\n\nThese stories are symptomatic of a larger problem: Because the American\nextreme right and (more rarely) the extreme left benefit from the spread of\nantidemocratic narratives, they have an interest in silencing or hobbling any\ngroup that wants to stop, or even identify, foreign campaigns. Senator Mark\nWarner, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told me that \u201cwe are\nactually less prepared today than we were four years ago\u201d for foreign attempts\nto influence the 2024 election. This is not only because authoritarian\npropaganda campaigns have become more sophisticated as they begin to use AI,\nor because \u201cyou obviously have a political environment here where there\u2019s a\nlot more Americans who are more distrustful of all institutions.\u201d It\u2019s also\nbecause the lawsuits, threats, and smear tactics have chilled government,\nacademic, and tech-company responses.\n\nOne could call this a secret authoritarian \u201cplot\u201d to preserve the ability to\nspread antidemocratic conspiracy theories, except that it\u2019s not a secret. It\u2019s\nall visible, right on the surface. Russia, China, and sometimes other state\nactors\u2014Venezuela, Iran, Hungary\u2014work with Americans to discredit democracy, to\nundermine the credibility of democratic leaders, to mock the rule of law. They\ndo so with the goal of electing Trump, whose second presidency would damage\nthe image of democracy around the world, as well as the stability of democracy\nin America, even further.\n\nThis article appears in the June 2024 print edition with the headline\n\u201cDemocracy Is Losing the Propaganda War.\u201d Anne Applebaum\u2019s new book,\nAutocracy, Inc.: The Dictators Who Want to Run the World, will be published in\nJuly.\n\nAutocracy, Inc.: The Dictators Who Want To Run The World\n\nBy Anne Applebaum\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
