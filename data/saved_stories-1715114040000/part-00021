When combined with\nfaster memory bandwidth, the new iPad Air is nearly 50% faster than the\nprevious iPad Air with M1 for a wide range of productivity and creative tasks,\naccording to Apple. And compared to iPad Air with A14 Bionic, the new M2 model\ndelivers up to 3x faster performance. Apple also claims that the 13-inch model\ndelivers better sound quality with double the bass than the previous\ngeneration.\n\nIn addition, the new iPad Air supports Wi-Fi 6E, which provides up to 2x\nincreased performance than the previous generation. It's also compatible with\nthe new Apple Pencil Pro, which features a new sensor in the barrel that can\nsense a user's squeeze, and brings up a tool palette to quickly switch tools,\nline weights, and colors, \"all without interrupting the creative process,\"\nclaims the company.\n\nApple is touting the new iPad Air as \"an incredibly powerful device for\nartificial intelligence.\" Unlike the previous generation, the 12MP Ultra Wide\nFaceTime camera on the devices is located along the longest edge so that it\ncaptures video from a more central, horizontal position during video calls.\nThe camera also features Center Stage, which uses machine learning to\nautomatically keep everyone in the field of view.\n\nThe new iPad Air is nearly 50% faster than the previous iPad Air with M1,\naccording to Apple. Compared to iPad Air with A14 Bionic, it provides 3x\nfaster performance. Apple says the new models are also compatible with the\nlatest Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard, with Apple Pencil Hover support\nfor greater precision.\n\nThe new iPad Air models feature an LCD Liquid Retina display, and both sizes\ncome in several colors including new blue, new purple, Starlight and Space\nGrey, and a new 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.\n\n> \"So many users \u2014 from students, to content creators, to small businesses,\n> and more \u2014 love iPad Air for its performance, portability, and versatility,\n> all at an affordable price. Today, iPad Air gets even better,\" said Bob\n> Borchers, Apple's vice president of Product Marketing. \"We're so excited to\n> introduce the redesigned 11-inch and all-new 13-inch iPad Air, offering two\n> sizes for the first time. With its combination of a brilliant Liquid Retina\n> display, the phenomenal performance of the M2 chip, incredible AI\n> capabilities, and its colorful, portable design with support for new\n> accessories, iPad Air is more powerful and versatile than ever.\"\n\nA new Smart Folio for iPad Air attaches magnetically and supports multiple\nviewing angles for greater flexibility. Available in charcoal gray, light\nviolet, denim, and sage, the new Smart Folio also complements the finishes of\nthe latest iPad Air.\n\nThe iPad Air is available starting with 128GB of storage, with more storage\noptions including 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. Like the previous models, the iPad\nAir starts at $599, while the 13-inch device starts at $799. They can be\nordered today, and shipping starts next week.\n\nRelated Roundup: iPad Air\n\nTag: May 2024 Apple Event\n\nBuyer's Guide: iPad Air (Buy Now)\n\nRelated Forum: iPad\n\n[ 69 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\ndustin_\n\n2 hours ago at 07:13 am\n\nHigher base storage!\n\nScore: 15 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nDDustiNN\n\n2 hours ago at 07:26 am\n\nM2, no Face ID, more ugly pastel colors...\n\nM1 blue works for me.\n\nScore: 10 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nissacj\n\n2 hours ago at 07:18 am\n\nDisappointed it's still Touch ID.

Nothing worth upgrading from a\n5th gen iPad Air obviously, but most people hang onto iPads for years so it\u2019s\na nice upgrade for anyone coming from an iPad that\u2019s a few years old.\n\nEdit: also a 13\u201d option without having to go for a more expensive iPad Pro\n\nScore: 6 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nApplesAreSweet&Sour\n\n1 hour ago at 07:57 am\n\n> Other than the chip what\u2019s exactly new here ?\n\n* 128GB in the baseline $599 configuration * Marginally larger display on the 11\" one? Like, 0,1\" or less. * A new 13\" option * Landscape-oriented front-facing camera * Wifi 6E (older one was Wifi 6) * Support for Apple Pencil Pro (maybe incompatible with 2nd Gen Pencil?) * Supports Magic Keyboard, like the older model. But doesn't support Smart Keyboard Folio(older one did) * M2 (like you said) * Two new finishes in purple and blue that replace the older ones. The new ones look brighter?\n\nI think that's it.\n\nIt's not a ton of upgrades.\n\nBut the 128GB at $599 makes M2 iPad Air a very good deal by comparison to the\nolder one.\n\nScore: 5 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nabatabia\n\n2 hours ago at 07:11 am\n\nMy M1 is just fine.
