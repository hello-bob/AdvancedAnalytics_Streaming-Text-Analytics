This article depicts the transformation of the\nchecklist into the physical instrument.\n\n#### German Tebiev\n\nApr 30, 2024 \u2014 3 min read\n\nIn the article \u201cHow to create a working checklist?\u201d it was mentioned that a\nchecklist is the first way to respect the complexity of life. If there is a\nfirst, then there is a subsequent one. Let's look at how to embed a checklist\ninto an item. We\u2019ll use a toolbox as an example.\n\nLet's assume that we have the following tools:\n\n  1. A hammer with a separate rubber casing.\n  2. Adjustable spanner.\n  3. Bits screwdriver with 12 bits.\n  4. Combination pliers.\n\nLet it also be present a shallow box where these tools are stacked. Just like\nthe one in the illustration.\n\nWe are fascinated by the work, and therefore it is convenient not to search\nfor the right tool every time, but to know exactly where it is. Therefore, we\nput the tools from left to right in the following order:\n\n  1. Pliers.\n  2. Screwdriver with bits.\n  3. Hammer with rubber casing.\n  4. Adjustable spanner.\n\nEverything seems fine, the order is set, but here's the problem. Other people\nsometimes take our box. They don't know how everything is arranged in it, and\nthey stack the tools haphazardly. But we are not afraid of difficulties. We'll\ntake a small piece of paper and write a tiny checklist on it.\n\n> From left to right: \u2022 Pliers \u2022 Screwdriver with bits \u2022 Hammer with rubber\n> casing \u2022 Adjustable spanner\n\nWe will stick the sheet on the transparent lid of the box with scotch tape.\nThis way it will immediately become clear what to do, where is left and where\nthere is right.\n\nLet's make a few more assumptions:\n\n  * The users of our box are polite and responsive people.\n  * Users can read.\n\nIn such pleasant conditions, peace and order will come to our box.\n\nOkay, they will almost come. Occasionally, we need to take the box somewhere,\nand everything in it gets mixed up. Plus, the lid is often open, and the\nchecklist is facing down, so new users of the open box do not return the\ndesired order. What should we do? We need to embed the checklist in the box.\n\nLook at this popular set of tools. Is there a high probability that the pliers\nwill be in place of the adjustable spanner? It is small, the very structure of\nthe box doesn\u2019t allow this switching to happen. You can put the screwdriver in\nplace of the hammer, but the whole set will still not compile after that.\n\nWhat else do we gain after such a transformation? Now it\u2019s no need to waste\ntime on training, and you don't even have to read the checklist! There was a\nhitch in reassessing the order: \u201cWouldn't it be better if I put everything\ndifferently?\u201d Now it\u2019s gone. This is also a small disadvantage \u2014 we have\ncomplicated the further rethinking of our box and its improvement. However,\nwho knows if it can be rethought in any significantly better way?\n\nThe mentioned acceleration of learning and removal of rethinking hitch may not\nlook serious yet. This is a result of our primitive example, but there are\nexamples that are much more complex. For example, in lean manufacturing, there\nis a method for dealing with defects \u201cPoka-yoke\u201d, which means \u201cerror\nprevention\u201d [1]. It is about the creation of the environment and tools in such\na way that the probability of defects is either excluded or seriously\nminimized. That is, people do not need to remember a long list of rules\nbecause it is already reflected in the way production is organized. In this\ncase, embedding the checklist in the environment scales to the entire\nproduction and serves as a mean of significant costs reduction.\n\nIn the next part of this blog post series, automation of the checklist will be\ndiscussed.\n\nList of links: [1] \u201cPoka-yoke\u201d from Wikipedia\n\n## Read more\n\n### About the great power of counting\n\nCounting is a very common and almost invisible phenomenon.
