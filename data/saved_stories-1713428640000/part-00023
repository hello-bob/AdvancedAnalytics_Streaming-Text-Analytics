X/@NoTechApartheid\n\n\u201cA small number of employee protesters entered and disrupted a few of our\nlocations. Physically impeding other employees\u2019 work and preventing them from\naccessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely\nunacceptable behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have so far concluded individual investigations that resulted in the\ntermination of employment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate\nand take action as needed,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nThe demonstrators stormed the personal office of Google Cloud CEO Thomas\nKurian in Sunnyvale.\n\nKurian\u2019s custom-made, framed Golden State Warriors jersey was visible on the\noffice wall in the background of the livestream, and employees wrote a list of\ntheir demands on his white board.\n\n6\n\nCritics at the company raised concerns that the technology would be weaponized\nagainst Palestinians in Gaza.

They took over office spaces, defaced our property,\nand physically impeded the work of other Googlers. Their behavior was\nunacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened. We\nplaced employees involved under investigation and cut their access to our\nsystems. Those who refused to leave were arrested by law enforcement and\nremoved from our offices.\n\nFollowing investigation, today we terminated the employment of twenty-eight\nemployees found to be involved. We will continue to investigate and take\naction as needed.\n\nBehavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not tolerate it.\nIt clearly violates multiple policies that all employees must adhere to \u2013\nincluding our Code of Conduct and Policy on Harassment, Discrimination,\nRetaliation, Standards of Conduct, and Workplace Concerns.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nWe are a place of business and every Googler is expected to read our policies\nand apply them to how they conduct themselves and communicate in our\nworkplace. The overwhelming majority of our employees do the right thing. If\nyou\u2019re one of the few who are tempted to think we\u2019re going to overlook conduct\nthat violates our policies, think again. The company takes this extremely\nseriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take\naction against disruptive behavior \u2013 up to and including termination.\n\nYou should expect to hear more from leaders about standards of behavior and\ndiscourse in the workplace.\n\nChris\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * google\n  * hamas\n  * israel\n  * Israel-Hamas war\n  * protests\n  * 4/17/24\n\nRead Next Majority of US couples do not have an estate plan, study f...\n\n## Columnists\n\n  * ### \n\nJennifer Gould\n\n#### NYC power lunch makes comeback as more workers return to office\n\n  * ### \n\nCharles Gasparino\n\n#### The \u2018short\u2019 story behind Donald Trump's Truth Social platform\n\n  * ### \n\nLydia Moynihan\n\n#### Ex-Clinton adviser Declan Kelly consulting on Boeing CEO search: 'Doesn't\nknow planes, but he knows disasters'\n\n### See All Columnists\n\n#### Trending Now in Business\n\n  * This story has been shared 32,541 times. 32,541\n\n### Google fires 28 employees involved in sit-in protest over $1.2B Israel\ncontract\n\n  * This story has been shared 14,312 times. 14,312\n\n### Google lays off workers as part of 'pretty large-scale' restructuring\n\n  * This story has been shared 13,121 times. 13,121\n\n### I'm a Millennial boss -- my Gen Z staff has wild work habits\n\n## Now on Page Six\n\n  * ### Kim Kardashian fans mock her for diving in \u2018knee-deep water\u2019 for new bikini photos: \u2018Are you okay?\u2019\n\n  * ### Valerie Bertinelli\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s identity revealed as he gushes over their \u2018good\u2019 relationship: \u2018I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re together\u2019\n\n  * ### Jeezy backtracks full custody request of 2-year-old daughter, Monaco, with Jeannie Mai\n\nSee All\n\n#### Video\n\n  * ### Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex Brandon Blackstock hits back at her new lawsuit after $2.6M ruling\n\nA large group of Google employees hold signs protesting their company's\nparticipation in \"Project Nimbus.\" X/@NoTechApartheid\n\nThe unruly staffers were terminated late Wednesday.
