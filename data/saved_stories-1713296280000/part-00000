This black hole was spotted in data from the European\nSpace Agency\u2019s Gaia mission because it imposes an odd \u2018wobbling\u2019 motion on the\ncompanion star orbiting it. Data from the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very\nLarge Telescope (ESO\u2019s VLT) and other ground-based observatories were used to\nverify the mass of the black hole, putting it at an impressive 33 times that\nof the Sun.\n\nStellar black holes are formed from the collapse of massive stars and the ones\npreviously identified in the Milky Way are on average about 10 times as\nmassive as the Sun. Even the next most massive stellar black hole known in our\ngalaxy, Cygnus X-1, only reaches 21 solar masses, making this new 33-solar-\nmass observation exceptional [1].\n\nRemarkably, this black hole is also extremely close to us \u2014 at a mere 2000\nlight-years away in the constellation Aquila, it is the second-closest known\nblack hole to Earth. Dubbed Gaia BH3 or BH3 for short, it was found while the\nteam were reviewing Gaia observations in preparation for an upcoming data\nrelease. \u201cNo one was expecting to find a high-mass black hole lurking nearby,\nundetected so far,\u201d says Gaia collaboration member Pasquale Panuzzo, an\nastronomer from the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) at the\nObservatoire de Paris - PSL, France. \"This is the kind of discovery you make\nonce in your research life.\"\n\nTo confirm their discovery, the Gaia collaboration used data from ground-based\nobservatories, including from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph\n(UVES) instrument on ESO\u2019s VLT, located in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert [2]. These\nobservations revealed key properties of the companion star, which, together\nwith Gaia data, allowed astronomers to precisely measure the mass of BH3.\n\nAstronomers have found similarly massive black holes outside our galaxy (using\na different detection method), and have theorised that they may form from the\ncollapse of stars with very few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in\ntheir chemical composition. These so-called metal-poor stars are thought to\nlose less mass over their lifetimes and hence have more material left over to\nproduce high-mass black holes after their death. But evidence directly linking\nmetal-poor stars to high-mass black holes has been lacking until now.\n\nStars in pairs tend to have similar compositions, meaning that BH3\u2019s companion\nholds important clues about the star that collapsed to form this exceptional\nblack hole. UVES data showed that the companion was a very metal-poor star,\nindicating that the star that collapsed to form BH3 was also metal-poor \u2014 just\nas predicted.\n\nThe research study, led by Panuzzo, is published today in Astronomy &\nAstrophysics. \u201cWe took the exceptional step of publishing this paper based on\npreliminary data ahead of the forthcoming Gaia release because of the unique\nnature of the discovery,\u201d says co-author Elisabetta Caffau, also a Gaia\ncollaboration member and CNRS scientist from the Observatoire de Paris - PSL.\nMaking the data available early will let other astronomers start studying this\nblack hole right now, without waiting for the full data release, planned for\nlate 2025 at the earliest.\n\nFurther observations of this system could reveal more about its history and\nabout the black hole itself. The GRAVITY instrument on ESO\u2019s VLT\nInterferometer, for example, could help astronomers find out whether this\nblack hole is pulling in matter from its surroundings and better understand\nthis exciting object.\n\n### Notes\n\n[1] This is not the most massive black hole in our galaxy \u2014 that title belongs\nto Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way\u2019s centre,\nwhich has about four million times the mass of the Sun. But Gaia BH3 is the\nmost massive black hole known in the Milky Way that formed from the collapse\nof a star.\n\n[2] Aside from UVES on ESO\u2019s VLT, the study relied on data from: the HERMES\nspectrograph at the Mercator Telescope operated at La Palma (Spain) by Leuven\nUniversity, Belgium, in collaboration with the Observatory of the University\nof Geneva, Switzerland; and the SOPHIE high-precision spectrograph at the\nObservatoire de Haute-Provence \u2013 OSU Institut Pyth\u00e9as.\n\n### More information\n\nThis research was presented in a paper entitled \u201cDiscovery of a dormant 33\nsolar-mass black hole in pre-release Gaia astrometry\u201d to appear in Astronomy &\nAstrophysics (https://aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202449763).\n\nThe paper, by P. Panuzzo et al., is authored by the Gaia collaboration, which\ninvolves over 300 authors from around the world, including Austria, Belgium,\nCzechia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Chile and Australia.\n\nThe European Southern Observatory (ESO) enables scientists worldwide to\ndiscover the secrets of the Universe for the benefit of all. We design, build\nand operate world-class observatories on the ground \u2014 which astronomers use to\ntackle exciting questions and spread the fascination of astronomy \u2014 and\npromote international collaboration for astronomy. Established as an\nintergovernmental organisation in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member\nStates (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland,\nItaly, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the\nUnited Kingdom), along with the host state of Chile and with Australia as a\nStrategic Partner. ESO\u2019s headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium,\nthe ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean\nAtacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions to observe the sky,\nhosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal\nand Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very\nLarge Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA.\nAlso at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South,\nthe world\u2019s largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with\ninternational partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that\nobserves the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro\nArmazones, near Paranal, we are building \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest eye on the sky\u201d\n\u2014 ESO\u2019s Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we\nsupport our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and\nsociety.\n\n### Links\n\n  * Research paper\n  * Photos of the VLT\n  * ESA news article on this research\n  * For journalists: subscribe to receive our releases under embargo in your language\n  * For scientists: got a story?
