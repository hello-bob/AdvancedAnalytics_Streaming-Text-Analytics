I could write a sappy love story\nabout Danielle and me, like this video I made after proposing to her. Instead,\nI want to focus on what we built for the wedding and how I opted to create as\nmuch as possible by ourselves, probably more than necessary.\n\nIt started early on. We got engaged in March of 2022, and within the following\nweeks, we had almost everything booked and planned. We managed to get one of\nthe last Saturdays of 2023 at the Ottawa Art Gallery, which was a rude\nawakening for me as I was blissfully unaware of the chaos of the wedding\nindustry. Shortly after everything was booked, it was time to get to work\ncreating the wedding of our dreams.\n\n## Branding\n\nThe first thing to figure out was the general aesthetic and branding for the\nwedding. It\u2019s a bit unnecessary, but this is my area of expertise, so I wanted\nto go all out. I started with a graphic device to act as a \u2018Logo\u2019 for the\nevent, chose typefaces for the typography, and defined a colour palette so\nthat all the materials felt consistent and cohesive.\n\nSince our wedding was in the fall, we opted to keep the palette in line with a\nwarm autumn tonal range. Leading with cream as the primary colour, some warm\nterracotta paired with a desaturated olive green was a nice way to keep it\nminimal and add a touch of colour.\n\nUsing four font families is a bit much for a brand like this, but there were\ndifferent needs for digital materials vs. small-scale print materials like the\nsave-the-date, RSVP invitation, and menu. Mainly though, I just couldn\u2019t make\nup my mind, so I chose all of them.\n\n## Stationary\n\nWith our venue, website domain, and vendors booked for the day, we needed to\nsend something out to our guests to let them know they\u2019d be invited and to\nkeep their calendars open. We started assembling the save-the-date mailer in\nlate Summer 2022 to mail them out for the 1-year mark in October.\n\nWe went to a paper shop and picked out a nice cardstock with a subtle texture\nand a slightly off-white colour. I kept the design simple, and to minimize the\namount of paper waste, I designed 4 to fit perfectly on standard letter-sized\npaper. I wanted to make them feel customized in a way, so I ordered a custom\nembosser of the logo, a rounded corner cutter, and a custom stamp for the\nmixed media effect for our names. I liked the structured type of our names and\nthe organic contrast that the hand-stamped \u2018McCarthy\u2019 gave with it.\n\nAfter the save-the-date, I moved on to planning the RSVP mailout. I knew I\nwanted to do something more intricate, like a half-moon cut on the top of the\nRSVP and an information card inserted between pieces. A few paper options from\nthe Cardstock Warehouse fell within our palette, so I mocked them all to see\nwhich felt better. We picked Rust and used a Ghost Toner cartridge to print\nwhite ink on them.\n\nManufacturing the RSVP itself was a significant learning process. I bought a\nCricut Maker 3 to make custom cuts like the half-moon top. It allowed us to\nadd more customization, such as the scoring line for the front flap, debossing\nboth the logo on the top and a box around the QR code, and even the\nopportunity for a gold foil edge piece. It took a lot of prototyping, but I\nfinally produced almost 80 invites on premium heavy-weight cotton cardstock\nfrom LCI Paper. The result was a high-quality invite that looked and felt like\na professional made it.\n\nWeirdly enough, one of the things that got me excited was the envelope labels.\nInstead of having a very large Illustrator document with all the labels for 80\nenvelopes, I built a script that pulled the information from a CSV and\ngenerated a printable PDF on standard letter-sized label paper. I used a few\nCSS parameters to optimize the layout for printing and a simple for loop in\nLiquid to render the labels with minimal effort.\n\n    \n    \n    var list = [] fs.createReadStream('_data/invites.csv') .pipe(csvParser()) .on('data', function(data){ try { let item = { name: data.MAIL_NAME, address: data.ADDRESS } list.push(item) } catch(err) { throw(err) } }) .on('end',function(){ res.render('labels', { content: content, labels: list }) })\n\nJavascript function for all the invite data\n\n    \n    \n    @media print { @page { size: A4; size: portrait; margin: 0.5cm; } li { page-break-inside: avoid; } }\n\nCSS for print format and sizing\n\n    \n    \n    {% for item in labels %} <li> <div class=\"from\"> <p class=\"name\">{{ content.wedding.names }}</p> <p class=\"address\">{{ content.wedding.address | replace: '\\n', '<br>' }}</p> </div> <div class=\"icon\"> {% include 'partials/icons/logo.liquid' %} </div> <div class=\"to\"> <p class=\"name\">{{ item.name }}</p> <p class=\"address\">{{ item.address | replace: '\\n', '<br>' }}</p> </div> <img class=\"image\" src=\"/assets/florals/lilac.png\"> </li> {% endfor %}\n\nLiquid loop for each invite item\n\n## Website\n\nFor the website I looked into using pre-existing services like The Knot or\nSay.ido, but I wasn\u2019t happy with the amount of customization or templates that\nthey offered. Obviously, the next rational decision would be to build it all\nout from scratch. Fair warning: it\u2019s about to get a little nerdy, so if you\ncame for the pretty pictures, I\u2019d skip forward a bit.\n\nWhen I started planning the tech stack, I wanted to keep it lightweight and\nquick to get up and running. My go-to stack leading up to this was a Node.js\nExpress app using liquid.js as the frontend framework, so I went with what I\nknew. I was pulling live data from a database with this website, meaning I\nneeded a dedicated server instead of a static service like Netlify. I dove\ninto the world of Amazon\u2019s AWS services and concluded that the Elastic\nBeanstalk environment was the best for my site. I didn\u2019t realize how\ncomplicated AWS services can be, but I\u2019m so glad I stuck it out and kept\nfiguring out all the required services like Code Pipeline, Route 53,\nCertificate Manager, WAF & Shield, and Key Management Service.\n\nThe first iteration of the page was a simple informational lander for people\nto navigate to when the save-the-date got mailed out. I started with a very\nlow-fidelity wireframe to get an idea of content structure and hierarchy. With\nthat figured out, I worked on adding the branding elements I had already\nfinished earlier. I kept it very minimal and clean, which allowed me to\ndedicate more to some moments of delight, like the \u2018McCarthy\u2019 being written on\npage load, some interactive photo moments in our story, and a cool Instagram\nstory inspired storybook of some photos of Dani and I.\n\nAfter a few months of focusing on other things for the wedding, the proper\nRSVP invites needed to go out. Again, I was thinking about using a pre-\nexisting service, but unfortunately, all the ones I looked at didn\u2019t have an\nAPI I could tap into for a cohesive experience. I returned to the drawing\nboard on how to make our RSVP system from scratch. Dani and I spent a good\namount of time journey-mapping the experience for our users from the mailed\nRSVP all the way to surfacing more relevant information.\n\nBuilding out an online RSVP system meant that I could add features to check in\non your reservation and modify your reservation up until a cutoff date. Every\nwedding I\u2019ve been to, somehow, between RSVP\u2019ing and the actual day of, I\nforget what meals I\u2019ve chosen. I wanted to solve that with this system.\nAnother benefit to building our own system is that it allowed us to serve\nfollow-up information, like accommodation discounts and registry information,\nat specific points in the user journey.\n\nI set up a simple database to keep a record of the submissions and utilized\nunique identifiers for each RSVP group so multiple submissions could be paired\ntogether (i.e., spouses, family members, etc.) and that RSVP group would be\naccessible by a unique link. The link was emailed out upon submission of the\nform using the Sendgrid API and dynamic templates, and the reservation was\nsaved to their browser, so anytime they came to the site, they didn\u2019t need to\nre-enter their email to get their reservation information. It also allowed for\nthe display of dynamic content on the homepage, such as the announcement\nbanner and buttons that told them to either submit or modify their RSVP.\n\nIt was a great exercise for doing more backend development and designing a\nuser experience from all touchpoints. I tried to make everything as efficient\nas possible and automate as much as I could.\n\n## Signage\n\nGetting out of the digital realm, we knew there were going to be a few pieces\nof signage we\u2019d build out ourselves. One of those pieces was an important\nfull-size welcome sign that was branded to match the invites and the rest of\nthe materials. Dani planned out this build herself after I put together the\nscale mockup. We figured out how to cut the pieces out of a singular 8\u2019x4\u2019\nsheet of MDF and got to work. Within a day, the pieces were cut and sanded\ndown in the shape we needed, and we painted the first couple of coats. After\nthe paint had dried completely, Dani\u2019s dad and I made a few collapsable feet\non the backs so they could stand and be transported easily. I brought them\nback to our house and used the Cricut machine to cut out the vinyl lettering\nto place on the front. I wanted a mixed media effect similar to the RSVP, so I\ncut a stencil for the logo on the top and the \u2018McCarthy\u2019 and hand-painted them\nboth. They turned out so much better than I thought.\n\nI made a few other small signs out of MDF and vinyl lettering, along with some\nprinted signage for the tables and areas around the wedding venue. I kept the\nmenus clean and minimal using the leftover paper scraps from the RSVP invites.\n\n## Candles\n\nWhen we were looking for party favours, we went through so many options that I\neither thought were too expensive or weren\u2019t reflective of who we are. I came\nacross a cement candle somewhere online and immediately thought that was a\ngreat opportunity to hand-make the favours and put a little bit of personality\nin the gift.\n\nThis was a huge undertaking, and if I have any advice for people looking to do\nthe same for yours - don\u2019t.\n\nEach candle holder needed to cure for upwards of 12 hours in the mould, and we\nneeded to make roughly 150 of them. It was a lot of trial and error, learning\nabout the differences between cement and concrete and how the temperature in\nour garage can affect the setting of the cement. We paused during winter and\nplanned to start the production line in the spring of 2023. We picked up eight\nmoulds, refined our cement process, and kicked it into high gear.\n\nFor the scent, we went with a tobacco leaf and pine, which the tobacco was a\nnod to Dani\u2019s P\u00e9p\u00e8re and the pine to represent our love for the great\noutdoors. With the help of our friends, we had a candle-making party where we\nmelted and poured wax, stuck labels on the candles, and cut the wicks. We made\nroughly 125 candles.\n\n## Jukebox\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve caught on that the theme of the wedding was \u2018DIY\u2019.\nInstead of going with a DJ, we opted to curate and play a playlist through\nSpotify, but I still wanted the opportunity for guests to request songs.\nThinking about how that could work, I realized I could dive into the Spotify\nAPI and see if there was an opportunity to build something custom. I found the\nspotify-web-api-node library, which plugged in nicely to the existing website\nbuilt in Node.js. With that, I started designing an iPad app experience that\nworked as a sort of Jukebox. I wanted to keep it super simple, with a top\nresult big and bold and other matches in a smaller list view. The bottom bar\nwould display the current playing song and the songs in the queue.\n\nEssentially, the way it works is that you select a playlist as the source of\nmusic to play if there are no requests. If you request a song that exists on\nthe playlist, it will ensure that that song doesn\u2019t play a second time.\n\nThe scaffold for the app structure was pretty simple. There\u2019s an authorization\nroute for credentials handling, an onboarding route for playlist selection, a\nplayer route to handle the current playing song and the queue display, and a\nsearch route for results and queue handling. I added a little database to keep\na record of all the requested songs so we could go back and look at all the\nsongs that were played during the night.\n\nThe benefit of using the same framework for the jukebox as the wedding website\nis that I could give guests the opportunity to start building a playlist of\nsongs before the wedding day. I branded a \u2018Get ahead of the jukebox line\u2019\nfeature, surfaced the module on the homepage and the RSVP details page, and\nlinked to it in emails. It helped us figure out the dance playlist without\nstressing too much over the songs.\n\nIt was a fun little activation at the wedding, and I don\u2019t think there was a\nmoment where the dance floor was empty or the jukebox table didn\u2019t have a\nlittle crowd around it. I wish I could say it worked flawlessly, but the venue\nwifi had a timeout of 15 minutes, so that meant that every 15 minutes, you had\nto reconnect to the wifi. Note to my future self is to use an iPad with a data\nplan or tether my phone from the get-go. Beyond that, it was such a fun\nexercise for me to dive into another app build.\n\n## Recap\n\nThis was one of the biggest moments of my life, so, of course, I had to use my\nskills to go above and beyond. I got feedback from so many people about the\ninvitations, the RSVP experience, and the overall night. In the end, some\nthings didn\u2019t go according to plan, but we didn\u2019t even notice until the next\nday. Being surrounded by the ones we love and those who support us was all we\ncould ask for.\n\n## Interested in seeing what I build next?\n\nGet notified whenever I publish something new, like a new article or a new\nproduct.\n\n  * Instagram\n  * Linkedin\n  * Threads\n  * Twitter / X\n  * Dribbble\n\nChangelog \u2022 Report an issue \u2022 Environmental Impact Promise \u2022 Terms and\nConditions \u2022 Privacy Policy \u2022 Return Policy\n\n\u00a9 2024 Connell McCarthy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
