That is not a weakness; that is life.\u201d This principle denotes\nthat even if you follow the best course of action available to you, you can\nsometimes still end up with a negative outcome, such as failure to achieve\nyour goals.\n\nThe Picard principle is important in many areas of life, so it\u2019s worth\nunderstanding it properly. As such, in the following article you will learn\nmore about this principle, and see how you can use it in practice.\n\nContents\n\nToggle\n\n## Examples of the Picard principle\n\nAn example of the Picard principle is that you can submit a strong application\nfor something like a job or a scholarship, and then get rejected because the\nperson who assessed your application already had a preferred candidate in\nmind.\n\nAnother example of this principle appears in poker, where you can make the\noptimal play mathematically (i.e., the one that\u2019s most likely to win) but\nstill lose, for instance if you bet high on a strong initial hand but then\nlose to someone who got lucky after an initial bad hand.\n\nFinally, another example of the Picard principle is that you can study hard\nfor a test and still do badly, because the material for the test is much\nbeyond your current abilities, or because the instructor designed the test\npoorly.\n\n## Potential benefits and dangers of the Picard principle\n\nAccounting for the Picard principle can benefit you in various ways, since it\ncan:\n\n  * Help you assess situations more rationally. For example, this principle can help you debias irrational just-world beliefs that you have, by illustrating that people\u2019s actions\u2014including yours\u2014don\u2019t always lead to consequences that are fair from a moral perspective.\n  * Help you cope with negative outcomes. For example, this principle can help you internalize that just because you failed to achieve something, that doesn\u2019t mean that you did anything wrong, which can help you express more self-compassion. This, in turn, can also help you get over negative outcomes that you\u2019ve experienced, as well as over negative emotions that are associated with these outcomes, such as guilt or shame.\n  * Motivate you to take action. For example, this principle can push you to overcome the fear of failure, by helping you accept that there are certain factors outside your control, and that you should therefore just take a chance and focus on what you can control.\n\nHowever, the Picard principle can also cause some issues, which are important\nto be aware of. Most notably, it can:\n\n  * Hinder your development and growth. For example, this can happen if you use this principle as justification whenever something goes wrong, without considering whether you made any mistakes, and without taking responsibility for your actions.\n  * Cause negative emotions. For example, this can happen if thinking about this principle makes you frustrated or angry at the unfairness of life.\n  * Demotivate you. For example, this can happen if thinking about this principle makes you feel helpless and as if there\u2019s no point in trying.\n\nThe effects of the Picard principle depend on various factors, such as who is\nusing it, why, how, and in what context. It\u2019s important to consider these\nfactors when deciding whether and how to use this principle yourself, to make\nsure that doing it is more beneficial than harmful, and to make sure that if\nyou do use it, then you do so in the best way possible.\n\nIn summary, the Picard principle has various potential benefits, including\nhelping you assess situations more rationally, cope with negative emotions,\nand feel more motivated to take action. However, it also has potential\ndangers, including hindering personal development, causing negative emotions,\nand serving as a demotivator. The effects of the Picard principle depend on\nvarious factors\u2014such as the reason for using this principle\u2014which are\nimportant to consider when deciding whether and how to use this principle.\n\n## How to use the Picard principle\n\nBefore using the Picard principle, you should first assess the situation, to\ndetermine whether using this principle is a good idea (i.e., whether it will\nlikely be more beneficial than harmful), and if so, what\u2019s the best way to use\nit (i.e., how you can maximize its benefits while minimizing its dangers).\nWhen doing this, you should consider factors such as the context in which\nyou\u2019ll be using this principle, and your reason for using it.\n\nIf you\u2019ve determined that using this principle is a good idea, then the key\nway to do so is to simply remind yourself that it\u2019s possible to make no\nmistakes and still lose, meaning that even if you follow the best course of\naction available to you, you can sometimes still end up with a negative\noutcome. To help yourself internalize this, you can also do the following:\n\n  * Think of relevant examples that support this principle (e.g., cases where a role model of yours did everything right and still lost).\n  * Remind yourself that the universe doesn\u2019t automatically reward things such as effort. In this context, two useful concepts to keep in mind are the just-world hypothesis, which causes people to assume that people\u2019s actions always lead to fair consequences, and the hard work fallacy, which occurs when someone assumes that outcomes must necessarily be proportional to the effort someone puts in, so if they make an effort they will receive correspondingly positive outcomes.\n  * Use cognitive debiasing techniques to help you assess situations more rationally, for example by considering what advice you would give to a friend if they were in your situation.\n\nIn addition, when it comes to dealing with situations where the Picard\nprinciple applies, you can also do the following:\n\n  * Focus on what you can control, rather than what you can\u2019t.\n  * Focus on what you did right.\n  * Focus on what you can learn from your experiences, even if those experiences are negative.\n  * Use debiasing techniques that reduce helplessness and pessimism, such as changing your attributional style to avoid overestimating how long negative outcomes will affect you for.\n  * Use lessons from stoicism to cope with negative emotions, for example by remembering that \u201cThe soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts\u201d.\n\nFinally, note that you can also use a similar approach to help others\nimplement the Picard principle. You can do this in various ways, such as by\nteaching them about this principle, helping them use this principle, or\nguiding their use of this principle by asking them questions that help them\ninternalize it (e.g., \u201cWas there anything you could have done better, given\nwhat you knew at the time?\u201d).\n\n## Origin of the Picard principle\n\nThe quote \u201cIt is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a\nweakness; that is life.\u201d comes from the TV series Star Trek: The Next\nGeneration (season 2, episode 21\u2014Peak Performance). In the episode, Captain\nJean-Luc Picard, after whom the Picard principle is named, shares this adage\nwith Data, an android who serves as an officer on Picard\u2019s starship, when Data\nis disheartened after losing a match in a strategy game.\n\nThis adage has been shared as an inspirational quote in various media.\nHowever, the present article (published here on May 2024) coined the name of\nthe associated principle, and developed the guidelines for implementing it.\n\nNote: Another principle that\u2019s attributed to Star Trek\u2019s Picard by one source\nis the Picard Principle of Intercultural Communication, which is the adage\nthat \u201cCommunication is a matter of patience [and] imagination.\u201d In addition,\nthere is also an unrelated Picard principle in mathematics.\n\n## Summary and conclusions\n\n  * The Picard principle is the adage that \u201cIt is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.\u201d\n  * This principle denotes that even if you follow the best course of action available to you, you can sometimes still end up with a negative outcome, such as failure to achieve your goals.\n  * An example of the Picard principle is that you can submit a strong application for a job, and get rejected because the person who assessed the application already had a preferred candidate in mind.\n  * This principle can help you assess situations more rationally and cope with negative emotions, for instance when you would otherwise criticize yourself too harshly for a failure that wasn\u2019t your fault.\n  * The risks of this principle are that it can lead you to avoid taking responsibility in cases where you should, and that it can cause feelings of frustration and helplessness.\n\n### Other articles you may find interesting:\n\n  * Good Enough is Good Enough: Let Go of Perfectionism to Get Things Done\n  * Cui Bono: Why You Should Ask \"Who Benefits?\"\n  * The Pareto Principle: 80% of Outcomes Come from 20% of Causes\n\nCategories Practical Philosophy\n\nBy Itamar Shatz, PhD\n\n## Latest Articles\n\n  * The Picard Principle: It Is Possible to Commit No Mistakes and Still Lose\n  * Action Bias: Preferring Action Over Inaction\n  * The Platinum Rule: Treat Others the Way They Want to Be Treated\n  * Begging the Question (Petitio Principii): Fallacious Circular Reasoning\n  * The Shirky Principle: Institutions Try to Preserve the Problem to Which They Are the Solution\n\n## Topics\n\n  * Game Theory\n  * Logical Fallacies\n  * Mental Performance\n  * Optimal Learning\n  * Practical Philosophy\n  * Productivity\n  * Social Psychology\n  * Useful Skills\n\nGet a weekly article on psychology and philosophy you can use.\n\n## Key pages\n\n  * Home\n  * All articles\n  * Selected articles\n\nMore content\n\nSubscribe to the newsletter to learn about many other useful concepts in\npractical psychology and philosophy.\n\nAbout | Contact | Privacy | Terms | \u00a9 2024 Effectiviology\n\nFacebookTwitterShare\n\nFacebookTwitterShare\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
