It is a\ngreat way to help your customers choose the right plan for their needs. You\ncan use it to compare different plans, showcase your pricing tier options, or\nsimply provide a way for your users to select a price.\n\nUse cases:\n\n  * Subscription Plans: Offering various subscription tiers tailored to different user needs.\n  * Product Pricing: Dynamically adjusting product prices based on user-selected features or usage metrics.\n  * Service Packages: Providing customizable service packages with different levels of features or support.\n  * Membership Levels: Offering different membership levels with varying access and benefits.\n  * Software Licensing: Implementing tiered licensing models for software products based on usage or functionality.\n\n### Let\u2019s build the structure\n\nUnderstanding the code:\n\n  * x-data=\"{ pageviews: 1000, price: 0 }\": This is the data that will be used to store the pageviews and price.\n  * @input=\"price = (Math.ceil(pageviews / 1000) * 0.001 * 50).toFixed(2)\": This is the event listener that will update the price based on the pageviews.\n  * x-model=\"pageviews\": This is the binding that will be used to bind the pageviews input to the component\u2019s state.\n  * x-model=\"price\": This is the binding that will be used to bind the price input to the component\u2019s state.\n  * <span>$<input type=\"text\" id=\"price\" x-model=\"price\" readonly /></span>: This is the HTML structure that will display the price in a read-only input field.\n  * <label for=\"pageviews\">Pageviews</label>: This is the HTML structure that will display the label for the pageviews input.\n  * <input type=\"number\" id=\"inputPageviews\" x-model=\"pageviews\" @input=\"price = (Math.ceil($event.target.value / 1000) * 0.001 * 50).toFixed(2)\" />: This is the HTML structure that will display the pageviews input field and bind it to the component\u2019s state.\n  * <input type=\"range\" id=\"pageviews\" x-model=\"pageviews\" min=\"1000\" max=\"1000000\" step=\"1000\" @input=\"price = (Math.ceil(pageviews / 1000) * 0.001 * 50).toFixed(2)\" />: This is the HTML structure that will display the pricing slider and bind it to the component\u2019s state.\n  * <label for=\"pageviews\">Pageviews</label>: This is the HTML structure that will display the label for the pageviews input.\n  * <span x-text=\"pageviews.toLocaleString()\"></span>: This is the HTML structure that will display the pageviews value in a read-only input field.\n\nClasses are removed for brevity, but I\u2019ll keep those classes relveant to the\ntutorial.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ pageviews: 1000, price: 0 }\" class=\"w-full\"> <div> <input type=\"range\" id=\"pageviews\" x-model=\"pageviews\" min=\"1000\" max=\"1000000\" step=\"1000\" @input=\"price = (Math.ceil(pageviews / 1000) * 0.001 * 50).toFixed(2)\"\" /> </div> <div > <label for=\"pageviews\" >Pageviews</label > <input type=\"number\" id=\"inputPageviews\" x-model=\"pageviews\" @input=\"price = (Math.ceil($event.target.value / 1000) * 0.001 * 50).toFixed(2)\" /> </div> <div > <p> <span >$<input type=\"text\" id=\"price\" x-model=\"price\" readonly /></span > </p> <div> <label for=\"pageviews\" >Pageviews</label > <span x-text=\"pageviews.toLocaleString()\"></span> </div> <p> This plan is tailored for small businesses and startups </p> <div> <button >Get access</button > </div> <p > Invoices and receipts available for easy company reimbursement </p> </div> </div>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a simple pricing slider that can be used for various purposes, such as\ndisplaying different pricing tiers, showing the number of pageviews, or\nproviding a way for users to select a price. Remember to maker it fully\naccessible and clear to the user when implemtenting the logic on your project.\n\nHope you enjoyed this tutorial and have a great day!\n\n## Reviews and opinions\n\nSee them all\n\n  * \"I bought a beautiful theme from Lexington a couple weeks ago.
