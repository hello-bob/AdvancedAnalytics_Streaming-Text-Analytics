A dramatic\ncontraction ensued soon thereafter: By 2017, that number had nearly halved.\nThe library is now about a third smaller than it was at peak size. There are\nplenty of reasons for this change, but the two primary ones are that the long-\ntail value of \u201cas much cinematic and television history as you can afford to\nhost\u201d wasn\u2019t tremendous and that Netflix gradually realized that it\u2019s more\nspecifically in the business of production and curation.\n\nEvidently, it was right on both counts. Netflix is the giant of its industry\nand has grown only more dominant over time. It has hundreds of millions of\npaying subscribers, exclusive rights to many of its most valuable properties,\nand the power and reach to turn Suits into a sensation. To understand the gold\nstandard of the modern entertainment media industry, look no further: Netflix\nleads the way in scale, interface, and accessibility.\n\nBut we are not here today to discuss the peak of success, exemplified by a so-\ncalled \u201cfrictionless\u201d entertainment product. Consider, instead, an entity that\nhas taken the opposite path in most ways: Tubi, a platform that costs no\nmoney, is cluttered with obscure advertisements, produces unwatchable trash,\noffers a library of roughly 200,000 movies and TV episodes, and\u2014with a crude\nalgorithm and limited search function\u2014is extremely difficult to navigate. Tubi\nis many times the size of Netflix in terms of offerings, but it\u2019s not even 10\npercent as utilized in terms of streaming hours. In general, people would\nrather pay a premium to be aggressively catered to than bother with something\nso unwieldy and unrefined.\n\n#### The Ringer\u2019s Streaming Guide\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of TV out there. We want to help: Every week, we\u2019ll tell you the\nbest and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the ever-\nexpanding heap of Peak TV.\n\nTubi is, however, growing in popularity. Launched in 2014, it has progressed\nfrom a vague slush pile\u2014something akin to the discount DVD bin at Walmart\ncirca 2002\u2014into more of a stimulating, treasure-laden maze for real heads\nseeking a hit of cinematic surprise that more carefully manicured collections\ncan\u2019t offer. Last year, the company announced that it had about 74 million\nmonthly active users. It has surpassed more costly options like Paramount+ and\nPeacock and isn\u2019t far behind Disney+. \u201cThese FAST channels are kind of having\na moment,\u201d says J.D. Connor, a professor of cinematic arts at the University\nof Southern California. \u201cTubi has positioned itself as explicitly the Gen Z\nversion of these [free streamers]. They\u2019re adamant that this is not a kind of\nplay for the cheap old people who just want to watch old shows that they\u2019re\nfamiliar with. And their recent rebrand reeks of a marketing firm that told\nthem, \u2018This is the Gen Z appeal.\u2019 ... They were absolutely willing to spend\ntime and money on a rebrand that would make it clear that this is a younger\ndemographic project.\u201d\n\nTubi appeals to more than just zoomers, though, and there\u2019s significant\noverlap between its users and those who pay for Netflix, Hulu, Max, Peacock,\nor any of the other formidable paid-subscription streaming entities. Since 83\npercent of Americans pay for at least one streaming service, how couldn\u2019t\nthere be? Despite their very real and regular investments elsewhere, they\nstill hold space for Tubi\u2014because something about its delights is so singular.\n\nPart of it is certainly how it approximates the foregone experience of combing\nthrough an oversized video store, or trawling the depths of cable\nbroadcasting, and finding in that morass of mediocrity a gem of screen history\nand vision. Some things feel better when you have to work for them\u2014though, if\nyou don\u2019t want to work too hard, know that Tubi is currently streaming Barry\nLyndon, A Fistful of Dynamite, La Belle Noiseuse, Doctor Zhivago, In the Heat\nof the Night, Blue Velvet, Raging Bull, Red River, The Great Escape, The\nApartment, The Night of the Hunter, and Thief, among probably dozens more\nstone-cold classics that you\u2019ll have to get on your own digital hands and\nknees to locate. Floating in this bloated pool of chum is genuine gold, some\nof the best movies ever made. Tubi has several masterworks by Japanese auteur\nYasujiro Ozu. Tubi has Ingmar Bergman. And, if you scroll just two rows down\nafter searching \u201cIngmar Bergman,\u201d you\u2019ll find a ridiculous-looking 2017 comedy\ncalled Obamaland Part 1: Rise of the Trumpublikans. Like many great thrift\nstores, Tubi is disorganized.\n\nIt would be wrong to argue that Tubi\u2019s primary appeal is that it has good\nmovies. Instead, its primary appeal is that it has lots of movies, and its\nbudget-minded anti-curation approach to arranging them enhances a sense of\nodyssey. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got the rights to that many titles, it\u2019s not about\nfrictionlessness,\u201d Connor says. \u201cIt\u2019s about strangeness and happenstance. You\ndo have to go look for things.\u201d\n\nOfferings more pleasurable than fantastic cinema, for many Tubi heads, are the\ncurious misses. Not total failures, per se; not terrible movies\u2014though there\nare plenty of those on Tubi\u2014but the pictures just a few shades shy of any kind\nof remembrance. They\u2019re all here at one point or another. Like 1994\u2019s Wolf, an\nuneven Jack Nicholson vehicle that can\u2019t quite achieve its aspirational\nbalance of contemporary publishing-industry satire and mythic werewolf saga\nbut occasionally achieves unreasonable amounts of beauty. Hart\u2019s War is a 2002\nWorld War II character drama with Colin Farrell and Terrence Howard about\nAmerican racism traveling with the troops to Germany. It\u2019s a movie that seems,\nat times, to approach greatness but ends without memorable incident. Rush is a\ngrimy cop thriller with an original soundtrack by Eric Clapton. It was the\nmovie that debuted one of his biggest hits, \u201cTears in Heaven,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t\none of the dozen or so movies from 1991 that stuck to any canon. Not a\nclassic, not compellingly bad, not a cult favorite. Just a movie that once\ncame out and now has nowhere to go but here.\n\nSame for the forgotten Brannigan of 1975, one of John Wayne\u2019s last movies. In\nit, Wayne plays a Chicago cop of questionable ethics, sent to England to\nextradite a roaming gangster. AARP John Wayne is turgid, lazily reciting the\nscreenplay\u2019s fish-out-of-water wit, but he\u2019s still his eminently watchable\nself. Then there\u2019s Crazy Joe (1974), a mobster tale with an especially\ncartoonish Peter Boyle, who, deep Tubi crawlers will learn, was a real movie\nstar before he was the mean grandpa on Everybody Loves Raymond. So was the\nsourly cherubic Rod Steiger, who\u2019s all over the service; both are\nconventionally unattractive men, skilled at playing unpleasant characters\u2014once\na formula for A-list success. Tubi remembers that.\n\nIt remembers the ostracized, as well. At times, it looks like a clearinghouse\nfor canceled filmmakers. There is an abundance of the less-esteemed Woody\nAllen and Roman Polanski movies, and tons of Mel Gibson. While other services\nmight be considering whether or not to prominently feature bigots or sex\ncriminals in their fare, Tubi lacks sensitivity readers in its curation\u2014or\nanything else that would be an enemy of affordability and volume. The service\nputs you in the sometimes uncomfortable position of deciding whether these\nexiled men should retain their grip on posterity. That\u2019s definitely more\nincidental than purposeful, though\u2014the controlling idea here is a business\nbuilt around the remainders market, the movie version of books that\ndistributors are not sure whether to try to resell or just pulp and recycle.\n\u201cTubi is part of Fox [since its acquisition in 2020], which is a super strange\ncompany now,\u201d Connor says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have its movie studio, and it doesn\u2019t\nhave the giant Fox catalog\u2014that\u2019s why The Simpsons are over on Disney+. What\nit basically has is its linear network, which lives and dies by the NFL, and\nits declining cable channels. ... And then they\u2019ve got Tubi.\u201d\n\nThe result is less of a house style and more of an endless churn of cinematic\npenny stocks. It\u2019s intellectual property arbitrage, an audiovisual flea market\nof which none of its organizers really understand the breadth and abnormality.\nThe company\u2019s philosophy seems to be that if you build a \u201cvideo store the size\nof today,\u201d people will come, and they will sort it out for themselves.\n\nWhat Tubi does ostensibly pay a little more intentionality to is its original\nprogramming offerings. Since 2021, it\u2019s released a new movie of its own\nroughly once per week. Most of them are bad, and obviously so from the titles\nalone: Titanic 666, Most Wanted Santa, Deadly Cheer Mom, Twisted House Sitter,\nTerror Train, Pastacolypse, The Lurking Fear. It\u2019s mostly horror and thriller\nshlock, junk food for people who just need their screens to produce colors and\nnoise. Only a handful of them even have blue text on Wikipedia\u2014the rest are\nif-a-tree-falls-in-a-forest fare, movies that could easily be ignored by their\nno-name casts for the rest of their lives and never get asked about. Their\nproduction quality is well below that of Lifetime or Hallmark. As one social\nmedia post put it: \u201cTubi outta control I just seen me at the gas station in\none of the movies.\u201d There is a growing audience for these outrageously bad\nselections, predicated on a gleeful embrace of the awful. An extremely\noptimistic view on this trend: Many powerful art movements begin with hard,\nformal limitations, and the resulting absurdities of Tubi\u2019s anemic production\ncrunch for originals\u2014curving bullets, casually slain children, galling\ncontinuity errors\u2014might one day look like the seeds of a bold, new visual\nlanguage.\n\nThis slop runs a wide range demographically, but specific attention has been\npaid to the works made by, and starring, Black Americans. Most of these more\nmemorable, viral hits\u2014like All I Want Is You 2\u2014are not actually produced by\nTubi, just hosted there, but they\u2019ve come to characterize the platform in a\ncolloquial sense, regardless. \u201cIs this a kind of populist creativity finding a\nway into the world or just a business exploiting an underserved audience to\npump out cheap \u2018content\u2019?\u201d asks Niela Orr in The New York Times. \u201cAre these\nmovies furthering Black representation in their own oddball ways or\nembarrassing us with lowbrow clich\u00e9s?\u201d Modern urban literature legend Quan\nMillz, known for titles like This Hoe Got Roaches in Her Crib and Pregnant by\nMy Granddaddy\u2019s Boyfriend, inspires similar questions, and he sees in this\nsection of Tubi an entrepreneurial opening: In 2023, he started a GoFundMe to\nfinance an adaptation of his book Old THOT Next Door made specifically for\nTubi. Whether or not the artistic confluence is ever formalized, it\u2019s clear\nthat at least the shadow of a distinct Tubi style has emerged, intentionally\nor not. (To date, the page has raised $482.)\n\nRelated\n\n#### How \u2018Civil War\u2019 Staged an Attack on Washington, D.C.\n\nA slightly more expensive instance of Tubi\u2019s productions was 2022\u2019s Corrective\nMeasures, starring Michael Rooker (Yondu, from the Guardians of the Galaxy\nmovies), Tom Cavanagh (Ed in NBC\u2019s Ed from 2000 to 2004), and Bruce Willis (in\none of his last movies after being diagnosed with aphasia). It is depressing\nto see Willis so lacking his signature stoic pizzazz, and also to behold this\nmovie in general. There is a special anomie one feels when watching someone\nreally go for it in a broken context, as Cavanagh and Rooker do. The latter\ngives his dialogue more energy than its writers did, leaning into lines like\n\u201cyou fucking fuckface fucker.\u201d Cavanagh plays someone named Gordon Tweedy, or\n\u201cthe Conductor,\u201d who nearly breaks out of what\u2019s supposed to be the world\u2019s\nmost secure prison by channeling electricity through his body. Though he gives\nit admirable effort, Cavanagh cannot perform his way through the small\nspecial-effects budget in this moment. And the so-called \u00fcber-prison looks an\nawful lot like an abandoned elementary school.\n\nTragically low quality might not always be Tubi\u2019s trademark, though.\nEspecially if it keeps doing shrewd things, like the recent decision to be the\nAmerican distributor for the BBC series Boarders. The show, a charming and\ninsightful coming-of-age story about Black students in England\u2019s predominantly\nwhite prep school system, has received praise from Variety, Time, and The\nGuardian, and in America it will be labeled a Tubi Original. Acquiring the\nseries is, obviously, a lot less expensive than making it, but to many, it\nwill look like the Tubi machine is getting sleeker. Tubi\u2019s exclusives also\ninclude a lot of low-effort Vice and TMZ programming, true crime\ndocumentaries, and an animated series called The Freak Brothers, featuring the\nvoices of Pete Davidson, Woody Harrelson, and John Goodman in a Rip Van Winkle\naffair about three siblings who really like to smoke weed and get into modern\nhigh jinks, just as they did back in the \u201960s. In addition, they\u2019ve got\nbroadcast rights to the NBA\u2019s farm system, the G League; random short-form\ndocumentaries about many classic rock albums, such as Steely Dan\u2019s Aja and the\nBeach Boys\u2019 Pet Sounds; cartoons about all of the Old Testament and New\nTestament; full HBO telecasts of old boxing matches; and hundreds of live TV\nchannels.\n\nIn aggregate, these channels are like if the C-tier of a cable TV subscription\nwas free. A lot of it is retro: 24-hour sports highlights from yore; channels\nthat play only Johnny Carson, The Carol Burnett Show, Baywatch, Mystery\nScience Theater 3000, and The Rifleman. There are game shows galore, and talk\nshows, and home improvement shows. Plus various local versions of Fox from\nthroughout the country. You can watch the news live from Bakersfield, Detroit,\nor D.C. Why not?! And, as always, there are diamonds in the rough\u2014turn to the\nWarner Bros. \u201cAt the Movies\u201d channel and you can catch Stanley Kubrick and\nAkira Kurosawa back-to-back.\n\n### Sign up for the The Ringer Newsletter\n\n\u201cThere was this moment when we thought that streaming was going to make the\nlong tail valuable. That was the sort of utopian moment at the beginning of\nall of this,\u201d Connor says. \u201cAnd then we got rid of that idea. There was just\nnot enough oomph in the long tail to make it profitable. The assumption was:\nMaybe only certain things held an audience. But what the fast channels\nsuggest, again, is that the long tail does have value. And if you\u2019re good at\nit, it is a decent business in a world where inflation is persistent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s especially good business when it\u2019s free. At the moment, there\u2019s no way to\npay for Tubi, and no (legal) way around its frequently recurring ads. And,\nyes, because the service is less than premium, the ads can get repetitive.\n\u201cThe Mazda CX-30 commercial is the bane of my existence. I hate it,\u201d says a\nuser on r/TubiTV. Whether this is a flaw or part of its eccentricity is up to\nyou.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t up for debate is that Tubi offers the widest range of possibilities\nof any streaming service out there right now. One person\u2019s ironic\nBlaxploitation revival hub is another\u2019s Criterion Lite, which is still\nanother\u2019s midnight-on-TBS-in-1997 reenactment machine, and still someone\nelse\u2019s best place to watch mediocre stuff from the \u201960s and \u201970s before diving\ninto the world\u2019s biggest archive of made-for-TV crap. The more that people\nrealize how broad and stimulating its offerings are, the more likely Tubi is\nto impact the future of streaming. It might not be on purpose, but Tubi has\nbuilt a kingdom of accessibility and weirdness that could start to make its\ncompetitors look overly staid and unnecessarily expensive. Netflix wants to\nbring you the perfect show in the perfect amount of time. But what if, in a\nworld where the totality of all media ever is theoretically within reach,\nthere\u2019s more joy to be found in the hard work of manually navigating a catalog\nthat\u2019s as vast as it is beguiling?\n\nJohn Wilmes is a writer and professor in Chicago.
