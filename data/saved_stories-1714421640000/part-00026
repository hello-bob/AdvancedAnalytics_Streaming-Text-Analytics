Credit: Institute\nof Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nBeijing\n\nOn the outskirts of Beijing sits a set of unassuming buildings marked \u2018X\u2019, for\n\u2018extreme\u2019. Inside the Synergetic Extreme Condition User Facility (SECUF),\nresearchers from all over the world are pushing matter to its limits with\nextreme magnetic fields, pressures and temperatures, and examining it in new\nways with extremely precise resolution in time.\n\nOne particularly tantalizing goal of many researchers using this\n$US220-million toolbox is to discover new superconductors, materials that\nconduct electricity without resistance. \u201cThis kind of combination of extreme\nconditions offers a very good chance for new discoveries,\u201d says SECUF\u2019s\nfounding director Li Lu, a condensed-matter physicist at the Chinese Academy\nof Science\u2019s Institute of Physics (IOP) in Beijing.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms that underlie superconductivity is an important\nstep in the global race to finding a material that exhibits this phenomenon at\nroom temperature, instead of under frigid conditions. Such a discovery could\nopen the door to faster computers and cut electricity consumption, among other\nbenefits.\n\nUnder extreme conditions, matter exhibits properties that would otherwise\nremain hidden. For instance, when some ordinary-seeming materials are\nsubjected to high pressures and extreme cold, they become superconductors. But\nmeasuring superconductivity can be finicky, because it can show up differently\ndepending on the technique used, says Konstantin Kamenev, a physicist at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh, UK, who specializes in extreme-conditions engineering\nand instrumentation. The ability to mix and match such conditions at a single\nfacility allows researchers to characterize their samples more fully and\nefficiently than they could otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s like a one-stop shop,\u201d says\nJinguang Cheng, a condensed-matter physicist at the IOP.\n\n## Extreme toolbox\n\nSince September last year, all 22 experimental stations at SECUF have moved to\nfull operation after a one-year trial period. Tucked into a corner of one of\nSECUF\u2019s brightly lit rooms, Cheng oversees a station that combines a cubic\nanvil cell \u2014 a device that squeezes materials under enormous pressure on six\nsides \u2014 with two superconducting magnets and helium-based cooling systems. The\nsample-torturing instrument can be used to measure a range of electronic\nproperties and characteristics. Although conventional high-pressure tools,\nsuch as diamond anvils, can accommodate samples that are only the width of a\nhuman hair, SECUF\u2019s cubic anvil cell can compress larger samples, making it\neasier to measure electronic properties in finer detail, says Cheng.\n\nHe says that he and his colleagues have, in this way, discovered a handful of\nsuperconductors, including a rare magnetic one^1 and another based on\nmanganese^2.\n\nBehind a yellow warning barrier at the other end of the room sits a powerful\nsuperconducting magnet. Rui Zhou, a condensed-matter physicist at the IOP, and\nhis colleagues have set up a station that combines the magnet with ultra-low\ntemperatures to perform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The\ntechnique tracks the behaviour of atomic nuclei in high magnetic fields. It\noffers a way of peering into the mechanisms that underlie high-temperature\nsuperconductors \u2014 those that operate above \u2212195.8 \u00b0C.\n\nSECUF\u2019s magnet produces a weaker field \u2014 just 26 tesla \u2014 than do those at\nother facilities, such as the record-holding 45 T hybrid magnet, which is\npartially superconducting, at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory\n(NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida, and the 37 T resistive magnet at France\u2019s\nNational Laboratory for Intense Magnetic Fields in Grenoble, which require a\nlot of power to run. But it can maintain a stable magnetic field for up to one\nmonth instead of a few days or hours, because it guzzles much less power, says\nZhou. That makes it possible for researchers to conduct longer experiments on\nthe same sample, he explains.\n\nAnother magnet system is enabling other types of superconductivity research.\nGang Li, a condensed-matter physicist at the IOP, heads a station that\ncombines blisteringly cold temperatures with a 30 T superconducting magnet and\na 20 T one to detect quantum oscillations \u2014 physical phenomena that are used\nto map the electronic \u2018fingerprint\u2019 of materials. Last July, Alexander Eaton,\na condensed-matter physicist at the University of Cambridge, UK, and his\ncolleagues spent two weeks using the station to unpick the electronic\nproperties of an unusual superconductor called uranium ditelluride^3. \u201cIt was\nthe only place we could do the experiment we wanted to do,\u201d says Eaton.\n\n## Mix and match\n\nOther superconductivity researchers are using multiple tools at SECUF.\nGuanghan Cao, a condensed-matter physicist at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou,\nChina, used the cubic anvil cell and NMR to probe an intriguing chromium-based\nmaterial he had discovered by accident. Cao and his colleagues spotted hints\nof superconductivity when they subjected it to high pressures using the cubic\nanvil cell^4. Over at the NMR station, the researchers were also able to catch\na glimpse of the compound\u2019s magnetic properties. The ability to measure the\nmaterial in multiple ways in one location enabled the researchers to conduct a\nmore in-depth study in less time. \u201cThat\u2019s really convenient for us,\u201d Cao says.\n\nSuperconductivity isn\u2019t the only phenomena researchers are pursuing at SECUF.\nSome researchers are using ultrafast lasers to study the properties of\nsemiconductors, whereas others are using a range of instruments to hunt down\nelusive quantum states of matter. The facility is open to domestic and\ninternational users alike, and all proposals are considered equally, says\nCheng. But the process will be more selective for all researchers this year to\ngive successful applicants more time at each station, he adds.\n\nAlthough researchers from all over the world are using the facility, Ali\nBangura, a condensed-matter physicist at the NHMFL, says that SECUF could give\nChina an edge over other countries in the quest to achieve room-temperature\nsuperconductivity. By expanding the scope of measurements on offer in one\nlocation, SECUF \u201csubstantially increases the likelihood of groundbreaking\ndiscoveries\u201d, says Bangura.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01192-4\n\n## References\n\n  1.
