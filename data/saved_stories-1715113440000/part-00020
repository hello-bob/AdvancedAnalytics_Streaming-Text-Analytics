When Boeing's Starliner capsule lifts off Monday night, this group\nof three will grow to five. Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni\nWilliams, both former US Navy test pilots, will be at the controls of\nStarliner for the ride into low-Earth orbit atop a United Launch Alliance\nAtlas V rocket.\n\n\"The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical\nmilestone,\" said Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator. \"The lives of our\ncrew members, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, are at stake. We don\u2019t take\nthat lightly at all.\"\n\nLaunch is set for 10:34 pm EDT (02:34 UTC), and NASA TV's coverage begins at\n6:30 pm EDT. You can watch below.\n\nAfter liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, Wilmore and\nWilliams will monitor Starliner's systems and take over manual control for a\nfew piloting tests as the spacecraft autonomously approaches the International\nSpace Station. Assuming the launch happens Monday night, docking at the space\nstation is scheduled for early Wednesday. Starliner will remain in orbit at\nleast eight days, with the earliest opportunity to undock and land set for May\n15.\n\n\"It\u2019s a test pilot\u2019s dream\u2014everything we\u2019re doing from start to finish,\"\nWilmore said.\n\nIf you start the clock from the day Boeing announced the Starliner program in\n2010, this moment is running nearly 10 years behind the company's original\nschedule.\n\n\"It\u2019s a little bit of an emotional roller coaster as things were getting\nfixed, or you see a couple steps back, but then you see a couple steps\nforward,\" Williams said. \"We're at that point now. We knew we would get here\neventually. It's a solid spacecraft.\"\n\n## A test pilot\u2019s dream\n\nWilmore, 61, is a native of Tennessee. He will take the left seat in\nStarliner's cockpit as the commander of the Boeing test flight. Williams, 58,\ngrew up in Massachusetts and will serve as Starliner's pilot. Both astronauts\nhave flown to space twice before and have launched and landed on the space\nshuttle and Russian Soyuz capsules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are set to join a small club of astronaut test pilots who have hands-on\nexperience piloting a new type of spacecraft in orbit for the first time.\nAstronauts Doug Hurley, Bob Behnken, and Bob Crippen are the only three\nAmericans alive who can make that claim. Hurley and Behnken flew on the first\nastronaut mission on SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, and Crippen piloted the first\nspace shuttle mission in 1981 alongside commander John Young, who died in\n2018. Yang Liwei, the first astronaut to fly on China's Shenzhou spacecraft in\n2003, rounds out the global club.\n\nArs spoke with Hurley, Behnken, and Crippen in the days before the first crew\nflight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.\n\n\"It's a unique opportunity to get to fly a brand-new spaceship, which is\nawesome,\" Hurley said. \"Those don't come around very often.\"\n\nHurley and Behnken retired from NASA's astronaut corps after their 2020\nmission and now work for Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. Crippen, now\n86, left the agency in 1995 after a stint as director of the Kennedy Space\nCenter in Florida.\n\nThis will be the first time anyone has ever flown on Starliner, and the first\ncrew launch aboard an Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V's 99 previous flights have\nall lofted satellites or deployed NASA probes heading into deep space. Hurley\nand Behnken's flight with SpaceX in 2020 was on the 85th launch of a Falcon 9\nrocket.\n\nCrippen's experience was vastly different. The space shuttle never launched\nwithout people in it, and the first flight of Columbia, known as STS-1, might\nhave been the riskiest mission ever undertaken by NASA. In retrospect, NASA\nofficials calculated there was a 1-in-12 chance that a catastrophic failure on\nthe STS-1 mission could have killed the crew.\n\n\"Butch and Suni are going up on the Atlas V, which is a pretty reliable\nbooster, whereas John and I had a completely experimental spacecraft,\" Crippen\nsaid. \"They both are very experienced astronauts, and they're well-qualified\nto do this.\"\n\nEnlarge / Astronaut Bob Crippen walks down stairs to disembark from the space\nshuttle Columbia following its first landing on April 14, 1981, at Edwards Air\nForce Base, California.\n\nNASA\n\nCrippen met with the Starliner crew at the space center in Florida a few\nmonths ago, when he got a chance to see the Starliner spacecraft up close.\n\u201cSeeing it reminded me a lot of the command module we had from Apollo,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe first Starliner crew has trained together nearly four years. Wilmore\nreplaced the mission's original commander in 2020, and Williams has been\nassigned to the Boeing commercial crew program since 2018.\n\n\"My advice is know the spacecraft as well as you can,\" Crippen said. \"I think\nthey're well prepared. They've had a considerable amount of time ... with the\ndelays they've had.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n103\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
