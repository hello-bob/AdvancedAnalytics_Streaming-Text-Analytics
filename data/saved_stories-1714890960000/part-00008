I think they say that.\n\nAnyhoo, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion of macros in the last year, with me\ngoing on about the redox advantages of carbohydrates and that studies in mice\nshow that branched-chain amino acid restriction reverses obesity. So I thought\nI\u2019d start the year by putting fresh eyes on the historical data that we have\non how macros have changed over time. To my knowledge no one has broken down\nthe old USDA publications into macros all the way down to starch, sugar, SFA,\nMUFA, PUFA, BCAA.\n\nI made this table based on a handful of publications by the USDA. These\nnumbers are my best estimations based on the data presented by the USDA in\nthese publications. The USDA has long defined one \u201cnutrition unit\u201d as a 25\nyear old male. I\u2019m just the messenger. This table represents what would have\nbeen consumed by one nutrition unit. You can more or less ignore the calories\nin the sense of \u201cdid people eat more or less\u201d. They are pulled from different\nstudies using different methodologies and you probably can\u2019t compare them.\nWhat I am interested in is changes in macronutrient composition as a\npercentage of calories and for that you need calories.\n\nWhat I DO think these publications can tell us is trends in macronutrients\nover time. After the table I\u2019ll present the relevant bits of the publications.\nThe 1917 column isn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d (which is why it\u2019s greyed out), it\u2019s the earliest\nsuggested diet published by the USDA. It\u2019s the first food pyramid.\n\nThe first table shows macros as grams consumed per day per nutrition unit.\nTake the absolute numbers with a grain of salt. This is the raw data I used to\ngenerate the second table, which I have more confidence in. Macronutrient\ntrends. Percent of calories by macronutrient over the last century. The\npercentages don\u2019t sum to 100 because I\u2019m using \u201cnet carbohydrates\u201d, so fiber\nisn\u2019t counted as a calorie.\n\n## Let\u2019s see the numbers!\n\n## Notable Trends\n\nHighlighted in red, you can see that starch has declined continuously. The\nrecommendation was 37% of calories in 1917, the actuality was 29% of calories\nin 1920 dropping to 24% of calories in 2001. I\u2019m a fan of starch, I\u2019d argue\nthis is going in the wrong direction.\n\nHighlighted in green, you can see the uptick in polyunsaturated fat after the\nwar. Early USDA publications barely acknowledge the existence of vegetable oil\nand margarine. Although they DID exist. Before 1940 the main sources of fat\nwere dairy, beef and pork (lard). Much of the lard may have been adulterated\nwith cottonseed oil. But who\u2019s counting?\n\nHighlighted in orange: fat become much less saturated in general. Through\n1937, the fat Americans consumed was about half saturated. This dropped to 40%\nby 1965 and 37% by 2000. This is partially due to a rise in liquid oils, but\nalso due to things such as poultry fat (30% saturated) replacing butter (70%\nsaturated).\n\nHighlighted in blue: Americans have always eaten a lot of sugar but the rise\nof soft drinks has pushed this even higher in the modern era. Much of this is\nnow high fructose corn syrup.\n\nProtein: There is an apparent small uptick in protein in the modern era (post\n2000). This is only true in a percentage of calories way. It\u2019s not clear to me\nthat this is real. If it IS real, it\u2019s because chicken.\n\n## The Publications\n\nThe first is \u201cHow To Select Foods\u201d by Caroline L. Hunt and Helen W. Atwater.\nIt was released by the USDA in 1917. I\u2019ve added a menu item called \u201cWhat We\nAte\u201d so that you can easily find these historical publications. This is the\nfirst published dietary recommendation from the USDA. The food pyramid of it\u2019s\ntime. This is their description of the food needed for a man who \u201clike a\nsalesman in a store, walks about more or less and does more or less of such\nwork as lifting.\u201d\n\nThis diet would provide around 350g of starch \u2013 close to half of the calories\nin a 3000 calorie per day diet. By the way, most men burn about 3000 calories\nper day. This is from Pontzer et al published in Science in 2022. 12.5 Mj =\n~3000 kcal.\n\nI didn\u2019t use THAT diet as the recommendation from 1917 (the greyed out column\nin my table), I used the example daily menu scaled to provide 3000 calories.\nDessert is served at both dinner and supper!!\n\n## 1920s and 1930s\n\nI used \u201cPresent Day Diets In The US\u201d by Hazel K. Stiebeling and Callie Mae\nCoons to calculate actual diets (as opposed to recommended) between 1920 and\n1937. This is columns two and three of my table. Much of the data is from this\ntable:\n\nAssuming most of this was consumed, the average American in 1920 ate about 10\nounces of grain; 8 ounces of potatoes; 4.5 ounces of sugar; nearly a pint of\nwhole milk; 2.5 ounces of fat from butter, lard and margarine; two thirds of\nan egg; and 6 ounces each of meat and vegetables. Over this time period grain,\nmeat and potato consumption dropped slightly and were replaced by cheese, ice\ncream and legumes (peanut butter, baked beans).\n\n## 1965\n\nThe next publication is \u201cDietary Levels Of Households In The United States,\nSpring 1965\u201d by the USDA ARS. Milk consumption was higher (but lower compared\nto 1955), grains (6 ounces per day) and potatoes (vegetables) continued their\ndecline. This was the post-war economic boom and meat (13 ounces), milk (20\nounces) and fat consumption were on the rise, replacing starch. This was the\npeak time of calories from fat and coincided with the early messaging to\nreplace solid fats with liquid fats because of the supposed benefits to\narterial health.\n\nThe numbers used in my 1965 column are from the following tables. You can see\nthat margarine, oil and vegetable shortening now have their own listings. I\nused all-purpose flour to represent grains and 70/30 ground beef to represent\nall meats. My goal here is not hyper-accuracy (which is impossible anyway), it\nis to spot high level trends. My calculations from these tables actually came\nout lower in fat (~130g) than the number reported by the USDA in the previous\ntable. I\u2019ve adjusted my numbers up to match their analysis because they were\nthere.\n\n## Modern Times\n\nThe final column is taken from the 2001 NHANES. I\u2019ve used 20-29 year old males\nfor the comparison since (as I mentioned) the USDA reports their number in\n\u201cper nutrition unit\u201d which they define as a 25 year old male. Not my idea.\nThere are a lot of problems with NHANES. I doubt that a nutrition unit was\nconsuming 300 calories less in 2001 than on in 1965. On the other hand,\nmetabolic rates have dropped, so maybe? I still think NHANES is our best guess\nof how trends have changed from a very zoomed out perspective.\n\nFat is now VERY unsaturated and a lower percentage of calories. Starch\nconsumption has continued to dropped into modern times and both have been\nreplaced with sugar, much of which is now consumed as high fructose corn\nsyrup. Americans always liked sugar, of course. They ate it with breakfast,\ndinner and supper.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn the early 20th century, the American diet was based on cheap staples: white\nflour, cornmeal, sugar, rice, oats, potatoes. This was supplemented with as\nmuch milk, eggs, meat and vegetables as could be afforded. As America became\nwealthier, the amount of meat, dairy and fat increased at the expense of grain\nand potatoes. Dietary recommendations beginning in the 1950\u2019s drove trends\ntowards increasingly unsaturated fat and lower fat items. Americans replaced\nthe fat with soft drinks.\n\nWe know this story, more or less, but it\u2019s still nice to look at the\nhistorical documents and confirm our storyline now and again.\n\nPontzer, H., Yamada, Y., Sagayama, H., Ainslie, P.
