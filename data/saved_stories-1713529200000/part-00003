Canter(1953-06-24) June 24, 1953 (age 70)  \nNationality| American  \nOccupation(s)| lawyer (disbarred in 1997), internet businessman  \nKnown for| the first major commercial spam campaign on Usenet  \n  \nLaurence A. Canter (born June 24, 1953) and Martha S. Siegel (born April 9,\n1948) were partners in a husband-and-wife firm of lawyers who posted the first\nmassive commercial Usenet spam on April 12, 1994.\n\nCanter and Siegel were not the first Usenet spammers. The \"Green Card\" spam,\nhowever, was the first commercial Usenet spam, and its unapologetic authors\nare seen as having set the precedent for the modern global practice of\nspamming.^[1]\n\n## Green card spam[edit]\n\nIn early 1994, Canter and Siegel contracted with Leigh Benson to write a\nprogram to advertise on Usenet, but Benson was unable to write their software.\nIn April 1994 they used a Perl script written by a programmer known only as\n\"Jason\", to generate advertisements for their service of enrolling people in a\n\"green card lottery\". This US government program allocates a limited quantity\nof \"green cards\" to certain non-citizens, allowing them to stay and work in\nthe country. The two lawyers offered to do the necessary paperwork for a\nfee.^[1]\n\nCanter and Siegel sent their advertisement, with the subject \"Green Card\nLottery \u2013 Final One?\", to at least 5,500 Usenet discussion groups, an enormous\nnumber at the time.^[2] Rather than cross-posting a single copy of the message\nto multiple groups, so a reader would only see it once (considered a common\ncourtesy when posting the same message to more than one group), they posted it\nas separate postings in each newsgroup, so a reader would see it in each group\nthey read. Their internet service provider, Internet Direct, received so many\ncomplaints that its mail servers crashed repeatedly for the next two days; it\npromptly terminated their service.^[2] Despite the ire directed at the two\nlawyers, they posted another advertisement to 1,000 newsgroups in June\n1994.^[3] This time, Arnt Gulbrandsen put together a software \"cancelbot\" to\ntrawl Usenet and kill their messages within minutes.^[4] Canter claimed in a\nDecember 1994 interview regarding the spam that \"The best I can recall we\nprobably made somewhere between $100,000 to $200,000 related to that\".^[5]\n\nOn May 5, 1994, the couple established a company called Cybersell.^[6] They\npromoted themselves as experts in the then-new business of online retail and\nin February 1995 undertook the first known commercial spamming on behalf of\nclients (so-called \"spam for hire\"). They wrote a book titled How to Make a\nFortune on the Information Superhighway: Everyone's Guerrilla Guide to\nMarketing on the Internet and Other On-line Services (ISBN 0-06-272065-1). In\n1997, Martha Siegel published a revised version titled How to Make a Fortune\non the Internet (ISBN 0-06-273466-0) under her name only.\n\nIn 1997, the Supreme Court of Tennessee disbarred Canter in part for illegal\nadvertising practices. William W. Hunt III, of the Tennessee Board of\nProfessional Responsibility, said at the time that he believed it was the\nfirst time a lawyer had been disciplined for Internet advertising\npractices.^[7]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Cybersell, Inc. v.
