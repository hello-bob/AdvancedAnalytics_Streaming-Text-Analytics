Last time,\nwe looked at the largest of the great Roman wars against the Hellenistic\nsuccessor states, the Roman-Seleucid War (192-188) and the decisive action of\nthat war, the Battle of Magnesia (190). We concluded that, once again, the\nRomans seem to have a clear tactical edge, but what makes that so\ncatastrophically decisive against Antiochus III\u2019s Seleucid Empire were Roman\nadvantages in naval warfare and allies as well as the \u201cremarkable Seleucid\nglass jaw.\u201d\n\nThis week, we\u2019re looking at the last of the major wars that Rome fights\nagainst the Hellenistic \u2018great powers,\u2019 the Third Macedonian War (171-168),\nleading to the decisive Battle of Pydna in 168, after which the Romans, for\nthe first time, simply abolish one of the successors of Alexander. At the same\ntime, as we\u2019ll see, the Roman Republic is able to immediately put the\ndeterrence power of that victory to work forcing an end to the Sixth Syrian\nWar (170-168) between the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom and in the\nprocess setting the Seleucids on their long road to decline while dramatically\nasserting Roman hegemony across the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThis thing is just gonna keep on losing. But the Macedonian light infantry and\ncavalry actually fare a little better this week, until they don\u2019t.\n\nBut first, if you like what you are reading here and want to help out this\nproject, please share it \u2013 I rely on word-of-mouth for all of my readers.

The peace also limited\nPhilip V to a 5,000 man army and a token navy.\n\nThat limited army and the need not to anger Rome meant that Antigonid\nambitions would have to be curtailed for a time, but it is clear that Philip V\nwas not idle. On the one hand, he supported Roman military operations in the\nregion (particularly in the Roman-Seleucid War) as a means of avoiding further\nRoman intervention in the region. One may read his support for Rome against\nAntiochus III in particular as a bid to remove Rome\u2019s excuse for remaining\nheavily involved in his own backyard. Meanwhile, Philip V appears to have\nturned inward towards what strength Macedon proper could provide. Livy (39.24)\nreports that Philip V expanded state revenues from agriculture, trade and\nmining, while both encouraging natural population growth but also moving\nsubstantial numbers of Thracians into his kingdom to provide for more\nmanpower. The irony then is that this reduced Antigonid state will meet Rome\nwith greater financial resources and more men than the much larger Antigonid\nstate of the late 200s.\n\nPhilip V dies in 179 and is succeeded by his son, Perseus. Perseus himself\nseems to have been anti-Roman in outlook, in contrast to his brother\nDemetrius, who had been held as a hostage in Rome and seems to have been much\nmore pro-Roman in outlook (e.g. Livy 39.53.1-6). We\u2019re told that Perseus,\nfearing that when his father died the Romans would supplant him with the more\npliant Demetrius, schemed to incriminate him in a plot against Philip V in the\nlast years of his reign and have him killed, thus clearing the way for Perseus\nto take the throne without opposition.\n\nVia Wikipedia, a tetradrachma of Perseus, minted early in his reign. The\nreverse, conveniently, reads, \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 \u03a0\u0395\u03a1\u03a3\u0395\u03a5\u03a3, \u201cKing Perseus.\u201d Note the cloth\nfillet he wears: that is the royal diadem, the Macedonian equivalent to a\ncrown.\n\nRelations between Perseus and Rome seem to have soured fairly quickly. Livy,\nour main source for this, presents Perseus as implacably anti-Roman, having\nplotted since before he was king to fight Rome (Livy 42.5.1) and so when he\nbecomes king began preparing to do so. In practice, Perseus, it seems to me,\nwas of a similar mind to the other Hellenistic rulers of this day, especially\nAntiochus IV (r. 175-164). Remember that by this point the successors of\nAlexander had been fighting over his empire for a century and a half, with\nvariable fortunes. In that context, it was reasonable to suppose that Rome was\njust one more contestant in the ring, whose fortunes would rise and then fall.\nConsequently, a few decades after Rome\u2019s great victory, with a renewed\nkingdom, it made sense to begin attempting to reestablish the Antigonid\nposition, the same way Antiochus IV was, at this very moment, reestablishing\nthe Seleucid position and would soon attempt a renewed conquest of Egypt.\n\nWhat may have actually set Demetrius apart \u2013 though our sources give no\nindication of this, so take this as the pure speculation that it is \u2013 was\nthat, having been in Rome, he might have been a bit more aware of the degree\nto which the Roman Republic was a different creature than the Hellenistic\nkingdoms. After all, being in Rome, first as a hostage and later as a\ndiplomat, he couldn\u2019t have been unaware of how many other wars Rome was\nwaging, almost continuously in this period. and how substantial the military\nforces Rome kept continuously deployed. After all, in the last ten years of\nPhilip V\u2019s reign (so from 189 to 179), Roman annual deployments never slip\nbelow about 110,000 men in any year. By contrast, the Antigonids will never\ndeploy more than about 50,000 at any point in their history. But that massive\ndisconnect might simply not have been obvious for an eastern Mediterranean\nstate which might, understandably, be ill-informed about the seemingly endless\nRoman wars in Spain, Northern Italy and Gaul.^2\n\nMeanwhile, agitating for renewed war in the region was Eumenes II of Pergamum\n\u2013 the fellow who won on the Roman wing at Magnesia \u2013 who clearly saw a\nresurgent Antigonid Kingdom as a threat and also stood potentially to gain at\nthe expense of Perseus by greater Roman involvement. Seizing on the fact that\nPerseus seemed to be wooing the Greek poleis to resistance to Rome (which he\nwas), Eumenes came to Rome in person (or perhaps he sent his brother, though\nLivy thinks it was Eumenes, Livy 42.11.1) to claim that Perseus was preparing\nfor war. Perseus\u2019 own embassy, predictably, denied the charge but got little\nhearing, in part because they didn\u2019t seem particularly afraid to risk a war if\nit came to it (Livy 42.14.2-4). Interestingly, a number of Greek states,\nfearing that Eumenes rather than Perseus, might use a war to establish his\ncontrol of the region, appealed to the Romans in the opposite direction, but\nsucceeded mostly in irritating the Senate for abusing such a stalwart Roman\nally in their speeches (Livy 42.14.9-10). As a result, late in 172 the Romans\nmove for war against Perseus and the Third Macedonian War begins.\n\n## Armies and Allies\n\nPerseus responds to the Roman declaration of war by assembling his own army at\nCitium (in Macedon, not the Citium on Cyprus) and Livy provides a report of\nthe forces he assembled there (Livy 42.51). Michael Taylor breaks down the\nnumbers^3 \u2013 which require a touch of interpretation due to the way Livy\npresents them \u2013 as consisting of 21,000 Macedonian phalangites, 5,000\nMacedonian peltasts (elite heavy infantry, not skirmishers \u2013 the 2,000 man\nroyal guard, the agema is drawn from this number), 3,000 Macedonian cavalry,\n3,000 Paeonians and Agrianians (probably light infantry), 2,000 Gauls (medium\ninfantry), 3,000 \u2018free Thracians\u2019 and 1,000 Odrysian Thracians (medium\ninfantry) along with 1,000 Odrysian cavalry, 3,000 Cretans (missile troops),\n500 Aetolians and Boeotians (thureophoroi?) and probably another 500 Greek\nmercenaries (thureophoroi?) because that is what makes the numbers add up. All\ntold, a force of 39,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry and the strongest army that\nMacedon proper had marshaled since Alexander. Perseus\u2019 alliance with Cotys IV,\nking of the Odrysians \u2013 the largest polity in Thrace \u2013 clearly pays off here,\nbut beyond that most of his troops seem to be mercenaries rather than the\nproduct of robust local alliances. Notably, for all of the effort Perseus had\nspent courting the Greeks in the years before this, he gets very little in the\nway of useful military force from them and one imagines he probably had to\n\u2018overpay\u2019 for what meager Greek troops he did get.\n\nVia Wikimedia Commons, Thracian warriors painted in fresco (c. 300 BC) from\nthe Thracian tombs at Kazanlak. The fellow on the left carries a short,\nforward curving blade that may be a one-handed falx (but could also be a\nkopis), while we see the top of a polearm above and behind teh infantryman on\nthe right which could be the tip of the Thracian rhomphaia, a distinctive\nThracian weapon, a forward-curved blade with a long handle. Thracians had a\nwell-earned reputation as capable fighters.\n\nClearly, Philip V and Perseus\u2019 efforts to strengthen the core Antigonid realm\nhad succeeded, though it is also worth noting that another reason for this\nrelatively large mobilization was actually defeat: the loss of territory in\nthe Second Macedonian War had freed the Antigonid state from the need to\ngarrison those areas. The fact that this increases the effective military\npower of the state speaks to the limited degree to which the Antigonid kingdom\ncould really have ever drawn military force from many of its conquests. Unlike\nthe Romans in Italy, who had a very effective system for converting conquered\npeoples into military force, the Antigonids never quite figured out how to\nturn their control of Greece into a military asset instead of a military\nliability. To be fair, the Romans also make no attempt to draw meaningful\nmilitary force out of Greece, leading one to assume that the fractious nature\nof the Greek poleis and federal leagues, as well as their relative military\nweakness might have meant that effectively any attempt to actually draw\nmilitary force out of Greece in this period was likely to be counter-\nproductive.\n\nSuch an army was clearly formidable, though as we\u2019ll see, Perseus never quite\ngets all of it on to the field at any one point. On the other hand, the Romans\nfor the year 171 are deployed as follows: Of the consuls, Gaius Cassius\nLonginus was assigned Italy as his province and spent most of the year bashing\nup the Gauls in Cisalpine Gaul (the Senate has to stop him from trying to\ninvade Macedonia through Illyria), while Publius Licinius Crassus (Publius,\nnot Marcus) is assigned the province of Macedonia. Of the praetors, C.\nCaninius Rebilus is in Sicily, L. Canuleius Dives is in Spain, L. Furius\nPhilus is in Sardinia and C. Lucretius Gallus is assigned the fleet to support\noperations against Macedonia. We also have a few brief pro-magistrate\nholdovers from the previous year in Spain and Greece, mostly holding until the\nnew magistrates could arrive to release them. All told, the Romans have ten\nlegions under arms in the year, for a rough count of 110,000 soldiers, of whom\nonly 12,600 Romans and 16,800 socii (29,400 total, 1,400 of which were\ncavalry, the rest infantry) were bound for Macedonia. To stiffen this force,\nthe Senate also permits Crassus to enroll older veteran soldiers and\ncenturions and to appoint (rather than elect) their military tribunes,\npresumably also to get experienced men in the roles (Livy 42.31.4-5).\n\nFrom that figure, the immediate strategic problem, which it is not clear if\nPerseus understood, should be obvious. That Roman army will require Perseus\u2019\nwhole, undivided attention in order to stop (though he does handily outnumber\nit if he can concentrate his whole army at a point), but it represents less\nthan a third of Rome\u2019s total military commitments for the year \u2013 and a year\nthat, while it wasn\u2019t a low activity year, was also nowhere near a Roman\nmaximum effort either. And the small seeming Roman army could also, of course,\ncount on reinforcements from allies in the region. Chief among these, of\ncourse, was Eumenes II of Pergamum, but the Romans also could expect at least\nsome military assistance from both the Achaean and Aetolian Leagues, as well\nas from the Thessalians (who had been removed from Antigonid control by the\nRomans in the Second Macedonian War), though it is clear that political\nsympathies among the Greeks were split.\n\nConsequently, the Romans could pressure Perseus at this level of military\nengagement effectively forever if they had to. Roman command of the sea \u2013\nwhich Perseus was entirely unable to challenge \u2013 meant that Roman armies could\nbe brought from Italy into Greece via Apollonia and Perseus could do nothing\nto stop them. Yet Perseus does not appear anxious to avoid a war with Rome in\nthe run-up to hostilities but is content to adopt a largely defensive\nstrategy, which suggests that he seems to have thought he could win on the\ndefensive, perhaps exhausting Roman efforts, and perhaps in the process\nreassert the previously dominant Antigonid position in Greece.\n\n## Callinicus\n\nLike the Second Macedonian War, this war is one where a lot of the maneuvers\nare defined by the problems created by the mountainous topography of the\nregion, however the area of operations has shifted and so we are concerned\nwith different mountains and passes than before. Whereas the problem in the\nSecond Macedonian War had been how to break through the mountains separating\nthe Adriatic coast (and the Roman port at Apollonia) from Thessaly, for the\nThird Macedonian War, the Romans start with a foothold in Thessaly (the cities\nof which were nominally independent) and the question is how to slip past Mt.\nOlympus into Macedon-proper from northern Thessaly, though of course before\nthey can do this the Romans will first have to secure northern Thessaly as a\njumping-off point.\n\nVia Wikipedia, a map of ancient Thessaly. Note especially the locations of\nLarissa on the central-eastern section along the Peneus River as well as the\nPerrhaebia, the more mountaineous, less densely settled northern spur of the\nregion.\n\nMilitary operations begin in earnest in 171. Crassus moves his army\nsuccessfully across the Adriatic to Apollonia, then cuts through the mountains\nto break out into the open plains of Thessaly, making his camp a short\ndistance off from Larissa, the chief city of the region. Perseus, meanwhile,\nhad moved south out of Macedon into northern Thessaly and proceeded to secure\nthe northern part of the region, negotiating the surrender of some towns and\nassaulting others in a series of actions probably meant to secure the\napproaches to the passes that led up to Macedon and perhaps secure his own\nbase of supply for operations in Thessaly, as Perseus seems, at this point, to\nhave intended to try the Romans in pitched battle in Thessaly. This\naccomplished, Perseus attempts to draw the Romans out with some raiding and\nforaging, which succeeds in getting Crassus to move his camp up to Larissa in\ncentral Thessaly, as previously mentioned. Larissa sits on the Peneus River\nwhich cuts across Thessaly west-to-east, and at this point effectively divides\nthe zones of Roman control, south of the river, and Macedonian control north\nof it (all of these actions are Livy 42.53-55).\n\nThat sets the stage for the first significant battle of the war, the Battle of\nCallinicus (171), effectively an overgrown skirmish. Perseus moves his army in\nforce towards Larissa, evidently knowing the Romans\u2019 general position but not\nfully informed of their strength or precise disposition (Livy 42.57.8) but\nclearly looking to provoke at least a skirmish if not a general engagement. A\nminor and brief skirmish ensues on contact, but evidently not the larger\nbattle Perseus hoped for and so Perseus begins deploying his cavalry and light\ninfantry in the same area each day, hoping to draw the Roman cavalry and light\ninfantry into a fight; Crassus in turn refused the engagements, deploying his\nown light troops and cavalry but not engaging, in a rather un-Roman-like turn\n(Livy 42.57.9-12).\n\nPerseus now springs a rather clever trap. Having lulled the Romans with the\napparent consistency of his deployments, he moves his camp forward much closer\nto the Roman camp and moves his troops out earlier than usual, occupying a\nhill near the Roman camp called Callinicus (thus the name of the battle)\nbefore the Romans were prepared to meet him. Crassus now responded by\ndeploying his own cavalry and light troops, though both armies kept their\nheavy infantry back (the Roman infantry deployed on the ramparts to defend the\ncamp, if necessary). The Roman force was a mix, with Roman and socii cavalry\nand light troops (including the socii cavalry extraordinarii, a picked group\nof elite cavalry drawn from the socii), along with Greek allies, with Eumenes\u2019\nPergamese cavalry in reserve.\n\nAfter an initial exchange of missiles (Livy 42.59.1), Perseus\u2019 Thracian\ncavalry charged the Roman right wing and disrupted the socii cavalry deployed\nthere, but didn\u2019t yet chase them off (Livy 42.59.2-3), and then Perseus\nhimself hammered the center of the Roman position, scattering Rome\u2019s Greek\nallies (this passage is a bit odd, because Livy put the Greek allies not in\nthe center, but on the left, 42.58.12 and one wonders if perhaps he \u2013 or his\nsources \u2013 is doing a bit of patriotic cover for the failure of the socii\nextraordinarii in the center failing to hold their ground). While the southern\nGreeks evidently fall apart, the Thessalians \u2013 long famed for having the best\ncavalry in Greek \u2013 managed a fighting withdrawal, grouping up with Eumenes\u2019\nreserve (Livy 42.59.5-6). At this point, Perseus\u2019 heavy infantry begins to\ncome up and the king apparently considers making a general attack, but is\npersuaded not to, instead withdrawing having inflicted quite a bit more damage\non the Romans than he took in return (Livy 42.59.8-11).\n\nRoman losses were sharp, with 200 cavalry and 2,000 light infantry lost in the\nskirmish and another 600 captured, to Perseus\u2019 losses of only 60 (Livy\n42.60.1); Crassus responded by retreating across the Peneus and the morale of\nhis army soured, as you might imagine, with bitter recriminations (mostly at\nthe Aetolians, who fled first) in the council of war. Perseus then attempts to\nnegotiate a peace, which the Romans refuse; that Perseus and his councillors\nthought the Romans might be moved to peace with such a tiny skirmish, I think,\nreflects a failure to understand both the Roman strategic position and also\nthe Roman mentality. For Rome to back down at this point would mean largely\nsurrendering their position in the Eastern Mediterranean and giving other\nrulers, like the restive Antiochus IV (soon to start his own war against\nEgypt) a green-light. The Romans would hardly accept such strategic losses\nbecause of such a mild bloody-nose and so it is strikingly odd that Perseus\nand his advisors thought such negotiations might work (Livy 42.62.6-7).\n\nWhat follows this is a bit of frustration in our sources. The Romans engage in\nforaging operations, while Perseus moves his camp forward to Mopselus to\nharass them, with Perseus managing to ambush some of the foraging operations\nwith a small force (Livy 42.65.2-6), which then again leads to a potentially\nlarger engagement. What Livy then reports is first, in his own voice, that\nPerseus gets the advantage in the skirmish but is too late to bring up his\nphalanx, leading to a brief engagement primarily of light troops in which\nPerseus takes just 324 losses, after which Perseus, unable to get his\ndisordered phalanx into fighting formation in time, instead withdraws (Livy\n42.66.5-8) and Crassus, \u201ccontent with his modest success\u201d (contentus modico\nsuccessu; this is not a complement) lets them. Then Livy notes that \u201cthere are\nthose who affirm that there was a great battle on that day, that eight\nthousand enemies were killed, among whom were the king\u2019s officers Sopater and\nAntipater; that around 2,800 were captured alive and 27 military standards\nwere captured. Nor was it a bloodless victory, more than 4,300 of the consul\u2019s\narmy were slain and five standards belonging to the left wing were lost.\u201d^4\n\nWhat Livy is signalling with that, \u201cthere are those who say that...\u201d opening\nis that he doesn\u2019t believe them and frankly, I don\u2019t either. While Livy\ndoesn\u2019t name those sources, one quite immediately suspects the Late Annalistic\ntradition (e.g. Valerias Antias) and that the situation Livy is in is that his\npreferred source (Polybius) has reported merely a skirmish, while his other\nsources (the annalistic ones) have reported a big battle. Livy thus concludes\nthat the late annalistic sources have invented a victory, perhaps as a\npatriotic cover for the embarrassment at Callinicus, when in fact the fight\nwas much smaller. I am inclined to agree with Livy\u2019s judgement \u2013 Polybius is\nunlikely to have left out such a major battle (the Polybius for this period is\nlost to us) and Livy is unlikely to have expressed such skepticism about\nPolybius\u2019 report. More to the point, Perseus\u2019 actions immediately following\nthis don\u2019t imply the kind of retreat that a battle with 8,000 casualties would\ncreate.\n\nInstead, Perseus stays at his camp at Mopselus for a few days (Livy 42.67.1),\nthen moves back into Macedon, dispersing his army into winter quarters (at\nhome, where supplies would be secure); he also releases Cotys IV and his\nThracians to head home to deal with problems being stirred up by some of\nEumenes II\u2019s forces in Thrace. This is not the action of a king retreating to\nhis kingdom after a sore defeat and potentially facing pursuit, but of one who\nhad tried to pull the Romans into a major battle on favorable grounds, hadn\u2019t\nquite managed it and had exhausted the campaigning season. Crassus, attempting\nto salvage something, anything, from a dismal year, attempts to seize the town\nof Gonnus, which guarded the approach to the Vale of Tempe, the main route\ninto Macedonia (to which we will, in a moment return). Crassus is unable to\ntake the town, but secures a few other minor towns in northern Thessaly (Livy\n42.67.6-8), but accomplishes little otherwise, aside from pillaging some Greek\ntowns so unnecessarily that the Senate later ordered the captives restored\n(Livy Per. 43.2-3). It will thus not surprise you to learn that he is not\nretained in command the following year.\n\n## Getting Into Macedon\n\nInstead, the Roman command for 170 goes to Aulus Hostilius Mancinus.^5 We\u2019re\nless well informed about the actions in 170, because book 43 of Livy, which\nwould have told us about it, isn\u2019t entirely complete and so Livy\u2019s narrative\nhere is mostly missing. In practice, the Roman problem, now that Thessaly was\nlargely secured, was getting into Macedon proper to force Perseus into battle.\nThat effort, in turn, had one particular obstacle, namely that Mount Olympus\nwas in the way, which is a pretty decent obstacle, all things considered.\n\nOne again, I am leaning quite hard on J.N. Morton\u2019s dissertation, \u201cShifting\nLandscapes, Policies and Morals: a Topographically Driven Analysis of the\nRoman Wars in Greece from 200 BC to 168 BC\u201d (2017), because the problems the\nRomans face in 170 and 169 are fundamentally topographical in nature. Some\nmaps here are necessary to understand the issue. I am quite bad at maps, but\nhere I will try my best; there are better maps in Morton\u2019s dissertation, which\nyou can find with a bit of googling. Let\u2019s start with the big picture here:\n\nI\u2019ve only marked the traditional core kingdom of Macedon here, but the\nAntigonid state was larger than this. Still, it gives a good sense of where\nthe Romans intend to go.\n\nAnd you can begin to see the problem, in that the Romans have to get from\nThessaly over some fairly formidable mountains to get into Macedon, no matter\nwhat direction they go. Moreover, while Thessaly was a agriculturally rich\ncountry which could easily supply Roman armies, the moment those armies move\nout of central Thessaly, they\u2019re moving off of their supply bases and into\nmore thinly populated regions, until they reach the open plains of Macedon,\nwhere they could resupply by foraging or by bringing in grain via ship through\none of the ports there. But, as you may note, the straight line route from\nThessaly to Macedon passes directly over Mount Olympus, the tallest mountain\nin Greece. Moreoever, the goal here is that southern spur of Macedon, called\nPieria, which in turn bottlenecks repeatedly on the way up the coastal road,\nwith the northernmost bottleneck, Pydna, marked here.\n\nAs we zoom in, Roman options narrow even further. We can dispense first with\nthe options not taken. The most direct route would be via the Vale of Tempe,\nfollowing today what is the E75 to the coast, from where one could simply\nfollow the coastal plain up into that southern spur of Macedonia (which is\ncalled Pieria). The problem is precisely that this route is obvious and the\nTempe Pass cut by the Peneus River is both really narrow at points and also\nwell-blocked by Macedonian garrisons. Alternately, you could try to get cute\nand move through Epirus, bypassing Thessaly and instead trekking through the\ncentral Pindus mountains to surprise the Macedonians from the west. But the\nIllyrians and Epirotes on the route aren\u2019t particularly friendly and the\nterrain for that kind of effort is unfavorable. That leaves essentially two\noptions: you can take the pass on the north side of Olympus, or the pass on\nthe south side of Olympus. Finally, you could head straight north to Elimea\n(where Lake Polyfyto is now), more or less following the route of the GR-3/E65\nto get out of Thessaly, but then you have simply delayed the problem of where\nand how to descend into the Macedonian plain. This route is considered by the\nRomans, and Mancinus may have attempted it, to no avail. That leaves just two\noptions:\n\nYou can go north around Mt. Olympus, through the Petra pass; this terrain here\nis the most challenging, but it drops out out cleanly into central Pieria,\npotentially behind Perseus. The more tempting route is the Lake Ascuris (now\ndrained, but at the time, there was a lake) Pass, which drops you off at the\nsouthern end of Pieria, just above the top of the Tempe Vale, but terrain\nhere, while not as bad as the Petra pass, is not good. Both routes now feature\npaved roads, but at this early point, for a Roman army with limited local\nknowledge, either route is going to require local guides to avoid getting lost\nas one moves through the passes over the mountains. Perseus, meanwhile, can\nbase his army between the two passes, post garrisons on the passes and\nlookouts on the hills and wait to see which one the Romans try to take and\nthen block them, all while the Romans\u2019 supply \u2018timer\u2019 is running down because,\nremember, they\u2019ve moved out of central Thessaly and its rich supply areas to\ndo this, and don\u2019t have easy access to a coast to naval resupply. And this is\nexactly what Perseus does.\n\nAs mentioned, we\u2019re not well informed about the campaigns of 170. Aulus\nHostilius Mancinus seems to have skirmished unsuccessfully in Thessaly with\nPerseus before trying that northern route through Elimeia but Perseus seems to\nhave anticipated his movements and the year ends with the Romans back in\nThessaly and Perseus back in Macedon. We\u2019re better informed about 169.\nMancinus\u2019 year ends and he is replaced by Quintus Marcius Philippus, a senior\nRoman politicians (he had been consul before, in 186) but a checkered war\nrecord who then has to navigate this problem. He considers three routes in his\ncouncil of war: the northern route, the Petra pass and the southern route past\nLake Ascuris and repeating Mancinus\u2019 route through Elimeia, aiming to keep\nsome optionality, loads up on a month\u2019s worth of supplies and heads into the\nPerrhaebia (that northern-most spur of Thessaly), where he could conceivably\ntake any of the routes. Perseus responds by guarding all three of the routes,\nsplitting his army in four (one garrison for each route, plus a core force\nPerseus keeps with himself to reinforce whichever direction the Romans go).\n\nPhilippus ends up attempting the southern route, past the now-drained Lake\nAscuris, aiming to drop out north of the Vale of Tempe. Philippus gets himself\ninto some trouble in the passes \u2013 while both generals are working without\nexact knowledge of the other, Perseus seems to have guessed Philippus\u2019 route,\nas he defended it the most heavily \u2013 but manages to get himself out and\ndescends into Pieria, having lost a fair bit of time.\n\nPerseus, his army currently divided, pulls back, retreating with his army and\nmuch of the food supply to Pydna, the northernmost bottleneck. But Philippus\nalso has a serious problem: supplies. Morton (op. cit.) tallies the days, but\nin essence it took Philippus a bit over ten days to get to the Lake Ascuris\npass, and then another roughly ten days to get through them, with a lot of\ntime wasted in skirmishing and dealing with the Macedonian force there. So\nwhen he drops into the Pieria, he has a fairly limited food supply (as, you\nwill recall, he loaded up a month\u2019s supply, which is quite a lot). Philippus,\nfor all that effort, ends up with just enough time to secure his route out by\ntaking Heracleum \u2013 the southern bottleneck between the Pieria and the Tempe\nVale \u2013 and then heads back to Thessaly to resupply and wait out the winter.\nAnother campaign that had mostly fizzled out and Perseus reasserts control\nover the Pieria, rebasing to Phila at its southern end (just south of\nHeracleum, for those keeping track of places).\n\nIn fact, as Livy notes (44.6.3), the Romans had largely avoided disaster\nbecause of Perseus\u2019 panic when Philippus finally gets through the mountains.\nHad Perseus simply gathered his army and tried to hold his garrisons,\nPhilippus would have rapidly run out of food still trapped between Perseus (in\nthe central Pieria) and the Macedonian garrisons in Heracleum and the Vale of\nTempe. Perseus could have \u2018bagged\u2019 an entire Roman army here, but loses his\nnerve and misses his chance.\n\nAnd if you are thinking, \u201cwait, so Perseus loses his nerve and misses his\nchance for a major victory at Callinicus, and then again skirmishing later\nthat year, and again now \u2013 is this going to be a thing with Perseus?\u201d Yes. It\nis.\n\nIn any case, the Romans are not impressed by Philippus spending the season\nblundering through a pass, nearly running out of food and ending up mostly\nback where he started, so he too is not retained in command, with the new\nconsul Lucius Aemilius Paullus assigned the job, although it will take him\nsome time to get to the theater from Rome.\n\nPaullus has at least some advantages: the route through Tempe is now clear, so\nwhen he arrives and takes up command of the army (reinforced, as we\u2019ll see in\na moment), he can move through the Vale directly to Phila, meaning we\u2019re now\nconcerned not with the passes but rather with the bottlenecks of Pieria.\n\nVia Wikipedia, a map of the region, with the key bottlenecks noted. At the\nnorthern end, Pydna blocks access to central Macedon, while Philia at the\nsouthern end controls access to the Vale of Tempe. Heracleum (or Heraklion,\nmore faithful to the Greek) and Dion are the central bottlenecks.\n\nAs Paullus moves to Philia, Perseus opts to drop back to the Elpeus River,\nnear Dion, where he constructs a fort on the banks that evidently was quite\nformidable (Livy 44.32.6-10; Plut. Aem. 13.5). And it is worth pausing here\nfor a moment to try to assess Perseus\u2019 plan in all of this. I think it is\nfairly clear at this point that Perseus doesn\u2019t have the nerve to try a\npitched battle, at least not intentionally. Instead, he keeps opting for the\ncautious approach of confronting the Romans behind favorable terrain and\ntrying to stall out their campaigns from the logistics difficulty of operating\nin the region. And so far, that has kind of worked. As the crow flies, the\nRomans have, at this point, spent three years moving about 20 miles from\nnorthern Thessaly to their tenuous foothold on the southern end of Pieria.\nPerseus presumably hopes that putting the Romans in an endless series of\ncampaigns where they lose light infantry and cavalry skirmishes before running\nlow on supplies and having to head back to Thessaly will either sap the Roman\nwill to continue or prompt some sort of fatal rashness allowing Perseus to\nengage in battle on extremely favorable circumstances; Plutarch (Aem. 13.4-5)\nexplicitly attributes to him this sort of delaying strategy. I say\n\u2018extremely,\u2019 because as Livy notes, Perseus has had the chance to engage on\nmerely very favorable circumstances and retreated instead.\n\nI don\u2019t think this strategy could have ever worked long-term. The Romans were\nwilling to put up with far greater and more frustrating campaigns in areas of\nfar less strategic significance. The First Punic War (264-241) was, as the\ndate labels there imply, a twenty-three year long high intensity war. Perhaps\nmore apt a comparison, the Romans will be attempting to seize the Celtiberian\nstronghold of Numantia (and thereby end Celtiberian resistance in Spain) for\ntwenty-one years, from 154 to 133 BC, albeit with some pauses. It is a similar\ncampaign in that the Romans are struggling with the logistical difficulty of\nactually applying their army to the target, combined with clever opponents who\nknow the local terrain. I do not think Perseus could actually wait the Romans\nout, but that may not have been clear to him at the time.\n\nIn any event, Perseus\u2019 luck has run out, because the new Roman consul, Lucius\nAemilius Paullus, is neither rash, nor slow, nor timid, but both energetic and\nquite thorough. Livy\u2019s narrative stresses Paullus\u2019 careful attention to\nlogistics, scouting, sentries and communications. At the same time, Paullus\ndoes not delay; in his own accounting he takes just fifteen days to complete\nthe campaign (Livy 45.41.4; App. Mac. 19). Paullus is in a hurry. And of\ncourse, he has to be: he is going to have the same logistics problems\noperating here that his predecessors did. Every day has to count.\n\nPaullus first sends scouts to figure out where Perseus is, and on getting news\nof his fortified camp on the Elpeus, Paullus moves up and camps opposite it.\nPaullus considers both a frontal attack and an attempt to use the Roman fleet\nto essentially flank Perseus, but dismisses both: the camp was too fortified\nfor a frontal attack and Paullus perhaps correctly guessed that Perseus\nalready had forces in Thessaloniki to forestall any such use of naval power.\nInstead, Paullus decides on a clever plan: he\u2019ll dispatch one of his military\ntribunes, Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum (not that Scipio Nasica,\nbut his father) with a small force to head back, through Heracleum, where\nthey\u2019d be resupplied by the Roman navy, then loop back around through the\nPerrhaebia (taking a route past Lake Ascuris) and up through the Petra pass,\ndropping into the plains of Pieria behind Perseus\u2019 fortified position.\nNasica\u2019s march is brisk; he\u2019s supplied with ten days of cooked rations (cocta\nciberia; probably bucellatum, Roman hard tack). As a result, he can presumably\nleave all of the cooking supplies behind and march fast and light with just\nrations and equipment.^6\n\nThe plan works: Nasica drops into the plain behind Perseus, able to threaten\nhis line of supply. Perseus\u2019 army, which we\u2019ll tally in a moment, was almost\ncertainly too large to supply fully locally. Consequently, Perseus instead\nfalls back along his supply lines back, setting the stage for a decisive\nengagement at the last bottleneck: Pydna.\n\n## Pydna\n\nAnd at long last, we come to it: the last great clash between a Hellenistic\narmy and a Roman one. Our sources for this battle are somewhat difficult. On\nthe one hand, we would prefer Livy, but we\u2019re reaching the ragged edge of the\nLivy we have; books 43 (171-169), 44 (169-168) and 45 (168-166) of his Ab Urbe\nCondita start to have gaps, before the whole thing breaks off with finality.\nUnfortunately, one of those gaps is a chunky lacuna in book 44 that covers the\nearly stages of the battle. On the other hand, we have Plutarch, whose\nbiography of Lucius Aemilius Paullus includes a much shorter narrative of the\nbattle with no breaks. Both authors are relying substantially on Polybius\n(lost to us), as well as an account written by Scipio Nasica.\n\nFortunately for me, Paul Johstono and Michael Taylor recently went through the\ntrouble of untangling the sources for the battle in light of the terrain of\nthe battlefield in an article for Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies (GRBS, a\nmajor journal) that is gloriously open-access, \u201cReconstructing the Battle of\nPydna\u201d (2022). So my narrative follows their reconstruction, which I think is\nsound.\n\nPaullus\u2019 army is somewhat large if relatively normal Roman force. He has two\nlegions as normal, but both are larger than usual, 6,000 men rather than the\ntypical 4,200 (Livy 44.21.8). The socii wings (alae) were probably around\n5,000 strong. We know Paullus has 600 Roman cavalry and presumably some larger\nnumber of socii cavalry; Johstono and Taylor guess around 900, which would be\nfairly typical). Of the socii, we know that a cohort of Paeligni (a people\nfrom what is today Abruzzo in Italy) was part of the army, probably among the\nextraordinarii and they\u2019ll have a key role in the battle. Quake with fear, for\na Paelignian officer has brought a flag.^7\n\nPaullus also has a grab-bag of allies and auxiliaries. Plutarch mentions 700\nLigurian auxiliaries (Aem. 18.2), which are presumably what remained of the\n2,000 recruited in 171 (Livy 42.35.6; these guys are skirmishers and the\nRomans have been taking nasty losses so far in skirmishes, so this isn\u2019t\nshocking). After the embarrassment at Callinicus, the Romans were reinforced\nwith allies from Africa: 1,000 each of Numidian cavalry and infantry, along\nwith 22 elephants; apart from the elephants, it is unclear what of that force\nremains by Pydna. We also have the troops from Pergamum, initially 5,000 of\nthem (4,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry) and Attalus is present with the army, so\npresumably some number of these fellows are still there, but we get no exact\ncount. Likewise, no exact count of Greek allies, but there were almost\ncertainly some. Finally, we are told some 600 Gallic cavalry auxiliaries had\nbeen sent earlier (Livy 42.21.6), but we have no idea if they arrived.\nJohstono and Taylor figure perhaps 35,000 men total and that seems about\nright. In the event, the cavalry and special troops won\u2019t play a huge role in\nthe battle, so a precise account of them isn\u2019t strictly necessary.\n\nPlutarch reports Perseus\u2019 army as four thousand cavalry and just short of\n40,000 infantry, which Plutarch presents as being basically all of the phalanx\n(Plut. Aem. 13.4), but we know the core Macedonian phalanx wasn\u2019t that large\nand that some of these fellows were rather more lightly equipped. Notably, a\nreport to the Senate earlier in 168 had put Perseus\u2019 strength at only 30,000\nmen (Livy 44.20.4), so it isn\u2019t clear if Perseus had reinforced since then or\nsomeone is in error. Perseus\u2019 army clearly included the core Macedonian\nphalanx, but also Thracian auxiliaries, Paeonians, Greek mercenaries, and so\non. In either case, our sources are clear Perseus has the somewhat larger army\n(Livy 44.38.5; Plut. Aem. 16.6), though some of Perseus\u2019 troops may still have\nbeen detached guarding the coast or passes. In the event, the armies were of\ncomparable size.\n\nPerseus fell back to a blocking position at Pydna, encamped on some convenient\nhills at a point where the plain narrows, framed by marsh on one side and\nhills on the other, allowing a tight, flat battlespace in the center ideal for\nhis phalanx. Paullus arrives late in the day after marching and forms up a\nbattle line, probably in the wider section of the plain (Plut. Aem. 17.1-6),\nbut when Perseus doesn\u2019t come out and Paullus refuses the entreaties of his\nyounger officers to rashly attack on unfavorable ground, Paullus carefully\npeals his maniples off one by one to construct the standard Roman fortified\ncamp for the night.\n\nAnd that night, we get an endearing little Roman episode; Paullus evidently\nknew (Plut. Aem. 17.9) that there was going to be an lunar eclipse that night\n\u2013 the ancients were pretty good at estimating the timed occurrences of stellar\nphenomenon even when they didn\u2019t know why they happened (and Plutarch actually\ndoes know that the moon is passing through the shadow of the earth). Paullus\nhas Gaius Sulpicius Gallus, one of his military tribunes, explain to his\nsoldiers what an eclipse is and that these things are predictable, natural\nphenomenon (Livy 44.37.5-9), but then just to be sure, observes the\ntraditional Roman rituals anyway: the Romans would bang pots and make loud\nnoises to call back the goddess Luna and her favor (Plut. Aem. 17.8). The\nRomans banged their pots, Paullus sacrificed to the moon (Plut. Aem. 17.10)\nand Luna graciously returned.\n\nThe mood in the Macedonian camp was less positive: lunar eclipses were thought\nto signal the fall of kings and there was only one king on this battlefield.^8\n\nInstead of a planned engagement, the battle was triggered by a skirmish\nbetween foraging parties going for water which then spiraled into a major\nbattle. These sort of scouting and foraging parties were fairly typical for\nancient armies, as we\u2019ve discussed. In this case, the terrain plays a role, as\nthe primary water source, the Agios Georgios stream, sat between the two\narmies and so made a natural point of contention for these light scouting\nforces. Plutarch notes reports that Aemilius Paullus planned to precipitate a\nbattle this way, but given that Paullus is pretty clearly caught somewhat off-\nguard as the battle begins, one doubts it (Plut. Aem. 18.1, Livy 44.2-3). In\nany case, the aforementioned 700 Ligurians, covering a watering party ended up\nin a skirmish with some Thracian troops, possibly over a loose horse and the\nbattle expanded from there, with Scipio Nasica evidently riding forward to try\nto observe the Macedonian advance and coordinate (Plut. Aem. 18.5).\n\nThe battle erupted quite suddenly; neither the consul nor the king had time to\nget their armor (19.3 and 19.7-10), which leads to a battle where units are\ncoming into combat as quickly as they can be moved out of camp and drawn up.\nWe\u2019ve actually already discussed the difficulties of command, information and\nsight-lines in this specific battle before, so I won\u2019t dwell on them here.\nBoth armies seem to have tried to deploy in a more or less standard battle\narray, with units on the right side (from the Roman perspective) coming into\ncontact first. Notably, both sides also lead with infantry, with the cavalry\ndoing effectively nothing in the battle. This is going to be an engagement\ndecided by a direct, head-on clash of heavy infantry.\n\nAs Paullus is getting his legions out of his camp, the Macedonian army\nlikewise moves out, with the Thracian mercenaries in the lead, followed by the\nmixed Greek and Paeonians, and then the Macedonian elite peltasts and the\nAgema, followed by the cream of the main Macedonian phalanx, the chalkaspides,\n\u2018bronze shields,\u2019 moving in a line to form the left flank of the Macedonian\narmy. Paullus\u2019 first legion \u2013 commanded directly by Paullus himself \u2013 forms up\nopposite of the chalkaspides, with his right wing covered by the camp guard\n(the praesidium) of picked socii cohorts and the rest of the dextra ala (the\nright wing of the socii) forming up to his right.\n\nThis is a very basic diagram of where the major units are in the battle, but\ndo see Johstono and Taylor (2022) \u2013 it\u2019s open access! \u2013 for much more detailed\nmaps that place the units on the actual terrain at their estimated widths and\ndepths.\n\nThe action proper then starts with the agema, leading out, slams into the\ntroops of the praesidium, in particular a cohort of the Paeligni (Romans are\nstill mostly in maniples in 168, but the socii have been in cohorts for some\ntime, see M.J. Taylor, \u201cTactical Reform in the Late Roman Republic: The View\nfrom Italy\u201d Historia 68 (2019)). The Paelignian officer, doing what the\nPaeligni do best, rallies his troops by seizing their cohort\u2019s standard and\nflinging it into the mass of the Macedonians, so that his troops, to avoid the\nshame of losing their standard, would push forward (Livy 44.40.7-8). Believe\nit or not, this is not the only flag-throwing Paelignian praefectus either,\nthis happened before (Livy 25.14.4). So let me offer my advice: if a\nPaelignian officer throws a flag, banner or other kind of standard at you, run\nand do not look back.\n\nThe Paelignians are clearly hard-pressed, but Paullus seems to have judged,\ncorrectly, that they\u2019d keep the agema occupied; the Paelignians, outnumbered\nand facing the best of the Antigonid\u2019s troops fall back and the agema\nevidently follows them, leaving the chalkaspides isolated for a head-on-head\nclash with Paullus\u2019 first legion. Meanwhile, the second half of the phalanx,\nthe less impressive equipped leukaspides, \u2018white shields\u2019 (who are, contra\nSekunda, sarisa-phalanx troops, not thureophoroi) form up to the right of the\nchalkaspides and thus opposite of Paullus\u2019 second legion, which is bring\ndriven forward by Lucius Postumius Albinus.\n\nMeanwhile, the Roman dextra ala (right wing of socii), with the Roman war\nelephants comes into contact with the Macedonian left, composed of the mixed\nPaeonians and Greeks, along with the Thracians. Perseus apparently had a\nspecialized anti-elephant corps prepared for this moment but these fellows\nfail with some intensity, leading Livy to dryly remark, \u201cFor just as many new\ndevices of mortal men have strength in words, but put to the test, when they\nmust function, not just have their function explained, they vanish without any\neffect, so to it was with the elephant-fighters: they were a name without a\nuse\u201d (Livy 44.41.4; and who says Livy is a boring prose stylist!). The dextra\nala follows this up and pushes back the Macedonian left, but are still\nfighting it as the battle continues.\n\nMeanwhile Legio I and the chalkaspides seem to have come into contact next and\nthe legion is initially pushed back (Plut. Aem. 20.1-6). We know from a\nfragment of Polybius that Paullus was terrified at the onset of the\nchalkaspides, so things were evidently not going well (Polyb. 29.17). What\nhappens next is decisive; Livy in his fragmented narrative presents this as a\nsomewhat natural result: the Romans attack catervatim, \u201cby companies or\ntroops\u201d (that is, in smaller units, probably maniples) and in so doing,\ndisrupt the phalanx, as opposed to the Paeligni, who advanced as a single line\nand got beaten back for their efforts (Livy 44.41.7-9). Plutarch presents this\nas a command decision by Paullus, to engage in \u201cnot a single battle, but many\nseparate, successive battles\u201d (Plut. Aem. 20.8), especially an order for each\nmaniple to advance or retreat \u201cin their own time\u201d as it were. As a result, the\nRoman heavy infantry started to get inside the pikes of the chalkaspides.\n\nAnd here we can imagine what comes next, thinking about the tactical and\nequipment advantages the Romans have. The Romans have a bigger shield (the\nscutum) and heavier armor, along with a somewhat longer multi-purpose sword\n(the gladius Hispaniensis) and a fighting style designed for one-on-one\ncombats (in formation, of course). Their Macedonian opponents, while being\n(Polybius notes this), some of the best soldiers in the Mediterranean, are\ntrained for pike tactics in groups, relatively densely formed (with less space\nfor swordplay) and while still heavy infantry, they lack the heavier Roman\narmor, particularly the mail lorica hamata. Worse yet, the close-combat\nweapons they do have, the xiphos straight-sword and kopis forward-curving\nsword, are both of limited use against the mail armor the Romans have.^9\nClearly, the Roman is going to have the \u2018edge\u2019 in that fight and indeed, given\nwhat we\u2019re told about the length of the battle and the casualties, the phalanx\ncrumbles with remarkable speed in a fairly lopsided slaughter.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Roman left, Legio II hits the leukaspides, perhaps before\nthey were fully formed up, leading to its swift collapse, at which point the\nwhole Macedonian army effectively falls apart (after all, both its left wing\nand both elements of the phalanx are now collapsing by this point). The whole\nbattle evidently occurred quite quickly, despite its fierceness, with Plutarch\nnoting the battle took less than an hour (Plut. Aem. 22.1).\n\nPerseus \u2013 wait for it \u2013 panics and flees (Plut. Aem. 23.1-2; Livy 44.42.2-3).\nHe seems to have been formed up with his cavalry, in proper Macedonian\nfashion, waiting for the moment when the powerful Macedonian cavalry could be\nused to hammer a key gap or weak point. In the event, he never saw his\nopening. The agema\u2018s successful initial engagement ought to have created such\na gap, but it is possible that in the rolling terrain, Perseus could not see\nit. On the other hand, Perseus gets a reputation in the sources (particularly\nLivy) as being something of a vacillating coward, so it is possible he simply\nlost his nerve again. I don\u2019t think it would have mattered, with the Romans\nrelatively quickly winning over essentially the entire field.\n\nThe Romans then pursued and butchered the Macedonian phalanx, to staggering\ncasualties. Plutarch reports some 25,000 Macedonian dead (Plut. Aem. 21.7),\nwhereas Livy more carefully reports 20,000 KIA, with another 11,000 prisoners\n(Livy 44.42.7); both are probably exaggerations, but it is clear Macedonian\nlosses were devastating. Roman losses, by contrast, were very light; Plutarch\nsays Nasica reported 80 losses, an otherwise unknown Poseidonius 100; Livy\nreports, \u201cnot more than one hundred died of the victors, and of these the\nmajor part was the Paeligni; many more were wounded\u201d (Livy 44.42.8). The\nreport that many Romans were wounded but few killed is striking and I suspect\na testament to the relative effectiveness of Roman body armor in the close-in\nfighting as the phalanx collapsed: effective armor doesn\u2019t negate wounds, but\nit turns debilitating or lethal piercing and cutting wounds into survivable\nblunt trauma wounds or shallow cuts.\n\n## Why Roman Victory in the Third Macedonian War?\n\nThe lopsided Roman victory at Pydna effectively ended the Third Macedonian War\nand the Antigonid dynasty and the Macedonian state. Perseus fled, but there\nwas no chance of mounting real resistance anymore; Plutarch reports that even\nPerseus\u2019 cavalry bodyguard took the chance to melt away into the countryside\n(Plut. Aem. 23.1-9). Perseus was eventually captured and taken back to Rome to\nfeature in Aemilius Paullus\u2019 triumph. The Romans seized the Macedonian\ntreasury, which was brought back to Rome and displayed in the same triumph,\nwith Polybius reporting it amounted to some six thousand talents and Livy that\nit was 120 million sesterces (Polyb. 18.35.3, Livy 45.40.1, note also Plut.\nAem. 33.2-24 and Diod. Sic. 33.8; all of the figures given, as Taylor notes in\nSoldiers and Silver (2020), 149 come out to around the same figure of c. 30\nmillion drachma).\n\nWe\u2019ll have a seperate post next week, an \u2018epilogue,\u2019 as it were, discussing\nthe broader impacts of Roman victory here, but instead I want to close this\npost by focusing on why the Romans won.\n\nThe first thing that I think is quite clear here, especially as we\u2019ve now\nlooked at all four of the big second century Legion-v-Phalanx battles, is that\nthe Roman legion simply has a tactical edge against Hellenistic armies.\nPolybius, of course, famously notes as much, though scholars are often\nsomewhat skeptical of his schematic explanation (Polyb. 18.28-32). While the\npopular conception focuses a lot on rough ground (often imagining very rough\nground like forests and mountains), the three pitched engagements\n(Cynoscephalae, Magnesia and Pydna) occur on ground that, while certainly not\nflat in all cases, isn\u2019t extremely rough, nor is it clear that the roughness\nof the ground was purely decisive in any case.\n\nInstead, both Cynoscephalae and Pydna come down to the flexibility of maniples\nas independent maneuvering units, with the Romans in the first battle able to\nredeploy maniples to exploit a gap and in the second to advance maniples\nseperately to create gaps. Meanwhile at Magnesia, the Roman left was able to\nengage in a fighting withdrawal in situations were we might expect its\nformation to crumble, seemingly also because of the relatively flexible\nmanueverability of Roman maniples.\n\nThat flexibility becomes decisive because of what I\u2019d argue is a real Roman\nequipment advantage, which isn\u2019t really a technological advantage, per se. The\nonly new technology the Romans are using is mail armor, which, to be fair, is\nvery good and I think quite impactful. But if Roman and Hellenistic iron-\nworking or production methods differ, we can\u2019t see it. Instead, it isn\u2019t a\ntechnological advantage, but a mismatch that gives the Romans the edge. Roman\nheavy infantry are heavily armored for the attritional, close-combat the\nlegion is built around, by contrast, Macedonian phalangites, while still heavy\ninfantry, were less well protected, because they were supposed to have those\nlong sarisae between them and the enemy and in any case were a pinning force,\nnot a killing force.\n\nConsequently, once the Romans disrupt the Macedonian formation and the\nfighting becomes more fluid, the Roman equipment set, designed to produce\ncasualties and avoid taking casualties, is in its element, whereas the key\npinning element of the Macedonian phalanx, the sarisa, is suddenly useless. We\ncannot know, but I suspect equipment followed training here and that\nMacedonian soldiers who found themselves in that killing-fight rather than a\npinning-fight were aware they had strayed outside of what they had trained\nfor, which probably had catastrophic implications for morale and cohesion.\n\nBeyond this tactical edge, Aemilius Paullus is also just clearly a better\ngeneral than Perseus. In a surprise battle that neither anticipated, Perseus\nfirst vaciliates and then panics (again), while Paullus keeps his head, keeps\nhis legion and wins his battle. And that comes after fifteen days of bold,\ndecisive but well-planned and not-at-all-reckless movement from Paullus, who\nmoves with an urgency his predecessors lacked. Even Paullus\u2019 management of the\neclipse shows a general more in tune with the morale of his men and more\nactive. That said, we should be careful: it\u2019s clear that both Livy and\nPlutarch understand Perseus as something of an archetype of a bad king,\ncowardly, greedy, self-serving and narcissistic, and they may be constructing\nthat archetype to moralize a bit. Still, that Perseus was solidly out-\ngeneraled is not hard to establish.\n\nFinally, moving up the levels of analysis, Roman command of the sea remains\ncrucial for getting Roman armies to the area of combat and \u2013 once you have a\ngeneral like Paullus who can coordinate it \u2013 keeping them supplied there.\nMoreover, Roman command of the sea is important because it forces Perseus on\nthe defensive, giving him essentially no true offensive options, though the\nAntigonid kingdom hardly had the force necessary to invade Italy in any event.\n\nMore broadly, I think Perseus\u2019 defensive, exhaustion-strategy was effectively\ndoomed from the beginning. Rome deployed 10 legions in 176, 7 in each year\nfrom 175-173, 6 in 172, 10 in 171 and 170, 8 in 169, and 10 again in 168, with\nsome of them over-strength that year.^10 In short, Rome maintained deployments\nof about double Perseus\u2019 maximum, all-effort deployment at effectively all\ntimes. The Romans could wage Perseus\u2019 war of logistics and exhaustion forever,\nrolling the dice every year until they turned up a commander who could\noutmaneuver Perseus\u2019 army into a decisive battle. Perseus had to win all of\nthe battles; the Romans merely needed to win one of them.\n\nThe difference in military power wasn\u2019t a pure product of demographics. The\nAntigonid kingdom had plenty of people. But mobilizing armies is more complex\nthan merely finding warm bodies. Often to be soldiers those men need to be of\nthe right ethnic group, the right social class, or have enough wealth to buy\nequipment. Alternately the king must pay them. In any case, raising fresh\narmies takes time, which Perseus did not have after Pydna, though I doubt he\nhad many fresh troops to raise. Mobilizing ancient armies was, instead, a\ncomplex product of harnessing resources, labor, men and money in the context\nof societies with extremely low productivity and low labor specialization\n(when what you need is lots of specialized labor). For reasons that\nessentially summarize to, \u201cread my book project when it is done\u201d the Romans\nhad built the more effective machine for turning farms into weapons and\nfarmers into soldiers, wildly more effective than any other similar system in\nthe Mediterranean (only Carthage comes remotely close).\n\nAnd that larger resource pool, combined with the Roman Republic\u2019s political\nsystem and its abilityto furnish a seemingly endless supply of \u2018good enough\u2019\nworkmanlike generals and strong strategic direction from the Senate meant that\ndespite Rome not being obviously larger or richer or more urbanized or more\nsophisticated or more advanced than the Hellenistic states, none of Rome\u2019s\nwars in the East were particularly close. Indeed, as Polybius notes, \u201cthe\nprogress of the Romans, from the beginning, was not due to chance, nor was it\nautomatic, as some among the Greeks chose to believe\u201d (Polyb. 1.63.9).\n\nAnd that is how you beat a Macedonian sarisa-phalanx.\n\nRomans!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n  1.

If you don\u2019t want to have it captured, you\u2019ll have to follow me!\u201d.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  6. AiryW says:\n\nApril 26, 2024 at 9:11 pm\n\nIt seems like the pike phalanx is really bad at actually inflicting casaulties\nin pitched battle. We\u2019ve got this reoccuring occurance of the Romans getting\npushed back in good order with surprisingly low losses. It\u2019s not like we dont\nhave plenty of examples of Romans breaking in battle and/or taking heavy\nlosses but these elite heavy infantry repeatedly fail to do either.\n\nThe phalanx (pike and otherwise) seems optimized around the asumption that if\nyou dislodge the enemy they are routed and disordered and you will inflict\ndisprorportionate losses. If that assumption doesn\u2019t hold then suddenly the\npike phalanx becomes a white elephant. You\u2019ve focused all your best infantry\nresources into a formation that is optimized at a task that doesn\u2019t actually\nmatter. Sure the pike phalanx will dislodge the legions but if it neither\nkills nor routes them all that means is they get to repeat the process a few\nhundred yards later.\n\nIt makes me wonder if the secret sauce for Pyrrhus was actually that he was\nthe only Greek king who was recruiting in Italy. Having Samnites articulating\nyour phalanx isn\u2019t just protecting the flanks, it\u2019s putting troops there who\nare ready and willing to keep the pressure on the withdrawing romans. Medium\ninfantry just wouldn\u2019t be up to that role later on when the social status of\nthe medium infantry was lower and the armor of the Romans was heavier.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n    1. Nate T says:\n\nApril 26, 2024 at 9:49 pm\n\nThe sarissa phalanx isn\u2019t supposed to kill enemies. That not its job; its job\nis to pin enemy infantry formations down. What did the killing was the cavalry\n(and later elephantry), which is why the king stayed with them. The problem is\nthat these can\u2019t kill troops in good order and the Roman system ensures that\neven if the first two lines collapse, there\u2019s always another line to fall back\nto and give those soldiers time to reform. What\u2019s more the Roman system is\nshot through with senior officers whose whole job is to lead and rally a small\nportion of the army \u2014 which again, provides enough of a backstop and speed\nbump for the rest of the army to get away, draw up, reform, and get back into\nthe fight.\n\nBy contrast the killing power of the Roman legions is in the infantry. Once\nthe infantry can get to close grips (meaning inside the reach of a pike) they\nare trained and equipped to do the killing all themselves, not merely to pin\nthe enemy down and wait for cavalry to arrive and finish the enemy off.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  7. Demarquis says:\n\nApril 26, 2024 at 9:30 pm\n\nSo, in the end, the Romans weren\u2019t so much more powerful than their enemies,\nbut more efficient, better trained, and better led.\n\nWhich, I suppose, is a type of power all its\u2019 own.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n    1. Nate T says:\n\nApril 26, 2024 at 9:50 pm\n\nThe Romans also had more armies, or rather were better at leveraging their\nexisting populace to fight for them than their enemies are. \u201cHaving more\nsoldiers\u201d is pretty powerful all on its own.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n      1.

Moon Moth says:\n\nApril 26, 2024 at 10:42 pm\n\nThat last map, the one you captioned \u201cVia Wikipedia, a map of the region\u201d, was\nmuch easier for me to read than the others, with respect to understanding the\nterrain. I know, we\u2019re lucky to get maps and visual aids at all, and thank\nyou. It\u2019s not always easy to find good maps. But I thought I\u2019d register a\npreference, in case it ever matters. (I\u2019m guessing it depends a bit on whether\nother people chime in, and whether they agree.)\n\nIt does seem like rotating through commanders was a Roman strength. It reminds\nme of Monty Python: \u201cthe fourth one stayed up!\u201d Whereas the Hellenistic armies\nwere stuck with their king, however good or bad he turned out to be.\n\nSo, the whole war took 3-4 years. I presume that, even though the commanders\nrotated, the legionaries stayed in the field. With all the talk of harvests in\nthe comments of the last post, this makes me wonder: if they were farmers,\nwhat was happening to their farms? Wives could take over administration, and\nhired or enslaved workers wouldn\u2019t be affected, but if the legionary had\nanything physical to do, wouldn\u2019t this disrupt the farm work? Were the farms\nrun by a nuclear family or an extended family? My understanding (although it\u2019s\nbeen a long time) is that when classical Greek poleis went to war, there was a\nrough \u201ccampaigning season\u201d during which the men of a polis would go out and\nfight someone, which was a time when agricultural labor wasn\u2019t necessary.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nUpdates every Friday!\n\nYou can support this project via Patreon, and by spreading the word!\n\n# Recent Posts\n\n  * Collections: Phalanx\u2019s Twilight, Legion\u2019s Triumph, Part IVc: Perseus\n  * Gap Week: April 19, 2024 (Manor Lords First Impression)\n  * Fireside Friday, April 12, 2024\n  * Collections: Phalanx\u2019s Twilight, Legion\u2019s Triumph, Part IVb: Antiochus III\n  * Fireside Friday, March 29, 2024 (On Roman Values)\n  * Fireside Friday, March 22, 2024\n\n# Questions?
