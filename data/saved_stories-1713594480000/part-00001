Dennett\n\nThe Atlantic / Getty\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nListen to this article\n\n00:00\n\n06:50\n\nListen to more stories on hark\n\nMoney has existed for several thousand years, and from the outset\ncounterfeiting was recognized to be a very serious crime, one that in many\ncases calls for capital punishment because it undermines the trust on which\nsociety depends. Today, for the first time in history, thanks to artificial\nintelligence, it is possible for anybody to make counterfeit people who can\npass for real in many of the new digital environments we have created. These\ncounterfeit people are the most dangerous artifacts in human history, capable\nof destroying not just economies but human freedom itself. Before it\u2019s too\nlate (it may well be too late already) we must outlaw both the creation of\ncounterfeit people and the \u201cpassing along\u201d of counterfeit people. The\npenalties for either offense should be extremely severe, given that\ncivilization itself is at risk.\n\nIt is a terrible irony that the current infatuation with fooling people into\nthinking they are interacting with a real person grew out of Alan Turing\u2019s\ninnocent proposal in 1950 to use what he called \u201cthe imitation game\u201d (now\nknown as the Turing Test) as the benchmark of real thinking. This has\nengendered not just a cottage industry but a munificently funded high-tech\nindustry engaged in making products that will trick even the most skeptical of\ninterlocutors. Our natural inclination to treat anything that seems to talk\nsensibly with us as a person\u2014adopting what I have called the \u201cintentional\nstance\u201d\u2014turns out to be easy to invoke and almost impossible to resist, even\nfor experts. We\u2019re all going to be sitting ducks in the immediate future.\n\nThe philosopher and historian Yuval Noah Harari, writing in The Economist in\nApril, ended his timely warning about AI\u2019s imminent threat to human\ncivilization with these words:\n\n\u201cThis text has been generated by a human. Or has it?\u201d\n\nIt will soon be next to impossible to tell. And even if (for the time being)\nwe are able to teach one another reliable methods of exposing counterfeit\npeople, the cost of such deepfakes to human trust will be enormous. How will\nyou respond to having your friends and family probe you with gotcha questions\nevery time you try to converse with them online?\n\nCreating counterfeit digital people risks destroying our civilization.\nDemocracy depends on the informed (not misinformed) consent of the governed.\nBy allowing the most economically and politically powerful people,\ncorporations, and governments to control our attention, these systems will\ncontrol us. Counterfeit people, by distracting and confusing us and by\nexploiting our most irresistible fears and anxieties, will lead us into\ntemptation and, from there, into acquiescing to our own subjugation. The\ncounterfeit people will talk us into adopting policies and convictions that\nwill make us vulnerable to still more manipulation. Or we will simply turn off\nour attention and become passive and ignorant pawns. This is a terrifying\nprospect.\n\nThe key design innovation in the technology that makes losing control of these\nsystems a real possibility is that, unlike nuclear bombs, these weapons can\nreproduce. Evolution is not restricted to living organisms, as Richard Dawkins\ndemonstrated in 1976 in The Selfish Gene. Counterfeit people are already\nbeginning to manipulate us into midwiving their progeny. They will learn from\none another, and those that are the smartest, the fittest, will not just\nsurvive; they will multiply. The population explosion of brooms in The\nSorcerer\u2019s Apprentice has begun, and we had better hope there is a non-magical\nway of shutting it down.\n\nThere may be a way of at least postponing and possibly even extinguishing this\nominous development, borrowing from the success\u2014limited but impressive\u2014in\nkeeping counterfeit money merely in the nuisance category for most of us (or\ndo you carefully examine every $20 bill you receive?).\n\nAs Harari says, we must \u201cmake it mandatory for AI to disclose that it is an\nAI.\u201d How could we do that? By adopting a high-tech \u201cwatermark\u201d system like the\nEURion Constellation, which now protects most of the world\u2019s currencies. The\nsystem, though not foolproof, is exceedingly difficult and costly to\noverpower\u2014not worth the effort, for almost all agents, even governments.\nComputer scientists similarly have the capacity to create almost indelible\npatterns that will scream FAKE! under almost all conditions\u2014so long as the\nmanufacturers of cellphones, computers, digital TVs, and other devices\ncooperate by installing the software that will interrupt any fake messages\nwith a warning. Some computer scientists are already working on such measures,\nbut unless we act swiftly, they will arrive too late to save us from drowning\nin the flood of counterfeits.\n\nDid you know that the manufacturers of scanners have already installed\nsoftware that responds to the EURion Constellation (or other watermarks) by\ninterrupting any attempt to scan or photocopy legal currency? Creating new\nlaws along these lines will require cooperation from the major participants,\nbut they can be incentivized. Bad actors can expect to face horrific penalties\nif they get caught either disabling watermarks or passing on the products of\nthe technology that have already been stripped somehow of their watermarks. AI\ncompanies (Google, OpenAI, and others) that create software with these\ncounterfeiting capabilities should be held liable for any misuse of the\nproducts (and of the products of their products\u2014remember, these systems can\nevolve on their own). That will keep companies that create or use AI\u2014and their\nliability-insurance underwriters\u2014very aggressive in making sure that people\ncan easily tell when conversing with one of their AI products.\n\nI\u2019m not in favor of capital punishment for any crime, but it would be\nreassuring to know that major executives, as well as their technicians, were\nin jeopardy of spending the rest of their life in prison in addition to paying\nbillions in restitution for any violations or any harms done. And strict\nliability laws, removing the need to prove either negligence or evil intent,\nwould keep them on their toes. The economic rewards of AI are great, and the\nprice of sharing in them should be taking on the risk of both condemnation and\nbankruptcy for failing to meet ethical obligations for its use.\n\nIt will be difficult\u2014maybe impossible\u2014to clean up the pollution of our media\nof communication that has already occurred, thanks to the arms race of\nalgorithms that is spreading infection at an alarming rate. Another pandemic\nis coming, this time attacking the fragile control systems in our\nbrains\u2014namely, our capacity to reason with one another\u2014that we have used so\neffectively to keep ourselves relatively safe in recent centuries.\n\nThe moment has arrived to insist on making anybody who even thinks of\ncounterfeiting people feel ashamed\u2014and duly deterred from committing such an\nantisocial act of vandalism. If we spread the word now that such acts will be\nagainst the law as soon as we can arrange it, people will have no excuse for\npersisting in their activities. Many in the AI community these days are so\neager to explore their new powers that they have lost track of their moral\nobligations. We should remind them, as rudely as is necessary, that they are\nrisking the future freedom of their loved ones, and of all the rest of us.\n\nDaniel C. Dennett is a professor emeritus of philosophy at Tufts University.\nHe is the author of many books including Consciousness Explained, Darwin's\nDangerous Idea, and From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
