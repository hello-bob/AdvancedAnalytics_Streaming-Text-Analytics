Currently, a small team is building the platform:\nfour full-time on product, engineering, editorial and operations, and one\npart-time exploring special projects. The company that builds Are.na is\nindependent and sustained entirely by our members.\n\nOur only business is to make Are.na an experience that is worth paying for.\nThe people who use it are our only customers. 15,099 people support Are.na\nthrough their Premium subscriptions.\n\n### The Secret\n\n#### Allow yourself to go down rabbit holes\n\nA rabbit hole is not a distraction. A rabbit hole is your brain trying to tell\nyou to pay attention to something you\u2019re curious about. Ignore algorithmic\nrabbit holes.\n\n#### If you see something, save something\n\nPay attention to what feels resonant to you. Save breadcrumbs and build a path\nfor yourself to walk down later on. The ability to classify information in a\npersonal way is a muscle worth exercising.\n\n#### \u201cCreativity is just connecting things\u201d\n\nOver time, build contexts for yourself and your ideas. Analyze what happens\nwhen you connect those contexts to someone else\u2019s.\n\n#### Remember\n\nThe goal is not self-improvement. The goal is engaging more deeply with the\nWorld.\n\nTry Are.na\n\nOr learn more in the links below\n\nAbout & FeaturesPricing & Education plansRoadmapEditorialTeamHelp\n\n### Downloads\n\niOS AppAndroid App\n\n### Extended Are.na\n\nBrowser ExtensionsAPICommunity Projects\n\n### Editorial\n\nAre.na EditorialGift ShopAnnual books\n\n### Info\n\nContact & HelpCommunity GuidelinesTermsPrivacyPress\n\n", "frontpage": false}
