Is it waterproof? Ts&Cs say: 'Failure to put Cybertruck in Car\nWash Mode may result in damage'\n\nRichard Currie\n\nSat 20 Apr 2024 // 11:28 UTC\n\nThe perils of turning cars into computers were laid bare by a hapless\nCybertruck owner who claimed his ride was rendered an $80,000 \"paperweight\" by\nsomething as benign as a wash.\n\nNow, we tech-savvy people are well aware that computers and water do not mix.\nBut cars get dirty, and when you've tossed your life savings into a\nCybertruck, you'd probably want to keep it looking immaculate.\n\nAt the same time, we'd hesitate to hose off our motherboard even if the cat\nhair level was approaching critical mass. But when your car is a computer,\nwhat are your options?\n\nAs noted by motoring zine Jalopnik, a TikTok user going by @captian.ad regaled\nhis followers with a tale of how he took his Cybertruck to the beach with his\ndogs.\n\nWhat sounds like a lovely day out soon turned to sorrow, however, as on the\nway back he stopped off at a car wash to rid his luxury whip of sand. For most\ndrivers, this sounds like a perfectly reasonable course of action.\n\nHe then parked up in his garage where the silver monstrosity seemed to breathe\nits last. The screen in the central console, which is absolutely essential to\noperating the Cybertruck because it hosts critical information like speed and\nrear view, went black as pitch and wouldn't respond.\n\nOur hero, probably feeling the same sort of panic one experiences when a\ncomputer dies mid-use, followed the Tesla guidelines for a reboot only to be\nmet by a disconcerting and electrical \"pop.\" Following this reset, he said\nthat the Tesla \"T\" is supposed to come up on the screen and all should be\nwell. That did not happen.\n\nEverything else, including the rear seat screens, appeared to function fine.\nIt's only that driving the Cybertruck without that console would be terribly\nunsafe. The owner lamented that he's \"two and a half months in and 3,400\nmiles\" (5,471 km).\n\nThere is a happier ending, however, as another video explains that he opened a\nservice ticket with Tesla. The following morning, he went to collect some\npossessions from the truck and found that the beast had been roused from its\ndeath-like stupor.\n\nHe also received a call from Tesla to check on him. The advisor said that \"it\nis a known issue in the Cybertruck that when you do a screen reset, instead of\nresetting in the standard two minutes, it takes five hours.\"\n\nSo when he had initiated that hard reset before, it had taken half the night\nto go through. That's another issue with computers that, once upon a time,\ndidn't trouble cars \u2013 software bugs. The fault was registered as a complaint\nand \"hopefully it gets addressed in a future software patch,\" the owner said.\n\n  * Tesla decimates staff amid ongoing performance woe\n  * Tesla's Cybertruck may not be so stainless after all\n  * Tesla Cybertruck gets cyberstuck during off-roading expedition\n  * Musk floats idea of boat mod for Cybertruck\n\n\"But five hours to reset a computer? And this is new hardware, hardware 4. All\nI wanna know is, where do I get that computer so I can take it to work?\n'Sorry, boss, I'm resetting my computer. I'll get to that in a little bit,'\"\nhe joked.\n\nMeanwhile, the story was also picked up on Tesla CEO Elon Musk's other\nbusiness empire, where an X user plumbed the depths of the Cybertruck owner's\nmanual, which routinely turns up comedy gold.\n\nIn this instance, attention was drawn to a line saying: \"CAUTION Failure to\nput Cybertruck in Car Wash Mode may result in damage (for example, to the\ncharge port or windshield wipers). Damage caused by car washes is not covered\nby the warranty.\"\n\nThe fact that the Cybertruck even has such a mode is, frankly, ludicrous.\nThere was also the perplexing warning: \"Do not wash in direct sunlight.\"\nAnswers on a postcard, please. It is not clear whether the owner heeded either\nof these instructions.\n\nIt puts us in mind of Cybertruck owners reporting rust forming on the car's\nexterior. Despite the commonly held belief that the stainless steel body would\nbe immune to corrosion, Tesla's documentation once again served only to\nhighlight the Cybertruck's weaknesses, such as the lack of a clear coat.\n\n\"To prevent damage to the exterior, immediately remove corrosive substances\n(such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots,\nroad salt, industrial fallout, etc.),\" it says. \"Do not wait until Cybertruck\nis due for a complete wash. If necessary use denatured alcohol to remove tar\nspots and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water\nand a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol.\"\n\nThere's also the owner who took his Cybertruck off-roading, and broke it,\nleaving many wondering what Tesla's latest and greatest can actually do.\n\nMusk once touted the Cybertruck as \"literally bulletproof\" but whether it's\neven waterproof seems open to some debate.\n\nThe billionaire and his controversially shaped truck aren't having the best of\ntime lately. Yesterday's the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nissued recall of the Cybertruck due to fault accelerator pedals, a problem\nthat first emerged earlier in the week. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Tesla\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Tesla\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Autopilot\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Elon Musk\n\n#### More about\n\n17 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Tesla\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Tesla\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Autopilot\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Elon Musk\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Tesla decimates staff amid ongoing performance woe\n\nShares of the worst performing member of the S&P 500 slide some more as news\nunlikely to please investors\n\nPersonal Tech5 days | 85\n\n#### Tesla asks shareholders to reinstate Musk's voided $56B pay package\n\nGiven the electric car maker's annus horribilis so far in 2024, does the chief\neven deserve it?\n\nPersonal Tech3 days | 75\n\n#### Despite two previous court victories, Tesla settles third Autopilot\nliability case\n\nAmount sealed because it would result in 'serious injury,' say company lawyers\n\nAI + ML11 days | 47\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Unintended acceleration leads to recall of every Cybertruck produced so\nfar\n\nThat isn't what Tesla meant by Full Self-Driving\n\nOffbeat1 day | 69\n\n#### Canadian arrested for 'stealing secret' to speedy Tesla battery\nproduction\n\nSpecial tech allegedly lets Musk's assembly lines produce 5-10 times more kit\nthan rivals\n\nPersonal Tech1 month | 57\n\n#### When life gives you Lemon, sack him\n\nComment CNN veteran publishes Musk interview that got his X show canceled\n\nOffbeat1 month | 117\n\n#### Tesla Berlin gigafactory to take week-long nap after suspected arson\n\nLosses could surpass \u20ac1B as 1,000 vehicles a day go unfinished\n\nOffbeat1 month | 9\n\n#### Tesla Berlin gigafactory goes dark after alleged eco-sabotage\n\nLeft-wing extremist group claims responsibility, says goal is to 'bring Tesla\nto its knees'\n\nOffbeat2 months | 54\n\n#### Legal eagles demand $6B in Tesla stock after overturning Musk's mega pay\npackage\n\n'Criminal,' says CEO\n\nOffbeat2 months | 58\n\n#### Elon and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad legal week\n\nWorkers allege discrimination, missing payments\n\nOn-Prem2 months | 65\n\n#### Tesla's Cybertruck may not be so stainless after all\n\n'Literally bulletproof' but needs constant cleaning to stave off corrosion\n\nBootnotes2 months | 212\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
