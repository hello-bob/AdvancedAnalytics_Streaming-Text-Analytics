With our preferred configuration, this is generally a comfortable\nexperience. However, some websites insist on overriding our settings with\ntheir own scrolling behavior \u2014 usually something like a smooth scrolling\neffect.\n\nPlease don\u2019t do this.\n\nI\u2019m no user experience (UX) expert, but my view is that it\u2019s generally\npreferable for every site I visit to respond similarly to my inputs. The home\nand end keys should move the viewport to the top and bottom of the page,\nrespectively. The spacebar should scroll down one \u201cpage\u201d, similar to the page\ndown key. And scrolling should behave as configured through a combination of\noperating system settings and my browser configuration.\n\nNote: This does not apply to unconventional websites, such as Scale of the\nUniverse, or even Google Maps, where such input is repurposed altogether.\n\nIt may seem as though controlling the scrolling behavior within a site helps\nensure a certain experience for the user, but I find that the opposite is\noften true. For example, by combining my preferred settings with the\noverridden scroll behavior of a hypothetical web site, the result is often\nclumsy and difficult to control, causing me to quickly lose interest in\nviewing that page.\n\nIf users want smooth scrolling, they have plenty of options already.\n\n  * Google Chrome\u2019s Smooth Scrolling setting\n\n  * Mozilla Firefox\u2019s general.smoothScroll.* settings (in about:config)\n\n  * \u201cSmoothScroll\u201d extension for Google Chrome\n\n  * \u201cYet Another Smooth Scrolling WE\u201d extension for Mozilla Firefox\n\n### Subscribe to SuperG's Thoughts\n\nLaunched 2 years ago\n\nGames, technology, and anything else I feel like writing about.\n\nShare\n\nPython and the Legend of Zelda\n\nUsing brute force to solve a classic grid-based puzzle.\n\nFeb 1, 2022 \u2022\n\nSuperG\n\nOpinions in an Objective Reality\n\nOpinion-based proclamations about objective truth are invalid.\n\nFeb 28, 2022 \u2022\n\nSuperG\n\nThe \"Not All Scotsman\" Fallacy\n\nYet another tool in the dishonest interlocutor's belt\n\nNov 5, 2022 \u2022\n\nSuperG\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 SuperG\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n", "frontpage": false}
