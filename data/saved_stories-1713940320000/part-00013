Younger investors might\nstart with a higher stock allocation to increase expected returns, and older\ninvestors might dial the stock allocation lower to decrease expected\nvolatility, but either way stocks and bonds represent the two primary\ncomponents of the popular portfolio.\n\nThe idea behind it is straightforward. Stocks outperform over the long run,\nbut can be very volatile, especially during recessions. Meanwhile, bond yields\nusually fall during recessions (meaning bond prices go up), and so bond prices\ntend to go up in the years where stock prices go down. Putting both stocks and\nbonds together results in strong performance but with only mild volatility.\n\nHowever, this concept is based on some really narrow assumptions, with a lot\nof recency bias built in.\n\n-The 60/40 portfolio became popular during a four decade structural decline in interest rates, which directly meant that bond prices were structurally going up. This also indirectly supported ever-higher equity valuations along the way, since the nominally risk-free discount rate kept falling.\n\n-The United States has had the best-performing stock market in the world for the past four decades. The same portfolio concept tried in most other countries would have much weaker results. Many global investors, especially in developing countries, tend to focus more on real estate than equities for this reason.\n\nNow that interest rates are no longer structurally declining, and large\namounts of global capital are already stuffed into U.S. markets (which was not\nthe case four decades ago), the expected rate of return for a 60/40 portfolio\nis likely to be lower for the next forty years. It doesn\u2019t mean that the\nportfolio must do poorly, but it has a high probability of being less\nexceptional.\n\nPlus, the 60/40 portfolio has historically seen disappointing results,\nespecially in real terms, during periods of high inflation.\n\nThe energy and commodity sectors tend to be very cyclical, with huge decade-\nlong ups and downs. During periods of limited supply and high energy/commodity\nprices, plenty of producers deploy capital to bring more supply online, but\neventually overdo it, and result in a supply glut and lower prices. A long\nperiod of low prices drives away capital, and eventually the supply/demand\nbalance tightens and results in another wave of high prices and supply\nlimitations. And then borrowing costs go higher in response to high inflation,\nwhich leads to higher costs of capital for many types of businesses. Higher\nprices eventually entice capital to come back to develop new supply, starting\nthe cycle anew.\n\nDuring those major energy and commodity price bull runs, the 60/40 portfolio\ntends to perform poorly. This included the 1910s, 1940s, the 1970s, and the\n2000s decades. This is because inflation was higher, corporate margins were\npressured, and bonds were either falling in price and/or their yields were\nfailing to keep up with inflation.\n\nHistorically, the way to protect a portfolio against that scenario is to own\nenergy assets, commodity assets, or hard monies, but the 60/40 portfolio lacks\nmuch exposure to them. It\u2019s heavily geared toward disinflation rather than\ninflation.\n\nWaves of Inflation\n\nHere\u2019s a chart of the change in the oil price and official CPI that stretches\nback over a century. It shows the cumulative percent changes over 5-year\nrolling periods, to filter out 1-year noise:\n\nUsually, high oil prices and high inflation go hand-in-hand. All periods of\nhigh inflation during this period had high oil prices. The other direction is\nnot quite as consistent since there was one exception: the 2000s decade had\nhigh oil prices but not-so-high inflation, because that was the peak growth\nperiod of China which brought a big disinflationary wave of low-cost\nmanufacturing to the world and offset a lot of the energy-driven inflation.\n\nAs the oil/inflation chart shows, the notable historical bull runs in energy\nand inflation were the 1910s, 1940s, 1970s, and 2000s.\n\nNot surprisingly, large cap equity growth indices did poorly during those four\nperiods of 1910s, 1940s, 1970s, and 2000s. This was always the case in\ninflation-adjusted terms, and usually the case in nominal terms as well.\n\nChart Source: Multpl\n\nSo a 60/40 portfolio historically offers little protection against waves of\ninflation driven by energy/commodity capex cycles and related issues. It is\npurely geared toward the expectation of structural disinflation.\n\nAnd part of this is because the equity component in a 60/40 portfolio is\nusually weighted by market capitalization. After a couple decades of\ndisinflation, the stocks that make up the majority of the index are big\ngrowth-oriented consumer or tech companies at high valuations, while energy\nand commodity companies are diminished to a tiny percentage of the index after\na long bear market in them. At the start of the next energy/commodity bull\nmarket is precisely when investors have the least exposure to energy and\ncommodity companies as a percentage of their portfolio.\n\nBonds and Growth\n\nMany people benchmark bonds against official measures of price inflation, but\nthere are other measures that are better. This is because as an investor, you\ndon\u2019t just want to keep up with prices; you want to keep up your share of\ntotal economic output and asset prices.\n\nIf we compare bond yields to GDP growth, for example, there are structural\nperiods where GDP growth is completely outpacing bond yields (the yellow areas\nin the chart below), and historically during those periods it\u2019s way better to\nown almost anything else than bonds. Conversely, there are periods where bond\nyields are nearly as high or even higher than GDP growth, and so owning bonds\nis actually not a bad trade.\n\nThe secular rise in bond yields from the 1950s through the 1970s was a bad\ntime to own long duration bonds compared to almost anything else. In contrast,\nlong duration bonds did pretty well from the 1980s through the 2000s,\nespecially compared to cash, and that\u2019s when the 60/40 stock/bond portfolio\nbecame popular.\n\nIf we enter a structurally flat or structurally upward period in bond yields\nfrom low levels, then bonds are unlikely to be the portfolio ballast that they\nhistorically have been.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that bonds won\u2019t have good years. I expect that they will,\nand I expect that we\u2019ll see headlines about how \u201cthe 60/40 portfolio is back\u201d\nduring those years. But structurally and probabilistically, the 60/40\nportfolio should be expected to produce worse results during the next several\ndecades compared to its prior golden period.\n\n## A Broader Portfolio\n\nThere have been many alternative portfolio models suggested for decades.\n\nDecades ago, Harry Browne popularized the Permanent Portfolio, which he\ndescribed as 25% stocks, 25% bonds, 25% cash, and 25% gold. Notably, this\nbecame popular after a period of high inflation throughout the 1970s, where\nthe 60/40 portfolio would have performed poorly and this 25/25/25/25 portfolio\nwould have done way better (although gold was illegal for Americans to own\nfrom the mid-1930s to the mid-1970s).\n\nIn 2009, Meb Faber and Eric Richardson wrote The Ivy Portfolio, which is\nanother portfolio concept. This portfolio consists of five slices of 20% each\nin U.S. stocks, international stocks, intermediate bonds, commodities, and\nREITs. And importantly, you only stay in a slice if they are in a structural\nuptrend (for example, above their 10-month moving average), and go to cash for\nthat slice otherwise. This was written after a decade of weak U.S. stock\nmarket returns, where owning commodities, REITs, and foreign assets would have\nbeen better. I like this portfolio concept quite a bit, and more broadly I\nlike Faber\u2019s work in general.\n\nYou can find all manner of investors\u2019 and authors\u2019 portfolio concepts here.\nWhat they mostly have in common is that they introduce a commodity or gold\nsegment to what is otherwise a stock/bond portfolio. This is because during\nthose inflationary decades, that segment is what tends to do well as both\nstocks and bonds perform poorly.\n\nI previously highlighted the 1910s, 1940s, 1970s, and 2000s as weak decades\nfor both stocks and bonds in real terms. During those decades, energy assets\ninvariably did well. Gold and silver usually did well. Copper and other\ncommodities usually did well. The benefits of diversification in that sense\nare clear throughout modern financial history, both logically and\nquantifiably. The higher prices of these base materials are what\u2019s pressuring\nstocks and bonds during those periods, and so it helps to own the base\nmaterials and/or their producers alongside stocks and bonds.\n\nI have been recommending what I have called the \u201cthree pillar portfolio\u201d\nduring this period of fiscal dominance. It has been a cornerstone concept of\nhow I have been investing in the macro sense. For me, the three main pillars\nconsist of 1) profitable equities 2) commodities/producers and hard monies and\n3) cash-equivalents.\n\nProfitable equities do the best when there is a period of disinflationary\neconomic growth. Commodities and their producers do the best when there is a\nperiod of inflation or stagflation. Cash-equivalents hold up well during\ndisinflationary credit contractions, when almost everything else is falling\nrelative to society\u2019s unit of account that most debts are denominated in.\n\nThis three pillar portfolio has been geared toward the expectation of above-\ntarget inflation, and from a starting point of long duration bond yields being\nvery low and unattractive (I wrote about bonds likely being in a bubble near\ntheir peak back in 2019, which drove some of my investment decisions).\nReplacing the long duration bonds in my portfolios with a combination of cash,\nshort duration bonds, and gold has been helpful in what has turned out to be\nthe worst period of performance for long duration bonds in modern history from\nthat bubble high.\n\nThere are multiple ways to structure a portfolio like this, but what I would\nemphasize is having some sort of commodity or hard money slice that is\nseparate from the others. Right when hardly anybody wants exposure to things\nlike gold, bitcoin, energy producers, or commodity producers, is precisely\nwhen they tend to start doing well. As inflation picks up, energy and\ncommodities perform well when stocks and bonds do not. And as bonds perform\npoorly, investors flee to harder money alternatives.\n\n## Portfolio Updates\n\nI have several investment accounts, and I provide updates on my asset\nallocation and investment selections for some of the portfolios in each\nnewsletter issue every six weeks.\n\nThese portfolios include the model portfolio account specifically for this\nnewsletter and my relatively passive indexed retirement account. Members of my\npremium research service also have access to three additional model portfolios\nand my other holdings, with more frequent updates.\n\n### M1 Finance Newsletter Portfolio\n\nI started this account in September 2018 with $10k of new capital, and I\ndollar-cost average in over time.\n\nIt\u2019s one of my smallest accounts, but the goal is for the portfolio to be\naccessible and to show newsletter readers my best representation of where I\nthink value is in the market. It\u2019s a low-turnover multi-asset globally\ndiversified portfolio that focuses on liquid investments and is scalable to\nvirtually any size.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the breakdown of the holdings in those slices:\n\nChanges since the previous issue:\n\n  * Replaced KMI with HAL.\n\nPortfolio Returns:\n\nThe portfolio is a globally-diversified multi-asset portfolio, and so for my\nbenchmark I use the iShares Core Aggressive Allocation ETF (AOA), which is a\nglobally-diversified 80/20 stock/bond portfolio. This portfolio is my\nimplementation of a three-pillar portfolio compared to the typical stock/bond\nbenchmark.\n\nSince I dollar-cost average into the portfolio, I calculate the returns\ncompared to if I had instead dollar-cost average into AOA in the same amounts\nand on the same dates, and measure the gain over principal.\n\nSo far, a total of $61,000 has been dollar-cost averaged into the portfolio\nover the course of five and a half years, and as of the end of Q1 2024 it had\napproximately $97.5k in assets, thanks to a total $36.5k gain over principal.\n\nIf I had instead dollar-cost averaged into AOA on the same dates, I would have\nonly had approximately $80k in assets, which would have been a $19k gain over\nprincipal.\n\nMost of the excess returns came from replacing a small slice (typically 2-5%)\nof the equity portion with bitcoin-related securities, and by using a\ncombination of shorter-duration bonds and precious metals for the 20%\ndefensive portion instead of longer-duration bonds. These small changes to the\nbaseline were the primary results that led to superior growth with a similar\noverall level of volatility and max drawdowns so far.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results; this is just an assessment\nof how the strategy has performed so far.\n\nBitcoin Note:\n\nI use allocations to bitcoin price proxies such as MSTR and spot bitcoin ETFs\nin some of my brokerage portfolios for lack of the ability to directly buy\nbitcoin in a brokerage environment, but compared to those types of securities,\nthe real thing is ideal.\n\nI recommend holding actual bitcoin for those that want exposure to it, and\nlearning how to self-custody it. I buy mine through Swan.com.\n\nI don\u2019t have a firm view on the bitcoin price over the next few months, but I\nam bullish with a 2-year view and beyond.\n\n### Other Model Portfolios and Accounts\n\nI have three other real-money model portfolios that I share within my premium\nresearch service, including:\n\n  * Fortress Income Portfolio\n  * ETF-Only Portfolio\n  * No Limits Portfolio\n\nPlus, I have personal accounts at Fidelity and Schwab, and I share those\nwithin the service as well.\n\n## Final Thoughts: Abundant vs Scarce\n\nMost successful investing can be summed up as \u201cgo short abundant things and go\nlong scarce things\u201d. For example, you borrow (a.k.a. short) fiat currency\nwhich is abundant to buy properties and businesses which are scarcer and more\nenergy/labor intensive.\n\nScarcity is not the only factor to consider (i.e. for an investment to be\nsuccessful you generally also need the scarce thing to be desirable and\ngrowing or maintaining market share vs similar scarce things that fulfill a\nsimilar niche), but analyzing investments through the lens of abundance vs\nscarcity is a good first step.\n\nIn an era of fiscal dominance, bonds are among the most abundant things\naround. The U.S. government will be running $1.5-$2.5 trillion annual deficits\nfor the foreseeable future, and going structurally upward from there. The\nCongressional Budget Office estimates that there will be $20 trillion worth of\ncumulative fiscal deficits over the next decade, and their assumptions are\nthat interest rates will be lower than they are currently and also that no\nrecessions will occur. If interest rates are higher than their expectations or\nsome recessions occur within the next decade, then that $20 trillion estimate\nis likely to be exceeded.\n\nThis represents at least $20 trillion supply in new federal bonds for sale\nthis decade, and even more the next decade, and even more the decade after\nthat. That\u2019s not an asset class that I want to be structurally overweight,\neven as it will likely have good years here and there.\n\nIn comparison, at current production rates and prices, somewhere in the\nballpark of $2.5 trillion worth of refined gold will likely be mined and\nminted over the next decade. Changes in prices or production rates could\nchange that, but gold\u2019s production rate only changes slowly, which leaves\nprice as the primary absorption mechanism if more or less capital wants to\nflow in.\n\nSimilarly, at current prices about $70 billion worth of bitcoin will be\nproduced over the next decade. Its supply growth rate is fixed regardless of\nits price action, but changes in price can act as an absorption mechanism\ndepending on how much capital wants to move into or out of the asset.\n\nStocks also represent a scarcer alternative to currencies and bonds, but only\nif purchased at the right price. For example, I\u2019m not exactly rushing to buy\nstocks like Costco (COST) at 46x earnings here. It\u2019s a great company, but\neveryone knows it\u2019s a great company and so it\u2019s already heavily owned by\ninvestors.\n\nF.A.S.T. Graphs 101:\n\n  * black line: the current and historical stock price\n  * blue line: what the stock price would be if were at its own historically average price/earnings ratio\n  * orange line: a common measure of valuation (a 15x price/earnings in this case)\n  * white line: dividends paid that year (and the payout ratio is relative to the orange line)\n  * dark/light green: the transition between historical earnings numbers and consensus analysts\u2019 forecast earnings numbers\n\nMost equities that I look to buy have a dividend-adjusted\nprice/earnings/growth ratio (\u201cPEG ratio\u201d) at 2x or below, and a business model\nthat I expect to still be relevant a decade from now.\n\nIn other words, if a company has or is likely to have 8% annual earnings\ngrowth and a 2% dividend yield (a combination of 10%), along with a product or\nservice that I expected to be as relevant or more in the 2030s as it is in the\n2020s, then that\u2019s an interesting company that I\u2019d pay up to around 20x\nearnings for. Or as another example, if a company has 15% annual earnings\ngrowth and pays no dividend, then I\u2019d consider it at a valuation of up to\nabout 30x earnings.\n\nI can vary those entry valuation limits a bit depending on the strength of the\nbalance sheet and other investment opportunities that are around, but that\nframework generally presents a decent starting point for good returns with a\nmargin of safety.\n\nBest regards,\n\nTweet\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nThis site provides equity research and investment strategies to give you the\ninsight and data you need for managing your money through all market\nconditions.\n\nClick here to join the free investing newsletter.\n\n#### Featured On:\n\n#### Social Media:\n\nTwitter: @lynaldencontact\n\nLinkedIn: in/lynalden\n\nNostr: primal.net/lyn\n\n(I am not active on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, or other social\nmedia.
