Challenge authority. You have the power in any\nsituation. This is how to realize it and use it. A must-read classic from 1980\nfrom a master negotiator. My notes here aren\u2019t enough because the little book\nis filled with so many memorable stories \u2014 examples of great day-to-day\nmoments of negotiation that will stick in your head for when you need them. (I\nespecially loved the one about the power of the prisoner in solitary\nconfinement.) So go buy and read the book. I\u2019m giving it a 10/10 rating even\nthough the second half of the book loses steam, because the first half is so\ncrucial.\n\n## my notes\n\nPower is the capacity or ability to get things done. It determines whether you\ncan or can\u2019t influence your environment. It gives you a sense of mastery over\nyour life.\n\nAll power is based on perception. If you think you\u2019ve got it, then you\u2019ve got\nit. You have more power if you believe you have power and view your life\u2019s\nencounters as negotiations.\n\nMost people firmly believe that they can\u2019t negotiate. This is a prime example\nof creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nForce yourself to go outside your own experience by vigorously testing your\nassumptions. You\u2019ll discover, to your astonishment, that many of them are\nfalse.\n\nAlways have a sense of mastery over your situation. Pick and choose your\nopportunities based upon your needs. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be manipulated or\nintimidated by those who aren\u2019t concerned with your best interests.\n\nYou have the freedom to choose your attitude toward any given set of\ncircumstances and the ability to affect the outcome. You can play a much\ngreater role than you thought in shaping your life and improving your\nlifestyle.\n\nUnreality is the true source of powerlessness. What we do not understand, we\ncannot control.\n\nIf life is a game, negotiation is a way of life.\n\nYou must be reality oriented - seeing things as they really are without\npassing judgment. \u201cSee it like it is!\u201d Take into account hard-nosed realities\naffecting everyone.\n\nIn politics, poker, and negotiation, success derives not only from holding a\nstrong hand, but from analyzing the total situation so cards can be skillfully\nplayed. To influence an outcome, you must realistically analyze the other\nside\u2019s position, as well as your own, in light of POWER, TIME, INFORMATION.\n\nWhether you think you can or think you can\u2019t, you\u2019re right.\n\nPower isn\u2019t good or bad. It isn\u2019t moral or immoral. It isn\u2019t ethical or\nunethical. It\u2019s neutral. Power is a way of getting from one place to another.\nYou\u2019re at position A (your present situation or predicament). You want to go\nto position B (your objective, goal, or destination). Power enables you to go\nfrom A to B. It enables you to change your reality to achieve that goal.\n\nWhen you complain about power, it\u2019s because it\u2019s being used in a manipulative,\ncoercive, or domineering way; power over rather than power to. That\u2019s power\nbeing abused, and the criticism is valid. Or you don\u2019t approve of power\u2019s\ngoal, if the desired end or destination is considered corrupt and\nexploitative, even the most appropriate means won\u2019t make that end acceptable.\nOther than in these two instances, I see no objection to the use of power.\nSplit power from its many possible goals. The goals may be \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d\nbut the power to implement the goals is a neutral force. Electricity isn\u2019t bad\njust because it can shock. Wind isn\u2019t bad because it occasionally makes\ntornadoes. We need power to protect ourselves and to ensure that we have a\nsense of mastery over our lives. You have plenty of power. Use it to sensibly\nimplement objectives that are important to you.\n\nYou owe it to yourself not to live by what someone else thinks you ought to\ndo.\n\nIf you turn away because you believe you are helpless (\u201cWhat can one person\ndo?\u201d), you\u2019ll no doubt feel frustrated and wretched. When people in our\nsociety believe they can\u2019t, as individuals, make a difference, it\u2019s bad for\nall of us. \u201cPowerless\u201d people become apathetic and toss in the towel, which\nmeans others have to carry them on their backs, or they become hostile and try\nto tear down a system they can\u2019t understand and don\u2019t believe they can\ncontrol.\n\nLynette Fromme attempted to gun down President Gerald Ford. After her arrest,\nshe explained, \u201cWhen people around you treat you like a child and pay no\nattention to the things you say, you have to do something!\u201d The \u201csomething\u201d\nSqueaky did was psychopathic and self-destructive. She didn\u2019t realize that she\nhad other alternatives that were socially acceptable and legal. A criminal\nact, regardless of its goal, is almost always an abuse of power.\n\nPower is neutral. It\u2019s a means, not an end. It\u2019s indispensable for mental\nhealth and nonaggressive survival.\n\nYou have power if you perceive that you have it. Even a prisoner in solitary\nconfinement, desperate for a cigarette. (story)\n\nWithin reason, you can get whatever you want if you\u2019re aware of your options,\nif you test your assumptions, if you take shrewdly calculated risks based on\nsolid information, and if you believe you have power.\n\nBelieve firmly that you have power, and you\u2019ll convey that self-confident\nperception to others. You determine how they see, believe, and react to you.\nPower is their perception that you can, and just might, bring about intended\neffects that they believe might help them or hurt them. The Wizard of Oz: Who\ndoes the Wizard turn out to be? Just a bumbling old man with a smoke machine\nand a noisemaker. In reality he had no power, but he exercised a great deal of\npower because everyone was convinced he had it.\n\nThe power of competition: Whenever you create competition for something you\npossess, what you have moves up in value. \u201cI have a marvelous idea.\u201d \u201cHave you\ndiscussed it with anyone else?\u201d \u201cYes, but they don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth very\nmuch.\u201d Your idea is devalued because there\u2019s no competition for it. But if in\nresponse to my question you reply, \u201cYes ... I talked it over with others at\nyour level, and they said they\u2019d like to hear more, because it sounds\nterrific!\u201d Through creating competition, you\u2019ve made your idea valuable and\ndesirable. That\u2019s why it\u2019s easier to get a job when you already have one.\n\nScenario: You need a loan. Is it good to approach the bank on bended knee and\nsay, \u201cPlease help me. I\u2019m destitute. Save my family from the horrors of\nbankruptcy. I can\u2019t repay.\u201d No. Put on a suit. Wear an expensive gold watch.\nHave three of your friends - your entourage - outfit themselves the same way.\nWalk through the bank, exuding the impression, \u201cHi there! I\u2019m a top executive\nstriding through the bank. Keep away from me with your lousy money ... I don\u2019t\nneed it.\u201d By using the \u201cKeep away from me with your lousy money\u201d ploy, Lance\nwas granted 381 loans by 41 banks. Why did banks compete with each other to\nlend huge sums of money to Lance? For three reasons: Because other banks were\nlending him money, which for all practical purposes meant his credit was\nfirst-rate. Because banks thought he didn\u2019t need the money. That was their\nperception, based on the fact that he acted blas\u00e9. He seemingly hadn\u2019t a care\nin the world. Lance\u2019s attitude was that he was doing banks a favor by giving\nthem the opportunity to lend him money. Most important, because he obviously\nhad options. He could borrow from any bank he wanted to, picking and choosing\nas he saw fit. This put banks in dog-eat-dog competition with each other to\npush money into his hands. When the same banks learned that Lance desperately\nneeded these loans to pay back other loans, his sources dried up. He perceived\nthat he had options and capitalized on them. He cashed in on the competition\nhe created. You should do the same whenever possible. Above all, never enter a\nnegotiation without options.\n\nAnything that\u2019s the product of a negotiation has got to be negotiable,\nincluding the price on the sign. There was no Big Printer in the Sky.\n\nThe power of legitimacy. Printed words, documents, and signs carry authority.\nMost people tend not to question them. Legitimacy can be questioned and\nchallenged. Use the power of legitimacy when it\u2019s advantageous for you to do\nso and challenge that power when it\u2019s advantageous for you to do so. When\nsomeone says \u201cthe book says it right here\u201d, I say, \u201cDoes that book mention my\nname? Does it indicate the location and address of my building?\u201d If they say,\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d I say, \u201cThen I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my book.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t argue\nwith the book!\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause no one ever did it before!\u201d Think\nabout the book I successfully challenged. It was an IRS document, which was\nthe product of a negotiation, drawn up by bureaucrats to interpret a\nregulation that was also the product of a negotiation. Since the book\u2019s\nposition was the end result of a negotiation, the matter was negotiable.\n\nBefore you can hit the jackpot, you have to put a coin in the machine. You\nmust be willing to take risks.\n\nAlways induce the other side to invest in a situation. That\u2019s why your initial\napproach to a negotiation should always be collaborative, as though you\u2019re\nhungry for help. In negotiation, dumb is often better than smart, inarticulate\nfrequently better than articulate, and many times weakness can actually be\nstrength. Train yourself to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Think of your own experiences\nwhen dealing with stupid people. Your sophisticated arguments and persuasive\ndevices are worthless when you\u2019re dealing with a moron who can\u2019t even\ncomprehend what you\u2019re talking about. Don\u2019t be too quick to \u201cunderstand\u201d. Ask\nquestions, even when you think you might know the answers.\n\nThe company\u2019s presentation lasted two and a half hours. The Japanese smiled\npolitely and answered, \u201cWe don\u2019t understand. Can you do it again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found a house we\u2019re crazy about. I want to buy it. Help negotiate the\nprice?\u201d \u201cWhat would happen if you didn\u2019t get this dream house?\u201d He replied,\n\u201cAre you kidding? I think my wife would kill herself! I think my kids would\nleave home! I\u2019ll do anything for them! We just have to bring the asking price\ndown.\u201d Take a guess. Did Smith pay $130,000 for the dream house or $150,000?\nYou\u2019re right, he paid $150,000. With his attitude he\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t pay\n$160,000. That house meant so much to him that he was unwilling to risk losing\nit. Because he cared too much. Moral: Care, but never that much. When you feel\nyou have to have something, you always pay top dollar, and the other party can\nmanipulate you with ease.\n\nHave knowledge of the \u201codds,\u201d plus a philosophical willingness to shrug your\nshoulders. Take moderate or incremental risks: risks you can afford without\nbeing uptight about adverse consequences. Before chancing anything, calculate\nthe odds to determine whether the potential benefits are worth the possible\ncost of failure. Be rational, not impulsive. Never take a risk out of pride,\nimpatience, or a desire to get it over with.\n\nWealth enables one to explore favorable opportunities, for the inherent risk\nis moderate. It\u2019s no more than bite-size. In case of loss, the wealthy person\ncan shrug.\n\nTap in on the power of expertise. Most of us rarely question the statements of\ntax accountants, physicians, auto mechanics, attorneys, computer specialists,\nstock brokers, research scientists, professors. If you want to present\nyourself as having expertise: Establish your background and credentials early\nin the confrontation. The only kind of expertise required for most\nnegotiations is the ability to ask intelligent questions and know whether you\nare getting accurate responses.\n\nIn all negotiations, there are two things being bargained for: 1. The specific\nissues and demands, which are stated openly. 2. The real needs of the other\nside, which are rarely verbalized.\n\nBuying a car example: I gather as much specific data as I can about the car\nitself. Next, I find out as much as possible about the dealership. Then, with\nrespect to the dealer himself, I acquaint myself with his likes, dislikes,\nprejudices, and value system. I find out if he\u2019s the type who makes quick\ndecisions or deliberate decisions. I probe, observe, ask questions, and listen\nmore than I talk. This gives me valuable information that enables me to best\nstructure the negotiation. I then adapt my purchasing style to satisfy the\nreal needs of the seller.\n\nInformation: What do you know about the salesman\u2019s needs or the store\u2019s needs?\nIs the salesman on salary, commission, or a combination of both? What\u2019s the\ninventory situation on this model? Is it the store\u2019s hottest item, currently\non backorder, or is it a dog the store manager will dump at any price? Is the\nstore making a profit on this model? If so, how much?\n\nAlmost anything you say furthers the informational imbalance and strengthens\nthe salesman\u2019s hand.\n\nIf you have something difficult to negotiate, cope with it at the end of a\nnegotiation, after the other side has made a hefty expenditure of energy and a\nsubstantial time investment. What if the emotional issue or quantifiable item\nsurfaces at the beginning of the negotiation? Acknowledge it, chat about it,\nbut put it off till later - returning to it only after the other side has\nspent a lot of time with you. You\u2019ll be surprised how the other side\u2019s\ninvestment will cause them to become flexible at the end of the negotiation.\n\nYour perception that I can and might help you or hurt you gives me \u201cmuscle\u201d in\nour relationship. The \u201cactual, factual\u201d reality of the situation is\nimmaterial. If you think I can and might do something to affect you (even\nthough I can\u2019t or won\u2019t), I will exercise power in my dealings with you. It\u2019s\nperception, true or false. No one will ever negotiate with you in any\nsignificant way unless they\u2019re convinced that you can and might help them - or\ncan and might hurt them. In an adversary relationship, if you think I might\nhelp you or hurt you, I should never defuse your perception of my power unless\nI get something in return, such as a concession on your part, or a\nrepositioning on your part, that truly benefits me or our relationship.\n\nJimmy Carter: Unfortunately, he immediately spelled out what we would or\nwouldn\u2019t do. In the eyes of some adversaries this promptly transformed us into\na paper tiger, no more threatening than your neighbor\u2019s kitten. He made the\nunfortunate mistake of publicly eliminating options without getting something\nin return.\n\nDon\u2019t eliminate options and reduce the other side\u2019s stress unless you receive\nquid pro quo. Let them wonder until you have received what you\u2019re shooting\nfor.\n\nMost people aren\u2019t persistent enough when negotiating. They present something\nto the other side, and if the other side doesn\u2019t \u201cbuy\u201d it right away, they\nshrug and move on to something else. Learn to hang in there. You must be\ntenacious.\n\nWho\u2019s the worst person you can negotiate for? Yourself. You do a much better\njob negotiating for someone else. Why? Because you take yourself too seriously\nin any interaction that concerns you. You care too much about yourself. That\nputs you under pressure and stress. When you negotiate for someone else,\nyou\u2019re more relaxed. You\u2019re more objective. You don\u2019t care as much, because\nyou regard the situation as fun or as a game - which it is. Regard all\nencounters and situations, including your job, as a game, as the world of\nillusion. Pull back a little and enjoy it all. Things are seldom what they\nseem. Teach yourself to say, \u201cBig deal,\u201d \u201cWho cares?\u201d and \u201cSo what?\u201d You\u2019ll\nget better results, because your attitude will convey your feeling of power\nand mastery of your life.\n\nWe fail to get adequate information because we regard negotiation as an event\nobtaining information under pressing deadline. These conditions present\nenormous difficulties. The actual starting point of a negotiation always\nprecedes the face-to-face happening by weeks or even months. It\u2019s a process.\nOld horse traders never let the seller know which horse really interests them,\nbecause if they did the price might go up. Learn what the other side really\nwant, their limits, and their deadline. How do you gather this information?\nYou start early, because the earlier you start, the easier it is to obtain\ninformation. You always get more information preceding an acknowledged, formal\nconfrontation. If you wait until the last minute, they say, \u201cCome on ... I\ncan\u2019t tell you anything now - it\u2019s negotiation time!\u201d Quietly and consistently\nprobe.\n\nThe more confused and defenseless you seem, the more readily they will help\nyou with information and advice. Ask questions even when you think you know\nthe answers, because by doing so, you test the credibility of the other side.\nYou want to know the real limits on the other side, that is, the extent beyond\nwhich they will not go. The more information you have about their financial\nsituation, priorities, deadlines, costs, real needs, and organizational\npressures, the better you can bargain. And the sooner you start to acquire\nthese data, the easier they will be to obtain. You have to give information in\norder to get some in return.\n\nTactic that is identified for what it is - a tactic that\u2019s seen through - is\nineffective.\n\nNever negotiate with anyone totally lacking in authority. In most instances,\nan order-enforcing subordinate is simply a mouthpiece, acting in a robotlike\nmanner. Sidestep robots. Negate any policy that\u2019s detrimental to your\ninterests by taking a step upward. The person who gives the policy can also\ntake it away. Every organization is a hierarchy. Steadily go up the ladder,\nrung by rung, until you get satisfaction. The higher you go, the more likely\nyou are to have your needs met. Why? Several reasons: People who are higher up\nunderstand that general rules were never meant to cover every specific\nsituation. They\u2019re more aware of the Big Picture and can visualize the fall-\nout that might result from improper handling. Even more significant, they have\ngreater authority and get paid to take some risks and make decisions. I had a\nreservation at a magnificent hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel could not honor\nit. The registration clerk announced that all rooms were filled. I asked to\nsee the manager. I lit a cigar, rested an elbow on the marble check-in\ncounter, and asked the manager, \u201cWhat if the president of Mexico showed up?\nWould you have a room for him?\u201d \u201cS\u00ed se\u00f1or ...\u201d I blew a smoke ring toward the\nceiling. \u201cWell, he\u2019s not coming, so I\u2019ll take his room.\u201d Did I get a room? You\nbet, but I had to promise that if the president arrived, I would vacate\nimmediately.\n\nNever allow yourself - or anyone who negotiates for you - unlimited authority.\nThe worst person you can negotiate for is yourself. When you handle your own\nnegotiations you have total authority, and it\u2019s easy to make snap decisions\nwithout making proper use of your time. How can you get around this? By\nimposing checks and balances on yourself. By deliberately limiting yourself,\nbeing obedient to your own dictates.\n\nDon\u2019t negotiate on the phone. Saying no on the phone is easy. Being\nunreasonable on the phone is easy. Saying no and being unreasonable face to\nface is something else again. It\u2019s easy for people to shaft others if they\ndon\u2019t see them in personal terms. Don\u2019t let yourself become a bloodless\nstatistic.\n\nWe all want something. Prestige, freedom, money, justice, status, love,\nsecurity, recognition, etc.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
