It felt like something you wanted to explore.\n\nSearch engines weren't where you went to check for something in particular, it\nwas where you went to learn something new. Something you had never even\nthought of.\n\nThe web today is still somewhere you can do all that. Unfortunately, the\nweighting towards updated information, and social media, means that all the\nnew things get buried by the places that have teams of people working away on\nSearch Engine Optimisation.\n\nRusty was the idea of weighting content higher.\n\nThe exact weighting system is rather complicated, but it approves of text\ncontent, and disapproves of JavaScript. It approves of accessibility, and\napproves of linking to other sites. It also completely ignores pages with\nduplicate descriptions. Or pages that don't make use of HTTPS.\n\nIn short, Rusty tries to make it easy to find new things.\n\nOf course, there all kinds of little gimmicks to make the experience better.\nRusty understands basic maths. It drops randomised pages so you can spot\nsomething brand new. It picks up emails and phone numbers.\n\nJust because we want the old web, doesn't mean we can't learn - the opposite.\nWe're trying to learn from our mistakes, and give you what you want.\n\n## Explore\n\ngnu-social-mode-devel Archives\n\nlists.gnu.org\n\nSearch String: [How to search] Display: 10 20 30 50 100 Description: normal\nshort Sort: by score in reverse chronological order in chronological order\nby...\n\nSusan Egan - IMDb\n\nwww.imdb.com\n\nSusan Egan.
