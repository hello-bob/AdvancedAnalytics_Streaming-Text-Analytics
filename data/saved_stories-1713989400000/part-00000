It could also\nflop.\n\nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health\nand science.\n\nExplore our new section\n\nThe challenges are immense. Hydrogen fuel is expensive \u2014 as much as four times\nmore expensive than gasoline or diesel fuel. The fuel cells, which drive\nelectric motors to drive the truck, are enormously expensive as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaking hydrogen itself is now a dirty, greenhouse-gas-generating process,\nalthough green hydrogen production is an emerging option, and even more\nexpensive. Hydrogen proponents are banking on the idea that scaling up\nproduction will bring prices down\n\nNew diesel truck sales will be outlawed in California by 2036. Only zero-\ntailpipe-emission new trucks will be allowed. Already, zero-emission\nrequirements are in place for trucks that enter ocean ports. And only two\ntechnologies are available to achieve that goal: battery electric trucks and\nhydrogen fuel-cell trucks. \u201cWe believe a good portion of those will be\nhydrogen vehicles,\u201d said Matt Miyasato, chief of public policy for hydrogen\nfuel distributor FirstElement Fuel.\n\nFirstElement, through its True Zero brand fueling stations, is the largest\nhydrogen vehicle fuel distributor in the U.S. Miyasato spoke Tuesday at a\nceremony to mark the station\u2019s opening, attended by state officials including\nLiane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board; and Tyson\nEckerle, clean transportation advisor for Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s business\ndevelopment office, Go-Biz. Primary funding for the Oakland station is\nprovided by state money channeled through the Air Resources Board and the\nCalifornia Energy Commission.\n\nA hydrogen pump at FirstElement\u2019s True Zero hydrogen fueling station at the\nPort of Oakland.\n\n(Russ Mitchell / Los Angeles Times)\n\nHydrogen fuel holds great promise for cleaner air. It is not a fossil fuel. A\nfuel cell is a kind of battery that takes in hydrogen and emits only water\nvapor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, producing hydrogen itself can be very dirty. Most hydrogen produced\ntoday requires methane, which is a fossil fuel and a strong greenhouse gas\ncontributor. The industry is working on production alternatives, including\ncarbon capture and storage from the burning of methane, or quitting methane\naltogether to make green hydrogen, using an electrolyzer to split water\u2019s\nhydrogen and oxygen. Both alternatives are prohibitively expensive without\ngovernment subsidies.\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### What will shift to zero-emission trucks cost? $1 trillion for charging\nalone, study says\n\nThe study, sponsored by the freight truck industry, adds to concerns over\ngovernment mandates. But government officials say the move away from fossil\nfuels will have economic benefits.\n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\nThe federal government is handing out $8 billion to jump-start what it calls\nthe \u201chydrogen economy\u201d by creating so-called hydrogen hubs. One of them will\nbe set in California, which is expected to take in $1.2 billion for the\nproject.\n\nEckerle said the hub funding will allow construction of 60 more hydrogen truck\nstations in California, enough to serve 5,000 trucks and 1,000 buses.\n\nThe vehicles themselves are expensive too. Both battery electric and hydrogen\nfuel-cell trucks can cost three times as much or more than a $120,000 diesel\ntruck. Those buying the trucks can qualify for state and federal subsidies to\nmake up most of the upfront costs.\n\nBattery electric is gaining a strong foothold in the medium-sized delivery\ntruck market, but hydrogen could have a leg up for long-haul trucking. While a\nfuel cell is comparable in size to a diesel engine, a battery big enough for\nlong-haul trucks adds weight and size and cuts down on the total freight load\nthe truck can deliver. And while an battery electric truck can take hours to\nrecharge, the refill time for hydrogen is more comparable to filling up with\ndiesel fuel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### Can California pull off the epic transition to EVs?
