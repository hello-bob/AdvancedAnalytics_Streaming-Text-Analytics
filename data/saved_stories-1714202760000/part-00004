Someone posted a clickbait article\nstriking fear into our hearts about whatever topic du jour the mass media\nwanted us to panic about to get more clicks and ad revenue.\n\nThen a user on this particular social media leveraged that panic and added\ntheir own title to gain useless internet likes to feel more important.\n\nThe headline screamed something like:\n\n> \u201cSloths on average get laid 1000% more often than you! That\u2019s 10 times\n> more!\u201d\n\nOnly slightly miffed, I wrote:\n\n> \u201cFun fact: 1000% more of something is 11 x something\u201d\n\nWhat followed was tens of thousands of strangers from all around the world\ntaking precious time out of their day to craft some of the most creative\ninsults imaginable.\n\n  * \u201cSo cute, it thinks it can do math.\u201d\n\n  * \u201cYou\u2019re the reason teachers need summer off.\u201d\n\n  * \u201cThis guy\u2019s a human version of a typo.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, I broke my rule. I explained the logic (AKA truth) over and\nover again.\n\nPoorly, apparently.\n\nThe ridicule piled on and on and on.\n\nThe interesting part? About 1/3 of the audience was backing my claims, but\nnary said a word of support.\n\nCowards, the lot of them!\n\nThere went an hour I\u2019ll never get back.\n\nBut that wasted hour just reinforced my rule.\n\nI axed the thread, ditched the app for the non-logged-in browser version, and\nsaved myself endless future arguments (and hours).\n\nWhen debating on the internet, one must remember two things:\n\n  1. No one ever wins.\n\n  2. George Carlin.\n\n\u201cThink of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are\nstupider than that.\u201d\n\nIn the end, I did manage to get through to one person after an extended back\nand forth of received ad hominems and projected source-backed explanations.\n\n> \u201cFine. Against my better judgment, I\u2019ll be the better man and admit you\u2019re\n> right.\u201d\n\nSigh.\n\nWritten by a currently non-argumentative J.J.
