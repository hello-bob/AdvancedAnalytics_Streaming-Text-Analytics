Credit: Science China Press\n\nA team led by Prof. Dexin Ye and Prof. Hongsheng Chen from Zhejiang\nUniversity, and Prof. Yu Luo from Nanyang Technological University conducted\nresearch on the practical implementation of full-parameter transformation\noptical devices. Based on the linear transformation optics and the\nconstitution theory of omnidirectionally matched transparent metamaterials,\nthe research team designed and implemented a full-parameter omnidirectional\ninvisibility cloak capable of concealing large-scale objects in free space.\n\nThis work has been published in National Science Review titled \"Full-parameter\nomnidirectional transformation optical devices,\" with Dr. Yuan Gao from\nZhejiang University as the first author, Prof. Yu Luo, Prof. Hongsheng Chen\nand Prof. Dexin Ye as corresponding authors.\n\nIn 2006, Prof. Pendry from Imperial College London proposed the transformation\noptics, which describes the correspondence between the propagation path of\nelectromagnetic (EM) waves and the constitutive parameters of materials,\nproviding a universal and powerful method to control EM waves.\n\nThe past decade has witnessed the rapid development of transformation optics,\nthrough which various novel optical devices such as invisibility cloaks,\nelectromagnetic illusion devices and concentrators have been designed.\nHowever, the constitutive parameters of transformation optics media are\nanisotropic, and generally inhomogeneous or with singular values, making\nthemselves difficult to be implemented.\n\nFor example, the omnidirectional invisibility cloaks that have been\nexperimentally implemented so far have always undergone some simplifications\non the material parameters. The simplified designs sacrifice the impedance\nmatching and thus deteriorate the performance of the transformation optical\ndevices.\n\nTo address these issues, the research group designed a 2D full-parameter\nomnidirectional planar invisibility cloak composed of only two homogeneous\nmaterials based on linear transformation optics. The constitutive parameters\nof the first material are anisotropic, with both zero and extreme values, and\nthe EM waves propagating in the optical direction have an infinite phase\nvelocity.\n\nThis material is used to enable the EM wave to bypass a cloaking region with\nomnidirectional impedance matching and zero phase delay. The second material\nalso possesses anisotropic constitutive parameters to achieve phase\ncompensation with omnidirectional impedance matching, and the EM waves\npropagating in the optical direction have a subluminal phase velocity.\n\nIn the experimental verification, researchers implemented these two materials\nwith full-parameter constitutive parameters for the TM-polarized wave.\n\nThe first one was realized using sub-wavelength metallic patch arrays with\nFabry-P\u00e9rot resonance, while the second one was obtained with the structures\ncomposed of traditional I-shaped electric resonators and split-ring\nresonators.\n\nFinally, the researchers measured the magnetic fields around the full-\nparameter omnidirectional cloak composed of the previous two materials under\nthe TM polarized wave incidence at different angles, demonstrating excellent\ninvisibility performance.\n\nThis study demonstrated the first full-parameter omnidirectional invisibility\ncloak in free space, which can conceal a large-scale object for arbitrary\nincident illumination. The implemented cloak can be immediately used to\nsuppress the scattering cross-section of the target in radar communication and\nbistatic detection.\n\nThe approach presented in this work also has far-reaching implications for the\npractical implementations of other full-parameter transformation optical\ndevices.\n\nMore information: Yuan Gao et al, Full-parameter omnidirectional\ntransformation optical devices, National Science Review (2023).
