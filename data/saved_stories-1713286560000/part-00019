We start with a one week nomination period that opens on Saturday,\nApril 20th and closes on Friday, April 26th AOE time.\n\nWe\u2019ll be doing our best to reach out to every constituent group to let them\nknow they are eligible to nominate candidates for the election. That said,\nthis is our first election and we don\u2019t yet have contact information for\neverybody who is eligible, so we want your help getting the word out.\n\nIf you are interested in nominating someone \u2013 or yourself \u2013 to be a candidate\nin this election, read this post in its entirety.\n\nTo learn about what the Governing Board is, what it does, and the context it\noperates in, read this blog post from last December. You are also welcome to\nread the Governing Board\u2019s current bylaws.\n\n## Election schedule\n\nHere is the timeline for this election season, which will happen in the second\nquarter of every year:\n\nTo minimize confusion, and maximize inclusion given our international\ncommunity, we will be using \u201cAnywhere on Earth\u201d (AOE) time. If you\u2019re not\nfamiliar with AOE time, here\u2019s what it means using our nomination period as an\nexample: so long as it\u2019s still Friday, April 26th in any timezone on the\nplanet (from UTC+12 to UTC-12), the nomination period is open.\n\n## How our elections work\n\nOur Governing Board is made up of 9 different constituency groups across 3\ncategories: nonprofit and community representatives, funder representatives,\nand foundation representatives. Each group has been allocated seats on the\nboard, gets to nominate its own slate of candidates, and gets to vote within\nthat slate of candidates.\n\nFor example, Individual Members get to nominate themselves, and vote on the\nIndividual Members who are qualified candidates. The only exception is with\nthe Managing Director (hi, that\u2019s me) who automatically gets a seat on the\nGoverning Board, but that\u2019s just one seat of many.\n\nHere is the composition of seats on the Governing Board:\n\nCommunity representatives| Funder representatives| Foundation representatives  \n---|---|---  \n4 Individual Members| 4 Platinum Members| 3 Guardians  \n3 Ecosystem Members| 3 Gold Members| 2 Spec Core Team Members  \n2 Associate Members| 2 Silver Members| Managing Director  \n  \nLearn how to become a member and see a list of our current organizational\nmembers.\n\nWe will be seating candidates for all constituency groups in our first\nelection. Starting in 2025, we\u2019ll run elections for half of the constituency\ngroups. This is so that we maintain some level of continuity and institutional\nknowledge across each election. Consequently, while the first elected\nrepresentatives from the Guardians, Spec Core Team, Platinum, and Ecosystem\nMembers will serve 2-year terms, the first elected representatives from Gold,\nSilver, Individual, and Associate Members will serve a 1-year term. We\nanticipate that many people in those constituencies who are elected this year\nwill run for re-election in 2025.\n\nThere are currently no term limits, but term limits are a best practice in\nopen governance so we intend to introduce them as we find our collective\nfooting.\n\nFor greater detail, please read this blog post from last December.\n\n## Who can nominate\n\nYou must be a member of one of the constituency groups in order to nominate\nyourself or someone else to be a candidate in the election. By far our largest\nconstituency group are Individual Members, who number in the 100\u2019s. If you\nhave donated at least $60 USD to the Foundation since April 20, 2023, on any\nof Donorbox, Patreon, or Liberapay, then you are eligible to nominate and\nvote.\n\nAll nominees must have consented to nomination before being nominated and must\nbe a community member in good standing. That means they must have a clean\ntrack record with respect to our Code of Conduct. We want our Governing Board\nto be a clearing house for a variety of priorities and perspectives, and to be\nable to hold space for each other even when there are disagreements.\n\n## Who can vote\n\nAll members of each constituency group are entitled to vote on the candidates\nwithin that constituency group. We will be reaching out to everyone we have\ncontact information for, to ensure we have our voter rolls together before\nvoting begins in May.\n\nWe will hold an election for every constituency even if a given constituency\nhas fewer candidates than there are seats allocated for them on the Governing\nBoard. This is, effectively, as a vote of confidence.\n\nIf you believe you are eligible to participate but have not heard from us or\nOpaVote \u2013 the election system we have chosen for this year\u2019s elections \u2013 by\nMay 10th, please email us promptly. We cannot change our voter rolls after\nvoting begins on May 17th!\n\nAll of the candidates will be listed on an elections page here on our website\nwhich we\u2019ll publish on April 29th.\n\n## How to prepare yourself\n\nIf you want to be a candidate in the election, there are a few things you\nshould know:\n\n  * All candidates will be listed on our website, grouped by the constituency group.\n  * We do not require people to use their \u201clegal name.\u201d\n  * Candidates who are nominated by an organizational member will have their affiliation listed.\n  * We expect candidates to provide a short bio and a short statement, collectively covering qualifications and priorities.\n  * You are encouraged to make yourself available for conversation with members of your constituency group.\n  * The period for campaigning runs from April 27th to May 17th. Please note our community Code of Conduct while campaigning.\n\n## What to expect if you win\n\nCongratulations! All of the winners will be announced on June 3rd, but since\nthe elections conclude on May 31st, you may get an email with the results of\nthe election you participated in before June 3rd.\n\nAll elected representatives will be added to a private mailing list and Matrix\nroom so that they can introduce themselves and communicate in between\nmeetings. I will be reaching out to every elected representative to meet one-\non-one, get acquainted, and answer questions before we convene for our first\nGoverning Board meeting. Given the size of the board and the international\nnature of our ecosystem, those one-on-one meetings will likely happen over the\ncourse of a couple months.\n\nThe Governing Board will meet as a full board twice a year, for at least 90\nminutes each time, and our first 1-2 meetings will have a professional\nfacilitator to help us collectively put our best foot forward. Expect one\nmeeting before the end of the year, and another before the next election.\n\nYou are likely to receive a packet of materials before each meeting which you\nwill be expected to have reviewed. Most meetings will be held online, though\nwe may convene meetings in-person, such as at the (soon to be announced)\nannual Matrix Conference. We will make every effort to make in-person meetings\naccessible to remote participants, and no official business will ever happen\nwithout appropriate notice, quorum, and minutes.\n\nWhile the Governing Board is an advisory board, members are encouraged to play\na role in helping to carry out the activities that support the staff in\ndelivering on the Foundation\u2019s collective remit, such as coalescing priorities\nto share with the Spec Core Team and connecting with contributors and funders\nto implement proposals.\n\nWe intend to charter committees \u2013 such as for finance, which would review our\nannual budget in detail \u2013 who will meet in between Governing Board meetings\nand present their assessments and recommendations to the Governing Board.\nThese committees are where the bulk of the activity will take place since the\nboard, which may have up to 24 members, is quite large.\n\n## How to nominate\n\nWe will update this blog post with a link to a nomination form and a template\ndocument on Friday, April 19th. We\u2019ll be reaching out to everyone who is\neligible and whose contact information we have to let them know. We\u2019ll also be\nannouncing it on our social channels.\n\nAll nominations should be submitted through the form, though anyone who has\ntechnical difficulties can fill out the template document and email it to\nelections@foundation.matrix.org.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support, and good luck to all the candidates in the\nupcoming elections!\n\nAd astra per aspera \ud83d\ude80\n\n## The Foundation needs you\n\nThe Matrix.org Foundation is a non-profit and only relies on donations to\noperate.
