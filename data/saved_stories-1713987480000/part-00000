It supports all popular Kubernetes\nvariants and integrates with third-party AI tools and frameworks.\n\nRun:ai customers include some of the world\u2019s largest enterprises across\nmultiple industries, which use the Run:ai platform to manage data-center-scale\nGPU clusters.\n\n\u201cRun:ai has been a close collaborator with NVIDIA since 2020 and we share a\npassion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure,\u201d said\nOmri Geller, Run:ai cofounder and CEO. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to join NVIDIA and look\nforward to continuing our journey together.\u201d\n\nThe Run:ai platform provides AI developers and their teams:\n\n  * A centralized interface to manage shared compute infrastructure, enabling easier and faster access for complex AI workloads.\n  * Functionality to add users, curate them under teams, provide access to cluster resources, control over quotas, priorities and pools, and monitor and report on resource use.\n  * The ability to pool GPUs and share computing power \u2014 from fractions of GPUs to multiple GPUs or multiple nodes of GPUs running on different clusters \u2014 for separate tasks.\n  * Efficient GPU cluster resource utilization, enabling customers to gain more from their compute investments.\n\nNVIDIA will continue to offer Run:ai\u2019s products under the same business model\nfor the immediate future. And NVIDIA will continue to invest in the Run:ai\nproduct roadmap as part of NVIDIA DGX Cloud, an AI platform co-engineered with\nleading clouds for enterprise developers, offering an integrated, full-stack\nservice optimized for generative AI.\n\nNVIDIA DGX and DGX Cloud customers will gain access to Run:ai\u2019s capabilities\nfor their AI workloads, particularly for large language model deployments.\nRun:ai\u2019s solutions are already integrated with NVIDIA DGX, NVIDIA DGX\nSuperPOD, NVIDIA Base Command, NGC containers, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise\nsoftware, among other products.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform and Run:ai\u2019s platform will continue to\nsupport a broad ecosystem of third-party solutions, giving customers choice\nand flexibility.\n\nTogether with Run:ai, NVIDIA will enable customers to have a single fabric\nthat accesses GPU solutions anywhere. Customers can expect to benefit from\nbetter GPU utilization, improved management of GPU infrastructure and greater\nflexibility from the open architecture.\n\nCategories: Cloud | Corporate | Data Center | Generative AI | Software\n\n### All NVIDIA News\n\nForecasting the Future: AI2\u2019s Christopher Bretherton Discusses Using Machine\nLearning for Climate Modeling\n\nRays Up: Decoding AI-Powered DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction\n\nClimate Tech Startups Integrate NVIDIA AI for Sustainability Applications\n\nWide Open: NVIDIA Accelerates Inference on Meta Llama 3\n\nUp to No Good: \u2018No Rest for the Wicked\u2019 Early Access Launches on GeForce NOW\n\nExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Manage My Privacy\n  * Legal\n  * Accessibility\n  * Product Security\n  * Contact\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NVIDIA Corporation\n\nUSA - United States\n\nNVIDIA websites use cookies to deliver and improve the website experience.
