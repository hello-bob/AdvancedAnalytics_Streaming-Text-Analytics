(AP) \u2014 The manufacturer of a popular weedkiller won\nsupport Wednesday from the Missouri House for a proposal that could shield it\nfrom costly lawsuits alleging it failed to warn customers its product could\ncause cancer.\n\nThe House vote marked an important but incremental victory for chemical giant\nBayer, which acquired an avalanche of legal claims involving the weedkiller\nRoundup when it bought the product\u2019s original St. Louis-area-based producer,\nMonsanto.\n\nThe legislation now heads to the Missouri Senate with several weeks remaining\nin the annual legislative session. Bayer pursued similar legislation this year\nin Idaho and Iowa, where it has mining and manufacturing facilities, but it\nfell short in both states.\n\nBayer disputes claims that Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, causes a\ncancer called non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. But it has set aside $16 billion and\nalready paid about $10 billion of that amount to resolve some of the tens of\nthousands of legal claims against it.\n\nThough some studies associate glyphosate with cancer, the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when\nused as directed.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAmendments to Missouri Constitution are on the line amid GOP infighting\n\n2021 death of young Black man at rural Missouri home was self-inflicted, FBI\ntells AP\n\nMissouri hires Memphis athletic director Laird Veatch for the same role with\nthe Tigers\n\nThe Missouri legislation says that federally approved pesticide labeling\n\u201cshall be sufficient to satisfy any requirement for a warning label regarding\ncancer\u201d \u2014 effectively thwarting failure-to-warn allegations in future\nlawsuits.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that members of the Missouri House have supported farmers and\nscience over the litigation industry,\u201d Bayer said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nA coalition that includes Bayer has run ads on radio stations, newspapers and\nbillboards supporting the legislation.\n\nFarmers overwhelmingly rely on Roundup, which was introduced 50 years ago as a\nmore efficient way to control weeds and reduce tilling and soil erosion. For\ncrops including corn, soybeans and cotton, it\u2019s designed to work with\ngenetically modified seeds that resist Roundup\u2019s deadly effect.\n\nMore than a dozen majority party Republicans joined Democrats in voting\nagainst the legislation as it passed the House on a 91-57 vote. Some Democrats\nmade personal pleas to vote no.\n\n\u201cIf you vote for this bill, you are voting for cancer \u2014 and it will hurt my\nfeelings, and I will not smile at you on the elevator,\u201d said state Rep.\nLaDonna Appelbaum, who is undergoing treatment for cancer.\n\nSupporters said it was important to protect Bayer, whose North American crop\nscience division is based in the St. Louis area, from lawsuits that could\njeopardized the availability of Roundup. They cited concerns that Bayer\neventually could pull Roundup from the U.S. market, leaving farmers dependent\non alternative chemicals from China.\n\n\u201cThis bill isn\u2019t about cancer, it\u2019s really about the process of what\u2019s taken\nplace within the courts,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Mike Haffner, chair of\nthe House Agriculture Policy Committee.\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nJudge upholds disqualification of challenger to judge in Trump\u2019s Georgia\nelection interference case\n\nUndo\n\nTreppenlift-VergleichAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Rentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-\nVergleich:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUndo\n\nFlorida man charged with murdering girlfriend's 13-year-old daughter\n\nUndo\n\nAuthorities confirm 2nd victim of ex-Washington officer was 17-year-old with\nwhom he had a baby\n\nUndo\n\nAt least 16 people died in California after medics injected sedatives during\nencounters with police\n\nUndo\n\nOwner of exploded Michigan building arrested at airport while trying to leave\nUS, authorities sayThe owner of a suburban Detroit business that caught fire\nand exploded, killing a man, was arrested at a New York airport as he was\npreparing to depart for Hong Kong on a one-way ticket.AP News\n\nUndo\n\nProsecutors want a reversal after a Texas woman's voter fraud conviction was\noverturnedProsecutors in Texas asked the state\u2019s highest criminal appeals\ncourt on Thursday to reverse a ruling that overturned a Fort Worth woman\u2019s\nvoter fraud conviction and five-year prison term for casting an illegal\nprovisional ballot.AP News\n\nUndo\n\nAd Content\n\nAdvertisement: Checkfox\n\nExperten einig: Solar lohnt sich nur, wenn Ihr Dach...Advertisement: Checkfox\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Treppenlift Testsieger\n\nKein Scherz: Das kostet ein Treppenlift 2024 dank dieser\nJungunternehmerinAdvertisement: Treppenlift Testsieger\n\nUndo\n\nAdvertisement: Viessmann\n\nWelche W\u00e4rmepumpe passt zu mir?
