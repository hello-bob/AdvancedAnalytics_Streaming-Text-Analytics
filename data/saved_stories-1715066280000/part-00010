My client insisted that the media be delivered as compact discs\nand not as digital files in an MP3 player or other similar device. One of the\nsource recordings was on a compact disc and in AIFF format. As such my client\ncould not play this media that contained her husband\u2019s voice. I was able to\nconvert it using Audacity, and then was able to burn it to a compact disc with\nBrasero, which has been my go to CD creation tool.\n\nThe balance of the audio files were in MP3 format. I was able to create\ncompact discs with Brasero very quickly. However, one file was so large that\nit exceeded the capacity of the compact disc medium. This large file contained\nnearly two hours of audio. The capacity of compact discs is 72 minutes.\n\nThis presented a problem. How could I split the large file into smaller\nsegments that would allow me to create media and fit on media that my client\ncould use? I decided to use a DVD instead of a compact disc. Using a DVD\nprovided me with a much larger capacity disc, but how could I convert the MP3\nfiles to a format that would allow me to create a DVD? I tried using\nHandBrake, but was unable to convert MP3 to MP4 format because MP4 expected a\nvideo stream, and I had no video. Then I discovered that I could use FFmpeg to\nconvert the files.\n\n## How to convert media files with FFmpeg\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a powerful tool to help you with your audio and video\nfiles, look no further than FFmpeg. FFmpeg is highly versatile and able to\nsupport an impressive range of popular formats like MP3, MP4, and AVI. You can\nalso use it to convert files between different formats, which was very useful\nin my case.\n\nYou can easily install FFmpeg on your Linux system in a terminal on Fedora and\nsimilar distributions:\n\n    \n    \n    $ sudo dnf install ffmpeg\n\nOn Debian and similar distributions:\n\n    \n    \n    $ sudo apt install ffmpeg\n\nAccording to its man page, \u201cFFmpeg is a very fast video and audio converter\nthat can also grab from a live audio and video source. It can also convert\nbetween arbitrary sample rates and resize video on the fly with a high-quality\npolyphase filter.\u201d FFmpeg has excellent documentation and an extensive man\npage.\n\nThe command-line interface of this tool might seem daunting for newcomers, but\nthis feature is what makes it so powerful. Developers and system\nadministrators can easily write scripts to automate complex tasks. If you make\nthe most of this feature you can streamline your workflow like a pro.\n\nUsing the command-line interface, I was able to convert the MP3 file to the\nrequired MP4 format using the following command:\n\n    \n    \n    $ ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=black:s=1280x720:r=5 -i audio.mp3 -crf 0 -c:a copy -shortest output.mp4\n\nThe -f lavfi option sets a virtual input device as the source of the video\nstream. Essentially, this creates a video file (which a video DVD requires)\ninstead of an audio file. The audio file I actually care about gets included\nthanks to the -i audio.mp3 option. The video that gets created is a black\nscreen, as defined by -i:\n\n    \n    \n    color=c=black:s=1280x720:r=5\n\nI ran into a snag using Brasero with this new MP4 file. Brasero would not\ncreate a DVD without the addition of a couple of cstreamer codec. From some\nquick research, I found another open source DVD creation program called\nDevedeNG that had everything I needed built-in. Upon installing the DevedeNG\nprogram, I was able to create the DVD media in 20 minutes. Your time may vary,\ndepending on your computer system.\n\n## Solving problems with open source\n\nDevedeNG is licensed under GPLv3, while FFmpeg is licensed under the GNU\nLesser Public License (LGPLv2). FFmpeg is always evolving. The project is\nactively maintained and updated regularly, giving you the latest features,\nimprovements, and bug fixes so you can rest easy knowing your audio and video\nformats are supported.\n\nAnother way I could have resolved the space issue was by burning the MP3 audio\nas data files onto the DVD, leveraging the 4 GB of space available on the DVD\nfor just the audio data. The DVD would have basically been, in that scenario,\na hard drive. You\u2019d insert it into your computer and listen to the MP3 file\nthrough music player software.\n\nThe way I ended up burning the audio DVD created a media DVD, which is\nrecognized by either a computer or a DVD player. Because there\u2019s an \u201cempty\u201d\nvideo stream (it\u2019s actually not empty, it has black pixels in it), DVD players\nrecognize the media as a movie. This means that when you listen to the audio\ntrack, you\u2019re actually watching a blank video with accompanying audio.\n\nThere\u2019s no right or wrong way to solve these puzzles. What\u2019s important is that\nyou know how to get to the place you need to be. The goal was to preserve\naudio that was of particular importance to my client, and open source made it\npossible.\n\n## About the Author\n\nI am Don Watkins, a free and open source software (FOSS) advocate.\n\nRead Don's Full Bio\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0\nInternational License.\n\n#### Save the Date for All Things Open 2024\n\nJoin thousands of open source friends October 27-29 in downtown Raleigh for\nATO 2024!\n\nSave the Date 2024\n\n#### Upcoming Events\n\nWe do more than just All Things Open and Open Source 101.
