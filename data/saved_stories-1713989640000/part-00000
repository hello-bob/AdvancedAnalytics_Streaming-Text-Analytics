The text was sent the day of a conference call featuring Trump\ncampaign staffers and Republicans in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Is he talking about Ms. Berden?\" Donnini asked.\n\nBerden has been a longtime Republican activist in Michigan and was Michigan's\nRepublican national committeewoman at the time of the 2020 election.\n\nShock responded to the question by saying he interpreted \"guys\" as a male\nterm.\n\nIn response, from the court's gallery, state Rep. Matt Maddock, R-Milford,\nhusband of GOP elector Meshawn Maddock, replied, \"Give me a break.\"\n\nThe Republican electors signed the document falsely claiming Trump won on Dec.\n14, 2020.\n\nMore: Trump campaign recognized legal risks of false electors, still went\nforward\n\nDonnini said if Roman hadn't block the conditional language from Michigan's\ncertificate, there would have been no charges against the Republicans whose\nnames appeared on the document.\n\nRoman is facing criminal charges in Georgia as part of an investigation into\nTrump's efforts to overturn the election in that state, including conspiracy\nto commit forgery.\n\nDonnini noted that Chesebro had told Michigan investigators that he felt\nmisled by the Trump campaign's handling of the false elector certificates.\n\n\"Ms. Berden feels the same way,\" Donnini said.\n\nThe back-and-forth on Tuesday in Ingham County District Court highlighted the\nfifth day of preliminary examinations for the six GOP electors. Lawyers for\nthe electors spent much of the day questioning Shock and assailing the\nallegations brought against their clients by Nessel's office.\n\nThe attorneys cited lingering concerns in December 2020 about the election and\nother prosecutors' decisions to pass on the cases that Nessel's team pursued.\n\nDefense lawyers argued on Tuesday that their clients had been advised to sign\nthe certificate as a contingency by attorneys who were working with the Trump\ncampaign in case there was some development that reversed Democrat Joe Biden's\nvictory.\n\nAt one point, Donnini noted the federal indictment of Trump by special counsel\nJack Smith said some false electors \"were tricked into participating\" in the\nplot based on the understanding that their votes would only be used if\nlawsuits overturned Biden's win.\n\n\"Do you think that Kathy Berden was tricked into participating on Dec. 14,\n2020?\u201d Donnini asked Shock.\n\n\"No,\" Shock replied.\n\nThe differing stances on the electors' mindsets could be crucial because for\nthe forgery charges to be successful, prosecutors must prove that the electors\nhad an intent to defraud, under Michigan law.\n\n## 'Brainwashed' or believer?\n\nIn the ongoing preliminary examinations, Ingham County District Court Judge\nKristen Simmons will eventually determine whether Nessel's office has\npresented enough evidence to show there is probable cause to believe that\ncrimes occurred.\n\nNessel, a Democrat, has argued that the false electors' actions \"undermined\nthe public\u2019s faith in the integrity of our elections\" and \"plainly violated\nthe laws by which we administer our elections in Michigan.\"\n\nThe attorney general announced charges against the 16 Republicans in July. Six\nof them are in court this week for their preliminary examinations, one has\nreached a cooperation deal with Nessel's team, and the other nine are\nscheduled to face their exams beginning May 28.\n\nDonnini said on Tuesday that Ingham County prosecutors and the U.S. Attorney's\noffice in the Western District passed on charging the Michigan false electors\nbefore Nessel went forward with the charges.\n\nAndrew Stevens, an assistant prosecutor in Ingham County, penned a memo in\n2021, saying the certificate that falsely claimed Trump won Michigan's 16\nelectoral votes was a \"political stunt\" and not worthy of criminal charges. At\nthe time, Stevens wrote there was \"not any evidence\" to prove the false\nelectors had an intent to defraud.\n\nSimilarly, Donnini noted that Nessel was recorded last year telling a liberal\ngroup that the false electors had been \"brainwashed\" and \"genuinely\" believed\nthat Trump won Michigan's election.\n\n\"How can someone genuinely believe something and yet have, at the same time,\nknowingly committed a crime?\u201d Donnini asked Shock.\n\nShock replied by saying it was akin to someone attempting to rob a bank while\nbelieving the money belonged to them.\n\nLawyer Mary Chartier, who's representing GOP elector John Haggard of\nCharlevoix, asked if the Attorney General's office had addressed Nessel's\ncomments internally.\n\n\"Has anyone discussed in a Teams meeting or anything else, the conflict\nbetween Attorney General saying that the electors genuinely believed in the\nprocess, in what they were doing, and a prosecution based on intent to\ndefraud?\u201d Chartier asked.\n\nShock said not to his knowledge.\n\n## Judge issues warning\n\nAt the beginning of Tuesday's proceedings, Simmons warned the GOP electors and\ntheir lawyers not to take photographs of witnesses and not to post disparaging\nremarks about them online.\n\nSuch actions are \"ridiculous\" and could amount to witness intimidation, which\ncan lead to a criminal charge, Simmons said.\n\n\"If it appears that you're taking a photo, I'm going to have to take your\nphone and have it searched,\" Simmons said. \"Because we're not going to have\nwitnesses being intimidated when they're coming in here, under a subpoena, to\ngive testimony.\"\n\ncmauger@detroitnews.com\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\n  * Help\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Site Map\n  * Responsible Disclosure\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper\n\n## About Your Privacy\n\nClicking on the \"Reject All\" Button retains the default setting of only\nstrictly necessary cookies.\n\nWe and our 71 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
