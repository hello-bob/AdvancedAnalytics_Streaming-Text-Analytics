The company\u2019s clients range across Europe, the United Kingdom,\nand the United States, so Schwarzmann often finds himself moving between poles\nof the global economy. While traveling, he turns to Foursquare for\nrecommendations about where to eat and drink. \u201cIt knows what I like,\u201d he says.\n\nEvery time Schwarzmann alights in a foreign city he checks the app, which\nlists food, nightlife, and entertainment recommendations with the help of a\nsocial network-augmented algorithm. Then he heads toward the nearest suggested\ncafe. But over the past few years, something strange has happened. \u201cEvery\ncoffee place looks the same,\u201d Schwarzmann says. The new cafe resembles all the\nother coffee shops Foursquare suggests, whether in Odessa, Beijing, Los\nAngeles, or Seoul: the same raw wood tables, exposed brick, and hanging Edison\nbulbs.\n\n\"Digital platforms like Foursquare are producing \u201ca harmonization of tastes\u201d\"\n\nIt\u2019s not that these generic cafes are part of global chains like Starbucks or\nCosta Coffee, with designs that spring from the same corporate cookie cutter.\nRather, they have all independently decided to adopt the same faux-artisanal\naesthetic. Digital platforms like Foursquare are producing \u201ca harmonization of\ntastes\u201d across the world, Schwarzmann says. \u201cIt creates you going to the same\nplace all over again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how social media shapes our interactions on the internet,\nthrough web browsers, feeds, and apps. Yet technology is also shaping the\nphysical world, influencing the places we go and how we behave in areas of our\nlives that didn\u2019t heretofore seem so digital. Think of the traffic app Waze\nrerouting cars in Los Angeles and disrupting otherwise quiet neighborhoods;\nAirbnb parachuting groups of international tourists into residential\ncommunities; Instagram spreading IRL lifestyle memes; or Foursquare sending\ntraveling businessmen to the same cafe over and over again.\n\nWe could call this strange geography created by technology \u201cAirSpace.\u201d It\u2019s\nthe realm of coffee shops, bars, startup offices, and co-live / work spaces\nthat share the same hallmarks everywhere you go: a profusion of symbols of\ncomfort and quality, at least to a certain connoisseurial mindset. Minimalist\nfurniture. Craft beer and avocado toast. Reclaimed wood. Industrial lighting.\nCortados. Fast internet. The homogeneity of these spaces means that traveling\nbetween them is frictionless, a value that Silicon Valley prizes and cultural\ninfluencers like Schwarzmann take advantage of. Changing places can be as\npainless as reloading a website. You might not even realize you\u2019re not where\nyou started.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to travel all around the world and never leave AirSpace, and\nsome people don\u2019t. Well-off travelers like Kevin Lynch, an ad executive who\nlived in Hong Kong Airbnbs for three years, are abandoning permanent houses\nfor digital nomadism. Itinerant entrepreneurs, floating on venture capital,\nmight head to a Bali accelerator for six months as easily as going to the\ngrocery store. AirSpace is their home.\n\n\"Minimalist furniture. Craft beer and avocado toast. Reclaimed wood.\nIndustrial lighting. Cortados\"\n\nAs the geography of AirSpace spreads, so does a certain sameness.\nSchwarzmann\u2019s cafe phenomenon recalls what the architect Rem Koolhaas noticed\nin his prophetic essay \u201cThe Generic City,\u201d from the 1995 book S,M,L,XL: \u201cIs\nthe contemporary city like the contemporary airport\u2014\u2018all the same\u2019?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWhat if this seemingly accidental\u2014and usually regretted\u2014homogenization were\nan intentional process, a conscious movement away from difference toward\nsimilarity?\u201d\n\nYet AirSpace is now less theory than reality. The interchangeability,\nceaseless movement, and symbolic blankness that was once the hallmark of\nhotels and airports, qualities that led the French anthropologist Marc Aug\u00e9 to\ndefine them in 1992 as \u201cnon-places,\u201d has leaked into the rest of life.\n\nAs an affluent, self-selecting group of people move through spaces linked by\ntechnology, particular sensibilities spread, and these small pockets of\ngeography grow to resemble one another, as Schwarzmann discovered: the coffee\nroaster Four Barrel in San Francisco looks like the Australian Toby\u2019s Estate\nin Brooklyn looks like The Coffee Collective in Copenhagen looks like Bear\nPond Espresso in Tokyo. You can get a dry cortado with perfect latte art at\nany of them, then Instagram it on a marble countertop and further spread the\naesthetic to your followers.\n\nThis confluence of style is being accelerated by companies that foster a sense\nof placelessness, using technology to break down geography. Airbnb is a\nprominent example. Even as it markets unique places as consumable goods, it\nhelps its users travel without actually having to change their environment, or\nleave the warm embrace of AirSpace.\n\nFounded in 2008 by two graduates of the Rhode Island School of Design, Airbnb\nallows \u201chosts\u201d to rent out unused space in their own homes. It now includes\nmore than 2 million spaces in over 190 countries. \u201cExperience a place like you\nlive there,\u201d is the company\u2019s current credo. It heralds \u201ca world where you can\nbelong anywhere.\u201d\n\nAirbnb\u2019s early website design, when it was still called AirBed & Breakfast,\nwas Craigslist-rough and functionalist, promoting shots of hosts or scenery\nover interior decorating (\u201cbetter than a cheap hotel,\u201d its embedded title text\nread). By late 2012, it settled into the house-porn format it embraces today,\nwith high-resolution, full-bleed images that could have been pulled from the\npages of Dwell. The listings are presented not just as convenient hotel\nalternatives, but places where users would love to live permanently. The\naspirational quality helped the company to blow past predecessors like\nCouchsurfing.org, which championed the experience of intruding in someone\nelse\u2019s life rather than roleplaying being a local. In a sense, Airbnb became\nan interactive lifestyle magazine.\n\n\"The ideal Airbnb is both unfamiliar and completely recognizable\"\n\nIn 2011, a New York artist and designer named Laurel Schwulst started perusing\nAirbnb listings across the world in part to find design inspiration for her\nown apartment. \u201cI viewed it almost as Google Street View for inside homes,\u201d\nshe says. Schwulst began saving images that appealed to her and posting them\non a Tumblr called \u201dModern Life Space.\u201d But she had a creeping feeling\nsomething was happening across the platform. \u201cThe Airbnb experience is\nsupposed to be about real people and authenticity,\u201d Schwulst says. \u201cBut so\nmany of them were similar,\u201d whether in Brooklyn, Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul,\nor Santiago.\n\nThere was the prevalence of mass-produced but tasteful furniture, for one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an extension of Ikea showrooms,\u201d she says. But the similarities\nwent beyond mass-production. The ideal Airbnb is both unfamiliar and\ncompletely recognizable: a sprinkling of specific cultural symbols of a place\nmixed with comprehensible devices, furniture, and decoration. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how\nyou want these really generic things but also want authenticity, too,\u201d\nSchwulst says.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s advertising dwells in this paradox. A 2014 spot appropriates the\nnauseous, dissociative glamour of Lost in Translation\u2019s Tokyo tourism in a\nseries of shots out of various windows, looking into the foreign from a safe\ndistance. In April of this year, another spot parodied tourist behavior \u2014\nselfie sticks, Segway tours \u2014 and set it against the \u201cauthentic\u201d activities \u2014\nfalling asleep on the couch reading a book or watching your child build a\npillow fort \u2014 enabled by a stay with one of the platform\u2019s hosts. It offered a\nvision of possessiveness, in which visitors consume recognizable symbols\nrather than encountering unfamiliar ones: \u201cThe local coffee shop is yours,\ntoo.\u201d\n\nAaron Taylor Harvey, one of the leaders of Airbnb\u2019s environments team, which\noversees the design of the company\u2019s offices around the world, has also\nnoticed this pleasant sameness (Harvey estimates he has stayed at over 60\nAirbnbs). While Airbnb doesn\u2019t offer any decorating standards besides a few\ntips posted on their website (\u201cshow personality, not personal items,\u201d one\nreads), the existence of the platform itself and the needs of its users\nenables a certain sameness to spread. \u201cYou can feel a kind of trend in certain\nlistings. There\u2019s an International Airbnb Style that\u2019s starting to happen,\u201d\nHarvey continues. \u201cI think that some of it is really a wonderful thing that\ngives people a sense of comfort and immediate belonging when they travel, and\nsome of it is a little generic. It can go either way.\u201d\n\n\"\u201cThe industrial look and the mid-century... as long as it doesn\u2019t look\ncluttered and old.\u201d\"\n\nHotels have long sold visions of comfort and stability, and Airbnb is evolving\ntoward replicating the hotel industry it disrupted. In 2013, the company hired\nChip Conley, the founder of the Joie de Vivre hotel group, as its head of\nglobal hospitality and strategy. But what makes Airbnb different is its\ndecentralization. Like Schwarzmann\u2019s copycat cafes, its aesthetic arises from\ntens of thousands of people making the same independent decisions rather than\na corporate mandate. The Airbnb marketplace is evolving toward its most\neffective product; it seems that what consumers want more than an exotic\nexperience is something like a Days Inn but more stylish and less obvious \u2014 a\ngeneric space hidden behind a seemingly unique facade.\n\nYet Airbnb would prefer to dispel any association with the non-local. When I\nasked Harvey to clarify his definition of International Airbnb Style in\nwriting, a PR rep interjected, and stopped our correspondence short: \u201cEach\nhost and guest will have their own personal thoughts on this phrase.\u201d However,\nsome characteristics jump to mind: white or bright accent walls, raw wood,\nNespresso machines, Eames chairs, patterned rugs on bare floors, open\nshelving, the neutered Scandinavianism of HGTV. \u201cThe industrial look and the\nmid-century,\u201d suggests Natascha Folens, an interior decorator and Airbnb\nconsultant in the Washington, DC area. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t look cluttered\nand old.\u201d\n\nInternational Airbnb Style may be associated with comfort and accessibility,\nbut it is far from equally accessible to everyone. Earlier this year, Quirtina\nCrittenden, a business consultant in Chicago, started the hashtag\n#AirbnbWhileBlack to highlight experiences of discrimination on the platform,\nlike hosts accepting reservations from an account with a white or anonymous\navatar and denying a dark-skinned one. The observation was reinforced by a\nHarvard Business School study finding that users with stereotypically African-\nAmerican names were 16 percent less likely to be accepted by hosts. It\u2019s an\nissue the company knows it has to address; it recently appointed former Peace\nCorps director David King in the new position of \u201cdirector of diversity and\nbelonging.\u201d\n\n\"\u201cThey are branding their company with our life.\u201d\"\n\nMeanwhile, International Airbnb Style continues to reproduce, sometimes by\noutright appropriation. Zo\u00e9 de Las Cases and Benjamin Dew\u00e9, a French interior\ndesigner couple, were shocked when they discovered that Airbnb had replicated\nthe design of an apartment that they listed on the platform for a meeting room\nin the company\u2019s San Francisco corporate office, down to a trio of faux-\nindustrial pendant lights, a twee chalkboard, and a floating shelf full of\nalmost identical art objects (in 2012 Airbnb itself had rented Las Cases and\nDew\u00e9\u2019s space to host a party). The couple sued Airbnb in late 2015. \u201cThey are\nbranding their company with our life,\u201d Dew\u00e9 told BuzzFeed. In making the\nreplica rooms, company designers would \u201creproduce the exact sofa, as close as\nthey could to the exact chair,\u201d recalls Lisa Bottom, a design director at\nGensler, the architecture firm that designed the office in 2014.\n\nBottom says the meeting rooms were the brainchild of Airbnb founders Joe\nGebbia and Brian Chesky, the RISD graduates. Gensler arranged the company\u2019s\nmeeting rooms around an atrium so that, \u201cwhen you looked up through the atrium\nspace, it was like looking at little snapshots of various cities,\u201d Bottom\nsays. All places, in one place. Imagine traveling across continents in a\npilgrimage to the headquarters of the company that helps you open your house\nto strangers only to find yourself \u2014 at home.\n\nYet other startups are creating this globalized sameness-as-a-service in a\nself-enclosed package, a holistic AirSpace lifestyle.\n\nI met Bruno Haid in a cafe that Igor Schwarzmann could have been describing,\nan austere garage in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, full of blonde wood, understated\nleather furniture, and motorcycle gear, which the shop also sells. Haid is the\nfounder of Roam, an international \u201cco-living\u201d startup that promises its users\n\u2014 \u201cRoamers\u201d \u2014 the ability to move freely across residences in different\ncountries for a monthly fee of $2,000 (or $500 per week). The company raised\n$3.4 million in funding in May, and currently manages spaces in Ubud, Bali;\nMiami; and Madrid. Buenos Aires and London are coming soon.\n\nThe properties vary: Roam Madrid is in an ornate 19th century building\npreviously owned by the Vatican, and Ubud is a former boutique hotel. But they\nshare a basic structure: \u201ca shared kitchen, even-sized private bedrooms, all\nhave private bathrooms. The communal areas always have a really nice co-\nworking space, always have high-end physical networking gear,\u201d Haid says. In\nevery workspace, \u201cwherever you go we have those Eames aluminum chairs. We\nlooked at so many different chairs and they are the best.\u201d Other flourishes\ninclude tulip tables, wide communal desks, and attenuated wire lamps.\n\n\"Aesthetic homogeneity is a product that users are coming to demand, and tech\ninvestors are catching on\"\n\nThrough its network of digitally linked spaces, Roam guarantees that you can\ncook in the same kitchen and sit in the same chair under the same light\nanywhere in the world. Like similar startups Common and Breather (or WeWork\u2019s\nWeLive), the company is betting that this experience is now what we prefer to\nconstructing our own unique spaces. It\u2019s \u201ca professional nomadic community,\u201d\nsays David Cornthwaite, a self-identified adventurer and blogger who was one\nof the first residents at Roam Ubud. \u201cWe had an almost full house, 24 rooms,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cIt was a perfect space.\u201d\n\nAesthetic homogeneity is a product that users are coming to demand, and tech\ninvestors are catching on. With Airbnb, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re at a Holiday Inn\nthat\u2019s the exact same everywhere, but there\u2019s a feeling of familiarity even in\nthe midst of diversity,\u201d says Kanyi Maqubela, a venture partner at\nCollaborative Fund, which invested in Roam. \u201cI can stay in other people\u2019s\nhomes with them, eat apples they got from their own farmer\u2019s market.\u201d\n\nSchwarzmann critiqued the lack of locality in generic places, but Haid\u2019s\ncompany suggests a different, paradoxical definition of locality: desirable\nplaces should be both specific enough to be interesting and generic enough to\nbe as convenient as possible, consumed quickly and easily \u2014 equal parts\nauthentic and expendable. In his 1992 book Non-Places, Marc Aug\u00e9, the French\nanthropologist, wrote that with the emergence of such identity-less space,\n\u201cpeople are always, and never, at home.\u201d If we can be equally at home\neverywhere, as Roam and Airbnb suggest, doesn\u2019t that mean we are also at home\nnowhere? The next question is, do we mind?\n\nThe profusion of generic cafes and Eames chairs and reclaimed wood tables\nmight be a superficial meme of millennial interior decorating that will fade\nwith time. But the anesthetized aesthetic of International Airbnb Style is the\nsymptom of a deeper condition, I think.\n\nWhy is AirSpace happening? One answer is that the internet and its progeny \u2014\nFoursquare, Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb \u2014 is to us today what television was\nin the last century, with \u201ca certain ability to transmit and receive and then\napply layers of affection and longing and doubt,\u201d as George W.S. Trow wrote in\nhis paranoiac masterpiece of media criticism, \u201cWithin the Context of No\nContext,\u201d originally published in The New Yorker in 1980. But instead of\nTrow\u2019s \u201cgrid of 200 million,\u201d American television viewers, we now have a\nglobal grid of 1.6 billion: Facebook\u2019s population of monthly active users, all\nacting and interacting more or less within the same space, learning to see and\nfeel and want the same things.\n\n\"Urban areas around the world might increasingly resemble each other and\nbecome interchangeable\"\n\nThe connective emotional grid of social media platforms is what drives the\nimpression of AirSpace. If taste is globalized, then the logical endpoint is a\nworld in which aesthetic diversity decreases. It resembles a kind of\ngentrification: one that happens concurrently across global urban centers.\nJust as a gentrifying neighborhood starts to look less diverse as buildings\nare renovated and storefronts replaced, so economically similar urban areas\naround the world might increasingly resemble each other and become\ninterchangeable.\n\nIn their introduction to The Fabric of Cultures: Fashion, Identity, and\nGlobalization, the fashion scholars Eugenia Paulicelli and Hazel Clark write\nthat this \u201caesthetic gentrification... divides the new world map in the light\nof a softer post-Cold War prejudice: the fashionable and the unfashionable\nworld.\u201d In other words, we are experiencing an isolationism of style versus\none of politics or physical geography, though it still falls along economic\nlines. You either belong to the AirSpace class or you don\u2019t.\n\nThe homogeneity induced by this division can become stifling, to that point\nthat opting out appears the better option. Rochelle Short was an Airbnb\nSuperhost in Seattle (the designation requires many guests, high response\nrates, and perfect reviews). She started on the platform in 2013 and became a\nkind of guru for hosts through her blog, Letting People In. But she stopped\nhosting this year, as Airbnb itself has in a way become gentrified.\n\n\u201cI think the demographic started to change,\u201d Short says. In 2013, Airbnb felt\nlike a true social experiment, \u201cpioneering new territory, attracting people\nwho were open-minded, easy-going, don\u2019t worry if there\u2019s a fleck on the mirror\nin the bathroom.\u201d By 2016, she explains, it \u201cbecame the vanilla tourist who\nwanted the Super 8 motel experience. I don\u2019t like these travelers as much as\nthe earlier days.\u201d\n\nThis year, Airbnb moved from passively shaping the spaces users inhabit, to\nchanging the way they travel by creating in-app guidebooks that will provide\nFoursquare-like recommendations to guests based on host tips. Just this week,\nthe company also announced Samara, an in-house design and engineering studio\nthat will \u201cpioneer services for connection, commerce, and social change within\nand around the expanding Airbnb community,\u201d Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia said\nin the press release. Samara\u2019s first residence and community center in Nara\nPrefecture, Japan, Gebbia suggests, will enable a kind of voyeurism for\nforeign tourists: \u201cI picture Western guests walking up, stepping inside, and\nyou\u2019re interacting with the community from the minute you arrive,\u201d he told\nFast Company.\n\nYet the AirSpace aesthetic that Airbnb has contributed to, and the geography\nit creates, limits experiences of difference in the service of comforting a\nparticular demographic (\u201cthe vanilla tourist\u201d) falsely defined as the norm. It\nis a \u201challucination of the normal,\u201d as Koolhaas writes. This is the harmful\nillusion that so much technology, and technological culture, perpetuates: if\nyou do not fit within its predefined structures as an effective user, you must\nbe doing something wrong. Says Schwarzmann, \u201cIt\u2019s a bubble, a lot of things\nthat are reinforcing our bubble. I\u2019m definitely part of the described problem.\nWhite, male, privileged and I travel a lot.\u201d\n\n\"\u201cA lot of things that are reinforcing our bubble. I\u2019m definitely part of the\ndescribed problem\u201d\"\n\nAmong the phenomenon\u2019s consequences is depersonalization, in the psychiatric\nsense: \u201ca state in which one loses all sense of identity.\u201d I personally like\nthe AirSpace style. I can\u2019t say no to a tasteful, clean, modern life space.\nBut thinking through its roots and negative implications makes me reconsider\nmy attachment. It\u2019s hard to identify with something so empty at its core.\n\nIn the advent of AirSpace, our options are limited. The first is finding \u201cthe\nadvantages of blankness,\u201d as Koolhaas writes, becoming connoisseurs of \u201cthe\ncolor variations in the fluorescent lighting of an office building just before\nsunset, the subtleties of the slightly different whites of an illuminated sign\nat night.\u201d Kanyi Maqubela, the Roam investor, sees meaning in the generic from\nan unexpected source. \u201cIf you go to Catholic church in most parts of the\nworld, the mass is going to feel like the mass. There is still a sense of\nunity,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to enter the world where these private\ncompanies have some of that magic to them, the notion of feeling at home\nacross time zones in any country.\u201d\n\nSuggesting that Airbnb could become the next Vatican is a stretch, however.\nWhile it would be impossible to stop the spread of the generic style\u2014like\ntrying to stop all hotels from looking the same\u2014there are still steps to\nconsider against the imperfect frictionlessness of the territory it occupies.\nThis could come in the form of legislation that resists the spread of services\nlike Airbnb (as Berlin, Paris, New York and San Francisco are considering), or\na simple personal choice to become more invested in the local than the mobile\n\u2014 to opt for the flawed community bed & breakfast rather than the temporary,\nimmaculate apartment. Seeking out difference is important, particularly when\ntechnology makes it so easy to avoid doing so.\n\nLeft unchecked, there is a kind of nightmare version of AirSpace that could\nspread room by room, cafe by cafe across the world. It\u2019s already there, if you\nlook for it. There are blank white lofts with subway-tile bathrooms, modular\nfurniture, wall-mounted TVs, high-speed internet, and wide, viewless windows\nin every city, whether it\u2019s downtown Madrid; N\u00f8rrebro, Copenhagen; or Gulou,\nBeijing. Once you take the place of the people who live there, you can head\nout to their favorite coffee shops, bars, or workspaces, which will be\ninstantly recognizable because they look just like the apartment that you\u2019re\nliving in. You will probably enjoy it. You might think, \u2018This is nice, I am\ncomfortable.\u2019 And then you can move on to the next one, only a click away.\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a Vox Media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
