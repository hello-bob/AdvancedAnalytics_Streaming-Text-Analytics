Understanding exactly how lightning forms is key for\nreducing risk, but because lightning phenomena occur on sub-millisecond\ntimescales, direct measurements are extremely difficult to obtain.\n\nNow, researchers from the Electromagnetic Compatibility Lab, led by Farhad\nRachidi, in EPFL\u2019s School of Engineering have for the first time directly\nmeasured an elusive phenomenon that explains a lot about the birth of a\nlightning bolt: X-ray radiation. In a collaborative study with the University\nof Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland and Uppsala University in Sweden,\nthey recorded lightning strikes at the S\u00e4ntis tower in northeastern\nSwitzerland, identifying X-rays associated with the beginning of upward\npositive flashes. These flashes start with negatively charged tendrils\n(leaders) that ascend stepwise from a high-altitude object, before connecting\nwith a thundercloud, transferring positive charge to the ground.\n\n\u201cAt sea level, upward flashes are rare, but could become the dominant type at\nhigh altitudes. They also have the potential to be more damaging, because in\nan upward flash, lightning remains in contact with a structure for longer than\nit does during a downward flash, giving it more time to transfer electrical\ncharge,\u201d explains Electromagnetic Compatibility Lab PhD candidate Toma Oregel-\nChaumont.\n\nAlthough X-ray emissions have previously been observed from other types of\nlightning, this is the first time they have been captured from upward positive\nflashes. Oregel-Chaumont, the first author on a recent Nature Scientific\nReports paper describing the observations, says that they offer valuable\ninsights into how lightning \u2013 and upward lightning in particular \u2013 forms.\n\n\u201cThe actual mechanism by which lightning initiates and propagates is still a\nmystery. The observation of upward lightning from tall structures like the\nS\u00e4ntis tower makes it possible to correlate X-ray measurements with other\nsimultaneously measured quantities, like high-speed video observations and\nelectric currents.\u201d\n\nA unique observation opportunity\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps not surprising that the novel observations were made in\nSwitzerland, as the S\u00e4ntis tower offers unique and ideal measurement\nconditions. The 124-meter tower is perched atop a high peak of the Appenzell\nAlps, making it a prime lightning target. There is a clear line of sight from\nneighboring peaks, and the expansive research facility is packed with high-\nspeed cameras, X-ray detectors, electric field sensors, and current-measuring\ndevices.\n\nCrucially, the speed and sensitivity of this equipment allowed the team to see\na difference between negative leader steps that emitted X-rays and those that\ndid not, supporting a theory of lightning formation known as the cold runaway\nelectron model. In a nutshell, the association of X-rays with very rapid\nelectric field changes supported the theory that sudden increases in the air\u2019s\nelectric field causes ambient electrons to \u201crun away\u201d and become a plasma:\nlightning.\n\n\u201cAs a physicist, I like to be able to understand the theory behind\nobservations, but this information is also important for understanding\nlightning from an engineering perspective: More and more high-altitude\nstructures, like wind turbines and aircraft, are being built from composite\nmaterials. These are less conductive than metals like aluminum, so they heat\nup more, making them vulnerable to damage from upward lightning,\u201d Oregel-\nChaumont says.\n\nThe observations at S\u00e4ntis \u2013 which receives over 100 lightning strikes every\nyear \u2013 are ongoing. Next, the scientists plan to add a microwave sensor to the\ntower\u2019s arsenal of equipment; this could help determine whether the cold\nrunaway model also applies to downward lightning, as unlike X-rays, microwaves\ncan be measured from the clouds.\n\nReferences\n\nOregel-Chaumont, T., \u0160unjerga, A., Hettiarachchi, P. et al.
