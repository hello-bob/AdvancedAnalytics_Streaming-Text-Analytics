This means that active enforcement of\n> Vanguard will be in effect and working hard to make sure your queues are\n> free from scripters, botters, and cheaters! We recently released a blog\n> detailing the \u201cwhy\u201d behind bringing Vanguard to League that you can check\n> out here. It\u2019s a bit of a long read, but it does have some pictures.\n>\n> \u21ab Lilu Cabreros in the League of Legends patch notes\n\nThe basic gist is that Vanguard is a closed-source, kernel-level rootkit for\nWindows that runs at all times, with the supposed goal of detecting and\nbanning cheaters from playing League of Legends. This being a rootkit designed\nspecifically to inject itself into the Windows kernel, it won\u2019t work on Linux,\nand as such, the entire League on Linux community, which has been playing\nLeague for years now and even at times communicated with Riot employees to\nkeep the game running, is now gone.\n\nInterestingly enough, Riot is not implementing Vanguard on macOS, which League\nof Legends also supports \u2013 because Apple simply doesn\u2019t allow it.\n\nThis is probably the most invasive, disturbing form of anticheat we\u2019ve seen so\nfar, especially since it involves such a hugely popular game. It\u2019s doubly\nspicy because Riot Games is owned by Tencent, a Chinese company, which means a\ncompany owned and controlled by the Chinese government now has rootkits\ninstalled on the roughly 150 million players\u2019 computers all over the world.\nWhile we\u2019re all (rightly, in my opinion) worried about TikTok, China just\nslipped 150 million rootkits onto computers all over the world.\n\nOne really has to wonder where these increasingly invasive, anti-privacy and\nanti-user anticheat measures are going from here. Now that this rootkit can\nkeep tabs on literally every single thing you do on your Windows computer,\nwhat\u2019s going to be the next step? Anticheat might have to move towards using\nwebcams to watch you play to prevent you from cheating, because guess what?\nThe next level of cheating is already here, and it doesn\u2019t even involve your\ncomputer.\n\nEarlier this year, hardware maker MSI showed off a gaming monitor that uses\n\u201cAI\u201d to see what\u2019s going on on your monitor, and then injects overlays onto\nyour monitor to help you cheat. MSI showed off how the monitor will use the\nLeague of Legends minimap to follow enemy champions and other relevant\ncontent, and then show warnings on your screen when enemies approach from off-\nscreen. All of this happens entirely on the monitor\u2019s hardware, and never\nsends any data whatsoever to the computer it\u2019s attached to. It\u2019s cheating that\nliterally cannot be detected by anything running on your computer, rootkit or\nnot.\n\nSo, the only logical next step as such forms of cheating become more advanced\nand widespread is to force users to turn on their webcams, and point them at\ntheir displays.\n\nI fired up League of Legends today on my gaming computer \u2013 which runs Linux,\nof course \u2013 and after the League client \u201cinstalled\u201d the rootkit, it just got\nstuck in an endless loop of asking me to restart the client. I\u2019ve been playing\nLeague of Legends for close to 14 years, and while I know the game \u2013 and\nespecially its community \u2013 has a deservedly so bad reputation, I\u2019ve always\nenjoyed the game with friends, and especially with my wife, who\u2019s been playing\nfor years and years as well.\n\nSpeaking of my wife \u2013 even though she runs Windows and could easily install\nthe rootkit if she wanted to, she has some serious doubts about this. When I\nexplained what the Vanguard rootkit can do, her mouse pointer slowly moved\naway from the \u201cUpdate\u201d button, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about this...\u201d\n\n#### About The Author\n\n##### Thom Holwerda\n\nFollow me on Mastodon @thomholwerda@exquisite.social\n\n#### One Response\n\n  1. 2024-05-01 10:47 am\n\nssokolow (Hey, OSNews, U2F/WebAuthn is broken on Firefox!)\n\n> Interestingly enough, Riot is not implementing Vanguard on macOS, which\n> League of Legends also supports \u2013 because Apple simply doesn\u2019t allow it.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad Darling is so much younger and more incomplete than Wine.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n### Our Sponsor\n\n### Search OSNEWS\n\n### OSnews Accounts\n\n    * Create Account\n    * Login\n\n### Featured articles\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n    * Setting up a YubiKey on Linux is a mess, and it really shouldn\u2019t be\n    * Fedora change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release to KDE Plasma\n\n### Topics\n\n### Related Posts\n\n    * Nintendo unveils its new console: Nintendo Switch\n\nOctober 20, 2016 \u2022 43 Comments\n\n    * Microsoft acquires Mojang for $2.5 billion\n\nSeptember 15, 2014 \u2022 65 Comments\n\n    * Writing a Game Boy emulator\n\nJuly 11, 2018 \u2022 13 Comments\n\n    * Game Review: Left 4 Dead, XBox 360\n\nMarch 17, 2009 \u2022 27 Comments\n\n    * Virtual reality is going to change the world\n\nMarch 26, 2014 \u2022 47 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts\n\n    * Some personal news\n\nMarch 23, 2024 \u2022 69 Comments\n\n    * Linus Torvalds really prefers tabs\n\nApril 17, 2024 \u2022 64 Comments\n\n    * VMS Software guts its community licensing program\n\nApril 13, 2024 \u2022 50 Comments\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n\nApril 8, 2024 \u2022 46 Comments\n\n    * Hackintosh is (almost) dead\n\nMarch 17, 2024 \u2022 28 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts (Last 3 Years)\n\n    * Apple\u2019s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors take its in-house Arm-based chips to new heights\n\nOctober 18, 2021\n\n    * Microsoft is testing a desktop watermark for unsupported Windows 11 PCs\n\nFebruary 27, 2022\n\n    * Rant: year of Linux on the desktop\n\nDecember 29, 2022\n\n    * A few thoughts on Fuchsia security\n\nJune 14, 2021\n\n    * Apple intentionally kills web applications for EU users in iOS 17.4 onward to spite its EU users\n\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\n### About OSnews\n\nOSnews Privacy Statement \u00a9 OSnews Inc.
