The theory is grounded in\nclassic and modern psychiatric literature, is disciplined with micro data, and\nis formalized in a life-cycle heterogeneous agent framework. In our model,\nindividuals experiencing mental illness have pessimistic expectations and lose\ntime due to rumination. As a result, they work less, consume less, invest less\nin risky assets, and forego treatment which in turn reinforces mental illness.\nWe quantify the societal burden of mental illness and evaluate the efficacy of\nprominent policy proposals. We show that expanding the availability of\ntreatment services and improving treatment of mental illness in late\nadolescence substantially improve mental health and welfare.\n\nYou may have unlimited free access to working papers.
